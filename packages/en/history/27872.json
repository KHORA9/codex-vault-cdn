In Volume I.--though many of its subjects (not quite all) had\r\nbeen handled by me before in more or less summary fashion, or in reviews\r\nof individual books, or in other connections than that of the\r\nnovel--only Hamilton, Lesage, Marivaux, and the minor \"Sensibility\" men\r\nand women had formed the subjects of separate and somewhat detailed\r\nstudies, wholly or mainly as novelists. The case is altered in respect\r\nof the present volume. The _Essays on French Novelists_, to which I\r\nthere referred, contain a larger number of such studies appertaining to\r\nthe present division--studies busied with Charles de Bernard, Gautier,\r\nMurger, Flaubert, Dumas, Sandeau, Cherbuliez, Feuillet. On Balzac I have\r\npreviously written two papers of some length, one as an Introduction to\r\nMessrs. Dent's almost complete translation of the _Comédie_, with\r\nshorter sequels for each book, the other an article in the _Quarterly\r\nReview_ for 1907. Some dozen or more years ago I contributed to an\r\nAmerican edition[1] of translations of Mérimée by various hands, a long\r\n\"Introduction\" to that most remarkable writer, and I had, somewhat\r\nearlier, written on Maupassant for the _Fortnightly Review_. One or two\r\nadditional dealings of some substance with the subject might be\r\nmentioned, such as another Introduction to _Corinne_, but not to\r\n_Delphine_. These, however, and passages in more general _Histories_,\r\nhardly need specification.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I have never dealt, substantively and in detail, with\r\nChateaubriand, Paul de Kock, Victor Hugo, Beyle, George Sand, or Zola[2]\r\nas novelists, nor with any of the very large number of minors not\r\nalready mentioned, including some, such as Nodier and Gérard de Nerval,\r\nwhom, for one thing or another, I should myself very decidedly put above\r\nminority. And, further, my former dealings with the authors in the first\r\nlist given above having been undertaken without any view to a general\r\nhistory of the French novel, it became not merely proper but easy for me\r\nto \"triangulate\" them anew. So that though there may be more previous\r\nwork of mine in print on the subjects of the present volume than on\r\nthose of the last, there will, I hope, be found here actually less, and\r\nvery considerably less, _réchauffé_--hardly any, in fact (save a few\r\ntranslations[3] and some passages on Gautier and Maupassant)--of the\r\namount and character which seemed excusable, and more than excusable, in\r\nthe case of the \"Sensibility\" chapter there. The book, if not actually a\r\n\"Pisgah-sight reversed,\" taken from Lebanon instead of Pisgah after\r\nmore than forty years' journey, not in the wilderness, but in the\r\nPromised Land itself, attempts to be so; and uses no more than fairly\r\n\"reminiscential\" (as Sir Thomas Browne would say) notes, taken on that\r\njourney itself.\r\n\r\nIt was very naturally, and by persons of weight, put to me whether I\r\ncould not extend this history to, or nearer to, the present day. I put\r\nmy negative to this briefly in the earlier preface: it may be perhaps\r\ncourteous to others, who may be disposed to regret the refusal, to give\r\nit somewhat more fully here. One reason--perhaps sufficient in\r\nitself--can be very frankly stated. I do not _know_ enough of the French\r\nnovel of the last twenty years or so. During the whole of that time I\r\nhave had no reasons, of duty or profit, to oblige such knowledge. I have\r\nhad a great many other things to do, and I have found greater recreation\r\nin re-reading old books than in experimenting on new ones. I might, no\r\ndoubt, in the last year or two have made up the deficiency to some\r\nextent, but I was indisposed to do so for two, yea, three reasons, which\r\nseemed to me sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I have found, both by some actual experiment of my\r\nown, and, as it seems to me, by a considerable examination of the\r\nexperiments of other people, that to co-ordinate satisfactorily accounts\r\nof contemporary or very recent work with accounts of older is so\r\ndifficult as to be nearly impossible. The _foci_ are too different to be\r\neasily adjusted, and the result is almost always out of composition, if\r\nnot of drawing.\r\n\r\nSecondly, though I know I am here kicking against certain pricks, it\r\ndoes not appear to me, either from what I have read or from criticisms\r\non what I have not, that any definitely new and decisively illustrated\r\nschool of novels has arisen since the death of M. Zola.\r\n\r\nThirdly, it would be impossible to deal with the subject, save in an\r\nabsurdly incomplete fashion, without discussing living persons. To doing\r\nthis, in a book, I have an unfashionable but unalterable objection. The\r\nproductions of such persons, as they appear, are, by now established\r\ncustom, proper subjects for \"reviewing\" in accordance with the decencies\r\nof literature, and such reviews may sometimes, with the same proviso, be\r\nextended to studies of their work up to date. But even these latter\r\nshould, I think, be reserved for very exceptional cases.\r\n\r\nA slight difference of method may be observed in the treatment of\r\nauthors in Chapter X. and onwards, this treatment being not only\r\nsomewhat less judicial and more \"impressionist,\" but also more general\r\nand less buckrammed out with abstracts of particular works.[4] There\r\nappeared to me to be more than one reason for this, all such reasons\r\nbeing independent of, though by no means ignoring, the mechanical\r\npressure of ever-lessening space. In the first place, a very much larger\r\nnumber of readers may be presumed to be more or less familiar with the\r\nsubjects of discussion, thus not only making elaborate \"statement of\r\ncase\" and production of supporting evidence unnecessary, but exposing\r\nthe purely judicial attitude to the charge of \"no jurisdiction.\"\r\nMoreover, there is behind all this, as it seems to me, a really\r\nimportant principle, which is not a mere repetition, but a noteworthy\r\nextension, of that recently laid down. I rather doubt whether the\r\nabsolute historico-critical verdict and sentence can ever be pronounced\r\non work that is, even in the widest sense, contemporary. The \"firm\r\nperspective of the past\" can in very few instances be acquired: and\r\nthose few, who by good luck have acquired something of it, should not\r\npresume too much on this gift of fortune. General opinion of a man is\r\nduring his lifetime often wrong, for some time after his death almost\r\nalways so: and the absolute balance is very seldom reached till a full\r\ngeneration--something more than the conventional thirty years--has\r\npassed. Meanwhile, though all readers who have anything critical in them\r\nwill be constantly revising their impressions, it is well not to put\r\none's own out as more than impressions. It is only a very few years\r\nsince I myself came to what I may call a provisionally final estimate of\r\nZola, and I find that there is some slight alteration even in that\r\nwhich, from the first, I formed of Maupassant. I can hardly hope that\r\nreaders of this part of the work will not be brought into collision with\r\nexpressions of mine, more frequently than was the case in the first\r\nvolume or even the first part of this. But I can at least assure them\r\nthat I have no intention of playing Sir Oracle, or of trailing my coat.\r\n\r\nThe actual arrangement of this volume has been the subject of a good\r\ndeal of \"pondering and deliberation,\" almost as much as Sir Thomas\r\nBertram gave to a matter no doubt of more importance. There was a\r\nconsiderable temptation to recur to the system on which I have written\r\nsome other literary histories--that of \"Books\" and \"Interchapters.\" This\r\nI had abandoned, in the first volume, because it was not so much\r\ndifficult of application as hardly relevant. Here the relevance is much\r\ngreater. The single century divides itself, without the slightest\r\nviolence offered, into four parts, which, if I had that capacity or\r\npartiality for flowery writing, the absence of which in me some critics\r\nhave deplored, I might almost call Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.\r\nThere is the season, of little positive crop but important\r\nseed-sowing,--the season in which the greater writers, Chateaubriand and\r\nMme. de Staël, perform their office. Here, too, quite humble\r\nfolk--Pigault-Lebrun completing what has been already dealt with,\r\nDucray-Duminil and others doing work to be dealt with here, and Paul de\r\nKock most of all, get the novel of ordinary life ready in various ways:\r\nwhile others still, Nodier, Hugo, Vigny, Mérimée, and, with however\r\ndifferent literary value, Arlincourt, implant the New Romance. There is\r\nthe sudden, magnificent, and long-continued outburst of all the kinds in\r\nand after 1830. There is the autumn of the Second Empire, continuing and\r\nadding to the fruits and flowers of summer: and there is the gradual\r\ndecadence of the last quarter of the century, with some late blossoming\r\nand second-crop fruitage--the medlars of the novel--and the dying off of\r\nthe great producers of the past. But the breach of uniformity in formal\r\narrangement of the divisions would perhaps be too great to the eye\r\nwithout being absolutely necessary to the sense, and I have endeavoured\r\nto make the necessary recapitulation with a single \"halt\" of\r\nchapter-length[5] at the exact middle. It will readily be understood\r\nthat the loss of my own library has been even more severely felt in this\r\nvolume than in the earlier one, while circumstances, public and private,\r\nhave made access to larger collections more difficult. But I have\r\nendeavoured to \"make good\" as much as possible, and grumbling or\r\ncomplaining supplies worse than no armour against Fate.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes, perhaps rashly, during the writing of this book\r\nwondered \"What next\"? By luck for myself--whether also for my readers it\r\nwould be ill even to wonder--I have been permitted to execute all the\r\nliterary schemes I ever formed, save two. The first of these (omitting a\r\nwork on \"Transubstantiation\" which I planned at the age of thirteen but\r\ndid not carry far) was a _History of the English Scholastics_, which I\r\nthought of some ten years later, which was not unfavoured by good\r\nauthority, and which I should certainly have attempted, if other people\r\nat Oxford in my time had not been so much cleverer than myself that I\r\ncould not get a fellowship. It has, strangely enough, never been done\r\nyet by anybody; it would be a useful corrective to the exoteric chatter\r\nwhich has sometimes recently gone by the name of philosophy; and perhaps\r\nit might shake Signor Benedetto Croce (whom it is hardly necessary to\r\nsay I do _not_ include among the \"chatterers\") in his opinion that\r\nthough, as he once too kindly said, I am a _valente letterato_, I am\r\nsadly _digiúno di filosofia_.[6] But it is \"too late a week\" for this.\r\nAnd I have lost my library.\r\n\r\nThen there was a _History of Wine_, which was actually commissioned,\r\nplanned, and begun just before I was appointed to my Chair at Edinburgh,\r\nand which I gave up, not from any personal pusillanimity or loss of\r\ninterest in the subject, but partly because I had too much else to do,\r\nand because I thought it unfair to expose that respectable institution\r\nto the venom of the most unscrupulous of all fanatics--those of\r\nteetotalism. I could take this up with pleasure: but I have lost my\r\ncellar.\r\n\r\nWhat I should really like to do would be to translate _in extenso_ Dr.\r\nSommer's re-edition of the Vulgate Arthuriad. But I should probably die\r\nbefore I had done half of it; no publisher would undertake the risk of\r\nit; and if any did, \"Dora,\" reluctant to die, would no doubt put us both\r\nin 'prison for using so much paper. Therefore I had better be content\r\nwith the divine suggestion, and not spoil it by my human failure to\r\nexecute.\r\n\r\nAnd so I may say, for good, _Valete_ to the public, abandoning the rest\r\nof the leave-taking to their discretion.[7]\r\n\r\n    GEORGE SAINTSBURY.\r\n\r\n    1 ROYAL CRESCENT, BATH,\r\n        _Christmas_, 1918.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] It is perhaps worth while to observe that I did not \"edit\" this, and\r\nthat I had nothing whatever to do with any part of it except the\r\n_Introduction_ and my earlier translation of the _Chronique de Charles\r\nIX_, which was, I believe, reprinted in it.\r\n\r\n[2] In very great strictness an exception should perhaps be made for\r\nnotice of him, and of some others, in _The Later Nineteenth Century_\r\n(Edinburgh and London, 1907).\r\n\r\n[3] There will, for pretty obvious reasons, be fewer of these than in\r\nthe former volume. The texts are much more accessible; there is no\r\ndifficulty about the language, such as people, however unnecessarily,\r\nsometimes feel about French up to the sixteenth century; and the space\r\nis wanted for other things. If I have kept one or two of my old ones it\r\nis because they have won approval from persons whose approval is worth\r\nhaving, and are now out of print: while I have added one or two\r\nothers--to please myself. Translations--in some cases more than one or\r\ntwo--already exist, for those who read English only, of nearly the whole\r\nof Balzac, of all Victor Hugo's novels, of a great many of Dumas's, and\r\nof others almost innumerable.\r\n\r\n[4] The chief exceptions are Dumas _fils_, the earliest, and Maupassant,\r\nthe greatest except Flaubert and far more voluminous than Flaubert\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n[5] The most unexpected chorus of approval with which Volume I. was\r\nreceived by reviewers, and which makes me think, in regard to this, of\r\nthat unpleasant song of the Koreish \"After Bedr, Ohod,\" leaves little\r\nnecessity for defending points attacked. I have made a few addenda and\r\ncorrigenda to Volume I. to cover exceptions, and the \"Interchapter\" or\r\nits equivalent should contain something on one larger matter--the small\r\naccount taken here of French _criticism_ of the novel.\r\n\r\n[6] I wonder whether he was right, or whether the late Edward Caird was\r\nwhen he said, \"I don't think I ever had a pupil [and he was among the\r\nfirst inter-collegiate-lecturers] with more of the philosophical _ethos_\r\nthan you have. But you're too fond of getting into logical coaches and\r\nletting yourself be carried away in them.\" I think this was provoked by\r\na very undergraduate essay arguing that Truth, as actually realised, was\r\nuninteresting, while the possible forms of Falsehood, as conceivably\r\nrealisable in other circumstances, were of the highest interest.\r\n\r\n[7] I have to give, not only my usual thanks to Professors Elton, Ker,\r\nand Gregory Smith for reading my proofs, and making most valuable\r\nsuggestions, but a special acknowledgment to Professor Ker, at whose\r\nrequest Miss Elsie Hitchcock most kindly looked up for me, at the\r\nBritish Museum, the exact title of that striking novel of M. H. Cochin\r\n(_v. inf._ p. 554 _note_). I have, in the proper places, already thanked\r\nthe authorities of the _Reviews_ above mentioned; but I should like also\r\nto recognise here the liberality of Messrs. Rivington in putting the\r\ncontents of my _Essays on French Novelists_ entirely at my disposal. And\r\nI am under another special obligation to Dr. Hagbert Wright for giving\r\nme, of his own motion, knowledge and reading of the fresh batch of\r\nseventeenth-century novels noticed below (pp. xiv-xvi).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA AND CORRIGENDA FOR VOL. I\r\n\r\n\r\nP. 13.--\"The drawback of explanations is that they almost always require\r\nto be explained.\" Somebody, or several somebodies, must have said this;\r\nand many more people than have ever said it--at least in print--must\r\nhave felt it. The dictum applies to my note on this page. An entirely\r\nwell-willing reviewer thought me \"piqued\" at the American remark, and\r\nproceeded to intimate a doubt whether I knew M. Bédier's work, partly on\r\nlines (as to the _Cantilenae_) which I had myself anticipated, and\r\npartly on the question of the composition of the _chansons_ by this or\r\nthat person or class, in this or that place, at that or the other time.\r\nBut I had felt no \"pique\" whatever in the matter, and these latter\r\npoints fall entirely outside my own conception of the _chansons_. I look\r\nat them simply as pieces of accomplished literature, no matter how,\r\nwhere, in what circumstances, or even exactly when, they became so. And\r\nI could therefore by no possibility feel anything but pleasure at praise\r\nbestowed on this most admirable work in a different part of the field.\r\n\r\nP. 38, l. 27.--A protest was made, not inexcusably, at the\r\ncharacterisation of _Launfal_ as \"libellous.\" The fault was only one of\r\nphrasing, or rather of incompleteness. That beautiful story of a knight\r\nand his fairy love is one which I should be the last man in the world to\r\nabuse _as such_. But it contains a libel on Guinevere which is\r\nunnecessary and offensive, besides being absolutely unjustified by any\r\nother legend, and inconsistent with her whole character. It is of this\r\nonly that I spoke the evil which it deserves. If I had not, by mere\r\noversight, omitted notice of Marie de France (for which I can offer no\r\nexcuse except the usual one of hesitation in which place to put it and\r\nso putting it nowhere), I should certainly have left no doubt as to my\r\nopinion of Thomas Chester likewise. Anybody who wants this may find it\r\nin my _Short History of English Literature_, p. 194.\r\n\r\nP. 55, l. 3.--_Delete_ comma at \"French.\"\r\n\r\nP. 60, l. 6.--Insert \"and\" between \"half\" and \"illegitimate.\"\r\n\r\nP. 72, l. 4.--I have been warned of the \"change-over\" in \"Saracen\" and\r\n\"Christian\"--a slip of the pen which I am afraid I have been guilty of\r\nbefore now, though I have known the story for full forty years. But\r\nFloire, though a \"paynim,\" was not exactly a \"Saracen.\"\r\n\r\nP. 75, l. 2 from bottom.--_For_ \"his\" _read_ \"their.\"\r\n\r\nPp. 158-163.--When the first proofs of the present volume had already\r\nbegun to come in, Dr. Hagbert Wright informed me that the London Library\r\nhad just secured at Sotheby's (I believe partly from the sale of Lord\r\nEllesmere's books) a considerable parcel of early seventeenth-century\r\nFrench novels. He also very kindly allowed me perusal of such of these\r\nas I had not already noticed (from reading at the B. M.) in Vol. I. Of\r\nsome, if not all of them, on the principle stated in the Preface of that\r\nvol., I may say something here. There is the _Histoire des Amours de\r\nLysandre et de Caliste; avec figures_, in an Amsterdam edition of 1679,\r\nbut of necessity some sixty years older, since its author, the Sieur\r\nd'Audiguier, was killed in 1624. He says he wrote it in six months,\r\nduring three and a half of which he was laid up with eight\r\nsword-wounds--things of which it is itself full, with the appurtenant\r\ncombats on sea and land and in private houses, and all sorts of other\r\ndivertisements (he uses the word himself of himself) including a very\r\nagreeable ghost-host--a ghost quite free from the tautology and\r\ngrandiloquence which ghosts too often affect, though not so poetical as\r\nFletcher's. \"They told me you were dead,\" says his guest and\r\ninterlocutor, consciously or unconsciously quoting the _Anthology_. \"So\r\nI am,\" quoth the ghost sturdily. But he wants, as they so often do, to\r\nbe buried. This is done, and he comes back to return thanks, which is\r\nnot equally the game, and in fact rather bores his guest, who, to stop\r\nthis jack-in-the-box proceeding, begins to ask favours, such as that the\r\nghost will give him three days' warning of his own death. \"I will, _if I\r\ncan_,\" says the Appearance pointedly. The fault of the book, as of most\r\nof the novels of the period, is the almost complete absence of\r\ncharacter. But there is plenty of adventure, in England as well as in\r\nFrance, and it must be one of the latest stories in which the actual\r\ntourney figures, for Audiguier writes as of things contemporary and\r\ndedicates his book to Marie de Medicis.\r\n\r\n_Cléon ou le Parfait Confidant_ (Paris, 1665), and _Hattigé ou Les\r\nAmours au Roy de Tamaran_ (Cologne, 1676), the first anonymous, the\r\nsecond written by a certain G. de Brimond, and dedicated to an\r\nEnglishman of whom we are not specially proud--Harry Jermyn, Earl of St.\r\nAlbans--are two very little books, of intrinsic importance and interest\r\nnot disproportioned to their size. They have, however, a little of both\r\nfor the student, in reference to the extension of the novel _kind_. For\r\n_Cléon_ is rather like a \"fictionising\" of an inferior play of Moliere's\r\ntime; and _Hattigé_, with its privateering Chevalier de Malte for a hero\r\nand its Turkish heroine who coolly remarks \"L'infidélité a des charmes,\"\r\nmight have been better if the author had known how to make it so. Both\r\nthese books have, as has been said, the merit of shortness. Puget de la\r\nSerre's _La Clytié de la Cour_ (2 vols., Paris, 1635) cannot plead even\r\nthis; for it fills two fat volumes of some 1500 pages. I have sometimes\r\nbeen accused, both in France and in England, of unfairness to Boileau,\r\nbut I should certainly never quarrel with him for including La Serre\r\n(not, however, in respect of this book, I think) among his herd of\r\ndunces. Like most of the novels of its time, though it has not much\r\nactual _bergerie_ about it, it suggests the _Astrée_, but the contrast\r\nis glaring. Even among the group, I have seldom read, or attempted to\r\nread, anything duller. _Le Mélante du Sieur Vidal_ (Paris, 1624), though\r\nalso somewhat wordy (it has 1000 pages), is much more Astréean, and\r\ntherefore, perhaps, better. Things do happen in it: among other\r\nincidents a lover is introduced into a garden in a barrow of clothes,\r\nthough he has not Sir John Falstaff's fate. There are fresh laws of\r\nlove, and discussions of them; a new debate on the old Blonde _v._\r\nBrunette theme, which might be worse, etc. etc. The same year brought\r\nforth _Les Chastes Amours d'Armonde_ by a certain Damiron, which, as its\r\ntitle may show, belongs rather to the pre-Astréean group (_v. sup._ Vol.\r\nI. p. 157 _note_), and contains a great deal of verse and (by licence of\r\nits title) a good deal of kissing; but is flatly told, despite not a\r\nlittle _Phébus_. It is a sort of combat of Spiritual and Fleshly Love;\r\nand Armonde ends as a kind of irregular anchorite, having previously\r\n\"spent several days in deliberating the cut of his vestments.\"\r\n\r\n_Les Caprices Héroïques_ (Paris, 1644) is a translation, by\r\nChateaunières de Grenaille, from the Italian of Loredano. It consists of\r\nvariations on classical stories, treated rather in the declamation\r\nmanner, and ranging in subject from Achilles to \"Friné.\" How many\r\nreaders (at least among those who read with their eyes only) will affirm\r\non their honour that they identified \"Friné\" at first reading? In\r\nItalian there would, of course, be less hesitation. The book is not\r\nprecisely a novel, but it has merits as a collection of rhetorical\r\nexercises. Of a somewhat similar kind, though even further from the\r\nstrict novel standard, is the _Diverses Affections de Minerve_ (Paris,\r\n1625) of the above-mentioned Audiguier, where the heroine is _not_ the\r\ngoddess, and all sorts of places and personages, mythological,\r\nclassical, historic, and modern, compose a miraculous _macédoine_,\r\nBrasidas jostling Gracchus, and Chabrias living in the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Martin. This _is_ a sort of story, but the greatest part of the\r\nvolume as it lies before me is composed of _Lettres Espagnoles_,\r\n_Epîtres Françaises_, _Libres Discours_, etc.\r\n\r\nWe can apparently return to the stricter romance, such as it is, with\r\nthe _Histoire Asiatique_ of the Sieur de Gerzan (Paris, 1633), but it is\r\nnoteworthy that the title-page of this ballasts itself by an \"Avec un\r\nTraité du Trésor de la Vie Humaine et La Philosophie des Dames.\" I\r\nconfess that, as in the case of most of the books here mentioned, I have\r\nnot read it with the care I bestowed on the _Cyrus_. But I perceive in\r\nit ladies who love corsairs, universal medicines, poodles who are\r\nsacrificed to save their owners, and other things which may tempt some.\r\nAnd I can, by at least sampling, rather recommend _Les Travaux du Prince\r\nInconnu_ (Paris, 1633) by the Sieur de Logeas. It calls itself, and its\r\n700 pages, the completion of two earlier performances, the _Roman\r\nHistorique_ and the _Histoire des Trois Frères Princes de\r\nConstantinople_, which have not come in my way. There is, however,\r\nprobably no cause to regret this, for the author assures us that his new\r\nwork is \"as far above the two former in beauty as the sun is above the\r\nstars.\" If any light-minded person be disposed to scoff at him for this,\r\nlet it be added that he has the grace to abstract the whole in the _Avis\r\nau Lecteur_ which contains the boast, and to give full chapter-headings,\r\nthings too often wanting in the group. The hero is named Rosidor, the\r\nheroine Floralinde; and they are married with \"la réjouissance générale\r\nde toute la Chrétienté.\" What can mortals ask for more?\r\n\r\n_Polémire ou l'Illustre Polonais_ (Paris, 1647), is dedicated to no less\r\na person than Madame de Montbazon, and contains much piety, a good deal\r\nof fighting, and some verse. _L'Amour Aventureux_ (Paris, 1623), by the\r\nnot unknown Du Verdier, is a book with _Histoires_, and I am not sure\r\nthat the volume I have seen contains the whole of it. _L'Empire de\r\nl'Inconstance_ (Paris, 1635), by the Sieur de Ville, and published \"at\r\nthe entry of the little gallery of Prisoners under the sign of the\r\nVermilion Roses,\" has a most admirable title to start with, and a table\r\nof over thirty _Histoires_, a dozen letters, and two \"amorous judgments\"\r\nat the end. _Les Fortunes Diverses de Chrysomire et de Kalinde_ (Paris,\r\n1635), by a certain Humbert, blazons \"love and war\" on its very\r\ntitle-page, while _Celandre_ (Paris, 1671), a much later book than most\r\nof these, has the rather uncommon feature of a single name for title.\r\nThirty or forty years ago I should have taken some pleasure in \"cooking\"\r\nthis batch of mostly early romances into a twenty-page article which,\r\nunless it had been unlucky, would have found its way into some magazine\r\nor review. Somebody might do so now. But I think it sufficient, and not\r\nsuperfluous, to add this brief sketch here to the notices of similar\r\nthings in the last volume, in order to show how abundant the crop of\r\nFrench romance--of which even these are only further samples--was at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nP. 231, l. 9 from bottom.--_Add_ 's (Herman sla lerman's).\r\n\r\nP. 237, _note_ 2, l. 1.--_For_ \"revision\" _read_ \"revisal.\"\r\n\r\nP. 241, 2nd par., last line but two.--_For_ \"But\" _read_ \"Still.\"\r\n\r\nP. 278, l. 7 from bottom.--Delete comma at \"Thackeray's.\"\r\n\r\nP. 286, l. 18.--It occurred to me (among the usual discoveries which one\r\nmakes in reading one's book after it has passed the irremeable press)\r\nthat I ought to have said \"Planchet's\" horse, not \"D'Artagnan's.\" True,\r\nas a kindly fellow-Alexandrian (who had not noticed the slip) consoled\r\nmy remorse by saying, the horse was D'Artagnan's _property_; but the\r\nphrase usually implies riding at the moment. And Aramis, brave as he\r\nwas, would have been sure to reflect that to play a feat of possibly\r\nhostile acrobatism on the Gascon, without notice, might be a little\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nP. 304, ll. 4 and 7.--Shift \"with his wife and mistress\" to l. 4,\r\nreading \"the relations with his wife and mistress of that Henri II.,\"\r\netc.\r\n\r\nP. 314, l. 12 from bottom.--_For_ \"usual\" _read_ \"common\" (common\r\nnorm.)\r\n\r\nP. 338, l. 21.--Delete \"in\" before \"among.\"\r\n\r\nP. 381.--One or two reviewers and some private correspondents have\r\nexpressed surprise at my not knowing, or at any rate not mentioning, the\r\nlate Professor Morley's publication of _Rasselas_ and a translation of\r\n_Candide_ together. I cannot say positively whether I knew of it or not,\r\nthough I must have done so, having often gone over the lists of that\r\neditor's numerous \"libraries\" to secure for my students texts not\r\noverlaid with commentary. But I can say very truthfully that no slight\r\nwhatever was intended, in regard to a scholar who did more than almost\r\nany other single man to \"vulgarise\" (in the wholly laudable sense of\r\nthat too often degraded word) the body of English literature. Only, such\r\na book would not have been what I was thinking of. To bring out the full\r\ncontrast-complement of these two strangely coincident masterpieces, both\r\nmust be read in the originals. Paradoxically, one might even say that a\r\nFrench translation of Johnson, with the original of Voltaire, would show\r\nit better than the converse presentment. _Candide_ is so intensely\r\nFrench--it is even to such an extent an embodiment of one side of\r\nFrenchness--that you cannot receive its virtues except through the\r\noriginal tongue. I am personally fond of translating; I have had some\r\npractice in it; and some good wits have not disapproved some of my\r\nefforts. But, unless I knew that in case of refusal I should be ranked\r\nas a Conscientious Objector, I would not attempt _Candide_. The French\r\nwould ring in my ears too reproachfully.\r\n\r\nP. 396, last line.--Shift comma from after to before \"even.\"\r\n\r\nP. 399, l. 10.--_For_ \"Rousseau\" _read_ \"his author.\"\r\n\r\nP. 424, _note_, first line.--Delete quotes before \"The.\"\r\n\r\nP. 453, l. 15.--_For_ \"Courray\" _read_ \"Cou_v_ray.\"\r\n\r\nP. 468, l. 17.--_For_ \"France has\" _read_ \"France had.\"\r\n\r\nP. 477.--In the original preface I apologised--not in the idle hope of\r\nconciliating one kind of critic, but out of respect for a very different\r\nclass--for slips due to the loss of my own library, and to the\r\ndifficulty (a difficulty which has now increased owing to circumstances\r\nof no public interest, in respect of the present volume) of consulting\r\nothers in regard to small matters of fact. I have very gratefully to\r\nacknowledge that I found the latter class very much larger than the\r\nformer. Such a note as that at Vol. I. p. xiii, will show that I have\r\nnot spared trouble to ensure accuracy. The charge of _in_accuracy can\r\nalways be made by anybody who cares to take \"the other authority.\" This\r\nhas been done in reference to the dates of Prévost's books. But I may\r\nperhaps say, without _outrecuidance_, that there is an _Art de négliger\r\nles dates_ as well as one _de les verifier_. For the purposes of such a\r\nhistory as this it is very rarely of the slightest importance, whether a\r\nbook was published in the year one or the year three: though the\r\nimportance of course increases when units pass into decades, and becomes\r\ngrave where decades pass into half-centuries. Unless you can collate\r\nactual first editions in every case (and sometimes even then) dates of\r\nbooks as given are always second-hand. In reference to the same subject\r\nI have also been rebuked for not taking account of M. Harrisse's\r\ncorrection of the legend of Prévost's death. As a matter of fact I knew\r\nbut had forgotten it, and it has not the slightest importance in\r\nconnection with Prévost's work. Besides, somebody will probably, sooner\r\nor later, correct M. Harrisse. These things pass: _Manon Lescaut_\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDENDA AND CORRIGENDA FOR VOL. II\r\n\r\n\r\nP. 65.--A reviewer of my first volume, who objected to my omission there\r\nof Madame de Charrières, may possibly think that omission made more\r\nsinful by the admission of Madame de Montolieu. But there seems to me to\r\nbe a sufficient distinction between the two cases. Isabella Agnes\r\nElizabeth Van Tuyll (or, as she liked to call herself, Belle de Zuylen),\r\nsubsequently Madame de Saint-Hyacinthe de Charrières (how mellifluously\r\nthese names pass over one's tongue!), was a very interesting person, and\r\nhighly characteristic of the later eighteenth century. I first met with\r\nher long ago (see Vol. I. p. 443) in my \"Sensibility\" researches, as\r\nhaving, in her maturer years, played that curious, but at the time not\r\nuncommon, part of \"Governess in erotics\" to Benjamin Constant, who was\r\nthen quite young, and with whose uncle, Constant d'Hermenches, she had,\r\nyears earlier and before her own marriage, carried on a long and very\r\nintimate but platonic correspondence. This is largely occupied with\r\noddly business-like discussions of marriage schemes for herself, one of\r\nthe _prétendants_ being no less a person than our own precious Bozzy,\r\nwho met her on the Continental tour for which Johnson started him at\r\nHarwich. But--and let this always be a warning to literary lovers--the\r\ntwo fell out over a translation of the Corsica book which she began.\r\nBoswell was not the wisest of men, especially where women were\r\nconcerned. But even he might have known that, if you trust the\r\nbluest-eyed of gazelles to do such things for you, she will probably\r\nmarry a market-gardener. (He seems also to have been a little afraid of\r\nher superiority of talent, _v._ his letters to Temple and his _Johnson_,\r\npp. 192-3, Globe Ed.)\r\n\r\nBesides these, and other genuine letters, she wrote not a few novels,\r\nconcocted often, if not always, in epistolary form. Their French was so\r\ngood that it attracted Sainte-Beuve's attention and praise, while quite\r\nrecently she has had a devoted panegyrist and editor in Switzerland,\r\nwhere, after her marriage, she was domiciled. But (and here come the\r\nreasons for the former exclusion) she learnt her French as a foreign\r\nlanguage. She was French neither by birth nor by extraction, nor, if I\r\ndo not mistake, by even temporary residence, though she did stay in\r\nEngland for a considerable time. Some of these points distinguish her\r\nfrom Hamilton as others do from Madame de Montolieu. If I put her in, I\r\ndo not quite see how I could leave Beckford out.\r\n\r\nP. 400, ll. 2, 3.--_For_ \"1859 ... 1858\" _read_ \"1857--a year, with its\r\nsuccessors 1858 and 1859,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\nMADAME DE STAËL AND CHATEAUBRIAND                                    1\r\n\r\nReasons for beginning with Mme. de Staël--_Delphine_--The\r\ntone--The story--_Corinne_--Its improved conditions--An\r\nillustrated edition of it--The story--The character of\r\nNelvil--And the book's absurdities--Compensations: Corinne\r\nherself--Nelvil again--Its aesthetics--The author's position\r\nin the History of the Novel--Chateaubriand: his peculiar\r\nposition as a novelist--And the remarkable interconnection\r\nof his works in fiction--_Atala_--_René_--Difference between\r\nits importance and its merit--_Les Natchez_--_Les\r\nMartyrs_--The story--Its \"panoramic\" quality--And its\r\nremarkable advance in style--Chateaubriand's Janus-position\r\nin this--Illustrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPAUL DE KOCK, OTHER MINORS OF 1800-1830, AND NODIER                 39\r\n\r\n The fate of popular minor novelists--Examples of\r\nthem--Paul de Kock--_L'Enfant de ma Femme_--_Petits Tableaux\r\nde Moeurs_--_Gustave_--The caricatured _Anglais_--_Edmond et\r\nsa Cousine_--_André le Savoyard_--_Jean_--_La Femme_, _le\r\nMari et l'Amant_--_Mon Voisin Raymond_--_Le Barbier de\r\nParis_--The Pauline grisette--Others--The minors before\r\n1830--Mme. de Montolieu: _Caroline de Lichtfield_--Its\r\nadvance on \"Sensibility\"--Madame de Genlis _iterum_--The\r\nminor popular novel--Ducray-Duminil: _Le Petit\r\nCarillonneur_--V.

And it is, to a large extent, true. But the loss of\r\nindividuality implies the presence of indiscernibility; and not to go\r\nout of our own department, there are at least three writers who, if but\r\npartially, cancel this entry to discredit. Of one of them--the lowest in\r\ngeneral literature, if not quite in our division of\r\nit--Pigault-Lebrun--we have spoken in the last volume. The other\r\ntwo--much less craftsmanlike novelists merely as such, but immeasurably\r\ngreater as man and woman of letters--remain for discussion in the first\r\nchapter of this. In pure chronological order Chateaubriand should come\r\nfirst, as well as in other \"ranks\" of various kinds. But History, though\r\nit may never neglect, may sometimes overrule Chronology by help of a\r\nlarger and higher point of view: sex and birth hardly count here, and\r\nthe departmental primes the intrinsic literary importance.\r\nChateaubriand, too, was a little younger than Madame de Staël in years,\r\nthough his actual publication, in anything like our kind, came before\r\nhers. And he reached much farther than she did, though curiously enough\r\nsome of his worst faults were more of the eighteenth century than hers.\r\nShe helped to finish \"Sensibility\"; she transformed \"Philosophism\" into\r\nsomething more modern; she borrowed a good deal (especially in the\r\nregion of aesthetics) that was to be importantly germinal from Germany.\r\nBut she had practically nothing of that sense of the past and of the\r\nstrange which was to rejuvenate all literature, and which he had; while\r\nshe died before the great French Romantic outburst began. So let us\r\nbegin with her.[8]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Delphine._]\r\n\r\n\"This dismal trash, which has nearly dislocated the jaws of every critic\r\nwho has read it,\" was the extremely rude judgment pronounced by Sydney\r\nSmith on Madame de Staël's _Delphine_. Sydney was a good-natured person\r\nand a gentleman, nor had he, merely as a Whig, any reason to quarrel\r\nwith the lady's general attitude to politics--a circumstance which, one\r\nregrets to say, did in those days, on both sides, rather improperly\r\nqualify the attitude of gentlemen to literary ladies as well as to each\r\nother. It is true that the author of _Corinne_ and of _Delphine_ itself\r\nhad been rather a thorn in the side of the English Whigs by dint of some\r\nof her opinions, by much of her conduct, and, above all, by certain\r\npeculiarities which may be noticed presently. But Sydney, though a Whig,\r\nwas not \"a _vile_ Whig,\" for which reason the Upper Powers, in his later\r\nyears, made him something rather indistinguishable from a Tory. And that\r\nblunt common sense, which in his case cohabited with the finest\r\n_un_common wit, must have found itself, in this instance, by no means\r\nat variance with its housemate in respect of Anne Germaine Necker.\r\n\r\nThere are many _worse_ books than _Delphine_. It is excellently written;\r\nthere is no bad blood in it; there is no intentional licentiousness; on\r\nthe contrary, there are the most desperate attempts to live up to a New\r\nMorality by no means entirely of the Wiggins kind. But there is an\r\nabsence of humour which is perfectly devastating: and there is a\r\npresence of the most disastrous atmosphere of sham sentiment, sham\r\nmorality, sham almost everything, that can be imagined. It was hinted in\r\nthe last volume that Madame de Staël's lover, Benjamin Constant, shows\r\nin one way the Nemesis of Sensibility; so does she herself in another.\r\nBut the difference! In _Adolphe_ a coal from the altar of true passion\r\nhas touched lips in themselves polluted enough, and the result is what\r\nit always is in such, alas! rare cases, whether the lips were polluted\r\nor not. In _Delphine_ there is a desperate pother to strike some sort of\r\nlight and get some sort of heat; but the steel is naught, the flint is\r\nclay, the tinder is mouldy, and the wood is damp and rotten. No glow of\r\nbrand or charcoal follows, and the lips, untouched by it, utter nothing\r\nbut rhetoric and fustian and, as the Sydneian sentence speaks it,\r\n\"trash.\"[9]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The tone.]\r\n\r\nIn fact, to get any appropriate metaphorical description of it one has\r\nto change the terminology altogether. In a very great line Mr. Kipling\r\nhas spoken of a metaphorical ship--\r\n\r\n    With a drogue of dead convictions to keep her head to gale.\r\n\r\nMadame de Staël has cast off not only that drogue, but even the other\r\nand perhaps commoner floating ballast and steadier of dead\r\n_conventions_, and is trying to beat up against the gale by help of all\r\nsorts of jury-masts and extemporised try-sails of other new conventions\r\nthat are mostly blowing out of the bolt-ropes. We said that Crébillon's\r\nworld was an artificial one, and one of not very respectable artifice.\r\nBut it worked after a fashion; it was founded on some real, however\r\nunrespectable, facts of humanity; and it was at least amusing to the\r\nnaughty players on its stage to begin with, and long afterwards to the\r\nguiltless spectators of the commonty. In _Delphine_ there is not a\r\nglimmer of amusement from first to last, and the whole story is compact\r\n(if that word were not totally inapplicable) of windbags of sentiment,\r\ncopy-book headings, and the strangest husks of neo-classic type-worship,\r\nstock character, and hollow generalisation. An Italian is necessarily a\r\nperson of volcanic passions; an Englishman or an American (at this time\r\nthe identification was particularly unlucky) has, of equal necessity, a\r\ngrave and reserved physiognomy. Orthodox religion is a mistake, but a\r\nkind of moral-philosophical Deism (something of the Wolmar type) is\r\nhighly extolled. You must be technically \"virtuous\" yourself, even if\r\nyou bring a whole second volume of tedious tortures on you by being so;\r\nbut you may play Lady Pandara to a friend who is a devout adulteress,\r\nmay force yourself into her husband's carriage when he is carrying her\r\noff from one assignation, and may bring about his death by contriving\r\nanother in your own house. In fact, the whole thing is topsy-turvy,\r\nwithout the slightest touch of that animation and interested curiosity\r\nwhich topsy-turviness sometimes contributes. But perhaps one should give\r\na more regular account of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The story.]\r\n\r\nDelphine d'Albémar is a young, beautiful, rich, clever, generous, and,\r\nin the special and fashionable sense, extravagantly \"sensible\" widow,\r\nwho opens the story (it is in the troublesome epistolary form) by\r\nhanding over about a third of her fortune to render possible the\r\nmarriage of a cousin of her deceased husband. This cousin, Matilde de\r\nVernon, is also beautiful and accomplished, but a _dévote_, altogether\r\nwell-regulated and well-conducted, and (though it turns out that she has\r\nstrong and permanent affections) the reverse of \"sensible\"--in fact\r\nrather hard and disagreeable--in manner. She has a scheming mother, who\r\nhas run herself deeply, though privately, into debt, and the intended\r\nhusband and son-in-law, Léonce de Mandeville, also has a mother, who is\r\nhalf Spanish by blood and residence, and wholly so (according to the\r\ntype-theory above glanced at) in family pride, personal _morgue_, and so\r\nforth. A good deal of this has descended to her son, with whom, in spite\r\nor because of it, Delphine (she has not seen him before her rash\r\ngenerosity) proceeds to fall frantically in love, as he does with her.\r\nThe marriage, however, partly by trickery on Madame de Vernon's part,\r\nand partly owing to Delphine's more than indiscreet furthering of her\r\nfriend Madame d'Ervin's intrigue with the Italian M. de Serbellane, does\r\ntake place, and Mme. de Staël's idea of a nice heroine makes her station\r\nDelphine in a white veil, behind a pillar of the church, muttering\r\nreproaches at the bridegroom. No open family rupture, however, is\r\ncaused; on the contrary, a remarkable and inevitably disastrous \"triple\r\narrangement\" follows (as mentioned above), for an entire volume, in\r\nwhich the widow and the bridegroom make despairing love to each other,\r\nrefraining, however, from any impropriety, and the wife, though\r\nsuffering (for she, in her apparently frigid way, really loves her\r\nhusband), tolerates the proceeding after a fashion. This impossible and\r\npreposterous situation is at last broken up by the passion and violence\r\nof another admirer of Delphine--a certain M. de Valorbe. These bring\r\nabout duels, wounds, and Delphine's flight to Switzerland, where she\r\nputs up in a convent with a most superfluous and in every way\r\nunrefreshing new personage, a widowed sister of Madame de Mandeville.\r\nValorbe follows, and, to get hold of Delphine, machinates one of the\r\nmost absurd scenes in the whole realm of fiction. He lures her into\r\nAustrian territory and a chamber with himself alone, locks the door and\r\nthrows the key out of the window,[10] storms, rants, threatens, but\r\nproceeds to no _voie de fait_, and merely gets himself and the object of\r\nhis desires arrested by the Austrians! He thus succeeds, while procuring\r\nno gratification for himself, in entirely demolishing the last shred of\r\nreputation which, virtuous as she is in her own way, Delphine's various\r\neccentricities and escapades have left her; and she takes the veil. In\r\nthe first form the authoress crowned this mass of absurdities with the\r\nsuicide of the heroine and the judicial shooting of the hero. Somebody\r\nremonstrated, and she made Delphine throw off her vows, engage herself\r\nto Léonce (whose unhappy wife has died from too much carrying out of the\r\nduty of a mother to her child), and go with him to his estates in La\r\nVendée, where he is to take up arms for the king. Unfortunately, the\r\nVendéans by no means \"see\" their _seigneur_ marrying an apostate nun,\r\nand strong language is used. So Delphine dies, not actually by her own\r\nhand, and Léonce gets shot, more honourably than he deserves, on the\r\npatriot-royalist side.\r\n\r\nAmong the minor characters not yet referred to are an old-maid\r\nsister-in-law of Delphine's, who, though tolerably sensible in the\r\nbetter sense, plays the part of confidante to her brother's _mijaurée_\r\nof a widow much too indulgently; a M. Barton, Léonce's mentor, who,\r\ndespite his English-looking name, is not (one is glad to find) English,\r\nbut is, to one's sorrow, one of the detestable \"parsons-in-tie-wigs\"\r\nwhom French Anglomania at this time foisted on us as characteristic of\r\nEngland; a sort of double of his, M. de Lerensei, a Protestant\r\nfree-thinker, who, with his _divorcée_ wife, puts up grass altars in\r\ntheir garden with inscriptions recording the happiness of their queer\r\nunion; an ill-natured Mme. du Marset and her old cicisbeo, M. de\r\nFierville, who suggest, in the dismallest way, the weakest wine of\r\nMarmontel gone stale and filtered through the dullest, though not the\r\ndirtiest, part of Laclos.\r\n\r\nYet the thing, \"dismal trash\" as Sydney almost justly called it, is\r\nperhaps worth reading once (nothing but the sternest voice of duty\r\ncould have made me read it twice) because of the existence of _Corinne_,\r\nand because also of the undoubted fact that, here as there, though much\r\nmore surprisingly, a woman of unusual ability was drawing a picture of\r\nwhat she would have liked to be--if not of what she actually thought\r\nherself.[11] The borrowed beauty goes for nothing--it were indeed hard\r\nif one did not, in the case of a woman of letters, \"let her make her\r\ndream All that she would,\" like Tennyson's Prince, but in this other\r\nrespect. The generosity, less actually exaggerated, might also pass.\r\nThat Delphine makes a frantic fool of herself for a lover whose\r\nattractions can only make male readers shrug their shoulders--for though\r\nwe are _told_ that Léonce is clever, brave, charming, and what not, we\r\nsee nothing of it in speech or action--may be matter of taste; but that\r\nher heroine's part should seem to any woman one worth playing is indeed\r\nwonderful. Delphine behaves throughout like a child, and by no means\r\nalways like a very well-brought-up child; she never seems to have the\r\nvery slightest idea that \"things are as they are and that their\r\nconsequences will be what they will be\"; and though, once more, we are\r\n_told_ of passion carrying all before it, we are never _shown_ it. It is\r\nall \"words, words.\" To speak of her love in the same breath with Julie's\r\nis to break off the speech in laughter; to consider her woes and\r\nremember Clarissa's is to be ready to read another seven or eight\r\nvolumes of Richardson in lieu of these three of Madame de Staël's.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this lady could do something in the novel way, and, when the\r\ntime came, she did it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Corinne._]\r\n\r\nBetween _Delphine_ and _Corinne_ Madame de Staël had, in the fullest\r\nsense of a banal phrase, \"seen a great of the world.\" She had lost the\r\nillusions which the Duessa Revolution usually spreads among clever but\r\nnot wise persons at her first appearance, and had not left her bones,\r\nas too many[12] such persons do, in the _pieuvre_-caves which the\r\nmonster keeps ready. She had seen England, being \"coached\" by\r\nCrabb-Robinson and others, so as to give some substance to the vague\r\n_philosophe-Anglomane_ flimsiness of her earlier fancy. She had seen\r\nRepublicanism turn to actual Tyranny, and had made exceedingly\r\nunsuccessful attempts to captivate the tyrant. She had seen Germany, and\r\nhad got something of its then not by any means poisonous, if somewhat\r\nwindy, \"culture\"; a little romance of a kind, though she was never a\r\nreal Romantic; some aesthetics; some very exoteric philosophy, etc. She\r\nhad done a great deal of not very happy love-making; had been a woman of\r\nletters, a patroness of men of letters, and--most important of all--had\r\nnever dismounted from her old hobby \"Sensibility,\" though she had learnt\r\nhow to put it through new paces.\r\n\r\nA critical reader of _Corinne_ must remember all this, and he must\r\nremember something else, though the reminder has been thought to savour\r\nof brutality. It is perfectly clear to me, and always has been so from\r\nreading (in and between the lines) of her own works, of Lady\r\nBlennerhassett's monumental book on her, of M. Sorel's excellent\r\nmonograph, and of scores of longer and shorter studies on and references\r\nto her English and German and Swiss and French--from her own time\r\ndownwards, that the central secret, mainspring, or whatever any one may\r\nchoose to call it, of Madame de Staël's life was a frantic desire for\r\nthe physical beauty which she did not possess,[13] and a persistent\r\nattempt, occasionally successful, to delude herself into believing that\r\nshe had achieved a sufficient substitute by literary, philosophical,\r\npolitical, and other exertion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its improved conditions.]\r\n\r\nThis partly pathetic, partly, alas! ridiculous, but on the whole (with a\r\nlittle charity) quite commiserable endeavour, attained some success,\r\nthough probably with not a little extraneous help, in _De l'Allemagne_,\r\nand the posthumous _Considérations_ on the Revolution; but these books\r\ndo not concern us, and illustrate only part of the writer's character,\r\ntemperament, and talent, if not genius. _Corinne_ gives us the rest, and\r\nnearly, if not quite, the whole. The author had no doubt tried to do\r\nthis in _Delphine_, but had then had neither art nor equipment for the\r\ntask, and she had failed utterly. She was now well, if not perfectly,\r\nequipped, and had learnt not a little of the art to use her\r\nacquisitions. _Delphine_ had been dull, absurd, preposterous; _Corinne_,\r\nif it has dull patches, saves them from being intolerable. If its\r\nsentiment is extravagant, it is never exactly preposterous or exactly\r\nabsurd; for the truth and reality of passion which are absent from the\r\nother book are actually present here, though sometimes in unintentional\r\nmasquerade.\r\n\r\nIn fact, _Corinne_, though the sisterhood of the two books is obvious\r\nenough, has almost, though not quite, all the faults of _Delphine_\r\nremoved and some merits added, of which in the earlier novel there is\r\nnot the slightest trace. The history of my own acquaintance with it is,\r\nI hope, not quite irrelevant. I read it--a very rare thing for me with a\r\nFrench novel (in fact I can hardly recollect another instance, except, a\r\nquaint contrast, Paul de Kock's _André le Savoyard_)--first in English,\r\nand at a very early period of life, and I then thought it nearly as\r\ngreat \"rot\" as I have always thought its predecessor. But though I had,\r\nI hope, sense enough to see its faults, I had neither age nor experience\r\nnor literature enough to appreciate its merits. I read it a good deal\r\nlater in French, and, being then better qualified, _did_ perceive these\r\nmerits, though it still did not greatly \"arride\" me. Later still--in\r\nfact, only some twenty years ago--I was asked to re-edit and \"introduce\"\r\nthe English translation. It is a popular mistake to think that an\r\neditor, like an advocate, is entitled, if not actually bound, to make\r\nthe best case for his client, quite apart from his actual opinions; but\r\nin this instance my opinion of the book mounted considerably. And it has\r\ncertainly not declined since, though this _History_ has necessitated a\r\nfourth study of the original, and though I shall neither repeat what I\r\nsaid in the Introduction referred to, nor give the impression there\r\nrecorded in merely altered words. Indeed, the very purpose of the\r\npresent notice, forming part, as it should, of a connected history of\r\nthe whole department to which the book belongs, requires different\r\ntreatment, and an application of what may be called critical\r\n\"triangulation\" from different stand-points.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An illustrated edition of it.]\r\n\r\nBy an odd chance and counter-chance, the edition which served for this\r\nlast perusal, after threatening to disserve its text, had an exactly\r\ncontrary result. It was the handsome two-volume issue of 1841 copiously\r\nadorned with all sorts of ingenious initial-devices, _culs-de-lampe_,\r\netc., and with numerous illustrative \"cuts\" beautifully engraved (for\r\nthe most part by English engravers, such as Orrin Smith, the Williamses,\r\netc.), excellently drawn and composed by French artists from Gros\r\ndownwards, but costumed in what is now perhaps the least tolerable style\r\nof dress even to the most catholic taste--that of the Empire in France\r\nand the Regency in England--and most comically \"thought.\"[14] At first\r\nsight this might seem to be a disadvantage, as calling attention to, and\r\naggravating, certain defects of the text itself. I found it just the\r\nreverse. One was slightly distracted from, and half inclined to make\r\nallowances for, Nelvil's performances in the novel when one saw him--in\r\na Tom-and-Jerry early chimneypot hat, a large coachman's coat flung off\r\nhis shoulders and hanging down to his heels, a swallow-tail, tight\r\npantaloons, and Hessian boots--extracting from his bosom his father's\r\nportrait and expressing filial sentiments to it. One was less likely to\r\naccuse Corinne of peevishness when one beheld the delineation of family\r\nworship in the Edgermond household from which she fled. And the\r\nfaithful eyes remonstrated with the petulant brain for scoffing at\r\nexcessive sentiment, when they saw how everybody was always at somebody\r\nelse's feet, or supporting somebody else in a fainting condition, or\r\nresting his or her burning brow on a hand, the elbow of which rested, in\r\nits turn, on a pedestal like that of Mr. Poseidon Hicks in _Mrs.\r\nPerkins's Ball_. The plates gave a safety-valve to the letterpress in a\r\ncuriously anodyne fashion which I hardly ever remember to have\r\nexperienced before. Or rather, one transferred to them part, if not the\r\nwhole, of the somewhat contemptuous amusement which the manners had\r\nexcited, and had one's more appreciative faculties clear for the book\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The story.]\r\n\r\nThe story of _Corinne_, though not extraordinarily \"accidented\" and, as\r\nwill be seen, adulterated, or at least mixed, with a good many things\r\nthat are not story at all, is fairly solid, much more so than that of\r\n_Delphine_. It turns--though the reader is not definitely informed of\r\nthis till the book is half over--on the fact of an English nobleman,\r\nLord Edgermond (dead at _temp._ of tale), having had two wives, the\r\nfirst an Italian. By her he had one daughter, whose actual Christian\r\nname (unless I forget) we are never told, and he lived with them in\r\nItaly till his wife's death. Then he went home and married a second\r\nwife, an English or Scotch woman (for her name seems to have been\r\nMaclinson--a well-known clan) of very prudish disposition. By her he had\r\nanother daughter, Lucile--younger by a good many years than her sister.\r\nTo that sister Lady Edgermond the second does not behave exactly in the\r\ntraditionally novercal fashion, but she is scandalised by the girl's\r\nItalian ways, artistic and literary temperament, desire for society,\r\netc. After Lord Edgermond's death the discord of the two becomes\r\nintolerable, and the elder Miss Edgermond, coming of age and into an\r\nindependent fortune, breaks loose and returns to Italy, her stepmother\r\nstipulating that she shall drop her family name altogether and allow\r\nherself to be given out as dead. She consents (unwisely, but perhaps\r\nnot unnaturally), appears in Italy under the name of \"Corinne,\" and\r\nestablishes herself without difficulty in the best Roman society as a\r\nlady of means, great beauty, irreproachable character, but given to\r\nprivate displays of her talents as singer, improvisatrice, actress, and\r\nwhat not.\r\n\r\nBut before she has thus thrown a still respectable bonnet over a not too\r\ndisreputable mill, something has happened which has, in the long run,\r\nfatal consequences. Lord Edgermond has a friend, Lord Nelvil, who has a\r\nson rather younger than Corinne. Both fathers think that a marriage\r\nwould be a good thing, and the elder Nelvil comes to stay with the\r\nEdgermonds to propose it. Corinne (or whatever her name was then) lays\r\nherself out in a perfectly innocent but, as he thinks, forward manner to\r\nplease him, and he, being apparently (we never see him in person) not a\r\nlittle of an old fool, cries off this project, but tells Edgermond that\r\nhe should like his son to marry Lucile when she grows up.\r\n\r\nWithout an intolerable dose of \"argument,\" it is only possible to say\r\nhere that Nelvil, after his father's death, journeys to the Continent\r\n(where he has been already engaged in a questionable _liaison_), meets\r\nCorinne, and, not at first knowing in the least who she is, falls, or\r\nthinks he falls, frantically in love with her, while she really does\r\nfall more frantically in love with him. After a sojourn, of which a\r\nlittle more presently, circumstances make him (or he thinks they make\r\nhim) return home, and he falls, or thinks he falls,[15] out of love with\r\nCorinne and into it (after a fashion) with Lucile. Corinne undertakes an\r\nincognito journey to England to find out what is happening, but (this,\r\nthough not impossible in itself, is, as told, the weakest part of the\r\nstory) never makes herself known till too late, and Nelvil, partly out\r\nof respect for his father's wishes, and partly, one fears, because\r\nLucile is very pretty and Corinne seems to be very far off, marries the\r\nyounger sister.\r\n\r\nIt would have greatly improved the book if, with or even without a\r\n\"curtain,\" it had ended here. But Madame de Staël goes on to tell us how\r\nNelvil, who is a soldier by profession,[16] leaves his wife and a little\r\ndaughter, Juliette, and goes to \"Les Iles\" on active service for four\r\nyears; how Lucile, not unnaturally, suspects hankering after the sister\r\nshe has not seen since her childhood; how, Nelvil being invalided home,\r\nthey all go to Italy, and find Corinne in a dying condition; how Lucile\r\nat first refuses to see her, but, communications being opened by the\r\nchild Juliette, reconciliations follow; and how Corinne dies with Nelvil\r\nand Lucile duly kneeling at her bedside.\r\n\r\nThe minor personages of any importance are not numerous. Besides Lady\r\nEdgermond, they consist of the Comte d'Erfeuil, a French travelling\r\ncompanion of Nelvil's; the Prince of Castel-Forte, an Italian of the\r\nhighest rank; a Mr. Edgermond, who does not make much appearance, but is\r\nmore like a real Englishman in his ways and manners than Nelvil; an old\r\nScotch nincompoop named Dickson, who, unintentionally, makes mischief\r\nwherever he goes as surely as the personage in the song made music. Lady\r\nEdgermond, though she is neither bad nor exactly ill-natured, is the\r\nevil genius of the story. Castel-Forte, a most honourable and excellent\r\ngentleman, has so little of typical Italianism in him that, finding\r\nCorinne will not have him, he actually serves as common friend,\r\nconfidant, and almost as honourable go-between, to her and Nelvil.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, French critics have justly complained, and critics\r\nnot French may endorse the complaint, that the Comte d'Erfeuil is a mere\r\ncaricature of the \"frivolous\" French type too commonly accepted out of\r\nFrance. He is well-mannered, not ill-natured, and even not, personally,\r\nvery conceited, but utterly shallow, incapable of a serious interest in\r\nart, letters, or anything else, blandly convinced that everything French\r\nis superlative and that nothing not French is worthy of attention.\r\nAlthough he appears rather frequently, he plays no real part in the\r\nstory, and, unless there was some personal grudge to pay off (which is\r\nnot unlikely), it is difficult to imagine why Madame de Staël should\r\nhave introduced a character which certainly does her skill as a\r\ncharacter-drawer very little credit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The character of Nelvil.]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, quite possible that she was led astray by a\r\nwill-o'-the-wisp, which has often misled artists not of the very first\r\nclass--the chance of an easy contrast. The light-hearted, light-minded\r\nErfeuil was to set off the tense and serious Nelvil--a type again, as he\r\nwas evidently intended to be, but a somewhat new type of Englishman. She\r\nwas a devotee of Rousseau, and she undoubtedly had the egregious Bomston\r\nbefore her. But, though her sojourn in England had not taught her very\r\nmuch about actual Englishman, she had probably read Mackenzie, and knew\r\nthat the \"Man of Feeling\" touch had to some extent affected us. She\r\ntried to combine the two, with divers hints of hearsay and a good deal\r\nof pure fancy, and the result was Oswald, Lord Nelvil. As with that\r\nother curious contemporary of hers with whom we deal in this chapter,\r\nthe result was startlingly powerful in literature. There is no doubt\r\nthat the Byronic hero, whose importance of a kind is unmistakable and\r\nundeniable, is Schedoni, René, and Nelvil sliced up, pounded in a\r\nmortar, and made into a rissole with Byron's own sauce of style in\r\nrhetoric or (if anybody will have it so) poetry, but with very little\r\nmore substantial ingredients. As for the worthy peer of Scotland or\r\nEngland, more recent estimates have seldom been favourable, and never\r\nought to have been so. M. Sorel calls him a \"snob\"; but that is only one\r\nof the numerous and, according to amiable judgments, creditable\r\ninstances of the inability of the French to discern exactly what\r\n\"snobbishness\" is.[17] My Lord Nelvil has many faults and very few\r\nmerits, but among the former I do not perceive any snobbishness. He is\r\nnot in the least attracted by Corinne's popularity, either with the\r\ngreat vulgar or the small, and his hesitations about marrying her do not\r\narise from any doubt (while he is still ignorant on the subject) of her\r\nsocial worthiness to be his wife. He _is_ a prig doubtless, but he is a\r\nprig of a very peculiar character--a sort of passionate prig, or, to put\r\nit in another way, one of Baudelaire's \"Enfants de la lune,\" who, not\r\ncontent with always pining after the place where he is not and the love\r\nthat he has not, is constantly making not merely himself, but the place\r\nwhere he is and the love whom he has, uncomfortable and miserable. There\r\ncan, I think, be little doubt that Madame de Staël, who frequently\r\ninsists on his \"irresolution\" (remember that she had been in Germany and\r\nheard the Weimar people talk), meant him for a sort of modern Hamlet in\r\nvery different circumstances as well as times. But it takes your\r\nShakespeare to manage your Hamlet, and Madame de Staël was not\r\nShakespeare, even in petticoats.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And the book's absurdities.]\r\n\r\nThe absurdities of the book are sufficiently numerous. Lord Nelvil, who\r\nhas not apparently had any special experience of the sea, \"advises\" the\r\nsailors, and takes the helm during a storm on his passage from Harwich\r\nto Emden; while these English mariners, unworthy professional\r\ndescendants of that admirable man, the boatswain of the opening scenes\r\nof _The Tempest_, are actually grateful to him, and when he goes 'ashore\r\n\"press themselves round him\" to take leave of him (that is to say, they\r\ndo this in the book; what in all probability they actually _said_ would\r\nnot be fit for these pages). He is always saving people--imprisoned\r\nJews and lunatics at a fire in Ancona; aged lazzaroni who get\r\ncaught in a sudden storm-wave at Naples; and this in spite of the\r\nconvenient-inconvenient blood-vessels which break when it is necessary,\r\nbut still make it quite easy for him to perform these Herculean feats\r\nand resume his rather interim military duties when he pleases. As for\r\nCorinne, her exploits with her \"schall\" (a vestment of which Madame de\r\nStaël also was fond), and her crowning in the Capitol, where the crown\r\ntumbles off--an incident which in real life would be slightly comical,\r\nbut which here only gives Nelvil an opportunity of picking it up--form a\r\nsimilar prelude to a long series of extravagances. The culmination of\r\nthem is that altogether possible-improbable visit to England, which\r\nmight have put everything right and does put everything wrong, and the\r\nincurable staginess which makes her, as above related, refuse to see\r\nOswald and Lucile _together_ till she is actually in _articulo mortis_.\r\n\r\nAnd yet--\"for all this and all this and twice as much as all this\"--I\r\nshould be sorry for any one who regards Corinne as merely a tedious and\r\nnot at all brief subject for laughter. One solid claim which it\r\npossesses has been, and is still for a moment, definitely postponed; but\r\nin another point there is, if not exactly a defence, an immense\r\ncounterpoise to the faults and follies just mentioned. Corinne to far\r\ntoo great an extent, and Oswald to an extent nearly but not quite fatal,\r\nare loaded (_affublés_, to use the word we borrowed formerly) with a\r\nmass of corporal and spiritual wiglomeration (as Mr. Carlyle used\r\nexpressively and succinctly to call it) in costume and fashion and\r\nsentiment and action and speech. But when we have stripped this off,\r\n_manet res_--reality of truth and fact and nature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Compensations--Corinne herself.]\r\n\r\nThere should be no doubt of this in Corinne's own case. It has been said\r\nfrom the very first that she is, as Delphine had been, if not what her\r\ncreatress was, what she would have liked to be. The ideal in the former\r\ncase was more than questionable, and the execution was very bad. Here\r\nthe ideal is far from flawless, but it is greatly improved, and the\r\nexecution is improved far more than in proportion. Corinne is not \"a\r\nreasonable woman\"; but reason, though very heartily to be welcomed on\r\nits rare occurrences in that division of humanity, when it does not\r\nexclude other things more to be welcomed still, is very decidedly not to\r\nbe preferred to the other things themselves. Corinne has these--or most\r\nof them. She is beautiful; she is amiable; she is unselfish; without the\r\nslightest touch of prudery she has the true as well as the technical\r\nchastity; and she is really the victim of inauspicious stars, and of the\r\nmisconduct of other people--the questionable wisdom of her own father;\r\nthe folly of Nelvil's; the wilfulness in the bad sense, and the weakness\r\nof will in the good, of her lover; the sour virtue and _borné_\r\ntemperament of Lady Edgermond. Almost all her faults and not a few of\r\nher misfortunes are due to the \"sensibility\" of her time, or the time a\r\nlittle before her; for, as has been more than hinted already, _Corinne_,\r\nthough a book of far less genius, strength, and concentration than\r\n_Adolphe_, is, like it, though from the other side, and on a far larger\r\nscale, the history of the Nemesis of Sensibility.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nelvil again.]\r\n\r\nBut Nelvil? He is, it has been said, a deplorable kind of creature--a\r\nkind of creature (to vary Dr. Johnson's doom on the unlucky mutton)\r\nill-_bred_, ill-educated, ill- (though not quite in the ordinary sense)\r\nnatured, ill-fated to an extent which he could partly, but only partly,\r\nhave helped; and ill-conducted to an extent which he might have helped\r\nalmost altogether. But is he unnatural? I fear--I trow--not. He is, I\r\nthink, rather more natural than Edgar of Ravenswood, who is something of\r\nthe same class, and who may perhaps owe a very little to him. At any\r\nrate, though he has more to do with the theatre, he is less purely\r\ntheatrical than that black-plumed Master. And it seems to me that he is\r\nmore differentiated from the Sensibility heroes than even Corinne\r\nherself is from the Sensibility heroines, though one sympathises with\r\nher much more than with him. _Homo est_, though scarcely _vir_. Now it\r\nis humanity which we have been always seeking, but not always finding,\r\nin the long and often brilliant list of French novels before his day.\r\nAnd we have found it here once more.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its aesthetics.]\r\n\r\nBut we find also something more; and this something more gives it not\r\nmerely an additional but even to some extent a fresh hold upon the\r\nhistory of the novel itself. To say that it is in great part a\r\n\"guide-book novel,\" as indeed its second title[18] honestly declares,\r\nmay seem nowadays a doubtful testimonial. It is not really so. For it\r\nwas, with certain exceptions in German, the _first_ \"guide-book\" novel:\r\nand though some of those exceptions may have shown greater 'literary\r\ngenius than Madame de Staël's, the Germans, though they have, in certain\r\nlines, had no superiors as producers of tales, have never produced a\r\ngood novel yet.[19] Moreover, the guide-book element is a great set-off\r\nto the novel. It is not--or at any rate it is not necessarily--liable to\r\nthe objections to \"purpose,\" for it is ornamental and not structural. It\r\ntakes a new and important and almost illimitably fresh province of\r\nnature and of art, which is a part of nature, to be its appanage. It\r\nwould be out of place here to trace the development of this system of\r\nreinforcing the novel beyond France, in Scott more particularly. It is\r\nnot out of place to remind the reader that even Rousseau (to whom Madame\r\nde Staël owed so much) to some extent, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre and\r\nChateaubriand to more, as far as what we may call scenery-guide-booking\r\ngoes, had preceded her. But for the \"art,\" the aesthetic addition, she\r\nwas indebted only to the Germans; and almost all her French successors\r\nwere indebted to her.[20]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The author's position in the History of the Novel.]\r\n\r\nAlthough, therefore, it is hardly possible to call Madame de Staël a\r\ngood novelist, she occupies a very important position in the history of\r\nthe novel. She sees, or helps to see, the \"sensibility\" novel out, with\r\nforcible demonstration of the inconveniences of its theory. She helps to\r\nsee the aesthetic novel--or the novel highly seasoned and even\r\nsandwiched with aesthetics--in. She manages to create at least one\r\ncharacter to whom the epithets of \"noble\" and \"pathetic\" can hardly be\r\nrefused; and at least one other to which that of \"only too natural,\" if\r\nwith an exceptional and faulty kind of nature, must be accorded. At a\r\ntime when the most popular, prolific, and in a way craftsmanlike\r\npractitioner of the kind, Pigault-Lebrun, was dragging it through\r\nvulgarity, she keeps it at any rate clear of that. Her description is\r\nadequate: and her society-and-manners painting (not least in the _récit_\r\ngiving Corinne's trials in Northumberland) is a good deal more than\r\nadequate. Moreover, she preserves the tradition of the great\r\n_philosophe_ group by showing that the writer of novels can also be the\r\nauthor of serious and valuable literature of another kind. These are no\r\nsmall things to have done: and when one thinks of them one is almost\r\nable to wipe off the slate of memory that awful picture of a turbaned or\r\n\"schalled\" Blowsalind, with arms[21] like a \"daughter of the plough,\"\r\nwhich a cruel tradition has perpetuated as frontispiece to some cheap\r\neditions of her works.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chateaubriand--his peculiar position as a novelist.]\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no more difficult person to appraise in all French\r\nliterature--there are not many in the literature of the world--than\r\nFrançois René, Vicomte de Chateaubriand. It is almost more difficult\r\nthan in the case of his two great disciples, Byron and Hugo, to keep his\r\npersonality out of the record: and it is a not wholly agreeable\r\npersonality. Old experience may perhaps attain to this, and leave to\r\nghouls and large or small coffin-worms the business of investigating and\r\npossibly fattening on the thing. But even the oldest experience dealing\r\nwith his novels (which were practically all early) may find itself\r\nconsiderably _tabusté_, as Rabelais has it, that is to say, \"bothered\"\r\nwith faults which are mitigated in the _Génie du Christianisme_,\r\ncomparatively (not quite) unimportant in the _Voyages_, and almost\r\nentirely whelmed in the _Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe_. These faults are of\r\nsuch a complicated and various kind that the whole armour of criticism\r\nis necessary to deal with them, on the defensive in the sense of not\r\nbeing too much influenced by them, and on the offensive in the sense of\r\nbeing severe but not too severe on them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And the remarkable interconnection of his works in fiction.]\r\n\r\nThe mere reader of Chateaubriand's novels generally begins with _Atala_\r\nand _René_, and not uncommonly stops there. In a certain sense this\r\nreader is wise in his generation. But he will never understand his\r\nauthor as a novelist if he does so; and his appreciation of the books or\r\nbooklets themselves will be very incomplete. They are both not\r\nunfrequently spoken of as detached episodes of the _Génie du\r\nChristianisme_; and so they are, in the illustrative sense. They are\r\nactually, and in the purely constitutive way, episodes of another book,\r\n_Les Natchez_, while this book itself is also a novel \"after a sort.\"\r\nThe author's work in the kind is completed by the later _Les Martyrs_,\r\nwhich has nothing to do, in persons or time, with the others, being\r\noccupied with the end of the third century, while they deal (throwing\r\nback a little in _Atala_) with the beginning of the eighteenth. But this\r\nalso is an illustrative companion or reinforcement of the _Génie_. With\r\nthat book the whole body of Chateaubriand's fiction[22] is thus directly\r\nconnected; and the entire collection, not a little supported by the\r\n_Voyages_, constitutes a deliberate \"literary offensive,\" intended to\r\ncounter-work the proceedings of the _philosophes_, though with aid drawn\r\nfrom one of them--Rousseau,--and only secondarily designed to provide\r\npure novel-interest. If this is forgotten, the student will find himself\r\nat sea without a rudder; and the mere reader will be in danger of\r\nexaggerating very greatly, because he does not in the least understand,\r\nthe faults just referred to, and of failing altogether to appreciate the\r\nreal success and merit of the work as judged on that only criterion,\r\n\"Has the author done what he meant to do, and done it well, on the lines\r\nhe chose?\" Of course, if our reader says, \"I don't care about all this,\r\nI merely want to be amused and interested,\" one cannot prevent him. He\r\nhad, in fact, as was hinted just now, better read nothing but _Atala_\r\nand _René_, if not, indeed, _Atala_ only, immense as is the literary\r\nimportance of its companion. But in a history of the novel one is\r\nentitled to hope, at any rate to wish, for a somewhat better kind of\r\ncustomer or client.\r\n\r\nAccording to Chateaubriand's own account, when he quitted England after\r\nhis not altogether cheerful experiences there as an almost penniless\r\n_émigré_, he left behind him, in the charge of his landlady, exactly\r\n2383 folio pages of MSS. enclosed in a trunk, and (by a combination of\r\nmerit on the custodian's part and luck on his own) recovered them\r\nfifteen years afterwards, _Atala_, _René_, and a few other fragments\r\nhaving alone accompanied him. These were published independently, the\r\n_Génie_ following. _Les Martyrs_ was a later composition altogether,\r\nwhile _Les Natchez_, the _matrix_ of both the shorter stories, and\r\nincluded, as one supposes, in the 2383 waifs, was partly rewritten and\r\nwholly published later still. A body of fiction of such a singular\r\ncharacter is, as has been said, not altogether easy to treat; but,\r\nwithout much change in the method usually pursued in this _History_, we\r\nmay perhaps do best by first giving a brief argument of the various\r\ncontents and then taking up the censure, in no evil sense, of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Atala._]\r\n\r\n_Atala_ is short and almost entirely to the point. The heroine is a\r\nhalf-breed girl with a Spanish father and for mother an Indian of some\r\nrank in her tribe, who has subsequently married a benevolent chief. She\r\nis regarded as a native princess, and succeeds in rescuing from the\r\nusual torture and death, and fleeing with, a captive chief of another\r\n\"nation.\" This is Chactas, important in _René_ and also in the _Natchez_\r\nframework. They direct their flight northwards to the French settlements\r\n(it is late seventeenth or early eighteenth century throughout), and of\r\ncourse fall in love with each other. But Atala's mother, a Christian,\r\nhas, in the tumult of her early misfortunes, vowed her daughter's\r\nvirginity or death; and when, just before the crucial moment, a\r\nmissionary opportunely or inopportunely occurs, Atala has already taken\r\npoison, with the object, it would appear, not so much of preventing as\r\nof avenging, of her own free will, a breach of the vow. The rest of the\r\nstory is supplied by the vain attempts of the good father to save her,\r\nhis evangelising efforts towards the pair, and the sorrows of Chactas\r\nafter his beloved's death. The piece, of course, shows that exaggerated\r\nand somewhat morbid pathos of circumstance which is the common form of\r\nthe early romantic efforts, whether in England, Germany, or France. But\r\nthe pathos _is_ pathos; the unfamiliar scenery, unlike that of Bernardin\r\nde Saint-Pierre (to whom, of course, Chateaubriand is much indebted,\r\nthough he had actually seen what he describes), is not overdone, and\r\nsuits the action and characters very well indeed. Chactas here is the\r\nbest of all the \"noble savages,\" and (what hardly any other of them is)\r\npositively good. Atala is really tragic and really gracious. The\r\nmissionary stands to other fictitious, and perhaps some real,\r\nmissionaries very much as Chactas does to other savages of story, if not\r\nof life. The proportion of the whole is good, and in the humble opinion\r\nof the present critic it is by far Chateaubriand's best thing in all\r\nperhaps but mere writing.\r\n\r\nAnd even in this it is bad to beat, in him or out of him. The small\r\nspace forbids mere surplusage of description, and the plot--as all plots\r\nshould do, but, alas! as few succeed in doing--acts as a bellows to\r\nkindle the flame and intensify the heat of something far better than\r\ndescription itself--passionate character. There are many fine\r\nthings--mixed, no doubt, with others not so fine--in the tempestuous\r\nscene of the death of Atala, which should have been the conclusion of\r\nthe story. But this, in its own way, seems to me little short of\r\nmagnificent:\r\n\r\n     \"I implored you to fly; and yet I knew I should die if you\r\n     were not with me. I longed for the shadow of the forest; and\r\n     yet I feared to be with you in a desert place. Ah! if the\r\n     cost had only been that of quitting parents, friends,\r\n     country! if--terrible as it is to say it--there had been\r\n     nothing at stake but the loss of my own soul.[23] But, O my\r\n     mother! thy shade was always there--thy shade reproaching me\r\n     with the torments it would suffer. I heard thy complaints; I\r\n     saw the flames of Hell ready to consume thee. My nights were\r\n     dry places full of ghosts; my days were desolate; the dew of\r\n     the evening dried up as it touched my burning skin. I opened\r\n     my lips to the breeze; and the breeze, instead of cooling\r\n     me, was itself set aglow by the fire of my breath. What\r\n     torment, Chactas! to see you always near me, far from all\r\n     other humankind in the deepest solitude, and yet to feel\r\n     that between us there was an insuperable barrier! To pass my\r\n     life at your feet, to serve you as a slave, to bring you\r\n     food and lay your couch in some secret corner of the\r\n     universe, would have been for me supremest happiness; and\r\n     this happiness was within my touch, yet I could not enjoy\r\n     it. Of what plans did I not dream? What vision did not arise\r\n     from this sad heart? Sometimes, as I gazed on you, I went so\r\n     far as to form desires as mad as they were guilty: sometimes\r\n     I could have wished that there were no living creatures on\r\n     earth but you and me; sometimes, feeling that there was a\r\n     divinity mocking my wicked transports, I could have wished\r\n     that divinity annihilated, if only, locked in your arms, I\r\n     might have sunk from abyss to abyss with the ruins of God\r\n     and of the world. Even now--shall I say it?--even now, when\r\n     eternity waits to engulf me, when I am about to appear\r\n     before the inexorable Judge--at the very moment when my\r\n     mother may be rejoicing to see my virginity devour my\r\n     life--even now, by a terrible contradiction, I carry with me\r\n     the regret that I have not been yours!\"\r\n\r\nAt this let who will laugh or sneer, yawn or cavil. But as literature it\r\nlooks back to Sappho and Catullus and the rest, and forward to all great\r\nlove-poetry since, while as something that is even greater than\r\nliterature--life--it carries us up to the highest Heaven and down to the\r\nnethermost Hell.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _René._]\r\n\r\n_René_[24] has greater fame and no doubt exercised far more influence;\r\nindeed in this respect _Atala_ could not do much, for it is not the\r\neternal, but the temporal, which \"influences.\" But, in the same humble\r\nopinion, it is extremely inferior. The French Werther[25] (for the\r\nattempt to rival Goethe on his own lines is hardly, if at all, veiled)\r\nis a younger son of a gentle family in France, whose father dies. He\r\nlives for a time with an elder brother, who seems to be \"more kin than\r\nkind,\" and a sister Amélie, to whom he is fondly, but fraternally,\r\nattached. René has begun the trick of disappointment early, and, after a\r\ntime, determines to travel, fancying when he leaves home that his sister\r\nis actually glad to get rid of him. Of course it is a case of _coelum\r\nnon animum_. When he returns he is half-surprised but (for him) wholly\r\nglad to be at first warmly welcomed by Amélie; but after a little while\r\nshe leaves him, takes the veil, and lets him know at the last moment\r\nthat it is because her affection for him is more than sisterly, that\r\nthis was the reason of her apparent joy when he left her, and that\r\nassociation with him is too much for her passion.[26] _She_ makes an\r\nexemplary nun in a sea-side convent, and dies early of disease caught\r\nwhile nursing others. _He_, his wretchedness and hatred of life reaching\r\ntheir acme, exiles himself to Louisiana, and gets himself adopted by the\r\ntribe of the Natchez, where Chactas is a (though not _the_) chief.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difference between its importance and its merit.]\r\n\r\nNow, of course, if we are content to take a bill and write down Byron\r\nand Lamartine, Senancour and _Jacopo Ortis_ (otherwise Ugo Foscolo),\r\nMusset, Matthew Arnold, and _tutti quanti_, as debtors to _René_, we\r\ngive the tale or episode a historical value which cannot be denied;\r\nwhile its positive aesthetic quality, though it may vary very much in\r\ndifferent estimates, cannot be regarded as merely worthless. Also, once\r\nmore, there is real pathos, especially as far as Amélie is concerned,\r\nthough the entire unexpectedness of the revelation of her fatal passion,\r\nand the absolute lack of any details as to its origin, rise, and\r\ncircumstances, injure sympathy to some extent. But that sympathy, as far\r\nas the present writer is concerned, fails altogether with regard to René\r\nhimself. If his melancholy were traceable to _mutual_ passion of the\r\nforbidden kind, or if it had arisen from the stunning effect of the\r\nrevelation thereof on his sister's side, there would be no difficulty.\r\nBut, though these circumstances may to some extent accentuate, they have\r\nnothing to do with causing the _weltschmerz_ or _selbst-schmerz_, or\r\nwhatever it is to be called, of this not very heroic hero. Nor has\r\nChateaubriand taken the trouble--which Goethe, with his more critical\r\nsense of art, _did_ take--to make René go through the whole course of\r\nthe Preacher, or great part of it, before discovering that all was\r\nvanity. He is merely, from the beginning, a young gentleman affected\r\nwith mental jaundice, who cannot or will not discover or take\r\npsychological calomel enough to cure him. It does not seem in the least\r\nlikely that if Amélie had been content to live with him as merely \"in\r\nall good, all honour\" a loving and comforting sister, he would have\r\nreally been able to say, like Geraldine in Coleridge's original draft of\r\n_Christabel_, \"I'm better now.\"\r\n\r\nHe is, in fact, what Werther is not--though his own followers to a large\r\nextent are--mainly if not merely a Sulky Young Man: and one cannot help\r\nimagining that if, in pretty early days, some one had been good enough\r\nto apply to him that Herb Pantagruelion, in form not exactly of a halter\r\nbut of a rope's end, with which O'Brien cured Peter Simple's _mal de\r\nmer_, his _mal du siècle_ would have been cured likewise.\r\n\r\nOf course it is possible for any one to say, \"You are a Philistine and a\r\nVulgarian. You wish to regard life through a horse-collar,\" etc., etc.\r\nBut these reproaches would leave my withers quite ungalled. I think\r\n_Ecclesiastes_ one of the very greatest books in the world's literature,\r\nand _Hamlet_ the greatest play, with the possible exception of the\r\n_Agamemnon_. It is the abysmal sadness quite as much as the _furor\r\narduus_ of Lucretius that makes me think him the mightiest of Latin\r\npoets. I would not give the mystical melancholy of certain poems of\r\nDonne's for half a hundred of the liveliest love-songs of the time, and\r\ncould extend the list page-long and more if it would not savour of\r\nostentation in more ways than one. But mere temperamental [Greek:\r\nheôlokrasia] or [Greek: kraipalê] (next-day nausea), without even the\r\nexaltation of a previous orgy to ransom it,--mere spleen and sulks and\r\nnaughty-childishness,--seem to me not great things at all. You may not\r\nbe able to help your spleen, but you can \"cook\" it; you may have qualm\r\nand headache, but in work of some sort, warlike or peaceful, there is\r\nalways small beer, or brandy and soda (with even, if necessary,\r\ncapsicum or bromide), for the ailment. The Renés who can do nothing but\r\nsulk, except when they blunder themselves and make other people\r\nuncomfortable in attempting to do something, who \"never do a [manly]\r\nthing and never say a [kind] one,\" are, I confess, not to my taste.[27]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Les Natchez._]\r\n\r\nBoth these stories, as will have been seen, have a distinctly religious\r\nelement; in fact, a distinctly religious purpose. The larger\r\nnovel-romance of which they form episodes, as well as its later and\r\ngreater successor, _Les Martyrs_, increase the element in both cases,\r\nthe purpose in the latter; but one of the means by which this increase\r\nis effected has certainly lost--whether it may or may not ever\r\nrecover--its attraction, except to a student of literary history who is\r\nwell out of his novitiate. Such a person should see at once that\r\nChateaubriand's elaborate adoption, from Tasso and Milton, of the system\r\nof interspersed scenes of Divine and diabolic conclaves and\r\ninterferences with the story, is an important, if not a wholly happy,\r\ninstance of that general Romantic _reversion_ to earlier literary\r\ndevices, and even atmospheres, of which the still rather enigmatic\r\npersonage who rests enisled off Saint-Malo was so great an apostle. And\r\nit was probably effectual for its time. Classicists could not quarrel\r\nwith it, for it had its precedents, indeed its origin, in Homer and\r\nVirgil; Romanticists (of that less exclusive class who admitted the\r\nRenaissance as well as the Dark and Middle Ages) could not but welcome\r\nit for its great modern defenders and examples. I cannot say that I\r\nenjoy it: but I can tolerate it, and there is no doubt at all, odd as it\r\nmay seem to the merely twentieth-century reader, that it did something\r\nto revive the half-extinct religiosity which had been starved and\r\npoisoned in the later days of the _ancien régime_, forcibly suppressed\r\nunder the Republic, and only officially licensed by the Napoleonic\r\nsystem. In _Les Martyrs_ it has even a certain \"grace of congruity,\"[28]\r\nbut in regard to _Les Natchez_, with which we are for the moment\r\nconcerned, almost enough (with an example or two to come presently) has\r\nbeen said about it.\r\n\r\nThe book, as a whole, suffers, unquestionably and considerably, from the\r\nresults of two defects in its author. He was not born, as Scott was a\r\nlittle later, to get the historical novel at last into full life and\r\nactivity; and it would not be unfair to question whether he was a born\r\nnovelist at all, though he had not a few of the qualifications necessary\r\nto the kind, and exercised, coming as and when he did, an immense\r\ninfluence upon it. The subject is too obscure. Its only original\r\n_vates_, Charlevoix, though always a respectable name to persons of some\r\nacquaintance with literature and history, has never been much more,\r\neither in France or in England. The French, unluckily for themselves,\r\nnever took much interest in their transatlantic possessions while they\r\nhad them; and their dealings with the Indians then, and ours afterwards,\r\nand those of the Americans since, have never been exactly of the kind\r\nthat give on both sides a subject such as may be found in all mediaeval\r\nand most Renaissance matters; in the Fronde; in the English Civil War;\r\nin the great struggles of France and England from 1688 to 1815; in the\r\nJacobite risings; in La Vendée; and in other historical periods and\r\nprovinces too many to mention. On the other hand, the abstract \"noble\r\nsavage\" is a faded object of exhausted _engouement_, than which there\r\nare few things less exhilarating. The Indian _ingénu_ (a very different\r\none from Voltaire's) Outougamiz and his _ingénue_ Mila are rather nice;\r\nbut Celuta (the ill-fated girl who loves René and whom he marries,\r\nbecause in a sort of way he cannot help it) is an eminent example of\r\nthat helpless kind of quiet misfortune the unprofitableness of which Mr.\r\nArnold has confessed and registered in a famous passage. Chactas\r\nmaintains a respectable amount of interest, and his visit to the court\r\nof Louis XIV. takes very fair rank among a well-known group of things of\r\nwhich it is not Philistine to speak as old-fashioned, because they never\r\npossessed much attraction, except as being new- or regular-fashioned.\r\nBut the villain Ondouré has almost as little of the fire of Hell as of\r\nthat of Heaven, and his paramour and accomplice Akansie carries very\r\nlittle \"conviction\" with her. In short, the merit of the book, besides\r\nthe faint one of having been the original framework of _Atala_ and\r\n_René_, is almost limited to its atmosphere, and the alterative\r\nqualities thereof--things now in a way ancient history--requiring even a\r\nconsiderable dose of the not-universally-possessed historic sense to\r\ndiscern and appreciate them.\r\n\r\nOutside the \"Histoire de Chactas\" (which might, like _Atala_ and _René_\r\nthemselves, have been isolated with great advantage), and excepting\r\nlikewise the passages concerning Outougamiz and Mila--which possess, in\r\nconsiderable measure and gracious fashion, what some call the \"idyllic\"\r\nquality--I have found it, on more than one attempt, difficult to take\r\nmuch interest in _Les Natchez_, not merely for the reasons already\r\ngiven, but chiefly owing to them. René's appearances (and he is\r\ngenerally in background or foreground) serve better than anything in any\r\nother book, perhaps, to explain and justify the old notion that\r\n_accidia_[29] of his kind is not only a fault in the individual, but a\r\npositive ill omen and nuisance[30] to others. Neither in the Indian\r\ncharacters (with the exceptions named) nor among the French and creole\r\ndoes one find relief: and when one passes from them to the \"machinery\"\r\nparts--where, for instance, a \"perverse couple,\" Satan and La Renommée\r\n(_not_ the ship that Trunnion took), embark on a journey in a car with\r\nwinged horses--it must be an odd taste which finds things improved. In\r\nGreek verse, in Latin verse, or even in Milton's English one could stand\r\nNight, docile to the orders of Satan, condescending to deflect a hatchet\r\nwhich is whistling unpleasantly close to René's ear, not that he may be\r\nbenefited, but preserved for more sufferings. In comparatively plain\r\nFrench prose--the qualification is intentional, as will be seen a little\r\nlater--with a scene and time barely two hundred years off now and not a\r\nhundred then, though in a way unfamiliar--the thing won't do. \"Time,\" at\r\nthe orders of the Prince of Darkness, cutting down trees to make a\r\nstockade for the Natchez in the eighteenth century, alas! contributes\r\nagain the touch of weak allegory, in neither case helping the effect;\r\nwhile, although the plot is by no means badly evolved, the want of\r\ninterest in the characters renders it ineffective.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Les Martyrs._]\r\n\r\nThe defects of _Les Martyrs_[31] are fewer in number and less in degree,\r\nwhile its merits are far more than proportionally greater and more\r\nnumerous. Needing less historical reinforcement, it enjoys much more.\r\n_Les Natchez_ is almost the last, certainly the last important novel of\r\nsavage life, as distinguished from \"boys' books\" about savages. _Les\r\nMartyrs_ is the first of a line of remarkable if not always successful\r\nclassical novels from Lockhart's _Valerius_ to Gissing's _Veranilda_. It\r\nhas nothing really in common with the kind of classical story which\r\nlasted from _Télémaque_ to _Belisarius_ and later. And what is more, it\r\nis perhaps better than any of its followers except Kingsley's\r\n_Hypatia_, which is admittedly of a mixed kind--a nineteenth-century\r\nnovel, with events, scenes, and _décor_ of the fifth century. If it has\r\nnot the spectacular and popular appeal of _The Last Days of Pompeii_, it\r\nescapes, as that does not, the main drawback of almost all the\r\nothers--the \"classical-dictionary\" element: and if, on the other, its\r\nauthor knew less about Christianity than Cardinals Wiseman and Newman,\r\nhe knew more about lay \"humans\" than the authors of _Fabiola_ and\r\n_Callista_.\r\n\r\nIt is probably unnecessary to point out at any great length that some of\r\nthe drawbacks of _Les Natchez_ disappear almost automatically in _Les\r\nMartyrs_. The supernatural machinery is, on the hypothesis and at the\r\ntime of the book, strictly congruous and proper; while, as a matter of\r\nfact, it is in proportion rather less than more used. The time and\r\nevents--those of the persecution under Diocletian--are familiar,\r\ninteresting, and, in a French term for which we have no exact\r\nequivalent, _dignes_. There is no sulky spider of a René crawling\r\nabout the piece; and though history is a little strained to\r\nprovide incidents,[32] \"that's not much,\" and they are not in\r\nthemselves improbable in any bad sense or degree. Moreover, the\r\nclassical-dictionary element, which, as has been said, is so awkward to\r\nhandle, is, at least after the beginning, not too much drawn upon.\r\n\r\nThe book, in its later modern editions, is preceded not merely by\r\nseveral Prefaces, but by an _Examen_ in the old fashion, and fortified\r\nby those elaborate citation-notes[33] from authorities ancient and\r\nmodern which were a mania at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century, and which sometimes divert and sometimes\r\nenrage more modern readers in work so different as _Lalla Rookh_ and\r\n_The Pursuits of Literature_, while they provided at the time material\r\nfor immortal jokes in such other work as the _Anti-Jacobin_ poems. In\r\nthe Prefaces Chateaubriand discusses the prose epic, and puts himself,\r\nquite unnecessarily, under the protection of _Télémaque_: in the\r\n_Examen_ he deals systematically with the objections, religious, moral,\r\nand literary, which had been made against the earlier editions of the\r\nbook. But these things are now little more than curiosities for the\r\nstudent, though they retain some general historical importance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The story.]\r\n\r\nThe book starts (after an \"Invocation,\" proper to its scheme but perhaps\r\nnot specially attractive \"to us\") with an account of the household of\r\nDemodocus, a Homerid of Chios, who in Diocletian's earlier and\r\nunpersecuting days, after living happily but for too short a time in\r\nCrete with his wife Epicharis, loses her, though she leaves him one\r\nlittle daughter, Cymodocée, born in the sacred woods of Mount Ida\r\nitself. Demodocus is only too glad to accept an invitation to become\r\nhigh priest of a new Temple of Homer in Messenia, on the slopes of\r\nanother mountain, less, but not so much less, famous, Ithome. Cymodocée\r\nbecomes very beautiful, and receives, but rejects, the addresses of\r\nHierocles, proconsul of Achaia, and a favourite of Galerius. One day,\r\nworshipping in the forest at a solitary Altar of the Nymphs, she meets a\r\nyoung stranger whom (she is of course still a pagan) she mistakes for\r\nEndymion, but who talks Christianity to her, and reveals himself as\r\nEudore, son of Lasthenes. As it turns out, her father knows this person,\r\nwho has the renown of a distinguished soldier.\r\n\r\nFrom this almost any one who has read a few thousand novels--almost any\r\nintelligent person who has read a few hundred--can lay out the probable\r\nplot. Love of Eudore and Cymodocée; conversion of the latter; jealousy\r\nand intrigues of Hierocles; adventures past and future of Eudore;\r\ntransfer of scene to Rome; prevalence of Galerius over Diocletian;\r\npersecution, martyrdom, and supernatural triumph. But the \"fillings up\"\r\nare not banal; and the book is well worth reading from divers points of\r\nview. In the earliest part there is a little too much Homer,[34]\r\nnaturally enough perhaps. The ancient world changed slowly, and we know\r\nthat at this particular time Greeks (if not also Romans) rather played\r\nat archaising manners. Still, it is probably not quite safe to take the\r\nmemorable, if not very resultful, journey in which Telemachus was,\r\nrather undeservedly, so lucky as to see Helen and drink Nepenthe[35] and\r\nto reproduce it with guide- and etiquette-book exactness, _c._ A. D.\r\n300. Yet this is, as has been said, very natural; and it arouses many\r\npleasant reminiscences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its \"panoramic\" quality.]\r\n\r\nThe book, moreover, has two great qualities which were almost,\r\nif not quite, new in the novel. In the first place, it has a\r\ncertain _panoramic_ element which admits--which indeed\r\nnecessitates--picturesqueness. Much of it is, almost as necessarily,\r\n_récit_ (Eudore giving the history of his travels and campaigns); but it\r\nis _récit_ of a vividness which had never before been known in French,\r\nout of the most accomplished drama, and hardly at all in prose. The\r\nadventures of Eudore require this most, of course, and they get it. His\r\nearly wild-oats at Rome, which earn him temporary excommunication; his\r\nservice in the wars with the Franks, where, for almost the only time in\r\nliterature, Pharamond and Mérovée become living creatures; his captivity\r\nwith them; his triumphs in Britain and his official position in\r\nBrittany, where the entrance of the Druidess Velléda and the fatal love\r\nbetween them provide perhaps the most famous and actually one of the\r\nmost effective of the episodes of the book--all \"stand out from the\r\ncanvas,\" as the old phrase goes. Nor is the mastery lost when _récit_\r\nbecomes direct action, in the scenes of the persecution, and the final\r\npurification of the hero and crowning of the heroine in the\r\namphitheatre. \"The work burns\"; and, while it is practically certain\r\nthat the writer knew the Scudéry romances, the contrast of this\r\n\"burning\" quality becomes so striking as almost to justify,\r\ncomparatively if not positively, the accusations of frigidity and\r\nlanguor which have been somewhat excessively brought against the earlier\r\nperformances. There is not the passion of _Atala_--it would have been\r\nout of place: and there is not the soul-dissection of _René_, for there\r\nis nothing morbid enough to require the scalpel. But, on the other hand,\r\nthere is the bustle--if that be not too degrading a word--which is\r\nwanting in both; the vividness of action and of change; colour, variety,\r\nsuspense, what may perhaps best be called in one word \"pulse,\" giving,\r\nas a necessary consequence, life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And its remarkable advance in style.]\r\n\r\nAnd this great advance is partly, if not mainly, achieved by\r\nanother--the novelty of _style_. Chateaubriand had set out to give--has,\r\nindeed, as far as his intention goes, maintained throughout--an effort\r\nat _le style noble_, the already familiar rhetoric, of which, in French,\r\nCorneille had been the Dryden and Racine the Pope, while it had, in his\r\nown youth, sunk to the artifice of Delille in verse and the \"emphasis\"\r\nof Thomas in prose. He has sometimes achieved the best, and not seldom\r\nsomething that is by no means the worst, of this. But, consciously or\r\nunconsciously, he has more often put in the old bottles of form new wine\r\nof spirit, which has not only burst them, but by some very satisfactory\r\nmiracle of literature shed itself into new receptacles, this time not at\r\nall leathery but glass of iridescent colour and graceful shape. It was\r\nalmost inevitable that such a process, at such a time, and with such a\r\nlanguage--for Chateaubriand did not go to the real \"ancient mother\" of\r\npre-_grand siècle_ French--should be now and then merely magniloquent,\r\nthat it should sometimes fall short of, or overleap, even magniloquence\r\nand become bombast. But sometimes also, and not so seldom, it attains\r\nmagnificence as well; and the promise, at least the opportunity, of such\r\nmagnificence in capable followers can hardly be mistaken. As in his\r\nyounger contemporary, compatriot, and, beyond all doubt, disciple,\r\nLamennais, the results are often crude, unequal, disappointing;\r\ninsufficiently smelted ore, insufficiently ripened and cellared wine.\r\nBut the quantity and quality of pure metal--the inspiriting virtue of\r\nthe vintage--in them is extraordinary: and once more it must be\r\nremembered that, for the novel, all this was absolutely new. In this\r\nrespect, if in no other, though perhaps he was so in others also,\r\nChateaubriand is a Columbus of prose fiction. Neither in French nor in\r\nEnglish, very imperfectly in German, and, so far as I know, not in any\r\nother language to even the smallest degree, had \"prose-poetry\" been\r\nattempted in this department. \"Ossian\" perhaps must have some of the\r\ncredit: the Bible still more. But wherever the capital was found it was\r\nChateaubriand who put it into the business of novel-writing and turned\r\nout the first specimens of that business with the new materials and\r\nplant procured by the funds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chateaubriand's Janus-position in this.]\r\n\r\nSome difficulties, which hamper any attempt to illustrate and support\r\nthis high praise, cannot require much explanation to make them obvious.\r\nIt has not been the custom of this book to give large untranslated\r\nextracts: and it is at least the opinion of its author that in matters\r\nof style, translation, even if it be of a much higher quality than he\r\nconceives himself able to offer, is, if not quite worthless, very\r\ninadequate. Moreover, it is (or should be) well known that the qualities\r\nof the old French _style noble_--which, as has been said, Chateaubriand\r\ndeliberately adopted, as his starting-point if nothing more--are, even\r\nin their own language, and still more when reproduced in any other, full\r\nof dangers for foreign appreciation. The no doubt largely ignorant and\r\nin any case mistaken contempt for French poetry and poetic prose which\r\nso long prevailed among us, and from which even such a critic and such a\r\nlover (to some extent) of French as Matthew Arnold was not free, was\r\nmainly concerned with this very point. To take a single instance, the\r\npart of De Quincey's \"Essay on Rhetoric\" which deals with French is made\r\npositively worthless by the effects of this almost racial prejudice.\r\nLiteral translation of the more _flamboyant_ kind of French writing has\r\nbeen, even with some of our greatest, an effective, if a somewhat\r\nfacile, means of procuring a laugh. Furthermore, it has to be remembered\r\nthat this application of ornate style to prose fiction is undoubtedly to\r\nsome extent an extraneous thing in the consideration of the novel\r\nitself. It is \"a grand set off\" (in the old phrase) to tale-telling; but\r\nit is not precisely of its essence. It deserves to be _constaté_,\r\nrecorded and set to the credit of those who practise it, and especially\r\nof those who first introduced it. But it is a question whether, in the\r\nnecessarily limited space of a book like this, the consideration of it\r\nought to occupy a large room.\r\n\r\nStill, though the warning, \"Be not too bold,\" should never be forgotten,\r\nit should be remembered that it was given only once and its contrary\r\nreiterated: so here goes for one of the most perilous of all possible\r\nadventures--a translation of Chateaubriand's own boldest undertaking,\r\nthe description of the City of God, in which he was following not only\r\nthe greatest of the Hebrew prophets, but the Vision of Patmos itself.\r\n\r\n     (_\"Les Martyrs,\" Book III., opening. The Prayer of Cyril,\r\n     Bishop of Lacedaemon, has come before the Throne._)\r\n\r\n     [Sidenote: Illustrated.]\r\n\r\n     At the centre of all created worlds, in the midst of\r\n     innumerable stars which serve as its bastions as well as\r\n     avenues and roads to it, there floats the limitless City of\r\n     God, the marvels whereof no mortal tongue can tell. The\r\n     Eternal Himself laid its twelve foundations, and surrounded\r\n     it with the wall of jasper that the beloved disciple saw\r\n     measured by an angel with a rod of gold. Clothed with the\r\n     glory of the Most High, the unseen Jerusalem is decked as a\r\n     bride for her bridegroom. O monumental structures of earth!\r\n     ye come not near these of the Holy City. There the richness\r\n     of the matter rivals the perfection of the form. There hang,\r\n     royally suspended, the galleries of diamond and sapphire\r\n     feebly imitated by human skill in the gardens of Babylon.\r\n     There rise triumphal arches, fashioned of brightest stars.\r\n     There are linked together porticoes of suns extended across\r\n     the spaces of the firmament, like the columns of Palmyra\r\n     over the sands of the desert. This architecture is alive.\r\n     The City of God has a soul of its own. There is no mere\r\n     matter in the abiding places of the Spirit; no death in the\r\n     locality of eternal existence. The grosser words which our\r\n     muse is forced to employ deceive us, for they invest with\r\n     body that which is only as a divine dream, in the passing of\r\n     a blissful sleep.\r\n\r\n     Gardens of delight extend round the radiant Jerusalem. A\r\n     river flows from the throne of the Almighty, watering the\r\n     Celestial Eden with floods of pure love and of the wisdom of\r\n     God. The mystic wave divides into streams which entwine\r\n     themselves, separate, rejoin, and part again, giving\r\n     nourishment to the immortal vine, to the lily that is like\r\n     unto the Bride, and to all the flowers which perfume the\r\n     couch of the Spouse. The Tree of Life shoots up on the Hill\r\n     of Incense; and, but a little farther, that of Knowledge\r\n     spreads on all sides its deep-planted roots and its\r\n     innumerable branches, carrying hidden in the golden leafage\r\n     the secrets of the Godhead, the occult laws of Nature, the\r\n     truths of morality and of the intellect, the immutable\r\n     principles of good and of evil. The learning which\r\n     intoxicates _us_ is the common food of the Elect; for in the\r\n     empire of Sovereign Intelligence the fruit of science no\r\n     longer brings death. Often do the two great ancestors of the\r\n     human race come and shed such tears as the Just can still\r\n     let flow in the shadow of the wondrous Tree.\r\n\r\n     The light which lightens these abodes of bliss is compact of\r\n     the rose of morning, of the flame of noon, of the purple of\r\n     even; yet no star appears on the glowing horizon. No sun\r\n     rises and no sun goes down on the country where nothing\r\n     ends, where nothing begins. But an ineffable clearness,\r\n     showering from all sides like a tender dew, maintains the\r\n     unbroken[36] daylight in a delectable eternity.\r\n\r\nOf course any one who is so minded may belittle this as classically\r\ncold; even as to some extent _neo_-classically bedizened; as more like,\r\nlet us say, Moore's _Epicurean_ than like our greater \"prose-poets\" of\r\nthe seventeenth and the nineteenth centuries. The presence in\r\nChateaubriand of this dose of the style that was passing, and that he\r\nhelped to make pass, has been admitted already: but I confess I think it\r\nis only a dose. Those who care to look up the matter for themselves\r\nmight, if they do not choose to read the whole, turn to the admirable\r\npicture of camp-life on the Lower Rhine at the opening of Book VI. as a\r\nshort contrast, while the story is full of others. Nor should one forget\r\nto add that Chateaubriand can, when he chooses, be epigrammatic as well\r\nas declamatory. \"Such is the ugliness of man when he bids farewell to\r\nhis soul and, so to speak, keeps house only with his body\" is a phrase\r\nwhich might possibly shock La Harpe, but which is, as far as I remember,\r\noriginal, and is certainly crisp and effective enough.\r\n\r\nReassembling, then, the various points which we have endeavoured to make\r\nin respect of his position as novelist, it may once more be urged that\r\nif not precisely a great master of the complete art of novel-writing, by\r\nactual example, he shows no small expertness in various parts of it: and\r\nthat, as a teacher and experimenter in new developments of method and\r\nindication of new material, he has few superiors in his own country and\r\nnot very many elsewhere. That in this pioneer quality, as well as in\r\nmere contemporaneousness, he may, though a greater writer, be yoked with\r\nthe authoress of _Corinne_ need hardly be argued, for the accounts given\r\nof the two should have sufficiently established it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] Although, except in special cases, biographical notices are not\r\ngiven here, the reader may be reminded that she was born in 1766, the\r\ndaughter of Necker and of Gibbon's early love, Susanne Curchod; married\r\nat twenty the Swedish ambassador, Baron of Staël-Holstein; sympathised\r\nat first with the Revolution, but was horrified at the murder of the\r\nking, and escaped, with some difficulty, from Paris to England, where,\r\nas well as in' Germany and at Coppet, her own house in Switzerland, she\r\npassed the time till French things settled down under Napoleon. With him\r\nshe tried to get on, as a duplicate of himself in petticoats and the\r\nrealm of mind. But this was clearly impossible, and she had once more to\r\nretire to Coppet. She had separated, though without positive quarrel,\r\nfrom her husband, whom, however, she attended on his death-bed; and the\r\nexact character of her _liaisons_ with others, especially M. de Narbonne\r\nand Benjamin Constant, is not easy to determine. In 1812 she married,\r\nprivately, a young officer, Rocca by name, returned to Paris before and\r\nafter the Hundred Days, and died there in 1817.\r\n\r\n[9] I never can make up my mind whether I am more sorry that Madame\r\nNecker did not marry Gibbon or that Mademoiselle Necker did not, as was\r\nsubsequently on the cards, marry Pitt. The results in either case--both,\r\nalas! could hardly have come off--would have been most curious.\r\n\r\n[10] The most obvious if not the only possible reason for this would be\r\nintended outrage, murder, and suicide; but though Valorbe is a\r\nrobustious kind of idiot, he does not seem to have made up such mind as\r\nhe has to this agreeable combination.\r\n\r\n[11] I forget whether other characters have been identified, but Léonce\r\ndoes not appear to have much in him of M. de Narbonne, Corinne's chief\r\nlover of the period, who seems to have been a sort of French\r\nChesterfield, without the wit, which nobody denies our man, or the real\r\ngood-nature which he possessed.\r\n\r\n[12] Perhaps, after all, _not_ too many, for they all richly deserve it.\r\n\r\n[13] Eyes like the Ravenswing's, \"as b-b-big as billiard balls\" and of\r\nsome brightness, are allowed her, but hardly any other good point.\r\n\r\n[14] I never pretended to be an art-critic, save as complying with\r\nBlake's negative injunction or qualification \"not to be connoisseured\r\nout of my senses,\" and I do not know what is the technical word in the\r\narts of design corresponding to [Greek: dianoia] in literature.\r\n\r\n[15] I hope this iteration may not seem too damnable. It is intended to\r\nbring before the reader's mind the utterly _willowish_ character of\r\nOswald, Lord Nelvil. The slightest impact of accident will bend down,\r\nthe weakest wind of circumstance blow about, his plans and preferences.\r\n\r\n[16] That he seems to have unlimited leave is not perhaps, for a peer in\r\nthe period, to be cavilled at; the manner in which he alternately breaks\r\nblood-vessels and is up to fighting in the tropics may be rather more\r\nso.\r\n\r\n[17] As I may have remarked elsewhere, they often seem to confuse it\r\nwith \"priggishness,\" \"cant,\" and other amiable _cosas de Inglaterra_.\r\n(The late M. Jules Lemaître, as Professor Ker reminds me, even gave the\r\npicturesque but quite inadequate description: \"Le snob est un mouton de\r\nPanurge prétentieux, un mouton qui saute à la file, mais d'un air\r\nsuffisant.\") We cannot disclaim the general origin, but we may protest\r\nagainst confusion of the particular substance.\r\n\r\n[18] _Corinne, ou l'Italie._\r\n\r\n[19] If anybody thinks _Wilhelm Meister_ or the _Wahlverwandtschaften_ a\r\ngood novel, I am his very humble servant in begging to differ. Freytag's\r\n_Soll und Haben_ is perhaps the nearest approach; but, on English or\r\nFrench standards, it could only get a fair second class.\r\n\r\n[20] Corinne \"walks and talks\" (as the lady in the song was asked to do,\r\nbut without requiring the offer of a blue silk gown) with her Oswald all\r\nover the churches and palaces and monuments of Rome, \"doing\" also\r\nNaples, Venice, etc.\r\n\r\n[21] She was rather proud of these mighty members: and some readers may\r\nrecall that not least Heinesque remark of the poet who so much shocks\r\nKaiser Wilhelm II., \"Those of the Venus of Milo are not more beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n[22] Including also a third short story, _Le Dernier Abencérage_, which\r\nbelongs, constructively, rather to the _Voyages_. It is in a way the\r\nliveliest (at least the most \"incidented\") of all, but not the most\r\ninteresting, and with very little _temporal_ colour, though some local.\r\nIt may, however, be taken as another proof of Chateaubriand's importance\r\nin the germinal way, for it starts the Romantic interest in Spanish\r\nthings. The contrast with the dirty rubbish of Pigault-Lebrun's _La\r\nFolie Espagnole_ is also not negligible.\r\n\r\n[23] For the mother, in a fashion which the good Father-missionary most\r\nrighteously and indignantly denounces as unchristian, had staked her own\r\nsalvation on her daughter's obedience to the vow.\r\n\r\n[24] Its author, in the _Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe_, expressed a warm wish\r\nthat he had never written it, and hearty disgust at its puling admirers\r\nand imitators. This has been set down to hypocritical insincerity or the\r\nsourness of age: I see neither in it. It ought perhaps to be said that\r\nhe \"cut\" a good deal of the original version. The confession of Amélie\r\nwas at first less abrupt and so less effective, but the newer form does\r\nnot seem to me to better the state of René himself.\r\n\r\n[25] There had been a very early French imitation of _Werther_ itself\r\n(of the end especially), _Les dernières aventures du sieur d'Olban_, by\r\na certain Ramond, published in 1777, only three years after Goethe. It\r\nhad a great influence on Ch. Nodier (_v. inf._), who actually\r\nrepublished the thing in 1829.\r\n\r\n[26] This \"out-of-bounds\" passion will of course be recognised as a\r\nRomantic trait, though it had Classical suggestions. Chateaubriand\r\nappears to have been rather specially \"obsessed\" by this form of it, for\r\nhe not merely speaks constantly of René as _le frère d'Amélie_, but goes\r\nout of his way to make the good Father in _Atala_ refer, almost\r\necstatically, to the happiness of the more immediate descendants of Adam\r\nwho were _compelled_ to marry their sisters, if they married anybody. As\r\nI have never been able to take any interest in the discussions of the\r\nByron and Mrs. Leigh scandal, I am not sure whether this _tic_ of\r\nChateaubriand's has been noticed therein. But his influence on Byron was\r\nstrong and manifold, and Byron was particularly apt to do things,\r\nnaughty and other, because somebody else had done or suggested them. And\r\nof course it has, from very early days, been suggested that Amélie is an\r\nexperience of Chateaubriand's own. But this, like the investigations as\r\nto time and distance and possibility in his travels and much else also,\r\nis not for us. Once more I must be permitted to say that I am writing\r\nmuch about French novels, little about French novelists, and least of\r\nall about those novelists' biographers, critics, and so forth.\r\nExceptions may be admitted, but as exceptions only.\r\n\r\n[27] I once had to fight it out in public with a valued and valiant\r\nfriend for saying something like this in regard to Edgar of\r\nRavenswood--no doubt, in some sort a child of René's or of Nelvil's; but\r\nI was not put to submission. And Edgar had truer causes for sulks than\r\nhis spiritual ancestor had--at least before the tragedy of Amélie.\r\n\r\n[28] Not in the strict theological meaning of this phrase, of course;\r\nbut the misuse of it has aesthetic justification.\r\n\r\n[29] _I.e._ not mere \"sloth,\" but the black-blooded and sluggish\r\nmelancholy to which Dante pays so much attention in the _Inferno_. This\r\ndeadly sin we inadequately translate \"sloth,\" and (on one side of it) it\r\nis best defined in Dante's famous lines (_Inf._ vii. 121-3):\r\n\r\nTristi fummo Nell' aer dolce che dal sol s' allegra, Portando dentro\r\naccidioso fummo.\r\n\r\nHad Amélie sinned and not repented she might have been found in the\r\nSecond circle, flying alone; René, except _speciali gratia_, must have\r\nsunk to the Fourth.\r\n\r\n[30] For instance, he goes a-beaver-hunting with the Natchez, but his\r\nusual selfish moping prevents him from troubling to learn the laws of\r\nthe sport, and he kills females--an act at once offensive to Indian\r\nreligion, sportsmanship, and etiquette, horrifying to the consciences of\r\nhis adopted countrymen, and an actual _casus belli_ with the\r\nneighbouring tribes.\r\n\r\n[31] Its second title, _ou Le Triomphe de la Religion Chrétienne_,\r\nconnects it still more closely than _Les Natchez_ with _Le Génie du\r\nChristianisme_, which it immediately succeeded in composition, though\r\nthis took a long time. No book (it would seem in consequence)\r\nexemplifies the mania for annotation and \"justification\" more\r\nextensively. In vol. i. the proportion of notes to text is 112 to 270,\r\nin vol. ii. 123 to 221, and in vol. iii., including some extracts from\r\nthe Père Mambrun, 149 to 225.\r\n\r\n[32] Such as Eudore's early friendship at Rome, before the persecution\r\nunder Diocletian, with Augustine, who was not born till twenty years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n[33] See note above.\r\n\r\n[34] There cannot be too much Homer in Homer; there may be too much\r\noutside Homer.\r\n\r\n[35] If one had only been Telemachus at this time! It would have been a\r\ngood \"Declamation\" theme in the days of such things, \"Should a man--for\r\nthis one experience--consent to be Telemachus for the rest of his\r\nlife--and after?\"\r\n\r\n[36] In the original the word which I have translated \"unbroken\" is\r\n_éternel_, and with the adjacent _éternité_ illustrates (as do\r\n_tonnerre_ and _étonnante_ in Bossuet's famous passage on the death of\r\n\"Madame\") one of the minor but striking differences between French and\r\nEnglish rhetoric. Save for some very special purpose, we should consider\r\nsuch repetition a jingle at best, a cacophony at worst: they think it a\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPAUL DE KOCK, OTHER MINORS OF 1800-1830, AND NODIER\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The fate of popular minor novelists.]\r\n\r\nThe mediocre poet has had a hard fate pronounced against him of old; but\r\nthe minor novelist, perhaps because he is much more likely to get some\r\ngood things in his own time, has usually a harder lot still, and in more\r\nthan one way, after physical or popular death. In fact it may be said\r\nthat, the more popular he is in the one day, the more utterly forgotten\r\nhe is likely to be in the other. Besides the obvious facts that his\r\npopularity must always have been gained by the adoption of some more or\r\nless ephemeral fashion, and that plenty of his own kind are always ready\r\nto take his place--doing, like the heir in the old story, all they can\r\nto substitute _Requiescat in Pace_ for _Resurgam_ on his\r\nhatchment--there is a more mechanical reason for his occultation. The\r\nmore widely he or she has been read the more certain either has been of\r\nbeing \"read to pieces.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Examples of them.]\r\n\r\nThese fates, and especially the last, have weighed upon the minor French\r\nnovelists of the early nineteenth century perhaps even more heavily than\r\nupon our own: for the circulating library was an earlier and a more\r\nwidely spread institution in France than in England, and the lower and\r\nlowest middle classes were a good deal more given to reading, and\r\nespecially to \"light\" reading, there than here. Nor can it be said that\r\nany of the writers to be now mentioned, with one possible and one\r\ncertain exception, is of importance to literature as literature.\r\nBut all have their importance to literary--and especially\r\ndepartmental-literary--history, in ways which it is hoped presently to\r\nshow: and there is still amusement in some. The chief, though not the\r\nonly, names that require notice here are those of Mesdames de Montolieu\r\nand (again) de Genlis, of Ducray-Duminil, born almost as early as\r\nPigault-Lebrun, even earlier a novelist, and yoked with him by Victor\r\nHugo in respect of his novel _Lolotte et Fanfan_ in the sneer noted in\r\nthe last volume;[37] the _other_ Ducange, again as much \"other\" as the\r\nother Molière;[38] the Vicomte d'Arlincourt; and--a comparative (if,\r\naccording to some, blackish) swan among these not quite positive\r\ngeese--Paul de Kock. The eldest put in his work before the Revolution\r\nand the youngest before Waterloo, but the most prolific time of all was\r\nthat of the first two or three decades of the century with which we are\r\ndealing.\r\n\r\nWith these, but not of them--a producer at last of real \"letters\" and\r\nmore than any one else except Chateaubriand (more \"intensively\" perhaps\r\neven than he was) a pioneer of Romanticism--comes Charles Nodier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paul de Kock.]\r\n\r\nMajor Pendennis, in a passage which will probably, at least in England,\r\npreserve the name of the author mentioned long after his own works are\r\neven more forgotten with us than they are at present, allowed, when\r\ndisparaging novels generally, and wondering how his nephew could have\r\ngot so much money for one, that Paul de Kock \"certainly made him laugh.\"\r\nIn his own country he had an enormous vogue, till the far greater\r\nliterary powers and the wider range of the school of 1830 put the times\r\nout of joint for him, and even much later. He actually survived the\r\nTerrible Year: but something like a lustrum earlier, when running over a\r\nnot small collection of cheap novels in a French country inn, I do not\r\nremember coming across anything of his. And he had long been classed as\r\n\"not a serious person\" (which, indeed, he certainly was not) by French\r\ncriticism, not merely of the most academic sort, but of all decidedly\r\nliterary kinds. People allowed him _entrain_, a word even more difficult\r\nthan _verve_ to English exactly, though \"go\" does in a rough sort of way\r\nfor both. They were of course not very much shocked at his indecorums,\r\nwhich sometimes gave occasion for not bad jokes.[39] But if any\r\nforeigner made any great case of him they would probably have looked, if\r\nthey did not speak their thoughts, very much as some of us have looked,\r\nif we have not spoken, when foreigners take certain popular scribes and\r\nplaywrights of our own time and country seriously.[40]\r\n\r\nLet us see what his work is really like to the eyes of impartial and\r\ncomparative, if not cosmopolitan, criticism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _L'Enfant de ma Femme._]\r\n\r\nPaul de Kock, whose father, a banker, was a victim, but must have been a\r\nlate one, of the Terror, was born in 1794, and took very early to\r\nletters. If the date of his first book, _L'Enfant de ma Femme_, is\r\ncorrectly given as 1812, he must apparently have written it before he\r\nwas eighteen. There is certainly nothing either in the quantity or the\r\nquality of the performance which makes this incredible, for it does not\r\nfill quite two hundred pages of the ordinary 18mo size and not very\r\nclosely packed type of the usual cheap French novel, and though it is\r\nnot unreadable, any tolerably clever boy might easily write it between\r\nthe time when he gets his scholarship in spring and the time when he\r\ngoes up in October. The author had evidently read his Pigault and\r\nadopted that writer's revised picaresque scheme. His most prominent\r\ncharacter (the hero, Henri de Framberg, is very \"small doings\"), the\r\nhussar-soldier-servant, and most oddly selected \"governor\" of this hero\r\nas a boy, Mullern, is obviously studied off those semi-savage \"old\r\nmoustaches\" of whom we spoke in the last volume, though he is much\r\nsoftened, if not in morals, in manners. In fact this softening process\r\nis quite obvious throughout. There is plenty of \"impropriety\" but no\r\nmere nastiness, and the impropriety itself is, so to speak, rather\r\nindicated than described. As nearly the last sentence announces, \"Hymen\r\nhides the faults of love\" wherever it is possible, though it would\r\nrequire a most complicated system of polygamy and cross-unions to enable\r\nthat amiable divinity to cover them all. There is a villain, but he is a\r\nvillain of straw, and outside of him there is no ill-nature. There seems\r\nto be going to be a touch of \"out-of-boundness\" when Henri, just about\r\nto marry his beloved Pauline, is informed that she is his sister, and\r\nwhen the pair, separating in horror, meet again and, let us say, forget\r\nto separate. But the information turns out to be false, and Hymen duly\r\nuses the not uncomfortable extinguisher which, as noted above, is\r\nsupplied to him as well as the more usual torch.\r\n\r\nTo call the book good would be ridiculous, but a very large experience\r\nof first novels of dates before, the same as, and after its own may\r\nwarrant allotment to it of possibilities of future good gifts. The\r\nhistory, such as it is, runs currently; there are no hitches and stops\r\nand stagnations, the plentiful improbabilities are managed in such\r\nfashion that one does not trouble about them, and there is an\r\natmosphere, sometimes of horseplay but almost always of good humour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Petits Tableaux de Moeurs._]\r\n\r\nThe matter which, by accident or design, goes with this in mid-century\r\nreprints of Paul, is of much later date, but it shows that, for some\r\ntime, its author had been exercising himself in a way valuable to the\r\nnovelist at any time but by no means as yet frequently practised.\r\n_Petits Tableaux de Moeurs_ consists of about sixty short sketches of\r\na very few pages each (usually two or three) and of almost exactly the\r\nsame kind as those with which Leigh Hunt, a little earlier in England,\r\ntransformed the old _Spectator_ essay into the kind of thing taken up\r\nsoon afterwards by \"Boz\" and never disused since. They are sketches of\r\ntypes of men, of Parisian cafés, gardens, and restaurants; fresh\r\nhandlings of old subjects, such as the person who insists on taking you\r\nhome to a very bad \"pot-luck\" dinner, and the like. Once more, there is\r\nno great brilliance in these. But they are lightly and pleasantly done;\r\nit must be obvious to every one that they are simply invaluable training\r\nfor a novelist who is to leave the beaten track of picaresque adventure\r\nand tackle real ordinary life. To which it may be added, as at least\r\npossible, that Thackeray himself may have had the creation of Woolsey\r\nand Eglantine in _The Ravenswing_ partly suggested by a conversation\r\nbetween a tailor and a hairdresser in Paul's \"Le Banc de Pierre des\r\nTuileries.\" As this is very short it may be worth giving:\r\n\r\n     To finish our observations, my friend and I went and sat\r\n     behind two young men dressed in the extreme of the fashion,\r\n     who, with their feet placed on chairs as far as possible\r\n     from those in which they were sitting, gracefully rocked\r\n     themselves, and evidently hoped to attract general\r\n     attention.\r\n\r\n     In a minute we heard the following conversation:\r\n\r\n     \"Do you think my coat a success?\" \"Superb! delicious! an\r\n     admirable cut!\" \"And the pantaloons?\" \"Ravishing! Your get\r\n     up is really stunning.\" \"The governor told me to spend three\r\n     hours in the Grand Alley, and put myself well forward. He\r\n     wants people to take up this new shape and make it\r\n     fashionable. He has already one order of some consequence.\"\r\n     \"And, as for me, do you think my hair well done?\" \"Why, you\r\n     look like a very Adonis. By the way, _my_ hair is falling\r\n     off. Do give me something to stop that.\" \"You must give it\r\n     nourishment. You see hairs are plants or flowers. If you\r\n     don't water a flower, you can see it withering.\" \"Very true.\r\n     Then must I use pommade?\" \"Yes, but in moderation; just as a\r\n     tree too much watered stops growing. Hair is exactly like\r\n     vegetables.\" \"And both want cutting?\" \"Why, yes; it's like a\r\n     plantation; if you don't prune and thin the branches it\r\n     kills the young shoots. Cutting helps the rise of the sap.\"\r\n     \"Do you hold with false fronts?\" \"I believe you! Why, I make\r\n     them; it's just like putting a new roof on a house.\" \"And\r\n     that does no harm to one's head?\" \"Impossible! neither glue\r\n     nor white of egg, which needs must hinder growth, are used.\r\n     People who wear them mix their own hair with the front. They\r\n     are two flocks, which unite to feed together, as M. Marty\r\n     says so well in the _Solitaire_.\"[41] \"Two torrents which\r\n     join in the valley: that is the image of life!\"\r\n\r\n     We had heard enough, and so we left the tailor's young man\r\n     and the romantic hairdresser to themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Gustave._]\r\n\r\nIn _Gustave ou Le Mauvais Sujet_, a book still early but some years\r\nlater than _L'Enfant_, Paul de Kock got nearer to his proper or improper\r\nsubject--bachelor life in Paris, in the sense of his contemporary Pierce\r\nEgan's _Life in London_.[42] The hero may be called a French Tom Jones\r\nin something (but not so much as in the original phrase) of the sense in\r\nwhich Klopstock was allowed to be a German Milton. He has his Allworthy\r\nin a benevolent uncle-colonel, peppery but placable; he is far more\r\nplentifully supplied than even Tom was with persons of the other sex who\r\nplay the parts of Black George's daughter and Mrs. Waters, if not\r\nexactly of Lady Bellaston. A Sophia could hardly enter into the Kockian\r\nplan, but her place in that scheme (with something, one regrets to add,\r\nof Lady Bellaston's) is put in commission, and held by a leash of\r\namiable persons--the erring Madame de Berly, who sacrifices honour and\r\nbeauty and very nearly life for the rascal Gustave; Eugénie Fonbelle, a\r\nrich, accomplished, and almost wholly desirable widow, whom he is\r\nactually about to marry when, luckily for her, she discovers his\r\n_fredaines_, and \"calls off\"; and, lastly, a peasant girl, Suzon, whom\r\nhe seduces, whom he keeps for six weeks in his uncle's house, after a\r\nfashion possibly just not impossible in a large Parisian establishment;\r\nwho is detected at last by the uncle; who runs away when she hears that\r\nGustave is going to marry Eugénie, and who is at the end produced, with\r\nan infant ready-made, for Paul's favourite \"curtain\" of Hymen, covering\r\n(like the curtain) all faults. The book has more \"scabrous\" detail than\r\n_L'Enfant de ma Femme_, and (worse still) it relapses into\r\nSmollettian-Pigaultian dirt; but it displays a positive and even large\r\nincrease of that singular readableness which has been noticed. One would\r\nhardly, except in cases of actual novel-famine, or after an immense\r\ninterval, almost or quite involving oblivion, read a book of Paul's\r\ntwice, but there is seldom any difficulty in reading him once. Only,\r\nbeware his moral moods! When he is immoral it is in the bargain; if you\r\ndo not want him you leave him, or do not go to him at all. But when, for\r\ninstance, the unfortunate Madame de Berly has been frightfully burnt and\r\ndisfigured for life by an act of her own, intended to save--and\r\nsuccessful in saving--her _vaurien_ of a lover, Paul moralises thus at\r\nthe end of a chapter--\r\n\r\n     Julie perdit en effet tous ses attraits: elle fut punie par\r\n     où elle avait pêché. Juste retour des choses ici-bas.\r\n\r\nthere being absolutely no such _retour_ for Gustave--one feels rather\r\ninclined, as his countrymen would say, to \"conspue\" Paul.[43] It is\r\nfair, however, to say that these accesses of morality or moralising are\r\nnot very frequent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The caricatured _Anglais_.]\r\n\r\nBut there is one thing of some interest about _Gustave_ which has not\r\nyet been noticed. Paul de Kock was certainly not the author,[44] but he\r\nmust have been one of the first, and he as certainly was one of the most\r\neffective and continuous, promoters of that curious caricature of\r\nEnglishmen which everybody knows from French draughtsmen, and some from\r\nFrench writers, of the first half of the nineteenth century. It is only\r\nfair to say that we had long preceded it by caricaturing Frenchmen. But\r\nthey had been slow in retaliating, at least in anything like the same\r\nfashion. For a long time (as is again doubtless known to many people)\r\nFrench literature had mostly ignored foreigners. During the late\r\nseventeenth and earlier eighteenth centuries few, except the\r\naristocracy, of either country knew much of the other, and there was\r\ncomparatively little (of course there was always some) difference\r\nbetween the manners and customs of the upper classes of both. Prévost\r\nand Crébillon, if not Marivaux,[45] knew something about England. Then\r\narose in France a caricature, no doubt, but almost a reverential one,\r\ndue to the _philosophes_, in the drawing whereof the Englishman is\r\nindeed represented as eccentric and splenetic, but himself philosophical\r\nand by no means ridiculous. Even in the severe period of national\r\nstruggle which preceded the Revolutionary war, and for some time after\r\nthe beginning of that war itself, the scarecrow-comic _Anglais_ was slow\r\nto make his appearance. Pigault-Lebrun himself, as was noted in the last\r\nvolume, indulges in him little if at all. But things soon changed.\r\n\r\nIn the book of which we have been speaking, Gustave and a scapegrace\r\nfriend of his determine to give a dinner to two young persons of the\r\nother sex, but find themselves penniless, and a fresh edition of one of\r\nthe famous old _Repues Franches_ (which date in French literature back\r\nto Villon and no doubt earlier) follows. With this, as such, we need not\r\ntrouble ourselves. But Olivier, the friend, takes upon him the duty of\r\nproviding the wine, and does so by persuading a luckless vintner that he\r\nis a \"Milord.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to dress the part, he puts on a cravat well folded, a very long\r\ncoat, and a very short waistcoat. He combs down his hair till it is\r\nquite straight, rouges the tip of his nose, takes a whip, puts on\r\ngaiters and a little pointed hat, and studies himself in the glass in\r\norder to give himself a stupid and insolent air, the result of the\r\nmake-up being entirely successful. It may be difficult for the most\r\nunbiassed Englishman of to-day to recognise himself in this portrait or\r\nto find it half-way somewhere about 1860, or even, going back to actual\r\n\"_temp._ of tale,\" to discover anything much like it in physiognomies\r\nso different as those of Castlereagh and Wellington, of Southey and\r\nLockhart, nay, even of Tom and Jerry.[46] But that it is the Englishman\r\nof Daumier and Gavarni, _artistement complet_ already, nobody can deny.\r\n\r\nLater in the novel (before he comes to his very problematical \"settling\r\ndown\" with Suzon and the ready-made child) Gustave is allowed a rather\r\nsuperfluous scattering of probably not final wild oats in Italy and\r\nGermany, in Poland and in England. But the English meesses are too\r\n_sentimentales_ (note the change from _sensibles_); he does not like the\r\ncourses of horses, the combats of cocks, the bets and the punches and\r\nthe plum-puddings. He is angry because people look at him when he pours\r\nhis tea into the saucer. But what annoys him most of all is the custom\r\nof the ladies leaving the table after dinner, and that of preferring\r\ncemeteries for the purpose of taking the air and refreshing oneself\r\nafter business. It may perhaps diminish surprise, but should increase\r\ninterest, when one remembers that, after Frenchmen had got tired of\r\nLocke, and before they took to Shakespeare, their idea of our literature\r\nwas largely derived from \"Les Nuits de Young\" and Hervey's _Meditations\r\namong the Tombs_.\r\n\r\nAnother bit of copy-book (to revert to the Pauline moralities) is at the\r\nend of the same very unedifying novel, when the benevolent and\r\nlong-suffering colonel, joining the hands of Gustave and Suzon, remarks\r\nto the latter that she has proved to him that \"virtues, gentleness,\r\nwits, and beauty can serve as substitutes for birth and fortune.\" It\r\nwould be unkind to ask which of the \"virtues\" presided over Suzon's\r\noriginal acquaintance with her future husband, or whether the same or\r\nanother undertook the charge of that wonderful six weeks' abscondence of\r\nhers with him in this very uncle's house.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Edmond et sa Cousine._]\r\n\r\nBut no doubt this capacity for \"dropping into\" morality stood Paul in\r\ngood stead when he undertook (as it was almost incumbent on such a\r\nuniversal provider of popular fiction to do) what the French, among\r\nother nicknames for them, call _berquinades_--stories for children and\r\nthe young person, more or less in the style of the _Ami des Enfants_. He\r\ndiversified his _gauloiseries_ with these not very seldom. An example is\r\nbound up with _Gustave_ itself in some editions, and they make a very\r\nchoice assortment of brimstone and treacle. The hero and heroine of\r\n_Edmond et sa Cousine_ are two young people who have been betrothed from\r\ntheir youth up, and neither of whom objects to the situation, while\r\nConstance, the \"She-cosen\" (as Pepys puts it) is deeply in love with\r\nEdmond. He also is really fond of her, but he is a bumptious and\r\nsuperficial snob, who, not content with the comfortable[47] income which\r\nhe has, and which will be doubled at his marriage, wants to make fame\r\nand fortune in some way. He never will give sufficient scope and\r\napplication to his moderate talents, and accordingly fails very plumply\r\nin music, playwriting, and painting. Then he takes to stock-exchange\r\ngambling, and of course, after the usual \"devil's _arles_\" of success,\r\ncompletely ruins himself, owes double what he has, and is about to blow\r\nout his somewhat unimportant brains. But Constance, in the truest spirit\r\nof melodrama, and having long sought him in vain under the guidance of a\r\n_quarta persona_, of whom more presently, realises almost the whole of\r\nher fortune, except a small pittance, dashes it down before him in the\r\nnick of time, and saves him for the moment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the straitest sect of the Berquinaders would have finished the\r\nstory here, made the two marry on Constance's pittance, reconciled\r\nEdmond to honest work, and so on. Paul, however, had a soul both above\r\nand below this. Edmond, with the easy and cheap sham honour of his kind,\r\nwill not \"subject her to privations,\" still hopes for something to turn\r\nup, and in society meets with a certain family of the name of\r\nBringuesingue--a father who is a retired mustard-maker with some money\r\nand no brains, a mother who is a nonentity, and a daughter Clodora,[48]\r\na not bad-looking and not unamiable girl, unfortunately dowered with the\r\nsilliness of her father and the nullity of her mother combined and\r\nintensified. There is some pretty bad stock farce about M. Bringuesingue\r\nand his valet, whom he pays to scratch his nose when his master is\r\ncommitting solecisms; and about Edmond's adroitness in saving the\r\nsituations. The result is that the Bringuesingues throw their not\r\nunwilling daughter at Edmond's head. To do him the only justice he ever\r\ndeserves, he does not like to give up Constance; but she, more\r\nmelodramatic than ever, contrives to imbue him with the idea that she is\r\nfalse to him, and he marries Clodora. Again the thing might have been\r\nstopped; but Paul once more goes on, and what, I fear, must be called\r\nhis hopeless bad taste (there is no actual bad _blood_ in him), and the\r\nprecious stage notion that \"Tom the young dog\" may do anything and be\r\nforgiven, make him bring about a happy ending in a very shabby fashion.\r\nEdmond is bored by his stupid though quite harmless and affectionate\r\nwife, neglects her, and treats his parents-in-law with more contempt\r\nstill. Poor Clodora dies, but persuades her parents to hand over her\r\nfortune to Edmond, and with it he marries Constance. \"Hide, blushing\r\nhonour! hide that wedding-day.\" But, you see, the Paul-de-Kockian hero\r\nwas not like Lord Welter. There was hardly anything that _this_ \"fellow\r\ncouldn't do.\"\r\n\r\nPaul, however, has kept his word with his subscribers by shutting out\r\nall sculduddery, even of the mildest kind, and has, if not reconciled,\r\npartly conciliated critics by throwing in some tolerable minor\r\npersonages. Pélagie, Constance's lively friend, has a character which he\r\ncould somehow manage without Richardsonian vulgarity. Her amiable\r\nfather, an orchestra musician, who manages to find _des jolies choses_\r\neven in a damned piece, is not bad; and, above all, Pélagie's lover,\r\nand, till Edmond's misconduct, his friend, M. Ginguet--a modest\r\nGovernment clerk, who adores his mistress, is constantly snubbed by her,\r\nbut has his flames crowned at last,--is, though not a particularly novel\r\ncharacter, a very well-played part.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _André le Savoyard._]\r\n\r\nOne of the author's longer books, _André le Savoyard_, is a curious\r\nblend of the _berquinade_ with what some English critics have been kind\r\nenough to call the \"candour\" of the more usual French novel. The\r\ncandour, however, is in very small proportion to the berquinity. This, I\r\nsuppose, helped it to pass the English censorship of the mid-nineteenth\r\ncentury; for I remember a translation (it was the first book of the\r\nauthor's I ever read) far away in the 'fifties, among a collection of\r\nbooks where nothing flagrantly scabrous would have been admitted. It\r\nbegins, and for the most part continues, in an almost completely\r\nMarmontelish or Edgeworthian fashion. A selfish glutton and\r\n_petit-maître_ of a French count, M. de Francornard, loses his way (with\r\na postilion, a valet, and his little daughter, whom he has carried off\r\nfrom her mother) in the hills of Savoy, and is rescued and guested by a\r\ngood peasant, whom he rewards with a _petit écu_ (three _livres_, not\r\nfive or six). The peasant dies, and his two eldest boys set out for\r\nParis as chimney-sweeps. The elder (eleven-year-old) André himself is\r\nbefriended by a good Auvergnat water-carrier and his little daughter\r\nManette; after which he falls in with the Francornards--now, after a\r\nfashion, a united family. He is taken into their household and made a\r\nsort of protégé by the countess, the child Adolphine being also very\r\nfond of him; while, though in another way, their _soubrette_ Lucile, a\r\npretty damsel of eighteen, is fonder still. Years pass, and the\r\nfortunate André distributes his affections between the three girls.\r\nManette, though she ends as his wife, is more of a sister at first;\r\nAdolphine is an adored and unhoped-for idol; while Lucile (it is hardly\r\nnecessary to say that it is in the scenes with her that \"candour\" comes\r\nin) is at first a protectress, then a schoolmistress of the school of\r\nCupid, in process of time a mistress in the other sense, and always a\r\nvery good-natured and unselfish helper. In fact, Manette is so\r\npreternaturally good (she can't even be jealous in a sufficiently human\r\nway), Adolphine so prettily and at last tragically null, that one really\r\nfeels inclined to observe to André, if he were worth it, the recondite\r\nquotation\r\n\r\n    Ne sit ancillae tibi amor pudori,\r\n\r\nthough perhaps seven years _is_ a long interval in the first third of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Jean._]\r\n\r\nA still better instance of the modified _berquinade_--indeed, except for\r\nthe absence of riotous fun, one of the best of all Paul de Kock's\r\nbooks--is _Jean_, also an example of his middle and ripest period. If\r\ntranslated into English it might have for second title \"or, The History\r\nof a Good Lout.\" The career of Jean Durand (one of the French\r\nequivalents for John Brown or Jones or Robinson) we have from the moment\r\nof, and indeed a little before, his birth to that crowning of a virtuous\r\nyoung Frenchman's hopes, which consists in his marrying a pretty,\r\namiable, sensible, and well-to-do young widow.[49] Jean is the son of a\r\nherbalist father who is an eccentric but not a fool, and a mother who\r\nis very much of a fool but not in the least eccentric. The child, who is\r\nborn in the actual presence (result of the usual farcical opening) of a\r\ncorporal and four fusiliers, is put out to nurse at Saint-Germain in the\r\nway they did then, brought home and put out to school, but, in\r\nconsequence of his mother's absurd spoiling, allowed to learn absolutely\r\nnothing, and (though he is not exactly a bad fellow) to get into very\r\nbad company. With two of the choicest specimens of this he runs away\r\n(having, again by his mother's folly, been trusted with a round sum in\r\ngold) at the age of sixteen, and executes a sort of picaresque journey\r\nin the environs of Paris, till he is brought to his senses through an\r\nactual robbery committed by the worst of his companions. He returns home\r\nto find his father dead: and having had a substantial income left him\r\nalready by an aunt, with the practical control of his mother's\r\nresources, he goes on living entirely _à sa guise_. This involves no\r\npositive debauchery or ruination, but includes smoking (then, it must be\r\nremembered, almost as great a crime in French as in English middle-class\r\ncircles), playing at billiards (ditto), and a free use of strong drink\r\nand strong language. He spends and gives money freely, but does not get\r\ninto debt; flirts with grisettes, but falls into no discreditable\r\nentanglement, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nHis most characteristic peculiarity, however, is his absolute refusal to\r\nlearn the rudiments of manners. He keeps his hat on in all companies;\r\nneglects all neatness in dress, etc.; goes (when he _does_ go) among\r\nladies with garments reeking of tobacco and a mouth full of strange\r\noaths, and generally remains ignorant of, or recalcitrant to, every form\r\nof conventional politeness in speech and behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe only person of any sense with whom he has hitherto come in contact,\r\nan old hairdresser named Bellequeue (it must be remembered that this\r\nprofession or vocation is not as traditionally ridiculous in French\r\nliterature as in ours), persuades his mother that the one chance of\r\nreforming Jean and making him like other people is to marry him off.\r\nThey select an eligible _parti_, one Mademoiselle Adelaide Chopard, a\r\nyoung lady of great bodily height, some facial charms, not exactly a\r\nfool, but not of the most amiable disposition, and possessed of no\r\nactual accomplishment (though she thinks herself almost a \"blue\") except\r\nthat of preserving different fruits in brandy, her father being a\r\nretired liqueur manufacturer. Jean, who has never been in the least \"in\r\nlove,\" has no particular objection to Adelaide, and none at all to the\r\npreserved cherries, apricots, etc., and the scenes of his introduction\r\nand, after a fashion, proposal to the damsel, with her first resentment\r\nat his unceremonious behaviour and later positive attraction by it, are\r\nfar from bad. Luckily or unluckily--for the marriage might have turned\r\nout at least as well as most marriages of the kind--before it is brought\r\nabout, this French Cymon at last meets his real Iphigenia. Walking\r\nrather late at night, he hears a cry, and a footpad (one of his own old\r\ncomrades, as it happens) rushes past him with a shawl which he has\r\nsnatched from two ladies. Jean counter-snatches the shawl from him and\r\nsuccours the ladies, one of whom strikes his attention. They ask him to\r\nput them into a cab, and go off--grateful, but giving no address.\r\nHowever, he picks up a reticule, which the thief in his fright has\r\ndropped, discovers in it the address he wants, and actually ventures to\r\ncall on Madame Caroline Derville, who possesses, in addition to viduity,\r\nall the other attractions catalogued above.\r\n\r\nAnother scene of farce, which is not so far short of comedy, follows\r\nbetween the lout and the lady, the fun being, among other things, caused\r\nby Jean's unconventional strolling about the room, looking at\r\nengravings, etc., and showing, by his remarks on things--\"The Death of\r\nTasso,\" \"The Marriage of Peleus and Thetis,\" and the like--that he is\r\nutterly uneducated.\r\n\r\nThere is about half the book to come, but no more abstract can be\r\nnecessary. The way in which Jean is delivered from his Adelaide and\r\nrewarded with his Caroline, if not quite probable (for Adelaide is made\r\nto blacken her own character to her rival), is not without ingenuity.\r\nAnd the narrative (which has Paul de Kock's curious \"holding\" quality\r\nfor the hour or two one is likely to bestow on it) is diversified by the\r\nusual duel, by Jean's noble and rather rash conduct, in putting down his\r\npistols to bestow sacks of five-franc pieces on his two old friends (who\r\ntry to burgle and--one of them at least--would rather like to murder\r\nhim), etc., etc.[50] But the real value--for it has some--of the book\r\nlies in the vivid sketches of ordinary life which it gives. The curious\r\nCockneydom, diversified by glimpses of a suburban Arcadia, in which the\r\nFrench _bourgeois_ of the first half of the nineteenth century seems to\r\nhave passed his time; the humours of a _coucou_ journey from Paris to\r\nSaint-Germain; all sorts of details of the Durand and Chopard\r\nhouseholds--supply these. And not the least of them is given by the\r\nbachelor ménage of Bellequeue with his eighteen-year-old _bonne_ Rose,\r\nthe story whereof need not sadden or shock even Mrs. Grundy, unless she\r\nscents unrecounted, indeed not even hinted at, improprieties.\r\nBellequeue, as noted above, is by no means a fool, and achieves as near\r\nan approach to a successful \"character\" as Paul de Kock has ever drawn;\r\nwhile Rose plays the same part of piebald angel as Lucile in _André_,\r\nwith a little more cleverness in her espièglerie and at least no\r\nvouched-for unlawfulnesses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Femme, le Mari et l'Amant._]\r\n\r\nBut perhaps if any one wants a single book to judge Paul de Kock by\r\n(with one possible exception, to follow this), he cannot do better than\r\ntake _La Femme, le Mari et l'Amant_, a novel again of his middle period,\r\nand one which, if it shows some of his less desirable points, shows them\r\ncharacteristically and with comparatively little offence, while it\r\nexhibits what the shopkeepers would, I believe, call \"a range of his\r\nbest lines.\" The autobiographic hero, Paul Deligny, is one of his\r\nnearest approaches to a gentleman, yet no one can call him insipid or\r\npriggish; the heroine, Augustine Luceval, by marriage Jenneville, is in\r\nthe same way one of his nearest approaches to a lady, and, though not\r\nsuch a madcap as the similarly situated Frédérique of _Une Gaillarde_\r\n(_v. inf._), by no means mawkish. It is needless to say that these are\r\n\"l'Amant\" and \"la Femme,\" or that they are happily united at the end: it\r\nmay be more necessary to add that there is no scandal, but at the same\r\ntime no prunes and prism, earlier. \"Le Mari,\" M. Jenneville, is very\r\nmuch less of a success, being an exceedingly foolish as well as\r\nreprobate person, who not only deserts a beautiful, charming, and\r\naffectionate wife, but treats his lower-class loves shabbily, and allows\r\nhimself to be swindled and fooled to the _n_th by an adventuress of\r\nfashion and a plausible speculator. On the other hand, one of this\r\nbook's rather numerous grisettes, Ninie, is of the more if not most\r\ngracious of that questionable but not unappetising sisterhood. Dubois,\r\nthe funny man, and Jolivet, the parsimonious reveller, who generally\r\nmanages to make his friends pay the bill, are not bad common form of\r\nfarce. One of the best of Paul's own special scenes, the pancake party,\r\nwith a bevy of grisettes, is perhaps the liveliest of all such things,\r\nand, but for one piece of quite unnecessary Smollettism or Pigaulterie,\r\nneed only scandalise the \"unco guid.\" The whole has, in unusual measure,\r\nthat curious _readableness_ which has been allowed to most of our\r\nauthor's books. Almost inevitably there is a melodramatic end; but this,\r\nto speak rather Hibernically, is made up for by a minute and curious\r\naccount, at the beginning, of the actual presentation of a melodrama,\r\nwith humours of pit, box, and gallery. If the reader does not like the\r\nbook he will hardly like anything else of its author's; if he does, he\r\nwill find plenty of the same sort of stuff, less concentrated perhaps,\r\nelsewhere. But if he be a student, as well as a consumer, of the novel,\r\nhe can hardly fail to see that, at its time and in its kind, it is not\r\nso trivial a thing as its subjects and their treatment might, in the\r\nabstract, be pronounced to be by the grave and precise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mon Voisin Raymond._]\r\n\r\nYet somebody may say, \"This is all very well, but what was it that made\r\nMajor Pendennis laugh?\" Probably a good many things in a good many\r\nbooks; but I do not know any one more likely to have received that crown\r\nthan the exception above mentioned, _Mon Voisin Raymond_, which also\r\nbears (to me) the recommendation of a very competent friend of mine. My\r\nexperience is that you certainly do begin laughing at the very\r\nbeginning, and that the laughter is kept up, if not without cessation,\r\nwith very few intervals, through a remarkable series of comic scenes.\r\nThe book, in fact, is Paul de Kock's _Gilbert Gurney_, and I cannot sink\r\nthe critic in the patriot to such an extent as to enable me to put\r\nTheodore, even in what is, I suppose, his best long story, above, or\r\neven on a level with, Paul here.\r\n\r\nThe central point, as one sees almost at once, is that this Raymond (I\r\nthink we are never told his other name), a not entirely ill-meaning\r\nperson, but a _fâcheux_ of almost ultra-Molièresque strength, is\r\nperpetually spoiling his unlucky neighbour's, the autobiographic Eugène\r\nDorsan's, sport, and, though sometimes paid out in kind, bringing\r\ncalamities upon him, while at last he actually capots his friend and\r\nenemy by making him one of the _derniers_ already mentioned! This is\r\nvery bold of Paul, and I do not know any exact parallel to it. On the\r\nother hand, Eugène is consoled, not only by Raymond's death in the Alps\r\n(Paul de Kock is curiously fond of Switzerland as a place of punishment\r\nfor his bad characters), but by the final possession of a certain\r\nNicette, the very pearl of the grisette kind. We meet her in the first\r\nscene of the story, where Dorsan, having given the girl a guiltless\r\nsojourn of rescue in his own rooms, is detected and exposed to the\r\nmalice of a cast mistress by Raymond. I am afraid that Paul rather\r\nforgot that final sentence of his own first book; for though Pélagie,\r\nDorsan's erring and unpleasant wife, dies in the last chapter, I do not\r\nobserve that an actual Hymen with Nicette \"covers the fault\" which,\r\nafter long innocence, she has at last committed or permitted. But\r\nperhaps it would have been indecent to contract a second marriage so\r\nsoon, and it is only postponed to the unwritten first chapter of the\r\nmissing fifth volume.[51]\r\n\r\nThe interval between overture and finale is, as has been said or hinted,\r\nuncommonly lively, and for once, not only in the final retribution, Paul\r\nhas distributed the _peine du talion_ pretty equally between his\r\npersonages. Dorsan has already lost another grisette mistress, Caroline\r\n(for whose sake he has neglected Nicette), and a _femme du monde_, with\r\nwhom he has for a short time intrigued; while in both cases Raymond,\r\nthough not exactly the cause of the deprivation, has, in his meddling\r\nway, been mixed up with it. In yet other scenes we have a travelling\r\nmagic-lantern exhibition in the Champs Élysées; a night in the Tivoli\r\nGardens; an expedition to a party at a country house, which, of course,\r\nRaymond's folly upsets, literally as well as metaphorically; a long\r\n(rather too long) account of a musical evening at a very\r\nlower-middle-class house; a roaringly farcical interchange of dinners\r\n_en cabinet particulier_ at a restaurant, in which Raymond is the\r\nvictim. But, on the whole, he scores, and is a sort of double cause of\r\nthe hero's last and greatest misfortune. For it is a lie of his about\r\nNicette which determines Dorsan to make a long-postponed visit to his\r\nsister in the country, and submit at last to her efforts to get him\r\nmarried to the exaggeratedly _ingénue_ Pélagie, and saddled with her\r\ndetestable aunt, Madame de Pontchartrain. The end of the book is not\r\nquite equal to some other parts of it. But there is abundance of\r\nexcellent farce, and Nicette might reconcile the veriest sentimentalist.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Barbier de Paris._]\r\n\r\nAt one time in England--I cannot speak for the times of his greatest\r\npopularity in France--Paul de Kock's name, except for a vague knowledge\r\nof his grisette and _mauvais sujet_ studies, was very mainly connected\r\nwith _Le Barbier de Paris_. It was an instance of the constant mistakes\r\nwhich almost all countries make about foreign authors. I imagine, from a\r\nfresh and recent reading of it, that he probably did take more trouble\r\nwith it than with most of his books. But, unfortunately, instances of\r\nlost labour are not confined to literature. The subject and the author\r\nare very ill matched. It is a romance of 1632, and so in a way competing\r\nwith the most successful efforts of the great Romantics. But for such a\r\ntask Paul had no gifts, except his invariable one of concocting a\r\nreadable story. As for style, imagination, atmosphere, and such high\r\ngraces, it would be not so much cruel as absurd to \"enter\" the book with\r\n_Notre-Dame de Paris_ or the _Contes Drolatiques_, _Le Capitaine\r\nFracasse_ or the _Chronique de Charles IX_. But even the lower ways he\r\ncould not tread here. He did not know anything about the time, and his\r\nwicked Marquis de Villebelle is not early Louis Treize at all, but\r\nrather late Louis Quinze. He had not the gift (which Scott first showed\r\nand Dumas possessed in no small measure) of writing his conversations,\r\nif not in actual temporal colour of language, at any rate in a kind of\r\n_lingua franca_ suitable to, or at the worst not flagrantly discordant\r\nwith, _any_ particular time and _any_ particular state of manners. He\r\ncould throw in types of the kind so much admired by no less a person\r\nthan Sir Philip Sidney--a garrulous old servant, an innocent young girl,\r\na gasconading coward, a revengeful daughter of Italy, a this and that\r\nand the other. But he could neither make individual character nor vivid\r\nhistorical scene. And so the thing breaks down.\r\n\r\nThe barber-hero-villain himself is the most \"unconvincing\" of barbers\r\n(who have profited fiction not so ill in other cases), of heroes (who\r\nare too often unconvincing), and even of villains (who have rather a\r\nhabit of being so).[52] Why a man who is represented as being intensely,\r\ndiabolically, wicked, but almost diabolically shrewd, should employ, and\r\ngo on employing, as his instrument a blundering poltroon like the Gascon\r\nChaudoreille, is a question which recurs almost throughout the book,\r\nand, being unanswered, is almost sufficient to damn it. And at the end\r\nthe other question, why M. le Marquis de Villebelle--represented as,\r\nthough also a villain, a person of superior intelligence--when he has\r\ndiscovered that the girl whom he has abducted and sought to ruin is\r\nreally his daughter; when he has run upstairs to tell her, has knocked\r\nat her locked door, and has heard a heavy body splashing into the lake\r\nunder her window,--why, instead of making his way at once to the water,\r\nhe should run about the house for keys, break into the room, and at\r\nlast, going to the window, draw from the fact that \"an object shows\r\nitself at intervals on the surface, and appears to be still in a state\r\nof agitation,\" the no doubt quite logical inference that Blanche is\r\ndrowning--when, and only then, he precipitates himself after her,--this\r\nquestion would achieve, if it were necessary, the damnation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pauline grisette.]\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that Paul had no turn for melodrama, history, or tragic\r\nmatter of any kind. He wrote nearly a hundred novels, and I neither\r\npretend to have read the whole of them, nor, if I had done so, should I\r\nfeel justified in inflicting abstracts on my readers. As always happens\r\nin such cases, the feast he offers us is \"pot-luck,\" but, as too seldom\r\nhappens, the luck of the pot is quite often good. With the grisette, to\r\nwhom he did much to give a niche (one can hardly call it a shrine) in\r\nliterature, whom he celebrated so lovingly, and whose gradual\r\ndisappearance he has so touchingly bewailed, or with any feminine person\r\nof partly grisettish kind, such as the curious and already briefly\r\nmentioned heroine of _Une Gaillarde_,[53] he is almost invariably happy.\r\nThe above-mentioned Lucile is not technically a grisette (who should be\r\na girl living on her own resources or in a shop, not in service) nor is\r\nRose in _Jean_, but both have the requirements of the type--_minois\r\nchiffonné_ (including what is absolutely indispensable, a _nez\r\nretroussé_), inexhaustible gaiety, extreme though by no means\r\npromiscuous complaisance, thorough good-nature--all the gifts, in short,\r\nof Béranger's _bonne fille_, who laughs at everything, but is perfectly\r\ncapable of good sense and good service at need, and who not seldom\r\nmarries and makes as good a wife as, \"in a higher _spear_,\" the English\r\n\"garrison hack\" has had the credit of being. Quite a late, but a very\r\nsuccessful example, with the complaisance limited to strictly legitimate\r\nextent, and the good-nature tempered by a shrewd determination to avenge\r\ntwo sisters of hers who had been weaker than herself, is the Georgette\r\nof _La Fille aux Trois Jupons_, who outwits in the cleverest way three\r\nwould-be gallants, two of them her sisters' actual seducers, and\r\nextracts thumping solatia from these for their victims.[54]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Others.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the older and, I think, more famous book which\r\nsuggested the title of this--_L'Homme aux Trois Culottes_, symbolising\r\nand in a way giving a history of the times of the Revolution, the\r\nEmpire, and the Restoration, and finishing with \"July\"--seems to me\r\nagain a failure. As I have said, Paul could not manage history, least of\r\nall spread-out history like this; and the characters, or rather\r\npersonages, though of the lower and lower-middle rank, which he _could_\r\nmanage best, are to me totally uninteresting. Others may have been, or\r\nmay be, more fortunate with them.\r\n\r\nSo, too, _Le Petit Fils de Cartouche_ (which I read before coming\r\nacross its first part, _Les Enfants du Boulevard_) did not inspire me\r\nwith any desire to look up this earlier novel; and _La Pucelle de\r\nBelleville_, another of Paul's attempts to depict the unconventional but\r\nvirtuous young person, has very slight interest as a story, and is\r\ndisfigured by some real examples of the \"coarse vulgarity\" which has\r\nbeen somewhat excessively charged against its author generally. _Frère\r\nJacques_ is a little better, but not much.[55]\r\n\r\nSomething has been said of \"periods\"; but, after all, when Paul has once\r\n\"got into his stride\" there is little difference on the average. I have\r\nread, for instance, in succession, _M. Dupont_, which, even in the\r\nBelgian piracy, is of 1838, and _Les Demoiselles de Magazin_, which must\r\nbe some quarter of a century later--so late, indeed, that Madame Patti\r\nis mentioned in it. The title-hero of the first--a most respectable\r\nman--has an _ingénue_, who loves somebody else, forced upon him,\r\nexperiences more recalcitrance than is usually allowed in such cases,\r\nand at last, with Paul's usual unpoetical injustice, is butchered to\r\nmake way for the Adolphe of the piece, who does not so very distinctly\r\ndeserve his Eugénie. It contains also one Zélie, who is perhaps the\r\nauthor's most impudent, but by no means most unamusing or most\r\ndisagreeable, grisette. _Les Demoiselles de Magazin_ gives us a whole\r\nposy of these curious flower-weeds of the garden of girls--pretty,\r\nmiddling, and ugly, astonishingly virtuous, not virtuous at all, and\r\n_couci-couci_ (one of them, by the way, is nicknamed \"Bouci-Boula,\"\r\nbecause she is plump and plain), but all good-natured, and on occasion\r\nalmost noble-sentimented; a guileless provincial; his friend, who has a\r\nmania for testing his wife's fidelity, and who accomplishes one of\r\nPaul's favourite fairy-tale or rather pantomime endings by coming down\r\nwith fifteen thousand francs for an old mistress (she has lost her\r\nbeauty by the bite of a parrot, and is the mother of the\r\nextraordinarily virtuous Marie); a scapegrace \"young first\" or\r\nhalf-first; a superior ditto, who is an artist, who rejects the advances\r\nof Marie's mother, and finally marries Marie herself, etc. etc. You\r\nmight change over some of the personages and scenes of the two books;\r\nbut they are scarcely unequal in such merit as they possess, and both\r\nlazily readable in the fashion so often noted.\r\n\r\nIf any one asks where this readableness comes from, I do not think the\r\nanswer is very difficult to give, and it will of itself supply a fuller\r\nexplanation (the words apology or excuse are not really necessary) for\r\nthe space here allotted to its possessor. It comes, no doubt, in the\r\nfirst place, from sheer and unanalysable narrative faculty, the secret\r\nof the business, the mystery in one sense of the mystery in the other.\r\nBut it also comes, as it seems to me, from the fact that Paul de Kock is\r\nthe very first of French novelists who, though he has no closely woven\r\nplot, no striking character, no vivid conversation or arresting phrases,\r\nis thoroughly _real_, and in the good, not the bad, sense _quotidian_.\r\nThe statement may surprise some people and shock others, but I believe\r\nit can be as fully sustained as that other statement about the most\r\ndifferent subject possible, the _Astrée_, which was quoted from Madame\r\nde Sévigné in the last volume. Paul knew the world he dealt with as well\r\nalmost as Dickens[56] knew his very different but somewhat corresponding\r\none; and, unlike Dickens, the Frenchman had the good sense to meddle\r\nvery little[57] with worlds that he did not know. Of course it would be\r\nsimply _bête_ to take it for granted that the majority of Parisian shop-\r\nand work- and servant-girls have or had either the beauty or the\r\namiability or the less praiseworthy qualities of his grisettes. But\r\nsomehow or other one feels that the general _ethos_ of the class has\r\nbeen caught.[58] His _bourgeois_ interiors and outings have the same\r\nreal and not merely stagy quality; though his melodramatic or pantomimic\r\nendings may smack of \"the boards\" a little. The world to which he holds\r\nup the mirror may be a rather vulgar sort of Vanity Fair, but there are\r\nunfortunately few places more real than Vanity Fair, and few things less\r\nunreal than vulgarity.\r\n\r\nThe last sentence may lead to a remark of a graver kind than has been\r\noften indulged in here. Thackeray defined his own plan in _Vanity Fair_\r\nitself as at least partly an attempt to show people \"living without God\r\nin the world.\" There certainly is not much godliness in the book, but he\r\ncould not keep it out altogether; he would have been false to nature\r\n(which he never was) if he had. In Paul de Kock's extensive work, on the\r\nother hand, the exclusion is complete. It is not that there is any\r\nexpressed Voltairianism as there is in Pigault. But though the people\r\nare married in church as well as at the _mairie_, and I remember one\r\ncasual remark about a mother and her daughter going to mass, the whole\r\nspiritual region--religious, theological, ecclesiastical, and what\r\nnot--is left blank. I do not remember so much as a _curé_ figuring\r\npersonally, though there may be one. And it is worth noting that Paul\r\nwas born in 1794, and therefore passed his earliest childhood in the\r\ntime when the Republic had actually gagged, if not stifled, religion in\r\nFrance--when children grew up, in some cases at any rate, without ever\r\nhearing the name of God, except perhaps in phrases like _pardieu_ or\r\n_parbleu_. It is not my business or my intention to make reflections or\r\ndraw inferences; I merely indicate the fact.\r\n\r\nAnother fact--perhaps so obvious already that it hardly needs\r\nstating--is that Paul de Kock is not exactly the person to \"take a\r\ncourse of,\" unless under such conditions as those under which Mr.\r\nCarlyle took a course of a far superior writer, Marryat, and was (one\r\nregrets to remember) very ungrateful for the good it did him. He is\r\n(what some of his too critical countrymen have so falsely called Dumas)\r\na mere _amuseur_, and his amusement is somewhat lacking in variety.\r\nNevertheless, few critical readers[59] of the present history will, I\r\nthink, consider the space given to him here as wasted. He was a really\r\npowerful schoolmaster to bring the popular novel into still further\r\npopularity; and he made a distinct advance upon such persons as\r\nPigault-Lebrun and Ducray-Duminil--upon the former in comparative\r\ndecency, if not of subject, of expression; upon the latter in getting\r\nclose to actual life; and upon both in what may be called the\r\n_furniture_ of his novels--the scene-painting, property-arranging, and\r\ngeneral staging. This has been most unfairly assigned to Balzac as\r\noriginator, not merely in France, but generally, whereas, not to mention\r\nour own men, Paul began to write nearly a decade before the beginning of\r\nthose curious efforts, half-prenatal, of Balzac's, which we shall deal\r\nwith later, and nearly two decades before _Les Chouans_. And, horrifying\r\nas the statement may be to some, I venture to say that his mere _mise en\r\nscène_ is sometimes, if not always, better than Balzac's own, though he\r\nmay be to that younger contemporary of his as a China orange to Lombard\r\nStreet in respect of plot, character, thought, conversation, and all the\r\nhigher elements, as they are commonly taken to be, of the novel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The minors before 1830.]\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the filling-up of this chapter, as to the rank and\r\nfile of the novelists of 1800-1830, has been a matter of some difficulty\r\nin the peculiar circumstances of the case. I have, however, been enabled\r\nto read, for the first time or afresh, examples not merely of those\r\nwriters who have preserved any notoriety, but of some who have not, and\r\nto assure myself on fair grounds that I need not wait for further\r\nexploration. The authors now to be dealt with have already been named.\r\nBut I may add another novelist on the very eve of 1830, Auguste Ricard,\r\nwhose name I never saw in any history of literature, but whose work fell\r\nalmost by accident into my hands, and seems worth taking as \"pot-luck.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mme. de Montolieu--_Caroline de Lichtfield_.]\r\n\r\nIsabelle de Montolieu--a Swiss by birth but a French-woman by\r\nextraction, and Madame de Crousaz by her first marriage--was a friend of\r\nGibbon's friend Georges Deyverdun, and indeed of Gibbon himself, who,\r\nshe says, actually offered to father her novel. Odd as this seems, there\r\nreally is in _Caroline de Lichtfield_[60] not merely something which\r\ndistinguishes it from the ordinary \"sensibility\" tale of its time (it\r\nwas first printed at Lausanne in 1786), but a kind of crispness of\r\nthought now and then which sometimes does suggest Gibbon, in something\r\nthe same way as that in which Fanny Burney suggests Johnson. This is\r\nindeed mixed with a certain amount of mere \"sensibility\" jargon,[61] as\r\nwhen a lover, making a surprisingly honest confession to his beloved,\r\nobserves that he is going \"to destroy those sentiments which had made\r\nhim forget how unworthy he was of them,\" or when the lady (who has been\r\nquite guiltless, and has at last fallen in love with her own husband)\r\ntells this latter of her weakness in these very engaging words: \"Yes! I\r\ndid love Lindorf; _at least I think I recognise some relation between\r\nthe sentiments I had for him and those that I feel at present_!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its advance on \"Sensibility.\"]\r\n\r\nA kind of affection was avowed in the last volume for the \"Phoebus\" of\r\nthe \"heroics,\" and something similar may be confessed for this \"Jupiter\r\nPluvius,\" this mixture of tears and stateliness, in the Sentimentalists.\r\nBut Madame de Montolieu has emerged from the most _larmoyante_ kind of\r\n\"sensible\" comedy. If her book had been cut a little shorter, and if\r\n(which can be easily done by the reader) the eccentric survival of a\r\n_histoire_, appended instead of episodically inserted, were lopped off,\r\n_Caroline de Lichtfield_ would not be a bad story. The heroine, having\r\nlost her mother, has been brought up to the age of fifteen by an amiable\r\ncanoness, who (to speak rather Hibernically) ought to have been her\r\nmother but wasn't, because the actual mother was so much richer. She\r\nbears no malice, however, even to the father who, well preserved in\r\nlooks, manners, and selfishness, is Great Chamberlain to Frederick the\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\nThat very unsacred majesty has another favourite, a certain Count von\r\nWalstein, who is ambassador of Prussia at St. Petersburg. It pleases\r\nFrederick, and of course his chamberlain, that Caroline, young as she\r\nis, shall marry Walstein. As the girl is told that her intended is not\r\nmore than thirty, and knows his position (she has, naturally, been\r\nbrought up without the slightest idea of choosing for herself), she is\r\nnot displeased. She will be a countess and an ambassadress; she will\r\nhave infinite jewels; her husband will probably be handsome and\r\nagreeable; he will certainly dance with her, and may very possibly not\r\nobject to joining in innocent sports like butterfly-catching. So she\r\nsets off to Berlin quite cheerfully, and the meeting takes place. Alas!\r\nthe count is a \"civil count\" (as Beatrice says) enough, but he is the\r\nreverse of handsome and charming. He has only one eye; he has a huge\r\nscar on his cheek; a wig (men, remember, were beginning to \"wear their\r\nown hair\"), a bent figure, and a leaden complexion. Caroline, promptly\r\nand not unnaturally, \"screams and disappears like lightning.\" Nor can\r\nany way be found out of this extremely awkward situation. The count (who\r\nis a thoroughly good fellow) would give Caroline up, though he has\r\ntaken a great fancy to her, and even the selfish Lichtfield tries (or\r\n_says_ he tries) to alter his master's determination. But Frederick of\r\ncourse persists, and with a peculiarly Frederician enjoyment in\r\nconferring an ostensible honour which is in reality a punishment, sees\r\nthe marriage ceremony carried out under his own eye. Caroline, however,\r\nexemplifies in combination certain old adages to the effect that there\r\nis \"No will, no wit like a woman's.\" She submits quite decently in\r\npublic, but immediately after the ceremony writes a letter[62] to her\r\nhusband (whose character she has partly, though imperfectly, gauged)\r\nrequesting permission to retire to the canoness till she is a little\r\nolder, under a covert but quite clearly intelligible threat of suicide\r\nin case of refusal. There are of course difficulties, but the count,\r\nlike a man and a gentleman, consents at once; the father, _bon gré mal\r\ngré_, has to do so, and the King, a tyrant who has had his way, gives a\r\nsulky and qualified acquiescence. What follows need only be very rapidly\r\nsketched. After a little time Caroline sees, at her old-new home, an\r\nengaging young man, a Herr von Lindorf; and matters, though she is quite\r\nvirtuous, are going far when she receives an enormous epistle[62] from\r\nher lover, confessing that he himself is the author of her husband's\r\ndisfigurement (under circumstances discreditable to himself and\r\ncreditable to Walstein), enclosing, too, a very handsome portrait of the\r\ncount _as he was_, and but for this disfigurement might be still. What\r\nhappens then nobody ought to need, or if he does he does not deserve, to\r\nbe told. There is no greatness about this book, but to any one who has\r\nan eye for consequences it will probably seem to have some future in it.\r\nIt shows the breaking of the Sensibility mould and the running of the\r\nmaterials into a new pattern as early as 1786. In 1886 M. Feuillet or M.\r\nTheuriet would of course have clothed the story-skeleton differently,\r\nbut one can quite imagine either making use of a skeleton by no means\r\nmuch altered. M. Rod would have given it an unhappy ending, but one can\r\nsee it in his form likewise.[63]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Madame de Genlis _iterum_.]\r\n\r\nOf Stéphanie Félicité, Comtesse de Genlis, it were tempting to say a\r\ngood deal personally if we did biographies here when they can easily be\r\nfound elsewhere. How she became a canoness at six years old, and shortly\r\nafterwards had for her ordinary dress (with something supplementary, one\r\nhopes) the costume of a Cupid, including quiver and wings; how she\r\ncombined the offices of governess to the Orleans children and mistress\r\nto their father; how she also combined the voluptuousness and the\r\nphilanthropy of her century by taking baths of milk and afterwards\r\ngiving that milk to the poor;[64] how, rather late in life, she attained\r\nthe very Crown-Imperial of governess-ship in being chosen by Napoleon to\r\nteach him and his Court how to behave; and how she wrote infinite\r\nbooks--many of them taking the form of fiction--on education, history,\r\nreligion, everything, can only be summarised. The last item of the\r\nsummary alone concerns us, and that must be dealt with summarily too.\r\n_Mlle. de Clermont_--a sort of historico-\"sensible\" story in style, and\r\nevidently imitated from _La Princesse de Clèves_--is about the best\r\nthing she did as literature; but we dealt with that in the last\r\nvolume[65] among its congeners. In my youth all girls and some boys knew\r\n_Adèle et Théodore_ and _Les Veillées du Château_. From a later book,\r\n_Les Battuécas_, George Sand is said to have said that she learnt\r\nSocialism: and the fact is that Stéphanie Félicité had seen so much,\r\nfelt so much, read so much, and done so much that, having also a quick\r\nfeminine wit, she could put into her immense body of work all sorts of\r\ncrude second-hand notions. The two last things that I read of hers to\r\ncomplete my idea of her were _Le Comte_ _de Corke_ and _Les Chevaliers\r\ndu Cygne_, books at least possessing an element of surprise in their\r\ntitles. The first is a collection of short tales, the title-piece\r\ninspired and prefaced by an account of the Boyle family, and all rather\r\nlike a duller and more spun-out Miss Edgeworth, the common relation to\r\nMarmontel accounting for this. The concluding stories of each volume,\r\n\"Les Amants sans Amour\" and \"Sanclair,\" are about the best. _Les\r\nChevaliers du Cygne_ is a book likely to stir up the Old Adam in some\r\npersons. It was, for some mysterious reason, intended as a sort of\r\nappendix--for \"grown-ups\"--to the _Veillées du Château_, and is supposed\r\nto have incorporated parabolically many of the lessons of the French\r\nRevolution (it appeared in 1795). But though its three volumes and\r\neleven hundred pages deal with Charlemagne, and the Empress Irene, and\r\nthe Caliph \"Aaron\" (Haroun), and Oliver (Roland is dead at Roncevaux),\r\nand Ogier, and other great and beloved names; though the authoress, who\r\nwas an untiring picker-up of scraps of information, has actually\r\nconsulted (at least she quotes) Sainte-Palaye; there is no faintest\r\nflavour of anything really Carlovingian or Byzantine or Oriental about\r\nthe book, and the whole treatment is in the _pre_-historical-novel\r\nstyle. Indeed the writer of the _Veillées_ was altogether of the\r\n_veille_--the day just expired--or of the transitional and\r\nhalf-understood present--never of the past seen in some perspective, of\r\nthe real new day, or, still less, of the morrow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The minor popular novel--Ducray-Duminil--_Le Petit\r\nCarilloneur_.]\r\n\r\nThe batch of books into which we are now going to dip does not represent\r\nthe height of society and the interests of education like Madame de\r\nGenlis; nor high society again and at least strivings after the new day,\r\nlike the noble author of the _Solitaire_ who will follow them. They are,\r\nin fact, the minors of the class in which Pigault-Lebrun earlier and\r\nPaul de Kock later represent such \"majority\" as it possesses. But they\r\nought not to be neglected here: and I am bound to say that the very\r\nconsiderable trouble they cost me has not been wholly vain.[66] The\r\nmost noted of the whole group, and one of the earliest, Ducray-Duminil's\r\n_Lolotte et Fanfan_, escaped[67] a long search; but the possession and\r\ncareful study of the four volumes of his _Petit Carillonneur_ (1819)\r\nhas, I think, enabled me to form a pretty clear notion of what not\r\nmerely _Lolotte_ (the second title of which is _Histoire de Deux Enfants\r\nabandonnés dans une île déserte_), but _Victor ou L'Enfant de la Forêt_,\r\n_Cælina ou L'Enfant du Mystère_, _Jules ou le Toit paternel_, or any\r\nother of the author's score or so of novels would be like.\r\n\r\nThe book, I confess, was rather hard to read at first, for\r\nDucray-Duminil is a sort of Pigault-Lebrun _des enfants_; he writes\r\nrather kitchen French; the historic present (as in all these books)\r\nloses its one excuse by the wearisome abundance of it, and the first\r\nhundred pages (in which little Dominique, having been unceremoniously\r\ntumbled out of a cabriolet[68] by wicked men, and left to the chances of\r\ndivine and human assistance, is made to earn his living by\r\nframed-bell-ringing in the streets of Paris) became something of a\r\n_corvée_. But the author is really a sort of deacon, though in no high\r\ndivision of his craft. He expands and duplicates his situations with no\r\ninconsiderable cunning, and the way in which new friends, new enemies,\r\nand new should-be-indifferent persons are perpetually trying to find out\r\nwhether the boy is really the Dominique d'Alinvil of Marseilles, whose\r\nfather and mother have been foully made away with, or not, shows command\r\nof its own particular kind of ingenuity. Intrigues of all sorts--violent\r\nand other (for his wicked relative, the Comtesse d'Alinvil, is always\r\ntrying to play Potiphar's wife to him, and there is a certain\r\nMademoiselle Gothon who would not figure as she does here in a book by\r\nMr. Thomas Day)--beset him constantly; he is induced not merely to\r\ntrust his enemies, but to distrust his friends; there is a good deal of\r\nunderground work and of the explained supernatural; a benevolent\r\nmusician; an excellent curé; a rather \"coming\" but agreeable Adrienne de\r\nSurval, who, close to the end of the book, hides her trouble in the\r\nbosom of her aunt while Dominique presses her hand to his heart (the\r\naunt seems here superfluous), etc., etc. Altogether the book is, to the\r\nhistorian, a not unsatisfactory one, and joins its evidence to that of\r\nPigault as showing that new sources of interest and new ways of dealing\r\nwith them are being asked for and found. In filling up the map of\r\ngeneral novel-development and admitting English examples, we may assign\r\nto its author a place between Mrs. Radcliffe and the _Family Herald_:\r\nconfining ourselves to French only, he has again, like Pigault,\r\nsomething of the credit of making a new start. He may appeal to the\r\ntaste of the vulgar (which is not quite the same sort of thing as \"a\r\nvulgar taste\"), but he sees that the novel is capable of providing\r\ngeneral pastime, and he does his best to make it do so.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: V. Ducange.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _L'Artiste et le Soldat._]\r\n\r\n\"The other Ducange,\" whose patronymic appears to have been Brahain, and\r\nwho perhaps took the name of the great scholar[69] for the sake of\r\ncontrast, was even more famous for his melodramas[70] than for his\r\nfiction, one piece especially, \"Trente Ans, ou La Vie d'un Joueur,\"\r\nhaving been among the triumphs of the Porte-Saint-Martin and of\r\nFrédérick Lemaître. As a novelist he did not write for children like\r\nDucray-Duminil, and one of his novels contains a boastful preface\r\nscoffing at and glorying in the accusations of impropriety brought\r\nagainst him. I have found nothing very shocking in those books of his\r\nwhich I have read, and I certainly have not thought it necessary to\r\nextend my acquaintance in search of it. He seems to have been a\r\nquarrelsome sort of person, for he got into trouble not only with the\r\nmoralists, not only with the Restoration government, but with the\r\nAcademy, which he attacked; and he is rather fond of \"scratchy\"\r\nreferences such as \"On peut mériter encore quelque intérêt sans être un\r\nAmadis, un Vic-van-Vor [poor Fergus!], un Han, ou un Vampire.\" But his\r\nintrinsic merit as a novelist did not at first seem to me great. A book\r\nworse _charpenté_ than that just quoted from, _L'Artiste et le Soldat_,\r\nI have seldom read. The first of its five volumes is entirely occupied\r\nwith the story (not badly, though much too voluminously told) of a\r\ncaptain who has lost his leg at Waterloo, and though tended by a pretty\r\nand charming daughter, is in great straits till helped by a mysterious\r\nBlack Nun, who loves _les militaires_, and has been entrusted with money\r\nto help them by the Empress Josephine. The second, \"without with your\r\nleave or by your leave\" of any kind,[71] jumps back to give us, under a\r\ndifferent name for a long time, the early history of this captain, which\r\noccupies two whole volumes and part of a third (the fourth of the book).\r\nThen another abrupt shift introduces us to the \"artist,\" the younger\r\nbrother, who bears a _third_ name, itself explained by another jump back\r\nof great length. Then a lover turns up for Suzanne, the captain's\r\ndaughter, and we end the fifth volume with a wedding procession in ten\r\ndistinct carriages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Ludovica._]\r\n\r\n_Ludovica ou Le Testament de Waterloo_, a much later book, was, the\r\nauthor tells us, finished in June 1830 under the fiendish tyranny of\r\n\"all-powerful bigots, implacable Jesuits, and restored marquises\"; but\r\nthe glorious days of July came; a new dynasty, \"jeune, forte, sincère\"\r\n(Louis Philippe \"young and sincere\"!), was on the throne; the ship of\r\nstate entered the vast sea of liberty; France revived; all Europe seemed\r\nto start from its shroud--and _Ludovica_ got published. But the author's\r\njoy was a little dashed by the sense that, unlike its half-score of\r\nforerunners, the book had not to battle with the bigots and the Jesuits\r\nand the \"restored marquises\"--the last a phrase which has considerable\r\ncharms of suggestion.\r\n\r\nAll this, of course, has its absurd side; but it shows, by way of\r\nredemption, that Ducange, in one of the many agreeable phrases of his\r\ncountry, \"did not go to it with a dead hand.\" He seems, indeed, to have\r\nbeen a thoroughly \"live\" person, if not a very wise one: and _Ludovica_\r\nbegins with a rousing situation--a crowd and block in the streets of\r\nParis, brought about by nobody quite knows what, but ending in a\r\npistol-shot, a dead body, the flight of the assassin, the dispersal of\r\nthe crowd by the _gendarmes_, and finally the discovery by a young\r\npainter, who has just returned from seeing his mother at Versailles, of\r\na very youthful, very pretty, and very terrified girl, speaking an\r\nunknown tongue, and not understanding French, who has fled for refuge\r\ninto a dark alley ending in a flight of cellar-steps. It is to the point\r\nthat among the confused cries attending the disturbance have been some\r\nabout a girl being carried off.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that this is not unpromising, and I really think\r\n_Ludovica_ (with a caution as to the excessive prolixity of its kind and\r\ntime) might be recommended to lovers of the detective novel, of which it\r\nis a rather early sample. I have confessed, in a later chapter, that\r\nthis particular \"wanity\" is not my favourite; but I found myself getting\r\nthrough M. Victor Ducange's six volumes--burdened rather than ballasted\r\nas they are by political outbursts, rather \"thorn-crackling\" attempts at\r\nhumour, and the like--with considerably less effort than has sometimes\r\nattended similar excursions. If they had been three instead of six I\r\nhardly think I should have felt the collar at all. The superiority to\r\n_L'Artiste et le Soldat_ is remarkable. When honest Jules Janin\r\nattributed to Ducange \"une érudition peu commune,\" he must either have\r\nbeen confusing Victor with Charles, or, which is more probable,\r\nexhibiting his own lack of the quality he refers to. Ducange does quote\r\ntags of Latin: but erudition which makes Proserpine the daughter of\r\n_Cybele_, though certainly _peu commune_ in one sense, is not so in the\r\nother. The purposes and the jokes, as has been said, may bore; and\r\nthough the style is better than Ducray's, it would not of itself\r\n\"over-stimulate.\" But the man is really almost prodigal of incident, and\r\ndoes not manage it badly.\r\n\r\nHere, you have Ludovica's father and mother (the former of whom has been\r\ncrimped to perform a marriage under the impression that he is a priest,\r\nwhereas he is really a colonel of dragoons) escaping through a hole at\r\nthe back of a picture from a skylighted billiard-room. There, an\r\nenterprising young man, \"sitting out\" at a ball, to attend which he has\r\ndisguised himself, kisses his partner,[72] and by that pleasing\r\noperation dislodges half his borrowed moustache. It falls, alas! on her\r\nhand, she takes it for a spider, screams, and so attracts an unwelcome\r\npublic. Later in the same evening he finds himself shut up in the young\r\nlady's bedroom, and hears her and her mother talking secrets which very\r\nnearly concern him. The carrying off of Ludovica from Poland to Paris is\r\nvery smartly managed (I am not sure that the great Alexander or one of\r\nhis \"young men\" did not borrow some details from it for the arrest of\r\nD'Artagnan and Porthos after their return from England), and the way in\r\nwhich she and a double of hers, Trinette van Poupenheim, are mixed up is\r\nreally clever. So is the general cross-purposing. Cabmen turn up just\r\nwhen they should; and though letters dropped out of pockets are as\r\ncommon as blackberries, I know few better excuses for such carelessness\r\nthan the fact that you have pulled the letter out with a silk wrapper,\r\nwhich you proceed to fold tenderly round the beautiful neck of a damsel\r\nin a cab somewhere about midnight. A holograph will made on the eve of\r\nWaterloo and preserved for fifteen years by the faithful depositary; a\r\ngood doctor, of course; many bad Jesuits, of course; another, and this\r\ntime virtuous, though very impudent, carrying-off of the _other_ young\r\nwoman from the clutches of the hated _congréganistes_;[73] a boghei;[74]\r\na jokei; a third _enlèvement_ of the real Ludovica, who escapes by a\r\ncellar-trap; and many other agreeable things, end in the complete defeat\r\nof the wicked and the marriage of the good to the tune of _four_\r\ncouples, the thing being thus done to the last in Ducange's usual\r\nhandsome manner.[75] I do not know whether _Ludovica_ was\r\nmelodramatised. _Le Jésuite_ of the same year by Ducange and the great\r\nPixérécourt looks rather like it; and so does _Il y a Seize Ans_ of a\r\nyear later, which he seems to have written alone. But if it was not it\r\nought to have been. The half-moustache-spider-kissing-screaming scene,\r\nand the brilliant youth retreating through the laughing crowd with the\r\nother half of his decoration, might have reconciled even me to the\r\ntheatre.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Auguste Ricard--_L'Ouvreuse de Loges_.]\r\n\r\nA short account of the last novel (except _Le Solitaire_) mentioned\r\nabove must stand for sample, not merely of the dozen other works of its\r\nauthor, Auguste Ricard, but for many more advertised on the fly-leaves\r\nof this time, and long since made \"alms for oblivion.\" Their titles, _Le\r\nPortier_, _La Grisette_, _Le Marchand de Coco_, by Ricard himself, on\r\none side, _L'Homme des Ruines_, _Bleack-_ (sic) _Beard_, _La Chambre\r\nRouge_ (by a certain Dinocourt) on the other, almost tell their whole\r\nstory--the story of a range (to use English terms once more) between the\r\ncheap followers of Anne Radcliffe and G. W. M. Reynolds. _L'Ouvreuse de\r\nLoges_, through which I have conscientiously worked, inclines to the\r\nlatter kind, being anti-monarchic, anti-clerical, anti-aristocratic\r\n(though it admits that these aristocrats are terrible fellows for\r\nbehaving in a way which the _roturier_ cannot imitate, however hard he\r\ntries), and anti-things-in-general. Its title-heroine is a bad old\r\nwoman, who \"keeps the door\" in the Elizabethan sense as well as\r\ntheatrically. Its real hero is a _ci-devant_ duke; malversator under the\r\nRepublic; supposed but not real victim of the Septembriseurs; atheist;\r\nwinner and loser of several fortunes; and at last _particulier_ of Paris\r\nunder a feigned name, with an apartment full of _bric-à-brac_, a drawer\r\nfull of little packets of money, after the expenditure of the last of\r\nwhich he proposes to blow his brains out; tall man of stature and of his\r\nhands, etc., etc. The book is in a way one of purpose, inculcating the\r\ndanger of wooing opera-girls, and instancing it with three very weak\r\nyoung men, another duke, a rich young _parvenu_, and a musician. Of\r\nthese the first and the last are, with their wives, rather arbitrarily\r\nsaved from the clutches into which they have fallen, by the mysterious\r\n\"M. Luc,\" while the other comes to a very bad end. The novel, which is\r\nin five volumes, is, like most of those mentioned in this section, not\r\nof the kind that one would read by preference. But it is a very fair\r\nspecimen of the \"below stairs\" romance which sometimes prepares the way\r\nfor others, fit to take their places above stairs. And so it has its\r\nplace here.[76]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The importance of these minors not inconsiderable.]\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out more than once that though neglect of such books\r\nas these may be perfectly natural and probable in the average reader,\r\nsuch neglect--and still more any contempt of them--is, though it may not\r\nbe unnatural, utterly unscholarly and uncritical from the point of view\r\nof history. Their authors themselves learnt something from their own\r\nmistaken experiments, and their successors learnt a good deal more.\r\nThey found that \"sculduddery\" was not a necessary attraction. Ducray\r\ndoes not avail himself of it, and Ducange seems to have left it off.\r\nThey did not give up, but they came less and less to depend upon,\r\nextravagant incident, violent peripeteias, cheap supernaturalities, etc.\r\nBut the most important thing about them perhaps is the evidence they\r\ngive of learning what has been called their \"business.\" Already, to a\r\ngreat extent if not wholly, that earliest obsession and preoccupation of\r\nthe novelist--the idle anxiety to answer the question, \"How do you know\r\nall these things?\"--has begun to disappear. This is rather less the case\r\nwith another foolish fancy--the belief that it is necessary to account\r\nnot merely for what we call the consequents, but for the antecedents of\r\nall the characters (at least those of any importance) that you\r\nintroduce. There can be no doubt that this was one of the objects, as it\r\nwas part of the original cause, of the mistaken _Histoire_ system, which\r\nmade you, when or soon after you introduced a personage, \"tell us all\r\nabout it,\" as the children say, in a separate inset tale. You did not\r\nnow do this, but you made, as in the capital instance of Victor Ducange,\r\nhuge diversions, retrospects, episodes, in the body of the story itself.\r\nThis method, being much less skippable than the inset by those who did\r\nnot want it, was not likely to continue, and so applied the cure to its\r\nown ill. And yet further, as novels multiplied, the supposed necessity\r\nof very great length tended to disappear. The seven or eight volumes of\r\nthe eighteenth century, which had replaced the twelves and twenties of\r\nthe seventeenth, shrank to six (_Ludovica_), five (_L'Artiste et Le\r\nSoldat_ and _l'Ouvreuse de Loges_), four (_Le Petit Carillonneur_), and\r\nthen three or two, though later the historical kind swelled again, and\r\nthe almost invariable single volume did not establish itself till the\r\nmiddle of the century. As a consequence again of this, the enormous\r\ndelay over single situations tended, though very slowly, to disappear.\r\nIt is one of the merits of Pigault-Lebrun that he is not a great sinner\r\nin verbosity and prolixity: his contemporary minors of this volume are\r\nfar more peccant in this kind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Vicomte d'Arlincourt--_Le Solitaire_.]\r\n\r\n_Le Solitaire_ is a book which I have been \"going to read\" for some\r\nfifty years, but by some accident did not till the present occasion. I\r\nknew it generally as one of the vedettes of Romanticism, and as\r\nextremely popular in its own day: also as having been, with its author's\r\nother work in poem and play and prose fiction, the subject of some\r\nridicule. But till I read it, and some things about it, I never knew how\r\nwell it deserved that ridicule and yet how very popular it was, and how\r\nreally important is its position in the history of the Romantic\r\nmovement, and so of the French novel and French literature generally. It\r\nwas published at the end of January 1821, and at the end of November a\r\nseventh edition appeared, with an elaborate _Io Triumphe!_ from the\r\npublisher. Not only had there been those seven editions (which, it must\r\nbe remembered in fairness, represent at least seventy at the other end\r\nof the century[77]), but it had been translated into four foreign\r\nlanguages; _fourteen_ dramas had been based on it, some half of which\r\nhad been at least conditionally accepted for performance; painters of\r\ndistinction were at work on subjects from it; it had reached the stages\r\nof Madrid and of London (where one critic had called it \"a very\r\nbeautiful composition\"), while French approval had been practically\r\nunanimous. Nay, a game had been founded thereon, and--crowning, but\r\nperhaps rather ominous honour--somebody had actually published a\r\nburlesque imitation.\r\n\r\nI have seldom read greater rubbish than _Le Solitaire_. It is a\r\nhistorical-romantic story (the idolatrous preface refers both to Scott\r\nand to Byron), and bears also strong, if sometimes distinctly\r\nunfortunate, resemblances to Mrs. Radcliffe, the Germans, and\r\nChateaubriand. The scene is that of Charles the Bold's defeat at Morat:\r\nand the \"Solitary\" is Charles himself--the identification of his body\r\nafter the decisive overthrow at Nancy _was_ a little doubtful--who has\r\nhidden there partly to expiate, by good deeds, his crime of massacring\r\nthe monks of the adjoining Abbey of Underlach, and partly to avail\r\nhimself of a local tradition as to a _Fantôme Sanglant_, who haunts the\r\nneighbourhood, and can be conveniently played by the aid of a crimson\r\nmantle. The slaughter of the monks, however, is not the only event or\r\ncircumstance which links Underlach to the crimes of Charles, for it is\r\nnow inhabited by a Baron d'Herstall (whose daughter, seduced by the\r\nDuke, has died early) and his niece, Elodie de Saint-Maur, whose father,\r\na former favourite of the Burgundian, that prince has killed in one of\r\nhis fits of rage. Throw in a local priest, Anselm, and you have what may\r\nbe called the chief characters; but a good Count Ecbert de Norindall, a\r\nwicked Prince of Palzo, and divers others figure. Everybody, including\r\nthe mysterious Bleeding-Phantom-Solitary-Duke himself, falls in love\r\nwith Elodie,[78] and she is literally \"carried off\" (that is to say,\r\nshouldered) several times, once by the alarming person in the crimson\r\nshroud, but always rescued, till it is time for her to die and be\r\nfollowed by him. There are endless \"alarums and excursions\"; some of the\r\n_not_ explained supernatural; woods, caves, ruins, underground\r\npassages--entirely at discretion. Catherine Morland would have been\r\nperfectly happy with it.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, because it contains these things that it has been\r\ncalled \"rubbish.\" A book might contain them all--Mrs. Radcliffe's own\r\ndo, with the aggravation of the explained wonders--and not be that. It\r\nis because of the extraordinary silliness of the style and sentiments. I\r\nshould imagine that M. d'Arlincourt was trying to write like his brother\r\nviscount, the author of _Les Martyrs_, and a pretty mess he has made of\r\nit. \"Le char de la nuit roulait silencieux sur les plaines du ciel\" (p.\r\n3). \"L'entrée du jour venait de s'élancer radieuse du palais de\r\nl'Aurore.\" \"L'amante de l'Érèbe et la mère des Songes[79] avait achevé\r\nla moitié de sa course ténébreuse,\" etc., etc. The historic present is\r\nconstantly battling with the more ordinary tenses--the very same\r\nsentence sometimes contains both. And this half-blown bladder of a style\r\nconveys sentiments as feebly pompous as itself. The actual story, though\r\nno great thing, is, if you could strip it of its froth and fustian, not\r\nso very bad: as told it is deplorable.\r\n\r\nAt the same time its mere existence--much more the fury of acceptance\r\nwhich for the moment greeted it--shows what that moment wanted. It\r\nwanted Romance, and in default of better it took _Le Solitaire_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn occasional contrast of an almost violent kind may be permitted in a\r\nwork requiring something more than merely catalogue-composition. It can\r\nhardly be found more appropriately than by concluding this chapter,\r\nwhich began with the account of Paul de Kock, by one of Charles Nodier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nodier.]\r\n\r\nTo the student and lover of literature there is scarcely a more\r\ninteresting figure in French literary history, though there are many\r\ngreater. Except a few scraps (which, by one of the odd ways of the\r\nbook-world, actually do not appear in some editions of his _Oeuvres\r\nChoisies_), he did nothing which had the quality of positive greatness\r\nin it. But he was a considerable influence: and even more of a \"sign.\"\r\nYounger than Chateaubriand and Madame de Staël, but far older than any\r\nof the men of 1830 proper, he may be said in a way to have, in his\r\nsingle person, played in France that part of schoolmaster to\r\nRomanticism, which had been distributed over two generations and many\r\npersonalities in England; and which Germany, after a fashion, did\r\nwithout, at the cost of a few undisciplined and quickly overbloomed\r\nmaster-years. Although he was born in 1780, nine years before the\r\nRevolution itself, he underwent German and English influences early,\r\n\"took\" Wertherism, Terrorism,[80] and other maladies of that _fin de\r\nsiècle_ with the utmost facility, and produced divers ultra-Romantic\r\nthings long before 1830 itself. But he had any number of literary and\r\nother avocations or distractions. He was a kind of entomologist and\r\nbotanist, a kind of philologist (one is a little astonished to find that\r\nrather curious and very charlatanish person and parson Sir Herbert\r\nCroft, whose secretary Nodier was for a time, dignified in French books\r\nby the name of \"_philologue_ Anglais\"), a good deal more than a kind of\r\nbibliographer (he spent the last twenty years of his life as Librarian\r\nof the Arsenal), and an enthusiastic and stimulating, though not exactly\r\ntrustworthy, critic. But he concerns us here, of course, for his prose\r\nfiction, which, if not very bulky, is numerous in its individual\r\nexamples, and is animated in the best of them by a spirit almost new in\r\nFrench and, though often not sufficiently caught and concentrated,\r\npresent to almost the highest degrees in at least three examples--the\r\nlast part of _La Fée aux Miettes_, _La Légende de Soeur Béatrix_, and,\r\nabove all, _Inès de las Sierras_.\r\n\r\nFor those who delight in literary filiations and genealogies, the kind\r\nof story in which Nodier excelled (and in which, though some of his own\r\nwere written after 1830, he may truly be considered as \"schoolmaster\" to\r\nMérimée and Gautier and Gérard de Nerval and all their fellows), may be,\r\nwithout violence or exaggeration, said to be a new form of the French\r\nfairy-tale, divested of common form, and readjusted with the help of the\r\nGerman _Märchen_ and fantasy-pieces. _Le Diable Amoureux_ had, no doubt,\r\nset the fashion of this kind earlier; but that story, charming as it is,\r\nis still scarcely \"Romantic.\" Nodier is so wholly; and it is fair to\r\nremember that Hoffmann himself was rather a contemporary of his, and\r\nsubject to the same influences, than a predecessor.[81]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His short stories.]\r\n\r\nThe best collection of Nodier's short tales contains nine pieces:\r\n_Trilby_, _Le Songe d'Or_, _Baptiste Montauban_, _La Fée aux Miettes_,\r\n_La Combe de l'Homme mort_, _Inès de las Sierras_, _Smarra_, _La\r\nNeuvaine de la Chandeleur_, and _La Légende de Soeur Béatrix_. Of\r\nthese I believe _Trilby_, _La Fée aux Miettes_, and _Smarra_ have been\r\nthe greatest favourites, and were pretty certainly the most influential\r\nin France. My own special delights are _Le Songe d'Or_, _Inès de las\r\nSierras_, and _Soeur Béatrix_, with part of the _Fée_. But none is\r\nwithout its attractions, and the Preface to the _Fée aux Miettes_, which\r\nis almost a separate piece, has something of the quintessential in that\r\ncurious quality which Nodier possesses almost alone in French or with\r\nGérard de Nerval and Louis Bertrand only. English readers may \"perceive\r\na good deal of [Charles] Lamb in it,\" with touches of Sterne and De\r\nQuincey and Poe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Trilby._]\r\n\r\nIt is much to be feared that more people in England nowadays associate\r\nthe name of \"Trilby\" with the late Mr. Du Maurier than with Nodier, and\r\nthat more still associate it with the notion of a hat than with either\r\nof the men of genius who used it in literature.\r\n\r\n    So mighty Byron, dead and turned to clay,\r\n    Gave name to collars for full many a day;\r\n    And Ramillies, grave of Gallic boasts so big,\r\n    Found most perpetuation in a wig.[82]\r\n\r\nThe original story united divers attractions for its first readers in\r\n1822, combining the older fashion of Ossian with the newer one of Scott,\r\ninfusing the supernatural, which was one great bait of the coming\r\nRomanticism, and steeping the whole cake in the tears of the newer\r\nrather than the older \"Sensibility.\" \"Trilby, le Lutin d'Argaïl\"[83]\r\n(Nodier himself explains that he alters the spelling here with pure\r\nphonetic intent, so as to keep the pronunciation for French eyes _and_\r\nears[84]), is a spirit who haunts the cabin of the fisherman Dougal to\r\nmake a sort of sylph-like love to his wife Jeannie. He means and does no\r\nharm, but he is naturally a nuisance to the husband, on whom he plays\r\ntricks to keep him away from home, and at length rather frightens the\r\nwife. They procure, from a neighbouring monastery, a famous exorcist\r\nmonk, who, though he cannot directly punish Trilby, lays on him sentence\r\nof exclusion from the home of the pair, unless one of them invites him,\r\nunder penalty of imprisonment for a thousand years. How the story turns\r\nto Jeannie's death and Trilby's duress can be easily imagined, and may\r\nbe read with pleasure. I confess that to me it seems pretty, but just a\r\nlittle mawkish.[85] Perhaps I am a brute.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Songe d'Or._]\r\n\r\n_Le Songe d'Or_, on the other hand, though in a way tragic, and capable\r\nof being allegorised almost _ad infinitum_ in its sense of some of the\r\nriddles of the painful earth, is not in the least sentimental, and is\r\ntold, till just upon the end, with a certain tender irony. The author\r\ncalled it \"Fable Levantine,\" and the venerable Lo[c]kman is introduced\r\nin it. But I have read it several times without caring (perhaps this was\r\nreprehensible) to ascertain whether it is in the recognised Lokman bunch\r\nor not. All I know is that here Nodier and not Lokman has told it, and\r\nthat the result is delightful. First a beautiful \"kardouon,\" the\r\nprettiest of lizards, all azure and ruby and gold, finds in the desert a\r\nheap of gold-pieces. He breaks his teeth on them, but is sure that such\r\nnice-looking things must be good to eat--probably slices of a root which\r\nsome careless person has left too long in the sun--and that, if properly\r\ntreated, they will make a famous winter provision. So he conveys them\r\nwith much care and exertion, one by one, to a soft bed of fresh moss,\r\njust the thing to catch the dew, under the shadow of a fine old tree.\r\nAnd, being naturally tired, he goes to sleep beside them. And this is\r\nthe history of the kardouon.\r\n\r\nNow there was in that neighbourhood a poor woodcutter named\r\nXaïloun--deformed, and not much more than half-witted, but amiable--who\r\nhad taken a great fancy to the kardouon as being a beautiful beast, and\r\nlikely to make a charming friend. But the kardouon, after the manner of\r\nshy lizards, had by no means reciprocated this affection, and took\r\nshelter behind stones and tree-stumps when advances were made to him. So\r\nthat the children, and even his own family, including his mother, used\r\nto jeer at Xaïloun and tell him to go to his friend. On this particular\r\noccasion, the day after the kardouon's _trouvaille_, Xaïloun actually\r\nfound the usually wide-awake animal sleeping. And as the place, with the\r\nmoss and the great tree-shadow and a running stream close by, was very\r\nattractive, Xaïloun lay down by the lizard to wait till he should wake.\r\nBut as he himself might go to sleep, and the animal, accustomed to the\r\nsun, might get a chill in the shade, Xaïloun put his own coat over him.\r\nAnd he too slept, after thinking how nice the kardouon's friendship\r\nwould be when they _both_ woke. And this is the history of Xaïloun.\r\n\r\nNext day again there came a fakir named Abhoc, who was on a pretended\r\npilgrimage, but really on the look-out for what he might get. He saw a\r\nwindfall at once, was sure that neither of its sleeping guardians could\r\nkeep it from him, and very piously thanked the Almighty for rewarding\r\nhis past devotion and self-sacrifice by opening a merry and splendid\r\nlife to him. But as, with such custodians, the treasure could be\r\n\"lifted\" without the slightest difficulty, he too lay down by it, and\r\nwent to sleep, dreaming of Schiraz wine in golden cups and a harem\r\npeopled with mortal houris. And this is the history of the fakir Abhoc.\r\n\r\nA day and a night passed, and the morrow came. Again there passed a wise\r\ndoctor of laws, Abhac by name, who was editing a text to which a hundred\r\nand thirty-two different interpretations had been given by Eastern Cokes\r\nand Littletons. He had just hit upon the hundred and thirty-third--of\r\ncourse the true one--when the sight described already struck him and put\r\nthe discovery quite out of his head, to be lost for ever. As became a\r\njurist, he was rather a more practical person than the woodcutter or the\r\nfakir, if not than the lizard. His human predecessors were, evidently,\r\nthieves, and must be brought to justice, but it would be well to secure\r\n\"pieces of conviction.\" So he began to wrap up the coins in his turban\r\nand carry them away. But there were so many, and it was so heavy, that\r\nhe grew very weary. So he too laid him down and slept. And this is the\r\nhistory of the doctor Abhac.\r\n\r\nBut on the fifth day there appeared a much more formidable person than\r\nthe others, and also a much more criminous. This was the \"King of the\r\nDesert\"--bandit and blackmailer of caravans. Being apparently a bandit\r\nof letters, he reflected that, though lizards, being, after all,\r\nminiature dragons, were immemorial guardians of treasure, they could not\r\nhave any right in it, but were most inconveniently likely to wake if any\r\nnoise were made. The others were three to one--too heavy odds by\r\ndaylight. But if he sat down by them till night came he could stab them\r\none by one while they were asleep, and perhaps breakfast on the\r\nkardouon--said to be quite good meat. And he went to sleep himself. And\r\nthis is the history of the King of the Desert.\r\n\r\nBut next day again the venerable Lokman passed by, and _he_ saw that the\r\ntree was a upas tree and the sleepers were dead. And he understood it\r\nall, and he passed his hand through his beard and fell on his face, and\r\ngave glory to God. And then he buried the three covetous ones in\r\nseparate graves under the upas itself. But he put Xaïloun in a safer\r\nplace, that his friends might come and do right to him; and he buried\r\nthe kardouon apart on a little slope facing the sun, such as lizards\r\nlove, and near Xaïloun. And, lastly, having stroked his beard again, he\r\nburied the treasure too. But he was very old: and he was very weary when\r\nhe had finished this, and God took him.\r\n\r\nAnd on the seventh day there came an angel and promised Xaïloun\r\nParadise, and made a mark on his tomb with a feather from his own wing.\r\nAnd he kissed the forehead of Lokman and made him rise from the dead,\r\nand took him to the seventh heaven itself. And this is the history of\r\nthe angel. It all happened ages ago, and though the name of Lokman has\r\nlived always through them, so has the shadow of the upas tree.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the history of the world.\r\n\r\nOnly a child's goody-goody tale? Possibly. But for my part I know no\r\nbetter philosophy and, at least as Nodier told it, not much better\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minors.]\r\n\r\n_Baptiste Montauban_ and _La Combe de l'Homme mort_ are, though scarcely\r\nshorter than _Le Songe d'Or_, slighter. The first is a pathetic but not\r\nquite consummate story of \"love and madness\" in a much better sense than\r\nthat in which Nodier's eccentric employer, Sir Herbert Croft, used the\r\nwords as his title for the history of Parson Hackman and Miss Ray.[86]\r\nThe second (\"combe,\" the omission of which from the official French\r\ndictionaries Nodier characteristically denounces, is our own \"combe\"--a\r\ndeep valley; from, I suppose, the Celtic Cwm; and pronounced by\r\nDevonshire folk in a manner which no other Englishman, born east of the\r\nline between the mouths of the Parret and the Axe, can master) is a\r\ngood but not supreme _diablerie_ of a not uncommon kind. _La Neuvaine de\r\nla Chandeleur_ is longer, and from some points of view the most pathetic\r\nof all. A young man, hearing some girls talk of a much-elaborated\r\nceremony like those of Hallowe'en in Scotland and of St. Agnes' Eve in\r\nKeats, by which (in this case) _both_ sexes can see their fated lovers,\r\ntries it, and discerns, in dream or vision, his ideal as well as his\r\nfate. She turns out to be an actual girl whom he has never seen, but\r\nwhom both his father and her father--old friends--earnestly desire that\r\nhe should marry. He travels to her home, is enthusiastically greeted,\r\nand finds her even more bewitching than her wraith or whatever it is to\r\nbe called. But she is evidently in bad health, and dies the same night\r\nof aneurism. Not guested in the house, but trysted in the morning, he\r\ngoes there, and seeing preparations in the street for a funeral, asks of\r\nsome one, being only half alarmed, \"_Qui est mort?_\" The answer is,\r\n\"Mademoiselle Cecile Savernier.\"\r\n\r\nHad these words terminated the story it would have been nearly perfect.\r\nTwo more pages of the luckless lover's progress to resignation from\r\ndespair and projected suicide seem to me to blunt the poignancy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Fée aux Miettes._]\r\n\r\nIn fact, acknowledging most humbly that I could not write even the worst\r\nand shortest of Nodier's stories, I am bound to say that I think he was\r\nnot to be trusted with a long one. _La Fée aux Miettes_ is at once an\r\nawful and a delightful example. The story of the mad shipwright Michel,\r\nwho fell in love with the old dwarf beggar--so unlike her of Bednal\r\nGreen or King Cophetua's love--at the church door of Avranches; who\r\nfollowed her to Greenock and got inextricably mixed between her and the\r\nQueen of Sheba; who for some time passed his nights in making love to\r\nBelkis and his days in attending to the wisdom of the Fairy of the\r\nCrumbs (she always brought him his breakfast after the Sabaean Nights);\r\nwho at last identified the two in one final rapture, after seeking for a\r\nSinging Mandrake; and who spent the rest (if not, indeed, the whole) of\r\nhis days in the Glasgow Lunatic Asylum;--is at times so ineffably\r\ncharming that one is almost afraid oneself to repeat the refrain--\r\n\r\n      C'est moi, c'est moi, c'est moi!\r\n        Je suis la Mandragore!\r\n    La fille des beaux jours qui s'éveille à l'aurore--\r\n          Et qui chante pour toi!\r\n\r\nthough, after all, every one whose life has been worth living has\r\nlistened for the song all that life--and has heard it sometimes.\r\n\r\nTo find any fault with the matrix of this opal is probably blasphemous.\r\nBut I own that I could do without the Shandean prologue and epilogue of\r\nthe narrator and his man-servant Daniel Cameron. And though, as a\r\ntomfool myself, I would fain not find any of the actions of my kind\r\nalien from me, I do find some of the tomfoolery with which Nodier has\r\nseasoned the story superfluous. Why call a damsel \"Folly Girlfree\"? What\r\nwould a Frenchman say if an English story-teller christened some girl of\r\nGaul \"Sottise Librefille\"? \"Sir Jap Muzzleburn,\" the Bailiff of the Isle\r\nof Man, and his black poodle-equerry, Master Blatt, amuse me but little;\r\nand Master Finewood, the shipbuilder,--whose rejected six sons-in-law,\r\nlairds of high estate, run away with his thirty thousand guineas, and\r\nare checkmated by six sturdy shipwrights,--less. I have no doubt it is\r\nmy fault, my very great fault, but I wish they would _go_, and leave me\r\nwith Michel and La Fée, or rather allow me to _be_ Michel _with_ La Fée.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Smarra_ and _Soeur Béatrix_.]\r\n\r\n_Smarra_--which made a great impression on its contemporaries and had a\r\nstrong influence on the Romantic movement generally--is a fantasia of\r\nnightmare based on the beginning of _The Golden Ass_, with, again, a\r\nsort of prologue and epilogue of modern love. It is undoubtedly a fine\r\npiece of work of its kind and beautifully written. But in itself it\r\nseems to me a little too much of a _tour de force_, and its kind a\r\nlittle rococo. Again, _mea maxima culpa_ perhaps. On the other hand,\r\n_Soeur Béatrix_ is a most charmingly told version of a very\r\nwide-spread story--that of Our Lady taking the place of an erring sister\r\nduring her sojourn in the world, and restoring her to it without any\r\nscandal when she returns repentant and miserable after years of absence.\r\nIt could not be better done.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Inès de las Sierras._]\r\n\r\nBut the jewel of the book, and of Nodier's work, to me, is _Inès de las\r\nSierras_--at least its first and larger part; for Nodier, in one of\r\nthose exasperatingly uncritical whims of his which have been noticed,\r\nand which probably prevented him from ever writing a really good novel\r\nof length, has attached an otiose explanation _à la_ Mrs. Radcliffe,\r\nwhich, if it may please the weakest kind of weak brethren, may almost\r\ndisgust another, and as to which I myself exercise the critic's\r\n_cadi_-rights by simply ignoring and banishing what I think superfluous.\r\nAs for what remains, once more, it could not be done better.\r\n\r\nThree French officers, at the moment of disturbance of the French\r\ngarrisons in the north of Spain, owing to Napoleon's Russian disasters\r\n(perhaps also to more local events, which it was not necessary for\r\nNodier to mention), are sent on remount duty from Gerona to Barcelona,\r\nwhere there is a great horse-fair on. They are delayed by bad weather\r\nand other accidents, and are obliged to stop half-way after nightfall.\r\nBut the halting-place is choke-full of other travellers on their way to\r\nthe same fair, and neither at inn nor in private house is there any room\r\nwhatever, though there is no lack of \"provant.\" Everybody tells them\r\nthat they can only put up at \"the castle of Ghismondo.\" Taking this for\r\na Spanish folkword, they get rather angry. But, finding that there _is_\r\na place of the name close by in the hills--ruinous, haunted, but\r\nactual--they take plenty of food, wine, and torches, etc., and persuade,\r\nwith no little difficulty, their _arriero_ and even their companion and\r\nthe real hirer of the vehicle (a theatrical manager, who has allowed\r\nthem to accompany him, when they could get no other) to dare the night\r\nadventure. On the way the _arriero_ tells them the legend, how,\r\ncenturies before, Ghismondo de las Sierras, ruined by debauchery,\r\nestablished himself in this his last possession, with one squire, one\r\npage (both of the worst characters), his beautiful niece Inès, whom he\r\nhas seduced, and a few desperate followers, who help him to live by\r\nbrigandage. Every night the three chiefs drank themselves senseless, and\r\nwere regularly dragged to bed by their men. But one Christmas Eve at\r\nmidnight, Inès, struck with remorse, entered the hall of orgies, and\r\nimplored them to repent, actually kneeling before Ghismondo, and placing\r\nher hand on his heart. To which the ruffian replied by stabbing her, and\r\nleaving her for the men-at-arms to find, a corpse, among the drunken but\r\nlive bodies. For a whole twelvemonth the three see, in dreams, their\r\nvictim come and lay a burning hand on their hearts; and at its end, on\r\nthe same day and at the same hour, the dream comes true--the phantom\r\nappears, speaks _once_, \"Here am I!\" sits with them, eats and drinks,\r\neven sings and dances, but finally lays the flaming hand of the dream on\r\neach heart; and they die in torture--the men-at-arms entering as usual,\r\nonly to find _four_ corpses. (Now it is actually Christmas Eve--the\r\nSpanish _Noche Buena_--at \"_temp._ of tale.\")\r\n\r\nSo far the story, though admirably told, in a fashion which mere summary\r\ncannot convey, is, it may be said, not more than \"as per usual.\" Not so\r\nwhat follows.\r\n\r\nThe four travellers--the unnamed captain who tells the story; his two\r\nlieutenants, Boutraix, a bluff Voltairian, with an immense capacity for\r\nfood and drink, and Sergy, a young and romantic Celadon, _plus_ the\r\nactor-manager Bascara, who is orthodox--with the _arriero_, arrive at\r\nlast at the castle, which is Udolphish enough, and with some difficulty\r\nreach, over broken staircases and through ruined corridors, the great\r\nbanqueting-hall.[87]\r\n\r\nHere--for it is less ruinous that the rest of the building and actually\r\ncontains furniture and mouldering pictures--they make themselves\r\ntolerably comfortable with their torches, a huge fire made up from\r\nbroken stairs and panels, abundance of provisions, and two dozen of\r\nwine, less a supply for the _arriero_, who prudently remains in the\r\nstables, alleging that the demons that haunt those places are fairly\r\nfamiliar to him and not very mischievous. As the baggage has got very\r\nwet during the day, the dresses and properties of Bascara's company are\r\ntaken out and put to air. Well filled with food and drink, the\r\nfree-thinker Boutraix proposes that they shall equip themselves from\r\nthese with costumes not unsuitable to the knight, squire, and page of\r\nthe legend, and they do so, Bascara refusing to take part in the game,\r\nand protesting strongly against their irreverence. At last midnight\r\ncomes, and they cry, \"Where is Inès de las Sierras?\" lifting their\r\nglasses to her health. Suddenly there sounds from the dark end of the\r\ngreat hall the fateful \"Here am I!\" and there comes forward a figure in\r\na white shroud, which seats itself in the vacant place assigned by\r\ntradition to Inès herself. She is extraordinarily beautiful, and is,\r\nunder the white covering, dressed in a fashion resembling the mouldering\r\nportrait which they have seen in the gallery. She speaks too, half\r\nrallying them, as if surprised at _their_ surprise; she calls herself\r\nInès de las Sierras; she throws on the table a bracelet with the family\r\narms, which they have also seen dimly emblazoned or sculptured about the\r\ncastle; she eats; and, as a final piece of conviction, she tears her\r\ndress open and shows the scar on her breast. Then she drinks response to\r\nthe toast they had in mockery proposed; she accepts graciously the\r\nadvances of the amorous Sergy; she sings divinely, and she dances more\r\ndivinely still. The whole scene is described supremely well, but the\r\ndescription of the dance is one of the very earliest and very finest\r\npieces of Romantic French prose. One may try, however rashly, to\r\ntranslate it:\r\n\r\n     (_She has found a set of castanets in her girdle._)\r\n\r\n     She rose and made a beginning by grave and measured steps,\r\n     displaying, with a mixture of grace and majesty, the\r\n     perfection of her figure and the nobility of her attitudes.\r\n     As she shifted her position and put herself in new aspects,\r\n     our admiration turned to amazement, as though another and\r\n     another beautiful woman had come within our view, so\r\n     constantly did she surpass herself in the inexhaustible\r\n     variety of her steps and her movements. First, in rapid\r\n     transition, we saw her pass from a serious dignity to\r\n     transports of pleasure, at first moderate, but growing more\r\n     and more animated; then to soft and voluptuous languors;\r\n     then to the delirium of joy, and then to some strange\r\n     ecstasy more delirious still. Next, she disappeared in the\r\n     far-off darkness of the huge hall, and the clash of the\r\n     castanets grew feeble in proportion to the distance, and\r\n     diminished ever till, as we ceased to see, so we ceased to\r\n     hear her. But again it came back from the distance,\r\n     increasing always by degrees, till it burst out full as she\r\n     reappeared in a flood of light at the spot where we least\r\n     expected her. And then she came so near that she touched us\r\n     with her dress, clashing the castanets with a maddening\r\n     volubility, till they weakened once more and twittered like\r\n     cicalas, while now and then across their monotonous racket\r\n     she uttered shrill yet tender cries which pierced to our own\r\n     souls. Afterwards she retired once more, but plunged herself\r\n     only half in the darkness, appearing and disappearing by\r\n     turns, now flying from our gaze and now desiring to be\r\n     seen,[88] while later still you neither saw nor heard her\r\n     save for a far-off plaintive note like the sigh of a dying\r\n     girl. And we remained aghast, throbbing with admiration and\r\n     fear, longing for the moment when her veil, fluttering with\r\n     the dance-movement, should be lighted up by the torches,\r\n     when her voice should warn us of her return, with a joyful\r\n     cry, to which we answered involuntarily, because it made us\r\n     vibrate with a crowd of secret harmonies. Then she came\r\n     back; she spun round like a flower stripped from its stalk\r\n     by the wind; she sprang from the ground as if it rested only\r\n     with her to quit earth for ever; she dropped again as if it\r\n     was only her will which kept her from touching it at all;\r\n     she did not bound from the floor--you would have thought\r\n     that she shot from it--that some mysterious law of her\r\n     destiny forbade her to touch it, save in order to fly from\r\n     it. And her head, bent with an expression of caressing\r\n     impatience, and her arms, gracefully opened, as though in\r\n     appealing prayer, seemed to implore us to save her.\r\n\r\nThe captain himself is on the point of yielding to the temptation, but\r\nis anticipated by Sergy, whose embrace she returns, but sinks into a\r\nchair, and then, seeming to forget the presence of the others\r\naltogether, invites him to follow her through tortuous and ruined\r\npassages (which she describes) to a sepulchre, which she inhabits, with\r\nowls for her only live companions. Then she rises, picks up her\r\nshroud-like mantle, and vanishes in the darkness with a weird laugh and\r\nthe famous words, \"_Qui m'aime me suive_.\"\r\n\r\nThe other three have the utmost difficulty in preventing Sergy (by main\r\nforce at first) from obeying. And the captain tries rationalism,\r\nsuggesting first that the pretended Inès is a bait for some gang of\r\nassassins or at least brigands, then that the whole thing is a trick of\r\nBascara's to \"produce\" a new cantatrice. But Boutraix, who has been\r\nentirely converted from his Voltairianism by the shock, sets aside the\r\nfirst idea like a soldier, and Bascara rebuts the second like a sensible\r\nman. Brigands certainly would give no such warning of their presence,\r\nand a wise manager does not expose his prima donna's throat to\r\ncohabitation in ruins with skeletons and owls. They finally agree on\r\nsilence, and shortly afterwards the three officers leave Spain. Sergy is\r\nkilled at Lutzen, murmuring the name of Inès. Boutraix, who has never\r\nrelapsed, takes the cowl, and the captain retires after the war to his\r\nown small estate, where he means to stay. He ends by saying _Voilà\r\ntout_.\r\n\r\nAlas! it is not all, and it is not the end. Some rather idle talk with\r\nthe auditors follows, and then there is the above-mentioned Radcliffian\r\nexplanation, telling how Inès was a real Las Sierras of a Mexican\r\nbranch, who had actually made her début as an actress, had been, as was\r\nat first thought, murdered by a worthless lover, but recovered. Her\r\nwits, however, were gone, and having escaped from the kind restraint\r\nunder which she was put, she had wandered to the castle of her\r\nancestors, afterwards completely recovering her senses and returning to\r\nthe profession in the company of Bascara himself.\r\n\r\nNow I think that, if I took the trouble to do so, I could point out\r\nimprobabilities in this second story sufficient to damn it on its own\r\nshowing.[89] But, as has been said already, I prefer to leave it alone.\r\nI never admired George Vavasour in Trollope's _Can You Forgive Her?_ But\r\nI own that I agree with him heartily in his opinion that \"making a\r\nconjurer explain his tricks\" is despicably poor fun.\r\n\r\nStill, the story, which ends at \"Voilà tout\" and which for me does so\r\nend \"for good and all,\" is simply magnificent. I have put it elsewhere\r\nwith _Wandering Willie's Tale_, which it more specially resembles in the\r\nway in which the ordinary turns into the extraordinary. It falls short\r\nof Scott in vividness, character, manners, and impressiveness, but\r\nsurpasses him in beauty[90] of style and imagery. In particular, Nodier\r\nhas here, in a manner which I hardly remember elsewhere, achieved the\r\nblending of two kinds of \"terror\"--the ordinary kind which, as it is\r\ntrivially called, \"frightens\" one, and the other[91] terror which\r\naccompanies the intenser pleasures of sight and sound and feeling, and\r\nheightens them by force of contrast. The scene of Inès' actual\r\nappearance would have been the easiest thing in the world to spoil, and\r\ntherefore was the most difficult thing in the world to do right. But it\r\nis absolutely right. In particular, the way in which her conduct in at\r\nonce admitting Sergy's attentions, and finally inviting him to \"follow,\"\r\nis guarded from the very slightest suggestion of the professional\r\n\"comingness\" of a common courtesan, and made the spontaneous action of a\r\nthing divine or diabolic, is really wonderful.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the adverse criticism made here, with that on _La Fée\r\naux Miettes_ and a few other foregoing remarks, will probably prepare\r\nthe reader for the repeated and final judgment that Nodier was very\r\nunlikely to produce a good long story. And, though I have not read\r\n_quite_ all that he wrote, I certainly think that he never did.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nodier's special quality.]\r\n\r\nIn adding new and important masterpieces to the glittering chain of\r\nshort cameo-like narratives which form the peculiar glory of French\r\nliterature, he did greatly. And his performance and example were greater\r\nstill in respect of the _quality_ which he infused into those best\r\npieces of his work which have been examined here. It is hardly too much\r\nto say that this quality had been almost dormant--a sleeping beauty\r\namong the lively bevies of that literature's graces--ever since the\r\nMiddle Ages, with some touches of waking--hardly more than motions in a\r\ndream--at the Renaissance. The comic Phantasy had been wakeful and\r\nactive enough; the graver and more serious tragic Imagination had been,\r\nthough with some limitations, busy at times. But this third sister--Our\r\nLady of Dreams, one might call her in imitation of a famous fancy--had\r\nnot shown herself much in French merriment or in French sadness: the\r\nlight of common day there had been too much for her. Yet in Charles\r\nNodier she found the magician who could wake her from sleep: and she\r\ntold him what she had thought while sleeping.[92]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] Vol. I. pp. 458, 472, _notes_.\r\n\r\n[38] Vol. I. p. 161.\r\n\r\n[39] When he published _Le Cocu_, it was set about that a pudibund lady\r\nhad asked her book-seller for \"Le Dernier de M. Paul de Kock.\" And this\r\ncircumlocution became for a time popular, as a new name for the poor\r\ncreature on the ornaments of whose head our Elizabethans joked so\r\nuntiringly.\r\n\r\n[40] A short essay, or at least a \"middle\" article, might be written on\r\nthis way of regarding a prophet in his own country, coupling Béranger\r\nwith Paul de Kock. Of course the former is by much a _major_ prophet in\r\nverse than Paul is in prose. But the attitude of the superior French\r\nperson to both is, in different degrees, the same. (Thackeray in the\r\narticle referred to below, p. 62 _note_, while declaring Paul to be\r\n_the_ French writer whose works are best known in England, says that his\r\neducated countrymen think him _pitoyable_.--_Works_, Oxford edition,\r\nvol. ii p. 533.)\r\n\r\n[41] A gibe at the Vicomte d'Arlincourt's very popular novel, to be\r\nnoticed below. I have not, I confess, identified the passage: but it may\r\nbe in one of the plays.\r\n\r\n[42] It would _not_ be fair to compare the two as makers of literature.\r\nIn that respect Theodore Hook is Paul's Plutarchian parallel, though he\r\nhas more literature and less life.\r\n\r\n[43] Charity, outrunning knowledge, may plead \"Irony perhaps?\"\r\nUnfortunately there is no chance of it.\r\n\r\n[44] I really do not know who was (see a little below). Parny in his\r\nabsurd _Goddam!_ (1804) has something of it.\r\n\r\n[45] And _he_ knew something of it through Addison.\r\n\r\n[46] The straight hair is particularly curious, for, as everybody who\r\nknows portraits of the early nineteenth century at all is aware,\r\nEnglishmen of the time preferred brushed back and rather \"tousled\"\r\nlocks. In Maclise's famous \"Fraserians\" there is hardly a\r\nstraight-combed head among all the twenty or thirty. At the same time it\r\nis fair to say that our own book-illustrators and caricaturists, for\r\nsome strange reason, did a good deal to authorise the libels. Cruikshank\r\nwas no doubt a wonderful draughtsman, but I never saw (and I thank God\r\nfor it) anything like many, if not most, of his faces. \"Phiz\" and\r\nCattermole in (for example) their illustrations to _The Old Curiosity\r\nShop_ and _Barnaby Rudge_ sometimes out-Cruikshank Cruikshank in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n[47] Paul's ideas of money are still very modest. An income of 6000\r\nfrancs (£240) represents ease if not affluence; with double the amount\r\nyou can \"aspire to a duchess,\" and even the dispendious Irish-French\r\nViscount Edward de Sommerston in _La Fille aux Trois Jupons_ (_v. inf._)\r\nstarts on his career with scarcely more than three thousand a year.\r\n\r\n[48] Paul's scholarship was very rudimentary, as is shown in not a few\r\nscraps of ungrammatical Latin: he never, I think, ventures on Greek. But\r\nwhether he was the first to _estropier_ the not ugly form \"_Cleodora_,\"\r\nI know not. Perhaps he muddled it with \"Clotilde.\"\r\n\r\n[49] This cult of the widow might form the subject of a not\r\nuninteresting excursus if we were not confining ourselves to the\r\nliterary sides of our matter. It has been noticed before (Vol. I. p.\r\n368), and forms one of the most curious differences between the two\r\ncountries. For, putting Mr. Weller out of the question, I have known far\r\nfrom sentimental critics who thought Trollope's best book by no means\r\nimproved by the previous experience of Eleanor Bold. Cherolatry in\r\nFrance, however, is not really old: it hardly appears before the\r\neighteenth century. It may be partly due to a more or less conscious\r\nidea that perhaps the lady may have got over the obligatory adultery at\r\nthe expense of her \"dear first\" and may not think it necessary to\r\nrepeat. A sort of \"measles over.\"\r\n\r\n[50] He also improves his neglected education in a manner not\r\nunsuggestive of Prince Giglio. In fact, I fancy there is a good deal of\r\nhalf-latent parody of Paul in Thackeray.\r\n\r\n[51] There might have been fifteen or fifty, for the book is more a\r\nsequence of scenes than a schematic composition: for which reason the\r\nabove account of it may seem somewhat _décousu_.\r\n\r\n[52] I think I have commented elsewhere on the difficulty of villains.\r\nIt was agreeable to find confirmation, when this book was already in the\r\nprinter's hands, given at an exemption tribunal by a theatrical manager.\r\nFor six weeks, he said, he had advertised and done everything possible\r\nto supply the place of a good villain, with no success. And your bad\r\nstage villain _may_ be comic: while your bad novel villain is only a\r\nbore.\r\n\r\n[53] Frédérique, Madame Dauberny (who has, without legal sanction,\r\nrelieved herself of a loathsome creature whom she has married, and lives\r\na free though not at all immoral life), was not very easy to do, and is\r\nvery well done.\r\n\r\n[54] This, which is short and thoroughly lively, is, I imagine, the\r\nlatest of Paul's good books. It is indeed so late that instead of the\r\n_jupons_, striped and black and white, of which Georgette has made\r\nirreproachable but profitable use, she appears at the _denouement_ in a\r\ncrinoline!\r\n\r\n[55] The most interesting thing in it is a longish account by Jacques of\r\nhis association with a travelling quack and fortune-teller, which at\r\nonce reminds one of _Japhet in Search of a Father_. The resemblances and\r\nthe differences are almost equally characteristic.\r\n\r\n[56] Of course I am not comparing him with Paul on any other point.\r\n\r\n[57] Except in regard to the historical and other matters noticed above,\r\nhardly at all.\r\n\r\n[58] For a picture of an actual grisette, drawn by perhaps the greatest\r\nmaster of artistic realism (adjective and substantive so seldom found in\r\ncompany!) who ever lived, see that _Britannia_ article of Thackeray's\r\nbefore referred to--an article, for a long time, unreprinted, and\r\ntherefore, till a comparatively short time ago, practically unknown.\r\nThis and its companion articles from the _Britannia_ and the _Corsair_,\r\nall of 1840-41, but summarising ten or twelve years' knowledge of Paris,\r\nform, with the same author's _Paris Sketch Book_ (but as representing a\r\nmore mature state of his genius), the best commentary on Paul de Kock.\r\nThey may be found together in the third volume of the Oxford Thackeray\r\nedited by the present writer.\r\n\r\n[59] Unless they start from the position that an English writer on the\r\nFrench novel is bound to follow--or at least to pay express attention\r\nto--French criticism of it. This position I respectfully but unalterably\r\ndecline to accept. A critical tub that has no bottom of its own is the\r\nvery worst Danaid's vessel in all the household gear of literature.\r\n\r\n[60] The scene and society are German, but the author knows the name to\r\nhave been originally English.\r\n\r\n[61] Such, perhaps, as Gibbon himself may have used while he \"sighed as\r\na lover\" and before he \"obeyed as a son.\" It should perhaps be said that\r\nMme. de Montolieu produced many other books, mostly translations--among\r\nthe latter a French version of _The Swiss Family Robinson_.\r\n\r\n[62] In dealing with \"Sensibility\" earlier, it was pointed out how\r\nextensively things were dealt with by _letter_. In such cases as these\r\nthe fashion came in rather usefully.\r\n\r\n[63] The treatment of the authors here mentioned, _infra_, will, I hope,\r\nshow that the introduction of their names is not merely \"promiscuous.\"\r\n\r\n[64] I am quite prepared to be told that this was somebody else or\r\nnobody at all. \"Moi, je dis Madame de Genlis.\"\r\n\r\n[65] P. 436.\r\n\r\n[66] The kind endeavours of the Librarian of the London Library to\r\nobtain some in Paris itself were fruitless, but the old saying about\r\nneglecting things at your own door came true. My friend Mr. Kipling\r\nurged me to try Mr. George Gregory of Bath, and Mr. Gregory procured me\r\nalmost all the books I am noticing in this division.\r\n\r\n[67] The British Museum (see Preface) being inaccessible to me.\r\n\r\n[68] Readers will doubtless remember that the too wild career of this\r\nkind of vehicle, charioteered by wicked aristocrats, has been among the\r\nthousand-and-three causes assigned for the French Revolution.\r\n\r\n[69] Of course the author of the glossaries himself was, by actual\r\nsurname, Dufresne, Ducange being a seignory.\r\n\r\n[70] It should be observed that a very large number of these minor\r\nnovels, besides those specially mentioned as having undergone the\r\nprocess, from Ducray's downwards, were melodramatised.\r\n\r\n[71] That is to say, in the text: the second title of the whole book,\r\n\"_ou Les Enfants de Maître Jacques_,\" does in some sort give a warning,\r\nthough it is with Maître Jacques rather than with his children that the\r\nfresh start is made.\r\n\r\n[72] He has, though unknown and supposed to be an intruder, carried her\r\noff from an English adorer--a sort of Lovelace-Byron, whose name is Lord\r\nGousberycharipay (an advance on Paul de Kock and even Parny in the\r\nnomenclature of the English peerage), and who inserts h's before French\r\nwords!\r\n\r\n[73] If novels do not exaggerate the unpopularity of these persons\r\n(strictly the lay members of the S.J., but often used for the whole body\r\nof religious orders and their lay partisans), the success of \"July\"\r\nneeds little further explanation.\r\n\r\n[74] That is to say, not a bogey, but a buggy.\r\n\r\n[75] Here is another instance. Ludovica's father and a bad\r\nRusso-Prussian colonel have to be finished off at Waterloo. One might\r\nsuppose that Waterloo itself would suffice. But no: they must engage in\r\nsingle combat, and even then not kill each other, the Russian's head\r\nbeing carried off by some kind of a cannon-ball and the Frenchman's\r\nbreast pierced by half a dozen Prussian lances. This is really \"good\r\nmeasure.\"\r\n\r\n[76] Ousting others which deserved the place better? It may be so, but\r\none may perhaps \"find the whole\" without particularising everything. Of\r\nshort books especially, from Fiévée's _Dot de Suzette_ (1798), which\r\ncharmed society in its day, to Eugénie Foa's _Petit Robinson de Paris_\r\n(1840), which amused _me_ when I was about ten years old, there were no\r\nend if one talked.\r\n\r\n[77] _V. inf._ on M. Ohnet's books.\r\n\r\n[78] Many people have probably noticed the frequency of this name--not a\r\nvery pretty one in itself, and with no particular historical or other\r\nattraction--in France and French of the earlier nineteenth century. It\r\nwas certainly due to _Le Solitaire_.\r\n\r\n[79] If any proper moral reader is disturbed at this conjunction of\r\n_amante_ and _mère_, he will be glad to know that M. d'Arlincourt\r\nelsewhere regularises the situation and calls Night \"_l'épouse_\r\nd'Érèbe.\"\r\n\r\n[80] In the Radcliffian-literary not the Robespierrean-political sense.\r\nFor the Wertherism, _v. sup._ on Chateaubriand, p. 24 note.\r\n\r\n[81] He was four years older than Nodier, but did not begin to write\r\nfiction nearly so early. The _Phantasiestücke_ are of 1814, while Nodier\r\nhad been writing stories, under German influence, as early as 1803. It\r\nis, however, also fair to say that all those now to be noticed are later\r\nthan 1814, and even than Hoffmann's later collections, the _Elixiere des\r\nTeufels_ and _Nachtstücke_.\r\n\r\n[82] The prudent as well as judicious poet who wrote these lines\r\nprovided a variant to suit those who, basing their position on\r\n\"Ramillies _cock_,\" maintain that it was a hat, not a wig, that was\r\nnamed after Villeroy's defeat. For \"grave--big\" read \"where Gallic hopes\r\nfell flat,\" and for \"wig\" \"hat\" _simpliciter_, and the thing is done.\r\nBut Thackeray has \"Ramillies _wig_\" and Scott implies it.\r\n\r\n[83] Nodier, who had been in Scotland and, as has been said, was a\r\nphilologist of the better class, is scrupulously exact in spelling\r\nproper names as a rule. Perhaps Loch Fyne is not exactly \"Le Lac Beau\"\r\n(I have not the Gaelic). But from Pentland to Solway (literally) he\r\nmakes no blunder, and he actually knows all about \"Argyle's Bowling\r\nGreen.\"\r\n\r\n[84] If phonetics had never done anything worse than this they would not\r\nbe as loathsome to literature as they sometimes are.\r\n\r\n[85] On the other hand, compared with its slightly elder contemporary,\r\n_Le Solitaire_ (_v. sup._), it is a masterpiece.\r\n\r\n[86] Two little passages towards the end are very precious. A certain\r\nbridegroom (I abridge a little) is \"perfectly healthy, perfectly\r\nself-possessed, a great talker, a successful man of business, with some\r\nknowledge of physics, chemistry, jurisprudence, politics, statistics,\r\nand phrenology; enjoying all the requirements of a deputy; and for the\r\nrest, a liberal, an anti-romantic, a philanthropist, a very good\r\nfellow--and absolutely intolerable.\" This person later changes the\r\nhumble home of tragedy into a \"school of mutual instruction, where the\r\nchildren learn to hate and envy each other and to read and write, which\r\nwas all they needed to become detestable creatures.\" These words \"please\r\nthe soul well.\"\r\n\r\n[87] The description is worth comparing with that of Gautier's _Château\r\nde la Misère_--the difference between all but complete ruin and mere,\r\nthough extreme, disrepair being admirably, and by the later master in\r\nall probability designedly, worked out.\r\n\r\n[88] _Et fugit ad salices et se cupit ante videri._\r\n\r\n[89] Note, too, a hint at a never filled in romance of the captain's\r\nown.\r\n\r\n[90] I must ask for special emphasis on \"beauty.\" Nothing can be _finer_\r\nor _fitter_ than the style of Steenie's ghostly experiences. And the\r\nfamous Claverhouse passage _is_ beautiful.\r\n\r\n[91] As Rossetti saw it in \"Sibylla Palmifera\":\r\n\r\n     \"Under the arch of Life, where Love and Death,\r\n     _Terror_ and Mystery guard her shrine,\r\n     I saw Beauty enthroned.\"\r\n\r\n[92] Perhaps there are few writers mentioned in this book to whose\r\nlovers exactly the same kind of apology is desirable as it is in the\r\ncase of Nodier. \"Where,\" I hear reproaching voices crying, \"is _Jean\r\nSbogar_? Where is _Laure Ruthwen ou les Vampires_ in novel-plural or _Le\r\nVampire_ in melodrama-singular? Where are a score or a hundred other\r\nbooks, pieces, pages, paragraphs, passages from five to fifty words\r\nlong?\" They are not here, and I could not find room for them here. \"But\r\nyou found more room for Paul de Kock?\" Yes: and I have tried to show\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nVICTOR HUGO\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Limitations.]\r\n\r\nAt the present day, and perhaps in all days hitherto, the greatest\r\nwriter of the nineteenth century in France for length of practice,\r\ndiversity of administration of genius, height of intention, and (for a\r\nlong time at least) magnitude and altitude of fame, enjoys, and has\r\nenjoyed, more popular repute in England for his work in prose fiction\r\nthan for any other part of it. With the comparative side of this\r\nestimate the present writer can indeed nowise agree; and the reasons of\r\nhis disagreement should be made good in the present chapter. But this is\r\nthe first opportunity he has had of considering, with fair room and\r\nverge, the justice of the latter part of Tennyson's compliment \"Victor\r\n_in Romance_\"; and it will pretty certainly be the last. As for a\r\ngeneral judgment of the positive and relative value and qualities of the\r\nwonderful procession of work--certainly deserving that adjective\r\nwhatever other or others may be added--which covers the space of a full\r\nhalf-century from _Han d'Islande_ to _Quatre-Vingt-Treize_, it would,\r\naccording to the notions of criticism here followed, be improper to\r\nattempt that till after the procession itself has been carefully\r\nsurveyed.\r\n\r\nNor will it be necessary to preface, to follow, or, except very rarely\r\nand slightly, to accompany this survey with remarks on the non-literary\r\ncharacteristics of this French Titan of literature. The object often of\r\nfrantic political and bitter personal abuse; for a long time of almost\r\nequally frantic and much sillier political and personal idolatry;\r\nhimself the victim--in consequence partly of his own faults, partly of\r\nignoble jealousy of greatness, but perhaps most of all of the inevitable\r\nreaction from this foolish cult--of the most unsparing rummage into\r\nthose faults, and the weaknesses which accompany them, that any poet or\r\nprose writer, even Pope, has experienced--Victor Hugo still, though he\r\nhas had many a _vates_ in both senses of _sacer_, may almost be allowed\r\n_carere_ critico _sacro_,[93] in the best sense, on the whole of his\r\nlife and work. I have no pretensions to fill or bridge the whole of the\r\ngap here. It will be quite task enough for the present, leaving the life\r\nalmost alone, to attempt the part of the work which contains prose\r\nfiction. Nothing said of this will in the least affect what I have often\r\nsaid elsewhere, and shall hold to as long as I hold anything, in regard\r\nto the poetry--that its author is the greatest poet of France, and one\r\nof the great poets of the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Han d'Islande._]\r\n\r\nTo deal with Hugo's first published, though not first written, novel\r\nrequires, in almost the highest degree, what Mr. Matthew Arnold called\r\n\"a purged considerate mind.\" There are, I believe, some people (I myself\r\nknow at least one of great excellence) who, having had the good luck to\r\nread _Han d'Islande_ as schoolboys, and finding its vein congenial to\r\ntheirs, have, as in such cases is not impossible, kept it unscathed in\r\ntheir liking. But this does not happen to every one. I do not think,\r\nthough I am not quite certain, that when I first read it myself I was\r\nexactly what may be called a schoolboy pure and simple (that is to say,\r\nunder fifteen). But if I did not read it in upper school-boyhood (that\r\nis to say, before eighteen), I certainly did, not much later. I own that\r\nat that time, whatever my exact age was, I found it so uninteresting\r\nthat I do not believe I read it through. Nor, except in the last\r\nrespect, have I improved with it--for it would be presumptuous to say,\r\n\"has it improved with me\"--since. The author apologised for it in two\r\nsuccessive prefaces shortly after its appearance, and in yet another\r\nafter that of _Notre-Dame de Paris_, ten years later. None of them, it\r\nis to be feared, \"touches the spot.\" The first, indeed, is hardly an\r\napology at all, but a sort of _goguenard_ \"showing off\" of the kind not\r\nuncommon with youth; the second, a little more serious, contains rather\r\ninteresting hits[94] of again youthful jealousy at the popularity of\r\nPigault-Lebrun and Ducray-Duminil; the third and much later one is a\r\nvery early instance of the Victorian philosophising. \"There must be,\" we\r\nare told with the solemnity which for some sixty years excited such a\r\ncurious mixture of amazement and amusement, \"in every work of the\r\nmind--drama or novel--there must be many things felt, many things\r\nobserved, and many things divined,\" and while in _Han_ there is only one\r\nthing felt--a young man's love--and one observed--a girl's ditto--the\r\nrest is all divined, is \"the fantastic imagination of an adolescent.\"\r\n\r\nOne impeticoses the gratility of the explanation, and refrains, as far\r\nas may be, from saying, \"Words! words!\" Unluckily, the book does very\r\nlittle indeed to supply deeds to match. The feeling and the observation\r\nfurnish forth a most unstimulating love-story; at least the present\r\ncritic, who has an unabashed fondness for love-stories, has never been\r\nable to feel the slightest interest either in Ordener Guldenlew or in\r\nEthel Schumacker, except in so far as the lady is probably the first of\r\nthe since innumerable and sometimes agreeable heroines of her name in\r\nfiction. As for the \"divining,\" the \"intention,\" and the \"imagination,\"\r\nthey have been exerted to sadly little purpose. The absurd nomenclature,\r\ndefinitely excused in one of the prefaces, may have a slight historic\r\ninterest as the first attempt, almost a hopeless failure, at that\r\n_science des noms_ with which Hugo was later credited, and which he\r\ncertainly sometimes displayed. It is hardly necessary to say much about\r\nSpladgest and Oglypiglaf, Musdaemon and Orugix. They are pure\r\nschoolboyisms. But it is perhaps fair to relieve the author from the\r\nreproach, which has been thrown on him by some of his English\r\ntranslators, of having metamorphosed \"Hans\" into \"Han.\" He himself\r\nexplains distinctly that the name was a nickname, taken from the grunt\r\nor growl (the word is in France applied to the well-known noise made by\r\na paviour lifting and bringing down his rammer) of the monster.\r\n\r\nBut that monster himself! A more impossible improbability and a more\r\nimprobable impossibility never conceived itself in the brain of even an\r\nas yet failure of an artist. Han appears to have done all sorts of nasty\r\nthings, such as eating the insides of babies when they were alive and\r\ndrinking the blood of enemies when they were not dead, out of the skulls\r\nof his own offspring, which he had extracted from _their_ dead bodies by\r\na process like peeling a banana: also to have achieved some terrible\r\nones, such as burning cathedrals and barracks, upsetting rocks on whole\r\nbattalions, and so forth. But the only chances we have of seeing him at\r\nreal business show him to us as overcoming, with some trouble, an infirm\r\nold man, and _not_ overcoming at all, after a struggle of long duration,\r\na not portentously powerful young one. His white bear, and not he, seems\r\nto have had the chief merit of despatching six surely rather incompetent\r\nhunters who followed the rash \"Kennybol\": and of his two final\r\nachievements, that of poniarding two men in a court of justice might\r\nhave been brought about by anybody who was careless enough of his own\r\nlife, and that of setting his gaol on fire by any one who, with the same\r\ncarelessness, had a corrupt gaoler to supply him with the means.\r\n\r\nIt would be equally tedious and superfluous to go through the minor\r\ncharacters and incidents. The virtuous and imprisoned statesman\r\nSchumacker, Ethel's father, excites no sympathy: his malignant and\r\nfinally defeated enemy, the Chancellor Ahlefeld, no interest. That\r\nenemy's most _un_virtuous wife and her paramour Musdaemon--_the_\r\nvillain of the piece as Han is the monster--as to whom one wonders\r\nwhether he could ever have been as attractive as a lover as he is\r\nunattractive as a villain, are both puppets. Indeed, one would hardly\r\npay any attention to the book at all if it did not hold a position in\r\nthe work of a man of the highest genius partly similar to, and partly\r\ncontrasted with, that of _Zastrozzi_ and _St. Irvyne_. But _St. Irvyne_\r\nand _Zastrozzi_ are much shorter than _Han d'Islande_, and Shelley,\r\nwhether by accident, wisdom (_nemo omnibus horis insanit_), or the\r\ndirect intervention of Apollo, never resumed the task for which his\r\ngenius was so obviously unsuited.\r\n\r\nStill, it must be said for Hugo that, even at this time, he could\r\nhave--in a manner actually had--put in evidence of not absolute\r\nincompetence for the task.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Bug-Jargal._]\r\n\r\n_Bug-Jargal_ was, as glanced at above, written, according to its\r\nauthor's own statement, two years before _Han_, when he was only\r\nsixteen; was partially printed (in the _Constitutionnel_) and (in fear\r\nof a piracy) rewritten in fifteen days and published, seven years after\r\nits composition, and almost as many before _Notre-Dame de Paris_\r\nappeared. Taking it as it stands, there is nothing of the sixteen years\r\nor of the fifteen days to be seen in it. It is altogether superior to\r\n_Han_, and though it has not the nightmare magnificence and the\r\nphantasmagoric variety of _Notre-Dame_, it is, not merely because it is\r\nmuch shorter, a far better told, more coherent, and more generally human\r\nstory. The jester-obi Habibrah has indeed the caricature-grotesquery of\r\nHan himself, and of Quasimodo, and long afterwards of Gwynplaine, as\r\nwell as the devilry of the first named and of Thénardier in _Les\r\nMisérables_; but we do not see too much of him, and nothing that he does\r\nis exactly absurd or utterly improbable. The heroine--so far as there is\r\na heroine in Marie d'Auverney, wife of the part-hero-narrator, but\r\nseparated from him on the very day of their marriage by the rebellion of\r\nSan Domingo--is very slight; but then, according to the story, she is\r\nnot wanted to be anything more. The cruelty, treachery, etc., of the\r\nhalf-caste Biassou are not overdone, nor is the tropical scenery, nor\r\nindeed anything else. Even the character of Bug-Jargal himself, a\r\nmodernised Oroonoko (whom probably Hugo did not know) and a more direct\r\ndescendant of persons and things in Rousseau, Bernardin de Saint-Pierre,\r\nand to some extent the \"sensibility\" novelists generally (whom he\r\ncertainly did know), is kept within bounds. And, what is perhaps most\r\nextraordinary of all, the half-comic interludes in the narrative where\r\nAuverney's comrades talk while he makes breaks in his story, contain few\r\nof Hugo's usually disastrous attempts at humour. It is impossible to say\r\nthat the book is of any great importance or of any enthralling interest.\r\nBut it is the most workmanlike of all Hugo's work in prose fiction, and,\r\nexcept _Les Travailleurs de La Mer_ and _Quatre-Vingt-Treize_, which\r\nhave greater faults as well as greater beauties, the most readable, if\r\nnot, like them, the most likely to be re-read.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Dernier Jour d'un Condamné._]\r\n\r\nIts merits are certainly not ill set off by the two shorter pieces, both\r\nof fairly early date, but the one a little before and the other a little\r\nafter _Notre-Dame de Paris_, which usually accompany it in the collected\r\neditions. Of these _Le Dernier Jour d'un Condamné_ is, with its tedious\r\npreface, almost two-thirds as long as _Bug-Jargal_ itself; the other,\r\n_Claude Gueux_, contents itself with thirty pages. Both are pieces with\r\na purpose--manifestos of one of Hugo's most consistent and most\r\nirrational crazes--the objection to capital punishment.[95] There is no\r\nneed to argue against this, the immortal \"Que MM. les assassins,\" etc.,\r\nbeing, though in fact the weakest of a thousand refutations, sufficient,\r\nonce for all, to explode it. But it is not irrelevant to point out that\r\nthe two pieces themselves are very battering-rams against their own\r\ntheory. We are not told--the objection to this omission was made at the\r\ntime, of course, and Hugo's would-be lofty waving-off of this is one of\r\nthe earliest of many such--what the condemned person's crime was. But\r\nthe upshot of his lucubrations during these latest hours of his is this,\r\nthat such hours are almost more uncomfortable than the minutes of the\r\nactual execution can possibly be. As this is exactly one of the points\r\non which the advocates of the punishment, whether from the point of view\r\nof deterrence or from that of retribution, chiefly rely, it seems\r\nsomething of a blunder to bring it out with all the power of a poet and\r\na rhetorician. We _want_ \"M. l'Assassin,\" in fact, to be made very\r\nuncomfortable--as uncomfortable as possible--and we want M. l'Assassin,\r\nin intention or deliberation, to be warned that he will be so made.\r\n\"Serve him right\" sums up the one view, \"De te fabula\" the other. In\r\nfact cheap copies of _Le Dernier Jour_, supplied to all about to commit\r\nmurder, would be highly valuable. Putting aside its purpose, the mere\r\nliterary power is of course considerable if not consummate; it hardly\r\npretends to be a \"furnished\" _story_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Claude Gueux._]\r\n\r\nThe piece, however, is tragic enough: it could hardly fail to be so in\r\nthe hands of such a master of tragedy, just as it could hardly fail to\r\nbe illogical in the hands of such a paralogician. But _Claude Gueux_,\r\nthough it ends with a murder and an attempt at suicide and an execution,\r\nis really, though far from intentionally, a farce. The hero, made (by\r\nthe \"fault of society,\" of course) a criminal, though not a serious one,\r\nthinks himself persecuted by the prison director, and murders that\r\nofficial. The reader who does not know the book will suppose that he has\r\nbeen treated as Charles Reade's wicked governor treated Josephs and\r\nRobinson and the other victims in _It is Never too Late to Mend_. Not at\r\nall. The redoubtable Claude had, like the great Victor himself and other\r\nquite respectable men, an equally redoubtable appetite, and the prison\r\nrations were not sufficient for him. As he was a sort of leader or\r\nprison shop-steward, and his fellow-convicts looked up to him, a young\r\nfellow who was not a great eater used to give Claude part of his\r\nallowance. The director, discovering this, removed the young man into\r\nanother ward--an action possibly rather spiteful, possibly also only a\r\nslight excess, or no excess at all, of red-tapeism in discipline. Claude\r\nnot merely asks reasons for this,--which, of course, even if\r\nrespectfully done, was an act of clear insubordination on any but\r\nanarchist principles,--but repeats the enquiry. The director more than\r\nonce puts the question by, but inflicts no penalty. Whereupon Claude\r\nmakes a harangue to the shop (which appears, in some astounding fashion,\r\nto have been left without any supervision between the director's\r\nvisits), repeats once more, on the director's entrance, his\r\ninsubordinate enquiry, again has it put by, and thereupon splits the\r\nunfortunate official's skull with a hatchet, digging also a pair of\r\nscissors, which once belonged to his (left-handed) wife, into his own\r\nthroat. And the wretches actually cure this hardly fallen angel, and\r\nthen guillotine him, which he takes most sweetly, placing at the last\r\nmoment in the hand of the attendant priest, with the words _Pour les\r\npauvres_, a five-franc piece, which one of the Sisters of the prison\r\nhospital had given him! After this Hugo, not contented with the tragedy\r\nof the edacious murderer, gives us seven pages of his favourite rhetoric\r\nin _saccadé_ paragraphs on the general question.\r\n\r\nAs so often with him, one hardly knows which particular question to ask\r\nfirst, \"Did ever such a genius make such a fool of himself?\" or \"Was\r\never such an artist given to such hopeless slips in the most rudimentary\r\nprocesses of art?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Notre-Dame de Paris._]\r\n\r\nBut it is, of course, not till we come to _Notre-Dame de Paris_ that any\r\nserious discussion of Hugo's claims as a novelist is possible. Hitherto,\r\nwhile in novel at least he has very doubtfully been an _enfant sublime_,\r\nhe has most unquestionably been an _enfant_. Whatever faults may be\r\nchargeable on his third novel or romance proper, they include no more\r\nchildishness than he displayed throughout his life, and not nearly so\r\nmuch as he often did later.\r\n\r\nThe book, moreover, to adopt and adapt the language of another matter,\r\nwhether disputably or indisputably great in itself, is unquestionably so\r\n\"by position.\" It is one of the chief manifestos--there are some who\r\nhave held, and perhaps would still hold, that it is _the_ chief\r\nmanifesto and example--of one of the most remarkable and momentous of\r\nliterary movements--the great French Romantic revolt of\r\n_mil-huit-cent-trente_. It had for a time enormous popularity, extending\r\nto many who had not the slightest interest in it as such a manifesto; it\r\naffected not merely its own literature, but others, and other arts\r\nbesides literature, both in its own and other countries. To whatever\r\nextent this popularity may have been affected--first by the transference\r\nof interest from the author's \"letters\" to his politics and sociology,\r\nand secondly, by the reaction in general esteem which followed his\r\ndeath--it is not very necessary to enquire. One certainly sees fewer,\r\nindeed, positively few, references to it and to its contents now. But it\r\nwas so bright a planet when it first came into ken; it exercised its\r\ninfluence so long and so largely; that even if it now glows fainter it\r\nis worth exploring, and the analysis of the composition of its light is\r\nworth putting on record.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The story easy to anticipate.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of a book which, whether it has or has not undergone some\r\noccultation as suggested, is still kept on sale not merely in the\r\noriginal, but in cheap translations into every European tongue, there is\r\nprobably no need to include an actual \"argument\" in this analysis. As a\r\nnovel or at least romance, _Notre-Dame de Paris_ contains a story of the\r\nlate fifteenth century, the chief characters of which are the Spanish\r\ngipsy[96] dancing-girl Esmeralda, with her goat Djali; Quasimodo, the\r\nhunchbacked dwarf and bell-ringer of the cathedral; one of its\r\narchdeacons, Claude Frollo, theologian, philosopher, expert in, but\r\ncontemner of, physical and astrological science, and above all,\r\nalchemist, if not sorcerer; the handsome and gallant, but \"not\r\nintelligent\" and not very chivalrous soldier Phoebus de Chateaupers,\r\nwith minors not a few, \"supers\" very many, and the dramatist Pierre\r\nGringoire as a sort of half-chorus, half-actor throughout. The evolution\r\nof this story could not be very difficult to anticipate in any case;\r\nalmost any one who had even a slight knowledge of its actual author's\r\nother work could make a guess at the _scenario_. The end must be tragic;\r\nthe _beau cavalier_ must be the rather unworthy object of Esmeralda's\r\naffection, and she herself that of the (one need hardly say very\r\ndifferent) affections of Frollo and Quasimodo; a charge of sorcery,\r\nbased on the tricks she has taught Djali, must be fatal to her; and\r\npoetic justice must overtake Frollo, who has instigated the persecution\r\nbut has half exchanged it for, half-combined it with, later attempts of\r\na different kind upon her. Although this _scenario_ may not have been\r\nthen quite so easy for any schoolboy to anticipate, as it has been\r\nlater, the course of the romantic novel from Walpole to Scott in\r\nEnglish, not to mention German and other things, had made it open enough\r\nto everybody to construct. The only thing to be done, and to do, now\r\nwas, and is, to see, on the author's own famous critical principles,[97]\r\nhow he availed himself of the _publica materies_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of the actual _title_.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first impression of any reader who is not merely not an\r\nexpert in criticism, but who has not yet learnt its first, last, and\r\nhardest lesson, shirked by not a few who seem to be experts--to suspend\r\njudgment till the case is fully heard--may be unfavourable. It is true\r\nthat the title _Notre-Dame de Paris_, so stupidly and unfairly disguised\r\nby the addition-substitution of \"_The Hunchback_ of Notre Dame\" in\r\nEnglish translations--quite honestly and quite legitimately warns any\r\nintelligent reader what to expect. It is the cathedral itself, its\r\nvisible appearance and its invisible _aura_, atmosphere, history,\r\nspirit, inspiration which gives the author--and is taken by him as\r\ngiving--his real subject. Esmeralda and Quasimodo, Frollo and Gringoire\r\nare almost as much minors and supers in comparison with It or Her as\r\nPhoebus de Chateaupers and the younger Frollo and the rest are in\r\nrelation to the four protagonists themselves. The most ambitious piece\r\nof _dianoia_--of thought as contrasted with incident, character, or\r\ndescription--is that embodied in the famous chapter, _Ceci tuera cela_,\r\nwhere the fatal effect of literature (at least printed literature) on\r\narchitecture is inculcated. The situation, precincts, construction,\r\nconstitution of the church form the centre of such action as there is,\r\nand supply by far the larger part of its scene. Therefore nobody has a\r\nright to complain of a very large proportion of purely architectural\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The working out of the one under the other.]\r\n\r\nBut the question is whether, in the actual employment, and still more in\r\nwhat we may call the administration, of this and other diluents or\r\nobstruents of story, the artist has or has not made blunders in his art;\r\nand it is very difficult not to answer this in the affirmative. There\r\nwere many excuses for him. The \"guide-book novel\" had already, and not\r\nso very long before, been triumphantly introduced by _Corinne_. It had\r\nbeen enormously popularised by Scott. The close alliance and almost\r\nassimilation of art and history with literature was one of the supremest\r\narticles of faith of Romanticism, and \"the Gothic\" was a sort of symbol,\r\nshibboleth, and sacrament at once of Romanticism itself. But Victor\r\nHugo, like Falstaff, has, in this and other respects, abused his power\r\nof pressing subjects into service almost, if not quite, damnably.\r\nWhether out of pure wilfulness, out of mistaken theory, or out of a\r\nmixture[98] of these and other influences, he has made the first volume\r\nalmost as little of a story as it could possibly be, while remaining a\r\nstory at all. Seventy mortal pages, pretty well packed in the standard\r\ntwo-volume edition, which in all contains less than six hundred, dawdle\r\nover the not particularly well-told business of Gringoire's interrupted\r\nmystery, the arrival of the Flemish ambassadors, and the election of the\r\nPope of Unreason. The vision of Esmeralda lightens the darkness and\r\nquickens the movement, and this brightness and liveliness continue till\r\nshe saves her unlucky dramatist from the murderous diversions of the\r\nCour des Miracles. But the means by which she does this--the old\r\nprivilege of matrimony--leads to nothing but a single scene, which might\r\nhave been effective, but which Hugo only leaves flat, while it has no\r\nfurther importance in the story whatsoever. After it we hop or struggle\r\nfull forty pages through the public street of architecture pure and\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The story recovers itself latterly.]\r\n\r\nAt first sight \"Coup d'oeil impartial sur l'Ancienne Magistrature\" may\r\nseem to give even more promise of November than of May. But there _is_\r\naction here, and it really has something to do with the story. Also, the\r\nsubsequent treatment of the recluse or anchoress of the severest type in\r\nthe Place Notre-Dame itself (or practically so), though it is much too\r\nlong and is lengthened by matters with which Hugo knows least of all how\r\nto deal, has still more claim to attention, for it leads directly on not\r\nmerely to the parentage of Esmeralda, but to the tragedy of her fate.\r\nAnd almost the whole of the second volume is, whether the best\r\nnovel-matter or not, at any rate genuine novel-matter. If almost the\r\nwhole of the first had been boiled down (as Scott at his best would have\r\nboiled it) into a preliminary chapter or two, the position of the book\r\nas qualified to stand in its kind could not have been questioned. But\r\nits faults and merits in that kind would still have remained matters of\r\nvery considerable question.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: But the characters?]\r\n\r\nIn respect of one fault, the side of the defence can surely be taken\r\nonly by generous, but hardly judicious or judicial devotees. Hugo's\r\nsingular affection for the monster--he had Stephano to justify him, but\r\nunfortunately did not possess either the humour of that drunken\r\nNeapolitan butler or the power of his and Caliban's creator--had made a\r\nmere grotesque of _Han_, but had been reduced within more artistic\r\nlimits in _Bug_. In _Le Dernier Jour_ and _Claude Gueux_ it was excluded\r\nby the subjects and objects alike.[99] Here it is, if not an\r\n_intellectus_, at any rate _sibi permissus_; and, as it does not in the\r\nearlier cases, it takes the not extremely artistic form of violent\r\ncontrast which was to be made more violent later in _L'Homme Qui Rit_.\r\nIf any one will consider Caliban and Miranda as they are presented in\r\n_The Tempest_, with Quasimodo and Esmeralda as _they_ are presented\r\nhere, he will see at once the difference of great art and great failure\r\nof art.\r\n\r\nThen, too, there emerges another of our author's persistent obsessions,\r\nthe exaggeration of what we may call the individual combat. He had\r\nprobably intended something of this kind in _Han_, but the mistake there\r\nin telling about it instead of telling it has been already pointed out.\r\nNeither Bug-Jargal nor Habibrah does anything glaringly and longwindedly\r\nimpossible. But the one-man defence of Notre-Dame by Quasimodo against\r\nthe _truands_ is a tissue not so much of impossibilities--they, as it\r\nhas been said of old, hardly matter--as of the foolish-incredible. Why\r\ndid the numerous other denizens of the church and its cloisters do\r\nnothing during all this time? Why did the _truands_, who, though they\r\nwere all scoundrels, were certainly not all fools, confine themselves to\r\nthis frontal assault of so huge a building? Why did the little rascal\r\nJean Frollo not take some one with him? These are not questions of mere\r\ndull common sense; it is only dull absence of common sense which will\r\nthink them so. Scott, who, once more, was not too careful in stopping\r\nloose places, managed the attacks of Tillietudlem and Torquilstone\r\nwithout giving any scope for objections of this kind.\r\n\r\nHugo's strong point was never character, and it certainly is not so\r\nhere. Esmeralda is beautiful, amiable, pathetic, and unfortunate; but\r\nthe most uncharitable interpretation of Mr. Pope's famous libel never\r\nwas more justified than in her case. Her salvage of Gringoire and its\r\nsequel give about the only situations in which she is a real\r\nperson,[100] and they are purely episodic. Gringoire himself is as much\r\nout of place as any literary man who ever went into Parliament. Some may\r\nthink better of Claude Frollo, who may be said to be the\r\nMiltonic-Byronic-Satanic hero. I own I do not. His mere\r\nspecification--that of the ascetic scholar assailed by physical\r\ntemptation--will pass muster well enough, the working out of it hardly.\r\n\r\nHis brother, the _vaurien_ Jean, has, I believe, been a favourite with\r\nothers or the same, and certainly a Villonesque student is not out of\r\nplace in the fifteenth century. Nor is a turned-up nose, even if it be\r\nartificially and prematurely reddened, unpardonable. But at the same\r\ntime it is not in itself a passport, and Jean Frollo does not appear to\r\nhave left even the smallest _Testament_ or so much as a single line\r\n(though some snatches of song are assigned to him) reminding us of the\r\n\"Dames des Temps Jadis\" or the \"Belle Heaulmière.\" Perhaps even Victor\r\nnever presumed more unfortunately on victory than in bringing in Louis\r\nXI., especially in one scene, which directly challenges comparison with\r\n_Quentin Durward_. While, though Scott's _jeunes premiers_ are not, as\r\nhe himself well knew and frankly confessed, his greatest triumphs, he\r\nhas never given us anything of the kind so personally impersonal as\r\nPhoebus de Chateaupers.\r\n\r\n_Per contra_ there are of course to be set passages which are actually\r\nfine prose and some of which might have made magnificent poetry; a real\r\nor at least--what is as good as or better than a real--a fantastic\r\nresurrection of Old Paris; and, above all, an atmosphere of \"sunset and\r\neclipse,\" of night and thunder and levin-flashes, which no one of\r\ncatholic taste would willingly surrender. Only, ungrateful as it may\r\nseem, uncritical as some may deem it, it is impossible not to sigh,\r\n\"Oh! why were not the best things of this treated in verse, and why were\r\nnot the other things left alone altogether?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The thirty years' interval.]\r\n\r\nFor a very long stretch of time--one that could hardly be paralleled\r\nexcept in a literary life so unusually extended as his--it might have\r\nseemed that one of those _voix intérieures_, which he was during its\r\ncourse to celebrate in undying verse, had whispered to Hugo some such\r\nwarning as that conveyed in the words of the close of the last\r\nparagraph, and that he, usually the most indocile of men, had listened\r\nto it. For all but three decades he confined his production--at least in\r\nthe sense of substantial publication[101]--to poetry almost invariably\r\nsplendid, drama always grandiose and sometimes grand, and prose-writing\r\nof a chiefly political kind, which even sympathisers (one would suppose)\r\ncan hardly regard as of much value now if they have any critical\r\nfaculty. Even the tremendous shock of disappointment, discomfiture, and\r\nexile which resulted from the success of Napoleon the Third, though it\r\nstarted a new wave and gust of oceanic and cyclonic force, range, and\r\nvolume in his soul, found little prose vent, except the wretched stuff\r\nof _Napoléon le Petit_, to chequer the fulgurant outburst of the\r\n_Châtiments_, the apocalyptic magnificence of the _Contemplations_, and\r\nthe almost unmatched vigour, variety, and vividness of the _Légende des\r\nSiècles_.\r\n\r\nAt last, in 1862, a full decade after the cataclysm, his largest and\r\nprobably his most popular work of fiction made its appearance in the\r\nreturn to romance-writing, entitled _Les Misérables_. I daresay\r\nbiographies say when it was begun; it is at any rate clear that even\r\nVictor Hugo must have taken some years, especially in view of his other\r\nwork, to produce such a mass of matter.[102] Probably not very many\r\npeople now living, at least in England, remember very clearly the\r\nimmense effect it produced even with us, who were then apt to regard\r\nHugo as at best a very chequered genius and at worst an almost\r\ncharlatanish rhetorician.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Les Misérables._]\r\n\r\nIt was no doubt lucky for its popularity that it fell in with a general\r\nmovement, in England as well as elsewhere, which had with us been, if\r\nnot brought about, aided by influences in literature as different as\r\nthose of Dickens and Carlyle, through Kingsley and others\r\ndownwards,--the movement which has been called perhaps more truly than\r\nsympathetically, \"the cult of the lower [not to say the criminal]\r\nclasses.\" In France, if not in England, this cult had been oddly\r\ncombined with a dash of rather adulterated Romanticism, and long before\r\nHugo, Sues and Sands, as will be seen later, had in their different\r\nmanner been priests and priestesses of it. In his own case the adoption\r\nof the subject \"keyed on\" in no small degree to the mood in which he\r\nwrote the _Dernier Jour_ and _Claude Gueux_, while a good deal of the\r\n\"Old Paris\" mania (I use the word nowise contumeliously) of _Notre-Dame_\r\nsurvived, and even the \"Cour des Miracles\" found itself modernised.\r\n\r\nWhether the popularity above mentioned has kept itself up or not, I\r\ncannot say. Of one comparatively recent edition, not so far as I know\r\npublished at intervals, I have been told that the first volume is out of\r\nprint, but none of the others, a thing rather voiceful to the\r\nunderstanding. I know that, to me, it is the hardest book to read\r\nthrough of any that I know by a great writer. _Le Grand Cyrus_ and\r\n_Clélie_ are certainly longer, _Clarissa_ and _Sir Charles Grandison_\r\nare probably so. _Le Vicomte de Bragelonne_ is almost as long. There are\r\nfiner things in it than in any of them, (except the deaths of Lovelace\r\nand Porthos and the kidnapping of General Monk) from the pure novel\r\npoint of view, and not a few passages which ought to have been verse\r\nand, even prose as they are, soar far over anything that Mademoiselle de\r\nScudéry or Samuel Richardson or Alexandre Dumas could possibly have\r\nwritten in either harmony. The Scudéry books are infinitely duller, and\r\nthe Richardson ones much less varied.\r\n\r\nBut none of these others besets the path of the reader with things to\r\nwhich the obstacles interposed by Quilp in the way of Sampson Brass were\r\ndown-pillows, as is the case with _Les Misérables_. It is as if Victor\r\nHugo had said, \"You shall read this at your peril,\" and had made good\r\nthe threat by dint of every blunder in novel-writing which he could\r\npossibly commit. With his old and almost invariable fault (there is a\r\nlittle of it even in _Les Travailleurs de la Mer_, and only\r\n_Quatre-Vingt-Treize_ avoids it entirely), he delays any real interest\r\ntill the book, huge as it is, is almost half way through. Twenty pages\r\non Bishop Myriel--that rather piebald angel who makes the way impossible\r\nfor any successor by his fantastic and indecent \"apostolicism\" in\r\nliving; who tells, _not_ like St. Athanasius, an allowable equivocation\r\nto save his valuable self, but a downright lie to save a worthless\r\nrascal; and who admits defeat in argument by the stale sophisms of a\r\nmoribund _conventionnel_--might have been tolerable. We have, in the\r\ncompactest edition I know, about a hundred and fifty. The ruin and\r\ndesertion of Fantine would have been worth twenty more. We have from\r\nfifty to a hundred to tell us the story of four rather impossibly\r\nbeautiful _grisettes_, and as many, alas! too possible, but not\r\ninteresting, rascals of students. It is difficult to say how much is\r\nwasted on the wildly improbable transformation of Jean Valjean, convict\r\nand pauper, into \"M. Madeleine,\" _maire_ and (_nummis gallicis_)\r\nmillionaire, through making sham jet. All this, by any one who really\r\nknew his craft, would have been sketched rapidly in fluent preliminary,\r\nand subsequent piecemeal retrospect, so as to start with Valjean's\r\nescape from Thénardier and his adoption of Cosette.\r\n\r\nThe actual matter of this purely preliminary kind extends, as has been\r\nascertained by rough but sufficient calculation of the sort previously\r\nemployed, to at least three-quarters of an average novel of Sir\r\nWalter's: it would probably run to two or three times the length of a\r\nmodern \"six-shilling.\" But Hugo is not satisfied with it. A point, an\r\nimportant point, doubtless, but one that could have been despatched in a\r\nfew lines, connects the novel proper with the Battle of Waterloo. To\r\nthat battle itself, even the preliminary matter in its earliest part is\r\nsome years posterior: the main action, of course, is still more so. But\r\nVictor must give us _his_ account of this great engagement, and he gives\r\nit in about a hundred pages of the most succinct reproduction. For my\r\npart, I should be glad to have it \"mixed with much wine,\" even if the\r\nwine were of that luscious and headachy south-of-France character which\r\nhe himself is said to have preferred to Bordeaux or Champagne, Sauterne\r\nor even Burgundy. Nay, without this I like it well enough and quarrel\r\nwith nothing in it, though it is in many respects (from the famous\r\nhollow way which nobody else ever heard of downwards) very much of a\r\ndream-battle. Victor does quite as much justice as any one could expect\r\nhim to do--and, thank heaven, there are still some Englishmen who are\r\nperfectly indifferent whether justice is done to them or not in these\r\nmatters, leaving it to poorer persons in such ways who may be glad of\r\nit--to English fighting; while if he represents Wellington as a mere\r\ncalculator and Napoleon as a hero, we can murmur politely (like a Roman\r\nCatholic bishop, more real in many ways than His Greatness of Digue),\r\n\"Perhaps so, my dear sir, perhaps so.\" But what has it all got to do\r\nhere? Even when Montalais and her lover sat on the wall and talked for\r\nhalf a volume or so in the _Vicomte de Bragelonne_; even when His\r\nMajesty Louis XIV. and his (one regrets to use the good old English\r\nword) pimp, M. le Duc de Saint-Aignan, exhausted the resources of\r\ncarpentry and the stores of printer's ink to gain access to the\r\napartment of Mlle. de la Vallière, the superabundance, though trivial,\r\nwas relevant: this is not. When Thénardier tried to rob and was no doubt\r\nquite ready to murder, but did, as a matter of fact, help to\r\nresuscitate, the gallant French Republican soldier, who was so glad to\r\nreceive the title of baron from an emperor who had by abdication\r\nresigned any right to give it that he ever possessed, it might have been\r\nMalplaquet or Leipsic, Fontenoy or Vittoria, for any relevance the\r\ndetails of the battle possessed to the course of the story.\r\n\r\nNow relevance (to make a short paragraph of the kind Hugo himself loved)\r\nis a mighty goddess in novelry.\r\n\r\nAnd so it continues, though, to be absolutely just, the later parts are\r\nnot exposed to quite the same objections as the earlier. These\r\nobjections transform themselves, however, into other varieties, and are\r\nreinforced by fresh faults. The most inexcusable digressions, on\r\nsubjects as remote from each other as convents and sewers, insist on\r\npoking themselves in. The central, or what ought to be the central,\r\ninterest itself turns on the ridiculous _émeute_ of Saint-Merry, a thing\r\n\"without a purpose or an aim,\" a mere caricature of a revolution. The\r\n_gamin_ Gavroche puts in a strong plea for mercy, and his sister\r\nEponine, if Hugo had chosen to take more trouble with her, might have\r\nbeen a great, and is actually the most interesting, character. But\r\nCosette--the cosseted Cosette--Hugo did not know our word or he would\r\nhave seen the danger--is merely a pretty and rather selfish little doll,\r\nand her precious lover Marius is almost ineffable.\r\n\r\nNovel-heroes who are failures throng my mind like ghosts on the other\r\nshore of the river whom Charon will not ferry over; but I can single out\r\nnone of them who is, without positively evil qualities, so absolutely\r\nintolerable as Marius.[103] Others have more such qualities; but he has\r\nno good ones. His very bravery is a sort of moral and intellectual\r\nrunning amuck because he thinks he shall not get Cosette. Having,\r\napparently, for many years thought and cared nothing about his father,\r\nhe becomes frantically filial on discovering that he has inherited from\r\nhim, as above, a very doubtful and certainly most un-\"citizen\"-like\r\ntitle of Baron. Thereupon (taking care, however, to have cards printed\r\nwith the title on them) he becomes a violent republican.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to be extremely rude to his indulgent but royalist\r\ngrandfather, retires to a mount of very peculiar sacredness, where he\r\ncomes in contact with the Thénardier family, discovers a plot against\r\nValjean, appeals to the civil arm to protect the victim, but, for\r\nreasons which seem good to him, turns tail, breaks his arranged part,\r\nand is very nearly accessory to a murder. At the other end of the story,\r\ncarrying out his general character of prig-pedant, as selfish as\r\nself-righteous, he meets Valjean's rather foolish and fantastic\r\nself-sacrifice with illiberal suspicion, and practically kills the poor\r\nold creature by separating him from Cosette. When the _éclaircissement_\r\ncomes, it appears to me--as Mr. Carlyle said of Loyola that he ought to\r\nhave consented to be damned--that Marius ought to have consented at\r\nleast to be kicked.\r\n\r\nOf course it may be said, \"You should not give judgments on things with\r\nwhich you are evidently out of sympathy.\" But I do not acknowledge any\r\npalpable hit. If certain purposes of the opposite kind were obtruded\r\nhere in the same fashion--if Victor (as he might have done in earlier\r\ndays) had hymned Royalism instead of Republicanism, or (as perhaps he\r\nwould never have done) had indulged in praise of severe laws and\r\nrestricted education,[104] and other things, I should be \"in sympathy,\"\r\nbut I hope and believe that I should not be \"out of\" criticism. Unless\r\nstrictly adjusted to the scale and degree suitable to a novel--as Sir\r\nWalter has, I think, restricted his Mariolatry and his Jacobitism, and\r\nso forth--I should bar them as I bar these.[105] And it is the fact that\r\nthey are not so restricted, with the concomitant faults which, again\r\npurely from the point of view of novel-criticism as such, I have\r\nventured to find, that makes me consider _Les Misérables_ a failure as a\r\nnovel. Once again, too, I find few of the really good and great\r\nthings--which in so vast a book by such a writer are there, and could\r\nnot fail to be there--to be essentially and specially good and great\r\naccording to the novel standard. They are, with the rarest exceptions,\r\nthe stuff of drama or of poetry, not of novel. That there are such\r\nexceptions--the treacherous feast of the students to the mistresses they\r\nare about to desert; the escapes of Valjean from the ambushes laid for\r\nhim by Thénardier and Javert; some of the Saint-Merry fighting; the\r\nguesting of the children by Gavroche in the elephant; and others--is\r\ntrue. But they are oases in a desert; and, save when they would be\r\nbetter done in poetry, they do not after all seem to me to be much\r\nbetter done than they might have been by others--the comparative\r\nweakness of Hugo in conversation of the kind suitable for prose fiction\r\nmaking itself felt. That at least is what the present writer's notion of\r\ncriticism puts into his mouth to say; and he can say no other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Les Travailleurs de la Mer._]\r\n\r\n_Les Travailleurs de la Mer_, on the other hand, is, according to some\r\npersons, among whom that present writer desires to be included, the\r\nsummit of Victor Hugo's achievements in prose fiction. It has his\r\n\"signatures\" of absurdity in fair measure. There is the celebrated\r\n\"Bug-Pipe\" which a Highlander of the garrison of Guernsey sold (I am\r\nafraid contrary to military law) to the hero, and on which that hero\r\nperformed the \"_melancholy_ air\" of \"Bonny Dundee.\"[106] There is the\r\nequally celebrated \"First of the Fourth\" (Première de la Quatrième),\r\nwhich is believed to be Hugonic for the Firth of Forth. There are some\r\nothers. There is an elaborate presentation of a quite impossibly named\r\nclergyman, who is, it seems, an anticipator of \"le Puseysme\" and an\r\nactual high-churchman, who talks as never high-churchman talked from\r\nLaud to Pusey himself, but rather like the Reverend Gabriel\r\nKettledrummle (with whom Hugo was probably acquainted \"in translations,\r\nSir! in translations\").[107] Gilliatt, the hero, is a not very human\r\nprig outside those extraordinary performances, of which more later, and\r\nhis consummate end. Déruchette, the heroine, is, like Cosette, a pretty\r\nnullity.[108] As always, the author _will_ not \"get under way\"; and\r\nshort as the book is, and valuable as is its shortness, it could be cut\r\ndown to two-thirds at least with advantage. Clubin and Rantaine, the\r\nvillains, are pure melodrama; Mess Lethierry, the good old man, is\r\nrather an old fool, and not so very good. The real business of the\r\nbook--the salvage by Gilliatt of the steamer wrecked on the Douvres--is,\r\nas a schoolboy would say, or would have said, \"jolly impossible.\" But\r\nthe book as a whole is, despite or because of its tragic quality, almost\r\nimpossibly \"jolly.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _genius loci._]\r\n\r\nFor here--as he did previously (by the help of the form that was more\r\nhis own and of Jersey) in the _Contemplations_--he had now got in prose,\r\nby that of the smaller, more isolated, and less contaminated[109]\r\nisland, into his own proper country, the dominion of the Angel of the\r\nVisions of the Sea. He has told us in his own grandiloquent way, which\r\nso often led him wrong, that when he settled to exile in the Channel\r\nIslands, his son François observed, \"Je traduirai Shakespeare,\" and _he_\r\nsaid, \"Je contemplerai l'océan.\" He did; and good came of it. Students\r\nof his biography may know that in the dwelling which he called\r\nHauteville House (a name which, I regret to say, already and properly\r\nbelonged to another) he slept and mainly lived in a high garret with\r\nmuch glass window, overlooking the strait between Guernsey and Sark.\r\nThese \"gazebos,\" as they used to be called, are common in St. Peter\r\nPort, and I myself enjoyed the possession of a more modest and quite\r\nunfamous one for some time. They are worth inhabiting and looking from,\r\nbe the weather fair or foul. Moreover, he was, I believe, a very good\r\nwalker, and in both the islands made the best of opportunities which are\r\nunmatched elsewhere. Whether he boated much I do not know. The profusion\r\nof nautical terms with which he \"deaves\" us (as the old Scotch word has\r\nit) would rather lead me to think _not_. He was in this inferior to\r\nProspero; but I hope it is not blasphemy to say that, _mutatis\r\nmutandis_, he had something of the banished Duke of Milan in him, and\r\nthat, in the one case as in the other, it was the island that brought it\r\nout. And he acknowledged it in his Dedication to \"Guernesey--_sevère et\r\ndouce_.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guernsey at the time.]\r\n\r\n_Sevère et Douce!_ I lived in Guernsey as a Master at Elizabeth College\r\nfrom 1868, two years after Victor Hugo wrote that dedication, to 1874,\r\nwhen he still kept house there, but had not, since the \"Année Terrible,\"\r\noccupied it much. I suppose the \"severity\" must be granted to an island\r\nof solid granite and to the rocks and tides and sea-mists that surround\r\nit. But in the ordinary life there in my time there was little to\r\n\"asperate\" the _douceur_. Perhaps it does not require so very much to\r\nsweeten things in general between the ages of twenty-three and\r\ntwenty-nine. But the things in general themselves were dulcet enough.\r\nThe beauty of the place--extraordinarily varied in its triangle of some\r\nhalf-score miles or a little less on each side--was not then in the\r\nleast interfered with by the excessive commercial glass-housing which, I\r\nbelieve, has come in since. For what my friend of many days, the late\r\nMr. Reynolds of Brasenose and East Ham, a constant visitor in summer,\r\nused to call \"necessary luxuries,\" it was still unique. When I went\r\nthere you could buy not undrinkable or poisonous Hollands at four\r\nshillings a gallon, and brandy--not, of course, exactly cognac or _fine\r\nchampagne_, but deserving the same epithets--for six. If you were a\r\nluxurious person, you paid half-a-crown a bottle for the genuine produce\r\nof the Charente, little or not at all inferior to Martell or Hennessy,\r\nand a florin for excellent Scotch or Irish whiskey.[110] Fourpence\r\nhalf-penny gave you a quarter-pound slab of gold-leaf tobacco, than\r\nwhich I never wish to smoke better.\r\n\r\nBut this easy supplying of the bodily needs of the \"horse with wings\"\r\nand his \"heavy rider\" was as nothing to other things which strengthened\r\nthe wings of the spirit and lightened the weight of the burden it bore.\r\nI have not been a great traveller outside the kingdom of England: and\r\nyou may doubtless, in the whole of Europe or of the globe, find more\r\nmagnificent things than you can possibly find in an island of the\r\ndimensions given. But for a miniature and manageable assemblage of\r\namenities I do not think you can easily beat Guernsey. The town of St.\r\nPeter Port, and its two castles, Fort George above and Castle Cornet\r\nbelow, looking on the strait above mentioned, with the curiously\r\ncontrasted islets of Herm and Jethou in its midst; the wonderful coast,\r\nfirst south- and then westward, set with tiny coves of perfection like\r\nBec-du-Nez, and larger bays, across the mouth of which, after a storm\r\nand in calm sunny weather, you see lines of foam stretching from\r\nheadland to headland, out of the white clots of which the weakest\r\nimagination can fancy Aphrodite rising and floating shorewards, to\r\nvanish as she touches the beach; the great western promontory of\r\nPleinmont, a scarcely lessened Land's End, with the Hanois rocks beyond;\r\nthe tamer but still not tame western, northern, and north-eastern\r\ncoasts, with the Druid-haunted level of L'Ancresse and the minor port of\r\nSt. Samson--all these furnish, even to the well-girt man, an\r\nextraordinary number[111] of walks, ranging from an hour's to a day's\r\nand more there and back; while in the valleys of the interior you find\r\nscenery which might be as far from the sea as Warwickshire, or on the\r\nheights springs which tell you that they must have come from the\r\nneighbourhood of the Mount of Dol or the Forest of Broceliande.\r\n\r\nWith such colour and form of locality to serve, not merely as\r\ninspiration but as actual scene and setting, such genius as Hugo's could\r\nhardly fail. The thing is sad and delightful and great. As life, you may\r\nsay, it could not have happened; as literature it could not but have\r\nhappened, and has happened, at its best, divinely well. The contrast of\r\nthe long agony of effort and its triumph on the Douvres, with the swift\r\ncollapse of any possible reward at St. Samson, is simply a windfall of\r\nthe Muses to this spoiled and, it must be confessed, often self-spoiling\r\nchild of theirs. There are, of course, absurdities still, and of a\r\ndifferent kind from the bug-pipe. I have always wished to know what the\r\nexperiences of the fortunate and reverend but sheepish Ebenezer had been\r\nat Oxford--he must certainly have held a King Charles scholarship in his\r\nday--during that full-blooded time of the Regency. The circumstances of\r\nthe marriage are almost purely Hugonian, though it does Hugo credit that\r\nhe admires the service which he travesties so remarkably. But the _Dieu_\r\n(not _diable_) _au corps_ which he now enjoys enables him to change into\r\na beauty (in the wholly natural gabble of Mess Lethierry on the recovery\r\nof the _la Durande_) those long speeches which have been already noted\r\nas blots. And, beauty or blot, it would not have mattered. All is in the\r\ncontrast of the mighty but conquered Douvres and the comparatively\r\ninsignificant rocklet--there are hundreds like it on every granite\r\ncoast--where Death the Consoler sets on Gilliatt's head the only crown\r\npossible for his impossible feat, and where the dislike of the ignorant\r\npeasantry, the brute resistance of machinery and material, the violence\r\nof the storm, the devilish ambush of the _pieuvre_, and all other evils\r\nare terminated and evaded and sanctified by the embrace and the\r\neuthanasia of the sea. Perhaps it is poetry rather than novel or even\r\nromance--in substance it is too abstract and elemental for either of the\r\nless majestical branches of inventive literature. But it is great. \"By\r\nGod! 'tis good,\" and, to lengthen somewhat Ben's famous challenge, \"if\r\nyou like, you may\" put it with, and not so far from, in whatever order\r\nyou please--the deaths of Cleopatra and of Colonel Newcome.\r\n\r\nThe book is therefore a success; but that success is an evident _tour de\r\nforce_, and it is nearly as evident to any student of the subject that\r\nsuch a _tour de force_ was not likely to be repeated, and that the thing\r\nowed its actual salvage to a rather strict limitation of subject and\r\ntreatment--a limitation hitherto unknown in the writer and itself\r\nunlikely to recur. Also that there were certain things in it--especially\r\nthe travesties of names and subjects of which the author practically\r\nknew nothing--the repetition and extension of which _was_ likely to be\r\ndamaging, if not fatal. In two or three years the \"fatality\" of which\r\nVictor Hugo himself was dangerously fond of talking (the warning of\r\nHerodotus in the dawn about things which it is not lawful to mention\r\nhas been too often neglected) had its revenge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _L'Homme Qui Rit._]\r\n\r\n_L'Homme Qui Rit_ is probably the maddest book in recognised literature;\r\ncertainly the maddest written by an author of supreme genius without the\r\nfaintest notion that he was making himself ridiculous. The genius is\r\nstill there, and passage on passage shows us the real \"prose-poetry,\"\r\nthat is to say, the prose which ought to have been written in verse. The\r\nscheme of the quartette--Ursus, the misanthrope-Good-Samaritan; Homo,\r\nthe amiable wolf; Gwynplaine, the tortured and guiltless child and\r\nyouth; Dea, the adorable maiden--is unexceptionable _per se_, and it\r\ncould have been worked out in verse or drama perfectly, though the\r\nactual termination--Gwynplaine's suicide in the sea after Dea's\r\ndeath--is perhaps too close and too easy a \"variation of the same thing\"\r\non Gilliatt's parallel self-immolation after Déruchette's marriage.[112]\r\nNot a few opening or episodic parts--the picture of the caravan; the\r\nstruggle of the child Gwynplaine with the elements to save not so much\r\nhimself as the baby Dea; the revulsions of his temptations and\r\npersecutions later; and yet others[113]--show the poet and the master.\r\n\r\nBut the way in which these things are merged in and spoilt by a torrent\r\nof silliness, sciolism, and sheer nonsense is, even after one has known\r\nthe book for forty years and more, still astounding.\r\n\r\nOne could laugh almost indulgently over the \"bug-pipe\" and the \"First of\r\nthe Fourth\"; one could, being of those who win, laugh quite indulgently\r\nover the little outbursts of spite in _Les Travailleurs_ at the\r\ninstitutions and ways of the country which had, despite some rather\r\nunpardonable liberties, given its regular and royal asylum to the\r\nexiled republican and almost anarchist author. Certainly, also, one can\r\nlaugh over _L'Homme Qui Rit_ and its picture of the English aristocracy.\r\nBut of such laughter, as of all carnal pleasures (to steal from\r\nKingsley), cometh satiety, and the satiety is rather early reached in\r\nthis same book. One of the chief \"persons of distinction\" in many ways\r\nwhom I have ever come across, the late Mr. G. S. Venables--a lawyer of\r\nno mean expertness; one of the earliest and one of the greatest of those\r\n\"gentlemen of the Press\" who at the middle of the nineteenth century\r\nlifted journalism out of the gutter; a familiar of every kind of the\r\nbest society, and a person of infinite though somewhat saturnine\r\nwit--had a phrase of contempt for absurd utterances by persons who ought\r\nto have known better. \"It was,\" he said, \"like a drunk child.\" The major\r\npart of _L'Homme Qui Rit_ is like the utterance of a drunk child who had\r\nsomething of the pseudo-Homeric Margites in him, who \"knew a great many\r\nthings and knew them all badly.\" I could fill fifty pages here easily\r\nenough, and with a kind of low amusement to myself and perhaps others,\r\nby enumerating the absurdities of _L'Homme Qui Rit_. As far as I\r\nremember, when the book appeared, divers good people (the bad people\r\nmerely sneered) took immense pains to discover how and why this great\r\nman of letters made so much greater a fool of himself. This was quite\r\nlost labour; and without attempting the explanation at all, a very small\r\nselection of the facts, being in a manner indispensable, may be given.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious society of \"Comprachicos\" (Spanish for \"child-buyers\"),\r\non whose malpractices the whole book is founded; the entirely false\r\nconception of the English House of Lords, which gives much of the\r\nsuperstructure; the confusion of English and French times and seasons,\r\nmanners and customs, which enables the writer to muddle up Henri-Trois\r\nand Louis-Quinze, Good Queen Bess and Good Queen Anne: these and other\r\nthings of the kind can be passed over. For things like some of them\r\noccur in much saner novelists than Hugo; and Sir Walter himself is\r\nnotoriously not free from indisputable anachronisms.[114] But you have\r\nbarely reached the fiftieth page when you come to a \"Lord Linnæus\r\nClancharlie, Baron Clancharlie et Hunkerville, Marquis de Corleone en\r\nSicile,\" whose English peerage dates from Edward _the Elder_ (the origin\r\nof his Sicilian title is not stated, but it was probably conferred by\r\nHiero or Dionysius), and whose name \"Clancharlie\" has nothing whatever\r\nto do with Scotland or Ireland. This worthy peer (who, as a Cromwellian,\r\nexiled himself after the Restoration) had, like others of the godly, a\r\nbastard son, enjoying at \"_temp._ of tale\" the remarkable courtesy title\r\nof \"Lord David Dirry-Moir,\" but called by the rabble, with whom his\r\nsporting tastes make him a great favourite, \"Tom-Jim-Jack.\" Most\r\n\"love-children\" of peers would be contented (if they ever had them) with\r\ncourtesy titles; but Lord David has been further favoured by Fortune and\r\nKing James II., who has first induced the _comprachicos_ to trepan and\r\nmutilate Clancharlie's real heir (afterwards Gwynplaine, the eponymous\r\nhero of the book), and has then made Lord David a \"_pair\r\nsubstitué_\"[115] on condition that he marries one of the king's natural\r\ndaughters, the Duchess Josiane, a duchess with no duchy ever mentioned.\r\nIn regard to her Hugo proceeds to exhibit his etymological powers,\r\nignoring entirely the agreeable heroine of _Bevis of Hampton_, and\r\nsuggesting either an abbreviation of \"Josefa y Ana\" (at this time, we\r\nare gravely informed, there was a prevalent English fashion of taking\r\nSpanish names) or else a feminine of \"Josias.\" Moreover, among dozens of\r\nother instances of this Bedlam nomenclature, we have a \"combat of box\"\r\nbetween the Irishman \"Phelem-ghe-Madone\" (because Irishmen are often\r\nRoman Catholics?) and the Scotchman \"Helmsgail\" (there is a place\r\ncalled Helms_dale_ in Scotland, and if \"gael\" why not \"gail\"?), to the\r\nlatter of whom a knee is given by \"Lord Desertum\" (Desart? Dysart?\r\nwhat?).\r\n\r\nAnd so it goes on. There is the immortal scene (or rather half-volume)\r\nin which, Hugo having heard or read of _peine forte et dure_, we find\r\nsheriffs who discharge the duty of Old Bailey judges, fragments of Law\r\nLatin (it is really a pity that he did not get hold of our inimitable\r\nLaw _French_), and above all, and pervading all, that most fearful\r\nwildfowl the \"wapentake,\" with his \"iron weapon.\" He, with his satellite\r\nthe justicier-quorum (but, one weeps to see, not \"custalorum\" or\r\n\"rotalorum\"), is concerned with the torture of Hardquanonne[116]--the\r\noriginal malefactor[117] in Gwynplaine's case--and thereby restores\r\nGwynplaine to his (unsubstituted) rank in the English peerage, when he\r\nhimself is anticipating similar treatment. There is the presentation by\r\nthe librarian of the House of Lords of a \"little red book\" which is the\r\npassport to the House itself: and the very unmannerly reception by his\r\nbrother peers, from which he is in a manner rescued by the chivalrous\r\nLord David Dirry-Moir at the price of a box on the ears for depriving\r\nhim of his \"substitution.\" There is the misconduct of the Duchess\r\nJosiane, divinely beautiful and diabolically wicked, who covets the\r\nmonster Gwynplaine as a lover, and discards him when, on his\r\npeerification, he is commanded to her by Queen Anne as a husband. And\r\nthen, after all this tedious insanity and a great deal more, there is\r\nthe finale of the despair of Gwynplaine, of his recovery of the dying\r\nDea in a ship just starting for Holland, of her own death, and of his\r\nsuicide in the all-healing sea--a \"reconciliation\" not far short of the\r\ngreatest things in literature.\r\n\r\nNow I am not of those unhappy ones who cannot away with the mixture of\r\ntragedy and farce. I have not only read too much, but lived too long for\r\nthat. But then the farce must be in life conceivable and in literature\r\nconscious. Shakespeare, and even men much inferior to Shakespeare, have\r\nbeen able to provide for this stipulation munificently.\r\n\r\nWith Victor Hugo, generally more or less and intensively here, it was\r\nunfortunately different. His irony was almost always his weakest point;\r\nor rather it was a kind of hit-or-miss weapon, with which he cut himself\r\nas often as he cut his inimical objects or persons. The intense\r\nabsurdity of his personified wapentakes, of his Tom-Jim-Jacks, of his\r\ncourtesy-title bastards, he deliberately declined (as in the anecdote\r\nabove given) to see. But these things, done and evidently thought fine\r\nby the doer, almost put to rout the most determined and expert sifter of\r\nthe faults and merits of genius. You cannot enjoy a Garden of Eden when\r\nat every other step you plunge into a morass of mire. You cannot drink a\r\ndraught of nectar, arranged on the plan of certain glasses of liqueur,\r\nin superimposed layers of different savour and colour, when every other\r\nlayer is \"stummed\" folly or nauseous bad taste. A novel is not like a\r\nbook of poems, where, as you see that you have hit on a failure, you\r\nturn the page and find a success. To which it may be added finally that\r\nwhile erudition of _any_ kind is a doubtful set-off to fiction, the\r\npresentation of ragbag erudition of this kind is, to speak moderately\r\nand in his own words of something else, \"a rather hideous thing.\"[118]\r\n\r\nStill, with readers of a certain quality, the good omens may to some\r\nextent shame the ill even here. The death of Dea, with its sequel, is\r\nvery nearly perfect; it only wants the verse of which its author was\r\nsuch an absolute master, instead of the prose, where he alternately\r\ntriumphed and bungled, to make it so. And one need not be a common\r\nparadoxer to take either side on the question whether on the whole the\r\nomen, if not the actuality, of _L'Homme Qui Rit_ or that of _Les\r\nTravailleurs de la Mer_ was the happier. For, while the earlier and\r\nbetter book showed how faults were hardening and might grow worse still,\r\nthe later showed how these very faults, attaining their utmost possible\r\ndevelopment, could not entirely stifle the rarer gifts. I do not\r\nremember that anybody in 1869 took this apparently aleatory side of the\r\nargument. If he did he was justified in 1874.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Quatre-Vingt-Treize._]\r\n\r\nOne enormous advantage of _Quatre-Vingt-Treize_ over its immediate\r\npredecessor lay on the surface--an advantage enormous in all cases, but\r\nalmost incalculable in this particular one. In _L'Homme Qui Rit_ Victor\r\nHugo had been dealing with a subject about which he knew practically\r\nnothing, and about which he was prepared to believe, or even practise,\r\nanything. Here, though he was still prepared to believe a great deal, he\r\nyet knew a very great deal more. A little room for his eccentricities\r\nremained, and long after the truth had become a matter of registered\r\nhistory, he could accept the legendary lies about the _Vengeur_; but\r\nthere was no danger of his giving us French wapentakes brandishing\r\niron-weapons, or calling a French noble by any appellation comparable to\r\nLord Linnæus[119] Clancharlie.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be said, is not the removal of these annoyances more than\r\ncompensated, in the bad sense, by things inseparable from such a\r\nsubject, as treated by such an author?--the glorification of\r\n\"Quatre-Vingt-Treize\" itself, and, in particular, of the\r\nConvention--that remarkable assembly which seems to have made up its\r\nmind to prove for all time that, in democracies, the scum comes to the\r\ntop?--that assembly in which Fabre d'Eglantine stood for poetry, Marat\r\nfor humanitarianism, Robespierre for justice, Hébert and Chaumette for\r\ndecency, Siéyès and Chabot for different forms of religion, the\r\ncomposers of the Republican Calendar[120] for common sense? where the\r\nonly suggestion of a great man was Danton, and the only substitutes for\r\nan honest one were the prigs and pedants of the Gironde? To which the\r\nonly critical answer must be, even when the critic does not contest the\r\ncorrectness of this description--\"Why, no!\"\r\n\r\nIt is better, no doubt, that a novelist, and that everybody else, should\r\nbe a _bien-pensant_; but, as in the case of the poet, it will not\r\nnecessarily affect his goodness in his art if he is not. He had, indeed,\r\nbest not air his opinions, whatever they are, at too great length; but\r\n_what_ they are matters little or nothing. A Tory critic who cannot\r\nadmire Shelley or Swinburne, Dickens or Thackeray, because of their\r\npolitics, is merely an ass, an animal unfortunately to be found in the\r\nstables or paddocks of every party. On the other hand, absurdities and\r\nfaults of taste matter very much.\r\n\r\nNow from these latter, which had nearly ruined _L'Homme Qui Rit_,\r\n_Quatre-Vingt-Treize_, if not entirely free, suffers comparatively\r\nlittle. The early and celebrated incident of the carronade running amuck\r\nshows characteristic neglect of burlesque possibilities (and, as I\r\nbelieve some experts have maintained, of actual ones), but it has the\r\nqualities of the Hugonian defects. An arm-chair critic may ask, Where\r\nwas the English fleet in the Channel when a French one was allowed to\r\ncome out and slowly mob the _Claymore_ to destruction, without, as far\r\nas one sees, any interference or counter-effort, though the expedition\r\nof that remarkable corvette formed part of an elaborate and carefully\r\nprepared offensive?[121] Undoubtedly, the Convention scenes must be\r\nallowed--even by sympathisers with the Revolution--to be clumsy\r\nstopgaps, unnecessary to the action and possessed of little intrinsic\r\nvalue in themselves. The old fault of verbosity and \"watering out\"\r\nrecurs; and so does the reappearance, with very slight change, of\r\nfigures and situations. Cimourdain in character is very much of a more\r\nrespectable Claude Frollo; and in conduct, _mutatis_ not so very many\r\n_mutandis_, almost as much of a less respectable Javert. The death of\r\nGauvain is far less effective than that of Sydney Carton, which had\r\npreceded it; and the enormous harangue of the Marquis to the nephew who\r\nis about to liberate him, though it may be intended to heighten the\r\n_peripeteia_, merely gives fresh evidence of Hugo's want of proportion\r\nand of his flux of rhetoric.\r\n\r\nAll this and more is true; yet _Quatre-Vingt-Treize_ is, \"in its _fine_\r\nwrong way,\" a great book, and with _Les Travailleurs de la Mer_,\r\ncompletes the pillars, such as they are, which support Hugo's position\r\nas a novelist. The rescue of the children by Lantenac is superb, though\r\nyou may find twenty cavils against it easily: and the whole presentation\r\nof the Marquis, except perhaps the speech referred to, is one of the\r\nbest pictures of the _ancienne noblesse_ in literature, one which--to\r\nreverse the contrast just made--annihilates Dickens's caricature thereof\r\nin _A Tale of Two Cities_. The single-handed defence of La Tourgue by\r\n\"L'Imanus\" has of course a good deal of the hyperbole which began with\r\nQuasimodo's similar act in _Notre-Dame_; but the reader who cannot \"let\r\nhimself go\" with it is to be pitied. Nowhere is Hugo's child-worship\r\nmore agreeably shown than in the three first chapters of the third\r\nvolume. And, sinking particulars for a more general view, one may say\r\nthat through the whole book, to an extent surpassing even _Les\r\nTravailleurs de la Mer_ as such, there is the great Victorian _souffle_\r\nand surge, the rush as of mighty winds and mightier waters, which\r\ncarries the reader resistlessly through and over all obstacles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Final remarks.]\r\n\r\nYet although Hugo thus terminated his career as a novelist, if not in\r\nthe odour of sanctity, at any rate in a comfortable cloud of incense due\r\nto a comparative success; although he had (it is true on a much smaller\r\nscale) even transcended that success in _Les Travailleurs de la Mer_;\r\nalthough, as a mere novice, he had proved himself a more than tolerable\r\ntale-teller in _Bug-Jargal_, it is not possible, for any critical\r\nhistorian of the novel as such, to pronounce him a great artist, or even\r\na tolerable craftsman, in the kind as a whole. It has already been\r\nseveral times remarked in detail, and may now be repeated in general,\r\nthat the things which we enjoy in his books of this kind are seldom\r\nthings which it is the special business of the novelist to produce, and\r\npractically never those which are his chief business. In no single\r\ninstance perhaps, with the doubtful exception of Gilliatt's battle with\r\nbrute matter and elemental forces, is \"the tale the thing\" purely as\r\ntale. Very seldom do we even want to know what is going to happen--the\r\nchildishly simple, but also childishly genuine demand of the reader of\r\nromance as such, if not even of the novel also. Scarcely once do we--at\r\nleast do I--take that interest in the development of character which is\r\nthe special subject of appetite of readers of the novel, as such and by\r\nitself. The baits and the rewards are now splendour of style; now\r\nmagnificence of imagery; sometimes grandeur of idea; often pathos; not\r\nseldom the delight of battle in this or that sense. These are all\r\nexcellent seasonings of novelry; but they are not the root of the\r\nmatter, the _pièce de résistance_ of the feast.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, too, Hugo not merely cannot, or at any rate does not,\r\ngive the hungry sheep their proper food--an interesting story worked out\r\nby interesting characters--but will persist in giving them things as\r\nsuitable (granting them to be in the abstract nourishing) as turnips to\r\nthe carnivora or legs of mutton to the sheep which walk on them. It\r\nwould, of course, not be just to press too strongly the objections to\r\nthe novel of purpose, though to the present writer they seem almost\r\ninsuperable. But it is not merely purpose in the ordinary sense which\r\nleads Victor astray, or rather (for he was much too wilful a person to\r\nbe led) which he invents for himself to follow, with his eyes open, and\r\nknowing perfectly well what he is doing. His digressions are not\r\n_parabases_ of the kind which some people object to in Fielding and\r\nstill more in Thackeray--addresses to the reader on points more or less\r\nintimately connected with the subject itself. A certain exception has\r\nbeen made in favour of some of the architectural parts of _Notre-Dame de\r\nParis_, but it has been admitted that this will not cover \"Ceci Tuera\r\nCela\" nor much else. For the presence of the history of the sewers of\r\nParis in _Les Misérables_ and any number of other things; for not a\r\nlittle of the first volume of _Les Travailleurs_ itself; for about half,\r\nif not more, of _L'Homme Qui Rit_, starting from Ursus's Black-book of\r\nfancy pleasances, palaces, and estates belonging to the fellow-peers of\r\nLord Linnæus Clancharlie and Hunkerville; for not a few chapters even of\r\n_Quatre-Vingt-Treize_, there is no excuse at all. They are simply\r\nrepulsive or at least unwelcome \"pledgets\" of unsucculent matter stuck\r\ninto the body of fiction, as (but with how different results!) _lardons_\r\nor pistachios or truffles are stuck into another kind of composition.\r\n\r\nIt is partly, but not wholly, due to this deplorable habit of irrelevant\r\ndivagation that Hugo will never allow his stories to \"march\" (at least\r\nto begin with marching),[122] _Quatre-Vingt-Treize_ being here the only\r\nexception among the longer romances, for even _Les Travailleurs de la\r\nMer_ never gets into stride till nearly the whole of the first volume is\r\npassed. But the habit, however great a nuisance it may be to the reader,\r\nis of some interest to the student and the historian, for the very\r\nreason that it does not seem to be wholly an outcome of the other habit\r\nof digression. It would thus be, in part at least, a survival of that\r\nodd old \"inability to begin\" which we noticed several times in the last\r\nvolume, aggravated by the irrepressible wilfulness of the writer, and by\r\nhis determination not to do like other people, who _had_ by this time\r\nmostly got over the difficulty.\r\n\r\nIf any further \"dull moral\" is wanted it may be the obvious lesson that\r\noverpowering popularity of a particular form is sometimes a misfortune,\r\nas that of allegory was in the Middle Ages and that of didactics in the\r\neighteenth century. If it had not been almost incumbent on any Frenchman\r\nwho aimed at achieving popularity in the mid-nineteenth century to\r\nattempt the novel, it is not very likely that Hugo would have attempted\r\nit. It may be doubted whether we should have lost any of the best\r\nthings--we should only have had them in the compacter and higher shape\r\nof more _Orientales_, more _Chants du Crépuscule_, more _Légendes_, and\r\nso forth. We should have lost the easily losable laugh over bug-pipe and\r\nwapentake--for though Hugo sometimes _thought_ sillily in verse he did\r\nnot often let silliness touch his expression in the more majestical\r\nharmony--and we should have been spared an immensely greater body of\r\nmatter which now provokes a yawn or a sigh.\r\n\r\nThis is, it may be said, after all a question of taste. Perhaps. But it\r\ncan hardly be denied by any critical student of fiction that while\r\nHugo's novel-work has added much splendid matter to literature, it has\r\npractically nowhere advanced, nor even satisfactorily exemplified, the\r\nart of the novel. It is here as an exception--marvellous, magnificent,\r\nand as such to be fully treated; actually an honour to the art of which\r\nit discards the requirements, but an exception merely and one which\r\nproves, inasmuch as it justifies, the cautions it defies.[123]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[93] Mr. Swinburne's magnificent pæans are \"vatical\" certainly, but\r\nscarcely critical, save now and then. Mr. Stevenson wrote on the\r\nRomances, but not on \"the whole.\"\r\n\r\n[94] See note in Vol. I. p. 472 of this _History_, and in the present\r\nvolume, _sup._ p. 40.\r\n\r\n[95] These crazes were not in origin, though they probably were in\r\ninfluence, political: Hugo held more than one of them while he was still\r\na Royalist.\r\n\r\n[96] She is of course not really Spanish or a gipsy, but is presented as\r\nsuch at first.\r\n\r\n[97] Stated in the Preface to _Cromwell_, the critical division of his\r\nfourfold attack on neo-Classicism, as _Les Orientales_ were the\r\npoetical, _Hernani_ was the dramatic, and _Notre-Dame_ itself the\r\nprose-narrative.\r\n\r\n[98] It is scarcely excessive to say that this mixture of wilful temper\r\nand unbridled theorising was the Saturnian influence, or the \"infortune\r\nof Mart,\" in Hugo's horoscope throughout.\r\n\r\n[99] Unless anybody chooses to say that the gallows and the guillotine\r\nare Hugo's monsters here.\r\n\r\n[100] The failure of the riskiest and most important scene of the whole\r\n(where her surrender of herself to Phoebus is counteracted by Frollo's\r\nstabbing the soldier, the act itself leading to Esmeralda's\r\nincarceration) is glaring.\r\n\r\n[101] _Le Beau Pécopin_ in his _Rhine_-book is, of course, fairly\r\nsubstantial in one sense, but it is only an episode or inset-tale in\r\nsomething else, which is neither novel or romance.\r\n\r\n[102] It must be four or five times the length of Scott's average, more\r\nthan twice that of the longest books with which Dickens and Thackeray\r\nused to occupy nearly two years in monthly instalments, and very nearly,\r\nif not quite, that of Dumas' longest and most \"spun-out\" achievements in\r\n_Monte Cristo_, the _Vicomte de Bragelonne_ and _La Comtesse de Charny_.\r\n\r\n[103] I am not forgetting or contradicting what was said above (page 26)\r\nof René. But René _does_ very little except when he kills the\r\nshe-beavers; Marius is always doing something, and doing it offensively.\r\n\r\n[104] The \"Je ne sais pas lire\" argument has more than once suggested to\r\nme a certain historical comparison. There have probably never been in\r\nall history two more abominable scoundrels for cold-blooded cruelty, the\r\nworst of all vices, than Eccelino da Romano and the late Mr. Broadhead,\r\npatron saint and great exemplar of Trade-Unionism. Broadhead could\r\ncertainly read. Could Ezzelin? I do not know. But if he could not, the\r\nHugonic belief in the efficacy of reading is not strongly supported. If\r\nhe could, it is definitely damaged.\r\n\r\n[105] _Vide_ what is said below on _Quatre-Vingt-Treize_.\r\n\r\n[106] After the lapse of more than half a century some readers may have\r\nforgotten, and more may never have heard, the anecdote connected with\r\nthis. It was rashly and somewhat foolishly pointed out to the\r\npoet-romancer himself that the air of \"Bonny Dundee\" was the very\r\nreverse of melancholy, and that he must have mistaken the name. His\r\nreply was the most categoric declaration possible of his general\r\nattitude, in such cases, \"Et moi, je l'appelle 'Bonny Dundee.'\" _Victor\r\nlocutus est: causa finita est_ (he liked tags of not recondite Latin\r\nhimself). And the leading case governs those of the bug-pipe and the\r\n(later) wapentake and _justicier-quorum_, and all the other wondrous\r\nthings of which but a few can be mentioned here.\r\n\r\n[107] I do not know whether any one has ever attempted to estimate his\r\nactual debt to Scott. There are better classics of inquiry, but in the\r\nclass many worse subjects.\r\n\r\n[108] In the opening scene she is something worse. If her writing\r\n\"Gilliatt\" in the snow had been a sort of rustic challenge of the \"malo\r\nme petit, et fugit ad salices\" kind, there might have been something\r\n(not much) to say for her. But she did not know Gilliatt; she did not\r\nwant to know him; and the proceeding was either mere silly childishness,\r\nor else one of those pieces of bad taste of which her great creator was\r\nunluckily by no means incapable.\r\n\r\n[109] I use this adjective in no contumelious sense, and certainly not\r\nbecause I have lived in Guernsey and only visited Jersey. To the\r\nimpartial denizen of either, the rivalry of the two is as amusing as is\r\nthat of Edinburgh and Glasgow, of Liverpool and Manchester, or of\r\nBradford and Leeds. But, at any rate at the time of which I am speaking,\r\nJersey was much more haunted by outsiders (in several senses of that\r\nword) than Guernsey. Residents--whether for the purposes unblushingly\r\navowed by that sometime favourite of the stage, Mr. Eccles, or for the\r\nreasons less horrifying to the United Kingdom Alliance--found themselves\r\nmore at home in \"Caesarea\" than in \"Sarnia,\" and the \"five-pounder,\" as\r\nthe summer tripper was despiteously called by natives, liked to go as\r\nfar as he could for his money, and found St. Helier's \"livelier\" than\r\nSt. Peter Port.\r\n\r\n[110] Really good wines were proportionally cheap; but the little isle\r\nwas not quite so good at beer, except some remarkable old ale, which one\r\nsmall brewery had ventured on, and which my friends of the 22nd Regiment\r\ndiscovered and (very wisely) drank up.--It may surprise honest fanatics\r\nand annoy others to hear that, despite the cheapness and abundance of\r\ntheir bugbear, there was no serious crime of any kind in Guernsey during\r\nthe six years I knew it, and no disorder worth speaking of, even among\r\nsailors and newly arrived troops.\r\n\r\n[111] The shape of the island; the position of its only \"residential\"\r\ntown of any size in the middle of one of the coasts, so that the roads\r\nspread fan-wise from it; the absence of any large flat space except in\r\nthe northern parish of \"The Vale\"; the geological formation which tends,\r\nas in Devonshire, to sink the roads into deep and sometimes \"water\"\r\nlanes; lastly, perhaps, the extreme subdivision of property, which\r\nmultiplies the ways of communication--these things contribute to this\r\n\"_pedestrian_-paradise\" character. There are many places where, with\r\nplenty of good walking \"objectives,\" you can get to none of them without\r\na disgusting repetition of the same initial grind. In Guernsey, except\r\nas regards the sea, which never wearies, there is no such even partial\r\nmonotony.\r\n\r\n[112] It is well known that even among great writers this habit of\r\nduplication is often, though very far from always, present. Hugo is\r\nspecially liable to it. The oddest example I remember is that the\r\napproach to the Dutch ship at the end of _L'Homme Qui Rit_ reproduces on\r\nthe Thames almost exactly the details of the iron gate of the sewers on\r\nthe Seine, where Thénardier treacherously exposes Valjean to the\r\nclutches of Javert, in _Les Misérables_, though of course the use made\r\nof it is quite different.\r\n\r\n[113] It must be remembered that this also belongs to the Channel\r\nIslands division: and the Angel of the Sea has still some part in it.\r\n\r\n[114] Those of _Ivanhoe_ and _Kenilworth_ have enraged pedants and\r\namused the elect for a century. But I do not remember much notice being\r\ntaken of that jump of half a millennium and one year more in _The\r\nTalisman_, where Count Henry of Champagne \"smiles like a sparkling\r\ngoblet of his own wine.\" This was in 1192, while the ever-blessed Dom\r\nPérignon did not make champagne \"sparkle\" till 1693. Idolatry may\r\nsuggest that \"sparkling\" is a perpetual epithet of wine; but I fear this\r\nwill not do.\r\n\r\n[115] _Substitué_ means \"entailed\" in technical French. But I know no\r\ninstance of this kind of \"contingent remainder\" in England.\r\n\r\n[116] A compound (as Victor himself might suggest) of \"Hardyknut\" and\r\n\"Sine qua non\"? Or \"Hardbake\"?\r\n\r\n[117] He has been found out through the agency of one \"Barkilphedro\"\r\n(Barkis-Phaedrus?), an Irishman of familiar sept, who is \"Decanter of\r\nthe Bottles of the Sea,\" and who finds, in one of his trovers, a\r\nderelict gourd of confession thrown overboard by the Comprachicos when\r\nwrecked (in another half-volume earlier) all over the Channel from\r\nPortland to Alderney.\r\n\r\n[118] Perhaps there is no more conspicuous instance of irritating\r\nfutility in this way than the famous [Greek: anagkê] and [Greek:\r\nanagneia] of _Notre-Dame_. Of course anybody who knows no Greek can see\r\nthat the first four letters of the two words are the same. But anybody\r\nwho knows some Greek knows that the similarity is purely _literal_, such\r\nas exists between \"Chateaubriand\" and \"Chat Botté\" and that the [Greek:\r\nan] has a different origin in the two cases. Moreover, [Greek:\r\nanagneia], \"uncleanness,\" is about the last word one would choose to\r\nexpress the _liaison_ of thought--\"The dread constraint of physical\r\npassion\" or \"Lust is Fate\"--which Hugo wishes to indicate. It is a mere\r\njingle, suggestive of a schoolboy turning over the dictionary.\r\n\r\n[119] That the only person at all likely to be \"name-father\" of this\r\nname was not born till a considerable time after his name-child's death\r\nwould perhaps be worth remarking in another writer. In Hugo it hardly\r\ncounts.\r\n\r\n[120] Let me do even _them_ one justice in this connection. They did not\r\nsuppose that the only way to make people get up earlier was to make\r\nthese people's clocks and watches tell lies.\r\n\r\n[121] There is a smaller point which might be taken up. Undoubtedly\r\nthere were many double traitors on both sides in the other Great War.\r\nBut, like all their kind, they had a knack for being found out. Dumas\r\nwould, I think, have given us something satisfactory as to the\r\n\"aristocrat\" at Jersey who betrayed the _Claymore_ to the Revolutionary\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n[122] It is impossible, with him, not to think of Baudelaire's great\r\nline in _L'Albatros_ (which some may have read even before _Les\r\nTravailleurs_)--\r\n\r\n     \"Ses ailes de géant l'empêchent de _marcher_,\"\r\n\r\nthough the sense is not absolutely coextensive.\r\n\r\n[123] If I have spoken above \"so that the Congregation be thereby\r\noffended,\" let me point out that there is no other way of dealing with\r\nthe subject critically, except perhaps by leaving a page blank save for\r\nsuch words, in the middle of it, as \"Victor Hugo is Victor Hugo; and he\r\nis for each reader to take or to leave.\" _He_ would, I think, have\r\nrather liked this; _I_ should not, as a person, dislike it; but I fear\r\nit might not suit with my duty as a critic and a historian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nBEYLE AND BALZAC\r\n\r\n\r\nThere may possibly be some readers who might prefer that the two\r\nnovelists whose names head this chapter should be treated each in a\r\nchapter to himself. But after trying several plans (for I can assure\r\nsuch readers that the arrangement of this History has been the reverse\r\nof haphazard) I have thought it best to yoke them. That they have more\r\nin common with each other, not merely than either has with Hugo or\r\nDumas, or even George Sand, but than either of these three has with the\r\nothers, few will deny. And as a _practising_ novelist Beyle has hardly\r\nsubstance enough to stand by himself, though as an influence--for a time\r\nand that no short one and still existing--scarcely any writer in our\r\nwhole list has been more efficacious. It is not my purpose, nor, I\r\nthink, my duty, to say much about their relations to each other; indeed\r\nBeyle delayed his novel-work so long, and Balzac codified his own so\r\ncarefully and so early, that the examination of the question would need\r\nto be meticulous, and might even be a little futile in a general\r\nhistory, though it is an interesting subject for a monograph. It is\r\nenough to say that, _generally_, both belong to the analytical rather\r\nthan to the synthetical branch of novel-writing, and may almost be said\r\nbetween them to have introduced the analytical romance; that they\r\ncompose their palettes of sombre and neutral rather than of brilliant\r\ncolours; that actual \"story interest\" is not what they, as a rule,[124]\r\naim at. Finally--though this may be a proposition likely to be disputed\r\nwith some heat in one case if not in both--their conception of humanity\r\nhas a certain \"other-worldliness\" about it, though it is as far as\r\npossible from being what is usually understood by the adjective\r\n\"unworldly\" and though the forms thereof in the two only partially\r\ncoincide.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beyle--his peculiarity.]\r\n\r\nOf the books of Henri Beyle, otherwise Stendhal,[125] to say that they\r\nare not like anything else will only seem banal to those who bring the\r\nbanality with them. To annoy these further by opposing pedantry to\r\nbanality, one might say that the aseity is quintessential. There\r\nnever--to be a man of great power, almost genius, a commanding\r\ninfluence, and something like the founder of a characteristic school of\r\nliterature--was such a _habitans in sicco_ as Beyle; indeed his\r\nsubstance and his atmosphere are not so much dry as _desiccated_. The\r\ndryness is not like that which was attributed in the last volume to\r\nHamilton, which is the dryness of wine: it is almost the dryness of\r\nashes. By bringing some humour of your own[126] you may confection a\r\nsort of grim comedy out of parts of his work, but that is all. At the\r\nsame time, he has an astonishing command of such reality, and even\r\nvitality, as will (one cannot say survive but) remain over the process\r\nof desiccation.\r\n\r\nThat Beyle was not such a passionless person as he gave himself out to\r\nbe in his published works was of course always suspected, and more than\r\nsuspected, by readers with any knowledge of human nature. It was finally\r\nproved by the autobiographic _Vie de Henri Brulard_, and the other\r\nremains which were at last given to the world, nearly half a century\r\nafter the author's death, by M. Casimir Stryienski. But the great part\r\nwhich he played in producing a new kind of novel is properly concerned\r\nwith the earlier and larger division of the work, though the posthumous\r\nstuff reinforces this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Armance._]\r\n\r\nSome one, I believe, has said--many people may have said--that you never\r\nget a much truer notion, though you may afterwards get a clearer and\r\nfuller, of a writer than from his earliest work.[127] _Armance_, Beyle's\r\nfirst published novel,[128] though by no means the one which has\r\nreceived most attention, is certainly illuminating. Or rather, perhaps\r\none should say that it poses the puzzle which Beyle himself put briefly\r\nin the words quoted by his editor and biographer: \"Qu'ai-j'été? que\r\nsuis-je? En vérité je serais bien embarrassé de le dire.\" To tell equal\r\ntruth, it is but a dull book in itself, surcharged with a vague\r\npolitical spite, containing no personage whom we are permitted to like\r\n(it would be quite possible to like Armance de Zohiloff if we were only\r\ntold less _about_ her and allowed to see and hear more _of_ her), and\r\npossessing, for a hero, one of the most obnoxious and foolish prigs that\r\nI can remember in any novel. Octave de Malivert unites varieties of\r\ndetestableness in a way which might be interesting if (to speak with\r\nonly apparent flippancy) it were made so. He is commonplace in his\r\nadoration of his mother and his neglect (though his historian calls it\r\n\"respect\") of his father; he is constantly a prig, as when he is shocked\r\nat people for paying more attention to him when they hear that his\r\nparents are going to be indemnified to a large extent for the thefts of\r\ntheir property at the Revolution; he is such a sneak and such a snob\r\nthat he is always eavesdropping to hear what people say about him; such\r\na bounder that he disturbs his neighbours by talking loud at the play;\r\nsuch a brute that he deliberately kills a rather harmless coxcomb of a\r\nmarquis who rebukes him for making this _tapage_; and such a still\r\ngreater brute (for in the duel he had himself been wounded) that he\r\nthrows out of the window an unfortunate lackey who gets in his way at a\r\nparty where Octave has, as usual, lost his temper. Finally, he is a\r\ncombination of prig, sneak, cad, brute, and fool when (having picked up\r\nand read a forged letter which is not addressed to him, though it has\r\nbeen put by enemies in his way) he believes, without any enquiry, that\r\nhis unlucky cousin Armance, to whom he is at last engaged, is deceiving\r\nhim, but marries her all the same, lives with her (she loves him\r\nfrantically) for a few days, and then, pretending to go to the succour\r\nof the Greeks, poisons himself on board ship--rather more, as far as one\r\ncan make out, in order to annoy her than for any other reason. That\r\nthere are the elements, and something more than the elements, of a\r\npowerful story in this is of course evident; there nearly always are\r\nsuch elements in Beyle, and that is why he has his place here. But, as\r\nhas been said, the story is almost as dull as it is disagreeable.\r\nUnluckily, too, it is, like most of his other books, pervaded by an\r\nunpleasant suggestion that the disagreeableness is intimately connected\r\nwith the author's own nature. As with Julien Sorel (_v. inf._) so with\r\nOctave de Malivert, one feels that, though Beyle would never have\r\nbehaved exactly like his book-child, that book-child has a great deal\r\ntoo much of the uncanny and semi-diabolical doubles of some occult\r\nstories in it--is, in fact, an incarnation of the bad Beyle, the seamy\r\nside of Beyle, the creature that Beyle might have been but for the grace\r\nof that God in whom he did not believe. Which things, however one may\r\nhave schooled oneself not to let book and author interfere with each\r\nother, are not comfortable.\r\n\r\nIt ought, however, to be said that _Armance_ is an early and remarkable\r\nRomantic experiment in several ways, not least in the foreign mottoes,\r\nEnglish, Portuguese, Spanish, and German, which are prefixed to the\r\nchapters. Unluckily some of them[129] are obviously retranslated from\r\nFrench versions unverified by the originals, and once there is a most\r\ncurious blunder. Pope's description of Belinda's neck and cross, not\r\nquite in the original words but otherwise exact, is attributed\r\nto--Schiller!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Chartreuse de Parme._]\r\n\r\nI have read, I believe, as much criticism as most men, possibly, indeed,\r\na little more than most, and I ought long ago to have been beyond the\r\nreach of shocking, startling, or any other movement of surprise at any\r\ncritical utterance whatsoever. But I own that an access of _fou rire_\r\nonce came upon me when I was told in a printed page that _La Chartreuse\r\nde Parme_ was a \"very lively and very amusing book.\" A book of great and\r\npeculiar power it most undoubtedly is, a book standing out in the\r\nformidable genealogy of \"psychological\" novels as (_salva reverentia_)\r\ncertain names stand out from the others in the greater list that opens\r\nthe first chapter of St. Matthew. But \"lively\"? and \"amusing\"? Wondrous\r\nhot indeed is this snow, and more lustrous than any ebony are the\r\nclerestories towards the south-north of this structure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Waterloo episode.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The subject and general colour.]\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there rests on the whole book that oppression of _récit_\r\nwhich has been not unfrequently dwelt upon in the last volume, and\r\nsometimes this. Of the 440 pages, tightly printed, of the usual reprint,\r\nI should say that two-thirds at least are solid, or merely broken by one\r\nor two paragraphs, which are seldom conversational. This, it may be\r\nsaid, is a purely mechanical objection. But it is not so. Although the\r\naction is laid in the time contemporary with the writer and writing,\r\nfrom the fall of Napoleon onwards, and in the country (Italy) that he\r\nknew best, the whole cast and scheme are historical, the method is that\r\nof a lecturer at a panorama, who describes and points while the panorama\r\nitself passes a long way off behind a screen of clear but thick glass.\r\nIn two or perhaps three mostly minute parts or scenes this description\r\nmay seem unjust. One, the first, the longest, and the best, is perhaps\r\nalso the best-known of all Beyle's work: it is the sketch of the\r\n_débâcle_ after Waterloo. (It is not wonderful that Beyle should know\r\nsomething about retreats, for, though he was not at Waterloo, he had\r\ncome through the Moscow trial.) This is a really marvellous thing and\r\nintensely interesting, though, as is almost always the case with the\r\nauthor, strangely unexciting. The interest is purely intellectual, and\r\nis actually increased by comparison with Hugo's imaginative account of\r\nthe battle itself; but you do not care the snap of a finger whether the\r\nhero, Fabrice, gets off or not. Another patch later, where this same\r\nFabrice is attacked by, and after a rough-and-tumble struggle kills, his\r\nsaltimbanque rival in the affections of a low-class actress, and then\r\nhas a series of escapes from the Austrian police on the banks of the Po,\r\nhas a little more of the exciting about it. So perhaps for some--I am\r\nnot sure that it has for me--may have the final, or provisionally final,\r\nescape from the Farnese Tower. And there is, even outside of these\r\npassages, a good deal of scattered incident.\r\n\r\nBut these interesting plums, such as even they are, are stuck in an\r\nenormous pudding of presentation of the intrigues and vicissitudes of a\r\npetty Italian court,[130] in which, and in the persons who take part in\r\nthem, I at least find it difficult to take the very slightest interest.\r\nFabrice del Dongo himself,[131] with whom every woman falls in love, and\r\nwho candidly confesses that he does not know whether he has ever been\r\nreally in love with any woman--though there is one possible exception\r\nprecedent, his aunt, the Duchess of Sanseverina, and one subsequent,\r\nClélia Conti, who saves him from prison, as above--is depicted with\r\nextraordinary science of human nature. But it is a science which, once\r\nmore, excludes passion, humour, gusto--all the _fluids_ of real or\r\nfictitious life. Fabrice is like (only \"much more also\") the simulacra\r\nof humanity that were popular in music-halls a few years ago. He walks,\r\ntalks, fights, eats, drinks, _thinks_ even, and makes love if he does\r\nnot feel it, exactly like a human being. Except the \"fluids\" just\r\nmentioned, it is impossible to mention anything human that he lacks. But\r\nhe lacks these, and by not having them lacks everything that moves the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nAnd so it is more or less with all of them: with the Duchess and Clélia\r\nleast perhaps, but even with them to some extent; with the Duchess's\r\nfirst _cicisbeo_ and then husband, Count Mosca, prime minister of the\r\nDuke of Parma; with his master, the feebly cruel and feebly tyrannical\r\nRanuce-Ernest IV.; with the opposition intriguers at court; with the\r\nArchbishop, to whom Fabrice is made, by the influence of Count and\r\nDuchess, coadjutor and actual successor; with Clélia's father and her\r\nvery much belated husband--with all of them in short. You cannot say\r\nthey are \"out\"; on the contrary they do and say exactly what in the\r\ncircumstances they would do and say. Their creator's remarks about them\r\nare sometimes of a marvellous subtlety, expressed in a laconism which\r\nseems to regard Marivaudage or Meredithese with an aristocratic disdain.\r\nBut at other times this laconic letter literally killeth. Perhaps two\r\nexamples of the two effects should be given:\r\n\r\n     (_Fabrice has found favour in the eyes and arms of the\r\n     actress Marietta_)\r\n\r\n     The love of this pretty Marietta gave Fabrice all the charms\r\n     of the sweetest friendship. _And this made him think of the\r\n     happiness of the same kind which he might have found with\r\n     the Duchess herself._\r\n\r\nIf this is not \"piercing to the accepted hells beneath\" with a\r\ndiamond-pointed plunger, I know not what is.\r\n\r\nBut much later, quite towards the end of the book, the author has to\r\ntell how Fabrice again and Clélia \"forgot all but love\" in one of their\r\nstolen meetings to arrange his escape.\r\n\r\n     (_He has, by the way, told a lie to make her think he is\r\n     poisoned_)\r\n\r\n     She was so beautiful--half-dressed and in a state of extreme\r\n     passion as she was--that Fabrice could not resist an almost\r\n     involuntary movement. No resistance was opposed.[132]\r\n\r\nNow I am not (see _Addenda and Corrigenda_ of the last volume) avid of\r\nexpatiations of the Laclosian kind. But this is really a little too much\r\nof the \"Spanish-fleet-taken-and-burnt-as-per-margin\" order.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _L'Abbesse de Castro_, etc.]\r\n\r\nMuch the same characteristics, but necessarily on a small scale, appear\r\nin the short stories usually found under the title of the first and\r\nlongest of them, _L'Abbesse de Castro_. Two of these, _Mina de Wangel_\r\nand _Le Philtre_, are _historiettes_ of the passion which is absent from\r\n_La Chartreuse de Parme_; but each is tainted with the _macabre_ touch\r\nwhich Beyle affected or which (for that word is hardly fair) was natural\r\nto him. In one a German girl of high rank and great wealth falls in love\r\nwith a married man, separates him from his wife by a gross deception,\r\nlives with him for a time; and when he leaves her on finding out the\r\nfraud, blows her brains out. In the other a Spanish lady, seduced and\r\nmaltreated by a creole circus-rider of the worst character, declares to\r\na more honourable lover her incurable passion for the scoundrel and\r\ntakes the veil. The rest are stories of the Italian Renaissance, grimy\r\nand gory as usual. Vittoria Accoramboni herself figures, but there is no\r\nevidence that Beyle (although he had some knowledge of English\r\nliterature[133]) knew at the time our glorious \"White Devil,\" and his\r\nstory dwells little on her faults and much on the punishment of her\r\nmurderers. _L'Abbesse de Castro_ itself, _La Duchesse de Palliano_, _San\r\nFrancesco à Ripa_, _Vanina Vanini_ are all of the same type and all full\r\nof the gloomier items seen by the Dreamer of Fair Women--\r\n\r\n    Scaffolds, still sheets of water, divers woes,\r\n    Ranges of glimmering vaults with iron grates,\r\n\r\nand blood everywhere. And these unmerry tales are always recounted _ab\r\nextra_; in fact, many of them are real or pretended abstracts from\r\nchronicles of the very kind which furnished Browning with the matter of\r\n_The Ring and the Book_. It is, however, more apt and more curious to\r\ncompare them with the scenes of Gerard's experiences with the princess\r\nin _The Cloister and the Hearth_, as instances of different handling of\r\nthe same matter by two novelists of talent almost, if not quite,\r\nreaching genius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Rouge et le Noir._]\r\n\r\nThis singular aloofness, this separation of subject and spectator by a\r\nvast and impenetrable though translucent wall, as in a museum or a\r\n_morgue_, is characteristic of all Beyle's books more or less. In fact,\r\nhe somewhere confesses--the confession having, as always in persons of\r\nanything like his stamp, the nature of a boast--that he cannot write\r\notherwise than in _récit_, that the broken conversational or dramatic\r\nmethod is impossible to him. But an almost startling change--or perhaps\r\nit would be more accurate to say reinforcement--of this method appears\r\nin what seems to me by far the most remarkable and epoch-making of his\r\nbooks, _Le Rouge et le Noir_. That there is a strong autobiographic\r\nelement in this, though vigorously and almost violently \"transposed,\"\r\nmust have been evident to any critical reader long ago. It became not\r\nmerely evident but _evidenced_ by the fresh matter published thirty\r\nyears since.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beyle's masterpiece, and why.]\r\n\r\nThe book is a long one; it drags in parts; and, long as it is, there is\r\nstuff in it for a much longer--indeed preferably for two or three. It is\r\nnot only a _roman passionnel_, as Beyle understood passion, not only a\r\ncollection of Parisian and Provincial scenes, but a romance of secret\r\ndiplomacy, and one of Seminarist life, with constant side-excursions of\r\nVoltairianism, in religion, of the revolutionary element in politics\r\nwhich Voltaire did not ostensibly favour, however much he may have been\r\nresponsible for it, of private cynicism, and above all and most\r\nconsistently of all, of that psychological realism, which is perhaps a\r\nmore different thing from psychological reality than our clever ones for\r\ntwo generations have been willing to admit, or, perhaps, able to\r\nperceive.\r\n\r\nThat--to adopt a division which foolish folk have sneered at directly\r\nand indirectly, but which is valuable and almost necessary in the case\r\nof second-class literature--it is rather an unpleasant than a pleasant\r\nbook, must be pretty well apparent from what has been already said of\r\nits author and itself. That it is a powerful one follows almost in the\r\nsame way. But what has to be said, for the first, if not also the last,\r\ntime in reference to Beyle's fiction, is that it is interesting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Julien Sorel and Mathilde de la Mole.]\r\n\r\nThe interest depends almost entirely--I really do not think it would be\r\nrash to say entirely--upon the hero and one of the heroines. The other\r\npersonages are dramatically and psychologically competent, but Beyle\r\nhas--perhaps save in one or two cases intentionally--made them something\r\nof _comparses_ or \"supers.\" There may be two opinions about the other\r\nheroine, Madame de Rênal, Julien Sorel's first and last love, his victim\r\nin two senses and directly the cause of his death, though he was not\r\ndirectly the cause of hers. She seems to me merely what the French call\r\na _femmelette_, feebly amorous, feebly fond of her children, feebly\r\nestranged from and unfaithful to her husband, feebly though fatally\r\njealous of and a traitress to her lover--feebly everything. Shakespeare\r\nor Miss Austen[134] could have made such a character interesting, Beyle\r\ncould not. Nor do the other \"seconds\"--Julien's brutal peasant father\r\nand brothers, the notables of Verrières, the husband, M. de Rênal\r\n(himself a _gentillâtre_, as well as a man of business, a bully, and a\r\nblockhead), and the hero's just failure of a father-in-law, the Marquis\r\nde la Mole--seem to me to come up to the mark. But, after all, they\r\nfurnish forth the action, and are necessary in their various ways to set\r\nforth the character of that hero and his second love, almost in the\r\nmediaeval sense his wife and his widow, Mathilde de la Mole, heiress,\r\ngreat lady, _fille folle de son corps_, and, in a kind of way, Queen\r\nWhims.\r\n\r\nJulien Sorel, allowance being made for his date, is one of the most\r\nremarkable heroes of fiction. He is physically handsome, in fact\r\nbeautiful,[135] intellectually very clever, and possessed, in especial,\r\nof a marvellous memory; also, though not well educated early, capable of\r\nlearning anything in a very short time--but presented in these\r\nfavourable lights without any exaggeration. A distinguished Lord Justice\r\nwas said by his admirers, at the beginning of his manhood, to have\r\nobtained more marks in examinations than any youthful person in the\r\nUnited Kingdom: and Julien, with equal opportunities, would probably\r\nhave done the same in France. Morally, in no limited sense of the word,\r\nhe does not possess a single good quality, and does possess most bad\r\nones, with the possible exceptions of gluttony and avarice. That, being\r\nin each case a family tutor or _employé_ under trust, he seduces the\r\nwife of his first employer and the daughter of the second, cannot, in\r\nthe peculiar circumstances, be said to count. This is, as it were, the\r\nstarting-point, the necessary handicap, in the competition of this kind\r\nof novel. It is as he is, and in reference to what he does, after this\r\nis put aside, that he has to be considered. He is not a stage villain,\r\nthough he has the peculiar, and in the circumstances important, if\r\nhighly-to-be-deprecated habit of carrying pocket-pistols. He is not a\r\nByronic hero with a terrible but misty past. He is not like Valmont of\r\nthe _Liaisons Dangereuses_,[136] a professional and passionless\r\nlady-killer. He is not a swindler nor (though he sometimes comes near to\r\nthis also) a conspirator like Count Fosco of _The Woman in White_. One\r\nmight make a long list of such negatives if it were worth while. He is\r\nonly an utterly selfish, arrogant, envious, and generally\r\nbad-blooded[137] young man, whom circumstances partly, and his own\r\nmisdeeds helping them, first corrupt and then destroy. You never\r\nsympathise with him for one moment, except in a peculiar fashion to be\r\nnoted presently; but at the same time he neither quite bores you nor\r\nquite disgusts you. _Homo est_, and it is Beyle's having made him so\r\nthat makes Beyle a sort of genius and much more than a sort of novelist.\r\n\r\nBut I am not certain that Mathilde is not even a greater creation,\r\nthough again it is, except quite towards the end, equally impossible to\r\nlike her. _Femina est_, though sometimes _furens_, oftener still\r\n_furiosa_ (in a still wider sense than that in which Mr. Norris has[138]\r\ningeniously \"feminated\" Orlando _Furioso_), and, in part of her conduct\r\nalready alluded to, as destitute of any morality as Julien himself.\r\nAlthough there could hardly be (and no doubt had better not be) many\r\nlike her, she is real and true, and there are not a few redeeming\r\nfeatures in her artistically and even personally. She is, as has been\r\nsaid, both rich and noble, the famous lover of the third Valois\r\nMarguerite being an (I suppose collateral) ancestor of hers.[139] Her\r\nfather is not merely a patrician but a Minister at the close of the\r\nFrench Restoration; she may marry any one she likes; and has, in fact, a\r\ntrain of admirers whom she alternately cajoles and snubs. Julien is\r\ntaken into the household as half private secretary, half librarian; is\r\nespecially favoured by her father, and treated by her brother (one of\r\nBeyle's few thoroughly good fellows) almost on equal terms. But his bad\r\nblood and his want of breeding make him stiff and mysterious, and\r\nMathilde takes a perverse fancy to him, the growth of which is skilfully\r\ndrawn. Although she is nothing so little as a Lélia or an Indiana or a\r\nValentine (_vide_ next chapter), she is idiosyncratically romantic, and\r\nat last it is a case of ladders up to the window, \"the irreparable,\" and\r\nvarious wild performances on her part and her lover's. But this is all\r\ncomparatively banal. Beyle's touch of genius only reappears later. An\r\nextraordinary but (when one comes to think of it) not in the least\r\nunnatural series of \"ups and downs\" follows. Julien's bad blood and\r\nvulgar nature make him presume on the advantage he has obtained;\r\nMathilde's _morgue_ and hot-headedness make her feel degraded by what\r\nshe has given. She neglects him and he becomes quite frantic about\r\n_her_; he takes sudden dudgeon and she becomes frantically desirous of\r\n_him_. This spiritual or emotional man-and-woman-in-the-weather-house\r\nbusiness continues; but at last, with ambages and minor peripeteias\r\nimpossible to abstract, it so comes about that the great and proud\r\nMarquis de La Mole, startlingly but not quite improbably, chooses to\r\nrecognise this traitor and seducer as a possible by-blow of nobility,\r\ngets him a commission, endows him handsomely, and all but gives his\r\nconsent to a marriage.\r\n\r\nThen the final revolution comes. With again extraordinary but, as it is\r\ntold, again not inconceivable audacity, Julien refers for character to\r\nhis first mistress in both senses, Madame de Rênal, and she \"gives him\r\naway.\" The marquis breaks off the treaties, and Julien, leaving his\r\nquarters, journeys down to Verrières and shoots Madame de Rênal (with\r\nthe pocket-pistols) in church. She does not die, and is not even very\r\nseriously wounded; but he is tried, is (according, it would seem, to a\r\nstate of French law, which contrasts most remarkably with one's recent\r\nknowledge of it) condemned, and after a time is executed for a murder\r\nwhich has not been committed. Mathilde (who is to bear him a child and\r\nalways considers herself his wife) and Madame de Rênal both visit him in\r\nprison, the former making immense efforts to save him. But Julien,\r\nconsistently with his character all through, is now rather bored by\r\nMathilde and exceedingly fond of Madame de Rênal, who dies shortly\r\nafter him. What becomes of Mathilde we are not told, except that she\r\ndevotes herself to her paulo-post-future infant. The mere summary may\r\nseem rather preposterous; the book is in a way so. But it is also, in no\r\nordinary sense, once more real and true. It has sometimes been regarded\r\nas a childish, but I believe it to be a true, criterion of novels that\r\nthe reader should feel as if he would like to have had personal dealings\r\nwith the personages. I should very much like to have shot[140] Julien\r\nSorel, though it would have been rather an honour for him. And I should\r\nvery much like to have made Mathilde fall in love with me. As for Madame\r\nde Rênal, she was only good for suckling fools and telling tales out of\r\nschool. But I do not find fault with Beyle for drawing her, and she,\r\ntoo, is very human.\r\n\r\nIn fact the book, pleasant or unpleasant, if we reflect on what the\r\nFrench novel was at the time, deserves a very high place. Compare it\r\nwith others, and nowhere, except in Balzac, will you find anything like\r\nit for firm analysis of character, while I confess that it seems to me\r\nto be more strictly human of this world, and at the same time more\r\noriginal,[141] than a good deal of the _Comédie_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The resuscitated work--_Lamiel_.]\r\n\r\nThe question, \"Would a novelist in altered circumstances have given us\r\nmore or better novels?\" is sometimes treated as _ultra vires_ or _nihil\r\nad rem_ on the critic's part. I myself have been accused rather of\r\nlimiting than of extending the province of the literary critic; yet I\r\nthink this question is, sometimes at least, in place. If so, it can\r\nseldom be more in place than with Beyle, first because of the unusually\r\nmperfect character of his actual published work; and secondly, because\r\nof the still more unusual abundance of half-done work, or of fragments\r\nof self-criticism, which what has been called the \"Beyle resurrection\"\r\nof the close of the last century has furnished. Indeed the unfinished\r\nand scarcely more than half-drafted novel of _Lamiel_ almost by itself\r\nsuggests the question and supplies the answer. That answer--except from\r\nfavourers of the grime-novel which, oddly enough, whether by coincidence\r\nor common causation became so popular at about the time of this\r\n\"resurrection\"--can hardly be favourable. _Lamiel_ is a very grubby\r\nlittle book. The eponymous heroine is adopted as a child by a parish\r\nbeadle and his wife, who do not at all maltreat her, except by bringing\r\nher up in ways of extreme propriety, which she detests, taking delight\r\nin the histories of Mandrin, Cartouche and Co. At early maidenhood she\r\nis pitched upon as _lectrice_, and in a way favourite, by the great lady\r\nof the neighbourhood, the Duchess of Miossens; and in this position\r\nfirst attracts the attention of a peculiarly diabolical little dwarf\r\ndoctor, who, bar the comic[142] element, reminds one rather of Quilp.\r\nHis designs are, however, baulked in a most Beylian manner; for Lamiel\r\n(who, by a pleasing chance, was at first called \"Amiel\"--a delightfully\r\n_other_ Amiel!) coolly bestows some money upon a peasant to \"teach her\r\nwhat love is,\" and literally asks the Gebirian question about the ocean,\r\n\"Is this all?\" after receiving the lesson. Further, in the more and more\r\nunfinished parts of the book, she levants for a time with the young\r\nduke, quits him, becomes a professional hetaera in Paris, but never\r\ntakes any fancy to the business of her avocation till she meets an\r\nall-conquering criminal, Valbayre.[143] The scenario tells us that,\r\nValbayre having been caught by justice, she sets fire to the Palace\r\nthereof, and her own bones are discovered in the ashes.\r\n\r\nThis, though Beyle at least meant to season the misanthropy with irony\r\n(he might be compared with Meredith for some slightly cryptic views of\r\n\"the Comic Spirit\"), is rather poor stuff, and certainly shows no\r\nimprovement or likelihood of improvement on the earlier productions. It\r\nis even somewhat lamentable, not so much for the presence of grime as\r\nbecause of the absence of any other attraction. _Le Rouge et le Noir_ is\r\nnot exactly rose-pink, but it derives hardly any, if any, interest from\r\nits smirches of mud and blood and blackness. In _Lamiel_ there is little\r\nelse. Moreover, that unchallengeable \"possibility of humanity\" which\r\nredeems not merely _Le Rouge et le Noir_ but the less exciting books, is\r\nwanting here. Sansfin, the doctor, is a mere monstrosity in mind as well\r\nas in body, and, except perhaps when she ejaculates (as more briefly\r\nreported above), \"Comment! ce fameux amour, _ce n'est que ça_?\" Lamiel\r\nherself is not made interesting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Nouvelles Inédites_.]\r\n\r\nThe _Vie de Henri Brulard_, of high importance for a History of\r\nNovelists, is in strictness outside the subject of a historian of the\r\nNovel, though it might be adduced to strengthen the remarks made on\r\nRousseau's _Confessions_.[144] And the rest of the \"resurrected\" matter\r\nis also more autobiographical, or at best illustrative of Beyle's\r\nrestless and \"masterless\" habit of pulling his work to pieces--of \"never\r\nbeing able to be ready\" (as a deservedly unpopular language has\r\nit)--than contributory to positive novel-achievement. But the first and\r\nby far the most substantive of the _Nouvelles Inédites_, which his\r\namiable but not very strong-minded literary executor, Colomb, published\r\nsoon after his death, needs a little notice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Chasseur Vert._]\r\n\r\n_Le Chasseur Vert_[145] (which had three other titles, three successive\r\nprefaces, and in its finished, or rather unfinished, form is the salvage\r\nof five folio volumes of MS., the rest being at best sketched and at\r\nworst illegible) contains, in what we have of it, the account of the\r\ntribulations of a young sub-lieutenant of Lancers (with a great deal of\r\nmoney, a cynical but rather agreeable banker-papa, an adoring mother,\r\nand the record of an expulsion from the Polytechnique for supposed\r\nRepublicanism) suddenly pitchforked into garrison, soon after the\r\nRevolution of July, at Nancy. Here, in the early years of the July\r\nmonarchy, the whole of decent society is Legitimist; a very small but\r\nnot easily suppressible minority Republican; while officialdom, civil\r\nand military, forms a peculiar _juste milieu_, supporting itself by\r\nespionage and by what Their Majesties of the present moment, the Trade\r\nUnions, call \"victimisation,\" but in a constant state of alarm for its\r\nposition, and \"looking over its shoulder\" with a sort of threefold\r\nsquint, at the white flag, the eagles--and the guillotine. Nothing\r\nreally happens, but it takes 240 pages to bring us to an actual meeting\r\nbetween Lieutenant Lucien Leeuwen and his previously at distance adored\r\nwidow, the Marquise de Chasteller.\r\n\r\nThe book is not a _very_ good novel, even as a fragment, and probably\r\nnothing would ever have made it so as a whole. But there is good\r\nnovel-stuff in it, and it is important to a student of the novel and\r\nalmost indispensable to a student of this novelist. Of the cynical\r\npapa--who, when his son comes to him in a \"high-falutin\" mood, requests\r\nhim to go to his (the papa's) opera-box, to replace his sire with some\r\nagreeable girl-officials of that same institution, and to spend at least\r\n200 francs on a supper for them at the Rocher--one would gladly see\r\nmore. Of the barrack (or rather _not_-barrack) society at Nancy, the\r\nsight given, though not agreeable, is interesting, and to any one who\r\nknew something of our old army, especially before the abolition of\r\npurchase, very curious. There is no mess-room and apparently no common\r\nlife at all, except on duty and at the \"pension\" hotel-meals, to\r\nwhich,--rather, it would seem, at the arbitrary will of the colonel than\r\nby \"regulation,\"--you have to subscribe, though you may, and indeed\r\nmust, live in lodgings exactly like a _particulier_. Of the\r\nsocial-political life of the place we see rather too much, for Beyle,\r\nnot content with making the politics which he does not like make\r\nthemselves ridiculous--or perhaps not being able to do so--himself tells\r\nus frequently that they _are_ ridiculous, which is not equally\r\neffective. So also, instead of putting severe or \"spiritual\" speeches in\r\nLucien's mouth, he tells us that they _were_ spiritual or severe, an\r\nassurance which, of course, we receive with due politeness, but which\r\ndoes not give us as much personal delectation as might be supplied by\r\nthe other method. No doubt this and other things are almost direct\r\nresults of that preference for _récit_ over semi-dramatic evolution of\r\nthe story by deed and word, which has been noticed. But they are\r\ndamaging results all the same: and, after making the fairest allowance\r\nfor its incomplete condition, the thing may be said to support, even\r\nmore than _Lamiel_ does, the conclusion already based upon the\r\nself-published stories (and most of all upon that best of them, _Le\r\nRouge et le Noir_) that Beyle could never have given us a thoroughly\r\nhit-off novel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beyle's place in the story.]\r\n\r\nStill, there is always something unfair in making use of \"Remains,\" and\r\nfor my part I do not think that, unless they are of extraordinary merit,\r\nthey should ever be published. \"Death _should_ clear all scores\" in this\r\nway as in others. Yet no really critical person will think the worse of\r\nBeyle's published work because of these _anecdota_, though they may, as\r\nactually before us, be taken as throwing some light on what is not so\r\ngood in the _publicata_. There can be no doubt that Beyle occupies a\r\nvery important position in the history of the novel, and not of the\r\nFrench novel only, as the first, or almost the first, analyst of the\r\nugly for fictitious purposes, and as showing singular power in his\r\nanalysis. Unfortunately his synthetic gifts were not equally great. He\r\nhad strange difficulty in making his stories _march_; he only now and\r\nthen got them to _run_; and though the real life of his characters has\r\nbeen acknowledged, it is after all a sort of \"Life-in-Death,\" a new\r\nmanifestation of the evil power of that mysterious entity whom\r\nColeridge, if he did not discover, first named and produced in\r\nquasi-flesh, though he left us without any indication of more than one\r\ntiny and accidental part of her dread kingdom.\r\n\r\nHe has thus the position of _père de famille_, whether (to repeat the\r\nold joke) of a _famille déplorable_ in the moral, not the sentimental,\r\nsense, must, I suppose, be left matter of opinion. The plentiful crop of\r\nmonographs about him since M. Stryienski's Pompeian explorations and\r\npublications is in a manner--if only in a manner--justified by the\r\nnumerous followers--not always or perhaps often conscious followers, and\r\nso even more important--in his footsteps. Nobody can say that the\r\npicaresque novelists, whether in their original country or when the\r\nfashion had spread, were given to _berquinades_ or fairy-tales. Nobody\r\ncan say that the tale-writers who preceded and followed them were\r\napostles of virtue or painters of Golden-Age scenes. But, with some\r\nexceptions (chiefly Italian) among the latter, they did not, unless\r\ntheir aim were definitely tragical--an epithet which one could show, on\r\nirrefragable Aristotelian principles, to be rarely if ever applicable to\r\nBeyle and his school--they did not, as the common phrase goes, \"take a\r\ngloomy view\" only. There were cakes and ale; and the cakes did not\r\nalways give internal pains, nor the ale a bad headache. As even Hazlitt\r\n(who has been selected, not without reason, as in many ways like Beyle)\r\nsaid of himself on his death-bed, rather to some folks' surprise though\r\nnot to mine, most of the characters \"had a happy life,\" though the\r\nhappiness might be chequered: and some of them were \"good.\" It is\r\nscarcely an exaggeration to say that in Beyle's books happiness does not\r\nexist, and virtue has hardly a place. There are some characters who may\r\nbe said to be neutral or \"on the line\"; they may be not definitely\r\nunhappy or definitely bad. But this is about as far as he ever goes in\r\nthat direction. And accordingly he and his followers have the fault of\r\none-sidedness; they may (he did) see life steadily, but they do not see\r\nit whole. There is no need to preach a sermon on the text: in this book\r\nthere is full need to record the fact.[146]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Balzac--conditions of the present dealing.]\r\n\r\nIn dealing with Beyle's greater companion here there are certain\r\nthings--not exactly difficulties, but circumstances conditioning the\r\ntreatment--which should be stated. That it is well to know something\r\nabout your subject has been an accepted doctrine with all save very\r\nyoung persons, idle paradoxers, and (according to Sir Walter Scott) the\r\nScottish Court of Session in former days.[147] That it is also well not\r\nto know too much about it has sometimes been maintained, without any\r\nidleness in either sense of the word; the excess being thought likely to\r\ncause weariness, \"staleness,\" and absence of interest. If this were\r\nnecessarily so, it might be better for the writer once more to leave\r\nthis part of the chapter (since at least the heading of it could not\r\npossibly be omitted in the history) a blank or a constellation of\r\nasterisks in Sternian fashion. For it has fallen to his lot to translate\r\none whole novel of Balzac's,[148] to edit a translation of the entire\r\n_Comédie_,[149] superintending some of the volumes in narrow detail, and\r\nstudying each in short, but (intentionally at least) thorough\r\n_Introductions_, with a very elaborate preface-study of the whole; to\r\nread all Balzac's rather voluminous miscellanea from the early\r\nnovel-attempts to posthumous things, including letters; and, finally, to\r\ndiscuss the subject once more, with the aid or burden of many previous\r\ncommentaries, in a long _Review_ article.[150] Nevertheless, he does not\r\nfeel that any disgust forbids while a clear duty calls: and he hopes to\r\nshow that it is not always necessary to weary of quails as in the\r\nBiblical, partridges as in the old _fabliau_, and pigeons in the Dumas\r\n_fils_ (_v. inf._) version of the Parable of Satiety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Limitations of Subject.]\r\n\r\nIn no case, however, not even in that of Victor Hugo, is the easement\r\ngiven by the general plan of the book, in regard to biographical and\r\nother not strictly literary details, more welcome. We shall say nothing\r\non the point whether the author of the _Comédie Humaine_ should be\r\ncalled M. de Balzac or M. Balzac or M. Balssa; nothing about his family,\r\nhis friends, his enemies, his strangely long-deferred, and, when it\r\ncame, as strangely ill-fated marriage; little, though something\r\nnecessarily, about his tastes, his commercial and other enterprises, and\r\nso forth; and not very much--something here also becoming obligatory--on\r\nhis manner of producing the immense and wonderful work which he has left\r\nus. Those who are curious about such things will find ample satisfaction\r\nin the labours of M. Spoelberch de Lovenjoul, of MM. Christophe and\r\nCerfbeer, and of others.[151] Here he is, for us, Honoré de Balzac,\r\nauthor of the _Juvenilia_ (saved from, as it is understood, a larger\r\nbulk still) in ten volumes; of the mighty \"Comedy\" itself, and, more\r\nincidentally, of the considerable epistolary and miscellaneous\r\nproduction referred to above. The manner in which this enormous output\r\nwas put out has perhaps too much to do with its actual character to be\r\npassed over in total silence. It represents thirty years' working time\r\nalmost entirely spent upon it,[152] the alternatives being the\r\nabove-mentioned commercial speculations (which were almost invariably\r\nunfortunate, and involved him, during the whole of his career, in\r\ncomplicated indebtedness) and a good deal of travel, very frequently\r\nconnected with these speculations. Of the society which formed so large\r\na part of the life of the time and of which he wrote so often, Balzac\r\nsaw little. He worked at enormous stretches, and he rewrote his work, in\r\nMS., in proof and in temporarily final print, with insatiable and\r\nindefatigable industry. To no writer could the commonplace extravagance\r\nabout burning the candle at both ends be applied so truly as to Balzac.\r\nOnly, his candle was shaped like a wheel with no felloes, and he burnt\r\nit at the end of every spoke and at the nave as well. How he managed to\r\nlast, even to fifty, is one of the major curiosities of literary\r\nbiography.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And of Balzac himself.]\r\n\r\nOf the three divisions of this vast but far from chaotic production, the\r\nmiscellaneous, of course, concerns us least. It shows Balzac as a\r\nfailure of a dramatist, a critic of very varying competence,[153] not a\r\nparticularly effective _writer_ merely as such, not possessed of much\r\nlogical power, but having pretty wide interests and abundantly provided\r\nwith what we may call the odd tools of the novelist's workshop. As a\r\ncorrespondent his writing has absolutely none of what may be called the\r\n\"departmental\" interest of great letter-writers--of Madame de Sévigné or\r\nLady Mary, of Horace Walpole or Cowper; its attraction is not epistolary\r\nbut wholly autobiographic. And it is only fair to say that, despite\r\nBalzac's immense and intense self-centredness, it leaves one on the\r\nwhole with a much better opinion of him as a man than might be derived\r\nfrom his books or from the anecdotes about him. To adapt one of the best\r\nknown of these, there was, in fact, nothing real to him but Honoré de\r\nBalzac, Honoré de Balzac's works and schemes, and, in rare cases (of\r\nwhich Madame Hanska was the chief), Honoré de Balzac's loves. These\r\nconstituted his subject, his universe of thought and feeling, of action\r\nand passion. But at the same time he stands apart from all the other\r\ngreat egotists. He differs from those of whom Byron is the chief in that\r\nhe does not introduce himself prominently in his fictitious creations.\r\nHe does not, like those who may take their representative in Goethe,\r\nregard everything merely as it relates to his personality. His chief\r\npeculiarity, his unique literary character, and, it may be added at\r\nonce, his greatness and his weakness, all consist in the fact that he\r\nevolves a new world out of himself. Now and then he may have taken an\r\nactual human model--George Sand, Madame d'Agoult, Madame de Castries,\r\nLiszt, Latouche,[154] Rémusat--as many others as anybody likes. But\r\nalways these had not merely to receive the Balzacian image and\r\nsuperscription, but to be transmuted into creatures of a _Balzacium\r\nSidus_. And it is the humanity of this planet or system, much more than\r\nof our world, whereof his _Comédie_ is the Comedy--a _Comédie\r\nBalzacienne_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Balzac's \"general ideas.\"]\r\n\r\nBut, it has been said, and the saying has been attributed to no less a\r\ncritic than M. Faguet, there are no \"general ideas\" in Balzac.[155] One\r\ncan only reply, \"Heavens! Why should there be?\" The celebrated unreason\r\nof \"going to a gin-palace for a leg of mutton\" (already quoted, and\r\nperhaps to be quoted again) is sound and sensible as compared with\r\nasking general ideas from a novelist. They are not quite absolutely\r\nforbidden to him, though he will have to be very careful lest they get\r\nin his way. But they are most emphatically not his business, except as\r\nvery rare and very doubtful means to a quite different end, means\r\nabsolutely insufficient by themselves and exceedingly difficult to\r\ncombine with the other means which--more or fewer of them--are not only\r\nsufficient but necessary. The \"slice of human life,\" not necessarily,\r\nbut preferably ordinary, presenting probable and interesting\r\ncharacters, connected by sufficient plot, diversified and adorned by\r\ndescriptive and other devices, and abundantly furnished with the\r\nconversation of men and women of this world, the whole forming such a\r\nwhole as will amuse, thrill, affect, and in other ways, to use the\r\nall-important word once more, _interest_ the reader,--that is what is\r\nwanted. And this definition is as rigid at least as the Aristotelian\r\ndefinition of tragedy and perhaps more exhaustive, as concerns the\r\nnovel, including, with the necessary modifications, the romance--and the\r\nromance, including, with the necessary modifications, the novel. In it\r\n\"general ideas,\" unless a very special and not at all usual meaning is\r\nattached to the term, can have no right of place. They may be brought\r\nin, as almost anything may be brought in if the writer is Samson enough\r\nto bring it. But they cannot be demanded of him as facts, images,\r\nemotions, style, and a very large number of other things can or may be,\r\nnot, of course, all at once, but in larger or smaller selection. General\r\nideas may and perhaps should be demanded from the philosopher, the\r\nhistorian, the political student. From the poet and the novelist they\r\ncannot be. And that they should be so demanded is one of the chief\r\ninstances of what seems to the present writer to be the greatest mistake\r\nof French novel, as of other, criticism--its persistent relapse upon the\r\nrule-system and its refusal to judge by the result.[156]\r\n\r\nIt is all the more unreasonable to demand general _ideas_ from Balzac\r\nhimself, because he is so liberal of general _imagery_, and what is\r\nmore, general _prosopopoeia_. Be the Balzacian world real, as some\r\nwould have it to be, or be it removed from our mundane reality by the\r\nsubtle \"other-planetary\" influence which is apparent to others, its\r\ncomplexity, its fullness, its variety, its busy and by no means\r\nunsystematic life and motion, cannot be denied. Why on earth cannot\r\npeople be content with asking Platonism from Plato and Balzacity from\r\nBalzac? At any rate, it is Balzacity which will be the subject of the\r\nfollowing pages, and if anybody wants anything else let him go\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abstinence from abstract.]\r\n\r\nThere is hardly likely to be much grumbling at the absence of such\r\ndetailed abstract or survey of individual books as has been given in\r\ncases of what may seem to be much less importance. To begin with, such a\r\nsurvey as is possible[157] exists already from these hands in the\r\nIntroductions to the translated edition above referred to, and to\r\nparaphrase or refashion it here would probably occupy a hundred pages,\r\nif not more. Nor would the plan, elsewhere adopted, of analysing afresh\r\none, or two, or more examples, as representative, be satisfactory.\r\nAlthough Balzac is in a sense one of the most intensely individual of\r\nall novelists, his individuality, as in a very few others of the\r\ngreatest cases, cannot be elicited from particular works. Just as\r\n_Hamlet_ will give you no idea of the probable treatment of _As You Like\r\nIt_, so _Eugénie Grandet_ contains no key to _La Cousine Bette_. Even\r\nthe groups into which he himself rather empirically, if not quite\r\narbitrarily, separated the _Comédie_, though they lend themselves a\r\nlittle more to specification, do not yield very much to the classifier.\r\nThe _Comédie_, once more, is a world--a world open to the reader, \"all\r\nbefore him.\" Chronological order may tell him a little about Balzac, but\r\nit will not tell him very much about Balzac's work that he cannot gain\r\nfrom the individual books, except in the very earliest stages. There is\r\nno doubt that the _Oeuvres de Jeunesse_, if not very delightful to the\r\nreader (I have myself read them not without pleasure), are very\r\ninstructive; the instruction increases, while the pleasure is actually\r\nmultiplied, when you come to _Les Chouans_ and the _Peau de Chagrin_.\r\nBut it is, after a fashion, only beyond these that the true Balzac\r\nbegins, and the beginning is, to a large extent, a reaction from\r\nprevious work in consequence of a discovery that the genius, without\r\nwhich he had acknowledged that it was all up with him,[158] did not lie\r\nthat way, and that he had no hope of finding it there. Not that there is\r\nno genius in the two books mentioned; on the contrary, it is there first\r\nto be found, and in _La Peau_ is of the first order. But their ways are\r\nnot the ways in which he was to find it--and himself--more specially.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Oeuvres de Jeunesse_.]\r\n\r\nAs to _Argow le Pirate_[159] and _Jane la Pâle_ (I have never ceased\r\nlamenting that he did not keep the earlier title, _Wann-Chlore_) and the\r\nrest, they have interest of various kinds. Some of it has been glanced\r\nat already--you cannot fully appreciate Balzac without them. But there\r\nis another kind of interest, perhaps not of very general appeal, but not\r\nto be neglected by the historian. They are almost the only accessible\r\nbody, except Pigault-Lebrun's latest and Paul de Kock's earliest, of the\r\npopular fiction _before_ 1830, of the stuff of which, as previously\r\nmentioned, Ducray-Duminil, the lesser Ducange, and many others are\r\nrepresentatives, but representatives difficult to get at. This class of\r\nfiction, which arose in all parts of Europe during the last years of the\r\neighteenth century and the earlier of the nineteenth, has very similar\r\ncharacteristics, though the examples differ very slightly in different\r\ncountries. What are known with us as the Terror Novel, the Minerva\r\nPress, the Silver Fork school, etc. etc., all have their part in it, and\r\neven higher influences, such as Scott's, are not wanting. _Han\r\nd'Islande_ and _Bug-Jargal_ themselves belong to some extent to the\r\nclass, and I am far from certain that the former is at all better than\r\nsome of these _juvenilia_ of Balzac's. But as a whole they are of course\r\nlittle more than curiosities.\r\n\r\nWhether these curiosities are more widely known than they were some\r\nfive-and-twenty, or thirty, years ago, when Mr. Louis Stevenson was the\r\nonly friend of mine who had read them, and when even special writers on\r\nBalzac sometimes unblushingly confessed that they had not, I cannot say.\r\nAlthough printed in the little fifty-five-volume[160] edition which for\r\nso many years represented Balzac, they were excluded, as noted above,\r\nfrom the statelier \"Définitive,\" and so may have once more \"gone into\r\nabscondence.\" I do not want to read them again, but I no more repent the\r\ntime once spent on them than I did earlier. In fact I really do not\r\nthink any one ought to talk about Balzac who has not at least gained\r\nsome knowledge of them, for many of their defects remained with him when\r\nhe got rid of the others. These defects are numerous enough and serious\r\nenough. The books are nothing if not uncritical, generally extravagant,\r\nand sometimes (especially in _Jean Louis_) appallingly dull. Scarf-pins,\r\nmade of poisoned fish-bones (_Argow le Pirate_), extinction of virgins\r\nunder copper bells (_Le Centénaire_), attempts at fairy-tales (_La\r\nDernière Fée_) jostle each other. The weaker historical kind figures\r\nlargely in _L'Excommunié_ (one of the least bad), _L'Israëlite_,\r\n_L'Héritière de Birague_, _Dom Gigadas_. There is a _Vicaire des\r\nArdennes_ (remarkably different from him of Wakefield), which is a kind\r\nof introduction to _Argow le Pirate_, and which, again, is not the\r\nworst. When I formerly wrote about these curious productions, after\r\nreading them, I had not read Pigault-Lebrun, and therefore did not\r\nperceive, what I now see to be an undoubted fact, that Balzac was,\r\nsometimes at least, trying to follow in Pigault's popular footsteps. But\r\nhe had not that writer's varied knowledge of actual life or his power of\r\ntelling a story, and though he for the most part avoided Pigault's\r\n_grossièreté_, the chaotic plots, the slovenly writing, and other\r\ndefects of his model abode with him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Les Chouans._]\r\n\r\nThere are not many more surprising things, especially _in pari materia_,\r\nto be found in literary history than the sun-burst of _Les Chouans_\r\nafter this darkness-that-can-be-felt of the early melodramas. Not that\r\n_Les Chouans_ is by any means a perfect novel, or even a great one. Its\r\nnarrative drags, in some cases, almost intolerably; the grasp of\r\ncharacter, though visible, is inchoate; the plot is rather a polyptych\r\nof separate scenes than a connected action; you see at once that the\r\nauthor has changed his model to Sir Walter and think how much better Sir\r\nWalter would have done the thing. But there is a strange air of \"coming\r\nalive\" in some of the scenes, though they are too much separated, as in\r\nthe case of the finale and of the execution of the rather hardly used\r\ntraitor earlier. These possess a character of thrill which may be looked\r\nfor in vain through all the ten volumes of the _Oeuvres de Jeunesse_.\r\nMontauran _is_ a hero in more than one sense, and Mlle. de Verneuil is\r\nstill more a heroine. Had Balzac worked her out as he worked out others,\r\nwho did not deserve it so well, later, she might have been one of the\r\ngreat characters in fiction. Even as it is, the \"jour sans lendemain,\"\r\nwhich in one sense unites, and in another parts, her and her lover for\r\never, is one of the most really passionate things that the French novel,\r\nin its revival, had yet seen. Besides this, there is a sort of extrinsic\r\nappeal in the book, giving that curious atmosphere referred to already,\r\nand recalling the old prints of the earth yawning in patches and animals\r\nrearing themselves from it at the Creation. The names and personages of\r\nHulot and Corentin were to be well known later to readers of the \"fifty\r\nvolumes,\" and even the ruffianly patriot[161] Marche-à-Terre had his\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Peau de Chagrin._]\r\n\r\nThe second[162] blast of the horn with which Balzac challenged admission\r\nto the Inner Sanctuaries or strongholds of the novel, _La Peau de\r\nChagrin_, had that character of _difference_ which one notices not\r\nseldom in the first worthy works of great men of letters--the absence of\r\nthe mould and the rut. _Les Chouans_ was a Waverley novel Gallicised and\r\nBalzacified; _La Peau de Chagrin_ is a cross between the supernatural\r\nromance and the novel of psychology. It is one of the greatest of\r\nBalzac's books. The idea of the skin--a new \"wishing\" talisman, which\r\nshrinks with every exercise of the power it gives, and so threatens\r\nextinction at once of wishing and living--is of course not wholly novel,\r\nthough refreshed in detail. But then nothing is wholly novel, and if\r\nanything could be it would probably be worthless. The endless changes of\r\nthe eternal substance make the law, the curse, and the blessing of life.\r\nIn the working out of his theme it may possibly be objected that Balzac\r\nhas not _interested_ the reader quite enough in his personages--that he\r\nseems in a way to be thinking more of the play than of the actors or the\r\naudience. His \"orgie\" is certainly not much of a success; few orgies in\r\nprint are, except when they are burlesqued. But, on the other hand, the\r\ncuriosity-shop is splendid. Yet it is not on the details of the book,\r\nimportant as these have been allowed to be throughout Balzac, that\r\nattention should be mainly concentrated. The point of it is the way in\r\nwhich the necessary atmosphere of bad dream is kept up throughout, yet\r\nwith an appropriate contrast of comparatively ordinary life. A competent\r\ncritic who read _Les Chouans_, knowing nothing about its author or his\r\nwork, should have said, \"Here is more than a promising craftsman\";\r\nreading _La Peau de Chagrin_ in the same conditions he should have said,\r\n\"Here is a great, though by no means a faultless, artist.\" One who read\r\nboth ought to have had no doubt as to the coming of something and\r\nsomebody extraordinary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The short stories.]\r\n\r\nThenceforward Balzac, though hardly ever faultless except in short\r\nstories, was almost always great, and showed what may be called a\r\ndiffused greatness, to which there are few parallels in the history of\r\nthe novel. Some of the tales are simply wonderful. I cannot think of\r\nany one else, even Mérimée, who could have done _La Grande\r\nBretèche_--the story of a lover who, rather than betray his mistress,\r\nallows himself to suffer, without a word, the fate of a nun who has\r\nbroken her vows--as Balzac has done it. _La Recherche de l'Absolu_ is\r\none, and _Le Chef-d'oeuvre Inconnu_ is another, of the greatest known\r\nmasterpieces in the world of their kind. _La Fille aux Yeux d'Or_ and\r\n_Une Passion dans le Désert_ have not the least need of their\r\n\"indexable\" qualities to validate them. In the most opposite styles\r\n_Jésus Christ en Flandre_ and _La Messe de l'Athée_ have their warmest\r\nadmirers. In fact it is scarcely too much to say that, in the whole list\r\nof nearer two than one score--as they were published in the old\r\ncollection from _Le Bal de Sceaux_ to _Maître Cornélius_--scarcely any\r\nare bad or insignificant, few mediocre, and not a few equal, or hardly\r\ninferior, to those specially pointed out just now. As so often\r\nhappens, the short story estopped Balzac from some of his usual\r\ndelinquencies--over-detail, lingering treatment, etc.,--and encouraged\r\nhis virtues--intensity, grandeur, and idiosyncratic tone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Contes Drolatiques_.]\r\n\r\nOf his one considerable collection of such stories--the _Contes\r\nDrolatiques_--it is not possible to speak quite so favourably as a\r\nwhole; yet the reduction of favour need not be much. Of its greatest\r\nthing, _La Succube_, there have hardly been two opinions among competent\r\nand unprejudiced judges. \"Pity and terror\" are there well justified of\r\ntheir manipulator. The sham Old French, if not absolutely \"according to\r\nCocker\" (or such substitute for Cocker as may be made and provided by\r\nscholarly authority), is very much more effective than most such things.\r\nNot a few of the stories are good and amusing in themselves, though of\r\ncourse the votaries of prunes and prism should keep clear of them. The\r\nbook has perhaps only one serious fault, that of the inevitable and no\r\ndoubt invited suggestion of, and comparison with, Rabelais. In some\r\npoints this will hold not so badly, for Balzac had narrative power of\r\nthe first order when he gave it scope; the deficiencies of mere style\r\nwhich sometimes affect his modern French do not appear so much in this\r\n_pastiche_, and he could make broad jokes well enough. But--and this\r\n\"but\" is rather a terrible one--the saving and crowning grace of\r\nPantagruelist humour is not in him, except now and then in its grimmer\r\nand less catholic variety or manifestation. And this absence haunts one\r\nin these _Contes Drolatiques_, though it is to some extent compensated\r\nby the presence of a \"sentiment\" rare elsewhere in Balzac.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Notes on select larger books: _Eugénie Grandet_.]\r\n\r\nTurning to the longer books, the old double difficulty of selection and\r\nomission comes on one in full force. There are, I suppose, few\r\nBalzacians who have not special favourites, but probably _Eugénie\r\nGrandet_, _Le Père Goriot_, and the two divisions of _Les Parents\r\nPauvres_ would unite most suffrages. If I myself--who am not exactly a\r\nBalzacian, though few can admire him more, and not very many, I think,\r\nhave had occasion for knowing his work better--put _Eugénie Grandet_ at\r\nthe head of all the \"scenes\" of ordinary life, it is most certainly not\r\nbecause of its inoffensiveness. It _is_ perhaps partly because, in spite\r\nof that inoffensiveness, it fixes on one a grasp superior to anything of\r\nBeyle's and equal to anything of Flaubert's or Maupassant's. But the\r\nreal cause of admiration is the nature of the grasp itself. Here, and\r\nperhaps here only--certainly here in transcendence--Balzac grapples\r\nwith, and vanquishes, the bare, stern, unadorned, unbaited, ironic facts\r\nof life. It is not an intensely interesting book; it is certainly not a\r\ndelightful one; you do not want to read it very often. Still, when you\r\nhave read it you have come to one of the ultimate things: the\r\n_flammantia moenia_ of the world of fiction forbid any one to go\r\nfurther at this particular point. And when this has been said of a\r\nnovel, all has been said of the quality of the novelist's genius, though\r\nnot of its quantity or variety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Père Goriot_ and _Les Parents Pauvres_.]\r\n\r\nThe other three books selected have greater \"interest\" and, in the case\r\nof the _Parents Pauvres_ at least, much greater variety; but they do not\r\nseem to me to possess equal consummateness. _Le Père Goriot_ is in its\r\nown way as pathetic as _Eugénie Grandet_, and Balzac has saved its\r\npathos from being as irritating as that of the all but idiotic\r\ngrandfather in _The Old Curiosity Shop_. But the situation still has a\r\nshare of that fatal helpless ineffectiveness which Mr. Arnold so justly\r\ndenounced. Of the remaining pair, _La Cousine Bette_ is, I suppose,\r\nagain the favourite; but I am not a backer. I have in other places\r\nexpressed my opinion that if Valérie Marneffe is part-model[163] of\r\nBecky Sharp, which is not, I believe, absolutely certain, the copy\r\nfar--indeed infinitely--exceeds the original, and not least in the facts\r\nthat Becky is attractive while Valérie is not, and that there is any\r\namount of possibility in her. I should not wonder if, some day, a\r\nnovelist took it into his head to show Becky as she would have been if\r\nshe had had those thousands a year for which, with their accompanying\r\nchances of respectability, she so pathetically sighed. Now Valérie is,\r\nand always must have been, a _catin_, and nothing else. Lisbeth, again,\r\nthough I admit her possibility, is not, to me, made quite probable.\r\nHulot, very possible and probable indeed, does not interest or amuse me,\r\nand the angelic Adeline is good but dull. In fact the book, by its very\r\npower, throws into disastrous eminence that absence of _delightfulness_\r\nwhich is Balzac's great want, uncompensated by the presence of the\r\nmagnificence which is his great resource. _La Peau de Chagrin_ and some\r\nof the smaller things have this relief; _La Cousine Bette_ has not. And\r\ntherefore I think that, on the whole, _Le Cousin Pons_ is the better of\r\nthe two, though it may seem to some weaker, further \"below proof.\"\r\nEverything in it is possible and probable, and though the comedy is\r\nrather rueful, it is comedy. It is a play; its companion is rather too\r\nmuch of a sermon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Others--the general \"scenic\" division.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Scènes de la Vie Privée\" (to pass to a rapid general survey of the\r\n\"Acts\" of the Comedy) provide an especially large number of short\r\nstories, almost the only ones of length being _Modeste Mignon_ and\r\n_Béatrix_, a strongly contrasted couple. _Modeste Mignon_ is perhaps one\r\nof the best of Balzac's _second_ best. _Béatrix_, a book of more power,\r\nappeals chiefly to those who may be interested in the fact (which\r\napparently _is_ the fact) that the book contains, almost more than any\r\nother, figures taken from real people, such as George Sand--the\r\n\"Camille\" of the novel--and some of those about her. The \"Scènes de la\r\nVie de Province\" are richer in \"magnums.\" _Eugénie Grandet_ is here,\r\nwith a sort of companion, cheerfuller generally, in _Ursule Mirouet_.\r\nThe shorter stories are grouped under the titles of _Les Parisiens en\r\nProvince_ (with the first appearance of _Gaudissart_) and _Les\r\nRivalités_. _Le Lys dans la Vallée_ (which one is sometimes anxiously\r\nbegged to distinguish from \"the lily _of_ the valley,\" otherwise\r\n_muguet_) holds, for some, an almost entirely unique place in Balzac's\r\nwork, or one shared only in part by _Mémoires de Deux Jeunes Mariées_. I\r\nhave never, I think, cared much for either. But there is more strength\r\nin two pairs of volumes which contain some of the author's\r\nmasterpieces--_Les Célibataires_ with _Pierrette_, _Le Curé de Tours_,\r\nand the powerful, if not particularly pleasant, _Un Ménage de\r\nGarçon_;[164] and _Illusions Perdues_, running up well with _Un Grand\r\nHomme de Province à Paris_ and the semi-idyllic _Ève et David_.\r\n\r\nBut I suppose the \"Scenes of Parisian Life\" seem to be the citadel to\r\nmost people. Here are three of the four books specially selected above,\r\n_Le Père Goriot_ and both the constituents of _Les Parents Pauvres_.\r\nHere are the _Splendeurs et Misères des Courtisanes_, which some rank\r\namong the very first; not a few short stories in the volumes taking\r\ntheir titles from _La Dernière Incarnation de Vautrin_ and _La Maison\r\nNucingen_; with _César Birotteau_ (_Balzac on Bankruptcy_, as it has\r\nbeen profanely called) and the celebrated _Histoire des Treize_.\r\n\r\nThis last, I confess frankly, has always bored me, even though the\r\nvolume contains _La Fille aux Yeux d'Or_. The idea of a secret society\r\nin Society itself was not new; it was much more worthy of Sue or Soulié\r\nthan of Balzac, and it does not seem to me to have been interestingly\r\nworked out. But perhaps this is due to my perverse and elsewhere\r\nconfessed objection to crime and conspiracy novels generally.\r\n\r\nNeither have I ever cared much for the group of \"Scenes de la Vie\r\nPolitique,\" ranging from _Une Ténébreuse Affaire_ to _Le Député\r\nd'Arcis_, the last being not entirely Balzac's own. The single volume,\r\n\"Scènes de la Vie Militaire,\" consisting merely of _Les Chouans_ and\r\n_Une Passion dans le Désert_, is much better, and the \"Scènes de la Vie\r\nde Campagne\" reach a high level with _Le Médecin de Campagne_, _Le Curé\r\nde Village_, and the late, grim, but very noteworthy _Les Paysans_.\r\n\r\nNone, however, of these sometimes rather arbitrary groups of Balzac's\r\ncontains such thoroughly satisfactory matter as that which he chose to\r\ncall \"Études Philosophiques.\" It includes only one full-volume novel,\r\nbut that is the _Peau de Chagrin_ itself.[165] And here are most of the\r\nshort stories singled out at first, _La Recherche de l'Absolu_, _Jésus\r\nChrist en Flandre_, _Le Chef-d'oeuvre Inconnu_, with _Melmoth\r\nRéconcilié_[166] in the same batch. The two volumes entitled _L'Enfant\r\nMaudit_ and _Les Marana_ contain all but a dozen remarkable tales. Here,\r\ntoo, is the curious treatise _Sur Cathérine de Médicis_, with another,\r\nto some people among the most interesting of all, the autobiographic\r\n_Louis Lambert_, and also the mystical, and in parts very beautiful,\r\n_Séraphita_.\r\n\r\nThe \"Études Analytiques,\" which complete the original _Comédie_ with the\r\ntwo notorious volumes of _Physiologie du Marriage_ and _Petites Misères\r\nde la Vie Conjugale_, are not novels or tales, and so do not concern\r\nus. They are not the only instance in literature showing that the\r\nsarcasm\r\n\r\n    The _God_ you took from a printed book\r\n\r\nextends to other things besides divinity. The old conventional satires\r\non marriage are merely rehashed with some extra garlic. Balzac had no\r\npersonal experience of the subject till just before his death, and his\r\nsingular claustral habits of life could not give him much opportunity\r\nfor observation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Balzacity\": its constitution.]\r\n\r\nExperience, indeed, and observation (to speak with only apparent\r\nparadox), though they played an important, yet played only a subordinate\r\npart at any time in the great Balzacian achievement. Victor Hugo, in\r\nwhat was in effect a funeral oration, described that achievement as \"un\r\nlivre qui est l'Observation et qui est l'Imagination.\" But no one\r\nfamiliar with the Victorian rhetoric will mistake the _clou_, the\r\ndominating and decisive word of that sentence. It is the conjunction.\r\nHugo meant to draw attention to the astonishing _union_ of Imagination\r\nwith Observation--two things which, except in the highest poetry, are\r\napt to be rather strangers to each other--and by putting Imagination\r\nlast he meant also doubtless that this was the dominating--the\r\nmasculine--element in the marriage. In the immense volume of discussion\r\nof Balzac which the long lifetime succeeding his death has seen, and\r\nwhich thickened and multiplied towards the close of the last century and\r\na little later--owing to the conclusion of the _Édition Définitive_ with\r\nits additions and illustrative matter--this point has perhaps been too\r\nfrequently lost sight of. The great critics who were his contemporaries\r\nand immediate survivors were rather too near. The greatest of the later\r\nbatch, M. Brunetière, was a little too eager to use Balzac as a stick to\r\nbeat the Romantics with for one thing, and to make him out a pioneer of\r\nall succeeding French fiction for another. But, quite early, Philarète\r\nChasles hit the white by calling him a _voyant_ (a word slightly varying\r\nin signification from our \"seer\"), and recently a critic of less repute\r\nthan Brunetière, but a good one--M. Le Breton--though perhaps sometimes\r\nnot quite fair to Balzac, recognises his Romanticism, his _frénésie_,\r\nand so the Imagination of which the lunatic and the lover are--and of\r\nwhich the devotee of Romance in verse and prose should be--compact.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it would be of course highly improper, and in fact absurd,\r\nto deny the \"observation\"--at least in detail of all kinds. Although--as\r\nwe have seen and may see again when we come to Naturalism and look\r\nback--M. Brunetière was quite wrong in thinking that Balzac _introduced_\r\n\"interiors\" to French, and still more wrong in thinking that he\r\nintroduced them to European, novel-writing, they undoubtedly make a\r\ngreat show in his work--are, indeed, one of its chief characteristics.\r\nHe actually overdoes them sometimes; the \"dragging\" of _Les Chouans_ is\r\nat least partly due to this, and he never got complete mastery of his\r\ntendency that way. But undoubtedly this tendency was also a source of\r\npower.\r\n\r\nYet, while this observation of _things_ is not to be denied, Balzac's\r\nobservation of _persons_ is a matter much more debatable. To listen to\r\nsome of the more uncritical--especially among the older and now almost\r\ntraditional--estimates of him, an unwary reader who did not correct\r\nthese, judging for himself, might think that Balzac was as much of an\r\n\"observational\" realist in character as Fielding, as Scott when it\r\nserved his turn, as Miss Austen, or as Thackeray. Longer study and\r\nfurther perspective seem recently to have put more people in the\r\nposition which only a few held some years ago. The astonishing force,\r\ncompleteness, _relative_ reality of his creations is more and more\r\nadmitted, but it is seen (M. Le Breton, for instance, admits it in\r\nalmost the very words) that the reality is often not _positive_. In fact\r\nthe _Comédie_ may remind some of the old nautical laudation of a ship\r\nwhich cannot only sail close to the wind, but even a point or two on the\r\nother side of it. If even Frenchmen now confess that Balzac's characters\r\nare very often not _des êtres réels_, no Englishman need be ashamed of\r\nhaving always thought so.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that this giant in novel-writing did actually succeed in\r\ndoing what some of his brethren in _Hyperion_ would have liked to do--in\r\nsetting up a new world for himself and getting out of the existing\r\nuniverse. His characters are never _in_human; they never fail to be\r\nhuman; they are of the same flesh and blood, the same soul and spirit,\r\nas ourselves. But they have, as it were, colonised the fresh planet--the\r\nBalzacium Sidus--and taken new colour and form from its\r\nidiosyncrasies.[167]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its effect on successors.]\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason that one hesitates to endorse the opinions quoted\r\nabove as to the filiation of all or most subsequent French fiction upon\r\nBalzac. Of course he had a great influence on it; such a genius, in such\r\ncircumstances, could not but have. The \"interior\" business was largely\r\nfollowed and elaborated; it might be argued--though the contention would\r\nhave to be strictly limited and freely provisoed--that Naturalism in\r\ngeneral--as the \"Rougon-Macquart\" scheme certainly was in\r\nparticular--was a sort of bastard of the _Comédie_. Other points of\r\nrelationship might be urged. But all this would leave the most\r\ncharacteristic Balzacities untouched. In the most obvious and\r\nsuperficial quality--pessimistic psychology--the other novelist dealt\r\nwith in this chapter--Beyle--is far more of a real origin than Balzac\r\nis. If one takes the most brilliant of his successors outside the\r\nNaturalist school--Flaubert and Feuillet--very little that is really\r\nBalzacian will be found in either. At least _Madame Bovary_ and _M. de\r\nCamors_--which, I suppose, most people would choose to represent the\r\ngreatest genius and the most flexible talent of the Second Empire in\r\nnovel-writing--seem to me to show hardly anything that is like Balzac.\r\nThe Goncourts have something of degraded Balzacianism on its lower side\r\nin them, and Zola approaches, at least in his \"apocalyptic\" period,\r\nsomething like a similar though less offensive degradation of the\r\nhigher. But I can hardly conceive anything less like Balzac's work than\r\nMaupassant's.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And its own character.]\r\n\r\nFor the fact is that the real Balzac lies--to and for me--almost\r\nentirely in that _aura_ of other-worldliness of which I have spoken. It\r\nis in the revelation of this other world, so like ours and yet not the\r\nsame; in the exploration of its continents; in the frequentation of its\r\ninhabitants; that the pleasure which he has to give consists. How he\r\ncame himself to discover it is as undiscoverable as how his in some sort\r\nanalogue Dickens, after pottering not unpleasantly with Bozeries,\r\n\"thought of Mr. Pickwick,\" and so of the rest of _his_ human (and\r\nextra-human) comedy. But the facts, in both cases fortunately, remain.\r\nAnd it may be possible to indicate at least some qualities and\r\ncharacteristics of the fashion in which he dealt with this world when he\r\n_had_ discovered it. In _Les Chouans_ he had found out not so much it,\r\nas the way to it; in the books between that and _La Peau de Chagrin_ he\r\nwas over the border, and with _La Peau_ itself he had \"crossed\r\nJordan,\"--it was all conquest and extension--as far as permitted--of\r\nterritory afterwards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"occult\" element.]\r\n\r\nThere can, I should suppose, be very little doubt that the fancy for the\r\noccult, which played a great part, as far as bulk goes, in the\r\n_Juvenilia_, but produced nothing of value there, began to bear fruit at\r\nthis time. The Supernatural (as was remarked of woman to the indignation\r\nof Mr. Snodgrass) is a \"rum creetur.\" It is very difficult to deal with;\r\nto the last degree unsatisfactory when of bad quality and badly handled;\r\nbut possessing almost infinite capabilities of exhibiting excellence,\r\nand conveying enjoyment. Of course, during the generation before\r\nBalzac's birth and also that between his birth and 1830, the Terror\r\nNovel--from the _Castle of Otranto_ to Maturin--had circled through\r\nEurope, and \"Illuminism\" of various kinds had taken particular hold of\r\nFrance just before the Revolution. But Balzac's \"Occult,\" like Balzac's\r\neverything, was not the same as anybody else's. Whether you take it in\r\n_La Peau de Chagrin_ itself, or in _Séraphita_, or anywhere, it\r\nconsists, again, rather in atmosphere than in \"figures.\" A weaker genius\r\nwould have attached to the skin of that terrible wild ass--gloomier, but\r\nmore formidable than even the beast in Job[168]--some attendant evil\r\nspirit, genie, or \"person\" of some sort. A bit of shagreen externally,\r\nshrinking--with age--perhaps? with weather?--what not?--a life shrinking\r\nin mysterious sympathy--that is what was wanted and what you have,\r\nwithout ekings, or explanations, or other trumpery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its action and reaction.]\r\n\r\nNor is it only in the ostensibly \"occult\" or (as he was pleased to call\r\nthem) \"philosophic\" studies and and stories that you get this\r\natmosphere. It spreads practically everywhere--the very bankruptcies and\r\nthe sordid details of town and country life are overshadowed and in a\r\ncertain sense _dis_-realised by it. Indeed that verb which, like most\r\nnew words, has been condemned by some precisians, but which was much\r\nwanted, applies to no prose writer quite so universally as to Balzac. He\r\nis a _dis_-realiser, not by style as some are, but in thought--at the\r\nvery same time that he gives such impressions of realism. Sometimes, but\r\nnot often, he comes quite close to real mundane reality, sometimes, as\r\nin the most \"philosophical\" of the so-called philosophical works, he\r\nhardly attempts a show of it. But as a rule when he is at his very best,\r\nas in _La Peau de Chagrin_, in _La Recherche de l'Absolu_, in _Le\r\nChef-d'oeuvre Inconnu_, he attains a kind of point of unity between\r\ndisrealising and realising--he disrealises the common and renders the\r\nuncommon real in a fashion actually carrying out what he can never have\r\nknown--the great Coleridgian definition or description of poetry. In\r\nfact, if prose-poetry were not a contradiction in terms, Balzac would\r\nbe, except in style,[169] the greatest prose-poet of them all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peculiarity of the conversation.]\r\n\r\nOn[170] one remarkable characteristic of the _Comédie_ very little has\r\nusually been said. It has been neglected wholly by most critics, though\r\nit is of the very first importance. And that is the astonishingly small\r\nuse, _in proportion_, which Balzac makes of that great weapon of the\r\nnovelist, dialogue, and the almost smaller effect which it accordingly\r\nhas in producing his results (whatever they are) on his readers. With\r\nsome novelists dialogue is almost all-powerful. Dumas, for instance (as\r\nis pointed out elsewhere), does almost everything by it. In his best\r\nbooks especially you may run the eye over dozens, scores, almost\r\nhundreds of pages without finding a single one printed \"solid.\" The\r\nauthor seldom makes any reflections at all; and his descriptions, with,\r\nof course, some famous exceptions, are little more than longish stage\r\ndirections. Nor is this by any means merely due to early practice in the\r\ndrama itself; for something like it is to be found in writers who have\r\nhad no such practice. In Balzac, after making every allowance for the\r\nfact that he often prints his actual conversations without typographical\r\nseparation of the speeches, the case is just the other way. Moreover,\r\nand this is still more noteworthy, it is not by what his characters do\r\nsay that we remember them. The situation perhaps most of all; the\r\ncharacter itself very often; the story sometimes (but of that more\r\npresently)--these are the things for and by which we remember Balzac and\r\nthe vast army of his creations; while sometimes it is not even for any\r\nof these things, but for \"interiors,\" \"business,\" and the like. When one\r\nthinks of single points in him, it is scarcely ever of such things as\r\nthe \"He has got his discharge, by----!\" of Dickens; as the \"Adsum\" of\r\nThackeray; as the \"Trop lourd!\" of Porthos' last agony; as the longer\r\nbut hardly less quintessenced malediction of Habakkuk Mucklewrath on\r\nClaverhouse. It is of Eugénie Grandet shrinking in automatic repulsion\r\nfrom the little bench as she reads her cousin's letter; of Henri de\r\nMarsay's cigar (his enjoyment of it, that is to say, for his words are\r\nquite commonplace) as he leaves \"la Fille aux Yeux d'Or\"; of the lover\r\nallowing himself to be built up in \"La Grande Bretèche.\" Observe that\r\nthere is not the slightest necessity to apportion the excellence implied\r\nin these different kinds of reminiscence; as a matter of fact, each way\r\nof fastening the interest and the appreciation of the reader is\r\nindifferently good.[171] But the distinction remains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And of the \"story\" interest.]\r\n\r\nThere is another point on which, though no good critic can miss it, some\r\ncritics seem to dislike dwelling; and this is that, though Balzac's\r\nseparate situations, as has just been said, are arresting in the highest\r\ndegree, it is often distinctly difficult to read him \"for the story.\"\r\nEven M. Brunetière lets slip an admission that \"interest\" of the\r\nordinary kind is not exactly Balzac's forte; while another admirer of\r\nhis grants freely that his _affabulation_ is weak. Once more, we need\r\nnot and must not make too much of this; but it is important that it\r\nshould not be forgotten, and the extreme Balzacian is sometimes apt to\r\nforget it. That it comes sometimes from Balzac's mania for rehandling\r\nand reshaping--that he has actually, like the hero of what is to some\r\nhis most unforgettable short story, daubed the masterpiece into a\r\nblur--is certain. But it probably comes more often, and is much more\r\ninteresting as coming, from want of co-ordination between the observing\r\nand the imagining faculties which are (as Hugo meant) the yoked coursers\r\nof Balzac's car.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that _exceptis excipiendis_, of which _Eugénie Grandet_ is\r\nthe chief solid example, it is not by the ordinary means, or in the\r\nordinary ways, that Balzac makes any considerable part of his appeal. He\r\nis very much more _der Einzige_ in novel-writing than Jean Paul was in\r\nnovel-writing or anything else; for a good deal of Richter's uniqueness\r\ndepended[172] upon eccentricities of style, etc., from which Balzac is\r\nentirely free. And the same may be said, with the proper mutations, of\r\nGeorge Meredith. No one ever made less use--despite his \"details\" and\r\n\"interiors\"--of what may be called intellectual or artistic costume and\r\nproperties than the author of the _Comédie Humaine_. The most\r\negotistical of men in certain ways, he never thrusts his _ego_ upon you.\r\nThe most personal in his letters, he is almost as impersonal in most of\r\nhis writings (_Louis Lambert_, etc., being avowedly exceptional) as\r\nShakespeare. Now, though the personal interest may be not illegitimate\r\nand sometimes great, the impersonal is certainly greater. Thanks to\r\nindustrious prying, not always deserving the adjective impertinent, we\r\nknow a great deal about Balzac; and it is by no means difficult to apply\r\nsome of the knowledge to aid the study of his creation. But in reading\r\nthe creation itself you never need this knowledge; it never forces\r\nitself on you. The hundreds, and almost thousands, of persons who form\r\nthe company of the _Comédie_--their frequently recurring parts adjusted\r\nwith extraordinary, though by no means obtrusive or offensive,\r\nconsistency to the enormous world of detail and scenery and general\r\n\"surroundings\" in which their parts are played--are never interfered\r\nwith by the pointing-stick or the prompter. They are _there_; they can't\r\nhelp being there, and you have to make the best or the worst of them as\r\nyou can. Considering the general complexion of this universe, its\r\ninevitableness and apparent [Greek: autarkeia] may seem, in some moods\r\nand to some persons, a little oppressive; it is always, perhaps, as has\r\nbeen admitted, productive rather of admiration than of pleasure. Faults\r\nof various kinds may be found with it. But it is almost always\r\nwonderful; it is often great, and it is sometimes of the greatest.[173]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[124] Of course there are exceptions, _Le Rouge et le Noir_ and _La Peau\r\nde Chagrin_ being perhaps the chief among long novels; while some of\r\nBalzac's short stories possess the quality in almost the highest degree.\r\n\r\n[125] He tried several pseudonyms, but settled on this. Unfortunately,\r\nhe sometimes (not always) made it \"_De_ Stendhal,\" without anything\r\nbefore the \"De,\" and more unfortunately still, in the days of his\r\nNapoleonic employment he, if he had not called himself, had allowed\r\nhimself to be called \"M. _de_ Beyle\"--an assumption which though\r\ndropped, was not forgotten in the days of his later anti-aristocratism.\r\n\r\n[126] Beyle himself recognized the necessity of the reader's\r\ncollaboration.\r\n\r\n[127] This does not apply to poets as much as to prose writers: a fact\r\nfor which reasons could perhaps be given. And it certainly does not\r\napply to Balzac.\r\n\r\n[128] He was now forty-four, and had published not a few volumes, mostly\r\nsmall, of other kinds--travel description (which he did uncommonly\r\nwell), and miscellaneous writing, and criticism, including the famous\r\n_Racine et Shakespeare_, an _avant-coureur_ of Romanticism which\r\ncontained, besides matter on its title-subjects, some sound estimate of\r\nScott as a writer and some very unsound abuse about him as a man. This\r\nlast drew from Byron, who had met Beyle earlier at Milan, a letter of\r\nexpostulation and vindication which did that noble poet infinite credit,\r\nbut of which Beyle, by no means to _his_ credit, took notice. He was\r\nonly too like Hazlitt in more ways than one: though few books with\r\npractically the same title can be more different than _De l'Amour_ and\r\n_Liber Amoris_.\r\n\r\n[129] As for instance, those from Dekker and Massiger; Camoens and\r\nErcilla are allowed their native tongues \"neat.\"\r\n\r\n[130] The actual \"Chartreuse\" of Parma only makes its appearance on the\r\nvery last page of the book, when the hero, resigning his arch bishopric,\r\nretires to it.\r\n\r\n[131] He is the younger son of a rich and noble family, but his father\r\ndisowns and his older brother denounces him quite early. It is\r\ncharacteristic of Beyle that we hear very little of the father and are\r\npractically never even introduced to the brother.\r\n\r\n[132] These four words somehow make me think of Samuel Newcome's comment\r\non the unfortunate dinner where \"Farintosh\" did not appear: \"Scarcely\r\nanything was drank.\"\r\n\r\n[133] See note above.\r\n\r\n[134] Both would have declined to meddle with her, I think, but for\r\ndifferent reasons.\r\n\r\n[135] Beyle, who had himself no good looks, is particularly lavish of\r\nthem to his heroes.\r\n\r\n[136] Perhaps one of the rare biographical details which, as has been\r\nexplained, may \"force the _consigne_\" here, is that Beyle in his youth,\r\nand almost up to middle age, was acquainted with an old lady who had the\r\nvery unenviable reputation of having actually \"sat for\" Madame de\r\nMerteuil.\r\n\r\n[137] This bad bloodedness, or [Greek: kakoêtheia], of Beyle's heroes is\r\nreally curious. It would have qualified them later to be Temperance\r\nfanatics or Trade Union demagogues. The special difference of all three\r\nis an intense dislike of somebody else \"having something.\"\r\n\r\n[138] In that merry and wise book _Clarissa Furiosa_.\r\n\r\n[139] She keeps the anniversary of his execution, and imitates\r\nMarguerite in procuring and treasuring, at the end of the story,\r\nJulien's severed head. (It may be well to note that Dumas had not yet\r\nwritten _La Reine Margot_.)\r\n\r\n[140] In proper duel, of course; not as he shot his mistress.\r\n\r\n[141] Its great defect is the utter absence of any poetical element.\r\nBut, as Mérimée (than whom there could hardly be, in this case, a critic\r\nmore competent or more friendly) said, poetry was, to Beyle, _lettre\r\nclose_.\r\n\r\n[142] It seems curiously enough, that Beyle did mean to make the book\r\n_gai_. It is a a very odd kind of gaiety!\r\n\r\n[143] This attraction of the _forçat_ is one of the most curious\r\nfeatures in all French Romanticism. It was perhaps partly one of the\r\ngeneral results of the Revolutionary insanity earlier, partly a symptom\r\nor sequel of Byronism. But the way it raged not only among folks like\r\nEugène Sue, but among men and women of great talent and sometimes\r\ngenius--George Sand, Balzac, Dumas, Victor Hugo--the last and greatest\r\ncarrying it on for nearly two generations--is a real curiousity of\r\nliterature. (The later and different crime-novel of Gaboriau & Co. will\r\nbe dealt with in its place.)\r\n\r\n[144] _V. sup._ vol. i. p. 39.\r\n\r\n[145] A pseudonymous person has \"reconstituted\" the story under the\r\ntitle of _Lucien Leeuwen_ (the hero's name). But some not inconsiderable\r\nexperience of reconstitutions of this kind determined me to waste no\r\nfurther portion of my waning life on any one of them.\r\n\r\n[146] It may be desirable to glance at Beyle's avowed or obvious\r\n\"intentions\" in most if not all his novels--in the _Chartreuse_ to\r\ndifferentiate Italian from French character, in _Le Rouge et le Noir_ to\r\nembody the Macchiavellian-Napoleonic principle which has been of late so\r\ntediously phrased (after the Germans) as \"will to\" something and the\r\nlike. These intentions may interest some: for me, I must confess, they\r\ndefinitely get in the way of the interest. For essays, \"good\": for\r\nnovels, \"no.\"\r\n\r\n[147] Vide _Guy Mannering_ as to the \"macers.\"\r\n\r\n[148] _Les Chouans._\r\n\r\n[149] Forty vols. London: 1895-8.\r\n\r\n[150] _Quarterly Review_ for January 1907.\r\n\r\n[151] I believe I may say, without fatuity, that the general\r\nIntroduction and the _Quarterly_ article, above referred to, contain\r\nmost things that anybody but a special student will need.\r\n\r\n[152] It is, however, important to remember that almost the whole of the\r\nfirst of these three decades was taken up with the tentatives, while the\r\nconcluding _lustrum_ was comparatively infertile. The _Comédie_ was, in\r\nthe main, the crop of fifteen years only.\r\n\r\n[153] It ought always to be, but has not always been, put as a round sum\r\nto his credit in this part of the account that he heartily recognised\r\nthe value of Scott as a novelist. A hasty thinker might be surprised at\r\nthis; not so the wiser mind.\r\n\r\n[154] This remarkable person deserves at least a note here \"for one\r\nthing that he did\"--the novel of _Fragoletta_ (1829), which many should\r\nknow _of_--though they may not know _it_--from Mr. Swinburne's poem, and\r\nsome perhaps from Balzac's own review. It is one of the followings of\r\n_La Religieuse_, and is a disappointing book, not from being too immoral\r\nnor from being not immoral enough, but because it does not \"come off.\"\r\nThere is a certain promise, suggestion, \"atmosphere,\" but the actual\r\ncharacterisation is vague and obscure, and the story is told with no\r\ngrasp. This habit of \"flashing in the pan\" is said to have been\r\ncharacteristic of all Latouche's work, which was fairly voluminous and\r\nof many different kinds, from journalism to poetry; and it may have been\r\npartly due to, partly the cause of, a cross-grained disposition. He had,\r\nhowever, a high repute for spoken if not written criticism, had a great\r\ninfluence as a trainer or mentor on George Sand, and perhaps not a\r\nlittle on Balzac himself. During the later years of his fairly long life\r\nhe lived in retirement and produced nothing.\r\n\r\n[155] One of the friends who have read my proofs takes a more\r\nAlexandrian way with this objection and says \"But there _are_.\" I do not\r\nknow that I disagree with him: but as he does not disagree with what\r\nfollows in itself, both answers shall stand.\r\n\r\n[156] Cf. Maupassant's just protest against this, to which we shall\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n[157] An actual reduction of Balzac's books to smaller but still\r\nnarrative scale is very seldom possible and would be still more rarely\r\nsatisfactory. The best substitute for it is the already glanced at\r\n_Répertoire_ of MM. Christophe and Cerfbeer, a curious but very\r\nsatisfactory Biographical Dictionary of the Comedy's _personae_.\r\n\r\n[158] \"Sans génie je suis flambé,\" as he wrote early to his sister.\r\n\r\n[159] This is about the best of the batch, and I agree with those who\r\nthink that it would not have disfigured the _Comédie_. Indeed the\r\nexclusion of these _juvenilia_ from the _Édition Définitive_ was a\r\ncritical blunder. Even if Balzac did once wish it, the \"dead hand\" is\r\nnot to be too implicitly given way to, and he was so constantly changing\r\nhis views that he probably would have altered this also had he lived.\r\n\r\n[160] A certain kind of commentator would probably argue from Mr.\r\nBrowning's well-known words \"_fifty_ volumes long\" that he _had_, and\r\nanother that he had _not_ read the _Oeuvres de Jeunesse_.\r\n\r\n[161] He would not have liked the name \"patriot\" because of its\r\ncorruption, but he was one.\r\n\r\n[162] Not a few things, some of them very good, came between--the\r\npleasant _Maison du Chat-qui-Pelote_, several of the wonderful short\r\nstories, and the beginning of the _Contes Drolatiques_. But none of them\r\nhad the \"importance\"--in the artistic sense of combined merit and\r\nscale--of the _Peau_.\r\n\r\n[163] I mean, of course, as far as books go. We have positive testimony\r\nthat there was a live Becky, and I would I had known her!\r\n\r\n[164] Originally and perhaps preferably called _La Rabouilleuse_ from\r\nthe early occupation of its heroine, Flore Brazier, one of Balzac's most\r\nnotable figures.\r\n\r\n[165] It is one of the strangest instances of the limitations of some of\r\nthe best critics that M. Brunetière declined even to speak of this great\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n[166] The immense influence of Maturin in France, and especially on\r\nBalzac, is an old story now, though it was not always so.\r\n\r\n[167] It is possible that some readers may miss a more extended survey,\r\nor at least sample, of these characters. But the plea made above as to\r\nabstract of the stories is valid here. There is simply not room to do\r\njustice to say, Lucien de Rubempré, who pervades a whole block of novels\r\nand stories, or to others from Rastignac to Corentin.\r\n\r\n[168] It has sometimes occurred to me that perhaps the skin _was_ that\r\nof Job's onager.\r\n\r\n[169] He does try a sort of pseudo-poetical style sometimes; but it is\r\nseldom successful, and sometimes mere \"fine-writing\" of no very fine\r\nkind. The close of _Peau de Chagrin_ and _Séraphita_ contain about the\r\nbest passages.\r\n\r\n[170] The two next paragraphs are, by the kind permission of the Editor\r\nand Publisher of the _Quarterly Review_, reprinted, with some slight\r\nalterations, from the article above referred to.\r\n\r\n[171] I have known this denied by persons of authority, who would exalt\r\nthe gift of conversation even above the pure narrative faculty. I should\r\nadmit the latter was commoner, but hardly that it was inferior.\r\n\r\n[172] I believe I may speak without rashness thus, for a copy of the\r\nsixteen-volume (was it not?) edition was a cherished possession of mine\r\nfor years, and I even translated a certain amount for my own\r\namusement--especially _Die unsichtbare Loge_.\r\n\r\n[173] I have said nothing here on a point of considerable interest to\r\nmyself--the question whether Balzac can be said ever (or at least often)\r\nto have drawn a gentleman or a lady. It would require too much\r\n\"justification\" by analysis of particular characters. And this would\r\npass into a more general enquiry whether these two species exist in the\r\nBalzacium Sidus itself. Which things open long vistas. (_V. inf._ on\r\nCharles de Bernard.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nGEORGE SAND\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: George Sand--generalities about her.]\r\n\r\nThere is a Scotch proverb (not, I think, among those most generally\r\nknown), \"Never tell your foe when your foot sleeps\"; and some have held\r\nthat this applies specially to the revelation, by an author, of his own\r\nweak points. I do not agree with them, having always had a fancy for\r\nplaying and seeing cards on table--except at cards themselves, where a\r\ndummy seems to me only to spoil the game. Therefore I admit, in coming\r\nto George Sand, that this famous novelist has not, _as_ a novelist, ever\r\nbeen a favourite of mine--that I have generally experienced some, and\r\noccasionally great, difficulty in reading her. Even the \"purged\r\nconsiderate mind\" (without, I venture to hope, much dulling of the\r\nliterary palate) which I have brought to the last readings necessary for\r\nthis book, has but partially removed this difficulty. The causes of it,\r\nand their soundness or unsoundness as reasons, must be postponed for a\r\nlittle--till, as usual, sufficient survey and analysis of at least\r\nspecimens (for here as elsewhere the immense bulk of the total work\r\ndefies anything more than \"sampling\") have supplied due evidence. But it\r\nmay be said at once that no kind of prejudice or dislike, arising from\r\nthe pretty notorious history and character of Amantine (Amandine?\r\nArmandine?) Lucile Aurore Dupin or Dudevant, commonly called George\r\nSand, has anything to do with my want of affection or admiration for her\r\nwork. I do not recommend her conduct in her earlier days for imitation,\r\nand I am bound to say that I do not think it was ever excused by what\r\none may call real love. But she seems to have been an extremely good\r\nfellow in her age, and not by any means a very bad fellow in her youth.\r\nShe was at one time pretty, or at least good-looking;[174] she was at\r\nall times clever; and if she did not quite deserve that almost\r\nsuperhuman eulogy awarded in the Devonshire epitaph to\r\n\r\n    Mary Sexton,\r\n    Who pleased many a man and never vexed one,[175]\r\n\r\nshe did fulfil the primal duty of her sex, and win its greatest triumph,\r\nby complying with the first half of the line, while, if she failed as to\r\nthe second, it was perhaps not entirely her fault.[176] Finally,\r\nBalzac's supposed picture of her as Camille in _Béatrix_ has the almost\r\nunique peculiarity, among its author's sketches of women, of being\r\npositively attractive--attractive, that is to say, not merely to the\r\ncritic as a powerful study and work of art; not perhaps at all to the\r\nsentimentalist as a victim or an adorable piece of _candeur_; not to the\r\nlover of physical beauty or passion, but to the reader--\"sensible\" in\r\nthe old sense as well as in the new--who feels that here is a woman he\r\nshould like to have known, even if he feels likewise that his\r\nweather-eye would have had to be kept open during the knowledge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Phases of her work.]\r\n\r\nIt has been customary--and though these customary things are sometimes\r\ndelusive and too often mechanical, there is also occasionally, and, I\r\nthink, here, her work, something not negligible in them, if they be not\r\napplied too rigidly--to divide George Sand's long period (nearly half a\r\ncentury) of novel-production into four sub-periods, corresponding\r\nroughly with the four whole decades of the thirties, forties, fifties,\r\nand sixties.[177] The first, sometimes called, but, I think,\r\nmisleadingly, \"Romantic,\" is the period of definite and mainly sexual\r\nrevolt, illustrated by such novels as _Indiana_, _Valentine_, _Lélia_,\r\nand _Jacques_. The second is that of _illuminé_ mysticism and\r\nsemi-political theorising, to which _Spiridion_, _Consuelo_, _La\r\nComtesse de Rudolstadt_, and others belong. The third, one of a certain\r\n_apaisement_, when the author had finally settled at her country-house\r\nof Nohant in Berry, turns to studies of rural life: _La Petite Fadette_,\r\n_François le Champi_, _La Mare au Diable_, etc. The last is represented\r\nby novels of no one particular, or at least single, scope or bent, _Les\r\nBeaux Messieurs de Bois-Doré_, _Le Marquis de Villemer_, _Mademoiselle\r\nLa Quintinie,_ etc., reaching to _Flamarande_ and its sequel shortly\r\nbefore her death. The thing, as has been hinted already, is one of those\r\nfirst rough sketches of the ground which, if not too closely adhered to,\r\nare often useful. As a matter of fact, the divisions often--as one might\r\nbe sure they would--run cross. There is a lot of occult or semi-occult\r\nstuff in _Lélia_, and the \"period of appeasement\" did not show much\r\nreconciliation and forgiveness of injury in _Elle et Lui_, whether we\r\ntake this as by the injured or as by her who had done the wrong. But if\r\nwe take the two first novels briefly and _Lélia_ itself more fully for\r\nPeriod I.; _Consuelo_ and its sequel (_Spiridion_ has been \"done and\r\ndone thoroughly\"[178] by Thackeray in the _Paris Sketch-book_) for II.;\r\nthe three above-mentioned _berquinades_ for the Third, with _Lucrezia\r\nFloriani_ thrown between as an all-important outsider, and _Les Beaux\r\nMessieurs de Bois-Doré_ for IV., giving each some detailed criticism,\r\nwith a few remarks on others, it ought to suffice as a fairly solid\r\ngroundwork for a general summing-up.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Indiana_.]\r\n\r\nTo understand the _furore_ with which _Indiana_ and _Valentine_ were\r\nreceived, one must remember the time and the circumstance with even more\r\ncare than is usually desirable. They were--if not quite so well written\r\nas they seemed even to Thackeray--written very well; they expressed the\r\nfull outburst of the French _Sturm und Drang_ movement; there was\r\nnothing like them either in French or in any other literature, though\r\nBulwer was beginning similar things with us. Essentially, and when taken\r\n_sub specie aeternitatis_, they are very nearly rubbish. The frail\r\n(extremely frail) and gentle Indiana, with her terrible husband, whose\r\ncrimes against her and nature even reach the abominable pitch of\r\ndeclaring himself ready to shoot expected poachers and possible\r\nburglars; her creole maid and foster-sister \"Noun,\" who disguises\r\nherself in Indiana's garments and occupies her room, receives there a\r\nlover who is afterwards her mistress's, but soon commits suicide; the\r\nlover himself, a most appalling \"tiger,\" as his own time would have\r\ncalled him; and the enigmatic English cousin, indifferently designated\r\nas \"Sir Rodolphe Brown,\" \"Sir Ralph,\" \"Sir Brown,\" and \"M. Brown,\" with\r\nwhom Indiana makes a third trial of hitherto \"incomprised\" and\r\nunattained happiness--are all inhabitants of a sort of toy doll's-house\r\npartaking of the lunatic-asylum. But the author's three prefaces,\r\nwritten at intervals of exactly ten years, passably inconsistent in\r\ndetail, but all agreeing in contempt of critics and lofty anarchist\r\nsentiment, are great fun, and are almost a reward for reading the book.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Valentine._]\r\n\r\n_Valentine_ has more of the really admirable description of her beloved\r\nBerry with which the author so often honeys her drugs; but the\r\nnovel-part of it is largely composed of the same sort of violent bosh\r\nwhich almost monopolises _Indiana_. In fact, the peasant-_bourgeois_\r\nhero Benedict, whom every woman loves; who is a conceited and\r\nill-mannered mixture of clown and prig; who is angry with his mistress\r\nValentine (Madame de Lansac) for \"not knowing how to prefer him to her\r\nhonour,\" though one would have said she had given ample proofs of this\r\npreference; and who finally appeases the reader by tumbling on the\r\npoints of a pitchfork placed in his way by an (as it happens) unduly\r\njealous husband, is a more offensive creature than any one in the\r\nearlier book.[179] One is, on the other hand, a little sorry for\r\nValentine, while one is sorry for nobody in _Indiana_ except perhaps for\r\nthe husband, who has the sense to die early.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Lélia._]\r\n\r\n_Lélia_, some years younger than these and later than the Musset\r\ntragedy, is a good deal better, or at least less childish. It is beyond\r\nall question an extraordinary book, though it may be well to keep the\r\nhyphen in the adjective to prevent confusion of sense. It opens, and to\r\na large extent continues, with a twist of the old epistolary style\r\nwhich, if nothing else, is ingeniously novel. George Sand was in truth a\r\n\"well of ingenuity\" as D'Artagnan was a _puits de sagesse_, and this\r\naccounts, to some extent, for her popularity. You have not only no dates\r\nand no places, but no indication who writes the letters or to whom they\r\nare written, though, unless you are very stupid, you soon find out. The\r\n_personae_ are Lélia--a _femme incomprise_, if not incomprehensible;\r\nSténio, a young poet, who is, in the profoundest and saddest sense of\r\nthe adverb, hopelessly in love with her; and a mysterious personage--a\r\nsort of Solomon-Socrates-Senancour--who bears the Ossianesque name of\r\nTrenmor, with a later and less provincially poetical _alias_ of\r\n\"Valmarina.\"[180] The history of the _preuves_ of Trenmor's\r\nnovel-nobility are soon laid before the reader. They are not, in their\r\nearlier stages, engaging to the old-fashioned believer in \"good form.\"\r\n\r\nTrenmor is the sort of exaggeration of Childe Harold which a lively but\r\nrather vulgar mind might conceive. \"He was born great; but they\r\ndeveloped the animal in him.\" The greatness postponed its appearance,\r\nbut the animality did credit to the development. \"He used to love to\r\nbeat his dogs; before long he beat his prostitutes.\" This harmless\r\ndiversion accentuated itself in details, for which, till the acme, the\r\nreader must be referred to the original. The climacteric moment came. He\r\nhad a mistress called \"La Mantovana,\" whom he rather preferred to the\r\nothers, because she was beautiful and impudent. \"In a night of noise and\r\nwine\" he struck her, and she drew a dagger. This made him love her for a\r\nmoment; but unfortunately she made an improper observation; thereupon he\r\ntore off her pearl necklace and trod it under his feet. She wept. This\r\nannoyed Trenmor very much. \"She had wished revenge for a personal\r\ninsult, and she cried for a toy!\" Accordingly he had a \"crispation of\r\nnerves,\" which obliged him to take a large cut-glass decanter and hit\r\nher on the head with it. According to the natural perversity on such\r\noccasions of such persons, she died. The brutal justice of mankind--so\r\nhateful to Godwin and George Sand and Victor Hugo--sent Trenmor, not,\r\nindeed, to the gallows, as it should have done, but to the galleys. Yet\r\nthe incident made Lélia, who (she must have had a sweet set of friends)\r\nsomehow knew him, very fond of Trenmor, though she certainly told him\r\nthat he might as well repent of what he had done, which seems\r\ninconsistent.\r\n\r\nThey let him out after five years (why, Heaven or the other\r\nplace knows!) and he became a reformed character--the\r\nSolomon-Socrates-Senancour above mentioned _plus_ a sort of lay\r\n\"director\" to Lélia, with a carbonaro attitude of political\r\nrevolutionary and free-thinking _illuminé_. Now _corruptio pessimi_ is\r\nseldom _optima_.\r\n\r\nThe main interest, however, shifts (with apparitions of\r\nTrenmor-Valmarina) to the loves (if they may be called so) of the\r\npitiable Sténio and the intolerable heroine. She is unable to love\r\nanybody, and knows it; she can talk--ye Demons, how she can talk!--but\r\nshe can never behave like a woman of this world. She alternately hugs\r\nSténio, so that she nearly squeezes his breath out, and, when he draws\r\nnatural conclusions from this process, pushes him away. But worse and\r\nmore preposterous things happen. Lélia has a sister, Pulchérie, who is\r\nvery like her (they are of course both impossibly beautiful) in body,\r\nand so far resembles her in mind and soul as to be unable to behave\r\ndecently or sensibly. But her want of decency and sense takes the more\r\ncommonplace line of becoming an actual courtesan of the \"Imperia\" kind\r\nin Italy. By a series of muddles for which Lélia is--as her plain-spoken\r\nsister points out after the catastrophe--herself really responsible,\r\nSténio is induced, during the excitement of an _al fresco_ fête at night\r\nin the grounds of a sort of fairy palace, to take the \"coming\" sister\r\nfor the recalcitrant one, and avail himself of her complaisance, _usque\r\nad finem_. Lélia reproaches him (which she has not the least right to\r\ndo), and he devotes himself entirely to Pulchérie (La Zinzolina is her\r\nprofessional name) and her group of noble paramours. He gets, however,\r\ngenerally drunk and behaves with a brutal rudeness, which would, in the\r\nItaly of tradition, have finished things up very soon by a stiletto\r\nthrust, and in honest England by a kicking into the street. There are\r\nmysterious plots, cardinals, and anything else you like or don't like.\r\nLélia becomes an abbess, Sténio a suicide, the above-mentioned priest,\r\nMagnus, being much concerned in this. She admits her unfortunate lover\r\nto burial, and is degraded and imprisoned for it--or for having saved\r\nTrenmor-Valmarina from the law. Everybody else now dies, and the\r\nnightmare comes to an end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The moral of the group and its tragi-comedy.]\r\n\r\nThe beauties of style which softened the savage breast of Thackeray\r\nhimself in the notice above mentioned, and which, such as they are,\r\nappear even in George Sand's earliest work, will receive attention when\r\nthat work comes to be discussed as a whole. Meanwhile, at the risk of\r\nany charge of Philistinism, I confess that this part of it seems to me,\r\nafter fifty years and more of \"corrected impression,\" almost worthless\r\n_au fond_. It is, being in prose, and therefore destitute of the\r\neasements or at least masquerades which poetry provides for nonsense,\r\nthe most conspicuous and considerable example--despite the undoubted\r\ntalent of the writer--of the mischief which Byronism did on the\r\nContinent. With us, though it made a great stir, it really did little\r\nharm except to some \"silly women\" (as the apostle, in unkindly and\r\nuncourtly, but truly apostolic fashion, had called similar persons of\r\nthe angelic sex ages before). Counter-jumpers like Thackeray's own\r\nPogson worshipped \"the noble poet\"; boys of nobler stamp like Tennyson\r\n_thought_ they worshipped him, but if they were going to become men of\r\naffairs forgot all about him; if they were to be poets took to Keats and\r\nShelley as models, not to him. Critics hardly took him seriously, except\r\nfor non-literary reasons. There was, as I think somebody (perhaps\r\nThackeray himself) says upon something, \"too much roast beef about\" for\r\nus to fill our bellies with this worse than east wind of Sensibility\r\ngone rotten. But abroad, for reasons which would be easy but irrelevant\r\nto dwell upon, Byron hit the many-winged bird of popular favour on\r\nnearly all its pinions. He ran strikingly and delightfully contrary to\r\nthe accepted _Anglais_, whether of the philosophical or the caricature\r\ntype; he was noble, but revolutionary; he looked (he never was, except\r\nin non-essentials) Romantic; he was new, naughty, nice, all at once. And\r\nthey went mad over him, and to a large extent and for a long time\r\nremained so; indeed, Continental criticism, whether Latin, Teutonic,\r\nScandinavian, or Slav, has never reached \"the centre\" about Byron. Now\r\nGeorge Sand was at no time exactly a silly woman, but she was for a long\r\ntime a woman off her balance. Byronism was exactly the -ism with which\r\nshe could execute the wildest feats of half-voluntary and\r\nhalf-involuntary acrobatics, saltimbanquery, and chucking of her bonnet\r\nover all conceivable and inconceivable mills. Childe Harold, Manfred,\r\nConrad, Lara, Don Juan, Sardanapalus--the shades of these caught her\r\nand waltzed with her and reversed and figured and gesticulated,\r\n\r\n     With their Sentimentalibus lacrimae rorum, and pathos and\r\n     bathos delightful to see,\r\n\r\n--or perhaps _not_ so very delightful?\r\n\r\nBut let us pass to the next stage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Consuelo._]\r\n\r\nThose persons (I think, without tempting Nemesis too much, I might say\r\nthose fortunate persons) to whom the world of books is almost as real as\r\nthe other two worlds of life and of dream, may or must have observed\r\nthat the conditions and sensations of the individual in all three are\r\nvery much the same. In particular, the change from a state of discomfort\r\nto one of comfort--or _vice versa_ unluckily, but with that we have\r\nnothing immediately to do--applies to all. In actual life you are hot,\r\ntired, bored, headachy, \"spited with fools,\" what not. A change of\r\natmosphere, a bath, a draught of some not unfermented liquor, the sight\r\nof a face, what not again, nay, sometimes a mere shift of clothing, will\r\nmake you cool, satisfied, at peace. In dreams you have generally to\r\nwake, to shake off the \"fierce vexation,\" and to realise that it _is_ a\r\ndream; but the relief comes sooner or later. If anybody wants to\r\nexperience this change from discomfort to comfort in the book-world of a\r\nsingle author, I cannot commend anything better than the perusal, with a\r\nshort interval--but there should be some--of _Consuelo_ after _Lélia_.\r\nWe may have some things to say against the later novel; but that does\r\nnot matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Much better in parts.]\r\n\r\nIt opens with no tricks or _tours de force_; in no atmosphere of\r\ndarkened footlights and smell of sawdust; but in frank and free\r\nnovel-fashion, with a Venetian church, a famous maestro (Porpora), a\r\nchoir of mostly Italian girls, and the little Spanish gipsy Consuelo,\r\nthe poorest, humblest, plainest (as most people think) of all the bevy,\r\nbut the possessor of the rarest vocal faculties and the most\r\nhappiness-producing-and-diffusing temper. There is nothing in the least\r\nmilk-soppy or prudish about Consuelo, though she is perfectly \"pure\";\r\nnor is there anything tractified about her, though she is pious and\r\ngenerous. The contrast between her and her betrothed, the handsome but\r\nworthless Anzoleto, also a singer, is, at first, not overworked; and one\r\nscene--that in which, when Consuelo has got over the \"scraggy\" age and\r\nis developing actual beauty, she and Anzoleto debate, in the most\r\nnatural manner, whether she _is_ pretty or not--is quite capital, one of\r\nthe things that stick in one's memory and stamp the writer's genius, or,\r\nat any rate, consummate talent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The degeneration.]\r\n\r\nThis happy state of affairs continues without much deterioration, though\r\nperhaps with some warnings to the experienced, for some two hundred\r\npages. The situations and the other characters--the Professor Porpora\r\nhimself; Count Zustiniani, _dilettante_, _impresario_ and of course\r\ngallant; his _prima donna_ and (in the story at least) first mistress,\r\nLa Corilla; her extravagances and seduction of the handsome Anzoleto;\r\nhis irresolution between his still existing affection for Consuelo, who\r\npasses through all these things (and Zustiniani's siege of her) \"in\r\nmaiden meditation, fancy-free\"--all discharge themselves or play their\r\nparts quite as they ought to do. But this comparatively quiet, though by\r\nno means emotionless or unincidented, part of the story \"ends in a\r\nblow-up,\" or rather in a sink-down, for Anzoleto, on a stolen gondola\r\ntrip with Clorinda, third cantatrice and interim mistress of Zustiniani\r\n(beautiful, but stupid, and a bad singer), meets the Count in another\r\ngondola with Corilla herself, and in his fury rams his rival and the\r\nperfidious one. Consuelo, who has at last had her eyes opened, quits\r\nVenice and flees, with a testimonial from Porpora, to Germany. Even then\r\none hopes for the best, and acknowledges that at any rate something not\r\nfar from the best, something really good, has been given one for two\r\nhundred well-filled pages--more than the equivalent of the first deck of\r\none of our old average \"three-deckers.\"\r\n\r\nBut in the mind of experience such hopes are always accompanied by\r\nfears, and alas! in this instance \"the fears have it.\" There is on the\r\nborder of Bohemia a \"Castle of the Giants\"; and oh! how one wishes that\r\nmy Uncle Toby had allowed the sea to execute the ravages he deprecated\r\nand sweep that castle into nothingness! When we get there Byronism is\r\nback--nay, its papa and mamma, Lewisism and Radcliffism, are back\r\nalso--with their cardboard turrets and precipices and grottos; their\r\npine-woods reminding one of the little bristly green things, on round\r\ncinnamon-coloured bases, of one's youth; their floods and falls so\r\nobviously supplied at so much a thousand gallons by the nearest water\r\ncompany, and their mystery-men and dwarfs and catalepsies and all the\r\nrest of the weary old \"tremblement.\" Count Christian of Rudolstadt is\r\nindeed a gentleman and an almost too affectionate father; his brother,\r\nBaron Frederick, a not disagreeable sportsman and _bon vivant_; their\r\nsister, the Canoness, a not too theatrical old maid; and Frederick's\r\ndaughter, Amélie, though pert and not too good-natured, the most human\r\ncreature of them all, albeit with the humanities of a soubrette rather\r\nthan of a great lady. But what shall one say of Albert of Rudolstadt,\r\nthe heir, the betrothed of Amélie (this fact excusing much in her), and,\r\nwhen Consuelo has joined the circle at Porpora's recommendation as\r\nmusic-mistress and companion in the higher kind to Amélie--_her_ slave,\r\nconqueror, tormentor, and in the long-run husband? He is perhaps the\r\nmost intolerable hero[181] ever designed as a gentleman by a novelist\r\nwho has been classed as great, and who certainly has some qualities\r\nnecessary to greatness. In reading about him vague compunctions even\r\ncome over the mind at having spoken harshly of Sténio and Trenmor.\r\nSténio was always a fool and latterly a cad; Trenmor first a brute and\r\nthen a bore. Albert is none of these (except perhaps the last), but he\r\nis madder than the Mad Hatter and the March Hare put together, and as\r\ndepressing as they are delightful. He has hallucinations which\r\nobliterate the sense of time in him; he thinks himself one of his\r\nancestors of the days of Ziska; he has second sight; he speaks Spanish\r\nto Consuelo and calls her by her name when he first sees her, though he\r\nhas not the faintest _sane_ idea who she is or whence she comes; and he\r\nreduces his family to abject misery by ensconcing himself for days in a\r\ngrotto which can be isolated by means of a torrent turned on and off at\r\npleasure by a dwarf gipsy called Zdenko, who is almost a greater\r\nnuisance than Albert himself. Consuelo discovers his retreat at the risk\r\nof being drowned; and various nightmarish scenes occur, resulting in the\r\nslight return to sanity on Albert's part involved in falling in love\r\nwith her, and a very considerable advance towards _in_sanity on hers by\r\nfalling in love with him. But perhaps this give-and-take of lovers may\r\nseem attractive to some. And when after a time we get into mere\r\nhocus-pocus, and it seems to Consuelo that Albert's violin \"speaks and\r\nutters words as through the mouth of Satan,\" the same persons may think\r\nit fine. For myself, I believe that without fatuity I may claim to be,\r\nif not a _visionnaire_ (perhaps that also), at least a lover of visions,\r\nand of Isaiah and Ezekiel and the Revelation. Dante, Blake, Shelley, the\r\nbest of Lamennais and the best of Hugo excite in me nothing but a\r\npassionate reverence. I can walk day-long and night-long by Ulai and\r\nChebar and Lethe-Eunoe and have no thought of sneer or slumber, shrug or\r\nsatiety. But when you ask me to be agitated at Count Albert of\r\nRudolstadt's violin ventriloquising Satan I really must decline. I do\r\neven remember the poor creature Paul de Kock, and would fain turn to one\r\nof the things he was writing at this very time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recovery; but not maintained quite to the end.]\r\n\r\n_Consuelo_ is a very long book--it fills three of the tightly printed\r\nvolumes of the old Michel-Calmann-Lévy collection, with some three or\r\nfour hundred pages in each; and we have not got, in the above survey, to\r\nmore than the middle of the second. But in its afternoon and evening\r\nthere is some light. The creature Anzoleto recurs; but his immediate\r\neffect is good,[182] for it starts the heroine on a fresh elopement of\r\nan innocent kind, and we get back to reality. The better side of George\r\nSand's Bohemianism revives in Bohemia itself; and she takes Consuelo to\r\nthe road, where she adopts male dress (a fancy with her creatress\r\nlikewise), and falls in with no less a person than the composer Haydn in\r\nhis youth. They meet some Prussian crimps, and escape them by help of a\r\ncoxcombical but not wholly objectionable Austrian Count Hoditz and the\r\nbetter (Prussian) Trenck. They get to Vienna (meeting La Corilla in an\r\nodd but not badly managed maternity-scene half-way) and rejoin old\r\nPorpora there. There are interviews with Kaunitz and Maria Theresa:[183]\r\nand a recrudescence of the Venetian musical jealousies. Consuelo\r\nendeavours to reopen communications with the Rudolstadts, but\r\nPorpora--chiefly out of his desire to retain her on the stage, but\r\npartly also from an honest and not wholly unsound belief that a union\r\nbetween a gipsy girl and a German noble would itself be madness--plays\r\nfalse with the letters. She accepts a professional invitation from\r\nHoditz to his castle in Moravia, meets there no less a person than\r\nFrederic the Second _incognito_, and by his order (after she has saved\r\nhis life from the vengeance of the re-crimped deserter rescued with her\r\nby Hoditz and Trenck) is invited to sing at Berlin. The carrying out of\r\nthe invitation, which has its Fredericianities[184] (as one may perhaps\r\nbe allowed to call them), is, however, interrupted. The mysterious\r\nAlbert, who has mysteriously turned up in time to prevent an attempt of\r\nthe other and worse (Austrian) Trenck on Consuelo, is taken with an\r\napparently mortal illness at home, and Consuelo is implored to return\r\nthere. She does so, and a marriage _in articulo mortis_ follows, the\r\nsupposed dead Zdenko (whom we did not at all want) turning up alive\r\nafter his master's death. Consuelo, fully if not cheerfully adopted by\r\nthe family, is offered all the heirloom jewels and promised succession\r\nto the estates. She refuses, and the book ends--with fair warning that\r\nit is no ending.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Comtesse de Rudolstadt._]\r\n\r\nWhen her history begins again under the title she has \"reneged,\" the\r\nreader may for no short time think that the curse of the sequel--a curse\r\nonly too common, but not universal--is going to be averted. She is in\r\nBerlin alone (see note above); is successful, but not at all\r\nhappy--perhaps least of all happy because the king, partly out of\r\ngratitude for his safety, partly out of something like a more natural\r\nkind of affection than most authors have credited him with, pays her\r\nmarked attentions. For a time things are not unlively; and even the very\r\ndangerous experiment of a supper--one of those at which Frederic's\r\nguests were supposed to have perfectly \"free elbows\" and availed\r\nthemselves of the supposition at their peril--a supper with Voltaire, La\r\nMettrie, Algarotti, D'Argens, Pöllnitz, and \"Quintus Icilius\"\r\npresent--comes off not so badly. One of the reasons of this is that\r\nGeorge Sand has the sense to make Voltaire ill and silent, and puts the\r\nbulk of the \"business\" on La Mettrie--a person much cleverer than most\r\npeople who have only read book-notices of him may think, but not\r\ndangerously brilliant. Then Consuelo, or \"La Porporina,\" as her stage\r\nname is, gets mixed up--owing to no fault of her own in the first place\r\nat any rate--with the intrigues of the Princess Amélie of Prussia and\r\nher lover, the less bad Trenck. This has two awkward results--for\r\nherself an imprisonment at Spandau, into which she is cast by Frederic's\r\nhalf jealous, half purely tyrannical wrath, and for us a revival of all\r\nthe _massacrant_ illuminism in which the Princess herself is dabbling.\r\nSo we have on the scene not only (as the reader sees at once, though\r\nsome rather clumsy efforts are made to hide it) the resuscitated Albert,\r\nwho passes as a certain Trismegistus, not only the historical charlatan\r\nSaint-Germain, but another charlatan at this time not at all historical\r\n(seeing that the whole story ends in 1760, and he never left Palermo\r\ntill nine years later), Cagliostro. Even at Spandau Consuelo herself is\r\nnot quite uninteresting; but the Illuminati determine to rescue her, and\r\nfor the latter part of the first volume and the whole of the second the\r\nentire thing is, once more, Bosh. The most absurd \"double-gangings\" take\r\nplace between an _inconnu_ named Liverani, whom Consuelo cannot help\r\nloving, and Albert himself, who _is_ Liverani, as everybody but herself\r\nsees at once, interspersed between endless tracts of the usual rubbish\r\nabout underground tribunals, and judges in red cloaks, and skeletons,\r\nand museums of torture-implements, and all the Weishauptian trumpery of\r\nmixed occultism and revolutionary sentiment. The author has even the\r\ninsufferable audacity to fling at us _another_ resuscitation--that of\r\nthe Countess Wanda, Albert's mother, who appears to have transmitted to\r\nhim her abominable habit of catalepsy. So ends, unsatisfactorily\r\nenough--unless anybody is satisfied by the fact that two solid children\r\nresult from the still mystifying married life of the pair--the story\r\nwhich had begun so well in the first volume of _Consuelo_, and which in\r\nthe major part of _Consuelo_ itself, though not throughout, maintains\r\nthe satisfaction fairly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"making good\" of _Lucrezia Floriani_.]\r\n\r\nIf any reader, in two ways gentle, has been good enough to take some\r\ninterest in the analysis of these books, but is also so soft-hearted as\r\nto feel slightly _froissé_ by it, as showing a disqualifying inability\r\nto sympathise with the author, I hope I may put myself right by what I\r\nam going to say of another. _Lucrezia Floriani_ is to me the most\r\nremarkable book that George Sand ever wrote; and the nearest to a great\r\none, if it be not actually that. I have read it, with no diminution of\r\ninterest and no abatement of esteem, at very different times of my life,\r\nand I think that it is on the whole not only the most perfect revelation\r\nof what at any rate the author would have liked to be her own\r\ntemperament, but--a much greater thing--a presentment in possible and\r\nhuman form of a real temperament, and almost of a real character.\r\nFurther, it is much the most achieved example of that peculiar style of\r\nwhich more will be said in a general way presently, and it contains\r\ncomparatively few blots. One always smiles, of course, at the picture of\r\nLucrezia swinging in a hammock in the centre of a large room, the four\r\ncorners of which are occupied by four bedsteads containing four\r\nchildren, in the production of whom not exactly _four_ fathers, as they\r\nought for perfect symmetry, but as a compromise _three_, have assisted.\r\nOne always shudders at her notion of restoring a patient, suffering\r\nunder a nervous ailment, by surrounding his couch with the cherubic\r\ncountenances and the balmy breaths of these infants.[185] Prince Karol,\r\nthe hero (such as there is), is a poor creature, though not such a cad\r\nas Sténio; but then, according to Madame Dudevant, men as a rule _were_\r\npoor creatures, unless they were convicts or conjurors, so the\r\npresentation is _ex hypothesi_ or _secundum hypothesin_ correct. And the\r\nwhole is firmly drawn and well, but neither gaudily nor pitchily,\r\ncoloured. It ought to be remembered that, with the possible exception of\r\nJane Austen, who has no peer or second among lady novelists, these\r\neither confine themselves to representation of manners, external\r\ncharacter, _ton_, as was said of Fanny Burney, or else, like the other\r\n\"George\" and Charlotte Brontë, endeavour to represent themselves as they\r\nare or as they would like to be on the canvas. They never create; if\r\nthey \"imitate\" not in the degraded modern but the original classical\r\nsense, and do it well, _punctum ferunt_--_suum_ if not _omne_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The story.]\r\n\r\n_Lucrezia Floriani_ does this higher imitation well--almost, if not\r\nquite, greatly. Had George Sand been more of a blue-stocking and of an\r\naffected creature than she was, she might have called the book\r\n_Anteros-Nemesis_. The heroine, by her real name Antonietta Menapace, is\r\nthe daughter of a fisherman on the Lago d'Iseo, and in her earliest\r\ngirlhood the servant-maid of a rich neighbour's wife. As her father, a\r\nclose-fisted peasant, wants her to marry a well-to-do churl of her own\r\nrank, she elopes with her employer's son and has two children by him;\r\nbut develops a magnificent voice, with no small acting and managing\r\ncapacity. So she makes a fortune by the time she is thirty, acquiring\r\nthe two other children by two other lovers, and having so many more who\r\ndo not leave permanent memorials of their love and necessitate polygonal\r\nrooms, that, as she observes, \"she cannot count them.\"[186] At the\r\nabove-mentioned age, however, she becomes weary of this sort of life,\r\nretires to her native district, buys the very house in which she had\r\nbeen a servant, and with the heir of which (now dead) she had eloped,\r\nand settles down to be a model mother, a Lady Bountiful, and a sort of\r\nrecluse. No more \"love\" for her. In fact, in one of the most remarkable\r\npassages of the book she gives a story of her chief attachments, showing\r\nthat, with brief accesses of physical excitement, it has always been\r\n_amour de tête_ and never _amour de coeur_.\r\n\r\nThings being so, there arrive one evening, at the only inn on the lake,\r\na young German Prince, Karol von Roswald, and his friend the Italian\r\nCount Salvator Albani. They are travelling for the Prince's health, he\r\nbeing a sort of spoilt child, pitiably nervous, imperfectly educated,\r\nand half paralysed by the recent death of his mother and the earlier one\r\nof a _fiancée_. The inn is good to eat in (or rather out of), but for\r\nnothing else; and Salvator, hearing of Lucrezia, whose friend, though\r\nnot her lover, he has formerly been, determines to ask a hospitality\r\nwhich she very cheerfully gives them. _Cetera quis nescit_, as George\r\nSand herself in other but often-repeated words admits.[187] Karol falls\r\nin love at first sight, though he is horrified at his hostess's past. He\r\nalso falls ill, and she nurses him. Salvator leaves them for a time,\r\nand though Lucrezia plays quite the reverse of the part of temptress,\r\nthe inevitable does not fail to happen.\r\n\r\nThat they were _not_ married and that they did _not_ live happy ever\r\nafter, everybody will of course be certain, though it is not Karol's\r\nfault that actual marriage does not take place. There is, however, an\r\nalmost literal, if unsanctified and irregular honeymoon; but long before\r\nSalvator's[188] return, it has \"reddened\" more than ominously. Karol is\r\ninsanely jealous, and it may be admitted that a more manly and less\r\nchildishly selfish creature might be somewhat upset by the arrival of\r\nLucrezia's last lover, the father of her youngest child, though it is\r\nquite evident that she has not a spark of love for this one left. But he\r\nis also jealous of Salvator; of an old artist named Beccaferri whom she\r\nassists; of a bagman who calls to sell to her eldest boy a gun; of the\r\naged peasant whom she had refused to marry, but whose death-bed she\r\nvisits; of the _curé_; of everybody. And his jealousy takes the form not\r\nmerely of rage, which is bad enough for Lucrezia's desire of peace, but\r\nof cold insult, which revolts her never extinguished independence and\r\npride. He has, as noted, begged her to marry him in the time of\r\nintoxication, but she has refused, and persists in the refusal. After\r\none or two \"scenes\" she rows herself over to an olive wood on the other\r\nside of the lake, and makes it a kind of \"place of sacrifice\"--of the\r\nsacrifice, that is to say, of all hopes of happiness with him or any one\r\nthenceforward. But she neither dismisses nor leaves him; on the\r\ncontrary, they live together, unmarried, but with no public scandal, for\r\nten years, his own passion for her in its peculiar kind never ceasing,\r\nwhile hers gradually dies under the stress of the various torments he\r\ninflicts, unintentionally if not quite unconsciously, upon her. At last\r\nit is too much, and she dies of heart-failure at forty years of age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its balance of power.]\r\n\r\nOne might make a few cavils at this. The exact reason of what has been\r\ncalled the \"sacrifice\" is not made clear, despite Lucrezia's soliloquy\r\nin the olive wood. If it were meant as an atonement for her ill-spent\r\nyouth it would be intelligible. But there is no sign of this, and it\r\nwould not be in George Sand's way. Lucrezia merely resolves that she\r\nwill try to make everybody happy without trying or expecting to be happy\r\nherself. But she must know more and more that she is _not_ making Karol\r\nhappy, and that the cohabitation cannot, even in Italy, but be\r\nprejudicial to her children; though, to do him the very scanty justice\r\nhe deserves, he does not behave ill to them, little as he likes them.\r\n\r\nAgain, this long self-martyrdom would need no explanation if she\r\ncontinued to love Karol. But it is very doubtful whether she had not\r\nceased to do so (she was admittedly good at \"ceasing to love\") when she\r\nleft the Wood of Olives, and the cessation admittedly took place long\r\nbefore the ten years' torture came to an end. One is therefore,\r\nfrom more than one point of view, left with a sort of Fakir\r\nself-mortification, undertaken and \"dreed\" neither to atone for\r\nanything, nor to propitiate any Power, nor really to benefit any man.\r\nAfter all, however, such a thing is quite humanly possible. And these\r\n_aporiae_ hardly touch knots--only very small spots--in a reed of\r\nadmirable strength and beauty. We know that George Sand did _not_\r\nsacrifice herself for her lovers--very much the reverse. But we know\r\nalso that in her youth and early middle age she was very much of a\r\nLucrezia Floriani, something of a genius, if not so great a one as she\r\nmade her creature, something of a beauty, entirely negligent of ordinary\r\nsexual morality, but thoroughly, if somewhat heartlessly, good-natured,\r\nand (not merely at the times mentioned, but to the end of her life) an\r\naffectionate mother, a delightful hostess, and a very satisfactory\r\nfriend. No imaginary Sténio or Karol, no actual Sandeau or Musset or\r\nChopin could have caused her at any time of her life the misery which\r\nthe Prince caused Lucrezia, because she would simply have \"sent him\r\nwalking,\" as the vigorous French idiom has it. But it pleased her to\r\ngraft upon her actual nature something else that it lacked, and a\r\nlife-like and tragical story resulted.\r\n\r\nIt is not a bad \"turn over of the leaf\" from this, the strongest, and in\r\nthe best sense most faultless, of George Sand's novels of analysis, to\r\nthe \"idyllic\" group of her later middle and later period--the\r\n\"prettiest\" division, and in another grade of faultlessness the most\r\nfree from faults, in ordinary estimation, of her entire production.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Idylls\"--_La Petite Fadette_.]\r\n\r\nThe most popular of these, the prettiest again, the most of a\r\n_bergerie-berquinade-conte-de-fées_, is no doubt _La Petite Fadette_,\r\nthe history of two twin-boys and a little girl--this last, of course,\r\nthe heroine. The boys are devoted to each other and as like as two peas\r\nin person, but very different in character, one being manly, and the\r\nother, if not exactly effeminate, something like it. As for Fadette,\r\nshe, though never exactly like the other girl of the saying \"horrid,\"\r\nbut only (and with very considerable excuses) naughty and untidy and\r\nrude, becomes \"so very, very good when she is good\" as to awake slight\r\nrecalcitrances in those who have acquired the questionable knowledge of\r\ngood and evil in actual life. But one does not want to cavil. It _is_ a\r\npretty book, and when the not exactly wicked but somewhat ill-famed\r\ngrandmother's stocking yields several thousand francs and facilitates\r\nthe marriage of Landry, the manly brother, and Fadette, one can be very\r\ncheerfully cheerful, and anticipate a real ever-after happiness for\r\nboth. No doubt, too, the army did knock the girlishness out of the other\r\nbrother, Sylvinet, and we hope that one of the village gossips was wrong\r\nwhen she said that he would never love any girl but one. For it is\r\nhardly necessary to say that his agreement with his twin extends to love\r\nfor Fadette--love which is quite honourable, and quite kindly\r\nextinguished by that agreeable materialisation of one of Titania's\r\nlower-class maids-of-honour.\r\n\r\nOnly one slight piece of _malice_ (in the mitigated French sense) may be\r\npermitted. We are told that Sylvinet, after the marriage, served for ten\r\nyears \"in the Emperor Napoleon's glorious campaigns.\" This will hardly\r\nadmit of a later date for that marriage itself than the breach of the\r\nPeace of Amiens. And this, even if Landry was no more than eighteen or\r\nnineteen at that time (he could hardly be less), will throw the date of\r\nhis and his brother's birth well before the Revolution. Now, to insist\r\non chronological exactitude and draw inferences from its absence is--one\r\nadmits most cheerfully, and more than admits--a mere curmudgeonly\r\npedantry in most cases of great or good fiction, prose or verse. One\r\nknows what to think of people who make crimes of these things in\r\nShakespeare or Scott, in Dumas or Thackeray. But when a writer makes a\r\ngreat point of Purpose and sets a high value on Questions, it is not\r\nunfair to expect him or her to mind their P's and Q's in other matters.\r\nGeorge Sand is never tired, in other books, of insisting on the\r\nblessedness of the Revolution itself, on the immense and glorious\r\nemancipation from feudal tyranny, etc. But how does it come about that\r\nthere is not the very slightest sign of that tyranny in the earlier part\r\nof the story, or of any general disturbance in the middle and later\r\npart? _Glissons; n'appuyons pas_ on this point, but it may be permitted\r\nto put it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Mare au Diable._]\r\n\r\nIn another book of this group--I think chronologically the earliest,\r\nalso very popular, and quite \"on the side of the angels\"--the heroine,\r\nanother divine little peasant-girl--who, if George Sand had been fond of\r\nseries-titles, might have caused the book to be named _La Petite\r\nMarie_--omits any, however slightly, \"horrid\" stage altogether. She is,\r\nif not \"the whole\" good--which, as Empedocles said long ago, few can\r\nboast to find,--good, and nothing but good, except pretty, and other\r\nthings which are parts or forms of goodness. The piece really is, in the\r\nproper sense which so few people know, or at least use, an idyll, a\r\nlittle picture of Arcadian life. Speaking precisely--that is to say in\r\n_précis_--it is nothing but the story of a journey in which the\r\ntravellers get benighted, and which ends in a marriage. Speaking\r\nanalytically, it consists of a prologue--one of the best examples of\r\nGeorge Sand's style and of her power of description, dealing with the\r\nploughlands of Berry and the ways of their population; of the\r\nproposition to a young widower that he shall undertake re-marriage with\r\na young widow, well-to-do, of another parish; of his going a-wooing with\r\nthe rather incongruous adjuncts of a pretty young servant girl, who is\r\ngoing to a \"place,\" and his own truant elder sonlet; of the benighting\r\nof them as above by the side of a mere or marsh of evil repute; of the\r\ninsult offered to Marie on the arrival at her new place; of the\r\ndiscomfiture of Germain, the hero, at finding that the young widow keeps\r\na sort of court of pretenders dangling about her; of his retirement and\r\nvengeance on Marie's insulter; and of the proper marriage-bells. There\r\nis also a rather unnecessary appendix, doubtless dear to the folklorist,\r\nof Berrichon wedding customs.\r\n\r\nOnce more, to cavil at this would be contemptibly easy. To quote _La\r\nTerre_ against it would be uncritical, for, as may be seen later,\r\nwhatever M. Zola's books are, they are not evidence that can negative\r\nanything. It would be as sensible to set against the night scene in the\r\nwood by the Devil's Pool the history of the amiable Dumollard, who, as\r\nfar as fifty years' memory serves me, used, some years before George\r\nSand's death, sometimes to escort and sometimes to lie in wait for\r\nservant-girls on the way to or from places, violate, murder, and rob\r\nthem, in another country district of France. Nor would it be quite\r\ncritical, though a little more so, to compare George Sand's own friend,\r\ncontemporary, and in some sort counterpart, Balzac's peasant scenes\r\nagainst her. If, at this time, she viewed all such things _en rose_,\r\nBalzac viewed them, at this and almost all times, _en noir_. Perhaps\r\neverybody (except the wicked farmer, who insults Marie) is a little too\r\ngood, and it seems rather surprising that somebody did not say something\r\nabout Germain and Marie arriving next morning instead of overnight. But\r\nnever mind this. The scenery and the writing of the book have real\r\ncharm. The long conversation by the watch-fire in the wood, where\r\nGermain tries to break off his suit to the widow already and transfer\r\nhimself to Marie, with Marie's cool and (for she has loved him already)\r\nself-denying refusal on the most atrociously rational and business-like\r\nprinciples, is first-rate. It may rank, with the above-mentioned\r\ndiscussion about Consuelo's beauty between herself and her lover, as one\r\nof the best examples of George Sand's gift for the novel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _François le Champi._]\r\n\r\nThe third in the order of mention of what is usually considered her\r\ntrilogy of idylls, _François le Champi_, if not the prettiest, is the\r\nstrongest, and the most varied in interest, of the three. The shadier\r\nside of human character lifts itself and says, _Et in Arcadia ego_,[189]\r\nmuch more decidedly than in the childish petulances of _La Petite\r\nFadette_ and the merely \"Third Murderer\" appearance of the unprincipled\r\nfarmer in _La Mare au Diable_. Even the mostly blameless hero is\r\nallowed, towards the close, to exhibit the well-known _rusé_ or _madré_\r\ncharacteristics of the French peasant to the extent of more than one not\r\nquite white lie; the husband of the heroine is unfaithful, tyrannical as\r\nfar as he dare be, and a waster of his family's goods before his\r\nfortunately rather early death; his pretty young sister, Mariette, is a\r\nselfish and spiteful minx; and his paramour (sarcastically named \"La\r\nSevère\") is unchaste, malignant, and dishonest all at once--a\r\ncombination which may be said to exclude any possible goodness in woman.\r\n\r\nThe only thoroughly white sheep--though the \"Champi\" or foundling (his\r\ncradle being the genial fields and not the steps of stone) has but the\r\ngrey patches noticed above, and those acquired with the best\r\nintentions--is Madeleine Blanchet, his protectress for many years, and\r\nfinally, after difficulties and her widowhood, his wife. That she is\r\nsome twelve years older than he is is a detail which need not in itself\r\nbe of much importance. It lends itself to that combination of maternal\r\nand sexual affection of which George Sand is so fond, and of which we\r\nmay have to speak some harsh words elsewhere. But here it matters\r\nlittle. Arcady is a kind of Saturnian realm, and \"mixtures\" elsewhere\r\n\"held a stain\" may pass there.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Others--_Mauprat_.]\r\n\r\nWe may make a further _glissade_ (to return to some remarks made above),\r\nthough of a different kind, over a few of the very large number of\r\nnovels that we cannot discuss in detail. But _Mauprat_ adds just a\r\nlittle support to the remarks there made. For this (which is a sort of\r\ncrime-and-detection novel, and therefore appeals to some readers more\r\nthan to the present historian) turns wholly on the atrocious deeds of a\r\nseignorial family of the most melodramatic kind. Yet it is questionable\r\nwhether the wickedest of them ever did anything worse than the action of\r\ntheir last and renegade member, who actually, when he comes into the\r\nproperty, ruins his ancestral castle because naughty things have been\r\ndone there. Now, when Milton said, \"As well kill a man as kill a good\r\nbook,\" though it was no doubt an intentional hyperbole, there was much\r\nsound sense in what he said. Still, except in the case of such a book as\r\nhas been produced only a few times in the world's history, it may be\r\nurged that probably something as good might be written by somebody else\r\namong the numerous men that were not killed. But, on the same principle,\r\none would be justified in saying, \"Better kill a hundred men than ruin a\r\ncastle with hundreds of years of memories, bad or good.\" You can never\r\nreplace _it_, while the hundred men will, at the very moment they are\r\nkilled, be replaced, just as good on the average, by the ordinary\r\noperations of nature. Besides, by partially ruining the castle, you give\r\nan opening to the sin of the restorer, for which there is, we know, _no_\r\npardon, here or hereafter.[190]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Daniella._]\r\n\r\n_La Daniella_ is a rather long book and a rather dull one. There is a\r\ngood deal of talkee-talkee of the _Corinne_ kind in it: the heroine is\r\nan angelic Italian soubrette; the hero is one of the coxcombish heroes\r\nof French novels, who seem to have set themselves to confirm the most\r\nunjust ideas of their nation entertained in foreign climes; there is a\r\n\"Miss Medora,\" who, as the hero informs us, \"plays the coquette\r\nclumsily, as English girls generally do,\" etc. _Passons outre_, without\r\ninquiring how much George Sand knew about English girls.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Les Beaux Messieurs de Bois-Doré._]\r\n\r\nOne of the best of her books to read, though it has neither the human\r\ninterest of _Lucrezia Floriani_, nor the prettiness of the Idylls, nor\r\nthe style-colour of some other books, is _Les Beaux Messieurs de\r\nBois-Doré_. It is all the more agreeable that we may even \"begin with a\r\nlittle aversion.\" It suggests itself as a sort of interloper in the\r\ngreat business of Dumas and Co.: it opens, indeed, only a few years\r\nbefore D'Artagnan rode up to the inn on the buttercup-coloured pony.\r\nAnd, in manner, it may look at first as if the writer were following\r\nanother but much inferior example--our own G. P. R. James; for there are\r\n\"two cavaliers,\" and one tells the other a tale fit to make him fall\r\nasleep and off his saddle. But it improves remarkably, and before you\r\nhave read a hundred pages you are very fairly \"enfisted.\" The figure of\r\nthe old Marquis de Bois-Doré--an aged dandy with divers absurdities\r\nabout him,[191] but a gentleman to his by no means yet stiffened or\r\nstooping backbone; a heart of gold, and a wrist with a good core of\r\nsteel left in it--might easily have been a failure. It is a success. His\r\nfirst guest and then adversary, the wicked Spaniard, Sciarra d'Alvimar\r\nor de Villareal, whom the old marquis runs through the body in a\r\nmoonlight duel for very sufficient reason,[192] may not be thought quite\r\nequally successful. Scoundrel as he is, George Sand has unwisely thrown\r\nover him a touch of _guignon_--of shadowing and resistless fate--which\r\ncreates a certain sympathy; and she neglects the good old rule that your\r\nvillain should always be allowed a certain run for his money--a\r\ntemporary exercise of his villainy. Alvimar, though he does not feel the\r\nmarquis's rapier till nearly the end of the first half, as it were, of\r\nthe book, is \"marked down\" from the start, and never kills anything\r\nwithin those limits except a poor little tame wolf-cub which is going\r\n(very sensibly) to fly at him. He is altogether too much in appearance\r\nand too little in effectuality of the stage Spaniard--black garments,\r\nblack upturned moustache, hook-nose, _navaja_, and all the rest of it.\r\nBut he does not spoil the thing, though he hardly does it much good; and\r\nif he is badly treated he has his revenge on the author.\r\n\r\nFor the book becomes very dull after his supposed death (he _does_ die,\r\nbut not at once), and only revives when, some way into the second\r\nvolume, an elaborate attempt to revenge him is made by his servant,\r\nSanche, _âme damnée_ and also _damnante_ (if one may coin this variant),\r\nwho is, as it turns out, his irregular father. This again rather stagy\r\ncharacter organises a formidable body of wandering _reîtres_, gipsies,\r\nand miscellaneous ruffians to attack and sack the marquis's house--a\r\nplan which, though ultimately foiled, brings about a very refreshing\r\nseries of hurly-burlys and hullabaloos for some hundred and fifty pages.\r\nThe narrative is full of improbable impossibilities, and contrasts\r\nsingularly with the fashion in which Dumas, throughout all his great\r\nbooks (and not a few of his not so great ones), manages to _escamoter_\r\nthe difficulty. The boy Mario,[193] orphan of the murdered brother, left\r\nunknown for many years, recognised by his uncle, avenger of his father\r\non Sanche, as Bois-Doré himself had been on Alvimar, is altogether too\r\nclever and effective for his age; and the conduct of Bellinde,\r\nBois-Doré's cashiered _gouvernante_, is almost preposterous throughout.\r\nBut it is what a schoolboy of the old days would have called a \"jolly\r\ngood scrimmage,\" and restores the interest of the book for most of the\r\nsecond volume. The end--scarcely, one would think, very interesting to\r\nany one--is quite spoilt for some by another example of George Sand's\r\ninveterate passion for \"maternal\" love-making and matches where the lady\r\nis nearly double the age of her husband. Others--or the same--may not be\r\npropitiated for this by the \"horrors\"[194] which the author has\r\nliberally thrown in. But the larger part of the book, like the larger\r\npart of _Consuelo_, is quite good stuff.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Marquis de Villemer._]\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, a really lively book. Two duller ones than the first two\r\nallotted, at the beginning of this notice, to her last period I have\r\nseldom read. They are both instances (and one at least contains an\r\nelaborate vindication) of the \"novel of purpose,\" and they are by\r\nthemselves almost enough to damn it. M. le Marquis de Villemer is an\r\nappalling prig--virtuous, in the Devil-and-his-grandmother style, to the\r\n_n_th--who devotes his energies to writing a _History of the Patriciate\r\nsince the Christian Era_, the object being to reveal the sins of\r\naristocracy. He has a rather nice half-brother spend-thrift, Duque\r\nd'Aleria (Madame de Villemer the elder has first married a Spaniard),\r\nwhose debts he virtuously pays, and after a great deal of scandal he\r\nmarries a poor but noble and noble-minded damsel, Caroline de\r\nSaint-Geneix, who has taken the position of companion to his mother in\r\norder to help her widowed and four-childed sister. For the virtue of\r\nGeorge Sand's virtuous people _is_ virtue and no mistake. The lively and\r\namiable duke is fortunately fitted with a lively and amiable duchess,\r\nand they show a little light in the darkness of copy-book morality and\r\nrepublican principles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mlle. La Quintinie._]\r\n\r\nThis kindly light is altogether wanting in _Mademoiselle La Quintinie_,\r\nwhere the purpose passes from politics to religion. The book is rather\r\nfamous, and was, at the time, much read, because it is not merely a\r\nnovel of purpose, but an instance of the duello fought, not with sword\r\nor pistol, not with quarter-staves or sand-bags, but with _feuilletons_\r\nof fiction. It, and Octave Feuillet's _Sibylle_, to which it is the\r\ncountercheck-quarrelsome, both appeared in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_.\r\nIt should be seen at a further stage of this volume that I do not think\r\n_Sibylle_ a masterpiece, either of tale-telling or of argumentation,\r\nthough it is more on my side than the reply is. But Feuillet, though not\r\na genius, as some people would have George Sand to be, nor yet\r\npossessing anything like the talent which no sane criticism can deny\r\nher, was a much better craftsman in the art of novel-writing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Flamarande._]\r\n\r\nFor a final notice--dealing also with the last, or almost the last, of\r\nall her books--we may take _Flamarande_ and its sequel, _Les Deux\r\nFrères_. They give the history of the unfounded jealousy of a husband in\r\nregard to his wife--a jealousy which is backed up by an equally\r\nunfounded suspicion (supported by the most outrageous proceedings of\r\nespionage and something like burglary) on the part of a confidential\r\nservant, who, as we are informed at last, has himself had a secret\r\npassion for his innocent mistress. It is more like a Feuillet book than\r\na George Sand, and in this respect shows the curious faculty--possessed\r\nalso by some lady novelists of our own--of adapting itself to the change\r\nof novel-fashion. But to me at least it appeals not.\r\n\r\nSo turn we from particulars (for individual notice of the hundred books\r\nis impossible) to generals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary and judgment.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Style.]\r\n\r\nIt may be difficult to sum up the characteristics of such a writer as\r\nGeorge Sand shortly, but it has to be done. There is to be allowed\r\nher--of course and at once--an extraordinary fertility, and a hardly\r\nless extraordinary escape from absolute sinking into the trivial. She is\r\npreposterous early, somewhat facile and \"journalistic\" later, but she is\r\nnever exactly commonplace. She belongs to the school of immense and\r\nalmost mechanical producers who are represented in English by Anthony\r\nTrollope as their \"prior\" and by Mrs. Oliphant[195] and Miss Braddon as\r\ncommandresses of the order. (I think she runs a good deal below the\r\nPrior but a good deal above the Commandresses.[196]) But, if she does so\r\nbelong, it is very mainly due, not to any pre-eminence of narrative\r\nfaculty, but to that gift of style which has been for nearly a hundred\r\nyears admitted. Now I have in this _History_ more than once, and by no\r\nmeans with tongue in cheek, expressed a diffidence about giving opinions\r\non this point. I have, it is true, read French for more than sixty\r\nyears, and I have been accustomed to \"read for style\" in it, and in\r\ndivers other languages, for at least fifty. But I see such extraordinary\r\nblunders made by foreigners in regard to this side of our own\r\nliterature, that I can never be sure--being less conceited than the\r\npious originator of the phrase--that even the Grace of God has prevented\r\nme from going the same way. Still, if I have any right to publish this\r\nbook, I must have a little--I will not say \"right,\" but _venia_ or\r\nlicence--to say what seems to me to be the fact of the matter. That\r\nfact--or that seeming of fact--is that George Sand's style is _too_\r\nfacile to be first-rate. By this I do not mean that it is too plain. On\r\nthe contrary, it is sometimes, especially in her early books, ornate to\r\ngorgeousness, and even to gaudiness. And it was a curious mistake of the\r\nlate Mr. Pater, in a quite honorific reference to me, to imply that I\r\npreferred the plain style--a mistake all the more curious that he knew\r\nand acknowledged (and was almost unduly grateful for) my admiration of\r\nhis own. I like both forms: but for style--putting meaning out of the\r\nquestion--I would rather read Browne than Swift, and Lamennais than\r\nFénelon.\r\n\r\nGeorge Sand has both the plain and the ornate styles (and various shades\r\nof \"middle\" between them) at command. But it seems to me that she has\r\nthem--to use a financial phrase recently familiar--too much \"on tap.\"\r\nYou see that the current of agreeable and, so to speak, faultless\r\nlanguage is running, and might run volubly for any period of life that\r\nmight be allotted to her. In fact it did so. Now no doubt there was\r\nsomething of Edmond de Goncourt's bad-blooded fatuity in his claim that\r\nhis and his brother's epithets were \"personal,\" while Flaubert's were\r\nnot. Research for more personal \"out-of-the-wayness\" in style will\r\nrarely result in anything but jargon. But, on the other hand, Gautier's\r\ngreat injunction:\r\n\r\n    Sculpte, lime, cisèle!\r\n\r\nis sound. You cannot reach the first class in any art by turning a tap\r\nand letting it run.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conversation and description.]\r\n\r\nThe one point of what we may call the \"furniture\" of novels, in which\r\nshe seems to me to have, occasionally at least, touched supremacy, is\r\nconversation. It has been observed by those capable of making the\r\ninduction that, close as drama and novel are in some ways, the\r\ndistinction between dramatic and non-dramatic talk is, though narrow,\r\ndeeper than the very deepest Alpine crevasse from Dauphiné to Carinthia.\r\nSuch specimens as those already more than once dwelt on--Consuelo's and\r\nAnzoleto's debate about her looks, and that of Germain and Marie in the\r\nmidnight wood by the Devil's Mere--are first-rate, and there is no more\r\nto say. Some of her descriptions, again, such as the opening of the book\r\nlast quoted (the wide, treeless, communal plain with its various\r\nlabouring teams), or as some of the Lake touches in _Lucrezia Floriani_,\r\nor as the relieving patches in the otherwise monotonous grumble of _Un\r\nHiver à Majorque_, are unsurpassable. Nor is this gift limited to mere\r\n_paysage_. The famous account of Chopin's playing already mentioned for\r\npraise is only first among many. But whether these things are supported\r\nby sufficient strength of character, plot, incident, \"thought,\" and the\r\nrest; whether that strange narrative power, so hard to define and so\r\nimpossible to mistake or to fail to distinguish from these other\r\nelements, is present--these are great questions and not easy to answer.\r\nI am, as will have been seen throughout, rather inclined to answer them\r\nin the unfavourable way.\r\n\r\nIn fact--impertinent, insolent, anything else as it may seem--I venture\r\nto ask the question, \"Was George Sand a very great craftswoman in the\r\nnovel?\" and, what is more, to answer it in the negative. I understand\r\nthat an ingenious critic of her own sex has recently described her\r\nmethod as \"rolling through the book, locked in the embraces of her\r\nsubject,\" as distinguished from the aloofness and elaboration of a more\r\nrecent school. So far, perhaps, so good; but I could wish to find \"the\r\nintricacies of Diego and Julia\" more interesting to me than as a rule\r\nthey are. And it must be remembered that she is constantly detaching\r\nherself from the forlorn \"subject,\" leaving it _un_embraced and\r\nshivering, in order to sermonise it and her readers. I do not make the\r\nvery facile and somewhat futile criticism that she would have written\r\nbetter if she had written half or a quarter as much as she did. She\r\ncould not have written little; it is as natural and suitable for Tweed\r\nto \"rin wi' speed\" as for Till to \"rin slaw,\" though perhaps the\r\nresult--parallel to but more cheerful than that recorded in the old\r\nrhyme--may be that Till has the power not of drowning but of\r\nintoxicating two men, where Tweed can only manage one. But this\r\nengrained fecundity and facundity of hers inevitably make her work\r\nnovel-journalism rather than novel-literature in all points but in that\r\nof style, which has been discussed already.[197]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[174] It is attested by the well-known story, more excusable in a man\r\nthan creditable to a gentleman, of her earliest or earliest known lover,\r\nJules Sandeau (_v. inf._), seeing a photograph of her in later days,\r\nturning to a companion and saying, \"Et je l'ai connue _belle_!\"\r\n\r\n[175] It is possible that some readers may not know the delightfully\r\nunexpected, and not improbably \"more-expressive-than-volumes\" _third_\r\nline--\r\n\r\n     \"Not like the woman who lies under the next stone.\"\r\n\r\nBut tradition has, I believe, mercifully omitted to identify this\r\nneighbouring antipode.\r\n\r\n[176] Details of personal scandal seldom claim notice here. But it may\r\nbe urged with some show of reason that _this_ scandal is too closely\r\nconnected with the substance and the spirit of the novelist's whole\r\nwork, from _Indiana_ to _Flamarande_, to permit total ignoring of it.\r\n_Lucrezia Floriani_, though perhaps more suggestive of Chopin than of\r\nMusset, but with \"tangency\" on both, will be discussed in the text. That\r\nmost self-accusing of excuses, _Elle et Lui_, with its counterblast Paul\r\nde Musset's _Lui et Elle_, and a few remarks on _Un Hiver à Majorque_\r\n(conjoined for a purpose, which will be indicated) may be despatched in\r\na note of some length.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Note on _Elle et Lui_, etc.,]\r\n\r\nThe rival novel-_plaidoyers_ on the subject of the loves and strifes of\r\nGeorge Sand and Alfred de Musset are sufficiently disgusting, and if\r\nthey be considered as novels, the evil effect of purpose--and\r\nparticularly of personal purpose--receives from them texts for a whole\r\nseries of sermons. Reading them with the experience of a lifetime, not\r\nmerely in literary criticism, but (for large parts of that lifetime) in\r\nstudy of evidence on historical, political, and even directly legal\r\nmatters, I cannot help coming to the conclusion that, though there is no\r\ndoubt a certain amount of _suggestio falsi_ in both, the _suppressio\r\nveri_ is infinitely greater in _Elle et Lui_. If the letters given in\r\nPaul de Musset's book were not written by George Sand they were written\r\nby Diabolus. And there is one retort made towards the finale by \"Édouard\r\nde Falconey\" (Musset) to \"William Caze\" (George Sand) which stigmatises\r\nlike the lash of a whip, if not even like a hot iron, the whole face of\r\nthe lady's novels.\r\n\r\n\"Ma chère,\" lui dit-il, \"vous parlez si souvent de chasteté que cela\r\ndevient indécent. Votre amitié n'est pas plus 'sainte' que celle des\r\nautres.\" [If he had added \"maternité\" the stigma would have been\r\ncompleter still.] And there is also a startling verisimilitude in the\r\nreply assigned to her:\r\n\r\n\"Mon cher, trouvez bon que je console mes amis selon ma méthode. Vous\r\nvoyez qu'elle leur plaît assez, puisqu'ils y reviennent.\"\r\n\r\nIt was true: they did so, rather to their own discredit and wholly to\r\ntheir discomfort. But she and her \"method\" must have pleased them enough\r\nfor them to do it. It is not so pleasing a method for an outsider to\r\ncontemplate. He sees too much of the game, and has none of the pleasure\r\nof playing or the occasional winnings. Since I read Hélisenne de Crenne\r\n(_v. sup._ Vol. I, pp. 150-1) there has seemed to me to be some likeness\r\nbetween the earlier stage of her heroine (if not of herself) and that of\r\nGeorge Sand in her \"friendships.\" They both display a good deal of mere\r\nsensuality, and both seem to me to have been quite ignorant of passion.\r\nHélisenne did not reach the stage of \"maternal\" affection, and perhaps\r\nit was well for her lover and not entirely bad for her readers. But the\r\nbest face that can be put on the \"method\" will be seen in _Lucrezia\r\nFloriani_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and on _Un Hiver à Majorque_.]\r\n\r\nThe bluntness of taste and the intense concentration on self, which were\r\nshown most disagreeably in _Elle et Lui_, appear on a different side in\r\nanother book which is not a novel at all--not even a novel as far as\r\nmasque and domino are concerned,--though indirectly it touches another\r\nof George Sand's curious personal experiences--that with Chopin. _Un\r\nHiver à Majorque_ is perhaps the most ill-tempered book of travel,\r\nexcept Smollett's too famous production, ever written by a novelist of\r\ntalent or genius. The Majorcans certainly did not ask George Sand to\r\nvisit them. They did not advertise the advantages of Majorca, as is the\r\nfashion with \"health resorts\" nowadays. She went there of her own\r\naccord; she found magnificent scenery; she flouted the sentiments of\r\nwhat she herself describes as the most priest-ridden country in Europe\r\nby never going to church, though and while she actually lived in a\r\ndisestablished and disendowed monastery. To punish them for which (the\r\n_non sequitur_ is intentional) she does little but talk of dirt,\r\ndiscomfort, bad food, extortion, foul-smelling oil and garlic, varying\r\nthe talk only to foul-smelling oil and garlic, extortion, bad food,\r\ndiscomfort, or dirt. The book no doubt yields some of her finest\r\npassages of descriptive prose, both as regards landscape, and in the\r\nfamous record of Chopin's playing; but otherwise it is hardly worth\r\nreading.\r\n\r\n[177] She survived into the next decade and worked till the last with no\r\ndistinct declension, but she did not complete it, dying in 1876. Her\r\nfamous direction about her grave, _Laissez la verdure_, is\r\ncharacteristic of her odd mixture if theatricality and true nature. But\r\nif any one wishes to come to her work with a comfortable preoccupation\r\nin favor of herself, he should begin with her _Letters_. Those of her\r\nold age especially are charming.\r\n\r\n[178] Cf. Mr. Alfred Lammle on his unpoetical justice to Mr. Fledgeby in\r\n_Our Mutual Friend_.\r\n\r\n[179] Valentine has an elder sister who has a son, irregularily\r\nexistent, but is as much in love with Benedict as if she were a girl and\r\nhe were a gentleman; and this son marries the much older Athenais, a\r\nlovely peasant girl who has been the unwilling _fiancée_ and wife of the\r\ningenious pitchforker. You have seldom to go far in George Sand for an\r\nunmarried lady with a child for chastity, and a widow who marries a boy\r\nfor maternal affection.\r\n\r\n[180] There is also an Irish priest called Magnus, who, like everybody\r\nelse, is deeply and (in the proper sense of _sans espoir_) desperately\r\nin love with Lélia. He is, on the whole, quite the maddest--and perhaps\r\nthe most despicable--of the lot.\r\n\r\n[181] If any one says, \"So, then, there are several 'most\r\nintolerables,'\" let me point out that intolerableness is a more than\r\n\"twy-peaked\" hill or range. Julien Sorel and Marius were not designed to\r\nbe gentlemen.\r\n\r\n[182] It is bad for Amélie, who, in a not unnatural revulsion from her\r\n_fiancé's_ neglects and eccentricities, lets herself be fooled by the\r\nhandsome Italian.\r\n\r\n[183] George Sand's treatment of the great Empress, Marie Antoinette's\r\nmother, is a curious mixture of half-reluctant admiration and Republican\r\nbad-bloodedness.\r\n\r\n[184] Porpora is included, but the amiable monarch, who has heard that\r\nthe old _maestro_ speaks freely of him, gives private orders that he\r\nshall be stopped at the frontier.\r\n\r\n[185] _Cow's_ breath has, I believe, been prescribed in such cases by\r\nthe faculty; hardly children's.\r\n\r\n[186] She does not make the delicate distinction once drawn by another\r\nof her sex: \"I can tell you how many people I have kissed, but I cannot\r\ntell you how many have kissed _me_.\"\r\n\r\n[187] She is rather fond of taking her readers into confidence this way.\r\nI have no particular objection to it; but those who object to\r\nThackeray's _parabases_ ought to think this is a still more\r\nobjectionable thing.\r\n\r\n[188] The Count Albani plays his difficult part of thirdsman very well\r\nthroughout, though just at first he would make an advance on \"auld lang\r\nsyne\" if Lucrezia would let him. But later he is on strict honour, and\r\nquarrels with the Prince for his tyranny.\r\n\r\n[189] It is very pleasing to see, as I have seen, this famous phrase\r\nquoted as if it had reference to the _joys_ of Arcadia.\r\n\r\n[190] If any among my congregation be offended by apparent flippancy in\r\nthis notice of a book which, to my profound astonishment, some people\r\nhave taken as the author's masterpiece, I apologise. But if I spoke more\r\nseriously I should also speak more severely.\r\n\r\n[191] He is a frantic devotee of the _Astrée_, and George Sand brings in\r\na good deal about the most agreeable book, without, however, showing\r\nvery intimate or accurate knowledge of it.\r\n\r\n[192] The Spaniard (rather his servant with his connivance) has murdered\r\nand robbed Bois-Doré's brother.\r\n\r\n[193] He is also very handsome, and so makes up for the plurality of the\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n[194] Alvimar lies dying for hours with the infidel Bohemians and\r\nroistering Protestant _reîtres_ not only disturbing his death-bed, but\r\ninterfering with the \"consolation of religion\"; the worst of the said\r\nBohemians is buried alive (or rather stifled after he has been\r\n_half_-buried alive) by the little gipsy girl, Pilar, whom he has\r\ntormented; and Pilar herself is burnt alive on the last page but one,\r\nafter she has poisoned Bellinde.\r\n\r\n[195] Taking her work on the whole. The earlier part of it ran even\r\nTrollope hard.\r\n\r\n[196] Her points of likeness to her self-naming name-child, \"George\r\nEliot,\" are too obvious to need discussion. But it is a question whether\r\nthe main points of _un_likeness--the facility and extreme fecundity of\r\nthe French George, as contrasted with the laborious book-bearing of the\r\nEnglish--are not more important than the numerous but superficial and to\r\na large extent non-literary resemblances.\r\n\r\n[197] I have said little or nothing of the short stories. They are\r\nfairly numerous, but I do not think that her _forte_ lay in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE NOVEL OF STYLE--GAUTIER, MÉRIMÉE, GÉRARD DE NERVAL, MUSSET, VIGNY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn arranging this volume I have thought it worth while to include, in a\r\nsingle chapter and _nominatim_ in the title thereof, five writers of\r\nprose novels or tales; all belonging to \"1830\"; four of them at least\r\nranking with all but the greatest of that great period; but no one\r\nexclusively or even essentially a novelist as Balzac and George Sand\r\nwere in their different ways, and none of them attempting such imposing\r\nbulk-and-plan of novel-matter as that which makes up the prose fiction\r\nof Hugo. Gautier was an admirable, and Musset and Vigny at their best\r\nwere each a consummate, poet; while the first-named was a \"polygraph\" of\r\nthe polygraphs, in every kind of _belles-lettres_. Mérimée's novels or\r\ntales form a small part of his whole work. \"Gérard\" is perhaps only\r\nadmissible here by courtesy, though more than one or two readers, I\r\nhope, would feel his absence as a dark gap in the book. Musset, again,\r\nnot ill at short stories, is far better at short plays. _One_ novel of\r\nVigny's has indeed enjoyed great fame; but, as will be seen, I am\r\nunluckily unable to admire it very much, and I include him here--partly\r\nbecause I do not wish to herd so clear a name with the Sues and the\r\nSouliés, even with the Sandeaus and Bernards--partly because, though his\r\nstyle in prose is not so marked as that in verse, some of his minor work\r\nin fiction is extremely interesting. But though so much of their work,\r\nand in Musset's and Vigny's cases all their best work, lies outside our\r\nprovince, and though they themselves, with the possible exception of\r\nGérard and Gautier, who have strong affinities, are markedly different\r\nfrom one another, there is one point which they all have in common, and\r\nthis point supplies the general title of this chapter. Style of the more\r\nseparable and elaborate kind does not often make its appearance very\r\nearly in literary departments; and there may be (_v. inf._) some special\r\nreasons why it should not do so in prose fiction. With the exception of\r\nMarivaux, who had carried his attention to it over the boundary-line of\r\nmannerism, few earlier novelists, though some of them were great\r\nwriters, had made a point of it, the chief exceptions being in the\r\nparticular line of \"wit,\" such as Hamilton, Crébillon _fils_, and\r\nVoltaire. Chateaubriand had been almost the first to attempt a\r\nnovel-_rhetoric_; and it must be remembered that Chateaubriand was a\r\nsort of human _magnus Apollo_ throughout the July monarchy. At any rate,\r\nit is a conspicuous feature in all these writers, and may serve as a\r\nlink between them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gautier--his burden of \"style.\"]\r\n\r\nSome readers may know (for I, and the others, which I shall probably\r\nquote again, have quoted it before now) a remark of Émile de Girardin\r\nwhen Théophile Gautier asked him how people liked a story which \"Théo\"\r\nhad prevailed on that experienced editor to insert as a _feuilleton_ in\r\nthe _Presse_: \"Mon ami, l'abonné ne s'amuse pas _franchement_. Il est\r\ngêné par le style.\" Girardin, though not exactly a genius, was an\r\nexceedingly clever man, and knew the foot of his public--perhaps of\r\n\"_the_ public\"--to a hundredth of an inch. But he could hardly have\r\nanticipated the extent to which his criticism would reflect the attitude\r\nof persons who would have been, and would be, not a little offended at\r\nbeing classed with _l'abonné_. The reproach of \"over-styling\" has been\r\ncast at Gautier by critics of the most different types, and--more\r\ncuriously at first sight than after a moment's reflection--by some who\r\nare themselves style-mad, but whose favourite vanities in that matter\r\nare different from his. I can hardly think of any writer--Herrick as\r\ntreated by Hazlitt is the chief exception that occurs to me at the\r\nmoment--against whom this cheap and obvious, though, alas! not very\r\nfrequently possible, charge of \"bright far-shining emptiness,\" of\r\nglittering frigidity, of colour without flesh and blood, of art without\r\nmatter, etc., etc., has been cast so violently--or so unjustly. In\r\nliterature, as in law and war, the favourite method of offensive defence\r\nis to reserve your _triarii_, your \"colophon\" of arms or arguement, to\r\nthe last; but there are cases in all three where it is best to carry an\r\nimportant point at once and hold it. I think that this is one of these\r\ncases; and I do not think that the operation can be conducted with\r\nbetter chance of success than by inserting here that outline,[198] with\r\nspecimens, of _La Morte Amoureuse_ which has been already promised--or\r\nthreatened--in the Preface. For here the glamour--if it be only\r\nglamour--of the style will have disappeared; the matter will remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Sidenote: Abstract (with translations) of _La Morte\r\n     Amoureuse_.]\r\n\r\n     You ask me, my brother, if I have ever loved. I answer\r\n     \"Yes.\" But it is a wild and terrible story, a memory whose\r\n     ashes, with all my sixty-six years, I hardly dare to\r\n     disturb. To you I can refuse nothing, but I would not tell\r\n     the tale to a less experienced soul. The facts are so\r\n     strange that I myself cannot believe in their actual\r\n     occurrence. For three years I was the victim of a diabolical\r\n     delusion, and every night--God grant it was a dream--I, a\r\n     poor country priest, led the life of the lost, the life of\r\n     the worldling and the debauchee. A single chance of too\r\n     great complacency went near to destroy my soul; but at last,\r\n     with God's aid and my patron saint's, I exorcised the evil\r\n     spirit which had gained possession of me. Till then my life\r\n     was double, and the counterpart by night was utterly\r\n     different from the life by day. By day I was a priest of the\r\n     Lord, pure, and busied with holy things. By night, no sooner\r\n     had I closed my eyes than I became a youthful gallant,\r\n     critical in women, dogs, and horses, prompt with dice and\r\n     bottle, free of hand and tongue; and when waking-time came\r\n     at dawn of day, it seemed to me as if I then fell asleep and\r\n     was a priest only in dreams. From this sleep-life I have\r\n     kept the memory of words and things, which recur to me\r\n     against my will; and though I have never quitted the walls\r\n     of my parsonage, those who hear me talk would rather think\r\n     me a man of the world and of many experiences, who has\r\n     entered the religious life hoping to finish in God's bosom\r\n     the evening of his stormy day, than a humble seminarist,\r\n     whose life has been spent in an obscure parish, buried deep\r\n     in woods, and far removed from the course of the world.\r\n\r\n     Yes, I have loved--as no one else has loved, with a mad and\r\n     wild passion so violent that I can hardly understand how it\r\n     failed to break my heart.\r\n\r\nAfter rapidly sketching the history of the early seminary days of the\r\npriest Romuald, his complete seclusion and ignorance almost of the very\r\nnames of world and woman, the tale goes on to the day of his ordination.\r\nHe is in the church, almost in a trance of religious fervour; the\r\nbuilding itself, the gorgeously robed bishop, the stately ceremonies,\r\nseem to him a foretaste of heaven, when suddenly--\r\n\r\n     By chance I raised my head, which I had hitherto kept bowed,\r\n     and saw before me, within arm's length as it seemed, but in\r\n     reality at some distance and beyond the chancel rails, a\r\n     woman of rare beauty and royally apparelled. At once, as it\r\n     were, scales dropped from my eyes. I was in the case of a\r\n     blind man whose sight is suddenly restored. The bishop, but\r\n     now so dazzling to me, became dim, the tapers in their\r\n     golden stands paled like the stars at morning, and darkness\r\n     seemed to pervade the church. On this background of shade\r\n     the lovely vision stood out like an angelic appearance,\r\n     self-illumined, and giving rather than receiving light. I\r\n     dropped my eyelids, firmly resolving not again to raise\r\n     them, that so I might escape the distraction of outward\r\n     things, for I felt the spell more and more, and I hardly\r\n     knew what I did; but a minute afterwards I again looked up,\r\n     for I perceived her beauty still shining across my dropped\r\n     lashes as if with prismatic glory, and encircled by the\r\n     crimson halo that, to the gazer, surrounds the sun. How\r\n     beautiful she was! Painters, when in their chase of the\r\n     ideal they have followed it to the skies and carried off\r\n     therefrom the divine image of Our Lady, never drew near this\r\n     fabulous reality. Nor are the poet's words more adequate\r\n     than the colours of the limner. She was tall and\r\n     goddess-like in shape and port. Her soft fair hair rolled on\r\n     either side of her temples in golden streams that crowned\r\n     her as with a queen's diadem. Her forehead, white and\r\n     transparent, tinged only by blue vein-stains, stretched in\r\n     calm amplitude over two dark eyebrows--a contrast enhanced\r\n     still further by the sea-green lustre of her glittering and\r\n     unfathomable eyes. Ah, what eyes! One flash of them was\r\n     enough to settle the fate of a man. Never had I seen in\r\n     human eyes such life, such clearness, such ardour, such\r\n     humid brilliancy; and there shot from them glances like\r\n     arrows, which went straight to my heart. Whether the flame\r\n     which lit them came from hell or heaven I know not, but from\r\n     one or the other it came, most surely. No daughter of Eve\r\n     she, but an angel or a fiend, perhaps--who knows?--something\r\n     of both. The quarrelets of pearl flashed through her scarlet\r\n     smile, and as her mouth moved the dimples sank and filled by\r\n     turns in the blush-rose softness of her exquisite cheek.\r\n     Over the even smoothness of her half-uncovered shoulders\r\n     played a floating gloss as of agate, and a river of large\r\n     pearls, not greatly different in hue from her neck,\r\n     descended towards her breast. Now and then she raised her\r\n     head with a peacock-like gesture, and sent a quiver through\r\n     the ruff which enshrined her like a frame of silver\r\n     filigree.\r\n\r\nThe strange vision causes on Romuald strange yet natural effects. His\r\nardent aspiration for the priesthood changes to loathing. He even tries\r\nto renounce his vows, to answer \"No\" to the questions to which he should\r\nanswer \"Yes,\" and thus to comply with the apparent demand of the\r\nstranger's eyes. But he cannot. The awe of the ceremony is yet too\r\nstrong on his soul, if not on his senses and imagination; and the fatal\r\nwords are spoken, the fatal rites gone through, despite the promises of\r\nuntold bliss which the eyes, evermore caressing and entreating, though\r\nsadder, as the completion of the sacrifice approaches, continue to make\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n     At last it was over--I was a priest. Never did face of woman\r\n     wear an expression of such anguish as hers. The girl whose\r\n     lover drops lifeless at her side, the mother by her dead\r\n     child's cradle, Eve at the gate of paradise, the miser who\r\n     finds his buried treasure replaced by a stone, the poet\r\n     whose greatest work has perished in the flames, have not a\r\n     more desolate air. The blood left her countenance, and it\r\n     became as of marble; her arms fell by her side, as if their\r\n     muscles had become flaccid; and she leant against a pillar,\r\n     for her limbs refused to support her. As for me, with a\r\n     livid face bathed as if in the dews of death, I bent my\r\n     tottering steps towards the church door. The air seemed to\r\n     stifle me, the vaulted roof settled on my shoulders, and on\r\n     my head seemed to rest the whole crushing weight of the\r\n     dome. As I was on the point of crossing the threshold a hand\r\n     touched mine suddenly--a woman's hand--a touch how new to\r\n     me! It was as cold as the skin of a serpent, yet the contact\r\n     burnt like the brand of a hot iron. \"Unhappy wretch! What\r\n     have you done?\" she said to me in a low voice, and then\r\n     disappeared in the crowd.\r\n\r\nOn the way to the seminary, whither a comrade has to support him, for\r\nhis emotion is evident to all, a page, unnoticed, slips into Romuald's\r\nhand a tablet with the simple words, \"Clarimonde. At the Concini\r\nPalace.\" He passes some days in a state almost of delirium, now forming\r\nwild plans of escape, now shocked at his sinful desires, but always\r\nregretting the world he has renounced, and still more Clarimonde.\r\n\r\n     I do not know how long I remained in this condition, but, as\r\n     in one of my furious writhings I turned on my bed, I saw the\r\n     Father Serapion standing in the middle of the cell gazing\r\n     steadily at me. Shame seized me, and I hid my face with my\r\n     hands. \"Romuald,\" said he, at the end of a few minutes,\r\n     \"something extraordinary has come on you. Your conduct is\r\n     inexplicable. You, so pious, so gentle, you pace your cell\r\n     like a caged beast. Take heed, my brother, of the\r\n     suggestions of the Evil One, for he is wroth that you have\r\n     given yourself to the Lord, and lurks round you like a\r\n     ravening wolf, if haply a last effort may make you his.\"\r\n\r\nThen, bidding him redouble his pious exercises, and telling him that he\r\nhas been presented by the bishop to a country cure, and must be ready to\r\nstart on the morrow, Serapion leaves him. Romuald is in despair at\r\nquitting the neighbourhood of Clarimonde. But his seminarist\r\ninexperience makes him feel, more than ever, the impossibility even of\r\ndiscovering her, and the hints of Serapion have in a manner reawakened\r\nhis conscience. He departs on the morrow without protest. They quit the\r\ncity, and begin to climb the hills which surround it.\r\n\r\n     At the top I turned round once more to give a last look to\r\n     the place where dwelt Clarimonde. The city lay wholly in the\r\n     shadow of a cloud; its blue and red roofs were blended in\r\n     one general half-tint, above which here and there white\r\n     flakes of the smoke of morning fires hovered. By some\r\n     optical accident a single edifice stood out gilded by a ray\r\n     of light, and more lofty than the mass of surrounding\r\n     buildings. Though more than a league off, it seemed close to\r\n     us. The smallest details were visible--the turrets, the\r\n     terraces, the windows, and even the swallow-tailed vanes.\r\n     \"What is that sunlit palace yonder?\" I asked of Serapion. He\r\n     shaded his eyes with his hand, and after looking he\r\n     answered, \"It is the palace which Prince Concini gave to the\r\n     courtesan Clarimonde. Terrible things are done there.\" As he\r\n     spoke, whether it were fact or fancy I know not, it seemed\r\n     to me that I saw a slender white form glide out on the\r\n     terrace, glitter there for a second, and then disappear. It\r\n     was Clarimonde! Could she have known that at that moment,\r\n     from the rugged heights of the hill which separated me from\r\n     her, and which I was never more to descend, I was bending a\r\n     restless and burning gaze on the palace of her abode,\r\n     brought near me by a mocking play of light, as if to invite\r\n     me to enter? Ah yes! she knew it doubtless, for her soul was\r\n     bound to mine too nearly not to feel its least movements;\r\n     and this it must have been which urged her to climb the\r\n     terrace in the cold morning dews, wrapped only in her snowy\r\n     nightgear.\r\n\r\nBut the die is cast, and the journey continues. They reach the modest\r\nparsonage where Romuald is to pass the rest of his days, and he is\r\ninstalled in his cure, Serapion returning to the city. Romuald attacks\r\nhis work desperately, hoping to find peace there, but he very partially\r\nsucceeds. The words of Clarimonde and the touch of her hand haunt him\r\nconstantly, and sometimes even stranger things happen. He sees the flash\r\nof the sea-green eyes across his garden hedges; he seems to find the\r\nimprint of feet, which are assuredly not those of any inhabitant of the\r\nvillage, on the gravel walks. At last one night he is summoned late to\r\nthe bedside of a dying person, by a messenger of gorgeous dress and\r\noutlandish aspect. The journey is made in the darkness on fiery steeds,\r\nthrough strange scenery, and in an unknown direction. A splendid palace\r\nis at length reached--too late, for the priest is met by the news that\r\nhis penitent has already expired. But he is entreated, and consents, at\r\nleast to watch and pray by the body during the night. He is led into the\r\nchamber of death, and finds that the corpse is Clarimonde. At first he\r\nmechanically turns to prayer, but other thoughts inevitably occur. His\r\neyes wander to the appearance and furniture of the boudoir suddenly put\r\nto so different use: the gorgeous hangings of crimson damask contrasting\r\nwith the white shroud, the faded rose by the bedside, the scattered\r\nsigns of revelry, distract and disturb him. Strange fancies come thick.\r\nThe air seems other than that to which he is accustomed in such chambers\r\nof the dead. The corpse appears from time to time to make slight\r\nmovements; even sighs seem to echo his own. At last he lifts the veil\r\nwhich covers her, and contemplates the exquisite features he had last\r\nseen at the fatal moment of his sacrifice. He cannot believe that she is\r\ndead. The faint blush-rose tints are hardly dulled, the hand is not\r\ncolder than he recollects it.\r\n\r\n     The night was now far spent. I felt that the moment of\r\n     eternal separation was at hand, and I could not refuse\r\n     myself the last sad pleasure of giving one kiss to the dead\r\n     lips of her, who, living, had had all my love. Oh, wonder! A\r\n     faint breath mingled with mine, the eyes opened and became\r\n     once more brilliant. She sighed, and uncrossing her arms she\r\n     clasped them round my neck with an air of ineffable\r\n     contentment. \"Ah!\" she said, with a voice as faint and as\r\n     sweet as the last dying vibrations of a harp, \"is it you,\r\n     Romuald? I have waited for you so long that now I am dead.\r\n     But we are betrothed to one another from this moment, and I\r\n     can see you and visit you henceforward. Romuald, I loved\r\n     you! Farewell; this is all I have to say; and thus I restore\r\n     the life you gave me for a minute with your kiss. We shall\r\n     soon meet again.\" Her head fell back, but she still held me\r\n     encircled. A furious gust of wind forced in the window and\r\n     swept into the room: the last leaflet of the white rose\r\n     quivered for a minute on its stalk and then fell, and\r\n     floated through the open casement, bearing with it the soul\r\n     of Clarimonde. The lamp went out, and I sank in a swoon.\r\n\r\nHe wakes in his own room, and hears from his ancient _gouvernante_ that\r\nthe same strange escort which carried him off has brought him back.\r\nSoon afterwards his friend Serapion comes to visit him, not altogether\r\nto his delight, for he, rightly suspects the father of some knowledge of\r\nhis secret. Serapion announces to him, as a matter of general news, that\r\nthe courtesan Clarimonde is dead, and mentions that strange rumours have\r\nbeen current respecting her--some declaring her to be a species of\r\nvampire, and her lovers to have all perished mysteriously. As he says\r\nthis he watches Romuald, who cannot altogether conceal his thoughts.\r\nThereat Serapion--\r\n\r\n     \"My son,\" said he, \"it is my duty to warn you that your feet\r\n     are on the brink of an abyss; take heed of falling. Satan's\r\n     hands reach far, and the grave is not always a faithful\r\n     gaoler. Clarimonde's tombstone should be sealed with a\r\n     triple seal, for it is not, say they, the first time she has\r\n     died. May God watch over you.\" Saying this, Serapion slowly\r\n     went out, and I saw him no more. I soon recovered\r\n     completely, and returned to my usual occupations; and though\r\n     I never forgot the memory of Clarimonde and the words of the\r\n     father, nothing extraordinary for a time occurred to confirm\r\n     in any way his ill-omened forebodings, so that I began to\r\n     believe that his apprehensions and my own terror were\r\n     unfounded. But one night I had a dream. Scarcely had I\r\n     fallen asleep when I heard my bed-curtains drawn, the rings\r\n     grating sharply on the rods. I raised myself abruptly on my\r\n     elbow and saw before me the shadowy figure of a woman. At\r\n     once I recognised Clarimonde. She carried in her hand a\r\n     small lamp of the shape of those which are placed in tombs,\r\n     and the light of it gave to her tapering fingers a rosy\r\n     transparency which, with gradually fainter tints, prolonged\r\n     itself till it was lost in the milky whiteness of her naked\r\n     arm. The only garment she had on was the linen shroud which\r\n     covered her on her death-bed, and she tried to hold up its\r\n     folds on her breast as if shame-stricken at her scanty\r\n     clothing. But her little hand was not equal to the task; and\r\n     so white was she that the lamplight failed to make\r\n     distinction between the colour of the drapery and the hue of\r\n     the flesh. Wrapped in this fine tissue, she was more like an\r\n     antique marble statue of a bather than a live woman. Dead or\r\n     alive, woman or statue, shadow or body, her beauty was\r\n     unchangeable, but the green flash of her eyes was somewhat\r\n     dulled, and her mouth, so red of old, was now tinted only\r\n     with a faint rose-tint like that of her cheeks. The blue\r\n     flowerets in her hair were withered and had lost almost all\r\n     their petals; yet she was still all charming--so charming\r\n     that, despite the strangeness of the adventure and the\r\n     unexplained fashion of her entrance, no thought of fear\r\n     occurred to me. She placed the lamp on the table and seated\r\n     herself on the foot of my bed; then, bending towards me, she\r\n     spoke in the soft and silvery voice that I have heard from\r\n     none but her. \"I have kept you waiting long, dear Romuald,\r\n     and you must have thought that I had forgotten you. But I\r\n     come from very far--from a place whence no traveller has yet\r\n     returned. There is neither sun nor moon, nor aught but space\r\n     and shadow; no road is there, nor pathway to guide the foot,\r\n     nor air to uphold the wing; and yet here am I, for love is\r\n     stronger than death, and is his master at the last. Ah! what\r\n     sad faces, what sights of terror, I have met! With what\r\n     pains has my soul, regaining this world by force of will,\r\n     found again my body and reinstalled itself! With what effort\r\n     have I lifted the heavy slab they laid upon me, even to the\r\n     bruising of my poor feeble hands! Kiss them, dear love, and\r\n     they will be cured.\" She placed one by one the cold palms of\r\n     her little hands against my mouth, and I kissed them again\r\n     and again, while she watched me with her smile of ineffable\r\n     content. I at once forgot Serapion's advice, I forgot my\r\n     sacred office; I succumbed without resistance at the first\r\n     summons, I did not even attempt to repulse the tempter.\r\n\r\nShe tells him how she had dreamed of him long before she saw him; how\r\nshe had striven to prevent his sacrifice; how she was jealous of God,\r\nwhom he preferred to her; and how, though she had forced the gates of\r\nthe tomb to come to him, though he had given life back to her with a\r\nkiss, though her recovery of it has no other end than to make him happy,\r\nshe herself is still miserable because she has only half his heart. In\r\nhis delirium he tells her, to console her, that he loves her \"as much as\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\n\"Instantly the glitter as of chrysoprase flashed once more from her\r\neyes. 'Is that true?--as much as God?' cried she, winding her arms round\r\nme. 'If 'tis so you can come with me; you can follow me whither I\r\nwill.'\" And fixing the next night for the rendezvous, she vanishes. He\r\nwakes, and, considering it merely a dream, resumes his pious exercises.\r\nBut the next night Clarimonde, faithful to her word, reappears--no\r\nlonger in ghostly attire, but radiant and splendidly dressed. She brings\r\nher lover the full costume of a cavalier, and when he has donned it\r\nthey sally forth, taking first the fiery steeds of his earlier nocturnal\r\nadventure, then a carriage, in which he and Clarimonde, heart to heart,\r\nhead on shoulder, hand in hand, journey through the night.\r\n\r\n     Never had I been so happy. For the moment I had forgotten\r\n     everything, and thought no more of my priesthood than of\r\n     some previous state of life. From that night forward my\r\n     existence was as it were doubled, and there were in me two\r\n     men, strangers each to the other's existence. Sometimes I\r\n     thought myself a priest who dreamt that he was a gallant,\r\n     sometimes a gallant who dreamt that he was a priest.... I\r\n     could not distinguish the reality from the illusion, and\r\n     knew not which were my waking and which my sleeping moments.\r\n     Two spirals, entangled without touching, form the nearest\r\n     representation of this life. The young cavalier, the\r\n     coxcomb, the debauchee, mocked the priest; the priest held\r\n     the dissipations of the gallant in horror. Notwithstanding\r\n     the strangeness of the situation, I do not think my reason\r\n     was for a moment affected. The perceptions of my two\r\n     existences were always firm and clear, and there was only\r\n     one anomaly which I could not explain, and this was that the\r\n     same unbroken sentiment of identity subsisted in two beings\r\n     so different. Of this I could give myself no explanation,\r\n     whether I thought myself to be really the vicar of a poor\r\n     country village, or else Il Signor Romualdo, lover in\r\n     possession of Clarimonde.\r\n\r\nThe place, real or apparent, of Il Signor Romualdo's sojourn with his\r\nbeloved is Venice, where they inhabit a gorgeous palace, and where\r\nRomuald enters into all the follies and dissipations of the place. He is\r\nunalterably faithful to Clarimonde, and she to him; and the time passes\r\nin a perpetual delirium. But every night--as it now seems to him--he\r\nfinds himself once more a poor country priest, horrified at the misdeeds\r\nof his other personality, and seeking to atone for them by prayer and\r\nfasting and good works. Even in his Venetian moments he sometimes thinks\r\nof Serapion's words, and at length he has especial reason to remember\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n     For some time Clarimonde's health had not been very good;\r\n     her complexion faded from day to day. The doctors who were\r\n     called in could not discover the disease, and after useless\r\n     prescriptions gave up the case. Day by day she grew paler\r\n     and colder, till she was nearly as white and as corpse-like\r\n     as on the famous night at the mysterious castle. I was in\r\n     despair at this wasting away, but she, though touched by my\r\n     sorrow, only smiled at me sweetly and sadly with the fatal\r\n     smile of those who feel their death approaching. One morning\r\n     I was sitting by her. In slicing some fruit it happened that\r\n     I cut my finger somewhat deeply. The blood flowed in crimson\r\n     streamlets, and some of it spurted on Clarimonde. Her eyes\r\n     brightened at once, and over her face there passed a look of\r\n     fierce joy which I had never before seen in her. She sprang\r\n     from the bed with catlike activity and pounced on the wound,\r\n     which she began to suck with an air of indescribable\r\n     delight, swallowing the blood in sips, slowly and carefully,\r\n     as an epicure tastes a costly vintage. Her eyelids were half\r\n     closed, and the pupils of her sea-green eyes flattened and\r\n     became oblong instead of round.... From time to time she\r\n     interrupted herself to kiss my hand; then she began again to\r\n     squeeze the edges of the wound with her lips in order to\r\n     draw from it a few more crimson drops. When she saw that the\r\n     blood ran no longer, she rose with bright and humid eyes,\r\n     rosier than a May morning, her cheeks full, her hands warm,\r\n     yet no longer parched, fairer in short than ever, and in\r\n     perfect health. \"I shall not die! I shall not die!\" she\r\n     said, clasping my neck in a frenzy of joy. \"I can live long\r\n     and love you. My life is in yours, my very existence comes\r\n     from you. A few drops of your generous blood, more precious\r\n     and sovereign than all the elixirs of the world, have given\r\n     me back to life.\"\r\n\r\n     This scene gave me matter for much reflection, and put into\r\n     my head some strange thoughts as to Clarimonde. That very\r\n     evening, when sleep had transported me to my parsonage, I\r\n     found there Father Serapion, graver and more careworn than\r\n     ever. He looked at me attentively and said, \"Not content\r\n     with destroying your soul, are you bent also on destroying\r\n     your body? Unhappy youth, into what snares have you fallen!\"\r\n     The tone in which he said this struck me much at the time;\r\n     but, lively as the impression was, other thoughts soon drove\r\n     it from my mind. However, one evening, with the aid of a\r\n     glass, on whose tell-tale position Clarimonde had not\r\n     counted, I saw her pouring a powder into the cup of spiced\r\n     wine which she was wont to prepare after supper. I took the\r\n     cup, and, putting it to my lips, I set it down, as if\r\n     intending to finish it at leisure. But in reality I availed\r\n     myself of a minute when her back was turned to empty it\r\n     away, and I soon after went to bed, determined to remain\r\n     awake and see what would happen. I had not long to wait.\r\n     Clarimonde entered as soon as she had convinced herself that\r\n     I slept. She uncovered my arm and drew from her hair a\r\n     little gold pin; then she murmured under her breath, \"Only\r\n     one drop, one little crimson drop, one ruby just to tip the\r\n     bodkin! As you love me still I must not die. Ah, poor love!\r\n     I am going to drink his blood, his beautiful blood, so\r\n     bright and so purple. Sleep, my only treasure; sleep, my\r\n     darling, my deity; I will do you no harm; I will only take\r\n     so much of your life as I need to save my own. Did I not\r\n     love you so much I might resolve to have other lovers, whose\r\n     veins I could drain; but since I have known you I hate all\r\n     others. Ah, dear arm, how round it is, and how white! How\r\n     shall I ever dare to pierce the sweet blue veins!\" And while\r\n     she spoke she wept, so that I felt her tears rain on the arm\r\n     she held. At last she summoned courage; she pricked me\r\n     slightly with the bodkin and began to suck out the blood.\r\n     But she drank only a few drops, as if she feared to exhaust\r\n     me, and then carefully bound up my arm after anointing it\r\n     with an unguent which closed the wound at once. I could now\r\n     doubt no longer: Serapion was right. Yet, in spite of this\r\n     certainty, I could not help loving Clarimonde, and I would\r\n     willingly have given her all the blood whereof she had need,\r\n     to sustain her artificial life. Besides, I had not much to\r\n     fear; the woman was my warrant against the vampire; and what\r\n     I had heard and seen completely reassured me. I had then\r\n     well-nourished veins, which were not to be soon drawn dry,\r\n     nor had I reason to grudge and count their drops. I would\r\n     have pierced my arm myself and bid her drink. I was careful\r\n     to make not the slightest allusion to the narcotic she had\r\n     given me, or to the scene that followed, and we lived in\r\n     unbroken harmony. But my priestly scruples tormented me more\r\n     than ever, and I knew not what new penance to invent to\r\n     blunt my passion and mortify my flesh. Though my visions\r\n     were wholly involuntary and my will had nothing to do with\r\n     them, I shrank from touching the host with hands thus\r\n     sullied and spirit defiled by debauchery, whether in act or\r\n     in dream. To avoid falling into these harassing\r\n     hallucinations, I tried to prevent myself sleeping; I held\r\n     my eyelids open, and remained in a standing posture,\r\n     striving with all my force against sleep. But soon the waves\r\n     of slumber drowned my eyes, and seeing that the struggle was\r\n     hopeless, I let my hands drop in weariness, and was once\r\n     more carried to the shores of delusion.... Serapion exhorted\r\n     me most fervently, and never ceased reproaching me with my\r\n     weakness and my lack of zeal. One day, when I had been more\r\n     agitated than usual, he said to me, \"There is only one way\r\n     to relieve you from this haunting plague, and, though it be\r\n     extreme, we must try it. Great evils need heroic remedies. I\r\n     know where Clarimonde was buried; we must disinter her, and\r\n     you shall see the real state of your lady-love. You will\r\n     hardly be tempted to risk your soul for a vile body, the\r\n     prey of worms and ready to turn to dust. That, if anything,\r\n     will restore you to yourself.\" For my part, I was so weary\r\n     of this double life that I closed with his offer. I longed\r\n     to know once for all, which--priest or gallant--was the\r\n     dupe of a delusion, and I was resolved to sacrifice one of\r\n     my two lives for the good of the other--yea, if it were\r\n     necessary, to sacrifice both, for such an existence as I was\r\n     leading could not last.... Father Serapion procured a\r\n     mattock, a crowbar, and a lantern, and at midnight we set\r\n     out for the cemetery, whose plan and arrangements he knew\r\n     well. After directing the rays of the dark lantern on the\r\n     inscriptions of several graves, we came at last to a stone\r\n     half buried under tall grass, and covered with moss and\r\n     lichen, whereon we deciphered this epitaph, \"Here lies\r\n     Clarimonde, who in her lifetime was the fairest in the\r\n     world.\" \"'Tis here,\" said Serapion; and, placing his lantern\r\n     on the ground, he slipped the crowbar into the chinks of the\r\n     slab and essayed to lift it. The stone yielded, and he set\r\n     to work with the spade. As for me, stiller and more gloomy\r\n     than the night itself, I watched him at work, while he,\r\n     bending over his ill-omened task, sweated and panted, his\r\n     forced and heavy breath sounding like the gasps of the\r\n     dying. The sight was strange, and lookers-on would rather\r\n     have taken us for tomb-breakers and robbers of the dead than\r\n     for God's priests. The zeal of Serapion was of so harsh and\r\n     savage a cast, that it gave him a look more of the demon\r\n     than of the apostle or the angel, and his face, with its\r\n     severe features deeply marked by the glimmer of the lantern,\r\n     was hardly reassuring. A cold sweat gathered on my limbs and\r\n     my hair stood on end. In my heart I held Serapion's deed to\r\n     be an abominable sacrilege, and I could have wished that a\r\n     flash of lightning might issue from the womb of the heavy\r\n     clouds, which rolled low above our heads, and burn him to\r\n     ashes. The owls perched about the cypress trees, and,\r\n     disturbed by the lantern, came and flapped its panes heavily\r\n     with their dusty wings, the foxes barked in the distance,\r\n     and a thousand sinister echoes troubled the silence. At\r\n     length Serapion's spade struck the coffin with the terrible\r\n     hollow sound that nothingness returns to those who intrude\r\n     on it. He lifted the lid, and I saw Clarimonde, as pale as\r\n     marble, and with her hands joined; there was no fold in her\r\n     snow-white shroud from head to foot; at the corner of her\r\n     blanched lips there shone one little rosy drop. At the sight\r\n     Serapion broke into fury. \"Ah! fiend, foul harlot, drinker\r\n     of gold and blood, we have found you!\" said he, and he\r\n     scattered holy water over corpse and coffin, tracing the\r\n     sign of the cross with his brush. No sooner had the blessed\r\n     shower touched my Clarimonde than her fair body crumbled\r\n     into dust, and became nought but a hideous mixture of ashes\r\n     and half-burnt bones. \"There, Signor Romuald,\" said the\r\n     inexorable priest, pointing to the remains, \"there is your\r\n     mistress. Are you still tempted to escort her to the Lido or\r\n     to Fusina?\" I bowed my head; a mighty ruin had taken place\r\n     within me. I returned to my parsonage, and Il Signor\r\n     Romualdo, the lover of Clarimonde, said farewell for ever to\r\n     the poor priest whose strange companion he had been so long.\r\n     Only the next night I again saw Clarimonde. She said to me,\r\n     as at first in the church porch, \"Poor wretch, what have you\r\n     done? Why did you listen to that frantic priest? Were you\r\n     not happy? And what harm had I done you that you should\r\n     violate my grave, and shamefully expose the misery of my\r\n     nothingness? Henceforward all communication between us, soul\r\n     and body, is broken. Farewell, you will regret me.\" She\r\n     vanished in the air like a vapour, and I saw her no more.\r\n\r\n     Alas! she spoke too truly. I have regretted her again and\r\n     again. I regret her still. The repose of my soul has indeed\r\n     been dearly bought, and the love of God itself has not been\r\n     too much to replace the gap left by hers. This, my brother,\r\n     is the history of my youth. Never look at woman, and let\r\n     your eyes as you walk be fixed upon the ground; for, pure\r\n     and calm as you may be, a single moment is sufficient to\r\n     make you lose your eternal peace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism thereof.]\r\n\r\nNow, though to see a thing in translation be always to see it \"as in a\r\nglass darkly\"; and though in this case the glass may be unduly flawed\r\nand clouded, my own critical faculties must not only now be\r\nunusually[199] enfeebled by age, but must always have been crippled by\r\nsome strange affection, if certain things are not visible here to any\r\nintelligent and impartial reader. The story, of course, is not pure\r\ninvention; several versions of parts, if not the whole, of it will occur\r\nto any one who has some knowledge of literature; and I have recently\r\nread a variant of great beauty and \"eeriness\" from the Japanese.[200]\r\nBut the merit of a story depends, not on its originality as matter, but\r\non the manner in which it is told. It surely cannot be denied that this\r\nis told excellently. That the part of Serapion (though somebody or\r\nsomething of the kind is almost necessary) is open to some criticism,\r\nmay be granted. He seems to know too much and yet not enough: and if he\r\nwas to interfere at all, one does not see why he did not do it earlier.\r\nBut this is the merest hole-picking, and the biggest hole it can make\r\nwill not catch the foot or the little finger of any worthy reader. As to\r\nthe beauty of the phrasing, even in another language, and as rendered by\r\nno consummate artist, there can be little question about that. Indeed\r\nthere we have consent about Gautier, though, as has been seen, the\r\nconsent has not always been thoroughly complimentary to him. To go a\r\nstep further, the way in which the diction and imagery are made to\r\nprovide frame and shade and colour for the narrative leaves very little\r\nroom for cavil. Without any undue or excessive \"prose poetry,\" the\r\ndescriptions are like those of the best imaginative-pictorial verse\r\nitself. The first appearance of Clarimonde; the scene at her death-bed\r\nand that of her dream-resurrection, have, I dare affirm it, never been\r\nsurpassed in verse or prose for their special qualities: while the\r\nbackward view of the city and the recital of what we may call Serapion's\r\nsoul-murder of the enchantress come little behind them.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be said, \"You are still kicking at open doors. The degree of\r\nyour estimate is, we think, extravagant, but that it is deserved to some\r\nextent nobody denies. In mere point of expression, and even to some\r\nextent, again, in conception of beauty, Gautier's manner, though too\r\nmuch of one kind, and that too old-fashioned, is admitted; it is his\r\nmatter which is questioned or denied.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A parallel from painting.]\r\n\r\nHere also, I think, the counter-attack can be completely barred or\r\nbroken to the satisfaction of all but those who cannot or will not see.\r\nIn the first place one must make a distinction, which ought not to be\r\nregarded as over-subtilising, but which certainly seems to be ignored by\r\nmany people. There are in all arts, and more especially in the art of\r\nliterature, two stages or sets of stages in the discharge of that duty\r\nof every artist--the creation of beauty. The one is satisfied by the\r\nachievement of the beautiful in the presentation itself; the other gives\r\nyou, in your own interior collection or museum, the thing presented.\r\nThis is not the common distinction between form and matter, between\r\nstyle and substance, between subject and treatment; it is something more\r\nintimate and \"metaphysical.\" To illustrate it, let me take a pair of\r\ninstances, not from letters, but from painting as produced by two dead\r\nmasters of our own, Rossetti and Albert Moore. I used to think the\r\nlast-named painter disgracefully undervalued both by the public and by\r\ncritics. One could look at those primrose-tinted ladies of his, with\r\ntheir gossamer films of raiment and their flowerage always suggestive of\r\nthe asphodel mead, for hours: and if one's soul had had a substantial\r\nPalace of Art of her own, there would have been a corridor wholly Albert\r\nMoorish--a corridor, for his things never looked well with other\r\npeople's and they could not, by themselves, have filled a hall.\r\n\r\nBut their beauty, as has been untruly said of Gautier's representation\r\nin the other art, _was_ \"their sole duty.\" You never wanted to kiss even\r\nthe most beautiful of them, or to talk to her, or even to sit at her\r\nfeet, except for purposes of looking at her, for which that position has\r\nits own special advantages. And although by no means mere pastiches or\r\nreplicas of each other, they had little of the qualities which\r\nconstitute personality. They were almost literally \"dreams that waved\r\nbefore the half-shut eye,\" and dreams which you knew to be dreams at the\r\ntime; less even than dreams--shadows, and less even than shadows, for\r\nshadows imply substance, and these did not. If you loved them you loved\r\nthem always, and could not be divorced from them. But it was an entirely\r\ncontemplative love; and if divorce was unthinkable it was because there\r\nwas no _thorus_ and no _mensa_ at which they could possibly have\r\nfigured.[201] They were the Eves of a Paradise of _two_ dimensions only.\r\n\r\nNow with Rossetti it was entirely different. His drawing may have been\r\nas faulty as people said it was, and he may have been as fond as they\r\nalso said of bestowing upon all his subjects exaggerated and almost\r\nungainly features, which possibly belonged to the Blessed Damozel, but\r\nwere not the most indisputable part of her blessedness. But they were,\r\ndespite their similarity of type, all personal and individual, and all\r\nsuggestive to the mind and the emotions of real women, and of the things\r\nwhich real women are and do and suffer. And they were all differently\r\nsuggestive. Proserpine and Beata Beatrix; the devotional figures in\r\ntheir quietude or their ecstasy, and the forlorn leaguer-lasses of that\r\nlittle masterpiece of the novitiate, \"Hesterna Rosa\"; the Damozel\r\nherself and a Corsican lady whose portrait, unpublished and unexhibited,\r\nhas been familiar to me for six-and-thirty years;--all these and all the\r\nothers would behave to you, and you would behave to them, if they could\r\nbe vivified, in ways different individually but real and live.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reality.]\r\n\r\nNow it is beauty of reality as well as of presentation that I at least\r\nfind in _La Morte Amoureuse_. Clarimonde alive is very much more than a\r\n\"shadow on glass\"; Clarimonde dead is more alive than many live women.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And the passion of it.]\r\n\r\nBut the audacity of infatuation need not stop here. I should claim for\r\n_La Morte Amoureuse_, and for Gautier as the author of it, more than\r\nthis. It appears to me to be one of the very few expressions in French\r\nprose of really passionate love. It is, with _Manon Lescaut_ and\r\n_Julie_, the most consummate utterance that I at least know, in that\r\ndivision of literature, of the union of sensual with transcendental\r\nenamourment. Why this is so rare in French is a question fitter for\r\ntreatment in a _History of the French Temperament_ than in one of the\r\nFrench Novel. That it is so I believe to be a simple fact, and simple\r\nfacts require little talking about. No prose literature has so much\r\nlove-making in it as French, and none so much about different species of\r\nlove: _amour de tête_ and _amour des sens_ especially, but also not\r\nunfrequently _amour de coeur_, and even _amour d'âme_. But of the\r\ncombination that _we_ call \"passionate love\"--that fills our own late\r\nsixteenth, early seventeenth, and whole nineteenth century literature,\r\nand that requires love of the heart and the head, the soul and the\r\nsenses, together--it has (outside poetry of course)[202] only the three\r\nbooks just mentioned and a few passages such as Atala's dying speech,\r\nAdolphe's, alas! too soon obliterated reflections on his first success\r\nwith Ellénore, perhaps one or two more before _La Morte Amoureuse_, and\r\neven since its day not many. Maupassant (_v. inf._) _could_ manage the\r\ncombination, but too often confined himself to exhibitions of the\r\nseparate and imperfect divisions, whereof, no doubt, the number is\r\nendless.\r\n\r\nThat Gautier always or often maintained himself at this pitch, either of\r\nwhat we may call power of projecting live personages or of exhibition of\r\ngreat passions, it would be idle and uncritical to contend; that he did\r\nso here, and thereby put himself at once and for ever on the higher,\r\nnay, highest level of literature, I do, after fifty years' study of the\r\nthing and of endless other things, impenitently and impavidly affirm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other short stories.]\r\n\r\nWhat is more, in his shorter productions he was often not far below it,\r\nsave in respect of intensity. If I do not admire _Fortunio_ quite so\r\nmuch as some people do, it is not so much because of its comparative\r\nheartlessness--a thing rare in Gautier--as because for once, and I think\r\nonce only in pieces of its scale, the malt of the description _does_ get\r\nabove the meal of the personal interest, though that personal interest\r\nexists. But _Jettatura_, with its combination of romantic and tragical\r\nappeal; _Avatar_, with its extraordinary mixture of romance, again, with\r\nhumour, its \"excitingness,\" and its delicacy of taste; the equally\r\nextraordinary felicity of the dealings with that too often unmanageable\r\nimplement the \"classical dictionary\" in _Arria Marcella_, _Une Nuit de\r\nCléopâtre_, and perhaps especially _Le Roi Candaule_; the tiny\r\nsketches--half-_nouvelle_ and half-\"middle\" article--of _Le Pied de la\r\nMomie_, _La Pipe d'Opium_, and _Le Club des Haschischins_,--what\r\nmarvellous consummateness in the various specifications and conditions\r\ndo these afford us!\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, I have thought that just as _La Morte Amoureuse_ is\r\nalmost or quite sufficient text for vindicating the greatness or\r\ngreaterness of \"Théo,\" so his earliest book of prose fiction, _Les\r\nJeune-France_, will serve the same purpose for another side of him,\r\nlesser if anybody likes, but exceptionally \"complementary.\" In\r\nparticular it possesses a quality which up to his time was very rare in\r\nFrance, has not been extraordinarily common there even since, and is\r\nstill, even in its ancestral home with ourselves, sometimes\r\ninconceivably blundered about--the quality of Humour.[203]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gautier's humour--_Les Jeune-France_.]\r\n\r\nFor wit, France can, of course, challenge the world; nay, she can do\r\nmore, she can say to the world, \"I have taught you this; and you are no\r\nmatch for your teacher.\" But in Humour the case is notoriously altered.\r\nNone of the Latin nations, except Spain, the least purely Latin of them,\r\nhas ever achieved it, as the original or unoriginal Latins themselves\r\nnever did, with the exception of the lighter forms of it in Catullus, of\r\nthe grimmer in Lucretius--those greatest and most un-Roman of Roman\r\npoets.[204] In all the wide and splendid literature of French before the\r\nnineteenth century only Rabelais and Molière[205] can lay claim to it.\r\nRomanticism brings humour in its train, as Classicism brings wit; but it\r\nis curious how slow was the Romanticisation of French in this respect,\r\nwith one exception. There is no real humour in Hugo, Vigny, George Sand,\r\nBalzac, scarcely even in Musset. Dumas, though showing decidedly good\r\ngifts of possibility in his novels, does not usually require it there;\r\nthe absence of it in his dramas need hardly be dwelt on. Mérimée, one\r\ncannot but think, might have had it if he had chosen; but Mérimée did\r\nnot choose to have so many things! If Gérard de Nerval's failure of a\r\ngreat genius had failed in the comic instead of the romantic-tragical\r\ndirection, he would have had some too--in fact he had it in the\r\nembryonic and unachieved fashion in which the author of _Gaspard de la\r\nNuit_, and Baudelaire, and Paul Verlaine have had it since in verse and\r\nprose. But Gautier has it plump and plain, and without any help from the\r\nstrange counterfeiting fantasy of verse which sometimes confers it. He\r\nhas it always; at all times of his life; in the hackwork which made\r\nabortion of so much greater literature, and in his actually great\r\nliterature, poems, novels, travels--what not. But he never has it more\r\nstrongly, vividly, and originally than in _Les Jeune-France_, a\r\ncoming-of-age book almost as old as _mil-huit-cent-trente_, written in\r\npart no doubt in the immortal _gilet rouge_ itself, if only as kept for\r\nstudy wear like Diderot's old dressing-gown.\r\n\r\nThere are two dangers lying in wait for the reader of the book. One is\r\nthe ordinary and quite respectable putting-out-of-the-lip at its\r\njuvenile improprieties; the other, a little more subtle, is the notion\r\nthat the things, improper or not (and some of them are quite _not_), are\r\nmere _juvenilia_--clever undergraduate work. The first requires no\r\nspecial counterblast; the old monition, \"Don't like it for its\r\nimpropriety, but also don't let its impropriety hide its merits from you\r\nif it has any,\" will suffice. The other is, as has been said, more\r\ninsidious. I can only say that I have read much undergraduate or but\r\nslightly post-graduate literature of many generations--before the day of\r\n_Les Jeune-France_, about its date, between that day and my own season\r\nof passing through those \"sweet hours and the fleetest of time,\" and\r\nsince that season till the present moment. But many equals of this book\r\nI have not read.\r\n\r\nIt is of course necessary to remember that it is expressly subtitled\r\n\"Romans Goguenards,\" thereby preparing the reader for the reverse of\r\nseriousness. That reverse, especially in young hands, is a difficult\r\nthing to manage. \"Guffaw\" and \"yawn\" are two words which have actually\r\ntwo letters in common; _y_ and _g_ are notoriously interchangeable in\r\nsome dialects and circumstances, while _n_ and _u_ are the despair of\r\nthe copyist or the student of copies. There remain only \"ff\"--the\r\nlightest of literals. We need not cite _nominatim_ (indeed it might be\r\nrash) the endless examples in French and English where the guffaw of the\r\nwriter excites the yawn of the reader. But this is hardly ever the case,\r\nat least as I find it, with Gautier.\r\n\r\nThe _Preface_, in which the author presents himself in his unregenerate\r\nand un-\"young-France\" condition, is really a triumph; I wish I could\r\ngive the whole of it here. And what is more, it is a sort of epitome by\r\nanticipation of the entire Gautier, though without, of course, the\r\nmastery of artistry he attained in years of laborious prose and verse.\r\nFor that quality of humour which his younger friend Taine was to define\r\nhappily, though by no means to his own comfort or approval, in the\r\nphrase devoted to one of our English masters of it, \"Il se moque de ses\r\némotions à l'instant même où il s'y livre,\" you must go to Fielding or\r\nto Thackeray to beat it.\r\n\r\nHe (the supposed author) _was_ the most ordinary and insignificant\r\ncreature in the world. He had never either killed a policeman nor\r\ncommitted suicide; he possessed neither pipe, nor dagger, _ni quoi que\r\nce soit qui ait du caractère_. He _did_ like cats (which taste\r\nfortunately remained with Gautier himself throughout his life), and his\r\nreflections on politics had arrived at a final result of zero (another\r\nabiding feature, by the way, with \"Théo\"). He never could learn to play\r\nat cards. He thought artists were merely mountebanks, etc., etc. But\r\nsome kind friends took him in hand and made him an accomplished\r\nJeune-France. He took to himself a very long _nom de guerre_, a very\r\nshort moustache, a middle parting to his hair (the history of the\r\nmiddle parting would be worth writing), and a \"delirious\" waistcoat. He\r\nlearnt to smoke, and to get \"Byronically\" drunk. He bought an Italian\r\nstiletto (by great luck he had a sallow complexion naturally); a silk\r\nrope-ladder (\"which is of the first importance\"); several reams of paper\r\nfor love-letters, and a supply of rose-coloured and avanturine wax.[206]\r\nHe is going to be, if he is not as yet, \"fatal,\" \"vague,\"\r\n\"fallen-angelical,\" \"volcanic.\" There is only one desirable quality\r\nwhich unkind fate has put beyond his reach. He is not, and cannot make\r\nhimself, an illegitimate child! Now, I am sorry for any one who, having\r\nread this, cannot lean back in his chair and follow it up for himself by\r\na series of fancy pictures of Jeunes-something from 1830 to 1918.[207]\r\n\r\nOf the actual stories \"Daniel Jovard\" takes up the cue of the _Preface_\r\ndirectly, and describes the genesis of a _romantique à tous crins_.\r\n\"Onuphrius\" honestly sub-titles itself \"Les Vexations Fantastiques d'un\r\nadmirateur d'Hoffmann,\" and has, I think, sometimes been dismissed as a\r\nHoffmannesque _pastiche_. Far be it from me to hint the slightest\r\ndenigration of the author of the _Phantasiestücke_ and the\r\n_Nachtstücke_, of the _Serapion's-Brüder_ and the _Kater Murr_--not the\r\nleast pleasing features on the right side of the half-glorious,\r\nhalf-ghastly contrast between the Germany of a hundred years ago and the\r\nGermany of to-day. But \"Onuphrius\" is Hoffmann Gautierised, German\r\n\"Franciolated,\" a _Walpurgisnacht_ softened by Morgane la Fée. \"Elias\r\nWildmanstadius,\" one of the earliest, remains one of the most\r\nagreeable, pictures of a fanatic of the mediaeval. The overture and the\r\nfinale, both pieces in which the great motto \"Trinq!\" is perhaps a very\r\nlittle abused, nevertheless contain a considerable amount of wisdom, and\r\nthe last not a little wit.[208] But the central story _Celle-ci et\r\nCelle-là_, which fills nearly half the book, is no doubt the article on\r\nwhich one must--as far as this essay-piece is concerned--judge Gautier's\r\ntale-telling gifts. It is \"improper\" in part; indeed, the thing, which\r\nis largely dialogic, may be thought to have been a young romantic's\r\nchallenge to Crébillon. The points of the contest would require a very\r\ncareful judge to reckon them out. Although Gautier was no democrat, and\r\ncertainly no misogynist, his lady of quality, Madame de M., is terribly\r\nbelow the Crébillonesque Marquises and Célies in every respect, except\r\nthe beauty, which we have to take on trust; while, if she is not quite\r\nsuch a fiend as Laclos's heroine, she is also unlike her in being\r\nstupid. The hero, Rodolphe, though by no means a cad and possessed of\r\nmuch more heart than M. de Clerval or Clitandre, has neither their\r\nmanners nor their wit. But Mariette, the _servante-maîtresse_, though\r\nmuch less moral, is much more attractive than Pamela; the whole of the\r\nstory is hit off with a pleasant mixture of humour, narrative faculty,\r\nbright phrase,[209] and good nature, of which the first is simply absent\r\nin Crébillon and the last rather dubiously present.\r\n\r\nWe may return very shortly to the later, longer, and, I suppose, more\r\naccomplished stories before relinquishing Gautier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Return to _Fortunio_.]\r\n\r\nI have known very good people who liked _Fortunio_; I care for it less\r\nthan for any other of its author's tales. The fabulously rich and\r\nentirely heartless hero has not merely the extravagance but (which is\r\nvery rare with Gautier) the vulgarity of Byronism; the opening orgie,\r\nby an oversight so strange that it may almost seem to be no oversight at\r\nall, reminds one only too forcibly of the ironic treatment accorded to\r\nthat institution in _Les Jeune-France_, and suffers from the\r\nreminder; the blending of East and West and the _Arabian Night_ harems\r\nin Paris, \"unbeknown\" to everybody,[210] almost attain that\r\n_plusquam_-Aristotelian state of reprobation, the impossible which is\r\nalso improbable; and the courtesan heroines--at least two of them,\r\nMusidora and Arabelle--are even more faulty in this respect. No doubt\r\n\r\n    [Greek: pollai morphai tôn ouraniôn],\r\n\r\nand the forms of the Pandemic as well as of the Uranian Aphrodite are\r\nnumerous likewise. But among them one finds no probability or\r\npossibility of Gautier's Musidora of eighteen, who might be a young\r\nduchess gone to the bad. Neither is the end of the girl, suicide, in\r\nconsequence of the disappearance of her lover, though quite possible and\r\neven probable, at all suitable to Gautier's own fashion of thinking and\r\nwriting. Mérimée could have done it perfectly well. Of almost no others\r\nof the delectable contents of the two volumes of _Nouvelles_ and of\r\n_Romans et Contes_ has one to speak in this fashion, while some of them\r\ncome very nearly up to their companion _La Morte Amoureuse_ itself.\r\n\r\nHow Gautier managed to keep all this comparatively serious, if not quite\r\nso, in treatment, is perhaps less difficult to make out than why he took\r\nthe trouble to do so. But it is the entire absences of irony on the one\r\nside and on the other of the dream-quality--the pure imagination which\r\nmakes the impossibilities of _La Morte_ and of _Arria Marcella_, and\r\neven of the trifle _Omphale_, so delightful--that deprives _Fortunio_ of\r\nattraction in my eyes. Such faint glimmerings of it as there are are\r\nconfined to two very minor characters:--one of the courtesans, Cinthia,\r\na beautiful statuesque Roman, who has simplified the costume-problem by\r\nwearing nothing--literally nothing--except one of two dresses, one black\r\nvelvet and the other white watered silk; and the \"Count George\" (we are\r\nnever told his surname), who gives the overture-orgie. One might, as the\r\nlady said to Professor Wilson in regard to the _Noctes_, say to him, \"I\r\nreally think you eat too many oysters, and drink too much [not indeed in\r\nhis case] whisky,\" and I can find no excuse for his deliberately\r\nupsetting an enormous bowl of flaming arrack punch on a floor swept by\r\nwomen's dresses. But he is quite human, and he makes the best speech and\r\nscene in the book when he remonstrates with Musidora for secluding\r\nherself because she cannot discover the elusive marquis-rajah\r\ntiger-keeper,--and, I fear I must add, \"tiger\" himself,--from whom the\r\nthing takes its title.[211]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And others.]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, almost worth while to go through the freak-splendours\r\nand transformation-scene excitements of _Fortunio_ to prepare the\r\npalate[212] to enjoy _La Toison d'Or_ which follows. Here is once more\r\nthe true Gautieresque humour, good humour, marvellous word-painting, and\r\nromance, agreeably--indeed charmingly--twisted together. There is no\r\nfairy-story transposed into a modern and probable key which surpasses\r\nthis of the painter Tiburce; and the disorderly curios of his rooms; and\r\nhis sudden and heroic determination to fall desperately in love with a\r\nblonde; and his setting off to Flanders to find one; and the\r\nfruitlessness of his search and his bewitchment with the Magdalen in the\r\n\"Descent from the Cross\" at Antwerp (ah! what has become of it?); and\r\nhis casual discovery and courtship of a girl like that celestial\r\nconvertite; and her sorrow when she finds that she is only a substitute;\r\nand her victory by persuading her lover to paint her _as_ the Magdalen\r\nand so work off the witchery.[213] Of course some one may shrug\r\nshoulders and murmur, \"Always the _berquinade_?\" But I do not think _La\r\nMorte Amoureuse_ was a _berquinade_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Longer books, _Le Capitaine Fracasse_ and others.]\r\n\r\nOf Gautier's longer books it is not necessary to say much, because, with\r\nperhaps one exception, they are admittedly not his forte.[214] Of the\r\nlongest, _Le Capitaine Fracasse_, I am myself very fond. Its opening and\r\nfirst published division, _Le Château de la Misère_, is one of the\r\nfinest pieces of description in the whole range of the French novel; and\r\nthere are many interesting scenes, especially the great duel of the hero\r\nSigognac with the bravo Lampourde. But some make it a reproach, not, I\r\nthink, of very damaging validity, that so much of the book is little\r\nmore than a \"study off\" the _Roman Comique_;[215] and it is, though not\r\nexactly a reproach, a great misfortune that in time, kind, and almost\r\neverything else it enters into competition with Dumas, whose gifts as a\r\nmanager of such things were as much above Gautier's as his powers as a\r\nwriter were below Théo's. _Le Roman de la Momie_, though possessing the\r\nabiding talisman of style, suffers in the first place from being mere\r\nEgyptology novelised, and in the second from the same thing having been\r\ndone, on a scale much better suited to the author, in _Le Pied de la\r\nMomie_. Nor are _Spirite_ and _Militona_ free from parallel charges:\r\nwhile _La Belle Jenny_--that single and unfortunate appeal to the\r\n_abonné_ noted above--really may fail to amuse those who are not \"irked\r\nby the style.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mlle. de Maupin._]\r\n\r\nThere remains the most notorious and the most abused of all Gautier's\r\nwork, _Mademoiselle de Maupin_. Perhaps here also, as in the case of _La\r\nMorte Amoureuse_, I cannot do better than simply reprint, with very\r\nslight addition, what I said of the book nearly forty years ago. For the\r\ncase is a peculiar one, and I have made no change in my own estimate,\r\nthough I think the inclusion of the _Preface_--not because I agree with\r\nit any less--more dubious than I did then. In this _Preface_ the\r\ndoctrine of \"art for art's sake\" and of its consequent independence of\r\nany _licet_ or _non-licet_ from morality is put with great ability and\r\nno little cogency, but in a fashion essentially juvenile, from its want\r\nof measure and its evident wish to provoke as much as to prove.[216]\r\nWithout it the book would probably have excited far less odium and\r\nopprobrium than it has actually done; it would, if separate, be an\r\nexcellent critical essay on the general subject; while in its actual\r\nposition it almost subjects the text to the curse of purpose, from which\r\nnothing which claims to be art ought (according to the doctrine of both\r\npreface and book) to be more free.\r\n\r\nWith the novel itself it is difficult to deal in the way of abstract and\r\noccasional excerpt, not merely because of its breaches of the\r\nproprieties, but on account of the plan on which it is written. A\r\nmixture of letters and narrative,[217] dealing almost entirely with\r\nemotions, and scarcely at all with incidents, it defies narrative\r\nanalysis such as that which was given to its elder sister in\r\nnaughtiness, _La Religieuse_. It would seem that Goethe, who in many\r\nways influenced Gautier, is responsible to some extent for its form, and\r\nperhaps for the fact that _As You Like It_ plays an even more important\r\npart in it than _Hamlet_ plays in _Wilhelm Meister_. No one who has read\r\nit can fail thenceforward to associate a new charm with the image of\r\nRosalind, even though she be one of Shakespeare's most gracious\r\ncreations; and this I know is a bold word. But, in truth, it is in more\r\nways than one an unspeakable book. Those who like may point to a couple\r\nof pages of loose description at the end, a dialogue in the style of a\r\npolite _Jacques le Fataliste_ in the middle, a dozen phrases of a\r\nhazardous character scattered here and there. Diderot himself--no\r\nstrait-laced judge, indeed _particeps ejusdem criminis_--remarked long\r\nago, and truly enough, that errors of this sort punish themselves by\r\nrestricting the circulation, and diminishing the chance of life of the\r\nbook, or other work, that contains them. But it is not these things that\r\nthe admirers of _Mademoiselle de Maupin_ admire. It is the wonderful and\r\nfinal expression, repeated, but subtly shaded and differenced, in the\r\nthree characters of Albert, Rosette, and Madeleine herself, of the\r\naspiration which, as I have said, colours Gautier's whole work. If he,\r\nas has been justly remarked, was the priest of beauty, _Mademoiselle de\r\nMaupin_ is certainly one of the sacred books of the cult. The apostle to\r\nwhom it was revealed was young, and perhaps he has mingled words of clay\r\nwith words of gold. It would be difficult to find a Bowdler for this\r\nMadeleine, and impossible to adapt her to the use of families. But those\r\nwho understand as they read, and can reject the evil and hold fast the\r\ngood, who desire sometimes to retire from the meditation of the weary\r\nways of ordinary life to the land of clear colours and stories, where\r\nthere is none of this weariness, who are not to be scared by the poet's\r\nharmless puppets or tempted by his guileless baits--they at least will\r\ntake her as she is and be thankful.[218]\r\n\r\nStill, as has been said, the book might have been made still better by\r\nbeing cut down a little; not, indeed, to the dimensions of a very short\r\nstory, but to something like those of _Fortunio_ or of _Jettatura_. For\r\nundoubtedly, while Gautier had an all but unsurpassed command of the\r\nshort story proper, a really long one was apt to develop some things in\r\nhim which, if they were not essentially faults, were not likely to\r\nimprove a full-sized novel. He would too much abound in description; the\r\nwant of _evolution_ of character--his character is not bad in itself,\r\nbut it is, to use modern slang, rather static than dynamic--naturally\r\nshows itself more; and readers who want an elaborate plot look for it\r\nlonger and are more angry at not being fed. But for the short, shorter,\r\nand shortest kind--the story which may run from ten to a hundred pages\r\nwith no meticulous limitations on either side--it seems to me that in\r\nthe French nineteenth century there are only three other persons who can\r\nbe in any way classed with him. One of these, his early contemporary,\r\nCharles de Bernard, and another, who only became known after his death,\r\nGuy de Maupassant, are to be treated in other chapters here. Moreover,\r\nBernard was slighter, though not so slight as he has sometimes been\r\nthought; and Maupassant, though very far from slight, had a _lésion_ (as\r\nhis own school would say) which interfered with universality. The third\r\ncompetitor, not yet named, who was Gautier's almost exact contemporary,\r\nthough he began a very little earlier and left off a little earlier too,\r\ncarried metal infinitely heavier than the pleasant author of _Le\r\nParatonnerre_, and though not free from partly disabling prejudices, had\r\nmore balance[219] than Maupassant. He had more head and less heart, more\r\nprose logic and less poetical fancy, more actuality and less dream than\r\n\"Théo.\" But I at least can find no critical abacus on which, by totting\r\nup the values of both, I can make one greatly outvalue the other. And to\r\nthe understanding I must have already spoken the name of Prosper\r\nMérimée.[220]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mérimée.]\r\n\r\nAll the world knows _Carmen_, though it may be feared that the knowledge\r\nhas been conveyed to more people by the mixed and inferior medium of\r\nthe stage and music than by the pure literature of the original tale.\r\nYet it may be generously granted that the lower introduction may have\r\ninduced some to go on, or back, to the higher. Of the unfaulty\r\nfaultlessness of that original there has never been any denial worth\r\nlistening to; the gainsayers having been persons who succumbed either to\r\nnon-literary prejudice[221] of one kind or another or to the peculiarly\r\nchildish habit of going against established opinion. For combined\r\ninterest of matter and perfection of form I should put it among the\r\ndozen best short stories of the world so far as I am acquainted with\r\nthem. The appendix about the gipsies is indeed a superfluity,\r\ninduced, it would seem, partly by Mérimée's wish to have a gibe at\r\nBorrow for being a missionary, and partly by a touch of\r\ninspectorial-professorial[222] habit in him which is frequently apparent\r\nand decidedly curious. But it is an appendix of the most appendicious,\r\nand can be cut away without the slightest Manx-cat effect. From the\r\nstory itself not a word could be abstracted without loss nor one added\r\nto it without danger. The way in which the narrator--it is impossible to\r\ntell the number of the authors who have wrecked themselves over the\r\nnarrator when he has to take part in the action--and the guide are put\r\nand kept in their places, as well as the whole part of José Navarro, are\r\n_impayables_. If the Hispanolatry of French Romanticism had nothing but\r\nGastibelza and L'Andalouse in verse and José Navarro in prose to show,\r\nit would stand justified and crowned among all the literary manias in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carmen.]\r\n\r\nAbout Carmen herself there has been more--and may justly be a little\r\nmore--question. Is her _diablúra_ slightly exaggerated? Or, to put the\r\ncomplaint in a more accurately critical form, has Mérimée attended a\r\nlittle too much to the task of throwing on the canvas a typical Rommany\r\n_chi_ or _callee_, and a little too little to that of bodying forth a\r\nprobable and individual human girl? As an advocate I think I could take\r\na brief on either side of the question without scandalising the, on this\r\npoint, almost neurotic conscience of the late Mr. Anthony Trollope. But,\r\nas a juryman, my verdict on either indictment would be \"Not guilty, and\r\n_please_ do it again.\"\r\n\r\nBut I had much rather decline both functions and all litigious\r\nproceedings, and go from the courts of law to the cathedral of\r\nliterature and thank the Lord thereof for this wonderful triumph of\r\nletters. And, in the same way, if any quarrelsome person says, \"But only\r\na few pages back you were in parallel ecstasies about _La Morte\r\nAmoureuse_,\" I decline the daggers. Each is supreme in its kind, though\r\nthe kinds are different. Of each it may be said, \"It cannot be better\r\ndone,\" but there may be--in fact there is nearly sure to be--something\r\nin the individual taste of each reader which will make the appeal of one\r\nto his heart, if not to his head, more intimate and welcome. That has\r\nnothing to do with their general literary value, which in each case is\r\nconsummate. And happy are those who can appreciate both.\r\n\r\nConsummateness, in the various kinds, is, indeed, the mark of Mérimée's\r\nstories. The variety is greater than in those of Gautier, because, just\r\nas \"Théo\" had the advantage of Prosper in point of poetry, he had a\r\ncertain disadvantage in point of range of intellect, or, to prevent\r\nmistake, let us say interest--which perhaps is only another _tropos_ (as\r\nthe Greeks would have said and as the chemists in a very limited sense\r\ndo say after them) of the same thing. Beauty was Gautier's only idol;\r\nMérimée had more of a pantheon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Colomba._]\r\n\r\nAs to _Colomba_ compared with _Carmen_, there is, I believe, a sort of\r\nsectarianism among Prosperites. I hope I am, as always, catholic. I do\r\nnot know that, in the terms of classical scholarship, it is \"castigated\"\r\nto the same extent as its rival in point of superfluities. Not that I\r\nwish anything away from it; but I think a few things might be away\r\nwithout loss--which is not the case with _Carmen_. Yet, on the other\r\nhand, the danger of the type seems to me more completely avoided.[223]\r\nAt any rate, my admiration for the book is not in any way bribed by that\r\nRossetti portrait of a Corsican lady to which I have referred above. For\r\nthough she certainly _is_ Colomba, I never saw the face till\r\nyears--almost decades--after I knew the story.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its smaller companions--_Mateo Falcone_, etc.]\r\n\r\nBut of the smaller tales which usually accompany her, who shall\r\nexaggerate the praise? _Mateo Falcone_, that modern Roman father (by the\r\nway, there is said to be more Roman blood in Corsica than in any part of\r\nthe mainland of Italy, and the portrait above mentioned is almost pure\r\nFaustina), is another of those things which are _à prendre ou à\r\nlaisser_. It could not, again, be better done; and if any one will\r\ncompare it with the somewhat similar anecdote of lynch-law in Balzac's\r\n_Les Chouans_, he ought to recognise the fact--good as that also is.\r\n_Les Âmes du Purgatoire_ is also \"first choice.\" Of what may be called\r\nthe satellites of the great _Don Juan_ story--satellites with a nebula\r\ninstead of a planet for their centre--it is quite the greatest. But of\r\nthis group _La Vénus d'Ille_ is my favourite, perhaps for a rather\r\nillegitimate reason. That reason is the possibility of comparing it with\r\nMr. Morris's _Ring given to Venus_--a handling of the same subject in\r\npoetry instead of in prose, with a happy ending instead of an unhappy\r\none, and pure Romantic in every respect instead of, as _La Vénus d'Ille_\r\nis, late classical, with a strong Romantic _nisus_.[224]\r\n\r\nFor, though it might be improper here to argue out the matter, these\r\nlast words can be fitted to Mérimée's _ethos_ from the days of \"Clara\r\nGazul\" and \"Hyacinthe Maglanovich\" to those when he wrote _Lokis_ and\r\n_La Chambre Bleue_. A deserter from Romanticism he was never; a Romantic\r\nfree-lance (after being an actual Romantic pioneer) with a strong\r\nClassical element in him he was always.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Those of _Carmen_; _Arsène Guillot_.]\r\n\r\nThe almost unavoidable temptation of taking _Colomba_ and _Carmen_\r\ntogether has drawn us away from the companions, as they are usually\r\ngiven, of the Spanish story among Mérimée's earlier works. More than\r\ntwo-thirds of the volume, as most people have seen it, consist of\r\ntranslations from the Russian of Poushkin and Gogol, which need no\r\nnotice here. But _Arsène Guillot_ and _L'Abbé Aubain_, the two pieces\r\nwhich immediately follow _Carmen_, can by no means be passed over. If\r\n(as one may fairly suppose, without being quite certain) the selection\r\nof these for juxtaposition was authentic and deliberate, it was\r\ncertainly judicious. They might have been written as a trilogy, not of\r\nsequence, but of contrast--a demonstration of power in essentially\r\ndifferent forms of subject. _Arsène Guillot_, like _Carmen_, is tragedy;\r\nbut it is _tragédie bourgeoise_ or _sentimentale_. There are no daggers\r\nor musquetoons, and though (since the heroine throws herself out of a\r\nwindow) there is some blood, she dies of consumption, not of her wounds.\r\nShe is only a _grisette_ who has lost her looks, the one lover she ever\r\ncared for, and her health; while the other characters of importance\r\n(Mérimée has taken from the stock-cupboard one of the cynical,\r\nrough-mannered, but really good-natured doctors common in French and not\r\nunknown in English literature) are the lover or gallant himself, Max de\r\nSaligny (quite a good fellow and perfectly willing, though he had tired\r\nof Arsène, to have succoured her had he known her distress), and the\r\nLady Bountiful, Madame de Piennes. How a \"triangle\" is established\r\nnobody versed in novels needs to be told, though everybody, however well\r\nversed, should be glad to read. Arsène of course must die; what the\r\nothers who lived did with their lives is left untold. The thing is quite\r\nunexciting, but is done with the author's miraculous skill; nor perhaps\r\nis there any piece that better shows his faculty of writing like the\r\n\"gentleman,\"[225] which, according to a famous contrast, he was, on a\r\nsubject almost equally liable to more or less vulgar Paul-de-Kockery, to\r\nsloppy sentimentalism, and to cheap cynical journalese.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And _L'Abbé Aubain_.]\r\n\r\nAs for _L'Abbé Aubain_, it is slight but purely comic, of the very best\r\ncomedy, telling how a great lady, obliged by pecuniary misfortunes to\r\nretire with her husband to a remote country house, takes a fancy to, and\r\nimagines she has possibly excited fatal passion in, the local priest;\r\nattributes to him a sentimental past; but half good-naturedly, half\r\nvirtuously obtains for him a comfortable town-cure in order to remove\r\nhim, and perhaps herself, from temptation. This moving tale of\r\nself-denial and of averted sorrow, sin, and perhaps tragedy, is told in\r\nletters to another lady. Then follows a single epistle from the Abbé\r\nhimself to his old Professor of Theology, telling, with the utmost\r\nbrevity and matter-of-factness, how glad he is to make the exchange,\r\nwhat a benevolent nuisance the patroness has been, and how he looks\r\nforward to meeting the Professor in his new parsonage, with a plump\r\nchicken and a bottle of old bordeaux between them. There is hardly\r\nanywhere a better bit of irony of the lighter kind. It is rather like\r\nCharles de Bernard, with the higher temper and brighter flash of\r\nMérimée's style.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Prise de la Redoute._]\r\n\r\nAll the stories just noticed, except _Carmen_ itself (which is of 1847),\r\nappeared originally in the decade 1830-40, as well as others of less\r\nnote, and one wonderful little masterpiece, which deserves notice by\r\nitself. This is _La Prise de la Redoute_, a very short thing--little\r\nmore than an anecdote--of one of the \"furious five minutes,\" or hours,\r\nnot unknown in all great wars, and seldom better known than in that of\r\nthese recent years, despite the changes of armament and tactics. It is\r\nalmost sufficient to say of it that no one who has the slightest\r\ncritical faculty can fail to see its consummateness, and that any one\r\nwho does not see or will not acknowledge that consummateness may make up\r\nhis mind to one thing--that he is not, and--but by some marvellous\r\nexertion of the grace of God--never will be, a critic. He may have in\r\nhim the elements of a capital convict or a faithful father of a family;\r\nhe may be a poet--poets, though sometimes very good, have sometimes been\r\nvery bad critics--or a painter, or a philosopher, as distinguished as\r\nany of those whose names the Bertram girls learnt; or an elect\r\ncandlestick-maker, fit to be an elder of any Little Bethel. But of\r\ncriticism he can have no jot or tittle, no trace or germ. The question\r\nis, for once, not one of anything that can be called merely or mainly\r\n\"taste.\" A man who is not a hopelessly bad critic, though he may not\r\nhave in him the _catholicon_ of critical goodness, may fail to\r\nappreciate _La Morte Amoureuse_ because of its dreaminess and\r\nsupernaturality and all-for-loveness; _Carmen_ because Carmen shocks\r\nhim; _La Venus d'Ille_ because of its _macabre_ tone; _Les Jeune-France_\r\nbecause of their _goguenarderie_ or _goguenardise_. But the case of the\r\n_Redoute_ is one of those rare instances where the intellect and the\r\naesthetic sense approach closest--almost merge into each other,--as,\r\nindeed, they did in Mérimée himself. The principles as well as the\r\npractice of narrative are here at once reduced to their lowest and\r\nexalted to their highest terms. The thing is not merely fermented but\r\ndistilled; not so much a fact as a formula, with a formula's precision\r\nbut without its dryness. If we take the familiar trichotomy of body,\r\nsoul, and spirit and apply it to subject, style, and narrative power in\r\na story, we shall find them all perfectly achieved and perfectly wedded\r\nhere.[226]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Dernières Nouvelles_; _Il Viccolo di Madama Lucrezia_.]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time as that at which _Carmen_ was published (indeed a\r\nyear earlier) Mérimée wrote a shorter, but not very short story, _Il\r\nViccolo di Madama Lucrezia_, which for some reason only appeared, at\r\nleast in book form, long after, with the _Dernières Nouvelles_ and\r\nposthumously. It is, I think, his one attempt in the explained[227]\r\nsupernatural--a kind for which I have myself no very great affection.\r\nBut it is extremely well done, and if there are some suggestions of\r\nimpropriety in it, Hymen, to use Paul de Kock's phrase (it is really\r\npleasant to think of Paul and Prosper--the farthest opposites of French\r\ncontemporary novel-craft--together), covers up the more recent of them\r\nwith his mantle.\r\n\r\nBut some at least of the other contents of the same volume are worthy of\r\ngreater praise. One, _Le Coup de Pistolet_, is a translation from\r\nPoushkin; another, _Federigo_, an agreeable version of an Italian\r\nfolk-tale--one of the numerous legends in which a 'cute' and not\r\nunkindly sinner escapes not only perdition, but Purgatory, and takes\r\nParadise by storm of wit.[228] A third piece, _Les Sorcières\r\nEspagnoles_, is folklorish in a way likewise, but inferior.\r\n\r\nYet another trio remains, and its constituents, _Lokis_, _La Chambre\r\nBleue_, and _Djoumane_, are among Mérimée's greatest triumphs.\r\n_Djoumane_ is not dated; the other two date from the very last years of\r\nhis life and of the Second Empire; and, unless I mistake, were written\r\ndirectly to amuse that Imperial Majesty who lives yet, and who, as all\r\ngood men must hope, may live to see the _revanche_, if not of the\r\ndynasty, at any rate of the country, which she did so much to adorn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Djoumane._]\r\n\r\nOf the three, _Djoumane_--the account of a riding dream during a\r\ncampaign in Algeria--is the slightest, no doubt, and to a certain extent\r\na \"trick\" story. But it has the usual Mériméan consummateness in its own\r\nway; and I can give it one testimonial which, like all testimonials, no\r\ndoubt depends on the importance of the giver, but which, to that\r\nextent, is solid. I have read dozens, scores, almost hundreds of\r\ndream-stories. I cannot remember a single one, except this, which \"took\r\nme in\" almost to the very awaking.\r\n\r\nThere is no trick in either of the others, though in one of them there\r\nis the supernatural--_not_ explained. But they are examples--closely and\r\nno doubt intentionally juxtaposed--in two different kinds, both of them\r\nexceptionally difficult and dangerous: the story of more or less\r\nordinary life, with only a few suggestions of anything else, which\r\nresolves itself into horrible tragedy; and the story, again of ordinary\r\nlife, with a tragic suggestion in the middle, which unknits itself into\r\npure comedy at the end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Lokis._]\r\n\r\n_Lokis_ is a story of lycanthropy, or rather _arct_anthropy. A\r\nLithuanian Count's mother has been carried off, soon after her marriage,\r\nby a bear, and just rescued with a lucky shot at the monster. She goes,\r\nas is not very wonderful, quite mad, does not recover when her child is\r\nborn, and is under restraint in her own house, as wife and widow, for\r\nthe term of her life. Her son, however, shows no overt symptoms of\r\nanything wrong except fits of melancholy and seclusion, being in other\r\nrespects a gentleman of most excellent \"havings\"--handsome, brave,\r\nsportsmanlike, familiar with the best European society, and even\r\nsomething of a scholar. He entertains a German minister and professor,\r\nwhose special forte is Lithuanian, in order that the pundit may study\r\nsome rare books and MSS. in his library; and his guest, being a great\r\ntraveller, a good rider, and, though simple in his ways, not at all\r\nunlike a man of this world, makes a friend of him. It so happens, too,\r\nthat they have a common acquaintance--a neighbour, and, as is soon seen,\r\nan idol of the Count's, Mademoiselle Julie Ivinska, very pretty, very\r\nmerry, and, if not very wise, clever enough to take in the scholar, on\r\nhis own ground, with a vernacular (\"jmoude\") version of one of\r\nMickiewitz's poems. All goes well in a way, except for occasional\r\napparitions of the poor mad Countess; but there is a rather threatening\r\nepisode of a ride into a great forest, which is popularly supposed to\r\ncontain a \"sanctuary of the beasts,\" impenetrable by any hunter, and in\r\nwhich they actually meet a local sorceress, with a basket of poisonous\r\nmushrooms and a tame snake in it. Another episode gives us odd comments,\r\nand a sort of nightmare afterwards, of the Count, when his guest happens\r\nto mention the blood-drinking habits of the South American gauchos, in\r\nwhich the professor himself has been forced to take part.\r\n\r\nBut these things and other \"lights\" of the catastrophe are very\r\nartistically kept down, and you are never nudged or winked at in the\r\noffensive \"please note\" manner. The guest goes away, but, not much to\r\nanybody's surprise, is very soon asked to return and celebrate the\r\nwedding of the Count and Mlle. Ivinska, who are both Lutherans. He goes,\r\nand finds a great semi-pagan feast of the local peasantry (which does\r\nnot much please him) and one or two bad omens, including an appearance\r\nof the mad old Countess with evil words, which please him still less.\r\nBut the feast ends at last and the newly married couple retire, there\r\nbeing, of course, no \"going away.\" Early in the morning the pastor is\r\nwaked by the sound of a heavy body (a sound which he had noticed before\r\nbut never interpreted) clambering down a tree just outside his window. A\r\nlittle later, as the bridal pair do not appear, their door is broken\r\nopen, and the new Countess is found alone, dead, drenched in blood, and\r\nher throat, not cut, but _bitten_ through.\r\n\r\nThe whole story is told by the minister himself to an otherwise\r\nunidentified Theodore and Adelaide (who may be anybody, but who adroitly\r\nsoften the conclusion), and with that consummate management of the\r\ndifficult part of actor-narrator which has been noted. In every respect\r\nbut the purely sentimental one it seems to me beyond reproach and almost\r\nbeyond praise.[229]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Chambre Bleue._]\r\n\r\nThere could not, as has been said, be a greater contrast than _La\r\nChambre Bleue_ in everything but craftsmanship. Two lovers (being French\r\nthey have to be unlawful lovers, but the story would be neither injured\r\nnor improved, as a story, if the relation were taken quite out of the\r\nreach of the Divorce and Admiralty division, as it could be by a very\r\nlittle ingenuity) meet, in slight disguise,[230] at a railway station to\r\nspend \"a day and a night and a morrow\" together at a country hotel--not\r\na great way from Paris, but outside the widest _banlieue_. They meet and\r\nstart all right; but Fortune begins, almost at once, to play them\r\ntricks. They are not, as of course they wish to be, alone in the\r\ncarriage. A third traveller (one knows the wretch) gets in at the last\r\nmoment, and when, not to waste too much time, they begin to make love in\r\nEnglish, he very properly tells them that he is an Englishman, assuring\r\nthem, however, that he is probably going to sleep, and in any case will\r\nnot attend to anything they say. Then he takes a Greek book from his\r\nbag, and devotes himself first to it and then to slumber. When their\r\njourney comes to an end, so does his, and he goes to the same hotel, but\r\nnot before he has had an angry interview on the platform with some one\r\nwho calls him \"uncle.\" However, at the moment this does not matter much.\r\nStill, the _guignon_ is on them; their _chambre bleue_ is between two\r\nother rooms, and--as is the common habit of French hotels and the not\r\nuncommon one of English--has doors to both, which, though they can be\r\nfastened, by no means exclude sound. One of the next rooms is the\r\nEnglishman's; the other, unfortunately, is a large upper chamber, in\r\nwhich the officers of a departing regiment are entertaining their\r\nsuccessors. They are very noisy, very late, and somewhat impertinent\r\nwhen asked not to disturb their neighbours; but they break up at last,\r\nand the lovers have, as the poet says, \"moonlight [actually] and sleep\r\n[possibly] for repayment.\" But with the morning a worse thing happens.\r\nThe lover, waking, sees at the foot of the bed, flowing sluggishly from\r\nthe crack under the Englishman's door, a dark brownish-red fluid. It is\r\nblood, certainly blood! and what on earth is to be done? Apparently the\r\nEnglishman (they have heard a heavy bump in the night) has either\r\ncommitted suicide or been murdered, perhaps by the nephew; the matter\r\nwill be enquired into; in the circumstances they themselves cannot\r\nescape examination, and the escapade will come out (blue spectacles and\r\nblack veils being alike useless against Commissaries of Police and\r\nJudges of Instruction). The only hope is an early Paris train, if they\r\ncan get their bill, obtain some sort of breakfast, and catch it. But,\r\njust as they have determined to do so, the facts next door are\r\ndiscovered. The Englishman, who has ordered two bottles of _porto_, has\r\nfallen asleep over the second, knocked it down while still half-full,\r\nfollowed it himself to the floor, and reclined there peacefully, while\r\nthe fluid from the broken bottle trickled over the boards,[231] under\r\nthe door, and into the agapemone beyond. Once more (but for one\r\nhorrible[232] piece of libel), the thing could hardly be better.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Chronique de Charles IX._]\r\n\r\nMérimée's largest and most ambitious attempt at pure prose fiction--the\r\n_Chronique de Charles IX_--has been rather variously judged. That the\r\npresent writer once translated the whole of it may, from different\r\npoints of view, be regarded as a qualification and a disqualification\r\nfor judging it afresh. For a mere amateur (and there are\r\nunfortunately[233] only too many amateur translators) it might be one\r\nor the other, according as the executant had been pleased or bored by\r\nhis occupation. But to a person used to the manner, something of an\r\nexpert in literary criticism, and brought by the writing of many books\r\nto an even keel between _engouement_ and disgust, it certainly should\r\nnot be a _dis_qualification. I do not think that the _Chronique_, as a\r\nromance of the Dumas kind, though written long before Dumas so\r\nfortunately deserted the drama for the kind itself, is entirely a\r\nsuccess. It has excellent characters, if not in the actual hero, in his\r\ntwo Dalilahs--the camp-follower girl, who is a sort of earlier Carmen,\r\nand the great lady--and in his fear-neither-God-nor-Devil brother; good\r\nscenes in the massacre and in other passages also. But as a whole--as a\r\nmodernised _roman d'adventures_--it does not exactly _run_: the reader\r\ndoes not devour the story as he should. He may be--I am--delighted with\r\nthe way in which the teller tells; but the things which he tells are of\r\nmuch less interest. One cannot exactly say with that acute critic (if\r\nrather uncritical acceptor of the accomplished facts of life and death\r\nand matrimony), Queen Gertrude of Denmark, \"More matter with less art,\"\r\nfor there is plenty of matter as well as amply sufficient and yet not\r\nover-lavish art. But one is not made to take sufficient interest in the\r\nparticular matter supplied.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The semi-dramatic stories. _La Jacquerie._]\r\n\r\nThe other considerable and early attempt in historical romance, _La\r\nJacquerie_, is not in pure novel form, but it may fitly introduce some\r\nnotice of its actual method, in which Mérimée frequently, Gautier more\r\nthan once, and a third eminent man of letters to be noticed presently\r\nmost of all, distinguished themselves. This was what, in Old French,\r\nwould have been called the story _par personnages_--the manner in which\r\nthe whole matter is conveyed, not by _récit_, not by the usual form of\r\nmixed narrative and conversation, but by dramatic or semi-dramatic\r\ndialogue only, with action and stage direction, but no connecting\r\nlanguage of the author to the reader. The early French mysteries and\r\nmiracles--still more the farces--were not altogether unlike this; we saw\r\nthat some of the curious intermediate work of the late sixteenth and\r\nearly seventeenth centuries took it, and that both of Crébillon's most\r\nfelicitous, if not most edifying exercises are in dialogue form. The\r\nadmiration of the French Romantics for the \"accidented\" and \"matterful\"\r\nEnglish, Spanish, and German drama naturally encouraged experiment in\r\nthis kind. Gautier has not very much of it, though there is some in _Les\r\nJeune-France_, and his charming ballets might be counted in. But Mérimée\r\nwas particularly addicted thereto. _La Jacquerie_ is injured to some\r\ntastes by excessive indulgence in the grime and horror which the subject\r\nno doubt invited. We do not all rejoice in the notion of a Good Friday\r\nservice, \"extra-illustrated\" by a real crucifixion alive of a generous\r\nJacques who has surrendered himself; or in violence offered (it is true,\r\nwith the object of securing marriage) to a French heiress by an English\r\ncaptain of Free Companions. Even some of those who may not dislike these\r\ntouches of _haut goût_, may, from the coolest point of view of strict\r\ncriticism, say that the composition is too _décousu_, and that, as in\r\nthe _Chronique_, there is little actual interest of story. But the\r\nphantasmagoria of gloom and blood and fire is powerfully presented. The\r\nearlier _Théâtre de Clara Gazul_,[234] one of the boldest and most\r\nsuccessful of all literary mystifications, belongs more or less to the\r\nsame class, which Mérimée never entirely deserted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Carrosse du Saint-Sacrement_, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe best of all these is, to my thinking, undoubtedly the _Carrosse du\r\nSaint-Sacrement_. It is also, I believe, the only one that ever was\r\ntried on the actual stage--it is said without success--though surely\r\nthis cannot have been the form that it took in _La Périchole_, not the\r\nleast amusing of those levities of Offenbach's which did so disgust the\r\nPharisees of academic music and so arride the guileless public. _Le\r\nCarrosse_ itself is a charming thing--very, very merry and by no means\r\nunwise--without a drop of bad blood in it, and, if no better than, very\r\nnearly as good as it should be from the moral point of view. _La Famille\r\nCarvajal_ has the same fault of gruesomeness as _La Jacquerie_, with\r\nless variety, and _Une Femme est un Diable_, a fresh handling of\r\nsomething like the theme of _Le Diable Amoureux_ and _The Monk_, if\r\nbetter than Lewis, is not so good as Cazotte. But _L'Occasion_ is almost\r\ngreat, and I think _Le Ciel et l'Enfer_ absolutely deserves that too\r\nmuch lavished ticket. Indeed Doña Urraca in this, like La Périchole in\r\n_Le Carrosse_, seems to me to put Mérimée among the greatest masters of\r\nfeminine character in the nineteenth century, and far above some others\r\nwho have been held to have reached that perilous position.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this hybrid form between _nouvelle_ and _drame_ has\r\nsome illegitimate advantages. You can, some one has said, \"insinuate\r\ncharacter,\" whereas in a regular story you have to delineate it; and\r\nthough in some modern instances critics have seemed disposed to put a\r\nhigher price on the insinuation than on the delineation, not merely in\r\nthis particular form, I cannot quite agree with them. All the same,\r\nMérimée's accomplishments in this mixed kind are a great addition to his\r\nachievements in the story proper, and, as has been confessed before, I\r\nshould be slow to deny him the place of the greatest \"little master\" in\r\nfiction all round, though I may like some little masterpieces of others\r\nbetter than any of his.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Musset: charm of his dramatised stories; his pure narration\r\nunsuccessful.]\r\n\r\nBy an interesting but not at all inexplicable contrast the only writer\r\nof prose fiction (except those to whom separate chapters have been\r\nallotted and one other who follows him here) to be in any way classed\r\nwith Mérimée and Gautier as a man of letters generally--Alfred de\r\nMusset--displays the contrast of values in his work of narrative and\r\ndramatic form in exactly the opposite way to (at least) Mérimée's.\r\nMusset's _Proverbes_, though, I believe, not quite successful at first,\r\nhave ever since been the delight of all but vulgar stage-goers: they\r\nhave, from the very first, been the delight of all but vulgar readers\r\nfor their pure story interest. Even some poems, not given as intended\r\ndramas at all, possess the most admirable narrative quality and\r\nstory-turn.\r\n\r\nAs for the _Comédies-Proverbes_, it is impossible for the abandoned\r\nreader of plays who reads them either as poems or as stories, or as\r\nboth, to go wrong there, whichever of the delightful bunch he takes up.\r\nTo play upon some of their own titles--you are never so safe in swearing\r\nas when you swear that they are charming; when the door of the library\r\nthat contains them is opened you may think yourself happy, and when it\r\nis shut upon you reading them you may know yourself to be happier. But\r\nin pure prose narratives this exquisite poet, delightful playwright, and\r\nunquestionable though too much wasted genius, never seems quite at home.\r\nFor though they sometimes have a poignant appeal, it is almost always\r\nthe illegitimate or at any rate extrinsic one of revelation of the\r\nauthor's personal feeling; or else that of formulation of the general\r\neffects of passion, not that of embodiment of its working.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Frédéric et Bernerette._]\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, there are few more pathetic stories in substance, or\r\nin occasional expression of a half-aphoristic kind, than _Frédéric et\r\nBernerette_. The grisette heroine has shed all the vulgarity of Paul de\r\nKock's at his worst, and has in part acquired more poignancy than that\r\nof Murger at his best. Her final letter to her lover, just before her\r\nsecond and successful attempt at suicide, is almost consummate. But,\r\nsomehow or other, it strikes one rather as a marvellous single study--a\r\nsort of modernised and transcended _Spectator_ paper--a \"Farewell of a\r\nDeserted Damsel\"--than as part, or even as _dénouement_, of a story.\r\nWhen the author says, \"Je ne sais pas lequel est le plus cruel, de\r\nperdre tout à coup la femme qu'on aime par son inconstance, ou par sa\r\nmort,\" he says one of the final things finally. But it would be as final\r\nand as impressive if it were an isolated _pensée_. The whole story is\r\nnot well told; Frédéric, though not at all a bad fellow, and an only too\r\nnatural one, is a thing of shreds and patches, not gathered together and\r\ngrasped as they should be in the hand of the tale-teller; the narrative\r\n\"backs and fills\" instead of sweeping straight onwards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Les Deux Maîtresses, Le Fils du Titien_, etc.]\r\n\r\nSo, again, the first story,[235] _Les Deux Maîtresses_, with its\r\ninspiring challenge-overture, \"Croyez-vous, madame, qu'il soit possible\r\nd'être amoureux de deux personnes à la fois?\" is in parts interesting.\r\nBut one reader at least cannot help being haunted as he reads by the\r\nnotion how much better Mérimée would have told it. _Le Fils du\r\nTitien_--the story of the great master's lazy son, on whom even love and\r\nentire self-sacrifice--lifelong too--on the part of a great lady, cannot\r\nprevail to do more in his father's craft than one exquisite picture of\r\nherself, inscribed with a sonnet renouncing the pencil thenceforth--is\r\nthe best told story in the book. But Gautier would certainly have done\r\nit even better. _Margot_, in the same fatal way and, I fear, in the same\r\ndegree, suggests the country tales of Musset's own faithless love.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Emmeline._]\r\n\r\nBut the most crucial example of the \"something wrong\" which pursues\r\nMusset in pure prose narrative is _Emmeline_. It is quite free from\r\nthose unlucky, and possibly unfair, comparisons with contemporaries\r\nwhich have been affixed to its companions. A maniac of parallels might\r\nindeed call it something of a modernised _Princesse de Clèves_; but this\r\nwould be quite idle. The resemblance is simply in situation; that is to\r\nsay, in the _publica materies_ which every artist has a right to make\r\nhis own by private treatment. Emmeline Duval is a girl of great wealth\r\nand rather eccentric character, who chooses to marry (he has saved her\r\nlife, or at any rate saved her from possible death and certain damage) a\r\nperson of rank but no means, M. de Marsan. There is real love between\r\nthe two, and it continues on his side altogether unimpaired, on hers\r\nuntroubled, for years. A conventional lady-killer tries her virtue, but\r\nis sent about his business. But then there turns up one Gilbert, to whom\r\nshe yields--exactly how far is not clearly indicated. M. de Marsan finds\r\nit out and takes an unusual line. He will not make any scandal, and will\r\nnot even call the lover out. He will simply separate and leave her whole\r\nfortune to his wife. She throws her marriage contract into the fire (one\r\ndoes not presume to enquire how far this would be effective), dismisses\r\nGilbert through the medium of her sister, and--we don't know what\r\nhappened afterwards.\r\n\r\nNow the absence of _finale_ may bribe critics of the present day; for my\r\npart, as I have ventured to say more than once before, it seems that if\r\nyou accept this principle you had much better carry it through, have no\r\nmiddle or beginning, and even no title, but issue, in as many copies as\r\nyou please, a nice quire or ream of blank paper with your name on it.\r\nThe purchasers could cut the name out, and use it for original\r\ncomposition in a hundred forms, from washing bills to tragedies.\r\n\r\nBut I take what Musset has given me, and, having an intense admiration\r\nfor the author of _A Saint Blaise_ and _L'Andalouse_ and the _Chanson de\r\nFortunio_, a lively gratitude to the author of _Il ne faut jurer de\r\nrien_ and _Il faut qu'une porte soit ouverte ou fermée_, call _Emmeline_\r\na very badly told and uninteresting story. The almost over-elaborate\r\ndescription of the heroine at the beginning does not fit in with her\r\nsubsequent conduct; Gilbert is a nonentity; the husband, though noble in\r\nconduct, is pale in character, and the sister had much better have been\r\nleft out.[236] So the rest may be silence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gérard de Nerval--his peculiar position.]\r\n\r\nI have been accused (quite good-naturedly) of putting Rabelais in this\r\nhistory because I liked him, though he was not a novelist. My conscience\r\nis easy there; and I think I have refuted the peculiar charge\r\nbeforehand. But I might have a little more difficulty (though I should\r\nstill lose neither heart nor hope) in the case of the ill-fated but\r\nwell-beloved writer whom gods and men call Gérard de Nerval, or simply\r\nGérard, though librarians and bibliographers sometimes insist on his\r\nlegal surname, Labrunie. It certainly would be difficult, from the same\r\npoint of view of strict legality, to call anything of his exactly a\r\nnovel. He was a poet, a dramatist, a voyage-and-travel writer, a\r\nbibliographer (strange trade, which associates the driest with the most\r\n\"necta_w_eous\" of men!) even sometimes a tale-teller by name, but even\r\nthen hardly a novelist. Yet he managed to throw over the most unlikely\r\nmaterial a novelish or at least a romantic character, which is\r\nsometimes--nay, very often--utterly wanting in professed and admitted\r\nmasters of the business; and he combines with this faculty--or rather he\r\nexalts and transports it into--a strange and exquisite charm, which\r\nnobody else in French, except Nodier[237] (who very possibly taught\r\nGérard something), possesses, and which, though it is rather commoner in\r\nEnglish and in the best and now almost prehistoric German, is rare\r\nanywhere, and, in Gérard's peculiar brand of it, almost entirely\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nFor this \"Anodos\"--the most unquestionably entitled to that title of all\r\nmen in letters; this wayless wanderer on the earth and above the earth;\r\nthis inhabitant of mad-houses; this victim, finally, either of his own\r\ndespair and sorrow or of some devilry on the part of others,[238]\r\nunites, in the strange spell which he casts over all fit readers, what,\r\nbut for him, one might have called the idiosyncrasies in strangeness of\r\nauthors quite different from each other and--except at the special\r\npoints of contact--from him. He is like Borrow or De Quincey (though he\r\ngoes even beyond both) in the singular knack of endowing or investing\r\nknown places and commonplace actions with a weird second essence and\r\nsecond intention. He is like Charles Lamb in his power of dropping from\r\nquaintness and almost burlesque into the most touching sentiment and\r\nemotion. Mr. Lang, in his Introduction to Poe, has noticed how Gérard\r\nresembles America's one \"poet of the first order\" in fashioning lines\r\n\"on the further side of the border between verse and music\"--a remark\r\nwhich applies to his prose as well.[239] He has himself admitted a kind\r\nof _sorites_ of indebtedness to Diderot, Sterne, Swift, Rabelais,\r\nFolengo, Lucian, and Petronius. But this is merely on the comic and\r\npurely intellectual side of him, while it is further confined, or nearly\r\nso, to the trick of deliberate \"promiscuousness.\" On the\r\nemotional-romantic if not even tragic score he may write off all imputed\r\nindebtedness--save once more in some degree, to Nodier. And the\r\nconsequence is that those who delight in him derive their delight from\r\nsources of the most extraordinarily various character, probably never\r\nrepresented by an exactly similar group in the case of any two\r\nindividual lovers, but quite inexhaustible. To represent him to those\r\nwho do not know him is not easy; to represent him to those who do is\r\nsure, for this very reason, to arouse mild or not mild complaints of\r\ninadequacy. And it must be clear, from what has been already said, that\r\nsome critic may very likely exclaim, in reference to any selected piece,\r\n\"Why, this is neither a novel nor a romance, nor even in any\r\nlegitimate sense a tale!\" The inestimable rejoinder already\r\nquoted,[240]--episcopal, and dignifying even that order though it was\r\nmade only by a bishop _in partibus_--is the only one here.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Bohême Galante_, _Les Filles du Feu_, and _Le Rêve et la\r\nVie_.]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of discussing or illustrating, in short space and due\r\nproportion, the novel or _roman_ element in such a writer must be\r\nsufficiently obvious. His longer travels in Germany and the East are\r\nsteeped in this element; and the shorter compositions which bear names\r\nof novel-character are often \"little travels\" in his native province,\r\nthe Isle of France, and that larger _banlieue_ of Paris, towards Picardy\r\nand Flanders, which our Seventy Thousand saved, by dying, the other day.\r\nBut it is impossible--and might even, if possible, be superfluous--to\r\ntouch the first group. Of the second there are three subdivisions,\r\nwhich, however, are represented with not inconsiderable variation in\r\ndifferent issues.[241] Their titles are _La Bohême Galante_, _Les Filles\r\ndu Feu_, and _Le Rêve et la Vie_, the last of which contains only one\r\nsection, _Aurélia_, never, if I do not mistake, revised by Gérard\r\nhimself, and only published after his most tragic death. Its\r\n_supra_-title really describes the most characteristic part or feature\r\nof all the three and of Gérard's whole work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their general character.]\r\n\r\nTo one who always lived, as Paul de Saint-Victor put it in one of the\r\nbest of those curious exercises of his mastery over words, \"in the\r\nfringes[242] of the actual world,\" this confusion of place and no\r\nplace, this inextricable blending of fact and dream, imagination and\r\nreality, was natural enough; and no one but a Philistine will find fault\r\nwith the sometimes apparently mechanical and Sternian transitions which\r\nform part of its expression. There was, indeed, an inevitable\r\n_mixedness_ in that strange nature of his; and he will pass from almost\r\n\"true Dickens\" (he actually admits inspiration from him) in accounts of\r\nthe Paris _Halles_, or of country towns, to De Quinceyish passages, free\r\nfrom that slight touch of _apparatus_ which is undeniable now and then\r\nin the Opium Eater. Here are longish excursions of pure family history;\r\nthere, patches of criticism in art or drama; once at least an elaborate\r\nand--for the time--very well informed as well as enthusiastic sketch of\r\nFrench seventeenth-century poetry. It may annoy the captious to find\r\nanother kind of confusion, for which one is not sure that Gérard himself\r\nwas responsible, though it is consistent enough with his peculiarities.\r\nPassages are redistributed among different books and pieces in a rather\r\nbewildering manner; and you occasionally rub your eyes at coming\r\nacross--in a very different context, or simply shorn of its old\r\none--something that you have met before. To others this, if not exactly\r\nan added charm, will at any rate be admitted to \"grace of congruity.\" It\r\nwould be less like Gérard if it were otherwise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Particular examples.]\r\n\r\nIn fact it is in these mixed pieces that Gérard's great attraction lies.\r\nHis regular stories, professedly of a Hoffmannesque kind, such as _La\r\nMain Enchantée_ and _Le Monstre Vert_, are good, but not extraordinarily\r\ngood, and classable with many other things of many other people. I, at\r\nleast, know nothing quite like _Aurélia_ and _Sylvie_, though the\r\ndream-pieces of Landor and De Quincey have a certain likeness, and\r\nNodier's _La Fée aux Miettes_ a closer one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Aurélia._]\r\n\r\n_Aurélia_ (which, whether complete in itself or not, was pretty clearly\r\nintended to be followed by other things under the general title of _Le\r\nRêve et la Vie_) has, as might be expected, more dream than life in it.\r\nOr rather it is like one of those actual dreams which themselves mix up\r\nlife--a dream in the composition. Aurélia is the book-name of a lady,\r\nloved (actually, it seems) and in some degree responsible for her\r\nlover's aberrations of mind. He thinks he loves another, but finds he\r\ndoes not. The two objects of his passion meet, and the second generously\r\nbrings about a sort of reconciliation with the first. But he has to go\r\nto Paris on business, and there he becomes a mere John-a-Dreams, if not,\r\nin a mild way, a mere Tom of Bedlam. The chief drops into reality,\r\nindeed, are mentions of his actual visits to _maisons de santé_. But the\r\nthing is impossible to abstract or analyse, too long to translate as a\r\nwhole, and too much woven in one piece to cut up. It must be read as it\r\nstands, and any person of tolerable intelligence will know in a page or\r\ntwo whether Gérard is the man for him or not. But when he was writing it\r\nhe was already over even the fringe of ordinary sane life, and near the\r\nclose of life itself. In _Sylvie_ he had not drifted so far; and it is\r\nperhaps his best diploma-piece.[243]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And especially _Sylvie_.]\r\n\r\nFor _Sylvie_, with its sub-title, \"Souvenirs du Valois,\" surely exhibits\r\nGérard, outside the pure travel-books, at his very best, as far as\r\nconcerns that mixture of _rêve_ and _réalité_--the far-off goal of\r\nGautier's[244] _Chimère_--which has been spoken of. The author comes out\r\nof a theatre where he has only seen Her, having never, though a constant\r\nworshipper, troubled himself to ask, much less to seek out, what She\r\nmight be off the stage. And here we may give an actual piece of him.\r\n\r\n     We were living then in a strange kind of time,[245] one of\r\n     those which are wont to come after revolutions, or the\r\n     decadences of great reigns. There was no longer any\r\n     gallantry of the heroic kind, as in the time of the Fronde;\r\n     no vice, elegant and in full dress, as in that of the\r\n     Regency; no \"Directory\" scepticism and foolish orgies. It\r\n     was a mixture of activity, hesitation, and idleness--of\r\n     brilliant utopias; of religious or philosophical aspiration;\r\n     of vague enthusiasms mingled with certain instincts of a\r\n     sort of Renaissance. Men were weary of past discords; of\r\n     uncertain hopes, much as in the time of Petronius or\r\n     Peregrinus. The materialist part of us hungered for the\r\n     bouquet of roses which in the hands of Isis was to\r\n     regenerate it--the Goddess, eternally young and pure,\r\n     appeared to us at night and made us ashamed of the hours we\r\n     had lost in the day. We were not at the age of ambition, and\r\n     the greedy hunt for place and honours kept us out of\r\n     possible spheres of work. Only the poet's Ivory Tower\r\n     remained for us, and we climbed it ever higher and higher to\r\n     be clear of the mob. At the heights whither our masters\r\n     guided us we breathed at last the pure air of solitude; we\r\n     drank in the golden cup of legend; we were intoxicated with\r\n     poetry and with love. But, alas! it was only love of vague\r\n     forms; of tints roseal and azure; of metaphysical phantoms.\r\n     The real woman, seen close, revolted our ingenuousness: we\r\n     would have had her a queen or a goddess, and to draw near\r\n     her was fatal.\r\n\r\nBut he went from the play to his club, and there somebody asked him for\r\nwhat person (in such cases one regrets _laquelle_) he went so constantly\r\nto the same house; and, on the actress being named, kindly pointed out\r\nto him a third member of this club as the lady's lover-in-title. The\r\npeculiar etiquette of the institution demanded, it seems, that the\r\nfortunate gallant should escort the beloved home, but then go to the\r\n_cercle_ and play (they were wise enough to play whist then) for great\r\npart of the night before exercising the remainder of his rights and\r\nprivileges. In the interval, apparently, other cats might be grey. And,\r\nas it happened, Gérard saw in a paper that some shares of his, long\r\nrubbish, had become of value. He would be better off; he might aspire\r\nto a portion of the lady's spare hours. But this notion, it is not\r\nsurprising to hear, did not appeal to our Gérard. He sees in the same\r\npaper that a _fête_ is going to take place in his old country of the\r\nValois; and when at last he goes home two \"faces in the fire\" rise for\r\nhim, those of the little peasant girl Sylvie and of the châtelaine\r\nAdrienne--beautiful, triumphant, but destined to be a nun. Unable to\r\nsleep, he gets up at one in the morning, and manages to find himself at\r\nLoisy, the scene of the _fête_, in time.\r\n\r\nOne would fain go on, but duty forbids a larger allotment of space; and,\r\nafter all, the thing itself may be read by any one in half an hour or\r\nso, and will not, at least ought not, to be forgotten for half a\r\nlifetime--or a whole one. The finding of Sylvie, no longer a _little_\r\ngirl, but still a girl, still not married, though, as turns out, about\r\nto be so, is chequered with all sorts of things--sketches of landscape;\r\ntouches of literature; black-and-white renderings of the _Voyage à\r\nCythère_; verses to Adrienne; to the actress Aurélie (to become later\r\nthe dream-Aurélia); and, lastly--in the earlier forms of the piece at\r\nany rate--snatches of folk-song, including that really noble ballad:\r\n\r\n    Quand Jean Renaud de la guerre revint,\r\n\r\nwhich falls very little, if at all, short of the greatest specimens of\r\nEnglish, German, Danish, or Spanish.\r\n\r\nAnd over and through it all, and in other pieces as well, there is the\r\nfaint, quaint, music--prose, when not verse--which reminds one[246]\r\nsomehow of Browning's famous Toccata-piece. Only the \"dear dead women\"\r\nare dear dead fairies; and the whole might be sung at that \"Fairy's\r\nFuneral\" which Christopher North imagined so well, though he did not\r\ncarry it out quite impeccably.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alfred de Vigny: _Cinq-Mars_.]\r\n\r\nThe felicity of being enabled to know the causes of things, a recognised\r\nand respectable form of happiness, is also one which I have recently\r\nenjoyed in respect of Alfred de Vigny's _Cinq-Mars_. For Vigny as a poet\r\nmy admiration has always been profound. He appears to me to have\r\ncompleted, with Agrippa d'Aubigné, Corneille, and Victor Hugo, the\r\n_quatuor_ of French poets who have the secret of magnificence;[247] and,\r\nscanty as the amount of his poetical work is, _Éloa_, _Dolorida_, _Le\r\nCor_, and the finest passages in _Les Destinées_ have a definite variety\r\nof excellence and essence which it would not be easy to surpass in kind,\r\nthough it might be in number, with the very greatest masters of poetry.\r\nBut I have never been able, frankly and fully, to enjoy his novels,\r\nespecially _Cinq-Mars_. In my last reading of the chief of them I came\r\nupon an edition which contains what I had never seen before--the\r\nsomewhat triumphant and strongly defiant tract, _Réflexions sur la\r\nVérité dans l'Art_, which the author prefixed to his book after its\r\nsuccess. This tractate is indeed not quite consistent with itself, for\r\nit ends in confession that truth in art is truth in observation of human\r\nnature, not mere authenticity of fact, and that such authenticity is of\r\nmerely secondary importance at best. But in the opening he had taken\r\nlines--or at any rate had said things--which, if not absolutely\r\ninconsistent with, certainly do not lead to, this sound conclusion. In\r\nwriting historical novels (he tells us) he thought it better not to\r\nimitate the foreigners (it is clear that this is a polite way of\r\nindicating Scott), who in their pictures put the historical dominators\r\nof them in the background; he has himself made such persons principal\r\nactors. And though he admits that \"a treatise on the decline and fall of\r\nfeudalism in France; on the internal conditions and external relations\r\nof that country; on the question of military alliances with foreigners;\r\non justice as administered by parliaments, and by secret commissions on\r\ncharges of sorcery,\" might not have been read while the novel _was_;\r\nthe sentence suggests, with hardly a possibility of rebuttal, that a\r\ntreatise of this kind was pretty constantly in his own mind while he was\r\nwriting the novel itself. And the earlier sentence about putting the\r\nmore important historical characters in the foreground remains \"firm,\"\r\nwithout any necessity for argument or suggestion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The faults in its general scheme.]\r\n\r\nNow I have more than once in this very book, and often elsewhere,\r\ncontended, rightly or wrongly, that this \"practice of the foreigners,\"\r\nin _not_ making dominant historical characters their own dominant\r\npersonages, is _the_ secret of success in historical novel-writing, and\r\nthe very feather (and something more) in the cap of Scott himself which\r\nshows his chieftainship. And, again rightly or wrongly, I have also\r\ncontended that the hand of purpose deadens and mummifies story. Vigny's\r\nown remarks, despite subsequent--if not recantation--qualification of\r\nthem, show that the lie of his land, the tendency of his exertion, _was_\r\nin these two, as I think, wrong directions. And I own that this\r\nexplained to me what I had chiefly before noticed as merely a fact,\r\nwithout enquiring into it, that _Cinq-Mars_, admirably written as it is;\r\npossessing as it does, with a hero who might have been made interesting,\r\na great person like Richelieu to make due and not undue use of; plenty\r\nof thrilling incident at hand, and some actually brought in; love\r\ninterest _ad libitum_ and fighting hardly less so; a tragic finish from\r\nhistory, and opportunity for plenty of lighter contrast from Tallemant\r\nand the Memoirs--that, I say, _Cinq-Mars_, with all this and the\r\ngreatness of its author in other work, has always been to me not a live\r\nbook, and hardly one which I can even praise as statuesque.[248]\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt a misfortune for the book with its later readers--the\r\nearlier for nearly twenty years were free from this--that it comes into\r\nclosest comparison with Dumas' best work. Its action, indeed, takes\r\nplace in the very \"Vingt Ans\" during which we know (except from slight\r\nretrospect) nothing of what D'Artagnan and the Three were doing. But\r\nmore than one or two of the same historical characters figure, and in\r\nthe chapters dealing with the obscure _émeute_ which preceded the actual\r\nconspiracy, as well as in the scenes touching Anne of Austria's private\r\napartments, the parallel is very close indeed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And in its details.]\r\n\r\nNow of course Dumas could not write like Vigny; and though, as is\r\npointed out elsewhere, to regard him as a vulgar fellow is the grossest\r\nof blunders as well as a great injustice, Vigny, in thought and taste\r\nand _dianoia_ generally, was as far above him as in style.[249] But that\r\nis not the question. I have said[250] that I do not quite _know_\r\nD'Artagnan, though I think I know Athos, as a man; but as a novel-hero\r\nthe Gascon seems to me to \"fill all numbers.\" Cinq-Mars may be a\r\nsuccession or chain of type-personages--generous but headlong youth,\r\nspoilt favourite, conspirator and something like traitor, finally\r\nvictim; but these are the \"flat\" characters (if one may so speak) of the\r\ntreatise, not the \"round\" ones of the novel. And I cannot _unite_ them.\r\nHis love-affair with Marie de Gonzague leaves me cold. His friend, the\r\nyounger De Thou, is hardly more than \"an excellent person.\" The\r\npersecution of Urbain Grandier and the sufferings of the Ursuline Abbess\r\nseem to me--to use the old schoolboy word--to be hopelessly \"muffed\";\r\nand if any one will compare the accounts of the taking of the\r\n\"Spanish bastion\" at Perpignan with the exploit at that other\r\nbastion--Saint-Gervais at Rochelle--he will see what I mean as well as\r\nin any single instance. The second part, where we come to the actual\r\nconspiracy, is rather better than the first, if not much; and I think\r\nVigny's presentment of Richelieu has been too much censured. Armand\r\nDuplessis was a very great man; but unless you accept the older\r\nMachiavellian and the more modern German doctrines as to what a great\r\nman may do, he must also be pronounced a most unscrupulous one; while\r\nthere is little doubt (unless you go back to Louis XI.) that Vigny was\r\nright in regarding him as the original begetter of the French\r\nRevolution. But he is not here made by any means wholly inhuman, and\r\nVigny makes it justly clear that, if he had not killed Cinq-Mars,\r\nCinq-Mars would have killed him. In such cases of course the person who\r\nbegins may be regarded as the assassin; but it is doubtful whether this\r\nis distributive justice of the highest order. And I do not see much\r\nsalvation for France in Henry d'Effiat.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is a digression from our proper subject, but one\r\njustifying itself after a fashion, inasmuch as it results from Vigny's\r\nown faulty handling of the subject itself and is appropriate to his line\r\nof argument in his _Examen_. He has written the novel not as he ought\r\nand as he ought not. The political and historical interests overshadow,\r\nconfuse, and hamper the purely \"fictional\" (as people say now), and when\r\nhe has got hold of a scene which _is_ either purely \"fictional,\" or\r\nhistorical with fictitious possibilities, he does not seem (to me) to\r\nknow how to deal with it. There is one--of the extremest melodramatic\r\ncharacter and opportunities--where, in a hut perched on the side of a\r\nPyrenean gorge or cañon, Richelieu's villainous tool, the magistrate\r\nLaubardemont; his mad niece, the former Ursuline Abbess, who has helped\r\nto ruin Urbain Grandier; his outcast son Jacques, who has turned Spanish\r\nofficer and general bravo; and a smuggler who has also figured in the\r\nGrandier business, forgather; where the mad Abbess dies in terror, and\r\nJacques de Laubardemont by falling through the flimsy hut-boards into\r\nthe gorge, his father taking from him, by a false pretence before his\r\ndeath, the treaty between the Cinq-Mars conspirators and Spain. All this\r\nis sufficiently \"horrid,\" as the girls in _Northanger Abbey_ would say,\r\nand divers French contemporaries of Vigny's from Hugo to Soulié would\r\nhave made good horrors of it. In his hands it seems (to me) to miss\r\nfire. So, again, he has a well-conceived interview, in which Richelieu,\r\nfor almost the last time, shows \"the power of a strong mind over a weak\r\none,\" and brings the King to abject submission and the surrender of\r\nCinq-Mars, by the simple process of leaving his Majesty to settle by\r\nhimself the problems that drop in from France, England, and where or\r\nwhence not, during the time of the Cardinal's absence. It is less of a\r\nfailure than the other, being more in Vigny's own line; but it is\r\nimpossible not to remember several scenes--not one only--in _Quentin\r\nDurward_, and think how much better Scott would have done it; several in\r\nthe Musketeer-trilogy, if not also in the Margot-Chicot series, and make\r\na parallel reflection. And as a final parry by anticipation to the\r\nobjection that such comparison is \"rascally,\" let it be said that\r\nnothing of the kind ever created any prejudice against the book in my\r\ncase. I failed to get on with it long before I took the least trouble to\r\ndiscover critical reasons that might excuse that failure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Stello_ less of a novel, but containing better novel-stuff.]\r\n\r\nBut if any one be of taste sufficiently like mine to find disappointment\r\nof the unpleasant kind in _Cinq-Mars_, I think I can promise him an\r\nagreeable, if somewhat chequered, surprise when, remembering _Cinq-Mars_\r\nand basing his expectations upon it, he turns to _Stello_. It is true\r\nthat the book is, as a whole, even less \"precisely a novel\" than\r\nSainte-Beuve's _Volupté_. But for that very reason it escapes the\r\ndisplay of the disabilities which _Cinq-Mars_, being, or incurring\r\nobligation to be, precisely a novel, suffers. It is true also that it\r\nexhibits that fancy for putting historical persons in the first \"plan\"\r\nwhich he had avowed, and over which heads have been shaken. The bulk of\r\nit, indeed, consists of romanticised _histoires_ or historiettes (the\r\nnarrator calls them \"anecdotes\") of the sad and famous fates of two\r\nFrench poets, Gilbert and André Chénier, and of our English Chatterton.\r\nBut, then, no one of these can be called \"a dominant historical\r\npersonage,\" and the known facts permit themselves to be, and are,\r\n\"romanticised\" effectively enough. So the flower is in each case plucked\r\nfrom the nettle. And there is another flower of more positive and less\r\ncompensatory kind which blooms here, which is particularly welcome to\r\nsome readers, and which, from _Cinq-Mars_ alone, they could hardly have\r\nexpected to find in any garden of Alfred de Vigny's. For this springs\r\nfrom a root of ironic wit which almost approaches humour, which, though\r\nnever merry, is not seldom merciful, and is very seldom actually savage,\r\nthough often sad. Now irony is, to those who love it, the saving grace\r\nof everything that possesses it, almost equal in charm, and still more\r\nnearly equal in power, to the sheer beauty, which can dispense with it,\r\nbut which sometimes, and not so very rarely, is found in its company.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its framework and \"anecdotes.\"]\r\n\r\nThe substance, or rather the framework, of _Stello, ou Les Diables\r\nBleus_, requires very little amplification of its double title to\r\nexplain it. Putting that title in charade form, one might say that its\r\nfirst is a young poet who suffers from its second--like many other young\r\npersons, poetical and unpoetical, of times Romantic and un-Romantic.\r\nHaving an excessively bad fit of his complaint, he sends for a certain\r\n_docteur noir_ to treat the case. This \"Black Doctor\" is not a\r\ntrout-fly, nor the sort of person who might be expected in a story of\r\n_diablerie_. It is even suggested that he derived the name, by which he\r\nwas known to society, from the not specially individual habit of wearing\r\nblack clothes. But there must have been something not quite ordinarily\r\nhuman about him, inasmuch as, having been resident in London at the time\r\nof Chatterton's death in 1770, he was--apparently without any signs of\r\nOld Parr-like age--a fashionable doctor at Paris in the year 1832. His\r\nvisit ends, as usual, in a prescription, but a prescription of a very\r\nunusual kind. The bulk of it consists of the \"anecdotes\"--again perhaps\r\nnot a very uncommon feature of a doctor's visit, but told at such length\r\non the three subjects above mentioned that, with \"links\" and\r\nconclusion,[251] they run to nearly four hundred pages.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that some one may say \"_Connu!_\" both to the stories\r\nthemselves and to the moral of real suffering, as opposed to mere\r\nmegrim, which is so obviously deducible from them. But Stello was quite\r\nas clever as the objectors, and knew these things quite as\r\nwell--perhaps, as far as the case of Gilbert is concerned, rather better\r\nthan most Englishmen. It is in the manner of the Black Doctor's telling\r\nand handling that the charm lies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The death of Gilbert.]\r\n\r\nEven for those gluttons of matter who do not care much for manner there\r\nis a good deal in the three stories. The first avails itself--as Vigny\r\nhad unwisely _not_ availed himself in _Cinq-Mars_, though he was well\r\nacquainted with Shakespeare and lesser English masters--of the mixture\r\nof comic and tragic. The suffering[252] of the unfortunate youth who was\r\npartly a French Chatterton and partly a French Clare, his strange visit\r\nto the benevolent but rather ineffectual Archbishop of Paris, and the\r\nscene at his death-bed, exhibit, at nearly its best, the tragic power\r\nwhich Vigny possessed in a very high, though not always well exercised,\r\ndegree. And the passage of the poet's death is of such _macabre_ power\r\nthat one must risk a translation:\r\n\r\n     (_The doctor has been summoned, has found the patient in his\r\n     garret, bare of all furniture save a bed with tattered\r\n     clothes and an old trunk._)\r\n\r\n     His face was very noble and very beautiful; he looked at me\r\n     with fixed eyes, and between them and the nose, above the\r\n     cheeks, he showed that nervous contraction which no ordinary\r\n     convulsion can imitate, which no illness gives, but which\r\n     says to the physician, \"Go your ways!\" and is, as it were, a\r\n     standard which Death plants on his conquests. He clutched in\r\n     one hand his pen, his poor last pen, inky and ragged, in the\r\n     other a crust of his last piece of bread. His legs knocked\r\n     together, so as to make the crazy bed crackle. I listened\r\n     carefully to his hard breathing; I heard the rattle with\r\n     its hollow husk; and I recognised Death in the room as a\r\n     practised sailor recognises the tempest in the whistle of\r\n     the wind that precedes it.\r\n\r\n     \"Always the same, to all thou comest,\" I said to Death, he\r\n     himself speaking low enough for my lips to make, in dying\r\n     ears, only an indistinct murmur. \"I know thee always by\r\n     thine own hollow voice, lent to youth and age alike. How\r\n     well I know thee and thy terrors, which are no longer such\r\n     to me![253] I feel the dust that thy wings scatter in the\r\n     air as thou comest; I breathe the sickly odour of it; I see\r\n     its pale ashes fly, invisible as they may be to other men's\r\n     sight. O! thou Inevitable One, thou art here, verily thou\r\n     comest to save this man from his misery. Take him in thine\r\n     arms like a child; carry him off; save him; I give him to\r\n     thee. Save him only from the devouring sorrow that\r\n     accompanies us ever on the earth till we come to rest in\r\n     thee, O Benefactor and Friend!\"\r\n\r\n     I had not deceived myself, for Death it was. The sick man\r\n     ceased to suffer, and began suddenly to enjoy the divine\r\n     moment of repose which precedes the eternal immobility of\r\n     the body. His eyes grew larger, and were charged with\r\n     amazement; his mouth relaxed and smiled; his tongue twice\r\n     passed over his lips as if to taste once more, from some\r\n     unseen cup, a last drop of the balm of Life. And then he\r\n     said with that hoarse voice of the dying which comes from\r\n     the inwards and seems to come from the very feet:\r\n\r\n    At the banquet of life a guest ill-fated.[254]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The satiric episode--contrast.]\r\n\r\nBut this death-bed, and the less final but hardly less tragic wanderings\r\nof the victim in his visit to the Archbishop (by whom also the doctor\r\nhas been summoned), are contrasted and entangled, very skilfully indeed,\r\nwith a scene--the most different possible--in which he still appears.\r\nThe main personages in this, however, are his Majesty Louis XV. and the\r\nreigning favourite, Mademoiselle de Coulanges, a young lady who, from\r\nthe account given of her, might justify the description, assigned\r\nearlier to one of her official predecessors in a former reign, of being\r\n\"belle comme un ange, et bête comme un panier.\"[255] At first the lovers\r\n(if we are to call them so) are lying, most beautifully dressed and\r\nquite decorously, on different sofas, both of them with books in their\r\nhands, but one asleep and the other yawning. Suddenly the lady springs\r\nup shrieking, and the polite and amiable monarch (apart from his\r\nSolomonic or Sultanic weaknesses, and the perhaps graver indifference\r\nwith which he knowingly allowed France to go to the devil, Louis le\r\nBien-Aimé was really _le meilleur fils du monde_) does his best to\r\nconsole his beloved and find out the reason of her woes. It appears at\r\nlast that she thinks she has been bitten by a flea, and as the summer is\r\nvery hot, and there has been much talk of mad dogs, she is convinced\r\nthat the flea was a mad flea, and that she shall die of hydrophobia. (As\r\nit happens, the flea is not a flea at all, but a grain of snuff.)\r\nHowever, the Black Doctor is sent for, and finds the King as affable as\r\nusual, but Mlle. de Coulanges coiled up on a sofa--like something\r\nbetween a cat and a naughty child afraid of being scolded--and hiding\r\nher face. On being coaxed with the proper medical manner, she at last\r\nbursts out laughing, and finally they all laugh together, till his\r\nMajesty spills his coffee on his gold waistcoat, and then pulls the\r\ndoctor down on a sofa to talk Paris gossip. And now the Black One clears\r\nhimself from any connection with the serpent as far as wisdom is\r\nconcerned, though he has plenty of a better kind. Fresh from Gilbert's\r\nappeal to the Archbishop, he tries to interest this so amiable Royalty\r\nin the subject. But the result is altogether unfortunate. The lady is\r\nmerely contemptuous and bored. The King gets angry, and displays that\r\nindifference to anybody else's suffering which moralists (whether to an\r\nexaggerated extent or not, is another question) are wont to connect with\r\nexcessive attention to a man's own sensual enjoyments. After some by no\r\nmeans stupid but decidedly acid remarks on Voltaire, Rousseau, and\r\nothers, he takes (quite good-naturedly in appearance) the doctor's arm,\r\nwalks with him to the end of the long apartment, opens the door, quotes\r\ncertain satiric verses on literary and scientific \"gents,\" and--shuts it\r\non his medical adviser and guest.\r\n\r\nI know few things of the kind more neatly done, or better adjusted to\r\nheighten the tragic purpose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chatteron part.]\r\n\r\nTo an Englishman the next episode may be less satisfactory, though it\r\nwas very popular in France under its original form, and still more so\r\nwhen Vigny dramatised it in his famous _Chatterton_. It is not that\r\nthere is any (or at any rate much) of the usual caricature which was\r\n(let us be absolutely equitable and say) exchanged between the two\r\ncountries for so long a time. Vigny married an English wife, knew\r\nsomething of England, and a good deal of English literature. But,\r\nregardless of his own historical _penchants_ and of the moral of this\r\nvery book--that Sentiment must be kept under the control of Reason--he\r\nwas pleased to transmogrify Chatterton's compassionate Holborn landlady\r\ninto a certain Kitty Bell--a pastry-shop keeper close to the Houses of\r\nParliament, who is very beautiful except that she has the inevitable\r\n\"large feet\" (let us hope that M. le Comte de Vigny, who was a\r\ngentleman, took only the first _signalement_ from Madame la Comtesse),\r\nextraordinarily sentimental, and desperately though (let us hope again,\r\nfor she has a husband and two children) quite virtuously in love with\r\nthe boy from Bristol. He entirely transforms Lord Mayor Beckford's part\r\nin the matter;[256] changes, for his own purposes, the arsenic into\r\nopium (a point of more importance than it may seem), and in one blunt\r\nword does all he can to spoil the story. It is too common an experience\r\nwhen foreigners treat such things, and I say this with the fullest\r\nawareness of the danger of _De te fabula_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The tragedy of André Chénier.]\r\n\r\nThese two stories, however, fill scarcely more than a third of the book,\r\nand the other two-thirds, subtracting the moral at the end, deal with a\r\nmatter which Vigny, once more, understood thoroughly. The fate of André\r\nChénier is \"fictionised\" in nearly the best manner, though with the\r\nauthor's usual fault of inability to \"round out\" character. We do not\r\nsufficiently realise the poet himself. But his brother, Marie-Joseph,\r\nrequiring slighter presentment, has it; and so, on a still smaller\r\nscale, has the well-meaning but fatuous father, who, hopelessly\r\nmisunderstanding the signs of the times, actually precipitates his elder\r\nson's fate by applying, in spite of remonstrance, to the tiger-pole-cat\r\nRobespierre for mercy. The scene where this happens--and where the\r\n\"sea-green incorruptible\" himself, Saint-Just (prototype of so many\r\nRepublican enthusiasts, ever since and to-day), Marie-Joseph, and the\r\nBlack Doctor figure--is singularly good. Hardly less so are the\r\npictures--often painted by others but seldom better--of the ghastly\r\nthough in a way heroic merriment of the lost souls in Saint-Lazare,\r\nbetween their doom and its execution, and the finale. In this the\r\ndoctor's soldier-servant Blaireau (\"Badger\"), still a gunner on active\r\nservice (partly, one fancies, from former touches,[257] by concealed\r\ngood intention, partly from mere whim and from disgust at the drunken\r\nhectorings of General Henriot), refuses to turn his guns on the\r\nThermidorists, and thus saves France from at least the lowest depths of\r\nthe Revolutionary Inferno.[258] Perhaps there is here, as with Vigny's\r\nfiction throughout, a certain amateurishness, and a very distinct\r\ninability to keep apart things that had better not be mixed. But there\r\nis also evidence of power throughout, and there is actually some\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Servitude et Grandeur Militaires._]\r\n\r\nHis third and last work, of anything like the kind, _Servitude et\r\nGrandeur Militaires_, is no more of a regular novel than _Stello_; but,\r\nthough perhaps in an inferior degree, it shares the superiority of\r\n_Stello_ itself over _Cinq-Mars_ in power of telling a story. Like\r\n_Stello_, too, it is a frame of short tales, not a continuous narrative;\r\nand like that, and even to a greater degree, it exhibits the intense\r\nmelancholy (almost unique in its particular shade, though I suppose it\r\ncomes nearer to Leopardi's than to that of any other great man of\r\nletters) which characterises Alfred de Vigny. His own experience of\r\nsoldiering had not been fortunate. He had begun, as a mere boy, by\r\naccompanying Louis XVIII. in his flight before the Hundred Days; he had\r\nseen, for another fourteen or fifteen years during the Restoration,\r\n\r\n    No wars where triumphs on the victors wait,\r\n\r\nbut only the dreary garrison life (see on Beyle, _sup._ p. 149) of\r\nFrench peace time, and, in the way of active service, only what all\r\nsoldiers hate, the thankless and inglorious police-work which comes on\r\nthem through civil disturbance. Whether he was exactly the kind of man\r\nto have enjoyed the livelier side of martialism may be the subject of\r\nconsiderable doubt. But at any rate he had no chance of it, and his\r\nframework here is little more than a tissue of transcendental\r\n\"grousing.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first story.]\r\n\r\nThe first story illustrating \"Servitude\" is sufficiently horrible, and\r\nhas a certain element of paradox in it. The author, actually on his very\r\ndisagreeable introduction to a military career by flight, meets with an\r\nold officer who tells him his history. He has been at one time a\r\nmerchant sailor; and then in the service of the Directory, by whom he\r\nwas commissioned to carry convicts to Cayenne. The most noteworthy of\r\nthese, a young man of letters, who had libelled one of the tyrants, and\r\nhis still younger wife, are very charming people; and the captain, who\r\nmakes them his guests, becomes so fond of them that he even proposes to\r\ngive up his profession and farm with them in the colony. He has,\r\nhowever, sealed orders, to be opened only in mid-Atlantic; and when he\r\ndoes open them, he finds, to his unspeakable horror, a simple command to\r\nshoot the poet at once. He obeys; and the \"frightfulness\" is doubled by\r\nthe fact that a rather clumsy device of his to spare the wife the sight\r\nof the husband's death is defeated by the still greater clumsiness of a\r\nsubordinate. She goes mad; and, as expiation, he takes charge of her,\r\nshifts from navy to army, and carries her with him on all his campaigns,\r\nbeing actually engaged in escorting her on a little mule-cart when Vigny\r\nmeets him. They part; and ten years afterwards Vigny hears that the\r\nofficer was killed at Waterloo--his victim-charge following him a few\r\ndays later. The story is well told, and not, as actual things go,\r\nimpossible. But there are some questions which it suggests. \"Is it, _as\r\nliterature_, a whole?\" \"Is it worth telling?\" and \"Why on earth did the\r\ncaptain obey such an order from a self-constituted authority of\r\nscoundrels to whom no 'sacrament' could ever be binding, if it could\r\neven exist?\"[259]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The second]\r\n\r\nThe second is also tragical, but less so; and is again very well told.\r\nIt is concerned with the explosion of a powder-magazine--fortunately not\r\nthe main one--at Vincennes, brought about by the over-zeal of a good old\r\nadjutant, the happiness of whose domestic interior just before his fate\r\n(with some other things) forms one of Vigny's favourite contrasts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and third.]\r\n\r\nBut, as in _Stello_, he has kept the best wine to the last. The single\r\nillustration of _Grandeur_ must have, for some people, though it may not\r\nhave for all, the very rare interest of a story which would rather gain\r\nthan lose if it were true. It opens in the thick of the July\r\nRevolution, when the veteran French army--half-hearted and gaining no\r\nnew heart from the half-dead hands which ought to have guided it--was\r\nsubjected, on a larger scale, to the same sort of treatment which the\r\nfresh-recruited Sherwood Foresters (fortunately _not_ half-hearted)\r\nexperienced in Dublin at Easter 1916. The author, having, luckily for\r\nhimself, resigned his commission a year or two before, meets an old\r\nfriend--a certain Captain Renaud--who, though a _vieux de la vieille_,\r\nhas reached no higher position, but is adored by his men, and generally\r\nknown as \"Canne de Jonc,\" because he always carries that not very lethal\r\nweapon, and has been known to take it into action instead of a sword.\r\n\r\nIn the \"sullen interval\" of the crisis the two talk; and Renaud is led\r\ninto telling the chief experiences of his life. He had known little of\r\nhis father--a soldier before him--but had been taken by that father on\r\nBonaparte's Egyptian expedition till, at Malta, he was stopped by\r\nBonaparte himself, who would have no boy on it save Casabianca's (pity\r\nhe did not stop him too!). But he only sends Renaud back to the Military\r\nAcademy, and afterwards makes him his page. The father is blown up in\r\nthe _Orient_, but saved, and, though made prisoner by us, is well\r\ntreated, and, as being of great age and broken health, allowed, by\r\nCollingwood's interest, to go to Sicily. He dies on the way; but is able\r\nto send a letter to his son, which is one of the finest examples of\r\nVigny's peculiar melancholy irony. In this he recants his worship of the\r\n(now) Emperor. It has, however, no immediate effect on the son. But\r\nbefore long, by an accident, he is an unwilling and at first unperceived\r\nwitness of the famous historical or half-historical interview at\r\nFontainebleau between Napoleon and the Pope, where the bullied Holy\r\nFather enrages, but vanquishes, the conqueror by successively\r\nejaculating the two words _Commediante!_ and _Tragediante!_ (This scene\r\nis again admirable.) The page's absence from his ordinary duty excites\r\nsuspicion, and the Emperor, _more_ _suo_, exiles him to the\r\nfarce-tragedy of the Boulogne flotilla, where the clumsy flat-bottoms\r\nare sunk at pleasure as they exercise[260] by English frigates. The\r\nfather's experience is repeated with the son, for he also is captured\r\nand also falls into the beneficent power of Collingwood, whom Vigny\r\nalmost literally beatifies.[261] The Admiral keeps the young man on\r\nparole with him four years at sea, and when he has--\"so as by water\" if\r\nnot fire--overcome the temptation of breaking his word, effects exchange\r\nfor him. But, as is well known (the very words occur here, though I do\r\nnot know whether for the first time or not), Napoleon's motto in such\r\ncases was: \"Je n'aime pas les prisonniers. On se fait tuer.\" He goes\r\nback to his duty, but avoids recognition as much as possible, and\r\nreceives no, or hardly any, promotion. Once, just after Montmirail, he\r\nand the Emperor meet, whether with full knowledge on the latter's part\r\nis skilfully veiled. But they touch hands. Still Captain Renaud's\r\n_guignon_ pursues him in strange fashion; and during a night attack on a\r\nRussian post near Reims he kills, in a mere blind mellay, a boy officer\r\nof barely fourteen, and is haunted by remorse ever afterwards.\r\n\r\nA few days after telling the story he is shot by a _gamin_ whom older\r\nmen have made half-drunk and furnished with a pistol with directions to\r\ndo what he does. And all this is preserved from being merely sentimental\r\n(\"Riccobonish,\" as I think Vigny himself--but it may be somebody\r\nelse--has it) by the touch of true melancholy on the one hand and of\r\nall-saving irony on the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The moral of the three.]\r\n\r\nSo also these two curious books save Vigny himself to some extent from\r\nthe condemnation, or at any rate the exceedingly faint praise, which his\r\nprincipal novel may bring upon him as a novelist. But they do so to some\r\nextent only. It is clear even from them, though not so clear as it is\r\nfrom their more famous companion, that he was not to the manner born.\r\nThe riddles of the painful earth were far too much with him to permit\r\nhim to be an unembarrassed master or creator of pastime--not necessarily\r\nhorse-collar pastime by any means, but pastime pure and simple. His\r\npreoccupations with philosophy, politics, world-sorrow, and other things\r\nwere constantly cropping up and getting in the way of his narrative\r\nfaculty. I do not know that, even of the scenes that I have praised, any\r\none except the expurgated Crébillonade of the King and the Lady and the\r\nDoctor goes off with complete \"currency,\" and this is an episode rather\r\nthan a whole tale, though it gives itself the half-title of _Histoire\r\nd'une Puce Enragée_. He could never, I think, have done anything but\r\nshort stories; and even as a short-story teller he ranks with the other\r\nAlfred, Musset, rather than with Mérimée or Gautier. But, like Musset,\r\nhe presents us, as neither of the other two did (for Mérimée was not a\r\npoet, and Gautier was hardly a dramatist), with a writer, of mark all\r\nbut the greatest, in verse and prose and drama; while in prose and verse\r\nat least he shows that quality of melancholy magnificence which has been\r\nnoted, as hardly any one else does in all three forms, except Hugo\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE ON FROMENTIN'S _DOMINIQUE_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Note on Fromentin's _Dominique_: its altogether exceptional\r\ncharacter.]\r\n\r\nI have found it rather difficult to determine the place most proper for\r\nnoticing the _Dominique_ of Eugène Fromentin--one of the most remarkable\r\n\"single-speech\" novels in any literature. It was not published till the\r\nSecond Empire was more than half-way through, but it seems to have been\r\nwritten considerably earlier; and as it is equally remarkable for\r\n_lexis_ and for _dianoia_, it may, on the double ground, be best\r\nattached to this chapter, though Fromentin was younger than any one else\r\nhere dealt with, and belonged, in fact, to the generation of our later,\r\nthough not latest, constituents. But, in fact, it is a book like no\r\nother, and it is for this reason, and by no means as confessing omission\r\nor after-thought, that I have made the notice of it a note. In an\r\noutside way, indeed, it may be said to belong to the school of _René_,\r\nbut the resemblance is very partial.\r\n\r\nThe author was a painter--perhaps the only painter-novelist of merit,\r\nthough there are bright examples of painter-poets. His other literary\r\nwork consists of a good book on his Netherlandish brethren in art, and\r\nof two still better ones, descriptive of Algeria. And _Dominique_ itself\r\nhas unsurpassed passages of description at length, as well as numerous\r\ntiny touches like actual _remarques_ on the margin of the page. Only\r\nonce does his painter's eye seem to have failed him as to situation. The\r\nhero, when he has thrown himself on his knees before his beloved, and\r\nshe (who is married and \"honest\") has started back in terror, \"drags\r\nhimself after her.\" Now I believe it to be impossible for any one to\r\nexecute this manoeuvre without producing a ludicrous effect. For which\r\nreason the wise have laid it down that the kneeling posture should never\r\nbe resorted to unless the object of worship is likely to remain fairly\r\nstill. But this is, I think, the only slip in the book. It is\r\nexceedingly interesting to compare Fromentin's descriptions with those\r\nof Gautier on the one hand before him, and with those of Fabre and\r\nTheuriet on the other later. I should like to point out the differences,\r\nbut it is probably better merely to suggest the comparison. His actual\r\nwork in design and colour I never saw, but I think (from attacks on it\r\nthat I _have_ seen) I should like it.\r\n\r\nBut his descriptions, though they would always have given the book\r\ndistinction, would not--or would not by themselves--have given it its\r\nspecial appeal. Neither does that appeal lie in such story as there\r\nis--which, in fact, is very little. A French squire (he is more nearly\r\nthat than most French landlords have cared to be, or indeed have been\r\nable to be, since the Revolution and the Code Napoléon) is orphaned\r\nearly, brought up at his remote country house by an aunt, privately\r\ntutored for a time, not by an abbé, but by a young schoolmaster and\r\nliterary aspirant; then sent for three or four years to the nearest\r\n\"collége,\" where he is bored but triumphant: and at last, about his\r\n_vingt ans_, let loose in Paris. But--except once, and with the result,\r\nusual for him, of finding the thing a failure--he does not make the\r\nstock use of liberty at that age and in that place. He has, at school,\r\nmade friends with another youth of good family in the same province, who\r\nhas an uncle and cousins living in the town where the college is. The\r\neldest she-cousin of Olivier d'Orsel, Madeleine, is a year older than\r\nDominique de Bray, and of course he falls in love with her. But though\r\nshe, in a way, knows his passion, and, as one finds out afterwards,\r\nshares or might have been made to share it, the love is \"never told,\"\r\nand she marries another. The destined victims of the _un_smooth course,\r\nhowever, meet in Paris, where Dominique and Olivier, though they do not\r\nshare chambers, live in the same house and flat; and the story of just\r\novercome temptation is broken off at last in a passionate scene like\r\nthat of \"Love and Duty\"--which noble and strangely undervalued poem\r\nmight serve as a long motto or verse-prelude to the book. It is rather\r\nquestionable whether it would not be better without the thin frame of\r\nactual proem and conclusion, which does actually enclose the body of the\r\nnovel as a sort of _récit_, provoked partly by the suicide, or attempted\r\nsuicide, of Olivier after a life of fastidiousness and frivolity. The\r\nproem gives us Dominique as--after his passion-years, and his as yet\r\nunmentioned failure to achieve more than mediocrity in letters--a quiet\r\nif not cheerful married man with a charming wife, pretty children, a\r\ngood estate, and some peasants not in the least like those of _La\r\nTerre_; while in the epilogue the tutor Augustin, who has made his way\r\nat last and has also married happily, drives up to the door, and the\r\nbook ends abruptly. It is perhaps naughty, but one does not want the\r\nwife, or the children, or the good peasants, or the tutor Augustin,\r\nwhile the suicide of Olivier appears rather copy-booky. It is especially\r\nannoying thus to have what one does not want to know, and not what one,\r\nhowever childishly, does want to know--that is to say, the after-history\r\nof Madeleine.\r\n\r\nYet even in the preliminary forty or fifty pages few readers can fail to\r\nperceive that they have got hold of a most uncommon book. Its\r\nuncommonness, as was partly said above, does not consist merely in the\r\nexcellence of its description; nor in the acuteness of the occasional\r\n_mots_; nor in the passion of the two main characters; nor in the\r\nrepresentation of the mood of that \"discouraged generation of 1850\" of\r\nwhich it is, in prose and French, the other Testament corresponding to\r\nMatthew Arnold's in verse and English. Nor does it even consist in all\r\nthese added together; but in the way in which they are fused; in which\r\nthey permeate each other and make, not a group, but a whole. It might\r\neven, like Sainte-Beuve's _Volupté_ (_v. inf._). be called \"not\r\nprecisely a novel\" at all, and even more than Fabre's _Abbé Tigrane_\r\n(_v. inf._ again), rather a study than a story. And it is partly from\r\nthis point of view that one regrets the prologue and epilogue. No\r\ndoubt--and the plea is a recurring one--in life these storms and\r\nstresses, these failures and disappointments, do often subside into\r\nsomething parallel to Dominique's second existence as squire, sportsman,\r\nhusband, father, and farmer. No doubt they\r\n\r\n    Pulveris exigui jactu compacta quiescunt,\r\n\r\nwhether the dust is of the actual grave and its ashes, or the more\r\nsymbolical one of the end of love. But on the whole, for art's sake,\r\nthis somewhat prosaic _Versöhnung_ is better left behind the scenes. Yet\r\nthis may be a private--it may be an erroneous--criticism. The positive\r\npart of what has been said in favour of _Dominique_ is, I think,\r\nsomething more. There are few novels like it; none exactly like, and\r\nperhaps one does not want many or any more. But by itself it stands--and\r\nstands crowned.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[198] Some years after its original appearance Mr. Andrew Lang, in\r\ncollaboration with another friend of mine, who adopted the _nom de\r\nguerre_ of \"Paul Sylvester,\" published a complete translation under the\r\ntitle of _The Dead Leman_; and I believe that the late Mr. Lafacido\r\nHearn more recently executed another. But this last I have never seen.\r\n(The new pages which follow to 222, it may not be superfluous to repeat,\r\nappeared originally in the _Fortnightly Review_ for 1878, and were\r\nreprinted in _Essays on French Novelists_, London, 1891. The Essay\r\nitself contains, of course, a wider criticism of Gautier's work than\r\nwould be proper here.)\r\n\r\n[199] For, as a rule, the critical faculty is like wine--it steadily\r\nimproves with age. But of course anybody is at liberty to say, \"Only, in\r\nboth cases, when it is good to begin with.\"\r\n\r\n[200] I suppose this was what attracted Mr. Hearn; but, as I have said,\r\nI do not know his book itself.\r\n\r\n[201] I do not know how many of the users of the catchword \"purely\r\ndecorative,\" as applied to Moore, knew what they meant by it; but if\r\nthey meant what I have just said, I have no quarrel with them.\r\n\r\n[202] Yet even inside poetry not so very much before 1830.\r\n\r\n[203] Of course I know what a dangerous word this is; how often people\r\nwho have not a glimmering of it themselves deny it to others; and how it\r\nis sometimes seen in mere horseplay, often confounded with \"wit\" itself,\r\nand generally \"taken in vain.\" But one must sometimes be content with\r\n[Greek: phônêenta] or [Greek: phônanta] (the choice is open, but I\r\nprefer the latter) [Greek: synetoisi], and take the consequences of them\r\nwith the [Greek: asynetoi].\r\n\r\n[204] Some would allow it to Plautus, but I doubt; and even Martial did\r\nnot draw as much of it from Spanish soil as must have been latent\r\nthere--unless the Goths absolutely imported it. Perhaps the nearest\r\napproach in him is the sudden turn when the obliging Phyllis, just as he\r\nis meditating with what choice and costly gifts he shall reward her\r\nvaried kindnesses, anticipates him by modestly asking, with the sweetest\r\npreliminary blandishments, for a jar of wine (xii. 65).\r\n\r\n[205] La Fontaine may be desiderated. His is certainly one of the most\r\n_humouresque_ of wits; but whether he has pure humour I am not sure.\r\n\r\n[206] This is an exception to the rule of _tout passe_, if not of _tout\r\ncasse_. You can still buy avanturine wax; only, like all waxes, except\r\nred and black, it seals very badly, and makes \"kisses\" in a most untidy\r\nfashion. Avanturine should be left to the original stone--to peat-water\r\nrunning over pebbles with the sun on it--and to eyes.\r\n\r\n[207] I once knew an incident which might have figured in these scenes,\r\nand which would, I think, have pleased Théo. But it happened just after\r\nhis own death, in the dawn of the aesthetic movement. A man, whom we may\r\ncall A, visited a friend, say B, who was doing his utmost to be in the\r\nmode. A had for some time been away from the centre; and B showed him,\r\nin hopes to impress, the blue china the Japanese mats and fans, the\r\nrush-bottomed chairs, the Morris paper and curtains, the peacock\r\nfeathers, etc. But A looked coldly on them and said, \"Where is your\r\nbrass tray?\" And B was saddened and could only plead, \"It is coming\r\ndirectly; but you know too much.\"\r\n\r\n[208] They are both connected with the \"orgie\"-mania, and the last is a\r\ndeliberate burlesque of the originals of P. L. Jacob, Janin, Eugène Sue,\r\nand Balzac himself.\r\n\r\n[209] It is here that the famous return of a kiss _revu, corrigé et\r\nconsidérablement augmenté_ is recorded.\r\n\r\n[210] He (it is some excuse for him that this suggested a better thing\r\nin certain _New Arabian Nights_) buys, furnishes, and subsequently\r\ndeserts an empty house to give a ball in, and put his friends on no\r\nscent of his own abode; but he makes this \"own abode\" a sort of Crystal\r\nPalace in the centre of a whole ring-fence of streets, with the old\r\nfronts of the houses kept to avert suspicion of the Seraglio of Eastern\r\nbeauties, the menagerie and beast fights, and the slaves whom (it is\r\nrather suggested than definitely stated) he occasionally murders. He\r\nperforms circus-rider feats when he meets a lady (or at least a woman)\r\nin the Bois de Boulogne; he sets her house on fire when it occurs to him\r\nthat she has received other lovers there; and we are given to understand\r\nthat he blows up his own palace when he returns to the East. In fact, he\r\nis a pure anticipated cognition of a Ouidesque super-hero as parodied by\r\nSir Francis Burnand (and independently by divers schoolboys and\r\nundergraduates) some fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n[211] I have seen an admirable criticism of this \"thing\" in one word,\r\n\"Cold!\"\r\n\r\n[212] On the cayenne-and-claret principle which Haydon (one hopes\r\nlibellously, in point of degree) attributed to Keats. (It was probably a\r\ndevilled-biscuit, and so quite allowable.)\r\n\r\n[213] \"Théo\" has no repute as a psychologist; but I have known such\r\nrepute attained by far less subtle touches than this.\r\n\r\n[214] For more on them, with a pretty full abstract of _Le Capitaine\r\nFracasse_, see the Essay more than once mentioned.\r\n\r\n[215] _V. sup._ Vol. I. p. 279-286. Of course the duplication, _as\r\nliterature_, is positively interesting and welcome.\r\n\r\n[216] I--some fifty years since--knew a man who, with even greater\r\njuvenility, put pretty much the same doctrine in a Fellowship Essay. He\r\ndid not obtain that Fellowship.\r\n\r\n[217] It might possibly have been shortened with advantage in\r\nconcentration of effect. But the story (pleasantly invented, if not\r\ntrue) of Gautier's mother locking him up in his room that he might not\r\nneglect his work (of the nature of which she was blissfully ignorant)\r\nnearly excuses him. A prisoner will naturally be copious rather than\r\nterse.\r\n\r\n[218] It may amuse some readers to know that I saw the rather famous\r\nlithograph (of a lady and gentleman kissing each other at full speed on\r\nhorseback), which owes its subject to the book, in no more romantic a\r\nplace that a very small public-house in \"Scarlet town,\" to which I had\r\ngone, not to quench my thirst or for any other licentious purpose, but\r\nto make an appointment with--a chimney-sweep.\r\n\r\n[219] Some might even say he had too much.\r\n\r\n[220] For reference to previous dealings of mine with Mérimée see\r\n_Preface_.\r\n\r\n[221] It is sad, but necessary, to include M. Brunetière among the\r\nlatter class.\r\n\r\n[222] He was never a professor, but was an inspector; and, though I may\r\nbe biassed, I think the inspector is usually the more \"donnish\" animal\r\nof the two.\r\n\r\n[223] And perhaps in actual life, if not in literature, I should prefer\r\na young woman who might possibly have me murdered if she discovered a\r\nblood-feud between my ancestors and hers, to one in whose company it\r\nwould certainly be necessary to keep a very sharp look-out on my watch.\r\nThe two risks are not equally \"the game.\"\r\n\r\n[224] Many a reader, I hope, has been reminded, by one or the other, or\r\nboth, of the _Anatomy of Melancholy_, which also contains the story: and\r\nhas gone to it with the usual consequence of reading nothing else for\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\n[225] \"Mérimée était gentilhomme: Sainte-Beuve ne l'était pas.\" I forget\r\nwho said this, but it was certainly said, and I think it was true.\r\n\r\n[226] This is not merely a waste of explosives. I have actually seen the\r\nstory dismissed as a \"merely faithful record of the facts\" or something\r\nof the sort. One was at least obliged to the man for reminding one of\r\nPartridge on Garrick.\r\n\r\n[227] A very \"gentle\" reader may perceive something _not_ quite\r\nexplained, and I should be happy to allow it.\r\n\r\n[228] And perhaps--though Mérimée does not allege this--by doing good to\r\nhis neighbours likewise; for he rescues twelve companions of his own\r\nnaughtiness from the infernal regions. The mixture of pagan and\r\nChristian eschatology, if not borrowed, is exceedingly well and suitably\r\n\"found.\"\r\n\r\n[229] He had at one time introduced a smirch of grime by which nothing\r\nwas gained and a good deal lost--the abduction being not at once cut\r\nshort, and the bear being suggested as the Count's actual sire (see\r\nBurton again). But he had the taste as well as the sense to cut this\r\nout. The management of the outsiders mentioned above contrasts\r\nremarkably in point of art with the similar things which, as noted (_v.\r\nsup._ pp. 93-4), do _not_ improve _Inès de las Sierras_.\r\n\r\n[230] He blue-spectacled, she black-veiled.\r\n\r\n[231] Uncarpeted and polished, French fashion, of course.\r\n\r\n[232] Mérimée represents his Englishman (and an Englishman who can read\r\nGreek, too!) as satisfied with, and ordering a second bottle of, an\r\nextemporised \"port\" made of ratafia, \"quinze sous\" _ordinaire_, and\r\nbrandy! This could deceive few Englishmen; and (till very recent years)\r\nabsolutely no Englishman who could read Greek at a fairly advanced\r\nperiod of life. From most of the French Novelists of the time it would\r\nnot surprise us; but from Mérimée, who was constantly visiting England\r\nand had numerous English friends, it is a little odd. It may have been\r\ndone _lectoris gratia_ (but hardly _lectricis_), to suit what even the\r\nother novelists just mentioned occasionally speak of as the _Anglais de\r\nvaudeville_.\r\n\r\n[233] I use this adverb from no trade-jealously: for I have made as many\r\ntranslations myself as I have ever wished to do, and have always been\r\nadequately paid for them. But there is no doubt that the competition of\r\namateur translation too often, on the one hand, reduces fees to sweating\r\npoint, and on the other affects the standard of competence rather\r\ndisastrously. I once had to review a version of _Das Kalte Herz_, in\r\nwhich the wicked husband persecuted his wife with a \"_pitcher_,\"\r\n_Peitsche_ being so translated by the light of nature, or the darkness\r\nof no dictionary.\r\n\r\n[234] Professed renderings of Spanish plays which never existed. _La\r\nGuzla_--a companion volume with an audacious anagrammatising of \"Gazul,\"\r\netc., etc.--is a collection of pure ballads similarly attributed to a\r\nnon-existent Slav poet, Hyacinthe Maglanovich. Both, in their influence\r\non the Romantic movement, were only second to the work of actual\r\nEnglish, German, and Spanish predecessors, and may rank with that of\r\nNodier.\r\n\r\n[235] Of the collection definitely called _Nouvelles_.\r\n\r\n[236] I have left the shortest story in the volume, _Croisilles_, to a\r\nnote. It has, I believe, been rather a favourite with some, but it seems\r\nto me that almost anybody could have written it, as far as anything but\r\nthe mere writing goes. Nor shall I criticise _Mimi Pinson_ and other\r\nthings at length. I cannot go so far as a late friend of mine, who\r\nmaintained that you must always praise the work of a writer you like.\r\nBut I think one has the option of silence--partial at any rate.\r\n\r\n[237] If anybody pleads for Louis Bertrand of _Gaspard de la Nuit_ as a\r\nthirdsman, I should accept him gladly, though he is even farther from\r\nthe novel-norm than Gérard himself. I once had the pleasure of bringing\r\nhim to the knowledge of the late Lord Houghton, who, the next time I met\r\nhim, ejaculated, \"I've got him, and covered him all over with moons and\r\nstars as he deserves.\" I hope Lord Crewe has the copy. (For Baudelaire's\r\nstill less novelish following of _Gaspard_, see below. As far as style\r\ngoes, both would enter this chapter \"by acclamation.\")\r\n\r\n[238] This has been already referred to above. After one of the\r\nabscondences or disappearances brought about by his madness, he was\r\nfound dead--hanging to a balcony, or outside stair, or lamp-post, or\r\nwhat not, in one of those purlieus of Old Paris which were afterwards\r\nswept away, but which Hugo and Méryon have preserved for us in different\r\nforms of \"black and white.\" Suicide, as always in such cases, is the\r\northodox word in this, and may be correct. But some of his friends were\r\ninclined to think that he had been the victim of pure murderous sport on\r\nthe part of the gangs of _voyous_, ancestors of the later \"apaches,\" who\r\ninfested the capital.\r\n\r\n[239] The quality will not be sought in vain by those who read Mr.\r\nLang's own poems--there are several--on and from Gérard.\r\n\r\n[240] \"Perhaps not, my dear; perhaps not.\"\r\n\r\n[241] What, I suppose, is the \"standard\" edition--that of the so-called\r\n_Oeuvres Complètes_--contains them all, but with some additions and more\r\nomissions to and from the earlier issues. And the individual pieces,\r\nespecially _Sylvie_, which is to be more fully dealt with here than any\r\nother, are subjected to a good deal of rehandling.\r\n\r\n[242] I may be taken to task for rendering _lisière_ \"fringes,\" but the\r\nactual English equivalent \"list\" is not only ambiguous, not only too\r\nhomely in its specific connotation, but wrong in rhythm. And \"selvage,\"\r\nescaping the first and last objections, may be thought to incur the\r\nmiddle one. Moreover, while both words signify a well-defined edge,\r\n_lisière_ has a sense--special enough to be noted in dictionaries--of\r\nthe looser-planted border of trees and shrubs which almost literally\r\n\"fringes\" a regular forest.\r\n\r\n[243] _Angélique_, which used to head _Les Filles du Feu_, in front of\r\n_Sylvie_, but was afterwards cut away by the editors of the _Oeuvres\r\nComplètes_ for reasons given under the head of _Les Faux Saulniers_\r\n(vol. iv. of that edition), is a specially Sternian piece, mixing up the\r\nchase for a rare book, and some other matters, with the adventures of a\r\nseventeenth-century ancestress of this book's author, who eloped with a\r\nservant, zigzagged as much as possible. It is quite good reading, but a\r\nlittle _mechanical_. Perhaps it is not too officious to remark that\r\n_Filles du Feu_ is to be interpreted here in the sense of our \"_Faces_\r\nin the fire.\"\r\n\r\n[244] Gérard was a slightly older man than Théo, but they were, as they\r\ncould not but be, close friends.\r\n\r\n[245] Even those who care little for mere beauty of style--or who cannot\r\nstand the loss of it in translation--may find here a vivid picture, by a\r\nhand of the most qualified, of the mental condition which produced the\r\nmasterpieces of 1825-1850. And the contrast with the \"discouraged\r\ngeneration\" which immediately followed is as striking.\r\n\r\n[246] Especially, it may be, if one has heard Galuppi's own music played\r\nby a friend who is himself now dead.\r\n\r\n[247] Some would make it a quintet with Leconte de Lisle, but I think\r\n\"the King should consider of it\" as to this. He is grand _sometimes_:\r\nbut so are Père Le Moyne and others. It is hit or miss with them; the\r\nFour can make sure of it.\r\n\r\n[248] It does, of course, deserve, and in this place specially should\r\nreceive, the credit of being the first French historical novel of the\r\nmodern kind which possessed great literary merit.\r\n\r\n[249] Alexander, though he actually wrote histories of a kind, was far\r\nbelow Alfred in political judgment.\r\n\r\n[250] _Vide infra_ on Dumas himself.\r\n\r\n[251] About Plato and Homer, who are very welcome, and \"Le Mensonge\r\nSocial,\" which is, perhaps, a little less so.\r\n\r\n[252] But see note 2 on next page.\r\n\r\n[253] One wonders if the Black Doctor was so sure of this on his own\r\ndeath-bed?\r\n\r\n[254] The first line of Gilbert's swan-song--the only song of his that\r\nis remembered. It sets Stello himself on the track which the \"Black\r\nDoctor\" has concealed up to the point. As the original rhythm could not\r\nbe kept without altering the substance, I have substituted another--not\r\nso unconnected as it may seem.--By the way, Vigny has taken as much\r\nliberty with French dates in this story as with English facts in the\r\nChatterton one. Gilbert died in 1780, and Louis XV. had passed from the\r\narms of his last mistress, Scarlatina Maligna, six years before, to be\r\nactually made the subject of a funeral panegyric by the poet. In fact,\r\nthe sufferings of the latter have been argued to be pure legend. But\r\nthis of course affects _literature_ hardly at all; and Vigny had a\r\nperfect right to use the accepted version.\r\n\r\n[255] Why should a \"basket\" be specially silly? The answer is that the\r\noriginal comparison was to a \"panier _percé_,\" a basket which won't hold\r\nanything. But the phrase got shortened.\r\n\r\n[256] He not only, in the face of generally known and public history,\r\nmakes the man who was positively insolent to George III. a flunky of\r\nroyalty, but assigns, as the immediate cause of the poet's suicide, the\r\noffer to him of a lucrative but menial office in the Mansion House! Now,\r\nif not history, biography tells us that Beckford's own death, and the\r\nconsequent loss of hope from him, were at least among the causes, if not\r\nthe sole cause, of the _subsequent_ catastrophe.\r\n\r\n[257] He has contrived, with the help of the gaoler's daughter Rose, to\r\nsuppress an earlier inclusion of Chénier's name in the tumbril-list; and\r\nthus might have saved him altogether, but for the father's insane\r\nreminder to Robespierre.\r\n\r\n[258] But she had to go backwards through the circles between Thermidor\r\nand Brumaire, and can hardly be said to have \"seen the stars\" even then.\r\nVigny has, as we shall see, touched on the less enormous and\r\nflagrant--but as individual things scarcely less atrocious--crimes of\r\nthe Directory in the first story of his next book.\r\n\r\n[259] There might of course have been spy-subordinates (cf. the case of\r\nD'Artagnan and Belleisle), with secret commissions to meet and render\r\nfutile his disobedience; but nothing of the sort is even hinted.\r\n\r\n[260] Vigny, with perfect probability, but whether with complete\r\nhistorical accuracy or not I do not know, represents this useless\r\nexposure as wanton bravado on Napoleon's part.\r\n\r\n[261] There may perhaps have been some private reasons for his\r\nenthusiasm. At any rate it is pleasant to compare it with the offensive\r\nmanner in which this \"heroic sailor-soul\" and admirably good man has\r\nsometimes been treated by the more pedantic kind of naval historian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE MINORS OF 1830\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is always a risk (as any one who remembers a somewhat ludicrous\r\noutburst of indignation, twenty or thirty years ago, among certain\r\nEnglish versemen will acknowledge) in using the term \"minor.\" But it is\r\ntoo useful to be given up; and in this particular case, if the very\r\ngreatest novelists are not of the company, there are those whose\r\ngreatness in other ways, and whose more than mediocrity in this, should\r\nappease the admirers of their companions. We shall deal here with the\r\nnovel work of Sainte-Beuve, the greatest critic of France; of Eugène\r\nSue, whose mere popularity exceeded that of any other writer discussed\r\nin this half of the volume except Dumas; of men like Sandeau, Charles de\r\nBernard, and Murger, whose actual work in prose fiction is not much less\r\nthan consummate in its own particular key and subdivisions; of one of\r\nthe best political satirists in French fiction, Louis Reybaud; and of\r\nothers still, like Soulié, Méry, Achard, Féval, Ourliac, Roger de\r\nBeauvoir, Alphonse Karr, Émile Souvestre, who, to no small extent\r\nindividually and to a very great extent when taken in battalion, helped\r\nto conquer that supreme reputation for amusingness, for pastime, which\r\nthe French novel has so long enjoyed throughout Europe. And these will\r\nsupply not a little material for the survey of the general\r\naccomplishment of that novel in the first half of the century, which\r\nwill form the subject of a \"halt\" or Interchapter, when Dumas\r\nhimself--the one \"major\" left, and left purposely--has been discussed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sainte-Beuve.--_Volupté._]\r\n\r\nWhen Sainte-Beuve, thirty years after the book first appeared, subjoined\r\na most curious Appendix to his only novel, _Volupté_, he included a\r\nletter of his own, in which he confesses that it is \"not in the precise\r\nsense a novel at all.\" It is certainly in some respects an outlier, even\r\nof the outlying group to which it belongs--the group of _René_ and\r\n_Adolphe_ and their followers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its \"puff-book.\"]\r\n\r\nI do not remember anything, even in a wide sense, quite like this\r\nAppendix--at least in the work of an author _majorum gentium_. It\r\nconsists of a series of extracts, connected by remarks of Sainte-Beuve's\r\nown, from the \"puff\"-letters which distinguished people had sent him, in\r\nrecompense for the copies of the book which he had sent _them_. Most\r\npeople who write have had such letters, and \"every fellow likes a hand.\"\r\nThe persons who enjoy being biographied expect them, I suppose, to be\r\npublished after their deaths; and I have known, I think, some writers of\r\n\"Reminiscences\" who did it themselves in their lifetimes. But it\r\ncertainly is funny to find the acknowledged \"first critic\" in the Europe\r\nor the world of his day paralleling from private sources the collections\r\nwhich are (quite excusably) added as advertisements from published\r\ncriticisms to later editions of a book. Intrinsically the things, no\r\ndoubt, have interest. Chateaubriand, whose _René_ is effusively praised\r\nin the novel, opens with an equally effusive but rather brief letter of\r\nthanks, not destitute of the apparent artificiality which, for all his\r\ngenius, distinguished that \"noble _Why_count,\" and perhaps, for all its\r\n\"butter,\" partly responsible for the _aigre-doux_ fashion in which the\r\nprais_ee_ subsequently treated the prais_er_. Michelet, Villemain, and\r\nNisard are equally favourable, and perhaps a little more sincere, though\r\nNisard (of course) is in trouble about Sainte-Beuve's divagations from\r\nthe style of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Brizeux applauds\r\nin prose _and_ verse. Madame de Castries (Balzac's \"Duchesse de\r\nLangeais\"), afterwards an intimate personal friend of the critic's,\r\nacknowledges, in an anonymous letter, her \"profound emotion.\" Lesser,\r\nbut not least, people like Magnin join. Eugénie de Guérin bribes her\r\nfuture eulogist. Madame Desbordes-Valmore, _the_ French poetess of the\r\nday, is enthusiastic as to the book: and George Sand herself writes a\r\ngood half-dozen small-printed and exuberant pages, in which the only\r\n(but repeated) complaint is that Sainte-Beuve actually makes his hero\r\nfind comfort in Christianity. Neither Lamartine (as we might have\r\nexpected) nor Lamennais (whose disciple Sainte-Beuve had tried to be)\r\nliked it; but Lacordaire did not disapprove.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Itself.]\r\n\r\nBefore saying anything more about it, let us give a brief argument of\r\nit--a thing which it requires more (for reasons to be given later) than\r\nmost books, whether \"precisely\" novels or not. It is the autobiographic\r\nhistory of a certain \"Amaury\" (whose surname, I think, we never hear),\r\naddressed as a caution to a younger friend, no name of whom we ever hear\r\nat all. The friend is too much addicted to the pleasures of sense, and\r\nAmaury gives him his own experience of a similar tendency. Despite the\r\nsubject and the title, there is nothing in the least \"scabrous\" in it.\r\nLacordaire himself, it seems, gave it a \"vu et approuvé\" as being\r\nsomething that a seminarist or even a priest (which Amaury finishes, to\r\nthe great annoyance of George Sand, as being) might have composed for\r\nedifying purposes. But the whole is written to show the truth of a\r\nquatrain of the Judicious Poet:\r\n\r\n    The wise have held that joys of sense,\r\n    The more their pleasure is intense,\r\n    More certainly demand again\r\n    Usurious interest of pain;\r\n\r\nthough the moral is enforced in rather a curious manner. Amaury is the\r\nonly, and orphan, representative of a good Norman or Breton family, who\r\nhas been brought up by an uncle, and arrives at adolescence just at the\r\ntime of the Peace of Amiens or thereabouts. He has escaped the\r\nheathendom which reigned over France a decade previously, and is also a\r\ngood Royalist, but very much \"left to himself\" in other ways.\r\nInevitably, he falls in love, though at first half-ignorant of what he\r\nis doing or what is being done to him. The first object is a girl,\r\nAmélie de Liniers, in every way desirable in herself, but unluckily not\r\nenough desired by him. He is insensibly divided from her by acquaintance\r\nwith the chief royalist family of the district, the Marquis and Marquise\r\nde Couaën, with the latter of whom he falls again in much deeper love,\r\nthough never to any guilty extent. She, who is represented as the real\r\n\"Elle,\" is again superseded, at least partially, by a \"Madame R.,\" who\r\nis a much less immaculate person, though the precise extent of the\r\nindulgence of their affections is left veiled. But, meanwhile, Amaury's\r\ntendency towards \"Volupté\" has, after his first visit to Paris, led him\r\nto indulge in the worship of Venus Pandemos, _parallèlement_ with his\r\nmore exalted passions. No individual object or incident is mentioned in\r\nany detail; and the passages relating to this side of the matter are so\r\nobscurely phrased that a very innocent person might--without stupidity\r\nquite equal to the innocence--be rather uncertain what is meant. But the\r\ntwin ravages--of more or less pure passion unsatisfied and wholly impure\r\nsatisfied appetite--ruin the patient's peace of mind. Alongside of this\r\nconflict there is a certain political interest. The Marquis de Couaën is\r\na fervent Royalist, and so willing to be a conspirator that he actually\r\ngets arrested. But he is an ineffectual kind of person, though in no\r\nsense a coward or a fool. Amaury meets with a much greater example of\r\n\"Thorough\" in Georges Cadoudal, and only just escapes being entangled in\r\nthe plot which resulted in the execution[262] of Cadoudal himself; the\r\npossible suicide but probable murder[262] of Pichegru, if not of others;\r\nthe kidnapping and unquestionable murder[262] of the Duc d'Enghien, and\r\nthe collapse of the career of Moreau. Some other real persons are\r\nbrought in, though in an indirect fashion. Finally, the conflict of\r\nflesh and spirit and the general tumult of feeling are too much for\r\nAmaury, and he takes refuge, through the seminary, in the priesthood.\r\nThe last event of the book is the death and burial of Madame de Couaën,\r\nher husband and Amaury somewhat melodramatically--and perhaps with a\r\nslight suggestion both of awkward allegory and possible\r\nburlesque--hammering literal nails into her coffin, one on each side.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the element of passion (both \"passion_ate_\" in the\r\nEnglish and \"passion_nel_\" in the French sense) and that of politics,\r\nthere is a good deal of more abstract theology and philosophy, chiefly\r\nof the mixed kind, as represented in various authors from Pascal--indeed\r\nfrom the Fathers--to Saint-Martin.[263]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its character in various aspects.]\r\n\r\nNow the book (which is undoubtedly a very remarkable one, whether it\r\ndoes or does not deserve that other epithet which I have seen denied to\r\nit, of \"interesting\") may be regarded in two ways. The first--as a\r\ndocument in regard to its author--is one which we have seldom taken in\r\nthis _History_, and which the present historian avoids taking as often\r\nas he can. Here, however, it may be contended (and discussion under the\r\nnext head will strengthen the contention) that it is almost impossible\r\nto do the book justice, and not very easy even to understand it, without\r\nsome consideration of the sort. When Sainte-Beuve published it, he had\r\nrun up, or down, a rather curious gamut of creeds and crazes. He had\r\nbeen a fervent Romantic. He had (for whatever mixture of reasons need\r\nnot be entered into here) exchanged this first faith, wholly or\r\npartially, for that singular _un_faith of Saint-Simonianism, which, if\r\nwe had not seen other things like it since and at the present day, would\r\nseem incredible as even a hallucination of good wits. He had left this\r\nagain to endeavour to be a disciple of Lamennais, and had, not\r\nsurprisingly, failed. He was now to set himself to the strange Herculean\r\ntask of his _Port-Royal_, which had effects upon him, perhaps stranger\r\nat first sight than on reflection. It left him, after these vicissitudes\r\nand pretty certainly some accompanying experiences adumbrated in\r\n_Volupté_ itself, \"L'oncle Beuve\" of his later associates--a\r\nfree-thinker, though not a violent one, in religion; a critic, never\r\nperhaps purely literary, but, as concerns literature and life combined,\r\nof extraordinary range, sanity, and insight; yet sometimes singularly\r\nstunted and limited in respect of the greatest things, and--one has to\r\nsay it, though there is no need to stir the mud as it has been stirred[264]\r\n--something of a \"porker of Epicurus.\"\r\n\r\nNow, with such additional light as this sketch may furnish, let us\r\nreturn to the book itself. I have said that it has been pronounced\r\n\"uninteresting,\" and it must be confessed that, in some ways, the author\r\nhas done all he could to make it so. In the first place it is much too\r\nlong; he has neglected the examples of _René_ and _Adolphe_, and given\r\nnearly four hundred solid and closely packed pages to a story with very\r\nlittle incident, very little description, only one solidly presented\r\ncharacter, and practically no conversation. There is hardly a novel\r\nknown to me from which the disadvantages of some more or less mechanical\r\nfault of presentation--often noticed in this _History_--could be better\r\nillustrated than from _Volupté_. I have called the pages \"solid,\" and\r\nthey are so in more than the general, more even than the technical\r\nprinter's sense. One might imagine that the author had laid a wager\r\nthat he would use the smallest number of paragraph-breaks possible.\r\nThere are none at all till page 6 (the fourth of the actual book);\r\nblocks of the same kind occur constantly afterwards, and more than one,\r\nor at most two, \"new pars\" are very rare indeed on a page. Even such\r\nconversation as there is is not extracted from the matrix of narrative,\r\nand the whole is unbroken _récit_.\r\n\r\nIt may seem that there is, and has been elsewhere, too much stress laid\r\nupon this point. But if I, who am something of a _helluo librorum_, and\r\nvery seldom find anything that resists my devouring faculty, feel this\r\ndifficulty, how much more must persons who require to be tempted and\r\nbaited on by mechanical and formal allurements?\r\n\r\nStill, some strong-minded person may say: \"These are 'shallows and\r\nmiseries'--base mechanical considerations. Tell me _why_ the book, as\r\nmatter, has been found uninteresting.\" In this instance there will be no\r\ndifficulty in complying with the request. Let me at once say that I do\r\nnot consider it uninteresting myself; that, in fact (and stronger\r\ntestimony is hardly possible), after reading great part of it without\r\nappetite and \"against the grain,\" I began to take a very considerable\r\ninterest in it. But this did not prevent my having a pretty clear notion\r\nof what seem to me faults of treatment, and even of conception, quite\r\nindependent of those already mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe main one is somewhat \"tickle of the sere\" to handle. It has been\r\nsaid that, despite its alarming title, there is nothing in the book that\r\neven prudery, unless it were of the most irritable and morbid kind,\r\ncould object to. There is no dwelling on what Defoe ingeniously calls\r\n\"the vicious part\" of the matter; there is no description of it closer\r\nthan, if as close as, some passages of the Book of Proverbs (which are\r\nactually quoted), and, above all, there is no hint of any satisfaction\r\nwhatever being derived from the sins by the sinner. His course in this\r\nrespect might have been a succession of fits of vertigo or epilepsy as\r\nfar as pleasure goes. There is even a rather fine piece of real\r\npsychology as to his state of mind after his first succumbing to\r\ntemptation. But all this abstinence and reticence, however laudable in a\r\nsense it may be, necessarily deprives the passages of anything but\r\npurely psychological interest, and leaves most of them not much of that.\r\nLuxury _in vacuo_ may, no doubt, be perilous to the culprit; but it has,\r\nfor others, nearly as much of the unreal and chimerical as Gluttony\r\nconfined to \"Second intentions.\"\r\n\r\nYet there is another objection to _Volupté_ which is even more closely\r\n\"psychological,\" and which has been indicated in the word\r\n\"parallèlement,\" suggested by, though largely transposed from,\r\nVerlaine's use thereof in a title. There is no connection\r\nestablished--there is even, it may seem, a great gulf fixed between\r\nAmaury's actual \"loves\" for Amélie de Liniers, for Lucy de Couaën, and\r\neven for the more questionable Madame R., and those \"sippings of the\r\nlower draught\" which are so industriously veiled. If Amaury had\r\n\"disdamaged\" himself, for his inability to possess any of his real and\r\nsuperior loves, by lower indulgences, it would have been discreditable\r\nbut human. But there is certainly no expression--there is, unless I\r\nmistake, hardly any suggestion--of anything of the kind. The currents of\r\nspiritual and animal passion seem to have run independently of each\r\nother, like canals at different heights on the slope of a hill. I do not\r\nknow that this is less discreditable; but it seems to me infinitely less\r\nhuman. And, while carefully abstaining from any attempt to connect the\r\npeculiarity with the above-mentioned scandals about Sainte-Beuve's life\r\nand conversation in detail, one may suggest that it offers some\r\nexplanation of the unquestioned facts about this; also (and this is of\r\ninfinitely more importance) of that absence of ability to love\r\nliterature in anything like a passionate way, which, with a certain\r\nother inability to love literature for itself, prevents him from\r\nattaining the absolutely highest level in criticism, though his command\r\nof ranges just below the highest is wider and firmer than that of any\r\nother critic on record.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jules Sandeau and Charles de Bernard.]\r\n\r\nWe may next take, to some extent together, two writers of the novel who\r\nmade their reputation in the July Monarchy, though one of them long\r\noutlived it; who, though this one inclined to a sort of domestic tragedy\r\nand the other to pure comedy, resembled each other not a little in\r\nclinging to ordinary life, and my estimate of whom is considerably\r\nhigher than that recently (or, I think, at present) entertained by\r\nFrench critics or by those English critics who think it right to be\r\nguided by their French _confrères_. This estimate, however, has been\r\ngiven at length in another place,[265] and I quite admit that the\r\nsubjects, though I have not in the least lowered my opinion of them, can\r\nhardly be said (like Gautier, Mérimée, Balzac, and Dumas, in the present\r\npart of this volume, or others later) to demand, in a general History,\r\nvery large space in dealing with them. I shall therefore endeavour to\r\nsummarise my corrected impressions more briefly than in those other\r\ncases. This shortening may, I think, be justified doubly: in the first\r\nplace, because any one who is enough of a student to want more can go to\r\nthe other handling; and, in the second, because the only excellent way,\r\nof reading the books themselves, may be adopted with very unusual\r\nabsence of any danger of disappointment. I hardly know any work of\r\neither Jules Sandeau or of Charles de Bernard which is not worth reading\r\nby persons of fairly catholic tastes in novel pastime.\r\n\r\nThe first-named--the younger by some half-dozen years, but the first to\r\npublish by more than as many--concerns those who take a merely or mainly\r\nanecdotic interest in literature by his well-known _liaison_ with George\r\nSand--to whom he gave _dimidium nominis_, and perhaps for a time at\r\nleast _dimidium cordis_, though he probably did not get it back so much\r\n\"in a worse estate\"[266] as was the case with Musset and Chopin.\r\nSandeau's collaboration with her in novel-writing was long afterwards\r\nsucceeded by another in dramaturgy with Émile Augier, which resulted in\r\nat least one of the most famous French plays of the nineteenth century,\r\n_Le Gendre de M. Poirier_, based on Sandeau's _Sacs et Parchemins_. But\r\nwe need busy ourselves only with the novels themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sandeau's work.]\r\n\r\nSandeau was barely twenty when he wrote _Rose et Blanche_, during the\r\ntime of, and with his partner in, that most dangerous of all possible\r\n_liaisons_. But he was nearly thirty when he produced his own first work\r\nof note, _Marianna_. In this, in _Fernand_, and in _Valcreuse_, all\r\nbooks above the average in merit, there is what may be called, from no\r\nmere Grundyite point of view, the drawback that they are all studies of\r\n\"the triangle.\" They are quite decently, and in fact morally, though not\r\ngoodily, handled. But it certainly may be objected that\r\ntrigonometry[267] of this kind occupies an exorbitant place in French\r\nliterature, and one may be a little sorry to see a neophyte of talent\r\ntaking to it. However, though Sandeau in these books showed his ability,\r\nhis way did not really lie _in_, though it might lie _through_, them. He\r\nhad, indeed, as a novelist should have, good changes of strings to his\r\nbow, if not even more than one or two bows to shoot in.\r\n\r\nNo Frenchman has written a better boy's book than _La Roche aux\r\nMouettes_, deservedly well known to English readers in translation: and\r\nwhether he did or did not enter into designed competition with his\r\n_quondam_ companion on the theme of Pastoral _berquinade_, I do not\r\nmyself think that _Catherine_ is much below _La Petite Fadette_ or _La\r\nMare au Diable_. He was a very considerable master of the short story;\r\nyou cannot have much better things of the kind than _Le Jour sans\r\nLendemain_ and _Un Début dans la Magistrature_. But his special gift lay\r\nin treating two situations which sometimes met, or crossed, or even\r\nsubstantially coincided. The one was the contrast of new and old,\r\nwhether from the side of actual \"money-bags and archives\" or from\r\nothers. The second and higher development of, or alternative to, this\r\nwas the working out of the subdued tragical, in which, short of the very\r\ngreat masters, he had few superiors, while the quietness of his tones\r\nand values even, enhances to some tastes the poignancy of the general\r\neffect. _Mlle. de La Seiglière_ is, I suppose, the best representative\r\nof the first class as a novel, for _Sacs et Parchemins_, as has been\r\nsaid, waited for dramatisation to bring out its merits. The pearls or\r\npinks of the other are _Mlle. de Kérouare_ and _La Maison de Penarvan_,\r\nthe latter the general favourite, the former mine. Both have admirably\r\nmanaged _peripeteias_, the shorter story (_Mlle. de Kérouare_) having,\r\nin particular, a memorable setting of that inexorable irony of Fate\r\nagainst which not only is there no armour, but not even the chance and\r\nconsolement of fighting armourless. When Marie de Kérouare accepts, at\r\nher father's wish, a suitor suitable in every way, but somewhat\r\nundemonstrative; when she falls in love (or thinks she does) with a\r\nhandsome young cousin; when the other aspirant loses or risks all his\r\nfortune as a Royalist, and she will not accept what she might have, his\r\nretirement, thereby eliciting from her father a _mot_ like the best of\r\nCorneille's;[268] when, having written to a cousin excusing herself, she\r\ngets a mocking letter telling her that _he_ is married already; when\r\nthe remorseless turn of Fortune's wheel loses her the real lover whom\r\nshe at last really does love--then it is not mere sentimental-Romantic\r\ntwaddle; it is a slice of life, soaked in the wine of Romantic\r\ntragedy.[269]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bernard's]\r\n\r\nIn Charles de Bernard (or, if anybody is unable to read novels published\r\nunder a pseudonym with sufficient comfort, Charles Bernard du Grail de\r\nla Villette[270]) one need not look for high passions and great actions\r\nof this kind. He does try tragedy sometimes,[271] but, as has been\r\nalready admitted, it is not his trade. Occasionally, as in _Gerfaut_, he\r\ntakes the \"triangle\" rather seriously _à la_\r\nGeorge-Sand-and-the-rest-of-them. The satirists have said that, though\r\nnot invariably (our present author contains cautions on that point) yet\r\nas a rule, if you take yourself with sufficient seriousness, mankind\r\nwill follow suit. It is certainly very risky to appear to take yourself\r\nnot seriously. _Gerfaut_, I believe, is generally held to be Bernard's\r\nmasterpiece. I remember that even my friend Mr. Andrew Lang, who seldom\r\ndiffered with me on points of pure literature, almost gravely\r\nremonstrated with me for not thinking enough of it. There are admirable\r\nthings in _Gerfaut_; but they are, as it seems to me, _separately_\r\nadmirable, and so are more like grouped short stories than like a whole\r\nlong novel. He wrote other books of substance, two of them, _Un\r\nBeau-père_ and _Le Gentilhomme Campagnard_, each extending to a brace of\r\nwell-filled volumes. But these, as well as the single-volume but still\r\nsubstantial _Un Homme Sérieux_ and _Les Ailes d'Icare_, like _Gerfaut_\r\nitself, could all, I think, be split up into shorter stories without\r\ndifficulty and with advantage. It is of course very likely that the\r\ncomparative slighting which the author has received from M. Brunetière\r\nand other French critics of the more theoretic kind is due to this. The\r\nstrict rule-system no doubt disapproves of the mere concatenation of\r\nscenes--still more of the mere accumulation of them.\r\n\r\nWe, on the other hand, _quibus est nihil negatum_, or who at any rate\r\ndeny nothing to our favourite authors so long as they amuse or interest\r\nus, ought to be--and some of the best as well as the not-best of us have\r\nbeen--very fond of Charles de Bernard. How frankly and freely Thackeray\r\npraised, translated, and adapted him ought to be known to everybody; and\r\nindeed there was a great similarity between the two. The Frenchman had\r\nnothing of Thackeray's strength--of his power of creating character; of\r\nhis intensity when he cared to be intense; of his satiric sweep and\r\n\"stoop\"; of his spacious view and masterly grasp of life. But in some\r\nways he was a kind of Thackeray several degrees underproof--a small-beer\r\nThackeray that was a very excellent creature. In his grasp of a pure and\r\nsimple comic situation; in his faculty of carrying this out decently to\r\nits appropriate end; and, above all, in the admirable quality of his\r\nconversation, he was really a not so very minor edition of his great\r\nEnglish contemporary. Almost the only non-technical fault that can be\r\nfound with him--and it has been found by French as well as English\r\ncritics, so there is no room for dismissing the charge as due to a\r\nmerely insular cult of \"good form\"--is the extreme unscrupulousness of\r\nsome of his heroes, who appear to have no sense of honour at all. Yet,\r\nin other ways, no French novelist of the century has obtained or\r\ndeserved more credit for drawing ladies and gentlemen. It has been\r\nhinted that the inability to do this has been brought as a charge\r\nagainst even the mighty Honoré,[272] and that, here at any rate, it has\r\nbeen found impossible to deny it absolutely. But if the company of the\r\nHuman Comedy falls short in this respect, it is not because some of its\r\nmembers do \"shady\" things. It is because the indefinable, but to those\r\nwho can perceive it unmistakable, _aura_ of \"gentility\"--in the true and\r\nnot the debased sense--is, at best, questionably present. This is not\r\nthe case with Bernard.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly difficult, in such a book as this, to deal with so\r\nlarge a collection of what may be most appropriately called \"Scenes and\r\nCharacters\" as that which constitutes his most valuable if not all his\r\nvaluable work. In the older handling referred to, I selected, for pretty\r\nfull abstract and some translation, _Un Homme Sérieux_ among longer\r\nbooks, and _Le Gendre_ among the short stories; and I still think them\r\nthe best, except _Le Pied d'Argile_, which, from Thackeray's\r\nincomparable adaptation[273] of it in _The Bedford Row Conspiracy_,\r\nremains as a standing possibility of acquaintance with Charles de\r\nBernard's way for those who do not read French, or do not care to\r\n\"research\" for the original. Thackeray also gave a good deal of _Les\r\nAiles d'Icare_ in abstract and translation, and he borrowed something\r\nmore from it in _A Shabby Genteel Story_. _La Peau du Lion_ and _La\r\nChasse aux Amants_ have some slight resemblance to _Le Gendre_, in that\r\nthe gist of all three is concerned with the defeat of unscrupulous\r\nlovers, and neither is much inferior to it. I never knew anybody who had\r\nread _La Femme de Quarante Ans_ and its history of sentimental\r\nstar-gazing _à deux_ without huge enjoyment; and _L'Arbre de la\r\nScience_, as well as the shorter _Un Acte de Vertu_, deserve special\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nBut, in fact, take the volumes entitled _L'Écueil_, _Le Noeud\r\nGordien_, _Le Paravent,_ and _Le Paratonnerre_; open any of them where\r\nyou like, and it will go hard but, in the comic stories at any rate, you\r\nwill find yourself well off. The finest of the tragic ones is, I think,\r\n_L'Anneau d'Argent_, which in utilising the sad inefficacy of the\r\nLegitimist endeavours to upset the July Monarchy, comes close to the\r\nalready-mentioned things of Sandeau and Ourliac.\r\n\r\nThat a critic like M. Brunetière should dismiss Bernard as \"commonplace\"\r\n(I forget the exact French word, but the meaning was either this or\r\n\"mediocre\"), extending something the same condemnation, or damningly\r\nfaint praise, to Sandeau, may seem strange at first sight, but explains\r\nitself pretty quickly to those who have the requisite knowledge. Neither\r\ncould, by any reasonable person, be accused of that _grossièreté_ which\r\noffended the censor so much, and to no small extent so rightly. Neither\r\nwas extravagantly unacademic or in other ways unorthodox. But both might\r\nbe called _vulgaire_ from the same point of view which made Madame de\r\nStaël so call her greatest contemporary as a she-novelist--one, too, so\r\nmuch greater than herself.[274] That is to say, they did deal with\r\nstrictly ordinary life, and neither attempted that close psychological\r\nanalysis and ambitious _schematism_ which (we have been told) is the\r\npride of the French novel, and which, certainly, some French critics\r\nhave supposed to be of its essence. These points of view I have left\r\nundiscussed for the most part, but have consistently in practice\r\ndeclined to take, in the first volume, while they are definitely opposed\r\nand combated in more than one passage of this.[275] I admit that\r\nSandeau, save in the one situation where I think he comes near to the\r\nfirst class--that of subdued resignation to calamity--is not passionate;\r\nI admit that Bernard has a certain superficiality, and that, as has been\r\nconfessed already, his \"form\" sometimes leaves to desire. But they both\r\nseem to me to have, in whatever measure and degree, what, with me, is\r\nthe article of standing or falling in novels--humanity. And they\r\nseem--also to me, and speaking under correction--to _write_, if not\r\nconsummately, far more than moderately well, and to _tell_ in a fashion\r\nfor which consummate is not too strong a word. While for pure gaiety,\r\nunsmirched by coarseness and unspoilt by ill-nature, you will not find\r\nmuch better pastime anywhere than in the work of the author of\r\n_L'Écueil_ and _Le Paratonnerre_.\r\n\r\nIndeed these two--though the _berquinade_ tendency, considerably\r\n_masculated_, prevails in one, and the _esprit gaulois_, decorously\r\ndraped, in the other--seem to me to run together better than any two\r\nother novelists of our company. They do not attempt elaborate analysis;\r\nthey do not grapple with thorny or grimy problems; they are not\r\npurveyors of the indecent, or dealers in the supernatural and fantastic,\r\nor poignant satirists of society at large or individuals in particular.\r\nBut they can both, in their different ways, tell a plain tale uncommonly\r\nwell, and season it with wit or pathos when either is suitable. Their\r\nmen and women are real men and women, and the stages on which they move\r\nare not _mere_ stages, but pieces of real earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sue, Soulié, and the novel of melodrama--_Le Juif Errant_,\r\netc.]\r\n\r\nAs regards one formerly almost famous and still well-known novelist,\r\nEugène Sue, I am afraid I shall be an unprofitable servant to such\r\nmasters in the guise of readers as desire to hear about him. For he is\r\none more of those--I do not think I have had or shall have to confess to\r\nmany--whom I have found it almost impossible to read. I acknowledge,\r\nindeed, that though at the first reading (I do not know how many years\r\nago) of his most famous work, _Le Juif Errant_, I found no merit in it\r\nat all, at a second, though I do not think that even then I quite got\r\nthrough it, I had to allow a certain grandiosity. _The Mysteries of\r\nParis_ has always defeated me, and I am now content to enjoy Thackeray's\r\nvery admirable _précis_ of part of it. Out of pure goodness and sheer\r\nequity I endeavoured, for the present volume, to make myself acquainted\r\nwith one of his later books--the immense _Sept Péchés Capitaux_, which\r\nis said to be a Fourierist novel, and explains how the vices may be\r\ninduced, in a sort of Mandeville-made-amiable fashion, to promote the\r\ngood of society. I found it what Mrs. Browning has made somebody\r\npronounce Fourier himself in _Aurora Leigh_, \"Naught!\"[276] except that\r\nI left them at the end actually committing an Eighth deadly sin by\r\ndrinking _iced_ Constantia![277] Sue, who had been an army surgeon and\r\nhad served during the Napoleonic war, both on land and at sea, wrote,\r\nbefore he took to his great melodramas, some rather extravagant naval\r\nnovels, which are simply rubbish compared with Marryat, but in\r\nthemselves not quite, I think, so difficult to read as his better known\r\nwork. I remember one in particular, but I am not certain whether it was\r\n_La Coucaratcha_ or _La Vigie de Koatven_. They are both very nice\r\ntitles, and I am so much afraid of disillusionment that I have thought\r\nit better to look neither up for this occasion.[278]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Melodramatic fiction generally.]\r\n\r\nThe fact is, as it seems to me, that the proper place for melodrama is\r\nnot the study but the stage. I fear I have uttered some heresies about\r\nthe theatre in this book, and I should not be sorry if I never passed\r\nthrough its doors again. If I must, I had rather the entertainment were\r\nmelodrama than anything else. The better the play is as literature, the\r\nmore I wish that I might be left to read it in comfort and see it acted\r\nwith my mind's eye only. But I can rejoice in the valiant curate when\r\n(with the aid of an avalanche, if I remember rightly) he triumphs over\r\nthe wicked baronet, who is treading on the fingers of the heroine as\r\nshe hangs over the precipice. I can laugh and applaud when the heroic\r\nmother slashes her daughter's surreptitious portrait in full Academy.\r\nThe object of melodrama is to make men rejoice and laugh; but it seems\r\nto me to require the stage to do it on, or at any rate to receive an\r\nimmense assistance from theatrical presentation. So given, it escapes\r\nthe curse of _segnius irritant_, because it attacks both ear and eye;\r\nbeing entirely independent of style (which _is_ in such cases actually\r\n_gênant_), it does not need the quiet and solitary devotion which\r\nenjoyment of style demands; and it is immensely improved by dresses and\r\n_décor_, scenery and music, and \"spectacle\" generally--all things which,\r\nagain, interfere with pure literary enjoyment. I shall hope to have\r\ndemonstrated, or at any rate done something to show, how Dumas, when at\r\nhis best, and even not quite at his best, escapes the actual\r\nmelodramatic. Perhaps this was because he had purged himself of the\r\nstagy element in his abundant theatric exercise earlier. Sue, of course,\r\ndramatised or got dramatised a considerable part of his many inventions;\r\nbut I think one can see that they were not originally stage-stuff.\r\n\r\nIf, however, any one must have melodrama, but at the same time does not\r\nwant it in stage form, I should myself recommend to him Frédéric Soulié\r\nin preference to Eugène Sue. Soulié is, indeed, a sort of blend of Dumas\r\nand Sue, but more melodramatic than the former, and less full of grime\r\nand purpose and other \"non-naturals\" of the novel than the latter. It is\r\nevident that he has taken what we may call his schedules pretty directly\r\nfrom Scott himself; but he has filled them up with more melodramatic\r\nmaterial. It is very noteworthy, too, that Soulié, like Dumas, turned\r\n_his_ stagy tastes and powers on to actual stage-work, and so kept the\r\ntwo currents duly separate. And it seems to be admitted that he had\r\nactual literary power, if he did not achieve much actual literary\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Château des Pyrénées._]\r\n\r\nFor myself, I think that _Le Château des Pyrénées_ is a thing, that in\r\nDe Quincey's famous phrase, you _can_ recommend to a friend whose\r\nappetite in fiction is melodramatic. Here is, if not exactly \"_God's_\r\nplenty,\" at any rate plenty of a kind--plenty whose horn is\r\ninexhaustible and the reverse of monotonous. You never, though you have\r\nread novels as the waves of the sea or the sands of the shore in number,\r\nknow exactly what is going to happen, and when you think you know what\r\nis happening, it turns out to be something else. Persons who wear, as to\r\nthe manner born, the jackets of lackeys turn out to be bishops; and\r\nbishops prove to be coiners. An important _jeune premier_ or\r\n_quasi-premier_, having just got off what seems to be imminent danger,\r\nis stabbed in the throat, is left for dead, and then carries out a\r\nseries of risky operations and conversations for several hours. A\r\ncastle, more than Udolphian in site, size, incidents, and opportunities,\r\nis burnt at a moment's notice, as if it were a wigwam. Everybody's sons\r\nand daughters are somebody else's daughters and sons--a state of things\r\nnot a little facilitated by the other fact that everybody's wife is\r\nsomebody else's mistress. Everybody knows something mysterious and\r\nexceedingly damaging about everybody else; and the whole company would\r\nbe cleared off the stage in the first few chapters if something did not\r\nalways happen to make them drop the daggers in a continual stalemate.\r\nDukes who are governors of provinces and peers of France are also heads\r\n(or think they are) of secret societies--the orthodox members of which\r\nchiefly do the coining, but are quite ignorant that a large number of\r\nother members are Huguenots (it is not long after the \"Revocation\") and\r\nare, in the same castle, storing arms for an insurrection. Spanish\r\ncounts who are supposed to have been murdered fifteen years ago turn up\r\nquite uninjured, and ready for the story to go on sixteen years longer.\r\nWhen you have got an ivory casket supposed to be full of all sorts of\r\ncompromising documents, somebody produces another, exactly like it, but\r\ncontaining documents more compromising still. There is a counsellor of\r\nthe Parliament of Toulouse--supposed to be not merely a severe\r\nmagistrate, but a man of spotless virtue, and one who actually submits\r\nfearlessly to great danger in doing his duty, but who turns out to be an\r\natrocious criminal. And in the centre of all the turmoil there is a\r\nwondrous figure, a sorcerer-shepherd, who is really an Italian prince,\r\nwho pulls all the strings, makes all cups slip at all lips, sets up and\r\nupsets all the puppets, and is finally poniarded by the wicked\r\ncounsellor, both of them having been caught at last, and the counsellor\r\ngoing mad after commission of his final crime.\r\n\r\nNow, if anybody wants more than this--there is, in fact, a great deal\r\nmore in the compass of two volumes,[279] containing between them less\r\nthan six hundred pages--all I can say is that he is vexatious and\r\nunreasonable, and that I have no sympathy whatever with him. Of course\r\nthe book is of its own kind, and not of another. Some people may like\r\nthat kind less than others; some may not like it at all. But in that\r\ncase nobody obliges them to have anything to do with it.\r\n\r\nSoulié wrote nearly two score novels or works of fiction, ranging from\r\n_Contes pour les Enfants_ to _Mémoires du Diable_. I do not pretend to\r\nhave read all or even very many of them, for, as I have confessed, they\r\nare not my special kind. In novels of action there should be a great\r\ndeal of fighting and a great deal of love-making, and it does not seem\r\nto me that either[280] was Soulié's forte. But as the _Mémoires_ are\r\nsometimes quoted as his masterpiece, something should, I suppose, be\r\nsaid about them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Les Mémoires du Diable._]\r\n\r\nOne thing about the book is certain--that it is much more ambitiously\r\nplanned than the _Château_; and I do not think it uncritical to say that\r\nthe ambition is, to a certain extent, successful. One credit, at any\r\nrate, can hardly be denied it. Considering the immense variety in\r\ncircumstances of the bargains with the Devil which are made in actual\r\nlife, it may seem strange that the literary treatment of the subject\r\nshould be so comparatively monotonous as it is. Soulié, I think, has\r\nbeen at least as original as anybody else, though it was of course\r\nalmost impossible for him to avoid suggestions, if not of Marlowe, of\r\nLesage, Goethe, Maturin (whose wide popularity in France at this time\r\nmust never be forgotten), and others. At the very beginning there is one\r\ntouch which, if not absolutely invented, is newish in the connection.\r\nThe Château of Ronquerolles, again in the Pyrenean district (besides the\r\nadvantages of a mountainous country, Soulié himself was born at Foix),\r\nhas a range of mysterious windows, each of which has for many\r\ngenerations emerged, with the room appertaining, from wall and corridor\r\nwithout anybody remembering it before.[281] As a matter of fact these\r\nchambers have been the scenes of successive bargains between the Lords\r\nof Ronquerolles and the Prince of Darkness; and a fresh one is opened\r\nwhenever the last inheritor of an ancestral curse (details of which are\r\nexplained later) has gone to close his account. The new Count de Luizzi\r\nknows what he has to do, which is to summon Satan by a certain little\r\nsilver bell at the not most usual but sufficiently witching hour of\r\n_two_ A.M., saying at the same time, \"Come!\" After a slightly trivial\r\nfarce-overture of apparitions in various banal forms, Luizzi compels the\r\nfallen archangel to show himself in his proper shape; and the bargain is\r\nconcluded after some chaffering. It again is not quite the usual form;\r\nthere being, as in Melmoth's case, a redemption clause, though a\r\ndifferent one. If the man can say and show, after ten years, that he has\r\nbeen happy he will escape. The \"consideration\" is also uncommon. Luizzi\r\ndoes not want wealth, which, indeed, he possesses; nor, directly,\r\npleasure, etc., which he thinks he can procure for himself. He wants\r\n(God help him!) to know all about other people, their past lives, their\r\ntemptations, etc.--a thing which a person of sense and taste would do\r\nanything, short of selling himself to the Devil, _not_ to know. There\r\nare, however, some apparently liberal, if discreditable,\r\nconcessions--that Luizzi may reveal, print, and in any other way avail\r\nhimself of the diabolic information. But, almost immediately, the\r\nmetaphorical cloven foot and false dice appear. For it seems that in\r\ncertain circumstances Luizzi can only rid himself of his ally when\r\nunwelcome, and perform other acts, at the price of forfeiting a month of\r\nhis life--a thing likely to abridge and qualify the ten years very\r\nconsiderably, and the \"happiness\" more considerably still.[282] And this\r\nfoul play, or at any rate sharp practice, continues, as might be\r\nexpected, throughout. The evil actions which Luizzi commits are not, as\r\nusual, committed with impunity as to ordinary worldly consequences,\r\nwhile he is constantly enlarging the debt against his soul. He is also\r\nalways getting into trouble by mixing up his supernatural knowledge with\r\nhis ordinary life, and he even commits murder without intending or\r\nindeed knowing it. This is all rather cleverly managed; though the\r\nend--the usual sudden \"foreclosure\" by Diabolus, despite the effort of\r\nno less than three Gretchens who go upwards, and of a sort of inchoate\r\nrepentance on Luizzi's own part before he goes downwards--might be\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe bulk, however, of the book, which is a very long one--three volumes\r\nand nearly a thousand closely printed pages--consists of the _histoires_\r\nor \"memoirs\" (whence the title) of other people which the Devil tells\r\nLuizzi, sometimes by actual _récit_, sometimes otherwise. Naturally they\r\nare most of them grimy; though there is nothing of the Laclos or even of\r\nthe Paul de Kock kind. I find them, however, a little tedious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Later writers and writings of the class.]\r\n\r\nThe fact, indeed, is that this kind of novel--as has been hinted\r\nsometimes, and sometimes frankly asserted--has its own peculiar\r\nappeals; and that these appeals, as is always the case when they are\r\npeculiar, leave some ears deaf. There is no intention here to intimate\r\nany superfine scorn of it. It has another and a purely literary, or at\r\nleast literary-scientific, interest as descending from the Terror Novel\r\nof the end of the eighteenth century. It shows no sign of ceasing to\r\nexist or to appeal to those to whom it is fitted to appeal, and who are\r\nfitted to be appealed to by it. Towards the close of the period at which\r\nI ceased to see French novels generally, I remember meeting with many\r\nexamples of it. There was one which, with engaging candour, called\r\nitself _L'Hôtellerie Sanglante_, and in which persons, after drinking\r\nwine which was, as Rogue Riderhood says, \"fur from a 'ealthy wine,\"\r\nretired to a rest which knew no or only a very brief and painful waking,\r\nunder the guardianship of a young person, who, to any one in any other\r\ncondition, would have seemed equally \"fur\" from an attractive young\r\nperson. There was another, the title of which I forget, in which the\r\nintended victim of a plunge into a water-logged _souterrain_ connected\r\nwith the Seine made his way out and saw dreadful things in the house\r\nabove. There is really no great interval or discrepancy (except in\r\ndetails of manners and morals) between these and the novels of\r\ndetective, gentleman-thief, and other impolite life which delight many\r\npersons indubitably respectable and presumably intelligent in England\r\nto-day.[283] To sneer at these would be ridiculous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murger.]\r\n\r\nHenry Murger is not the least of the witnesses to the truth of a\r\nremark--which I owe to one of the critics of my earlier volume--that in\r\nEngland people (he was kind enough to except me) are too apt to accept\r\nthe contemporary French estimates of French contemporary literature and\r\nthe traditional French estimates of earlier authors. Murger had, I\r\nbelieve, a hardly earned and too brief popularity in his own country;\r\nand though it was a little before my time, I can believe that this\r\noverflowed into England. But the posthumous and accepted judgments of\r\nhim altered _there_ to a sort of slighting patronage; and I remember\r\nthat when, nearly twenty years after his death, I wrote on him in the\r\n_Fortnightly Review_,[284] some surprise at my loftier estimate was\r\nexpressed _here_. The reasons for this depreciation are not hard to\r\ngive, and as they form a base for, and indeed really a part of, my\r\ncritical estimate they may be stated shortly. The \"Bohemia\"[285] of\r\nwhich Murger was the laureate, both in prose and verse, is a country\r\nwhose charms have been admitted by some of the greatest, but which no\r\nwise person has ever regarded, much less recommended, as providing any\r\ncity to dwell in; and which has certainly been the scene if not the\r\noccasion, not merely of much mischief, which does not particularly\r\nconcern us, but of much foolishness and bad taste, which partly does. It\r\nwas almost--not quite--the only theme of Murger's songs and words.\r\nAnd--last and perhaps most dangerous of all--there was the fact that, if\r\nnot in definite Bohemianism, there was in other respects a good deal in\r\nhim of a far minor Musset, and both in Bohemianism and other things\r\nstill more of an inferior Gérard de Nerval. I believe the case _against_\r\nhas been fairly stated here.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _Vie de Bohême_.]\r\n\r\nThe case _for_ I have put in the essay referred to with the full,\r\nthough, I think, not more than the fair emphasis allowed to even a\r\ncritical advocate when he has to demolish charges. The historian passes\r\nfrom bar to bench; and neither ought to speak, nor in this instance is\r\ninclined to speak, quite so enthusiastically. I admitted there that I\r\ndid not think Murger's comparatively early death lost us much; and I\r\nadmit even more frankly here, that in what he has left there is no great\r\nvariety of excellence, and that while there are numerous good things in\r\nthe work, there is little that can be called actually great. But after\r\nthese admissions no small amount remains to his credit as a writer who\r\ncan manage both comedy and pathos; who, if he has no wide range or\r\nvariety of subject, can vary his treatment quite efficiently, and who\r\nhas a certain freshness rarely surviving the first years of journalism\r\nof all work. His faintly but truly charming verse is outside our bounds,\r\nand even prose poetry like \"The Loves of a Cricket and a Spark of\r\nFlame\"[286] are on the line, though this particular thing is not far\r\nbelow Gérard himself. The longer novels, _Adeline Protat_ and _Le Sabot\r\nRouge_, are competent in execution and pleasant enough to read; yet they\r\nare not above good circulating-library strength. But the _Vie de\r\nBohême_, in its various sections, and a great number of shorter tales\r\nand sketches, are thoroughly agreeable if not even delightful. Murger\r\nhas completely shaken off the vulgarity which almost spoilt Pigault, and\r\ndamaged Paul de Kock not a little. If any one who has not yet reached\r\nage, or has not let it make him \"crabbed,\" cannot enjoy Schaunard and\r\nthe tame lobster; the philosophic humours of Gustave (afterwards His\r\nExcellency Gustave) Colline; the great journal _Le Castor_,[287] which\r\ncombined the service of the hat-trade with the promotion of high\r\nthinking and great writing; and the rest of the comedy of _La Vie de\r\nBohême_ proper, I am sorry for him. He must have been, somehow, born\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Les Buveurs d'Eau_ and the Miscellanies.]\r\n\r\nThe serious Bohemia of the _Buveurs d'Eau_ (the devotees of High Art who\r\ncarry their devotion to the point of contemning all \"commission\" work\r\nwhatsoever) may require more effort, or more special predestination, to\r\nget into full sympathy with it. The thing is noble; but it is nobility\r\n_party per_ a very thin _pale_ with and from silliness; and the Devil's\r\nAdvocate has no very hard task in suggesting that it is not even\r\nnobility at all, but a compound of idleness and affectation.[288] With\r\nrare exceptions, the greatest men of art and letters have never\r\ndisdained, though they might not love, what one of them called \"honest\r\njourney-work in default of better\"; and when those exceptions come to be\r\nexamined--as in the leading English cases of Milton[289] and\r\nWordsworth--you generally find that the persons concerned never really\r\nfelt the pinch of necessity. However, Murger makes the best of his\r\nLazare and the rest of them; and his power over pathos, which is\r\ncertainly not small, assists him as much here as it does _more_ than\r\nassist him--as it practically carries him through--in other stories such\r\nas _Le Manchon de Francine_ and _La Biographie d'un Inconnu_. And,\r\nmoreover, he can use all these means and more in handfuls of little\r\nthings--some mere _bleuettes_ (as the French call them)--_Comment on\r\nDevient Coloriste_, _Le Victime du Bonheur_, _La Fleur Bretonne_, _Le\r\nFauteuil Enchanté_, _Les Premières Amours du Jeune Bleuet_.\r\n\r\nWith such high praise still allotted to an author, it may seem unfair\r\nnot to give him more room; and I should certainly have done so if I had\r\nnot had the other treatment to refer to. Since that existed, as in the\r\nsimilar cases of Sandeau, Bernard, and perhaps one or two more, it\r\nseemed to me that space, becoming more and more valuable, might be\r\neconomised, especially as, in his case and theirs, there is nothing\r\nextraordinary to interest, nothing difficult to discuss. _Tolle_, _lege_\r\nis the suitable word for all three, and no fit person who obeys will\r\nregret his obedience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reybaud--_Jérôme Paturot_, and Thackeray on its earlier\r\npart.]\r\n\r\nAny one who attempts to rival Thackeray's abstract (\"_with_\r\ntranslations, Sir!\") of the first part of Louis Reybaud's _Jérôme\r\nPaturot_ must have a better conceit of himself than that with which the\r\npresent writer has been gifted, by the Divinity or any other power. The\r\nessay[290] in which this appears contains some of the rather rash and\r\nrandom judgments to which its great author was too much addicted; he had\r\nnot, for instance, come to his later and saner estimate of Dumas,[291]\r\nand still ranks him with Sue and Soulié. But the Paturot part itself is\r\nsimply delightful, and must have sent many who were not fortunate enough\r\nto know (or fortunate enough _not_ to know) it already to the book. This\r\nwell deserved and deserves to be known. Jérôme's own earlier career as a\r\nromantic and unread poet is not so brilliantly done as similar things in\r\nGautier's _Les Jeune-France_ and other books; but the Saint-Simonian\r\nsequel, in which so many _mil-huit-cent-trentiers_ besides Jérôme\r\nhimself and (so surprisingly) Sainte-Beuve indulged, is most capitally\r\nhit off. The hero's further experiences in company-meddling (with not\r\ndissimilar results to those experienced by Thackeray's own Samuel\r\nTitmarsh, and probably or certainly by Thackeray himself); and as the\r\neditor of a journal enticing the _abonné_ with a _bonus_, which may be\r\neither a pair of boots, a greatcoat, or a _gigot_ at choice; the\r\nside-hits at law and medicine; the relapse into trade and National\r\nGuardism; the visit to the Tuileries; the sad bankruptcy and the\r\nsubsequent retirement to a little place in the prefecture of a remote\r\ndepartment--all these things are treated in the best Gallic fashion, and\r\nwith a certain weight of metal not always achievable by \"Gigadibs, the\r\nliterary man,\" whether Gallic or Anglo-Saxon. Reybaud himself was a\r\nserious historian, a student of social philosophy, who has the\r\nmelancholy honour of having popularised, if he did not invent, the word\r\n\"Socialist\" and the cheerfuller one of having faithfully dealt with the\r\nthing Socialism. And Jérôme is well set off by his still more\r\n\"Jeune-France\" friend Oscar, a painter, not exactly a bad fellow, but a\r\n_poseur_, a dauber (he would have been a great Futurist or Cubist\r\nto-day), a very Bragadochio in words and flourish, and, alas! as he\r\nturns out presently, a Bragadochio also in deeds and courage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The windfall of Malvina.]\r\n\r\nBut the gem of the book perhaps, as far as good novel-matter is\r\nconcerned (for Jérôme himself is not much more than a stalking-horse for\r\nsatire), is Malvina, his first left-handed and then \"regularised\"\r\nspouse, and very much his better half. Malvina is Paul de Kock's\r\ngrisette (like all good daughters, she is very fond of her literary\r\nfather) raised to a higher power, dealt with in a satiric fashion\r\nunknown to her parent, but in perfectly kindly temper. She is, though\r\njust a little imperious, a thoroughly \"good sort,\" and, with occasional\r\nblunders, really a guardian angel to her good-hearted, not uncourageous,\r\nbut visionary and unpractical lover and husband. She has the sharpest of\r\ntongues; the most housewifely and motherly of attitudes; the flamingest\r\nof bonnets. It is she who suggests Saint-Simonianism (as a resource, not\r\nas a creed), and actually herself becomes a priestess of the first\r\nclass--till the funds give out. She, being an untiring and unabashed\r\ncanvasser, gets Jérôme his various places; she reconciles his\r\nnightcap-making uncle to him; she, when the pair go to the Palace and he\r\nis basely occupied with supper, carries him off in dudgeon because none\r\nof the princes (and in fact nobody at all) has asked her to dance. And\r\nwhen at last he subsides upon his shelf at the country prefecture, she\r\nbecomes delightfully domesticated--and keeps canaries.\r\n\r\nThe book (at least its first two parts) appeared in 1843, when the July\r\nMonarchy was still in days of such palminess as it ever possessed, and\r\nThackeray reviewed it soon after. At the close of his article he\r\nexpressed a hope that M. Reybaud \"had more of it, in brain or portfolio,\r\nfor the benefit of the lazy, novel-reading, unscientific world.\"\r\nWhether, at that time, the hope was in course of gratification I do not\r\nknow; but years later, when February had killed July, Thackeray's wish\r\nwas granted. It cannot be said that, as too often happens with wishes,\r\nthe result was entirely disappointing; but it certainly justified the\r\nfamous description of a still larger number of them, in that only half\r\nwas granted and the rest \"whistled down the wind.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The difference of the Second Part.]\r\n\r\n_Jérôme Paturot à la recherche de la meilleure des Républiques_ almost\r\ndooms itself, by its title, to be a very much less merry book than\r\n_Jérôme Paturot à la recherche d'une position sociale_. The \"sparkle\"\r\nwhich Thackeray had justly seen in the first part is far rarer in the\r\nsecond; in fact, were it not for Oscar to some extent and Malvina to a\r\nmuch greater, there would hardly be any sparkle at all. The Republic has\r\nbeen proclaimed; a new \"Commissary\" (\"Prefect\" is an altogether\r\nunrepublican word) is appointed; he is shortly after stirred up to\r\nvigorous action (usually in the way of cashiering officials), and Jérôme\r\nis a victim of this _mot d'ordre_. He goes to Paris to solicit; after a\r\ncertain interval (of course of failure) Malvina comes to look after him,\r\nand to exercise the charms of her _chapeau grénat_ once more. But even\r\nshe fails to find the birds which (such as they were) she had caught in\r\nthe earlier years' nests, until after the bloodshed of the barricades,\r\nwhere Oscar unfortunately fails to show himself a hero, while Jérôme\r\ndoes useful work as a fighter on the side of comparative Order, and\r\nMalvina herself shines as a nurse. At last Paturot is appointed\r\n\"Inspector-General of Arab Civilisation in North Africa,\" and the pair\r\nset out for this promised, if not promising, land. He, like Gigadibs,\r\nprovides himself with \"instruments of labour\"; Malvina, agreeable to the\r\nlast, provides _herself_ with several new dress-patterns of the latest\r\nfashion, and a complete collection of the _Journal des Modes_.\r\n\r\nThis not very elaborate scenario, as worked out, fills nearly a thousand\r\npages; but it is very much to be feared that the \"lazy novel-reader\"\r\nwill get through but a few of them, and will readily return the book to\r\nhis own or other library shelves. It is, in fact, a bitterly satiric but\r\nperfectly serious study--almost history--of the actual events of the\r\nearlier part of the interregnum between Louis Philippe and Napoleon the\r\nThird, of the latter of whom Reybaud (writing, it would seem, before he\r\nwas even President), gives a very unflattering, though unnamed,\r\ndescription. Certainly more than half, perhaps more than three-quarters,\r\nof the book can claim no novel character at all.[292]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Not much of a novel.]\r\n\r\nIt would be possible to extract (if one had space and it were\r\nproportionately worth while) passages from the remaining portion of very\r\nfair novel interest--the visit of the \"Super-Commissary\" to the\r\nCommissary; the history of the way in which, under the _régime_ of that\r\n_atelier national_ which some wiseacres want now with us, a large body\r\nof citizens was detailed to carry trees of liberty from a nursery garden\r\nin the suburbs of Paris to the _boulevards_; how these were uprooted\r\nwithout any regard to their arboreal welfare; how the national\r\nworking-men got mainly drunk and wholly skylarky on the way, and how the\r\nunfortunate vegetables were good for nothing but firewood by the time\r\nthey reached their destination; the humours of the open-air feast of the\r\nRepublic; the storming of the Assembly by the clubs; the oratory of\r\nMalvina (a very delectable morsel) in one of the said clubs devoted to\r\nthe Rights of Women;[293] the scene where Oscar, coming by his own\r\naccount from the barricades \"with his hands and his feet and his raiment\r\nall red,\" manifests a decided disinclination to return thither--all\r\nthese are admirable. But they would have to be dug out of a mass of\r\nhistory and philosophy which the \"lazy novel-reader\" would, it is to be\r\nfeared, refuse with by no means lazy indignation and disgust.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: But an invaluable document.]\r\n\r\nYet one may venture, at the risk of the charge of stepping out of one's\r\nproper sphere, to recommend the perusal of the book, very strongly, to\r\nall who care either to understand its \"moment\" or to prepare themselves\r\nfor other moments which are at least announced as certain to come. The\r\nFrench revolutionary period of 1848 and the following years was perhaps\r\nthe most perfect example in all history of a thing being allowed to show\r\nitself, in all its natural and therefore ineluctable developments,\r\nwithout disturbing influences of any kind. It was (if one may use\r\npatristic if not classical Latin in the first word of the phrase)\r\n_Revolutio sibi permissa_. There was, of course, a good deal of somewhat\r\nsimilar trouble elsewhere in Europe at the time; but there was no\r\nEuropean war of much importance, and no other power threatened or was in\r\na position to threaten interference with French affairs--for the\r\nexcellent reason that all were too much occupied with their own. There\r\nwas no internal tyranny or trouble such as had undoubtedly caused--and\r\nas has been held by some to justify--the outburst of sixty years\r\nearlier, nor was there even any serious, though perhaps there was some\r\nminor, maladministration. But there had been, for twenty years, a weak,\r\namorphous, discreditable, and discredited government; and there was a\r\ngreat deal of revolutionary spirit, old and new, about. So France\r\ndetermined--in a word unacademic but tempting--to \"revolute,\" and she\r\n\"revoluted\" at discretion, or indiscretion, to the top of her bent. This\r\npart of _Jérôme Paturot_ gives a minute and (having had a good deal to\r\ndo with the study both of history and of politics in my time), I think I\r\nmay say boldly, a faithful account of _how_ she did it. And I think,\r\nfurther, that, if at least some of the innocent folk who the other day\r\nhailed the dawn of the Russian revolution had been acquainted with the\r\nbook, they might have been less jubilant; while acquaintance would have\r\nhelped others to anticipate the actual consequences. And I wish that\r\nsome one would, in some form or other, bring its contents before those\r\nwho, without being actual scoundrels, utter fanatics, or hopeless\r\nfools, want to bring revolution nearer home. Reybaud brings out, too\r\nverbosely and heavily perhaps, but with absolute truth and justice, the\r\nwaste, the folly, the absolute illogicality of the popular cries,\r\nmovements, everything. \"Labour\" was, happily, not then organised in\r\nFrance as it is in England to-day. But if any one would extract, and\r\ntranslate in a pamphlet form, the dying speech of the misguided tool\r\nComtois in reference to his misleader, the typical \"shop-steward\"\r\nPercheron, he would do a mighty good deed.\r\n\r\nStill, of course this is a parenthesis; and the parenthesis is a thing\r\nhateful, I am told, perhaps not to gods but to some men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStudents of literature, even in a single language, much more in wider\r\nrange, are well acquainted with a class of writers, largely increased\r\nsince the introduction of printing, and more largely still since that of\r\n\"periodicals,\" who enjoy a considerable--sometimes almost a\r\ngreat--reputation in their own time, and then are not so much\r\ndiscredited or disapproved as simply forgotten. They disappear, and\r\ntheir habitation is hardly even the dust-bin; it is the _oubliette_; and\r\ntheir places are taken by others whose fates are _not_ other. In fact,\r\nthey are, in the famous phrase, \"Priests who slay the slayer,\" etc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Méry.]\r\n\r\nOf these, in French, I myself hardly know a more remarkable example than\r\nJoseph Méry, who, born two years before the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, lived for just two-thirds of the nineteenth, wrote, from a very\r\nearly age till his death, in prose and in verse and in drama; epics,\r\nsatires, criticisms, novels, travels, Heaven knows what; who had the\r\nreputation of being one of the most brilliant talkers of his day; who\r\ncollaborated[294] with Gautier and Gérard de Nerval and Sandeau and Mme.\r\nde Girardin, and other people much greater than himself; from whose pen\r\nthe beloved old \"Collection Michel Lévy\" contained at least thirty\r\nvolumes at the date of his death--the wreckage of perhaps a possible\r\nthree hundred--and of whom, though I have several times in the\r\nhalf-century since dived into his work, I do not think I can find a\r\nsingle story of first, second, or even third-rate quality.[295]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Les Nuits Anglaises._]\r\n\r\nAs it happens, one volume of his, _Les Nuits Anglaises_, contains\r\nexamples of his various manners, some of which may be noticed. Not all\r\nof them are stories, but it is fair to throw in a non-story because it\r\nis so very much better than the others. This is a \"physionomie\" of\r\nManchester, written, it would seem, just at the beginning of the reign\r\nof Queen Victoria; and it shows that Méry, as a writer of those middle\r\narticles or transformed _Spectator_ essays, which have played so large a\r\npart in the literature of the last century and a quarter, was not quite\r\na negligible person. Moreover, the sort of thing, though not essential\r\nto the novelist's art, is a valuable tool at his disposal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The minor stories.]\r\n\r\nBut here the author, who was a considerable traveller and not a bad\r\njudge of art, was to a large extent under the grip of fact: when he got\r\ninto fiction he exhibited a sad want of discipline. One must allow\r\nsomething, no doubt, for the fact that the _goguenard_ element is\r\navowedly strong in him. The second English Night, with its Oxfordshire\r\nelection (he has actually got the name of \"Parker\" right, though\r\nWoodstock wobbles from the proper form to \"Woostock,\" \"Wostoog,\" etc.)\r\nand its experiences of an Indian gentleman who is exposed at Ellora\r\n(near Madras) to the influence of the upas tree, by a wicked emissary of\r\nthe Royal Society, Sir Wales, as a scientific experiment; and the last,\r\nwhere two Frenchmen, liberated from the hulks at the close of the\r\nNapoleonic War, make a fortune by threatening to blow up the city of\r\nDublin; may sue out their writ of ease under the statute of\r\nGoguenarderie. A third half-Eastern, half-English story (Méry was fond\r\nof the East), _Anglais et Chinois_, telling quite delicately the\r\nsurprising adventures of a mate of H.M.S. _Jamesina_[296] in a sort of\r\nChinese harem, has some positive merit, though it is too long. The\r\nlongest and most ambitious tale, _Histoire d'une Colline_, if not\r\n\"wholly serious\" (as a famous phrase has it), seems to aim at a good\r\ndeal of seriousness. Yet it is, as a matter of fact, rather more absurd\r\nthan the pure extravaganzas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Histoire d'une Colline._]\r\n\r\nSir John Lively--who appears neither to have inherited the title (seeing\r\nthat his sainted father, a victim of English tyranny, was named Arthur\r\nO'Tooley, perhaps one of the tailors of that ilk) nor to have paid M.\r\nMéry five or ten thousand pounds for it--is an Irishman of the purest\r\nvirtue and the noblest sentiments, who possesses a cottage on a hill not\r\nfar from the village and castle of Stafford. From this interesting\r\nheight there are two views: one over the beautiful plains of Lancashire,\r\nanother towards the brumous mountains of Oxfordshire. Lively always\r\nlooks this latter way, because in coming from London he has seen, at the\r\nother village of Bucks, a divine creature who dispenses soda-water and\r\nsome stronger liquors to the thirsty. She, like the ninepenny kettle of\r\nthe song, \"is Irish _tu_,\" and belongs to the well-known sept of the\r\nO'Killinghams. They are both fervent Roman Catholics (Méry is\r\nastoundingly severe on our \"apostate\" church, with its \"insulted\" Saint\r\nPaul's and Saint Martin's). She is also persecuted by an abominable\r\nEnglish landlord, Mr. Igoghlein. The two meet at mass in \"_the_ Catholic\r\nChurch of the City,\" to which, \"as in the time of Diocletian\" (slightly\r\naltered to 1830-40), \"a few faithful ones furtively glide, and seem to\r\nbe in fear.\" To get money, Lively gambles, and (this is the sanest part\r\nof the book, for the reason that things went on in much the same way at\r\nParis and at London) is cheated. But the cottage, and the hill with such\r\ncommanding views, are discovered to be in the way of a new line and to\r\nconceal coal. He sells them to a Mr. Copperas; marries the beautiful\r\nO'Killingham; the bells of Dublin ring head over heels, \"and Ireland\r\nhopes.\" Let it also be mentioned that in the course of the story we are\r\nmore than once told of the double file of Mauresque, Spanish, Gothic,\r\nand Italian _colonnades_ which line the marvellous High Street of\r\nOxford; and that Mr. Copperas visited that seat of learning to consult\r\nan expert in railways[297] and see his three largest shareholders. (Oh,\r\nthese bloated dons!) That three members of \"the society of _ti_total\r\nabstinence\" drank, at the beautiful O'Killingham's cottage, twenty pints\r\nof porter (White-bread), two flagons of whisky, and three of claret, may\r\nmeet with less incredulity, though the assortment of liquor is barbarous\r\nand the quantity is certainly large. But let us turn from this nonsense\r\nto the remarkable Manchester article.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Manchester\" article.]\r\n\r\nIt was not for some thirty years later than Méry's visit that I myself\r\nknew, and for some time lived in, the new-made \"city,\" as it became, to\r\nthe horror of Mr. Bright, just before Méry saw it. But though there must\r\nhave been many changes in those thirty years, they were nothing to those\r\nwhich have taken place in the fifty that have passed subsequently. And I\r\ncan recognise the Manchester I knew in Méry's sketch. This may seem to\r\nbe at first an exceedingly moderate compliment--in fact something close\r\nto an insult. But it is nothing of the kind. It is true that there is\r\nconsiderable _naïveté_ in a sentence of his own: \"En général les\r\nnationaux sont fort ignorants sur les phénomènes de leur pays; il faut\r\ns'adresser aux étrangers pour en obtenir la solution.\" And it is also\r\ntrue that our \"nationals,\" at that time and since, have been\r\nexcessively ignorant of phenomena which the French tourists of Louis\r\nPhilippe's reign discovered here, and surprised, not to say diverted, at\r\nthe solutions thereof preferred by these obliging strangers. That Méry\r\nhad something of the Michiels[298] in him, what has been said above\r\nshould show. But in some strange way Manchester--foggiest and rainiest\r\nof all our industrial hells,[299] except Sheffield--seems to have made\r\nhis brain clear and his sight dry, even in drawing a sort of\r\nhalf-Rembrandt, half-Callot picture. He takes, it is true, some time in\r\nfreeing himself from that obsession by one of our _not_-prettiest\r\ninstitutions, \"street-walking,\" which has always beset the French.[300]\r\nBut he does get clear, and makes a striking picture of the great\r\nthoroughfares of Market Street and Piccadilly; of the view--a wonderful\r\none certainly, and then not interfered with by railway viaducts--from\r\nand of the Cathedral; and of the extraordinary utilisation of the scanty\r\n\"naval\" capabilities of Irk and Irwell and Medlock. But, as has been\r\nsaid, such things are at best but accidents of the novel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Karr.]\r\n\r\nIf not much is found here about Alphonse Karr, it is certainly not\r\nbecause the present writer undervalues his general literary position. As\r\na journalist and miscellanist, Karr had few superiors in a century of\r\nmiscellaneous journalism; and as a maker of telling and at the same time\r\nsolid phrase, he was Voltaire's equal in the first respect and his\r\nsuperior in the second. The immortal \"Que MM. les assassins commencent,\"\r\nalready referred to, is perhaps the best example in all literature of\r\nthe terse _argumentum joculare_ which is not more sparkling as a joke\r\nthan it is crushing as an argument; \"Plus ça change plus c'est la même\r\nchose\"[301] is nearly as good; and if one were writing a history, not of\r\nthe novel, but of journalism or essay-writing of the lighter kind, Karr\r\nwould have high place and large room. But as a novelist he does not seem\r\nto me to be of much importance, nor even as a tale-teller, except of the\r\nanecdotic kind. He can hardly be dull, and you seldom read him long\r\nwithout coming to something[302] refreshing in his own line; but his\r\ntales, as tales, are rarely first-rate, and I do not think that even\r\n_Sous les Tilleuls_, his best-known and perhaps best production, needs\r\nmuch delay over it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Roger de Beauvoir--_Le Cabaret des Morts_.]\r\n\r\nRoger de Beauvoir (whose _de_ was genuine, but who embellished \"Bully,\"\r\nhis actual surname, into the one by which he was generally known) also\r\nhad, like Bernard and Reybaud, the honour of being noticed, translated,\r\nand to some extent commented on by Thackeray.[303] I have, in old times,\r\nread more of his novels than I distinctly remember; and they are not\r\nvery easy to procure in England now. Moreover, though he was of the\r\nright third or fourth _cru_ of _mil-huit-cent-trente_, there was\r\nsomething wanting in his execution. I have before me a volume of short\r\nstories, excellently entitled (from the first of them) _Le Cabaret des\r\nMorts_. One imagines at once what Poe or Gautier, what even Bulwer or\r\nWashington Irving, would have made of this. Roger (one may call him this\r\nwithout undue familiarity, because it is the true factor in both his\r\nnames) has a good idea--the muster of defunct painters in an ancient\r\nAntwerp pot-house at ghost-time, and their story-telling. The contrast\r\nof them with the beautiful _living_ barmaid might have been--but is\r\nnot--made extremely effective. In fact the fatal improbability--in the\r\nAristotelian, not the Barbauldian sense--broods over the whole. And the\r\nCabaret des Morts itself ceases, not in a suitable way, but because the\r\nBurgomaster shuts it up!!! All the other stories--one of Marie\r\nAntoinette's Trianon dairy; another of an anonymous pamphlet; yet\r\nanother of an Italian noble and his use of malaria for vengeance; as\r\nwell as the last, told by a Sister of Mercy while watching a\r\npatient--miss fire in one way or another, though all have good subjects\r\nand are all in a way well told. It is curious, and might be made rather\r\ninstructive by an intelligent Professor of the Art of Story-telling, who\r\nshould analyse the causes of failure. But it is somewhat out of the way\r\nof the mere historian.[304]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ourliac--_Contes du Bocage_.]\r\n\r\nÉdouard Ourliac, one of the minor and also one of the shorter-lived men\r\nof 1830, seems to have been pleasant in his life--at least all the\r\npersonal references to him that I remember to have seen, in a long\r\ncourse of years, were amiable; and he is still pleasant in literature.\r\nHe managed, though he only reached the middle of the road, to accumulate\r\nwork enough for twelve volumes of collection, while probably more was\r\nuncollected. Of what I have read of his, the _Contes_ and _Nouveaux\r\nContes du Bocage_--tales of La Vendée, with a brief and almost\r\nbrilliant, certainly vivid, sketch of the actual history of that\r\nglorious though ill-fated struggle--deserve most notice. Two of the\r\n_Nouveaux Contes_, _Le Carton D._ (a story of the rescue of her husband\r\nby a courageous woman, with the help of the more amiable weaknesses of\r\nthe only amiable Jacobin leader, Danton) and _Le Chemin de Keroulaz_\r\n(one of treachery only half-defeated on the Breton coast), may rank with\r\nall but the very best of their kind. In another, _Belle-Fontaine_,\r\npeople who cannot be content with a story unless it instructs their\r\nminds on points of history, morality, cosmogony, organo-therapy, and\r\neverything _quod exit in y_, except jollity and sympathy, may find a\r\nsection on the youth of 1830--really interesting to compare with the\r\nmuch less enthusiastic account by Gérard de Nerval, which is given\r\nabove. And those who like to argue about cases of conscience may be glad\r\nto discuss whether Jean Reveillère, in the story which bears his name,\r\n_ought_ to have spared, as he actually did, the accursed\r\n_conventionnel_, who, after receiving shelter and care from women of\r\nJean's family, had caused them to be massacred by the _bleus_, and then\r\nagain fell into the Vendéan's hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut, with one or two more notices, we must close this chapter.\r\n\r\nAlthough Dumas, by an odd anticipatory reversal of what was to be his\r\nson's way, spent a great deal of time on more or less trashy[305] plays\r\nbefore he took to his true line of romance, and so gave opportunity to\r\nothers to get a start of him in the following of Scott, it was\r\ninevitable that his own immense success should stir emulation in this\r\nkind afresh. In a way, even, Sue and Soulié may be said to belong to the\r\nclass of his unequal competitors, and others may be noticed briefly in\r\nthis place or that. But there is one author who, for one book at least,\r\nbelonging to the successors rather than the _avant-coureurs_, but\r\ndecidedly of the pre-Empire kind, must have a more detailed mention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Achard.]\r\n\r\nMany years ago somebody was passing the small tavern which, dating for\r\naught I know to the times of Henry Esmond, and still, or very lately,\r\nsurviving, sustained the old fashion of a thoroughfare, fallen, but\r\nstill fair, and fondly loved of some--Kensington High Street, just\r\nopposite the entrance to the Palace. The passer-by heard one loiterer in\r\nfront of it say to his companion in a tone of emotion, and almost of\r\nawe: \"There was beef, and beer, and bread, and greens, and _everything\r\nyou can imagine_.\" This _pheme_ occurred to me when, after more than\r\nhalf a century, I read again Amédée Achard's _Belle-Rose_. I had taken\r\nit up with some qualms lest crabbed age should not confirm the judgment\r\nof ardent youth; and for a short space the extreme nobility of its\r\nsentiments did provoke the giggle of degeneracy. But forty of the little\r\npages of its four original volumes had not been turned when it reassured\r\nme as to the presence of \"beef, and beer, and bread, and greens, and\r\neverything you can imagine\" in its particular style of romance. The\r\nhero, who begins as a falconer's son and ends as a rich enough colonel\r\nin the army and a Viscount by special grace of the Roi Soleil, is a\r\n_sapeur_, but far indeed from being one of those graceless comrades of\r\nhis to whom nothing is sacred. At one time he does indeed succumb to the\r\nsorceries of a certain Geneviève de Châteaufort, a duchess _aux narines\r\nfrémissantes_. But who could resist this combination? even if there were\r\na marquise of the most beautiful and virtuous kind, only waiting to be a\r\nwidow in order to be lawfully his. Besides, the Lady of the Quivering\r\nNostrils becomes an abbess, her rather odd abbey somehow accommodating\r\nnot merely her own irregularly arrived child (_not_ Belle-Rose's), but\r\nBelle-Rose himself and his marchioness after their marriage; and she is\r\npoisoned at the end in the most admirably retributive fashion. There are\r\nactually two villains--a pomp and prodigality (for your villain is a\r\nmore difficult person than your hero) very unusual--one of whom is\r\ndespatched at the end of the second volume and the other at the actual\r\ncurtain. There is the proper persecuting minister--Louvois in this case.\r\nThere are valiant and comic non-commissioned officers. There is a brave,\r\nwitty, and generous Count; a lover of the \"fatal\" and ill-fated kind;\r\nhis bluff and soldierly brother; and more of the \"affair of the poisons\"\r\nthan even that mentioned above. You have the Passage of the Rhine,\r\nfire-raisings, duels, battles, skirmishes, ambuscades, treachery,\r\nchivalry--in fact, what you will comes in. And you must be a very\r\nill-conditioned or feeble-minded person if you _don't_ will. Every now\r\nand then one might, no doubt, \"smoke\" a little reminiscence; more\r\nfrequently slight improbabilities; everywhere, of course, an absence of\r\nany fine character-drawing. But these things are the usual spots, and\r\nvery pardonable ones, of the particular sun. I do not remember any\r\nFrench book of the type, outside the Alexandrian realm, that is as good\r\nas _Belle-Rose_;[306] and I am bound to say that it strikes me as better\r\nthan anything of its kind with us, from James and Ainsworth to the\r\nexcellent lady[307] who wrote _Whitehall_, and _Whitefriars_, and _Owen\r\nTudor_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Souvestre, Féval, etc.]\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be evident that of this way in making books, and of\r\nspeaking of them, there is no end.[308] Fain would I dwell a little on\r\nÉmile Souvestre, in whom the \"moral heresy,\" of which he was supposed to\r\nbe a sectary, certainly did not corrupt the pure milk of the\r\ntale-telling gift in such charming things as _Les Derniers Bretons_, _Le\r\nFoyer Breton_, and the rather different _Un Philosophe sous les Toits_;\r\nalso on the better work of Paul Féval, who as certainly did not\r\ninvariably do suit and service to morality, but Sue'd and Soulié'd it in\r\nmany books with promising titles;[309] and who, once at least, was\r\ninspired (again by the witchery of the country between the Baie des\r\nTrépassés and the Rock of Dol) to write _La Fée des Grèves_, a most\r\nagreeable thing of its kind. Auguste Maquet (or Augustus MacKeat) will\r\ncome better in the next chapter, for reasons obvious to some readers no\r\ndoubt already, but to be made so to others there. And so--for this\r\ndivision or subdivision--an end, with one word more on Pétrus Borel's\r\n_Champavert_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Borel's _Champavert_.]\r\n\r\nBorel, whose real Christian name, it is almost unnecessary to say, was\r\nPierre, and who was a sort of incarnation of a \"Jeune-France\" (beginning\r\nas a _bousingot_--not ill translated by the contemporary English\r\n\"bang-up\" for an extreme variety of the kind--and ending as a\r\n_sous-préfet_), wrote other things, including a longer and rather\r\ntedious novel, _Madame Putiphar_. But the tales of _Champavert_,[310]\r\nwhich had the doubly-\"speaking\" sub-title of _Contes Immoraux_, are\r\ncapital examples of the more literary kind of \"rotting.\" They are\r\nadmirably written; they show considerable power. But though one would\r\nnot be much surprised at reading any day in the newspaper a case in\r\nwhich a boatman, plying for hire, had taken a beautiful girl for \"fare,\"\r\nviolated her on the way, and thrown her into the river, the subject is\r\nnot one for art.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[262] It will be observed that I use the words referred to in this note\r\nwith more discrimination than is always the case with some excellent\r\nfolk. I sympathise with Cadoudal most of the three, but I quite\r\nrecognise that Bonaparte had a kind of right to try, and to execute him.\r\nSo, if Pichegru had been tried, he might have been executed. The Enghien\r\nbusiness was pure murder. In some more recent instances these\r\ndistinctions have not, I think, been correctly observed by public\r\nspeakers and writers.\r\n\r\n[263] This _philosophe inconnu_ (as his ticket-name goes in French) is,\r\nI fancy, even more unknown in England. I have not read much of him; but\r\nI think, if it had come in my way, I should have read more.\r\n\r\n[264] Without doing this, it my be suggested that the contrast elsewhere\r\nquoted \"Mérimée était gentilhomme; Sainte-Beuve ne l'était pas,\" was\r\nlikely to make its unfavourable side specially felt in this connection.\r\nHe seems to have disgusted even the Princess Mathilde, one of the\r\nstaunchest of friends and certainly not the most squeamish or prudish of\r\nwomen. Nor, in another matter, can I approve his favourite mixture of\r\nrum and curaçao as a liqueur. I gave it a patient trial once, thinking\r\nit might be critically inspiring. But the rum muddles the curaçao, and\r\nthe curaçao does not really improve the rum. It is a pity he did not\r\nknow the excellent Cape liqueur called Vanderhum, which is not a mixture\r\nbut a true hybrid of the two.\r\n\r\n[265] In articles written for the _Fortnightly Review_ during a large\r\npart of the year 1878, and reprinted in the volume of _Essays on French\r\nNovelists_ frequently referred to.\r\n\r\n[266] _Vide_ the wonderful poem--one of Mr. Anon's pearls, but Donne's\r\nfor more than a ducat--\"Thou sent'st to me a heart was crowned,\" etc.\r\nHowever, the bitter remark quoted elsewhere (_v. inf._) looks like a\r\nlasting wound.\r\n\r\n[267] I can conceive a modernist rising up and saying, \"And your mawkish\r\nante-nuptial wooings? Haven't _we_ had enough of _them_?\" To which I\r\nshould reply, \"Impossible.\" The sages of old have rightly said that 'The\r\nway of a man with a maid' is a mystery always, and the proofs thereof\r\nare well seen in literature as in life. But the way of an extra-man with\r\nanother person's wife can, as illustrated, if not demonstrated, by the\r\nmyriads of treatises thereon in French and the thousands of imitations\r\nin other languages (reinforced, if not the Stoic scavenger-researcher so\r\npleases, by the annals of the Divorce Court and its predecessors), be\r\nalmost scientifically reduced to two classes. (1) Is the lady\r\n_adulteraturient_? In that case results can be attained anyhow. (2) Is\r\nshe not? In that case results can be attained nohow. Which considerably\r\nminishes the interest of this situation. The interest of the other is\r\nthe interest of \"the world's going round\" in quality, and almost\r\ninfinitely various in detail. But when something has once happened the\r\nvariety ceases, or is immensely reduced.\r\n\r\n[268] \"_Bien! mon sang._\" I suppose \"democratic\" sentiment is quite\r\ninsensible to this, which seems to be a pity.\r\n\r\n[269] I think it should be added to Sandeau's credit that (as it appears\r\nto me at least) he had a strong influence on the reaction against\r\nNaturalism at the end of the century.\r\n\r\n[270] Most of his contemporaries would have envied him this admirably\r\n_moyen-âge_ and sonorous designation. But it is certainly cumbrous for a\r\ntitle-page, and its owner--a modest man with a sense of humour--may\r\nperhaps have thought that it _might_ be rather more ridiculous than\r\nsublime there.\r\n\r\n[271] As is usual and natural with men of his time, La Vendée mostly\r\nsupplies it; but that glorious failure did not inspire him quite so well\r\nas it did Sandeau or even (_v. inf._) Édouard Ourliac. However, he was a\r\nsound Royalist, for which peace be to his soul!\r\n\r\n[272] Who, by the way, was a good friend and a good appreciator of\r\nBernard.\r\n\r\n[273] For any one who cares for the minor \"arts and crafts\" of\r\nliterature this is _the_ example of Adaptation itself. The story is not\r\ntranslated; it is not imitated; it is not parodied. It is simply\r\n_transfused_ from one body of a national literature into another, and I\r\ndefy the acutest and most experienced critic to find in the English, if\r\nhe did not previously know the facts, any trace of a French original.\r\n\r\n[274] Corinne made a great blunder: but admirers of Miss Austen have\r\nsometimes taken it as being greater than it was. \"Vulgaire\" and \"vulgar\"\r\nare by no means exact synonyms: in fact the French word is probably used\r\nmuch oftener in a more or less inoffensive sense than otherwise.\r\n\r\n[275] Especially in the next chapter but one.\r\n\r\n[276] Or was it Comte that was \"naught\" and Fourier that was \"void\"? I\r\nam sure the third person, namely, Cabet, was \"puerile\"; but I do not\r\nthink I could read _Aurora Leigh_ again, even to make sure of the\r\ndistribution of the other epithets.\r\n\r\n[277] The real _old_ Constantia has, I believe, ceased to exist. It was\r\na delicious _vin de liqueur_, but you might as well ice Madeira or a\r\nbrown sherry.\r\n\r\n[278] Thackeray pays Sue the very high compliment of having \"tried\r\nalmost always [to attain], and in _Mathilde_ very nearly succeeded in\r\nattaining, a tone of _bonne compagnie_,\" I found the particular book\r\ndifficult to get hold of. Apropos of French naval novels, will somebody\r\ntell me who wrote _Le Roi des Gabiers_, an immense _feuilleton_-romance,\r\nwhich I remember reading a vast number of years ago? I think he had (or\r\ntook) a Breton name, and wrote others. But the navy, even with Jean Bart\r\nand Surcouf and the Bailli, has never attracted any of the _great_\r\nFrench novelists.\r\n\r\n[279] I ought perhaps to say that the second volume does not seem to me\r\nto be quite equal to the first. The \"sixteen years allowed for\r\nrefreshment\" do not justify themselves.\r\n\r\n[280] In _La Lionne_ (which is not to be confused with _Le Lion\r\nAmoureux_, a \"psychological\" diploma-piece praised by some) there are\r\nchapters and chapters of love-making \"of a sort.\" But it is not the\r\nright sort.\r\n\r\n[281] The famous or legendary chamber at Glamis--and perhaps another not\r\nso generally known story of a mansion farther north still, where you see\r\nfrom the courtyard a window the room belonging to which cannot be found\r\nfrom the inside--will occur. But Soulié, though he might have heard of\r\nthe former, is very unlikely to have known the latter, which comes\r\nnearer to his arrangement.\r\n\r\n[282] The contact _here_ with the _Peau de Chagrin_ need hardly be dwelt\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n[283] A little more on this subject may be given later to Gaboriau and\r\nPonson du Terrail.\r\n\r\n[284] Reprinted in _Essays on French Novelists_.\r\n\r\n[285] A somewhat fuller discussion of this heretical _bona patria_ of\r\nliterature may be found in the original Essay. I had at one time thought\r\nof reprinting it--in text or appendix--here. But perhaps it would be\r\nsuperfluous. I ought, however, to add that I have seen, in French\r\nwriters, later again than those referred to in the text, some touches of\r\nrevived interest in Murger.\r\n\r\n[286] Translated at length in the Essay.\r\n\r\n[287] I have always been a little curious to know whether that\r\nremarkable periodical, Cope's _Tobacco Plant_, which gave us not a\r\nlittle of James Thomson the Second's work, was really, as it might have\r\nbeen, conceived as a follower of _Le Castor_.\r\n\r\n[288] Murger knows this and allows it.\r\n\r\n[289] Who, moreover, _did_ work, and that pretty hard, in his\r\nSecretaryship, and by no means disdained pay for it--purely \"patriotic\"\r\nas (in his view) it was.\r\n\r\n[290] _Jérôme Paturot, with Considerations on Novels in General_,\r\noriginally appeared in _Fraser_ for September 1843. Not reprinted in the\r\nauthor's lifetime, or till the supplementary collection of 1885-86. May\r\nbe found, with some remarks by the present writer, in the \"Oxford\"\r\nThackeray, vol. vi. pp. 318-342.\r\n\r\n[291] It is fair to say that some of the best Alexandriana were still to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n[292] The retort courteous, if not even the countercheck quarrelsome,\r\n\"Then why do you notice it?\" is pretty obvious. Taking it as the former,\r\nit may be answered, \"The political novel, if not the most strictly\r\nlegitimate species of the kind, is numerous and not unimportant. It may\r\ntherefore be allowed a specimen, and an examination of that specimen.\"\r\n\r\n[293] Malvina, as one might expect, is by this time an \"Anti-\" of the\r\nmost stalwart kind; though in the Saint-Simonian salad days, she had (as\r\nnaturally) taken the other side.\r\n\r\n[294] Probably more people know _La Croix de Berny_, which he wrote with\r\nSandeau, Gautier, and Madame de Girardin, than anything exclusively his.\r\n\r\n[295] Others may have been more fortunate. In any case, what follows,\r\nwhatever its intrinsic merit, is typical of a great mass of similar\r\nFrench fiction, and therefore may claim attention here.\r\n\r\n[296] It would be interesting to know where Méry got this hideous,\r\ncacophonous, hopelessly anti-analogical and anti-etymological but alas!\r\nactually existing name. I never heard of a ship called by it, but I once\r\nknew a poor lady on whom it had been inflicted at her baptism. Why any\r\none with Jemima (not, of course, originally a feminine of \"Jem,\" but\r\nadopted as such), which, though a little comic, is not intolerable,\r\nJacqueline and Jaquetta (which are exceedingly pretty), and Jacobina\r\n(which, though with unfortunate historical associations, is not itself\r\nugly) to choose from, should have invented this horrible solecism, I\r\nnever could make out. It is, I believe, confined to Scotland, and the\r\nonly comfort connected with it is the negative one that, in two\r\nconsiderable residences there, I never heard of a \"_Charles_ina.\" I\r\nsuppose \"Caroline\" and \"Charlotte\" sufficed; or perhaps, while Whigs\r\ndisliked the name (at least before that curious purifier of it, Fox),\r\nTories shrank from profanation thereof.\r\n\r\n[297] Was it Mr. Augustus Dunshunner? It was just about the time of the\r\nGlenmutchkin Railway, and most of \"Maga's\" men were Oxonians.\r\n\r\n[298] See in vol. v. of the Oxford edition of Thackeray (for the thing,\r\nthough never acknowledged, is certainly his) an exemplary\r\n\"justification\" of this very impudent offender.\r\n\r\n[299] I have no quarrel with Manchester--quite the reverse--in\r\nconsequence of divers sojourns, longer and shorter, in the place, and of\r\nmuch kindness shown to me by the not at all barbarous people. But\r\nneither the climate nor the general \"conditions\" of the city can be\r\ncalled paradisaical.\r\n\r\n[300] They were as much shocked at it as we were at their \"Houses of\r\nTolerance\" and at the institution of the _grisette_.\r\n\r\n[301] Not the worst perhaps of the myriad attempts to do something of\r\nthe same kind in English was made recently: \"If a man conscientiously\r\nobjects to be shot _for_ his country, he may be conscientiously shot\r\n_by_ it.\"\r\n\r\n[302] Here is one from \"Un Diamant\" (_Contes et Nouvelles_), which,\r\nthough destitute of the charms of poetry, rivals and perhaps indeed\r\nsuggested our own\r\n\r\nAnd even an Eastern Counties' train Comes in at last.\r\n\r\n\"Quelque loin qu'on aille, on finit par arriver; _on arrive bien à\r\nSaint-Maur--trois lieues à faire--en coucou_.\"\r\n\r\n[303] In the same article in which he dealt with Charles de Bernard.\r\n\r\n[304] I know that many people do not agree with me here; but Blake did:\r\n\"Tell me the facts, O historian, and leave me to reason on them as I\r\nplease; away with your reasoning and your rubbish.... Tell me the What:\r\nI do not want you to tell me the Why and the How. I can find that out\r\nfor myself.\"\r\n\r\n[305] If my friend Mr. Henley were alive (and I would he were) I should\r\nhave to \"look out for squalls.\" It was, as ought to be well known, his\r\nidea that _Henri Trois et Sa Cour_ was much more the rallying trumpet of\r\n1830 that _Hernani_, and I believe a large part of his dislike for\r\nThackeray was due to the cruel fun which _The Paris Sketch-book_ makes\r\nof _Kean_. But I speak as I think and find, after long re-thinking and\r\nresearching.\r\n\r\n[306] I have made some further excursions in the work of Achard, but\r\nthey did not incline me to continue them, and I do not propose to say\r\nanything of the results here. I learn from the books that there were\r\nsome other Achards, one of whom \"improved the production of the\r\nbeet-root sugar.\" I would much rather have written _Belle-Rose_.\r\n\r\n[307] Emma Robinson. I used, I think, to prefer her to either of her\r\nmore famous companions in the list. But I have never read her _Caesar\r\nBorgia_. It sounds appetising.\r\n\r\n[308] Some may say, \"There might have been an end much sooner with some\r\nof the foregoing.\" Perhaps so--once more. I do not claim to be _hujus\r\norbis Papa_ and infallible. But I sample to the best of my knowledge and\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n[309] _Beau Démon_, _Coeur d'Acier_, _La Tache Rouge_, etc. Féval began\r\na little later than most of the others in this chapter, but he is of\r\ntheir class.\r\n\r\n[310] Thackeray, when very young and wasting his time and money in\r\nediting the _National Standard_, wrote a short and very savage review of\r\nthis which may be found in the Oxford Edition of his works (vol. i., as\r\narranged by the present writer). It is virtuously indignant (and no\r\nwonder, seeing that the writer takes it quite seriously), but, as\r\nThackeray was almost to the last when in that mood, quite\r\nbull-in-a-china-shoppy. You _might_ take it seriously, and yet\r\ncritically in another way, as a \"degeneracy\" of the Terror-Novel. But\r\nthe \"rotting\" view is better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nDUMAS THE ELDER\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The case of Dumas.]\r\n\r\nWith Dumas[311] _père_ the same difficulties (or nearly the same) of\r\ngeneral and particular nature present themselves as those which occurred\r\nwith Balzac. There is, again, the task--not so arduous and by no means\r\nso hopeless as some may think, but still not of the easiest--of writing\r\npretty fully without repetition on subjects on which you have written\r\nfully already. There is the enormous bulk, far greater than in the other\r\ncase, of the work: which makes any complete survey of its individual\r\ncomponents impossible. And there is the wide if not universal knowledge\r\nof this or that--if not of this _and_ that--part of it; which makes such\r\nsurvey unnecessary and probably unwelcome. But here, as there, in\r\nwhatever contrast of degree and kind, there is the importance in\r\nrelation to the general subject, which needs pretty abundant notice, and\r\nthe particular character of that importance, which demands special\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThere are probably not quite so many readers as there might have been a\r\ngeneration ago who would express indignation at the idea that the two\r\nnovelists can be held in any degree[312] comparable. Between the two\r\nperiods a pretty strong and almost concerted effort was made by persons\r\nof no small literary position, such as Mr. Lang, Mr. Stevenson, and Mr.\r\nHenley, who are dead, and others, some of whom are alive, to follow the\r\nlead of Thackeray many years earlier still. They denounced, supporting\r\nthe denunciation with all the literary skill and vigour of which they\r\nwere capable, the notion, common in France as well as in England, that\r\nDumas was a mere _amuseur_, whether they did or did not extend their\r\nbattery to the other notion (common then in England, if not in France)\r\nthat he was an amuser whose amusements were pernicious. These efforts\r\nwere perhaps not entirely ineffectual: let us hope that actual reading,\r\nby not unintelligent or prejudiced readers, had more effect still.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charge and discharge.]\r\n\r\nBut let us also go back a little and, adding one, repeat what the\r\ncharges against Dumas are. There is the moral charge just mentioned;\r\nthere is the not yet mentioned charge of plagiarism and \"devilling\"; and\r\nthere is the again already mentioned complaint that he is a mere\r\n\"pastimer\"; that he has no literary quality; that he deserves at best to\r\ntake his chance with the novelists from Sue to Gaboriau who have been or\r\nwill be dismissed with rather short shrift elsewhere. Let us, as best\r\nseems to suit history, treat these in order, though with very unequal\r\ndegrees of attention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Morality.]\r\n\r\nThe moral part of the matter needs but a few lines. The objection here\r\nwas one of the still fewer things that did to some extent justify and\r\n\"_sens_ify\" the nonsense and injustice since talked about Victorian\r\ncriticism. In fact this nonsense may (there is always, or nearly\r\nalways, some use to be made even of nonsense) be used against its\r\nearlier brother. It is customary to objurgate Thackeray as too moral.\r\nThackeray never hints the slightest objection on this score against\r\nthese novels, whatever he may do as to the plays. For myself, I do not\r\npretend to have read everything that Dumas published. There may be among\r\nthe crowd something indefensible, though it is rather odd that if there\r\nis, I should not merely never have read it but never have heard of it.\r\nIf, on the other hand, any one brings forward Mrs. Grundy's opinion on\r\nthe Ketty and Milady passages in the _Mousquetaires_; on the story of\r\nthe origin of the Vicomte de Bragelonne; on the way in which the divine\r\nMargot was consoled for her almost tragic abandonment in a few hours by\r\nlover and husband--I must own that as Judge on the present occasion I\r\nshall not call on any counsel of Alexander's to reply. \"Bah! it is\r\nbosh,\" as the greatest of Dumas' admirers remarks of another matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Plagiarism and devilling.]\r\n\r\nThe plagiarism (or rather devilling + plagiarism) article of the\r\nindictment, tedious as it may be, requires a little longer notice. The\r\nfacts, though perhaps never to be completely established, are\r\nsufficiently clear as far as history needs, on the face of them. Dumas'\r\nworks, as published in complete edition, run to rather over three\r\nhundred volumes. (I have counted them often on the end-papers of the\r\nbeloved tomes, and though they have rather a knack, like the windows of\r\nother enchanted houses, of \"coming out\" different, this is near enough.)\r\nExcluding theatre (twenty-five volumes), travels, memoirs, and so-called\r\nhistory, they must run to about two hundred and fifty. Most if not all\r\nof these volumes are of some three hundred pages each, very closely\r\nprinted, even allowing for the abundantly \"spaced\" conversation. I\r\nshould say, without pretending to an accurate \"cast-off,\" that any\r\n_three_ of these volumes would be longer even than the great\r\n\"part\"-published works of Dickens, Thackeray, or Trollope; that any\r\n_two_ would exceed in length our own old average \"three-decker\"; and\r\nthat any _one_ contains at least twice the contents of the average\r\nsix-shilling masterpiece of the present day.\r\n\r\nNow it stands to reason that a man who spent only the later part of his\r\nworking life in novel-production, who travelled a great deal, and who,\r\naccording to his enemies, devoted a great deal of time to relaxation,[313]\r\n is not likely to have written all this enormous bulk himself, even\r\nif it were physically possible for him to have done so. One may go\r\nfarther, and say that pure internal evidence shows that the whole was\r\n_not_ written by the same person.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Collaborators?]\r\n\r\nAs for the actual collaborators--the \"young men,\" as Thackeray\r\nobligingly called them, who carried out the works in a less funereal\r\nsense than that in which the other \"young men\" carried out Ananias and\r\nSapphira--that is a question on which I do not feel called upon to enter\r\nat any length. Anybody who cannot resist curiosity on the point may\r\nconsult Alphonse Karr (who really might have found something fitter on\r\nwhich to expend his energies); Quérard, an ill-tempered bibliographer,\r\nfor whom there is the excuse that, except ill-temper, idleness, with a\r\nparticularly malevolent Satan to find work for its hands to do, or mere\r\nhunger, hardly anything would make a man a bibliographer of his sort;\r\nand the person whom the law called Jacquot, and he himself by the\r\nhandsomer title of Eugène de Mirecourt. Whether Octave Feuillet\r\nexercised himself in this other kind before he took to his true line of\r\nnovels of society; whether that ingenious journalist M. Fiorentino also\r\nplayed a part, are matters which who so lists may investigate. The most\r\ndangerous competitor seems to be Auguste Maquet--the \"Augustus MacKeat\"\r\nof the Romantic dawn--to whom some have even assigned the\r\n_Mousquetaires_[314] bodily, as far as the novel adds to the Courtils de\r\nSandras \"memoirs.\" But even with him, and still more with the others,\r\nthe good old battle-horse, which never fails one in this kind of\r\n_chevauchée_, will be found to be effective in carrying the banner of\r\nAlexander the Greatest safe through. How does it happen that in the\r\nindependent work of none of these, nor of any others, do the _special_\r\nmarks and merits of Dumas appear? How does it happen that these marks\r\nand merits appear constantly and brilliantly in all the best work\r\nassigned to Dumas, and more fitfully in almost all its vast extent?\r\nThere may be a good deal of apple in some plum-jam and perhaps some\r\nvegetable-marrow. But plumminess is plumminess still, and it is the\r\nplumminess of \"Dumasity\" which we are here to talk of, and that\r\nonly--the quality, not the man. And whether Dumas or Diabolus conceived\r\nand brought it about matters, in the view of the present historian, not\r\na _centime_. By \"Dumas\" is here and elsewhere--throughout this chapter\r\nand throughout this book--meant Dumasity, which is something by itself,\r\nand different from all other \"-nesses and -tudes and -ties.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The positive value as fiction and as literature of the books:\r\nthe less worthy works.]\r\n\r\nWe can therefore, if we choose, betake ourselves with a joyful and quiet\r\nmind to the real things--the actual characteristics of that Dumasity,\r\nDiabolicity, or _Dieu-sait-quoi_, which distinguishes (in measures and\r\ndegrees varying, perhaps essentially, certainly according to the\r\ndiffering castes of readers) the great Mousquetaire trilogy; the hardly\r\nless great collection of _La Reine Margot_ and its continuations; the\r\nlong eighteenth-century set which, in a general way, may be said to be\r\ntwo-centred, having now Richelieu (the Duke, not the Cardinal) and now\r\nCagliostro for pivot; and _Monte Cristo_--with power to add to their\r\nnumber. In what will be said, attention will chiefly be paid to the\r\nbooks just mentioned, and perhaps a few more, such as _La_ _Tulipe\r\nNoire_; nor is even this list so closed that anybody may not consider\r\nany special favourites of his own admissible as subjects for the almost\r\nwholly unmitigated appreciation which will follow. I do not think that\r\nDumas was ever at his best before the late sixteenth century or after\r\nthe not quite latest eighteenth. _Isabel de Bavière_ and the _Bâtard de\r\nMauléon_, with others, are indeed more readable than most minor\r\nhistorical novels; but their wheels drive somewhat heavily. As for the\r\nrevolutionary set, after the _Cagliostro_ interest is disposed of, some\r\npeople, I believe, rate _Le Chevalier de Maison Rouge_ higher than I do.\r\nIt is certainly better than _Les Blancs et les Bleus_ or _Les Louves de\r\nMachecoul_, in the latter of which Dumas has calmly \"lifted\" (or allowed\r\na lazy \"young man\" to lift) the whole adventure of Rob Roy at the Fords\r\nof Frew, pretty nearly if not quite _verbatim_.[315] Of more avowed\r\ntranslations such as _Ivanhoe_ and _Jacques Ortis_ (the latter about as\r\nmuch out of his way as anything could be), it were obviously superfluous\r\nto take detailed notice. In others the very titles, such as, for\r\ninstance, _Les Mohicans de Paris_, show at once that he is merely\r\nimitating popular styles. Yet others, such as _Madame de Chamblay_[316]\r\n(in which I cannot help thinking that the \"young man\" was Octave\r\nFeuillet not yet come to his prime), have something of the ordinary\r\nnineteenth-century novel--not of the best kind.\r\n\r\nBut in all these and many more it is simply a case of \"Not here!\" though\r\nin the historical examples, before Saint Bartholomew and after\r\nSainte-Guillotine, the sentence may be mitigated to \"Not here\r\n_consummately_.\" And it may be just, though only just, necessary to say\r\nthat this examination of Dumas' qualities should itself, with very\r\nlittle application or moral, settle the question whether he is a mere\r\ncirculating-library caterer or a producer of real literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The worthier--treatment of them not so much individually as\r\nunder heads.]\r\n\r\nTo give brief specifications of books and passages in the novels\r\nmentioned above, in groups or individually, may seem open to the\r\nobjections often made to a mere catalogue of likes and dislikes. But,\r\nafter all, in the estimation of aesthetic matters, it _is_ likes and\r\ndislikes that count. Nowhere, and perhaps in this case less than\r\nanywhere else, can the critic or the historian pretend to dispense his\r\nreaders from actual perusal; it is sufficient, but it is at the same\r\ntime necessary, that he should prepare those who have not read and\r\nremind those who have. For champion specimen-pieces, satisfying, not\r\nmerely in parts but as wholes, the claim that Dumas shall be regarded as\r\nan absolute master in his own craft and in his own particular division\r\nof it, the present writer must still select, after fifty years' reading\r\nand re-reading, _Vingt Ans Après_ and _La Reine Margot_. Parts of _Les\r\nTrois Mousquetaires_ are unsurpassed and unsurpassable; but the\r\nBonacieux love-affair is inadequate and intruded, and I have never\r\nthought Milady's seduction of Felton quite \"brought off.\" In _Le Vicomte\r\nde Bragelonne_ this inequality becomes much more manifest. Nothing,\r\nagain, can surpass the single-handed achievement of D'Artagnan at the\r\nbeginning in his kidnapping of General Monk, and few things his failure\r\nat the end to save Porthos, with the death of the latter--a thing which\r\nhas hardly a superior throughout the whole range of the novel in\r\nwhatever language (so far as I know) it has been written. But the \"young\r\nmen\" were allowed their heads, by far too frequently and for too long\r\nperiods, in the middle;[317] and these heads were by no means always\r\nequal to the occasion. There is no such declension in the immediate\r\nfollowers of _La Reine Margot_, _La Dame de Monsoreau_, and _Les\r\nQuarante-Cinq_. Chicot is supreme, but the personal interest is less\r\ndistributed than in the first book and in the _Mousquetaire_ trilogy.\r\n\r\nThis lack of distribution, and the inequalities of the actual\r\nadventures, are, naturally enough, more noticeable still in the longer\r\nand later series dealing with the eighteenth century, while, almost of\r\nnecessity, the purely \"romantic\" interest is at a lower strength. I can,\r\nhowever, find very little fault with _Le Chevalier d'Harmental_--an\r\nexcellent blend of lightness and excitement. _Olympe de Clèves_ has had\r\nvery important partisans;[318] but though I like Olympe herself almost\r\nbetter than any other of Dumas' heroines, except Marguerite, she does\r\nnot seem to me altogether well \"backed up\"; and there is here, as there\r\nhad been in the _Vicomte de Bragelonne_, and was to be in others, too\r\nmuch insignificant court-intrigue. The Cagliostro cycle again appeals\r\nvery strongly to some good critics, and I own that in reading it a\r\nsecond time I liked it better than I had done before. But I doubt\r\nwhether the supernatural of any kind was a circle in which Dumas could\r\nwalk with perfect freedom and complete command of his own magic. There\r\nremains, as among the novels selected as pieces, not of conviction, but\r\nof diploma, _Monte Cristo_, perhaps the most popular of all, certainly\r\none of the most famous, and still holding its popularity with good wits.\r\nHere, again. I have to confess a certain \"correction of impression.\" As\r\nto the _Château d'If_, which is practically an independent book, there\r\ncan hardly be two opinions among competent and unprejudiced persons. But\r\nI used to find the rest--the voluminous rest--rather heavy reading.\r\nRecently I got on better with them; but I can hardly say that they even\r\nnow stand, with me, that supreme test of a novel, \"Do you want to read\r\nit again?\" I once, as an experiment, read \"Wandering Willie's Tale\"\r\nthrough, every night for a week, having read it I don't know how many\r\ntimes before; and I found it no more staled at the seventh enjoyment\r\nthan I should have found the charm of Helen or of Cleopatra herself. I\r\ndo not know how many times I have read Scott's longer novels (with one\r\nor two exceptions), or Dickens', or Thackeray's, or not a few others in\r\nFrench and English, including Dumas himself. And I hope to read them all\r\nonce, twice, or as many times more as those other Times which are in\r\nSome One's hand will let me. But I do not want to read _Monte Cristo_\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIt will be clear from these remarks that, whether rightly or wrongly, I\r\nthink Dumas happiest in his dealings with historical or quasi-historical\r\nmatters, these dealings being subject to the general law, given more\r\nthan once elsewhere, that the historical personages shall not, in their\r\nhistorically registered and detailed character, occupy the chief\r\npositions in the story. In other words, he seems to me to have preferred\r\nan historical canvas and a few prominent figures outlined thereon--in\r\nwhich respect he does not greatly differ from other historical novelists\r\nso far as they are historical novelists merely. But Dumas, as a novelist\r\nof French history, had at his disposal sources and resources, for\r\nfilling up his pictures, which were lacking elsewhere, and which, in\r\nparticular, English novelists possessed hardly at all, as regards\r\nanything earlier than the eighteenth century. I dare say it has often\r\noccurred to other people, as it has to me, how vastly different _Peveril\r\nof the Peak_--one of the least satisfactory of Scott's novels--would\r\nhave been if Pepys's Diary had been published twenty years earlier\r\ninstead of two years later. Evelyn was available, but far less suitable\r\nto the purpose, and was only published when Scott had begun to write\r\nrather than to read.[319] For almost every year, certainly for every\r\ndecade and every notable person's life with which and with whom he\r\nwished to deal, Dumas had \"Memoirs\" on to which, if he did not care to\r\ntake the trouble himself, he had only to turn one of the \"young men\" to\r\nget facts, touches, ornaments, suggestions enough for twenty times his\r\nown huge production. Of course other people had these same stores open\r\nto them, and that other people did not make the same use thereof[320] is\r\none of the chief glories of Alexander the Great in fiction. But in any\r\nreal critical-historical estimate of him, the fact has to take its\r\nplace, and its very great place.\r\n\r\nBut there is the other fact, or collection of facts, of greater\r\nimportance still, implied in the question, \"What did he do with these\r\nstores?\" and \"How did he, as it seems to Alexandrians at least, do so\r\nmuch better than those other people, to whom they were open quite as\r\nfreely?\"\r\n\r\nIt is, however, before answering these questions at large, perhaps once\r\nmore necessary to touch on what may be called the historical-_accuracy_\r\nobjection. If anybody says, \"The man represents Charles I. as having\r\nbeen taken, after he had been sold by the Scotch, direct from Newcastle\r\nto London, tried at once, and executed in a day or two. This was not the\r\nway things happened\"--you are bound to acknowledge his profound and\r\nrecondite historical learning. But if he goes on to say that he cannot\r\nenjoy _Vingt Ans Après_ as a novel because of this, you are equally\r\nbound to pity his still more profound aesthetic ignorance and impotence.\r\nThe facts, in regard to the criticism of historical novels as such,\r\nillustrate the wisdom of Scott in keeping his historical characters for\r\nthe most part in the background, and the _un_wisdom of Vigny in\r\npreferring the opposite course. But they do nothing more. If Dumas had\r\nchosen, he might have separated the dramatic meeting of the Four at\r\nNewcastle itself--and the intenser tale of their effort to save Charles,\r\nwith its sequel of their own narrow escape from the _Éclair_ felucca--by\r\nchapters, or a book, of adventures in France. But he did not choose; and\r\nthe liberty of juxtaposition which he took is more apparently than\r\nreally different from that which Shakespeare takes, when he jumps ten\r\nyears in _Antony and Cleopatra_. What Dumas _really_ borrows from\r\nhistory--the tragic interest of the King's fate--is in each case\r\nhistorically true, though it is eked and adapted and manipulated to suit\r\nthe fictitious interest of the Quadrilateral. You certainly could not,\r\nthen or now, _ride_ from Windsor to London in twenty minutes, though you\r\ncould now motor the distance in the time, at the risk of considerable\r\nfines. And an Englishman, jealous of his country's honour, might urge\r\nthat, while the \"Vin _de Porto_\" itself came in rather later, there were\r\nfew places in the England of the seventeenth century where that \"Vin\r\n_d'Espagne_,\" so dear to Athos, was not more common than it was in\r\nFrance, though one would not venture to deny that the shortly-to-become\r\nBaron de Bracieux _had_ some genuine Xérès (as we are told) in his\r\ncellar. But these things are--no more and no less than the greater\r\nones--utter trifles as far as the actual novel interest is concerned.\r\nThey are, indeed, less than trifles: they can hardly be said to exist.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His attitude to Plot.]\r\n\r\nThe \"four wheels of the novel\" have been sometimes, and perhaps rightly,\r\nsaid to be Plot, Character, Description, and Dialogue--Style[321] being\r\na sort of fifth. Of the first there is some difficulty in speaking,\r\nbecause the word \"plot\" is by no means used, as the text-books say,\r\n\"univocally,\" and its synonyms or quasi-synonyms, in the different\r\nusages, are themselves things \"kittle\" to deal with. \"Action\" is\r\nsometimes taken as one of these synonyms--certainly in some senses of\r\naction no novelist has ever had more; very few have had so much. But of\r\nconcerted, planned, or strictly co-ordinated action, of more than\r\nepisode character, he can hardly be said to have been anything like a\r\nmaster. His best novels are chronicle-plays undramatised--large numbers\r\nof his scenes could be cut out with as little real loss as foolish\r\n\"classical\" critics used to think to be the case with Shakespeare; and\r\nhis connections, when he takes the trouble to make any, are often his\r\nvery weakest points. Take, for instance, the things that bring about\r\nD'Artagnan's great quest for the diamonds--one of the most excellent\r\nepisodes in this department of fiction, and something more than an\r\nepisode in itself. The author actually cannot think of any better way\r\nthan to make Constance Bonacieux--who is represented as a rather\r\nunusually intelligent woman, well acquainted with her husband's\r\ncharacter, and certainly not likely to overestimate him through any\r\nsuperabundance of wifely affection or admiration--propose that he, a\r\nmiddle-aged mercer of sedentary and _bourgeois_ habits, shall undertake\r\nan expedition which, on the face of it, requires youth, strength,\r\naudacity, presence of mind, and other exceptional qualities in no\r\nordinary measure, and which, if betrayed to an ever vigilant, extremely\r\npowerful, and quite unscrupulous enemy, is almost certain to be\r\nfrustrated.\r\n\r\nStill the \"chronicle\"-action dispenses a man, to a large extent, in the\r\neyes of some readers at any rate, from even attempting exact and tight\r\n_liaisons_ of scene in this fashion, though of course if he does attempt\r\nthem he submits himself to the perils of his attempt just as his heroes\r\nsubmit themselves to theirs. But other readers--and perhaps all those\r\npredestined to be Alexandrians--do not care to exact the penalties for\r\nsuch a failure. They are quite content to find themselves launched on\r\nthe next reach of the stream, without asking too narrowly whether they\r\nhave been ushered decorously through a lock or have tumbled somehow over\r\na lasher. Such troubles never drown or damage _them_. And indeed there\r\nare some of them sufficiently depraved by nature, and hardened by\r\nindulgence in sin, to disregard _general_ action altogether, and to look\r\nmainly if not wholly to the way in which the individual stories are\r\ntold, not at that in which they come to have to be told. Of Dumas' power\r\nof telling a story there surely can be no two opinions. The very\r\nreproach of _amuseur_ confesses it. Of the means--or some of them--by\r\nwhich he does and does not exercise this power, more may be said under\r\nthe heads which follow. We are here chiefly concerned with the power as\r\nit has been achieved and stands--in, for instance, such a thing, already\r\nglanced at, as the \"Vin de Porto\" episode or division of _Vingt Ans\r\nAprès_, which, though there are scores of others nearly as good, seems\r\nto me on the whole the very finest thing Dumas ever did in his own\r\npeculiar kind. There are just two dozen pages of it--pages very well\r\nfilled--from the moment when Blaisois and Mousqueton express their ideas\r\non the subject of the unsuitableness of beer, as a fortifier against\r\nsea-sickness, to that when the corpse of Mordaunt, after floating in the\r\nmoonlight with the gold-hilted dagger flashing from its breast, sinks\r\nfor the last time. The interest grows constantly; it is never, as it\r\nsometimes is elsewhere, watered out by too much talk, though there is\r\nenough of this to carry out the author's usual system (_v. inf._).\r\nNothing happens sufficiently extravagant or improbable to excite disgust\r\nor laughter, though what does happen is sufficiently \"palpitating.\" If\r\nthis is melodrama, it is melodrama free from most of the objections made\r\nelsewhere to the kind. And also if it is melodrama, it seems to me to be\r\nmelodrama infinitely superior, not merely in degree, but in kind, to\r\nthat of Sue and Soulié.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To Character.]\r\n\r\nIt is in this \"enfisting\" power of narrative, constantly renewed if not\r\nalways logically sustained and connected, that Dumas' excellence, if not\r\nhis actual supremacy, lies; and the fact may dispense us from saying any\r\nmore about his plots. As to Character, we must still keep the\r\noffensive-defensive line. Dumas' most formidable enemies--persons like\r\nthe late M. Brunetière--would probably say that he has no character at\r\nall. Some of his champions would content themselves with ejaculating\r\nthe two names \"D'Artagnan!\" and \"Chicot!\" shrugging their shoulders, and\r\nabstaining from further argument as likely to be useless, there being no\r\ncommon ground to argue upon. In actual life this might not be the most\r\nirrational manner of proceeding; but it could hardly suffice here. As is\r\nusually, if not invariably, the case, the difference of estimate _is_\r\ntraceable, in the long run, to the fact that the disputants or\r\nadversaries are not using words in the same sense--working in\r\nconjunction with the other fact that they do not like and want the same\r\nthings. Almost all words are ambiguous, owing to the length of time\r\nduring which they have been used and the variety of parts they have been\r\nmade to play. But there are probably few which--without being absolutely\r\nequivocal like \"box\" and our other \"foreigners' horrors\"--require the\r\nuse of the _distinguo_ more than \"character.\" As applied to novels, it\r\nmay mean (1) a human personality more or less deeply analysed; (2) one\r\nvividly distinguished from others; (3) one which is made essentially\r\n_alive_ and almost recognised as a real person; (4) a \"personage\"\r\nticketed with some marks of distinction and furnished with a dramatic\r\n\"part\"; (5) an eccentric. The fourth and fifth may be neglected here. It\r\nis in relation to the other three that we have to consider Dumas as a\r\ncharacter-monger.\r\n\r\nIn the competition for representation of character which depends upon\r\nanalysis, \"psychology,\" \"problem-projection,\" Dumas is of course\r\nnowhere, though, to the disgust of some and the amusement of others,\r\n_Jacques Ortis_ figures in the list of his works. _René_, _Adolphe_, the\r\nworks of Madame de Staël (if they are to be admitted) and those of Beyle\r\n(which no doubt must be) found nothing corresponding in his nature; and\r\nthere was not the slightest reason why they should. The cellar of the\r\nnovel contains even more than the \"thousand dozen of wine\" enshrined by\r\nthat of Crotchet Castle, but no intelligent possessor of it, any more\r\nthan Mr. Crotchet himself, would dream of restricting it to one kind of\r\nvintage. Nor, probably, would any really intelligent possessor arrange\r\nhis largest bins for this kind, which at its best is a very exquisite\r\n_vin de liqueur_, but which few people wish to drink constantly; and\r\nwhich at its worst, or even in mediocre condition, is very poor\r\ntipple--\"shilpit,\" as Peter Peebles most unjustly characterises sherry\r\nin _Redgauntlet_. Skipping (2) for the moment, I do not know that under\r\nhead (3) one can make much fight for Alexander. D'Artagnan and Chicot\r\nare doubtless great, and many others fall not far short of them. I am\r\nalways glad to meet these two in literature, and should be glad to meet\r\nthem in real life, particularly if they were on my side, though their\r\nbeing on the other would add considerably to the excitement of one's\r\nexistence--so long as it continued. But I am not sure that I _know_ them\r\nas I know Marianne and Des Grieux, Tom Jones and My Uncle Toby, the\r\nBaron of Bradwardine and Elizabeth Bennet. Athos I know or should know\r\nif I met him, which I am sorry to say I have not yet done; and La Reine\r\nMargot, and possibly Olympe de Clèves; but there is more guess-work\r\nabout the knowledge with her than in the other cases. Porthos (or\r\nsomebody very like him) I did know, and he was most agreeable; but he\r\ndied too soon to go into the army, as he ought to have done, after\r\nleaving Oxford. And though I never met a complete Aramis, I think I have\r\nmet him in parts. There are not many more of this class. On the other\r\nhand, there is almost an entire absence in Dumas of those mere\r\nlay-figures which are so common in other novelists. There is great\r\nplenty of something more than toy-theatre characters cut out well and\r\nbrightly painted, fit to push across the stage and justify their \"words\"\r\nand vanish; but that is a different thing.\r\n\r\nAnd this leads us partly back and partly up to the second head, the\r\nprovision of characters sufficiently distinguished from others, and so\r\ncapable of playing their parts effectually and interestingly. It is in\r\nthis that he is so good, and it is this which distinguishes himself from\r\nall his fellows but the very greatest. D'Artagnan and Chicot are again\r\nthe best; but how good, at least in the better books, are almost all the\r\nothers! D'Artagnan would be a frightful loss, but suppose he were not\r\nthere and you knew nothing about him, would you not think Planchet\r\nsomething of a prize? Without Chicot there would be a blank horrible to\r\nthink of. But do we not still \"share\"? Have we not Dom Gorenflot?\r\n\r\nIt is in this provision of vivid and sufficiently, if not absolutely,\r\nvivified characters and personages--\"company\" for his narrative\r\ndramas--that Dumas is so admirable under this particular head. If they\r\nare rarely detachable or independent, they work out the business\r\nconsummately. Lackeys and ladies' maids, inn-keepers and casual guests\r\nat inns, courtiers and lawyers, noblemen and \"lower classes,\" they all\r\ndo what they ought to do; they all \"answer the ends of their being\r\ncreated,\"--which is to carry out and on, through two or three or half a\r\ndozen volumes, a blissful suspension from the base realities of\r\nexistence. And if anybody asks of them more than this, it is his own\r\nfault, and a very great fault too.[322]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To Description (and \"style\").]\r\n\r\nOf Description, as of the \"fifth wheel\" style, there is little to say\r\nabout Dumas, though the littleness is in neither respect damaging. They\r\nare both adequate to the situation and the composition. Can you say much\r\nmore of him or of anybody? If it were worth while to go into detail at\r\nall, this adequacy could be made out, I think, a good deal more than\r\nsufficiently. Take one of his greatest things, the \"Bastion\r\nSaint-Gervais\" in the _Mousquetaires_. If he has not made you see the\r\nheroic hopeless town, and the French leaguer and the shattered redoubt\r\nbetween, and the forlorn hope of the Four foolhardy yet forethoughtful\r\nand for ever delightful heroes, with their not so cheerful followers,\r\neating, drinking, firing, consulting, and flaunting the immortal\r\nnapkin-pennant in the enemy's face--you would not be made to see it,\r\nthough the authors of _Inès de las Sierras_ or of _Le Château de la\r\nMisère_ had given you a cast of their office. And, what is more, the\r\nmethod of _Inès de las Sierras_ and of _Le Château de la Misère_ would\r\nhave been actually out of place. It would have got in the way of the\r\nbusiness, the engrossing business, of the manual fight against the\r\nRochellois, and the spiritual fight against Richelieu and Rochefort and\r\nMilady. So, again--so almost tautologically--with \"style\" in the more\r\ncomplicated and elaborate sense of the word. One may here once more\r\nthank Émile de Girardin for the phrase that he used of Gautier's own\r\nstyle in _feuilleton_ attempts. It _would_ be _gênant pour\r\nl'abonné_--even for an _abonné_ who was not the first comer. It is not\r\nthe beautiful phrase, over which you can linger, that is required, but\r\nthe straightforward competent word-vehicle that carries you on through\r\nthe business, that you want in such work. The essence of Dumas' quality\r\nis to find or make his readers thirsty, and to supply their thirst. You\r\ncan't quench thirst with _liqueurs_; if you are not a Philistine you\r\nwill not quench it with vintage port or claret, with Château Yquem, or\r\neven with fifteen-year-old Clicquot. A \"long\" whisky and potash, a\r\nbottle of sound Medoc, or, best of all, a pewter quart of not too small\r\nor too strong beer--these are the modest but sufficient quenchers that\r\nsuit the case. And Dumas gives you just the equivalents of these.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: To Conversation.]\r\n\r\nBut it may seem that, for the last head or two, the defence has been a\r\nlittle \"let down\"--the pass, if not \"sold,\" somewhat weakly held.[323]\r\nNo such half-heartedness shall be chargeable on what is going to be said\r\nunder the last category, which, in a way, allies itself to the first. It\r\nis, to a very large extent, by his marvellous use of conversation that\r\nDumas attains his actual mastery of story-telling; and so this\r\ncharacteristic of his is of double importance and requires a Benjamin's\r\nallowance of treatment. The name just used is indeed specially\r\nappropriate, because Conversation is actually the youngest of the\r\nnovelist's family or staff of work-fellows. We have seen, throughout or\r\nnearly throughout the last volume, how very long it was before its\r\npowers and advantages were properly appreciated; how mere _récit_\r\ndominated fiction; and how, when the personages were allowed to speak,\r\nthey were for the most part furnished only or mainly with\r\nharangues--like those with which the \"unmixed\" historian used to endow\r\nhis characters. That conversation is not merely a grand set-off to a\r\nstory, but that it is an actual means of telling the story itself, seems\r\nto have been unconscionably and almost unintelligibly slow in occurring\r\nto men's minds; though in the actual story-telling of ordinary life by\r\nword of mouth it is, and always must have been, frequent enough.[324] It\r\nis not impossible that the derivation of prose from verse fiction may\r\nhave had something to do with this, for gossippy talk and epic or\r\nromance in verse do not go well together. Nor is it probable that the\r\nold, the respectable, but the too often mischievous disinclination to\r\n\"mix kinds\" may have had its way, telling men that talk was the\r\ndramatist's not the novelist's business. But whatever was the cause,\r\nthere can be no dispute about the fact.\r\n\r\nIt was, it should be hardly necessary to say, Scott who first discovered\r\nthe secret[325] to an effectual extent, though he was not always true to\r\nhis own discovery. And it is not superfluous to note that it was a\r\nspecially valuable and important discovery in regard to the novel of\r\nhistorical adventure. It had, of course, and almost necessarily, forced\r\nitself, in regard to the novel of ordinary life, upon our own great\r\nexplorers in that line earlier. Richardson has it abundantly. But when\r\nyou are borrowing the _subjects_ of the historian, what can be more\r\nnatural than to succumb to the _methods_ of the historian--the long\r\ncontinuous narrative and the intercalated harangue? It must be done\r\nsometimes; there is a danger of its being done too often. Before he had\r\nfound out the true secret, Scott blunted the opening of _Waverley_ with\r\n_récit_; after he had discovered it he relapsed in divers places, of\r\nwhich the opening of _The Monastery_ may suffice for mention here. Dumas\r\nhimself (and it will be at once evident that this is a main danger of\r\n\"turning on your young man\") has done it often--to take once more a\r\nsingle example, there is too much of it in the account of the great\r\n_émeute_, by which Gondy started the Fronde. But it is the facility\r\nwhich he has of dispensing with it--of making the story speak itself,\r\nwith only barely necessary additions of the pointer and reciter at the\r\nside of the stage--which constitutes his power. Instances can hardly be\r\nrequired, for any one who knows him knows them, and every one who goes\r\nto him, not knowing, will find them. Just to touch the _apices_ once\r\nmore, the two scenes following the actual overtures of the\r\n_Mousquetaires_ and of _La Reine Margot_--that where the impossible\r\ntriple duel of D'Artagnan against the Three is turned into triumphant\r\nbattle with the Cardinalists, blood-cementing the friendship of the\r\nFour; and that where Margot, after losing both husband and lover, is\r\nsupplied with a substitute for both; adding the later passage where La\r\nMole is saved from the noose at the door--may suffice.\r\n\r\nOf course this device of conversation, like the other best things--the\r\nbeauty of woman, the strength of wine, the sharpness of steel, and red\r\nink--is \"open to abuse.\"[326] It has been admitted that even the\r\nfervency of the present writer's Alexandrianism cools at the \"wall-game\"\r\nof Montalais and Malicorne. There may be some who are not even prepared\r\nto like it in places where I do. They are like Porthos, in the great\r\ninitial interchange of compliments, and \"would still be _doing_.\" But\r\nsurely they cannot complain of any lack of incident in this latest and\r\nnot least _Alexandreid_?\r\n\r\nIt may seem that the length of this chapter is not proportionate to the\r\nmagnitude of the claims advanced for Dumas. But, as in other cases, I\r\nthink it may not be impertinent to put in a reference to what I have\r\npreviously written elsewhere. Moreover, as, but much more than, in the\r\ncases of Sandeau, Bernard, and Murger, there is an argument, paradoxical\r\nin appearance merely, for the absence of prolixity.\r\n\r\nHis claim to greatness consists, perhaps primarily, in the simplicity,\r\nstraightforwardness, and general human interest of his appeal. He wants\r\nno commentaries, no introductions, no keys, no dismal Transactions of\r\nDumas Societies and the like. Every one that thirsteth may come to his\r\nfountain and drink, without mysteries of initiation, or formalities of\r\nlicence, or concomitant nuisances of superintendence and regulation. In\r\nthe _Camp of Refuge_ of Charles Macfarlane (who has recently, in an odd\r\nway, been recalled to passing knowledge)--a full and gallant private in\r\nthe corps of which Dumas himself was then colonel _vice_ Sir Walter\r\ndeceased--there is a sentence which applies admirably to Dumas himself.\r\nAfter a success over the other half of our ancestors, and during a\r\nsupper on the conquered provant, one of the Anglo-Saxon-half observes,\r\n\"Let us leave off talking, and be jolly.\" Nothing could please me better\r\nthan that some reader should be instigated to leave off my book at this\r\npoint, and take up _Les Trois Mousquetaires_ or _Les Quarante-Cinq_, or\r\nif he prefers it, _Olympe de Clèves_--\"and be jolly\".[327]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[311] The postponement of him, to this last chapter of the first\r\ndivision of the book, was determined on chiefly because his _novels_\r\nwere not begun at all till years after the other greater novelists,\r\nalready dealt with, had made their reputation, while the greatest of\r\nthem--the \"Mousquetaire\" and \"Henri Trois\" cycles--did not appear till\r\nthe very last _lustrum_ of the half-century. But another--it may seem to\r\nsome a childish--consideration had some weight with me. I wished to\r\nrange father and son on either side of the dividing summary; for though\r\nthe elder wrote long after 1850 and the younger some time before it, in\r\nhardly any pair is the opposition of the earlier and later times more\r\nclearly exposed; and the identity of name emphasises the difference of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n[312] In using this phrase I remembered the very neat \"score\" made off\r\nthe great Alexander himself by a French judge, in some case at Rouen\r\nwhere Dumas was a witness. Asked as usual his occupation, he replied\r\nsomewhat grandiloquently: \"Monsieur, si je n'étais pas dans la ville de\r\nCorneille, je dirais 'Auteur dramatique.'\" \"Mais, Monsieur,\" replied the\r\nofficial with the sweetest indulgence, \"il y a des degrés.\" (This story\r\nis told, like most such, with variants; and sometimes, as in the\r\nparticular case was sure to happen, not of Alexander the father, but of\r\nAlexander the son. But I tell it, as I read or heard it, long years\r\nago.)\r\n\r\n[313] You may possibly do as an English novelist of the privileged sex\r\nis said to have done, and write novels while people are calling on you\r\nand you are talking to them (though I should myself consider it bad\r\nmanners, and the novels would certainly bear traces of the exploit). But\r\nyou can hardly do it while, as a famous caricature represents the scene,\r\npersons of that same sex, in various dress or undress, are frolicking\r\nabout your chair and bestowing on you their obliging caresses. Nor are\r\ncorricolos and speronares, though they may be good things to write on in\r\none sense, good in another to write in.\r\n\r\n[314] As far as I know Maquet, his line seems to me to have been drama\r\nrather than fiction.\r\n\r\n[315] I seem to remember somebody (I rather think it was Henley, and it\r\nwas very likely to be) attempting a defence of this. But, except _pour\r\nrire_, such a thing is hopeless.\r\n\r\n[316] I think (but it is a long time since I read the book) that it is\r\nthe heroine of this who, supposed to be a dead, escapes from \"that\r\ngrewsome thing, premature interment\" (as Sandy Mackay justly calls it),\r\nbecause of the remarkable odour of _violettes de Parme_ which her\r\nunspotted flesh evolves from the actual grave.\r\n\r\n[317] I do not mind Montalais, but I object to Malicozne both in himself\r\nand as her lover. Mlle. de la Vallière and the plots against her virtue\r\ngive us \"pious Selinda\" at unconscionable length, and, but that it would\r\nhave annoyed Athos, I rather wish M. le Vicomte de la Bragelonne himself\r\nhad come to an end sooner.\r\n\r\n[318] My friend Mr. Henley, I believe, ranked it very high, and so did a\r\ncommon friend of his and mine, the late universally regretted Mr. George\r\nWyndham. It so happened that, by accident, I never read the book till a\r\nfew years ago; and Mr. Wyndham saw it, fresh from the bookseller's and\r\nuncut (or technically, \"unopened\") in my study. I told him the\r\ncircumstances, and he said, in his enthusiastic way, \"I _do_ envy you!\"\r\n\r\n[319] I do not need to be reminded of the conditions of health that also\r\naffected _Peveril_.\r\n\r\n[320] I need not repeat, but merely refer to, what I have said of\r\n_Cinq-Mars_ and of _Notre-Dame de Paris_.\r\n\r\n[321] On the very day on which I was going over the rough draft of this\r\npassage I saw, in a newspaper of repute, some words which perhaps throw\r\nlight on the objection to Dumas as having no literary merit. In them\r\n\"incident, coherence, humour, and dramatic power\" were all excluded from\r\nthis merit, \"style\" alone remaining. Now I have been almost as often\r\nreproved for attaching too much value to style in others as for\r\nattending too little to it myself. But I certainly could not give it\r\nsuch a right to \"reign alone.\" It will indeed \"do\" almost by itself; but\r\nother things can \"do\" almost without it.\r\n\r\n[322] To be absolutely candid, Dumas himself did sometimes ask more of\r\nthem than they could do; and then he failed. There can, I think, be\r\nlittle doubt that this is the secret of the inadequacy (as at least it\r\nseems to me) of the Felton episode. As a friend (whose thousand merits\r\nstrive to cover his one crime of not admiring Dumas quite enough), not\r\nknowing that I had yet written a line of this chapter, but as it\r\nhappened just as I had reached the present point, wrote to me: \"Think\r\nwhat Sir Walter would have made of Felton!\"\r\n\r\n[323] I could myself be perfectly content to adapt George III. on a\r\ncertain _Apology_, and substitute for all this a simple \"I do not think\r\nDumas needs any defence.\" But where there has been so much obloquy,\r\nthere should, perhaps, be some refutation.\r\n\r\n[324] \"And then he says, says he....\"\r\n\r\n[325] In modern novels, of course. You have some good talk in Homer and\r\nalso in the Sagas, but I am not thinking or speaking of them.\r\n\r\n[326]\r\n\r\n     \"Red ink for ornament and black for use--\r\n     The best of things are open to abuse.\"\r\n\r\n         (_The Good Clerk_ as vouched for by Charles Lamb.)\r\n\r\n[327] Yet, being nothing if not critical, I can hardly agree with those\r\nwho talk of Dumas' \"_wild_ imagination\"! As the great Mr. Wordsworth was\r\nmore often made to mourn by the gratitude of men than by its opposite,\r\nso I, in my humbler sphere, am more cast down sometimes by inapposite\r\npraise than by ignorant blame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH NOVEL IN 1850\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The peculiarity of the moment.]\r\n\r\nIt was not found necessary, in the last volume, to suspend the current\r\nof narrative or survey for the purpose of drawing interim conclusions in\r\nspecial \"Interchapters.\"[328] But the subjects of this present are so\r\nmuch more bulky and varied, in proportion to the space available and the\r\ntime considered; while the fortunes of the novel itself altered so\r\nprodigiously during that time, that something of the kind seemed to be\r\ndesirable, if not absolutely necessary. Moreover, the actual centre of\r\nthe century in France, or rather what may be called its precinct, the\r\npolitical interregnum of 1848-1852, is more than a _mere_ political and\r\nchronological date. To take it as an absolute apex or culmination would\r\nbe absurd; and even to take it as a definite turning-point might be\r\nexcessive. Not a few of the greatest novelists then living and\r\nworking--Hugo, whose most popular and bulkiest work in novel was yet to\r\ncome; George Sand, Mérimée, Gautier--were still to write for the best\r\npart of a quarter of a century, if not more; and the most definite fresh\r\nstart of the second period, the rise of Naturalism, was not to take\r\nplace till a little later. But already Chateaubriand, Beyle, Charles de\r\nBernard, and, above all, Balzac, were dead or soon to die: and it cannot\r\nbe said that any of the survivors developed new characters of work, for\r\neven Hugo's was (_v. sup._) only the earlier \"writ large\" and\r\nmodernised in non-essentials. On the other hand, it was only after this\r\ntime that Dumas _fils_, the earliest of what may be called the new\r\nschool, produced his most remarkable work.\r\n\r\nBut the justification of such an \"Interchapter\" as this practically is\r\ndepends, not on what is to come after, but on what has come before; and\r\nin this respect we shall find little difficulty in vindicating the\r\nposition and arrangement assigned to the remarks which are to follow,\r\nthough some of these may look forward as well as backward.[329]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A political nadir.]\r\n\r\nI should imagine that few Frenchmen--despite the almost infinite and\r\nsometimes very startling variety of selection which the _laudator\r\ntemporis acti_ exhibits--look back upon the reign of Louis Philippe as a\r\ngolden age in any respect but one. Regarding it from the point of view\r\nof general politics, the ridiculous change[330] from \"King of France\" to\r\n\"King of the French\" stamped it at once, finally and hopelessly, as the\r\nworst kind of compromise--as a sort of spiritual imitation of the\r\nmethods of the Triumvirate, where everybody gives up, not exactly his\r\nfather or his uncle or his brother, but his dearest and most respectable\r\nconvictions, together with the historical, logical, and sentimental\r\nsupports of them. The king himself--though certainly no fool, and though\r\nhardly to be called an unmitigated knave--was one of those unfortunate\r\npersons whose merits do not in the least interest and whose defects do\r\nvery strongly disgust. Domestically, the reign was a reign, in the other\r\nsense, of silly minor revolutions, which, till the end, came to nothing,\r\nand then came to something only less absurd than the Russian revolution\r\nof the other day, though fortunately less disastrous;[331] of\r\nbureaucracy of the corrupt and shabby character which seemed to cling\r\nto the whole _régime_; and of remarkable vying between two distinguished\r\nmen of letters, Guizot and Thiers, as to which should do most to confirm\r\nthe saying of the wicked that men of letters had much better have\r\nnothing to do with politics.[332] Abroad (with the exception of the\r\nacquisition of Algeria, which had begun earlier, and which conferred no\r\ngreat honour, though some profit, and a little snatching up of a few\r\nloose trifles such as the Society Islands, which we had, according to\r\nour custom, carelessly or benevolently left to gleaners), French arms,\r\ndespite a great deal of brag and swagger, obtained little glory, while\r\nFrench diplomacy let itself wallow in one of the foulest sloughs in\r\nhistory, the matter of the Spanish marriages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And almost a literary zenith.]\r\n\r\nBut this unsatisfactory state of things was made up--and more than made\r\nup--for posterity if not for contemporaries--by the extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of literature and the arts--especially literature and most\r\nespecially of all the _belles-lettres_. If (which would be rather\r\nimpossible) one were to evaluate the relative excellence of poetry and\r\nof prose fiction in the time itself, a great deal could be said on both\r\nsides. But if one took the larger historic view, it would certainly have\r\nto be admitted that, while the excellence of French poetry was a\r\nmagnificent Renaissance after a long period of something like sterility,\r\nthe excellence of the novel was something more--an achievement of things\r\nnever yet achieved; an acquisition and settlement of territory which had\r\nnever previously been even explored.\r\n\r\nI venture to hope that no great injustice has been done to the previous\r\naccomplishments of France in this department as they were surveyed in\r\nthe last volume. She had been, if not the inventress of Romance, the\r\n[Greek: aidoiê tamiê]--the revered distributress--of it to all nations;\r\nshe had made the short story her own to such an extent that, in almost\r\nall its forms, she had reached and kept mastery of it; and in various\r\nisolated instances she had done very important, if not now universally\r\nacceptable, work in the practice of the \"Heroic.\" With Rabelais, Lesage,\r\nalmost Marivaux, certainly, in his one diploma-piece, Prévost, she had\r\ncontributed persons and things of more or less consummateness to the\r\nnovel-staff and the novel treasury. But she had never quite reached, as\r\nEngland for two full generations had reached before 1800, the consummate\r\nexpression of the--_pure_ novel--the story which, not neglecting\r\nincident, but as a rule confining itself to the incidents of ordinary\r\nlife; advancing character to a position at least equal with plot;\r\npresenting the manners of its own day, but charging them with essence of\r\nhumanity in all days; re-creates, for the delectation of readers, a new\r\nworld of probable, indeed of actual, life through the medium of\r\nliterature. And she had rarely--except in the fairy-tale and a very few\r\nmasterpieces like _Manon Lescaut_ again and _La Nouvelle\r\nHéloïse_[333]--achieved what may be called the Romantic or passionate\r\nnovel; while, except in such very imperfect admixtures of the historic\r\nelement as _La Princesse de Clèves_, she had never attempted, and even\r\nin these had never attained, the historical novel proper.\r\n\r\nNow, in 1850, she had done all this, and more.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The performance of the time in novel.]\r\n\r\nAs has been seen, the doing was, if not solely effected between 1830 and\r\n1848, mainly and almost wholly carried out in the second quarter of the\r\ncentury. In the first, only three persons possessing anything like\r\ngenius--Benjamin Constant, Madame de Staël, and Chateaubriand--had\r\nbusied themselves with the novel, and they were all strongly charged\r\nwith eighteenth-century spirit. Indeed, Constant, as we saw in the last\r\nvolume, though he left pattern and stimulus for the nineteenth and the\r\nfuture generally, really represented the last dying words of that\r\n\"Sensibility\" school which was essentially of the past, though it was\r\nundoubtedly necessary to the future. Likewise in Madame de Staël, and\r\nstill more in Chateaubriand, there was model, stimulus, germ. But they\r\nalso were, on the whole, of the eve rather than of the morrow. I have\r\nindeed sometimes wondered what would have happened if Chateaubriand had\r\ngone on writing novels, and had devoted to fiction the talent which he\r\nwasted on the _mesquin_[334] politics of the France of his later days\r\nand on the interesting but restricted and egotistic _Mémoires\r\nd'Outre-Tombe_. It is no doubt true that, though old men have often\r\nwritten great poetry and excellent serious prose, nobody, so\r\nfar as I remember, has written a great novel after seventy. For\r\n_Quatre-Vingt-Treize_, if it be great, is a romance rather than a novel,\r\nand a romance which had much better have been poetry. But this is an\r\nexcursion into the Forbidden Country of the Might-Have-Been. We are\r\nconcerned with what was.\r\n\r\nThe accomplishment of these twenty or five-and-twenty years is so\r\nextraordinary--when bulk, variety, novelty, and greatness of achievement\r\nare considered together--that there is hardly anything like it\r\nelsewhere. The single work of Balzac would mark and make an epoch; and\r\nthis is wholly the property of the period. And though there is still,\r\nand is likely always to be, controversy as to whether the Balzacian men\r\nand women are exactly men and women of _this_ world, there can, as may\r\nhave been shown, be no rational denial of the fact that they represent\r\n_a_ world--not of pure romance, not of fairy-tale, not of convention or\r\nfashion or coterie, but a world human and synthetically possible in its\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _personnel_.]\r\n\r\nBut while the possession of Balzac alone would have sufficed, by itself,\r\nto give the time front rank among the periods of the novel, it is not in\r\nthe least extravagant to add that if Balzac had been blotted out of its\r\nrecord it could still prove title-deeds enough, and more than enough, to\r\nsuch a place. Fault has here been found--perhaps not a few readers may\r\nthink to an excessive, certainly to a considerable extent--with the\r\nnovel-work of Hugo and with that of George Sand. But the fault-finder\r\nhas not dreamed of denying that, as literature in novel-form, _Les\r\nMisérables_ and _L'Homme Qui Rit_ and _Quatre-Vingt-Treize_ are great,\r\nand that _Les Travailleurs de la Mer_ is of the greatest.[335] And on\r\nthe other hand, while strong exceptions have been taken from several\r\nsides to the work of George Sand, the fact remains--and no attempt has\r\nbeen made to obscure or to shake it--that George Sand gave novel\r\ndelectation, in no vulgar fashion, and to no small extent in the form of\r\nthe pure novel itself, probably to as large a number of readers as any\r\nnovelist except Scott and Dumas; and perhaps Dickens, has ever given. Of\r\nthe miraculous production of Dumas himself almost enough should have\r\nbeen said before, though a little more may come after; and whatever\r\ncontroversy there may be about its purely literary value, there\r\ncan--with reasonable people who are prepared to give and take--be little\r\nanxiety to deny that each of these three, like Balzac, might have taken\r\nthe burden of the period on his or her own shoulders, while as a matter\r\nof fact they have but to take each a corner. Nor, even when thus\r\ndivided, is the burden left wholly to them. The utmost perfection, at\r\nleast in the short story, is reached by Mérimée and Gautier, little less\r\nthan such perfection by others. For suggestions of new kinds and new\r\ntreatments, if for no single performance, few periods, if any, have a\r\nsuperior to Beyle.\r\n\r\nBut, once more, just as the time need not rely on any single champion of\r\nits greatest to maintain its position, so, if all the greater names just\r\nmentioned were struck out, it would still be able to \"make good\" by dint\r\nof the number, the talent, the variety, the novelty of its second- and\r\nthird-rate representatives. Even those who may think that I have taken\r\nPaul de Kock too seriously cannot deny--for it is a simple fact--the\r\nvigorous impulse that he gave to the _popularity_ of the novel as a form\r\nof the printed book, if not of literature; while I can hardly imagine\r\nany one who takes the trouble to examine this fact refusing to admit\r\nthat it is largely due to an advance in reality of a kind--though they\r\nmay think this kind itself but a shady and sordid one. On the other\r\nhand, I think less of Eugène Sue than at one time \"men of good\" used to\r\nthink; but I, in my turn, should not dream of denying his popularity, or\r\nthe advance which he too effected in procuring for the novel its share,\r\nand a vast share, in the attention of the general reader. Jules Sandeau\r\nand Charles de Bernard, Soulié and Féval and Achard, and not a few\r\nothers mentioned or not mentioned in the text, come up to support their\r\npriors, while, as I have endeavoured to point out, two others still,\r\nCharles Nodier and Gérard de Nerval, though it may seem absurd to claim\r\nprimacy for them, contribute that idiosyncrasy without which, whether it\r\nbe sufficient to establish primacy or not, nothing can ever claim to\r\npossess that quality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The kinds--the historical novel.]\r\n\r\nBut while it is not necessary to repeat the favourable estimates already\r\ngiven of individuals, it is almost superfluous to rest the claims of the\r\nperiod to importance in novel history upon them. Elsewhere[336] I have\r\nlaid some emphatic and reiterated stress on the mischief which has\r\nsometimes arisen from too exclusive critical attention to \"kinds,\"\r\nclasses, and the like in literature--to the oblivion or obscuring of\r\nindividual men and works of letters. But as there has been, and I hope\r\nwill be, no ignoring of individuals here, and as this whole book\r\nendeavours to be a history of a kind, remarks on subdivisions of that\r\nkind as such can hardly be regarded as inopportune or inconsistent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appearance of new classes--the historical.]\r\n\r\nNow it is impossible that anybody who is at all inclined or accustomed\r\nto think about the characteristics of the pleasure he receives from\r\nliterature, should not have noticed in this period the fact--beside and\r\noutside of the other fact of a provision of delectable novelists--of a\r\ngreat splitting up and (as scientific slang would put it) fissiparous\r\ngeneration of the the classes of novel. It is, indeed, open to the\r\nadvocates or generic or specific criticism--though I think they cannot\r\npossibly maintain their position as to poetry--to urge that a great deal\r\nof harm was done to the novel, or at least that its development was\r\nunnecessarily retarded, by the absence of this division earlier. And in\r\nparticular they might lay stress on the fortunes and misfortunes of the\r\nhistorical element. That element had at least helped to start--and had\r\nlargely provided the material of--the earlier verse-romances and stories\r\ngenerally; but the entire absence of criticism at the time had merged\r\nit, almost or altogether, in mere fiction. It had played, as we saw, a\r\ngreat part in the novels of the seventeenth century; but it had for the\r\nmost part merely \"got in the way\" of its companion ingredients and in\r\nits own. I have admitted that there are diversities of opinion as to its\r\nvalue in the _Astrée_; but I hold strongly to my own that it would be\r\nmuch better away there. I can hardly think that any one, uninfluenced by\r\nthe sillier, not the nobler, estimate of the classics, can think that\r\nthe \"heroic\" novels gain anything, though they may possibly not lose\r\nvery much, by the presence in them of Cyrus and Clélia, Arminius and\r\nCandace, Roxana and Scipio. But perhaps the most fruitful example for\r\nconsideration is _La Princesse de Clèves_. Here, small as is the total\r\nspace, there is a great deal of history and a crowd, if for the most\r\npart mute, of historical persons. But not one of these has the very\r\nslightest importance in the story; and the Prince and the Princess and\r\nthe Duke--we may add the Vidame--who are the only figures that _have_\r\nimportance, might be the Prince and Princess of Kennaquhair, the Duke of\r\nChose, and the Vidame of Gonesse, in any time or no time since the\r\ncreation of the world, while retaining their fullest power of situation\r\nand appeal.\r\n\r\nBut this side of the matter is of far less consequence than another.\r\nThis historical element of the _historia mixta_[337] was not merely\r\nrather a nuisance and quite a superfluity as regarded the whole of the\r\nstories in which it appeared; but its presence there and the tricks that\r\nhad to be played with it prevented the development of the historical\r\nnovel proper--that, as it has been ticketed, \"bodiless childful of\r\nlife,\" which waited two thousand years in the ante-natal gloom before it\r\ncould get itself born. Here, indeed, one may claim--and I suppose no\r\nsensible Frenchmen would for a moment hesitate to admit it--that even\r\nmore than in the case of Richardson's influence nearly a century\r\nearlier, help came to their Troy from a Greek city. To France as to\r\nEngland, and to all the world, Scott unlocked the hoard of this\r\ndelightful variety of fictitious literature, though it was not quite at\r\nonce that she took advantage of the treasury.\r\n\r\nBut when she did, the way in which she turned over the borrowed capital\r\nwas certainly amazing, and for a long time she quite distanced the\r\nfollowers of Scott himself in England. James, Ainsworth, and even Bulwer\r\ncannot possibly challenge comparison with the author of _Notre Dame de\r\nParis_ as writers, or with Dumas as story-tellers; and it was not till\r\nthe second half of the century was well advanced, and when Dumas' own\r\nbest days were very nearly over, that England, with Thackeray's _Esmond_\r\nand Kingsley's _Westward Ho!_ and Charles Reade's _The Cloister and the\r\nHearth_, re-formed the kind afresh into something which France has never\r\nyet been able to rival.\r\n\r\nIn order, however, to obviate any possible charge of insular unfairness,\r\nit may be well to note that Chateaubriand, though he had never reached\r\n(or in all probability attempted to reach) anything of the true Scott\r\nkind, had made a great advance in something the same direction, and had\r\nindeed to some extent sketched a different variety of historical novel\r\nfrom Scott's own; while, before Scott's death, Victor Hugo imbued the\r\nScott romance itself with intenser doses of passion, of the subsidiary\r\ninterests of art, etc., and of what may be in a way called \"theory,\"\r\nthan Scott had cared for. In fact, the Hugonic romance is a sort of\r\nblending of Scott and Byron, with a good deal of the author's country,\r\nand still more of himself, added. The connection again between Scott and\r\nDumas is simpler and less blended with other influences; the chief\r\ndifferences should have been already pointed out. But the important\r\nthing to notice is that, with a few actual gaps, and several patches\r\nwhich have been more fully worked over and occupied than others,\r\npractically the whole of French history from the fourteenth century to,\r\nand including, the Revolution was \"novelised\" by the wand of this second\r\nmagician.[338]\r\n\r\nThat the danger of the historical variety was entirely avoided by these\r\nits French practitioners cannot indeed be said. Even Scott had not\r\nwholly got the better of it in his less perfect pieces, such, for\r\ninstance, as those already glanced-at parts of _The Monastery_, where\r\nhistorical _récit_ now and then supplies the place of vigorous\r\nnovel-action and talk. Dumas' co-operative habits (which are as little\r\nto be denied as they are to be exaggerated) lent themselves to it much\r\nmore freely. But, notwithstanding this, the total accession of pleasure\r\nto the novel-reader was immense, and the further possibility of such\r\naccession practically unlimited. And accordingly the kind, though\r\nsometimes belittled by foolish criticism, and sometimes going out of\r\nfavour by the vicissitudes of mere fashion, has constantly renewed\r\nitself, and is likely to do so. Its special advantages and its special\r\nwarnings are of some interest to discuss briefly. Among the first may be\r\nranked something which the foolish belittlers above mentioned entirely\r\nfail to appreciate, and indeed positively dislike. The danger of the\r\nnovel of ordinary and contemporary life (which accompanied this and\r\nwhich is to be considered shortly as such) is that there may be so much\r\n_mere_ ordinariness and contemporariness that the result may be\r\ndistasteful, if not sickening, to future ages. This has (to take one\r\nexample out of many) happened with the novels of so clever a person as\r\nTheodore Hook in England, even with comparatively elect judges; with the\r\nvulgar it is said to have happened even with such consummate things as\r\nthose of Miss Austen. With a large number of another sort of vulgar it\r\nis said to happen with \"Victorian\" novels generally, while even the\r\nelect sometimes find it difficult to prevent its happening with\r\nEdwardian and Fifth Georgian. Now the historical novelist has before him\r\nthe entire range of the most interesting fashions, manners, incidents,\r\ncharacters, literary styles of recorded time. He has but to select from\r\nthis inexhaustible store of general material, and to charge it with\r\nsufficient power of humanity of all time, and the thing is done.[339]\r\nUnder no circumstances can the best historical novels ever lose their\r\nattraction with the best readers; and as for the others in each kind,\r\nwho cares what happens to _them_?\r\n\r\nThere are, moreover, some interesting general rules about the historical\r\nnovel which are well worth a moment's notice, even if this partake to\r\nsome extent of the nature of repetition. The chief of them, which at\r\nleast ought to be well known, is that it is never safe to make a\r\nprominent historical character, and seldom safe to make a prominent\r\nhistorical event, the central subject of your story. The reason is of\r\ncourse obvious. The generally known facts cramp and hamper the writer;\r\nhe is constantly knocking against them, and finding them in the way of\r\nthe natural development of his tale. No doubt there is, and has been, a\r\ngood deal of otiose and even rather silly criticism of details in\r\nhistorical novels which do not satisfy the strict historian. The fuss\r\nwhich some people used to make about Scott's anachronisms in _Ivanhoe_\r\nand _Kenilworth_; the shakings of heads which ought to know better, over\r\nThackeray's dealings with the Old Chevalier and his scandals about Miss\r\nOglethorpe in _Esmond_, can be laughed or wondered at merely. But then\r\nthese are matters of no importance to the main story. It is Ivanhoe and\r\nRebecca, Henry Esmond and Beatrix,[340] all of them persons absolutely\r\nunknown to history, in whom we are really interested; and in the other\r\ncase mentioned, Amy Robsart is such a creature or \"daughter,\" if not \"of\r\ndreams\" \"of debate,\" that you may do almost what you like with her; and\r\nthe book does not sin by presentation of a Leicester so very different\r\nfrom the historical.[341] But, on the other hand, the introduction of\r\nhistorical persons, skilfully used, seasons, enforces, and vivifies the\r\ninterest of a book mightily; and the action of great historical scenes\r\nsupports that of the general plot in a still more remarkable manner. On\r\nthe whole, we may perhaps say that Dumas depends more on the latter,\r\nScott on the former, and that the difference is perhaps connected with\r\ntheir respective bulk and position as dramatists. Dumas has made of no\r\nhistorical magnate anything like what Scott has made of Richard and of\r\nMary and of Elizabeth; but Scott has not laid actual historical scenes\r\nunder contribution to anything like the same extent as that by which\r\nDumas has in a fashion achieved a running panorama-companion to the\r\nhistory of France from the fourteenth century to the Revolution and,\r\nmore intensively, from the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew to the\r\nestablishment of Louis XIV.'s autocracy.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the advantages, both to the novelist and to his readers, of the\r\nhistorical kind can hardly be exaggerated. The great danger of invented\r\nprose narrative--of _all_ invented narrative, indeed, prose or\r\nverse--has always been, and has always from the first shown itself as\r\nbeing, that of running into moulds. In the old epics (the Classical, not\r\nthe _Chansons_) this danger was accentuated by the rise of\r\nrule-criticism; but the facts had induced, if they did not justify, that\r\nrule-system itself. The monotony of the mediaeval romance, whether\r\n_Chanson_ or _Roman_, has been declared more than once in this book to\r\nbe exaggerated, but it certainly exists. The \"heroic\" succumbs to a\r\nsimilar fate rather fatally, though the heroic element itself comes\r\nslightly to the rescue; and even the picaresque by no means escapes. To\r\ndescend, or rather to look, into the gutter for a moment, the sameness\r\nof the deliberately obscene novel is a byword to those who, in pursuit\r\nof knowledge, have incurred the necessity of \"washing themselves in\r\nwater and being unclean until the evening\"; and we saw that even such a\r\nlight and lively talent as Crébillon's, keeping above the very lowest\r\ngutter-depths, could not escape the same danger wholly. In the upper air\r\nthe fairy-tale flies too often in prescribed gyres; and the most modern\r\nkinds of all--the novel of analysis, the problem-novel, and all the rest\r\nof them--strive in vain to avoid the curse of--as Rabelais put something\r\nnot dissimilar long ago--\"fatras _à la douzaine_.\" \"All the stories are\r\ntold,\" saith the New, even as the Old, Preacher; all but the highest\r\ngenius is apt to show ruts, brain-marks, common orientations of route\r\nand specifications of design. Only the novel of creative--not merely\r\nsynthetised--character in the most expert hands escapes--for human\r\ncharacter undoubtedly partakes of the Infinite; but few are they who can\r\ncommand the days and ways of creation.\r\n\r\nYet though history has its unaltering laws; though human nature in\r\ngeneral is always the same; though that which hath been shall be, and\r\nthe dreams of new worlds and new societies are the most fatuous of vain\r\nimaginations--the details of historical incident vary as much as those\r\nof individual character or feature, and the whole of recorded time\r\noffers them, more than half ready for use, in something like the same\r\ncondition as those patterns of work which ladies buy, fill up, and\r\nregard as their own. To make an historical novel of the very highest\r\nclass, such as the best of Scott and Thackeray, requires of course very\r\nmuch more than this--to make one of all but the highest class, such as\r\n_Les Trois Mousquetaires_, requires much more. But that \"tolerable\r\npastime,\" which it is the business of the average novelist to supply at\r\nthe demand of the average reader, can perhaps be attained more easily,\r\nmore abundantly, and with better prospect of average satisfaction in the\r\nhistorical way than in any other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other kinds and classes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Novel of Romanticism generally.]\r\n\r\nIt would, however, of course be an intolerable absurdity to rest the\r\nclaims of the French novel of 1825 to 1850 wholly--it would be somewhat\r\nabsurd to rest them mainly--on its performances in this single kind. It\r\nfound out, continued, or improved many others; and perhaps most of its\r\ngreatest achievements were in these others. In fact \"others\" is an\r\nincorrect or at least an inexact term; for the historic novel itself is\r\nonly a subdivision or offshoot of the great literary revolution which we\r\ncall Romanticism. Indeed the entire novel of the nineteenth century,\r\nmisapprehend the fact as people may, is in fact Romantic, from the first\r\nnovel of Chateaubriand to the last of Zola, though the Romanticism is\r\nchequered and to a certain extent warped by that invincible French\r\ndetermination towards \"Rule\" which has vindicated itself so often, and\r\non which shortly we may have to make something almost like an excursus.\r\nBut this very fact, if nothing else, would make a discussion of the\r\nRomantic novel as such out of place _here_; it will have to come, to\r\nsome extent at any rate, in the Conclusion itself. Only for the present\r\nneed it be said, without quite the same danger of meeting with scornful\r\nor indignant protest, that all the books hitherto discussed from _René_\r\nto _Dominique_, from _Le Solitaire_ to _Monte Cristo_--even the work of\r\nMérimée and Sainte-Beuve, those celebrated \"apostates\" as some would\r\nhave them to be--is really Romantic. It may follow the more poetical\r\nromanticism of Nodier and Hugo, of Gautier and Gérard; the historical\r\nromanticism of Vigny and Mérimée; the individualism and analysis of\r\nBeyle and his disciples; the supernaturalism of George Sand and Nodier\r\nagain; the adventurous incident of Sue and Soulié and Dumas and the\r\nDumasians generally; it may content itself with that modified form of\r\nthe great Revolt which admits \"low\" or \"middle\" subjects and discards\r\nthe classical theories that a hero ought to be dignified. But always\r\nthere is something of the general Romantic colour about--something over\r\nwhich M. Nisard has shaken or would have shaken his respectable\r\n_perruque_.[342]\r\n\r\nSo turn we to the other larger group--the largest group of all that come\r\nunder our survey--the New Ordinary Novel, that which concerns itself\r\nwith the last shade of his colour just described.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"ordinary.\"]\r\n\r\nWe had seen, before the beginning of this volume, how Pigault-Lebrun, in\r\nvulgar ways and with restricted talent, had nevertheless made distinct\r\nadvances in this direction; and we saw in the beginning of this how Paul\r\nde Kock--with something of the same limitations but with the advantage\r\nof a predecessor in Pigault and of further changes in society towards\r\nthe normal--improved upon the earlier progression. But Pigault and Paul\r\nwere thrown into the shade by those writers, younger contemporaries of\r\nboth, who brought to their task greater genius, better taste, and if not\r\nknowledge of better society, at any rate better knowledge how to use\r\ntheir knowledge. Whether Balzac's books can be ticketed _sans phrase_,\r\nas \"novels of _ordinary_ life,\" has been, or should have been, duly\r\ndiscussed already. It is certain that, as a rule, they intend to be so.\r\nSo it is with at least the majority of George Sand's; so with all those\r\nof her first lover and half name-father Sandeau; so with Charles de\r\nBernard; so with some at least of Mérimée's best short stories and\r\nMusset's, if not exactly of Gautier's; so with others who have had\r\nplaces, and a good many more for whom no place could be found. France,\r\nindeed, may be said to have caught up and passed England in this kind,\r\nbetween the time when Miss Austen died and that when Thackeray at last\r\ndid justice to himself with _Vanity Fair_. And this novel of ordinary\r\nlife has continued, and shows no signs of ceasing, to be the kind most\r\nin demand, according to the usual law of \"Like to Like.\" We shall see\r\nfurther developments of it and shall have to exercise careful critical\r\ndiscretion in deciding whether the apparent improvement only means\r\nnearer approximation to our own standard of ordinariness, or to a more\r\nabstract one. But that it was in these twenty or five and twenty years\r\nthat something like a norm of ordinariness was first reached, hardly\r\nadmits of any question. Still, very much question may arise, and must be\r\nfaced, on the point whether this novel of ordinary life has not\r\nredeveloped a _non_-ordinary subdivision, or many such, in the \"problem\"\r\nnovel, the novel of analysis, of abnormal individualism, of theory,\r\nnaturalist and other, etc. To this we must turn; for at least part of\r\nthis new question is a very important one, though it may require\r\nsomething of a digression to deal with it properly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discussion on a point of general novel criticism.]\r\n\r\nI have in these volumes, rather sedulously--some readers no doubt may\r\nthink too sedulously--avoided \"fighting prizes\" on general points of the\r\ncriticism or novel-theory. Not that I have the slightest objection to\r\nfighting \"for my own hand\" or to seeing or reading about a good fight\r\nbetween others--very much the contrary. I never thought it the worst\r\ncompliment paid to Englishmen--the Indian opinion of us, as reported by\r\nthe late M. Darmesteter--that we cared for nothing but fighting, sport,\r\nand making love. But the question now to be discussed is so germane to\r\nour subject, both general and special; and the discussion of it once for\r\nall (with _renvois_ thereto elsewhere) will save so much space, trouble,\r\nand inconvenience, that it may as well be handled at full length.\r\n\r\nThere was hinted--in a review[343] of the first volume of this work\r\notherwise so complimentary that it must have satisfied the Archbishop of\r\nGranada himself--a doubt whether I had given sufficient weight to\r\nsomething which I shall let the reviewer express in his own words;[344]\r\nand whether my admission of Rabelais (of which admission, except on\r\nprinciple, he was himself very glad); my relegation of Laclos to the\r\nCondemned Corps; and my comparative toleration of Pigault-Lebrun, did\r\nnot indicate heresy. Now I feel pretty certain that such a well-wisher\r\nwould hardly suspect me of doing any of these things by inadvertence;\r\nand as I must have gone, and shall still go, much further from what is\r\nthe right line in his (and no doubt others') opinion, I may as well\r\nstate my point of view here. It should supply a sort of justificatory\r\ncomment not merely on the chapters and passages just referred to, and\r\nothers in the last volume, but on a much larger number in this--in fact,\r\nafter a fashion, to the whole of this. Any difference of it from the\r\nnormal French view will even help to explain my attitude in those parts\r\nof this book (_e.g._ the remarks on Dumas _père_) to which it does not\r\ndirectly apply, as well as those (_e.g._ on Dumas _fils_) to which it\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\nThe whole question seems to me to turn on the curiously different\r\nestimates which different people make of what constitutes \"humanity.\" To\r\ncite another dictum of my friend the enemy, he, while, as I have said,\r\nspeaking with extraordinary kindness of my chapter on Rabelais in\r\nitself, disallows it in a _History of the Novel_ because, among other\r\nreasons, Panurge is not, or is very slightly, human. I should have said\r\nthat Panurge was as human as Hamlet, though certainly not so\r\n_gentle_human.[345] I never met either; but I might do so, and I am\r\nsure I should recognise both as men and brothers. Still, the comparison\r\nhere is of course somewhat rhetorical. Let us take Panurge with Laclos'\r\nValmont, whom, I think, my critic _does_ consider human; whom I am sure\r\nI never have met and never shall meet, even if I should be so\r\nunfortunate as to go to the place which (but, of course, for the\r\nconsolations of the Church) would have been his, _if_ he had been human;\r\nand whom I never could in the most impossible event or _milieu_\r\nrecognise as anything but a synthetised specification. One may perhaps\r\ndwell on this, for it is of immense importance to the general question.\r\nPanurge and Valmont, comparatively considered, have beyond doubt points\r\nin common. Both are extremely immoral, and both are--though the one only\r\nsometimes, the other always--ill-natured. Neither is a fool, though the\r\none does, or is going to do, at least one very foolish thing with his\r\neyes open; while nothing that the other does--even his provocation of\r\nMadame de Merteuil--can be said to be exactly \"foolish.\" Both are\r\nattempts to do what Thackeray said he attempted to do in most of the\r\ncharacters of _Vanity Fair_--to draw people \"living without God in the\r\nworld.\" Yet I can tolerate Panurge, and recognise him as human even when\r\nhe indirectly murders Dindenault, even when (which is worse) he behaves\r\nso atrociously to the Lady of Paris; and I cannot tolerate or validate\r\nValmont even when he excogitates and puts in practice that very\r\ningenious and picturesque idea of a writing-desk, or when he seeks the\r\nconsolations and fortifications of the Church after Danceny has done on\r\nhim the first part of the judgment of God. And I think I can give\r\nreasons, both for my intolerance and for my toleration, \"rightly and in\r\nmine own division.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason why I think that Panurge is rightly and Valmont wrongly\r\n\"copied or re-created\" is that Panurge is made at the hazard of the\r\nartist, Valmont according to prescription. There might be--there have\r\nbeen--fifty or a hundred Valmonts, the prescription being followed, and\r\nslightly--still remaining a prescription--altered. There is and can be\r\nonly one Panurge. This difference reminds me of, and may be illustrated\r\nby, a fact which, in one form or another, must be familiar to many\r\npeople. I was once talking to a lady who had just come over from China,\r\nand who wore a dress of soft figured silk of the most perfect\r\nlove-in-a-mist colour-shade which I had ever seen, even in turning over\r\nthe wonder-drawers at Liberty's. I asked her if (for she then intended\r\nto go back almost at once) she could get me any like it. \"No,\" she said,\r\n\"at least not exactly. They never make two pieces of just the same\r\nshade, and in fact they couldn't if they tried. They take handfuls of\r\ndifferent dyes, measured and mixed, as it seems, at random.\" Now that is\r\nthe way God and, in a lesser degree, the great artists work, and the\r\nresult is living creatures, according to the limitations of artistic and\r\nthe no-limitations of natural life. The others weigh out a dram of lust,\r\na scruple of cleverness, an ounce of malice, half an ounce of\r\nsuperficial good manners, etc., and say, \"Here is a character for you.\r\nType No. 12345.\" And it is not a living creature at all. But, having\r\nbeen made by regular synthesis,[346] it can be regularly analysed, and\r\npeople say, \"Oh, how clever he is.\" The first product, having grown\r\nrather than been made, defies analysis, and they say, \"How commonplace!\"\r\n\r\nOne can perhaps lay out the ropes of the ring of combat most\r\nsatisfactorily and fairly by using the distinction of the reviewer (if I\r\ndo not misunderstand him), that I have neglected the interval between\r\n\"to copy\" and \"to re-create.\" I accept this dependence, which may\r\nperhaps be illustrated further from that (in itself) foolish and vulgar\r\nboast of Edmond de Goncourt's that his and his brother's epithets were\r\n\"personal\" while Flaubert's were only \"admirably good specimens of the\r\nepithets of _tout le monde_.\"\r\n\r\nTo translate: Should the novelist aim, by _mimesis_--it is a misfortune\r\nwhich I have lamented over and over again in print that \"Imitation\" and\r\n\"Copying\" are such misleading versions of this--of actual characters, to\r\nevolve a personality which will be recognised by all competent observers\r\nas somebody whom he has actually met or might have met? Or should he,\r\ntrusting to his own personal powers of putting together qualities and\r\ntraits, but more or less neglecting the patterns which the Almighty has\r\nput before him in _tout le monde_--sometimes also regarding conventional\r\ntypes and \"academies\"--either (for this is important) to follow or\r\nviolently _not_ to follow them--produce something that owes _its_\r\npersonality to himself only? The former has been the aim of the great\r\nEnglish novelists since Fielding, if not since Richardson[347] or even\r\nDefoe. It was the aim of Lesage: he has told us so in so many words. It\r\nis by no means alien from that of Marivaux, though he did not pursue it\r\nwith a single eye; and the same may be said even of Crébillon. Whether\r\nPrévost aimed at it or not, he hit the white in _Manon_ as certainly and\r\nunmistakably as he lost his arrows elsewhere. Rousseau both did it and\r\nmeant it in the first part of _Julie_. Pigault, in a clumsy, botcherly\r\nfashion, made \"outers\" not infrequently. But Laclos seems to me to have\r\n(as his in some sense follower Dumas _fils_ has it in the passage noted\r\nabove) \"proceeded by synthesis\"--to have said, \"Let us make a\r\nmischievous Marquise and a vile Viscount. Let us deprive them of every\r\namiable quality and of every one that can be called in any sense 'good,'\r\nexcept a certain kind of intellectual ability, and, in the Viscount's\r\ncase, an ingenious fancy in the matter of extemporising writing-desks.\"\r\nAnd he did it; and then the people who think that because (to adopt the\r\nlanguage of George de Barnwell) \"the True is not always the Beautiful\"\r\nthe Ugly must always be the True, hail him as a master.[348]\r\n\r\nThat this half-digression, half-dilemma, is prospective as well as\r\nretrospective will hardly form a subject of objection for any one but a\r\nmere fault-finder. From the top of a watershed you necessarily survey\r\nboth slopes. The tendency which we have been discussing is certainly\r\nmore prevalent in the second half of the century than in the first half.\r\nIt is prominent in Dumas _fils_, with whom we shall be dealing shortly;\r\nit increases as time goes on; and it becomes almost paramount in the\r\npractice of and the discussions about the Naturalist School. In the time\r\non which we look back it is certainly important in Beyle and Balzac. But\r\nI cannot admit that it is predominant elsewhere, and I am prepared to\r\ndeny utterly that, until the time of the Sensibility and _Philosophe_\r\nnovels, it is even a notable characteristic of French fiction. Many hard\r\nthings have been said of criticism; but, acknowledging the badness of a\r\nbird who even admits any foulness in his own nest--far more in one who\r\ncauses it--I am bound to say that I think the state of the department of\r\nliterature now under discussion was happier before we meddled with it.\r\nOffence must come; it would even be sometimes rather a pity if it didn't\r\ncome: but perhaps the old saying is true in the case of those by whom\r\nsome kinds of it come. If criticism and creation could be kept as\r\nseparate as some creators pridefully pretend, it would not matter. And\r\nthe best critics never attempt to show how things should be done, but\r\nmerely to point out how they have been done--well or badly. But when men\r\nbegin to write according to criticism, they generally begin to write\r\nbadly, just as when women begin to dress themselves according to\r\nfashion-mongers they usually begin (or would but for the grace of God)\r\nto look ugly. And there are some mistakes which appear to be absolutely\r\nincorrigible. When I was a Professor of Literature I used to say every\r\nyear in so many words, as I had previously written for more than as many\r\nyears, when I was only a critic of it, \"I do not wish to teach you how\r\nto write. I wish to teach you how to read, and to tell you what there is\r\nto read.\" The same is my wish in regard to the French Novel. What has\r\nbeen done in it--not what these, even the practitioners themselves, have\r\nsaid of it--is the burden of my possibly unmusical song.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe excuse, indeed, for this long digression may be, I think, made\r\nwithout impropriety or \"forcing\" to coincide with the natural sequel and\r\ncorrelation of this chapter. The development of the novel of ordinary\r\nlife in the second half of the century _was_ extraordinary; but it was\r\nto a very large extent marked by the peculiarities--some of them near to\r\ncorruptions--which have been just discussed. With the possible exception\r\nof Beyle, there was little more theory, or attempt at synthesis in\r\naccordance therewith, in the \"ordinary\" than in the \"historical\"\r\ndivision of this earlier time. We have seen how the absence of \"general\r\nideas\"--another way of putting it--has been actually brought as a charge\r\nagainst Balzac. George Sand had, especially at first, something of it;\r\nand this something seems, to me at least, by no means to have improved\r\nher work. In none or hardly any of the rest is there any evidence of\r\n\"school,\" \"system,\" \"pattern,\" \"problem,\" or the like. Yet they give us\r\nan immense amount of pastime, and I do not think their or their readers'\r\nstate was any the less gracious for what they did _not_ give us.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[328] I have not called this so, because the division into \"Books,\" with\r\nwhich the _raison d'être_ of \"Interchapters\" is almost inseparably\r\nconnected, has not been adopted in this _History_.\r\n\r\n[329] This fact, as well, perhaps, as others, should be taken into\r\naccount by any one who may be at first sight surprised, and perhaps in\r\nthe Biblical sense \"offended,\" at finding two-thirds of the volume\r\nallotted to half of the time.\r\n\r\n[330] To vary a good epigram of the _Rolliad_ crew on Pitt:\r\n\r\n     \"'The French' for 'France' can't please the _Blanc_,\r\n         The _Bleu_ detests the 'King.'\"\r\n\r\n[331] _V. sup._ on Reybaud.\r\n\r\n[332] This is of course quite a different thing from saying that\r\npoliticians had better have nothing to do with letters, or that men of\r\nletters may not _discuss_ politics. It is when they become Ministers\r\nthat they too often disgust men and amuse angels.\r\n\r\n[333] _Adolphe_ actually belongs to the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n[334] As I write this I remember how my friend the late M. Beljame, who\r\nand whose \"tribe\" have come so nobly for English literature in France\r\nfor forty years past, was shocked long ago at my writing \"Mazar_in_\r\nLibrary,\" and refused to be consoled by my assurance that I should never\r\ndream of writing anything but \"Bibliothèque Mazar_ine_.\" But I had, and\r\nhave, no doubt on the principle.\r\n\r\n[335] I _hope_, but do not trust, that no descendant of the persons who\r\ntold Charles Lamb that Burns could not at the time be present because he\r\nwas dead, will say, \"But all these were subsequent to 1850.\"\r\n\r\n[336] In my _History of Criticism_, _passim_.\r\n\r\n[337] _V. sup._ Vol. I., on the \"heroic\" romance.\r\n\r\n[338] It seems unnecessary to repeat what has been said on Vigny and\r\nMérimée; but it is important to keep constantly in mind that they came\r\nbefore Dumas. As for the still earlier _Solitaire_, I must repeat that\r\nM. d'Arlincourt's utter failure as an individual ought not completely to\r\nobscure his importance as a pioneer in kind.\r\n\r\n[339] \"Suppose you go and do it?\" as Thackeray says of another matter,\r\nno doubt. But I am Crites, not Poietes.\r\n\r\n[340] Pedantius may urge, \"But 'James III.' is made to affect the\r\nfortunes of Esmond and Beatrix very powerfully.\" True; but he himself is\r\nby no means a _very_ \"prominent historical character,\" and the exact\r\ncircumstances of the agony of Queen Anne, and the _coup d'état_ of\r\nShrewsbury and Argyle, have still enough of the unexplained in or about\r\nthem to permit somewhat free dealing.\r\n\r\n[341] If any one says \"_Leicester's Commonwealth?_\" I say \"_The Faërie\r\nQueene?_\"\r\n\r\n[342] I intend nothing offensive in thus mentioning his attitude. In my\r\n_History of Criticism_ I have aimed at justice both to his short stage\r\nof going with, or at least not definitely against, the Romantic vein,\r\nand his much longer one of reaction. He was always vigorous in argument\r\nand dignified in manner; but his nature, when he found it, was\r\nessentially neo-classic.\r\n\r\n[343] In the _Times Literary Supplement_ for Thursday, Nov. 1, 1917.\r\n\r\n[344] \"It is vain to ask, as is the modern custom, whether the leap from\r\nthe word 'copy' to the word 'recreate' (_v. sup._ Vol. I. p. 471) does\r\nnot cover a difference in kind.... One feels that Prof. S. is rather\r\nsympathetic to that which traditional French criticism regards as\r\nessential ... close psychological analysis of motive,\" etc. And so he\r\neven questions whether what I have given, much as he likes and praises\r\nit, _is_ \"A History of The French Novel.\" But did I ever undertake to\r\ngive this _from the French point of view_, or to write a _History of\r\nFrench Novel-Criticism_? Or need I do so?\r\n\r\n[345] It might, however, be a not uninteresting matter of debate whether\r\nPanurge's conduct to the Lady of Paris was _really_ so very much worse\r\nthan part of Hamlet's to Ophelia.\r\n\r\n[346] By one of those odd coincidences which diversify and relieve\r\nliterary work, I read, for the first time in my life, and a few hours\r\n_after_ writing the above words, these in Dumas _fils'_ _Thérèse_: \"Il\r\nprocède par synthése.\" They do not there apply to authorship, but to the\r\nmotives and conduct of one of the writer's questionable quasi-heroes.\r\nBut the whole context, and the usual methods of Dumas _fils_ himself,\r\nare saturated with synthesis _by rule_. (Of course the other process is,\r\nas also according to the strict meaning of the word, \"synthetic,\" but\r\n_not_ \"by rule.\")\r\n\r\n[347] I own I see a little less of it and a little more of the other in\r\nhim; whence a certain lukewarmness with which I have sometimes been\r\nreproached.\r\n\r\n[348] My very amiable reviewer thinks that eighteenth-century French\r\nsociety _did_ behave _à la Laclos_. I don't, though I think it did _à la\r\nCrébillon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDUMAS THE YOUNGER\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Division of future subjects.]\r\n\r\nNo one who has not had some experience in writing literary\r\nhistory knows the difficulties--or perhaps I should say the\r\n\"unsatisfactorinesses\"--which attend the shepherding of examples into\r\nseparate chronological folds. But every one who has had that experience\r\nknows that mere neglect to attempt this shepherding has serious\r\ndrawbacks. In such cases there is nothing for it but a famous phrase,\r\n\"We will do what we can.\" An endeavour has been made in the last chapter\r\nto show that, about the middle of the nineteenth century, a noteworthy\r\nchange _did_ pass over French novel-literature. In a similar retrospect,\r\nat the end of the volume and the _History_, we may be able, _si Dieu\r\nnous prête vie_, to show that this change was not actually succeeded by\r\nany other of equal importance as far as our own subject goes. But the\r\nstage had, like all such things, sub-stages; and there must be\r\ncorresponding breaks, if only mechanical ones, in the narrative, to\r\navoid the distasteful \"blockiness\" resulting from their absence. After\r\nseveral changes of plan I have thought it best to divide what remains of\r\nthe subject into five chapters (to which a separate Conclusion may be\r\nadded). The first of these will be allotted, for reasons to be given, to\r\nAlexandre Dumas _fils_; the second to Gustave Flaubert, greatest by far,\r\nif not most representative, of all dealt with in this latter part of the\r\nvolume; the third to others specially of the Second Empire, but not\r\nspecially of the Naturalist School; the fourth to that School itself;\r\nand the fifth to those now defunct novelists of the Third Republic, up\r\nto the close of the century, who may not have been dealt with before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere should not, I think, be much doubt that we ought to begin with\r\nAlexandre Dumas, the son, who--though he launched his most famous novel\r\nfive years before Napoleon the Third made himself come to the throne,\r\nhad been writing for about as many earlier still, and lived till long\r\nafter the Terrible Year, and almost to the end of our own tether--is yet\r\nalmost more essentially _the_ novelist of the Second Empire than any one\r\nelse, not merely because before its end he practically gave up Novel for\r\nDrama, but for other reasons which we may hope to set forth presently.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A confession.]\r\n\r\nBefore sitting down comfortably to deal with him in my critical jacket,\r\nI have to put on, for ceremonial purposes, something of a white sheet,\r\nand to hold a candle of repentance in my hand. I have never said very\r\nmuch about the younger Dumas anywhere, and I am not conscious of any\r\npositive injustice in what I _have_ said;[349] but I do suspect a\r\ncertain imperfection of justice. This arose, as nearly all positive and\r\ncomparative injustices do, from insufficient knowledge and study. What\r\nit was exactly in him that \"put me off\" of old I could not now say; but\r\nI think it was because I did come across some of his numerous and famous\r\nfisticuffs of Preface and Dissertation and controversy. I thought then,\r\nand I still think, that the artist has something better to do than to\r\n\"fight prizes\": he has to do things worthy of the prize. \"They say. What\r\nsay they? Let them say\" should be his motto. And later, when I might\r\nhave condoned this (in the proper sense of that appallingly misused\r\nword) in virtue of his positive achievements, he had left off\r\nnovel-writing and had taken to drama, for which, in its modern forms, I\r\nhave never cared. But I fear I must make a further confession. The\r\nextravagant praise which was lavished on him by other critics, even\r\nthough they were, in some cases at least, [Greek: philoi andres], once\r\nmore proved a stumbling-block.[350] I have endeavoured to set matters\r\nright here by serious study of his novel work and some reference to the\r\nrest; so I hope that I may discard the sheet, and give the rest of the\r\ncandle to the poor, now much requiring it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His general character.]\r\n\r\nOne thing about him is clear from his first famous, though not his\r\nfirst, book[351]--a book which, as has been said, actually preceded the\r\nSecond Empire, but which has been thought to cast something of a\r\nprophetic shadow over that period of revel and rottenness--that is to\r\nsay, from _La Dame aux Camélias_--that he was even then a very clever\r\nman.[352]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Dame aux Camélias._]\r\n\r\n\"The Lady with the Camellias\" is not now the widely known book that once\r\nit was; and the causes of its loss of vogue might serve as a text for\r\nsome \"Meditations among the Tombs,\" though in respect of rather\r\ndifferent cemeteries from those which Addison or Hervey frequented. As a\r\nmere audacity it has long faded before the flowers, themselves \"over\"\r\nnow, of that Naturalism which it helped to bring about; and the once\r\nworld-popular composer who founded almost, if not quite, his most\r\npopular opera on it, has become for many years an abomination and a\r\nhissing to the very same kind of person who, sixty years since, would\r\nhave gone out of his way to extol _La Traviata_, and have found in _Il\r\nTrovatore_ something worth not merely all Rossini[353] and Bellini and\r\nDonizetti put together, but _Don Giovanni_, the _Zauberflöte_, and\r\n_Fidelio_ thrown in; while if (as he might) he had known _Tannhäuser_\r\nand _Lohengrin_ he would have lifted up his hoof against them. It is the\r\nnature of the fool of all times to overblame what the fools of other\r\ntimes have overpraised. But the fact that these changes have happened,\r\nand that other accidents of time have edulcorated that general ferocity\r\nwhich made even men of worth in England refuse to lament the death of\r\nthe Prince Imperial in our service, should on the whole be rather\r\nfavourable to a quiet consideration of this remarkable book. Indeed, I\r\ndaresay some, if not many, of the \"warm young men\" to whom the very word\r\n\"tune\" is anathema might read the words, \"Veux-tu que nous quittions\r\nParis?\" without having their pure and tender minds and ears sullied and\r\nlacerated by the remembrance of \"Parigi, O cara, noi lasceremo\"--simply\r\nbecause they never heard it.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable book it is. Camellias have gone out of fashion, which\r\nis a great pity, for a more beautiful flower in itself does not exist:\r\nand those who have seen, in the Channel Islands, a camellia tree, as big\r\nas a good-sized summer-house, clothed with snow, and the red blossoms\r\nand green leaf-pairs unconcernedly slashing the white garment, have seen\r\none of the prettiest sights in the world. But I should not dream of\r\ntransferring the epithets \"beautiful\" or even \"pretty\" from the flower\r\nto the book. It _is_ remarkable, and it is clever in no derogatory\r\nsense. For it has pathos without mere sentiment, and truth, throwing a\r\nlight on humanity, which is not wholly or even mainly like that of\r\n\r\n                   The blackguard boy\r\n    That runs his link full in your face.\r\n\r\nThe story of it is, briefly, as follows. Marguerite Gautier, its\r\nheroine, is one of the most beautiful and popular _demi-mondaines_ of\r\nParis, also a _poitrinaire_,[354] and as this, if not as the other, the\r\npet and protégée, in a _quasi_-honourable fashion, of an old duke, whose\r\ndaughter, closely resembling Marguerite, has actually died of\r\nconsumption. But she does not give up her profession; and the duke in a\r\nmanner, though not willingly, winks at it. One evening at the theatre a\r\nyoung man, Armand Duval, who, though by no means innocent, is shy and\r\n_gauche_, is introduced to her, and she laughs at him. But he falls\r\nfrantically in love with her, and after some interval meets her again.\r\nThe passion becomes mutual, and for some time she gives herself up\r\nwholly to him. But the duke cannot stand this open _affiche_, and\r\nwithdraws his allowances. Duval is on the point of ruining himself (he\r\nis a man of small means, partly derived from his father) for her, while\r\nshe intends to sell all she has, pay her debts, and, as we may say,\r\nplunge into mutual ruin with him. Then appears the father, who at last\r\nmakes a direct and effective appeal to her. She returns to business,\r\nenraging her lover, who departs abroad. Before he comes back, her\r\nhealth, and with it her professional capacity, breaks down, and she dies\r\nin agony, leaving pathetic explanations of what has driven him away from\r\nher. A few points in this bare summary may be enlarged on presently.\r\nEven from it a certain resemblance, partly of a topsy-turvy kind, may be\r\nperceived by a reader of not less than ordinary acuteness to _Manon\r\nLescaut_. The suggestion, such as it is, is quite frankly admitted, and\r\nan actual copy of Prévost's masterpiece figures not unimportantly in the\r\ntale.[355] Of the difference between the two, again presently.\r\n\r\nThe later editions of _La Dame aux Camélias_ open with an \"Introduction\"\r\nby Jules Janin, dealing with a certain Marie Duplessis--the recently\r\nliving original, as we are told, of Marguerite Gautier. A good deal has\r\nbeen said, not by any means always approvingly, of this system of\r\n\"introductions,\" especially to novels. In the present instance I should\r\nsay that the proceeding was dangerous but effective--perhaps not\r\nentirely in the way in which it was intended to be so. \"Honest\r\nJanin,\"[356] as Thackeray (who had deservedly rapped his knuckles\r\nearlier for a certain mixture of ignorance and impudence) called him\r\nlater, was in his degree almost as \"clever\" a man as young Dumas; but\r\nhis kind was different, and it did involve the derogatory connotation of\r\ncleverness. It is enough to say of the present subject that it displays,\r\nin almost the highest strength, the insincerity and superficiality of\r\nmatter and thought which accompanied Janin's bright and almost brilliant\r\nfacility of expression and style. His Marie Duplessis is one of those\r\nremarkable young persons who, to alter Dr. Johnson very slightly, unite\r\n\"the manners of a _duchess_ with the morals of\" the other object of the\r\ndoctor's comparison unaltered; superadding to both the amiability of an\r\nangel, the beauty of Helen, and the taste in art of all the great\r\ncollectors rolled into one. The thing is pleasantly written bosh; and,\r\nexcept to those readers who are concerned to know that they are going to\r\nread about \"a real person,\" can be no commendation, and might even cause\r\na little disgust, not at all from the moral but from the purely critical\r\nside.\r\n\r\nA lover of paradox might almost suggest that \"honest Janin\" had been\r\nplaying the ingenious but dangerous finesse of intentionally setting up\r\na foil to his text. He has certainly, to some tastes, done this. There\r\nis hardly any false prettiness, any sham Dresden china (a thing, by the\r\nway, that has become almost a proverbial phrase in French for\r\n_demi-monde_ splendour), about _La Dame aux Camélias_ itself. Nor, on\r\nthe other hand, is there to be found in it--even in such anticipated\r\n\"naturalisms\" as the exhumation of Marguerite's _two_-months'-old\r\ncorpse,[357] and one or two other somewhat more veiled but equally or\r\nmore audacious touches of realism--anything resembling the exaggerated\r\nhorrors of such efforts of 1830 itself as Janin's own _Âne Mort_ and\r\npart of Borel's _Champavert_. In her splendour as in her misery, in her\r\nfrivolity as in her devotion and self-sacrifice, repulsive as this\r\ncontrast may conventionally be, Marguerite is never impossible or\r\nunnatural. Her chief companion of her own sex, Prudence Duvernoy,\r\nthough, as might be expected, a good deal of a _proxénète_, and by no\r\nmeans disinterested in other ways, is also very well drawn, and assists\r\nthe general effect more than may at first be seen.\r\n\r\nThe \"problem\" of the book, at least to English readers, lies in the\r\nperson whom it is impossible to call the hero--Armand Duval. It would be\r\nvery sanguine to say that he is unnatural; but the things that he does\r\nare rather appalling. That he listens at doors, opens letters not\r\naddressed to him, and so on, is sufficiently fatal; but a very generous\r\nextension of lovers' privileges may perhaps just be stretched over these\r\nthings.[358] No such licence will run to other actions of his. In his\r\nearly days of chequered possession he writes, anonymously, an insulting\r\nletter to his mistress, which she forgives; but he has at least the\r\ngrace to repent of this almost immediately. His conduct, however, when\r\nhe returns to Paris, after staying in the country with his family, and\r\nfinds that she has returned to her old ways, is the real crime. A\r\nviolent scene might, again, be excusable, for he does not know what his\r\nfather has done. But for weeks this young gentleman of France devotes\r\nall his ingenuity and energies to tormenting and insulting the object of\r\nhis former adoration. He ostentatiously \"keeps\" a beautiful but\r\nworthless friend of hers in her own class, and takes every opportunity\r\nof flaunting the connection in Marguerite's face. He permits himself and\r\nthis creature to insult her in every way, apparently descending once\r\nmore to anonymous letters. And when her inexhaustible forgiveness has\r\ninduced a temporary but passionate reconciliation, he takes fresh\r\numbrage, and sends money to her for her complaisance with another letter\r\nof more abominable insult than ever. Now it is bad to insult any one of\r\nwhom you have been fond; worse to insult any woman; but to insult a\r\nprostitute, faugh![359]\r\n\r\nHowever, I may be reading too much English taste into French ways\r\nhere,[360] and it is impossible to deny that a man, whether French or\r\nEnglish, _might_ behave in this ineffable manner. In other words, the\r\nirresistible _humanum est_ clears this as it clears Marguerite's own\r\ngood behaviour, so conventionally inconsistent with her bad. The book,\r\nof course, cannot possibly be put on a level with its pattern and\r\ninspiration, _Manon Lescaut_: it is on a much lower level of literature,\r\nlife, thought, passion--everything. But it has literature; it has life\r\nand thought and passion; and so it shall have no black mark here.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Tristan le Roux._]\r\n\r\nFew things could be more different from each other than _Tristan le\r\nRoux_--another early book of Dumas _fils_--is from _La Dame aux\r\nCamélias_. Indeed it is a good, if not an absolutely certain, sign that\r\nso young a man should have tried styles in novel-writing so far apart\r\nfrom each other. _Tristan_ is a fifteenth-century story of the later\r\npart of the Hundred Years' War, and of Gilles de Retz, and of Joan of\r\nArc, and of _diablerie_, and so forth. I first heard approval of it from\r\na person whose name may be unexpected by some readers--the late\r\nProfessor Robertson Smith. But the sometime editor of the _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_ was exceptionally well qualified for the literary side of\r\nhis office, and could talk about French quite as knowledgeably as he\r\ncould about Arabic and Hebrew.[361] He was rather enthusiastic about the\r\nbook, an enthusiasm which, when I myself came to read it, for a\r\nconsiderable time puzzled me a little. It opens pretty well, but already\r\nwith a good deal of the \"possible-improbable\" about it; for when some\r\ntwenty wolves have once pulled a horse down and a man off it, his chance\r\nof escaping (especially without revolvers) seems small, even though two\r\nrescuers come up, one of whom has a knack of shooting these\r\ncreatures[362] and the other of throttling them. It is on these rescuers\r\nthat the central interest of the story turns. Olivier de Karnak and\r\nTristan le Roux are, though they do not at the time know it, brothers by\r\nthe same mother, the guiltless Countess of Karnak having been drugged,\r\nviolated, and made a mother by Gilles de Retz's father. They are also\r\nrivals for the love of their cousin Alix, and as she prefers Olivier,\r\nthis sends Tristan literally \"to the Devil.\" The compact is effected by\r\nmeans of a Breton sorceress, who has been concerned in the earlier\r\ncrime, and is an accomplice of Gilles himself. That eminent patriot\r\nperforms,[363] for Tristan's benefit or ruin, one of his black masses,\r\nwith a murdered child's blood for wine. Further _diablerie_ opens a\r\ngreat tomb near Poitiers, where, seven hundred years earlier, in Charles\r\nMartel's victory, an ancestor of the Karnaks has been buried alive,\r\nwith the Saracen Emir he had just slain, by the latter's followers; and\r\nwhere the two have beguiled the time by continuous ghostly fighting. The\r\nSaracen, when the tomb is opened, evades, seen by no one but Tristan,\r\nand becomes the apostate's by no means guardian devil. Then we have the\r\nintroduction of the Maid (whom Tristan is specially set by his master to\r\ncatch), the siege of Orleans and the rest of it, to the tragedy of\r\nRouen.\r\n\r\nUp to this point--that is to say, for some seven-eighths of the book--I\r\nconfess that I did not, and do not, think much of it. I am very fond of\r\nfighting in novels; and of _diablerie_ even \"more than reason\"; and of\r\nthe Middle Ages; and of many other things connected with the work. But\r\nit does not seem to me well managed or well told. One never can make out\r\nwhether the \"Sarrazin\" is, as he is actually sometimes called, Satan\r\nhimself, or not. If he is not, why call him so? If he is, why was there\r\nso little evidence of his being constantly employed in fighting with M.\r\nde Karnak between the Battle of Poitiers (not ours, but the other) and\r\nthe Siege of Orleans? I love my Dark and Middle Ages; but I should say\r\nthat there was considerable diabolic activity in them, outside tombs. Or\r\nwas the Princedom of the Air \"in commission\" all that time? Minor\r\nimprobabilities constantly jar, and there are numerous small blunders of\r\nfact[364] of the unintentional kind, which irritate more than\r\nintentional ones of some importance.\r\n\r\nBut at the end the book improves quite astonishingly. Tristan, as has\r\nbeen said, has been specially commissioned by the fiend to effect the\r\nruin of Joan. He has induced his half-brother, Gilles de Retz--not,\r\nindeed, to take the English side, for patriotism, as is well known, was\r\nthe one redeeming point of that extremely loathsome person, but--to join\r\nthe seigneurs who were malcontent with her, and if possible drug her and\r\nviolate her, a process, as we have seen, quite congenial, hereditarily\r\nas well as otherwise, to M. de Laval. He is foiled, of course, and\r\npardoned. But Tristan himself openly takes the English side, inflicts\r\ngreat damage on his countrymen, and after our defeat at the bastilles or\r\nbastides round Orleans, resumes his machinations against Joan, helps to\r\neffect her capture, and does his utmost to torment and insult her, and\r\nif possible resume Gilles's attempt, in her imprisonment; while, on the\r\ncontrary, his brother Olivier (they are both disguised as monks) works\r\non her side, nearly saves her,[365] and attends her on the scaffold. It\r\nis somewhat earlier than this that the author, as has been said, \"wakes\r\nup\" and wakes _us_ up. When Tristan, admitted to Joan's cell, designs\r\nthe same outrage to which he had counselled his brother, it is the\r\nMaid's assumption of her armour to protect herself from him that (in\r\nthis point for once historically) seals her fate. But at the very last\r\nhis hatred is changed, _not_ at all impossibly or improbably, to violent\r\nlove as she smiles on him from the fire; and he sees the legendary dove\r\nmount to heaven, after he himself has flung to her, at her dying cry, an\r\nimprovised crucifix, or at least cross. And then a choice miracle\r\nhappens, told with almost all the vigour of the \"Vin de Porto\" itself.\r\nTristan seeks absolution, but is, though not harshly, refused, before\r\npenitence and penance. He begs his brother Olivier's pardon, and is\r\nagain refused--this time with vituperation--but bears it calmly. He\r\ntakes, meekly, more insult from the very executioner. At last he makes\r\nthe sign of the compact and summons the \"Saracen\" fiend. And then, after\r\na very good conversation, in which the Devil uses all his powers of\r\nsarcasm to show his victim that, as usual, he has sold his soul for\r\nnaught, Tristan draws his sword, calls on the Trinity, Our Lady, and\r\nJoan, and one of the strangest though not of the worst fights in fiction\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\nThe Red Bastard is himself almost a giant; but the Saracen is a fiend,\r\nand though it seems that in this case the Devil _can_ be dead, he can,\r\nit seems also, only be killed at Poitiers in his original tomb. So\r\n\r\n    They wrestle up, they wrestle down,\r\n    They wrestle still and sore,\r\n\r\nfor two whole years, the Demon constantly giving ground and misleading\r\nhis enemy as much as he can. But Tristan, in the strength of repentance\r\nand with Joan's unseen help, lives, fights, and forces the fiend back\r\nover half France and half the world. By a good touch, after long combat,\r\nthe Devil tries to tempt his adversary on the side of chivalry, asking\r\nto be allowed to drink at a stream on a burning day, to warm himself at\r\na fire they pass in a snow-storm, to rest a moment. But Tristan has the\r\nsingle word \"Non!\" for any further pact with or concession to the Evil\r\nOne; the two years' battle wears away his sin; and at last he finds\r\nhimself pressing his fainting foe towards the very tomb in the fields of\r\nPoitou. It opens, and the combatants entering, find themselves by the\r\nactual graves. They drop their swords and now literally wrestle. Tristan\r\nwins, throws the Saracen into his own tomb, and runs him through the\r\nbody, once more inflicting on him such death as he may undergo.[366]\r\n\r\nThere is a grandiose extravagance about it which is really\r\nOriental;[367] and perhaps it was this which conciliated Robertson\r\nSmith, as it certainly reconciled me.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Antonine._]\r\n\r\nA third \"book of the beginning,\" _Antonine_, is far inferior to these.\r\nIt is, in fact, little more than a decentish Paul-de-Kockery, with a\r\nwould-be philosophical conclusion. Two young men, Gustave Daunont and\r\nEdmond de Péreux, saunter after breakfast looking for young ladies'\r\nankles, and Edmond sees a pair so beautiful that he follows the\r\npossessor and her unobservant father home. Having then ascertained that\r\nthe father is a doctor, he adopts the surprisingly brilliant expedient\r\nof going to consult him, and so engineering an entry. _He_ thinks there\r\nis nothing the matter with him; but the doctor (it was apparently \"at\r\ntemp. of tale\"--1834, while the port was getting ready,--the practice of\r\nFrench physicians, to receive their patients in dressing-gowns)\r\ndiscovers that he is in an advanced stage of Dumas _fils'_ favourite\r\n_poitrine_. He says, however, nothing about it (which seems odd) to his\r\npatient, merely prescribing roast-meat and Bordeaux; but (which seems\r\nodder) he _does_ mention it to his daughter Antonine, the Lady with the\r\nAnkles. For the moment nothing happens. But Gustave the friend has for\r\nmistress an adorable _grisette_--amiability, in the widest sense, _nez\r\nretroussé_, garret, and millinery all complete--whom Madame de Péreux,\r\nEdmond's mother--a _sainte_, but without prejudices--tolerates, and in\r\nfact patronises. It is arranged that Nichette shall call on Antonine to\r\nask, as a milliner, for her custom. Quite unexpected explanations follow\r\nin a not uningenious manner, and the explosion is completed by Edmond's\r\nopening (not at all treacherously) a letter addressed to Gustave and\r\ncontaining the news of his own danger. The rest of the story need not be\r\ntold at length. A miraculous cure effected by M. Devaux, Antonine's\r\nfather; marriage of the pair; pensioning off of Nichette, and marriage\r\nof Gustave to another adorable girl (ankles not here specified);\r\nestablishment of Nichette at Tours in partnership with a respectable\r\nfriend, etc., etc., can easily be supplied by any novel-reader.\r\n\r\nBut here the young author's nascent seriousness, and his still existing\r\nBuskbody superstition, combine to spoil the book, not merely, as in the\r\n_Tristan_ case, to top-hamper it. Having given us eight pages of rather\r\ncheap sermonising about the poetry of youth not lasting; having\r\nrequested us to imagine Manon and Des Grieux \"decrepit and catarrhous,\"\r\nPaul and Virginie shrivelled and toothless, Werther and Charlotte united\r\nbut wrinkled,[368] he proceeds to tell us how, though Gustave and his\r\nLaurence are as happy as they can be, though Nichette has forgotten her\r\nwoes but kept her income and is married to a book-seller, things are not\r\nwell with the other pair. Antonine loves her husband frantically, but he\r\nhas become quite indifferent to her--says, indeed, that he really does\r\nnot know whether he ever _did_ love her. Later still we take leave of\r\nhim, his \"poetry\" having ended in a prefecture, and his passion in a\r\n_liaison_, commonplace to the _n_th, with a provincial lawyer's wife.\r\n_La moralité de cette comédie_ (to quote, probably not for the first\r\ntime, or I hope the last, words of Musset which I particularly like)\r\nwould appear to be--first, that to secure lasting happiness in matrimony\r\nit is desirable, if not necessary, to have lived for eighteen months\r\nantenuptially with a charming _grisette_--amiability, _nez retroussé_,\r\ngarret, and millinery all complete--_or_ to have yourself been this\r\ngrisette; while, on the other hand, it is an extremely dangerous thing\r\nto recover a man of his consumption. Which last result the folklorists\r\nwould doubtless assimilate to the well-known superstition of the shore\r\nas to the rescue of the drowning.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Vie à Vingt Ans._]\r\n\r\nTwo other early books of this author promise the Pauline influence in\r\ntheir titles and do not belie it in their contents, though in varying\r\nway and degree. Indeed, the first story of _La Vie à Vingt Ans_--that of\r\na schoolboy who breaks his bounds and \"sells his dictionaries\" to go to\r\nthe Bal de l'Opéra; receives, half in joy, half in terror, an\r\nassignation from a masked _débardeur_, and discovers her to be an aged\r\nmarried woman with a drunken husband (the pair knowing from his card\r\nthat his uncle is a Deputy, and having determined to get a _débit de\r\ntabac_ out of him)--made me laugh as heartily as the great Paul himself\r\ncan ever have made Major Pendennis. The rest--they are all stories of\r\nthe various amatory experiences of a certain Emmanuel de Trois Étoiles,\r\nand have a virtuous epilogue extolling pure affection and honest\r\nmatrimony--are inferior, the least so being that of the caprice-love of\r\na certain Augustine, Emmanuel's neighbour on his staircase, who admits\r\nonly one other lover and finally marries _him_, but conceives a frantic\r\nthough passing affection for her _voisin_. Unluckily there is in this\r\nbook a sort of duplicate but, I think, earlier sketch of the atrocious\r\nconduct of Duval to the Dame aux Camélias; and there are some of the\r\nauthor's curious \"holes where you can put your hand\" (as a Jacobean poet\r\nsays of the prosodic licences in nomenclature and construction of his\r\nfellows).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Aventures de Quatre Femmes._]\r\n\r\nThe other, much longer, and much more ambitious and elaborate book,\r\n_Aventures de Quatre Femmes et d'un Perroquet_, seems to me on the whole\r\nworse than any just mentioned, though it at least attempts to fly higher\r\nthan _Antonine_. It begins by one of those _goguenardises_ which 1830\r\nitself had loved, but it is not a good specimen. Two men who have\r\ndetermined on suicide--one by shooting, one by hanging--meet at the same\r\ntree in the Bois de Boulogne and wrangle about possession of the spot,\r\ntill the aspirant to suspension _per coll._ recounts his history from\r\nthe branch on which he is perched. After which an unlucky thirdsman,\r\ninterfering, gets shot, and buried _as_ one of the others--\"which is\r\nwitty, let us 'ope,\" as the poetical historian of the quarrel between\r\nMr. Swinburne and Mr. Buchanan observes of something else.[369] As the\r\nbook begins with two attempted and disappointed suicides, so it ends\r\nwith two accomplished ones. A great part, and not the least readable, is\r\noccupied by a certain English Countess of Lindsay (for Dumas the\r\nyounger, like Crébillon the younger, commits these _scandala magnatum_\r\nwith actual titles). The hero is rather a fool, and not much less of a\r\nknave than he should be. His somewhat better wife is an innocent\r\nbigamist, thinking him dead; and one of the end-suicides is that of her\r\nsecond husband, who, finding himself _de trop_, benevolently makes way.\r\nAs for the parrot, he nearly spoils the story at the beginning by\r\n\"_singing_\" (which I never heard a parrot do), and atones at the end by\r\ngetting poisoned without deserving it. I am afraid I must call it a\r\nrather silly book.\r\n\r\nIt does not, however, lack the cleverness with which silliness,\r\nespecially in the young _and_ the old, is often associated, and so does\r\nnot break the assignment of that quality to its author. All these five\r\nbooks were produced (with others) in a very few years, by a man who was\r\nscarcely over twenty when he began and was not thirty when he wrote the\r\nlast of them. Now people sometimes write wonderful poetry when they are\r\nvery young, because, after all, a poet is not much more than a\r\nmouthpiece of the Divine, whose spirit bloweth where it listeth. But it\r\nis not often that they write thoroughly good novels till, like other\r\npersonages who have to wait for their \"overseership\" up to thirty, they\r\nhave had time and opportunity roughly to scan and sample life. There is,\r\nin this work of Alexander the younger, plenty of imitation, of\r\nconvention, of that would-be knowingness which is the most amusing form\r\nof ignorance, etc., etc. But there is a good deal more: and especially\r\nthere is plenty of the famous _diable au corps_, of _verve_, of \"go,\" of\r\nrefusal to be content with one rut and one model. And all this came\r\nonce, even at this period, in _La Dame aux Camélias_, to something which\r\nI shall not call a masterpiece, but which certainly is a powerful thesis\r\nfor the attainment of the master's degree.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Trois Hommes Forts._]\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no better example of the curious mixture of _verve_,\r\nvariety, and vigorous hitting-off which characterised the youth of Dumas\r\n_fils_ than _Trois Hommes Forts_--a book of the exact middle of the\r\ncentury, which begins with an idyll, passing into a tragedy; continues\r\nwith a lively ship-and-yellow-fever scene; plunges into a villainous\r\nconspiracy against virtue and innocence diversified with a\r\nbull-throwing; and winds up with another killing, which, this time, _is_\r\nno murder; a trial, after which and an acquittal the accused and the\r\nCrown Prosecutor embrace before (and amidst the chalorous applause of)\r\nthe whole Court; not forgetting a final _panache_ of happy\r\nmarriage between innocence, a very little damaged, and the\r\nbull-thrower-avenger-_ouvrier_, Robert. It is of course pure\r\nmelodrama--_Minnigrey_ and the Porte-Saint-Martin pleasantly\r\naccommodated. But it is not too long; it never drags; and it knocks\r\nabout in the cheerfullest \"pit-box-and-gallery\" fashion from first to\r\nlast. When the wicked \"Joseph le Mendiant,\" _alias_ M. Valéry, _alias_\r\nFrédéric Comte de La Marche[370]--who has stabbed a priest with one hand\r\nand throttled an old woman with the other; then made a fortune in\r\nMadagascar; then nearly died of yellow-fever on board ship, but\r\nrecovered (something after the fashion of one of Marryat's heroes) by\r\ndrinking a bottle of Madeira; then gone home and bought an estate and\r\ngiven himself the above title; then seduced the innocent sister of the\r\nperson who heard his confession; then tried to marry a high-born\r\nmaiden;[371] then threatened to betray the sister's shame if her\r\nbrother \"tells\"--when this villain has his skull broken by Robert, all\r\nright-minded persons will clap their hands sore. But remembrance of one\r\npassage at the beginning may \"leave a savour of sorrow.\" Could you, even\r\nin Meridional France, to-day procure a breakfast consisting of truffled\r\npigs' feet, truffled thrush, tomato omelette (I should bar the\r\ntomatoes), and strawberries in summer, or \"quatre-mendiants\" (figs,\r\nnuts, and almonds and raisins) in winter, _with_ a bottle of sound\r\nRoussillon or something like it, for three francs? Alas! one fears not.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Diane de Lys._]\r\n\r\n_Diane de Lys_, a little later than most of the books just mentioned,\r\nand one, I think, of the first to be dramatised, so announcing the\r\nauthor's change of \"kind,\" acquired a certain fame by being made (in\r\nwhich form I am not certain, but probably as a play) the subject of one\r\nof those odd \"condemnations\" by which the Second Empire occasionally\r\nendeavoured to show itself the defender of morality and the prop of\r\nfamily and social life. I do not think that Flaubert and Baudelaire had\r\nmuch reason to pride themselves on their predecessor in this particular\r\npillory. Alexander the younger is not here even a coppersmith; his metal\r\nis, to me, not attractive at all. The Marquise de Lys is one of those\r\nbeauties, half Greek, half Madonnish, and wholly regular-scholastic, to\r\nwhom it has been the habit of modern novelists and poets to assign what\r\nour Elizabethan ancestors would have called \"cold hearts and hot\r\nlivers.\" Dumas _fils'_ theory--for he must, Heaven help him! always have\r\none[372]--is that it all depends on ennui. I know not. At any rate,\r\nDiane is not a heroine that I should recommend, for personal\r\nacquaintance, to myself or my friends. With one of those rather silly\r\nexcuses which chequer his cleverness equally, whether they are made\r\nhonestly or with tongue in cheek, our author says: \"On va sans doute\r\nnous dire que nous présentons un caractère impossible, que nous faisons\r\nde l'immoralité\" (which the compositors of the stereotyped edition\r\npleasantly misprint \"immor_t_alité\"), etc. Far be it from me to say that\r\nany woman is impossible. I would only observe that when Diane, neglected\r\nby and neglecting her husband for some two years, determines to take a\r\nlover, being vexed at the idea of reaching the age of thirty without\r\nhaving one; when she takes him without any particular preference, as one\r\nmight call a cab from a longish rank, and then has a fancy to make a\r\nscientific comparison of forgotten joys with her husband, deciding\r\nfinally that there is nothing like alternation--when, I say, she does\r\nthis, I think she is not quite nice.[373] Nor does her school-friend\r\nMarceline Delaunay--who, being herself a married woman irreproachably\r\nfaithful to her own husband, makes herself a go-between, at least of\r\nletters, for Diane--seem very nice either. It is fair to say that Mme.\r\nDelaunay gets punished in the latter part of the story, which any one\r\nmay read who likes. It is, if not white, a sort of--what shall we\r\nsay?--French grey, compared with the opening.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shorter stories--_Une Loge à Camille_.]\r\n\r\nThat standard edition of _Diane de Lys_ which has enabled us to pick up\r\nsuch a pleasant _coquille d'imprimerie_ contains three shorter stories\r\n(_Diane_ itself is not very long). Two or them are not worth much: _Ce\r\nqu'on ne sait pas_ is a pathetic _grisetterie_, something of the class\r\nof Musset's _Frédéric et Bernerette_; _Grangette_ deals with the very\r\ntrue but very common admonition that in being \"on with\" two loves at\r\nonce there is always danger, particularly when, as M. le Baron Francis\r\nde Maucroix does here, you write them letters (to save time) in exactly\r\nthe same phraseology. Neither love, Adeline the countess or the\r\nGris-Grang-ette, is disagreeable; indeed Francis himself is a not\r\ndetestable idiot, and there is a comfortable conversation as he sits at\r\nAdeline's feet in proper morning-call costume, with his hat and stick\r\non a chair. (Even kneeling would surely be less dangerous, from the\r\npoint of view of recovering a more usual attitude when another caller\r\ncomes.) But the whole thing is slight. The third and last, however, _Une\r\nLoge à Camille_, is the only thing in the whole volume that is\r\nthoroughly recommendable. It begins with an obviously \"felt\" and \"lived\"\r\ncomplaint of the woes which dramatic authors perhaps most of all, but\r\nothers more or less, experience from that extraordinary\r\ninconsecutiveness (to put it mildly) of their acquaintances which makes\r\npeople--who, to do them justice, would hardly ask for five, ten, or\r\nfifty shillings except as a loan, with at least pretence of\r\nrepayment--demand almost, or quite, as a right, a box at the theatre or\r\na copy of a book. This finished, an example is given in which the\r\nhapless playwright, having rashly obliged a friend, becomes (very much\r\nin the same way in which Mr. Nicodemus Easy killed several persons on\r\nthe coast of Sicily) responsible for the breach, not merely of a\r\nleft-handed yet comparatively harmless _liaison_, but of a formal\r\nmarriage, the knitting of a costly and disreputable amour, a duel, an\r\nimprisonment for debt, and--for himself--the abiding reputation of\r\nhaving corrupted, half ruined, and driven into enlistment for Africa a\r\nguileless scientific student. It is good and clean fun throughout.[374]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Docteur Servans._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Roman d'une Femme_.]\r\n\r\nSome others must have shorter shrift. One volume of the standard edition\r\ncontains two stories, _Le Docteur Servans_ and _Un Cas de Rupture_. The\r\nlatter is short and not very happy, beginning with a rather feeble\r\nfollowing of Xavier de Maistre,[375] continuing with stock\r\n_liaison_-matter, and ending rather vulgarly. Let us, however, give\r\nthanks to Alexander the younger in that he nobly defends the sacred\r\npersons of our English ladies against the venerable Gallic calumny of\r\nlarge feet, though he unhappily shows imperfect knowledge of the idioms\r\nof our language by using \"Lady\" as if it were like \"Milady\": \"Reprit\r\nLady,\" \"Lady vit,\" etc. _Le Docteur Servans_ is more substantial, though\r\nitself not very long. It is a rather well-engineered story (illustrative\r\nof a fact to be noticed presently in regard to much of its author's\r\nwork) about a benevolent doctor who, at first as a method of kindness\r\nand then as a method of testing character, \"makes believe,\" and makes\r\nothers believe, that he has the secret of Resurrection.[376] On the\r\nother hand, I have only read _Le Roman d'une Femme_ in the beloved\r\nlittle old Belgian edition which gave one one's first knowledge of so\r\nmany pleasant things, and the light-weighting and large print of which\r\nare specially suitable to fiction. Putting one thing aside, it is not\r\none of its author's greatest triumphs. It begins with a good deal of\r\nthat rather nauseous gush about the adorable candour of young persons\r\nwhich, in a French novel, too often means that the \"blanche colombe\"\r\nwill become a very dingy dunghill hen before long--as duly happens here.\r\nThere is, however, a chance for the novel reader of comparing the\r\ndeparture of two of these white doves[377] from their school-dovecot\r\nwith that of Becky and Amelia from Miss Pinkerton's. And I must admit\r\nthat, after a middle of commonplace grime, the author works up an end of\r\ncomplicated and by no means unreal tragedy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The habit of quickening up at the end.]\r\n\r\nThe point referred to about the two principal books just noticed, and\r\nindeed about Alexander the Younger's books generally, is the remarkable\r\nfaculty--and not merely faculty but actual habit--which he displays, of\r\nturning an uninteresting beginning into an interesting end. I cannot\r\nremember any other novelist, in any of the literatures with which I am\r\nacquainted, who possesses, or at least uses, this odd gift to anything\r\nlike the same degree. On the contrary, some of the greatest--far greater\r\nthan he is--give results exactly contrary. Lady Louisa Stuart's reproach\r\nto Scott for \"huddling up\" his conclusions is well known and by no means\r\nill-justified, while Sir Walter is far from being a solitary sinner. I\r\nmust leave it to those who have given more study than I have to drama,\r\nespecially modern drama, to decide whether this had anything to do with\r\nthe fact that Dumas turned to the other kind. The main fact itself\r\nadmits, as far as my experience and opinion go, of absolutely no\r\ndispute. Again and again, not merely in _Le Docteur Servans_ and _Le\r\nRoman d'une Femme_, but in _La Dame aux Camélias_ itself, in _Tristan le\r\nRoux_, in _Les Aventures de Quatre Femmes_, and in others still, I have\r\nbeen, at first reading, on the point of dropping the book. But, owing to\r\nthe mere \"triarian\" habit of never giving up an appointed post, I have\r\nbeen able to turn my defeat (and his, as it seemed to me) into a\r\nvictory, which no doubt I owe to him, but which has something of my own\r\nin it too. His heroes very frequently disgust and his heroines do not\r\noften delight me; I have \"seen many others\" than his baits of\r\nvoluptuousness; he does not amuse me like Crébillon; nor thrill me like\r\nPrévost in the unique moment; nor interest me like his closest\r\nsuccessor, Feuillet. I cannot place his work, despite the excellence of\r\nhis mere writing, high as great literature. He is altogether on a lower\r\nlevel than Flaubert or Maupassant; and one could not think of evening\r\nhim with Hugo in one way, with Balzac in another, with his own father in\r\na third, with Gautier or Mérimée in a fourth. But he does, somehow or\r\nother, manage that, in the evening time, there shall be such light as he\r\ncan give; and I am bound to acknowledge this as a triumph of craft, if\r\nnot of actual art. That while a gift and a remarkable one, it is rather\r\na dangerous gift for a novelist to rely on, needs little argument.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Contes et Nouvelles._]\r\n\r\nThe formally titled _Contes et Nouvelles_ do not contain very much of\r\nthe first interest. In the opening one there is a lady who, not perhaps\r\nin the context quite tastefully, remarks that \"Nous avons toutes notre\r\ncalvaire,\" her own Golgotha consisting of the duty of adjusting \"the\r\nextremist devotion\" to her husband with \"remembrance\" (there was a good\r\ndeal to remember) of her lover \"to her last heart-beat.\" To help her to\r\nperform this self-immolation, she bids the lover leave her, refuses him,\r\nand that repeatedly, permission to return, till, believing himself\r\nutterly cast off, he makes up his mind to love a very nice girl whom his\r\nparents want him to marry. _Then_ the self-Calvarised lady promptly\r\ndiscovers that she wants him again; and as he, acknowledging her claim,\r\ndoes not disguise his actual state of feeling, she, though going off in\r\na huff, tells him that she had never meant him either to leave her at\r\nfirst or to accept her command not to return. All this, no doubt, is not\r\nunfeminine in the abstract; but the concrete telling of it required more\r\ninteresting personages. _Le Prix de Pigeons_ is a good-humoured\r\nabsurdity about an English scientific society, which offers a prize of\r\n£2000 to anybody who can eat a pigeon every day for a month; _Le Pendu\r\nde la Piroche_, a fifteenth-century anecdote, which may be a sort of\r\n_brouillon_ for _Tristan_; _Césarine_, a fortune-telling tale. But _La\r\nBoîte d'Argent_, the story of a man who got rid of his heart and found\r\nhimself none the better for getting it back again (the circumstances in\r\neach case being quite different from those of _Das kalte Herz_), and _Ce\r\nque l'on voit tous les jours_, a sketch of \"scenes\" between keeper and\r\nmistress, but of much wider application, go far above the rest of the\r\nbook. The first (which is of considerable length and very cleverly\r\nmanaged in the change from ordinary to extraordinary) only wants \"that\"\r\nto be first-rate. The second shows in the novelist the command of\r\ndialogue-situation and of dialogue itself which was afterwards to stand\r\nthe playwright in such good stead.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Ilka._]\r\n\r\nSome forty years afterwards--indeed I think posthumously--another\r\ncollection appeared, with, for main title, that of its first story,\r\n_Ilka_. Subject to the caution, several times already given, of the\r\ninadequacy of a foreigner's judgment, I should say that it shows a great\r\nimprovement in mere style, but somewhat of a falling off in originality\r\nand _verve_. The most interesting thing, perhaps, is an anecdote of the\r\nauthor's youth, when, having in the midst of a revolution extracted the\r\nmighty sum of two hundred francs in one bank-note from a publisher for a\r\nbad novel (he does not tell us which), he gives it to a porter to\r\nchange, and the messenger being delayed, entertains the direst\r\nsuspicions (which turn out to be quite unjust) of the poor fellow's\r\nhonesty. The sketch of mood is capitally done, and is set off by a most\r\npleasant introduction of Dumas _père_. More ambitious but less\r\nsuccessful, except as mere descriptive _ecphrases_,[378] are the\r\ntitle-story of a beautiful model posing, and _Le Songe d'une Nuit\r\nd'Été_, with a companion picture of two lovers bathing at night; _Pile\r\nou Face_ (a girl who is so divided between two lovers that a friend\r\nadvises her to toss up, with the pessimist-satiric addition that no\r\ndoubt, between tossing and marriage, she will be sorry she did not take\r\nthe other, but afterwards will forget all about him) is slighter; and\r\n_Au Docteur J. P._ looks like a kind of study for a longer novel or at\r\nleast a more elaborate novel-hero.[379]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Affaire Clémenceau._]\r\n\r\nAnd so, at last, we may come to the book which curiously carries out,\r\nwith a slight deflection, but an almost equivalent intensification, of\r\nmeaning, what has been observed before of others--the singular habit\r\nwhich Dumas _fils_ has of quickening up for the run-in. This book was,\r\nI believe, in all important respects actually his run-in for the\r\nnovel-prize; and what he had hitherto shown in the conduct of individual\r\nbooks he now showed in regard to his whole novel-list, betaking himself\r\nthenceforward, though he had nearly a third of a century to live, to the\r\ntheatre, to pamphlets, etc. Against _Affaire Clémenceau_[380] there are\r\nsome things to be said, and in criticism, not necessarily hostile, a\r\ngreat many about it. But nobody who knows strength when he sees it can\r\ndeny that this is a strong book from start to finish. I can very well\r\nremember the hubbub it caused when it first appeared, and the debates\r\nabout \"Tue-la!\" but I did not then read it, having, as I have confessed,\r\na sort of prejudice--not then or at any time common with me--against the\r\nauthor--a prejudice strengthened rather than weakened by reviews of the\r\nbook. What did I care (I am bound to say that I might add, \"What _do_ I\r\ncare?\") about discussions whether if somebody breaks the Seventh\r\nCommandment to your discomfort you may break the Sixth to theirs? Did I\r\nwant diatribes on the non-moral character of women, or anything of that\r\nsort? I wanted an interesting story; an attractive (no matter in what\r\nfashion) heroine; a hero who is a gentleman, if possible, a man anyhow;\r\nand I did not think I should find them here. _Now_, I can \"dichotomise\"\r\nto some extent; and I can get an interesting story, striking moments, if\r\nnot exactly an attractive heroine or hero, at any rate such as take\r\ntheir part in the interest, though I may have crows to pluck with them.\r\nIt is, once more, a strong book: it is nearly--though I do not think\r\nquite--a great book. And to all sportsmanlike lovers of letters it is,\r\ndespite its discomfortable matter, a comfortable book, because it shows\r\nus a considerable man of letters who has never yet, save perhaps in _La\r\nDame aux Camélias_, quite \"come off,\" coming off beyond all fair doubt\r\nor reasonable question.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Story of it.]\r\n\r\nProbably a good many people know the story of it, but certainly some do\r\nnot. It can be told pretty shortly. Pierre Clémenceau, the _fils\r\nnaturel_ (for this _vulnus_ is _eternum_) of a linen-draperess, is made,\r\npartly on account of his birth, unhappy at school, being especially\r\ntormented by an American-Italian boy, André Minati, whom, however, he\r\nthrashes, and who dies--but not of the thrashing. The father of another\r\nand _not_ hostile school-fellow, Constantin Ritz, is a sculptor, and\r\naccident helps him to discover the same vocation in young Clémenceau,\r\nwho is taken into his protector's household as well as his studio, and\r\nmakes great progress in his art--the one thing he cares for. He goes,\r\nhowever, a very little into society, and one evening meets a remarkable\r\nRussian-Polish Countess, whose train (for it is a kind of fancy ball) is\r\nborne by her thirteen-year-old daughter Iza, dressed as a page. The girl\r\nis extraordinarily beautiful, and Clémenceau, whose heart is practically\r\nvirgin, falls in love with her, child as she is; improving the\r\nacquaintance by making a drawing of her when asleep, as well as later a\r\nbust from actual sittings, _gratis_. After a time, however, the\r\nCountess, who has some actual and more sham \"claims\" in Poland and\r\nRussia, returns thither. Years pass, during which, however, Pierre hears\r\nnow and then from Iza in a mixed strain of love and friendship, till at\r\nlast he is stung doubly, by news that she is to marry a young Russian\r\nnoble named Serge, and by a commission for the trousseau to be supplied\r\nby his mother,[381] who has retired from business. The correspondence\r\nchanges to sharp reproach on his part and apparently surprised\r\nresentment on hers. But before long she appears in person (the Serge\r\nmarriage having fallen through), and, to speak vernacularly, throws\r\nherself straight at Pierre's head, even offering to be his mistress if\r\nshe cannot be his wife.[382] They are married, however, and spend not\r\nmerely a honeymoon, but nearly a honey-year in what is, in _Hereward the\r\nWake_, graciously called \"sweet madness,\" the madness, however, being\r\npurely physical, though so far genuine, on her side, spiritual as well\r\nas physical on his. The central scene of the book (very well done) gives\r\na picture of Iza insisting on bathing in a stream running through the\r\npark (private, but practically open to the public) of the house lent to\r\nthem. When her husband has brought her warm milk in a chased-silver cup\r\nof their host's, she casts it, empty, on the ground, and on the\r\nhusband's exclamation, \"Take care!\" replies coolly, \"What does it\r\nmatter? It isn't _mine_.\"\r\n\r\nThis may be said to be the third warning-bell; but though it shocks even\r\nthe \"ensorceressed\" Pierre for the moment, his infatuation continues. At\r\nlast he begins to have an idea that people look askance at him; trains\r\nof suspicion are laid; after one or two clever evasions of Iza's, the\r\nusual \"epistolary communication\" forces the matter, and Constantin Ritz\r\nat last tells the unhappy husband that not merely has \"Serge\"\r\nreappeared, but there are nearly half-a-dozen \"others,\" and that doubts\r\nhave even been suggested as to connivance on Pierre's part--doubts\r\nstrengthened by Iza's treacherous complaints as to her husband having\r\nemployed her as a model. A violent scene follows, Iza brazening it out,\r\nand calmly demanding separation. Clémenceau goes to Rome after forcing a\r\nduel on Serge and wounding him; but the blow has weakened, if not\r\ndestroyed, his powers in art. Fresh scandals follow, and the\r\nirresistible Iza seduces Constantin himself, characteristically\r\ncommunicating the fact in an anonymous letter to her miserable husband.\r\nHe returns (for the second time), takes no vengeance on his friend, but\r\nsees his wife. The interview provides an audaciously devised but finely\r\nexecuted curtain. She calmly proposes--how shall we say it?--to \"put\r\nherself in commission.\" She loves nobody but him, she says, and knows he\r\nhas loved, loves, and will love nobody but her. He ought, originally,\r\nto have taken her offer of being his mistress, and then no harm would\r\nhave happened. She would really like to go back with him to Saint-Assise\r\n(the honeymoon place). Suppose they do? As for _living_ with him and\r\nbeing \"faithful\" to him--that is impossible. But she will come to him,\r\nat his whistle, whenever he likes, and be absolutely his for a day and a\r\nnight and a morrow. In fact he may begin at once if he likes: and she\r\nputs her arms round his neck and her mouth to his. He takes her at her\r\nword; but when the night is half passed and she is asleep, he gently\r\nrises, goes into the next room, fetches a stiletto paper-knife with\r\nwhich he has seen her playing, half wakes her, asks her if she loves\r\nhim, to which, still barely conscious, she answers \"Yes!\" with a\r\nhalf-formed kiss on her lips. Then he stabs her dead with a single blow,\r\nleaving the house quietly, and giving himself up to the police at dawn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticism of it and of its author's work generally.]\r\n\r\nIf anybody asks me, \"Is this well done?\" expecting me to enter on the\r\ndiscussion of the _lex non scripta_, I shall reply that this is not my\r\ntrade. But if the question refers to the merits of the handling, I can\r\nreply as confidently as the dying Charmian, \"It is well done, and\r\nfitting for a novelist.\" In no book, as it seems to me, has the author\r\nobtained such a complete command of his subject or reeled out his story\r\nwith such steady confidence and fluency. No doubt he sometimes preaches\r\ntoo much.[383] The elder Ritz's advice against suicide, for instance, if\r\nsound is superfluous. But this is not a very serious evil, and the\r\nsteady _crescendo_ of interest which prevails throughout the story\r\ncarries it off. There are also numerous separate passages of real\r\ndistinction, the fateful bathing-scene being, as it should be, the best,\r\nexcept the finale; but others, such as the history of Pierre's first\r\nmodelling from the life, being excellent. The satire on the literary\r\ncoteries of the Restoration is about the best thing of the kind that the\r\nauthor has done; and many of the \"interiors\"--always a strong point with\r\nhim--are admirable. It is on the point of character that the chief\r\nquestions may arise; but here also there seems to me to be only one of\r\nthese--it is true it is the most important of all--on which there should\r\nbe much debate. The succumbing of Constantin seems perhaps a little more\r\njustifiable by its importance to the story than by its intrinsic\r\nprobability.[384] Clémenceau seems to me \"constant to himself,\" or in\r\nthe \"good childlikeness\" of his character, throughout; and to ask\r\nwhether it was necessary to make him smash the bust that he finds in\r\nSerge's possession seems to be equivalent to asking whether it was\r\nnecessary to put the Vice-Consul of Tetuan in petticoats.[385] It is\r\nonly about Iza herself that there can be much dispute. Has that process\r\nsynthetic which is spoken of elsewhere been carried too far with her?\r\nHave doses of childlikeness, beauty, charm, ill-nature, sensual\r\nappetite, etc., been taken too \"boldly\" (in technical doctors' sense)\r\nand mixed too crudely to measure? A word or two may be permissible on\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nI do not think that Iza is an impossible personage; nor do I think that\r\nshe is even an improbable one to such an extent as to bar her out,\r\npossible or impossible. But I am not sure that she is not rather\r\narbitrarily synthetised instead of being re-created, or that she, though\r\npossible and not quite improbable, is not singly abnormal[386] to the\r\nverge of monstrosity. It must be evident to any reader of tolerable\r\nacuteness that the obsession of _Manon Lescaut_ has not left Dumas\r\n_fils_. Although the total effect of Manon and of Iza is very different,\r\nand although they are differently \"staged,\" their resemblances in\r\ndetail are very great; and, to speak paradoxically, the differences are\r\nalmost more resembling still. Iza offers herself as mistress if there\r\nare any difficulties in the way of her being a wife; would, in fact, as\r\nshe admits long afterwards, have preferred the less honourable, but also\r\nless fettering, estate. On the other hand, be it remembered, it was\r\nsomething of an accident that Manon and Des Grieux were _not_ actually\r\nmarried. The two women are alike in their absolute insistence on luxury\r\nand pleasure before anything else; but they differ in that Iza does--as\r\nwe said Manon did _not_, or did not specially--want \"what Messalina\r\nwanted.\" On the other hand, Iza is ill-natured and Manon is not. In\r\nthese respects we may say that the Manon-formula has passed through that\r\nof Madame de Merteuil, and bears unpleasant signs of the passage. Manon\r\nrepents, which Iza never could do. But they agree in the courtesan\r\nessence--the readiness to exchange for other things that commodity of\r\ntheirs which should be given only for love. I never wish to supply my\r\nreaders with problem-tabloids; but I think that in this paragraph I have\r\nsupplied them with materials for working out the double question, \"Is\r\nIza less human than Manon? and if so, why?\" for themselves, as well as,\r\nif by any chance they should care to do so, of guessing my own answers\r\nto it.[387]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reflections.]\r\n\r\nIt is more germane to custom and purpose here to add a few general\r\nremarks on the story, and more, but still few, on its author's general\r\nposition. _Affaire Clémenceau_ is certainly, as has been said before,\r\nhis strongest book, and, especially if taken together with _La Dame aux\r\nCamélias_ (which, if less free from faults, contains some different\r\nmerits), it constitutes a strong thesis or diploma-piece for all but the\r\nhighest degree as a novelist. Taking in the others which have been\r\nsurveyed, we must also acknowledge in the author an unusually wide range\r\nand a great display of faculty--even of faculties--almost all over that\r\nrange, though perhaps in no other case than the two selected has he\r\nthoroughly mastered and firmly held the ground which he has attempted to\r\nwin. If he has not--if _Tristan le Roux_ is, on the whole, only a\r\nsecond- or third-rate historical romance; _Trois Hommes Forts_ a fair\r\nand competent, but not thrilling melodrama, and so on, and so on--it is\r\nno doubt partly, to speak with the sometimes useful as well as engaging\r\nirrationality of childhood, \"because he couldn't.\" But I think it is\r\nalso because of something that can be explained. It was because he was\r\nfar too prone to theorise about men and women and to make his books\r\nattempted demonstrations, or at least illustrations, of his theories.\r\nNow, to theorise about men is seldom very satisfactory; but to theorise\r\nabout women is to weigh gossamer and measure moonbeams. The very wisest\r\nthing ever said about them is said in the old English couplet:\r\n\r\n    Some be lewd, and some be shrewd,\r\n        _But all they be not so_,\r\n\r\nand I think that our fifteenth- or early sixteenth-century _vates_\r\nshowed his wisdom most in sticking to the strict negative in his\r\nexculpatory second line, here italicised.\r\n\r\nNow if Alexander the Younger does not absolutely insist that \"all they\r\n_be_ so,\" he goes very near to it, excepting only characters of\r\ninsignificant domesticity. When he does give you an \"honnête femme\" who\r\nis not merely this, such as the Clémentine of the _Roman d'une Femme_ or\r\nthe Marceline of _Diane de Lys_, he gives them some queer touches. His\r\n\"_shady_ Magdalenes\" (with apologies to one of the best of parodies for\r\nspoiling its double rhyme) and his even more shady, because more\r\ninexcusable, _marquises_; his adorable innocents, who let their\r\ninnocence vanish \"in the heat of the moment\" (as the late Mr. Samuel\r\nMorley said when he forgot that Mr. Bradlaugh was an atheist), because\r\nthe husbands pay too much attention to politics; and his affectionate\r\nwives, like the Lady in _Thérèse_,[388] who supply their missing\r\nhusbands' place just for once, and forget all about it--these _might_ be\r\nindividually creatures of fact, but as a class they _are_ creatures of\r\ntheory. And theory never made a good novel yet: it is lucky if it has\r\nsometimes, but too rarely, failed to make a good into a bad one. But it\r\nhas been urged--and with some truth as regards at least the later forms\r\nof the French novel--that it is almost founded on theory, and certainly\r\nDumas _fils_ can be cited in support--perhaps, indeed, he is the first\r\nimportant and thoroughgoing supporter. And this of itself justifies the\r\nplace and the kind of treatment allotted to him here, the justification\r\nbeing strengthened by the fact that he, after Beyle, and when Beyle's\r\ninfluence was still little felt, was a leader of a new class of\r\nnovelist, that he is the first novelist definitely of the Second Empire.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[349] As, for instance, in _A Short History of French Literature_\r\n(Oxford, 7th ed., 1917), pp. 550-552.\r\n\r\n[350] At the same time, and admitting (see below) that it is wrong to\r\nmeet overpraise with overblame, I think that it may be met with silence,\r\nfor the time at any rate.\r\n\r\n[351] I have, for reasons unnecessary to particularise, not observed\r\nstrict chronological order in noticing his work or that of some others;\r\nbut a sufficient \"control\" will, I hope, be supplied by the Appendix of\r\ndated books under their authors' names as treated in this volume.\r\n\r\n[352] I observe with amusement (which may or may not be shared by \"the\r\nfriends of Mr. Peter Magnus\") that I have repeated in the case of Dumas\r\n_fils_ what I said on Crébillon _fils_. The contrast-parallel is indeed\r\nrather striking. Partly it is a case of reversal, for Crébillon _père_\r\nwas a most respectable man, most serious, and an academician; the son,\r\nthough not personally disreputable, was the very reverse of serious, and\r\nacademic neither by nature nor by status. In Dumas' case the father was\r\nextremely lively, and the Academy shuddered or sneered at him; the son\r\nwas very serious indeed, and duly academised. Some surprise was, I\r\nremember, occasioned at the time by this promotion. There are several\r\nexplanations of it; mine is Alexander the son's fondness for the correct\r\nsubjunctive. George Sand, in a note to one of her books (I forget\r\nwhich), rebelliously says that the speaker in the text _ought_ to have\r\nsaid, \"aimasse,\" not \"aimais,\" but that he didn't, and she will not make\r\nhim do it. On the other hand, I find \"aimasse,\" \"haïsse,\" and \"revisse\"\r\nin just three lines of _La Dame aux Camélias_. And everybody ought to\r\nknow the story of the Immortal who, upon finding a man \"where nae mon\r\nshould be,\" and upon that \"mon\" showing the baseness derived from Adam\r\nby turning on his accomplice and saying, \"Quand je vous disais qu'il\r\nétait temps que je m'en aille!\" neglected _crim. con._ for _crim. gram._\r\nand cried in horror, \"Que je m'en all_asse_, Monsieur!\" But this\r\npreciseness did not extend to the younger Alexander's choice of\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n[353]\r\n\r\n     To whose \"music\" also our young friends,\r\n     As they tell us, have \"lost the key.\"\r\n\r\n[354] Dumas, like other mid-nineteenth century novelists in France and\r\nEngland both, is perhaps too fond of this complaint. But, after all, it\r\n_does_ \"stage\" more prettily than appendicitis or typhoid.\r\n\r\n[355] Nor is this the only place where _Manon_ figures in the work of\r\nAlexander the younger. Especially in the early books direct references,\r\nmore or less obvious, are frequent; and, as will be seen, the\r\ninspiration reappears in his best and almost last novel.\r\n\r\n[356] It may perhaps seem to some readers that Janin's own novel-work\r\nshould have been noticed earlier. I had at one time thought of doing\r\nthis. But his most famous book of the sort, _L'Âne Mort et la Femme\r\nGuillotinée_, is a foolish _fatrasie_ of extravagant, undigested,\r\nunaffecting horrors, from the devouring by dogs of the _live_ donkey, at\r\nthe beginning, to the \"resurrectioning\" of the guillotined woman, at the\r\nend. Sterne has played tricks with many clumsy imitators, but with none\r\nto more destructive effect than in this case. I read it first in the\r\nflush of my early enthusiasm for 1830, and was miserably disappointed; I\r\ntried to read it again the other day, and simply broke down. _Barnave_\r\nis interesting only as referred to by Gautier; and so on. The fact is\r\nthat \"J. J.\" was \"J. J. _J._\"--a journalist merely--with a not\r\nunpleasant frothy ginger-beery style, but with nothing whatever within\r\nit or beyond it.\r\n\r\n[357]\r\n\r\n     And, with dim-fretted foreheads all,\r\n     On corpses _three_ months old at noon she came.\r\n\r\n         (_The Palace of Art._)\r\n\r\n[358] If anybody cannot tolerate the stretching he had better abstain\r\nfrom Alexander the younger's work, for \"they all do it\" there. The fact\r\nmay have conciliated some of our own contemners of \"good form.\"\r\n\r\n[359] Every one is entitled to write this word once in his life, I\r\nbelieve; so I have selected my occasion at last. Of course some one may\r\nsay: \"You have admitted that he did not know Marguerite's pact with his\r\nfather.\" True; and this might excuse the wrath, but not the way of\r\nshowing it.\r\n\r\n[360] As I write this I remember a comic experience of fifty years ago.\r\nI was trying to find out the ruins of a certain castle in Brittany, and\r\nappealed, in my very best bad French, to an old road-mender. He scowled\r\nat me, as if it had been in the days of the _Combat des Trente_, and\r\nanswered, \"_Mais c'est de l'Anglais que vous me parlez là!_\"\r\n\r\n[361] Another trait of his may not displease readers, though it be not\r\nstrictly relevant. I once, perhaps with some faint mischievous intent,\r\nasked him about the competence of Dr. Pusey and of M. Renan in the\r\nsacred tongue. \"Pusey,\" he said, \"knew pretty well everything about\r\nHebrew that there was to be known in his day.\" He was not quite so\r\ncomplimentary about Renan; though, as he put his judgment less\r\npointedly, I do not remember the exact words.\r\n\r\n[362] With a bow and arrows, remember; not a Browning pistol.\r\n\r\n[363] The indebtedness to Michelet is pretty obvious.\r\n\r\n[364] It may be well to illustrate this, lest it be said that having\r\nbeen more than just to the father (_v. sup._) I am still less than just\r\nto the son. Merlin is made to visit Morgane la Fée in the _eleventh_\r\ncentury. It is quite true that people generally began to hear about\r\nMerlin and Morgane at that time. But he had then been for about half a\r\nmillennium in the sweet prison of the Lady of the Lake--over whom even\r\nMorgane had no power. The English child-King, for whom Bedford was\r\nregent, is repeatedly called Henry _IV_. There would have been quite\r\nother fish for Joan to fry, and other thread for her to retwist, if she\r\nhad had to do with Henry of Bolingbroke instead of Henry of Windsor.\r\nTristan's Mauthe Doog--not a bad kind of hound, though--bears the\r\n\"Celtic\" name of Thor. Of course all these things are trifles, but they\r\nare annoying and useless. When the father abridged Charles the First's\r\ncaptivity from years to days, he did it for the good of his story. The\r\nson had no such justification. He is also very careless about minute\r\njoinings of the flats at a most important point of the conclusion (_v.\r\ninf._). Tristan has no sword, begs one of the _bourreau_, and is\r\nrefused. He goes straight to church, and immediately afterwards we find\r\nhim sword in hand. Where did he get it? By an unmentioned miracle?\r\n\r\n[365] Tristan defeats an effort of Xaintrailles to rescue her, in a way\r\nvaguely resembling the defeat, in the greater Alexander's work, of the\r\nrescue of King Charles by the Four.\r\n\r\n[366] Unluckily, with a young man's misjudgment, Dumas would not let it\r\nbe the actual end, though that is not a couple of pages off. After the\r\nfight Tristan goes out of the tomb to rest himself; and meets the herald\r\nBretagne, whom he had saved from the wolves in the overture. Bretagne\r\ntells him what has happened since the Maid's death, including the fate\r\nof his half-brother on the father's side, Gilles de Retz, who, like\r\nhimself, has repented in time to save his soul, if not his life. Having\r\nalso seen afar off a cavalcade in which are Olivier and Alix, now\r\nmarried and rapturous, Tristan retires into the tomb, which closes over\r\nhim. His horse \"Baal\" and his dogs, the \"Celtically\" (in the latter case\r\nwe may say _Piratically_) named Thor and Brinda, are petrified round its\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\n[367] Crusading times, and Jôf or Edessa for Rouen and Poitiers as\r\nplaces, might seem preferable. But the fifteenth century did a lot of\r\n_diablerie_ in the West.\r\n\r\n[368] A curious variant of this fancy of his will be noticed later. What\r\nis more curious still need, perhaps, hardly be indicated for any\r\nintelligent reader--the \"sicklying over\" of Paul-de-Kockery with a \"cast\r\nof thought\"--\"pale,\" or \"dry,\" or up to \"Old Brown\" in strength and\r\ncharacter as it may seem to different people.\r\n\r\n[369] As I have received complaints, mild and other, of the frequency of\r\nmy unexplained allusions, I may here refer explicitly to Mr. Traill's\r\n_Recaptured Rhymes_; and if anybody, after looking up the book, is not\r\ngrateful to me, I am sorry for him. For the commoner practice here I can\r\nonly plead that I follow the Golden Rule. Nothing pleases _me_ so much\r\nas an allusion that I understand--except one that I don't and have to\r\nhunt up.\r\n\r\n[370] _Rather_ too big a title for an adventurer to meddle with, surely?\r\n\r\n[371] He has found out a secret about her. When she learns his crimes\r\nand his fate, she puts an end to herself in a way which I fear Octave\r\nFeuillet borrowed, rather unceremoniously, though he certainly improved\r\nit, in _Julia de Trécoeur_ (_v. inf._). I did not read _Trois Hommes\r\nForts_ till many years after I had read and praised Feuillet's work.\r\nAlso, is it absolutely blasphemous to suggest that the beginning of the\r\nbook has a faint likeness to that of _Les Misérables_ much later?\r\n\r\n[372] _V. sup._ last chapter, _passim_.\r\n\r\n[373] One remembers, as so often, Dr. Johnson to Boswell: \"This lady of\r\nyours, Sir, is very fit for,\" etc.\r\n\r\n[374] This is, I think, the best of his short stories. _Thérèse_ is\r\nrather a sermon on the somewhat unsavoury text of morbid appetite in the\r\nother sex, than a real story. The little _Histories Vraies_, which he\r\nwrote with a friend for the _Moniteur_ in 1864, are fairly good. For the\r\nformally entitled _Contes et Nouvelles_ and the collection headed by\r\n_Ilka_, _v. inf._\r\n\r\n[375] He represents himself as suffering forty-eight hours of very easy\r\nimprisonment for not mounting guard as a \"National,\" and writing the\r\nstory to pass the time.\r\n\r\n[376] The author has shown his skill by inducing at least one very old\r\nhand to wonder, for a time at least, whether Dr. Servans is a quack, or\r\na lunatic, or Hoffmannishly uncanny, when he is, in fact, something\r\nquite different from any of these.\r\n\r\n[377] The other, Clémentine (who is not very unlike a more modern Claire\r\nd'Orbe), being not nearly so \"candid\" as her comrade Marie, continues\r\nhonest.\r\n\r\n[378] _V. sup._ Vol. I. p. 204.\r\n\r\n[379]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Revenants. Sophie Printemps._]\r\n\r\nTwo early and slight books (one of them, perhaps, the \"bad\" one referred\r\nto above) may find place in a note. _Revenants_ is a fantasy, in which\r\nthe three most famous pairs of lovers of the later eighteenth century,\r\nDes Grieux and Manon, Paul and Virginie, Werther and Charlotte, are\r\nrevived and brought together (_v. sup._ p. 378). This sort of thing, not\r\nseldom tried, has very seldom been a success; and _Revenants_ can hardly\r\nbe said to be one of the lucky exceptions. _Sophie Printemps_ is the\r\nhistory of a good girl, who, out of her goodness, deliberately marries\r\nan epileptic. It has little merit, except for a large episode or\r\nparenthesis of some forty or fifty pages (nearly a sixth of the book),\r\ntelling the prowess of a peremptory but agreeable baron, who first foils\r\na dishonest banker, and then defends this very banker against an\r\nadventurer more rascally than himself, whom the baron kills in a duel.\r\nThis is good enough to deserve extraction from the book, and separate\r\npublication as a short story.\r\n\r\n[380] It is constantly called (and I fear I have myself sinned in this\r\nrespect) _L'Affaire Clémenceau_. But this is not the proper title, and\r\ndoes not really fit. It is the heading of a client's instruction--a sort\r\nof irregular \"brief\"--to the advocate who (_resp. fin._) is to defend\r\nhim; and is thus an autobiographic narrative (diversified by a few\r\n\"put-in\" letters) throughout. The title is the label of the brief.\r\n\r\n[381] This is probably meant as the first \"fight\" on the shady side of\r\nIza's character; not that, in this instance, she means to insult or\r\nhurt, but that the probability of hurting and insulting does not occur\r\nto her, or leaves her indifferent.\r\n\r\n[382] Second \"light,\" and now not dubious, for it is made a point of\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n[383] It has sometimes amused me to remember that some of the warmest\r\nadmirers of Dumas _fils_ have been among the most violent decriers of\r\nThackeray--_for_ preaching. I suppose they preferred the Frenchman's\r\ntexts.\r\n\r\n[384] Neither morality, nor friendship, nor anything like sense of \"good\r\nform\" could be likely to hold him back. But he is represented as nothing\r\nif not _un homme fort_ in character and temperament, who knows his woman\r\nthoroughly, and must perceive that he is letting himself be beaten by\r\nher in the very act of possessing her.\r\n\r\n[385] Vide _Mr. Midshipman Easy_.\r\n\r\n[386] This phrase may require just a word of explanation. I admitted\r\n(Vol. I. p. 409) the abnormality in _La Religieuse_ as not\r\ndisqualifying. But this was not an abnormality of the _individual_.\r\nIza's is.\r\n\r\n[387] Perhaps I may add another subject for those who like it. \"Both\r\nManon and Iza do _prefer_, and so to speak only _love_, the one lover.\r\nDoes this in Iza's case aggravate, or does it partially redeem, her\r\ngeneral behaviour?\" A less disputable addition, for the reason given\r\nabove, may be a fairly long note on the author's work outside of\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Note on Dumas _fils'_ drama, etc.]\r\n\r\nWith the drama which has received such extraordinary encomia (the great\r\nname of Molière having even been brought in for comparison) I have no\r\nexhaustive acquaintance; but I have read enough not to wish to read any\r\nmore. If the huge prose tirades of _L'Étrangère_ bore me (as they do) in\r\nthe study, what would they do on the stage, where long speeches, not in\r\ngreat poetry, are always intolerable? (I have always thought it one of\r\nthe greatest triumphs of Madame Sarah Bernhardt that, at the very\r\nbeginning of her career, she made the heroine of this piece--_if_ she\r\ndid so--interesting.) Over the _Fils Naturel_ I confess that even I, who\r\nhave struggled with and mastered my thousands, if not my tens of\r\nthousands, of books, broke down hopelessly. _Francillon_ is livelier,\r\nand might, in the earlier days, have made an amusing novel. But\r\ndiscounting, judicially and not prejudicially, the excessive laudation,\r\none sees that even here he did what he meant to do, and though there is\r\nhigher praise than that, it is praise only too seldom deserved. As for\r\nhis Prefaces and Pamphlets, I think nearly as much must be granted; and\r\nI need not repeat what has been said above on the other side. The\r\ncharity \"puff\" of _Les Madeleines Repenties_ is an admirable piece of\r\nrhetoric not seldom reaching eloquence; and it has the not unliterary\r\nside-interest of suggesting the question whether its ironic treatment of\r\nthe general estimate of the author as Historiographer Royal to the venal\r\nVenus is genuine irony, or a mere mask for annoyance. The Preface to the\r\ndreary _Fils Naturel_ (it must be remembered that Alexander the Younger\r\nhimself was originally illegitimate and only later legitimated), though\r\nrhetorical again, is not dreary at all. It contains a very agreeable\r\naddress to his father--he was always agreeable, though with a suspicion\r\nof rather amusing patronage-upside-down, on this subject--and a good\r\ndeal else which one would have been sorry to lose. In fact, I can see,\r\neven in the dramas, even in the prose pamphleteering, whether the matter\r\ngives me positive delight or not, evidence of that _competence_, that\r\nnot so seldom mastery, of treatment which entitles a man to be\r\nconsidered not the first comer by a long way.\r\n\r\n[388] The obliging gentleman who on this occasion plays the part of\r\n\"substitute\" in a cricket-match, is the most elaborate and confessed\r\nexample of Dumas' \"theorised\" _men_. He is what the seedsmen call an\r\n\"improved Valmont,\" with more of lion in him than to meddle with\r\nvirgins, but absolutely destructive to duchesses and always ready to\r\nsuggest substitution to distressed grass-widows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nGUSTAVE FLAUBERT\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The contrast of Flaubert and Dumas _fils_.]\r\n\r\nIn doing, as may at least be hoped, justice to M. Alexandre Dumas _fils_\r\nin the last chapter, one point was excepted--that though I could rank\r\nhim higher than I ever expected to do as a novelist, I could not exactly\r\nrank his work in the highest range of literature. When you compare\r\nhim--not merely with those greatest in novel-work already discussed, but\r\nwith Musset or Vigny, with Nodier, or with Gérard de Nerval, not to\r\nmention others, there is something which is at once \"weird and wanting,\"\r\nas the admirable Captain Mayne Reid says at the beginning of _The\r\nHeadless Horseman_, though one cannot say here, as there, \"By Heavens!\r\nit is 'the head!'\" There is head enough of a kind--a not at all unkempt\r\nor uncomely headpiece, very well filled with brains. But it has no\r\naureole, as the other preferred persons cited in the last sentence and\r\nearlier have. This aureole may be larger or smaller, brighter or less\r\nbright--a full circlet of unbroken or hardly broken splendour, or a sort\r\nof will-o'-the-wisp cluster of gleam and darkness. But wherever it is\r\nfound there is, in differing degrees, _literature_ of the highest class;\r\nof the major prose _gentes_; literature that can show itself with\r\npoetry, under its own conditions and with its own possibilities, and\r\nfear no disqualification. Of this I am bound to say I do not find very\r\nmuch in this second division of our volume, and I find none in Dumas\r\n_fils_. But I find a great deal more than in any one else in Gustave\r\nFlaubert.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some former dealings with him.]\r\n\r\nAs I have said this, the reader may expect, magisterially, dreadingly,\r\nor perhaps in some very \"gentle\" cases hopefully, a full chapter on\r\nFlaubert. He shall have it. But the same cause, or group of causes,\r\nwhich has been at work before prevents this from being a very long one,\r\nand from containing very full accounts of his novels. One of the longest\r\nand most careful of those detailed surveys of forty years ago, to which\r\nI have perhaps too often referred, was devoted to Flaubert, and was\r\nslightly supplemented after his death. The earlier form had, though I\r\ndid not know it for a considerable time, not displeased himself--a\r\nfortunate result not too common between author and critic[389]--and\r\nthere are, consequently, special reasons for leaving it unaltered and\r\nunrehashed. I shall, therefore, as with Balzac and Dumas, attempt a\r\nshorter but more general judgment, which--his work being so much less\r\nvoluminous than theirs--may be perhaps even less extensive than in the\r\nother cases,[390] but which should leave no doubt as to the writer's\r\nopinion of his \"place in the story.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His style.]\r\n\r\nNo small part of that high claim to purely literary rank which has been\r\nmade for him rests, of course, upon his mere style--that famous and much\r\ndebated \"chase of the single word\" which, especially since Mr. Pater\r\ntook up the discussion of it, has been a \"topic\" of the most usitate in\r\nEngland as well as in France. When I left my chair and my library at\r\nEdinburgh I burnt more lecture-notes on the subject than would have\r\nfurnished material for an entire chapter here, and I have no intention\r\nof raking my memory for their ashes. The battle on the one side with the\r\nanti-Unitarians who regard \"monology\" as a fond thing vainly invented,\r\nand on the other with Edmond de Goncourt's foolish and bumptious boast\r\nthat Flaubert's epithets were not so \"personal\" as his own and his\r\nbrother's, would be for a different division of literary history. But\r\nthere is something--a very important, though not a very long\r\nsomething--which must be said on the subject here. I have never found\r\nmyself in the very slightest degree _gêné_--as the _abonné_ was by\r\nGautier's and as others are by the styles of Mr. George Meredith and Mr.\r\nHenry James--by Flaubert's style. It has never put the very smallest\r\nimpediment, effected the most infinitesimal delay, in my comprehension\r\nof his meaning, or my enjoyment of his art and of his story.[391] What\r\nis more, though it has intensified that enjoyment, it has never--as may\r\nperhaps have been the case with some other great \"stylists\"--_diverted_,\r\na little illegitimately, my attention and fruition from the story\r\nitself. Style-craft and story-craft have married each other so perfectly\r\nthat they are one flesh for the lover of literature to rejoice in. And\r\nif there be higher praise than this to be bestowed in the cases and\r\ncircumstances, I do not know what it is. It seems to belong in\r\nperfection--I do not deny it to others in lesser degree--to three\r\nwriters only in this volume--Gautier, Mérimée, and Flaubert--though if\r\nany one pleads hard for the addition of Maupassant, it will be seen when\r\nwe come to him that I am not bound to a rigid _non possumus_; and though\r\nthere is still one living writer with whom, if he were not happily\r\ndisqualified by the fact of his living, I should not refuse to complete\r\nthe Pentad. But let this suffice for the mere point of style in its\r\npurer and therefore more controversial aspect. There may be a little\r\nmore to say incidentally as we take the general survey under the old\r\nheads of plot, etc. But before doing this we must--the books being so\r\nfew and so individually remarkable--say a little about each of them,\r\nthough only a very little about one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The books--_Madame Bovary_.]\r\n\r\nFlaubert, after fairly early promise, the fulfilment of which was\r\npostponed, began late, and was a man of eight and thirty when his first\r\ncomplete book, _Madame Bovary_, appeared in 1859--a year, with its\r\npredecessor 1858, among the great years of literature, as judged by the\r\nbooks they produced. An absurd prosecution was got up against it by the\r\nauthorities of that most moral of _régimes_, the Second Empire, with the\r\neven more absurd result of a \"not guilty, but please don't do anything\r\nof the kind again\" judgment. This, however, belongs mostly--not (_v.\r\ninf._) entirely--to the biographical part of the matter, with which we\r\nhave little or nothing to do.[392] The book itself is, beyond all\r\nquestion, a great novel--if it had a greater subject[393] it would have\r\nbeen one of the greatest of novels. The immense influence of _Manon\r\nLescaut_ appears once more in it; but Emma Bovary, with far more than\r\nall the bad points of Manon, has none of her good ones. Nor has she the\r\nhalf-redeeming greatness in evil of her somewhat younger sister Iza in\r\n_Affaire Clémenceau_. Except her physical beauty (of which we do not\r\nhear much), there is not one attractive point in her. She sins, not out\r\nof passion, but because she thinks a married woman ought to have lovers.\r\nShe ruins her husband, not for any intrinsic and genuine love of\r\nsplendour, luxury, or beauty, but because other women have things and\r\nshe ought to have them. She has a taste _for_ men, but none _in_ them.\r\nYet her creator has made her absolutely \"real,\" and, scum of womanhood\r\nas she is, has actually evolved something very like tragedy out of her\r\nworthlessness, and has saved her from being detestable, because she is\r\nsuch a very woman. He has, indeed, subjected her to a _kenosis_, an\r\nevisceration, exantlation--or, in plain English, \"emptying out\"--of\r\neverything positively good (she has the negative but necessary salve of\r\nnot being absolutely ill-natured) that can be added to an abstract\r\npretty girl; and no more. I have paid a little attention to the heroines\r\nof the greater fiction; but she is the only one of all the _mille e tre_\r\nI know whom the author has managed to present as acceptable, without its\r\nbeing in the least possible to fall in love with her, and at the same\r\ntime without its being necessary to detest her.\r\n\r\nThis defiant and victorious naturalness--not \"naturalism\"--pervades the\r\nbook: from the other main characters--the luckless, brainless,\r\ntasteless, harmless husband; the vulgar Don Juans of lovers; the\r\napothecary Homais[394]--one of the most original and firmly drawn\r\ncharacters in fiction--from all, down to the merest \"supers.\" It floods\r\nthe scene-painting (admirable in itself) with a light of common day--not\r\ntoo cheerful, but absolutely real. It animates the conversation, though\r\nFlaubert is not exactly prodigal of this;[395] and it presides over the\r\nweaving of the story as such in a fashion very little, if at all,\r\ninferior to that which prevails in the very greatest masters of pure\r\nstory-telling.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Salammbô._]\r\n\r\nHardly any one, speaking critically, could, I suppose, also speak thus\r\npositively about Flaubert's second book, _Salammbô_--a romance of\r\nCarthaginian history at the time of the Mutiny of the Mercenaries. Even\r\nSainte-Beuve--no weak-stomached reader--was put off by its blotches of\r\nblood and grime, and by the sort of ghastly gorgeousness which, if it\r\ndoes not \"relieve\" these, forms a kind of background to throw them up.\r\nIt was violently attacked by clever carpers like M. de Pontmartin, by\r\neccentrics of half-genius and whole prejudice like M. Barbey\r\nd'Aurevilly, and by dull pedants like M. Saint-René Taillandier; while\r\nit may be questioned whether, to the present day, its friends have not\r\nmostly belonged to that \"Save-me-from-them\" class which simply extols\r\nthe \"unpleasant\" because other people find it unpleasant.[396] For my\r\nown part, I did not enjoy it much at the very first; but I felt its\r\npower at once, and, as always happens in such cases when admiration does\r\nnot come from the tainted source just glanced at, the enjoyment\r\nincreased, and the sense of power increased with it, the\r\n\"unpleasantness,\" as a known thing, becoming merely \"discountable\" and\r\ndisinfected. The book can, of course, never rank with _Madame Bovary_,\r\nbecause it is a _tour de force_ of abnormality--a thing incompatible\r\nwith that highest art which consists in the transformation and\r\ntranscendentalising of the ordinary. The leprosies, and the\r\ncrucifixions, and the sorceries, and the rest of it are ugly; but then\r\nCarthage _was_ ugly, as far as we know anything about it.[397] Salammbô\r\nherself is shadowy; but how could a Carthaginian girl be anything else?\r\nThe point to consider is the way in which all this unfamiliar, uncanny,\r\nunpleasant stuff is _fused_ by sheer power of art into something which\r\nhas at least the reality of a bad dream--which, as most people know, is\r\na very real thing indeed while it lasts, and for a little time after. It\r\nincreases the wonder--though to me it does not increase the interest--to\r\nknow that Flaubert took the most gigantic pains to make his task as\r\ndifficult as possible by acquiring and piecing together the available\r\nknowledge on his subject. This process--the ostensible _sine qua non_ of\r\n\"Realism\" and \"Naturalism\"--will require further treatment. It is almost\r\nenough for the present to say that, though not a novelty, it had been,\r\nand for the matter of that has been, rarely a success. It has, as was\r\npointed out before, spoilt most classical novels, reaching its acme of\r\nboredom in the German work of Ebers and Dahn; and it has scarcely ever\r\nbeen very successful, even in the hands of Charles Reade, who used it\r\n\"with a difference.\" But it can hardly be said to have done _Salammbô_\r\nmuch harm, because the \"fusing\" process which is above referred to, and\r\nto which the imported elements are often so rebellious, is here\r\nperfectly carried out. You may not like the colour and shape of the\r\ningot or cast; but there is nothing in it which has not duly felt and\r\nobeyed the fire of art.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _L'Éducation Sentimentale._]\r\n\r\nThat there was no danger of Flaubert's merely palming off, in his novel\r\nwork, replicas with a few superficial differences, had now been shown.\r\nIt was further established by his third and longest book, _L'Éducation\r\nSentimentale_. This was not only, as the others had been, violently\r\nattacked, but was comparatively little read--indeed it is the only one\r\nof his books, with the usual exception of _Bouvard et Pécuchet_, which\r\nhas been called, by any rational creature, dull. I do not find it so;\r\nbut I confess that I find its intrinsic interest, which to me is great,\r\nlargely enhanced by its unpopularity--which supplies a most remarkable\r\npendant to that of _Jonathan Wild_, and is by no means devoid of value\r\nas further illustrating the cause of the very limited popularity of\r\nThackeray, and even of the rarity of whole-hearted enthusiasm for Swift.\r\nSatire is allowed to be a considerable, and sometimes held to be an\r\nattractive, branch of literature. But when you come to analyse the\r\nactual sources of the attraction, it is to be feared that you will\r\ngenerally find them to lie outside of the pure exposure of general human\r\nweaknesses. A very large proportion of satire is personal, and\r\npersonality is always popular. Satire is very often \"naughty,\" and\r\n\"naughtiness\" is to a good many, _qua_ naughtiness, \"nice.\" It lends\r\nitself well to rhetoric; and there is no doubt, whatever superior\r\npersons may say of it, that rhetoric _does_ \"persuade\" a large portion\r\nof the human race. It is constantly associated with directly comic\r\ntreatment, sometimes with something not unlike tragedy; and while the\r\nfirst, if of any merit, is sure, the second has a fair though more\r\nrestricted chance, of favourable reception. Try Aristophanes, Horace,\r\nJuvenal, Lucian, Martial; try the modern satirists of all kinds, and you\r\nwill always find these secondary sources of enjoyment present.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly one of them--if one--to be found in _L'Éducation\r\nSentimentale_. It is simply a panorama of human folly, frailty,\r\nfeebleness, and failure--never permitted to rise to any great heights or\r\nto sink to any infernal depths, but always maintained at a probable\r\nhuman level. We start with Frédéric Moreau as he leaves school at the\r\ncorrect age of eighteen. I am not sure at what actual age we leave him,\r\nthough it is at some point or other of middle life, the most active part\r\nof the book filling about a decade. But \"vanity is the end of all his\r\nways,\" and vanity has been the beginning and middle of them--a perfectly\r\nquiet and everyday kind of vanity, but vain from centre to\r\ncircumference and entire surface. He (one cannot exactly say\r\n\"tries,\" but) is brought into the possibility of trying love\r\nof various kinds--illegitimate-romantic, legitimate-not-unromantic,\r\nillegitimate-professional but not disagreeable, illegitimate-conventional.\r\nNothing ever \"comes off\" in a really satisfactory fashion. He is\r\n\"exposed\" (in the photographic-plate sense) to all, or nearly all, the\r\ninfluences of a young man's life in Paris--law, literature, art,\r\ninsufficient means, quite sufficient means, society, politics--including\r\nthe Revolution of 1848--enchantments, disenchantments--_tout ce qu'il\r\nfaut pour vivre_--to alter a little that stock expression for \"writing\r\nmaterials\" which is so common in French. But he never can get any real\r\n\"life\" out of any of these things. He is neither a fool, nor a cad, nor\r\nanything discreditable or disagreeable. He is \"only an or'nary person,\"\r\nto reach the rhythm of the original by adopting a slang form in not\r\nquite the slang sense. And perhaps it is not unnatural that other\r\nordinary persons should find him too faithful to their type to be\r\nwelcome. In this respect at least I may claim not to be ordinary. One\r\ngoes down so many empty wells, or wells with mere rubbish at the bottom\r\nof them, that to find Truth at last is to be happy with her (without\r\nprejudice to the convenience of another well or two here and there, with\r\nan agreeable Falsehood waiting for one). I do not know that _L'Éducation\r\nSentimentale_ is a book to be read very often; one has the substance in\r\none's own experience, and in the contemplation of other people's, too\r\nreadily at hand for that to be necessary or perhaps desirable. But a\r\ngreat work of art which is also a great record of nature is not too\r\ncommon--and this is what it is.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Tentation de Saint-Antoine_.]\r\n\r\nYet, as has been remarked before, nothing shows Flaubert's greatness\r\nbetter than his absolute freedom from the \"rut.\" Even in carrying out\r\nthe general \"Vanity\" idea he has no monotony. The book which followed\r\n_L'Éducation_ had been preluded, twenty years earlier, by some fragments\r\nin _L'Artiste_, a periodical edited by Gautier. But _La Tentation de\r\nSaint-Antoine_, when it finally appeared, far surpassed the promise of\r\nthese specimens. It is my own favourite among its author's books; and it\r\nis one of those which you can read merely for enjoyment or take as a\r\nsubject of study, just as you please--if you are wise you will give\r\n\"five in five score\" of your attentions to the latter occupation and the\r\nother ninety-five to the former. The people who had made up their minds\r\nto take Flaubert as a sort of Devil's Gigadibs--a \"Swiss, not of\r\nHeaven,\" but of the other place, hiring himself out to war on all things\r\ngood--called it \"an attack on the idea of God\"! As it, like its smaller\r\nand later counterpart _Saint Julien l'Hospitalier_, ends in a\r\nmanifestation of Christ, which would do honour to the most orthodox of\r\nSaints' Lives, the \"attack\" seems to be a curious kind of offensive\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the book takes its vaguely familiar subject, and\r\n_embroiders_ that subject with a fresh collection of details from\r\nuntiring research. The nearest approach to an actual person, besides the\r\ntormented Saint himself, is the Evil One, not at first _in propria\r\npersona_, but under the form of the Saint's disciple Hilarion, who at\r\nfirst acts as usher to the various elements of the Temptation-Pageant,\r\nand at last reveals himself by treacherous suggestions of unbelief. The\r\npageant itself is of wonderful variety. After a vividly drawn sketch of\r\nthe hermitage in the Thebaid, the drama starts with the more vulgar and\r\ndirect incitements to the coarser Deadly Sins and others--Gluttony,\r\nAvarice, Ambition, Luxury. Then Hilarion appears and starts theological\r\ndiscussion, whence arises a new series of actual visions--the excesses\r\nof the heretics, the degradation of martyrdom itself, the Eastern\r\ntheosophies, the monstrous cults of Paganism. After this, Hilarion tries\r\na sort of Modernism, contrasting the contradictions and absurdities of\r\nactual religions with a more and more atheistic Pantheism. This failing,\r\nthe Temptation reverts to the moral forms, Death and Vice contending for\r\nAnthony and bidding against each other. The next shift of the\r\nkaleidoscope is to semi-philosophical fantasies--the Sphinx, the\r\nChimaera, basilisks, unicorns, microscopic mysteries. The Saint is\r\nnearly bewildered into blasphemy; but at last the night wanes, the sun\r\nrises, and the face of Christ beams from it. The Temptation is\r\nended.[398]\r\n\r\nThe magnificence of the style, in which the sweep of this\r\ndream-procession over the stage is conveyed to the reader, is probably\r\nthe first thing that will strike him; and certainly it never palls. But,\r\nif not at once, pretty soon, any really critical mind must perceive\r\nsomething different from, and much rarer than, mere style. It is the\r\nextraordinary power--the exactness, finish, and freedom from any excess\r\nor waste labour, of the narrative, in reproducing dream-quality. A very\r\nlarge proportion--and there is nothing surprising in the fact--of the\r\nbest pieces of ornate prose in French, as well as in English, are busied\r\nwith dreams; but the writers have not invariably remembered one of the\r\nmost singular--and even, when considered from some points of view,\r\ndisquieting--features of a dream,--that you are never, while dreaming,\r\nin the least surprised at what happens. Flaubert makes no mistake as to\r\nthis matter. The real realism which had enabled him to re-create the\r\nmost sordid details of _Madame Bovary_, the half-historic grime and\r\ngorgeousness mixed of _Salammbô_, and the quintessentially ordinary life\r\nof _L'Éducation_, came mightily to his assistance in this his Vision of\r\nthe Desert. You see and hear its external details as Anthony saw and\r\nheard them: you almost feel its internal influence as if Hilarion had\r\nbeen--as if he _was_--at your side.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Trois Contes._]\r\n\r\nThe _Trois Contes_ which followed, and which practically completed\r\n(except for letters) Flaubert's finished work in literature,[399] have\r\none of those half-extrinsic interests which, once more, it is the duty\r\nof the historian to mention. They show that although, as has been said,\r\nFlaubert suffered from no monotony of faculty, the range of his\r\nfaculty--or rather the range of the subjects to which he chose to apply\r\nit--was not extremely wide. Of the twin stories, _Un Coeur Simple_ is,\r\nthough so unlike in particular, alike in general _ordinariness_ to\r\n_Madame Bovary_ and _L'Éducation Sentimentale_. The unlikeness in\r\nparticular is very striking, and shows that peculiar _victoriousness_ in\r\naccomplishing what he attempted which is so characteristic of Flaubert.\r\nIt is the history-no-history of a Norman peasant woman, large if simple\r\nof heart, simple and not large of brain, a born drudge and prey to\r\nunscrupulous people who come in contact with her, and almost in her\r\nsingle person uniting the Beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount. I\r\nadmire it now, without even the touch of rather youthful impatience\r\nwhich used, when I read it first, to temper my admiration. It is not a\r\n_berquinade_, because a _berquinade_ is never quite real. _Un Coeur\r\nSimple_ shares Flaubert's Realism as marvellously as any equal number of\r\npages of either of the books to which I have compared it. But there\r\n_is_, perhaps, something provocative--something almost placidly\r\ninsolent--about the way in which the author says, \"Now, I will give you\r\nnothing of the ordinary baits for admiration, and yet, were you the\r\nDevil himself, you shall admire me.\" And one does--in youth rather\r\nreluctantly--not so in age.\r\n\r\n_Herodias_ groups itself in the same general fashion, but even more\r\ndefinitely in particulars, with _Salammbô_--of which, indeed, it is a\r\nsort of miniature replica cunningly differentiated. Anybody can see how\r\neasily the story of the human witchcraft of Salome, and the decollation\r\nof the Saint, and the mixture of terror and gorgeousness in the desert\r\nfortress, parallel the Carthaginian story. But I do not know whether it\r\nwas deliberate or unconscious repetition that made Flaubert give us\r\nsomething like a duplicate of the suffete Hanno in Vitellius. There is\r\nno lack of the old power, and the shortness of the story is at least\r\npartly an advantage. But perhaps the Devil's Advocate, borrowing from,\r\nbut reversing, Hugo on Baudelaire, might say, \"Ce frisson _n'est pas_\r\nnouveau.\"\r\n\r\nThe third story, _Saint Julien l'Hospitalier_, has always seemed to me\r\nas near perfection in its own kind as anything I know in literature, and\r\none of the best examples, if not the very best example, of that\r\nadaptableness of the _Acta Sanctorum_ to modern rehandling of the right\r\nkind, which was noticed at the beginning of this _History_.[400] The\r\nexcessive devotion of the not yet sainted Julian to sport; the crime and\r\nthe dooms that follow it; the double parricide which he commits under\r\nthe false impression that his wife has been unfaithful to him; his\r\nself-imposed penance of ferrying, somewhat like Saint Christopher, and\r\nthe trial--a harder one than that good giant bore, for Julian has, not\r\nmerely to carry over but, to welcome, at board _and_ bed, a leper--and\r\nthe Transfiguration and Assumption that conclude the story, give some of\r\nthe best subjects--though there are endless others nearly or quite as\r\ngood--in Hagiology. And Flaubert has risen to them in the miraculous\r\nmanner in which he could rise, retaining the strangeness, infusing the\r\nreality, and investing the whole with the beauty, deserved and required.\r\nThere is not a weak place in the whole story; but the strongest places\r\nare, as they should be, the massacre of hart, hind, and fawn which\r\nbrings on the curse; the ghastly procession of the beasts Julian has\r\nslain or _not_ slain (for he has met with singular ill-luck); the final\r\n\"Translation.\"[401] Nowhere is Flaubert's power of description greater;\r\nnowhere, too, is that other power noticed--the removal of all temptation\r\nto say \"Very pretty, but rather _added_ ornament\"--more triumphantly\r\ndisplayed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Bouvard et Pécuchet._]\r\n\r\nLittle need be said of the posthumous torso and failure,[402] _Bouvard\r\net Pécuchet_. Nothing ever showed the wisdom of the proverb about\r\nhalf-done work, children and fools, better; and, alas! there is\r\nsomething of the child in all of us, and something of the fool in too\r\nmany. It was to be a sort of extended and varied _Éducation_, not\r\n_Sentimentale_. Two men of retired leisure and sufficient income resolve\r\nto spend the rest of their lives \"in books and work and healthful play,\"\r\nand almost as many other recreative occupations (including \"teaching the\r\nyoung idea how to shoot\") as they or you can think of. But the work\r\ngenerally fails, the books bore and disappoint them, the young ideas\r\nshoot in the most \"divers and disgusting\" ways, and the play turns out\r\nto be by no means healthful. Part of it is in scenario merely; and\r\nFlaubert was wont to alter so much, that one cannot be sure even of the\r\nother and more finished part. Perhaps it was too large and too dreary a\r\ntheme, unsupported by any real novel quality, to acquire even that\r\ninterest which _L'Éducation Sentimentale_ has for some. But the more\r\nexcellent way is to atone for the mistake of his literary executors, in\r\nnot burning all of it except the monumental phrase quoted above,\r\n\r\n    Ainsi tout leur a craqué dans la main,\r\n\r\nby simply remembering this--which is the initial and conclusion of the\r\nwhole matter--and letting the rest pass.\r\n\r\nThere is one slight danger in the estimate of Flaubert to which, though\r\nI actually pointed it out, I think I may have succumbed a little when I\r\nfirst wrote about him. He is so great a master of literature that one\r\nmay be led to concentrate attention on this; and if not to neglect, to\r\nregard somewhat inadequately, his greatness as a novelist. Here at any\r\nrate such failure would be petty, if not even high, treason.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General considerations.]\r\n\r\nOne may look at his performance in the novel from two points of\r\nview--that of \"judging by the result\" simply and in the fashion\r\nof a summing-up; and that of bringing him under certain\r\nticket-qualifications, and enquiring whether they are justly applicable\r\nto him or not. I need hardly tell any one who has done me the honour to\r\nread either this or any other critical work of mine, which of these two\r\nI think the more excellent way; but the less excellent in this\r\nparticular instance, may demand a little following.\r\n\r\nWas Flaubert a Romantic? Was he a Realist? Was he a Naturalist? This is\r\nhow the enquiries come in chronological order. But for convenience of\r\ndiscussion the first should be postponed to the others.\r\n\r\n\"Realist,\" like a good many other tickets, is printed on both sides, and\r\nthe answer to our question will be by no means the same whichever side\r\nbe looked at. That Flaubert was a Realist \"in the best sense of the\r\nterm\" has been again and again affirmed in the brief reviews of his\r\nnovels given above. He cannot be unreal--the \"convincingness\" of his\r\nmost sordid as of his most splendid passages; of his most fantastic\r\n_diableries_ as of his most everyday studies of society; is unsurpassed.\r\nIt is, in fact, his chief characteristic. But this very fact that it\r\n_pervades_--that it is as conspicuous in the _Tentation_ and in _Saint\r\nJulien l'Hospitalier_ as in _Madame Bovary_ and the _Éducation_--at once\r\nthrows up a formidable, I think an impregnable, line of defence against\r\nthose who would claim him for \"Realism\" of the other kind--the cult of\r\nthe ugly, because, being ugly, it is more real than the beautiful. He\r\nhas no fear of ugliness, but he cultivates the ugly because it is the\r\nreal, not the real because it is the ugly. Being to a great extent a\r\nsatirist and (despite his personal boyishness) saturnine rather than\r\njovial in temperament, there is a good deal in him that is _not_\r\nbeautiful. But he can escape into beauty whenever he chooses, and in\r\nthese escapes he is always at his best.\r\n\r\nThis fact, while leaving him a Realist of the nobler type, at once shuts\r\nhim off from community with his friends Zola and the Goncourts, and\r\nsaves him from any stain of the \"sable streams.\" But besides this--or\r\nrather looking at the same thing from a slightly different point of\r\nview--there is something which not only permits but demands the most\r\nemphatic of \"Noes!\" to the question, \"Was Flaubert a Naturalist?\"\r\n\r\nThis something is itself the equally emphatic \"Yes!\" which must be\r\nreturned to the third and postponed question, \"Was he a Romantic?\" There\r\nare many strange things in the History of Literature: its strangeness,\r\nas in other cases, is one of its greatest charms. But there have been\r\nfew stranger than the obstinacy and almost passion with which the\r\nRomanticism of Heine, of Thackeray, and of Flaubert has been denied.\r\nAgain and again it has been pointed out that \"to laugh at what you love\"\r\nis not only permissible, but a sign of the love itself. Moreover,\r\nFlaubert does not even laugh as the great Jew and the great Englishman\r\ndid. He only represents the failures and the disappointments and the\r\nfalse dawns of Love itself, while in other respects he is _romantique à\r\ntous crins_. Compare _Le Rêve_ with _La Tentation_ or _Saint-Julien\r\nl'Hospitalier_; compare _Madame Bovary_ with _Germinie Lacerteux_; even\r\ncompare _L'Éducation Sentimentale_, that voyage to the Cythera of\r\nRomance which never reaches its goal, with _Sapho_ and _L'Évangéliste_,\r\nand you will see the difference. It is of course to a certain extent \"Le\r\nCoucher du Soleil Romantique\" which lights up Flaubert's work, but the\r\n_crapauds imprévus_ and the _froids limaçons_ of Baudelaire's epitaph\r\nhave not yet appeared, and the hues of the sunset itself are still\r\ngorgeous in parts of the sky.\r\n\r\nOf Flaubert's famous doctrine of \"the single word\" perhaps a little more\r\nshould, after all, be said. The results are so good, and the processes\r\nby which they are attained get in the way of the reader so little, that\r\nit is difficult to quarrel with the doctrine itself. But it was perhaps,\r\nafter all, something of a superstition, and the almost \"fabulous\r\ntorments\" which it occasioned to its upholder and practitioner seem to\r\nhave been somewhat Fakirish. We need not grudge the five years spent\r\nover _Salammbô_; the seven over _L'Éducation_; the earlier and, I think,\r\nless definitely known gestation of _Madame Bovary_; and that portion of\r\nthe twenty which, producing these also, filled out those fragments of\r\n_La Tentation_ that the July Monarchy had actually seen. Perhaps with\r\n_Bouvard et Pécuchet_ he got into a blind alley, out of which such\r\nlabour was never like to get him, and in which it was rather likely to\r\nconfine him. But if the excess of the preparation had been devoted to\r\nthe completion of, say, only half a dozen of such _Contes_ as those we\r\nactually have, it would have been joyful.\r\n\r\nYet this is idle pining, and the goods which the gods provided in this\r\ninstance are such as ought rather to make us truly thankful. Flaubert\r\nwas, as has been said, a Romantic, but he was born late enough to avoid\r\nthe extravagances and the childishnesses of _mil-huit-cent-trente_ while\r\nretaining its inspiration, its _diable au corps_, its priceless recovery\r\nof inheritances from history. Nor, though he subjected all these to a\r\nsevere criticism of a certain kind, did he ever let this make him (as\r\nsomething of the same sort made his pretty near contemporary, Matthew\r\nArnold, in England) inclined to blaspheme.[403] He did not, like his\r\nother contemporary and peer in greatness of their particular country and\r\ngeneration, Baudelaire, play unwise tricks with his powers and his\r\nlife.[404] He was fortunately relieved from the necessity of\r\njourney-work--marvellously performed, but still journey-work--which had\r\nbeset Gautier and never let go of him.[405]\r\n\r\nAnd he utilised these gifts and advantages as few others have done in\r\nthe service of the novel. One thing may be brought against him--I think\r\none only. You read--at least I read--his books with intense interest and\r\nenjoyment, but though you may recognise the truth and humanity of the\r\ncharacters; though you may appreciate the skill with which they are set\r\nto work; though you may even, to a certain extent, sympathise with them,\r\nyou never--at least I never--feel that intense interest in them, as\r\npersons, which one feels in those of most of the greatest novelists. You\r\ncan even feel yourself in them--a rare and great thing--you can _be_\r\nSaint Anthony, and feel an unpleasant suspicion as if you had sometimes\r\nbeen Frédéric Moreau. But this is a different thing (though it is a\r\ngreat triumph for the author) from the construction for you of loves,\r\nfriends, enemies even--in addition to those who surround you in the\r\nactual world.\r\n\r\nExcept this defect--which is in the proper, not the vulgar sense a\r\ndefect--that is to say, not something bad which is present, but only\r\nsomething good which is absent--I hardly know anything wrong in\r\nFlaubert. He is to my mind almost[406] incomparably the greatest\r\nnovelist of France specially belonging to the second half of the\r\nnineteenth century, and I do not think that Europe at large has ever had\r\na greater since the death of Thackeray.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[389] He _might_ have said--to make a Thackerayan translation of what\r\nwas actually said later of an offering of roses rashly made to some\r\nFrench men of letters at their hotel in London: \"Who the devil is this?\r\nLet them flank him his vegetables to the gate!\" But what he did say, I\r\nbelieve, though he did not know or mention my name, was that \"a blonde\r\nson of Albion\" had ventured something _gigantesque_ on him. And\r\n_gigantesque_ had, if I do not again fondly err, sometimes if not always\r\nits \"milder shade\" of meaning in Flaubert's energetic mouth.\r\n\r\n[390] As in those cases, and perhaps even more than in most, I have\r\ntaken pains to make the new criticism as little of a replica of the old\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n[391] Possibly this is exactly what M. de Goncourt meant.\r\n\r\n[392] There is some scandal and infinite gossip about Flaubert, with all\r\nof which I was once obliged to be acquainted, but which I have done the\r\nbest that a rather strong memory will allow me to forget. I shall only\r\nsay that his early friend and quasi-biographer, Maxime du Camp, seems to\r\nme to have had nearly as hard measure dealt out to him as Mr. Froude in\r\nthe matter of Mr. Carlyle. Both were indiscreet; I do not think either\r\nwas malevolent or treacherous.\r\n\r\n[393] For in novels, to a greater degree than in poems, greatness _does_\r\ndepend on the subject.\r\n\r\n[394] Somebody has, I believe, suggested that if Emma had married\r\nHomais, all would have been well. If this means that he would have\r\npromptly and comfortably poisoned her, for which he had professional\r\nfacilities, there might be something in it. Otherwise, hardly.\r\n\r\n[395] His forte is in single utterances, such as the unmatched \"J'ai un\r\namant!\" to which Emma gives vent after her first lapse (and which\r\n\"speaks\" her and her fate, and the book in ten letters, two spaces, and\r\nan apostrophe), or as the \"par ce qu'elle avait touché au manteau de\r\nTanit\" of _Salammbô_; and the \"Ainsi tout leur a craqué dans la main\" of\r\nthe unfinished summary of _Bouvard et Pécuchet_.\r\n\r\n[396] It is known that Flaubert, perhaps out of rather boyish pique\r\n(there was much boyishness in him), had originally made its offence\r\nranker still. One of the most curious literary absurdities I have ever\r\nseen--the absurd almost drowning the disgusting in it--was an American\r\nattempt in verse to fill up Flaubert's _lacuna_ and \"go one better.\"\r\n\r\n[397] The old foreign comparison with London was merely rhetorical; but\r\nthere really would seem to have been some resemblance between Carthage\r\nand modern Berlin, even in those very points which Flaubert (taking\r\nadvice) left out.\r\n\r\n[398] There is a recent and exceptionally good translation of the book.\r\n\r\n[399] The Letters are almost, if not quite, of first-rate quality. The\r\nplay, _Le Candidat_, is of no merit.\r\n\r\n[400] Vol. I. p. 4.\r\n\r\n[401] All these will be found Englished in the Essay referred to.\r\n\r\n[402] Too much must not be read into the word \"failure\": indeed the next\r\nsentence should guard against this. I know excellent critics who,\r\ndeclining altogether to consider the book as a novel, regard it as a\r\nsort of satire and _satura_, Aristophanic, Jonsonian or other, in gist\r\nand form, and by no means a failure as such. But as such it would have\r\nno, or very small, place here. I think myself that it is, from that\r\npoint of view, nearer to Burton than to any one else: and I think\r\nfurther that it might have been made into a success of this kind or even\r\nof the novel sort itself. But _as it stands with the sketch of a\r\ncompletion_, I do not think that Flaubert's alchemy had yet achieved or\r\napproached projection.\r\n\r\n[403] I have sometimes wished that Mr. Arnold had written a novel. But\r\nperhaps _Volupté_ frightened him.\r\n\r\n[404] There is controversy on this point, and Baudelaire's indulgence in\r\nartificial and perilous Paradises may have been exaggerated. That it\r\nexisted to some extent is, I think, hardly doubtful.\r\n\r\n[405] I know few things of the kind more pathetic than Théo's quiet\r\nlament over the \"artistic completeness\" of his ill-luck in the collapse\r\nof the Second Empire just when, with Sainte-Beuve dead and Mérimée\r\ndying, he was its only man of letters of the first rank left, and might\r\nhave had some relief from collar-work. But it must be remembered that\r\nthough he had ground at the mill with slaves, he had never been one of\r\nthem, and perhaps this would always have prevented his promotion.\r\n\r\n[406] Reserving Maupassant under the \"almost.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE OTHER \"NON-NATURALS\" OF THE SECOND EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any excuse is needed for the oddity of the title of this chapter, it\r\nwill not be to readers of Burton's _Anatomy_. The way in which the\r\nphrase \"Those six non-natural things\" occurs and recurs there; the\r\ninextinguishable tendency--in view of the eccentricity of its\r\napplication--to forget that the six include things as \"natural\" (in a\r\nnon-technical[407] sense) as Diet, to forget also what it really means\r\nand expect something uncanny--these are matters familiar to all\r\nBurtonians. And they may excuse the borrowing of that phrase as a\r\ngeneral label for those novelists, other than Flaubert and Dumas _fils_,\r\nwho, if their work was not limited to 1850-70, began in (but not \"with\")\r\nthat period, and worked chiefly in it, while they were at once _not_\r\n\"Naturalists\" and yet more or less as \"natural\" as any of Burton's six.\r\nOne of the two least \"minor,\" Alphonse Daudet, was among Naturalists but\r\nscarcely of them. The other, Octave Feuillet, was anti-Naturalist to the\r\ncore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Feuillet.]\r\n\r\nThis latter, the elder of the two, though not so much the elder as used\r\nto be thought,[408] was at one time one of the most popular of French\r\nnovelists both at home and abroad; but, latterly in particular, there\r\nwere in his own country divers \"dead sets\" at him. He had been an\r\nImperialist, and this excited one kind of prejudice against him; he\r\nwas, in his way, orthodox in religion, and this aroused another; while,\r\nas has been already said, though his subjects, and even his treatment of\r\nthem, would have sent our English Mrs. Grundy of earlier days into\r\n\"screeching asterisks,\" the peculiar grime of Naturalism nowhere\r\nsmirches his pages. For my own part I have always held him high, though\r\nthere is a smatch about his morality which I would rather not have\r\nthere. He seems to me to be--with the no doubt numerous transformations\r\nnecessary--something of a French Anthony Trollope, though he has a\r\ntragic power which Trollope never showed; and, on the other side of the\r\naccount, considerably less comic variety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His novels generally.]\r\n\r\nAs a \"thirdsman\" to Flaubert and Dumas _fils_, he shows some interesting\r\ndifferences. Merely as a maker of literature, he cannot touch the\r\nformer, and has absolutely nothing of his poetic imagination, while his\r\ngrasp of character is somewhat thinner and less firm. But it is more\r\nvaried in itself and in the plots and scenery which give it play and\r\nsetting--a difference not necessary but fortunate, considering his very\r\nmuch larger \"output.\" Contrasted with Dumas _fils_, he affords a more\r\nimportant difference still, indeed one which is very striking. I pointed\r\nout in the appropriate place--not at the moment thinking of Feuillet at\r\nall--the strange fashion in which Alexander the Younger constantly\r\n\"makes good\" an at first unattractive story; and, even in his most\r\ngenerally successful work, increases the appeal as he goes on. With\r\nFeuillet the order of things is quite curiously reversed. Almost\r\n(though, as will be seen, not quite) invariably, from the early days of\r\n_Bellah_ and _Onestà_ to _La Morte_, he \"lays out\" his plan in a\r\nmasterly manner, and accumulates a great deal of excellent material, as\r\nit were by the roadside, for use as the story goes on. But, except when\r\nhe is at his very best, he flags, and is too apt to keep up his curtain\r\nfor a fifth act when it had much better have fallen for good at the end\r\nof the fourth. As has been noted already, his characters are not deeply\r\ncut, though they are faithfully enough sketched. That he is not strong\r\nenough to carry through a purpose-novel is not much to his discredit,\r\nfor hardly anybody ever has been. But the _Histoire de Sibylle_--his\r\nswashing blow in the George Sand duel (_v. sup._ p. 204)--though much\r\nless dull than the _riposte_ in _Mlle. la Quintaine_, would hardly\r\ninduce \"the angels,\" in Mr. Disraeli's famous phrase, to engage him\r\nfurther as a Hal-o'-the-Wynd on their side.\r\n\r\nBut Feuillet's most vulnerable point is the peculiar sentimental\r\nmorality-in-immorality which has been more than once glanced at. It was\r\nfrankly found fault with by French critics--themselves by no means\r\nstrait-laced--and the criticisms were well summed up (I remember the\r\nwording but not the writer of it) thus: \"An honest woman does not feel\r\nthe temptations\" to which the novelist exposes his heroines. That there\r\n_is_ a certain morbid sentimentality about Feuillet's attitude not\r\nmerely to the \"triangle\" but even to simple \"exchange of fantasies\"\r\nbetween man and woman in general, can hardly be denied. He has a most\r\ncurious and (one might almost say) Judaic idea as to woman as a\r\ntemptress, in fashions ranging from the almost innocent seduction of Eve\r\nthrough the more questionable[409] one of Delilah, down to the sheer\r\nattitude of Zuleika-Phraxanor, and the street-corner woman in the\r\nProverbs. And this necessitates a correspondingly unheroic presentation\r\nof his heroes. They are always being led into serious mischief (\"in a\r\nred-rose chain\" or a ribbon one), as Marmontel's sham philosopher[410]\r\nwas into comic confusion by that ingenious Présidente. Yet, allowing all\r\nthis, there remains to Feuillet's credit such a full and brilliant\r\nseries of novels, hardly one of which is an actual failure, as very few\r\nnovelists can show. Although he lived long and wrote to the end of his\r\nlife, he left no \"dotages\"; hardly could the youngest and strongest of\r\nany other school in France--Guy de Maupassant himself--have beaten _La\r\nMorte_, though it is not faultless, in power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brief notes on some--_Le Roman d'un jeune homme pauvre_.]\r\n\r\nI suppose few novels, succeeding not by scandal, have ever been much\r\nmore popular than the _Roman d'un jeune homme pauvre_, the title of\r\nwhich good English folk have been known slightly to alter in meaning by\r\nputting the _pauvre_ before the _jeune_. It had got into its third\r\nhundred of editions before the present century had reached the end of\r\nits own first lustrum, and it must have been translated (probably more\r\nthan once) into every European language. It is perfectly harmless; it is\r\nadmirably written; and the vicissitudes of the loves of the _marquis\r\ndéchu_ and the headstrong creole girl are conducted with excellent\r\nskill, no serious improbability, and an absence of that tendency to\r\n\"tail off\" which has been admitted in some of the author's books. It\r\nwas, I suppose, Feuillet's diploma-piece in almost the strictest\r\ntechnical sense of that phrase, for he was elected of the Academy not\r\nlong afterwards. It has plenty of merits and no important faults, but it\r\nis not my favourite.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _M. de Camors._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other books.]\r\n\r\nNeither is the novel which, in old days, the proud and haughty scorners\r\nof this _Roman_, as a _berquinade_, used to prefer--_M. de Camors_.[411]\r\nHere there is plenty of naughtiness, attempts at strong character, and\r\ncertainly a good deal of interest of story, with some striking incident.\r\nBut it is spoilt, for me, by the failure of the principal personage. I\r\nthink it not quite impossible that Feuillet intended M. de Camors as a\r\nsort of modernised, improved, and extended Lovelace, or even\r\nValmont--superior to scruple, destined and able to get the better of man\r\nor woman as he chooses. Unfortunately he has also endeavoured to make\r\nhim a gentleman; and the compound, as the chemists say, is not \"stable.\"\r\nThe coxcombry of Lovelace and the priggishness, reversed (though in a\r\nless detestable form), of Valmont, are the elements that chiefly remain\r\nin evidence, unsupported by the vigorous will of either. I have myself\r\nalways thought _La Petite Comtesse_ and _Julia de Trécoeur_ among the\r\nearlier novels, _Honneur d'Artiste_ and _La Morte_ among the later, to\r\nbe Feuillet's masterpieces, or at least nearest approaches to a\r\nmasterpiece. _Un Mariage dans le Monde_ (one or the rare instances in\r\nwhich the \"honest woman\" does get the better of her \"temptations\") is\r\nindeed rather interesting, in the almost fatal cross-misunderstanding of\r\nhusband and wife, and the almost fabulous ingenuity and good offices of\r\nthe \"friend of the family,\" M. de Kevern, who prevents both from making\r\nirreparable fools of themselves. _Les Amours de Philippe_ is more\r\ncommonplace--a prodigal's progress in love, rewarded at last, very\r\nundeservedly, with something better than a fatted calf--a formerly\r\nslighted but angelic cousin. But to notice all his work, more especially\r\nif one took in half- or quarter-dramatic things (his pure drama does not\r\nof course concern us) of the \"Scène\" and \"Proverbe\" kind, where he comes\r\nnext to Musset, would be here impossible. The two pairs, early and late\r\nrespectively, and already selected, must suffice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Petite Comtesse._]\r\n\r\nThey are all tragic, though there is comedy in them as well. Perhaps _La\r\nPetite Comtesse_, a very short novel and its author's first thing of\r\ngreat distinction, might by some be called pathetic rather than tragic;\r\nbut the line between the two is a \"leaden\" barrier (if indeed it is a\r\nbarrier at all) and \"gives\" freely. Perhaps the Gigadibs in any man of\r\nletters may be conciliated by one of his fellows being granted some of\r\nthe fascinations of the \"clerk\" in the old Phyllis-and-Flora _débats_ of\r\nmediaeval times; but the fact that _this_ clerk is also represented as a\r\nfool of the most disastrous, though not the most contemptible kind,\r\nshould be held as a set-off to the bribery. It is a \"story of\r\nthree\"--though not at all the usual three--graced (or not) by a really\r\nbrilliant picture of the society of the early Second Empire. One of the\r\nleaders of this--a young countess and a member of the \"Rantipole\"[412]\r\nset of the time, but exempt from its vulgarity--meets in the country,\r\nand falls in love with, a middle-aged _savant_, who is doing\r\narchaeological work for Government in the neighbourhood. He despises her\r\nas a frivolous feather-brain at first, but soon falls under the spell.\r\nYet what has been called \"the fear of the 'Had-I-wist'\" and the special\r\nnotion--more common perhaps with men than is generally thought--that she\r\ncannot _really_ love him, makes him resist her advances. By rebound, she\r\nfalls victim for a time to a commonplace Lovelace; but finds no\r\nsatisfaction, languishes and dies, while the lover, who would not take\r\nthe goods the gods provided, tries to play a sort of altered part of\r\nColonel Morden in _Clarissa_, and the gods take their revenge for\r\n\"sinned mercies.\" In abstract (it has been observed elsewhere that\r\nFeuillet seldom abstracts well, his work being too much built up of\r\ndelicate touches) there may seem to be something of the preposterous in\r\nthis; but it must be a somewhat coarse form of testing which discovers\r\nany real preposterousness in the actual story.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Julia de Trécoeur._]\r\n\r\nIt may, however, as has been said, seem to some to belong to the\r\npathetic-sentimental rather than to the actually tragic; I at least\r\ncould not allow any such judging of _Julia de Trécoeur_, though there\r\nare more actual faults in it than in _La Petite Comtesse_, and though,\r\nas has been mentioned elsewhere, the rather repulsive catastrophe may\r\nhave been more or less borrowed. The _donnée_ is one of the great old\r\nsimple cross-purposes of Fate--not a mere \"conflict,\" as the silly\r\nmodern jargon has it. Julia de Trécoeur is a wilful and wayward girl,\r\nas are many others of Feuillet's heroines. Her mother is widowed early,\r\nbut consoles herself; and Julia--as such a girl pretty certainly would\r\ndo--resents the proceeding, and refuses to live at home or to see her\r\nstepfather. He, however, is a friend of his wife's own cousin, and this\r\ncousin, conceiving a passion for Julia, offers to marry her. Her\r\nconsent, in an English girl, would require some handling, but offers no\r\ndifficulties in a French one. As a result, but after a time, she agrees\r\nto meet her mother and that mother's new husband. And then the tragedy\r\nbegins. She likes at once, and very soon loves, her stepfather--he\r\nsuccumbs, more slowly, to Moira and Até. But he is horrified at the\r\nnotion of a quasi-incestuous love, and Julia perceives his horror. She\r\nforces her horse, like the Duchess May, but over the cliffs of the\r\nCotentin, not over a castle wall; and her husband and her stepfather\r\nhimself see the act without being able--indeed without trying--to\r\nprevent it. The actual place had nearly been the scene of a joint\r\nsuicide by the unhappy lovers before.\r\n\r\nOnce more, the thing comes badly out of analysis--perhaps by the\r\nanalyst's fault, perhaps not. But in its own presentation, with some\r\nfaults hardly necessary to point out, it is both poignant and\r\n_empoignant_, and it gives a special blend of pity and terror, the two\r\nfeelings being aroused by no means merely through the catastrophe, but\r\nby the rise and progress of the fatal passion which leads to it. I know\r\nvery few, if any, things of the same kind, in a French novel, superior,\r\nor indeed equal to, the management of this, and to the fashion in which\r\nthe particular characters, or wants of character, of Julia's mother and\r\nJulia's husband (excellent persons both) are made to hurry on the\r\ncalamity[413] to which she was fated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Honneur d'Artiste._]\r\n\r\nThis tragic undercurrent, surging up to a more tragic catastrophe,\r\nreappears in the two best of the later issues, when Feuillet was making\r\nbetter head against the burst sewers[414] of Naturalism. _Honneur\r\nd'Artiste_ is the less powerful of the two; but what of failure there\r\nis in it is rather less glaring. Beatrice de Sardonne, the heroine, is a\r\nsort of \"Petite Comtesse\" transformed--very cleverly, but perhaps not\r\nquite successfully. _Her_ \"triangle\" consists of herself, a somewhat\r\nNew-Yorkised young French lady of society (but too good for the worst\r\npart of her); and her two lovers, the Marquis de Pierrepont, a much\r\nbetter Lovelace, in fact hardly a Lovelace at all, whom she is\r\nengineered into refusing for honourable love--with a fatal relapse into\r\ndishonourable; and the \"Artiste\" Jacques Fabrice. He adores her, but\r\nshe, alas! does not know whether she loves him or not till too late;\r\nand, after the irreparable, he falls by the hazard of the lot in that\r\ntoss-up for suicide, the pros and cons of which (as in a former\r\ninstance) I should like to see treated by a philosophical historian of\r\nthe duello.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Morte._]\r\n\r\nIn _La Morte_, on the other hand, the power is even greater--in fact it\r\nis the most powerful book of its author, and one of the most powerful of\r\nthe later nineteenth century. But there is in it a reversion to the\r\n\"purpose\" heresy; and while it is an infinitely finer novel than the\r\n_Histoire de Sibylle_, it is injured, though not quite fatally, by the\r\nweapon it wields. One of the heroines, Sabine, niece and pupil of an\r\nAgnostic _savant_, deliberately poisons the other, Aliette, that she may\r\nmarry Aliette's husband. But the Agnostic teaching extends itself soon\r\nfrom the Sixth Commandment to the Seventh, and M. de Vaudricourt, who,\r\nthough not ceasing to love Aliette, and having no idea of the murder,\r\nhas been ensnared into second marriage by Sabine, discovers, at almost\r\nthe same time, that his wife is a murderess and a strumpet. She is also\r\n(one was going to say) something worse, a daughter of the horse-leech\r\nfor wealth and pleasure and position. Now you _may_ be an Agnostic and a\r\nmurderess and a strumpet and a female snob all at once: but no\r\nanti-Agnostic, who is a critic likewise, will say that the second,\r\nthird, and fourth characteristics necessarily, and all together, follow\r\nfrom Agnosticism. It may remove some bars in their way; but I can\r\nfrankly admit that I do not think it need definitely superinduce them,\r\nor that it is altogether fair to accumulate the _post hocs_ with their\r\ninevitable suggestion of _propter_.\r\n\r\nHowever, \"Purpose\" here is simply at its old tricks, and I have known it\r\ndo worse things than caution people against Agnostics' nieces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Misters the assassins.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the vigour, the variety, and (where the purpose does\r\nnot get too much the upper hand) the satiric skill are very nearly\r\nfirst-rate. And, with the cautions and admissions just given, there is\r\nnot a little in the purpose itself, with which one may be permitted to\r\nsympathise. After all \"misters the assassins\" were being allowed very\r\ngenerous \"law,\" and it was time for other people to \"begin.\" As for\r\nFeuillet's opposition to the \"modern spirit,\" which was early denounced,\r\nit is not necessary--even for any one who knows that this modern spirit\r\nis only an old enemy with a new face, or who, when he sees the statement\r\nthat \"Nothing is ever going anywhere to be the same,\" chuckles, and,\r\nremembering all history to the present minute, mutters, \"Everything\r\nalways has been, is, and always will be the same\"--to call in these\r\nknowledges of his to the rescue of Feuillet's position as a novelist.\r\nThat position is made sure, and would have been made sure if he had been\r\nas much of a Naturalist as he was the reverse, by his power of\r\nconstructing interesting stories; of drawing, if not absolutely perfect,\r\npassable and probable characters; of throwing in novel-accessories with\r\njudgment; and of giving, by dint of manners and talk and other things\r\nnecessary, vivid and true portrayals of the society and life of his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alphonse Daudet and his curious position.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His \"personality.\"]\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no novelist in French literature--or, indeed, in any\r\nother--who, during his lifetime, occupied such a curiously \"mixed\"\r\nposition as Alphonse Daudet.[415] No contemporary of his obtained wider\r\ngeneral popularity, without a touch of irregular bait or of appeal to\r\npopular silliness in it, than he did with _Le Petit Chose_, with the\r\ncharming bundle of pieces called _Lettres de Mon Moulin_, and later with\r\nthe world-delighting burlesque of _Tartarin de Tarascon_. _Jack_ and\r\n_Fromont Jeune et Risler Aîné_ contained more serious advances, which\r\nwere, however, acknowledged as effective by a very large number of\r\nreaders. But he became more and more personally associated with the\r\nNaturalist group of Zola and Edmond de Goncourt; and though he never was\r\nactually \"grimy,\" he had, from a quite early period, when he was\r\nsecretary or clerk to the Duc de Morny, adopted, and more and more\r\nstrenuously persisted in, a kind of \"personal\" novel-writing, which\r\nmight be regarded as tainted with the general Naturalist principle that\r\nnothing is _tacendum_--that private individuality may be made public use\r\nof, to almost any extent. Of course a certain licence in this respect\r\nhas always been allowed to novelists. In the eighteenth century English\r\nwriters of fiction had very little scruple in using and abusing that\r\nlicence, and French, though with the fear of the arbitrary justice or\r\ninjustice of their time and country before them, had almost less. As the\r\nnineteenth went on, the practice by no means disappeared on either side\r\nof the Channel. With us Mr. Disraeli indulged in it largely, and even\r\nThackeray, though he condemned it in others, and was furious when it was\r\nexercised on himself, in journalism if not in fiction, pretty\r\nnotoriously fell into it now and then. As to Dickens, one need not go\r\nbeyond the too notorious instance of Skimpole. Quite a considerable\r\nproportion of Balzac's company are known to have been Balzacified from\r\nthe life; of George Sand's practice it is unnecessary to say more.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His books from this point of view and others.]\r\n\r\nBut none of these is so saturated with personality as Daudet; and while\r\nsome of his \"gentle\" readers seem not to care much about this, even if\r\nthey do not share the partiality of the vulgar herd for it, it disgusts\r\nothers not a little. Morny was not an estimable public or private\r\ncharacter, though if he had been a \"people's man\" not much fault would\r\nprobably have been found with him. I daresay Daudet, when in his\r\nservice, was not overpaid, or treated with any particular private\r\nconfidence. But still I doubt whether any gentleman could have written\r\n_Le Nabab_. The last Bourbon King of Naples was not hedged with much\r\ndivinity; but it is hardly a question, with some, that his _déchéance_,\r\nnot less than that of his nobler spouse, should have protected them from\r\nthe catch-penny vulgarity of _Les Rois en Exil_. Gambetta was not the\r\nworst of demagogues; there was something in him of Danton, and one might\r\nfind more recent analogies without confining the researches to France.\r\nBut even if his weaknesses gave a handle, which his merits could not\r\nsave from the grasp of the vulgariser, _Numa Roumestan_ bore the style\r\nof a vulture who stoops upon recent corpses, not that of a dispassionate\r\ninvestigator of an interesting character made accessible by length of\r\ntime. _L'Évangéliste_ had at least the excuse that the Salvation Army\r\nwas fair game; and that, if there was personal satire, it was not\r\nnecessarily obvious--a palliation which (not to mention another for a\r\nmoment) extends to _Sapho_. But _L'Immortel_ revived--unfortunately, as\r\na sort of last word--the ugliness of this besetting sin of Daudet's.\r\nEven the saner members of Academies would probably scout the idea of\r\ntheir being sacrosanct and immune from criticism. But _L'Immortel_,\r\ndespite its author's cleverness, is once more an essentially vulgar\r\nbook, and a vulturine or ghoulish one--fixing on the wounds and the\r\nbruises and the putrefying sores of its subject--dragging out of his\r\ngrave, for posthumous crucifixion, a harmless enough pedant of not very\r\nold time; and throwing dirty missiles at living magnates. It is one of\r\nthe books--unfortunately not its author's only contribution to the\r\nlist--which leave a bad taste in the mouth, a \"flavour of poisonous\r\nbrass and metal sick.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His \"plagiarisms.\"]\r\n\r\nOf another charge brought against Daudet I should make much shorter\r\nwork; and, without absolutely clearing him of it, dismiss it as, though\r\nnot unfounded, comparatively unimportant. It is that of\r\nplagiarism--plagiarism not from any French writer, but from Dickens and\r\nThackeray. As to the last, one scene in _Fromont Jeune et Risler Aîné_\r\nsimply _must_ be \"lifted\" from the famous culmination of _Vanity Fair_,\r\nwhen Rawdon Crawley returns from prison and catches Lord Steyne with his\r\nwife. But, beyond registering the fact, I do not know that we need do\r\nmuch more with it. In regard to Dickens, the resemblance is more\r\npervading, but more problematical. \"Boz\" had been earlier, and has been\r\nalways, popular in France. _L'excentricité anglaise_ warranted, if it\r\ndid not quite make intelligible, his extravaganza; his semi-republican\r\nsentimentalism suited one side of the French temperament, etc. etc.\r\nMoreover, Daudet had actually, in his own youth, passed through\r\nexperiences not entirely unlike those of David Copperfield and Charles\r\nDickens himself, while perhaps the records of the elder novelist were\r\nnot unknown to the younger. In judging men of letters as shown in their\r\nworks, however, a sort of \"_cadi_-justice\"--a counter-valuation of\r\nmerits and faults--is allowable. I cannot forgive Daudet his inveterate\r\npersonality: I can bid him sit down quickly and write off his\r\nplagiarism--or most of it--without feeling the withers of my judicial\r\nconscience in the very least wrung. For if he did not, as others have\r\ndone, make what he stole entirely his own, he had, _of_ his own, very\r\nconsiderable property in rather unusually various kinds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His merits.]\r\n\r\nThe charm of his short Tales, whether in the _Lettres de Mon Moulin_ or\r\nin collections assuming the definite title, is undeniable. The\r\nsatiric-pathetic--a not very common and very difficult kind--has few\r\nbetter representatives than _La Chèvre de M. Séguin_, and the purely\r\ncomic stories are thoroughly \"rejoicing.\" _Tartarin_, in his original\r\nappearances, \"touches the spot,\" \"carries off all the point\" in a manner\r\nsuggestive at once of Horace and Homocea; and though, as was almost\r\ninevitable, its sequels are less effective, one would have been very\r\nglad indeed of them if they had had no forerunner. In almost all the\r\nbooks--_Robert Helmont_, by the way, though not yet mentioned, has some\r\nstrong partisans--the grip of actual modern society, which is the boast\r\nof the later, as opposed to the earlier, nineteenth-century novel,\r\ncannot be missed. Even those who are most disgusted by the personalities\r\ncannot deny the power of the satiric presentation from _Le Nabab_ to\r\n_Numa Roumestan_. _Fromont Jeune et Risler Aîné_ is, quite independently\r\nof the definite borrowing from us, more like an English novel, in some\r\nrespects, than almost any other French one known to me up to its date;\r\nand I have found persons, not in the least sentimentalists and very\r\nwidely read in novels both English and French, who were absolutely\r\nenthusiastic about _Jack_.\r\n\r\n_L'Évangéliste_ is perhaps the nearest approach to a failure, the\r\natmosphere being too alien from anything French to be favourable to the\r\ndevelopment of a good story, and perhaps the very subject being unsuited\r\nto anything, either English or French, but an episode. In more congenial\r\nmatter, as in the remark in _Numa Roumestan_ as to the peculiar kind of\r\nunholy pleasure which a man may enjoy when he sees his wife and his\r\nmistress kissing each other, Daudet sometimes showed cynic acumen nearer\r\nto La Rochefoucauld than to Laclos, and worthy of Beyle at his very\r\nbest. And I have no shame in avowing real admiration for _Sapho_. It\r\ndoes not by any means confound itself with the numerous studies of the\r\ninfatuation of strange women which French fiction contains; and it is\r\nalmost a sufficient tribute to its power to say that it does not, as\r\nalmost all the rest do, at once serve itself heir to, and enter into\r\nhopeless competition with, _Manon Lescaut_. Nor is the heroine in the\r\nleast like either Marguerite Gautier or Iza Clémenceau, while the\r\ncomparison with Nana, whose class she also shares, vindicates her\r\nindividuality most importantly of all these trials. She seems to me\r\nDaudet's best single figure: though the book is of too specialised a\r\nkind to be called exactly his best book.\r\n\r\nHe never had strong health, and broke down early, so that his total\r\nproduction is decidedly smaller than that of most of his fellows.[416]\r\nNor has he, I think, any pretensions to be considered a novelist of the\r\nvery first class, even putting bulk out of the question. But he can be\r\nboth extremely amusing and really pathetic; he is never unnatural; and\r\nif there is less to be said about him than about some others, it is\r\ncertainly not because he is less good to read. On the contrary, he is so\r\neasy and so good to read, and he has been read so much, that elaborate\r\ndiscussion of him is specially superfluous. It is almost a pity that he\r\nwas not born ten or fifteen years earlier, so that he might have had\r\nmore chance of hitting a strictly distinct style. As it is, with all his\r\npathos and all his fun, you feel that he is of the _Epigoni_ a successor\r\nof more than one or two Alexanders, that he has a whole library of\r\nmodern fiction behind--and, in more than one sense of the word,\r\nbefore--him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: About: _Le Roi des Montagnes_.]\r\n\r\nThere was a time when Englishmen of worth and Englishwomen of grace\r\nthought a good deal of Edmond About. Possibly this was because he was\r\none of the pillars of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_. Far be it from me to\r\nspeak with the slightest disrespect of that famous periodical, to which\r\nI have myself divers indebtednesses, and which has, in the last hundred\r\nyears or thereabouts, harboured and fostered many of the greatest\r\nwriters of France and much of her best literary work. But persons of\r\nsome age and some memory must remember a time in England when it used to\r\nbe \"mentioned with _hor_\" as Policeman X mentioned something or somebody\r\nelse about the same date or a little earlier. Even Matthew Arnold, in\r\nwhose comely head the bump of Veneration was not the most remarkable\r\nprotuberance, used to point to it--as something far above _us_--to be\r\nregarded with reverence and striven towards with might and main. What\r\njustification there might be for this in general we need not now\r\nconsider; but at any rate About has never seemed to the present\r\nhistorian very much of a pillar of anything. His chief generally\r\naccepted titles to the position in novel-writing are, I suppose, _Le Roi\r\ndes Montagnes_ and _Tolla_, each of which, and perhaps one other, we may\r\nexamine in some detail, grouping the rest (with one further exception)\r\nmore summarily. They are the better suited for our purpose in that one\r\nis comedy if not farce, and the other a gradually threatening and at\r\nlast accomplished tragedy.\r\n\r\nOf course it would be a very dull or a very curmudgeonly person who\r\nshould fail to see or refuse to acknowledge \"fun\" in the history of\r\nHadji or Hadgi Stavros. The mixture of sense, science, stupidity, and\r\nunconscious humour[417] in the German narrator; the satire on the\r\ntoleration of brigandage by government in Greece (it must be confessed\r\nthat, of all the reductions to the absurd of parliamentary and\r\nconstitutional arrangements in countries unsuited for them, wherein the\r\nlast hundred years have been so prolific, Greece has provided the most\r\nconstant and reversed-sublime examples, as Russia has the most tragic);\r\nthe contrast of amiability and atrocity in the brigands themselves--all\r\nthese provide excellent opportunities, by no means always missed, for\r\nthe display of a sort of anticipated and Gallicised Gilbertianism. Nor\r\nneed the addition of stage Englishness in Mrs. Simons and her brother\r\nand Mary Ann, of stage Americanism in Captain John Harris and his nephew\r\nLobster, spoil the broth.\r\n\r\nBut, to the possibly erroneous taste[418] of the present taster, it does\r\nnot seem to be a consummated _consommé_. To begin with, there is too\r\nmuch of it; it is watered out to over three hundred pages when it might\r\nhave been \"reduced\" with great advantage to one hundred. Nor is this a\r\nmere easy general complaint; it would be perfectly possible to point out\r\nwhere reductions should take place in detail. No one skilled in the use\r\nof the blue pencil could be at a loss where to apply it in the\r\npreliminary matter; in the journey; in the Hadgi's gravely burlesqued\r\ncorrespondence; in the escape of the ladies; in Hermann's too prolonged\r\nyet absurdly ineffective tortures; in the civil war between the King and\r\nhis subjects; in the rather transpontine victory of the two Americans\r\nand the Maltese over both; and, above all, in the Royal Ball, where\r\nEnglish etiquette requires that the rescuer must be duly introduced to\r\nthose he has rescued. Less matter (or rather less talking about matter)\r\nwith more art might have made it a capital thing, especially if certain\r\ntraces of vulgarity, too common in About, were removed together with the\r\nmere superfluities. At any rate, this is how it strikes, and always has\r\nstruck, a younger but now old contemporary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Tolla._]\r\n\r\nThe same fault of _longueurs_ makes itself felt in _Tolla_: and indeed\r\nthe author seems to have been conscious of it, and confesses it in an\r\napologetic _Preface_ to the editions after the first. But this does not\r\nform the chief ground of accusation against it. Nor, certainly, do the\r\nfacts, as summarised in a note, justify any serious charge of\r\nplagiarism,[419] though the celebrated Buloz seems for once to have been\r\nan unwise editor, in objecting to a fuller acknowledgment of\r\nindebtedness on the part of his contributor. A story of this tragical\r\nkind will bear much fuller handling than a comic tale of scarcely more\r\nthan one situation, recounted with a perpetual \"tongue-in-cheek\"\r\naccompaniment.\r\n\r\nBut, from another point of view, the book does justify the drawing of a\r\ngeneral literary moral, that true _données_ are very far from being\r\ncertain blessings--that they are, in fact, _dona Danaorum_--to the\r\nnovelist; that he should not hug the shore of fact, but launch out into\r\nthe ocean of invention. About, in a fashion rather cheerfully recalling\r\nthe boasts of poor Shadwell, who could \"truly say that he had made\r\nit[420] into a play\" and that \"four of the humours were entirely new,\"\r\nassures us that he has invented everything but the main situation, and\r\nwritten everything out of his own head except a few of the letters of\r\nTolla. Some of these added things are good, though one of the author's\r\nbesetting sins may be illustrated by the fact that he gives nearly half\r\na score pages to a retrospective review of the history of a Russian\r\nGeneral's widow and her daughter, when as many lines--or, better still,\r\na line or two of explanation here and there--would be all that the story\r\nrequires.[421] But the \"given\" situation itself is a difficult one to\r\nhandle interestingly: and, in some estimates at any rate, the difficulty\r\nhas not been overcome here. The son--a younger, but still amply endowed\r\nson--of one of the greatest Roman families, compact of Princes and\r\nCardinals, with reminiscences of Venetian dogedom, falls in love, after\r\na half-hearted fashion, with the daughter of another house of somewhat\r\nless, but still old repute, and of fair, though much lesser wealth. By a\r\ngood deal of \"shepherding\" on the part of her family and friends, and\r\n(one is bound to say) some rather \"downright Dunstable\" on her own, he\r\nis made to propose; but _her_ family accepts the demand that the thing\r\nshall, for a time, be kept secret from _his_. Of course no such secrecy\r\nis long possible; and his people, especially a certain wicked\r\ncavaliere-colonel, with the aid of a French Monseigneur and the Russians\r\nabove mentioned, plot to break the thing off, and finally succeed.\r\n\"Lello\" (Manuel) Coromila finds out the plot too late. Tolla dies of a\r\nbroken heart.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me--speaking with the humility which I do not merely affect,\r\nbut really feel on the particular point--that this might make a good\r\nsubject for a play: that in the hands of Shakespeare or Shelley it might\r\nmake a very great one in two different kinds. But--now speaking with\r\nvery much less diffidence--I do not think it a promising one for a\r\nnovel; and, speaking with hardly any at all, I think that it has\r\ncertainly not made a good one here. Shut up into the narrow action of\r\nthe stage; divested of the intervals which make its improbabilities more\r\npalpable; and with the presentation of Lello as a weaker and baser\r\nHamlet, of Tolla as a betrayed Juliet--with all this brought out and\r\nmade urgent by a clever actor and actress, the thing might be made very\r\neffective. Dawdled over in a novel again of three hundred pages, it\r\nloses appeal to the sympathy and constantly starts fresh difficulties\r\nfor the understanding.\r\n\r\nThat a very delightful girl[422] may fall in love with a nincompoop who\r\nis also notoriously a light-of-love, is quite possible: and, no doubt,\r\nis fortunate for the nincompoops, and, after a fashion, good for the\r\ncontinuation of the human race. But, in a novel, you must make the\r\nprocess interesting, and that is not, _me judice_, done here. The\r\nnincompoop, too, is such an utter nincompoop (he is not a villain, nor\r\neven a rascal) that, no comic use being made of his nincompoopery, he is\r\nof no use at all. And though an old and haughty Italian family like the\r\nFeraldis _might_ no doubt in real life--there is nothing that may not\r\nhappen in real life--consent to clandestine engagements of the kind\r\ndescribed, it certainly is one of the possible-improbables which are\r\nfatal, or nearly so, to art. Two or three subordinate characters--the\r\ngood-natured and good-witted Marquis Filippo Trasimeni, the faithful\r\npeasant Menico, Tolla's foster-brother, and even the bad chambermaid\r\nAmarella--have some merit. But twenty of them could not save the book,\r\nwhich, after dawdling till close upon its end, huddles itself up in a\r\nfew pages, chiefly of _récit_, in a singularly inartistic fashion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Germaine._]\r\n\r\n_Germaine_, which has been (speaking under correction) a much less\r\npopular book than either _Le Roi des Montagnes_ or _Tolla_, is perhaps\r\nbetter than either. Except for a very few pages, it does not attempt the\r\nsomewhat cackling irony of the Greek book; and though it ends with one\r\nfailure of a murder, one accomplished ditto, and two more deaths of no\r\nordinary kind, it does not even attempt, as the Italian one does, real\r\ntragedy. But it has a fairly well-knit plot, some attempt at character,\r\nsufficient change of incident and scene, and hardly any _longueurs_.\r\nEven the hinge of the whole, though it presents certain improbabilities,\r\nis not of the brittle and creaking kind reprobated in that of _Tolla_.\r\n\r\nA Neapolitan-Spanish Count of Villanera, whose second title is \"Marquis\r\nof the Mounts of Iron,\" possessed also not only of the bluest of\r\nblood, but of mountains of gold, has fallen in love, after an\r\nhonour-in-dishonour fashion, with the grass-widow of a French naval\r\ncaptain, Honorine Chermidy, and has had a child by her. She is really a\r\nworse Becky Sharp, or a rather cleverer Valérie Marneffe (who perhaps\r\nwas her model[423]), and she forms a cunning plan by which the child may\r\nbe legitimated and she herself, apparently renouncing, will really\r\nsecure a chance of, the countdom, the marquisate, and the mountains of\r\niron and gold. (Of the latter she has got a good share out of her lover\r\nalready.) The plan is that Villanera shall marry some girl (of noble\r\nbirth but feeble health and no fortune), which will, according to French\r\nlaw, effect or at least permit the legitimation of the little Marques de\r\nlas Montes de Hierro--certain further possibilities being left\r\nostensibly to Providence, but, in Madame Chermidy's private intentions,\r\nto the care of quite another Power. The Dowager Countess de\r\nVillanera--rather improbably, but not quite impossibly--accepts this,\r\nbeing, though proud, willing to derogate a little to make sure of an\r\nheir to the House of Villanera with at any rate a portion (the\r\nsceptical would say a rather doubtful portion[424]) of its own blood.\r\n\r\nVillanera himself, though in most ways the soul of honour, accepts this\r\nshady scheme chiefly through blind devotion to his mistress; and it only\r\nremains to find a family whose poverty, if not their will, consents to\r\nsell their daughter. Through the agency of that stock and pet French\r\nnovel-character, a doctor who is very clever, very benevolent, very\r\nsceptical, and not over-scrupulous, the exact material for the mischief\r\nis found. There is an old Duc de la Tour-D'Embleuse, who, half-ruined by\r\nthe original Revolution, has been almost completely so by that of 1830,\r\nhas thrown away what remained, and has become an amiable and adored but\r\nutterly selfish burden on his angelic wife and daughter, the latter of\r\nwhom, like so many of the heroines of the 'fifties, especially in\r\nFrance, is an all but \"given-up\" _poitrinaire_. The price of the\r\nbargain--an \"inscription\" of fifty thousand francs a year in Rentes--is\r\noffered on the very day when the family has come to its last _sou_;\r\naccepted, after short and sham refusal, by the duke; acquiesced in\r\nunselfishly by the mother, who despairs of saving her husband and\r\ndaughter from starvation in any other way; and submitted to by the\r\ndaughter herself in a spirit of martyrdom, strengthened by the certainty\r\nthat it is but for a little while. How the situation works out to an end\r\nof liberal but not excessive poetical justice, the reader may discover\r\nfor himself: the book being, though not a masterpiece, nor even very\r\nhigh in the second rank, quite worth reading. One or two things may be\r\nnoticed. The first is a really clever sketch, the best thing perhaps in\r\nAbout's novel-work, of the peculiar \"naughty-childishness\"[425] which\r\nbelongs to lovely woman, which does not materially affect her charm or\r\neven her usefulness in some ways, but makes her as politically\r\nimpossible in one way as does that \"incapacity for taking more than one\r\nside of a question\" which Lord Halsbury has pointed out, in\r\nanother.[426] The second is the picture, in the later half of the book,\r\nof those Ionian Islands, then still English, the abandonment of which\r\nwas the first of the many blessings conferred by Mr. Gladstone[427] on\r\nhis country, and the possession of which, during the late or any war,\r\nwould have enabled us almost to pique, repique, and capot the attempts\r\nof our enemies in the adjacent Mediterranean regions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Madelon._]\r\n\r\nAll these books, and perhaps one or two others, are about the same\r\nlength--an equality possibly due (as we have seen in English examples on\r\na different scale) to periodical publication. But once, in _Madelon_,\r\nAbout attempted something of much \"longer breath,\" as his countrymen\r\nsay. Here we have nearly six hundred pages instead of three hundred, and\r\neach page (which is a large one) contains at least half as much again as\r\na page of the others. The book is a handsome one, with a title in red\r\nink; and the author says he took three years to write the novel--of\r\ncourse as an avocation from his vocation in journalism. It is difficult\r\nto repress, though probably needless to utter, the most obvious remark\r\non this; but it is not hard to give it another turn. Diderot said (and\r\nthough some people believe him not, I do) that Rousseau originally\r\nintended, in the Dijon prize essay which made his fate and fame, to\r\nargue that science and letters had _improved_ morality, etc.; and that\r\nhe, Diderot, had told Jean Jacques that this was _le pont aux ânes_, and\r\ndetermined him to take the paradoxical side instead. The \"Asses' bridge\"\r\n(_not_ in the Euclidic sense, nor as meaning that all who took it were\r\nasses) of the mid-nineteenth century French novelist was the biography\r\nof the _demi-monde_. Balzac had been the first and greatest engineer of\r\nthese _ponts et chaussées_; Dumas _fils_ had shown that they might lead\r\nto no mean success; so all the others followed in a fashion certainly\r\nrather ovine and occasionally asinine. Madelon is a young woman,\r\nattractive rather than beautiful, who begins as a somewhat mysterious\r\nfavourite of men of fashion in Paris; establishes herself for a time as\r\na married woman in an Alsatian town; ruins nearly, _mais non tout_, a\r\ncountry baron; and ends, as far as the book goes, by being a sort of\r\ninferior Lola Montès to a German princeling. It has cost considerable\r\neffort to justify even this short summary. I have found few French\r\nnovels harder to read. But there is at least one smart remark--of the\r\n\"publicist\" rather than the novelist kind--towards the end:\r\n\r\n     C'est un besoin inné chez les peuplades germaniques; il\r\n     faut, bon gré mal gré, qu'ils adorent quelqu'un.\r\n\r\nThey did not dislike puns and verbal jingles, either in France or in\r\nEngland in the mid-nineteenth century, as much as their ancestors and\r\ntheir descendants in both countries have done before and since. A\r\nsurvivor to-day might annotate \"Et quel quelqu'un quelquefois!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Maître Pierre_, etc. Summing up.]\r\n\r\nIn fact, to put the matter brutally, but honestly, as far as the present\r\nwriter's knowledge extends, Edmond About was not a novelist at all \"in\r\nhis heart.\" He was a journalist (he himself admits the impeachment so\r\nfar), and he was a journalist in a country where novel- or at least\r\ntale-writing had long established itself as part of the journalist's\r\nbusiness. Also he was really a good _raconteur_--a gift which, though\r\nperhaps few people have been good novelists without it, does not by\r\nitself make a good novelist. As a publicist, too, he was of no small\r\nmark: his _Question Romaine_ could not be left out of any sufficient\r\npolitical library of the nineteenth century. Some of his shorter tales,\r\nsuch as _Le Nez d'un Notaire_ and _L'Homme à l'Oreille Cassée_, have had\r\na great vogue with those who like comic situations described with\r\nlively, if not very refined, wit. He was also a good topographer; indeed\r\nthis element enters largely into most of his so-called novels already\r\nnoticed, and constitutes nearly all the interest of a very pleasant book\r\ncalled _Maître Pierre_. This is a description of the _Landes_ between\r\nBordeaux and Arcachon, and something like a \"puff\" of the methods used\r\nto reclaim them, diversified by an agreeable enough romance. The hero is\r\na local \"king,\" a foundling-hunter-agriculturist who uses his kingdom,\r\nnot like Hadji Stavros, to pillage and torment, but to benefit his\r\nsubjects. The heroine is his protégée Marinette, a sort of minor Isopel\r\nBerners, with a happier end.[428] The throwing into actual tale-form of\r\ncurious and decidedly costly local fashions of courtship is clever; but\r\nthe whole thing is a sort of glorified advertisement. Other books, _Les\r\nMariages de Paris_ and _Les Mariages de Province_, almost tell their\r\ntales, and something more,[429] in their titles.\r\n\r\nOne cannot but be sorry if this seems an unfair or shabby account of a\r\npleasant and popular writer, but the right and duty of historical\r\ncriticism is not to be surrendered. One of the main objects of literary\r\nhistory is to separate what is quotidian from what is not. To neglect\r\nthe quotidian altogether is--whatever some people may say--to fall short\r\nof the historian's duty; to put it in its proper place _is_ that duty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ponson du Terrail and Gaboriau.]\r\n\r\nWhat ought to be said and done about Ponson du Terrail and Gaboriau--the\r\nyounger Sue and Soulié; the protagonists of the melodramatic and\r\ncriminal _feuilleton_ during the later middle of the century--has been\r\nrather a problem with me. Clearly they cannot be altogether neglected.\r\nDeep would answer to deep, Rocambole to M. Lecoq, in protesting against\r\nsuch an omission of their manufacturers. I do not know, indeed, that any\r\nEnglish writer of distinction has done for M. le Vicomte Ponson du\r\nTerrail what Mr. Lang did, \"under the species of eternity\" which verse\r\nconfers, for \"(Miss Braddon and) Gaboriau.\" I have known those who\r\npreferred that _other_ Viscount, \"Richard O'Monroy\"--who shared with\r\n\"Gyp\" and Armand Silvestre the cheerful office of cheering the cheerable\r\nduring the 'eighties and later--to the more canonical possessor of the\r\ntitle before him. But du Terrail was what I believe is called, in\r\nScottish \"kirk\" language, a \"supply\"--a person who could undertake the\r\nduty of filling gaps--of enormous efficacy in his day. That is a claim\r\non this history which cannot be neglected, though the people who would\r\nfain have Martin Tupper blotted out of the history of English poetry,\r\nmight like to drop Ponson du Terrail in that of the French novel down an\r\noubliette, like one of his own heroes, and _not_ give him the file\r\nmercifully furnished to that robustious marquis. Gaboriau claims, in the\r\nsame way, even more \"clamantly.\"\r\n\r\nThe worst of it is (to play cards on table with the strictness which is\r\nthe only virtue of this book, save perhaps an occasional absence of\r\nignorance) that neither of them appeals to me. I have no doubt that this\r\nrecalcitrance to the crime-novel is a _culpa_, if not a _culpa maxima_.\r\nI suppose it was born in me. It is certainly not merely due to the fact\r\nthat, in my journalist days, perhaps because I was a kind of abortion of\r\na barrister, I had to write endless articles on crimes.\r\n\r\n    Penge murders knew\r\n    The pencil blue\r\n\r\nas regards my \"copy,\" and a colleague once upbraided me for arguing in\r\nfavour of Mrs. Maybrick. But I had read crime-novels before those days,\r\nand they never amused me. Yet perhaps it may be possible to show\r\ncause--other than my personal likings--for not ranking these high.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first--his general character.]\r\n\r\nI have somewhere seen it said that Ponson du Terrail, before he took to\r\ndriving _feuilletons_ five-in-hand, showed some power of less coarse\r\nfiction-writing on a smaller scale. But I have not seen any of these\r\nessays, and real success in them on his part would surprise me. For it\r\nis exactly in the qualities necessary to such a success that he seems to\r\nme to come short. He _did_ possess what, though it may seem almost\r\nprofane to call it imagination, is really a cheap and drossy lower kind\r\nthereof. He could frame and accumulate, even to some extent connect,\r\nmelodramatic situations, not so very badly, and not in very glaring\r\nimitation of anybody else. But, perhaps for that very reason, the\r\ndifference between him and the others strikes one all the more\r\npainfully. _Les Orphelins de la Saint-Barthélemy_ awakes the saddest\r\nsighs for Dumas or Mérimée. _La Femme Immortelle_, with its _diablerie_\r\nexplained and then _dis_-explained and then clumsily solved with a\r\nlaugh, makes one wish for an hour or two even of Soulié. And when one\r\ncomes to the nineteenth century and _Les Gandins_ and a fiendish\r\n_docteur rouge_[430] (who is in every conceivable way inferior to\r\nVigny's _docteur noir_), and a wicked count who undergoes a spotty\r\ntranscorporation, it is worse. If any one says, \"This is possible, but\r\nyou yourself have said that excellence in some one else ought not to\r\naffect the estimate of the actual subject,\" I reply, \"Granted; but\r\nPonson du Terrail bores me.\" I have dropped every book of his that I\r\nhave taken up, and only at a second--even a third--struggle have been\r\nable to get knowledge enough of it to speak without critical treason.\r\nMoreover, his style (always under caution given) seems to me flat,\r\nsavourless, and commonplace; his thought childish, his etceteras (if I\r\nmay so say) absurd. The very printing is an irritation. Who can read\r\nsuch stuff as this?\r\n\r\n     Tout à coup une sonnette se fit entendre.\r\n\r\n     Nana se leva.\r\n\r\n     Cette sonnette état celle qui avertissait la soubrette que\r\n     sa maîtresse réclamait son office.\r\n\r\n     La jolie fille prit un flambeau et quitta la cuisine.\r\n\r\nHere you have four separate paragraphs, five lines, and thirty-five\r\nwords to express, in almost idiotic verbiage, the following:\r\n\r\n\"Here her mistress's bell rang, and she left the kitchen.\"\r\n\r\nOne might conduct not merely five, but five and twenty novels abreast at\r\nthis rate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The second.]\r\n\r\nNot thus would it be proper to write of Gaboriau. With him, except\r\nincidentally, and when he is diverging from his proper line,[431] one\r\nfinds no mere \"piffle.\" He has a business and he does that. Moreover, it\r\nis a business which, if not intrinsically, is historically important. Of\r\ncourse there had been crime-novels and crime-tales before: there always\r\nhas been everything before. But Gaboriau undoubtedly refashioned and\r\nrestarted them, and has been ever since the parent or master of a\r\nfamily, or whole school, of novelists and tale-tellers who have\r\nsometimes seemed, at any rate to themselves, to be pillars, and to be\r\nentitled to talk about politics and religion and morals, and the other\r\nthings which, as Chesterfield so delightfully remarked, need no\r\ntroublesome preparation in the talker. His place here, therefore, is\r\nsecured. If it is not a large place, that is not entirely due to the\r\nmere fact that, as has been frankly acknowledged, the present writer\r\ntakes little pleasure in the crime-novel. It is because the kind,\r\nplentiful for those who like it to read, can be conveniently knocked off\r\nin specimen for others. For the latter purpose it would not matter very\r\nmuch whether _L'Affaire Lerouge_, or _Le Crime d'Orcival_, or _M. Lecoq_\r\nitself, or perhaps even others, were taken. The first named, which was,\r\nI think, one of the first, if not the actual overture of the series, and\r\nwhich happens to be best known to the historian, will perhaps suffice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _L'Affaire Lerouge._]\r\n\r\nNo one who takes it up, having some little critical aptitude and\r\nexperience, will fail to see, very shortly, that it does mean business\r\nand does do it. The murder of Claudine Lerouge is well plunged into; the\r\narrangements for its detection--professional and amateur--are\r\n\"gnostically\" laid out; and the plot thickens and presents various sides\r\nof itself, like a craftsmanly made and tossed pancake. If you read it at\r\nall, you will not skip much; first, because the interest, such as it is,\r\nis continuous; and, secondly, for one of those reasons which keep\r\nwould-be sinners in other paths of rectitude--that, _if_ you skip, you\r\nwill almost certainly find you have lost your way when you come down\r\nfrom skipping. Some oddities--partly, but not entirely, connected with\r\nthe strange and well-known differences between French and English\r\ncriminal procedure--will, of course, strike an Englishman--the\r\ncollaboration of professional _juge d'instruction_ and amateur detective\r\nbeing perhaps the most remarkable. The love-affair, in which the Judge\r\nhimself and the plotted-against Albert de Commarin are rivals, though a\r\nuseful poker to stir the fire, is not quite a well-managed one: and the\r\nlong harangue of Madame Gerdy, between her resurrection from brain-fever\r\nand her death, seems a little to strain probability. But no one of these\r\nthings, nor all together, need be fatal to the enjoyment of the book on\r\nthe part of, as was once said, \"them as likes\" the kind.[432]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Feydeau--_Sylvie_.]\r\n\r\nShort notice may again serve for another novelist enormously popular in\r\nhis day; very characteristic of the Second Empire; a favourite[433] for\r\na time (rather inexplicably) of Sainte-Beuve; but not much of a rose,\r\nand very much of many days before yesterday--Ernest Feydeau. He did one\r\nthing, _Sylvie_, as different as possible from Gérard's book of the same\r\nname, but still, as it seems to me, good enough, though it never enjoyed\r\na tenth part of the popularity of his more \"scabrous\" things, though\r\nitself is very far from prudish, and though it makes no appearance in\r\nsome lists and collections of his work. Feydeau (it is a redeeming\r\npoint) was one of \"those about\" Gautier, and _Sylvie_ is by no means\r\nunlike a pretty free and fairly original transfer from _Les\r\nJeune-France_. The hero is a gentleman, decadent by anticipation and\r\nromantic by survival to the very _n_th. He abides in a vast chamber,\r\ndivanned, and hung with Oriental curtains: he smokes endless tchibouks,\r\nand lives chiefly upon preserved ginger. To him enters Sylvie, a sort of\r\nguardian angel, with a rather Mahometan angelism, who devotes herself to\r\nhim, and succeeds, by this means and that, in converting him to a\r\nsomewhat more rational system of life and \"tonvelsasens,\" as Swift would\r\nsay. It is slight enough, but very far from contemptible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fanny._]\r\n\r\nAs has been said or hinted, however, this was not at all the sort of\r\nthing that brought or, so long as he did keep it, kept Feydeau's vogue.\r\n_Fanny_, with which he \"broke out\" considerably more than \"ten thousand\r\nstrong,\" as far as sale of copies went, is certainly not a book of the\r\n\"first-you-meet\" kind. There is some real passion in its handling of the\r\neverlasting triangle. But it is passion of the most morbid and least\r\n\"infinite\" kind possible. Whenever Feydeau's heroes are sincere they\r\nhave a peculiar kind of sentimental immorality--a sort of greasy\r\ngush--which is curiously nauseous. His Aphrodite, if the goddess will\r\npardon the profanation of her name, is neither laughter-loving, nor\r\ntragic (as Aphrodite can be), nor Uranian in the sense, not of being\r\nsuperior to physical passion, but of transcending it. She is not\r\nexactly Pandemic, for Feydeau, like Malvolio, does talk, or tries to\r\ntalk, of ladies; but she is something like the patroness of the old\r\nSensibility novel \"gone to the bad.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Others--_Daniel_.]\r\n\r\n_Madame de Chalis_, according to a memory of many years which I have not\r\nthought it worth while to freshen, has a weaker draught of this rancid\r\nand mawkish sentimentality. But having in those days missed (or failed\r\nover) _Daniel_, I thought it incumbent on me to gird myself up to its\r\neight hundred pages. A more dismal book, even to skim, I have seldom\r\ntaken up. The hero--a prig of the first water--marries one of those\r\napparently only half-flesh-and-blood wives who, novelistically, never\r\nfail to go wrong. He cannot, in the then state of French law, divorce\r\nher, but he is able to return her on her mother's hands. Going to\r\nTrouville (about which, then a quite new-fashioned resort, there is a\r\ngreat deal in the book), he meets a beautiful girl, Louise de Grandmont,\r\nand the pair fall--not merely hopelessly, which is, in the\r\ncircumstances, a matter of course, but, it would seem, innocently--in\r\nlove with each other. But in such a case scandal must needs come; and it\r\nis engineered by revenge of the discarded wife and the mother-in-law, by\r\nthe treachery of some of Daniel's friends and the folly of others, as\r\nwell as, it must be added, by his own weak violence, thoughtless\r\nconduct, and general imbecility. All this is developed at enormous\r\nlength, and it ends in a general massacre, Louise's uncle being killed\r\nin a duel which Daniel ought to have fought (he is no coward, but a\r\nhopeless blunderer), the girl herself dying of aneurism, and Daniel\r\nputting an end to himself in her grave, much more messily and to quite\r\ninfinitely less tragic effect than Romeo. There is one scene in which he\r\nis represented as gathering all his enemies together (including a\r\nlawyer, who is half-rogue, half-dupe) and putting them all to confusion\r\nby his oratory. The worst of it is that one does not in the least see\r\n_why_ they were confused, except in one case, where the foe is literally\r\nkicked downstairs--an effective method, and one rare enough in French\r\nnovels up to this date to be worth notice.[434]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Droz.]\r\n\r\nIt was, for all contemporary readers of the French novel, except those\r\nof the gravest and most precise kind, a day to be marked, not with\r\nvanishing forms in chalk, but with alabaster or Parian, when \"Marcellin\"\r\nof the _Vie Parisienne_--one of those remarkable editors who, without\r\never writing themselves, seem to have the knack of attracting and almost\r\ncreating writers, enlisted one \"Z,\" the actual final letter of the name\r\nof Gustave Droz, and published the first article of those to be later\r\ncollected as _Monsieur, Madame et Bébé_ and _Entre Nous_. Although the\r\ncontents of these books only added a fresh sprout to the age-old tree\r\nthat, for more than half a millennium, had borne _fabliau_ and\r\n_nouvelle_ and _conte_ and _histoire_, and so forth, they had a\r\nremarkable, if not easily definable, differentia of their own, and have\r\ninfluenced fiction-writing of the same kind for a good half-century\r\nsince. The later-working \"Gyp\" and others owed a good deal to them; and\r\nI am bound to say that--reading the two books recently after a long\r\ninterval--I found my old favourites just as amusing as I found them the\r\nvery first time, shortly after they came out.\r\n\r\nOf course--and only those who have made much study of criticism know how\r\nseldom critics recognise this \"of course\"--you must take the things in,\r\nand not out of, their own class. They are not bread, or meat, or milk of\r\nliterature. They are, to take one order of gastronomic preference and\r\ntaste, devilled biscuits; to take another, chocolate with whipped cream\r\non it. And the devilling and the creaming are sometimes better than the\r\nchocolate and the biscuit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mr., Mme. et Bébé_ and _Entre Nous_.]\r\n\r\nIt is not very easy to say--and perhaps not very important to\r\nknow--whether the mixture of naughtiness and sentimentality which\r\ncharacterises these books[435] was what Mr. Carlyle, I think, was first\r\nto call an \"insurance\" or only a spontaneous and in no way \"dodgy\" or\r\n\"hedgy\" expression of the two sides of the French character. For\r\neverybody ought to know that the complaint of Dickens's \"Mr. the\r\nEnglishman\" as to the French being \"so d--d sentimental\" is at least as\r\nwell justified as Mr. Arnold's disapproval of their \"worship of\r\nLubricity.\" I suppose there are some people who would prefer the\r\nsentiment and are others who would choose the \"tum-te-dy,\" while yet a\r\nthird set might find each a disagreeable alternative to the other. For\r\nmyself, without considering so curiously, I can very frankly enjoy the\r\nbest of both. The opening story of the earlier and, I think, more\r\npopular book, \"Mon Premier Reveillon,\" is not characteristic. It might\r\nhave been written by almost anybody, and is in substance a softened and\r\ngenteel version of the story of Miss Jemima Ivins, and her luckless (but\r\nthere virtuous) suitor, in the \"Boz\" _Sketches_. \"L'Âme en Peine,\" which\r\nfollows, strikes the peculiar Drozian note for the first time; and very\r\npleasant is the painting of the struggles of a pious youth--pious and\r\npudibund to a quite miraculous extent for a French _collégien_ of good\r\nfamily--with the temptations of a beautiful Marquise and cousin who,\r\narrayed in an ultra-Second-Empire bathing-costume, insists on his\r\nbathing with her. \"Tout le Reste de Madame de K.\" may a little remind an\r\nEnglish reader of the venerable chestnut about the Bishop and the\r\nhousemaid's knee; but the application is different. There is nothing\r\nwicked in it, but it contains some of the touches of varying estimate\r\nof \"good form\" in different countries which make the comparative reading\r\nof English and French novels so interesting. \"Souvenirs de Carême\" is\r\n(or rather are, for the piece is subdivided) the longest of several bits\r\nof Voltairianism, sometimes very funny and seldom offensive. But, alas!\r\none cannot go through them all. The most remarkable exercise in the\r\ncurious combination or contrast noticed above is afforded by _Une Nuit\r\nde Noce_ and _Le Cahier Bleu_ (tricks of ingeniously \"passed-off\"\r\nnaughtiness which need not shock anybody), combined with the charming\r\nand pathetic \"Omelette\" which opens the second book, and which gives the\r\nhappy progress and the sad termination of the union so merrily begun.\r\nAll are drawn with equal skill and with no real bad taste. In one or two\r\narticles of both books the _gauloiserie_ broadens and coarsens, while in\r\nthe more purely \"Bébé\" sections of the first the sentimentality may seem\r\na little watered out. But you cannot expect acrobatics on wine-glasses\r\nof this kind always to \"come off\" without some slips and breakages.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I think _Entre Nous_ contains the very best things, and\r\nmost good ones. The pathos of the first (which is itself by no means\r\nmere _pleurnicherie_) is balanced at the other end by the audacity of\r\n\"Le Sentiment à l'Épreuve,\" a most agreeable \"washing white\" of the main\r\nidea of Wycherley's _Country Wife_; and between the two, few in the\r\nwhole score are inferior. \"Nocturne,\" \"Oscar,\" \"Causerie,\" and \"Le\r\nMaillot de Madame\" were once marked for special commendation by a critic\r\nwho certainly deserved the epithet of competent, in addition to those of\r\nfair and gentle. It is, however, in this volume that what seems to me\r\nDroz's one absolute failure occurs. It is neither comic nor tragic,\r\nneither naughty nor nice, and one really wonders how it came to be put\r\nin. It is entitled \"Les de Saint-Paon,\" and is a commonplace, hackneyed,\r\nquite unhumorous, and rather ill-tempered satire on certain dubious\r\naristocrats and anti-modernists. Nothing could be cheaper or less\r\npointed. And the insertion of it is all the stranger because, elsewhere,\r\nthere is something very similar, in subject and tendency, but of half\r\nthe length and ten times the wit, in \"Le Petit Lever,\" a conversation\r\nbetween a certain Count and his valet.\r\n\r\nThe plain critical fact is that the non-pathetic serious was in no way\r\nDroz's trade. His satire on matters ecclesiastical is sometimes\r\ndelightful when it is mere _persiflage_: an Archbishop might relax over\r\nthe conversation in Paradise between two great ladies, one of whom has\r\ncharitably stirred up the efforts of her director in favour of her own\r\ncoachman to such effect, that she actually finds that menial promoted to\r\na much higher sphere Above than that which she herself occupies. But\r\nhere, also, the more gravity the less goodness.\r\n\r\nYet, as was hinted at the beginning of this notice, we ought not to\r\nquarrel with him for this, and to do so would be again to fall into the\r\nold \"gin-shop and leg-of-mutton\" unreasonableness. It was M. Droz's\r\nmission to start a new form of Crébillonade--_panaché_ (to use an\r\nexcellent term of French cookery), here and there, with another new form\r\nof Sensibility. He did it quite admirably, and he taught the simpler\r\ndevice--the compound one hardly--to pupils, some of whom still divert,\r\nor at least distract, the world. I am not at all ashamed to say that I\r\nthink the best of his and their work capital stuff, continuing worthily\r\none of the oldest and most characteristic strains of French literature;\r\ndisplaying no contemptible artistry; and contributing very considerably\r\nto that work of pleasure-giving which has been acknowledged as supplying\r\nthe main subject of this book.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cherbuliez.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His general characteristics.]\r\n\r\nFew more striking contrasts--though we have been able to supply a fair\r\nnumber of such things--could be found than by passing from Gustave Droz\r\nto Victor Cherbuliez. Scion of a Genevese family already distinguished\r\nin letters, M. Cherbuliez became one of the _Deux-Mondains_, a\r\n\"publicist\" as well as a novelist of great ability, and finally an\r\nAcademician; but his novels, clever as they are, were never quite\r\n\"frankly\" liked in France--at least, by the critics. This may have been\r\npartly due to the curious latent grudge with which French writers--to\r\nthe country as well as to the language and manners born--have always\r\nregarded their Swiss comrades or competitors--the attitude as to a kind\r\nof poacher or interloper.[436] But to leave the matter there would be\r\nnot only to miss thoroughness in the individual case, but also to\r\noverlook a point of very considerable importance to the history of the\r\nFrench novel generally. There is undoubtedly something in M.\r\nCherbuliez's numerous, vigorous, and excellently readable novels which\r\nreminds one more of English than of French fiction. We have noticed a\r\ncertain resemblance in Feuillet to Trollope: it is stronger still in\r\nCherbuliez. Not, of course, that the Swiss novelist denies\r\nhimself--though he uses them more sparingly--the usual latitudes of the\r\nFrench as contrasted with the English novelist during nine-tenths of the\r\nnineteenth century. But he does use them more sparingly, and he is apt\r\nto make his heroines out of unmarried girls, to an extent which might at\r\nthat time seem, to the conventional French eye, simply indecent. He is\r\nmuch more prodigal of \"interest\"--that is to say, of incident, accident,\r\noccurrence--than most French novelists who do not affect somewhat\r\nmelodramatic romance. On the other hand, his character-drawing, though\r\nalways efficient, is seldom if ever masterly; and that \"schematisation,\"\r\non which, as is pointed out in various places of this book, French\r\ncritics are apt to insist so much, is not always present. Of actual\r\npassion he has little, and his books are somewhat open to the\r\ncharge--which has been brought against those of so many of our own\r\nsecond-best novelists--that they are somewhat machine-made, or, if that\r\nword be too unkind, are rather works of craft than of art. Yet the work\r\nof a sound craftsman, using good materials, is a great help in life; and\r\na person who wants good story-pastime for a certain number of nights,\r\nwithout possessing a Scheherazade of his own, will find plenty of it in\r\nthe thirty years' novel turn-out of Victor Cherbuliez.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Short survey of his books.]\r\n\r\nHe did not find his way at once, beginning with \"mixed\" novels\r\nof a Germanish kind--art-fiction in _Un Cheval de Phidias_;\r\npsychological-literary matter (Tasso's madness) in _Le Prince Vitale_;\r\npolitico-social subjects in _Le Grand-oeuvre_. But these things, which\r\nhave not often been successes, certainly were not so in M. Cherbuliez's\r\nhands. He broke fresh ground and \"grew\" a real novel in _Le Comte\r\nKostia_, and he continued to till this plot, with good results, for the\r\nrest of his life. The \"scenes and characters\" are sufficiently varied,\r\nthose in the book just mentioned being Russian and those in _Ladislas\r\nBolski_ Polish--neither particularly complimentary to the nationalities\r\nconcerned, and the latter decidedly melodramatic. _Le Comte Kostia_ is\r\nsometimes considered his best novel; but I should put above it both _Le\r\nRoman d'une Honnête Femme_ (his principal attempt in purely French\r\nsociety and on Feuilletesque lines, with a tighter morality) and _Meta\r\nHoldenis_, a story of a Swiss girl--not beautiful, but \"_vurry_\r\nattractive,\" and not actually \"no better than she should be,\" but quite\r\nready to be so if it suited her. _Miss Rovel_ with another\r\ngirl-heroine--eccentric, but not in the lines of the usual\r\nFrench-English caricatures--is a great favourite with some. _La Revanche\r\nde Joseph Noirel_ is again melodramatic; and _Prosper Randoce_ is not\r\ngood for much. But _Paule Méré_, one of its author's best\r\ncharacter-books, is very much better--it is a study of ill-starred love,\r\nas is _Le Fiancé de Mlle. Saint-Maur_, a book not so good, but not bad.\r\n_Samuel Brohl et Cie_ is a very clever story of a rascal. I do not know\r\nthat any of his subsequent novels, _L'Idée de Jean Téterol_, _Noirs et\r\nRouges_, _La Ferme du Choquard_, _Olivier Maugant_, _La Vocation du\r\nComte Ghislain_, _La Bête_, _Une Gageure_, which closes the list of my\r\nacquaintance with them, will disappoint the reader who does not raise\r\nhis expectation too high. _Olivier Maugant_ is perhaps the strongest.\r\nBut the expression just used must not be taken as belittling. In both\r\nFrance and England such novel-writing had become almost a\r\ntrade--certainly a profession: and the turning out of workmanlike and\r\nfairly satisfying articles for daily consumption is, if not a noble\r\nambition, a quite respectable aim. M. Cherbuliez did something more than\r\nthis: there are numerous scenes and situations in his work which do not\r\nmerely interest, but excite, if they never exactly transport. And the\r\nprovision of interest itself is, as has been allowed, remarkably\r\nbounteous. I should not despise, though I should be a little sorry for,\r\na reader--especially an English reader--who found more of it in\r\nCherbuliez than even in Feuillet, and much more than in Flaubert or\r\nMaupassant. The causes of such preference require no extensive\r\nindication, and I need not say, after or before what is said elsewhere,\r\nthat this order of estimate is not mine. But it is to some extent a\r\n\"fact in the case.\"[437]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Three eccentrics.]\r\n\r\nBefore finishing this chapter we ought, perhaps, to consider three odd\r\npersons, two of them much extolled by some--Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly,\r\nLéon Cladel, and \"Champfleury\" of _Les Excentriques_. The two first were\r\nthemselves emphatically \"eccentrics\"--one an apostle of dandyism (he\r\nactually wrote a book about Brummel, whom he had met early), a\r\ndisdainful critic of rather untrustworthy vigour, and a stalwart\r\nreactionary to Catholicism and Royalism; the other a devotee of the\r\nexact opposite of dandyism, as the title of his best-known book, _Les\r\nVa-nu-pieds_, shows, and a Republican to the point of admiring the\r\nCommune. The opposition has at least the advantage of disproving\r\nprejudice, in any unfavourable remarks that may be made about either. To\r\nBarbey d'Aurevilly's criticism I have endeavoured to do justice in a\r\nmore appropriate place than this.[438] His fiction occupied a much\r\nsmaller, but not a small, proportion of his very voluminous work. _Les\r\nDiaboliques_ and _L'Ensorcelée_, as well as _Les Va-nu-pieds_, are\r\ntitles which entitle a reader to form certain more or less definite\r\nexpectations about the books they label; and an author, by choosing\r\nthem, deprives himself, to some extent, of the right justly claimed for\r\nhim in Victor Hugo's well-known manifesto, to be judged _merely_\r\naccording to his own scheme, and the goodness or badness of its carrying\r\nout. If Hugo himself had made _Les Orientales_ studies of Montmartre and\r\nthe Palais Royal, he could not have made out his right to the privilege\r\nhe asserted. The objection applies to Barbey d'Aurevilly even more than\r\nto Cladel, but as the work of the latter is the less important, we may\r\ntake it first.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Léon Cladel--_Les Va-nu-pieds_, etc.]\r\n\r\nAt more times in my life than one I have striven to like--or at any rate\r\nto take an interest in--_Les Va-nu-pieds_. Long ago it had for me the\r\npassport of the admiration of Baudelaire,[439] to whom and to Victor\r\nHugo (this latter circumstance an important _visa_ to the former) Cladel\r\nannounced himself a pupil. But an absolute, if perhaps unfortunate,\r\ninability to follow anything but my own genuine opinion prevented me\r\nfrom enjoying it. And I cannot enjoy it now. It is not a commonplace\r\nbook, nor is anything else of its author's; but the price paid for the\r\nabsence of commonplaceness is excessive. A person possessing genius, and\r\nsure of it, does not tell you that he has been rewriting his book (not\r\nfor correction of fact, but for improvement of style) for ten years, and\r\nthat now he doesn't care anything for critics, and endorses it NE\r\nVARIETUR (_sic_).[440] The style itself is a mosaic of preciousness,\r\nliterary jargon, and positive _argot_--not quite contemptible, but, like\r\nsome actual mosaic, unattractive; and the matter does not attract me,\r\nthough it may attract people who like tiger-taming scenes, crimes,\r\ngrimes, etc. The address of the dedication, \"Mienne,\" and nothing more,\r\nis rather nice, and some of the local scenes (Cladel was passionately\r\npatriotic towards his remote province of Quercy-Rouergue) are worth\r\nreading. But this devotion is better shown in the short single book\r\n(_Les Va-nu-pieds_ is a collection) called _Crête-Rouge_--the regimental\r\nnickname of the heroine (an Amazon), who actually serves in the war of\r\nthe Terrible Year, and comes off much better, when her sex is discovered\r\nby the Prussians, than she would have done forty and odd years later.\r\nThe end-scenes of this book, with her Druid-stone marriage to a comrade,\r\nare really good. Of _Le Bouscassié_, _Titi-Froissac IV_, and _La Fête\r\nVotive de Saint-Bartholomée Porte-Glaive_ I shall not say much. The\r\n\"province,\" which is strong in them, saves them sometimes. But Cladel's\r\nhopeless lack of self-criticism shows itself in the fact of his actually\r\nreprinting in full an article of Veuillot's (by no means\r\nuncomplimentary) on himself, as a prelude in the book last mentioned,\r\nand adding a long reply. The proceeding was honest, but rather suicidal.\r\nOne may not wholly admire the famous editor of the _Univers_.[441] But\r\nnothing could better throw up his clear, vigorous, classical French and\r\ntrenchant logic, than the verbose and ambaginous preciousness, and the\r\ncabbage-stick cudgel-play, of Cladel.[442]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Barbey d'Aurevilly--his criticism of novels.]\r\n\r\nJules Barbey d'Aurevilly, also a favourite of Baudelaire's, is a writer\r\nof an altogether greater clan--indeed one of those who come short but a\r\nlittle, and one does not quite know how, of individual greatness.\r\nSomething has been said of his criticism, but a volume of it which was\r\nnot within my reach when I wrote what is there quoted, _Le Roman\r\nContemporain_, is a closer introduction to a notice of him as a\r\nnovelist. As of all his work it may be said of this, that anybody who\r\ndoes not know the subjects will probably go away with a wrong idea of\r\nthem, but that anybody who does know them will receive some very\r\nvaluable cross-lights. The book consists[443] of a belittlement,\r\nslightly redressed at the end, of Feuillet as a feeble person and an\r\nimpertinent patroniser of religion; of a rather \"magpie\" survey of the\r\nGoncourts; of a violent and quite blind attack on Flaubert (the worst\r\ncriticism of Barbey's that I have ever read); of a somewhat unexpectedly\r\nappreciative notice of Daudet; of an almost obligatory panegyric of\r\nFabre; of another _éreintement_, at great length, of Zola; and of\r\nshorter articles, again \"magpied\" of praise and blame, on MM. Richepin,\r\nCatulle Mendès, and Huysmans.[444]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His novels themselves--_Les Diaboliques_ and others.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His merits.]\r\n\r\nAll this is interesting, but I fear it confirms a variation of the title\r\nof a famous Elizabethan play--\"Novelists beware novelists.\" Poets have a\r\nworse reputation in this way, or course; but, I think, unjustly. Perhaps\r\nthe reason is that the quality of poetry is more _definite_, if not more\r\ndefinable, than that of prose fiction, or else that poets are more\r\nreally sure of themselves. Barbey d'Aurevilly[445] had an apparently\r\nundoubting mind, but perhaps there were unacknowledged doubts, which\r\ntransformed themselves into jealousies, in his heart of hearts. For\r\nmyself, I sympathise with his political and religious (if not exactly\r\nwith his ecclesiastical) views pretty decidedly; I think (speaking as\r\nusual with the due hesitation of a foreigner) that he writes excellent\r\nFrench; and I am sure--a point of some consequence with me, and not too\r\ncommonly met--that he generally writes (when he does not get _too_\r\nangry) like a gentleman. He sometimes has phrases which please me very\r\nmuch, as when he describes two lovers embracing so long that they \"must\r\nhave drunk a whole bottle of kisses,\" or when he speaks of the voice of\r\na preacher \"_tombant_ de la chaire dans cette église où _pleuvaient_ les\r\nténèbres du soir,\" where the opposition-combination of \"tombant\" and\r\n\"pleuvaient,\" and the image it arouses, seem to me of a most absolute\r\nfancy. He can write scenes--the finale of his best book, _L'Ensorcelée_;\r\nthe overture of _Un Prêtre Marié_; and nearly the whole of the last and\r\nbest _Diabolique_, \"Une Vengeance de Femme\"--which very closely approach\r\nthe first class. And, whether he meant me to do so or not, I like him\r\nwhen in \"Un Dîner d'Athées\" he makes one of them \"swig off\" (_lamper_) a\r\nbumper of Picardan, the one wine in all my experience which I should\r\nconsider fit _only_ for an atheist.[446] But a good novelist I cannot\r\nhold him.\r\n\r\nThe inability does not come from any mere \"unpleasantness\" in his\r\nsubjects, though few pleasant ones seem to have lain in his way, and he\r\ncertainly did not go out of that way to find them. But _L'Ensorcelée_\r\ncan only be objected to on this score by an absurdly fastidious person,\r\nand I do not myself want any more rose-pink and sky-blue in _Un Prêtre\r\nMarié_;[447] while the last _Diabolique_, already mentioned, is a\r\ncapital example of grime made more than tolerable.[448] Indeed, nothing\r\nof the sort can be more unmistakable than the sincerity of Barbey's\r\n\"horrors.\" They mark, in that respect, nearly the apex of the triangle,\r\nthe almost disappearing lower angles of which may be said to be\r\nrepresented by the crude and clumsy vulgarities of Janin's _Âne Mort_,\r\nand the more craftsmanlike, indeed in a way almost artistic, but\r\nunconvinced and unconvincing atrocities of Borel's _Champavert_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And defects.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Especially as shown in _L'Ensorcelée_.]\r\n\r\nThe objection, and the defect which occasions the objection, are quite\r\ndifferent. Barbey d'Aurevilly has many gifts and some excellencies. But\r\nhis work in novel constantly reminds me of the old and doubtless\r\nwell-known story of a marriage which was almost ideally perfect in all\r\nrespects but one--that the girl \"couldna bide her man.\" He can do many\r\nthings, but he cannot or will not tell a story, save in such fragments\r\nand flashes as those noted above. His _longueurs_ are exasperating and\r\nsometimes nearly maddening, though perhaps many readers would save\r\nthemselves by simply discontinuing perusal. The first _Diabolique_ has\r\nmetal attractive enough of its kind. A young officer boards with a\r\nprovincial family, where the beautiful but at first silent, abstracted,\r\nand, as the Pléiade would have said, _marbrine_ daughter suddenly,\r\nthough secretly, develops frantic affection for him, and shows it by\r\nconstant indulgence in the practice which that abominable cad in\r\nOphelia's song put forward as an excuse for not \"wedding.\" But, on one\r\nof these occasions, she translates trivial metaphor into ghastly fact by\r\nliterally dying in his arms. Better stuff--again of its kind--for a\r\ntwenty-page story, or a little more, could hardly be found. But Barbey\r\ngives us _ninety_, not indeed large, but, in the usual editions, of\r\nexceptionally close and small print, watering out the tale intolerably\r\nalmost throughout, and giving it a blunt and maimed conclusion. _Le\r\nBonheur dans le Crime_,[449] _Le Dessous de Cartes_, and the\r\nabove-mentioned _Dîner d'Athées_, which fill a quarter of a thousand of\r\nsuch pages, invite slashing with a hook desperate enough to cut each\r\ndown to a quarter of a hundred. _Un Prêtre Marié_, which perhaps comes\r\nnext to _L'Ensorcelée_ in merit, would be enormously improved by being\r\nin one volume instead of two. Of _Une Vieille Maîtresse_ I think I could\r\nspare both, except a vigorously told variant (the suggestion is\r\nacknowledged, for Barbey d'Aurevilly was much too proud to steal) of\r\nBuckingham's duel[450] and the Countess (not \"Duchess,\" by the way) of\r\nShrewsbury. _Une Histoire sans Nom_, a substantial though not a very\r\nlong book, is only a short story spun out. Even in _L'Ensorcelée_ itself\r\nthe author, as a critic, might, and probably would, have found serious\r\nfault, had it been the work of another novelist. There is less\r\nsurplusage and more continuous power, so that one is carried through\r\nfrom the fine opening on the desolate moor (a _little_ suggested,\r\nperhaps, by the meeting of Harry Bertram and Dandie Dinmont, but quite\r\nindependently worked out) to the vigorous close above referred to. But\r\nthe story is quite unnecessarily muddled by information that part of it\r\nwas supplied by the Norman Mr. Dinmont, and part by an ancient countess.\r\nWe never get any clear idea _why_ Jeanne le Hardouey was bewitched, and\r\n_why_ the Chevalier-Abbé de la Croix-Jugan suffered and diffused so\r\ngruesome a fate.[451] Yet the fate itself is enough to make one close,\r\nwith the sweet mouth, remarks on this very singular failure of a genius.\r\nFew things of the sort in fiction are finer than the picture of the\r\nterrible unfinished mass (heralded over the desolate moor at uncertain\r\ntimes by uncanny bell-ringing), which the reprobate priest (who has been\r\nshot at the altar-steps before he could accomplish the Sacrifice of\r\nReconciliation[452]) endeavours after his death to complete, being\r\nalways baffled before the consecrating moment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Champfleury.]\r\n\r\nCladel had a considerable, and Barbey d'Aurevilly an almost exclusive,\r\nfancy for the tragical. On the other hand, Champfleury (who, no doubt\r\npartly for a bibliographical memory,[453] prefixed the Champ- to his\r\nactual surname) occupies, as has been said, a curious, but in part far\r\nfrom unsatisfactory, position in regard to our subject, and one blessed\r\nby the Comic Spirit. His confessed fictions are, indeed, not very\r\nsuccessful. To take one volume only, _Madame Eugénio_, the title-story,\r\n_not_ the first in order, but the longest, is most unfortunately, but\r\nfar too accurately, characterised by a phrase towards its end, \"ce\r\n_triste_ récit,\" the adjective, like our \"poor,\" being capable of two\r\ndifferent meanings. _Histoire du Lieutenant Valentin_, on the other\r\nhand--a story of a young soldier, who, leaving Saint-Cyr in\r\ncholera-time, has to go to hospital, and, convalescing pleasantly while\r\nshelling peas and making rose-gays for the Sisters, is naïvely surprised\r\nat one of them being at first very kind and then very cold to him--is a\r\nmiss of a masterpiece, but still a miss, partly owing to too great\r\nlength. And so with others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Les Excentriques._]\r\n\r\nBut in his much earlier _Les Excentriques_ (not unnaturally but wrongly\r\ncalled \"_Contes_ Excentriques\" by some), handling what profess to be\r\ntrue stories, he shows a most excellent narrative faculty. Whether they\r\nare true or not (they rather resemble, and were perhaps inspired by,\r\nsome things of Gautier and Gérard) matters little--they are quite good\r\nenough to be false. They are, necessarily, not quite equal, and there\r\nmay be for some tastes, not for all, too much of the Fourierism and\r\nother queernesses of the mid-nineteenth century. Indeed, the book is of\r\n1852, and its subjects are almost all of the decade preceding. But some\r\nare exceedingly refreshing, the dedication, of some length, to the great\r\ncaricaturist Daumier being not the least so. Yet it is not so unwise as\r\nto disappoint the reader by being better than the text. \"Lucas,\" the\r\ncircle-squarer, who explains how, when he was in a room with a lady and\r\nher two daughters, he perceived that \"this was all that was necessary\r\nfor him to attain the cubation of two pyramids,\" is very choice.\r\n\"Cambriel\"--who not only attained the philosopher's stone and the\r\nuniversal medicine, but ascertained that God is six feet six high, of\r\nflame-coloured complexion, and with particularly perfect ankles--runs\r\nhim hard. And so does Rose Marius Sardat, who sent a copy of his _Loi\r\nd'Union_, a large and nicely printed octavo, to every Parisian\r\nnewspaper-office, informing the editors that they might reprint it in\r\n_feuilletons_ for nothing, but that he should not write the second\r\nvolume unless the first were a success. Some of us ought to be\r\nparticularly obliged to Rose Marius for holding that persons over\r\nseventy are indispensable, and that, if there are not enough in France,\r\nthey must be imported. The difference of this from the callous\r\nshort-sightedness which talks about \"fixed periods\" is most gratifying.\r\nBut perhaps the crown and flower of the book is the vegetarian Jupille,\r\nwho wrote pamphlets addressed:\r\n\r\n    AUX GOURMANDS DE CHAIR!\r\n\r\ndecided that meat is of itself atheistical, though he admitted a \"siren\"\r\nquality about it; and held that the fact of onions making human beings\r\nweep attests their own \"touching sensibility for us\" (albeit he had to\r\nadmit again that garlic was demoniac). M. Jupille (who was a practical\r\nman, and cooked cabbage and cauliflower so that his meat-eating visitor\r\ncould not but acknowledge their charm) explained St. Peter's net of\r\nanimal food with ease as a diabolic deception, but was floored by\r\ncrocodiles' teeth. And not the worst thing in the book is the last,\r\nwhere a waxwork-keeper--a much less respectable person than Mrs. Jarley,\r\nand of the other sex--falls in love with one of his specimens, waltzes\r\nwith her, and unwittingly presents a sort of third companion to one of\r\nthe less saintly kings of the early Graal legends, and to yet another\r\ncharacter of Dickens's, much less well known than Mrs. Jarley, the\r\nhairdresser in _Master Humphrey's Clock_, who, to the disgust of his\r\nfemale acquaintances, \"worshipped a hidle\" in the shape of the turning\r\nbust of a beautiful creature in his own shop-window. The book is a book\r\nto put a man in a good temper--and to keep him in one--for which reason\r\nit affords an excellent colophon to a chapter.[454]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[407] The technical-scholastic being \"things born _with_ a man.\"\r\n\r\n[408] By some curious mistake, his birth used for a long time to be\r\nante-dated ten years from 1822 to 1812. At the risk of annoying my\r\nreaders by repeating such references, I should perhaps mention that\r\nthere is an essay on Feuillet in the book already cited.\r\n\r\n[409] I give Delilah (for whom Milton's excessive rudeness naturally\r\ninspires a sort of partisanship) the benefit of a notion that her action\r\nwas, partly if not mainly, due to unbearable curiosity. How many women\r\nare there who could resist the double temptation of seeing whether the\r\nsecret _did_ lie in the hair, and if so, of possessing complete\r\nmistress-ship of their lovers? Some perhaps: but many?\r\n\r\n[410] _V. sup._ Vol. I. pp. 420-1.\r\n\r\n[411] It may be worth while to remind the reader that Maupassant\r\nincluded this in his selection of remarkable novels of all modern times\r\nand languages.\r\n\r\n[412] How sad it is to think that a specific reference to that\r\nall-but-masterpiece, as a picture of earlier _fin-de-siècle_ society,\r\nMiss Edgeworth's _Belinda_, may perhaps be necessary to escape the\r\ndamning charge of unexplained allusion!\r\n\r\n[413]\r\n\r\n     \"Where'er I came I brought _calamity_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I read the foolish things that foolish people still write about\r\nTennyson, I like to repeat to myself that \"lonely word\" in its immediate\r\ncontext.\r\n\r\n[414] If you can \"take arms against a sea\" you can, I suppose, make head\r\nagainst a sewer.\r\n\r\n[415] His brother Ernest was a novelist of merit sufficient to make it\r\nnot unnatural that he should--as, unless my memory plays me tricks, he\r\ndid--resent being whelmed in the fraternal reputation. But he does not\r\nrequire much notice here.\r\n\r\n[416] I do not call Flaubert \"his fellow,\" or the fellow of any one\r\nnoticed in this chapter, for which reason I kept him out of it.\r\n\r\n[417] It must be remembered that it was long before even 1870. I suppose\r\nsome one, in the mass of war-literature, must have dealt with \"The Ideal\r\nGerman in European Literature between 1815 and 1864.\" If nobody has, an\r\nexcellent subject has been neglected.\r\n\r\n[418] And, according to one reviewer, the deficient sense of humour.\r\n\r\n[419] They _might_ serve to exemplify About's often doubtful taste. The\r\ncentral story and main figures of _Tolla_ were taken from a collection\r\nof the poor girl's letters published by her family a few years before;\r\nand the original of \"Lello\" was still alive. _His_ relations tried to\r\nbuy up the book, and nearly succeeded. In the MS. About had, while\r\nslightly altering the names, referred pretty fully to this document. The\r\nwhole thing has, however, rather a much-ado-about-nothing air and, save\r\nas connected with a periodical of such undoubted \"seriousness,\" might\r\nsuggest a trick.\r\n\r\n[420] \"It\" was _Timon of Athens_.\r\n\r\n[421] It may please the historically given reader to regard this as an\r\nactual survival of the Scudéry _histoire_--_Histoire de Madame Fratieff\r\net de sa fille Nadine_. Only it would, as such, have occupied a score or\r\ntwo of pages for each one.\r\n\r\n[422] Tolla is not so _very_ delightful: but she is meant to be.\r\n\r\n[423] About has a gird or two at Balzac, but evidently imitates him. In\r\nthis very book, when the old duke (_v. inf._) comes under Madame\r\nChermidy's influence, he suggests Baron Hulot; and _Madelon_ (_v. inf.\r\nib._) is almost throughout imitation-Balzacian.\r\n\r\n[424] For Honorine, though managing to retain some public reputation,\r\nhas long been practically \"unclassed\"; and it is not only her husband's\r\nprofession which has made him leave her.\r\n\r\n[425] Germaine, quite naturally and properly, starts with a strong\r\ndislike to her husband. When he takes her to Italy, and devotes himself\r\nto the care of her health, this changes to affection. And the more it\r\nchanges, the more disagreeable she makes herself to him.\r\n\r\n[426] This also has, in matters not political, the \"charming and useful\"\r\nside. It would be very unpleasant if she always saw all sides of all\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n[427] I am quite aware that the giving up of the islands was not the\r\n_immediate_ result of his mission.\r\n\r\n[428] That is to say, supposing that Isopel ever could have been happy\r\nwith a lover\r\n\r\n     So _laggard_ in love, _though_ so dauntless in war\r\n\r\nas George Borrow.\r\n\r\n[429] As well as the Balzacian following, _haud passibus aequis_, above\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\n[430] I do not know whether any other novelists continued the series of\r\ndiversely coloured \"doctors,\" as the fly-makers have done.\r\n\r\n[431] He _could_ \"piffle\" when he went out of it. The would-be satirical\r\ncharacterisation of two aristocrats, Madame d'Arlange and M. de\r\nCommarin, in the book shortly to be noticed, is the thinnest\r\nand most conventional of things, except, perhaps, the companion\r\ntrap-to-catch-the-French-Philistine of anti-clericalism which also shows\r\nitself sometimes.\r\n\r\n[432] Two people, thinking of moving house in London, went once to\r\ninspect an advertised abode in the Kensington district. They did not\r\nmuch like the street; they still less liked a very grim female who\r\nopened the door and showed them over the house; and there was nothing to\r\nreconcile them in the house itself. But, wishing to be polite, the lady\r\nof the couple, as they were leaving, addressed to the grim guardian some\r\nfeeble compliment on something or other as being \"nice.\" \"P'raps,\" was\r\nthe reply, \"for them as likes the ---- Road.\" It is unnecessary to say\r\nthat the visitors went down the steps in a fashion for which we have no\r\nexact English term, but which is admirably expressed by the French verb\r\n_dégringoler_.\r\n\r\n[433] The favouritism declined, and the history of its decline was\r\nanecdotised in a fashion somewhat _gaulois_, but quite harmless. \"Uncle\r\nBeuve,\" to the astonishment of literary mankind, put the portrait of\r\nthis \"nephew\" of his in his _salon_. After _Daniel_ (I think) it was\r\nmoved to the dining-room, and thence to his bedroom. Later it was missed\r\neven there, and was, or was said to be, relegated to _un lieu plus\r\nintime encore_. The _trovatore_ of this probably remembered his\r\nRabelais.\r\n\r\n[434] The labour of reading the book has been repaid by a few useful\r\nspecimens of Feydeau's want of anything like distinction of thought or\r\nstyle. He makes his hero (whom he does not in the least mean for a fool,\r\nthough he is one) express surprise at the fact that when he was _in\r\nstatu pupillari_ he liked _fredaines_, but when he became his own master\r\ndid not care about them! Again: \"Were I to possess the power and\r\ninfinite charm of HIM [_sic_] who invented the stars I could never\r\nexactly paint the delightful creature who stood before me.\" Comment on\r\neither of these should be quite needless. Again: \"Her nose, by a happy\r\nand bold curve, joined itself to the lobes, lightly expanded, of her\r\ndiaphanous nostrils.\" Did it never occur to the man that a nose,\r\nseparately considered from its curve and its nostrils, is terribly like\r\nthat of La Camarde herself? I wasted some time over the tedious trilogy\r\nof _Un Début à L'Opera_, _M. de Saint Bertrand_, _Le Mari de la\r\nDanseuse_. Nobody--not even anybody _qui_ Laclos _non odit_--need follow\r\nme.\r\n\r\n[435] Their author wrote others--_Babolin_, _Autour d'une Source_ etc.\r\nBut the wise who can understand words will perhaps confine themselves to\r\n_Mr., Mme. et Bébé_ and its sequel.\r\n\r\n[436] Cf. _inf._ on M. Rod.\r\n\r\n[437] There is a paper on Cherbuliez in _Essays on French Novelists_,\r\nwhere fuller account of individual works, and very full notice, with\r\ntranslations, of _Le Roman d'une Honnéte Femme_ and _Meta Holdenis_ will\r\nbe found.\r\n\r\n[438] _History of Criticism_, vol. iii. See also below.\r\n\r\n[439] The author of the _Fleurs du Mal_ himself might have been\r\ndistinguished in prose fiction. The _Petits Poëmes en Prose_ indeed\r\nabstain from story-interest even more strictly than their avowed\r\npattern, _Gaspard de la Nuit_. But _La Fanfarlo_ is capitally told.\r\n\r\n[440] Hugo might do this; hardly a Hugonicule.\r\n\r\n[441] There used to be a fancy for writing books about groups of\r\ncharacters. Somebody might do worse in book-making than \"Great Editors,\"\r\nand Veuillot should certainly be one of them.\r\n\r\n[442] The inadvertences which characterise him could hardly be better\r\ninstanced than in his calling the eminent O'Donovan Rossa \"_le\r\ndéputé-martyr_ de Tipperary.\" In English, if not in French, a\r\n\"deputy-martyr\" is a delightful person.\r\n\r\n[443] Its articles are made up--rather dangerously, but very\r\nskilfully--of shorter reviews of individual books published sometimes at\r\nlong intervals.\r\n\r\n[444] Who replied explosively.\r\n\r\n[445] There used to be something of a controversy whether it should be\r\nthus or Aur_é_villy. But the modern editions, at least, never have the\r\naccent.\r\n\r\n[446] Very little above it I should put the not wholly dissimilar liquor\r\nobtained, at great expense and trouble, by a late nobleman of high\r\ncharacter and great ability from (it was said) an old monkish vineyard\r\nin the Isle of Britain. The monks must have exhausted the goodness of\r\nthat _clos_; or else have taken the wine as a penance.\r\n\r\n[447] Huysmans on this is very funny.\r\n\r\n[448] A Spanish duchess of doubly and trebly \"azured\" blood revenges\r\nherself on her husband, who has massacred her lover before her eyes and\r\ngiven his heart to dogs, by becoming a public prostitute in Paris, and\r\ndying in the Salpêtrière. It is almost, if not quite, a masterpiece.\r\n\r\n[449] Barbey's dislike of Feuillet was, evidently and half-confessedly,\r\nincreased by his notion that _M. de Camors_ had \"lifted\" something from\r\n_L'Ensorcelée_. There is also perhaps a touch of _Le Bonheur dans le\r\nCrime_ in _La Morte_.\r\n\r\n[450] He knew a good deal (quite independently of Byron and Brummel)\r\nabout English literature. One is surprised to find somewhere a reference\r\nto Walpole's story of Fielding and his dinner-companions.\r\n\r\n[451] Observe that this is no demand for the explanation of the\r\nsupernatural. Let the supernatural remain as it is, by all means. But\r\ncurses should have causes. Até and Weird are terrible goddesses, but\r\nthey are not unreasonable ones. They might be less _terrible_ if they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\n[452] He has for two years been ordered to be present, but forbidden to\r\ncelebrate; in punishment for his having, uncanonically, fought as a\r\nChouan--if not also for attempted suicide. But we hear of no\r\namorousness, and the husband Le Hardouey's jealousy, though prompted by\r\nhis wife's apparent self-destruction, is definitely stated to have no\r\nfoundation in actual guilt with the priest. On the contrary, she\r\ndeclares that he cared nothing for her.\r\n\r\n[453] Of Geoffroy Tory's book which (_v. sup._ Vol. I. p. 124) helped to\r\ngive us the Limousin student.\r\n\r\n[454] It is possible that some readers may say, \"Where are\r\nErckmann-Chatrian?\" The fact is that I have never been able to find, in\r\nthose twin-brethren, either literature or that not quite literary\r\ninterest which some others have found. But I do not wish to abuse them,\r\nand they have given much pleasure to these others. So I let them alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nNATURALISM--THE GONCOURTS, ZOLA, AND MAUPASSANT\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The beginnings.]\r\n\r\nIf I were writing this _History_ on the lines which some of my critics\r\n(of whom, let it be observed, I do not make the least complaint) seem to\r\nprefer, or at least to miss their absence, a very large part of this\r\nchapter would give me the least possible difficulty. I should simply\r\ntake M. Zola's _Le Roman Expérimental_ and M. Brunetière's _Le Roman\r\nNaturaliste_ and \"combine my information.\" The process--easy to any one\r\nof some practice in letters--could be easier to no one than to me. For I\r\nread and reviewed both books very carefully at their first appearance; I\r\nhad them on my shelves for many years; and the turning of either over\r\nfor a quarter of an hour, or half at the most, would put its contents\r\nonce more at my fingers' ends. But, as I have more than once pointed\r\nout, elaborate boiling down of them would not accord with my scheme and\r\nplan. Inasmuch as the episode or passage[455] is perhaps, of all those\r\nwhich make up our story, the most remarkable instance of a deliberate\r\n\"school\"--of a body of work planned and executed under more or less\r\ndefinite schedules--something if not much more of the critical kind\r\nthan usual may be given, either here or in the Conclusion.[456] But we\r\nshall, I think, learn far better things as to M. Zola and those about\r\nhim by considering what they--at least what he, his would-be teachers,\r\nand his greatest disciple--actually did, than by inquiring what they\r\nmeant, or thought they meant, to do, or what other people thought about\r\nthem and their doings.\r\n\r\nLet us therefore, in the first place and as usual, stick to the history,\r\nthough even this may require more than one mode and division of dealing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Les deux Goncourt.\"]\r\n\r\nThe body of Naturalist or Experimental novels which, beginning in the\r\n'sixties of the century, extended to, and a little over, its close, has\r\nlong been, and will probably always continue to be, associated with the\r\nname of Émile Zola. But the honour or dishonour of the invention and\r\npioneering of the thing was claimed by another, for himself and a third\r\nwriter, that is to say, by Edmond de Goncourt for himself and his\r\nbrother Jules. The elder of the Goncourts--the younger died in early\r\nmiddle age, and knowledge of him is in a way indirect, though we have\r\nsome letters--might be said to have, like Restif, a _manie de\r\npaternité_, though his children were of a different class. He thought he\r\ninvented Naturalism; he thought he introduced into France what some\r\nunkind contemporaries called \"Japon_i_aiserie\";[457] he certainly had a\r\ngood deal to do with reviving the fancy for eighteenth-century art,\r\nartists, _bric-à-brac_ generally, and in a way letters; and he ended by\r\nfathering and endowing an opposition Academy. It was with art that \"Les\r\ndeux Goncourt\"[458] (who were inseparable in their lives, and whom\r\nEdmond--to do him the justice which in his case can rarely be done\r\npleasantly--did his best to keep undivided after Jules's death) began\r\ntheir dealings with eighteenth-century and other artists[459]--perhaps\r\nthe most valuable of all their work. But it was not till the Second\r\nEmpire was nearly half-way through, till Jules was thirty and Edmond\r\nthirty-eight, that they tried fiction (drama also, but always\r\nunsuccessfully), and brought out, always together and before 1870 (when\r\nJules died), a series of some half-dozen novels: _Charles Demailly_\r\n(afterwards re-titled) (1860), _Soeur Philomène_ (next year), _Renée\r\nMauperin_ (1864), _Germinie Lacerteux_ (next year), _Manette Salomon_\r\n(1867), and _Madame Gervaisais_ (1869).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their work.]\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to add that, besides the work already mentioned and\r\npublished before 1870, the two had given a book called _Idées et\r\nSensations_, setting forth their literary psychology; and that, after\r\nthe cataclysm, Edmond published a description of their house and its\r\ncollections, his brother's letters, and an immense _Journal des\r\nGoncourt_ in some half-score of volumes, which was, naturally enough,\r\none of the most read books of its time. Naturally, for it appealed to\r\nall sorts of tastes, reputable and disreputable, literary-artistic and\r\nPhilistine, with pairs enough of antithetic or complementary epithets\r\nenough to fill this page. Here you could read about Sainte-Beuve and\r\nGautier, about Taine and Renan, about Tourguénieff and Flaubert, as well\r\nas about Daudet and Zola, and a score of other more or less interesting\r\npeople. Here you could read how Edmond as a boy made irruptions into a\r\nnewly-married cousin's bedroom, and about the interesting sight he saw\r\nthere; how an English virtuoso had his books bound in human skin; how\r\npeople dined during the siege of Paris, and a million other things; the\r\nwhole being saturated, larded, or whatever word of the kind be\r\npreferred, with observations on the taste, intellect, and general\r\ngreatness of the MM. de Goncourt, and on the lamentable inferiority of\r\nother people, etc., etc. If it could be purged of its bad blood, the\r\nbook would really deserve to rank, for substance, with Pepys' diary or\r\nwith Walpole's letters.[460] As it is, when it has become a little\r\nforgotten, the quarterly reviewers, or their representatives, of the\r\ntwenty-first century will be able to make endless _réchauffés_ of it.\r\nAnd though not titularly or directly of our subject, it belongs thereto,\r\nbecause it shows the process of accumulation or incubation, and the\r\ntemper of the accumulators and incubators in regard to the subjects of\r\nthe novels themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The novels.]\r\n\r\nTo analyse all these novels, or even one of them, at length, would be a\r\nprocess as unnecessary as it would be disagreeable. The \"chronicles of\r\nwasted _grime_\" may be left to themselves, not out of any mere finical\r\nor fastidious superiority, but simply because their own postulates and\r\naxioms make such analysis (if the word unfairness can be used in such a\r\nconnection) unfair to them. For they claimed--and the justice, if not\r\nthe value, of the claim must be allowed--to have rested their fashion of\r\nnovel-writing upon two bases. The substance was to be provided by an\r\nelaborate observation and reproduction of the facts of actual life, not\r\nin the least transcendentalised, inspirited, or in any other way brought\r\nnear Romance, but considered largely from the points of view which their\r\nfriend Taine, writing earlier, used for his philosophical and historical\r\nwork--that of the _milieu_ or \"environment,\" that of heredity, though\r\nthey did not lay so much stress on this as Zola did--and the like. The\r\ntreatment, on the other hand, was to be effected by the use of an\r\nintensely \"personal\" style, a new Marivaudage, compared to which, as we\r\nremarked above, Flaubert's doctrine of the single word was merely\r\nrudimentary. After Jules's death Edmond wrote, alone, _La Fille Elisa_,\r\nwhich was very popular, _La Faustin_, and _Chérie_, the last of which,\r\nwith _Germinie Lacerteux_, may form the basis of a short critical\r\nexamination. Those who merely wish to see if they can like or tolerate\r\nthe Goncourtian novel had perhaps better begin with _Renée Mauperin_ or\r\n_Madame Gervaisais_. Both have been very highly praised,[461] and the\r\nfirst named of them has the proud distinction of putting \"le mot de\r\nCambronne\" in the mouth of a colonel who has been mortally wounded in a\r\nduel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Germinie Lacerteux_ and _Chérie_ taken as specimens.]\r\n\r\nTo return to our selected examples, _Germinie Lacerteux_ is the story of\r\nan actual _bonne_ of the brothers, whose story, without \"trimmings,\" is\r\ntold in the _Journal_ itself.[462] The poor creature is as different as\r\npossible, not merely from the usual heroine, but from the _grisette_ of\r\nthe first half of the century and from the _demi-mondaine_ of Dumas\r\n_fils_, and Daudet, and even Zola. She is not pretty; she is not\r\nfascinating in any way; she is neither good- nor ill-natured in any\r\nspecial fashion; she is not even ambitious of \"bettering\" herself or of\r\nhaving much pleasure, wealth, etc. If she goes to the bad it is in the\r\nmost commonplace way and with the most unseductive seducer possible. Her\r\nprogress and her end are, to borrow a later phrase and title\r\nmetaphorically, merely a tale of the meanest streets; untouched and\r\nunconfirmed by the very slightest art; as destitute of any aesthetic\r\nattraction, or any evidence of artistic power, as the log-books of a\r\ncommon lodging-house and a hospital ward could be. In _Chérie_ there is\r\nnothing exactly improper; it is merely an elaborate study of a\r\nspoilt--at least petted--and unhealthy girl in the upper stages of\r\nsociety, who has at last the kindness--to herself, her relations, and\r\nthe reader--to die. If M. de Goncourt had had the slightest particle of\r\nhumour, of which there is no trace in any of his works, one might have\r\ntaken this, like other things perhaps, as a slightly cryptic parody--of\r\nthe _poitrinaire_-heroine mania of times a little earlier; but there is\r\nno hope of this. The subject was, in the sense attached to the word by\r\nthese writers, \"real\"; it could be made useful for combined\r\nphysiological and psychological detail; and, most important of all, it\r\nwas more or less repulsive.[463]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The impression produced by them.]\r\n\r\nFor this is what it really comes to in the Goncourts, in Zola, and in\r\nthe rest, till Guy de Maupassant, not seldom dealing with the same\r\nmaterial, sublimes it, and so robs it of its repulsiveness, by the force\r\nof true comic, tragic, or romantic art. Or course it is open to any one\r\nto say, \"It may repel _you_, but it does not repel _me_.\" But this is\r\nvery cheap sophistry. We do not require to be told, in the words which\r\nshocked Lord Chesterfield but do not annoy a humble admirer of his, that\r\n\"One man's meat is another man's poison.\" Carrion is not repulsive to a\r\nvulture. Immediately before writing these words I was reading the\r\nconfession of an unfortunate American that he or she found _The\r\nRoundabout Papers_ \"depressing.\" For my part, I have never given up the\r\ndoctrine that _any_ subject _may_ be deprived of its repulsiveness by\r\nthe treatment of it. But when you find a writer, or a set of writers,\r\ndeliberately and habitually selecting subjects which are generally held\r\nto be repellent, and deliberately and habitually refusing or failing to\r\npass them through the alembic in the manner suggested--then I think you\r\nare justified, not merely in condemning their taste, but in thinking not\r\nat all highly of their art. A cook who cannot make his meat savoury\r\nunless it is \"high\" is not a good cook, and if he cannot do without\r\npepper and garlic[464] he is not much better.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rottenness of their theory.]\r\n\r\nDismissing, however, for a moment the question of mere taste, it should\r\nbe evident that the doctrine of rigid \"observation,\" \"document,\"\r\n\"experience,\" and the like is bad in art. Like so many--some optimists\r\nwould say like all--bad things, it is, of course, a corruption, by\r\nexcess and defect both, of something good or at least true. It cannot be\r\nnecessary here, after scores of expressions of opinion on the subject\r\nthroughout this book, to admit or urge the importance of observation of\r\nactual life to the novelist. The most ethereal of fairy-tales and the\r\nwildest of extravaganzas would be flimsy rubbish if not corroborated by\r\nand contrasted with it: it can be strengthened, increased, varied almost\r\nat discretion in the novel proper. I hold it, as may be argued perhaps\r\nin the Conclusion, to be the principle and the justification of Romance\r\nitself. But, independently of the law just mentioned, that you must not\r\nconfine your observation to Ugliness and exclude Beauty--it will not do\r\nto pull out the pin of your cart, and tilt a collection of observed\r\nfacts on the hapless pavement of the reader's mind. You are not a\r\nreporter; not a compiler of _dossiers_; not a photographer. You are an\r\nartist, and you must do something with your materials, add something of\r\nyourself to them, present something not vamped from parts of actual life\r\nitself, but reinforcing those parts with aesthetic re-creation and with\r\nthe sense of \"the whole.\" I find this--to confine ourselves strictly to\r\nthe famous society so often mentioned in the _Journal_--eminently in\r\nFlaubert, and as far as one can judge from translations, in\r\nTourguénieff; I find it, to a less extent, in Daudet; I find it\r\nsometimes even in Zola, especially, but not merely, in his shorter\r\nstories; I find it again, and abundantly, in Maupassant. But I never\r\nfind it in the Goncourts: and when I find it in the others it is because\r\nthey have either never bowed the knee to, or have for the nonce\r\ndiscarded, the cult of the Naturalist, experimental, documentary idol,\r\nin itself and for itself.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" some one may say, \"you have neglected one very important point to\r\nwhich you have yourself referred, and as to which you have just\r\nrecommitted yourself. Did not _les deux_ 'add something,' a very\r\nconsiderable something, 'of their own'? How about their style?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And the unattractiveness of their style.]\r\n\r\nCertainly they prided themselves on this, and certainly they took a\r\ngreat deal of trouble about it. If any one likes the result, let him\r\nlike it. It appears to me only to prove that an unsound principle is not\r\na certain means to secure sound practice. Possibly, as Edmond boasted,\r\nthis style is not the style _de tout le monde_. And _tout le monde_ may\r\ncongratulate itself on the fact. One can see that it _must_ have given\r\nthem a good deal of trouble--perhaps as much as, say, Paul de\r\nSaint-Victor's gave him. But then his excites a cheerful glow of\r\nsatisfaction, whereas theirs only creates, as Saint-Victor himself (to\r\none's regret) says of Swift, _un morne étonnement_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Émile Zola to be treated differently.]\r\n\r\nThe tone which has been adopted[465] in speaking of the Goncourts (or\r\nrather of Edmond de Goncourt, for Jules seems to have been the better\r\nfellow pretty certainly, as well as probably the more genuine talent, of\r\nthe two) would be grossly unfair in dealing with Émile Zola. One may\r\nthink his principle demonstrably wrong, and his practice for the most\r\npart a calamitous mistake. One may, while, if indeed it concerned us,\r\nclearing him of the charge of doing any moral harm--such harm would be\r\nas likely to be done by records of Bedlam, or the Lock Hospital, or a\r\ndipsomaniacs' home--put on the wrong side of his account a quantity of\r\ndull and dirty trash,[466] which, without his precept and example, would\r\nnever have been written, or, if written, read. But the great, if mostly\r\nwasted, power displayed in his work is quite undeniable by any real\r\ncritic; he did some things--and more parts of things--absolutely good;\r\nand if, as has been admitted, he did literary evil, he upset in a\r\ncurious fashion the usual dictum that the evil that men do lives after\r\nthem. At least it was not his fault if such was the case. He\r\nundoubtedly, whether he actually invented it or not, established,\r\ncommunicated, spread the error of Naturalism. But he lived long enough\r\nand wrote hard enough to \"work it out\" in a singular fashion--to\r\nillustrate the rottenness of the tree by the canker of the fruit to such\r\nan extent, and in such variety of application and example, that nobody\r\nfor a long time has had any excuse for grafting the one or eating the\r\nother. Personally--in those points of personality which touch literature\r\nreally, and out of the range of mere gossip--he had many good qualities.\r\nHe was transparently honest, his honesty being tested and attested by a\r\ndefect which will be noticed presently. He appears to have had no bad\r\nblood in him. His fidelity and devotion to what he thought art were as\r\nunflinching as Flaubert's own.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some points in his personality--literary and other.]\r\n\r\nNor was he deficient in good qualities which were still more purely\r\nliterary. We shall speak later of the excellence of his short stories;\r\nif he had never written anything else there would be hardly anything but\r\npraise for him. When he does not lose himself in the wilderness of\r\nparticulars, he sometimes manages to rise from it to wonderful\r\nPisgah-sights of description. He has a really vast, though never an\r\nabsolute or consummate, and always a morbid, hold on what may be called\r\nthe second range of character, and a drastic, if rather mechanical,\r\nfaculty of combining scenes and incidents. The mass of the\r\nRougon-Macquart books is very much more coherent than the _Comédie\r\nHumaine_. He has real pathos. But perhaps his greatest quality, shown at\r\nintervals throughout but never fully developed till the chaotic and\r\nsometimes almost Blake-like Apocalypses of his last stage, was a\r\ngrandiosity of fancy--nearly reaching imagination, and not incapable of\r\ndressing itself in suitable language--which, though one traces some\r\nindebtedness to Lamennais and Michelet and Hugo, has sufficient\r\nindividuality, and, except in these four, is very rarely found in French\r\nliterature later than the sixteenth or early seventeenth century. To set\r\nagainst these merits--still leaving the main fault alone--there are some\r\nstrange defects. Probably worst of all, for it has its usual appalling\r\npervasiveness, is his almost absolute want of humour. Humour and\r\nNaturalism, indeed, could not possibly keep house together; as we shall\r\nsee in Maupassant, the attempt has happier results than in the case of\r\n\"Long John Brown and Little Mary Bell,\" for the fairy expels the Devil\r\nat times wholly. The minor and particular absurdities which result from\r\nthis want of humour crop up constantly in the books; and it is said to\r\nhave been taken advantage of by Maupassant himself in one instance, the\r\ndisciple \"bamming\" the master into recording the existences of\r\npeculiarly specialised places of entertainment, which the fertile fancy\r\nof the author of _Boule de Suif_ had created.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pillars of Naturalism.]\r\n\r\nThe Naturalist Novel, as practised by Zola, rests on three principal\r\nsupports, or rather draws its materials from, and guides its\r\ntreatment by, three several processes or doctrines. The general\r\nobservational-experimental theory of the Goncourts is very widely, in\r\nfact almost infinitely extended, \"documents\" being found or made in or\r\nout of the literal farrago of all occupations and states of life. But,\r\nas concerns the definitely \"human\" part of the matter, immense stress is\r\nlaid on the Darwinian or Spencerian doctrines of heredity, environment,\r\nevolution, and the like. While, last of all in order, if the influence\r\nbe taken as converging towards the reason of the failure, comes the\r\n\"medico-legal\" notion of a \"lesion\"--of some flaw or vicious and\r\ncancerous element--a sort of modernised [Greek: prôtarchos atê] in the\r\nfamily, which develops itself variously in individuals.\r\n\r\nNow, before pointing out the faulty results of this as shown generally\r\nin the various books, let us, reversing the order in which the\r\ninfluences or elements have been stated, set out the main lines of error\r\nin the elements themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it must surely be obvious that insistence on the\r\n\"lesion,\" even if the other points of the theory were unassailable, is\r\ngrossly excessive, if not wholly illegitimate. If you are to take\r\nobservation and experience for your sole magazine of subjects, you must\r\ntake _all_ experience and _all_ observation. Not the veriest pessimist\r\nwho retains sense and senses can say that their results are _always_\r\nevil, ugly, and sordid. If you are to go by heredity you must attend to:\r\n\r\n    Fortes creantur fortibus et bonis,\r\n\r\nas well as to:\r\n\r\n    Aetas parentum pejor avis tulit, etc.\r\n\r\nRemounting the stairs, it must be evident that Heredity, Natural\r\nSelection, Evolution, Environment, etc., are things which, at the very\r\nbest, can be allowed an exceedingly small part in artistic re-creation.\r\nNot only do they come under the general ban of Purpose, but their\r\npurpose-character is of the most thankless and unsucculent kind. I do\r\nnot know that any one has ever attempted a mathematical novel, though\r\nthe great Mr. Higgins of St. Mary Axe, as we all know, wrote a beautiful\r\nmathematical poem, of which the extant fragments are, alas! too few. If\r\nhe had only lived a generation later, how charming would have been the\r\nfytte or canto on Quaternions! But, really, such a thing would not be\r\nmore than a \"farthest\" on a road on which heredity-and-selection novels\r\ntravel far. It is no use to say, \"Oh! but human beings exemplifying\r\nthose things can be made interesting.\" If they are it will not be\r\nbecause they are dealt with _sub specie hereditatis_, and confined in\r\nthe circle of _milieu_.\r\n\r\nYet the master error lies, farther back still, in the strictly\r\n\"Naturalist\" idea itself--the theory of Experiment, the\r\nobservation-document-\"note,\" all for their own sake. Something has been\r\nsaid of this in relation to the Goncourts, but M. Zola's own\r\nexemplification of the doctrine was so far \"larger\" in every sense than\r\ntheirs, and reinforced with so much greater literary power, that it\r\ncannot be left merely to the treatment which was sufficient for them.\r\nOnce more, it is a case of \"corruption of the best.\" It is perfectly\r\ntrue that all novel-writing--even in a fashion all romance-writing\r\ntoo--ought to be based on experience[467] in practical life, and that\r\ninfinite documents are procurable, infinite notes may be made, from that\r\nlife. It is utterly _un_true that _any_ observation, _any_ experiment,\r\n_any_ document is good novel or romance stuff.\r\n\r\nA very few remarks may perhaps be made on approaches to Zolaism--not in\r\nthe sense of scabrousness--before Zola.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Document\" and \"detail\" before Naturalism.]\r\n\r\nA writer of one of those theses _à la mode Germanorum_, of which, at\r\ndifferent times and in different occupations, it is the hard lot of the\r\nprofessional man of letters to read so many, would probably begin with\r\nthe Catalogue of Ships, or construct an inventory of the \"beds and\r\nbasons\" which Barzillai brought to David. Quite a typical \"program\"\r\nmight be made of the lists of birds, beasts, trees, etc., so well known\r\nin mediaeval literature, and best known to the ordinary English reader\r\nfrom Chaucer, and from Spenser's following of him. We may, however, pass\r\nto the Deluge of the Renaissance and the special emergence therefrom of\r\nFrench fiction. It would not be an absolute proof of the \"monographitis\"\r\njust glanced at if any one were to instance the curious discussions on\r\nthe propriety of introducing technical terms into heroic poetry--which\r\nis, of course, very close to heroic romance, and so to prose fiction\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General stages traced.]\r\n\r\nBut, for practical purposes, Furetière and the _Roman Bourgeois_ (_vide_\r\nVol. I.) give the starting-point. And here the Second Part, of which we\r\nformerly said little, acquires special importance, though the first is\r\nnot without it. _All_ the details of _bourgeois_ life and middle-class\r\nsociety belong to the department which was afterwards preferred--and\r\ndegraded--by the Naturalists; and the legal ins and outs of the Second\r\nPart are Zola in a good deal more than the making. Indeed the luckless\r\n\"Charroselles\" himself had, as we pointed out, anticipated Furetière in\r\nnot a few points, such as that most interesting reference to\r\n_bisque_.[468] Scarron himself has a good deal of it; in fact there is\r\nso much in the Spanish picaresque novel that it could not be absent from\r\nthe followings thereof. For which same reason there is not a very little\r\nof it in Lesage, while, for an opposite one, there is less in Marivaux,\r\nand hardly any at all in Crébillon or Prévost. The _philosophes_, except\r\nDiderot--who was busy with other things and used his acquaintance with\r\nmiscellaneous \"documents\" in another way--would have disdained it, and\r\nthe Sentimentalists still more so. But it is a sign of the shortcomings\r\nof Pigault-Lebrun--especially considering the evident discipleship to\r\nSmollett, in whom there is no small amount of such detail--that, while\r\nin general he made a distinct advance in \"ordinary\" treatment, he did\r\nnot reinforce this advance with circumstantial accounts of \"beds and\r\nbasons.\"\r\n\r\nBut with the immense and multifarious new birth of the novel at the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, this development also received, in\r\nthe most curiously diverse ways, reinforcement and extension. The Terror\r\nnovel itself had earlier given a hand, for you had to describe, more or\r\nless minutely, the furniture of your haunted rooms, the number and\r\nvolume of your drops of blood, the anatomical characteristics of your\r\nskeletons, and the values of your palette of coloured fires. The\r\nHistorical novel lugged document in too often by head and shoulders,\r\nintroducing it on happier occasions as the main and distinguishing\r\nornament of its kind. Romanticism generally, with its tendency to\r\nantiquarian detail, its liking for _couleur locale_, its insistence on\r\nthe \"streaks of the tulip\" and the rest, prompted the use and at least\r\nsuggested the abuse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some individual pioneers--especially Hugo.]\r\n\r\nNor did the great individual French novelists--for we need not specify\r\nany others--of the earlier part of the century, while they themselves\r\nkept to the pleasant slopes above the abyss, fail to point the way to\r\nit. Chateaubriand with his flowery descriptions of East and West, and\r\nMadame de Staël with her deliberate guide-bookery, encouraged the\r\ndocument-hunter and detail-devotee. Balzac, especially in the directions\r\nof finance and commerce, actually set him an example. George Sand,\r\nespecially in pure country stories, was prodigal of local and technical\r\nmatters and manners. The gorgeous scenery of Gautier, and the soberer\r\nbut important \"settings\" of Mérimée, might be claimed as models. And\r\nothers might be added.\r\n\r\nBut from one point of view, as an authority above all earlier\r\nauthorities, and from another as a sinner beyond all earlier sinners,\r\nmight be quoted Victor Hugo, even putting his _juvenilia_ aside. He had\r\nflung a whole glossary of architecture, not to mention other things of\r\nsimilar kind, into _Notre Dame de Paris_; and when after a long interval\r\nhe resumed prose fiction, he had ransacked the encyclopaedia for _Les\r\nMisérables_. _Les Travailleurs de la Mer_ is half a great poem and half\r\na _real-lexikon_ of mechanics, weather-lore, seafaring, ichthyology, and\r\nGod knows what else! If _L'Homme Qui Rit_ had been written a very little\r\nlater, parts of it might have been taken as a deliberate burlesque, by a\r\nFrench Sir Francis Burnand, of Naturalist method. Now, as the most acute\r\nliterary historians have always seen, Naturalism was practically\r\nnothing but a degeneration of Romanticism:[469] and degeneracy always\r\nshows itself in exaggeration. Naturalism exaggerated detail, streak of\r\ntulip, local colour, and all the rest, of which Romanticism had made\r\nsuch good use at its best. But what it exaggerated most of all was the\r\nRomantic neglect of classical _decorum_, in the wider as well as the\r\nnarrower sense of that word. Classicism had said, \"Keep everything\r\nindecorous out.\" Naturalism seemed sometimes to say, \"Let nothing that\r\nis not indecorous come in.\"[470]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Survey of books--the short stories.]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, by no means at first that M. Zola took to the\r\n\"document\" or elaborated the enormous scheme of the Rougon-Macquart\r\ncycle: though whether the excogitation of this was or was not due to the\r\nfrequentation, exhortation, and imitation of MM. de Goncourt is not a\r\npoint that we need discuss. He began, after melodramatic and negligible\r\n_juvenilia_, in 1864 with a volume of delightful short stories,[471]\r\n_Contes à Ninon_, in which kind he long afterwards showed undiminished\r\npowers. And he continued this practice at intervals for a great number\r\nof years, with results collected, after the first set, in _Nouveaux\r\nContes à Ninon_, and in volumes taking their general titles from special\r\ntales--_Le Capitaine Burle_ and _Naïs Micoulin_. In 1880 he gave the\r\nfirst story, _L'Attaque du Moulin_, to that most remarkable Naturalist\r\n\"symposium,\" _Les Soirées de Médan_, which, if nothing of it survived\r\nbut that story itself and Maupassant's _Boule de Suif_, and if this\r\nrepresented the sole extant work of the School, would certainly induce\r\nthe fortieth century to think that School one of the very best in\r\nfiction, and to utter the most pathetic wails over the loss of the rest\r\nof its production. Of _Boule de Suif_--in more senses than one the\r\nfeminine of the pair--more presently. But _L'Attaque_ itself is a\r\nsplendid and masculine success--the best thing by far, in respect of\r\nflawlessness, that its author ever did, and not far below Mérimée's\r\n_Prise de la Redoute_.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it was not in these breaches that M. Zola chose to abide.\r\nAfter the war, having no doubt laid his plans long before, he undertook\r\nthe vast Rougon-Macquart scheme with its score of volumes; and when this\r\nwas finished, carried on two others, smaller in bulk but hardly less\r\nambitious in scope, \"Les Trois Villes\"--_Lourdes_, _Paris_, _Rome_; and\r\n\"Les Quatre Évangiles\"--_Fécondité_, _Travail_, and _Vérité_, the fourth\r\nof which was never written, while the third, _Vérité_, appeared with a\r\nblack line round its cover, denoting posthumous issue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Les Rougon-Macquart.\"]\r\n\r\nIn all these books the Experimental and Documentary idea is worked out,\r\nwith an important development in the other directions above glanced at.\r\nThe whole of the Rougon-Macquart series was intended to picture the\r\nvarying careers of the branches, legitimate and illegitimate, of two\r\nfamilies, under the control of heredity, and the evolution of the\r\ncerebral lesion into various kinds of disease, fault, vice, crime, etc.\r\nBut further scope was found for the use of the document, human and\r\nother, by allotment of the various books, both in this and in the later\r\ngroups, to the special illustration of particular places, trades,\r\nprofessions, habits of life, and _quicquid agunt homines_ generally. The\r\n_super_-title of the first and largest series, \"Les Rougon-Macquart:\r\nHistoire naturelle et sociale d'une famille sous le Second Empire,\" can\r\nhardly need comment or amplification to any intellect that is not\r\nhopelessly enslaved to the custom of having its meat not only killed,\r\ndressed, cooked, and dished, but cut up, salted, peppered, and put into\r\nits mouth with assiduous spoonings. _La Fortune des Rougon_, in the\r\nvery year when Europe invited a _polemos aspondos_ by acquiescing in the\r\nseizure of Alsace-Lorraine, laid the foundation of the whole. _La Curée_\r\nand _Son Excellence Eugène Rougon_ show how the more fortunate members\r\nof the clan prospered in the somewhat ignoble _tripotage_ of their time.\r\nAnybody could see the \"power\" of which the thing was \"effect\" (to borrow\r\none half of a celebrated aphorism of Hobbes's); but it must have been a\r\ncurious taste to which (borrowing the other) the books were \"a cause of\r\npleasure.\" _La Faute de l'Abbé Mouret_ rose to a much higher level. To\r\nregard it as merely an attack on clerical celibacy is to take a very\r\nobvious and limited view of it. It is so, of course, but it is much\r\nmore. The picture of the struggle between conscience and passion is, for\r\nonce, absolutely true and human. There is no mistake in the psychology;\r\nthere is no resort to \"sculduddery\"; there is no exaggeration of any\r\nkind, or, if there is any, it is in a horticultural extravagance--a\r\npiece of fairy Bower-of-Bliss scene-painting, in part of the book, which\r\nis in itself almost if not quite beautiful--a Garden of Eden provided\r\nfor a different form of temptation.[472] There is no poetry in _La\r\nConquête de Plassans_ or in _Le Ventre de Paris_; but the one is a\r\ndigression, not yet scavenging, into country life, and the other empties\r\none of M. Zola's note-books on a theme devoted to the Paris Markets--the\r\nfamous \"Halles\" which Gérard had done so lightly and differently long\r\nbefore.[473] The key of this latter is pretty well kept in one of the\r\nmost famous books of the whole series, _L'Assommoir_, where the\r\nbeastlier side of pot-house sotting receives hundreds of pages to do\r\nwhat William Langland had done better five centuries earlier in a few\r\nscore lines. _Pot-Bouille_--ascending a little in the social but not in\r\nthe spiritual scale--deals with lower middle-class life, and _Au Bonheur\r\ndes Dames_ with the enormous \"stores\" which, beginning in America, had\r\nalready spread through Paris to London. _Une Page d'Amour_ recovers\r\nsomething of the nobler tone of _L'Abbé Mouret_; and _La Joie de\r\nVivre_--a title, as will readily be guessed, ironical in\r\nintention--still keeps out of the gutter. _Nana_ may be said, combining\r\ndecency with exactitude, to stand in the same relation to the service of\r\nVenus as _L'Assommoir_ does to that of Bacchus, though one apologises to\r\nboth divinities for so using their names. It was supposed, like other\r\nbooks of the kind, to be founded on fact--the history of a certain young\r\nperson known as Blanche d'Antigny--and charitable critics have pleaded\r\nfor it as a healthy corrective or corrosive to the morbid tone of\r\nsentimentality-books like _La Dame aux Camélias_. I never could find\r\nmuch amusement in the book, except when Nana, provoked at the tedious\r\nprolongation of a professional engagement, exclaims, \"Ça ne finissait\r\npas!\" or \"Ça ne voulait pas finir.\"[474] The strange up-and-down of the\r\nwhole scheme reappears in _L'Oeuvre_--chiefly devoted to art, but\r\npartly to literature--where the opening is extraordinarily good, and\r\nthere are fine passages later, interspersed with tedious grime of the\r\ncommoner kind. _La Terre_ and _Germinal_ are, I suppose, generally\r\nregarded as, even beyond _L'Assommoir_ and _Nana_, the \"farthest\" of\r\nthis griminess. Whether the filth-stored broom of the former really does\r\nblot out George Sand's and other pictures of a modified Arcadia in the\r\nFrench provinces, nothing but experience, which I cannot boast, could\r\ntell us; and the same may be said of _Germinal_, as to the mining\r\ndistricts which have since received so awful a purification by fire.\r\nThat more and more important person the railway-man takes his turn in\r\n_La Bête Humaine_, and the book supplies perhaps the most striking\r\ninstance of the radically inartistic character of the plan of flooding\r\nfiction with technical details. But there is, in the vision of the\r\ndriver and his engine as it were going mad together, one of the earliest\r\nand not the least effective of those nightmare-pieces in which Zola,\r\nevidently inspired by Hugo, indulged more and more latterly. Then came\r\nwhat was intended, apparently, for the light star of this dark group,\r\n_Le Rêve_. Although always strongly anti-clerical, and at the last, as\r\nwe shall see, a \"Deicide\" of the most uncompromising fanaticism, M. Zola\r\nhere devoted himself to cathedral services and church ritual generally,\r\nand, as a climax, the administration of extreme unction to his innocent\r\nheroine. But, as too often happens in such cases, the saints were not\r\ngrateful and the sinners were bored. _L'Argent_ was at least in\r\nconcatenation accordingly, seeing that the great financial swindle and\r\n\"crash\"[475] it took for subject had had strong clerical support; but\r\npurely financial matters, stock-exchange dealings, and some exceedingly\r\nscabrous \"trimmings\" occupied the greater part of it. Of the penultimate\r\nnovel, _La Débâcle_, a history of the terrible birth-year of the series\r\nitself, few fair critics, I think, could speak other than highly; of the\r\nactual ultimatum, _Le Docteur Pascal_, opinions have varied much. It is\r\nvery unequal, but I thought when it came out that it contained some of\r\nits author's very best things, and I am not disposed to change my\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Les Trois Villes.\"]\r\n\r\nBefore giving any general comment on this mass of fiction, it will\r\nprobably be best to continue the process of brief survey, with the two\r\nremaining groups. It is, I believe, generally admitted that in \"Les\r\nTrois Villes\" purpose, and the document, got altogether the better of\r\nany true novel-intention. The anti-religiosity which has been already\r\nremarked upon seems not only to have increased, but for the moment to\r\nhave simply flooded our author's ship of thought and art, and to have\r\nstopped the working of that part of its engine-room which did the\r\nnovel-business. The miracles at, and the pilgrimages to, Lourdes filled\r\nthe newspapers at one time, and Zola could think of nothing else; the\r\ntransition to Rome was almost inevitable in any such case; and the\r\nreturn upon Paris quite inevitable in a Frenchman.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Les Quatre Évangiles.\"]\r\n\r\nWith the final and incomplete series--coinciding in its latter part with\r\nthe novelist's passionate interference, at no small inconvenience to\r\nhimself, in that inconceivable modern replica of the Hermocopidae\r\nbusiness, the Dreyfus case, and cut short by his unfortunate\r\ndeath--things are different. I have known people far less \"prejudiced,\"\r\nas the word goes, against the ideas of these books than I am myself, who\r\nplumply declare that they cannot read _Fécondité_, _Travail_, or (most\r\nespecially) _Vérité_: while of course there are others who declare them\r\nto be not \"Gospels\" at all, but what Mr. Carlyle used to call\r\n\"Ba'spels\"--not Evangels but Cacodaemonics. I read every word of them\r\ncarefully some years since, and I should not mind reading _Fécondité_ or\r\n_Travail_ again, though I have no special desire to do so.[476]\r\n\r\nBoth are \"novels of purpose,\" with the purpose developing into mania.\r\n_Fécondité_ is only in part--and in that part mainly as regards\r\nFrance--revolutionary. It is a passionate gospel of \"Cultivate _both_\r\ngardens! Produce every ounce of food that can be raised to eat, and\r\nevery child that can be got to eat it:\" an anti-Malthusian and\r\nCobbettist Apocalypse, smeared with Zolaesque grime and lighted up with\r\nflashes, or rather flares, of more than Zolaesque brilliancy. The scene\r\nwhere the hero (so far as there is one) looks back on Paris at night,\r\nand his tottering virtue sees in it one enormous theatre of Lubricity,\r\nhas something of Flaubert and something of Hugo.\r\n\r\n_Travail_ is revolutionary or nothing, revolutionary \"in the most\r\napproved style,\" as a certain apologist of robbery and murder put it not\r\nlong ago as to Bolshevism, amid the \"laughter and cheers\" of English\r\naspirants thereto. It takes for scene a quite openly borrowed\r\nrepresentation of the famous forges of Creusot, and attacks Capital, the\r\n_bourgeois_, and everything established, quite in the purest Bolshevist\r\nfashion. Both books, and _Vérité_, display throughout a singular\r\ndelusion, aggravating the anti-theism rather than atheism above\r\nmentioned, my own formulation of which, in another book some decade ago,\r\nI may as well, in a note,[477] borrow, instead of merely paraphrasing\r\nit. The milder idiosyncrasy referred to therein will certainly not\r\nadjust itself, whatever it might do to the not ungenial ideals of\r\n_Fécondité_, to those of _Travail_. This ends in a sort of Paradise of\r\nMan, where electricity takes every kind of labour (except that of\r\ncultivating the gardens?) off men's hands, and the Coquecigrues have\r\ncome again, and the pigs run about ready roasted, and a millennium or\r\nmill_iard_ennium of Cocaigne begins. Yet there are fine passages in\r\n_Travail_, and the author reflects, powerfully enough, the grime and\r\nglare and scorch of the furnaces; the thirst and lust and struggles of\r\ntheir slaves; the baser side of the life of their owners and\r\nofficials--and of the wives of these. There is nothing in the book quite\r\nequal to the Vision of the City of Lubricity in _Fécondité_, but there\r\nare one or two things not much below it. And the whole is once more\r\nBlake-like, with a degraded or defiled Blakishness. In fact, _Fécondité_\r\nand _Travail_, illustrated in the spirit of the Prophetic Books, are\r\nquite imaginable possessions; and, though a nervous person might not\r\nlike to go to sleep in the same room with them, not uncovetable\r\nones.[478]\r\n\r\nThe everlasting irony of things has seldom, in literature (though, as we\r\nhave seen, it reigns there if anywhere), secured for itself a more\r\nstriking opportunity of exemplification than this ending, in a\r\npseudo-apocalyptic paroxysm, of the _Roman Expérimental_; perhaps one\r\nmay add that never has Romanticism, or indeed any school of letters,\r\nscored such a triumphant victory over its decriers. It has been\r\ncontended here, and for many years in other places by the present\r\nwriter, that Naturalism was itself only a \"lesion,\" a _sarcoma_, a\r\nmorbidly allotropic form of Romance. At this point the degeneration\r\nturned into a sort of parody of the attitude of Ezekiel or Hosea; the\r\nbusiness-like observer, in counting-house and workshop, in church and\r\nstock-exchange, in tavern and brothel, in field and town generally,\r\nbecame himself a _voyant_, beholding all things in nightmare. Yet, in\r\ndoing so, he effected a strange semi-reconciliation with some who had\r\nbeen, if not exactly his enemies, the exceedingly frank critics and\r\nunsparing denouncers of his system. Not much more than half sane, and\r\nalmost more than half disgusting, as are _Fécondité_ and _Travail_, they\r\nconnect themselves, as wholes, not with _L'Assommoir_ or _Nana_, not\r\nwith _La Terre_ or _Germinal_, but with _La Faute de l'Abbé Mouret_,\r\nwith _Une Page d'Amour_, and _La Joie de Vivre_, with the best things in\r\n_L'Oeuvre_, _La Débâcle_, and _Le Docteur Pascal_. Students of English\r\nliterature will remember how the doctrine of _Furor poeticus_ was once\r\napplied to Ben Jonson by a commentator who, addressing him, pointed out\r\nthat he was very mad in his primer works, not so mad in his dotages.\r\nThere was always a good deal of _furor prosaicus_ smouldering in Zola,\r\nand it broke out with an opposite result on these occasions, the flames,\r\nalas! being rather devastating, but affording spectacles at least\r\ngrandiose. _He_ kept sane and sordid to his loss earlier, and went mad\r\nlater--partially at least to his advantage.\r\n\r\n[Sidebar: General considerations.]\r\n\r\nPassing to those more general considerations which have been\r\npromised--and which seem to be to some readers a Promised Land\r\nindeed, as compared with the wilderness of _compte-rendu_ and\r\nbook-appreciation--let us endeavour briefly to answer the question,\r\n\"What is the general lesson of Zola's work?\" I think we may say,\r\nborrowing that true and final judgment of Wordsworth which doth so\r\nenrage Wordsworthians, that whenever Zola does well he either violates\r\nor neglects his principles, and that the more carefully he carries\r\nthese out the worse, as a rule, his work is. The similarity, of course,\r\nis the more quaint because of the dissimilarity of the personages and\r\ntheir productions; but it has not been insisted on from any mere spirit\r\nof mischief, or desire to make a paradoxical parallel. On the contrary,\r\nthis parallel has been made in order to support, at least _obiter_, a\r\nmore general dictum still, that principles are much more often fatal\r\nthan useful to the artist. The successful miniatures of the short\r\nstories hardly prove more thoroughly than the smoky flaming\r\nBlakish-Turneresque cartoons of the latest \"Gospels,\" though they may do\r\nso more satisfactorily, that Émile Zola had the root of the Art of\r\nFiction in him. But he chose to subject the bulk of the growths from\r\nthis root to something much worse than the _ars topiaria_, to twist and\r\nmaim and distort them like Hugo's Comprachicos; to load their boughs,\r\nforbidding them to bear natural fruit, with clumsy crops of dull and\r\nfoul detail, like a bedevilled Christmas-tree. One dares say quite\r\nunblushingly, that in no single instance[479] has this abuse of the\r\nencyclopaedia added charm, or value, or even force to Zola's work. A man\r\nwith far less ability than he possessed could have given the necessary\r\ntouch of specialism when it _was_ necessary, without dumping and\r\ndeluging loads and floods of technicalities on the unhappy reader.\r\n\r\nLittle more need be said about the disastrous _ugliness_ which, with\r\nstill rarer exception, pervades the whole work. There are those who like\r\nthe ugly, and those--perhaps more numerous--who think they _ought_ to\r\nlike it. With neither is it worth while to argue. As for me and my\r\nhouse, we will serve Beauty, giving that blessed word the widest\r\npossible extension, of course, but never going beyond or against it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Especially in regard to character.]\r\n\r\nA point where there is no such precedent inaccessibility of common\r\nground concerns Zola's grasp of character. It seems to me to have been,\r\nif not exactly weak, curiously limited. I do not know that his people\r\nare ever unhuman; in fact, by his time the merely wooden character had\r\nceased to be \"stocked\" (as an unpleasant modern phrase has it) by the\r\nnovelist. The \"divers and disgusting things\" that they do are never\r\nincredible. The unspeakable villain-hero of _Vérité_ itself is a not\r\nimpossible person. But the defect, again as it seems to me, of all the\r\npersonages may best be illustrated by quoting one of those strange\r\nflashes of consummate critical acuteness which diversify the frequent\r\ncritical lapses of Thackeray. As early as _The Paris Sketch-book_, in\r\nthe article entitled \"Caricatures and Lithography,\" Mr. Titmarsh wrote,\r\nin respect of Fielding's people, \"Is not every one of them a real\r\nsubstantial _have been_ personage now?... We will not take upon\r\nourselves to say that they do not exist somewhere else, that the actions\r\nattributed to them have not really taken place.\"\r\n\r\nThere, put by a rather raw critic of some seven and twenty, who was not\r\nhimself to give a perfect creative exemplification of what he wrote for\r\nnearly a decade, is the crux of the matter. Observe, not \"_might_ have\r\nbeen\" merely, but \"have been now.\" The phrase might have holes picked in\r\nit by a composition-master or -monger.[480] Thackeray is often liable to\r\nthis process. But it states an eternal verity, and so marks an essential\r\ndifferentia.\r\n\r\nThis differentia is what the present writer has, in many various forms,\r\nendeavoured to make good in respect of the novels and the novelists with\r\nwhich and whom he has dealt in this book, and in many books and articles\r\nfor the last forty years and more. There are the characters who never\r\nmight or could have been--the characters who, by limp and flaccid\r\ndrawing; by the lumping together of \"incompossibilities\"; by slavish\r\nfollowing of popular models; by equally slavish, though rather less\r\nignoble, carrying out of supposed rules; by this, that, and the other\r\nwant or fault, have deprived themselves of the fictitious right to live,\r\nor to have lived, though they occupy the most ghastly of all limbos and\r\nthe most crowded shelves of all circulating libraries. At the other end\r\nof the scale are the real men and women of fiction--those whom more or\r\nless (for there are degrees here as everywhere) you _know_, whose life\r\nis as your life, except that you live by the grace of God and they by\r\nthat of God's artists. These exist in all great drama, poetry, fiction;\r\nand it never would cause you the least surprise or feeling of\r\nunfamiliarity if they passed from one sphere to the other, and you met\r\nthem--to live with, to love or to hate, to dance or to dine with, to\r\nmurder (for you would occasionally like to kill them) or to marry.[481]\r\nBut between the two--and perhaps the largest crowd of the three, at\r\nleast since novel-writing came to be a business--is a vast multitude of\r\nfigures occupying a middle position, sometimes with little real vitality\r\nbut with a certain stage-competence; sometimes quite reaching the\r\n\"might-have-been,\" but never the full substance of \"has been\" for us. To\r\nthese last, I think, though to a high division of them, do Zola's\r\ncharacters belong.\r\n\r\nOf plot I never care to say very much, because it is not with me a\r\nwedding-garment, though I know an ugly or ill-fitting one when I see it,\r\nand can say, \"Well tailored or dress-made!\" in the more satisfactory\r\ncircumstances. Moreover, Zola hardly enters himself for much competition\r\nhere. There is none in the first two Apocalypses; _Vérité_ has what it\r\nhas, supplied by the \"case\" and merely adjusted with fair skill; the\r\n_Trois Villes_ lie quite outside plot; and the huge synoptic scheme of\r\nthe Rougon-Macquart series deals little with it in individual books. Of\r\nconversation one might say very much what has been said of character.\r\nThe books have the conversation which they require, and sometimes (in\r\nexamples generally even more difficult to quote than that of Nana's\r\ngiven above) a little more. But in Description, the Naturalist leader\r\nrises when he does not fall. It is obviously here that the boredom and\r\nthe beastliness of the details offend most. But it is also by means of\r\ndescription that almost all the books well spoken of before, from the\r\ntoo earthly Paradise of _L'Abbé Mouret_ to the Inferno of _Travail_,\r\nproduce some of their greatest effects.\r\n\r\nSo let this suffice as banning for what is bad in him, and as blessing\r\nfor what is good, in regard to Émile Zola: a great talent--at least a\r\nfailure of a genius--in literature; a marvellous worker in literary\r\ncraft. As for his life, it can be honestly avowed that the close of it,\r\nin something like martyrdom, had little or nothing to do with the fact\r\nthat the writer's estimate of his work changed, from very unfavourable,\r\nto the parti-coloured one given above. Until about 1880 I did not read\r\nhis books regularly as they came out, and the first \"nervous impression\"\r\nof what I did read required time and elaboration to check and correct,\r\nto fill in and to balance it. I have never varied my opinion that his\r\nmethods and principles--with everything of that sort--were wrong. But I\r\nhave been more and more convinced that his practice sometimes came\r\nastonishingly near being right.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy introduction to the greatest of M. Zola's associates was more\r\nfortunate, for it was impossible to mistake the quality of the new\r\nplanet.[482] One day in 1880 the editor of a London paper put into my\r\nhands a copy of a just-issued volume of French verse, which had been\r\nspecially sent to him by his Paris correspondent in a fit of moral\r\nindignation. It was entitled _Des Vers_, and the author of it was a\r\ncertain Guy de Maupassant, of whom I then knew nothing. The\r\ncorrespondent had seen in it a good opportunity for a denunciation of\r\nFrench wickedness; and my editor handed it over to me to see what was to\r\nbe done with it. I saw no exceptional wickedness, and a very great deal\r\nof power; indeed, though I was tolerably familiar with French verse and\r\nprose of the day, it seemed to me that I had not seen so much promise in\r\nany new writer since Baudelaire's death;[483] and I informed my editor\r\nthat, though I had not the slightest objection to blessing Maupassant, I\r\ncertainly would not curse him. He thought the blessing not likely to\r\nplease his public, while it would annoy his correspondent, and on my\r\nrepresentation declined to have anything to do with the cursing. So\r\n_nous passasmes oultre_, except that, like Mr. Bludyer, I \"impounded\"\r\nthe book; but, unlike him, did not either sell it, dine off it, or abuse\r\nthe author.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, I think, the _Soirées de Médan_ reached me, and this\r\nvery remarkable person appeared likewise, but in a new character.\r\nCertainly no one can ever have shown to better advantage in company than\r\nM. de Maupassant did on this occasion. _L'Attaque du Moulin_, which\r\nopened the volume, has already been spoken of as part of the best of all\r\nM. Zola's voluminous work. But as for the works of the young men, other\r\nthan M. de Maupassant, they had the Naturalist faults in fullest\r\nmeasure, unredeemed by their master's massive vigour and his desperate\r\nintensity. The contribution of M. Huysmans, in particular (_v. inf._)\r\nhas always appeared to me one of those voluntary or involuntary\r\ncaricatures, of the writer's own style and school, which are well known\r\nat all times, and have never been more frequent than recently. But\r\n_Boule de Suif_? Among the others that pleasant and pathetic person was\r\nnot a _boule_; she was a pyramid, a Colossus, a spire of Cologne\r\nCathedral. Putting the unconventionality of its subject aside, there is\r\nabsolutely no fault to be found with the story. It is as round and\r\nsmooth as \"Boule de Suif\" herself.\r\n\r\nMaupassant's work is of very substantial bulk. Of the verse enough for\r\nour purpose has been or will be said, though I should like to repeat\r\nthat I put it much higher than do most of Maupassant's admirers. The\r\nvolumes of travel-sketches do not appear to me particularly successful,\r\ndespite the almost unsurpassed faculty of their writer for sober yet\r\nvivid description. They have the air of being written to order, and they\r\ndo not seem, as a rule, to arrive at artistic completeness either\r\nobjectively or subjectively. Of the criticism, which concerns us more\r\nnearly, by far the most remarkable piece is the famous Preface to\r\n_Pierre et Jean_ (to be mentioned again below), which contains the\r\nauthor's literary creed, refined and castigated by years of practice\r\nfrom the cruder form which he had already promulgated in the Preface to\r\nFlaubert's _Correspondence with George Sand_. It extols the \"objective\"\r\nas against the psychological method of novel-writing, but directs itself\r\nmost strongly against the older romance of plot, and places the\r\nexcellence of the novelist in the complete and vivid projection of that\r\nnovelist's own particular \"illusion\" of the world, yet so as to present\r\nevents and characters in the most actual manner. But, as promised, we\r\nshall return to it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Bel-Ami._]\r\n\r\nTo run through the actual \"turn-out\" in novel[484] and tale as far as is\r\npossible here, _Bel-Ami_ started, in England at least, with the most\r\nfavouring gales possible. It was just when the decree had gone forth,\r\nissued by the younger Later Victorians, that all the world should be\r\nmade naughty; that the insipid whiteness of their Early and Middle\r\nelders should be washed black and scarlet, and especially \"blue\"; and\r\nthat if possible, by this and other processes, something like real\r\nliterature might be made to take the place of the drivellings and\r\nbotcheries of Tennyson and Browning; of Dickens and Thackeray; of Ruskin\r\nand Carlyle. To these persons _Bel-Ami_ was a sweet content, a really\r\n\"_shady_ boon.\" The hero never does a decent thing and never says a good\r\none; but he has good looks and insinuating manners of the kind that\r\nplease some women, whence his name, originally given to him by an\r\ninnocent little girl, and taken up by her by no means innocent mamma and\r\nother quasi-ladies.[485] He starts as a soldier who has served his time\r\nin Algeria, but has found nothing better to do than a subordinate post\r\nin a railway office. He meets a former comrade who is high up in Paris\r\njournalism, and who very amiably introduces Georges Duroy to that bad\r\nresting-place but promising passageway. Duroy succeeds, not so much\r\n(though he is not a fool) by any brains as by impudence; by a faculty of\r\nmaking use of others; by one of the farce-duels in which combatants are\r\nput half a mile off each other to fire _once_, etc.; but most of all by\r\nhis belamyship (for the word is good old English in a better sense). The\r\nwomen of the book are what is familiarly called \"a caution.\" They revive\r\nthe old Hélisenne de Crenne[486] \"sensual appetite\" for the handsome\r\nbounder; and though of course jealous of his infidelities, are quite\r\nready to welcome the truant when he returns. They also get drunk at\r\nrestaurant dinners, and then call their lovers--quite correctly, but not\r\nagreeably--\"Cochon!\" \"Sale bête,\" etc. This of course is what our\r\n_fin-de-siècle_ critics _could_ \"recommend to a friend.\"\r\n\r\nBut if the reader thinks that this summary is a prelude to anything like\r\nthe \"slate\" that I thought it proper to bestow upon _Les Liaisons\r\nDangereuses_, or even to such remarks as those made on the Goncourts, he\r\nis quite mistaken. Laclos had, as it seemed to me, a disgusting subject\r\nand no real compensation of treatment. In _Bel-Ami_ the merits of the\r\ntreatment are very great. The scenes pass before you; the characters\r\nplay their part in the scenes--if not in an engaging manner, in a\r\ncompletely life-like one. There is none of the _psychologie de\r\ncommande_, which I object to in Laclos, but a true adumbration of life.\r\nThe music-hall opening; the first dinner-party; the journalist scenes;\r\nthe death of Forestier and the proposal of re-marriage over his\r\ncorpse;[487] the honeymoon journey to Normandy--a dozen other\r\nthings--could not be better done in their way, though this way may not\r\nbe the best. It did not fall to me to review _Bel-Ami_ when it came out,\r\nbut I do not think I should have made any mistake about it if it had.\r\nThere are weak points technically; for instance, the character of\r\nMadeleine Forestier, afterwards Duroy--still later caught in flagrant\r\ndelict and divorced--is left rather enigmatic. But the general technique\r\n(with the reservations elsewhere made) is masterly, and two passages--a\r\nVigny-like[488] descant on Death by the old poet Norbert de Varenne and\r\nthe death-scene of Forestier itself--give us Maupassant in that mood of\r\n_macabre_ sentiment--almost Romance--which chequers and purifies his\r\nNaturalism.\r\n\r\nBut the main objection which I should take to the book is neither\r\ntechnical nor goody. The late Mr. Locker, in, I think, that most\r\nfascinating \"New Omniana\" _Patchwork_,[489] tells how, in the\r\nTravellers' Club one day, a haughty member thereof expressed surprise\r\nthat he should see Mr. Locker going to the corner-house next door. The\r\namiable author of _London Lyrics_ was good enough to explain that some\r\nnot uninteresting people also used the humbler establishment--bishops,\r\nauthors, painters, cabinet-ministers, etc. \"Ah!\" said the Traverser of\r\nPerilous Ways, \"that would be all very well if one _wanted_ to meet that\r\nsort of people. But, you see, one _doesn't_ want to meet them.\" Now, I\r\ndo not want to meet anybody in _Bel-Ami_; in fact, I would much rather\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Une Vie._]\r\n\r\n_Une Vie_ is, in this respect and others, a curious pendant to\r\n_Bel-Ami_. It illustrates another side of Maupassant's pessimism--the\r\novertly, but for the most part quietly, tragic. It might almost\r\n(borrowing a second title from the _Index_) call itself \"Jeanne; ou Les\r\nMalheurs de la Vertu.\" The heroine is perfectly innocent, though both a\r\n_femmelette_ and a fool. She never does any harm, nor, except through\r\nweakness and folly, deserves that any should be done to her. But she has\r\nan unwise and not blameless though affectionate and generous father,\r\nwith a mother who is an invalid, and whom, after her death, the daughter\r\ndiscovers to have been, in early days, no better than she should be.\r\nBoth of them are, if not exactly spendthrifts, \"wasters,\" very mainly\r\nthrough careless and excessive generosity. She marries the first young\r\nman of decent family, looks, and manners that she comes across; and he\r\nturns out to be stingy, unfaithful in the most offensive way, with her\r\nown maid and others, and unkind. She loses him, by the vengeance of a\r\nhusband whom he has wronged, and her second child is born dead in\r\nconsequence of this shock. Her first she spoils for some twenty years,\r\ntill he goes off with a concubine and nearly ruins his mother. We leave\r\nher consoling herself, in a half-imbecile fashion, with a grandchild.\r\nHer only earthly providence is her _bonne_ Rosalie, the same who had\r\nbeen her husband's mistress, but a very \"good sort\" otherwise. The book\r\nis charged with grime of all kinds. It certainly cannot be said of M. de\r\nMaupassant, to alter the pronoun in Mr. Kipling's line, that \"[_He_]\r\nnever talked obstetrics when the little stranger came,\" for _Une Vie_\r\ncontains two of these delectable scenes; and in other respects we are\r\ntreated with the utmost \"candour.\" But the book is again saved by some\r\nwonderful passages--specially those giving Jeanne's first night at the\r\nsea-side _château_ which is to be her own, and her last visit to it a\r\nquarter of a century after, when it has passed to strangers--and\r\ngenerally by the true tragedy which pervades it. When Maupassant took\r\nSorrow into cohabitation and collaboration, there was no danger of the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n_Mont-Oriol_, though not, save in one respect, the most \"arresting\" of\r\nMaupassant's books, has rather more varied and at the same time coherent\r\ninterest than some others. It is also that one which most directly\r\nillustrates--on the great scale--the general principles of the\r\nNaturalist school. Not, indeed, in specially grimy fashion, though there\r\nis the usual adultery (_not_ behind the scenes) and the (for Maupassant)\r\nnot unusual _accouchement_. (His fondness for this most unattractive\r\nepisode of human life is astonishing: if he were a more pious person and\r\na political feminist, one might think that he was trying to make us\r\nmodern Adams share the curse of Eve, at least to the extent of the\r\ndisgust caused by reading about its details.) The main extra-amatory\r\ntheme throughout is the \"physiologie\" of an inland watering-place, its\r\nextension by the discovery of new springs, the financing of them, the\r\njealousies of the doctors, the megrims of the patients, etc. All these\r\nare treated quite on the Zolaesque scheme, but with a lightness and\r\nbeauty not often reached by the master, though common enough in the\r\npupil.[490] The description of Christiane Andermatt's first bath, and\r\nthe sensations of mild bliss that it gave her, is as true as it is\r\npretty; and others of scenery have that vividness without\r\nover-elaboration which marks their author's work. Nor are his\r\nironic-human touches wanting. Almost at its birth he satirises, in his\r\nown quiet Swiftian way, an absurd tendency which has grown mightily\r\nsince, and flourishes now: \"'Très _moderne_'--entre ses lèvres, était le\r\ncomble de l'admiration.\" As for the love-affair itself, one's feelings\r\ntowards it are mixed. A good deal of it shows that unusual grasp of the\r\nproper ways of the game with which Maupassant is fully credited here.\r\nPersonally, I should not, after quoting Baudelaire to a lady (so far so\r\ngood), inform her that I was a donkey for expecting her to enjoy\r\nanything so subtle. But perhaps Paul Brétigny, though neglectful of the\r\nSeventh Commandment, was an honester man than I am. And it is quite true\r\nthat Christiane was _not_ subtle. Her hot lover's[491] cooling partly\r\ndated from the time when she expected him to show palpable interest in\r\nthe fact that she was likely to have a child by him. And though her cry\r\n(on the question what name this infant, of course accepted as his own by\r\nthe unfortunate Andermatt, should bear) that as for _her_ name, \"Celà\r\npromet trop de souffrances de porter le nom du Crucifié,\" could not be\r\nbetter as a general sentiment, the particular circumstances in which it\r\nis uttered show a slight want of grace of congruity. Still, the minor\r\ncharacters are not only more in number, but more interesting than is\r\nalways the case; and the book, if you skip the obstetrics, is readable\r\nthroughout. Yet it is, to use wine-language, not above \"Maupassant\r\n_premier bourgeois_,\" except in some of the earlier love-scenes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fort comme la Mort._]\r\n\r\nIn _Fort comme la Mort_ the author rises far above these two books,\r\npowerful as they are in parts. The basis is indeed the invariable and\r\nunsatisfactory \"triangle.\" But the structure built on it might almost\r\nhave been lifted to another, and stands foursquare in nearly all\r\nrespects of treatment. The chief technical objection that can be brought\r\nagainst it is that there is a certain want of air and space; the\r\nimportant characters are too few, the situations too uniform; so that a\r\nkind of oppression results. Olivier Bertin, one of the most popular of\r\nParisian painters though no longer young, a great man of society, etc.,\r\nhas, for many years, been the lover of the Countess de Guilleroy, and,\r\nof course, the dear friend of her husband. We are introduced to them\r\njust at the time when a sort of disgust of middle age is coming over\r\nhim, as well as a certain feeling that the springs of his genius are\r\nrunning low. He is not tired of the Countess, who is passionately\r\ndevoted to him; and, except that they do not live together, their\r\nrelations are rather conjugal than anything else. Just at this moment\r\nher daughter Annette comes home from a country life with her\r\ngrandmother, and proves to be the very double of what her mother was in\r\nher own youth. Bertin, without ceasing to love the mother, conceives a\r\nfrantic passion for the daughter; and the vicissitudes of this take up\r\nthe book. At last the explosives of the situation are \"fused,\" as one\r\nmay say, by one of the newspaper attacks of youth on age. Annette's\r\napproaching marriage, and this _Figaro_ critique of his own\r\n\"old-fashioned\" art, put Bertin beside himself. Either hurrying\r\nheedlessly along, or deliberately exposing himself, he is run over by an\r\nomnibus, is mortally hurt, and dies with the Countess sitting beside him\r\nand receiving his last selfishness--a request that she will bring the\r\ngirl to see him before he dies.\r\n\r\nThe story, though perhaps, as has been said, too much concentrated as a\r\nwhole, is brilliantly illuminated by sketches of society on the greater\r\nand smaller scale: of Parisian club-life; of picture-shows; of the\r\ndiversions of the country, etc.: but its effect, though certainly helped\r\nby, is not derived from, these. As always with Maupassant, it is out of\r\nthe bitter that comes the sweet. Hardly anywhere outside of\r\n_Ecclesiastes_, Thackeray,[492] and Flaubert is the irony of life more\r\nconsummately handled in one peculiar fashion; while the actual _passion_\r\nof love is nowhere better treated by this author,[493] or perhaps by\r\nany other French novelist of the later century, except Fromentin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Pierre et Jean._]\r\n\r\nThe line of ascent was continued in _Pierre et Jean_. It is not a long\r\nbook--a fact which perhaps has some significance--and no small part of\r\nit is taken up by a Preface on \"Le Roman\" generally (_v. sup._), which\r\nis the author's most remarkable piece of criticism; one of the most\r\nnoteworthy from a man who was not specially a critic; and one of the few\r\nbut precious examples of an artist dealing, at once judicially and\r\nmasterfully, with his own art.[494] In fact, recognising the truth of\r\nthe \"poetic moment,\" he would extend it to the moments of all\r\nliterature; and lays it down that the business of the novelist is, first\r\nto realise his own illusion of the world and then to make others realise\r\nit too.\r\n\r\n_Pierre et Jean_ itself has no weakness except that _narrowing_ of\r\ninterest which has been already noted in Maupassant, and which is rather\r\na limitation than a positive fault. There is practically one situation\r\nthroughout; and though there are several characters, their interest\r\ndepends almost wholly on their relations with the central personage.\r\nThis is Pierre Roland, a full-fledged physician of thirty, but not yet\r\nsuccessful, and still living with, and on, his parents. His father is a\r\nretired Paris tradesman, who has come to live at Havre to indulge a\r\nmania for sea-fishing; he has a mother who is rather above her husband\r\nin some ways; and a brother, Jean, who, though considerably younger, is\r\nalso ready to start in his own profession--that of the law. A \"friend of\r\nthe family,\" Mme. Rosémilly--a young, pretty, and rather well-to-do\r\nwidow--completes the company, with one or two \"supers.\" Just as the\r\nstory opens, a large legacy to Jean by an older friend of the\r\nfamily--this time a man--is announced, to the surprise of almost\r\neverybody, but at first only causing a little natural jealousy in\r\nPierre. Charitable remarks of outsiders, however, suggest to him the\r\ntruth--that Jean is the fruit of his mother's adultery with the\r\ntestator--and this \"works like poison in his brain,\" till--Jean, having\r\ngained another piece of luck in Mme. Rosémilly's hand, and having,\r\nthough enlightened by Pierre and by his mother's confession, very\r\ncommon-sensibly decided that he will not resign the legacy, smirched as\r\nit is--Pierre accepts a surgeon-ship on a Transatlantic steamer, and the\r\nstory ends.\r\n\r\nOn its own scheme and showing there is scarcely a fault in it. The mere\r\nsettings--the fishing and prawn-catching; the scenery of port and cliff;\r\nthe \"interiors\"; the final sailing of the great ship--are perfect. The\r\nminor characters--the good-tempered, thick-headed _bourgeois_ husband\r\nand father; the wife and mother, with her bland acceptance of the\r\ntransferred wages of shame, and (after discovery only) her breaking down\r\nwith the banal blasphemy of \"marriage before God\" and the rest of it;\r\nthe younger brother--not exactly a bad fellow, but thoroughly convinced\r\nof the truth of _non olet_; the widow playing her part and no more,--all\r\nare artistically just what they should be. And so, always remembering\r\nscale and scheme, is Pierre. One neither likes him (for he is not\r\nexactly a likeable person) nor dislikes him (for he is quite excusable)\r\nvery much; one is only partially sorry for him. But one knows that he\r\n_is_--he has that actual and indubitable existence which is the test and\r\nquality alike of creator and creation. His first vague envy of his\r\nbrother's positive luck in money and probable luck in love--for both\r\nhave had floating fancies for the pretty widow; the again perfectly\r\nnatural spleen when this lucky brother, by an accident, secures the\r\nparticular set of rooms in which Pierre had hoped to improve his\r\nposition as a doctor; the crushing blow of finding out his mother's\r\nshame; the process (the truest thing in the whole book, though it is all\r\ntrue) by which he tortures both her and himself in constant oblique\r\nreferences to her fault; the explosion when he directly informs his\r\nbrother; and all the rest, could hardly be improved. It is not a novel\r\non the great scale, but rather what may be called a long short story. It\r\ndoes not quite attain to the position of some books on a small scale in\r\ndifferent kinds--_Manon Lescaut_ itself, _Adolphe_, _La Tentation de\r\nSaint-Antoine_. But the author has done what he meant to do, and has\r\ndone it in such a fashion that it could not, on its own lines, be done\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nMaupassant's last novel of some magnitude, _Notre Coeur_, was written\r\nwhen the shadow was near enveloping him; and it cannot be said to have\r\nthe perfection of _Pierre et Jean_. But it still rises higher in certain\r\nvery important ways--it is perhaps the book that one likes him best for,\r\noutside of pure comedy; and there is none which impresses one more with\r\nthe sense of his loss to French literature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Notre Coeur._]\r\n\r\nThe story, like all Maupassant's stories, is of the simplest. André\r\nMariolle, a well-to-do young Parisian bachelor of no profession, is a\r\nmember of a set of mostly literary and artistic people, almost all of\r\nwhom have, as a main rendezvous, the house of a beautiful, wealthy, and\r\nvariously gifted young widow, Mme. de Burne. She lives chaperoned in a\r\nmanner by her father; indisposed to a second marriage by the fact that\r\nshe has had a tyrannical husband; accepting homage from all her\r\nfamiliars and being very gracious in differing degrees to all of them;\r\nbut having no \"lover in title\" and not even being suspected of having\r\n(in the French novel-sense[495]) any \"lover\" at all. For a long time\r\nMariolle has, from whim, refused introduction to her, but at last he\r\nconsents to be taken to the house by his friend the musician Massival,\r\nand of course falls a victim. It cannot be said that she is a\r\nCirce,[496] nor that, as perhaps might be expected, she revenges herself\r\nfor his holding aloof by snaring and throwing him away. Quite the\r\ncontrary. She shows him special favour: when she has to go to stay with\r\nfriends at Avranches she privately asks him to follow her; and finally,\r\nwhen the party pass the night at Mont Saint-Michel, she\r\ncomes--uninvited, though of course much longed for--to his room, and (as\r\nthey used to say with elaborate decency) \"crowns his flame.\" Nor does\r\nshe turn on him--as again might be expected--even then. On the contrary,\r\nshe comes constantly to a secret Eden which he has prepared for her in\r\nParis, and though, after long practice of this, she is sometimes rather\r\nlate, and once or twice actually puts off her assignation, it is \"no\r\nmore than reason,\"[497] and she by no means jilts or threatens jilting,\r\nthough she tells him frankly that his way of loving (which _is_ more\r\nthan reason) is not hers. At last he cannot endure seeing her surrounded\r\nwith admirers, and flies to Fontainebleau, where he is partly--only\r\npartly--consoled by a pretty and devoted _bonne_. Yet he sends a\r\ndespairing cry to Mme. de Burne; and she, gracious as ever, actually\r\ncomes to see him, and induces him to return to Paris. He does so, but\r\ntakes the _bonne_ Elisabeth with him; and the book ends abruptly,\r\nleaving the reader to imagine what is the outcome of this \"double\r\narrangement\"--or failure to arrange.\r\n\r\nBut, as always with Maupassant's longer stories and not quite never with\r\nhis shorter ones, the \"fable is the least part.\" The \"atmosphere\"; the\r\nprojection of character and passion; the setting; the situations; the\r\nphrase--these are the thing. And, except for the enigmatic and\r\n\"stump-ended\" conclusion, and for a certain overdose of words (which\r\nrather grew on him), they make a very fine thing. It is here that, on\r\none side at least, the author's conception of love--which at some times\r\nmight appear little more than animal, at others conventional-capricious\r\nin a fashion which makes that of Crébillon universal and sincere--has\r\nsublimed itself, as it had begun to do in _Fort comme la Mort_ (_Pierre\r\net Jean_ is in this respect something of a divagation), into very nearly\r\nthe true form of the Canticles and Shakespeare, of Donne and Shelley and\r\nHeine, of Hugo and Musset and Browning. But it is curious, in the first\r\nplace, that he whom his friends fondly called a _fier mâle_, who has\r\nsometimes pushed masculinity near to brutality, and who is always\r\ncynical more or less, has made his André Mariolle, though a very good\r\nlover, a distinct weakling in love. He is a \"too quick despairer,\" and\r\nhis despair is more illogical than even a lover's has a right to be. And\r\nthis is very interesting, because, evidently without the author's\r\nknowledge (though perhaps, if things had gone more happily, he might\r\nhave come to that knowledge later), it shows the rottenness of the\r\nfoundation, and the flimsiness of the superstructure, on and in which\r\nthe Covenant of Adultery--even that of Free Love--is built. Michelle de\r\nBurne gives André Mariolle everything with one exception, if even with\r\nthat, that the greediest lover can want. She \"distinguishes\" him at\r\nonce; she shows keen desire for his company; she makes the last (or\r\nfirst) surrender like a goddess answering a hopeless and unspoken\r\nprayer; she is strangely generous in continuing the _don d'amoureux\r\nmerci_; she never really wearies of or jilts him, though he is a most\r\nexacting lover; and when he has flung away from her she allows him, in\r\nthe most gracious manner, to whistle himself back. But there is one\r\nthing, or rather two which are one, that she will not, or perhaps\r\ncannot, give him. It is the idealised passion which nature has denied to\r\nher, though not to him, and the absolute faithfulness and \"forsaking of\r\nall others\" proper to what?--to a perfect wife. So here, in the realms\r\nof spouse-breach, marriage is once more king, or rather the throne is\r\nfelt to be empty--the kingdom an anarchy--without it!\r\n\r\nThe lighter side of the matter reminds one of two celebrated\r\nutterances. The first is Paul de Florac's criticism on the Lady\r\nClara-Barnes-Highgate triangle, \"Do not adopt our institutions _à\r\ndemi_.\" Here the situation is topsy-turvied in the most curious fashion,\r\nfor it is the character of marriage that is desiderated in the absence\r\nthereof, and in a country where that character itself is scoffed at.\r\nFurther, it reminds one still more of Sydney Smith's excellent jest when\r\nLady Holland, having previously asked him to stay at Holland House, sent\r\nhim a formal invitation to dinner, for a day within the period of the\r\nlarger hospitality. This, said Sydney, was \"an attempt to combine the\r\nstimulus of gallantry with the security of connubial relations.\" That\r\nwas precisely the moon that Mariolle sighed for, and that his not\r\nexactly Artemis would not--indeed could not be expected to--give him.\r\n\r\nOf Michelle de Burne herself there is less to be said. The curious\r\nmisogyny which chequered Maupassant's gynomania seems to have tried hard\r\nto express itself in her portrait. It is less certain that it does. The\r\nother characters are quite subordinate, except the _bonne_ Elisabeth\r\n(who, promising as she is, merely makes her _début_) and a novelist,\r\nGaston de Lamarthe, who may sometimes be taken as the author's\r\nmouthpiece, but who does not do him justice. The book on the whole does\r\nmuch to confirm, and hardly anything to invalidate, the position that\r\nits writer had far more to say than he ever said.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Les Dimanches_, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary list of Maupassant's \"Romans,\" as distinct from \"Nouvelles\"\r\nand \"Contes,\" ends with _Les Dimanches d'un Bourgeois de Paris_. This,\r\nhowever, is merely a series of tales (some of them actually rehandled\r\nfrom earlier ones), with a single figure for centre, to wit, a certain\r\nM. Patissot, a bachelor government-official, who is a sort of mixture of\r\nLeech's Mr. Briggs and of Jérôme Paturot, with other predecessors who\r\nget into scrapes and \"fixtures.\" It is not unamusing, but scarcely\r\nfirst-class, the two political skits at the end being about the best\r\npart of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Yvette._]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, _Yvette_, which is only allowed the eponymship of a\r\nvolume of short stories, though it fills to itself some hundred and\r\nseventy pages, is one of Maupassant's most carefully written things and\r\none of his best--till the not fully explained, but in any case\r\nunsatisfactory, end[498]. Its heroine is the daughter of a sham Marquise\r\nand real courtesan, who has attained wealth, who can afford herself\r\nlovers \"for love\"[499] and not for money, when she chooses, and who\r\nkeeps up a sort of demi-monde society, in which most of the men are\r\nadventurers and all the women adventuresses, but which maintains outward\r\ndecencies. In consequence of this Yvette herself--in a fashion a little\r\nimpossible, but artistically made not improbable--though she allows\r\nherself the extreme \"tricks and manners\" of faster society, calls half\r\nthe men by nicknames, wanders about alone with them, etc., preserves not\r\nmerely her personal purity but even her ignorance of unclean things in\r\ngeneral, and especially of her mother's real character and conduct. Her\r\nrelations with a clever and not ungentlemanly _roué_, one M. de\r\nServigny; his difficulties (these are very curiously and cleverly told)\r\nin making love to a girl not of the lower class (at least apparently)\r\nand not vicious; his attempt to brusque the matter; her horror at it and\r\nat the coincident discovery of her mother's ways; her attempt to poison\r\nherself; and her salvage by Servigny's coolness and devotion--are\r\ncapitally done. Out of many passages, one, where Madame la Marquise\r\nObardi, otherwise Octavie Bardin, formerly domestic servant, drops her\r\nmask, opens her mouth, and uses the crude language of a procuress-mother\r\nto her daughter, is masterly. But the end is not from any point of view\r\nsatisfactory. Apparently (for it is not made quite clear) Yvette\r\nretracts her refusal to be a kept mistress. In that case certainly, and\r\nin the almost impossible one of marriage probably, it may be feared that\r\nthe catastrophe is only postponed. Now Yvette has been made too good (I\r\ndo not mean goody) to be allowed to pine or poison herself, as a\r\nsoon-to-be-neglected concubine or a not-much-longer-to-be-loved wife.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Short stories--the various collections.]\r\n\r\nThat the very large multitude[500] of his short stories (or, one begs\r\npardon, brief-narratives) is composed of units very different in merit\r\nis not wonderful. It was as certain that the covers of the author of\r\n_Boule de Suif_[501] would be drawn for the kind of thing frequently, as\r\nthat these would sometimes be drawn either blank, or with the result of\r\na very indifferent run. To an eye of some expertness, indeed, a good\r\nmany of these pieces are, at best, the sort of thing that a clever\r\ncontributor would turn off to editorial order, when he looked into a\r\nnewspaper office between three and five, or ten and midnight. I confess\r\nthat I once burst out laughing when, having thought to myself on reading\r\none, \"This is not much above a better written Paul-de-Kockery,\" I found\r\nat the end something like a frank acknowledgment of the fact, _with the\r\nname_. In fact, Maupassant was not good at the pure _grivoiserie_; his\r\ncontemporary M. Armand Silvestre (_v. inf._) did it much better. Touches\r\nof tragedy, as has been said, save the situation sometimes, and at\r\nothers the supernatural element of dread (which was to culminate in _Le\r\nHorla_, and finally to overpower the author himself) gives help; but the\r\nzigzags of the line of artistic success are sharp and far too numerous.\r\nFor a short story proper and a \"proper\" short story, _L'Épave_, where an\r\ninspector of marine insurance visits a wreck far out on the sands of the\r\nIsle of Rhé, and, finding an Englishman and his daughter there, most\r\nunprofessionally forgets that the tides come up rapidly in such places,\r\nis nearly perfect. On the other hand, _Le Rosier de Mme. Husson_, one of\r\nthe longest, is almost worthless.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Classes--stories of 1870-71.]\r\n\r\nAt one time I had designed--and to no small extent written--a running\r\nsurvey of a large number of these stories as they turn up in the\r\nvolumes, most of which--the _Contes de la Bécasse_ is the chief\r\nexception--have no unity, and are merely \"scoopings\" of pieces enough to\r\nfill three hundred pages or so. But it would have occupied far too much\r\nspace for its importance and interest. As a matter of fact, they are to\r\nsome extent classifiable, and so may be dealt with on a representative\r\nsystem. There is the division of \"La Revanche,\" which might have saved\r\nsome of our fools at home from mistaking the Prussian for anything but a\r\nPrussian. _Boule de Suif_ heads this, of course; but _Mlle. Fifi_, which\r\nis a sort of tragic _Boule de Suif_--the tragedy being, one is glad to\r\nsay, at the invaders' expense--is not far below it. _Deux Amis_, one of\r\nthe best, records how two harmless Parisian anglers, pursuing their\r\nbeloved sport too far, were shot for refusing to betray the password\r\nback; and _La Mère Sauvage_, the finest of all, how a French mother,\r\nhearing of her son's death, burnt her own house with some Germans\r\nbilleted in it, and was, on her frank confession, shot. But _Un Duel_,\r\nthough a Prussian officer (_vile damnum_) pays for his brutality with\r\nhis life, restores the comic element, partly at the expense of the two\r\nEnglish seconds.[502]\r\n\r\nConnected with the war of 1870 too, though not military, is the capital\r\n_Coup d'État_, in which a Monarchist French squire checkmates, for the\r\nmoment at least, a blatant Republican village doctor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Norman stories.]\r\n\r\nVery much larger than any other group is, naturally enough, that on\r\nNorman subjects. Maupassant does not flatter his fellow-subjects of the\r\ngreat Duchy, but he loves them, and knows them, and delights to talk of\r\nthem--talking always well and often at his best. There must be, in all,\r\nseveral volumes-full of these, though they are actually scattered over a\r\ndozen: and it is not easy to go wrong with them. Perhaps a new \"Farce du\r\nCuvier,\" quite different from those known to readers of Boccaccio and\r\nthe Fabliaux (a very drunk peasant sells his wife[503] by weight or\r\nmeasure to another, and scientifically ascertains the exact sum to be\r\npaid by making her fill a butt with water and putting her into it--the\r\ndisplacement giving the required result) is the merriest. The story of\r\nthe schoolboy who negotiates a marriage between his Latin tutor and a\r\nyoung person is excellent; and that of \"Boitelle,\" a poor fellow who is\r\nprevented (through that singular abuse of _patria potestas_ so long\r\nallowed by French law) from marrying an agreeable negress, is the most\r\npathetic. But I myself am rather fond of the _Légende du Mont\r\nSaint-Michel_. At first one is a little shocked at finding \"the great\r\nvision of the guarded mount\"[504] yoked to the old Scandinavian\r\ntroll-and-farmer story of the fraudulent bargain as to alternate upper-\r\nand under-ground crops. But the magnificent opening description of \"the\r\nfairy castle planted in the sea\"[505] excuses, and is thrown up by, the\r\nsequel. Mont-Saint-Michel is not like Naples. When you have seen it, it\r\nis not your business to die, but to live and remember the sight of it;\r\nand, if you are lucky, your remembrance will have anticipated\r\nMaupassant's words, and be freshened by them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Algerian and Sporting.]\r\n\r\nAlgiers and the Riviera were also fruitful in quantity, rather less so\r\nin quality. But on the former two stories, _Allouma_ and _Au Soir_, may\r\nbe found together, the whole of the first of which, and the beginning of\r\nthe second, are first-rate. The above mentioned _Contes de la Bécasse_\r\nare almost all good, though by no means all sporting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Purely comic.]\r\n\r\nFor pure comedy one might put as the first three--with the caution that\r\nMrs. Grundy had better keep away from them--_Les Soeurs Rondoli_,[506]\r\nfor which I feel certain that, when Maupassant reached the Elysian\r\nFields, Aristophanes and Rabelais jointly requested the pleasure of\r\nintroducing him to the company, and crowned him with the choicest\r\nlaurels; _Mouche_, which is really touching as well as tickling at the\r\nend, though the grave and precise must be doubly warned off this; and\r\n_Enragée_--which is a sort of blend of an old smoking-room story of the\r\nperils of the honeymoon when new, and that curious tale[507] of Vigny's\r\nwhich has been given above.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tragic.]\r\n\r\nFor pure, or almost pure, tragedy and pathos, again, _Monsieur Parent_\r\nstands first--the history of the late vengeance of a deceived husband\r\nand friend. _Miss Harriet_ gives us something more than a stage\r\nEnglishwoman with large feet, projecting teeth, tartan skirts, and\r\ntracts, though it gives us this too. _Madame Baptiste_--the very short\r\ntale of a hapless woman who, having been the victim of crime in her\r\nyouth, is pursued by the scandal thereof to suicide, in spite of her\r\nhaving found a worthy husband--is one of Maupassant's intensest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tales of Life's Irony.]\r\n\r\nAs examples, bending sometimes to the comic, sometimes to the pathetic\r\nside of studies in the irony of life, one may recommend _A Cheval_ (a\r\nholiday taken by a poor but well-born family, which saddles them with an\r\nunconscionable \"run-over\" Old-_Wo_man-of-the-_Land_); _La Parure_ and\r\n_Les Bijous_ (the first a variant of _A Cheval_, the second a discovery\r\nby a husband, after his wife's death, of her shame); and perhaps best of\r\nall, _Regret_, in which a gentleman of sixty, reflecting on his wasted\r\nlife, remembers a picnic, decades earlier, where the wife of his\r\nlifelong friend--both of them still friends and neighbours--behaved\r\nrather oddly. He hurries across to ask her (whom he finds jam-making)\r\nwhat she would have done if he had \"failed in respect,\" and receives the\r\ncool answer, \"J'aurais cédé.\" It is good; but fancy not being able to\r\ntake a walk, and observe the primroses by the river's brim, without\r\nbeing bound in honour to observe likewise whether the lady by your side\r\nwas ready to \"cede\" or not! It seems to me that in such circumstances\r\none would, to quote a French critic on an entirely different author and\r\nmatter, \"lose all the grace and liberty of the composition.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oddments.]\r\n\r\nSome oddments[508] may deserve addition. _Fini_, which might have been\r\nmentioned in the last group, is a very perfect thing. A well-preserved\r\ndandy in middle age meets, after many years, an old love, and sees,\r\nmirrored in _her_ decay, his own so long ignored. Nobody save a master\r\ncould have done this as it is done. _Julie Romain_ is a quaint\r\nhalf-dream based on some points in George Sand's life, and attractive.\r\nThe _title_ of _L'Inutile Beauté_ has also always been so to me (the\r\n_story_ is worth little). It would be, I think, a fair test of any man's\r\ntaste in style, whether he did or did not see any difference between it\r\nand _La Beauté Inutile_. In _Adieu_, I think, Maupassant has been guilty\r\nof a fearful heresy in speaking of part of a lady's face as \"ce _sot_\r\norgane qu'on appelle le nez.\" Now that a nose, both in man and woman,\r\ncan be foolish, nobody will deny. But that foolishness is an organic\r\ncharacteristic of it--in the sense of inexpressiveness, want of\r\ncharacter, want of charm--is flatly a falsehood.[509] Neither mouth nor\r\neyes can beat it in that respect; and if it has less variety\r\nindividually, it gives perhaps more general character to the face than\r\neither. However, he is, if I mistake not, obliged to retract partially\r\nin the very story.\r\n\r\nI have notes of many others--some of which may be special favourites\r\nwith readers of mine--but room for no more. Yet for me at least among\r\nall these, despite the glaring inequality, despite the presence of some\r\nthings utterly ephemeral and not in the least worth giving a new day to;\r\ndespite the \"_saleté_ bête\"[510] and the monotonous and obligatory\r\nadultery,[511] there abides, as in the large books, and from\r\ncircumstances now and then with gathered intensity, that quality of\r\nabove-the-commonness which has obliged me to speak of Maupassant as I\r\nhave spoken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General considerations.]\r\n\r\nThe vividness and actuality of his power of presentation are\r\nunquestioned, and there has been complaint rather of the character of\r\nhis \"illusions\" (_v. sup._) than of his failure to convey them to\r\nothers. It is not merely that nature, helped by the discipline of\r\npractice under the severest of masters, had endowed him with a style of\r\nthe most extraordinary sobriety and accuracy--the style of a more\r\nscholarly, reticent, and tightly-girt Defoe. It is not merely that his\r\nvision, and his capacity of reproducing that vision, were unsurpassed\r\nand rarely equalled for sharpness of outline and perfection of\r\ndisengagement. He had something else which it is much less easy to put\r\ninto words--the power of treating an incident or a character (character,\r\nit is true, less often and less fully than incident) as if it were a\r\nphrase or a landscape, of separating it, carving it out (so to speak),\r\nand presenting it isolated and framed for survey. His performances in\r\nthese tracks are so numerous that it is difficult to single out any. But\r\nI do not know that finer examples (besides those noticed above in _Une\r\nVie_) of his power of thus isolating and projecting a scene are to be\r\nfound than two of the passages in _Pierre et Jean_, the prawn-catching\r\nparty and Pierre's meditation at the jetty-head. Of his similar but\r\ngreater faculty of treating incident _and_ character _Monsieur Parent_\r\nis perhaps the very finest example (for _Boule de Suif_ is something\r\ngreater than a mere slice), though _Promenade_, _Les Soeurs Rondoli_,\r\n_Boitelle_, _Deux Amis_, and others are almost as good. But this very\r\nexcellence of our author's carries with it a danger which most of his\r\nreaders must have recognised. His definition and vignetting of separate\r\nscenes, incidents, and characters is so sharp and complete that he finds\r\na difficulty in combining them. The attempt to disdain and depreciate\r\nplot which the above-mentioned Preface contains is, I suspect (though I\r\nam, as often confessed, no plot-worshipper), as our disdains and\r\ndepreciations so often are, itself a confession. At any rate, it is\r\nallowed that the longer books, with the exception of _Pierre et Jean_\r\n(which was for that very reason, and perhaps for others, disdained by\r\nthe youngest and most impressionist school of critics), are deficient in\r\nbeginning, middle, and end. _Une Vie_ and _Bel-Ami_ are surveys or\r\nchronicles, not dramas or histories. _Mont-Oriol_, open enough to\r\nobjection in some ways, is rather better in this point. _Fort Comme la\r\nMort_ relapses under the old curse of the situation of teasing\r\nunhappiness from which there is no outlet, and in which there is little\r\naction. _Notre Coeur_ should perhaps escape criticism on this head, as\r\nthe shadow of the author's fate was already heavy on him. In fact, as\r\nobserved above, it is little more than a torso. Even _Pierre et Jean_,\r\nby far the greatest of all, if scale and artistic perfection be taken\r\ntogether, falls short in the latter respect of _Boule de Suif_, which,\r\nsmall as it is, is a complete tragi-comedy in little, furnished with\r\nbeginning, middle, and end, complying fully with those older exigences\r\nwhich its author affected to despise, and really as great as anything of\r\nMérimée's--greater it could not be.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the theory which Maupassant says he learnt from\r\nFlaubert (in whose own hands it was always subordinated to an effort at\r\nlarger completeness) does lead to the composition of a series or flock\r\nof isolated vignettes or scenes rather than to that of a great picture\r\nor drama. For it comes perilously close--though perhaps in Maupassant's\r\nown case it never actually reached--the barest and boldest (or baldest)\r\nindividualising of impressions, and leaving them as they are, without an\r\nattempt at architectonic. For instance, once upon a time[512] I was\r\nwalking down the Euston Road. There passed me a fellow dragging a\r\ntruck, on which truck there were three barrels with the heads knocked\r\nout, so that each barrel ensheathed, to a certain extent, the one in\r\nfront of it. Astride of the centre barrel, his arms folded and a pipe in\r\nhis mouth, there sat a man in a sort of sailor-costume--trousers,\r\nguernsey, and night-cap--surveying the world, and his fellow who dragged\r\nhim, with an air of placid _goguenarderie_. It was really a striking\r\nimpression, and absorbed me, I should think, for five or six seconds. I\r\ncan conceive its coming into a story very well. But Maupassant's\r\ntheories would have led to his making a whole story out of it, and his\r\nfollowers have already done things quite as bad, while he has himself\r\ncome near to it more than once.[513] In other words, the method tends to\r\nthe presentations of scraps, orts, fragments, instead of complete\r\nwholes. And Art should always seek the whole.\r\n\r\nAs for the character of Maupassant's \"illusions,\" there could never be\r\nmuch doubt about some of them. _Boule de Suif_ itself pretty clearly\r\nindicated, and _La Maison Tellier_ shortly after showed, at the very\r\nopening of his literary career, the scenes, the society, and the solaces\r\nwhich he most affected: while it was impossible to read even two or\r\nthree of his stories without discovering that, to M. de Maupassant, the\r\nworld was most emphatically _not_ the best of all possible worlds. This\r\nwas by no means principally shown in the stories of supernatural terror\r\nto which, with an inconsistency by no means uncommon in declared\r\nmaterialists, and, had it not been for his unhappy end, very amusing, he\r\nwas so much given. The chief of these, _Le Horla_, has not been much of\r\na favourite with the lovers of \"ghost-stories\" in general. I think they\r\nare rather unjust to it. But if it has a fault, that fault lies (and, to\r\navoid the charge of being wise after the event, I may observe that I\r\nthought so at the time) in too much conviction. The darkness is darkness\r\nwhich has been felt, and felt so much by the artist that he has lost\r\nhis artistic grasp and command. There was, perhaps, in his own actual\r\nstate, too much reason for this. In earlier things of the kind it is\r\nless perceptible. _Fou?_ is rather splendid. _Auprès d'un Mort_--an\r\nanecdote of the death-bed of Schopenhauer, whom Maupassant naturally\r\nadmired as the greatest of _saccageurs de rêves_, though there are some\r\nwho, admiring the first master of thoroughly good German prose style and\r\none of the best of German critics, have kept the fort of their dreams\r\nsafe from all he could do--has merits. _Lettre trouvée sur un noyé_ is\r\ngood; _L'Horrible_ not quite so good; _Le Loup_ (a sort of fancy from\r\nthe \"bête du Gévaudan\" story) better; _Apparition_ of the best, with _La\r\nMorte_ to pair it, and _Un Cas de Divorce_ and _Qui sait?_ to make up\r\nthe quartette. Perhaps the best of all (I do not specify its title in\r\norder that those who do not know it may read till they find it out) is\r\nthat where the visionary sees the skeletons of the dead rising and\r\ntransforming their lying epitaphs into confessions--the last tomb now\r\nbearing the true cause of his own mistress's death. But the\r\ndouble-titled _La Nuit--Cauchemar_ runs it hard.\r\n\r\nYet it is not in these stories of doubt and dread, or in the ostensible\r\nand rather shallow philosophisings of the travel-books, that\r\nMaupassant's pessimism is most obvious. His preference for the unhappy\r\nending amounts almost to a _tic_, and would amount wholly to a\r\nbore--for _toujours_ unhappy-ending is just as bad as _toujours_\r\nmarriage-bells--if it were not relieved and lightened by a real presence\r\nof humour. With this sovereign preservative for self, and more sovereign\r\ncharm for others, Guy de Maupassant was more richly provided than any of\r\nhis French contemporaries, and more than any but a very few of his\r\ncountrymen at any time. And as humour without tenderness is an\r\nimpossibility, so, too, he could be and was tender. Yet it was seldom\r\nand _malgré lui_, while he allowed the mere exercise of his humour\r\nitself too scantily for his own safety and his readers' pleasure. That\r\nthere was any more _fanfaronnade_ either of vice or of misanthropy\r\nabout him, I do not believe. An unfortunate conformity of innate\r\ntemperament and acquired theory made such a _fanfaronnade_ as\r\nunnecessary as it would have been repugnant to him. But illusion, in\r\nsuch cases, is more dangerous, if less disgusting, than imposture. And\r\nso it happened that, in despite of the rare and vast faculties just\r\nallowed him, he was constantly found applying them to subjects\r\ndistasteful if not disgraceful, and allowing the results to be sicklied\r\nover with a persistent \"soot-wash\" of pessimism which was always rather\r\nmonotonous, and not always very impressive.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, inevitable that, on this side of the Channel at\r\nleast, strictures should be passed--and appealed against--on a writer of\r\nthis kind. The impropriety of M. de Maupassant's subjects, the\r\n\"cruelty,\" the \"brutality,\" the \"pessimism,\" and what not, of his\r\nhandling, were sure to be denounced or defended, as the case may be.\r\nAlthough the merely \"shoking\" tone (as the spelling dear to Frenchmen\r\nhas it) has waned persistently ever since his day, expressions in it\r\nhave not been wanting; while, on the other hand, newer-fashioned and\r\nprobably younger censors have scornfully waved aside the very\r\nconsideration of this part of the subject. Further, no less a critic\r\nthan my friend Mr. Traill entered, long ago, a protest against the\r\nadmission of Maupassant's pessimism as a drawback. \"He did not,\" says\r\nMr. Traill (I quote from memory), \"_pose_ as a pessimist; he was\r\nperfectly sincere, and an artist's sincere life-philosophy, whatever it\r\nis, is not to be urged against the products of his art.\"\r\n\r\nI think that these questions require a little discussion, even in a\r\ngeneral _History_.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the impropriety matter, I have myself, after a\r\nlifetime of fighting against the _hérésie de l'enseignement_, not the\r\nvery slightest intention of deserting to or transacting with it. I do\r\nmost heartily agree and affirm that the subject of a work of art is not,\r\nas such, the better or the worse, the more or the less legitimate,\r\nbecause of its tastefulness or distastefulness on moral considerations.\r\nBut there is a perpetual danger, when we are clearing our minds of one\r\ncant, of allowing them to be invaded by another; and I think I have seen\r\ncases where the determination not to be moral of malice prepense has\r\nbeen so great that it has toppled over into a determination to be\r\nimmoral of malice prepense. Now, the question is, whether Maupassant and\r\nsome of Maupassant's admirers are not somewhat in this case? It is\r\nsurely impossible for any impartial critic to contend that the unlucky\r\nnovelist's devotion to the class of subjects referred to, and his manner\r\nof handling them, did not amount to what has been pedantically, but\r\naccurately, termed an \"obsession of the _lupanar_.\" Now, it seems to me\r\nthat all obsession, no matter of what class or kind, is fatal, or, at\r\nleast, injurious, to the artist. It is almost impossible that he should\r\nkeep his judgment and his taste cool and clear under it; it is almost\r\nimpossible that his poring shall not turn into preaching. And I think it\r\nnot much less hard to defend Maupassant from the charge of having become\r\na kind of preacher in this way, and so a heretic of instruction, just as\r\nmuch as if he had taken to theology, dogmatic or undogmatic. Perpetual\r\nrepresentation amounts to inculcation.[514]\r\n\r\nSo, again, in reference to the apologies for Maupassant's pessimism. I\r\ncannot see how it can be contended that the perpetual obtrusion of a\r\nlife-philosophy of any special kind is other than a fault in art. I have\r\nno particular objection to pessimism as such; I suppose most people who\r\nhave thought and felt a good deal are nearer to it than to its opposite;\r\nand, though both opposites bore me when they are obtruded, I think\r\nrose-pink and sky-blue bore me rather more than the various shades of\r\ngrey and brown and black. I admit further that, but for the pessimist\r\n_diathesis_, we might not have had that peculiar tragedy in which he\r\nhas been admitted to excel. But it seems to me that the creative artist,\r\nas such, and as distinguished from the critical, has no more business to\r\ndisplay--to _arborer_--a life-philosophy, than he has to display a\r\nphilosophy of any other kind. Signs of it may escape him at times; but\r\nthey should be escapes, not deliberate exhibitions. He is to see life\r\nwhole as far as he can; and it is impossible that he should see it whole\r\nif he is under the domination of any 'ism to the extent that Maupassant\r\nwas under the domination of this. In the one supreme artist (I am\r\ntalking, of course, throughout of the art of letters only) whom we know,\r\nthere is, perhaps, no more distinctive peculiarity than his elusion of\r\nall attempts to class him as \"Thissist\" or \"Thattist.\" And in those who\r\ncome nearest to him, though they may have strong beliefs and strong\r\nproclivities, we always see the capacity of taking the other side. The\r\nfervent theologian of the _Paradiso_ treats hardly any of his victims\r\nwith more consideration than the inhabitants of the City of Dis: the\r\nprophet and poet of his own Uranian love for Beatrice swoons at the\r\nsight of Francesca's punishment, and feels \"so that boiling glass were\r\ncoolness,\" the very penalty of the Seventh Circle of Purgatory. But\r\nMaupassant's materialism and his pessimism combined shut out from him\r\nvast parts and regions of life and thought and feeling, as it were with\r\nthe blank wall of his very earliest poem. The fantastic shadows of his\r\npeculiar imagination play on that wall fascinatingly enough; and the\r\nregion of passion and of gloom within is not without a charm, if a\r\nsomewhat unholy and unhealthy one. But beyond the wall there is a whole\r\nuniverse which Maupassant does not merely neglect, but of which he seems\r\nto be blankly ignorant and unconscious, except in flashes of ignorant\r\ndisdain. That the infinite province of religious emotion and reflection\r\nis shut out is a matter of course; but most of the other regions, in\r\nwhich those who decline religion take refuge, are equally closed. I can\r\nremember in Maupassant only the slightest signs of interest in general\r\nliterature (except so far as it bears upon his own special craft), in\r\nthe illimitable ranges of history, in politics, in the higher\r\nphilosophy.[515] It cannot be said of him, as of his master's dismal\r\nheroes, that _tout lui a craqué dans la main_. There is no sign of trial\r\non his part; he starts where Bouvard and Pécuchet end, and takes for\r\ngranted a failure which he has not given himself the trouble to\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be said, \"What does it matter what he does not do, know,\r\nfeel, care for, if he treats what he does do, know, feel, and care for,\r\nwell?\" The objection is ingenious, and, as Petruchio would say, \"'a\r\nmight have a little galled me\" if its ingenuity had not been the\r\ningenuity of fallacy. For the question is whether this insensibility to\r\nlarge parts of life has not injured Maupassant's treatment of the parts\r\nin which he did feel an interest. I think it has. There were too many\r\nthings in emotion and in thought of which he was ignorant. Mrs. Piozzi,\r\nin her _Anecdotes of Johnson_, observes that the Doctor, despite his\r\nfreedom from gush and his dislike to religious verse, could never repeat\r\nthe stanza of _Dies Irae_ which ends \"Tantus labor non sit cassus\"\r\nwithout bursting into tears. I know a person very different from Johnson\r\nwho, though he had not read the _Anecdotes_ till an advanced period of\r\nhis life, had never failed to experience something like the same result\r\nat the same line. And, for a third point, it is well known that actual\r\nagnostics have often confessed to like affections in similar cases. The\r\nnumerous and complicated causes of this weakness, or, if any one prefers\r\nto call them so, the numerous and complicated causes of this enjoyment,\r\nhad no hold whatever on Maupassant.\r\n\r\nBut this hemiplegia of the intellect and the imagination--this\r\nsterilising of one-half, or more than one-half, of the sources of\r\nintellectual and imaginative experience and delight--did not prevent him\r\nfrom leaving durable and perdurable results of the vigour of his mind\r\nand his sense, in the regions which were open to him. He wrote--as\r\nalmost every popular writer in these days who does not shut himself up\r\nin a _tour d'ivoire_ and neglect popularity must write--too much; and,\r\nin the special circumstances and limitations of his interests and his\r\ngenius, this was specially unfortunate. He repeated himself too often;\r\nand he too frequently failed to come up to himself in the repetition.\r\nThe better part of him, as with Flaubert before, transcended--even\r\nopenly contemned--the 'isms of his day: but he too often let himself be\r\nsubservient to them, if he was never exactly their Helot.\r\n\r\nYet in recompense--a recompense largely if not wholly due to the strong\r\nRomantic[516] element which countervails the Naturalist--he was\r\ncertainly the greatest novelist who was specially of the last quarter of\r\nthe nineteenth century in France. In verse he showed the dawn, and in\r\nprose the noon-day, of a combination of veracity and vigour, of\r\nsuccinctness and strength, which no Frenchman who made his _début_ since\r\n1870 could surpass. The limitations of his art have been sufficiently\r\ndealt with; the excellences of it within those limitations are\r\nunmistakable. He had no tricks--the worst curse of art at all times, and\r\nthe commonest in these days of what pretends to be art. He had no splash\r\nof so-called \"style\"; no acrobatic contortions of thought or what does\r\nduty for thought; no pottering and peddling of the psychological kind,\r\nwhich would fain make up for a faulty product by ostentatiously parading\r\nthe processes of production. Had he once got free--as more than once it\r\nseemed that he might--from the fatal conventionalities of his\r\nunconventionalism, from the trammels of his obtrusive negations, there\r\nis hardly a height in prose fiction which he might not have attained. As\r\nit is, he gave us in verse _Au bord de l'eau_, which is nearly the\r\n\"farthest possible\" in a certain expression, of a certain mood of youth,\r\nand not of youth only; in prose _Boule de Suif_, _Monsieur Parent_,\r\n_Pierre et Jean_, which are all in their way masterpieces, and a hundred\r\nthings hardly inferior. And so he put himself in the company of \"Les\r\nPhares\"--a light-giver at once and a warner of danger, as well as a part\r\nof\r\n\r\n        cet ardent sanglot qui roule d'âge en âge,\r\n    Et vient mourir au bord de _notre_ éternité.[517]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Huysmans.]\r\n\r\nThe Naturalist rank and file are so far below Zola and Maupassant that\r\nthey cannot now, whatever they might have done twenty years ago, claim\r\nmuch notice in such a history as this. The most remarkable of them was\r\nprobably J. K. Huysmans. It has been charitably suggested or admitted\r\nabove that his contribution to the _Soirées de Médan_--a deeply felt\r\nstory, showing the extreme disadvantage, when, as Mr. De la Pluche\r\ndelicately put it, \"your midlands are out of order,\" of wandering\r\nquarters and vicissitudes in the country, and the intense relief\r\nexperienced on return to your own comfortable chambers in town,--that\r\nthis _may_ have been written in the spirit of a _farceur_, reducing the\r\nGoncourtian and Zolaesque principle to the lowest terms of the absurd.\r\nBut I am by no means sure that it was so, though this suspicion of\r\nparody pursues the earlier work of Huysmans to such an extent that a\r\ncertain class of critic might take his later developments as evidence of\r\ndesign in it. _Les Soeurs Vatard_ is a sort of _apodiabolosis_ of the\r\nGoncourts and Zola--a history of entirely uninteresting persons (the\r\n\"sisters\" are work-girls in a printing-house, and their companions suit\r\nthem) doing entirely uninteresting things, in an atmosphere of foul\r\nsmells, on a scene littered with garbage, cheered by wine which is red\r\nink, and brandy which is vitriol. _À Rebours_, not really a novel at\r\nall, is the history of a certain M. Des Esseintes, who is a sort of\r\ntransposed \"Bouvard et Pécuchet\" in one--trying all arts and sensations;\r\nhis experiences being made by his historian a vehicle of mostly virulent\r\nand almost always worthless criticism on contemporaries. Perhaps the\r\nmost intolerable thing is the _affiche_ of idolatry for Baudelaire. One\r\nremembers the glorious lines:\r\n\r\n    Et Charles Baudelaire\r\n    Dédaigneux du salaire.\r\n\r\nHe certainly might have been disdainful of the salary of the admiration\r\nof one of the _farceurs_ of his own \"Coucher du Soleil Romantique.\" But\r\non the whole there is a better way of taking leave of this first\r\nNaturalist, and then mystic, and always _blagueur_. \"Almost thou\r\npersuadest me to be a Philistine.\" Which perhaps was his cryptic and\r\ncircuitous intention. Later M. Huysmans took to Black Arts; and at the\r\nlast he turned devout--a sort of sequence not by any means uncommon, and\r\none of the innumerable illustrations of the irony of things. Gautier and\r\nothers had anticipated and satirised all these stages in the Romantic\r\ndawn; they reappeared, serious and dreary, in the twilight of the dusk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Belot and others.]\r\n\r\nAdolphe Belot was not, strictly speaking, a Naturalist, for he was a\r\ndozen years older than Zola, and ran up a huge list of novels ranging in\r\ncharacter between Naturalism and melodrama. His most famous book, _Mlle.\r\nGiraud ma Femme_, was the most popular of a large number of attempts,\r\nabout the last third of the century, in the school of _La Religieuse_,\r\nbut with more or less deliberately pornographic effect. There is,\r\nhowever, some power in this book, and the \"curtain\"--the foiled husband,\r\nafter Mlle. Giraud's death, seeing his she-rival swimming, swims out\r\nafter and drowns her--is quite refreshing. But I have always liked M.\r\nBelot best for a thoughtful and delightful remark in _La Femme de Feu_.\r\n\"Heureuse elle-même, elle trouva naturel de faire les autres heureux,\"\r\nwhich, translated into plain English, means that she was so happy with\r\nher husband that she couldn't help making her lover happy. M. Belot did\r\nnot work out this modification of the Golden Rule--he was not a\r\nphilosophic novelist. But it is very humorous in itself, and the\r\nextensions and applications of it are illimitable and vertiginous.[518]\r\n\r\nBelow him it is unnecessary to go.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[455] For the early divisions of verse and prose story were all Topsies,\r\nand simply \"growed\"; although the smaller romances of the late sixteenth\r\nand early seventeenth century, and the larger of the latter date, were\r\nundoubtedly influenced by the Greek, it was more a case of general\r\nimitation than specific endeavour; the Sensibility school was very\r\nlimited and chiefly attended to tricks of manner; and the \"Romantic\r\nvague\" was never vaguer than in the vast and rather formless, though\r\nmagnificent and delightful, novel-work started by Nodier, Mérimée,\r\nVigny, and Hugo. The Naturalists, on the other hand, had a deliberate\r\nidea of revolutionising the novel--of abolishing old things and creating\r\nnew. They could not, and did not, succeed: but their scheme, as well as\r\nits results, may claim consideration.\r\n\r\n[456] To which a brief consideration of the curious fancy of some French\r\ncritics that there is something \"classical\" about Naturalism may be\r\nspecially relegated.\r\n\r\n[457] Mérimée, though after his fashion making no fuss about it, was\r\nalso an early virtuoso in this kind; and one of his letters contains an\r\nexcellent example of the quiet cynicism in which he excelled. Some\r\nladies had asked to see his collection, and he had very properly warned\r\nthem that the \"curios\" of that ingenious and valiant nation were\r\nsometimes \"curious\" in a special sense, and had offered to \"select.\"\r\n\"Elles ont tout vu,\" he adds simply, and one hopes his correspondent (I\r\nforgot whether it was one of the _Inconnues_ or Madame de Montijo)\r\nappreciated the Mount-Everest-like Laconism.\r\n\r\n[458] The banal phrase has been framed in the amber of \"Théo's\" verse,\r\nand so debanalised.\r\n\r\n[459] The first book of theirs, or rather of Edmond's, though it bore\r\nboth names, that I read, and the second French book I ever reviewed, was\r\nthe mainly artistic _Gavarni_ of 1873. One has a human weakness in such\r\ncases, but I think one might not have been wholly well disposed to the\r\nauthor from it.\r\n\r\n[460] Pepys had nothing that could be called _bad_ blood. Horace perhaps\r\nhad a little, but it was sweet and childlike compared to the\r\n\"acrid-quack\" fluid of Edmond de Goncourt's veins and heart. Probably\r\nseveral people have seen in M. de Goncourt the suggestion of an\r\n_un_-Puritan Malvolio.\r\n\r\n[461] Not, however, in the second case, by Sainte-Beuve, whose\r\nlukewarmness Edmond--a \"Sensitive Plant\" in this way if hardly in\r\nothers--never forgave.\r\n\r\n[462] She served them for a very long period without giving them any\r\napparent cause for complaint. They only found out her delinquencies\r\nafter her death, or in her last illness--I forget which. Probably\r\nnothing could better show \"the nature of the animals\" than this\r\n_post-mortem_ grubbing belowstairs for a \"subject,\" and washing your own\r\nhousehold dirty linen in public--for profit.\r\n\r\n[463] It may be well to smash, in a passing note, a silly catchword\r\npopular with some rather belated English admirers of the Naturalist\r\nschool a few years ago. They praised its \"frankness.\" You might as well\r\npraise the \"straightforwardness\" of a man who goes out of his way to\r\nexplore laystalls and, having picked up ordure, holds it up to public\r\nview.\r\n\r\n[464] Both excellent things in their way, of course. Perhaps it would be\r\nbetter to say asafoetida.\r\n\r\n[465] It is perhaps only fair to warn readers who may not know the fact,\r\nthat some very good and (in the French as well as the English sense)\r\nrespectable judges think much better of the work, and even of the men or\r\nman, than I do. _Renée Mauperin_ especially (as indeed I have admitted)\r\nhas a considerable body of suffrage; the general style pleases some, and\r\nit has been urged for Edmond that good men liked him. But these good men\r\nhad not read his diary. There is, however, no doubt that it is an\r\nexceptionally strong case of \"rubbing the [right or the] wrong way.\"\r\nBooks and men and style all rub me the wrong way; and, though I have\r\nsome knack at using the brushes and _fixatures_ of pure criticism, I\r\ncan't get myself smoothed down.\r\n\r\n[466] See note at close of chapter. One of the most comic things in the\r\nwhole Naturalist episode was the rising up of some of these disciples to\r\nrebuke their master, in a round robin, for \"right-hand and left-hand\r\ndefections\" from the pure gospel of the sect.\r\n\r\n[467] The word is used, designedly but not fraudulently, as combining\r\n\"observation\" and \"experiment\" _to the extent proper to art_. Deliberate\r\nand after-thought \"experi_ments_\" in actual life are (except in trivial\r\nmatters) very risky things; and the _Summa Rerum_ itself is apt to\r\nresent them, as, for instance, Mr. Thomas Day and Mr. Felix Graham found\r\nin the matter of wife-culture.\r\n\r\n[468] _V. sup._ Vol. I. p. 278. I was much pleased to find that the\r\nquotation considerably \"put out\" one of my few unfavourable critics.\r\n\"The Importance of Gastronomy in Novels\" is a beautiful subject--still,\r\nI think, virgin, though Thackeray has touched on it in others once or\r\ntwice, and illustrated it magnificently himself.\r\n\r\n[469] For something on the opposite view, that Naturalism is\r\n\"classical,\" see Conclusion.\r\n\r\n[470] That Flaubert escaped their error only so far as by fire has been\r\nallowed. One might indeed say so by death. For _Bouvard et Pécuchet_ as\r\nit stands, and as outlined further, is very near Naturalism. Earlier he\r\nhad carried the principle far in _Salammbô_, and would have carried it\r\nfarther if he had not listened to good advice for once. But he had fire\r\nenough in his interior to burn the rubbish and smelt the ore in his\r\nbetter books, and skill enough to run off the metal from the dross, into\r\nproper shape. The others had not.\r\n\r\n[471] I learn from the lucubrations of some Americans--who, having been,\r\nrather late and with some difficulty, induced to perceive that Edgar Poe\r\nwas their chief literary glory, have taken vehemently to his favourite\r\nkind, and written voluminously in and on it--that it ought to be called\r\na \"brief-narrative,\" the hyphen being apparently essential. This is very\r\ninteresting: and throws much light on the subject. However, having read\r\na great deal on it, I do not find myself much advanced beyond a position\r\nwhich I think I occupied some fifty years ago--to wit, that a short\r\nstory is not merely a long one cut down, nor a long story a short one\r\nspun out.\r\n\r\n[472] Barbey d'Aurevilly's (_v. sup._) attack on the book is one of the\r\nmost remarkable instances of the irresponsibility of his criticism.\r\n\r\n[473] _V. sup._ p. 258.\r\n\r\n[474] One ought perhaps to verify; but that would be hard lines to have\r\nto read _Nana_ twice!\r\n\r\n[475] That of the _Union Générale_.\r\n\r\n[476] _Vérité_, though a remarkable \"human document\" itself, and an\r\nindispensable _historical_ document for any student of the particular\r\npopular madness with which it deals, need surely be inflicted a second\r\ntime on no mortal. It is a transposition into the regions of the\r\nunmentionable, of the Dreyfus case itself. But nobody save a failure of\r\nsomething like a novelist of genius, with this failure pushed near the\r\nconfines of madness, could have written it.\r\n\r\n[477] \"M. Zola [is] apparently persuaded that, if you can only kill God,\r\nthe Devil will die--an idea which seems to leave out of consideration\r\nthe idiosyncrasy of a third personage, Man\" (_The Later Nineteenth\r\nCentury_, Edinburgh and London, 1907, pp. 93, 94).\r\n\r\n[478] Only it would have to be real Blake, not imitation, which latter\r\nis one of the furthest examples of dreary futility known to the present\r\nwriter.\r\n\r\n[479] The horticulture of _L'Abbé Mouret_ is nearest to an exception;\r\nbut even that is overdone.\r\n\r\n[480] Who might even say, \"Is not this a slip of pen or press? Has not\r\n'might' dropped out?\" I should doubt it, even if a copy of the original\r\nedition had the missing word, for it might easily have been put in by a\r\ndull but conscientious \"reader.\" The plural, in Thackeray's careless\r\nway, comes from his _thinking_ as he wrote \"Are they not _all_ ...\r\npersonage_s_....\" The context confirms this.\r\n\r\n[481] There are, of course, comparatively few of these; but the fewness\r\nis not positive, even keeping to prose-fiction. Poetry and drama--under\r\ntheir less onerous conditions for this special task--would enlarge the\r\nlist in goodly fashion.\r\n\r\n[482] Shortly after Maupassant's death, I contributed an article on him\r\nto the _Fortnightly Review_. It has never been reprinted, but, by the\r\nkindness of the Editor of that _Review_, I have been permitted to use it\r\nas a basis for this notice. I have, however, altered, omitted, and added\r\nto a much greater extent than in the few other rehandlings acknowledged\r\nin this History. The account of the actual books is wholly new.\r\n\r\n[483] I had known Verlaine since his appearance in the _Parnasse\r\nContemporain_ years earlier, but not yet in his most characteristic\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[484] The following summary, to p. 505, formed no part of the original\r\narticle and is based on fresh and continuous reading. It is purposely\r\nrather more minute than anything else in these later chapters, and was\r\nnot the easiest part of the book to do, owing to the large number of\r\nMaupassant's short stories.\r\n\r\n[485] Maupassant _could_ draw gentlemen and ladies, but he often did not\r\ndo so. His pretty young countesses (_not_ the same persons as those\r\nreferred to in text), who get drunk together _tête-à-tête_, and\r\ndiscourse on the best way of making more effectual Josephs out of their\r\nfootmen, are not pleasing, though they are right in holding that no\r\nperfume, save Eau de Cologne, doth become a _man_.\r\n\r\n[486] Vol. I. pp. 150-1.\r\n\r\n[487] The usual gutter-Naturalist certainly would--and even M. Zola, I\r\nfear, might--have done the \"Ephesian matron\" business thoroughly:\r\nMaupassant, as so often, knew other and better things.\r\n\r\n[488] It may suggest Leconte de Lisle to others and may even have been\r\nmeant for him, but I think it worthy of the earlier and greater poet.\r\n\r\n[489] It went, I fear, by mistake with the rest of my books; so I quote\r\nfrom memory. But Southey and Locker have had their duet pleasantly\r\nchanged into a trio since by Mr. Austin Dobson's _Bookman's Budget_.\r\n\r\n[490] It may be just, and only just necessary to observe (what I know\r\nperfectly well) that Maupassant was, in the direct sense, Flaubert's\r\npupil and not Zola's.\r\n\r\n[491] He was, says his historian well, \"de la race des amants et non\r\npoint de la race des pères.\"\r\n\r\n[492] The resemblances between Thackeray and Maupassant are very\r\nnumerous and most remarkable. That they have both been accused of\r\ncynicism _and_ sentimentality is only, as it were, the index-finger to\r\nthe relationship.\r\n\r\n[493] At the risk, however, of wearying the reader and \"forcing open\r\ndoors,\" one may exemplify, from this book also, the artificial character\r\nof this obligatory adultery. Anne de Guilleroy has all the\r\nqualifications of an almost perfect mistress (in the honourable sense)\r\nand wife. She is charming; a flirt to the right point and not beyond it;\r\npassionate ditto; affectionate; not capricious; inviolably faithful (in\r\nher unfaithfulness, of course); jealous to her own pain, but with no\r\nresult of malice to others. Yet in order to show all this she has to be\r\nan adulteress first--in obedience to this mysterious modernisation and\r\ntopsy-turvification of ancient Babylonian custom, and the _jus primae\r\nnoctis_, and the proverb as to second thoughts being best, and Heaven or\r\nthe other place knows what else. Here also, as elsewhere,\r\nMaupassant--satirist of women as he is--makes her lover a very inferior\r\ncreature to herself. For Bertin is a selfish coxcomb, and _does_, at\r\nleast half, allow himself to be \"snuffed out by an article.\"\r\n\r\n[494] Any one who chooses may compare it with the utterances of the late\r\nMr. Henry James. Maupassant's own selection of novels, to illustrate the\r\nimpossibility of defining _a_ novel, is of the first interest. They are:\r\n_Manon Lescaut_, _Paul et Virginie_, _Don Quichotte_, _Les Liaisons\r\nDangereuses_, _Werther_, _Les Affinités Électives_, _Clarissa_ [_he_\r\nadds _Harlowe_, an unauthentic addition, pardonable in a Frenchman,\r\nthough not in one of us], _Émile_, _Candide_, _Cinq-Mars_, _René_, _Les\r\nTrois Mousquetaires_, _Mauprat_, _Le Père Goriot_, _La Cousine Bette_,\r\n_Colomba_, _Le Rouge et Le Noir_, _Mademoiselle de Maupin_, _Notre Dame\r\nde Paris_, _Salammbô_, _Madame Bovary_, _Adolphe_, _M. de Camors_,\r\n_L'Assommoir_, and _Sapho_.\r\n\r\n[495] \"Amant\" as accurately distinguished by M. Jean Richepin in\r\n_Césarine_ (for the benefit of an innocent Hungarian) from \"amoureux.\"\r\n\r\n[496] Not that I wish to blaspheme Circe, who always seems to me to have\r\nadjusted herself to a disconcertingly changed situation with more than\r\ndemi-goddesslike dexterity and good humour. It may perhaps be not\r\nirrelevant, to discussion of novels in general, to mention something\r\nwhich I have never yet seen put in Homeric discussion, though the bare\r\nidea of anything new there being possible may seem preposterous. The\r\narguments of the splitters-up are, naturally enough, seldom if ever\r\nliterary, belonging as they do to the class of Biblical, that is to say,\r\n_un_literary, criticism. But strictly literary considerations,\r\nfurnishing argument of the strongest kind for unity, might be brought by\r\ncomparing the behaviour of Circe, at the moment referred to, and that of\r\nHelen when Paris returned from his defeat. These situations are, of\r\ncourse, in initial circumstance as opposite as possible, though they\r\n_arrivent à pareille fin_. But behind their very opposition there is a\r\nconception of the eternal feminine--partly human, partly divine--which\r\nit would be very surprising to find in two different persons, and which\r\nmight, if any one cared to do it, be interestingly worked out from\r\ndivers other Homeric characters of women or goddesses, from Hera and\r\nAphrodite in the one poem to Nausicaa and Calypso in the other. \"How\r\ngreat a _novelist_ was in _Homer_ lost\" is a theme too much neglected.\r\n\r\n[497] For do not fixed hours always become a bore--except in respect of\r\nmeals? To have to love, or to lecture, or to do anything but eat, at _x_\r\nA. or P.M. precisely, on such and such days in the week, is a weariness\r\nto the spirit and the flesh alike.\r\n\r\n[498] \"The Novelists Who Cannot End\" is one of the title-subjects which,\r\n\"reponing my senescent art,\" I relinquish to others.\r\n\r\n[499] In the card sense.\r\n\r\n[500] They run well into, if not over, the second hundred, and it is\r\nproper to warn readers (and still more buyers) that different editions\r\nvary the contents of individual volumes; so that, without some care, and\r\neven with it, duplication is nearly certain. This bad habit, not quite\r\nunknown in England, is rather common in France.\r\n\r\n[501] If any one is fortunate, or unfortunate, enough not to know this\r\nadmirable story, it may be well to say that the title is the nickname of\r\na young person, more pleasing than proper, who forms part of a convoy or\r\ncartel of non-combatants passing through the Prussian lines in 1871. The\r\nPrussian officer, imitating more mildly (and without the additional\r\nvillainy) the conduct of Colonel Kirke, refuses passage to the whole\r\nparty, unless she will give him a cast of her office. The story is told\r\nas inoffensively as possible, and the crowning irony of the shocked\r\nattitude of her respectable companions at her liberating them, though\r\nthey have been frantically anxious she should do so, is sublime.\r\n\r\n[502] Maupassant does not caricature us (at least our men) very\r\nextravagantly. But he, like the rest of them, always makes us say,\r\n\"Aoh.\" I have frequently endeavoured to produce, otherwise than as a\r\ndiphthong, this mysterious word (a descendant, perhaps, of the equally\r\nmysterious _Aoi_ of the _Chanson de Roland_?). But I cannot make it like\r\nthe way in which I say, or in which any well-educated Englishman says,\r\n\"Oh!\" American it may be, and it is not unlike the \"Ow\" of some\r\ndialects, but pure English it is not. It may be, for aught I know,\r\nphonetic: and has been explained as representing an affected sneer. The\r\ncurious thing is that \"Oh-_a_\" actually is a not unfrequent, though\r\nslovenly, pronunciation.\r\n\r\n[503] Evidently, therefore, the practice with which we have been so\r\noften reproached is of French--at least Norman--origin.\r\n\r\n[504] The _other_ one, of course, but here one must admit the\r\nsuperiority of the foreign \"strength.\" And the \"story\" has French\r\nantecedents.\r\n\r\n[505] This is an actual translation of the Norman poet's words. It makes\r\nno bad blank-verse line.\r\n\r\n[506] Its companions, in the volume to which it gives title, are mostly\r\ninferior specimens of the same class. But some, especially _Le Pain\r\nMaudit_, are very amusing, and _Lui_? is a curious and melancholy\r\nanticipation of _Le Horla_. _La Maison Tellier_, which opens and titles\r\nanother volume of no very different kind, has never seemed to me quite\r\nworthy of its fame. It is not unamusing in itself, and very amusing when\r\none thinks of its greatly-daring imitators, but rather schoolboyish or\r\neven monkeyish in its determination to shock. (It doesn't shock _me_.)\r\nAnother \"shocker,\" but tragic, not comic, _La Femme de Paul_, which\r\ncloses the book, is more powerful. (It is on the theme of _Mlle. Giraud\r\nma Femme_ (_v. inf._); only the male person, instead of drowning his\r\nshe-rival, far less wisely drowns himself.) But most of its contents\r\nsuffer, not merely from Naturalist grime, but from Naturalist\r\n_meticulousness_.\r\n\r\n[507] _V. sup._ p. 269 _sq._\r\n\r\n[508] For the \"Terror\" group see below.\r\n\r\n[509] Curiously enough, a few days _after_ writing the above I came\r\nacross, in the last _Diabolique_ of that curious flawed genius, Barbey\r\nd'Aurevilly (_v. sup._ p. 453), the words which redress, by long\r\nanticipation, the wrong done by his fellow Norman: \"Les ailes du nez,\r\n_aussi expressives que des yeux_.\"\r\n\r\n[510] In a novel by a contemporary of his, otherwise not worth notice,\r\nSir Walter Scott was accused of \"_pruderie_ bête\"; I am sure the\r\nadjective and substantive are much better mated in my text.\r\n\r\n[511] I remember, in a book which I have not seen for about two-thirds\r\nof a century, Miss Martineau's _Crofton Boys_, an agreeable anecdote\r\n(for the good Harriet, when not under the influence of Radicalism, the\r\ndismal science, Anti-Christianity, or Mr. Atkinson, could tell a story\r\nvery well) of a little English girl. It occurred to her one morning that\r\nshe should have to wash, dress, do her hair, etc., _every day for her\r\nwhole life_, and she sat down and wept bitterly. Now, if I were a little\r\nboy or girl in French novel-world, when as I remembered that I should\r\nhave, as the one, never to marry, or to commit adultery with every one\r\nwho asked me; that, as the other, I must not be left five minutes alone\r\nwith a married woman, without offering her the means of carrying out her\r\nand her husband's destiny; I really think I should imitate Miss\r\nMartineau's child, if I did not even go and hang myself. \"Fay ce que\r\nvoudras\" may be rather a wide commandment. \"Fay ce que dois\" may require\r\na little enlarging. But \"Do what you ought not, not because you wish to\r\ndo it, but because it is the proper thing to do\" is not only \"the\r\nlimit,\" but beyond it. I think that if I were a Frenchman of the\r\nnovel-type I should hate the sight of a married woman. Stone walls would\r\nnot a prison make nor iron bars a cage--so odious as this unrelieved\r\ntyranny of _concupiscentia carnis_--to order! Perhaps Wilberforce's\r\nAgathos had a tedious time of it in being always ready to resist the\r\nDragon; but how much more wearisome would it be to be always on the _qui\r\nvive_, lest you should miss a chance of _not_ resisting him!\r\n\r\n[512] The \"time\" was five and twenty years ago. But this passage,\r\ntrifling as it may seem to some readers, appeared to me worth\r\npreserving, because my recent very careful reperusal of Maupassant, as a\r\nwhole, made its appositeness constantly recur to me.\r\n\r\n[513] Nearest, perhaps, in the story called \"En Famille,\" to be found in\r\nthe _Maison Tellier_ volume.\r\n\r\n[514] Remarks already made on the particular novels and stories from\r\nthis point of view need only be referred to, not repeated. But it is\r\nfair to say that some good judges plead for \"warning off\" instead of\r\n\"inculcation.\"\r\n\r\n[515] There are some, but they are very few.\r\n\r\n[516] See Conclusion. After the above notice of Maupassant was, in its\r\nreconstituted form, entirely completed, there came into my hands a long\r\nand careful paper on the novelist's Romanticism, published by Mr. Oliver\r\nH. Moore in the Transactions of the American Modern Language Association\r\nfor March 1918. Those who are curious as to French opinion of him, and\r\nespecially as to the strange superstition of his \"classicism\" (see\r\nConclusion again), will find large extracts and references on this\r\nsubject given by Mr. Moore, who promises further discussion.\r\n\r\n[517] One never knows what is necessary or not in the way of\r\nexplanation. But perhaps it is wiser to say that I am quite aware that,\r\nbesides writing _votre_, not \"notre,\" Baudelaire had originally written\r\n\"ce long hurlement\" before the immense improvement in the text, and that\r\noriginal \"Light-houses\" were painters.\r\n\r\n[518] One slight alteration may seem almost to justify Belot's criticism\r\nof life: \"Uncomfortable herself, she thought it natural to make others\r\nuncomfortable.\" There is certainly no want of psychological observation\r\n_there_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nOTHER NOVELISTS OF 1870-1900\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The last stage.]\r\n\r\nThe remaining novelists of the Third Republic, apart from the survivors\r\nof the Second Empire and the Naturalist School, need not occupy us very\r\nlong, but must have some space. There would be no difficulty on my part\r\nin writing a volume on them, for during half the time I had to produce\r\nan article on new French books, including novels, every month,[519] and\r\nduring no small part of the rest, I did similar work on a smaller and\r\nless regular scale, reading also a great deal for my own purposes. But\r\nacknowledging, as I have elsewhere done, the difficulty of equating\r\njudgment of contemporary and non-contemporary work exactly, I think I\r\nshall hardly be doing the new writers of this time injustice if I say\r\nthat no one, except some excluded by our specifications as living, could\r\nput in any pretensions to be rated on level with the greater novelists\r\nfrom Lesage to Maupassant. There are those, of course, who would protest\r\nin favour of M. Ferdinand Fabre, and yet others would \"throw for\" M.\r\nAndré Theuriet, both of whom shall have due honour. I cannot wholly\r\nagree with them. But both of them, as well as, for very opposite\r\nreasons, MM. Ohnet and Rod, may at least require notice of some length.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ferdinand Fabre: _L'Abbé Tigrane_.]\r\n\r\n_L'Abbé Tigrane_, by Ferdinand Fabre, may be described as one of not the\r\nleast remarkable, and as certainly one of the most remarked, novels of\r\nthe later nineteenth century. It never, I think, had a very large sale;\r\nfor though at the time of its author's death, over thirty years and more\r\nafter its appearance, it had reached its sixteenth thousand, that is not\r\nmuch for a _popular_ French novel. Books of such different appeal as\r\nZola's and Feuillet's (not to mention for the present a capital example\r\nto be noted below) boasted ten times the number. But it dared an\r\nextremely non-popular subject, and treated that subject with an\r\naudacious disregard of anything like claptrap. There is no love in it\r\nand hardly a woman; there is no--at least no military--fighting; no\r\nadventure of any ordinary sort. It is neither a _berquinade_, nor a\r\ncrime-story, nor (except in a very peculiar way) a novel of analysis. It\r\nrelies on no preciousness of style, and has not very much description,\r\nthough its author was a great hand at this when and where he chose. It\r\nis simply the history of an ambitious, strong-willed, strong-minded, and\r\nviolent-tempered priest in an out-of-the-way diocese, who strives for\r\nand attains the episcopate, and after it the archiepiscopate, and is\r\nleft aspiring to the Papacy--which, considering the characters of the\r\nactual successors of Pius IX., the Abbé Capdepont[520] cannot have\r\nreached, in the fifty years (or nearly so) since the book was published.\r\n\r\nNow, in the first place, it is generations since a clerical novel was\r\nlikely to please the French novel-reading public. In this very book\r\nthere is an amusing scene where the _abbé_, then a private tutor,\r\ninduces his employer, a deputy, to invite clerics of distinction to a\r\nparty, whereat the other guests melt away in disgust. And this was a\r\nlong time before a certain French minister boasted that his countrymen\r\n\"had taken God out of Heaven.\" Moreover, while there are two obvious\r\nways of reconciling extremists to the subject, M. Fabre rejected both.\r\nHis book is neither a panegyric on clericalism nor a libel on it. His\r\nhero is as far as possible from being a saint, but he is perfectly free\r\nfrom all the vulgar vices. The rest of the characters--all, with\r\ninsignificant exceptions, clerics--are quite human, and in no case--not\r\neven in that of Capdepont's not too scrupulous aide-de-camp the Abbé\r\nMical--offensive. But at the beginning the bishop, between whom and the\r\nhero there is truceless war, is, though privately an amiable and\r\ncharitable gentleman (Capdepont is a Pyrenean peasant by origin), rather\r\nundignified, and even a little tyrannical; while a cardinal towards the\r\nend makes a distinction--between the impossibility of the Church lying\r\nand the positive duty of Churchmen, in certain circumstances, to\r\nlie--which would have been a godsend to Kingsley in that unequal\r\nconflict of his with a colleague of his Eminence's.[521]\r\n\r\nYet critics of almost all shades agreed, I think, in recognising the\r\nmerits of M. Fabre's book; and it established him in a special position\r\namong French novelists, which he sustained not unworthily with nearly a\r\nscore of novels in a score and a half of years. It is undoubtedly a book\r\nof no small power, which is by no means confined to the petty matters of\r\nchapter-and-seminary wrangling and intrigue. On the contrary, the scene\r\nwhere, owing to Capdepont's spite, the bishop's coffin is kept, in a\r\nfrightful storm, waiting for admission to its inmate's own cathedral, is\r\na very fine thing indeed--almost, if not quite, in the grand\r\nstyle--according to some, if not according to Mr. Arnold. The figure of\r\nthe arch-priest Clamousse, both in connection with this scene[522] and\r\nothers--old, timid, self-indulgent, but not an absolutely bad fellow--is\r\nof first-rate subordinate quality. Whether Capdepont himself has not a\r\nlittle too much of that synthetic character which I have discussed\r\nelsewhere--whether he is quite a real man, and not something of a\r\ncomposition of the bad qualities of the peasant type, the intriguing\r\necclesiastic type, the ambitious man, the angry man, and so on--must, I\r\nsuppose, be left to individual tastes and judgments. If I am not so\r\nenthusiastic about the book as some have been, it is perhaps because it\r\nseems to me rather a study than a story.[523]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Norine_, etc.]\r\n\r\nThis criticism--it is not intended for a reproach--does not extend to\r\nother, perhaps not so powerful, but more _pastimeous_ books, though M.\r\nFabre seldom entirely excluded the clerical atmosphere of his\r\nyouth.[524] A very pleasant volume-full is _Norine_, the title-piece of\r\nwhich is full at once of Cevenol scenery and Parisian contrast, of love,\r\nand, at least, preparations for feasting; of sketches of that\r\n\"Institute\" life which comes nearest to our collegiate one; and of\r\npleasant bird-worship. But M. Fabre should have told us whether the\r\nbishop actually received and appreciated[525] the dinner of Truscas\r\ntrout and Faugères wine (alas! this is a blank in my fairly extensive\r\nwine-list), and the miscellaneous _maigre_ cookery of the excellent\r\nPrudence, and the splendid casket of _liqueurs_ borrowed from a brother\r\n_curé_. _Cathinelle_ (an unusual and pretty diminutive of Catherine) is\r\nan admirably told pendant to it; and I venture to think the \"idyllic\"\r\nquality of both at least equal, if not superior, to the best of George\r\nSand. _Le R. P. Colomban_ is, according to M. Fabre's habit, a sort of\r\ndouble-edged affair--a severe but just rebuke of the \"popular\r\npreacher,\" and a good-humoured touch at the rebuker, Monseigneur Onésime\r\nde la Boissière, Evêque de Saint-Pons, who incidentally proposes to\r\nsubmit _L'Abbé Tigrane_ to the Holy Congregation of the Index. Finally,\r\nthe book closes with a delightful panegyric of Alexandre Dumas _père_,\r\nand an anecdote avowedly autobiographic (as, indeed, the whole book\r\ngives itself out to be, though receivable with divers pinches of salt)\r\nof that best-natured of men franking a bevy of impecunious students at a\r\n_première_ of one of his plays.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Marquis de Pierrerue._]\r\n\r\nTo read _Le Marquis de Pierrerue_ after these two books--one the piece\r\nwith which Fabre established his reputation, and the other a product of\r\nhis proved mastery--is interesting to the critic. Whether it would be so\r\nto the general reader may be more doubtful. It is the longest of its\r\nauthor's novels; in fact its two volumes have separate sub-titles;[526]\r\nbut there is no real break, either of time, place, or action, between\r\nthem. It is a queer book, quite evidently of the novitiate, and\r\nsuggesting now Paul de Kock (the properer but not _quite_ proper Paul),\r\nnow Daudet (to whom it is actually dedicated), now Feuillet, now Murger,\r\nnow Sandeau, now one of the melodramatic story-tellers. Very possibly\r\nall these had a share in its inspiration. It is redolent of the medical\r\nstudies which the author actually pursued, between his abandonment of\r\npreparation for the Church and his settling down as a man of letters.\r\nIts art is palpably imperfect--blocks of _récit_, wedges of not very\r\nnovel or acute reflection, a continual reluctance or inability to \"get\r\nforrard.\" Of the two heroes, Claude Abrial, Marquis de Pierrerue--a\r\nfervent Royalist and Catholic, who lavishes his own money, and everybody\r\nelse's that he can get hold of, on a sort of private Literary Fund,[527]\r\nallows himself to be swindled by a scoundrelly man of business, immures\r\nhis daughter, against her wish, as a Carmelite nun, and dies a\r\npauper--is a quite possible but not quite \"brought off\" figure. Théven\r\nFalgouët, the Breton _buveur d'eau_,[528] who is introduced to us at\r\nactual point of starvation, and who dies, self-transfixed on the sharp\r\nspikes of the Carmelite _grille_, is perhaps not _im_possible, and\r\noccasionally pathetic. But the author seems, in his immaturity as a\r\ncraftsman, never to have made up his mind whether he is producing an\r\n\"alienist\" study, or giving us a fairly ordinary _étudiant_ and aspirant\r\nin letters. Of the two heroines, the noble damsel Claire de\r\nPierrerue--object of Falgouët's love at first sight, a love ill-fated\r\nand more insane than even love beseems--is quite nice in her way; and\r\nRose Keller--last of grisettes, but a grisette of the Upper House, an\r\nartist grisette, and, as some one calls her, the \"soeur de charité de\r\nla galanterie\"[529]--is quite nice in hers. But Rose's action--in\r\nburning, to the extent of several hundred thousand francs' worth, notes\r\nand bonds, the wicked gains of one of her lovers (Grippon, the Marquis's\r\nfraudulent intendant), and promptly expiring--may pair off with\r\nFalgouët's repeating on himself the Spanish torture-death of the\r\n_guanches_,[530] as pure melodrama. In fact the whole thing is\r\nundigested, and shows, in a high degree, that initial difficulty in\r\ngetting on with the story which has not quite disappeared in _L'Abbé\r\nTigrane_, but which has been completely conquered[531] in _Norine_ and\r\n_Cathinelle_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mon Oncle Célestin._]\r\n\r\nThis mixed quality makes itself felt in others of Fabre's books. Perhaps\r\nthere is none of them, except _L'Abbé Tigrane_ itself, which has been a\r\ngreater favourite with his partisans than _Mon Oncle Célestin_. Here we\r\nhave something of the same easy autobiographic quality, with the same\r\ngeneral scene and the same relations of the narrator and the principal\r\ncharacters, as in other books; but \"Mr. the nephew\" (the agreeable and\r\ncontinuous title by which the faithful parishioners address their\r\nbeloved pastor's boy relative) has a different uncle and a different\r\n_gouvernante_, at least in name, from those in _Norine_ and\r\n_Cathinelle_. The Abbé Célestin, threatened with consumption, exchanges\r\nthe living in which he has worked for many years, and little good comes\r\nof it. He is persecuted, actually to the death, by his rural dean, a\r\nsort of duplicate of the hero of _L'Abbé Tigrane_; but the circumstances\r\nare not purely ecclesiastical. He has, in his new parish, taken for\r\ngoat-girl a certain Marie Galtier, daughter of his beadle, but,\r\nunluckily, also step-daughter of a most abominable step-mother. Marie,\r\nas innocently as possible, \"gets into trouble,\" and dies of it,\r\naccusations being brought against her guiltless and guileless master in\r\nconsequence. There are many good passages; the opening is (as nearly\r\nalways with M. Fabre) excellent; but both the parts and the whole are,\r\nonce more, too long--the mere \"flitting\" from one parish to another\r\nseems never to be coming to an end. Still, the book should be read; and\r\nit has one very curious class of personages, the \"hermits\" of the\r\nCevennes--probably the latest (the date is 1846) of their kind in\r\nliterature. The general characteristics of that kind do not seem to have\r\nbeen exactly saintly;[532] and the best of them, Adon Laborie, after\r\nbeing \"good\" throughout, and always intending to be so, brings about the\r\ncatastrophe by calmly suppressing, in the notion that he will save the\r\nAbbé trouble, three successive citations from the Diocesan Council,\r\nthereby getting him \"interdicted.\" The shock, when the judgment in\r\ncontumacy is announced by the brutal dean, proves fatal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Lucifer._]\r\n\r\nIn Lucifer M. Fabre is still nearer, though with no repetition, to the\r\n_Tigrane_ motive. The book justifies its title by being the most\r\nambitious of all the novels, and justifies the ambition itself by\r\nshowing a great deal of power--most perhaps again, of all; though\r\nwhether that power is used to the satisfaction of the reader must\r\ndepend, even more than is usual, on individual tastes. Bernard Jourfier,\r\nat the beginning of the book and of the Second Empire, is a young\r\n_vicaire_, known to be of great talents and, in especial, of unusual\r\npreaching faculty, but of a violent temper, ill at ease about his own\r\nvocation, and suspected--at least by Ultramontanes--of very doubtful\r\northodoxy and not at all doubtful Gallicanism. He is, moreover, the\r\ngrandson of a _conventionnel_ who voted for the King's death, and the\r\nson of a deputy of extreme Liberal views. So the Jesuits, after trying\r\nto catch him for themselves, make a dead set at him, and secure his\r\nappointment to out-of-the-way country parishes only, and even in these\r\nhis constant removal, so that he may acquire as little influence as\r\npossible anywhere. At last, in a very striking interview with his\r\nbishop, he succeeds in clearing his character, and enters on the way of\r\npromotion. The cabals continue; but later, on the overthrow of\r\nBonapartism, he is actually raised to the episcopate. His violent\r\ntemper, however, is always giving handles to the enemy, and he finally\r\ndetermines that life is intolerable. After trying to starve himself, he\r\nmakes use of the picturesque but dangerous situation of his palace, and\r\nis crushed by falling, in apparent accident, through a breach in the\r\ngarden wall with a precipice beneath--\"falling like Lucifer,\" as his\r\nlifelong enemy and rival whispers to a confederate at the end. For the\r\nappellation has been an Ultramontane nickname for him long before, and\r\nhas been not altogether undeserved by his pride at least. It has been\r\nsaid that the book is powerful; but it is almost unrelievedly gloomy\r\nthroughout, and suffers from the extremely narrow range of its interest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sylviane_ and _Taillevent_.]\r\n\r\nThose who are not tired of the Cevenol atmosphere--which, it must be\r\nadmitted, is quite a refreshing one--will find a lighter example in\r\n_Sylviane_, once more recounted by \"Mr. the nephew,\" but with his\r\nmovable uncle and _gouvernante_ shifted back to \"M. Fulcran\" and\r\n\"Prudence\"; and in _Taillevent_, a much longer book, which is\r\nindependent of uncle and nephew both. _Sylviane_ has agreeable things in\r\nit, but perhaps might have been better if its form had been different.\r\nIt is a long _récit_ told by a gamekeeper, with frequent\r\ninterruptions[533] and a very thin \"frame.\" _Taillevent_ ends with two\r\nmurders, the second a quite excusable lynch-punishment for the first,\r\nand the marriage of the avenger just afterwards to the daughter of the\r\noriginal victim, a combination of \"the murders _and_ the marriages\"\r\ndeserving Osric's encomia on sword furniture. So vigorous a conclusion\r\nhad need have a well-stuffed course of narrative to lead up to it, and\r\nthis is not wanting. There is a wicked--a _very_ wicked--Spaniard for\r\nthe lynched-murderer part; an exceedingly good dog-, bear-, and\r\nman-fight in the middle; an extensive and well-utilised wolf-trap in the\r\nwoods; bankruptcies; floods; all sorts of things; with a course of\r\n\"idyllic\" true love running through the whole. There _is_ a _curé_--a\r\nrather foolish one; but the ecclesiastical interest in itself is almost\r\nabsent from the book. The weakest part of it lies in the characters of\r\nwhat may be called the hero and heroine of the beginning and\r\nmiddle--Frédéric Servières and Madeleine his wife. That the former\r\nshould fall into the most frantic love before marriage, and almost\r\nneglect his wife as soon as she has borne him a child, may be said to be\r\ncommon enough in books, and, unluckily, by no means uncommon in life.\r\nBut there may be more question about the repetition of the inconsistency\r\nin other parts of the character--extreme business aptitude and fatal\r\nneglect of business, extreme energy and fatal depression over quite\r\nsmall things, etc. The general combination is not impossible; it is not\r\neven improbable; but it is not quite \"made so.\" And something is the\r\nsame with Madeleine, who is, moreover, left \"in the air\" in so curious a\r\nfashion that one begins to wonder whether the Mrs. Martha Buskbody\r\nattitude, so often jibed at, does not possess some excuse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Toussaint Galabru._]\r\n\r\nA pleasant contrast in this respect, though the end here is tragic in a\r\nway, may be found in _Toussaint Galabru_, the last, perhaps, of M.\r\nFabre's books for which we can find special room here, though no doubt\r\nsome favourites of particular readers may have been omitted. The novel\r\nis divided into two pretty equal halves, with an interval first of ten\r\nyears between them and, almost immediately, of sixteen more. The first\r\nhalf is occupied by an adventure of \"Mr. the nephew's,\" though he is not\r\nhere \"Mr. the nephew,\" but \"Mr. the son,\" living with his father and\r\nmother at Bédarieux, M. Fabre's actual birthplace. He plays truant from\r\nChurch on Advent Sunday to join a shooting expedition with his\r\nschool-fellow Baptistin and that school-fellow's not too pious father,\r\nwho is actually a church _suisse_, but has received an exeat from the\r\n_curé_ to catch a famous hare for that _curé_ to eat. The vicissitudes\r\nof the chase are numerous, and the whole is narrated with extraordinary\r\nskill as from the boy's point of view, his entire innocence, when he is\r\nbrought into contact with very shady incidents, being--and this is a\r\nmost difficult thing to do--hit off marvellously well. It is only\r\ntowards the end of this part (he has been heard of before) that\r\nToussaint Galabru, sorcerer and Lothario, makes his appearance--as\r\nclever as he is handsome, and as vicious as he is clever. When he does\r\nappear he has his way--with the game shot by others, and with a certain\r\n_métayer's_ wife--after the same hand-gallop fashion in which the\r\npersonage in Blake's lines enjoyed both the peach and the lady.\r\n\r\nThe earlier and shorter, but not short, interval, mentioned above,\r\npasses to 1852, and does little more than bring the now \"Parisian\"\r\nnarrator into fresh contact with his old school-fellow Baptistin, now a\r\nfull-grown priest, but, though very pious, in some difficulties from his\r\npersistent love of sport. Sixteen years later, again, in 1868,\r\nreappears, \"coming to his death,\"[534] Galabru himself. The part is\r\nchiefly occupied by a _récit_ of intervening history (including a sadly\r\nunsuccessful attempt, both at spiritual and physical combat, by\r\nBaptistin) and by a much-interrupted journey in snow.[535] But it gives\r\noccasion for another agreeable \"idyll\" between Vincinet, Galabru's son,\r\nand the Abbé Baptistin's god-child Lalie; and it ends with a striking\r\nprocession to carry, hardly in time, the _viaticum_ to the dying wizard,\r\nwhereby, if not his own weal in the other world, that of the lovers in\r\nthis is happily brought about.\r\n\r\nNot very many generalities are required on M. Ferdinand Fabre. How\r\ncompletely his way lies out of most of the ruts in which the wain of the\r\nFrench novel usually travels must have been shown; and it may be hoped\r\nthat enough has been said also to show that there are plenty of minor\r\noriginalities about him. No novelist[536] in any language known to me\r\n(unless you call Richard Jefferies a novelist) has such an extraordinary\r\ncommand of \"the country\"--bird-nature and rock scenery being his\r\nfavourite but by no means his only subjects. For \"Scenes of Clerical\r\nLife\" he stands admittedly alone in France, and has naturally been dealt\r\nwith most often from this point of view. Of that intense provincialism,\r\nin the good sense, which is characteristic of French literature, there\r\nhave been few better representatives. Wordsworth himself is scarcely\r\nmore the poet of our Lake and Hill country than Fabre is the novelist of\r\nthe Cevennes. Peasant life and child life of the country (he meddles\r\nlittle, and not so happily, with towns of any size) find in him\r\nadmirably \"vatical\" properties and combinations; and if he does not run\r\nany risk of Feste's rebuke by talking much of \"ladies,\" he knows as much\r\nabout women as a man well may. His comedy is never coarse or trivial,\r\nand the tragedy never goes off through the touch-hole. Of one\r\nsituation--very easy to spoil by rendering it mawkish--the early but not\r\n\"calf\"-love of rustic man and maid, beginning in childhood, he was\r\ncuriously master. George Sand herself[537] has nothing to beat (if she\r\nhas anything to equal) the pairs of Taillevent and Riquette (in the\r\nnovel named from the lover), and of Vincinet and Lalie (in _Toussaint\r\nGalabru_). As for his pictures of clerical cabals and clerical\r\nweaknesses, they may be too much of a good thing for some tastes; but\r\nthat they are a good thing, both as an exercise in craftsmanship and as\r\nan alternative to the common run of French novel subjects, can hardly be\r\ndenied. In this respect, and not in this respect only, M. Fabre has his\r\nown place, and that no low one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: André Theuriet.]\r\n\r\nIn coming to M. André Theuriet I felt a mixture of curiosity with a\r\nslight uneasiness. For I had read not a few of his books[538] carefully\r\nand critically at their first appearance, and in such cases--when novels\r\nare not of the _very_ first order (which, good as these are, I think few\r\nreally critical readers would allot them) nor possessed of those\r\n\"oddments\" of appeal which sometimes make more or less inferior books\r\nreadable and readable again--fresh acquaintance, after a long time, is\r\ndangerous. It has been said here (possibly more than once) that, when a\r\nbook possesses this peculiar readableness, a second reading is\r\npositively beneficial to it, because you neglect the \"knots in the reed\"\r\nand slip along it easily. This is not quite the case with others: and,\r\nunless great critical care is taken, a new acquaintance, itself thirty\r\nyears old, has, I fear, a better chance than an old one renewed after\r\nthat time. However, the knight of Criticism, as of other ladies,[539]\r\nmust dare any adventure, and ought to be able to bring the proper arms\r\nand methods to the task. For the purposes of renewal I chose\r\n_Sauvageonne_, _Le Fils Maugars_, and _Raymonde_. With the first, though\r\nI did not remember much more than its central situation and its\r\ncatastrophe, with one striking incident, I do remember being originally\r\npleased; the second has, I believe, at least sometimes, been thought\r\nTheuriet's masterpiece; and the third (which, by the way, is a\r\n\"philippine\" containing another story besides the title-one) is an early\r\nbook which I had not previously read.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sauvageonne._]\r\n\r\nThe argument of _Sauvageonne_ can be put very shortly. A young man of\r\nfour-and-twenty, of no fortune, marries a rich widow ten years older\r\nthan himself, and, as it happens, possessed of an adopted daughter of\r\nseventeen. He--who is by no means an intentional scoundrel, but a\r\ncommonplace and selfish person, and a gentleman neither by birth nor by\r\nnature--soon wearies of his somewhat effusive and exacting wife; the\r\ngirl takes a violent fancy to him; accident hurries on the natural if\r\nnot laudable consequences; the wife covers the shame by succeeding in\r\npassing off their result as her own child, but the strain is too much\r\nfor her, and she goes mad, but does not die.\r\n\r\nThis tragic theme (really a tragic [Greek: hamartia], for there is much\r\ngood in Sauvageonne, as she is called, from her tomboy habits, and, with\r\nhappier chance and a nobler lover, all might have been well with her) is\r\nhandled with no little power, and with abundant display of skill in two\r\ndifferent departments which M. Theuriet made particularly his\r\nown--sketches of the society of small country towns, and elaborate\r\ndescription of the country itself, especially wood-scenery. In regard to\r\nthe former, it must be admitted that, though there is plenty of scandal\r\nand not a little ill-nature in English society of the same kind, the\r\nlatter nuisance seems, according to French novelists, to be more\r\n_active_ with their country folk than it is with ours[540]--a thing, in\r\na way, convenient for fiction. Of the descriptive part the only\r\nunfavourable criticism (and that a rather ungracious one) that could be\r\nmade is that it is almost too elaborate. Of two fateful scenes of\r\n_Sauvageonne_, that where Francis Pommeret, the unheroic hero, comes\r\nacross Denise (the girl's proper name) sitting in a crab-tree in the\r\nforest and pelting small boys with the fruit, is almost startlingly\r\nvivid. You see every detail of it as if it were on the Academy walls. In\r\nfact, it is almost more like a picture than like reality, which is more\r\nshaded off and less sharp in outline and vivid in colour. As for the\r\ncharacter-drawing, if it does not attain to that consummateness which\r\nhas been elsewhere described and desiderated--the production of people\r\nthat you _know_--it attains the second rank; the three prominent\r\ncharacters (the rest are merely sets-off) are all people that you\r\n_might_ know. Denise herself is very near the first rank, and Francis\r\nPommeret--not, as has been said, by any means a scoundrel, for he only\r\nsuccumbs to strong and continued temptation, but an ordinary selfish\r\ncreature--is nearer than those who wish to think nobly of human nature\r\nmay like, to complete reality. One is less certain about the unhappy\r\nAdrienne Lebreton or Pommeret, but discussion of her would be rather \"an\r\nintricate impeach.\" And one may have a question about the end. We are\r\ntold that Francis and Denise keep together (the luckless wife living on\r\nin spite of her madness) because of the child, though they absolutely\r\nhate each other. Would it not be more natural that, if they do not part,\r\nthey should vary the hatred with spasms of passion and repulsion?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Fils Maugars._]\r\n\r\n_Le Fils Maugars_ is not only a longer book, but its space is less\r\nexclusively filled with a single situation, and the necessary prelude to\r\nit. In fact, the whole thing is expanded, varied, and peopled. Auberive,\r\nnear Langres, the place of _Sauvageonne_, is hardly more than a large\r\nvillage; Saint-Clémentin, on the Charente, though not a large town, is\r\nthe seat of a judicial Presidency, of a _sous-préfecture_, etc. \"Le\r\n_père_ Maugars\" is a banker who, from having been a working stone-mason,\r\nhas enriched himself by sharp practice in money-lending. His son is a\r\nlawyer by the profession chosen for him, and a painter by preference.\r\nThe heroine, Thérèse Desroches, is the daughter of a Republican doctor,\r\nwhose wife has been unfaithful, and who suspects Thérèse of not being\r\nhis own child. The scene shifts from Saint-Clémentin itself to the\r\ncountry districts where Poitou and Touraine meet, as well as to Paris.\r\nThe time begins on the eve of the Coup d'État, and allows itself a gap\r\nof five years between the first and second halves of the book. Besides\r\nthe love-scenes and the country descriptions and the country feasts\r\nthere is a little general society; much business; some politics,\r\nincluding the attempted and at last accomplished arrest of the doctor\r\nfor treason to the new _régime_; a well-told account of a contest for\r\nthe Prix de Rome; a trial of the elder Maugars for conspiracy (with a\r\nsubordinate usurer) to defraud, etc. The whole begins with more than a\r\nlittle aversion on everybody's part for the innocent Étienne Maugars,\r\nwho, having been away from home for years, knows neither the fact nor\r\nthe cause of his father's unpopularity; and it ends with condign\r\npoetical justice, on the extortioner in the form of punishment, and for\r\nthe lovers in another way. It is thus, though a less poignant book than\r\n_Sauvageonne_, a fuller and wider one, and it displays, better than that\r\nbook, the competence and adequacy which mark the author, though there\r\nmay be something else to be said about it (or rather about its\r\nillustration of his general characteristics) presently.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Don Juan de Vireloup_ and _Raymonde_.]\r\n\r\n_Le Don Juan de Vireloup_, a story of about a hundred pages long, which\r\nacts as makeweight to _Raymonde_, itself only about twice the length, is\r\na capital example of Theuriet at nearly his best--a pleasant mixture of\r\n_berquinade_ and _gaillardise_ (there are at least two passages at\r\neither of which Mrs. Grundy would require _sal volatile_, and would then\r\nput the book in the fire). The reformation and salvation of Jean de\r\nSantenoge--a poor (indeed penniless) gentleman, who lives in a little\r\nold manor, or rather farm-house, buried in the woods, and whose sole\r\noccupations are poaching and making love to peasant girls--are most\r\nagreeably conducted by the agency of the daughter of a curmudgeonly\r\nforest-inspector (who naturally regards Santenoge with special\r\nabhorrence). She is helped by her grand-uncle, a doctor of the familiar\r\nstamp, who has known Diderot's child, Madame de Vandeul (the scene, as\r\nin so many of the author's books, is close to Langres), and worships\r\nDenis himself. As for _Raymonde_, its heroine comes closer to\r\n\"Sauvageonne,\" though she is less of a savagess: and the worst that can\r\nbe said against her lucky winner is that he is a little of a prig. But,\r\nto borrow, and very slightly alter, one of Sir Walter's pieces of divine\r\ncharity, \"The man is mortal, and a scientific person.\" Perhaps fate and\r\nM. Theuriet are a little too harsh to another (but not this time\r\nbeggarly) _gentillâtre_, Osmin de Préfontaine, to whom, one regrets to\r\nsay, Raymonde positively, or almost positively, engages herself, before\r\nshe in the same way virtually accepts the physiological Antoine Verdier.\r\nAnd the _dénouement_, where everything comes right, is a little\r\nstagy.[541] But the whole is thoroughly readable, competently\r\ncharactered, and illustrated by some of the best of the author's forest\r\ndescriptions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General characteristics.]\r\n\r\nOne has thus been able to give an account, very favourable in the main,\r\nof these three or four stories--selected with no hidden design, and in\r\ntwo cases previously unknown to the critic, who has, in addition, a fair\r\nremembrance of several others. But it will be observed that there is in\r\nthem, with all their merits, some evidence of that \"rut\" or \"mould\"\r\ncharacter which has been specified as absent in greater novelists, but\r\nas often found in company with a certain accomplishment, in _ordonnance_\r\nand readable quality, that marks the later novel. The very great\r\nprominence of description is common to all of them, and in three out of\r\nthe four the scenes are from the same district--almost from the same\r\npatch--of country. The heroine is the most prominent character and, as\r\nshe should be, the most attractive figure of all; but she is made up and\r\npresented, if not exactly _à la douzaine_, yet with a strong, almost a\r\nsisterly, family likeness. Far be it from the present writer to regret\r\nor desiderate the adorably candid creature who so soon smirches her\r\nwhiteness. Even the luckless Sauvageonne--worst mannered, worst\r\nmoralled, and worst fated of all--is a jewel and a cynosure compared\r\nwith that other class of girl; while Raymonde (whose maltreatment of M.\r\nde Préfontaine is to a great extent excused by her mother's bullying,\r\nher real father's weakness, and her own impulsive temperament); the\r\nThérèse of _Le Fils Maugars_; and the Marianne of _Le Don Juan de\r\nVireloup_ are, in ascending degrees, girls of quite a right kind. Only,\r\nit is just a little too much the _same_ kind. And without unfairness,\r\nwithout even ingratitude, one may say that this sameness does somewhat\r\ncharacterise M. Theuriet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Georges Ohnet.]\r\n\r\nThere were some who did not share the general admiration, a good many\r\nyears ago, of the dictum of a popular French critic on a more popular\r\nFrench novelist to the effect that, though it was his habit, in the\r\narticles he was writing, to confine himself to literature, he would\r\nbreak this good custom for once and discuss M. Ohnet. In the first\r\nplace, this appeared to the dissidents a very easy kind of witticism;\r\nthey knew many men, many women, and many schoolboys who could have\r\nuttered it. In the second, they were probably of the opinion (changing\r\nthe matter, instead of, like that wicked Prince Seithenyn, merely\r\nreversing the order, of the old Welsh saying) that \"The goodness of wit\r\nsleeps in the badness of manners.\" But if the question had been then, or\r\nwere now, asked seriously whether the literary value of _Le Maître de\r\nForges_ and its companion novels was high, few of them would, as\r\nprobably, have been or be able to answer in the affirmative. For my own\r\npart, I always used to think, when M. Ohnet's novels came out, that they\r\nwere remarkably like those of the eminent Mrs. Henry Wood[542] in\r\nEnglish--of course _mutatis mutandis_. They displayed very fair aptitude\r\nfor the _business_ of novel manufacture, and the results were such as,\r\nin almost every way, to satisfy the average subscriber to a circulating\r\nlibrary, supposing him or her to possess respectable tastes (scarcely\r\n\"taste\"), moderate intelligence, and a desire to pass the time\r\ncomfortably enough in reading them once, without the slightest\r\nexpectation of being, or wish to be, able to read them again. They might\r\neven sometimes excite readers who possessed an adjustable \"tally\" of\r\nexcitableness. But beyond this, as it seemed to their critic of those\r\ndays, they never went.\r\n\r\nRe-reading, therefore--though perhaps the consequence may not seem\r\ndownright to laymen--promised some critical interest. I first selected\r\nfor the purpose, to give the author as good a chance as possible, _Serge\r\nPanine_, which the Academy crowned, and which went near its hundred and\r\nfifty editions when it was still a four-year-old; and _Le Maître de\r\nForges_ itself, the most popular of all, adding _Le Docteur Rameau_ and\r\n_La Grande Marnière_, which my memory gave me as having seemed to be of\r\nsuch pillars as the particular structure could boast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Serge Panine._]\r\n\r\nI suppose the Forty crowned _Serge Panine_ because it was a virtuous\r\nbook, and an attack on the financial trickeries which, about the time\r\nand a little later, enriched the French language with the word \"krach.\"\r\nOtherwise, though no one could call it bad, its royalty could hardly\r\nseem much other than that which qualifies for the kingdom of the blind.\r\nThe situations are good, and they are worked up into a Fifth Act, as we\r\nmay call it (it occupies almost exactly a fifth of the book, which was,\r\nof course, dramatised), _melo_dramatic to the _n_th, ending in a\r\ndiscovery of flagrant delict, or something very like it, and in the\r\nshooting of a son-in-law by his mother-in-law to save the downfall of\r\nhis reputation. But the characters do not play up to their parts, or\r\neach other, very well, with the possible or passable exception of the\r\nmother-in-law, and of one very minor personage, the secretary Maréchal,\r\nwhom M. Ohnet, perhaps distrustful of his power to make him more, left\r\nminor. The hero is a Polish prince, with everything that a stage Polish\r\nprince requires about him--handsome, superficially amiable, what the\r\nprecise call \"caressing\" and the vulgar \"carneying\" in manner, but\r\nextravagant, quite non-moral, and not possessed of much common sense.\r\nHis princess Micheline is a silly jilt before marriage and a sillier\r\n\"door-mat\" (as some women call others) of a wife. Her rival, and in a\r\nfashion foster-sister (she has been adopted before Micheline's birth),\r\ndoes things which many people might do, but does not do them in a\r\nconcatenation accordingly. The jilted serious young man Pierre accepts a\r\nperfectly impossible position in reference to his former _fiancée_ and\r\nhis supplanter, and gives more proofs of its impossibility by his\r\nconduct and speech than was at all necessary. The conversation is very\r\nflat, and the descriptions are chiefly confined to long, gaudy\r\ninventories of rich parvenus' houses, which read like auctioneers'\r\ncatalogues.\r\n\r\nBut the worst part of the book, and probably that which at its\r\nappearance exasperated the critics, though it did not disturb the\r\n_abonné_--or, more surprisingly, the Immortals--is the flatness of style\r\nwhich has been already noted in the conversation, but which overflows\r\ninsupportably into the narrative. M. Ohnet speaks somewhere, justly\r\nenough, of \"le style à la fois prétentieux et plat, familier aux\r\nreporters.\" But was he trying--there is no sign of it--to parody these\r\nunfortunate persons when he himself described dinner-rolls as \"Ces\r\nboules dorées qui sollicitent l'appétit le plus rebelle, et accommodées\r\ndans une serviette damassée artistement pliée, parent si élégamment un\r\ncouvert\"? Or when he tells us that at a ball \"Les femmes, leurs\r\nsplendides toilettes gracieusement étalées sur les meubles bas et\r\nmoëlleux, causaient chiffons sous l'éventail, ou écoutaient les\r\ncantilènes d'un chanteur exotique pendant que les jeunes gens leur\r\nchuchotaient des galanteries à l'oreille.\" This last is really worthy of\r\nthe feeblest member of our \"_plated_ silver fork school\" between the\r\ntime of Scott and Miss Austen and that of Dickens and Thackeray.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Maître de Forges._]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1902, _Le Maître de Forges_, which was then just twenty\r\nyears old, had reached its three hundred and sixty-seventh edition. Six\r\nyears later Fromentin's _Dominique_, which was then forty-five years\r\nold, had reached its twenty-seventh. The accident of the two books lying\r\nside by side on my table has enabled me to make this comparison, the\r\nmoral of which will be sufficiently drawn by a reference to what has\r\nbeen said of _Dominique_ above,[543] and by the few remarks on M.\r\nOhnet's most popular book which follow.\r\n\r\nOne old receipt for popularity, \"Put your characters up several steps in\r\nsociety,\" M. Ohnet has faithfully obeyed. We begin with a marquis\r\nunintentionally poaching on the ironmaster's ground, and (rather oddly)\r\naccepting game which he has _not_ shot thereon. We end with the\r\nmarquis's sister putting her dainty fingers before the mouth of a duke's\r\nexploding pistol--to the not surprising damage of those digits, but with\r\nthe result of happiness ever afterwards for the respectable characters\r\nof the book. There is a great deal of gambling, though, unfortunately\r\ntold in a rather uninteresting manner of _récit_, which is a pity, for\r\ngambling can be made excellent in fiction.[544] There are several of M.\r\nOhnet's favourite inventories, and a baroness--not a bad baroness--who\r\nhas frequented sales, and knows all about _bric-à-brac_. Also there are\r\nseveral exciting situations, even before we come to the application of a\r\nlady's fingers as tompions. M. Ohnet is, it has been said, rather good\r\nat situations. But situations, to speak frankly, are rather things for\r\nthe stage than for the story, except very rarely, and of a very\r\nstriking--which does not mean melodramatic--kind. And it is very\r\nimportant, off the stage, that they should be led up to, and acted in\r\nby, vigorously drawn and well filled in characters.\r\n\r\nTo do M. Ohnet justice, he has attempted to meet this requirement in one\r\ninstance at least, the one instance by which the book has to stand or\r\nfall. Some of the minor personages (like Maréchal in _Serge Panine_) are\r\nfair enough; and the little baroness who, arriving at a country-house in\r\na whirl of travel and baggage, cries, \"Où est mon mari? Est-ce que j'ai\r\n_déjà_ égaré mon mari?\" puts one, for the moment, in quite a good\r\ntemper. The ironmaster's sister, too, is not a bad sort of girl. He\r\nhimself is too much of the virtuous, loyal, amiable, but not weak man of\r\nthe people; the marquis is rather null, and the duke, who jilts his\r\ncousin Claire de Beaulieu, gambles, marries a rich and detestable\r\ndaughter of a chocolate-man, and finally fires through Claire's fingers,\r\nis very much, to use our old phrase, _à la douzaine_. But Claire might\r\nsave the book, and probably does so for those who like it. To me she\r\nseems quite wrongly put together. The novel has been so very widely\r\nread, in the original and in translations, that it is perhaps\r\nunnecessary to waste space on a full analysis of its central scene--a\r\nthing not to be done very shortly. It may be sufficient to say that\r\nClaire, treacherously and spitefully informed, by her successful rival,\r\nof the fact that she has been jilted, and shortly afterwards confronted\r\nwith the jilter himself, recovers, as it seems to her, to the company,\r\nand I suppose to the author, the whip-hand by summoning the ironmaster\r\n(who is hanging about \"promiscuous,\" and is already known to be attached\r\nto her, though she has given him no direct encouragement) and bestowing\r\nher hand upon him, insisting, too, upon being married at once, before\r\nthe other pair. The act is supposed to be that of an exceptionally calm,\r\nhaughty, and aristocratic damsel: and the acceptance of it is made by a\r\nman certainly deep in love, but independent, sharp-sighted, and\r\nstrong-willed. To be sure, he could not very well refuse; but this very\r\nfact should have weighed additionally, with a girl of Claire's supposed\r\ntemperament, in deciding her not to make a special Leap Year for the\r\noccasion. To hand yourself over to Dick because Tom has declined to have\r\nanything to do with you is no doubt not a very unusual proceeding: but\r\nit is not usually done quite so much _coram populo_, or with such\r\nacknowledgment of its being done to spite Tom and Tom's preferred\r\none.[545]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Docteur Rameau._]\r\n\r\nTwo more of \"Les Batailles de la Vie\" (as, for some not too obvious[546]\r\nreason, it pleased M. Ohnet to _super_-title his novels) may perhaps\r\nsuffice to give a basis for a more general judgment of his position. _Le\r\nDocteur Rameau_ is, at least towards its close, one of the most\r\nambitious, if not _the_ most ambitious of all its author's books. The\r\nhero is one of those atheistic and republican physicians who are apt\r\nrather to _embêter_ us by their frequency in French novels. He is thrown\r\ninto the also familiar situation of ascertaining, after his wife's\r\ndeath, that she has been false, and that his daughter, of whom he is\r\nvery fond, is probably or certainly not his own. At the end, however,\r\nthings come right as usual. Rameau is converted from hating his\r\ndaughter, which is well, and from being an atheist, which is better.\r\nBut, unluckily, M. Ohnet devotes several pages, in his own peculiar\r\nstyle, to a rhetorical exhibition of the logic of these conclusions. It\r\nseems to come to this. There is no God and no soul, because freewill is\r\nsufficient to account for everything. But M. le Docteur Rameau has\r\nwilled, in the free-willingest manner, to hate his daughter, and finds\r\nhe cannot. Therefore there is a God and a soul. A most satisfactory\r\nconclusion, but a most singular major premiss. Why should there be no\r\nGod and no soul because there is (if there is) freewill?[547] But all is\r\nwell that ends well: and how can you end better than by being heard to\r\nejaculate, \"Mon Dieu!\" (quite seriously and piously, and not in the\r\nordinary trivial way) by a scientific friend, at the church of\r\nSainte-Clotilde, during your daughter's wedding?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Grande Marnière._]\r\n\r\n_La Grande Marnière_ does not aspire to such heights, and is perhaps one\r\nof the best \"machined\" of M. Ohnet's books. The main plot is not very\r\nnovel--his plots seldom are--and, in parts as well as plots, any one who\r\ncared for rag-picking and hole-picking might find a good deal of\r\nindebtedness. It is the old jealousy of a clever and unscrupulous\r\nself-made man towards an improvident _seigneur_ and his somewhat\r\nrobustious son. The seigniorial improvidence, however, is not of the\r\nusual kind, for M. le Marquis de Clairefont wastes his substance, and\r\ngets into his enemy's debt and power, by costly experiments on\r\nagricultural and other machinery, partly due to the fact that he\r\npossesses on his estate a huge marl-pit and hill which want developing.\r\nThere is the again usual cross-action of an at first hopeless affection\r\non the part of the _roturier's_ son, Pascal Carvajan, a rising lawyer,\r\nfor Antoinette de Clairefont. But M. Ohnet--still fertile in\r\nsituations--adds a useful sort of conspiracy among Carvajan's tools of\r\nvarious stations against the house of Clairefont; a conspiracy which\r\nactually culminates in a murder-charge against Robert de Clairefont, the\r\nvictim being the pretty daughter of a local poacher, one of the gang,\r\nwith whom the Viscount has notoriously and indeed quite openly flirted.\r\nNow comes Pascal's opportunity: he defends Robert, and not merely\r\nobtains acquittal, but manages to discover that the crime was actually\r\ncommitted by the village idiot, who betrays himself by remorse and\r\nsleep-walking. There is a patient, jilted lover, M. de Croix-Mesnil (it\r\nmay just be noted that since French novel-heroines were allowed any\r\nchoice at all in marriage, they have developed a faculty of altering\r\nthat choice which might be urged by praisers of times past against the\r\nenfranchisement); a comic aunt; and several other promoters of business.\r\nIt is no wonder that, given a public for the kind of book, this\r\nparticular example of it should have been popular. It had reached its\r\nsixtieth edition before it had been published a twelvemonth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reflections.]\r\n\r\nSixty editions of one book in one year; three hundred and sixty-seven of\r\nanother in twenty; a hundred and forty-two of _Serge Panine_ in five;\r\nsixty-nine of _Le Docteur Rameau_ in certainly at the outside not more;\r\nthese are facts which, whatever may be insinuated about the number of an\r\n\"edition,\" cannot be simply put aside. Popularity, as the wiser critics\r\nhave always maintained, is no test of excellence; but as they have also\r\nmaintained when they were wise, it is a \"fact in the case,\" and it will\r\nnot do merely to sneer at it. I should say that the popularity of M.\r\nOhnet, like other popularities in England as well as in France, is quite\r\nexplicable. Novel-writing, once again, had become a business, and he set\r\nhimself to carry that business out with a thorough comprehension of what\r\nwas wanted. His books, it is to be observed, are generally quite modern,\r\ndealing either with his own day or a few years before it; and modernity\r\nhas, for a long time, been almost a _sine qua non_ of what is to please\r\nthe public. They are, it has been said, full of situations, and the\r\nsituation is what pleases the public most in everything. They came just\r\nwhen the first popularity of Naturalism was exhausting itself,[548] and\r\nthey are not grimy; but, on the other hand, they do not aim at an\r\nexcessive propriety. Their characters are not of the best, or even of\r\nthe second-best class, as so often defined, but they are sufficient to\r\nwork out the situations without startling inadequacy. The public never\r\nreally cares, though part of it is sometimes taught to pretend to care,\r\nfor style, and the same may be said of the finer kind of description.\r\nThe conversation is not brilliant, but, like the character, it serves\r\nits turn. I once knew an excellent gentleman, of old lineage and fair\r\nfortune, who used to say that for his part he could not tell mutton from\r\nvenison or Marsala from Madeira, and he thanked God for it. The\r\nnovel-reading public,--that at least which reads novels by the three\r\nhundred and fifty thousand,--is very much of the same taste, and I am\r\nsure I hope it is equally pious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Édouard Rod.]\r\n\r\nI have quite a lively remembrance of the advent of M. Édouard Rod, of\r\nthe crowning of _Le Sens de la Vie_, and so forth. That advent formed\r\npart of the just mentioned counter-attack on Naturalism, in which, as\r\nusual, some of the Naturalist methods and weapons themselves were used;\r\nbut it had a distinct character of its own. Unless I mistake, it was not\r\nat first very warmly welcomed by \"mortal\" French criticism. There may\r\nhave been something in this of that curious grudge[549] against\r\nSwiss-French, on the part of purely French-French, men of letters which\r\nnever seems to have entirely ceased. But there was something more than\r\nthis, though this something more was in a way the reason, some might say\r\nthe justification, of the grudge. M. Rod was exceedingly serious; the\r\ntitle of his laureated book is of itself almost sufficient to show it;\r\nand though the exclusive notion of \"the gay and frivolous Frenchman\"\r\nalways was something of a vulgar error, and has been increasingly so\r\nsince the Revolution, Swiss seriousness, with its strong Germanic\r\nleaven, is not French seriousness at all. But he became, if not exactly\r\na popular novelist to the tune of hundreds or even scores of editions, a\r\nprolific and fairly accepted one. I think, though he died in middle age\r\nand produced other things besides novels, he wrote some twenty or thirty\r\nstories, and his production rather increased than slackened as he went\r\non. With the later ones I am not so well acquainted as with the earlier,\r\nbut there is a pervading character about these earlier ones which is not\r\nlikely to have changed much, and they alone belong strictly to our\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Vie Privée de Michel Teissier._]\r\n\r\nNext to _Le Sens de la Vie_ and perhaps in a way, as far as popularity\r\ngoes, above it, may be ranked, I suppose, _La Vie Privée de Michel\r\nTeissier_, with its sequel, _La Seconde Vie de M. T._ These books\r\ncertainly made a bold and wide separation of aim and subject from the\r\nsubject and the aim of most French novels in these recent years. Here\r\nyou have, instead of a man who attempts somebody else's wife, one who\r\nwishes to get rid--on at least legally respectable terms--of his own,\r\nand to marry a girl for whom he has, and who has for him, a passion\r\nwhich is, until legal matrimony enfranchises it, able to restrain itself\r\nfrom any practical satisfaction of the as yet illicit kind. He avails\r\nhimself of the then pretty new facilities for divorce (the famous \"Loi\r\nNaquet,\" which used to \"deave\" all of us who minded such things many\r\nyears ago), and the situation is (at least intentionally) made more\r\npiquant by the fact that Teissier, who is a prominent statesman and\r\ngives up not merely his wife but his political position for this new\r\nlove of his, starts as an actual supporter of the repeal of the divorce\r\nlaws. To an English reader, of course, the precise problem would not\r\nhave the same charm of novelty, except in his capacity as a reader of\r\nFrench novels. But, putting that aside, the position is obviously\r\ncapable of being treated with very considerable appeal. The struggles of\r\nthe husband, who _has_ loved his wife--M. Rod had not the audacity or\r\nthe strength to make him love her still--between his duties and his\r\ndesires; the indignant suffering of the wife; and most of all, the\r\nposition of the girl who, by ill-fortune or the fault of others, finds\r\nherself expending, on an at first illicit and always ill-famed love,\r\nwhat she might have devoted to an honourable one, certainly has great\r\ncapabilities. But I did not think when I read it first, and I do not\r\nthink now when I have read it again, that these various opportunities\r\nare fully taken. It is not that M. Rod has no idea of passion. He is\r\nconstantly handling it and, as will be seen presently, not without\r\nsuccess occasionally. But he was too much what he calls his eidolon in\r\none book, \"Monsieur le psychologue,\" and the Psyche he deals with is too\r\noften a skinny and spectacled creature--not the love of Cupid and the\r\nmother of Voluptas.[550]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Sacrifiée._]\r\n\r\nIf he has ever made his story hot enough to make this pale cast glow, it\r\nis in _La Sacrifiée_. This is all the more remarkable in that the\r\nbeginning of the book itself is far from promising. There is a rather\r\nunnecessary usher-chapter--a thing which M. Rod was fond of, and which,\r\nunless very cleverly done, is more of an obstacle than of a \"shoe-horn.\"\r\nThe hero-narrator of the main story is one of the obligatorily atheistic\r\ndoctors--nearly as great a nuisance as obligatorily adulterous\r\nheroines--whom M. Rod has mostly discarded; and what is more, he is one\r\nof the pseudo-scientific fanatics who believe in the irresponsibility of\r\nmurderers, and do not see that, the more irresponsible a criminal is,\r\nthe sooner he ought to be put out of the way. Moreover, he has the\r\nill-manners to bore the company at dinner with this craze, and the\r\nindecency (for which in some countries he might have smarted) to condemn\r\nout loud, in a court of justice, the verdict of the jury and the\r\nsentence of the judge on his pet. Neither can one approve the haste with\r\nwhich he suggests to the wife of his oldest and most intimate friend\r\nthat she is not happy with her husband. But this time M. Rod had got the\r\nforge working, and the bellows dead on the charcoal. The development of\r\nthe situation has something of that twist or boomerang effect which we\r\nhave noticed in _Michel Teissier_. Dr. Morgex begins by defending\r\nmurderers; he does not end, but starts the end, by becoming a murderer\r\nhimself, though one with far more \"extenuating circumstances\" than those\r\nso often allowed in French courts. His friend--who is an advocate of no\r\nmean powers but loose life and dangerously full habit--has, when the\r\ndoctor warns him against apoplexy, half scoffed, but also begged him, if\r\na seizure should take place, to afford him a chance of euthanasia\r\ninstead of lingering misery. The actual situation, though with stages\r\nand variations which are well handled, arises; the doctor, who has long\r\nsince been frantically in love with the wife, succumbs to the\r\ntemptation--which has been aggravated by the old request, by the\r\nsufferings of the victim, and by the urgent supplications of the family,\r\nthat he _shall_ give morphia to relieve these sufferings. He gives\r\nit--but in a dose which he knows to be lethal.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, and having gone through no little mental agony, he marries\r\nthe widow, who is in every sense perfectly innocent; and a brief period\r\nof happiness follows. But his own remorse continues; the well-meaning\r\nchatter of a lady, who has done much to bring about the marriage, and to\r\nwhom Morgex had unwarily mentioned \"obstacles,\" awakes the wife's\r\nsuspicion, and, literally, \"the murder is out.\" Morgex confesses, first\r\nto a lawyer friend, who, to his intense surprise, pronounces him legally\r\nguilty, of course, but morally excusable; then to a priest, who takes\r\nalmost exactly the opposite point of view, and admitting that the legal\r\ncrime may be excusable, declares the moral guilt not lessened; while he\r\npoints out that while the wages of iniquity are retained, no pardon can\r\nbe deserved or expected. And so the pair part. Morgex gives himself up\r\nto the hardest and least profitable practitioner-work. Of what the wife\r\ndoes we hear nothing. She has been perfectly guiltless throughout; she\r\nhas loved her second husband without knowing his crime, and after\r\nknowing it; and so she is \"La Sacrifiée.\" But this (as some would call\r\nit) sentimental appeal is not the real appeal of the book, though it is\r\ndelicately led up to from an early point. The gist throughout is the\r\ntempering and purifying of the character and disposition of Morgex\r\nhimself, through trial and love, through crime and sacrifice. It is not\r\nperfectly done. If it were, it would land the author at once in those\r\nupper regions of art which I cannot say I think he attains. But it is a\r\nvery remarkable \"try,\" and, with one other to be mentioned presently, it\r\nis nearest the goal of any of his books.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Silence._]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if he ever wrote a worse book than _Le Silence_, I\r\nhave not read, and I do not wish to read, that. The title is singularly\r\nunhappy. Silence is so much greater a thing than speech that a speaker,\r\nunless he is Shakespeare or Dante or Lucretius,[551] or at least the\r\nbest kind of Wordsworth, had better avoid the subject, avoid even the\r\nword for it. And M. Rod's examples of silence, preluded in each case\r\n(for the book has two parts) by one of those curious harbingerings of\r\nhis which are doubtfully satisfactory, are not what they call nowadays\r\n\"convincing.\" The first and longest--it is, indeed, much too long and\r\nmight have been more acceptable in twenty pages than in two\r\nhundred--deals with the usual triangle--brutal husband, suffering wife,\r\ninteresting lover. But the last two never declare themselves, or are\r\ndeclared; and they both die and make no sign. In the second part there\r\nis another triangle, where the illegitimate side is established and\r\nresults in a duel, the lover killing the husband and establishing\r\nhimself with the wife. But a stove for tea-making explodes; she loses\r\nher beauty, and (apparently for that reason) poisons herself, though it\r\ndoes not appear that her lover's love has been affected by the change.\r\nIn each case the situation comes under that famous and often-quoted ban\r\nof helpless and unmanageable misery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Là-Haut._]\r\n\r\nNor can I think highly of _Là-Haut_, which is quite literally an account\r\nof an Alpine village, and of its gradual vulgarisation by an\r\nenterprising man of business. Of the ordinary novel-interests there is\r\nlittle more than the introduction at the beginning of a gentleman who\r\nhas triangled as usual, till, the husband has, in his, the lover's,\r\npresence, most inconsiderately shot his wife dead, has missed (which was\r\na pity) M. Julien Sterny himself, and, more unconscionably still, has\r\nbeen acquitted by a court of justice, in which the officials, and the\r\npublic in general, actually seemed to think that M. Sterny was to blame!\r\nHe is much upset by this, and, coming to Vallanches to recuperate, is\r\nrewarded later for his good deeds and sufferings,[552] by the hand of a\r\nvery attractive young woman with a fortune. This poetic justice,\r\nhowever, is by no means the point of the book, which, indeed, has no\r\nparticular point. It is filled up by details of Swiss hotel-life: of the\r\nwicked conduct of English tourists, who not merely sing hymns on Sunday,\r\nbut dance on wet evenings in the week (nearly the oddest combination of\r\ncrimes known to the present writer); of a death in climbing of one of\r\nthe characters which is not in the least required by the story; of the\r\nscalding of her arm by a _paysanne_ in a sort of \"ragging\" flirtation,\r\nand the operation on the mortifying member by a curé who knows\r\nsomething of chirurgy; and of the ruin of some greedy peasants who turn\r\ntheir châlet into a hotel with no capital to work it, and are bought\r\nout, with just enough to cover their outlay and leave them penniless, by\r\nthe general _entrepreneur_. It is a curious book, but the very reverse\r\nof a successful one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _La Course à la Mort._]\r\n\r\nThe centre, not by any means in the chronological sense (for they were\r\namong his earliest), but in the logical and psychological, of M. Rod's\r\nnovel production, is undoubtedly to be found in the two contrastedly\r\ntitled books _Le Sens de la Vie_ and _La Course à la Mort_. The first,\r\nwhich, as has been said, received Academic distinction, I approached\r\nmany years ago without any predisposition against it, and closed with a\r\ndistinct feeling of disappointment. The other I read more recently with\r\na distinct apprehension of disapproval, which was, if not entirely, to a\r\nvery large extent removed as I went on. It was strongly attacked as\r\nmorbid and mischievous at its first appearance in 1885; and the author,\r\nsome years afterwards, prefixed a defence to his fifth edition, which is\r\nnot much more effective than such defences usually are. It takes\r\nsomething like the line which, as was mentioned above, Mr. Traill took\r\nabout Maupassant--that Pessimism was a fact like other facts, and one\r\nwas entitled to take it as a subject or motive. But it also contained a\r\nslip into that obvious but, somehow or other, seldom avoided trap--the\r\nargument that a book is \"dramatic,\" and does not necessarily express the\r\nauthor's own attitude. Perhaps not; but the rejoinder that almost all,\r\nif not all, M. Rod's books are \"sicklied o'er\" in this way is rather\r\nfatal. One gets to expect, and seldom misses, a close and dreary air\r\nthroughout, often aggravated by an actual final sentence or paragraph of\r\nlamentation and mourning and woe. But I do not resent the \"nervous\r\nimpression\" left on me by _La Course à la Mort_, with its indefinitely\r\nstated but certain end of suicide, and its unbroken soliloquy of dreary\r\ndream. For it is in one key all through; it never falls out of tune or\r\ntime; and it does actually represent a true, an existent, though a\r\npartial and morbid attitude of mind. It is also in parts very well\r\nwritten, and the blending of life and dream is sometimes almost Poesque.\r\nA novel, except by the extremest stretch of courtesy, it is not, being\r\nsimply a panorama of the moods of its scarcely heroic hero. And he does\r\nnot \"set one's back up\" like René, or, in my case at least, produce\r\nboredom like most of the other \"World-pain\"-ers. The still more shadowy\r\nappearances of the heroine Cécile, who dies before her lover, while the\r\ncourse of his love is more dream than action, are well brought in and\r\nattractive; and there is one passage descriptive of waltzing which would\r\natone for anything. Many people have tried to write about waltzing, but\r\nfew have done it well; this is almost adequate. I wonder if I dare\r\ntranslate it?\r\n\r\n     We never thought that people might be turning an evil eye on\r\n     us; we cared nothing for the indignation of the mammas\r\n     sitting passive and motionless; we hardly felt the couples\r\n     that we jostled.[553] Thanks to the cradling of the rhythm,\r\n     to the intoxication of our rapid and regular movement, there\r\n     fell on us something like a great calm. Drunk with one\r\n     another, hurried by the absorbing voluptuousness of the\r\n     waltz, we went on and on vertiginously. People and things\r\n     turned with us, surrounding us with a gyre of moving\r\n     shadows, under a fantastic light formed of crossing\r\n     reflections, in an atmosphere where one breathed inebriating\r\n     perfumes, and where every atom vibrated to the ever more\r\n     bewildering sound of music. Time passed, and we still went\r\n     on; losing little by little all consciousness except that of\r\n     our own movement. Then it even seemed that we came out of\r\n     ourselves; we heard nothing but a single beat, marking the\r\n     cadence with strokes more and more muffled. The lights,\r\n     melting into one, bathed us in a dreamy glow; we felt not\r\n     the floor under our feet; we felt nothing but an immense\r\n     oblivion--the oblivion of a void which was swallowing us up.\r\n\r\nAnd doubtless it was so, as has been seen of many in the Time of\r\nRoses.[554]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Le Ménage du Pasteur Naudié._]\r\n\r\nTo take one or two more of his books, _Le Ménage du Pasteur Naudié_,\r\nthough less poignant than _La Sacrifiée_ and with no approach to the\r\nextra-novelish merit of _La Course à la Mort_, starts not badly with an\r\ninteresting scene, no less a place than La Rochelle, very rarely met,\r\nsince its great days, in a French novel--a rather unfamiliar society,\r\nthat of French Protestantism at Rochelle itself and Montauban--and a\r\ncertainly unusual situation, the desire of a young, pretty, and wealthy\r\ngirl, Jane Defos, to marry an elderly pastor who is poor, and, though a\r\nwidower, has four children.\r\n\r\nThat nothing but mischief can come of this proceeding--as of an abnormal\r\nleap-year--is clear enough: whether the way in which the mischief is\r\nbrought about and recounted is good may be more doubtful. That a person\r\nlike M. Naudié, simple, though by no means a fool, should be taken in by\r\na very pretty girl falling apparently in love with him--even though, to\r\nthe general dangers of the situation, are added frank warnings that she\r\nhas been given to a series of freakish fancies--is not unnatural; that\r\nshe should soon tire of him, and sooner still of the four step-children,\r\nis very natural indeed. But the immediate cause of the final\r\ndisruption--her taking a new fancy to, and being atheistically converted\r\nby, a cousin who, after all, runs away from temptation--is not very\r\nnatural, and is unconvincingly told. Indeed the whole character of Jane\r\nis insufficiently presented. She is meant to be a sort of Blanche Amory,\r\nwith nothing real in her--only a succession of false and fleeting\r\nfancies. But M. Rod was not Thackeray.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mademoiselle Annette._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _L'Eau Courante._]\r\n\r\nWith two or three more of his later-middle books (it does not seem\r\nnecessary to deal with the very latest, which are actually beyond our\r\nlimit, and could not alter the general estimate very favourably) the\r\npreparation of judgment may cease. _Mademoiselle Annette_ is the history\r\nof a \"house-angel\" and her family, and the fortunes and misfortunes they\r\ngo through, and the little town of Bielle on the Lake of Geneva.[555] It\r\nis told, rather in M. Ferdinand Fabre's way, by a bystander, from the\r\ntime when the heroine was his school-dame and, as such dames sometimes,\r\nif not often, are, adored by her pupils. Annette dies at last, and M.\r\nRod strews the dust of many others on her way to death. An American\r\nbrother of the typical kind plays a large part. He is tamed partly by\r\nAnnette, partly by a charming wife, whom M. Rod must needs kill, without\r\nany particular reason. _L'Eau Courante_ is an even gloomier story. It\r\nbegins with a fair picture of a home-coming of bride and bridegroom, on\r\na beautiful evening, to an ideal farm high up on the shore of Leman. In\r\na very few pages M. Rod, as usual, kills the wife after subjecting her\r\nto exceptional tortures at the births of her children, and then settles\r\ndown comfortably to tell us the ruin of the husband, who ends by arson\r\nof his own lost home and drowning in his own lost pond. The interval is\r\nall blunder, misfortune, and folly--the chief _causa malorum_ being a\r\nsenseless interference with the \"servitude\" rights of neighbours, whom\r\nhe does not like, by stopping, for a week, a spring on his own land.\r\nAlmost the only cheerful character in the book (except a delightful\r\n_juge de conciliation_, who carries out his benevolent duties in his\r\ncellar, dispensing its contents to soften litigants) is a black\r\nbilly-goat named Samuel, who, though rather diabolical, is in a way the\r\n\"Luck of the Bertignys,\" and after selling whom their state is doomed.\r\nBut we see very little of him.\r\n\r\nThe summing up need probably not be long. That M. Rod was no mere\r\nstuffer of the shelves of circulating libraries must have been made\r\nclear; that he could write excellently has been (with all due modesty)\r\nconfessed; that he could sometimes be poignant, often vivid, even\r\noccasionally humorous, is true. He has given us a fresh illustration of\r\nthat tendency of the later novel, to \"fill all numbers\" of ordinary\r\nlife, which has been insisted upon. But that he is too much of a \"dismal\r\nJemmy\" of novel-writing is certainly true also. The House of Mourning is\r\none of the Houses of Life, and therefore open to the novelist. But it is\r\nnot the _only_ house. It would sometimes seem as if M. Rod were (as\r\nusual without his being able to help it) a sort of _jettatore_,--as if\r\nthere were no times or places for him except that\r\n\r\n    When all the world is old,\r\n      And all the trees are brown,\r\n    And all the sport is cold,\r\n      And all the wheels run down.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scènes de la Vie Cosmopolite._]\r\n\r\nBut there is something to add, and even one book not yet noticed to\r\ncomment on, which may serve as a real light on this remarkable novelist.\r\nThe way in which I have already spoken of _La Course à la Mort,_ which\r\nwas a very early book, may be referred to. Even earlier, or at least as\r\nearly, M. Rod wrote some short stories, which were published as _Scènes\r\nde la Vie Cosmopolite_. They include \"Lilith\" (the author, though far\r\nfrom an Anglophile, had a creditable liking for Rossetti), which is a\r\nstory of the rejection of a French suitor by an English governess; the\r\nending of a liaison between a coxcomb and a lady much older than himself\r\n(\"Le Feu et l'Eau\"); \"L'Idéal de M. Gindre,\" with a doubtful\r\nmarriage-close; a discovery of falseness (\"Le Pardon\"); \"La Dernière\r\nIdylle\" (which may be judged from some of its last words: \"I have made a\r\nspectacle of myself long enough, and now the play is over\"), and \"Noces\r\nd'Or,\" the shortest and bitterest of all, in which the wife, who has\r\nfelt herself tyrannised over for the fifty years, mildly retaliates by\r\nproviding for dinner _nearly_ all the things that she likes and her\r\nhusband does not, though she effects a reconciliation with _pâté de\r\ncanard d'Amiens_. I wonder if they ate duck-pies at Amiens in the spring\r\nof 1918?\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this postscript-account, and of the reference to _La\r\nCourse_, should not be very obscure. It is clear that, at first and from\r\nthe first, M. Rod's vocation was to be a prophet of discouragement and\r\ndisappointment. You may be this and be quite a major prophet; but if you\r\nare not a major prophet your minority will become somewhat painfully\r\napparent, and it will often, if not always, go near to failure. I think\r\nthis was rather the case with M. Rod.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Catulle Mendès.]\r\n\r\nIt is with reluctance that I find myself unable to give more than praise\r\nfor admirable French, and \"form\" in the strict sense, to the work in\r\nprose fiction of M. Catulle Mendès, sometime Gautier's son-in-law[556]\r\nand always, I think, his disciple. His early verse-work in the _Parnasse\r\nContemporain_ fifty years ago, was attractive and promising, though\r\nperhaps open to the exception which some took to the _Parnasse_\r\ngenerally, and which may be echoed here, _not_ with that general\r\nconcernment, but as to his own novel and tale-work. His late critical\r\nsurvey of modern French poetry was a really difficult thing admirably\r\ndone. But his fiction leaves me cold, as Parnassian poetry did others,\r\nbut not me. A friend of mine, whom I should have thought quite\r\nunshockable, either by principles or practice, once professed himself to\r\nme aghast at _Méphistophéla_. But M. Mendès's improprieties neither\r\nshock nor excite nor amuse me, because they have a certain air of being\r\n\"machined.\" If anybody wishes to sample them at their very best, the\r\nhalf-score loosely and largely printed pages of \"Tourterelle\" in the\r\nvolume entitled _Lesbia_ will be no severe experiment. He may then take\r\nhis choice of not going further at all, or of going further at the\r\nhazard of faring worse, or as well now and then, but hardly, I think,\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI do not propose to add any further studies in detail to those already\r\npresented in this chapter. As I have (perhaps more than once) remarked,\r\nthere are few periods of the century with the minor as well as major\r\nnovel work of which I am better acquainted than with that of its last\r\nquarter. As I remember independently, or am in this or that way\r\nreminded, of the names of Jules de Glouvet; of at least three\r\nPauls--Alexis, Arène, and Mahalin; of Ernest d'Hervilly; of the prolific\r\nHector Malot; of Oscar Meténier, and Octave Mirbeau, and Jules Vallès of\r\nthe Commune, of the brothers Margueritte and of others too many to\r\nmention, a sort of shame invades me at leaving them out.[557] Some of\r\nthem may be alive still, though most, I think, are dead. But dead or\r\nalive, I have no room for them, and, for reasons also elsewhere stated,\r\nit is perhaps as well. The blossoming of the aloe, not once in a hundred\r\nyears but all through them, has been told as best I could tell it.\r\n\r\nNot shame but sorrow attends the exclusion of others, some of them, I\r\nthink, better novelists than those actually discussed in this\r\nchapter--especially \"Gyp\" and MM. Anatole France, Paul Bourget, Jean\r\nRichepin, and \"Pierre Loti.\" It would have been agreeable to pay, once\r\nmore, suit and service to the adorable chronicler of the little rascal\r\nBob and the unpretentiously divine Chiffon; to recall the delighted\r\nsurprise with which one read _Le Crime de Silvestre Bonnard_, and follow\r\nthe train of triumphs that succeeded it; to do justice (unbribed, but\r\npleasantly seasoned, by some private gratitude) to the vigour and\r\nacuteness of _L'Irréparable_ and its companions; to salute that\r\nmasterpiece of Realism at its best, _La Glu_, and the more complicated\r\nas well as more pathetic history of _Césarine_; and to re-discover the\r\ncountries and the manners depicted for us from _Aziyadé_ to _Pêcheur\r\nd'Islande_. But the _consigne_ elsewhere laid down and experienced\r\nforbids it, and I think that _consigne_ should not be \"forced.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[519] It was in connection with this, at some time in the 'eighties,\r\nthat I came across a curious survival of the old prejudice against\r\nnovels--deserving perhaps, with better claim than as a mere personal\r\nanecdote, record in this history. One French publisher, who held himself\r\nabove the \"three-fifty,\" and produced dainty books of art and letters,\r\nonce sent a pathetic remonstrance against his wares being reviewed\r\n\"sometimes unkindly, _and always with the novels_.\"\r\n\r\n[520] \"Tigrane\" is a nickname, early accounted for and perhaps\r\nsuggesting its own explanation.\r\n\r\n[521] At the extreme end there is an interesting reminder of that\r\ncurious moment when it was thought on the cards that Pius IX. might\r\naccept an English asylum at Malta, and that, as a part-consequence, not\r\nof course Newman but Manning might be his successor. The probable\r\nresults of this, to \"those who knew\" at the time, are still matter of\r\ninteresting, if unpractical, speculation.\r\n\r\n[522] He is playing whist comfortably with the cathedral keys in his\r\npocket, and has nearly made a slam (Fr. _chelem_), while the pelting of\r\nthe pitiless storm is on the dead bishop's bier and its faithful\r\nguardians.\r\n\r\n[523] There is something Browningesque about it, a something by no means\r\nconfined to the use of the history--actually referred to in the text,\r\nbut likely to be anticipated long before by readers--of Popes Formosus\r\nand Stephen. That it did not satisfy Ultramontanes is not surprising;\r\n_v. inf._ on one of the smaller pieces in _Norine_.\r\n\r\n[524] He had actually been intended for the Church.\r\n\r\n[525] One thing, for the credit of the Gallican Church, we may trust\r\nthat he did _not_ do. An Anglican prelate, like this his brother on a\r\nConfirmation tour, is alleged to have pointed to a decanter on his\r\nhost's sideboard and said, \"I hope, on my next visit, I shall not see\r\n_that_.\" I do not know what the rector answered: I do know what _I_\r\nshould have said, despite my reverence for the episcopate: \"My Lord, you\r\nwill not have the opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n[526] _La Rue du Puits qui Parle_ and _Le Carmel de Vaugirard_.\r\n\r\n[527] The _Société des Secours Intellectuels_.\r\n\r\n[528] See on Murger.\r\n\r\n[529] Whenever she hears that any of her numerous lovers has fallen ill,\r\nshe promptly \"plants there\" the man in possession, and tends and, as far\r\nas she can, supports the afflicted.\r\n\r\n[530] _Vide_ the frontispiece of Settle's _Empress of Morocco_.\r\n\r\n[531] It would be curmudgeonly to say, \"evaded by shortness of space.\"\r\n\r\n[532] They are, however, orthodox after a fashion; and I do not think\r\nthat M. Fabre, in the books that I have read, ever introduces\r\ndescendants of the Camisards, though dealing with their country.\r\n\r\n[533] M. Fabre is so fond of these interrupted _récits_ that one is\r\nsometimes reminded of _Jacques le Fataliste_ and its landlady. But, to\r\ndo him justice, he \"does it more natural.\"\r\n\r\n[534]\r\n\r\n     \"Come to thy death,\r\n     Victor _Galbraith_.\"--LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n[535] See note above on M. Fabre's weakness for this style of narrative.\r\n\r\n[536] The next to be mentioned runs him hard perhaps.\r\n\r\n[537] Her girls are perhaps as good, but scarcely her men.\r\n\r\n[538] This had _not_ been the case--to an extent which I am puzzled to\r\naccount for--with those of M. Fabre.\r\n\r\n[539] _Deformem vocant quidam_, as in other cases also: but that is\r\nbecause she has eyes and they have none.\r\n\r\n[540] For instance, in Highbury or Cranford there might be scandal about\r\na young bachelor's very late visits to a pretty widow. But the adult\r\nportion of the population, at any rate, would hardly lay booby-traps to\r\ntrip him in a river on his return.\r\n\r\n[541] An old schoolmaster, whom Raymonde has deeply offended by\r\nupsetting his just-gathered mushrooms at the beginning of the book, and\r\nwho is warmly attached to Antoine, turns out to be the girl's legal\r\nfather--her mother, a disagreeable, handsome person, having been run\r\naway twenty years earlier by another character who has passed hitherto\r\nas respectable husband and paterfamilias.\r\n\r\n[542] Excepting some of the \"Johnny Ludlow\" stories, which were, I\r\nthink, in their kind, better than anything M. Ohnet ever did to my\r\nknowledge--I may perhaps observe that the above notice was written,\r\nexactly as it stands, _before_ M. Ohnet's death, but under the\r\nimpression that the death had occurred. When it did, there were things\r\nin the obituaries which made me raise my eyebrows. That he was a\r\n\"belated Romantic\" had certainly never occurred to me; but I have no\r\nquarrel with the description of him, in another place, as a practitioner\r\nof the _roman bourgeois_.\r\n\r\n[543] _V. sup._ p. 277-280.\r\n\r\n[544] The great scene in Mr. Disraeli's _Young Duke_, when that youthful\r\nnobleman loses, what is it? two hundred and seventeen thousand pounds, I\r\nthink; the brief but poignant plucking of Mr. Dawkins; the occasion in\r\n_Sans Merci_ where the hero _will_ not lead trumps, and thereby, though\r\nnot at once, seals his fate; and a quite nice game at Marmora in Mr. E.\r\nF. Benson's _The Babe, B.A._ emerge from many memories, reinforced by\r\nsome of actual experience. Marmora _is_ a nice game: with penny stakes,\r\nand three players only, you may have five pounds in the pool before you\r\nknow where you are. But I do not know anything more really exciting than\r\na game at which you guess how many marbles the other fellow holds in his\r\nfist. The sequel, however, in which you have to ask for an advance of\r\npocket-money to settle your \"differences\", is not so pleasant.\r\n\r\n[545] Another scene, which brings on the _dénouement_ and in which\r\nClaire is again supposed to have the _beau rôle_, does not please me\r\nmuch better. Thinking that her husband is flirting with the detested\r\nDuchess, she publicly orders her out of the house--a very natural, but a\r\nrather \"fish-faggy\" proceeding.\r\n\r\n[546] It has been, and will be, pointed out that he was in all ways\r\nstudious to run before the wind; and it was just at this time, if I\r\nremember rightly, that the catchword of \"conflict\" began to pester one\r\nin criticism. Perhaps this was the reason.\r\n\r\n[547] The argument, or assumption rather, is all the odder because, on\r\nthe one hand, orthodoxy holds Free-will (if it accepts that) as a Divine\r\nendowment of the Soul: and, on the other, serious Atheism is almost\r\nalways Determinist. But the study of M. Ohnet was probably not much\r\namong the Sentences.\r\n\r\n[548] The obituarist above mentioned, who thought M. Ohnet a belated\r\nRomantic, thought also that he was \"struggling against the rising tide\r\nof Realism.\" I do not think you would ever have found him struggling\r\nagainst rising tides, and, as a matter of fact, the tide was already on\r\nthe turn.\r\n\r\n[549] Already mentioned in the case of M. Cherbuliez (_v. sup._ p. 447).\r\n\r\n[550]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Note on _La Seconde Vie de M. T._]\r\n\r\nThe second part is occupied with two different but connected subjects.\r\nSuzanne, the first wife, dies suddenly, and the two daughters, the\r\nelder, Annie, quite, and the second, Laurence, nearly grown up--return\r\nto the custody of their father, and therefore to the society at least of\r\nhis second wife, Blanche, who, though of course feeling the awkwardness,\r\nwelcomes them as well as she can. The situation, though much _more_\r\nawkward, is something like that of Miss Yonge's _Young Stepmother_: but\r\nM. Rod makes it more tragic by Annie's death, partly in consequence of a\r\nlove-marriage failing, through the lover's father's objection to the\r\nstate of her family. The other subject is the gradual hankering of\r\nMichel after a return to political life, and his (consequentially\r\ninevitable) ratting from Right to Left. M. Rod brought into the matter\r\ndirect reminiscences of the Parnell and Dilke cases, and possibly owed\r\nthe conception of the whole book to them; but he has, as is sometimes\r\nhis wont, rather \"sicklied it over\" with political and other discussion.\r\n\r\n[551] A pleasant study, in poetic use of imagery and phrase, is the\r\ngradation from the bare and grand Lucretian simplicity of _silentia\r\nnoctis_, through the \"favour and prettiness\" (slightly tautological\r\nthough) of the Virgilian _tacitae per amica silentia lunae_, to the\r\nrecovery and intensifying of magnificence in _dove il sol tace_. By the\r\nway, _silentia_ (for the singular undergoes Quintilian's apology for the\r\nLatin _-um_) is one of the few instances in which a Latin word beats the\r\nGreek. [Greek: sigê] is really inferior.\r\n\r\n[552] What annoys him most of all is that he should have an\r\nuncomfortable feeling about the woman \"_comme_ si je l'avais _aimée_!\"\r\nHe had only, you see, done something else.\r\n\r\n[553] They should not have done this, and I do not think they did; it\r\nwas the couples that jostled them. And even this ought not to have\r\nhappened. The fastest waltzing (I am speaking of the old _deux-temps_,\r\nwhich this must have been) conveyed an almost uncanny extra power of\r\nvision, and at the same time of avoidance, to the right persons. Indeed,\r\nthe first three lines of this extract have been objected to as base and\r\ninconsistent. I think not; the common out of which you rise to the\r\nuncommon is worth indication.\r\n\r\n[554] It may be added that the contrast of an earlier mazurka--in the\r\nslowness of which the pair had time to look at each other, feel each\r\nother, and otherwise remain in Paradise, but outside of the double\r\nNirvana--is highly creditable. But I hope they _waltzed_ to the mazurka.\r\nIt is rather annoying to other people who are doing the orthodox step;\r\nbut it is the perfection of the slow movement, which affords, as above,\r\nopportunities that do not exist in the faster and more delirious\r\ngyration.\r\n\r\n[555] This (which may be called M. Rod's novel-headquarters) occurs also\r\nnot merely in _L'Eau Courante_ but in _Les Roches Blanches_, a book\r\nwhich opens very well in a Mrs. Gaskell or Mrs. Oliphant vein, with the\r\nintroduction of a new pastor, but ends much less satisfactorily, with a\r\nguiltless but not at all convincing love-affair between this pastor and\r\nthe wife of his chief parishioner.\r\n\r\n[556] His wife for a time, Madame Judith Gautier, who died very\r\nrecently, wrote in a fashion not unworthy of her blood both in verse and\r\nprose (part of her production being translations from Chinese), and was\r\nthe only lady-member of the quaint _Contre_-académie formed by E. de\r\nGoncourt.\r\n\r\n[557] And this shame becomes more acute when I think of one or two\r\nindividual books, such especially as M. Henry Cochin's _Manuscrit de\r\nMonsieur C. A. L. Larsonnier_--a most pathetic and delightful story of a\r\nmental malady which makes time and memory seem to go backward though the\r\nvictim can force himself to continue his ordinary duties, and record his\r\nsufferings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remaining pages of this book should be occupied partly with a\r\ncontinuation of a former chapter,[558] partly with a summary of the\r\nwhole volume, the combination, almost necessary in all cases, being\r\nspecially motived in this by the overlappings referred to above, and a\r\nword added on the whole _History_. Not only did Victor Hugo hold, to\r\nFrench literature as well as to French poetry, something very like the\r\nposition[559] occupied by Tennyson and Browning in English poetry only,\r\nby covering every quarter of the century in whole or part with his work;\r\nbut there was, even in France, nothing like the \"general post\" of\r\ndisappearances and accessions which marked the period from 1820 to 1860\r\nin English--a consequence necessarily of the later revival of French. No\r\none except Chateaubriand corresponded to the crowd of distinguished\r\nwriters who thus made their appearance, at the actual meeting of\r\neighteenth and nineteenth, with us; and though, of course, there were\r\nexceptions, the general body of the French reinforcement did not dwindle\r\nmuch till 1870 onwards.\r\n\r\nWe noted that the first great development of the nineteenth-century\r\nnovel was in the historical department, though many others made notable\r\nfresh starts: and we said something about the second development of the\r\n\"ordinary\" one which followed. It is this latter, of course, which has\r\nsupplied the main material of the last third of the present volume,\r\nthough (of course again) there have been many noteworthy and some great\r\nexamples of the historical itself, of the supernatural, of the\r\neccentric, and of many other kinds. But practically all who tried these\r\nlater tried the ordinary, and a great many who tried the ordinary did\r\nnot try the others. It is therefore on the development of the novel of\r\ncommon modern life that we must, at any rate for a little time, spend\r\nmost of our attention here.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the change is indeed so certain and so obvious, that there\r\nis not much need to enforce or illustrate it, though it must be\r\nremembered that, on any true conception of history, the most obvious\r\nthings are not those least worthy of being chronicled. Even Hugo, likely\r\nto be, and actually being, the most recalcitrant to the movement, comes\r\nclose to modern times, and to such ordinary life as was possible to him,\r\nin _Les Misérables_ and _Les Travailleurs de la Mer_. George Sand had\r\nbegun as a sort of modernist; but by any one who can perform the (it is\r\ntrue not very easy) task of equating relative modernity, it will not be\r\nfound that _Mlle. la Quintinie_, or even _Flamarande_, are more modern\r\nthan _Lélia_ or _Valentine_ in the mere ratio of the dates. The ordinary\r\nlife of the 'thirties and that of the 'sixties and 'seventies was no\r\ndoubt different, but there is more than that difference in the books\r\nreferred to. The artist is, consciously or unconsciously, trying to get\r\nnearer to her model or sitter. And this though George Sand was really\r\nalmost as self-centred as Hugo, though in another way.\r\n\r\nBut it is, of course, in less idiosyncratic writers than these, who\r\ncontinued, and in others who began, to write at this time, that we must\r\nlook for our real documents. Among the elder of this second class, Jules\r\nSandeau's work is worth recurring to. He had sometimes gone a little\r\nearlier than his own time, and he had sometimes employed what is\r\ncalled--perhaps inconsiderately and certainly to some extent\r\nmisleadingly--\"romantic\" incident in addition to purely novel-character\r\nand presentation. But his general manner of dealing reproduces itself,\r\nalmost more than that of any of his contemporaries, in those novelists\r\nof the last quarter of the century who do not bow the knee to\r\nNaturalism: and one finds some actual recognition of the fact in\r\ndedications to him by younger novelists such as M. André Theuriet.[560]\r\n\r\nBut, look where you will, the lesson is unmistakable. Take Alexandre\r\nDumas _fils_, beginning with a _Tristan le Roux_ and ending with an\r\n_Affaire Clémenceau_. Take Flaubert's _Madame Bovary_ and _L'Éducation\r\nSentimentale_, in comparison with which _Salammbô_ and two of the _Trois\r\nContes_ (the other is quite in the general drift) are obvious\r\nvariations, excursions, reliefs.[561] Feuillet is practically (whatever\r\nmay have been his early practice as a \"devil\"), when he takes to his own\r\nline, modern, and in a sense ordinary or nothing: Daudet the same.\r\nNaturalism _en bloc_ would lose almost all pretence of justifying itself\r\nif it did not stick to the ordinary, or at least actual, though it may\r\nsometimes be a sort of transformed \"ordinariness in abnormality.\" So\r\ngreat and so fertile a writer as Maupassant leaves us--except in his\r\nsupernaturalisms--nothing at all that goes out of the actual probable or\r\neasily possible experience of a Frenchman of 1880-90. The four novelists\r\nwho supply the bulk of the last chapter never outstep this. But since\r\nsuch indulgence in particulars may be thought mere driving at an open\r\ndoor, let us take the fact for granted, and turn to some consideration\r\nof its causes, results, conditions, features, and the like.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes is of such certainty and importance that a person, not\r\nindolent or prejudiced, might ask for no other. It is that sempiternal\r\ndesire for change[562]--that principle of revolution, which is so much\r\nmore certain than any evolution, and which governs human life, though it\r\nis always bringing that life back to the old places, \"camouflaged,\" as\r\nthey say nowadays, in a fashion that disguises them to the simple. The\r\nromance of incident, historical and other, had had a long innings, and\r\npeople were tired of it. But though this was undoubtedly the main\r\ninfluence, there were some others which it would be hardly judicious to\r\nneglect. It is true that the greatest of these were, in a fashion, only\r\npartial actions or reactions of the larger one already mentioned.[563]\r\nBeyle and Balzac, the latter of course with important \"colours\" of his\r\nown, and even the former with some modifications, had, as men of genius\r\ngenerally do, felt or found the spirit of change early, and their\r\naudiences helped to spread it. And yet minor impulsions might be\r\nindicated. It is a commonplace that from the days of the Napoleonic War\r\nto the middle 'fifties there were few great European events; commercial\r\nprogress, developments of colonisation, machinery, literature, and the\r\narts, somewhat peddling politics,[564] and the like taking the place of\r\nthe big wars and the grandiose revolutions that ushered in the\r\nnineteenth century. But these mostly meaner things themselves claimed\r\nattention; they filled the life of men if they did not glorify it;\r\nclasses and occupations which had been almost altogether non-vocal began\r\nto talk and be talked about, and so the change again held on.\r\n\r\nLastly, of course, there was the increase of education: with which the\r\ndemand for fiction, plentiful in quantity and easily comprehended, was\r\nsure to grow.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, the results concern us more than the causes. What\r\nis the general character of this large province, or, looking at it in\r\nanother way, of these accumulated crops, which the fifty years more\r\nspecially in question saw added to the prose fiction of France?\r\n\r\nThe answer is pretty much what any wide student of history--political,\r\nsocial, literary, or other--would expect, supposing, which is of course\r\nin fact an impossibility, that he could come to the particular study\r\n\"fresh and fasting.\" Novel-writing in France, as elsewhere, became more\r\nand more a business; and so, while the level of craftsmanship might be\r\nto some extent raised, the level of artistic excellence was\r\ncorrespondingly lowered. It has been before observed more than once\r\nthat, to the present critic, only Flaubert and Maupassant of the writers\r\nwe have been discussing in these later chapters can be credited with\r\npositive genius, unless the too often smoky and malodorous torch of Zola\r\nbe admitted to qualify for the Procession of the Chosen. But when we\r\ntake in the whole century the retrospect is very different; and while\r\nthe later period may suffer slightly in the respect just indicated, the\r\nearlier affords it some compensation in the other noted point.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, no exact parallel, in any literature or any branch of\r\nliterature within my knowledge, to the manifold development of the\r\nFrench novel during these hundred years. Our own experience in the same\r\ndepartment cannot be set in any proper comparison with it, for the four\r\ngreat novelists of the mid-eighteenth century, and their followers from\r\nMiss Burney downwards, with the Terror and the Political schools of the\r\nextreme close, had advanced our starting-point so far that Scott and\r\nMiss Austen possessed advantages not open to any French writer. On the\r\nother hand, the Sensibility School, which was far more numerously\r\nattended in France than in England, gave other openings, which _were_\r\ntaken advantage of in a special direction by Benjamin Constant, and much\r\nearlier and less brilliantly, but still with important results, by\r\nMadame de Montolieu. The age-long competence of the French in _conte_\r\nand _nouvelle_ was always ready for fresh adaptation; and at the very\r\nbeginning of the new century, and even earlier, two reinforcements of\r\nthe most diverse character came to the French novel. Pigault-Lebrun and\r\nDucray-Duminil (the earliest of whose novels appeared just before the\r\nRevolution as Pigault's début was made just after it) may be said to\r\nhave democratised the novel to nearly[565] the full meaning of that much\r\nabused word. They lowered its value aesthetically, ethically (at least\r\nin Pigault's case, while Ducray's morality does not go much above the\r\n\"Be amiable and honest\" standard), logically, rhetorically, and in a\r\ngood many other ways. But they did not merely increase the number of its\r\nreaders; in so doing they multiplied correspondingly the number of its\r\npractitioners, and so they helped to make novel-writing a business\r\nand--through many failures and half-successes--to give it a sort of\r\nregularised practice, if not a theory.\r\n\r\nYet if this democratisation of the novel thus went partly but, as does\r\nall democratisation inevitably, to the degradation of it in quality,\r\nthough to its increase in quantity, there were fortunately other\r\ninfluences at work to provide new reinforcements, themselves in some\r\ncases of quality invaluable. It has been admitted that neither\r\nChateaubriand nor Madame de Staël can be said to have written a\r\nfirst-class novel--even _Corinne_ can hardly be called that. But it is\r\nnearer thereto than anything that had been written since the first part\r\nof _La Nouvelle Héloïse_: while _René_ and _Atala_ recover, and more\r\nthan recover in tragic material, the narrative power of the best comic\r\ntales. And these isolated examples were of less importance for the\r\nactual history--being results of individual genius, which are not\r\nimitable--than certain more general characteristics of the two writers.\r\nBetween them--a little perhaps owing to their social position, but much\r\nmore by their pure literary quality--they reinstated the novel in the\r\nUpper House of literature itself. In Madame de Staël there was more than\r\nadequacy--in Chateaubriand there was sometimes consummateness--of style;\r\nin both, with whatever varnish of contemporary affectation, there was\r\ngenuine nobility of thought. They both chose subjects worthy of their\r\npowers, and Madame de Staël at least contented herself with ordinary, or\r\nnot very extraordinary, modern life. But the greatest things they did,\r\nfrom the historian's point of view, were introductions of the novel to\r\nnew fields of exercise and endeavour. Art and religion were brought into\r\nits sphere, and if _Les Natchez_ and _Les Martyrs_ cannot exactly be\r\ncalled modern historical novels, they are considerable advances, both\r\nupon the model of _Télémaque_ and upon that of _Bélisaire_. And even\r\nputting this aside, the whole body of Chateaubriand's work, as well as\r\nnot a little in Madame de Staël's, tended to introduce and to encourage\r\nthe spirit of Romance.\r\n\r\nNow the proposition which--though never, I trust, pushed to the\r\nunliterary extent of warping the judgment, and never yet, I hope, unduly\r\nflaunted or flourished in the reader's face--dominates this volume, is\r\nthat Romanticism, or, to use the shorter and more glorious name,\r\nRomance, itself dominates the whole of the French nineteenth-century\r\nnovel. If any one considers that this proposition is at variance with\r\nthe other, that the main function of the novel during the period has\r\nbeen to bring the novel closer to ordinary life, he has failed to grasp\r\nwhat it might be presumptuous plumply to call the true meaning of\r\nRomance, but what is certainly that meaning as it has always appeared to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nTo attempt discussion, or even enumeration, of all the definitions or\r\ndescriptions of Romance in general which have been given by others would\r\nnot only be impossible in the space at command, but would be really\r\nirrelevant. As it happens, the matter can be cut short, without\r\ninadequacy and without disingenuousness, by quoting a single pair of\r\nepithets, affixed by a critic, for whom I have great respect, a day or\r\ntwo before I wrote these words. This critic held that Romantic\r\ntreatment--in stage matters more particularly, but we can extend the\r\nphrase to fiction without unfairness--was \"generous but false.\" _I_\r\nshould call it \"generous\" certainly, but before all things \"true.\" Nor\r\nis this a mere play upon the words of the original. It so happens that\r\nour friend the enemy has supplied a most admirable help. Legally, as we\r\nknow, veracity requires \"the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth.\" I admit that the last clause will not fit Romance. She does give\r\nus something more than the truth, and that is her generosity, but it is\r\na generosity which is necessitated by the fact that Romance is a quality\r\nor function not so much of nature essentially--though happily it is\r\nsometimes so by accident--as of Art, the essence of which is to require,\r\nwhether it be art classic or art romantic, art of literature or art of\r\ndesign, art of sight or art of sound, something _added_ to the truth--as\r\nthat truth exists in reality.\r\n\r\nOf what this addition is presently. But Romance, as I see it, insists\r\nupon and gives the truth and the whole truth of nature itself. Who is\r\nthe greatest of Romantics? By agreement of all but the purblind and the\r\nparadoxer, Shakespeare. Who is the truest and the most universal of all\r\nwriters? By consent of classic and romantic, at least of those of either\r\nkind who \"count\"--again Shakespeare. Let me say at once that, having\r\nearly sworn allegiance to Logic, I am perfectly aware that a coincidence\r\nof two things in one person does not prove the identity of the things.\r\nBut it proves their compossibility, and when it is found _in excelsis_,\r\nit surely goes near to prove a good deal more. Nor is one in the least\r\nconfined to this argument from example, strong as it is. When you\r\nexamine Classicism, which, whatever we may say or not say of it, will\r\nalways stand as the opposite of Romance, you find that it always leaves\r\nsomething out. It may--it does in its best examples--give you truth; it\r\nmay--it does in its best examples--add something which is its own\r\n\"generosity\"--its castigation, its order, its reason, its this and that\r\nand the other. To be very liberal, it may be admitted that the perpetual\r\nand meticulous presence in it of \"Thou shalt not\" do or say this or\r\nthat, is most conspicuous--let us go to the extreme of generosity\r\nourselves and say, is only conspicuous--in its feebler examples. But\r\nthere is always something that it does not give, and some of us think\r\nthat there are not a few things which it cannot give. There is nothing,\r\nnot even ugliness itself, which Romance cannot give, though there its\r\nform of generosity comes in, and the ugly in simple essence becomes\r\nbeautiful by treatment.\r\n\r\nI could bestow any amount of tediousness in these generalities on my\r\nreaders if I thought it necessary: but having developed my proposition\r\nand its meaning, I think it better to pass to the applications thereof\r\nin the present subject.\r\n\r\nOf the wide extension of aim and object effected by Romantic influence\r\nin the novel, as in other departments of literature, there can be little\r\ndenial, though of course it may be contended that this extension took\r\nplace not as it ought and as it ought not. But of the fact of it and of\r\nthe corresponding variety introduced with it, the very pioneers of the\r\nso-called Romantic movement give ample proof. We have seen this even in\r\nthe extremely inchoate stage of the first two decades; when the great\r\ndefinitely Romantic leaders made their appearance it was more remarkable\r\nstill. The four chief writers who gave the Romantic lead before 1830\r\nitself may be taken to be Nodier, Hugo, Mérimée, and Vigny. They stand\r\nin choice of subjects, as in treatment of them, wide apart; and just as\r\nit has been noted of Vigny's poetry, that its three chief pieces,\r\n\"Éloa,\" \"Dolorida,\" and \"Le Cor\" point the way to three quite different\r\nkinds of Romantic verse, so, confining ourselves to the same example, it\r\nmay be repeated that _Cinq-Mars_ and the smaller stories exemplify, and\r\nin a way pattern, kinds of Romantic prose fiction even further apart\r\nfrom each other. Always, through the work of these and that of Gautier,\r\nand of all the others who immediately or subsequently follow them, this\r\nbroadening and branching out of the Romantic influence--this opening of\r\nfresh channels, historical and fanciful, supernatural and\r\nordinary--shows itself. The contention, common in books, that this\r\nsomehow ceased about the middle of the century, or at least died off\r\nwith the death of those who had carried it out, appears to me, I\r\nconfess, to be wildly unhistorical and uncritical. At no time--the\r\nproofs fill this volume--do we find any restriction, of choice of\r\nsubject or conduct of treatment, to anything like the older limits. But\r\nthe most unhistorical and the most uncritical form of this contention is\r\nthe astonishing endeavour to vindicate a \"classical\" character for\r\nNaturalism. Most certainly there is \"impropriety\" in some of the\r\nclassics and \"impropriety\" in all the Naturalists, but other resemblance\r\nI can see none. As for the argument that as Naturalism is opposed to\r\nRomance and Classicalism is opposed to Romance, _therefore_ Naturalism\r\nis Classical--this is undoubtedly a very common form of bastard\r\nsyllogism, but to labour at proving its bastardy would be somewhat\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, as should have been sufficiently made good above, that\r\nNaturalism is not opposed to Romance in anything like the sense that\r\nClassicism is: it is nothing but a degradation and exaggeration at once\r\nof certain things in Romance itself. Nor do I think that there is the\r\nslightest difficulty in showing that every form of novel-writing which\r\nwe have been surveying in this book--that the work of every one of those\r\ndistinguished or undistinguished writers who have been, with or without\r\nregret, declined--is still essentially Romantic. It is Romantic in its\r\ninflexible resolution to choose subjects for itself and not according to\r\nrule; Romantic in its wise or unwise individuality of treatment;\r\nRomantic in its preferential appeal to emotion rather than to pure\r\nintelligence; above all, Romantic in its quest--often no doubt\r\nill-guided and unsuccessful, but always more or less present--for that\r\nelement of strangeness which, though invisible to many who live, is a\r\npervading character of Life itself, and the presence of which it is the\r\nglory of Romance itself, from its earliest to its latest manifestations,\r\nto have recognised and to some extent fixed, in artistic representation.\r\nAnd so, I hope, that what has been discovered in this volume--in the way\r\nof pageant and procession even more than that of examination, though\r\nwith something of that also--may have shown further progress\r\ntowards--nay, actual attainment of, the goal which I ventured to mark\r\nout in the earlier volume as that of the novelist by the words, \"Here is\r\nthe whole of human life before you. Copy it or, better, re-create\r\nit--with variation and decoration _ad libitum_--as faithfully, but as\r\nfully, as you can.\"\r\n\r\nThesis-writing, however, is but dismal reading, unless (as Mrs. Scott\r\ntold Jeffrey she hoped he was for the _Marmion_ review) \"you are very\r\nwell paid for it.\" Nor do I, as I have previously explained, consider it\r\na necessary part of history, though common honesty may require that the\r\npresence of a doctrine, behind the delivery of an account, should be\r\nconfessed. I think the account itself should be sufficient to make good\r\nmy point; others may differ. But even if they do, some of them at least\r\nwill, I hope, have found in that account some modicum of the amazing\r\nsupply of rest and refreshment contained in the mass of literature we\r\nhave been surveying.\r\n\r\nOn the two volumes together there may be a little more to say. I have\r\ntouched, I hope not too frequently, on the curious pleasure which I\r\nmyself have felt in reading again books sometimes unopened for more than\r\nhalf a century, sometimes read at different times during that period,\r\nsometimes positively familiar; and on the contrasted enjoyment of\r\nreading others written long ago in all but a few cases, but not, as it\r\nhappened, read at the time of their appearance. I am indeed inclined to\r\nlay much stress on the quality of re-readableness in a novel. Perhaps,\r\nas indeed is pretty generally the fact in such cases, a capacity of\r\nreading again is required in the person as well as one of being read\r\nagain in the book. The late Mr. Mark Pattison was not a friend of mine,\r\nand we once had a pitched battle; nor was he in any case given to borrow\r\nother people's expressions. But he was a critic, if he was anything, and\r\nhe once did me the honour to repeat _verbatim_--whether consciously or\r\nnot I cannot say, but in the very periodical where it had originally\r\nappeared--a sentence of mine about \"people who would rather read any\r\ncirculating-library trash, for the first time, than _Pendennis_ or\r\n_Pride and Prejudice_ for the second.\" I think this difference between\r\nthe two classes is as worthy to rank, among the criteria of opposed\r\nraces of mankind and womankind, as those between borrowers and lenders,\r\nPlatonists and Aristotelians, or Big- and Little-Endians.\r\n\r\nBut the vast library through which I have had the privilege of\r\nconducting my readers does not exercise any invidious separation between\r\nthe two. I have read a good many French novels--hundreds certainly, I do\r\nnot know that it would be preposterous to say thousands--that I have not\r\neven mentioned in this book.[566] But I have been a very busy man, and\r\nhave had to read and to do a great many other things. If I had had\r\nnothing else to do and had devoted my entire life to the occupation\r\nwhich Gray thought not undesirable as regards Marivaux and Crébillon, I\r\ndoubt whether I could have \"overtaken,\" as the Scotch say, the entire\r\nprose fiction of 1800-1900 in French. On the back of one of the volumes\r\nof fiction--itself pretty obscure--which I have noticed in Chapter II.\r\nof this volume, I find advertised the works of a certain Dinocourt, of\r\nwhom I never heard before, and who is not to be found in at least some\r\ntolerably full French dictionaries of literature. They have quite\r\nappetising titles (one or two given in the passage referred to), and\r\nthere are in all sixty-two volumes of them, distributed in fours, fives,\r\nand sixes among the several works. Ought I to have read these sixty odd\r\nvolumes of Dinocourt? That is a moral question. That there _are_ sixty\r\nodd volumes of him, probably not now very easily obtainable, but\r\nsomewhere for some one to read if he likes, is a simple fact. And there\r\nare no doubt many more than sixty such batches waiting likewise,[567]\r\nand quite likely to prove as readable as I found M. Ricard.\r\n\r\nI have by no means always felt inclined to acquiesce in the endlessly\r\nrepeated complaints that the hackwork of literature is worse done in\r\nEngland than it is in France. But having had a very large experience of\r\nthe novels of both languages, having reviewed hundreds of English novels\r\nside by side with hundreds of French as they came from the press, and\r\nhaving also read, for pleasure or duty, hundreds of older ones in each\r\nliterature, I think that the mysterious quality of readableness pure and\r\nsimple _has_ more generally belonged to the French novel than to the\r\nEnglish. This, as I have endeavoured to point out, is not a question of\r\nnaughtiness or niceness, of candour or convention. I have indeed\r\nadmitted that the conventions of the French novel bore me quite as much\r\nas anything in ours. It _may_ be partly a question of length, for, as\r\neverybody knows, the French took to the average single volume, of some\r\nthree hundred not very closely printed pages, much sooner than we took\r\nto anything of the kind. It is perhaps partly also due to what one of\r\nthe reviewers of my former volume well called the greater \"spaciousness\"\r\nof the English novel, that is to say, its inclusion of more diverse\r\naims, and episodic subjects, and minor interests generally. For this,\r\nwhile it makes for superior greatness when there is strength enough to\r\ncarry it off, undoubtedly requires _more_ strength, and so gives more\r\nopenings for weakness to show itself. There are many average English\r\nnovels which I should not mind reading, and not a few that I should like\r\nto read, again, while there are but few French novels that I should care\r\nto read so often as I have cared to read the great English ones. But I\r\ncould read, for a second time, a very much larger proportion of average\r\nFrench fiction.\r\n\r\nOf those books which are \"above average\" I have tried to say what I\r\nthought ought to be said in the volume itself, and there is no need of a\r\n\"peroration with _much_ circumstance\" about them. It is a long way--a\r\nperfect maze of long ways leading through the most different countries\r\nof thought and feeling--from Atala dying in the wilderness to Chiffon\r\ndoing exquisitely balanced justice to herself and the Jesuit, by\r\nallowing that while he and she were both _bien élevés_, he was _un peu\r\ntrop_ and she was not. It is not so far, except in time, nor separated\r\nby such a difference of intervening country, from the song of the\r\nMandragore in Nodier to those muffled shrieks of a better-known variety\r\nof the same mystic plant, that tell us of Maupassant's growing progress\r\nto his fate. As you explore the time and the space of the interval you\r\ncome across wonderful things. There are the micro- macrocosms of Hugo,\r\nwhere, as in Baudelaire's line on the albatross quoted above, he is\r\npartly hampered because he has come down from the air of poetry to the\r\nearth of prose; of Balzac, where there is no such difficulty, but where\r\nthe cosmos itself is something other than yours; of Dumas, where half\r\nthe actual history of France is _dis_realised for your delectation. On a\r\nlesser scale you have the manners of town and country, of high life and\r\nlow life, of Paris most of all, given you through all sorts of\r\nperspectives and in all sorts of settings by Paul de Kock and George\r\nSand, by Sandeau and Bernard, by Alexandre Dumas _fils_ and Feuillet, by\r\nTheuriet and Fabre. Gautier and Mérimée make for you that marriage of\r\nstory and style which, before them, so few had attempted at all, yet\r\nwhich, since them, so many have tried with such doubtful success. Once\r\nmore in Flaubert and then for the last time, as far as our survey goes,\r\nin Maupassant, you come to that touch of genius which exalts the novel,\r\nas it exalts all kinds, indefinably, unmistakably, finally.\r\n\r\nAnd this journey is not like the one great journey, and more than one of\r\nthe lesser journeys, of our life, irremeable; there is no denial, no\r\ncurse, no fiend with outstretched claw, to prevent your going back as\r\noften as you like, wandering in any direction you please, passing or\r\nstaying as and where you wish. It has been perhaps unconscionable of me\r\nto inflict so big a book on my readers as a cover for giving myself the\r\npleasure of making and remaking such journeys. But if I have persuaded\r\nany one of them to explore the country for himself, by him at least I\r\nshall not remain unforgiven.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[558] _V. sup._ \"The French Novel in 1850.\"\r\n\r\n[559] Called by some a \"deadening\" one. There was some very cheerful\r\nLife in that Death.\r\n\r\n[560] The better part even of M. Ohnet is a sort of vulgarised Sandeau.\r\n\r\n[561] _La Tentation_, like others of the very greatest novels, is\r\nindependent of its time, save in mere unimportant \"colour.\"\r\n\r\n[562] How little this change was one back to classicism--as some would\r\nhave it--we may see presently.\r\n\r\n[563] The greatest of all--the direction and maintenance of the\r\nrevolution under the inspiration of what is called Romance--must be\r\nagain postponed for a little while.\r\n\r\n[564] Of course the convulsions of '48 were ominous enough, but they\r\nseemed to be everywhere repressed or placated for a considerable time;\r\nand if there had been a single statesman of genius besides Herr von\r\nBismarck (I anticipate but decline the suggestion of Cavour) in the\r\nEurope of the next two decades, they might not have broken out again for\r\na much longer time than was actually the case.\r\n\r\n[565] Nearly--but fortunately for literature--not quite. The jobbery and\r\nthe tyranny which are inseparable from democracy in politics find room\r\nwith difficulty in _our_ \"Republic.\"\r\n\r\n[566] I am prepared for blame on account of some of the absences of\r\nmention. Perhaps the most provoking, to some readers, will be those\r\naffecting two industrious members of the aristocracy: Mme. la Comtesse\r\nDash--more beautifully and properly though less exaltedly, Gabrelli Anna\r\nCisterne de Courtiras, _Vi_comtesse de Saint-Mars--and M. le Comte\r\nXavier de Montépin. They overlapped each other in pouring forth, from\r\nthe 'forties to the 'nineties, torrents of mostly sensational fiction.\r\nBut I had rather read them than write about them.\r\n\r\n[567] In the same place another novelist, M. Amédée de Bast, of whom I\r\nagain acknowledge ignorance, advertises no less than _four_ novels of\r\n_four_ volumes each, as being actually all at press, _pour paraître à\r\ndiverses époques_. Dryden says somewhere \"in epoches mistakes.\" Let us\r\nhope there were none here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nDATES OF PUBLICATION OF NOVELS ARRANGED UNDER AUTHOR'S NAMES IN THE\r\nORDER OF NOTICE HERE\r\n\r\n\r\n(_These dates are given subject to the caution stated under Addenda and\r\nCorrigenda for Vol. I., p. xvii of this present volume.
