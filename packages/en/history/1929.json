SHERIDAN, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Comments on the preparation of this E-Text:\r\n\r\nSQUARE BRACKETS:\r\n\r\nThe square brackets, i.e. [ ] are copied from the printed book, without\r\nchange, except that a closing bracket \"]\" has been added to the stage\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\nFor this E-Text version of the book, the footnotes have been\r\nconsolidated at the end of the play.\r\n\r\nNumbering of the footnotes has been changed, and each footnote is given\r\na unique identity in the form <X>.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES TO THE TEXT:\r\n\r\nCharacter names have been expanded. For Example, SIR BENJAMIN was SIR\r\nBEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEXT OF THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL\r\n\r\nThe text of THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL in this edition is taken, by Mr.\r\nFraser Rae's generous permission, from his SHERIDAN'S PLAYS NOW PRINTED\r\nAS HE WROTE THEM. In his Prefatory Notes (xxxvii), Mr. Rae writes: \"The\r\nmanuscript of it [THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL] in Sheridan's own handwriting\r\nis preserved at Frampton Court and is now printed in this volume. This\r\nversion differs in many respects from that which is generally known,\r\nand I think it is even better than that which has hitherto been read and\r\nacted. As I have endeavoured to reproduce the works of Sheridan as he\r\nwrote them, I may be told that he was a bad hand at punctuating and very\r\nbad at spelling. . . . But Sheridan's shortcomings as a speller have\r\nbeen exaggerated.\" Lest \"Sheridan's shortcomings\" either in spelling\r\nor in punctuation should obscure the text, I have, in this edition,\r\ninserted in brackets some explanatory suggestions. It has seemed best,\r\nalso, to adopt a uniform method for indicating stage-directions and\r\nabbreviations of the names of characters. There can be no gain to the\r\nreader in reproducing, for example, Sheridan's different indications for\r\nthe part of Lady Sneerwell--LADY SNEERWELL, LADY SNEER., LADY SN., and\r\nLADY S.--or his varying use of EXIT and EX., or his inconsistencies in\r\nthe use of italics in the stage-directions. Since, however, Sheridan's\r\nbiographers, from Moore to Fraser Rae, have shown that no authorised or\r\ncorrect edition of THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL was published in Sheridan's\r\nlifetime, there seems unusual justification for reproducing the text of\r\nthe play itself with absolute fidelity to the original manuscript. Mr.\r\nRidgway, who repeatedly sought to obtain a copy corrected by the author,\r\naccording to Moore's account (LIFE OF SHERIDAN, I. p. 260), \"was told\r\nby Mr. Sheridan, as an excuse for keeping it back, that he had been\r\nnineteen years endeavouring to satisfy himself with the style of The\r\nSchool for Scandal, but had not yet succeeded.\" Mr. Rae (SHERIDAN, I. p.\r\n332) recorded his discovery of the manuscript of \"two acts of The School\r\nfor Scandal prepared by Sheridan for publication,\" and hoped, before his\r\ndeath, to publish this partial revision. Numberless unauthorized changes\r\nin the play have been made for histrionic purposes, from the first\r\nundated Dublin edition to that of Mr. Augustin Daly. Current texts may\r\nusually be traced, directly or indirectly, to the two-volume Murray\r\nedition of Sheridan's plays, in 1821. Some of the changes from the\r\noriginal manuscript, such as the blending of the parts of Miss Verjuice\r\nand Snake, are doubtless effective for reasons of dramatic economy, but\r\nmany of the \"cuts\" are to be regretted from the reader's standpoint. The\r\nstudent of English drama will prefer Sheridan's own text to editorial\r\nemendations, however clever or effective for dramatic ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESSED TO MRS. CREWE,\r\n\r\nWITH THE COMEDY OF THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL\r\n\r\n     Tell me, ye prim adepts in Scandal's school,\r\n     Who rail by precept, and detract by rule,\r\n     Lives there no character, so tried, so known,\r\n     So deck'd with grace, and so unlike your own,\r\n     That even you assist her fame to raise,\r\n     Approve by envy, and by silence praise!--\r\n     Attend!--a model shall attract your view--\r\n     Daughters of calumny, I summon you!\r\n     You shall decide if this a portrait prove,\r\n     Or fond creation of the Muse and Love.--\r\n     Attend, ye virgin critics, shrewd and sage,\r\n     Ye matron censors of this childish age,\r\n     Whose peering eye and wrinkled front declare\r\n     A fixt antipathy to young and fair;\r\n     By cunning, cautious; or by nature, cold,\r\n     In maiden madness, virulently bold!--\r\n     Attend! ye skilled to coin the precious tale,\r\n     Creating proof, where innuendos fail!\r\n     Whose practised memories, cruelly exact,\r\n     Omit no circumstance, except the fact!--\r\n     Attend, all ye who boast,--or old or young,--\r\n     The living libel of a slanderous tongue!\r\n     So shall my theme as far contrasted be,\r\n     As saints by fiends, or hymns by calumny.\r\n     Come, gentle Amoret (for 'neath that name,\r\n     In worthier verse is sung thy beauty's fame);\r\n     Come--for but thee who seeks the Muse? and while\r\n     Celestial blushes check thy conscious smile,\r\n     With timid grace, and hesitating eye,\r\n     The perfect model, which I boast, supply:--\r\n     Vain Muse! couldst thou the humblest sketch create\r\n     Of her, or slightest charm couldst imitate--\r\n     Could thy blest strain in kindred colours trace\r\n     The faintest wonder of her form and face--\r\n     Poets would study the immortal line,\r\n     And REYNOLDS own HIS art subdued by thine;\r\n     That art, which well might added lustre give\r\n     To Nature's best and Heaven's superlative:\r\n     On GRANBY'S cheek might bid new glories rise,\r\n     Or point a purer beam from DEVON'S eyes!\r\n     Hard is the task to shape that beauty's praise,\r\n     Whose judgment scorns the homage flattery pays!\r\n     But praising Amoret we cannot err,\r\n     No tongue o'ervalues Heaven, or flatters her!\r\n     Yet she, by Fate's perverseness--she alone\r\n     Would doubt our truth, nor deem such praise her own!\r\n     Adorning Fashion, unadorn'd by dress,\r\n     Simple from taste, and not from carelessness;\r\n     Discreet in gesture, in deportment mild,\r\n     Not stiff with prudence, nor uncouthly wild:\r\n     No state has AMORET! no studied mien;\r\n     She frowns no GODDESS, and she moves no QUEEN.\r\n     The softer charm that in her manner lies\r\n     Is framed to captivate, yet not surprise;\r\n     It justly suits th' expression of her face,--\r\n     'Tis less than dignity, and more than grace!\r\n     On her pure cheek the native hue is such,\r\n     That, form'd by Heav'n to be admired so much,\r\n     The hand divine, with a less partial care,\r\n     Might well have fix'd a fainter crimson there,\r\n     And bade the gentle inmate of her breast,--\r\n     Inshrined Modesty!--supply the rest.\r\n     But who the peril of her lips shall paint?\r\n     Strip them of smiles--still, still all words are faint!\r\n     But moving Love himself appears to teach\r\n     Their action, though denied to rule her speech;\r\n     And thou who seest her speak and dost not hear,\r\n     Mourn not her distant accents 'scape thine ear;\r\n     Viewing those lips, thou still may'st make pretence\r\n     To judge of what she says, and swear 'tis sense:\r\n     Cloth'd with such grace, with such expression fraught,\r\n     They move in meaning, and they pause in thought!\r\n     But dost thou farther watch, with charm'd surprise,\r\n     The mild irresolution of her eyes,\r\n     Curious to mark how frequent they repose,\r\n     In brief eclipse and momentary close--\r\n     Ah! seest thou not an ambush'd Cupid there,\r\n     Too tim'rous of his charge, with jealous care\r\n     Veils and unveils those beams of heav'nly light,\r\n     Too full, too fatal else, for mortal sight?\r\n     Nor yet, such pleasing vengeance fond to meet,\r\n     In pard'ning dimples hope a safe retreat.\r\n     What though her peaceful breast should ne'er allow\r\n     Subduing frowns to arm her altered brow,\r\n     By Love, I swear, and by his gentle wiles,\r\n     More fatal still the mercy of her smiles!\r\n     Thus lovely, thus adorn'd, possessing all\r\n     Of bright or fair that can to woman fall,\r\n     The height of vanity might well be thought\r\n     Prerogative in her, and Nature's fault.\r\n     Yet gentle AMORET, in mind supreme\r\n     As well as charms, rejects the vainer theme;\r\n     And, half mistrustful of her beauty's store,\r\n     She barbs with wit those darts too keen before:--\r\n     Read in all knowledge that her sex should reach,\r\n     Though GREVILLE, or the MUSE, should deign to teach,\r\n     Fond to improve, nor tim'rous to discern\r\n     How far it is a woman's grace to learn;\r\n     In MILLAR'S dialect she would not prove\r\n     Apollo's priestess, but Apollo's love,\r\n     Graced by those signs which truth delights to own,\r\n     The timid blush, and mild submitted tone:\r\n     Whate'er she says, though sense appear throughout,\r\n     Displays the tender hue of female doubt;\r\n     Deck'd with that charm, how lovely wit appears,\r\n     How graceful SCIENCE, when that robe she wears!\r\n     Such too her talents, and her bent of mind,\r\n     As speak a sprightly heart by thought refined:\r\n     A taste for mirth, by contemplation school'd,\r\n     A turn for ridicule, by candour ruled,\r\n     A scorn of folly, which she tries to hide;\r\n     An awe of talent, which she owns with pride!\r\n       Peace, idle Muse! no more thy strain prolong,\r\n     But yield a theme thy warmest praises wrong;\r\n     Just to her merit, though thou canst not raise\r\n     Thy feeble verse, behold th' acknowledged praise\r\n     Has spread conviction through the envious train,\r\n     And cast a fatal gloom o'er Scandal's reign!\r\n     And lo! each pallid hag, with blister'd tongue,\r\n     Mutters assent to all thy zeal has sung--\r\n     Owns all the colours just--the outline true;\r\n     Thee my inspirer, and my MODEL--CREWE!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     DRAMATIS PERSONAE<2>\r\n\r\n     SIR PETER TEAZLE      Mr. King\r\n     SIR OLIVER SURFACE    Mr. Yates\r\n     YOUNG SURFACE         Mr. Palmer\r\n     CHARLES (his Brother) Mr. Smith\r\n     CRABTREE              Mr. Parsons\r\n     SIR BENJAMIN BACKBITE Mr. Dodd\r\n     ROWLEY                Mr. Aikin\r\n     SPUNGE\r\n     MOSES\r\n     SNAKE\r\n     CARELESS--and other companions to CHARLES\r\n\r\n     LADY TEAZLE\r\n     MARIA\r\n     LADY SNEERWELL\r\n     MRS.

GARRICK\r\n\r\n     A school for Scandal! tell me, I beseech you,\r\n     Needs there a school this modish art to teach you?\r\n     No need of lessons now, the knowing think;\r\n     We might as well be taught to eat and drink.\r\n     Caused by a dearth of scandal, should the vapours\r\n     Distress our fair ones--let them read the papers;\r\n     Their powerful mixtures such disorders hit;\r\n     Crave what you will--there's quantum sufficit.\r\n     \"Lord!\" cries my Lady Wormwood (who loves tattle,\r\n     And puts much salt and pepper in her prattle),\r\n     Just risen at noon, all night at cards when threshing\r\n     Strong tea and scandal--\"Bless me, how refreshing!\r\n     Give me the papers, Lisp--how bold and free!

The Paragraphs you say were all inserted:\r\n\r\nVERJUICE. They were Madam--and as I copied them myself in a feigned Hand\r\nthere can be no suspicion whence they came.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Did you circulate the Report of Lady Brittle's Intrigue\r\nwith Captain Boastall?\r\n\r\nVERJUICE. Madam by this Time Lady Brittle is the Talk of half the\r\nTown--and I doubt not in a week the Men will toast her as a Demirep.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. What have you done as to the insinuation as to a certain\r\nBaronet's Lady and a certain Cook.\r\n\r\nVERJUICE. That is in as fine a Train as your Ladyship could wish. I told\r\nthe story yesterday to my own maid with directions to communicate it\r\ndirectly to my Hairdresser. He I am informed has a Brother who courts a\r\nMilliners' Prentice in Pallmall whose mistress has a first cousin whose\r\nsister is Feme [Femme] de Chambre to Mrs. Clackit--so that in the\r\ncommon course of Things it must reach Mrs. Clackit's Ears within\r\nfour-and-twenty hours and then you know the Business is as good as done.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Why truly Mrs. Clackit has a very pretty Talent--a great\r\ndeal of industry--yet--yes--been tolerably successful in her way--To my\r\nknowledge she has been the cause of breaking off six matches[,] of three\r\nsons being disinherited and four Daughters being turned out of Doors.\r\nOf three several Elopements, as many close confinements--nine separate\r\nmaintenances and two Divorces.--nay I have more than once traced her\r\ncausing a Tete-a-Tete in the Town and Country Magazine--when the Parties\r\nperhaps had never seen each other's Faces before in the course of their\r\nLives.\r\n\r\nVERJUICE. She certainly has Talents.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. But her manner is gross.\r\n\r\nVERJUICE. 'Tis very true. She generally designs well[,] has a free\r\ntongue and a bold invention--but her colouring is too dark and her\r\noutline often extravagant--She wants that delicacy of Tint--and\r\nmellowness of sneer--which distinguish your Ladyship's Scandal.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Ah you are Partial Verjuice.\r\n\r\nVERJUICE. Not in the least--everybody allows that Lady Sneerwell can do\r\nmore with a word or a Look than many can with the most laboured Detail\r\neven when they happen to have a little truth on their side to support\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Yes my dear Verjuice. I am no Hypocrite to deny the\r\nsatisfaction I reap from the Success of my Efforts. Wounded myself, in\r\nthe early part of my Life by the envenomed Tongue of Slander I confess\r\nI have since known no Pleasure equal to the reducing others to the Level\r\nof my own injured Reputation.\r\n\r\nVERJUICE. Nothing can be more natural--But my dear Lady Sneerwell There\r\nis one affair in which you have lately employed me, wherein, I confess I\r\nam at a Loss to guess your motives.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. I conceive you mean with respect to my neighbour, Sir\r\nPeter Teazle, and his Family--Lappet.--And has my conduct in this matter\r\nreally appeared to you so mysterious?\r\n\r\n     [Exit MAID.]\r\n\r\nVERJUICE. Entirely so.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. [VERJUICE.?] An old Batchelor as Sir Peter was[,] having\r\ntaken a young wife from out of the Country--as Lady Teazle is--are\r\ncertainly fair subjects for a little mischievous raillery--but here are\r\ntwo young men--to whom Sir Peter has acted as a kind of Guardian since\r\ntheir Father's death, the eldest possessing the most amiable Character\r\nand universally well spoken of[,] the youngest the most dissipated\r\nand extravagant young Fellow in the Kingdom, without Friends or\r\ncaracter--the former one an avowed admirer of yours and apparently\r\nyour Favourite[,] the latter attached to Maria Sir Peter's ward--and\r\nconfessedly beloved by her. Now on the face of these circumstances it\r\nis utterly unaccountable to me why you a young Widow with no great\r\njointure--should not close with the passion of a man of such character\r\nand expectations as Mr. Surface--and more so why you should be so\r\nuncommonly earnest to destroy the mutual Attachment subsisting between\r\nhis Brother Charles and Maria.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Then at once to unravel this mistery--I must inform you\r\nthat Love has no share whatever in the intercourse between Mr. Surface\r\nand me.\r\n\r\nVERJUICE. No!\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. His real attachment is to Maria or her Fortune--but\r\nfinding in his Brother a favoured Rival, He has been obliged to mask his\r\nPretensions--and profit by my Assistance.\r\n\r\nVERJUICE. Yet still I am more puzzled why you should interest yourself\r\nin his success.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Heavens! how dull you are! cannot you surmise the\r\nweakness which I hitherto, thro' shame have concealed even from\r\nyou--must I confess that Charles--that Libertine, that extravagant, that\r\nBankrupt in Fortune and Reputation--that He it is for whom I am thus\r\nanxious and malicious and to gain whom I would sacrifice--everything----\r\n\r\nVERJUICE. Now indeed--your conduct appears consistent and I no longer\r\nwonder at your enmity to Maria, but how came you and Surface so\r\nconfidential?\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. For our mutual interest--but I have found out him a long\r\ntime since[,] altho' He has contrived to deceive everybody beside--I\r\nknow him to be artful selfish and malicious--while with Sir Peter, and\r\nindeed with all his acquaintance, He passes for a youthful Miracle of\r\nPrudence--good sense and Benevolence.\r\n\r\nVERJUICE. Yes yes--I know Sir Peter vows He has not his equal in\r\nEngland; and, above all, He praises him as a MAN OF SENTIMENT.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. True and with the assistance of his sentiments and\r\nhypocrisy he has brought Sir Peter entirely in his interests with\r\nrespect to Maria and is now I believe attempting to flatter Lady Teazle\r\ninto the same good opinion towards him--while poor Charles has no Friend\r\nin the House--though I fear he has a powerful one in Maria's Heart,\r\nagainst whom we must direct our schemes.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Mr. Surface.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Shew him up. He generally calls about this Time. I don't\r\nwonder at People's giving him to me for a Lover.\r\n\r\n     Enter SURFACE\r\n\r\nSURFACE. My dear Lady Sneerwell, how do you do to-day--your most\r\nobedient.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Miss Verjuice has just been arraigning me on our mutual\r\nattachment now; but I have informed her of our real views and the\r\nPurposes for which our Geniuses at present co-operate. You know\r\nhow useful she has been to us--and believe me the confidence is not\r\nill-placed.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Madam, it is impossible for me to suspect that a Lady of Miss\r\nVerjuice's sensibility and discernment----\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Well--well--no compliments now--but tell me when you saw\r\nyour mistress or what is more material to me your Brother.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. I have not seen either since I saw you--but I can inform you\r\nthat they are at present at Variance--some of your stories have taken\r\ngood effect on Maria.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Ah! my dear Verjuice the merit of this belongs to you.\r\nBut do your Brother's Distresses encrease?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Every hour. I am told He had another execution in his house\r\nyesterday--in short his Dissipation and extravagance exceed anything I\r\nhave ever heard of.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Poor Charles!\r\n\r\nSURFACE. True Madam--notwithstanding his Vices one can't help feeling\r\nfor him--ah poor Charles! I'm sure I wish it was in my Power to be of\r\nany essential Service to him--for the man who does not share in\r\nthe Distresses of a Brother--even though merited by his own\r\nmisconduct--deserves----\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. O Lud you are going to be moral, and forget that you are\r\namong Friends.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Egad, that's true--I'll keep that sentiment till I see Sir\r\nPeter. However it is certainly a charity to rescue Maria from such a\r\nLibertine who--if He is to be reclaim'd, can be so only by a Person of\r\nyour Ladyship's superior accomplishments and understanding.\r\n\r\nVERJUICE. 'Twould be a Hazardous experiment.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. But--Madam--let me caution you to place no more confidence in\r\nour Friend Snake the Libeller--I have lately detected him in frequent\r\nconference with old Rowland [Rowley] who was formerly my Father's\r\nSteward and has never been a friend of mine.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. I'm not disappointed in Snake, I never suspected the\r\nfellow to have virtue enough to be faithful even to his own Villany.\r\n\r\n     Enter MARIA\r\n\r\nMaria my dear--how do you do--what's the matter?\r\n\r\nMARIA. O here is that disagreeable lover of mine, Sir Benjamin Backbite,\r\nhas just call'd at my guardian's with his odious Uncle Crabtree--so I\r\nslipt out and ran hither to avoid them.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Is that all?\r\n\r\nVERJUICE. Lady Sneerwell--I'll go and write the Letter I mention'd to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. If my Brother Charles had been of the Party, madam, perhaps you\r\nwould not have been so much alarmed.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Nay now--you are severe for I dare swear the Truth\r\nof the matter is Maria heard YOU were here--but my dear--what has Sir\r\nBenjamin done that you should avoid him so----\r\n\r\nMARIA. Oh He has done nothing--but his conversation is a perpetual Libel\r\non all his Acquaintance.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Aye and the worst of it is there is no advantage in not knowing\r\nThem, for He'll abuse a stranger just as soon as his best Friend--and\r\nCrabtree is as bad.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Nay but we should make allowance[--]Sir Benjamin is a\r\nwit and a poet.\r\n\r\nMARIA. For my Part--I own madam--wit loses its respect with me, when I\r\nsee it in company with malice.--What do you think, Mr. Surface?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Certainly, Madam, to smile at the jest which plants a Thorn on\r\nanother's Breast is to become a principal in the mischief.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Pshaw--there's no possibility of being witty without a\r\nlittle [ill] nature--the malice of a good thing is the Barb that makes\r\nit stick.--What's your opinion, Mr. Surface?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Certainly madam--that conversation where the Spirit of Raillery\r\nis suppressed will ever appear tedious and insipid--\r\n\r\nMARIA. Well I'll not debate how far Scandal may be allowable--but in a\r\nman I am sure it is always contemtable.--We have Pride, envy, Rivalship,\r\nand a Thousand motives to depreciate each other--but the male-slanderer\r\nmust have the cowardice of a woman before He can traduce one.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. I wish my Cousin Verjuice hadn't left us--she should\r\nembrace you.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Ah! she's an old maid and is privileged of course.\r\n\r\n     Enter SERVANT\r\n\r\nMadam Mrs. Candour is below and if your Ladyship's at leisure will leave\r\nher carriage.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Beg her to walk in. Now, Maria[,] however here is a\r\nCharacter to your Taste, for tho' Mrs. Candour is a little talkative\r\neverybody allows her to be the best-natured and best sort of woman.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Yes with a very gross affectation of good Nature and\r\nBenevolence--she does more mischief than the Direct malice of old\r\nCrabtree.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Efaith 'tis very true Lady Sneerwell--Whenever I hear the\r\ncurrent running again the characters of my Friends, I never think them\r\nin such Danger as when Candour undertakes their Defence.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Hush here she is----\r\n\r\n     Enter MRS. CANDOUR\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. My dear Lady Sneerwell how have you been this Century.\r\nI have never seen you tho' I have heard of you very often.--Mr.\r\nSurface--the World says scandalous things of you--but indeed it is\r\nno matter what the world says, for I think one hears nothing else but\r\nscandal.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Just so, indeed, Ma'am.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Ah Maria Child--what[!] is the whole affair off between\r\nyou and Charles? His extravagance; I presume--The Town talks of nothing\r\nelse----\r\n\r\nMARIA. I am very sorry, Ma'am, the Town has so little to do.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. True, true, Child; but there's no stopping people's\r\nTongues. I own I was hurt to hear it--as I indeed was to learn from the\r\nsame quarter that your guardian, Sir Peter[,] and Lady Teazle have not\r\nagreed lately so well as could be wish'd.\r\n\r\nMARIA. 'Tis strangely impertinent for people to busy themselves so.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Very true, Child; but what's to be done? People will\r\ntalk--there's no preventing it.--why it was but yesterday I was told\r\nthat Miss Gadabout had eloped with Sir Filagree Flirt. But, Lord! there\r\nis no minding what one hears; tho' to be sure I had this from very good\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Such reports are highly scandalous.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. So they are Child--shameful! shameful! but the world is\r\nso censorious no character escapes. Lord, now! who would have suspected\r\nyour friend, Miss Prim, of an indiscretion Yet such is the ill-nature\r\nof people, that they say her unkle stopped her last week just as she was\r\nstepping into a Postchaise with her Dancing-master.\r\n\r\nMARIA. I'll answer for't there are no grounds for the Report.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Oh, no foundation in the world I dare swear[;] no more\r\nprobably than for the story circulated last month, of Mrs. Festino's\r\naffair with Colonel Cassino--tho' to be sure that matter was never\r\nrightly clear'd up.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. The license of invention some people take is monstrous indeed.\r\n\r\nMARIA. 'Tis so but in my opinion, those who report such things are\r\nequally culpable.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. To be sure they are[;] Tale Bearers are as bad as the Tale\r\nmakers--'tis an old observation and a very true one--but what's to be\r\ndone as I said before--how will you prevent People from talking--to-day,\r\nMrs. Clackitt assured me, Mr. and Mrs. Honeymoon were at last become\r\nmere man and wife--like [the rest of their] acquaintance--she likewise\r\nhinted that a certain widow in the next street had got rid of her Dropsy\r\nand recovered her shape in a most surprising manner--at the same [time]\r\nMiss Tattle, who was by affirm'd, that Lord Boffalo had discover'd his\r\nLady at a house of no extraordinary Fame--and that Sir Harry Bouquet and\r\nTom Saunter were to measure swords on a similar Provocation. But--Lord!\r\ndo you think I would report these Things--No, no[!] Tale Bearers as I\r\nsaid before are just as bad as the talemakers.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Ah! Mrs. Candour, if everybody had your Forbearance and good\r\nnature--\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. I confess Mr. Surface I cannot bear to hear People\r\ntraduced behind their Backs[;] and when ugly circumstances come out\r\nagainst our acquaintances I own I always love to think the best--by the\r\nbye I hope 'tis not true that your Brother is absolutely ruin'd--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. I am afraid his circumstances are very bad indeed, Ma'am--\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Ah! I heard so--but you must tell him to keep up his\r\nSpirits--everybody almost is in the same way--Lord Spindle, Sir Thomas\r\nSplint, Captain Quinze, and Mr. Nickit--all up, I hear, within this\r\nweek; so, if Charles is undone, He'll find half his Acquaintance ruin'd\r\ntoo, and that, you know, is a consolation--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Doubtless, Ma'am--a very great one.\r\n\r\n     Enter SERVANT\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Mr. Crabtree and Sir Benjamin Backbite.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Soh! Maria, you see your lover pursues you--Positively\r\nyou shan't escape.\r\n\r\n     Enter CRABTREE and SIR BENJAMIN BACKBITE\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Lady Sneerwell, I kiss your hand. Mrs. Candour I don't believe\r\nyou are acquainted with my Nephew Sir Benjamin Backbite--Egad, Ma'am, He\r\nhas a pretty wit--and is a pretty Poet too isn't He Lady Sneerwell?\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. O fie, Uncle!\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Nay egad it's true--I back him at a Rebus or a Charade against\r\nthe best Rhymer in the Kingdom--has your Ladyship heard the Epigram he\r\nwrote last week on Lady Frizzle's Feather catching Fire--Do Benjamin\r\nrepeat it--or the Charade you made last Night extempore at Mrs.\r\nDrowzie's conversazione--Come now your first is the Name of a Fish, your\r\nsecond a great naval commander--and\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Dear Uncle--now--prithee----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Efaith, Ma'am--'twould surprise you to hear how ready he is at\r\nall these Things.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. I wonder Sir Benjamin you never publish anything.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. To say truth, Ma'am, 'tis very vulgar to Print and as my\r\nlittle Productions are mostly Satires and Lampoons I find they\r\ncirculate more by giving copies in confidence to the Friends of the\r\nParties--however I have some love-Elegies, which, when favoured with\r\nthis lady's smile I mean to give to the Public.\r\n\r\n[Pointing to MARIA.]\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. 'Fore Heaven, ma'am, they'll immortalize you--you'll be handed\r\ndown to Posterity, like Petrarch's Laura, or Waller's Sacharissa.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Yes Madam I think you will like them--when you shall see\r\nin a beautiful Quarto Page how a neat rivulet of Text shall meander\r\nthro' a meadow of margin--'fore Gad, they will be the most elegant\r\nThings of their kind--\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. But Ladies, have you heard the news?\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. What, Sir, do you mean the Report of----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. No ma'am that's not it.--Miss Nicely is going to be married to\r\nher own Footman.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Impossible!\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Ask Sir Benjamin.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. 'Tis very true, Ma'am--everything is fixed and the wedding\r\nLivery bespoke.\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Yes and they say there were pressing reasons for't.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. It cannot be--and I wonder any one should believe such a\r\nstory of so prudent a Lady as Miss Nicely.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. O Lud! ma'am, that's the very reason 'twas believed at\r\nonce. She has always been so cautious and so reserved, that everybody\r\nwas sure there was some reason for it at bottom.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Yes a Tale of Scandal is as fatal to the Reputation of\r\na prudent Lady of her stamp as a Fever is generally to those of the\r\nstrongest Constitutions, but there is a sort of puny sickly Reputation,\r\nthat is always ailing yet will outlive the robuster characters of a\r\nhundred Prudes.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. True Madam there are Valetudinarians in Reputation as well\r\nas constitution--who being conscious of their weak Part, avoid the\r\nleast breath of air, and supply their want of Stamina by care and\r\ncircumspection--\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Well but this may be all mistake--You know, Sir Benjamin\r\nvery trifling circumstances often give rise to the most injurious Tales.\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. That they do I'll be sworn Ma'am--did you ever hear how\r\nMiss Shepherd came to lose her Lover and her Character last summer at\r\nTunbridge--Sir Benjamin you remember it--\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. O to be sure the most whimsical circumstance--\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. How was it Pray--\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Why one evening at Mrs. Ponto's Assembly--the conversation\r\nhappened to turn on the difficulty of breeding Nova-Scotia Sheep in\r\nthis country--says a young Lady in company[, \"]I have known instances\r\nof it[--]for Miss Letitia Shepherd, a first cousin of mine, had a\r\nNova-Scotia Sheep that produced her Twins.[\"--\"]What![\"] cries the old\r\nDowager Lady Dundizzy (who you know is as deaf as a Post), [\"]has Miss\r\nLetitia Shepherd had twins[\"]--This Mistake--as you may imagine, threw\r\nthe whole company into a fit of Laughing--However 'twas the next morning\r\neverywhere reported and in a few Days believed by the whole Town, that\r\nMiss Letitia Shepherd had actually been brought to Bed of a fine Boy\r\nand Girl--and in less than a week there were People who could name the\r\nFather, and the Farm House where the Babies were put out to Nurse.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Strange indeed!\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Matter of Fact, I assure you--O Lud! Mr. Surface pray is it\r\ntrue that your uncle Sir Oliver is coming home--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Not that I know of indeed Sir.\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. He has been in the East Indies a long time--you can scarcely\r\nremember him--I believe--sad comfort on his arrival to hear how your\r\nBrother has gone on!\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Charles has been imprudent Sir to be sure[;] but I hope no Busy\r\npeople have already prejudiced Sir Oliver against him--He may reform--\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. To be sure He may--for my Part I never believed him to be\r\nso utterly void of Principle as People say--and tho' he has lost all his\r\nFriends I am told nobody is better spoken of--by the Jews.\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. That's true egad nephew--if the Old Jewry was a Ward I believe\r\nCharles would be an alderman--no man more popular there, 'fore Gad I\r\nhear He pays as many annuities as the Irish Tontine and that whenever\r\nHe's sick they have Prayers for the recovery of his Health in the\r\nsynagogue--\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Yet no man lives in greater Splendour:--they tell me when\r\nHe entertains his Friends--He can sit down to dinner with a dozen of his\r\nown Securities, have a score Tradesmen waiting in the Anti-Chamber, and\r\nan officer behind every guest's Chair.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. This may be entertainment to you Gentlemen but you pay very\r\nlittle regard to the Feelings of a Brother.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Their malice is intolerable--Lady Sneerwell I must wish you a\r\ngood morning--I'm not very well.\r\n\r\n     [Exit MARIA.]\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. O dear she chang'd colour very much!\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Do Mrs. Candour follow her--she may want assistance.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. That I will with all my soul ma'am.--Poor dear Girl--who\r\nknows--what her situation may be!\r\n\r\n     [Exit MRS. CANDOUR.]\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. 'Twas nothing but that she could not bear to hear\r\nCharles reflected on notwithstanding their difference.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. The young Lady's Penchant is obvious.\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. But Benjamin--you mustn't give up the Pursuit for that--follow\r\nher and put her into good humour--repeat her some of your verses--come,\r\nI'll assist you--\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Mr. Surface I did not mean to hurt you--but depend on't\r\nyour Brother is utterly undone--\r\n\r\n     [Going.]\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. O Lud! aye--undone--as ever man was--can't raise a guinea.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. And everything sold--I'm told--that was movable--\r\n\r\n     [Going.]\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. I was at his house--not a thing left but some empty Bottles\r\nthat were overlooked and the Family Pictures, which I believe are framed\r\nin the Wainscot.\r\n\r\n     [Going.]\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. And I'm very sorry to hear also some bad stories against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n     [Going.]\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. O He has done many mean things--that's certain!\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. But however as He is your Brother----\r\n\r\n     [Going.]\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. We'll tell you all another opportunity.\r\n\r\n     [Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Ha! ha! ha! 'tis very hard for them to leave a subject\r\nthey have not quite run down.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. And I believe the Abuse was no more acceptable to your Ladyship\r\nthan Maria.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. I doubt her Affections are farther engaged than we\r\nimagin'd but the Family are to be here this Evening so you may as\r\nwell dine where you are and we shall have an opportunity of observing\r\nfarther--in the meantime, I'll go and plot Mischief and you shall study\r\nSentiments.\r\n\r\n     [Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.--SIR PETER'S House\r\n\r\n     Enter SIR PETER\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. When an old Bachelor takes a young Wife--what is He to\r\nexpect--'Tis now six months since Lady Teazle made me the happiest\r\nof men--and I have been the most miserable Dog ever since that ever\r\ncommitted wedlock. We tift a little going to church--and came to a\r\nQuarrel before the Bells had done ringing--I was more than once nearly\r\nchok'd with gall during the Honeymoon--and had lost all comfort in Life\r\nbefore my Friends had done wishing me Joy--yet I chose with caution--a\r\ngirl bred wholly in the country--who never knew luxury beyond one silk\r\ngown--nor dissipation above the annual Gala of a Race-Ball--Yet she now\r\nplays her Part in all the extravagant Fopperies of the Fashion and the\r\nTown, with as ready a Grace as if she had never seen a Bush nor a\r\ngrass Plot out of Grosvenor-Square! I am sneered at by my old\r\nacquaintance--paragraphed--in the news Papers--She dissipates my\r\nFortune, and contradicts all my Humours--yet the worst of it is I doubt\r\nI love her or I should never bear all this. However I'll never be weak\r\nenough to own it.\r\n\r\n     Enter ROWLEY\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Sir Peter, your servant:--how is 't with you Sir--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Very bad--Master Rowley--very bad[.] I meet with nothing but\r\ncrosses and vexations--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. What can have happened to trouble you since yesterday?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. A good--question to a married man--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Nay I'm sure your Lady Sir Peter can't be the cause of your\r\nuneasiness.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Why has anybody told you she was dead[?]\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Come, come, Sir Peter, you love her, notwithstanding your\r\ntempers do not exactly agree.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. But the Fault is entirely hers, Master Rowley--I am myself,\r\nthe sweetest temper'd man alive, and hate a teasing temper; and so I\r\ntell her a hundred Times a day--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Indeed!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Aye and what is very extraordinary in all our disputes she\r\nis always in the wrong! But Lady Sneerwell, and the Set she meets at her\r\nHouse, encourage the perverseness of her Disposition--then to complete\r\nmy vexations--Maria--my Ward--whom I ought to have the Power of a Father\r\nover, is determined to turn Rebel too and absolutely refuses the man\r\nwhom I have long resolved on for her husband--meaning I suppose, to\r\nbestow herself on his profligate Brother.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. You know Sir Peter I have always taken the Liberty to differ\r\nwith you on the subject of these two young Gentlemen--I only wish you\r\nmay not be deceived in your opinion of the elder. For Charles, my life\r\non't! He will retrieve his errors yet--their worthy Father, once my\r\nhonour'd master, was at his years nearly as wild a spark.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. You are wrong, Master Rowley--on their Father's Death you\r\nknow I acted as a kind of Guardian to them both--till their uncle Sir\r\nOliver's Eastern Bounty gave them an early independence. Of course no\r\nperson could have more opportunities of judging of their Hearts--and I\r\nwas never mistaken in my life. Joseph is indeed a model for the young\r\nmen of the Age--He is a man of Sentiment--and acts up to the Sentiments\r\nhe professes--but for the other[,] take my word for't [if] he had any\r\ngrain of Virtue by descent--he has dissipated it with the rest of his\r\ninheritance. Ah! my old Friend, Sir Oliver will be deeply mortified when\r\nhe finds how Part of his Bounty has been misapplied.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. I am sorry to find you so violent against the young man because\r\nthis may be the most critical Period of his Fortune. I came hither with\r\nnews that will surprise you.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. What! let me hear--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Sir Oliver is arrived and at this moment in Town.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. How!--you astonish me--I thought you did not expect him this\r\nmonth!--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. I did not--but his Passage has been remarkably quick.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Egad I shall rejoice to see my old Friend--'Tis sixteen years\r\nsince we met--We have had many a Day together--but does he still enjoin\r\nus not to inform his Nephews of his Arrival?\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Most strictly--He means, before He makes it known to make some\r\ntrial of their Dispositions and we have already planned something for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Ah there needs no art to discover their merits--however he\r\nshall have his way--but pray does he know I am married!\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Yes and will soon wish you joy.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. You may tell him 'tis too late--ah Oliver will laugh at\r\nme--we used to rail at matrimony together--but He has been steady to his\r\nText--well He must be at my house tho'--I'll instantly give orders for\r\nhis Reception--but Master Rowley--don't drop a word that Lady Teazle and\r\nI ever disagree.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. By no means.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. For I should never be able to stand Noll's jokes; so I'd have\r\nhim think that we are a very happy couple.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. I understand you--but then you must be very careful not to\r\ndiffer while He's in the House with you.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Egad--and so we must--that's impossible. Ah! Master Rowley\r\nwhen an old Batchelor marries a young wife--He deserves--no the crime\r\ncarries the Punishment along with it.\r\n\r\n     [Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n     END OF THE FIRST ACT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE I.--SIR PETER and LADY TEAZLE\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Lady Teazle--Lady Teazle I'll not bear it.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Sir Peter--Sir Peter you--may scold or smile, according to\r\nyour Humour[,] but I ought to have my own way in everything, and what's\r\nmore I will too--what! tho' I was educated in the country I know very\r\nwell that women of Fashion in London are accountable to nobody after\r\nthey are married.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Very well! ma'am very well! so a husband is to have no\r\ninfluence, no authority?\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Authority! no, to be sure--if you wanted authority over me,\r\nyou should have adopted me and not married me[:] I am sure you were old\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Old enough--aye there it is--well--well--Lady Teazle, tho'\r\nmy life may be made unhappy by your Temper--I'll not be ruined by your\r\nextravagance--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. My extravagance! I'm sure I'm not more extravagant than a\r\nwoman of Fashion ought to be.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. No no Madam, you shall throw away no more sums on such\r\nunmeaning Luxury--'Slife to spend as much to furnish your Dressing Room\r\nwith Flowers in winter as would suffice to turn the Pantheon into a\r\nGreenhouse, and give a Fete Champetre at Christmas.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Lord! Sir Peter am I to blame because Flowers are dear in\r\ncold weather? You should find fault with the Climate, and not with me.\r\nFor my Part I'm sure I wish it was spring all the year round--and that\r\nRoses grew under one's Feet!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Oons! Madam--if you had been born to those Fopperies I\r\nshouldn't wonder at your talking thus;--but you forget what your\r\nsituation was when I married you--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. No, no, I don't--'twas a very disagreeable one or I should\r\nnever nave married you.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes, yes, madam, you were then in somewhat a humbler\r\nStyle--the daughter of a plain country Squire. Recollect Lady Teazle\r\nwhen I saw you first--sitting at your tambour in a pretty figured linen\r\ngown--with a Bunch of Keys at your side, and your apartment hung round\r\nwith Fruits in worsted, of your own working--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. O horrible!--horrible!--don't put me in mind of it!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes, yes Madam and your daily occupation to inspect\r\nthe Dairy, superintend the Poultry, make extracts from the Family\r\nReceipt-book, and comb your aunt Deborah's Lap Dog.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Abominable!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes Madam--and what were your evening amusements? to draw\r\nPatterns for Ruffles, which you hadn't the materials to make--play Pope\r\nJoan with the Curate--to read a sermon to your Aunt--or be stuck down to\r\nan old Spinet to strum your father to sleep after a Fox Chase.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Scandalous--Sir Peter not a word of it true--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes, Madam--These were the recreations I took you from--and\r\nnow--no one more extravagantly in the Fashion--Every Fopery adopted--a\r\nhead-dress to o'er top Lady Pagoda with feathers pendant horizontal and\r\nperpendicular--you forget[,] Lady Teazle--when a little wired gauze with\r\na few Beads made you a fly Cap not much bigger than a blew-bottle, and\r\nyour Hair was comb'd smooth over a Roll--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Shocking! horrible Roll!!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. But now--you must have your coach--Vis-a-vis, and three\r\npowder'd Footmen before your Chair--and in the summer a pair of white\r\ncobs to draw you to Kensington Gardens--no recollection when y ou were\r\ncontent to ride double, behind the Butler, on a docked Coach-Horse?\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Horrid!--I swear I never did.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. This, madam, was your situation--and what have I not done\r\nfor you? I have made you woman of Fashion of Fortune of Rank--in short I\r\nhave made you my wife.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Well then and there is but one thing more you can make me\r\nto add to the obligation.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. What's that pray?\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Your widow.--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Thank you Madam--but don't flatter yourself for though your\r\nill-conduct may disturb my Peace it shall never break my Heart I promise\r\nyou--however I am equally obliged to you for the Hint.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Then why will you endeavour to make yourself so\r\ndisagreeable to me--and thwart me in every little elegant expense.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. 'Slife--Madam I pray, had you any of these elegant expenses\r\nwhen you married me?\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Lud Sir Peter would you have me be out of the Fashion?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. The Fashion indeed!--what had you to do with the Fashion\r\nbefore you married me?\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. For my Part--I should think you would like to have your\r\nwife thought a woman of Taste--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Aye there again--Taste! Zounds Madam you had no Taste when\r\nyou married me--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. That's very true indeed Sir Peter! after having married you\r\nI should never pretend to Taste again I allow.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. So--so then--Madam--if these are your Sentiments pray how\r\ncame I to be honour'd with your Hand?\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Shall I tell you the Truth?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. If it's not too great a Favour.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Why the Fact is I was tired of all those agreeable\r\nRecreations which you have so good naturally [naturedly] Described--and\r\nhaving a Spirit to spend and enjoy a Fortune--I determined to marry the\r\nfirst rich man that would have me.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. A very honest confession--truly--but pray madam was there no\r\none else you might have tried to ensnare but me.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. O lud--I drew my net at several but you were the only one I\r\ncould catch.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. This is plain dealing indeed--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. But now Sir Peter if we have finish'd our daily Jangle I\r\npresume I may go to my engagement at Lady Sneerwell's?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Aye--there's another Precious circumstance--a charming set of\r\nacquaintance--you have made there!\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Nay Sir Peter they are People of Rank and Fortune--and\r\nremarkably tenacious of reputation.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes egad they are tenacious of Reputation with a vengeance,\r\nfor they don't chuse anybody should have a Character but themselves!\r\nSuch a crew! Ah! many a wretch has rid on hurdles who has done less\r\nmischief than these utterers of forged Tales, coiners of Scandal, and\r\nclippers of Reputation.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. What would you restrain the freedom of speech?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Aye they have made you just as bad [as] any one of the\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Why--I believe I do bear a Part with a tolerable Grace--But\r\nI vow I bear no malice against the People I abuse, when I say an\r\nill-natured thing, 'tis out of pure Good Humour--and I take it for\r\ngranted they deal exactly in the same manner with me, but Sir Peter you\r\nknow you promised to come to Lady Sneerwell's too.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Well well I'll call in, just to look after my own character.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Then, indeed, you must make Haste after me, or you'll be\r\ntoo late--so good bye to ye.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. So--I have gain'd much by my intended expostulation--yet\r\nwith what a charming air she contradicts every thing I say--and how\r\npleasingly she shows her contempt of my authority--Well tho' I can't\r\nmake her love me, there is certainly a great satisfaction in quarrelling\r\nwith her; and I think she never appears to such advantage as when she is\r\ndoing everything in her Power to plague me.\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.--At LADY SNEERWELL'S\r\n\r\n     LADY SNEERWELL, MRS. CANDOUR, CRABTREE, SIR BENJAMIN BACKBITE,\r\n     and SURFACE\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Nay, positively, we will hear it.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Yes--yes the Epigram by all means.\r\n\r\nSiR BENJAMIN. O plague on't unkle--'tis mere nonsense--\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. No no; 'fore gad very clever for an extempore!\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. But ladies you should be acquainted with the\r\ncircumstances. You must know that one day last week as Lady Betty\r\nCurricle was taking the Dust in High Park, in a sort of duodecimo\r\nPhaeton--she desired me to write some verses on her Ponies--upon which I\r\ntook out my Pocket-Book--and in one moment produced--the following:--\r\n\r\n   'Sure never were seen two such beautiful Ponies;\r\n   Other Horses are Clowns--and these macaronies,\r\n   Nay to give 'em this Title, I'm sure isn't wrong,\r\n   Their Legs are so slim--and their Tails are so long.\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. There Ladies--done in the smack of a whip and on Horseback\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. A very Phoebus, mounted--indeed Sir Benjamin.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Oh dear Sir--Trifles--Trifles.\r\n\r\n     Enter LADY TEAZLE and MARIA\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. I must have a Copy--\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Lady Teazle--I hope we shall see Sir Peter?\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. I believe He'll wait on your Ladyship presently.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Maria my love you look grave. Come, you sit down to\r\nPiquet with Mr. Surface.\r\n\r\nMARIA. I take very little Pleasure in cards--however, I'll do as you\r\nPlease.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. I am surprised Mr. Surface should sit down her--I thought\r\nHe would have embraced this opportunity of speaking to me before Sir\r\nPeter came--[Aside.]\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Now, I'll die but you are so scandalous I'll forswear your\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. What's the matter, Mrs. Candour?\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. They'll not allow our friend Miss Vermillion to be\r\nhandsome.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Oh, surely she is a pretty woman. . . .\r\n\r\n[CRABTREE.] I am very glad you think so ma'am.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. She has a charming fresh Colour.\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Yes when it is fresh put on--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. O fie! I'll swear her colour is natural--I have seen it\r\ncome and go--\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. I dare swear you have, ma'am: it goes of a Night, and comes\r\nagain in the morning.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. True, uncle, it not only comes and goes but what's more\r\negad her maid can fetch and carry it--\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Ha! ha! ha! how I hate to hear you talk so! But surely,\r\nnow, her Sister, is or was very handsome.\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Who? Mrs. Stucco? O lud! she's six-and-fifty if she's an hour!\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Now positively you wrong her[;] fifty-two, or fifty-three\r\nis the utmost--and I don't think she looks more.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Ah! there's no judging by her looks, unless one was to see\r\nher Face.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Well--well--if she does take some pains to repair the\r\nravages of Time--you must allow she effects it with great ingenuity--and\r\nsurely that's better than the careless manner in which the widow Ocre\r\nchaulks her wrinkles.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Nay now--you are severe upon the widow--come--come, it\r\nisn't that she paints so ill--but when she has finished her Face she\r\njoins it on so badly to her Neck, that she looks like a mended Statue,\r\nin which the Connoisseur sees at once that the Head's modern tho' the\r\nTrunk's antique----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Ha! ha! ha! well said, Nephew!\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Ha! ha! ha! Well, you make me laugh but I vow I hate you\r\nfor it--what do you think of Miss Simper?\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Why, she has very pretty Teeth.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Yes and on that account, when she is neither speaking nor\r\nlaughing (which very seldom happens)--she never absolutely shuts her\r\nmouth, but leaves it always on a-Jar, as it were----\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. How can you be so ill-natured!\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Nay, I allow even that's better than the Pains Mrs. Prim\r\ntakes to conceal her losses in Front--she draws her mouth till it\r\nresembles the aperture of a Poor's-Box, and all her words appear to\r\nslide out edgewise.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Very well Lady Teazle I see you can be a little severe.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. In defence of a Friend it is but justice, but here comes\r\nSir Peter to spoil our Pleasantry.\r\n\r\n     Enter SIR PETER\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Ladies, your obedient--Mercy on me--here is the whole set! a\r\ncharacter's dead at every word, I suppose.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. I am rejoiced you are come, Sir Peter--they have been so\r\ncensorious and Lady Teazle as bad as any one.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. That must be very distressing to you, Mrs. Candour I dare\r\nswear.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. O they will allow good Qualities to nobody--not even good\r\nnature to our Friend Mrs. Pursy.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. What, the fat dowager who was at Mrs. Codrille's\r\n[Quadrille's] last Night?\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Nay--her bulk is her misfortune and when she takes such\r\nPains to get rid of it you ought not to reflect on her.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. 'Tis very true, indeed.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Yes, I know she almost lives on acids and small whey--laces\r\nherself by pulleys and often in the hottest noon of summer you may\r\nsee her on a little squat Pony, with her hair plaited up behind like a\r\nDrummer's and puffing round the Ring on a full trot.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. I thank you Lady Teazle for defending her.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes, a good Defence, truly!\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. But for Sir Benjamin, He is as censorious as Miss Sallow.\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Yes and she is a curious Being to pretend to be censorious--an\r\nawkward Gawky, without any one good Point under Heaven!\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Positively you shall not be so very severe. Miss\r\nSallow is a Relation of mine by marriage, and, as for her Person great\r\nallowance is to be made--for, let me tell you a woman labours under many\r\ndisadvantages who tries to pass for a girl at six-and-thirty.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Tho', surely she is handsome still--and for the weakness\r\nin her eyes considering how much she reads by candle-light it is not to\r\nbe wonder'd at.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. True and then as to her manner--upon my word I think\r\nit is particularly graceful considering she never had the least\r\nEducation[:] for you know her Mother was a Welch milliner, and her\r\nFather a sugar-Baker at Bristow.--\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Ah! you are both of you too good-natured!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes, damned good-natured! Her own relation! mercy on me!\r\n[Aside.]\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. For my Part I own I cannot bear to hear a friend\r\nill-spoken of?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. No, to be sure!\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Ah you are of a moral turn Mrs. Candour and can sit for an\r\nhour to hear Lady Stucco talk sentiments.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Nay I vow Lady Stucco is very well with the Dessert\r\nafter Dinner for she's just like the Spanish Fruit one cracks for\r\nmottoes--made up of Paint and Proverb.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Well, I never will join in ridiculing a Friend--and so I\r\nconstantly tell my cousin Ogle--and you all know what pretensions she\r\nhas to be critical in Beauty.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. O to be sure she has herself the oddest countenance that\r\never was seen--'tis a collection of Features from all the different\r\nCountries of the globe.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. So she has indeed--an Irish Front----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Caledonian Locks----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Dutch Nose----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Austrian Lips----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Complexion of a Spaniard----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. And Teeth a la Chinoise----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. In short, her Face resembles a table d'hote at Spa--where\r\nno two guests are of a nation----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Or a Congress at the close of a general War--wherein all the\r\nmembers even to her eyes appear to have a different interest and her\r\nNose and Chin are the only Parties likely to join issue.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Ha! ha! ha!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Mercy on my Life[!] a Person they dine with twice a week!\r\n[Aside.]\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Go--go--you are a couple of provoking Toads.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Nay but I vow you shall not carry the Laugh off so--for\r\ngive me leave to say, that Mrs. Ogle----\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Madam--madam--I beg your Pardon--there's no stopping these\r\ngood Gentlemen's Tongues--but when I tell you Mrs. Candour that the Lady\r\nthey are abusing is a particular Friend of mine, I hope you'll not take\r\nher Part.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Ha! ha! ha! well said, Sir Peter--but you are a cruel\r\ncreature--too Phlegmatic yourself for a jest and too peevish to allow\r\nwit in others.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Ah Madam true wit is more nearly allow'd [allied?] to good\r\nNature than your Ladyship is aware of.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. True Sir Peter--I believe they are so near akin that\r\nthey can never be united.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. O rather Madam suppose them man and wife because one\r\nseldom sees them together.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. But Sir Peter is such an Enemy to Scandal I believe He\r\nwould have it put down by Parliament.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. 'Fore heaven! Madam, if they were to consider the Sporting\r\nwith Reputation of as much importance as poaching on manors--and pass\r\nan Act for the Preservation of Fame--there are many would thank them for\r\nthe Bill.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. O Lud! Sir Peter would you deprive us of our\r\nPrivileges--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Aye Madam--and then no person should be permitted to\r\nkill characters or run down reputations, but qualified old Maids and\r\ndisappointed Widows.--\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Go, you monster--\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. But sure you would not be quite so severe on those who\r\nonly report what they hear?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes Madam, I would have Law Merchant for that too--and in all\r\ncases of slander currency, whenever the Drawer of the Lie was not to\r\nbe found, the injured Party should have a right to come on any of the\r\nindorsers.\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Well for my Part I believe there never was a Scandalous Tale\r\nwithout some foundation.<3>\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Come Ladies shall we sit down to Cards in the next Room?\r\n\r\n     Enter SERVANT, whispers SIR PETER\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. I'll be with them directly.--\r\n\r\n     [Exit SERVANT.]\r\nI'll get away unperceived.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Sir Peter you are not leaving us?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Your Ladyship must excuse me--I'm called away by particular\r\nBusiness--but I leave my Character behind me--\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Well certainly Lady Teazle that lord of yours is a\r\nstrange being--I could tell you some stories of him would make you laugh\r\nheartily if He wern't your Husband.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. O pray don't mind that--come do let's hear 'em.\r\n\r\n     [join the rest of the Company going into the Next Room.]\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Maria I see you have no satisfaction in this society.\r\n\r\nMARIA. How is it possible I should? If to raise malicious smiles at the\r\ninfirmities or misfortunes of those who have never injured us be\r\nthe province of wit or Humour, Heaven grant me a double Portion of\r\nDullness--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Yet they appear more ill-natured than they are--they have no\r\nmalice at heart--\r\n\r\nMARIA. Then is their conduct still more contemptible[;] for in my\r\nopinion--nothing could excuse the intemperance of their tongues but a\r\nnatural and ungovernable bitterness of Mind.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Undoubtedly Madam--and it has always been a sentiment of\r\nmine--that to propagate a malicious Truth wantonly--is more despicable\r\nthan to falsify from Revenge, but can you Maria feel thus [f]or others\r\nand be unkind to me alone--nay is hope to be denied the tenderest\r\nPassion.--\r\n\r\nMARIA. Why will you distress me by renewing this subject--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Ah! Maria! you would not treat me thus and oppose your\r\nguardian's Sir Peter's wishes--but that I see that my Profligate Brother\r\nis still a favour'd Rival.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Ungenerously urged--but whatever my sentiments of that\r\nunfortunate young man are, be assured I shall not feel more bound to\r\ngive him up because his Distresses have sunk him so low as to deprive\r\nhim of the regard even of a Brother.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Nay but Maria do not leave me with a Frown--by all that's\r\nhonest, I swear----Gad's Life here's Lady Teazle--you must not--no you\r\nshall--for tho' I have the greatest Regard for Lady Teazle----\r\n\r\nMARIA. Lady Teazle!\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Yet were Sir Peter to suspect----\r\n\r\n     [Enter LADY TEAZLE, and comes forward]\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. What's this, Pray--do you take her for me!--Child you are\r\nwanted in the next Room.--What's all this, pray--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. O the most unlucky circumstance in Nature. Maria has somehow\r\nsuspected the tender concern I have for your happiness, and threaten'd\r\nto acquaint Sir Peter with her suspicions--and I was just endeavouring\r\nto reason with her when you came.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Indeed but you seem'd to adopt--a very tender mode of\r\nreasoning--do you usually argue on your knees?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. O she's a Child--and I thought a little Bombast----but Lady\r\nTeazle when are you to give me your judgment on my Library as you\r\npromised----\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. No--no I begin to think it would be imprudent--and you know\r\nI admit you as a Lover no farther than Fashion requires.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. True--a mere Platonic Cicisbeo, what every London wife is\r\nentitled to.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Certainly one must not be out of the Fashion--however, I\r\nhave so much of my country Prejudices left--that--though Sir Peter's ill\r\nhumour may vex me ever so, it never shall provoke me to----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. The only revenge in your Power--well I applaud your moderation.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Go--you are an insinuating Hypocrite--but we shall be\r\nmiss'd--let us join the company.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. True, but we had best not return together.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Well don't stay--for Maria shan't come to hear any more of\r\nyour Reasoning, I promise you--\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\nSURFACE. A curious Dilemma truly my Politics have run me into. I wanted\r\nat first only to ingratiate myself with Lady Teazle that she might not\r\nbe my enemy with Maria--and I have I don't know how--become her\r\nserious Lover, so that I stand a chance of Committing a Crime I never\r\nmeditated--and probably of losing Maria by the Pursuit!--Sincerely I\r\nbegin to wish I had never made such a Point of gaining so very good a\r\ncharacter, for it has led me into so many curst Rogueries that I doubt I\r\nshall be exposed at last.\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.--At SIR PETER'S\r\n\r\n     --ROWLEY and SIR OLIVER--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Ha! ha! ha! and so my old Friend is married, hey?--a young\r\nwife out of the country!--ha! ha! that he should have stood Bluff to old\r\nBachelor so long and sink into a Husband at last!\r\n\r\nROWLEY. But you must not rally him on the subject Sir Oliver--'tis a\r\ntender Point I assure you though He has been married only seven months.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Ah then he has been just half a year on the stool\r\nof Repentance--Poor Peter! But you say he has entirely given up\r\nCharles--never sees him, hey?\r\n\r\nROWLEY. His Prejudice against him is astonishing--and I am sure greatly\r\nincreased by a jealousy of him with Lady Teazle--which he has\r\nbeen industriously led into by a scandalous Society--in the\r\nneighbourhood--who have contributed not a little to Charles's ill name.\r\nWhereas the truth is[,] I believe[,] if the lady is partial to either of\r\nthem his Brother is the Favourite.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Aye--I know--there are a set of malicious prating prudent\r\nGossips both male and Female, who murder characters to kill time, and\r\nwill rob a young Fellow of his good name before He has years to know the\r\nvalue of it. . . but I am not to be prejudiced against my nephew by\r\nsuch I promise you! No! no--if Charles has done nothing false or mean, I\r\nshall compound for his extravagance.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Then my life on't, you will reclaim him. Ah, Sir, it gives me\r\nnew vigour to find that your heart is not turned against him--and that\r\nthe son of my good old master has one friend however left--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. What! shall I forget Master Rowley--when I was at his\r\nhouse myself--egad my Brother and I were neither of us very prudent\r\nyouths--and yet I believe you have not seen many better men than your\r\nold master was[.]\r\n\r\nROWLEY. 'Tis this Reflection gives me assurance that Charles may yet be\r\na credit to his Family--but here comes Sir Peter----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Egad so He does--mercy on me--He's greatly altered--and\r\nseems to have a settled married look--one may read Husband in his Face\r\nat this Distance.--\r\n\r\n     Enter SIR PETER\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Ha! Sir Oliver--my old Friend--welcome to England--a thousand\r\nTimes!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Thank you--thank you--Sir Peter--and Efaith I am as glad to\r\nfind you well[,] believe me--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Ah! 'tis a long time since we met--sixteen year I doubt Sir\r\nOliver--and many a cross accident in the Time--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Aye I have had my share--but, what[!] I find you are\r\nmarried--hey my old Boy--well--well it can't be help'd--and so I wish\r\nyou joy with all my heart--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Thank you--thanks Sir Oliver.--Yes, I have entered into the\r\nhappy state but we'll not talk of that now.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. True true Sir Peter old Friends shouldn't begin on\r\ngrievances at first meeting. No, no--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Take care pray Sir----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Well--so one of my nephews I find is a wild Rogue--hey?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Wild!--oh! my old Friend--I grieve for your disappointment\r\nthere--He's a lost young man indeed--however his Brother will make you\r\namends; Joseph is indeed what a youth should be--everybody in the world\r\nspeaks well of him--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. I am sorry to hear it--he has too good a character to be an\r\nhonest Fellow. Everybody speaks well of him! Psha! then He has bow'd as\r\nlow to Knaves and Fools as to the honest dignity of Virtue.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. What Sir Oliver do you blame him for not making Enemies?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Yes--if He has merit enough to deserve them.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Well--well--you'll be convinced when you know him--'tis\r\nedification to hear him converse--he professes the noblest Sentiments.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Ah plague on his Sentiments--if he salutes me with a scrap\r\nsentence of morality in his mouth I shall be sick directly--but however\r\ndon't mistake me Sir Peter I don't mean to defend Charles's Errors--but\r\nbefore I form my judgment of either of them, I intend to make a trial of\r\ntheir Hearts--and my Friend Rowley and I have planned something for the\r\nPurpose.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. And Sir Peter shall own he has been for once mistaken.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. My life on Joseph's Honour----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Well come give us a bottle of good wine--and we'll drink the\r\nLads' Healths and tell you our scheme.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Alons [Allons], then----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. But don't Sir Peter be so severe against your old Friend's\r\nson.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. 'Tis his Vices and Follies have made me his Enemy.--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Come--come--Sir Peter consider how early He was left to his own\r\nguidance.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Odds my Life--I am not sorry that He has run out of the\r\ncourse a little--for my Part, I hate to see dry Prudence clinging to\r\nthe green juices of youth--'tis like ivy round a sapling and spoils the\r\ngrowth of the Tree.\r\n\r\n     END OF THE SECOND ACT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE I.--At SIR PETER'S\r\n\r\n     SIR PETER, SIR OLIVER, and ROWLEY\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Well, then, we will see the Fellows first and have our wine\r\nafterwards.--but how is this, Master Rowley--I don't see the Jet of your\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Why Sir--this Mr. Stanley whom I was speaking of, is nearly\r\nrelated to them by their mother. He was once a merchant in Dublin--but\r\nhas been ruined by a series of undeserved misfortunes--and now lately\r\ncoming over to solicit the assistance of his friends here--has been\r\nflyng [flung] into prison by some of his Creditors--where he is now with\r\ntwo helpless Boys.--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Aye and a worthy Fellow too I remember him. But what is this\r\nto lead to--?\r\n\r\nROWLEY. You shall hear--He has applied by letter both to Mr. Surface and\r\nCharles--from the former he has received nothing but evasive promises\r\nof future service, while Charles has done all that his extravagance has\r\nleft him power to do--and He is at this time endeavouring to raise a sum\r\nof money--part of which, in the midst of his own distresses, I know He\r\nintends for the service of poor Stanley.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Ah! he is my Brother's Son.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Well, but how is Sir Oliver personally to----\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Why Sir I will inform Charles and his Brother that Stanley has\r\nobtain'd permission to apply in person to his Friends--and as they\r\nhave neither of them ever seen him[,] let Sir Oliver assume his\r\ncharacter--and he will have a fair opportunity of judging at least of\r\nthe Benevolence of their Dispositions.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Pshaw! this will prove nothing--I make no doubt Charles is\r\nCoxcomb and thoughtless enough to give money to poor relations if he had\r\nit--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Then He shall never want it--. I have brought a few Rupees\r\nhome with me Sir Peter--and I only want to be sure of bestowing them\r\nrightly.--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Then Sir believe me you will find in the youngest Brother one\r\nwho in the midst of Folly and dissipation--has still, as our immortal\r\nBard expresses it,--\r\n\r\n   \"a Tear for Pity and a Hand open as the day for melting Charity.\"\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Pish! What signifies his having an open Hand or Purse\r\neither when He has nothing left to give!--but if you talk of humane\r\nSentiments--Joseph is the man--Well, well, make the trial, if you\r\nplease. But where is the fellow whom you brought for Sir Oliver to\r\nexamine, relative to Charles's affairs?\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Below waiting his commands, and no one can give him better\r\nintelligence--This, Sir Oliver, is a friendly Jew, who to do him\r\njustice, has done everything in his power to bring your nephew to a\r\nproper sense of his extravagance.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Pray let us have him in.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Desire Mr. Moses to walk upstairs.\r\n\r\n     [Calls to SERVANT.]\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. But Pray why should you suppose he will speak the truth?\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Oh, I have convinced him that he has no chance of recovering\r\ncertain Sums advanced to Charles but through the bounty of Sir Oliver,\r\nwho He knows is arrived; so that you may depend on his Fidelity to his\r\ninterest. I have also another evidence in my Power, one Snake, whom I\r\nshall shortly produce to remove some of YOUR Prejudices[,] Sir Peter[,]\r\nrelative to Charles and Lady Teazle.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. I have heard too much on that subject.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Here comes the honest Israelite.\r\n\r\n     Enter MOSES\r\n--This is Sir Oliver.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Sir--I understand you have lately had great dealings with my\r\nNephew Charles.\r\n\r\nMOSES. Yes Sir Oliver--I have done all I could for him, but He was\r\nruined before He came to me for Assistance.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. That was unlucky truly--for you have had no opportunity of\r\nshowing your Talents.\r\n\r\nMOSES. None at all--I hadn't the Pleasure of knowing his Distresses till\r\nhe was some thousands worse than nothing, till it was impossible to add\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Unfortunate indeed! but I suppose you have done all in your\r\nPower for him honest Moses?\r\n\r\nMOSES. Yes he knows that--This very evening I was to have brought him a\r\ngentleman from the city who does not know him and will I believe advance\r\nsome money.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. What[!] one Charles has never had money from before?\r\n\r\nMOSES. Yes[--]Mr. Premium, of Crutched Friars.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Egad, Sir Oliver a Thought strikes me!--Charles you say\r\ndoes'nt know Mr. Premium?\r\n\r\nMOSES. Not at all.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Now then Sir Oliver you may have a better opportunity of\r\nsatisfying yourself than by an old romancing tale of a poor Relation--go\r\nwith my friend Moses and represent Mr. Premium and then I'll answer\r\nfor't you'll see your Nephew in all his glory.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Egad I like this Idea better than the other, and I may visit\r\nJoseph afterwards as old Stanley.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. True so you may.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Well this is taking Charles rather at a disadvantage, to be\r\nsure--however Moses--you understand Sir Peter and will be faithful----\r\n\r\nMOSES. You may depend upon me--and this is near the Time I was to have\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. I'll accompany you as soon as you please, Moses----but\r\nhold--I have forgot one thing--how the plague shall I be able to pass\r\nfor a Jew?\r\n\r\nMOSES. There's no need--the Principal is Christian.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Is He--I'm very sorry to hear it--but then again--an't I\r\nrather too smartly dressed to look like a money-Lender?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Not at all; 'twould not be out of character, if you went in\r\nyour own carriage--would it, Moses!\r\n\r\nMOSES. Not in the least.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Well--but--how must I talk[?] there's certainly some cant of\r\nusury and mode of treating that I ought to know.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Oh, there's not much to learn--the great point as I take it\r\nis to be exorbitant enough in your Demands hey Moses?\r\n\r\nMOSES. Yes that's very great Point.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. I'll answer for't I'll not be wanting in that--I'll ask him\r\neight or ten per cent. on the loan--at least.\r\n\r\nMOSES. You'll be found out directly--if you ask him no more than that,\r\nyou'll be discovered immediately.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Hey!--what the Plague!--how much then?\r\n\r\nMOSES. That depends upon the Circumstances--if he appears not very\r\nanxious for the supply, you should require only forty or fifty per\r\ncent.--but if you find him in great Distress, and want the monies very\r\nbad--you may ask double.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. A good--[h]onest Trade you're learning, Sir Oliver--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Truly, I think so--and not unprofitable--\r\n\r\nMOSES. Then you know--you haven't the monies yourself, but are forced to\r\nborrow them for him of a Friend.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. O I borrow it of a Friend do I?\r\n\r\nMOSES. And your friend is an unconscion'd Dog--but you can't help it.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. My Friend's an unconscionable Dog, is he?\r\n\r\nMOSES. Yes--and He himself hasn't the monies by him--but is forced to\r\nsell stock--at a great loss--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. He is forced to sell stock is he--at a great loss, is\r\nhe--well that's very kind of him--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Efaith, Sir Oliver--Mr. Premium I mean--you'll soon be master\r\nof the Trade--but, Moses would have him inquire if the borrower is a\r\nminor--\r\n\r\nMOSES. O yes--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. And in that case his Conscience will direct him--\r\n\r\nMOSES. To have the Bond in another Name to be sure.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Well--well I shall be perfect--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. But hearkee wouldn't you have him also run out a little\r\nagainst the annuity Bill--that would be in character I should think--\r\n\r\nMOSES. Very much--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. And lament that a young man now must be at years of discretion\r\nbefore He is suffered to ruin himself!\r\n\r\nMOSES. Aye, great Pity!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. And abuse the Public for allowing merit to an act whose only\r\nobject is to snatch misfortune and imprudence from the rapacious Relief\r\nof usury! and give the minor a chance of inheriting his estate without\r\nbeing undone by coming into Possession.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. So--so--Moses shall give me further instructions as we go\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. You will not have much time[,] for your Nephew lives hard\r\nbye--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Oh Never--fear[:] my Tutor appears so able that tho' Charles\r\nlived in the next street it must be my own Fault if I am not a compleat\r\nRogue before I turn the Corner--\r\n\r\n     [Exeunt SIR OLIVER and MOSES.]\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. So--now I think Sir Oliver will be convinced--you shan't\r\nfollow them Rowley. You are partial and would have prepared Charles for\r\n'tother plot.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. No upon my word Sir Peter--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Well, go bring me this Snake, and I'll hear what he has to\r\nsay presently. I see Maria, and want to speak with her.--\r\n\r\n     [Exit ROWLEY.]\r\nI should be glad to be convinced my suspicions of Lady Teazle and\r\nCharles were unjust--I have never yet opened my mind on this subject to\r\nmy Friend Joseph. . . . I am determined. I will do it--He will give me\r\nhis opinion sincerely.--\r\n\r\n     Enter MARIA\r\n\r\nSo Child--has Mr. Surface returned with you--\r\n\r\nMARIA. No Sir--He was engaged.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Well--Maria--do you not reflect[,] the more you converse with\r\nthat amiable young man[,] what return his Partiality for you deserves?\r\n\r\nMARIA. Indeed Sir Peter--your frequent importunity on this subject\r\ndistresses me extremely--you compell me to Declare that I know no man\r\nwho has ever paid me a particular Attention whom I would not prefer to\r\nMr. Surface--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Soh! Here's Perverseness--no--no--Maria, 'tis Charles only\r\nwhom you would prefer--'tis evident his Vices and Follies have won your\r\nHeart.\r\n\r\nMARIA. This is unkind Sir--You know I have obey'd you in neither seeing\r\nnor corresponding with him--I have heard enough to convince me that\r\nHe is unworthy my regard--Yet I cannot think it culpable--if while my\r\nunderstanding severely condemns his Vices, my Heart suggests some Pity\r\nfor his Distresses.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Well well pity him as much as you please, but give your Heart\r\nand Hand to a worthier object.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Never to his Brother!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Go--perverse and obstinate! but take care, Madam--you have\r\nnever yet known what the authority of a Guardian is--don't compel me to\r\ninform you of it.--\r\n\r\nMARIA. I can only say, you shall not have just Reason--'tis true, by\r\nmy Father's will I am for a short period bound to regard you as his\r\nsubstitute, but I must cease to think you so when you would compel me to\r\nbe miserable.\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Was ever man so crossed as I am[?] everything conspiring to\r\nfret me! I had not been involved in matrimony a fortnight[,] before\r\nher Father--a hale and hearty man, died on purpose, I believe--for the\r\nPleasure of plaguing me with the care of his Daughter . . . but here\r\ncomes my Helpmate!--She appears in great good humour----how happy I\r\nshould be if I could teaze her into loving me tho' but a little----\r\n\r\n     Enter LADY TEAZLE\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Lud! Sir Peter I hope you haven't been quarrelling with\r\nMaria? It isn't using me well to be ill humour'd when I am not bye--!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Ah! Lady Teazle you might have the Power to make me good\r\nhumour'd at all times--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. I am sure--I wish I had--for I want you to be in a charming\r\nsweet temper at this moment--do be good humour'd now--and let me have\r\ntwo hundred Pounds will you?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Two hundred Pounds! what an't I to be in a good humour\r\nwithout paying for it--but speak to me thus--and Efaith there's nothing\r\nI could refuse you. You shall have it--but seal me a bond for the\r\nrepayment.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. O no--there--my Note of Hand will do as well--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. And you shall no longer reproach me with not giving you an\r\nindependent settlement--I shall shortly surprise you--and you'll not\r\ncall me ungenerous--but shall we always live thus--hey?\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. If you--please--I'm sure I don't care how soon we leave off\r\nquarrelling provided you'll own you were tired first--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Well--then let our future contest be who shall be most\r\nobliging.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. I assure you Sir Peter Good Nature becomes you--you look\r\nnow as you did before we were married--when you used to walk with me\r\nunder the Elms, and tell me stories of what a Gallant you were in your\r\nyouth--and chuck me under the chin you would--and ask me if I thought I\r\ncould love an old Fellow who would deny me nothing--didn't you?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes--yes--and you were as kind and attentive----\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Aye so I was--and would always take your Part, when my\r\nacquaintance used to abuse you and turn you into ridicule--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Indeed!\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Aye--and when my cousin Sophy has called you a stiff\r\npeevish old batchelor and laugh'd at me for thinking of marrying one who\r\nmight be my Father--I have always defended you--and said I didn't think\r\nyou so ugly by any means, and that you'd make a very good sort of a\r\nhusband--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. And you prophesied right--and we shall certainly now be the\r\nhappiest couple----\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. And never differ again.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. No never--tho' at the same time indeed--my dear Lady\r\nTeazle--you must watch your Temper very narrowly--for in all our little\r\nQuarrels--my dear--if you recollect my Love you always began first--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. I beg your Pardon--my dear Sir Peter--indeed--you always\r\ngave the provocation.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Now--see, my Love take care--contradicting isn't the way to\r\nkeep Friends.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Then don't you begin it my Love!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. There now--you are going on--you don't perceive[,] my Life,\r\nthat you are just doing the very thing my Love which you know always\r\nmakes me angry.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Nay--you know if you will be angry without any reason--my\r\nDear----\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. There now you want to quarrel again.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. No--I am sure I don't--but if you will be so peevish----\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. There--now who begins first?\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Why you to be sure--I said nothing[--]but there's no\r\nbearing your Temper.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. No--no--my dear--the fault's in your own temper.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Aye you are just what my Cousin Sophy said you would be--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Your Cousin Sophy--is a forward impertinent Gipsey--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Go you great Bear--how dare you abuse my Relations--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Now may all the Plagues of marriage be doubled on me, if ever\r\nI try to be Friends with you any more----\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. So much the Better.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. No--no Madam 'tis evident you never cared a pin for me--I was\r\na madman to marry you--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. And I am sure I was a Fooll to marry you--an old dangling\r\nBatchelor, who was single of [at] fifty--only because He never could\r\nmeet with any one who would have him.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Aye--aye--Madam--but you were pleased enough to listen to\r\nme--you never had such an offer before--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. No--didn't I refuse Sir Jeremy Terrier--who everybody\r\nsaid would have been a better Match--for his estate is just as good as\r\nyours--and he has broke his Neck since we have been married!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. I have done with you Madam! You are an\r\nunfeeling--ungrateful--but there's an end of everything--I believe you\r\ncapable of anything that's bad--Yes, Madam--I now believe the Reports\r\nrelative to you and Charles--Madam--yes--Madam--you and Charles are--not\r\nwithout grounds----\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Take--care Sir Peter--you had better not insinuate any such\r\nthing! I'll not be suspected without cause I promise you----\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Very--well--Madam--very well! a separate maintenance--as soon\r\nas you Please. Yes Madam or a Divorce--I'll make an example of myself\r\nfor the Benefit of all old Batchelors--Let us separate, Madam.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Agreed--agreed--and now--my dear Sir Peter we are of a\r\nmind again, we may be the happiest couple--and never differ again, you\r\nknow--ha! ha!--Well you are going to be in a Passion I see--and I shall\r\nonly interrupt you--so, bye! bye! hey--young Jockey try'd and countered.\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Plagues and tortures! She pretends to keep her temper, can't\r\nI make her angry neither! O! I am the miserable fellow! But I'll not\r\nbear her presuming to keep her Temper--No she may break my Heart--but\r\nshe shan't keep her Temper.\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.--At CHARLES's House\r\n\r\n     Enter TRIP, MOSES, and SIR OLIVER\r\n\r\nTRIP. Here Master Moses--if you'll stay a moment--I'll try whether\r\nMr.----what's the Gentleman's Name?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Mr.----Moses--what IS my name----\r\n\r\nMOSES. Mr. Premium----\r\n\r\nTRIP. Premium--very well.\r\n\r\n     [Exit TRIP--taking snuff.]\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. To judge by the Servants--one wouldn't believe the master\r\nwas ruin'd--but what--sure this was my Brother's House----\r\n\r\nMOSES. Yes Sir Mr. Charles bought it of Mr. Joseph with the Furniture,\r\nPictures, &c.--just as the old Gentleman left it--Sir Peter thought it a\r\ngreat piece of extravagance in him.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. In my mind the other's economy in selling it to him was more\r\nreprehensible by half.----\r\n\r\n     Enter TRIP\r\n\r\nTRIP. My Master[,] Gentlemen[,] says you must wait, he has company, and\r\ncan't speak with you yet.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. If he knew who it was wanted to see him, perhaps he wouldn't\r\nhave sent such a Message.\r\n\r\nTRIP. Yes--yes--Sir--He knows you are here--I didn't forget little\r\nPremium--no--no----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Very well--and pray Sir what may be your Name?\r\n\r\nTRIP. Trip Sir--my Name is Trip, at your Service.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Well then Mr. Trip--I presume your master is seldom without\r\ncompany----\r\n\r\nTRIP. Very seldom Sir--the world says ill-natured things of him but 'tis\r\nall malice--no man was ever better beloved--Sir he seldom sits down to\r\ndinner without a dozen particular Friends----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. He's very happy indeed--you have a pleasant sort of Place\r\nhere I guess?\r\n\r\nTRIP. Why yes--here are three or four of us pass our time agreeably\r\nenough--but then our wages are sometimes a little in arrear--and not\r\nvery great either--but fifty Pounds a year and find our own Bags and\r\nBouquets----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Bags and Bouquets!--Halters and Bastinadoes! [Aside.]\r\n\r\nTRIP. But a propos Moses--have you been able to get me that little Bill\r\ndiscounted?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Wants to raise money too!--mercy on me! has his distresses,\r\nI warrant[,] like a Lord--and affects Creditors and Duns! [Aside.]\r\n\r\nMOSES. 'Twas not be done, indeed----\r\n\r\nTRIP. Good lack--you surprise me--My Friend Brush has indorsed it and\r\nI thought when he put his name at the Back of a Bill 'twas as good as\r\ncash.\r\n\r\nMOSES. No 'twouldn't do.\r\n\r\nTRIP. A small sum--but twenty Pound--harkee, Moses do you think you\r\ncould get it me by way of annuity?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. An annuity! ha! ha! a Footman raise money by annuity--Well\r\ndone Luxury egad! [Aside.]\r\n\r\nMOSES. Who would you get to join with you?\r\n\r\nTRIP. You know my Lord Applice--you have seen him however----\r\n\r\nMOSES. Yes----\r\n\r\nTRIP. You must have observed what an appearance he makes--nobody dresses\r\nbetter, nobody throws off faster--very well this Gentleman will stand my\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nMOSES. Well--but you must insure your Place.\r\n\r\nTRIP. O with all my Heart--I'll insure my Place, and my Life too, if you\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. It's more than I would your neck----\r\n\r\nMOSES. But is there nothing you could deposit?\r\n\r\nTRIP. Why nothing capital of my master's wardrobe has drop'd lately--but\r\nI could give you a mortgage on some of his winter Cloaths with equity\r\nof redemption before November or--you shall have the reversion--of the\r\nFrench velvet, or a post obit on the Blue and Silver--these I\r\nshould think Moses--with a few Pair of Point Ruffles as a collateral\r\nsecurity--hey, my little Fellow?\r\n\r\nMOSES. Well well--we'll talk presently--we detain the Gentlemen----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. O pray don't let me interrupt Mr. Trip's Negotiation.\r\n\r\nTRIP. Harkee--I heard the Bell--I believe, Gentlemen I can now introduce\r\nyou--don't forget the annuity little Moses.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. If the man be a shadow of his Master this is the Temple of\r\nDissipation indeed!\r\n\r\n     [Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.--CHARLES, CARELESS, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n     At Table with Wine\r\n\r\nCHARLES. 'Fore Heaven, 'tis true!--there is the great Degeneracy of the\r\nage--many of our acquaintance have Taste--Spirit, and Politeness--but\r\nplague on't they won't drink----\r\n\r\nCARELESS. It is so indeed--Charles--they give into all the substantial\r\nLuxuries of the Table--and abstain from nothing but wine and wit--Oh,\r\ncertainly society suffers by it intolerably--for now instead of the\r\nsocial spirit of Raillery that used to mantle over a glass of bright\r\nBurgundy their conversation is become just like the Spa water they\r\ndrink which has all the Pertness and flatulence of champaine without its\r\nspirit or Flavour.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN. But what are they to do who love Play better than\r\nwine----\r\n\r\nCARELESS. True--there's Harry diets himself--for gaming and is now under\r\na hazard Regimen.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Then He'll have the worst of it--what you wouldn't train a\r\nhorse for the course by keeping him from corn--For my Part egad I am\r\nnever so successful as when I'm a little--merry--let me throw on a\r\nBottle of Champaine and I never lose--at least I never feel my losses\r\nwhich is exactly the same thing.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN. Aye that may be--but it is as impossible to follow\r\nwine and play as to unite Love and Politics.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Pshaw--you may do both--Caesar made Love and Laws in a\r\nBreath--and was liked by the Senate as well as the Ladies--but no man\r\ncan pretend to be a Believer in Love, who is an abjurer of wine--'tis\r\nthe Test by which a Lover knows his own Heart--fill a dozen Bumpers to a\r\ndozen Beauties, and she that floats atop is the maid that has bewitched\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Now then Charles--be honest and give us yours----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Why I have withheld her only in compassion to you--if I toast\r\nher you should give a round of her Peers, which is impossible! on earth!\r\n\r\nCARELESS. O, then we'll find some canonized Vestals or heathen Goddesses\r\nthat will do I warrant----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Here then--Bumpers--you Rogues--Bumpers! Maria--Maria----\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN. Maria who?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Oh, damn the Surname 'tis too formal to be register'd in\r\nLove's calendar--but now Careless beware--beware--we must have Beauty's\r\nsuperlative.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN. Nay Never study[,] Careless--we'll stand to the\r\nToast--tho' your mistress should want an eye--and you know you have a\r\nsong will excuse you----\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Egad so I have--and I'll give him the song instead of the\r\nLady.----\r\n\r\n     SONG.--AND CHORUS--<4>\r\n\r\n     Here's to the maiden of bashful fifteen;\r\n        Here's to the widow of fifty;\r\n     Here's to the flaunting extravagant quean,\r\n        And here's to the housewife that's thrifty.\r\n     Chorus.  Let the toast pass,--\r\n                  Drink to the lass,\r\n     I'll warrant she'll prove an excuse for a glass.\r\n\r\n     Here's to the charmer whose dimples we prize;\r\n        Now to the maid who has none, sir;\r\n     Here's to the girl with a pair of blue eyes,\r\n        And here's to the nymph with but one, sir.\r\n     Chorus.  Let the toast pass, &c.\r\n\r\n     Here's to the maid with a bosom of snow:\r\n        Now to her that's as brown as a berry:\r\n     Here's to the wife with a face full of woe,\r\n        And now to the damsel that's merry.\r\n     Chorus.  Let the toast pass, &c.\r\n\r\n     For let 'em be clumsy, or let 'em be slim,\r\n        Young or ancient, I care not a feather;\r\n     So fill a pint bumper quite up to the brim,\r\n     So fill up your glasses, nay, fill to the brim,\r\n        And let us e'en toast them together.\r\n     Chorus.  Let the toast pass, &c.\r\n\r\n     [Enter TRIP whispers CHARLES]\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN. Bravo Careless--Ther's Toast and Sentiment too.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN. E' faith there's infinite charity in that song.----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Gentlemen, you must excuse me a little.--Careless, take the\r\nChair, will you?\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Nay prithee, Charles--what now--this is one of your Peerless\r\nBeauties I suppose--has dropped in by chance?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. No--Faith--to tell you the Truth 'tis a Jew and a Broker who\r\nare come by appointment.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. O dam it let's have the Jew in.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN. Aye and the Broker too by all means----\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN. Yes yes the Jew and the Broker.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Egad with all my Heart--Trip--bid the Gentlemen walk in--tho'\r\nthere's one of them a Stranger I can tell you----\r\n\r\nTRIP. What Sir--would you chuse Mr. Premium to come up with----\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN. Yes--yes Mr. Premium certainly.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. To be sure--Mr. Premium--by all means Charles, let us give\r\nthem some generous Burgundy, and perhaps they'll grow conscientious----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. O, Hang 'em--no--wine does but draw forth a man's natural\r\nqualities; and to make them drink would only be to whet their Knavery.\r\n\r\n     Enter TRIP, SIR OLIVER, and MOSES\r\n\r\nCHARLES. So--honest Moses--walk in--walk in pray Mr. Premium--that's the\r\nGentleman's name isn't it Moses.\r\n\r\nMOSES. Yes Sir.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Set chairs--Trim.--Sit down, Mr Premium.--Glasses Trim.--sit\r\ndown Moses.--Come, Mr. Premium I'll give you a sentiment--Here's Success\r\nto Usury--Moses fill the Gentleman a bumper.\r\n\r\nMOSES. Success to Usury!\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Right Moses--Usury is Prudence and industry and deserves to\r\nsucceed----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Then Here is--all the success it deserves!     [Drinks.]\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Mr. Premium you and I are but strangers yet--but I hope we\r\nshall be better acquainted by and bye----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Yes Sir hope we shall--more intimately perhaps than you'll\r\nwish. [Aside.<5>]\r\n\r\nCARELESS. No, no, that won't do! Mr. Premium, you have demurred at the\r\ntoast, and must drink it in a pint bumper.\r\n\r\nFIRST GENTLEMAN. A pint bumper, at least.\r\n\r\nMOSES. Oh, pray, sir, consider--Mr. Premium's a gentleman.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. And therefore loves good wine.\r\n\r\nSECOND GENTLEMAN. Give Moses a quart glass--this is mutiny, and a high\r\ncontempt for the chair.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Here, now for't! I'll see justice done, to the last drop of my\r\nbottle.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Nay, pray, gentlemen--I did not expect this usage.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. No, hang it, you shan't; Mr. Premium's a stranger.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Odd! I wish I was well out of their company. [Aside.]\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Plague on 'em then! if they won't drink, we'll not sit down\r\nwith them. Come, Harry, the dice are in the next room.--Charles, you'll\r\njoin us when you have finished your business with the gentlemen?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. I will! I will!--\r\n\r\n     [Exeunt SIR HARRY BUMPER and GENTLEMEN; CARELESS following.]\r\nCareless.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. [Returning.] Well!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Perhaps I may want you.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Oh, you know I am always ready: word, note, or bond, 'tis all\r\nthe same to me.\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\nMOSES. Sir, this is Mr. Premium, a gentleman of the strictest honour\r\nand secrecy; and always performs what he undertakes. Mr. Premium, this\r\nis----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Psha! have done. Sir, my friend Moses is a very honest fellow,\r\nbut a little slow at expression: he'll be an hour giving us our titles.\r\nMr. Premium, the plain state of the matter is this: I am an extravagant\r\nyoung fellow who wants to borrow money; you I take to be a prudent old\r\nfellow, who have got money to lend. I am blockhead enough to give fifty\r\nper cent. sooner than not have it! and you, I presume, are rogue enough\r\nto take a hundred if you can get it. Now, sir, you see we are acquainted\r\nat once, and may proceed to business without further ceremony.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Exceeding frank, upon my word. I see, sir, you are not a man\r\nof many compliments.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Oh, no, sir! plain dealing in business I always think best.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Sir, I like you the better for it. However, You are mistaken\r\nin one thing; I have no money to lend, but I believe I could procure\r\nsome of a friend; but then he's an unconscionable dog. Isn't he, Moses?\r\nAnd must sell stock to accommodate you. Mustn't he, Moses!\r\n\r\nMOSES. Yes, indeed! You know I always speak the truth, and scorn to tell\r\na lie!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Right. People that speak truth generally do. But these are\r\ntrifles, Mr. Premium. What! I know money isn't to be bought without\r\npaying for't!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Well, but what security could you give? You have no land, I\r\nsuppose?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Not a mole-hill, nor a twig, but what's in the bough pots out\r\nof the window!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Nor any stock, I presume?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Nothing but live stock--and that's only a few pointers and\r\nponies. But pray, Mr. Premium, are you acquainted at all with any of my\r\nconnections?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Why, to say the truth, I am.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Then you must know that I have a devilish rich uncle in\r\nthe East Indies, Sir Oliver Surface, from whom I have the greatest\r\nexpectations?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. That you have a wealthy uncle, I have heard; but how your\r\nexpectations will turn out is more, I believe, than you can tell.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Oh, no!--there can be no doubt. They tell me I'm a prodigious\r\nfavourite, and that he talks of leaving me everything.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Indeed! this is the first I've heard of it.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Yes, yes, 'tis just so. Moses knows 'tis true; don't you,\r\nMoses?\r\n\r\nMOSES. Oh, yes! I'll swear to't.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Egad, they'll persuade me presently I'm at Bengal. [Aside.]\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Now I propose, Mr. Premium, if it's agreeable to you, a\r\npost-obit on Sir Oliver's life: though at the same time the old fellow\r\nhas been so liberal to me, that I give you my word, I should be very\r\nsorry to hear that anything had happened to him.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Not more than I should, I assure you. But the bond you\r\nmention happens to be just the worst security you could offer me--for I\r\nmight live to a hundred and never see the principal.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Oh, yes, you would! the moment Sir Oliver dies, you know, you\r\nwould come on me for the money.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Then I believe I should be the most unwelcome dun you ever\r\nhad in your life.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. What! I suppose you're afraid that Sir Oliver is too good a\r\nlife?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. No, indeed I am not; though I have heard he is as hale and\r\nhealthy as any man of his years in Christendom.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. There again, now, you are misinformed. No, no, the climate has\r\nhurt him considerably, poor uncle Oliver. Yes, yes, he breaks apace, I'm\r\ntold--and is so much altered lately that his nearest relations would not\r\nknow him.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. No! Ha! ha! ha! so much altered lately that his nearest\r\nrelations would not know him! Ha! ha! ha! egad--ha! ha! ha!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Ha! ha!--you're glad to hear that, little Premium?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. No, no, I'm not.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Yes, yes, you are--ha! ha! ha!--you know that mends your\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. But I'm told Sir Oliver is coming over; nay, some say he is\r\nactually arrived.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Psha! sure I must know better than you whether he's come or\r\nnot. No, no, rely on't he's at this moment at Calcutta. Isn't he, Moses?\r\n\r\nMOSES. Oh, yes, certainly.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Very true, as you say, you must know better than I, though I\r\nhave it from pretty good authority. Haven't I, Moses?\r\n\r\nMOSES. Yes, most undoubted!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. But, Sir, as I understand you want a few hundreds\r\nimmediately, is there nothing you could dispose of?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. How do you mean?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. For instance, now, I have heard that your father left behind\r\nhim a great quantity of massy old plate.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. O Lud! that's gone long ago. Moses can tell you how better than\r\nI can.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Good lack! all the family race-cups and\r\ncorporation-bowls!--[Aloud.] Then it was also supposed that his library\r\nwas one of the most valuable and compact.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Yes, yes, so it was--vastly too much so for a private\r\ngentleman. For my part, I was always of a communicative disposition, so\r\nI thought it a shame to keep so much knowledge to myself.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Mercy upon me! learning that had run in the family\r\nlike an heir-loom!--[Aloud.] Pray, what has become of the books?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. You must inquire of the auctioneer, Master Premium, for I don't\r\nbelieve even Moses can direct you.\r\n\r\nMOSES. I know nothing of books.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. So, so, nothing of the family property left, I suppose?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Not much, indeed; unless you have a mind to the family\r\npictures. I have got a room full of ancestors above: and if you have a\r\ntaste for old paintings, egad, you shall have 'em a bargain!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Hey! what the devil! sure, you wouldn't sell your\r\nforefathers, would you?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Every man of them, to the best bidder.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. What! your great-uncles and aunts?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Ay, and my great-grandfathers and grandmothers too.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Now I give him up!--[Aloud.] What the plague,\r\nhave you no bowels for your own kindred? Odd's life! do you take me for\r\nShylock in the play, that you would raise money of me on your own flesh\r\nand blood?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Nay, my little broker, don't be angry: what need you care, if\r\nyou have your money's worth?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Well, I'll be the purchaser: I think I can dispose of the\r\nfamily canvas.--[Aside.] Oh, I'll never forgive him this! never!\r\n\r\n     Re-enter CARELESS\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Come, Charles, what keeps you?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. I can't come yet. I'faith, we are going to have a sale above\r\nstairs; here's little Premium will buy all my ancestors!\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Oh, burn your ancestors!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. No, he may do that afterwards, if he pleases. Stay, Careless,\r\nwe want you: egad, you shall be auctioneer--so come along with us.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Oh, have with you, if that's the case. I can handle a hammer\r\nas well as a dice box! Going! going!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Oh, the profligates! [Aside.]\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Come, Moses, you shall be appraiser, if we want one. Gad's\r\nlife, little Premium, you don't seem to like the business?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Oh, yes, I do, vastly! Ha! ha! ha! yes, yes, I think it a\r\nrare joke to sell one's family by auction--ha! ha!--[Aside.] Oh, the\r\nprodigal!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. To be sure! when a man wants money, where the plague should he\r\nget assistance, if he can't make free with his own relations?\r\n\r\n     [Exeunt.]\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. I'll never forgive him; never! never!\r\n\r\n     END OF THE THIRD ACT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT IV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE I.--A Picture Room in CHARLES SURFACE'S House\r\n\r\n     Enter CHARLES, SIR OLIVER, MOSES, and CARELESS\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Walk in, gentlemen, pray walk in;--here they are, the family of\r\nthe Surfaces, up to the Conquest.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. And, in my opinion, a goodly collection.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Ay, ay, these are done in the true spirit of portrait-painting;\r\nno volontiere grace or expression. Not like the works of your modern\r\nRaphaels, who give you the strongest resemblance, yet contrive to make\r\nyour portrait independent of you; so that you may sink the original\r\nand not hurt the picture. No, no; the merit of these is the inveterate\r\nlikeness--all stiff and awkward as the originals, and like nothing in\r\nhuman nature besides.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Ah! we shall never see such figures of men again.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. I hope not. Well, you see, Master Premium, what a domestic\r\ncharacter I am; here I sit of an evening surrounded by my family. But\r\ncome, get to your pulpit, Mr. Auctioneer; here's an old gouty chair of\r\nmy grandfather's will answer the purpose.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Ay, ay, this will do. But, Charles, I haven't a hammer; and\r\nwhat's an auctioneer without his hammer?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Egad, that's true. What parchment have we here? Oh, our\r\ngenealogy in full. [Taking pedigree down.] Here, Careless, you shall\r\nhave no common bit of mahogany, here's the family tree for you,\r\nyou rogue! This shall be your hammer, and now you may knock down my\r\nancestors with their own pedigree.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. What an unnatural rogue!--an ex post facto parricide!\r\n[Aside.]\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Yes, yes, here's a list of your generation indeed;--faith,\r\nCharles, this is the most convenient thing you could have found for the\r\nbusiness, for 'twill not only serve as a hammer, but a catalogue into\r\nthe bargain. Come, begin--A-going, a-going, a-going!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Bravo, Careless! Well, here's my great uncle, Sir Richard\r\nRavelin, a marvellous good general in his day, I assure you. He served\r\nin all the Duke of Marlborough's wars, and got that cut over his eye\r\nat the battle of Malplaquet. What say you, Mr. Premium? look at\r\nhim--there's a hero! not cut out of his feathers, as your modern clipped\r\ncaptains are, but enveloped in wig and regimentals, as a general should\r\nbe. What do you bid?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. [Aside to Moses.] Bid him speak.\r\n\r\nMOSES. Mr. Premium would have you speak.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Why, then, he shall have him for ten pounds, and I'm sure\r\nthat's not dear for a staff-officer.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Heaven deliver me! his famous uncle Richard for ten\r\npounds!--[Aloud.] Very well, sir, I take him at that.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Careless, knock down my uncle Richard.--Here, now, is a maiden\r\nsister of his, my great-aunt Deborah, done by Kneller, in his best\r\nmanner, and esteemed a very formidable likeness. There she is, you see,\r\na shepherdess feeding her flock. You shall have her for five pounds\r\nten--the sheep are worth the money.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. [Aside.] Ah! poor Deborah! a woman who set such a value on\r\nherself!--[Aloud.] Five pounds ten--she's mine.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Knock down my aunt Deborah! Here, now, are two that were a sort\r\nof cousins of theirs.--You see, Moses, these pictures were done some\r\ntime ago, when beaux wore wigs, and the ladies their own hair.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Yes, truly, head-dresses appear to have been a little lower\r\nin those days.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Well, take that couple for the same.\r\n\r\nMOSES. 'Tis a good bargain.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Careless!--This, now, is a grandfather of my mother's, a\r\nlearned judge, well known on the western circuit,--What do you rate him\r\nat, Moses?\r\n\r\nMOSES. Four guineas.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Four guineas! Gad's life, you don't bid me the price of his\r\nwig.--Mr. Premium, you have more respect for the woolsack; do let us\r\nknock his lordship down at fifteen.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. By all means.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Gone!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. And there are two brothers of his, William and Walter Blunt,\r\nEsquires, both members of Parliament, and noted speakers; and, what's\r\nvery extraordinary, I believe, this is the first time they were ever\r\nbought or sold.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. That is very extraordinary, indeed! I'll take them at your\r\nown price, for the honour of Parliament.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Well said, little Premium! I'll knock them down at forty.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Here's a jolly fellow--I don't know what relation, but he was\r\nmayor of Norwich: take him at eight pounds.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. No, no; six will do for the mayor.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Come, make it guineas, and I'll throw you the two aldermen here\r\ninto the bargain.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. They're mine.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Careless, knock down the mayor and aldermen. But, plague on't!\r\nwe shall be all day retailing in this manner; do let us deal wholesale:\r\nwhat say you, little Premium? Give me three hundred pounds for the rest\r\nof the family in the lump.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Ay, ay, that will be the best way.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Well, well, anything to accommodate you; they are mine. But\r\nthere is one portrait which you have always passed over.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. What, that ill-looking little fellow over the settee?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Yes, sir, I mean that; though I don't think him so\r\nill-looking a little fellow, by any means.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. What, that? Oh; that's my uncle Oliver! 'Twas done before he\r\nwent to India.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Your uncle Oliver! Gad, then you'll never be friends,\r\nCharles. That, now, to me, is as stern a looking rogue as ever I saw; an\r\nunforgiving eye, and a damned disinheriting countenance! an inveterate\r\nknave, depend on't. Don't you think so, little Premium?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Upon my soul, Sir, I do not; I think it is as honest a\r\nlooking face as any in the room, dead or alive. But I suppose uncle\r\nOliver goes with the rest of the lumber?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. No, hang it! I'll not part with poor Noll. The old fellow has\r\nbeen very good to me, and, egad, I'll keep his picture while I've a room\r\nto put it in.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. [Aside.] The rogue's my nephew after all!--[Aloud.] But,\r\nsir, I have somehow taken a fancy to that picture.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. I'm sorry for't, for you certainly will not have it. Oons,\r\nhaven't you got enough of them?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. [Aside.] I forgive him everything!--[Aloud.] But, Sir, when\r\nI take a whim in my head, I don't value money. I'll give you as much for\r\nthat as for all the rest.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Don't tease me, master broker; I tell you I'll not part with\r\nit, and there's an end of it.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. [Aside.] How like his father the dog is.--[Aloud.] Well,\r\nwell, I have done.--[Aside.] I did not perceive it before, but I think\r\nI never saw such a striking resemblance.--[Aloud.] Here is a draught for\r\nyour sum.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Why, 'tis for eight hundred pounds!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. You will not let Sir Oliver go?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Zounds! no! I tell you, once more.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Then never mind the difference, we'll balance that another\r\ntime. But give me your hand on the bargain; you are an honest fellow,\r\nCharles--I beg pardon, sir, for being so free.--Come, Moses.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Egad, this is a whimsical old fellow!--But hark'ee, Premium,\r\nyou'll prepare lodgings for these gentlemen.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Yes, yes, I'll send for them in a day or two.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. But, hold; do now send a genteel conveyance for them, for, I\r\nassure you, they were most of them used to ride in their own carriages.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. I will, I will--for all but Oliver.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Ay, all but the little nabob.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. You're fixed on that?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Peremptorily.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. [Aside.] A dear extravagant rogue!--[Aloud.] Good day! Come,\r\nMoses.--[Aside.] Let me hear now who dares call him profligate!\r\n\r\n     [Exit with MOSES.]\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Why, this is the oddest genius of the sort I ever met with!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Egad, he's the prince of brokers, I think. I wonder how\r\nthe devil Moses got acquainted with so honest a fellow.--Ha! here's\r\nRowley.--Do, Careless, say I'll join the company in a few moments.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. I will--but don't let that old blockhead persuade you to\r\nsquander any of that money on old musty debts, or any such nonsense; for\r\ntradesmen, Charles, are the most exorbitant fellows.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Very true, and paying them is only encouraging them.\r\n\r\nCARELESS. Nothing else.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Ay, ay, never fear.--\r\n\r\n     [Exit CARELESS.]\r\nSo! this was an odd old fellow, indeed. Let me see, two-thirds of these\r\nfive hundred and thirty odd pounds are mine by right. Fore Heaven!\r\nI find one's ancestors are more valuable relations than I took them\r\nfor!--Ladies and gentlemen, your most obedient and very grateful\r\nservant.     [Bows ceremoniously to the pictures.]\r\n\r\n     Enter ROWLEY\r\n\r\nHa! old Rowley! egad, you are just come in time to take leave of your\r\nold acquaintance.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Yes, I heard they were a-going. But I wonder you can have such\r\nspirits under so many distresses.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Why, there's the point! my distresses are so many, that I can't\r\naffort to part with my spirits; but I shall be rich and splenetic, all\r\nin good time. However, I suppose you are surprised that I am not more\r\nsorrowful at parting with so many near relations; to be sure, 'tis very\r\naffecting; but you see they never move a muscle, so why should I?\r\n\r\nROWLEY. There's no making you serious a moment.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Yes, faith, I am so now. Here, my honest Rowley, here, get me\r\nthis changed directly, and take a hundred pounds of it immediately to\r\nold Stanley.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. A hundred pounds! Consider only----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Gad's life, don't talk about it! poor Stanley's wants are\r\npressing, and, if you don't make haste, we shall have some one call that\r\nhas a better right to the money.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Ah! there's the point! I never will cease dunning you with the\r\nold proverb----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. BE JUST BEFORE YOU'RE GENEROUS.--Why, so I would if I could;\r\nbut Justice is an old hobbling beldame, and I can't get her to keep pace\r\nwith Generosity, for the soul of me.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Yet, Charles, believe me, one hour's reflection----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Ay, ay, it's very true; but, hark'ee, Rowley, while I have, by\r\nHeaven I'll give; so, damn your economy! and now for hazard.\r\n\r\n     [Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.--The Parlour\r\n\r\n     Enter SIR OLIVER and MOSES\r\n\r\nMOSES. Well sir, I think as Sir Peter said you have seen Mr. Charles in\r\nhigh Glory--'tis great Pity He's so extravagant.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. True--but he would not sell my Picture--\r\n\r\nMOSES. And loves wine and women so much--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. But He wouldn't sell my Picture.\r\n\r\nMOSES. And game so deep--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. But He wouldn't sell my Picture. O--here's Rowley!\r\n\r\n     Enter ROWLEY\r\n\r\nROWLEY. So--Sir Oliver--I find you have made a Purchase----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Yes--yes--our young Rake has parted with his Ancestors like\r\nold Tapestry--sold Judges and Generals by the foot--and maiden Aunts as\r\ncheap as broken China.--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. And here has he commissioned me to re-deliver you Part of\r\nthe purchase-money--I mean tho' in your necessitous character of old\r\nStanley----\r\n\r\nMOSES. Ah! there is the Pity of all! He is so damned charitable.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. And I left a Hosier and two Tailors in the Hall--who I'm sure\r\nwon't be paid, and this hundred would satisfy 'em.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Well--well--I'll pay his debts and his Benevolences\r\ntoo--I'll take care of old Stanley--myself--But now I am no more\r\na Broker, and you shall introduce me to the elder Brother as Stanley----\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Not yet a while--Sir Peter I know means to call there about this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n     Enter TRIP\r\n\r\nTRIP. O Gentlemen--I beg Pardon for not showing you out--this\r\nway--Moses, a word.\r\n\r\n     [Exit TRIP with MOSES.]\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. There's a Fellow for you--Would you believe it that Puppy\r\nintercepted the Jew, on our coming, and wanted to raise money before he\r\ngot to his master!\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Indeed!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Yes--they are now planning an annuity Business--Ah Master\r\nRowley[,] in my Day Servants were content with the Follies of their\r\nMasters when they were worn a little Thread Bare but now they have their\r\nVices like their Birth Day cloaths with the gloss on.\r\n\r\n     [Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.--A Library\r\n\r\n     SURFACE and SERVANT\r\n\r\nSURFACE. No letter from Lady Teazle?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. No Sir--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. I am surprised she hasn't sent if she is prevented from\r\ncoming--! Sir Peter certainly does not suspect me--yet I wish I may\r\nnot lose the Heiress, thro' the scrape I have drawn myself in with the\r\nwife--However, Charles's imprudence and bad character are great Points\r\nin my Favour.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Sir--I believe that must be Lady Teazle--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Hold[!] see--whether it is or not before you go to the Door--I\r\nhave a particular Message for you if it should be my Brother.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. 'Tis her ladyship Sir--She always leaves her Chair at the\r\nmilliner's in the next Street.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Stay--stay--draw that Screen before the Window--that will\r\ndo--my opposite Neighbour is a maiden Lady of so curious a temper!--\r\n\r\n     [SERVANT draws the screen and exit.]\r\n\r\nI have a difficult Hand to play in this Affair--Lady Teazle as lately\r\nsuspected my Views on Maria--but She must by no means be let into that\r\nsecret, at least till I have her more in my Power.\r\n\r\n     Enter LADY TEAZLE\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. What[!] Sentiment in soliloquy--have you been very\r\nimpatient now?--O Lud! don't pretend to look grave--I vow I couldn't\r\ncome before----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. O Madam[,] Punctuality is a species of Constancy, a very\r\nunfashionable quality in a Lady.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Upon my word you ought to pity me, do you now Sir Peter\r\nis grown so ill-tempered to me of Late! and so jealous! of Charles too\r\nthat's the best of the story isn't it?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. I am glad my scandalous Friends keep that up. [Aside.]\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. I am sure I wish He would let Maria marry him--and then\r\nperhaps He would be convinced--don't you--Mr. Surface?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Indeed I do not.--[Aside.] O certainly I do--for then my dear\r\nLady Teazle would also be convinced how wrong her suspicions were of my\r\nhaving any design on the silly Girl----\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Well--well I'm inclined to believe you--besides I really\r\nnever could perceive why she should have so any admirers.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. O for her Fortune--nothing else--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. I believe so for tho' she is certainly very pretty--yet she\r\nhas no conversation in the world--and is so grave and reserved--that I\r\ndeclare I think she'd have made an excellent wife for Sir Peter.--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. So she would.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Then--one never hears her speak ill of anybody--which you\r\nknow is mighty dull--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Yet she doesn't want understanding--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. No more she does--yet one is always disapointed when\r\none hears [her] speak--For though her Eyes have no kind of meaning in\r\nthem--she very seldom talks Nonsense.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Nay--nay surely--she has very fine eyes--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Why so she has--tho' sometimes one fancies there's a little\r\nsort of a squint--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. A squint--O fie--Lady Teazle.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Yes yes--I vow now--come there is a left-handed Cupid in\r\none eye--that's the Truth on't.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Well--his aim is very direct however--but Lady Sneerwell has\r\nquite corrupted you.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. No indeed--I have not opinion enough of her to be taught\r\nby her, and I know that she has lately rais'd many scandalous hints of\r\nme--which you know one always hears from one common Friend, or other.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Why to say truth I believe you are not more obliged to her than\r\nothers of her acquaintance.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. But isn't [it] provoking to hear the most ill-natured\r\nThings said to one and there's my friend Lady Sneerwell has circulated\r\nI don't know how many scandalous tales of me, and all without any\r\nfoundation, too; that's what vexes me.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Aye Madam to be sure that is the Provoking\r\ncircumstance--without Foundation--yes yes--there's the mortification\r\nindeed--for when a slanderous story is believed against one--there\r\ncertainly is no comfort like the consciousness of having deserved it----\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. No to be sure--then I'd forgive their malice--but to attack\r\nme, who am really so innocent--and who never say an ill-natured thing of\r\nanybody--that is, of any Friend--! and then Sir Peter too--to have\r\nhim so peevish--and so suspicious--when I know the integrity of my own\r\nHeart--indeed 'tis monstrous.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. But my dear Lady Teazle 'tis your own fault if you suffer\r\nit--when a Husband entertains a groundless suspicion of his Wife and\r\nwithdraws his confidence from her--the original compact is broke and she\r\nowes it to the Honour of her sex to endeavour to outwit him--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Indeed--So that if He suspects me without cause it follows\r\nthat the best way of curing his jealousy is to give him reason for't--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Undoubtedly--for your Husband [should] never be deceived in\r\nyou--and in that case it becomes you to be frail in compliment to his\r\ndiscernment--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. To be sure what you say is very reasonable--and when the\r\nconsciousness of my own Innocence----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Ah: my dear--Madam there is the great mistake--'tis this very\r\nconscious Innocence that is of the greatest Prejudice to you--what is\r\nit makes you negligent of Forms and careless of the world's opinion--why\r\nthe consciousness of your Innocence--what makes you thoughtless in\r\nyour Conduct and apt to run into a thousand little imprudences--why the\r\nconsciousness of your Innocence--what makes you impatient of Sir Peter's\r\ntemper, and outrageous at his suspicions--why the consciousness of your\r\nown Innocence--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. 'Tis very true.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Now my dear Lady Teazle if you but once make a trifling Faux\r\nPas you can't conceive how cautious you would grow, and how ready to\r\nhumour and agree with your Husband.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Do you think so--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. O I'm sure on't; and then you'd find all scandal would cease\r\nat once--for in short your Character at Present is like a Person in a\r\nPlethora, absolutely dying of too much Health--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. So--so--then I perceive your Prescription is that I\r\nmust sin in my own Defence--and part with my virtue to preserve my\r\nReputation.--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Exactly so upon my credit Ma'am[.]\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Well certainly this is the oddest Doctrine--and the newest\r\nReceipt for avoiding calumny.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. An infallible one believe me--Prudence like experience must be\r\npaid for--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Why if my understanding were once convinced----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Oh, certainly Madam, your understanding SHOULD be\r\nconvinced--yes--yes--Heaven forbid I should persuade you to do anything\r\nyou THOUGHT wrong--no--no--I have too much honor to desire it--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Don't--you think we may as well leave Honor out of the\r\nArgument? [Rises.]\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Ah--the ill effects of your country education I see still\r\nremain with you.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. I doubt they do indeed--and I will fairly own to you,\r\nthat If I could be persuaded to do wrong it would be by Sir Peter's\r\nill-usage--sooner than your honourable Logic, after all.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Then by this Hand, which He is unworthy of----\r\n\r\n     Enter SERVANT\r\n\r\nSdeath, you Blockhead--what do you want?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. I beg your Pardon Sir, but I thought you wouldn't chuse Sir\r\nPeter to come up without announcing him?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Sir Peter--Oons--the Devil!\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Sir Peter! O Lud! I'm ruined! I'm ruin'd!\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Sir, 'twasn't I let him in.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. O I'm undone--what will become of me now Mr. Logick.--Oh!\r\nmercy, He's on the Stairs--I'll get behind here--and if ever I'm so\r\nimprudent again----\r\n\r\n     [Goes behind the screen--]\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Give me that--Book!----\r\n\r\n     [Sits down--SERVANT pretends to adjust his Hair--]\r\n\r\n     Enter SIR PETER\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Aye--ever improving himself!--Mr. Surface--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Oh! my dear Sir Peter--I beg your Pardon--[Gaping and throws\r\naway the Book.] I have been dosing [dozing] over a stupid Book! well--I\r\nam much obliged to you for this Call--You haven't been here I believe\r\nsince I fitted up this Room--Books you know are the only Things I am a\r\nCoxcomb in--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. 'Tis very neat indeed--well well that's proper--and you make\r\neven your Screen a source of knowledge--hung I perceive with Maps--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. O yes--I find great use in that Screen.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. I dare say you must--certainly--when you want to find out\r\nanything in a Hurry.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Aye or to hide anything in a Hurry either--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Well I have a little private Business--if we were alone--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. You needn't stay.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. No--Sir----\r\n\r\n     [Exit SERVANT.]\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Here's a Chair--Sir Peter--I beg----\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Well--now we are alone--there IS a subject--my dear\r\nFriend--on which I wish to unburthen my Mind to you--a Point of the\r\ngreatest moment to my Peace--in short, my good Friend--Lady Teazle's\r\nconduct of late has made me very unhappy.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Indeed I'm very sorry to hear it--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes 'tis but too plain she has not the least regard for\r\nme--but what's worse, I have pretty good Authority to suspect that she\r\nmust have formed an attachment to another.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Indeed! you astonish me.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes--and between ourselves--I think I have discover'd the\r\nPerson.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. How--you alarm me exceedingly!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Ah: my dear Friend I knew you would sympathize with me.--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Yes--believe me Sir Peter--such a discovery would hurt me just\r\nas much as it would you--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. I am convinced of it--ah--it is a happiness to have a Friend\r\nwhom one can trust even with one's Family secrets--but have you no guess\r\nwho I mean?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. I haven't the most distant Idea--it can't be Sir Benjamin\r\nBackbite.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. O--No. What say you to Charles?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. My Brother--impossible!--O no Sir Peter you mustn't credit the\r\nscandalous insinuations you hear--no no--Charles to be sure has been\r\ncharged with many things but go I can never think He would meditate so\r\ngross an injury--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Ah! my dear Friend--the goodness of your own Heart misleads\r\nyou--you judge of others by yourself.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Certainly Sir Peter--the Heart that is conscious of its own\r\nintegrity is ever slowest to credit another's Treachery.--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. True--but your Brother has no sentiment[--]you never hear him\r\ntalk so.--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Well there certainly is no knowing what men are capable\r\nof--no--there is no knowing--yet I can't but think Lady Teazle herself\r\nhas too much Principle----\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Aye but what's Principle against the Flattery of a\r\nhandsome--lively young Fellow--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. That's very true--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. And then you know the difference of our ages makes it very\r\nimprobable that she should have any great affection for me--and if she\r\nwere to be frail and I were to make it Public--why the Town would only\r\nlaugh at the foolish old Batchelor, who had married a girl----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. That's true--to be sure People would laugh.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Laugh--aye and make Ballads--and Paragraphs and the Devil\r\nknows what of me--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. No--you must never make it public--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. But then again that the Nephew of my old Friend, Sir\r\nOliver[,] should be the Person to attempt such an injury--hurts me more\r\nnearly--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Undoubtedly--when Ingratitude barbs the Dart of Injury--the\r\nwound has double danger in it--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Aye--I that was in a manner left his Guardian--in his House\r\nhe had been so often entertain'd--who never in my Life denied him my\r\nadvice--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. O 'tis not to be credited--There may be a man capable of such\r\nBaseness, to be sure--but for my Part till you can give me positive\r\nProofs you must excuse me withholding my Belief. However, if this should\r\nbe proved on him He is no longer a brother of mine I disclaim kindred\r\nwith him--for the man who can break thro' the Laws of Hospitality--and\r\nattempt the wife of his Friend deserves to be branded as the Pest of\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. What a difference there is between you--what noble\r\nsentiments!--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. But I cannot suspect Lady Teazle's honor.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. I'm sure I wish to think well of her--and to remove all\r\nground of Quarrel between us--She has lately reproach'd me more than\r\nonce with having made no settlement on her--and, in our last Quarrel,\r\nshe almost hinted that she should not break her Heart if I was\r\ndead.--now as we seem to differ in our Ideas of Expense I have resolved\r\nshe shall be her own Mistress in that Respect for the future--and if\r\nI were to die--she shall find that I have not been inattentive to her\r\nInterests while living--Here my Friend are the Draughts of two Deeds\r\nwhich I wish to have your opinion on--by one she will enjoy eight\r\nhundred a year independent while I live--and by the other the bulk of my\r\nFortune after my Death.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. This conduct Sir Peter is indeed truly Generous! I wish it may\r\nnot corrupt my pupil.--[Aside.]\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes I am determined she shall have no cause to complain--tho'\r\nI would not have her acquainted with the latter instance of my affection\r\nyet awhile.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Nor I--if I could help it.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. And now my dear Friend if you please we will talk over the\r\nsituation of your Hopes with Maria.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. No--no--Sir Peter--another Time if you Please--[softly].\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. I am sensibly chagrined at the little Progress you seem to\r\nmake in her affection.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. I beg you will not mention it--What are my Disappointments when\r\nyour Happiness is in Debate [softly]. 'Sdeath I shall be ruined every\r\nway.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. And tho' you are so averse to my acquainting Lady Teazle with\r\nYOUR passion, I am sure she's not your Enemy in the Affair.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Pray Sir Peter, now oblige me.--I am really too much affected\r\nby the subject we have been speaking of to bestow a thought on my own\r\nconcerns--The Man who is entrusted with his Friend's Distresses can\r\nnever----\r\n\r\n     Enter SERVANT\r\n\r\nWell, Sir?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Your Brother Sir, is--speaking to a Gentleman in the Street,\r\nand says He knows you're within.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. 'Sdeath, Blockhead--I'm NOT within--I'm out for the Day.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Stay--hold--a thought has struck me--you shall be at home.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Well--well--let him up.--\r\n\r\n     [Exit SERVANT.]\r\n\r\nHe'll interrupt Sir Peter, however. [Aside.]\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Now, my good Friend--oblige me I Intreat you--before Charles\r\ncomes--let me conceal myself somewhere--Then do you tax him on the Point\r\nwe have been talking on--and his answers may satisfy me at once.--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. O Fie--Sir Peter--would you have ME join in so mean a Trick? to\r\ntrepan my Brother too?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Nay you tell me you are SURE He is innocent--if so you do\r\nhim the greatest service in giving him an opportunity to clear\r\nhimself--and--you will set my Heart at rest--come you shall not refuse\r\nme--here behind this Screen will be--hey! what the Devil--there seems to\r\nbe one listener here already--I'll swear I saw a Petticoat.--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Ha! ha! ha! Well this is ridiculous enough--I'll tell you,\r\nSir Peter--tho' I hold a man of Intrigue to be a most despicable\r\nCharacter--yet you know it doesn't follow that a man is to be an\r\nabsolute Joseph either--hark'ee--'tis a little French Milliner--a silly\r\nRogue that plagues me--and having some character, on your coming she ran\r\nbehind the Screen.--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Ah a Rogue--but 'egad she has overheard all I have been\r\nsaying of my Wife.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. O 'twill never go any farther, you may depend on't.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. No!--then efaith let her hear it out.--Here's a Closet will\r\ndo as well.--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Well, go in there.--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Sly rogue--sly Rogue.--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Gad's my Life what an Escape--! and a curious situation I'm\r\nin!--to part man and wife in this manner.--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. [peeps out.] Couldn't I steal off--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Keep close, my Angel!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. [Peeping out.] Joseph--tax him home.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Back--my dear Friend\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. [Peeping out.] Couldn't you lock Sir Peter in?--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Be still--my Life!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. [Peeping.] You're sure the little Milliner won't blab?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. In! in! my good Sir Peter--'Fore Gad, I wish I had a key to the\r\nDoor.\r\n\r\n     Enter CHARLES\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Hollo! Brother--what has been the matter? your Fellow wouldn't\r\nlet me up at first--What[?] have you had a Jew or a wench with you.--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Neither Brother I assure you.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. But--what has made Sir Peter steal off--I thought He had been\r\nwith you--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. He WAS Brother--but hearing you were coming He didn't chuse to\r\nstay--\r\n\r\nCHARLES. What[!] was the old Gentleman afraid I wanted to borrow money\r\nof him?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. No Sir--but I am sorry to find[,] Charles--you have lately\r\ngiven that worthy man grounds for great Uneasiness.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Yes they tell me I do that to a great many worthy men--but how\r\nso Pray?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. To be plain with you Brother He thinks you are endeavouring to\r\ngain Lady Teazle's Affections from him.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Who I--O Lud! not I upon my word.--Ha! ha! ha! so the old\r\nFellow has found out that He has got a young wife has He? or what's\r\nworse she has discover'd that she has an old Husband?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. This is no subject to jest on Brother--He who can laugh----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. True true as you were going to say--then seriously I never had\r\nthe least idea of what you charge me with, upon my honour.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Well it will give Sir Peter great satisfaction to hear this.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. [Aloud.] To be sure, I once thought the lady seemed to\r\nhave taken a fancy--but upon my soul I never gave her the least\r\nencouragement.--Beside you know my Attachment to Maria--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. But sure Brother even if Lady Teazle had betray'd the fondest\r\nPartiality for you----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Why--look'ee Joseph--I hope I shall never deliberately do\r\na dishonourable Action--but if a pretty woman was purposely to throw\r\nherself in my way--and that pretty woman married to a man old enough to\r\nbe her Father----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Well?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Why I believe I should be obliged to borrow a little of your\r\nMorality, that's all.--but, Brother do you know now that you surprize me\r\nexceedingly by naming me with Lady Teazle--for faith I always understood\r\nYOU were her Favourite--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. O for shame--Charles--This retort is Foolish.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Nay I swear I have seen you exchange such significant\r\nGlances----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Nay--nay--Sir--this is no jest--\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Egad--I'm serious--Don't you remember--one Day, when I called\r\nhere----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Nay--prithee--Charles\r\n\r\nCHARLES. And found you together----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Zounds, Sir--I insist----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. And another time when your Servant----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Brother--brother a word with you--Gad I must stop him--[Aside.]\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Informed--me that----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Hush!--I beg your Pardon but Sir Peter has overheard all we\r\nhave been saying--I knew you would clear yourself, or I shouldn't have\r\nconsented--\r\n\r\nCHARLES. How Sir Peter--Where is He--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Softly, there! [Points to the closet.]\r\n\r\nCHARLES. [In the Closet!] O 'fore Heaven I'll have him out--Sir Peter\r\ncome forth!\r\n\r\nSURFACE. No--no----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. I say Sir Peter--come into court.--\r\n\r\n     [Pulls in SIR PETER.]\r\n\r\nWhat--my old Guardian--what[!] turn inquisitor and take evidence\r\nincog.--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Give me your hand--Charles--I believe I have suspected you\r\nwrongfully; but you mustn't be angry with Joseph--'twas my Plan--\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Indeed!--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. But I acquit you--I promise you I don't think near so ill of\r\nyou as I did--what I have heard has given me great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Egad then 'twas lucky you didn't hear any more. Wasn't it\r\nJoseph?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Ah! you would have retorted on him.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Aye--aye--that was a Joke.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes, yes, I know his honor too well.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Yet you might as well have suspected him as me in this matter,\r\nfor all that--mightn't He, Joseph?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Well well I believe you--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Would they were both out of the Room!\r\n\r\n     Enter SERVANT, whispers SURFACE\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. And in future perhaps we may not be such Strangers.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Gentlemen--I beg Pardon--I must wait on you downstairs--Here is\r\na Person come on particular Business----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Well you can see him in another Room--Sir Peter and I haven't\r\nmet a long time and I have something to say [to] him.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. They must not be left together.--I'll send this man away and\r\nreturn directly--\r\n\r\n     [SURFACE goes out.]\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Ah--Charles if you associated more with your Brother, one\r\nmight indeed hope for your reformation--He is a man of Sentiment--Well!\r\nthere is nothing in the world so noble as a man of Sentiment!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Pshaw! He is too moral by half--and so apprehensive of his good\r\nName, as he calls it, that I suppose He would as soon let a Priest in\r\nhis House as a Girl--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. No--no--come come,--you wrong him. No, no, Joseph is no Rake\r\nbut he is no such Saint in that respect either. I have a great mind to\r\ntell him--we should have such a Laugh!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Oh, hang him? He's a very Anchorite--a young Hermit!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Harkee--you must not abuse him, he may chance to hear of it\r\nagain I promise you.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Why you won't tell him?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. No--but--this way. Egad, I'll tell him--Harkee, have you a\r\nmind to have a good laugh against Joseph?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. I should like it of all things--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Then, E'faith, we will--I'll be quit with him for discovering\r\nme.--He had a girl with him when I called. [Whispers.]\r\n\r\nCHARLES. What[!] Joseph[!] you jest--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Hush!--a little French Milliner--and the best of the jest\r\nis--she's in the room now.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. The devil she is--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Hush! I tell you. [Points.]\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Behind the screen! Odds Life, let's unveil her!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. No--no! He's coming--you shan't indeed!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Oh, egad, we'll have a peep at the little milliner!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Not for the world--Joseph will never forgive me.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. I'll stand by you----\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Odds Life! Here He's coming--\r\n\r\n     [SURFACE enters just as CHARLES throws down the Screen.]\r\n\r\n     Re-enter JOSEPH SURFACE\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Lady Teazle! by all that's wonderful!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Lady Teazle! by all that's Horrible!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Sir Peter--This is one of the smartest French Milliners I ever\r\nsaw!--Egad, you seem all to have been diverting yourselves here at Hide\r\nand Seek--and I don't see who is out of the Secret!--Shall I beg your\r\nLadyship to inform me!--Not a word!--Brother!--will you please to\r\nexplain this matter? What! is Honesty Dumb too?--Sir Peter, though I\r\nfound you in the Dark--perhaps you are not so now--all mute! Well tho'\r\nI can make nothing of the Affair, I make no doubt but you perfectly\r\nunderstand one another--so I'll leave you to yourselves.--[Going.]\r\nBrother I'm sorry to find you have given that worthy man grounds for so\r\nmuch uneasiness!--Sir Peter--there's nothing in the world so noble as a\r\nman of Sentiment!--\r\n\r\n     [Stand for some time looking at one another.  Exit CHARLES.]\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Sir Peter--notwithstanding I confess that appearances are\r\nagainst me. If you will afford me your Patience I make no doubt but I\r\nshall explain everything to your satisfaction.--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. If you please--Sir--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. The Fact is Sir--that Lady Teazle knowing my Pretensions\r\nto your ward Maria--I say Sir Lady Teazle--being apprehensive of the\r\nJealousy of your Temper--and knowing my Friendship to the Family. S\r\nhe Sir--I say call'd here--in order that I might explain those\r\nPretensions--but on your coming being apprehensive--as I said of your\r\nJealousy--she withdrew--and this, you may depend on't is the whole truth\r\nof the Matter.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. A very clear account upon the [my] word and I dare swear the\r\nLady will vouch for every article of it.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. For not one word of it Sir Peter--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. How[!] don't you think it worthwhile to agree in the lie.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. There is not one Syllable of Truth in what that Gentleman\r\nhas told you.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. I believe you upon my soul Ma'am--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. 'Sdeath, madam, will you betray me! [Aside.]\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Good Mr. Hypocrite by your leave I will speak for myself--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Aye let her alone Sir--you'll find she'll make out a better\r\nstory than you without Prompting.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Hear me Sir Peter--I came hither on no matter relating to\r\nyour ward and even ignorant of this Gentleman's pretensions to her--but\r\nI came--seduced by his insidious arguments--and pretended Passion[--]at\r\nleast to listen to his dishonourable Love if not to sacrifice your\r\nHonour to his Baseness.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Now, I believe, the Truth is coming indeed[.]\r\n\r\nSURFACE. The Woman's mad--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. No Sir--she has recovered her Senses. Your own Arts have\r\nfurnished her with the means. Sir Peter--I do not expect you to credit\r\nme--but the Tenderness you express'd for me, when I am sure you could\r\nnot think I was a witness to it, has penetrated so to my Heart that had\r\nI left the Place without the Shame of this discovery--my future\r\nlife should have spoken the sincerity of my Gratitude--as for that\r\nsmooth-tongued Hypocrite--who would have seduced the wife of his too\r\ncredulous Friend while he pretended honourable addresses to his ward--I\r\nbehold him now in a light so truly despicable that I shall never again\r\nRespect myself for having Listened to him.\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Notwithstanding all this Sir Peter--Heaven knows----\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. That you are a Villain!--and so I leave you to your\r\nconscience--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. You are too Rash Sir Peter--you SHALL hear me--The man who\r\nshuts out conviction by refusing to----\r\n\r\n     [Exeunt, SURFACE following and speaking.]\r\n\r\n     END OF THE FOURTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT V\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE I.--The Library\r\n\r\n     Enter SURFACE and SERVANT\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Mr. Stanley! and why should you think I would see him?--you\r\nmust know he came to ask something!\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Sir--I shouldn't have let him in but that Mr. Rowley came to\r\nthe Door with him.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Pshaw!--Blockhead to suppose that I should now be in a Temper\r\nto receive visits from poor Relations!--well why don't you show the\r\nFellow up?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. I will--Sir--Why, Sir--it was not my Fault that Sir Peter\r\ndiscover'd my Lady----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Go, fool!--\r\n\r\n    [Exit SERVANT.]\r\n\r\nSure Fortune never play'd a man of my policy such a Trick before--my\r\ncharacter with Sir Peter!--my Hopes with Maria!--destroy'd in a\r\nmoment!--I'm in a rare Humour to listen to other People's Distresses!--I\r\nshan't be able to bestow even a benevolent sentiment on Stanley--So!\r\nhere--He comes and Rowley with him--I MUST try to recover myself, and\r\nput a little Charity into my Face however.----\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\n     Enter SIR OLIVER and ROWLEY\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. What! does He avoid us? that was He--was it not?\r\n\r\nROWLEY. It was Sir--but I doubt you are come a little too abruptly--his\r\nNerves are so weak that the sight of a poor Relation may be too much for\r\nhim--I should have gone first to break you to him.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. A Plague of his Nerves--yet this is He whom Sir Peter\r\nextolls as a Man of the most Benevolent way of thinking!--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. As to his way of thinking--I can't pretend to decide[,] for, to\r\ndo him justice He appears to have as much speculative Benevolence as any\r\nprivate Gentleman in the Kingdom--though he is seldom so sensual as to\r\nindulge himself in the exercise of it----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Yet [he] has a string of charitable Sentiments I suppose at\r\nhis Fingers' ends!--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Or, rather at his Tongue's end Sir Oliver; for I believe there\r\nis no sentiment he has more faith in than that 'Charity begins at Home.'\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. And his I presume is of that domestic sort which never stirs\r\nabroad at all.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. I doubt you'll find it so--but He's coming--I mustn't seem to\r\ninterrupt you--and you know immediately--as you leave him--I come in to\r\nannounce--your arrival in your real Character.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. True--and afterwards you'll meet me at Sir Peter's----\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Without losing a moment.\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. So--I see he has premeditated a Denial by the Complaisance\r\nof his Features.\r\n\r\n     Enter SURFACE\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Sir--I beg you ten thousand Pardons for keeping--you a moment\r\nwaiting--Mr. Stanley--I presume----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. At your Service.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Sir--I beg you will do me the honour to sit down--I entreat you\r\nSir.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Dear Sir there's no occasion--too civil by half!\r\n\r\nSURFACE. I have not the Pleasure of knowing you, Mr. Stanley--but I am\r\nextremely happy to see you look so well--you were nearly related to my\r\nmother--I think Mr. Stanley----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. I was Sir--so nearly that my present Poverty I fear may do\r\ndiscredit to her Wealthy Children--else I should not have presumed to\r\ntrouble you.--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Dear Sir--there needs no apology--He that is in Distress tho' a\r\nstranger has a right to claim kindred with the wealthy--I am sure I wish\r\nI was of that class, and had it in my power to offer you even a small\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. If your Unkle, Sir Oliver were here--I should have a\r\nFriend----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. I wish He was Sir, with all my Heart--you should not want an\r\nadvocate with him--believe me Sir.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. I should not need one--my Distresses would recommend\r\nme.--but I imagined--his Bounty had enabled you to become the agent of\r\nhis Charity.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. My dear Sir--you are strangely misinformed--Sir Oliver is a\r\nworthy Man, a worthy man--a very worthy sort of Man--but avarice\r\nMr. Stanley is the vice of age--I will tell you my good Sir in\r\nconfidence:--what he has done for me has been a mere--nothing[;] tho'\r\nPeople I know have thought otherwise and for my Part I never chose to\r\ncontradict the Report.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. What!--has he never\r\ntransmitted--you--Bullion--Rupees--Pagodas!\r\n\r\nSURFACE. O Dear Sir--Nothing of the kind--no--no--a few Presents now and\r\nthen--china, shawls, congo Tea, Avadavats--and indian Crackers--little\r\nmore, believe me.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Here's Gratitude for twelve thousand pounds!--Avadavats and\r\nindian Crackers.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Then my dear--Sir--you have heard, I doubt not, of the\r\nextravagance of my Brother--Sir--there are very few would credit what I\r\nhave done for that unfortunate young man.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Not I for one!\r\n\r\nSURFACE. The sums I have lent him! indeed--I have been exceedingly to\r\nblame--it was an amiable weakness! however I don't pretend to defend\r\nit--and now I feel it doubly culpable--since it has deprived me of the\r\npower of serving YOU Mr. Stanley as my Heart directs----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Dissembler! Then Sir--you cannot assist me?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. At Present it grieves me to say I cannot--but whenever I have\r\nthe ability, you may depend upon hearing from me.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. I am extremely sorry----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Not more than I am believe me--to pity without the Power to\r\nrelieve is still more painful than to ask and be denied----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Kind Sir--your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. You leave me deeply affected Mr. Stanley--William--be ready to\r\nopen the door----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. O, Dear Sir, no ceremony----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Your very obedient----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Your most obsequious----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. You may depend on hearing from me whenever I can be of\r\nservice----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Sweet Sir--you are too good----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. In the mean time I wish you Health and Spirits----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Your ever grateful and perpetual humble Servant----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Sir--yours as sincerely----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Charles!--you are my Heir.\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\nSURFACE, solus Soh!--This is one bad effect of a good Character--it\r\ninvites applications from the unfortunate and there needs no small\r\ndegree of address to gain the reputation of Benevolence without\r\nincurring the expence.--The silver ore of pure Charity is an expensive\r\narticle in the catalogue of a man's good Qualities--whereas the\r\nsentimental French Plate I use instead of it makes just as good a\r\nshew--and pays no tax.\r\n\r\n     Enter ROWLEY\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Mr. Surface--your Servant: I was apprehensive of interrupting\r\nyou, tho' my Business demands immediate attention--as this Note will\r\ninform you----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Always Happy to see Mr. Rowley--how--Oliver--Surface!--My Unkle\r\narrived!\r\n\r\nROWLEY. He is indeed--we have just parted--quite well--after a speedy\r\nvoyage--and impatient to embrace his worthy Nephew.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. I am astonished!--William[!] stop Mr. Stanley, if He's not\r\ngone----\r\n\r\nROWLEY. O--He's out of reach--I believe.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Why didn't you let me know this when you came in together.--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. I thought you had particular--Business--but must be gone to\r\ninform your Brother, and appoint him here to meet his Uncle. He will be\r\nwith you in a quarter of an hour----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. So he says. Well--I am strangely overjoy'd at his coming--never\r\nto be sure was anything so damn'd unlucky!\r\n\r\nROWLEY. You will be delighted to see how well He looks.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. O--I'm rejoiced to hear it--just at this time----\r\n\r\nROWLEY. I'll tell him how impatiently you expect him----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Do--do--pray--give my best duty and affection--indeed, I cannot\r\nexpress the sensations I feel at the thought of seeing him!--certainly\r\nhis coming just at this Time is the cruellest piece of ill Fortune----\r\n\r\n     [Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.--At SIR PETER'S House\r\n\r\n     Enter MRS. CANDOUR and SERVANT\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Indeed Ma'am, my Lady will see nobody at Present.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Did you tell her it was her Friend Mrs. Candour----\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Yes Ma'am but she begs you will excuse her----\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Do go again--I shall be glad to see her if it be only for\r\na moment--for I am sure she must be in great Distress\r\n\r\n     [exit MAID]\r\n\r\n--Dear Heart--how provoking!--I'm not mistress of half the\r\ncircumstances!--We shall have the whole affair in the newspapers with\r\nthe Names of the Parties at length before I have dropt the story at a\r\ndozen houses.\r\n\r\n     Enter SIR BENJAMIN\r\n\r\nSir Benjamin you have heard, I suppose----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Of Lady Teazle and Mr. Surface----\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. And Sir Peter's Discovery----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. O the strangest Piece of Business to be sure----\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Well I never was so surprised in my life!--I am so sorry\r\nfor all Parties--indeed,\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Now I don't Pity Sir Peter at all--he was so\r\nextravagant--partial to Mr. Surface----\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Mr. Surface!--why 'twas with Charles Lady Teazle was\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. No such thing Mr. Surface is the gallant.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. No--no--Charles is the man--'twas Mr. Surface brought Sir\r\nPeter on purpose to discover them----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. I tell you I have it from one----\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. And I have it from one----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Who had it from one who had it----\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. From one immediately--but here comes Lady\r\nSneerwell--perhaps she knows the whole affair.\r\n\r\n     Enter LADY SNEERWELL\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. So--my dear Mrs. Candour Here's a sad affair of our\r\nFriend Teazle----\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Aye my dear Friend, who could have thought it.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Well there is no trusting to appearances[;] tho'--indeed\r\nshe was always too lively for me.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. To be sure, her manners were a little too--free--but she\r\nwas very young----\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. And had indeed some good Qualities.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. So she had indeed--but have you heard the Particulars?\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. No--but everybody says that Mr. Surface----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Aye there I told you--Mr. Surface was the Man.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. No--no--indeed the assignation was with Charles----\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. With Charles!--You alarm me Mrs. Candour!\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Yes--yes He was the Lover--Mr. Surface--do him\r\njustice--was only the Informer.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Well I'll not dispute with you Mrs. Candour--but be it\r\nwhich it may--I hope that Sir Peter's wound will not----\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Sir Peter's wound! O mercy! I didn't hear a word of their\r\nFighting----\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Nor I a syllable!\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. No--what no mention of the Duel----\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Not a word--\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. O, Lord--yes--yes--they fought before they left the Room.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Pray let us hear.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Aye--do oblige--us with the Duel----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. 'Sir'--says Sir Peter--immediately after the Discovery,\r\n'you are a most ungrateful Fellow.'\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Aye to Charles----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. No, no--to Mr. Surface--'a most ungrateful Fellow; and old\r\nas I am, Sir,' says He, 'I insist on immediate satisfaction.'\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Aye that must have been to Charles for 'tis very unlikely\r\nMr. Surface should go to fight in his own House.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Gad's Life, Ma'am, not at all--giving me immediate\r\nsatisfaction--on this, Madam--Lady Teazle seeing Sir Peter in such\r\nDanger--ran out of the Room in strong Hysterics--and Charles after her\r\ncalling out for Hartshorn and Water! Then Madam--they began to fight\r\nwith Swords----\r\n\r\n     Enter CRABTREE\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. With Pistols--Nephew--I have it from undoubted authority.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Oh, Mr. Crabtree then it is all true----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Too true indeed Ma'am, and Sir Peter Dangerously wounded----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. By a thrust in second--quite thro' his left side\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. By a Bullet lodged in the Thorax----\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Mercy--on me[!] Poor Sir Peter----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Yes, ma'am tho' Charles would have avoided the matter if he\r\ncould----\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. I knew Charles was the Person----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. O my Unkle I see knows nothing of the matter----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. But Sir Peter tax'd him with the basest ingratitude----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. That I told you, you know----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Do Nephew let me speak--and insisted on immediate----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Just as I said----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Odds life! Nephew allow others to know something too--A Pair\r\nof Pistols lay on the Bureau--for Mr. Surface--it seems, had come home\r\nthe Night before late from Salt-Hill where He had been to see the Montem\r\nwith a Friend, who has a Son at Eton--so unluckily the Pistols were left\r\nCharged----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. I heard nothing of this----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Sir Peter forced Charles to take one and they fired--it seems\r\npretty nearly together--Charles's shot took Place as I tell you--and Sir\r\nPeter's miss'd--but what is very extraordinary the Ball struck against\r\na little Bronze Pliny that stood over the Fire Place--grazed out of the\r\nwindow at a right angle--and wounded the Postman, who was just coming to\r\nthe Door with a double letter from Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. My Unkle's account is more circumstantial I must\r\nconfess--but I believe mine is the true one for all that.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. I am more interested in this Affair than they\r\nimagine--and must have better information.--\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Ah! Lady Sneerwell's alarm is very easily accounted for.--\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Yes yes, they certainly DO say--but that's neither here nor\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. But pray where is Sir Peter at present----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Oh! they--brought him home and He is now in the House, tho'\r\nthe Servants are order'd to deny it----\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. I believe so--and Lady Teazle--I suppose attending him----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Yes yes--and I saw one of the Faculty enter just before me----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Hey--who comes here----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Oh, this is He--the Physician depend on't.\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. O certainly it must be the Physician and now we shall\r\nknow----\r\n\r\n     Enter SIR OLIVER\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Well, Doctor--what Hopes?\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Aye Doctor how's your Patient?\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Now Doctor isn't it a wound with a small sword----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. A bullet lodged in the Thorax--for a hundred!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Doctor!--a wound with a small sword! and a Bullet in the\r\nThorax!--oon's are you mad, good People?\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Perhaps, Sir, you are not a Doctor.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Truly Sir I am to thank you for my degree If I am.\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Only a Friend of Sir Peter's then I presume--but, sir, you\r\nmust have heard of this accident--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Not a word!\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Not of his being dangerously wounded?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. The Devil he is!\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Run thro' the Body----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Shot in the breast----\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. By one Mr. Surface----\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Aye the younger.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Hey! what the plague! you seem to differ strangely in your\r\naccounts--however you agree that Sir Peter is dangerously wounded.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. Oh yes, we agree in that.\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Yes, yes, I believe there can be no doubt in that.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Then, upon my word, for a person in that Situation, he is\r\nthe most imprudent man alive--For here he comes walking as if nothing at\r\nall was the matter.\r\n\r\n     Enter SIR PETER\r\n\r\nOdd's heart, sir Peter! you are come in good time I promise you, for we\r\nhad just given you over!\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. 'Egad, Uncle this is the most sudden Recovery!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Why, man, what do you do out of Bed with a Small Sword\r\nthrough your Body, and a Bullet lodg'd in your Thorax?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. A Small Sword and a Bullet--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Aye these Gentlemen would have kill'd you without Law or\r\nPhysic, and wanted to dub me a Doctor to make me an accomplice.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Why! what is all this?\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. We rejoice, Sir Peter, that the Story of the Duel is not\r\ntrue--and are sincerely sorry for your other Misfortune.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. So--so--all over the Town already! [Aside.]\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. Tho', Sir Peter, you were certainly vastly to blame to marry\r\nat all at your years.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Sir, what Business is that of yours?\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Tho' Indeed, as Sir Peter made so good a Husband, he's\r\nvery much to be pitied.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Plague on your pity, Ma'am, I desire none of it.\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. However Sir Peter, you must not mind the Laughing and\r\njests you will meet with on the occasion.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Sir, I desire to be master in my own house.\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. 'Tis no Uncommon Case, that's one comfort.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. I insist on being left to myself, without ceremony,--I insist\r\non your leaving my house directly!\r\n\r\nMRS. CANDOUR. Well, well, we are going and depend on't, we'll make the\r\nbest report of you we can.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Leave my house!\r\n\r\nCRABTREE. And tell how hardly you have been treated.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Leave my House--\r\n\r\nSIR BENJAMIN. And how patiently you bear it.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Friends! Vipers! Furies! Oh that their own Venom would choke\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. They are very provoking indeed, Sir Peter.\r\n\r\n     Enter ROWLEY\r\n\r\nROWLEY. I heard high words: what has ruffled you Sir Peter--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Pshaw what signifies asking--do I ever pass a Day without my\r\nVexations?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Well I'm not Inquisitive--I come only to tell you, that I\r\nhave seen both my Nephews in the manner we proposed.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. A Precious Couple they are!\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Yes and Sir Oliver--is convinced that your judgment was right\r\nSir Peter.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Yes I find Joseph is Indeed the Man after all.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Aye as Sir Peter says, He's a man of Sentiment.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. And acts up to the Sentiments he professes.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. It certainly is Edification to hear him talk.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Oh, He's a model for the young men of the age! But how's\r\nthis, Sir Peter? you don't Join us in your Friend Joseph's Praise as I\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Sir Oliver, we live in a damned wicked world, and the fewer\r\nwe praise the better.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. What do YOU say so, Sir Peter--who were never mistaken in your\r\nLife?\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Pshaw--Plague on you both--I see by your sneering you have\r\nheard--the whole affair--I shall go mad among you!\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Then to fret you no longer Sir Peter--we are indeed acquainted\r\nwith it all--I met Lady Teazle coming from Mr. Surface's so humbled,\r\nthat she deigned to request ME to be her advocate with you--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. And does Sir Oliver know all too?\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Every circumstance!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. What of the closet and the screen--hey[?]\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Yes yes--and the little French Milliner. Oh, I have been\r\nvastly diverted with the story! ha! ha! ha!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. 'Twas very pleasant!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. I never laugh'd more in my life, I assure you: ha! ha!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. O vastly diverting! ha! ha!\r\n\r\nROWLEY. To be sure Joseph with his Sentiments! ha! ha!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes his sentiments! ha! ha! a hypocritical Villain!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Aye and that Rogue Charles--to pull Sir Peter out of the\r\ncloset: ha! ha!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Ha! ha! 'twas devilish entertaining to be sure--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Ha! ha! Egad, Sir Peter I should like to have seen your Face\r\nwhen the screen was thrown down--ha! ha!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Yes, my face when the Screen was thrown down: ha! ha! ha! O I\r\nmust never show my head again!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. But come--come it isn't fair to laugh at you neither my old\r\nFriend--tho' upon my soul I can't help it--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. O pray don't restrain your mirth on my account: it does not\r\nhurt me at all--I laugh at the whole affair myself--Yes--yes--I\r\nthink being a standing Jest for all one's acquaintance a very happy\r\nsituation--O yes--and then of a morning to read the Paragraphs about\r\nMr. S----, Lady T----, and Sir P----, will be so entertaining!--I shall\r\ncertainly leave town tomorrow and never look mankind in the Face again!\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Without affectation Sir Peter, you may despise the ridicule of\r\nFools--but I see Lady Teazle going towards the next Room--I am sure you\r\nmust desire a Reconciliation as earnestly as she does.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Perhaps MY being here prevents her coming to you--well I'll\r\nleave honest Rowley to mediate between you; but he must bring you all\r\npresently to Mr. Surface's--where I am now returning--if not to reclaim\r\na Libertine, at least to expose Hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Ah! I'll be present at your discovering yourself there with\r\nall my heart; though 'tis a vile unlucky Place for discoveries.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. However it is very convenient to the carrying on of my Plot\r\nthat you all live so near one another!\r\n\r\n     [Exit SIR OLIVER.]\r\n\r\nROWLEY. We'll follow--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. She is not coming here you see, Rowley--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. No but she has left the Door of that Room open you\r\nperceive.--see she is in Tears--!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. She seems indeed to wish I should go to her.--how dejected\r\nshe appears--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. And will you refrain from comforting her--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Certainly a little mortification appears very becoming in a\r\nwife--don't you think it will do her good to let her Pine a little.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. O this is ungenerous in you--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Well I know not what to think--you remember Rowley the Letter\r\nI found of her's--evidently intended for Charles?\r\n\r\nROWLEY. A mere forgery, Sir Peter--laid in your way on Purpose--this is\r\none of the Points which I intend Snake shall give you conviction on--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. I wish I were once satisfied of that--She looks this\r\nway----what a remarkably elegant Turn of the Head she has! Rowley I'll\r\ngo to her--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Certainly--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Tho' when it is known that we are reconciled, People will\r\nlaugh at me ten times more!\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Let--them laugh--and retort their malice only by showing them\r\nyou are happy in spite of it.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Efaith so I will--and, if I'm not mistaken we may yet be the\r\nhappiest couple in the country--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Nay Sir Peter--He who once lays aside suspicion----\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Hold Master Rowley--if you have any Regard for me--never let\r\nme hear you utter anything like a Sentiment. I have had enough of THEM\r\nto serve me the rest of my Life.\r\n\r\n     [Exeunt.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE THE LAST.--The Library\r\n\r\n     SURFACE and LADY SNEERWELL\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Impossible! will not Sir Peter immediately be reconciled\r\nto CHARLES? and of consequence no longer oppose his union with MARIA?\r\nthe thought is Distraction to me!\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Can Passion--furnish a Remedy?\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. No--nor cunning either. O I was a Fool, an Ideot--to\r\nleague with such a Blunderer!\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Surely Lady Sneerwell I am the greatest Sufferer--yet you see I\r\nbear the accident with Calmness.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Because the Disappointment hasn't reached your\r\nHEART--your interest only attached you to Maria--had you felt for\r\nher--what I have for that ungrateful Libertine--neither your Temper nor\r\nHypocrisy could prevent your showing the sharpness of your Vexation.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. But why should your Reproaches fall on me for this\r\nDisappointment?\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Are not you the cause of it? what had you to bate in\r\nyour Pursuit of Maria to pervert Lady Teazle by the way.--had you not a\r\nsufficient field for your Roguery in blinding Sir Peter and supplanting\r\nyour Brother--I hate such an avarice of crimes--'tis an unfair monopoly\r\nand never prospers.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Well I admit I have been to blame--I confess I deviated from\r\nthe direct Road of wrong but I don't think we're so totally defeated\r\nneither.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. No!\r\n\r\nSURFACE. You tell me you have made a trial of Snake since we met--and\r\nthat you still believe him faithful to us--\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. I do believe so.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. And that he has undertaken should it be necessary--to swear and\r\nprove that Charles is at this Time contracted by vows and Honour to\r\nyour Ladyship--which some of his former letters to you will serve to\r\nsupport--\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. This, indeed, might have assisted--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Come--come it is not too late yet--but hark! this is probably\r\nmy Unkle Sir Oliver--retire to that Room--we'll consult further when\r\nHe's gone.--\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Well but if HE should find you out to--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. O I have no fear of that--Sir Peter will hold his tongue for\r\nhis own credit sake--and you may depend on't I shall soon Discover Sir\r\nOliver's weak side!--\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. I have no diffidence of your abilities--only be constant\r\nto one roguery at a time--\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\nSURFACE. I will--I will--So 'tis confounded hard after such bad Fortune,\r\nto be baited by one's confederate in evil--well at all events\r\nmy character is so much better than Charles's, that I\r\ncertainly--hey--what!--this is not Sir Oliver--but old Stanley\r\nagain!--Plague on't that He should return to teaze me just now--I shall\r\nhave Sir Oliver come and find him here--and----\r\n\r\n     Enter SIR OLIVER\r\n\r\nGad's life, Mr. Stanley--why have you come back to plague me at this\r\ntime? you must not stay now upon my word!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Sir--I hear your Unkle Oliver is expected here--and tho' He\r\nhas been so penurious to you, I'll try what He'll do for me--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Sir! 'tis impossible for you to stay now--so I must beg----come\r\nany other time and I promise you you shall be assisted.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. No--Sir Oliver and I must be acquainted--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Zounds Sir then [I] insist on your quitting the--Room\r\ndirectly--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Nay Sir----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Sir--I insist on't--here William show this Gentleman out. Since\r\nyou compel me Sir--not one moment--this is such insolence.\r\n\r\n     [Going to push him out.]\r\n\r\n     Enter CHARLES\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Heyday! what's the matter now?--what the Devil have you got\r\nhold of my little Broker here! Zounds--Brother, don't hurt little\r\nPremium. What's the matter--my little Fellow?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. So! He has been with you, too, has He--\r\n\r\nCHARLES. To be sure He has! Why, 'tis as honest a little----But sure\r\nJoseph you have not been borrowing money too have you?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Borrowing--no!--But, Brother--you know sure we expect Sir\r\nOliver every----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. O Gad, that's true--Noll mustn't find the little Broker here to\r\nbe sure--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Yet Mr. Stanley insists----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Stanley--why his name's Premium--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. No no Stanley.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. No, no--Premium.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Well no matter which--but----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Aye aye Stanley or Premium, 'tis the same thing as you say--for\r\nI suppose He goes by half a hundred Names, besides A. B's at the\r\nCoffee-House. [Knock.]\r\n\r\nSURFACE. 'Sdeath--here's Sir Oliver at the Door----Now I beg--Mr.\r\nStanley----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Aye aye and I beg Mr. Premium----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Gentlemen----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Sir, by Heaven you shall go--\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Aye out with him certainly----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. This violence----\r\n\r\nSURFACE. 'Tis your own Fault.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Out with him to be sure.     [Both forcing SIR OLIVER out.]\r\n\r\n     Enter SIR PETER TEAZLE, LADY TEAZLE, MARIA, and ROWLEY\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. My old Friend, Sir Oliver!--hey! what in the name of\r\nwonder!--Here are dutiful Nephews!--assault their Unkle at his first\r\nVisit!\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Indeed Sir Oliver 'twas well we came in to rescue you.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Truly it was--for I perceive Sir Oliver the character of old\r\nStanley was no Protection to you.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Nor of Premium either--the necessities of the former could\r\nnot extort a shilling from that benevolent Gentleman; and with the other\r\nI stood a chance of faring worse than my Ancestors, and being knocked\r\ndown without being bid for.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Charles!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Joseph!\r\n\r\nSURFACE. 'Tis compleat!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Very!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Sir Peter--my Friend and Rowley too--look on that elder\r\nNephew of mine--You know what He has already received from my Bounty and\r\nyou know also how gladly I would have look'd on half my Fortune as held\r\nin trust for him--judge then my Disappointment in discovering him to be\r\ndestitute of Truth--Charity--and Gratitude--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Sir Oliver--I should be more surprized at this Declaration,\r\nif I had not myself found him to be selfish--treacherous and\r\nHypocritical.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. And if the Gentleman pleads not guilty to these pray let\r\nhim call ME to his Character.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Then I believe we need add no more--if He knows himself He\r\nwill consider it as the most perfect Punishment that He is known to the\r\nworld--\r\n\r\nCHARLES. If they talk this way to Honesty--what will they say to ME by\r\nand bye!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. As for that Prodigal--his Brother there----\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Aye now comes my Turn--the damn'd Family Pictures will ruin\r\nme--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Sir Oliver--Unkle--will you honour me with a hearing--\r\n\r\nCHARLES. I wish Joseph now would make one of his long speeches and I\r\nmight recollect myself a little--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. And I suppose you would undertake to vindicate yourself\r\nentirely--\r\n\r\nSURFACE. I trust I could--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Nay--if you desert your Roguery in its Distress and try to\r\nbe justified--you have even less principle than I thought you had.--[To\r\nCHARLES SURFACE] Well, Sir--and YOU could JUSTIFY yourself too I\r\nsuppose--\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Not that I know of, Sir Oliver.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. What[!] little Premium has been let too much into the secret\r\nI presume.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. True--Sir--but they were Family Secrets, and should not be\r\nmentioned again you know.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Come Sir Oliver I know you cannot speak of Charles's Follies\r\nwith anger.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Odd's heart no more I can--nor with gravity either--Sir\r\nPeter do you know the Rogue bargain'd with me for all his\r\nAncestors--sold me judges and Generals by the Foot, and Maiden Aunts as\r\ncheap as broken China!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. To be sure, Sir Oliver, I did make a little free with the\r\nFamily Canvas that's the truth on't:--my Ancestors may certainly rise in\r\njudgment against me there's no denying it--but believe me sincere when I\r\ntell you, and upon my soul I would not say so if I was not--that if I do\r\nnot appear mortified at the exposure of my Follies, it is because I\r\nfeel at this moment the warmest satisfaction in seeing you, my liberal\r\nbenefactor.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Charles--I believe you--give me your hand again: the\r\nill-looking little fellow over the Couch has made your Peace.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Then Sir--my Gratitude to the original is still encreased.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. [Advancing.] Yet I believe, Sir Oliver, here is one whom\r\nCharles is still more anxious to be reconciled to.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. O I have heard of his Attachment there--and, with the young\r\nLady's Pardon if I construe right that Blush----\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Well--Child--speak your sentiments--you know--we are going to\r\nbe reconciled to Charles--\r\n\r\nMARIA. Sir--I have little to say--but that I shall rejoice to hear that\r\nHe is happy--For me--whatever claim I had to his Affection--I willing\r\nresign to one who has a better title.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. How Maria!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Heyday--what's the mystery now? while he appeared an\r\nincorrigible Rake, you would give your hand to no one else and now that\r\nHe's likely to reform I'll warrant You won't have him!\r\n\r\nMARIA. His own Heart--and Lady Sneerwell know the cause.\r\n\r\n[CHARLES.] Lady Sneerwell!\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Brother it is with great concern--I am obliged to speak on\r\nthis Point, but my Regard to justice obliges me--and Lady Sneerwell's\r\ninjuries can no longer--be concealed--[Goes to the Door.]\r\n\r\n     Enter LADY SNEERWELL\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Soh! another French milliner egad! He has one in every Room\r\nin the House I suppose--\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Ungrateful Charles! Well may you be surprised and feel\r\nfor the indelicate situation which your Perfidy has forced me into.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Pray Unkle, is this another Plot of yours? for as I have Life I\r\ndon't understand it.\r\n\r\nSURFACE. I believe Sir there is but the evidence of one Person more\r\nnecessary to make it extremely clear.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. And that Person--I imagine, is Mr. Snake--Rowley--you were\r\nperfectly right to bring him with us--and pray let him appear.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. Walk in, Mr. Snake--\r\n\r\n     Enter SNAKE\r\n\r\nI thought his Testimony might be wanted--however it happens unluckily\r\nthat He comes to confront Lady Sneerwell and not to support her--\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. A Villain!--Treacherous to me at last! Speak, Fellow,\r\nhave you too conspired against me?\r\n\r\nSNAKE. I beg your Ladyship--ten thousand Pardons--you paid me extremely\r\nLiberally for the Lie in question--but I unfortunately have been offer'd\r\ndouble to speak the Truth.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. The Torments of Shame and Disappointment on you all!\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. Hold--Lady Sneerwell--before you go let me thank you for\r\nthe trouble you and that Gentleman have taken in writing Letters from me\r\nto Charles and answering them yourself--and let me also request you\r\nto make my Respects to the Scandalous College--of which you are\r\nPresident--and inform them that Lady Teazle, Licentiate, begs leave to\r\nreturn the diploma they granted her--as she leaves of[f] Practice and\r\nkills Characters no longer.\r\n\r\nLADY SNEERWELL. Provoking--insolent!--may your Husband live these fifty\r\nyears!\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Oons what a Fury----\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. A malicious Creature indeed!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Hey--not for her last wish?--\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. O No--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Well Sir, and what have you to say now?\r\n\r\nSURFACE. Sir, I am so confounded, to find that Lady Sneerwell could be\r\nguilty of suborning Mr. Snake in this manner to impose on us all that\r\nI know not what to say----however, lest her Revengeful Spirit should\r\nprompt her to injure my Brother I had certainly better follow her\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n     [Exit.]\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Moral to the last drop!\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Aye and marry her Joseph if you can.--Oil and Vinegar\r\negad:--you'll do very well together.\r\n\r\nROWLEY. I believe we have no more occasion for Mr. Snake at Present--\r\n\r\nSNAKE. Before I go--I beg Pardon once for all for whatever uneasiness I\r\nhave been the humble instrument of causing to the Parties present.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Well--well you have made atonement by a good Deed at last--\r\n\r\nSNAKE. But I must Request of the Company that it shall never be known--\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Hey!--what the Plague--are you ashamed of having done a right\r\nthing once in your life?\r\n\r\nSNAKE. Ah: Sir--consider I live by the Badness of my Character!--I have\r\nnothing but my Infamy to depend on!--and, if it were once known that I\r\nhad been betray'd into an honest Action, I should lose every Friend I\r\nhave in the world.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Well--well we'll not traduce you by saying anything to your\r\nPraise never fear.\r\n\r\n     [Exit SNAKE.]\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. There's a precious Rogue--Yet that fellow is a Writer and a\r\nCritic.\r\n\r\nLADY TEAZLE. See[,] Sir Oliver[,] there needs no persuasion now to\r\nreconcile your Nephew and Maria--\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Aye--aye--that's as it should be and egad we'll have the\r\nwedding to-morrow morning--\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Thank you, dear Unkle!\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. What! you rogue don't you ask the Girl's consent first--\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Oh, I have done that a long time--above a minute ago--and She\r\nhas look'd yes--\r\n\r\nMARIA. For Shame--Charles--I protest Sir Peter, there has not been a\r\nword----\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. Well then the fewer the Better--may your love for each other\r\nnever know--abatement.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. And may you live as happily together as Lady Teazle and\r\nI--intend to do--\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Rowley my old Friend--I am sure you congratulate me and I\r\nsuspect too that I owe you much.\r\n\r\nSIR OLIVER. You do, indeed, Charles--\r\n\r\nROWLEY. If my Efforts to serve you had not succeeded you would have been\r\nin my debt for the attempt--but deserve to be happy--and you over-repay\r\nme.\r\n\r\nSIR PETER. Aye honest Rowley always said you would reform.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Why as to reforming Sir Peter I'll make no promises--and that\r\nI take to be a proof that I intend to set about it--But here shall be my\r\nMonitor--my gentle Guide.--ah! can I leave the Virtuous path those Eyes\r\nillumine?\r\n\r\n   Tho' thou, dear Maid, should'st wave [waive] thy Beauty's Sway,\r\n   --Thou still must Rule--because I will obey:\r\n   An humbled fugitive from Folly View,\r\n   No sanctuary near but Love and YOU:\r\n   You can indeed each anxious Fear remove,\r\n   For even Scandal dies if you approve.  [To the audience.]\r\n\r\n     EPILOGUE\r\n\r\n     BY MR. COLMAN\r\n\r\n     SPOKEN BY LADY TEAZLE\r\n\r\n     I, who was late so volatile and gay,\r\n     Like a trade-wind must now blow all one way,\r\n     Bend all my cares, my studies, and my vows,\r\n     To one dull rusty weathercock--my spouse!\r\n     So wills our virtuous bard--the motley Bayes\r\n     Of crying epilogues and laughing plays!\r\n     Old bachelors, who marry smart young wives,\r\n     Learn from our play to regulate your lives:\r\n     Each bring his dear to town, all faults upon her--\r\n     London will prove the very source of honour.\r\n     Plunged fairly in, like a cold bath it serves,\r\n     When principles relax, to brace the nerves:\r\n     Such is my case; and yet I must deplore\r\n     That the gay dream of dissipation's o'er.\r\n     And say, ye fair! was ever lively wife,\r\n     Born with a genius for the highest life,\r\n     Like me untimely blasted in her bloom,\r\n     Like me condemn'd to such a dismal doom?\r\n     Save money--when I just knew how to waste it!\r\n     Leave London--just as I began to taste it!\r\n       Must I then watch the early crowing cock,\r\n     The melancholy ticking of a clock;\r\n     In a lone rustic hall for ever pounded,\r\n     With dogs, cats, rats, and squalling brats surrounded?\r\n     With humble curate can I now retire,\r\n     (While good Sir Peter boozes with the squire,)\r\n     And at backgammon mortify my soul,\r\n     That pants for loo, or flutters at a vole?\r\n     Seven's the main!  Dear sound that must expire,\r\n     Lost at hot cockles round a Christmas fire;\r\n     The transient hour of fashion too soon spent,\r\n     Farewell the tranquil mind, farewell content!\r\n     Farewell the plumed head, the cushion'd tete,\r\n     That takes the cushion from its proper seat!\r\n     That spirit-stirring drum!--card drums I mean,\r\n     Spadille--odd trick--pam--basto--king and queen!\r\n     And you, ye knockers, that, with brazen throat,\r\n     The welcome visitors' approach denote;\r\n     Farewell all quality of high renown,\r\n     Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious town!\r\n     Farewell! your revels I partake no more,\r\n     And Lady Teazle's occupation's o'er!\r\n     All this I told our bard; he smiled, and said 'twas clear,\r\n     I ought to play deep tragedy next year.\r\n     Meanwhile he drew wise morals from his play,\r\n     And in these solemn periods stalk'd away:--\r\n     \"Bless'd were the fair like you; her faults who stopp'd,\r\n     And closed her follies when the curtain dropp'd!\r\n     No more in vice or error to engage,\r\n     Or play the fool at large on life's great stage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PLAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<1> This PORTRAIT and Garrick's PROLOGUE are not included in Fraser\r\nRae's text.\r\n\r\n<2> From Sheridan's manuscript.\r\n\r\n<3> The story in Act I.
