Though bearing the name of the former burgh, it was in\r\nArona[1], where his family also possessed a property, that Pietro\r\nMartire d'Anghera first saw the light, in the year 1457[2]. He was not\r\naverse to reminding his friends of the nobility of his family, whose\r\norigin he confidently traced to the Counts of Anghera, a somewhat\r\nfabulous dynasty, the glories of whose mythical domination in Northern\r\nItaly are preserved in local legends and have not remained entirely\r\nunnoticed by sober history. What name his family bore is unknown; the\r\nstatement that it was a branch of the Sereni, originally made by Celso\r\nRosini and repeated by later writers, being devoid of foundation. Ties\r\nof relationship, which seem to have united his immediate forebears\r\nwith the illustrious family of Trivulzio and possibly also with that\r\nof Borromeo, furnished him with sounder justification for some pride\r\nof ancestry than did the remoter gestes of the apocryphal Counts of\r\nAnghera.[3]\r\n\r\n[Note 1: Ranke, in his _Zur Kritik neuerer Geschichtsschreiber_,\r\nand Rawdon Brown, in his _Calendar of State Papers relating to\r\nEngland, preserved in the Archives of Venice_, mention Anghera, or\r\nAnghiera, as the name is also written, as his birthplace. Earlier\r\nItalian writers such as Piccinelli (_Ateneo de' Letterati Milanesi_)\r\nand Giammatteo Toscano (_Peplus Ital_) are perhaps responsible\r\nfor this error, which passages in the _Opus Epistolarum_, that\r\ninexplicably escaped their notice, expose. In a letter addressed to\r\nFajardo occurs the following explicit statement: \"..._cum me utero\r\nmater gestaret sic volente patre, Aronam, ubi plæraque illis erant\r\nprædia domusque ... ibi me mater dederat orbi_.\" Letters 388, 630, and\r\n794 contain equally positive assertions.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Mazzuchelli (_Gli Scrittori d'Italia_, p. 773) states\r\nthat Peter Martyr was born in 1455, and he has been followed by the\r\nFlorentine Tiraboschi (_Storia della Letteratura Italiana_, vol. vii.)\r\nand later historians, including even Hermann Schumacher in his\r\nmasterly work, _Petrus Martyr der Geschichtsschreiber des Weltmeeres_.\r\nNicolai Antonio (_Bibliotheca Hispana nova_, app. to vol. ii) is alone\r\nin giving the date as 1559. Ciampi, amongst modern Italian authorities\r\n(_Le Fonti Storiche del Rinascimento_) and Heidenheimer (_Petrus\r\nMartyr Anglerius und sein Opus Epistolarum_) after carefully\r\ninvestigating the conflicting data, show from Peter Martyr's own\r\nwritings that he was born on February 2, 1457. Three different\r\npassages are in agreement on this point. In Ep. 627 written in 1518\r\nand referring to his embassy to the Sultan of Egypt upon which he\r\nset out in the autumn of 1501, occurs the following: ..._quatuor et\r\nquadraginta tunc annos agebam, octo decem superadditi vires illas\r\nhebetarunt_. Again in Ep. 1497: _Ego extra annum ad habitis tuis\r\nlitteris quadragesimum_; and finally in the dedication of the Eighth\r\nDecade to Clement VII.: _Septuagesimus quippe annus ætatis, cui nonæ\r\nquartæ Februarii anni millesimi quingentesimi vigesimi sexti proxime\r\nruentis dabunt initium, sua mihi spongea memoriam ita confrigando\r\ndelevit, ut vix e calamo sit lapsa periodus, quando quid egerimsi quis\r\ninterrogaverit, nescire me profitebor. De Orbe Novo_., p. 567. Ed.\r\nParis, 1587. Despite the elucidation of this point, it is noteworthy\r\nthat Prof. Paul Gaffarel both in his admirable French translation of\r\nthe _Opus Epistolarum_ (1897) and in his _Lettres de Pierre Martyr\r\nd'Anghiera_ (1885) should still cite the chronology of Mazzuchelli and\r\nTiraboschi.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3: The Visconti, and after them the Sforza, bore the title\r\nof Conte d'Anghera, or Anghiera, as the name is also spelled.\r\nLodovico il Moro restored to the place the rank of city, which it\r\nhad lost, and of which it was again deprived when Lodovico went into\r\ncaptivity.]\r\n\r\nThe cult of the Dominican of Verona, murdered by the Waldensians in\r\n1252 and later canonised under the title of St. Peter Martyr, was\r\nfervent and widespread in Lombardy in the fifteenth century. Milan\r\npossessed his bones, entombed in a chapel of Sant' Eustorgio decorated\r\nby Michelozzi. Under the patronage and name of Peter Martyr, the child\r\nof the Anghera was baptised and, since his family name fell into\r\noblivion, _Martyr_ has replaced it. Mention of his kinsmen is\r\ninfrequent in his voluminous writings, though there is evidence that\r\nhe furthered the careers of two younger brothers when the opportunity\r\noffered. For Giorgio he solicited and obtained from Lodovico Sforza,\r\nin 1487, the important post of governor of Monza. For Giambattista he\r\nprocured from the Spanish sovereigns a recommendation which enabled\r\nhim to enter the service of the Venetian Republic, under whose\r\nstandard he campaigned with Nicola Orsini, Count of Pitigliano.\r\nGiambattista died in Brescia in 1516, leaving a wife and four\r\ndaughters. A nephew, Gian Antonio, whose name occurs in several of his\r\nuncle's letters is described by the latter as _licet ex transverso\r\nnatus_; he served under Gian Giacomo Trivulzio, and finally, despite\r\nhis bar sinister, married a daughter of Francesco, of the illustrious\r\nMilanese family of Pepoli.[4]\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Peter Martyr's will gave to his only surviving brother,\r\nGiorgio, his share of the family estate, but on condition that he\r\nshould receive Giambattista's daughter, Laura, in his family and\r\nprovide for her: _emponiendola en todas las buenas costumbres y\r\ncrianza que hija de tal padre merece_ (_Coll. de Documentos ineditos\r\npara la Hist, de España_, tom. xxxix., pp. 397). Another of\r\nGiambattista's daughters, Lucrezia, who was a nun, received one\r\nhundred ducats by her uncle's will.]\r\n\r\nConcerning his earlier years and his education Peter Martyr is silent,\r\nnor does he anywhere mention under whose direction he began his\r\nstudies. In the education deemed necessary for young men of his\r\nquality, the exercises of chivalry and the recreations of the\r\ntroubadour found equal place, and such was doubtless the training he\r\nreceived. He spent some years at the ducal court of Milan, but there\r\nis no indication that he frequented the schools of such famous\r\nHellenists as Francesco Filelfo who, in 1471, was there lecturing\r\non the Politics of Aristotle, and of Constantine Lascaris whom the\r\nreigning duke, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, commissioned to compile a Greek\r\ngrammar for the use of his daughter. In later years, when he found\r\nhis chief delight and highest distinction in intercourse with men of\r\nletters, Peter Martyr would hardly have neglected to mention such\r\nprecious early associations had they existed.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of the family of Anghera were the reverse of opulent at\r\nthat period of its history, and the sons obtained careers under the\r\npatronage of Count Giovanni Borromeo. The times were troublous in\r\nLombardy. The assassination, in 1476, of Gian Galeazzo was followed\r\nby commotions and unrest little conducive to the cultivation of the\r\nhumanities, and which provoked an exodus of humanists and their\r\ndisciples. Many sought refuge from the turbulence prevailing in the\r\nnorth, in the more pacific atmosphere of Rome, where a numerous colony\r\nof Lombards was consequently formed. The following year Peter Martyr,\r\nbeing then twenty years of age, joined his compatriots in their\r\ncongenial exile. His rank and personal qualities, as well as the\r\nprotection accorded him by Giovanni Arcimboldo, Archbishop of Milan,\r\nand Ascanio Sforza, brother of the Duke, Lodovico il Moro, assured him\r\na cordial welcome. For a youth devoid of pretensions to humanistic\r\nculture, he penetrated with singular ease and rapidity into the\r\ninnermost academic circle, over which reigned the most amiable of\r\nmodern pagans, Pomponius Lætus.\r\n\r\nIt was the age of the Academies. During the Ecumenical Council of\r\nFlorence, Giovanni de' Medici, fired with enthusiasm for the study\r\nof Platonic philosophy, brilliantly expounded by the learned Greek,\r\nGemisto, conceived the plan of promoting the revival of classical\r\nlearning by the formation of an academy, in imitation of that founded\r\nby the immortal Plato. Under such lofty patronage, this genial\r\nconception, so entirely in consonance with the intellectual tendencies\r\nof the age, attracted to its support every Florentine who aspired to\r\na reputation for culture, at a time when culture was fashionable. The\r\nGreek Cardinal, Bessarion, whom Eugene IV. had raised to the purple at\r\nthe close of the Council, carried the Medicean novelty to Rome, where\r\nhe formed a notable circle, in which the flower of Hellenic and Latin\r\nculture was represented. Besides this group, characterised by a\r\ntheological tincture alien to the neo-pagan spirit in flimsily\r\ndisguised revolt against Christian dogma and morality, Pomponius Lætus\r\nand Platina founded the Roman Academy--an institution destined to\r\nworld-wide celebrity. Pomponius Lætus, an unrecognised bastard of the\r\nnoble house of Sanseverini, was professor of eloquence in Rome. Great\r\namongst the humanists, in him the very spirit of ancient Hellas seemed\r\nrevived. What to many was but the fad or fashionable craze of the\r\nhour, was to him the all-important and absorbing purpose of living. He\r\ndwelt aloof in poverty; shunning the ante-chambers and tables of the\r\ngreat, he and kindred souls communed with their disciples in the\r\nshades of his grove of classic laurels. He was indifferent alike to\r\nprincely and to popular favour, passionately consecrating his efforts\r\nto the revival and preservation of such classics as had survived the\r\ndestructive era known as the Dark Ages. Denied a name of his own,\r\nhe adopted a Latin one to his liking, thus from necessity setting a\r\nfashion his imitators followed from affectation. When approached in\r\nthe days of his fame by the Sanseverini with proposals to recognise\r\nhim as a kinsman, he answered with a proud and laconic refusal.[5] The\r\nAcademy, formed of super-men infected with pagan ideals, contemptuous\r\nof scholastic learning and impatient of the restraints of Christian\r\nmorality, did not long escape the suspicions of the orthodox;\r\nsuspicions only too well warranted and inevitably productive of\r\nantagonism ending in condemnation.[6]\r\n\r\n[Note 5: His refusal was in the following curt form: _Pomponius\r\nLætus cognatis et propinquis suis, salutem. Quod petitis fieri non\r\npotest.--Valete_. Consult Tiraboschi, _Storia della Letteratura\r\nItaliana_, vol. vii., cap. v.; Gregorovius, _Geschichte der Stadt Rom\r\nin Mittelalter_; Burkhardt, _Die Kultur der Renaissance in Italien_,\r\nand Voigt in his _Wiederlebung des Klassischen Alterthums_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6: Sabellicus, in a letter to Antonio Morosini (_Liber\r\nEpistolarum_, xi., p. 459) wrote thus of Pomponius Lætus: ..._fuit\r\nab initio contemptor religionis, sed ingravesciente ætate coepit res\r\nipsa, ut mibi dicitur curæ esse. In Crispo et Livio reposint quædam;\r\net si nemo religiosius timidiusques tractavit veterum scripta ...\r\nGræca ... vix attingit_. While to a restricted number, humanism stood\r\nfor intellectual emancipation, to the many it meant the rejection of\r\nthe moral restraints on conduct imposed by the law of the Church,\r\nand a revival of the vices that flourished in the decadent epochs of\r\nGreece and Rome.]\r\n\r\nFrom trifles, as they may seem to us at this distance of time, hostile\r\ningenuity wove the web destined to enmesh the incautious Academicians.\r\nThe adoption of fanciful Latin appellations--in itself a sufficiently\r\ninnocent conceit--was construed into a demonstration of revolt against\r\nestablished Christian usage, almost savouring of contempt for the\r\ncanonised saints of the Church.\r\n\r\nPomponius Lætus was nameless, and hence free to adopt whatever name he\r\nchose; his associates and admiring disciples paid him the homage of\r\nimitation, proud to associate themselves, by means of this pedantic\r\nfancy, with him they called master. The Florentine, Buonacorsi, took\r\nthe name of Callimachus Experiens; the Roman, Marco, masqueraded as\r\nAsclepiades; two Venetian brothers gladly exchanged honest, vulgar\r\nPiscina for the signature of Marsus, while another, Marino, adopted\r\nthat of Glaucus.\r\n\r\nIf the neo-pagans were harmless and playful merely, their opponents\r\nwere dangerously in earnest. In 1468 a grave charge of conspiracy\r\nagainst the Pope's life and of organising a schism led to the arrest\r\nof Pomponius and Platina, some of the more wary members of the\r\ncompromised fraternity saving themselves by timely flight.\r\n\r\nImprisonment in Castel Sant' Angelo and even the use of torture--mild,\r\ndoubtless--failing to extract incriminating admissions from the\r\naccused, both prisoners were unconditionally released. If the Pope\r\nfelt serious alarm, his fears seem to have been easily allayed, for\r\nPomponius was permitted to resume his public lectures undisturbed, but\r\nthe Roman Academy had received a check, from which it did not recover\r\nduring the remainder of the pontificate of Paul II. With the accession\r\nof Sixtus IV., the cloud of disfavour that still hung obscuringly\r\nover its glories was lifted. Encouraged by the Pope and frequented by\r\ndistinguished members of the Curia, its era of greatness dawned in\r\nsplendour.\r\n\r\nThe assault upon the Church by the humanists, which resulted in the\r\npartial capture of Latin Christianity, was ably directed. Although\r\nthe renascence of learning did not take its rise in Rome, where the\r\nintellectual movement and enthusiasm imported from Florence flourished\r\nbut fitfully, according to the various humours of the successive\r\npontiffs, the papal capital drew within its walls eminent scholars\r\nfrom all the states of the Italian peninsula. Rome was the world-city,\r\na centre from which radiated honours, distinctions, and fortune. Gifts\r\nof oratory, facility in debate, ability in the conduct of diplomatic\r\nnegotiations, a masterly style in Latin composition, and even\r\nperfection in penmanship, were all marketable accomplishments, for\r\nwhich Rome was the highest bidder. If classical learning and the\r\ngraces of literature received but intermittent encouragement from the\r\nsovereign pontiffs, both the secular interests of their government and\r\nthe vindication of the Church's dogmatic teaching afforded the most\r\nprofitable exercise for talents which sceptical humanists sold, as\r\nreadily as did the condottieri their swords--to the best paymaster,\r\nregardless of their personal convictions. There consequently came into\r\nexistence in Rome a new _ceto_ or class, equally removed from the\r\nnobles of feudal traditions and the ecclesiastics of the Curia, yet\r\nmingling with both. Literary style and the art of Latin composition,\r\nsedulously cultivated by these brilliant intellectual nomads, shed an\r\nundoubted lustre on the Roman chancery, giving it a stamp it has\r\nnever entirely lost. They fought battles and scored victories for an\r\northodoxy they derided. They defended the Church's temporalities from\r\nthe encroachments of covetous princes. Their influence on morals was\r\nfrankly pagan. Expatriated and emancipated from all laws save those\r\ndictated by their own tastes and inclinations, these men were genially\r\nrebellious against the restraints and discipline imposed by the\r\nevangelical law. From the Franciscan virtues of chastity, poverty, and\r\nobedience, preached by the _Poverello_ of Assisi, they turned with\r\naversion to laud the antipodal trinity of lust, license, and luxury.\r\nThe mysticism of medieval Christianity was repugnant to their\r\nmaterialism, and the symbolism of its art, expressed under rigid,\r\ngraceless forms, offended eyes that craved beauty of line and beauty\r\nof colour. They ignored or condemned any ulterior purpose of art as a\r\nteaching medium for spiritual truths. To such men, a satire of Juvenal\r\nwas more precious than an epistle of St. Paul; dogma, they demolished\r\nwith epigrams, the philosophy of the schoolmen was a standing joke,\r\nand a passage from Plato or Horace outweighed the definitions of an\r\nEcumenical Council.\r\n\r\nThe toleration extended to these heterodox scholars seems to have\r\nbeen unlimited,--perhaps it was not in some instances unmixed with\r\ncontempt, for, though they lampooned the clergy of all grades, not\r\nsparing even the Pope himself, their writings, even when not free from\r\npositive scurrility, were allowed the freest circulation. In all\r\nthat pertained to personal conduct and morality, they directed their\r\nexclusive efforts to assimilating classical standards of the\r\ndecadent periods, ignoring the austere virtues of civic probity,\r\nself-restraint, and frugality, that characterised the best society of\r\nGreek and Rome in their florescence. These same men lived on terms\r\nof close intimacy with princes of the Church, on whose bounty they\r\nthrove, and by degrees numbers of them even entered the ranks of the\r\nclergy, some with minor and others with holy orders. To their labours,\r\nthe world owes the recovery of the classic literature of Greece and\r\nRome from oblivion, while the invention and rapid adoption of the\r\nprinting-press rendered these precious texts forever indestructible\r\nand accessible.\r\n\r\nInto this brilliant, dissolute world of intellectual activity, Peter\r\nMartyr entered, and through it he passed unscathed, emerging with his\r\nChristian faith intact and his orthodoxy untainted. He gathered the\r\ngold of classical learning, rejecting its dross; his morals were\r\nabove reproach and calumny never touched his reputation. Respected,\r\nappreciated, and, most of all, beloved by his contemporaries, his\r\nwritings enriched the intellectual heritage of posterity with\r\ninexhaustible treasures of original information concerning the great\r\nevents of the memorable epoch it was his privilege to illustrate.\r\n\r\nGeneral culture being widely diffused, the pedantic imitations of\r\nantiquity applauded by the preceding generation ceased to confer\r\ndistinction. Latin still held its supremacy but the Italian language,\r\nno longer reputed vulgar, was coming more and more into favour as a\r\nvehicle for the expression of original thought. Had he remained in\r\nItaly Martyr might well have used it, but his removal to Spain imposed\r\nLatin as the language of his voluminous compositions.\r\n\r\nFour years after his arrival in Rome, a Milanese noble, Bartolomeo\r\nScandiano, who later went as nuncio to Spain, invited Peter Martyr\r\nto pass the summer months in his villa at Rieti, in company with the\r\nBishop of Viterbo. In the fifteenth letter of the _Opus Epistolarum_\r\nhe recalls the impressions and recollections of that memorable visit,\r\nin the following terms: \"Do you remember, Scandiano, with what\r\nenthusiasm we dedicated our days to poetical composition? Then did I\r\nfirst appreciate the importance of association with the learned and to\r\nwhat degree the mind of youth is elevated in the amiable society of\r\nserious men: then, for the first time, I ventured to think myself a\r\nman and to hope that I might become somebody.\" The summer of 1481 may,\r\ntherefore, be held to mark his intellectual awakening and the birth of\r\nhis definite ambitions. Endowed by nature with the qualities necessary\r\nto success, intimate association with men of eminent culture inspired\r\nhim with the determination to emulate them, and from this ideal he\r\nnever deflected. The remaining six years of his life in Rome were\r\ndevoted to the pursuit of knowledge, and in the art of deciphering\r\ninscriptions and the geography of the ancients he acquired singular\r\nproficiency.\r\n\r\nDuring the pontificate of Innocent VIII., Francesco Negro, a Milanese\r\nby birth, was governor of Rome and him Peter Martyr served as\r\nsecretary; a service which, for some reason, necessitated several\r\nmonths' residence in Perugia. His relations with Ascanio Sforza,\r\ncreated cardinal in 1484, continued to be close, and at one period he\r\nmay have held some position in the cardinal's household or in that\r\nof Cardinal Giovanni Arcimboldo, Archbishop of Milan, though it is\r\nnowhere made clear precisely what, while some authorities incline to\r\nnumber him merely among the assiduous courtiers of these dignitaries\r\nfrom his native Lombardy.\r\n\r\nThe fame of his scholarship had meanwhile raised him from the position\r\nof disciple to a place amongst the masters of learning, and in his\r\nturn he saw gathering about him a group of admirers and adulators.\r\nBesides Pomponius Lætus, his intimates of this period were Theodore of\r\nPavia and Peter Marsus, the less celebrated of the Venetian brothers.\r\nHe stood in the relation of preceptor or mentor to Alonso Carillo,\r\nBishop of Pamplona, and to Jorge da Costa, Archbishop of Braga, two\r\npersonages of rank, who did but follow the prevailing fashion that\r\ndecreed the presence of a humanist scholar to be an indispensable\r\nappendage in the households of the great. He read and commented the\r\nclassics to his exalted patrons, was the arbiter of taste, their\r\nfriend, the companion of their cultured leisure, and their confidant.\r\nReplying to the praises of his disciples, couched in extravagant\r\nlanguage, he administered a mild rebuke, recalling them to moderation\r\nin the expression of their sentiments: \"These are not the lessons you\r\nreceived from me when I explained to you the satire of the divine\r\nJuvenal; on the contrary, you have learned that nothing more shames a\r\nfree man than adulation.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[Note 7: Epist. x. _Non hæc a me profecto, quam ambobus Juvenalis\r\naliguando divinam illam, quæ proxima est a secunda, satiram aperirem,\r\nsed adulatione nihil esse ingenuo foedius dedicistis_.]\r\n\r\nThe year 1486 was signalised in Rome by the arrival of an embassy from\r\nFerdinand and Isabella to make the usual oath of obedience on behalf\r\nof the Catholic sovereigns of Castille and Leon to their spiritual\r\nover-lord, the Pope. Iñigo Lopez de Mendoza, Count of Tendilla, a son\r\nof the noble house of Mendoza, whose cardinal was termed throughout\r\nEurope _tertius rex_, was the ambassador charged with this mission.[8]\r\nTendilla shone in a family in which intellectual brilliancy was a\r\nheritage, the accomplishments of its members adding distinction to a\r\nhouse of origin and descent exceptionally illustrious. Whether in the\r\nhouse of his compatriot, the Bishop of Pamplona, or elsewhere, the\r\nambassador made the acquaintance of Peter Martyr and evidently fell\r\nunder the charm of his noble character and uncommon talents. The\r\nduties of his embassy, and possibly his own good pleasure, detained\r\nTendilla in Rome from September 13, 1486, until August 29th of the\r\nfollowing year, and, as his stay drew to its close, he pressingly\r\ninvited the Italian scholar to return with him to Spain, an invitation\r\nwhich neither the remonstrances nor supplications of his friends\r\nin Rome availed to persuade him to refuse. No one could more\r\nadvantageously introduce a foreigner at the Court of Spain than\r\nTendilla. What prospects he held out or what arguments he used to\r\ninduce Martyr to quit Rome and Italy, we do not know; apparently\r\nlittle persuasion was required. A true child of his times, Peter\r\nMartyr was prepared to accept his intellectual heritage wherever he\r\nfound it. From the obscure parental village of Arona, his steps first\r\nled him to the ducal court of Milan, which served as a stepping-stone\r\nfrom which he advanced into the wider world of Rome. The papal capital\r\nknew him first as a disciple, then as a master, but the doubt whether\r\nhe was satisfied to wait upon laggard pontifical favours is certainly\r\npermissible. He had made warm friendships, had enjoyed the intimacy of\r\nthe great, and the congenial companionship of kindred spirits, but his\r\ntalents had secured no permanent or lucrative recognition from the\r\nSovereign Pontiff. The announcement of his resolution to accompany\r\nthe ambassador to Spain caused consternation amongst his friends\r\nwho opposed, by every argument they could muster, a decision they\r\nconsidered displayed both ingratitude and indifferent judgment.\r\nNothing availed to change the decision he had taken and, since to each\r\none he answered as he deemed expedient, and as each answer differed\r\nfrom the other, it is not easy to fix upon the particular reason which\r\nprompted him to seek his fortune in Spain.\r\n\r\n[Note 8: From Burchard's _Diarium_, 1483-1506, and from the\r\n_Chronicle_ of Pulgar we learn that Antonio Geraldini and Juan de\r\nMedina, the latter afterwards Bishop of Astorga, accompanied the\r\nembassy.]\r\n\r\nTo Ascanio Sforza, who spared neither entreaties nor reproaches to\r\ndetain him, assuring him that during his lifetime his merits should\r\nnot lack recognition, Martyr replied that the disturbed state of\r\nItaly, which he apprehended would grow worse, discouraged him; adding\r\nthat he was urged on by an ardent desire to see the world and to make\r\nacquaintance with other lands. To Peter Marsus, he declared he felt\r\nimpelled to join in the crusade against the Moors. Spain was the seat\r\nof this holy war, and the Catholic sovereigns, who had accomplished\r\nthe unity of the Christian states of the Iberian peninsula, were\r\nliberal in their offers of honours and recompense to foreigners of\r\ndistinction whom they sought to draw to their court and camp. Spain\r\nmay well have seemed a virgin and promising field, in which his\r\ntalents might find a more generous recognition than Rome had awarded\r\nthem. Upon his arrival there, he showed himself no mean courtier when\r\nhe declared to the Queen that his sole reason for coming was to behold\r\nthe most celebrated woman in the world--herself. Perhaps the sincerest\r\nexpression of his feelings is that contained in a letter to Carillo.\r\n(Ep. 86. 1490): _Formosum est cuique, quod maxime placet: id si cum\r\npatria minime quis se sperat habiturum, tanta est hujusce rei vis, ut\r\nextra patriam quæritet patria ipsius oblitus. Ego quam vos deservistis\r\nadivi quia quod mihi pulchrum suaveque videbatur in ea invenire\r\nsperavi_. The divine restlessness, the _Wanderlust_ had seized him,\r\nand to its fascination he yielded. The opportunity offered by Tendilla\r\nwas too tempting to be resisted. Summing up the remonstrances and\r\nreproaches of his various friends, he declared that he held himself to\r\ndeserve rather their envy than their commiseration, since amidst\r\nthe many learned men in Italy he felt himself obscure and useless,\r\ncounting himself indeed as _passerunculus inter accipitres, pygmeolus\r\ninter gigantes_.\r\n\r\nFailing to turn his friend from his purpose, Cardinal Ascanio\r\nSforza exacted from him a promise to send him regular and frequent\r\ninformation of all that happened at the Spanish Court. It is to this\r\npact between the two friends that posterity is indebted for the\r\nDecades and the _Opus Epistolarum_, in which the events of those\r\nsingularly stirring years are chronicled in a style that portrays\r\nwith absolute fidelity the temper of an age prolific in men of\r\nextraordinary genius and unsurpassed daring, incomparably rich in\r\nachievements that changed the face of the world and gave a new\r\ndirection to the trend of human development.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-ninth of August the Spanish ambassador, after taking\r\nleave of Innocent VIII.,[9] set out from Rome on his return journey to\r\nSpain, and with him went Peter Martyr d'Anghera.\r\n\r\n[Note 9: _Dixi ante sacros pedes prostratus lacrymosum vale quarto\r\ncalendi Septembris 1487_. (Ep. i.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nSpain in the year 1487 presented a striking contrast to Italy where,\r\nfrom the days of Dante to those of Machiavelli, the land had echoed to\r\nthe vain cry: _Pax, pax et non erat pax_. Peter Martyr was impressed\r\nby the unaccustomed spectacle of a united country within whose\r\nboundaries peace reigned. This happy condition had followed upon the\r\nrelentless suppression of feudal chiefs whose acts of brigandage,\r\npillage, and general lawlessness had terrorised the people and\r\nenfeebled the State during the preceding reign.\r\n\r\nThe same nobles who had fought under Isabella's standard against Henry\r\nIV. did not scruple to turn their arms upon their young sovereign,\r\nonce she was seated upon the throne. Lucio Marineo Siculo has drawn a\r\nsombre picture of life in Spain prior to the establishment of order\r\nunder Ferdinand and Isabella. To accomplish the needed reform, it was\r\nnecessary to break the power and humble the pretensions of the feudal\r\nnobles. The Duke of Villahermosa, in command of an army maintained\r\nby contributions from the towns, waged a merciless campaign, burning\r\ncastles and administering red-handed but salutary justice to rebels\r\nagainst the royal authority, and to all disturbers of public order\r\nthroughout the realm.\r\n\r\nThis drastic work of internal pacification was completed before the\r\narrival of our Lombard scholar at the Spanish Court. Castile and\r\nAragon united, internal strife overcome, the remaining undertaking\r\nworthiest to engage the attention of the monarchs was the conquest of\r\nthe unredeemed southern provinces. Ten years of intermittent warfare\r\nhad brought the Christian troops to the very walls of Granada, but\r\nGranada still held out. Almeria and Guadiz were in possession of the\r\nenemy and over the towers of Baza the infidel flag proudly floated.\r\n\r\nThe reception accorded Tendilla's protégé by the King and Queen in\r\nSaragossa was benign and encouraging. Isabella already caressed the\r\nidea of encouraging the cultivation of the arts and literature amongst\r\nthe Spaniards, and her first thought was to confide to the newcomer\r\nthe education of the young nobles and pages about the Court--youths\r\ndestined to places of influence in Church and State. She was not a\r\nlittle surprised when the reputed savant modestly deprecated his\r\nqualifications for such a responsible undertaking, and declared his\r\nwish was to join in the crusade against the infidels in Andalusia.\r\nSome mirth was even provoked by the idea of the foreign scholar\r\nmasquerading as a soldier.\r\n\r\nIn 1489, King Ferdinand, who had assembled a powerful force at Jaen,\r\nmarched to the assault of Baza, a strong place, ably defended at\r\nthat time by Abdullah, known under the proud title of El Zagal--the\r\nVictorious--because of his many victories over the Christian armies he\r\nhad encountered. During the memorable siege that ended in the fall of\r\nBaza, Peter Martyr played his dual rôle of soldier and historian. The\r\nMoors defended the city with characteristic bravery, for they were\r\nfighting for their property, their liberty, and their lives. From\r\nJaen, where Isabella had established herself to be near the seat\r\nof war, messages of encouragement daily reached the King and his\r\ncommanders, inciting them to victory, for which the Queen and her\r\nladies daily offered prayers. Impregnable Baza fell on the fourth of\r\nDecember, and, with its fall, the Moorish power in Spain was forever\r\nbroken. Smaller cities and numerous strongholds in the surrounding\r\ncountry hastened to offer their submission and, after the humiliating\r\nsurrender of El Zagal in the Spanish camp at Tabernas, Almeria opened\r\nits gates to the triumphant Christians who sang _Te Deum_ within its\r\nwalls on Christmas day. Peter Martyr's description of this victorious\r\ncampaign has proved a rich source from which later writers have\r\ngenerously drawn, not always with adequate acknowledgment. From Jaen\r\nthe Court withdrew to Seville, where the marriage of the princess\r\nroyal to the crown prince of Portugal was celebrated.\r\n\r\nBoabdilla still held Granada, oblivious of his engagement to surrender\r\nthat city when his rival, El Zagal, should be conquered.[1] We need\r\nnot here digress to rehearse the oft-told story of the siege of\r\nGranada, during which Moslem rivalled Christian in deeds of chivalry.\r\nPeter Martyr's letters in the _Opus Epistolarum_ recount these events.\r\nHe shared to the full the exultation of the victors, but was not\r\noblivious of the grief and humiliation of the vanquished whom\r\nhe describes as weeping and lamenting upon the graves of their\r\nforefathers, with a choice between captivity and exile before their\r\ndespairing eyes. He portrays his impressions upon entering with the\r\nvictorious Christian host into the stately city. _Alhambrum, proh dii\r\nimmortales! Qualem regiam, romane purpurate, unicam in orbe terrarum,\r\ncrede_, he exclaims in his letter to Cardinal Arcimboldo of Milan.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: The Moorish power was at this time weakened by an\r\ninternal dissension. El Zagal had succeeded his brother, Muley Abdul\r\nHassan, who, at the time of his death ruled over Baza, Guadiz,\r\nAlmeria, and other strongholds in the south-east, while his son\r\nBoabdil was proclaimed in Granada, thus dividing the kingdom against\r\nitself, at a moment when union was most essential to its preservation.\r\nBoabdil had accepted the protection of King Ferdinand and had even\r\nstipulated the surrender of Granada as the reward for his uncle's\r\ndefeat. Consult Prescott's _Ferdinand and Isabella_.]\r\n\r\nDivers are the appreciations of the precise part played by Peter\r\nMartyr in the course of this war. He spent quite as much time with\r\nthe Queen's court as he did at the front, and he himself advances but\r\nmodest claims to war's laurels, writing rather as one who had missed\r\nhis vocation amongst men whose profession was fighting. The career he\r\nsought did not lie in that direction. In later years writing to his\r\nfriend Marliano, he observed: _De bello autem si consilium amici\r\nvis, bella gerant bellatores. Philosophis inhæreat lectionis et\r\ncontemplationis studium_.\r\n\r\nGlorious as the date of Granada's capture might have been in Spanish\r\nhistory, it acquired world-wide significance from the decision given\r\nin favour of the project of Christopher Columbus which followed as a\r\nconsequence of the Christian victory. Though he nowhere states the\r\nfact, Martyr must at this time[2] have known the Genoese suppliant for\r\nroyal patronage. Talavera, confessor to the Queen, was the friend and\r\nprotector of both Italians.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Navarrete states that the two Italians had known one\r\nanother intimately prior to the siege of Granada. _Coleccion de\r\ndocumentos ineditos_, tom. i., p. 68.]\r\n\r\nFascinated by the novelties and charms of Granada, Martyr remained in\r\nthe conquered city when the Court withdrew. His friend Tendilla was\r\nappointed first governor of the province and Talavera became its first\r\narchbishop. Comparing the city with others, famous and beautiful in\r\nItaly, he declared Granada to be the loveliest of them all; for Venice\r\nwas devoid of landscape and surrounded only by sea; Milan lay in a\r\nflat stretch of monotonous plain; Florence might boast her hills,\r\nbut they made her winter climate frigid, while Rome was afflicted by\r\nunwholesome winds from Africa and such poisonous exhalations from the\r\nsurrounding marshes that few of her citizens lived to old age. Such,\r\nto eyes sensitive to Nature's charms and to a mind conscious of\r\nhistorical significance, was the prize that had fallen to the Catholic\r\nsovereigns.[3]\r\n\r\n[Note 3: In the month of June, 1492.]\r\n\r\nWhat influences worked to prepare the change which took place in Peter\r\nMartyr's life within the next few months are not known. After the\r\nbriefest preparation, he took minor orders and occupied a canon's\r\nstall in the cathedral of Granada. Of a religious vocation, understood\r\nin the theological sense, there appears to have been no pretence,\r\nbut ten years later we find him a priest, with the rank of apostolic\r\nprotonotary. Writing on March 28, 1492, to Muro, the dean of\r\nCompostello he observed: _Ad Saturnum, cessante Marte, sub hujus\r\nsancti viri archiepiscopi umbra tento transfugere; a thorace jam ad\r\ntogam me transtuli_. In the coherent organisation of society as it\r\nwas then ordered, men were classified in distinct and recognisable\r\ncategories, each of which opened avenues to the ambitious for\r\nattaining its special prizes. Spain was still scarcely touched by\r\nthe culture of the Renaissance. Outside the Church there was little\r\nlearning or desire for knowledge, nor did any other means for\r\nrecompensing scholars exist than by the bestowal of ecclesiastical\r\nbenefices. A prebend, a canonry, a professorship in the schools or\r\nuniversity were the sole sources of income for a man of letters. Peter\r\nMartyr was such, nor did any other road to the distinction he frankly\r\ndesired, open before him. Perhaps Archbishop Talavera made this point\r\nclear to him. Disillusionised, if indeed he had ever entertained\r\nserious hope of success as a soldier, it cost him no effort to change\r\nfrom the military to the more congenial sacerdotal caste.\r\n\r\nGranada, for all its charms, quickly palled, and his first enthusiasm\r\nsubsiding, gave place to a sense of confinement, isolation, and\r\nunrest. Not the companionship of his two attached friends could make\r\nlife in a provincial town, remote from the Court, tolerable to one who\r\nhad spent ten years of his life in the cultured world of Rome. The\r\nmonotonous routine of a canon's duties meant stagnation to his keen,\r\ncurious temperament, athirst for movement and novelty. His place was\r\namongst men, in the midst of events where he might observe, study,\r\nand philosophically comment. Writing to Cardinal Mendoza, he frankly\r\nconfessed his unrest, declaring that the delights and beauties of\r\nNature, praised by the classical writers, ended by disgusting him and\r\nthat he could never know contentment save in the society of great men.\r\nHis nature craved life on the mountain tops of distinction rather than\r\nexistence in the valley of content. He did not yearn for Tusculum.\r\n\r\nTo manage a graceful re-entry to the Court was not easy. To Archbishop\r\nTalavera, genial and humane, had succeeded the austere Ximenes\r\nas confessor to Isabella. The post was an important one, for the\r\nascendancy of its occupant over the Queen was incontestable, but,\r\nwhile Peter Martyr's perspicacity was quick to grasp the desirability\r\nof conciliating the new confessor, it equally divined the barriers\r\nforbidding access to the remote, detached Franciscan. In one of\r\nhis letters he compared the penetration of Ximenes to that of St.\r\nAugustine, his austerity to that of St. Jerome, and his zeal for\r\nthe faith to that of St. Ambrose. Cardinal Ximenes had admirers and\r\ndetractors, but he had no friends.\r\n\r\nIn this dilemma Martyr felt himself alone, abandoned, and he was not\r\na little troubled as to his future prospects, for he was without an\r\nadvocate near the Queen. He wrote to several personages, even to the\r\nyoung Prince, Don Juan, and evidently without result, for he observed\r\nwith a tinge of bitterness: \"I see that King's favours, the chief\r\nobject of men's efforts, are more shifting and empty than the wind.\"\r\nFortune was kinder to him than she often shows herself to others\r\nwho no less assiduously cultivate her favour, nor was his patience\r\nover-taxed by long waiting. With the return of peace, Queen Isabella's\r\ninterest in her plan for encouraging a revival of learning amongst\r\nher courtiers re-awakened. It was her desire that the Spanish nobles\r\nshould cultivate the arts and literature, after the fashion prevailing\r\nin Italy. Lucio Marineo Siculo, also a disciple of Pomponius Lætus,\r\nhad preceded Martyr in Spain by nearly two years, and was professor of\r\npoetry and grammar at Salamanca. He was the first of the Italians who\r\ncame as torch-bearers of the Renaissance into Spain, to be followed\r\nby Peter Martyr, Columbus, the Cabots, Gattinara, the Geraldini and\r\nMarliano. Cardinal Mendoza availed himself of the propitious moment,\r\nto propose Martyr's name for the office of preceptor to direct the\r\nstudies of the young noblemen. In response to a welcome summons, the\r\nimpatient canon left Granada and repaired to Valladolid where the\r\nCourt then resided.[4] The ungrateful character and dubious results\r\nof the task before him were obvious, the chief difficulties to be\r\napprehended threatening to come from his noble pupils, whose minds\r\nand manners he was expected to form. Restive under any save military\r\ndiscipline, averse by temperament and custom to studies of any sort,\r\nit was hardly to be hoped that they would easily exchange their gay,\r\nidle habits for schoolroom tasks under a foreign pedagogue. Yet this\r\nmiracle did Peter Martyr work. The charm of his personality counted\r\nfor much, the enthusiasm of the Queen and the presence in the school\r\nof the Infante Don Juan, whose example the youthful courtiers dared\r\nnot disdain, for still more, and the house of the Italian preceptor\r\nbecame the fashionable rendezvous of young gallants who, a few months\r\nearlier, would have scoffed at the idea of conning lessons in grammar\r\nand poetry, and listening to lectures on morals and conduct from a\r\nforeigner. Of his quarters in Saragossa in the first year of his\r\nclasses he wrote: _Domum habeo tota die ebullientibus Procerum\r\njuvenibus repletam_.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: In the month of June, 1492.]\r\n\r\nDuring the next nine years of his life, Peter Martyr devoted himself\r\nto his task and with results that gratified the Queen and reflected\r\ncredit upon her choice. In October of 1492 he had been appointed by\r\nthe Queen, _Contino de su casa_,[5] with a revenue of thirty thousand\r\nmaravedis. Shortly after, he was given a chaplaincy in the royal\r\nhousehold, an appointment which increased both his dignity and his\r\nincome. His position was now assured, his popularity and influence\r\ndaily expanded.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: An office in the Queen's household, the duties and\r\nprivileges of which are not quite clear. Mariéjol suggests that the\r\n_contini_ corresponded to the _gentilshommes de la chambre_ at\r\nthe French Court. Lucio Marineo Siculo mentioned these palatine\r\ndignitaries immediately after the two captains and the two hundred\r\ngentlemen composing the royal body-guard. Consult Mariéjol, _Pierre\r\nMartyr d'Anghera, sa vie et ses oeuvres_, Paris, 1887.]\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to know something of his system of teaching in\r\nwhat proved to be a peripatetic academy, since he and his aristocratic\r\npupils always followed the Court in its progress from city to city;\r\nbut nowhere in his correspondence, teeming with facts and commentaries\r\non the most varied subjects, is anything definite to be gleaned. Latin\r\npoetry and prose, the discourses of Cicero, rhetoric, and church\r\nhistory were important subjects in his curriculum. Though he\r\nfrequently mentions Aristotle in terms of high admiration, it may be\r\ndoubted whether he ever taught Greek. There is no evidence that he\r\neven knew that tongue. Besides the Infante Don Juan, the Duke of\r\nBraganza, Don Juan of Portugal, Villahermosa, cousin to the King, Don\r\nIñigo de Mendoza, and the Marquis of Priego were numbered among his\r\npupils. Nor did his personal influence cease when they left his\r\nclasses. The renascence of learning did not move with the spontaneous,\r\nalmost revolutionary, vigour that characterised the revival in Italy,\r\nnor was Peter Martyr of the paganised scholars in whom the cult\r\nfor antiquity had undermined Christian faith--else had he not been\r\nacceptable to Queen Isabella.\r\n\r\nSome authors, including Ranke, have described him as occupying the\r\npost of Secretary of Latin Letters. Officially he never did. His\r\nknowledge of Latin, in a land where few were masters of the language\r\nof diplomatic and literary intercourse, was brought into frequent\r\nservice, and it was no uncommon thing for him to turn the Spanish\r\ndraft of a state paper or despatch into Latin.[6] He refused a chair\r\nin the University of Salamanca, but consented on one occasion to\r\ndeliver a lecture before its galaxy of distinguished professors and\r\nfour thousand students. He chose for his subject the second satire of\r\nJuvenal, and for more than an hour held his listeners spellbound under\r\nthe charm of his eloquence. He thus described his triumph: _Domum\r\ntanquam ex Olympo victorem primarii me comitantur_.[7]\r\n\r\n[Note 6: _Talvolta era incaricato di voltare in latino le\r\ncorrespondenze diplomatiche pin importanti. I ministri o i lor\r\nsegretari ne faceano la minuta in ispagnuolo, ed egli le recava nella\r\nlingua che era allora adoperata come lingua internazionale_. Ciampi,\r\n_Nuova Antologia_, tom, iii., p. 69.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7: _Opus Epistolarum_. Ep. lvii.]\r\n\r\nDuring these prosperous years in Spain, the promise made to Cardinal\r\nAscanio Sforza was faithfully kept, though the latter's early fall\r\nfrom his high estate in Rome diverted Martyr's letters to other\r\npersonages. With fervent and unflagging interest he followed the swift\r\nmarch of disastrous events in his native Italy. The cowardly murder\r\nof Gian Galeazzo by his perfidious and ambitious nephew, Lodovico il\r\nMoro; the death of the magnificent Lorenzo in Florence; the accession\r\nto power of the unscrupulous Borgia family, with Alexander VI. upon\r\nthe papal throne; the French invasion of Naples--all these and other\r\nsimilar calamities bringing in their train the destruction of Italy,\r\noccupied his attention and filled his correspondence with lamentations\r\nand sombre presages for the future.\r\n\r\nHe was the first to herald the discovery of the new world, and to\r\npublish the glory of his unknown compatriot to their countrymen. To\r\nCount Giovanni Borromeo he wrote concerning the return of Columbus\r\nfrom his first voyage: ..._rediit ab Antipodibus occiduis\r\nChristophorus quidam Colonus, vir ligur, qui a meis regibus ad hanc\r\nprovinciam tria vix impetraverat navigia, quia fabulosa, que dicebat,\r\narbitrabantur; rediit preciosum multarum rerum sed auri precipue,\r\nqua suapte natura regiones generant tulit_. Significant is the\r\nintroduction of the great navigator: _Christophorus quidam Colonus,\r\nvir ligur_. There was nothing more to know or say about the sailor\r\nof lowly origin and obscure beginnings, whose great achievement shed\r\nglory on his unconscious fatherland and changed the face of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1497 Peter Martyr was designated for a diplomatic mission\r\nthat gratified his ambition and promised him an opportunity to revisit\r\nRome and Milan.\r\n\r\nLadislas II., King of Bohemia, sought to repudiate his wife Beatrice,\r\ndaughter of King Ferdinand of Naples, and widow of Matthias Corvinus,\r\nKing of Hungary. Being a princess of Aragon, the outraged lady's\r\nappeal in her distress to her powerful kinsman in Spain found\r\nFerdinand of Aragon disposed to intervene in her behalf. It was to\r\nchampion her cause that Peter Martyr was chosen to go as ambassador\r\nfrom the Catholic sovereigns to Bohemia, stopping on his way at Rome\r\nto lay the case before the Pope. In the midst of his preparations for\r\nthe journey the unwelcome and disconcerting intelligence that Pope\r\nAlexander VI. leaned rather to the side of King Ladislas reached\r\nSpain. This gave the case a new and unexpected complexion. The Spanish\r\nsovereigns first wavered and then reversed their decision. The\r\nembassy was cancelled and the disappointed ambassador cheated of the\r\ndistinction and pleasure he already tasted in anticipation.\r\n\r\nFour years later circumstances rendered an embassy to the Sultan of\r\nEgypt imperative. Ever since the fall of Granada, which was followed\r\nby the expulsion of Moors and Jews from Spain or their forcible\r\nconversion to Christianity if they remained in the country, the\r\nMussulman world throughout Northern Africa had been kept in a ferment\r\nby the lamentations and complaints of the arriving exiles. Islam\r\nthrobbed with sympathy for the vanquished, and thirsted for vengeance\r\non the oppressors. The Mameluke Sultan of Egypt, aroused to action by\r\nthe reports of the persecution of his brethren in blood and faith,\r\nthreatened reprisals, which he was in a position to carry out on\r\nthe persons and property of the numerous Christian merchants in the\r\nLevant, as well as on the pilgrims who annually visited the Holy Land.\r\nThe Franciscan friars, guardians of the holy places in Palestine, were\r\nespecially at his mercy. Representations had been made in Rome and\r\nreferred by the Pope to Spain. King Ferdinand temporised, denying the\r\ntruth of the reports of persecution and alleging that no oppressive\r\nmeasures had been adopted against the Moors, describing whatever\r\nhardships they may have suffered as unavoidably incidental to the\r\nreorganisation of the recently acquired provinces. His tranquillising\r\nassurances were not accepted with unreserved credence by the Sultan.\r\nBy the year 1501, the situation had become so strained, owing to the\r\nknowledge spread through the Mussulman world that an edict of general\r\nexpulsion was in preparation, that it was decided to despatch an\r\nembassy to soothe the Sultan's angry alarm and to protect, if\r\npossible, the Christians within his dominions from the threatened\r\nvengeance. For this delicate and novel negotiation, Peter Martyr was\r\nchosen. The avowed object of his mission has been suspected of masking\r\nsome undeclared purpose, though what this may have been is purely a\r\nmatter of conjecture. He was also entrusted with a secret message to\r\nthe Doge and Senate of Venice, where French influences were felt to be\r\nat work against the interests of Spain. Travelling by way of Narbonne\r\nand Avignon, the ambassador reached Venice a few days after the death\r\nof the Doge, Barbarigo, and before a successor had been elected.\r\nBrief as was his stay in the city of lagoons, every hour of it was\r\nprofitably employed. He visited churches, palaces, and convents,\r\ninspecting their libraries and art treasures; he was enraptured by the\r\nbeauty and splendour of all he beheld. Nothing escaped his searching\r\ninquiries concerning the form of government, the system of elections,\r\nthe ship-building actively carried on in the great arsenal, and the\r\nextent and variety of commercial intercourse with foreign nations.\r\nMention of his visit is made in the famous diary of the younger Marino\r\nSanuto.[1]\r\n\r\n[Note 1: _A di 30 Septembris giunse qui uno orator dei reali di\r\nSpagna; va al Soldano al Cairo; qual montó su le Gallie nostre di\r\nAlessandria; si dice per prepare il Soliano relaxi i frati di Monte\r\nSyon e li tratti bene, e che 30 mila. Mori di Granata si sono\r\nbaptizati di sua volontá, e non coacti_.]\r\n\r\nDelightful and absorbing as he undoubtedly found it to linger amidst\r\nthe glories of Venice, the ambassador was not forgetful that the\r\nimportant purpose of his mission lay elsewhere. Delivering his message\r\nto the Senate, he crossed to Pola (Pula), where eight Venetian ships lay,\r\nready to sail to various ports in the Levant. The voyage to Egypt\r\nproved a tempestuous one, and it was the twenty-third of December when\r\nthe storm-beaten vessel safely entered the port of Alexandria, after\r\na narrow escape from being wrecked on the rocky foundations of the\r\nfamous Pharos of antiquity. Christian merchants trading in the Levant\r\nwere at that period divided into two groups, one of which was under\r\nthe protection of Venice, the other, in which were comprised all\r\nSpanish subjects, being under that of France. The French consul,\r\nFelipe de Paredes, a Catalonian by birth, offered the hospitality of\r\nhis house pending the arrival of the indispensable safe-conduct and\r\nescort from the Sultan. In the _Legatio Babylonica_, Peter Martyr\r\ndescribes, with lamentations, the squalor of the once splendid city of\r\nAlexandria, famous for its beautiful gardens, superb palaces, and rich\r\nlibraries. The ancient capital of the Ptolemies was reduced to a mere\r\nremnant of its former size, and of its former glories not a vestige\r\nwas perceptible.[2] Cansu Alguri[3] reigned in Cairo. A man personally\r\ninclined to toleration, his liberty of action was fettered by the\r\nfanaticism of his courtiers and the Mussulman clergy. The moment was\r\nnot a propitious one for an embassy soliciting favours for Christians.\r\nThe Portuguese had but recently sunk an Egyptian vessel off Calicut,\r\ncommercial rivalries were bitter, and the harsh treatment of the\r\nconquered Moors in Spain had aroused religious antagonism to fever\r\npitch and bred feelings of universal exasperation against the foes of\r\nIslam.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Writing to Pedro Fajardo he thus expressed himself:\r\n_Alexandriam sepe perambulavi: lacrymosum est ejus ruinas intueri;\r\ncentum millium atque eo amplius domorum uti per ejus vestigere licet\r\ncolligere meo judicio quondam fuit Alexandria; nunc quatuor vix\r\nmillibus contenta est focis; turturibus nunc et columbis pro\r\nhabitationibus nidos prestat, etc_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3: Also spelled Quansou Ghoury and Cansa Gouri; Peter Martyr\r\nwrites _Campsoo Gauro_.]\r\n\r\nFrom Rosetta Peter Martyr started on January 26th on his journey to\r\nthe Egyptian Babylon,[4] as he was pleased to style Cairo, travelling\r\nby boat on the Nile and landing at Boulaq in the night. The next\r\nmorning a Christian renegade, Tangriberdy by name, who held the\r\nimportant office of Grand Dragoman to the Sultan, presented himself to\r\narrange the ceremonial to be observed at the audience with his master.\r\nThis singular man, a Spanish sailor from Valencia, had been years\r\nbefore wrecked on the Egyptian coast and taken captive. By forsaking\r\nhis faith he saved his life, and had gradually risen from a state\r\nof servitude to his post of confidence near the Sultan's person.\r\nTangriberdy availed himself of the opportunity afforded by his duties,\r\nto relate to the ambassador the story of his life and his forcible\r\nconversion, declaring that, in his heart, he clung to the Christian\r\nfaith and longed to return to his native Spain. Whether his sentiments\r\nwere sincere or feigned, his presence in an influential capacity\r\nat the Sultan's court was a fortuitous circumstance of which the\r\nambassador gladly took advantage. The audience was fixed for the\r\nfollowing morning at daybreak, and that night Tangriberdy lodged the\r\nembassy in his own palace.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Cairo was thus called in the Middle Ages, the name\r\nbelonging especially to one of the city's suburbs. See _Quatremère\r\nMémoires geographiques te historiques sur l'Egypt_. Paris, 1811.]\r\n\r\nTraversing the streets of Cairo, thronged with a hostile crowd curious\r\nto view the _giaour_, Peter Martyr, accompanied by the Grand Dragoman\r\nand his Mameluke escort, mounted to the citadel, where stood the\r\nstately palace built by Salah-Eddin. After crossing two courts he\r\nfound himself in a third, where sat the Sultan upon a marble dais\r\nrichly draped and cushioned. The prostrations exacted by Eastern\r\netiquette were dispensed with, the envoy being even invited to sit in\r\nthe august presence. Thrice the Sultan assured him of his friendly\r\ndisposition; no business was transacted, and after these formalities\r\nthe ambassador withdrew as he had come, a second audience being fixed\r\nfor the following Sunday.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the envoys from the Barbary States, who were present for\r\nthe purpose of defeating the negotiations, excited the populace by\r\nappeals to their fanaticism, reminding them of the cruelties endured\r\nby their brethern of the true faith at the hands of Spaniards. They\r\neven declared that if Cansu Alguri consented to treat with the\r\ninfidels, he was no true son of Islam. A council of military chiefs\r\nwas summoned which quickly decided to demand the immediate dismissal\r\nof the Christian ambassador. Tangriberdy, who sought to alter this\r\ndetermination, was even threatened with death if he persisted in his\r\nopposition. Remembering that he owed his throne to the Mamelukes, who\r\nhad exalted and destroyed no less than four Sultans within as many\r\nyears, Cansu Alguri quailed before the outburst of popular fury. He\r\nordered Tangriberdy to conduct the obnoxious visitor from the capital\r\nwithout further delay. Peter Martyr, however, received this intimation\r\nwith unruffled calm and, to the stupefaction of Tangriberdy, refused\r\nto leave until he had accomplished his mission. Such audacity in a\r\nmild-mannered ecclesiastic was as impressive as it was unexpected. The\r\nGrand Dragoman had no choice but to report the refusal to the Sultan.\r\nBy what arguments he prevailed upon Cansu Alguri to rescind his\r\ncommand, we know not, but a secret audience was arranged in which\r\nMartyr describes himself as speaking with daring and persuasive\r\nfrankness to the Sultan. He availed himself in the most ample manner\r\nof diplomatic license in dealing with facts, and succeeded in\r\nconvincing his listener that no Moors had been forced to change their\r\nreligion, that the conquest of Granada was but the re-establishment of\r\nSpanish sovereignty over what had been taken by conquest, and\r\nfinally that nobody had been expelled from the country, save lawless\r\nmarauders, who refused to abide by the terms of the fair treaty of\r\npeace concluded between Boabdil and the Catholic sovereigns. He closed\r\nhis plea by adroitly introducing a scapegoat in the person of the\r\nuniversally execrated Jew, against whom it was the easiest part of his\r\nmission to awaken the dormant hatred and contempt of the Sultan. Into\r\nwilling Mussulman ears he poured a tirade of abuse, typical of the\r\nepoch and the nation he represented: ..._proh si scires quam morbosum,\r\nquam pestiferum; quamque contagiosum pecus istud de quo loqueris sit,\r\ntactu omnia fedant, visu corrumpunt sermone destruunt, divina et\r\nhumana preturbant, inficiunt, prostrant miseros vicinos circumveniunt,\r\nradicitus expellant, funestant; ubicumque pecunias esse presentiunt,\r\ntamquam odori canes insequunt; detegunt, effundiunt, per mendacia,\r\nperjuria, dolos insidias per litas, si catera non seppelunt,\r\nextorquere illas laborant: aliena miseria, dolore, gemitu, mestitia\r\ngaudent_. With every word of this diatribe, the representative of the\r\nProphet was in perfect agreement. United in the bonds of a common\r\nhatred, than which no union is closer, a treaty between the two powers\r\nwas easily concluded. The military chiefs were converted to the\r\nadvantages of friendly relations with Spain, and means were devised to\r\ncalm the popular excitement.\r\n\r\nAssisted by some monks of the Mount Sion community, the successful\r\nambassador drafted the concessions he solicited, all of which were\r\ngraciously accorded by the mollified Egyptians. Christians were\r\nhenceforth to be permitted to rebuild and repair the ruined\r\nsanctuaries throughout the Holy Land; the tribute levied on pilgrims\r\nwas lightened and guaranties for their personal safety were given. It\r\nis noteworthy that only religious interests received attention, no\r\nmention being made of commercial privileges. More noteworthy still, is\r\nthe absence of anything tangible given by the adroit envoy in exchange\r\nfor what he got. The Sultan was reassured as to the status of such\r\nMoors as might remain under Spanish rule, and was encouraged to\r\ncount upon unspecified future advantages from the friendship of King\r\nFerdinand. A truly singular result of negotiations begun under such\r\nunfavourable auspices, though the value of concessions, to\r\nthe observance of which nothing constrained the Sultan, seems\r\nproblematical, and was certainly less than the ambassador, in his\r\nnaive vanity, hastened to assume and proclaim.\r\n\r\nWhile the text of the treaty was being prepared, Peter Martyr occupied\r\nhimself in collecting information concerning the mysterious land where\r\nhe found himself. Egypt was all but unknown to his contemporaries,\r\nwhose most recent information concerning the country was derived from\r\nthe writings of the ancients. The _Legatio Babylonica_, consisting of\r\nthree reports to the Spanish sovereigns, to which addenda were later\r\nmade, contains a mass of historical and geographical facts, of which\r\nEuropeans were ignorant; nothing escaped the ambassador's omnivorous\r\ncuriosity and discerning scrutiny, during what proved to be a\r\nveritable voyage of discovery. He treats of the flora and fauna of\r\nthe country; he studied and noted the characteristics of the great\r\nlife-giver of Egypt--the Nile. The Mamelukes engaged his particular\r\nattention, though much of the information furnished him about them was\r\nerroneous. He plunged into antiquity, visited, measured, and described\r\nthe Sphinx and the Pyramids--also with many errors. Christian\r\ntradition and pious legends have their place in his narrative,\r\nespecially that of Matarieh--_ubi Christus latuerat_ when carried\r\nby his parents into Egypt to escape the Herodian massacre of the\r\nInnocents.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-first of February, Peter Martyr, escorted by a guard of\r\nhonour composed of high court officials and respectfully saluted by\r\na vast concourse of people, repaired to the palace for his farewell\r\naudience. In taking an affectionate leave of him, the Sultan presented\r\nhim with a gorgeous robe, heavy with cunningly-wrought embroideries.\r\nChristian and Mussulman were friends. Six days later he left the\r\ncapital for Alexandria, where he embarked on April 22d for Venice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nLeonardo Loredano had meantime been elected Doge in succession to\r\nthe deceased Agostino Barbarigo. Spanish interests in the kingdom of\r\nNaples were seriously compromised, and the diligence of the French\r\nenvoys threatened to win Venice from the neutral policy the Republic\r\nhad adopted and convert it into an ally of Louis XII.\r\n\r\nOn June 30th, Peter Martyr landed in Venice and immediately sought\r\naudience of the new Doge, to whom he repeated the message he had\r\ndelivered a few months before to the Senate. Perceiving the headway\r\nmade by French influence, he wrote to Spain, explaining the situation\r\nand urging the sovereigns immediately to despatch an embassy to\r\ncounteract the mischievous activity of the French. He offered, as\r\nan alternative, to himself assume the negotiations if the requisite\r\ninstructions were sent to him. King Ferdinand ignored the proffer of\r\nservice, but, acting upon the information sent him, entrusted the\r\nbusiness to Lorenzo Suarez de Figueroa, who had been his ambassador\r\nin Venice in 1495. Zealous for his adopted country and, possibly,\r\noverconfident in consequence of his easy success in Egypt, Peter\r\nMartyr did not wait for the credentials he had solicited but made the\r\nmistake of treating affairs for which he had received no mandate. The\r\nFrench envoys were quick to detect his opposition, and as prompt to\r\ntake advantage of the false position in which the diplomatic\r\nnovice had unwarily placed himself. His unaccredited presence and\r\nofficiousness in the capital of the Doges were made to appear both\r\noffensive and ridiculous. The adherents of the French party denounced\r\nhim as an intriguer, and spread the report that he was a spy in the\r\npay of Spain. His position speedily became intolerable, unsafe even,\r\nand he was forced to escape secretly from the city; nor did he stop\r\nuntil he reached his native Lombardy, where he might rely upon the\r\nprotection of his kinsmen, the Marshal Trivulzio and the Borromeos, to\r\nshield him from the consequences of his indiscretion.\r\n\r\nHe writes with emotion of the visit he paid to his native town of\r\nArona and the scenes of his childhood, where he renewed acquaintance\r\nwith the charms of one of the loveliest landscapes in Italy. He\r\nyielded to early memories, and the gentle dream of one day returning\r\nto the shores of Maggiore, there to pass his declining years, took\r\nshape in his fancy. When peace between France and Spain was later\r\nrestored, after King Ferdinand's marriage to the Princess Germaine\r\nde Foix, he obtained the King's intercession to procure for him the\r\nabbacy of St. Gratian at Arona. He himself solicited the protection\r\nof the Cardinal d'Amboise to obtain him this favour, declaring the\r\nrevenues from the abbacy were indifferent to him, as he would only use\r\nthem to restore to its pristine splendour the falling church in which\r\nreposed the holy relics of SS. Gratian, Fidelius, and Carpophorus.\r\nThe peace between the two countries was too ephemeral to permit the\r\nrealisation of his pious hope.\r\n\r\nThe Marshal Trivulzio accompanied his kinsman to Asti and from\r\nthence to Carmagnola where they obtained an audience of the Cardinal\r\nd'Amboise, Legate for France. Despite his undisguised hostility to\r\nSpaniards, the Legate furnished the ambassador with a safe-conduct\r\nover the frontier into Spain.\r\n\r\nIf the Catholic monarchs felt any vexation at the excess of zeal their\r\nenvoy had displayed in Venice, they betrayed none. Peter Martyr's\r\nreception was not wanting in cordiality, the Queen, especially,\r\nexpressing her gratitude for the important service he had rendered\r\nthe Christian religion, and he received another appointment[1] which\r\naugmented his income by thirty thousand maravedis yearly. Having taken\r\nholy orders about this time and the dignity of prior of the cathedral\r\nchapter of Granada falling vacant, this benefice was also given to\r\nhim, _regis et reginæ beneficentia_.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: _Maestro de los cabelleros de su corte en las artes\r\nliberates_. He had long exercised the functions of this office, as\r\nhas been described: the formal appointment was doubtless but a means\r\ninvented for granting him an increase of revenue.]\r\n\r\nOn November 26th in the year 1504, the death of Isabella of Castile\r\nplunged the Court and people into mourning and produced a crisis in\r\nthe government that threatened the arduously accomplished union of\r\nthe peninsula with disruption. None mourned the Queen's death more\r\nsincerely than did her Italian chaplain. He accompanied the funeral\r\ncortège on its long journey to Granada, where the body was laid in the\r\ncathedral of the city her victorious arms had restored to the bosom\r\nof Christendom. During several months, Martyr lingered in Granada,\r\nhesitating before returning uninvited to King Ferdinand's Court. To a\r\nletter from the Secretary of State, Perez Almazen, summoning him to\r\nrejoin the King without delay, he somewhat coyly answered, deprecating\r\nhis ability to be of further service to His Majesty, adding, however,\r\nthat he asked nothing better than to obey the summons. Elsewhere,\r\nin one of his Epistles, he states that he returned to the court at\r\nSegovia, as representative of his chapter, to secure the continuation\r\nof certain revenues paid from the royal treasury to the clergy of\r\nGranada.\r\n\r\nThe political situation created by the Queen's death was both\r\nperplexing and menacing.[2] Doña Juana, wife of the Archduke Philip,\r\ninherited the crown of Castile from her mother in default of male\r\nheirs, but her mental state excluded the possibility of her assuming\r\nthe functions of government. Already during her mother's lifetime, the\r\nhealth of this unhappy princess, who has passed into history under the\r\ntitle of Juana the Mad, gave rise to serious anxiety. Deserted by the\r\nhandsome and frivolous Philip at a time when she most required his\r\npresence, she sank into a state of profound melancholy. She waited, in\r\nvain, for the return of the husband whom her unreasoning jealousy and\r\namorous importunities had driven from her.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: The Infante Don Juan died in October, 1497, shortly after\r\nhis early marriage with the Archduchess Margaret of Austria, and\r\nwithout issue. Isabella, Queen of Portugal, died after giving birth to\r\na son, in whom the three crowns of Portugal, Castile, and Aragon would\r\nhave been united had the prince not expired in 1500, while still a\r\nchild. Doña Juana, second daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella and next\r\nheir, had married, in 1496, the Archduke Philip of Austria, Duke of\r\nBurgundy, and became the mother of Charles I. of Spain, commonly known\r\nby his imperial title of Charles V.]\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the late Queen's wishes, Ferdinand hastened to\r\nproclaim his daughter and Philip sovereigns of Castile, reserving to\r\nhimself the powers of regent. He was willing to gratify the archduke's\r\nvanity by conceding him the royal title, while keeping the government\r\nin his own hands, and had there been no one but his absent son-in-law\r\nwith whom to reckon, his policy would have stood a fair chance of\r\nsuccess. It was thwarted by the intrigues of a powerful faction\r\namongst the aristocracy, who deemed the opportunity a promising one\r\nfor recovering some of the privileges of which they had been shorn.\r\n\r\nFerdinand of Aragon had gained little hold on the affections of the\r\npeople of his wife's dominions, hence his position became one of\r\nextreme difficulty. His opponents urged the archduke to hasten his\r\narrival in Spain and to assume the regency in the name of his invalid\r\nwife. Rumours that Louis XII. had accorded his son-in-law permission\r\nto traverse France at the head of a small army rendered the regency\r\ninsecure, and to forestall the complication of a possible alliance\r\nbetween Philip and King Louis, Ferdinand, despite his advanced age and\r\nthe recent death of his wife, asked the hand of a French princess,\r\nGermaine de Foix, in marriage, offering to settle the crown of Naples\r\nupon her descendants. To conciliate Philip, he proposed to share with\r\nhim the regency. Upon the arrival of the latter at Coruña in the month\r\nof May, Martyr was chosen by the King to repair thither and obtain\r\nthe archduke's adhesion to this proposal. That the latter had\r\ndistinguished the Italian savant by admitting him to his intimacy\r\nduring his former stay in Spain, did not save the mission from\r\nfailure, and where Peter Martyr failed, Cardinal Ximenes was later\r\nequally unsuccessful. Ferdinand ended by yielding and, after a final\r\ninterview with his son-in-law in Remesal, at which Peter Martyr was\r\npresent, he left Spain on his way to Naples, the latter remaining with\r\nthe mad queen to observe and report the course of events.\r\n\r\nThe sudden death of King Philip augmented the unrest throughout the\r\ncountry, for the disappearance of this ineffective sovereign left the\r\nstate without even a nominal head. Ferdinand, who had reached Porto\r\nFino when the news was brought to him, made no move to return,\r\nconfident that the Castilians would soon be forced to invite him to\r\nresume the government; on the contrary, he tranquilly continued his\r\njourney to Naples. Rivals, he had none, for his grandson, Charles,\r\nwas still a child, while the unfortunate Juana passed her time in\r\ncelebrating funeral rites for her dead husband, whose coffin she\r\ncarried about with her, opening it to contemplate the body, of which\r\nshe continued to be so jealous that all women were kept rigorously at\r\na distance. A provisional government, formed to act for her, consisted\r\nof Cardinal Ximenes, the Constable of Castile and the Duke of Najera,\r\nbut inspired little confidence. Peter Martyr perceived that, besides\r\nFerdinand, there was no one capable of restoring order and governing\r\nthe state. He wrote repeatedly to the secretary, Perez Almazen, and to\r\nthe King himself, urging the latter's speedy return as the country's\r\nonly salvation from anarchy. Events proved the soundness of his\r\njudgment, for the mere news of the King's landing at Valencia sufficed\r\nto restore confidence; he resumed the regency unopposed and continued\r\nto govern Castile, in his daughter's name, until his own death.\r\n\r\nDoña Juana ceased her lugubrious peregrinations and took up her\r\nresidence in the monastery of Santa Clara at Tordesillas, where she\r\nconsented to the burial of her husband's body in a spot visible from\r\nher windows. Peter Martyr was one of the few persons who saw the\r\nunhappy lady and even gained some influence over her feeble mind.\r\nMazzuchelli states that, at one period, there were but two bishops and\r\nPeter Martyr to whom the Queen consented even to listen. Now and\r\nagain the figure of the insane queen appears like a pallid spectre in\r\nMartyr's pages. Her caprices and vagaries are noted from time to time\r\nin the _Opus Epistolarum_; indeed the story of her sufferings is all\r\nthere. The insanity of Doña Juana was not seriously doubted by her\r\ncontemporaries--certainly not by Martyr, whose portrait of her\r\ncharacter is perhaps the most accurate contemporary one we possess.\r\nHe traces her malady from its incipiency, through the successive\r\ndisquieting manifestations of hysteria, melancholia, and fury,\r\nbroken by periods of partial and even complete mental lucidity. Such\r\nintervals became rarer and briefer as time went on.[3]\r\n\r\n[Note 3: The efforts of the historian Bergenroth to establish\r\nDoña Juana's sanity and to depict her as the victim of religious\r\npersecution because of her suspected orthodoxy have been conclusively\r\nrefuted by Maurenbrecher, Gachard, and other writers, who have\r\ndemolished his arguments and censured his methods of research\r\nand interpretation. The last mention of Doña Juana in the _Opus\r\nEpistolarum_ occurs in Epistle DCCCII. Peter Martyr describes the\r\nvisit paid her by her daughter Isabella, who was about to be married\r\nto the Infante of Portugal. The insanity of the Queen was used as a\r\npolitical pawn by both her husband and her father, each affirming or\r\ndenying as it suited his purpose for the moment. The husband, however,\r\nwas stronger than the father, for the unhappy Juana would have signed\r\naway her crown at his bidding in exchange for a caress. Consult\r\nHoefler, _Doña Juana_; Gachard, _Jeanne la Folle_; Maurenbrecher,\r\n_Studien und Skizzen zur Geschichte der Reformationszeit_; Pedro de\r\nAlcocer, _Relacion de algunas Cosas_; and Bergenroth's _Calendar of\r\nLetters, Despatches, and State Papers_, etc. (1869).]\r\n\r\nUpon the death of King Ferdinand in 1516, the regency devolved upon\r\nCardinal Ximenes, pending the arrival of the young King, Charles, from\r\nthe Netherlands. The character of Cardinal Ximenes and his methods of\r\ngovernment have been extolled by his admirers and condemned by his\r\nadversaries. The judgment of Peter Martyr is perhaps the least biassed\r\nof any expressed by that statesman's contemporaries. His personal\r\ndislike of the Cardinal did not blind him to his qualities, nor\r\ndull his appreciation of the obstacles with which the latter had to\r\ncontend. In the _Opus Epistolarum_ he seeks, not always with entire\r\nsuccess, to do justice to the great regent. Through his laborious\r\nefforts to be fair to the statesman, there pierces his personal\r\ndislike of the man. Trivial jibes and small criticisms at the\r\nCardinal's expense are not wanting. The writer shared the feeling of\r\nthe Spanish Grandees, that it was \"odious to be governed by a friar.\"\r\nHe also derided the Cardinal's military spirit. One of the regent's\r\nearliest measures suppressed all pensions, but though he excepted\r\nMartyr by name, pending the King's decision, no answer came from the\r\nNetherlands; the Italian fared as did other pensioners, and he\r\nnever forgave the Cardinal. Many of his letters of this period were\r\naddressed to his compatriot, Marliano, who was the young King's\r\ndoctor, and were evidently intended for the monarch's eye. In\r\nthese epistles, adverse judgments and censures of Cardinal Ximenes\r\nfrequently recur, and the writer used the greatest frankness in\r\ndescribing men and events in Spain, and even in offering suggestions\r\nas to the King's policy upon his arrival.\r\n\r\nYielding to the repeated instances of the regent, Charles finally set\r\nout to take possession of his unknown kingdom. He landed, after a\r\ntempestuous voyage, near Gijon, bringing with him a numerous train\r\nof Flemish courtiers and officials, whose primary interest lay in\r\npreventing a meeting between himself and the regent, and whose\r\npresence was destined to cause a serious estrangement between the\r\nmonarch and his Castilian subjects. Their first purpose was easily\r\naccomplished. While the Cardinal awaited him near Roa, the King\r\navoided him by proceeding directly to Tordesillas to visit his mother.\r\nThis ungracious and unmerited snub was applauded by Martyr, who\r\ndismissed the incident with almost flippant mention; nor did he\r\nafterwards touch upon the aged Cardinal's death which occurred\r\nsimultaneously with the reception of the unfeeling message sent by\r\nCharles to the greatest, the most faithful and the most disinterested\r\nof his servants.[4]\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Consult Héfélé, _Vie de Ximenez; Cartas de los\r\nSecretarios del Cardinal_; Ferrer del Rio, _Comunidades de Castilla_;\r\nRanke, _Spanien unter Karl V_.]\r\n\r\nDuring the opening years of his reign, the boy-king proved a docile\r\npupil under the control of his ministers.[5] Peter Martyr wrote of\r\nhim: \"He directs nothing but is himself directed. He has a happy\r\ndisposition, is magnanimous, liberal, generous--but what of it, since\r\nthese qualities contribute to his country's ruin?\" So reserved was the\r\nroyal youth in his manner, so slow of speech, that his mental capacity\r\nbegan to be suspected. People remembered his mother. The story of the\r\ntroubled beginnings of what proved to be one of the most remarkable\r\nreigns in modern history, is related in the _Opus Epistolarum_. The\r\nwriter watched from vantage-ground the conflict of interests, the\r\nstrife of parties; zealous for the welfare of his adopted country,\r\nhe was still a foreigner, identified with no party. Gifted with\r\nrare perspicacity, moderation, and keen judgment, he maintained his\r\nattitude of impartial observation. By temperament and habit he was an\r\naristrocrat--_placet Hispana nobilitas_--he confessed, admitting also\r\nthat _de populo nil mihi curæ_, yet he sided with the _comuneros_\r\nagainst the Crown. While deploring their excesses, he sympathised with\r\nthe cause they defended, and he lashed the insolence and the rapacity\r\nof the Flemish favourites with all the resources of invective and\r\nsarcasm of which he was master. In one of his letters (Ep. 709), he\r\ndescribes the disorders everywhere prevalent throughout the country.\r\n\"The safest roads are no longer secure from brigands and you enrich\r\nbandits and criminals, and oppress honest folks. The ruling power is\r\nnow in the hands of assassins.\" Despite his undisguised hostility to\r\nthe Flemings and his outspoken criticisms on the abuses they fomented,\r\nCharles V. bestowed new honours and emoluments upon the favoured\r\ncounsellor of his grandparents. In September, 1518, the Royal Council\r\nproposed his name to the King as ambassador to Constantinople, there\r\nto treat with the victorious Sultan, whose sanguinary triumphs in\r\nPersia and Egypt were feared to foreshadow an Ottoman invasion of\r\nEurope. Alleging his advanced age and infirmities, the cautious\r\nnominee declined the honour, preferring doubtless to abide by his\r\nfacile diplomatic laurels won in Cairo. There was reason to anticipate\r\nthat the formidable Selim would be found less pliant than Cansu\r\nAlguri. The event proved his wisdom, as Garcia Loaysa who went in his\r\nstead, learned to his cost.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: Guillaume de Croÿ, Sieur de Chièvres, who had been the\r\nyoung prince's governor during his minority, became all powerful in\r\nSpain, where he and his Flemish associates pillaged the treasury,\r\ntrafficked in benefices and offices, and provoked the universal hatred\r\nof the Spaniards. Peter Martyr shared the indignation of his adopted\r\ncountrymen against the King's Flemish parasites. His sympathies for\r\nthe _Comuneros_ were frankly avowed in numerous of his letters.\r\nConsult Hoefler, _Der Aufstand der Castillianischen Städte_;\r\nRobertson, _Charles V_.]\r\n\r\nIn 1520, Peter Martyr was appointed historiographer, an office\r\nyielding a revenue of eighty thousand maravedis. The conscientious\r\ndischarge of the duties of this congenial post, for which he was\r\nconspicuously fitted, won the approval of Mercurino Gattinara, the\r\nItalian chancellor of Charles V. Lucio Marineo Siculo speaks of Martyr\r\nas far back as December, 1510, as _Consiliarius regius_, though\r\nthis title could, at that time, be given him only in his quality of\r\nchronicler of the India Council, his effective membership really\r\ndating from the year 1518. He was later appointed secretary to that\r\nimportant body, which had control over all questions relating to\r\ncolonial expansion in the new world. In 1521 he renewed his efforts to\r\nobtain the abbacy of St. Gratian in Arona, which had been refused him\r\nten years earlier. To his friend, Giovanni di Forli, Archbishop of\r\nCosenza, he wrote, protesting his disinterestedness, adding: \"Don't be\r\nastonished that I covet this abbey: you know I am drawn to it by love\r\nof my native soil.\" It was not to be, and his failure to obtain this\r\nbenefice was one of the severest disappointments of his life. The\r\nambitions of Peter Martyr were never excessive, for he was in all\r\nthings a man of moderation; the honours he obtained, though many, were\r\nsufficiently modest to protect him from the competition and jealousy\r\nof aspiring rivals, yet he would certainly not have refused a\r\nbishopric. After seeing four royal confessors raised to episcopal\r\nrank, he slyly remarked that, \"amongst so many confessors, it would\r\nhave been well to have one Martyr.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[Note 6: \"Tra tanti confessori, sarebbe stato ancora bene un\r\nMartire,\" _Chevroeana_, p. 39. Ed. 1697.]\r\n\r\nArriving in Spain a foreign scholar of modest repute, and dependent on\r\nthe protection of his patron, the Count of Tendilla, Peter Martyr had\r\nrisen in royal favour, until he came to occupy honourable positions in\r\nthe State and numerous benefices in the Church. His services to his\r\nprotectors were valued and valuable. His house, whereever he happened\r\nfor the time to be, was the hospitable meeting-place where statesmen,\r\nnoblemen, foreign envoys, great ecclesiastics, and papal legates came\r\ntogether with navigators and conquerors, cosmographers, colonial\r\nofficials, and returning explorers from antipodal regions--Spain's\r\nempire builders. It was in such society he collected the mass of\r\nfirst-hand information he sifted and chronicled in the Decades and the\r\n_Opus Epistolarum_, which have proven such an inexhaustible mine for\r\nstudents of Spanish and Spanish-American history. Truly of him may it\r\nbe said that nothing human was alien to his spirit. Intercourse with\r\nhim was prized as a privilege by the great men of his time, while he\r\nconverted his association with them to his own and posterity's profit.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Flemish counsellors of Charles V., Adrian of Utrecht,\r\npreceptor of the young prince prior to his accession, had arrived in\r\nSpain in the year 1515 as representative of his interests at King\r\nFerdinand's court. Upon that monarch's death, Adrian, who had meantime\r\nbeen made Bishop of Tortosa and created Cardinal, shared the regency\r\nwith Cardinal Ximenes. A man of gentle manners and scholastic\r\ntraining, his participation in the regency was hardly more than\r\nnominal. Ignorant alike of the Spanish tongue and the intricacies of\r\npolitical life, he willingly effaced himself in the shadow of his\r\nimperious and masterful colleague. Peter Martyr placed his services\r\nentirely at the disposition of Adrian, piloting him amongst the\r\nshoals and reefs that rendered perilous the mysterious sea of Spanish\r\npolitics. When Adrian was elected Pope in 1522, his former mentor\r\nwrote felicitating him upon his elevation and reminding him of the\r\nservices he had formerly rendered him: _Fuistis a me de rebus quæ\r\ngerebantur moniti; nec parum commodi ad emergentia tunc negotia\r\nsignificationes meas Cæsaris rebus attulisse vestra Beatitudo\r\nfatetur_. Although the newly elected Pontiff expressed an amiable wish\r\nto see his old friend in Rome, he offered him no definite position in\r\nCuria. The correspondence that ensued between them was inconclusive;\r\nMartyr, always declaring that he sought no favour, still persisted in\r\nsoliciting a meeting which the Pope discouraged. Adrian accepted his\r\nprotests of disinterestedness literally, and their last meeting at\r\nLogroño was unproductive of aught from the Pope, save expressions\r\nof personal esteem and regard. Peter Martyr excused himself from\r\nfollowing His Holiness to Rome, on the plea of his advanced years and\r\nfailing health. If disappointed at receiving no definite appointment,\r\nhe concealed his chagrin, and, though evidently not desiring his\r\nservices in Curia, one of Adrian's first acts upon arriving in Rome\r\nwas to invest him with the archpriest's benefice of Ocaña in Spain.\r\nThe ever generous King was less niggardly, and, in 1523, conferred\r\nupon Martyr the German title of Pfalzgraf, with the privilege of\r\nnaming imperial notaries and legitimising natural children.\r\n\r\nOn August 15, 1524, the King presented his name to Clement VII. for\r\nconfirmation as mitred abbot of Santiago in the island of Jamaica, a\r\nbenefice rendered vacant by the translation of Don Luis Figueroa to\r\nthe bishopric of San Domingo and La Concepcion.[7] A greater title\r\nwould have doubtless pleased him less, since this one linked his name\r\nwith the Church in the New World, of which he was the first historian.\r\nHe surrendered his priory of Granada to accept the Jamaican dignity,\r\nthe revenues from which he devoted to the construction of the first\r\nstone church built at Sevilla del 'Oro in that island. Above its\r\nportal an inscription bore witness to his generosity: _Petrus Martyr\r\nab Angleria, italus civis mediolanensis, protonotarius apostolicus\r\nhujus insulæ, abbas, senatus indici consiliarius, ligneam priusædem\r\nhanc bis igne consumptam, latericio et quadrato lapide primus a\r\nfundamentis extruxit_.[8]\r\n\r\n[Note 7: The King instructed his ambassador in Rome to propose\r\nLuis Figueroa to succeed Alessandro Geraldino as bishop of Santo\r\nDomingo and Concepcion, and for the vacant abbacy of Jamaica\r\n_presentareis de nuestra parte al protonotario Pedro Mártir de nuestro\r\nConsejo. Dejando tambien Mártir el priorado de Granada que posée_,\r\netc. Coleccion de Indias. vii., 449.]\r\n\r\n[Note 8: Cantu, _Storia Universale_, tom, i., p. 900.]\r\n\r\nIn the month of June, 1526, the Court took up its residence in Granada\r\nwith Peter Martyr, as usual, in attendance. Before the walls of\r\nMoorish Granada he had begun his career in Spain; within the walls of\r\nChristian Granada he was destined to close it and be laid to his final\r\nrest. A sufferer during many years from a disease of the liver, he was\r\naware of his approaching end, and made his will on September 23,[9]\r\nbequeathing the greater part of the property he had amassed to his\r\nnephews and nieces in Lombardy, though none of his friends and\r\nservants in Spain was forgotten. He devoted careful attention to the\r\npreparations for his funeral; eminently a friend of order and decorum,\r\nhe left nothing to chance, but provided for the precise number of\r\nmasses to be said, the exact amount of wax to be consumed, and the\r\nkind of mourning liveries to be worn by his servants. He asked that\r\nhis body should be borne to its grave by the dean and the canons of\r\nthe cathedral, an honour to which his dignity of prior of that chapter\r\nentitled him; but in order to ensure the chapter's participation, as\r\nhe quaintly expressed it, \"with more goodwill,\" he set aside a legacy\r\nof three thousand maravedis as compensation. Not only were his wishes\r\nin this and all respects carried out, but the cathedral chapter\r\nerected a tablet to his memory, upon which an epitaph he would not\r\nhave disdained was inscribed: _Rerum Ætate Nostra Gestarum--Et\r\nNovi Orbis Ignoti Hactenus--Illustratori Petro Martyri\r\nMediolanensi--Cæsareo Senatori--Qui, Patria Relicta--Bella Granatensi\r\nMiles Interfuit--Mox Urbe Capta, Primum Canonico--Deinde Priori\r\nHujus Ecclesiæ--Decanus Et Capitulum--Carissimo Collegae Posuere\r\nSepulchrum--Anno MDXXVI_.[10]\r\n\r\n[Note 9: His last will was published in the _Documentos Ineditos_,\r\ntom, xxxix., pp. 400-414.]\r\n\r\n[Note 10: Harrisse, in his _Christoph Colomb_, fixes upon the 23d\r\nor 24th of September as the date of Martyr's death, believing that his\r\nlast will was executed on his deathbed. There is, however, nothing\r\nthat absolutely proves that such was the fact. The epitaph gives but\r\nthe year. In the _Documentos Ineditos_ the month of September is given\r\nin one place, that of October in another.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Martyr was perhaps the first man in Spain to realise the\r\nimportance of the discovery made by Columbus. Where others beheld but\r\na novel and exciting incident in the history of navigation, he,\r\nwith all but prophetic forecast, divined an event of unique and\r\nfar-reaching importance. He promptly assumed the functions of\r\nhistorian of the new epoch whose dawn he presaged, and in the month\r\nof October, 1494, he began the series of letters to be known as the\r\n_Ocean Decades_, continuing his labours, with interruptions, until\r\n1526, the year of his death. The value of his manuscripts obtained\r\nimmediate recognition; they were the only source of authentic\r\ninformation concerning the New World, accessible to men of letters and\r\npoliticians outside Spain.\r\n\r\nHis material was new and original; every arriving caravel brought\r\nhim fresh news; ship-captains, cosmographers, conquerors of fabulous\r\nrealms in the mysterious west, all reported to him; even the common\r\nsailors and camp-followers poured their tales into his discriminating\r\nears. Las Casas averred that Peter Martyr was more worthy of credence\r\nthan any other Latin writer.[1]\r\n\r\n[Note 1: Las Casas, _Histo. de las Indias_., tom, ii, p. 272: _A\r\nPedro Martyr se le debe was credito que à otro ninguno de los que\r\nescribieran en latin, porque se hallo entonces en Castilla par\r\naquellos tiempos y hablaba con todos, y todos holgaban de le dar\r\ncuenta de lo que vian y hallaban, como à hombre de autioridad y el que\r\ntenia cuidado de preguntarlo_.]\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Columbus returned from his first voyage than Martyr\r\nhastened to announce his success to his friends, Count Tendilla and\r\nArchbishop Talavera. _Meministis Colonum Ligurem institisse in Castris\r\napud reges de percurrendo per occiduos antipodes novo terrarum\r\nhæmisphærio; meminisse opportet_. He was present in Barcelona and\r\nwitnessed the reception accorded the successful discoverer by the\r\nCatholic sovereigns. He, who had gone forth an obscure adventurer upon\r\nwhose purposes, and even sanity, doubts had been cast, returned, a\r\nGrandee of Spain, Admiral of the Ocean, and Viceroy of the Indies. In\r\nthe presence of the court, standing, he, alone, by invitation of the\r\nsovereigns, sat. The ambassadors from his native Republic of Genoa,\r\nMarchisio and Grimaldi, witnessed the exaltation of their fellow\r\ncountryman with eyes that hardly trusted their own vision.\r\n\r\nAn alien amidst the most exclusive and jealous of occidental peoples,\r\nMartyr's abilities and fidelity won a recognition from the successive\r\nmonarchs he served, that was only equalled by the voluntary tributes\r\nof respect and affection paid him by the generation of Spanish nobles\r\nwhose characters he was so influential in forming. Of all the Italians\r\nwho invaded Spain in search of fortune and glory, he was the most\r\nbeloved because he was the most trusted. Government functionaries\r\nsought his protection, Franciscan and Dominican missionaries gave him\r\ntheir confidence and, after he was appointed to a seat in the India\r\nCouncil, he had official cognisance of all correspondence relating to\r\nAmerican affairs. Prior to the appearance in Spain of the celebrated\r\nLetters of Cortes, Peter Martyr's narrative stood alone. Heidenheimer\r\nrightly describes him: _Als echter Kind seiner Zeit, war Peter\r\nMartyr Lehrer und Gelehrter, Soldat und Priester, Schriftsteller und\r\nDiplomat_. It was characteristic of the epoch of the Renaissance\r\nthat a man of culture should embrace all branches of learning, thus\r\nMartyr's observation extended over the broadest field of human\r\nknowledge. Diligent, discriminating, and conscientious, he was keen,\r\nclever, and tactful, not without touches of dry humour, but rarely\r\nbrilliant. Scientific questions, the variations of the magnetic pole,\r\ncalculations of latitude and longitude, the newly discovered Gulf\r\nStream and the _mare sargassum_, and the whereabouts of a possible\r\nstrait uniting the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean, occupied his\r\nspeculations. Likewise are the flora and the fauna of the New World\r\ndescribed to his readers, as they were described to him by the\r\nhome-coming explorers. Pages of his writings are devoted to the\r\ninhabitants of the islands and of the mainland, their customs and\r\nsuperstitions, their religions and forms of government. He has tales\r\nof giants, harpies, mermaids, and sea-serpents. Wild men living in\r\ntrees, Amazons dwelling on lonely islands, cannibals scouring seas and\r\nforests in search of human prey, figure in his narrative. Erroneous\r\nfacts, mistaken judgments due to a credulity that may seem to us\r\ningenuous, are frequent, but it must be borne in mind that he worked\r\nwithout a pre-established plan, his chronicle developing as fresh\r\nmaterial reached him; also that he wrote at a time when the world\r\nseemed each day to expand before the astonished eyes of men, revealing\r\nmagic isles floating on unknown seas, vaster horizons in whose heavens\r\nnovel constellations gleamed; mysterious ocean currents, flowing\r\nwhence no man knew, to break upon the shores of immense continents\r\ninhabited by strange races, living amidst conditions of fabulous\r\nwealth and incredible barbarism. The limits of the possible receded,\r\ndiscrimination between truth and fiction became purely speculative,\r\nsince new data, uninterruptedly supplied, contradicted former\r\nexperience and invalidated accepted theories. The Decades were\r\ncompiled from verbal and written reports from sources the writer was\r\nwarranted in trusting.\r\n\r\nSince geographical surprises are now exhausted, and the division of\r\nland and water on the earth's surface has passed from the sphere of\r\nnavigation into that of politics, no writer will ever again have such\r\nmaterial at his disposition. The arrival of his letters in Italy\r\nwas eagerly awaited and constituted a literary event of the first\r\nmagnitude. Popes sent him messages urging him to continue, the King of\r\nNaples borrowed copies from Cardinal Sforza, and the contents of these\r\nromantic chronicles furnished the most welcome staple of conversation\r\nin palaces and universities. Leo X. had them read aloud during supper,\r\nin the presence of his sister and a chosen group of cardinals. It must\r\nbe noted that the form of the Decades did not escape criticism at the\r\npontifical court, nor did the censures, passed on the liberties he\r\ntook with the tongue of Cicero, fail to reach and sting his ears. In\r\nseveral passages, he defends his use of words taken from the Italian\r\nand Spanish languages. He handled Latin as a living, not as a dead\r\nlanguage, and his style is vigorous, terse, vitalised. He cultivated\r\nbrevity and was chary of lengthy excursions into the classics in\r\nsearch of comparisons and sanctions. His letters frequently show signs\r\nof the haste in which they were composed: sometimes the messenger who\r\nwas to carry them to Rome, was waiting, booted and spurred, in the\r\nante-chamber. Juan Vergara, secretary to Cardinal Ximenes, declared\r\nhis opinion that no more exact and lucid record of contemporary events\r\nexisted than the letters of Peter Martyr, adding that he had himself\r\noften been present and witnessed with what haste they were written, no\r\ncare being taken to correct and polish their style.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated ears of Ciceronian Latinists--such as Cardinal Bembo\r\nwho refused to read the Vulgate for fear of spoiling his style--were\r\nnaturally offended by the phraseology of the Decades. Measured by\r\nstandards so precious, the Latin of Peter Martyr is faulty and crude,\r\nresembling rather a modern dialect than the classical tongue of\r\nancient Rome.[2]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Ciampi's comment is accurate and just: _Non si, puo dire\r\nche sia un latino bellisimo. E quale lo parlavano e scriveano gli\r\nuomini d'affari. A noi é, pero, men discaro che non sia ai forestieri,\r\nin quanta che noi troviamo dentro il movimento, il frassegiare proprio\r\ndella nostra lingua, e sotto la frase incolta latina, indoviniamo\r\nil pensiero nato in italiano che, spogliato da noi della veste\r\nimbarazzanta ci ritorna ignudo si, ma schietto ed efficace_.]\r\n\r\nIt is their substance, not their form, that gives Martyr's writings\r\ntheir value, though his facile style is not devoid of elegance, if\r\nmeasured by other than severely classical standards. Not as a man of\r\nletters, but as an historian does he enjoy the perennial honour to\r\nwhich in life he aspired. Observation is the foundation of history,\r\nand Martyr was pre-eminently a keen and discriminating observer, a\r\ndiligent and conscientious chronicler of the events he observed, hence\r\nare the laurels of the historian equitably his. Similar to the hasty\r\nentries in a journal, daily written, his letters possess an unstudied\r\nfreshness, a convincing actuality, that would undoubtedly have been\r\nmarred by the retouching required to perfect their literary style. The\r\nreproach of carelessness in neglecting to systematise his manuscripts\r\napplies more to the collection in the _Opus Epistolarum_ than to the\r\nletters composing the Decades which we are especially considering, and\r\nlikewise in the former work are found those qualities of lightness\r\nand frivolity, justifying Sir Arthur Helps's description of him as\r\na gossipy man of letters, reminding English readers occasionally of\r\nHorace Walpole and Mr. Pepys. Hakluyt praised his descriptions of\r\nnatural phenomena as excelling those penned by Aristotle, Pliny,\r\nTheophrastus, and Columella.[3]\r\n\r\n[Note 3: Lebrija praised Martyr's verses, declaring him to be\r\nthe best poet amongst the Italians in Spain. One of his poems, Pluto\r\nFurens, was dedicated to Alexander VI., whom he cordially detested and\r\nwhose election to the papal chair he deplored. Unfortunately none of\r\nhis poems has been preserved.]\r\n\r\nAfter a period of partial oblivion, Alexander von Humboldt, in the\r\nearly years of the nineteenth century, rediscovered the neglected\r\nmerits of our author and, by his enlightened criticism and\r\ncommentaries, restored to his writings the consideration they had\r\noriginally enjoyed. Ratified by Prescott, Humboldt's judgment has been\r\nconfirmed by all subsequent historians.\r\n\r\nNo further claim is made for this present translation of the Decades\r\nthan fidelity and lucidity. Its purpose is to render more easily\r\naccessible to English readers, unfamiliar with the original Latin, the\r\nearliest historical work on the New World.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITIONS OF PETER MARTYR'S WORKS\r\n\r\n\r\n_P. Martyris Angli_ [sic] _mediolanensis opera. Legatio Babylonica,\r\nOceani Decas, Poemata, Epigrammata_. Cum privilegio. Impressum Hispali\r\ncum summa diligentia per Jacobum Corumberger Alemanum, anno millesimo\r\nquingentessimo XI, mense vero Aprili, in fol.\r\n\r\nThis Gothic edition contains only the First Decade.\r\n\r\nTwo Italian books compiled from the writings of Peter Martyr antedate\r\nthe above edition of 1511. Angelo Trevisan, secretary to the Venetian\r\nambassador in Spain, forwarded to Domenico Malipiero certain material\r\nwhich he admitted having obtained from a personal friend of Columbus,\r\nwho went as envoy to the Sultan of Egypt. The reference to Peter\r\nMartyr is sufficiently clear. The work of Trevisan appeared in 1504\r\nunder the title, _Libretto di tutta la navigazione del re di Spagna\r\nde le isole et terreni novamente trovati_. Published by Albertino\r\nVercellese da Lisbona. Three years later, in 1507, a compilation\r\ncontaining parts of this same work was printed at Vicenza by\r\nFracanzio, at Milan by Arcangelo Madrignano in 1508, and at Basle\r\nand Paris by Simon Gryneo. The volume was entitled _Paesi novamente\r\nritrovati et Novo Mondo_, etc. Peter Martyr attributed the piracy to\r\nAloisio da Cadamosto, whom he consequently scathingly denounces in the\r\nseventh book of the Second Decade.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1516 the first edition of the Decades, _De rebus oceanis\r\net Orbe Novo Decades tres_, etc., was printed at Alcalá de Henares\r\nunder the supervision of Peter Martyr's friend, the eminent Latinist,\r\nAntonio de Nebrija, who even took care to polish the author's Latin\r\nwhere the composition fell short of his own exacting standard. _Cura\r\net diligentia Antonii Nebrissensis fuerent hæ tres protonotari Petri\r\nMartyris decades impressas in contubernio Arnaldi Guillelmi in\r\nillustri oppido Carpetanæ provinciæ, compluto quod vulgariter dicitur\r\nAlcalà_. Factum est nonis Novembris, anno 1516 in fol. The appearance\r\nof this edition had the character of a veritable literary event and\r\nthe success of the work was immediate and widespread. The narrative\r\ncovered a period of somewhat more than twenty years, beginning with\r\nthe first expedition of Columbus.\r\n\r\nFour years later a Fourth Decade was published by its author, this\r\nbeing the last work he gave to the press during his lifetime. The\r\nearliest known copy was printed in Basle in 1521, the title being _De\r\ninsulis nuper repertis simultaque incolarum moribus_. An Italian and\r\na German edition of the same in 1520 are noted by Harrisse. (Consult\r\n_Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima_, p. 77, Additions, p. 80.)\r\n\r\n_De Insulis nuper inventis Ferdinandi Cortesii ad Carolum V.

Decimo Kalendar\r\nSeptembris.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Decade under the title, _De Insulis nuper inventis_, etc.,\r\nwas republished in Basle in 1533 and again in Antwerp in 1536.\r\n\r\n_De Legatione Babylonica_, Parisiis, 1532, contains also the first\r\nthree Decades.

From the Medallion by Luini,\r\nin the Museum at Milan. Photo by Anderson, Rome.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\nPETER MARTYR, APOSTOLIC PROTONOTARY AND ROYAL COUNSELLOR TO THE\r\nVISCOUNT ASCANIO SFORZA, CARDINAL VICE-CHANCELLOR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a gentle custom of the ancients to number amongst the gods\r\nthose heroes by whose genius and greatness of soul unknown lands were\r\ndiscovered. Since we, however, only render homage to one God in Three\r\nPersons, and consequently may not adore the discoverers of new lands,\r\nit remains for us to offer them our admiration. Likewise should\r\nwe admire the sovereigns under whose inspiration and auspices the\r\nintentions of the discoverers were realised; let us praise the one and\r\nthe other, and exalt them according to their merits.\r\n\r\nAttend now to what is told concerning the recently discovered islands\r\nin the Western ocean. Since you have expressed in your letters a\r\ndesire for information I will, to avoid doing injustice to any one,\r\nrecount the events from their beginnings.\r\n\r\nA certain Christopher Columbus, a Genoese, proposed to the Catholic\r\nKing and Queen, Ferdinand and Isabella, to discover the islands which\r\ntouch the Indies, by sailing from the western extremity of this\r\ncountry. He asked for ships and whatever was necessary to navigation,\r\npromising not only to propagate the Christian religion, but also\r\ncertainly to bring back pearls, spices and gold beyond anything ever\r\nimagined. He succeeded in persuading them and, in response to his\r\ndemands, they provided him at the expense of the royal treasury with\r\nthree ships[1]; the first having a covered deck, the other two being\r\nmerchantmen without decks, of the kind called by the Spaniards\r\n_caravels_. When everything was ready Columbus sailed from the coast\r\nof Spain, about the calends of September in the year 1492, taking with\r\nhim about 220 Spaniards.[2]\r\n\r\n[Note 1: This statement is not absolutely exact, as the funds came\r\nfrom various sources. Columbus, assisted by the Pinzon brothers of\r\nPalos, furnished one eighth of the amount, or the cost of one vessel.\r\nTwo vessels were supplied by the town of Palos, in response to a royal\r\norder; the town owing such service to the crown. The ready money\r\nrequired was advanced by Santangel, receiver of the ecclesiastical\r\nrevenues of Aragon.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: From Palos on August 3d, 1492. The inscription on the\r\nfloor of Seville Cathedral reads: _con tres galeras y 90 personas_. It\r\nfollows that Peter Martyr's figures are exaggerated, for only Oviedo\r\namongst early authorities exceeds the number ninety, and he numbers\r\nthe united crews at 120 men.]\r\n\r\nThe Fortunate Isles, or, as the Spaniards call them, the Canaries,\r\nwere long since discovered in the middle of the ocean. They are\r\ndistant from Cadiz about three hundred leagues; for, according to the\r\nmasters of the art of navigation, each marine league is equal to\r\nfour thousand paces.[3] In ancient times these islands were called\r\nFortunate, because of the mild temperature they enjoyed. The islanders\r\nsuffered neither from the heat of summer nor the rigours of winter:\r\nsome authors consider that the real Fortunate Isles correspond to the\r\narchipelago which the Portuguese have named Cape Verde. If they are at\r\npresent called the Canaries, it is because they are inhabited by men\r\nwho are naked and have no religion. They lie to the south and are\r\noutside European climates. Columbus stopped there to replenish his\r\nsupply of provisions and water, and to rest his crew before starting\r\non the difficult part of his enterprise.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: According to the computations of Columbus, four miles\r\nwere equal to one marine league; the Italian mile, assumed to have\r\nbeen used by him, was equal to 1842 English feet. Fifty-six and\r\ntwo-thirds miles were equal to a degree.]\r\n\r\nSince we are speaking of the Canaries, it may not be thought\r\nuninteresting to recall how they were discovered and civilised. During\r\nmany centuries they were unknown or rather forgotten. It was about\r\nthe year 1405 that a Frenchman called Bethencourt[4] rediscovered\r\nthe seven Canaries. They were conceded to him in gift by the Queen\r\nKatherine, who was Regent during the minority of her son John.\r\nBethencourt lived several years in the archipelago, where he took\r\npossession of the two islands of Lancerote and Fuerteventura, and\r\ncivilised their inhabitants. Upon his death, his heir sold these two\r\nislands to the Spaniards. Afterwards Ferdinando Pedraria and his wife\r\nlanded upon two other of the Canaries, Ferro and Gomera. Within our\r\nown times the Grand Canary was conquered by Pedro de Vera, a Spanish\r\nnobleman from Xeres; Palma and Teneriffe were conquered by Alonzo de\r\nLugo, but at the cost of the royal treasury. The islands of Gomera and\r\nFerro were conquered by the same Lugo, but not without difficulty; for\r\nthe natives, although they lived naked in the woods and had no other\r\narms than sticks and stones, surprised his soldiers one day and killed\r\nabout four hundred of them. He finally succeeded in subduing them, and\r\nto-day the whole archipelago recognises the Spanish authority.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Maciot de Bethencourt. Consult Bergeron, _Histoire de la\r\npremière dêcouverte et conquéte des îles Canaries_; Pascal d'Avezac,\r\n_Notice des dêcouvertes ... dans l'ocêan Atlantique_, etc., Paris,\r\n1845; Viera y Clavigo, _Historia gênêral de las islas de Canaria_,\r\n1773; also the works of Major, Barker-Webb, Sabin Berthelot, and Bory\r\nde St. Vincent.]\r\n\r\nUpon leaving these islands and heading straight to the west, with\r\na slight deviation to the south-west, Columbus sailed thirty-three\r\nsuccessive days without seeing anything but sea and sky. His\r\ncompanions began to murmur in secret, for at first they concealed\r\ntheir discontent, but soon, openly, desiring to get rid of their\r\nleader, whom they even planned to throw into the sea. They considered\r\nthat they had been deceived by this Genoese, who was leading them to\r\nsome place from whence they could never return. After the thirtieth\r\nday they angrily demanded that he should turn back and go no farther;\r\nColumbus, by using gentle words, holding out promises and flattering\r\ntheir hopes, sought to gain time, and he succeeded in calming their\r\nfears; finally also reminding them that if they refused him their\r\nobedience or attempted violence against him, they would be accused of\r\ntreason by their sovereigns. To their great joy, the much-desired land\r\nwas finally discovered.[5] During this first voyage Columbus visited\r\nsix islands, two of which were of extraordinary magnitude; one of\r\nthese he named Hispaniola, and the other Juana,[6] though he was not\r\npositive that the latter was an island. While sailing along the coasts\r\nof these islands, in the month of November, the Spaniards heard\r\nnightingales singing in the dense forests, and they discovered great\r\nrivers of fresh water, and natural harbours sufficient for the largest\r\nfleets. Columbus reconnoitred the coast of Juana in a straight line\r\ntowards the north-west for no less than eight hundred thousand paces\r\nor eighty leagues, which led him to believe that it was a continent,\r\nsince as far as the eye could reach, no signs of any limits to the\r\nisland were perceptible. He decided to return,[7] also because of\r\nthe tumultuous sea, for the coast of Juana towards the north is very\r\nbroken, and at that winter season, the north winds were dangerous to\r\nhis ships. Laying his course eastwards, he held towards an island\r\nwhich he believed to be the island of Ophir; examination of the maps,\r\nhowever, shows that it was the Antilles and neighbouring islands. He\r\nnamed this island Hispaniola. Having decided to land, Columbus put in\r\ntowards shore, when the largest of his ships struck a concealed rock\r\nand was wrecked. Fortunately the reef stood high in the water, which\r\nsaved the crew from drowning; the other two boats quickly approached,\r\nand all the sailors were taken safely on board.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: Land was discovered on the morning of October 12th,\r\nJulian calendar. Efforts to identify the island on which Columbus\r\nfirst landed have been numerous. The natives called it Guanahani and\r\nColumbus named it San Salvador. Muñoz believed it to be the present\r\nWatling's Island; Humboldt and Washington Irving thought Cat Island\r\nmore likely, while Navarrete identified it as Grand Turk. Captain G.V.\r\nFox, U.S.N., published in Appendix 18 to the Report for 1880, the\r\nconclusions he had reached after exhaustive examinations conducted in\r\nthe Bahamas, with which islands and their seas long service had made\r\nhim familiar. He selected Samana or Atwood Cay as the first land\r\ndiscovered.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6: In honour of the Infante Don Juan, heir to the Castilian\r\ncrown. It has, however, always borne its native name of Cuba.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7: But for this infelicitous change in his course, Columbus\r\nmust have discovered the coast of Mexico.]\r\n\r\nIt was at this place that the Spaniards, on landing, first beheld the\r\nislanders. Upon seeing strangers approaching, the natives collected\r\nand fled into the depths of the forests like timid hares pursued by\r\nhounds. The Spaniards followed them, but only succeeded in capturing\r\none woman, whom they took on board their ships, where they gave her\r\nplenty of food and wine and clothes (for both sexes lived absolutely\r\nnaked and in a state of nature); afterwards this woman, who knew where\r\nthe fugitives were concealed, returned to her people, to whom she\r\nshowed her ornaments, praising the liberality of the Spaniards; upon\r\nwhich they all returned to the coast, convinced that the newcomers\r\nwere descended from heaven. They swam out to the ships, bringing gold,\r\nof which they had a small quantity, which they exchanged gladly for\r\ntrifles of glass or pottery. For a needle, a bell, a fragment of\r\nmirror, or any such thing, they gladly gave in exchange whatever gold\r\nwas asked of them, or all that they had about them. As soon as\r\nmore intimate relations were established and the Spaniards came\r\nto understand the local customs, they gathered by signs and by\r\nconjectures that the islanders were governed by kings. When they\r\nlanded from their ships they were received with great honour by these\r\nkings and by all the natives, making every demonstration of homage\r\nof which they were capable. At sunset, the hour of the Angelus, the\r\nSpaniards knelt according to Christian custom, and their example was\r\nimmediately followed by the natives. The latter likewise adored the\r\nCross as they saw the Christians doing.[8]\r\n\r\n[Note 8: The first report Columbus made to the Catholic sovereigns\r\nwas most flattering to the American aborigines. _Certifico a vuestras\r\naltezas que en el mundo creo que no hay mejor gente ni mejor tierra:\r\nellos aman a sus projimos como a si mismo_. Like most generalisations,\r\nthese were found, upon closer acquaintance with native character and\r\ncustoms, to be too comprehensive as well as inaccurate.]\r\n\r\nThese people also brought off the men from the wrecked ship, as well\r\nas all it contained, transporting everything in barques which they\r\ncalled canoes. They did this with as much alacrity and joy as though\r\nthey were saving their own relatives; and certainly amongst ourselves\r\ngreater charity could not have been displayed.\r\n\r\nTheir canoes are constructed out of single tree-trunks, which they dig\r\nout with tools of sharpened stone. They are very long and narrow, and\r\nare made of a single piece of wood. It is alleged that some have been\r\nseen capable of carrying eighty rowers. It has been nowhere discovered\r\nthat iron is used by the natives of Hispaniola. Their houses are most\r\ningeniously constructed, and all the objects they manufacture for\r\ntheir own use excited the admiration of the Spaniards. It is positive\r\nthat they make their tools out of very hard stones found in the\r\nstreams, and which they polish.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards learned that there were other islands not far distant,\r\ninhabited by fierce peoples who live on human flesh; this explained\r\nwhy the natives of Hispaniola fled so promptly on their arrival. They\r\ntold the Spaniards later that they had taken them for the cannibals,\r\nwhich is the name they give to these barbarians. They also call them\r\n_Caraibes_. The islands inhabited by these monsters lie towards the\r\nsouth, and about half-way to the other islands. The inhabitants of\r\nHispaniola, who are a mild people, complained that they were exposed\r\nto frequent attacks from the cannibals who landed amongst them and\r\npursued them through the forests like hunters chasing wild beasts.\r\nThe cannibals captured children, whom they castrated, just as we do\r\nchickens and pigs we wish to fatten for the table, and when they were\r\ngrown and become fat they ate them.[9] Older persons, who fell into\r\ntheir power, were killed and cut into pieces for food; they also ate\r\nthe intestines and the extremities, which they salted, just as we do\r\nhams. They did not eat women, as this would be considered a crime and\r\nan infamy. If they captured any women, they kept them and cared for\r\nthem, in order that they might produce children; just as we do with\r\nhens, sheep, mares, and other animals. Old women, when captured, were\r\nmade slaves. The inhabitants of these islands (which, from now on we\r\nmay consider ours), women and men, have no other means of escaping\r\ncapture by the cannibals, than by flight. Although they use wooden\r\narrows with sharpened points, they are aware that these arms are of\r\nlittle use against the fury and violence of their enemies, and they\r\nall admit that ten cannibals could easily overcome a hundred of their\r\nown men in a pitched battle.\r\n\r\n[Note 9: See Henry Harrisse, _Christophe Colombe_, ii., p. 72.\r\nLetter of Simone Verde to Nicoli.]\r\n\r\nAlthough these people adore the heavens and the stars, their religion\r\nis not yet sufficiently understood; as for their other customs, the\r\nbrief time the Spaniards stopped there and the want of interpreters\r\ndid not allow full information to be obtained. They eat roots which in\r\nsize and form resemble our turnips, but which in taste are similar to\r\nour tender chesnuts. These they call _ages_. Another root which they\r\neat they call _yucca_; and of this they make bread. They eat the ages\r\neither roasted or boiled, or made into bread. They cut the yucca,\r\nwhich is very juicy, into pieces, mashing and kneading it and then\r\nbaking it in the form of cakes. It is a singular thing that they\r\nconsider the juice of the yucca to be more poisonous than that of the\r\naconite, and upon drinking it, death immediately follows. On the other\r\nhand, bread made from this paste is very appetising and wholesome: all\r\nthe Spaniards have tried it. The islanders also easily make bread with\r\na kind of millet, similar to that which exists plenteously amongst the\r\nMilanese and Andalusians. This millet is a little more than a palm in\r\nlength, ending in a point, and is about the thickness of the upper\r\npart of a man's arm. The grains are about the form and size of peas.\r\nWhile they are growing, they are white, but become black when ripe.\r\nWhen ground they are whiter than snow. This kind of grain is called\r\n_maiz_.\r\n\r\nThe islanders set some value on gold and wear it in the form of fine\r\nleaves, fixed in the lobes of their ears and their nostrils. As soon\r\nas our compatriots were certain that they had no commercial relations\r\nwith other peoples and no other coasts than those of their own\r\nislands, they asked them by signs whence they procured the gold. As\r\nnearly as could be conjectured, the natives obtain gold from the sands\r\nof the rivers which flow down from the high mountains. This process\r\nwas not a difficult one. Before beating it into leaves, they form it\r\ninto ingots; but none was found in that part of the island where the\r\nSpaniards had landed. It was shortly afterwards discovered, for when\r\nthe Spaniards left that locality and landed at another point to obtain\r\nfresh water and to fish, they discovered a river of which the stones\r\ncontained flakes of gold.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of three kinds of rabbits, no quadruped is found in\r\nthese islands. There are serpents, but they are not dangerous. Wild\r\ngeese, turtle-doves, ducks of a larger size than ours, with plumage as\r\nwhite as that of a swan, and red heads, exist. The Spaniards brought\r\nback with them some forty parrots, some green, others yellow, and some\r\nhaving vermilion collars like the parrakeets of India, as described by\r\nPliny; and all of them have the most brilliant plumage. Their wings\r\nare green or yellow, but mixed with bluish or purple feathers,\r\npresenting a variety which enchants the eye. I have wished, most\r\nillustrious Prince, to give you these details about the parrots; and\r\nalthough the opinion of Columbus[10] seems to be contradictory to the\r\ntheories of the ancients concerning the size of the globe and its\r\ncircumnavigation, the birds and many other objects brought thence seem\r\nto indicate that these islands do belong, be it by proximity or\r\nby their products, to India; particularly when one recalls what\r\nAristotle, at the end of his treatise _De Cælo et Mundo_, and Seneca,\r\nand other learned cosmographers have always affirmed, that India was\r\nonly separated from the west coast of Spain by a very small expanse of\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n[Note 10: Columbus died in the belief that the countries he\r\nhad discovered formed part of the Indies. They were thus described\r\nofficially by the Spanish sovereigns.]\r\n\r\nMastic, aloes, cotton, and similar products flourish in abundance.\r\nSilky kinds of cotton grow upon trees as in China; also rough-coated\r\nberries of different colours more pungent to the taste than Caucasian\r\npepper; and twigs cut from the trees, which in their form resemble\r\ncinnamon, but in taste, odour, and the outer bark, resemble ginger.\r\n\r\nHappy at having discovered this unknown land, and to have found\r\nindications of a hitherto unknown continent, Columbus resolved to take\r\nadvantage of favouring winds and the approach of spring to return\r\nto Europe; but he left thirty-eight of his companions under the\r\nprotection of the king of whom I have spoken, in order that they\r\nmight, during his absence, acquaint themselves with the country and\r\nits condition. After signing a treaty of friendship with this king\r\nwho was called by his enemies Guaccanarillo,[11] Columbus took all\r\nprecautions for ensuring the health, the life, and the safety of\r\nthe men whom he left behind. The king, touched with pity for these\r\nvoluntary exiles, shed abundant tears, and promised to render them\r\nevery assistance in his power. After mutual embraces, Columbus gave\r\nthe order to depart for Spain. He took with him six islanders,[12]\r\nthanks to whom all the words of their language have been written down\r\nwith Latin characters. Thus they call the heavens _tueri_, a house\r\n_boa_, gold _cauni_, a virtuous man _taino_, nothing _nagani_. They\r\npronounce all these names just as distinctly as we do Latin.\r\n\r\n[Note 11: Otherwise Guacanagari.]\r\n\r\n[Note 12: One of these Indians died at sea on the voyage, and\r\nthree others landed very ill at Palos; the remaining six were\r\npresented to Ferdinand and Isabella at Barcelona, and were afterwards\r\nbaptised.]\r\n\r\nYou are now acquainted with such details concerning this first voyage\r\nas it has seemed expedient to me to record. The King and Queen,\r\nwho, above everything and even in their sleep, thought about the\r\npropagation of the Christian faith, hoping that these numerous and\r\ngentle peoples might be easily converted to our religion, experienced\r\nthe liveliest emotions upon hearing these news. Columbus was received\r\nupon his return with the great honour he merited for what he had\r\naccomplished.[13] They bade him sit in their presence, which for the\r\nSpanish sovereigns is regarded as a proof of the greatest friendship\r\nand the highest mark of gratitude. They commanded that henceforward\r\nColumbus should be called \"_Præfectus Marinus_,\" or, in the Spanish\r\ntongue, _Amiral_. His brother Bartholomew, likewise very proficient in\r\nthe art of navigation, was honoured by them with the title of Prefect\r\nof the Island of Hispaniola, which is in the vulgar tongue called\r\n_Adelantado_.[14] To make my meaning clear I shall henceforth employ\r\nthese usual words of Admiral and Adelantado as well as the terms\r\nwhich are now commonly used in navigation. But let us return to our\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n[Note 13: The historian Oviedo, who was present, describes the\r\nreception of Columbus at Barcelona. _Hist. Nat. de las Indias_, tom.\r\nii., p. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Note 14: This statement is premature; Bartholomew's appointment\r\nwas made considerably later.]\r\n\r\nIt was thought, as Columbus had moreover declared in the beginning,\r\nthat in these islands would be found riches such as all struggle to\r\nobtain. There were two motives which determined the royal pair to plan\r\na second expedition, for which they ordered seventeen ships to be\r\nequipped; three of these were vessels with covered decks, twelve were\r\nof the kind called caravels by the Spaniards, which had none, and\r\ntwo were larger caravels, of which the height of the masts made it\r\npossible to adapt decks. The equipment of this fleet was confided\r\nto Juan de Fonseca, Dean of Seville, a man of illustrious birth, of\r\ngenius and initiative.[15] In obedience to his orders more than twelve\r\nhundred foot-soldiers, amongst whom were all sorts of labourers and\r\nnumerous artisans, were commanded to embark. Some noblemen were found\r\namongst the company. The Admiral took on board mares, sheep, cows and\r\nthe corresponding males for the propagation of their species; nor did\r\nhe forget vegetables, grain, barley, and similar seeds, not only for\r\nprovisions but also for sowing; vines and young plants such as were\r\nwanting in that country were carefully taken. In fact the Spaniards\r\nhave not found any tree in that island which was known to them except\r\npines and palms; and even the palms were extraordinarily high, very\r\nhard, slender, and straight, owing, no doubt, to the fertility of the\r\nsoil. Even the fruits they produce in abundance were unknown.\r\n\r\n[Note 15: The evil that has been attributed to Juan Fonseca, Bishop\r\nof Burgos, may exceed his dues, but the praise here and elsewhere\r\ngiven him by Peter Martyr is excessive and all but unique. That he\r\ncordially hated Columbus and after him Cortes, Las Casas and most of\r\nthe men of action in the New World, is undeniable.]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards declare that there is not in the whole universe a more\r\nfertile region. The Admiral ordered his work people to take with them\r\nthe tools of their trades, and in general everything necessary to\r\nbuild a new city. Won by the accounts of the Admiral and attracted by\r\nthe love of novelty, some of the more intimate courtiers also decided\r\nto take part in this second voyage. They sailed from Cadiz with a\r\nfavourable wind, the seventh day of the calends of October in the year\r\nof grace 1493.[16] On the calends they touched the Canaries. The last\r\nof the Canaries is called Ferro by the Spaniards. There is no potable\r\nwater on it, save a kind of dew produced by one sole tree standing\r\nupon the most lofty point of the whole island; and from which it falls\r\ndrop by drop into an artificial trough. From this island, Columbus put\r\nto sea the third day of the ides of October. We have learned this news\r\na few days after his departure. You shall hear the rest later. Fare\r\nyou well.\r\n\r\n[Note 16: The sailing date was Sept. 25, 1493.]\r\n\r\nFrom the Court of Spain, the ides of November, 1493.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nTO THE VISCOUNT ASCANIO SFORZA, CARDINAL VICE-CHANCELLOR\r\n\r\n\r\nYou renew to me, Most Illustrious Prince, your desire to know all that\r\ntreats of the Spanish discoveries in the New World. You have let me\r\nknow that the details I have given you concerning the first voyage\r\npleased you; listen now to the continuation of events.\r\n\r\nMedina del Campo is a town of Ulterior Spain, as it is called in\r\nItaly, or of Old Castile, as it is called here. It is distant about\r\nfour hundred miles from Cadiz. While the Court sojourned there the\r\nninth day of the calends of April, messengers sent to the King and\r\nQueen informed them that twelve ships returning from the islands had\r\narrived at Cadiz, after a happy voyage. The commander of the squadron\r\ndid not wish to say more by the messengers to the King and Queen\r\nexcept that the Admiral had stopped with five ships and nine hundred\r\nmen at Hispaniola, which he wished to explore. He wrote that he would\r\ngive further details by word of mouth. The eve of the nones of April,\r\nthis commander of the squadron, who was the brother of the nurse of\r\nthe eldest royal princes, arrived at Medina, being sent by Columbus. I\r\nquestioned him and other trustworthy witnesses, and shall now repeat\r\nwhat they told me, hoping by so doing to render myself agreeable to\r\nyou. What I learned from their mouths you shall now in turn learn from\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe third day of the ides of October the Spaniards left the island of\r\nFerro,[1] which is the most distant of the Canaries from Europe, and\r\nput out upon the high seas in seventeen ships. Twenty-one full days\r\npassed before they saw any land; driven by the north wind they were\r\ncarried much farther to the south-west than on the first voyage, and\r\nthus they arrived at the archipelago of the cannibals, or the Caribs,\r\nwhich we only know from the descriptions given by the islanders. The\r\nfirst island they discovered was so thickly wooded that there was\r\nnot an inch of bare or stony land. As the discovery took place on\r\na Sunday, the Admiral wished to call the island Domingo.[2] It was\r\nsupposed to be deserted, and he did not stop there. He calculated that\r\nthey had covered 820 leagues in these twenty-one days. The ships had\r\nalways been driven forward by the south-west wind. At some little\r\ndistance from Domingo other islands were perceived, covered with\r\ntrees, of which the trunks, roots, and leaves exhaled sweet odours.\r\nThose who landed to visit the island found neither men nor animals,\r\nexcept lizards of extraordinarily great size. This island they called\r\nGalana. From the summit of a promontory, a mountain was visible on\r\nthe horizon and thirty miles distant from that mountain a river\r\nof important breadth descended into the plain. This was the first\r\ninhabited land[3] found since leaving the Canaries, but it was\r\ninhabited by those odious cannibals, of whom they had only heard by\r\nreport, but have now learned to know, thanks to those interpreters\r\nwhom the Admiral had taken to Spain on his first voyage.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: The chronology throughout is erroneous. Columbus had sailed\r\nfrom Cadiz on September 25th, arriving at Gomera on October 5th.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: The first island was discovered on November 3d, and was named\r\nLa Deseada, or The Desired; five others, including Domingo and Maria\r\nGalante were discovered on the same date.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3: The island of Guadeloupe, called by the natives Caracueira.]\r\n\r\nWhile exploring the island, numerous villages, composed of twenty or\r\nthirty houses each, were discovered; in the centre is a public square,\r\nround which the houses are placed in a circle. And since I am speaking\r\nabout these houses, it seems proper that I should describe them to\r\nyou. It seems they are built entirely of wood in a circular form. The\r\nconstruction of the building is begun by planting in the earth very\r\ntall trunks of trees; by means of them, shorter beams are placed in\r\nthe interior and support the outer posts. The extremities of the\r\nhigher ones are brought together in a point, after the fashion of\r\na military tent. These frames they then cover with palm and other\r\nleaves, ingeniously interlaced, as a protection against rain. From\r\nthe shorter beams in the interior they suspend knotted cords made of\r\ncotton or of certain roots similar to rushes, and on these they lay\r\ncoverings.[4]\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Hamacs, which are still commonly used in _tierra caliente_\r\nof the West Indies, Mexico, and Central America.]\r\n\r\nThe island produces cotton such as the Spaniards call _algodon_ and\r\nthe Italians _bombasio_. The people sleep on these suspended beds or\r\non straw spread upon the floor. There is a sort of court surrounded by\r\nhouses where they assemble for games. They call their houses _boios_.\r\nThe Spaniards noticed two wooden statues, almost shapeless, standing\r\nupon two interlaced serpents, which at first they took to be the gods\r\nof the islanders; but which they later learned were placed there\r\nmerely for ornament. We have already remarked above that it is\r\nbelieved they adore the heavens; nevertheless, they make out of\r\ncotton-fabric certain masks, which resemble imaginary goblins they\r\nthink they have seen in the night.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to our narrative. Upon the arrival of the Spaniards,\r\nthe islanders, both men and women, abandoned their houses and fled.\r\nAbout thirty women and children whom they had captured in the\r\nneighbouring islands and kept either as slaves or to be eaten, took\r\nrefuge with the Spaniards. In the houses were found pots of all kinds,\r\njars and large earthen vessels, boxes and tools resembling ours. Birds\r\nwere boiling in their pots, also geese mixed with bits of human flesh,\r\nwhile other parts of human bodies were fixed on spits, ready for\r\nroasting. Upon searching another house the Spaniards found arm and\r\nleg bones, which the cannibals carefully preserve for pointing their\r\narrows; for they have no iron. All other bones, after the flesh\r\nis eaten, they throw aside. The Spaniards discovered the recently\r\ndecapitated head of a young man still wet with blood. Exploring the\r\ninterior of the island they discovered seven rivers,[5] without\r\nmentioning a much larger watercourse similar to the Guadalquivir\r\nat Cordoba and larger than our Ticino, of which the banks were\r\ndeliciously umbrageous. They gave the name of Guadaloupe to this\r\nisland because of the resemblance one of its mountains bore to the\r\nMount Guadaloupe, celebrated for its miraculous statue of the Virgin\r\nImmaculate. The natives call their island Caracueira, and it is\r\nthe principal one inhabited by the Caribs. The Spaniards took from\r\nGuadaloupe seven parrots larger than pheasants, and totally unlike any\r\nother parrots in colour. Their entire breast and back are covered with\r\npurple plumes, and from their shoulders fall long feathers of the same\r\ncolour, as I have often remarked in Europe is the case with the capons\r\npeasants raise. The other feathers are of various colours,--green,\r\nbluish, purple, or yellow. Parrots are as numerous in all these\r\nislands as sparrows or other small birds are with us; and just as we\r\nkeep magpies, thrushes, and similar birds to fatten them, so do these\r\nislanders also keep birds to eat, though their forests are full of\r\nparrots.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: In reality, these so-called rivers were unimportant mountain\r\ntorrents.]\r\n\r\nThe female captives who had taken refuge with our people received by\r\nthe Admiral's order some trifling presents, and were begged by signs\r\nto go and hunt for the cannibals, for they knew their place of\r\nconcealment. In fact they went back to the men during the night,\r\nand the following morning returned with several cannibals who were\r\nattracted by the hope of receiving presents; but when they saw our\r\nmen, these savages, whether because they were afraid or because they\r\nwere conscious of their crimes, looked at one another, making a low\r\nmurmur, and then, suddenly forming into a wedge-shaped group, they\r\nfled swiftly, like a flock of birds, into the shady valleys.\r\n\r\nHaving called together his men who had passed some days exploring the\r\ninterior of the island, Columbus gave the signal for departure. He\r\ntook no cannibal with him, but he ordered their boats, dug out of\r\nsingle tree-trunks, to be destroyed, and on the eve of the ides of\r\nNovember he weighed anchor and left Guadaloupe.\r\n\r\nDesiring to see the men of his crew whom he had left the preceding\r\nyear at Hispaniola to explore that country, Columbus passed daily by\r\nother islands which he discovered to the right and left. Straight\r\nahead to the north appeared a large island. Those natives who had been\r\nbrought to Spain on his first voyage, and those who had been delivered\r\nfrom captivity, declared that it was called Madanina, and that it was\r\ninhabited exclusively by women.[6] The Spaniards had, in fact, heard\r\nthis island spoken of during their first voyage. It appeared that the\r\ncannibals went at certain epochs of the year to visit these women,\r\nas in ancient history the Thracians crossed to the island of Lesbos\r\ninhabited by the Amazons. When their children were weaned, they sent\r\nthe boys to their fathers, but kept the girls, precisely as did the\r\nAmazons. It is claimed that these women know of vast caverns where\r\nthey conceal themselves if any man tries to visit them at another than\r\nthe established time. Should any one attempt to force his way into\r\nthese caverns by violence or by trickery, they defend themselves with\r\narrows, which they shoot with great precision. At least, this is the\r\nstory as it is told, and I repeat it to you. The north wind renders\r\nthis island unapproachable, and it can only be reached when the wind\r\nis in the south-west.\r\n\r\n[Note 6: This is the island of Martinique; the legend of its Amazons\r\nis purely fantastic.]\r\n\r\nWhile still in view of Madanina at a distance of about forty miles,\r\nthe Spaniards passed another island, which, according to the accounts\r\nof the natives, was very populous and rich in foodstuffs of all kinds.\r\nAs this island was very mountainous they named it Montserrat. Amongst\r\nother details given by the islanders on board, and as far as could\r\nbe ascertained from their signs and their gestures, the cannibals of\r\nMontserrat frequently set out on hunts to take captives for food, and\r\nin so doing go a distance of more than a thousand miles from their\r\ncoasts. The next day the Spaniards discovered another island, and as\r\nit was of spherical form, Columbus named it Santa Maria Rotunda. In\r\nless time he passed by another island discovered next day, and which,\r\nwithout stopping, he dedicated to St. Martin, and the following day\r\nstill a third island came into view. The Spaniards estimated its width\r\nfrom east to west at fifty miles.\r\n\r\nIt afterwards became known that these islands were of the most\r\nextraordinary beauty and fertility, and to this last one the name of\r\nthe Blessed Virgin of Antigua was given. Sailing on past numerous\r\nislands which followed Antigua, Columbus arrived, forty miles farther\r\non, at an island which surpassed all the others in size, and which the\r\nnatives called Agay. The Admiral gave it the name of Santa Cruz. Here\r\nhe ordered the anchor to be lowered, in order that he might replenish\r\nhis supply of water, and he sent thirty men from his vessel to land\r\nand explore. These men found four dogs on the shore, and the same\r\nnumber of youths and women approached with hands extended, like\r\nsupplicants. It was supposed they were begging for assistance or to be\r\nrescued from the hands of those abominable people. Whatever decision\r\nthe Spaniards might take in regard to them, seemed better to them\r\nthan their actual condition. The cannibals fled as they had done at\r\nGuadaloupe, and disappeared into the forests.\r\n\r\nTwo days were passed at Santa Cruz, where thirty of our Spaniards\r\nplaced in an ambuscade saw, from the place where they were watching, a\r\ncanoe in the distance coming towards them, in which there were eight\r\nmen and as many women. At a given signal they fell upon the canoe; as\r\nthey approached, the men and women let fly a volley of arrows with\r\ngreat rapidity and accuracy. Before the Spaniards had time to protect\r\nthemselves with their shields, one of our men, a Galician, was killed\r\nby a woman, and another was seriously wounded by an arrow shot by that\r\nsame woman. It was discovered that their poisoned arrows contained a\r\nkind of liquid which oozed out when the point broke. There was one\r\nwoman amongst these savages whom, as nearly as could be conjectured,\r\nall the others seemed to obey, as though she was their queen. With her\r\nwas her son, a fierce, robust young man, with ferocious eyes and a\r\nface like a lion's. Rather than further expose themselves to their\r\narrows, our men chose to engage them in a hand to hand combat. Rowing\r\nstoutly, they pushed their barque against the canoe of the savages,\r\nwhich was overturned by the shock; the canoe sank, but the savages,\r\nthrowing themselves into the water, continued while swimming to shoot\r\ntheir arrows with the same rapidity. Climbing upon a rock level with\r\nthe water, they still fought with great bravery, though they were\r\nfinally captured, after one had been killed and the son of the queen\r\nhad received two wounds. When they were brought on board the Admiral's\r\nship, they no more changed their ferocious and savage mood than do the\r\nlions of Africa, when they find themselves caught in nets. There was\r\nno one who saw them who did not shiver with horror, so infernal and\r\nrepugnant was the aspect nature and their own cruel character had\r\ngiven them. I affirm this after what I have myself seen, and so\r\nlikewise do all those who went with me in Madrid to examine them.\r\n\r\nI return to my narrative. Each day the Spaniards advanced farther.\r\nThey had covered a distance of five hundred miles. Driven first by the\r\nsouth wind, then by the west wind, and finally by the wind from the\r\nnorth-west, they found themselves in a sea dotted with innumerable\r\nislands, strangely different one from another; some were covered with\r\nforests and prairies and offered delightful shade, while others, which\r\nwere dry and sterile, had very lofty and rocky mountains. The rocks of\r\nthese latter were of various colours, some purple, some violet, and\r\nsome entirely white. It is thought they contain metals and precious\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nThe ships did not touch, as the weather was unfavourable, and also\r\nbecause navigation amongst these islands is dangerous. Postponing\r\nuntil another time the exploration of these islands which, because of\r\ntheir confused grouping could not be counted, the Spaniards continued\r\ntheir voyage. Some lighter ships of the fleet did, however, cruise\r\namongst them, reconnoitring forty-six of them, while the heavier\r\nships, fearing the reefs, kept to the high sea. This collection of\r\nislands is called an archipelago. Outside the archipelago and directly\r\nacross the course rises the island called by the natives Burichena,\r\nwhich Columbus placed under the patronage of San Juan.[7] A number of\r\nthe captives rescued from the hands of the cannibals declared they\r\nwere natives of that island, which they said was populous and well\r\ncultivated; they explained that it had excellent ports, was covered\r\nwith forests, and that its inhabitants hated the cannibals and were\r\nconstantly at war with them. The inhabitants possessed no boats by\r\nwhich they could reach the coasts of the cannibals from their island;\r\nbut whenever they were lucky in repulsing a cannibal invasion for\r\nthe purpose of plundering, they cut their prisoners into small bits,\r\nroasted, and greedily ate them; for in war there is alternative good\r\nand bad fortune.\r\n\r\n[Note 7: Porto Rico.]\r\n\r\nAll this was recounted through the native interpreters who had been\r\ntaken back to Spain on the first voyage. Not to lose time, the\r\nSpaniards passed by Burichena; nevertheless some sailors, who landed\r\non the extreme western point of the island to take a supply of fresh\r\nwater, found there a handsome house built in the fashion of the\r\ncountry, and surrounded by a dozen or more ordinary structures, all of\r\nwhich were abandoned by their owners. Whether the inhabitants betake\r\nthemselves at that period of the year to the mountains to escape the\r\nheat, and then return to the lowlands when the temperature is fresher,\r\nor whether they had fled out of fear of the cannibals, is not\r\nprecisely known. There is but one king for the whole of the island,\r\nand he is reverently obeyed. The south coast of this island, which the\r\nSpaniards followed, is two hundred miles long.\r\n\r\nDuring the night two women and a young man, who had been rescued from\r\nthe cannibals, sprang into the sea and swam to their native island.\r\nA few days later the Spaniards finally arrived at the much-desired\r\nHispaniola, which is five hundred leagues from the nearest of the\r\ncannibal islands. Cruel fate had decreed the death of all those\r\nSpaniards who had been left there.\r\n\r\nThere is a coast region of Hispaniola which the natives call Xarama,\r\nand it was from Xarama that Columbus had set sail on his first\r\nvoyage, when he was about to return to Spain, taking with him the ten\r\ninterpreters of whom I spoke above, of whom only three survived; the\r\nothers having succumbed to the change of climate, country, and food.\r\n\r\nHardly were the ships in sight of the coast of Xarama, which Columbus\r\ncalled Santa Reina,[8] than the Admiral ordered one of these\r\ninterpreters to be set at liberty, and two others managed to jump into\r\nthe sea and swim to the shore. As Columbus did not yet know the sad\r\nfate of the thirty-eight men whom he had left on the island the\r\npreceding year, he was not concerned at this flight. When the\r\nSpaniards were near to the coast a long canoe with several rowers came\r\nout to meet them. In it was the brother of Guaccanarillo, that king\r\nwith whom the Admiral had signed a treaty when he left Hispaniola,\r\nand to whose care he had urgently commended the sailors he had left\r\nbehind. The brother brought to the Admiral, in the king's name, a\r\npresent of two golden statues; he also spoke in his own language--as\r\nwas later understood,--of the death of our compatriots; but as there\r\nwas no interpreter, nobody at the time understood his words.\r\n\r\n[Note 8: Xarama is also spelled in the Latin editions _Xamana_, and\r\nSanta Reina, _Sancteremus_.]\r\n\r\nUpon arriving, however, at the blockhouse and the houses, which were\r\nsurrounded by an entrenchment, they were all found reduced to ashes,\r\nwhile over the place a profound silence reigned. The Admiral and his\r\ncompanions were deeply moved by this discovery. Thinking and hoping\r\nthat some of the men might still be alive, he ordered cannon and guns\r\nto be fired, that the noise of these formidable detonations echoing\r\namongst the mountains and along the coasts might serve as a signal of\r\nhis arrival to any of our men who might be hidden among the islanders\r\nor among wild beasts. It was in vain; for they were all dead.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral afterwards sent messengers to Guaccanarillo, who, as far\r\nas they could understand, related as follows: there are on the island,\r\nwhich is very large, a number of kings, who are more powerful than he;\r\ntwo of these, disturbed by the news of the arrival of the Spaniards,\r\nassembled considerable forces, attacked and killed our men and burned\r\ntheir entrenchments, houses, and possessions; Guaccanarillo had\r\nstriven to save our men, and in the struggle had been wounded with an\r\narrow, his leg being still bandaged with cotton; and for this reason\r\nhe had not, despite his keen desire, been able to go to meet the\r\nAdmiral.\r\n\r\nThere do exist several sovereigns on the island, some more powerful\r\nthan the others; just as we read that the fabulous Æneas found Latium\r\ndivided amongst several kings, Latinus, Mezentius, Turnus, and\r\nTarchon, all near neighbours who fought over the territory. The\r\nislanders of Hispaniola, in my opinion, may be esteemed more fortunate\r\nthan were the Latins, above all should they become converted to the\r\ntrue religion. They go naked, they know neither weights nor measures,\r\nnor that source of all misfortunes, money; living in a golden age,\r\nwithout laws, without lying judges, without books, satisfied with\r\ntheir life, and in no wise solicitous for the future. Nevertheless\r\nambition and the desire to rule trouble even them, and they fight\r\namongst themselves, so that even in the golden age there is never a\r\nmoment without war; the maxim _Cede, non cedam_, has always prevailed\r\namongst mortal men.\r\n\r\nThe following day the Admiral sent to Guaccanarillo a Sevillan called\r\nMelchior, who had once been sent by the King and the Queen to the\r\nsovereign Pontiff when they captured Malaga. Melchior found him\r\nin bed, feigning illness, and surrounded by the beds of his seven\r\nconcubines. Upon removing the bandage [from his leg] Melchior\r\ndiscovered no trace of any wound, and this caused him to suspect that\r\nGuaccanarillo was the murderer of our compatriots. He concealed his\r\nsuspicions, however, and obtained the king's assurance that he would\r\ncome the following day to see the Admiral on board his ship, which he\r\ndid. As soon as he came on board, and after saluting the Spaniards and\r\ndistributing some gold among the officers, he turned to the women whom\r\nwe had rescued from the cannibals and, glancing with half-opened eyes\r\nat one of them whom we called Catherine, he spoke to her very softly;\r\nafter which, with the Admiral's permission, which he asked with great\r\npoliteness and urbanity, he inspected the horses and other things he\r\nhad never before seen, and then left.\r\n\r\nSome persons advised Columbus to hold Guaccanarillo prisoner, to\r\nmake him expiate in case it was proven that our compatriots had been\r\nassassinated by his orders; but the Admiral, deeming it inopportune to\r\nirritate the islanders, allowed him to depart.\r\n\r\nThe day after the morrow, the brother of the king, acting in his own\r\nname or in that of Guaccanarillo, came on board and won over the\r\nwomen, for the following night Catherine, in order to recover her own\r\nliberty and that of all her companions, yielded to the solicitation of\r\nGuaccanarillo or his brother, and accomplished a feat more heroic than\r\nthat of the Roman Clelia, when she liberated the other virgins who had\r\nserved with her as hostages, swam the Tiber and thus escaped from the\r\npower of Lars Porsena. Clelia crossed the river on a horse, while\r\nCatherine and several other women trusted only to their arms and swam\r\nfor a distance of three miles in a sea by no means calm; for that,\r\naccording to every one's opinion, was the distance between the ships\r\nand the coast. The sailors pursued them in light boats, guided by the\r\nsame light from the shore which served for the women, of whom they\r\ncaptured three. It is believed that Catherine and four others escaped\r\nto Guaccanarillo, for at daybreak, men sent out by the Admiral\r\nannounced that he and the women had fled together, taking all their\r\ngoods with them; and this fact confirmed the suspicion that he had\r\nconsented to the assassination of our men.\r\n\r\nMelchior, whom I have mentioned, was then despatched with three\r\nhundred men to search for him. In the course of his march he came upon\r\na winding gorge, overlooked by five lofty hills in such wise as to\r\nsuggest the estuary of a large river. There was found a large harbour,\r\nsafe and spacious, which they named Port Royal. The entrance of this\r\nharbour is crescent-shaped, and is so regularly formed that it is\r\ndifficult to detect whether ships have entered from the right or the\r\nleft; this can only be ascertained when they return to the entrance.\r\nThree large ships can enter abreast. The surrounding hills form the\r\ncoasts, and afford shelter from the winds. In the middle of the\r\nharbour there rises a promontory covered with forests, which are full\r\nof parrots and many other birds which there build their nests and fill\r\nthe air with sweet melodies. Two considerable rivers empty into this\r\nharbour.\r\n\r\nIn the course of their explorations of this country the Spaniards\r\nperceived in the distance a large house, which they approached,\r\npersuaded that it was the retreat of Guaccanarillo. They were met by a\r\nman with a wrinkled forehead and frowning brows, who was escorted by\r\nabout a hundred warriors armed with bows and arrows, pointed lances\r\nand clubs. He advanced menacingly towards them. \"_Tainos_,\" the\r\nnatives cried, that is to say, good men and not cannibals. In response\r\nto our amicable signs, they dropped their arms and modified their\r\nferocious attitude. To each one was presented a hawk's bell, and they\r\nbecame so friendly that they fearlessly went on board the ships,\r\nsliding down the steep banks of the river, and overwhelmed our\r\ncompatriots with gifts. Upon measuring the large house which was of\r\nspherical form, it was found to have a diameter of thirty-five long\r\npaces; surrounding it were thirty other ordinary houses. The ceilings\r\nwere decked with branches of various colours most artfully plaited\r\ntogether. In reply to our inquiries about Guaccanarillo, the natives\r\nresponded,--as far as could be understood,--that they were not\r\nsubjects of his, but of a chief who was there present; they likewise\r\ndeclared they understood that Guaccanarillo had left the coast to take\r\nrefuge in the mountains. After concluding a treaty of friendship with\r\nthat cacique, such being the name given to their kings, the Spaniards\r\nreturned to report what they had learned to the Admiral.\r\n\r\nColumbus had meanwhile sent some officers with an escort of men to\r\neffect a reconnaissance farther in the interior; two of the most\r\nconspicuous of these were Hojeda and Corvalano, both young and\r\ncourageous noblemen. One of them discovered three rivers, the other\r\nfour, all of which had their sources in these same mountains. In the\r\nsands of these rivers gold was found, which the Indians, who acted as\r\ntheir escort, proceeded in their presence to collect in the following\r\nmanner: they dug a hole in the sand about the depth of an arm, merely\r\nscooping the sand out of this trough with the right and left hands.\r\nThey extracted the grains of gold, which they afterwards presented to\r\nthe Spaniards. Some declared they saw grains as big as peas. I have\r\nseen with my own eyes a shapeless ingot similar to a round river\r\nstone, which was found by Hojeda, and was afterwards brought to Spain;\r\nit weighed nine ounces. Satisfied with this first examination they\r\nreturned to report to the Admiral.\r\n\r\nColumbus, as I have been told, had forbidden them to do more than\r\nexamine and reconnoitre the country. The news spread that the king\r\nof the mountain country, where all these rivers rise, was called the\r\nCacique Caunaboa, that is to say, the Lord of the Golden House; for in\r\ntheir language _boa_ is the word for a house, _cauna_ for gold, and\r\n_cacique_ for king, as I have above written. Nowhere are better\r\nfresh-water fish to be found, nor more beautiful nor better in taste,\r\nand less dangerous. The waters of all these rivers are likewise very\r\nwholesome.\r\n\r\nMelchior has told me that amongst the cannibals the days of the month\r\nof December are equal to the nights, but knowledge contradicts this\r\nobservation. I well know that in this self-same month of December,\r\nsome birds made their nests and others already hatched out their\r\nlittle ones; the heat was also considerable. When I inquired\r\nparticularly concerning the elevation of the north star above the\r\nhorizon, he answered me that in the land of the cannibals the Great\r\nBear entirely disappeared beneath the arctic pole. There is nobody who\r\ncame back from this second voyage whose testimony one may more safely\r\naccept than his; but had he possessed knowledge of astronomy he would\r\nhave limited himself to saying that the day is about as long as the\r\nnight. For in no place in the world does the night during the solstice\r\nprecisely equal the day; and it is certain that on this voyage the\r\nSpaniards never reached the equator, for they constantly beheld on the\r\nhorizon the polar star, which served them as guide. As for Melchior's\r\ncompanions, they were without knowledge or experience, therefore I\r\noffer you few particulars, and those only casually, as I have been\r\nable to collect them. I hope to narrate to you what I may be able to\r\nlearn from others. Moreover Columbus, whose particular friend I am,\r\nhas written me that he would recount me fully all that he has been\r\nfortunate enough to discover.[9]\r\n\r\n[Note 9: The letter of Columbus here mentioned is not known to exist.]\r\n\r\nThe Admiral selected an elevation near the port as the site for a\r\ntown[10]; and, within a few days, some houses and a church were built,\r\nas well as could be done in so short a time. And there, on the feast\r\nof the Three Kings (for when treating of this country one must speak\r\nof a new world, so distant is it and so devoid of civilisation and\r\nreligion) the Holy Sacrifice was celebrated by thirteen priests.[11]\r\n\r\n[Note 10: The first Spanish settlement was named Isabella, as was\r\nlikewise the cape on which it stood. Long after it was abandoned and\r\nhad fallen into ruin, the site was reputed to be haunted. See Las\r\nCasas, _Historia de las Indias_, vol. i., p. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Note 11: There were certainly not as many as thirteen priests\r\nwith Columbus. The text reads ...._divina nostro ritu sacra sunt\r\ndecantata tredecim sacerdotibus ministrantibus_. The number doubtless\r\nincludes all laymen who took any part, as acolytes, etc., in the\r\nceremonies.]\r\n\r\nAs the time when he had promised to send news to the King and Queen\r\napproached, and as the season was moreover favourable [for sailing],\r\nColumbus decided not to prolong his stay. He therefore ordered the\r\ntwelve caravels, whose arrival we have announced, to sail, though he\r\nwas much afflicted by the assassination of his comrades; because, but\r\nfor their death, we should possess much fuller information concerning\r\nthe climate and the products of Hispaniola.\r\n\r\nThat you may inform your apothecaries, druggists, and perfumers\r\nconcerning the products of this country and its high temperature, I\r\nsend you some seeds of all kinds, as well as the bark and the pith of\r\nthose trees which are believed to be cinnamon trees. If you wish to\r\ntaste either the seeds or the pith or the bark, be careful, Most\r\nIllustrious Prince, only to do so with caution; not that they are\r\nharmful, but they are very peppery, and if you leave them a long time\r\nin your mouth, they will sting the tongue. In case you should burn\r\nyour tongue a little in tasting them, take some water, and the burning\r\nsensation will be allayed. My messenger will also deliver to Your\r\nEminence some of those black and white seeds out of which they make\r\nbread. If you cut bits of the wood called aloes, which he brings, you\r\nwill scent the delicate perfumes it exhales.\r\n\r\nFare you well.\r\n\r\nFrom the Court of Spain, the third day of the calends of May, 1494.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\nTO CARDINAL LUDOVICO D'ARAGON\r\n\r\n\r\nYou desire that another skilful Phaeton should drive the car of the\r\nSun.

A new world, if\r\nI may so express myself, has been discovered under the auspices of the\r\nCatholic sovereigns, your uncle Ferdinand and your aunt Isabella, and\r\nyou command me to describe to you this heretofore unknown world; and\r\nto that effect you sent me a letter of your uncle, the illustrious\r\nKing Frederick.[1] You will both receive this precious stone, badly\r\nmounted and set in lead. But when you later observe that my beautiful\r\nnereids of the ocean are exposed to the furious attacks of erudite\r\nfriends and to the calumnies of detractors, you must frankly confess\r\nto them that you have forced me to send you this news, despite my\r\npressing occupations and my health. You are not ignorant that I have\r\ntaken these accounts from the first reports of the Admiral as rapidly\r\nas your secretary could write under my dictation. You hasten me by\r\ndaily announcing your departure for Naples in company of the Queen,\r\nsister of our King and your paternal aunt, whom you had accompanied\r\nto Spain. Thus you have forced me to complete my writings. You will\r\nobserve that the first two chapters are dedicated to another, for I\r\nhad really begun to write them with a dedication to your unfortunate\r\nrelative Ascanio Sforza, Cardinal and Vice-chancellor. When he fell\r\ninto disgrace,[2] I felt my interest in writing also decline. It is\r\nowing to you and to the letters sent me by your illustrious uncle,\r\nKing Frederick, that my ardour has revived.

He died in\r\n1504.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Upon the death of Innocent VIII., four members of the\r\nSacred College were conspicuous _papabili_: Raffæle Riario and\r\nGiuliano della Rovere, nephews of Sixtus IV., and Roderigo Borgia and\r\nAscanio Sforza. Borgia was elected and took the title of Alexander VI.\r\nHe rewarded Cardinal Sforza for his timely assistance in securing\r\nhis elevation, by giving him the Vice-Chancellorship he had himself\r\noccupied as Cardinal, the town of Nepi and the Borgia Palace in Rome.\r\nDissensions between Alexander and the Sforza family soon became acute;\r\nGiovanni Sforza, Lord of Pesaro and sometime husband of Lucrezia\r\nBorgia, was expelled, and his brother, Cardinal Ascanio was included\r\nin the papal disfavour. He sought refuge in Lombardy, where he was\r\ntaken prisoner by Louis XII., of France. Peter Martyr had foreseen,\r\nin a measure, the turbulent events of Alexander's pontificate; the\r\nSpanish sovereigns charged him to express to Cardinal Sforza their\r\ndisapproval of his action in supporting the Borgia party, that\r\nCardinal, though a Spaniard, being _persona non grata_ to them; and in\r\nso doing he wrote to his friend the dubious augury, \"God grant he may\r\nbe grateful to you.\" Ep. 119.]\r\n\r\nI have narrated in a preceding book how the Admiral Columbus, after\r\nhaving visited the cannibal islands, landed at Hispaniola on the\r\nfourth day of the nones of February, 1493, without having lost a\r\nsingle vessel. I shall now recount what he discovered while exploring\r\nthat island and another neighbouring one, which he believed to be a\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nAccording to Columbus, Hispaniola is the island of Ophir mentioned in\r\nthe third book of Kings.[3] Its width covers five degrees of south\r\nlatitude, for its north coast extends to the twenty-seventh degree and\r\nthe south coast to the twenty-second; its length extends 780 miles,\r\nthough some of the companions of Columbus give greater dimensions.[4]\r\nSome declare that it extends to within forty-nine degrees of Cadiz,\r\nand others to an even greater distance. The calculation concerning\r\nthis has not been made with precision.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: Ortelius, in his _Geographia Sacra_, gives the name of\r\nOphir to Hayti; and it was a commonly held opinion that Solomon's\r\nmines of Ophir were situated in America. Columbus shared this belief,\r\nand he later wrote of Veragua, when he discovered the coasts of\r\nDarien, that he was positive the gold mines there were those of\r\nOphir.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Hayti is 600 kilometres long from east to west, and 230\r\nbroad, from north to south, with a superficial area of 74,000 square\r\nkilometres.]\r\n\r\nThe island is shaped like a chestnut leaf. Columbus decided to found\r\na town[5] upon an elevated hill on the northern coast, since in\r\nthat vicinity there was a mountain with stone-quarries for building\r\npurposes and chalk to make lime. At the foot of this mountain a vast\r\nplain[6] extends for a distance of sixty miles in length, and of\r\nan average of twelve leagues in breadth, varying from six in the\r\nnarrowest part to twenty in the broadest. This plain is fertilised by\r\nseveral rivers of wholesome water, of which the largest is navigable\r\nand empties into a bay situated half a stadium from the town. As the\r\nnarrative proceeds you will learn how fruitful this valley is, and how\r\nfertile is its soil. The Spaniards laid out parcels of land on the\r\nriver bank, which they intended to make into gardens, and where they\r\nplanted all kinds of vegetables, roots, lettuces, cabbages, salads,\r\nand other things. Sixteen days after the sowing, the plants had\r\neverywhere grown; melons, pumpkins, cucumbers, and other similar\r\nproducts were ripe for picking thirty-six days after they were\r\nplanted, and nowhere had our people tasted any of finer flavour.\r\nThroughout the whole year one might thus have fresh vegetables.\r\nCane-roots, from the juice of which sugar is extracted (but not\r\ncrystallised sugar) grew to a height of a cubit within fifteen days\r\nafter planting, and the same happened to graftings of vines. Excellent\r\ngrapes may be eaten from these vines the second year after planting,\r\nbut on account of their exaggerated size, the bunches were not\r\nnumerous. A certain peasant planted a foot of wheat about the calends\r\nof February, and wonderful to say, in the sight of everybody he\r\nbrought into the town a bunch of ripe grain on the third day of the\r\ncalends of April, which fell in that year on the eve of Easter. Two\r\nharvests of vegetables may be counted upon within the year. I have\r\nrepeated what is told to me about the fertility of the country by\r\nall those, without exception, who have returned from there. I would\r\nnotice, however, that according to some observations wheat does not\r\ngrow equally well throughout the whole country.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: The town of Santo Domingo, standing at the mouth of the\r\nOzama river.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6: This valley is the actual Vega Real.]\r\n\r\nDuring this time the Admiral despatched some thirty of his men in\r\ndifferent directions to explore the district of Cipangu, which is\r\nstill called Cibao. This is a mountainous region covered with rocks\r\nand occupying the centre of the island, where, the natives explained\r\nby signs, gold is obtained in abundance. The Admiral's explorers\r\nbrought back marvellous reports of the riches of the country. Four\r\nlarge rivers rise in these mountains, into which other streams flow,\r\nthus dividing the island by an extraordinary natural arrangement into\r\nfour almost equal parts. The first, which the natives call Junua, lies\r\ntowards the east; the second, which borders on it and extends to the\r\nwest, is called Attibinico; the third lies to the north and is called\r\nIachi, while the fourth, Naiba, lies to the south.\r\n\r\nBut let us consider how the town was founded. After having surrounded\r\nthe site with ditches and entrenchments for defence against possible\r\nattacks by the natives on the garrison he left there, during his\r\nabsence, the Admiral started on the eve of the ides of March\r\naccompanied by all the gentlemen and about four hundred foot-soldiers\r\nfor the southern region where the gold was found. Crossing a river,\r\nhe traversed the plain and climbed the mountain beyond it. He reached\r\nanother valley watered by a river even larger than the former one, and\r\nby others of less importance. Accompanied by his force he crossed this\r\nvalley, which was in no place more elevated than the first one, and\r\nthus he reached the third mountain which had never been ascended. He\r\nmade the ascent and came down on the other side into a valley where\r\nthe province of Cibao begins. This valley is watered by rivers and\r\nstreams which flow down from the hills, and gold is also found in\r\ntheir sands. After penetrating into the interior of the gold region a\r\ndistance of some seventy-two miles from the town, Columbus resolved to\r\nestablish a fortified post on an eminence commanding the river banks,\r\nfrom which he might study more closely the mysteries of this region.\r\nHe named this place San Tomas.\r\n\r\nWhile he was occupied in building this fortification he was delayed by\r\nthe natives, who came to visit him in the hope of getting some bells\r\nor other trifles. Columbus gave them to understand that he was very\r\nwilling to give them what they asked, if they would bring him gold.\r\nUpon hearing this promise the natives turned their backs and ran to\r\nthe neighbouring river, returning soon afterwards with hands full of\r\ngold. One old man only asked a little bell in return for two grains of\r\ngold weighing an ounce. Seeing that the Spaniards admired the size of\r\nthese grains, and quite amazed at their astonishment, he explained to\r\nthem by signs that they were of no value; after which, taking in his\r\nhands four stones, of which the smallest was the size of a nut and the\r\nlargest as big as an orange, he told them that in his country, which\r\nwas half a day's journey distant, one found here and there ingots of\r\ngold quite as large. He added that his neighbours did not even take\r\nthe trouble to pick them up. It is now known that the islanders set no\r\nvalue on gold as such; they only prize it when it has been worked by\r\na craftsman into some form which pleases them. Who amongst us pays\r\nattention to rough marble or to unworked ebony? Certainly nobody;\r\nbut if this marble is transformed by the hand of a Phidias or a\r\nPraxiteles, and if it then presents to our eyes the form of a Nereid\r\nwith flowing hair, or a hamadryad with graceful body, buyers will not\r\nbe wanting. Besides this old man, a number of natives brought ingots,\r\nweighing ten or twelve drachmas,[7] and they had the effrontery to\r\nsay that in the region where they had found them, they sometimes\r\ndiscovered ingots as big as the head of a child whom they indicated.\r\n\r\n[Note 7: The Greek drachma weighed one eighth of an ounce.]\r\n\r\nDuring the days he passed at San Tomas, the Admiral sent a young\r\nnobleman named Luxan, accompanied by an escort, to explore another\r\nregion. Luxan told even more extraordinary things, which he had heard\r\nfrom the natives, but he brought back nothing; it is probable that he\r\ndid this in obedience to the Admiral's orders. Spices, but not those\r\nwe use, abound in their forests, and these they gather just as they do\r\ngold; that is to say, whenever they wish to trade with the inhabitants\r\nof the neighbouring islands for something which pleases them; for\r\nexample, long plates, seats, or other articles manufactured out of a\r\nblack wood which does not grow in Hispaniola. On his return journey,\r\ntowards the ides of March, Luxan found wild grapes of excellent\r\nflavour, already ripe in the forest, but the islanders take no account\r\nof them. The country, although very stony (for the word Cibao means\r\nin their language _rocky_) is nevertheless covered with trees and\r\ngrasses. It is even said that the growth on the mountains, which\r\nstrictly speaking is only grass, grows taller than wheat within four\r\ndays after it has been mown. The rains being frequent, the rivers and\r\nstreams are full of water, and as gold is everywhere found mixed with\r\nthe sand of the river-beds, it is conjectured that this metal is\r\nwashed down from the mountains by the streams. It is certain that the\r\nnatives are extremely lazy, for they shiver with cold among their\r\nmountains in winter, without ever thinking of making clothes for\r\nthemselves, although cotton is found in abundance. In the valleys and\r\nlowlands they have nothing to fear from cold.\r\n\r\nHaving carefully examined the region of Cibao, Columbus returned on\r\nthe calends of April, the day after Easter, to Isabella; this being\r\nthe name he had given to the new city. Confiding the government\r\nof Isabella and the entire island to his brother[8] and one Pedro\r\nMargarita, an old royal courtier, Columbus made preparations for\r\nexploring the island which lies only seventy miles from Hispaniola,\r\nand which he believed to be a continent. He had not forgotten the\r\nroyal instructions, which urged him to visit the new coasts, without\r\ndelay, lest some other sovereign might take possession of them. For\r\nthe King of Portugal made no secret of his intention also to discover\r\nunknown islands. True it is that the Sovereign Pontiff, Alexander VI.,\r\nhad sent to the King and Queen of Spain his bull, sealed with lead, by\r\nwhich it was forbidden to any other sovereign to visit those unknown\r\nregions.[9] To avoid all conflict, a straight line from north to south\r\nhad been drawn, first at one hundred leagues and afterwards by common\r\naccord at three hundred leagues west of the parallel of the isles of\r\nCape Verde. We believe these islands to be those formerly called\r\nthe Hesperides. They belong to the King of Portugal. The Portuguese\r\nmariners have continued their explorations to the east of that line;\r\nfollowing the coast of Africa on their left, they directed their\r\ncourse to the east, crossing the Ethiopian seas, and up to the present\r\ntime none of them has yet sailed to the west of the Hesperides, or\r\ntowards the south.\r\n\r\n[Note 8: According to the judgment of Las Casas, Bartholomew\r\nColumbus was a man of superior character and well qualified to rule,\r\nhad he not been eclipsed by his famous brother. _Hist. Ind_., ii., p.\r\n8.]\r\n\r\n[Note 9: Bull granted May 4, 1493: _Ac quibuscumque personis . . .\r\ndistrictius inhibemus, ne ad insulas et terras firmas inventas, et\r\ninveniendas detectas et detegendas, versus occidentem et meridiem,\r\nfabricando et construendo lineam a Polo Arctico ad Polum antarcticum,\r\nsive terræ firmæ, Insulæ inventæ et inveniendae sint versus aliam\r\nquamcumque partem quæ linea distet a qualibet insularum quæ vulgariter\r\nappellantur de los Azores el Capo Verde, centum leucis versus\r\noccidentem et meridiem ut præfertur pro mercibus habendis, vel\r\nquavis alia de causa accedere præsumant, absque vestra et hæredum\r\net subcesorum vestrorum prædictorum licentia spetiali_.... By the\r\nagreement signed at Tordesillas, the distance was increased by common\r\nconsent between Spain and Portugal, not as Martyr says, to 300, but to\r\n370 leagues.]\r\n\r\nLeaving Hispaniola,[10] the Admiral sailed with three vessels in the\r\ndirection of the land he had taken for an island on his first voyage,\r\nand had named Juana. He arrived, after a brief voyage, and named the\r\nfirst coast he touched Alpha and Omega, because he thought that there\r\nour East ended when the sun set in that island, and our West began\r\nwhen the sun rose. It is indeed proven that on the west side India\r\nbegins beyond the Ganges, and ends on the east side. It is not without\r\ncause that cosmographers have left the boundaries of Ganges India\r\nundetermined.[11] There are not wanting those among them who think\r\nthat the coasts of Spain do not lie very distant from the shores of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n[Note 10: He left Hispaniola on April 24th.]\r\n\r\n[Note 11: This was the general opinion of cosmographers and\r\nnavigators at that period; contemporary maps and globes show the\r\nAsiatic continent in the place actually occupied by Florida and\r\nMexico. See map of Ptolemeus de Ruysch, _Universalior coquiti orbis\r\ntabula ex recentibus confecta observationibus_, Rome, 1508.]\r\n\r\nThe natives called this country Cuba.[12] Within sight of it, the\r\nAdmiral discovered at the extremity of Hispaniola a very commodious\r\nharbour formed by a bend in the island. He called this harbour, which\r\nis barely twenty leagues distant from Cuba, San Nicholas.\r\n\r\n[Note 12: Always deeming Cuba to be an extension of Asia, Columbus\r\nwas anxious to complete his reconnaissance, and then to proceed to\r\nIndia and Cathay.]\r\n\r\nColumbus covered this distance, and desiring to skirt the south coast\r\nof Cuba, he laid his course to the west; the farther he advanced the\r\nmore extensive did the coast become, but bending towards the south, he\r\nfirst discovered, to the left of Cuba, an island called by the natives\r\nJamaica,[13] of which he reports that it is longer and broader\r\nthan Sicily. It is composed of one sole mountain, which rises in\r\nimperceptible gradations from the coasts to the centre, sloping so\r\ngently that in mounting it, the ascent is scarcely noticeable. Both\r\nthe coast country and the interior of Jamaica are extremely fertile\r\nand populous. According to the report of their neighbours, the\r\nnatives of this island have a keener intelligence and are cleverer in\r\nmechanical arts, as well as more warlike than others. And indeed, each\r\ntime the Admiral sought to land in any place, they assembled in armed\r\nbands, threatening him, and not hesitating to offer battle. As they\r\nwere always conquered, they ended by making peace with him. Leaving\r\nJamaica to one side, the Admiral sailed to the west for seventy days\r\nwith favourable winds. He expected to arrive in the part of the world\r\nunderneath us just near the Golden Chersonese, which is situated to\r\nthe east of Persia. He thought, as a matter of fact, that of the\r\ntwelve hours of the sun's course of which we are ignorant he would\r\nhave only lost two.\r\n\r\n[Note 13: The island is about eighty-five miles from Cuba. The\r\nname Jamaica, which has survived, meant in the native tongue \"land of\r\nwood and water.\" It was really discovered on May 13th, but was not\r\ncolonised until 1509.]\r\n\r\nIt is known that the ancients have only followed the sun during the\r\nhalf of its course, since they only knew that part of the globe which\r\nlies between Cadiz and the Ganges, or even to the Golden Chersonese.\r\n\r\nDuring this voyage, the Admiral encountered marine currents as\r\nimpetuous as torrents, with great waves and undercurrents, to say\r\nnothing of the dangers presented by the immense number of neighbouring\r\nislands; but he was heedless of these perils, and was determined to\r\nadvance until he had ascertained whether Cuba was an island or a\r\ncontinent. He continued, therefore, coasting the shores of the island,\r\nand always towards the west, to a distance, according to his report,\r\nof two hundred and twenty-two leagues, which is equal to about one\r\nthousand three hundred miles. He gave names to seven thousand islands,\r\nand moreover beheld on his left hand more than three thousand others\r\nrising from the waves. But let us return to those matters worthy to be\r\nremembered which he encountered during this voyage.\r\n\r\nWhile the Admiral was carefully examining the character of these\r\nplaces, coasting along the shore of Cuba, he first discovered, not far\r\nfrom Alpha (that is from the end of it), a harbour sufficient for many\r\nships. Its entrance is in the form of a scythe, shut in on the two\r\nsides by promontories that break the waves; and it is large and of\r\ngreat depth. Following the coast of this harbour, he perceived at a\r\nshort distance from the shore two huts, and several fires burning here\r\nand there. A landing was made, but no people were found; nevertheless\r\nthere were wooden spits arranged about the fire, on which hung fish,\r\naltogether of about a hundred pounds' weight, and alongside lay two\r\nserpents eight feet long.[14] The Spaniards were astonished, and\r\nlooked about for some one with whom to speak, but saw nobody. Indeed,\r\nthe owners of the fish had fled to the mountains on seeing them\r\napproach. The Spaniards rested there to eat, and were pleased to find\r\nthe fish, which had cost them nothing, much to their taste; but they\r\ndid not touch the serpents. They report that these latter were in no\r\nwise different from the crocodiles of the Nile, except in point of\r\nsize. According to Pliny, crocodiles as long as eighteen cubits have\r\nbeen found; while the largest in Cuba do not exceed eight feet. When\r\ntheir hunger was satisfied, they penetrated into the neighbouring\r\nwoods, where they found a number of these serpents tied to the trees\r\nwith cords; some were attached by their heads, others had had their\r\nteeth pulled out. While the Spaniards busied themselves in visiting\r\nthe neighbourhood of the harbour, they discovered about seventy\r\nnatives who had fled at their approach, and who now sought to know\r\nwhat these unknown people wanted. Our men endeavoured to attract them\r\nby gestures and signs, and gentle words, and one of them, fascinated\r\nby the gifts which they exhibited from a distance, approached, but no\r\nnearer than a neighbouring rock. It was clear that he was afraid.\r\n\r\n[Note 14: As will be later seen, these so-called serpents are\r\niguanas. They are still a common article of food throughout the\r\nislands, and _tierra caliente_ of Mexico and Central America, and make\r\nsavoury dishes.]\r\n\r\nDuring his first voyage the Admiral had taken a native of Guanahani\r\n(an island near by Cuba), whom he had named Diego Columbus, and had\r\nbrought up with his own children. Diego served him as interpreter, and\r\nas his maternal tongue was akin to the language of the islander who\r\nhad approached, he spoke to him. Overcoming his fears, the islander\r\ncame amongst the Spaniards, and persuaded his companions to join him\r\nas there was nothing to fear. About seventy natives then descended\r\nfrom their rocks and made friends, and the Admiral offered them\r\npresents.\r\n\r\nThey were fishermen, sent to fish by their cacique, who was preparing\r\na festival for the reception of another chief. They were not at\r\nall vexed when they found that their fish had been eaten and their\r\nserpents left, for they considered these serpents the most delicate\r\nfood. Common people among them eat less often of the serpents than\r\nthey would with us of pheasants or peacocks. Moreover they could catch\r\nas many fish as the Spaniards had eaten, in one hour. When asked why\r\nthey cooked the fish they were to carry to their cacique, they replied\r\nthat they did so to preserve it from corruption. After swearing a\r\nmutual friendship they separated.\r\n\r\nFrom that point of the Cuban coast which he had named Alpha, as we\r\nhave said, the Admiral sailed towards the west. The middle portions of\r\nthe shores of the bay were well wooded but steep and mountainous. Some\r\nof the trees were in flower, and the sweet perfumes they exhaled were\r\nwafted out across the sea,[15] while others were weighted with fruit.\r\nBeyond the bay the country was more fertile and more populous. The\r\nnatives were likewise more civilised and more desirous of novelties,\r\nfor, at the sight of the vessels, a crowd of them came down to the\r\nshore, offering our men the kind of bread they ate, and gourds full of\r\nwater. They begged them to come on land.\r\n\r\n[Note 15: The fragrant odours blown out to sea from the American\r\ncoasts are mentioned by several of the early explorers.]\r\n\r\nOn all these islands there is found a tree about the size of our elms,\r\nwhich bears a sort of gourd out of which they make drinking cups; but\r\nthey never eat it, as its pulp is bitterer than gall, and its shell is\r\nas hard as a turtle's back. On the ides of May the watchers saw from\r\nthe height of the lookout an incredible multitude of islands to the\r\nsouth-west; two of them were covered with grass and green trees, and\r\nall of them were inhabited.\r\n\r\nOn the shore of the continent there emptied a navigable river of which\r\nthe water was so hot that one could not leave one's hand long in it.\r\nThe next day, having seen a canoe of fishermen in the distance, and\r\nfearing that these fishermen might take to flight at sight of them,\r\nthe Admiral ordered a barque to cut off their retreat; but the men\r\nwaited for the Spaniards without sign of fear.\r\n\r\nListen now to this new method of fishing. Just as we use French dogs\r\nto chase hares across the plain, so do these fishermen catch fish\r\nby means of a fish trained for that purpose. This fish in no wise\r\nresembles any that we know. Its body is similar to that of a large\r\neel, and upon its head it has a large pouch made of a very tough skin.\r\nThey tie the fish to the side of the boat, with just the amount of\r\ncord necessary to hold it under the water; for it cannot stand contact\r\nwith the air. As soon as a large fish or turtle is seen (and these\r\nlatter are as large as a huge shield), they let the fish go. The\r\nmoment it is freed, it attacks, with the rapidity of an arrow, the\r\nfish or turtle, on some part exposed from the shell, covering it with\r\nthe pouch-like skin, and attaching itself with such tenacity that the\r\nonly way to pull it off alive is by rolling a cord round a pole and\r\nraising the fish out of the water, when contact with the air causes\r\nit to drop its prey. This is-done by some of the fishermen who throw\r\nthemselves into the water, and hold it above the surface, until their\r\ncompanions, who remained in the barque, have dragged it on board. This\r\ndone, the cord is loosened enough for the fisherman-fish to drop back\r\ninto the water, when it is fed with pieces of the prey which has been\r\ncaught.\r\n\r\nThe islanders call this fish _guaicano_, and our people call it\r\n_riverso_.[16] Four turtles which they caught in this fashion and\r\npresented to the Spaniards almost filled a native barque. They highly\r\nprize the flesh of turtles, and the Spaniards made them some presents\r\nin exchange which highly pleased them. When our sailors questioned\r\nthem concerning the size of the land, they answered that it had no\r\nend towards the west. They insisted that the Admiral should land, or\r\nshould send some one in his name to salute their cacique, promising\r\nmoreover that if the Spaniards would go to visit the cacique, the\r\nlatter would make them various presents; but the Admiral, not wishing\r\nto retard the execution of his project, refused to yield to their\r\nwishes. The islanders asked him his name, and told him the name of\r\ntheir cacique.\r\n\r\n[Note 16: A sea-lamprey, also called _remora_ and _echineis_.\r\nOviedo gives details concerning the manner of catching, raising,\r\nand training the young lampreys to serve as game-fish. _Hist. delle\r\nIndie_, cap. x., in Ramusio. The account is interesting and despite\r\nobvious inaccuracies may have a basis of truth.]\r\n\r\nContinuing his route towards the west, the Admiral arrived several\r\ndays later in the neighbourhood of a very lofty mountain, where,\r\nbecause of the fertility of the soil, there were many inhabitants. The\r\nnatives assembled in crowds, and brought bread, cotton, rabbits, and\r\nbirds on board the ships. They inquired with great curiosity of the\r\ninterpreter, if this new race of men was descended from heaven. Their\r\nking, and a number of wise men who accompanied him, made known\r\nby signs that this land was not an island. Landing on another\r\nneighbouring island, which almost touched Cuba, the Spaniards were\r\nunable to discover a single inhabitant; everybody, men and women, had\r\nfled on their approach. They found there four dogs which could not\r\nbark and were of hideous aspect. The people eat them just as we do\r\nkids. Geese, ducks, and herons abound in that island. Between these\r\nislands and the continent there were such strong currents that the\r\nAdmiral had great difficulty in tacking, and the water was so shallow\r\nthat the keels of the ships sometimes scraped the sand. For a space of\r\nforty miles the water of these currents was white, and so thick that\r\none would have sworn the sea was sprinkled with flour. Having finally\r\nregained the open, the Admiral discovered, eighty miles farther on,\r\nanother very lofty mountain. He landed to replenish his supply of\r\nwater and wood. In the midst of the thick palm and pine groves two\r\nsprings of sweet water were found. While the men were busy cutting\r\nwood and filling their barrels, one of our archers went off in the\r\nwoods to hunt. He there suddenly encountered a native, so well dressed\r\nin a white tunic, that at the first glance he believed he saw before\r\nhim one of the Friars of Santa Maria de la Merced, whom the Admiral\r\nhad brought with him. This native was soon followed by two others,\r\nlikewise coming out of the forest, and then by a troop of about thirty\r\nmen, all of them clothed. Our archer turned and ran shouting, as\r\nquickly as he could, towards the ships. These people dressed in tunics\r\nshouted after him, and tried by all means of persuasion in their power\r\nto calm his fears. But he did not stop in his flight. Upon hearing\r\nthis news, the Admiral, delighted finally to discover a civilised\r\nnation, at once landed a troop of armed men, ordering them to advance,\r\nif necessary, as far as forty miles into the country, until they\r\nshould find those people dressed in tunics, or at least some other\r\ninhabitants.[17] The Spaniards marched through the forest and emerged\r\non an extensive plain overgrown with brush, amidst which there was\r\nno vestige of a path. They sought to cut a pathway through the\r\nundergrowth, but wandered about so hopelessly that they hardly\r\nadvanced a mile. This underbrush was indeed as high as our grain when\r\nripe. Worn out and fatigued, they returned without having discovered\r\na trail. The next day the Admiral sent out a new troop of twenty-five\r\nmen, urging them to use the greatest diligence to discover the\r\ninhabitants of that country. They, however, having come upon the\r\ntracks of some large animals, amongst which they thought they\r\nrecognised those of lions, were terrified and retraced their\r\nsteps.[18] In the course of their march, they had found a forest\r\novergrown with wild vines, which hung suspended from the loftiest\r\ntrees, and also many other spice-producing trees. They brought back to\r\nSpain heavy and juicy bunches of grapes. As for the other fruits they\r\ncollected, it was impossible to bring them to Spain, because there\r\nwere no means of preserving them on board the ships; hence they\r\nrotted, and when they were spoiled they threw them into the sea. The\r\nmen said that they had seen flocks of cranes twice as large as ours in\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\n[Note 17: None of the natives of the islands wore white tunics,\r\nnor indeed any but the most scanty covering. It has been surmised that\r\nthe soldier who made this report may indistinctly and from a distance\r\nhave descried a flock of tall white cranes, otherwise he was either\r\nthe victim of an hallucination or an inventor of strange tales to\r\nastonish his fellows. Humboldt (_Histoire de la Géographie du nouveau\r\nContinent_) quotes an instance of the colonists of Angostora once\r\nmistaking a flock of cranes for a band of soldiers.]\r\n\r\n[Note 18: There were no lions nor large beasts of prey in the\r\nisland; it has been suggested that these tracks may have been\r\nfootprints of an alligator.]\r\n\r\nPursuing his course, the Admiral sailed towards other mountains; he\r\nobserved upon the shore two huts, in which only one man was found,\r\nwho, when he was brought on board the ships, shook his head and hands,\r\nindicating by signs that the country about these mountains was very\r\npopulous. All along this coast the Admiral encountered numerous canoes\r\nwhich came to meet him, and on one side and the other friendly signals\r\nwere exchanged. The man Diego, who, from the beginning of the voyage\r\nunderstood the language of the islanders, did not understand that of\r\nthis newcomer. It was known, indeed, that the languages vary in the\r\ndifferent provinces of Cuba.[19] The natives gave it to be understood\r\nthat a powerful sovereign, who wore clothes, lived in the interior of\r\nthe country. The whole of the coast was inundated by waters, the beach\r\nbeing muddy and strewn with trees like in our swamps. When they landed\r\nto replenish their supply of water, they found some shells with pearls\r\nin them. Columbus nevertheless continued on his way, for he sought\r\nat that time, in obedience to the royal instructions, to explore the\r\ngreatest possible extent of sea. As they proceeded on their course,\r\nlighted fires were observed on all the hilltops of the coast country,\r\nas far as to another mountain eighty miles distant. There was not a\r\nsingle lookout upon the rocks from which smoke did not rise.\r\n\r\n[Note 19: Pezuela gives interesting information concerning the\r\ntribal languages of Cuba. _Diccionario Geografico, Estadistico,\r\nHistorico de la isla de Cuba_.]\r\n\r\nIt was doubtful whether these fires had been lighted by the natives\r\nfor domestic purposes or whether it was their custom in time of war\r\nthus to signal to warn their neighbours to provide for their safety\r\nand unite their forces to repel our attacks.\r\n\r\nWhat is more probable is that they assembled to inspect our ships, as\r\nthough they were something prodigious, concerning which they knew not\r\nwhat course to adopt. The coast-line began to recede in a southerly\r\ndirection, and the sea continued to be encumbered with islands. Some\r\nof the ships, which had been scraped by the reefs, had sprung; ropes,\r\nsails, and other tackle were rotted, and provisions were spoiled by\r\nthe humidity. The Admiral was, consequently, obliged to retrace his\r\ncourse.[20] The extreme point of this country reached by him, and\r\nwhich he believed to be a continent, he named Evangelista.\r\n\r\n[Note 20: Two or three days more would have sufficed to\r\ndemonstrate the insular character of Cuba, and would doubtless have\r\nmade Columbus the discoverer of Yucatan.]\r\n\r\nDuring the return voyage, Columbus passed among many other islands\r\nmore distant from the continent, and reached a sea where he found such\r\nnumbers of huge turtles that they obstructed the advance of his fleet.\r\nHe likewise crossed currents of whitish water, similar to those he had\r\nalready seen.[21] Fearing to sail amongst these islands he returned,\r\nand coasted along the one he believed to be a continent.\r\n\r\n[Note 21: The milky colour was produced by quantities of chalky\r\nsand, churned up from the bottom by the currents.]\r\n\r\nAs he had never maltreated the natives, the inhabitants, both men and\r\nwomen, gladly brought him gifts, displaying no fear. Their presents\r\nconsisted of parrots, bread, water, rabbits, and most of all, of doves\r\nmuch larger than ours, according to the Admiral's account. As he\r\nnoticed that these birds gave forth an aromatic odour when they were\r\neaten, he had the stomach of one of them opened, and found it filled\r\nwith flowers. Evidently that is what gave such a superior taste to\r\nthese doves; for it is credible that the flesh of animals assimilates\r\nthe qualities of their food.\r\n\r\nWhile assisting at Mass one day, Columbus beheld a man eighty years\r\nold, who seemed respectable though he wore no clothes, coming towards\r\nhim, accompanied by a number of his people. During the rest of the\r\nceremony this man looked on full of admiration; he was all eyes and\r\nears. Then he presented the Admiral with a basket he was carrying,\r\nwhich was filled with native fruits, and finally sitting beside him,\r\nmade the following speech which was interpreted by Diego Columbus,\r\nwho, being from a neighbouring country, understood his language:\r\n\r\n\"It is reported to us that you have visited all these countries, which\r\nwere formerly unknown to you, and have inspired the inhabitants with\r\ngreat fear. Now I tell and warn you, since you should know this, that\r\nthe soul, when it quits the body, follows one of two courses; the\r\nfirst is dark and dreadful, and is reserved for the enemies and the\r\ntyrants of the human race; joyous and delectable is the second, which\r\nis reserved for those who during their lives have promoted the peace\r\nand tranquillity of others. If, therefore, you are a mortal, and\r\nbelieve that each one will meet the fate he deserves, you will harm no\r\none.\"\r\n\r\nThanks to his native interpreter, the Admiral understood this speech\r\nand many others of the same tenor, and was astonished to discover such\r\nsound judgment in a man who went naked. He answered: \"I have knowledge\r\nof what you have said concerning the two courses and the two destinies\r\nof our souls when they leave our bodies; but I had thought until now\r\nthat these mysteries were unknown to you and to your countrymen,\r\nbecause you live in a state of nature.\" He then informed the old man\r\nthat he had been sent thither by the King and Queen of Spain to take\r\npossession of those countries hitherto unknown to the outside world,\r\nand that, moreover, he would make war upon the cannibals and all the\r\nnatives guilty of crimes, punishing them according to their deserts.\r\nAs for the innocent, he would protect and honour them because of their\r\nvirtues. Therefore, neither he nor any one whose intentions were pure\r\nneed be afraid; rather, if he or any other honourable man had been\r\ninjured in his interests by his neighbours he had only to say so.\r\n\r\nThese words of the Admiral afforded such pleasure to the old man that\r\nhe announced that, although weakened by age, he would gladly go with\r\nColumbus, and he would have done so if his wife and sons had not\r\nprevented him. What occasioned him great surprise was to learn that\r\na man like Columbus recognised the authority of a sovereign; but his\r\nastonishment still further increased when the interpreter explained\r\nto him how powerful were the kings and how wealthy, and all about the\r\nSpanish nation, the manner of fighting, and how great were the cities\r\nand how strong the fortresses. In great dejection the man, together\r\nwith his wife and sons, threw themselves at the feet of Columbus,\r\nwith their eyes full of tears, repeatedly asking if the country which\r\nproduced such men and in such numbers was not indeed heaven.\r\n\r\nIt is proven that amongst them the land belongs to everybody, just as\r\ndoes the sun or the water. They know no difference between _meum_ and\r\n_tuum_, that source of all evils. It requires so little to satisfy\r\nthem, that in that vast region there is always more land to cultivate\r\nthan is needed. It is indeed a golden age, neither ditches, nor\r\nhedges, nor walls to enclose their domains; they live in gardens open\r\nto all, without laws and without judges; their conduct is naturally\r\nequitable, and whoever injures his neighbour is considered a criminal\r\nand an outlaw. They cultivate maize, yucca, and ages, as we have\r\nalready related is the practice in Hispaniola.\r\n\r\nOn his return from Cuba to Hispaniola, the Admiral again came in sight\r\nof Jamaica, and this time he skirted its southern coast from west to\r\neast. Upon reaching the eastern extremity of this island, he beheld in\r\nthe north and on his left high mountains, which he believed to be the\r\nsouthern coast of Hispaniola which he had not before visited. On the\r\ncalends of September he reached the port he had named San Nicholas,\r\nand there repaired his ships, intending to again ravage the cannibal\r\nislands and burn the canoes of the natives. He was determined that\r\nthese rapacious wolves should no longer injure the sheep, their\r\nneighbours; but his project could not be realised because of his bad\r\nhealth. Long watches had weakened him; borne on shore half dead by the\r\nsailors of Port Isabella, and surrounded by his two brothers and his\r\nfriends, he finally recovered his former health, but he could not\r\nrenew his attack on the cannibal islands, because of the disturbances\r\nwhich had broken out amongst the Spaniards he had left in Hispaniola.\r\nConcerning these I shall later explain. Fare you well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\nTO CARDINAL LUDOVICO D'ARAGON, NEPHEW OF OUR KING\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Columbus returned from the land which he believed to be the\r\nIndian continent, he learned that the Friar Boyl[1] and Pedro\r\nMargarita,[2] the nobleman who formerly enjoyed the King's friendship,\r\nas well as several others to whom he had confided the government of\r\nHispaniola, had departed for Spain animated by evil intentions. In\r\norder that he might justify himself before the sovereigns, in case\r\nthey should have been prejudiced by the reports of his enemies, and\r\nalso for the purpose of recruiting colonists to replace those who had\r\nleft, and to replenish the failing foodstuffs, such as wheat, wine,\r\noil, and other provisions which form the ordinary food of Spaniards,\r\nwho do not easily accustom themselves to that of the natives, he\r\ndecided to betake himself to the Court, which at that time was\r\nresident at Burgos, a celebrated town of Old Castile. But I must\r\nrelate briefly what he did before his departure.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: The character of Padre Boyl has been somewhat\r\nrehabilitated by Padre Fita, S.J. (_Memoires du Congr. Amer. de\r\nMadrid_, 1881), but he can hardly be deemed comparable as a missionary\r\nto the zealous, self-sacrificing friars who followed with such perfect\r\nevangelic spirit a few years later. He was at perpetual enmity with\r\nboth the Admiral and his brother.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Pedro de Margarita had been appointed by Columbus\r\nmilitary commander in the island; his conduct was marked by\r\ningratitude towards the Admiral.]\r\n\r\nThe caciques of the island had always been contented with little, for\r\nthey lived a peaceful and tranquil life. When they saw the Spaniards\r\nestablishing themselves upon their native soil, they were considerably\r\ntroubled, and desired above all things either to expel the newcomers\r\nor to destroy them so completely that not even their memory should\r\nremain. It is a fact that the people who accompanied the Admiral in\r\nhis second voyage were for the most part undisciplined, unscrupulous\r\nvagabonds, who only employed their ingenuity in gratifying their\r\nappetites. Incapable of moderation in their acts of injustice, they\r\ncarried off the women of the islanders under the very eyes of their\r\nbrothers and their husbands; given over to violence and thieving, they\r\nhad profoundly vexed the natives. It had happened in many places that\r\nwhen our men were surprised by the natives, the latter strangled them,\r\nand offered them as sacrifices to their gods. Convinced that he should\r\nput down a general insurrection by punishing the murderers of the\r\nSpaniards, Columbus summoned the cacique of this valley, lying at the\r\nfoot off the Ciguano Mountains, which are described in the preceding\r\nbook. This cacique was called Guarionex. He had been pleased to give\r\nhis sister to be the wife of that Diego Columbus who had been from his\r\ninfancy brought up by the Admiral, and had served him as interpreter\r\nduring his occupation of Cuba. Guarionex had hoped by these means to\r\nestablish a more intimate friendship with the Admiral. He afterwards\r\nsent one of his officers to Caunaboa, cacique of the mountains of\r\nCibao, which is the gold region. The people of this Caunaboa had\r\nbesieged Hojeda and fifty soldiers in the blockhouse of San Tomas and,\r\nhad they not heard of the approaching arrival of Columbus in person at\r\nthe head of imposing reinforcements, they would never have raised the\r\nsiege.[3] The Admiral chose Hojeda as his envoy, and while the latter\r\nwas engaged in his mission, several caciques[4] sent from different\r\nparts to urge Caunaboa not to allow the Christians to settle in the\r\nisland, unless he wished to exchange independence for slavery; for if\r\nthe Christians were not expelled to the last man from the island, all\r\nthe natives would sooner or later become their slaves. Hojeda, on the\r\nother hand, negotiated with Caunaboa, urging him to come in person to\r\nvisit the Admiral, and contract a firm alliance with him. The envoys\r\nof the caciques promised Caunaboa their unlimited support for the\r\nexpulsion of the Spaniards, but Hojeda threatened to massacre him if\r\nhe chose war rather than peace with the Christians. Caunaboa was very\r\nundecided. Besides, the consciousness of his crimes disturbed him, for\r\nhe had cut off the heads of twenty of our men whom he had surprised.\r\nIf, therefore, he desired peace on the one hand, on the other he\r\nfeared the interview with the Admiral. Having carefully planned his\r\ntreachery, he decided that under cover of peace he would seize the\r\nfirst occasion to destroy Columbus and his men. He set out, escorted\r\nby all his household and a large number of soldiers, armed after the\r\nfashion of the country, to meet the Admiral. When asked why he took\r\nsuch a numerous troop of men, he answered that it was not becoming\r\nfor such a great king as he to quit his house and journey without an\r\nescort. In this event, however, things turned out differently from\r\nwhat he had expected and he fell into the net that he had himself\r\nprepared. Hardly had he left his house before he regretted his\r\ndecision, but Hojeda succeeded by flatteries and promises in bringing\r\nhim to Columbus, where he was at once seized and put in irons.[5] The\r\nsouls of our dead might rest in peace.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: A cacique of the Vega, who was a vassal of Guarionex,\r\nJuatinango by name, had succeeded in killing ten Spaniards and in\r\nsetting fire to a house which served as a hospital for forty others\r\nwho were confined there ill. After these exploits, he besieged the\r\nblockhouse of Magdalena, which Luis de Arriaga only succeeded in\r\ndefending by the greatest efforts. Herrera, _Hist. Ind_., tom, i.,\r\nlib. ii., cap. xvi.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4: The principal caciques of Hayti at that time numbered\r\nfive. They were: Caunaboa, who was the most powerful of all;\r\nGuarionex, Gauccanagari, Behechio, and Cotubanama.]\r\n\r\n[Note 5: Hojeda tricked this cacique into allowing him to fasten\r\nhandcuffs on him; after which the helpless chief was carried sixty\r\nleagues through the forests. Pizarro, in his _Varones Illustres_,\r\nrelates the story, as does likewise Herrera.]\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Caunaboa and all his household, the Admiral\r\nresolved to march throughout the whole island. He was informed that\r\nthe natives suffered from such a severe famine that more than 50,000\r\nmen had already perished, and that people continued to die daily as do\r\ncattle in time of pest.\r\n\r\nThis calamity was the consequence of their own folly; for when they\r\nsaw that the Spaniards wished to settle in their island, they thought\r\nthey might expel them by creating a scarcity of food. They, therefore,\r\ndecided not only to plant no more crops, but also to destroy and tear\r\nup all the various kinds of cereals used for bread which had already\r\nbeen sown, and which I have mentioned in the first book. This was\r\nto be done by the people in each district, and especially in the\r\nmountainous region of Cipangu and Cibao; that was the country where\r\ngold was found in abundance, and the natives were aware that the\r\nprincipal attraction which kept the Spaniards in Hispaniola was gold.\r\nAt that time the Admiral sent an officer with a troop of armed men\r\nto reconnoitre the southern coast of the island, and this officer\r\nreported that the regions he had visited had suffered to such an\r\nextent from the famine, that during six days he and his men had eaten\r\nnothing but the roots of herbs and small plants, or such fruits as\r\ngrow on the trees. Guarionex, whose territory had suffered less than\r\nthe others, distributed some provisions amongst our people.\r\n\r\nSome days later Columbus, with the object of lessening journeys and\r\nalso to provide more numerous retreats for his men in case of sudden\r\nattack by the natives, had another blockhouse built, which he called\r\nConcepcion. It is situated between Isabella and San Tomas in the\r\nterritory of Cibao, upon the frontiers of the country of Guarionex. It\r\nstands upon an elevation, well watered by a number of fresh streams.\r\nSeeing this new construction daily nearing completion, and our fleet\r\nhalf ruined lying in the port, the natives began to despair of liberty\r\nand to ask one another dejectedly whether the Christians would ever\r\nevacuate the archipelago.\r\n\r\nIt was during these explorations in the interior of the mountainous\r\ndistrict of Cibao that the men of Concepcion obtained an ingot of\r\nmassive gold, shaped in the form of a sponge-like stone; it was as\r\nlarge as a man's fist, and weighed twenty ounces. It had been found by\r\na cacique, not on a river bank but in a dry mound. I saw it with my\r\nown eyes in a shop at Medina del Campo in Old Castile, where the Court\r\nwas passing the winter; and to my great admiration I handled it and\r\ntested its weight. I also saw a piece of native tin, which might have\r\nserved for bells or apothecaries' mortars or other such things as are\r\nmade of Corinthian brass. It was so heavy that not only could I not\r\nlift it from the ground with my two hands, but could not even move it\r\nto the right or left. It was said that this lump weighed more than\r\nthree hundred pounds at eight ounces to the pound. It had been found\r\nin the courtyard of a cacique's house, where it had lain for a long\r\ntime, and the old people of the country, although no tin has been\r\nfound in the island within the memory of any living man, nevertheless\r\nknew where there was a mine of this metal. But nobody could ever learn\r\nthis secret from them, so much were they vexed by the Spaniards'\r\npresence.[6] Finally they decided to reveal its whereabouts, but it\r\nwas entirely destroyed, and filled in with earth and rubbish. It is\r\nnevertheless easier to extract the metal than to get out iron from the\r\nmines, and it is thought that if workmen and skilled miners were sent\r\nout, it would be possible to again work that tin mine.\r\n\r\n[Note 6: _Adeo jam stomacho pleni in nostros vivebant_.]\r\n\r\nNot far from the blockhouse of Concepcion and in these same mountains,\r\nthe Spaniards discovered a large quantity of amber, and in some\r\ncaverns was distilled a greenish colour very much prized by painters.\r\nIn marching through the forest there were places where all the trees\r\nwere of a scarlet colour which are called by Italian merchants\r\n_verzino_, and by the Spaniards brazil wood.\r\n\r\nAt this point, Most Illustrious Prince, you may raise an objection and\r\nsay to yourself: \"If the Spaniards have brought several shiploads of\r\nscarlet wood and some gold, and a little cotton and some bits of amber\r\nback to Europe, why did they not load themselves with gold and all the\r\nprecious products which seem to abound so plenteously in the country\r\nyou describe?\"\r\n\r\nColumbus answered such questions by saying that the men he had taken\r\nwith him thought more of sleeping and taking their ease than about\r\nwork, and they preferred fighting and rebellion to peace and\r\ntranquillity. The greater part of these men deserted him. To establish\r\nuncontested authority over the island, it was necessary to conquer\r\nthe islanders and to break their power. The Spaniards have indeed\r\npretended that they could not endure the cruelty and hardship of the\r\nAdmiral's orders, and they have formulated many accusations against\r\nhim. It is in consequence of these difficulties that he has not so\r\nfar thought about covering the expenses of the expeditions. I will\r\nnevertheless observe that in this same year, 1501, in which I am\r\nwriting to you, the Spaniards have gathered 1200 pounds of gold in two\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to our narrative. At the proper time I will\r\ndescribe to you in detail what I have only just touched upon in this\r\ndigression.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral was perfectly aware of the alarm and disturbance that\r\nprevailed amongst the islanders, but he was unable to prevent the\r\nviolence and rapacity of his men, whenever they came into contact\r\nwith the natives. A number of the principal caciques of the frontier\r\nregions assembled to beg Columbus to forbid the Spaniards to wander\r\nabout the island because, under the pretext of hunting for gold or\r\nother local products, they left nothing uninjured or undefiled.\r\nMoreover, all the natives between the ages of fourteen and seventy\r\nyears bound themselves to pay him tribute in the products of the\r\ncountry at so much per head, promising to fulfil their engagement.\r\nSome of the conditions of this agreement were as follows: The\r\nmountaineers of Cibao were to bring to the town every three months a\r\nspecified measure filled with gold. They reckon by the moon and\r\ncall the months moons. The islanders who cultivated the lands which\r\nspontaneously produced spices and cotton, were pledged to pay a fixed\r\nsum per head. This pact suited both parties, and it would have been\r\nobserved by both sides as had been agreed, save that the famine\r\nnullified their resolutions. The natives had hardly strength to hunt\r\nfood in the forests and for a long time they contented themselves\r\nwith roots, herbs, and wild fruits. Nevertheless the majority of the\r\ncaciques, aided by their followers, did bring part of the established\r\ntribute. They begged as a favour of the Admiral to have pity on their\r\nmisery, and to exempt them till such time as the island might recover\r\nits former prosperity. They bound themselves then to pay double what\r\nwas for the moment failing.\r\n\r\nOwing to the famine, which had affected them more cruelly than the\r\nothers, very few of the mountaineers of Cibao paid tribute. These\r\nmountaineers did not differ in their customs and language from the\r\npeople of the plain more than do the mountaineers of other countries\r\ndiffer from those who live in the capital. There exist amongst them,\r\nhowever, some points of resemblance, since they lead the same kind of\r\nsimple, open-air life.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to Caunaboa, who, if you remember, had been taken\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nThis cacique, when he found himself put in irons, gnashed his teeth\r\nlike an African lion and fell to thinking, night and day, upon the\r\nmeans to recover his liberty.[7] He begged the Admiral, since the\r\nregion of Cipangu was now under his authority, to send Spanish\r\ngarrisons to protect the country against the attacks of neighbours who\r\nwere his ancient enemies. He said that it was reported to him that the\r\ncountry was ravaged, and the property of his subjects considered by\r\nhis enemies as their lawful plunder. As a matter of fact it was a trap\r\nhe was preparing. He hoped that his brother and other relatives in\r\nCibao would, either by force or by trickery, capture as many Spaniards\r\nas would be required to pay his ransom. Divining this plot, Columbus\r\nsent Hojeda, but with an escort of soldiers sufficient to overcome\r\nall resistance of the inhabitants of Cibao. Hardly had the Spaniards\r\nentered that region when the brother of Caunaboa assembled about 5000\r\nmen, equipped in their fashion, that is to say, naked, armed with\r\narrows without iron points, clubs, and spears. He succeeded in\r\nsurrounding the Spaniards, and held them besieged in a small house.\r\nThis chief showed himself under the circumstances to be a veritable\r\nsoldier. When he had approached within a distance of one stadium, he\r\ndivided his men into five groups, stationing them in a circle, and\r\nassigning to each one his post, while he himself marched directly\r\nagainst the Spaniards. When all his arrangements were completed, he\r\nordered his soldiers to advance, shouting all together, so as to\r\nengage in a hand-to-hand combat. He hoped that, by thus surrounding\r\nthe Spaniards, none of them would escape. But our men, persuaded that\r\nit was better to attack than to await their assault, fell upon the\r\nmost numerous band they saw in the open country. The ground was\r\nadapted for cavalry manoeuvres and the horsemen, opening their charge,\r\nrode down the enemy, who were easily put to flight. Those who awaited\r\nthe encounter were massacred; the others, overcome with fright, fled,\r\nabandoning their huts, and seeking refuge in the mountains and upon\r\ninaccessible rocks. They begged for mercy, promising and swearing\r\nto observe all the conditions imposed upon them, if they were only\r\npermitted to live with their families. The brother of the cacique was\r\nfinally captured, and each of his men was sent to his own home. After\r\nthis victory that region was pacified.\r\n\r\n[Note 7: Las Casas (_Hist, de las Indias_, tom, i., p. 102)\r\nrelates that Caunaboa never forgave Columbus for his treatment of him,\r\nwhile he had, on the contrary, great respect for Hojeda, the latter's\r\nclever ruse, deftly executed, being precisely the kind of trickery he\r\nwas able to appreciate and admire.]\r\n\r\nThe mountain valley where the cacique lived is called Magona. It\r\nis traversed by auriferous rivers, is generously productive and\r\nmarvellously fertile. In the month of June of this same year occurred\r\na frightful tempest; whirlwinds reaching to the skies uprooted the\r\nlargest trees that were swept within their vortex. When this typhoon\r\nreached the port of Isabella, only three ships were riding at anchor;\r\ntheir cables were broken, and after three or four shocks--though\r\nthere was no tempest or tide at the time--they sank. It is said that\r\nin that year the sea penetrated more deeply than usual into the earth,\r\nand that it rose more than a cubit. The natives whispered that the\r\nSpaniards were the cause of this disturbance of the elements and these\r\ncatastrophes. These tempests, which the Greeks called typhoons, are\r\ncalled by the natives _huracanes_.[8] According to their accounts\r\nhurricanes are sufficiently frequent in the island, but they never\r\nattain such violence and fury. None of the islanders living, nor any\r\nof their ancestors remembers that such an atmospheric disturbance,\r\ncapable of uprooting the greatest trees, had ever swept the island;\r\nnor, on the other hand, had the sea ever been so turbulent, or the\r\ntidewater so ravaged. Wherever plains border the sea, flowery meadows\r\nare found nearby.\r\n\r\n[Note 8: The word _hurricane_ is from _Hurakan_, the name of the\r\ngod or culture hero who, in the mythology of Yucatan, corresponded to\r\nQuetzalcoatl of the Mexicans. Being the god of the winds, storms were\r\nascribed to his fury, and the typhoons and tempests which broke out\r\nat times with destructive violence over the seas and countries were\r\ncalled by his name.]\r\n\r\nLet us now return to Caunaboa. When it was sought to take them to the\r\nsovereigns of Spain, both he and his brother died of grief on\r\nthe voyage. The destruction of his ships detained the Admiral at\r\nHispaniola; but, as he had at his disposal the necessary artisans, he\r\nordered two caravels to be built immediately.\r\n\r\nWhile these orders were being carried out, he despatched his brother,\r\nBartholomew Columbus,--Adelantado, the Spaniards call him, of the\r\nisland,--with a number of miners and a troop of soldiers, to the gold\r\nmines, which had been discovered by the assistance of the natives\r\nsixty leagues from Isabella in the direction of Cipangu, As some\r\nvery ancient pits were found there, the Admiral believed that he had\r\nrediscovered in those mines the ancient treasures which, it is stated\r\nin the Old Testament, King Solomon of Jerusalem had found in the\r\nPersian Gulf. Whether this be true or false is not for me to decide.\r\nThese mines cover an area of six miles. The miners, in sifting some\r\ndry earth gathered at different places, declared that they had found\r\nsuch a great quantity of gold hidden in that earth that a miner could\r\neasily collect three drachmas in a day's work. After they had\r\nexplored that region, the Adelantado and the miners wrote to Columbus\r\nacquainting him with their discovery. The ships being then ready,\r\nColumbus immediately and with great delight embarked to return to\r\nSpain; that is to say, the fifth day of the ides of March in the year\r\n1495.[9] He confided the government of the province with full powers\r\nto his brother, the Adelantado, Bartholomew Columbus.\r\n\r\n[Note 9: Columbus sailed on March 10, 1496.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\nTO CARDINAL LUDOVICO D'ARAGON, NEPHEW OF OUR KING\r\n\r\n\r\nActing upon the parting counsel of his brother, the Adelantado,\r\nBartholomew Columbus, constructed a blockhouse at the mines, which\r\nhe called El Dorado,[1] because the labourers discovered gold in the\r\nearth with which they were building its walls. It required three\r\nmonths to manufacture the necessary tools for washing and sifting the\r\ngold, but famine obliged him to abandon this enterprise before it\r\nwas terminated. At a place sixty miles farther on, where he and the\r\ngreater part of his soldiers went, he succeeded in procuring from the\r\nislanders a small quantity of the bread they make, to such a bad state\r\nwere affairs at that time reduced. Unable to prolong his stay, he left\r\nten men at El Dorado, furnishing them with a small part of the bread\r\nthat remained. He moreover left with them an excellent hunting dog for\r\nchasing the game, which I have above said resembles our rabbits, and\r\nwhich are called _utias_; after which he left to return to Concepcion.\r\nIt was at that time that the tribute from the caique Guarionex and one\r\nof his neighbours called Manicavex was due. The Adelantado remained\r\nthere the whole month of June, and obtained from the caciques, not\r\nonly the sum total of the tribute, but also provisions necessary to\r\nsupport himself and the 400 men of his escort.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: The name first given to the place was San Cristobal.]\r\n\r\nAbout the calends of July three caravels arrived, bringing\r\nprovisions--wheat, oil, wine, and salted pork and beef. In obedience\r\nto the orders from Spain, they were distributed amongst all the\r\nEuropeans, but as some of the provisions had rotted, or were spoiled\r\nby the damp, people complained. Fresh instructions from the sovereigns\r\nand from the Admiral were sent to Bartholomew Columbus by these ships.\r\nAfter frequent interviews with the sovereigns, Columbus directed his\r\nbrother to transfer his residence to the southern coast of the island,\r\nnearer to the mines. He was likewise ordered to send back to Spain,\r\nin chains, the caciques who had been convicted of assassinating the\r\nChristians, and also those of their subjects who had shared their\r\ncrimes; Three hundred islanders were thus transported to Spain.[2]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: This transport marks the beginning of the slave trade in\r\nAmerica.]\r\n\r\nAfter having carefully explored the coast, the Adelantado transferred\r\nhis residence and built a lofty blockhouse near a safe harbour, naming\r\nthe fort Santo Domingo, because he had arrived at that place on a\r\nSunday. There flows into that harbour a river, whose wholesome waters\r\nabound in excellent fish, and whose banks are delightfully wooded.\r\nThis river has some unusual natural features. Wherever its waters\r\nflow, the most useful and agreeable products flourish, such as palms\r\nand fruits of all kinds. The trees sometimes droop their branches,\r\nweighted with flowers and fruit over the heads of the Spaniards, who\r\ndeclare that the soil of Santo Domingo is as fertile, or even perhaps\r\nmore so, than at Hispaniola. At Isabella there only remained the\r\ninvalids and some engineers to complete the construction of two\r\ncaravels which had been begun, all the other colonists coming south\r\nto Santo Domingo. When the blockhouse was finished, he placed there\r\na garrison of twenty men, and prepared to lead the remainder of his\r\npeople on a tour of exploration through the western parts of the\r\nisland, of which not even the name was known. Thirty leagues distant\r\nfrom Santo Domingo, that is to say, at the ninetieth mile, they came\r\nupon the river Naiba, which flows south from the mountains of Cibao\r\nand divides the island into two equal parts. The Adelantado crossed\r\nthis river, and sent two captains, each with an escort of twenty-five\r\nsoldiers, to explore the territory of the caciques who possessed\r\nforests of red trees. These men, marching to the left, came upon\r\nforests, in which they cut down magnificent trees of great value,\r\nheretofore respected. The captains piled the red-coloured wood in the\r\nhuts of the natives, wishing thus to protect it until they could load\r\nit on the ships. During this time the Adelantado, who had marched to\r\nthe right, had encountered at a place not far from the river Naiba\r\na powerful cacique, named Beuchios Anacauchoa, who was at that time\r\nengaged in an expedition to conquer the people along the river, as\r\nwell as some other caciques of the island. This powerful chieftain\r\nlives at the western extremity of the island, called Xaragua. This\r\nrugged and mountainous country is thirty leagues distant from the\r\nriver Naiba, but all the caciques whose territory lies in between are\r\nsubject to him.[3] All that country from the Naiba to the western\r\nextremity produces no gold. Anacauchoa, observing that our men put\r\ndown their arms and made him amicable signs, adopted a responsive air,\r\neither from fear or from courtesy, and asked them what they wanted of\r\nhim. The Adelantado replied: \"We wish you to pay the same tribute\r\nto my brother, who is in command here in the name of the Spanish\r\nsovereigns, as do the other caciques.\" To which he answered: \"How can\r\nyou ask tribute from me, since none of the numerous provinces under my\r\nauthority produce gold?\" He had learned that strangers in search of\r\ngold had landed on the island, and he did not suspect that our men\r\nwould ask for anything else. \"We do not pretend,\" continued the\r\nAdelantado, \"to exact tribute from anybody which cannot be easily\r\npaid, or of a kind not obtainable; but we know that this country\r\nproduces an abundance of cotton, hemp, and other similar things, and\r\nwe ask you to pay tribute of those products.\" The cacique's face\r\nexpressed joy on hearing these words, and with a satisfied air he\r\nagreed to give what he was asked, and in whatever quantities they\r\ndesired; for he sent away his men, and after despatching messengers in\r\nadvance, he himself acted as guide for the Adelantado, conducting him\r\nto his residence, which, as we have already said, was situated about\r\nthirty leagues distant. The march led through the countries of subject\r\ncaciques; and upon some of them a tribute of hemp was imposed, for\r\nthis hemp is quite as good as our flax for weaving ships' sails;\r\nupon others, of bread, and upon others, of cotton, according to the\r\nproducts of each region.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: Xaragua includes the entire western coast from Cape\r\nTiburon to the island of Beata on the south.]\r\n\r\nWhen they finally arrived at the chieftain's residence in Xaragua,\r\nthe natives came out to meet them, and, as is their custom, offered\r\na triumphal reception to their king, Beuchios Anacauchoa, and to our\r\nmen. Please note amongst other usages these two, which are remarkable\r\namongst naked and uncultivated people. When the company approached,\r\nsome thirty women, all wives of the cacique, marched out to meet\r\nthem, dancing, singing, and shouting; they were naked, save for a\r\nloin-girdle, which, though it consisted but of a cotton belt, which\r\ndropped over their hips, satisfied these women devoid of any sense of\r\nshame. As for the young girls, they covered no part of their bodies,\r\nbut wore their hair loose upon their shoulders and a narrow ribbon\r\ntied around the forehead. Their face, breast, and hands, and the\r\nentire body was quite naked, and of a somewhat brunette tint. All were\r\nbeautiful, so that one might think he beheld those splendid naiads or\r\nnymphs of the fountains, so much celebrated by the ancients. Holding\r\nbranches of palms in their hands, they danced to an accompaniment of\r\nsongs, and bending the knee, they offered them to the Adelantado.\r\nEntering the chieftain's house, the Spaniards refreshed themselves at\r\na banquet prepared with all the magnificence of native usage. When\r\nnight came, each, according to his rank, was escorted by servants\r\nof the cacique to houses where those hanging beds I have already\r\ndescribed were assigned to them, and there they rested.\r\n\r\nNext day they were conducted to a building which served as a theatre,\r\nwhere they witnessed dances and listened to songs, after which two\r\nnumerous troops of armed men suddenly appeared upon a large open\r\nspace, the king having thought to please and interest the Spaniards by\r\nhaving them exercised, just as in Spain Trojan games (that is to say,\r\ntourneys) are celebrated. The two armies advanced and engaged in\r\nas animated a combat as though they were fighting to defend their\r\nproperty, their homes, their children or their lives. With such vigour\r\ndid they contest, in the presence of their chieftain, that within the\r\nshort space of an hour four soldiers were killed and a number were\r\nwounded; and it was only at the instance of the Spaniards that the\r\ncacique gave the signal for them to lay down their arms and cease\r\nfighting. After having advised the cacique to henceforth plant more\r\ncotton along the river banks, in order that he might more easily pay\r\nthe tribute imposed on each household, the Adelantado left on the\r\nthird day for Isabella to visit the invalids, and to see the ships in\r\nconstruction. About three hundred of his men had fallen victims to\r\ndivers maladies, and he was therefore much concerned and hardly knew\r\nwhat course to adopt, for everything was lacking, not only for caring\r\nfor the sick, but also for the necessities of life; since no ship had\r\narrived from Spain to put an end to his uncertainty, he ordered\r\nthe invalids to be distributed in the several blockhouses built in\r\ndifferent provinces. These citadels, existing in a straight line from\r\nIsabella to Santo Domingo, that is to say, from north to south,\r\nwere as follows: thirty-six miles from Isabella stood Esperanza;\r\ntwenty-four miles beyond Esperanza came Santa Caterina; twenty miles\r\nbeyond Santa Caterina, Santiago. Twenty miles beyond Santiago had been\r\nconstructed a fortification stronger than any of the others; for it\r\nstood at the foot of the mountains of Cibao, in a broad and fertile\r\nplain which was well peopled. This was called La Concepcion. Between\r\nLa Concepcion and Santo Domingo, the Adelantado built an even stronger\r\nfortress, which stood in the territory of a chieftain, who was obeyed\r\nby several thousands of subjects. As the natives called the village\r\nwhere their cacique lived, _Bonana_, the Adelantado wished the\r\nfortress to have the same name.\r\n\r\nHaving distributed the invalids amongst these fortresses or in the\r\nhouses of the natives in the neighbourhood, the Adelantado left for\r\nSanto Domingo, collecting tribute from the caciques he encountered on\r\nhis way. He had been at Santo Domingo but a few days when the report\r\nwas brought that two of the caciques in the neighbourhood of La\r\nConcepcion were driven to desperation by the Spaniards' rule, and were\r\nplanning a revolt. Upon the reception of this news he set out for that\r\nregion by rapid marches.\r\n\r\nHe learned upon his arrival that Guarionex had been chosen by the\r\nother caciques as their commander-in-chief. Although he had already\r\ntested and had reason to fear our arms and our tactics, he had allowed\r\nhimself to be partly won over. The caciques had planned a rising of\r\nabout 15,000 men, armed in their fashion, for a fixed day, thus making\r\na new appeal to the fortunes of battle. After consultation with the\r\ncommander at La Concepcion and the soldiers he had with him, the\r\nAdelantado determined to take the caciques in their villages, while\r\nthey were off their guard and before they had assembled their\r\nsoldiers. Captains were thus sent against the caciques, and surprising\r\nthem in their sleep, before their scattered subjects could collect,\r\ninvaded their houses which were unprotected either by ditches, walls,\r\nor entrenchments; they attacked and seized them, binding them with\r\ncords, and bringing them, as they had been ordered, to the Adelantado.\r\nThe latter had dealt with Guarionex himself, as he was the most\r\nformidable enemy, and had seized him at the appointed hour. Fourteen\r\ncaciques were thus brought prisoners to La Concepcion, and shortly\r\nafterwards two of those who had corrupted Guarionex and the others,\r\nand who had favoured the revolt were condemned to death. Guarionex and\r\nthe rest were released, for the Adelantado feared that the natives,\r\naffected by the death of the caciques, might abandon their fields,\r\nwhich would have occasioned a grievous damage to our people, because\r\nof the crops. About six thousand of their subjects had come to solicit\r\ntheir freedom. These people had laid down their arms, making the air\r\nring and the earth shake with their clamour. The Adelantado spoke to\r\nGuarionex and the other caciques, and by means of promises, presents,\r\nand threats, charged them to take good care for the future to engage\r\nin no further revolt. Guarionex made a speech to the people, in which\r\nhe praised our power, our clemency to the guilty, and our generosity\r\nto those who remained faithful; he exhorted them to calm their spirits\r\nand for the future neither to think nor to plan any hostilities\r\nagainst the Christians, but rather to be obedient, humble, and\r\nserviceable to them, unless they wished worse things to overtake\r\nthem. When he had finished his speech, his people took him on their\r\nshoulders in a hammock, and in this wise they carried him to the\r\nvillage where he lived, and within a few days the entire country was\r\npacified.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the Spaniards were disturbed and depressed, for they\r\nfound themselves abandoned in a strange country. Fifteen months had\r\nelapsed since the departure of the Admiral. The clothes and the food\r\nto which they were accustomed were wanting, and so they marched with\r\nsad faces and eyes bent on the ground.[4] The Adelantado strove\r\nas best he might to offer consolation. At this juncture, Beuchios\r\nAnacauchoa, for such was the name of the king of the western province\r\nof Xaragua of which we have before spoken, sent to the Adelantado\r\nnotifying him that the cotton and other tribute he and his subjects\r\nwere to pay, were ready. Bartholomew Columbus marched thither,\r\ntherefore, and was received with great honours, by the cacique and by\r\nhis sister. This woman, formerly the wife of Caunaboa, King of Cibao,\r\nwas held in as great esteem throughout the kingdom as her brother.\r\nIt seems she was gracious, clever, and prudent.[5] Having learned a\r\nlesson from the example of her husband, she had persuaded her brother\r\nto submit to the Christians, to soothe and to please them. This woman\r\nwas called Anacaona.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: The story of the disorders, privations, and unrest, as\r\ntold by Las Casas, Columbus, and others, makes cheerless reading; the\r\nmisfortunes of the colonists were due to their inveterate idleness,\r\ntheir tyranny, which had alienated the good-will of the natives, and\r\nto the disillusionment that had dispersed their hope of speedily and\r\neasily won riches.]\r\n\r\n[Note 5: Herrera (iii., 6) speaks of her as _la insigne Anacaona\r\n... mujer prudente y entendida_... etc. She composed with unusual\r\ntalent the _arreytos_ or folk-ballads the natives were fond of\r\nsinging. Las Casas describes her dreadful death in his _Brevissima\r\nRelacion_.]\r\n\r\nThirty-two caciques were assembled in the house of Anacauchoa, where\r\nthey had brought their tribute. In addition to what had been agreed\r\nupon, they sought to win favour by adding numerous presents, which\r\nconsisted of two kinds of bread, roots, grains, utias, that is to\r\nsay, rabbits, which are numerous in the island, fish, which they\r\nhad preserved by cooking them, and those same serpents, resembling\r\ncrocodiles, which they esteem a most delicate food. We have described\r\nthem above, and the natives call them iguanas. They are special to\r\nHispaniola.[6] Up to that time none of the Spaniards had ventured to\r\neat them because of their odour, which was not only repugnant but\r\nnauseating, but the Adelantado, won by the amiability of the cacique's\r\nsister, consented to taste a morsel of iguana; and hardly had his\r\npalate savoured this succulent flesh than he began to eat it by the\r\nmouthful. Henceforth the Spaniards were no longer satisfied to barely\r\ntaste it, but became epicures in regard to it, and talked of nothing\r\nelse than the exquisite flavour of these serpents, which they found\r\nto be superior to that of peacocks, pheasants, or partridges. If,\r\nhowever, they are cooked as we do peacocks and pheasants, which are\r\nfirst larded and then roasted, the serpent's flesh loses its good\r\nflavour. First they gut them, then wash and clean them with care,\r\nand roll them into a circle, so that they look like the coils of a\r\nsleeping snake; after which they put them in a pot, just large enough\r\nto hold them, pouring over them a little water flavoured with the\r\npepper found in the island. The pot is covered and a fire of odorous\r\nwood which gives very little light is kindled underneath it. A juice\r\nas delicious as nectar runs drop by drop from the insides. It is\r\nreported that there are few dishes more appetising than iguana eggs\r\ncooked over a slow fire. When they are fresh and served hot they are\r\ndelicious, but if they are preserved for a few days they still further\r\nimprove. But this is enough about cooking recipes. Let us pass on to\r\nother subjects.\r\n\r\n[Note 6: Iguanas are found in all the _tierras calientes_ of the\r\ncontinent.]\r\n\r\nThe tribute of cotton sent by the caciques filled the Adelantado's\r\nhut, and, in addition, he accepted their promise to furnish him all\r\nthe bread he needed. While waiting for the bread to be made in the\r\ndifferent districts, and brought to the house of Beuchios Anacauchoa,\r\nKing of Xaragua, he sent to Isabella directing that one of the\r\ncaravels he had ordered to be built be brought to him, promising the\r\ncolonists that he would send it back to them loaded with bread. The\r\ndelighted sailors made the tour of the island with alacrity, and\r\nlanded on the coast of Xaragua. As soon as that brilliant, prudent,\r\nand sensible woman called Anacaona, sister of Beuchios Anacauchoa,\r\nheard that our ship had reached the coast of her country, she\r\npersuaded her brother to accompany her to visit it. The distance from\r\nthe royal residence to the coast was only six miles. They halted\r\nfor the night at a village about halfway, where the queen kept her\r\ntreasure; this treasure did not consist of gold, silver, or pearls,\r\nbut of utensils necessary to the different requirements of life, such\r\nas seats, platters, basins, cauldrons, and plates made of black wood,\r\nbrilliantly polished; they display great art in the manufacture of\r\nall these articles. That distinguished savant, your doctor, Joannes\r\nBaptista Elysius, thinks that this black wood is ebony. It is to the\r\nmanufacture of these articles that the islanders devote the best of\r\ntheir native ingenuity. In the island of Ganabara which, if you have\r\na map, you will see lies at the western extermity of Hispaniola and\r\nwhich is subject to Anacauchoa, it is the women who are thus employed;\r\nthe various pieces are decorated with representations of phantoms\r\nwhich they pretend to see in the nighttime, and serpents and men and\r\neverything that they see about them. What would they not be able to\r\nmanufacture, Most Illustrious Prince, if they knew the use of iron and\r\nsteel? They begin by softening the inner part of pieces of wood in the\r\nfire, after which they dig them out and work them with shells from the\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nAnacaona presented to the Adelantado fourteen seats and sixty earthen\r\nvessels for the kitchen, besides four rolls of woven cotton of immense\r\nweight. When they all reached the shore where the other royal town is\r\nsituated, the Adelantado ordered out a barque fully equipped. The king\r\nalso commanded two canoes to be launched, the first for the use\r\nof himself and his attendants, the second for his sister and her\r\nfollowers, but Anacaona was unwilling to embark on any other than the\r\nboat which carried the Adelantado. As they approached the ship, a\r\ncannon was fired at a given signal. The sound echoed over the sea like\r\nthunder, and the air was filled with smoke. The terrified islanders\r\ntrembled, believing that this detonation had shattered the terrestrial\r\nglobe; but when they turned towards the Adelantado their emotion\r\nsubsided. Upon approaching closer to the ship the sound of flutes,\r\nfifes, and drums was heard, charming their senses by sweet music, and\r\nawakening their astonishment and admiration. When they had been over\r\nthe whole ship, from stern to prow, and had carefully visited the\r\nforecastle, the tiller, and the hold, the brother and sister looked at\r\none another in silence; their astonishment being so profound that they\r\nhad nothing to say. While they were engaged in visiting the ship, the\r\nAdelantado ordered the anchor to be raised, the sails set, and to\r\nput out on the high sea. Their astonishment was redoubled when they\r\nobserved that, without oars or the employment of any human force, such\r\na great boat flew over the surface of the water. It was blowing a land\r\nwind, which was favourable to this manoeuvre, and what astonished them\r\nmost was to see that the ship which was advanced by the help of this\r\nwind likewise turned about, first to the right and then to the left,\r\naccording to the captain's will.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of these manoeuvres the ship was loaded with bread,\r\nroots, and other gifts, and the Adelantado after offering them some\r\npresents took leave of Beuchios Anacauchoa and his sister, their\r\nfollowers and servants of both sexes. The impression left upon the\r\nlatter by this visit was stupefying. The Spaniards marched overland\r\nand returned to Isabella. On arriving there, it was learned that\r\na certain Ximenes Roldan, formerly chief of the miners and\r\ncamp-followers, whom the Admiral had made his equerry and raised to\r\nthe grade of chief justice, was ill-disposed towards the Adelantado.\r\nIt was simultaneously ascertained that the Cacique Guarionex, unable\r\nlonger to put up with the rapacity of Roldan and the other Spaniards\r\nat Isabella, had been driven by despair to quit the country with\r\nhis family and a large number of his subjects, taking refuge in the\r\nmountains which border the northern coast only ten leagues to the west\r\nof Isabella. Both these mountains and their inhabitants bear the same\r\nname, _Ciguaia_. The chief of all the caciques inhabiting the mountain\r\nregion is called Maiobanexios, who lived at a place called Capronus.\r\nThese mountains are rugged, lofty, inaccessible, and rise from the sea\r\nin a semicircle. Between the two extremities of the chain, there lies\r\na beautiful plain, watered by numerous rivers which rise in these\r\nmountains. The natives are ferocious and warlike, and it is thought\r\nthey are of the same race as the cannibals, for when they descend from\r\ntheir mountains to fight with their neighbours in the plain, they eat\r\nall whom they kill. It was with the cacique of these mountains that\r\nGuarionex took refuge, bringing him gifts, consisting of things which\r\nthe mountaineers lack. He told him that the Spaniards had spared him\r\nneither ill-treatment nor humiliation nor violence, while neither\r\nhumility nor pride had been of the least use in his dealings with\r\nthem. He came, therefore, to him as a suppliant, hoping to be\r\nprotected against the injustice of these criminals. Maiobanexios\r\npromised him help and succour to the extent of his power.\r\n\r\nHastening back to La Concepcion the Adelantado summoned Ximenes\r\nRoldan, who, accompanied by his adherents, was prowling amongst the\r\nvillages of the island, to appear before him. Greatly irritated,\r\nthe Adelantado asked him what his intentions were. To which Roldan\r\nimpudently answered: \"Your brother, the Admiral is dead, and we fully\r\nunderstand that our sovereigns have little care for us. Were we to\r\nobey you, we should die of hunger, and we are forced to hunt for\r\nprovisions in the island. Moreover, the Admiral confided to me, as\r\nwell as to you, the government of the island; hence, we are determined\r\nto obey you no longer.\" He added other equally misplaced observations.\r\nBefore the Adelantado could capture him, Roldan, followed by about\r\nseventy men, escaped to Xaragua in the western part of the island,\r\nwhere, as the Adelantado reported to his brother, they gave themselves\r\nover to violence, thievery, and massacre.[7]\r\n\r\n[Note 7: Some of the principal colonists, including Valdiviesso\r\nand Diego de Escobar, favoured Roldan. The sketchy description of this\r\nnotable rebellion here given may be completed by consulting Herrera,\r\nDec. I., 3, i.; Fernando Columbus, _Storia del Almirante_; Irving,\r\n_Columbus and his Companions_, book xi., caps iv., v., etc.]\r\n\r\nWhile these disturbances were in progress, the Spanish sovereigns\r\nfinally granted the Admiral eight vessels, which Columbus promptly\r\nordered to sail from the town of Cadiz, a city consecrated to\r\nHercules. These ships were freighted with provisions for the\r\nAdelantado. By chance they approached the western coast of the island,\r\nwhere Ximenes Roldan and his accomplices were. Roldan won over the\r\ncrews by promising them fresh young girls instead of manual labour,\r\npleasures instead of exertion, plenty in place of famine, and repose\r\ninstead weariness and watching.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Guarionex, who had assembled a troop of allies,\r\nmade frequent descents upon the plain, killing all the Christians\r\nhe surprised, ravaging the fields, driving off the workmen, and\r\ndestroying villages.\r\n\r\nAlthough Roldan and his followers were not ignorant that the Admiral\r\nmight arrive from one day to another, they had no fears, since they\r\nhad won over to their side the crews of the ships that had been sent\r\non ahead. In the midst of such miseries did the unfortunate Adelantado\r\nawait from day to day the arrival of his brother. The Admiral sailed\r\nfrom Spain with the remainder of the squadron but instead of sailing\r\ndirectly to Hispaniola, he first laid his course to the south.[8] What\r\nhe accomplished during this new voyage, what seas and countries he\r\nvisited, what unknown lands he discovered, I shall narrate, and I\r\nshall also explain at length the sequel of these disorders in the\r\nfollowing books. Fare you well.\r\n\r\n[Note 8: This was the third voyage of Columbus, concerning which\r\nsome of the best sources of information are as follows: Oviedo, _Hist.\r\nGen. de las Indias_, lib. iii., 2, 4; Navarrete, tom iii., _Lettera di\r\nSimone Verde a Mateo Curi_; Fernando Columbus, _op. cit_.; Herrera,\r\ndec. i., 7; R.H. Major, Hakluyt Society, 1870, _Select Letters of\r\nColumbus_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME CARDINAL LUDOVICO D'ARAGON\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the third day of the calends of June, 1498,[1] Columbus sailed from\r\nthe port of San Lucar de Barrameda, which is situated at the mouth\r\nof the Guadalquivir not far from Cadiz. His fleet consisted of eight\r\nheavily freighted ships. He avoided his usual route by way of the\r\nCanaries, because of certain French pirates who were lying in wait for\r\nhim. Seven hundred and twenty miles north of the Fortunate Isles he\r\nsighted Madeira, which lies four degrees to the south of Seville; for\r\nat Seville, according to the mariners' report, the north star rises\r\nto the 36th degree, whereas at Madeira it is in the 32d. Madeira was,\r\ntherefore, his first stop, and from thence he despatched five or six\r\nships loaded with provisions directly to Hispaniola, only keeping for\r\nhimself one ship with decks and two merchant caravels. He laid his\r\ncourse due south and reached the equinoctial line, which he purposed\r\nto follow directly to the west, making new discoveries and leaving\r\nHispaniola to the north on his starboard side. The thirteen islands\r\nof the Hesperides lie in the track of this voyage. They belong to the\r\nPortuguese, and all, save one, are inhabited. They are called the Cape\r\nVerde islands, and are distant only a day's sail from the western part\r\nof Ethiopia. To one of these islands the Portuguese have given the\r\nname of Bona Vista[2]; and each year numerous lepers are cured of\r\ntheir malady by eating the turtles of this island.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: The date was May 30, 1498, and the number of ships under\r\nhis command was six, instead of eight. Much delay had occurred in\r\nfitting out the fleet for the voyage, owing to the poor management of\r\nthe royal functionaries, especially the Bishop of Burgos, whose enmity\r\ntowards Columbus was from thenceforward relentless.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Properly _Boavista_. A leper colony had been established\r\nhere by the Portuguese.]\r\n\r\nThe climate being very bad, the Admiral quickly left the archipelago\r\nbehind, and sailed 480 miles towards the west-south-west. He reports\r\nthat the dead calms and the fierce heat of the June sun caused such\r\nsufferings that his ships almost took fire. The hoops of his water\r\nbarrels burst, and the water leaked out. His men found this heat\r\nintolerable. The pole star was then at an elevation of five degrees.\r\nOf the eight days during which they endured these sufferings only the\r\nfirst was clear; the others being cloudy and rainy, but not on that\r\naccount less oppressive. More than once, indeed, did he repent having\r\ntaken this course. After eight days of these miseries a favourable\r\nwind rose from the south-west, by which the Admiral profited to sail\r\ndirectly west, and under this parallel he observed new stars in the\r\nheavens, and experienced a more agreeable temperature. In fact,\r\nall his men agree in saying that after three days' sailing in that\r\ndirection, the air was much cooler. The Admiral affirms that, while\r\nhe was in the region of dead calms and torrid heat, the ship always\r\nmounted the back of the sea, just as when climbing a high mountain one\r\nseems to advance towards the sky, and yet, nevertheless, he had seen\r\nno land on the horizon. Finally, on the eve of the calends of July, a\r\nwatcher announced with a joyful cry, from the crow's nest, that he saw\r\nthree lofty mountains.[3] He exhorted his companions to keep up their\r\ncourage. The men were, indeed, much depressed, not merely because they\r\nhad been scorched by the sun, but because the water-supply was short.\r\nThe barrels had been sprung by the extreme heat, and lost the water\r\nthrough the cracks. Full of rejoicing they advanced, but as they were\r\nabout to touch land they perceived that this was impossible, because\r\nthe sea was dotted with reefs, although in the neighbourhood they\r\ndescried a harbour which seemed a spacious one. From their ships\r\nthe Spaniards could see that the country was inhabited and well\r\ncultivated; for they saw well-ordered gardens and shady orchards,\r\nwhile the sweet odours, exhaled by plants and trees bathed in the\r\nmorning dew, reached their nostrils.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: Alonzo Perez Nirando, a sailor from Huelva, made the\r\njoyous announcement, and the sailors sang the _Salve Regina_ in\r\nthanksgiving. Columbus named the island _Trinidad_, having already\r\ndecided to dedicate the first sighted land to the Holy Trinity. The\r\nthree mountain peaks close together seemed to render the name all the\r\nmore appropriate.]\r\n\r\nTwenty miles from that place, the Admiral found a sufficiently large\r\nport to shelter his ships, though no river flowed into it. Sailing\r\nfarther on he finally discovered a satisfactory harbour for repairing\r\nhis vessels and also replenishing his supply of water and wood.\r\nHe called this land Punta del Arenal.[4] There was no sign of any\r\nhabitation in the neighbourhood of the harbour, but there were many\r\ntracks of animals similar to goats, and in fact the body of one of\r\nthose animals, closely resembling a goat, was found. On the morrow, a\r\ncanoe was seen in the distance carrying eighty men, all of whom were\r\nyoung, good-looking, and of lofty stature. Besides their bows and\r\narrows they were armed with shields, which is not the custom among the\r\nother islanders. They wore their hair long, parted in the middle,\r\nand plastered down quite in the Spanish fashion. Save for their\r\nloin-cloths of various coloured cottons, they were entirely naked.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: The narrative at this point is somewhat sketchy, but\r\nthe author, doubtless, faithfully recounted the events as they were\r\nreported to him. The ships approached the island from the east, and\r\nthen coasted its shore for five leagues beyond the cape named by\r\nColumbus _La Galera_, because of it's imagined resemblance to a galley\r\nunder sail. The next day he continued his course westwards, and named\r\nanother headland _Punta de la Playa_; this was a Wednesday, August the\r\nfirst; and as the fleet passed between La Galera and La Playa, the\r\nSouth American continent was first discovered, some twenty-five\r\nleagues distant. Fernando Columbus affirms that his father, thinking\r\nit was another island, called it _Isla Santa_; but in reality Columbus\r\nnamed the continent _Tierra de Gracia_. Punta del Arenal forms the\r\nsouth-western extremity of the island and is separated by a channel,\r\naccording to Columbus, two leagues broad.]\r\n\r\nThe Admiral's opinion was that this country was nearer to the sky than\r\nany other land situated in the same parallel and that it was above the\r\nthick vapours which rose from the valleys and swamps, just as the high\r\npeaks of lofty mountains are distant from the deep valleys. Although\r\nColumbus declared that during this voyage he had followed without\r\ndeviation the parallel of Ethiopia, there are the greatest possible\r\nphysical differences between the natives of Ethiopia and those of the\r\nislands; for the Ethiopians are black and have curly, woolly hair,\r\nwhile these natives are on the contrary white, and have long,\r\nstraight, blond hair. What the causes of these differences may be, I\r\ndo not know. They are due rather to the conditions of the earth than\r\nto those of the sky; for we know perfectly well that snow falls and\r\nlies on the mountains of the torrid zone, while in northern countries\r\nfar distant from that zone the inhabitants are overcome by great heat.\r\n\r\nIn order to attract the natives they had met, the Admiral made them\r\nsome presents of mirrors, cups of bright polished brass, bells, and\r\nother similar trifles, but the more he called to them, the more\r\nthey drew off. Nevertheless, they looked intently and with sincere\r\nadmiration at our men, their instruments and their ships, but without\r\nlaying down their oars. Seeing that he could not attract them by his\r\npresents, the Admiral ordered his trumpets and flutes to be played,\r\non the largest ship, and the men to dance and sing a chorus. He hoped\r\nthat the sweetness of the songs and the strange sounds might win them\r\nover, but the young men imagined that the Spaniards were singing\r\npreparatory to engaging in battle, so in the twinkling of an eye they\r\ndropped their oars and seized their bows and arrows, protecting their\r\narms with their shields, and, while waiting to understand the meaning\r\nof the sounds, stood ready to let fly a volley against our men. The\r\nSpaniards sought to draw near little by little, in such wise as to\r\nsurround them; but the natives retreated from the Admiral's vessel\r\nand, confident in their ability as oarsmen, they approached so near to\r\none of the smaller ships that from the poop a cloak was given to the\r\npilot of the canoe, and a cap to another chief. They made signs to the\r\ncaptain of the ship to come to land, in order that they might the more\r\neasily come to an understanding; but when they saw that the captain\r\ndrew near to the Admiral's vessel to ask permission to land, they\r\nfeared some trap, and quickly jumped into their canoe and sped away\r\nwith the rapidity of the wind.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral relates that to the west of that island and not far\r\ndistant he came upon a strong current flowing from east to west.[5] It\r\nran with such force that he compared its violence to that of a vast\r\ncataract flowing from a mountain height. He declared that he had never\r\nbeen exposed to such serious danger since he began, as a boy, to sail\r\nthe seas. Advancing as best he could amongst these raging waves,\r\nhe discovered a strait some eight miles long, which resembled the\r\nentrance of a large harbour. The current flowed towards that strait,\r\nwhich he called Boca de la Sierpe, naming an island beside it,\r\nMargarita. From this strait there flowed another current of fresh\r\nwater, thus coming into conflict with the salt waters and causing such\r\nwaves that there seemed to rage between the two currents a terrible\r\ncombat. In spite of these difficulties, the Admiral succeeded in\r\npenetrating into the gulf, where he found the waters drinkable and\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: Columbus was then near the mouth of the Orinoco River.]\r\n\r\nAnother very singular thing the Admiral has told me, and which is\r\nconfirmed by his companions (all worthy of credence and whom I\r\ncarefully questioned concerning the details of the voyage), is that he\r\nsailed twenty-six leagues, that is to say, one hundred and forty-eight\r\nmiles, in fresh water; and the farther he advanced to the west,\r\nthe fresher the water became.[6] Finally, he sighted a very lofty\r\nmountain, of which the eastern part was inhabited only by a multitude\r\nof monkeys with very long tails. All this side of the mountain is\r\nvery steep, which explains why no people live there. A man, sent to\r\nreconnoitre the country, reported however that it was all cultivated\r\nand that the fields were sown, though nowhere were there people or\r\nhuts. Our own peasants often go some distance from their homes to sow\r\ntheir fields. On the western side of the mountain was a large plain.\r\nThe Spaniards were well satisfied to drop anchor in such a great\r\nriver.[7] As soon as the natives knew of the landing of an unknown\r\nrace on their coasts, they collected about the Spaniards anxious to\r\nexamine them, and displaying not the slightest fear. It was learned by\r\nsigns that that country was called Paria, that it was very extensive,\r\nand that its population was most numerous in its western part. The\r\nAdmiral invited four natives to come on board and continued his course\r\nto the west.\r\n\r\n[Note 6: See _Orinoco Illustrado_, by Gumilla, 1754, also\r\nSchomburgk's _Reisen in Guiana und Orinoco_. The fresh waters of the\r\nestuary are in fact driven a considerable distance out to sea.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7: This was the first landing of the Spaniards on the\r\nAmerican continent, but Columbus, being ill, did not go on shore.\r\nPedro de Torreros took possession in the Admiral's name (Navarrete,\r\ntom. iii., p. 569). Fernando Columbus states that his father suffered\r\nfrom inflamed eyes, and that from about this time he was forced to\r\nrely for information upon his sailors and pilots (_Storia_, cap.\r\nlxv.-lxxiii.). He seemed nevertheless to divine the immensity of the\r\nnewly discovered land, for he wrote to the sovereigns _y creo\r\nesta tierra que agora, mandaron discrubir vuestras altezzas sea\r\ngrandissima_.]\r\n\r\nJudging by the agreeable temperature, the attractiveness of the\r\ncountry, and the number of people they daily saw during their voyage,\r\nthe Spaniards concluded that the country is a very important one, and\r\nin this opinion they were not wrong, as we shall demonstrate at the\r\nproper time. One morning at the break of dawn the Spaniards landed,\r\nbeing attracted by the charm of the country and the sweet odours\r\nwafted to them from the forests. They discovered at that point a\r\nlarger number of people than they had thus far seen, and as they were\r\napproaching the shore, messengers came in the name of the caciques\r\nof that country, inviting them to land and to have no fears. When\r\nColumbus refused, the natives urged by curiosity, flocked about the\r\nships in their barques. Most of them wore about their necks and arms,\r\ncollars and bracelets of gold and ornaments of Indian pearls, which\r\nseemed just as common amongst them as glass jewelry amongst our\r\nwomen. When questioned as to whence came the pearls, they answered by\r\npointing with their fingers to a neighbouring coast; by grimaces and\r\ngestures they seemed to indicate that if the Spaniards would stop with\r\nthem they would give them basketfuls of pearls. The provisions which\r\nthe Admiral destined for the colony at Hispaniola were beginning to\r\nspoil, so he resolved to defer this commercial operation till a more\r\nconvenient opportunity. Nevertheless he despatched two boats loaded\r\nwith soldiers, to barter with the people on land for some strings of\r\npearls and, at the same time, to discover whatever they could about\r\nthe place and its people. The natives received these men with\r\nenthusiasm and pleasure, and great numbers surrounded them, as though\r\nthey were inspecting something marvellous. The first who came forward\r\nwere two distinguished persons, for they were followed by the rest of\r\nthe crowd. The first of these men was aged and the second younger,\r\nso that it was supposed they were the father and his son and future\r\nsuccessor. After exchanging salutations the Spaniards were conducted\r\nto a round house near a large square. Numerous seats of very black\r\nwood decorated with astonishing skill were brought, and when the\r\nprincipal Spaniards and natives were seated, some attendants served\r\nfood and others, drink. These people eat only fruits, of which they\r\nhave a great variety, and very different from ours. The beverages they\r\noffered were white and red wine, not made from grapes but from various\r\nkinds of crushed fruits, which were not at all disagreeable.\r\n\r\nThis repast concluded, in company with the elder chief, the younger\r\none conducted the Spaniards to his own house, men and women crowding\r\nabout in great numbers, but always in separate groups from one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe natives of both sexes have bodies as white as ours, save those\r\nperhaps who pass their time in the sun. They were amiable, hospitable,\r\nand wore no clothes, save waist-cloths of various coloured cotton\r\nstuffs. All of them wore either collars or bracelets of gold or\r\npearls, and some wore both, just as our peasants wear glass jewelry.\r\nWhen they were asked whence the gold came, they indicated with the\r\nfinger that it was from a mountainous country, appearing at the\r\nsame time to dissuade our men from going there, for they made them\r\nunderstand by gestures and signs that the inhabitants of that country\r\nwere cannibals. It was not, however, entirely clear whether they meant\r\ncannibals or savage beasts. They were much vexed to perceive that the\r\nSpaniards did not understand them, and that they possessed no means of\r\nmaking themselves intelligible to one another. At three o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon the men who had been sent on shore returned, bringing\r\nseveral strings of pearls, and the Admiral, who could not prolong his\r\nstay, because of his cargo of provisions, raised anchor and sailed. He\r\nintends, however, after putting the affairs of Hispaniola in order,\r\nshortly to return. It was another than he who profited by this\r\nimportant discovery.\r\n\r\nThe shallowness of the sea and the numerous currents, which at each\r\nchange of the tide dashed against and injured the lesser vessels,\r\nmuch retarded the Admiral's progress, and to avoid the perils of the\r\nshallows he always sent one of the lighter caravels ahead; this vessel\r\nbeing of short draught took repeated soundings and the other larger\r\nones followed. At that time two provinces of the vast region of Paria,\r\nCumaná and Manacapana, were reached, and along their shores the\r\nAdmiral coasted for two hundred miles. Sixty leagues farther on begins\r\nanother country called Curiana. As the Admiral had already covered\r\nsuch a distance, he thought the land lying ahead of him was an island,\r\nand that if he continued his course to the west he would be unable to\r\nget back to the north and reach Hispaniola. It was then that he came\r\nupon the mouth of a river whose depth was thirty cubits, with an\r\nunheard-of width which he described as twenty-eight leagues. A little\r\nfarther on, always in a westerly direction though somewhat to the\r\nsouth, since he followed the line of the coast, the Admiral sailed\r\ninto a sea of grass of which the seeds resemble those of the lentil.\r\nThe density of this growth retarded the advance of the ships.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral declares that in the whole of that region the day\r\nconstantly equals the night. The north star is elevated as in Paria\r\nto five degrees above the horizon, and all the coasts of that newly\r\ndiscovered country are on the same parallel. He likewise reports\r\ndetails concerning the differences he observed in the heavens, which\r\nare so contradictory to astronomical theories that I wish to make some\r\ncomments. It is proven, Most Illustrious Prince, that the polar star,\r\nwhich our sailors call Tramontane, is not the point of the arctic pole\r\nupon which the axis of the heavens turns. To realise this easily,\r\nit is only necessary to look through a small hole at the pole star\r\nitself, when the stars are rising. If one then looks through the same\r\naperture at the same star when dawn is paling the stars, it will be\r\nseen that it has changed its place; but how can it be in this newly\r\ndiscovered country that the star rises at the beginning of twilight in\r\nthe month of June to a height of only five degrees above the horizon,\r\nand when the stars are disappearing before the sunrise, it should be\r\nfound by the same observer to be in the fifteenth degree? I do not at\r\nall understand it, and I must confess the reasons the Admiral gives\r\nby no means satisfy me. Indeed, according to his conjectures, the\r\nterrestrial globe is not an absolute sphere, but had at the time of\r\nits creation a sort of elevation rising on its convex side, so that\r\ninstead of resembling a ball or an apple, it was more like a pear, and\r\nParia would be precisely that elevated part, nearest to the sky.\r\nHe has also persisted in affirming that the earthly paradise[8] is\r\nsituated on the summit of those three mountains, which the watcher\r\nfrom the height of the crow's nest observed in the distance, as I have\r\nrecounted. As for the impetuous current of fresh water which rushed\r\nagainst the tide of the sea at the beginning of that strait, he\r\nmaintains that it is formed of waters which fall in cascades from the\r\nheights of these mountains. But we have had enough of these things\r\nwhich to me seem fabulous. Let us return to our narrative.\r\n\r\n[Note 8: Speaking of the earthly paradise, Columbus describes it\r\nas _adonde ne puede llegar nadie, sabro par voluntad divina_. Vespucci\r\nit was who thought it would be found in the New World; _se nel mondo e\r\nalcun paradiso terrestre_.]\r\n\r\nSeeing his course across that vast gulf had, contrary to his\r\nexpectation, been arrested, and fearing to find no exit towards the\r\nnorth through which he might reach Hispaniola, the Admiral retraced\r\nhis course and sailing north of that country he bent towards the east\r\nin the direction of Hispaniola.\r\n\r\nThose navigators who later explored this region more carefully believe\r\nthat it is the Indian continent, and not Cuba, as the Admiral thought;\r\nand there are not wanting mariners who pretend that they have sailed\r\nall round Cuba. Whether they are right or whether they seek to gratify\r\ntheir jealousy of the author of a great discovery, I am not bound to\r\ndecide.[9] Time will decide, and Time is the only truthful judge. The\r\nAdmiral likewise discusses the question whether or not Paria is\r\na continent; he himself thinks it is. Paria lies to the south of\r\nHispaniola, a distance of 882 leagues, according to Columbus. Upon the\r\nthird day of the calends of September of the year 1498, he reached\r\nHispaniola, most anxious to see again his soldiers and his brother\r\nwhom he had left there. But, as commonly happens in human affairs,\r\nfortune, however favourable, mingles with circumstances, sweet and\r\npleasant, some grain of bitterness. In this case it was internecine\r\ndiscord which marred his happiness.\r\n\r\n[Note 9: Rivalry and perhaps jealousy existed among the\r\nnavigators, each bent on eclipsing the achievements of his fellows,\r\nand the former feeling was a spur to enterprise. Yañez Pinzon, Amerigo\r\nVespucci, Juan Diaz de Solis all explored the American coasts,\r\ndiscovering Yucatan, Florida, Texas, and Honduras.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME CARDINAL LUDOVICO D'ARAGON\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival at Hispaniola, the Admiral found an even greater\r\nstate of disorder than he had feared, for Roldan had taken advantage\r\nof his absence to refuse obedience to his brother, Bartholomew\r\nColumbus. Resolved not to submit to him who had formerly been his\r\nmaster and had raised him in dignity, he had stirred up the multitude\r\nin his own favour and had also vilified the Adelantado and had written\r\nheinous accusations to the King against the brothers. The Admiral\r\nlikewise sent envoys to inform the sovereigns of the revolt, begging\r\nthem at the same time to send soldiers to put down the insurrection\r\nand punish the guilty, according to their crimes. Roldan and his\r\naccomplices preferred grave charges against the Admiral and the\r\nAdelantado, who, according to them, were impious, unjust men, enemies\r\nto the Spaniards, whose blood they had profusely shed. They were\r\naccused of torturing, strangling, decapitating and, in divers other\r\nways, killing people on the most trifling pretexts. They were envious,\r\nproud, and intolerable tyrants; therefore, people avoided them as they\r\nwould fly from wild beasts, or from the enemies of the Crown. It had\r\nin fact been discovered that the sole thought of the brothers was to\r\nusurp the government of the island. This had been proven by different\r\ncircumstances, but chiefly by the fact that they allowed none but\r\ntheir own partisans to work the gold-mines.\r\n\r\nIn soliciting reinforcements from the sovereigns, sufficient to deal\r\nwith the rebels according to their merits, the Admiral explained that\r\nthose men who dared thus to accuse him were guilty of misdemeanours\r\nand crimes; for they were debauchees, profligates, thieves, seducers,\r\nravishers, vagabonds. They respected nothing and were perjurers and\r\nliars, already condemned by the tribunals, or fearful, owing to their\r\nnumerous crimes, to appear before them. They had formed a faction\r\namongst themselves, given over to violence and rapine; lazy,\r\ngluttonous, caring only to sleep and to carouse. They spared nobody;\r\nand having been brought to the island of Hispaniola originally to do\r\nthe work of miners or of camp servants, they now never moved a step\r\nfrom their houses on foot, but insisted on being carried about the\r\nisland upon the shoulders of the unfortunate natives, as though they\r\nwere dignitaries of the State.[1] Not to lose practice in the shedding\r\nof blood, and to exercise the strength of their arms, they invented a\r\ngame in which they drew their swords, and amused themselves in\r\ncutting off the heads of innocent victims with one sole blow. Whoever\r\nsucceeded in more quickly landing the head of an unfortunate islander\r\non the ground with one stroke, was proclaimed the bravest, and as\r\nsuch was honoured.[2] Such were the mutual accusations bandied about\r\nbetween the Admiral and the partisans of Roldan, not to mention many\r\nother imputations.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: _Ab insularibus namque miseris pensiles per totam\r\ninsulam, tanquam ædiles curules, feruntur_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: See Las Casas, _Brevissima Relacion_, English\r\ntranslation, pub. by G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1909.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Admiral, desiring to put a stop to the dangerous attacks\r\nof the Ciguana tribe which had revolted under the leadership of\r\nGuarionex, sent his brother the Adelantado with ninety foot-soldiers\r\nand some horsemen against them. It may be truthfully added that about\r\nthree thousand of the islanders who had suffered from the invasions of\r\nthe Ciguana tribe, who were their sworn enemies, joined forces with\r\nthe Spaniards. The Adelantado led his troops to the bank of a great\r\nriver which waters the plain between the sea and the two extremes of\r\nthe mountain chain of Ciguana, of which we have already spoken.\r\nHe surprised two of the enemy's spies who were concealed in the\r\nunderbrush, one of whom sprang into the sea, and, swimming across the\r\nriver at its mouth, succeeded in escaping to his own people. From the\r\none who was captured, it was learned that six thousand natives of\r\nCiguana were hidden in the forest beyond the river and were prepared\r\nto attack the Spaniards when they crossed over. The Adelantado\r\ntherefore marched along the river bank seeking a ford. This he soon\r\nfound in the plain, and was preparing to cross the river when the\r\nCiguana warriors rushed out from the forest in compact battalions,\r\nyelling in a most horrible manner. Their appearance is fearsome and\r\nrepulsive, and they march into battle daubed with paint, as did the\r\nThracians and Agathyrses. These natives indeed paint themselves from\r\nthe forehead to the knees, with black and scarlet colours which they\r\nextract from certain fruits similar to pears, and which they carefully\r\ncultivate in their gardens. Their hair is tormented into a thousand\r\nstrange forms, for it is long and black, and what nature refuses\r\nthey supply by art. They look like goblins emerged from the infernal\r\ncaverns. Advancing towards our men who were trying to cross the river,\r\nthey contested their passage with flights of arrows and by throwing\r\npointed sticks; and such was the multitude of projectiles that they\r\nhalf darkened the light of the sun, and had not the Spaniards received\r\nthe blows on their shields the engagement would have ended badly for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA number of men were wounded in this first encounter, but the\r\nAdelantado succeeded in crossing the river and the enemy fled, the\r\nSpaniards pursuing them, though they killed few, as the islanders are\r\ngood runners. As soon as they gained the protection of the woods, they\r\nused their bows to repulse their pursuers, for they are accustomed to\r\nwoods, and run naked amongst underbrush, shrubs, and trees, like wild\r\nboars, heedless of obstacles. The Spaniards, on the contrary, were\r\nhindered amongst this undergrowth by their shields, their clothes,\r\ntheir long lances, and their ignorance of the surroundings. After a\r\nnight passed uselessly in the woods the Adelantado, realising the next\r\nmorning that they could catch nobody, followed the counsel of those\r\nislanders who are the immemorial enemies of the Ciguana tribe, and\r\nunder their guidance marched towards the mountains where the King\r\nMaiobanexius lived at a place called Capronus. Twelve miles' march\r\nbrought them to the village of another cacique, which had been\r\nabandoned by its terrified inhabitants, and there he established his\r\ncamp. Two natives were captured, from whom it was learned that King\r\nMaiobanexius and ten caciques with eight thousand soldiers were\r\nassembled at Capronus. During two days there were a few light\r\nskirmishes between the parties, the Adelantado not wishing to do more\r\nthan reconnoitre the country. Scouts were sent out the following night\r\nunder the guidance of some islanders who knew the land. The people of\r\nCiguana caught sight of our men from the heights of their mountains,\r\nand prepared to give battle, uttering war-cries as is their custom.\r\nBut they did not venture to quit their woods, because they thought the\r\nAdelantado had his entire army with him. Twice on the following day,\r\nwhen the Adelantado marched on with his men, the natives tested the\r\nfortune of war; hurling themselves against the Spaniards with fury,\r\nthey wounded many before they could protect themselves with their\r\nshields, but the latter, getting the better of them, pursued them,\r\ncutting some in pieces, and taking a large number prisoners. Those who\r\nescaped took refuge in the forests, from which they were careful not\r\nto emerge.\r\n\r\nThe Adelantado selected one of the prisoners, and sending with him\r\none of his allies, he despatched them both to Maiobanexius with the\r\nfollowing message: \"The Adelantado has not undertaken to make war upon\r\nyou and your people, O Maiobanexius, for he desires your friendship;\r\nbut he formally demands that Guarionex, who has taken refuge with\r\nyou and has drawn you into this conflict to the great damage of your\r\npeople, shall be delivered to him to be punished as he merits. He\r\ncounsels you, therefore, to give up this cacique; if you consent, the\r\nAdmiral will count you among his friends and protect and respect your\r\nterritory. If you refuse you will be made to repent, for your entire\r\ncountry will be devastated with fire and sword, and all you possess\r\nwill be destroyed.\" Maiobanexius, upon hearing this message, replied:\r\n\"Everybody knows that Guarionex is a hero, adorned with all the\r\nvirtues, and therefore I have esteemed it right to assist and protect\r\nhim. As for you, you are violent and perfidious men, and seek to shed\r\nthe blood of innocent people: I will neither enter into relations with\r\nyou, nor form any alliance with so false a people.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this answer was brought to the Adelantado, he burnt the\r\nvillage where he had established his camp and several others in the\r\nneighbourhood. He again sent envoys to Maiobanexius, to ask him to\r\nname one of his trusty advisers to treat for peace. Maiobanexius\r\nconsented to send one of the most devoted of his counsellors,\r\naccompanied by two other chiefs. The Adelantado earnestly conjured\r\nthem not to jeopardise the territory of Maiobanexius solely in the\r\ninterests of Guarionex. He advised Maiobanexius, if he did not wish to\r\nbe ruined himself and to be treated as an enemy, to give him up.\r\n\r\nWhen his envoys returned, Maiobanexius called together his people and\r\nexplained the conditions. The people cried that Guarionex must be\r\nsurrendered, cursing and execrating the day he had come amongst them\r\nto disturb their tranquillity. The cacique reminded them, however,\r\nthat Guarionex was a hero, and had rendered him services when he\r\nfled to him for protection, for he had brought him royal presents.\r\nMoreover, he had taught both the cacique himself and his wife to\r\nsing and dance, a thing not to be held in mediocre consideration.\r\nMaiobanexius was determined never to surrender the prince who had\r\nappealed to his protection, and whom he had promised to defend. He was\r\nprepared to risk the gravest perils with him rather than to merit the\r\nreproach of having betrayed his guest. Despite the complaints of the\r\npeople, the cacique dissolved the assembly, and calling Guarionex to\r\nhim, he pledged himself for the second time to protect him and to\r\nshare his fortunes as long as he lived.\r\n\r\nMaiobanexius resolved to give no further information to the\r\nAdelantado: on the contrary he ordered his first messenger to station\r\nhimself with some faithful soldiers at a place on the road where the\r\nAdelantado's envoys usually passed, and to kill any Spaniards who\r\nappeared, without further discussion. The Adelantado had just sent\r\nhis messengers, and both these men, one of whom was a prisoner\r\nfrom Ciguana and the other from amongst the native allies, were\r\ndecapitated. The Adelantado, escorted by only ten foot-soldiers and\r\nfour horsemen, followed his envoys and discovered their bodies lying\r\nin the road, which so incensed him that he determined to no longer\r\nspare Maiobanexius. He invaded the cacique's village of Capronus with\r\nhis army. The caciques fled in every direction, abandoning their\r\nchief, who withdrew with his entire family into places of concealment\r\nin the mountain districts. Some others of the Ciguana people sought to\r\ncapture Guarionex, since he was the occasion of the catastrophe; but\r\nhe succeeded in escaping and concealed himself almost alone amidst\r\nthe rocks and desert mountains. The soldiers of the Adelantado were\r\nexhausted by this long war, which dragged on for three months; the\r\nwatches, the fatigues, and the scarcity of food. In response to their\r\nrequest they were authorised to return to Concepcion, where they owned\r\nhandsome plantations of the native sort; and thither many withdrew.\r\nOnly thirty companions remained with the Adelantado, all of whom were\r\nseverely tried by these three months of fighting, during which they\r\nhad eaten nothing but cazabi, that is to say, bread made of roots,\r\nand even they were not always ripe. They also procured some utias, or\r\nrabbits, by hunting with their dogs, while their only drink had been\r\nwater, which was sometimes exquisitely fresh, but just as often muddy\r\nand marshy. Moreover the character of the war obliged them to pass\r\nmost of the time in the open air and perpetual movement.\r\n\r\nWith his little troop the Adelantado determined to scour the mountains\r\nto seek out the secret retreats where Maiobanexius and Guarionex had\r\nconcealed themselves. Some Spaniards, who had been driven by hunger\r\nto hunt utias for want of something better, met two servants of\r\nMaiobanexius, whom the cacique had sent into the villages of his\r\nterritory, and who were carrying back native bread. They forced\r\nthese men to betray the hiding-place of their chief, and under their\r\nleadership, twelve soldiers who had stained their bodies like the\r\npeople of Ciguana succeeded by trickery in capturing Maiobanexius,\r\nhis wife, and his son, all of whom they brought to the Admiral at\r\nConcepcion. A few days later hunger compelled Guarionex to emerge from\r\nthe cavern where he was concealed, and the islanders, out of fear of\r\nthe Admiral, betrayed him to the hunters. As soon as he learned his\r\nwhereabouts, the Admiral sent a body of foot-soldiers to take him,\r\njust at the moment when he was about to quit the plain, and return to\r\nthe mountains. These men caught him and brought him back, after which\r\nthat region was pacified, and tranquillity restored.\r\n\r\nA relative of Maiobanexius who was married to a cacique whose\r\nterritory had not yet been invaded, shared the former's misfortunes.\r\nEverybody agreed in saying that she was the most beautiful of the\r\nwomen nature had created in the island of Hispaniola. Her husband\r\nloved her dearly, as she merited, and when she was captured by the\r\nSpaniards he almost lost his reason, and wandered distractedly in\r\ndesert places, doubtful what course to pursue. Finally he presented\r\nhimself before the Admiral, promising that he and his people would\r\nsubmit without conditions, if he would only restore him his wife.\r\nHis prayer was granted and at the same time several others of the\r\nprincipal captives were likewise freed. This same cacique then\r\nassembled five thousand natives who instead of weapons carried\r\nagricultural implements, and went himself to labour and plant the\r\ncrops in one of the largest valleys in his territories. The Admiral\r\nthanked him by means of presents, and the cacique came back rejoicing.\r\nThis news spread throughout Ciguana, and the other caciques began to\r\nhope that they too might be treated with clemency, so they came in\r\nperson to promise they would in future obey the orders given them.\r\nThey asked that their chief and his family might be spared, and in\r\nresponse to their petition, the wife and children were delivered to\r\nthem, but Maiobanexius was held a prisoner.\r\n\r\nWhile the Admiral was thus engaged in administering the affairs of\r\nHispaniola, he was ignorant of the intrigues his adversaries were\r\ncarrying on against him at the Spanish Court.[3] Wearied by these\r\ncontinuous quarrels, and above all annoyed at receiving but a small\r\nquantity of gold and valuable products because of these dissensions\r\nand revolts, the sovereigns, appointed another Governor,[4] who, after\r\na careful enquiry, should punish the guilty and send them back to\r\nSpain, I do not precisely know what has come to light against either\r\nthe Admiral or his brother the Adelantado, or their enemies; but this\r\nis certain, that the Admiral and his brother were seized, put in\r\nirons, deprived of all their property, and brought to Spain; and of\r\nthis, Most Illustrious Prince, you are not ignorant. It is true that\r\nthe sovereigns, when they learned that the Columbus brothers had\r\narrived at Cadiz loaded with irons, promptly sent their secretaries to\r\norder their release and that their children should be allowed to\r\nvisit them; nor did they conceal their disapproval of this rough\r\ntreatment.[5] It is claimed that the new Governor has sent to the\r\nsovereigns some letters in the handwriting of the Admiral, but in\r\ncipher, in which the latter summoned his brother the Adelantado, who\r\nwas at that time absent with his soldiers, to hasten back and repel\r\nforce with force, in case the Governor sought to use violence. The\r\nAdelantado preceded his soldiers, and the Governor seized him and his\r\nbrother before their partisans could rejoin them. What will be the\r\noutcome, time will show, for time is the supreme arbiter of events.\r\nFare you well.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: One of the most inveterate of his enemies was Juan de\r\nFonseca, afterwards Bishop of Burgos, who was unfortunately in a\r\nposition to do Columbus serious harm.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Francisco de Bobadilla, commander of Calatrava.]\r\n\r\n[Note 5: The sovereigns made what amends they could for the\r\nabusive execution of their orders by over-zealous agents; they sent\r\nColumbus a present of two thousand ducats--not an insignificant sum at\r\nthe time--and wrote him a letter, full of affectionate expressions of\r\nconfidence; he was admitted to audience on December 17th.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME CARDINAL LUDOVICO D'ARAGON\r\n\r\n\r\nI have presented to you this immense and hitherto unknown ocean which\r\nthe Admiral, Christopher Columbus, discovered, under the auspices of\r\nour sovereigns, in the guise of a necklace of gold, although, owing to\r\nthe poor skill of the artisan, it is but poorly executed. Yet I have\r\njudged it worthy, Most Illustrious Prince, of your splendour. Accept\r\nnow a necklace of pearls which, suspended from the former, will\r\nornament your breast.\r\n\r\nSome of the Admiral's ship-captains who had made a study of the\r\ndifferent wind-currents sought the royal permission to prosecute\r\ndiscoveries at their own expense,[1] proposing to relinquish to the\r\nCrown its due, that is to say, one fifth of the profits. The most\r\nfortunate of these adventurers was a certain Pedro Alonzo Nuñez,[2]\r\nwho sailed towards the south; and it is of his expedition that I will\r\nfirst write. To come at once to the essential details of this voyage,\r\nthis Nuñez had but one ship, fitted out at his expense, though some\r\npeople claimed that he was helped.[3] The royal edict forbade him to\r\nanchor within fifty leagues of any place discovered by the Admiral.\r\nHe sailed towards Paria, where, as I have said, Columbus found both\r\nnative men and women wearing bracelets and necklaces of pearls. In\r\nobedience to the royal decree he coasted along this shore, leaving\r\nbehind him the provinces of Cumana and Manacapana, and thus arrived\r\nat a country called by its inhabitants Curiana, where he discovered a\r\nharbour quite similar to that of Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: See Navarrete, tom, ii., 1867; Gomara, _Historia\r\nGeneral_, p. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Also called Niño; he had sailed with Columbus on his\r\nfirst two voyages. Oviedo, _op. cit_., xix., I, also describes this\r\nexpedition.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3: Nuñez was poor and only found assistance from a merchant\r\nof Seville called Guerro, on condition that the latter's brother,\r\nChristobal, should command the one ship his loan sufficed to provide.\r\nThis vessel was only fifty tons burden, and carried a crew of\r\nthirty-three persons.]\r\n\r\nUpon entering this harbour he found a number of houses scattered along\r\nthe banks, but when he landed it was discovered to be a group of eight\r\nhouses; about fifty men, led by their chief, promptly came from a\r\npopulous village only three miles distant. These men, who were naked,\r\ninvited Alonzo Nuñez to land on their coast, and he consented. He\r\ndistributed some needles, bracelets, rings, glass pearls, and other\r\npedlar's trifles amongst them, and in less than an hour he obtained\r\nfrom them in exchange fifteen ounces of the pearls they wore on their\r\nnecks and arms. The natives embraced Nuñez affectionately, insisting\r\nmore and more that he should come to their village, where they\r\npromised to give him any amount of pearls he might desire. The next\r\nday at dawn the ship drew near to the village and anchored. The entire\r\npopulation assembled and begged the men to land, but Nuñez, seeing\r\nthat they were very numerous and considering that he had only thirty\r\nmen, did not venture to trust himself to them. He made them understand\r\nby signs and gestures that they should come to the ship in barques\r\nand canoes. These barques, like the others, are dug out of a single\r\ntree-trunk, but are less well shaped and less easy to handle than\r\nthose used by the cannibals and the natives of Hispaniola. They are\r\ncalled _gallitas_. The natives all brought strings of pearls, which\r\nare called _tenoras_, and showed themselves desirous of Spanish\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\nThey are amiable men; simple, innocent, and hospitable, as was made\r\nclear after twenty days of intercourse with them. The Spaniards very\r\nsoon ceased to fear to enter their houses, which are built of wood\r\ncovered with palm leaves. Their principal food is the meat of the\r\nshellfish from which they extract pearls, and their shores abound\r\nwith such. They likewise eat the flesh of wild animals, for deer,\r\nwild-boar, rabbits whose hair and colour resemble our hares, doves,\r\nand turtle-doves exist in their country. The women keep ducks and\r\ngeese about the houses, just as ours do; peacocks fly about in the\r\nwoods, but their colours are not so rich or so varied as ours and the\r\nmale bird differs little from the female. Amongst the undergrowth\r\nin the swamps, pheasants are from time to time seen. The people of\r\nCuriana are skilful hunters and generally with one single arrow shot\r\nthey kill beasts or birds at which they aim. The Spaniards spent\r\nseveral days amongst the abundance of the country. They traded four\r\nneedles for a peacock, only two for a pheasant, and one for a dove or\r\na turtle-dove. The same, or a glass bead, was given for a goose.\r\nIn making their offers and bargaining and disputing, the natives\r\nconducted their commercial affairs just about the same as do our women\r\nwhen they are arguing with pedlars. As they wore no clothes, the\r\nnatives were puzzled to know the use of needles, but when the\r\nSpaniards satisfied their naive curiosity by showing them that needles\r\nwere useful for getting thorns from beneath the skin, and for cleaning\r\nthe teeth, they conceived a great opinion of them. Another thing which\r\npleased them even more was the colour and sound of hawk-bells, which\r\nthey were ready to buy at good prices.\r\n\r\nFrom the native houses the roaring of large animals[4] was audible\r\namidst the dense and lofty forest trees, but these animals are not\r\nfierce, for, although the natives constantly wander through the\r\nwoods with no other weapons than their bows and arrows, there is no\r\nrecollection of any one being killed by these beasts. They brought the\r\nSpaniards as many deer and wild-boar, slain with their arrows, as the\r\nlatter desired. They did not possess cattle or goats or sheep, and\r\nthey ate bread made of roots and bread made of grain the same as the\r\nislanders of Hispaniola. Their hair is black, thick, half curly, and\r\nlong. They try to spoil the whiteness of their teeth, for almost the\r\nentire day they chew a herb which blackens them, and when they spit it\r\nout, they wash their mouth. It is the women who labour in the fields\r\nrather than the men, the latter spending their time in hunting,\r\nfighting, or leading dances and games.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Supposed to have been tapirs, animals unknown in Europe.]\r\n\r\nPitchers, cups with handles, and pots are their earthenware utensils,\r\nwhich they procure from elsewhere, for they frequently hold markets,\r\nwhich all the neighbouring tribes attend, each bringing the products\r\nof his country to be exchanged for those of other places. In fact,\r\nthere is nobody who is not delighted to obtain what is not to be had\r\nat home, because the love of novelty is an essential sentiment\r\nof human nature. They hang little birds and other small animals,\r\nartistically worked in base gold,[5] to their pearls. These trinkets\r\nthey obtain by trade, and the metal resembles the German gold used for\r\ncoining florins.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: A kind of alloyed gold called by the natives _guanin_;\r\nthe Spaniards were often deceived by its glitter.]\r\n\r\nThe men either carry their private parts enclosed in a little gourd\r\nwhich has been opened at the back, like our cod-piece, or they use a\r\nseashell. The gourd hangs from a cord tied round the waist.[6] The\r\npresence of the animals above mentioned, and many other indications\r\nnot found in any of the islands, afford evidence that this land is a\r\ncontinent. The most conclusive proof[7] seems to be that the Spaniards\r\nfollowed the coast of Paria for a distance of about three thousand\r\nmiles always in a westerly direction, but without discovering any\r\nend to it. When asked whence they procured their gold, the people of\r\nCuriana answered that it came from a country called Cauchieta situated\r\nabout six suns distant (which means six days) to the west, and that it\r\nwas the artisans of that region who worked the gold into the form in\r\nwhich they saw it. The Spaniards sailed towards Cauchieta and anchored\r\nthere near the shore on the calends of November, 1500. The natives\r\nfearlessly approached and brought them gold, which in its rough state\r\nis not valued amongst them. The people also wore pearls round their\r\nthroats; but these came from Curiana, where they had been obtained in\r\nexchange for gold, and none of them wanted to part with anything they\r\nhad obtained by trade. That is to say the people of Curiana kept their\r\ngold, and the people of Cauchieta their pearls, so that very little\r\ngold was obtained at Cauchieta.[8] The Spaniards brought away some\r\nvery pretty monkeys and a number of parrots of varied colours, from\r\nthat country.\r\n\r\n[Note 6: The text continues: _alibi in eo tractu intra vaginam\r\nmentularemque nervum reducunt, funiculoque præputium alligant_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7: Navarrete, iii., 14.]\r\n\r\n[Note 8: _Auri tamen parum apud Cauchietenses: lectum reperere_\r\nmeaning, doubtless, that they traded away most of their gold for\r\npearls.]\r\n\r\nThe temperature in the month of November was delicious, without a sign\r\nof cold. Each evening the stars which mark the north pole disappeared,\r\nso near is that region to the equator; but it was not possible to\r\ncalculate precisely the polar degrees. The natives are sensible and\r\nnot suspicious, and some of the people of Curiana passed the entire\r\nnight in company with our men, coming out in their barques to join\r\nthem. Pearls they call _corixas_. They are jealous, and when strangers\r\nvisit them, they make their women withdraw behind the house, from\r\nwhence the latter examine the guests as though they were prodigies.\r\nCotton is plentiful and grows wild in Cauchieta, just as shrubs do in\r\nour forests, and of this they make trousers which they wear.\r\n\r\nContinuing their course along the same coast, the Spaniards suddenly\r\nencountered about two thousand men armed according to the fashion of\r\nthe country, who prevented them from landing. They were so barbarous\r\nand ferocious that it was impossible to establish the smallest\r\nrelations with them or to effect any trade; so, as our men were\r\nsatisfied with the pearls they had procured, they returned by the\r\nsame course to Curiana, where they remained for another twenty days\r\nbountifully supplied with provisions.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me neither out of place nor useless to this history, to\r\nhere narrate what happened when they arrived within sight of the\r\ncoasts of Paria. They encountered by chance a squadron of eighteen\r\ncanoes full of cannibals engaged in a man-hunt: this was near the Boca\r\nde la Sierpe and the strait leading to the gulf of Paria, which I have\r\nbefore described. The cannibals unconcernedly approached the ship,\r\nsurrounding it, and shooting flights of arrows and javelins at our\r\nmen. The Spaniards replied by a cannon shot, which promptly scattered\r\nthem. In pursuing them, the ship's boat came up with one of their\r\ncanoes, but was able to capture only a single cannibal and a bound\r\nprisoner, the others having all escaped by swimming. This prisoner\r\nburst into tears, and by his gestures and rolling his eyes, gave it\r\nto be understood that six of his companions had been cruelly\r\ndisembowelled, cut into pieces, and devoured by those monsters, and\r\nthat the same fate awaited him on the morrow. They made him a present\r\nof the cannibal, upon whom he immediately threw himself, gnashing his\r\nteeth and belabouring him with blows of a stick and his fists and with\r\nkicks, for he believed that the death of his companions would not be\r\nsufficiently avenged till he beheld the cannibal insensible and beaten\r\nblack and blue. When questioned as to the customs and usages of the\r\ncannibals when they made expeditions to other countries, he said\r\nthey always carried with them, wherever they went, sticks prepared\r\nbeforehand which they planted in the ground at the place of their\r\nencampment, and beneath whose shelter they passed the night.\r\n\r\nHanging over the door of one of the chieftains in Curiana, the\r\nSpaniards found the head of a cannibal, which was regarded as a sort\r\nof standard or helmet captured from the enemy, and constituted a great\r\nhonour for this chief.\r\n\r\nThere is a district on the coast of Paria, called Haraia, which is\r\nremarkable for a peculiar kind of salt found there. It is a vast plain\r\nover which the waves of the sea are driven in heavy weather and\r\nwhen the waves subside and the sun comes out, the pools of water\r\ncrystallise into masses of the whitest salt, in sufficient quantity\r\nfor the natives to load all the ships that sail, did they arrive\r\nbefore it rained. The first rainfall melts the salt, which is then\r\nabsorbed by the sands and thus returns through fissures in the earth,\r\nto the sea which produces it. Others pretend that this plain is not\r\ninundated by the sea, but that it possesses saline springs, more\r\nbitter than sea water, which send forth their waters when the tempest\r\nrages. The natives set great store on these salines, and they not\r\nonly use the salt in the same way that we do, but they mould it into\r\nbrick-shaped forms and trade it to foreigners for articles which they\r\ndo not themselves possess.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the chiefs of the country are laid upon biers under\r\nwhich a slow fire is lighted which consumes the flesh, little by\r\nlittle, but leaves the bones and the skin intact. These dried bodies\r\nare then piously preserved, as though they were their _penates_. The\r\nSpaniards say that in one district they saw a man being thus dried for\r\npreservation and in another a woman.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the eighth day of the ides of February, the Spaniards were\r\nready to leave the country of Curiana, they found they had ninety-six\r\npounds of pearls at eight ounces to the pound, which they had obtained\r\nat an average price of five cents.\r\n\r\nAlthough their return voyage was shorter than when they came from\r\nHispaniola, it lasted sixty-one days, because continual currents\r\nrunning from east to west not only retarded their speed, but sometimes\r\ncompletely stopped the ship. Finally they arrived, loaded with pearls\r\nlike other people come loaded with straw. The commander, Pedro Alonzo\r\nNuñez, concealed an important quantity of valuable pearls, and thus\r\ncheated the royal revenues, to which a fifth of all merchandise\r\nbelongs.[9] His fellows denounced him, and Fernando de Vega, a learned\r\nstatesman, who was Governor of Galicia where they landed, arrested\r\nhim, and he was held in prison for a long time, but was finally\r\nreleased; and even to this day he still claims they robbed him of his\r\nshare of the pearls. Many of these stones are as large as nuts, and\r\nresemble oriental pearls, but as they are badly pierced, they are less\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\n[Note 9: Navarrete, iii., 78. The treasure was sold in August,\r\n1501, and the proceeds divided among the sailors.]\r\n\r\nOne day, when lunching with the illustrious Duke of Medina-Sidonia in\r\nSeville, I saw one of these pearls which had been presented to him. It\r\nweighed more than a hundred ounces, and I was charmed by its beauty\r\nand brilliancy. Some people claim that Nuñez did not find these pearls\r\nat Curiana, which is more than one hundred and twenty leagues distant\r\nfrom Boca de la Sierpe, but in the little districts of Cumana and\r\nManacapana near by the Boca and the island of Margarita. They declare\r\nthat Curiana is not rich in pearls. This question has not been\r\ndecided; so let us treat of another subject. You now perceive what, in\r\nthe course of years, may be the value of this newly discovered country\r\nand western coasts, since after a superficial exploration they have\r\nyielded such evidences of wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME CARDINAL LUDOVICO D'ARAGON\r\n\r\n\r\nVincent Yañez Pinzon and his nephew Arias, who accompanied the Admiral\r\nColumbus on his first voyage as captains of two of the smaller vessels\r\nwhich I have above described as caravels, desirous of undertaking new\r\nexpeditions and making fresh discoveries, built at their own expense\r\nfour caravels in their native port of Palos, as it is called by the\r\nSpaniards.[1] They sought the authorisation of the King and towards\r\nthe calends of December, 1499, they left port. Now Palos is on the\r\nwestern coast of Spain, situated about seventy-two miles distant from\r\nCadiz and sixty-four miles from Seville in Andalusia, and all the\r\ninhabitants without exception are seafaring people, exclusively\r\noccupied in navigation.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: An interesting account of this expedition may be read in\r\nWashington Irving's _Companions of Columbus_; see also Navarrete, _op.\r\ncit_., 82, 102, 113.]\r\n\r\nPinzon coasted along the Fortunate Isles,[2] and first laid his course\r\nfor the Hesperides, otherwise called the islands of Cape Verde, or\r\nstill better, the Medusian Gorgons. Sailing directly south on the\r\nides of January, from that island of the Hesperides called by the\r\nPortuguese San Juan, they sailed before the south-west wind for about\r\nthree hundred leagues, after which they lost sight of the north star.\r\nAs soon as it disappeared they were caught in winds and currents\r\nand continual tempests, though in spite of these great dangers they\r\naccomplished by the aid of this wind two hundred and forty leagues.\r\nThe north star was no longer to be seen. They are in contradiction\r\nwith the ancient poets, philosophers, and cosmographers over the\r\nquestion whether that portion of the world on the equinoctial line\r\nis or is not an inaccessible desert. The Spaniards affirm that it is\r\ninhabited by numerous peoples,[3] while the ancient writers maintain\r\nthat it is uninhabitable because of the perpendicular rays of the sun.\r\nI must admit, however, that even amongst ancient authorities some have\r\nbeen found who sought to maintain that that part of the world was\r\nhabitable.[4] When I asked the sailors of the Pinzons if they had seen\r\nthe polar star to the south, they said that they had seen no star\r\nresembling the polar star of our hemisphere, but they did see entirely\r\ndifferent stars,[5] and hanging on the higher horizon a thick sort of\r\nvapour which shut off the view. They believe that the middle part\r\nof the globe rises to a ridge,[6] and that the antarctic star is\r\nperceptible after that elevation is passed. At all events they have\r\nseen constellations entirely different from those of our hemisphere.\r\nSuch is their story, which I give you as they told it. _Davi sunt, non\r\nOedipi_.[7]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Meaning the Canaries in which the ancients placed the\r\nGarden of the Hesperides. From them Ptolemy began to reckon longitude.\r\nThe names Hesperia, Hesperides, Hesperus, etc., were used to indicate\r\nthe west; thus Italy is spoken of by Macrobius: _illi nam scilicet\r\nGræci a stella Hespero dicunt Venus et Hesperia Italia quæ occasui\r\nsit_; Saturnalium, lib. i., cap. iii. Ptolemy likewise says: _Italia\r\nHesperia ab Hespero Stella quod illius occasui subjecta sit_, and\r\nagain in his _Historia tripartita_, lib. viii: _Quum Valentinianus\r\nImperator as oras Hesperias navigaret, id est ad Italiam, et\r\nHispaniam_. Elsewhere the same author mentions the islands off the\r\nwest coast of Africa, of which he received some vague information as:\r\n_Incognitam terram qui communi vocabulo Hesperi appellantur Ethiopes_.\r\nPliny, Strabo, in the last chapter _De Situ Orbis_, Diodorus, and\r\nothers make similar usage of the terms. St. Anselm, _De Imagine\r\nMundi_, lib. i., cap. xx., _Juxta has, scilicet Gorgonas Hesperidum\r\nortus_; Pomponius Mela, lib. iii. cap. ix., x., xi.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3: The sub-equatorial regions of Africa had already been\r\nvisited by numerous navigators since the time of Prince Henry of\r\nPortugal, and the fact that they were inhabited was well known to the\r\nSpaniards.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Plato, Cicero, Aristotle, Anaxagoras, Mela, and others\r\nwere amongst those who believed in the existence of the Antipodes.]\r\n\r\n[Note 5: Aristotle, _De Cælo et Terra_, ii., 14. The constellation\r\nof the Southern Cross was known from the writings of the Arab\r\ngeographers.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6: First noted by Columbus in a letter written from\r\nHispaniola in October, 1498.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7: _Davus sum non Oedipus_, Andria, Act I, Scene II. The\r\nquotation, transposed by Martyr from the singular into the plural\r\nnumber, is from Terrence, Davus being a comic character in the comedy\r\nof _Andria_.]\r\n\r\nOn the seventh day of the calends of February, land was finally\r\ndiscovered on the horizon.[8] As the sea was troubled, soundings were\r\ntaken and the bottom found at sixteen fathoms. Approaching the coast\r\nthey landed at a place where they remained two entire days without\r\nseeing a single inhabitant, though some traces of human beings were\r\nfound on the banks. After writing their names and the name of the\r\nKing, with some details of their landing, on the trees and rocks, the\r\nSpaniards departed. Guiding themselves by some fires they saw during\r\nthe night, they encountered not far from their first landing-place\r\na tribe encamped and sleeping in the open air. They decided not to\r\ndisturb them until daybreak and when the sun rose forty men, carrying\r\narms, marched towards the natives. Upon seeing them, thirty-two\r\nsavages, armed with bows and javelins, advanced, followed by the rest\r\nof the troop armed in like manner. Our men relate that these natives\r\nwere larger than Germans or Hungarians. With frowning eyes and\r\nmenacing looks they scanned our compatriots, who thought it unwise to\r\nuse their arms against them. Whether they acted thus out of fear or to\r\nprevent them running away, I am ignorant, but at any rate, they sought\r\nto attract the natives by gentle words and by offering them presents;\r\nbut the natives showed themselves determined to have no relation with\r\nthe Spaniards, refusing to trade and holding themselves ready to\r\nfight. They limited themselves to listening to the Spaniards' speech\r\nand watching their gestures, after which both parties separated.\r\nThe natives fled the following night at midnight, abandoning their\r\nencampment.\r\n\r\n[Note 8: The present Cape San Augustin; it was sighted Jan. 28,\r\n1500, and named Santa Maria de la Consolacion.]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards describe these people as a vagabond race similar to the\r\nScythians, who had no fixed abode but wandered with their wives and\r\nchildren from one country to another at the harvest seasons. They\r\nswear that the footprints left upon the sand show them to have feet\r\ntwice as large as those of a medium-sized man.[9] Continuing their\r\nvoyage, the Spaniards arrived at the mouth of another river, which\r\nwas, however, too shallow for the caravels to enter. Four shallops of\r\nsoldiers were therefore sent to land and reconnoitre. They observed\r\non a hillock near the bank a group of natives, to whom they sent a\r\nmessenger to invite them to trade. It is thought the natives wanted to\r\ncapture one of the Spaniards and take him with them, for, in exchange\r\nfor a hawk's-bell which he had offered them as an attraction, they\r\nthrew a golden wedge of a cubit's length towards the messenger, and\r\nwhen the Spaniard stooped to take up the piece of gold, the natives\r\nsurrounded him in less time than it takes to tell it, and tried to\r\ndrag him off. He managed to defend himself against his assailants,\r\nusing his sword and buckler until such time as his companions in the\r\nboats could come to his assistance. To conclude in a few words, since\r\nyou spoke to me so urgently of your approaching departure, the natives\r\nkilled eight of the Spaniards and wounded several others with their\r\narrows and javelins. They attacked the barques with great daring from\r\nthe river banks, seeking to drag the boats ashore; although they were\r\nkilled like sheep by sword strokes and lance thrusts (for they were\r\nnaked); they did not on that account yield. They even succeeded in\r\ncarrying off one of the barques, which was empty, and whose pilot had\r\nbeen struck by an arrow and killed. The other barques succeeded in\r\nescaping, and thus the Spaniards left these barbarous natives.\r\n\r\n[Note 9: One of the numerous tales of giants in America, which\r\ncirculated and for a long time obtained credence.]\r\n\r\nMuch saddened by the loss of their companions, the Spaniards followed\r\nthe same coast in a north-westerly direction and, after proceeding\r\nsome forty leagues, they arrived at a sea whose waters are\r\nsufficiently fresh to admit of their replenishing their supply of\r\ndrinking water. Seeking the cause of this phenomenon they discovered\r\nthat several swift rivers which pour down from the mountains came\r\ntogether at that point, and flowed into the sea.[10] A number of\r\nislands dotted this sea, which are described as remarkable for\r\ntheir fertility and numerous population. The natives are gentle and\r\nsociable, but these qualities are of little use to them because they\r\ndo not possess the gold or precious stones which the Spaniards seek.\r\nThirty-six of them were taken prisoners. The natives call that entire\r\nregion Mariatambal. The country to the east of this great river is\r\ncalled Canomora, and that on the west Paricora. The natives gave it\r\nto be understood by signs that in the interior of the country gold of\r\ngood quality was found. Continuing their march, directly north, but\r\nalways following the windings of the coast, the Spaniards again\r\nsighted the polar star. All this coast is a part of Paria, that land\r\nso rich in pearls which Columbus himself discovered, as we have\r\nrelated; he being the real author of these discoveries. The coast\r\nreconnoitred by the Pinzons continues past the Boca de la Sierpe,\r\nalready described, and the districts of Cumana, Manacapana, Curiana,\r\nCauchieta, and Cauchibachoa, and it is thought that it extends to the\r\ncontinent of India.[11] It is evident that this coast is too extended\r\nto belong to an island, and yet, if one takes it altogether, the whole\r\nuniverse may be called an island.[12]\r\n\r\n[Note 10: Possibly the estuary of the Amazon.]\r\n\r\n[Note 11: _Propterea Gangetidis Indiæ continentem putans_. The\r\nRuysch map (1516) shows the junction of the American continent with\r\nAsia.]\r\n\r\n[Note 12: _Licet universum terræ, orbem, large sumptum, insulam\r\ndicere fas sit_.]\r\n\r\nFrom the time when they left the land where they lost sight of the\r\npole star, until they reached Paria, the Spaniards report that\r\nthey proceeded towards the west for a distance of three hundred\r\nuninterrupted leagues. Midway they discovered a large river called\r\nMaragnon, so large in fact that I suspect them of exaggerating; for\r\nwhen I asked them on their return from their voyage if this river was\r\nnot more likely a sea separating two continents, they said that the\r\nwater at its mouth was fresh, and that this quality increased the\r\nfarther one mounted the river. It is dotted with islands and full\r\nof fish. They above all declare that is it more than thirty leagues\r\nbroad, and that its waters flow with such impetuosity that the sea\r\nrecedes before its current.[13]\r\n\r\n[Note 13: The mouth of the Maragnon or Amazon is, in fact, sixty\r\nleagues wide.]\r\n\r\nWhen we recall what is told of the northern and southern mouths of\r\nthe Danube, which drive back the waters of the sea to such a great\r\ndistance and may be drunk by sailors, we cease to be astonished if the\r\nriver described be represented as still larger. What indeed hinders\r\nnature from creating a river even larger than the Danube, or indeed\r\na still larger one than the Maragnon? I think it is some river[14]\r\nalready mentioned by Columbus when he explored the coasts of Paria.\r\nBut all these problems will be elucidated later, so let us now turn\r\nour attention to the natural products of the country.\r\n\r\n[Note 14: Referring to the Orinoco.]\r\n\r\nIn most of the islands of Paria the Spaniards found a forest of\r\nred-coloured wood, of which they brought back three thousand pounds.\r\nThis is the wood which the Italians call _verzino_ and the Spaniards\r\nbrazil wood. They claim that the dye-woods of Hispaniola are superior\r\nfor the dyeing of wools. Profiting by the north-west wind, which the\r\nItalians call the _grecco_[15] they sailed past numerous islands,\r\ndepopulated by the ravages of the cannibals, but fertile, for they\r\ndiscovered numerous traces of destroyed villages. Here and there they\r\ndescried natives, who, prompted by fear, quickly fled to the mountain\r\ncrags and the depths of the forests, as soon as they saw the ships\r\nappear. These people no longer had homes but wandered at large because\r\nthey feared the cannibals. Huge trees were discovered, which produce\r\nwhat is commonly called cinnamon-bark and which is claimed to be\r\njust as efficacious for driving off fevers as the cinnamon which the\r\napothecaries sell. At that season the cinnamon was not yet ripe. I\r\nprefer to rely on those who have made these reports rather than to\r\nweary myself to discuss these questions. Pinzon's men further claim\r\nthat they have found huge trees in that country which sixteen men\r\nholding hands and forming a circle could scarcely encompass with their\r\narms.\r\n\r\n[Note 15: The different points of the compass were designated\r\nby the winds: north being _tramontane_; north-east, _grecco_; east\r\n_levante_; south-east _scirocco_; south, _ostro_; south-west,\r\n_libeccio_; west, _ponente_; north-west, _mæstrale_.]\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary animal[16] inhabits these trees, of which the muzzle\r\nis that of the fox, while the tail resembles that of a marmoset, and\r\nthe ears those of a bat. Its hands are like man's, and its feet like\r\nthose of an ape. This beast carries its young wherever it goes in\r\na sort of exterior pouch, or large bag. You have seen one of these\r\nanimals, at the same time that I did. It was dead, but you have\r\nmeasured it, and you have wondered at that pouch or curious stomach\r\nwith which nature has provided this remarkable animal for carrying\r\nits young and protecting them either against hunters or beasts.\r\nObservation has proven that this animal never takes its young out of\r\nthis pouch save when they are at play or nursing, until the time comes\r\nwhen they are able to fend for themselves. The Spaniards captured one\r\nsuch with its young, but the little ones died one after another, on\r\nshipboard. The mother survived a few months, but was unable to bear\r\nthe change of climate and food. Enough, however, about this animal,\r\nand let us return to the discoverers.\r\n\r\n[Note 16: The animal here described is doubtless the opossum; the\r\nonly non-Australian marsupial found in America.]\r\n\r\nThe Pinzons, uncle and nephew, have endured severe hardships during\r\nthis voyage. They had explored six hundred leagues along the coast\r\nof Paria, believing themselves the while to be at the other side of\r\nCathay on the coast of India, not far from the river Ganges, when in\r\nthe month of July they were overtaken by such a sudden and violent\r\nstorm that, of the four caravels composing the squadron, two were\r\nengulfed before their eyes. The third was torn from its anchorage and\r\ndisappeared; the fourth held good, but was so shattered that its seams\r\nalmost burst. The crew of this fourth ship, in despair of saving\r\nit, landed. They did not know what to do next, and first thought of\r\nbuilding a village and then of killing all the neighbouring people to\r\nforestall being massacred themselves. But happily the luck changed.\r\nThe tempest ceased; the caravel which had been driven off by the fury\r\nof the elements returned with eighty of the crew, while the other\r\nship, which held to her anchorage, was saved. It was with these\r\nships that, after being tossed by the waves and losing many of their\r\nfriends, they returned to Spain, landing at their native town of\r\nPalos, where their wives and children awaited them. This was the eve\r\nof the calends of October.\r\n\r\nPinzon's companions brought a quantity of woods[17] which they\r\nbelieved to be cinnamon and ginger; but, to excuse the poor quality of\r\nthese spices, they said they were not ripe when they were gathered.\r\nBaptista Elysius, who is a remarkable philosopher and doctor of\r\nmedicine, was in possession of certain small stones they had gathered\r\non the shores of that region, and he thinks they are topazes. He told\r\nyou this in my presence. Following the Pinzons and animated by the\r\nspirit of imitation, other Spaniards have made long voyages toward the\r\nsouth, following the track of their forerunners, such as Columbus,\r\nand coasting, in my opinion, along the shores of Paria. These latter\r\nexplorers have collected cinnamon bark, and that precious substance\r\nthe fumes of which banish headaches, and which the Spaniards call\r\n_Anime Album_.[18] I have learned nothing else worthy of your\r\nattention; thus I will conclude my narration since you hasten me by\r\nannouncing your departure.\r\n\r\n[Note 17: Pinzon obtained license to sell a quantity of brazil\r\nwood to pay his debts, his creditors having seized the ships and their\r\ncargoes.]\r\n\r\n[Note 18: _Cassiam et hi fistulam pretiosumque illud ad capitis\r\ngravidinem suo suffumigio tollendam quod Hispani animen album vocant\r\nreferre_.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, to conclude my decade, listen still to some details\r\nconcerning the ridiculous superstitions of Hispaniola. If it is not\r\na decade in the style of Livy, it is only because its author, your\r\nMartyr, has not been blessed, as he should have been according to the\r\ntheory of Pythagoras, with the spirit of Livy. You also know what\r\nmountains in travail bring forth. These things are only the fancies\r\nof the islanders; nevertheless, though fanciful, they are more\r\ninteresting than the true histories of Lucian, for they really do\r\nexist in the form of beliefs, while the histories were invented as a\r\npastime; one may smile at those who believe them.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards lived for some time in Hispaniola without suspecting\r\nthat the islanders worshipped anything else than the stars, or that\r\nthey had any kind of religion; I have indeed several times reported\r\nthat these islanders only adored the visible stars and the heavens.\r\nBut after mingling with them for some years, and the languages\r\nbecoming mutually intelligible, many of the Spaniards began to notice\r\namong them divers ceremonies and rites. Brother Roman,[19] a hermit,\r\nwho went, by order of Columbus, amongst the caciques to instruct them\r\nin the principles of Christianity, has written a book in the Spanish\r\nlanguage on the religious rites of the islanders. I undertake to\r\nreview this work, leaving out some questions of small importance. I\r\nnow offer it to you as follows:\r\n\r\nIt is known that the idols to whom the islanders pay public worship\r\nrepresent goblins which appear to them in the darkness, leading them\r\ninto foolish errors; for they make images, in the forms of seated\r\nfigures, out of plaited cotton, tightly stuffed inside, to represent\r\nthese nocturnal goblins and which resemble those our artists paint\r\nupon walls.\r\n\r\n[Note 19: Roman Pane was a Jeronymite friar who, as here stated,\r\nwrote by order of Columbus. His work was in twenty-six chapters\r\ncovering eighteen pages, and was inserted at the end of the\r\nsixty-first chapter of the _Storia_ of Fernando Columbus. The original\r\nSpanish MS. is lost, the text being known in an Italian translation\r\npublished in Venice in 1571. Brasseur de Bourbourg published a French\r\ntranslation in his work on Yucatan, _Relation des Choses de Yucatan de\r\nDiego Landa_. Paris, 1864.]\r\n\r\nI have sent you four of these images, and you have been able to\r\nexamine them and verify their resemblance to the goblins. You will\r\nalso be able to describe them to the most serene King, your uncle,\r\nbetter than I could do in writing. The natives call these images\r\n_zemes_. When they are about to go into battle, they tie small images\r\nrepresenting little demons upon their foreheads, for which reason\r\nthese figures, as you will have seen, are tied round with strings.\r\nThey believe that the _zemes_ send rain or sunshine in response to\r\ntheir prayers, according to their needs. They believe the _zemes_ to\r\nbe intermediaries between them and God, whom they represent as one,\r\neternal, omnipotent, and invisible. Each cacique has his _zemes_,\r\nwhich he honours with particular care. Their ancestors gave to the\r\nsupreme and eternal Being two names, Iocauna and Guamaonocon. But this\r\nsupreme Being was himself brought forth by a mother, who has five\r\nnames, Attabeira, Mamona, Guacarapita, Iella, and Guimazoa.\r\n\r\nListen now to their singular beliefs relating to the origin of man.\r\nThere exists in Hispaniola a district called Caunauna, where the human\r\nrace took its origin in a cavern on a certain mountain. The greater\r\nnumber of men came forth from the larger apertures, and the lesser\r\nnumber from the smaller apertures of this cavern. Such are their\r\nsuperstitions. The rock on whose side the opening of this cavern\r\nis found is called Cauta, and the largest of the caverns is called\r\nCazabixaba, the smaller Amaiauna. Before mankind was permitted to come\r\nforth, they ingeniously affirm that each night the mouths of the\r\ncaves were confided to the custody of a man called Machochael. This\r\nMachochael, having deserted the two caves from a motive of curiosity,\r\nwas surprised by the sun, whose rays he could not endure, and so was\r\nchanged into stone. They relate amongst their absurdities that when\r\nmen came out of their caverns in the night because they sought to sin\r\nand could not get back before the rising of the sun, which they were\r\nforbidden to see, they were tranformed into myrobolane trees,[20] of\r\nwhich Hispaniola plentiously produces great numbers.\r\n\r\n[Note 20: This name is comprehensive of several kinds of trees\r\nwhose fruits are used in compounding astringent and slightly purgative\r\nmedicines.]\r\n\r\nThey also say that a chief called Vagoniona sent from the cavern where\r\nhe kept his family shut up, a servant to go fishing. This servant,\r\nbeing surprised by the sun, was likewise turned in like manner into a\r\nnightingale. On every anniversary of his transformation he fills the\r\nnight air with songs, bewailing his misfortunes and imploring his\r\nmaster Vagoniona to come to his help. Such is the explanation they\r\ngive for the nightingale's song. As for Vagoniona, he dearly loved\r\nthis servant, and therefore deeply lamented him; he shut up all the\r\nmen in the cavern and only brought out with him the women and nursing\r\nchildren, whom he led to an island called Mathinino, off the coasts;\r\nthere he abandoned the women and brought back the children with him.\r\nThese unfortunate infants were starving, and upon reaching the river\r\nbank they cried \"_Toa, Toa_\" (that is like children crying, Mamma,\r\nMamma), and immediately they were turned into frogs. It is for this\r\nreason that in the springtime the frogs make these sounds, and it is\r\nalso the reason why men alone are frequently found in the caverns\r\nof Hispaniola, and not women. The natives say that Vagoniona still\r\nwanders about the island, and that by a special boon he always remains\r\nas he was. He is supposed to go to meet a beautiful woman, perceived\r\nin the depths of the sea, from whom are obtained the white shells\r\ncalled by the natives _cibas_, and other shells of a yellowish colour\r\ncalled _guianos_, of both of which they make necklaces. The caciques\r\nin our own time regard these trinkets as sacred.[21]\r\n\r\n[Note 21: The following passage does not lend itself to admissible\r\ntranslation. _Viros autem illos, quos sine feminis in antris relictos\r\ndiximus, lotum se ad pluviarum acquarum receptacula noctu referunt\r\nexiisse; atque una noctium, animalia quædam feminas æmulantia, veluti\r\nformicarum agmina, reptare par arbores myrobolanos a longe vidisse. Ad\r\nfeminea ilia animalia procurrunt, capiunt: veluti anguillæ de manibus\r\neorum labuntur. Consilium ineunt. Ex senioris consilio, scabiosos\r\nleprososque, si qui sint inter eos, conquirunt, qui manos asperas\r\ncallossasque habeant ut apræhensa facilius queant ritenere. Hos\r\nhomines ipsi caracaracoles appellant. Venatum proficiscuntur: ex\r\nmultis quas capiebant quatuor tantum retinent; pro feminis illis\r\nuti adnituntur, carere feminea natura comperiunt. Iterum accitis\r\nsenioribus, quid facieudum consulunt. Ut picus avis admittatur, qui\r\nacuto rostra intra ipsorum inguina foramen effodiat, constituerunt:\r\nipsismet caracaracolibus hominibus callosis, feminas apertis cruribus\r\ntenentibus. Quam pulchre picus adducitur! Picus feminis sexum aperit.\r\nHinc bellissime habuit insula, quas cupiebat feminas; hinc procreata\r\nsoboles_. \"I cease to marvel,\" continues the author, \"since it is\r\nwritten in many volumes of veracious Greek history that the Myrmidons\r\nwere generated by ants. Such are some of the many legends which\r\npretended sages expound with calm and unmoved visage from pulpits and\r\ntribunals to a stupid gaping crowd.\"]\r\n\r\nHere is a more serious tradition concerning the origin of the sea.[22]\r\nThere formerly lived in the island a powerful chief named Jaia who\r\nburied his only son in a gourd. Several months later, distracted by\r\nthe loss of his son, Jaia visited the gourd. He pried it open and out\r\nof it he beheld great whales and marine monsters of gigantic size come\r\nforth. Thus he reported to some of his neighbours that the sea was\r\ncontained in that gourd. Upon hearing this story, four brothers born\r\nat a birth and who had lost their mother when they were born sought to\r\nobtain possession of the gourd for the sake of the fish. But Jaia, who\r\noften visited the mortal remains of his son, arrived when the brothers\r\nheld the gourd in their hands. Frightened at being thus taken in the\r\nact both of sacrilege and robbery, they dropped the gourd, which\r\nbroke, and took flight. From the broken gourd the sea rushed forth;\r\nthe valley was filled, the immense plain which formed the universe was\r\nflooded, and only the mountains raised their heads above the water,\r\nforming the islands, several of which still exist to-day. This, Most\r\nIllustrious Prince, is the origin of the sea, nor need you imagine\r\nthat the islander who has handed down this tradition does not enjoy\r\nthe greatest consideration. It is further related that the four\r\nbrothers, in terror of Jaia, fled in different directions and almost\r\ndied of hunger because they dared stop nowhere. Nevertheless, pressed\r\nby famine, they knocked at the door of a baker and asked him for\r\n_cazabi_, that is to say, for bread. The baker spit with such force\r\nupon the first who entered, that an enormous tumour was formed, of\r\nwhich he almost died. After deliberating amongst themselves, they\r\nopened the tumour, with a sharp stone, and from it came forth a woman\r\nwho became the wife of each of the four brothers, one after another,\r\nand bore them sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n[Note 22: Diego Landa, in his _Cosas de Yucatan_, and Cogolludo\r\n(_Hist. de Yucatan_), treat this subject. Peter Martyr likewise\r\nelaborates it in his letters to Pomponius Lætus and the Cardinal de\r\nSanta Croce. _Opus Epistolarum_, ep. 177 and 180.]\r\n\r\nAnother story, most illustrious Prince, is still more quaint. There is\r\na cavern called Jouanaboina, situated in the territory of a cacique\r\ncalled Machinnech, which is venerated with as great respect by the\r\nmajority of the islanders as were formerly the caves of Corinth, of\r\nCyrrha, and Nissa amongst the Greeks.[23] The walls of this cavern\r\nare decorated with different paintings; two sculptured zemes, called\r\nBinthiatelles and Marohos, stand at the entrance.\r\n\r\n[Note 23: The caverns of Hayti have been visited and described by\r\nDecourtilz, _Voyage d'un Naturaliste_. Some of them contain carvings\r\nrepresenting serpents, frogs, deformed human figures in distorted\r\npostures, etc.]\r\n\r\nWhen asked why this cavern is reverenced, the natives gravely reply\r\nthat it is because the sun and moon issued forth from it to illuminate\r\nthe universe. They go on pilgrimages to that cavern just as we go\r\nto Rome, or to the Vatican, Compostela, or the Holy Sepulchre at\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of superstition is as follows. They believe the dead walk\r\nby night and feed upon _guarina_, a fruit resembling the quince,\r\nbut unknown in Europe. These ghosts love to mix with the living and\r\ndeceive women. They take on the form of a man, and seem to wish to\r\nenjoy a woman's favour, but when about to accomplish their purpose\r\nthey vanish into thin air. If any one thinks, upon feeling something\r\nstrange upon his bed, that there is a spectre lying beside him, he\r\nonly needs to assure himself by touching his belly, for, according to\r\ntheir idea, the dead may borrow every human member except the navel.\r\nIf therefore the navel is absent, they know that it is a ghost, and\r\nit is sufficient to touch it to make it immediately disappear. These\r\nghosts frequently appear by night to the living, and very often on the\r\npublic highways; but if the traveller is not frightened, the spectre\r\nvanishes. If, on the contrary, he allows himself to be frightened, the\r\nterror inspired by the apparition is such that many of the islanders\r\ncompletely lose their heads and self-possession. When the Spaniards\r\nasked who ever had infected them with this mass of ridiculous beliefs,\r\nthe natives replied that they received them from their ancestors, and\r\nthat they have been preserved from time immemorial in poems which only\r\nthe sons of chiefs are allowed to learn. These poems are learnt by\r\nheart, for they have no writing; and on feast days the sons of chiefs\r\nsing them to the people, in the form of sacred chants.[24] Their only\r\nmusical instrument is a concave sonorous piece of wood which is beaten\r\nlike a drum.\r\n\r\n[Note 24: Commonly called in the native tongue _arreytos_. Some\r\nspecimens exist. Brasseur de Bourbourg in his _Grammaire Quiché_ gives\r\nthe _Rabinal Achi_.]\r\n\r\nIt is the augurs, called bovites, who encourage these superstitions.\r\nThese men, who are persistent liars, act as doctors for the ignorant\r\npeople, which gives them a great prestige, for it is believed that the\r\nzemes converse with them and reveal the future to them.\r\n\r\nIf a sick man recovers the bovites persuade him that he owes his\r\nrestoration to the intervention of the zemes. When they undertake to\r\ncure a chief, the bovites begin by fasting and taking a purge. There\r\nis an intoxicating herb which they pound up and drink, after which\r\nthey are seized with fury like the mænads, and declare that the zemes\r\nconfide secrets to them. They visit the sick man, carrying in their\r\nmouth a bone, a little stone, a stick, or a piece of meat. After\r\nexpelling every one save two or three persons designated by the sick\r\nperson, the bovite begins by making wild gestures and passing his\r\nhands over the face, lips, and nose, and breathing on the forehead,\r\ntemples, and neck, and drawing in the sick man's breath. Thus he\r\npretends to seek the fever in the veins of the sufferer. Afterwards he\r\nrubs the shoulders, the hips, and the legs, and opens the hands; if\r\nthe hands are clenched he pulls them wide open, exposing the palm,\r\nshaking them vigorously, after which he affirms that he has driven off\r\nthe sickness and that the patient is out of danger. Finally he removes\r\nthe piece of meat he was carrying in his mouth like a juggler, and\r\nbegins to cry, \"This is what you have eaten in excess of your wants;\r\nnow you will get well because I have relieved you of that which you\r\nate.\" If the doctor perceives that the patient gets worse, he ascribes\r\nthis to the zemes, who, he declares, are angry because they have not\r\nhad a house constructed for them, or have not been treated with proper\r\nrespect, or have not received their share of the products of the\r\nfield. Should the sick man die, his relatives indulge in magical\r\nincantations to make him declare whether he is the victim of fate or\r\nof the carelessness of the doctor, who failed to fast properly or gave\r\nthe wrong remedy. If the man died through the fault of the doctor, the\r\nrelatives take vengeance on the latter. Whenever the women succeed in\r\nobtaining the piece of meat which the bovites hold in their mouths,\r\nthey wrap it with great respect in cloths and carefully preserve it,\r\nesteeming it to be a talisman of great efficacy in time of childbirth,\r\nand honouring it as though it were a zemes.\r\n\r\nThe islanders pay homage to numerous zemes, each person having his\r\nown. Some are made of wood, because it is amongst the trees and in the\r\ndarkness of night they have received the message of the gods. Others,\r\nwho have heard the voice amongst the rocks, make their zemes of stone;\r\nwhile others, who heard the revelation while they were cultivating\r\ntheir ages--that kind of cereal I have already mentioned,--make theirs\r\nof roots.\r\n\r\nPerhaps they think that these last watch over their bread-making.\r\nIt was thus that the ancients believed that the dryads, hamadryads,\r\nsatyrs, pans, nereids, watched over the fountains, forests, and\r\nseas, attributing to each force in nature a presiding divinity. The\r\nislanders of Hispaniola even believe that the zemes respond to their\r\nwishes when they invoke them. When the caciques wish to consult the\r\nzemes, concerning the result of a war, about the harvest, or their\r\nhealth, they enter the houses sacred to them and there absorb the\r\nintoxicating herb called _kohobba_, which is the same as that used by\r\nthe bovites to excite their frenzy. Almost immediately they believe\r\nthey see the room turn upside down, and men walking with their heads\r\ndownwards. This kohobba powder is so strong that those who take it\r\nlose consciousness; when the stupefying action of the powder begins\r\nto wane, the arms and hands become loose and the head droops. After\r\nremaining for some time in this attitude, the cacique raises his head,\r\nas though he were awakening from sleep, and, lifting his eyes to the\r\nheavens, begins to stammer some incoherent words. His chief attendants\r\ngather round him (for none of the common people are admitted to these\r\nmysteries), raising their voices in thanksgiving that he has so\r\nquickly left the zemes and returned to them. They ask him what he has\r\nseen, and the cacique declares that he was in conversation with\r\nthe zemes during the whole time, and as though he were still in a\r\nprophetic delirium, he prophesies victory or defeat, if a war is to be\r\nundertaken, or whether the crops will be abundant, or the coming of\r\ndisaster, or the enjoyment of health, in a word, whatever first occurs\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nCan you feel surprised after this, Most Illustrious Prince, at the\r\nspirit of Apollo which inspired the fury of the Sibyls? You thought\r\nthat that ancient superstition had perished, but you see that such is\r\nnot the case. I have treated here in a general sense all that concerns\r\nthe zemes, but I think I should not omit certain particulars. The\r\ncacique Guamaretus had a zemes called Corochotus, which he had\r\nfixed in the highest part of his house. It is said that Corochotus\r\nfrequently came down, after having broken his bonds. This happened\r\nwhenever he wished to make love or eat or hide himself; and sometimes\r\nhe disappeared for several days, thus showing his anger at having been\r\nneglected and not sufficiently honoured by the cacique Guamaretus.\r\nOne day two children, wearing crowns, were born in the house of\r\nGuamaretus; it was thought that they were the sons of the zemes\r\nCorochotus. Guamaretus was defeated by his enemies in a pitched\r\nbattle; his palace and town were burnt and destroyed; and Corochotus\r\nburst his bonds and sprang out of the house, and was found a stadium\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nAnother zemes, Epileguanita, was represented in the form of a\r\nquadruped, carved out of wood. He often left the place where he\r\nwas venerated and fled into the forests. And each time that his\r\nworshippers heard of his flight, they assembled and sought him\r\neverywhere with devout prayers. When found, they brought him\r\nreverently on their shoulders back to the sanctuary sacred to him.\r\nWhen the Christians landed in Hispaniola, Epileguanita fled and\r\nappeared no more, which was considered a sinister forecast of the\r\nmisfortunes of the country. These traditions are handed down by the\r\nold men.\r\n\r\nThe islanders venerate another zemes, made of marble, which is of\r\nthe feminine sex, and is accompanied by two male zemes who serve as\r\nattendants; one acting as herald to summon other zemes to the woman's\r\nassistance when she wishes to raise storms or draw down clouds and\r\nrains; the other is supposed to collect the water which flows down\r\nfrom the high mountains into the valleys, and upon the command of the\r\nfemale zemes to let it loose in the form of torrents which devastate\r\nthe country whenever the islanders have failed to pay her idol the\r\nhonours due to it. One more thing worthy of remembrance and I shall\r\nhave finished my book. The natives of Hispaniola were much impressed\r\nby the arrival of the Spaniards. Formerly two caciques, of whom one\r\nwas the father of Guarionex, fasted for fifteen days in order to\r\nconsult the zemes about the future. This fast having disposed the\r\nzemes in their favour, they answered that within a few years a race of\r\nmen wearing clothes would land in the island and would overthrow their\r\nreligious rites and ceremonies, massacre their children, and make them\r\nslaves. This prophecy had been taken by the younger generation to\r\napply to the cannibals; and thus whenever it became known that the\r\ncannibals had landed anywhere, the people took flight without even\r\nattempting any resistance. But when the Spaniards landed, the\r\nislanders then referred the prophecy to them, as being the people\r\nwhose coming was announced. And in this they were not wrong, for they\r\nare all under the dominion of the Christians, and those who resisted\r\nhave been killed; all the zemes having been removed to Spain, to teach\r\nus the foolishness of those images and the deceits of devils, nothing\r\nremaining of them but a memory. I have brought some things to your\r\nknowledge, Most Illustrious Prince, and you will learn many others\r\nlater, since you will probably leave to-morrow to accompany your\r\ngreat-aunt to Naples, in obedience to the orders of your uncle, King\r\nFrederick. You are ready to leave and I am weary. Therefore, fare\r\nyou well, and keep the remembrance of your Martyr, whom you have\r\nconstrained in the name of your uncle, Frederick, to choose these few\r\nfrom amongst many great things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK X\r\n\r\nAND EPILOGUE TO THE DECADE\r\n\r\nTO INIGO LOPEZ MENDOZA, COUNT OF TENDILLA, VICEROY OF GRANADA\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been prompted by the letters of my friends and of high\r\npersonages to compose a complete chronicle of all that has happened\r\nsince the first discoveries and the conquest of the ocean by Columbus,\r\nand of all that shall occur. My correspondents were lost in admiration\r\nat the thought of these discoveries of islands, inhabited by unknown\r\npeoples, living without clothes and satisfied with what nature gave\r\nthem, and they were consumed by desire to be kept regularly informed.\r\nAscanio, whose authority never allowed my pen to rest, was degraded\r\nfrom the high position he occupied when his brother Ludovico[1] was\r\ndriven by the French from Milan. I had dedicated the first two books\r\nof this decade to him, without mentioning many other treatises I had\r\nselected from my unedited memoirs. Simultaneously with his overthrow I\r\nceased to write, for, buffeted by the storm, he ceased to exhort me,\r\nwhile my fervour in making enquiries languished; but in the year 1500,\r\nwhen the Court was in residence at Granada, Ludovico, Cardinal of\r\nAragon, and nephew of King Frederick, who had accompanied the Queen\r\nof Naples, sister of King Frederick, to Grenada, sent me letters\r\naddressed to me by the King himself, urging me to select the necessary\r\ndocuments and to continue the first two books addressed to Ascanio.\r\nThe King and the Cardinal already possessed the writings I had\r\nformerly addressed to Ascanio. You are aware that I was ill at the\r\ntime, yet, unwilling to refuse, I resolved to continue. Amongst the\r\ngreat mass of material furnished me at my request by the discoverers,\r\nI selected such deeds as were most worthy to be recorded. Since you\r\nnow desire to include my complete works amongst the numerous volumes\r\nin your library, I have determined to add to those of my former\r\nwritings by taking up the narrative of the principal events between\r\nthe years 1500 and 1510, and, God giving me life, I shall one day\r\ntreat them more fully.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: His downfall was greeted with rejoicing throughout Italy.\r\nIn Venice the joy-bells rang and the children danced and sang a\r\n_canzone_ in Piazza San Marco\r\n\r\n  _Ora il Moro fa la danza\r\n   Viva San Marco e il re di Franzia_.\r\n\r\nMilan fell a prey to Louis XII., and all northern Italy passed under\r\nthe French yoke. The Pope rewarded the bearer of the news with a\r\npresent of one hundred ducats, and at once seized Cardinal Ascanio's\r\npalace with its art treasures. The Cardinal was captured near Rivolta\r\nby the Venetians, who delivered him to the French. He was kept in the\r\ncitadel of Bourges until 1502, when he was released at the request of\r\nthe Cardinal d'Amboise to take his place in the conclave which elected\r\nPius III. He died in 1505; and his former enemy, Guiliano della\r\nRovere, reigning as Pope Julius II., erected the magnificent monument\r\nto his memory which still stands in Santa Maria del Popolo.]\r\n\r\nTo complete the decade, I had written a book which remained\r\nunfinished, treating of the superstitions of the islanders; this new\r\nbook, which will be called the tenth and last, I wish to dedicate to\r\nyou, without rewriting my work or sending you my draft. Therefore,\r\nif on reading the ninth book you come across promises which are not\r\nrealised, do not be astonished; it is not necessary to be always\r\nconsistent.[2]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: _Non semper oportet stare pollicitis_.]\r\n\r\nLet us now come to our subject. During these ten years many\r\nexplorers,[3] have visited various coasts, following for the most part\r\nin the track of Columbus. They have always coasted along the shore of\r\nParia, believing it to be part of the Indian continent. Some heading\r\nto the west, others to the east, they have discovered new countries\r\nrich in gold and spices, for most of them have brought back necklaces\r\nand perfumes obtained in exchange for our merchandise, or by violence\r\nand conquest. Despite their nakedness, it must be admitted that in\r\nsome places the natives have exterminated entire groups of Spaniards,\r\nfor they are ferocious and are armed with poisoned arrows and sharp\r\nlances with points hardened in the fire. Even the animals, reptiles,\r\ninsects, and quadrupeds are different from ours, and exhibit\r\ninnumerable and strange species. With the exception of lions, tigers,\r\nand crocodiles, they are not dangerous. I am now speaking of the\r\nforests of the district of Paria and not of the islands, where, I\r\nam told, there is not a single dangerous animal, everything in the\r\nislands speaking of great mildness, with the exception of the Caribs\r\nor cannibals, of whom I have already spoken and who have an appetite\r\nfor human flesh. There are likewise different species of birds, and in\r\nmany places bats[4] as large as pigeons flew about the Spaniards as\r\nsoon as twilight fell, biting them so cruelly that the men, rendered\r\ndesperate, were obliged to give way before them as though they had\r\nbeen harpies. One night, while sleeping on the sand, a monster issued\r\nfrom the sea and seized a Spaniard by the back and, notwithstanding\r\nthe presence of his companions, carried him off, jumping into the sea\r\nwith his victim despite the unfortunate man's shrieks.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: Labastidas, Pinzon, Hojeda, Vespucci, Las Casas, and\r\nothers.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Vampire bats, which haunt the Venezuelan coast in large\r\nnumbers.]\r\n\r\nIt is the royal plan to establish fortified places and to take\r\npossession of this continent, nor are there wanting Spaniards who\r\nwould not shrink from the difficulty of conquering and subjugating\r\nthe territory. For this purpose they petitioned the King for his\r\nauthorisation.\r\n\r\nThe journey, however, is long and the country very extensive. It\r\nis claimed that the newly discovered country, whether continent or\r\nisland, is three times larger than Europe, without counting the\r\nregions to the south which were discovered by the Portuguese and which\r\nare still larger. Certainly the Spain of to-day deserves the highest\r\npraise for having revealed to the present generation these myriad\r\nregions of the Antipodes, heretofore unknown, and for having thus\r\nenlarged for writers the field of study. I am proud to have shown them\r\nthe way by collecting these facts which, as you will see, are without\r\npretension; not only because I am unable to adorn my subject more\r\nornately, but also because I have never thought to write as a\r\nprofessional historian. I tell a simple story by means of letters,\r\nwritten freely to give pleasure to certain persons whose invitations\r\nit would have been difficult for me to refuse. Enough, however, of\r\ndigressions, and let us return to Hispaniola.\r\n\r\nThe bread made by the natives is found, by those who are accustomed to\r\nour wheat bread, to be insufficiently nourishing and therefore they\r\nlose their strength. The King consequently issued a recent decree,\r\nordering that wheat should be sown in different places and at\r\ndifferent seasons. The harvest produced nothing but straw, similar to\r\ntwigs, and with little grain; although what there is, is large and\r\nwell formed. This also applies to the pastures where the grass grows\r\nas high as the crops; thus the cattle become extraordinarily fat, but\r\ntheir flesh loses its flavour; their muscles become flabby, and they\r\nare, so to say, watery. With pigs it is just the contrary; for they\r\nare healthy and of an agreeable flavour. This is due doubtless to\r\ncertain of the island's fruits they greedily devour. Pork is about\r\nthe only kind of meat bought in the markets. The pigs have rapidly\r\nincreased, but they have become wild since they are no longer kept\r\nby swineherds. There is no need to acclimatise any other species of\r\nanimal or birds in Hispaniola.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the young of all animals flourish on the abundant pasturage\r\nand become larger than their sires. They only eat grass, not barley\r\nor other grain. Enough however of Hispaniola; let us now consider the\r\nneighbouring islands.\r\n\r\nOwing to its length, Cuba was for a long time considered to be a\r\ncontinent, but it has been discovered to be an island. It is not\r\nastonishing that the islanders assured the Spaniards who explored it\r\nthat the land had no end, for the Cubans are poor-spirited people,\r\nsatisfied with little and never leaving their territory. They took no\r\nnotice of what went on amongst their neighbours, and whether there\r\nwere any other regions under their skies than the one they inhabited,\r\nthey did not know. Cuba extends from east to west and is much longer\r\nthan Hispaniola, but from the north to the south it is, in proportion\r\nto its length, very narrow, and is almost everywhere fertile and\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nThere is a small island lying not far off the east coast of\r\nHispaniola, which the Spaniards have placed under the invocation of\r\nSan Juan.[5] This island is almost square and very rich gold mines\r\nhave been found there, but as everybody is busy working the mines of\r\nHispaniola, miners have not yet been sent to San Juan, although it is\r\nplanned so to do. It is gold alone of all the products of Hispaniola\r\nto which the Spaniards give all their attention, and this is how\r\nthey proceed. Each industrious Spaniard, who enjoys some credit, has\r\nassigned to him one or more caciques (that is to say chiefs) and\r\nhis subjects, who, at certain seasons in the year established by\r\nagreement, is obliged to come with his people to the mine belonging to\r\nthat Spaniard, where the necessary tools for extracting the gold are\r\ndistributed to them. The cacique and his men receive a salary, and\r\nwhen they return to the labour of their fields, which cannot be\r\nneglected for fear of famine, one brings away a jacket, one a shirt,\r\none a cloak, and another a hat. Such articles of apparel please them\r\nvery much, and they now no longer go naked. Their labour is thus\r\ndivided between the mines and their own fields as though they were\r\nslaves. Although they submit to this restraint with impatience, they\r\ndo put up with it. Mercenaries of this kind are called _anaborios_.\r\nThe King does not allow them to be treated as slaves, and they are\r\ngranted and withdrawn as he pleases.[6]\r\n\r\n[Note 5: Porto Rico.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6: The system of repartimientos. Consult the writings of Las\r\nCasas on this subject.]\r\n\r\nWhen they are summoned, as soldiers or camp-followers are drafted by\r\nrecruiting agents, the islanders fly to the woods and mountains if\r\nthey can, and rather than submit to this labour they live on whatever\r\nwild fruit they find. They are a docile people, and have completely\r\nforgotten their old rites, complying without reasoning, and repeating\r\nthe mysteries they are taught. The Spanish gentlemen of position\r\neducate sons of caciques in their own houses, and these lads easily\r\nlearn the elements of instruction and good manners. When they grow\r\nup and especially if their fathers are dead, they are sent back to\r\nHispaniola, where they rule their compatriots. As they are devout\r\nChristians, they keep both Spaniards and natives up to their duties,\r\nand cheerfully bring their subjects to the mines. There are gold mines\r\nfound in two different districts, of which the first, called San\r\nCristobal, is about thirty miles from the town of Dominica. The other,\r\ncalled Cibaua, is about ninety miles distant. Porto Real is situated\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nGreat revenues are drawn from these countries, for gold is found both\r\non the surface and in the rocks, either in the form of ingots or of\r\nscales which are sometimes small but generally of considerable weight.\r\nIngots weigh 300 pounds, and sometimes even more, for one has been\r\nfound which weighed 310 pounds.[7] You have heard it said that this\r\none was brought, just as it was found, to the King of Spain, on board\r\nthe ship on which the governor Bobadilla embarked for Spain. The ship,\r\nbeing overloaded with men and gold, was wrecked and sunk with all it\r\ncontained. More than a thousand witnesses saw and touched this ingot.\r\nWhen I speak of pounds I do not mean precisely a pound, but a weight\r\nequal to a golden ducat of four ounces, which is what the Spaniards\r\ncall a _peso_ or castellano of gold. All the gold found in the\r\nmountains of Cibaua is transported to the blockhouse of La Concepcion,\r\nwhere there are founderies for receiving and melting the metal. The\r\nroyal fifth is first separated, after which each one receives a share\r\naccording to his labour. The gold from the mines of San Cristobal goes\r\nto the founderies of Bona Ventura; the amount of gold melted in these\r\nfounderies exceeds 300 pounds of metal. Any Spaniard who is convicted\r\nof having fraudulently kept back a quantity of gold not declared to\r\nthe royal inspectors, suffers confiscation of all the gold in his\r\npossession. Contentions frequently occur among them, and if the\r\nmagistrates of the island are unable to settle them, the cases are\r\nappealed to the Royal Council, the decisions of that tribunal being\r\nwithout appeal in the King's dominions of Castile.\r\n\r\n[Note 7: Las Casas describes the finding of this nugget by an\r\nIndian girl, who accidentally turned it up while idly prodding\r\nthe ground with a sharp instrument. He gives its weight as 3600\r\ncastellanos, equivalent to thirty-five pounds. The vessel which was\r\nto carry it to Spain was wrecked in a violent storm, just outside the\r\nharbour, and the famous nugget was lost. _Las Casas, his Life, his\r\nApostolate, and his Writings_, cap. iii.]\r\n\r\nAt the present time the members composing this tribunal are all\r\ndistinguished noblemen of illustrious blood, whom I will enumerate\r\nin the order in which they sit in judging a case. The first place is\r\noccupied by Antonio Rojas, Archbishop of Granada, who is your kinsman;\r\nhe is a veritable Cato, unable to condone his own offences or those of\r\nhis relatives. His life is austere and he cultivates literature. He\r\nholds the first place in the Council, or in other words, he is the\r\nPresident thereof. The other members of the Council rank by seniority,\r\naccording to the order in which they were appointed. All are doctors\r\nor designates or holders of some decoration. The designates are those\r\nwho are called in Spanish licenciates. All are nominated by the King.\r\nThe Dean of the Assembly is Pedro Oropesa; next to him comes Ludovico\r\nZapato; then, in regular order, Fernando Tellez, Garcias Moxica,\r\nLorenzo Carvajal; Toribio Santiago sits next to the last-named, and\r\nafter him come Juan Lopez, Palacios Rivas, and Ludovico Polanco.\r\nFrancisco Vargas, who is likewise royal treasurer, sits next, and the\r\ntwo last places are held by priests, Sosa and Cabrero, both doctors of\r\nCanon law. The counsellors do not judge criminal cases, but all civil\r\nsuits are within their cognisance.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the new countries, from which we have wandered.\r\nThese countries are very numerous, diversified, and fertile; neither\r\nSaturn nor Hercules nor any hero of antiquity who set out for the\r\ndiscovery or conquest of unknown lands, excelled the exploits of our\r\ncontemporary Spaniards. Behold, how posterity will see the Christian\r\nreligion extended! How far it will be possible to travel amongst\r\nmankind! Neither by word of mouth nor by my pen can I express my\r\nsentiments concerning these wondrous events, and I, therefore, leave\r\nmy book without an ending, always counting upon making further\r\nresearches and collecting documents for a more detailed description in\r\nmy letters, when I shall be at leisure to write.\r\n\r\nFor I am not ignorant that our Admiral, Columbus,[8] with four ships\r\nand a crew of seventy men furnished him by the sovereigns, has\r\nexplored during the year 1502 the country extending about one hundred\r\nand thirty leagues west between Cuba and the continent; an island rich\r\nin fruit trees, which is called Guanassa. The Admiral always followed\r\nthe coast towards the east, hoping by this manoeuvre to regain the\r\nwaters of Paria, but in this he was disappointed. It is claimed that\r\nthe western coasts have also been visited by Vincent Yañez, of whom\r\nI have previously written, Juan Diaz Solis de Nebrissa and sundry\r\nothers, but I have no precise information on this point.[9] May God\r\ngrant me life, that you may some day learn more upon this subject. And\r\nnow you farewell.\r\n\r\n[Note 8: This refers to the fourth voyage of Columbus; consult\r\n_Storia del Fernando Columbo_; Navarrete, i., 314, 329, 332; ii., 277,\r\n296; iii., 555, 558. Also the _Lettera rarissima_, written by Columbus\r\nfrom Jamaica, July 7, 1503, to the Catholic sovereigns; Washington\r\nIrving, _Columbus and his Companions_.]\r\n\r\n[Note 9: Consult Gaffarel, _Les Contemporains de Colomb_;\r\nVespucci, _Quatuor Navigationes_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Second Decade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\nPETER MARTYR, OF MILAN, APOSTOLIC PROTONOTARY AND ROYAL COUNSELLOR TO\r\nTHE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF LEO X\r\n\r\n\r\nMost Holy Father,[1] Since the arrival at the Spanish Court of\r\nGaleazzo Butrigario of Bologna sent by Your Holiness, and Giovanni\r\nAccursi of Florence, sent by that glorious Republic, I have\r\nunceasingly frequented their company and studied to please them,\r\nbecause of their virtues and their wisdom. Both take pleasure in\r\nreading various authors and certain books which have fallen by chance\r\ninto their hands, works treating of the vast regions hitherto unknown\r\nto the world, and of the Occidental lands lying almost at the\r\nAntipodes which the Spaniards recently discovered. Despite its\r\nunpolished style, the novelty of the narrative charmed them, and\r\nthey besought me, as well on their own behalf as in the name of Your\r\nHoliness, to complete my writings by continuing the narrative of all\r\nthat has since happened, and to send a copy to Your Beatitude so that\r\nyou might understand to what degree, thanks to the encouragement of\r\nthe Spanish sovereigns, the human race has been rendered illustrious\r\nand the Church Militant extended. For these new nations are as a\r\n_tabula rasa_; they easily accept the beliefs of our religion and\r\ndiscard their barbarous and primitive rusticity after contact with our\r\ncompatriots. I have deemed it well to yield to the insistence of\r\nwise men who enjoyed the favour of Your Holiness; indeed, had I not\r\nimmediately obeyed an invitation in the name of Your Beatitude, I\r\nshould have committed an inexpiable crime. I shall now summarise in\r\na few words the discoveries by the Spaniards of unknown coasts, the\r\nauthors of the chief expeditions, the places they landed, the hopes\r\nraised, and the promises held out by these new countries.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: Giovanni de' Medici, elected in 1513, assumed the title\r\nof Leo X. He was keenly interested in the exploration and discoveries\r\nin America, and unceasingly urged his nuncios to keep him supplied\r\nwith everything written on these subjects.]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of these lands I have mentioned, by the Genoese,\r\nChristopher Columbus, was related in my Ocean Decade, which\r\nwas printed without my permission[2] and circulated throughout\r\nChristendom. Columbus afterwards explored immense seas and countries\r\nto the south-west, approaching within fifteen degrees of the\r\nequinoctial line. In those parts he saw great rivers, lofty\r\nsnow-capped mountains along the coasts, and also secure harbours.\r\nAfter his death the sovereigns took steps to assume possession of\r\nthose countries and to colonise them with Christians, in order that\r\nour religion might be propagated. The royal notaries afforded every\r\nfacility to every one who wished to engage in these honourable\r\nenterprises among whom two were notable: Diego Nicuesa de Baëcca, an\r\nAndalusian, and Alonzo Hojeda de Concha.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Peter Martyr's friend, Lucio Marineo Siculo, was\r\nresponsible for this premature Spanish edition published in 1511.\r\nAn Italian edition of the First Decade was printed by Albertino\r\nVercellese at Venice in 1504.]\r\n\r\nBoth these men were living in Hispaniola where, as we have already\r\nsaid, the Spaniards had founded a town and colonies, when Alonzo\r\nHojeda first set out, about the ides of December, with about three\r\nhundred soldiers under his command. His course was almost directly\r\nsouth, until he reached one of those ports previously discovered and\r\nwhich Columbus had named Carthagena, because its island breakwater,\r\nits extent, and its coast shaped like a scythe reminded him of\r\nCarthagena. The island lying across the mouth of the port is called by\r\nthe natives Codego, just as the Spaniards call the island in front of\r\nCarthagena, Scombria. The neighbouring region is called Caramairi, a\r\ncountry whose inhabitants, both male and female, are large and well\r\nformed, although they are naked. The men wear their hair cut short to\r\nthe ears, while the women wear theirs long. Both sexes are extremely\r\nskilful bowmen.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards discovered certain trees in the province which bear\r\nfruits that are sweet, but most dangerous, for when eaten they produce\r\nworms. Most of all is the shade of this tree noxious, for whoever\r\nsleeps for any length of time beneath its branches, wakens with a\r\nswollen head, and almost blind, though this blindness abates within a\r\nfew days. The port of Carthagena lies four hundred and fifty-six miles\r\nfrom the port of Hispaniola called Beata, where preparations are\r\ngenerally made for voyages of discovery. Immediately on landing,\r\nHojeda attacked the scattered and defenceless natives. They had been\r\nconceded to him by royal patent because they had formerly treated some\r\nChristians most cruelly and could never be prevailed upon to receive\r\nthe Spaniards amicably in their country. Only a small quantity of\r\ngold, and that of poor quality, was found amongst them; they use the\r\nmetal for making leaves and disks, which they hang on their breasts as\r\nornaments. Hojeda was not satisfied with these spoils, and taking some\r\nprisoners with him as guides, he attacked a village in the interior\r\ntwelve miles distant from the shore, where the fugitives from the\r\ncoast-town had taken refuge. These men, though naked, were warlike;\r\nthey used wooden shields, some long and others curved, also long\r\nwooden swords, bows and arrows, and lances whose points were either\r\nhardened in the fire or made of bone. Assisted by their guests, they\r\nmade a desperate attack on the Spaniards, for they were excited by the\r\nmisfortunes of those who had sought refuge with them, after having\r\nlost their wives and children, whose massacre by the Spaniards\r\nthey had witnessed. The Spaniards were defeated and both Hojeda's\r\nlieutenant, Juan de la Cosa,[3] the first discoverer of gold in the\r\nsands of Uraba, and seventy soldiers fell. The natives poisoned their\r\narrows with the juice of a death-dealing herb. The other Spaniards\r\nheaded by Hojeda turned their backs and fled to the ships, where they\r\nremained, saddened and depressed by this calamity, until the arrival\r\nof another leader, Diego de Nicuesa, in command of twelve ships. When\r\nHojeda and Cosa sailed from Hispaniola, they had left Nicuesa in the\r\nport of Beata still busy with his preparations. His force numbered\r\nseven hundred and eighty-five soldiers, for he was an older man\r\nthan Hojeda, and he had greater authority; hence a larger number of\r\nvolunteers, in choosing between the two leaders, preferred to join the\r\nexpedition of Nicuesa; moreover it was reported that Veragua, which\r\nhad been granted to Nicuesa by the royal patent, was richer in gold\r\nthan Uraba, which Alonzo de Hojeda had obtained.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: Such was the sad end of the pilot of Columbus. The oldest\r\nmap of the New World, now preserved at Madrid, was the work of this\r\nnoted cartographer.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as Nicuesa landed, the two leaders after conferring together,\r\ndecided that the first victims should be avenged, so they set out that\r\nsame night to attack the murderers of Cosa and his seventy companions.\r\nIt was the last watch of the night, when they surprised the natives,\r\nsurrounding and setting fire to their village, which contained more\r\nthan one hundred houses. The usual number of inhabitants was tripled\r\nby the refugees who had there taken shelter.\r\n\r\nThe village was destroyed, for the houses were built of wood covered\r\nwith palm-leaves. Out of the great multitude of men and women, only\r\nsix infants were spared, all the others having been murdered or burnt\r\nwith their effects. These children told the Spaniards that Cosa and\r\nthe others had been cut into bits and devoured by their murderers. It\r\nis thought indeed that the natives of Caramairi are of the same origin\r\nas the Caribs, or cannibals, who are eaters of human flesh. Very\r\nlittle gold was found amongst the ashes. It is in reality the thirst\r\nfor gold, not less than the covetousness of new countries, which\r\nprompted the Spaniards to court such dangers. Having thus avenged the\r\ndeath of Cosa and his companions, they returned to Carthagena.\r\n\r\nHojeda, who was the first to arrive, was likewise the first to\r\nleave, starting with his men in search of Uraba, which is under his\r\njurisdiction. On his way thither he came upon an island called\r\nLa Fuerte, which lies halfway between Uraba and the harbour of\r\nCarthagena. There he landed and found it inhabited by ferocious\r\ncannibals, of whom he captured two men and seven women, the others\r\nmanaging to escape. He likewise gathered one hundred and ninety\r\ndrachmas of gold made into necklaces of various kinds. He finally\r\nreached the eastern extremity of Uraba. This is called Caribana,\r\nbecause it is from this country that the insular Caribs derive their\r\norigin, and have hence kept the name.[4] Hojeda's first care was to\r\nprovide protection, and to this end he built a village defended by a\r\nfort. Having learned from his prisoners that there was a town twelve\r\nmiles in the interior, called Tirufi, celebrated for its gold mines,\r\nhe made preparations for its capture. The inhabitants of Tirufi were\r\nready to defend their rights, and Hojeda was repulsed with loss and\r\ndisgrace; these natives likewise used poisoned arrows in fighting.\r\nDriven by want, he attacked another village some days later, and was\r\nwounded by an arrow in the hip; some of his companions affirm that he\r\nwas shot by a native whose wife he had taken prisoner. The husband\r\napproached and negotiated amicably with Hojeda for the ransom of\r\nhis wife, promising to deliver, on a fixed day, the amount of gold\r\ndemanded of him. On the day agreed upon he returned, armed with\r\narrows and javelins but without the gold. He was accompanied by eight\r\ncompanions, all of whom were ready to die to avenge the injury done to\r\nthe inhabitants of Carthagena and also the people of the village. This\r\nnative was killed by Hojeda's soldiers, and could no longer enjoy the\r\ncaresses of his beloved wife; but Hojeda, under the influence of the\r\npoison, saw his strength ebbing daily away.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: The place of origin of the Caribs is disputed, some\r\nauthorities tracing them to Guiana, others to Venezuela, others to the\r\nAntilles, etc.]\r\n\r\nAt this juncture arrived the other commander, Nicuesa, to whom the\r\nprovince of Veragua, lying west of Uraba, had been assigned as a\r\nresidence. He had sailed with his troops from the port of Carthagena\r\nthe day after Hojeda's departure, with Veragua for his destination,\r\nand entered the gulf called by the natives Coiba, of whom the cacique\r\nwas named Caeta. The people thereabouts speak an entirely different\r\nlanguage from those of Carthagena and Uraba. The dialects of even\r\nneighbouring tribes are very dissimilar.[5] For instance, in\r\nHispaniola, a king is called _cacique_, whereas in the province of\r\nCoiba he is called _chebi_, and elsewhere _tiba_; a noble is called in\r\nHispaniola _taino_, in Coiba _saccus_, and in other parts _jura_.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: _La Bibliothèque Américaine_ of Leclerc contains a list\r\nof the different works on American languages. Consult also Ludwig,\r\n_The Literature of American Aboriginal Languages_.]\r\n\r\nNicuesa proceeded from Coiba to Uraba, the province of his ally\r\nHojeda. Some days later, being on board one of the large merchant\r\nvessels called by the Spaniards caravels, he ordered the other ships\r\nto follow at a distance, keeping with him two vessels with double sets\r\nof oars, of the type called brigantines. I may here say that during\r\nthe rest of my narrative it is my intention to give to these\r\nbrigantines as well as to the other types of ships the names they bear\r\nin the vulgar tongue. I do this that I may be more clearly understood,\r\nregardless of the teeth of critics who rend the works of authors. Each\r\nday new wants arise, impossible to translate with the vocabulary left\r\nus by the venerable majesty of antiquity.\r\n\r\nAfter Nicuesa's departure Hojeda was joined by a ship from Hispaniola\r\nwith a crew of sixty men commanded by Bernardino de Calavera, who had\r\nstolen it. Neither the maritime commander, or to speak more plainly\r\nthe Admiral,--nor the authorities had consented to his departure. The\r\nprovisions brought by this ship somewhat restored the strength of the\r\nSpaniards.\r\n\r\nThe complaints of the men against Hojeda increased from day to day;\r\nfor they accused him of having deceived them. He alleged in his\r\ndefence, that by virtue of the powers he held from the King he had\r\ndirected the bachelor Enciso, who was chief justice and whom he had\r\nselected because of his great legal abilities, to follow him with a\r\nshipload of stores; and that he was much astonished that the latter\r\nhad not long since arrived. He spoke the truth, for at the time of\r\nhis departure, Enciso had already more than half completed his\r\npreparations. His companions, however, who considered they had been\r\nduped, did not believe in the sincerity of his affirmations about\r\nEnciso, and a number of them secretly planned to seize two brigantines\r\nbelonging to Hojeda, and to return to Hispaniola. Upon discovering\r\nthis plot, Hojeda decided to anticipate their plan and, leaving\r\nFrancisco Pizarro, a nobleman[6] who commanded the forts he had built,\r\nhe took some of his men and went on board the ship we have mentioned.\r\nHis intention was to go to Hispaniola, not only to recover from the\r\nwound in his hip, but also to learn the causes of Enciso's delay. He\r\npromised his companions to return in less than fifty days. Out of the\r\nthree hundred there only remained about sixty men, for the others had\r\neither perished of hunger or had been slain by the natives. Pizarro\r\nand his men pledged themselves to remain at their posts until his\r\nreturn within fifty days bringing provisions and reinforcements. When\r\nthe established time elapsed, finding themselves reduced by famine,\r\nthey boarded the brigantines and abandoned Uraba.\r\n\r\n[Note 6: Pizarro was far from being a nobleman, his mother being a\r\npeasant woman and his father the captain Gonzalo Pizarro.]\r\n\r\nDuring their journey to Hispaniola a tempest overtook them on the high\r\nseas, which wrecked one of the brigantines with all its crew; and\r\nthe survivors relate that they distinctly saw, circling round the\r\nbrigantine, a gigantic fish which smashed the rudder to pieces with a\r\nblow of its tail. Gigantic sea monsters certainly do exist in those\r\nwaters. Without a rudder and buffeted by the storm, the brigantine\r\nsank not far from the coast of the island, named La Fuerte, which lies\r\nhalf way between Uraba and Carthagena. The remaining brigantine which\r\noutrode the storm, was repulsed from the island by the natives who\r\nrushed from every direction armed with bows and arrows.\r\n\r\nPursuing his course, Pizarro encountered by chance the bachelor Enciso\r\nbetween the bay of Carthagena and the country called Cuchibacoa, which\r\nlies at the mouth of the river the Spaniards have named Boiugatti or\r\ncathouse, because it was there they first saw a cat, and _boiu_ means\r\n_house_ in the language of Hispaniola.\r\n\r\nEnciso had one vessel laden with all kinds of provisions, foodstuffs,\r\nand clothing, and he was followed by a brigantine. He it was whose\r\nship Hojeda had awaited with impatience. He had left Hispaniola on\r\nthe ides of September, and four days later had recognised the lofty\r\nmountains Columbus had first discovered in this region and which they\r\nhad named La Sierra Nevada, because of their perpetual snows. On the\r\nfifth day out he passed the Boca de la Sierpe. Men who went on board\r\nhis brigantine told him that Hojeda had returned to Hispaniola, but\r\nthinking they lied, Enciso ordered them by virtue of his authority\r\nas a judge, to return to the country whence they had come. They\r\nobediently followed Enciso, but nevertheless implored him at least to\r\ngrant them the favour of allowing them to return to Hispaniola or to\r\nconduct them himself to Nicuesa, promising in exchange for his good\r\nservices twenty-six drachmas of gold; for though they were in want of\r\nbread, they were rich in gold. Enciso was deaf to their entreaties,\r\nand affirmed that it was impossible for him to land anywhere but at\r\nUraba, the province of Hojeda, and it was thither, guided by them,\r\nthat he directed his course.\r\n\r\nListen, however, to what happened to this judge, and perhaps, Most\r\nHoly Father, you will find it worth remembering. Enciso anchored off\r\nthe coast of Caramairiana in the harbour of Carthagena, celebrated for\r\nthe chastity and grace of its women, and the courage of both sexes of\r\nthe inhabitants. As he approached to renew his supply of water and to\r\nrepair the ship's boat, which had been damaged, he ordered some men to\r\nland. They were at once surrounded by a multitude of natives, all of\r\nwhom were armed and who, for three days, watched their labours most\r\nattentively, fairly besieging them. During this time neither the\r\nSpaniards nor the natives engaged in hostilities, although they\r\nremained face to face during three entire days, both on their guard\r\nand watching one another. The Spaniards continued their work, the\r\nsoldiers protecting the carpenters.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of suspense, two Spaniards went to fill a vessel\r\nwith water at the river's mouth, and, more quickly than I can write\r\nit, a native chief and ten soldiers surrounded them, pointing their\r\narrows on them but not shooting, contenting themselves with glaring\r\nat them ferociously. One of the Spaniards fled, but the other stood\r\ntrembling in his tracks, and by invectives called back his companion.\r\nHe spoke to the enemy in their own tongue, which he had learned from\r\none of the captives captured elsewhere, and they, surprised at hearing\r\ntheir language in the mouth of a stranger, were mollified and answered\r\nwith gentle words. The soldier assured them that he and his friends\r\nwere merely strangers passing through, and he was astonished that they\r\ndrove the ships from the coast, along which they were sailing. He\r\naccused them of inhumanity, and threatened them with dire misfortunes\r\ndid they not abandon their design; for he assured them that unless\r\nthey not only laid down their arms but received the Spaniards with\r\nhonour, other armed strangers, more numerous than the sands, would\r\narrive and ravage their country. Enciso was informed that two soldiers\r\nhad been seized by natives, but suspecting a trap he ordered his\r\nsoldiers to carry their shields to protect themeselves from the\r\npoisoned arrows and, hastily forming them in order of battle, he led\r\nthem towards those who held the prisoners. A sign from the soldier,\r\nbegging him to stop, caused him to call a halt, and, at the same time,\r\nthe other soldier whom he summoned told him that everything was going\r\non well and that the Indians desired peace, since they had discovered\r\nthat they were not the men who had sacked the village on the opposite\r\ncoast, destroyed and burned another village in the interior, and\r\ncarried off prisoners. This alluded to Hojeda's troops. The natives\r\nhad come intending to avenge this outrage, but they had no intention\r\nof attacking innocent men, for they declared it was infamous to attack\r\nanyone who did not attack them. The natives laid down their bows and\r\narrows, and received the Spaniards amicably, giving them salted fish\r\nand bread. They also filled their barrels with a certain brew made\r\nfrom native fruits and grain, which was almost as good as wine.\r\n\r\nAfter concluding a peace with the people of Caramairi who, in response\r\nto the summons of their cacique, assembled in a great crowd, Enciso\r\nleft for Uraba, passing by the island La Fuerte. He had one hundred\r\nand fifty new soldiers on his ship, to replace those who were dead. He\r\ncarried twelve horses and swine, both male and female, for propagating\r\nthe species in that region. He was provided with fifty cannon and a\r\ngood supply of lances, shields, swords, and other fighting material.\r\nNothing, however, of all he brought saw service; for as he was about\r\nto enter the port, the captain of the ship who was acting as pilot,\r\ndrove it upon a sandy reef and the unfortunate vessel was overwhelmed\r\nby the waves, and shattered. Its entire contents were lost. What a\r\npitiful sight! Of all the provisions they only saved twelve barrels\r\nof flour, a few cheeses, and a small quantity of biscuit. All their\r\nanimals were drowned, and the men, almost naked, with some of their\r\nweapons, were saved by the brigantine and the ship's boat. Thus from\r\none misfortune to another they were reduced to extreme peril of their\r\nlives, and thought no more about gold.\r\n\r\nBehold them, therefore, alive and safe in view of the land they had\r\ndesired with their whole hearts. It was necessary, first of all, to\r\nfind some means of subsistence, for men do not live on air, and as\r\nthey had nothing of their own, they took what belonged to others. One\r\nhappy resource lightened their misfortunes; for they found a palm\r\ngrove not far from the coast, between which and the neighbouring\r\nswamps there wandered herds of wild swine. They lived, therefore, for\r\nsome time on the flesh of these animals, which are said to be smaller\r\nthan ours and have such a short tail it appears to have been cut off.\r\nTheir feet are also different from those of our wild boars, for the\r\nhind feet have only one toe and no hoof. Their flesh is much more\r\nsucculent and wholesome than that of our wild boars.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards likewise ate fruits and roots of a variety of palms,\r\ncalled cabbage palms, such as are eaten in the interior of Andalusia,\r\nand of whose leaves brooms are made in Rome. Besides this they found\r\nother fruits in the country, though most of them, even the plums, were\r\nnot yet ripe and were somewhat hard and red in colour. I assume that\r\nthese were the variety I ate in the month of April in Alexandria,\r\nwhere they grew on trees, which the Jews, who are versed in the Mosaic\r\nlaw, claim to be the cedar of Lebanon. They are edible and sweet\r\nthough not without a trace of bitterness, resembling the fruit of\r\ncrab-apple trees. The natives plant this tree in their gardens in\r\nplace of peach, cherry, and other similar trees, and cultivate it with\r\nthe greatest care. In size, the character of its trunk and its leaves,\r\nit closely resembles the jujube tree.\r\n\r\nWhen the wild boar gave out, the Spaniards were obliged to take\r\nthought for the future, so they marched their troops into the\r\ninterior. The inhabitants of Caribana country are very skilful in the\r\nuse of bows and arrows. The troop of Enciso consisted of a body of a\r\nhundred men.[7] They encountered three naked savages who, without the\r\nslightest fear, attacked them. The natives wounded four with poisoned\r\narrows and killed some others, after which, their quivers being\r\nexhausted, they fled with the rapidity of the wind, for they are\r\nextremely agile. In their flight they hurled insults at the Spaniards,\r\nand they never shot an arrow that failed to hit its mark. Much\r\ndepressed and inclined to abandon the country, the Spaniards returned\r\nto their point of departure, where they found the natives had\r\ndestroyed the blockhouse built by Hojeda, and burned the village\r\nof thirty houses as soon as Francisco Pizarro and his companions,\r\ndeserted by Hojeda, abandoned it.\r\n\r\n[Note 7: The text continues somewhat irrelevantly: _dico centum\r\npedites, etsi me non lateat constare centuriam ex centum viginti\r\nocto militibus, ut decuriam ex quindecim. Licet tamen de gente nuda\r\nscribenti, nudis uti verbis interdum_.]\r\n\r\nTheir exploration of the country convinced the Spaniards that the\r\neastern part of Uraba was richer and more fertile than the western.\r\nThey therefore divided their forces and, with the assistance of a\r\nbrigantine, transported one half of their people thither, the other\r\nhalf remaining on the eastern coast. The gulf is twenty-four miles\r\nlong, growing narrower as it penetrates inland. Many rivers flow into\r\nthe Gulf of Uraba, one of which, called the Darien,[8] they say, is\r\nmore fortunate than the Nile.\r\n\r\n[Note 8: The name _Darien_ applies to the eastern part of the\r\nisthmus of Panama, extending from the Gulf of San Miguel to that of\r\nUraba. The river bearing the same name forms a large estuary in the\r\nGulf of San Miguel.]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards decided to settle upon its green banks where fruit trees\r\ngrow. The river bed is narrow and its current sluggish. The people\r\nalong the banks were much amazed to see the brigantine, so much larger\r\nthan their own barques, under full sail. Getting rid of their women\r\nand non-fighting men, and donning their fighting equipment, about five\r\nhundred of them advanced against the Spaniards, taking up a position\r\nupon a lofty hillock. The Spaniards, commanded by Enciso, who was\r\njudge in the name of Hojeda, prepared for the conflict. First\r\nkneeling, general and soldiers together prayed God to give them the\r\nvictory. They bound themselves by a vow to make votive offerings of\r\ngold and silver to the statue of the Blessed Virgin, known in Seville\r\nby the name of Santa Maria della Antigua, vowing to make a pilgrimage\r\nto her sanctuary, to name in her honour the village they might found,\r\nand to build a church sacred to her or to transform the house of the\r\ncacique into a church. They also took a vow not to retreat before the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nAt a given signal they cheerfully armed themselves; carrying their\r\nshields on their left arms, brandishing their halberds, they charged\r\nupon the enemy who, being naked, could not resist the attack for long,\r\nand consequently fled, their cacique, Zemaco, at their head. Promptly\r\ntaking possession of the village, our men found an abundance of native\r\nfood and assuaged their immediate hunger. There was bread made of\r\nroots and bread made of grain, such as we have described in our first\r\nbook; also fruits bearing no resemblance to any of ours and which they\r\npreserve, much as we do chestnuts and similar fruits.\r\n\r\nThe men of this country go naked, the women cover the middle of their\r\nbody with cotton draperies from the navel downwards. Winter's rigours\r\nare unknown. The mouth of the Darien is only eight degrees distant\r\nfrom the equator, thus the difference in length between night and day\r\nis hardly noticeable. Although the natives are ignorant of astronomy\r\nthey had remarked this fact. Moreover, it is of small importance\r\nwhether these measures are or are not different from those they give,\r\nfor in any case the differences are insignificant.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the Spaniards ascended the river and about a mile\r\ndistant they found very dense forests and woods, in which they\r\nsuspected the natives were either hiding or had their treasure\r\nconcealed. They searched the thickets carefully; keeping always\r\non their guard against a surprise they moved under cover of their\r\nshields. Nobody was found in the thickets, but there was a quantity of\r\ngold and effects, coverlets woven of silk and of cotton, such as the\r\nItalians call _bombasio_ and the Spanish _algodon_; utensils, both\r\nof wood and terra-cotta, gold and copper ornaments and necklaces,\r\namounting in all to about one hundred and two pounds. The natives\r\nprocure these gold necklaces, which they themselves work with great\r\ncare, in exchange for their own products, for it usually happens that\r\na country rich in cereals is devoid of gold. On the other hand, where\r\ngold and other metals are common, the country is usually mountainous,\r\nrocky, and arid; it is by exchanging products that commercial\r\nrelations are established. The Spaniards derived satisfaction and\r\nencouragement from two sources: they had found plenty of gold, and\r\nchance had led them into an agreeable and fertile region. They\r\nimmediately summoned their companions, who had been left on the\r\neastern shore of the Gulf of Uraba, to join them. Nevertheless, some\r\npeople allege that the climate is not very healthy, since the country\r\nconsists of a deep valley, surrounded by mountains and swamps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are aware, Most Holy Father, of where those Spaniards under the\r\ncommand of Hojeda had resolved to settle, having received from the\r\nSpanish sovereigns authorisation to colonise the vast regions of\r\nUraba. Leaving for a moment these colonists let us return to Nicuesa,\r\nwho was in command of the great province of Veragua.\r\n\r\nI have already related how he had overstepped the limits of the\r\njurisdiction of his partner and friend Hojeda, and had sailed with one\r\ncaravel and two brigantines for Veragua. The largest of these vessels\r\nhad been left behind with orders to follow him, but this proved a most\r\nunfortunate inspiration, for Nicuesa lost sight of his companions\r\nin the darkness and, sailing too far, went beyond the mouths of the\r\nVeragua for which he was looking. Lopez de Olano, a Catalonian, who\r\nwas in command of one of the largest of the vessels, learned from the\r\nnatives while he followed in the track of Nicuesa that his commander\r\nhad left the Gulf of Veragua to the east. He therefore promptly turned\r\nabout and sailed to meet the commander of another brigantine which had\r\nlikewise got out of its course during the night. This brigantine was\r\ncommanded by Pedro de Umbria. Rejoicing at thus meeting, the two\r\ncaptains consulted as to what they should do, trying to imagine what\r\ncourse Nicuesa could have taken. On reflection they thought that he\r\n(Nicuesa), being chief commander of the expedition, must have had\r\ndifferent indications concerning the exact location of Veragua than\r\nthey, who were simple volunteers, and only sought to rejoin their\r\nleader. They laid their course towards Veragua, and at a distance of\r\nsixteen miles found a river, discovered by Columbus and called by him\r\nLos Lagartos, because a number of these animals, called in Spanish\r\n_lagartos_, in Latin _lacertos_[1] were found there. These creatures\r\nare as dangerous to men and to other animals as are the crocodiles of\r\nthe Nile. At that place they met their companions who had anchored\r\ntheir large vessels after receiving the leader's orders to proceed.\r\nMuch disturbed by the possible consequences of Nicuesa's blunder, the\r\nships' captains consulted together and decided to adopt the opinion of\r\nthe captains of the brigantines which had coasted along very near to\r\nthe shores of Veragua; they therefore sailed for that port. Veragua is\r\na local name given to a river which has rich gold deposits; and from\r\nthe river, the name extends to the entire region. The large vessels\r\nanchored at the mouth of the river and landed all the provisions by\r\nmeans of the ships' boats. Lopez de Olano was chosen governor in place\r\nof Nicuesa who was thought to be lost.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: Lizards, by which are doubtless meant alligators.]\r\n\r\nActing upon the advice of Lopez and other officers, the ships rendered\r\nuseless by age were abandoned to be destroyed by the waves; this\r\ndecision was likewise adopted to encourage serious projects of\r\ncolonisation by cutting off all hope of escape. With the more solid\r\ntimbers and with beams cut from the trees, which in that neighbourhood\r\nsometimes attain an extraordinary height and size, the Spaniards built\r\na new caravel to provide for unforeseen wants.\r\n\r\nWhen the captain of one of the brigantines, Pedro de Umbria, reached\r\nVeragua, a catastrophe befell. Being a man of irritable disposition,\r\nhe resolved to separate from his companions and seek a region where he\r\nmight establish himself independently. He selected twelve sailors and\r\ndeparted in the largest ship's boat belonging to one of the greater\r\nvessels. The tide rolls in on that coast with as dreadful roarings as\r\nthose which are described as prevailing at Scylla in Sicily, dashing\r\nthemselves against the rocks projecting into the sea, from which they\r\nare thrown back with great violence, causing an agitation which the\r\nSpaniards call _resacca_.[2] Umbria's boat was caught in a whirlpool\r\nlike a mountain torrent which, despite his efforts, dashed him into\r\nthe sea and sunk his barque before the eyes of his companions. Only\r\none Spaniard, who was a skilful swimmer, succeeded in saving himself\r\nby clutching a rock which rose slightly above the waters, and there\r\nheld out against the raging tempest. The next day when the sea had\r\nabated and the tide had left the reef dry, he rejoined his companions,\r\nand the eleven others perished. The other Spaniards did not venture to\r\ntake to their barques but landed direct from the brigantines.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Meaning the undertow of surf.]\r\n\r\nAfter a stop of a few days they ascended the river, and found some\r\nnative villages, called in the language of the country _mumu_. They\r\nset to work to construct a fort on the bank, and as the country round\r\nabout seemed sterile, they sowed, as in Europe, a valley of which the\r\nsoil seemed apt for cultivation. While these things were happening in\r\nVeragua, one of the Spaniards, who was stationed on a high rock which\r\nserved as a lookout, casting his eyes to the west, cried \"A sail! a\r\nsail!\" As the ship approached it was seen to be a barque under full\r\nsail. The newcomers were joyfully welcomed. The boat turned out to be\r\na barque belonging to the caravel of Nicuesa, which could only carry\r\nfive persons; but as a matter of fact there were only three men on\r\nboard. These men had stolen the barque because Nicuesa had refused to\r\nbelieve them when they assured him that he had passed beyond Veragua,\r\nleaving that place behind him to the east. Seeing that Nicuesa and his\r\nmen were perishing of hunger, they resolved to try their fortunes in\r\nthat barque, and to attempt to discover Veragua by themselves, and\r\nthey had succeeded. They described Nicuesa as wandering aimlessly,\r\nafter having lost his caravel in a storm, and that he was practically\r\nlost among salt marshes and desert coasts, being destitute of\r\neverything and reduced to a most miserable plight, since for seventy\r\ndays he had eaten nothing but herbs and roots and drunk nothing but\r\nwater, of which indeed he had not always enough. This all came about\r\nbecause, in seeking Veragua, he persisted in his course towards the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nThe country had already been reconnoitred by that great discoverer\r\nof vast regions, Christopher Columbus, who had given it the name of\r\n_Gracias à Dios_; in the native tongue it was called _Cerabaro_. The\r\nriver which the Spaniards call San Mateo divides it into two portions,\r\nand it is distant about one hundred and thirty miles from western\r\nVeragua. I do not give the native names of this river or of other\r\nlocalities, because the explorers who have returned to Spain do not\r\nthemselves know them. The report of these three sailors prompted Pedro\r\nde Olano, one of Nicuesa's two captains and his deputy judge, to send\r\none of the brigantines piloted by the same sailors, to find and bring\r\nback Nicuesa. Upon his arrival, Nicuesa ordered Olano, who had been\r\nappointed governor pending his return, to be put into irons, and\r\nimprisoned, accusing him of treason for having usurped the authority\r\nof governor and not having concerned himself sufficiently, while\r\nenjoying the command, about the disappearance of his chief. He\r\nlikewise accused him of negligence in sending so late to search for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn like manner Nicuesa reproached everybody in arrogant terms, and\r\nwithin a few days he commanded that they should make ready to depart.\r\nThe colonists begged him not to decide hastily, and to wait at least\r\nuntil the crops that they had sown were harvested, as the harvesting\r\nseason was now at hand. Four months had now passed since they had\r\nsown. Nicuesa refused to listen to anything, declaring they must leave\r\nsuch an unfortunate country as quickly as possible. He therefore\r\ncarried off everything that had been landed at the Gulf of Veragua,\r\nand ordered the ships to sail towards the east. After sailing sixteen\r\nmiles a young Genoese, called Gregorio, recognised the vicinity of\r\na certain harbour, to prove which he declared that they would find\r\nburied in the sand an anchor which had been abandoned there, and under\r\na tree near to the harbour, a spring of clear water. Upon landing they\r\nfound the anchor and the spring, and gave thanks for the excellent\r\nmemory of Gregorio, who, alone amongst the numerous sailors who had\r\nsailed these seas together with Columbus, remembered anything about\r\nthese particulars. Columbus had named this place Porto Bello.\r\n\r\nHunger induced them to land at several places, and everywhere their\r\nreception by the natives was hostile. The Spaniards were now reduced\r\nby famine to such a state of weakness that they could no longer fight\r\nagainst natives, even naked ones, who offered the least resistance.\r\nTwenty of them died from wounds of poisoned arrows. It was decided to\r\nleave one half of the company at Porto Bello, and with the other half\r\nNicuesa continued his voyage eastwards. Twenty-eight miles from Porto\r\nBello and near a cape which Columbus had formerly called Marmor, he\r\ndecided to found a fort, but the want of food had too much reduced\r\nthe strength of his men to permit this labour. Nicuesa nevertheless\r\nerected a small tower, sufficient to withstand the first attacks of\r\nthe natives, which he called Nombre de Dios. From the day he had left\r\nVeragua, not only during his march across the sandy plains but also\r\nbecause of the famine which prevailed while he was constructing the\r\ntower, he lost two hundred of the men who still survived. Thus it was\r\nthat, little by little, his numerous company of seven hundred and\r\neighty-five men was reduced to about one hundred.\r\n\r\nWhile Nicuesa, with a handful of wretched creatures, struggled in\r\nthis manner against ill fortune, rivalry for the command broke out in\r\nUraba. A certain Vasco Nuñez Balboa[3] who, in the opinion of most\r\npeople, was a man of action rather than of judgment, stirred up\r\nhis companions against the judge Enciso, declaring that the latter\r\npossessed no royal patents giving him judicial powers. The fact of his\r\nbeing chosen by Hojeda to act as governor was not enough. He succeeded\r\nin impeding Enciso in his functions, and the colonists of Uraba chose\r\nsome of their own men to administer the colony; but dissension was not\r\nlong in dividing them, especially when their leader Hojeda did not\r\nreturn. They thought the latter dead, of his wound, and disputed among\r\nthemselves as to whether they should not summon Nicuesa to take his\r\nplace. Some influential members of the council who had been friends of\r\nNicuesa and could not endure the insolence of Vasco Nuñez thought they\r\nought to scour the country in search of Nicuesa; for they had heard it\r\nreported that he had abandoned Uraba on account of the barrenness of\r\nthe soil. Possibly he was wandering in unknown places like Enciso and\r\nother victims of wrecks; therefore they should not rest until they had\r\ndiscovered whether he and his associates still lived.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: Balboa was of a noble family of Xeres de los Caballeros,\r\nand was born in 1475. He came to Hispaniola in 1500, where he suffered\r\nextreme poverty. He went on board Enciso's vessel as a stowaway.]\r\n\r\nVasco Nuñez, who feared to be deposed from his command on the arrival\r\nof Nicuesa, treated those who still believed that the latter lived, as\r\nfoolish. Moreover, even were the fact proven, they had no need of him,\r\nfor did they not possess as good a title as Nicuesa? Opinions were\r\nthus divided, when the captain of two large vessels, Roderigo de\r\nColmenares, arrived bringing a reinforcement of sixty men, a quantity\r\nof foodstuffs, and clothing.\r\n\r\nI must recount some particulars of the voyage of Colmenares. It was\r\nabout the ides of October in the year 1510 that Colmenares sailed from\r\nBeata, the port of Hispaniola, where expeditions are usually fitted\r\nout. The nones of November he reached the coast of that immense\r\ncountry of Paria, between the port of Carthagena and the district of\r\nCuchibacoa, discovered by Columbus. He suffered equally during this\r\nvoyage from the attacks of the natives and from the fury of the sea.\r\nBeing short of water, he stopped at the mouth of the river called by\r\nthe natives Gaira, which was large enough for his ships to enter. This\r\nriver has different sources on a lofty snow-covered mountain, which\r\nRoderigo's companions declared to be the highest they had ever seen.\r\nThis statement must be true, since the snow lay upon a mountain which\r\nis not more than ten degrees distant from the equator. A shallop was\r\nsent ashore at the Gaira to fill the water barrels, and while the\r\nsailors were engaged in this task they saw a cacique accompanied by\r\ntwenty of his people approaching. Strange to behold, he was dressed in\r\ncotton clothing, and a cloak, held in place by a band, fell from\r\nhis shoulders to the elbow. He also wore another trailing tunic of\r\nfeminine design. The cacique advanced and amicably advised our men\r\nnot to take water at that particular place, because it was of poor\r\nquality; he showed them close at hand another river of which the\r\nwaters were more wholesome. The Spaniards repaired to the river\r\nindicated by the cacique, but were prevented by the bad state of the\r\nsea from finding its bottom, for the sands fairly bubbled as it were,\r\nwhich indicated that the sea was full of reefs. They were obliged,\r\ntherefore, to come back to the first river, where at least they could\r\nsafely anchor. Here the cacique disclosed his treacherous intentions,\r\nfor while our men were engaged in filling their barrels, he fell\r\nupon them, followed by seven hundred naked men, armed in the native\r\nfashion, only he and his officers wearing clothing. He seized the\r\nbarque, which he smashed to pieces, and in a twinkling the forty-seven\r\nSpaniards were pierced with arrow-wounds, before they could protect\r\nthemselves with their shields. There was but one man who survived, all\r\nthe rest perishing from the effects of the poison. No remedy against\r\nthis kind of poison was then known, and it was only later that the\r\nislanders of Hispaniola revealed it; for there exists an herb in\r\nHispaniola of which the juice, if administered in time, counteracts\r\nthe poison of the arrows. Seven other Spaniards escaped the massacre,\r\nand took refuge in the trunk of a gigantic tree hollowed by age, where\r\nthey concealed themselves till night. But they did not for that reason\r\nescape, for at nightfall the ship of Colmenares sailed away, leaving\r\nthem to their fate, and it is not known what became of them.\r\n\r\nLest I should weary you if I related all the particulars, Most Holy\r\nFather, I omit mention of the thousand perilous adventures through\r\nwhich Colmenares finally reached the Gulf of Uraba. He anchored off\r\nthe eastern coast, which is sterile, and from that point he rejoined\r\nhis compatriots on the opposite bank several days later. The silence\r\neverywhere amazed him; for he had expected to find his comrades in\r\nthose parts. Mystified by this state of things, he wondered whether\r\nthe Spaniards were still alive or whether they had settled elsewhere;\r\nand he chose an excellent means for obtaining information. He loaded\r\nall his cannon and mortars to the muzzle with bullets and powder, and\r\nhe ordered fires to be lighted on the tops of the hills. The cannon\r\nwere all fired together, and their tremendous detonation made the very\r\nearth about the Gulf of Uraba shake. Although they were twenty-four\r\nmiles distant, which is the width of the gulf, the Spaniards heard the\r\nnoise, and seeing the flames they replied by similar fires. Guided\r\nby these lights Colmenares ordered his ships to cross to the western\r\nshore. The colonists of Darien were in a miserable plight, and after\r\nthe shipwreck of the judge Enciso it was only by the greatest efforts\r\nthey had managed to exist. With hands raised to heaven and eyes\r\noverflowing with tears of mingled joy and sadness, they welcomed\r\nColmenares and his companions with what enthusiasm their wretched\r\nstate allowed. Food and clothing were distributed to them, since they\r\nwere almost naked. It only remains, Most Holy Father, to describe the\r\ninternal dissensions which broke out among the colonists of Uraba over\r\nthe succession to the command, after they had lost their leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief colonists of Uraba and all the friends of order decided to\r\nrecall Nicuesa from wherever he was, and as the judge, Enciso, was\r\nopposed to this measure, they deprived him of the brigantine he had\r\nbuilt at his own expense. Contrary to his will and against that of\r\nVasco Nuñez, the adventurer, they decided to go in search of Nicuesa\r\nin order that he might settle the dispute about the commandership.\r\nColmenares, whom I have mentioned above, was commanded to search along\r\nthose coasts where it was thought Nicuesa wandered abandoned. It was\r\nknown that the latter had left Veragua, because of the sterility of\r\nthe soil. The colonists instructed Colmenares to bring Nicuesa back as\r\nsoon as he could find him and to assure him they would be grateful to\r\nhim if, on his arrival, he succeeded in calming the dissensions which\r\nrent the colony. Colmenares accepted this mission, for he was a\r\npersonal friend of Nicuesa, and boldly announced that the provisions\r\nhe had brought were intended as much for Nicuesa as for the colonists\r\nof Uraba. He, therefore, fitted out one of his ships and the\r\nbrigantine, which had been taken from Enciso, loading them with a\r\npart of the provisions he had brought. He coasted carefully along the\r\nneighbouring shores, and finally came upon Nicuesa engaged in building\r\nhis tower on Cape Marmor.\r\n\r\nNicuesa was the most wretched of men, reduced to a skeleton, covered\r\nwith rags. There remained barely sixty of the seven hundred and more\r\ncompanions who had started with him, and the survivors were more to\r\nbe pitied than the dead. Colmenares comforted his friend Nicuesa,\r\nembracing him with tears, cheering him with words of hope for a change\r\nof fortune and speedy success. He reminded him that the best element\r\nof the colonists of Uraba wished for his return, because his authority\r\nalone could quiet the dissensions which raged. Thanking his friend, as\r\nbecame the situation, Nicuesa sailed with him for Uraba.\r\n\r\nIt is a common thing to observe amongst men that arrogance accompanies\r\nsuccess. After having wept and sighed and poured out complaints for\r\nhis miseries, after having overwhelmed his rescuer, Colmenares, with\r\nthanks and almost rolled at his feet, Nicuesa, when the fear of\r\nstarvation was removed, began, even before he had seen the colonists\r\nof Uraba, to talk airily of his projects of reform and his intention\r\nto get possession of all the gold there was. He said that no one had\r\nthe right to keep back any of the gold, without his authorisation, or\r\nthat of his associate Hojeda. These imprudent words reached the ears\r\nof the colonists of Uraba, and roused against Nicuesa the indignation\r\nof the partisans of Enciso, Hojeda's deputy judge, and that of Nuñez.\r\nIt therefore fell out that Nicuesa, with sixty companions, had\r\nhardly landed, so it is reported, before the colonists forced him to\r\nre-embark, overwhelming him with threats. The better intentioned of\r\nthe colonists were displeased at this demonstration, but fearing a\r\nrising of the majority headed by Vasco Nuñez, they did not interfere.\r\nNicuesa was therefore obliged to regain the brigantine, and there\r\nremained with him only seventeen of his sixty companions. It was the\r\ncalends of March in the year 1511 when Nicuesa set sail, intending to\r\nreturn to Hispaniola and there complain of the usurpation of Vasco\r\nNuñez and the violent treatment offered the judge, Enciso.\r\n\r\nHe sailed in an evil hour and no news was ever again heard of that\r\nbrigantine. It is believed the vessel sank, and that all the men were\r\ndrowned. However that may be, Nicuesa plunged from one calamity into\r\nanother, and died even more miserably than he had lived.\r\n\r\nAfter the shameful expulsion of Nicuesa, the colonists consumed the\r\nprovisions Colmenares had brought, and soon, driven by hunger, they\r\nwere forced to plunder the neighbourhood of the colony like wolves of\r\nthe forest. A troop of about one hundred and thirty men was formed\r\nunder the leadership of Vasco Nuñez, who organised them like a band\r\nof brigands. Puffed up by vanity, he sent a guard in advance, and had\r\nothers to accompany and follow him. He chose Colmenares[1] as his\r\nassociate and companion. From the outset of this expedition he\r\ndetermined to seize everything he could find in the territory of the\r\nneighbouring caciques, and he began by marching along the shore of\r\nthe district of Coiba, of which we have already spoken. Summoning the\r\ncacique of that district, Careca, of whom the Spaniards had never had\r\nreason to complain, he haughtily and threateningly ordered him to\r\nfurnish provisions for his men. The cacique Careca answered that it\r\nwas impossible, because he had already at different times helped\r\nthe Christians and consequently his own provisions were well-nigh\r\nexhausted. Moreover, in consequence of a long-drawn-out war with a\r\nneighbouring cacique called Poncha, he was himself reduced to want.\r\nThe adventurer admitted none of these reasons, and the wretched Careca\r\nsaw his town sacked. He himself was put in irons and brought with his\r\ntwo wives, his sons and all his familia to Darien.[2] In the house of\r\nCareca they found three of Nicuesa's companions, who, when his ships\r\nwere at anchor, during his search for Veragua, had deserted him\r\nbecause they feared to be tried for certain crimes. As soon as the\r\nfleet sailed away, they took refuge with Careca who received them\r\namicably. Eighteen months had elapsed since that time, so they were\r\nas naked as the natives, but plump as the capons women fatten in dark\r\nplaces, for they had lived well at the cacique's table during that\r\nperiod; nor did they concern themselves about _meum_ and _tuum_, or\r\nas to who gave and who received, which is the cause of the crimes of\r\nviolence that shorten human life.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: The memoir of Colmenares on this expedition is contained\r\nin Navarrete's _Coleccion de Viajes_, tom. iii., pp. 386-393. Also\r\nBalboa's letter to King Ferdinand in the same volume.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Balboa's description of his treatment of the natives,\r\nwhich he penned to the King, is just the contrary. He prides himself\r\non having won their friendship, and ascribes to their affection for\r\nhim his success in discovering the treasures and secrets of the\r\ncountry.]\r\n\r\nThese Spaniards nevertheless preferred to return to a life of\r\nhardship. Provisions were brought from the village of Careca to the\r\npeople left behind at Darien, for the first consideration was to stave\r\noff the famine that was imminent. Whether before or afterwards I am\r\nnot certain, but in any event it was shortly after the expulsion of\r\nNicuesa that quarrels broke out between the judge, Enciso, and Vasco\r\nNuñez, each being supported by his own partisans. Enciso was seized,\r\nthrown into prison, and all his goods sold at auction. It was alleged\r\nthat he had usurped judicial functions never granted him by the King\r\nbut merely by Hojeda, who was supposed to be dead, and Vasco Nuñez\r\ndeclared that he would not obey a man on whom the King had not\r\nconferred authority by a royal patent. He allowed himself, however, to\r\nbe influenced by the entreaties of the better colonists and modified\r\nhis severity, even releasing Enciso from his chains and permitting him\r\nto go on board a ship which would carry him to Hispaniola. Before the\r\nvessel sailed, some of the better people of the colony sought out\r\nEnciso and implored him to come on shore again, promising to effect a\r\nreconciliation with Vasco Nuñez and to reinstate him in his position\r\nof judge. Enciso refused and left; nor are there wanting people who\r\nwhispered that God and His Saints had themselves shaped events to\r\npunish Enciso for Nicuesa's expulsion, which he had counselled.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, these discoverers of new countries ruined and\r\nexhausted themselves by their own folly and civil strife, failing\r\nabsolutely to rise to the greatness expected of men who accomplish\r\nsuch wonderful things. Meanwhile it was decided by common agreement\r\namong the colonists to send their representatives to the young\r\nAdmiral,[3] son and heir of Columbus, the first discoverer, who was\r\nviceroy of Hispaniola, and to the other government officials of the\r\nisland. These envoys were to solicit reinforcements and a code of laws\r\nfor the new colonies. They were to explain the true situation, the\r\nactual poverty of the colonists, the discoveries already made, and all\r\nthat might still be hoped for, if the officials would only send them\r\nsupplies. Vasco Nuñez chose for this office one of his adherents,\r\nValdivia, the same who had prosecuted the suit against Enciso.\r\nAssociated with him was a Catalonian, called Zamudio. It was agreed\r\nthat Valdivia should return with provisions from Hispaniola, when his\r\nmission was accomplished, and that Zamudio should proceed to Spain\r\nand see the King. Both left the same time as Enciso, but it was the\r\nlatter's intention to present a memorial to the King contradicting the\r\nrepresentations of Valdivia and Zamudio. Both these men came to see me\r\nat Court, and I will elsewhere recount what they told me.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: Diego, son of Christopher Columbus and his wife, Doña\r\nMoñiz de Perestrello. He was married to Doña Maria de Toledo.]\r\n\r\nDuring this time the wretched colonists of Darien liberated the\r\ncacique of Coiba, Careca, and even agreed to serve as his allies\r\nduring a campaign against the cacique called Poncha, who was a\r\nneighbour of Careca on the continent. Careca agreed to supply the\r\nSpaniards with food, and to join them with his family and subjects.\r\nThe only arms these natives used were bows and poisoned arrows, as we\r\nhave already described was the case amongst those in the eastern part\r\nbeyond the gulf. As they have no iron, they use in hand-to-hand combat\r\nlong wooden swords, which they call _machanas_. They likewise use\r\npointed sticks hardened in the fire, bone-tipped javelins, and other\r\nprojectiles. The campaign with Poncha began immediately after they had\r\nsown their fields as well as they could. Careca acted both as guide\r\nand commander of the vanguard. When his town was attacked Poncha\r\nfled, and the village and its surroundings were sacked. Thanks to the\r\ncacique's provisions, nothing was to be feared from hunger, but none\r\nof these supplies could be taken to the colonists who remained behind,\r\nfor the distance between Darien and Poncha's village was more than a\r\nhundred miles, and everything had to be carried on men's backs to the\r\nnearest coast where the ships, which had been brought by the Spaniards\r\nto Careca's village, were lying. A few pounds of wrought gold, in the\r\nform of divers necklaces, were obtained; after ruining Poncha, the\r\nSpaniards returned to their ships, deciding to leave the caciques of\r\nthe interior in peace and to confine their attacks to those along the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nNot far distant, in the same direction from Coiba, lies a country\r\ncalled Comogra, whose cacique is named Comogre, and against him the\r\nSpaniards delivered their next attack. His town stands at the foot of\r\nthe other side of the neighbouring mountain chain, in a fertile plain\r\nsome twelve leagues in extent. A relative of one of Careca's principal\r\nofficers, who had quarrelled with him, had taken refuge with Comogre.\r\nThis man was called Jura, and acted as intermediary between the\r\nSpaniards and Comogre, whose friendship he secured for them. Jura was\r\nvery well known to the Spaniards ever since Nicuesa's expedition,\r\nand it was he who had received those three deserters from Nicuesa's\r\ncompany in his own house during their stay. When peace was concluded,\r\nthe Spaniards repaired to the palace of Comogre, which lies some\r\nthirty leagues distant from Darien, but not in a direct line, for the\r\nintervening mountains obliged them to make long detours. Comogre had\r\nseven sons from different women, all handsome children or young men,\r\nwearing no clothes. His palace was formed of beams cut from the trees,\r\nand securely fastened together. It was further strengthened by stone\r\nwalls. The Spaniards estimated the dimensions of this palace at one\r\nhundred and fifty paces the length and eighty paces the breadth. Its\r\nceilings were carved and the floors were artistically decorated. They\r\nnoticed a storehouse filled with native provisions of the country,\r\nand a cellar stacked with earthenware barrels and wooden kegs, as in\r\nSpain, or Italy. These receptacles contained excellent wine, not of\r\nthe kind made from grapes, for they have no vineyards, but such as\r\nthey make from three kinds of roots and the grain they use for making\r\nbread, called, as we have said in our first book, yucca, ages, and\r\nmaize; they likewise use the fruit of the palm-trees. The Germans,\r\nFlemings and English, as well as the Spanish mountaineers in the\r\nBasque provinces and the Asturias, and the Austrians, Swabians, and\r\nSwiss in the Alps make beer from barley, wheat, and fruits in the same\r\nmanner. The Spaniards report that at Comogra they drank white and red\r\nwines of different flavours.\r\n\r\nAttend now, Sovereign Pontiff, to another and horrifying sight. Upon\r\nentering the cacique's inner apartments the Spaniards found a room\r\nfilled with bodies suspended in cotton ropes. They inquired the motive\r\nof this superstitious custom, and were informed that they were the\r\nbodies of the ancestors of Comogre, which were preserved with great\r\ncare, according to the rank they had occupied in life; respect for the\r\ndead being part of their religion. Golden masks decorated with stones\r\nwere placed upon their faces, just as ancient families rendered homage\r\nto the _Penates_. In my first book I explained how they dry these\r\nbodies by stretching them on grid-irons with a slow fire beneath, in\r\nsuch a way that they are reduced to skin and bone.\r\n\r\nThe eldest of the seven sons of Comogre was a young man of\r\nextraordinary intelligence. In his opinion it was wiser to treat those\r\nSpanish vagabonds kindly, and to avoid furnishing them any pretext\r\nfor the violent acts they had committed on neighbouring tribes. He\r\ntherefore presented four thousand drachmas of wrought gold and seventy\r\nslaves to Vasco Nuñez and Colmenares, as they were the leaders.\r\nThese natives sell and exchange whatever articles they need amongst\r\nthemselves, and have no money. The Spaniards were engaged in the\r\nvestibule of Comogre, weighing his gold and another almost equal\r\nquantity they had obtained elsewhere. They wished to set aside the\r\nfifth belonging to the royal treasury; for it has been decided that\r\nthe fifth part of all gold, silver, and precious stones shall be set\r\naside for the King's agents. The remainder is divided according to\r\nagreement. Several disputes arose among the Spaniards regarding their\r\nshares. The eldest son of Comogre, the wise youth, who was present,\r\nstruck the scales with his fist and scattered the gold in all\r\ndirections, and calling our men's attention he spoke in choice\r\nlanguage as follows:\r\n\r\n\"What thing then is this, Christians? Is it possible that you set\r\na high value upon such a small quantity of gold? You nevertheless\r\ndestroy the artistic beauty of these necklaces, melting them into\r\ningots. [For the Spaniards had their smelting instruments with them.]\r\nIf your thirst of gold is such that in order to satisfy it you disturb\r\npeaceable people and bring misfortune and calamity among them, if you\r\nexile yourselves from your country in search of gold, I will show you\r\na country where it abounds and where you can satisfy the thirst that\r\ntorments you. But to undertake this expedition you need more numerous\r\nforces, for you will have to conquer powerful rulers, who will defend\r\ntheir country to the death. More than all others, the King Tumanama\r\nwill oppose your advance, for his is the richest kingdom of all.\r\nIt lies six suns distant from ours [they count the days by suns];\r\nmoreover you will encounter Carib tribes in the mountains, fierce\r\npeople who live on human flesh, are subject to no law, and have no\r\nfixed country. They conquered the mountaineers for they coveted the\r\ngold mines, and for this reason they abandoned their own country.\r\nThey transform the gold they obtain by the labour of the wretched\r\nmountaineers into wrought leaves and different articles such as those\r\nyou see, and by this means they obtain what they want. They have\r\nartisans and jewellers who produce these necklaces. We place no\r\nmore value on rough gold than on a lump of clay, before it has been\r\ntransformed by the workman's hand into a vase which pleases our taste\r\nor serves our need. These Caribs also make artistic potteries which we\r\nobtain in exchange for the products of our harvests, as for example\r\nour prisoners of war, whom they buy for food, or our stuffs and\r\ndifferent articles of furniture. We also furnish them with the\r\nsupplies they need; for they live in the mountains. Only by force of\r\narms could this mountain district be penetrated. Once on the other\r\nside of those mountains,\" he said, indicating with his finger another\r\nmountain range towards the south, \"another sea which has never been\r\nsailed by your little boats [meaning the caravels] is visible. The\r\npeople there go naked and live as we do, but they use both sails and\r\noars. On the other side of the watershed the whole south slope of the\r\nmountain chain is very rich in gold mines.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was his speech, and he added that the cacique Tumanama, and all\r\nthe mountaineers living on the other slope of the mountain, used\r\nkitchen and other common utensils made of gold; \"for gold,\" he said,\r\n\"has no more value among them than iron among you.\" From what he had\r\nheard from the Spaniards he knew the name of the metal used for swords\r\nand other arms. Our leaders were amazed at that naked young man's\r\ndiscourse which, thanks to the three deserters who had been during\r\neighteen months at the court of Careca, they understood. They took a\r\ndecision worthy of the moment and, abandoning their wrangling over the\r\ngold-weighing, they began to joke and to discuss amiably the words and\r\ninformation of the young cacique. They asked him amicably why he had\r\ntold them that story, and what they should do in case reinforcements\r\ndid arrive. The son of Comogre reflected for a moment, as does an\r\norator preparing for a serious debate, even thinking of the bodily\r\nmovements likely to convince his hearers, and then spoke again as\r\nfollows, always in his own language:\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, Christians; we people who go naked are not tormented by\r\ncovetousness, but we are ambitious, and we fight one against the other\r\nfor power, each seeking to conquer his neighbour. This, therefore, is\r\nthe source of frequent wars and of all our misfortunes. Our ancestors\r\nhave been fighting men. Our father, Comogre, likewise fought with his\r\nneighbouring caciques, and we have been both conquerors and conquered.\r\nJust as you see prisoners of war amongst us, as for instance those\r\nseventy captives I have presented to you, so likewise have our enemies\r\ncaptured some of our people; for such are the fortunes of war. Here\r\nis one of our servants who was once the slave of the cacique who\r\npossesses such treasures of gold, and is the ruler beyond the\r\nmountains; there this man dragged out several years of a wretched\r\nexistence. Not only he, but many other prisoners as well as freemen,\r\nwho have traversed that country and afterwards come amongst us, know\r\nthese particulars as far back as they can remember; nevertheless\r\nto convince you of the truth of my information and to allay your\r\nsuspicions, I will myself go as your guide. You may bind me, and you\r\nmay hang me to the first tree if you find I have not told you the\r\nexact truth. Summon, therefore, a thousand soldiers, well armed for\r\nfighting, in order that, by their help, and assisted by the warriors\r\nof my father Comogre armed in their style, we may shatter the power of\r\nour enemies. In this way you will obtain the gold you want, and our\r\nreward for guiding and helping you will be our deliverance from\r\nhostile attacks and from the fear under which our ancestors lived; and\r\nwhich destroys our enjoyment of peace.\"\r\n\r\nAfter speaking thus the wise son of Comogre kept silence; and the love\r\nof gain and the hope of gold fairly made our men's mouths water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards remained several days in that place, during which they\r\nbaptised the cacique Comogre, giving him the name of Charles, after\r\nthe Spanish prince, and likewise all his family with him. They then\r\nrejoined their companions at Darien, promising, however, to send the\r\nsoldiers his son desired to assist him in crossing the sierra and\r\nreaching the southern ocean. Upon their arrival at their village they\r\nlearned that Valdivia had returned six months after his departure but\r\nwith very few stores, because his ship was a small one. He did bring,\r\nhowever, the promise of speedy reinforcements and provisions. The\r\nAdmiral-Viceroy and the other government officials of Hispaniola\r\nadmitted that they had thus far taken little thought for the colonists\r\nat Darien, because they supposed the judge, Enciso, had already sailed\r\nwith a well-freighted ship. They assured the colonists that for the\r\nfuture they would have care for their needs. For the time being they\r\nhad no vessel larger than the one they had lent to Valdivia and which\r\nsufficed to relieve their present wants.\r\n\r\nThis caravel was, in fact, a caravel in name only, and because of\r\nits form, but not in its capacity. The provisions Valdivia brought\r\nsufficed only for the needs of the moment, and within a few days after\r\nhis arrival the miseries of famine once more began, chiefly because\r\na waterspout burst from the mountain top, accompanied by terrible\r\nlightnings and thunders, and washed down such an amount of rubbish\r\nthat the harvests, planted in the month of September before the\r\ncampaign against the cacique Comogre began, were either swept away or\r\ncompletely buried. They consisted of the grain for bread-making, which\r\nis called in Hispaniola maize, and in Uraba _hobba_. This maize is\r\nharvested twice yearly, for the cold of winter is unknown in this\r\ncountry, because of its proximity to the equator. Bread made of hobba\r\nor maize is preferable to wheaten bread for those who live in this\r\nregion, because it is more easily digested. This is in conformity\r\nwith physical laws, since, as cold diminishes, less inward heat is\r\ngenerated.\r\n\r\nTheir hopes of a harvest being thus defeated, and knowing that the\r\nneighbouring caciques had already been stripped of their provisions\r\nand gold, the Spaniards were forced to penetrate into the interior in\r\nsearch of food. At the same time they sent to inform the officials in\r\nHispaniola of their distress, and also of Comogre's revelations to\r\nthem about the southern ocean. It was desirable that the King of\r\nSpain should send a thousand soldiers with whom they might cross the\r\nmountains separating the two seas. Valdivia was sent back with these\r\nletters, and he was charged to deliver to the King's fiscal agent in\r\nHispaniola the royal fifth due to the treasury, represented by three\r\nhundred pounds of gold, at eight ounces to the pound. This pound is\r\ncalled a _marc_ in Spanish, and is composed of fifty gold pieces,\r\ncalled castellanos. The weight of each castellano, a Castilian coin,\r\nis called a peso, and the entire sum, therefore, amounted to fifteen\r\nthousand castellanos. The castellano is a coin somewhat inferior to\r\none thirtieth of a pound, but its value exceeds that of a golden\r\nducat. This coin is peculiar to Castile, and is not minted in any\r\nother province. It may be concluded, therefore, from the sum assigned\r\nfor the royal fifth, that the Spaniards had taken from the caciques\r\nfifteen hundred pounds of gold, at eight ounces to the pound. They\r\nhad found this metal worked into divers shapes: necklaces collars,\r\nbracelets, small plaques to be worn on the breast, and ear or nose\r\nrings.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of the ides of January, Anno Domini 1511, Valdivia\r\nset sail on the little caravel with which he had just returned. In\r\naddition to the instructions sent by Vasco Nuñez and the gold destined\r\nfor the royal fisc, which we have mentioned, his friends had confided\r\nto him their treasure for their relatives in Spain. I shall relate\r\nin proper time what happened to Valdivia, but for the present let us\r\nreturn to the colony at Uraba.\r\n\r\nAfter Valdivia's departure the colonists, driven to desperation by\r\nhunger, resolved to explore the outline of the gulf, of which the most\r\nremote extremity is about eighty miles distant from the entrance. This\r\nextremity is called by the Spaniards Culata.[1]\r\n\r\n[Note 1: The southern end of the gulf still bears the name _Culata\r\ndel golfo_.]\r\n\r\nVasco Nuñez embarked with about one hundred men on board a brigantine\r\nand in some native barques dug out of tree trunks, called by the\r\nislanders of Hispaniola canoes, and by the people of Uraba, _uru_. The\r\nriver flows into the gulf at that place from the east and is ten times\r\nlarger than the Darien. Up this river the Spaniards sailed for a\r\ndistance of thirty miles or a little more than nine leagues, and\r\nturning to the left, which is towards the south, they came upon a\r\nnative village, whose cacique was called Dobaiba. In Hispaniola their\r\nkings are called caciques and in Uraba, _chebi_, with the accent on\r\nthe last vowel. It was learned that Zemaco, cacique of Darien, who had\r\nbeen defeated by the Spaniards in open battle, had taken refuge with\r\nDobaiba. The latter, counselled, as it was thought, by Zemaco, fled,\r\nand thus evaded the Spanish attack. The place was deserted, though a\r\nstock of bows and arrows, some pieces of furniture, nets, and several\r\nfishing boats were found there. These districts being marshy and low\r\nare unsuitable both for agriculture and plantations of trees, so there\r\nare few food products, and the natives only procure these by trading\r\nwhat fish they have in excess of their wants with their neighbours.\r\nNevertheless seven thousand castellanos of gold were picked up in the\r\ndeserted houses, besides several canoes, about a hundred bows and\r\nparcels of arrows, all the furniture, and two native barques or uru.\r\n\r\nIn the night-time bats swarmed from the marshes formed by this\r\nriver, and these animals, which are as big as pigeons, tormented\r\nthe Spaniards with their painful bites. Those who have been bitten\r\nconfirmed this fact, and the judge Enciso who had been expelled, when\r\nasked by me concerning the danger of such bites, told me that one\r\nnight, when he slept uncovered because of the heat, he had been bitten\r\nby one of these animals on the heel, but that the wound had not been\r\nmore dangerous than one made by any other non-poisonous creature.\r\nOther people claim that the bite is mortal, but may be cured by being\r\nwashed immediately with sea-water; Enciso also spoke of the efficacy\r\nof this remedy. Cauterisation is also used, as it is employed for\r\nwounds caused by native poisoned arrows. Enciso had had experience\r\nin Caribana, where many of his men had been wounded. The Spaniards\r\nreturned to the Gulf of Uraba only partly satisfied, for they had\r\nbrought back no provisions. Such a terrible tempest overtook them in\r\nthat immense gulf on their return voyage, that they were obliged to\r\nthrow everything they had stolen from those wretched fishermen into\r\nthe sea. Moreover the uru, that is to say, the barques, were lost and\r\nwith them some of the men on board.\r\n\r\nWhile Vasco Nuñez was exploring the southern extremity of the gulf,\r\nRoderigo Colmenares advanced, as had been agreed, by way of the river\r\nbed towards the mountains along the eastern coast. At a distance of\r\nabout forty miles, that is to say, twelve leagues from the river's\r\nmouth, he came upon some villages built on the river bank; the chief,\r\nthat is to say, chebi, was named Turvi. Colmenares remained with that\r\ncacique, while Vasco Nuñez, who had meanwhile returned to Darien,\r\nmarched to meet him. When the men of the two companies had been\r\nsomewhat recuperated by the provisions which Turvi furnished, their\r\nleaders continued their march together. About forty miles distant they\r\ndiscovered an island in the river, which was inhabited by fishermen,\r\nand as they found wild cinnamon trees there, they named the island\r\nCannafistula. There were some sixty villages in groups of ten houses\r\neach on this island, and the river on the right side was large enough\r\nboth for the native boats and for the brigantines. This river the\r\nSpaniards named Rio Negro.\r\n\r\nFifteen miles from its mouth they found a village composed of five\r\nhundred scattered houses, of which the chebi or cacique was called\r\nAbenamacheios. All the houses were abandoned as soon as the Spaniards\r\napproached; and while they were pursuing the natives the latter\r\nsuddenly turned, faced them, and threw themselves upon our soldiers\r\nwith the desperation of men driven from their homes. They fought with\r\nwooden swords, sticks with hardened points and sharp javelins, but not\r\nwith arrows; for the river population of the west side of the gulf\r\ndo not use arrows in fighting. These poor creatures, being, in fact,\r\nnaked, were easily cut to pieces, and in the pursuit, the cacique\r\nAbenamacheios and some of his principal chiefs were captured. A\r\nfoot-soldier, who had been wounded by the cacique, cut off his arm\r\nwith one blow of his sword, though this was done against the will of\r\nthe commanders. The Christians numbered altogether about one hundred\r\nand fifty men, and the leaders left one half of them in this village,\r\ncontinuing their way with the others in nine of the barques which I\r\nhave called uru.\r\n\r\nSeventy miles distant from Rio Negro and the island of Cannafistula,\r\nthe Spaniards, passing by several streams on the right and left which\r\nswelled the principal river, entered another under the guidance of a\r\nnative chief who took charge of the boats. The cacique of the country\r\nalong its banks was called Abibaiba.\r\n\r\nAll the region was swampy and the chief house of the cacique was\r\nbuilt in a tree. Novel and unaccustomed dwelling place! The country,\r\nhowever, has such lofty trees that the natives may easily build houses\r\namong their branches. We read something of this kind in different\r\nauthors who write of certain tribes who, when the waters are rising,\r\ntake refuge in these lofty trees and live upon the fish caught in\r\ntheir branches. They place beams among the branches, joining them so\r\nfirmly that they resist the strongest winds. The Spaniards believe the\r\nnatives live thus in the trees because inundations are frequent, for\r\nthese trees are so tall that no human arm could reach them with a\r\nstone. I no longer feel surprised at what Pliny and other writers\r\nrecord about trees in India which, by reason of the fertility of the\r\nsoil and the abundant waters, attain such a height that no one could\r\nshoot an arrow over them. It is, moreover, commonly believed that the\r\nsoil of this country and the supply of water are equal to that of\r\nany other land under the sun. The above-named trees were found by\r\nmeasuring to be of such a size that seven or eight men, with extended\r\narms, could hardly reach around them. The natives have cellars\r\nunderground where they keep stores of the wines we have before\r\nmentioned. Although the violence of the wind cannot blow down their\r\nhouses or break the branches of the trees, they are still swayed about\r\nfrom side to side, and this movement would spoil the wine. Everything\r\nelse they require, they keep with them in the trees, and whenever the\r\nprincipal chiefs or caciques breakfast or dine, the servants bring up\r\nthe wine by means of ladders attached to the tree trunks, and they are\r\njust as quick about it as our servants who, upon a level floor, serve\r\ndrinks from a sideboard near the table.\r\n\r\nApproaching the tree of Abibaiba a discussion began between him and\r\nthe Spaniards; the latter offering him peace and begging him to come\r\ndown. The cacique refused and begged to be allowed to live in his own\r\nfashion. Promises were succeeded by threats, and he was told that if\r\nhe did not come down with all his family they would either cut down or\r\nset fire to the tree. A second time Abibaiba refused, so they attacked\r\nthe tree with axes; and when the cacique saw the chips flying he\r\nchanged his mind and came down, accompanied by his two sons. They\r\nproceeded to discuss about peace and gold. Abibaiba declared that he\r\nhad no gold, and that as he had never needed it, he had taken no\r\npains to get it. The Spaniards insisting, the cacique said: \"If\r\nyour cupidity be such, I will seek gold for you in the neighbouring\r\nmountains and when I find it I will bring it to you; for it is found\r\nin those mountains you behold.\" He fixed a day when he would return,\r\nbut neither then nor later did he reappear.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards came back, loaded with the supplies and the wines of\r\nthe cacique, but without the gold they had counted upon. Nevertheless\r\nAbibaiba, his subjects, and his sons gave the same information\r\nconcerning the gold mines and the Caribs who live upon human flesh,\r\nas I have mentioned, as did those at Comogra. They ascended the river\r\nanother thirty miles and came to the huts of some cannibals but found\r\nthem empty, for the savages, alarmed by the approach of the Spaniards,\r\nhad taken refuge in the mountains, carrying everything they possessed\r\non their backs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these things were happening on the banks of this river, an\r\nofficer named Raia, whom Vasco Nuñez and Colmenares had left in\r\ncharge of the camp at Rio Negro in the territory of the cacique\r\nAbenamacheios, driven either by hunger or fatality ventured to\r\nexplore the neighbourhood with nine of his companions. He went to the\r\nneighbouring village belonging to the cacique Abraibes, and there Raia\r\nand two of his companions were massacred by that chief, the others\r\nsucceeding in escaping. Some few days later Abraibes, sympathising\r\nwith his relative and neighbour Abenamacheios, who had been\r\ndriven from his house and had had his arm cut off by one of our\r\nfoot-soldiers, gave the latter refuge in his house, after which he\r\nsought out Abibaiba, the cacique who lived in a tree. The latter,\r\nhaving been driven from his abode, also avoided attack by the\r\nSpaniards and wandered in the most inaccessible regions of the\r\nmountains and forests.\r\n\r\nAbraibes spoke in the following words to Abibaiba: \"What is this that\r\nis happening, O unfortunate Abibaiba? What race is this that allows\r\nus, unfortunates that we are, no peace? And for how long shall we\r\nendure their cruelty? Is it not better to die than to submit to\r\nsuch abuse as you have endured from them? And not only you, but our\r\nneighbours Abenamacheios, Zemaco, Careca, Poncha, and all the other\r\ncaciques our friends? They carry off our wives and sons into captivity\r\nbefore our very eyes, and they seize everything we possess as though\r\nit were their booty. Shall we endure this? Me they have not yet\r\nattacked, but the experience of others is enough for me, and I know\r\nthat the hour of my ruin is not far distant. Let us then unite\r\nour forces and try to struggle against those who have maltreated\r\nAbenamacheios and driven him from his house, and when these first are\r\nkilled the others will fear to attack us, or if they do so, it will be\r\nwith diminished numbers, and in any case it will be more endurable for\r\nus.\" After exchanging their views, Abibaiba and Abraibes came to an\r\nunderstanding and decided upon a day for beginning their campaign. But\r\nevents were not favourable to them. It so happened by chance that,\r\non the night previous to the day fixed for the attack, thirty of the\r\nsoldiers who had crossed the sierra against the cannibals were sent\r\nback to relieve the garrison left at Rio Negro, in case of attack, and\r\nalso because the Spaniards were suspicious. The caciques rushed into\r\nthe village at daybreak with five hundred of their warriors armed\r\nin native fashion and shouting wildly. They were ignorant of the\r\nreinforcements that had arrived during the night. The soldiers\r\nadvanced to meet them, using their shields to protect themselves; and\r\nfirst shooting arrows and javelins and afterwards using their native\r\nswords, they fell upon their enemies. These native people, finding\r\nthemselves engaged with more adversaries than they had imagined, were\r\neasily routed; the majority were killed like sheep in a panic. The\r\nchiefs escaped. All those who were captured were sent as slaves to\r\nDarien, where they were put to work in the fields.\r\n\r\nAfter these events, and leaving that region pacified, the Spaniards\r\ndescended the river and returned to Darien, posting a guard of thirty\r\nmen, commanded by an officer, Hurtado,[1] to hold that province.\r\nHurtado descended the Rio Negro to rejoin his leader, Vasco Nuñez, and\r\nhis companions. He was using one of those large native barques and had\r\nwith him twelve companions, a captive woman, and twenty-four slaves.\r\nAll at once four uru, that is to say, barques dug out of tree trunks,\r\nattacked him on the flank, and overturned his boat. The Spaniards had\r\nbeen tranquilly sailing along without dreaming of the possibility of\r\nan attack, and their barque being suddenly overturned all those whom\r\nthe natives could catch were massacred or drowned, except two men, who\r\ngrasped some floating tree trunks and, concealing themselves in the\r\nbranches, let themselves drift, unseen by the enemy, and thus managed\r\nto rejoin their companions.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: _Furatado quodam decurione. Licet decurione more romano\r\nnon sint addicti præcise quindecim milites quos regat, centurionique\r\ncentum viginti octo, centuriones tamen ultro citroque centenarium\r\nnumerum, et ultro citroque denum, decurionem est consilium appellare;\r\nnec enim hos servant ordines hispani ex amussim, cogimurque nomine\r\nrebus et magistratibus dare_. Thus Peter Martyr for the second time\r\nvindicates his knowledge of Roman military terms and his usage of\r\nthem. His explanation is extraneous to the narrative.]\r\n\r\nWarned of the danger by those two men who had escaped death, the\r\nSpaniards became suspicious of everything. They were alarmed for their\r\nsafety, and remembered that they only escaped a similar calamity at\r\nRio Negro because they had received the reinforcement of thirty men on\r\nthe night before the attack. They held frequent councils of war, but\r\nin the midst of their hesitations they reached no decision. After\r\ncareful investigation they finally learned that five caciques had\r\nfixed a day for the massacre of Christians. These five were: Abibaiba,\r\nwho lived in the swampy forest; Zemaco, who had been driven from his\r\nhome; Abraibes and Abenamacheios, the river chiefs; and Dobaiba, the\r\ncacique of the fishermen, living at the extremity of the gulf called\r\nCulata. This plan would have been carried out, and it was only by a\r\nmiracle, which we are bound to examine with leniency, that chance\r\ndisclosed the plot of the caciques. It is a memorable story and I will\r\ntell it in a few words.\r\n\r\nThis Vasco Nuñez, a man of action rather than of judgment, was an\r\negregious ruffian, who had obtained authority in Darien by force\r\nrather than by consent of the colonists; amongst the numerous native\r\nwomen he had carried off, there was one of remarkable beauty. One of\r\nher brothers, who was an officer much favoured by the cacique Zemaco,\r\noften came to visit her. He likewise had been driven out of his\r\ncountry, but as he loved his sister warmly, he spoke to her in\r\nconversation in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, my dear sister, and keep to yourself what I shall tell\r\nyou. The insolence of these men, who expelled us from our homes, is\r\nsuch that the caciques of the country are resolved no longer to submit\r\nto their tyranny. Five caciques [whom he named one after another] have\r\ncombined and have collected a hundred uru. Five thousand warriors on\r\nland and water are prepared. Provisions have been collected in the\r\nprovince of Tichiri, for the maintenance of these warriors, and the\r\ncaciques have already divided amongst themselves the heads and the\r\nproperty of the Spaniards.\"\r\n\r\nIn revealing these things to his sister, the brother warned her to\r\nconceal herself on a certain day, otherwise she might be killed in the\r\nconfusion of the fight. The conquering warrior gives no quarter to\r\nthose whom he vanquishes. He concluded by telling her the day fixed\r\nfor the attack. Women generally keep the fire better than they do a\r\nsecret,[2] and so it fell out that this young woman, either because\r\nshe loved Vasco Nuñez or because in her panic she forgot her\r\nrelatives, her kinsmen, and neighbours as well as the caciques whom\r\nshe betrayed to their death, revealed the same to her lover, omitting\r\nnone of the details her brother had imprudently confided to her.\r\nVasco Nuñez sent this Fulvia to invite her brother to return, and he\r\nimmediately responded to his sister's invitation. He was seized and\r\nforced to confess that the cacique Zemaco, his master, had sent those\r\nfour uru for the massacre of the Spaniards, and that the plot had been\r\nconceived by him. Zemaco took upon himself the task of killing\r\nVasco Nuñez, and forty of his people whom he had sent as an act of\r\nfriendship to sow and cultivate Vasco's fields, had been ordered by\r\nhim to kill the leader with their agricultural tools. Vasco Nuñez\r\nhabitually encouraged his labourers at their work by frequently\r\nvisiting them, and the cacique's men had never ventured to execute his\r\norders, because Vasco never went among them except on horseback, and\r\narmed. When visiting his labourers he rode a mare and always carried a\r\nspear in his hand, as men do in Spain; and it was for this reason that\r\nZemaco, seeing his wishes frustrated, had conceived the other plot\r\nwhich resulted so disastrously for himself and his people.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Literally, _Puella vero, quia ferrum est quod feminæ\r\nobservant, magis quam Catonianam gravitatem_.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the conspiracy was discovered, Vasco Nuñez, assembling\r\nseventy men, ordered them to follow him, without however telling any\r\none either his destination or his intentions. He first rode to the\r\nvillage of Zemaco, some ten miles distant, where he learned that\r\nZemaco had fled to Dabaiba, the cacique of the marshes of Culata. His\r\nprincipal lieutenant (called in their language _sacchos_, just as\r\ntheir caciques are called chebi) was seized, together with all his\r\nother servants, and carried into captivity. Several other natives of\r\nboth sexes were likewise captured. Simultaneously Colmenares embarked\r\nsixty soldiers in the four uru and set out up the river to look for\r\nZemaco. The young woman's brother served as guide. Arriving at the\r\nvillage of Tichiri, where the provisions for the army had been\r\ncollected, Vasco Nuñez took possession of the place and captured\r\nthe stores of different coloured wines, as we have already noted at\r\nComogra, and different kinds of native stores. The sacchos of Tichiri,\r\nwho had acted in a manner as quartermaster of the army, was captured\r\ntogether with four of the principal officers, for they did not expect\r\nthe arrival of the Spaniards. The sacchos was hanged on a tree that he\r\nhad himself planted, and shot through with arrows in full view of\r\nthe natives, and the other officers were hanged by Colmenares on\r\nscaffolds, to serve as an example to the others. This chastisement of\r\nthe conspirators so terrified the entire province that there was not\r\na person left to raise a finger against the torrent of Spanish wrath.\r\nPeace was thus established, and their caciques bending their necks\r\nbeneath the yoke were not punished. The Spaniards enjoyed some days of\r\nabundance, thanks to the well-filled storehouse they had captured at\r\nTichiri.[3]\r\n\r\n[Note 3: This pitiful story of native treachery is frequently\r\nrepeated, and explains the enslavement, the downfall, and in parts,\r\nthe extermination of the American tribes. Everywhere they betrayed one\r\nanother to the final undoing of all.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the general assembly convoked shortly afterwards, the colonists\r\nunanimously decided to send an envoy to Hispaniola to ask for\r\nreinforcements and for the appointment of a judge. The same envoy\r\nwould go on to Spain where he would first explain to the Admiral and\r\nhis officers and afterwards to the King, all that had happened, and\r\nwould seek to persuade his Majesty to send the thousand soldiers the\r\nson of Comogre had declared would be necessary for the expedition\r\nacross the mountains to the South Sea. Vasco Nuñez sought to be chosen\r\nfor this mission, but his companions refused him their votes, and his\r\nadherents would not allow him to go; not only because they would have\r\nfelt themselves abandoned, but because they suspected that once out of\r\nit, Vasco would not return to such a furnace of calamities, following\r\nthe example of Valdivia and Zamudio, whom they had sent off in\r\nthe month of January, and who, they thought, had no intention of\r\nreturning. In this latter they were wrong, as we shall show in the\r\nproper place, for those men were dead.\r\n\r\nAfter several ballotings without result, the colonists finally chose\r\na certain Juan Quevedo, a serious man of mature age, who was agent of\r\nthe royal treasury in Darien. They had full confidence that Quevedo\r\nwould conduct this business successfully, and they counted on his\r\nreturn because he had brought his wife with him to the new world and\r\nwas leaving her in the colony as a pledge. As soon as Quevedo was\r\nelected, several opinions concerning an associate for him were\r\nexpressed. Some people said it was risky to trust such an important\r\naffair to one man; not that they mistrusted Quevedo, but human life is\r\nuncertain, particularly if one considers that people accustomed to a\r\nclimate near the equator would be exposed on returning northwards to\r\nfrequent changes of climate and food. It was necessary, therefore, to\r\nprovide an associate for Quevedo, so that, if one died the other\r\nmight survive and if both escaped death, the King would place more\r\nconfidence in their dual report. Much time was spent in debating this\r\npoint, and finally they decided to choose Roderigo Colmenares, whose\r\nname I have frequently mentioned. He was a man of large experience; in\r\nhis youth he had travelled by land and sea over all Europe, and he had\r\ntaken part in the Italian wars against the French. What decided the\r\ncolonists to choose Colmenares was the fact that, if he left, they\r\ncould count on his return, because he had purchased properties in\r\nDarien and had spent large sums in planting. He hoped to sell his\r\ncrops as they stood, and to obtain the gold of his companions in\r\nexchange. He therefore left the care of his estates to a citizen of\r\nMadrid, a certain Alonzo Nuñez, who was his comrade. This man was a\r\njudge, and had almost been chosen by the colonists as an envoy in\r\nplace of his friend Colmenares; and indeed he would have been elected\r\nbut that one of his companions explained that he had a wife at Madrid.\r\nIt was feared, therefore, that the tears of his wife might prevent\r\nhim from ever returning, so Colmenares, being free, was chosen as the\r\nassociate of Quevedo. There being no larger ship at their disposal,\r\nboth men sailed on a brigantine, the fourth day of the calends of\r\nNovember in the year of grace 1512.\r\n\r\nDuring their voyage they were buffeted by many tempests, and were\r\nfinally dashed upon the western coast of that large island which for a\r\nlong time was thought to be a continent, and which in my First Decade\r\nI explained was called Cuba. They were reduced to the most extreme\r\nwant, for three months had elapsed since they left Darien. They were,\r\ntherefore, forced to land to seek some assistance from the islanders,\r\nand by chance they approached on that side of the island where\r\nValdivia had also been driven ashore by tempests. Ah! unhappy\r\ncreatures! you colonists of Darien, who await the return of Valdivia\r\nto assuage your sufferings. Hardly had he landed before he and his\r\ncompanions were massacred by the Cubans, the caravel broken to pieces\r\nand left upon the shore. Upon beholding some planks of that caravel\r\nhalf buried in the sand, the envoys bewailed the death of Valdivia and\r\nhis companions. They found no bodies, for these had either been thrown\r\ninto the sea, or had served as food for the cannibals, for these\r\nlatter frequently made raids in Cuba in order to procure human flesh.\r\nTwo islanders who had been captured, related the death of Valdivia,\r\nwhich had been brought about by the love of gold. These islanders\r\nconfessed that, having learned from the talk of one of Valdivia's\r\ncompanions that he had gold, they had plotted to assassinate him\r\nbecause they too loved gold necklaces.\r\n\r\nHorrified by this catastrophe, and feeling themselves unable to avenge\r\ntheir companions the Spaniards decided to fly from that barbarous land\r\nand the monstrous cruelty of those savages. They therefore continued\r\ntheir voyage, stunned by the massacre of their companions and\r\nsuffering severely from want. After leaving the southern coast of Cuba\r\nbehind them, a thousand untoward events still further delayed them.\r\nThey learned that Hojeda had also landed and that he had been driven\r\nby storms upon these coasts, where he led a wretched existence. He\r\nendured a thousand annoyances and a thousand different kinds of\r\nsufferings. After having suffered the loss of his companions or\r\nwitnessed them gasping from hunger, he had been carried to Hispaniola\r\nalmost alone.\r\n\r\nHe arrived there hardly alive, and died from the effects of the wound\r\nhe had received from the natives of Uraba. Enciso, the judge elect,\r\nhad sailed along this same coast, but with better fortune, for he had\r\nhad favourable weather.\r\n\r\nHe himself told me these things at Court, and he added that the\r\nnatives of Cuba had received him kindly, especially the people of a\r\ncertain cacique called El Comendador [the Commander]. When this chief\r\nwas about to be baptised by some Christians who were passing through,\r\nhe asked them how the governor of the neighbouring island of\r\nHispaniola was called, and he was answered that he was called El\r\nComendador.[1] The governor of that island was at that period, an\r\nillustrious knight of the Order of Calatrava, and the knights of that\r\nOrder take the title of Commander. The cacique promptly declared that\r\nhe wished to be called El Comendador; and he it was who had given\r\nhospitality to Enciso, when he landed, and had supplied all his wants.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: Don Nicholas de Ovando, Comendador de Lares, and later\r\nGrand Master of the Order of Calatrava.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Enciso, now is the time, Most Holy Father from whom we\r\nreceive our religion and our beliefs, to preach to the islanders. An\r\nunknown sailor,[2] who was ill, had been left by some Spaniards who\r\nwere coasting the length of Cuba, with the cacique El Comendador, and\r\nthis sailor was very kindly received by the cacique and his people.\r\nWhen he recovered his health, he frequently served the cacique as\r\nlieutenant in his expeditions, for the islanders are often at war one\r\nwith another; and El Comendador was always victorious. The sailor\r\nwas an ignorant creature, but a man of good heart, who cultivated\r\na peculiar devotion for the Blessed Virgin, Mother of God. He even\r\ncarried about him, as constantly as his clothes, a picture of the\r\nBlessed Virgin, very well painted on paper, and he declared to El\r\nComendador that it was because of it that he was always victorious.\r\nHe also persuaded the latter to abandon the zemes the people adored,\r\nbecause he declared that these nocturnal goblins were the enemies of\r\nsouls, and he urged the cacique to choose for his patron the Virgin\r\nMother of God, if he desired all his undertakings, both in peace and\r\nin war, to succeed. The Virgin Mother of God was never deaf to the\r\ninvocation of her holy name by a pure heart. The sailor obtained a\r\nready hearing from these naked islanders. Upon the request of the\r\ncacique he gave him the image of the Virgin, and consecrated a church\r\nand an altar to it. The zemes, whom their ancestors had worshipped\r\nwere abandoned. These zemes, Most Holy Father, are the idols made out\r\nof cotton, of which I have spoken at length in the tenth book of my\r\nFirst Decade. Following the instructions of the sailor, the cacique El\r\nComendador and all his people of both sexes went each day at sunset\r\nto the chapel dedicated to the Virgin. Entering, they knelt, and\r\nreverently bowing their heads and joining their hands they saluted the\r\nimage by repeated invocations, _Ave Maria, Ave Maria_; for there were\r\nvery few who had learnt the whole prayer.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Las Casas tells an identical story concerning Alonso\r\nde Hojeda, who gave an image of the Blessed Virgin to a cacique of\r\nCueyba. During the campaign which ended in the conquest of Cuba, Las\r\nCasas offered to trade a Flemish statue for the one Hojeda had left\r\nthere, but the cacique refused, and taking his image, he fled into\r\nthe woods, lest he should be forced to exchange. The two stories,\r\ndoubtless, refer to the same incident, though it seems strange that\r\nPeter Martyr should not have identified Hojeda as the \"unknown\r\nsailor.\" See Las Casas, _Hist. de las Indias_, tom, iv., cap. xix.:\r\n_B. Las Casas, his Life, his Apostolate, and his Writings_, cap iv.]\r\n\r\nWhen Enciso and his companions landed there, the Indians took them by\r\nthe hands and joyfully led them to the chapel, declaring that they\r\nwere going to show them something wonderful. They pointed to the holy\r\nimage surrounded, as though with a garland, by dishes full of food and\r\ndrink. They offered these presents to the image just as they formerly\r\ndid in their own religion to the zemes. They say that by such\r\nofferings they provide for the image in case it should be hungry, for\r\nthey believe that it might suffer from hunger.\r\n\r\nListen now to a most curious story concerning the assistance they\r\nbelieve they have received from that image of the Blessed Virgin, and\r\nby my faith, Most Holy Father, one would willingly believe it to be\r\ntrue. According to the report of our men, the effect of the fervent\r\npiety which animates those simple souls for the Blessed Virgin Mother\r\nof God is such, that they almost constrain her to come down from\r\nheaven to help them whenever they weaken in a struggle. Has not God\r\nleft pity, love, and charity amongst men, by the practice of which\r\nthey may merit His grace and that of the heavenly host? The Virgin\r\ncould never abandon those who with pure heart invoke her aid. Now El\r\nComendador and all his chiefs declared to Enciso and his companions,\r\nthat when the sailor had carried the holy image with him into battle\r\nin full view of both armies, the zemes of the enemy turned their heads\r\nand trembled in the presence of the image of the Virgin; for it is the\r\ncustom for each army to carry its own protecting zemes into battle.\r\nNot only had they beheld the holy image but also a woman, robed in\r\nfair white draperies, who, in the heat of the battle, sustained\r\nthem against their enemies. The latter also declared that there had\r\nappeared opposite to them a woman with menacing face, carrying a\r\nsceptre, who encouraged the opposing army and that this apparition\r\nmade them tremble with fear.\r\n\r\nEl Comendador declared that after the sailor had been taken away by\r\nsome Christians who had landed at that place, he had faithfully obeyed\r\nhis instructions. He further related that a heated altercation had\r\nbroken out with his neighbours, as to which of the zemes was most\r\npowerful. The controversy led to frequent conflicts, in which the\r\nBlessed Virgin had never failed them, but had appeared in every\r\nbattle, grasping the victory with her small hands from the most\r\nformidable of the hostile forces. The Spaniards asked what their war\r\ncry was, and they replied that, in obedience to the instructions of\r\nthe sailor they only shouted, in the Spanish language, \"St. Mary to\r\nthe rescue!\" It was the only language the sailor spoke. In the midst\r\nof these cruel wars they made the following agreement; instead of\r\nputting a fixed number of champions into the field, as was often done\r\nby the armies of other nations of antiquity, or instead of settling\r\ntheir disputes by arbitration, two young men of each tribe should have\r\ntheir hands tied behind their backs as tightly as he who bound them\r\nchose. They would then be led to a lofty place, and the zemes of the\r\ntribe whose champion most quickly undid his bonds should be acclaimed\r\nas the most powerful. The agreement was made, and the young men\r\nof both sides were thus bound. El Comendador's people tied their\r\nadversary, while their enemies tied one of his men. Three different\r\ntimes the trial was repeated, and each time after invoking their\r\nzemes, the young men tried to free themselves from their bonds. El\r\nComendador's champions repeated the invocation, \"St. Mary, help me,\r\nSt. Mary, help me!\" and immediately the Virgin, robed in white,\r\nappeared. She drove away the demon, and touching the bonds of the\r\nChristian champion with the wand she carried, not only was he at once\r\nfreed, but the bonds were added to those of his opponent, so that the\r\nenemy found the young Christian not only free, but their own champion\r\nwith double bonds. They were not content with this first defeat,\r\nand attributed it to some human trickery which they did not believe\r\ndemonstrated the superiority of the divinity. They therefore asked\r\nthat four men of venerable age and tried morality should be chosen\r\nfrom each tribe, and should stand on either side of each young man, in\r\norder to verify whether or not there was any trickery. O what\r\npurity of soul and blessed simplicity, worthy of the golden age!\r\nEl Comendador and his advisers yielded to this condition with a\r\nconfidence equal to that with which the sufferer from an effusion of\r\nblood sought the remedy for his malady; or Peter, whose place, Most\r\nHoly Father, you occupy, marched upon the waves when he beheld our\r\nLord. The conditions being accepted, the young men were bound and the\r\neight judges took their places. The signal was given, and each one\r\ncalled upon his zemes, to come to his assistance. The two champions\r\nbeheld the zemes with a long tail and an enormous mouth furnished with\r\nteeth and horns just like the images. This devil sought to untie the\r\nyoung man who was acting as his champion, but at the first invocation\r\nof the Comendador the Virgin appeared. The judges, with wide open eyes\r\nand attentive minds, waited to see what would happen. She touched the\r\ndevil with the wand she was carrying and put him to flight, afterwards\r\ncausing the bonds of her champion to transfer themselves to the body\r\nof his adversary. This miracle struck terror into the Comendador's\r\nenemies, and they recognised that the zemes of the Virgin was more\r\npowerful than their own.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this event was, that when the news spread that\r\nChristians had landed in Cuba, the Comendador's neighbours, who were\r\nhis bitter enemies, and had often made war upon him, sent to Enciso\r\nasking for priests to baptise them. Enciso immediately despatched two\r\npriests who were with him, and in one day one hundred and thirty men\r\nof the Comendador's enemies were baptised and became his firm friends\r\nand allies. We have in another place noted that chickens had greatly\r\nincreased in the country, owing to the care of our compatriots. Each\r\nnative who had received baptism presented the priest with a cock or\r\na hen, but not with a capon, because they have not yet learned to\r\ncastrate the chickens and make capons of them. They also brought\r\nsalted fish and cakes made of fresh flour. Six of the neophytes\r\naccompanied the priests when they returned to the coasts, carrying\r\nthese presents, which procured the Spaniards a splendid Easter. They\r\nhad left Darien only two days before the Sunday of St. Lazarus, and\r\nEaster overtook them when they were doubling the last promontory of\r\nCuba. In response to the petition of the Comendador they left with him\r\na Spaniard, who volunteered for the purpose of teaching the cacique's\r\nsubjects and their neighbours the Angelic Salutation, their idea being\r\nthat the more words of the prayer to the Virgin they knew, the better\r\ndisposed she would be to them.\r\n\r\nEnciso agreed, after which he resumed his course to Hispaniola, which\r\nwas not far distant. From thence he betook himself to the King, who\r\nwas then in residence at Valladolid, where I talked intimately with\r\nhim. Enciso seriously influenced the King against the adventurer Vasco\r\nNuñez, and secured his condemnation. I have wished, Most Holy Father,\r\nto furnish you these particulars concerning the religion of the\r\nnatives. They reach me not only from Enciso, but from a number of\r\nother most trustworthy personages. I have done this, that Your\r\nBeatitude might be convinced of the docility of this race, and the\r\nease with which they might be instructed in the ceremonies of our\r\nreligion. Their conversion is not to be accomplished from one day to\r\nanother, and it is only little by little that they will accept the\r\nevangelical law, of which you are the dispenser. Thus shall you see\r\nthe number of the sheep composing your flock increased each day. But\r\nlet us return to the story of the envoys from Darien.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe journey from Darien to Hispaniola may be made in eight days\r\nor even less, if the wind is astern. Because of storms the envoys\r\noccupied a hundred days in crossing. They stopped some days at\r\nHispaniola where they transacted their business with the Admiral and\r\nthe other officials, after which they embarked on the merchant vessels\r\nwhich lay ready freighted and plied between Hispaniola and Spain. It\r\nwas not, however, till the calends of May of the year after their\r\ndeparture from Darien, that they arrived at the capital. Quevedo and\r\nColmenares, the two envoys of the colonists of Darien, arrived there\r\non the fifteenth of May, of the year 1513. Coming as they did from\r\nthe Antipodes, from a country hitherto unknown and inhabited by naked\r\npeople, they were received with honour by Juan de Fonseca, to whom the\r\ndirection of colonial affairs had been entrusted. In recognition of\r\nhis fidelity to his sovereigns, other popes have successively bestowed\r\non him the bishoprics of Beca, afterwards Cordova, Palencia, and\r\nRosano; and Your Holiness has just now raised him to the bishopric\r\nof Burgos. Being the first Almoner and Counsellor of the King's\r\nhousehold, Your Holiness has in addition appointed him commissary\r\ngeneral for the royal indulgences, and the crusade against the Moors.\r\n\r\nQuevedo and Colmenares were presented by the Bishop of Burgos to the\r\nCatholic King, and the news they brought pleased his Majesty and all\r\nhis courtiers, because of their extreme novelty. A look at these men\r\nis enough to demonstrate the insalubrious climate and temperature of\r\nDarien, for they are as yellow as though they suffered from liver\r\ncomplaint, and are puffy, though they attribute their condition to the\r\nprivations they have endured. I heard about all they had done from the\r\ncaptains Zamudio and Enciso; also through another bachelor of laws,\r\ncalled Baëcia, who had scoured those countries; also from the ship's\r\ncaptain Vincent Yañez [Pinzon], who was familiar with those coasts;\r\nfrom Alonzo Nuñez and from a number of subalterns who had sailed along\r\nthose coasts, under the command of these captains. Not one of those\r\nwho came to Court failed to afford me the pleasure, whether verbally\r\nor in writing, of reporting to me everything he had learned. True\r\nit is that I have been neglectful of many of those reports, which\r\ndeserved to be kept, and have only preserved such as would, in my\r\nopinion, please the lovers of history. Amidst such a mass of material\r\nI am obliged necessarily to omit something in order that my narrative\r\nmay not be too diffuse.\r\n\r\nLet us now relate the events provoked by the arrival of the envoys.\r\nBefore Quevedo and Colmenares arrived, the news had already been\r\nspread of the dramatic end of the first leaders, Hojeda, Nicuesa, and\r\nJuan de la Cosa, that illustrious navigator who had received a royal\r\ncommission as pilot. It was known that the few surviving colonists at\r\nDarien were in a state of complete anarchy, taking no heed to convert\r\nthe simple tribes of that region to our religion and giving no\r\nattention to acquiring information regarding those countries. It was\r\ntherefore decided to send out a representative who would deprive the\r\nusurpers of the power they had seized without the King's license, and\r\ncorrect the first disorders. This mission was entrusted to Pedro Arias\r\nd'Avila, a citizen of Segovia, who was called in Spain by the nickname\r\nof _El Galan_, because of his prowess in the jousts. No sooner was\r\nthis news published at the Court than the envoys from Darien attempted\r\nto deprive Pedro Arias of the command. There were numerous and\r\npressing petitions to the King to accomplish this; but the first\r\nAlmoner, the Bishop of Burgos whose business it is to stop such\r\nintrigues, promptly spoke to the King when informed of this one, in\r\nthe following terms:\r\n\r\n\"Pedro Arias, O Most Catholic King, is a brave man, who has often\r\nrisked his life for Your Majesty, and who we know by long experience\r\nis well adapted to command troops. He signally distinguished himself\r\nin the wars against the Moors, where he comported himself as became\r\na valiant soldier and a prudent officer. In my opinion, it would\r\nbe ungracious to withdraw his appointment in response to the\r\nrepresentations of envious persons. Let this good man, therefore,\r\ndepart under fortunate auspices; let this devoted pupil of Your\r\nMajesty, who has lived from infancy in the palace, depart.\"\r\n\r\nThe King, acting on the advice of the Bishop of Burgos, confirmed the\r\nappointment of Pedro Arias, and even increased the powers conferred\r\nupon him. Twelve hundred soldiers were raised by the Bishop of Burgos,\r\nat the royal expense, to form the troop of Pedro Arias who, with the\r\nmajority of them, left the Court at Valladolid about the calends of\r\nOctober, in the year 1513, for Seville, a town celebrated for its\r\nnumerous population and its wool. It was at Seville that the royal\r\nagents were to equip the remainder of his soldiers and deliver to him\r\nthe provisions and everything necessary for such a great enterprise.\r\nFor it is there that the King has established his office charged\r\nexclusively with colonial affairs. All the merchants, coming and\r\ngoing, appear there to render account of the cargoes they have brought\r\nfrom the new countries, and of the gold they export. This office is\r\ncalled India House.[1]\r\n\r\n[Note 1: _Domum Indicæ Contractationis vocant. Casa de\r\nContractacion_, or Casa de Indias.]\r\n\r\nPedro Arias found two thousand young soldiers in excess of his\r\nnumber awaiting him at Seville; he likewise found a goodly number of\r\navaricious old men, the majority of whom asked merely to be allowed to\r\nfollow him at their own cost, without receiving the royal pay. Rather\r\nthan overcrowd his ships and to spare his supplies, he refused to take\r\nany of the latter. Care was taken that no foreigner should mingle with\r\nthe Spaniards, without the King's permission, and for this reason I am\r\nextremely astonished that a certain Venetian, Aloisió Cadamosto, who\r\nhas written a history of the Portuguese, should write when mentioning\r\nthe actions of the Spaniards, \"We have done; we have seen; we have\r\nbeen\"; when, as a matter of fact, he has neither done nor seen any\r\nmore than any other Venetian. Cadamosto borrowed and plagiarised\r\nwhatever he wrote, from the first three books of my first three\r\nDecades, that is to say, those which I addressed to the Cardinals\r\nAscanio and Arcimboldo, who were living at the time when the events\r\nI described were happening. He evidently thought that my works would\r\nnever be given to the public, and it may be that he came across\r\nthem in the possession of some Venetian ambassador; for the most\r\nillustrious Senate of that Republic sent eminent men to the Court of\r\nthe Catholic Kings, to some of whom I willingly showed my writings. I\r\nreadily consented that copies should be taken. Be that as it may, this\r\nexcellent Aloisió Cadamosto has sought to claim for himself what was\r\nthe work of another. He has related the great deeds of the Portuguese,\r\nbut whether he witnessed them, as he pretends, or has merely profited\r\nby the labour of another, I am unable to state. _Vivat et ipse marte\r\nsuo_.\r\n\r\nNobody, who had not been enrolled by the royal agents, as a soldier,\r\nin the King's pay was allowed to go on board the vessels of Pedro\r\nArias. In addition to these regulars there were some others, including\r\none Francisco Cotta, a compatriot of mine, and thanks to a royal\r\norder I obtained for him, he was allowed to go to the New World as\r\na volunteer with Pedro Arias. But for this he would not have been\r\npermitted to depart. Now let the Venetian, Cadamosto, go on and write\r\nthat he has seen everything, while I, who for twenty-six years have\r\nlived, not without credit, at the Court of the Catholic King, have\r\nonly been able by the greatest efforts to obtain authorisation for\r\none foreigner to sail. Some Genoese, but very few, and that at\r\nthe instance of the Admiral, son of the first discoverer of those\r\ncountries, succeeded in obtaining a like authorisation; but to no one\r\nelse was permission granted.\r\n\r\nPedro Arias sailed from Seville on the Guadalquivir to the sea, in the\r\nfirst days of the year 1514.[2] His departure took place under evil\r\nauspices, for such a furious storm broke over the fleet that two\r\nvessels were shattered to pieces, and the others were obliged to\r\nlighten themselves by throwing overboard some of their stores. The\r\ncrews which survived returned to the coast of Spain, where the King's\r\nagents promptly came to their assistance and they were enabled again\r\nto set forth. The pilot of the flagship appointed by the King was\r\nGiovanni Vespucci, a Florentine, nephew of Amerigo Vespucci, who had\r\ninherited his uncle's great ability in the art of navigation and\r\ntaking reckonings. We recently learned from Hispaniola that the\r\ncrossing had been favourable, and a merchant ship, returning from the\r\nneighbouring islands, had encountered the fleet.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: The expedition sailed on April 14, 1514.]\r\n\r\nAs Galeazzo Butrigario and Giovanni Accursi who, to please Your\r\nHoliness, constantly urge me on, are sending a courier who will\r\ndeliver my ocean Nereids, however imperfect they may be, to Your\r\nBeatitude, I shall save time by leaving out many particulars and shall\r\nonly mention what, in my opinion, is worthy to be recorded and which I\r\nhave not reported at the time it happened.\r\n\r\nThe wife of the captain Pedro Arias, by name Elizabeth Bobadilla, is\r\nthe grandniece on the father's side of the Marchioness Bobadilla de\r\nMoia, who opened the gates of Segovia to the friends of Isabella when\r\nthe Portuguese were invading Castile, thus enabling them to hold out\r\nand later to take the offensive against the Portuguese; and still\r\nlater to defeat them. King Henry, brother of Queen Isabella, had in\r\nfact taken possession of the treasures of that town. During her entire\r\nlife, whether in time of war or in time of peace, the Marchioness de\r\nMoia displayed virile resolution, and it was due to her counsels that\r\nmany great deeds were done in Castile. The wife of Pedro Arias, being\r\nniece of this marchioness, and inspired by courage equal to that of\r\nher aunt, spoke to her husband on his departure for those unknown\r\nlands, where he would encounter real perils, both on sea and on land,\r\nin the following terms:\r\n\r\n\"My dear husband, we have been united from our youth, as I think, for\r\nthe purpose of living together and never being separated. Wherever\r\ndestiny may lead you, be it on the tempestuous ocean or be it among\r\nthe hardships that await you on land, I should be your companion.\r\nThere is nothing I would more fear, nor any kind of death that might\r\nthreaten me, which would not be more supportable than for me to live\r\nwithout you and separated by such an immense distance. I would rather\r\ndie and even be eaten by fish in the sea or devoured on land by\r\ncannibals, than to consume myself in perpetual mourning and in\r\nunceasing sorrow, awaiting--not my husband--but his letters. My\r\ndetermination is not sudden nor unconsidered; nor is it a woman's\r\ncaprice that moves me to a well-weighed and merited decision. You must\r\nchoose between two alternatives. Either you will kill me or you will\r\ngrant my request. The children God has given us (there were eight of\r\nthem, four boys and four girls) will not stop me for one moment. We\r\nwill leave them their heritage and their marriage portions, sufficient\r\nto enable them to live in conformity with their rank, and besides\r\nthese, I have no other preoccupation.\"\r\n\r\nUpon hearing his wife speak such words from her virile heart, the\r\nhusband knew that nothing could shake her resolution, and therefore,\r\ndared not refuse her request. She followed him as Ipsicratea, with\r\nflowing hair, followed Mithridates, for she loved her living husband\r\nas did the Carian Artemisia of Halicarnassia her dead Mausolus. We\r\nhave learned that this Elizabeth Bobadilla brought up, as the proverb\r\nsays, on soft feathers, has braved the dangers of the ocean with as\r\nmuch courage as her husband or the sailors who pass their lives at\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe following are some other particulars I have noted. In my First\r\nDecade I spoke, and not without some praise, of Vincent Yañez Pinzon,\r\nwho had accompanied the Genoese, Christopher Columbus, the future\r\nAdmiral, on his first voyage. Later, he undertook, by himself and at\r\nhis own cost, another voyage, with but one ship for which he received\r\nthe royal license. During the year preceding the departure of Hojeda\r\nand Nicuesa, Vincent Yañez undertook a third exploration, sailing from\r\nHispaniola. His course was from east to west, following the southern\r\nshore of Cuba, which, owing to its length, many people at that time\r\nthought a continent; and he sailed round it. Many other persons have\r\nsince reported that they have done the same.\r\n\r\nHaving demonstrated by this expedition that Cuba was indeed an island,\r\nVincent Yañez sailed farther, and discovered other lands west of Cuba,\r\nbut such as the Admiral had first touched. He kept to the left and,\r\nfollowing the continental coasts towards the east, he crossed the\r\ngulfs of Veragua, Uraba, and Cachibacoa, touching finally with his\r\nship at the region which, in our First Decade, we have explained was\r\ncalled Paria and Boca de la Sierpe. He sailed into an immense gulf\r\nnoted by Columbus as remarkable for its fresh waters, the abundance of\r\nfish, and the many islands it contained. It is situated about thirty\r\nmiles east of Curiana. Midway in this course Cumana and Manacapana\r\nare passed; and it is at these places, not at Curiana, where the most\r\npearls are found.\r\n\r\nThe kings of that country, who are called _chiaconus_ just as they are\r\ncalled caciques in Hispaniola, sent messengers when they learned of\r\nthe Spaniards' arrival, to ascertain who the unknown men might be,\r\nwhat they brought with them, and what they wanted. They launched\r\nupon the sea their barques dug out of tree trunks which are the same\r\nmentioned in our First Decade, and are called canoes in Hispaniola;\r\nbut here the natives called them _chicos_. What most astonished them\r\nwas to see the swelling sails of the ship, for they did not understand\r\nthe use of sails; and if they did they would only require small ones,\r\nbecause of the narrowness of their barques. They approached the ship\r\nin great numbers and even ventured to shoot some arrows at the men who\r\ndefended the ship's sides as though they were walls, hoping either to\r\nwound or frighten them.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards fired their cannon, and the natives, alarmed by the\r\ndetonation and by the slaughter that resulted from the well-aimed\r\nshot, took to flight in various directions. Pursuing them with a\r\nship's boat, the Spaniards killed some and took many prisoners. The\r\nnoise of the cannon and the report of what had happened so alarmed the\r\ncaciques, who feared their villages would be robbed and their people\r\nmassacred if the Spaniards landed to take vengeance, that they sent\r\nmessengers to Vincent Yañez. As far as could be understood from their\r\nsigns and gestures they sought peace; but our compatriots report\r\nthat they did not understand a word of their language. The better to\r\ndemonstrate their desire for peace, the natives made them beautiful\r\npresents, consisting of a quantity of gold, equal in weight to three\r\nthousand of the kind of coins we have said are called castellanos, and\r\nin vulgar language pesos; also a wooden tub full of precious incense,\r\nweighing about twenty-six hundred pounds, at eight ounces to the\r\npound. This showed the country was rich in incense, for the natives of\r\nParia have no intercourse with those of Saba; and in fact they know\r\nnothing of any place outside their own country. In addition to the\r\ngold and the incense, they presented peacocks such as are not found\r\nelsewhere, for they differ largely from ours in the variety of their\r\ncolours. The hens were alive, for they kept them to propagate the\r\nspecies, but the cocks, which they brought in great numbers, were\r\ndressed to be immediately eaten. They likewise offered cotton stuffs,\r\nsimilar to tapestries, for household decoration, very tastefully made\r\nin various colours. These stuffs were fringed with golden bells such\r\nas are called in Italy _sonaglios_ and in Spain _cascabeles_. Of\r\ntalking parrots, they gave as many of different colours as were\r\nwanted; these parrots are as common in Paria as pigeons or sparrows\r\nare amongst us.\r\n\r\nAll the natives wear cotton clothing, the men being covered to the\r\nknees, and the women to the calves of their legs. In time of war the\r\nmen wear a carefully quilted coat of cotton, doubled in the Turkish\r\nstyle. I have used the word cotton for what I have otherwise called in\r\nthe vulgar Italian _bombasio_. I have also used other analogous terms\r\nwhich certain Latinists, dwelling along the Adriatic or Ligurian\r\ncoasts, may attribute to my negligence or ignorance, when my writings\r\nreach them,[3] as we have seen in the case of my First Decade which\r\nwas printed without my authorisation. I would have them know that I\r\nam a Lombard, not a Latin; that I was born at Milan,[4] a long way\r\ndistant from Latium, and have lived my life still farther away, for I\r\nreside in Spain. Let those purists of Venice or Genoa who accuse me of\r\nimproprieties of composition because I have written as one speaks\r\nin Spain of brigantines and caravels, of admiral and adelantado,\r\nunderstand, once for all, that I am not ignorant that he who holds\r\nthese offices is called by the Hellenists _Archithalassus_ and by the\r\nLatinists sometimes _Navarchus_ and sometimes _Pontarchus_. Despite\r\nall such similar comments, and provided I may nourish the hope of not\r\ndispleasing Your Holiness, I shall confine myself to narrating these\r\ngreat events with simplicity. Leaving these things aside, let us now\r\nreturn to the caciques of Paria.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: Peter Martyr was not ignorant of the jibes his Latin\r\nevoked amongst the purists in Rome. The cultivated tympanum of\r\nCardinal Bembo and other Ciceronians at the Pontifical Court received\r\npainful shocks from certain corrupt expressions in his decades. His\r\nrepeated explanations of his deflections from classical nomenclature\r\nare, however, reasonable.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Meaning, of course, in the duchy, not the city. The\r\npassage reads: _Neutro cruciare statuo ad summum; voloque sciant, me\r\ninsubrem esse non Latium; et longe a Latio natum, quia Mediolani; et\r\nlongissime vitam egisse, quia in Hispania_.]\r\n\r\nVincent Yañez discovered that the chieftains were elected for only one\r\nyear. Their followers obeyed them in making war or in signing peace.\r\nTheir villages are built around this immense gulf. Five of these\r\ncaciques offered gifts to the Spaniards, and I have wished to record\r\ntheir names in memory of their hospitality: Chiaconus Chianaocho,\r\nChiaconus Fintiguanos, Chiaconus Chamailaba, Chiaconus Polomus,\r\nChiaconus Pot.\r\n\r\nThis gulf is called Bahia de la Natividad, because Columbus discovered\r\nit on the Feast of Christmas; but he only sailed by, without\r\npenetrating into the interior. The Spaniards simply call it Bahia.\r\nHaving established friendship with these chieftains, Vincent Yañez\r\ncontinued his voyage[5] and found to the east countries which had been\r\nabandoned because of frequent inundations, and a vast extent of marsh\r\nlands. He persisted in his undertaking until he reached the extreme\r\npoint of the continent[6]; if indeed we may call points, those corners\r\nor promontories which terminate a coast. This one seems to reach out\r\ntowards the Atlas, and therefore opposite that part of Africa called\r\nby the Portuguese the Cape of Good Hope, a promontory in the ocean\r\nformed by the prolongation of the Atlas Mountains. The Cape of Good\r\nHope, however, is situated within thirty-four degrees of the antarctic\r\npole, whereas this point in the New World lies within the seventh\r\ndegree. I think it must be part of that continent which cosmographers\r\nhave named the Great Atlantis, but without giving further details as\r\nto its situation or character.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: Comparing this account of Pinzon's voyage with that\r\nof Vespucci, it is seen that Peter Martyr describes the itinerary\r\nreversed, making Pinzon finish where Vespucci makes him begin.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6: Cape Sant Augustin.]\r\n\r\nAnd since we have now reached the shores of the first land encountered\r\nbeyond the Pillars of Hercules, perhaps it may not be out of place to\r\nsay something of the motives which might have provoked war between the\r\nCatholic King, Ferdinand of Spain, and Emanuel of Portugal, had they\r\nnot been father-in-law and son-in-law. Note that I say _Portugal_ and\r\nnot _Lusitania_, contrary to the opinion of many persons who certainly\r\nare not ignorant, but are not less certainly, sadly mistaken. For if\r\nit be Lusitania which eminent geographers locate between the Douro and\r\nthe Guadiana, in what part of Lusitania does Portugal lie?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of King John of Portugal, uncle and predecessor of\r\nKing Emanuel, now happily reigning, a serious divergence existed\r\nbetween the Portuguese and the Spaniards concerning their discoveries.\r\nThe King of Portugal claimed that he alone possessed navigation rights\r\non the ocean, because the Portuguese had been the first since ancient\r\ntimes to put out on the great sea. The Castilians asserted that\r\neverything existing on the earth since God created the world is the\r\ncommon property of mankind, and that it is, therefore, permissible to\r\ntake possession of any country not already inhabited by Christians.\r\nThe discussion on this point was very involved, and it was finally\r\ndecided to leave it to the arbitration of the Sovereign Pontiff.\r\nCastile was at that time governed by the great Queen Isabella, with\r\nwhom was associated her husband, for Castile was her marriage portion.\r\nThe Queen being cousin to King John of Portugal, an agreement\r\nbetween them was speedily reached. By mutual consent of both parties\r\nconcerned, and by virtue of a bull, the Sovereign Pontiff, Alexander\r\nVI., under whose pontificate this discussion took place, traced from\r\nnorth to south a line lying one hundred leagues outside the parallel\r\nof the Cape Verde Islands.[1] The extreme point of the continent lies\r\non this side of that line and is called Cape San Augustin, and by\r\nthe terms of the Bull the Castilians are forbidden to land on that\r\nextremity of the continent.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: The famous bull marking the respective spheres of\r\ndiscovery and colonisation for Spain and Portugal was given on May\r\n4, 1493. Its terms were revised by the two states whose claims were\r\nfinally embodied in the conventions of Tordesillas, June 7, 1494, and\r\nSetubal, September 4, 1494.]\r\n\r\nAfter collecting the gold given him by the natives of the fertile\r\nprovince of Chamba, Vincent Yañez returned from Cape San Augustin and\r\ndirected his course towards a lofty mountain chain which he saw on the\r\nsouthern horizon. He had taken some prisoners in the Gulf of Paria,\r\nwhich, beyond contest, lies in the Spanish dominions. He conducted\r\nthem to Hispaniola, where he delivered them to the young Admiral to be\r\ninstructed in our language, and afterwards to serve as interpreters in\r\nthe exploration of unknown countries. Pinzon betook himself to court\r\nand petitioned the King for authorisation to assume the title of\r\nGovernor of the island of San Juan, which is only twenty-five leagues\r\ndistant from Hispaniola. He based his claim upon the fact that he had\r\nbeen the first to discover the existence of gold in that island, which\r\nwe have said in our First Decade was called by the Indians Borrichena.\r\n\r\nThe governor of Borrichena, a Portuguese named Christopher, son of\r\nCount Camigua, was massacred by the cannibals of the neighbouring\r\nislands, together with all the Christians except the bishop and his\r\nservants; the latter only succeeded in escaping, at the cost of\r\nabandoning the sacred vessels. In response to the King's solicitation,\r\nyour Apostolic Holiness had just divided this country into five new\r\nbishoprics. The Franciscan friar, Garcias de Padilla, was made Bishop\r\nof Santo Domingo, the capital of Hispaniola; the doctor Pedro Suarez\r\nDeza was appointed to Concepcion, and for the island of San Juan, the\r\nlicenciate Alonzo Mauso was named; both these latter being observants\r\nof the congregation of St. Peter. The fourth bishop was the friar\r\nBernardo de Mesa, a noble Toledan, and an orator of the Dominican\r\nOrder, who was appointed for Cuba. The fifth received the holy oils\r\nfrom Your Holiness for the colony of Darien; he is a Franciscan, a\r\nbrilliant orator, and is called Juan Cabedo.\r\n\r\nAn expedition will, for the following reason, shortly set out to\r\npunish the Caribs. After the first massacre, they returned several\r\nmonths later from the neighbouring island of Santa Cruz, murdered\r\nand ate a cacique who was our ally, with all his family, afterwards\r\ncompletely destroying his town. They alleged that this cacique had\r\nviolated the laws of hospitality in his relations with several Caribs,\r\nwho were boat-builders. These men had been left at San Juan to build\r\nmore canoes, since that island grows lofty trees, better adapted for\r\ncanoe building than are those of the island of Santa Cruz. The Caribs\r\nbeing still on the island, the Spaniards who arrived from Hispaniola\r\nencountered them by accident. When the interpreters had made known\r\nthis recent crime, the Spaniards wished to exact satisfaction, but the\r\ncannibals, drawing their bows and aiming their sharpened arrows at\r\nthem, gave it to be understood with menacing glances that they had\r\nbetter keep quiet unless they wished to provoke a disaster. Fearing\r\nthe poisoned arrows and being likewise unprepared for fighting, our\r\nmen made amicable signs. When they asked the Caribs why they had\r\ndestroyed the village and murdered the cacique and his family, the\r\nlatter replied that they had done so to avenge the murder of several\r\nworkmen. They had collected the bones of the victims with the\r\nintention of carrying them to the widows and children of the workmen,\r\nso that the latter might understand that the murder of their husbands\r\nand fathers had not been left unavenged. They exhibited a pile of\r\nbones to the Spaniards who, shocked by this crime but forced to\r\nconceal their real sentiments, remained silent, not daring to reprove\r\nthe Caribs, Similar stories which I suppress rather than offend\r\nthe ears of Your Holiness by such abominable narratives, are daily\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nBut we have strayed, O Most Holy Father, rather far from the regions\r\nof Veragua and Uraba, which are the chief themes of our discourse.\r\nShall we not first treat of the immensity and the depth of the rivers\r\nof Uraba, and of the products of the countries washed by their waters?\r\nShall I say nothing about the extent of the continent from east to\r\nwest, or of its breadth from north to south, nor of anything that\r\nis reported concerning those regions as yet unknown? Let us return,\r\ntherefore, Most Holy Father, to Uraba, and begin by stating the new\r\nnames which have been given to those provinces, since they have come\r\nunder the authority of Christians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards decided to name Veragua, _Castilla del Oro_, and Uraba,\r\n_Nueva Andalusia_. As Hispaniola had been chosen to be the capital of\r\nall the colonies of the islands, so likewise were the vast regions of\r\nParia divided into two parts, Uraba and Veragua, where two colonies\r\nwere established to serve as refuges and places of rest and\r\nreprovisionment for all those who traversed those countries.\r\n\r\nEverything the Spaniards sowed or planted in Uraba grew marvellously\r\nwell. Is this not worthy, Most Holy Father, of the highest admiration?\r\nEvery kind of seed, graftings, sugar-canes, and slips of trees and\r\nplants, without speaking of the chickens and quadrupeds I have\r\nmentioned, were brought from Europe. O admirable fertility! The\r\ncucumbers and other similar vegetables sown were ready for picking in\r\nless than twenty days. Cabbages, beets, lettuces, salads, and other\r\ngarden stuff were ripe within ten days; pumpkins and melons were\r\npicked twenty-eight days after the seeds were sown. The slips and\r\nsprouts, and such of our trees as we plant out in nurseries or\r\ntrenches, as well as the graftings of trees similar to those in Spain,\r\nbore fruit as quickly as in Hispaniola.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Darien have different kinds of fruit trees, whose\r\nvaried taste and good quality answer to their needs. I would like to\r\ndescribe the more remarkable ones.\r\n\r\nThe _guaiana_ produces a lemon-like fruit similar to those commonly\r\ncalled limes. Their flavour is sharp, but they are pleasant to the\r\ntaste. Nut-bearing pines are common, as are likewise various sorts of\r\npalms bearing dates larger than ours but too sour to be eaten. The\r\ncabbage palm grows everywhere, spontaneously, and is used both for\r\nfood and making brooms. There is a tree called _guaranana_, larger\r\nthan orange trees, and bearing a fruit about the size of a lemon; and\r\nthere is another closely resembling the chestnut. The fruit of\r\nthe latter is larger than a fig, and is pleasant to the taste and\r\nwholesome. The _mamei_ bears a fruit about the size of an orange which\r\nis as succulent as the best melon. The _guaranala_ bears a smaller\r\nfruit than the foregoing, but of an aromatic scent and exquisite\r\ntaste. The _hovos_ bears a fruit resembling in its form and flavour\r\nour plum, though it is somewhat larger, and appears really to be the\r\nmirobolan, which grows so abundantly in Hispaniola that the pigs are\r\nfed on its fruit. When it is ripe it is in vain the swineherd seeks to\r\nkeep his pigs, for they evade him and rush to the forest where these\r\ntrees grow; and it is for this reason that wild swine are so numerous\r\nin Hispaniola. It is also claimed that the pork of Hispaniola has a\r\nsuperior taste and is more wholesome than ours; and, indeed, nobody is\r\nignorant of the fact that diversity of foodstuffs produces firmer and\r\nmore savoury meat.\r\n\r\nThe most invincible King Ferdinand relates that he has eaten another\r\nfruit brought from those countries. It is like a pine-nut in form and\r\ncolour, covered with scales, and firmer than a melon. Its flavour\r\nexcels all other fruits.[1] This fruit, which the King prefers to all\r\nothers, does not grow upon a tree but upon a plant, similar to an\r\nartichoke or an acanthus. I myself have not tasted it, for it was the\r\nonly one which had arrived unspoiled, the others having rotted during\r\nthe long voyage. Spaniards who have eaten them fresh plucked where\r\nthey grow, speak with the highest appreciation of their delicate\r\nflavour. There are certain roots which the natives call potatoes and\r\nwhich grow spontaneously.[2] The first time I saw them, I took them\r\nfor Milanese turnips or huge mushrooms. No matter how they are cooked,\r\nwhether roasted or boiled, they are equal to any delicacy and indeed\r\nto any food. Their skin is tougher than mushrooms or turnips, and is\r\nearth-coloured, while the inside is quite white. The natives sow and\r\ncultivate them in gardens as they do the yucca, which I have mentioned\r\nin my First Decade; and they also eat them raw. When raw they taste\r\nlike green chestnuts, but are a little sweeter.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: The pineapple.]\r\n\r\n[Note 2: This is the first mention in literature of the potato.]\r\n\r\nHaving discoursed of trees, vegetables, and fruits, let us now come to\r\nliving creatures. Besides the lions and tigers[3] and other animals\r\nwhich we already know, or which have been described by illustrious\r\nwriters, the native forests of these countries harbour many monsters.\r\nOne animal in particular has Nature created in prodigious form. It is\r\nas large as a bull, and has a trunk like an elephant; and yet it is\r\nnot an elephant. Its hide is like a bull's, and yet it is not a bull.\r\nIts hoofs resemble those of a horse, but it is not a horse. It has\r\nears like an elephant's, though smaller and drooping, yet they are\r\nlarger than those of any other animal.[4] There is also an animal\r\nwhich lives in the trees, feeds upon fruits, and carries its young in\r\na pouch in the belly; no writer as far as I know has seen it, but I\r\nhave already sufficiently described it in the Decade which has already\r\nreached Your Holiness before your elevation, as it was then stolen\r\nfrom me to be printed.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: It is hardly necessary to say that there were no lions or\r\ntigers in America. Jaguars, panthers, leopards, and ocelots were the\r\nmost formidable beasts of prey found in the virgin forests of the New\r\nWorld.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4: This puzzling animal was the tapir.]\r\n\r\nIt now remains for me to speak of the rivers of Uraba. The Darien,\r\nwhich is almost too narrow for the native canoes, flows into the Gulf\r\nof Uraba, and on its banks stands a village built by the Spaniards.\r\nVasco Nuñez explored the extremity of the gulf and discovered a river\r\none league broad and of the extraordinary depth of two hundred cubits,\r\nwhich flows into the gulf by several mouths, just as the Danube flows\r\ninto the Black Sea, or the Nile waters the land of Egypt. It is\r\ncalled, because of its size, Rio Grande. An immense number of huge\r\ncrocodiles live in the waters of this stream, which, as we know,\r\nis the case with the Nile; particularly I, who have ascended and\r\ndescended that river on my embassy to the Sultan.[5]\r\n\r\n[Note 5: See _De Legatione Babylonica_.]\r\n\r\nI hardly know, after reading the writings of many men remarkable for\r\ntheir knowledge and veracity, what to think of the Nile. It is claimed\r\nthat there are really two Niles, which take their rise either in the\r\nMountains of the Sun or of the Moon, or in the rugged Sierras of\r\nEthiopia. The waters of these streams, whatever be their source,\r\nmodify the nature of the land they traverse. One of the two flows to\r\nthe north and empties into the Egyptian Sea: the other empties into\r\nthe southern ocean. What conclusion shall we draw? We are not puzzled\r\nby the Nile of Egypt, and the southern Nile has been discovered by the\r\nPortuguese, who, in the course of their amazing expeditions, ventured\r\nbeyond the equinoctial line into the country of the negroes, and as\r\nfar as Melinde. They affirm that it rises in the Mountains of the\r\nMoon, and that it is another Nile, since crocodiles are seen there,\r\nand crocodiles only live in streams belonging to the basin of the\r\nNile. The Portuguese have named that river Senegal. It traverses the\r\ncountry of the negroes, and the country on its northern banks is\r\nadmirable, while that on its southern banks is sandy and arid. From\r\ntime to time crocodiles are seen.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we now say about this third, or in fact, this fourth Nile?\r\nThese animals, covered with scales as hard as the tortoise-shell the\r\nSpaniards under Columbus found in that river, and which, as we have\r\nsaid, caused them to name that stream Los Lagartos, are certainly\r\ncrocodiles. Shall we declare that these Niles rise in the Mountains of\r\nthe Moon? Certainly not, Most Holy Father. Other waters than those\r\nof the Nile may produce crocodiles, and our recent explorers have\r\nsupplied proof of this fact, for the rivers do not flow from the\r\nMountains of the Moon, nor can they have the same source as the\r\nEgyptian Nile, or the Nile of Negricia or of Melinde; for they flow\r\ndown from the mountains we have mentioned, rising between the north\r\nand south sea, and which separate the two oceans by a very small\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThe swamps of Darien and the lands which are covered with water after\r\nthe inundations, are full of pheasants, peacocks of sober colours,\r\nand many other birds different from ours. They are good to eat, and\r\ndelight the ear of the listener with various songs; but the Spaniards\r\nare indifferent bird-hunters, and are neglectful in catching them.\r\nInnumerable varieties of parrots, all belonging to the same species,\r\nchatter in this forest; some of them are as large as capons, while\r\nothers are no bigger than a sparrow. I have already enlarged\r\nsufficiently on the subject of parrots in my First Decade. When\r\nColumbus first explored these immense countries he brought back a\r\nlarge number of every kind, and everybody was able to inspect them.\r\nOthers are still daily brought here.\r\n\r\nThere is still, Most Holy Father, a subject which is quite worthy to\r\nfigure in history, but I would prefer to see it handled by a Cicero\r\nor a Livy than by myself. It affords me such astonishment that I feel\r\nmore embarrassed in my description than a young chicken wrapped in\r\ntow. We have said that, according to the Indians, the land separating\r\nthe north from the south sea can be traversed in six days. I am not a\r\nlittle puzzled both by the number and size of the rivers described,\r\nand by the small breadth of that stretch of land; nor do I understand\r\nhow such large rivers can possibly flow down from these mountains,\r\nonly three days' march from the sea, and empty into the north ocean.\r\nI cannot understand it, for I presume that equally large rivers empty\r\ninto the south sea. Doubtless the rivers of Uraba are not so important\r\nwhen compared with others, but the Spaniards declare that during the\r\nlifetime of Columbus they discovered and have since sailed upon a\r\nriver the breadth of whose mouth, where it empties into the sea, is\r\nnot less than one hundred miles. This river is on the borders of\r\nParia, and descends with such force from the high mountains that it\r\noverwhelms the sea even at high tide or when it is swept by violent\r\nwinds, driving back the waves before the fury and weight of its\r\ncurrent. The waters of the sea for a large area round about are no\r\nlonger salt but fresh, and pleasant to the taste. The Indians call\r\nthis river Maragnon.[6] Other tribes give it the names Mariatambal,\r\nCamamoros, or Paricora. In addition to the rivers I have before\r\nmentioned, the Darien, Rio Grande, Dobaiba, San Matteo, Veragua,\r\nBoiogatti, Lagartos, and Gaira, there are also others which water the\r\ncountry. I wonder, Most Holy Father, what must be the size of these\r\nmountain caverns so near the seacoast, and, according to the Indians,\r\nso narrow, and what sources they have to enable them to send forth\r\nsuch torrents of water? Several explanations suggest themselves to my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n[Note 6: Just which river is meant is not clear. The description\r\nwould seem to fit the Orinoco, but Maragnon is the native name for the\r\nAmazon. This last name is given exclusively to the upper part of the\r\nriver in the Peruvian territory.]\r\n\r\nThe first is the size of the mountains. It is claimed that they are\r\nvery great and this was the opinion of Columbus, who discovered them.\r\nHe had also another theory, asserting that the terrestrial paradise\r\nwas situated on the top of the mountains visible from Paria and Boca\r\nde la Sierpe. He ended by convincing himself that this was a fact.\r\nIf these mountains are so immense, they must contain extensive and\r\ngigantic reservoirs.\r\n\r\nIf such be the case, how are these reservoirs supplied with water? Is\r\nit true, as many people think, that all fresh waters flow from the\r\nsea into the land, where they are forced by the terrible power of the\r\nwaves into subterranean passages of the earth, just as we see it pour\r\nforth from those same channels to flow again into the ocean?\r\n\r\nThis may well be the explanation of the phenomenon, since, if the\r\nreports of the natives be true, nowhere else will two seas, separated\r\nby such a small extent of land, ever be found. On the one side a vast\r\nocean extends towards the setting sun; on the other lies an ocean\r\ntowards the rising sun; and the latter is just as large as the former,\r\nfor it is believed that it mingles with the Indian Ocean. If this\r\ntheory be true, the continent, bounded by such an extent of water,\r\nmust necessarily absorb immense quantities, and after taking it up,\r\nmust send it forth into the sea in the form of rivers. If we deny that\r\nthe continent absorbs the excess of water from the ocean, and admit\r\nthat all springs derive their supply from the rainfall which filters\r\ndrop by drop into mountain reservoirs, we do so, bowing rather to the\r\nsuperior authority of those who hold this opinion, than because our\r\nreason grasps this theory.\r\n\r\nI share the view that the clouds are converted into water, which is\r\nabsorbed into the mountain caverns, for I have seen with my own eyes\r\nin Spain, rain falling drop by drop incessantly into caverns from\r\nwhence brooks flowed down the mountainside, watering the olive\r\norchards, vineyards and gardens of all kinds. The most illustrious\r\nCardinal Ludovico of Aragon, who is so devotedly attached to you, and\r\ntwo Italian bishops, one of Boviano, Silvio Pandono, and the other,\r\nan Archbishop whose own name and that of his diocese I am unable to\r\nrecollect, will bear me witness. We were together at Granada when it\r\nwas captured from the Moors, and to divert ourselves we used to go to\r\nsome wooded hills, whence a murmuring rivulet flowed across the plain.\r\nWhile our most illustrious Ludovico went bird-hunting with his bow\r\nalong its banks, the two bishops and I formed a plan to ascend the\r\nhill to discover the source of the brook, for we were not very far\r\nfrom the top of the mountain. Taking up our soutanes, therefore, and\r\nfollowing the river-bed, we found a cavern incessantly supplied by\r\ndropping water. From this cavern, the water formed by these drops\r\ntrickled into an artificial reservoir in the rocks at the bottom where\r\nthe rivulet formed. Another such cave filled by the dew is in the\r\ncelebrated town of Valladolid, where we at present reside. It stands\r\nin a vineyard not farther than a stadium from the walls of the town\r\nand belongs to a lawyer, Villena, citizen of Valladolid, and very\r\nlearned in the science of law. Perhaps moisture changed into rain is\r\ncollected in little caves in the rocks and sometimes forms springs,\r\ndue to the infiltration of water in the hills; but I wonder how Nature\r\ncan produce such quantities of water from these meagre infiltrations!\r\nIn my opinion, two causes may be conceded: the first is the frequent\r\nrains; the second, the length in this region of the winter and autumn\r\nseasons. The countries in question are so near to the equinoctial line\r\nthat during the entire year there is no perceptible difference in\r\nlength between the days and nights; during the spring and autumn,\r\nrains are more frequent than in a severe winter or torrid summer.\r\nAnother reason is: if the earth really is porous, and these pores emit\r\nvapours which form clouds charged with water, it will necessarily\r\nfollow that this continent must have a greater rainfall than any other\r\ncountry in the world, because it is narrow and shut in on each side by\r\ntwo immense neighbouring oceans. However it may be, Most Holy Father,\r\nI am quite obliged to believe the reports of the numerous persons who\r\nhave visited the country, and I must record these particulars even\r\nthough they appear for the most part contrary to truth. For this\r\nreason I have desired to expose my arguments, fearing that learned\r\nmen, rejoicing to find occasion for attacking the writings of another,\r\nmay judge me so wanting in judgment as to believe all the tales people\r\ntell me.\r\n\r\nI have described the great estuary formed by the junction of this\r\nimmense volume of fresh water with the sea, and I believe this to be\r\nthe result of the union of a number of rivers coming together in the\r\nform of a lake, rather than a river, as is claimed. I also think the\r\nfresh water rushes down from very high mountains, and pours into the\r\nsalt waters beneath, with such violence that the sea-water cannot\r\npenetrate unto the bay. Doubtless there will be found people who will\r\nexpress astonishment at my imagination, and throw ridicule on me,\r\nsaying, \"Why does he repeat this, as though it were a miracle? Has not\r\nItaly the Po, which illustrious writers have named the king of rivers?\r\nAre not other regions watered by great rivers, such as the Don, the\r\nGanges, the Danube, whose waters drive back those of the sea with such\r\nforce that fresh, potable water is still found forty miles from their\r\nmouths?\" I would answer their objections as follows: in the Alpine\r\nchain rising behind the Po and separating Italy from France, Germany,\r\nand Austria, water never fails. The long valley of the Po also\r\nreceives the waters of the Ticino and many other streams flowing\r\ntowards the Adriatic; and the same may be said of the other rivers\r\nmentioned. But these rivers of the new continent, as the caciques\r\ninformed the Spaniards, flow through greater and shorter channels into\r\nthe ocean. Some people believe that the continent is very narrow in\r\nthis part, and that it spreads; out considerably in other places.\r\nAnother argument, which I hold to be a poor one, I must nevertheless\r\nmention. This continent is narrow, but its length extends for an\r\nimmense distance from the east to the west. Just as is recounted of\r\nthe river Alpheus of Elide, which disappears in channels under the sea\r\nto reappear in Sicily at the fountain of Arethusa, so there may exist\r\nin the mountains of this continent a vast network of subterranean\r\npassages in such wise that the waters produced by the rains we have\r\nmentioned may be collected. Those who explain phenomena by common\r\nsense, and those who enjoy criticism may choose the theory which best\r\npleases them. For the moment there is nothing more I can add on this\r\nsubject. When we shall learn more, we shall faithfully relate it. We\r\nhave already dwelt sufficiently upon the width of this continent, and\r\nit is now time to consider its form and length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK X\r\n\r\n\r\nThis continent extends into the sea exactly like Italy, but is\r\ndissimilar in that it is not the shape of a human leg. Moreover, why\r\nshall we compare a pigmy with a giant? That part of the continent\r\nbeginning at this eastern point lying towards Atlas, which the\r\nSpaniards have explored, is at least eight times larger than Italy;\r\nand its western coast has not yet been discovered. Your Holiness may\r\nwish to know upon what my estimate of _eight times_ is based. From the\r\noutset when I resolved to obey your commands and to write a report\r\nof these events, in Latin (though myself no Latin) I have adopted\r\nprecautions to avoid stating anything which was not fully\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nI addressed myself to the Bishop of Burgos whom I have already\r\nmentioned, and to whom all navigators report. Seated in his room, we\r\nexamined numerous reports of those expeditions, and we have likewise\r\nstudied the terrestrial globe on which the discoveries are indicated,\r\nand also many parchments, called by the explorers navigators' charts.\r\nOne of these maps had been drawn by the Portuguese, and it is claimed\r\nthat Amerigo Vespucci of Florence assisted in its composition. He is\r\nvery skilled in this art, and has himself gone many degrees beyond the\r\nequinoctial line, sailing in the Service and at the expense of the\r\nPortuguese. According to this chart, we found the continent was larger\r\nthan the caciques of Uraba told our compatriots, when guiding them\r\nover the mountains. Columbus, during his lifetime, began another map\r\nwhile exploring these regions, and his brother, Bartholomew Columbus,\r\nAdelantado of Hispaniola, who has also sailed along these coasts,\r\nsupported this opinion by his own judgment. From thenceforth,\r\nevery Spaniard who thought he understood the science of computing\r\nmeasurements, has drawn his own map; the most valuable of these maps\r\nare those made by the famous Juan de la Cosa, companion of Hojeda, who\r\nwas murdered, together with the ship's captain, Andre Moranes, by the\r\nnatives of Caramaira, near the port of Carthagena, as we have already\r\nrecounted. Both these men not only possessed great experience of these\r\nregions, where they were as well acquainted with every bit of the\r\ncoast as with the rooms of their own houses, but they were likewise\r\nreputed to be experts in naval cosmography. When all these maps were\r\nspread out before us, and upon each a scale was marked in the Spanish\r\nfashion, not in miles but in leagues, we set to work to measure the\r\ncoasts with a compass, in the following order:\r\n\r\nFrom the cape or point[1] we have mentioned as being on this side of\r\nthe Portuguese line drawn one hundred leagues west of the Cape Verde\r\nIslands, in the countries thus far visited on both sides of that line,\r\nwe measured three hundred leagues to the mouth of the Maragnon River.\r\nFrom the mouth of this river to Boca de la Sierpe the distance on some\r\nmaps is a little less than seven hundred leagues, for all these charts\r\ndo not agree, since the Spaniards sometimes reckoned by marine leagues\r\nof four thousand paces, and sometimes by land leagues of three\r\nthousand paces. From Boca de la Sierpe to Cape Cuchibacoa, near which\r\nthe coast line bends to the left, we measured about three thousand\r\nleagues. From the promontory of Cuchibacoa to the region of Caramaira,\r\nwhere the port of Carthagena is, the distance is about one hundred and\r\nseventy leagues. From Caramaira to the island of La Fuerte it is fifty\r\nleagues, after which, to the entrance of the Gulf of Uraba where the\r\nvillage of Santa Maria Antigua actually stands, it is only thirty-five\r\nleagues. Between Darien in Uraba, and Veragua where Nicuesa would have\r\nsettled, but that the gods decided otherwise, we measured the distance\r\nto be one hundred and thirty leagues. From Veragua to the river named\r\nby Columbus, San Matteo, on whose banks Nicuesa wasted so much time\r\nand suffered such hardships after losing his caravel, the map showed\r\nonly one hundred and forty leagues, but many of the men who have\r\nreturned from there say the distance is really considerably greater.\r\nMany rivers are indicated just there: for example, the Aburema, before\r\nwhich lies the island called the Scudo di Cateba--whose cacique was\r\nnicknamed Burnt Face: the Zobrabaö--the Urida, and the Doraba with\r\nrich gold deposits. Many remarkable ports are also marked on that\r\ncoast; among them Cesabaron and Hiebra, as they are called by the\r\nnatives. Adding these figures together, Most Holy Father, you will\r\nreach a total of fifteen hundred and twenty-five leagues or five\r\nthousand seven hundred miles from the cape to the Gulf of San Matteo,\r\nwhich is also called the Gulf of Perdidos.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: The most eastern cape on the Brazil coast is Cape San\r\nRocco.]\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. A certain Asturian of Oviedo, Juan de Solis,[2]\r\nbut who declares that he was born at Nebrissa, the country of\r\nillustrious savants, asserts that he sailed westward from San Matteo a\r\ndistance of many leagues. As the coast, bends towards the north, it\r\nis consequently difficult to give exact figures, but three hundred\r\nleagues may be approximately estimated. From the foregoing you may\r\nperceive, Most Holy Father, the length of the continent over which\r\nyour authority is destined to extend. Some day we shall doubtless\r\nclearly understand its width.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: This pilot and cosmographer has already been mentioned.\r\nIn 1515 he was commissioned to explore the coast south of Brazil,\r\nbut, as has been related, he was unfortunately killed during that\r\nexpedition. To just what voyage Peter Martyr here refers is not quite\r\nclear.]\r\n\r\nLet us now discourse a little concerning the variety of polar degrees.\r\nAlthough this continent extends from east to west, it is nevertheless\r\nso crooked, with its point bending so much to the south, that it\r\nloses sight of the polar star, and extends seven degrees beyond the\r\nequinoctial line. This extremity of the continent is, as we have\r\nalready said, within the limits of Portuguese jurisdiction. In\r\nreturning from that extremity towards Paria, the north star again\r\nbecomes visible; the farther the country extends towards the west,\r\nthe nearer does it approach the pole. The Spaniards made different\r\ncalculations up to the time when they were established at Darien,\r\nwhere they founded their principal colony; for they abandoned Veragua,\r\nwhere the north star stood eight degrees above the horizon. Beyond\r\nVeragua the coast bends in a northerly direction, to a point opposite\r\nthe Pillars of Hercules; that is, if we accept for our measures\r\ncertain lands discovered by the Spaniards more than three hundred and\r\ntwenty-five leagues from the northern coast of Hispaniola. Amongst\r\nthese countries is an island called by us Boinca, and by others\r\nAganeo; it is celebrated for a spring whose waters restore youth\r\nto old men.[3] Let not Your Holiness believe this to be a hasty or\r\nfoolish opinion, for the story has been most seriously told to all the\r\ncourt, and made such an impression that the entire populace, and even\r\npeople superior by birth and influence, accepted it as a proven fact.\r\nIf you ask me my opinion on this matter, I will answer that I do not\r\nbelieve any such power exists in creative nature, for I think that God\r\nreserves to himself this prerogative, as well as that of reading\r\nthe hearts of men, or of granting wealth to those who have nothing;\r\nunless, that is to say, we are prepared to believe the Colchian fable\r\nconcerning the renewal of Æson and the researches of the sibyl of\r\nErythræa.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: The reference is to the fabulous waters of eternal\r\nyouth in quest of which Juan Ponce de Leon set forth. The country is\r\nFlorida.]\r\n\r\nWe have now discoursed sufficiently of the length and the breadth of\r\nthis continent, of its rugged mountains and watercourses, as well of\r\nits different regions.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me I should not omit mention of the misfortunes that have\r\novertaken some of our compatriots. When I was a child, my whole\r\nbeing quivered and I was stirred with pity in thinking of Virgil's\r\nAlchimenides who, abandoned by Ulysses in the land of the Cyclops,\r\nsustained life during the period between the departure of Ulysses\r\nand the arrival of Æneas, upon berries and seeds. The Spaniards of\r\nNicuesa's colony of Veragua would certainly have esteemed berries and\r\nseeds delicious eating. Is it necessary to quote as an extraordinary\r\nfact that an ass's head was bought for a high price? Why do many such\r\nthings, similar to those endured during a siege, matter? When Nicuesa\r\ndecided to abandon this sterile and desolate country of Veragua, he\r\nlanded at Porto Bello and on the coast which has since been named Cape\r\nMarmor, hoping to there find a more fertile soil. But such a terrible\r\nfamine overtook his companions that they did not shrink from eating\r\nthe carcasses of mangy dogs they had brought with them for hunting and\r\nas watch-dogs. These dogs were of great use to them in fighting with\r\nthe Indians. They even ate the dead bodies of massacred Indians, for\r\nin that country there are no fruit-trees nor birds as in Darien, which\r\nexplains why it is destitute of inhabitants. Some of them combined to\r\nbuy an emaciated, starving dog, paying its owner a number of golden\r\npesos or castellanos. They skinned the dog and ate him, throwing his\r\nmangy hide and head into the neighbouring bushes. On the following day\r\na Spanish foot-soldier finding the skin, which was already swarming\r\nwith worms and half putrid, carried it away with him. He cleaned off\r\nthe worms and, after cooking the skin in, a pot, he ate it. A number\r\nof his companions came with their bowls to share the soup made from\r\nthat skin, each offering a castellano of gold for a spoonful of soup.\r\nA Castilian who caught two toads cooked them, and a man who was ill\r\nbought them for food, paying two shirts of linen and spun gold which\r\nwere worth quite six castellanos. One day the dead body of an Indian\r\nwho had been killed by the Spaniards was found on the plain, and\r\nalthough it was already putrefying, they secretly cut it into bits\r\nwhich they afterwards boiled or roasted, assuaging their hunger with\r\nthat meat as though it were peacock. During several days a Spaniard,\r\nwho had left camp at night and lost his way amongst the swamps, ate\r\nsuch vegetation as is found in marshes. He finally succeeded in\r\nrejoining his companions, crawling along the ground and half dead.\r\nSuch are the sufferings which these wretched colonists of Veragua\r\nendured.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning there were over seven hundred, and when they joined\r\nthe colonists at Darien hardly more than forty remained. Few had\r\nperished in fighting with the Indians; it was hunger that had\r\nexhausted and killed them. With their blood they paved the way for\r\nthose who follow, and settle in those new countries. Compared with\r\nthese people, the Spaniards under Nicuesa's leadership would seem to\r\nbe bidden to nuptial festivities, for they set out by roads, which are\r\nboth new and secure, towards unexplored countries where they will find\r\ninhabitants and harvests awaiting them. We are still ignorant where\r\nthe captain Pedro Arias, commanding the royal fleet,[4] has landed; if\r\nI learn that it will afford Your Holiness pleasure, I shall faithfully\r\nreport the continuation of events.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: This Decade was written towards the end of the year 1514,\r\nbut although Pedro Arias had landed on June 29th, no news of his\r\nmovements had yet reached Spain. The slowness and uncertainty of\r\ncommunication must be constantly borne in mind by readers.]\r\n\r\nFrom the Court of the Catholic King, the eve of the nones of December,\r\n1514, Anno Domini.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Third Decade\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\nPETER MARTYR, OF MILAN, APOSTOLIC PRONOTARY AND ROYAL COUNSELLOR TO\r\nTHE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF LEO X\r\n\r\n\r\nI had closed the doors of the New World, Most Holy Father, for it\r\nseemed to me I had wandered enough in those regions, when I received\r\nfresh letters which constrained me to reopen those doors and resume my\r\npen. I have already related that after expelling the Captain Nicuesa\r\nand the judge Enciso from the colony of Darien, Vasco Nuñez, with the\r\nconnivance of his companions, usurped the government. We have received\r\nletters[1] both from him and from several of his companions,\r\nwritten in military style, and informing us that he had crossed the\r\nmountain-chain dividing our ocean from the hitherto unknown south sea.\r\nNo letter from Capri concerning Sejanus was ever written in\r\nprouder language. I shall only report the events related in that\r\ncorrespondence which are worthy of mention.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: Two of Balboa's letters are published by Navarrete (tom,\r\niii.,) and may also be read in a French translation made by Gaffarel\r\nand published in his work, _Vasco Nuñez de Balboa_.]\r\n\r\nNot only is Vasco Nuñez reconciled to the Catholic King, who was\r\nformerly vexed with him, but he now enjoys the highest favour. For the\r\nKing has loaded him and the majority of his men with privileges and\r\nhonours, and has rewarded their daring exploits.[2] May Your Holiness\r\nlend an attentive ear to us and listen with serene brow and joyful\r\nheart to our narration, for it is not a few hundreds or legions that\r\nthe Spanish nation has conquered and brought into subjection to your\r\nsacred throne but, thanks to their various achievements and the\r\nthousand dangers to which they expose themselves, myriads who have\r\nbeen subdued.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Balboa had been named Adelantado of the South Sea, and of\r\nthe Panama and Coiba regions. Pedro Arias was also enjoined to counsel\r\nwith him concerning all measures of importance.]\r\n\r\nVasco Nuñez ill endured inaction, for his is an ardent nature,\r\nimpatient of repose, and perhaps he feared that another might rob him\r\nof the honour of the discovery, for it is believed that he had learned\r\nof the appointment given to Pedro Arias.[3] It may well be that to\r\nthese two motives was added fear, knowing the King was vexed with his\r\nconduct in the past. At all events he formed the plan to undertake,\r\nwith a handful of men, the conquest of the country for whose\r\nsubjection the son of the cacique of Comogra declared not less than\r\na thousand soldiers to be necessary. He summoned around him some\r\nveterans of Darien and the majority of those who had come from\r\nHispaniola in the hope of finding gold, thus forming a small troop\r\nof a hundred and ninety men, with whom he set out on the calends of\r\nSeptember of the past year, 1513.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: This was the case; his friend Zamudio had notified Balboa\r\nof the appointment of Pedro Arias.]\r\n\r\nDesiring to accomplish as much of the journey as possible by sea,\r\nhe embarked on a brigantine and ten native barques dug out of tree\r\ntrunks, and first landed in the country of his ally Careca, cacique\r\nof Coiba. Leaving his ships, he implored the divine blessing upon his\r\nundertaking and marched directly towards the mountains. He traversed\r\nthe country subject to the cacique Poncha, who fled, as he had done\r\non other occasions. Acting on the advice of the guides furnished by\r\nCareca, Vasco sent messengers to Poncha, promising his friendship and\r\nprotection against his enemies, and other advantages. The cacique,\r\nwon by these promises and amiabilities and by those of the people of\r\nCareca, joined the Spaniards, and with great alacrity concluded an\r\nalliance with them. Vasco entreated him to have no further fears.\r\nThey shook hands and embraced and exchanged numerous presents, Poncha\r\ngiving about one hundred and ten pesos of gold valued at a castellano\r\neach; this was not a large amount, but he had been robbed the\r\npreceding year, as we have above related.\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone, Vasco made him a present of some glass beads,\r\nstrung in the form of necklaces and bracelets; also some mirrors,\r\ncopper bells, and similar European trifles. The natives cherish these\r\nthings highly, for whatever comes from abroad is everywhere most\r\nprized. Vasco pleased them still further by presenting them with some\r\niron hatchets for cutting down trees. There is no instrument the\r\nnatives appreciate so much, for they have no iron, nor any other\r\nmetals than gold; and they have great difficulty in cutting wood for\r\nthe construction of their houses or their canoes without iron. They do\r\nall their carpenter work with tools of sharp stone, which they find in\r\nthe rivers.\r\n\r\nThenceforth Poncha became his ally, and Vasco Nuñez, having no further\r\nfear of danger from behind, led his men towards the mountain. Poncha\r\nhad supplied him with guides and bearers who went on ahead and opened\r\nthe trail. They passed through inaccessible defiles inhabited by\r\nferocious beasts, and they climbed steep mountains.\r\n\r\nCommunication amongst the natives is infrequent, for naked men who\r\nhave no money have very few wants. Whatever trading they do is with\r\ntheir neighbours, and they exchange gold for ornaments or useful\r\narticles. It follows, therefore, as practically no communication\r\nexists, there are no roads. Their scouts are familiar with hidden\r\ntrails, which they use to make ambuscades or night forays or to\r\nmassacre and enslave their neighbours. Thanks to Poncha's men and the\r\nlabours of the bearers, Vasco scaled rugged mountains, crossed several\r\nlarge rivers, either by means of improvised bridges or by throwing\r\nbeams from one bank to another, and always succeeded in keeping his\r\nmen in health. Rather than become wearisome and incur the reproach of\r\nprolixity, I make no mention of some of the trials and fatigues they\r\nendured, but I judge that I should not omit to report what took place\r\nbetween them and the caciques whom they encountered on their march.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching the summit of the mountain-chain, the Spaniards\r\ntraversed the province of Quarequa, of which the ruler, who bears the\r\nsame name, came to meet them; as is customary in that country, he was\r\narmed with bows and arrows, and heavy, two-handed swords of wood.\r\nThey also carry sticks with burnt points, which they throw with great\r\nskill. Quarequa's reception was haughty and hostile, his disposition\r\nbeing to oppose the advance of such a numerous army. He asked where\r\nthe Spaniards were going and what they wanted, and in reply to the\r\ninterpreter's answer, he responded: \"Let them retrace their steps,\r\nif they do not wish to be killed to the last man.\" He stepped out in\r\nfront of his men, dressed, as were all his chiefs, while the rest of\r\nhis people were naked. He attacked the Spaniards who did not yield;\r\nnor was the battle prolonged, for their musket-fire convinced the\r\nnatives that they commanded the thunder and lightning. Unable to face\r\nthe arrows of our archers, they turned and fled, and the Spaniards cut\r\noff the arm of one, the leg or hip of another, and from some their\r\nheads at one stroke, like butchers cutting up beef and mutton for\r\nmarket. Six hundred, including the cacique, were thus slain like brute\r\nbeasts.\r\n\r\nVasco discovered that the village of Quarequa was stained by the\r\nfoulest vice. The king's brother and a number of other courtiers were\r\ndressed as women, and according to the accounts of the neighbours\r\nshared the same passion. Vasco ordered forty of them to be torn to\r\npieces by dogs. The Spaniards commonly used their dogs in fighting\r\nagainst these naked people, and the dogs threw themselves upon them as\r\nthough they were wild boars or timid deer. The Spaniards found these\r\nanimals as ready to share their dangers as did the people of Colophon\r\nor Castabara, who trained cohorts of dogs for war; for the dogs were\r\nalways in the lead and never shirked a fight.\r\n\r\nWhen the natives learned how severely Vasco had treated those\r\nshameless men, they pressed about him as though he were Hercules, and\r\nspitting upon those whom they suspected to be guilty of this vice,\r\nthey begged him to exterminate them, for the contagion was confined to\r\nthe courtiers and had not yet spread to the people. Raising their eyes\r\nand their hands to heaven, they gave it to be understood that God held\r\nthis sin in horror, punishing it by sending lightning and thunder, and\r\nfrequent inundations which destroyed the crops. It was like wise the\r\ncause of famine and sickness.\r\n\r\nThe natives worship no other god than the sun, who is the master and\r\nalone worthy of honour. Nevertheless, they accepted instruction and\r\nthey will rapidly adopt our religion when zealous teachers come to\r\ninstruct them. Their language contains nothing rough or difficult to\r\nunderstand, and all the words of their vocabulary may be translated\r\nand written in Latin letters, as we have already said was the case in\r\nHispaniola. They are a warlike race, and have always been troublesome\r\nneighbours. The country is neither rich in gold mines, nor does it\r\npossess a fertile soil, being mountainous and arid. Because of its\r\nprecipitous mountains the temperature is cold, and the chiefs wear\r\nclothes, but the bulk of the people are content to live in a state of\r\nnature. The Spaniards found negro slaves in this province.[4] They\r\nonly live in a region one day's march from Quarequa, and they are\r\nfierce and cruel. It is thought that negro pirates of Ethiopia\r\nestablished themselves after the wreck of their ships in these\r\nmountains. The natives of Quarequa carry on incessant war with these\r\nnegroes. Massacre or slavery is the alternate fortune of the two\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: This mysterious fact has been asserted by too many\r\nauthors to be refused credence. The author's explanation of the\r\nexistence of these Africans in America is possibly the correct one.]\r\n\r\nLeaving some of his companions who had fallen ill from the incessant\r\nfatigue and hardships to which they were not inured, at Quarequa,\r\nVasco, led by native guides, marched towards the summit of the\r\nmountain-chain.[5]\r\n\r\n[Note 5: On September 26, 1513; the men who accompanied him\r\nnumbered sixty-six.]\r\n\r\nFrom the village of Poncha to the spot where the southern ocean\r\nis visible is a six days' ordinary march, but he only covered the\r\ndistance in twenty-five days, after many adventures and great\r\nprivations. On the seventh day of the calends of October, a Quarequa\r\nguide showed him a peak from the summit of which the southern ocean is\r\nvisible. Vasco looked longingly at it. He commanded a halt, and went\r\nalone to scale the peak, being the first to reach its top. Kneeling\r\nupon the ground, he raised his hands to heaven and saluted the south\r\nsea; according to his account, he gave thanks to God and to all the\r\nsaints for having reserved this glory for him, an ordinary man, devoid\r\nalike of experience and authority. Concluding his prayers in military\r\nfashion, he waved his hand to some of his companions, and showed them\r\nthe object of their desires. Kneeling again, he prayed the Heavenly\r\nMediator, and especially the Virgin Mother of God, to favour his\r\nexpedition and to allow him to explore the region that stretched below\r\nhim. All his companions, shouting for joy, did likewise. Prouder than\r\nHannibal showing Italy and the Alps to his soldiers, Vasco Nuñez\r\npromised great riches to his men. \"Behold the much-desired ocean!\r\nBehold! all ye men, who have shared such efforts, behold the country\r\nof which the son of Comogre and other natives told us such wonders!\"\r\nAs a symbol of possession he built a heap of stones in the form of an\r\naltar, and that posterity might not accuse them of falsehood, they\r\ninscribed the name of the King of Castile here and there on the tree\r\ntrunks on both slopes of that summit, erecting several heaps of\r\nstones.[6]\r\n\r\n[Note 6: In conformity with Spanish usage, a notary, Andrés\r\nValderrabano, drew up a statement witnessing the discovery, which was\r\nsigned, first by Balboa, next by the priest, Andres de Vera, and by\r\nall the others, finishing with the notary himself.]\r\n\r\nFinally the Spaniards arrived at the residence of a cacique called\r\nChiapes. This chief, fully armed and accompanied by a multitude of his\r\npeople, advanced menacingly, determined not only to block their way\r\nbut to prevent them crossing his frontier. Although the Christians\r\nwere few they closed up their ranks and marched towards the enemy,\r\ndischarging their guns and unleashing a pack of hounds against\r\nChiapes. The sound of the cannon reverberated amongst the mountains,\r\nand the smoke from the powder seemed to dart forth flames; and when\r\nthe Indians smelt the sulphur which the wind blew towards them,\r\nthey fled in a panic, throwing themselves on the ground in terror,\r\nconvinced that lightning had struck them. While lying on the ground or\r\nwildly scattering, the Spaniards approached them with closed ranks and\r\nin good order. In the pursuit they killed some and took the greater\r\nnumber prisoners. It was their original intention to treat those\r\nIndians kindly and to explore their country in an amicable manner.\r\nVasco took possession of the house of Chiapes, and seized most of\r\nthose who had been captured while attempting to escape. He sent\r\nseveral of them to invite their cacique to return; they were told to\r\npromise him peace, friendship, and kind treatment, but if he did not\r\ncome, it would mean his ruin and the destruction of his people and\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIn order to convince Chiapes of his sincerity, Vasco Nuñez sent with\r\nhis messengers some of the natives of Quarequa, who were serving him\r\nas guides. These latter spoke to him in their own name and that of\r\ntheir cacique, and Chiapes, allowing himself to be persuaded by their\r\narguments and the entreaties of his own subjects, confided in the\r\npromise made to him. Leaving his hiding-place, he returned to the\r\nSpaniards, where a friendly agreement was made, hand-clasps and mutual\r\nvows exchanged, the alliance being confirmed by reciprocal presents.\r\nVasco received four hundred pesos of wrought gold from Chiapes. We\r\nhave remarked that a peso was equal to rather more than thirty ducats.\r\nThe cacique received a number of articles of European manufacture, and\r\nthe greatest mutual satisfaction prevailed. A halt of several days was\r\ndecided upon, to await the arrival of the Spaniards who had been left\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nDismissing the people of Quarequa with some gifts, the Spaniards,\r\nunder the guidance of the people of Chiapes and accompanied by the\r\ncacique himself, made the descent from the mountain-ridge to the\r\nshores of the much-desired ocean in four days. Great was their joy;\r\nand in the presence of the natives they took possession, in the name\r\nof the King of Castile, of all that sea and the countries bordering on\r\nit.\r\n\r\nVasco left some of his men with Chiapes, that he might be freer to\r\nexplore the country. He borrowed from the cacique nine of those\r\nbarques dug out of single tree trunks, which the natives call\r\n_culches_; and accompanied by eighty of his own men and guided by\r\nChiapes, he sailed on a large river which led him to the territory of\r\nanother cacique called Coquera. This chief, like the others, wished at\r\nfirst to resist and drive out the Spaniards. His attempt was vain,\r\nand he was conquered and put to flight. Acting upon the counsel of\r\nChiapes, Coquera returned, for the envoys sent by the latter spoke to\r\nhim thus: \"These strangers are invincible. If you treat them kindly,\r\nthey are amiable, but if you resist them, they turn hard and cruel.\r\nIf you become their friend, they promise assistance, protection, and\r\npeace, as you may see from our own case and that of the neighbouring\r\ncaciques; but if you refuse their friendship, then prepare for ruin\r\nand death.\"\r\n\r\nConvinced by these representations, Coquera gave the Spaniards six\r\nhundred and fifty pesos of wrought gold, receiving the usual presents\r\nin exchange. It was the same treatment that had been extended to\r\nPoncha.\r\n\r\nAfter concluding peace with Coquera, Vasco returned to the country of\r\nChiapes. He reviewed his soldiers, took some rest, and then resolved\r\nto visit a large gulf in the neighbourhood. According to the report\r\nof the natives, the length of this gulf, from the place where it\r\npenetrates into the country to its most distant shores, is sixty\r\nmiles. It is dotted with islands and reefs, and Vasco named it San\r\nMiguel. Taking the nine barques he had borrowed from Chiapes, in which\r\nhe had already crossed the river, he embarked with eighty of his\r\ncompanions, all at that time in good health. Chiapes did his best to\r\ndiscourage this enterprise, counselling Vasco on no account to risk\r\nhimself in the gulf at that period of the year, as during three months\r\nit is so tempestuous that navigation becomes impossible. He himself\r\nhad seen many culches swept away by the raging waves. Vasco Nuñez,\r\nunwilling to incur delay, affirmed that God and all the heavenly host\r\nfavoured his enterprise, and that he was labouring for God, and to\r\npropagate the Christian religion, and to discover treasures to\r\nserve as the sinews of war against the enemies of the Faith. After\r\npronouncing a brilliant discourse, he persuaded his companions to\r\nembark in the canoes of Chiapes. The latter, wishing to remove the\r\nlast doubt from the mind of Vasco Nuñez, declared he was ready to\r\naccompany him anywhere, and that he would act as his guide, for he\r\nwould not permit the Spaniards to leave his territory under other\r\nescort than his own.\r\n\r\nHardly had the Spaniards reached the open sea in their canoes than\r\nthey were overtaken by such a violent tempest that they knew not\r\nwhither to steer, nor where to find refuge. Trembling and frightened,\r\nthey looked at one another, while Chiapes and the Indians were even\r\nmore alarmed, for they knew the dangers of such navigation and had\r\noften witnessed wrecks. They survived the peril and, after fastening\r\ntheir canoes to rocks along the shore, they took refuge on a\r\nneighbouring island. But during the night, the tide rose and covered\r\nnearly the whole of it. At high tide the south sea rises to such an\r\nextent that many immense rocks which rise above low water are then\r\ncovered by the waves. In the north sea, however, according to the\r\nunanimous testimony of those who inhabit its banks, the tide recedes\r\nhardly a cubit from the shore. The inhabitants of Hispaniola and the\r\nneighbouring islands confirm this fact.\r\n\r\nWhen the coast was left dry, the Spaniards returned to their culches,\r\nbut were dumfounded to find all of them damaged and filled with sand.\r\nThough dug out of tree trunks some were broken and split open, the\r\ncables that had held them having been snapped. To repair them they\r\nused moss, bark, some very tough marine plants and grasses. Looking\r\nlike shipwrecked men and almost dead with hunger (for the storm had\r\nswept away almost all their stores), they set out to return. The\r\nnatives say that at all times of the year the incoming and the\r\noutgoing tides fill the islands of the gulf with a frightful roaring\r\nsound; but that this principally happens during the three months\r\nindicated by Chiapes, and which correspond to October, November, and\r\nDecember. It was just within the month of October and, according to\r\nthe cacique, it was under that and the two following moons that the\r\ntempest prevailed.\r\n\r\nAfter devoting some days to rest, Vasco Nuñez crossed the territory\r\nof another unimportant cacique and entered the country of a second,\r\ncalled Tumaco, whose authority extended along the gulf coast. Tumaco,\r\nfollowing the example of his colleagues, took up arms; but his\r\nresistance was equally vain. Conquered and put to flight, all of his\r\nsubjects who resisted were massacred. The others were spared, for the\r\nSpaniards preferred to have peaceful and amicable relations with those\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\nTumaco was wanted, and the envoys of Chiapes urged him to come back\r\nwithout fear, but neither promises nor threats moved him. Having\r\ninspired him with fears for his own life, extermination for his\r\nfamily, and ruin for his town, if he held out, the cacique decided to\r\nsend his son to the Spaniards. After presenting this young man with\r\na robe and other similar gifts, Vasco sent him back, begging him to\r\ninform his father of the resources and bravery of the strangers.\r\n\r\nTumaco was touched by the kindness shown to his son, and three days\r\nlater he appeared; he brought no present at first, but in obedience to\r\nhis orders, his attendants gave six hundred and fourteen pesos of gold\r\nand two hundred and forty selected pearls and a quantity of smaller\r\nones. These pearls excited the unending admiration of the Spaniards,\r\nthough they are not of the finest quality, because the natives cook\r\nthe shells before extracting them, in order to do so more easily, and\r\nthat the flesh of the oyster may be more palatable. This viand is very\r\nmuch esteemed and is reserved for the caciques, who prize it more\r\nthan they do the pearls themselves; at least this is the report of a\r\ncertain Biscayan, Arbolazzo, one of Vasco Nuñez's companions, who was\r\nafterwards sent to our sovereign with pearl oysters. One must believe\r\neye-witnesses.[7]\r\n\r\n[Note 7: Arbolazzo's mission was successful in completely\r\nappeasing King Ferdinand's vexation and obtaining from him Balboa's\r\nnomination as Adelantado, and other privileges and favours for the\r\nparticipators in the discoveries.]\r\n\r\nObserving that the Spaniards attached great value to pearls, Tumaco\r\nordered some of his men to prepare to dive for some. They obeyed, and\r\nfour days later came back bringing four pounds of pearls. This caused\r\nthe liveliest satisfaction, and everybody embraced with effusion.\r\nBalboa was delighted with the presents he had received, and Tumaco was\r\nsatisfied to have cemented the alliance. The mouths of the Spaniards\r\nfairly watered with satisfaction as they talked about this great\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nThe cacique Chiapes, who had accompanied them and was present during\r\nthese events, was also well satisfied, chiefly because it was under\r\nhis leadership the Spaniards had undertaken such a profitable\r\nenterprise, and also because he had been enabled to show his more\r\npowerful neighbour, who perhaps was not agreeable to him, what valiant\r\nfriends he possessed. He thought the Spanish alliance would be very\r\nuseful to him, for all these naked savages cherish an inveterate\r\nhatred of each other and are consumed with ambition.\r\n\r\nVasco Nuñez flattered himself that he had learned many secrets\r\nconcerning the wealth of the country from Tumaco, but declared that he\r\nwould, for the moment, keep them exclusively to himself, for they were\r\nthe cacique's gift to him. According to the report of the Spaniards,\r\nTumaco and Chiapes said there was an island much larger than the\r\nothers in the gulf, governed by a single cacique. Whenever the sea was\r\ncalm, this cacique attacked their territories with an imposing fleet\r\nof canoes, and carried off everything he found. This island is about\r\ntwenty miles distant from the shore, and from the hilltops of the\r\ncontinent its coasts were visible. It is said that shells as big as\r\nfans are found on its shores, from which pearls, sometimes the size of\r\na bean or an olive, are taken. Cleopatra would have been proud to own\r\nsuch. Although this island is near to the shore, it extends beyond the\r\nmouth of the gulf, out into the open sea. Vasco was glad to hear these\r\nparticulars, and perceived the profit he might derive. In order to\r\nattach the two caciques more closely to his interest and to convert\r\nthem into allies, he denounced the chieftain of the island, with\r\ndireful threats. He pledged himself to land there and to conquer,\r\nexterminate, and massacre the cacique. To give effect to his words,\r\nhe ordered the canoes to be prepared, but both Chiapes and Tumaco\r\namicably urged him to postpone this enterprise until the return of\r\nfair weather, as no canoe could ride the sea at that season of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThis was in November when storms and hurricanes prevail. The coasts\r\nof the island are inhospitable, and among the channels separating\r\ndifferent islands is heard the horrible roaring of the waves battling\r\nwith one another. The rivers overflow their beds, and, rushing down\r\nthe mountain slopes, tear up the rocks and huge trees, and pour into\r\nthe sea with unparallelled uproar. Raging winds from the south and\r\nsouthwest prevailing at that season, accompanied by perpetual thunder\r\nand lightning, sweep over and destroy the houses. Whenever the weather\r\nwas clear, the nights were cold, but during the day the heat was\r\ninsufferable. Nor is this astonishing, for this region is near the\r\nequator, and the pole star is no longer visible. In that country the\r\nicy temperature during the night is due to the moon and other planets,\r\nwhile the sun and its satellites cause the heat during the day.\r\nSuch were not the opinions of the ancients, who imagined that\r\nthe equinoctial circle was devoid of inhabitants because of the\r\nperpendicular rays of the sun. Some few authors, whose theories the\r\nPortuguese have shown by experience to be correct, dissented from this\r\nview. Each year the Portuguese arrive at the antartic antipodes, and\r\ncarry on commerce with those people. I say the antipodes; yet I am not\r\nignorant that there are learned men, most illustrious for their genius\r\nand their science, amongst whom there are some saints who deny the\r\nexistence of the antipodes. No one man can know everything. The\r\nPortuguese have gone beyond the fifty-fifth degree of the other Pole,\r\nwhere, in sailing about the point, they could see throughout the\r\nheavenly vault certain nebulae, similar to the Milky Way, in which\r\nrays of light shone. They say there is no notable fixed star near that\r\nPole, similar to the one in our hemisphere, vulgarly believed to be\r\nthe Pole, and which is called in Italy _tramontane_, in Spain the\r\nNorth Star. From the world's axis in the centre of the sign of the\r\nScales, the sun, when it sets for us rises for them, and when it is\r\nspringtime there, it is autumn with us, and summer there when we have\r\nwinter. But enough of this digression, and let us resume our subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\nInfluenced by the advice of the caciques Chiapes and Tumaco, Vasco\r\nNuñez decided to postpone his visit to the island until spring or\r\nsummer, at which time Chiapes offered to accompany him. Meanwhile he\r\nunderstood the caciques had nets near the coasts where they fished for\r\npearl oysters. The caciques have skilful divers trained from infancy\r\nto this profession, and who dive for these oysters as though in\r\nfish-ponds, but they only do so when the sea is calm and the water\r\nlow, which renders diving easier. The larger the shells the more\r\ndeeply are they embedded. The oysters of ordinary size, like daughters\r\nof the others, lie nearer the surface, while the little ones, like\r\ngrandchildren, are still nearer. It is necessary to dive three and\r\nsometimes even four times a man's height to find the more deeply\r\nembedded shells; but to get the daughters and grandchildren it is\r\nnot required to go deeper than the waist and sometimes even less. It\r\nsometimes happens, after heavy storms when the sea calms down, that\r\na multitude of these shells, torn by the waves from their beds, are\r\ndeposited on the shore, but this sort only contains very small pearls.\r\nThe meat of these bivalves, like that of our oysters, is good to eat,\r\nand it is even claimed their flavour is more delicate. I suspect that\r\nhunger, which is the best sauce for every dish, has induced this\r\nopinion among our compatriots.\r\n\r\nAre pearls, as Aristotle states, the heart of the shells, or are they\r\nrather, as Pliny says, the product of the intestines and really the\r\nexcrement of these animals? Do oysters pass their whole life attached\r\nto the same rock, or do they move through the sea in numbers, under\r\nthe leadership of older ones? Does one shell produce one or many\r\npearls? Is there but one growth, or is such growth ever repeated? Must\r\none have a rake to detach them, or are they gathered without trouble?\r\nAre pearls in a soft or hard state when they enter the shell? These\r\nare problems which we have not yet solved, but I hope that I may some\r\nday enlighten my doubts on this subject, for our compatriots possess\r\nmeans for studying these questions. As soon as I am informed of the\r\nlanding of the captain, Pedro Arias, I shall write and ask him to make\r\na serious inquiry concerning these points, and to send me the precise\r\nresults he obtains. I know he will do this, for he is my friend. Is it\r\nnot really absurd to keep silence about a subject interesting to men\r\nand women both in ancient times and in our own, and which inflames\r\neverybody with such immoderate desires? Spain may henceforth satisfy\r\nthe desires of a Cleopatra or an Æsop for pearls. No one will\r\nhenceforth rage against or envy the riches of Stoïdes[1] or Ceylon, of\r\nthe Indian Ocean or the Red Sea. But let us come back to our subject.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: Pliny mentions this island, off the coast of Macedonia,\r\nas having pearl fisheries.]\r\n\r\nVasco determined to have that part of the sea where Chiapes obtained\r\nhis pearls explored by swimmers. Although the weather was bad and a\r\nstorm threatened, the cacique, to please him, ordered thirty of his\r\ndivers to repair to the oyster beds. Vasco set six of his companions\r\nto watch the divers, but without leaving the shore or exposing\r\nthemselves to risk from the storm. The men set out together for\r\nthe shore, which was not more than ten miles from the residence of\r\nChiapes. Although the divers did not venture to the bottom of the\r\nocean, because of the danger from the storm, nevertheless they\r\nsucceeded in gathering, in a few days, six loads of pearls,[2]\r\nincluding the shells gathered near the surface or strewn by the\r\nviolence of the storm on the sands. They fed greedily on the flesh of\r\nthese animals. The pearls found were not larger than a lentil or a\r\nlittle pea, but they had a beautiful orient, for they had been\r\ntaken out while the animal was still alive. Not to be accused of\r\nexaggeration concerning the size of these shells, the Spaniards sent\r\nthe King some remarkable specimens, from which the meat had been\r\nremoved, at the same time as the pearls. It does not seem possible\r\nthat shells of such size should be found anywhere. These shells and\r\nthe gold which has been found pretty much everywhere are proof that\r\nNature conceals vast treasures in this country, though thus far the\r\nexploration covered, so to speak, the little finger of a pigmy, since\r\nall that is known is the neighbourhood of Uraba. What it will be when\r\nthe whole hand of the giant is known and the Spaniards shall have\r\npenetrated into all the profound and mysterious parts of the\r\ncontinent, no man can say.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: _Sex attulerunt sarcinas brevi dierum numero_. The word\r\n_sarcinas_ as an expression of measure is vague.]\r\n\r\nHappy and satisfied with these discoveries, Vasco decided to return by\r\nanother route to his companions at Darien, who were gold-mining about\r\nten miles from their village. He dismissed Chiapes, charging him to\r\ncome no farther and to take good care of himself. They embraced one\r\nanother, and it was with difficulty that the cacique restrained his\r\ntears while they shook hands at parting. Vasco left his sick there\r\nand, guided by the sailors of Chiapes, he set out with his able-bodied\r\nmen. The little company crossed a great river which was not fordable,\r\nand entered the territory of a chief called Taocha who was very\r\npleased upon learning of their arrival, for he already knew the\r\ncustoms of the Spaniards. He came out to meet them, receiving them\r\nwith honour, and making salutations as a proof of his affection. He\r\npresented Vasco with twenty pounds (at eight ounces to the pound) of\r\nartistically worked gold, and two hundred selected pearls; the latter\r\nwere not, however, very brilliant. They shook hands and Taocha,\r\naccepting the gifts offered him, begged that the people of Chiapes\r\nshould be dismissed, as he himself wished to have the pleasure of\r\nescorting his guests.\r\n\r\nWhen the Spaniards left his village he not only furnished them guides,\r\nbut also slaves who were prisoners of war and who took the place of\r\nbeasts of burden in carrying on their shoulders provisions for the\r\nmarch. They had to pass through lonely forests and over steep and\r\nrocky mountains, where ferocious lions and tigers abounded. Taocha\r\nplaced his favourite son in command of the slaves, whom he loaded with\r\nsalt fish and bread made of yucca and maize; he commanded his son\r\nnever to leave the Spaniards and not to come back without permission\r\nfrom Vasco. Led by this young man, they entered the territory of a\r\nchief called Pacra, who was an atrocious tyrant. Whether frightened\r\nbecause conscious of his crimes, or whether he felt himself powerless,\r\nPacra fled.\r\n\r\nDuring this month of November the Spaniards suffered greatly from the\r\nheat and from the torments of thirst, for very little water is found\r\nin that mountainous region. They would all have perished, had not two\r\nof them who went to search for water, carrying the pumpkins Taocha's\r\npeople brought with them, found a little spring which the natives had\r\npointed out, hidden in a remote corner of the forest. None of the\r\nlatter had ventured to stray from the main body, for they were afraid\r\nof being attacked by wild beasts. They recounted that on these heights\r\nand in the neighbourhood of this spring, ferocious beasts had carried\r\noff people in the night, and even from their cabins. They were,\r\ntherefore, careful to put bolts and all kinds of bars on their doors.\r\nIt may perhaps not be out of place, before going farther, to relate a\r\nparticular instance. It is said that last year a tiger ravaged Darien,\r\ndoing as much damage as did formerly the raging boar of Calydon or\r\nthe fierce Nemæan lion. During six entire months, not a night passed\r\nwithout a victim, whether a mare, a colt, a dog, or a pig being taken,\r\neven in the street of the town. The flocks and the animals might\r\nbe sacrificed but it was not safe for people to quit their houses,\r\nespecially when it sought food for its whelps; for when they were\r\nhungry the monster attacked people it found rather than animals.\r\nAnxiety led to the invention of a means of avenging so much bloodshed.\r\nThe path it took when leaving its lair at night in search of prey, was\r\ncarefully studied. The natives cut the road, digging a ditch which\r\nthey covered over with boughs and earth. The tiger, which was a male,\r\nwas incautious, and, falling into the ditch, remained there, stuck\r\non the sharp points fixed in the bottom. Its roarings filled the\r\nneighbourhood and the mountains echoed with piercing howls. They\r\nkilled the monster stuck on the points, by throwing great stones from\r\nthe banks of the ditch. With one blow of its paw it broke the javelins\r\nthrown at it into a thousand fragments, and even when dead and no\r\nlonger breathing, it filled all who beheld him with terror. What would\r\nhave happened had it been free and unhurt! A civilian called Juan de\r\nLedesma, a friend of Vasco, and his companion in danger, says that he\r\nate the flesh of that tiger; he told me that it was not inferior to\r\nbeef. When one asks these people who have never seen tigers why they\r\naffirm that this beast was a tiger, they reply that it was because it\r\nwas spotted, ferocious, sly, and offered other characteristics which\r\nothers have attributed to tigers. Nevertheless the majority of\r\nSpaniards affirm that they have seen spotted leopards and panthers.\r\n\r\nAfter the male tiger was killed, they followed its track through the\r\nmountains, and discovered the cave where it lived with its family. The\r\nfemale was absent; but two little ones, still unweaned, were lying\r\nthere, and these the Spaniards carried away; but changing their minds\r\nafterwards and wishing to carry them to Spain when they were a little\r\nlarger, they put carefully riveted chains round their necks and took\r\nthem back to the cave, in order that their mother might nurse them.\r\nSome days later they went back and found the chains still there, but\r\nthe cave was empty. It is thought the mother, in a fury, tore the\r\nlittle ones to pieces, and took them away, in order that nobody should\r\nhave them; for they could not possibly have got loose from their\r\nchains alive. The dead tiger's skin was stuffed with dried herbs and\r\nstraw, and sent to Hispaniola to be presented to the Admiral and other\r\nofficials, from whom the colonists of those two new countries obtain\r\nlaws and assistance.\r\n\r\nThis story was told me by those who had suffered from the ravages of\r\nthat tiger,[3] and had touched its skin; let us accept what they give\r\nus.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: As has been observed, there were no tigers in America.\r\nThe animal described may have been a jaguar.]\r\n\r\nLet us now return to Pacra, from whom we have somewhat wandered. After\r\nhaving entered the boios (that is to say, the house) abandoned by the\r\ncacique, Vasco sought to induce him to return by means of envoys who\r\nmade known the conditions already proposed to other caciques; but for\r\na long time Pacra refused. Vasco then tried threats, and the cacique\r\nfinally decided to come in, accompanied by three others. Vasco writes\r\nthat he was deformed, and so dirty and hideous that nothing more\r\nabominable could be imagined. Nature confined herself to giving him a\r\nhuman form, but he is a brute beast, savage and monstrous. His morals\r\nwere on a par with his bearing and physiognomy. He had carried off\r\nthe daughters of four neighbouring caciques to satisfy his brutal\r\npassions. The neighbouring chiefs, regarding Vasco as a supreme judge\r\nor a Hercules, a redresser of injuries, complained of the debaucheries\r\nand the crimes of Pacra, begging that he should be punished by death.\r\nVasco had this filthy beast and the other three caciques, who obeyed\r\nhim and shared his passions, torn to pieces by dogs of war, and the\r\nfragments of their bodies were afterwards burnt. Astonishing things\r\nare said about these dogs the Spaniards take into battle. These\r\nanimals throw themselves with fury on the armed natives pointed out to\r\nthem, as if they were timid deer or fierce boars; and it often happens\r\nthat there is no need of swords or javelins to rout the enemy. A\r\ncommand is given to these dogs who form the vanguard, and the\r\nnatives at the mere sight of these formidable Molossians[4] and the\r\nunaccustomed sound of their baying, break their ranks and flee as\r\nthough horrified and stupefied by some unheard-of prodigy. This does\r\nnot occur in fighting against the natives of Caramaira or the Caribs,\r\nwho are braver and understand more about war. They shoot their\r\npoisoned arrows with the rapidity of lightning, and kill the dogs in\r\ngreat numbers; but the natives of these mountains do not use arrows\r\nin warfare; they only use machanes,[5] that is to say, large wooden\r\nswords, and lances with burnt points.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: _Torvo molossorum adspectu_. Referring to the dogs of\r\nEpirus, called by the Romans, Molossi.]\r\n\r\n[Note 5: The _maquahuitle of the Mexicans; a flat wooden club, in\r\nwhich blades of _iztli_, or flint, were set on the opposite edges; it\r\nwas their most formidable weapon in hand-to-hand encounters.]\r\n\r\nWhile Pacra was still alive they asked him where his people obtained\r\ngold, but neither by persuasion nor threats nor tortures could they\r\ndrag this secret from him. When asked how he had procured what he had\r\npossessed,--for he had offered a present of thirty pounds of gold out\r\nof his treasury--he answered that those of his subjects who, either\r\nin the time of his parents or in his own, had mined that gold in the\r\nmountain were dead, and that since his youth he had not troubled\r\nto look for gold. Nothing more could be obtained from him on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe rigorous treatment of Pacra secured Vasco the friendship of the\r\nneighbouring caciques, and when he sent for the sick, whom he had left\r\nbehind to join him, a cacique, called Bononiama, whose country the\r\nroute directly traversed, received them kindly and gave them twenty\r\npounds of wrought gold and an abundance of provisions. Nor would he\r\nleave them until he had accompanied them from his residence to that of\r\nPacra, as though they had been confided to his fidelity. He spoke thus\r\nto Vasco: \"Here are your companions in arms, Most Illustrious Warrior;\r\njust as they came to me, so do I bring them to you. It would have\r\npleased me had they been in better health, but you and your companions\r\nare the servants of him who strikes the guilty with thunder and\r\nlightning, and who of his bounty, thanks to the kindly climate, gives\r\nus yucca and maize.\" While speaking these words he raised his eyes to\r\nHeaven and gave it to be understood that he referred to the sun. \"In\r\ndestroying our proud and violent enemies you have given peace to us\r\nand to all our people. You overcome monsters. We believe that you and\r\nyour equally brave companions have been sent from Heaven, and under\r\nthe protection of your machanes we may henceforth live without fear.\r\nOur gratitude to him who brings us these blessings and happiness\r\nshall be eternal.\" Such, or something like this, was the speech of\r\nBononiama, as translated by the interpreters. Vasco thanked him for\r\nhaving escorted our men and received them kindly, and sent him away\r\nloaded with precious gifts.\r\n\r\nVasco writes that the cacique Bononiama has disclosed to him many\r\nsecrets concerning the wealth of the region, which he reserves for\r\nlater, as he does not wish to speak of them in his letter. What he\r\nmeans by such exaggeration and reticence I do not understand. He seems\r\nto promise a great deal, and I think his promises warrant hope of\r\ngreat riches; moreover, the Spaniards have never entered a native\r\nhouse without finding either cuirasses and breast ornaments of gold,\r\nor necklaces and bracelets of the same metal. If anyone wishing to\r\ncollect iron should march with a troop of determined men through Italy\r\nor Spain, what iron articles would they find in the houses? In one a\r\ncooking stove, in another a boiler, elsewhere a tripod standing\r\nbefore the fire, and spits for cooking. He would everywhere find iron\r\nutensils, and could procure a large quantity of the metal. From which\r\nhe would conclude that iron abounded in the country. Now the natives\r\nof the New World set no more value on gold than we do on iron ore. All\r\nthese particulars, Most Holy Father, have been furnished me either by\r\nthe letters of Vasco Nuñez and his companions in arms, or by verbal\r\nreport. Their search for gold mines has produced no serious result,\r\nfor out of ninety men he took with him to Darien, he has never had\r\nmore than seventy or at most eighty under his immediate orders; the\r\nothers having been left behind in the dwellings of the caciques.\r\n\r\nThose who succumbed most easily to sickness were the men just arrived\r\nfrom Hispaniola; they could not put up with such hardships, nor\r\ncontent their stomachs, accustomed to better food, with the native\r\nbread, wild herbs without salt, and river water that was not always\r\neven wholesome. The veterans of Darien were more inured to all these\r\nills, and better able to resist extreme hunger. Thus Vasco gaily\r\nboasts that he has kept a longer and more rigorous Lent than Your\r\nHoliness, following the decrees of your predecessors, for it has\r\nlasted uninterruptedly for four years; during which time he and his\r\nmen have lived upon the products of the earth, the fruits of trees,\r\nand even of them there was not always enough. Rarely did they eat fish\r\nand still more rarely meat, and their wretchedness reached such a\r\npoint that they were obliged to eat sick dogs, nauseous toads, and\r\nother similar food, esteeming themselves fortunate when they found\r\neven such. I have already described all these miseries. I call\r\n\"veterans of Darien\" the first comers who established themselves in\r\nthis country under the leadership of Nicuesa and Hojeda, of whom there\r\nremains but a small number. But let this now suffice, and let us bring\r\nback Vasco and the veterans from their expedition across the great\r\nmountain-chain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the thirty days he stopped in Pacra's village, Vasco strove to\r\nconciliate the natives and to provide for the wants of his companions.\r\nFrom there, guided by subjects of Taocha, he marched along the banks\r\nof the Comogra River, which gives its name both to the country and to\r\nthe cacique. The mountains thereabouts are so steep and rocky, that\r\nnothing suitable for human food grows, save a few wild plants and\r\nroots and fruits of trees, fit to nourish animals. Two friendly and\r\nallied caciques inhabit this unfortunate region. Vasco hastened to\r\nleave behind a country so little favoured by man and by Nature, and,\r\npressed by hunger, he first dismissed the people of Taocha, and\r\ntook as guides the two impoverished caciques, one of whom was named\r\nCotochus and the other Ciuriza. He marched three days among wild\r\nforests, over unsealed mountains and through swamps, where muddy\r\npitfalls gave way beneath the feet and swallowed the incautious\r\ntraveller. He passed by places which beneficent Nature might\r\nhave created for man's wants, but there were no roads made; for\r\ncommunication amongst natives is rare, their only object being\r\nto murder or to enslave one another in their warlike incursions.\r\nOtherwise each tribe keeps within its own boundaries. Upon arriving at\r\nthe territory of a chief called Buchebuea, they found the place empty\r\nand silent, as the chief and all his people had fled into the woods.\r\nVasco sent messengers to call him back, notifying them not to use\r\nthreats, but, on the contrary, to promise protection. Buchebuea\r\nreplied that he had not fled because he feared harsh treatment, but\r\nrather because he was ashamed and sorry he could not receive our\r\ncompatriots with the honour they deserved, and was unable even to\r\nfurnish them provisions. As a token of submission and friendship he\r\nwillingly sent several golden vases, and asked pardon. It was thought\r\nthis unfortunate cacique wished it to be understood that he had\r\nbeen robbed and cruelly treated by some neighbouring enemy, so the\r\nSpaniards left his territory, with mouths gaping from hunger, and\r\nthinner than when they entered it.\r\n\r\nDuring the march, some naked people appeared on the flank of the\r\ncolumn. They made signs from a hilltop and Vasco ordered a halt to\r\nwait for them. Interpreters who accompanied the Spaniards asked them\r\nwhat they wanted, to which they replied \"Our cacique, Chiorisos,\r\nsalutes you. He knows you are brave men who redress wrongs and punish\r\nthe wicked, and though he only knows you by reputation he respects and\r\nhonours you. Nothing would have pleased him better than to have you as\r\nhis guests at his residence. He would have been proud to receive such\r\nguests, but since he has not yet had this good fortune and you have\r\npassed him by, he sends you as a pledge of affection these small\r\npieces of gold.\" With courteous smiles they presented to Vasco thirty\r\n_patenas_ of pure gold, saying they would give him still more if he\r\nwould come to visit them. The Spaniards give the name _patena_ to\r\nthose balls of metal worn on the neck, and also to the sacred utensil\r\nwith which the chalice is covered when carried to the altar. Whether\r\nin this instance plates for the table or balls are meant, I am\r\nabsolutely ignorant; I suppose, however, that they are plates, since\r\nthey weighed fourteen pounds, at eight ounces to the pound.\r\n\r\nThese natives then explained that there was in the neighbourhood a\r\nvery rich cacique, who was their enemy, and who yearly attacked them.\r\nIf the Spaniards would make war upon him, his downfall would enrich\r\nthem and would deliver friendly natives from incessant anxiety.\r\nNothing would be easier, they said through their interpreters, than\r\nfor you to help us, and we will act as your guides. Vasco encouraged\r\ntheir hopes and sent them away satisfied. In exchange for their\r\npresents he gave them some iron hatchets, which they prize more\r\nthan heaps of gold. For as they have no money--that source of all\r\nevils--they do not need gold. The owner of one single hatchet feels\r\nhimself richer than Crassus.[1] These natives believe that hatchets\r\nmay serve a thousand purposes of daily life, while gold is only sought\r\nto satisfy vain desires, without which one would be better off.\r\nNeither do they know our refinements of taste, which demand that\r\nsideboards shall be loaded with a variety of gold and silver vases.\r\nThese natives have neither tables, tablecloths, or napkins; the\r\ncaciques may sometimes decorate their tables with little golden vases,\r\nbut their subjects use the right hand to eat a piece of maize bread\r\nand the left to eat a piece of grilled fish or fruit, and thus satisfy\r\ntheir hunger. Very rarely they eat sugar-cane. If they have to wipe\r\ntheir hands after eating a certain dish, they use, instead of napkins,\r\nthe soles of their feet, or their hips, or sometimes their testicles.\r\nThe same fashion prevails in Hispaniola. It is true that they often\r\ndive into the rivers, and thus wash the whole of their bodies.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: Possibly a mis-copy of Croesus.]\r\n\r\nLoaded with gold, but suffering intensely and so hungry they were\r\nscarcely able to travel, the Spaniards continued their march and\r\nreached the territory of a chief called Pochorroso, where during\r\nthirty days they stuffed themselves with maize bread, which is similar\r\nto Milanese bread. Pochorroso had fled, but, attracted by coaxing and\r\npresents, he returned, and gifts were exchanged. Vasco gave Pochorroso\r\nthe usual acceptable articles, and the cacique gave Vasco fifteen\r\npounds of melted gold and some slaves. When they were about to depart,\r\nit transpired that it would be necessary to cross the territory of\r\na chief called Tumanama, the same formerly described by the son of\r\nComogre as the most powerful and formidable of those chiefs. Most of\r\nComogre's servants had been this man's slaves captured in war. As is\r\nthe case everywhere, these people gauged the power of Tumanama by\r\ntheir own standard, ignorant of the fact that these caciques, if\r\nbrought face to face with our soldiers commanded by a brave and\r\nfortunate leader, were no more to be feared than gnats attacking\r\nan elephant. When the Spaniards came to know Tumanama they quickly\r\ndiscovered that he did not rule on both sides of the mountain, nor was\r\nhe as rich in gold as the young Comogre pretended. Nevertheless they\r\ntook the trouble to conquer him. Pochorroso, being the enemy of\r\nTumanama, readily offered Vasco his advice.\r\n\r\nLeaving his sick in charge of the cacique, and summoning sixty\r\ncompanions, all strong and brave men, Vasco explained his purpose to\r\nthem, saying: \"The cacique Tumanama has often boasted that he was\r\nthe enemy of Vasco and his companions. We are obliged to cross his\r\ncountry, and it is my opinion we should attack him while he is not on\r\nhis guard.\" Vasco's companions approved this plan, urging him to put\r\nit into execution and offering to follow him. They decided to make\r\ntwo marches without stopping, so as to prevent Tumanama from calling\r\ntogether his warriors; and this plan was carried out as soon as\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\nIt was the first watch of the night when the Spaniards and the\r\nwarriors of Pochorroso invaded Tumanama's town, taking him completely\r\nby surprise, for he expected nothing. There were with him two men, his\r\nfavourites, and eighty women, who had been carried off from different\r\ncaciques by violence and outrage. His subjects and allied caciques\r\nwere scattered in villages of the neighbourhood, for they dwell in\r\nhouses widely separated from one another, instead of near together.\r\nThis custom is due to the frequent whirlwinds to which they are\r\nexposed by reason of sudden changes of temperature and the influence\r\nof the stars which conflict when the days and nights are equal in\r\nduration. We have already said that these people live near the\r\nequator. Their houses are built of wood, roofed and surrounded with\r\nstraw, or stalks of maize or the tough grass indigenous to the\r\ncountry. There was another house in Tumanama's village, and both were\r\ntwo hundred and twenty paces long and fifty broad. These houses were\r\nconstructed to shelter the soldiers when Tumanama made war.\r\n\r\nThe cacique was taken prisoner and with him his entire Sardanapalian\r\ncourt. As soon as he was found, the men of Pochorroso and the\r\nneighbouring caciques overwhelmed him with insults, for Tumanama was\r\nno less detested by the neighbouring caciques than that Pacra whom we\r\nhave mentioned in describing the expedition to the south sea. Vasco\r\nconcealed his real intentions towards the prisoner, but though he\r\nadopted a menacing attitude, he really intended him no harm. \"You\r\nshall pay the penalty of your crimes, tyrant,\" said he; \"you have\r\noften boasted before your people that if the Christians came here you\r\nwould seize them by the hair and drown them in the neighbouring river.\r\nBut it is you, miserable creature, that shall be thrown into the river\r\nand drowned.\" At the same time he ordered the prisoner to be seized,\r\nbut he had given his men to understand that he pardoned the cacique.\r\n\r\nTumanama threw himself at the feet of Vasco and begged pardon. He\r\nswore that he had said nothing of the kind, and that if anybody had,\r\nit must have been his caciques when they were drunk; for none of these\r\nchiefs understand moderation, and he accused them of using insolent\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nTheir wines are not made from grapes, as I have already told Your\r\nHoliness, when I began to cultivate this little field, but they are\r\nintoxicating. Tumanama complained, weeping, that his neighbours had\r\ninvented these falsehoods to destroy him, for they were jealous of him\r\nbecause he was more powerful than they. He promised in return for\r\nhis pardon a large quantity of gold, and clasping his hands upon his\r\nbreast, he said that he always both loved and feared the Spaniards,\r\nbecause he had learned their machanes--that is to say, their\r\nswords--were sharper than his and cut deeper wherever they struck.\r\nLooking Vasco straight in the eyes, he said: \"Who then, other than a\r\nfool, would venture to raise his hand against the sword of a man like\r\nyou, who can split a man open from head to navel at one stroke, and\r\ndoes not hesitate to do it? Let not yourself be persuaded, O bravest\r\nof living men, that such speech against you has ever proceeded from my\r\nmouth.\" These and many other words did he speak, feeling already the\r\nrope of death around his neck. Vasco, affecting to be touched by these\r\nprayers and tears, answered with calmness that he pardoned him and\r\ngave him his liberty. Thirty pounds (at eight ounces to the pound) of\r\npure gold in the form of women's necklaces were at once brought from\r\nthe two houses, and three days later the caciques subject to Tumanama\r\nsent sixty pounds more of gold, which was the amount of the fine\r\nimposed for their temerity. When asked whence he procured this gold,\r\nTumanama replied that it came from very distant mines. He gave it\r\nto be understood that it had been presented to his ancestors on the\r\nComogra River which flows into the south sea; but the people of\r\nPochorroso and his enemies said that he lied, and that his own\r\nterritory produced plenty of gold. Tumanama persisted, however, that\r\nhe knew of no gold mines in his domain. He added that it was true\r\nenough that here and there some small grains of gold had been found,\r\nbut nobody had even troubled to pick them up, since to do so would\r\nrequire tedious labour.\r\n\r\nDuring this discussion Vasco was joined on the eighth day of the\r\ncalends of January and the last day of the year 1513, by the men he\r\nhad left behind with Pochorroso. The slaves whom the southern caciques\r\nhad lent them, carried their gold-mining tools.\r\n\r\nThe day of the Nativity of Our Lord was given to rest, but the\r\nfollowing day, the Feast of the Protomartyr St. Stephen, Vasco led\r\nsome miners to a hill near Tumanama's residence because he thought\r\nfrom the colour of the earth that it contained gold. A hole a palm and\r\na half in size was made, and from the earth sifted a few grains of\r\ngold, not larger than a lentil, were obtained.\r\n\r\nVasco had this fact recorded by a notary and witnesses, in order to\r\nestablish the authenticity of this discovery, as he called it, of a\r\n_toman_ of gold. In the language of bankers, a _toman_ contains twelve\r\ngrains. Vasco consequently deduced, as the neighbouring caciques\r\nalleged, that the country was rich, but he could never prevail upon\r\nTumanama to admit it. Some said that Tumanama was indifferent to such\r\nunimportant fragments of gold, others claimed that he persisted in\r\ndenying the wealth of his country for fear the Spaniards, to satisfy\r\ntheir desire for gold, might take possession of the whole of it. The\r\ncacique saw only too well into the future; for the Spaniards have\r\ndecided, if the King consents, to establish new towns in his country\r\nand that of Pochorroso; these towns will serve as refuges and\r\nstorehouses for travellers going to the South Sea, and moreover both\r\ncountries are favourable for growing all kinds of fruits and crops.\r\n\r\nVasco decided to leave this country, and to blaze for himself, a new\r\ntrail through a land of which the earth tints and the shells seemed\r\nto him to indicate the presence of gold. He ordered a little digging\r\nbelow the surface of the earth to be done, and found a peso, weighing\r\na little more than a grain. I have already said in my First Decade,\r\naddressed to Your Holiness, that a peso was worth a castellano of\r\ngold. Enchanted with this result, he overwhelmed Tumanama with\r\nnattering promises to prevent the cacique from interfering with any of\r\nthe Spaniards' allies in that neighbourhood. He also besought him to\r\ncollect a quantity of gold. It is alleged that he had carried off all\r\nthe cacique's women, and had practically stripped him to check his\r\ninsolence. Tumanama also confided his son to Vasco in order that the\r\nboy might learn our language in living with the Spaniards, and become\r\nacquainted with our habits and be converted to our religion. It may\r\nbe that the boy's education may some day be of use to his father, and\r\nsecure him our favour.\r\n\r\nThe immense fatigues, the long watches, and the privations Vasco had\r\nendured ended by provoking a violent fever, so that on leaving this\r\ncountry he had to be carried on the shoulders of slaves. All the\r\nothers who were seriously ill, were likewise carried in hammocks,\r\nthat is to say, in cotton nets. Others, who still had some strength,\r\ndespite their weak legs, were supported under the armpits and carried\r\nby the natives. They finally arrived in the country of our friend\r\nComogre, of whom I have lengthily spoken above. The old man was dead\r\nand had been succeeded by that son whose wisdom we have praised. This\r\nyoung man had been baptised, and was called Carlos. The palace of this\r\nComogre stands at the foot of a cultivated hill, rising in a fertile\r\nplain that tends for a breadth of twelve leagues towards the south.\r\nThis plain is called by the natives _savana_. Beyond the limits of the\r\nplain rise the very lofty mountains that serve as a divide between the\r\ntwo oceans. Upon their slopes rises the Comogre River which, after\r\nwatering this plain, runs through a mountainous country, gathering to\r\nitself tributaries from all the valleys and finally emptying into the\r\nSouth Sea. It is distant about seventy leagues to the west of Darien.\r\n\r\nUttering cries of joy, Carlos hastened to meet the Spaniards,\r\nrefreshing them with food and agreeable drinks, and lavishing generous\r\nhospitality upon them. Presents were exchanged, the cacique giving\r\nVasco twenty pounds of worked gold, at eight ounces to the pound,\r\nand Vasco satisfying him with equally acceptable presents, such as\r\nhatchets, and some carpenters' tools. He likewise gave Carlos a robe\r\nand one of his own shirts, because of the extremity to which he was\r\nreduced. These gifts elevated Carlos to the rank of a hero among\r\nhis neighbours. Vasco finally left Comogra and all its people after\r\nadmonishing them that, if they wished to live in peace, they must\r\nnever rebel against the rule of the Spanish King. He also urged them\r\nto use their best endeavours to collect gold for the _Tiba_, that is\r\nto say, the King. He added that in this way they would secure for\r\nthemselves and their descendants protection against the attacks of\r\ntheir enemies, and would receive an abundance of our merchandise.\r\n\r\nWhen everything had been satisfactorily arranged, Vasco continued his\r\nmarch towards the country of Poncha, where he met four young men sent\r\nfrom Darien to inform him that well-laden ships had just arrived from\r\nHispaniola; he had promised that, in returning from the South Sea, he\r\nwould march by some way through that country. Taking with him twenty\r\nof his strongest companions he started by forced marches for Darien,\r\nleaving behind the others who were to join him. Vasco has written that\r\nhe reached Darien the fourteenth day of the calends of February in the\r\nyear 1514, but his letter[2] is dated Darien, the fourth day of the\r\nnones of March, as he was unable to send it sooner no ship being ready\r\nto sail. He says that he has sent two ships to pick up the people he\r\nleft behind, and he boasts of having won a number of battles without\r\nreceiving a wound or losing one of his men in action.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Unfortunately neither this letter or any copy of it is\r\nknown to exist.]\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a page of this long letter which is not inscribed with\r\nsome act of thanksgiving for the great dangers and many hardships he\r\nescaped. He never undertook anything or started on his march without\r\nfirst invoking the heavenly powers, and principally the Virgin Mother\r\nof God. Our Vasco Balboa is seen to have changed from a ferocious\r\nGoliath into an Elias. He was an Antæus; he has been transformed into\r\nHercules the conqueror of monsters. From being foolhardy, he has\r\nbecome obedient and entirely worthy of royal honours and favour. Such\r\nare the events made known to us by letters from him and the colonists\r\nof Darien, and by verbal reports of people who have returned from\r\nthose regions.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you may desire, Most Holy Father, to know what my sentiments\r\nare respecting these events. My opinion is a simple one. It is evident\r\nfrom the military style in which Vasco and his men report their deeds\r\nthat their statements must be true. Spain need no longer plough up the\r\nground to the depth of the infernal regions or open great roads or\r\npierce mountains at the cost of labour and the risk of a thousand\r\ndangers, in order to draw wealth from the earth. She will find riches\r\non the surface, in shallow diggings; she will find them in the\r\nsun-dried banks of rivers; it will suffice to merely sift the earth.\r\nPearls will be gathered with little effort. Cosmographers unanimously\r\nrecognise that venerable antiquity received no such benefit from\r\nnature, because never before did man, starting from the known world,\r\npenetrate to those unknown regions. It is true the natives are\r\ncontented with a little or nothing, and are not hospitable; moreover,\r\nwe have more than sufficiently demonstrated that they receive\r\nungraciously strangers who come amongst them, and only consent to\r\nnegotiate with them, after they have been conquered. Most ferocious\r\nare those new anthropophagi, who live on human flesh, Caribs or\r\ncannibals as they are called. These cunning man-hunters think of\r\nnothing else than this occupation, and all the time not given to\r\ncultivating the fields they employ in wars and man-hunts. Licking\r\ntheir lips in anticipation of their desired prey, these men lie in\r\nwait for our compatriots, as the latter would for wild boar or deer\r\nthey sought to trap. If they feel themselves unequal to a battle, they\r\nretreat and disappear with the speed of the wind. If an encounter\r\ntakes place on the water, men and women swim with as great a facility\r\nas though they lived in that element and found their sustenance under\r\nthe waves.\r\n\r\nIt is not therefore astonishing that these immense tracts of country\r\nshould be abandoned and unknown, but the Christian religion, of which\r\nyou are the head, will embrace its vast extent. As I have said in\r\nthe beginning, Your Holiness will call to yourself these myriads of\r\npeople, as the hen gathers her chickens under her wings. Let us now\r\nreturn to Veragua, the place discovered by Columbus, explored under\r\nthe auspices of Diego Nicuesa, and now abandoned; and may all the\r\nother barbarous and savage provinces of this vast continent be brought\r\nlittle by little into the pale of Christian civilisation and the\r\nknowledge of the true religion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\n\r\nI had resolved, Most Holy Father, to stop here but I am consumed, as\r\nit were, with an internal fire which constrains me to continue my\r\nreport. As I have already said, Veragua was discovered by Columbus.\r\nI should feel that I had robbed him or committed an inexpiable crime\r\nagainst him were I to pass over the ills he endured, the vexations and\r\ndangers to which he was exposed during these voyages. It was in the\r\nyear of salvation 1502 on the sixth day of the ides of May that\r\nColumbus sailed from Cadiz with a squadron of four vessels of from\r\nfifty to sixty tons burthen, manned by one hundred and seventy men.[1]\r\nFive days of favourable weather brought him to the Canaries; seventeen\r\ndays' sailing brought him to the island of Domingo, the home of the\r\nCaribs, and from thence he reached Hispaniola in five days more, so\r\nthat the entire crossing from Spain to Hispaniola occupied twenty-six\r\ndays, thanks to favourable winds and currents, which set from the east\r\ntowards the west. According to the mariners' report the distance is\r\ntwelve hundred leagues.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: This was the fourth voyage of Columbus.]\r\n\r\nHe stopped in Hispaniola for some time, either of his own accord or\r\nwith the Viceroy's[2] assent. Pushing straight to the west, he left\r\nthe islands of Cuba and Jamaica towards his right on the north, and\r\ndiscovered to the south of Jamaica an island called by its inhabitants\r\nGuanassa.[3] This island is incredibly fertile and luxuriant. While\r\ncoasting along its shores, the Admiral met two of those barques dug\r\nout of tree trunks of which I have spoken. They were drawn by naked\r\nslaves with ropes round their necks. The chieftain of the island, who,\r\ntogether with his wife and children, were all naked, travelled in\r\nthese barques. When the Spaniards went on shore the slaves, in\r\nobedience to their master's orders, made them understand by haughty\r\ngestures that they would have to obey the chief, and when they\r\nrefused, menaces and threats were employed. Their simplicity is such\r\nthat they felt neither fear nor admiration on beholding our ships and\r\nthe number and strength of our men. They seemed to think the Spaniards\r\nwould feel the same respect towards their chief as they did. Our\r\npeople perceived that they had to do with merchants returning from\r\nanother country, for they hold markets. The merchandise consisted of\r\nbells, razors, knives, and hatchets made of a yellow and translucent\r\nstone; they are fastened in handles of hard and polished wood. There\r\nwere also household utensils for the kitchen, and pottery of artistic\r\nshapes, some made of wood and some made of that same clear stone; and\r\nchiefly draperies and different articles of spun cotton in brilliant\r\ncolours. The Spaniards captured the chief, his family and everything\r\nhe possessed; but the Admiral soon afterwards ordered him to be set at\r\nliberty and the greater part of their property restored, hoping thus\r\nto win their friendship.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: This direct violation of his orders was due to his wish\r\nto trade one of his vessels, which was a slow sailer, for a quicker\r\ncraft.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3: Guanaya or Bouacia, lying off the coast of Honduras.]\r\n\r\nHaving procured some information concerning the country towards the\r\nwest, Columbus proceeded in that direction and, a little more than ten\r\nmiles farther, he discovered a vast country which the natives call\r\nQuiriquetana, but which he called Ciamba. There he caused the Holy\r\nSacrifice to be celebrated upon the shore. The natives were numerous\r\nand wore no clothing. Gentle and simple, they approached our people\r\nfearlessly and admiringly, bringing them their own bread and fresh\r\nwater. After presenting their gifts they turned upon their heels\r\nbowing their heads respectfully. In exchange for their presents, the\r\nAdmiral gave them some European gifts, such as strings of beads,\r\nmirrors, needles, pins, and other objects unknown to them.\r\n\r\nThis vast region is divided into two parts, one called Taïa and the\r\nother called Maïa.[4] The whole country is fertile, well shaded, and\r\nenjoys delightful temperature. In fertility of soil it yields to\r\nnone, and the climate is temperate. It possesses both mountains and\r\nextensive plains, and everywhere grass and trees grow. Spring and\r\nautumn seem perpetual, for the trees keep their leaves during the\r\nwhole year, and bear fruit. Groves of oak and pine are numerous, and\r\nthere are seven varieties of palms of which some bear dates, while\r\nothers are without fruit. Vines loaded with ripe grapes grow\r\nspontaneously amid the trees, but they are wild vines and there is\r\nsuch an abundance of useful and appetising fruits that nobody bothers\r\nto cultivate vineyards. The natives manufacture their _machanes_, that\r\nis to say swords, and the darts they throw, out of a certain kind\r\nof palm-wood. Much cotton is found in this country as well as\r\nmirobolanes, of various kinds, such as doctors call _emblicos_[5] and\r\n_chebules_; maize, yucca, ages, and potatoes, all grow in this country\r\nas they do everywhere on the continent. The animals are lions, tigers,\r\nstags, deer, and other similar beasts. The natives fatten those birds\r\nwe have mentioned, as resembling peahens in colour, size, and taste.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: This is the first mention of the word _Maya_. The traders\r\nwhom Columbus met were doubtless Mayas, coming from some of the\r\ngreat fairs or markets. For the second time, he brushed past the\r\ncivilisation of Yucatan and Mexico, leaving to later comers the glory\r\nof their discovery.]\r\n\r\n[Note 5: _Myrobolanos etiam diversarum specierum, emblicos puta et\r\nchebulos medicorum appellatione_.]\r\n\r\nThe natives of both sexes are said to be tall and well proportioned.\r\nThey wear waist-cloths and bandolets of spun cotton in divers colours,\r\nand they ornament themselves by staining their bodies with black and\r\nred colours, extracted from the juice of certain fruits cultivated for\r\nthat purpose in their gardens, just as did the Agathyrsi. Some of them\r\nstain the entire body, others only a part. Ordinarily they draw upon\r\ntheir skin designs of flowers, roses, and intertwined nets, according\r\nto each one's fancy. Their language bears no resemblance to that of\r\nthe neighbouring islanders. Torrential streams run in a westerly\r\ndirection. Columbus resolved to explore this country towards the\r\nwest, for he remembered Paria, Boca de la Sierpe, and other countries\r\nalready discovered to the east, believing they must be joined to the\r\nland where he was; and in this he was not deceived.\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth day of the calends of September the Admiral left\r\nQuiriquetana. After sailing thirty leagues, he came to a river, in the\r\nestuary of which he took fresh water. The coast was clear of rocks and\r\nreefs, and everywhere there was good anchorage. He writes, however,\r\nthat the ocean current was so strong against him that in forty days'\r\nsailing it was with the greatest difficulty he covered seventy\r\nleagues, and then only by tacking. From time to time, when he sought\r\ntowards nightfall to forestall the danger of being wrecked in the\r\ndarkness on that unknown coast, and tried to draw near to land, he was\r\nbeaten back. He reports that within a distance of eight leagues he\r\ndiscovered three rivers of clear water, upon whose banks grew canes as\r\nthick round as a man's leg. The waters of these streams are full of\r\nfish and immense turtles, and everywhere were to be seen multitudes of\r\ncrocodiles, drinking in the sun with huge yawning mouths. There were\r\nplenty of other animals of which the Admiral does not give the names.\r\nThe aspect of this country presents great variety, being in some\r\nplaces rocky and broken up into sharp promontories and jagged rocks,\r\nwhile in others the fertility of the soil is unexcelled by that of\r\nany known land. From one shore to another the names of the chiefs and\r\nprincipal inhabitants differ; in one place they are called caciques,\r\nas we have already said; in another _quebi_, farther on _tiba_. The\r\nprincipal natives are sometimes called _sacchus_ and sometimes _jura_.\r\nA man who has distinguished himself in conflict with an enemy and\r\nwhose face is scarred, is regarded as a hero and is called _cupra_,\r\nThe people are called _chyvis_, and a man is _home_. When they wish to\r\nsay, \"That's for you, my man,\" the phrase is, \"_Hoppa home_.\"\r\n\r\nAnother great river navigable for large ships was discovered, in the\r\nmouth of which lie four small islands, thickly grown with flowers and\r\ntrees. Columbus called them Quatro Tempore. Thirteen leagues farther\r\non, always sailing eastwards against adverse currents, he discovered\r\ntwelve small islands; and as these produced a kind of fruit resembling\r\nour limes, he called them Limonares. Twelve leagues farther, always\r\nin the same direction, he discovered a large harbour extending three\r\nleagues into the interior of the country, and into which flows an\r\nimportant river. It was at this spot that Nicuesa was afterwards lost\r\nwhen searching for Veragua, as we have already related; and for this\r\nreason later explorers have named it Rio de los Perdidos. Continuing\r\nhis course against the ocean current, the Admiral discovered a number\r\nof mountains, valleys, rivers, and harbours; the atmosphere was laden\r\nwith balmy odours.\r\n\r\nColumbus writes that not one of his men fell ill till he reached a\r\nplace the natives call Quicuri,[6] which is a point or cape where the\r\nport of Cariai lies. The Admiral called it Mirobolan because trees of\r\nthat name grew there spontaneously. At the port of Cariai about two\r\nhundred natives appeared, each armed with three or four spears; but\r\nmild-mannered and hospitable. As they did not know to what strange\r\nrace the Spaniards belonged, they prepared to receive them and asked\r\nfor a parley. Amicable signs were exchanged and they swam out to our\r\npeople, proposing to trade and enter into commercial relations. In\r\norder to gain their confidence, the Admiral ordered some European\r\narticles to be distributed gratuitously amongst them. These they\r\nrefused to accept, by signs, for nothing they said was intelligible.\r\nThey suspected the Spaniards of setting a trap for them in offering\r\nthese presents, and refused to accept their gifts. They left\r\neverything that was given them on the shore.[7] Such are the courtesy\r\nand generosity of these people of Cariai, that they would rather give\r\nthan receive.\r\n\r\n[Note 6: Quiribiri. Columbus arrived there on September 25th.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7: Suspicion and mistrust were mutual, for Columbus thought\r\nthe natives were practising magic when they cast perfumes before them,\r\nas they cautiously advanced towards him; he afterwards described them\r\nas powerful magicians.]\r\n\r\nThey sent two young girls, virgins of remarkable beauty, to our men,\r\nand gave it to be understood that they might take them away. These\r\nyoung girls, like all the other women, wore waist-cloths made of\r\nbandelets of cotton, which is the costume of the women of Cariai. The\r\nmen on the contrary go naked. The women cut their hair, or let it grow\r\nbehind and shave the forehead; then they gather it up in bands of\r\nwhite stuff and twist it round the head, just as do our girls. The\r\nAdmiral had them clothed and gave them presents, and a bonnet of red\r\nwool stuff for their father; after which he sent them away. Later all\r\nthese things were found upon the shore, because he had refused their\r\npresents. Two men, however, left voluntarily with Columbus, in order\r\nto learn our language and to teach it to their own people.\r\n\r\nThe tides are not very perceptible on that coast. This was discovered\r\nby observing the trees growing not far from the shore and on the river\r\nbanks. Everybody who has visited these regions agrees on this point.\r\nThe ebb and flow are scarcely perceptible, and only affect a part of\r\nthe shores of the continent, and likewise of all the islands. Columbus\r\nrelates that trees grow in the sea within sight of land, drooping\r\ntheir branches towards the water once they have grown above the\r\nsurface. Sprouts, like graftings of vines, take root and planted in\r\nthe earth they, in their turn, become trees of the same evergreen\r\nspecies. Pliny has spoken of such trees in the second book of his\r\nnatural history, but those he mentions grew in an arid soil and not in\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe same animals we have above described exist in Cariai. There is,\r\nhowever, one of a totally different kind, which resembles a large\r\nmonkey, but is provided with a much larger and stronger tail. Hanging\r\nby this tail, it swings to and fro three or four times, and then jumps\r\nfrom tree to tree as though it were flying.[8] One of our archers shot\r\none with his arrow, and the wounded monkey dropped onto the ground\r\nand fiercely attacked the man who had wounded it. The latter defended\r\nhimself with his sword and cut off the monkey's arm, and despite its\r\ndesperate efforts, captured it. When brought in contact with men, on\r\nboard the ship, it gradually became tame. While it was kept chained,\r\nother hunters brought from the swamps a wild boar which they had\r\npursued through the forests, desiring to eat some fresh meat. The men\r\nshowed this enraged wild boar to the monkey, and both animals bristled\r\nwith fury. The monkey, beside itself with rage, sprang upon the boar,\r\nwinding its tail about him, and with the one arm its conqueror had\r\nleft him, seized the boar by the throat and strangled it. Such are the\r\nferocious animals and others similar, which inhabit this country.\r\nThe natives of Cariai preserve the bodies of their chiefs and their\r\nrelatives, drying them upon hurdles and then packing them in leaves;\r\nbut the common people bury their dead in the forest.\r\n\r\n[Note 8: Possibly the _simia seniculus_.]\r\n\r\nLeaving Cariai and sailing a distance of twenty leagues the Spaniards\r\ndiscovered a gulf of such size that they thought that it must have a\r\ncircumference of twelve leagues. Four small fertile islands, separated\r\nfrom one another by narrow straits, lie across the opening of this\r\ngulf, making it a safe harbour.\r\n\r\nWe have elsewhere called the port, situated at the extreme point, by\r\nits native name of Cerabaroa; but it is only the right coast upon\r\nentering the gulf bears that name, the left coast being called\r\nAburema. Numerous and fertile islands dot the gulf, and the bottom\r\naffords excellent anchorage. The clearness of the water makes it\r\neasily discernible, and fish are very abundant. The country round\r\nabout is equal in fertility to the very best. The Spaniards captured\r\ntwo natives who wore gold necklaces, which they called guanines. These\r\ncollars are delicately wrought in the form of eagles, lions, or other\r\nsimilar animals, but it was observed that the metal was not very pure.\r\nThe two natives, brought from Cariai, explained that both the regions\r\nof Cerabaroa and Aburema were rich in gold, and that all the gold\r\ntheir countrymen required for ornaments was obtained from thence by\r\ntrading. They added that, in six villages of Cerabaroa, situated a\r\nshort distance in the interior of the country, gold was found; for\r\nfrom the earliest times they had traded with those tribes. The names\r\nof those five villages are Chirara, Puren, Chitaza, Jurech, and\r\nAtamea.\r\n\r\nAll the men of the province of Cerabaroa go entirely naked, but they\r\npaint their bodies in different ways, and they love to wear garlands\r\nof flowers on their heads, and bands made from the claws of lions and\r\ntigers. The women wear narrow waist-cloths of cotton.\r\n\r\nLeaving this harbour and following along the same coast, a distance\r\nof eighteen leagues, the Spaniards came upon a band of three hundred\r\nnaked men, upon the bank of the river they had just discovered. These\r\nmen uttered threatening shouts and, filling their mouths with water\r\nand the herbs of the coast, spat at them. Throwing their javelins,\r\nbrandishing their lances and machanes, which we have already said were\r\nwooden swords, they strove to repel our men from the coast. They were\r\npainted in different fashions; some of them painted the whole body\r\nexcept the face, others only a part. They gave it to be understood\r\nthat they wished neither peace nor trading relations with the\r\nSpaniards. The Admiral ordered several cannon-shots to be fired, but\r\nso as to kill nobody, for he always showed himself disposed to use\r\npeaceable measures with these new people. Frightened by the noise, the\r\nnatives fell on the ground imploring peace, and in this wise trading\r\nrelations were established. In exchange for their gold and guanines\r\nthey received glass beads and other similar trifles. These natives\r\nhave drums and sea-shell trumpets, which they use to excite their\r\ncourage when going into battle.\r\n\r\nThe following rivers are found along this part of the coast: the\r\nAcateba, the Quareba, the Zobroba, the Aiaguitin, the Wrida, the\r\nDuribba, and the Veragua. Gold is found everywhere. Instead of cloaks,\r\nthe natives wear large leaves on their heads as a protection against\r\nthe heat or the rain.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral afterwards coasted along the shores of Ebetere and\r\nEmbigar. Two rivers, Zahoran and Cubigar, remarkable for their volume\r\nand the quantity of fish they contain, water these coasts.\r\n\r\nBeyond a distance of fifty leagues, gold is no longer found. Only\r\nthree leagues away stands a rock which, as we have already stated in\r\nour description of Nicuesa's unfortunate voyage, the Spaniards called\r\nPenon and which the natives call Vibba.\r\n\r\nIn the same neighbourhood and about two leagues distant is the bay\r\nColumbus discovered and named Porto Bello. The country, which has\r\ngold and is called by the natives Xaguaguara is very populous but the\r\ninhabitants are naked. The cacique of Xaguaguara paints himself\r\nblack, and his subjects are painted red. The cacique and seven of his\r\nprincipal followers wore leaves of gold in their noses, hanging down\r\nto their lips, and in their opinion no more beautiful ornament exists.\r\nThe men cover their sexual organs with a sea-shell, and the women wear\r\na band of cotton stuff.\r\n\r\nThere is a fruit growing in their gardens which resembles a\r\npine-nut;[9]we have elsewhere said that it grows upon a plant,\r\nresembling an artichoke, and that the fruit, which is not unworthy\r\nof a king's table, is perishable; I have spoken elsewhere at length\r\nconcerning these. The natives call the plant bearing this fruit\r\n_hibuero_. From time to time crocodiles are found which, when they\r\ndive or scramble away, leave behind them an odour more delicate than\r\nmusk or castor. The natives who live along the banks of the Nile\r\nrelate the same fact concerning the female of the crocodile, whose\r\nbelly exhales the perfumes of Araby.\r\n\r\n[Note 9: The pineapple.]\r\n\r\nFrom this point the Admiral put his fleet about, and returned over\r\nhis course, for he could no longer battle against the contrary\r\ncurrents.[10] Moreover, his ships were rotting from day to day, their\r\nhulks being eaten into by the sharp points of worms engendered by the\r\nsun from the waters of these regions situated near the equator. The\r\nVenetians call these worms _bissa_, and quantities of them come into\r\nlife in both the ports of Alexandria, in Egypt. These worms, which are\r\na cubit long and sometimes more, and never thicker than your little\r\nfinger, undermine the solidity of ships which lie too long at anchor.\r\nThe Spanish sailors call this pest _broma_. It was therefore because\r\nhe feared the _bromas_ and was wearied out with struggling against the\r\ncurrents that the Admiral allowed his ships to be carried by the ocean\r\ntowards the west. Two leagues distant from Veragua he sailed up the\r\nriver Hiebra, since it was navigable for the largest vessels. Though\r\nit is less important, yet the Veragua gives its name to the country,\r\nsince the ruler of that region, which is watered by both rivers, has\r\nhis residence on the bank of the Veragua.\r\n\r\n[Note 10: Columbus describes the storms which prevailed during\r\nthat entire month of December as the most formidable he had ever\r\nexperienced; on the thirteenth his vessels had the narrowest possible\r\nescape from a waterspout.]\r\n\r\nLet us now relate the good and ill fortune they there encountered.\r\nColumbus established himself on the banks of the Hiebra, sending his\r\nbrother Bartholomew Columbus, Adelantado of Hispaniola, in command of\r\nsixty-eight men in ships' boats to Veragua. The cacique of the country\r\ncame down the river with a fleet of canoes to meet the Adelantado.\r\nThis man was naked and unarmed, and was accompanied by a numerous\r\nfollowing. Hardly had a few words been exchanged when the followers of\r\nthe cacique, fearing that he might weary himself or forget his\r\nroyal dignity by standing while he talked, carried a stone from the\r\nneighbouring bank, and after washing and polishing it with care,\r\nrespectfully tendered it to their chief to serve as a chair. When\r\nseated, the cacique seemed to convey by signs to the Spaniards that he\r\npermitted them to sail on the rivers of his territory.\r\n\r\nThe sixth of the ides of February the Adelantado marched along the\r\nbanks of the river Veragua, leaving his boats behind. He came to\r\nthe Duraba, a stream richer in gold than the Hiebra or the Veragua;\r\nmoreover, in all these regions gold is found amongst the roots of the\r\ntrees, along the banks and amongst the rocks and stones left by the\r\ntorrents. Wherever they dug a palm deep, gold was found mingled with\r\nthe earth turned out. This decided the attempt to found a colony, but\r\nthe natives opposed this project, for they foresaw their own prompt\r\ndestruction. They armed themselves, and, uttering horrible cries,\r\nthey attacked our men who were engaged in building cabins. This first\r\nattack was, with difficulty, repelled. The natives threw darts from a\r\ndistance and then, gradually drawing nearer, they used their wooden\r\nswords and machanes, in a furious assault. So greatly enraged were\r\nthey that, astonishing as it may seem, they were not frightened either\r\nby bows, arquebuses, or the noise of the cannon fired from the ships.\r\nOnce they drew off, but soon returned to the charge in greater numbers\r\nand more furiously than before. They preferred to die rather than see\r\ntheir land occupied by the Spaniards whom they were perfectly willing\r\nto receive as guests, but whom they rejected as inhabitants. The more\r\nthe Spaniards defended themselves, the more did the multitude of their\r\nassailants increase, directing their attack sometimes on the front,\r\nsometimes on the flank, without cessation both day and night.\r\nFortunately the fleet at anchorage assured the Spaniards a secure\r\nretreat and, deciding to abandon the attempt to colonise there, they\r\nreturned on board.\r\n\r\nTheir return to Jamaica, which is the island lying south and near to\r\nCuba and Hispaniola was accomplished with great difficulty, for their\r\nships had been so eaten by bromas,--to use a Spanish word--that they\r\nwere like sieves and almost went to pieces during the voyage. The men\r\nsaved themselves by working incessantly, bailing out the water that\r\nrushed in through great fissures in the ship's side and finally,\r\nexhausted by fatigue, they succeeded in reaching Jamaica. Their ships\r\nsank; and leaving them there stranded, they passed six months in\r\nthe power of the barbarians, a more wretched existence than that of\r\nAlcimenides as described by Virgil. They were forced to live on what\r\nthe earth produced or what it pleased the natives to give them. The\r\nmortal enmities existing amongst the savage caciques were of some\r\nservice to the Spaniards; for to secure their alliance the caciques\r\ndistributed bread to the starving whenever they were about to\r\nundertake a campaign. O how sad and wretched it is, Most Holy Father,\r\nto eat the bread of charity! Your Holiness may well understand,\r\nespecially when man is deprived of wine, meat, different kinds of\r\ncheeses, and of everything to which from their infancy the stomachs of\r\nEuropeans are accustomed.\r\n\r\nUnder the stress of necessity the Admiral resolved to tempt fortune.\r\nDesiring to know what destiny God reserved for him, he took counsel\r\nwith his intendant, Diego Mendez,[11] and two islanders of Jamaica who\r\nwere familiar with those waters. Mendez started in a canoe, although\r\nthe sea was already ruffled. From reef to reef and from rock to rock,\r\nhis narrow skiff tossed by the waves, Diego nevertheless succeeded in\r\nreaching the extreme point of Hispaniola which is some forty leagues\r\ndistant from Jamaica. The two natives returned joyously, anticipating\r\nthe reward promised them by Columbus. Mendez made his way on foot to\r\nSanto Domingo, the capital of the island, where he rented two boats\r\nand set out to rejoin his commander. All the Spaniards returned\r\ntogether to Hispaniola, but in a state of extreme weakness and\r\nexhaustion from their privations. I do not know what has since\r\nhappened to them.[12] Let us now resume our narrative.\r\n\r\n[Note 11: The events of this fourth voyage are related in\r\nthe interesting _Relacion hecha par Diego Mendez de algunos\r\naconticimientos del ultimo viaje del Almirante Don Christobal Colon_.\r\nKing Ferdinand afterwards granted Mendez a canoe in his armorial\r\nbearings, in memory of the services he had rendered.]\r\n\r\n[Note 12: Columbus reached Santo Domingo on August 18th, and there\r\nrested until September 12th, when he embarked for Spain landing at San\r\nLucar on November 7.]\r\n\r\nAccording to his letters and the reports of his companions, all the\r\nregions explored by Columbus are well wooded at all seasons of the\r\nyear, shaded by leafy green trees. Moreover, what is more important,\r\nthey are healthy. Not a man of his crew was ever ill or exposed to the\r\nrigours of cold nor the heats of summer throughout the whole extent of\r\nfifty leagues between the great harbour of Cerabaro and the Hiebra and\r\nVeragua rivers.\r\n\r\nAll the inhabitants of Cerabaro and the neighbourhood of Hiebra and\r\nVeragua only seek gold at certain fixed periods. They are just as\r\ncompetent as our miners who work the silver and iron mines. From long\r\nexperience, from the aspect of the torrent whose waters they divert,\r\nfrom the colour of the earth and various other signs, they know where\r\nthe richest gold deposits are; they believe in a tradition of their\r\nancestors which teaches that there is a divinity in gold, and they\r\ntake care only to look for this metal after purifying themselves. They\r\nabstain from carnal and other pleasures, also eating and drinking in\r\ngreat moderation, during the time they seek gold. They think that men\r\nlive and die just like animals, and have, therefore, no religion.\r\nNevertheless they venerate the sun, and salute the sunrise with\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nLet us now speak of the mountains and the general aspect of the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nLofty mountains[13] which end in a ridge extending from east to west\r\nare seen in the distance towards the south from all along the coast.\r\nWe believe this range separates the two seas of which we have already\r\nspoken at length, and that it forms a barrier dividing their waters\r\njust as Italy separates the Tyrrhenian from the Adriatic Sea. From\r\nwherever they sail, between Cape San Augustins, belonging to the\r\nPortuguese and facing the Atlas, as far as Uraba and the port of\r\nCerabaro and the other western lands recently discovered, the\r\nnavigators behold during their entire voyage, whether near at hand or\r\nin the distance mountain ranges; sometimes their slopes are gentle,\r\nsometimes lofty, rough, and rocky, or perhaps clothed with woods and\r\nshrubbery. This is likewise the case in the Taurus, and on the slopes\r\nof our Apennines, as well as on other similar ranges. As is the case\r\nelsewhere, beautiful valleys separate the mountain peaks. The peaks of\r\nthe range marking the frontier of Veragua are believed to rise above\r\nthe clouds, for they are very rarely visible because of the almost\r\ncontinuous density of mists and clouds.\r\n\r\n[Note 13: The Cordilleras on the Isthmus of Panama.]\r\n\r\nThe Admiral, who first explored this region, believes these peaks\r\nrise to a height of forty miles, and he says that at the base of the\r\nmountains there is a road leading to the South Sea. He compares its\r\nposition with that of Venice in relation to Genoa, or Janua, as the\r\ninhabitants who boast that Janus was their founder, call their city.\r\nThe Admiral believes that this continent extends to the west and that\r\nthe greater part of its lands lies in that direction. In like manner\r\nwe observe that the leg forming Italy branches out beyond the Alps\r\ninto the countries of the Gauls, the Germans, the Pannonians, and\r\nultimately those of the Sarmats and the Scythians extending to the\r\nRiphe Mountains and the glacial sea, not to mention Thrace, all\r\nGreece, and the countries ending towards the south at Cape Malea and\r\nthe Hellespont, and north at the Euxine and the Palus Maeotidus. The\r\nAdmiral believes that on the left and west, this continent joins on\r\nto the India of the Ganges, and that towards the right it extends\r\nnorthwards to the glacial sea and the north pole, lying beyond the\r\nlands of the Hyperboreans; the two seas, that is to say the southern\r\nand the northern ocean, would thus join one another at the angles of\r\nthis continent. I do not believe all its coasts are washed by the\r\nocean, as is our Europe which the Hellespont, the Tanais, the glacial\r\nocean, the Spanish sea and the Atlantic completely surround. In my\r\nopinion the strong ocean currents running towards the west prevent\r\nthese two seas from being connected, and I suppose, as I have said\r\nabove, that it does join on to northern lands.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken enough about longitude, Most Holy Father; let us see\r\nwhat are the theories concerning latitude.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that the distance separating the South Sea from\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean is a very small one; for this fact was demonstrated\r\nduring the expedition of Vasco Nuñez and his companions. Just as our\r\nAlps in Europe, narrow in some places and broaden out over a greater\r\nextent in others, so by an analogous arrangement of nature this new\r\ncontinent lengthens in some places, extending to a great distance, and\r\nin others it narrows by gulfs which, from the opposite seas, encroach\r\non the land between them. For example: at both Uraba and Veragua the\r\ndistance between the two oceans is trifling, while in the region of\r\nthe Maragnon River, on the contrary, it is vastly extended. That\r\nis, if the Maragnon is indeed a river and not a sea. I incline\r\nnevertheless to the first hypothesis, because its waters are fresh.\r\nThe immense torrents necessary to feed such a stream could certainly\r\nnot exist in a small space. The same applies in the case of the river\r\nDobaiba,[14] which flows into the sea at the gulf of Uraba, by an\r\nestuary three miles wide and forty-five ells deep; it must be supposed\r\nthat there is a large country amongst the mountains of Dobaiba from\r\nwhich this river flows. It is claimed that it is formed by four\r\nstreams descending from these mountains, and the Spaniards have named\r\nit San Juan. Where it falls into the gulf, it has seven mouths, like\r\nthe Nile. In this same Uraba region the continent diminishes in size\r\nin an astonishing manner, and it is said that in places its width is\r\nnot more than fifteen leagues. The country is impassable because of\r\nits swamps and quagmires which the Spaniards call _tremelaes_\r\nor _trampales_, or by other names _cenegales_, _sumineros_, and\r\n_zahoudaderos_.[15]\r\n\r\n[Note 14: The Dobaiba may be either the Magdalena or the Atrato.]\r\n\r\n[Note 15: All words meaning practically the same thing, viz., bog,\r\nquagmire, swamp, quicksand, etc., some of them evidently obsolete, as\r\nthey are not found in modern Spanish dictionaries.]\r\n\r\nBefore going farther it may not be useless to explain the derivation\r\nof the name of these mountains. According to native tradition there\r\nformerly lived a woman of great intelligence and extraordinary\r\nprudence, called Dobaiba. Even during her lifetime she was highly\r\nrespected, and after her death the natives of the country venerated\r\nher; and it is her name the country bears. She it is who sends thunder\r\nand lightning, who destroys the crops when she is vexed, for they\r\nchildishly believe, that Dobaiba becomes angry when they fail to offer\r\nsacrifices in her honour. There are deceivers who, under the pretence\r\nof religion, inculate this belief among the natives, hoping thereby to\r\nincrease the number of gifts offered by the latter to the goddess, and\r\nthus augment their own profits. This is enough on this subject.\r\n\r\nIt is related that in the swamps of this narrow part of the continent\r\nnumerous crocodiles, dragons, bats, and gnats exist, all of the most\r\nformidable description. In seeking to reach the southern sea, it is\r\nnecessary to go through the mountains, and to avoid the neighbourhood\r\nof these swamps. Some people claim that a single valley separates in\r\ntwo ranges the mountains facing the southern sea, and that in this\r\nvalley rises the river which the Spaniards have named Rio de los\r\nPerdidos, in memory of the catastrophe of Nicuesa and his companions.\r\nIt is not far distant from Cerabaro; but as its waters are fresh, I\r\nbelieve the people who sustain this theory are telling fables.\r\n\r\nLet us close this chapter with one last topic. To the right and left\r\nof Darien flow about a score of gold-producing rivers. We here repeat\r\nwhat has been told to us, and about which everybody agrees. When asked\r\nwhy they did not bring more considerable quantities of gold from that\r\ncountry, the Spaniards answer that miners are required, and that the\r\nexplorers of the new countries are not men inured to fatigue. This\r\nexplains why much less gold is obtained than the wealth of the soil\r\naffords. It would even seem that precious stones are found there.\r\nWithout repeating what I have said concerning Cariai and the\r\nneighbourhood of Santa Marta, here is another proof. A certain Andreas\r\nMorales, a pilot of these seas, who was a friend and companion of Juan\r\nde la Cosa during his lifetime, possessed a diamond which a young\r\nnative of Paria in Cumana had discovered. It was of the greatest\r\nrarity and is described as being as long as two middle finger joints.\r\nIt was as thick as the first thumb joint, was pointed at both ends,\r\nand had eight well-cut facets. When struck upon an anvil, it wore the\r\nfiles and hammers, itself remaining intact. This young man of Cumana\r\nwore it hanging round his neck, and he sold it to Andreas Morales for\r\nfive green glass beads because their colour pleased him. The Spaniards\r\nalso found topazes on the beach, but as they only think of gold, they\r\nturn their backs on these precious stones; for only gold attracts\r\nthem, only gold do they seek. Thus the majority of Spaniards despise\r\npeople who wear rings and precious stones, regarding it as almost a\r\ncontemptible thing to decorate one's self with precious stones. Our\r\npeople above all hold this opinion. Sometimes the nobles, for a\r\nwedding ceremony or a royal festival, like to display jewels in their\r\ngolden necklaces, or to embroider their costumes with pearls mixed\r\nwith diamonds; but on all other occasions they abstain, for it is\r\nconsidered effeminate to decorate one's self in this wise, just as it\r\nwould be to be perfumed with the odours of Araby. Any one they meet\r\nsmelling of musk or castor, they suspect of being given to guilty\r\npassions.\r\n\r\nFruit plucked from a tree argues that the tree bears fruit; a fish\r\ntaken from a river warrants the affirmation that fish live in the\r\nriver. In like manner a bit of gold or a single precious stone\r\njustifies the belief that the earth where they are found, produces\r\ngold and precious stones.\r\n\r\nThis must certainly be admitted. We have already related what the\r\ncompanions of Pedro Arias and some officials discovered at the port of\r\nSanta Marta in the Cariai region when they penetrated there with the\r\nwhole fleet. Every day the harvest increases, and overtops that of the\r\nlast. The exploits of Saturn and Hercules and other heroes, glorified\r\nby antiquity, are reduced to nothing. If the incessant efforts of the\r\nSpaniards result in new discoveries, we shall give our attention to\r\nthem. May Your Holiness fare well, and let me know your opinion upon\r\nthese aggrandisements of your Apostolic Chair, and thus encourage me\r\nin my future labours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery creature in this sublunary world, Most Holy Father, that gives\r\nbirth to something, either immediately afterwards closes the womb or\r\nrests for a period. The new continent, however, is not governed by\r\nthis rule, for each day it creates without ceasing and brings forth\r\nnew products, which continue to furnish men gifted with power and\r\nan enthusiasm for novelties, sufficient material to satisfy their\r\ncuriosity. Your Holiness may ask, \"Why this preamble?\" The reason is\r\nthat I had scarcely finished composing and dictating the story of the\r\nadventures of Vasco Nuñez and his companions during their exploration\r\nof the South Sea, and had hardly despatched that narration to Your\r\nHoliness by Giovanni Ruffo di Forli, Archbishop of Cosenza and\r\nGaleazzo Butrigario, Apostolic nuncios and stimulators of my somnolent\r\nspirits, than new letters[1] arrived from Pedro Arias whose departure\r\nlast year as commander of a fleet bound for the new continent we have\r\nalready announced. The General duly arrived with his soldiers and his\r\nships. These letters are signed by Juan Cabedo whom Your Holiness,\r\nupon the solicitation of the Catholic King, appointed Bishop of the\r\nprovince of Darien, and his signature is accompanied by those of the\r\nprincipal officials sent to administer the government, viz.: Alonzo\r\nde Ponte, Diego Marques, and Juan de Tavira. May Your Holiness,\r\ntherefore, deign to accept the narrative of this voyage.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: If still in existence these letters have yet to be\r\nfound.]\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the ides of April, 1514, Pedro Arias gave the signal to\r\nstart and sailed from the port of San Lucar de Barrameda, a fortified\r\nplace at the mouth of the Boetis, called by the Spaniards the\r\nGuadalquivir. From the mouth of the Boetis, to the seven Canary\r\nIslands the distance is about four hundred miles. Some people think\r\nthese islands correspond to the Fortunate Isles, but others hold a\r\ncontrary opinion. These islands are named as follows: Lancelota and\r\nFortaventura are the first sighted, after which the Grand Canary,\r\nfollowed by Teneriffe: Gomera lies a short distance to the north\r\nof Teneriffe and the islands of Palma and Ferro seem to form a\r\nrear-guard. After a voyage of eight days, Pedro Arias landed at\r\nGomera. His fleet consisted of seventeen vessels, carrying fifteen\r\nhundred men, to which number he had been restricted; for he left\r\nbehind him more than two thousand discontented and disconsolate men,\r\nwho begged to be allowed to embark at their own expense; such was\r\ntheir avidity for gold and such their desire to behold the new\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nPedro Arias stopped sixteen days at Gomera, to take on a supply of\r\nwood and water, and to repair his ships damaged by a storm, especially\r\nthe flag-ship, which had lost her rudder. The archipelago of the\r\nCanaries is indeed a most convenient port for navigators. The\r\nexpedition left the Canaries the nones of May, and saw no land until\r\nthe third day of the nones of June, when the ships approached the\r\nisland of the man-eating cannibals which has been named Domingo. On\r\nthis island, which is about eight hundred leagues from Gomera, Pedro\r\nArias remained four days and replenished his supply of water and wood.\r\nNot a man or a trace of a human being was discovered. Along the coast\r\nwere many crabs and huge lizards. The course afterwards passed by the\r\nislands of Madanino and Guadeloupe and Maria Galante, of which I have\r\nspoken at length in my First Decade. Pedro Arias also sailed over vast\r\nstretches of water full of grass[2]; neither the Admiral, Columbus,\r\nwho first discovered these lands and crossed this sea of grass, nor\r\nthe Spaniards accompanying Pedro Arias are able to explain the cause\r\nof this growth. Some people think the sea is muddy thereabouts and\r\nthe grasses, growing on the bottom, reach to the surface; similar\r\nphenomena being observed in lakes and large rivers of running waters.\r\nOthers do not think that the grasses grow in that sea, but are torn up\r\nby storms from the numerous reefs and afterwards float about; but it\r\nis impossible to prove anything because it is not known yet whether\r\nthey fasten themselves to the prows of the ships they follow or\r\nwhether they float after being pulled up. I am inclined to believe\r\nthey grow in those waters, otherwise the ships would collect them\r\nin their course,--just as brooms gather up all the rubbish in the\r\nhouse,--which would thus delay their progress.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: The _Mare Sargassum_ of the ancients: also called _Fucus\r\nNatans_, and by the Spaniards _Mar de Sargasso_. A curious marine\r\nmeadow nearly seven times larger than France, in extent, lying between\r\n19° and 34° north latitude. There is a lesser _Fucus_ bank between the\r\nBahamas and the Bermudas. Consult Aristotle, _Meteor_, ii., I, 14;\r\n_De mirabilibus auscutationibus_, p. 100; Theophrastus, _Historia\r\nPlantarum_, iv., 7; Arienus, _Ora Maritima_, v., 408; Humboldt,\r\n_Cosmos_, tom. ii.; Gaffarel, _La Mer des Sargasses_; Leps, _Bulletin\r\nde la Soc. Geog_., Sept., 1865.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth day of the ides of March snow-covered mountains were\r\nobserved. The sea runs strongly to the west and its current is as\r\nrapid as a mountain torrent. Nevertheless the Spaniards did not lay\r\ntheir course directly towards the west, but deviated slightly to the\r\nsouth. I hope to be able to demonstrate this by one of the tables of\r\nthe new cosmography which it is my intention to write, if God gives me\r\nlife. The Gaira River, celebrated for the massacre of the Spaniards\r\nduring the voyage of Roderigo Colmenares, which I have elsewhere\r\nrelated, rises in these mountains. Many other rivers water this coast.\r\nThe province of Caramaira has two celebrated harbours, the first being\r\nCarthagena and the second Santa Marta, these being their Spanish\r\nnames. A small province of the latter is called by the natives\r\nSaturma. The harbour of Santa Marta is very near the snow-covered\r\nmountains; in fact it lies at their foot. The port of Carthagena is\r\nfifty leagues from there, to the west. Wonderful things are written\r\nabout the port of Santa Marta, and all who come back tell such. Among\r\nthe latter is Vespucci,[3] nephew of Amerigo Vespucci of Florence who,\r\nat his death, bequeathed his knowledge of navigation and cosmography\r\nto his nephew. This young man has, in fact, been sent by the King\r\nas pilot to the flagship and commissioned to take the astronomical\r\nobservations. The steering has been entrusted to the principal pilot,\r\nJuan Serrano, a Castilian, who had often sailed in those parts. I have\r\noften invited this young Vespucci to my table, not only because he\r\npossesses real talent, but also because he has taken notes of all he\r\nobserved during his voyage.[4]\r\n\r\n[Note 3: He was appointed cartographer of the _Casa de\r\nContractacion_ at Seville, in 1512. Henry Harrisse makes frequent\r\nmention of the Vespucci in his work on the Cabots.]\r\n\r\n[Note 4: One of many instances of Peter Martyr's hospitality to\r\nmen of parts and activity, from whose conversation and narrations he\r\nset himself to glean the material for his writings. His information\r\nwas first-hand, and was frequently poured out to him over his\r\nhospitable board, under which the home-coming adventurers were glad to\r\nstretch their legs, while their genial host stimulated their memories\r\nand loosed their tongues with the generous wines of his adopted\r\ncountry.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the letters of Pedro Arias, and to the narrations of\r\nVespucci, what happened is as follows: It is believed that the natives\r\nbelong to the same race as the Caribs or Cannibals, for they are just\r\nas overbearing and cruel. They seek to repulse from their shores all\r\nSpaniards who approach for they consider them as enemies and are\r\ndetermined to prevent their landing, despite their attempts. These\r\nnaked barbarians are so determined and courageous, that they ventured\r\nto attack the entire squadron and tried to drive it from their coasts.\r\nThey threw themselves into the sea, like madmen, showing not the\r\nslightest fear of the number and size of our vessels. They attacked\r\nthe Spaniards with all sorts of darts; protected by the sides of the\r\nships and by their shields, the latter resisted, though two of them\r\nwere mortally wounded. It was then decided to fire cannon, and\r\nfrightened by the noise and the effect of the projectiles, the natives\r\nfled, believing the Spaniards commanded the thunder; for they are\r\nfrequently exposed to storms owing to the character of their country\r\nand the neighbourhood of lofty mountains. Although the enemy were\r\nconquered and dispersed, the Spaniards hesitated whether to go on\r\nshore or to remain on board their ships. A consultation was held in\r\nwhich different opinions were expressed. Fear counselled them to stop\r\nwhere they were, but human respect urged them to land. They feared the\r\npoisoned arrows which the natives shot with such sure aim, but on the\r\nother hand it seemed shameful, unworthy, and infamous to sail by with\r\nsuch a large fleet and so many soldiers without landing. Human respect\r\ncarried the day, and after landing by means of light barques, they\r\npursued the scattered natives.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report of Pedro Arias and the narrative of Vespucci,\r\nthe harbour is three leagues in circumference. It is a safe one, and\r\nits waters are so clear that at a depth of twenty cubits, the stones\r\non its bottom may be counted. Streams empty into the harbour but they\r\nare not navigable for large ships, only for native canoes. There is an\r\nextraordinary abundance of both fresh- and salt-water fish, of great\r\nvariety and good flavour. Many native fishing boats were found in\r\nthis harbour, and also a quantity of nets ingeniously made from stout\r\ngrasses worn by friction and interwoven with spun cotton cords. The\r\nnatives of Caramaira, Cariai, and Saturma are all skilful fishermen,\r\nand it is by selling their fish to the inland tribes that they procure\r\nthe products they need and desire.\r\n\r\nWhen the barbarians withdrew from the coast, the Spaniards entered\r\ntheir boios, that is to say their houses. The natives frequently\r\nattacked our men with fury, seeking to kill them all with flights\r\nof poisoned arrows. When they realised that their houses were to be\r\ninvaded and robbed, and particularly when they witnessed their women\r\nand the majority of their children carried into captivity, their fury\r\nincreased. The furniture found in these houses was discovered to be\r\nmade of large reeds gathered along the shore, or of various grasses\r\nresembling cords. Woven mats of various colours, and cotton hangings,\r\nupon which lions, eagles, tigers, and other figures were executed with\r\ngreat care and taste, were found. The doors of the houses and of the\r\nrooms inside were hung with snail-shells strung upon fine cord, which\r\nthe wind easily shook, producing a noise of rattling shells which\r\ndelighted them.\r\n\r\nFrom various sources astonishing tales of the natives have been told\r\nme. Amongst others, Gonzales Fernando Oviedo,[5] who is a royal\r\nofficial with the title of inspector, boasts that he has travelled\r\nextensively in the interior of the country. He found a piece of\r\nsapphire larger than a goose's egg, and upon the hills he explored\r\nwith about twenty men, he claims that he has seen a large quantity of\r\nemerald matrix, chalcedon, jasper, and great lumps of mountain amber.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: _Sommario dell'Indie Occidenti_, cap. lxxxii., in\r\nRamusio.]\r\n\r\nAttached to the tapestries woven with gold which the Caribs left\r\nbehind them in their houses when they fled, were precious stones:\r\nOviedo and his companions affirm that they saw them. The country also\r\nhas forests of scarlet wood and rich gold deposits. Everywhere along\r\nthe coast and on the banks of the rivers exist marcasites[6] which\r\nindicate the presence of gold. Oviedo further states that in a region\r\ncalled Zenu, lying ninety miles east of Darien, a kind of business is\r\ncarried on for which there are found in the native houses huge jars\r\nand baskets, cleverly made of reeds adapted to that purpose. These\r\nreceptacles are filled with dried and salted grasshoppers, crabs,\r\ncrayfish, and locusts, which destroy the harvests. When asked the\r\npurpose of these provisions, the natives replied they were destined\r\nto be sold to the people inland, and in exchange for these precious\r\ninsects and dried fish they procure the foreign products they require.\r\nThe natives live in scattered fashion, their houses not being built\r\ntogether. This land, inhabited by the people of Caramaira, is an\r\nElysian country, well cultivated, fertile, exposed neither to the\r\nrigours of winter nor the great heats of summer. Day and night are of\r\nabout equal length.\r\n\r\n[Note 6: A variety of iron pyrites.]\r\n\r\nAfter driving off the barbarians, the Spaniards entered a valley two\r\nleagues in breadth and three long, which extended to the grassy and\r\nwooded slopes of the mountains. Two other valleys, each watered by a\r\nriver, also open to the right and left at the foot of these mountains.\r\nOne is the Gaira, and the other has not yet received a name. There\r\nare, in these valleys, cultivated gardens, and fields watered by\r\ningeniously planned ditches. Our Milanese and Tuscans cultivate and\r\nwater their fields in precisely the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary food of these natives is the same as the others--agoes,\r\nyucca, maize, potatoes, fruits, and fish. They rarely eat human flesh,\r\nfor they do not often capture strangers. Sometimes they arm themselves\r\nand go hunting in neighbouring regions, but they do not eat one\r\nanother. There is, however, one fact sad to hear. These filthy eaters\r\nof men are reported to have killed myriads of their kind to satisfy\r\ntheir passion. Our compatriots have discovered a thousand islands as\r\nfair as Paradise, a thousand Elysian regions, which these brigands\r\nhave depopulated. Charming and blessed as they are, they are\r\nnevertheless deserted. From this sole instance Your Holiness may judge\r\nof the perversity of this brutal race. We have already said that\r\nthe island of San Juan lies near to Hispaniola and is called by the\r\nnatives Burichena. Now it is related that within our own time more\r\nthan five thousand islanders have been carried off from Burichena for\r\nfood, and were eaten by the inhabitants of these neighbouring islands\r\nwhich are now called Santa Cruz, Hayhay, Guadaloupe, and Queraqueira.\r\nBut enough has been said about the appetites of these filthy\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\nLet us now speak a little of the roots destined to become the food\r\nof Christians and take the place of wheaten bread, radishes, and our\r\nother vegetables. We have already said several times that the yucca\r\nwas a root from which the natives make a bread they like both in\r\nthe islands and on the continent; but we have not yet spoken of its\r\nculture, its growth, or of its several varieties. When planting yucca,\r\nthey dig a hole knee-deep in the ground, and pile the earth in heaps\r\nnine feet square, in each one of which they plant a dozen yucca roots\r\nabout six feet long, in such wise that all the ends come together\r\nin the centre of the mound. From their joining and even from their\r\nextremities, young roots fine as a hair sprout and, increasing little\r\nby little, attain, when they are full grown, the thickness and length\r\nof a man's arm, and often of his leg. The mounds of earth are thus\r\nconverted little by little into a network of roots. According to\r\ntheir description, the yucca requires at least half a year to reach\r\nmaturity, and the natives also say that if it is left longer in\r\nthe ground, for instance for two years, it improves and produces a\r\nsuperior quality of bread. When cut, the women break and mash it on\r\nstones prepared for the purpose, just as amongst us cheese is pressed;\r\nor they pack it into a bag made of grass or reeds from the riverside,\r\nafterwards placing a heavy stone on the bag and hanging it up for a\r\nwhole day to let the juice run off. This juice, as we have already\r\nsaid in speaking of the islanders, is dangerous; but if cooked, it\r\nbecomes wholesome, as is the case with the whey of our milk. Let us\r\nobserve, however, that this juice is not fatal to the natives of the\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of yucca, one of which being dearer and\r\nmore agreeable, is reserved for making the bread of the caciques.\r\nOther varieties are set aside for the nobles, and certain others for\r\nthe common people. When the juice has all run off, the pulp is spread\r\nout and cooked on slabs of earthenware made for the purpose, just\r\nas our people do cheese. This sort of bread is the most used and is\r\ncalled _cazabi_. It is said there are also several kinds of agoes\r\nand potatoes, and the natives use these more as vegetables than for\r\nbreadmaking, just as we do radishes, turnips, mushrooms, and other\r\nsimilar foods. Most of all do the natives like potatoes, which indeed\r\nare preferable to mushrooms, because of their flavour and softness,\r\nparticularly when of a superior quality. We have now spoken enough\r\nof roots, so let us come to another kind of bread. The natives have\r\nanother kind of grain similar to millet, save that the kernels are\r\nlarger. When there is a shortage of yucca, they grind it into flour by\r\nmashing it between stones; the bread made from this is coarser. This\r\ngrain is sown three times a year, since the fertility of the soil\r\ncorresponds to the evenness of the seasons. I have already spoken of\r\nthis in preceding places. When the Spaniards first arrived, all these\r\nroots and grains and maize, as well as various other kinds of fruit\r\ntrees were cultivated.\r\n\r\nIn Caramaira and Saturma there are such broad, straight roads that one\r\nmight think they had been drawn with a lead pencil. Among this people\r\nare found cups with handles, jugs, jars, long platters, and plates\r\nof earthenware, as well as amphoras of different colours for keeping\r\nwater fresh.\r\n\r\nWhen ordered to tender obedience to the King of Castile and to embrace\r\nour religion, or get out, the Indians replied with flights of poisoned\r\narrows. The Spaniards captured some of them, whom they immediately set\r\nat liberty after giving them some clothing. Some others they took on\r\nboard the ships and displayed our grandeur before them, so that they\r\nmight tell their compatriots; after which they released them, hoping\r\nthus to win their friendship. Gold has been proven to exist in all the\r\nrivers. Here and there in the native houses fresh meat of deer and\r\nwild boar was found; a food which they eat with great pleasure. These\r\nnatives also keep numbers of birds which they rear either for food or\r\nfor their pleasure. The climate is healthy; I may cite as a proof the\r\nfact that the Spaniards slept at night on the river banks and in the\r\nopen air, without anybody suffering from headache or pains.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards likewise found huge balls of spun cotton and bunches of\r\ndivers coloured feathers from which headdresses, similar to those of\r\nour cuirassiers, or mantles of state are made. These are elegancies\r\namong the natives. There was also a large number of bows and arrows.\r\n\r\nSometimes the bodies of their ancestors are burned and the bones\r\nburied, and sometimes they are preserved entire in their _boios_, that\r\nis to say houses, and treated with great respect; or again, they may\r\nbe ornamented with gold and precious stones. It was noted that the\r\nbreast ornaments, which they call _guanines_ were made of copper\r\nrather than gold, and it was surmised that they dealt with tricky\r\nstrangers who sold them these guanines, palming off upon them vile\r\nmetal for gold. Neither did the Spaniards discover the trick till they\r\nmelted these supposed valuables.\r\n\r\nSome architects who had wandered a short distance from the coast came\r\nupon some fragments of white marble, and they think that strangers\r\nmust at some time have landed there and quarried this marble from the\r\nmountains, leaving these fragments scattered about the plain. It was\r\nat this place that the Spaniards learned that the river Maragnon\r\nflows from the snow-covered mountains, its volume being increased by\r\nnumerous streams flowing into it. Its great size is due to the fact\r\nthat its course is long, and that it only reaches the sea after having\r\ntraversed well-watered regions.\r\n\r\nThe signal for departure was finally given. Nine hundred men who had\r\nbeen landed, assembled shouting joyfully, marching in order, loaded\r\nwith plunder, and quite showy with crowns, mantles, feathers, and\r\nnative military ornaments. The anchor was hoisted on the sixteenth day\r\nof the calends of July. The ships, damaged in frequent gales, had been\r\nrepaired, the flag-ship having especially suffered the loss of her\r\nrudder, as we have already mentioned. The fleet put out to sea in the\r\ndirection of Carthagena, and in obedience to the King's instructions\r\nravaged some islands inhabited by ferocious cannibals which lay in the\r\ncourse. The strong currents deceived Juan Serrano, chief pilot of the\r\nflag-ship, and his colleagues, though they boasted that they were\r\nwell acquainted with the nature of these currents. In one night, and\r\ncontrary to the general expectation, they made forty leagues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time has come, Most Holy Father, to philosophise a little, leaving\r\ncosmography to seek the causes of Nature's secrets. The ocean currents\r\nin those regions run towards the west, as torrents rushing down a\r\nmountain side. Upon this point the testimony is unanimous. Thus I find\r\nmyself uncertain when asked where these waters go which flow in a\r\ncircular and continuous movement from east to west, never to return\r\nto their starting-place; and how it happens that the west is not\r\nconsequently overwhelmed by these waters, nor the east emptied. If it\r\nbe true that these waters are drawn towards the centre of the earth,\r\nas is the case with all heavy objects, and that this centre, as some\r\npeople affirm, is at the equinoctial line, what can be the central\r\nreservoir capable of holding such a mass of waters? And what will be\r\nthe circumference filled with water, which will yet be discovered? The\r\nexplorers of these coasts offer no convincing explanation. There are\r\nother authors who think that a large strait exists at the extremity\r\nof the gulf formed by this vast continent and which, we have already\r\nsaid, is eight times larger than the ocean. This strait may lie to the\r\nwest of Cuba, and would conduct these raging waters to the west, from\r\nwhence they would again return to our east. Some learned men think the\r\ngulf formed by this vast continent is an enclosed sea, whose coasts\r\nbend in a northerly direction behind Cuba, in such wise that the\r\ncontinent would extend unbrokenly to the northern lands beneath the\r\npolar circle bathed by the glacial sea. The waters, driven back by\r\nthe extent of land, are drawn into a circle, as may be seen in rivers\r\nwhose opposite banks provoke whirlpools; but this theory does not\r\naccord with the facts. The explorers of the northern passages, who\r\nalways sailed westwards, affirm that the waters are always drawn\r\nin that direction, not however with violence, but by a long and\r\nuninterrupted movement.\r\n\r\nAmongst the explorers of the glacial region a certain Sebastiano\r\nCabotto, of Venetian origin, but brought by his parents in his infancy\r\nto England, is cited. It commonly happens that Venetians visit every\r\npart of the universe, for purposes of commerce. Cabotto equipped two\r\nvessels in England, at his own cost, and first sailed with three\r\nhundred men towards the north, to such a distance that he found\r\nnumerous masses of floating ice in the middle of the month of July.\r\nDaylight lasted nearly twenty-four hours, and as the ice had melted,\r\nthe land was free. According to his story he was obliged to tack and\r\ntake the direction of west-by-south. The coast bent to about the\r\ndegree of the strait of Gibraltar. Cabotto did not sail westward until\r\nhe had arrived abreast of Cuba, which lay on his left. In following\r\nthis coast-line which he called Bacallaos,[1] he says that he\r\nrecognised the same maritime currents flowing to the west that the\r\nCastilians noted when they sailed in southern regions belonging to\r\nthem. It is not merely probable, therefore, but becomes even necessary\r\nto conclude that between these two hitherto unknown continents there\r\nextend large openings through which the water flows from east to west.\r\nI think these waters flow all round the world in a circle, obediently\r\nto the Divine Law, and that they are not spewed forth and afterwards\r\nabsorbed by some panting Demogorgon. This theory would, up to a\r\ncertain point, furnish an explanation of the ebb and flow.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: The word _Bacallaos_ is thought to be of Basque origin.\r\nThis designation for codfish is extremely ancient, and the land thus\r\nnamed appears on the earliest maps of America.]\r\n\r\nCabotto calls these lands Terra de Bacallaos, because the neighbouring\r\nwaters swarm with fish similar to tunnies, which the natives call by\r\nthis name. These fish are so numerous that sometimes they interfere\r\nwith the progress of ships. The natives of these regions wear furs,\r\nand appear to be intelligent. Cabotto reports that there are many\r\nbears in the country, which live on fish. These animals plunge into\r\nthe midst of thick schools of fish, and seizing one fast in their\r\nclaws they drag it ashore to be devoured. They are not dangerous to\r\nmen. He claims to have seen the natives in many places in possession\r\nof copper. Cabotto frequents my house, and I have him sometimes at my\r\ntable.[2] He was called from England by our Catholic King after the\r\ndeath of Henry, King of that country, and he lives at court with us.\r\nHe is waiting, from day to day, to be furnished with ships with which\r\nhe will be able to discover this mystery of nature. I think he will\r\nleave on this expedition towards the month of March of next year,\r\n1516. If God gives me life, Your Holiness shall hear from me what\r\nhappens to him. There are not wanting people in Spain who affirm that\r\nCabotto is not the first discoverer of Terra de Bacallaos; they only\r\nconcede him the merit of having pushed out a little farther to the\r\nwest.[3] But this is enough about the strait and Cabotto.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Again we see Peter Martyr's system of collecting\r\ninformation illustrated. Cabot's discoveries on this voyage are\r\nindicated on Juan de la Cosa's map, of 1500. Henry VII. gave little\r\nsupport, and Cabot, therefore, withdrew from England. In 1516 he was\r\ngiven an appointment by King Ferdinand, with 50,000 maravedis yearly\r\nand an estate in Andalusia.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3: The Bacallaos coast was discovered by the Scandinavians\r\nin the tenth century, and was known to the Venetians in the\r\nfourteenth. Basque, Breton, and Norman fishermen visited it in the\r\nfollowing century.]\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the Spaniards. Pedro Arias and his men passed\r\nthe length of the harbour of Carthagena and the islands inhabited by\r\nCaribs, named San Bernardo's Islands. They left the entire country of\r\nCaramaira behind them, without approaching it. They were driven by a\r\ntempest upon an island which we have already mentioned as Fuerte, and\r\nwhich is about fifty leagues distant from the entrance of the gulf\r\nof Uraba. In this island they found, standing in the houses of the\r\nislanders, a number of baskets made out of marine plants and filled\r\nwith salt. This island is indeed celebrated for its salines and the\r\nnatives procure whatever they need by the sale of salt.\r\n\r\nAn enormous pelican, larger than a vulture and remarkable for the\r\ndimensions of its throat, fell upon the flagship. It is the same bird,\r\nwhich, according to the testimony of several writers, formerly lived\r\ndomesticated in the marshes of Ravenna. I do not know if this is still\r\nthe case. This pelican let itself be easily caught, after which they\r\ntook it from one vessel to another: it soon died. A flock of twenty\r\nsuch birds were seen on the coast in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe flag-ship was larger than the other vessels, but as she had been\r\ndamaged and was no longer serviceable, she was left behind; she will\r\nrejoin the fleet when the sea is calmer. The eleventh day of the\r\ncalends of July the fleet reached Darien, the flag-ship arriving four\r\ndays later, but without cargo. The colonists of Darien under the\r\nleadership of Vasco Nuñez Balboa, of whom we have elsewhere written at\r\nlength, came down to meet the new arrivals singing the psalm _Te Deum\r\nLaudamus_. Each of them offered voluntary hospitality in his house,\r\nbuilt after the plan of native cabins.\r\n\r\nThis country may very properly be called a province, because it\r\nhas been conquered and all of its chiefs dethroned. The Spaniards\r\nrefreshed themselves with native fruits and bread made either of\r\nroots or of maize. The fleet brought other provisions, for example\r\nsalt-meats, salt-fish, and barrels of wheat flour.\r\n\r\nBehold the royal fleet at anchor in these strange countries and behold\r\nthe Spaniards established, not only in the Tropic of Cancer,\r\nbut almost on the equator,--contrary to the opinion of many\r\nscientists,--ready to settle and to found colonies.\r\n\r\nThe day after landing, four hundred and fifty colonists of Darien were\r\ninvited to a meeting. Both in public and in private, by groups or\r\nsingly, they were questioned concerning the report of Vasco, Admiral\r\nof the South Sea, or, as this officer is termed in Spanish, the\r\nAdelantado. The truth of all he had reported to the King concerning\r\nthis South Sea was admitted. According to the opinion of Vasco\r\nhimself, the first thing to be done was to build forts in the\r\nterritories of Comogre, Pochorrosa, and Tumanama, which would later\r\nform centres of colonisation. A _hidalgo_ of Cordova, Captain Juan\r\nAyora, was chosen to carry out this plan, for which purpose he was\r\ngiven four hundred men, four caravels, and a small boat. Ayora first\r\nlanded in the port of Comogra, described in letters that have been\r\nreceived, as distant about twenty-five leagues from Darien. From that\r\npoint he despatched one hundred and fifty of his men by a more direct\r\nroad than the one indicated, in the direction of the South Sea. It was\r\nsaid that the distance between the port of Comogra and the gulf of St.\r\nMiguel was only twenty-six leagues. The other company of two hundred\r\nand fifty men would remain at Comogra to render assistance to those\r\ncoming and going. The hundred and fifty men chosen to march to the\r\nSouth Sea took with them interpreters, some of whom were Spaniards who\r\nhad learned the language spoken in the region of the South Sea, from\r\nslaves captured by Vasco when he explored the country; while others\r\nwere slaves who already understood the Spanish tongue. The harbour of\r\nPochorrosa is seven leagues distant from that of Comogra. Ayora, the\r\nlieutenant of Pedro Arias, was to leave fifty men and the small boat,\r\nwhich would serve as a courier, at Pochorroso, so that these boats\r\nmight serve to carry news to the lieutenant and to the colonists of\r\nDarien, just as relays are arranged on land. It was also intended to\r\nform a station in the territory of Tumanama, of which the capital is\r\ntwenty leagues distant from that of Pochorrosa.\r\n\r\nOut of the hundred and fifty men assigned to Ayora, fifty were chosen\r\namong the older colonists of Darien, they being persons of large\r\nexperience who would take charge of the newcomers and serve them as\r\nguides.\r\n\r\nWhen these measures were adopted, it was determined to report to the\r\nKing, and at the same time to announce to him as a positive fact that\r\nthere existed in the neighbourhood a cacique called Dobaiba, whose\r\nterritory had rich gold deposits, which had till then been respected\r\nbecause he was very powerful. His country extended along the great\r\nriver which we have elsewhere mentioned. According to common report,\r\nall the countries under his authority were rich in gold. Fifty leagues\r\ndivided Darien from the residence of Dobaiba. The natives affirmed\r\nthat gold would be found immediately the frontier was crossed. We have\r\nelsewhere related that only three leagues from Darien the Spaniards\r\nalready possessed quite important gold mines, which are being worked.\r\nMoreover, in many places gold is found by breaking the soil, but it\r\nis believed to be more abundant in the territories of Dobaiba. In\r\nthe First Decade I addressed to Your Holiness, I had mentioned this\r\nDobaiba, but the Spaniards were mistaken concerning him, for they\r\nthought they had met fishermen of Dobaiba and believed that Dobaiba\r\nwas the swampy region where they had encountered these men. Pedro\r\nArias, therefore, decided to lead a selected troop into that country.\r\nThese men were to be chosen out of the entire company and should be in\r\nthe flower of their age, abundantly furnished with darts and arms of\r\nevery sort. They were to march against the cacique, and if he refused\r\ntheir alliance, they were to attack and overthrow him. Moreover, the\r\nSpaniards never weary of repeating, as a proof of the wealth they\r\ndream of, that by just scratching the earth almost anywhere, grains of\r\ngold are found. I only repeat here what they have written.\r\n\r\nThe colonists likewise counselled the King to establish a colony at\r\nthe port of Santa Marta in the district called by the natives Saturma.\r\nThis would serve as a place of refuge for people arriving from the\r\nisland of Domingo. From Domingo to this port of Saturma the journey\r\ncould be made in about four or five days, and from Santa Marta to\r\nDarien in three days. This holds good for the voyage thither, but\r\nthe return is much more difficult because of the current we have\r\nmentioned, and which is so strong that the return voyage seems like\r\nclimbing steep mountains. Ships returning from Cuba or Hispaniola to\r\nSpain do not encounter the full force of this current; although they\r\nhave to struggle against a turbulent ocean, still the breadth of the\r\nopen sea is such that the waters have free course. Along the coasts\r\nof Paria, on the contrary, the waters are cramped by the continental\r\nlittoral and the shores of the numerous islands. The same happens in\r\nthe strait of Sicily where a current exists which Your Holiness well\r\nknows, formed by the rocks of Charybdis and Scylla, at a place, where\r\nthe Ionian, Libyan, and Tyrrhenian seas come together within a narrow\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nIn writing of the island of Guanassa and the provinces called Iaia,\r\nMaia, and Cerabarono, Columbus, who first noted the fact, said that\r\nwhile following these coasts and endeavouring to keep to the east,\r\nhis ships encountered such resistance that at times he could not take\r\nsoundings, the adverse current dragging the lead before it touched\r\nbottom. Even with the wind on his stern, he could sometimes make no\r\nmore than one mile in a day. This it is that obliges sailors returning\r\nto Spain to first make for the upper part of Hispaniola or Cuba, and\r\nthen strike out northwards on the high sea in order to profit by the\r\nnorth winds, for they would make no headway sailing in a direct line.\r\nBut we have several times spoken sufficiently about ocean currents. It\r\nis now the moment to report what is written concerning Darien and the\r\ncolony founded on its banks which the colonists have named Santa Maria\r\nAntigua.\r\n\r\nThe site is badly chosen, unhealthy, and more pestiferous than\r\nSardinia. All the colonists look pale, like men sick of the jaundice.\r\nIt is not exclusively the climate of the country which is responsible,\r\nfor in many other places situated in the same latitude the climate is\r\nwholesome and agreeable; clear springs of water break from the earth\r\nand swift rivers flow between banks that are not swampy. The natives,\r\nhowever, make a point of living amongst the hills, instead of in the\r\nvalleys. The colony founded on the shores of Darien is situated in a\r\ndeep valley, completely surrounded by lofty hills, in such wise that\r\nthe direct rays of the sun beat upon it at midday, while as the sun\r\ngoes down its rays are reflected from the mountains, in front, behind,\r\nand all around, rendering the place insupportable. The rays of the sun\r\nare most fierce when they are reflected, rather than direct, nor are\r\nthey themselves pernicious, as may be observed among the snows on high\r\nmountains. Your Holiness is not ignorant of this. For this reason\r\nthe rays of the sun shining upon the mountains reach down, gradually\r\nfalling to their base, just as a large round stone thrown from their\r\nsummit would do. The valleys consequently receive, not only the direct\r\nrays, but also those reflected from the hills and mountains. If,\r\ntherefore, the site of Darien is unhealthy, it is not the fault of\r\nthe country but of the site itself chosen by the colony. The\r\nunwholesomeness of the place is further increased by the malodorous\r\nswamp surrounding it. To say the frank truth, the town is nothing\r\nbut a swamp. When the slaves sprinkle the floor of the houses, toads\r\nspring into existence from the drops of water that fall from their\r\nhands, just as in other places I have seen drops of water changed into\r\nfleas. Wherever a hole one palm deep is dug, water bursts forth; but\r\nit is filthy and contaminated because of the river which flows\r\nthrough a deep valley over a stagnant bed to the sea. The Spaniards,\r\ntherefore, considered changing the site. Necessity had first of all\r\nobliged them to stop there, for the first arrivals were so reduced by\r\nfamine that they did not even think of moving it. Nevertheless they\r\nare tormented in this unfortunate place by the rays of the sun; the\r\nwaters are impure and are pestiferous, the vapours malarious, and\r\nconsequently everybody is ill. There is not even the advantage of a\r\ngood harbour to offset these inconveniences, for the distance from the\r\nvillage to the entrance of the gulf is three leagues, and the road\r\nleading thither is difficult and even painful when it is a question of\r\nbringing provisions from the sea.\r\n\r\nBut let us pass to other details. Hardly had the Spaniards landed when\r\ndivers adventures overtook them. An excellent doctor of Seville, whom\r\nthe authority of the bishop[4] and likewise his desire to obtain gold\r\nprevented from peacefully ending his days in his native country, was\r\nsurprised by a thunderbolt when sleeping quietly with his wife. The\r\nhouse with all its furniture was burnt and the bewildered doctor and\r\nhis wife barely escaped, almost naked and half roasted. Once when\r\na dog eight months old was wandering on the shore, a big crocodile\r\nsnapped him up, like a hawk seizing a chicken as its prey; he\r\nswallowed this miserable dog under the very eyes of all the Spaniards,\r\nwhile the unfortunate animal yelped to his master for help. During the\r\nnight the men were tortured by bats, which bit them; and if one of\r\nthese animals bit a man while he was asleep, he lost his blood, and\r\nwas in danger of losing his life. It is even claimed that some people\r\ndid die on account of these wounds. If these bats find a cock or a hen\r\nat night in the open air, they strike them on their combs and kill\r\nthem. The country is infested by crocodiles, lions, and tigers, but\r\nmeasures have already been taken to kill a large number of them. It is\r\nreported that the skins of lions and tigers killed by the natives are\r\nfound in their cabins. Horses, pigs, and oxen grow rapidly, and become\r\nlarger than their sires. This development is due to the fertility of\r\nthe soil. The reports concerning the size of trees, different products\r\nof the earth, vegetables, and plants we have acclimatised, the deer,\r\nsavage quadrupeds, and the different varieties of fish and birds, are\r\nin accordance with my previous descriptions.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Referring doubtless to Juan de Fonseca bishop of Burgos.]\r\n\r\nThe cacique Careta, ruler of Coiba, was the Spaniards' guest for three\r\ndays. He admired the musical instruments, the trappings of the horses,\r\nand all the things he had never known. He was dismissed with handsome\r\npresents. Careta informed the Spaniards that there grew in his\r\nprovince a tree, of which the wood was suitable for the construction\r\nof ships, since it was never attacked by marine worms. It is known\r\nthat the ships suffered greatly from these pests in the ports of the\r\nNew World. This particular wood is so bitter that the worms do not\r\neven attempt to gnaw into it. There is another tree peculiar to this\r\ncountry whose leaves produce swellings if they touch the naked skin,\r\nand unless sea-water or the saliva of a man who is fasting be not at\r\nonce applied, these blisters produce painful death. This tree also\r\ngrows in Hispaniola. It is claimed that to smell its wood is fatal,\r\nand it cannot be transported anywhere without risk of death. When\r\nthe islanders of Hispaniola sought in vain to shake off the yoke of\r\nservitude, either by open resistance or secret plots, they tried\r\nto smother the Spaniards in their sleep by the smoke of this wood.\r\nAstonished at seeing the wood scattered about them, the Spaniards\r\nforced the wretched natives to confess their plot and punished the\r\nauthors of it. The natives likewise are acquainted with a plant whose\r\nsmell fortifies them, and serves as remedy against the odour of\r\nthis tree, making it possible for them to handle the wood. These\r\nparticulars are futile; and this enough on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards hoped to find still greater riches in the islands of the\r\nSouth Sea. When the courier who brought this news started, Pedro Arias\r\nwas preparing an expedition[5] to an island lying in the midst of the\r\ngulf the Spaniards have named San Miguel, and which Vasco did not\r\ntouch, owing to a rough sea. I have already spoken at length of it in\r\ndescribing the expedition of Vasco to the South Sea. We daily expect\r\nto hear of fresh exploits excelling the former ones, for a number of\r\nother provinces have been conquered, and we sincerely hope that they\r\nwill not prove useless nor devoid of claims to our admiration.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: This expedition under the command of Gaspar Morales was\r\nunsuccessful.]\r\n\r\nJuan Diaz Solis de Nebrissa, whom we have already mentioned, has been\r\nsent to double Cape San Augustin, which belongs to the Portuguese, and\r\nlies seven degrees below the equinoctial line. He should go towards\r\nthe south, below Paria, Cumana, Coquibacoa, and the harbours of\r\nCarthagena, and Santa Marta, in order that our knowledge of the\r\ncontinent may be more precise and extensive. Another commander, Juan\r\nPons, has been sent with three ships to ravage the islands of the\r\nCaribs and reduce to slavery these filthy islanders, who feed on\r\nmen. The other islands in the neighbourhood, which are inhabited by\r\nmild-mannered people, will thus be delivered from this pest and may be\r\nexplored, and the character of their products discovered.\r\n\r\nOther explorers have been sent out in different directions: Gaspar de\r\nBadajoz, towards the west; Francisco Bezarra and Vallejo, the first by\r\nthe extremity of the gulf and the other along the western shore of\r\nits entrance, will seek to lay bare the secrets of that country where\r\nformerly Hojeda sought, under such unhappy circumstances, to settle.\r\nThey will build there a fort and a town. Gaspar de Badajoz, with\r\neighty well-armed men, was the first to leave Darien; Ludovico Mercado\r\nfollowed him with fifty others; Bezarra had eighty men under his\r\norders, and Vallejo seventy. Whether they will succeed or will fall\r\ninto dangerous places, only the providence of the Great Architect\r\nknows. We men are forced to await the occurrence of events before we\r\ncan know them. Let us go on to another subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII\r\n\r\n\r\nPedro Arias, the governor of what is supposed to be a continent, had\r\nhardly left Spain and landed at Darien, with the larger number of his\r\nmen, than I received news of the arrival at Court of Andreas Morales.\r\nThis man, who is a ship's pilot, familiar with these coasts, came on\r\nbusiness. Morales had carefully and attentively explored the land\r\nsupposed to be a continent, as well as the neighbouring islands and\r\nthe interior of Hispaniola. He was commissioned by the brother of\r\nNicholas Ovando, Grand Commander of the Order of Alcantara and\r\ngovernor of the island, to explore Hispaniola. He was chosen because\r\nof his superior knowledge and also because he was better equipped than\r\nothers to fulfil that mission. He has moreover compiled itineraries\r\nand maps, in which everybody who understands the question has\r\nconfidence. Morales came to see me, as all those who come back from\r\nthe ocean habitually do. Let us now examine the heretofore unknown\r\nparticulars I have learned from him and from several others. A\r\ndetailed description of Hispaniola may serve as an introduction to\r\nthis narrative, for is not Hispaniola the capital and the market where\r\nthe most precious gifts of the ocean accumulate?\r\n\r\nRound about the island lie a thousand and more Nereid nymphs, fair,\r\ngraceful, and elegant, serving as its ornaments like to another\r\nTethys, their queen and their mother. By Nereids I mean to say the\r\nislands scattered round about Hispaniola, concerning which we shall\r\ngive some brief information. Afterwards will come the island of pearls\r\nwhich our compatriots call Rico, and which lies in the gulf of San\r\nMiguel in the South Sea. It has already been explored and marvellous\r\nthings found; and yet more wonderful are promised for the future, for\r\nits brilliant pearls are worthy to figure in the necklaces, bracelets,\r\nand crown of a Cleopatra. It will not be out of place at the close\r\nof this narrative to say something of the shells which produce these\r\npearls. Let us now come to this elysian Hispaniola, and begin by\r\nexplaining its name; after which we will describe its conformation,\r\nits harbours, climate, and conclude by the divisions of its territory.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken in our First Decade of the island of Mataninó, a word\r\npronounced with the accent on the last syllable. Not to return too\r\noften to the same subject, Your Holiness will note the accent marking\r\nall these native words is placed where it should fall. It is claimed\r\nthat the first inhabitants of Hispaniola were islanders of Mataninó,\r\nwho had been driven from that country by hostile factions and had\r\narrived there in their canoes dug out of a single tree-trunk, by which\r\nI mean to say their barques. Thus did Dardanus arrive from Corythus\r\nand Teucer from Crete, in Asia, in the region later called the\r\nTrojade. Thus did the Tyrians and the Sidonians, under the leadership\r\nof the fabulous Dido, reach the coasts of Africa. The people of\r\nMataninó, expelled from their homes, established themselves in that\r\npart of the island of Hispaniola called Cahonao, upon the banks of a\r\nriver called Bahaboni. In like manner we read in Roman history that\r\nthe Trojan Æneas, after he arrived in Italy, established himself on\r\nthe banks of the Latin Tiber. There lies across the mouth of the river\r\nBahaboni an island where, according to tradition, these immigrants\r\nbuilt their first house, calling it Camoteia. This place was\r\nconsecrated and henceforth regarded with great veneration. Until the\r\narrival of the Spaniards the natives rendered it the homage of their\r\ncontinual gifts; the same as we do Jerusalem, the cradle of our\r\nreligion; or the Turks, Mecca, or the ancient inhabitants of the\r\nFortunate Isles venerated the summit of a high rock on the Grand\r\nCanary. Many of these latter, singing joyous canticles, threw\r\nthemselves down from the summit of this rock, for their false priests\r\nhad persuaded them that the souls of those who threw themselves from\r\nthe rock for the love of Tirana, were blessed, and destined to an\r\neternity of delight. The conquerors of the Fortunate Isles have found\r\nthat practice still in use in our own time, for the remembrance of\r\nthese sacrifices is preserved in the common language, and the rock\r\nitself keeps its name. I have, moreover, recently learned that\r\nthere still exists in those islands since their colonisation by the\r\nFrenchman Bethencourt under the authorisation of the King of Castile,\r\na group of Bethencourt's people, who still use the French language and\r\ncustoms. Nevertheless, his heirs, as I have above stated, sold the\r\nisland to the Castilians, but the colonists who came with Bethencourt\r\nbuilt houses in the archipelago and prosperously maintained their\r\nfamilies. They still live there mixed with Spaniards and consider\r\nthemselves fortunate to be no longer exposed to the rigours of the\r\nFrench climate.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the people at Mataninó. Hispaniola was first\r\ncalled by its early inhabitants Quizqueia, and afterwards Haiti.\r\nThese names were not chosen at random, but were derived from natural\r\nfeatures, for Quizqueia in their language means \"something large\" or\r\nlarger than anything, and is a synonym for universality, the whole;\r\nsomething in the sense that [Greek: pan] was used among the Greeks.\r\nThe islanders really believed that the island, being so great,\r\ncomprised the entire universe, and that the sun warmed no other land\r\nthan theirs and the neighbouring islands. Thus they decided to call it\r\nQuizqueia. The name Haiti[1] in their language means _altitude_, and\r\nbecause it describes a part, was given to the entire island. The\r\ncountry rises in many places into lofty mountain-ranges, is covered\r\nwith dense forests, or broken into profound valleys which, because of\r\nthe height of the mountains, are gloomy; everywhere else it is very\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: Meaning in the Caribs' language _mountainous_. Columbus,\r\nas we have mentioned, named the island Hispaniola, and it is so called\r\nin early American history; but since 1803, the native name of Haiti or\r\nHayti has been applied both to the entire island, and to one of the\r\ntwo states into which it is divided, the other state being called\r\nSanto Domingo.]\r\n\r\nPermit at this point, Most Holy Father, a digression. Your Beatitude\r\nwill no doubt ask with astonishment how it comes that such uncivilised\r\nmen, destitute of any knowledge of letters, have preserved for such\r\na long time the tradition of their origin. This has been possible\r\nbecause from the earliest times, and chiefly in the houses of the\r\ncaciques; the bovites, that is to say the wise men, have trained the\r\nsons of the caciques, teaching them their past history by heart. In\r\nimparting their teaching they carefully distinguish two classes of\r\nstudies; the first is of a general interest, having to do with the\r\nsuccession of events; the second is of a particular interest, treating\r\nof the notable deeds accomplished in time of peace or time of war\r\nby their fathers, grandfathers, great-grandfathers, and all their\r\nancestors. Each one of these exploits is commemorated in poems written\r\nin their language. These poems are called _arreytos_. As with us the\r\nguitar player, so with them the drummers accompany these arreytos and\r\nlead singing choirs. Their drums are called _maguay_. Some of the\r\narreytos are love songs, others are elegies, and others are war songs;\r\nand each is sung to an appropriate air. They also love to dance, but\r\nthey are more agile than we are; first, because nothing pleases\r\nthem better than dancing and, secondly, because they are naked, and\r\nuntrammelled by clothing. Some of the arreytos composed by their\r\nancestors predicted our arrival, and these poems resembling elegies\r\nlament their ruin. \"Magnacochios [clothed men] shall disembark in the\r\nisland armed with swords and with one stroke cut a man in two, and our\r\ndescendants shall bend beneath their yoke.\"\r\n\r\nI really am not very much astonished that their ancestors predicted\r\nthe slavery of their descendants, if everything told concerning their\r\nfamiliar relations with devils is true. I discussed this subject at\r\nlength in the ninth book of my First Decade, when treating of the\r\nzemes, that is to say the idols they worship. Since their zemes have\r\nbeen taken away the natives admit they no longer see spectres; and our\r\ncompatriots believe this is due to the sign of the cross, with which\r\nthey are all armed when washed in the waters of baptism.\r\n\r\nAll the islanders attach great importance to know the frontiers and\r\nlimits of the different tribes. It is generally the _mitaines_, that\r\nis to say nobles, as they are called, who attend to this duty, and\r\nthey are very skilful in measuring their properties and estates. The\r\npeople have no other occupation than sowing and harvesting. They are\r\nskillful fishermen, and every day during the whole year they dive into\r\nthe streams, passing as much time in the water as on land. They are\r\nnot neglectful, however, of hunting, they have, as we have already\r\nsaid, utias, which resemble small rabbits, and iguana serpents, which\r\nI described in my First Decade. These latter resemble crocodiles\r\nand are eight feet long, living on land and having a good flavour.\r\nInnumerable birds are found in all the islands: pigeons, ducks, geese,\r\nand herons. The parrots are as plentiful here as sparrows amongst us.\r\nEach cacique assigns different occupations to his different subjects,\r\nsome being sent hunting, others to fish, others to cultivate the\r\nfields. But let us return to the names.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that Quizqueia and Haiti are the ancient names of\r\nthe island. Some natives also call the island Cipangu, from the name\r\nof a mountain range rich in gold. In like manner our poets have called\r\nItaly _Latium_, after one of its provinces, and our ancestors also\r\ncalled Italy _Ausonia_ and _Hesperia_, just as these islanders have\r\ngiven the names Quizqueia, Haiti, and Cipangu to their country. In the\r\nbeginning the Spaniards called the island Isabella after the Queen\r\nIsabella, taking this name from the first colony they founded there.\r\nI have already spoken sufficiently of this in my First Decade. They\r\nafterwards called it Hispaniola, a diminutive of Hispania. This is\r\nenough concerning names; let us now pass to the conformation of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThe first explorers of the island have described it to me as\r\nresembling in form a chestnut leaf, split by a gulf on the western\r\nside opposite the island of Cuba; but the captain, Andreas Morales,\r\nnow gives me another and somewhat different description. He represents\r\nthe island as being cut into, at the eastern and western extremities,\r\nby large gulfs,[2] having far extending points of land. He indicates\r\nlarge and secure harbours in the gulf facing eastwards. I will see\r\nto it that some day a copy of this map of Hispaniola be sent to Your\r\nHoliness, for Morales has drawn it in the same form as those of Spain\r\nand Italy, which Your Holiness has often examined, showing their\r\nmountains, valleys, rivers, towns, and colonies. Let us boldly compare\r\nHispaniola to Italy, formerly the mistress of the universe. In point\r\nof size Hispaniola is a trifle smaller than Italy. According to the\r\nstatements of recent explorers, it extends five hundred and forty\r\nmiles from east to west. As we have already noticed in our First\r\nDecade, the Admiral had exaggerated its length. In certain places the\r\nwidth of Hispaniola extends to three hundred miles. It is narrower at\r\nthe point where the land is prolonged in promontories, but it is much\r\nmore favoured than Italy for, throughout the greatest part of its\r\nextent, it enjoys such an agreeable climate that neither the rigours\r\nof cold nor excessive heats are known.[3] The two solstices are about\r\nequal to the equinoxes. There is only one hour of difference between\r\nday and night, according as one lives on the southern or the northern\r\ncoast of the island.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: On the east is the gulf or bay of Samana, on the west\r\nthat of Gonaires.]\r\n\r\n[Note 3: The superficial area of Haiti is 77,255 square\r\nkilometres. The climatic conditions no longer correspond to Peter\r\nMartyr's descriptions, as there are four seasons, recognised, two\r\nrainy and two dry. In the upland, the temperature is invigorating and\r\nwholesome.]\r\n\r\nIn several parts of the island, however, cold does prevail; Your\r\nHoliness will understand that this is due to the position of the\r\nmountain ranges, as I shall later demonstrate. The cold, however, is\r\nnever sufficiently severe to inconvenience the islanders with snow.\r\nPerpetual spring and perpetual autumn prevail in this fortunate\r\nisland. During the entire year the trees are covered with leaves,\r\nand the prairies with grass. Everything in Hispaniola grows in an\r\nextraordinary fashion. I have already related elsewhere that the\r\nvegetables, such as cabbages, lettuces, salads, radishes, and other\r\nsimilar plants, ripen within sixteen days, while pumpkins, melons,\r\ncucumbers, etc., require but thirty days. We have also stated that\r\nanimals brought from Spain, such as oxen, attain a greater size. When\r\ndescribing the growth of these animals, it is claimed that the oxen\r\nresemble elephants and the pigs, mules; but this is an exaggeration.\r\nPork has an agreeable taste and is wholesome, because the pigs feed\r\nupon mirobolanes and other island fruits, which grow wild in the\r\nforests, just as in Europe they eat beech nuts, ilex berries, and\r\nacorns. Grape-vines also grow in an extraordinary fashion, despite\r\nthe absence of all attention. If any one chooses to sow wheat in a\r\nmountain region exposed to the cold, it flourishes wonderfully,\r\nbut less so in the plain, because the soil is too fertile. To one\r\nunheard-of-thing people have certified upon oath; that the ears are as\r\nthick round as a man's arm and one palm in length, and that some of\r\nthem contain as many as a thousand grains of wheat. The best bread\r\nfound in the island is that made from the yucca, and is called cazabi.\r\nIt is most digestible, and the yucca is cultivated and harvested in\r\nthe greatest abundance and with great facility. Whatever free time\r\nafterwards remains, is employed in seeking gold.\r\n\r\nThe quadrupeds are so numerous that already the exportation to Spain\r\nof horses and other animals and of hides has begun; thus the daughter\r\ngives assistance in many things to the mother. I have already\r\nelsewhere given particulars concerning red wood, mastic, perfumes,\r\ngreen colouring material, cotton, amber, and many other products of\r\nthis island. What greater happiness could one wish in this world than\r\nto live in a country where such wonders are to be seen and enjoyed?\r\nIs there a more agreeable existence than that one leads in a country\r\nwhere one is not forced to shut himself in narrow rooms to escape cold\r\nthat chills or heat that suffocates? A land where it is not necessary\r\nto load the body with heavy clothing in winter, or to toast one's legs\r\nat a continual fire, a practice which ages people in the twinkling\r\nof the eye, exhausts their force, and provokes a thousand different\r\nmaladies. The air of Hispaniola is stated to be salubrious, and the\r\nrivers which flow over beds of gold, wholesome. There are indeed no\r\nrivers nor mountains nor very few valleys where gold is not found.\r\nLet us close now with a brief description of the interior of this\r\nfortunate island.\r\n\r\nHispaniola possesses four rivers, each flowing from mountain sources\r\nand dividing the island into four almost equal parts. One of these\r\nstreams, the Iunna, flows east. Another, the Attibunicus, west; the\r\nthird, the Naiba, south, and the fourth, the Iaccha, north. We have\r\nalready related that Morales proposes a new division, by which the\r\nisland would be divided into five districts. We shall give to each of\r\nthese little states its ancient name and shall enumerate whatever is\r\nworthy of note in each of them.\r\n\r\nThe most eastern district of the island belongs to the province of\r\nCaizcimu, and is thus called because _cimu_ means in their language\r\nthe _front_ or beginning of anything. Next come the provinces of\r\nHuhabo and Cahibo; the fourth is Bainoa, and the extreme western part\r\nbelongs to the province of Guaccaiarima; but that of Bainoa is larger\r\nthan the three preceding ones. Caizcimu extends from the point of the\r\nisland as far as the river Hozama, which flows by Santo Domingo, the\r\ncapital. Its northern border is marked by precipitous mountains,[4]\r\nwhich on account of their steepness especially bear the name of Haiti.\r\nThe province of Huhabo lies between the mountains of Haiti and the\r\nIacaga River. The third province Cahibo, includes all the country\r\nlying between the Cubaho and the Dahazio rivers as far as the mouth of\r\nIaccha, one of the rivers dividing the islands into four equal parts.\r\nThis province extends to the Cibao Mountains, where much gold is\r\nfound. In these mountains rises the River Demahus. The province also\r\nextends to the sources of the Naiba River, the third of the four\r\nstreams and the one which flows south, towards the other bank of the\r\nSanto Domingo River.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: Now called Sierra de Monte Cristo, of which the loftiest\r\npeak, Toma Diego Campo, is 1220 metres high.]\r\n\r\nBainoa begins at the frontier of Cahibo, and extends as far as the\r\nisland of Cahini, almost touching the north coast of Hispaniola at the\r\nplace where the colony was once founded. The remainder of the island\r\nalong the west coast forms the province of Guaccaiarima, thus called\r\nbecause it is the extremity of the island. The word _Iarima_ means a\r\nflea. Guaccaiarima means, therefore, the flea of the island; _Gua_\r\nbeing the article in their language. There are very few of their\r\nnames, particularly those of kings which do not begin with this\r\narticle _gua_., such as Guarionex and Guaccanarillus; and the same\r\napplies to many names of places.\r\n\r\nThe districts or cantons of Caizcimu are Higuey, Guanama, Reyre,\r\nXagua, Aramana, Arabo, Hazoa, Macorix, Caicoa, Guiagua, Baguanimabo,\r\nand the rugged mountains of Haiti. Let us remark in this connection\r\nthat there are no aspirates pronounced in Hispaniola, as amongst the\r\nLatin peoples. In the first place, in all their words the aspirate\r\nproduces the effect of a consonant, and is more prolonged than the\r\nconsonant _f_, amongst us. Nor is it pronounced by pressing the under\r\nlip against the upper teeth. On the contrary the mouth is opened wide,\r\n_ha, he, hi, ho, hu_. I know that the Jews and the Arabs pronounce\r\ntheir aspirates in the same way, and the Spaniards do likewise with\r\nwords they have taken from the Arabs who were for a long time their\r\nmasters. These words are sufficiently numerous; _almohada_ = a\r\npillow; _almohaza_ = a horse-comb, and other similar words, which are\r\npronounced by holding the breath. I insist upon this point because\r\nit often happens among the Latins that an aspirate changes the\r\nsignificance of a word; thus _hora_ means a division of the day, _ora_\r\nwhich is the plural of _os_, the mouth, and _ora_ meaning region, as\r\nin the phrase _Trojae qui primus ab oris_. The sense changes according\r\nto the accent: _occ[=i]do_ and _occ[)i]do_. It is consequently\r\nnecessary to heed the accents and not neglect the aspirate in speaking\r\nthe language of these simple people. I have spoken above about the\r\naccent and the article _gua_.\r\n\r\n[Note: [=i] is a long 'i', and [)i] is a short 'i'.]\r\n\r\nThe cantons of the province of Hubabo are Xamana, Canabaco, Cubao, and\r\nothers whose names I do not know. The cantons of Magua and Cacacubana\r\nbelong to the province of Cahibo. The natives in this province\r\nspeak an entirely different language from that spoken by the other\r\nislanders; they are called Macoryzes. In the canton of Cubana another\r\nlanguage resembling none of the others is spoken; it is likewise used\r\nin the canton of Baiohaigua. The other cantons of Cahibo are Dahaboon,\r\nCybaho, Manabaho, Cotoy, the last being situated in the centre of the\r\nisland and traversed by the Nizaus River, and finally the mountains\r\nMahaitin, Hazua, and Neibaymao.\r\n\r\nBainoa, the fourth province has the following dependent cantons:\r\nMaguana, Iagohaiucho, Bauruco, Dabaigua, and Attibuni which takes this\r\nname from the river; Caunoa, Buiaz, Dahibonici, Maiaguarite, Atiec,\r\nMaccazina, Guahabba, Anninici, Marien, Guarricco, Amaquei, Xaragua,\r\nYaguana, Azzuei, Iacchi, Honorucco, Diaguo, Camaie, Neibaimao. In the\r\nlast province, Guaccaiarima, lie the cantons of Navicarao, Guabaqua,\r\nTaquenazabo, Nimaca, Little Bainoa, Cahaymi, Ianaizi, Manabaxao,\r\nZavana, Habacoa, and Ayqueroa.\r\n\r\nLet us now give some particulars concerning the cantons themselves:\r\nthe first gulf[5] found in the province of Caizcimu cuts into a rock\r\nwhere it has worn an immense cave situated at the foot of a lofty\r\nmountain about two stadia from the sea. Its vast arched entrance\r\nresembles the gates of a great temple. In obedience to an order from\r\nthe government, Morales tried to enter this cavern with the ships.\r\nSeveral streams come together there through unknown channels, as in\r\na drain. It used to be a mystery what became of a number of rivers\r\nninety miles long, which suddenly disappeared under the earth never to\r\nbe seen again. It is thought they are in some fashion swallowed up in\r\nthe depths of the rocky mountain, continuing their underground course\r\ntill they reach this cavern. Having succeeded in entering the cave,\r\nMorales was very nearly drowned. He reports that inside there are\r\nwhirlpools and currents in incessant conflict, upon which his barque\r\nwas tossed to and fro like a ball, amidst the horrible roar of the\r\nwhirlpools and currents around him. He regretted having come, but\r\ncould find no way to get out. He and his companions drifted about in\r\nthe obscurity, not only because of the darkness prevailing in the\r\ncavern, which extends into the depths of the mountains, but also\r\nbecause of the perpetual mist rising from the constantly agitated\r\nwaters, and resolving itself into damp vapours. Morales compared the\r\nnoise of these waters to that of the falls of the Nile where it pours\r\nforth from the mountains of Ethiopia. Both he and his companions\r\nwere so deafened they could not hear one another speak. He finally\r\nsucceeded in finding the exit, and emerged from the cavern, trembling,\r\nfeeling that he had left the infernal regions and returned to the\r\nupper world.[6]\r\n\r\n[Note 5: The gulf of Samana; its extent is 1300 square\r\nkilometres.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6: _Evasit tandem pavidus de antro, veluti de Tartaro,\r\nputans rediisse ad superos_.]\r\n\r\nAbout sixty miles from Santo Domingo the capital, the horizon is shut\r\nin by lofty mountains, upon whose summit lies an inaccessible lake, to\r\nwhich no road leads. None of the colonists have visited it because of\r\nthe steepness of the mountain. In obedience to the governor's orders\r\nMorales, taking a neighbouring cacique for his guide, ascended the\r\nmountain and found the lake. He reports that it was very cold there\r\nand, as a proof of the low temperature, he brought back some ferns and\r\nbrambles, plants which do not grow in warm countries. The mountains\r\nare called Ymizui Hybahaino. The waters of the lake, which is three\r\nmiles in circumference, are full of various kinds of fish. It is fed\r\nby several streams, and has no outlet, for it is surrounded on all\r\nsides by lofty peaks.\r\n\r\nLet us now say a few words about another, Caspian or Hyrcanian sea (by\r\nwhich I mean a sea surrounded by land), and other fresh-water lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe province of Bainoa, which is three times the size of the three\r\nprovinces of Caizcimu, Huhabo, and Caihabon, embraces the valley of\r\nCaionani, in the midst of which there is a salt lake[1] of bitter,\r\ndistasteful water, similar to what we read of the Caspian Sea. I will\r\ntherefore call it Caspian, although it is not in Hyrcania. There are\r\ndepths in this lake from which the salty waters pour forth and are\r\nabsorbed in the mountains. These caverns are supposed to be so vast\r\nand so deep that even the largest sea-fish pass through them into the\r\nlake.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: The lagune of Enriquillo on the plains of Neyba.]\r\n\r\nAmongst these fish is the shark, which cuts a man in two with one bite\r\nand swallows him. These sharks come up from the sea by the Hozama\r\nRiver which flows past the capital of the island. They devour numbers\r\nof natives, since nothing will prevent the latter from bathing and\r\nwashing themselves in the river. Many streams flow into the lake; the\r\nGuaninicabon, which flows from the north, is salt; the Haccoce flows\r\nfrom the south, the Guannabi from the east, and the Occoa from the\r\nwest. These are the most important of the rivers and are always full.\r\nBesides them, a score of smaller ones also fall into this Caspian Sea.\r\nNot more than a stadium distant and on its northern shore are about\r\ntwo hundred springs, arranged in the form of a circle, from which\r\nfresh, potable water gushes forth, forming an impassable stream, which\r\nmingles with the others in the lake.\r\n\r\nThe cacique of that country finding his wife at prayer one day in\r\na chapel built by the Christians in his territory, wished to have\r\nintercourse with her; but the wife, alleging the holiness of the spot\r\nrefused, speaking as follows, _Tei toca, tei toca_, which means \"Be\r\nquiet\"; _Techeta cynato guamechyna_ which signifies \"God would be\r\ndispleased.\" The cacique was very much vexed by this _Techeta cynato\r\nguamechyna_, and with a menacing gesture of his arm said, _Guayva_,\r\nwhich means \"Get out,\" _Cynato machabucha guamechyna_, meaning, \"What\r\nmatters to me the anger of your God?\" With which he overpowered his\r\nwife, but was struck dumb on the spot and half lost the use of his\r\narm. Impressed by this miracle and overcome with repentance, he lived\r\nthe rest of his life as a religious, and would not allow the chapel to\r\nbe swept or decorated by other hands than his own. This miracle made a\r\ngreat impression upon many of the natives and upon all the Christians,\r\nand the chapel was frequented and respected by them. As for the\r\ncacique, he submissively endured without complaint the punishment for\r\nhis insult. But let us return to the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\nThis salt lake is swept by hurricanes and storms, so that the\r\nfishermen's boats are often in danger and frequently sink with all\r\non board. Nor has any drowned body ever been found floating upon the\r\nwaters or thrown upon the shore, as happens with those engulfed by\r\nthe sea. These storms provide generous banquets for the sharks. The\r\nnatives call this Caspian Sea, Haguygabon. In the midst of it lies\r\na sterile island called Guarizacca, which serves as a refuge for\r\nfishermen. The lake is thirty miles long and twelve or, perhaps, even\r\nfifteen broad.\r\n\r\nAnother lake lies in the same plain and quite near to the former, of\r\nwhich the waters are bitter-sweet,[2] that is to say they are not\r\npleasant to drink, but may be drunk in case of absolute necessity. It\r\nis twenty-five miles long by nine or ten broad, and is fed by a number\r\nof rivers. It has no outlet, and the water from the sea also reaches\r\nit, though in a small quantity; this accounts for its brackish waters.\r\nThe third fresh-water lake, called Painagua, exists in the same\r\nprovince. It lies not very far to the west of the Caspian Sea. North\r\nof this same Caspian lies a fourth lake, of small importance, since it\r\nmeasures but four miles in length and a little more than one in width;\r\nit is called Guacca, and its waters are potable. South of the Caspian\r\na fifth lake, called Babbareo is found; it is almost circular and\r\nabout three miles in length. Its waters are fresh like those of the\r\nother two. As it has no outlet and its waters are not sucked down\r\ninto caverns, it overflows its banks when swollen by torrents. Lake\r\nBabbareo lies in the Zamana district of the province of Bainoa. There\r\nis still another lake called Guanyban, near by and south-west of the\r\nCaspian; it is ten miles long and nearly round. Throughout the island\r\nare numerous other small lakes, which we do not mention for fear\r\nof being tiresome by too much insistence on the same subject.\r\nNevertheless there is one more particular concerning the lakes and\r\nthis is the last: All of them are full of fish, and support many\r\nbirds. They are situated in an immense valley which extends from east\r\nto west for a distance of one hundred and twenty miles and a breadth,\r\nat the narrowest point of eighteen and at the broadest, of twenty-five\r\nmiles. As one looks west the mountain chain of Duiguni borders this\r\nvalley on the left, and on the right rises the range of Caigun, which\r\ngives its name to the valley at its base. Upon the northern slope\r\nbegins another valley larger than the former, for it extends a\r\ndistance of two hundred miles and a breadth of thirty miles at the\r\nbroadest, and twenty miles at the narrowest part. This valley is\r\ncalled Maguana and sometimes Iguaniu or Hathathiei. Since we have\r\nmentioned this part of the valley called Atici, we must make a\r\ndigression to introduce a miraculous sea fish.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: _Lago de Fondo ... aquarum salsodulcium_...]\r\n\r\nA certain cacique of the region, Caramatexius by name, was very fond\r\nof fishing. Upon one occasion a young fish of the gigantic species\r\ncalled by the natives _manati_ was caught in his nets. I think this\r\nspecies of monster in unknown in our seas. It is shaped like a turtle\r\nand has four feet, but is covered with scales instead of shell.\r\nIts skin is so tough that it fears nothing from arrows, for it is\r\nprotected by a thousand points. This amphibious creature has a smooth\r\nback, a head resembling that of a bull, and is tame rather than\r\nfierce. Like the elephant or the dolphin, it likes the companionship\r\nof men and is very intelligent. The cacique fed this young fish for\r\nseveral days with yucca bread, millet, and the roots the natives eat.\r\nWhile it was still young, he put it in a lake near to his house, as in\r\na fish-pond. This lake, which had been called Guaurabo. was henceforth\r\ncalled Manati. For twenty-five years this fish lived at liberty in the\r\nwaters of the lake, and grew to an extraordinary size. All that has\r\nbeen told about the lake of Baiæ or the dolphins of Arion is not to be\r\ncompared with the stories of this fish. They gave it the name of Matu,\r\nmeaning generous or noble, and whenever one of the king's attendants,\r\nspecially known by him, called from the bank Matu, Matu, the fish,\r\nremembering favours received, raised its head and came towards the\r\nshore to eat from the man's hand. Anyone who wished to cross the lake\r\nmerely made a sign and the fish advanced to receive him on its back.\r\nOne day it carried ten men altogether on its back, transporting\r\nthem safely, while they sang and played musical instruments. If it\r\nperceived a Christian when it raised its head it dived under water and\r\nrefused to obey. This was because it had once been beaten by a\r\npeevish young Christian, who threw a sharp dart at this amiable and\r\ndomesticated fish. The dart did it no harm because of the thickness\r\nof its skin, which is all rough and covered with points, but the fish\r\nnever forgot the attack, and from that day forth every time it heard\r\nits name called, it first looked carefully about to see if it beheld\r\nanybody dressed like the Christians. It loved to play upon the bank\r\nwith the servants of the cacique, and especially with the young son\r\nwho was in the habit of feeding it. It was more amusing than a monkey.\r\nThis manati was for long a joy to the whole island, and many natives\r\nand Christians daily visited this animal.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the flesh of manatis is of good flavour, and they are\r\nfound in great numbers in the waters of the island. The manati Matu\r\nfinally disappeared. It was carried out to sea by the Attibunico, one\r\nof the four rivers which divide the island into equal parts, during an\r\ninundation accompanied by horrible typhoons which the islanders call\r\nhurricanes. The Attibunico overflowed its banks and inundated the\r\nentire valley, mingling its waters with those of all the lakes. The\r\ngood, clever, sociable Matu, following the tide of the torrent,\r\nrejoined its former mother and the waters of its birth; it has never\r\nsince been seen. But enough of this digression.\r\n\r\nLet us now describe this valley. The valley of Atici is bordered by\r\nthe Cibao and Cayguana Mountains, which enclose it in a southerly\r\ndirection to the sea. Beyond the mountains of Cibao towards the north\r\nthere opens another valley called the Guarionexius, because it has\r\nalways belonged, from father to son and by hereditary right, to the\r\ncaciques called Guarionexius. I have already spoken at length about\r\nthis cacique in my first writings on Hispaniola and in my First\r\nDecade. This valley is one hundred and ninety miles long from east to\r\nwest, and between thirty and fifty miles broad at its widest part. It\r\nbegins at the district of Canabocoa, crosses the provinces of Huhabo\r\nand Cahibo, and ends in the province of Bainoa and in the district of\r\nMariena. Along its borders extend the mountains of Cibao, Cahanao,\r\nCazacubana. There is not a province or a district in it which is not\r\nnoteworthy for the majesty of its mountains, the fertility of its\r\nvalleys, the forests upon its hills, or the number of rivers watering\r\nit. Upon the slopes of all the mountains and hills, and in the river\r\nbeds, gold in abundance is found; and in the latter, fish of delicious\r\nflavour; only one is to be excepted, which from its source in the\r\nmountains to the sea is perpetually salt. This river is called Bahaun,\r\nand flows through Maguana, a district of the province of Bainoa. It\r\nis thought that this river passes through chalk and saline strata, of\r\nwhich there are many in the island, and of which I shall later speak\r\nmore fully.\r\n\r\nWe have noted that Hispaniola may be divided into four or five parts,\r\nby rivers or by provinces. Still another division may be made; the\r\nentire island might be divided by the four mountain chains which cut\r\nit in two from east to west. Everywhere there is wealth, and gold is\r\neverywhere found. From the caverns and gorges of these mountains pour\r\nforth all the streams which traverse the island. There are frightful\r\ncaves, dark valleys, and arid rocks, but no dangerous animal has ever\r\nbeen found; neither lion, nor bear, nor fierce tiger, nor crafty fox,\r\nnor savage wolf. Everything thereabouts speaks of happiness and will\r\ndo so still more, Most Holy Father, when all these thousands of people\r\nshall be gathered among the sheep of your flock, and those devil\r\nimages, the zemes, shall have been banished.\r\n\r\nYou must not be vexed, Most Holy Father, if from time to time in the\r\ncourse of my narrative I repeat certain particulars, or allow myself\r\nsome digressions. I feel myself carried away by a sort of joyous\r\nmental excitement, a kind of Delphic or Sibylline breath, when I read\r\nof these things; and I am, as it were, forced to repeat the same fact,\r\nespecially when I realise to what an extent the propagation of our\r\nreligion is involved. Yet amidst all these marvels and fertility,\r\nthere is one point which causes me small satisfaction; these simple,\r\nnaked natives were little accustomed to labour, and the immense\r\nfatigues they now suffer, labouring in the mines, is killing them in\r\ngreat numbers and reducing the others to such a state of despair that\r\nmany kill themselves, or refuse to procreate their kind. It is alleged\r\nthat the pregnant women take drugs to produce abortion, knowing that\r\nthe children they bear will become the slaves of the Christians.\r\nAlthough a royal decree has declared all the islanders to be free,\r\nthey are forced to work more than is fit for free men. The number of\r\nthese unfortunate people diminishes in an extraordinary fashion. Many\r\npeople claim that they formerly numbered more than twelve millions;\r\nhow many there are to-day I will not venture to say, so much am I\r\nhorrified.[3] Let us finish with this sad subject and return to the\r\ncharms of this admirable Hispaniola.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: The _Brevissima Relacion de la Destruycion de las\r\nIndias_, of Fray B. de las Casas, contains the most crushing\r\nindictment of Spanish colonial government ever penned. When every\r\nallowance has been made for the apostolic, or even the fanatical\r\nzeal, with which Las Casas defended his protégés and denounced their\r\ntormentors, the case against the Spanish colonists remains one of the\r\nblackest known to history. Just what the native population of Haiti\r\nand Cuba originally numbered is hardly ascertainable; twelve millions\r\nis doubtless an excessive estimate; but within twenty-five years\r\nof the discovery of America, the islanders were reduced to 14,000.\r\nBetween 1507 and 1513 their numbers fell from 14,000 to 4000, and\r\nby 1750 not one remained. Consult Fabié, _Vida y Escritos de Fray\r\nBartolomé de Las Casas_ (Madrid, 1879); MacNutt, _Bartholomew de las\r\nCasas, his Life, his Apostolate, and his Writings_, New York, 1910.]\r\n\r\nIn the mountains of Cibao, which are situated in about the centre of\r\nthe island, and in the province of Cahibo where we have said the most\r\ngold was found, there lies a district called Cotohi. It is amongst the\r\nclouds, completely enclosed by mountain chains, and its inhabitants\r\nare numerous. It consists of a large plateau twenty-five miles in\r\nlength and fifteen in breadth; and this plateau lies so high above the\r\nother mountains that the peaks surrounding it appear to give birth to\r\nthe lesser mountains. Four seasons may be counted on this plateau:\r\nspring, summer, autumn, and winter; and the plants there wither, the\r\ntrees lose their leaves and the fields dry up. This does not happen\r\nin the rest of the island, which only knows spring-time and autumn.\r\nFerns, grass, and berry bushes grow there, furnishing undeniable proof\r\nof the cold temperature. Nevertheless the country is agreeable and the\r\ncold is not severe, for the natives do not suffer from it, nor are\r\nthere snow storms., As a proof of the fertility of the soil it is\r\nalleged that the stalks of the ferns are thicker than javelins. The\r\nneighbouring mountainsides contain rich gold deposits but these\r\nmines will not be exploited because of the cold, which would make it\r\nnecessary to give clothing even to those miners who are accustomed to\r\nthat labour.\r\n\r\nThe natives are satisfied with very little; they are delicate and\r\ncould not endure winter, for they live in the open air. Two rivers\r\ntraverse this region, flowing from the high mountains which border it.\r\nThe first, called Comoiaixa, flows towards the west and loses its name\r\nwhere it empties into the Naiba. The second, called the Tirechetus,\r\nflows east and empties into the Iunna.\r\n\r\nWhen I passed the island of Crete on my journey to the Sultan,[4] the\r\nVenetians told me that there was a similar region on the summit of\r\nMount Ida; this region, more than the rest of the island, produces\r\na better wheat crop. Protected by the impassable roads which led to\r\nthese heights, the Cretans revolted, and for a long time maintained an\r\narmed independence against the Senate of Venice. Finally, when weary\r\nof fighting, they decided to submit, and the Senate decreed their\r\ncountry should remain a desert. All avenues leading to it were guarded\r\nso that no one could go there without its consent.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: _De Legatione Babylonica_.]\r\n\r\nIt was in that same year, 1502, that the Venetians again permitted\r\nthis district to be cultivated, but by labourers incapable of using\r\narms.\r\n\r\nThere is a district in Hispaniola called Cotoy, lying between the\r\nprovinces of Huhabo and Cahibo. It is a sterile country having\r\nmountains, valleys, and plains, and is sparsely inhabited. Gold is\r\nfound there in quantities, but instead of being in the form of ingots\r\nor grains, it is in solid masses of pure metal, deposited in beds of\r\nsoft stone in the crevices of the rocks. The veins are discovered by\r\nbreaking the rocks, and one such may be compared to a living tree, as\r\nfrom its root or starting-point it sends forth branches through the\r\nsoft pores and open passages, right up to the summit of the mountains,\r\nnever stopping till it reaches the surface of the earth. Bathed in the\r\nsplendour of the atmosphere it brings forth its fruit, consisting of\r\ngrains and nuggets. These grains and nuggets are afterwards washed\r\naway by the heavy rains and swept down the mountain, like all heavy\r\nbodies, to be disseminated throughout the entire island. It is thought\r\nthe metal is not produced at the place where it is found, especially\r\nif that be in the open or in the river beds. The root of the golden\r\ntree seems always to reach down towards the centre of the earth,\r\ngrowing always larger; for the deeper one digs in the bowels of the\r\nmountain the larger are the grains of gold unearthed. The branches\r\nof the golden tree are in some places as slender as a thread, while\r\nothers are as thick as a finger, according to the dimensions of the\r\ncrevices. It sometimes happens that pockets full of gold are found;\r\nthese being the crevices through which the branches of the golden tree\r\npass. When these pockets are filled with the output from the trunk,\r\nthe branch pushes on in search of another outlet towards the earth's\r\nsurface. It is often stopped by the solid rock, but in other fissures\r\nit seems, in a manner, to be fed from the vitality of the roots.\r\n\r\nYou will ask me, Most Holy Father, what quantity of gold is produced\r\nin this island. Each year Hispaniola alone sends between four and five\r\nhundred thousand gold ducats to Spain. This is known from the fact\r\nthat the royal fifth produces eighty, ninety, or a hundred thousand\r\ncastellanos of gold, and sometimes even more. I shall explain later on\r\nwhat may be expected from Cuba and the island of San Juan, which are\r\nequally rich in gold. But we have spoken enough about gold; let us now\r\npass on to salt, with which whatever we buy with gold is seasoned.\r\n\r\nIn a district of the province of Bainoa in the mountains of Daiagon,\r\nlying twelve miles from the salt lake of the Caspian, are mines of\r\nrock salt, whiter and more brilliant than crystal, and similar to the\r\nsalts which so enrich the province of Laletania, otherwise called\r\nCatalonia, belonging to the Duke of Cardona, who is the chief noble of\r\nthat region. People, in a position to compare the two, consider the\r\nsalts of Bainoa the richer. It seems that it is necessary to use iron\r\ntools for mining the salt in Catalonia. It also crumbles very easily\r\nas I know by experience, nor is it harder than spongy stone. The\r\nsalt of Bainoa is as hard as marble. In the province of Caizcimu and\r\nthroughout the territories of Iguanama, Caiacoa, and Quatiaqua springs\r\nof exceptional character are found. At the surface their waters are\r\nfresh, a little deeper down they are salty and at the bottom they\r\nare heavily charged with salt. It is thought that the salt sea-water\r\npartially feeds them, and that the fresh waters on the surface flow\r\nfrom the mountains through subterranean passages. The salt-waters,\r\ntherefore, remain at the bottom while the others rise to the surface,\r\nand the former are not sufficiently strong to entirely corrupt the\r\nlatter. The waters of the middle strata are formed by a mixture of the\r\ntwo others, and share the characteristics of both.\r\n\r\nBy placing one's ear to the ground near the opening of one of these\r\nsprings it is easily perceived that the earth is hollow underneath,\r\nfor one may hear the steps of a horseman a distance of three miles and\r\na man on foot a distance of one mile. It is said there is a district\r\nof _savana_ in the most westerly province of Guaccaiarima, inhabited\r\nby people who only live in caverns and eat nothing but the products\r\nof the forest. They have never been civilised nor had any intercourse\r\nwith any other races of men. They live, so it is said, as people did\r\nin the golden age, without fixed homes or crops or culture; neither do\r\nthey have a definite language. They are seen from time to time, but it\r\nhas never been possible to capture one, for if, whenever they come,\r\nthey see anybody other than natives approaching them, they escape with\r\nthe celerity of a deer. They are said to be quicker than French dogs.\r\n\r\nGive ear, Most Holy Father, to a very amusing exploit of one of these\r\nsavages. The Spaniards own cultivated fields along the edge of the\r\nwoods and thick forests, which some of them went to visit, as though\r\non a pleasure trip, in the month of September, 1514. All at once one\r\nof these dumb men suddenly emerged from the woods and smilingly picked\r\nup from the very midst of the Christians a young boy, son of the owner\r\nof the field, whose wife was a native. The savage fled, making signs\r\nthat the people should follow him, so several Spaniards and a number\r\nof naked natives ran after the robber, without, however, being able to\r\ncatch him. As soon as the facetious savage perceived the Spaniards\r\nhad given up the pursuit, he left the child at a crossroads where the\r\nswineherds pass driving herds to pasture. One of these swineherds\r\nrecognised the child and taking it in his arms brought it back to the\r\nfather, who had been in despair, thinking this savage belonged to the\r\nCarib race, and mourning the child as dead.\r\n\r\nPitch, of a quality much harder and more bitter than that obtained\r\nfrom trees, is found on the reefs of Hispaniola. It consequently\r\nserves better to protect ships against the gnawings of the worms\r\ncalled bromas, of which I have elsewhere spoken at length. There are\r\nlikewise two pitch-producing trees; one is the pine, and the other\r\nis called _copeo_. I shall say nothing about pines, for they grow\r\neverywhere; but let us speak a little about the copeo tree, and give\r\na few details about the pitch and the fruit it produces. The pitch is\r\nobtained in the same manner as from pine-trees, though it is described\r\nas being gathered drop by drop from the burning wood. As for the\r\nfruit, it is as small as a plum and quite good to eat; but it is the\r\nfoliage of the trees which possesses a very special quality. It is\r\nbelieved that this tree is the one whose leaves were used by the\r\nChaldeans, the first inventors of writing, to convey their ideas to\r\nthe absent before paper was invented. The leaf is as large as a palm\r\nand almost round. Using a needle or pin, or a sharp iron or wooden\r\npoint, characters are traced upon it as easily as upon paper.\r\n\r\nIt is laughable to consider what the Spaniards have told the natives\r\nconcerning these leaves. These good people believe the leaves speak in\r\nobedience to the command of the Spaniards. An islander had been sent\r\nby a Spaniard of Santo Domingo, the capital of Hispaniola, to one\r\nof his friends living in the interior of the colony. The messenger\r\nlikewise carried some roasted utias which, as we have said, are\r\nrabbits. On the way, whether from hunger or greediness, he ate three;\r\nthese animals not being larger than rats. The friend wrote upon one\r\nof these leaves what he had received. \"Well, my man,\" the master then\r\nsaid, \"you are a fine lad in whom to put confidence! So you have been\r\nso greedy as to eat the utias I gave you?\" Trembling and amazed the\r\nnative confessed his fault, but asked his master how he had discovered\r\nit. The Spaniard replied: \"The leaf which you yourself have brought\r\nme has told me everything. Moreover, you reached my friend's house at\r\nsuch an hour and you left it at such another.\" In this way our people\r\namuse themselves by mystifying these poor islanders, who think they\r\nare gods, with power to make the very leaves reveal what they believe\r\nto be secret. Thus the news spread through the island that the leaves\r\nspeak in response to a sign from the Spaniards; and this obliges the\r\nislanders to be very careful of whatever is confided to them. Both\r\nsides of these leaves may be used for writing, just as is the case\r\nwith our paper. Such a leaf is thicker than a piece of paper folded in\r\ntwo, and is extraordinarily tough; so much so that when it is freshly\r\nplucked, the letters stand out white upon a green ground, but when it\r\ndries it becomes white and hard like a piece of wood, and then these\r\ncharacters change to yellow; but they remain indelible until it is\r\nburnt, never disappearing, even when the leaf is wet.\r\n\r\nThere is another tree called the _hagua_, whose fruit when green\r\nexudes a juice which dyes so fast everything it touches a greenish\r\nblack, that no washing can destroy this colour within twenty days.\r\nWhen the fruit ripens the juice no longer has this quality; it becomes\r\nedible and has a pleasant taste. There is an herb also, whose smoke\r\nproduces death, like the wood which we have mentioned. Some caciques\r\nhad decided to kill the Spaniards; but not daring to attack them\r\nopenly, they planned to place numerous bunches of this herb in their\r\nhouses and set fire to them, so that the Spaniards, who came to\r\nextinguish the flames, would breathe in the smoke with the germs of a\r\nfatal malady. This plot, however, was circumvented and the instigators\r\nof the crime were punished.\r\n\r\nSince Your Holiness has deigned to write that you are interested in\r\neverything related concerning the new continent, let us now insert,\r\nirrespective of method, a number of facts. We have sufficiently\r\nexplained how maize, agoes, yucca, potatoes, and other edible roots\r\nare sown, cultivated, and used. But we have not yet related how the\r\nIndians learned the properties of these plants; and it is that which\r\nwe shall now explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that the early inhabitants of the islands subsisted for a\r\nlong time upon roots and palms and magueys. The maguey[1] is a plant\r\nbelonging to the class vulgarly called evergreen.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: ..._magueiorum quæ est herba, sedo sive aizoo, quam\r\nvulgus sempervivam appellat, similis_. (Jovis-barba, joubarbe, etc.)]\r\n\r\nThe roots of _guiega_ are round like those of our mushrooms, and\r\nsomewhat larger. The islanders also eat _guaieros_, which resemble our\r\nparsnips; _cibaios_, which are like nuts; _cibaioés_ and _macoanes_,\r\nboth similar to the onion, and many other roots. It is related that\r\nsome years later, a bovite, _i.e._, a learned old man, having remarked\r\na shrub similar to fennel growing upon a bank, transplanted it and\r\ndeveloped therefrom a garden plant. The earliest islanders, who ate\r\nraw yucca, died early; but as the taste is exquisite, they resolved to\r\ntry using it in different ways; boiled or roasted this plant is\r\nless dangerous. It finally came to be understood that the juice was\r\npoisonous; extracting this juice, they made from the cooked flour\r\ncazabi, a bread better suited to human stomachs than wheat bread,\r\nbecause it is more easily digested. The same was the case with other\r\nfood stuffs and maize, which they chose amongst the natural products.\r\nThus it was that Ceres discovered barley and other cereals amongst\r\nthe seeds, mixed with slime, brought down by the high Nile from the\r\nmountains of Ethiopia and deposited on the plain when the waters\r\nreceded, and propagated their culture.\r\n\r\nFor having thus indicated the seeds to be cultivated, the ancients\r\nrendered her divine honours. There are numerous varieties of agoes,\r\ndistinguishable by their leaves and flowers. One of these species is\r\ncalled guanagax; both inside and out, it is of a whitish colour. The\r\nguaragua is violet inside and white outside; another species of agoes\r\nis zazaveios, red outside and white inside. Quinetes are white inside\r\nand red outside. The turma is purplish, the hobos yellowish and the\r\natibunieix has a violet skin and a white pulp. The aniguamar is\r\nlikewise violet outside and white inside and the guaccaracca is just\r\nthe reverse; white outside and violet inside. There are many other\r\nvarieties, upon which we have not yet received any report.\r\n\r\nI am aware that in enumerating these species I shall provoke envious\r\npeople, who will laugh when my writings reach them, at my sending such\r\nminute particulars to Your Holiness, who is charged with such weighty\r\ninterests and on whose shoulders rests the burden of the whole\r\nChristian world. I would like to know from these envious, whether\r\nPliny and the other sages famous for their science sought, in\r\ncommunicating similar details to the powerful men of their day, to be\r\nuseful only to the princes with whom they corresponded. They mingled\r\ntogether obscure reports and positive knowledge, great things and\r\nsmall, generalities and details; to the end that posterity might,\r\nequally with the princes, learn everything together, and also in the\r\nhope that those who crave details and are interested in novelties,\r\nmight be able to distinguish between different countries and regions,\r\nthe earth's products, national customs, and the nature of things. Let\r\ntherefore the envious laugh at the pains I have taken; for my part, I\r\nshall laugh, not at their ignorance, envy, and laziness, but at their\r\ndeplorable cleverness, pitying their passions and recommending them to\r\nthe serpents from which envy draws its venom. If I may believe what\r\nhas been reported to me from Your Holiness by Galeazzo Butrigario and\r\nGiovanni Ruffo, Archbishop of Cosenza, who are the nunzios of your\r\napostolic chair, I am certain that these details will please you. They\r\nare the latest trappings with which I have dressed, without seeking\r\nto decorate them, admirable things; indications merely and not\r\ndescriptions; but you will not reject them. It will repay me to have\r\nburned the midnight oil in your interest, that the recollection of\r\nthese discoveries may not be lost. Each takes the money that suits\r\nhis purse. When a sheep or a pig is cut up, nothing of it remains by\r\nevening; for one man has taken the shoulder, another the rump, another\r\nthe neck, and there are even some who like the tripes and the feet.\r\nBut enough of this digression on the subject of envious men and their\r\nfury; let us rather describe how the caciques congratulate their\r\nfellows when a son is born; and how they shape the beginning of their\r\nexistence to its end, and why every one of them is pleased to bear\r\nseveral names.\r\n\r\nWhen a child is born, all the caciques and neighbours assemble and\r\nenter the mother's chamber. The first to arrive salutes the child and\r\ngives it a name, and those who follow do likewise; \"Hail, brilliant\r\nlamp,\" says one; \"Hail, thou shining one,\" says another; or perhaps\r\n\"Conqueror of enemies,\" \"Valiant hero,\" \"More resplendent than gold,\"\r\nand so on. In this wise the Romans bore the titles of their parents\r\nand ancestors: Adiabenicus, Particus, Armenicus, Dacicus, Germanicus.\r\nThe islanders do the same, in adopting the names given them by the\r\ncaciques. Take, for instance, Beuchios Anacauchoa, the ruler of\r\nXaragua, of whom and his sister, the prudent Anacaona, I have already\r\nspoken at length in my First Decade. Beuchios Anacauchoa was also\r\ncalled _Tareigua Hobin_, which means \"prince resplendent as copper.\"\r\nSo likewise _Starei_, which means \"shining\"; _Huibo_, meaning\r\n\"haughtiness\"; _Duyheiniquem_, meaning a \"rich river.\" Whenever\r\nBeuchios Anacauchoa publishes an order, or makes his wishes known by\r\nheralds' proclamation, he takes great care to have all these names and\r\nforty more recited. If, through carelessness or neglect, a single one\r\nwere omitted, the cacique would feel himself grievously outraged; and\r\nhis colleagues share this view.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine their peculiar practices when drawing up their last\r\nwills. The caciques choose as heir to their properties, the eldest son\r\nof their sister, if such a one exists; and if the eldest sister has no\r\nson, the child of the second or third sister is chosen. The reason is,\r\nthat this child is bound to be of their blood. They do not consider\r\nthe children of their wives as legitimate. When there are no children\r\nof their sisters, they choose amongst those of their brothers, and\r\nfailing these, they fall back upon their own. If they themselves have\r\nno children, they will their estates to whomsoever in the island is\r\nconsidered most powerful, that their subjects may be protected by him\r\nagainst their hereditary enemies. They have as many wives as they\r\nchoose, and after the cacique dies the most beloved of his wives is\r\nburied with him. Anacaona, sister of Beuchios Anacauchoa, King of\r\nXaragua, who was reputed to be talented in the composition of areytos,\r\nthat is to say poems, caused to be buried alive with her brother the\r\nmost beautiful of his wives or concubines, Guanahattabenecheuà; and\r\nshe would have buried others but for the intercession of a certain\r\nsandal-shod Franciscan friar, who happened to be present. Throughout\r\nthe whole island there was not to be found another woman so beautiful\r\nas Guanahattabenecheuà. They buried with her her favourite necklaces\r\nand ornaments, and in each tomb a bottle of water and a morsel of\r\ncazabi bread were deposited.\r\n\r\nThere is very little rain either in Xaragua, the kingdom of Beuchios\r\nAnacauchoa, or in the Hazua district of the country called Caihibi;\r\nalso in the valley of the salt- and fresh-water lakes and in Yacciu, a\r\ndistrict or canton of the province of Bainoa. In all these countries\r\nare ancient ditches, by means of which the islanders irrigate their\r\nfields as intelligently as did the inhabitants of New Carthage, called\r\nSpartana, or those of the kingdom of Murcia, where it rarely rains.\r\nThe Maguana divides the provinces of Bainoa from that of Caihibi,\r\nwhile the Savana divides it from Guaccaiarima. In the deeper valleys\r\nthere is a heavier rainfall than the natives require, and the\r\nneighbourhood of Santo Domingo is likewise better watered than is\r\nnecessary, but everywhere else the rainfall is moderate. The same\r\nvariations of temperature prevail in Hispaniola as in other countries.\r\n\r\nI have enumerated in my First Decade the colonies established in\r\nHispaniola by the Spaniards, and since that time they have founded the\r\nsmall towns of Porto de la Plata, Porto Real, Lares, Villanova,\r\nAssua, and Salvatiera. Let us now describe these of the innumerable\r\nneighbouring islands which are known and which we have already\r\ncompared to the Nereids, daughters of Tethys, and their mother's\r\nornament. I shall begin with the nearest one, which is remarkable\r\nbecause of another fountain of Arethusa, but which serves no purpose.\r\nSix miles distant from the coast of the mother island lies an isle\r\nwhich the Spaniards, ignoring its former name, call Dos Arboles [Two\r\nTrees], because only two trees grow there. It is near them that a\r\nspring, whose waters flow by secret channels under the sea from\r\nHispaniola, gushes forth, just as Alpheus left Eridus to reappear in\r\nSicily at the fountain of Arethusa. This fact is established by the\r\nfinding of leaves of the _hobis_, mirobolane, and many other trees\r\ngrowing in Hispaniola, which are carried thither by the stream of this\r\nfountain, for no such trees are found on the smaller island. This\r\nfountain takes its rise in the Yiamiroa River, which flows from the\r\nGuaccaiarima district near the Savana country. The isle is not more\r\nthan one mile in circumference, and is used as a fish market.\r\n\r\nTowards the east, our Tethys is protected in a manner by the island of\r\nSan Juan,[2] which I have elsewhere described. San Juan has rich gold\r\ndeposits, and its soil is almost as fertile as that of its mother,\r\nHispaniola. Colonists have already been taken there, and are engaged\r\nin gold-seeking. On the north-west Tethys is shielded by the great\r\nisland of Cuba, which for a long time was regarded as a continent\r\nbecause of its length. It is much longer than Hispaniola, and is\r\ndivided in the middle from east to west by the Tropic of Cancer.\r\nHispaniola and the other islands lying to the south of Cuba occupy\r\nalmost the whole intervening space between the Tropic of Cancer and\r\nthe equator. This is the zone which many of the ancients believed to\r\nbe depopulated because of the fierce heat of the sun: in which opinion\r\nthey were mistaken. It is claimed that mines, richer than those of\r\nHispaniola, have been found in Cuba and at the present writing it is\r\nasserted that gold to the value of one hundred and eighty thousand\r\ncastellanos has been obtained there and converted into ingots;\r\ncertainly a positive proof of opulence.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: Porto Rico.]\r\n\r\nJamaica lies still farther to the south and is a prosperous, fertile\r\nisland, of exceptional fecundity, in which, however, there does not\r\nexist a single mountain. It is adapted to every kind of cultivation.\r\nIts inhabitants are formidable because of their warlike temperament.\r\nIt is impossible to establish authority within the brief period since\r\nits occupation. Columbus, the first discoverer, formerly compared\r\nJamaica to Sicily in point of size, but as a matter of fact it is\r\nsomewhat smaller, though not much. This is the opinion of those who\r\nhave carefully explored it. All these people agree as to its inviting\r\ncharacter. It is believed that neither gold nor precious stones will\r\nbe found there; but in the beginning the same opinion was held of\r\nCuba.\r\n\r\nThe island of Guadaloupe, formerly called by the natives Caraqueira,\r\nlies south of Hispaniola, four degrees nearer to the equator. It is\r\nthirty-five miles in circumference and its coast line is broken by two\r\ngulfs, which almost divide it into two different islands, as is the\r\ncase with Great Britain and Caledonia, now called Scotland. It has\r\nnumerous ports. A kind of gum called by the apothecaries _animen\r\nalbum_, whose fumes cure headaches, is gathered there. The fruit of\r\nthis tree is one palm long and looks like a carrot. When opened it is\r\nfound to contain a sweetish flour, and the islanders preserve these\r\nfruits just as our peasants lay by a store of chestnuts and other\r\nsimilar things for the winter. The tree itself might be a fig-tree.\r\nThe edible pineapple and other foods which I have carefully studied\r\nabove also grow in Guadaloupe, and it is even supposed that it was the\r\ninhabitants of this island who originally carried the seeds of all\r\nthese delicious fruits to the other islands.\r\n\r\nIn conducting their man-hunts, the Caribs have scoured all the\r\nneighbouring countries; and whatever they found that was likely to be\r\nuseful to them, they brought back for cultivation. These islanders\r\nare inhospitable and suspicious, and their conquest can only be\r\naccomplished by using force. Both sexes use poisoned arrows and are\r\nvery good shots; so that, whenever the men leave the island on an\r\nexpedition, the women defend themselves with masculine courage against\r\nany assailants. It is no doubt this fact that has given rise to the\r\nexploded belief that there are islands in this ocean peopled entirely\r\nby women. The Admiral Columbus induced me to believe this tale and I\r\nrepeated it in my First Decade.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Guadaloupe there are mountains and fertile plains;\r\nit is watered by beautiful streams. Honey is found in the trees and\r\ncrevices of the rocks, and, as is the case at Palma, one of the\r\nFortunate Isles, honey is gathered amongst briar and bramble bushes.\r\n\r\nThe island recently named La Deseada lies eighteen miles distant from\r\nthe former island, and is twenty miles in circumference.\r\n\r\nThere is another charming island lying ten miles to the south of\r\nGuadaloupe, which is called Galante; its surface is level and it is\r\nthirty miles in circumference. Its name was suggested by its beauty,\r\nfor, in the Spanish, dandies are called _galanes_.[3]\r\n\r\n[Note 3: The island was, in reality, named after one of the ships\r\nof Columbus.]\r\n\r\nNine miles to the east of Guadaloupe lie six other islands called\r\nTodos Santos and Barbadas. These are only barren reefs, but mariners\r\nare obliged to know them. Thirty-five miles north of Guadaloupe looms\r\nthe island called Montserrat, which is forty miles in circumference,\r\nand is dominated by a very lofty mountain. An island called Antigua,\r\nthirty miles distant from Guadaloupe, has a circumference of about\r\nforty miles.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral Diego Columbus, son of the discoverer, told me that when\r\nobliged to go to court he left his wife in Hispaniola, and that she\r\nhad written him that an island with rich gold deposits had been\r\ndiscovered in the midst of the archipelago of the Caribs, but that it\r\nhad not yet been visited. Off the left coast of Hispaniola there lies\r\nto the south and near to the port of Beata an island called Alta Vela.\r\nMost astonishing things are told concerning sea monsters found there,\r\nespecially about the turtles, which are, so it is said, larger than a\r\nlarge breast shield. When the breeding time arrives they come out of\r\nthe sea, and dig a deep hole in the sand, in which they deposit three\r\nor four hundred eggs. When all their eggs are laid, they cover up the\r\nhole with a quantity of earth sufficient to hide them, and go back to\r\ntheir feeding grounds in the sea, without paying further heed to their\r\nprogeny. When the day, fixed by nature, for the birth of these\r\nanimals arrives, a swarm of turtles comes into the world, without the\r\nassistance of their progenitors, and only aided by the sun's rays. It\r\nlooks like an ant-hill. The eggs are almost as large as those of a\r\ngoose, and the flavour of turtle meat is compared to veal.\r\n\r\nThere is a large number of other islands, but they are as yet unknown,\r\nand moreover it is not required to sift al1 this meal so carefully\r\nthrough the sieve. It is sufficient to know that we have in our\r\ncontrol immense countries where, in the course of centuries, our\r\ncompatriots, our language, our morals, and our religion will flourish.\r\nIt was not from one day to another that the Teucrians peopled Asia,\r\nthe Tyrians Libya, or the Greeks and Phoenicians Spain.\r\n\r\nI do not mention the islands which protect the north of Hispaniola;\r\nthey have extensive fisheries and might be cultivated, but the\r\nSpaniards avoid them because they are poor. And now adieu, ancient\r\nTethys:\r\n\r\n  Jam valeant annosa Tethys, nymphæque madentes,\r\n  Ipsius comites; veniat coronata superbe\r\n  Australis pelagi cultrix, re ac nomine dives.[4]\r\n\r\n[Note 4: The following English translation for these lines has\r\nbeen suggested:\r\n\r\n  Farewell, old Tethys, ocean goddess old;\r\n  Farewell thy company, the Nereid band;\r\n  And come thou, rich in name and pearls and gold\r\n  Crowned royally, Queen of the Southern strand.]\r\n\r\nIn the volume of letters I sent Your Holiness last year, by one of my\r\nservants, and which Your Holiness has read in its entirety before the\r\nCardinals of the Apostolic See and your beloved sister, I related that\r\non the same day the Church celebrates the feast of St. Michael the\r\nArchangel, Vasco Nuñez de Balboa, the leader of the men who had\r\ncrossed the lofty mountain chain, had been told that an island\r\nremarkable for the size of its pearls lay within sight of the coast\r\nand that its king was rich and powerful and often made war against the\r\ncaciques whose states lay on the coast, especially Chiapes and Tumaco.\r\nWe have written that the Spaniards did not attack the island because\r\nof the great storms which render that South Sea dangerous, during\r\nthree months of the year. This island has now been conquered and we\r\nhave tamed its proud cacique. May Your Holiness deign to accept him\r\nand all his rich principalities, since he has now received the waters\r\nof baptism. It will not be out of place to remember under whose orders\r\nand by whom this conquest was effected. May Your Holiness attend with\r\nserene brow and benignant ear to the account of this enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK X\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as he landed, the governor, Pedro Arias, confided to a certain\r\nGaspar Morales an expedition to Isla Rica.[1] Morales first passed by\r\nthe country of Chiapes, called Chiapeios, and of Tumaco, those two\r\ncaciques along the South Sea who were friends of Vasco. He and his men\r\nwere received magnificently as friends, and a fleet was equipped for\r\nattacking the island. This island is called Rica and not Margarita,\r\nalthough many pearls are found there; for the name Margarita was first\r\nbestowed upon another island near Paria and the region called Boca de\r\nla Sierpe, where many pearls had likewise been found. Morales landed\r\nupon the island with only sixty men, the dimensions of his boats,\r\ncalled culches, not permitting him to take a larger number. The proud\r\nand formidable king of the island, whose name I have not learned,\r\nadvanced to meet them, escorted by a large number of warriors, and\r\nproffering menaces. Guazzaciara is their war-cry; when they utter this\r\ncry, they let fly their javelins; they do not use bows. Guazzaciara\r\nmeans a battle; so they engaged in four guazzaciaras, in which the\r\nSpaniards, aided by their allies of Chiapes and Tumaco, who were that\r\nchieftain's enemies, were victorious. Their attack was in the nature\r\nof a surprise. The cacique wished to assemble a larger army, but\r\nwas dissuaded by his neighbours along the coast from continuing the\r\nstruggle. Some by their example, and others by threatening him with\r\nthe ruin of a flourishing country, demonstrated that the friendship of\r\nthe Spaniards would bring glory and profit to himself and his friends.\r\nThey reminded him of the misfortunes which had the preceding year\r\nbefallen Poncha, Pochorroso, Quarequa, Chiapes, Tumaco, and others who\r\nattempted to resist. The cacique gave up fighting and came to meet\r\nthe Spaniards, whom he conducted to his palace, which was a veritable\r\nroyal residence marvellously decorated. Upon their arrival at his\r\nhouse he presented them with a very well-wrought basket filled with\r\npearls of ten pounds weight, at eight ounces to the pound.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: The description at this point is inaccurate and\r\nmisleading. The pearl islands number in all one hundred and\r\neighty-three, forming an archipelago. There are thirty-nine islands\r\nof considerable size, of which the principal ones are San José, San\r\nMiguel, and Isla del Rey; the others are small, some being no more\r\nthan reefs, or isolated rocks rising above the surface of the sea.]\r\n\r\nThe cacique was overjoyed when they presented him with their usual\r\ntrifles, such as glass beads, mirrors, copper bells, and perhaps some\r\niron hatchets, for the natives prize these things more than heaps of\r\ngold. In fact, they even make fun of the Spaniards for exchanging such\r\nimportant and useful articles for such a little gold. Hatchets can\r\nbe put to a thousand uses among them, while gold is merely a not\r\nindispensable luxury. Pleased and enchanted by his bargains, the\r\ncacique, took the captain and his officers by the hand and led them\r\nto the top of one of the towers of his house from whence the view\r\nembraced an immense horizon towards the sea. Looking about him, he\r\nsaid: \"Behold the infinite ocean which has no end towards the rising\r\nsun.\" He pointed to the east, and afterwards turning to the south and\r\nthe west he gave them to understand that the continent, on which the\r\nvast mountain ranges were perceptible in the distance, was very large.\r\nGlancing about nearer to them, he said: \"These islands lying to the\r\nleft and right along the two coasts of our residence belong to us.\r\nThey are all rich; they are all happy, if you call lands happy which\r\nabound in gold and pearls. In this particular place there is not much\r\ngold, but the shores of all these islands are strewn with pearls,\r\nand I will give you as many as you want if you will be my friends. I\r\nprefer your manufactures to my pearls, and I wish to possess them.\r\nTherefore do not imagine that I desire to break off relations with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the words, amongst many others similar, they exchanged. When\r\nthe Spaniards planned to leave, the cacique promised to send each year\r\nas a present to the great king of Castile a hundred pounds of pearls,\r\nat eight ounces to the pound. He made this promise voluntarily,\r\nattaching little importance to it, and in no way considering himself\r\ntheir tributary.\r\n\r\nThere are so many rabbits and deer in that island that, without\r\nleaving their houses, the Spaniards could kill as many as they chose\r\nwith their arrows. Their life there was luxurious, and nothing was\r\nwanting. The royal residence lies only six degrees from the equator.\r\nYucca, maize bread, and wine made from grains and fruits, are the same\r\nas at Comogra or amongst the other continental and insular tribes.\r\n\r\nThe cacique, Most Holy Father, was baptised with all his people who\r\nare become as sheep under their shepherd to increase your flock.\r\nPedro Arias, the governor, wished to bestow his name upon them. The\r\nfriendship established increased, and the cacique, to assist the\r\nSpaniards to regain the continent more easily, lent them his\r\nfishermen's culches, that is to say barques dug out of treetrunks in\r\nthe native fashion. He also accompanied them to the shore.\r\n\r\nAfter setting aside the fifth for the royal officials, the Spaniards\r\ndivided amongst themselves the pearls they had secured. They say they\r\nare extremely valuable. Here is a proof of the great value of the\r\npearls from that island. Many of them are white and have a beautiful\r\norient, and are as large or even larger than a nut. What has quickened\r\nmy recollection is the remembrance of a pearl which the Sovereign\r\nPontiff, Paul, predecessor of Your Holiness, bought from a Venetian\r\nmerchant through the intermediary of my relative Bartolomeo the\r\nMilanese, for forty-four thousand ducats. Now amongst the pearls\r\nbrought from the island there is one equal in size to an ordinary\r\nnut. It was sold at auction and bought at Darien for twelve thousand\r\ncastellanos of gold, ending in the hands of the governor, Pedro Arias.\r\nThis precious pearl now belongs to his wife, of whom we have already\r\nspoken at the time of his departure. We may assume, therefore, that\r\nthis pearl was the most precious of all, since it was valued so highly\r\namongst that mass of pearls which were bought, not singly, but by the\r\nounce. It is probable that the Venetian merchant had not paid such a\r\nprice in the East for the pearl of Pope Paul; but he lived at a time\r\nwhen such objects were greedily sought and a lover of pearls was\r\nwaiting to swallow it.\r\n\r\nLet us now say something of the shells in which pearls grow. Your\r\nBeatitude is not ignorant of the fact that Aristotle, and Pliny who\r\nfollowed the former in his theories, were not of the same opinion\r\nconcerning the growth of pearls. They held but one point in common,\r\nand upon all others they differed. Neither would admit that pearl\r\noysters moved after they were once formed. They declare that there\r\nexist at the bottom of the sea, meadows, as it were, upon which an\r\naromatic plant resembling thyme grows; they affirm they had seen these\r\nfields. In such places these animals resembling oysters are born and\r\ngrow, engendering about them numerous progeny. They are not satisfied\r\nto have one, three, four, or even more pearls, for as many as a\r\nhundred and twenty pearls have been found in one shell on the\r\nfisheries of that island; and the captain, Caspar Morales, and his\r\ncompanions carefully counted them. While the Spaniards were there,\r\nthe cacique had his divers bring up pearls. The matrix of these pearl\r\noysters may be compared to the organ in which hens form their numerous\r\neggs. The pearls are produced in the following manner: as soon as they\r\nare ripe and leave the womb of their mother, they are found detached\r\nfrom the lips of the matrix. They follow one by one each in turn\r\ndetaching itself, after a brief interval. In the beginning the pearls\r\nare enclosed, as it were, in the belly of the oyster, where they grow\r\njust as a child while in the womb of its mother lives on the substance\r\nof her body. Later on they leave the maternal asylum, where they were\r\nhidden. The pearl oysters found--as I myself have seen from time to\r\ntime--upon the beach and imbedded in the sand on different Atlantic\r\ncoasts, have been cast up from the depths of the sea by storms, and do\r\nnot come there of themselves. Why brilliant morning dew gives a white\r\ntint to pearls; why bad weather causes them to turn yellow; why they\r\nlike a clear sky, and remain immovable when it thunders, are questions\r\nwhich cannot be examined with precision by those ignorant natives. It\r\nis not a subject that can be treated by limited minds. It is further\r\nsaid that the largest pearl oysters remain at the bottom, the commoner\r\nones in the half-depths, and the little ones near the surface; but\r\nthe reasons given to sustain this theory are poor ones. The immovable\r\nmollusc does not reason about the choice of its home. Everything\r\ndepends on the determination, the ability, and the breath of the\r\ndivers. The large pearl oysters do not move about; they are created\r\nand find their sustenance in the deepest places, for the number of\r\ndivers who venture to penetrate to the bottom of the sea to collect\r\nthem is few. They are afraid of polyps, which are greedy for oyster\r\nmeat and are always grouped about the places where they are. They are\r\nlikewise afraid of other sea-monsters, and most of all they fear to\r\nsuffocate if they stay too long under water. The pearl oysters in the\r\nprofoundest depths of the sea consequently have time to grow, and\r\nthe larger and older the shell becomes, the larger the pearls they\r\nharbour, though in number they are few. Those born at the bottom of\r\nthe sea are believed to become food for the fish; when first gathered\r\nthey are soft, and the shape of the ear is different from the larger\r\nones. It is alleged that no pearl adheres to the shell as it grows\r\nold, but there grows in the shell itself a sort of round and brilliant\r\nlump which acquires lustre by filing. This, however, is not valuable,\r\nand takes its nature rather from the shell than from the pearl. The\r\nSpaniards call the tympanum _pati_.[2] Sometimes pearl oysters have\r\nbeen found growing in small colonies upon rocks, but they are not\r\nprized. It is credible that the oysters of India, Arabia, the Red Sea,\r\nand Ceylon exist in the manner described by celebrated authors, nor\r\nshould the explanations given by such eminent writers be entirely\r\nrejected; I speak of those who have been for a long time in\r\ncontradiction with one another.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: _Pati appellat Hispanus tympanum_; a sentence for which\r\nthe translator has found no satisfactory meaning.]\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken enough about these sea-animals and their eggs,\r\nwhich luxury-loving people stupidly prefer to the eggs of chickens or\r\nducks. Let us add some further details outside our subject.\r\n\r\nWe have above described the entrance to the Gulf of Uraba, and said\r\nthe different countries washed by its waters were strangely different\r\nfrom one another. I have nothing new to relate of the western shore,\r\nwhere the Spaniards established their colony on the banks of the\r\nDarien River.\r\n\r\nWhat I have recently learnt about the eastern shore is as follows:\r\nthe entire country lying to the east between the promontory and shore\r\nwhich extend into the sea and receive the force of the waves, as far\r\nas Boca de la Sierpe and Paria, is called by the general name of\r\nCaribana. Caribs are found everywhere, and are called from the name of\r\ntheir country,[3] but it is well to indicate from whence the Caribs\r\ntake their origin, and how, after leaving their country, they have\r\nspread everywhere like a deadly contagion. Nine miles from the first\r\ncoast encountered coming from seawards where, as we have said, Hojeda\r\nsettled, stands in the province of Caribana a village called Futeraca;\r\nthree miles farther on is the village of Uraba, which gives its name\r\nto the gulf and was formerly the capital of the kingdom. Six miles\r\nfarther on is the village of Feti, and at the ninth and twelfth miles\r\nrespectively stand the villages of Zeremoe and Sorachi, all thickly\r\npopulated. All the natives in these parts indulged in man-hunts, and\r\nwhen there are no enemies to fight they practise their cruelties\r\non one another. From this place the infection has spread to the\r\nunfortunate inhabitants of the islands and continent.\r\n\r\n[Note 3: There are more theories than one concerning the origin of\r\nthe Caribs and their name. Among other writers who have treated this\r\nsubject may be cited Reville, in an article published in the _Nouvelle\r\nRevue_, 1884, and Rochefort in his _Histoire naturelle et morale des\r\nisles Antilles_.]\r\n\r\nThere is another fact I think I should not omit. A learned lawyer\r\ncalled Corales, who is a judge at Darien, reported that he encountered\r\na fugitive from the interior provinces of the west, who sought refuge\r\nwith the cacique. This man, seeing the judge reading, started with\r\nsurprise, and asked through interpreters who knew the cacique's\r\nlanguage, \"You also have books? You also understand the signs by which\r\nyou communicate with the absent?\" He asked at the same time to look\r\nat the open book, hoping to see the same characters used among his\r\npeople; but he saw the letters were not the same. He said that in his\r\ncountry the towns were walled and the citizens wore clothing and were\r\ngoverned by laws. I have not learned the nature of their religion, but\r\nit is known from examining this fugitive, and from his speech, that\r\nthey are circumcised.[4] What, Most Holy Father, do you think of this?\r\nWhat augury do you, to whose domination time will submit all peoples,\r\ndraw for the future?\r\n\r\n[Note 4: ..._recutiti tamen dispræputiatique, ab exemplo et\r\nsermone fugitivi confererunt_. The man may have been a Peruvian or\r\nof the civilised plateau people of Cundinamarca. Wiener, in his\r\ninteresting work, _Perou et Bolivie_, studies the Peruvian system of\r\nwriting.]\r\n\r\nLet us add to these immense considerations some matters of less\r\nimportance. I think that I should not omit mentioning the voyage of\r\nJuan Solis,[5] who sailed from the ocean port of Lepe, near Cadiz,\r\nwith three ships, the fourth day of the ides of September, 1515, to\r\nexplore the southern coasts of what was supposed to be a continent.\r\nNor do I wish to omit mention of Juan Ponce,[6] commissioned to\r\nconquer the Caribs, anthropophagi who feed on human flesh; or of\r\nJuan Ayora de Badajoz, or Francisco Bezerra, and of Valleco, already\r\nmentioned by me. Solis was not successful in his mission. He set out\r\nto double the cape or promontory of San Augustin and to follow the\r\ncoast of the supposed continent as far as the equator. We have already\r\nindicated that this cape lies in the seventh degree of the antarctic\r\npole. Solis continued six hundred leagues farther on, and observed\r\nthat the cape San Augustin extended so far beyond the equator to the\r\nsouth that it reached beyond the thirtieth degree of the Southern\r\nHemisphere. He therefore sailed for a long distance beyond the Boca de\r\nla Sierpe and Spanish Paria, which face the north and the pole star.\r\nIn these parts are found some of those abominable anthropophagi,\r\nCaribs, whom I have mentioned before. With fox-like astuteness these\r\nCaribs feigned amicable signs, but meanwhile prepared their stomachs\r\nfor a succulent repast; and from their first glimpse of the strangers\r\ntheir mouths watered like tavern trenchermen. The unfortunate Solis\r\nlanded with as many of his companions as he could crowd into the\r\nlargest of the barques, and was treacherously set upon by a multitude\r\nof natives who killed him and his men with clubs in the presence of\r\nthe remainder of his crew.[7] Not a soul escaped; and after having\r\nkilled and cut them in pieces on the shore, the natives prepared to\r\neat them in full view of the Spaniards, who from their ships witnessed\r\nthis horrible sight. Frightened by these atrocities, the men did not\r\nventure to land and execute vengeance for the murder of their leader\r\nand companions. They loaded their ships with red wood, which the\r\nItalians call verzino and the Spaniards brazil-wood, and which is\r\nsuitable for dyeing wool; after which they returned home. I have\r\nlearned these particulars by correspondence, and I here repeat them. I\r\nshall further relate what the other explorers accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: Juan Diaz de Solis, a native of Sebixa, sailed with\r\nVincente Yañez Pinzon in 1508, when the mouths of the Amazon were\r\ndiscovered. In 1512, the King appointed him and Giovanni Vespucci his\r\ncartographers.]\r\n\r\n[Note 6: Governor in 1508 of Porto Rico and later, in 1512, the\r\ndiscoverer of Florida, of which country he was appointed Adelantado by\r\nKing Ferdinand. He died in Cuba in 1521, from the effects of a wound\r\nreceived during his expedition to Florida in that year.]\r\n\r\n[Note 7: The scene of this massacre was between Maldonado and\r\nMontevideo.]\r\n\r\nJuan Ponce likewise endured a severe check from the cannibals on the\r\nisland of Guadaloupe, which is the most important of all the Carib\r\nislands. When these people beheld the Spanish ships, they concealed\r\nthemselves in a place from which they could spy upon all the movements\r\nof the people who might land. Ponce had sent some women ashore to wash\r\nsome shirts and linen, and also some foot-soldiers to obtain fresh\r\nwater, for he had not seen land after leaving the island of Ferro in\r\nthe Canaries until he reached Guadaloupe, a distance of four thousand\r\ntwo hundred miles. There is no island in the ocean throughout the\r\nentire distance. The cannibals suddenly attacked and captured the\r\nwomen, dispersing the men, a small number of whom managed to escape.\r\nPonce did not venture to attack the Caribs, fearing the poisoned\r\narrows which these barbarous man-eaters use with fatal effect.\r\n\r\nThis excellent Ponce who, as long as he was in a place of safety, had\r\nboasted that he would exterminate the Caribs, was constrained to leave\r\nhis washerwomen and retreat before the islanders. What he has since\r\ndone, and what discoveries he may have made, I have not yet learned.\r\nThus Solis lost his life, and Ponce his honour, in carrying out their\r\nexpeditions.\r\n\r\nAnother who failed miserably in his undertaking the same year is Juan\r\nAyora de Cordova, a nobleman sent out as judge, as we have elsewhere\r\nsaid, and who was keener about accumulating a fortune than he was\r\nabout administering his office, and deserving praise. Under some\r\npretext or other he robbed several caciques and extorted gold from\r\nthem, in defiance of all justice. It is related that he treated them\r\nso cruelly that, from being friends, they became implacable enemies,\r\nand driven to extremities they massacred the Spaniards, sometimes\r\nopenly and sometimes by setting traps for them. In places where\r\nformerly trade relations were normal and the caciques friendly, it\r\nbecame necessary to fight. When, so it is said, he had amassed a large\r\namount of gold by such means, Ayora fled on board a ship he suddenly\r\nprocured, and it is not known at this present writing where he landed.\r\nThere are not wanting people who believe that the governor himself,\r\nPedro Arias, closed his eyes to this secret flight; for Juan Ayora\r\nis a brother of Gonzales Ayora, the royal historiographer, who is a\r\nlearned man, an excellent captain, and so intimate with the governor\r\nthat he and Pedro Arias may be cited amongst the rare pairs of friends\r\nknown to us. I am in very close relations with both of them, and may\r\nthey both pardon me; but amidst all the troubles in the colonies,\r\nnothing has displeased me so much as the cupidity of this Juan Ayora,\r\nwhich troubled the public peace of the colonies and alienated the\r\ncaciques.\r\n\r\nLet us now come to the tragic adventures of Gonzales de Badajoz\r\nand his companions. In the beginning fortune smiled upon them, but\r\nsufficiently sad changes very quickly followed. Gonzales left Darien\r\nwith forty soldiers in the month of March of the preceding year, 1515,\r\nand marched straight to the west, stopping nowhere until he reached\r\nthe region the Spaniards have named Gracias á Dios, as we have above\r\nstated. This place is about a hundred and eighty miles, or sixty\r\nleagues from Darien. They passed several days there doing nothing,\r\nbecause the commander was unable either by invitations, bribes, or\r\nthreats to induce the cacique to approach him, although he desired\r\nvery much to accomplish this. While camping here he was joined by\r\nfifteen adventurers from Darien, under the leadership of Luis Mercado\r\nwho had left that colony in May, wishing to join Gonzales in exploring\r\nthe interior. As soon as the two groups met, they decided to cross the\r\nsouthern mountain chain and take possession of the South Sea already\r\ndiscovered. The most extraordinary thing of all is, that on a\r\ncontinent of such length and breadth, the distance to the South Sea\r\nwas not more than fifty-one miles, or seventeen leagues. In Spain\r\npeople never count by miles; the land league equals three miles, and\r\nthe marine league four miles. When they reached the summit of the\r\nmountain chain, which is the watershed, they found there a cacique\r\ncalled Javana. Both the country and its ruler bear the name of Coiba,\r\nas we have already stated is the case, at Careta. As the country of\r\nJavana is the richest of all in gold, it is called Coiba Rica. And in\r\nfact, wherever one digs, whether on dry land or in the river-beds,\r\nthe sand is found to contain gold. The cacique Javana fled when the\r\nSpaniards approached, nor was it possible to overtake him. They then\r\nset to work to ravage the neighbourhood of his town, but found\r\nvery little gold, for the cacique had taken with him in his flight\r\neverything he possessed. They found, however, some slaves who were\r\nbranded in a painful fashion. The natives cut lines in the faces of\r\nthe slaves, using a sharp point either of gold or of a thorn; they\r\nthen fill the wounds with a kind of powder dampened with black or\r\nred juice, which forms an indelible dye and never disappears. The\r\nSpaniards took these slaves with them. It seems that this juice is\r\ncorrosive and produces such terrible pain that the slaves are unable\r\nto eat on account of their sufferings. Both the kings who originally\r\ncaptured these slaves in war, and also the Spaniards, put them to work\r\nhunting gold or tilling the fields.\r\n\r\nLeaving the town of Javana, the Spaniards followed the watershed for\r\nten miles, and entered the territory of another chief, whom they\r\ncalled the \"Old Man,\" because they were heedless of his name and took\r\nnotice only of his age. Everywhere in the country of this cacique,\r\nboth in the riverbeds and in the soil, gold was found. Streams were\r\nabundant and the county was everywhere rich and fertile. Leaving that\r\nplace, the Spaniards marched for five days through a desert country\r\nwhich they thought had been devastated by war, for though the greater\r\npart of it was fertile, it was neither inhabited nor cultivated.\r\nOn the fifth day they perceived in the distance two heavily laden\r\nnatives, approaching them. Marching upon them, they captured the men,\r\nand found that they were carrying sacks of maize on their shoulders.\r\nFrom the answers of these men they gathered that there were two\r\ncaciques in these regions, one on the coast, called Periqueta, another\r\nin the interior, called Totonogo; the latter being blind. These two\r\nmen were fishermen who had been sent by their cacique Totonogo, to\r\nPeriqueta, with a burden of fish, which they had traded for bread.[8]\r\nTrade is thereabouts carried on by exchange in kind, and not by means\r\nof gold, which claims so many victims. Led by these two natives, the\r\nSpaniards reached the country of Totonogo, the cacique whose country\r\nextends along the west side of the gulf of San Miguel on the south\r\nsea. This chieftain gave them six thousand castellanos of gold, partly\r\nin ingots and partly worked; amongst the former was one which weighed\r\ntwo castellanos, proving that gold exists in abundance in this region.\r\n\r\n[Note 8: There has evidently at some time been an error of\r\ntranscription: the cacique Totonogo, who is first mentioned as ruling\r\nalong the sea-coast, is now described as sending fish to his neighbour\r\nPeriqueta.]\r\n\r\nFollowing along the western coast, the Spaniards visited the cacique\r\nTaracuru, from whom they obtained eight thousand pesos; a peso, as we\r\nhave already said, corresponding to an unminted castellano. They next\r\nmarched into the country of his brother Pananome, who fled and was\r\nseen no more. His subjects declared the country to be rich in gold.\r\nThe Spaniards destroyed his residence. Six leagues farther on they\r\ncame to the country of another cacique called Tabor, and then to that\r\nof another called Cheru. The latter received the Spaniards amicably,\r\nand offered them four thousand pesos. He possesses valuable salt\r\ndeposits, and the country is rich in gold. Twelve miles farther they\r\ncame to another cacique called Anata, from whom they obtained twelve\r\nthousand pesos, which the cacique had captured from neighbouring\r\nchieftains whom he had conquered. This gold was even scorched, because\r\nit had been carried out of the burning houses of his enemies. These\r\ncaciques rob and massacre one another, and destroy their villages,\r\nduring their atrocious wars. They give no quarter, and the victors\r\nmake a clean sweep of everything.[9]\r\n\r\n[Note 9: This was everywhere the case on the mainland; while it\r\ndoes not excuse the cruelties inflicted by the Spaniards upon the\r\nnative populations in their rapacious struggle for wealth, it may\r\ntemper the undiscriminating sympathy of the emotional to reflect that\r\noppression, torture, extortion, and slavery, not to mention human\r\nsacrifices and cannibalism were practised among them with a hideous\r\ningenuity upon which no refinement introduced by the Spaniards could\r\nimprove.]\r\n\r\nIn this wise the excellent Gonzales de Badajoz and his companions\r\nwandered, without any fixed plan, until they came to the territory\r\nof Anata; and during their journey they had collected piles of gold,\r\ngirdles, women's breast ornaments, earrings, headdresses, necklaces,\r\nand bracelets, to the value of eighty thousand castellanos more. This\r\nthey had acquired, either by trading their merchandise or by pillage\r\nand violence; for the majority of the caciques had opposed their\r\npassage and had sought to resist them. They had in addition forty\r\nslaves, whom they used as beasts of burden to carry their provisions\r\nand baggage, and also to care for the sick.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards traversed the country of a cacique, Scoria, and arrived\r\nat the residence of another called Pariza. They did not expect to be\r\nattacked, but the cacique closed about them with a great number of\r\narmed men, surprising them at a moment when they were off their guard\r\nand scattered. They had no time to seize their weapons; seventy of\r\nthem were wounded or killed, and the rest fled, abandoning their gold\r\nand all their slaves. Very few of them ever came back to Darien.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of all the sages upon the vicissitudes of fortune and the\r\ninconstancy of human affairs would prove unfounded if this expedition\r\nhad terminated profitably and happily; but the ordering of events is\r\ninevitable, and those who tear up the roots, sometimes find sweet\r\nliquorice and sometimes bitter cockle. Woe, however, to Pariza! for he\r\nshall not long rest quietly. This great crime will soon be avenged.\r\nThe governor was preparing to lead a campaign against him in person at\r\nthe head of three hundred and fifty men when he fell ill. The learned\r\njurisconsult, Caspar Espinosa, royal judge at Darien, took his place\r\nand acted as his lieutenant; at the same time the Spaniards sent to\r\nthe island called Rica to collect the tribute of pearls imposed upon\r\nits cacique. We shall in due course learn what happened.\r\n\r\nOther leaders marched against the dwellers on the other side of the\r\ngulf; one of whom, Francisco Bezerra, crossed the head of the gulf and\r\nthe mouth of the Dabaiba River. His band consisted of two officers and\r\na hundred and fifty well-armed soldiers. His plan was to attack the\r\nCaribs in the country of Caribana itself. He first marched against the\r\nvillage of Turufy, of which I have spoken when describing the arrival\r\nof Hojeda. He was provided with engines of war, three cannon firing\r\nlead bullets larger than an egg, forty archers, and twenty-five\r\nmusketeers. It was planned to fire upon the Caribs from a distance\r\nbecause they fight with poisoned arrows. It is not yet known where\r\nBezerra landed nor what he did; but it was feared at Darien when the\r\nvessels were leaving for Spain, that his expedition had turned out\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\nAnother captain, called Vallejo, carried on operations along the lower\r\npart of the gulf, crossing over by another route than that taken by\r\nBezerra; thus one of them menaced Caribana from the front and the\r\nother from behind. Vallejo has come back, but out of seventy men he\r\ntook with him, forty-eight wounded were left in the power of the\r\nCaribs. This is the story told by those who reached Darien, and I\r\nrepeat it.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the ides of October of this year, 1516, Roderigo\r\nColmenares, whom I have above mentioned, and a certain Francisco de la\r\nPuente belonging to the troop commanded by Gonzales de Badajoz came to\r\nsee me. The latter was amongst those who escaped the massacre executed\r\nby the cacique Pariza. Colmenares himself left Darien for Spain after\r\nthe vanquished arrived. Both of them report, one from hearsay and the\r\nother from observation, that a number of islands lie in the South Sea\r\nto the west of the gulf of San Miguel and the Isla Rica and that on\r\nthese islands trees, bearing the same fruits as in the country of\r\nCalicut, grow and are cultivated. It is from the countries of Calicut,\r\nCochin, and Camemor that the Portuguese procure spices. Thus it is\r\nthought that not far from the colony of San Miguel begins the country\r\nwhere spices grow. Many of those who have explored these regions only\r\nawait the authorisation to sail from that coast of the South Sea;\r\nand they offer to build ships at their own cost, if they only be\r\ncommissioned to seek for the spice lands. These men think that ships\r\nshould be built in the gulf of San Miguel itself, and that the idea of\r\nfollowing the coast in the direction of Cape San Augustin should be\r\nabandoned, as that route would be too long, too difficult, and too\r\ndangerous. Moreover it would take them beyond the fortieth degree of\r\nthe southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThis same Francisco, who shared the labours and the perils of Gonzales\r\nsays, that in exploring those countries he saw veritable herds of deer\r\nand wild boar, of which he captured many in the native fashion by\r\ndigging ditches across the trails followed by these animals and\r\ncovering them over with branches; this is the native method of\r\ntrapping these wild quadrupeds. In catching birds they use doves just\r\nas we do. They tie a tame dove in the trees, and the birds of each\r\nspecies which flock about it are then shot with arrows. Another way is\r\nby spreading a net in an open space, sprinkling food round about it,\r\nand placing the tame dove in the middle. The same system is used with\r\nparrots and other birds. The parrots are so stupid that, while one\r\nchatters on a tree in whose branches the bird-catcher is concealed,\r\nthe others flock thither, and allow themselves to be easily caught.\r\nThey are not frightened when they see the bird-catcher, but sit\r\nlooking until the noose is thrown round their necks. Even when they\r\nsee one of their companions captured and thrown into the hunter's bag,\r\nthey do not fly away.\r\n\r\nThere is another system of bird-hunting which is quite original and\r\ndiverting to relate. We have already stated that there exist in the\r\nislands, and especially at Hispaniola, stagnant lakes and ponds upon\r\nwhose waters flutters a whole world of aquatic birds, because those\r\nwaters are covered with grasses, and little fish and a thousand\r\nvarieties of frogs, worms, and insects live in that liquid mud. The\r\nwork of corruption and generation ordained by the secret decree\r\nof providence is promoted in these depths by the heat of the sun.\r\nDifferent species of birds swarm in these waters: ducks, geese, swans,\r\ndivers, gulls, sea-mews, and countless similar.\r\n\r\nWe have elsewhere related that the natives cultivate a tree in their\r\ngardens, whose fruit resembles a large gourd. The natives throw a\r\nlarge quantity of these gourds into the ponds, after having carefully\r\nstopped up the holes by which water is introduced into them, to\r\nprevent their sinking. These gourds, floating about on the water,\r\ninspire the birds with confidence; the hunter then covers his head\r\nwith a sort of cask made of a gourd, one in which there are little\r\nholes for his eyes, like in a mask. He wades into the water up to his\r\nchin, for from their infancy they are all accustomed to swim, and do\r\nnot fear to remain a long time in the water. As the birds find the\r\ngourd which conceals the hunter similar to all the others floating\r\nabout, the man is able to approach the flock. Imitating with his head\r\nthe movements of the floating gourd, he follows the little waves\r\nproduced by the wind, and gradually approaches the birds. Stretching\r\nout his right hand he seizes a bird by the foot, and without being\r\nseen, quickly jerks it under the water and thrusts it into a bag he\r\ncarries. The other birds imagining their companion has dived in search\r\nof food, as they all do, fearlessly continue their movements, and in\r\ntheir turns become victims of the hunter.\r\n\r\nI interrupted my narrative with this description of bird-hunting and\r\nother sport, in order that these harmless tales might divert you from\r\nthe horror you must have felt in reading the story of so many crimes.\r\nI should still like to speak to you concerning a new theory of the\r\ncurrent which drives the waters of the gulf of Paria towards the west;\r\nand also of the system of gold-mining in Darien. These are particulars\r\nwhich have just recently been furnished me. After this dual report,\r\nwhich will be in no sense tragic, I shall take leave of Your Holiness.\r\n\r\nThe Captain Andreas Morales and Oviedo, whom I have above mentioned,\r\ncame to visit me at Madrid, or to be more accurate, at Mantua\r\nCarpetana; and in my presence they had a discussion on the subject of\r\nthis current. They agree that the Spanish possessions extend without\r\ninterruption towards the northern lands behind Cuba and the other\r\nislands, and to the north-west of Hispaniola and Cuba; but they do not\r\nhold the same opinion concerning the current. Andreas claims that the\r\nforce of these waters is broken by the great body of land believed to\r\nbe a continent, and which, as we have said, bends towards the north,\r\nin such wise that, breaking against these obstacles, the waters turn\r\nin a circle and are driven towards the northern coasts of Cuba and the\r\nother lands lying outside the Tropic of Cancer. Thus, these waters,\r\nwhich flow from narrow straits are absorbed, as it were, in the\r\nimmensity of the ocean, and their force is diminished as they spread\r\nthrough immense spaces where they ultimately disappear. I might\r\ncompare this current to the eddies of water in a mill-race. Water\r\nflowing, no matter how rapidly, through a narrow canal, and afterwards\r\nfalling into a lake, at once spreads out; the volume is broken, and\r\nalthough an instant before it flowed riotously, and seemed capable of\r\nsweeping away every obstacle, it is calmed. Even the direction of the\r\ncurrent is no longer perceptible. I once questioned Admiral Diego\r\nColumbus, son and heir of the discoverer, who had crossed these seas,\r\ncoming and going, four times. When asked his opinion, he answered: \"It\r\nis difficult to return as one went; but upon sailing northwards on\r\nthe open ocean to return to Spain, the movement in the waters driving\r\ntowards the east is very perceptible. I think this is probably due to\r\nthe ordinary influence of ebb and flow, and should not be attributed\r\nto those eddyings of the waters. The continent is open, and there must\r\nexist between the two bodies a strait through which these turbulent\r\nwaters escape to the west. In obedience to a decree of Heaven, they\r\ncirculate throughout the entire universe.\"\r\n\r\nOviedo agrees with Andreas in thinking that the continent is closed,\r\nbut he does not believe that this western mass of the continent breaks\r\nthe current, driving it into the vast ocean. He likewise affirms that\r\nhe has carefully noted that the current running westwards, takes its\r\nrise in the open sea; when following along the coast in small ships,\r\nit is the current running eastwards that is struck, so that one may\r\nbe transported in two opposite directions at the same spot. This is\r\na phenomenon which may frequently be observed in rivers, where the\r\nconformation of the banks gives rise to whirlpools. If straws or bits\r\nof wood are thrown into the river at such a place, those which fall\r\ninto the middle are carried away by the current; on the contrary,\r\nthose which drop into some bend along the shore or by a slanting bank,\r\ngo up the current until they again drift into the middle of the river.\r\n\r\nSuch are their opinions, and I repeat them, although they are in\r\ncontradiction. We shall form no well-grounded opinion until the true\r\ncause of this phenomenon has been verified. Meanwhile it is only\r\npossible to set forth these different theories, until the day fixed\r\nand the astronomical moment for the discovery of this secret of Nature\r\nshall arrive. But enough concerning these pelagic currents.\r\n\r\nSome few more words about gold mines at Darien, and we shall have\r\naccomplished our task.\r\n\r\nWe have said that nine miles from Darien begin the hills and plains\r\ncontaining gold deposits, either in the earth or in the bed or the\r\nbanks of the rivers. Any one who has been bitten by the gold fever\r\nusually sets out as follows: the directors assign him a parcel of\r\nground twelve paces square, which he may choose as he pleases, on\r\ncondition that it is not land that has already been occupied or\r\nabandoned by his companions. When he has made his choice, he settles\r\non that spot with his slaves, as though within a temple, whose limits\r\nthe Augurs have traced with their sacred staves. The Christians use\r\nnative labour both in the mines and in agriculture. This plot of land\r\nmay be held as long as the occupant wishes; and in case no gold, or\r\nvery little, should be found there, a request for a fresh square of\r\nlike dimensions is presented, and the parcel of abandoned land reverts\r\nto the common demesne. This is the order followed by the colonists of\r\nDarien who are engaged in gold-seeking. I think it is the same for the\r\nothers, but I have not questioned all of them. Sometimes such a parcel\r\nof twelve paces square has netted its possessor the sum of eighty\r\ncastellanos. Such is the life people lead to satisfy the sacred hunger\r\nfor gold;[10] but the richer one becomes by such work, the more does\r\none desire to possess. The more wood is thrown on the fire, the more\r\nit crackles and spreads. The sufferer from dropsy, who thinks to\r\nappease his thirst by drinking, only excites it the more. I have\r\nsuppressed many details to which I may later return if I learn that\r\nthey afford pleasure to Your Holiness, charged with the weight of\r\nreligious questions and sitting at the summit of the honours to which\r\nmen may aspire. It is in no sense for my personal pleasure that I have\r\ncollected these facts, for only the desire to please Your Beatitude\r\nhas induced me to undertake this labour.\r\n\r\n[Note 10: _Sic vivitur in sacra fame auri explenda_.]\r\n\r\nMay Providence, which watches over this world, grant to Your Holiness\r\nmany happy years.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. I.",
