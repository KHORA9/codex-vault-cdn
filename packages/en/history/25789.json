So\r\nmuch time must be allowed for the swing and rebound of taste, for the\r\ndespoiling of tawdry splendours and to permit the work of art itself to\r\nform a public capable of appreciating it. Such marvellous fragments\r\nreach us of Elizabethan praises; and we cannot help recalling the number\r\nof copies of 'Prometheus Unbound' sold in the lifetime of the poet. We\r\nknow too well \"what porridge had John Keats,\" and remember with\r\nmisgiving the turtle to which we treated Hobbs and Nobbs at dinner, and\r\nhow complacently we watched them put on their laurels afterwards.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, by all means distrust our own and the public estimation of\r\nall heroes dead within a hundred years. Let us, in laying claim to an\r\ninfallible verdict, remember how oddly our decisions sound at the other\r\nside of Time's whispering gallery. Shall we therefore pronounce only on\r\nChaucer and Shakespeare, on Gower and our learned Ben? Alas! we are too\r\nsure of their relative merits; we stake our reputations with no qualms,\r\nno battle-ardours. These we reserve to them for whom the future is not\r\nyet secure, for whom a timely word may still be spoken, for whom we yet\r\nmay feel that lancing out of enthusiasm only possible when the cast of\r\nfate is still unknown, and, as we fight, we fancy that the glory of our\r\nhero is in our hands.\r\n\r\nBut very gradually the victory is gained. A taste is unconsciously\r\nformed for the qualities necessary to the next development of\r\nart--qualities which Blake in his garret, Millet without the sou, set\r\ndown in immortal work. At last, when the time is ripe, some connoisseur\r\nsees the picture, blows the dust from the book, and straightway blazons\r\nhis discovery. Mr. Swinburne, so to speak, blew the dust from 'Wuthering\r\nHeights'; and now it keeps its proper rank in the shelf where Coleridge\r\nand Webster, Hofmann and Leopardi have their place. Until then, a few\r\nbrave lines of welcome from Sydney Dobell, one fine verse of Mr.\r\nArnold's, one notice from Mr. Reid, was all the praise that had been\r\ngiven to the book by those in authority. Here and there a mill-girl in\r\nthe West Riding factories read and re-read the tattered copy from the\r\nlending library; here and there some eager, unsatisfied, passionate\r\nchild came upon the book and loved it, in spite of chiding, finding in\r\nit an imagination that satisfied, and a storm that cleared the air; or\r\nsome strong-fibred heart felt without a shudder the justice of that\r\nstern vision of inevitable, inherited ruin following the chance-found\r\nchild of foreign sailor and seaport mother. But these readers were not\r\nmany; even yet the book is not popular.\r\n\r\nFor, in truth, the qualities that distinguish Emily Bronte are not those\r\nwhich are of the first necessity to a novelist. She is without\r\nexperience; her range of character is narrow and local; she has no\r\natmosphere of broad humanity like George Eliot; she has not Jane\r\nAusten's happy gift of making us love in a book what we have overlooked\r\nin life; we do not recognise in her the human truth and passion, the\r\nnever-failing serene bitterness of humour, that have made for Charlotte\r\nBronte a place between Cervantes and Victor Hugo.\r\n\r\nEmily Bronte is of a different class. Her imagination is narrower, but\r\nmore intense; she sees less, but what she sees is absolutely present: no\r\nwriter has described the moors, the wind, the skies, with her passionate\r\nfidelity, but this is all of Nature that she describes. Her narrow\r\nfervid nature accounted as simple annoyance the trivial scenes and\r\npersonages touched with immortal sympathy and humour in 'Villette' and\r\n'Shirley'; Paul Emanuel himself appeared to her only as a pedantic and\r\nexacting taskmaster; but, on the other hand, to a certain class of mind,\r\nthere is nothing in fiction so moving as the spectacle of Heathcliff\r\ndying of joy--an unnatural, unreal joy--his panther nature paralysed,\r\n_aneanti_, in a delirium of visionary bliss.\r\n\r\nOnly an imagination of the rarest power could conceive such a\r\ndenouement, requiting a life of black ingratitude by no mere common\r\nhorrors, no vulgar Bedlam frenzy; but by the torturing apprehension of a\r\nhappiness never quite grasped, always just beyond the verge of\r\nrealisation. Only an imagination of the finest and rarest touch,\r\nabsolutely certain of tread on that path of a single hair which alone\r\nconnects this world with the land of dreams. Few have trod that perilous\r\nbridge with the fearlessness of Emily Bronte: that is her own ground and\r\nthere she wins our highest praise; but place her on the earth, ask her\r\nto interpret for us the common lives of the surrounding people, she can\r\ngive no answer. The swift and certain spirit moves with the clumsy\r\nhesitating gait of a bird accustomed to soar.\r\n\r\nShe tells us what she saw; and what she saw and what she was incapable\r\nof seeing are equally characteristic. All the wildness of that moorland,\r\nall the secrets of those lonely farms, all the capabilities of the one\r\ntragedy of passion and weakness that touched her solitary life, she\r\ndivined and appropriated; but not the life of the village at her feet,\r\nnot the bustle of the mills, the riots, the sudden alternations of\r\nwealth and poverty; not the incessant rivalry of church and chapel; and\r\nwhile the West Riding has known the prototype of nearly every person and\r\nnearly every place in 'Jane Eyre' and 'Shirley,' not a single character\r\nin 'Wuthering Heights' ever climbed the hills round Haworth.\r\n\r\nSay that two foreigners have passed through Staffordshire, leaving us\r\ntheir reports of what they have seen. The first, going by day, will tell\r\nus of the hideous blackness of the country; but yet more, no doubt, of\r\nthat awful, patient struggle of man with fire and darkness, of the grim\r\ncourage of those unknown lives; and he would see what they toil for,\r\nwomen with little children in their arms; and he would notice the blue\r\nsky beyond the smoke, doubly precious for such horrible environment. But\r\nthe second traveller has journeyed through the night; neither squalor\r\nnor ugliness, neither sky nor children, has he seen, only a vast stretch\r\nof blackness shot through with flaming fires, or here and there burned\r\nto a dull red by heated furnaces; and before these, strange toilers,\r\nhalf naked, scarcely human, and red in the leaping flicker and gleam of\r\nthe fire. The meaning of their work he could not see, but a fearful and\r\nimpressive phantasmagoria of flame and blackness and fiery energies at\r\nwork in the encompassing night.\r\n\r\nSo differently did the black country of this world appear to Charlotte,\r\nclear-seeing and compassionate, and to Emily Bronte, a traveller through\r\nthe shadows. Each faithfully recorded what she saw, and the place was\r\nthe same, but how unlike the vision! The spectacles of temperament\r\ncolour the world very differently for each beholder; and, to understand\r\nthe vision, we too should for a moment look through the seer's glass. To\r\ngain some such transient glance, to gain and give some such momentary\r\ninsight into the character of Emily Bronte, has been the aim I have\r\ntried to make in this book. That I have not fulfilled my desire is\r\nperhaps inevitable--the task has been left too long. If I have done\r\nanything at all I feel that much of the reward is due to my many and\r\ngenerous helpers. Foremost among them I must thank Dr. Ingham, my kind\r\nhost at Haworth, Mrs. Wood, Mr. William Wood, Mrs. Brown, and Mrs.\r\nRatcliffe of that parish--all of whom had known the now perished family\r\nof Bronte; and my thanks are due no less to Mr. T. Wemyss Reid, as will\r\nbe seen further on, to Mr. J. H. Ingram, and to Mr. Biddell, who have\r\ncollected much valuable information for my benefit; and most of all do I\r\nowe gratitude and thankfulness to Miss Ellen Nussey, without whose\r\ngenerous help my work must have remained most ignorant and astray. To\r\nher, had it been worthier, had it been all the subject merits, and yet\r\nwithout those shadows of gloom and trouble enjoined by the nature of the\r\nstory; to her, could I only have spoken of the high noble character of\r\nEmily Bronte and not of the great trials of her life, I should have\r\nventured to dedicate this study. But to Emily's friend I only offer\r\nwhat, through her, I have learned of Emily; she, who knew so little of\r\nBranwell's shames and sorrow is unconcerned with this, their sad and\r\nnecessary record. Only the lights and sunshine of my work I dedicate to\r\nher. It may be that I have given too great a share to the shadows, to\r\nthe manifold follies and failures of Branwell Bronte. Yet in Emily\r\nBronte's life the shaping influences were so few, and the sins of this\r\nbeloved and erring brother had so large a share in determining the bent\r\nof her genius, that to have passed them by would have been to ignore the\r\nshock which turned the fantasy of the 'Poems' into the tragedy of\r\n'Wuthering Heights.' It would have been to leave untold the patience,\r\nthe courage, the unselfishness which perfected Emily Bronte's heroic\r\ncharacter; and to have left her burdened with the calumny of having\r\nchosen to invent the crimes and violence of her _dramatis personae_. Not\r\nso, alas! They were but reflected from the passion and sorrow that\r\ndarkened her home; it was no perverse fancy which drove that pure and\r\ninnocent girl into ceaseless brooding on the conquering force of sin and\r\nthe supremacy of injustice.\r\n\r\nShe brooded over the problem night and day; she took its difficulties\r\npassionately to heart; in the midst of her troubled thoughts she wrote\r\n'Wuthering Heights.' From the clear spirit which inspires the end of her\r\nwork, we know that the storm is over; we know that her next tragedy\r\nwould be less violent. But we shall never see it; for--and it is by this\r\nthat most of us remember her--suddenly and silently she died.\r\n\r\nShe died, before a single word of worthy praise had reached her. She\r\ndied with her work misunderstood and neglected. And yet not unhappy. For\r\nher home on the moors was very dear to her, the least and homeliest\r\nduties pleasant; she loved her sisters with devoted friendship, and she\r\nhad many little happinesses in her patient, cheerful, unselfish life.\r\nWould that I could show her as she was!--not the austere and violent\r\npoetess who, cuckoo-fashion, has usurped her place; but brave to fate\r\nand timid of man; stern to herself, forbearing to all weak and erring\r\nthings; silent, yet sometimes sparkling with happy sallies. For to\r\nrepresent her as she was would be her noblest and most fitting\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPARENTAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily Bronte was born of parents without any peculiar talent for\r\nliterature. It is true that her mother's letters are precisely and\r\nprettily written. It is true that her father published a few tracts and\r\nreligious poems. But in neither case is there any vestige of literary or\r\npoetical endowment. Few, indeed, are the Parish Magazines which could\r\nnot show among their contents poems and articles greatly superior to the\r\nweak and characterless effusions of the father of the Brontes. The fact\r\nseems important; because in this case not one member of a family, but a\r\nwhole family, is endowed in more or less degree with faculties not\r\nderived from either parent.\r\n\r\nFor children may inherit genius from parents who are themselves not\r\ngifted, as two streaming currents of air unite to form a liquid with\r\nproperties different from either; and never is biography more valuable\r\nthan when it allows us to perceive by what combination of allied\r\nqualities, friction of opposing temperaments, recurrence of ancestral\r\ntraits, the subtle thing we call character is determined. In this case,\r\nsince, as I have said, the whole family manifested a brilliance not to\r\nbe found in either parent, such a study would be peculiarly interesting.\r\nBut, unfortunately, the history of the children's father and the\r\nconstitution of the children's mother is all that is clear to our\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nYet even out of this very short pedigree two important factors of genius\r\ndeclare themselves--two potent and shaping inheritances. From their\r\nfather, Currer, Ellis, and Acton derived a strong will. From their\r\nmother, the disease that slew Emily and Anne in the prime of their youth\r\nand made Charlotte always delicate and ailing. In both cases the boy,\r\nPatrick Branwell, was very slightly affected; but he too died young,\r\nfrom excesses that suggest a taint of insanity in his constitution.\r\n\r\nInsanity and genius stand on either side consumption, its worse and\r\nbetter angels. Let none call it impious or absurd to rank the greatest\r\ngift to mankind as the occasional result of an inherited tendency to\r\ntubercular disease. There are of course very many other determining\r\ncauses; yet is it certain that inherited scrofula or phthisis may come\r\nout, not in these diseases, or not only in these diseases, but in an\r\nalteration, for better or for worse, of the condition of the mind. Out\r\nof evil good may come, or a worse evil.\r\n\r\nThe children's father was a nervous, irritable and violent man, who\r\nendowed them with a nervous organisation easily disturbed and an\r\nindomitable force of volition. The girls, at least, showed both these\r\ncharacteristics. Patrick Branwell must have been a weaker, more\r\nbrilliant, more violent, less tenacious, less upright copy of his\r\nfather; and seems to have suffered no modification from the patient and\r\nsteadfast moral nature of his mother. She was the model that her\r\ndaughters copied, in different degrees, both in character and health.\r\nPassion and will their father gave them. Their genius came directly from\r\nneither parent; but from the constitution of their natures.\r\n\r\nIn addition, on both sides, the children got a Celtic strain; and this\r\nis a matter of significance, meaning a predisposition to the\r\nsuperstition, imagination and horror that is a strand in all their work.\r\nTheir mother, Maria Branwell, was of a good middle-class Cornish family,\r\nlong established as merchants in Penzance. Their father was the son of\r\nan Irish peasant, Hugh Prunty, settled in the north of Ireland, but\r\nnative to the south.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Rev. Patrick Bronte, B.A. (whose fine Greek name,\r\nshortened from the ancient Irish appellation of Bronterre, was so\r\nnaively admired by his children), is itself a remarkable and interesting\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Patrick Bronte was one of the ten children of a peasant\r\nproprietor at Ahaderg in county Down. The family to which he belonged\r\ninherited strength, good looks, and a few scant acres of potato-growing\r\nsoil. They must have been very poor, those ten children, often hungry,\r\ncold and wet; but these adverse influences only seemed to brace the\r\nsinews of Patrick Prunty and to nerve his determination to rise above\r\nhis surroundings. He grew up a tall and strong young fellow, unusually\r\nhandsome with a well-shaped head, regular profile and fine blue eyes. A\r\nvivacious impressible manner effectually masked a certain selfishness\r\nand rigour of temperament which became plain in after years. He seemed a\r\ngenerous, quick, impulsive lad. When he was sixteen years of age Patrick\r\nleft his father's roof resolved to earn a position for himself. At\r\nDrumgooland, a neighbouring hamlet, he opened what is called in Ireland\r\na public school; a sort of hedge-school for village children. He stuck\r\nto his trade for five or six years, using his leisure to perfect himself\r\nin general knowledge, mathematics, and a smattering of Greek and Latin.\r\n\r\nHis efforts deserved to be crowned with success. The Rev. Mr. Tighe,\r\nthe clergyman of the parish, was so struck with Patrick Prunty's\r\ndetermination and ability that he advised him to try for admittance at\r\none of the English universities; and when the young man was about\r\nfive-and-twenty he went, with Mr. Tighe's help, to Cambridge, and\r\nentered at St. John's.\r\n\r\nHe left Ireland in July, 1802, never to visit it again. He never cared\r\nto look again on the scenes of his early struggle. He never found the\r\nmeans to revisit mother or home, friends or country. Between Patrick\r\nBronte, proud of his Greek profile and his Greek name, the handsome\r\nundergraduate at St. John's, and the nine shoeless, hungry young Pruntys\r\nof Ahaderg, there stretched a distance not to be measured by miles.\r\nUnder his warm and passionate exterior a fixed resolution to get on in\r\nthe world was hidden; but, though cold, the young man was just and\r\nself-denying, and as long as his mother lived she received twenty pounds\r\na year, spared with difficulty from his narrow income.\r\n\r\nPatrick Bronte stayed four years at Cambridge; when he left he had\r\ndropped his Irish accent and taken his B.A. On leaving St. John's he was\r\nordained to a curacy in Essex.\r\n\r\nThe young man's energy, of the sort that only toils to reach a given\r\npersonal end, had carried him far on the way to success. At twenty\r\nhedge-schoolmaster at Drumgooland, Patrick Bronte was at thirty a\r\nrespectable clergyman of the Church of England, with an assured position\r\nand respectable clerical acquaintance. He was getting very near the\r\ngoal.\r\n\r\nHe did not stay long in Essex. A better curacy was offered to him at\r\nHartshead, a little village between Huddersfield and Halifax in\r\nYorkshire. While he was at Hartshead the handsome inflammable Irish\r\ncurate met Maria Branwell at her uncle's parsonage near Leeds. It was\r\nnot the first time that Patrick Bronte had fallen in love; people in the\r\nneighbourhood used to smile at his facility for adoration, and thought\r\nit of a piece with his enthusiastic character. They were quite right; in\r\nhis strange nature the violence and the coldness were equally genuine,\r\nboth being a means to gratify some personal ambition, desire, or\r\nindolence. It is not an uncommon Irish type; self-important, upright,\r\nhonourable, yet with a bent towards subtlety: abstemious in habit, but\r\nwith freaks of violent self-indulgence; courteous and impulsive towards\r\nstrangers, though cold to members of the household; naturally violent,\r\nand often assuming violence as an instrument of authority; selfish and\r\ndutiful; passionate, and devoid of intense affection.\r\n\r\nMiss Branwell was precisely the little person with whom it was natural\r\nthat such a man, a self-made man, should fall in love. She was very\r\nsmall, quiet and gentle, not exactly pretty, but elegant and ladylike.\r\nShe was, indeed, a well-educated young lady of good connections; a very\r\nPhoenix she must have seemed in the eyes of a lover conscious of a\r\nbackground of Pruntyism and potatoes. She was about twenty-one and he\r\nthirty-five when they first met in the early summer of 1812. They were\r\nengaged in August. Miss Branwell's letters reveal a quiet intensity of\r\ndevotion, a faculty of judgment, a willingness to forgive passing\r\nslights that must have satisfied the absolute and critical temper of her\r\nlover. Under the devotion and the quietness there is, however, the note\r\nof an independent spirit, and the following extract, with its capability\r\nof self-reliance and desire to rely upon another, reminds one curiously\r\nof passages in her daughter Charlotte's writings:--\r\n\r\n     \"For some years I have been perfectly my own mistress,\r\n     subject to no control whatever; so far from it that my\r\n     sisters, who are many years older than myself, and even my\r\n     dear mother used to consult me on every occasion of\r\n     importance, and scarcely ever doubted the propriety of my\r\n     words and actions: perhaps you will be ready to accuse me of\r\n     vanity in mentioning this, but you must consider that I do\r\n     not boast of it. I have many times felt it a disadvantage,\r\n     and although, I thank God, it has never led me into error,\r\n     yet in circumstances of uncertainty and doubt I have deeply\r\n     felt the want of a guide and instructor.\"\r\n\r\nYears afterwards, when Maria Branwell's letters were given into the\r\nhands of her daughter Charlotte and that daughter's most dear and\r\nfaithful friend, the two young women felt a keen pang of retrospective\r\nsympathy for the gentle independent little person who, even before her\r\nmarriage, had time to perceive that her guide and instructor was not the\r\ninfallible Mentor she had thought him at the first. I quote the words of\r\nCharlotte's friend, of more authority and weight on this matter than\r\nthose of any other person living, taken from a manuscript which she has\r\nplaced at my disposal:--\r\n\r\n     \"Miss Branwell's letters showed that her engagement, though\r\n     not a prolonged one, was not as happy as it ought to have\r\n     been. There was a pathos of apprehension (though gently\r\n     expressed) in part of the correspondence lest Mr. Bronte\r\n     should cool in his affection towards her, and the readers\r\n     perceived with some indignation that there had been a just\r\n     cause for this apprehension. Mr. Bronte, with all his iron\r\n     strength and power of will, had his weakness, and one which,\r\n     wherever it exists, spoils and debases the character--he had\r\n     _personal vanity_. Miss Branwell's finer nature rose above\r\n     such weakness; but she suffered all the more from evidences\r\n     of it in one to whom she had given her affections and whom\r\n     she was longing to look up to in all things.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of December, 1812, this disillusioned, loving little lady\r\nwas married to Patrick Bronte, from her uncle's parsonage near Leeds.\r\nThe young couple took up their abode at Hartshead, Mr. Bronte's curacy.\r\nThree years afterwards they moved, with two little baby girls, Maria and\r\nElizabeth, to a better living at Thornton. The country round is desolate\r\nand bleak; great winds go sweeping by; young Mrs. Bronte, whose husband\r\ngenerally sat alone in his study, would have missed her cheerful home in\r\nsunny Penzance (being delicate and prone to superstition), but that she\r\nwas a patient and uncomplaining woman, and she had scant time for\r\nthought among her many cares for the thick-coming little lives that\r\npeopled her Yorkshire home. In 1816 Charlotte Bronte was born. In the\r\nnext year Patrick Branwell. In 1818 Emily Jane. In 1819 Anne. Then the\r\nhealth of their delicate and consumptive mother began to break. After\r\nseven years' marriage and with six young children, Mr. and Mrs. Bronte\r\nmoved on the 25th of February, 1820, to their new home at Haworth\r\nVicarage.\r\n\r\nThe village of Haworth stands, steep and grey, on the topmost side of an\r\nabrupt low hill. Such hills, more steep than high, are congregated\r\nround, circle beyond circle, to the utmost limit of the horizon. Not a\r\nwood, not a river. As far as eye can reach these treeless hills, their\r\nsides cut into fields by grey walls of stone, with here and there a grey\r\nstone village, and here and there a grey stone mill, present no other\r\ncolours than the singular north-country brilliance of the green grass,\r\nand the blackish grey of the stone. Now and then a toppling, gurgling\r\nmill-beck gives life to the scene. But the real life, the only beauty of\r\nthe country, is set on the top of all the hills, where moor joins moor\r\nfrom Yorkshire into Lancashire, a coiled chain of wild free places.\r\nWhite with snow in winter, black at midsummer, it is only when spring\r\ndapples the dark heather-stems with the vivid green of the sprouting\r\nwortleberry bushes, only when in early autumn the moors are one humming\r\nmass of fragrant purple, that any beauty of tint lights up the scene.\r\nBut there is always a charm in the moors for hardy and solitary spirits.\r\nBetween them and heaven nothing dares to interpose. The shadows of the\r\ncoursing clouds alter the aspect of the place a hundred times a day. A\r\nhundred little springs and streams well in its soil, making spots of\r\nlivid greenness round their rise. A hundred birds of every kind are\r\nflying and singing there. Larks sing; cuckoos call; all the tribes of\r\nlinnets and finches twitter in the bushes; plovers moan; wild ducks fly\r\npast; more melancholy than all, on stormy days, the white sea-mews cry,\r\nblown so far inland by the force of the gales that sweep irresistibly\r\nover the treeless and houseless moors. There in the spring you may take\r\nin your hands the weak, halting fledgelings of the birds; rabbits and\r\ngame multiply in the hollows. There in the autumn the crowds of bees,\r\nmad in the heather, send the sound of their humming down the village\r\nstreet. The winds, the clouds, Nature and life, must be the friends of\r\nthose who would love the moors.\r\n\r\nBut young Mrs. Bronte never could go on the moors. She was frail and\r\nweak, poor woman, when she came to live in the oblong grey stone\r\nparsonage on the windy top of the hill. The village ran sheer down at\r\nher feet; but she could not walk down the steep rough-paven street, nor\r\non the pathless moors. She was very ill and weak; her husband spent\r\nnearly all his time in the study, writing his poems, his tracts, and his\r\nsermons. She had no companions but the children. And when, in a very few\r\nmonths, she found that she was sickening of a cancer, she could not bear\r\nto see much of the children that she must leave so soon.\r\n\r\nWho dare say if that marriage was happy? Mrs. Gaskell, writing in the\r\nlife and for the eyes of Mr. Bronte, speaks of his unwearied care, his\r\ndevotion in the night-nursing. But before that fatal illness was\r\ndeclared, she lets fall many a hint of the young wife's loneliness\r\nduring her husband's lengthy, ineffectual studies; of her patient\r\nsuffering of his violent temper. She does not say, but we may suppose,\r\nwith what inward pleasure Mrs. Bronte witnessed her favourite silk dress\r\ncut into shreds because her husband's pride did not choose that she\r\nshould accept a gift; or watched the children's coloured shoes thrown on\r\nthe fire, with no money in her purse to get new ones; or listened to her\r\nhusband's cavil at the too frequent arrival of his children; or heard\r\nthe firing of his pistol-shots at the out-house doors, the necessary\r\nvent of a passion not to be wreaked in words. She was patient, brave,\r\nlonely, and silent. But Mr. Wemyss Reid, who has had unexampled\r\nfacilities for studying the Bronte papers, does not scruple to speak of\r\nMr. Bronte's \"persistent coldness and neglect\" of his wife, his \"stern\r\nand peremptory\" dealings with her, of her \"habitual dread of her lordly\r\nmaster\"; and the manuscript which I have once already quoted alludes to\r\nthe \"hard and inflexible will which raised itself sometimes into tyranny\r\nand cruelty.\" It is within the character of the man that all this should\r\nbe true. Safely wed, the woman to whom he had made hot love would\r\nexperience no more of his impulsive tenderness. He had provided for her\r\nand done his duty; her duty was to be at hand when he needed her. Yet,\r\nimminent death once declared, all his uprightness, his sense of honour,\r\nwould call on him to be careful to the creature he had vowed to love and\r\ncherish, all his selfishness would oblige him to try and preserve the\r\nmother of six little children under seven years of age. \"They kept\r\nthemselves very close,\" the village people said; and at least in this\r\nlast illness the husband and wife were frequently together. Their love\r\nfor each other, new revived and soon to close, seemed to exclude any\r\nthought of the children. We hear expressly that Mr. Bronte, from natural\r\ndisinclination, and Mrs. Bronte, from fear of agitation, saw very little\r\nof the small earnest babies who talked politics together in the\r\n\"children's study,\" or toddled hand in hand over the neighbouring moors.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the young mother grew weaker day by day, suffering great pain\r\nand often unable to move. But repining never passed her lips. Perhaps\r\nshe did not repine. Perhaps she did not grieve to quit her harassed\r\nlife, the children she so seldom saw, her constant pain, the husband\r\n\"not dramatic enough in his perceptions to see how miserable others\r\nmight be in a life that to him was all-sufficient.\"[1] For some months\r\nshe lay still, asking sometimes to be lifted in bed that she might watch\r\nthe nurse cleaning the grate, because she did it as they did in\r\nCornwall. For some months she suffered more and more. In September,\r\n1821, she died.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mrs. Gaskell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nBABYHOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter his wife's death the Rev. Mr. Bronte's life grew yet more\r\nsecluded from ordinary human interests. He was not intimate with his\r\nparishioners; scarcely more intimate with his children. He was proud of\r\nthem when they said anything clever, for, in spite of their babyhood, he\r\nfelt at such moments that they were worthy of their father; but their\r\nforlorn infancy, their helpless ignorance, was no appeal to his heart.\r\nSome months before his wife's death he had begun to take his dinner\r\nalone, on account of his delicate digestion; and he continued the habit,\r\nseeing the children seldom except at breakfast and tea, when he would\r\namuse the elders by talking Tory politics with them, and entertain the\r\nbaby, Emily, with his Irish tales of violence and horror. Perhaps on\r\naccount of this very aloofness, he always had a great influence over the\r\nchildren; he did not care for any dearer relation.\r\n\r\nHis empty days were filled with occasional visits to some sick person in\r\nthe village; with long walks alone over the moors, and with the\r\ncomposition of his 'Cottage in the Wood' and those grandiloquent sermons\r\nwhich still linger in the memory of Haworth. Occasionally a clergyman\r\nfrom one of the neighbouring villages would walk over to see him; but as\r\nMrs. Bronte had died so soon after her arrival at Haworth their wives\r\nnever came, and the Bronte children had no playfellows in the vicarages\r\nnear; nor were they allowed to associate with the village children.\r\n\r\nThis dull routine life suited Mr. Bronte. He had laboured for many years\r\nand now he took his repose. We get no further sign of the impatient\r\nenergies of his youth. He had changed, developed; even as those\r\nsea-creatures develop, who, having in their youth fins, eyes and\r\nsensitive feelers, become, when once they find their resting-place,\r\nmotionlessly attached to it, losing one after the other, sight,\r\nmovement, and even sensation, everything but the faculty to adhere.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the children were left alone. For sympathy and amusement they\r\nonly had each other to look to; and never were brother and sisters more\r\ndevoted. Maria, the eldest, took care of them all--she was an\r\nold-fashioned, motherly little girl; frail and small in appearance, with\r\nthoughtful, tender ways. She was very careful of her five little ones,\r\nthis seven-year-old mother of theirs, and never seems to have exerted\r\nthe somewhat tyrannic authority usually wielded by such youthful\r\nguardians. Indeed, for all her seniority, she was the untidy one of the\r\nfamily herself; it was against her own faults only that she was severe.\r\nShe must have been a very attaching little creature, with her childish\r\ndelinquencies and her womanly cares; protecting her little family with\r\ngentle love and discussing the debates in Parliament with her father.\r\nCharlotte remembered her to the end of her life with passionate clinging\r\naffection and has left us her portrait in the pathetic figure of Helen\r\nBurns.\r\n\r\nThis delicate, weak-chested child of seven was the head of the nursery.\r\nThen came Elizabeth, less clearly individualised in her sisters' memory.\r\nShe also bore in her tiny body the seeds of fatal consumption. Next\r\ncame impetuous Charlotte, always small and pale. Then red-headed,\r\ntalkative Patrick Branwell. Lastly Emily and Anne, mere babies, toddling\r\nwith difficulty over the paven path to the moors.\r\n\r\nSuch a family demanded the closest care, the most exact attention. This\r\nwas perhaps impossible on an income of L200 a year, when the mother lay\r\nupstairs dying of a disease that required constant nursing. Still the\r\nconditions of the Brontes' youth were unnecessarily unhealthy. It could\r\nnot be helped that these delicate children should live on the bleak\r\nwind-swept hill where consumption is even now a scourge; it could not be\r\nhelped that their home was bounded on two sides by the village\r\ngraveyard; it could not be helped that they were left without a mother\r\nin their babyhood; but never, short of neglect, were delicate children\r\nless considered.\r\n\r\nThe little ones, familiar with serious illness in the house, expected\r\nsmall indulgence. They were accustomed to think nothing so necessary as\r\nthat they should amuse themselves in quiet, and keep out of the way. The\r\nlesson learned so young remained in the minds of the five sisters all\r\ntheir lives. From their infancy they were retired and good; it was only\r\nPatrick Branwell who sometimes showed his masculine independence by a\r\nburst of natural naughtiness. They were the quietest of children by\r\nnature and necessity. The rooms at Haworth Parsonage were small and few.\r\nThere were in front two moderate-sized parlours looking on the garden,\r\nthat on the right being Mr. Bronte's study, and the larger one opposite\r\nthe family sitting-room. Behind these was a sort of empty store-room and\r\nthe kitchens. On the first floor there was a servants'-room, where the\r\ntwo servants slept, over the back premises; and a bedroom over each of\r\nthe parlours. Between these and over the entrance passage was a tiny\r\nslip of a room, scarcely larger than a linen-closet, scarcely wider than\r\nthe doorway and the window-frame that faced each other at either end.\r\nDuring the last months of Mrs. Bronte's illness, when it became\r\nnecessary that she should have a bedroom to herself, all the five little\r\ngirls were put to sleep in this small and draughty closet, formerly the\r\nchildren's study. There can scarcely have been room to creep between\r\ntheir beds. Very quiet they must have been; for any childish play would\r\nhave disturbed the dying mother on the one side, and the anxious\r\nirritable father on the other. And all over the house they must keep the\r\nsame hushed calm, since the low stone-floored rooms would echo any\r\nnoise. Very probably they were not unhappy children for all their\r\nquietness. They enjoyed the most absolute freedom, dearest possession of\r\nchildhood. When they were tired of reading the papers (they seemed to\r\nhave had no children's books), or of discussing the rival merits of\r\nBonaparte and the Duke of Wellington, they were free to go along the\r\npaven way over the three fields at the back, till the last steyle-hole\r\nin the last stone wall let them through on to the wide and solitary\r\nmoors. There in all weathers they might be found; there they passed\r\ntheir happiest hours, uncontrolled as the birds overhead.\r\n\r\nOne rule seems to have been made by their father for the management of\r\nthese precocious children with their consumptive taint, with their\r\nmother dying of cancer--that one rule of Mr. Bronte's making, still\r\npreserved to us, is that the children should eat no meat. The Rev.\r\nPatrick Bronte, B.A., had grown to heroic proportions on potatoes; he\r\nknew no reason why his children should fare differently.\r\n\r\nThe children never grumbled; so Mrs. Bronte's sick-nurse told Mrs.\r\nGaskell:\r\n\r\n     \"You would not have known there was a child in the house,\r\n     they were such still, noiseless, good little creatures.\r\n     Maria would shut herself up in the children's study with a\r\n     newspaper and be able to tell one everything when she came\r\n     out; debates in Parliament, and I don't know what all. She\r\n     was as good as a mother to her sisters and brother. But\r\n     there never were such good children. I used to think them\r\n     spiritless, they were so different to any children I had\r\n     ever seen. In part, I set it down to a fancy Mr. Bronte had\r\n     of not letting them have flesh-meat to eat. It was from no\r\n     wish for saving, for there was plenty and even waste in the\r\n     house, with young servants and no mistress to see after\r\n     them; but he thought that children should be brought up\r\n     simply and hardily: so they had nothing but potatoes for\r\n     their dinner; but they never seemed to wish for anything\r\n     else. They were good little creatures. Emily was the\r\n     prettiest.\"\r\n\r\nThis pretty Emily of two years old was no mother's constant joy. That\r\nearly shaping tenderness, those recurring associations of reverent love,\r\nmust be always missing in her memories. Remembering her earliest\r\nchildhood, she would recall a constant necessity of keeping joys and\r\nsorrows quiet, not letting others hear; she would recall the equal love\r\nof children for each other, the love of the only five children she knew\r\nin all the world; the free wide moors where she might go as she pleased,\r\nand where the rabbits played and the moor-game ran and the wild birds\r\nsang and flew.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bronte's death can have made no great difference to any of her\r\nchildren save Maria, who had been her constant companion at Thornton;\r\nfriendly and helpful as a little maiden of six can be to the worried,\r\ndelicate mother of many babies. Emily and Anne would barely remember her\r\nat all. Charlotte could only just recall the image of her mother playing\r\nwith Patrick Branwell one twilight afternoon. An empty room, a cessation\r\nof accustomed business, their mother's death can have meant little more\r\nthan that to the younger children.\r\n\r\nFor about a year they were left entirely to their own devices, and to\r\nthe rough care of kind-hearted, busy servants. They devised plays about\r\ngreat men, read the newspapers, and worshipped the Duke of Wellington,\r\nstrolled over the moors at their own sweet will, knowing and caring\r\nabsolutely for no creature outside the walls of their own home. To these\r\nfree, hardy, independent little creatures Mr. Bronte announced one\r\nmorning that their maiden aunt from Cornwall, their mother's eldest\r\nsister, was coming to superintend their education.\r\n\r\n     \"Miss Branwell was a very small, antiquated little lady. She\r\n     wore caps large enough for half-a-dozen of the present\r\n     fashion, and a front of light auburn curls over her\r\n     forehead. She always dressed in silk. She had a horror of\r\n     the climate so far north, and of the stone floors in the\r\n     Parsonage.... She talked a great deal of her younger\r\n     days--the gaieties of her dear native town Penzance, the\r\n     soft, warm climate, &c. She gave one the idea that she had\r\n     been a belle among her own home acquaintance. She took snuff\r\n     out of a very pretty gold snuff-box, which she sometimes\r\n     presented to you with a little laugh, as if she enjoyed the\r\n     slight shock of astonishment visible in your countenance....\r\n     She would be very lively and intelligent, and tilt arguments\r\n     against Mr. Bronte without fear.\"\r\n\r\nSo Miss Ellen Nussey recalls the elderly, prim Miss Branwell about ten\r\nyears later than her first arrival in Yorkshire. But it is always said\r\nof her that she changed very little. Miss Nussey's striking picture will\r\npretty accurately represent the maiden lady of forty, who, from a\r\nstringent and noble sense of duty, left her southern, pleasant home to\r\ntake care of the little orphans running wild at Haworth Parsonage. It is\r\neasy to imagine with what horrified astonishment aunt and nieces must\r\nhave regarded each others' peculiarities.\r\n\r\nIt was, no doubt, an estimable advantage for the children to have some\r\nrelated lady in authority over them. Henceforth their time was no longer\r\nfree for their own disposal. They said lessons to their father, they did\r\nsewing with their aunt, and learned from her all housewifely duties. The\r\nadvantage would have been a blessing had their aunt been a woman of\r\nsweet-natured, motherly turn; but the change from perfect freedom to her\r\nold-maidish discipline was not easy to bear--a bitter good, a\r\nstrengthening but disagreeable tonic, making the children yet less\r\nexpansive, yet more self-contained and silent. Patrick Branwell was the\r\nfavourite with his aunt, the naughty, clever, brilliant, rebellious,\r\naffectionate Patrick. Next to him she always preferred the pretty,\r\ngentle baby Anne, with her sweet, clinging ways, her ready submission,\r\nher large blue eyes and clear pink-and-white complexion. Charlotte,\r\nimpulsive, obstinate and plain, the rugged, dogged Emily, were not\r\nframed to be favourites with her. Many a fierce tussle of wills, many a\r\ngrim listening to over-frivolous reminiscence, must have shown the aunt\r\nand her nieces the difference of their natures. Maria, too, the whilom\r\nhead of the nursery, must have found submission hard; but hers was a\r\nsingularly sweet and modest nature. Of Elizabeth but little is\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nMr. Bronte, now that the children were growing out of babyhood, seems\r\nto have taken a certain pride in them. Probably their daily lessons\r\nshowed him the character and talent hidden under those pale and grave\r\nlittle countenances. In a letter to Mrs. Gaskell he recounts instances\r\nof their early talent. More home-loving fathers will smile at the simple\r\nyet theatric means he took to discover the secret of his children's real\r\ndispositions. 'Twas a characteristic inspiration, worthy the originator\r\nof the ancient name of Bronte. A certain simplicity of confidence in his\r\nown subtlety gives a piquant flavour to the manner of telling the\r\ntale:--\r\n\r\n     \"A circumstance now occurs to my mind which I may as well\r\n     mention. When my children were very young, when, as far as I\r\n     can remember, the eldest was about ten years of age and the\r\n     youngest four, thinking that they knew more than I had yet\r\n     discovered, in order to make them speak with less timidity,\r\n     I deemed that if they were put under a sort of cover I might\r\n     gain my end; and happening to have a mask in the house I\r\n     told them all to stand and speak boldly from under cover of\r\n     the mask.\r\n\r\n     \"I began with the youngest (Anne, afterwards Acton Bell),\r\n     and asked what a child like her most wanted; she answered,\r\n     'Age and experience.' I asked the next (Emily, afterwards\r\n     Ellis Bell) what I had best do with her brother Branwell,\r\n     who sometimes was a naughty boy; she answered, 'Reason with\r\n     him; and when he won't listen to reason whip him.' I asked\r\n     Branwell what was the best way of knowing the difference\r\n     between the intellects of men and women; he answered, 'By\r\n     considering the difference between them as to their bodies.'\r\n     I then asked Charlotte what was the best book in the world;\r\n     she answered, 'The Bible.' And what was the next best; she\r\n     answered, 'The book of Nature.' I then asked the next\r\n     (Elizabeth, who seems to have taken Miss Branwell's teaching\r\n     to heart) what was the best mode of education for a woman;\r\n     she answered, 'That which would make her rule her house\r\n     well.' Lastly, I asked the oldest what was the best mode of\r\n     spending time; she answered, 'By laying it out in\r\n     preparation for a happy eternity.' I may not have given\r\n     precisely their words, but I have nearly done so, as they\r\n     have made a deep and lasting impression on my memory. The\r\n     substance, however, was exactly what I have stated.\"\r\n\r\nThe severely practical character of Emily's answer is a relief from the\r\nunchildish philosophy of Branwell, Maria, and the baby. A child of four\r\nyears old who prefers age and experience to a tartlet and some sweets\r\nmust be an unnatural product. But the Brontes seem to have had no\r\nchildhood; unlimited discussion of debates, long walks without any\r\nplayfellows, the free perusal of Methodist magazines, this is the\r\npabulum of their infancy. Years after, when they asked some\r\nschool-children to tea, the clergyman's young daughters had to ask their\r\nlittle scholars to teach them how to play. It was the first time they\r\nhad ever cared to try.\r\n\r\nWhat their childhood had really taught them was the value of their\r\nfather's quaint experiment. They learned to speak boldly from under a\r\nmask. Restrained, enforcedly quiet, assuming a demure appearance to\r\ncloak their passionate little hearts, the five sisters never spoke their\r\ninmost mind in look, word, or gesture. They saved the leisure in which\r\nthey could not play to make up histories, dramas, and fairy tales, in\r\nwhich each let loose, without noise, without fear of check, the fancies\r\nthey never tried to put into action as other children are wont to.\r\nCharlotte wrote tales of heroism and adventure. Emily cared more for\r\nfairy tales, wild, unnatural, strange fancies, suggested no doubt in\r\nsome degree by her father's weird Irish stories. Already in her nursery\r\nthe peculiar bent of her genius took shape.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the regular outer life went on--the early rising, the dusting\r\nand pudding-making, the lessons said to their father, the daily portion\r\nof sewing accomplished in Miss Branwell's bedroom, because that lady\r\ngrew more and more to dislike the flagged flooring of the sitting-room.\r\nEvery day, some hour snatched for a ramble on the moors; peaceful times\r\nin summer when the little girls took their sewing under the stunted\r\nthorns and currants in the garden, the clicking sound of Miss Branwell's\r\npattens indistinctly heard within. Happy times when six children, all in\r\nall to each other, told wonderful stories in low voices for their own\r\nentrancement. Then, one spring, illness in the house; the children\r\nsuffering a complication of measles and whooping-cough. They never had\r\nsuch happy times again, for it was thought better that the two elders\r\nshould go away after their sickness; should get their change of air at\r\nsome good school. Mr. Bronte made inquiries and heard of an institution\r\nestablished for clergymen's daughters at Cowan's Bridge, a village on\r\nthe high road between Leeds and Kendal. After some demurring the school\r\nauthorities consented to receive the children, now free from infection,\r\nthough still delicate and needing care. Thither Mr. Bronte took Maria\r\nand Elizabeth in the July of 1824. Emily and Charlotte followed in\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCOWAN'S BRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It was in the year 1823 that the school for clergymen's daughters was\r\nfirst projected. The place was only then contemplated as desirable in\r\nitself, and as a place which might probably be feasible at some distant\r\nday. The mention of it, however, to only two friends in the South having\r\nmet with their warm approbation and a remittance of L70, an opening\r\nseemed to be made for the commencement of the work.\r\n\r\n\"With this sum in hand, in a reliance upon Him who has all hearts at his\r\ndisposal, and to whom belong the silver and the gold, the premises at\r\nCowan's Bridge were purchased, the necessary repairs and additions\r\nproceeded with, and the school was furnished and opened in the spring of\r\n1824. The whole expense of the purchase and outfit amounted to L2333\r\n17_s._ 9_d._\r\n\r\n\"The scanty provision of a large portion of the clergy of the\r\nEstablished Church has long been a source of regret; and very efficient\r\nmeans have been adopted in various ways to remedy it. The sole object of\r\nthe Clergy Daughters' School is to add, in its measure, to these means,\r\nby placing a good female education within reach of the poorest clergy.\r\nAnd by them the seasonable aid thus afforded has been duly appreciated.\r\nThe anxiety and toil which necessarily attend the management of such an\r\ninstitution have been abundantly repaid by the gratitude which has been\r\nmanifested among the parents of the pupils.\r\n\r\n\"It has been a very gratifying circumstance that the Clergy Daughters'\r\nSchool has been enabled to follow up the design of somewhat kindred\r\ninstitutions in London. Pupils have come to it as apprentices from the\r\nCorporation of the Sons of the Clergy; and likewise from the Clergy\r\nOrphan School, in which the education is of a limited nature and the\r\npupils are not allowed to remain after the age of sixteen.\r\n\r\n\"The school is situated in the parish of Tunstall, on the turnpike road\r\nfrom Leeds to Kendal, between which towns a coach runs daily, and about\r\ntwo miles from the town of Kirkby Lonsdale.\r\n\r\n\"Each pupil pays L14 a year (half in advance) for clothing, lodging,\r\nboarding, and educating; L1 entrance towards the expense of books, and\r\nL3 entrance for pelisses, frocks, bonnets, &c., which they wear all\r\nalike.[2] So that the first payment which a pupil is required to bring\r\nwith her is L11; and the subsequent half-yearly payment L7. If French,\r\nmusic, or drawing is learnt, L3 a year additional is paid for each of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n\"The education is directed according to the capacities of the pupils and\r\nthe wishes of their friends. In all cases the great object in view is\r\ntheir intellectual and religious improvement; and to give that plain and\r\nuseful education which may best fit them to return with respectability\r\nand advantage to their own homes; or to maintain themselves in the\r\ndifferent stations of life to which Providence may call them.\"\r\n\r\n... Here comes some explanation of the treasurer's accounts. Then the\r\nreport recommences:--\r\n\r\n\"Low as the terms are, it has been distressing to discover that in many\r\ncases clergymen who have applied on behalf of their daughters have been\r\nunable to avail themselves of the benefits of the school from the\r\ninadequacy of their means to raise the required payments.\r\n\r\n\"The projectors' object will not be fully realised until the means are\r\nafforded of reducing the terms still lower, in extreme cases, at the\r\ndiscretion of the committee. And he trusts that the time will arrive\r\nwhen, either by legacies or otherwise, the school may be placed within\r\nthe reach of those of the clergy for whom it is specially\r\nintended--namely, the _most_ destitute.\r\n\r\n\"The school is open to the whole kingdom. Donors and subscribers gain\r\nthe first attention in the recommendation of pupils; and the only\r\ninquiry made upon applications for admission is into the really\r\nnecessitous circumstances of the applicant.\r\n\r\n\"There are now ninety pupils in the school (the number that can be\r\naccommodated) and several are waiting for admission.\r\n\r\n\"The school is under the care of Mrs. Harben, as superintendent, eight\r\nteachers, and two under-teachers.\r\n\r\n\"To God belongs the glory of the degree of success which has attended\r\nthis undertaking, and which has far exceeded the most sanguine\r\nexpectations. But the expression of very grateful acknowledgment must\r\nnot be wanting towards the many benefactors who have so readily and so\r\nbountifully rendered their assistance. They have their recompense in the\r\nconstant prayers which are offered up from many a thankful heart for all\r\nwho support this institution.\"\r\n\r\nThus excellently and moderately runs the fourth year's report of the\r\nphilanthropic Gymnase Moronval, evangelical Dotheboys Hall, familiar to\r\nreaders of 'Jane Eyre.' When these congratulations were set in type,\r\nthose horrors of starvation, cruelty, and fever were all accomplished\r\nwhich brought death to many children, and to those that lived an\r\nembittering remembrance of wrong. The two Bronte girls who survived\r\ntheir school days brought from them a deep distrust of human kindness, a\r\ndifficult belief in sincere affection, not natural to their warm and\r\npassionate spirits. They brought away yet more enfeebled bodies, prone\r\nto disease; they brought away the memory of two dear sisters dead. \"To\r\nGod be the glory,\" says the report. Rather, let us pray, to the Rev.\r\nWilliam Carus Wilson.\r\n\r\nThe report quoted above was issued six years after the autumn in which\r\nthe little Brontes were sent to Cowan's Bridge; it was not known then in\r\nwhat terms one of those pale little girls would thank her benefactors,\r\nwould speak of her advantages. She spoke at last, and generations of\r\nreaders have held as filthy rags the righteousness of that institution,\r\nthousands of charitable hearts have beat high with indignation at the\r\nphilanthropic vanity which would save its own soul by the sufferings of\r\nlittle children's tender bodies. Yet by an odd anomaly this ogre\r\nbenefactor, this Brocklehurst, must have been a zealous and\r\nself-sacrificing enthusiast, with all his goodness spoiled by an\r\nimperious love of authority, an extravagant conceit.\r\n\r\nIt was in the first year of the school that the little Bronte girls left\r\ntheir home on the moors for Cowan's Bridge. It was natural that as yet\r\nmany things should go wrong and grate in the unperfected order of the\r\nhouse; equally natural that the children should fail to make excuses:\r\npoor little prisoners pent, shivering and starved, in an unkind asylum\r\nfrom friends and liberty.\r\n\r\nThe school, long and low, more like an unpretending farmhouse than an\r\ninstitution, forms two sides of an oblong. The back windows look out on\r\na flat garden about seventy yards across. Part of the house was\r\noriginally a cottage; the longer part a disused bobbin-mill, once turned\r\nby the stream which runs at the side of the damp, small garden. The\r\nground floor was turned into schoolrooms, the dormitories were above,\r\nthe dining-room and the teachers'-room were in the cottage at the end.\r\nAll the rooms were paved with stone, low-ceiled, small-windowed; not\r\nsuch as are built for growing children, working in large classes\r\ntogether. No board of managers would permit the poorest children of our\r\nLondon streets to work in such ill-ventilated schoolrooms.\r\n\r\nThe bobbin-mill, not built for habitation, was, no doubt, faulty and\r\ninsufficient in drainage. The situation of the house, chosen for its\r\nnearness to the stream, was damp and cold, on a bleak, unsheltered\r\nplain, picturesque enough in summer with the green alders overhanging\r\nthe babbling beck, but in winter bitter chill. In this dreary house of\r\nmachines, the place of the ousted wheels and springs was taken by ninety\r\nhungry, growing little human beings, all dressed alike in the coarse,\r\nill-fitting garments of charity, all taught to look, speak, and think\r\nalike, all commended or held up to reprobation according as they\r\nresembled or diverged from the machines whose room they occupied and\r\nwhose regular, thoughtless movement was the model of their life.\r\n\r\nThese children chiefly owed their excellent education, their miserable\r\nfood and lodging, to the exertions of a rich clergyman from Willingdon,\r\nthe nearest village. The Rev. Carus Wilson was a person of importance in\r\nthe neighbourhood; a person who was looked to in emergencies, who prided\r\nhimself on his prudence, foresight, and efficiency in helping others.\r\nWith this, none the less a man of real and zealous desire to do good, an\r\nenergetic, sentient person capable of seeing evils and devising\r\nremedies. He wished to help: he wished no less that it should be known\r\nhe had helped. Pitying the miserable conditions of many of his\r\nfellow-workers, he did not rest till he had founded a school where the\r\ndaughters of the poor clergy should receive a fair education at a\r\nnominal price. When the money for the school was forthcoming, the\r\nproperty was vested in twelve trustees; Mr. Wilson was one. He was also\r\ntreasurer and secretary. Nearly all the work, the power, the\r\nsupervision, the authority of the affair, he took upon his shoulders. He\r\nwas not afraid of work, and he loved power. He would manage, he would be\r\noverseer, he would guide, arrange, and counsel. So sure did he feel of\r\nhis capacity to move all springs himself, that he seems to have\r\nexercised little pains and less discretion in appointing his\r\nsubordinates. Good fortune sent him a gentle, wise, and noble woman as\r\nsuperintendent; but the other teachers were less capable, some snappish,\r\nsome without authority. The housekeeper, who should have been chosen\r\nwith the greatest care, since in her hands lay the whole management and\r\npreparation of the food of these growing children, was a slovenly,\r\nwasteful woman, taken from Mr. Wilson's kitchen, and much believed in by\r\nhimself. Nevertheless to her door must we lay much of the misery of\r\n\"Lowood.\"\r\n\r\nThe funds were small and somewhat uncertain. Honour and necessity alike\r\ncompelled a certain economy. Mr. Wilson contracted for the meat, flour,\r\nand milk, and frequently himself inspected the supplies. But perhaps he\r\ndid not inspect the kitchen. The \"Lowood\" scholars had many tales to\r\ntell of milk turned sour in dirty pans; of burnt porridge with\r\ndisgusting fragments in it from uncleanly cooking vessels; of rice\r\nboiled in water from the rain-cask, flavoured with dead leaves, and the\r\ndust of the roof; of beef salted when already tainted by decomposition;\r\nof horrible resurrection-pies made of unappetising scraps and rancid\r\nfat. The meat, flour, milk and rice were doubtless good enough when Mr.\r\nWilson saw them, but the starved little school-girls with their\r\ndisappointed hunger had neither the courage to complain nor the\r\nimpartiality to excuse. For the rest, it was not easy to complain to Mr.\r\nWilson. His sour evangelicism led him to the same conclusion as the\r\navarice of a less disinterested Yorkshire schoolmaster; he would have\r\nbade them conquer human nature. Being a very proud man, he sought to\r\ncultivate humility in others. The children were all dressed alike, all\r\nwearing in summer plain straw cottage bonnets, white frocks on Sundays\r\nand nankeen in the week; all wearing in winter purple stuff frocks and\r\npurple pelisses--a serviceable and appropriate raiment which should\r\nallow no envies, jealousies, or flatteries. They should not be vain,\r\nneither should they be greedy. A request for nicer-tasting food would\r\nhave branded the asker with the lasting contempt of the Rev. William\r\nCarus Wilson, trustee, treasurer, and secretary. They were to learn that\r\nit was wrong to like pretty things to wear, nice things to eat, pleasant\r\ngames to play; these little scholars taken half on charity. Mr. Wilson\r\nwas repulsed by the apple-and-pegtop side of a child's nature; he\r\ndeliberately ignored it.\r\n\r\nOnce in this grim, cold, hungry house of charity, there was little hope\r\nof escape. All letters and parcels were inspected by the superintendent;\r\nno friends of the pupils were allowed in the school, except for a short\r\ncall of ceremony. But it is probable that Maria and Elizabeth, sent on\r\nbefore, had no thought of warning their smaller sisters. So destitute of\r\nall experience were they, that probably they imagined all schools like\r\nCowan's Bridge; so anxious to learn, that no doubt they willingly\r\naccepted the cold, hunger, deliberate unkindness, which made their\r\nchildhood anxious and old.\r\n\r\nThe lot fell heaviest on the elder sister, clever, gentle, slovenly\r\nMaria. The principal lesson taught at Cowan's Bridge was the value of\r\nroutine.\r\n\r\nMaria, with her careless ways, ready opinions, gentle loving incapacity\r\nto become a machine, Maria was at discord with every principle of\r\nCowan's Bridge. She incurred the bitter resentment of one of the\r\nteachers, who sought all means of humiliating and mortifying the\r\nsweet-natured, shiftless little creature. When, in September, bright,\r\ntalkative Charlotte and baby Emily came to Cowan's Bridge, they found\r\ntheir idolised little mother, their Maria, the butt, laughingstock and\r\nscapegrace of the school.\r\n\r\nThings were better for the two younger ones, Charlotte, a bright clever\r\nlittle girl, and Emily, the prettiest of the little sisters, \"a darling\r\nchild, under five years of age, quite the pet nursling of the\r\nschool.\"[3] But though at first, no doubt, these two babies were pleased\r\nby the change of scene and the companionship of children, trouble was to\r\nbefall them. Not the mere distasteful scantiness of their food, the mere\r\ncold of their bodies; they saw their elder sister grow thinner, paler\r\nday by day, no care taken of her, no indulgence made for her weakness.\r\nThe poor ill-used, ill-nourished child grew very ill without\r\ncomplaining; but at last even the authorities at Cowan's Bridge\r\nperceived that she was dying. They sent for Mr. Bronte in the spring of\r\n1825. He had not heard of her illness in any of his children's letters,\r\nduly inspected by the superintendent. He had heard no tales of poor\r\nfood, damp rooms, neglect. He came to Cowan's Bridge and saw Maria, his\r\nclever little companion, thin, wasted, dying. The poor father felt a\r\nterrible shock. He took her home with him, away from the three little\r\nsisters who strained their eyes to look after her. She went home to\r\nHaworth. A few days afterwards she died.\r\n\r\nNot many weeks after Maria's death, when the spring made Lowood\r\nbearable, when the three saddened little sisters no longer waked at\r\nnight for the cold, no longer lame with bleeding feet, could walk in the\r\nsunshine and pick flowers, when April grew into May, an epidemic of\r\nsickness came over Cowan's Bridge. The girls one by one grew weak and\r\nheavy, neither scolding nor texts roused them now; instead of spending\r\ntheir play-hours in games in the sweet spring air, instead of picking\r\nflowers or running races, these growing children grew all languid,\r\nflaccid, indolent. There was no stirring them to work or play.\r\nIncreasing illness among the girls made even their callous guardians\r\nanxious at last. Elizabeth Bronte was one of the first to flag. It was\r\nnot the fever that ailed her, the mysterious undeclared fever that\r\nbrooded over the house; her frequent cough, brave spirits, clear colour\r\npointed to another goal. They sent her home in the care of a servant;\r\nand before the summer flushed the scanty borders of flowers on the\r\nnewest graves in Haworth churchyard, Elizabeth Bronte was dead, no more\r\nto hunger, freeze, or sorrow. Her hard life of ten years was over. The\r\nsecond of the Bronte sisters had fallen a victim to consumption.\r\n\r\nDiscipline was suddenly relaxed for those remaining behind at Cowan's\r\nBridge. There was more to eat, for there were fewer mouths to feed;\r\nthere was more time to play and walk, for there were none to watch and\r\nrestrain the eager children, who played, eat, shouted, ran riot, with a\r\ncertain sense of relief, although they knew they were only free because\r\ndeath was in the house and pestilence in the air.\r\n\r\nThe woody hollow of Cowan's Bridge was foggy, unwholesome, damp. The\r\nscholars underfed, cramped, neglected. Their strange indolence and\r\nheaviness grew stronger and stronger with the spring. All at once\r\nforty-five out of the eighty girls lay sick of typhus-fever. Many were\r\nsent home only to die, some died at Cowan's Bridge. All that could, sent\r\nfor their children home. Among the few who stayed in the fever-breeding\r\nhollow, in the contaminated house, where the odours of pastilles and\r\ndrugs blended with, but could not conquer, the faint sickening smell of\r\nfever and mortality, among these abandoned few were Charlotte and Emily\r\nBronte.\r\n\r\nThanks to the free, reckless life, the sunshine, the novel abundance of\r\nfood, the two children did not take the infection. Things, indeed, were\r\nbrighter for them now, or would have been, could the indignant spirit in\r\nthese tiny bodies have forgiven or forgotten the deaths of their two\r\nsisters.\r\n\r\nReform had come to Cowan's Bridge, and with swift strides cleared away\r\nthe old order of things. The site was declared unhealthy; the clothing\r\ninsufficient; the water fetid and brackish. When the doctor who\r\ninspected the school was asked to taste the daily food of the scholars\r\nhe spat it out of his mouth. Everything, everything must be altered. It\r\nwas a time of sore and grievous humiliation to Mr. Wilson. He had felt\r\nno qualms, no doubts; he had worked very hard, he thought things were\r\ngoing very well. The accounts were in excellent order, the education\r\nthorough and good, the system elaborate, the girls really seemed to be\r\nacquiring a meek and quiet spirit; and, to quote the prospectus, \"the\r\ngreat object in view is their intellectual and religious improvement.\"\r\nThen stepped in unreckoned-with disease, and the model institution\r\nbecame a by-word of reproach to the county and the order to which it\r\nbelonged. People, however, were not unjust to the influential and\r\nwealthy treasurer, trustee, and secretary. They admitted his energy,\r\nfinancial capacities, and turn for organisation. All they did was to\r\nqualify the rigour of his management. He still continued treasurer, but\r\nthe funds were entrusted to a committee. He kept his post of inspector,\r\nbut assistants were appointed to share his responsibilities. The school\r\nwas given in charge to a new housekeeper; larger and better rations of\r\nfood were given out. Finally a subscription was set on foot to build a\r\nbetter house in a healthier spot. When Charlotte and Emily Bronte went\r\nhome for the midsummer holidays, reform was in full swing at Cowan's\r\nBridge.\r\n\r\nThey went home, two out of the four children who had left their happy\r\nhome six months before. They went home to find no motherly Maria, no\r\nsturdy, patient Elizabeth. The walks on the moors, the tales under the\r\nthorn-trees must henceforth be incomplete. The two elders of that little\r\nband were no longer to be found in house or garden--they lay quiet under\r\na large paving-stone close to the vicarage pew at church. The three\r\nlittle sisters, the one little brother, must have often thought on their\r\nquiet neighbours when the sermon was very long. Thus early familiarised\r\nand neighbourly with death, one of them at least, tall, courageous\r\nEmily, grew up to have no dreary thoughts of it, neither any dreams of\r\na far-off heaven.\r\n\r\nWhen the holidays were over, the two sisters returned to school. Their\r\nfather, strangely enough, had no fear to send them to that fatal place.\r\nTheir aunt, with her two favourites at home, was not over-anxious.\r\nCharlotte and Emily went back to Cowan's Bridge. But before the winter\r\nthey were ill: the damp air, the unhealthy site (for as yet the new\r\nhouse was not built) brought out the weakness of their constitutions.\r\nBearing the elder sisters' fate in view, the authorities warned Mr.\r\nBronte, and the two children came home to Haworth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It is very much wished that the pupils should wear only\r\ntheir school dress during the vacations.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mrs. Harben to Mrs. Gaskell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCHILDHOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe home to which Charlotte and Emily returned was not a very much more\r\nhealthy spot than that they left; but it was home. It was windy and\r\ncold, and badly drained. Mr. Bronte was ever striving to stir up his\r\nparishioners to improve the sanitary conditions of the place; but for\r\nmany years his efforts were in vain. The canny Yorkshire folk were loth\r\nto put their money underground, and it was hard to make them believe\r\nthat the real cause of the frequent epidemics and fevers in Haworth was\r\nsuch as could be cured by an effective system of subsoil drainage. It\r\nwas cheaper and easier to lay the blame at the doors of Providence. So\r\nthe parson preached in vain. Well might he preach, for his own house was\r\nin the thick of the evil.\r\n\r\n\"As you left the Parsonage-gate you looked upon the stonecutter's\r\nchipping-shed, which was piled with slabs ready for use, and to the ear\r\nthere was the incessant 'chip, chip' of the recording chisel as it\r\ngraved in the 'In Memoriams' of the departed.\"\r\n\r\nSo runs Miss Nussey's manuscript. She also tells of the constant sound\r\nof the passing bell; of the frequent burials in the thronged churchyard.\r\nNo cheerful, healthy home for sensitive, delicate children.\r\n\r\n\"From the Parsonage windows the first view was the plot of grass edged\r\nby a wall, a thorn-tree or two, and a few shrubs and currant-bushes that\r\ndid not grow. Next to these was the large and half-surrounding\r\nchurchyard, so full of gravestones that hardly a strip of grass could be\r\nseen in it.\"\r\n\r\nBeyond this the moors, the wild, barren, treeless moors, that stretch\r\naway for miles and miles, feeding a few herds of mountain sheep,\r\nharbouring some wild conies and hares, giving a nesting-place to the\r\nbirds of heaven, and, for the use of man, neither grain nor pasturage,\r\nbut quarries of stone and piles of peat luridly smouldering up there on\r\nautumn nights.\r\n\r\nSuch is the home to which Emily Bronte clung with the passionate love of\r\nthe Swiss for his white mountains, with a homesickness in absence that\r\nstrained the very cords of life. Yet her childhood in that motherless\r\nhome had few of the elements of childish happiness, and its busy\r\nstrictness of daily life was saddened by the loss of Maria and\r\nElizabeth, dear, never-forgotten playfellows. Charlotte, now the eldest\r\nof the family, was only two years older than Emily, but her sense of\r\nresponsibility made her seem quite of a different age. It was little\r\nAnne who was Emily's companion--delicate, shrinking, pretty Anne, Miss\r\nBranwell's favourite. Anne could enter only into the easiest or lightest\r\nof her sister's moods, and yet she was so dear that Emily never sought\r\nanother friend. So from childhood she grew accustomed to keep her own\r\nconfidence upon her deepest thoughts and liveliest fancies.\r\n\r\nA quiet regular life--carpet-brushing, sewing, dusting in the morning.\r\nThen some necessary lessons said to their aunt upstairs; then, in the\r\nevening, while Mr. Bronte wrote his sermons in the study and Miss\r\nBranwell sat in her bedroom, the four children, alone in the parlour,\r\nor sitting by the kitchen fire, while Tabby, the servant, moved briskly\r\nabout, would write their magazines or make their plays.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal about politics still in the plays. Mr. Bronte,\r\nwho took a keen interest in the affairs of the world, always told the\r\nchildren the chief public news of the day, and let them read what\r\nnewspapers and magazines they could lay hold on. So the little Brontes\r\nprattled of the Duke of Wellington when other children still have Jack\r\nthe Giantkiller for a hero; the Marquis of Douro was their Prince\r\nCharming; their Yahoos, the Catholics; their potent evil genii the\r\nLiberal Ministry.\r\n\r\n\"Our plays were established,\" says Charlotte, the family chronicler, in\r\nher history of the year 1829: \"'Young Men,' June, 1826; 'Our Fellows,'\r\nJuly, 1827; 'Islanders,' December, 1827. These are our three great plays\r\nthat are not kept secret. Emily's and my best plays were established the\r\n1st of December, 1827; the others, March, 1828. Best plays mean secret\r\nplays; they are very nice ones. All our plays are very strange ones.\r\nTheir nature I need not write on paper, for I think I shall always\r\nremember them. The 'Young Men's' play took its rise from some wooden\r\nsoldiers Branwell had; 'Our Fellows' from AEsop's Fables; and the\r\n'Islanders' from several events which happened. I will sketch out the\r\norigin of our plays more explicitly if I can. First, 'Young Men.' Papa\r\nbought Branwell some wooden soldiers at Leeds; when papa came home it\r\nwas night, and we were in bed, so next morning Branwell came to our\r\ndoor\" (the little room over the passage. Anne slept with her aunt) \"with\r\na box of soldiers. Emily and I jumped out of bed, and I snatched up one\r\nand exclaimed, 'This is the Duke of Wellington! This shall be the\r\nDuke.' When I had said this, Emily likewise took one up and said it\r\nshould be hers; when Anne came down, she said one should be hers. Mine\r\nwas the prettiest of the whole, the tallest and the most perfect in\r\nevery part. Emily's was a grave-looking fellow, and we called him\r\n'Gravey.' Anne's was a queer little thing, much like herself, and we\r\ncalled him 'Waiting-boy.' Branwell chose his, and called him Bonaparte.\"\r\n\r\nIn another play Emily chooses Sir Walter Scott, Mr. Lockhart and Johnny\r\nLockhart as her representatives; Charlotte the Duke of Wellington, the\r\nMarquis of Douro, Mr. Abernethy, and Christopher North. This last\r\npersonage was indeed of great importance in the eyes of the children,\r\nfor _Blackwood's Magazine_ was their favourite reading. On their\r\nfather's shelves were few novels, and few books of poetry. The\r\nclergyman's study necessarily boasted its works of divinity and\r\nreference; for the children there were only the wild romances of\r\nSouthey, the poems of Sir Walter Scott, left by their Cornish mother,\r\nand \"some mad Methodist magazines full of miracles and apparitions and\r\npreternatural warnings, ominous dreams and frenzied fanaticism; and the\r\nequally mad letters of Mrs. Elizabeth Rowe from the Dead to the Living,\"\r\nfamiliar to readers of 'Shirley.' To counterbalance all this romance and\r\nterror, the children had their interest in politics and _Blackwood's\r\nMagazine_, \"the most able periodical there is,\" says thirteen-year-old\r\nCharlotte. They also saw _John Bull_, \"a high Tory, very violent, the\r\n_Leeds Mercury_, _Leeds Intelligencer_, a most excellent Tory\r\nnewspaper,\" and thus became accomplished fanatics in all the burning\r\nquestions of the day.\r\n\r\nMiss Branwell took care that the girls should not lack more homely\r\nknowledge. Each took her share in the day's work, and learned all\r\ndetails of it as accurately as any German maiden at her cookery school.\r\nEmily took very kindly to even the hardest housework; there she felt\r\nable and necessary; and, doubtless, upstairs, grimly listening to prim\r\nMiss Branwell's stories of bygone gaieties, this awkward growing girl\r\nwas glad to remember that she too was of importance to the household,\r\ndespite her tongue-tied brooding.\r\n\r\nThe girls fared well enough; but not so their brother. Branwell's\r\nbrilliant purposelessness, Celtic gaiety, love of amusement and light\r\nheart made him the most charming playfellow, but a very anxious charge.\r\nFriends advised Mr. Bronte to send his son to school, but the peculiar\r\nvanity which made him model his children's youth in all details on his\r\nown forbad him to take their counsel. Since he had fed on potatoes, his\r\nchildren should eat no meat. Since he had grown up at home as best he\r\nmight, why should Patrick Branwell go to school? Every day the father\r\ngave a certain portion of his time to working with his boy; but a\r\nclergyman's time is not his own, and often he was called away on parish\r\nbusiness. Doubtless Mr. Bronte thought these tutorless hours were spent,\r\nas he would have spent them, in earnest preparation of difficult tasks.\r\nBut Branwell, with all his father's superficial charm of manner, was\r\nwithout the underlying strength of will, and he possessed, unchecked,\r\nthe temptations to self-indulgence, to which his father seldom yielded,\r\ncounteracting them rather by an ascetic regimen of life. These long\r\nafternoons were spent, not in work, but in mischievous companionship\r\nwith the wilder spirits of the village, to whom \"t' Vicar's Patrick\" was\r\nthe standard of brilliant leadership in scrapes.\r\n\r\nNo doubt their admiration flattered Branwell, and he enjoyed the noisy\r\nfun they had together. Nevertheless he did not quite neglect his\r\nsisters. Charlotte has said that at this time she loved him even as her\r\nown soul--a serious phrase upon those serious lips. But it was Emily and\r\nBranwell who were most to each other: bright, shallow, exacting brother;\r\nsilent, deep-brooding, unselfish sister, more anxious to give than to\r\nreceive. In January, 1831, Charlotte went to school at Miss Wooler's, at\r\nRoe Head, twenty miles away; and Branwell and Emily were thrown yet more\r\nupon each other for sympathy and entertainment.\r\n\r\nCharlotte stayed a year and a half at school, and returned in the July\r\nof 1832 to teach Emily and Anne what she had learnt in her absence;\r\nEnglish-French, English and drawing was pretty nearly all the\r\ninstruction she could give. Happily genius needs no curriculum.\r\nNevertheless the sisters toiled to extract their utmost boon from such\r\nadvantages as came within their range. Every morning from nine till\r\nhalf-past twelve they worked at their lessons; then they walked together\r\nover the moors, just coming into flower. These moors knew a different\r\nEmily to the quiet girl of fourteen who helped in the housework and\r\nlearned her lessons so regularly at home. On the moors she was gay,\r\nfrolicsome, almost wild. She would set the others laughing with her\r\nquaint humorous sallies and genial ways. She was quite at home there,\r\ntaking the fledgeling birds in her hands so softly that they were not\r\nafraid, and telling stories to them. A strange figure--tall, slim,\r\nangular, with all her inches not yet grown; a quantity of dark-brown\r\nhair, deep beautiful hazel eyes that could flash with passion, features\r\nsomewhat strong and stern, the mouth prominent and resolute.\r\n\r\nThe sisters, and sometimes Branwell, would go far on the moors;\r\nsometimes four miles to Keighley in the hollow over the ridge, unseen\r\nfrom the heights, but brooded over always by a dim film of smoke,\r\nseemingly the steam rising from some fiery lake. The sisters now\r\nsubscribed to a circulating library at Keighley, and would gladly\r\nundertake the rough walk of eight miles for the sake of bringing back\r\nwith them a novel by Scott, or a poem by Southey. At Keighley, too, they\r\nbought their paper. The stationer used to wonder how they could get\r\nthrough so much.\r\n\r\nOther days they went over Stanbury Moor to the Waterfall, a romantic\r\nglen in the heathy side of the hill where a little stream drips over\r\ngreat boulders, and where some slender delicate birches spring, a wonder\r\nin this barren country. This was a favourite haunt of Emily, and indeed\r\nthey all loved the spot. Here they would use some of their paper, for\r\nthey still kept up their old habit of writing tales and poems, and loved\r\nto scribble out of doors. And some of it they would use in drawing,\r\nsince at this time they were taking lessons, and Emily and Charlotte\r\nwere devoted to the art: Charlotte making copies with minuteness and\r\nexact fidelity; Emily drawing animals and still-life with far greater\r\nfreedom and certainty of touch. Some of Charlotte's paper, also, must\r\nhave gone in letter-writing. She had made friends at school, an event of\r\ngreat importance to that narrow circle. One of these friends, the\r\ndearest, was unknown to Haworth. Many a time must Emily and Anne have\r\nlistened to accounts of the pretty, accomplished, lively girl, a\r\nfavourite in many homes, who had won the heart of their shy plain\r\nsister. She was, indeed, used to a very different life, this fair young\r\ngirl, but her bright youth and social pleasures did not blind her to the\r\nfact that oddly-dressed, old-fashioned Charlotte Bronte was the most\r\nremarkable person of her acquaintance. She was the first, outside\r\nCharlotte's home, to discover her true character and genius; and that at\r\nan age, in a position, when most girls would be too busy with visions of\r\na happy future for themselves to sympathise with the strange activities,\r\nthe morbid sensitiveness, of such a mind as Charlotte possessed. But so\r\nearly this girl loved her; and lives still, the last to have an intimate\r\nrecollection of the ways, persons and habits of the Bronte household.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1832, Charlotte left home again on a fortnight's visit to\r\nthe home of this dear friend. Branwell took her there. He had probably\r\nnever been from home before. He was in wild spirits at the beauty of the\r\nhouse and grounds, inspecting, criticising everything, pouring out a\r\nstream of comments, rich in studio terms, taking views in every\r\ndirection of the old battlemented house, and choosing \"bits\" that he\r\nwould like to paint, delighting the whole family with his bright\r\ncleverness, and happy Irish ways. Meanwhile Charlotte looked on, shy and\r\ndull. \"I leave you in Paradise!\" cried Branwell, and betook himself over\r\nthe moor to make fine stories of his visit to Emily and Anne in the bare\r\nlittle parlour at Haworth.\r\n\r\nCharlotte's friend, Ellen, sent her home laden with apples for her two\r\nyoung sisters: \"Elles disent qu'elles sont sur que Mademoiselle E. est\r\ntres-aimable et bonne; l'une et l'autre sont extremement impatientes de\r\nvous voir; j'espere que dans peu de mois elles auront ce plaisir----\" So\r\nwrites Charlotte in the quaint Anglo-French that the friends wrote to\r\neach other for practice. But winter was approaching, and winter is\r\ndreary at Haworth. Miss Branwell persuaded the eager girls to put off\r\ntheir visitor till summer made the moors warm and dry, and beautiful, so\r\nthat the young people could spend much of their time out of doors. In\r\nthe summer of 1833 Ellen came to Haworth.\r\n\r\nMiss Ellen Nussey is the only person living who knew Emily Bronte on\r\nterms of intimate equality, and her testimony carries out that of those\r\nhumbler friends who helped the parson's busy daughter in her cooking and\r\ncleaning; from all alike we hear of an active, genial, warm-hearted\r\ngirl, full of humour and feeling to those she knew, though shy and cold\r\nin her bearing to strangers. A different being to the fierce impassioned\r\nVestal who has seated herself in Emily's place of remembrance.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 Emily was nearly fifteen, a tall long-armed girl, full grown,\r\nelastic of tread; with a slight figure that looked queenly in her best\r\ndresses, but loose and boyish when she slouched over the moors,\r\nwhistling to her dogs, and taking long strides over the rough earth. A\r\ntall, thin, loose-jointed girl--not ugly, but with irregular features\r\nand a pallid thick complexion. Her dark brown hair was naturally\r\nbeautiful, and in later days looked well, loosely fastened with a tall\r\ncomb at the back of her head; but in 1833 she wore it in an unbecoming\r\ntight curl and frizz. She had very beautiful eyes of hazel colour.\r\n\"Kind, kindling, liquid eyes,\" says the friend who survives all that\r\nhousehold. She had an aquiline nose, a large expressive, prominent\r\nmouth. She talked little. No grace or style in dress belonged to Emily,\r\nbut under her awkward clothes her natural movements had the lithe beauty\r\nof the wild creatures that she loved. She was a great walker, spending\r\nall her leisure on the moors. She loved the freedom there, the large\r\nair. She loved the creatures, too. Never was a soul with a more\r\npassionate love of Mother Earth, of every weed and flower, of every\r\nbird, beast, and insect that lived. She would have peopled the house\r\nwith pets had not Miss Branwell kept her niece's love of animals in due\r\nsubjection. Only one dog was allowed, who was admitted into the parlour\r\nat stated hours, but out of doors Emily made friends with all the beasts\r\nand birds. She would come home carrying in her hands some young bird or\r\nrabbit, and softly talking to it as she came. \"Ee, Miss Emily,\" the\r\nyoung servant would say, \"one would think the bird could understand\r\nyou.\" \"I am sure it can,\" Emily would answer. \"Oh, I am sure it can.\"\r\n\r\nThe girls would take their friend [for] long walks on the moor. When\r\nthey went very far, Tabby, their old factotum, insisted on escorting\r\nthem, unless Branwell took that duty on himself, for they were still\r\n\"childer\" in her eyes. Emily and Anne walked together. They and Branwell\r\nwould ford the streams and place stepping-stones for the elder girls. At\r\nevery point of view, at every flower, the happy little party would stop\r\nto talk, admire, and theorise in concert. Emily's reserve had vanished\r\nas morning mists. She was full of glee and gladness, on her own demesne,\r\nno longer awkward and silent. On fine days Emily and Anne would persuade\r\nthe others to walk to the Waterfall which made an island of brilliant\r\ngreen turf in the midst of the heather, set with clear springs, shaded\r\nwith here and there a silver birch, and dotted with grey boulders,\r\nbeautiful resting-places. Here the four girls--the \"quartette\" as they\r\ncalled themselves--would go and sit and listen to Ellen's stories of the\r\nworld they had not seen. Or Emily, half-reclining on a slab of stone,\r\nwould play like a young child with the tadpoles in the water, making\r\nthem swim about, and she would fall to moralising on the strong and the\r\nweak, the brave and the cowardly, as she chased the creatures with her\r\nhand. Having rested, they would trudge home again a merry party, save\r\nwhen they met some wandering villager. Then the parson's three\r\ndaughters would walk on, hushed and timid.\r\n\r\nAt nine the sewing was put by, and the four girls would talk and laugh,\r\npacing round the parlour. Miss Branwell went to bed early, and the young\r\npeople were left alone in the curtainless clean parlour, with its grey\r\nwalls and horse-hair furniture. But with good company no room is poorly\r\nfurnished; and they had much to say, and much to listen to, on nights\r\nwhen Branwell was at home. Oftenest they must have missed him; since,\r\nwhenever a visitor stayed at the \"Black Bull,\" the little inn across the\r\nchurchyard, the landlord would send up for \"T' Vicar's Patrick\" to come\r\nand amuse the guests with his brilliant rhodomontade.\r\n\r\nNot much writing went on in Ellen's presence, but gay discussion, making\r\nof stories, and serious argument. They would talk sometimes of dead\r\nMaria and Elizabeth, always remembered with an intensity of love. About\r\neight o'clock Mr. Bronte would call the household to family prayers: and\r\nan hour afterwards he used to bolt the front door, and go upstairs to\r\nbed, always stopping at the sitting-room with a kindly admonition to the\r\n\"children\" not to be late. At last the girls would stop their chatter,\r\nand retire for the night, Emily giving her bed to the visitor and taking\r\na share of the servants' room herself.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast the next morning Ellen used to listen with shrinking\r\namazement to the stories of wild horror that Mr. Bronte loved to relate,\r\nfearful stories of superstitious Ireland, or barbarous legends of the\r\nrough dwellers on the moors; Ellen would turn pale and cold to hear\r\nthem. Sometimes she marvelled as she caught sight of Emily's face,\r\nrelaxed from its company rigour, while she stooped down to hand her\r\nporridge-bowl to the dog: she wore a strange expression, gratified,\r\npleased, as though she had gained something which seemed to complete a\r\npicture in her mind. For this silent Emily, talking little save in rare\r\nbursts of wild spirits; this energetic housewife, cooking and cleaning\r\nas though she had no other aim in view than the providing for the day's\r\ncomfort; this was the same Emily who at five years of age used to\r\nstartle the nursery with her fantastic fairy stories. Two lives went on\r\nside by side in her heart, neither ever mingling with or interrupting\r\nthe other. Practical housewife with capable hands, dreamer of strange\r\nhorrors: each self was independent of the companion to which it was\r\nlinked by day and night. People in those days knew her but as she\r\nseemed--\"T' Vicar's Emily\"--a shy awkward girl, never teaching in the\r\nSunday school like her sisters, never talking with the villagers like\r\nmerry Branwell, but very good and hearty in helping the sick and\r\ndistressed: not pretty in the village estimation--a \"slinky lass,\" no\r\nprim, trim little body like pretty Anne, nor with Charlotte Bronte's\r\ntaste in dress; just a clever lass with a spirit of her own. So the\r\nvillage judged her. At home they loved her with her strong feelings,\r\nuntidy frocks, indomitable will, and ready contempt for the\r\ncommon-place; she was appreciated as a dear and necessary member of the\r\nhousehold. Of Emily's deeper self, her violent genius, neither friend\r\nnor neighbour dreamed in those days. And to-day it is only this Emily\r\nwho is remembered.\r\n\r\nDays went on, pleasant days of autumn, in which Charlotte and her friend\r\nroamed across the blooming moors, in which Anne and Emily would take\r\ntheir little stools and big desks into the garden, and sit and scribble\r\nunder the currant-bushes, stopping now and then to pluck the ripe fruit.\r\nThen came chill October, bringing cold winds and rain. Ellen went home,\r\nleaving an empty chair in the quartette, leaving Charlotte lonelier, and\r\neven Emily and Anne a little dull. \"They never liked any one as well as\r\nyou,\" says Charlotte.\r\n\r\nWinter came, more than usually unhealthy that year, and the moors behind\r\nthe house were impassable with snow and rain. Miss Branwell continually\r\nbemoaned the warm and flowery winters of Penzance, shivering over the\r\nfire in her bedroom; Mr. Bronte was ill; outside the air was filled with\r\nthe mournful sound of the passing bell. But the four young people\r\nsitting round the parlour hearth-place were not cold or miserable. They\r\nwere dreaming of a happy and glorious future, a great career in Art; not\r\nfor Charlotte, not for Emily or Anne, they were only girls; their dreams\r\nwere for the hope and promise of the house--for Branwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nGOING TO SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily was now sixteen years old, and though the people in the village\r\ncalled her \"t' cleverest o' t' Bronte childer,\" she had little to show\r\nof her cleverness. Her education was as home-made as her gowns, not such\r\nas would give distinction to a governess; and a governess Emily would\r\nhave to be. The Bronte sisters were too severe and noble in their\r\ntheories of life ever to contemplate marriage as a means of livelihood;\r\nbut even worldly sisters would have owned that there was little chance\r\nof impatient Emily marrying at all. She was almost violent in her\r\ndislike of strangers. The first time that Ellen stayed at Haworth,\r\nCharlotte was ill one day and could not go out with her friend. To their\r\nsurprise Emily volunteered to take the stranger a walk over the moors.\r\nCharlotte waited anxiously for their return, fearing some outbreak of\r\nimpatience or disdain on the part of her untamable sister. The two girls\r\nat last came home. \"How did Emily behave?\" asked Charlotte, eagerly,\r\ndrawing her friend aside. She had behaved well; she had shown her true\r\nself, her noble, energetic, truthful soul, and from that day there was a\r\nreal friendship between the gentle Ellen and the intractable Emily; but\r\nnone the less does Charlotte's question reveal in how different a manner\r\nthe girl regarded strangers as a rule. In after days when the curates,\r\nlooking for Mr. Bronte in his study, occasionally found Emily there\r\ninstead, they used to beat such a hasty retreat that it was quite an\r\nestablished joke at the Parsonage that Emily appeared to the outer world\r\nin the likeness of an old bear. She hated strange faces and strange\r\nplaces. Her sisters must have seen that such a temperament, if it made\r\nher unlikely to attract a husband or to wish to attract one, also\r\nrendered her lamentably unfit to earn her living as a governess. In\r\nthose days they could not tell that the defect was incurable, a\r\ncongenital infirmity of nature; and doubtless Charlotte, the wise elder\r\nsister, thought she had found a cure for both the narrow education and\r\nthe narrow sympathies when she suggested that Emily should go to school.\r\nShe writes to her friend in July, 1835:--\r\n\r\n     \"I had hoped to have had the extreme pleasure of seeing you\r\n     at Haworth this summer, but human affairs are mutable, and\r\n     human resolutions must bend to the course of events. We are\r\n     all about to divide, break up, separate. Emily is going to\r\n     school, Branwell is going to London, and I am going to be a\r\n     governess. This last determination I formed myself, knowing\r\n     I should have to take the step sometime, and 'better sune as\r\n     syne,' to use a Scotch proverb; and knowing well that Papa\r\n     would have enough to do with his limited income, should\r\n     Branwell be placed at the Royal Academy and Emily at Roe\r\n     Head. Where am I going to reside? you will ask. Within four\r\n     miles of you, at a place neither of us are unacquainted\r\n     with, being no other than the identical Roe Head mentioned\r\n     above. Yes! I am going to teach in the very school where I\r\n     was myself taught. Miss Wooler made me the offer, and I\r\n     preferred it to one or two proposals of private\r\n     governess-ship which I had before received. I am sad--very\r\n     sad--at the thoughts of leaving home; but\r\n     duty--necessity--these are stern mistresses, who will not be\r\n     disobeyed. Did I not once say you ought to be thankful for\r\n     your independence? I felt what I said at the time, and I\r\n     repeat it now with double earnestness; if anything would\r\n     cheer me it is the idea of being so near you. Surely you and\r\n     Polly will come and see me; it would be wrong in me to doubt\r\n     it; you were never unkind yet. Emily and I leave home on the\r\n     27th of this month; the idea of being together consoles us\r\n     both somewhat, and, truth, since I must enter a situation,\r\n     'My lines have fallen in pleasant places.' I both love and\r\n     respect Miss Wooler.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThe wrench of leaving home, so much dreaded by Charlotte, was yet\r\nsharper to her younger sister, morbidly fearful of strangers, eccentric,\r\nunable to live without wide liberty. To go to school; it must have had a\r\ndreadful sound to that untamable, free creature, happiest alone with the\r\ndogs on the moors, with little sentiment or instinct for friendship; no\r\ndesire to meet her fellows. Emily was perfectly happy at Haworth cooking\r\nthe dinner, ironing the linen, writing poems at the Waterfall, taking\r\nher dog for miles over the moors, pacing round the parlour with her arm\r\nround gentle Anne's waist. Now she would have to leave all this, to\r\nseparate from her dear little sister. But she was reasonable and just,\r\nand, feeling the attempt should be made, she packed up her scanty\r\nwardrobe, and, without repining, set out with Charlotte for Roe Head.\r\n\r\nCharlotte knew where she was going. She loved and respected Miss Wooler;\r\nbut with what anxiety must Emily have looked for the house where she was\r\nto live and not to be at home. At last she saw it, a cheerful, roomy,\r\ncountry house, standing a little apart in a field. There was a wide and\r\npleasant view of fields and woods; but the green prospect was sullied\r\nand marred by the smoke from the frequent mills. Green fields, grey\r\nmills, all told of industry, labour, occupation. There was no wild\r\nstretch of moorland here, no possibility of solitude. I think when Emily\r\nBronte saw the place, she must have known very well she would not be\r\nhappy there.\r\n\r\n\"My sister Emily loved the moors,\" says Charlotte, writing of these days\r\nin the latter solitude--\"flowers brighter than the rose bloomed in the\r\nblackest of the heath for her; out of a sullen hollow in a livid\r\nhillside her mind could make an Eden. She found in the bleak solitude\r\nmany and dear delights; and not the least and best-loved was liberty.\r\nLiberty was the breath of Emily's nostrils; without it she perished. The\r\nchange from her own home to a school, and from her own very noiseless,\r\nvery secluded, but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life to one of\r\ndisciplined routine (though under the kindest auspices) was what she\r\nfailed in enduring. Her nature was here too strong for her fortitude.\r\nEvery morning, when she woke, the visions of home and the moors rushed\r\non her, and darkened and saddened the day that lay before her. Nobody\r\nknew what ailed her but me. I knew only too well. In this struggle her\r\nhealth was quickly broken: her white face, attenuated form, and failing\r\nstrength threatened rapid decline. I felt in my heart she would die if\r\nshe did not go home.\"\r\n\r\nThus looking on, Charlotte grew alarmed. She remembered the death of\r\nMaria and Elizabeth, and feared, feared with anguish, lest this\r\nbest-beloved sister should follow them. She told Miss Wooler of her\r\nfear, and the schoolmistress, conscious of her own kindness and a little\r\nresentful at Emily's distress, consented that the girl should be sent\r\nhome without delay. She did not care for Emily, and was not sorry to\r\nlose her. So in October she returned to Haworth, to the only place where\r\nshe was happy and well. She returned to harder work and plainer living\r\nthan she had known at school; but also to home, liberty, comprehension,\r\nher animals, and her flowers. In her native atmosphere she very soon\r\nrecovered the health and strength that seemed so natural to her swift\r\nspirit; that were, alas, so easily endangered. She had only been at\r\nschool three months.\r\n\r\nEven so short an absence may very grievously alter the aspect of\r\nfamiliar things. Haworth itself was the same; prim, tidy Miss Branwell\r\nstill pattered about in her huge caps and tiny clogs; the Vicar still\r\ntold his horrible stories at breakfast, still fought vain battles with\r\nthe parishioners who would not drain the village, and the women who\r\nwould dry their linen on the tombstones. Anne was still as transparently\r\npretty, as pensive and pious as of old; but over the hope of the house,\r\nthe dashing, clever Branwell, who was to make the name of Bronte famous\r\nin art, a dim, tarnishing change had come. Emily must have seen it with\r\nfresh eyes, left more and more in Branwell's company, when, after the\r\nChristmas holidays, Anne returned with Charlotte to Roe Head.\r\n\r\nThere is in none of Charlotte's letters any further talk of sending\r\nBranwell to the Royal Academy. He earnestly desired to go, and for him,\r\nthe only son, any sacrifice had willingly been made. But there were\r\nreasons why that brilliant unprincipled lad should not be trusted now,\r\nalone in London. Too frequent had been those visits to the \"Black Bull,\"\r\nundertaken, at first, to amuse the travellers from London, Leeds and\r\nManchester, who found their evenings dull. The Vicar's lad was following\r\nthe proverbial fate of parsons' sons. Little as they foreboded the end\r\nin store, greatly as they hoped all his errors were a mere necessary\r\nattribute of manliness, the sisters must have read in his shaken nerves\r\nthe dissipation for which their clever Branwell was already remarkable\r\nin Haworth. It is true that to be sometimes the worse for drink was no\r\nuncommon fault fifty years ago in Yorkshire; but the gradual coarsening\r\nof Branwell's nature, the growing flippancy, the altered health, must\r\nhave given a cruel awakening to his sisters' dreams for his career. In\r\n1836 this deterioration was at the beginning; a weed in bud that could\r\nonly bear a bitter and poisonous fruit. Emily hoped the best; his father\r\ndid not seem to see his danger; Miss Branwell spoiled the lad; and the\r\nvillage thought him a mighty pleasant young gentleman with a smile and a\r\nbow for every one, fond of a glass and a chat in the pleasant parlour of\r\nthe \"Black Bull\" at nights; a gay, feckless, red-haired, smiling young\r\nfellow, full of ready courtesies to all his friends in the village; yet,\r\nnone the less as full of thoughtless cruelties to his friends at home.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, he had nothing to do, and was scarcely to blame if he\r\ncould not devote sixteen hours a day to writing verses for the _Leeds\r\nMercury_, his only ostensible occupation. It seems incredible that Mr.\r\nBronte, who well understood the peculiar temptations to which his son\r\nlay open, could have suffered him to loaf about the village, doing\r\nnothing, month after month, lured into ill by no set purpose, but by a\r\nweak social temper and foolish friends. Yet so it was, and with such\r\ntraining, little hope of salvation could there be for that vain,\r\nsomewhat clever, untruthful, fascinating boy.\r\n\r\nSo things went on, drearily enough in reality, though perhaps more\r\npleasantly in seeming--for Branwell, with his love of approbation and\r\nready affectionateness, took all trouble consistent with self-indulgence\r\nto avoid the noise of his misdemeanours reaching home. Thus things went\r\non till Charlotte returned from Miss Wooler's with little Anne in the\r\nmidsummer holidays of 1836.\r\n\r\nAn interval of happiness to lonely Emily; Charlotte's friend came to the\r\ngrey cold-looking Parsonage, enlivening that sombre place with her gay\r\nyouth and sweet looks. Home with four young girls in it was more\r\nattractive to Branwell than the alluring parlour of the \"Black Bull.\"\r\nThe harvest moon that year can have looked on no happier meeting. \"It\r\nwould not be right,\" says the survivor of those eager spirits, \"to pass\r\nover one record which should be made of the sisters' lives together,\r\nafter their school-days, and before they were broken in health by their\r\nefforts to support themselves, that at this time they had all a taste of\r\nhappiness and enjoyment. They were beginning to feel conscious of their\r\npowers, they were rich in each other's companionship, their health was\r\ngood, their spirits were high, there was often joyousness and mirth;\r\nthey commented on what they read; analysed articles and their writers\r\nalso; the perfection of unrestrained talk and intelligence brightened\r\nthe close of the days which were passing all too swiftly. The evening\r\nmarch in the sitting-room, a constant habit learned at school, kept time\r\nwith their thoughts and feelings, it was free and rapid; they marched in\r\npairs, Emily and Anne, Charlotte and her friend, with arms twined round\r\neach other in child-like fashion, except when Charlotte, in an\r\nexuberance of spirit, would for a moment start away, make a graceful\r\npirouette (though she had never learned to dance) and return to her\r\nmarch.\"\r\n\r\nSo the evenings passed and the days, in happy fashion for a little\r\nwhile. Then Charlotte and Anne went back to Miss Wooler's, and Emily,\r\ntoo, took up the gauntlet against necessity. She was not of a character\r\nto let the distastefulness of any duty hinder her from undertaking it.\r\nShe was very stern in her dealings with herself, though tender to the\r\nerring, and anxious to bear the burdens of the weak. She allowed no one\r\nbut herself to decide what it behoved her to do. She could not see\r\nCharlotte labour, and not work herself. At home she worked, it is true,\r\nharder than servants; but she felt it right not only to work, but to\r\nearn. So, having recovered her natural strength, she left Haworth in\r\nSeptember, and Charlotte writes from school to her friend: \"My sister\r\nEmily has gone into a situation as teacher in a large school near\r\nHalifax. I have had one letter from her since her departure; it gives an\r\nappalling account of her duties; hard labour from six in the morning to\r\neleven at night, with only one half-hour of exercise between. This is\r\nslavery. I fear she can never stand it.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood it, however, all that term; came back to Haworth for a brief\r\nrest at Christmas, and again left it for the hated life she led,\r\ndrudging among strangers. But when spring came back, with its feverish\r\nweakness, with its beauty and memories, to that stern place of exile,\r\nshe failed. Her health broke down, shattered by long-resisted\r\nhomesickness. Weary and mortified at heart, Emily again went back to\r\nseek life and happiness on the wild moors of Haworth.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Mrs. Gaskell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nGIRLHOOD AT HAWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next two years passed very solitarily for Emily at Haworth; the\r\nBrontes were too poor for all to stay at home, and since it was\r\ndefinitely settled that Emily could not live away, she worked hard at\r\nhome while her sisters went out in the world to gain their bread. She\r\nhad no friend besides her sisters; far-off Anne was her only confidant.\r\nOutside her own circle the only person that she cared to meet was\r\nCharlotte's friend Ellen, and, of course, Ellen did not come to Haworth\r\nwhile Charlotte was away. Branwell, too, was absent. His first\r\nengagement was as usher in a school; but, mortified by the boys'\r\nsarcasms on his red hair and \"downcast smallness,\" he speedily threw up\r\nhis situation and returned to Haworth to confide his wounded vanity to\r\nthe tender mercies of the rough and valiant Emily, or to loaf about the\r\nvillage seeking readier consolation.\r\n\r\nThen he went as private tutor to a family in Broughton-in-Furness. One\r\nletter of his thence despatched to some congenial spirit in Haworth,\r\nlong since dead, has been lent to me by the courtesy of Mr. William\r\nWood, one of the last of Branwell's companions, in whose possession the\r\ntorn, faded sheet remains. Much of it is unreadable from accidental\r\nrents and the purposed excision of private passages, and part of that\r\nwhich can be read cannot be quoted; such as it is, the letter is\r\nvaluable as showing what things in life seemed desirable and worthy of\r\nattainment to this much-hoped-in brother of the austere Emily, the\r\ncourageous Charlotte, the pious Anne.\r\n\r\n                               \"Broughton-in-Furness, March 15.\r\n\r\n     \"OLD KNAVE OF TRUMPS,\r\n\r\n     \"Don't think I have forgotten you though I have delayed so\r\n     long in writing to you. It was my purpose to send you a yarn\r\n     as soon as I could find materials to spin one with. And it\r\n     is only just now I have had time to turn myself round and\r\n     know where I am.\r\n\r\n     \"If you saw me now you would not know me, and you would\r\n     laugh to hear the character the people give me. Oh, the\r\n     falsehood and hypocrisy of this world! I am fixed in a\r\n     little town retired by the seashore, embowered in woody\r\n     hills that rise round me, huge, rocky, and capped with\r\n     clouds. My employer is a retired county magistrate and large\r\n     landholder, of a right hearty, generous disposition. His\r\n     wife is a quiet, silent, amiable woman; his sons are two\r\n     fine, spirited lads. My landlord is a respectable surgeon,\r\n     and six days out of seven as drunk as a lord; his wife is a\r\n     bustling, chattering, kind-hearted soul; his daughter--oh!\r\n     death and damnation! Well, what am I? that is, what do they\r\n     think I am?--a most sober, abstemious, patient,\r\n     mild-hearted, virtuous, gentlemanly philosopher, the picture\r\n     of good works, the treasure-house of righteous thought.\r\n     Cards are shuffled under the tablecloth, glasses are thrust\r\n     into the cupboard, if I enter the room. I take neither\r\n     spirit, wine, nor malt liquors. I dress in black, and smile\r\n     like a saint or martyr. Every lady says, 'What a good young\r\n     gentleman is the Postlethwaites' tutor.' This is fact, as I\r\n     am a living soul, and right comfortably do I laugh at them;\r\n     but in this humour do I mean them to continue. I took a\r\n     half-year's farewell of old friend whisky at Kendal the\r\n     night after I [left]. There was a party of gentlemen at the\r\n     Royal Hotel; I joined them and ordered in supper and 'toddy\r\n     as hot as Hell.' They thought I was a physician, and put me\r\n     into the chair. I gave them some toasts of the stiffest sort\r\n     ... washing them down at the same time till the room spun\r\n     round and the candles danced in their eyes. One was a\r\n     respectable old gentleman with powdered head, rosy cheeks,\r\n     fat paunch, and ringed fingers ... he led off with a speech,\r\n     and in two minutes, in the very middle of a grand sentence,\r\n     stopped, wagged his head, looked wildly round, stammered,\r\n     coughed, stopped again, called for his slippers, and so the\r\n     waiter helped him to bed. Next a tall Irish squire and a\r\n     native of the land of Israel began to quarrel about their\r\n     countries, and in the warmth of argument discharged their\r\n     glasses each at his neighbour's throat, instead of his own.\r\n     I recommended blisters, bleeding [here illegible], so I\r\n     flung my tumbler on the floor, too, and swore I'd join old\r\n     Ireland. A regular rumpus ensued, but we were tamed at last,\r\n     and I found myself in bed next morning, with a bottle of\r\n     porter, a glass, and corkscrew beside me. Since then I have\r\n     not tasted anything stronger than milk and water, nor, I\r\n     hope, shall I till I return at Midsummer, when we will see\r\n     about it. I am getting as fat as Prince Win at Springhead\r\n     and as godly as his friend Parson Winterbottom. My hand\r\n     shakes no longer: I write to the bankers at Ulverston with\r\n     Mr. Postlethwaite, and sit drinking tea and talking slander\r\n     with old ladies. As to the young ones, I have one sitting by\r\n     me just now, fair-faced, blue-eyed, dark-haired, sweet\r\n     eighteen. She little thinks the Devil is as near her. I was\r\n     delighted to see thy note, old Squire, but don't understand\r\n     one sentence--perhaps you will know what I mean............\r\n     .......................... How are all about you?

I'll send him a remembrance one of these days.\r\n     But I must talk to some one prettier; so good night, old\r\n     boy. Write directly, and believe me to be thine,\r\n\r\n       \"THE PHILOSOPHER.\"\r\n\r\nBranwell's boasted reformation was not kept up for long. Soon he came\r\nback as heartless, as affectionate, as vain, as unprincipled as ever, to\r\nlaugh and loiter about the steep street of Haworth. Then he went to\r\nBradford as a portrait-painter, and--so impressive is audacity--actually\r\nsucceeded for some months in gaining a living there, although his\r\neducation was of the slenderest, and, judging from the specimens still\r\ntreasured in Haworth, his natural talent on a level with that of the\r\naverage new student in any school of art. His tawny mane, his pose of\r\nuntaught genius, his verses in the poet's corner of the paper could not\r\nfor ever keep afloat this untaught and thriftless portrait-painter of\r\ntwenty. Soon there came an end to his painting there. He disappeared\r\nfrom Bradford suddenly, heavily in debt, and was lost to sight, until\r\nunnerved, a drunkard, and an opium-eater, he came back to home and Emily\r\nat Haworth.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile impetuous Charlotte was growing nervous and weak, gentle Anne\r\nconsumptive and dejected, in their work away from home; and Emily was\r\ntoiling from dawn till dusk with her old servant Tabby for the old aunt\r\nwho never cared for her, and the old father always courteous and\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nThey knew the face of necessity more nearly than any friend's, those\r\nBronte girls, and the pinch of poverty was for their own foot; therefore\r\nwere they always considerate to any that fell into the same plight.\r\nDuring the Christmas holidays of 1837, old Tabby fell on the steep and\r\nslippery street and broke her leg. She was already nearly seventy, and\r\ncould do little work; now her accident laid her completely aside,\r\nleaving Emily, Charlotte, and Anne to spend their Christmas holidays in\r\ndoing the housework and nursing the invalid. Miss Branwell, anxious to\r\nspare the girls' hands and her brother-in-law's pocket, insisted that\r\nTabby should be sent to her sister's house to be nursed and another\r\nservant engaged for the Parsonage. Tabby, she represented, was fairly\r\nwell off, her sister in comfortable circumstances; the Parsonage kitchen\r\nmight supply her with broths and jellies in plenty, but why waste the\r\ngirls' leisure and scanty patrimony on an old servant competent to keep\r\nherself. Mr. Bronte was finally persuaded, and his decision made known.\r\nBut the girls were not persuaded. Tabby, so they averred, was one of the\r\nfamily, and they refused to abandon her in sickness. They did not say\r\nmuch, but they did more than say--they starved. When the tea was served,\r\nthe three sat silent, fasting. Next morning found their will yet stronger\r\nthan their hunger--no breakfast. They did the day's work, and dinner came.\r\nStill they held out, wan and sunk. Then the superiors gave in.\r\n\r\nThe girls gained their victory--no stubborn freak, but the right to make\r\na generous sacrifice, and to bear an honourable burden.\r\n\r\nThat Christmas, of course, there could be no visiting nor the next.\r\nTabby was slow in getting well; but she did not outweary the patience of\r\nher friends.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, Charlotte writes to her old schoolfellow:--\r\n\r\n                               \"December 21, 1839.\r\n\r\n     \"We are at present, and have been during the last month,\r\n     rather busy, as for that space of time we have been without\r\n     a servant, except a little girl to run errands. Poor Tabby\r\n     became so lame that she was at length obliged to leave us.\r\n     She is residing with her sister, in a little house of her\r\n     own, which she bought with her own savings a year or two\r\n     since. She is very comfortable, and wants nothing. As she is\r\n     near we see her very often. In the meantime, Emily and I are\r\n     sufficiently busy, as you may suppose: I manage the ironing\r\n     and keep the rooms clean; Emily does the baking and attends\r\n     to the kitchen. We are such odd animals that we prefer this\r\n     mode of contrivance to having a new face among us. Besides,\r\n     we do not despair of Tabby's return, and she shall not be\r\n     supplanted by a stranger in her absence. I excited aunt's\r\n     wrath very much by burning the clothes the first time I\r\n     attempted to iron; but I do better now. Human feelings are\r\n     queer things; I am much happier blackleading the stoves,\r\n     making the beds, and sweeping the floors at home than I\r\n     should be living like a fine lady anywhere else.\"[5]\r\n\r\nThe year 1840 found Emily, Branwell, and Charlotte all at home together.\r\nUnnerved and dissipated as he was, Branwell was still a welcome presence;\r\nhis gay talk still awakened glad promises in the ambitious and loving\r\nhousehold which hoped all things from him. His mistakes and faults they\r\npardoned; thinking, poor souls, that the strong passions which led him\r\nastray betokened a strong character and not a powerless will.\r\n\r\nIt was still to Branwell that they looked for the fame of the family.\r\nTheir poems, their stories, were to these girls but a legitimate means\r\nof amusement and relief. The serious business of their life was to\r\nteach, to cook, to clean; to earn or save the mere expense of their\r\nexistence. No dream of literary fame gave a purpose to the quiet days of\r\nEmily Bronte. Charlotte and Branwell, more impulsive, more ambitious,\r\nhad sent their work to Southey, to Coleridge, to Wordsworth, in vain,\r\npathetic hope of encouragement, or recognition. Not so the sterner\r\nEmily, to whom expression was at once a necessity and a regret. Emily's\r\nbrain, Emily's locked desk, these and nothing else knew the degree of\r\nher passion, her genius, her power. And yet acknowledged power would\r\nhave been sweet to that dominant spirit.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the immediate difficulty was to earn a living. Even those\r\npatient and courageous girls could not accept the thought of a whole\r\nlifetime spent in dreary governessing by Charlotte and Anne, in solitary\r\ndrudgery by homekeeping Emily. One way out of this hateful vista seemed\r\nnot impossible of attainment. For years it was the wildest hope, the\r\ncherished dream of the author of 'Wuthering Heights' and the author of\r\n'Villette.' And what was this dear and daring ambition?--to keep a\r\nladies' school at Haworth.\r\n\r\nFar enough off, difficult to reach, it looked to them, this paltry\r\ncommon-place ideal of theirs. For the house with its four bedrooms would\r\nhave to be enlarged; for the girls' education, with its Anglo-French and\r\nstumbling music, would have to be adorned by the requisite\r\naccomplishments. This would take time; time and money; two luxuries most\r\nhard to get for the Vicar of Haworth's harassed daughters. They would\r\nsigh, and suddenly stop in their making of plans and drawing up of\r\ncirculars. It seemed so difficult.\r\n\r\nOne person, indeed, might help them. Miss Branwell had saved out of her\r\nannuity of L50 a year. She had a certain sum; small enough, but to\r\nCharlotte and Emily it seemed as potent as the fairy's wand. The\r\nquestion was, would she risk it?\r\n\r\nIt seemed not. The old lady had always chiefly meant her savings for the\r\ndear prodigal who bore her name, and Emily and Charlotte were not her\r\nfavourites. The girls indeed only asked for a loan, but she doubted,\r\nhesitated, doubted again. They were too proud to take an advantage so\r\ngrudgingly proffered; and while their talk was still of what means they\r\nmight employ, while they still painfully toiled through improper French\r\nnovels as \"the best substitute for French conversation,\" they gave up\r\nthe dream for the present, and Charlotte again looked out for a\r\nsituation. Nearly a year elapsed before she found it--a happy year, full\r\nof plans and talks with Emily and free from any more pressing anxiety\r\nthan Anne's delicate health always gave her sisters. Branwell was away\r\nand doing well as station-master at Luddendenfoot, \"set off to seek\r\nhis fortune in the wild, wandering, adventurous, romantic,\r\nknight-errant-like capacity of clerk on the Leeds and Manchester\r\nRailway.\" Ellen came to stay at Haworth in the summer; it was quite\r\nsociable and lively now in the grey house on the moors; for, compelled\r\nby failing health, Mr. Bronte had engaged the help of a curate, and the\r\nHaworth curate brought his clerical friends about the house, to the\r\ngreat disgust of Emily, and the half-sentimental fluttering of pensive\r\nAnne, which laid on Charlotte the responsibility of talking for all\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nIn the holidays when Anne was at home all the old glee and enjoyment of\r\nlife returned. There was, moreover, the curate, \"bonnie, pleasant,\r\nlight-hearted, good-tempered, generous, careless, crafty, fickle, and\r\nunclerical,\" to add piquancy to the situation. \"He sits opposite to Anne\r\nat church, sighing softly, and looking out of the corners of his\r\neyes--and she is so quiet, her look so downcast; they are a picture,\"\r\nsays merry Charlotte. This first curate at Haworth was exempted from\r\nEmily's liberal scorn; he was a favourite at the vicarage, a clever,\r\nbright-spirited, and handsome youth, greatly in Miss Branwell's good\r\ngraces. He would tease and flatter the old lady with such graciousness\r\nas made him ever sure of a welcome; so that his daily visits to Mr.\r\nBronte's study were nearly always followed up by a call in the opposite\r\nparlour, when Miss Branwell would frequently leave her upstairs retreat\r\nand join in the lively chatter. She always presided at the tea-table, at\r\nwhich the curate was a frequent guest, and her nieces would be kept well\r\namused all through the tea hour by the curate's piquant sallies,\r\nbaffling the old lady in her little schemes of control over the three\r\nhigh-spirited girls. None enjoyed the fun more than quiet Emily, always\r\npresent and amused, \"her countenance glimmering as it always did when\r\nshe enjoyed herself,\" Miss Ellen Nussey tells me. Many happy legends,\r\ntoo familiar to be quoted here, record the light heart and gay spirit\r\nthat Emily bore in those untroubled days. Foolish, pretty little stories\r\nof her dauntless protection of the other girls from too pressing\r\nsuitors. Never was duenna so gallant, so gay, and so inevitable. In\r\ncompliment to the excellence of her swashing and martial outside on such\r\noccasions, the little household dubbed her \"The Major,\" a name that\r\nstuck to her in days when the dash and gaiety of her soldiery bearing\r\nwas sadly sobered down, and only the courage and dauntless heart\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nBut in these early days of 1841, Emily was as happy as other healthy\r\ncountry girls in a congenial home. \"She did what we did,\" says Miss\r\nNussey, \"and never absented herself when she could avoid it--life at\r\nthis period must have been sweet and pleasant to her.\" An equal\r\nunchequered life, in which trifles seemed of great importance. We hear\r\nof the little joys and adventures of those days, so faithfully and long\r\nremembered, with a pathetic pleasurableness. So slight they are, and all\r\ntheir colour gone, like pressed roses, though a faint sweetness yet\r\nremains. The disasters when Miss Branwell was cross and in no humour to\r\nreceive her guests; the long-expected excitement of a walk over the\r\nmoors to Keighley where the curate was to give a lecture, the alarm and\r\nflurry when the curate, finding none of the four girls had ever received\r\na valentine, proposed to send one to each on the next Valentine's Day.\r\n\"No, no, the elders would never allow it, and yet it would certainly be\r\nan event to receive a valentine; still, there would be such a lecture\r\nfrom Miss Branwell.\" \"Oh no,\" he said, \"I shall post them at Bradford.\"\r\nAnd to Bradford he walked, ten miles and back again, so that on the\r\neventful 14th of February the anxiously-expected postman brought four\r\nvalentines, all on delicately tinted paper, all enhanced by a verse of\r\noriginal poetry, touching on some pleasant characteristic in each\r\nrecipient. What merriment and comparing of notes! What pleased feigning\r\nof indignation! The girls determined to reward him with a Rowland for\r\nhis Oliver, and Charlotte wrote some rhymes full of fun and raillery\r\nwhich all the girls signed--Emily entering into all this with much\r\nspirit and amusement--and finally despatched in mystery and secret glee.\r\n\r\nAt last this pleasant fooling came to an end. Charlotte advertised for a\r\nplace, and found it. While she was away she had a letter from Miss\r\nWooler, offering Charlotte the goodwill of her school at Dewsbury Moor.\r\nIt was a chance not to be lost, although what inducement Emily and\r\nCharlotte could offer to their pupils it is not easy to imagine. But it\r\nwas above all things necessary to make a home where delicate Anne might\r\nbe sheltered, where homesick Emily could be happy, where Charlotte could\r\nhave time to write, where all might live and work together. Miss\r\nWooler's offer was immediately accepted. Miss Branwell was induced to\r\nlend the girls L100. No answer came from Miss Wooler. Then ambitious\r\nCharlotte, from her situation away, wrote to Miss Branwell at\r\nHaworth[6]:--\r\n\r\n                               \"September 29, 1841.\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Aunt,\r\n\r\n     \"I have heard nothing of Miss Wooler yet since I wrote to\r\n     her, intimating that I would accept her offer. I cannot\r\n     conjecture the reason of this long silence, unless some\r\n     unforeseen impediment has occurred in concluding the\r\n     bargain. Meantime a plan has been suggested and approved by\r\n     Mr. and Mrs. ---- and others which I wish now to impart to\r\n     you. My friends recommend, if I desire to secure permanent\r\n     success, to delay commencing the school for six months\r\n     longer, and by all means to contrive, by hook or by crook,\r\n     to spend the intervening time in some school on the\r\n     Continent. They say schools in England are so numerous,\r\n     competition so great, that without some such step towards\r\n     attaining superiority, we shall probably have a very hard\r\n     struggle and may fail in the end. They say, moreover, that\r\n     the loan of L100, which you have been so kind as to offer\r\n     us, will perhaps not be all required now, as Miss Wooler\r\n     will lend us the furniture; and that, if the speculation is\r\n     intended to be a good and successful one, half the sum, at\r\n     least, ought to be laid out in the manner I have mentioned,\r\n     thereby insuring a more speedy repayment both of interest\r\n     and principal.\r\n\r\n     \"I would not go to France or to Paris. I would go to\r\n     Brussels, in Belgium. The cost of the journey there, at the\r\n     dearest rate of travelling, would be L5, living is there\r\n     little more than half as dear as it is in England, and the\r\n     facilities for education are equal or superior to any place\r\n     in Europe. In half a year I could acquire a thorough\r\n     familiarity with French. I could improve greatly in Italian\r\n     and even get a dash at German; _i.e._ providing my health\r\n     continued as good as it is now....\r\n\r\n     \"These are advantages which would turn to real account when\r\n     we actually commenced a school; and, if Emily could share\r\n     them with me, we could take a footing in the world\r\n     afterwards which we never can do now. I say Emily instead of\r\n     Anne; for Anne might take her turn at some future period, if\r\n     our school answered. I feel certain, while I am writing,\r\n     that you will see the propriety of what I say. You always\r\n     like to use your money to the best advantage. You are not\r\n     fond of making shabby purchases; when you do confer a favour\r\n     it is often done in style; and depend upon it L50 or L100,\r\n     thus laid out, would be well employed. Of course, I know no\r\n     other friend in the world to whom I could apply on this\r\n     subject besides yourself. I feel an absolute conviction that\r\n     if this advantage were allowed us, it would be the making of\r\n     us for life. Papa will perhaps think it a wild and\r\n     ambitious scheme; but who ever rose in the world without\r\n     ambition. When he left Ireland to go to Cambridge University\r\n     he was as ambitious as I am now.\"\r\n\r\nThat was true. It must have struck a vibrant chord in the old man's\r\nbreast. Absorbed in parish gossip and his 'Cottage Poems,' caring no\r\nlonger for the world but only for newspaper reports of it, actively\r\nidle, living a resultless life of ascetic self-indulgence, the Vicar of\r\nHaworth was very proud of his energetic past. He had always held it up\r\nto his children as a model for them to copy. Charlotte's appeal would\r\ncertainly secure her father as an ally to her cause. Miss Branwell, on\r\nthe other hand, would not wish for displays of ambition in her already\r\ntoo irrepressible nieces. But she was getting old; it would be a comfort\r\nto her, after all, to see them settled, and prosperously settled through\r\nher generosity. \"I look to you, Aunt, to help us. I think you will not\r\nrefuse,\" Charlotte had said. How, indeed, could Miss Branwell, living in\r\ntheir home, be happy, and refuse?\r\n\r\nYet many discussions went on before anxious Charlotte got the answer.\r\nEmily, whom it concerned as nearly, must have listened waiting in a\r\nstrange perturbation of hope and fear. To leave home--she knew well what\r\nit meant. Since she was six years old she had never left Yorkshire; but\r\nthose months of wearying homesickness at Roe Head, at Halifax, must have\r\nmost painfully rushed back upon her memory. Haworth was health, content,\r\nthe very possibility of existence to this girl. To leave Haworth for a\r\nstrange town beyond the seas, to see strange faces all round, to hear\r\nand speak a strange language, Charlotte's welcome prospect of adventure\r\nmust have taken a nightmare shape to Emily. And for this she must hope;\r\nthis she must desire, plead for if necessary, and at least uphold. For\r\nCharlotte said the thing was essential to their future; and in all\r\ndetails of management, Charlotte's word was law to her sisters. Even\r\nEmily, the independent, indomitable Emily, so resolute in keeping to any\r\nchosen path, looked to Charlotte to choose the way in practical affairs.\r\n\r\nAt length consent was secured, written and despatched. Gleeful Charlotte\r\ngave notice to her employers and soon set out for home. There was much\r\nto be done. \"Letters to write to Brussels, to Lille and to London, lots\r\nof work to be done, besides clothes to repair.\" It was decided that the\r\nsisters should give up their chance of the school at Dewsbury Moor,\r\nsince the site was low and damp, and had not suited Anne. On their\r\nreturn from Brussels they were to set up a school in some healthy\r\nseaside place in the East Riding. Burlington was the place where their\r\nfancy chiefly dwelt. To this beautiful and healthy spot, fronting the\r\nsea, eager pupils would flock for the benefit of instruction by three\r\ndaughters of a clergyman, \"educated abroad\" (for six months) speaking\r\nthorough French, improved Italian and a dash of German. A scintillating\r\nprogramme of accomplishment danced before their eyes.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, many practical difficulties to be vanquished first.\r\nThe very initial step, the choice of a school, was hard to take.\r\nCharlotte writes to Ellen:--\r\n\r\n                               \"January 20, 1842.\r\n\r\n     \"We expect to leave England in about three weeks, but we are\r\n     not yet certain as to the day, as it will depend on the\r\n     convenience of a French lady now in London, Madame Marzials,\r\n     under whose escort we are to sail. Our place of destination\r\n     is changed. Papa received an unfavourable account from Mr.\r\n     or rather from Mrs. Jenkins of the French schools in\r\n     Bruxelles, representing them as of an inferior caste in many\r\n     respects. On further inquiry an institution at Lille in the\r\n     North of France was highly recommended by Baptist Noel and\r\n     other clergymen, and to that place it is decided that we are\r\n     to go. The terms are L50 a year for each pupil for board and\r\n     French alone; but a separate room will be allowed for this\r\n     sum; without this indulgence they are something lower. I\r\n     considered it kind in aunt to consent to an extra sum for a\r\n     separate room. We shall find it a great privilege in many\r\n     ways. I regret the change from Bruxelles to Lille on many\r\n     accounts.\"\r\n\r\nFor Charlotte to regret the change was for an improvement to be\r\ndiscovered. She had set her heart on going to Brussels; Mrs. Jenkins\r\nredoubled her efforts and at length discovered the Pensionnat of Madame\r\nHeger in the Rue d'Isabelle.\r\n\r\nThither, as all the world is aware, Charlotte and Emily Bronte, both of\r\nage, went to school.\r\n\r\n\"We shall leave England in about three weeks.\" The words had a ring of\r\nhappy daring in Charlotte's ears. Since at six years of age she had set\r\nout alone to discover the Golden City, romance, discovery, adventure,\r\nwere sweet promises to her. She had often wished to see the world; now\r\nshe will see it. She had thirsted for knowledge; here is the source. She\r\nlonged to add new notes to that gamut of human character which she could\r\nplay with so profound a science; she shall make a masterpiece out of her\r\nacquisitions. At this time her letters are full of busy gaiety, giving\r\naccounts of her work, making plans, making fun. As happy and hopeful a\r\nyoung woman as any that dwells in Haworth parish.\r\n\r\nEmily is different. It is she who imagined the girl in heaven who broke\r\nher heart with weeping for earth, till the angels cast her out in anger,\r\nand flung her into the middle of the heath, to wake there sobbing for\r\njoy. She did not care to know fresh people; she hates strangers; to walk\r\nwith her bulldog, Keeper, over the moors is her best adventure. To learn\r\nnew things is very well, but she prizes above everything originality and\r\nthe wild provincial flavour of her home. What she strongly, deeply loves\r\nis her moorland home, her own people, the creatures on the heath, the\r\ndogs who always feed from her hands, the flowers in the bleak garden\r\nthat only grow at all because of the infinite care she lavishes upon\r\nthem. The stunted thorn under which she sits to write her poems, is more\r\nbeautiful to her than the cedars of Lebanon. To each and all of these\r\nshe must now bid farewell. It is in a different tone that she says in\r\nher adieus, \"We shall leave England in about three weeks.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Mrs. Gaskell.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Mrs. Gaskell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nIN THE RUE D'ISABELLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rue d'Isabelle had a character of its own. It lies below your feet\r\nas you stand in the Rue Royale, near the statue of General Beliard. Four\r\nflights of steps lead down to the street, half garden, half old houses,\r\nwith at one end a large square mansion, owning the garden that runs\r\nbehind it and to the right of it. The house is old; a Latin inscription\r\nshows it to have been given to the great Guild of Cross-bowmen by Queen\r\nIsabelle in the early years of the 17th century. The garden is older;\r\nlong before the Guild of the Cross-bowmen of the Great Oath, in\r\ndeference to the wish of Queen Isabelle, permitted the street to be made\r\nthrough it, the garden had been their exercising place. There Isabelle\r\nherself, a member of their order, had shot down the bird. But the garden\r\nhad a yet more ancient past; when apple-trees, pear-trees and alleys of\r\nBruges cherries, when plots of marjoram and mint, of thyme and\r\nsweet-basil, filled the orchard and herbary of the Hospital of the Poor.\r\nAnd the garden itself, before trees or flowers were planted, had\r\nresounded with the yelp of the Duke's hounds, when, in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, it had been the Fosse-aux-chiens. This historic garden, this\r\nmansion, built by a queen for a great order, belonged in 1842 to\r\nMonsieur and Madame Heger, and was a famous Pensionnat de Demoiselles.\r\n\r\nThere the Vicar of Haworth brought his two daughters one February day,\r\nspent one night in Brussels and went straight back to his old house on\r\nthe moors, so modern in comparison with the mansion in Rue d'Isabelle.\r\nA change, indeed, for Emily and Charlotte. Even now, Brussels (the\r\nheadquarters of Catholicism far more than modern Rome) has a taste\r\nfor pageantry that recalls mediaeval days. The streets decked with\r\nboughs and strewn with flowers, through which pass slowly the\r\nprocessions of the Church, white-clad children, boys like angels\r\nscattering roses, standard-bearers with emblazoned banners. Surpliced\r\nchoristers singing Latin praises, acolytes in scarlet swinging censers,\r\nreliquaries and images, before which the people fall down in prayer;\r\nall this to-day is no uncommon sight in Brussels, and must have been\r\nyet more frequent in 1842.\r\n\r\nThe flower-market out of doors, with clove-pinks, tall Mary-lilies and\r\ndelicate _roses d'amour_, filling the quaint mediaeval square before the\r\nbeautiful old facade of the Hotel de Ville. Ste.-Gudule with its spires\r\nand arches; the Montagne de la Cour (almost as steep as Haworth street),\r\nits windows ablaze at night with jewels; the little, lovely park, its\r\ngreat elms just coming into leaf, its statues just bursting from their\r\nwinter sheaths of straw; the galleries of ancient pictures, their walls\r\na sober glory of colours, blues, deep as a summer night, rich reds,\r\nbrown golds, most vivid greens.\r\n\r\nAll this should have made an impression on the two home-keeping girls\r\nfrom Yorkshire; and Charlotte, indeed, perceived something of its beauty\r\nand strangeness. But Emily, from a bitter sense of exile, from a natural\r\nnarrowness of spirit, rebelled against it all as an insult to the memory\r\nof her home--she longed, hopelessly, uselessly, for Haworth. The two\r\nBrontes were very different to the Belgian school-girls in Madame\r\nHeger's Pensionnat. They were, for one thing, ridiculously old to be at\r\nschool--twenty-four and twenty-six--and they seemed to feel their\r\nposition; their speech was strained and odd; all the \"sceptical, wicked,\r\nimmoral French novels, over forty of them, the best substitute for\r\nFrench conversation to be met with,\" which the girls had toiled through\r\nwith so much singleness of spirit, had not cured the broadness of their\r\naccent nor the artificial idioms of their Yorkshire French. Monsieur\r\nHeger, indeed, considered that they knew no French at all. Their\r\nmanners, even among English people, were stiff and prim; the hearty,\r\nvulgar, genial expansion of their Belgian schoolfellows must have made\r\nthem seem as lifeless as marionettes. Their dress--Haworth had permitted\r\nitself to wonder at the uncouthness of those amazing leg-of-mutton\r\nsleeves (Emily's pet whim in and out of fashion), at the ill-cut\r\nlankness of those skirts, clumsy enough on round little Charlotte, but a\r\nvery caricature of mediaevalism on Emily's tall, thin, slender figure.\r\nThey knew they were not in their element and kept close together, rarely\r\nspeaking. Yet Monsieur Heger, patiently watching, felt the presence of a\r\nstrange power under those uncouth exteriors.\r\n\r\nAn odd little man of much penetration, this French schoolmaster. \"_Homme\r\nde zele et de conscience, il possede a un haut degre l'eloquence du bon\r\nsens et du coeur._\" Fierce and despotic in the exaction of obedience,\r\nyet tender of heart, magnanimous and tyrannical, absurdly vain and\r\nabsolutely unselfish. His wife's school was a kingdom to him; he brought\r\nto it an energy, a zeal, a faculty of administration worthy to rule a\r\nkingdom. It was with the delight of a botanist discovering a rare plant\r\nin his garden, of a politician detecting a future statesman in his\r\nnursery, that he perceived the unusual faculty which lifted his two\r\nEnglish pupils above their schoolfellows. He watched them silently for\r\nsome weeks. When he had made quite sure, he came forwards and, so to\r\nspeak, claimed them for his own.\r\n\r\nCharlotte at once accepted the yoke. All that he set her to do she\r\ntoiled to accomplish; she followed out his trains of thought; she\r\nadopted the style he recommended; she gave him in return for all his\r\npains the most unflagging obedience, the affectionate comprehension of a\r\nlarge intelligence. She writes to Ellen of her delight in learning and\r\nserving: \"It is very natural to me to submit, very unnatural to\r\ncommand.\"\r\n\r\nNot so with Emily. The qualities which her sister understood and\r\naccepted, irritated her unspeakably. The masterfulness in little things,\r\nthe irritability, the watchfulness of the fiery little professor of\r\nrhetoric were utterly distasteful to her. She contradicted his theories\r\nto his face; she did her lessons well, but as she chose to do them. She\r\nwas as indomitable, fierce, unappeasable, as Charlotte was ready and\r\nsubmissive. And yet it was Emily who had the larger share of Monsieur\r\nHeger's admiration. Egotistic and exacting he thought her, who never\r\nyielded to his petulant, harmless egoism, who never gave way to his\r\nbenevolent tyranny; but he gave her credit for logical powers, for a\r\ncapacity for argument unusual in a man, and rare, indeed, in a woman.\r\nShe, not Charlotte, was the genius in his eyes, although he complained\r\nthat her stubborn will rendered her deaf to all reason, when her own\r\ndetermination, or her own sense of right, was concerned. He fancied she\r\nmight be a great historian, so he told Mrs. Gaskell. \"Her faculty of\r\nimagination was such, her views of scenes and characters would have\r\nbeen so vivid and so powerfully expressed, and supported by such a show\r\nof argument that it would have dominated over the reader, whatever might\r\nhave been his previous opinions or his cooler perception of the truth.\r\nShe should have been a man: a great navigator!\" cried the little, dark,\r\nenthusiastic rhetorician. \"Her powerful reason would have deduced new\r\nspheres of discovery from the knowledge of the old; and her strong\r\nimperious will would never have been daunted by opposition or\r\ndifficulty; never have given way but with life!\"\r\n\r\nYet they were never friends; though Monsieur Heger could speak so well\r\nof Emily at a time, be it remembered, when it was Charlotte's praises\r\nthat were sought, when Emily's genius was set down as a lunatic's\r\nhobgoblin of nightmare potency. He and she were alike too imperious, too\r\nindependent, too stubborn. A couple of swords, neither of which could\r\nserve to sheathe the other.\r\n\r\nThat time in Brussels was wasted upon Emily. The trivial characters\r\nwhich Charlotte made immortal merely annoyed her. The new impressions\r\nwhich gave another scope to Charlotte's vision were nothing to her. All\r\nthat was grand, remarkable, passionate, under the surface of that\r\nconventional Pensionnat de Demoiselles, was invisible to Emily.\r\nNotwithstanding her genius she was very hard and narrow.\r\n\r\nPoor girl, she was sick for home. It was all nothing to her, less than a\r\ndream, this place she lived in. Charlotte's engrossment in her new life,\r\nher eagerness to please her master, was a contemptible weakness to this\r\nembittered heart. She would laugh when she found her elder sister trying\r\nto arrange her homely gowns in the French taste, and stalk silently\r\nthrough the large schoolrooms with a fierce satisfaction in her own\r\nugly sleeves, in the Haworth cut of her skirts. She seldom spoke a word\r\nto any one; only sometimes she would argue with Monsieur Heger, perhaps\r\nsecretly glad to have the chance of shocking Charlotte. If they went out\r\nto tea, she would sit still on her chair, answering \"Yes\" and \"No;\"\r\ninert, miserable, with a heart full of tears. When her work was done she\r\nwould walk in the Cross-bowmen's ancient garden, under the trees,\r\nleaning on her shorter sister's arm, pale, silent--a tall, stooping\r\nfigure. Often she said nothing at all. Charlotte, also, was very\r\nprofitably speechless; under her eyes 'Villette' was taking shape. But\r\nEmily did not think of Brussels. She was dreaming of Haworth.\r\n\r\nOne poem that she wrote at this time may appropriately be quoted here.\r\nIt was, Charlotte tells us, \"composed at twilight, in the schoolroom,\r\nwhen the leisure of the evening play-hour brought back, in full tide,\r\nthe thoughts of home:\"\r\n\r\n    \"A little while, a little while,\r\n      The weary task is put away,\r\n    And I can sing and I can smile\r\n      Alike, while I have holiday.\r\n\r\n    \"Where wilt thou go, my harassed heart--\r\n      What thought, what scene invites thee now?\r\n    What spot, or near or far apart,\r\n      Has rest for thee, my weary brow?\r\n\r\n    \"There is a spot mid barren hills,\r\n      Where winter howls and driving rain;\r\n    But, if the dreary tempest chills,\r\n      There is a light that warms again.\r\n\r\n    \"The house is old, the trees are bare,\r\n      Moonless above bends twilight's dome,\r\n    But what on earth is half so dear--\r\n      So longed for--as the hearth of home?\r\n\r\n    \"The mute bird sitting on the stone,\r\n      The dark moss dripping from the wall,\r\n    The thorn-tree gaunt, the walks o'ergrown,\r\n      I love them; how I love them all!\r\n\r\n    \"And, as I mused, the naked room,\r\n      The alien fire-light died away;\r\n    And from the midst of cheerless gloom\r\n      I passed to bright, unclouded day.\r\n\r\n    \"A little and a lone green lane,\r\n      That opened on a common wide;\r\n    A distant, dreary, dim, blue chain\r\n      Of mountains circling every side:\r\n\r\n    \"A heaven so dear, an earth so calm,\r\n      So sweet, so soft, so hushed an air;\r\n    And--deepening still the dream-like charm--\r\n      Wild moor-sheep feeding everywhere.\r\n\r\n    \"_That_ was the scene, I knew it well;\r\n      I knew the turfy pathway's sweep,\r\n    That, winding o'er each billowy swell,\r\n      Marked out the tracks of wandering sheep.\r\n\r\n    \"Could I have lingered but an hour,\r\n      It well had paid a week of toil;\r\n    But truth has banished fancy's power,\r\n      Restraint and heavy task recoil.\r\n\r\n    \"Even as I stood with raptured eye,\r\n      Absorbed in bliss so deep and dear,\r\n    My hour of rest had fleeted by,\r\n      And back came labour, bondage, care.\"\r\n\r\nCharlotte meanwhile writes in good, even in high spirits to her friend:\r\n\"I think I am never unhappy, my present life is so delightful, so\r\ncongenial, compared to that of a governess. My time, constantly\r\noccupied, passes too rapidly. Hitherto both Emily and I have had good\r\nhealth, and therefore we have been able to work well. There is one\r\nindividual of whom I have not yet spoken--Monsieur Heger, the husband\r\nof Madame. He is professor of rhetoric--a man of power as to mind, but\r\nvery choleric and irritable as to temperament--a little, black, ugly\r\nbeing, with a face that varies in expression; sometimes he borrows the\r\nlineaments of an insane tom cat, sometimes those of a delirious hyena,\r\noccasionally--but very seldom--he discards these perilous attractions\r\nand assumes an air not a hundred times removed from what you would call\r\nmild and gentleman-like. He is very angry with me just at present,\r\nbecause I have written a translation which he chose to stigmatise as\r\n'peu correct.' He did not tell me so, but wrote the words on the margin\r\nof my book, and asked, in brief, stern phrase, how it happened that my\r\ncompositions were always better than my translations? adding that the\r\nthing seemed to him inexplicable.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader will already have recognised in the black, ugly, choleric\r\nlittle professor of rhetoric, the one absolutely natural hero of a\r\nwoman's novel, the beloved and whimsical figure of the immortal Monsieur\r\nPaul Emanuel.\r\n\r\n\"He and Emily,\" adds Charlotte, \"don't draw well together at all. Emily\r\nworks like a horse, and she has had great difficulties to contend with,\r\nfar greater than I have had.\"\r\n\r\nEmily did indeed work hard. She was there to work, and not till she had\r\nlearned a certain amount would her conscience permit her to return to\r\nHaworth. It was for dear liberty that she worked. She began German, a\r\nfavourite study in after years, and of some purpose, since the style of\r\nHofmann left its impression on the author of 'Wuthering Heights.' She\r\nworked hard at music; and in half a year the stumbling schoolgirl became\r\na brilliant and proficient musician. Her playing is said to have been\r\nsingularly accurate, vivid, and full of fire. French, too, both in\r\ngrammar and in literature, was a constant study.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Heger recognised the fact that in dealing with the Brontes he\r\nhad not to make the customary allowances for a schoolgirl's undeveloped\r\ninexperience. These were women of mature and remarkable intelligence.\r\nThe method he adopted in teaching them was rather that of a University\r\nprofessor than such as usually is used in a pensionnat. He would choose\r\nsome masterpiece of French style, some passage of eloquence or\r\nportraiture, read it to them with a brief lecture on its distinctive\r\nqualities, pointing out what was exaggerated, what apt, what false, what\r\nsubtle in the author's conception or his mode of expressing it. They\r\nwere then dismissed to make a similar composition, without the aid of\r\ngrammar or dictionary, availing themselves as far as possible of the\r\n_nuances_ of style and the peculiarities of method of the writer chosen\r\nas the model of the hour. In this way the girls became intimately\r\nacquainted with the literary _technique_ of the best French masters. To\r\nCharlotte the lessons were of incalculable value, perfecting in her that\r\nclear and accurate style which makes her best work never wearisome,\r\nnever old-fashioned. But the very thought of imitating any one,\r\nespecially of imitating any French writer, was repulsive to Emily,\r\n\"rustic all through, moorish, wild and knotty as a root of heath.\"[7]\r\nWhen Monsieur Heger had explained his plan to them, \"Emily spoke first;\r\nand said that she saw no good to be derived from it; and that by\r\nadopting it they would lose all originality of thought and expression.\r\nShe would have entered into an argument on the subject, but for this\r\nMonsieur Heger had no time. Charlotte then spoke; she also doubted the\r\nsuccess of the plan; but she would follow out Monsieur Heger's advice,\r\nbecause she was bound to obey him while she was his pupil.\"[8] Charlotte\r\nsoon found a keen enjoyment in this species of literary composition, yet\r\nEmily's _devoir_ was the best. They are, alas, no longer to be seen, no\r\nlonger in the keeping of so courteous and proud a guardian as Mrs.\r\nGaskell had to deal with; but she and Monsieur Heger both have expressed\r\ntheir opinions that in genius, imagination, power and force of language,\r\nEmily was the superior of the two sisters.\r\n\r\nSo great was the personality of this energetic, silent, brooding,\r\nill-dressed young Englishwoman, that all who knew her recognised in her\r\nthe genius they were slow to perceive in her more sociable and vehement\r\nsister. Madame Heger, the worldly, cold-mannered, _surveillante_ of\r\nVillette, avowed the singular force of a nature most antipathetic to her\r\nown. Yet Emily had no companions; the only person of whom we hear, in\r\neven the most negative terms of friendliness, is one of the teachers, a\r\ncertain Mademoiselle Marie, \"talented and original, but of repulsive and\r\narbitrary manners, which have made the whole school, except Emily and\r\nmyself, her bitter enemies.\" No less arbitrary and repulsive seemed poor\r\nEmily herself, a sprig of purple heath at discord with those bright,\r\nsmooth geraniums and lobelias; Emily, of whom every surviving friend\r\nextols the never-failing, quiet unselfishness, the genial spirit ready\r\nto help, the timid but faithful affection. She was so completely _hors\r\nde son assiette_ that even her virtues were misplaced.\r\n\r\nThere was always one thing she could do, one thing as natural as breath\r\nto Emily--determined labour. In that merciful engrossment she could\r\nforget her heart-sick weariness and the jarring strangeness of things;\r\nevery lesson conquered was another step taken on the long road home. And\r\nthe days allowed ample space for work, although it was supported upon a\r\nsomewhat slender diet.\r\n\r\nCounting boarders and externes, Madame Heger's school numbered over a\r\nhundred pupils. These were divided into three classes; the second, in\r\nwhich the Brontes were, containing sixty students. In the last row, side\r\nby side, absorbed and quiet, sat Emily and Charlotte. Soon after rising,\r\nthe pensionnaires were given their light Belgian breakfast of coffee and\r\nrolls. Then from nine to twelve they studied. Three mistresses and seven\r\nprofessors were engaged to take the different classes. At twelve a lunch\r\nof bread and fruit; then a turn in the green alley, Charlotte and Emily\r\nalways walking together. From one till two fancy-work; from two till\r\nfour, lessons again. Then dinner: the one solid meal of the day. From\r\nfive till six the hour was free, Emily's musing-hour. From six till\r\nseven the terrible _lecture pieuse_, hateful to the Brontes' Protestant\r\nspirit. At eight a supper of rolls and water; then prayers, and to bed.\r\n\r\nThe room they slept in was a long school-dormitory. After all they could\r\nnot get the luxury, so much desired, of a separate room. But their two\r\nbeds were alone together at the further end, veiled in white curtains;\r\ndiscreet and retired as themselves. Here, after the day's hard work,\r\nthey slept. In sleep, one is no longer an exile.\r\n\r\nBut often Emily did not sleep. The old well-known pain, wakefulness,\r\nlonging, was again beginning to relax her very heartstrings. \"The same\r\nsuffering and conflict ensued, heightened by the strong recoil of her\r\nupright heretic and English spirit from the gentle Jesuitry of the\r\nforeign and Romish system. Once more she seemed sinking, but this time\r\nshe rallied through the mere force of resolution: with inward remorse\r\nand shame she looked back on her former failure, and resolved to\r\nconquer, but the victory cost her dear. She was never happy till she\r\ncarried her hard-won knowledge back to the remote English village, the\r\nold parsonage house and desolate Yorkshire hills.\"[9]\r\n\r\nBut not yet, not yet, this happiness! The opportunity that had been so\r\nhardly won must not be thrown away before the utmost had been made of\r\nit. And she was not utterly alone. Charlotte was there. The success that\r\nshe had in her work must have helped a little to make her foreign home\r\ntolerable to her. Soon she knew enough of music to give lessons to the\r\nyounger pupils. Then German, costing her and Charlotte an extra ten\r\nfrancs the month, as also much severe study and struggle. Charlotte\r\nwrites in the summer: \"Emily is making rapid progress in French, German,\r\nmusic and drawing. Monsieur and Madame Heger begin to recognise the\r\nvaluable parts of her character under her singularities.\"\r\n\r\nIt was doubtful, even, whether they would come home in September. Madame\r\nHeger made a proposal to her two English pupils for them to stay on,\r\nwithout paying, but without salary, for half a year. She would dismiss\r\nher English teacher, whose place Charlotte would take. Emily was to\r\nteach music to the younger pupils. The proposal was kind and would be of\r\nadvantage to the sisters.\r\n\r\nCharlotte declared herself inclined to accept it. \"I have been happy in\r\nBrussels,\" she averred. And Emily, though she, indeed, was not happy,\r\nacknowledged the benefit to be derived from a longer term of study. Six\r\nmonths, after all, was rather short to gain a thorough knowledge of\r\nFrench, with Italian and German, when you add to these acquirements\r\nmusic and drawing, which Emily worked at with a will. Besides, she could\r\nnot fail again, could not go back to Haworth leaving Charlotte behind;\r\nneither could she spoil Charlotte's future by persuading her to reject\r\nMadame Heger's terms. So both sisters agreed to stay in Brussels. They\r\nwere not utterly friendless there; two Miss Taylors, schoolfellows and\r\ndear friends of Charlotte's, were at school at the Chateau de Kokleberg,\r\njust outside the barriers. Readers of 'Shirley' know them as Rose and\r\nJessie Yorke. The Brontes met them often, nearly every week, at some\r\ncousins of the Taylors, who lived in the town. But this diversion,\r\npleasant to Charlotte, was merely an added annoyance to Emily. She would\r\nsit stiff and silent, unable to say a word, longing to be somewhere at\r\nher ease. Mrs. Jenkins, too, had begun with asking them to spend their\r\nSundays with her; but Emily never said a word, and Charlotte, though\r\nsometimes she got excited and spoke well and vehemently, never ventured\r\non an opinion till she had gradually wheeled round in her chair with her\r\nback to the person she addressed. They were so shy, so rustic, Mrs.\r\nJenkins gave over inviting them, feeling that they did not like to\r\nrefuse, and found it no pleasure to come. Charlotte, indeed, still had\r\nthe Taylors, their cousins, and the family of a doctor living in the\r\ntown, whose daughter was a pupil and friend of hers. Charlotte, too, had\r\nMadame Heger and her admired professor of rhetoric; but Emily had no\r\nfriend except her sister.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was settled they should stay. The _grandes vacances_\r\nbegan on the 15th of August, and, as the journey to Yorkshire cost so\r\nmuch, and as they were anxious to work, the Bronte girls spent their\r\nholidays in Rue d'Isabelle. Besides themselves only six or eight\r\nboarders remained. All their friends were away holiday-making; but they\r\nworked hard, preparing their lessons for the masters who, holidayless as\r\nthey, had stayed behind in white, dusty, blazing, airless Brussels, to\r\ngive lectures to the scanty class at Madame Heger's pensionnat.\r\n\r\nSo the dreary six weeks passed away. In October the term began again,\r\nthe pupils came back, new pupils were admitted, Monsieur Heger was more\r\ngesticulatory, vehement, commanding than usual, and Madame, in her quiet\r\nway, was no less occupied. Life and youth filled the empty rooms. The\r\nBronte girls, sad enough indeed, for their friend Martha Taylor had died\r\nsuddenly at the Chateau de Kokleberg, were, notwithstanding, able to\r\nfeel themselves in a more natural position for women of their age.\r\nCharlotte, henceforth, by Monsieur Heger's orders, \"Mademoiselle\r\nCharlotte,\" was the new English teacher; Emily the assistant\r\nmusic-mistress. But, in the middle of October, in the first flush of\r\ntheir employment, came a sudden recall to Haworth. Miss Branwell was\r\nvery ill. Immediately the two girls, who owed so much to her, who, but\r\nfor her bounty, could never have been so far away in time of need,\r\ndecided to go home. They broke their determination to Monsieur and\r\nMadame Heger, who, sufficiently generous to place the girls' duty before\r\ntheir own convenience, upheld them in their course. They hastily packed\r\nup their things, took places _via_ Antwerp to London, and prepared to\r\nstart. At the last moment, the trunks packed, in the early morning the\r\npostman came. He brought another letter from Haworth. Their aunt was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nSo much the greater need that they should hasten home. Their father,\r\nleft without his companion of twenty years, to keep his house, to read\r\nto him at night, to discuss with him on equal terms, their father would\r\nbe lonely and distressed. Henceforth one of his daughters must stay with\r\nhim. Anne was in an excellent situation; must they ask her to give it\r\nup? And what now of the school, the school at Burlington? There was much\r\nto take counsel over and consider; they must hurry home. So, knowing the\r\nworst, their future hanging out of shape and loose before their eyes,\r\nthey set out on their dreary journey knowing not whether or when they\r\nmight return.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: C.

Memoir of her sisters.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nA RETROSPECT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Poor, brilliant, gay, moody, moping, wildly excitable, miserable\r\nBronte! No history records your many struggles after the good--your wit,\r\nbrilliance, attractiveness, eagerness for excitement--all the qualities\r\nwhich made you such 'good company' and dragged you down to an untimely\r\ngrave.\"\r\n\r\nThus ejaculates Mr. Francis H. Grundy, remembering the boon-companion of\r\nhis early years, the half-insane, pitiful creature that opium and brandy\r\nhad made of clever Branwell at twenty-two. Returned from Bradford, his\r\nnervous system racked by opium fumes, he had loitered about at Haworth\r\nuntil his father, stubborn as he was, perceived the obvious fact that\r\nevery idle day led his only son more hopelessly down to the pit of ruin.\r\nAt last he exerted his influence to find some work for Branwell, and\r\nobtained for his reckless, fanciful, morbid lad the post of\r\nstation-master at a small roadside place, Luddendenfoot by name, on the\r\nLancashire and Yorkshire Railway. Thither he went some months before\r\nCharlotte and Emily left for Brussels. It was there Mr. Grundy met him;\r\na novel station-master.\r\n\r\n\"Had a position been chosen for this strange creature for the express\r\npurpose of driving him several steps to the bad, this must have been it.\r\nThe line was only just opened. The station was a rude wooden hut, and\r\nthere was no village near at hand. Alone in the wilds of Yorkshire,\r\nwith few books, little to do, no prospects, and wretched pay, with no\r\nsociety congenial to his better taste, but plenty of wild, rollicking,\r\nhard-headed, half-educated manufacturers, who would welcome him to their\r\nhouses, and drink with him as often as he chose to come, what was this\r\nmorbid man, who couldn't bear to be alone, to do?\"[10]\r\n\r\nWhat Branwell always did, in fine, was that which was easiest to him to\r\ndo. He drank himself violent, when he did not drink himself maudlin. He\r\nleft the porter at the station to keep the books, and would go off for\r\ndays \"on the drink\" with his friends and fellow-carousers. About this\r\ntime Mr. Grundy, then an engineer at Halifax, fell in with the poor,\r\nhalf-demented, lonely creature, and for a while things went a little\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nDrink and riot had not embellished the tawny-maned, laughing, handsome\r\ndarling of Haworth. Here is his portrait as at this time he appeared to\r\nhis friend:\r\n\r\n\"He was insignificantly small--one of his life's trials. He had a mass\r\nof red hair, which he wore brushed high off his forehead--to help his\r\nheight, I fancy--a great, bumpy, intellectual forehead, nearly half the\r\nsize of the whole facial contour; small ferrety eyes, deep-sunk and\r\nstill further hidden by the never-removed spectacles; prominent nose,\r\nbut weak lower features. He had a downcast look, which never varied,\r\nsave for a rapid momentary glance at long intervals. Small and thin of\r\nperson, he was the reverse of attractive at first sight.\"\r\n\r\nYet this insignificant, sunken-eyed slip of humanity had a spell for\r\nthose who heard him speak. There was no subject, moral, intellectual, or\r\nphilosophic too remote or too profound for him to measure it at a\r\nmoment's notice, with the ever-ready, fallacious plumb-line of his\r\nbrilliant vanity. He would talk for hours: be eloquent, convincing,\r\nalmost noble; and afterwards accompany his audience to the nearest\r\npublic-house.\r\n\r\n\"At times we would drive over in a gig to Haworth (twelve miles) and\r\nvisit his people. He was there at his best, and would be eloquent and\r\namusing, although sometimes he would burst into tears when returning,\r\nand swear that he meant to amend. I believe, however, that he was half\r\nmad and could not control himself.\"[11]\r\n\r\nSo must his friends in kindness think. Mad; if haunting, morbid dreads\r\nand fancies conjured up by poisonous drugs and never to be laid; if a\r\nwill laid prostrate under the yoke of unclean habits; if a constitution\r\nprone to nervous derangement and blighted by early excess; if such\r\nthings forcing him by imperceptible daily pressure to choose the things\r\nhe loathed, to be the thing he feared, to act a part abhorrent to his\r\nsoul; if such estranging and falsification of a man's true self may\r\ncount as lunacy, the luckless, worthless boy was mad.\r\n\r\nIt must have galled him, going home, to be welcomed so kindly, hoped so\r\nmuch from, by those who had forgiven amply, and did not dream how heavy\r\na mortgage had since been laid upon their pardon; to have talked to the\r\nprim, pretty old lady who denied herself every day to save an\r\ninheritance for him; to watch pious, gentle Anne into whose dreams the\r\nsins she prayed against had never entered; worst of all, the sight of\r\nhis respectable, well-preserved father, honoured by all the parish,\r\nsuccessful, placed by his own stern, continued, will high beyond the\r\nonslaughts of temptation, yet with a temperament singularly akin to that\r\nmorbid, passionate son's.\r\n\r\nSo he would weep going home; weep for his falling off, and perhaps more\r\nsincerely for the short life of his contrition. Then the long evenings\r\nalone with his thoughts in that lonely place would make him afraid of\r\nrepentance, afraid of God, himself, night, all. He would drink.\r\n\r\nHe had fits of as contrary pride. \"He was proud of his name, his\r\nstrength and his abilities.\" Proud of his name! He wrote a poem on it,\r\n\"Bronte,\" an eulogy of Nelson, which won the patronising approbation of\r\nLeigh Hunt, Miss Martineau and others, to whom, at his special request,\r\nit was submitted. Had he ever heard of his dozen aunts and uncles, the\r\nPruntys of Ahaderg? Or if not, with what sensations must the Vicar of\r\nHaworth have listened to this blazoning forth and triumphing over the\r\nglories of his ancient name?\r\n\r\nBranwell had fits of passion, too, the repetition of his father's\r\nvagaries. \"I have seen him drive his doubled fist through the panels of\r\na door--it seemed to soothe him.\" The rough side of his nature got full\r\nplay, and perhaps won him some respect denied to his cleverness, in the\r\nsociety amongst which he was chiefly thrown. For a little time the\r\ncompanionship of Mr. Grundy served to rescue him from utter abandonment\r\nto license. But, in the midst of this improvement, the crash came. As he\r\nhad sown, he reaped.\r\n\r\nThose long absences, drinking at the houses of his friends, had been\r\nturned to account by the one other inhabitant of the station at\r\nLuddendenfoot. The luggage porter was left to keep the books, and,\r\nfollowing his master's example, he sought his own enjoyment before his\r\nemployers' gain. He must have made a pretty penny out of those escapades\r\nof Branwell's, for some months after the Vicar of Haworth had obtained\r\nhis son's appointment, when the books received their customary\r\nexamination, serious defalcations were discovered. An inquiry was\r\ninstituted, which brought to light Branwell's peculiar method of\r\nmanaging the station. The lad himself was not suspected of actual theft;\r\nbut so continued, so glaring had been his negligence, so hopeless the\r\ncause, that he was summarily dismissed the company's service, and sent\r\nhome in dire disgrace to Haworth.\r\n\r\nHe came home not only in disgrace, but ill. Never strong, his\r\nconstitution was deranged and broken by his excesses; yet, strangely\r\nenough, consumption, which carried off so prematurely the more\r\nhighly-gifted, the more strongly-principled daughters of the house,\r\nconsumption, which might have been originally produced by the vicious\r\nlife this youth had led, laid no claim upon him. His mother's character\r\nand her disease descended to her daughters only. Branwell inherited his\r\nfather's violent temper, strong passions and nervous weakness without\r\nthe strength of will and moral fibre that made his father remarkable.\r\nProbably this brilliant, weak, shallow, selfish lad reproduced\r\naccurately enough the characteristics of some former Prunty; for Patrick\r\nBranwell was as distinctly an Irishman as if his childhood had been\r\nspent in his grandfather's cabin at Ahaderg.\r\n\r\nHe came home to find his sisters all away. Anne in her situation as\r\ngoverness. Emily and Charlotte in Rue d'Isabelle. No one, therefore, to\r\nbe a check upon his habits, save the neat old lady, growing weaker day\r\nby day, who spent nearly all her time in her bedroom to avoid the paven\r\nfloors of the basement; and the father, who did not care for company,\r\ntook his meals alone for fear of indigestion, and found it necessary to\r\nspend the succeeding time in perfect quiet. The greater part of the day\r\nwas, therefore, at Branwell's uncontrolled, unsupervised disposal.\r\n\r\nTo do him justice, he does seem to have made so much effort after a new\r\nplace of work as was involved in writing letters to his friend Grundy,\r\nand probably to others, suing for employment. But his offence had been\r\ntoo glaring to be condoned. Mr. Grundy seems to have advised the hapless\r\nyoung man to take shelter in the Church, where the influence of his\r\nfather and his mother's relatives might help him along; but, as Branwell\r\nsaid, he had not a single qualification, \"save, perhaps hypocrisy.\"\r\nParson's sons rarely have a great idea of the Church. The energy,\r\nself-denial, and endurance which a clergyman ought to possess were\r\ncertainly not in Branwell's line. Besides, how could he take his degree?\r\nMontgomery, it seems, recommended him to make trial of literature. \"All\r\nvery well, but I have little conceit of myself and great desire for\r\nactivity. You say that you write with feelings similar to those with\r\nwhich you last left me; keep them no longer. I trust I am somewhat\r\nchanged, or I should not be worth a thought; and though nothing could\r\never give me your buoyant spirits and an outward man corresponding\r\ntherewith, I may, in dress and appearance, emulate something like\r\nordinary decency. And now, wherever coming years may lead--Greenland's\r\nsnows or sands of Afric--I trust, etc. 9th June, 1842.\"[12]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful, judging from Branwell's letters and his verses, whether\r\nanything much better than his father's 'Cottage in the Wood' would have\r\nresulted from his following the advice of James Montgomery. Fluent ease,\r\noften on the verge of twaddle, with here and there a bright, felicitous\r\ntouch, with here and there a smack of the conventional hymn-book and\r\npulpit twang--such weak and characterless effusions are all that is left\r\nof the passion-ridden pseudo-genius of Haworth. Real genius is perhaps\r\nseldom of such showy temperament.\r\n\r\nPoor Branwell! it needed greater strength than his to retrieve that\r\nfirst false step into ruin. He cannot help himself, and can find no one\r\nto help him; he appeals again to Mr. Grundy (in a letter which must,\r\nfrom internal evidence, have been written about this time, although a\r\ndifferent and impossible year is printed at its heading):--\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot avoid the temptation to cheer my spirits by\r\n     scribbling a few lines to you while I sit here alone, all\r\n     the household being at church--the sole occupant of an\r\n     ancient parsonage among lonely hills, which probably will\r\n     never hear the whistle of an engine till I am in my grave.\r\n\r\n     \"After experiencing, since my return home, extreme pain and\r\n     illness, with mental depression worse than either, I have at\r\n     length acquired health and strength and soundness of mind,\r\n     far superior, I trust, to anything shown by that miserable\r\n     wreck you used to know under my name. I can now speak\r\n     cheerfully and enjoy the company of another without the\r\n     stimulus of six glasses of whisky. I can write, think and\r\n     act with some apparent approach to resolution, and I only\r\n     want a motive for exertion to be happier than I have been\r\n     for years. But I feel my recovery from _almost insanity_ to\r\n     be retarded by having nothing to listen to except the wind\r\n     moaning among old chimneys and older ash-trees--nothing to\r\n     look at except heathery hills, walked over when life had all\r\n     to hope for and nothing to regret with me--no one to speak\r\n     to except crabbed old Greeks and Romans who have been dust\r\n     the last five [_sic_] thousand years. And yet this quiet\r\n     life, from its contrast, makes the year passed at\r\n     Luddendenfoot appear like a nightmare, for I would rather\r\n     give my hand than undergo again the grovelling carelessness,\r\n     the malignant, yet cold debauchery, the determination to\r\n     find out how far mind could carry body without both being\r\n     chucked into hell, which too often marked my conduct when\r\n     there, lost as I was to all I really liked, and seeking\r\n     relief in the indulgence of feelings which form the blackest\r\n     spot in my character.\r\n\r\n     \"Yet I have something still left me which may do me service.\r\n     But I ought not to remain too long in solitude, for the\r\n     world soon forgets those who have bidden it 'good-bye.'\r\n     Quiet is an excellent cure, but no medicine should be\r\n     continued after a patient's recovery, so I am about, though\r\n     ashamed of the business, to dun you for answers to ----.\r\n\r\n     \"Excuse the trouble I am giving to one on whose kindness I\r\n     have no claim, and for whose services I am offering no\r\n     return except gratitude and thankfulness, which are already\r\n     due to you. Give my sincere regards to Mr. Stephenson. A\r\n     word or two to show you have not altogether forgotten me\r\n     will greatly please,\r\n\r\n       \"Yours, etc.\"\r\n\r\nAlas, no helping hand rescued the sinking wretch from the quicksands of\r\nidle sensuality which slowly engulfed him! Yet, at this time, there\r\nmight have been hope, had he been kept from evil. Deliver himself he\r\ncould not. His \"great desire for activity\" seems to have had to be in\r\nabeyance for some months, for on the 25th of October he is still at\r\nHaworth. He then writes to Mr. Grundy again. The letter brings us up to\r\nthe time when--in the cheerless morning--Charlotte and Emily set out on\r\ntheir journey homewards; it reveals to us how much real undeserved\r\nsuffering must have been going on side by side with Branwell's\r\npurposeless miseries in the grey old parsonage at Haworth. The good\r\nmethodical old maiden aunt--who for twenty years had given the best of\r\nher heart to this gay affectionate nephew of hers--had come down to the\r\nedge of the grave, having waited long enough to see the hopeless fallacy\r\nof all her dreams for him, all her affection. Branwell, who was really\r\ntender-hearted, must have been sobered then.\r\n\r\nHe writes to Mr. Grundy in a sincere and manly strain:--\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"There is no misunderstanding. I have had a long attendance\r\n     at the death-bed of the Rev. Mr. Weightman, one of my\r\n     dearest friends, and now I am attending at the death-bed of\r\n     my Aunt, who has been for twenty years as my mother. I\r\n     expect her to die in a few hours.\r\n\r\n     \"As my sisters are far from home, I have had much on my\r\n     mind, and these things must serve as an apology for what was\r\n     never intended as neglect of your friendship to us.\r\n\r\n     \"I had meant not only to have written to you, but to the\r\n     Rev. James Martineau, gratefully and sincerely acknowledging\r\n     the receipt of his most kindly and truthful criticism--at\r\n     least in advice, though too generous far in praise--but one\r\n     sad ceremony must, I fear, be gone through first. Give my\r\n     most sincere respects to Mr. Stephenson, and excuse this\r\n     scrawl; my eyes are too dim with sorrow to see well.\r\n     Believe me, your not very happy, but obliged friend and\r\n     servant,\r\n\r\n       \"P. B. BRONTE.\"\r\n\r\nBut not till three days later the end came. By that time Anne was home\r\nto tend the woman who had taken her, a little child, into her love and\r\nalways kept her there. Anne had ever lived gladly with Miss Branwell;\r\nher more dejected spirit did not resent the occasional oppressions, the\r\nlittle tyrannies, which revolted Charlotte and silenced Emily. And, at\r\nthe last, all the constant self-sacrifice of those twenty years, spent\r\nfor their sake in a strange and hated country, would shine out, and yet\r\nmore endear the sufferer to those who had to lose her.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of October Branwell again writes to his friend:--\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n     \"As I don't want to lose a _real_ friend, I write in\r\n     deprecation of the tone of your letter. Death only has made\r\n     me neglectful of your kindness, and I have lately had so\r\n     much experience with him, that your sister would _not now_\r\n     blame me for indulging in gloomy visions either of this\r\n     world or of another. I am incoherent, I fear, but I have\r\n     been waking two nights witnessing such agonising suffering\r\n     as I would not wish my worst enemy to endure; and I have now\r\n     lost the pride and director of all the happy days connected\r\n     with my childhood. I have suffered such sorrow since I last\r\n     saw you at Haworth, that I do not now care if I were\r\n     fighting in India, or ---- since, when the mind is\r\n     depressed, danger is the most effectual cure.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Branwell was dead. All was over: she was buried on a Tuesday\r\nmorning, before Charlotte and Emily, having travelled night and day,\r\ngot home. They found Mr. Bronte and Anne sitting together, quietly\r\nmourning the customary presence to be known no more. Branwell was not\r\nthere. It was the first time he would see his sisters since his great\r\ndisgrace; he could not wait at home to welcome them.\r\n\r\nMiss Branwell's will had to be made known. The little property that she\r\nhad saved out of her frugal income was all left to her three nieces.\r\nBranwell had been her darling, the only son, called by her name; but his\r\ndisgrace had wounded her too deeply. He was not even mentioned in her\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: 'Pictures of the Past.' F. H. Grundy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: 'Pictures of the Past.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: 'Pictures of the Past.']\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE RECALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly recalled from what had seemed the line of duty, with all their\r\nfuture prospects broken, the three sisters found themselves again at\r\nHaworth together. There could be no question now of their keeping a\r\nschool at Burlington; if at all, it must be at Haworth, where their\r\nfather could live with them. Miss Branwell's legacies would amply\r\nprovide for the necessary alterations in the house; the question before\r\nthem was whether they should immediately begin these alterations, or\r\nfirst of all secure a higher education to themselves.\r\n\r\nAt all events one must stay at home to keep house for Mr. Bronte. Emily\r\nquickly volunteered to be the one. Her offer was welcome to all; she was\r\nthe most experienced housekeeper. Anne had a comfortable situation,\r\nwhich she might resume at the end of the Christmas holidays, and\r\nCharlotte was anxious to get back to Brussels.\r\n\r\nIt would certainly be of advantage to their school, that cherished dream\r\nnow so likely to come true, that the girls should be able to teach\r\nGerman, and that one of them at least should speak French with fluency\r\nand well. Monsieur Heger wrote to Mr. Bronte when Charlotte and Emily\r\nleft, pointing out how much more stable and enduring their advantages\r\nwould become, could they continue for another year at Brussels. \"In a\r\nyear,\" he says, \"each of your daughters would be completely provided\r\nagainst the future; each of them was acquiring at the same time\r\ninstruction and the science to instruct. Mademoiselle Emily has been\r\nlearning the piano, receiving lessons from the best master that we have\r\nin Brussels, and already she had little pupils of her own; she was\r\ntherefore losing at the same time a remainder of ignorance, and one,\r\nmore embarrassing still, of timidity. Mademoiselle Charlotte was\r\nbeginning to give lessons in French, and was acquiring that assurance\r\nand _aplomb_ so necessary to a teacher. One year more, at the most, and\r\nthe work had been completed, and completed well.\"\r\n\r\nEmily, as we know, refused the lure. Once at Haworth, she was not to be\r\ninduced, by offer of any advantages, to quit her native heath. On the\r\nother hand, Charlotte desired nothing better. Hers was a nature very\r\ncapable of affection, of gratitude, of sentiment. It would have been a\r\nsore wrench to her to break so suddenly with her busy, quiet life in the\r\nold mansion, Rue d'Isabelle. Almost imperceptibly she had become fast\r\nfriends with the place. Mary Taylor had left, it is true, and bright,\r\nengaging Martha slept there, too sound to hear her, in the Protestant\r\ncemetery. But in foreign, heretic, distant Brussels there were calling\r\nmemories for the downright, plain little Yorkshire woman. She could not\r\nchoose but hear. The blackavised, tender-hearted, fiery professor, for\r\nwhom she felt the reverent, eager friendship that intellectual girls\r\noften give to a man much older than they; the doctor's family; even\r\nMadame Beck; even the Belgian schoolgirls--she should like to see them\r\nall again. She did not perhaps realise how different a place Brussels\r\nwould seem without her sister. And it would certainly be an advantage\r\nfor the school that she should know German. For these, and many\r\nreasons, Charlotte decided to renounce a salary of L50 a year offered\r\nher in England, and to accept that of L16 which she would earn in\r\nBrussels.\r\n\r\nThus it was determined that at the end of the Christmas holidays the\r\nthree sisters were again to be divided. But first they were nearly three\r\nmonths together.\r\n\r\nBranwell was at home. Even yet at Haworth that was a pleasure and not a\r\nburden. His sisters never saw him at his worst; his vehement repentance\r\nbrought conviction to their hearts. They still hoped for his future,\r\nstill said to each other that men were different from women, and that\r\nsuch strong passions betokened a nature which, if once directed right,\r\nwould be passionately right. They did not feel the miserable flabbiness\r\nof his moral fibre; did not know that the weak slip down when they try\r\nto stand, and cannot march erect. They were both too tender and too\r\nharsh with their brother, because they could not recognise what a mere,\r\npoor creature was this erring genius of theirs.\r\n\r\nThus, when the first shock was over, the reunited family was most\r\ncontented. Lightly, naturally, as an autumn leaf, the old aunt had\r\nfallen out of the household, her long duties over; and they--though they\r\nloved and mourned her--they were freer for her departure. There was no\r\nrestraint now on their actions, their opinions; they were mistresses in\r\ntheir own home. It was a happy Christmas, though not free from burden.\r\nThe sisters, parted for so long, had much experience to exchange, many\r\nplans to make. They had to revisit their old haunts on the moors, white\r\nnow with snow. There were walks to the library at Keighley for such\r\nbooks as had been added during their absence. Ellen came to Haworth.\r\nThen, at the end of January 1843, Anne went back to her duties, and\r\nCharlotte set off alone for Brussels.\r\n\r\nEmily was left behind with Branwell; but not for long. It must have been\r\nabout this time that the ill-fated young man obtained a place as tutor\r\nin the house where Anne was governess. It appeared a most fortunate\r\nconnection; the family was well known for its respectable position, came\r\nof a stock eminent in good works, and the sisters might well believe\r\nthat, under Anne's gentle influence and such favouring auspices, their\r\nbrother would be led into the way of the just.\r\n\r\nThen Emily was alone in the grey house, save for her secluded father and\r\nold Tabby, now over seventy. She was not unhappy. No life could be freer\r\nthan her own; it was she that disposed, she too that performed most of\r\nthe household work. She always got up first in the morning and did the\r\nroughest part of the day's labour before frail old Tabby came down;\r\nsince kindness and thought for others were part of the nature of this\r\nunsocial, rugged woman. She did the household ironing and most of the\r\ncookery. She made the bread; and her bread was famous in Haworth for its\r\nlightness and excellence. As she kneaded the dough, she would glance now\r\nand then at an open book propped up before her. It was her German\r\nlesson. But not always did she study out of books; those who worked with\r\nher in that kitchen, young girls called in to help in stress of\r\nbusiness, remember how she would keep a scrap of paper, a pencil, at her\r\nside, and how, when the moment came that she could pause in her cooking\r\nor her ironing, she would jot down some impatient thought and then\r\nresume her work. With these girls she was always friendly and\r\nhearty--\"pleasant, sometimes quite jovial like a boy,\" \"so genial and\r\nkind, a little masculine,\" say my informants; but of strangers she was\r\nexceedingly timid, and if the butcher's boy or the baker's man came to\r\nthe kitchen door she would be off like a bird into the hall or the\r\nparlour till she heard their hob-nails clumping down the path. No easy\r\ngetting sight of that rare bird. Therefore, it may be, the Haworth\r\npeople thought more of her powers than of those of Anne or Charlotte,\r\nwho might be seen at school any Sunday. They say: \"A deal o' folk thout\r\nher th' clever'st o' them a', hasumiver shoo wur so timid, shoo cudn't\r\nframe to let it aat.\"\r\n\r\nFor amusements she had her pets and the garden. She always fed the\r\nanimals herself: the old cat; Flossy, Anne's favourite spaniel; Keeper,\r\nthe fierce bulldog, her own constant, dear companion, whose portrait,\r\ndrawn by her spirited hand, is still extant. And the creatures on the\r\nmoor were all, in a sense, her pets and familiar with her. The intense\r\ndevotion of this silent woman to all manner of dumb creatures has\r\nsomething pathetic, inexplicable, almost deranged. \"She never showed\r\nregard to any human creature; all her love was reserved for animals,\"\r\nsaid some shallow jumper at conclusions to Mrs. Gaskell. Regard and help\r\nand staunch friendliness to all in need was ever characteristic of Emily\r\nBronte; yet between her nature and that of the fierce, loving, faithful\r\nKeeper, that of the wild moor-fowl, of robins that die in confinement,\r\nof quick-running hares, of cloud-sweeping, tempest-boding sea-mews,\r\nthere was a natural likeness.\r\n\r\nThe silent-growing flowers were also her friends. The little garden,\r\nopen to all the winds that course over Lees Moor and Stillingworth Moor\r\nto the blowy summit of Haworth Street--that little garden whose only\r\nbulwark against the storm was the gravestones outside the railing, the\r\nstunted thorns and currant-bushes within--was nevertheless the home of\r\nmany sweet and hardy flowers, creeping up under the house and close to\r\nthe shelter of the bushes. So the days went swiftly enough in tending\r\nher house, her garden, her dumb creatures. In the evenings she would sit\r\non the hearthrug in the lonely parlour, one arm thrown round Keeper's\r\ntawny neck, studying a book. For it was necessary to study. After the\r\nnext Christmas holidays the sisters hoped to reduce to practice their\r\nlong-cherished vision of keeping school together. Letters from Brussels\r\nshowed Emily that Charlotte was troubled, excited, full of vague\r\ndisquiet. She would be glad, then, to be home, to use the instrument it\r\nhad cost so much pains to perfect. A costly instrument, indeed, wrought\r\nwith love, anguish, lonely fears, vanquished passion; but in that time\r\nno one guessed that, not the school-teacher's German, not the fluent\r\nFrench acquired abroad, was the real result of this terrible firing, but\r\na novel to be called 'Villette.'\r\n\r\nEmily then, \"Mine bonnie love,\" as Charlotte used to call her, cannot\r\nhave been quite certain of this dear sister's happiness; and as time\r\nwent on Anne's letters, too, began to give disquieting tidings. Not that\r\nher health was breaking down; it was, as usual, Branwell whose conduct\r\ndistressed his sisters. He had altered so strangely; one day in the\r\nwildest spirits, the next moping in despair, giving himself mysterious\r\nairs of importance, expressing himself more than satisfied with his\r\nsituation, smiling oddly, then, perhaps, the next moment all remorse and\r\ngloom. Anne could not understand what ailed him, but feared some evil.\r\n\r\nAt home, moreover, troubles slowly increased. Old Tabby grew very ill\r\nand could do no work; the girl Hannah left; Emily had all the business\r\nof investing the little property belonging to the three sisters since\r\nMiss Branwell's death; worse still, old Mr. Bronte's health began to\r\nflag, his sight to fail. Worst of all--in that darkness, despair,\r\nloneliness--the old man, so Emily feared, acquired the habit of\r\ndrinking, though not to excess, yet more than his abstemious past\r\nallowed. Doubtless she exaggerated her fears, with Branwell always\r\npresent in her thoughts. But Emily grew afraid, alone at Haworth,\r\nresponsible, knowing herself deficient in that controlling influence so\r\ncharacteristic of her elder sister. Her burden of doubt was more than\r\nshe could bear. She decided to write to Charlotte.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of January, 1844, Charlotte arrived at Haworth.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of the month she wrote to her friend:--\r\n\r\n     \"Everyone asks me what I am going to do now that I am\r\n     returned home, and everyone seems to expect that I should\r\n     immediately commence a school. In truth it is what I should\r\n     wish to do. I desire it above all things, I have sufficient\r\n     money for the undertaking, and I hope now sufficient\r\n     qualifications to give me a fair chance of success; yet I\r\n     cannot yet permit myself to enter upon life--to touch the\r\n     object which seems now within my reach, and which I have been\r\n     so long straining to attain. You will ask me why? It is on\r\n     papa's account; he is now, as you know, getting old; and it\r\n     grieves me to tell you that he is losing his sight. I have\r\n     felt for some months that I ought not to be away from him,\r\n     and I feel now that it would be too selfish to leave him (at\r\n     least as long as Branwell and Anne are absent) in order to\r\n     pursue selfish interests of my own. With the help of God, I\r\n     will try to deny myself in this matter, and to wait.\r\n\r\n     \"I suffered much before I left Brussels. I think, however\r\n     long I live, I shall not forget what the parting with\r\n     Monsieur Heger cost me. It grieved me so much to grieve him\r\n     who has been so true, kind, disinterested a friend....\r\n     Haworth seems such a lonely quiet spot, buried away from the\r\n     world. I no longer regard myself as young, indeed, I shall\r\n     soon be twenty-eight; and it seems as if I ought to be\r\n     working, and braving the rough realities of the world, as\r\n     other people do----.\"[13]\r\n\r\nWait, eager Charlotte, there are in store for you enough and to spare of\r\nrude realities, enough of working and braving, in this secluded Haworth.\r\nNo need to go forth in quest of dangers and trials. The air is growing\r\nthick with gloom round your mountain eyrie. High as it is, quiet,\r\nlonely, the storms of heaven and the storms of earth have found it out,\r\nto break there.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Mrs. Gaskell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE PROSPECTUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGradually Charlotte's first depression wore away. Long discussions with\r\nEmily, as they took their walks over the moors, long silent brooding of\r\nways and means, as they sat together in the parlour making shirts for\r\nBranwell, long thinking, brought new counsel. She went, moreover, to\r\nstay with her friend Ellen, and the change helped to restore her\r\nweakened health. She writes to her friend:--\r\n\r\n                               \"March 25\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR NELL,\r\n\r\n     \"I got home safely and was not too much tired on arriving at\r\n     Haworth. I feel rather better to-day than I have been, and\r\n     in time I hope to regain more strength. I found Emily and\r\n     papa well, and a letter from Branwell intimating that he and\r\n     Anne are pretty well too. Emily is much obliged to you for\r\n     the seeds you sent. She wishes to know if the Sicilian pea\r\n     and the crimson cornflower are hardy flowers, or if they are\r\n     delicate and should be sown in warm and sheltered\r\n     situations. Write to me to-morrow and let me know how you\r\n     all are, if your mother continues to get better....\r\n\r\n     \"Good morning, dear Nell, I shall say no more to you at\r\n     present.\r\n\r\n       \"C. BRONTE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                               \"Monday morning.\r\n\r\n     \"Our poor little cat has been ill two days and is just dead.\r\n     It is piteous to see even an animal lying lifeless. Emily\r\n     _is_ sorry.\"\r\n\r\nSide by side with all these lighter cares went on the schemes for the\r\nschool. At last the two sisters determined to begin as soon as they saw\r\na fair chance of getting pupils. They began the search in good earnest;\r\nbut fortunately, postponed the necessary alterations in the house until\r\nthey had the secure promise of, at any rate, three or four. Then their\r\ndemands lessened as day by day that chance became more difficult and\r\nfainter. In early summer Charlotte writes: \"As soon as I can get a\r\nchance of only _one_ pupil, I will have cards of terms printed and will\r\ncommence the repairs necessary in the house. I wish all to be done\r\nbefore the winter. I think of fixing the board and English education at\r\nL25 per annum.\"\r\n\r\nStill no pupil was heard of, but the girls went courageously on, writing\r\nto every mother of daughters with whom they could claim acquaintance.\r\nBut, alas, it was the case with one, that her children were already at\r\nschool in Liverpool, with another that her child had just been promised\r\nto Miss C., with a third that she thought the undertaking praiseworthy,\r\nbut Haworth was so very remote a spot. In vain did the girls explain\r\nthat from some points of view the retired situation was an advantage;\r\nsince, had they set up school in some fashionable place, they would have\r\nhad house-rent to pay, and could not possibly have offered an excellent\r\neducation for L25 a year. Parents are an expectant people. Still, every\r\nlady promised to recommend the school to mothers less squeamish, or less\r\nengaged; and, knowing how well they would show themselves worthy of the\r\nchance, once they had obtained it, Charlotte and Emily took heart to\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nThe holidays arrived and still nothing was settled. Anne came home and\r\nhelped in the laying of schemes and writing of letters--but, alas,\r\nBranwell also came home, irritable, extravagant, wildly gay, or gloomily\r\nmoping. His sisters could no longer blind themselves to the fact that he\r\ndrank, drank habitually, to excess. And Anne had fears--vague, terrible,\r\nforeboding--which she could not altogether make plain.\r\n\r\nBy this time they had raised the charge to L35, considering, perhaps,\r\nthat their first offer had been so low as to discredit their attempt.\r\nBut still they got no favourable answers. It was hard, for the girls had\r\nnot been chary of time, money, or trouble to fit themselves for their\r\noccupation. Looking round they could count up many schoolmistresses far\r\nless thoroughly equipped. Only the Brontes had no interest.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Branwell amused himself as best he could. There was always the\r\n\"Black Bull,\" with its admiring circle of drink-fellows, and the girls\r\nwho admired Patrick's courteous bow and Patrick's winning smile. Good\r\npeople all, who little dreamed how much vice, how much misery they were\r\nencouraging by their approbation. Mr. Grundy, too, came over now and\r\nthen to see his old friend. \"I knew them all,\" he says--\"The father,\r\nupright, handsome, distantly courteous, white-haired, tall; knowing me\r\nas his son's friend, he would treat me in the Grandisonian fashion,\r\ncoming himself down to the little inn to invite me, a boy, up to his\r\nhouse, where I would be coldly uncomfortable until I could escape with\r\nPatrick Branwell to the moors. The daughters--distant and distrait,\r\nlarge of nose, small of figure, red of hair (!), prominent of\r\nspectacles; showing great intellectual development, but with eyes\r\nconstantly cast down, very silent, painfully retiring. This was about\r\nthe time of their first literary adventures, say 1843 or 1844.\"[14]\r\n\r\nBut of literary adventure there was at present little thought. The\r\nschool still occupied their thoughts and dreams. At last, no pupil\r\ncoming forward, some cards of terms were printed and given for\r\ndistribution to the friends of Charlotte and Anne; Emily had no friends.\r\n\r\nThere are none left of them, those pitiful cards of terms never granted;\r\nrecords of such unfruitful hopes. They have fitly vanished, like the\r\nghosts of children never born; and quicker still to vanish was the dream\r\nthat called them forth. The weeks went on, and every week of seven\r\nletterless mornings, every week of seven anxious nights, made the\r\nsisters more fully aware that notice and employment would not come to\r\nthem in the way they had dreamed; made them think it well that\r\nBranwell's home should not be the dwelling of innocent children.\r\n\r\nAnne went back to her work leaving the future as uncertain as before.\r\n\r\nIn October Charlotte, always the spokeswoman, writes again to her friend\r\nand diligent helper in this matter:--\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR NELL,\r\n\r\n     \"I, Emily, and Anne are truly obliged to you for the efforts\r\n     you have made in our behalf; and if you have not been\r\n     successful you are only like ourselves. Everyone wishes us\r\n     well; but there are no pupils to be had. We have no present\r\n     intention, however, of breaking our hearts on the subject;\r\n     still less of feeling mortified at our defeat. The effort\r\n     must be beneficial, whatever the result may be, because it\r\n     teaches us experience and an additional knowledge of this\r\n     world.\r\n\r\n     \"I send you two additional circulars, and will send you two\r\n     more, if you desire it, when I write again.\"\r\n\r\nThose four circulars also came to nothing; it was now more than six\r\nmonths since the three sisters had begun their earnest search for\r\npupils: more than three years since they had taken for the ruling aim of\r\ntheir endeavours the formation of this little school. Not one pupil\r\ncould they secure; not one promise. At last they knew that they were\r\nbeaten.\r\n\r\nIn November Charlotte writes again to Ellen:--\r\n\r\n     \"We have made no alterations yet in our house. It would be\r\n     folly to do so while there is so little likelihood of our\r\n     ever getting pupils. I fear you are giving yourself too much\r\n     trouble on our account.\r\n\r\n     \"Depend on it, if you were to persuade a mama to bring her\r\n     child to Haworth, the aspect of the place would frighten\r\n     her, and she would probably take the dear girl back with her\r\n     instanter. We are glad that we have made the attempt, and we\r\n     will not be cast down because it has not succeeded.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThere was no more to be said, only to put carefully by, as one puts by\r\nthe thoughts of an interrupted marriage, all the dreams that had filled\r\nso many months only to lay aside in a drawer, as one lays aside the long\r\nsewn at garments of a still-born child, the plans drawn out for the\r\nbuilder, the printed cards, the lists of books to get; only to face\r\nagain a future of separate toil among strangers, to renounce the vision\r\nof a home together.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: 'Pictures of the Past.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Mrs. Gaskell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nBRANWELL'S FALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the spring grew upon the moors, dappling them with fresh verdant\r\nshoots, clearing the sky overhead, loosening the winds to rush across\r\nthem; as the beautiful season grew ripe in Haworth, every one of its\r\ndays made clearer to the two anxious women waiting there in what shape\r\ntheir blurred foreboding would come true at last. They seldom spoke of\r\nBranwell now.\r\n\r\nIt was a hard and anxious time, ever expectant of an evil just at hand.\r\nMinor troubles, too, gathered round this shapeless boded grief: Mr.\r\nBronte was growing blind; Charlotte, ever nervous, feared the same fate,\r\nand could do but little sewing with her weak, cherished eyesight. Anne's\r\nletters told of health worn out by constant, agonising suspicion. It was\r\nEmily, that strong bearer of burdens, on whom the largest share of work\r\nwas laid.\r\n\r\nCharlotte grew really weak as the summer came. Her sensitive, vehement\r\nnature felt anxiety as a physical pain. She was constantly with her\r\nfather; her spirit sank with his, as month by month his sight grew\r\nsensibly weaker. The old man, to whom his own importance was so dear,\r\nsuffered keenly, indeed, from the fear of actual blindness, and more\r\nfrom the horror of dependence, than from the dread of pain or privation.\r\n\"He fears he will be nothing in the parish,\" says sorrowful Charlotte.\r\nAnd as her father, never impatient, never peevish, became more deeply\r\ncast down and anxious, she, too, became nervous and fearful; she, too,\r\ndejected.\r\n\r\nAt last, when June came and brought no brightness to that grey old\r\nhouse, with the invisible shadow ever hovering above it, Charlotte was\r\npersuaded to seek rest and change in the home of her friend near Leeds.\r\n\r\nAnne was home now; she had come back ill, miserable. She had suspicions\r\nthat made her feel herself degraded, pure soul, concerning her brother's\r\nrelation with her employer's wife. Many letters had passed between them,\r\nthrough her hands too. Too often had she heard her unthinking little\r\npupils threaten their mother into more than customary indulgence,\r\nsaying: \"Unless you do as we wish, we shall tell papa about Mr. Bronte.\"\r\nThe poor girl felt herself an involuntary accomplice to that treachery,\r\nthat deceit.\r\n\r\nTo lie down at night under the roof, to break by day the bread of the\r\ngood, sick, bedridden man, whose honour, she could not but fear, was in\r\njeopardy from her own brother, such dire strain was too great for that\r\nfrail, dejected nature. And yet to say openly to herself that Branwell\r\nhad committed this disgrace--it was impossible. Rather must her\r\nsuspicions be the morbid promptings of a diseased mind. She was wicked\r\nto have felt them. Poor, gentle Anne, sweet, \"prim, little body,\" such\r\nscenes, such unhallowed vicinities of lust, were not for you. At last\r\nsickness came and set her free. She went home.\r\n\r\nHome, with its constant labour, pure air of good works; home, with its\r\nsickness and love, its dread for others and noble sacrifice of self; how\r\nwelcome was it to her wounded spirit! And yet this infinitely lighter\r\ntorment was wearing Charlotte out. They persuaded her to go away, and,\r\nwhen she had yielded, strove to keep her away.\r\n\r\nEmily writes to Ellen in July:--\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR MISS NUSSEY--If you have set your heart on Charlotte\r\n     staying another week, she has our united consent. I, for\r\n     one, will take everything easy on Sunday. I am glad she is\r\n     enjoying herself; let her make the most of the next seven\r\n     days to return stout and hearty. Love to her and you from\r\n     Anne and myself, and tell her all are well at home.--Yours,\r\n\r\n        \"EMILY BRONTE.\"\r\n\r\nCharlotte stayed the extra week, benefiting largely thereby. She started\r\nfor home, and enjoyed her journey, for she travelled with a French\r\ngentleman, and talked again with delight the sweet language which had\r\nleft such lingering echoes in her memory, which forbade her to feel\r\nquite contented any more in her secluded Yorkshire home. Slight as it\r\nwas, the little excitement did her good; feeling brave and ready to face\r\nand fight with a legion of shadows, she reached the gate of her own\r\nhome, went in. Branwell was there.\r\n\r\nHe had been sent home a day or two before, apparently for a holiday. He\r\nmust have known that some discovery had been made at last; he must have\r\nfelt he never would return. Anne, too, must have had some misgivings;\r\nyet the worst was not known yet. Emily, at least, could not guess it.\r\nNot for long this truce with open disgrace. The very day of Charlotte's\r\nreturn a letter had come for Branwell from his employer. All had been\r\nfound out. This letter commanded Branwell never to see again the mother\r\nof the children under his care, never set foot in her home, never write\r\nor speak to her. Branwell, who loved her passionately, had in that\r\nmoment no thought for the shame, the black disgrace, he had brought on\r\nhis father's house. He stormed, raved, swore he could not live without\r\nher; cried out against her next for staying with her husband. Then\r\nprayed the sick man might die soon; they would yet be happy. Ah, he\r\nwould never see her again!\r\n\r\nA strange scene in the quiet parlour of a country vicarage, this anguish\r\nof guilty love, these revulsions from shameful ecstasy to shameful\r\ndespair. Branwell raved on, delirious, agonised; and the blind father\r\nlistened, sick at heart, maybe self-reproachful; and the gentle sister\r\nlistened, shuddering, as if she saw hell lying open at her feet. Emily\r\nlistened, too, indignant at the treachery, horrified at the shame; yet\r\nwith an immense pity in her fierce and loving breast.\r\n\r\nTo this scene Charlotte entered.\r\n\r\nCharlotte, with her vehement sense of right; Charlotte, with her sturdy\r\nindignation; when she, at last understood the whole guilty corrupted\r\npassion that had wrecked two homes, she turned away with something in\r\nher heart suddenly stiffened, dead. It was her passionate love for this\r\nshameful, erring brother, once as dear to her as her own soul. Yet she\r\nwas very patient. She writes to a friend quietly and without too much\r\ndisdain:--\r\n\r\n     \"We have had sad work with Branwell. He thought of nothing\r\n     but stunning or drowning his agony of mind\" (in what\r\n     fashion, the reader knows ere now) \"no one in this house\r\n     could have rest, and at last we have been obliged to send\r\n     him from home for a week, with some one to look after him.\r\n     He has written to me this morning, expressing some sense of\r\n     contrition ... but as long as he remains at home, I scarce\r\n     dare hope for peace in the house. We must all, I fear,\r\n     prepare for a season of distress and disquietude.\"[16]\r\n\r\nA weary and a hopeless time. Branwell came back, better in body, but in\r\nnowise holier in mind. His one hope was that his enemy might die, die\r\nsoon, and that things might be as they had been before. No thought of\r\nrepentance. What money he had, he spent in gin or opium, anything to\r\ndeaden recollection. A woman still lives at Haworth, who used to help in\r\nthe housework at the \"Black Bull.\" She still remembers how, in the early\r\nmorning, pale, red-eyed, he would come into the passage of the inn, with\r\nhis beautiful bow and sweep of the lifted hat, with his courteous smile\r\nand ready \"Good morning, Anne!\" Then he would turn to the bar, and\r\nfeeling in his pockets for what small moneys he might have--sixpence,\r\neightpence, tenpence, as the case might be--he would order so much gin\r\nand sit there drinking till it was all gone, then still sit there\r\nsilent; or sometimes he would passionately speak of the woman he loved,\r\nof her beauty, sweetness, of how he longed to see her again; he loved to\r\nspeak of her even to a dog; he would talk of her by the hour to his dog.\r\nYet--lest we pity this real despair--let us glance at one of this man's\r\nletters. How could such vulgar weakness, such corrupt and loathsome\r\nsentimentality, such maudlin Micawber-penitence, yet feel so much! No\r\neasy task to judge of a misery too perverse for pity, too sincere for\r\nabsolute contempt.\r\n\r\nIt is again to Mr. Grundy that he writes:--\r\n\r\n     \"Since I last shook hands with you in Halifax, two summers\r\n     ago, my life, till lately, has been one of apparent\r\n     happiness and indulgence. You will ask--'Why does he\r\n     complain then?' I can only reply by showing the undercurrent\r\n     of distress which bore my bark to a whirl-pool, despite the\r\n     surface-waves of life that seemed floating me to peace. In a\r\n     letter begun in the spring of 1843\" (_sic_; 1845?) \"and\r\n     never finished owing to incessant attacks of illness, I\r\n     tried to tell you that I was tutor to the son of a wealthy\r\n     gentleman whose wife is sister to the wife of ----, an M.P.,\r\n     and the cousin of Lord ----. This lady (though her husband\r\n     detested me) showed me a degree of kindness which, when I\r\n     was deeply grieved one day at her husband's conduct, ripened\r\n     into declarations of more than ordinary feeling. My\r\n     admiration of her mental and personal attractions, my\r\n     knowledge of her unselfish sincerity, her sweet temper, and\r\n     unwearied care for others, with but unrequited return where\r\n     most should have been given ... although she is seventeen\r\n     years my senior, all combined to an attachment on my part,\r\n     and led to reciprocations which I had little looked for.\r\n     Three months since I received a furious letter from my\r\n     employer, threatening to shoot me if I returned from my\r\n     vacation which I was passing at home; and letters from her\r\n     lady's-maid and physician informed me of the outbreak, only\r\n     checked by her firm courage and resolution that whatever\r\n     harm came to her none should come to me.... I have lain for\r\n     nine long weeks, utterly shattered in body and broken down\r\n     in mind. The probability of her becoming free to give me\r\n     herself and estate never rose to drive away the prospect of\r\n     her decline under her present grief. I dreaded, too, the\r\n     wreck of my mind and body, which--God knows--during a short\r\n     life have been most severely tried. Eleven continuous nights\r\n     of sleepless horror reduced me to almost blindness, and\r\n     being taken into Wales to recover, the sweet scenery, the\r\n     sea, the sound of music caused me fits of unspeakable\r\n     distress. You will say: 'What a fool!' But if you knew the\r\n     many causes that I have for sorrow, which I cannot even\r\n     hint at here, you would perhaps pity as well as blame. At\r\n     the kind request of Mr. Macaulay and Mr. Baines, I have\r\n     striven to arouse my mind by writing something worthy of\r\n     being read, but I really cannot do so. Of course you will\r\n     despise the writer of all this. I can only answer that the\r\n     writer does the same and would not wish to live, if he did\r\n     not hope that work and change may yet restore him.\r\n\r\n     \"Apologising sincerely for what seems like whining egotism,\r\n     and hardly daring to hint about days when, in your company,\r\n     I could sometimes sink the thoughts which 'remind me of\r\n     departed days,' I fear 'departed never to return,' I remain,\r\n     &c.\"[17]\r\n\r\nUnhappy Branwell! some consolation he derives in his utmost sorrow from\r\nthe fact that the lady of his love can employ her own lady's-maid and\r\nphysician to write letters to her exiled lover. It is clear that his\r\npride is gratified by this irregular association with a lord. He can\r\nafford to wait, stupefied with drink and drugs, till that happy time\r\nshall come when he can step forward and claim \"herself and estate,\"\r\nhenceforward Branwell Bronte, Esq., J.P., and a person of position in\r\nthe county. Such paradisal future dawns above this present purgatory of\r\npains and confusion.\r\n\r\nThat phrase concerning \"herself and estate\" is peculiarly apocalyptic.\r\nIt sheds a quite new light upon a fact which, in Mrs. Gaskell's time,\r\nwas regarded as a proof that some remains of conscience still stirred\r\nwithin this miserable fellow. Some months after his dismissal, towards\r\nthe end of this unhappy year of 1845, he met this lady at Harrogate by\r\nappointment. It is said that she proposed a flight together, ready to\r\nforfeit all her grandeur. It was Branwell who advised patience, and a\r\nlittle longer waiting. Maybe, though she herself was dear, \"although\r\nseventeen years my senior,\" \"herself and estate\" was estimably dearer.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he was in earnest, yet it was a question of life and death, of\r\nheaven or hell, with him. If he could not have her, he would have\r\nnothing. He would ruin himself and all he could. Most like, in this rage\r\nof vain despair, some passionate baby that shrieks, and hits, and tears,\r\nconvulsed because it may not have the moon.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that Charlotte's coldness, aggravated by continual outrage\r\non Branwell's part, gradually became contempt and silence. In proportion\r\nas she had exulted in this brother, hoped all for him, did she now\r\nshrink from him, bitterly chill at heart.\r\n\r\n\"I begin to fear,\" she says, the once ambitious sister, \"that he has\r\nrendered himself incapable of filling any respectable station in life.\"\r\nShe cannot ask Ellen to come to see her, because he is in the house.\r\n\"And while _he_ is here, _you_ shall not come. I am more confirmed in\r\nthat resolution the more I see of him. I wish I could say one word to\r\nyou in his favour, but I cannot. I will hold my tongue.\"[18]\r\n\r\nFor some while she hoped that the crisis would pass, and that then--no\r\nmatter how humbly, the more obscurely the better--he would at least earn\r\nhonest bread away from home. Such was not his intention. He professed to\r\nbe too ill to leave Haworth; and ill, no doubt, he was from continual\r\neating of opium, and daily drinking of drams. He stuck to his\r\ncomfortable quarters, to the \"Black Bull\" just across the churchyard,\r\nheedless of what discomfort he gave to others. \"Branwell offers no\r\nprospect of hope,\" says Charlotte, again. \"How can we be more\r\ncomfortable so long as Branwell stays at home and degenerates instead of\r\nimproving? It has been intimated that he would be received again where\r\nhe was formerly stationed if he would behave more steadily, but he\r\nrefuses to make the effort. He will not work, and at home he is a drain\r\non every resource, an impediment to all happiness. But there's no use in\r\ncomplaining----\"\r\n\r\nSmall use indeed; yet once more she forced herself to make the hopeless\r\neffort, after some more than customary outbreak of the man who was\r\ndrinking himself into madness and ruin. She writes in the March of 1846\r\nto her friend and comforter, Ellen:--\r\n\r\n     \"I went into the room where Branwell was, to speak to him,\r\n     about an hour after I got home; it was very forced work to\r\n     address him. I might have spared myself the trouble, as he\r\n     took no notice, and made no reply; he was stupefied. My\r\n     fears were not vain. I hear that he got a sovereign while I\r\n     have been away, under pretence of paying a pressing debt; he\r\n     went immediately and changed it at a public-house, and has\r\n     employed it as was to be expected..., concluded her account\r\n     by saying that he was a 'hopeless being.' It is too true. In\r\n     his present state it is scarcely possible to stay in the\r\n     room where he is.\"[19]\r\n\r\nIt must be about that time that she for ever gave up expostulation or\r\ncomplaint in this matter. \"I will hold my tongue,\" she had said, and she\r\nkept her word. For more than two years she held an utter silence to him;\r\nliving under the same roof, witnessing day by day his ever-deepening\r\ndegradation, no syllable crossed her lips to him. Since she could not\r\n(for the sake of those she loved and might comfort) refuse the loathsome\r\ndaily touch and presence of sin, she endured it, but would have no\r\nfellowship therewith. She had no right over it, it none over her. She\r\nlooked on speechless; that man was dead to her.\r\n\r\nAnne, in whom the fibre of indignation was less strong, followed less\r\nsternly in her sister's wake.\r\n\r\n\"She had,\" says Charlotte in her 'Memoir,' \"in the course of her life\r\nbeen called upon to contemplate, near at hand and for a long time, the\r\nterrible effects of talents misused and faculties abused; hers was\r\nnaturally a sensitive, reserved and dejected nature; what she saw went\r\nvery deeply into her mind; it did her harm.\"\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of this harm, coming undeserved to so dear, frail and\r\ninnocent a creature, absorbed all Charlotte's pity. There was none left\r\nfor Branwell.\r\n\r\nBut there was one woman's heart strong enough in its compassion to bear\r\nthe daily disgusts, weaknesses, sins of Branwell's life, and yet persist\r\nin aid and affection. Night after night, when Mr. Bronte was in bed,\r\nwhen Anne and Charlotte had gone upstairs to their room, Emily still sat\r\nup, waiting. She often had very long to wait in the silent house before\r\nthe staggering tread, the muttered oath, the fumbling hand at the door,\r\nbade her rouse herself from her sad thoughts and rise to let in the\r\nprodigal, and lead him in safety to his rest. But she never wearied in\r\nher kindness. In that silent home, it was the silent Emily who had ever\r\na cheering word for Branwell; it was Emily who still remembered that he\r\nwas her brother, without that remembrance freezing her heart to\r\nnumbness. She still hoped to win him back by love; and the very force\r\nand sincerity of his guilty passion (an additional horror and sin in her\r\nsisters' eyes) was a claim on Emily, ever sympathetic to violent\r\nfeeling. Thus it was she who, more than the others, became familiarised\r\nwith the agony, and doubts, and shame of that tormented soul; and if, in\r\nher little knowledge of the world, she imagined such wrested passions to\r\nbe natural, it is not upon her, of a certainty, that the blame of her\r\npity shall be laid.\r\n\r\nAs the time went on and Branwell grew worse and wilder, it was well for\r\nthe lonely watcher that she was strong. At last he grew ill, and would\r\nbe content to go to bed early and lie there half-stupefied with opium\r\nand drink. One such night, their father and Branwell being in bed, the\r\nsisters came upstairs to sleep. Emily had gone on first into the little\r\npassage room where she still slept, when Charlotte, passing Branwell's\r\npartly-opened door, saw a strange bright flare inside.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Emily!\" she cried, \"the house is on fire!\"\r\n\r\nEmily came out, her fingers at her lips. She had remembered her father's\r\ngreat horror of fire; it was the one dread of a brave man; he would have\r\nno muslin curtains, no light dresses in his house. She came out silently\r\nand saw the flame; then, very white and determined, dashed from her room\r\ndownstairs into the passage, where every night full pails of water\r\nstood. One in each hand she came upstairs. Anne, Charlotte, the young\r\nservant, shrinking against the wall, huddled together in amazed\r\nhorror--Emily went straight on and entered the blazing room. In a short\r\nwhile the bright light ceased to flare. Fortunately the flame had not\r\nreached the woodwork: drunken Branwell, turning in his bed, must have\r\nupset the light on to his sheets, for they and the bed were all on fire,\r\nand he unconscious in the midst when Emily went in, even as Jane Eyre\r\nfound Mr. Rochester. But it was with no reasonable, thankful human\r\ncreature with whom Emily had to deal. After a few long moments, those\r\nstill standing in the passage saw her stagger out, white, with singed\r\nclothes, half-carrying in her arms, half-dragging, her besotted brother.\r\nShe placed him in her bed, and took away the light; then assuring the\r\nhysterical girls that there could be no further danger, she bade them go\r\nand rest--but where she slept herself that night no one remembers now.\r\n\r\nIt must be very soon after this that Branwell began to sleep in his\r\nfather's room. The old man, courageous enough, and conceiving that his\r\npresence might be some slight restraint on the drunken furies of his\r\nunhappy son, persisted in this arrangement, though often enough the\r\ngirls begged him to relinquish it, knowing well enough what risk of life\r\nhe ran. Not infrequently Branwell would declare that either he or his\r\nfather should be dead before the morning; and well might it happen that\r\nin his insensate delirium he should murder the blind old man.\r\n\r\n\"The sisters often listened for the report of a pistol in the dead of\r\nthe night, till watchful eye and hearkening ear grew heavy and dull with\r\nthe perpetual strain upon their nerves. In the mornings young Bronte\r\nwould saunter out, saying with a drunkard's incontinence of speech, 'The\r\npoor old man and I have had a terrible night of it. He does his\r\nbest--the poor old man!--but it's all over with me'\" (whimpering) \"'it's\r\n_her_ fault, _her_ fault.'\"[20]\r\n\r\nAnd in such fatal progress two years went on, bringing the suffering in\r\nthat house ever lower, ever deeper, sinking it day by day from bad to\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Mrs. Gaskell.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: 'Pictures of the Past.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Mrs. Gaskell.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Mrs. Gaskell.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Mrs. Gaskell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nWRITING POETRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Emily Bronte's hands were full of trivial labour, while her heart\r\nwas buried with its charge of shame and sorrow, think not that her mind\r\nwas more at rest. She had always used her leisure to study or create;\r\nand the dreariness of existence made this inner life of hers doubly\r\nprecious now. There is a tiny copy of the 'Poems' of Ellis, Currer, and\r\nActon Bell, which was Emily's own, marked with her name and with the\r\ndate of every poem carefully written under its title, in her own cramped\r\nand tidy writing. It has been of great use to me in classifying the\r\norder of these poems, chiefly hymns to imagination, Emily's \"Comforter,\"\r\nher \"Fairy-love;\" beseeching her to light such a light in the soul that\r\nthe dull clouds of earthly skies may seem of scant significance.\r\n\r\nThe light that should be lit was indeed of supernatural brightness; a\r\nflame from under the earth; a flame of lightning from the skies; a\r\nbeacon of awful warning. Although so much is scarcely evident in these\r\nearly poems, gleaming with fantastic glow-worm fires, fairy\r\nprettinesses, or burning as solemnly and pale as tapers lit in daylight\r\nround a bier, yet, in whatever shape, \"the light that never was on sea\r\nor land,\" the strange transfiguring shine of imagination, is present\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nNo one in the house ever saw what things Emily wrote in the moments of\r\npause from her pastry-making, in those brief sittings under the\r\ncurrants, in those long and lonely watches for her drunken brother. She\r\ndid not write to be read, but only to relieve a burdened heart. \"One\r\nday,\" writes Charlotte in 1850, recollecting the near, vanished past,\r\n\"one day in the autumn of 1845, I accidentally lighted on a manuscript\r\nvolume of verse in my sister Emily's handwriting. Of course I was not\r\nsurprised, knowing that she could and did write verse. I looked it over,\r\nand something more than surprise seized me,--a deep conviction that\r\nthese were not common effusions, not at all like the poetry women\r\ngenerally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and\r\ngenuine. To my ear, they had also a peculiar music, wild, melancholy and\r\nelevating.\"\r\n\r\nVery true; these poems with their surplus of imagination, their\r\ninstinctive music and irregular rightness of form, their sweeping\r\nimpressiveness, effects of landscape, their scant allusions to dogma or\r\nperfidious man, are, indeed, not at all like the poetry women generally\r\nwrite. The hand that painted this single line,\r\n\r\n    \"The dim moon struggling in the sky,\"\r\n\r\nshould have shaken hands with Coleridge. The voice might have sung in\r\nconcert with Blake that sang this single bit of a song:\r\n\r\n    \"Hope was but a timid friend;\r\n      She sat without the grated den,\r\n    Watching how my fate would tend,\r\n      Even as selfish-hearted men.\r\n\r\n    \"She was cruel in her fear;\r\n      Through the bars, one dreary day,\r\n    I looked out to see her there,\r\n      And she turned her face away!\"\r\n\r\nHad the poem ended here it would have been perfect, but it and many more\r\nof these lyrics have the uncertainty of close that usually marks early\r\nwork. Often incoherent, too, the pictures of a dream rapidly succeeding\r\neach other without logical connection; yet scarcely marred by the\r\nincoherence, since the effect they seek to produce is not an emotion,\r\nnot a conviction, but an impression of beauty, or horror, or ecstasy.\r\nThe uncertain outlines are bathed in a vague golden air of imagination,\r\nand are shown to us with the magic touch of a Coleridge, a Leopardi--the\r\ntouch which gives a mood, a scene, with scarce an obvious detail of\r\neither mood or scene. We may not understand the purport of the song, we\r\nunderstand the feeling that prompted the song, as, having done with\r\nreading 'Kubla Khan,' there remains in our mind, not the pictured vision\r\nof palace or dancer, but a personal participation in Coleridge's\r\nheightened fancy, a setting-on of reverie, an impression.\r\n\r\nRead this poem, written in October, 1845--\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"THE PHILOSOPHER.\r\n\r\n    \"Enough of thought, philosopher,\r\n      Too long hast thou been dreaming\r\n    Unlightened, in this chamber drear,\r\n      While summer's sun is beaming!\r\n    Space-sweeping soul, what sad refrain\r\n      Concludes thy musings once again?\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, for the time when I shall sleep\r\n      Without identity,\r\n    And never care how rain may steep,\r\n      Or snow may cover me!\r\n    No promised heaven, these wild desires\r\n      Could all, or half fulfil;\r\n    No threatened hell, with quenchless fires,\r\n      Subdue this quenchless will!\r\n\r\n    \"So said I, and still say the same;\r\n      Still, to my death, will say--\r\n    Three gods, within this little frame,\r\n      Are warring night and day;\r\n    Heaven could not hold them all, and yet\r\n      They all are held in me,\r\n    And must be mine till I forget\r\n      My present entity!\r\n    Oh, for the time, when in my breast\r\n      Their struggles will be o'er!\r\n    Oh, for the day, when I shall rest,\r\n      And never suffer more!\r\n\r\n    \"I saw a spirit, standing, man,\r\n      Where thou dost stand--an hour ago,\r\n    And round his feet three rivers ran,\r\n      Of equal depth, and equal flow--\r\n    A golden stream, and one like blood,\r\n      And one like sapphire seemed to be;\r\n    But, where they joined their triple flood\r\n      It tumbled in an inky sea.\r\n    The spirit sent his dazzling gaze\r\n      Down through that ocean's gloomy night\r\n    Then, kindling all, with sudden blaze,\r\n      The glad deep sparkled wide and bright--\r\n    White as the sun, far, far more fair,\r\n      Than its divided sources were!\r\n\r\n    \"And even for that spirit, seer,\r\n      I've watched and sought my life-time long;\r\n    Sought him in heaven, hell, earth and air--\r\n      An endless search, and always wrong!\r\n    Had I but seen his glorious eye\r\n      _Once_ light the clouds that 'wilder me,\r\n    I ne'er had raised this coward cry\r\n      To cease to think, and cease to be;\r\n    I ne'er had called oblivion blest,\r\n      Nor, stretching eager hands to death,\r\n    Implored to change for senseless rest\r\n      This sentient soul, this living breath--\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, let me die--that power and will\r\n      Their cruel strife may close;\r\n    And conquered good, and conquering ill\r\n      Be lost in one repose!\"\r\n\r\nSome semblance of coherence may, no doubt, be given to this poem by\r\nmaking the three first and the last stanzas to be spoken by the\r\nquestioner, and the fourth by the philosopher. Even so, the subject has\r\nlittle charm. What we care for is the surprising energy with which the\r\nsuccessive images are projected, the earnest ring of the verse, the\r\nimagination which invests all its changes. The man and the philosopher\r\nare but the clumsy machinery of the magic-lantern, the more kept out of\r\nview the better.\r\n\r\n\"Conquered good and conquering ill!\" A thought that must often have\r\nrisen in Emily's mind during this year and those succeeding. A gloomy\r\nthought, sufficiently strange in a country parson's daughter; one\r\ndestined to have a great result in her work.\r\n\r\nOf these visions which make the larger half of Emily's contribution to\r\nthe tiny book, none has a more eerie grace than this day-dream of the\r\n5th of March, 1844, sampled here by a few verses snatched out of their\r\nsetting rudely enough:--\r\n\r\n    \"On a sunny brae, alone I lay\r\n      One summer afternoon;\r\n    It was the marriage-time of May\r\n      With her young lover, June.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"The trees did wave their plumy crests,\r\n      The glad birds carolled clear;\r\n    And I, of all the wedding guests,\r\n      Was only sullen there.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    \"Now, whether it were really so,\r\n      I never could be sure,\r\n    But as in fit of peevish woe,\r\n      I stretched me on the moor,\r\n\r\n    \"A thousand thousand gleaming fires\r\n      Seemed kindling in the air;\r\n    A thousand thousand silvery lyres\r\n      Resounded far and near:\r\n\r\n    \"Methought, the very breath I breathed\r\n      Was full of sparks divine,\r\n    And all my heather-couch was wreathed\r\n      By that celestial shine!\r\n\r\n    \"And, while the wide earth echoing rung\r\n      To their strange minstrelsy,\r\n    The little glittering spirits sung,\r\n      Or seemed to sing, to me.\"\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat they sang is indeed of little moment enough--a strain of the vague\r\npantheistic sentiment common always to poets, but her manner of\r\nrepresenting the little airy symphony is charming. It recalls the\r\nfairy-like brilliance of the moors at sunset, when the sun, slipping\r\nbehind a western hill, streams in level rays on to an opposite crest,\r\ngilding with pale gold the fawn-coloured faded grass; tangled in the\r\nfilm of lilac seeding grasses, spread, like the bloom on a grape, over\r\nall the heath; sparkling on the crisp edges of the heather blooms, pure\r\nwhite, wild-rose colour, shell-tinted, purple; emphasising every\r\ngrey-green spur of the undergrowth of ground-lichen; striking every\r\nscarlet-splashed, white-budded spray of ling: an iridescent, shimmering,\r\ndancing effect of white and pink and purple flowers; of lilac bloom, of\r\ngrey-green and whitish-grey buds and branches, all crisply moving and\r\ndancing together in the breeze on the hilltop. I have quoted that windy\r\nnight in a line--\r\n\r\n    \"The dim moon struggling in the sky.\"\r\n\r\nHere is another verse to show how well she watched from her bedroom's\r\nwide window the grey far-stretching skies above the black far-stretching\r\nmoors--\r\n\r\n    \"And oh, how slow that keen-eyed star\r\n      Has tracked the chilly grey;\r\n    What, watching yet! how very far\r\n      The morning lies away.\"\r\n\r\nSuch direct, vital touches recall well-known passages in 'Wuthering\r\nHeights:' Catharine's pictures of the moors; that exquisite allusion to\r\nGimmerton Chapel bells, not to be heard on the moors in summer when the\r\ntrees are in leaf, but always heard at Wuthering Heights on quiet days\r\nfollowing a great thaw or a season of steady rain.\r\n\r\nBut not, alas! in such fantasy, in such loving intimacy with nature,\r\nmight much of Emily's sorrowful days be passed. Nor was it in her nature\r\nthat all her dreams should be cheerful. The finest songs, the most\r\npeculiarly her own, are all of defiance and mourning, moods so natural\r\nto her that she seems to scarcely need the intervention of words in\r\ntheir confession. The wild, melancholy, and elevating music of which\r\nCharlotte wisely speaks is strong enough to move our very hearts to\r\nsorrow in such verses as the following, things which would not touch us\r\nat all were they written in prose; which have no personal note. Yet\r\nlisten--\r\n\r\n    \"Death! that struck when I was most confiding\r\n      In my certain faith of joy to be--\r\n    Strike again, Time's withered branch dividing\r\n      From the fresh root of Eternity!\r\n\r\n    \"Leaves, upon Time's branch, were growing brightly,\r\n      Full of sap, and full of silver dew;\r\n    Birds beneath its shelter gathered nightly;\r\n      Daily round its flowers the wild bees flew.\r\n\r\n    \"Sorrow passed, and plucked the golden blossom.\"\r\n\r\nSolemn, haunting with a passion infinitely beyond the mere words, the\r\nmere image; because, in some wonderful way, the very music of the verse\r\nimpresses, reminds us, declares the holy inevitable losses of death.\r\n\r\nA finer poem yet is 'Remembrance,' written two years later, in the March\r\nof 1845; here the words and the thought are worthy of the music and the\r\nmood. It has vital passion in it; though it can scarcely be personal\r\npassion, since, \"fifteen wild Decembers\" before 1845, Emily Bronte was a\r\ngirl of twelve years old, companionless, save for still living sisters,\r\nBranwell, her aunt, and the vicarage servants. Here, as elsewhere in the\r\npresent volume, the creative instinct reveals itself in imagining\r\nemotions and not characters. The artist has supplied the passion of the\r\nlover.\r\n\r\n    \"Cold in the earth--and the deep snow piled above thee,\r\n      Far, far removed, cold in the dreary grave!\r\n    Have I forgot, my only Love, to love thee,\r\n      Severed at last by Time's all-severing wave?\r\n\r\n    \"Now, when alone, do my thoughts no longer hover\r\n      Over the mountains, on that northern shore,\r\n    Resting their wings where heath and fern-leaves cover\r\n      Thy noble heart for ever, evermore?\r\n\r\n    \"Cold in the earth--and fifteen wild Decembers,\r\n      From those brown hills, have melted into spring:\r\n    Faithful, indeed, is the spirit that remembers\r\n      After such years of change and suffering!\r\n\r\n    \"Sweet Love of youth, forgive, if I forget thee,\r\n      While the world's tide is bearing me along;\r\n    Other desires and other hopes beset me,\r\n      Hopes which obscure, but cannot do thee wrong.\r\n\r\n    \"No later light has lightened up my heaven,\r\n      No second morn has ever shone for me;\r\n    All my life's bliss from thy dear life was given,\r\n      All my life's bliss is in the grave with thee.\r\n\r\n    \"But, when the days of golden dreams had perished,\r\n      And even Despair was powerless to destroy,\r\n    Then did I learn how existence could be cherished,\r\n      Strengthened, and fed without the aid of joy.\r\n\r\n    \"Then did I check the tears of useless passion--\r\n      Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine;\r\n    Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten\r\n      Down to that tomb already more than mine.\r\n\r\n    \"And, even yet, I dare not let it languish,\r\n      Dare not indulge in memory's rapturous pain;\r\n    Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish,\r\n      How could I seek the empty world again?\"\r\n\r\nBetter still, of a standard excellence, is a little poem, which, by some\r\nshy ostrich prompting, Emily chose to call\r\n\r\n    \"THE OLD STOIC.\r\n\r\n    \"Riches I hold in light esteem;\r\n      And Love I laugh to scorn;\r\n    And lust of fame was but a dream\r\n      That vanished with the morn:\r\n\r\n    \"And if I pray, the only prayer\r\n      That moves my lips for me\r\n    Is, 'Leave the heart that now I bear,\r\n      And give me liberty!'\r\n\r\n    \"Yes, as my swift days near their goal,\r\n      'Tis all that I implore;\r\n    In life and death, a chainless soul,\r\n      With courage to endure.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the book one recognises the capacity for producing something\r\nfiner and quite different from what is here produced; one recognises so\r\nmuch, but not the author of 'Wuthering Heights.' Grand impressions of\r\nmood and landscape reveal a remarkably receptive artistic temperament;\r\nsplendid and vigorous movement of lines shows that the artist is a poet.\r\nThen we are in a _cul-de-sac_. There is no hint of what kind of\r\npoet--too reserved to be consistently lyric, there is not sufficient\r\nevidence of the dramatic faculty to help us on to the true scent. All we\r\ncan say is that we have before us a mind capable of very complete and\r\nreal illusions, haunted by imagination, always fantastic, and often\r\nterrible; a temperament reserved, fearless and brooding; a character of\r\ngreat strength and ruggedness, extremely tenacious of impressions. We\r\nmust call in Monsieur Taine and his _Milieu_ to account for 'Wuthering\r\nHeights.'\r\n\r\nThis first volume reveals an overpowering imagination which has not yet\r\nreached its proper outlet. It is painful, in reading these early poems,\r\nto feel how ruthless and horrible that strong imagination often was, as\r\nyet directed on no purposed line. Sometimes, indeed, sweet fancies came\r\nto Emily, but often they were visions of black dungeons, scenes of\r\ndeath, and hopeless parting, of madness and agony.\r\n\r\n    \"So stood I, in Heaven's glorious sun,\r\n      And in the glare of Hell;\r\n    My spirit drank a mingled tone,\r\n      Of seraph's song, and demon's moan;\r\n    What my soul bore, my soul alone\r\n      Within itself may tell!\"\r\n\r\nIt is painful, indeed, to think that the surroundings of this violent\r\nimagination, with its bias towards the capricious and the terrifying,\r\nwere loneliness, sorrow, enforced companionship with degradation; a life\r\nso bitter, for a long time, and made so bitter through another's fault,\r\nthat Emily welcomed her fancies, even the gloomiest, as a happy outlet\r\nfrom reality.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, dreadful is the check--intense the agony--\r\n    When the ear begins to hear, and the eye begins to see;\r\n    When the pulse begins to throb, the brain to think again,\r\n    The soul to feel the flesh, and the flesh to feel the chain.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the verses that Charlotte discovered one autumn day of 1845,\r\nwhich surprised her, with good reason, by their originality and music.\r\nEmily was not pleased by what in her eyes, so jealous of her liberty,\r\nmust have seemed a deliberate interference with her property. \"My sister\r\nEmily,\" continues Charlotte, \"was not a person of demonstrative\r\ncharacter, nor one on the recesses of whose mind and feelings even those\r\nnearest and dearest to her could intrude unlicensed; it took hours to\r\nreconcile her to the discovery I had made, and days to persuade her that\r\nsuch poems merited publication. I knew, however, that a mind like hers\r\ncould not be without some latent spark of honourable ambition, and\r\nrefused to be discouraged in my attempts to fan that spark to flame.\r\n\r\n\"Meantime, my younger sister quietly produced some of her own\r\ncompositions, intimating that since Emily's had given me pleasure, I\r\nmight like to look at some of hers. I could not but be a partial judge,\r\nyet I thought that these verses, too, had a sweet sincere pathos of\r\ntheir own.\"\r\n\r\nOnly a partial judge could find anything much to praise in gentle Anne's\r\ntrivial verses. Had the book an index of first lines, what a scathing\r\ncriticism on the contents would it be!\r\n\r\n    \"Sweet are thy strains, celestial bard.\"\r\n    \"I'll rest me in this sheltered bower.\"\r\n    \"Oh, I am very weary, though tears no longer flow.\"\r\n\r\nFrom such beginnings we too clearly foresee the hopeless bathos of the\r\nend. Poor child, her real, deep sorrows, expressed in such worn-out\r\nill-fitting phrases, are as little touching as the beauty of a London\r\nshopgirl under the ready-made cast-off adornments of her second-hand\r\nfinery.\r\n\r\nCharlotte, however, knowing the real sorrow, the real meekness that\r\ninspired them, not unnaturally put into the trivial verses the pathos of\r\nthe writer's circumstances. Of a truth, her own poems are not such as\r\nwould justify any great rigour of criticism. They are often, as poems,\r\nactually inferior to Anne's, her manner of dragging in a tale or a moral\r\nat the end of a lyric having quite a comical effect; yet, on the whole,\r\nher share of the book clearly distinguishes her as an eloquent and\r\nimaginative _raconteuse_, at the same time that it denies her the least\r\nsprout, the smallest leaf, of that flowerless wreath of bays which Emily\r\nmight claim. But at that time the difference was not so clearly\r\ndistinguishable; though Charlotte ever felt and owned her sister's\r\nsuperiority in this respect, it was not recognised as of a sort to quite\r\noutshine her own little tales in verse, and quite outlustre Anne's pious\r\neffusions.\r\n\r\nA packet of manuscript was selected, a little packet written in three\r\ndifferent hands and signed by three names. The sisters did not wish to\r\nreveal their identity; they decided on a _nom de plume_, and chose the\r\ncommon north-country surname of Bell. They did not wish to be known as\r\nwomen: \"we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be\r\nlooked on with prejudices;\" yet their fastidious honour prevented them\r\nfrom wearing a mask they had no warrant for; to satisfy both scruples\r\nthey assumed names that might equally belong to a man or a woman. In the\r\npart of Yorkshire where they lived children are often christened by\r\nfamily names; over the shops they would see \"Sunderland Akroyd,\" varied\r\nby \"Pighills Sunderland,\" with scarce a John or James to bear them\r\ncompany. So there was nothing strange to them in the fashion so\r\ningeniously turned to their own uses. Ellis veiled Emily; Currer,\r\nCharlotte; Acton, Anne. The first and last are common names enough--a\r\nMiss Currer who was one of the subscribers to Cowan's Bridge may have\r\nsuggested her pseudonym to Charlotte. At last every detail was\r\ndiscussed, decided, and the packet sent off to London to try its\r\nfortunes in the world:--\r\n\r\n\"This bringing out of our little book was hard work. As was to be\r\nexpected neither we nor our poems were at all wanted; but for this we\r\nhad been prepared at the outset; though inexperienced ourselves, we had\r\nread the experience of others. The great puzzle lay in the difficulty of\r\ngetting answers of any kind from the publishers to whom we applied.\r\nBeing greatly harassed by this obstacle, I ventured to apply to the\r\nMessrs. Chambers of Edinburgh for a word of advice: _they_ may have\r\nforgotten the circumstance, but _I_ have not; for from them I received a\r\nbrief and business-like but civil and sensible reply, on which we acted,\r\nand at last made a way.\"[21]\r\n\r\nUltimately the three sisters found a publisher who would undertake the\r\nwork upon commission; a favourable answer came from Messrs. Aylott &\r\nJones, of Paternoster Row, who estimated the expense of the book at\r\nthirty guineas. It was a great deal for the three sisters to spare from\r\ntheir earnings, but they were eager to print, eager to make sacrifices,\r\nas though in some dim way they saw already the glorious goal. But at\r\npresent there was business to do. They bought one of the numerous little\r\nprimers that are always on sale to show the poor vain moth of amateur\r\nauthorship how least to burn his wings--little books more eagerly bought\r\nand read than any of those that they bring into the world. Such a\r\npublisher's guide, meant for ambitious schoolboys, the Brontes bought\r\nand studied as anxiously as they. By the end of February all was\r\nsettled, the type decided upon, the money despatched, the printers at\r\nwork. Emily Bronte's copy is dated May 7th, 1846.\r\n\r\nWhat eagerness at the untying of the parcel in which those first copies\r\ncame! What disappointment, chequered with ecstasy, at reading their own\r\nverse, unaltered, yet in print! An experience not so common then as now;\r\nto be a poetess in those days had a certain distinction, and the three\r\nsisters must have anxiously waited for a greeting. The poems had been\r\ndespatched to many magazines: _Colburne's_, _Bentley's_, _Hood's_,\r\n_Jerrold's_, _Blackwood's_, their early idol; to the _Edinburgh Review_,\r\n_Tait's Edinburgh Magazine_, the _Dublin University Magazine_; to the\r\n_Athenaeum_, the _Literary Gazette_, the _Critic_, and to the _Daily\r\nNews_, the _Times_, and to the _Britannia_ newspaper. Surely from some\r\nquarter they would hear such an authentic word of warning or welcome as\r\nshould confirm at once their hopes or their despairs. They had grown\r\nused to waiting; but they had long to wait. At last, on July 4th, the\r\n_Athenaeum_ reviewed their book in a short paragraph, and it is\r\nremarkable that, though in such reviews of the poems as appeared after\r\nthe publication of 'Jane Eyre,' it is always Currer Bell's \"fine sense\r\nof nature,\" Currer Bell's \"matured intellect and masterly hand,\" that\r\nwins all the praise; still, in this early notice, the yet unblinded\r\ncritic has perceived to whom the palm is due. Ellis Bell he places\r\nfirst of the three supposed brothers, naming him \"a fine quaint spirit\r\nwith an evident power of wing that may reach heights not here\r\nattempted.\" Next to him the critic ranks Currer, lastly Anne. Scarce\r\nanother notice did they see.\r\n\r\nThe little book was evidently a failure; it had fallen still-born from\r\nthe press. Were all their hopes to die as soon as they were born? At\r\nleast they resolved not to be too soon baffled, and already, in the\r\nthick of their disappointment, began to lay the plots of the novels they\r\nwould write. Like our army, they gained their battles by never owning\r\nthey were beaten.\r\n\r\nThey kept it all to themselves, this disappointment, these resolutions.\r\nWhen the inquisitive postman asked Mr. Bronte if he knew who was that\r\nMr. Currer Bell for whom so many letters always came, the old gentleman\r\nanswered with a sense of authority, \"My good man, there is no such\r\nperson in the parish;\" and when, on rare occasions, Branwell came into\r\nthe room where they were writing, no word was said of the work that was\r\ngoing on. Not even to the sisterly Ellen, so near to all their hearts,\r\nwas any confession made of the way they spent their time.\r\n\r\n\"We have done nothing (to _speak_ of) since you were here,\" says\r\nconscientious Anne. Nevertheless their friend drew her conclusions.\r\nAbout this time she came to stay at Haworth, and sometimes (a little\r\namused at their reticence) she would tease them with her suspicions, to\r\nCharlotte's alarmed surprise. Once, at this time, when they were walking\r\non the moor together, a sudden change and light came into the sky.\r\n\"Look,\" said Charlotte; and the four girls looked up and saw three suns\r\nshining clearly overhead. They stood a little while silently gazing at\r\nthe beautiful parhelion; Charlotte, her friend, and Anne clustered\r\ntogether, Emily a little higher, standing on a heathery knoll. \"That is\r\nyou!\" said Ellen at last. \"You are the three suns.\" \"Hush!\" cried\r\nCharlotte, indignant at the too shrewd nonsense of her friend; but as\r\nEllen, her suspicions confirmed by Charlotte's violence, lowered her\r\neyes to the earth again, she looked a moment at Emily. She was still\r\nstanding on her knoll, quiet, satisfied; and round her lips there\r\nhovered a very soft and happy smile. She was not angry, the independent\r\nEmily. She had liked the little speech.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: 'Memoir.' C. B.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTROUBLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Emily Bronte was striving to create a world of fancy and romance\r\nnatural to her passionate spirit, the real, everyday existence in which\r\nshe had to work and endure was becoming day by day more anxious and\r\ntroubled. An almost unliveable life it seems, recalling it, stifled with\r\nthe vulgar tragedy of Branwell's woes, the sordid cares that his debts\r\nentailed, the wearing anxiety that watched the oncoming blindness of old\r\nMr. Bronte. These months of 1846 during which, let us remember, Emily\r\nwas writing 'Wuthering Heights,' must have been the heaviest and\r\ndreariest of her days; it was during their weary course that she at last\r\nperceived how utterly hopeless, how insensible to good, must be the\r\nremaining life of her brother.\r\n\r\nFor so long as the future was left him, Branwell never reached the limit\r\nof abasement. He drank to drown sorrow, to deaden memory and the flight\r\nof time; he went far, but not too far to turn back when the day should\r\ndawn which should recall him to prosperity and happiness. He was still,\r\nthough perverted and debased, capable of reform and susceptible to holy\r\ninfluences. He had not finally cast away goodness and honour; they were\r\nbut momentarily discarded, like rings taken off for heavy work;\r\nby-and-by he would put them on again.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the future was taken away. One morning, about six months after\r\nhis dismissal, a letter came for Branwell announcing the death of his\r\nformer employer. All he had ever hoped for lay at his feet--the good,\r\nwronged man was dead. His wife, his wealth, should now make Branwell\r\nglad. A new life, earned by sin and hatred, should begin; a new good\r\nlife, honourable and happy. It was in Branwell's nature to be glad when\r\npeace and honour came to him, although he would make no effort to attain\r\nthem, and this morning he was very happy.\r\n\r\n\"He fair danced down the churchyard as if he were out of his mind; he\r\nwas so fond of that woman,\" says my informant.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he rose, dressed himself with care, and prepared for a\r\njourney, but before he had even set out from Haworth two men came riding\r\nto the village post haste. They sent for Branwell, and when he arrived,\r\nin a great state of excitement, one of the riders dismounted and went\r\nwith him into the \"Black Bull.\" They went into the brown parlour of the\r\ninn, the cheerful, wainscotted parlour, where Branwell had so often\r\nlorded it over his boon companions from his great three-cornered chair.\r\nAfter some time the messenger rose and left; and those who were in the\r\ninn thought they heard a strange noise in the parlour--a bleating like a\r\ncalf's. Yet, being busy people, they did not go in to see if anything\r\nhad happened, and amid the throng of their employments the sound passed\r\nout of their ears and out of their memory. Hours afterwards the young\r\ngirl who used to help in the housework at the inn, the Anne who still\r\nremembers Branwell's fluent greetings, found occasion to enter the\r\nparlour. She went in and found him on the floor, looking changed and\r\ndreadful. He had fallen down in a sort of stupefied fit. After that day\r\nhe was an altered being.\r\n\r\nThe message he had heard had changed the current of his life. It was not\r\nthe summons he expected; but a prayer from the woman he loved not to\r\ncome near her, not to tempt her to ruin; if she saw him once, the care\r\nof her children, the trust of their fortunes, all was forfeited. She\r\nentreated him to keep away; anxious, perhaps, in this sudden loneliness\r\nof death, to retrieve the past, or by some tender superstition made less\r\nwilling to betray the dead than the living; or, it may be, merely eager\r\nto retain at all costs the rank, the station, the honours to which she\r\nwas accustomed. Be it as it may, Branwell found himself forgotten.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, dreadful heart of woman,\r\n    That in one day forgets what man remembers,\r\n    Forgetting him therewith.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that day he was different. He despaired, and drank himself to\r\ndeath, drinking to the grave and forgetfulness, gods of his Sabbath, and\r\nborrowing a transient pleasure at fearful interest. But to such a man\r\nthe one supreme temptation is enjoyment: it must be had, though life and\r\nheaven go forfeit. And while he caroused, \"and by his whole manner gave\r\nindications of intense enjoyment,\"[22] his old father grew quite blind,\r\nAnne day by day more delicate and short of breath, ambitious Charlotte\r\npined like an eagle in a cage, and Emily, writing 'Wuthering Heights,'\r\ncalled those affected who found the story more terrible than life.\r\n\r\nIt was she who saw most of her abandoned brother, for Anne could only\r\nshudder at his sin, and Charlotte was too indignant for pity. But Emily,\r\nthe stern, charitable woman, who spared herself no pang, who loved to\r\ncarry tenderly the broken-winged nestlings in her hardworking hands,\r\nEmily was not revolted by his weakness. Shall I despise the deer for his\r\ntimid swiftness to fly, or the leveret because it cannot die bravely, or\r\nmock the death-agony of the wolf because the beast is gaunt and foul to\r\nsee? she asks herself in one of the few personal poems she has left us.\r\nNo! An emphatic no; for Emily Bronte had a place in her heart for all\r\nthe wild children of nature, and to despise them for their natural\r\ninstincts was impossible to her. And thus it came about that she ceased\r\nto grow indignant at Branwell's follies; she made up her mind to accept\r\nwith angerless sorrow his natural vices. All that was left of her ready\r\ndisdain was an extreme patience which expected no reform, asked no\r\nimprovement; the patience she had for the leveret and the wolf, things\r\ncontemptible and full of harm, yet not so by their own choice; the\r\npatience of acquiescent and hopeless despair.\r\n\r\nBranwell's pity was all for himself. He did not spare the pious\r\nhousehold forced into the contamination of his evil habits. \"Nothing\r\nhappens at Haworth,\" says Charlotte; \"nothing at least of a pleasant\r\nkind. One little incident occurred about a week ago to sting us into\r\nlife; but, if it give no more pleasure for you to hear than it does for\r\nus to witness, you will scarcely thank me for adverting to it. It was\r\nmerely the arrival of a sheriff's officer on a visit to Branwell,\r\ninviting him either to pay his debts or take a trip to York. Of course\r\nhis debts had to be paid. It is not agreeable to lose money, time after\r\ntime, in this way; but where is the use of dwelling on such subjects. It\r\nwill make him no better.\"[23]\r\n\r\nReproaches only hardened his heart and made him feel himself more than\r\never abused by circumstances and fate. \"Sometimes,\"[24] says Mr.\r\nPhillips, \"he would complain of the way he was treated at home, and, as\r\nan instance, related the following:--\r\n\r\n\"One of the Sunday-school girls, in whom he and all his house took much\r\ninterest, fell very sick, and they were afraid she would not live.\r\n\r\n\"'I went to see the poor little thing,' he said, 'sat with her\r\nhalf-an-hour and read a psalm to her and a hymn at her request. I felt\r\nvery much like praying with her too,' he added, his voice trembling with\r\nemotion, 'but you see I was not good enough. How dare I pray for\r\nanother, who had almost forgotten how to pray for myself? I came away\r\nwith a heavy heart, for I felt sure she would die, and went straight\r\nhome, where I fell into melancholy musings. I wanted somebody to cheer\r\nme. I often do; but no kind word finds its way to my ears, much less to\r\nmy heart. Charlotte observed my depression, and asked what ailed me. So\r\nI told her. She looked at me with a look which I shall never forget, if\r\nI live to be a hundred years old--which I never shall. It was not like\r\nher at all. It wounded me, as if some one had struck me a blow in the\r\nmouth. It involved ever so many things in it. It was a dubious look. It\r\nran over me, questioning and examining, as if I had been a wild beast.\r\nIt said, 'Did my ears deceive me, or did I hear ought?' And then came\r\nthe painful, baffled expression which was worse than all. It said, 'I\r\nwonder if that's true?' But, as she left the room, she seemed to accuse\r\nherself of having wronged me, and smiled kindly upon me and said, 'She\r\nis my little scholar and I will go and see her.' I replied not a word. I\r\nwas too much cut up. When she was gone, I came over here to the \"Black\r\nBull\" and made a night of it in sheer disgust and desperation. Why could\r\nthey not give me some credit when I was trying to be good?'\"\r\n\r\nIn such wise the summer of 1846 drew on, wearily enough, with increased\r\neconomies in the already frugal household, that Branwell's debts might\r\nhonourably be paid, with gathering fears for the father, on whom\r\ndyspepsia and blindness were laying heavy hands. He could no longer see\r\nto read; he, the great walker who loved to ramble alone, could barely\r\ngrope his way about; all that was left to him of sight was the ability\r\nto recognise well-known figures standing in a strong light. Yet he still\r\ncontinued to preach; standing grey and sightless in the pulpit, uttering\r\nwhat words (perforce unstudied) came to his lips. Himself in his\r\nsorrowful age and stern endurance a most noble and comprehensible\r\nsermon.\r\n\r\nHis spirits were much depressed; for now he could no longer forget\r\nhimself in his lonely studies, no longer walk on the free moors alone\r\nwhen trouble invaded the narrow house below. He lived now of necessity\r\nin intimate relation with his children; he depended on them. And now he\r\nmade acquaintance with the heroic nature of his daughters, and saw the\r\npetty drudgery of their lives, and how worthily they turned it to a\r\ngrace in the wearing of it. And now he saw clearly the vain, dependent,\r\npassionate temperament of his son, and knew how, by the lack of\r\ntraining, the plant had been ruined and draggled in the mire, which\r\nmight have beautifully flowered and borne good fruit had it been staked\r\nand supported; the poor espalier thing that could not stand alone.\r\nNemesis had visited his home. He felt the consequences of his\r\nselfishness, his arrogance, his cold isolation, and bitterly, bitterly\r\nhe mourned.\r\n\r\nThe cataract grew month by month, a thickening veil that blotted out\r\nthe world; and month by month the old blind man sat wearily thinking\r\nthrough the day of his dear son's ruin, for he had ever loved Branwell\r\nthe best, and lay at night listening for his footsteps; while below,\r\nalone, his daughter watched as wearily for the prodigal's return.\r\n\r\nThe three girls looked on and longed to help. All that they could do\r\nthey did, Charlotte being her father's constant helper and companion;\r\nbut all they could do was little. They would not reconcile themselves to\r\nsee him sink into blindness. They busied themselves in collecting what\r\ninformation they could glean concerning operations upon cataract, and\r\nthe names of oculists. But at present there was nothing to do but wait\r\nand endure; for even they, with their limited knowledge, could tell that\r\ntheir father's eyes were not ready yet for the surgeon's knife.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile they worked in secret at their novels. So soon as the poems\r\nhad been sent off, and even when it was evident that that venture, too,\r\nhad failed, the sisters determined to try and earn a livelihood by\r\nwriting. They could no longer leave their home, their father being\r\nhelpless and Branwell worse than helpless; yet, with ever-increasing\r\nexpenses and no earnings, bare living was difficult to compass. The\r\nfuture, too, was uncertain; should their father's case prove hopeless,\r\nshould he become quite blind, ill, incapable of work, they would be\r\nhomeless indeed. With such gloomy boding in their hearts, with such\r\nstern impelling necessity bidding them strive and ever strive again, as\r\na baffled swimmer strives for land, these three sisters began their\r\nwork. Two of them, in after time, were to be known through all the\r\nworld, were to be influences for all time to come and, a new glory in\r\nthe world not known before their days, were to make up \"with Mrs.\r\nBrowning, the perfect trinity of English female fame.\"[25] But with\r\nlittle thought of this, heavily and very wearily, they set out upon\r\ntheir undertaking.\r\n\r\nEvery evening when the sewing was put away the writing was begun, the\r\nthree sisters, sitting round the table, or more often marching round and\r\nround the room as in their schoolgirl days, would hold solemn council\r\nover the progress of their work. The division of chapters, the naming of\r\ncharacters, the progress of events, was then decided, so that each lent\r\na hand to the other's work. Then, such deliberations done, the paper\r\nwould be drawn out, and the casual notes of the day corrected and writ\r\nfair; and for an hour or more there would be no sound save the\r\nscratching of pens on the paper and the gusty wailing of the wind\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nSuch methodical work makes rapid progress. In a few months each sister\r\nhad a novel completed. Charlotte, a grave and quiet study of Belgian\r\nlife and character, 'The Professor;' Anne, a painstaking account of a\r\ngoverness's trials, which she entitled 'Agnes Grey.' Emily's story was\r\nvery different, and less perceptibly interwoven with her own experience.\r\nWe all know at least the name of 'Wuthering Heights.'\r\n\r\nThe novels were sent off, and at first seemed even less likely of\r\nsuccess than the school had been, or the book of verses. Publisher after\r\npublisher rejected them; then, thinking that perhaps it was not cunning\r\nto send the three novels in a batch, since the ill-success of one might\r\nprejudice all, the sisters sent them separately to try their chance. But\r\never with the same result--month after month, came rejection.\r\n\r\nAt home affairs continued no less disheartening. Branwell often laid up\r\nwith violent fits of sickness, Mr. Bronte becoming more utterly blind.\r\nAt last, in the end of July, Emily and Charlotte set out for Manchester\r\nto consult an oculist. There they heard of Mr. Wilson as the best, and\r\nto him they went; but only to find that no decisive opinion could be\r\ngiven until their father's eyes had been examined. Yet, not\r\ndisheartened, they went back to Haworth; for at least they had\r\ndiscovered a physician and had made sure that, even at their father's\r\nadvanced age, an operation might prove successful. Therefore, at the end\r\nof August, Charlotte, who was her father's chief companion and the most\r\neasily spared from home, took old Mr. Bronte to Manchester. Mr. Wilson\r\npronounced his eyes ready for the operation, and the old man and his\r\ndaughter went into lodgings for a month. \"I wonder how Emily and Anne\r\nwill get on at home with Branwell,\" says Charlotte, accustomed to be the\r\nguide and leader of that little household.\r\n\r\nHardly enough, no doubt; for Anne was little fitted now to struggle\r\nagainst fate. She never had completely rallied from the prolonged misery\r\nof her sojourn with Branwell in that fatal house which was to blight\r\ntheir future and be blighted by them. She grew weaker and weaker, that\r\n\"gentle little one,\" so tender, so ill fitted to her rugged and gloomy\r\npath of life. Emily looked on with a breaking heart; trouble encompassed\r\nher on every side; her father blind in Manchester; her brother drinking\r\nhimself to death at home; her sister failing, paling day by day; and\r\nevery now and then a letter would come announcing that such and such a\r\nfirm of publishers had no use for 'Agnes Grey' and 'Wuthering Heights.'\r\n\r\nCharlotte in Manchester fared little better. 'The Professor' had been\r\nreturned to her on the very day of her father's operation, when\r\n(bearing this unspoken-of blow as best she might) she had to stay in the\r\nroom while the cataract was removed from his eyes. Exercise makes\r\ncourage strong; that evening, when her father in his darkened room might\r\nno longer speak or be spoken to, that very evening she began 'Jane\r\nEyre.'\r\n\r\nThis was being braver than brave Emily, who has left us nothing, save a\r\nfew verses, written later than 'Wuthering Heights.' But at Haworth there\r\nwas labour and to spare for every instant of the busy days, and\r\nCharlotte, in Manchester, found her unaccustomed leisure and unoccupied\r\nconfinement very dreary.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of September Mr. Bronte was pronounced on a fair way to\r\nrecovery, and he and Charlotte set out for Haworth. It was a happy\r\nhome-coming, for things had prospered better than Charlotte had dared to\r\nhope during the latter weeks of her absence. Every day the old man grew\r\nstronger, and little by little his sight came back. He could see the\r\nglorious purple of the moors, Emily's moors, no less beloved in her\r\nsorrowing womanhood than in her happy hoyden time of youth. He could see\r\nhis children's faces, and the miserable change in Branwell's features.\r\nHe began to be able to read a little, a very little at a time, and by\r\nNovember was sufficiently recovered to take the whole duty of the three\r\nSunday services upon himself.\r\n\r\nNot long after this time, three members of that quiet household were\r\nstill further cheered by learning that 'Agnes Grey' and 'Wuthering\r\nHeights' had found acceptance at the hands of a publisher. Acceptance;\r\nbut upon impoverishing terms. Still, for so much they were thankful. To\r\nwrite, and bury unread the things one has written, is playing music upon\r\na dumb piano.

One brother, scarce less dear, of set purpose drinking himself to\r\ndeath out of furious thwarted passion for a mistress that he might not\r\nmarry: these were the members of Emily Bronte's household.\r\n\r\nHerself we know: inexperienced, courageous, passionate, and full of\r\npity. Was it wonderful that she summed up life in one bitter line?--\r\n\r\n    \"Conquered good and conquering ill.\"\r\n\r\nHer own circumstances proved the axiom true, and of other lives she had\r\nbut little knowledge. Whom should she ask? The gentle Ellen who seemed\r\nof another world, and yet had plentiful troubles of her own? The curates\r\nshe despised for their narrow priggishness? The people in the village of\r\nwhom she knew nothing save when sickness, wrong, or death summoned her\r\nto their homes to give help and protection? Her life had given only one\r\nview of the world, and she could not realise that there were others\r\nwhich she had not seen.\r\n\r\n\"I am bound to avow,\" says Charlotte, \"that she had scarcely more\r\npractical knowledge of the peasantry among whom she lived than a nun has\r\nof the country people that pass her convent gates. My sister's\r\ndisposition was not naturally gregarious; circumstances favoured and\r\nfostered her tendency to seclusion; except to go to church, or to take a\r\nwalk on the hills, she rarely crossed the threshold of home. Though her\r\nfeeling for the people round her was benevolent, intercourse with them\r\nshe never sought, nor, with very few exceptions, ever experienced; and\r\nyet she knew them, knew their ways, their language, their family\r\nhistories; she could hear of them with interest and talk of them with\r\ndetail, minute, graphic, and accurate; but with them she rarely\r\nexchanged a word. Hence it ensued that what her mind had gathered of the\r\nreal concerning them was too exclusively confined to those tragic and\r\nterrible traits of which, in listening to the secret annals of every\r\nrude vicinage, the memory is sometimes compelled to receive the impress.\r\nHer imagination, which was a spirit more sombre than sunny, more\r\npowerful than sportive, found in such traits materials whence it wrought\r\ncreations like Heathcliff, like Earnshaw, like Catharine. Having formed\r\nthese beings she did not know what she had done. If the auditors of her\r\nwork, when read in manuscript, shuddered under the grinding influence of\r\nnatures so relentless and implacable--of spirits so lost and fallen; if\r\nit was complained that the mere hearing of certain vivid and fearful\r\nscenes banished sleep by night and disturbed mental peace by day, Ellis\r\nBell would wonder what was meant and suspect the complainant of\r\naffectation. Had she but lived, her mind would of itself have grown like\r\na strong tree--loftier and straighter, wider spreading--and its matured\r\nfruits would have attained a mellower ripening and sunnier bloom; but on\r\nthat mind time and experience alone could work, to the influence of\r\nother intellects it was not amenable.\"[26]\r\n\r\nYet no human being is wholly free, none wholly independent, of\r\nsurroundings. And Emily Bronte least of all could claim such immunity.\r\nWe can with difficulty just imagine her a prosperous heiress, loving and\r\nloved, high-spirited and even hoydenish; but with her cavalier fantasy\r\ninformed by a gracious splendour all her own, we can just imagine Emily\r\nBronte as Shirley Keeldar, but scarcely Shirley Keeldar writing\r\n'Wuthering Heights.' Emily Bronte away from her moors, her loneliness,\r\nher poverty, her discipline, her companionship with genius, violence and\r\ndegradation, would have taken another colour, as hydrangeas grow now\r\nred, now blue, according to the nature of the soil. It was not her lack\r\nof knowledge of the world that made the novel she wrote become\r\n'Wuthering Heights,' not her inexperience, but rather her experience,\r\nlimited and perverse, indeed, and specialised by a most singular\r\ntemperament, yet close and very real. Her imagination was as much\r\ninspired by the circumstances of her life, as was Anne's when she wrote\r\nthe 'Tenant of Wildfell Hall,' or Charlotte's in her masterpiece\r\n'Villette;' but, as in each case the imagination was of a different\r\nquality, experience, acting upon it, produced a distinct and dissimilar\r\nresult; a result obtained no less by the contrariety than by the harmony\r\nof circumstance. For our surroundings affect us in two ways; subtly and\r\npermanently, tinging us through and through as wine tinges water, or, by\r\nsome violent neighbourhood of antipathetic force, sending us off at a\r\ntangent as far as possible from the antagonistic presence that so\r\ndetestably environs us. The fact that Charlotte Bronte knew chiefly\r\nclergymen is largely responsible for 'Shirley,' that satirical eulogy of\r\nthe Church and apotheosis of Sunday-school teachers. But Emily, living\r\nin this same clerical evangelistic atmosphere, is revolted, forced to\r\nthe other extreme; and, while sheltering her true opinions from herself\r\nunder the all-embracing term \"Broad Church,\" we find in her writings no\r\nbelief so strong as the belief in the present use and glory of life; no\r\nlove so great as her love for earth--earth the mother and grave; no\r\nassertion of immortality, but a deep certainty of rest. There is no note\r\nso often struck in all her work, and struck with such variety of\r\nemphasis, as this: that good for goodness' sake is desirable, evil for\r\nevil's sake detestable, and that for the just and the unjust alike there\r\nis rest in the grave.\r\n\r\nThis quiet clergyman's daughter, always hearing evil of Dissenters, has\r\ntherefore from pure courage and revolted justice become a dissenter\r\nherself. A dissenter in more ways than one. Never was a nature more\r\nsensitive to the stupidities and narrowness of conventional opinion, a\r\nnature more likely to be found in the ranks of the opposition; and with\r\nsuch a nature indignation is the force that most often looses the gate\r\nof speech. The impulse to reveal wrongs and sufferings as they really\r\nare, is overwhelmingly strong; although the revelation itself be\r\nimperfect. What, then, would this inexperienced Yorkshire parson's\r\ndaughter reveal? The unlikeness of life to the authorised pictures of\r\nlife; the force of evil, only conquerable by the slow-revolving process\r\nof nature which admits not the eternal duration of the perverse; the\r\ngrim and fearful lessons of heredity; the sufficiency of the finite to\r\nthe finite, of life to life, with no other reward than the conduct of\r\nlife fulfils to him that lives; the all-penetrating kinship of living\r\nthings, heather-sprig, singing lark, confident child, relentless tyrant;\r\nand, not least, not least to her already in its shadow, the sure and\r\nuniversal peace of death.\r\n\r\nA strange evangel from such a preacher; but a faith evermore emphasised\r\nand deeper rooted in Emily's mind by her incapacity to acquiesce in the\r\nstiff, pragmatic teaching, the narrow prejudice, of the Calvinists of\r\nHaworth. Yet this very Calvinism influenced her ideas, this doctrine she\r\nso passionately rejected, calling herself a disciple of the tolerant and\r\nthoughtful Frederick Maurice, and writing, in defiance of its flames and\r\nshriekings, the most soothing consolations to mortality that I remember\r\nin our tongue.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, so dual-natured is the force of environment, this\r\nantagonistic faith, repelling her to the extreme rebound of belief, did\r\nnot send her out from it before she had assimilated some of its sternest\r\ntenets. From this doctrine of reward and punishment she learned that for\r\nevery unchecked evil tendency there is a fearful expiation; though she\r\nplaced it not indeed in the flames of hell, but in the perverted\r\ninstincts of our own children. Terrible theories of doomed incurable sin\r\nand predestined loss warned her that an evil stock will only beget\r\ncontamination: the children of the mad must be liable to madness; the\r\nchildren of the depraved, bent towards depravity; the seed of the\r\npoison-plant springs up to blast and ruin, only to be overcome by\r\nuprooting and sterilisation, or by the judicious grafting, the patient\r\ntraining of many years.\r\n\r\nThus prejudiced and evangelical Haworth had prepared the woman who\r\nrejected its Hebraic dogma, to find out for herself the underlying\r\ntruths. She accepted them in their full significance. It has been laid\r\nas a blame to her that she nowhere shows any proper abhorrence of the\r\nfiendish and vindictive Heathcliff. She who reveals him remembers the\r\ndubious parentage of that forsaken seaport baby, \"Lascar or Gipsy;\" she\r\nremembers the Ishmaelitish childhood, too much loved and hated, of the\r\nlittle interloper whose hand was against every man's hand. Remembering\r\nthis, she submits as patiently to his swarthy soul and savage instincts\r\nas to his swarthy skin and \"gibberish that nobody could understand.\"\r\nFrom thistles you gather no grapes.\r\n\r\nNo use, she seems to be saying, in waiting for the children of evil\r\nparents to grow, of their own will and unassisted, straight and noble.\r\nThe very quality of their will is as inherited as their eyes and hair.\r\nHeathcliff is no fiend or goblin; the untrained doomed child of some\r\nhalf-savage sailor's holiday, violent and treacherous. And how far shall\r\nwe hold the sinner responsible for a nature which is itself the\r\npunishment of some forefather's crime. Even for such there must be rest.\r\nNo possibility in the just and reverent mind of Emily Bronte that the\r\nGod whom she believed to be the very fount and soul of life could\r\ncondemn to everlasting fire the victims of morbid tendencies not chosen\r\nby themselves. No purgatory, and no everlasting flame, is needed to\r\npurify the sins of Heathcliff; his grave on the hillside will grow as\r\ngreen as any other spot of grass, moor-sheep will find the grass as\r\nsweet, heath and harebells will grow of the same colour on it as over a\r\nbaby's grave. For life and sin and punishment end with death to the\r\ndying man; he slips his burden then on to other shoulders, and no\r\nvisions mar his rest.\r\n\r\n\"I wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the\r\nsleepers in that quiet earth.\" So ends the last page of 'Wuthering\r\nHeights.'\r\n\r\nSo much for the theories of life and evil that the clash of circumstance\r\nand character struck out from Emily Bronte. It happened, as we know,\r\nthat she had occasion to test these theories; and but for that she could\r\nnever have written 'Wuthering Heights.' Not that the story, the\r\nconception, would have failed. After all there is nothing more appalling\r\nin the violent history of that upland farm than many a midland manor set\r\nthick in elms, many a wild country-house of Wales or Cornwall could\r\nunfold. Stories more socially painful than the mere brute violence of\r\nthe Earnshaws; of madness and treachery, stories of girls entrapped\r\nunwillingly into a lunatic marriage that the estate might have an heir;\r\nlegends of fearful violence, of outcast children, dishonoured wives,\r\nhorrible and persistent evil. Who, in the secret places of his memory,\r\nstores not up such haunting gossip? And Emily, familiar with all the\r\nwild stories of Haworth for a century back, and nursed on grisly Irish\r\nhorrors, tales of 1798, tales of oppression and misery, Emily, with all\r\nthis eerie lore at her finger-ends, would have the less difficulty in\r\ncombining and working the separate motives into a consistent whole, that\r\nshe did not know the real people whose histories she knew by heart. No\r\nmemory of individual manner, dominance or preference for an individual\r\ntype, caught and disarranged her theories, her conception being the\r\ncompleter from her ignorance. This much her strong reason and her\r\ncreative power enabled her to effect. But this is not all.\r\n\r\nThis is the plot; but to make a character speak, act, rave, love, live,\r\ndie, through a whole lifetime of events, even as the readers feel\r\nconvinced he must have acted, must have lived and died, this demands at\r\nleast so much experience of a somewhat similar nature as may serve for a\r\nbase to one's imagination, a reserve of certainty and reassurance on\r\nwhich to draw in times of perplexity and doubt. Branwell, who sat to\r\nAnne sorrily enough for the portrait of Henry Huntingdon, served his\r\nsister Emily, not indeed as a model, a thing to copy, but as a chart of\r\nproportions by which to measure, and to which to refer, for correct\r\ninvestiture, the inspired idea. Mr. Wemyss Reid (whose great knowledge\r\nof the Bronte history and still greater kindness in admitting me to his\r\nadvantages as much as might be, I cannot sufficiently acknowledge)--this\r\ncapable critic perceives a _bona fide_ resemblance between the character\r\nof Heathcliff and the character of Branwell Bronte as he appeared to his\r\nsister Emily. So much, bearing in mind the verse concerning the leveret,\r\nI own I cannot see. Branwell seems to me more nearly akin to\r\nHeathcliff's miserable son than to Heathcliff. But that, in depicting\r\nHeathcliff's outrageous thwarted love for Catharine, Emily did draw upon\r\nher experience of her brother's suffering, this extract from an\r\nunpublished lecture of Mr. Reid's will sufficiently reveal[27]:--\r\n\r\n     \"It was in the enforced companionship of this lost and\r\n     degraded man that Emily received, I am sure, many of the\r\n     impressions which were subsequently conveyed to the pages\r\n     of her book. Has it not been said over and over again by\r\n     critics of every kind that 'Wuthering Heights' reads like\r\n     the dream of an opium-eater? And here we find that during\r\n     the whole time of the writing of the book an habitual and\r\n     avowed opium-eater was at Emily's elbow. I said that perhaps\r\n     the most striking part of 'Wuthering Heights' was that which\r\n     deals with the relations of Heathcliff and Catharine after\r\n     she had become the wife of another. Whole pages of the story\r\n     are filled with the ravings and ragings of the villain\r\n     against the man whose life stands between him and the woman\r\n     he loves. Similar ravings are to be found in all the letters\r\n     of Branwell Bronte written at this period of his career; and\r\n     we may be sure that similar ravings were always on his lips\r\n     as, moody and more than half mad, he wandered about the\r\n     rooms of the parsonage at Haworth. Nay, I have found some\r\n     striking verbal coincidences between Branwell's own language\r\n     and passages in 'Wuthering Heights.' In one of his own\r\n     letters there are these words in reference to the object of\r\n     his passion: 'My own life without her will be hell. What can\r\n     the so-called love of her wretched sickly husband be to her\r\n     compared with mine?' Now, turn to 'Wuthering Heights' and\r\n     you will read these words: 'Two words would comprehend my\r\n     future--death and hell; existence after losing her would be\r\n     hell. Yet I was a fool to fancy for a moment that she valued\r\n     Edgar Linton's attachment more than mine. If he loved with\r\n     all the powers of his puny being, he couldn't love in eighty\r\n     years as much as I could in a day.'\"\r\n\r\nSo much share in 'Wuthering Heights' Branwell certainly had. He was a\r\npage of the book in which his sister studied; he served, as to an\r\nartist's temperament all things unconsciously serve, for the rough block\r\nof granite out of which the work is hewn, and, even while with\r\ndifficulty enduring his vices, Emily undoubtedly learned from them those\r\ndarker secrets of humanity necessary to her tragic incantation. They\r\nserved her, those dreaded, passionate outbreaks of her brother's, even\r\nas the moors she loved, the fancy she courted, served her. Strange\r\ndivining wand of genius, that conjures gold out of the miriest earth of\r\ncommon life; strange and terrible faculty laying up its stores and\r\nhalf-mechanically drawing its own profit out of our slightest or most\r\nmiserable experiences, noting the gesture with which the mother hears of\r\nher son's ruin, catching the faint varying shadow that the white\r\nwind-shaken window-blind sends over the dead face by which we watch,\r\ndrawing its life from a thousand deaths, humiliations, losses, with a\r\nhand in our sharpest joys and bitterest sorrows; this faculty was Emily\r\nBronte's, and drew its profit from her brother's shame.\r\n\r\nHere ended Branwell's share in producing 'Wuthering Heights.' But it is\r\nnot well to ignore his claim to its entire authorship; for in the\r\ncontemptuous silence of those who know their falsity, such slanders live\r\nand thrive like unclean insects under fallen stones. The vain boast of\r\nan unprincipled dreamer, half-mad with opium, half-drunk with gin,\r\nmeaning nothing but the desire to be admired at any cost, has been given\r\ntoo much prominence by those lovers of sensation who prefer any\r\nstartling lie to an old truth. Their ranks have been increased by the\r\nnumber of those who, ignorant of the true circumstances of Emily's life,\r\nfound it impossible that an inexperienced girl could portray so much\r\nviolence and such morbid passion. On the contrary, given these\r\ncircumstances, none but a personally inexperienced girl could have\r\ntreated the subject with the absolute and sexless purity which we find\r\nin 'Wuthering Heights.' How _infecte_, commonplace, and ignominious\r\nwould Branwell, relying on his own recollections, have made the thwarted\r\npassion of a violent adventurer for a woman whose sickly husband both\r\ndespise! That purity as of polished steel, as cold and harder than ice,\r\nthat freedom in dealing with love and hate, as audacious as an infant's\r\nlove for the bright flame of fire, could only belong to one whose\r\nintensity of genius was rivalled by the narrowness of her experience--an\r\nexperience limited not only by circumstances, but by a nature impervious\r\nto any fierier sentiment than the natural love of home and her own\r\npeople, beginning before remembrance and as unconscious as breathing.\r\n\r\nThe critic, having Emily's poems and the few remaining verses and\r\nletters of Branwell, cannot doubt the incapacity of that unnerved and\r\ngarrulous prodigal to produce a work of art so sustained, passionate,\r\nand remote. For in no respect does the terse, fiery, imaginative style\r\nof Emily resemble the weak, disconnected, now vulgar, now pretty\r\nmannerisms of Branwell. There is, indeed, scant evidence that the writer\r\nof Emily's poems could produce 'Wuthering Heights;' but there is, at any\r\nrate, the impossibility that her work could be void of fire,\r\nconcentration, and wild fancy. As great an impossibility as that\r\nvulgarity and tawdriness should not obtrude their ugly heads here and\r\nthere from under Branwell's finest phrases. And since there is no single\r\nvulgar, trite, or Micawber-like effusion throughout 'Wuthering Heights;'\r\nand since Heathcliff's passion is never once treated in the despicable\r\nwould-be worldly fashion in which Branwell describes his own sensations,\r\nand since at the time that 'Wuthering Heights' was written he was\r\nmanifestly, and by his own confession, too physically prostrate for any\r\nliterary effort, we may conclude that Branwell did not write the book.\r\n\r\nOn the other side we have not only the literary evidence of the similar\r\nqualities in 'Wuthering Heights' and in the poems of Ellis Bell, but the\r\nexpress and reiterated assurance of Charlotte Bronte, who never even\r\ndreamed, it would seem, that it could be supposed her brother wrote the\r\nbook; the testimony of the publishers who made their treaty with Ellis\r\nBell; of the servant Martha who saw her mistress writing it; and--most\r\nconvincing of all to those who have appreciated the character of Emily\r\nBronte--the impossibility that a spirit so upright and so careless of\r\nfame should commit a miserable fraud to obtain it.\r\n\r\nIndeed, so baseless is this despicable rumour that to attack it seems\r\nabsurd, only sometimes it is wise to risk an absurdity. Puny insects,\r\nleft too long unhurt, may turn out dangerous enemies irretrievably\r\ndamaging the fertile vine on which they fastened in the security of\r\ntheir minuteness.\r\n\r\nTo the three favouring circumstances of Emily's masterpiece, which we\r\nhave already mentioned--the neighbourhood of her home, the character of\r\nher disposition, the quality of her experience--a fourth must be added,\r\ninferior in degree, and yet not absolutely unimportant. This is her\r\nacquaintance with German literature, and especially with Hoffmann's\r\ntales. In Emily Bronte's day, Romance and Germany had one significance;\r\nit is true that in London and in prose the German influence was dying\r\nout, but in distant Haworth, and in the writings of such poets as Emily\r\nwould read, in Scott, in Southey, most of all in Coleridge, with whose\r\npoems her own have so distinct an affinity, it is still predominant. Of\r\nthe materialistic influence of Italy, of atheist Shelley, Byron with\r\nhis audacity and realism, sensuous Keats, she would have little\r\nexperience in her remote parsonage. And, had she known them, they would\r\nprobably have made no impression on a nature only susceptible to kindred\r\ninfluences. Thackeray, her sister's hero, might have never lived for all\r\nthe trace of him we find in Emily's writings; never is there any single\r\nallusion in her work to the most eventful period of her life, that sight\r\nof the lusher fields and taller elms of middle England; that glimpse of\r\nhurrying vast London; that night on the river, the sun slipping behind\r\nthe masts, doubly large through the mist and smoke in which the houses,\r\nbridges, ships are all spectral and dim. No hint of this, nor of the\r\nsea, nor of Belgium, with its quaint foreign life; nor yet of that\r\nFrench style and method so carefully impressed upon her by Monsieur\r\nHeger, and which so decidedly moulded her elder sister's art. But in the\r\nmidst of her business at Haworth we catch a glimpse of her reading her\r\nGerman book at night, as she sits on the hearthrug with her arm round\r\nKeeper's neck; glancing at it in the kitchen, where she is making bread,\r\nwith the volume of her choice propped up before her; and by the style of\r\nthe novel jotted down in the rough, almost simultaneously with her\r\nreading, we know that to her the study of German was not--like French\r\nand music--the mere necessary acquirement of a governess, but an\r\ninfluence that entered her mind and helped to shape the fashion of her\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nSo much preface is necessary to explain, not the genius of Emily Bronte,\r\nbut the conditions of that genius--there is no use saying more. The aim\r\nof my writing has been missed if the circumstances of her career are not\r\npresent in the mind of my reader. It is too late at this point to do\r\nmore than enumerate them, and briefly point to their significance. Such\r\ncriticism, in face of the living work, is all too much like glancing in\r\na green and beautiful country at a map, from which one may, indeed,\r\nascertain the roads that lead to it and away, and the size of the place\r\nin relation to surrounding districts, but which can give no recognisable\r\nlikeness of the scene which lies all round us, with its fresh life\r\nforgotten and its beauty disregarded. Therefore let us make an end of\r\ntheory and turn to the book on which our heroine's fame is stationed,\r\nfronting eternity. It may be that in unravelling its story and noticing\r\nthe manner in which its facts of character and circumstance impressed\r\nher mind, we may, for a moment, be admitted to a more thorough and\r\nclearer insight into its working than we could earn by the completest\r\nstudy of external evidence, the most earnest and sympathising\r\ncriticism.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: 'Memoir.' Charlotte Bronte.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: 'Emily Bronte.' T. Wemyss Reid.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n'WUTHERING HEIGHTS:' THE STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the summit of Haworth Hill, beyond the street, stands a grey stone\r\nhouse, which is shown as the original of 'Wuthering Heights.' A few\r\nscant and wind-baffled ash-trees grow in front, the moors rise at the\r\nback stretching away for miles. It is a house of some pretensions, once\r\nthe parsonage of Grimshaw, that powerful Wesleyan preacher who, whip in\r\nhand, used to visit the \"Black Bull\" on Sunday morning and lash the\r\nmerrymakers into chapel to listen to his sermon. Somewhat fallen from\r\nits former pretensions, it is a farmhouse now, with much such an\r\noak-lined and stone-floored house-place as is described in 'Wuthering\r\nHeights.' Over the door there is, moreover, a piece of carving: H. E.\r\n1659, a close enough resemblance to \"Hareton Earnshaw, 1500\"--but the\r\n\"wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys\" are nowhere\r\nto be found. Neither do we notice \"the excessive slant of a few stunted\r\nfirs at the end of the house and a range of gaunt thorns all stretching\r\ntheir limbs one way as if craving alms of the sun,\" and, to my thinking,\r\nthis fine old farm of Sowdens is far too near the mills of Haworth to\r\nrepresent the God-forsaken, lonely house of Emily's fancy. Having seen\r\nthe place, as in duty bound, one returns more than ever impressed by the\r\nfact that while every individual and every site in Charlotte's novels\r\ncan be clearly identified, Emily's imagination and her power of drawing\r\nconclusions are alone responsible for the character of her creations.\r\nThis is not saying that she had no data to go upon. Had she not seen\r\nSowdens, and many more such houses, she would never have invented\r\n'Wuthering Heights;' the story and passion of Branwell set on her fancy\r\nto imagine the somewhat similar story and passion of Heathcliff. But in\r\nthe process of her work, the nature of her creations completely\r\novermastered the facts and memories which had induced her to begin.\r\nThese were but the handful of dust which she took to make her man; and\r\nthe qualities and defects of her masterpiece are both largely accounted\r\nfor when we remember that her creation of character was quite unmodified\r\nby any attempt at portraiture.\r\n\r\nTherefore in 'Wuthering Heights' it is with a story, a fancy picture,\r\nthat we have to deal; in drawing and proportion not unnatural, but\r\ncertainly not painted after nature. To quote her sister's beautiful\r\ncomments--\r\n\r\n\"'Wuthering Heights' was hewn in a wild workshop, with simple tools, out\r\nof homely materials. The statuary found a granite block on a solitary\r\nmoor; gazing thereon he saw how from the crag might be elicited a head,\r\nsavage, swart, sinister; a form moulded with at least one element of\r\ngrandeur--power. He wrought with a rude chisel, and from no model but\r\nthe vision of his meditations. With time and labour the crag took human\r\nshape; and there it stands colossal, dark and frowning, half-statue,\r\nhalf-rock; in the former sense, terrible and goblin-like; in the latter,\r\nalmost beautiful, for its colouring is of mellow grey, and moorland moss\r\nclothes it; and heath, with its blooming bells and balmy fragrance,\r\ngrows faithfully close to the giant's foot.\"\r\n\r\nOf the rude chisel we find plentiful traces in the first few chapters of\r\nthe book. The management of the narrative is singularly clumsy,\r\nintroduced by a Mr. Lockwood--a stranger to the North, an imaginary\r\nmisanthropist, who has taken a grange on the moor to be out of the way\r\nof the world--and afterwards continued to him by his housekeeper to\r\namuse the long leisures of a winter illness. But, passing over this\r\ninitial awkwardness of conception, we find a manner equal to the matter\r\nand somewhat resent Charlotte's eloquent comparison; for there are\r\ntouches, fine and delicate, that only a practised hand may dare to give,\r\nand there is feeling in the book, not only \"terrible and goblin-like,\"\r\nbut patient and constant, sprightly and tender, consuming and\r\npassionate. We find, getting over the inexperienced beginning, that the\r\nstyle of the work is noble and accomplished, and that--far from being a\r\nhalf-hewn and casual fancy, a head surmounting a trunk of stone--its\r\nplan is thought out with scientific exactness, no line blurred, no clue\r\nforgotten, the work of an intense and poetic temperament whose vision is\r\ntoo vivid to be incongruous.\r\n\r\nThe first four chapters of 'Wuthering Heights' are merely introductory.\r\nThey relate Mr. Lockwood's visit there, his surprise at the rudeness of\r\nthe place in contrast with the foreign air and look of breeding that\r\ndistinguished Mr. Heathcliff and his beautiful daughter-in-law. He also\r\nnoticed the profound moroseness and ill-temper of everybody in the\r\nhouse. Overtaken by a snowstorm, he was, however, constrained to sleep\r\nthere and was conducted by the housekeeper to an old chamber, long\r\nunused, where (since at first he could not sleep) he amused himself by\r\nlooking over a few mildewed books piled on one corner of the\r\nwindow-ledge. They and the ledge were scrawled all over with writing,\r\n_Catharine Earnshaw_, sometimes varied to _Catharine Heathcliff_, and\r\nagain to _Catharine Linton_. Nothing save these three names was written\r\non the ledge, but the books were covered in every fly-leaf and margin\r\nwith a pen-and-ink commentary, a sort of diary, as it proved, scrawled\r\nin a childish hand. Mr. Lockwood spent the first portion of the night in\r\ndeciphering this faded record; a string of childish mishaps and\r\ndeficiencies dated a quarter of a century ago. Evidently this Catharine\r\nEarnshaw must have been one of Heathcliff's kin, for he figured in the\r\nnarrative as her fellow-scapegrace, and the favourite scapegoat of her\r\nelder brother's wrath. After some time Mr. Lockwood fell asleep, to be\r\ntroubled by harassing dreams, in one of which he fancied that this\r\nchildish Catharine Earnshaw, or rather her spirit, was knocking and\r\nscratching at the fir-scraped window-pane, begging to be let in.\r\nOvercome with the intense horror of nightmare, he screamed aloud in his\r\nsleep. Waking suddenly up he found to his confusion that his yell had\r\nbeen heard, for Heathcliff appeared, exceedingly angry that any one had\r\nbeen allowed to sleep in the oak-closeted room.\r\n\r\n\"If the little fiend had got in at the window she probably would have\r\nstrangled me,\" I returned... \"Catharine Linton or Earnshaw, or however\r\nshe was called--she must have been a changeling, wicked little soul! She\r\ntold me she had been walking the earth these twenty years; a just\r\npunishment for her mortal transgressions, I've no doubt.\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely were these words uttered when I recollected the association of\r\nHeathcliff's with Catharine's name in the books.... I blushed at my\r\ninconsideration--but, without showing further consciousness of the\r\noffence, I hastened to add, 'The truth is, sir, I passed the first part\r\nof the night in--.' Here I stopped afresh--I was about to say 'perusing\r\nthose old volumes,' then it would have revealed my knowledge of their\r\nwritten as well as their printed contents; so I went on, 'in spelling\r\nover the name scratched on that window-ledge: a monotonous occupation\r\ncalculated to set me asleep, like counting, or--.' 'What _can_ you mean\r\nby talking in this way to _me_!' thundered Heathcliff with savage\r\nvehemence. 'How--how _dare_ you, under my roof? God! he's mad to speak\r\nso!' And he struck his forehead with rage.\r\n\r\n\"I did not know whether to resent this language or pursue my\r\nexplanation; but he seemed so powerfully affected that I took pity and\r\nproceeded with my dreams.... Heathcliff gradually fell back into the\r\nshelter of the bed, as I spoke; finally sitting down almost concealed\r\nbehind it. I guessed, however, by his irregular and intercepted\r\nbreathing, that he struggled to vanquish an excess of violent emotion.\r\nNot liking to show him that I had heard the conflict, I continued my\r\ntoilette rather noisily ... and soliloquised on the length of the night.\r\n'Not three o'clock yet! I could have taken oath it had been six. Time\r\nstagnates here: we must surely have retired to rest at eight!'\r\n\r\n\"'Always at nine in winter, and rise at four,' said my host, suppressing\r\na groan; and, as I fancied, by the motion of his arm's shadow, dashing a\r\ntear from his eyes. 'Mr. Lockwood,' he added, 'you may go into my room:\r\nyou'll only be in the way, coming downstairs so early.... Take the\r\ncandle and go where you please. I shall join you directly. Keep out of\r\nthe yard, though, the dogs are unchained; and the house--Juno mounts\r\nsentinel there, and--nay, you can only ramble about the steps and\r\npassages. But, away with you! I'll come in two minutes.'\r\n\r\n\"I obeyed, so far as to quit the chamber; when, ignorant where the\r\nnarrow lobbies led, I stood still, and was witness, involuntarily, to a\r\npiece of superstition on the part of my landlord which belied oddly his\r\napparent sense. He got on to the bed, and wrenched open the lattice,\r\nbursting, as he pulled at it, into an uncontrollable passion of tears.\r\n'Come in! come in!' he sobbed, 'Cathy, do come! Oh, my heart's darling!\r\nhear me _this_ time, Catharine, at last!' The spectre showed a spectre's\r\nordinary caprice: it gave no sign of being; but the snow and wind\r\nwhirled wildly through, even reaching my station, and blowing out the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\"There was such anguish in the gush of grief that accompanied this\r\nraving, that my compassion made me overlook its folly, and I drew off,\r\nhalf angry to have listened at all, and vexed at having related my\r\nridiculous nightmare, since it produced that agony; though _why_ was\r\nbeyond my comprehension.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lockwood got no clue to the mystery at 'Wuthering Heights'; and\r\nlater on returned to Thrushcross Grange, to fall ill of a lingering\r\nfever. During his recovery he heard the history of his landlord, from\r\nhis housekeeper, who had been formerly an occupant of 'Wuthering\r\nHeights,' and after that, for many years, the chief retainer at\r\nThrushcross Grange, where young Mrs. Heathcliff used to live when she\r\nstill was Catharine Linton.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know anything of Mr. Heathcliff's story?\" said Mr. Lockwood to\r\nhis housekeeper, Nelly Dean.\r\n\r\n\"It's a cuckoo's, sir,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nIt is at this point that the history of 'Wuthering Heights' commences,\r\nthat violent and bitter history of the \"little dark thing harboured by a\r\ngood man to his bane,\" carried over the threshold, as Christabel lifted\r\nGeraldine, out of pity for the weakness which, having grown strong,\r\nshall crush the hand that helped it; carried over the threshold, as evil\r\nspirits are carried, powerless to enter of themselves, and yet no evil\r\ndemon, only a human soul lost and blackened by tyranny, injustice and\r\ncongenital ruin. The story of 'Wuthering Heights,' is the story of\r\nHeathcliff. It begins with the sudden journey of the old squire, Mr.\r\nEarnshaw, to Liverpool one summer morning at the beginning of harvest.\r\nHe had asked the children each to choose a present, \"only let it be\r\nlittle, for I shall walk there and back, sixty miles each way:\" and the\r\nson Hindley, a proud, high-spirited lad of fourteen, had chosen a\r\nfiddle; six-year-old Cathy, a whip, for she could ride any horse in the\r\nstable; and Nelly Dean, their humble playfellow and runner of errands,\r\nhad been promised a pocketful of apples and pears. It was the third\r\nnight since Mr. Earnshaw's departure, and the children, sleepy and\r\ntired, had begged their mother to let them sit up a little longer--yet a\r\nlittle longer--to welcome their father, and see their new presents. At\r\nlast--just about eleven o'clock--Mr. Earnshaw came back, laughing and\r\ngroaning over his fatigue; and opening his greatcoat, which he held\r\nbundled up in his arms, he cried:\r\n\r\n\"'See here, wife! I was never so beaten with anything in my life: but\r\nyou must e'en take it as a gift of God; though it's as dark almost as if\r\nit came from the devil.'\r\n\r\n\"We crowded round, and over Miss Cathy's head I had a peep at a dirty,\r\nragged, black-haired child; big enough both to walk and talk; indeed,\r\nits face looked older than Catharine's; yet, when it was set on its\r\nfeet, it only stared round and repeated over and over again some\r\ngibberish that nobody could understand. I was frightened, and Mrs.\r\nEarnshaw was ready to fling it out of doors: she did fly up, asking how\r\nhe could fashion to bring that gipsy brat into the house when they had\r\ntheir own bairns to feed and fend for? What he meant to do with it, and\r\nwhether he were mad? The master tried to explain the matter; but he was\r\nreally half dead with fatigue, and all that I could make out, amongst\r\nher scolding, was a tale of his seeing it starving and houseless, and as\r\ngood as dumb, in the streets of Liverpool, where he picked it up and\r\ninquired for its owner. Not a soul knew to whom it belonged, he said;\r\nand his money and time being both limited, he thought it better to take\r\nit home with him at once, than run into vain expenses there; because he\r\nwas determined he would not leave it as he found it.\"\r\n\r\nSo the child entered 'Wuthering Heights,' a cause of dissension from the\r\nfirst. Mrs. Earnshaw grumbled herself calm; the children went to bed\r\ncrying, for the fiddle had been broken and the whip lost in carrying the\r\nlittle stranger for so many miles. But Mr. Earnshaw was determined to\r\nhave his _protege_ respected; he cuffed saucy little Cathy for making\r\nfaces at the new comer, and turned Nelly Dean out of the house for\r\nhaving set him to sleep on the stairs because the children would not\r\nhave him in their bed. And when she ventured to return some days\r\nafterwards, she found the child adopted into the family, and called by\r\nthe name of a son who had died in childhood--Heathcliff.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he had no enviable position. Cathy, indeed, was very thick\r\nwith him, and the master had taken to him strangely, believing every\r\nword he said, \"for that matter he said precious little, and generally\r\nthe truth,\" but Mrs. Earnshaw disliked the little interloper and never\r\ninterfered in his behalf when Hindley, who hated him, thrashed and\r\nstruck the sullen, patient child, who never complained, but bore all\r\nhis bruises in silence. This endurance made old Earnshaw furious when he\r\ndiscovered the persecutions to which this mere baby was subjected; the\r\nchild soon discovered it to be a most efficient instrument of vengeance.\r\n\r\n\"I remember Mr. Earnshaw once bought a couple of colts at the parish\r\nfair, and gave the lads each one. Heathcliff took the handsomest, but it\r\nsoon fell lame, and when he discovered it, he said to Hindley: 'You must\r\nexchange horses with me, I don't like mine; and if you don't I shall\r\ntell your father of the three thrashings you've given me this week, and\r\nshow him my arm which is black to the shoulder.' Hindley put out his\r\ntongue, and cuffed him over the ears. 'You'd better do it at once,' he\r\npersisted, escaping to the porch (they were in the stable). 'You'll have\r\nto; and if I speak of these blows you'll get them back with interest.'\r\n'Off, dog!' cried Hindley, threatening him with an iron weight, used for\r\nweighing potatoes and hay. 'Throw it,' he replied, standing still, 'and\r\nthen I'll tell how you boasted you would turn me out of doors as soon as\r\nhe died, and see whether he will not turn you out directly. Hindley\r\nthrew it, hitting him on the breast, and down he fell, but staggered up\r\nimmediately, breathless and white; and had not I prevented it, he would\r\nhave gone just so to the master and got full revenge by letting his\r\ncondition plead for him, intimating who had caused it. 'Take my colt,\r\ngipsy, then,' said young Earnshaw. 'And I pray that he may break your\r\nneck; take him and be damned, you beggarly interloper! and wheedle my\r\nfather out of all he has: only afterwards show him what you are, imp of\r\nSatan. And take that; I hope he'll kick out your brains!'\r\n\r\n\"Heathcliff had gone to loose the beast and shift it to his own stall;\r\nhe was passing behind it when Hindley finished his speech by knocking\r\nhim under its feet, and, without stopping to examine whether his hopes\r\nwere fulfilled, ran away as fast as he could. I was surprised to witness\r\nhow coolly the child gathered himself up and went on with his intention;\r\nexchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to\r\novercome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned, before he entered\r\nthe house. I persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises\r\non the horse: he heeded little what tale was told so that he had what he\r\nwanted. He complained so seldom, indeed, of such things as these that I\r\nreally thought him not vindictive; I was deceived completely, as you\r\nwill hear.\"\r\n\r\nSo the division grew. This malignant, uncomplaining child, with foreign\r\nskin and Eastern soul, could only breed discord in that Yorkshire home.\r\nHe could not understand what was honourable by instinct to an English\r\nmind. He was quick to take an advantage, long-suffering, sly, nursing\r\nhis revenge in silence like a vindictive slave, until at last the moment\r\nof retribution should be his; sufficiently truthful and brave to have\r\ngrown noble in another atmosphere, but with a ready bent to underhand\r\nand brooding vengeance. Insensible, it seemed, to gratitude. Proud with\r\nthe unreasoning pride of an Oriental; cruel, and violently passionate.\r\nOne soft and tender speck there was in this dark and sullen heart; it\r\nwas an exceedingly great and forbearing love for the sweet, saucy,\r\nnaughty Catharine.\r\n\r\nBut this one affection only served to augment the mischief that he\r\nwrought. He who had estranged son from father, husband from wife,\r\nsevered brother from sister as completely; for Hindley hated the swarthy\r\nchild who was Cathy's favourite companion. When Mrs. Earnshaw died, two\r\nyears after Heathcliff's advent, Hindley had learned to regard his\r\nfather as an oppressor rather than a friend, and Heathcliff as an\r\nintolerable usurper. So, from the very beginning, he bred bad feeling in\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time Mr. Earnshaw began to fail. His strength suddenly\r\nleft him, and he grew half childish, irritable, and extremely jealous of\r\nhis authority. He considered any slight to Heathcliff as a slight to his\r\nown discretion; so that, in the master's presence, the child was\r\ndeferred to and courted from respect for that master's weakness, while,\r\nbehind his back, the old wrongs, the old hatred, showed themselves\r\nunquenched. And so the child grew up bitter and distrustful. Matters got\r\na little better for a while, when the untameable Hindley was sent to\r\ncollege; yet still there was disturbance and disquiet, for Mr. Earnshaw\r\ndid not love his daughter Catharine, and his heart was yet further\r\nembittered by the grumbling and discontent of old Joseph the servant;\r\nthe wearisomest \"self-righteous Pharisee that ever ransacked a Bible to\r\ntake the promises to himself and fling the curses to his neighbours.\"\r\nBut Catharine, though slighted for Heathcliff, and nearly always in\r\ntrouble on his account, was much too fond of him to be jealous. \"The\r\ngreatest punishment we could invent for her was to keep her separate\r\nfrom Heathcliff.... Certainly she had ways with her such as I never saw\r\na child take up before; and she put all of us past our patience fifty\r\ntimes and oftener in a day; from the hour she came downstairs till the\r\nhour she went to bed, we hadn't a minute's security that she wouldn't be\r\nin mischief. Her spirits were always at high-watermark, her tongue\r\nalways going--singing, laughing, and plaguing everybody who would not do\r\nthe same. A wild, wicked slip she was; but she had the bonniest eye,\r\nthe sweetest smile, and the lightest foot in the parish. And after all,\r\nI believe, she meant no harm; for, when once she made you cry in good\r\nearnest, it seldom happened that she wouldn't keep your company and\r\noblige you to be quiet that you might comfort her. In play she liked\r\nexceedingly to act the little mistress, using her hands freely and\r\ncommanding her companions.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly this pretty, mischievous sprite was left fatherless; Mr.\r\nEarnshaw died quietly, sitting in his chair by the fireside one October\r\nevening. Mr. Hindley, now a young man of twenty, came home to the\r\nfuneral, to the great astonishment of the household bringing a wife with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nA rush of a lass, spare and bright-eyed, with a changing, hectic colour,\r\nhysterical, and full of fancies, fickle as the winds, now flighty and\r\nfull of praise and laughter, now peevish and languishing. For the rest,\r\nthe very idol of her husband's heart. A word from her, a passing phrase\r\nof dislike for Heathcliff, was enough to revive all young Earnshaw's\r\nformer hatred of the boy. Heathcliff was turned out of their society, no\r\nlonger allowed to share Cathy's lessons, degraded to the position of an\r\nordinary farm-servant. At first Heathcliff did not mind. Cathy taught\r\nhim what she learned, and played or worked with him in the fields. Cathy\r\nran wild with him, and had a share in all his scrapes; they both bade\r\nfair to grow up regular little savages, while Hindley Earnshaw kissed\r\nand fondled his young wife utterly heedless of their fate.\r\n\r\nAn adventure suddenly changed the course of their lives. One Sunday\r\nevening Cathy and Heathcliff ran down to Thrushcross Grange to peep\r\nthrough the windows and see how the little Lintons spent their Sundays.\r\nThey looked in, and saw Isabella at one end of the, to them, splendid\r\ndrawing-room, and Edgar at the other, both in floods of tears, peevishly\r\nquarrelling. So elate were the two little savages from Wuthering Heights\r\nat this proof of their neighbours' inferiority, that they burst into\r\npeals of laughter. The little Lintons were terrified, and, to frighten\r\nthem still more, Cathy and Heathcliff made a variety of frightful\r\nnoises; they succeeded in terrifying not only the children but their\r\nsilly parents, who imagined the yells to come from a gang of burglars,\r\ndetermined on robbing the house. They let the dogs loose, in this\r\nbelief, and the bulldog seized Cathy's bare little ankle, for she had\r\nlost her shoes in the bog. While Heathcliff was trying to throttle off\r\nthe brute, the man-servant came up, and, taking both the children\r\nprisoner, conveyed them into the lighted hall. There, to the humiliation\r\nand surprise of the Lintons, the lame little vagrant was discovered to\r\nbe Miss Earnshaw, and her fellow-misdemeanant, \"that strange acquisition\r\nmy late neighbour made in his journey to Liverpool--a little Lascar, or\r\nan American or Spanish castaway.\"\r\n\r\nCathy stayed five weeks at Thrushcross Grange, by which time her ankle\r\nwas quite well, and her manners much improved. Young Mrs. Earnshaw had\r\ntried her best, during this visit, to endeavour by a judicious mixture\r\nof fine clothes and flattery to raise the standard of Cathy's\r\nself-respect. She went home, then, a beautiful and finely-dressed young\r\nlady, to find Heathcliff in equal measure deteriorated; the mere\r\nfarm-servant, whose clothes were soiled with three months' service in\r\nmire and dust, with unkempt hair and grimy face and hands.\r\n\r\n\"'Heathcliff, you may come forward,' cried Mr. Hindley, enjoying his\r\ndiscomfiture, and gratified to see what a forbidding young blackguard he\r\nwould be compelled to present himself. 'You may come and wish Miss\r\nCatharine welcome, like the other servants.' Cathy, catching a glimpse\r\nof her friend in his concealment, flew to embrace him, she bestowed\r\nseven or eight kisses on his cheek within the second, and then stopped,\r\nand, drawing back, burst into a laugh, exclaiming: 'Why, how very black\r\nand cross you look! and how--how funny and grim! But that's because I'm\r\nused to Edgar and Isabella Linton.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, Heathcliff, have you forgotten me? Shake hands, Heathcliff,'\r\nsaid Mr. Earnshaw, condescendingly, 'once in a way, that is permitted.'\r\n\r\n\"'I shall not,' replied the boy, finding his tongue at last. 'I shall\r\nnot stand to be laughed at. I shall not bear it.'\"\r\n\r\nFrom this time Catharine's friendship with Heathcliff was chequered by\r\nintermittent jealousy on his side and intermittent disgust upon hers;\r\nand for this evil turn, far more than for any coarser brutality,\r\nHeathcliff longed for revenge on Hindley Earnshaw. Meanwhile Edgar\r\nLinton, greatly smitten with the beautiful Catharine, went from time to\r\ntime to visit at Wuthering Heights. He would have gone far oftener, but\r\nthat he had a terror of Hindley Earnshaw's reputation, and shrank from\r\nencountering him.\r\n\r\nFor this fine young Oxford gentleman, this proud young husband, was\r\nsinking into worse excesses than any of his wild Earnshaw ancestors. A\r\ndefiant sorrow had driven him to desperation. In the summer following\r\nCatharine's visit to Thrushcross Grange, his only son and heir had been\r\nborn. An occasion of great rejoicings, suddenly dashed by the discovery\r\nthat his wife, his idol, was fast sinking in consumption. Hindley\r\nrefused to believe it, and his wife kept her flighty spirits till the\r\nend; but one night, while leaning on his shoulder, a fit of coughing\r\ntook her--a very slight one. She put her two hands about his neck, her\r\nface changed, and she was dead.\r\n\r\nHindley grew desperate, and gave himself over to wild companions, to\r\nexcesses of dissipation, and tyranny. \"His treatment of Heathcliff was\r\nenough to make a fiend of a saint.\" Heathcliff bore it with sullen\r\npatience, as he had borne the blows and kicks of his childhood, turning\r\nthem into a lever for extorting advantages; the aches and wants of his\r\nbody were redeemed by a fierce joy at heart, for in this degradation of\r\nHindley Earnshaw he recognised the instrument of his own revenge.\r\n\r\nTime went on, ever making a sharper difference between this gipsy hind\r\nand his beautiful young mistress; time went on, leaving the two fast\r\nfriends enough, but leaving also in the heart of Heathcliff a passionate\r\nrancour against the man who, of set purpose, had made him unworthy of\r\nCatharine's hand, and of the other man on whom it was to be bestowed.\r\n\r\nFor Edgar Linton was infatuated with the naughty, tricksy young beauty\r\nof Wuthering Heights. Her violent temper did not frighten him, although\r\nhis own character was singularly sweet, placid and feeble; her\r\ncompromising friendship with such a mere boor as young Heathcliff was\r\nonly a trifling annoyance easily to be excused. And when his own father\r\nand mother died of a fever caught in nursing her he did not love her\r\nless for the sorrow she brought. A fever she had wilfully taken in\r\ndespair, and a sudden sickness of life. One evening pretty Cathy came\r\ninto the kitchen to tell Nelly Dean that she had engaged herself to\r\nmarry Edgar Linton. Heathcliff, unseen, was seated on the other side the\r\nsettle, on a bench by the wall, quite hidden from those at the\r\nfireside.\r\n\r\nCathy was very elated, but not at all happy. Edgar was rich, handsome,\r\nyoung, gentle, passionately in love with her; still she was miserable.\r\nNelly Dean, who was nursing the baby Hareton by the fire, finally grew\r\nout of patience with her whimsical discontent.\r\n\r\n\"'Your brother will be pleased,'\" she said; \"'the old lady and gentleman\r\nwill not object, I think; you will escape from a disorderly, comfortless\r\nhome into a wealthy, respectable one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar\r\nloves you. All seems smooth and easy; where is the obstacle?'\r\n\r\n\"'_Here!_ and here!' replied Catharine, striking one hand on her\r\nforehead and the other on her breast. 'In whichever place the soul\r\nlives. In my soul and in my heart I'm convinced I'm wrong.'\r\n\r\n\"'That's very strange. I cannot make it out.'\r\n\r\n\"'It's my secret. But if you will not mock at me, I'll explain it. I\r\ncan't do it distinctly; but I'll give you a feeling of how I feel.'\r\n\r\n\"'She seated herself by me again; her countenance grew sadder and\r\ngraver, and her clasped hands trembled.\r\n\r\n\"'Nelly, do you never dream queer dreams?' she said, suddenly, after\r\nsome minutes' reflection.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, now and then,' I answered.\r\n\r\n\"'And so do I. I've dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me\r\never after, and changed my ideas; they've gone through and through me\r\nlike wine through water, and altered the colour of my mind. And this is\r\none: I'm going to tell it, but take care not to smile at any part of\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, don't, Miss Catharine,' I cried. 'We're dismal enough without\r\nconjuring up ghosts and visions to perplex us....'\r\n\r\n\"She was vexed, but she did not proceed. Apparently taking up another\r\nsubject, she recommenced in a short time.\r\n\r\n\"'If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable.'\r\n\r\n\"'Because you are not fit to go there,' I answered; 'all sinners would\r\nbe miserable in heaven.'\r\n\r\n\"'But it is not that. I dreamt once that I was there.'\r\n\r\n\"'I tell you, I won't hearken to your dreams, Miss Catharine. I'll go to\r\nbed,' I interrupted again.\r\n\r\n\"She laughed, and held me down, for I made a motion to leave my chair.\r\n\r\n\"'This is nothing,' cried she; 'I was only going to say that heaven did\r\nnot seem to be any home; and I broke my heart with weeping to come back\r\nto earth; and the angels were so angry that they flung me out into the\r\nmiddle of the heath on the top of Wuthering Heights, where I woke\r\nsobbing for joy. That will do to explain my secret as well as the other.\r\nI've no more business to marry Edgar Linton than I have to be in heaven;\r\nand, if the wicked man in there hadn't brought Heathcliff so low, I\r\nshouldn't have thought of it. It would degrade me to marry Heathcliff\r\nnow, so he shall never know how I love him; and that, not because he's\r\nhandsome, Nelly, but because he's more myself than I am. Whatever our\r\nsouls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as\r\ndifferent as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire.'\r\n\r\n\"Ere this speech ended I became sensible of Heathcliff's presence.\r\nHaving noticed a slight movement, I turned my head, and saw him rise\r\nfrom the bench and steal out noiselessly. He had listened till he had\r\nheard Catharine say that it would degrade her to marry him, and then he\r\nstayed to hear no further. My companion, sitting on the ground, was\r\nprevented by the back of the settle from remarking his presence or\r\ndeparture; but I started, and bade her hush.\r\n\r\n\"'Why?' she asked, gazing nervously round.\r\n\r\n\"'Joseph is here,' I answered, catching opportunely the roll of his\r\ncart-wheels up the road, 'and Heathcliff will be coming in with him....\r\nUnfortunate creature, as soon as you become Mrs. Linton he loses friend\r\nand love and all. Have you considered how you'll bear the separation,\r\nand how he'll bear to be quite deserted in the world? Because, Miss\r\nCatharine....'\r\n\r\n\"'He quite deserted! we separated!' she exclaimed, with an accent of\r\nindignation. 'Who is to separate us, pray! They'll meet the fate of\r\nMilo. Not as long as I live, Ellen; for no mortal creature. Every Linton\r\non the face of the earth might melt into nothing, before I could consent\r\nto forsake Heathcliff.... My great miseries in this world have been\r\nHeathcliff's miseries, and I watched and felt each from the beginning.\r\nMy great thought in living is himself. If all else perished, and _he_\r\nremained, _I_ should still continue to be; and if all else remained and\r\nhe were annihilated, the universe would turn to a mighty stranger: I\r\nshould not seem a part of it. My love for Linton is like the foliage in\r\nthe woods: time will change it, I'm well aware, as winter changes the\r\ntrees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath; a\r\nsource of little visible delight, but necessary. Nelly, I am Heathcliff.\r\nHe's always, always in my mind: not as a pleasure, any more than I am\r\nalways a pleasure to myself, but as my own being. So don't talk of our\r\nseparation again; it is impracticable; and----'\r\n\r\n\"She paused, and hid her face in the folds of my gown; but I jerked it\r\nforcibly away. I was out of patience with her folly.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Cathy! beautiful, haughty, and capricious; who should guide and\r\ncounsel her? her besotted, drunken brother? the servant who did not love\r\nher and was impatient of her weathercock veerings? No. And Heathcliff,\r\nwho, brutalised and rude as he was, at least did love and understand\r\nher? Heathcliff, who had walked out of the house, her rejection burning\r\nin his ears, not to enter it till he was fitted to exact both love and\r\nvengeance. He did not come back that night, though the thunder rattled\r\nand the rain streamed over Wuthering Heights; though Cathy, shawl-less\r\nin the wind and wet, stood calling him through the violent storms that\r\ndrowned and baffled her cries.\r\n\r\nAll night she would not leave the hearth, but lay on the settle sobbing\r\nand moaning, all soaked as she was, with her hands on her face and her\r\nface to the wall. A strange augury for her marriage, these first dreams\r\nof her affianced love--not dreams, indeed, but delirium; for the next\r\nmorning she was burning and tossing in fever, near to death's door as it\r\nseemed.\r\n\r\nBut she won through, and Edgar's parents carried her home to nurse. As\r\nwe know, they took the infection and died within a few days of each\r\nother. Nor was this the only ravage that the fever made. Catharine,\r\nalways hasty and fitful in temper, was henceforth subject at rare\r\nintervals to violent and furious rages, which threatened her life and\r\nreason by their extremity. The doctor said she ought not to be crossed;\r\nshe ought to have her own way, and it was nothing less than murder in\r\nher eyes for any one to presume to stand up and contradict her. But the\r\nstrained temper, the spoiled, authoritative ways, the saucy caprices of\r\nhis bride, were no blemishes in Edgar Linton's eyes. \"He was infatuated,\r\nand believed himself the happiest man alive on the day he led her to\r\nGimmerton Chapel three years subsequent to his father's death.\"\r\n\r\nDespite so many gloomy auguries the marriage was a happy one at first.\r\nCatharine was petted and humoured by every one, with Edgar for a\r\nperpetual worshipper; his pretty, weak-natured sister Isabella as an\r\nadmiring companion; and for the necessary spectator of her happiness,\r\nNelly Dean, who had been induced to quit her nursling at Wuthering\r\nHeights.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Heathcliff returned, not the old Heathcliff, but a far more\r\ndangerous enemy, a tall, athletic, well-formed man, intelligent, and\r\nsevere. \"A half-civilised ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and\r\neyes, full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his manner was even\r\ndignified, though too stern for grace.\" A formidable rival for boyish\r\nEdgar Linton, with his only son's petulance, constitutional timidity,\r\nand weak health. Cathy, though she was really attached to her husband,\r\ngave him cruel pain by her undisguised and childish delight at\r\nHeathcliff's return; he had a presentiment that evil would come of the\r\nold friendship thus revived, and would willingly have forbidden\r\nHeathcliff the house; but Edgar, so anxious lest any cross be given to\r\nhis wife, with a double reason then for tenderly guarding her health,\r\ncould not inflict a serious sorrow upon her with only a baseless\r\njealousy for its excuse. Thus, Heathcliff became intimate at Thrushcross\r\nGrange, the second house to which he was made welcome, the second hearth\r\nhe meant to ruin. At this time he was lodging at Wuthering Heights. On\r\nhis return he had first intended, he told Catharine, \"just to have one\r\nglimpse of your face, a stare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended\r\npleasure; afterwards settle my score with Hindley; and then prevent the\r\nlaw by doing execution on myself.\"\r\n\r\nCatharine's welcome changed this plan; her brother was safe from\r\nHeathcliff's violence; but not from his hate. The score was being\r\nsettled in a different fashion. Hindley--who was eager to get money for\r\nhis gambling and who had drunk his wits away--was only too glad to take\r\nHeathcliff as lodger, boon-companion, and fellow card-player at once.\r\nAnd Heathcliff was content to wait and take his revenge sip by sip,\r\nencouraging his old oppressor in drink and gaming, watching him lose\r\nacre after acre of his land, knowing that sooner or later Earnshaw would\r\nlose everything, and he, Heathcliff, be master of Wuthering Heights,\r\nwith Hindley's son for his servant. Revenge is sweet. Meanwhile,\r\nWuthering Heights was a handy lodging, at walking distance from the\r\nGrange.\r\n\r\nBut soon his visits were cut off. Isabella Linton--a charming girl of\r\neighteen with an _espiegle_ face and a thin sweetness of disposition\r\nthat could easily turn sour--Isabella Linton fell in love with\r\nHeathcliff. To do him justice he had never dreamed of marrying her,\r\nuntil one day Catharine, in a fit of passion, revealed the poor girl's\r\nsecret. Heathcliff pretended not to believe her, but Isabel was her\r\nbrother's heir, and to marry her, inherit Edgar's money, and ill-use his\r\nsister, would, indeed, be a fair revenge on Catharine's husband.\r\n\r\nAt first it was merely as an artistically pleasurable idea, a castle in\r\nthe air, to be dreamed about, not built, that this scheme suggested\r\nitself to Heathcliff. But one day, when he had been detected in an\r\nexperimental courting of Isabel, Edgar Linton, glad of an excuse, turned\r\nhim out of doors. Then, in a paroxysm of hatred, never-satisfied\r\nrevenge, and baffled passion, Heathcliff struck with the poisoned weapon\r\nready to his hand. He persuaded Isabel to run away with him--no\r\ndifficult task--and they eloped together one night to be married.\r\n\r\nIsabella--poor, weak, romantic, sprightly Isabel--was not missed at\r\nfirst; for very terrible trouble had fallen upon the Grange. Catharine,\r\nin a paroxysm of rage at the dismissal of Heathcliff, quarrelled\r\nviolently with Edgar, and shut herself up in her own room. For three\r\ndays and nights she remained there, eating nothing; Edgar, secluded in\r\nhis study, expecting every moment that she would come down and ask his\r\nforgiveness; Nelly Dean, who alone knew of her determined starving,\r\nresolved to say nothing about it, and conquer, once for all, the haughty\r\nand passionate spirit which possessed her beautiful young mistress.\r\n\r\nSo three days went by. Catharine still refused all her food, and\r\nunsympathetic Ellen still resolved to let her starve, if she chose,\r\nwithout a remonstrance. On the third day Catharine unbarred her door and\r\nasked for food; and now Ellen Dean was too frightened to exult. Her\r\nmistress was wasted, haggard, wild, as if by months of illness; the\r\ntoo-presumptuous servant remembered the doctor's warning, and dreaded\r\nher master's anger, when he should discover Catharine's real condition.\r\n\r\nOn this servant's obstinate cold-heartedness rests the crisis of\r\n'Wuthering Heights;' had Ellen Dean, at the first, attempted to console\r\nthe violent, childish Catharine, had she acquainted Edgar of the real\r\nweakness underneath her pride, Catharine would have had no fatal illness\r\nand left no motherless child; and had moping Isabel, instead of being\r\nleft to weep alone about the park and garden, been conducted to her\r\nsister's room and shown a real sickness to nurse, a real misery to mend,\r\nshe would not have gone away with Heathcliff, and wedded herself to\r\nsorrow, out of a fanciful love in idleness. It is characteristic of\r\nEmily Bronte's genius that she should choose so very simple and homely\r\na means for the production of most terrible results.\r\n\r\nA fit she had had alone and untended during those three days of isolated\r\nstarvation had unsettled Catharine's reason. The gradual coming-on of\r\nher delirium is given with a masterly pathos that Webster need not have\r\nmade more strong, nor Fletcher more lovely and appealing:--\r\n\r\n\"A minute previously she was violent; now, supported on one arm and not\r\nnoticing my refusal to obey her, she seemed to find childish diversion\r\nin pulling the feathers from the rents she had just made in the pillows\r\nand ranging them on the sheet according to their different species: her\r\nmind had strayed to other associations.\r\n\r\n\"'That's a turkey's,' she murmured to herself, 'and this is a wild\r\nduck's, and this is a pigeon's. Ah, they put pigeons' feathers in the\r\npillows--no wonder I couldn't die! Let me take care to throw it on the\r\nfloor when I lie down. And here is a moorcock's; and this--I should know\r\nit among a thousand--it's a lapwing's. Bonny bird; wheeling over our\r\nheads in the middle of the moor. It wanted to get to its nest, for the\r\nclouds had touched the swells, and it felt rain coming. This feather was\r\npicked up from the heath, the bird was not shot: we saw its nest in the\r\nwinter, full of little skeletons. Heathcliff set a trap over it and the\r\nold ones dare not come. I made him promise he'd never shoot a lapwing\r\nafter that, and he didn't. Yes, here are more! Did he shoot my lapwings,\r\nNelly? Are they red, any of them? Let me look.'\r\n\r\n\"'Give over with that baby-work!' I interrupted, dragging the pillow\r\naway, and turning the holes towards the mattress, for she was removing\r\nits contents by handfuls. 'Lie down and shut your eyes: you're\r\nwandering. There's a mess! The down is flying about like snow.'\r\n\r\n\"I went here and there collecting it.\r\n\r\n\"'I see in you, Nelly,' she continued, dreamily, 'an aged woman: you\r\nhave grey hair and bent shoulders. This bed is the fairy cave under\r\nPeniston Crag, and you are gathering elf-bolts to hurt our heifers;\r\npretending while I am near that they are only locks of wool. That's what\r\nyou'll come to fifty years hence: I know you are not so now. I'm not\r\nwandering; you're mistaken, or else I should believe you really _were_\r\nthat withered hag, and I should think I _was_ under Peniston Crag; and\r\nI'm conscious it's night, and there are two candles on the table making\r\nthe black press shine like jet.'\r\n\r\n\"'The black press? Where is that?' I asked. 'You are talking in your\r\nsleep.'\r\n\r\n\"'It's against the wall as it always is,' she replied. 'It _does_ appear\r\nodd. I see a face in it!'\r\n\r\n\"'There's no press in the room and never was,' said I, resuming my seat,\r\nand looping up the curtain that I might watch her.\r\n\r\n\"'Don't _you_ see that face?' she inquired, gazing earnestly at the\r\nmirror.\r\n\r\n\"And say what I could I was incapable of making her comprehend it to be\r\nher own; so I rose and covered it with a shawl.\r\n\r\n\"'It's behind there still!' she pursued, anxiously, 'and it stirred. Who\r\nis it? I hope it will not come out when you are gone. Oh, Nelly! the\r\nroom is haunted! I'm afraid of being alone.'\r\n\r\n\"I took her hand in mine, and bid her be composed, for a succession of\r\nshudders convulsed her frame, and she would keep straining her gaze\r\ntowards the glass.\r\n\r\n\"'There's nobody here!' I insisted. 'It was _yourself_ Mrs. Linton: you\r\nknew it a while since.'\r\n\r\n\"'Myself!' she gasped, 'and the clock is striking twelve. It's true\r\nthen! that's dreadful.'\r\n\r\n\"Her fingers clutched the clothes, and gathered them over her eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThis scene was the beginning of a long and fearful brain-fever, from\r\nwhich, owing to her husband's devoted and ceaseless care, Catharine\r\nrecovered her life, but barely her reason. That hung in the balance, a\r\ntouch might settle it on the side of health or of madness. Not until the\r\nbeginning of this fever was Isabella's flight discovered. Her brother\r\nwas too concerned with his wife's illness to feel as heart-broken as\r\nHeathcliff hoped. He was not violent against his sister, nor even angry;\r\nonly, with the mild steady persistence of his nature, he refused to hold\r\nany communication with Heathcliff's wife. But when, at the beginning of\r\nCatharine's recovery, Ellen Dean received a letter from Isabella,\r\ndeclaring the extreme wretchedness of her life at Wuthering Heights,\r\nwhere Heathcliff was master now, Edgar Linton willingly accorded the\r\nservant permission to go and see his sister.\r\n\r\nArrived at Wuthering Heights, she found that once plentiful homestead\r\nsorely ruined and deteriorated by years of thriftless dissipation; and\r\nIsabella Linton, already metamorphosed into a wan and listless slattern,\r\nbroken-spirited and pale. As a pleasant means of entertaining his wife\r\nand her old servant, Heathcliff discoursed on his love for Catharine and\r\non his conviction that she could not really care for Edgar Linton.\r\n\r\n\"'Catharine has a heart as deep as I have: the sea could be as readily\r\ncontained in that horse-trough, as her whole affection monopolised by\r\nhim. Tush! He is scarcely a degree dearer to her than her dog or her\r\nhorse. It is not in him to be loved like me. How can she love in him\r\nwhat he has not?'\"\r\n\r\nNelly Dean, unhindered by the sight of Isabella's misery, or by the\r\nmemory of the wrongs her master already suffered from this estimable\r\nneighbour, was finally cajoled into taking a letter from him to the\r\nfrail half-dying Catharine, appointing an interview. For Heathcliff\r\npersisted that he had no wish to make a disturbance, or to exasperate\r\nMr. Linton, but merely to see his old playfellow again, to learn from\r\nher own lips how she was, and whether in anything he could serve her.\r\n\r\nThe letter was taken and given; the meeting came about one Sunday when\r\nall the household save Ellen Dean were at church. Catharine, pale,\r\napathetic, but more than ever beautiful in her mazed weakness of mind\r\nand body; Heathcliff, violent in despair, seeing death in her face,\r\nalternately upbraiding her fiercely for causing him so much misery, and\r\ntenderly caressing the altered, dying face. Never was so strange a love\r\nscene. It is not a scene to quote, not noticeable for its eloquent\r\npassages or the beauty of casual phrases, but for its sustained passion,\r\ndesperate, pure, terrible. It must be read in its sequence and its\r\nentirety. Nor can I think of any parting more terrible, more penetrating\r\nin its anguish than this. Romeo and Juliet part; but they have known\r\neach other but for a week. There is no scene that Heathcliff can look\r\nupon in which he has not played with Catharine: and, now that she is\r\ndying, he must not watch with her. Troilus and Cressida part; but\r\nCressida is false, and Troilus has his country left him. What country\r\nhas Heathcliff, the outcast, nameless, adventurer? Antonio and his\r\nDuchess; but they have belonged to each other and been happy; these two\r\nare eternally separate. Their passion is only heightened by its\r\nabsolute freedom from desire; even the wicked and desperate Heathcliff\r\nhas no ignoble love for Catharine; all he asks is that she live, and\r\nthat he may see her; that she may be happy even if it be with Linton. \"I\r\nwould never have banished him from her society, while she desired his,\"\r\nasserts Heathcliff, and now she is mad with grief and dying. The\r\nconsciousness of their strained and thwarted natures, moreover, makes us\r\nthe more regretful they must sever. Had he survived, Romeo would have\r\nbeen happy with Rosalind, after all; probably Juliet would have married\r\nParis. But where will Heathcliff love again, the perverted, morose,\r\nbrutalised Heathcliff, whose only human tenderness has been his love for\r\nthe capricious, lively, beautiful young creature, now dazed, now\r\nwretched, now dying in his arms? The very remembrance of his violence\r\nand cruelty renders more awful the spectacle of this man, sitting with\r\nhis dying love, silent; their faces hid against each other, and washed\r\nby each other's tears.\r\n\r\nAt last they parted: Catharine unconscious, half-dead. That night her\r\npuny, seven-months' child was born; that night the mother died,\r\nunutterably changed from the bright imperious creature who entered that\r\nhouse as a kingdom, not yet a year ago. By her side, in the darkened\r\nchamber, her husband lay, worn out with anguish. Outside, dashing his\r\nhead against the trees in a Berserker-wrath with fate, Heathcliff raged,\r\nnot to be consoled.\r\n\r\n\"'Her senses never returned: she recognised nobody from the time you\r\nleft her,' I said. 'She lies with a sweet smile upon her face, and her\r\nlatest ideas wandered back to pleasant early days. Her life closed in a\r\ngentle dream--may she wake as kindly in the other world!'\r\n\r\n\"'May she wake in torment!' he cried, with frightful vehemence,\r\nstamping his foot and groaning in a paroxysm of ungovernable passion.\r\n'Why, she's a liar to the end! Where is she? Not _there_--not in\r\nheaven--not perished--where? Oh! you said you cared nothing for my\r\nsufferings. And I pray one prayer. I repeat it till my tongue stiffens.\r\nCatharine Earnshaw, may you not rest as long as I am living. You said I\r\nkilled you--haunt me then! The murdered do haunt their murderers, I\r\nbelieve. I know that ghosts _have_ wandered on earth. Be with me\r\nalways--take any form--drive me mad! only _do_ not leave me in this\r\nabyss where I cannot find you! Oh, God, it is unutterable! I _cannot_\r\nlive without my life. I _cannot_ live without my soul.'\r\n\r\n\"He dashed his head against the knotted trunk; and, lifting up his eyes,\r\nhowled, not like a man, but like a savage beast being goaded to death\r\nwith knives and spears. I observed several splashes of blood about the\r\nbark of the tree, and his hand and forehead were both stained; probably\r\nthe scene I witnessed was the repetition of others acted during the\r\nnight. It hardly moved my compassion, it appalled me.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this time a slow insidious madness worked in Heathcliff. When it\r\nwas at its height he was not fierce, but strangely silent, scarcely\r\nbreathing; hushed, as a person who draws his breath to hear some sound\r\nonly just not heard as yet, as a man who strains his eyes to see the\r\nspeck on the horizon which will rise the next moment, the next instant,\r\nand grow into the ship that brings his treasure home. \"When I sat in the\r\nhouse with Hareton, it seemed that on going out I should meet her; when\r\nI walked on the moors, I should meet her coming in. When I went from\r\nhome, I hastened to return; she _must_ be somewhere at the Heights I was\r\ncertain; and when I slept in her chamber--I was beaten out of that. I\r\ncouldn't lie there; for the moment I closed my eyes, she was either\r\noutside the window, or sliding back the panels, or entering the room, or\r\neven resting her darling head on the same pillow, as she did when a\r\nchild; and I must open my lids to see. And so I opened and closed them a\r\nhundred times a night to be always disappointed. It was a strange way of\r\nkilling, not by inches, but by fractions of hairbreadths, to beguile me\r\nwith the spectre of a hope through eighteen years.\" This mania of\r\nexpectation stretching the nerves to their uttermost strain, relaxed\r\nsometimes; and then Heathcliff was dangerous. When filled with the\r\nthought of Catharine, the world was indifferent to him; but when this\r\npossessing memory abated ever so little, he remembered that the world\r\nwas his enemy, had cheated him of Catharine. Then avarice, ambition,\r\nrevenge, entered into his soul, and his last state was worse than his\r\nfirst. Cruel, with the insane cruelty, the bloodmania of an Ezzelin, he\r\nnever was; his cruelties had a purpose, the sufferings of the victims\r\nwere a detail not an end. Yet something of that despot's character,\r\nrefined into torturing the mind and not the flesh, chaste, cruel,\r\navaricious of power, something of that Southern morbidness in crime,\r\ndistinguishes Heathcliff from the villains of modern English tragedies.\r\nPlaced in the Italian Renaissance, with Cyril Tourneur for a chronicler,\r\nHeathcliff would not have awakened the outburst of incredulous\r\nindignation which greeted his appearance in a nineteenth century\r\nromance.\r\n\r\nSoon after the birth of the younger Catharine, Isabella Heathcliff\r\nescaped from her husband to the South of England. He made no attempt to\r\nfollow her, and in her new home she gave birth to a son, Linton--the\r\nfruit of timidity and hatred, fear and revulsion--\"from the first she\r\nreported him to be an ailing, peevish creature.\" Meanwhile little\r\nCatharine grew up the very light of her home, an exquisite creature with\r\nher father's gentle, constant nature inspired by a spark of her mother's\r\nfire and lightened by a gleam of her wayward caprice. She had the\r\nEarnshaws' handsome dark eyes and the Lintons' fair skin, regular\r\nfeatures and curling yellow hair. \"That capacity for intense attachments\r\nreminded me of her mother. Still she did not resemble her; her anger was\r\nnever furious; her love never fierce; it was deep and tender.\" Cathy was\r\nin truth a charming creature, though less passionate and strange a\r\nnature than Catharine Earnshaw, not made to be loved as wildly nor as\r\ndeeply mistrusted.\r\n\r\nEdgar, grown a complete hermit, devoted himself to his child, who spent\r\na life as happy and secluded as a princess in a fairy story, seldom\r\nventuring outside the limits of the park and never by herself. Edgar had\r\nnever forgotten his sorrow for the death of his young wife; he loved her\r\nmemory with steady constancy. If--and I think we may--if we allow that\r\nevery author has some especial quality with which, in more or less\r\ndegree, he endows all his children--if we grant that Shakespeare's\r\npeople are all meditative, even the sprightly Rosalind and the clownish\r\nDogberry--if we allow that all our acquaintances in Dickens are a trifle\r\nself-conscious, in George Eliot conscientious to such an extent that\r\neven Tito Melema feels remorse for conduct which, granted his period and\r\nhis character, would more naturally have given him satisfaction--then we\r\nmust allow that Emily Bronte's special mark is constancy. Passionate,\r\ninsane constancy in Heathcliff; perverse, but intense in the elder\r\nCatharine; steady and holy in Edgar Linton; even the hard and narrow\r\nEllen Dean; even Joseph, the hypocritical Pharisee, are constant until\r\ndeath. Wild Hindley Earnshaw drinks himself to death for grief at losing\r\nhis consumptive wife; Hareton loves to the end the man who has usurped\r\nhis place, degraded him, fed him on blows and exaction: and it is\r\nconstancy in absence that embitters and sickens the younger Catharine.\r\nEven Isabella Heathcliff, weak as she is, is not fickle. Even Linton\r\nHeathcliff, who, of all the characters in fiction, may share with Barnes\r\nNewcome the bad eminence of supreme unlovableness, even he loves his\r\nmother and Catharine, and, in his selfish way, loves them to the end.\r\n\r\nThe years passed, nothing happened, save that Hindley Earnshaw died, and\r\nHeathcliff--to whom every yard had been mortgaged, took possession of\r\nthe place; Hareton, who should have been the first gentleman in the\r\nneighbourhood, \"being reduced to a state of complete dependence on his\r\nfather's inveterate enemy, lives as a servant in his own house, deprived\r\nof the advantages of wages, quite unable to right himself because of his\r\nfriendlessness, and his ignorance that he has been wronged.\"\r\n\r\nThe eventless years went by till Catharine was thirteen, when Mrs.\r\nHeathcliff died, and Edgar went to the South of England to fetch her\r\nson. Little Cathy, during her father's absence, grew impatient of her\r\nconfinement to the park; there was no one to escort her over the moors,\r\nso one day she leapt the fence, got lost, and was finally sheltered at\r\nWuthering Heights, of which place and of all its inmates she had been\r\nkept in total ignorance. She promised to keep the visit a secret from\r\nher father, lest he should dismiss Ellen Dean. She was very indignant at\r\nbeing told that rudely-bred Hareton was her cousin; and when that night\r\nLinton--delicate, pretty, pettish Linton--arrived, she infinitely\r\npreferred his cousinship.\r\n\r\nThe next morning she found Linton gone, his father having sent for him\r\nto Wuthering Heights; Edgar Linton, however, did not tell his daughter\r\nthat her cousin was so near, he would not for worlds she should cross\r\nthe threshold of that terrible house. But one day, Cathy and Ellen Dean\r\nmet Heathcliff on the moors, and he half persuaded, half forced them to\r\ncome home and see his son, grown a most despicable, puling, ailing\r\ncreature, half-violent, half-terrified. Cathy's kind little heart did\r\nnot see the faults, she only saw that her cousin was ill, unhappy, in\r\nneed of her; she was easily entrapped, one winter, when her father and\r\nEllen Dean were both ill, into a secret engagement with this boy-cousin,\r\nthe only lad, save uncouth Hareton, whom she had ever seen.\r\n\r\nEvery night, when her day's nursing was done, she rode over to Wuthering\r\nHeights to pet and fondle Linton. Heathcliff did all he could to favour\r\nthe plan. He knew his son was dying, notwithstanding that every care was\r\ntaken to preserve the heir of Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange.\r\nIt is true that Cathy had a rival claim; to marry her to Linton would be\r\nto secure the title, get a wife for his dying son to preserve the line\r\nof inheritance, and certainly to break Edgar Linton's heart.\r\nHeathcliff's love of revenge and love of power combined to make the\r\nscheme a thing to strive for and desire.\r\n\r\nHe grew desperate as the boy got weaker and weaker; it was but too\r\nlikely that he would die before his dying uncle, and, if Edgar Linton\r\nsurvived, Thrushcross Grange was lost to Heathcliff. As a last resource\r\nhe made his son write to Edgar Linton and beg for an interview on\r\nneutral ground. Edgar, who, ignorant of Linton Heathcliff's true\r\ncharacter, saw no reason why Cathy should not marry her cousin if they\r\nloved each other, allowed Ellen Dean to take her little mistress, now\r\nseventeen years old, on to the moors where Linton Heathcliff was to\r\nmeet them. Cathy was loath to leave her father even for an hour, he was\r\nso ill; but she had been told Linton was dying, so nerved herself to go\r\nonce more on the moors: they found Linton in a strange state, terrified,\r\nexhausted, despondent, making spasmodic love to Cathy as if it were a\r\nlesson he had been beaten into learning. She wished to return, but the\r\nboy declared himself, and looked, too ill to go back alone. They\r\nescorted him home to the Heights, and Heathcliff persuaded them to\r\nenter, saying he would go for a doctor for his sick lad. But, once they\r\nwere in the house, he showed his hand. The doors were bolted; the\r\nservants and Hareton away. Neither tears nor prayers would induce him to\r\nlet his victims go till Catharine was Linton's wife, and so, he told\r\nher, till her father had died in solitude. But five days after,\r\nCatharine Linton, now Catharine Heathcliff, contrived an escape in time\r\nto console her father's dying hours with a false belief in her\r\nhappiness; a noble lie, for Edgar Linton died contented, kissing his\r\ndaughter's cheek, ignorant of the misery in store for her.\r\n\r\nThe next day Heathcliff came over to the Grange to recapture his prey,\r\nbut now Catharine did not mind; her father dead, she received all the\r\naffronts and stings of fate with an enduring apathy; it was only her\r\nthat they injured. A few days after Linton died in the night, alone with\r\nhis bride. After a year's absolute misery and loneliness, Catharine's\r\nlot was a little lightened by Mr. Heathcliff's preferring Ellen Dean to\r\nthe vacant post of housekeeper at Wuthering Heights.\r\n\r\nFor the all-absorbing presence of Catharine Earnshaw had nearly secluded\r\nHeathcliff from enmity with the world; he was seldom violent now. He\r\nbecame yet more and more disinclined to society, sitting alone, seldom\r\neating, often walking about the whole night. His face changed, and the\r\nlook of brooding hate gave way to a yet more alarming expression--an\r\nexcited, wild, unnatural appearance of joy. He complained of no illness,\r\nyet he was very pale, bloodless, \"and his teeth visible now and then in\r\na kind of smile; his frame shivering, not as one shivers with chill or\r\nweakness, but as a tight-stretched cord vibrates--a strong thrilling,\r\nrather than trembling.\" At last his mysterious absorption, the stress of\r\nhis expectation, became so intense that he could not eat. Animated with\r\nhunger, he would sit down to his meal, then suddenly start, as if he saw\r\nsomething, glance at the door or the window and go out. Weary and pale,\r\nhe could not sleep; but left his bed hurriedly, and went out to pace the\r\ngarden till break of day. \"'It is not my fault,' he replied, 'that I\r\ncannot eat or rest. I assure you it is through no settled design. I'll\r\ndo both as soon as I possibly can. But you might as well bid a man\r\nstruggling in the water rest within arm's-length of the shore. I must\r\nreach it first and then I'll rest. As to repenting of my injustices,\r\nI've done no injustice and I repent of nothing. I'm too happy, and yet\r\nI'm not happy enough. My soul's bliss kills my body, but does not\r\nsatisfy itself.'\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the schemes of a life, the deeply-laid purposes of his\r\nrevenge, were toppling unheeded all round him, like a house of cards.\r\nHis son was dead. Hareton Earnshaw, the real heir of Wuthering Heights,\r\nand Catharine, the real heir of Thrushcross Grange, had fallen in love\r\nwith each other. A most unguessed-at and unlikely finale; yet most\r\nnatural. For Catharine was spoiled, accomplished, beautiful, proud--yet\r\nmost affectionate and tender-hearted: and Hareton rude, surly, ignorant,\r\nfierce; yet true as steel, staunch, and with a very loving faithful\r\nheart, constant even to the man who had, of set purpose, brutalised him\r\nand kept him in servitude. \"'Hareton is damnably fond of me!' laughed\r\nHeathcliff. 'You'll own that I've out-matched Hindley there. If the dead\r\nvillain could rise from the grave to abuse me for his offspring's\r\nwrongs, I should have the fun of seeing the said offspring fight him\r\nback again, indignant that he should dare to rail at the one friend he\r\nhas in the world.'\r\n\r\n\"'He'll never be able to emerge from his bathos of coarseness and\r\nignorance,'\" cried Heathcliff in exultation; but love can do as much as\r\nhatred. Heathcliff, himself as great a boor at twenty, contrived to rub\r\noff his clownishness in order to revenge himself upon his enemies;\r\nCatharine Linton's love inspired Hareton to as great an effort. This\r\nodd, rough love-story, as harshly-sweet as wortle-berries, as dry and\r\nstiff in its beauty as purple heather-sprays, is the most purely human,\r\nthe only tender interest of Wuthering Heights. It is the necessary and\r\nlawful anti-climax to Heathcliff's triumph, the final reassertion of the\r\npre-eminence of right. \"Conquered good, and conquering ill\" is often\r\npitiably true; but not an everlasting law, only a too frequent accident.\r\nPerceiving this, Emily Bronte shows the final discomfiture of\r\nHeathcliff, who, kinless and kithless, was in the end compelled to see\r\nthe property he has so cruelly amassed descend to his hereditary\r\nenemies. And he was baffled, not so much by Cathy's and Hareton's love\r\naffairs as by this sudden reaction from violence, this slackening of the\r\nheartstrings, which left him nerveless and anaemic, a prey to encroaching\r\nmonomania. He had spent his life in crushing the berries for his\r\nrevenge, in mixing that dark and maddening draught; and when the final\r\nmoment came, when he lifted it to his lips, desire had left him, he had\r\nno taste for it.\r\n\r\n\"I've done no injustices,\" said Heathcliff; and though his life had been\r\nanimated by hate, revenge and passion, let us reflect who have been his\r\nvictims. Not the old Squire who first sheltered him; for the old man\r\nnever lived to know his favourite's baseness, and only derived comfort\r\nfrom his presence. Catharine Earnshaw suffered, not from the character\r\nof her lover, but because she married a man she merely liked, with her\r\neyes open to the fact that she was thereby wronging the man she loved.\r\n\"You deserve this,\" said Heathcliff, when she was dying. \"You have\r\nkilled yourself. Because misery and degradation and death, and nothing\r\nthat God or Satan could inflict would ever have parted us: _you_, of\r\nyour own will, did it.\" Not the morality of Mayfair, but one whose\r\nlessons, stern and grim enough, must ever be sorrowfully patent to such\r\nerring and passionate spirits. The third of Heathcliff's victims then,\r\nor rather the first, was Hindley Earnshaw. But if Hindley had not\r\nalready been a gamester and a drunkard, a violent and soulless man,\r\nHeathcliff could have gained no power over him. Hindley welcomed\r\nHeathcliff, as Faustus the Devil, because he could gratify his evil\r\ndesires; because, in his presence, there was no need to remember shame,\r\nnor high purposes, nor forsaken goodness; and when the end comes, and he\r\nshall forfeit his soul, let him remember that there were two at that\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nIsabella Linton was the most pitiable sufferer. Victim we can scarcely\r\ncall her, who required no deception, but courted her doom. And after\r\nall, a marriage chiefly desired in order to humiliate a sister-in-law\r\nand show the bride to be a person of importance, was not intolerably\r\nrequited by three months of wretched misery; after so much she is\r\nsuffered to escape. From Edgar Linton, as we have seen, Heathcliff's\r\nblows fell aside unharming, as the executioner's strokes from a\r\nlegendary martyr. He never learnt how secondary a place he held in his\r\nwife's heart, he never knew the misery of his only daughter--misery soon\r\nto be turned into joy. He lived and died, patient, happy, trustful,\r\nunvisited by the violence and fury that had their centre so near his\r\nhearth.\r\n\r\nThe younger Catharine and Hareton suffered but a temporary ill; the\r\nmisery they endured together taught them to love; the tyrant's rod had\r\nblossomed into roses. And he, lonely and palsied at heart, eating out\r\nhis soul in bitter solitude, he saw his plans of vengeance all\r\nfrustrated, so much elaboration so simply counteracted; it was he that\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\nHe suffered now: and Catharine Earnshaw who helped him to ruin by her\r\ndesertion, and Hindley who perverted him by early oppression, they\r\nsuffered at his hands. But not the sinless, the constant, the noble;\r\nmisery, in the end, shifts its dull mists before the light of such clear\r\nspirits: [Greek: ta drasanti pathein].\r\n\r\n\"'It is a poor conclusion, is it not?' said Heathcliff, 'an absurd\r\ntermination to my violent exertions. I get levers and mattocks to\r\ndemolish the two houses, and train myself to be capable of working like\r\nHercules, and when everything is ready and in my power, I find the will\r\nto lift a slate off either roof has vanished.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Five minutes ago Hareton seemed to be a personification of my youth,\r\nnot a human being: I felt to him in such a variety of ways that it would\r\nhave been impossible to have accosted him rationally. In the first\r\nplace, his startling likeness to Catharine connected him fearfully with\r\nher. That, however, which you may suppose the most potent to arrest my\r\nimagination is in reality the least: for what is not connected with her\r\nto me? and what does not recall her? I cannot look down to the floor but\r\nher features are shaped in the flags! In every cloud, in every\r\ntree--filling the air by night and caught by glimpses in every object by\r\nday--I am surrounded by her image. The most ordinary faces of men and\r\nwomen--my own features--mock me with a resemblance. The entire world is\r\na dreadful collection of memoranda that she did exist, and that I have\r\nlost her! Well, Hareton's aspect was the ghost of my immortal love; of\r\nmy wild endeavours to hold my right; my degradation, my pride, my\r\nhappiness, and my anguish----\r\n\r\n\"But it is frenzy to repeat these thoughts to you: only it will let you\r\nknow why, with a reluctance to be always alone, his society is no\r\nbenefit; rather an aggravation of the constant torment I suffer; and it\r\npartly contributes to render me regardless how he and his cousin go on\r\ntogether. I can give them no attention any more.\"\r\n\r\nSweet, forward Catharine and coy, passionate Hareton got on very\r\nprettily together. I can recall no more touching and lifelike scene than\r\nthat first love-making of theirs, one rainy afternoon, in the kitchen\r\nwhere Nelly Dean is ironing the linen. Hareton, sulky and miserable,\r\nsitting by the fire, hurt by a gunshot wound, but yet more by the\r\nmanifold rebuffs of pretty Cathy. She, with all her sauciness, limp in\r\nthe dull, wet weather, coaxing him into good temper with the sweetest\r\nadvancing graces. It is strange that in speaking of 'Wuthering Heights'\r\nthis beautiful episode should be so universally forgotten, and only the\r\nviolence and passion of more terrible passages associated with Emily\r\nBronte's name. Yet, out of the strong cometh forth the sweet; and the\r\nbest honey from the dry heather-bells.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Heathcliff let them go on, frightening them more by his\r\nstrange mood of abstraction than by his accustomed ferocity.\r\n\r\nHe could give them no attention any more. For four days he could neither\r\neat nor rest, till his cheeks grew hollow and his eyes bloodshot, like a\r\nperson starving with hunger, and growing blind with loss of sleep.\r\n\r\nAt last one early morning, when the rain was streaming in at\r\nHeathcliff's flapping lattice, Nelly Dean, like a good housewife, went\r\nin to shut it to. The master must be up or out, she said. But pushing\r\nback the panels of the inclosed bed, she found him there, laid on his\r\nback, his open eyes keen and fierce; quite still, though his face and\r\nthroat were washed with rain; quite still, with a frightful, lifelike\r\ngaze of exultation under his brows, with parted lips and sharp white\r\nteeth that sneered--quite still and harmless now; dead and stark.\r\n\r\nDead, before any vengeance had overtaken him other than the slow,\r\nretributive sufferings of his own breast; dead, slain by too much hope,\r\nand an unnatural joy. Never before had any villain so strange an end;\r\nnever before had any sufferer so protracted and sinister a torment,\r\n\"beguiled with the spectre of a hope through eighteen years.\"\r\n\r\nNo more public nor authoritative punishment. Hareton passionately\r\nmourned his lost tyrant, weeping in bitter earnest, and kissing the\r\nsarcastic, savage face that every one else shrunk from contemplating.\r\nAnd Heathcliff's memory was sacred, having in the youth he ruined a most\r\nvaliant defender. Even Catharine might never bemoan his wickednesses to\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nNo execrations in this world or the next; a great quiet envelops him.\r\nHis violence was not strong enough to reach that final peace and mar its\r\ncompleteness. [His] grave is next to Catharine's, and near to Edgar\r\nLinton's; over them all the wild bilberry springs, and the peat-moss and\r\nheather. They do not reck of the passion, the capricious sweetness, the\r\nsteady goodness that lie underneath. It is all one to them and to the\r\nlarks singing aloft.\r\n\r\n\"I lingered round the graves under that benign sky; watched the moths\r\nfluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind\r\nbreathing through the grass; and wondered how any one could ever imagine\r\nunquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.\"\r\n\r\nSo ends the story of Wuthering Heights.\r\n\r\nThe world is now agreed to accept that story as a great and tragic study\r\nof passion and sorrow, a wild picture of storm and moorland, of outraged\r\ngoodness and ingratitude. The world which has crowned 'King Lear' with\r\nimmortality, keeps a lesser wreath for 'Wuthering Heights.' But in 1848,\r\nthe peals of triumph which acclaimed the success of 'Jane Eyre' had no\r\necho for the work of Ellis Bell. That strange genius, brooding and\r\nforeboding, intense and narrow, was passed over, disregarded. One\r\nauthor, indeed, in one review, Sydney Dobell, in the _Palladium_ spoke\r\nnobly and clearly of the energy and genius of this book; but when that\r\nclarion augury of fame at last was sounded, Emily did not hear. Two\r\nyears before they had laid her in the tomb.\r\n\r\nNo praise for Ellis Bell. It is strange to think that of Charlotte's two\r\nsisters it was Anne who had the one short draught of exhilarating fame.\r\nWhen the 'Tenant of Wildfell Hall' was in proof, Ellis's and Acton's\r\npublisher sold it to an American firm as the last and finest production\r\nof the author of 'Jane Eyre' and 'Wuthering Heights.' Strange, that even\r\na publisher could so blunder, even for his own interest. However, this\r\nmistake caused sufficient confusion at Cornhill to make it necessary\r\nthat the famous Charlotte, accompanied by Anne, in her quality of\r\nsecondary and mistakable genius, should go to town and explain their\r\nseparate existence. No need to disturb the author of 'Wuthering\r\nHeights,' that crude work of a 'prentice hand, over whose reproduction\r\nno publishers quarrelled; such troublesome honours were not for her.\r\n\r\n\"Yet,\" says Charlotte, \"I must not be understood to make these things\r\nsubject for reproach or complaint; I dare not do so; respect for my\r\nsister's memory forbids me. By her any such querulous manifestation\r\nwould have been regarded as an unworthy and offensive weakness.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, indeed, did the murmur of complaint pass those pale, inspired\r\nlips? Failure can have come to her with no shock of aghast surprise. All\r\nher plans had failed; Branwell's success, the school, her poems: her\r\nstrong will, had not carried them on to success.\r\n\r\nBut though it could not bring success, it could support her against\r\ndespair. When this last, dearest, strongest work of hers was weighed in\r\nthe world's scales and found wanting, she did not sigh, resign herself,\r\nand think the battle over; she would have fought again.\r\n\r\nBut the battle was over, over before victory was declared. No more\r\nfailures, no more strivings for that brave spirit. It was in July that\r\nCharlotte and Anne returned from London, in July when the heather is in\r\nbud; scarce one last withered spray was left in December to place on\r\nEmily's deathbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n'SHIRLEY.'\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile 'Wuthering Heights' was still in the reviewer's hands, Emily\r\nBronte's more fortunate sister was busy on another novel. This book has\r\nnever attained the steady success of her masterpiece, 'Villette,'\r\nneither did it meet with the _furor_ which greeted the first appearance\r\nof 'Jane Eyre.' It is, indeed, inferior to either work; a very quiet\r\nstudy of Yorkshire life, almost pettifogging in its interest in\r\necclesiastical squabbles, almost absurd in the feminine inadequacy of\r\nits heroes. And yet 'Shirley' has a grace and beauty of its own. This it\r\nderives from the charm of its heroines--Caroline Helstone, a lovely\r\nportrait in character of Charlotte's dearest friend, and Shirley\r\nherself, a fancy likeness of Emily Bronte.\r\n\r\nEmily Bronte, but under very different conditions. No longer poor, no\r\nlonger thwarted, no longer acquainted with misery and menaced by\r\nuntimely death; not thus, but as a loving sister would fain have seen\r\nher, beautiful, triumphant, the spoiled child of happy fortune. Yet in\r\nthese altered circumstances Shirley keeps her likeness to Charlotte's\r\nhardworking sister; the disguise, haply baffling those who, like Mrs.\r\nGaskell, \"have not a pleasant impression of Emily Bronte,\" is very\r\neasily penetrated by those who love her. Under the pathetic finery so\r\nlovingly bestowed, under the borrowed splendours of a thousand a year,\r\na lovely face, an ancestral manor-house, we recognise our hardy and\r\nheadstrong heroine, and smile a little sadly at the inefficiency of this\r\nmasquerade of grandeur, so indifferent and unnecessary to her. We\r\nrecognise Charlotte's sister; but not the author of 'Wuthering Heights.'\r\nThrough these years we discern the brilliant heiress to be a person of\r\ninfinitely inferior importance to the ill-dressed and overworked Vicar's\r\ndaughter. Imperial Shirley, no need to wave your majestic wand, we have\r\nbowed to it long ago unblinded; and all its illusive splendours are not\r\nso potent as that worn-down goose-quill which you used to wield in the\r\nbusy kitchen of your father's parsonage.\r\n\r\nYet without that admirable portrait we should have scant warrant for our\r\nconception of Emily Bronte's character. Her work is singularly\r\nimpersonal. You gather from it that she loved the moors, that from her\r\nyouth up the burden of a tragic fancy had lain hard upon her; that she\r\nhad seen the face of sorrow close, meeting that Medusa-glance with rigid\r\nand defiant fortitude. So much we learn; but this is very little--a\r\none-sided truth and therefore scarcely a truth at all.\r\n\r\nCharlotte's portrait gives us another view, and fortunately there are\r\nstill a few alive of the not numerous friends of Emily Bronte. Every\r\ntrait, every reminiscence paints in darker, clearer lines, the\r\nimpression of character which 'Shirley' leaves upon us. Shirley is\r\nindeed the exterior Emily, the Emily that was to be met and known\r\nthirty-five years ago, only a little polished, with the angles a little\r\nsmoothed, by a sister's anxious care. The nobler Emily,\r\ndeeply-suffering, brooding, pitying, creating, is only to be found in a\r\nstray word here and there, a chance memory, a happy answer, gathered\r\nfrom the pages of her work, and the loving remembrance of her friends;\r\nbut these remnants are so direct, unusual, personal, and characteristic,\r\nthis outline is of so decided a type, that it affects us more distinctly\r\nthan many stippled and varnished portraits do.\r\n\r\nBut to know how Emily Bronte looked, moved, sat and spoke, we still\r\nreturn to 'Shirley.' A host of corroborating memories start up in\r\nturning the pages. Who but Emily was always accompanied by a \"rather\r\nlarge, strong, and fierce-looking dog, very ugly, being of a breed\r\nbetween a mastiff and a bulldog?\" it is familiar to us as Una's lion; we\r\ndo not need to be told, Currer Bell, that she always sat on the\r\nhearthrug of nights, with her hand on his head, reading a book; we\r\nremember well how necessary it was to secure him as an ally in winning\r\nher affection. Has not a dear friend informed us that she first obtained\r\nEmily's heart by meeting, without apparent fear or shrinking, Keeper's\r\nhuge springs of demonstrative welcome?\r\n\r\nCertainly \"Captain Keeldar,\" with her cavalier airs, her ready disdain,\r\nher love of independence, does bring back with vivid brilliance the\r\nmemory of our old acquaintance, \"the Major.\" We recognise that pallid\r\nslimness, masking an elastic strength which seems impenetrable to\r\nfatigue--and we sigh, recalling a passage in Anne's letters, recording\r\nhow, when rheumatism, coughs, and influenza made an hospital of Haworth\r\nVicarage during the visitations of the dread east wind, Emily alone\r\nlooked on and wondered why anyone should be ill--\"she considers it a\r\nvery uninteresting wind; it does not affect her nervous system.\" We know\r\nher, too, by her kindness to her inferiors. A hundred little stories\r\nthrong our minds. Unforgotten delicacies made with her own hands for her\r\nservant's friend, yet-remembered visits of Martha's little cousin to the\r\nkitchen, where Miss Emily would bring in her own chair for the ailing\r\ngirl; anecdotes of her early rising through many years to do the hardest\r\nwork, because the first servant was too old, and the second too young to\r\nget up so soon; and she, Emily, was so strong. A hundred little\r\nsacrifices, dearer to remembrance than Shirley's open purse, awaken in\r\nour hearts and remind us that, after all, Emily was the nobler and more\r\nlovable heroine of the twain.\r\n\r\nHow characteristic, too, the touch that makes her scornful of all that\r\nis dominant, dogmatic, avowedly masculine in the men of her\r\nacquaintance; and gentleness itself to the poetic Philip Nunnely, the\r\ngay, boyish Mr. Sweeting, the sentimental Louis, the lame, devoted\r\nboy-cousin who loves her in pathetic canine fashion. That courage, too,\r\nwas hers. Not only Shirley's flesh, but Emily's, felt the tearing fangs\r\nof the mad dog to whom she had charitably offered food and water; not\r\nonly Shirley's flesh, but hers, shrank from the light scarlet, glowing\r\ntip of the Italian iron with which she straightway cauterised the wound,\r\ngoing quickly into the laundry and operating on herself without a word\r\nto any one.\r\n\r\nEmily, also, singlehanded and unarmed, punished her great bulldog for\r\nhis household misdemeanours, in defiance of an express warning not to\r\nstrike the brute, lest his uncertain temper should rouse him to fly at\r\nthe striker's throat. And it was she who fomented his bruises. This\r\nprowess and tenderness of Shirley's is an old story to us.\r\n\r\nAnd Shirley's love of picturesque and splendid raiment is not without an\r\necho in our memories. It was Emily who, shopping in Bradford with\r\nCharlotte and her friend, chose a white stuff patterned with lilac\r\nthunder and lightning, to the scarcely concealed horror of her more\r\nsober companions. And she looked well in it; a tall, lithe creature,\r\nwith a grace half-queenly, half-untamed in her sudden, supple movements,\r\nwearing with picturesque negligence her ample purple-splashed skirts;\r\nher face clear and pale; her very dark and plenteous brown hair fastened\r\nup behind with a Spanish comb; her large grey-hazel eyes, now full of\r\nindolent, indulgent humour, now glimmering with hidden meanings, now\r\nquickened into flame by a flash of indignation, \"a red ray piercing the\r\ndew.\"\r\n\r\nShe, too, had Shirley's taste for the management of business. We\r\nremember Charlotte's disquiet when Emily insisted on investing Miss\r\nBranwell's legacies in York and Midland Railway shares. \"She managed, in\r\na most handsome and able manner for me when I was in Brussels, and\r\nprevented by distance from looking after our interests, therefore I will\r\nlet her manage still and take the consequences. Disinterested and\r\nenergetic she certainly is; and, if she be not quite so tractable or\r\nopen to conviction as I could wish, I must remember perfection is not\r\nthe lot of humanity, and, as long as we can regard those whom we love,\r\nand to whom we are closely allied, with profound and never-shaken\r\nesteem, it is a small thing that they should vex us occasionally by what\r\nappear to us headstrong and unreasonable notions.\"[28]\r\n\r\nSo speaks the kind elder sister, the author of 'Shirley.' But there are\r\nsome who will never love either type or portrait. Sydney Dobell spoke a\r\nbitter half-truth when, ignorant of Shirley's real identity, he\r\ndeclared: \"We have only to imagine Shirley Keeldar poor to imagine her\r\nrepulsive.\" The silenced pride, the thwarted generosity, the unspoken\r\npower, the contained passion of such a nature are not qualities which\r\ntouch the world when it finds them in an obscure and homely woman. Even\r\nnow, very many will not love a heroine so independent of their esteem.\r\nThey will resent the frank imperiousness, caring not to please, the\r\nunyielding strength, the absence of trivial submissive tendernesses, for\r\nwhich she makes amends by such large humane and generous compassion. \"In\r\nEmily's nature,\" says her sister, \"the extremes of vigour and simplicity\r\nseemed to meet. Under an unsophisticated culture, inartificial taste and\r\nan unpretending outside, lay a power and fire that might have informed\r\nthe brain and kindled the veins of a hero; but she had no worldly\r\nwisdom--her powers were unadapted to the practical business of life--she\r\nwould fail to defend her most manifest rights, to consult her legitimate\r\nadvantage. An interpreter ought always to have stood between her and the\r\nworld. Her will was not very flexible and it generally opposed her\r\ninterest. Her temper was magnanimous, but warm and sudden; her spirit\r\naltogether unbending.\"[29]\r\n\r\nSo speaks Emily's inspired interpreter, whose genius has not made her\r\nsister popular. 'Shirley' is not a favourite with a modern public. Emily\r\nBronte was born out of date. Athene, leading the nymphs in their\r\nheadlong chase down the rocky spurs of Olympus, and stopping in full\r\ncareer to lift in her arms the weanlings, tender as dew, or the\r\nchance-hurt cubs of the mountain, might have chosen her as her\r\nhunt-fellow. Or Brunhilda, the strong Valkyr, dreading the love of man,\r\nwhose delight is battle and the wild summits of hills, forfeiting her\r\nimmortality to shield the helpless and the weak; she would have\r\nrecognised the kinship of this last-born sister. But we moderns care not\r\nfor these. Our heroines are Juliet, Desdemona and Imogen, our examples\r\nDorothea Brooke and Laura Pendennis, women whose charm is a certain\r\nfragrance of affection. 'Shirley' is too independent for our taste; and,\r\nfor the rest, we are all in love with Caroline Helstone.\r\n\r\nDisinterested, headstrong, noble Emily Bronte, at this time, while your\r\nmagical sister was weaving for you, with golden words, a web of fate as\r\nfortunate as dreams, the true Norns were spinning a paler shrouding\r\ngarment. You were never to see the brightest things in life. Sisterly\r\nlove, free solitude, unpraised creation, were to remain your most\r\npoignant joys. No touch of love, no hint of fame, no hours of ease, lie\r\nfor you across the knees of Fate. Neither rose nor laurel will be shed\r\non your coffined form. Meanwhile, your sister writes and dreams for\r\nShirley. Terrible difference between ideas and truth; wonderful magic of\r\nthe unreal to take their sting from the veritable wounds we endure!\r\n\r\nNeither rose nor laurel will we lay reverently for remembrance over the\r\ntomb where you sleep; but the flower that was always your own, the wild,\r\ndry heather. You, who were, in your sister's phrase, \"moorish, wild and\r\nknotty as a root of heath,\" you grew to your own perfection on the waste\r\nwhere no laurel rustles its polished leaves, where no sweet, fragile\r\nrose ever opened in the heart of June. The storm and the winter\r\ndarkness, the virgin earth, the blasting winds of March, would have\r\nslain them utterly; but all these served to make the heather light and\r\nstrong, to flush its bells with a ruddier purple, to fill its cells with\r\nhoney more pungently sweet. The cold wind and wild earth make the\r\nheather; it would not grow in the sheltered meadows. And you, had you\r\nknown the fate that love would have chosen, you too would not have\r\nthrived in your full bloom. Another happy, prosperous north-country\r\nmatron would be dead. But now you live, still singing of freedom, the\r\nundying soul of courage and loneliness, another voice in the wind,\r\nanother glory on the mountain-tops, Emily Bronte, the author of\r\n'Wuthering Heights.'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Mrs. Gaskell.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: 'Biographical Notice.'

Those\r\nchilling blasts whirling round the small grey parsonage on its exposed\r\nhill-top, brought sickness in their train. Anne and Charlotte drooped\r\nand languished; Branwell, too, was ill. His constitution seemed\r\nshattered by excesses which he had not the resolution to forego. Often\r\nhe would sleep most of the day; or at least sit dosing hour after hour\r\nin a lethargy of weakness; but with the night this apathy would change\r\nto violence and suffering. \"Papa, and sometimes all of us have sad\r\nnights with him,\" writes Charlotte in the last days of July.\r\n\r\nYet, so well the little household knew the causes of this reverse, no\r\nimmediate danger was suspected. He was weak, certainly, and his appetite\r\nfailed; but opium-eaters are not strong nor hungry. Neither Branwell\r\nhimself, nor his relations, nor any physician consulted in his case\r\nthought it one of immediate danger; it seemed as if this dreary life\r\nmight go on for ever, marking its hours by a perpetual swing and rebound\r\nof excess and suffering.\r\n\r\nDuring this melancholy autumn Mr. Grundy was staying at Skipton, a town\r\nabout seventeen miles from Haworth. Mindful of his old friend, he\r\ninvited Branwell to be his guest; but the dying youth was too weak to\r\nmake even that little journey, although he longed for the excitement of\r\nchange. Mr. Grundy was so much moved by the miserable tone of Branwell's\r\nletter that he drove over to Haworth to see for himself what ailed his\r\nold companion. He was very shocked at the change. Pale, sunk, tremulous,\r\nutterly wrecked; there was no hope for Branwell now; he had again taken\r\nto eating opium.\r\n\r\nAnything for excitement, for a variation to his incessant sorrow. Weak\r\nas he was, and scarcely able to leave his bed, he craved piteously for\r\nan appointment of any kind, any reason for leaving Haworth, for getting\r\nquit of his old thoughts, any post anywhere for Heaven's sake so it were\r\nout of their whispering. He had not long to wait.\r\n\r\nLater in that cold and bleak September Mr. Grundy again visited Haworth.\r\nHe sent to the Vicarage for Branwell, and ordered dinner and a fire to\r\nwelcome him; the room looked cosy and warm. While Mr. Grundy sat waiting\r\nfor his guest, the Vicar was shown in. He, too, was strangely altered;\r\nmuch of his old stiffness of manner gone; and it was with genuine\r\naffection that he spoke of Branwell, and almost with despair that he\r\ntouched on his increasing miseries. When Mr. Grundy's message had come,\r\nthe poor, self-distraught sufferer had been lying ill in bed, apparently\r\ntoo weak to move; but the feverish restlessness which marked his latter\r\nyears was too strong to resist the chance of excitement. He had insisted\r\nupon coming, so his father said, and would immediately be ready. Then\r\nthe sorrowful half-blind old gentleman made his adieus to his son's\r\nhost, and left the inn.\r\n\r\n     \"Presently the door opened cautiously, and a head appeared.\r\n     It was a mass of red, unkempt, uncut hair, wildly floating\r\n     round a great, gaunt forehead; the cheeks yellow and hollow,\r\n     the mouth fallen, the thin white lips not trembling but\r\n     shaking, the sunken eyes, once small, now glaring with the\r\n     light of madness--all told the sad tale but too surely. I\r\n     hastened to my friend, greeted him in my gayest manner, as I\r\n     knew he best liked, drew him quickly into the room, and\r\n     forced upon him a stiff glass of hot brandy. Under its\r\n     influence and that of the bright, cheerful surroundings, he\r\n     looked frightened--frightened of himself. He glanced at me a\r\n     moment, and muttered something of leaving a warm bed to come\r\n     out in the cold night. Another glass of brandy, and\r\n     returning warmth gradually brought him back to something\r\n     like the Bronte of old. He even ate some dinner, a thing\r\n     which he said he had not done for long; so our last\r\n     interview was pleasant though grave. I never knew his\r\n     intellect clearer. He described himself as waiting anxiously\r\n     for death--indeed, longing for it, and happy, in these his\r\n     sane moments, to think it was so near. He once again\r\n     declared that that death would be due to the story I knew,\r\n     and to nothing else.\r\n\r\n     \"When at last I was compelled to leave, he quietly drew from\r\n     his coat-sleeve a carving-knife, placed it on the table,\r\n     and, holding me by both hands, said that, having given up\r\n     all hopes of ever seeing me again, he imagined when my\r\n     message came that it was a call from Satan. Dressing\r\n     himself, he took the knife which he had long secreted, and\r\n     came to the inn, with a full determination to rush into the\r\n     room and stab the occupant. In the excited state of his\r\n     mind, he did not recognise me when he opened the door, but\r\n     my voice and manner conquered him, and 'brought him home to\r\n     himself,' as he expressed it. I left him standing\r\n     bare-headed in the road with bowed form and dropping\r\n     tears.\"[30]\r\n\r\nHe went home, and a few days afterwards he died. That little intervening\r\ntime was happier and calmer than any he had known for years; his evil\r\nhabits, his hardened feelings slipped, like a mask, from the soul\r\nalready touched by the final quiet. He was singularly altered and\r\nsoftened, gentle and loving to the father and sisters who had borne so\r\nmuch at his hands. It was as though he had awakened from the fierce\r\ndelirium of a fever; weak though he was and shattered, they could again\r\nrecognise in him their Branwell of old times, the hope and promise of\r\nall their early dreams. Neither they nor he dreamed that the end was so\r\nnear; he had often talked of death, but now that he stood in the shadow\r\nof its wings, he was unconscious of that subduing presence. And it is\r\npleasant to think that the sweet demeanour of his last days was not\r\nowing to the mere cowardly fear of death; but rather a return of the\r\nsoul to its true self, a natural dropping-off of all extraneous fever\r\nand error, before the suffering of its life should close. Half an hour\r\nbefore he died Branwell was unconscious of danger; he was out in the\r\nvillage two days before, and was only confined to bed one single day.\r\nThe next morning was a Sunday, the twenty-fourth of September. Branwell\r\nawoke to it perfectly conscious, and through the holy quiet of that\r\nearly morning he lay, troubled by neither fear nor suffering, while the\r\nbells of the neighbouring church, the neighbouring tower whose fabulous\r\nantiquity had furnished him with many a boyish pleasantry, called the\r\nvillagers to worship. They all knew him, all as they passed the house\r\nwould look up and wonder if \"t' Vicar's Patrick\" were better or worse.\r\nBut those of the Parsonage were not at church: they watched in\r\nBranwell's hushed and peaceful chamber.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a terrible change came over the quiet face; there was no\r\nmistaking the sudden, heart-shaking summons. And now Charlotte sank;\r\nalways nervous and highly strung, the mere dread of what might be to\r\ncome, laid her prostrate. They led her away, and for a week she kept her\r\nbed in sickness and fever. But Branwell, the summoned, the actual\r\nsufferer, met death with a different face. He insisted upon getting up;\r\nif he had succumbed to the horrors of life he would defy the horrors of\r\nextinction; he would die as he thought no one had ever died before,\r\nstanding. So, like some ancient Celtic hero, when the last agony began,\r\nhe rose to his feet; hushed and awe-stricken, the old father, praying\r\nAnne, loving Emily, looked on. He rose to his feet and died erect after\r\ntwenty minutes' struggle.\r\n\r\nThey found his pockets filled with the letters of the woman he had so\r\npassionately loved.\r\n\r\nHe was dead, this Branwell who had wrung the hearts of his household day\r\nby day, who drank their tears as wine. He was dead, and now they mourned\r\nhim with acute and bitter pain. \"All his vices were and are nothing now;\r\nwe remember only his woes,\" writes Charlotte. They buried him in the\r\nsame vault that had been opened twenty-three years ago to receive the\r\nchildish, wasted corpses of Elizabeth and Maria. Sunday came round,\r\nrecalling minute by minute the ebbing of his life, and Emily Bronte,\r\npallid and dressed in black, can scarcely have heard her brother's\r\nfuneral sermon for looking at the stone which hid so many memories, such\r\nuseless compassion. She took her brother's death very much to heart,\r\ngrowing thin and pale and saying nothing. She had made an effort to go\r\nto church that Sunday, and as she sat there, quiet and hollow-eyed,\r\nperhaps she felt it was well that she had looked upon his resting-place,\r\nupon the grave where so much of her heart was buried. For, after his\r\nfuneral, she never rallied; a cold and cough, taken then, gained fearful\r\nhold upon her, and she never went out of doors after that memorable\r\nSunday.\r\n\r\nBut looking on her quiet, uncomplaining eyes, you would not have guessed\r\nso much.\r\n\r\n\"Emily and Anne are pretty well,\" says Charlotte, on the ninth of\r\nOctober, \"though Anne is always delicate and Emily has a cold and cough\r\nat present.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: 'Pictures of the Past.']\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nEMILY'S DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready by the 29th of October of this melancholy year of 1848 Emily's\r\ncough and cold had made such progress as to alarm her careful elder\r\nsister. Before Branwell's death she had been, to all appearance, the one\r\nstrong member of a delicate family. By the side of fragile Anne\r\n(already, did they but know it, advanced in tubercular consumption), of\r\nshattered Branwell, of Charlotte, ever nervous and ailing, this tall,\r\nmuscular Emily had appeared a tower of strength. Working early and late,\r\nseldom tired and never complaining, finding her best relaxation in long,\r\nrough walks on the moors, she seemed unlikely to give them any poignant\r\nanxiety. But the seeds of phthisis lay deep down beneath this fair show\r\nof life and strength; the shock of sorrow which she experienced for her\r\nbrother's death developed them with alarming rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe weariness of absence had always proved too much for Emily's\r\nstrength. Away from home we have seen how she pined and sickened. Exile\r\nmade her thin and wan, menaced the very springs of life. And now she\r\nmust endure an inevitable and unending absence, an exile from which\r\nthere could be no return. The strain was too tight, the wrench too\r\nsharp: Emily could not bear it and live. In such a loss as hers,\r\nbereaved of a helpless sufferer, the mourning of those who remain is\r\nembittered and quickened a hundred times a day when the blank minutes\r\ncome round for which the customary duties are missing, when the\r\nunwelcome leisure hangs round the weary soul like a shapeless and\r\nencumbering garment. It was Emily who had chiefly devoted herself to\r\nBranwell. He being dead, the motive of her life seemed gone.\r\n\r\nHad she been stronger, had she been more careful of herself at the\r\nbeginning of her illness, she would doubtless have recovered, and we\r\nshall never know the difference in our literature which a little\r\nprecaution might have made. But Emily was accustomed to consider herself\r\nhardy; she was so used to wait upon others that to lie down and be\r\nwaited on would have appeared to her ignominious and absurd. Both her\r\nindependence and her unselfishness made her very chary of giving\r\ntrouble. It is, moreover, extremely probable that she never realised the\r\nextent of her own illness; consumption is seldom a malady that despairs;\r\nattacking the body it leaves the spirit free, the spirit which cannot\r\nrealise a danger by which it is not injured. A little later on when it\r\nwas Anne's turn to suffer, she is choosing her spring bonnet four days\r\nbefore her death. Which of us does not remember some such pathetic tale\r\nof the heart-wringing, vain confidence of those far gone in phthisis,\r\nwho bear on their faces the marks of death for all eyes but their own to\r\nread?\r\n\r\nTo those who look on, there is no worse agony than to watch the brave\r\nbearing of these others unconscious of the sudden grave at their feet.\r\nCharlotte and Anne looked on and trembled. On the 29th of October,\r\nCharlotte, still delicate from the bilious fever which had prostrated\r\nher on the day of Branwell's death, writes these words already full of\r\nforeboding:\r\n\r\n     \"I feel much more uneasy about my sister than myself just\r\n     now. Emily's cold and cough are very obstinate. I fear she\r\n     has pain in her chest, and I sometimes catch a shortness in\r\n     her breathing when she has moved at all quickly. She looks\r\n     very thin and pale. Her reserved nature occasions me great\r\n     uneasiness of mind. It is useless to question her; you get\r\n     no answer. It is still more useless to recommend remedies;\r\n     they are never adopted.\"[31]\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, an acute inflammation of the lungs which this\r\nunfortunate sufferer was trying to subdue by force of courage. To\r\npersons of strong will it is difficult to realise that their disease is\r\nnot in their own control. To be ill, is with them an act of\r\nacquiescence; they have consented to the demands of their feeble body.\r\nWhen necessity demands the sacrifice, it seems to them so easy to deny\r\nthemselves the rest, the indulgence. They set their will against their\r\nweakness and mean to conquer. They will not give up.\r\n\r\nEmily would not give up. She felt herself doubly necessary to the\r\nhousehold in this hour of trial. Charlotte was still very weak and\r\nailing. Anne, her dear little sister, was unusually delicate and frail.\r\nEven her father had not quite escaped. That she, Emily, who had always\r\nbeen relied upon for strength and courage and endurance, should show\r\nherself unworthy of the trust when she was most sorely needed; that she,\r\nso inclined to take all duties on herself, so necessary to the daily\r\nmanagement of the house, should throw up her charge in this moment of\r\ntrial, cast away her arms in the moment of battle, and give her\r\nfellow-sufferers the extra burden of her weakness; such a thing was\r\nimpossible to her.\r\n\r\nSo the vain struggle went on. She would resign no one of her duties, and\r\nit was not till within the last weeks of her life that she would so much\r\nas suffer the servant to rise before her in the morning and take the\r\nearly work. She would not endure to hear of remedies; declaring that she\r\nwas not ill, that she would soon be well, in the pathetic self-delusion\r\nof high-spirited weakness. And Charlotte and Anne, for whose sake she\r\nmade this sacrifice, suffered terribly thereby. Willingly, thankfully\r\nwould they have taken all her duties upon them; they burned to be up and\r\ndoing. But--seeing how weak she was--they dare not cross her; they had\r\nto sit still and endure to see her labour for their comfort with\r\nfaltering and death-cold hands.\r\n\r\n\"Day by day,\" says Charlotte, \"day by day when I saw with what a front\r\nshe met suffering, I looked on her with a wonder of anguish and love. I\r\nhave seen nothing like it; but, indeed, I have never seen her parallel\r\nin anything. Stronger than a man, simpler than a child, her nature stood\r\nalone. The awful point was that, while full of ruth for others, on\r\nherself she had no pity; the spirit was inexorable to the flesh; from\r\nthe trembling hand, the unnerved limbs, the fading eyes, the same\r\nservice was exacted as they had rendered in health. To stand by and\r\nwitness this, and not dare to remonstrate, was a pain no words can\r\nrender.\"\r\n\r\nThe time went on. Anxious to try what influence some friend, not of\r\ntheir own household, might exert upon this wayward sister, Charlotte\r\nthought of inviting Miss Nussey to Haworth. Emily had ever been glad to\r\nwelcome her. But when the time came it was found that the least\r\ndisturbance of the day's routine would only make Emily's burden heavier.\r\nAnd that scheme, too, was relinquished.\r\n\r\nAnother month had gone. Emily, paler and thinner, but none less\r\nresolute, fulfilled her duties with customary exactness, and insisted on\r\nher perfect health with defiant fortitude. On the 23rd of November,\r\nCharlotte writes again:--\r\n\r\n     \"I told you Emily was ill in my last letter. She has not\r\n     rallied yet. She is _very_ ill. I believe if you were to see\r\n     her your impression would be that there is no hope. A more\r\n     hollow, wasted, pallid aspect I have not beheld. The deep,\r\n     tight cough continues; the breathing after the least\r\n     exertion is a rapid pant; and these symptoms are accompanied\r\n     by pains in the chest and side. Her pulse, the only time she\r\n     allowed it to be felt, was found to beat 115 per minute. In\r\n     this state she resolutely refuses to see a doctor; she will\r\n     give no explanation of her feelings; she will scarcely allow\r\n     her feelings to be alluded to.\"\r\n\r\n\"No poisoning doctor\" should come near her, Emily declared with the\r\nirritability of her disease. It was an insult to her will, her resolute\r\nendeavours. She was not, would not, be ill, and could therefore need no\r\ncure. Perhaps she felt, deep in her heart, the conviction that her\r\ncomplaint was mortal; that a delay in the sentence was all that care and\r\nskill could give; for she had seen Maria and Elizabeth fade and die, and\r\nonly lately the physicians had not saved her brother.\r\n\r\nBut Charlotte, naturally, did not feel the same. Unknown to Emily, she\r\nwrote to a great London doctor drawing up a statement of the case and\r\nsymptoms as minute and careful as she could give. But either this\r\ndiagnosis by guesswork was too imperfect, or the physician saw that\r\nthere was no hope; for his opinion was expressed too obscurely to be of\r\nany use. He sent a bottle of medicine, but Emily would not take it.\r\n\r\nDecember came, and still the wondering, anxious sisters knew not what to\r\nthink. By this time Mr. Bronte also had perceived the danger of Emily's\r\nstate, and he was very anxious. Yet she still denied that she was ill\r\nwith anything more grave than a passing weakness; and the pain in her\r\nside and chest appeared to diminish. Sometimes the little household was\r\ntempted to take her at her word, and believe that soon, with the spring,\r\nshe would recover; and then, hearing her cough, listening to the gasping\r\nbreath with which she climbed the short staircase, looking on the\r\nextreme emaciation of her form, the wasted hands, the hollow eyes, their\r\nhearts would suddenly fail. Life was a daily contradiction of hope and\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nThe days drew on towards Christmas; it was already the middle of\r\nDecember, and still Emily was about the house, able to wait upon\r\nherself, to sew for the others, to take an active share in the duties of\r\nthe day. She always fed the dogs herself. One Monday evening, it must\r\nhave been about the 14th of December, she rose as usual to give the\r\ncreatures their supper. She got up, walking slowly, holding out in her\r\nthin hands an apronful of broken meat and bread. But when she reached\r\nthe flagged passage the cold took her; she staggered on the uneven\r\npavement and fell against the wall. Her sisters, who had been sadly\r\nfollowing her, unseen, came forwards much alarmed and begged her to\r\ndesist; but, smiling wanly, she went on and gave Floss and Keeper their\r\nlast supper from her hands.\r\n\r\nThe next morning she was worse. Before her waking, her watching sisters\r\nheard the low, unconscious moaning that tells of suffering continued\r\neven in sleep; and they feared for what the coming year might hold in\r\nstore. Of the nearness of the end they did not dream. Charlotte had\r\nbeen out over the moors, searching every glen and hollow for a sprig of\r\nheather, however pale and dry, to take to her moor-loving sister. But\r\nEmily looked on the flower laid on her pillow with indifferent eyes. She\r\nwas already estranged and alienate from life.\r\n\r\nNevertheless she persisted in rising, dressing herself alone, and doing\r\neverything for herself. A fire had been lit in the room, and Emily sat\r\non the hearth to comb her hair. She was thinner than ever now--the tall,\r\nloose-jointed \"slinky\" girl--her hair in its plenteous dark abundance\r\nwas all of her that was not marked by the branding finger of death. She\r\nsat on the hearth combing her long brown hair. But soon the comb slipped\r\nfrom her feeble grasp into the cinders. She, the intrepid, active Emily,\r\nwatched it burn and smoulder, too weak to lift it, while the nauseous,\r\nhateful odour of burnt bone rose into her face. At last the servant came\r\nin: \"Martha,\" she said, \"my comb's down there; I was too weak to stoop\r\nand pick it up.\"\r\n\r\nI have seen that old, broken comb, with a large piece burned out of it;\r\nand have thought it, I own, more pathetic than the bones of the eleven\r\nthousand virgins at Cologne, or the time-blackened Holy Face of Lucca.\r\nSad, chance confession of human weakness; mournful counterpart of that\r\nchainless soul which to the end maintained its fortitude and rebellion.\r\nThe flesh is weak. Since I saw that relic, the strenuous verse of Emily\r\nBronte's last poem has seemed to me far more heroic, far more moving;\r\nremembering in what clinging and prisoning garments that free spirit was\r\nconfined.\r\n\r\nThe flesh was weak, but Emily would grant it no indulgence. She finished\r\nher dressing, and came very slowly, with dizzy head and tottering steps,\r\ndownstairs into the little bare parlour where Anne was working and\r\nCharlotte writing a letter. Emily took up some work and tried to sew.\r\nHer catching breath, her drawn and altered face were ominous of the end.\r\nBut still a little hope flickered in those sisterly hearts. \"She grows\r\ndaily weaker,\" wrote Charlotte, on that memorable Tuesday morning;\r\nseeing surely no portent that this--this! was to be the last of the days\r\nand the hours of her weakness.\r\n\r\nThe morning drew on to noon, and Emily grew worse. She could no longer\r\nspeak, but--gasping in a husky whisper--she said: \"If you will send for\r\na doctor. I will see him now!\" Alas, it was too late. The shortness of\r\nbreath and rending pain increased; even Emily could no longer conceal\r\nthem. Towards two o'clock her sisters begged her, in an agony, to let\r\nthem put her to bed. \"No, no,\" she cried; tormented with the feverish\r\nrestlessness that comes before the last, most quiet peace. She tried to\r\nrise, leaning with one hand upon the sofa. And thus the chord of life\r\nsnapped. She was dead.\r\n\r\nShe was twenty-nine years old.\r\n\r\nThey buried her, a few days after, under the church pavement; under the\r\nslab of stone where their mother lay, and Maria and Elizabeth and\r\nBranwell.\r\n\r\nShe who had so mourned her brother had verily found him again, and\r\nshould sleep well at his side.\r\n\r\n     [Greek: phile met' autou keisomai, philou meta.]\r\n\r\nAnd though no wind ever rustles over the grave on which no scented\r\nheather springs, nor any bilberry bears its sprigs of greenest leaves\r\nand purple fruit, she will not miss them now; she who wondered how any\r\ncould imagine unquiet slumbers for them that sleep in the quiet earth.\r\n\r\nThey followed her to her grave--her old father, Charlotte, the dying\r\nAnne; and as they left the doors, they were joined by another mourner,\r\nKeeper, Emily's dog. He walked in front of all, first in the rank of\r\nmourners; and perhaps no other creature had known the dead woman quite\r\nso well. When they had lain her to sleep in the dark, airless vault\r\nunder the church, and when they had crossed the bleak churchyard, and\r\nhad entered the empty house again, Keeper went straight to the door of\r\nthe room where his mistress used to sleep, and lay down across the\r\nthreshold. There he howled piteously for many days; knowing not that no\r\nlamentations could wake her any more. Over the little parlour below a\r\ngreat calm had settled. \"Why should we be otherwise than calm,\" says\r\nCharlotte, writing to her friend on the 21st of December. \"The anguish\r\nof seeing her suffer is over; the spectacle of the pains of death is\r\ngone by; the funeral day is past. We feel she is at peace. No need now\r\nto tremble for the hard frost and the keen wind. Emily does not feel\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe death was over, indeed, and the funeral day was past; yet one duty\r\nremained to the heart-wrung mourners, not less poignant than the sight\r\nof the dead changed face, not less crushing than the thud of stones and\r\nclods on the coffin of one beloved. They took the great brown desk in\r\nwhich she used to keep her papers, and sorted and put in order all that\r\nthey found in it. How appealing the sight of that hurried, casual\r\nwriting of a hand now stark in death! How precious each of those pages\r\nwhose like should never be made again till the downfall of the earth in\r\nthe end of time! How near, how utterly cut-off, the Past!\r\n\r\nThey found no novel, half-finished or begun, in the old brown desk which\r\nshe used to rest on her knees, sitting under the thorns. But they\r\ndiscovered a poem, written at the end of Emily's life, profound,\r\nsincere, as befits the last words one has time to speak. It is the most\r\nperfect and expressive of her work: the fittest monument to her heroic\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nThus run the last lines she ever traced:\r\n\r\n          \"No coward soul is mine,\r\n    No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere;\r\n          I see heaven's glories shine,\r\n    And faith shines equal, arming me from fear.\r\n\r\n          \"O God, within my breast,\r\n    Almighty, ever-present Deity!\r\n          Life, that in me has rest,\r\n    As I--undying life--have power in Thee.\r\n\r\n          \"Vain are the thousand creeds\r\n    That move men's hearts: unutterably vain;\r\n          Worthless as withered weeds,\r\n    Or idlest froth amid the boundless main,\r\n\r\n          \"To waken doubt in one\r\n    Holding so fast by thine infinity;\r\n          So surely anchored on\r\n    The steadfast rock of immortality.\r\n\r\n          \"With wide-embracing love\r\n    Thy spirit animates eternal years,\r\n          Pervades and broods above,\r\n    Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears.\r\n\r\n          \"Though earth and man were gone,\r\n    And suns and universes ceased to be,\r\n          And Thou wert left alone,\r\n    Every existence would exist in Thee.\r\n\r\n          \"There is not room for Death,\r\n    No atom that his might could render void;\r\n          Thou--Thou art Being, Breath,\r\n    And what Thou art may never be destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Mrs. Gaskell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS!\r\n\r\n\r\n\"She died in a time of promise.\"\r\n\r\nSo writes Charlotte, in the first flush of her grief. \"She died in a\r\ntime of promise;\" having done much, indeed, having done enough to bring\r\nher powers to ripe perfection. And the fruit of that perfection is\r\ndenied us. She died, between the finishing of labour and the award of\r\npraise. Before the least hint of the immortality that has been awarded\r\nher could reach her in her obscure and distant home. Without one success\r\nin all her life, with her school never kept, her verses never read, her\r\nnovel never praised, her brother dead in ruin. All her ambitions had\r\nflagged and died of the blight. But she was still young, ready to live,\r\neager to try again.\r\n\r\n\"She died in a time of promise. We saw her taken from life in its\r\nprime.\"\r\n\r\nTruly a prime of sorrow, the dark mid-hour of the storm, dark with the\r\ngrief gone by and the blackness of the on-coming grief. With Branwell\r\ndead, with her dearest sister dying, Emily died. Had she lived, what\r\nprofit could she have made of her life? For us, indeed, it would have\r\nbeen well; but for her? Fame in solitude is bitter food; and Anne will\r\ndie in May; and Charlotte six years after; and Emily never could make\r\nnew friends. Better far for her, that loving, faithful spirit, to die\r\nwhile still her life was dear, while still there was hope in the world,\r\nthan to linger on a few years longer, in loneliness and weakness, to\r\nquit in fame and misery a disillusioned life.\r\n\r\n\"She died in a time of promise. We saw her taken from life in its prime.\r\nBut it is God's will, and the place where she is gone is better than\r\nthat she has left.\"\r\n\r\nTruly better, to leave her soul to speak in the world for aye, for the\r\nwind to be stronger for her breath, and the heather more purple from her\r\nheart; better far to be lost in the all-embracing, all-transmuting\r\nprocess of life, than to live in cramped and individual pain. So at\r\nleast, wrong or right, thought this woman who loved the earth so well.\r\nShe was not afraid to die. The thought of death filled her with no\r\nperplexities; but with assured and happy calm. She held it more glorious\r\nthan fame, and sweeter than love, to give her soul to God and her body\r\nto the earth. And which of us shall carp at the belief which made a very\r\npainful life contented?\r\n\r\n\"The thing that irks me most is this shattered prison, after all. I'm\r\ntired of being enclosed here. I'm wearying to escape into that glorious\r\nworld, and to be always there; not seeing it dimly through tears, and\r\nyearning for it through the walls of an aching heart; but really with it\r\nand in it. You think you are better and more fortunate than I, in full\r\nhealth and strength; you are sorry for me--very soon that will be\r\naltered. I shall be sorry for you. I shall be incomparably above and\r\nbeyond you all.\"[32]\r\n\r\nAh, yes; incomparably above and beyond. Not only because of the keen\r\nvision with which she has revealed the glorious world in which her\r\nmemory is fresher wind, and brighter sunshine, not only for that; but\r\nbecause the remembrance of her living self is a most high and noble\r\nprecept. Never before were hands so inspired alike for daily drudgery\r\nand for golden writing never to fade. Never was any heart more\r\nhonourable and strong, nor any more pitiful to shameful weakness.\r\nSeldom, indeed, has any man, more seldom still any woman, owned the\r\ninestimable gift of genius and never once made it an excuse for a\r\nweakness, a violence, a failing, which in other mortals we condemn. No\r\ndeed of hers requires such apology. Therefore, being dead she persuades\r\nus to honour; and not only her works but the memory of her life shall\r\nrise up and praise her, who lived without praise so well.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: 'Wuthering Heights.']\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON:\r\n\r\nPRINTED BY W.
