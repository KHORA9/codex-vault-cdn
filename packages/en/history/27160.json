K. MORTON, HIGH STREET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe series of “Records” of various kinds which will be found in the\r\nfollowing chapters are drawn from personal reminiscences, extending over\r\nmore than half a century, combined with notes collected from many\r\ndifferent sources during at least two-thirds of that period.  In dealing\r\nwith such material one is apt, even unconsciously, to be egotistical, and\r\nto linger too long and too fondly over scenes and incidents of which one\r\nmight say, in Virgilian phrase, _quorum pars_, _si non magna_, _at parva\r\nfui_.  Should the reader deem any portions unduly prolix, he will,\r\nperhaps, kindly excuse it on this score.  But I have known several\r\ninstances, and especially of late two in this neighbourhood, when a\r\nperson advanced in years and of wide experience, has passed away, and\r\nthere has been a general, and doubtless sincere, regret that he has gone,\r\nand all his store of accumulated information gone with him.\r\n\r\nCircumstances have given me such opportunities—and enjoyed so long—of\r\nacquiring a knowledge of Woodhall Spa, and of most matters connected with\r\nit, that I am probably stating only the unvarnished truth, when I say\r\nthat no one else living could bring together the varied details, however\r\ninadequately treated, which will here be found.  Some of them may seem of\r\nsmall importance in the eyes of many—“caviare to the general”—but I have\r\nthought it better that even these minor details should not be consigned\r\nto the limbo of the forgotten, because unrecorded.\r\n\r\nI have approached the subject from different points of view—historical,\r\nanecdotal, naturalist, and archæological, so as to cater for the\r\ndifferent tastes of readers.\r\n\r\nInheriting an interest in Woodhall Spa, hallowed by cherished\r\nassociations, my aim has been so to unfold its many attractions, even in\r\nbeast, bird, and flower, as to communicate an interest in it to others as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nIn publishing a third issue of these Records, I am bound in duty to thank\r\na wide circle of readers for the interest so far taken in the work.  I\r\nhad now hoped to give it a more attractive form, but the low price at\r\nwhich a guide-book must be sold, in order to bring it within the reach of\r\na general public, precludes a more expensive “get-up” of the volume.  The\r\nonly change, therefore, has been that the edition is brought “up to date”\r\nby a few necessary corrections and additions.  To future readers I would\r\nonly say, in Ovidian phrase:—\r\n\r\n    Si qua meo fuerint, ut erunt, vitiosa libello,\r\n    Excusata, precor, Lector amicus, habe.\r\n\r\n                                                         J. CONWAY WALTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.  THE HISTORY OF THE WELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that the discovery of many of our medicinal springs\r\nhas been due to some romantic incident, or, in other cases, to some\r\noccurrence partaking almost of the ludicrous.  At the famed Carlsbad, for\r\ninstance, a princely hunter pursues his stag into the lake where it has\r\nsought refuge, whereupon the unusual cries of his hounds, too eagerly\r\nbreasting the waters, speedily reveal to him the strongly thermal nature\r\nof the spring which feeds the lake, and the discovery has benefited the\r\nthousands who annually frequent that health-giving resort from almost\r\nevery land.  On the other hand, in the case of our own Bath, although\r\nwell known to the ancient Romans—as also in the later case of\r\nBolsover—tradition avers that an unhealthy pig, instinctively “wallowing\r\nin the mire” produced by the oozing spring, and emerging from the\r\nuncleanly bath cured of its ailment, was the humble instrument to\r\ndemonstrate the health-restoring power of the water, to the subsequent\r\nadvantage of suffering humanity.  Other cases, more or less legendary,\r\nmight be adduced; let these suffice.\r\n\r\nThe discovery, however, of the Woodhall water, if leas romantic, is no\r\nmyth, shrouded in the mystery of a distant past, since it has the\r\nadvantage of being, comparatively, of so recent a date, that the\r\nhistorian can consult the contemporary testimony of eyewitnesses still\r\nliving, or of those to whom others have related the particulars from\r\ntheir own personal knowledge.  The following account has been thus\r\ncollected, and put into connected form:—\r\n\r\nIn the early years of this 19th century there lived a certain John\r\nParkinson, Esquire, a scion of a family of position and wealth in the\r\ncounty, who owned, with other property, the estate of Woodhall. {5}\r\nBeing of a speculative and enterprising bent of mind, it is said that he\r\nbecame enamoured of three ideas or projects, which he thought he had the\r\nmeans and opportunity of carrying out.  One of these was to sink a coal\r\nmine, a second was to plant a forest, and a third was to build a city.\r\nFor the last purpose he purchased from the Crown a tract of fenland,\r\nsituated between Revesby and Boston, being an outlying allotment of the\r\noriginal ancient parish of Bolingbroke.  Here be built (about 1816) a\r\nstreet of houses, which he named New Bolingbroke.  The speculation,\r\nhowever, proved a failure, probably owing to the loneliness of the\r\nposition; and it was not till several years later, when the property had\r\npassed into the possession of J. Banks Stanhope, Esq., of Revesby Abbey,\r\nwho spent much money on needed improvements, that the new “city” became a\r\nfairly populous village, as it is at the present time.\r\n\r\nMr. Parkinson’s second project was the planting of a forest.  For this\r\npurpose he secured a large tract of waste moorland, in the parishes of\r\nRoughton and Kirkby, lying to the south of the present road to\r\nHorncastle, and within some two miles eastward of Woodhall Spa.  This\r\nland he planted extensively with fir and oak, and in course of time they\r\nbecame a dense wood.  This growth has since then been largely destroyed\r\nby fire, or has yielded to the woodman’s axe, and at the present time\r\nthere are left not more than forty acres of the original “forest,” the\r\nrest being chiefly open moor, the whole going by the name of “Ostler’s\r\nPlantations,” Mr. Ostler being the agent employed in the work and\r\nbecoming himself (as will be seen) eventually the proprietor.  Thus of\r\ntwo eggs which Mr. Parkinson brooded over, and desired to hatch, one may\r\nbe said to have been addled, and the other did not prove useful to\r\nhimself:—\r\n\r\n    The best laid plans of mice and men\r\n    Gang aft agley.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the third “incubation,” which has, it may fairly be said,\r\nproved (though once more, not to himself) a “golden egg.”  It has been\r\nobserved that he had conceived the idea of searching for coal.  For this\r\npurpose he selected a spot which has since become the site of the\r\nWoodhall well.  It is said that he was guided in this by the advice of a\r\nMr. J. Clarkson, residing at that time at Moorby, not far from his\r\nresidence at Bolingbroke, and who had had some previous experience among\r\nthe Yorkshire coal mines.  The boring was begun in the year 1811, and was\r\ncarried on under the supervision of Mr. Clarkson.  When the shaft had\r\nreached a depth of about 540ft., there occurred an inrush of clear, salt\r\nwater, which compelled the excavators to retreat.  The work was, however,\r\nafterwards resumed, a brick conduit for the water being constructed, and\r\nso, at the cost of great labour, and by shifts of men working day and\r\nnight, without intermission, a depth of over 1,000ft. was attained.  It\r\nis said (we know not with what truth) that Mr. Parkinson and his agent\r\nwere induced to go on with the boring to this extent, because the men\r\nbrought up in their pockets fragments of coal (which they had of course\r\nthemselves taken down), and the hopes of success were thus buoyed up.\r\nWhen, however, this depth of 1,000ft. had been attained, and no vein of\r\ncoal discovered, the unfortunate proprietor was compelled, from lack of\r\nfunds, to abandon the enterprise.  The boring to such a depth was, of\r\ncourse, a work extending over a lengthy period, and the occasional\r\nexhibition of these fragments of coal by the labourers led to false\r\nreports of success being periodically circulated.  It is said that there\r\nwere frequent scenes of great excitement at Mr. Parkinson’s residence;\r\npersons of all classes, even the poor, flocking thither to lend their\r\nmoney to him on the bare security of his notes of hand, hoping themselves\r\nto derive a large profit from the expected mine.  On one occasion the\r\nbells of Horncastle Parish Church were rung in the night, announcing the\r\njoyful tidings that coal had been found.  But, alas! all these hopes were\r\nillusory.  Mr. Parkinson himself became a ruined man, and many a poor\r\ninvestor lost his all, sunk in the mine.  The attempt thus proving\r\nabortive, the mine was closed, and remained so for several years, Mr.\r\nParkinson himself disappearing from the scene, and his Woodhall property\r\npassing into other hands—the ancestors of the present owners of the\r\nestate.  As the result of this collapse, other portions of Mr.\r\nParkinson’s property in the neighbourhood also changed hands.  Mr.\r\nOstler, who has been already mentioned, had advanced to him large sums of\r\nmoney, and in lieu of repayment he acquired the “Forest,” since in\r\nconsequence (as I have said) called “the Ostler Plantations,” and which\r\nstill remains the property of his representatives.\r\n\r\nDuring the making of the shaft a serious accident occurred.  Two men were\r\nbelow in the shaft working at the bore, a man being at the top to hoist\r\nthem, by machinery, to the surface, to be out of danger whenever, in the\r\nprocess of boring, an explosion was about to take place.  They had\r\narranged their explosive for a blast, had lighted the fuse, and then gave\r\nthe signal to be hoisted up; but the man at the mouth of the mine had\r\ngone to sleep, their signal was disregarded, and they were left unable to\r\nhelp themselves.  The explosion took place; one of them, William East by\r\nname, was killed, and his body much mangled; the other man, Tyler, was\r\nseriously injured, but escaped with his life. {8a}\r\n\r\nA poem was written on the occasion by Mr. John Sharpe, of Kirkstead, {8b}\r\nwhich I here give.  The rural muse was somewhat unclassical in those\r\ndays, and versions vary, but it was in the main as follows:—\r\n\r\n    It was early one morning, the 15th of June,\r\n    I was called from my bed by a sorrowful tune;\r\n    With sad lamentations a mother appeared,\r\n    And sad were the tidings I then from her heard. {8c}\r\n    “Our William,” she said, “has been killed in the pit;\r\n    Another is injured, but not dead yet.\r\n    By firing some powder to blow up the stone,\r\n    Poor William was killed, and he died with a groan.”\r\n    I put on my clothes, and I hastened away.\r\n    Till I came to the place where poor William lay.\r\n    He lay on some sacks all covered with gore:\r\n    A sight so distressing, I ne’er saw before.\r\n    I inwardly thought, as his wounds were laid bare.\r\n    How many before had been slain in the war. {8d}\r\n    In a moment of time he was summoned away;\r\n    How needful that we, too, should watch and should pray.\r\n    The Lord help us all through our hopes and our fears,\r\n    To live to his praise all our days and years.\r\n\r\nThe pit, once closed, remained so for some years, and there seemed no\r\nprospect of anything but loss accruing from the undertaking.  But\r\nmeanwhile, as time passed on, “Mother Earth” was in labour.  The water in\r\nthe shaft gradually accumulated, eventually reaching the surface, and\r\nthen overflowed, running down an adjoining ditch, which skirted what is\r\nnow called “Coal-pit Wood.”  This overflow naturally attracted attention.\r\nSuch things as “Spas” were not unknown.  There was one at Lincoln, not\r\nfar from the present Arboretum, and the Woodhall water being found to be\r\n_salt_, as was said, like sea water, several persons tried it for\r\ndifferent purposes.  A very old man (living, in 1899, at Kirkby-on-Bain)\r\n{9a} states that he and several others in that parish used the water as a\r\npurgative (a property which it still retains).  Others used it as\r\nincreasing the appetite (one of the effects still remarked).  Joseph\r\nEast, lately resident at Kirkstead, and brother of the man killed in the\r\npit, was sent, as a boy, to get a bottle of it to administer to a sick\r\nhorse.  The Squire, Mr. T. Hotchkin, found it very beneficial for his\r\ngout, and the servant, who brought the water for him, mentioned this to a\r\nwoman at Horsington, named Coo, suffering from rheumatism.  By the advice\r\nof her doctor, she tried the water, and was completely cured.  In\r\nOctober, 1903, died Mrs. Wilson, mother of Robert Wilson, gardener, of\r\nMartin Dales, aged 92.  She was the oldest patient then living who had\r\nbaths at Woodhall before the first bath-house was built.  There was only\r\na wooden bath, at a charge of 1s. per bath.  Many similar {9b} cases are\r\nrecorded by the older inhabitants, which proved beyond doubt the efficacy\r\nof the water in the ailments of man and beast, especially for rheumatism\r\nand skin diseases.\r\n\r\nThis led to the re-opening of the mine shaft about the year 1824.  In\r\n1829, or 1830, a small protecting structure was erected, a windlass was\r\nput up, which was worked by a horse walking round and round, drawing the\r\nwater from “the well,” as it came now to be termed, and an open brick\r\ntank was constructed in which the poor could dip, a veritable modern\r\nSiloam. {9c}\r\n\r\nIn 1834 a bath house was erected by the late Thomas Hotchkin, Esq., the\r\nthen owner of Woodhall, and in the following year the Victoria Hotel was\r\nbuilt by him, his whole outlay amounting to some £30,000.  Provision was\r\nthus made for the reception of visitors, and the treatment of their\r\nailments on a scale more than adequate for the public requirements at the\r\ntime.  Dr. Barton, Dr. Scott, and other medical practitioners\r\nsuccessively resided at the Spa, but for some years longer (as will be\r\nshewn in the next chapter) the difficulty of access prevented any great\r\ninflux of patients, such as we have seen in more recent times, and a\r\nprimitive state of things still prevailed, such as in these days can be\r\nhardly realised, and Woodhall Spa was probably for some years little\r\nknown beyond the neighbourhood, or the county.\r\n\r\nAbout sixty years ago a second well (remembered only as little more than\r\na floating, vague tradition) was sunk on other property, not far from the\r\npresent Mill-lane, near Kirkstead Station.  A solitary survivor of the\r\nworkmen engaged in sinking it died in 1897, well known to the writer.\r\nThis well was subsequently filled in again, the water being (as was said)\r\ntoo _salt_ for use.  It is more probable that the water tasted strongly\r\nof iron, as the local water, found within a few feet of the surface, is\r\ngenerally impregnated with this ingredient, so much so, that it commonly\r\n“ferrs” water bottles if allowed to stand any time in them, this being\r\nthe effect of its ferruginous properties.\r\n\r\nAn account of the well would hardly be complete without some particulars,\r\nso far as they can be obtained, of the geological strata which were\r\npierced by the shaft.  These are said to have been gravel and boulder\r\nclay, Kimmeridge and Oxford clays, Kelloway’s rock, blue clay, cornbrash,\r\nlimestone, great oolite, clay and limestone, upper Estuarine clay,\r\nLincolnshire oolite, and Northampton sands, Lias, upper, middle, and part\r\nof lower.\r\n\r\nOf the chemical ingredients of the water, as several accounts have been\r\ngiven by different authorities, it is sufficient to say here that its two\r\nmost important elements are the iodine and bromine, in both of which it\r\nfar exceeds any other Spa.  The only known water which contains a greater\r\nproportion of bromine is that of the Dead Sea, in Palestine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.  LOCAL RECORDS OP THE PAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo those who visit Woodhall Spa, in its present advanced and advancing\r\ncondition, it must be difficult to conceive the very different condition\r\nof the locality even in the middle of the 19th century.  If the Victorian\r\nera has been a period of remarkable progress, nowhere has it been more so\r\nthan at Woodhall Spa.  The place was, in those days, only accessible with\r\ngreat difficulty.  The roads, scarcely indeed worthy of the name, were so\r\nbad that the writer well remembers going there, as a boy, with his\r\nfather, for the first time, when the ruts were so deep that the pony\r\ncarriage, a four-wheeled vehicle, broke in the middle, and had to be\r\nabandoned by the roadside, and they had to return home to Langton,\r\ndistant about five miles, on foot.  The road (now the Horncastle-road,\r\nand in excellent condition) passed, for a mile or more, over a tract of\r\nsandy moorland, and when the ruts became too deep for traffic on one\r\ntrack, another was adopted, and that, in turn, was abandoned when it\r\nbecame impassable.  It was indeed a veritable Sahara on a small scale.\r\nThe road to Tattershall was fairly good, having probably been an old\r\nRoman highway. {11a}  Such roads are locally called “rampers,” i.e.,\r\nramparts.  The road to “Kirkstead Wharf,” or ferry, where now a fine\r\nbridge spans the river Witham, was also in fairly good condition. {11b}\r\nThe road which now runs from St. Andrew’s Church by the blacksmith’s shop\r\nand Reed’s Beck to Old Woodhall and Langton was just passable with\r\ndifficulty.  A small steam packet plied on the river Witham, between\r\nBoston and Lincoln, calling at Kirkstead twice a day, going and\r\nreturning, and a carrier’s cart from Horncastle struggled through the\r\nsand once a day, each way, in connection with it. {11c}  The condition of\r\nthe road remained but little altered till shortly before the opening of\r\nthe “loop line” of railway between Boston and Lincoln in 1848.  In\r\npreparation for this event the Horncastle-road was put into a fairly good\r\nstate of repair.  In connection with the railway two rival coaches were\r\nrun from the Bull and George Hotels at Horncastle, calling at Woodhall\r\nSpa, en route to Kirkstead Station.  As yet, however, the traffic was\r\nlacking to make the enterprise remunerative.  The brace of coaches were\r\nthen merged in one, but, for the same reason, that arrangement was\r\npresently abandoned, and for some years there remained only the carrier’s\r\ncart, slightly accelerated in speed, and even that was sometimes\r\nprecarious in its journeys.  The writer has found it necessary, on\r\narriving at Kirkstead Station on a dark night, to shoulder his own\r\nportmanteau and carry it himself, for lack of other means of transport,\r\nfrom Kirkstead to Langton, a distance of six miles. {12}  At length, in\r\n1855, the line between Kirkstead and Horncastle, with a station at\r\nWoodhall Spa, was opened, which has proved to be one of the most paying\r\namongst railway ventures in the kingdom, and has opened up communication\r\nbetween Woodhall Spa and all parts of the country.  From these\r\nparticulars it will be seen that, although the whilom owner of the\r\nWoodhall Estate (Mr. Thos. Hotchkin) had spent large sums of money (some\r\n£30,000 it was said) in building the bathhouse and hotel in 1834–5, yet\r\nthe establishment for several years laboured under great disadvantages\r\nowing to its difficulty of access.  Indeed, persons wishing to visit the\r\nSpa from a distance had, for the most part, to bring their own carriages;\r\nor, if arriving by the ordinary means of transit, and wishing to move\r\nbeyond the immediate precincts of the hotel, they had to hire a\r\nconveyance from the Victoria Hotel, where the supply was very limited.\r\nMoreover, in those days some of the lighter kinds of carriage now in\r\nvogue, such as the modern dog-cart, were unknown.  The chaise and the\r\ngig, large or small, were the conveyances in common use, the days not\r\nbeing yet past when the farmer’s wife rode to market on a pillion behind\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nIn matters spiritual there was also a corresponding backwardness.  The\r\nnominal district of Woodhall Spa consisted of outlying portions of the\r\nparishes of Woodhall, Langton, Thornton and Thimbleby, these villages\r\nthemselves being distant from four and a half to seven miles.  A person\r\nstanding in the centre of the cross-roads, near the present Church of St.\r\nAndrew, could have one foot in Langton (his right), the other in Woodhall\r\n(his left) and hold his walking stick before him resting in Thornton.\r\nThe nearest portion of Thimbleby began some 500 yards away northward,\r\nopposite the present blacksmith’s shop.  The portion of Langton extended\r\nfrom St. Andrew’s Church to Mill-lane, near the present Kirkstead\r\nStation.  Thornton extended on the opposite, southern, side of the\r\nKirkstead Wharf-road, from the present station, for a distance of some\r\nmiles eastward, with the parish of Kirkstead running parallel to it on\r\nthe south.  The portion of Woodhall extended eastward from the aforesaid\r\npoint at the cross-roads, and included Woodhall Spa and other land lying\r\nnorth and further east.  In Mill-lane there was (_a_) a Presbyterian\r\nChapel, served by a minister residing at Horncastle, also (_b_) a\r\nWesleyan Chapel on the Kirkstead-road, the minister (a layman) being also\r\nresident in Horncastle.  The only Church of England service in the near\r\nneighbourhood was held at the beautiful little church in the fields,\r\ndistant about a mile to the southwest, being part of the remains of\r\nKirkstead Abbey; but as this benefice was a donative, or “peculiar,” not\r\nunder episcopal jurisdiction, {13} it might be opened or closed, and\r\nstipend paid to a minister or withheld, according to the will of the\r\nproprietor for the time being of the Kirkstead Estate.  The services\r\nhave, therefore, at times been performed somewhat irregularly, and it has\r\nnow been closed since about 1880.  Owing to the distance of the district\r\nfrom the parent parishes and its inaccessibility, the religious interests\r\nof the inhabitants had, at that time, been much neglected.  It was said\r\nthat they lived on a _heath_, and were, many of them, virtually\r\n_heathens_.  And this was in truth only a slight exaggeration, for many\r\nof them attended no place of worship, they rarely were visited by a\r\nminister of any denomination, and many of their children were unbaptized;\r\nand when, a few years later, there was a resident curate, he broke down\r\nunder the weight of his spiritual responsibilities amid such a\r\npopulation.  A change, however, in this respect was effected during the\r\nforties.  The Rev. Edward Walter, Rector of Langton and Vicar of Old\r\nWoodhall, two of the parent parishes, whose name is still held in\r\nreverence among the older inhabitants of Woodhall Spa, took up the\r\nmatter.  He held Church of England services for a time in a room at the\r\nhotel.  He then got together an influential committee, with the\r\nHonourable Sir Henry Dymoke, the Queen’s champion, at their head, {14a}\r\nand they raised a sum of money, to which, among others, the Queen and the\r\nDowager Queen Adelaide {14b} contributed, sufficient at first to erect a\r\nschool and school-house, where the services were temporarily conducted;\r\nand finally for the Church of St. Andrew and the vicarage, which were\r\nerected in 1847, the church being consecrated by Bishop Kaye, of Lincoln,\r\non Sept. 14th in that year.  The architect was Mr. Stephen Lewin, of\r\nBoston, who built several other churches in the neighbourhood, notably\r\nthat of Sausthorpe, near Spilsby, which is a very fine edifice. {14c}\r\n\r\nThe Rev. E. Walter at first endowed the benefice with £20 a year and 30\r\nacres of land, others giving smaller donations.  Subsequently, when some\r\nchurch land was sold in the parent parish of Woodhall, which would have\r\naugmented his own benefice, he conveyed £230 a year to the benefice of\r\nWoodhall Spa; or, as it was then called, Langton St. Andrew, as the\r\nchurch stood on part of Langton Glebe; and this was augmented in 1889 by\r\nhis son, through the sale of land, formerly Langton Glebe, to the extent\r\nof a further £112.  We may fitly add that the Rev. E. Walter rests in the\r\nchurchyard of St. Andrew, the place of his own creation, with the tombs\r\nof other members of his family near his own.  Were a worthy epitaph\r\nneeded, it might well be, _simonumentum quæris circumspice_.  No one, in\r\nhis sphere, has been a greater benefactor to Woodhall Spa.  It should be\r\nadded that a large Wesleyan Chapel was subsequently built; also a\r\nPrimitive Methodist Chapel, and more recently a Roman Catholic Chapel,\r\nwith resident priest.  The various parochial sections were constituted\r\none ecclesiastical district in the year 1854; and in recent years have,\r\nwith some portions of the parishes of Kirkstead and Martin, been made one\r\ncivil parish, with its Urban Council.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1884, the late Stafford Hotchkin, Esq., proprietor of the\r\nWoodhall Estate, expended a considerable sum in re-furnishing the\r\nVictoria Hotel, and making other improvements, in a costly style; and in\r\n1887 the hotel and bathhouse, with about 100 acres of the estate, were\r\npurchased by an influential syndicate, who have since laid out a very\r\ngreat amount in the enlargement of the hotel and grounds, the improvement\r\nof, and additions to, the bathhouse, in supplying expensive automatic\r\nmachinery for the well, and other developments for the convenience or\r\nentertainment of visitors. {15}  This gave a great impetus to the growth\r\nof the place generally.  Another hotel, the “Eagle,” was erected, which\r\nis excellently conducted.  A very large establishment, the Royal Hotel,\r\nwith winter garden, etc., has been built by Mr. Adolphus Came, embracing\r\nan area of 1,000 square yards, covered by a glazed roof, and holding out\r\nmany attractions during the season; while streets of lodging houses,\r\nsemi-detached or single villas, and handsome residences have sprung up in\r\nall directions.  With the growth of the population came a need for\r\nenlarged church accommodation; and the present St. Peter’s Church was\r\nerected by subscription at a cost of over £1,800, and was opened by the\r\nBishop on Sept. 14th, 1893, the foundation stone having been laid in the\r\nprevious year by the Right Honble.  E. Stanhope, M.P., Secretary for War.\r\nIt comprised, at first, only nave and South aisle; in 1904 chancel, organ\r\nchamber and vestry were added, and the church was consecrated by the\r\nBishop on St. Peter’s Day, June 29, in that year; the total cost being\r\nabout £3,700.  There is a fine organ, and peal of tubular bells.  The\r\ninterior fittings are mainly the gifts of generous friends.  The altar\r\nrails and sanctuary carpet were given by Mrs. Randolph Berens, of London,\r\na frequent visitor to the Spa.  The very ornate reredos, occupying the\r\nwhole width of the east end, was presented by Mrs. Cator, of Fairmead\r\nLodge, in memory of her husband, the late Colonel Cator.  It is of oak,\r\nrichly pinnacled and crocketted.  The centre panel contains a basso\r\nrelievo representation of the triple Crucifixion, with the Virgin and St.\r\nJohn in niches on either side.  Above are the emblems of the four\r\nEvangelists.  The buttresses are crowned by the four Archangels, SS.\r\nMichael, Gabriel, Raphael and Uriel.  Over the super-altar is the\r\ninscription, in raised letters, “And I, if I be lifted up, will draw all\r\nmen unto me”; the inscription on the wings being “Ad Majorem, Dei\r\ngloriam, et in piam memoriaun Thomœ Gulielmi Cator, qui in Christo\r\nobdormivit die xiv° Januarii.  A.S.  MDCCCC.”  This is the work of\r\nMessrs. Hems and Sons, of Exeter.  The pulpit, of handsome carved oak,\r\nexecuted by the same artists, was presented by Lieutenant Stafford Vere\r\nHotchkin, of the 21st Lancers Regiment, in memory of his father, the late\r\nT. J. Stafford Hotchkin, lord of the manor.\r\n\r\nOf this church we can only say that all true lovers of architecture must\r\nregret the style in which it was erected.  The original idea, strenuously\r\nadvocated by the late Bishop Suffragan, Dr. E. Trollope, one of our\r\ngreatest authorities (as well as by the present writer, as patron of the\r\nbenefice) was that the Church of St. Andrew should be enlarged by\r\ndoubling the nave and extending the chancel.  Arrangements had been made\r\nto obtain stone for this purpose from the ruins of Stixwold Priory, of\r\nwhich that church was originally built.  A suitable edifice would thus\r\nhave been erected, in a central position.  Unfortunately the Bishop died\r\nwhile the question was yet _sub judice_, and, as most persons of taste\r\nmust feel, counsels less wise prevailed.  The present structure of brick\r\nhas been called a barn; it is of no architectural pretensions; the\r\ntracery of the windows is of the most meagre description.  The ground\r\naround it is too limited to be used for burial, although the churchyard\r\nof St. Andrew is rapidly filling, and at no distant date a cemetery must\r\nbe provided.\r\n\r\nThe writer, while incumbent of Woodhall Spa, in conjunction with Mr. R.\r\nCuffe, M.R.C.S., then lessee of the Victoria Hotel, commenced, in 1873, a\r\nCottage Hospital for the poor, on a small scale, which was largely\r\nbeneficial, patients being admitted almost literally from Land’s End to\r\nJohn o’Groats’ house.  Some left their crutches behind them, nailed to\r\nthe walls of the bathhouse; and it may be added, as shewing the efficacy\r\nof the water, that cases occurred of patients who, on their arrival,\r\ncould only get about painfully on crutches, but who yet, before leaving,\r\nran in foot races at the village sports.  The cottage then rented has of\r\nlate years been superseded by the much larger Alexandra Hospital, a\r\nsubstantial building, under the patronage of the Princess of Wales,\r\nerected through the exertions of the Rev. J. O. Stephens, rector of\r\nBlankney, on a site presented by the syndicate.  It was opened in 1890,\r\nand has conferred large benefits on the suffering poor.  The medical\r\nofficer is Dr. Williams, L.R.C.P., Ed., Brookside Cottage, by whom\r\npatients are treated with great skill.  He has published a pamphlet on\r\nthe Woodhall water and treatment.  He is ably assisted by Mr. H. W. Gwyn,\r\nL.S.A.  A pamphlet on the same subject was also published by the late Mr.\r\nA. E. Boulton, M.R.C.S., Horncastle.  Mr. R. Cuffe, M.R.C.S.,\r\nSurgeon-Major, has also a large residence, the Northcote House\r\nSanatorium, for the reception of high-class patients, who are under his\r\nown supervision.  He has had a large and long experience in every variety\r\nof ailment for which the Woodhall treatment is adapted, having been sole\r\nlessee of the Spa establishment from 1866 to 1883; he has written much on\r\nthe subject; was himself mainly instrumental in founding the British\r\nBalneological and Climatological Society, which has as its members the\r\nleading physicians of the chief watering places in the kingdom; and at\r\nhis hands patients receive the most scientific treatment, he having been\r\nthe first to introduce, many years ago, the electrolytic treatment, so\r\neffective in internal cases.\r\n\r\nA “Home for Gentlewomen,” in reduced circumstances, and needing the\r\nWoodhall treatment, was established in 1894 by the present writer, in\r\nco-operation with Mr. Cuffe, as hon. medical officer.  It is under the\r\npatronage of his Grace the Duke of Rutland, and other distinguished\r\npersons.  It was at first located in two bungalows, but now occupies a\r\nroomy residence on the Horncastle-road.  It has been very generously\r\nsupported, and has proved a great boon in many needy cases.\r\n\r\nThe annals of the Woodhall neighbourhood are not without their tragic\r\nfeatures; and deeds of lawlessness have occurred equal to anything of the\r\nkind recorded in modern times.\r\n\r\nOn June 22nd, in the year 1822, a young man named Stennet Jeffrey was\r\nreturning from Horncastle Fair to the farm of his employer, Mr. Warrener\r\n(still occupied by members of the same family), when, as he was passing\r\nalong the footpath through a part of Whitehall Wood, called “the\r\nWilderness,” he was attacked by, as was supposed at the time, two men\r\nagainst whom he had given information of their poaching.  They were\r\naccompanied by a female named Sophy Motley, still remembered by some of\r\nmy informants as a big, masculine woman.  After a desperate struggle for\r\nhis life, a track being trampled down round the tree, by which he tried\r\nto elude them (the grass, as tradition says, never growing again\r\nafterwards), he was overpowered and foully done to death.  His body was\r\nfound thrown into the ditch near at hand, with the throat cut.  They\r\ncarried off his watch, which he had bought at the fair that day, and his\r\nmoney.  A sovereign was found near the spot a few years afterwards by a\r\nman who was ploughing in the adjoining field.  The present writer\r\nremembers being told in after years, by a man living at Woodhall, who was\r\nat the time working in a field not far off, that he heard cries for help,\r\nbut did not know what they meant, and so the poor fellow was left to\r\nstruggle unaided in the unequal conflict.  The tree has been seen by the\r\nwriter, round which he tried to escape.  It stood at the south-west end\r\nof the path through the wood, about two miles from Woodhall Spa, and was\r\ninscribed with the rudely-cut names of many a visitor to the spot.  The\r\nparties to the murder were supposed to have come from Coningsby Moor, and\r\nthis was confirmed by the fact that they afterwards stopped for\r\nrefreshment at a small public house kept by Mrs. Copping, at Fulsby,\r\nwhich lay in the direction of Coningsby Moor.  Near there some\r\nbloodstained clothes were found concealed in a hedge.  A reward of £100\r\nwas offered for their apprehension.  The woman Copping, at the\r\npublic-house, was, it is said, fully aware of their guilt, but dared not\r\nsay anything about it.  The two men were convicted, and transported for\r\nlife.  The woman Motley was arrested on suspicion, but there was not\r\nsufficient evidence to convict her.  In after years a man at Coningsby,\r\nnamed Paul Tomline, confessed on his deathbed that he had been a third\r\nparty to the murder, having assisted in holding Jeffrey down while his\r\nthroat was being cut.  It is further stated that the woman, Sophy Motley,\r\non her deathbed, said that the stolen watch would be found at the bottom\r\nof her box.\r\n\r\nIn the forties and fifties poaching was carried on in so openly defiant a\r\nmanner, and on so formidable a scale, as is seldom heard of in these\r\ndays.  The writer was a party concerned in the following incident, not,\r\nbe it said, in the immediate neighbourhood of Woodhall, although within\r\neasy reach of it.  While he was visiting a worthy baronet for the purpose\r\nof shooting with him, they were informed by the head-keeper, as they met\r\nhim one morning after breakfast, that he had received a private\r\nintimation that a gang of poachers, living in a neighbouring town, had\r\nchartered a special train to bring them down, on the following evening,\r\nto shoot some of the preserves, the line of railway skirting the\r\nproperty.  We at once decided to give them a warm reception.  This was\r\nnot an entirely new thing for which we were unprepared, and the keeper\r\nhad a most powerful mastiff, a monster Cerberus, who could plant his\r\nforepaws on the stoutest man’s shoulders and pull him down.  The\r\nbaronet’s only son, the writer’s great friend, with whom he had walked\r\nmany a league in the Alps, and many a mile—with its “bittock”—over the\r\nScotch moors, was “keen for the fray.”  No less so was the writer.  As\r\nthe estate comprised three parishes, and it was not known at what point\r\nthe poachers would “detrain,” it was evident that we should have an\r\nextended frontier to protect, and it was decided at once to despatch a\r\nmessenger to the owner of an adjoining estate, the M.P. for the Division,\r\nasking for the loan of his keepers, to co-operate with our own.  Watchers\r\nwere to be sent to various points, swift-footed vedettes, to come into\r\nimmediate touch with the enemy on their arrival, and to report the\r\ndirection taken by them, and their number.  Everything was arranged in\r\ngood time before the morning was over.  It was settled that the keeper\r\nwas to come to the hall at 9 p.m., when the son and the writer would be\r\nready to join them.  We were none of us to take firearms, but to be\r\nfurnished with stout sticks.  The evening passed slowly, in our eagerness\r\nfor the “joust.”  But at nine o’clock the keeper came with a look of\r\ndisappointment on his countenance.  News had got abroad of the\r\npreparations we had made for the gang’s reception; an ally, lurking near,\r\nhad telegraphed that it would not be safe for them to venture on their\r\nraid, and the train had been countermanded.  Since then the genial\r\nbaronet has “crossed the bar,” as a Lincolnshire poet hath it; but of\r\nlate the writer has had the pleasure, almost annually, of meeting her\r\nladyship at Woodhall Spa.  She was brought up in a parish closely\r\nconnected with Woodhall, and she may almost be said to return to her\r\n“native heath” to renew her years.\r\n\r\nThe reader will please excuse this digression, as it illustrates the\r\ncondition of things under which occurred the incident of local history\r\nwhich I am now about to give.\r\n\r\nA no less atrocious murder than that in the Wilderness was committed,\r\nwithin less than a mile of the same place, at Well-Syke Wood, which again\r\nis about two miles from Woodhall Spa.  The shooting of the wood belonged\r\nto the Rev. John Dymoke, afterwards the champion, who rented it from Lord\r\nFortescue.  In the year 1850, the head keeper, Richard Tasker, received a\r\nwritten intimation that a gang of poachers intended to visit the wood on\r\na certain night, and the writer of the letter recommended him, for his\r\nown sake, to keep away.  Tasker, however, was lodging not far from the\r\nwood, with a small farmer named Emanuel Howden, who also occasionally\r\nacted as a watchman; and the two men, accompanied by the “rabbiter,”\r\nJames Donner, went to the wood, to protect their master’s pheasants.\r\nHowden hung back, not liking the undertaking; Donner went off to watch\r\nthe wood from another point.  Presently a shot was heard, and on Howden\r\nand Donner coming to Tasker, they found him lying on the ground severely\r\nwounded, and he died the following day.  It was a bright moonlight night,\r\n{21a} and Donner tried, for a time, to follow the poachers, but they\r\neluded him.  This occurred in a field just outside Well-Syke Wood, at the\r\nnorth-west corner, then occupied by William Hutchinson, grandfather of\r\nthe present tenant, whose house adjoins the Horncastle-road, some two\r\nmiles from Woodhall Spa.  Most of the poachers were believed to have come\r\nfrom Horsington; two of them, brothers, named Bowring, and a third,\r\nPearson Clarke, and another named Hinds; a man named Stennet was also\r\narrested on suspicion; but they were all eventually discharged, there\r\nbeing no means of identifying them, as the murdered man was the only one\r\nwho came to close quarters with any of them.  Along with these, it is\r\nbelieved there was also a man named Joseph Kent, from Tattershall Thorpe,\r\nwho is supposed to have fired the fatal shot.  As Tasker approached the\r\nwood, this man came forward and recommended him to go home.  Tasker\r\ncalled out that he was not yet going home, and that he knew him,\r\nwhereupon Kent, finding that he was recognised, fined the shot. {21b}\r\n\r\nThe following is a less exciting incident.  A few years later a man,\r\nrepresenting himself as a beggar, called at Kirkstead Hall, about a mile\r\nfrom Woodhall Spa, asking for relief.  Something was given to him, but it\r\nnot being sufficient to satisfy his desires, he indulged in threatening\r\nlanguage, unless he was treated more liberally.  At length he became so\r\nviolent that the door was closed in his face, and he was told that they\r\nwould fetch the constable, whereupon he went off.  The female inmates,\r\nbeing afraid that he might return, if they were left alone, thought it\r\nsafest to send for the constable, and he, with the keeper, followed the\r\nman and apprehended him.  He was handcuffed, his feet tightly tied\r\ntogether, and put by them into a cart, in which the constable, without\r\nthe keeper, drove off to Horncastle, to place him in the lock-up, then\r\ncalled “The Round House.”  As they journeyed on their way, near the\r\n“Tower on the Moor,” the man, lying at the bottom of the cart, complained\r\nto the constable that the cords on his legs were cutting into the flesh;\r\n“Would he take them off?” adding that the handcuffs secured him fast\r\nenough.  The constable accordingly got down from his seat, and took off\r\nthe cords.  As he was remounting, the man slipt out of the cart behind,\r\nand, bounding off into the wood, “Ostler’s Plantations,” close by,\r\nturned, as he mounted the boundary bank, defying the constable to follow\r\nhim.  The latter could not leave his horse, and, the man being very\r\npowerfully built, he also knew that he was more than a match for him\r\nsingle handed.  The man disappeared.  Some one coming up assisted the\r\nconstable to tie up his horse and make a search for the prisoner; but all\r\nthey found were the handcuffs, which he had wrenched off, lying inside\r\nthe wood not far away.  Two present inhabitants of Woodhall saw the\r\nconstable pass their house, driving the cart with the man lying in it.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable burglary was committed about two miles from Woodhall\r\nSpa on February 2nd, 1829, at Halstead Hall, a fine specimen of a “Moated\r\nGrange,” to which reference will be made in another chapter.  It was at\r\nthat time occupied by a farmer, Mr. Wm. Elsey, his wife, and farm\r\nservants.  At eight o’clock in the evening, when the servant men went out\r\nto “supper up” the horses, they were attacked by seven or eight men,\r\nthrown down, their legs tied, and their hands secured behind their backs,\r\nand each was left in a separate stall.  The stable door was then locked,\r\nand one of the gang remained outside on guard.  The burglars then\r\nproceeded to the hall, and knocked at the back door.  One of the servant\r\ngirls asked who was there.  She received the reply, “Open the door,\r\nBetty.”  She did so, whereupon four or five men rushed into the kitchen.\r\nOne of the maids escaped, and ran to the room where Mr. and Mrs. Elsey\r\nwere sitting.  Mr. Elsey was smoking his pipe, and Mrs. Elsey was\r\npreparing something for supper.  She saved her silver spoon, which she\r\nwas using, by slipping it into her bosom.  Mr. Elsey seized the poker to\r\ndefend himself, but, on seeing their number, prudently laid it down.\r\nThey then rifled his pockets and took his watch and money; also making\r\nMrs. Elsey turn her pockets out.  They then obliged the two to go into a\r\nsmall storeroom or closet, locked the door, and tied a hay fork across\r\nit.  They then collected all the plate, to the value of £30, and £50 in\r\ncash; having first regaled themselves with a hearty meal.  They also took\r\nall the silk handkerchiefs which they could find.  Mrs. Elsey, in her\r\nconfinement close by, complained to the burglars that she was very cold,\r\nand begged them to let her warm herself at the fire; accordingly, with\r\nthe gallantry of a Dick Turpin, one of them brought her out, but seeing\r\nthat she was noticing them, he ordered her into the store-room again,\r\ngiving her, however, some greatcoats which were hanging in the passage\r\nnear.  When they had ransacked everything within reach, they compelled\r\nMr. Elsey to go upstairs, one walking before him and another behind, each\r\nholding a pistol, and telling him that if he made any resistance he would\r\nbe shot.  They then, in the same fashion, obliged Mrs. Elsey to go up\r\nafter him.  The two were then locked up again, and the marauders politely\r\nwished them goodnight, and went off with their plunder, saying that if\r\nany alarm was given they would return.  Mr. Elsey, about two hours\r\nafterwards, by the help of a small hammer and an old knife, succeeded in\r\nmaking a small hole through the brick wall of the closet, through which\r\none of the maids was able to thrust her arm, and set them at liberty.\r\nThe only article recovered was a plated silver teapot, which was found in\r\nHalstead Wood, near at hand.  Outside this wood ran a bridle path leading\r\ntowards Woodhall Spa, and in the course of the night the inmates of a\r\nfarmhouse, standing close to this path, were disturbed by the voices of\r\nmen passing by toward “the Spa.”  One of these men was soon captured, and\r\nin due course hanged at Lincoln Castle on March 27th following; two more\r\nwere taken that year, and hanged on March 19th in the next year, 1830.\r\nOf these two, one was known as “Tippler,” the other as “Tiger Tom.”\r\n“Tiger Tom” had been the terror of the neighbourhood, and the general\r\nopinion was that no one could take him.  But two powerfully built and\r\nfearless men, David English, of Hameringham, and a gamekeeper named\r\nBullivant, were set to accomplish the task, and they succeeded in running\r\ntheir man to ground, and securing him at “The Bungalow,” a public-house\r\non the Witham, near Boston. {24}  With them was hanged another noted\r\ncharacter known as “Bill” Clarke, convicted of sheep-stealing.  His was\r\nthe last case of hanging for that offence.  The last of the gang was not\r\ncaptured till two years later.  He was the one who had planned the whole\r\naffair, having formerly been a servant of Mr. Elsey, and therefore well\r\nacquainted with the premises at the Hall.  He, however, escaped hanging,\r\nbeing transported for life, as the excitement over the affair had by that\r\ntime cooled down; and, further, it was pleaded in his favour, that he had\r\nprevented a bad character among them, named Timothy Brammar, from\r\nshooting Mr. Elsey, or ill-treating the maids.  Of this same Timothy\r\nBrammar it is recorded that his own mother having foretold that he would\r\n“die in his shoes,” he carefully kicked them off as he stood on the\r\nscaffold, to falsify the prediction.  It is further stated that the man\r\ntransported was, with two other criminals sent out at the same time,\r\nthrown overboard, as the three were caught trying to sink the vessel in\r\nwhich they were being conveyed “beyond the seas.”  These men, with the\r\nexception of this former servant of Mr. Elsey, were all “bankers,” as\r\nthey were then called, _i.e._, navvies; and such men in those days were\r\nusually a very truculent class.  A robbery of a minor kind was cleverly\r\nfrustrated in Woodhall about the year 1850.  A labourer’s wife, residing\r\nat a cottage on what is now called “Redcap Farm,” had been taking her\r\nhusband’s dinner to him in the fields.  On returning, rather earlier than\r\nusual, she went to the bedroom upstairs.  While in the room she detected\r\nthe legs of a man, who had concealed himself under the bed.  Retaining\r\nher presence of mind, she merely made a trifling remark to her cat, and\r\nwent down again, and for some minutes made a noise, as though busying\r\nherself about her usual household work.  She presently got out of the\r\nhouse, and ran to some men working near.  The thief thinking, by her cool\r\nbehaviour, that she had not noticed him, remained still in his place of\r\nconcealment; and she quickly returned, accompanied by two men, who\r\ncaptured him; when he was found to be a well-known thief, who had been\r\nconvicted more than once of similar offences.  Not far from the scene of\r\nthis occurrence, another attempted robbery was frustrated.  An aged\r\ncouple lived in a solitary house, distant from any high road, near the\r\nwood called “Edlington Scrubs.”  After they had gone to rest a couple of\r\nmen broke into the house.  Hearing a disturbance, the wife opened the one\r\nbedroom door upstairs, connected with the room below by a “Jacob’s\r\nladder,” and looked down through the trap door at the ladder head, with a\r\n“dip” in her hand, to see the cause of the disturbance.  She was\r\nimmediately accosted with the demand, “Your money, or your life.”  She\r\nreplied, very deliberately, “Well, life is not worth having without the\r\nmoney.”  One of the men began mounting the ladder, but meanwhile the\r\nhusband had armed himself with a strong bill-hook, a tool for cutting\r\nhedges; he took his place by the trap door, and said to the burglar on\r\nthe ladder, “I shall cut your head off if you come up here.”  This\r\nposition he maintained, moving his weapon backwards and forwards over the\r\ntrap door, his figure being revealed to the thieves by the light of his\r\nwife’s dip, until day began to break, when, to avoid being recognised,\r\nthey went off, having to content themselves with what spoil the second\r\nman could find in the room below.  On another occasion, a narrow escape\r\nfrom highway robbery occurred in Woodhall under the following\r\ncircumstances.  It was at the time of the great August Fair at\r\nHorncastle, much larger at that time (in the forties) than it is at the\r\npresent day; for it then lasted some three weeks.  That fair has been the\r\noccasion of many robberies, and more than one murder.  Skeletons have\r\nbeen found buried under the brick floors of public-houses in the town,\r\nbeing doubtless all that remained of those who had fallen the victims of\r\nthe “sacra fames auri.”  The principal farmer in Woodhall was riding home\r\nleisurely from the fair late in the evening, when at a point in the road\r\nbetween Langton and Woodhall, about two fields from Old Woodhall Church,\r\nwhere a cartshed then stood contiguous to the road, two men rushed out\r\nfrom the concealment of the shed and seized his bridle.  One of them told\r\nhim roughly to give up his money, or he would pistol him.  The other held\r\nup a lantern to his face, and then said, “Oh, you’re not the man we want;\r\nyou may go, and think yourself lucky.”  The farmer in question was not\r\nmuch of a horse-dealer, and would not be likely to have much money about\r\nhim.  The man really wanted was a well-known character, then living at\r\nStixwould, by name Grantham, who would be almost certain to be going home\r\nwith pockets fairly full, as he dealt largely in horse-flesh, and the men\r\nhad probably seen him make a good bargain or two in the fair that day.\r\nThe farmer, thus set at liberty, hurried to his home, only two fields\r\ndistant; and, having a shrewd guess for whom they were lying in wait, he\r\nsent an active young fellow by a short cut across the fields to warn\r\nGrantham.  The lad succeeded in intercepting the latter before he arrived\r\nat the point of danger; and Grantham, turning his horse round, rode home\r\nby another route, through Thimbleby, instead of Woodhall, and arrived at\r\nhis house in safety, thanks to the thoughtfulness of a neighbour.\r\n\r\nThere are some good historic names among the older residents of the\r\nWoodhall Spa district.  Howard is one, a name, which still stands high in\r\nthe peerage of England.  Gaunt is another frequent name; some of the\r\nmembers of the family, in the fine build of their bodily frame and their\r\ndark hair and complexion, seeming to indicate descent from ancient Norman\r\nblood.  Fynes, or more properly Fiennes, is another; implying a\r\nconnection with the Ducal House of Newcastle; the father of the present\r\ngeneration (a former tenant of the writer) having been named Charles\r\nPelham Fynes.  Monuments of the Fiennes family are common in neighbouring\r\nparishes, and they still hold considerable property in the surrounding\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.  NATURE NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great charm of Woodhall Spa is its “Rus in Urbe” character.  The\r\nvisitor can hardly go for ten minutes in any direction from his hotel or\r\nlodgings but he finds himself by the woodside, among the hedgerows or on\r\nthe heath, where the jaded spirit, or the enfeebled frame, may draw fresh\r\nenergy from the bracing air, richly charged with ozone, and even at times\r\nperceptibly impregnated with the tonic flavour of the iodine.  The author\r\nof a recent publication who visited Woodhall Spa, in 1897, says:\r\n“Woodhall is as unlike the usual run of fashionable watering places as\r\none can well imagine.  It is a charming health resort—situated on a dry,\r\nsandy soil, where fir trees flourish—there are wild moors, purple with\r\nheather, and aglow with golden gorse; a land of health, and the air\r\ndeliciously bracing.  I do not think (he adds) there is a purer or more\r\nexhilarating air to be found in all England, or for that matter out of\r\nit.” {27a}\r\n\r\nOf the surrounding scenery it need hardly be said that we are not in the\r\nland of “the mountain,” though we have the “brown heath, and shaggy\r\nwood,” and occasionally, not far off, “the flood,” sung of by Scotia’s\r\nbard.  But within sight are the Wolds, whose precipitous sides have, to\r\nmy knowledge, astonished strangers, who, judging from the country\r\ntraversed by the railway from Peterborough, expected to find the whole\r\ncounty as level as a billiard table. {27b}  The flatness of the country,\r\nhowever, is amply made up for by other redeeming features.  Within a mile\r\nof the Spa a view is obtained stretching more than 20 miles, with the\r\ngrand Cathedral (which Ruskin says is “worth any two others in the\r\nkingdom”) crowning the “steep” hill of Lincoln on the horizon.  “’Tis\r\ndistance lends enchantment to the view,” says the poet Campbell; and this\r\nprospect, slightly undulating, with extensive woods barring it at\r\nintervals, and village spires rising from their midst, seen through the\r\nmarvellously clear atmosphere which we often enjoy, is a sight worth\r\nseeing.\r\n\r\nAn old writer {27c} describes the air as being “crass, and full of rotten\r\nharrs”; and Drayton, in his “Polyolbion” {28a} speaks of the “unwholesome\r\nayre, and more unwholesome soyle”; but that condition of things has long\r\nago passed away.  Another charming effect of these distant prospects is\r\nthe glorious sunsets.  Kingsley, in his “Hereward the Wake,” truly says,\r\nthe “vastness gives such cloudlands, such sunrises, such sunsets, as can\r\nbe seen nowhere else in these isles.”  A writer, whom I have already\r\nquoted, says, “I am inclined to think the sky scenery, if I may be\r\nallowed the term, the finest and most wonderful in the world.”  As to\r\n“its gorgeous sunsets, you look upon an atmosphere saturated with colour,\r\nso that it becomes opalesque; and the sinking sun, seen through the\r\nvibrating air, is magnificent.  From the slopes of far California I have\r\nlooked down upon the sun dipping into the wide Pacific, amid a riot of\r\ncolour, but nothing like this.” {28b}  Nor is this any exaggeration.  The\r\nvisitor to Woodhall may see it for himself, and the writer has often\r\ngazed upon it.  Towards evening the soft blue of the distance becomes\r\ngradually lit up by the lowering sun with the most gorgeous and varied\r\nshades of purple, gold, and ruby, until he sinks below the horizon in a\r\nblaze of crimson glory.  Then follow, softer, more mellowed tints of\r\nviolet, pink, emerald green, exquisite greys, and varying hues of the\r\nmost delicate kinds, until they slowly fade away into the shades of\r\nnight, or the silvery sheen of the moon.\r\n\r\nFor the student of nature, there are special attractions in the botany of\r\nthe neighbourhood; scarcely less in its ornithology.  The wild,\r\nfour-footed creatures also are in unusual variety; and within easy reach\r\nthe antiquarian will find objects of very special interest.\r\n\r\nIn these pages it would be impossible to treat of all these subjects\r\nfully.\r\n\r\nI will take botany first.  And I would here make the preliminary\r\nobservation, that, in specifying different plants to be found in the near\r\nvicinity, I shall not indicate exactly the _habitat_ of each, for the\r\nsake of preserving to Woodhall Spa in the future some of its choicest\r\nattractions.  The track of the invading tourist is too often marked by\r\nmassacre.  A French ambassador, describing some years ago the country\r\nlife of our gentry, said that one of the first proposals, made after\r\nbreakfast by the host, would be, “Let us go out and kill something”; and\r\nthis national tendency has disastrously affected our Flora as well as our\r\nFauna.  A writer has said, “There is a base sort of botanist who prods up\r\nchoice treasures wantonly to destroy them.  They are murderers, to be\r\nclassed with those who have stamped the quagga out of Africa, or those\r\nwho fly to firearms if Nature sends a rare migrant creature of air, or\r\nearth, or water, in their way.”  Go through our English lakes, as the\r\nwriter did recently, after not having visited them for several years, and\r\nyou will find, for instance, the falls of Lodore, where once the\r\nparsley-fern abounded, now entirely stript of it.  Just as—to take a\r\nparallel case—in a certain stream in Borrowdale, where some years ago the\r\nwriter caught so many trout that the widow, in whose cottage he lodged,\r\noffered to keep him any length of time gratis, so long as he would supply\r\nher with fish at the same rate; now, in that stream hardly a fish is to\r\nbe caught, from its so constantly being “flogged” by the tourist.  The\r\nsame holds good, though, so far, in a less degree, at Woodhall.\r\n“Ichabod” may be writ in large characters over the record of some of the\r\nplants once plentiful.  I shall, therefore, leave the botanist, with few\r\nexceptions, to hunt out the specimens for himself, only stating that they\r\nexist.  But is not this, after all, the chief charm of his pursuit to the\r\ntrue lover of Nature?  To have everything found to hand for him may\r\nindeed lessen his labours, but it robs him of all the gratification with\r\nwhich he can exclaim “Eureka,” as his eyes rest upon the long-sought\r\nprize which he has found for himself.  The difference between the true\r\nbotanist and the sportsman has been thus defined: “The sportsman seeks to\r\nkill; the botanist seeks to find, to admire, and to preserve.”  Would\r\nthat it were always so.  From the great difference in the soils in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, varying from the lightest sand to the stiffest\r\nclay, or from the peat and bog of the fen to the gravel of the moor, or\r\nthe leafy mould of the wood, there is also a very great variety of wild\r\nplants.  The late Rev. R. H. Webb, author of “The Botany of Herts,” was\r\nsome years ago a frequent visitor at Woodhall Spa, and he assured the\r\nwriter, that in all his experience he had never known so large or so\r\ninteresting a variety as was to be found in this neighbourhood.  On one\r\noccasion the writer, collecting wild plants for a flower show, gathered,\r\nin the course of a morning’s walk, more than 110 different specimens.\r\nProbably the rarest plant was the Silene Quinque vulneralis, the\r\ndiscovery of which led to a lengthy correspondence, it being rarely found\r\nin England, though fairly common in Jersey.  It was growing in a field\r\nwhich now forms part of the garden of the Victoria Hotel.  The\r\nalterations necessary to make that transformation extinguished it, or\r\nrather buried it out of sight; but as some correspondents gave instances\r\nwhere it had recurred in localities in which it had for years been\r\nunknown, there is no absolute reason why it should not also reappear in\r\nthis case.  Should it do so, we can only cry, _parce_, _precor_, to the\r\ntoo ruthless collector.  The Osmunda Regalis, again, a few years ago was\r\nvery plentiful; the writer has had plants of it which grew to be three,\r\nfour, and even five feet in height, but it is now quite extinct.  Not\r\nonly so, but the writer, finding this to be the case, replanted some\r\nroots of it in 1897, where he fondly hoped they would escape observation,\r\nbut, on going to look for them the following year, he found the soil dug\r\nup all round the place by the trespassing marauder, and not a trace of\r\nthem was left.\r\n\r\nThe following plants have been mentioned by different authorities as\r\namong those which are be found.  The Rev. E. Adrian Woodruffe Peacock,\r\nsecretary to the Lincolnshire Naturalists’ Union, says: “We may expect to\r\nfind some of the following rare plants—Ranunculus Hederaceus, Corydalis\r\nclaviculata, Raphanus Raphanistrum, Silene Quinque-Vulnera (most rare),\r\nSilene Anglica (not so rare), Vicia Bobartii, Cotyledon Umbilicus, Sedum\r\nVillosum, Sedum Reflexum, Drosera Anglica, Epilobium Tetragonum,\r\nCampanula Ranunculoides.  At a meeting of the Alford Naturalists’ Society\r\nthe secretary exhibited the following plants, obtained from the Woodhall\r\ndistrict, presenting a striking difference to the plants found about\r\nAlford, owing to the sandy moorland soil of Woodhall:—Calluna Erica\r\n(ling), Erica Tetralix (cross-leaved heath), Artemisia Vulgaris\r\n(mugwort).  Marrubium Vulgare (white horehound), Teucrium Scorodonia\r\n(wood sage), Hydrocotyle Vulgaris (white-rot), and the Hardfern (Lomaria\r\nSpicant); also fruiting specimens of Solidago Virgaurea (golden rod),\r\nLepidium Campestre (field pepper-wort), Cotyledon Umbilicus (wall\r\npenny-wort).”\r\n\r\nI conducted the members of the Lincoln Natural History and Archæological\r\nSociety round the neighbourhood a few years ago, in the month of April,\r\nand they reported 39 plants as being then in flower, the most interesting\r\nbeing Saxifraga Tridactylites (stone-crop), Draba Verna (vernal whitlow\r\ngrass), Erodium Cicutarium (hemlock, stork’s bill), Cotyledon Umbilicus\r\n(wall pennywort), and the Tussilago Petasites (butter-bur), Stellaria\r\nHolostea (greater stitchwort); also Parietaria Officinalis (wall\r\npellitory), not yet in bloom, and in a pond Stratiotes Aloides (water\r\nsoldier) in great abundance.\r\n\r\nMore recently I conducted the members of the Lincolnshire Natural History\r\nUnion through the district, in the month of August, and the following is\r\na list of their chief “finds”; Hieracium Boreale (hawkweed), Lysimachia\r\nVulgaris (yellow loose strife), Melampyrum Pratense (yellow-cow wheat),\r\nTycopus Europeus (gipsy-wort), Solidago Virgaurea (golden rod), Malva\r\nMoschata (musk mallow), also a white variety of the common mallow (Malva\r\nSylvestris), the two cresses, Lepidium Smithii and L. Campestre,\r\nSparganium Simplex (simple bur-reed) the mints (Mentha Sativa, and M.\r\nArvensis), Lythrum Salicaria (purple loosestrife), Geranium Columbinum\r\n(long-stalked cranesbill), Scutellaria Galericulata (skull-cap),\r\nPolygonum Hydropiper (water pepper), Lysimachia Nemorum (yellow\r\npimpernel), Rhamnus Frangula (buckthorn), Gentiana Pneumonantha (blue\r\ngentian), Erica, Cinerea (heath), Malva Rotundifolia (round-leaved\r\nmallow), Marrubium Vulgare (white horehound), Calamintha Acinos (basil\r\nthyme), Eriophorum Angustifolium (cotton grass), Narthekium Ossifragum\r\n(bog asphodel), Galeopsis Bifida (hemp nettle), Senecio Sylvaticus\r\n(ragwort), three St. John’s worts, viz. Hypericum Pulchrum, H.\r\nQuaodrangulum, and H. Perforatum, Spergula Arvensis (corn spurrey),\r\nSaponaria Officinalis (common soap wort), Drosera Rotundifolia\r\n(round-leaved sundew), D. Intermedia (intermediate variety), Epilobium\r\nMacrocarpum (long-fruited willow herb), E. Parviflorum (small flowered\r\ndo.).  E. Palustre (marsh do.), Circœa Lutetiana (enchanter’s\r\nnight-shade), Pimpinella Magna (greater burnet saxifrage), Valeriana\r\nSambucifolia (elder-leaved valerian), Solidago Virgaunea (golden rod),\r\nGnaphalium Sylvaticum (high land cudwort), Hieracium Umbellatum\r\n(narrow-leaved hawk weed), Alnus Glutinosa (common alder), Juncus\r\nAcutiflorus (sharp-flowered rush), Anagallis Pallida (pale-coloured\r\npimpernel), Pedicularitis Sylvatica (dwarf red rattle), Pinguicola\r\nVulgaris (common butter-wort), Viola Flavicornis, also called V.\r\nEricetorum (yellow-horned violet). {31}  The Cichorium (succory) and\r\nParnassia Palustris (grass of Parnassus) are found in the neighbourhood.\r\nThe Myrica (“Gale” or bog-myrtle) is very abundant, and a useful\r\npreventive against the moth if placed in wardrobes or drawers.  Like the\r\nOsmunda, the Pinguicola (butterwort), appears to be now extinct, owing\r\neither to drainage or to the ever-offending collector.  Another\r\ninteresting plant which at present is not to be found, though it may at\r\nany time recur, {32} is the Holy thistle, or Mary thistle (Carduus\r\nMarianus).  Formerly plentiful, a mile away from the Spa, about the ruins\r\nof Kirkstead Abbey, it has been of late years entirely stubbed up by\r\nsuccessive tenants of the farm.  There is one locality, about three miles\r\ndistant, to which specimens were transplanted a few years ago, and where\r\nit still survives.  It also grew not far from the church of Old Woodhall,\r\nbut there also farmers’ operations have exterminated it.  Called the\r\n“Milk” or “St. Mary’s” thistle, because its white-veined leaves were\r\ntraditionally said to have been lashed with the virgin’s milk, it is\r\ndoubtless a survivor from the gardens tended and cherished by the monk of\r\nold.  The Botrychium Lunaria (moonwort) and Ophioglossum (adder’s tongue)\r\nare found within 300 yards of the Baths (occasionally intermittent for a\r\nseason); the Trichomanes (English maidenhair) grows in one solitary place\r\non the inner walls of a closed well, though entirely unknown anywhere\r\nelse for many miles round.  Several varieties of ferns grow very\r\nluxuriantly.  Before leaving the botany of the neighbourhood, I would\r\ndirect the reader to an appendix at the end of this volume, giving a list\r\nof a considerable number of plants with their local vernacular names,\r\nwhich was compiled for me by a naturalist, who made this subject his\r\nspecial study during a prolonged sojourn at Woodhall Spa.\r\n\r\nThere are several different mosses, and a great variety of fungi.\r\n\r\nThis varied flora conduces to a corresponding variety of insect life.  On\r\none of the occasions referred to above, the following beetles were\r\nfound:—Loricera Pillicornis, Geotrupes Spiniger, G. Stercorarius,\r\nElaphras Cupreus, Leistotrophus Nebulosus, Hister Stercorarius, Aphodius\r\nFœtens, A. Fimitarius, A. Sordidus, 22-Punctata, and Sphœridium\r\nBi-pustulatum.\r\n\r\nOf butterflies there is not a great variety.  The Papilio Machaon\r\n(swallow-tail) used to be common about the reedy pools and bogs near the\r\nMoor; but owing to drainage and clearance none have been seen for several\r\nyears.  The huge heaps of the aromatic ant were formerly very common in\r\nthe woods close to the Spa, but the eggs being a favourite food for the\r\npheasant, and collected by the keepers for that purpose, there seems to\r\nbe none left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.  DENIZENS OF THE WOODS, &c.—BIPEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now proceed to speak of some of the birds of the locality.  And again\r\nit may be said, as in the case of the wild flowers, that, from the\r\nvariety of soils, there is a corresponding abundance in the species\r\nfrequenting the neighbourhood of Woodhall.  Unfortunately another remark\r\nmade of the flowers also applies to the birds.  “Ichabod” may be written\r\nin large characters over the records of several.  In the writer’s youth,\r\nan old couple lived close to the Tower on the Moor, about a mile from the\r\nSpa, in a cabin of their own construction, made chiefly of sods, then\r\nlocally called “bages.” {33}  Old Dawson, or “Tabshag,” the soubriquet by\r\nwhich he was more commonly known, lived with his wife the rather wild\r\nexistence of a squatter, on the waste, under sufferance from the owner.\r\nHe kept a pig, and was wont to boast that he possessed the highest pigsty\r\nand the lowest barn in the country, because the sty was a structure of\r\nhis own erection, in the old brick tower, above the level of the\r\nsurrounding ground; while his straw was stored in an excavation (still\r\nexisting) several feet below.  At that time between the Tower and Bracken\r\nWood there was a stretch of waste land, several acres in extent,\r\nconsisting of bog, interspersed with tussocks of coarse grass, and\r\nstraggling alders and birches, still known by the name of “The Bog’s\r\nNook,” or corner. {34a}  On this ground the common green plover—Vanellus\r\ncristatus—then commonly called the “Pyewipe,” {34b} bred in large\r\nnumbers; the eggs were, as they are still, regarded as a delicacy, and\r\nold “Tabshag” used to make a considerable sum of money every year by\r\nsending hampers of these eggs by coach up to London for sale.  So\r\nfamiliar he was said to be with the habits of the bird that he could tell\r\nby its cry how many eggs were in the nest. {34c}  This land is now under\r\ncultivation, and the plaintive cry of the plover is heard no more, or\r\nonly seldom.  The plover, indeed, is still with us, but in numbers\r\nlessening every year.  There are probably not now as many plovers’ nests\r\nin the whole parish as there formerly were in a single ploughed field.\r\nThe writer, as a boy, was somewhat of an expert in finding these nests.\r\nHe has watched the birds making them, which they do by turning round and\r\nround, with the breast or belly on the ground, thus forming a\r\nsaucer-shaped hollow, in which they sometimes place two or three fibres\r\nof twitch as a lining.  One bird makes three or four of such nests, and\r\nfinally selects the one which, presumably, she deems most unnoticeable.\r\n\r\nSixty years ago black game were found on the moorland called now “The\r\nOstler Plantations,” {34d} but though one still heard of them “in the\r\nforties,” they were then either extinct or a rapidly vanishing quantity.\r\nAt the same time also the “boom” of the bittern might still be heard in\r\nthe marshy parts of the same ground, but they are also now among the has\r\nbeen’s.\r\n\r\n    No more shall bittern boom,\r\n    No more shall blackcock crow:\r\n    For both have met their doom,\r\n    The sport of human foe.\r\n\r\nFrom the character of the Ostler ground, formerly a very secluded tract\r\nof mixed wood, moor, and morass, it has been frequented by a great\r\nvariety of birds. {35}  The heron bred there within the last twenty\r\nyears, a solitary nest remaining in a clump of trees in the south-west\r\ncorner next to Tattershall, until it was blown down by a gale, and, the\r\nparticular tree being shortly afterwards felled, the bird never returned.\r\nDrainage and the destruction of trees by the woodman’s axe, or by\r\naccidental fires, have so dried the ground as to reduce greatly the\r\nnumbers of certain birds of aquatic or semi-aquatic habits.  The coot\r\n“clanking” in the sedgy pools is no more heard.  The moor-hen with those\r\nlittle, black, fluffy balls which formed her brood scuttling over the\r\nwater to hide in the reeds, is rarely seen.  The wild duck has, indeed,\r\nin one or two instances nested near a still-surviving pool within the\r\nlast ten years; a nest was once found by the writer among the branches of\r\na pollard willow, overhanging a pool, some five or six feet from the\r\nground.  He has also shot teal on odd occasions lying in the open; but\r\nboth these birds are now rarely seen, and the same may be said of the\r\nsnipe, “jack” and “full.”  The latter were once plentiful, so that it was\r\na common occurrence to put up a “whisp” of them, whereas now one seldom\r\nsees more than three or four in a whole season.  A delicate little bird,\r\nvery palatable on the table, was the waterrail, now almost extinct.  The\r\nwriter used to have permission to shoot along the “ballast ponds” beside\r\nthe railway, and he has frequently shot them there.  The woodcock is\r\nstill with us.  The poet painter, Dante Rosetti, kept one as a favourite\r\npet; we of Woodhall are more prosaic, and like to see the bird rise out\r\nof the bracken before us, and fall to our shot, eventually to appear\r\nnicely cooked on a toast before us at table.  But of late years drainage\r\nhas reduced their numbers.  Although we could, of course, never at\r\nWoodhall, compete with the shooter on the Irish bogs, where as many as\r\n100 or 200 are sometimes shot in a day; yet I could at one time almost\r\nalways get a brace when I wanted them by trying certain spots which were\r\ntheir regular resort, and among my notes I find this: “Nov. 16, 1872,\r\nshot Bracken wood, got five woodcock, making 20 in three days.”\r\n[N.B.—Bracken wood, as the visitor may not know, is within one field of\r\nthe Bath-house at Woodhall Spa.]  Some years ago certain sportsmen (?) in\r\nthis neighbourhood used to go to the sea coast every year, in October, at\r\nthe time of the arrival of the first flight of woodcock (the second\r\nflight is in November), and shot them in considerable numbers, when they\r\nwere resting, exhausted by their flight; hardly a creditable practice,\r\nand unworthy of a true lover of nature.  A wood in Kirkstead, named\r\n“Bird-Hag Wood,” was formerly a favourite haunt of the woodcock, and I\r\nhave shot many in it; but it was cleared away in the seventies. {36a}\r\nWoodcock occasionally breed on the moor, and a nest was found some years\r\nago within 80 yards of the road to Horncastle, opposite the Tower on the\r\nMoor.  Among my notes I find this: “Dec. 5, 1872, we saw about a dozen\r\nwoodcock in Bird-Hag Wood, but only three were shot.”\r\n\r\nI have just mentioned Bird-Hag and its woodcock.  Pleasant memories of\r\nthat wood have lingered with more than one sportsman.  A former poetic\r\nowner of Kirkstead has written of it thus {36b}:—\r\n\r\n    Remote Bird-Hag, that favourite preserve,\r\n    To crown some chosen day, the choice reserve\r\n    Where noble oaks their autumn tints display,\r\n    And fern gigantic checks the sportsman’s way\r\n    But well is toil and trouble there repaid,\r\n    By the wild tenants of that oaken shade,\r\n    While rabbits, hares, successive, cross your road,\r\n    And scarcely give the time to fire and load,—\r\n    While shots resound, and pheasants loudly crow,\r\n    Who heeds the bramble?  Who fatigue can know?\r\n    Here from the brake, that bird of stealthy flight,\r\n    The mottled woodcock glads our eager sight,\r\n    Great is his triumph, whose lucky shot shall kill\r\n    The dark-eyed stranger of the lengthy bill\r\n    Unlike the pheasant, who himself betrays,\r\n    And dearly for his daring challenge pays.\r\n    Small notice gives the woodcock of his flight;\r\n    Not seen at once, at once he’s lost to sight.\r\n    Yet short his flight, and should you mark him down,\r\n    The chances are that woodcock is your own;\r\n    But quick the hand, and no less quick the eye,\r\n    Would stop him as he hurries by;\r\n    Few are the birds, whate’er may be their sort,\r\n    More try the skill, give more exciting sport.\r\n\r\nA few words may be said on the pheasants and partridges; and first of the\r\nformer.  The breed on the Ostler ground have a history.  The late Sir\r\nHenry Dymoke, of Scrivelsby Court, used to rear, in large numbers, a\r\nwhite breed of pheasant, and as, with the exception of the Ostler ground,\r\nhe, with his brother, had almost the whole of the shooting, extending\r\nfrom Scrivelsby to the Witham, they spread over that ground, and sought a\r\nkind of asylum in the dense cover of the Ostler plantations.  Further,\r\nthe writer’s father-in-law imported an Indian breed, called the “Kalege”\r\npheasant, a very handsome bird; and these two strains have affected the\r\nbreed on that ground, and, doubtless, have also had their effect on\r\npheasants in the neighbourhood generally.  White broods of pheasants are\r\nfrom time to time hatched on the ground; also piebald varieties are not\r\nuncommon.  In the year 1898, a cream-coloured specimen was shot.  Some of\r\nthe cocks have at times a decided fringe of blue or purple in their\r\nplumages from the Kalege mixture.\r\n\r\nAs to partridges: It is only in recent years that the French, or\r\nred-legged breed (Cannabis rufa) have established themselves here.  In\r\nthe sixties, though said to have been introduced into England by Charles\r\nII., they were almost, if not entirely, unknown here.  The writer shot\r\nthem in Cambridgeshire in the fifties; and from the south-eastern coast\r\nand counties they have persistently spread, until now we have them\r\neverywhere.  In the first instance, probably, they were brought across\r\n“the silver streak” by a gale, like the sand grouse, of which we have\r\nread, on the coast of Yorkshire.  But whereas the sand grouse were\r\nimmediately shot as curiosities, the red-leg, being a bird (as every\r\nshooter knows) given to running, knew how to take care of himself, and,\r\nlike many another unwelcome intruder, he _came to stay_.  The flesh is\r\ndecidedly inferior in flavour to that of the common English brown\r\npartridge.  I well remember a practical joke being played on a Woodhall\r\nkeeper.  The “Frenchmen,” as they were called, had only just arrived.  A\r\nparty of us were out shooting, and a red-leg was shot.  The keeper,\r\nseeing the new and handsome-looking bird, was very proud of it, and\r\nthough he had never yet tasted one, he loudly proclaimed, in his\r\nignorance, that it would be as good in the eating as fine in the plumage.\r\nA day or two after we were out shooting again.  Luncheon time came, and\r\nwe lay stretched on the sward under a spreading tree, on a hot day in\r\nSeptember, where the ladies joined us, bringing the refreshment.  Cold\r\npartridges were among the fare, and instructions had been given\r\nbeforehand that the “Frenchman” should be specially reserved, to hand to\r\nthe keeper.  In due course the Captain passed on to the keeper—as being\r\nspecially favoured “above his fellows,” by the attention—half of a\r\npartridge.  Nothing was said, and we all busied ourselves with the viands\r\nbefore us, but the keeper was under our careful observation.  Presently\r\nhis features were seen to be considerably distorted by wry faces, as he\r\nturned the leg or the wing about in his hands, while picking them, with\r\nsome difficulty, to the bone.  Probably the bird was not only a\r\n“Frenchman,” but a tough old cock into the bargain.  At length he could\r\nstand it no longer, and, looking round at us, he said, “Dal it! Captain,\r\nbut this bird’s a rum ’un.”  “Don’t you like it?” was the reply; “why,\r\nit’s the handsome Frenchman you admired so much, when it was shot the\r\nother day.”  “Well, then,” said the keeper, “I wish all such Frenchmen\r\nwere at the battle of Water-gruel.  I’ll back the English.” {38}\r\n\r\nThere are some rather curious facts in connection with the brown English\r\npartridge and the French variety.  Though different in their habits, and,\r\nit is said, even hostile to each other, they yet, in some instances,\r\nconsort.  I once shot on the moor three brown and one red-leg, out of the\r\nsame covey, all young birds.  They had evidently been reared together in\r\none brood, and the old birds were of the brown species.  Mentioning this\r\nto a friend of large experience, he told me that he had known several\r\ninstances where the eggs of the two kinds had been found laid in the same\r\nnest.  The eggs are, of course, easily distinguishable, those of the\r\ncommon partridge being of a greenish drab colour, while those of the\r\nred-leg are of a dull, cream colour, covered with small brown spots.  I\r\nhave been informed by another authority that the eggs of the red-leg have\r\nalso been found in the nest of an outlying pheasant. {39}  A curious\r\nprovision of nature, conducing to the preservation of the species, may be\r\nhere mentioned as interesting; the partridge, while sitting on her eggs,\r\nhas no scent.  On one occasion a man was consulting me about a tombstone\r\nat St. Andrew’s Church, Woodhall.  We walked into the churchyard\r\ntogether, and stood conversing opposite the grave in question.  I was\r\naware that a partridge was sitting on her nest concealed in the grass\r\nbetween that grave and the next, and therefore would not approach very\r\nnear.  Suddenly I perceived that he had a terrier with him, which was\r\nvery busily hunting over the churchyard.  I begged him to keep it in.  He\r\nwas rather indignant, and replied that it could do no harm in the\r\nchurchyard.  I remarked that he was not aware that within eight or ten\r\nfeet of us a partridge was on her nest, and I did not wish her to be\r\ndisturbed.  He thereupon called in his dog, but that only brought his dog\r\nnearer to the nest, hunting the while; and the dog actually passed over\r\nthe nest without scenting the bird. {40}  The eggs were hatched the next\r\nday, and that doubtless accounted for her sitting so closely.  Whether or\r\nnot from an instinctive consciousness of this safeguard is not for me to\r\nsay, but the partridge is rather given to selecting her nesting place\r\nnear a highway or a footpath.  I have known several instances of this,\r\nand only last year I repeatedly saw both the parent birds sitting on\r\ntheir nest together, on a bank close to a public footpath which was daily\r\ntraversed.\r\n\r\nTo show how closely a partridge will continue to sit, under very trying\r\ncircumstances, I give here an anecdote of what occurred in a parish\r\nadjoining Woodhall Spa, as it was related to me by the chief witness, the\r\nSquire himself.\r\n\r\nIn a meadow adjoining Roughton Hall, a partridge made her nest in a\r\nslight depression of the surface.  The meadow was, in due course, mown,\r\nthe mower passing his scythe over her without injuring her, and unaware\r\nof her presence, the depression having still enough grass to conceal the\r\nnest.  The field was afterwards “tedded,” i.e., the grass was tossed\r\nabout by a machine, which again passed over the nest, still leaving her\r\nunscathed and unmoved.  In the process of “cocking,” the field was next\r\nhorse-raked, the rake passing over the nest, with the same result.  One\r\nof the haymakers, however, nearly trod on the nest; this drove the bird\r\noff, behind him, so that he did not observe it.  But a friend was near at\r\nhand.  The squire, seeing the bird fly away, went to the spot, found the\r\nhidden nest, and counted in it the unusual number of 19 eggs (promise of\r\na good partridge season, weather permitting).  He at once removed to a\r\ndistance all the hay lying near, to prevent her being disturbed again,\r\nand watched the result.  Within a quarter of an hour the partridge\r\nquietly returned to her nest.  Ten days later she successfully brought\r\noff a brood of seventeen, two bad eggs remaining in the nest.  Of course,\r\nas the hatching time draws near, the mother, feeling the young lives\r\nunder her, sits more persistently than at an earlier period; but surely\r\nthis mother partridge exhibited a remarkable instance of fidelity to\r\nmaternal instinct, after passing through no less than four trying\r\nordeals.\r\n\r\nOf wild pigeons we have three kinds: the common woodpigeon or ringdove,\r\nof which there are large flocks; the stockdoves, which go in pairs, and\r\n(as their name implies) build their nest on a solitary stump or tree, or\r\noccasionally in a rabbit hole.  The turtledove, though common in the\r\nsouth of England, is a migratory bird, and in these parts not a constant\r\nvisitor.  A “wave” of them spread over the Midland counties in 1895, and\r\nsince that they have been seen in smaller numbers.  The late Mr. J.\r\nCordeaux, F.R.G.S., M.B.O.U., one of our greatest authorities, says that\r\nits note is lower and more of a querulous murmur than that of the\r\nringdove.  In size it is not much larger than a missel thrush.\r\n\r\nThe first of these pigeons is the bird named the “Culver,” in old\r\nwritings, as Spencer sings in romantic ditty:—\r\n\r\n    Like as the culver, on the bared bough,\r\n       Sits mourning for the absence of her mate,\r\n    And in her song breathes many a wistful vow\r\n       For his return, who seems to linger late,\r\n    So I, alone, now left disconsolate.\r\n       Mourn to myself the absence of my love,\r\n    And sitting here, all desolate,\r\n       Seek with my plaints to match that mournful dove.\r\n\r\nOf woodpeckers we have on the moor and in Bracken Wood at times, three\r\nkinds: the common green species (picus viridis) which is generally\r\nplentiful; the lesser spotted (picus minor), not seen every year, but\r\noccasionally; and, still less frequently seen, the larger spotted (picus\r\nmajor).  Of the former of these spotted kinds, seeing three together, I\r\nshot one a few years ago; and the keeper shot another for me more\r\nrecently, for our Naturalists’ Museum at Lincoln.\r\n\r\nOf the “birds of prey,” so called, the greatest part are extinct, or\r\nnearly so, too often from a mistaken belief in their destructiveness;\r\nwhereas they are really useful allies of the farmer, if not also of the\r\nsportsman.  In the cause of the latter, they, for the most part destroy\r\n(if they destroy game at all) the weakly members, so conducing towards\r\nkeeping up a vigorous breed, and for the farmer they destroy smaller\r\nvermin, the mice which, but for them, would multiply (as they have done\r\nin several places) until they become a plague.  In the year 1890, a very\r\nlarge bird was reported as being seen about the woods near Woodhall, but\r\nI could not get a sight of it myself, nor could I get anyone else to give\r\na description of it, except that it was very large.  After a time it\r\ndisappeared from Woodhall, and was reported as being seen for a time\r\nabout Revesby, and on November 8th an eagle was shot by the son of a\r\nfarmer residing at Tupholme Hall, in a wood at Southrey belonging to Mr.\r\nVyner.  It proved to be a male bird, in good condition, measuring 6ft.\r\n7in. across the wings, and weighing 11lbs.  I rode over to see it, but it\r\nhad been sent to the taxidermist to be stuffed.  It was a sea eagle\r\n(Haliactus albicilla).  The kite (milvus ictinus) used to be common 40\r\nyears ago; its presence being notified by our hens cackling, and ducks\r\nquacking, as they called together their broods, when they espied it\r\nsoaring at a considerable height above.  If a reckless chick, or\r\nduckling, neglected to take the warning, and seek shelter beneath the\r\nmother’s wings, there was for a moment a rushing sound, a general\r\nconfusion in the poultry yard, a half-smothered scream, and the kite flew\r\naway with a victim in its claws. {42}  I have seen this more than once\r\nmyself.  The kite is now quite extinct in this neighbourhood.  The same\r\nmay be said of the buzzard (buteo vulgaris).  Although their food was\r\nchiefly mice and small birds; perhaps occasionally game, but not\r\ngenerally; since, though a very fine bird in appearance, they were not\r\nrapid enough on the wing to overtake the partridge in full flight; yet\r\nthe keepers waged war against them “to the knife.”  Many is the buzzard I\r\nhave seen nailed up with the pole-cats and other vermin in the woods at\r\nWoodhall.  But they are now seen no more, and a handsome and\r\ncomparatively harmless ornament of our sylvan scenery is gone beyond\r\nrecall.\r\n\r\nThe Hen-Harrier (circus cyaneus), a more active bird than the buzzard, is\r\nanother of the “Ichabods.”  Its last known nesting place was on the top\r\nof “The Tower on the Moor,” near Woodhall.  As a boy, the writer has\r\nclimbed that tower for the eggs, and he has now a very fine specimen of\r\nthe old bird stuffed, measuring about 40 inches across, from tip to tip\r\nof the wings.  These birds were wont to fly at higher game than the\r\nbuzzard, and doubtless did at times destroy partridges; but they also fed\r\nlargely on water-rats and frogs, and were not above gorging themselves on\r\ncarrion.  The female is larger than the male.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful little Merlin (Falco Æsalon) was also seen, though not\r\ncommon, twenty-five or thirty years ago.  It was a very plucky little\r\nbird, and I have seen one strike down a partridge larger in bulk than\r\nitself.  This is gone, never to return.\r\n\r\nThe Sparrow-Hawk (Accipiter fringillarius) survives, although in\r\ndiminished numbers; and this indeed is the only one of the hawks against\r\nwhich “my voice should be for open war.”  It is very destructive and very\r\ndaring in the pursuit of its quarry.  A connection of my own was sitting\r\nin a room facing the garden at the Victoria Hotel, Woodhall, when a\r\nsparrow-hawk dashed after its prey, broke the glass of the window, and\r\nfell stunned on the floor of the room.  The female in this kind also is\r\nlarger than the mate.  This bird will kill young ducks and chickens, and\r\npartridges, and even pheasants.\r\n\r\nThe Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) also still survives, and we do not grudge\r\nit a prolonged lease of life.  It feeds chiefly upon mice and small\r\nbirds, cockchafers, and other insects; is a graceful object as it hangs\r\nlightly hovering at a considerable height in the air; with its keen\r\nvision detects its small prey half hidden in the grass or stubble, and\r\nthen with lightning rapidity, drops like a stone upon it, and bears it\r\naway.  I have kept kestrels and sparrow-hawks and tamed them; and the\r\nformer will become tractable and almost affectionate, but the latter is a\r\nwinged Ishmaelite, and very treacherous, and if allowed a little liberty,\r\nit generally ends in his making his escape. {44a}\r\n\r\nOwls are still, I am glad to say, plentiful.  They are amongst the\r\nfarmers’ greatest feathered friends, killing enormous quantities of mice,\r\nwhich otherwise would damage his crops. {44b}  We have three kinds on the\r\nmoor or in the woods: 1st—the barn owl, or screech owl (stryx flammea);\r\n2nd—the wood or brown owl (synnium aluco); 3rd—the horned-owl (asio\r\notus).  The two last are very much alike in both size and colour, but the\r\nlast has two tufts of feathers rising on each aide of the head, from\r\nwhich it gets its name of horned-owl.  I have a note among my shooting\r\nrecords: “Dec. 5th, 1872, shot Bird Hag Wood, in Kirkstead, put up about\r\na dozen owls.”  These would be the “horned” kind.  Five were shot on that\r\noccasion, but as a rule they have been carefully spared, one only\r\noccasionally being killed as a specimen for stuffing.  Within the\r\nnineties, being out with my gun, on the moor, when the ground was covered\r\nwith snow, I passed by a solitary thick Scotch fir, when an owl flew out.\r\nI wanted a specimen for a friend who was staying with me, and I shot it.\r\nThe report created quite a commotion within the tree, and some twenty\r\nowls were immediately flying about me.  Not being likely to settle in the\r\nsnow, and apparently dazed by the glare of the sun reflected from the\r\nsnow, I left them as quickly as I could, to recover their composure, and\r\nreturn to the sheltered quarters in which they had congregated.  Hunting,\r\nas they do, almost entirely by night, they have little opportunity of\r\ninterfering with the game, nor is it their propensity to do so. {45}\r\nThere are three very ancient hollow oak trees in “The Arbours” Wood in\r\nKirkstead.  These are a favourite resort of the barn owl.\r\n\r\nThe carrion crow still nests on the moor, although the eggs are taken\r\nevery season.  But the old birds are very wary, and manage to keep out of\r\nshot.  The common rook, however, of late years, has got a bad name, as\r\nhaving taken up the marauding habits of the genuine crow.  Owing to the\r\nimproved cultivation of land, there is not now the supply of grubs on\r\nwhich the rook used to feed, and they have taken to hunting for the eggs\r\nof partridge and pheasant, and may be seen “quartering” the ground as\r\nmethodically as a pointer or setter.  They are strongly suspected of\r\nkilling the young as well as rifling the nests of eggs, and the Scotch\r\nkeepers complain of their depredations on the moors, among the young\r\ngrouse.\r\n\r\nA writer in the “Yorkshire Poet” (of August 22, 1898) says that black\r\ngame are decreasing in the Border counties, as the rooks destroy the\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nThis completes the list of the larger birds frequenting the\r\nneighbourhood.  As I write this chapter, a letter from an old friend says\r\nthat he well remembers the number of night-jars which were to be heard\r\n“churring” about Woodhall on a summer’s evening.  This bird (caprimulgus\r\nEuropœus), locally called fern-owl, comes to us about May.  I have a\r\nnote: “May 23rd, 1873, the first night-jar heard.”  During the daytime,\r\nthe visitor, walking quietly through the woodland paths near the Victoria\r\nHotel, may, if he has a keen eye, see the night-jar lying flat upon the\r\nbranch of an oak, hardly indeed perceptible, owing to its colour being so\r\nnear that of the brown bark.  Then, towards evening, it may be seen\r\ntaking its short and wonderfully rapid flights, and you may hear its\r\nbills snap together as it catches the moths and cockchafers on which it\r\nfeeds.  It breeds on the moor, the nest generally being laid on the\r\nground among the bracken; whence its name of fern-owl.  The old idea of\r\nits sucking the goat or cow, from the former of which it gets its\r\nclassical name caprimulgus (as well as the English equivalent), is, of\r\ncourse, long since exploded. {46a}  The churring note is seldom heard\r\nexcept when it is at rest on a branch of a tree.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant little Kingfisher (Alcedo ispida), the most gay in colour\r\nof all our birds, may still sometimes be seen, darting about the only\r\nrivulet which we can boast of at Woodhall, and which rejoices in the\r\nunattractive name of “The Sewer,” {46b} although its water, welling up at\r\nits source near Well Syke Wood, is beautifully clear and pure.  The\r\noccurrence, however, of the bird here is rare.  An old inhabitant of\r\nKirkby assures me that it is not uncommon on the river Bain, in that\r\nparish; and of late years, partly through the writer’s influence, it may\r\nbe seen on the rivers Bain or Waring, in the heart of Horncastle,\r\nunmolested, and even fed, by the people.\r\n\r\nThe Grey Fly Catcher (Muscicapa Grisola) is fairly common on our lawns,\r\nwhere it will sit quietly on a garden seat, or roller, and thence take\r\nits short jerky flight after the flies.  I have known it to nest year\r\nafter year, at the Vicarage, in a hole in the wall, where an iron\r\nventilator was broken.\r\n\r\nThe Wryneck (Yunx Torquilla) is a somewhat uncommon bird at Woodhall,\r\nthough a pretty one.  For several years it also frequented the Vicarage\r\ngarden, sometimes four or five of them, during the summer months.  One\r\nyear there were so many that I shot one and had it stuffed, and I found\r\nthat at the same time a noble Marquis was having two stuffed, as being\r\nrather rare.  It is called in some parts of the country the “weet” bird,\r\nfrom its peculiar note; other authorities say that the note is\r\nrepresented by the words, “Peel, peel,” or “Peep-peep.”  I should myself\r\nsay “Snipe, snipe” was nearer to the sound, and a writer compares it to\r\nthe sound of Punch, in the old show of “Punch and Judy,” which I think\r\ncomes nearer to my own interpretation.  The body of this bird is in\r\ncolour a mixture of grey and brown, but its tail and wings are most\r\nbeautifully marked with dark zig-zag bars, which make it very handsome.\r\nIn size it is between the blackbird and the lark.  Like the woodpecker,\r\nit has a very long tongue, which is covered with a glutinous matter, and\r\nwhich it inserts into the grass roots or tree bark, in search of its\r\nfood. {47}\r\n\r\nI give here a list of birds which I have stuffed, all of which were\r\nkilled in this neighbourhood:—Night-jar (Caprimulgus Europœus), wry neck\r\n(Yunx Torquilla), buff blackbird (Turdus merula), razorbill (Alca Torda),\r\nlittle auk (Mergulus Alia), ruff (Machetes Pugnax), green sand piper\r\n(Totanus Octaopus), snipe (Scolopax gallinago), water rail (Rallus\r\nAquaticus), golden plover (Charadrius Pluvialis), woodcock (Scolopax\r\nRusticola), large spotted wood pecker (Dendrocopus Major), hawfinch\r\n(Coccothraustes Vulgaris), cuckoo (Cuculus Canorus), jay (Garrulus\r\nGlandarius), French partridge (Cannabis Rufa), turtledove (Turtur\r\nAuritus), horned owl (Asio Otus), hen harrier (Circus Cyaneus), kestrel\r\n(Falco Tinnunculus), peregrine falcon (Falco Peregrinus), piebald\r\npheasant (phasianus colchicus), buff pheasant, cormorant (phylacrocorax\r\ncarbo), jay (corvus glandarius), heron (ardea cinerea), horned owl (asio\r\notus).\r\n\r\nIn times gone by, never to return, the numbers and variety of wild fowls\r\nfrequenting the Witham, with its “sykes and meres,” was something\r\nextraordinary.  Charles Kingsley doubtless wrote, if not of his own\r\nknowledge, yet, at furthest, at second hand, when he gave the following\r\ndescription: “Grand it was, while dark green alders and pale green reeds\r\nstretched for miles . . . where the coot clanked, and the bittern boomed,\r\nand the sedgebird, not content with its own sweet song, mocked the notes\r\nof all the birds around . . . far off upon the silver mere would rise a\r\npuff of smoke from a punt, invisible from its flatness.  Then down the\r\nwind came the boom of the great stanchion-gun; and after that another\r\nsound, louder as it neared; a cry as of all the bells of Cambridge, and\r\nall the hounds of Cottesmore; and overhead rushed and whirled the skeins\r\nof terrified wildfowl, screaming, piping, clacking, croaking, filling the\r\nair with the hoarse rattle of their wings; while, clear above all,\r\nsounded the wild whistle of the curlew, and the trumpet note of the wild\r\nswan.”  “Prose Idylls,” The Fens.\r\n\r\n    The living clouds on clouds arose,\r\n    Infinite wing!  Till all the plume-dart air\r\n    And rude resounding shore was one wild cry.\r\n\r\nOf the swans, we may observe that not only did this bird, in its wild\r\nstate, frequent the Witham and the Fen waters, but the swannery was a\r\nvaluable possession.  The Abbots of Bardney and Kirkstead owned\r\nswanneries on the Witham.  (“Archæol.” vol. xvi., p. 153).  The swans of\r\nvarious owners were distinguished by marks on the upper mandible, and\r\nthere were no less than 97 different swan marks on the Witham.  A rhyming\r\nlist of the birds of the Witham is given in Drayton’s Polyolbion (song\r\n25), too long to quote here; suffice it to say that one parish alone,\r\nnear Boston, some 60 years ago, sent 30,000 wild fowl in a year to\r\nLondon—(Thompson’s History, Boston).  The bird’s captured by net were\r\ndunlins, knots, ruffs, reeves, red-shanks, lapwings, golden plovers,\r\ncurlews, godwits, etc.  One fowler stated that he had so taken 24 dozen\r\nlapwings in one day, and four dozen and nine at one time.—Stevenson’s\r\n“Birds of Norfolk,” vol. i., p. 57.  Other birds shot by the fowlers were\r\nmallard, teal, widgeon, whimbrells, grebes of several kinds, and the\r\n“yelping” avocet.  A relative of the present writer owned a decoy, where\r\nsome 20,000 wild ducks were taken, within his own recollection, in one\r\nseason. {49}\r\n\r\nWe now come to the last bird which I shall name in this somewhat lengthy\r\nlist; a goddess among birds, as someone has almost literally called her,\r\n“œmula divini suavissima carminis ales”; and the old Scotch poet, William\r\nDrummond, of Hawthornden, says:—\r\n\r\n    Sweet artless songster! thou my mind dost raise\r\n    To airs of spheres—yes, and to angels’ lays.\r\n\r\nwhile quaint old Isaac Walton says: “She breathes such sweet music from\r\nher little instrumental throat, that it might make mankind to think that\r\nmiracles are not yet ceased.”  The nightingale was first heard in my own\r\ngarden, at the vicarage, Woodhall Spa, in the spring of 1876.  Having\r\nheard it at Cambridge, in the South of England, and also in Italy, I\r\nimmediately recognised the note, and at first was delighted at the\r\narrival of this new visitor to Woodhall Spa, who did not come needing the\r\nwater, and complaining of aches and pains, but to delight everyone with\r\nits rich flood of song.  And having thus found its way here, it has\r\nfurther found the attractions of Woodhall so great that, although\r\nfavouring no other place in the neighbourhood, it has continued its\r\nannual visits ever since, and has brought its kindred in increasing\r\nnumbers.  But, although charmed at first with its melody, the novelty\r\nwore off; and when, night after night, there were three or four of these\r\nbirds waking the echoes beneath my bedroom window, trying in jealous\r\nrivalry each to outdo the other in compassing the whole gamut, “in the\r\nrich mazes of sound,” my admiration considerably abated, and I became\r\nrather disposed to vote the performance a veritable surfeit of song, to\r\nthe utter banishment of much-needed slumber.  Before, however, I had\r\narrived at this prosaic way of viewing the “Queen of Song,” I composed in\r\nits honour the following lines, with which I shall close this chapter on\r\nthe Birds of Woodhall:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE NIGHTINGALE.\r\n2 a.m., April 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n       How from that tiny throat,\r\n          Songster of night!\r\n       Flows such a wealth of note,\r\n          Full of delight;\r\n       Trembling with resonance,\r\n          Rapid and racy,\r\n       Sinking in soft cadence,\r\n          Gushing with ecstasy,\r\n       Dying away,\r\n          All in their turns;\r\n       Plaintive and gay,\r\n    Thrilling with tones aglow,\r\n    Melting in murmurs low,\r\n       Till one’s heart burns?\r\n\r\n       Once in the wilderness,\r\n          By desert well,\r\n       Hagar in loneliness,\r\n          With Ishmael,\r\n       Sighed to the silent air,\r\n          Tears on her glistening;\r\n       Yet to her, even there,\r\n          Angels were listening,\r\n       Noting her prayer.\r\n\r\n       Even so singest thou,\r\n          _Not to thyself_,\r\n       Mayn’t there be list’ning now\r\n          Some fairy elf,\r\n       Silently sitting near\r\n          Thy dark retreat,\r\n       Drinking with grateful ear\r\n          Thy music sweet,\r\n       Ringing so clear?\r\n\r\n       No! not alone art thou;\r\n       One there’s above, e’en now,\r\n       “Whose mercy’s over all,”\r\n       “Who sees the sparrow fall;”\r\n       “To Him the night is day,”\r\n       He hears thy matin lay,\r\n       High o’er us all.\r\n\r\n       Through the hushed, slumb’ring air,\r\n          Thy accents raise,\r\n       For all his loving care\r\n          Incense of praise;\r\n       Thrilling with happiness,\r\n          Full with content,\r\n       Still asking His goodness,\r\n          Prayer with praise blent.\r\n\r\n       Little thou mayest be,\r\n          Yet art His care;\r\n       He, too, has given thee\r\n          Gifts rich and rare.\r\n    Still, then, thy voice upraise,\r\n    Still chant thy Maker’s praise\r\n    While we are rapt in sleep,\r\n    Still thou thy vigil keep;\r\n    Still let some earthly cry\r\n    Go to our God on high;\r\n    Humbly, yet fervently, piercingly call,\r\n    Call for His watchfulness over us all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.  DENIZENS OF THE WOODS, &c.  QUADRUPEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the inevitable, if regretful, duty of the recorder of the past to\r\nhave to inscribe “Obiit” over the mention of many an individual who comes\r\nunder his notice, and this applies to the four-footed animals, as well as\r\nto the birds and the wild flowers, of Woodhall.  Of some of the most\r\ninteresting, it must be said that they are gone, and their place knoweth\r\nthem no more.\r\n\r\nThe first I may mention is the Badger.  This animal used to be fairly\r\ncommon in these parts; whether it is now quite extinct is difficult to\r\nsay, because its nocturnal habits, and very retiring disposition, prevent\r\nit coming much under the observation of man.  It is supposed still to\r\nharbour in the rocks at Holbeck, some nine miles from Woodhall.  A\r\nspecimen was captured at Woodhall about the year 1885, frequenting some\r\nrabbit holes in a bank, at that time belonging to myself, and within 100\r\nyards of the present blacksmith’s shop on the Stixwould-road.  Another\r\nwas captured a few years before in the adjoining parish of Martin, which\r\nI have stuffed.  At an earlier date one was taken by a man named Thomas\r\nNorris, at Well Syke Wood, some two miles from Woodhall Spa.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1889 one was seen for some months in the Northern Dar\r\nWood, in Woodhall.  The keeper, doubtless with murderous intent, tried to\r\nfind its burrow, but did not succeed.  It was not killed so far as is\r\nknown, but disappeared.  Another was killed in June, 1898, at Mavis\r\nEnderby.  In 1903, two badgers were killed at Asgarby, and one at Asterby\r\nin 1904.  In 1899 our local pack of hounds, the South Wold, ran a badger,\r\ninstead of a fox, over several fields, until he took to ground, and was\r\nafterwards killed by one of the party, as he kept his head out of the\r\nhole.  It should hardly be a moot point whether the extermination of the\r\nbadger is an advantage or not, although a good deal has been written on\r\nboth sides of the subject.  Its skin makes the “sporran” of the kilted\r\nHighlander, and its hair makes our shaving brushes.  Though it may be\r\nfound occasionally in an enlarged rabbit burrow, it is not there to prey\r\non the rabbit; for (as Major Fisher assures us in his interesting work,\r\n“Out-door Life in England,” 1896) its diet is mainly vegetarian, and what\r\nanimal food it indulges in is mice, frogs, an occasional hedgehog, with\r\nbeetles, snails, and worms; and especially it is very partial to the\r\ngrubs of the wasp.  It is very cleanly in its habits; sometimes occupying\r\nthe same “earth” with the fox, to the great advantage of the latter, as\r\nit clears away the putrid matter brought in by Reynard, and so prevents\r\nhis contracting the mange, to which he is very liable, from his own\r\nuntidy propensities. {53a}  Being thus not only comparatively harmless,\r\nbut also serviceable to the sportsman, it is much to be regretted that\r\ncontinued war should be waged against these creatures. {53b}\r\nUnfortunately, old prejudices are but slowly overcome.  By a statute\r\nenacted in the 8th year of Queen Elizabeth, chap. 15, and confirmed by\r\nsubsequent statutes, provision was made for the destruction of what were\r\nthen deemed “noysome foule and vermine,” and the price of 1s. was set on\r\nthe head of every “fox and grey,” i.e., badger.  This act continued in\r\nforce down to 1863.  But the old ideas concerning the badger have been\r\nlong exploded among those who know anything of its habits.  The badger,\r\nfurther, is the only representative of the bear family in this country.\r\nA scion of that race, whose bones are found in our fossiliferous caverns,\r\nco-eval with the mammoth and prehistoric man, he, if any of our existing\r\nanimals, may boast of “blue blood in his veins.”  The nobleman, whose\r\nancestry came over with the conqueror, is a _parvenu_ in comparison with\r\nhim.  Surely the principle of _Noblesse oblige_ alone should ensure for\r\nhim a shelter in our woods and wastes. {54a}\r\n\r\nThe next to be mentioned of our _ferœ næturæ_, also the object of\r\nconstant persecution, and growing, consequently, rarer every year, is the\r\nOtter.  The parish of Thimbleby adjoins Woodhall Spa on the north,\r\nindeed, a large slice of it is now included in the recently created civil\r\nparish of Woodhall Spa.  At the further end of Thimbleby an otter was\r\nkilled in the year 1898, at a water mill on the river Bain, the miller\r\nerroneously supposing that it would kill his ducks.  Shortly before,\r\nanother specimen had been shot by a keeper on the same river, at\r\nGoulceby, its mate fortunately escaping.  Soon after, a young specimen\r\nwas seen several times disporting itself in the Horncastle Canal.  It\r\nthere escaped the vigilance of many would-be assassins, and gradually\r\nworked its way towards our neighbouring river, the Witham; but there it\r\nfell a victim to a gunner, who descried it in a drain near Tattershall\r\nBridge, in Billinghay Fen.  Another specimen was afterwards shot among\r\nthe dykes of Walcot Dales, near the Witham, and still another in the\r\nneighbouring parish of Martin, a few years ago.  Here again this\r\npersistent slaughter is much to be regretted.  The otter is not the enemy\r\nto the fisherman which it is too commonly supposed to be.  In the\r\n“Badminton Library,” the Honourable Geoffrey Hill says: “People are\r\nbeginning to find that the otters kill and keep down the coarser fish,\r\nespecially the eels, which live on the spawn and fry of the better\r\nsorts.”  Mr. E. Daubney, writing from the banks of the Dart, says: “They\r\neat frogs, rats, birds, fish, _et id genus omne_, but of nothing are they\r\nmore fond than the eel; for this they will give up the finest and most\r\nfresh-run salmon.” {54b}  In our own neighbourhood, in 1901, two young\r\notters were shot on a farm at Sturton; they were at a pond which abounded\r\nin eels, and had doubtless by the eels been attracted from the river\r\nBain, a mile distant, where they could only get trout.  A naturalist, who\r\nwatched some otters at their home, night and day, for more than two\r\nmonths, says that he only saw them take three trout; the first fish taken\r\nwas an eel, the second a chub, or roach.  (“Country Life,” illustrated,\r\nVol. VI., No. 134, July, 1899.)  Another authority {55a} states that the\r\nstomach of one specimen examined “was full of larvæ and earthworms”;\r\nwhile a fourth writer {55b} says, “Otters will eat celery, potatoes,\r\nyoung shoots from the hedges; and especially have they a liking for the\r\ntwo first.”  The writer has seen a dead salmon lying on a Highland river\r\nbank with the shoulder eaten away by the otter, their peculiar habit\r\nbeing to take only this part, and never to return to the body again.\r\n{55c}  But even their attacks on the salmon have indirectly a useful\r\neffect, for, as one of the authorities already quoted (Mr. E. Daubney)\r\nobserves: “If a salmon pool is visited by otters, the salmon are hustled,\r\nand so made to bestir themselves (often when sickly, and reluctant to\r\nmove), and so make the effort to get down to the sea, to return again\r\nenormously increased in size and condition, and in this way the otter\r\ndoes the sportsman a service in sending the salmon down to recruit in the\r\nsea; just as, in turn, the sea-lice which fix upon the salmon when\r\nrecruited in the salt water, so harass the fish, as to drive it once more\r\nup the river again into the fresh water, when it may afford sport to the\r\nangler.” {55d}  It is not generally known, and it has even escaped the\r\nnotice of our greatest naturalists, that the otter utters a shrill\r\nwhistle when calling to its mate or young, which might be easily mistaken\r\nfor the note of the kingfisher or sand-piper.  This has been noticed by\r\nMr. F. B. Whitlock, in the “Naturalist” for 1895, p. 381.  The great\r\nstronghold of the otter is the broads of Norfolk, where, in the sluggish,\r\nreedy water, he can get plenty of eels, snails, and so forth.  In our own\r\nneighbourhood, if the war and extirpation goes on, he will soon be a\r\nmemory only.\r\n\r\nThe next wild animal to be named as fairly common at Woodhall is the Fox.\r\nThe locality, indeed, has been for many years a stronghold {56} of\r\nReynard, as was to be expected, in a district where the woods are so\r\nextensive, although by no means so extensive as they were within the\r\nwriter’s recollection.  On one occasion, some 14 or 15 years ago, we had\r\nthe Burton hounds, and the South Wold, over the same ground, in the same\r\nmorning, within hearing, if not within sight, of each other.  The Ostler\r\nGround, especially from the thick and warm cover afforded by the heather,\r\nmay be said to be a nursery for foxes for the supply of the\r\nneighbourhood.  Not long ago there were six earths; and there are still\r\nthree, which are carefully preserved; and the bark of the dog-fox or the\r\nanswering scream of the vixen may be heard almost any night, in different\r\ndirections, while out foraging.  So thick is the cover, in parts, that\r\nthe hounds frequently fail to penetrate it; and, after the pack have gone\r\naway without a find, I have almost trodden upon a fox, on one occasion\r\nupon a brace of them, still lying snugly among the “ling” in security.\r\nThe fox does much less harm than is commonly supposed.  It will not\r\ndisturb other game if it can get rabbits, and it will not take rabbits if\r\nit can get rats.  A very old sporting farmer has repeatedly assured me\r\nthat although he had a rabbit warren near his farmstead, the rabbits were\r\nleft undisturbed, and even his chickens were safe, so long as there were\r\nrats to be captured in his corn-stacks, or in the banks about his\r\nfarm-buildings. {57} The first fox which the writer ever saw, was brought\r\nby a Woodhall man, named Hare, to his father.  It had been caught in a\r\ntrap by the leg, and had attempted to bite its own foot off, in order to\r\neffect its escape.  It was kept until the injured limb had recovered, and\r\nwas then sent to his friend, the M.F.H.  The writer’s own recollections\r\nof fox-hunting go back to the days of the famous Jack Musters, the Squire\r\nof Colwick and Annesley, who married Mary Chaworth, the object of Lord\r\nByron’s passionate admiration.  Sometime in the forties he hunted our own\r\nSouth Wold country.  He was indeed “a character.”  Though said by the\r\nPrince Regent to be “the most perfect gentleman he had ever met,” yet, in\r\nthe hunting field, his language and his actions were most violent.  The\r\nwriter has still clearly impressed on his memory an occasion at Woodhall,\r\nwhen, as a boy of 12 years old, mounted on a small pony, and with the\r\nhounds running hard, he endeavoured to open a gate for the impatient\r\nM.F.H., and, on his not being able to accomplish this quickly enough, he\r\nwas assailed with such a flood of invective, and torrent of oaths, that\r\nhe was forced to withdraw from the attempt in confusion and bewilderment.\r\nBut, if the sportsman who crossed his path was not spared by “Jack,” as\r\nhe was familiarly called, neither was any unfortunate hound which\r\noffended him.  On one occasion, a young hound, at High-hall Wood, near\r\nWoodhall, was guilty of chasing a hare.  The whole “field” was in\r\nconsequence pulled up; one of the whips was ordered to bring the\r\ndelinquent forward.  The thong of his hunting crop was twisted round the\r\nhound’s neck, and while he on foot held the poor brute in this way, the\r\nother whip dismounted and belaboured it with his whip until he was\r\nhimself too exhausted to flog any more.  The whole field were kept\r\nlooking on at this display of wholesome (?) discipline, and when it was\r\nover the hound was left lying on the ground, almost strangled and a mass\r\nof contused weals, to recover its consciousness and limp after the\r\ndeparting pack, as best it could.  The painful impression made upon the\r\nyoung mind of one devoted to animals, and tender of their feelings,\r\nremains still as an unpleasant memory, from which it recoils.\r\n\r\nAt one of our meets, a fox was found in Bracken Wood, which, after giving\r\nus a good run round the neighbourhood, eventually took refuge in a\r\ncottage near High-hall Wood.  Entering by the open door, it mounted the\r\nladder which formed the staircase to the one bedroom above; there it\r\ncrept under the bed.  The hounds hunted all round the premises, but the\r\ndoor having been shut by the occupier, an aged, retired keeper, and there\r\nbeing a strong wind which blew the scent from the door, his retreat was\r\nnot discovered.  He remained in this place of concealment until the\r\nhounds had gone to a safe distance, and then, descending by the ladder,\r\nbolted out of the door and made off, verifying the adage of Erasmus\r\n(older than “Hudibras”),\r\n\r\n    That same that runnith a awaie\r\n    Againe maie fighte ane other daie.\r\n\r\nThe well-known cunning of the fox is shewn in the following:—A favourite\r\n“find” for many yeans has been Thornton Wood, some three miles from\r\nWoodhall Spa; and a frequent line for the fox to take was (and is) from\r\nthat covert to Holme Wood, near Scrivelsby.  To accomplish this the\r\nHorncastle Canal and the small river Bain have to be crossed.  The\r\nwriter, as a boy, has swum the canal on his pony, at the tail of the\r\npack; but usually riders have to make a detour by a bridge, between the\r\nfirst and second locks on the canal.  During the intervals of ten minutes\r\nor a quarter of an hour required for this, the hounds are left to\r\nthemselves.  It happened on two or three occasions that in this interval\r\nthe scent suddenly failed, and the fox was lost; casts were made up and\r\ndown the river, but without success.  On one occasion, a labourer,\r\nworking in the grass field between the canal and the Bain, saw the fox\r\ncross the canal by the lock doors, over which there was a narrow\r\nplank-bridge for foot-passengers.  It then made across the field for the\r\nBain.  He saw it pass out of sight down the banks of the river, close by\r\na willow tree, overhanging the water; but it did not emerge on the other\r\nside.  With the lack of quick wit, characteristic of the clod-hopper, it\r\ndid not occur to him to mention this at the time.  He told it, however,\r\nafterwards to his master, a hunting man; and, on a subsequent occasion,\r\nwhen the same incident occurred again, one of the whips dismounted and\r\nwent into the water, and, poking about the roots of the willows,\r\ndislodged Reynard, concealed under the hollow bank, and immersed under\r\nwater, except his nose and mouth, by which he was hanging suspended from\r\na fang of the tree roots.  Surely Reynard’s clever ruse deserved a better\r\nfate than the death which speedily followed.\r\n\r\nThe following incident occurred under my own observation.  I was out\r\nshooting in Woodhall.  In a certain field I had put up a hare, which went\r\naway, without a shot.  Passing, in due course, to the next field, I\r\nobserved an object sitting, so far as I could make out, in a crouching\r\nposition, in the middle of the field, and it looked in the distance like\r\na man.  I proceeded towards it, and soon perceived that it was a fox,\r\nsitting up on his hindquarters.  At this moment a hare, presumably that\r\nwhich I had put up just before, entered the field and cantered leisurely\r\nin the direction of the fox.  As sportsmen are aware, the hare, though\r\nable to see behind it, or on either side, does not, from the peculiar\r\nposition of the eyes, see so well straight in front.  In this case, the\r\nhare never perceived the fox until it was within a few feet of it;\r\nwhereupon it stopped short, and the two sat up facing each other,\r\nevidently mutually fascinated, as the bird is said to be by the snake.\r\nThey thus remained motionless, or powerless to move, for some minutes,\r\nuntil my nearer approach attracted their attention and broke the spell,\r\nwhereupon they both bounded off in different directions.  This, I am told\r\nby an authority, was a case of neurasthenia, or nerve-paralysis.  A not\r\nquite similar occurrence was recorded some little time ago.  A farmer saw\r\na pheasant go to roost in a tree, standing alone in the field.  Presently\r\nhe saw a fox approach, go to the tree, and look up at the pheasant.\r\nAfter pausing for a moment, regarding the bird, he proceeded to run\r\nrapidly round the tree in a narrow circle.  This he did for some time,\r\ncontinuing his circuit without intermission; when, to the farmer’s\r\nastonishment, the pheasant fell from its roost, and before it reached the\r\nground was seized by the fox, who went off with his prey to a\r\nneighbouring plantation.  This would seem to have been a case of\r\nhypnotism, rather than neurasthenia.  The bird was mesmerised, or made\r\ngiddy, by the fox’s circular motion, and literally fell into the\r\noperator’s arms.—(“Spectator,” January, 1898).  The writer, when\r\ntravelling in Germany, once met a German gentleman, who had visited\r\ncountry houses in England, and had conceived a great admiration for the\r\nEnglish sport of fox-hunting.  “Ah,” he said, “we have nothing like it in\r\nGermany.  It is a grand institution.  It makes you good horsemen, good\r\nsoldiers, good judges of country and distance.”  To those who would\r\nobject to fox-hunting on the score of its cruelty, I would quote words\r\nused at a church congress, by Colonel Hornby, master of the Devon and\r\nSomerset Staghounds.  Speaking on “The Ethics of Amusements,” he said:\r\n“The exercise of hunting is productive of the most beneficial effects on\r\nboth mind and body.  There could be no hunting without suffering to the\r\nanimal hunted, but this was greatly exaggerated.  These animals were born\r\nto be hunted by other wild animals; we had destroyed the latter, and our\r\nhunting was more merciful.  The pain inflicted was no equivalent to the\r\npleasure afforded to hounds and horses, leaving men out of the question.\r\nThe true lover of sport was a lover of mercy as well.  Every sportsman,\r\nin the true sense of the word, did all in his power to lessen the\r\nsuffering.”—Quoted, “Guardian,” Oct. 17, 1894, p. 1,620.\r\n\r\nThe days are gone by when gentlemen “of the cloth” were common in the\r\nhunting field.  Yet I have known some of the hardest working clergymen,\r\nand the most sincere, earnest Christians, who saw no excessive cruelty in\r\nthe chase.  We have no “Jack Russels” among us now; the last of the type\r\nwho lived in our neighbourhood found a dead fox in his pulpit, when he\r\nascended it to preach his sermon one Sunday morning; and though he did\r\nnot deliver a funeral oration over it, it was said that he buried it with\r\nas much loving reverence and genuine grief, as if it had been a Christian\r\nparishioner.\r\n\r\nA meet of the foxhounds at that favourite tryst, the “Tower on the Moor,”\r\nnear to Woodhall Spa, presents a pretty and lively scene.  Besides the\r\nred-coated sportsman, there are riders, with horses of every degree, from\r\nthe barebacked, or rudely saddled “screw,” to the 100 guinea or 200\r\nguinea hunter; and from the “weedy” hack to the long, elastic-legged\r\nanimal of racing blood.  There are numerous vehicles, two-wheeled and\r\nfour-wheeled, with their varied occupants, from the butcher’s light cart\r\nto the phaeton or the drag.  There are numbers on foot, of both sexes;\r\nsome of the men, staid of mein and beyond middle life, have already\r\nwalked their miles; townsmen, for once, breaking away from their trade,\r\nor their business, and bent once more on breathing the fresh air on the\r\nheather, and listening again to the “echoing horn,” as it vibrates\r\nthrough the woods.  There are ladies, on horseback, eager for the burst\r\nacross country “in the first flight”; there are ladies on cycles, not yet\r\narrived at the degree of perfection to enable the fair riders to take a\r\n“bee-line,” but yet, from the speed attainable, able to make rapid\r\ndetours, and if they study the wind, and are familiar with the “lay” of\r\nthe country, likely to see almost as much of the sport as the\r\nbest-mounted.  All are bent on the healthy enjoyment of this thoroughly\r\nEnglish pastime.  Their thoughts might find echo in the old hunting song,\r\n\r\n    Tally-ho!  Tally-ho!\r\n    Let the foreigner know\r\n    We are Englishmen: so,\r\n    Tally-ho!  Tally-ho!\r\n\r\nAnd who shall say that the pleasure is confined to them?  Someone has\r\nsaid: “The horses enjoy it, the hounds enjoy it, and no one can say from\r\nexperience that the fox does not enjoy it as well.”  Then comes the\r\nM.F.H., with his beauties, all in “the pink” of condition.  A moment’s\r\ndelay for pleasant greetings between all and sundry, and the hounds are\r\nquickly thrown in for business; their tails, and little more, wave above\r\nthe long ling and the tall bracken.  The whips gallop to their points of\r\nobservation.  Presently a whimper or two is heard; then the deeper tone\r\nof an old hound takes it up; the rest rally about him, and soon the whole\r\npack join in full chorus.  A halloo is heard from a ride, as the fox\r\ncrosses it; a distant hat is held up to show the line he is taking in the\r\ncover, and then a more distant shout of “gone away,” and the whole field\r\nare off, helter skelter, as though riding for their lives, _sauve qui\r\npeut_.  Such are “the pleasures of the chase,” for which we are indebted\r\nto the Little Red Rover: “The sport of kings, the image of war, without\r\nits guilt.”  (Somerville, “The Chase,” Book I.)\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Woodhall combines lands of a wild unreclaimed\r\nnature, such as the Ostler Ground and other moorlands, in the parishes of\r\nThornton, Martin, Roughton, Kirkby and Tattershall, and closely\r\ncontiguous, and even mixed up with these, lands which are in an advanced\r\nstate of cultivation.  I have already mentioned a tract of waste, boggy\r\nground, lying between the Tower on the Moor and Bracken Wood, formerly\r\nthe haunt of wild fowl, and still called “The Bogs Neuk.”  The origin of\r\nthis ground was probably the following:—The old antiquary, Leland,\r\nwriting of “The Tower,” {61} says, “one of the Cromwelles builded a\r\npretty turret, caullid the Tower on the Moore, and thereby he made a\r\nfaire greate pond or lake, bricked about.  The lake is commonly called\r\nthe Synkker.”  This “lake,” and all trace of it, have entirely\r\ndisappeared; but it is probable that the decay of its “bricked” walls, or\r\nof whatever the environment may really have been, led to the escape of\r\nthe water, and the creation of the tract of swamp, which remained until\r\nrecent years.  Similarly the Ostler Ground was, within the writer’s\r\nrecollection, a much wilder tract, and its woods more extensive than at\r\npresent.  Some 300 acres of wood were destroyed by fire, through\r\naccident, about the year 1847.  This happened at night, and, seen from a\r\ndistance, it looked like a vast American prairie conflagration, the\r\nheavens being tinged with a lurid light far and wide.  At that time the\r\nplantations opposite the Tower were of Scotch fir, so dense that the rays\r\nof the sun could scarcely penetrate.  The roads, as I have previously\r\nstated, were little more than cart tracts, often shifting; and the whole\r\ntract was almost as little frequented, or disturbed, as if it had been in\r\nthe heart of the Black Forest of Germany.  In the centre of this wild\r\nwere two or three fields belonging to another property, {62a} where\r\nroamed a herd of small, shaggy cattle, which, shut out as they were from\r\nthe rest of the world, became almost wild; and when, on occasions, the\r\nfoxhounds penetrated to their haunts, they frantically broke through all\r\nbounds, and for some days afterwards would be found scattered about the\r\nopen country around.  This tract of wood and moor has been for many years\r\nthe prettiest bit of wild shooting anywhere in this neighbourhood for\r\nmany miles round.  There is not, at the present time, anything like the\r\namount of game upon it which was to be found only a few years ago;\r\ndrainage and several very dry seasons, as also two or three accidental\r\nfires, having killed much of the ling, and reduced very considerably the\r\namount of cover.  Still, to the genuine sportsman who thinks more of a\r\nvaried bag than of the slaughter of numbers, it affords great\r\nattractions, and the writer has enjoyed many a happy day of healthy\r\nrelaxation, with dog and gun, upon it. {62b}  The variety of birds now,\r\nor formerly, to be seen, have been described already.  The ground game\r\nupon it now, apart from the fox, are the hares and rabbits; of these I\r\nshall speak more at length presently.  If the Moor ground has afforded\r\nfair sport of a wild and varied character, the shooting in the adjoining\r\ndomain of Kirkstead, in hares and partridges, has been also much superior\r\nto the rest of the neighbourhood, with the one exception of Tattershall,\r\nwhich has been nearly as good.  On one occasion, being one of a party of\r\nfive, the writer was stationed at the north-east corner of “The Arbours\r\nWood,” in Kirkstead, to shoot the hares which passed that point, while\r\nthe rest of the sportsmen walked the wood with the beaters.  In the space\r\nof about one hour and a quarter, without moving from his position, he\r\nshot 56 hares.  At one moment he had 16 hares lying dead before him; and\r\nhe could have shot many more, but that, from the rapid firing, his gun\r\nbarrels became, at times, so hot that he was afraid to load, and the\r\nhares were allowed to pass him, and escape unmolested. {63}\r\n\r\nWe occasionally find on the Ostler Ground an unusual hybrid between hare\r\nand rabbit, a notice of which may be of some interest to the naturalist.\r\nAs its occurrence has led to a good deal of correspondence, I will give\r\nhere a summary of the observations made upon it as they were stated by me\r\nat a meeting of the Lincolnshire Naturalists’ Union.  Among other persons\r\nwho made enquiry about it was Mr. Walter Heape, of Cambridge, who has\r\nmade the subject of hybrids a special study.  He asked my reasons for\r\nsupposing the animal to be such a cross.  My reply was as follows:—\r\n\r\n(1)  The animal is the size of a hare.\r\n\r\n(2)  Its fur is the rabbit grey.\r\n\r\n(3)  The head is the shorter, and the ears the more pricked and shorter,\r\nof the rabbit.\r\n\r\n(4)  One which I shot at, and missed in the ling, bolted straight for a\r\nhole, as though accustomed to it, and I never knew a hare to go to ground\r\nin that ready way.\r\n\r\n(5)  A tradition has long attached to the Moor that the hare and rabbit\r\ndo occasionally inter-breed.\r\n\r\nMr. Heape replied:—“I am aware that many naturalists deny that hares and\r\nrabbits will breed together.  I am not, however, myself of that opinion,\r\nbut I never had satisfactory proof of such a cross occurring.”  Further\r\nenquiry led to the following facts:—In the year 1773 the Abbe Domenico\r\nGagliari got two litters from a female hare by a male rabbit.  Richard\r\nThursfield also got hybrid’s of these two species.  M. Roux, in 1847,\r\nestablished a breed of “Leporides” in Angonleme, where he bred largely\r\nhybrids of hares and rabbits, and these hybrids were fertile with both\r\nparent species and among themselves.  Baron de Gleichen states that at\r\nHoching, Canton de la Prusse, Polonaise, hybrids of hare (female), and\r\nrabbits (male) are generally known.  He says, however, that M. Brocca,\r\nthe French savant, states that there are anatomical differences between\r\nhare and rabbit which make it, antecedently, improbable that they should\r\ninter-breed.  I have myself shot three of these hybrids on the Ostler\r\nGround, and have one of them stuffed.  In the year 1897 Sir Henry Hawley\r\nshot a similar specimen in Haltham Wood, some five miles from Woodhall;\r\nmore recently (Oct. 4th, 1898), the Rev. C. E. Chapman, then rector of\r\nScrivelsby, shot another in New York Fen; one was occasionally seen on\r\nthe Ostler Ground in 1898, and one was mentioned in “Land and Water,”\r\nMarch 5, 1892, as having been shot on the Moors, at Parkend, in\r\nNorthumberland.  I may add that a cross between a rabbit and guinea pig\r\nis in the possession of a person at Horncastle; and I have lately heard\r\nof a cross between black game and the capercailzie in Scotland.  But the\r\nfollowing somewhat analogous cases have created special interest.\r\nProfessor Ewart, of Edinburgh, has bred a cross between a male Berchell’s\r\nzebra and a mare pony, of the Isle of Rum breed, half wild, lent for the\r\nexperiment by Lord Arthur Cecil.  The pony was jet black; the foal\r\nresulting, except over the hind quarters, had as many stripes as the\r\nzebra sire, the stripes being fawn colour, with background nearly black.\r\nIn form it closely resembled a well-bred foal.  As another interesting\r\ncase of a similar kind, Lord Morton has bred a cross between a male\r\nquagga and a nearly pure-bred Arab mare; and Lord Tankerville has, more\r\nthan once, bred a cross between the famous wild Chillingham bull (Bos\r\nUrus Primigenius) and a shorthorn cow.\r\n\r\nAn interesting variety of the hare is also found in Woodhall and the\r\nneighbourhood.  This is the albino or white hare.  Some 30 or more years\r\nago one was frequently seen in the parishes of Langton and Woodhall, and\r\neventually was shot in Thimbleby.  They were then, so far as the writer\r\nknows, in abeyance for some years.  But within the last decade heredity\r\nhas asserted itself, and they have reappeared in increased numbers, and\r\nwould doubtless become an established variety if allowed to multiply.  In\r\nSeptember, 1894, one of the Woodhall tenants killed, in the harvest\r\nfield, a three-quarter-grown white leveret.  In 1896 the writer presented\r\nto the Natural History Museum, at Lincoln, a fine albino specimen, also\r\nshot in Woodhall, with two small white leverets, accidentally killed in\r\nthe harvest field at Langton.  Since then, attention having been drawn to\r\ntheir existence, a number of instances occurring in the neighbourhood\r\nhave been recorded.  One was shot at Ranby as far back as Oct. 19, 1860;\r\ntwo were seen in Clayworth in 1896; one was shot in Baumber, Sept. 17,\r\n1896; one shot at Thorpe Tilney, in Timberland parish, with slight tinge\r\nof brown on the ears, October, 1897; one shot in Timberland in 1895; one\r\nbeing seen still at large in Thorne Tilney in May, 1898; one shot in\r\nBranston, September, 1895, half grown; two shot at Bracebridge in 1893 or\r\n1894; one shot in Wispington in 1896. {65}  On one occasion, when\r\nshooting in Kirkstead, the writer shot (right and left) a couple of hares\r\nwith white face and forelegs, one of which he has stuffed.\r\n\r\nWe commonly speak of the cunning of the fox, but Mr. E. A. Pease, M.P.,\r\nin his recent book, “Hunting Reminiscences” (Thacker & Co., 1895, p.\r\n119), says: “The hare is really a much more rusé animal than the fox; can\r\nsteal better away, and, once started, there is no end to her wiles and\r\ndodges.”  Of this cunning, with a view to self-preservation, I can give\r\ninstances.  It has been maintained that hares never take to water, but a\r\ncorrespondence was carried on in the newspaper a few years ago (see\r\n“Morning Post,” Nov. 14, 1892), in which instances were given of their\r\ndoing so.  I have myself seen a hare, which has eluded the greyhounds,\r\nswim across a moat, almost surrounding the house in which I am writing;\r\nand then steal away to the cover of some large ferns in a sheltered nook\r\nin the garden.  Some years ago a baronet visited a relative of mine in\r\nthis neighborhood, and brought with him a pack of beagles.  We used to\r\nrun on foot after these in pursuit of hares.  It is known that a hare,\r\nwhen getting exhausted, has not the strong scent of one just started.  As\r\nwe ran over a rough ploughed field, I have seen a hare, when nearly tired\r\nout, thrust another sitting hare out of her “form,” and take her place.\r\nThe pack of beagles passed over the worn-out hare squatting in the\r\nfurrow, and rushed forward with a fresh burst of music in their rich deep\r\ntones, on the strong scent of the hare just set on foot.  I passed the\r\nsquatting hare, but had not the heart to betray her, feeling that she\r\ndeserved to reap the reward of her cleverness.  When hunted by harriers,\r\nhares often “double” on their track, and so throw the hounds out.  I here\r\ngive a very clever instance of this, which I myself once witnessed.  On\r\none occasion, sitting on the South Downs, watching the movements of a\r\npack of harriers in the distance, I saw “puss” gradually approaching me.\r\nIn a hilly country like the Downs, a hare, from the great length and\r\npropelling power of her hind legs, gains considerably upon the pack in\r\nrunning up hill, and loses ground in a descent.  The hare in question had\r\njust descended a steep Down side, the hounds gaining rapidly upon her.\r\nIt was what may be termed “a squeak” for her life, when, in the “dean”\r\nbelow, {67} she reached, just in time, the shelter of a clump of gorse.\r\nWorking her way through this, she stole out on the opposite side to the\r\npack, and at a tremendous pace faced the hill, near the top of which I\r\nwas sitting, by a chalk quarry.  In the ascent she distanced the hounds\r\nonce more, but she was getting done, and, in the gentle breeze which\r\nfloated towards me, I distinctly heard her panting as she bounded upward.\r\nBut here her instinctive cunning came into play.  The hill top was a few\r\nfeet above me, some twenty yards away.  I sat motionless, and, in her\r\nanxiety about her pursuers, she never observed me.  She passed me,\r\nbreathing heavily, and sprang along as far as the hill top; there, just\r\nat the brow, she paused, then cantered forward a few yards, returned, and\r\nrepeated this more than once.  Then, turning suddenly towards me, she\r\nmade four or five huge bounds, only just touching the ground, and dropped\r\ninto the chalk quarry a few feet below me, and crept under the shelter of\r\nsome dwarf thorn bushes.  Her object was manifest.  By passing more than\r\nonce over her own tracks, on the hill top, she created a strong scent,\r\nwhich the breeze, just catching it at the brow, would carry further\r\nforward.  By her leaps towards the quarry, she had left but a slight\r\nscent, and under those thorn bushes she was doubtless waiting tremblingly\r\nthe result of her ruse.  I remained motionless, watching the issue.  The\r\npack came somewhat laboriously up the hill side, keeping close to the\r\nline she had taken; and a pretty sight it was, as a large sheet would\r\nalmost have covered them, as they held on compactly together.  They\r\npassed, as the hare had done, within a few yards of the chalk quarry;\r\npressed on to the brow of the hill, and thence followed the scent which\r\nhad been blown on beyond it.  Presently there was a check, and the music\r\nceased.  The master never thought of “harking back,” his pack having\r\nfollowed a strong scent beyond the brow; but pushed on to a spinney lying\r\non the slope of the next “dean.”  I sat for a time longer by the quarry,\r\nand presently I saw puss, having recovered her breath, emerge from her\r\nhiding place and steal away, bent, doubtless, on reaching some distant\r\nsecure retreat before her limbs became stiff from the unwonted exertion.\r\n\r\nI have known a hare, when hard pressed by the harriers, enter a tunnel\r\nunder a field gateway; but here instinct rather fails her; for, too\r\noften, it is only avoiding one mode of death by courting another.  If\r\nthere is water in the ditch, running through the tunnel, the obstruction\r\ncaused by her body makes the water rise, and she is drowned; or, if she\r\nstays any time in the tunnel, her cramped limbs get so stiff after her\r\nexertions, that she cannot get out.\r\n\r\nThere is one kind of foe which the hare finds more difficult to shake\r\noff, or elude, than a pack of harriers or beagles.  Stoats, foumarts,\r\npolecats, _et id genus omne_, are becoming scarcer every year; although\r\nthe writer was recently told of a marten-cat—probably the Pine-marten\r\n(martes abietum)—being killed in a tree, and sold for 10s. as a rarity.\r\nI was a witness of the following:—Walking, in the small hours of the\r\nmorning, in a parish contiguous to Woodhall, on my way to a stream where\r\nI was going to fish, I saw a hare in a field adjoining the road, which\r\nwas leaping about in a most extraordinary fashion, starting hither and\r\nthither, plunging into the rushes, springing into the air, and performing\r\nall sorts of strange antics, which I could only account for, had she been\r\n“as mad as a March hare,” as the saying is; but this was in the month of\r\nMay.  Presently she rushed forward, occasionally leaping into the air,\r\ntowards the fence which separated me from the fields.  I expected to see\r\nher appear through the hedge, in front of me; but she did not come.  Out\r\nof curiosity I got over the fence, when I saw the hare lying, a few yards\r\nfurther on, stretched out as though dead.  I went up to her, and found\r\nthat she was, indeed, quite dead; and fast on her neck was a weasel, so\r\ngorged with her blood, that its usually slender body was quite bloated.\r\nFollowing the proverbial national instinct, I killed the weasel; carried\r\nthe hare to a footpath, and left it there, that some labourer passing by\r\nmight take it home to regale his family.\r\n\r\nThis incident leads me to speak of the pertinacity of our weasels in\r\nhunting their prey, say a hare, as above, or a rabbit.  On one occasion,\r\nas I was riding by the side of a strip of low whinbushes and long grass,\r\na rabbit rushed out just in front of me, its fur apparently curled with\r\nperspiration, uttering a kind of suppressed cry, and evidently in a state\r\nof the greatest terror.  I pulled up in order to discover the cause of\r\nthis alarm.  The rabbit re-entered the cover a few yards further on; but\r\npresently, where it had emerged, I saw a weasel; and then I became aware\r\nthat a number of these creatures were working through the grass.  I\r\nwatched their movements, following them at a distance, till they had\r\nabout reached the spot where the rabbit re-entered.  Then, feeling a keen\r\nsympathy for the poor persecuted rabbit, I charged into the midst of the\r\npack, and by dint of plunging up and down among the startled company, and\r\nstriking at them with my whip, I succeeded in dispersing them.  At the\r\nsame moment the rabbit, which had no doubt been crouching near, half\r\nparalysed with fear, darted out, and passing by me, went away at a great\r\npace, as if rejoicing in the rescue.  I pursued the weasels for some\r\ndistance, and should say there was not less than a dozen.  I was much\r\nastonished at the enormous leaps which they made in their flight, their\r\nlong, lithe bodies contracting, and then expanding with a sudden jerk\r\nwhich threw them forward several feet at a time.  As to the habit of\r\nweasels hunting in a pack, Waterton, the naturalist, mentions that he has\r\nseen two old stoats with five half-grown young ones hunting together.\r\n{69}  Richard Jefferies, in his book, “Round about a Great Estate,”\r\nmentions having seen a pack of five stoats hunting in company, and says\r\nthat a poacher told him that he had seen as many as fourteen so engaged.\r\nIn the above case, which came under my own observation, the weasels were\r\nall apparently full grown and equally agile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.  REPTILES, FISHES, INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalking along the path through the wood, from the cross roads, near St.\r\nAndrew’s Church, towards the Victoria Hotel, the writer, on one occasion,\r\nobserved a lady poking with her parasol at some object lying on the\r\nground close to her feet.  On coming to the spot he found that she was\r\nplaying with an adder, which had crossed her path, apparently quite\r\ninnocent of the danger she was incurring, the serpent still, evidently,\r\nhaving some attractive power for this, too curious daughter of Eve.  He\r\nat once, by a blow on the head with his walking stick, despatched it, and\r\nthen explained to her that it was lucky for her that it had not bitten\r\nher on the ankle.  The adder or viper (Vipera Berus) is, fortunately, not\r\ncommon about Woodhall, but it exists there, and may be seen at times,\r\nbasking on a sunny bank, or lying among the dead and dry foliage near a\r\npath, or on the open heath, where the unwary pedestrian is liable to\r\ntread upon it.  It is the more dangerous because it is apt to vary in\r\ncolour, according to the locality which it frequents, and therefore is\r\nthe less easily observed.  The colour is always some shade of brown, from\r\na dull yellow to an olive tint; but it may be specially known by the\r\nzigzag, black markings along the back, and its broad head, with V-shaped\r\nmark in the centre.  Its length is from a foot to a foot-and-a-half,\r\nalthough specimens have been killed as long as four feet.  (“Naturalist,”\r\n1895, p. 206.)  The female is larger than the male.  Its bite is made\r\nwith great rapidity, so that there is little opportunity to escape it.\r\nThe poison is very virulent, and we are told that in some cases it has\r\nproved fatal, but that was probably in the case of a naturally\r\ninflammatory subject.  The writer has killed several at different times,\r\non the Moor, near Woodhall.  On one occasion, on a hot day in September,\r\nwhen a friend was shooting with him, the dog of the friend was bitten.\r\nIt immediately howled, and seemed to be in considerable pain.  He was in\r\ntime to see the adder and to kill it.  He then hurried off with the dog\r\nand caught a train to Horncastle, where a dose of Eau de Luce was\r\nadministered, and the dog recovered.  Olive oil, also, well rubbed into\r\nthe bitten part, is said to be an effective remedy, and is often more\r\neasily obtainable.  Another variety of snake found here is what is\r\ncommonly called the “slow worm” or “blind worm” (Anguis fragilis), which\r\nis generally seen in moist meadow ground.  It is from 10 to 16 inches in\r\nlength, and quite harmless.  Strictly speaking, it is a lizard, not a\r\nsnake.  The only other kind is the common grass snake (coluber natrix).\r\nThis is fairly common.  The writer has seen three linked together, lying\r\non a bank in Kirkby-lane, a favourite walk near Woodhall.  If taken\r\nunawares, without time to escape, it will hiss and make a show of fight,\r\nbut it is perfectly harmless and defenceless, and usually endeavours to\r\nescape as quickly as possible, and will bury itself in the long grass,\r\nthe hedge bottom, or underground with marvellous rapidity.  Like the late\r\nPoet Laureate, Lord Tennyson, the writer has more than once kept a tame\r\nsnake of this species, and has even carried it about in his coat pocket,\r\nto the astonishment of urchins who have seen its head peeping out.  In a\r\nstate of nature they hybernate; but when kept in a room, a favourite\r\nresort in cold weather was among the ashes under a fire-grate.  If a hot\r\ncoal fell from the grate into the ashes, the snake would rush out\r\nhissing, but presently return to its warm retreat again.  Held out by the\r\ntail, they will try to climb up their own body, and snap, as if to bite\r\nat one’s hand; but their only real mode of defence is to inflate the body\r\nwith air to its utmost power of expansion, and then emit it again,\r\ncharged with a strong odour, repulsive enough to drive most things from\r\nit. {71a}  They are found in length from one foot and a half to three\r\nfeet; and the writer has seen one killed, from which 32 unhatched eggs\r\nwere taken, each egg about an inch long.  The question of snakes\r\nswallowing their young, to shelter them from danger, though asserted by\r\nseveral authorities, I have never been able to prove or disprove,\r\nalthough I have often watched them. {71b}\r\n\r\nThe Lizard (Zoctoca vivipara) is found in sandy parts of the moor, and\r\nsunny banks, but is not very common.  Many a time, as a boy, I have\r\ncaught it, and found, immediately afterwards, nothing left in my hand but\r\nthe tail, the rest of the creature darting away over the ground, as if\r\nnone the worse; or, rather, as one might imagine, moving more freely when\r\nrelieved of the incumbrance.  This “casting” of the tail would seem,\r\nreally, to be an interesting, self-protective effort.  As the partridge\r\nshams lameness in its movements, to draw away an intruder from its young;\r\nor, conversely, as the Russian traveller, pursued by wolves, flings away\r\nhis children, that he may escape himself; so the captured lizard, as a\r\nlast resource, casts off its tail, and leaves it, wriggling, to attract\r\nthe captor’s attention, while its own bodily “better half” seeks safety\r\nin concealment.\r\n\r\nIn the ponds at Woodhall the crested newt (Triton cristatus) and the\r\nsmooth newt (Triton punctatus) were found by members of the Lincolnshire\r\nNaturalists’ Union, on their visit in August, 1893.\r\n\r\nOf the fishes of our neighbourhood I have been furnished with the\r\nfollowing list by the greatest local authority, who has inherited, and\r\npersonally acquired, an intimate knowledge of the subject:—Trout (Salmo\r\nfario), river Bain; grayling (Thymallus vulgaris), Bain; pike (Esox\r\nlucius), canal, ponds, Witham; chub (Leuciscus cephalus), Bain; carp\r\n(Cyprinus carpio), ponds—rarely in Witham; rudd (Cyprinus\r\nErythrophthalmus), Witham; bream (Abramis Brama), Witham; silver bream\r\n(Abramis Blicca), ponds; roach (Leuciscus rutilus), ponds, canals, Bain;\r\ndace (Leuciscus vulgaris), ponds, canal, Bain; blick (Alburnus lucidus),\r\nWitham; minnow (Leuciscus Phoxinus), Bain; tench, (Tinca vulgaris),\r\nponds; perch (Perca fluviatilis), canal; loach (Nemachilus barbatulus),\r\ncanal and river Waring; gudgeon (Gobio fluviatilis), canal, Bain, Waring,\r\nWitham; miller’s thumb (Gobio cottus), canal; stickleback or blue-eyed\r\nsailor (Gasterosteus aculeatus), Waring and ponds; lampern, or lamprey,\r\nor nine-eyed eel (Pteromyzon fluviatilis), Bain and Waring; burbot (Gadus\r\nlota), Witham; eel (Anguilla vulgaris), Witham, Bain, and ponds.\r\n\r\nOn some of these fishes I may here make a few remarks.  The grayling,\r\n“Thymellus,” or “thyme scented” fish, is not indigenous, but has, of late\r\nyears, been imported from the small river Eau, at Claythorpe, near\r\nAlford; and it is now breeding in the river Bain.  It is also called the\r\n“umber,” or “shadow” fish, because it does not lie near the surface, like\r\nthe trout, but deeper down, and darts up at the fly, like a grey, dim\r\nshadow in the water.  A recent angling author, referring to this habit of\r\nthe fish, speaks of casting his fly “on the surface of a deep pool on the\r\nDoon, in which the shadowy form of the grayling could be seen three feet\r\nbelow.  A fish would shoot up with a rush, seize the fly, and drop\r\nbackward to the bottom.”  (“Angling Holidays,” by C. W. Gedney, pp. 8,\r\n9.)  The special month for grayling fishing is August, and onward through\r\nthe winter.  The rudd, found in the Witham, is not unlike the roach, but\r\na thicker fish, with sides and back almost of a green tinge.  It has been\r\ntaken up to 2½lb., but from 1 to 1½lb. is a commoner weight.  It acquires\r\nits name from its red (ruddy-coloured) eyes.  The blick is like the dace,\r\nbut smaller and lighter in colour; very quick in taking the fly.  Its\r\naverage size is four to five inches.  The stickleback, or “blue-eyed\r\nsailor,” is found almost everywhere—in pond and stream.  It is remarkable\r\nfor building a nest, almost like that of a bird, attached to the stem of\r\na reed or some other aquatic plant, which the male fish defends with\r\ngreat pugnacity “against all comers.”  It may be said to occupy a place\r\namong our fishes, analogous to that of the kingfisher among our birds, as\r\nbeing decked with brighter colours than any other kind; especially is\r\nthis the case in time of excitement, as when defending the nest.  It then\r\ndarts about, with all its spines erect, and flashing with green and gold\r\nand red.  Anyone who thrusts a stick into the water near the nest may\r\nwitness this for himself.  “Sticklebacks were formerly found in such\r\nlarge quantities in fen waters that they were made a source of\r\nconsiderable profit, being boiled down for the oil they contained, and\r\nthe refuse sold as manure.”  (Thompson’s “Boston,” p. 368.)  The miller’s\r\nthumb is about the size of a gudgeon, to which it is allied, but has a\r\nhead broader than its body, whence it gets its other name of “bull-head.”\r\nThe burbot has something of the flavour of the eel.  The lamprey gets its\r\nname of the “nine-eyed eel” from nine orifices along the side of the\r\nthroat, through which the water passes from the gills.  It is sometimes\r\nsaid to be poisonous, but the Germans eat them as a delicacy.  Carp, of\r\nthe “Lake” variety, were put into the Witham several years ago, and they\r\nare occasionally taken 10lb. or 12lb. in weight.  The ordinary pond carp\r\nis no longer known near Woodhall, but they survive in a pond, where the\r\nwriter has caught them, at Wispington.  They are a somewhat insipid fish,\r\nalthough at one time highly esteemed.  There was an old saying that the\r\n“carp was food fit for an abbot, the barbel for a king.”  Tench were\r\nfound in great numbers in a pond which formerly existed on the site now\r\noccupied by “Oranienhof” Villa, within 150 yards of the Victoria Hotel.\r\nThey have also been taken in the river Witham, but are now thought to be\r\nextinct.  Very large tench were formerly abundant in a moat surrounding\r\nthe house where the writer now lives.  They are difficult to take with\r\nworm or paste, as, by continual sucking, they get the bait off the hook\r\nwithout being caught.  The largest, sometimes weighing 3lb. or more, were\r\ntaken in a wickerwork trap, of the shape of a dice-box, some 3ft. long,\r\nwith the willow withes pointing inwards at each end.  This was baited\r\nwith a peony, or any gay-coloured flower; attracted by which, the tench\r\nfound their way inwards, but could not get out.  Every pond in Kirkstead\r\nhas its fish; fish doubtless of ancient lineage, the descendants of those\r\non which monks and abbotts once fattened.  In an early blackletter\r\nedition of Chaucer, there is a fragment of a poem, called “The Pilgrym’s\r\nTale,” which begins with these lines:—\r\n\r\n    In Lyncolneshyr, fast by the fene,\r\n    Ther stant an hows, and you yt ken.\r\n\r\n                                        Todd’s “Gower and Chaucer,” p. iv.\r\n\r\nwhich might well apply to the “hows,” or monastery, of Kirkstead.  Every\r\nsuch Religious House had its “fish stews,” or ponds, keeping, as Chaucer\r\nsays, “Many a bream, and many a luce (pike) in stew, and many a fat\r\npartrich eke in mewe.”  The Cistercian rules of diet were very severe,\r\nallowing only one meal a day, and none but the sickly were permitted to\r\npartake of animal food.  Consequently, fish were in great demand, and the\r\ngreater the variety, the more toothsome would be the monastic fare. {74}\r\nRoach abound in the Witham, and attain a very fair size, not unfrequently\r\nup to 1¼lb.; and the artizans of Sheffield, and elsewhere, brought by\r\nspecial trains, in hundreds, often carry away with them very fair\r\nbaskets.  Bream of both kinds are very abundant in the Witham.  I am told\r\nby one angler that he has seen the water crowded with shoals of them, and\r\nthey are caught up to 6lb. in weight, and even more.  I have before me\r\nthe paper-cut shape of a bream caught near Tattershall, which weighed\r\n5¼lb., was 21 inches in length, and about 20 inches in girth.  Chub in\r\nthe river Bain, between Horncastle and Roughton, and again between\r\nTattershall and Dogdyke, are caught weighing several pounds.  They are a\r\nwary fish, but, when hooked, fight hard for a while, and then suddenly\r\ncollapse.  The writer has often, in the early morning or late evening,\r\nsat by the river fishing for them with black slug, and seen two or three\r\nbig fish, 1½ft. in length, slowly rising and sinking in the stream, as\r\nthey examined the bait.  A chub was taken in the Bain, in 1898, with the\r\nspoon-bait, weighing 4lb. 10oz.  The Pike attains a good size in some of\r\nthe ponds in the neighbourhood, and also in the river Witham.  In a large\r\npond, about three-quarters of a mile from the Bath-house, at an abandoned\r\nbrickyard known as “Jordan’s Pond,” a near relative of the writer, a few\r\nyears ago, landed a pike weighing between 13lbs. and 14lbs.  It was\r\ncurrently reported for several years that there was a much larger pike in\r\nthis pond, which those who had seen it estimated at 20lbs. weight.  A\r\nresident near has told the writer that he has seen it, holding across its\r\njaws a captured fish fully a foot long.  This pike disappeared, it is\r\nbelieved in the night, in the year 1897.  Doubtless the nocturnal\r\nmarauder has kept his own counsel from that day to this.  There is an old\r\nlaconic expression, “Witham pike, none like,” which is only a condensed\r\nform of an older adage,\r\n\r\n    Ancholme eels, and Witham pike,\r\n    In all the world there’s none syke.\r\n\r\nThe pike of the Witham were evidently famed of yore, for Drayton, in his\r\nPolyolbion (Song XXV.), personifying the Witham, says:—\r\n\r\n    Thus to her proper song the burthen still she bare,\r\n    Yet for my dainty pikes I am beyond compare.\r\n\r\nWalter de Gaunt (A.D. 1115) granted to the Abbot of Bardney eight\r\nfisheries on the Witham, and a fishery on the Witham at Dogdyke\r\n(Dock-dike) was granted to the Abbot of Kirkstead by Philip de Kyme (A.D.\r\n1162), which were privileges, in those times, of considerable value.\r\n(Reliquiœ galenœ, Introd., p. xxiii.).  Records in the Archives of\r\nLincoln state that when Henry VII. visited Lincoln, in 1486, keeping his\r\nEaster there, and “humbly and christenly did wesh the feet of 30 poore\r\nmenne with his noble hands,” he was entertained at a banquet, to which\r\nthe Mayor contributed “12 grete pykes, 12 grete tenches, and 12 salmons”;\r\n{76a} and on a second visit, after his victory at Stoke field, the\r\nCorporation presented him with “2 fatte oxen, 20 fatte muttons, 12 fatte\r\ncapons, and 6 grete fatte pykes.”  “Pike have been taken in the Fens,”\r\nsays Mr. Skertchly, in his “Fenland” (p. 398), “from 20lbs. to 24lbs.\r\nThe largest known was taken when Whittlesea Mere was drained.  It weighed\r\n100lbs., and was given to the late naturalist, Frank Buckland.”  There\r\nare fine pike in the lake at Sturton Hall, where permission to fish may\r\ngenerally be obtained; and the present would seem to be an opportunity\r\nfor placing on record that when, early in this century, the lake, of some\r\neight acres in extent, was first formed by damming the stream which ran\r\nthrough the Park, it was stocked with pike and other fish from the moat\r\nwhich then enclosed the residence of the present writer, Langton Rectory.\r\nI find among my notes on Witham pike fishing, that in 1890 one angler\r\n{76b} took, in two hours, five fish, weighing altogether 31lbs.; the\r\nlargest scaling over a stone (14lbs.), measured 35½ inches in length and\r\n19 inches in girth.  A few days later he landed fishes of 7lbs. and\r\n5lbs., while another angler, about the same date, secured a pike of\r\n16lbs.  But a Horncastle fisherman, {76c} in the same week, captured one\r\nof 18lbs. in the Witham near Tattershall.  One of our greatest anglers\r\nstates that his largest pike, taken in the Witham, was 16¼lbs.; that he\r\nhas landed 23 pike in one day, of all sizes, and 20 the next day, making\r\n43 fish in two days.  In the closing week of the season 1898–1899, a\r\nseason below the average, a pike was taken in the Witham, near\r\nTattershall, weighing 22lbs.\r\n\r\nThe late vicar of Tattershall, the Rev. Mortimer Latham, to whose memory\r\nthe writer would here pay his tribute of regard and respect for as\r\ngenuine, and withal as genial, an angler as Isaac Walton himself, “knew,”\r\nas we might say, “by heart,” the Witham, its finny occupants, and their\r\nhaunts; and many a fine fish he landed, the shapes of which he kept, cut\r\nout in brown paper, in his study.  The largest pike he ever took weighed\r\n19½lbs.  I have before me, as I write, the paper-cut shape of this fish,\r\nlent to me by his daughter; who writes: “It may interest you to know that\r\nit was conveyed home in a bolster slip, and was on view in the vicarage\r\ncourtyard, to the great entertainment of the whole village.”  Its length\r\nwas 38 inches, girth about 21 inches.  She further adds: “My father, at\r\none time, caught several tench (now supposed to be extinct in the\r\nWitham), and I am proud to say that the last one known to be captured was\r\ntaken by myself, for being one of the keenest fishermen that even\r\nLincolnshire ever produced, he made us as ardent fisherfolk as himself.”\r\nI have also the shape of a perch caught by him, weighing 2½lbs., length\r\n15½ins., girth about 12ins.\r\n\r\nNo fish is so “coy and hard to please” as the pike.  Of them may be said,\r\nwhat someone has said of women,\r\n\r\n    If they will, they will,\r\n       You may depend on’t;\r\n    And if they won’t, they won’t;\r\n       And there’s an end on’t.\r\n\r\nThe proverbial “variabile semper” element is their characteristic\r\nfeature, a living illustration of a line, pregnant with meaning, of\r\nColeridge,\r\n\r\n    Naught may endure but mutability.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, a well-known angler tells me, he fished three long hours\r\nin a gale of wind, which nearly carried him into the river, without\r\nstirring a fin, and then, an unaccountable change of mood coming over the\r\n“water wolves,” through the next hour and a half they “took like mad,”\r\nand he landed 42½lb. weight.  At the time two Sheffield men were fishing\r\nclose by, who had been at the work for three days, and had landed only a\r\nfew bream or roach, and one small jack.  Under their very noses he landed\r\nthree splendid pike, while they looked on thunderstruck.  Such are the\r\nfortunes of war with fishermen.  On another occasion, when the day was\r\ndull and calm, and there was nothing, one would have thought, to stir the\r\nfish to any animation, he landed at the same spot one pike of 16¼lb., and\r\nthree of 9lb. odd each.  “In fact,” he says, “pike are unaccountable.”\r\nIn December, 1898, a boy caught a pike of 16lb. weight in the Horncastle\r\nCanal, at Tattershall, 3½ feet in length and 9 inches in girth; and\r\nanother of 11lbs. was taken in the Witham, shortly after; and other cases\r\nof 14lb., and so on, are recorded.  Pike, as is well known, are\r\nexceedingly voracious, and not very particular as to what they eat.  A\r\nwriter in the “Naturalist” {78} states that a pair of Shoveller ducks\r\nnested in a disused brickpit, and brought off their young; but a pike in\r\nthe pit gradually carried them off, one by one, taking one when it was\r\nlarge enough to fly.  The same fish destroyed nearly the whole of another\r\nbrood of ducks, hatched at the same pit.  The present writer has himself\r\nwitnessed a similar occurrence.  He at one time kept (as he does still)\r\nwild ducks, which nested on the banks of the moat surrounding the house.\r\nThere were large pike in the moat, and he has frequently heard a duck\r\ngive a quack of alarm, has seen a curl on the water, and on counting his\r\nducklings, found that there was one less.  And if pike are not particular\r\nas to their diet—all being grist that comes to the mill—neither are they\r\nparticular as to the bait, if _they are in the humour_.\r\n\r\nThe writer, in a day’s fishing for trout, in a Scotch river, the Teviot,\r\nwhere he took perhaps a score or two in the day, would vary the sport on\r\ncoming to a deep pool by taking off his flies, putting on stout gimp\r\ntackle, with a single large hook, which was run through the body of a\r\nsmall trout, or parr; and would often, in this way, land a good pike or\r\ntwo.  Sometimes when drawing in the pike too hastily, it would disgorge\r\nthe bait and hook, but on his making another cast, and letting them float\r\ndown the pool again, the pike would return to the charge, unwarned by\r\nexperience, and be eventually captured.  On one occasion, rowing\r\nleisurely in a boat on Loch Vennachar, with his rod over the stern, and\r\nline trailing behind him, a trout, of a pound weight or so, took the fly,\r\nand hooked itself.  This was immediately seized by a good-sized pike, and\r\nafter a hard fight he secured both with gut tackle.  Dining with the\r\nMarchioness who owned the above river, he was regaled on a 10lb. or 12lb.\r\npike, which the Lady Cecil had caught that day, her boat being pushed\r\nalong the river by a gillie, himself walking in the water, and she\r\nfishing with a single large hook, baited with a piece of red cloth.\r\n\r\nWe have quoted the lines celebrating the pike of the Witham, and the eels\r\nof the Ancholme (also a Lincolnshire river), but eels were, at one time,\r\nabundant also in the Witham.  Large tubs containing hundreds of them used\r\nto be taken to Horncastle on market days, or were hawked about to the\r\ncountry houses.  It is said that as many as 16,000 eels have been taken\r\nin one year.  If you bought eels from these hawkers, they were brought to\r\nyour kitchen door alive, and, being difficult creatures to handle, your\r\ncook generally got the seller to skin them alive, and they were often put\r\ninto the pan for stewing before they had ceased wriggling.  Hence the\r\nphrase to “get accustomed to a thing; as eels do to skinning.”  But an\r\neel can only be once skinned in its life, and even the skin, stript from\r\nits writhing body, was supposed to possess a “virtue.”  If tied round a\r\nleg or an arm, it was considered a remedy, or preventive, for rheumatism;\r\nand your cook would sometimes preserve the skin for a rheumatic friend.\r\nIn these days the eels brought to market are few, and not half the size\r\nthey used to be.  Eels, from 2ft. to 3ft. long, and as thick as one’s\r\nwrist, were formerly quite common.  Eels are supposed to migrate to the\r\nsea, and, in the year 1903, a large eel was found, early in the morning,\r\nabout 100 yards from a large pond, in the parish of Wispington,\r\ntravelling across a grass field, towards a stream, by which it might\r\neventually reach the sea.\r\n\r\nThe only other fish which I have to remark upon is the trout.  They are\r\nnot found in the Witham; but the Bain trout are handsome; both the\r\ngolden, or rich yellow kind, with pink spots, and the purple or\r\nmauve-coloured variety, but the former are much finer in flavour.  For\r\nsome years the swans on the Horncastle Canal made great havoc among the\r\nyoung trout and spawn {79a} in the neighbouring river Bain, but the last\r\nswan died in 1897.  Further, there is now an artificial breeding tank\r\nestablished at Horncastle, managed by Mr. Rushton, for keeping up the\r\nsupply.  Some very fine fish have been taken at different times.  My\r\nnotes record as follows:—In April, 1896, one of the anglers already\r\nreferred to {79b} caught a trout in the Bain, close to Horncastle,\r\nweighing 4lb. 6oz., 23in. in length.  The same fisherman, in July, 1888,\r\ntook another, within half a mile of the same place, weighing 4lb. 10oz.,\r\n23in. in length.  The son {79c} of a quondam veteran angler, and himself\r\none of our keenest fishermen, tells me that he, several years ago,\r\nassisted his father to land a male trout of 7lb. weight, from the\r\nwatermill pool at Horncastle.  It fought so hard that he and his brother\r\nhad to rush into the water and take it in their arms, their father’s\r\ntackle not being intended for such a monster. {80a}  This, however, was\r\nsurpassed by a trout taken by the late Mr. Robert Clitherow, of\r\nHorncastle, _a beau ideal_ disciple of the gentle craft, which weighed\r\n8lbs.\r\n\r\nProbably the handsomest trout in the neighbourhood, though not the\r\nlargest, are those of the Somersby “beck,” “The Brook,” rendered for ever\r\nclassical by the sweet poem of the late Poet Laureate.  In years gone by\r\nthe writer has enjoyed many a picnic on its banks, when we used to pull\r\noff our shoes and stockings, and turn up our trousers—gentlemen as well\r\nas boys—to catch the trout by the process called “tickling” them, while\r\nhiding in their holes; which the ladies afterwards cooked on a fire\r\nextemporised on the bank.  The music of the rippling stream haunts one\r\nstill, as one reads those liquid lines of the poet, themselves almost a\r\nrunnel:\r\n\r\n    I chatter over stony ways,\r\n       In little sharps and trebles;\r\n    I bubble into eddying bays,\r\n       I babble on the pebbles. {80b}\r\n\r\nTwenty-five or thirty years ago, the dykes in the Fens, near the Witham,\r\nabounded in fish of the coarser kinds, with some goodly pike among them.\r\nAs a boy the writer has caught many a pike by the process called\r\n“sniggling,” _i.e._, a noose of wire, or gimp, attached to the end of a\r\nstiff rod, or stick, which is deftly slipt over a fish’s head, as he\r\nbasks among the water weeds, and, when thus snared, he is jerked ashore.\r\nWhen shooting in the Fens he has also killed, at one shot, five or six\r\nfish crowded together in a dyke.  But climatic alterations, and\r\nover-perfect drainage, have changed all this.  The water now runs out to\r\nsea so rapidly that the Fen drains are dry for a great part of the year,\r\nand the fish are no more.\r\n\r\nEnough has now been said to show that the visitor to Woodhall Spa, who\r\nhas a taste for “the contemplative man’s recreation,” {81} may find some\r\nemployment in its vicinity.  Most of the ponds can be fished on asking\r\nthe farmers’ permission.  As to the Witham, although there are angling\r\nclubs at Boston and Lincoln, the river is practically open to every one,\r\nin the season.  It may be added that close to Tattershall station there\r\nis a large “ballast pond” containing good pike, and a letter to the\r\nshooting tenant, or to Lord Fortescue’s agent, would probably obtain\r\npermission to fish.  At Revesby there is a reservoir, the source of the\r\nwater supply of Boston, a large piece of water, which abounds in fish of\r\nvarious kinds.  Bream, both of the silver and the carp kinds, are\r\nplentiful, running up to 4lb. in weight.  Very large eels are taken\r\nthere.  Roach are of a fair size.  Rudd are numerous; as also are perch,\r\nbut small.  Gudgeons are plentiful, serving for bait.  Pike are abundant.\r\nIn one case three were taken by the same rod within twenty minutes, one\r\nof them weighing 13lb.  Another rod took two of 16lb. and 10lb., and it\r\nis commonly said that there is one occasionally seen “as long as a rail.”\r\nPermission may be obtained to fish here from the agent of the Hon. Mrs.\r\nStanhope, Revesby Abbey.  There is good accommodation at the Red Lion\r\nHotel.\r\n\r\nAs, in the next chapter, I am to enter upon a different branch of my\r\nsubject, passing roughly speaking, from the organic to inorganic—from the\r\nliving to the dead—I will here give a few particulars, recently received,\r\nwhich may interest the entomologist.  In the month of August, 1898, I\r\nconducted the members of our county Naturalists’ Union from Woodhall Spa\r\nto Tumby, through a varied tract of country.  The following is a list of\r\nthe Lepidoptera which were found by one of the members:—\r\n\r\nPieris brassicæ          E. hyperanthus\r\n\r\nP. rapæ                  Thecla quercus\r\n\r\nP. napi                  Polyommatus phlœas\r\n\r\nColias edusa             Lycœna icarus\r\n\r\nArgynnis aglaia          Hesperia thaumas\r\n\r\nA. paphia                Spilosoma mendica (two larvæ)\r\n\r\nVanessa io\r\n\r\nV. atalanta              Psilura monacha\r\n\r\nApatura iris             Plusia gamma\r\n\r\nPararge megæra           Geometra papilionaria\r\n\r\nEpinephele janira        Cidaria immanata\r\n\r\nE. tithonus              Eubolia limitata\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo other members collected the following:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEUOPTERA\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Sympetrum sp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYMENOPTERA\r\n\r\nVespa germanica          Crabro cribrarius\r\n\r\nV. vulgaris              C. albilabris\r\n\r\nBombus lapidarius        Halictus leucopus\r\n\r\nBombus hortorum          Apis mellifica\r\n\r\nFormica rufa\r\n\r\nDIPTERA\r\n\r\nPlatychirus clypeatus         Calliphora vomitoria\r\n\r\nScatophaga stercoraria\r\n\r\nCOLEOPTERA\r\n\r\nGeotrupes spiniger             Otiorrhyncus picipes\r\n\r\nG. stercorarius                Psylliodes cupro-nitens\r\n\r\nCoccinella 7-punctata          Ragonycha fulva\r\n\r\nC. variabilis                  Meligethes æneus\r\n\r\nStrangalia armata              Necrophorus humator\r\n\r\nPolydrusus pterygomalis        N. ruspator\r\n\r\n                               N. mortuorum\r\n\r\nStrophosomus coryli            Aphodius rufipes\r\n\r\nHEMIPTERA-HETEROPTERA\r\n\r\n\r\n(in Fulsby Wood).\r\n\r\nMiris lævigatus                 Leptopterna ferrugata\r\n\r\nCalocoris roseomaculatus        Œtorhinus angulatus\r\n\r\n                                Orthotylus scotti\r\n\r\nC. bipunctatus                  Nabis lativentris\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(In Tumby Wood.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThose marked * are new to Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\n*Piezodorus lituratus (abundant     *Onychumenus decolor\r\non gorse)\r\n\r\nStygnus rusticus (at roots of       *Psallus alnicola (on birch)\r\nheather)\r\n\r\n*Dictyonota strichnocera (on        Asciodema obsoletum\r\ngorse)\r\n\r\nMiris calcaratus                    Lygus viridis (on birch)\r\n\r\nOrthotylus ericetorum (abundant\r\non heather)\r\n\r\nSPIDERS.\r\n\r\nAnyphæna accentuata                 Meta segmentata\r\n\r\nEpeira gibbosa (a first record)     Epeira marmorea (doubtful, not yet\r\n                                    recorded in Britain)\r\n\r\nDictyna arundinacea                 Xysticus pini\r\n\r\nDiœa dorsata (a first record)       Epeira sollers\r\n\r\nEpeira quadrata                     Linyphia triangularis\r\n\r\nE. scalaris                         Theridion varians\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.  GEOLOGICAL NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a county like Lincolnshire, mainly agricultural, in which the\r\noperations of man are, for the most part, confined to the earth’s crust,\r\nin ploughing and sowing, and, as some one has said, in “tickling” the\r\nearth’s surface into fertility,—in such a county we are not led\r\nordinarily to explore the inner bowels of the world; as is necessary in\r\nmining districts such as certain parts of Yorkshire, Durham, Cornwall and\r\nelsewhere.  Yet, with regard to our knowledge of its geological features,\r\nWoodhall may be said to compare favourably with a large majority of\r\nplaces.  With one exception {84a} it is the spot, _par excellence_, in\r\nthis part of the kingdom, where the earth’s hidden resources have been\r\ntapped, and tapped to considerable purpose, in the unique commodity for\r\nwhich it is famed—its mineral water.  The book of Nature, so often\r\n“sealed,” has here been opened and its contents indexed.  We have in the\r\nstrata of the Woodhall well sundry chapters in the earth’s past history\r\nunfolded, at least to the initiated.  The writer is not going to attempt\r\nhere a systematic disquisition on a subject so abstruse (for which,\r\nindeed, he is not qualified), beyond touching upon some of its more\r\nsalient, or more interesting features.  The geological records of the\r\nWoodhall well have already been given {84b} in the very concise form in\r\nwhich they have been preserved for us.  Whether they are to be entirely\r\ndepended upon is questionable, but we may here repeat them:—Gravel and\r\nboulder clay, 10 feet; Kimeridge and Oxford clays, 350; Kellaways rock,\r\nblue clays, cornbrash, limestone, great oolite, clay and limestone, upper\r\nEstuarine clay, 140; Lincolnshire oolite, and Northampton sand, 140;\r\nlias, upper, middle, and lower, 380 feet; total, 1,120 feet.  The mineral\r\nspring is said to have issued from a stratum of spongy rock lying at a\r\ndepth of 540ft. {85a}  This would probably be in or near the ferruginous\r\nNorthampton sand, the lowest layer of the oolite, and lying immediately\r\nabove the upper lias. {85b}\r\n\r\nIn the year 1897 a boring was commenced within 500 yards of the original\r\nwell by the artesian engineers, Messrs. Isler and Co., on behalf of the\r\nRev. J. O. Stephens, on the west side of the Stixwould road, with a view\r\nto obtaining a second supply of the Woodhall water; this was carried to a\r\ndepth of 700 feet.  The engineers furnished me with a register of the\r\nstrata so far pierced by the bore, but, as they are not described in the\r\ntechnical terms of geology, it is rather difficult to compare them with\r\nthose of the old well.  At a depth of 490 feet, sandstone with iron\r\npyrites was pierced; this would probably be the ferruginous Northampton\r\nsand of the Oolite.  It is at a less depth than the same stratum at the\r\nSpa well; but that was to be expected, as geologists state that all the\r\ngeological strata “dip” eastward, and this bore being to the west, the\r\nstratum would naturally tilt upward.  This born was ultimately abandoned.\r\nAccording to the records of the Spa well, derived from Dr. Snaith, of\r\nHorncastle, who knew the well from its birth, the saline spring was found\r\nat 540ft.; but Dr. Granville, who visited Woodhall, and wrote his\r\nversion, in 1841, puts it at 510ft.  It is difficult to say which of\r\nthese two doctors, who differ, should be accepted as the more\r\ntrustworthy; and in 1841 Dr. Granville would still certainly be able to\r\nfind plenty of persons familiar with the well and its details.  But in\r\nthe ferruginous sand, or near it, the spring was to be expected; and\r\nthere it would seem Messrs. Isler, in the new boring, found saline water,\r\nthough only in small quantity.  The depth, according to their\r\ncomputation, was, as we have said 490ft., which is 20ft. above the Spa\r\nspring’s level, according to Granville’s version, and 60ft. above the\r\ndepth given by Snaith.  The paucity of the supply of the saline water in\r\nthe Isler boring may probably be accounted for thus: The trend of the\r\ncurrent found in making the Spa well was said to be from south-east to\r\nnorth-west, whereas this new bore is very nearly due west from the Spa\r\nwell.  If, therefore, the stream is of narrow width, this later boring is\r\nscarcely in the position to catch more than the side soakage of the\r\ncurrent, and it would seem that the main stream can only be tapped either\r\nby another boring further north, or by a lateral shaft from the present\r\nbore running northward till it encounters the current.  There remains, of\r\ncourse, the further and open question as to whether the saline stream\r\nformerly passing _through_ the Spa shaft, still continues its former\r\nnorth-westerly course, after having the outlet afforded by that shaft.\r\nWould it not be more in accordance with the law of nature that the stream\r\nshould take the course of least resistance by rising in the well, and not\r\nflowing further along the bed of its special original stratum?  If that\r\nbe so, the only chance of another well would be to bore south-eastward of\r\nthe Spa; and probably the shaft sunk by the late Mr. Blyton beside\r\nCoalpit Wood, if it had been continued, would have proved a safer venture\r\nthan any other as yet attempted.  At some future time we may have the\r\nwolf disturbing the stream, above the lamb represented by the original\r\nwell, to the detriment of the latter.  It may be here noticed that in the\r\nScarle boring, as we are told, there was found a strong spring in the\r\nupper part of the lower Keuper sandstone at the depth of 790ft., and a\r\nstill stronger spring at the base of that formation at 950ft.  In that\r\ncase, therefore, as also at Woodhall, the water was found in sandstone,\r\nbut at a much greater depth, and also in sandstone of a different\r\ncharacter, viz., the Keuper at Scarle, the Northampton at Woodhall.\r\nAnother difference is that in the Scarle strata we pass at once from the\r\nsurface drift to the lower Lias; the Kimeridge clay and all the Oolite\r\nformations, which are found at Woodhall, with a thickness of some 630ft.,\r\nbeing entirely absent.  These differences, of course, illustrate the fact\r\nthat, owing to abrasion and other causes, not only do the strata\r\nunderlying the surface drift vary in different localities, but their\r\nseveral thicknesses vary; while, as at Harrogate, the mineral properties\r\nof the water also vary at a distance of only a few yards.  Pass beyond\r\nthe limits of the particular stream, and, below ground as well as above\r\nit, you are not “in the swim.”\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1904, Mr. R. A. Came, of the Royal Hotel, commenced\r\nsinking a shaft, in search of the Spa water, at a point some ¾ mile south\r\nof the original well; and early in 1905 water was struck at a depth of\r\n492 feet, which proved to have the same saline properties, with the\r\naddition of Epsom salt, a good supply issuing from the spongy sandstone.\r\nThis opens up a vista of great possibilities in the future; it does away\r\nwith the monopoly hitherto existing, and may have a most important\r\neffect, in the further development of the Spa.  The well is 7ft. in\r\ndiameter, is bricked to a depth of 495ft., and sunk to 520ft.  The boring\r\nwas carried out by Mr. Joseph Aldridge, of Measham, near Atherstone,\r\nWarwickshire, an expert mining engineer.  Many fine fossils, as\r\nammonites, belemnites, and bi-valves, were found in the different strata\r\nthat were pierced.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to remark upon some of the geological strata, as found at\r\nWoodhall.  And first, after the mere surface gravel, we have the Boulder\r\nclay.  This has a very interesting history.  In the “Life of Nansen,” the\r\nArctic traveller, it is stated {87a} that the geological strata of the\r\nArctic regions show that at some remote period the climatic conditions\r\nwere the reverse of those which prevail now.  Throughout those regions,\r\nat present of intense cold, there was quite a southern climate, in which\r\nwalnut trees, magnolias, vines, etc., flourished; while, on the other\r\nhand, there was also a period during which our own country, and large\r\nparts of the Continent, lying in the same latitude, were buried under\r\nvast ice-fields with an Esquimaux climate.  It is there further stated\r\n{87b} that boulders are found scattered over Norway, Sweden, and Denmark,\r\nwhich have been transported thither on glaciers, from regions still\r\nfurther north.  In like manner glaciers at one time also spread over what\r\nare now Scotland and a great part of England, bringing along with them\r\nboulders from Norway, and Scandinavia generally.  The present condition\r\nof Greenland, with its vast glaciers, pouring through its valleys, down\r\nto the water’s edge, on the sea shore, illustrates the condition of our\r\nown country at that remote period. {88a}  As regards this country, these\r\nice-streams may be classed under two distinct heads, (_a_) the native,\r\ninland glaciers, and (_b_) the north-eastern, Scandinavian glacier.  To\r\nspeak first of the former.  As the climate, from causes into which we\r\ncannot here enter, {88b} gradually became coldier, glaciers were formed\r\namong the rugged hills in the present lake country of Cumberland and\r\nWestmoreland, some of which pushed their way westward, literally inch by\r\ninch, until they debouched in the Irish Sea, and filled it to\r\noverflowing, for it is only shallow.  From Borrowdale, Buttermere,\r\nEskdale, and other head centres, they also streamed southward and\r\neastward.  There was an immense central stream, which forced its way over\r\nthe wild tract of Stainmoor (named doubtless from the thousands of\r\nboulders with which it is strewn); then, fed by lateral branches from\r\nmany directions, it traversed Teesdale, turned towards the coast, passing\r\nby Scarborough, and so on to Holderness and the Humber, a branch also\r\nfilling up Airedale and the Vale of York. {88c}  From Holderness it\r\npassed the Humber, into Lincolnshire.  Its most eastern limb would\r\ndoubtless have debouched in the North Sea, and filled it; but here the\r\nnorth-eastern glacier, to which I have alluded, came into collision.\r\nTaking its rise in Scandinavia, it had spread into a vast sheet in parts\r\n3,000ft. thick, {89a} filled up the shallow North Sea, and the Baltic, a\r\nveritable _mer de glace_, and over-run northern Germany, its thickness\r\neven at Berlin being supposed to have been 1,300ft.  Impinging on our\r\neastern coast of Scotland and of northern England, it spread over a great\r\npart of Holderness, meeting and blending with the inland native glacier\r\non the Humber; and the vast united ice-stream thence pursued its onward\r\nsouthern course, enfolding everything in its icy embrace, to the Thames\r\nand to the Severn. {89b}  These great ice-streams created the geological\r\nformation called “The Drift,” or boulder-clay, which we have at Woodhall.\r\nThe clay is simply the _detritus_, produced by the grinding, through long\r\nages, of the rocks under the vast and weighty ice-fields slowly moving\r\nover them, and the abrasion of the hill-sides which they scraped in their\r\ncourse.  The boulders are detached fragments, which fell from various\r\nrocky heights overhanging the ice-stream, rested on the surface of the\r\nice-sheet, were borne along by it through hundreds of miles, and when, in\r\nthe course of ages untold, the climate became milder, and the glaciers\r\ngradually shrunk and eventually disappeared, these fragments, often\r\nbearing the marks of ice-scraping, and oftener rounded by ice-action,\r\nfell to the soil beneath, and remain to this day, to bear their silent\r\nwitness to the course once taken by the giant ice-stream.  The period\r\nthrough which this process was going on has been variously computed, from\r\n18,000 years, according to the estimate of Major-General A. W. Drayson,\r\nF.R.A.S., who gives elaborate astronomical statistics in support of his\r\nviews (Trans. Victoria Institute, No. 104, p. 260), to 160,000, as\r\ncalculated by Mr. James Croll (“Climate and Time”).  It is now generally\r\nheld that there were more than one ice-age, with inter-glacial breaks.\r\nThese boulders are abundant in our neighbourhood, and of all sizes.  They\r\nmay be measured by inches or by yards.  There is a good-sized one in the\r\nvicarage garden at Woodhall Spa, which the present writer had carted from\r\nKirkby-lane, a distance of a mile and a half.  There is a larger one\r\nlying on the moor, near the south-east corner of the Ostler Ground.  The\r\nwriter has one in his own garden, a large one, more than 6ft. in length\r\nby 3½ft. high, and 2½ft. thick.  It took five horses to drag it from its\r\nposition, a quarter of a mile distant.  There are six visible in the\r\nparish of Langton, two or three large ones near Old Woodhall Church;\r\nseveral large ones in Thimbleby, Edlington, and elsewhere.  Smaller ones\r\nare often to be seen placed at turns in the roads to prevent drivers\r\nrunning their vehicles into the bank, or used as foundations to old\r\ncottages or farm buildings; and still smaller specimens may be constantly\r\npicked up by the pedestrian, or the sportsman, in his rambles through the\r\nfields.  Much interest has of late years been taken in these boulders,\r\narising from the distinct classes of glaciers to which I have referred,\r\nand the consequent difference between the nature of the boulders, as well\r\nas the source from which they have come, according as they belong to the\r\none class or the other; and our Lincolnshire Naturalists’ Union have now\r\na special “boulder committee” engaged in the investigation of this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe late Professor Sedgewick, of Cambridge (whose lectures the writer\r\nattended), was the first to notice that along the Holderness shore there\r\nwere (as he says) “an incredible number of blocks of granite, gneiss,\r\ngreenstone, mica, etc., etc., resembling specimens derived from various\r\nparts of Scandinavia.” {90}  These, we now know, were dropped by the\r\ngreat Scandinavian glacier; and, along with the kinds of stone here\r\nnamed, there are also boulders of Rhombporphyry (the “Rhomben porphyry”\r\nof Norwegian geologists, from the neighbourhood of Christiana), Augite\r\nsyenite, and several more, not of British origin.  These boulders are now\r\nbeing searched for, and found in our own neighbourhood.  On the other\r\nhand, there is the different class of boulders which were brought down by\r\nthe native inland glaciers.  These consist largely of igneous kinds.  The\r\nrugged hills of the Lake district owe their origin to fire; and the\r\nboulders which the glaciers have transported correspond.  The shap\r\ngranite, for instance, which is probably one of the commonest of this\r\nclass, comes from the shap granite bed of Wastdale, in Cumberland.\r\nBoulders of this rock, as Mr. Kendall tells us, “passed over Stainmoor in\r\ntens of thousands,” {91a} to visit us in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.\r\nOther kinds are Felspar porphyry from Eskdale, in Cumberland, Andesite\r\nfrom Borrowdale, Granophyr from Ennerdale and Buttermere, Quartz, Basalt,\r\nand several more from the crystalline formations in the Lake district.\r\nSeveral boulders of these rocks have also been found in our own\r\nneighbourhood; and doubtless more remain to reward the explorer. {91b}  I\r\nhave dwelt at some length on this particular formation—the boulder\r\nclay—because it is the most ready to hand; it lies on the surface, in\r\nmany parts around us, within the ken of the ordinary visitor to Woodhall\r\nSpa.  It may give an additional interest to his rambles in search of\r\nhealth, to know that he may, at any moment, pick up a boulder which has\r\ntravelled further, and passed through more strange vicissitudes, than he\r\ncan well have done himself; perhaps, with Shakespeare, to read “Sermons\r\nin Stones,” and to moralise on the brevity of human life, with all its\r\nailments, compared with those ages untold, through which the pebble in\r\nhis hand slowly {91c} travelled on its long, laborious journey, to rest\r\nat length as a constituent element of the locality, where he himself is\r\nseeking relief and recreation.\r\n\r\nTo the west of Woodhall Spa, beyond the Stixwould-road, near the\r\nvicarage, and northward, the surface sand, in some parts, at the depth of\r\na foot, or slightly more, hardens into an ironstone, so compact that tree\r\nroots cannot penetrate it.  In root-pruning or manuring apple-trees, I\r\nhave found the tap-root stunted into a large round knob, further downward\r\ngrowth being prevented by this indurated formation.  This oxide of iron\r\nalso pervades the sandy soil, in parts, to a depth of four or five feet,\r\nimpregnating the water with ferruginous properties, so that it “ferrs”\r\nbottles, or vessels, in which it is allowed to stand for any length of\r\ntime.  In consequence, the water frequently has a dull appearance,\r\nalthough the iron may probably make it a wholesome tonic.\r\n\r\nThe surface sand, which is of a still lighter character on the moor\r\nground in Woodhall, and in Martin, Roughton, and Kirkby, contiguous to\r\nWoodhall, is what is technically called the “Old Blown Sand,” borne by\r\nthe winds from the whilom salt marshflats of the Witham, when it was much\r\nwider than at present, and a tidal arm of the sea.  It is comparatively a\r\nrecent formation, yet abounding in fine particles, or pebbles, of quartz,\r\nand other elements of far earlier date; the larger of these are often\r\nrounded by tidal action.  Below this surface sand we find, in many parts,\r\na blue clay of varying depth.  In a pit called Jordan’s pond, in an\r\nabandoned brickyard on the east of the road to Stixwould, it is at least\r\n16ft. thick; also, in a large pit in Kirkstead, near Hogwood, some\r\nhalf-mile south-east of the Abbey Inn, which was dug to procure this\r\nclay, for “claying” the light super-soil, otherwise almost barren, it is\r\nmany feet thick.  Ammonites and other fossils are plentiful in it, often\r\ncemented together with veins of gypsum.  Both these pits are mentioned in\r\nthe Government Geological Survey (pp. 152, 153) of “The country around\r\nLincoln.”  Close by the latter pit the writer once found a curious\r\nfossil, which was for some time a puzzle to all who saw it.  It is now in\r\nthe British Museum, and was pronounced to be an Echinus crashed into an\r\nAmmonite.\r\n\r\nThe Kimeridge clay, named as the next stratum in the bore of the Woodhall\r\nwell, crops up first about Halstead Hall in Stixwould, and continues\r\nthrough Woodhall to Horncastle, and so on to Wragby and Market Rasen.  It\r\nabounds in fossils.  Mr. Skertchly {92} found in the first of the pits\r\njust named, that this clay was divided into three layers, the upper being\r\na line of Septaria (or nodules) full of serpulæ one foot in depth, then\r\nsoft dark-blue clay, 6ft.; and below that another course of Septaria; and\r\nProfessor J. R. Blake records from this pit the following\r\nfossils{93a}:—Belemnites nitidus, Ammonites serratus, Rissoa mosensis,\r\nAvicula ædiligensis, Cyprina cyreneformis, Ostrea deltoides, Lima\r\nædilignensis, Thracia depressa, Arca, Serpula tetragona.  In other pits\r\nin the neighbourhood several other fossils have been found. {93b}  [For a\r\nlist of fossils found about Woodhall see Appendix II.]  A peculiarity of\r\nthis stratum is that the upper part of it contains bands of “inflammable\r\nshales,” being blue, laminated, bituminous clays, which burn readily.  It\r\nwas the presence of these which has tempted explorers to throw away their\r\nmoney in search of coal; as in the case at Donington on-Bain, where Mr.\r\nBogg drove a bore to the depth of 309ft., but only found clay and thin\r\nbands of inflammable schist. {93c}  In the case of Woodhall Spa, the\r\nmoney thrown away on one purpose has brought health and wealth to others,\r\nfrom a source then undreamt of in man’s philosophy.  We cannot leave the\r\nKimeridge clay without noting that its presence at Woodhall, in the\r\nposition where it is, as the _first_ geological formation below the\r\nsurface drift, opens to us a vista—reveals to us a yawning _hiatus_—which\r\nembraces a vast expanse of time.\r\n\r\nIn the normal order of geological strata, the whole series of cretaceous\r\nformations have to be passed through before reaching the Oolite\r\nformation, of which the Kimeridge clay forms almost the upper layer.  But\r\nat Woodhall and the surrounding district the whole of this series of\r\nrocks and soils is wanting.  Their absence is eloquent, and tells a tale\r\nof widespread destruction.  Standing near the Tower on the Moor we can\r\nsee in the distance, stretching from north-west to south east, the range\r\nof hills called the “Wolds,” which, with a “cap” of marls, or sandy and\r\nflinty loams, are composed almost entirely of chalk; from them, near\r\nCawkwell Hill (the hill _par excellence_ of chalk), comes the water\r\nsupply of Horncastle and Woodhall.  They extend for a length of some 45\r\nmiles, with a width of some six miles to eight.  The actual depth of the\r\nchalk is not exactly known, but a boring made through it, near Hull,\r\nreached the Oolite beneath at 530ft.  We may perhaps, therefore, put the\r\naverage at 500ft. {94a}  Doubtless, at one period, this cretaceous\r\nformation extended over the whole tract of country, but southward and\r\nwestward from the foot of the present wolds it has since been swept away.\r\nAnd this must have taken place before the glacial period, because the\r\nglacial boulder clay lies upon the Kimeridge clay, which normally\r\nunderlies the chalk.  Mr. Jukes Brown (“Geological Journal,” No. 162, p.\r\n117) says: “The Boulder clay is bedded against the slope of the chalk,\r\nshewing that this escarpment had retired to its present position in\r\npre-glacial times.”  By what precise process this was effected must be\r\nleft to our savants to decide; but the remarkable fact remains, that a\r\nsolid stratum, or rather series of allied strata, from 500ft. to 1,000ft.\r\nin thickness, has, by one process or another, been wiped out of\r\nexistence, over the large area now coated by the Kimeridge clay.  Through\r\nages of enormous length the chalk was forming as the bed of a sea; a\r\ndeposit consisting of inconceivable myriads of beautiful minute shells,\r\nmainly of the foraminifera, which can be detected by the microscope; and\r\nits destruction probably occupied as long a period as its formation.\r\n\r\nMr. Jukes Brown, whom I have just quoted, says: “The Wold hills must have\r\nbeen, in some way, exposed to a severe and long-continued detrition, when\r\nerosive agencies were very active.”  Active, indeed, they must have been,\r\nto efface from an area so extensive a solid formation from 500ft. to\r\n1,000ft. in thickness.  And this boulder clay, as Mr. Jukes Brown further\r\nobserves, has forced its way up the sides of the chalk, in places, to a\r\nheight varying from 300ft. to 400ft.\r\n\r\nThe Oxford clay, which lies next below the Kimeridge, is a deep sea\r\ndeposit, dark blue, with brown nodular stones; some of the fossils found\r\nin it are Nucula Ornata, Ammonites Plicatilis, A. Rotundus, Cucullæa,\r\nGryphæa Dilatata, Leda Phillipsii, Annelida Tetragona, and A.\r\nTricarinata, Avicula inequivalvis. {94b}\r\n\r\nKellaway’s rock, which lies just below, so called from a village in\r\nWiltshire, near Chippenham, is a mixture of yellowish and buff sands,\r\nwith brown and buff sandstone.  The chief fossils are Gryphæa Dilatata,\r\nand G. bilobata, Belemnites in abundance, and Avicula Braam-buriensis.\r\n{95a}\r\n\r\nThe Cornbrash, which succeeds (so called also from a district in\r\nWiltshire, favourable to corn), is a light grey, fine-grained limestone,\r\noften so hard as to need blasting.  It abounds in fossils.  Among them\r\nare Avicula Echinata, Ostræa Sowerbyi, Clypeus Ptotii, Ammonites\r\nMacrocephalus, A. Herveyi, Nucula Variabilis, Astarte Minima, Trigonia\r\n(of four kinds), Modiola (of four kinds), Myacites (five kinds),\r\nCypricardia, Corbicella Bathonica, Pholadomya (two kinds), Cardium (three\r\nkinds), Pecten (six kinds), and several more. {95b}\r\n\r\nThe great Oolite (so named from the Greek Oon, an egg, referring to the\r\nnumber of small stones, like fish-ova, found in it) is divided into\r\nOolite clays and O. limestone.  The clays are mottled green and bluish,\r\nwith bands of ironstone, and concretions of lime.  They indicate a\r\nshallow sea, as contrasted with the Oxford clay.  Fossils are not\r\nnumerous, but Rhinconella Concinna, Gervillia Crassicosta, Modiola\r\nUngulata, Ostræa Gregaria, O. Sowerbvi, O. Subrugulosa, Perna Quardrata,\r\nTrigonia Flecta, and Palate of Fish are found. {95c}  These beds\r\ncorrespond to the so-called Forest Marble of the South of England.\r\n\r\nThe Oolite limestone beds consist of white soft limestones, having at\r\nintervals bands of marly clay.  This formation burns well, and makes good\r\nlime.  Its chief fossils are Serpula, Rhynconella, Terebratula, and T.\r\nIntermedia, Avicula Echinata, Corbicella, Lima Rigida, Lucina, Modiola\r\nImbricata, Myacites Calceiformis, Mytilus Furcatus, Ostræa Sowerbyi,\r\nPecten Vagans, Pteroperna plana, Trigonia, T. costata, T. flecta, T.\r\nstriata, T. undulata. {95d}\r\n\r\nThe Estuarine deposit, underlying the great Oolite limestone, is composed\r\nof light blue, green, and purple clays, intersected by soft bands of\r\nsandstone, and having at its base a band of nodular ironstone.  It is not\r\nvery fossiliferous, but the following are found:—Rhynconella Concinna,\r\nModiola Imbricata, Ostræa Sowerbyi, Monodonta. {95e}  The sandstone bands\r\ncontain plant-markings in considerable numbers.  As its name implies,\r\nthis formation was produced as the bed of an estuary or tidal river.\r\n\r\nThe next lower formation is the Lincolnshire limestone.  This enters\r\nlargely into the making of what is called “the Cliff,” which is the high\r\nland running south from Lincoln (visible from Woodhall) to the west of\r\nthe Witham Valley and the Fens.  It is a hard building stone, though once\r\nthe muddy bed of a sea.  It is sub-divided into the Hibaldstow and Kirton\r\nbeds, so called because these strata are exposed in those parishes.\r\nDipping to the east, it underlies the Fens and other upper strata to be\r\nfound in the Woodhall well.  It abounds in fossils, there being as many\r\nas 340 species classified, {96a} and consists, indeed, very largely of\r\nthe hard parts of shells and corals compressed into a solid mass.  To a\r\nLincolnshire person, it is sufficient to say of this stone that our grand\r\nCathedral is mainly built of it.  We can only give here a few of the more\r\nfrequent species of fossils:—Three kinds of Echinus, Coral (Thecosmilia\r\ngregarea), Serpula socialis, Lima (five kinds), Ostræa flabelloides,\r\nPecten (two kinds), Hinnites abjectus, Astarte elegans, Cardium Buckmani,\r\nCeromya Bajociana, Cyprina Loweana, Homomya Crassiuscula, Isocardia,\r\nCordata, Rhynconella (four kinds); among the bivalves are Avicula\r\nInequivalvis, and A Munsteri, Lima (three kinds), Lucina Bellona, Modiola\r\nGibbosa, Mytilus Imbricatus, Pholadomya (two kinds), Trigonia costata; of\r\nunivalves, Natica (two kinds), Nerinea Cingenda; of fishes, Strophodus\r\n(two kinds). {96b}  This is a most useful stone for building purposes.\r\nThe so-called “Lincoln stone” is largely used in our churches; whilst the\r\n“Ancaster quarries,” which also belong to this formation, are famous.\r\nThe commissioners appointed in 1839 to report on the building stones of\r\nEngland, for the new houses of Parliament, stated that “many buildings\r\nconstructed of material similar to the Oolite of Ancaster, such as Newark\r\nand Grantham churches, have scarcely yielded to the effects of\r\natmospheric influences.”  (“Old Lincolnshire,” vol. i., p. 23.)  The\r\nwell-known Colly-Weston slates are the lowest stratum of this rock.  The\r\nfine old Roman “Newport Arch,” which for some 700 years has “braved the\r\nbattle and the breeze,” a pretty good test of its durability, is built of\r\nthis stone.\r\n\r\nThe base on which this lowest Oolite lies is the Northampton Sands, an\r\nirony stratum of red ferruginous sand and sandstone, the upper portion of\r\nit also being called the Lower Estuarine deposit.  It is from this\r\nstratum so many springs arise in various parts of the county, as already\r\nmentioned, and among them the Woodhall well water.  Its fresh water\r\nconditions show it to have been the bed of a great river, but a tidal\r\nriver, as among the fossils which it contains some are marine shells.  In\r\nthis formation is found the iron-stone, which is worked at Lincoln.  Its\r\ncommoner fossils are Lima duplicata, L. Dustonensis, Hinnites abjectus,\r\nAstarte elegans, Cardium Buckmani, Modiola Gibbosa, Ammonites\r\nMurchisoniæ, Belemnites Acutus.  Its ferruginous layers are (as given by\r\nCapt. Macdakin), {97a}  Peroxide bed, clay ironstone, hard carbonate of\r\niron, hard blue carbonate peroxidised band, blue ferruginous sand,\r\nironstone nodules, bed of coprolites with iron pyrites.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings us to the Lias formation, in which lies the lower part,\r\namounting to rather more than a third, of the Woodhall wells.  It is\r\ndivided into the upper Lias of clay and shale; the middle Lias of\r\nMarlstone rock bed, clay, and ironstone; and the lower Lias of clays,\r\nironstone clays, limestones. {97b}  This formation, with a thickness of\r\nfrom 900 to 1,000 feet, runs across England from Yorkshire and\r\nLincolnshire down to the coast of Dorset.  The upper Lias of the Woodhall\r\nwells also helps to form the slope from 100 feet to 150 feet in thickness\r\nof the escarpment called “the Cliff,” to the west of the Witham Fens, and\r\nto the north of Lincoln, by Fillingham, and so on.  Lincoln itself stands\r\non Lias beds, with a capping of the lower Oolite limestone. {97c}  It\r\ncontains many Belemnites, Lucina, Ammonites Bifrons, A. Serpentinus, A.\r\nCommunis, A. Heterophillus, Nucula Hammeri, Pleuromyæ, {97d} and\r\nespecially the Leda Ovum, which distinguishes it from other strata.  The\r\nmiddle Lias, which underlies the upper, contains Ammonites Spinatus, A.\r\nMargaritatus (in great abundance), Rhinconella, Icthyosauri, Plesiosauri,\r\nand fossil wood, etc. {98a}  The lower Lias contains Ammonites\r\nCapricornus, with many pyrites, A. Ibex, A. Jamesoni, A. Armatus, A.\r\nOxynotus, A. Obtusus, A. Semicostatus, A. Bucklandi, A. Angulatus, A.\r\nPlanorbis, Gryphœa incurva very abundant, and fossils of many other\r\nkinds. {98b}  This brings us to the base of the Woodhall Spa wells.  For\r\na full list of the fossils so far found at Woodhall, the reader is\r\nreferred to Appendix II. at the and of this volume.\r\n\r\nThese strata are shewn in the diagram given at the head of this chapter.\r\n\r\nIn giving the history of the well in Chapter I., the writer did not state\r\nthe properties of the Woodhall water; but as these depend upon the\r\ngeological elements, from which it originates, this seems to be the\r\nproper place to state them.  The official analysis made by Professor\r\nFrankland, F.R.S., 1875, is as follows:—{98c}\r\n\r\n                                         Parts           Grains per gallon\r\n\r\nTotal solids in solution              2361.200                   1652.8400\r\n\r\nOrganic carbon                            .362                       .2604\r\n\r\nOrganic Nitrogen                          .532                       .3724\r\n\r\nAmmonia                                   .810                       .5070\r\n\r\nNitrogen as Nitrates and                  .009                       .0063\r\nNitrites\r\n\r\nChlorine                              1425.000                    997.5000\r\n\r\nTotal combined nitrogen                  1.208                       .8456\r\n\r\nBromine                                  6.280                      4.3960\r\n\r\nIodine                                    .880                       .6160\r\n\r\nArsenicam                                 .016                       .0112\r\n\r\nTemporary hardness                      20.000                     14.0000\r\n\r\nPermanent do                           245.000                    171.5000\r\n\r\nTotal do.                              265.000                    185.5000\r\n\r\n    The water contains unusually large proportions of Iodine and\r\n    Bromine.—E. Frankland.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable features of this analysis are the quantities of iodine and\r\nbromine.  Professor Frankland, for the Geological Survey, found, of\r\niodine, 6.1 grains in 10 gallons of the water; bromine, 44 grains in\r\nditto.\r\n\r\nAs compared with the water of Cheltenham, of Leamington, and of the famed\r\nGerman Spa at Kreuznach, we have the original analysis of Mr. West, of\r\nLeeds, giving:—\r\n\r\n   In 10 galls.              Iodine.                     Bromine.\r\n\r\nCheltenham          one third grain             one and two-thirds grains\r\n\r\nLeamington          one grain                   four grains\r\n\r\nKreuznach           one and one-quarter grain   twenty-five grains\r\n\r\nWoodhall            six and one-sixth grains    forty-four grains\r\n\r\nThe Woodhall water, therefore, has five times the amount of iodine, and\r\nnearly twice the amount of bromine, of the strongest known Continental\r\nwater. {99a}\r\n\r\nI mentioned, in Chapter I., that the Dead Sea, in Palestine, was stronger\r\nin bromine than Woodhall.  According to M. Marchand’s analysis, it\r\ncontains bromide of magnesium 74 times the amount at Kreuznach, or about\r\n30 times the strength of Woodhall; but the other great ingredient of the\r\nWoodhall water, iodine, is absent from the Dead Sea. {99b}  In iodine the\r\nonly known water surpassing Woodhall Spa is the spring of Challes in\r\nSavoy, {99c} which contains 1.045 parts per 100,000 of water.\r\n\r\nI may add that at Old Woodhall, about four miles distant from “The Spa,”\r\nat a depth of 33 feet, in sinking a well, some 20 years ago, salt water\r\nwas tapped, resembling in taste that of the Woodhall Spa well, but it\r\ngradually became less salt, and finally was replaced by a supply of fresh\r\nwater. {99d}\r\n\r\nThere is one other geological feature of the neighbourhood of Woodhall,\r\nwhich has not yet been touched upon, viz., the Fens bordering on the\r\nWitham.  These are said to have been, to some extent, drained by the\r\nRomans; {99e} but within the last few centuries they have been partially\r\nreclaimed, have relapsed into bog and morass, and been finally reclaimed\r\nfor good, in quite recent times.  The writer, when a boy, used to visit a\r\nlarge farmer, living in Blankney Fen, whose father built the house in\r\nwhich he resided.  Before building, an artificial foundation had to be\r\nmade, by transporting soil in boats, or carts, from _terra firma_ beyond\r\nthe Fens, the whole Fen tract being more or less bog and swamp.  When\r\nthis had become sufficiently consolidated, the house and farm buildings\r\nwere erected upon it; and from that centre roads were constructed, drains\r\nmade, and the work of reclamation gradually extended.  These drains, or\r\n“skirths,” as they are sometimes called, were periodically cleaned by a\r\n“bab,” a kind of dredge, with hooks at its under side to tear up plant\r\nroots.  Great flocks of geese were kept, which were plucked alive several\r\ntimes a year, for the sale of the feathers, to make the famed\r\nLincolnshire feather beds, and quills for the pens, now rarely seen,\r\nalthough, 50 years ago, in universal use.  Until the land had become\r\nsystematically reclaimed, it still continued to be extensively flooded in\r\nthe winter months, and all cattle had to be housed, or penned, during\r\nthat time, on the artificially raised ground.  It frequently happened\r\nthat early frosts caught the farmer napping, with his cattle still\r\nafield; in which case they had to be driven home over the ice, and\r\nnumbers were at times “screeved,” _i.e._, “split up,” in the process, and\r\nhad to be slaughtered.  The fen soil is a mass of decayed vegetation,\r\nchiefly moss, interlarded with silt, deposited by the sea, which formerly\r\nmade its oozy way as far as Lincoln.  Large trees of bog oak and other\r\nkinds are found in the soil.  These, it is supposed, became rotted at\r\ntheir base by the accumulating peat; and the strong south-west winds,\r\nprevailing then as they do now, broke them off, and they are, in\r\nconsequence, generally found with their heads lying in a north-easterly\r\ndirection.  Borings at different places show the fen soil to vary in\r\ndepth from 24ft. at Boston to 14½ft. at Martindale; but, as it has been\r\ngradually dried by drainage, it has considerably shrunk in thickness, and\r\nburied trees, which only a few years ago were beyond the reach of plough\r\nor spade, are now not uncommonly caught by the ploughshare.\r\n\r\nThe river Witham, which the visitor to Woodhall Spa sees skirting the\r\nrailway, has passed through more than one metamorphosis.  Now confined by\r\nbanks, which have been alternately renewed and broken down at different\r\nperiods, before the drainage of the Fens, it spread over all that level\r\ntract of country, meandering by its many islands and through its oozy\r\nchannels and meres, the resort of countless flocks of wild fowl and fish\r\n_ad infinitum_, but preserving still one main navigable artery, by which\r\nvessels of considerable tonnage could slowly sail to Lincoln.  Acts were\r\npassed, in the reigns of Edward the Third.  Richard the Second, Henry the\r\nSeventh, Queen Elizabeth, and the two Charleses; and Commissioners were\r\nagain and again appointed to effect the embanking and draining of these\r\nwatery wastes, but with only temporary success; and it was not till 1787,\r\nor 1788, that the present complete system of drainage was commenced,\r\nwhich is now permanently established. {101a}  And in these days, the\r\nFens, once consisting as much of water as of land, at times even suffer\r\nfrom a scarcity of that commodity; drains, which within the writer’s own\r\nrecollection abounded with fish, being now often dry almost all the year\r\nround.  At a much more remote period the Witham was probably a much\r\nstronger river, and largely conduced to altering the features of the\r\ncounty.  This subject has been carefully investigated by our geologists,\r\n{101b} with the result that certain changes in the strata of the upper\r\nWitham valley, from its source near Grantham, and changes also in the\r\nlower valley of the Trent, go far to prove that the Trent, instead of, as\r\nit does now, flowing into the Humber, took a more easterly course, and\r\njoining forces with the Witham some miles above Lincoln, the united\r\nstreams pushed their way through the gorge, or “break” in the cliff\r\nformation, which occurs there, and is technically known as “The Lincoln\r\nGap,” and continued their course to the sea by something like the present\r\nchannel of the Witham.  The idea of this “Lincoln Gap,” though the term\r\nis not actually used, would seem to have originated with Mr. W. Bedford,\r\nwho stated, in a paper already mentioned, read before “The Lincolnshire\r\nTopographical Society,” in 1841, that “the great breach below Lincoln\r\ncould only be accounted for by the mighty force of agitated waters\r\ndashing against the rocks, through long ages”.  (Printed by W. and B.\r\nBrookes, Lincoln, 1843, p. 24, &c.)  The theory would seem to be now\r\ngenerally accepted.  Thus: “that ancient river, the river” Witham,\r\nhonoured, we believe, by the Druid as his sacred stream, {102}\r\nconsecrated in a later age to the Christian, by the number of religious\r\nhouses erected on its shores, through a yet earlier stage of its\r\nexistence performed the laborious task of carving out the vale of\r\nGrantham, and so adding to the varied beauty of our county; then, by a\r\nkind of metempsychosis of the river spirit, it was absorbed in the body\r\nof the larger Trent; the two, like “John Anderson, my Joe,” and his\r\ncontented spouse, “climbed the hill together,” to the Lincoln Gap, and\r\nhand in hand wended their seaward way, to help each other, perchance, in\r\ngiving birth to the Fenland; or, according to another theory, in making\r\nits bed.  Through a long era this union lasted; but, as the old saying\r\nis, “the course of true love never did run smooth”; a change geologic\r\ncame over the scene, and, through force of circumstance, the two, so long\r\nwedded together, broke the connubial bond, and henceforth separated,\r\npursuing each their different ways; the one, the Trent, the river of\r\nthirty fountains, betaking herself “to fresh woods and pastures new,”\r\nafter brief dalliance with the Ouse, became bosomed in the ample embrace\r\nof the Humber; the other, the humbler stream of the two, retaining its\r\nprevious course, pursued the even tenor of its way through the flats of\r\nthe Fenland, with their “crass air and rotten harrs,” to find its\r\nconsolation in the “dimpling smiles,” but restless bosom, of the shallow\r\n“Boston Deeps.”  During the period of that ancient alliance of these two\r\nstreams the tract of country between Lincoln and Boston, or rather\r\nbetween the points now occupied by those places, would be scoured by a\r\ngreatly-augmented volume of water, and this may possibly account in some\r\ndegree for the shallowness of “The Wash,” and the number of submarine\r\nsandbanks which lie off the mouth of the present Witham.  Had the union\r\nof the two streams continued to the present time, bringing down their\r\nunited body of silt, Boston would either never have come into existence\r\nat all, or would have been much further from the sea than it is.\r\n\r\nThe precise period at which this riverine union prevailed would seem to\r\nbe still an open question; and we may say, with Horace, _adhuc sub judice\r\nlis est_; for, whereas Professor Archibald Geikie, Director-General of\r\nthe Government Geological Survey, {103a} gives his opinion that “the\r\ngravels which have been laid down by an older Trent, that flowed through\r\nthe gorge in the Jurassie escarpment at Lincoln, were later than the\r\nglacial deposits”; on the other hand, Mr. F. M. Burton, F.L.S., F.G.S.,\r\n{103b} who has a thorough local knowledge of the county and its\r\ngeological features, says there is sufficient evidence “to convince any\r\nreasonable mind that the present course of the Trent is not its original\r\none; but that ages ago, in early pre-glacial times, I think, it passed\r\nthrough the Lincoln Gap to the fenland beyond, which was then open bay.”\r\nWe may well say with Pope: “Who shall decide when doctors disagree?”\r\n{103c}  This, however, is too large a subject for a chapter on the\r\ngeology of Woodhall Spa; but this brief reference to it may serve to show\r\nthe visitor, who has the taste and inclination for such pursuits, that\r\nthere are still subjects for interesting investigation in our\r\nneighbourhood, on which he might well employ his capacities for research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.  THE ARCHÆOLOGY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn entering on this portion of our Records we are passing from the\r\nNatural to the Artificial, from the operations of the Creator to the\r\nworks of the creature.  A systematic process of enquiry would shew that,\r\nas in geology, so here, the subject-matter lies in layers.  We have the\r\nprehistoric period concerning palæolithic and neolithic man; then follow\r\nthe British, the Roman, the Saxon, the Danish, and the Norman strata, or\r\neras; so many have been the elements which have contributed to the\r\nmoulding of our country and our people, as we find them at the present\r\nday.  But again, as in geology, so here, we find few traces in our own\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the earlier links in this series—the people\r\nwho preceded the historic Britons.  On Twig Moor, near Brigg, in the\r\nnorth of the county, a tract of ground very similar to our own Moor, many\r\nflint implements have been found.  On an excursion of our “Naturalists’\r\nUnion” to that tract, one of the party found “a handful” of stone “knives\r\nand finely-chipped arrow heads.” {105a}  The members of the same Society,\r\nvisiting Woodhall in 1893, found on the Moor “patches of pale-coloured\r\nsand, slightly ferruginous, and having a considerable number of flints,”\r\nbut none were found which could be said to shew traces of human use.\r\nThis, however, is no reason why the visitor to Woodhall should not search\r\nfor them.  That they exist in our neighbourhood has been proved, since a\r\ngood specimen of flint axe was found a few years ago by Mr. A. W. Daft,\r\non Highrigge farm, near Stobourne Wood, in Woodhall.  It is about five\r\ninches in length and 1¼ inches broad, and, from its high degree of\r\npolish, probably was the work of neolithic man. {105b}  Another, smaller,\r\nflint celt was found in 1895 by Mr. Crooks, of Woodhall Spa, in the\r\nparish of Horsington, near Lady-hole bridge, between Stixwould and\r\nTupholme.  Its length was 3½ inches, by 2½ inches in breadth, thickness\r\nabout ¾ inch.  More recently one was found in a field on the Stixwould\r\nroad by his son, about three inches in length and 1½ inches broad,\r\nthickness ¾ inch.  In 1904 several finely chipt flint arrow heads, about\r\none inch in length and breadth, were found in the parish of Salmonby,\r\nnear Horncastle, in a field called “Warlow Camp,” doubtless the site of a\r\nprehistoric settlement.  The present writer has picked up at odd times\r\nsome half dozen specimens, bearing more or less trace of human\r\nmanipulation, but none of them so well finished as those referred to.  A\r\nfarmer residing near the Moor, to whom I recently explained what a flint\r\nimplement was, said he had noticed several stones of that kind, but did\r\nnot know that they were worth picking up.  Two molar teeth of the Elephas\r\nprimigenius, or extinct mammoth, have been found in a pit at\r\nKirkby-on-Bain, situated between the road and the canal, about a quarter\r\nof a mile north-west of the church; {106a} and bones of Bos primigenius\r\nand Cervus elaphus were found among gravel and ice-scraped pebbles in a\r\npit, near Langworth bridge (not far from Bardney).  The former of these,\r\nthe gigantic Ox, or Urus, belonged to the palæolithic age, {106b} when\r\nthe first race of human beings peopled this land, but was extinct in the\r\nneolithic period in this country (though in a later age re-introduced).\r\nThe latter, which is our red-deer, survived in a wild state, in our\r\ncounty and neighbourhood, until comparatively modern times.  Large\r\nvertebræ, apparently of some huge Saurian, have been found, which the\r\nwriter has seen, in West Ashby; and a large mammoth tooth is preserved\r\namong the treasures of the late Mechanics’ Institute at Horncastle,\r\nhaving been found in the neighbourhood.  These are all the pre-historic\r\nrelics which I can find recorded in our neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nLater antiquities, of the British, Roman, and succeeding periods, are, or\r\nhave been, fairly plentiful; the misfortune being that, as we, as yet,\r\nhave no County Museum wherein they could be preserved, they have\r\ndoubtless many of them been lost, or, if kept in private hands, are\r\nunrecorded.\r\n\r\nWhen the bed of the Witham, by order of the Royal Commissioners, was\r\ncleansed in 1788, a number of swords, spears, arrow heads, etc., were\r\nfound on the hard clay bottom, which had been covered over, and so\r\npreserved, by the accumulated mud.  And in the “Gentleman’s Magazine” for\r\nthat year a list of them was given.  The late Sir Joseph Banks, of\r\nRevesby Abbey, secured a considerable number of such relics, catalogues\r\nof which are given in “Lincolnshire Notes & Queries,” Vols. III. and IV.\r\nThey consist of arms and utensils of our British, Roman, Saxon, and\r\nDanish ancestors.  Among the more interesting of these was a whittle, or\r\n“anelace,” exactly resembling one described by Greene as part of\r\nChaucer’s dress. {107}  In connection with Woodhall were the following:—A\r\nsword, probably Saxon, brought up from the Witham bed near “Kirkstead\r\nWath,” entangled in the prongs of an eel-stang.  The pommel and guard are\r\ntinned, as we now tin the inside of kitchen utensils; an art which we\r\nshould not have known that our forefathers at that period possessed but\r\nfor such discoveries as this.  The polish still remained on parts of the\r\nblade “admirably brilliant.”  It bore the inscription + Benvenutus + on\r\none side, and on the other + me fecit +, in Saxon characters; the name\r\nshewing that the maker was an Italian, the crosses probably implying that\r\nhe (or the owner, if made to order) was a Christian; while from the Saxon\r\nlettering we should infer that the Italian sword-cutler exercised his\r\ncraft in the north of Europe.  Another sword, with brass scabbard, of\r\nelegant workmanship and richly gilt, was found near Bardney.  Several\r\nmore swords, with Saxon and Roman inscriptions, were also found near\r\nBardney.\r\n\r\nA dagger was brought up by an eel-stang near “Kirkstead Wath,” the\r\nhandle, of elm, being in fairly good preservation, the only instance of\r\nwood thus surviving. {108a}  Several others, one of superior work with an\r\nivory handle, were found in the Witham near Bardney.\r\n\r\nA spear head of bone, of British structure, was found in Stixwould in an\r\nancient sewer, which was being cleansed.  Sir J. Banks says that “it does\r\ncredit to the skill of the person who made it.” {108b}  Several more of\r\nthese were found at Bardney and other parts of the Witham; and again at\r\n“Kirksted Wath” the eel-stang brought up an iron specimen, which from its\r\nappearance would seem to have been broken in action.\r\n\r\nA large barbed arrow head was found near Bardney, with an orifice large\r\nenough to receive a broom handle. {108c}\r\n\r\nA Roman lituus, or clarion, was found near Tattershall Ferry.  Though\r\nimperfect, both ends being broken off, it is interesting as being\r\nprobably the only one in existence.  This instrument is represented among\r\ntrophies on the base of Trojan’s column in Rome, and appears on some\r\nRoman coins. {108d}  A description is given in the “Archæologia” of the\r\nSociety of Antiquaries (Vol. XIV.) of an iron candlestick, of curious\r\nconstruction, being one of six which were found in the Witham by\r\nKirkstead.  We may well imagine that they, at one time, served to light\r\nthe refectory of the Abbey, where the monks of old dispensed hospitality\r\nto the poor and needy, or to the wayfaring stranger.  Perhaps the most\r\ninteresting relic of all is a British shield, of finely-wrought metal,\r\noriginally gilt, with a boss of carnelian, and ornamented with elaborate\r\ndevices, shewing that those primitive people, though living a rude life,\r\nhad attained to a very considerable degree of skill in working metals.\r\nIt is described in the “Archæologica” (Vol. XXIII.); and an engraving is\r\ngiven of it in “Fenland” by Skertchly and Miller (p. 463).  It was\r\nformerly in the Meyrick collection.\r\n\r\nThe above are a selection of the most interesting objects yielded up to\r\nus chiefly by the Witham; there have been many more, but of less\r\nimportance.  Several Roman urns in different places have been exhumed.\r\nThe parish of Thornton runs down to Kirkstead station, passing almost\r\nwithin a stone’s throw of the Victoria Hotel; and in Thornton a small\r\nRoman vase was discovered when the railroad was made, in 1854.  The\r\npresent writer has seen it, but it has, unfortunately, disappeared.  An\r\nengraving and description of it are given in the “Linc. Architectural\r\nSociety’s Journal,” Vol. IV., Part II., p. 200.  It was nine inches in\r\nheight, of rather rough construction, and with a rude ornamentation.  Two\r\nRoman urns, or, according to another account, six (“Lincolnshire N. & Q.”\r\nVol. III., p. 154), were also found at the north-east corner of a field,\r\non the road leading from Stixwould to Bucknall, about 3½ miles from\r\nWoodhall.  They were of the kind technically termed “smoke burnt.”  The\r\nsoil at the spot was a clay of so tenacious a character that several\r\nhorse-shoes, some of them of a very old and curious make, have been found\r\nin the former quagmire.  Several large Roman urns have been found in, or\r\nnear, Horncastle, and are preserved among the treasures of the late\r\nMechanics’ Institute, having been presented to the town by the sole\r\nsurviving trustee, Mr. Joseph Willson, to form, with other objects, the\r\nnucleus of a local museum at some future time.  Engravings of these also\r\nare given, with a Paper by Rev. E. Trollope, the late Bishop Suffragan of\r\nNottingham, in the abovementioned Journal, at p. 210.\r\n\r\nAt Ashby Puerorum, so called because certain lands in the parish go to\r\npay for the choristers of Lincoln Cathedral, in the year 1794, a\r\nlabourer, cutting a ditch, discovered, three feet below the surface, a\r\nRoman sepulture, a stone chest squared and dressed with much care, in\r\nwhich was deposited an urn of strong glass of greenish hue.  The chest\r\nwas of freestone, such as is common on Lincoln heath.  The urn, of\r\nelegant shape, contained human bones nearly reduced to ashes, and among\r\nthem a small lacrimatory of very thin green glass. {110a}\r\n\r\nOn the Mareham road, on the south side of Horncastle, beyond the Black\r\nSwan inn, was a Roman burial ground, and several cinerary urns and some\r\ncoffins have been discovered there.  One stone coffin now stands in the\r\nback premises of Mr. James Isle, near to the corner where the Spilsby and\r\nBoston roads meet.  In connection with this subject, I may here mention\r\nthe most recent archæological “find” in Horncastle.  While digging gravel\r\nin a pit recently opened in a garden at the back of Queen Street, not far\r\nfrom the Mareham Road, in 1897, the pick of the labourer struck against a\r\nhard substance, about two feet below the surface, which, on examination,\r\nproved to be an ancient coffin.  It was constructed, except the lid, of\r\none sheet of lead, slit at the corners to allow its being doubled up to\r\nform the sides and ends.  The coffin was 5ft. 2in. in length, and within\r\nwere the remains of a skeleton, pronounced by experts to be that of a\r\nfemale.  A few days later a second lead coffin was found, similar to the\r\nformer, except that it was 5ft. 7in. long, and the skeleton was\r\npronounced to be that of a man.  Both coffins lay east and west.  The\r\npresent writer was asked to investigate the matter.  On enquiry, it was\r\nfound that, about 24 years before, three lead coffins had been found\r\nwithin 100 yards of the same spot; they were sold for old lead and melted\r\ndown. {110b}  As Horncastle was the old Roman station Banovallum, the\r\nquestion arose whether these coffins were Roman, or of later, date.  The\r\norientation of both implied that they were Christian.  After much\r\ninteresting correspondence, the writer obtained the information from an\r\nantiquary of note, that if the lead was pure it would be of post-Roman\r\ndate, if it contained an admixture of tin it would most probably be\r\nRoman.  Analysis of the lead was made by a professional, which gave\r\n“percentage of tin 1.65 to 97.08 of lead, 1.3 of oxygen, which implied\r\nthat the persons buried were Romans, as well as Christians.  A peculiar\r\nfeature in these burials was that there were lumps of lime about the\r\nskeletons.  I find, however, that some years ago a lead coffin was\r\ndiscovered near the Roman road, which passes through the parish of Bow,\r\ncontaining a skeleton with lime. {111}  From its position near the Roman\r\nroad we should infer that this was a Roman burial, and the presence of\r\nlime confirms the origin of the Horncastle coffins.  The lime was\r\nprobably used as a preservative.  One of the coffins was sold for a\r\ncollection in Manchester, the other was bought by public subscription, to\r\nbe preserved for a future local museum.  In the same gravel pit, a few\r\ndays after the finding of the coffins, the labourer’s tool struck against\r\nanother object, which proved to be an earthenware vessel, probably a\r\nRoman urn, but it was so shattered that he threw the fragments away, and\r\nthey could not be recovered.  It was described as being about 10 inches\r\nhigh, of a brown colour, and bearing traces of a pattern running round\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSeveral old coins have been found in Horncastle, and some at Tattershall.\r\nAs to the latter place, Allen, in his “History,” vol. ii., p. 72, and\r\nWeir (“Historical Account of Lincolnshire,” vol. i., p. 302), say that\r\nseveral Roman coins have been found, but they do not specify what they\r\nwere.  There were two so-called “Roman camps” in what is called\r\nTattershall Park, this being supposed to be the Roman station Durobrivis.\r\nBut, alas! “Jam seges est, ubi Troja fuit”: the plough has eliminated the\r\ncamps from the field of view.  Roman coins would be a natural result of a\r\nRoman station.  It should not, however, be forgotten that Gough, Camden,\r\nand other authorities pronounce these camps to have been of British\r\norigin.  The earlier Britons used mainly a brass coinage, or iron bars\r\n(utuntur aut aere, aut taleis ferreis, says Cæsar, _Bell. Gall._, v. 12);\r\nso that there should not be much difficulty in deciding whether the coins\r\nwere those of British or Roman occupants.  Taught by the Romans, the\r\nlater Britons probably coined considerably.  The oldest specimens known\r\nto be coined at Lincoln bear the name of King Arthur.  Camden and Speed\r\ngive several.  At Horncastle, the oldest coin found was British, having\r\non one side, amid mystic circles, the figure of a “horse rampant,”\r\nindicative of the reverence in which the horse was held by the Druids.\r\n{112a}  Stukeley says, in his Diary, “a coign I got of Carausius found at\r\nHornecastle.  It had been silvered over.  The legend of the reverse is\r\nobscure.  It seems to be a figure, sitting on a coat of armour, or\r\ntrophy, with a garland in her left hand, and (legend) Victorii Aug.”\r\n{112b}  Silver coins of Vespasian, Lucius Septimius Severus, Alexander\r\nSeverus, and Volusianus, a large brass coin of Trajan, middle brass of\r\nCaligula, Claudius, Nero, Trajan, Hadrian, Domitian, Antoninus Pius,\r\nFaustina the elder, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, Lucius Verus, and Faustina\r\nthe younger, and several more. {112c}  In December, 1898, a coin was\r\nfound by a son of Mr. W. K. Morton, bookseller, while playing in the\r\ngarden at Onslow House, which proved to be one of the Emperor\r\nConstantine.\r\n\r\nIn deepening the bed of the river Bain to form the canal, in 1802, an\r\nornamental brass spur, part of a brass crucifix, and a dagger, were found\r\ntogether, at a short distance from the north basin of the canal; and the\r\nwriter once found, some quarter of a mile out of Horncastle, on Langton\r\nhill, the rowell of a spur, with very long spikes, probably at one time\r\nbelonging to a cavalier at the battle of Winceby.  He has also in his\r\npossession a pair of brass spurs, found not far from Winceby, massive and\r\nheavy, the spikes of the rowell being an inch in length.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to Woodhall Spa; and on the way pause for a moment on\r\nthe moor.  We have already mentioned a curious character, by name Dawson,\r\nbut more commonly called “Tab-shag,” who, within the memory of the writer\r\nand many more, lived as a kind of squatter, in his sod-built hut, close\r\nto “The Tower.”  A sort of living fossil was this individual, short in\r\nstature, dark in complexion, and with a piercing, almost uncanny, eye;\r\nroughly clad, and looking as though he were something of a stranger to\r\nsoap and water.  “What’s in a name?” said love-sick Juliet.  Yet the name\r\nwhich clung to this eccentric person probably had its significance.  In\r\none of the “Magic Songs” of the Finns (given in “Folklore,” vol. i., No.\r\niii., p. 827) a sort of demon is described as “Old Shaggy,” “the horror\r\nof the land,” “reared on a heather clump,” “living on the lee side of a\r\nstone,” corresponding much to the home and haunts of our Tab-shag.\r\nBrogden {113} says “Shag-foal” means “a hobgoblin supposed to haunt\r\ncertain places,” and a writer in the “Archæological Review” (for January,\r\n1890) says that “Shag” is an old term for an elf, or Brownie, or “goblin\r\ndwarf.”  He adds, “The Hog-boy, or Howe-boy, of the Orkneys, in\r\nLincolnshire is pronounced Shag-boy.”  An old lady, born at the beginning\r\nof the eighteenth century, is quoted, in “The Cornhill Magazine” (August,\r\n1882) as saying she had often heard of fairies and shag boys, but had\r\nnever seen one herself, “though lasses were often skeart (_i.e._, scared,\r\nfrightened) at them.”  And the weird-looking figure of Tab-shag, living\r\nin the peculiar way he did, in a kind of “brock,” or “how,” of his own\r\nconstruction, was not altogether unlike that of one of the “How folk,”\r\nthe “little people,” believed in by our superstitious forefathers, and\r\nwhose memory is perpetuated in the Folk’s glove (digitalis) of our heath;\r\nas he squatted on his “faerie-knowe” on the lee side of the old Tower, or\r\nroamed over the dreary moor at nightfall to startle the belated wayfarer.\r\n\r\nWhat may have been the meaning of the other element in his soubriquet is\r\nnot so easy to say.  There is a Cornish (and probably British) word\r\n“Tab,” which means turf (“Archæol. Journ.” vol. ii., No. 3, p. 199), and\r\nthat would suit this dweller on the heath; but it is more likely that\r\n“Tab” had a reference to the cat, “Tabby” being the term for a brindled\r\ncat.  And Bishop Harsnet, in his curious book on “The Superstitions of\r\nthe Day” (1605), says a witch, or elf, “can take the form of hare, mouse,\r\nor cat.”\r\n\r\nTabby is really a corruption of Tibby, and that is from Tybalt, the name\r\nof puss in the old Beast Epic of the middle ages.  Ben Johnson uses\r\n“tiberts” for cats; and Mercutio, in “Romeo and Juliet” (Act. iii., sc.\r\n1) addresses Tybalt, when wishing to annoy him, as “Tybalt, you rat\r\ncatcher . . .  King of cats” (Folk-etymology).\r\n\r\nThis prowler on the heath might well be likened to pussy prowling after\r\nmice, or higher game. {114a}  But elfs and bogies have now vanished from\r\nour sylvan glades, as the will o’ the wisp has from the fens and marshes,\r\nwhere the present writer has seen it.  Drainage, and schools, and\r\nnewspapers have banished alike such phenomena, and the belief in them;\r\nand Tab-shag, like many another equally harmless, and equally perhaps\r\nmisunderstood, creature, will soon be forgotten.\r\n\r\nOne more antiquarian discovery may here be noticed.  Much interest was\r\nexcited by an ancient canoe which was unearthed near Brigg, in North\r\nLincolnshire, in the year 1886, while some excavators were working on the\r\neast side of the river Ancholme.  It was constructed out of a single\r\ntree, which must have been a very large oak.  It was 48ft. in length; its\r\nwidth 5ft. at the widest part, and 4ft. at the narrowest.  It had three\r\ntransverse stays, also cut out of the solid.  It was distant from the\r\npresent river about 40 yards, lying due east and west, on what must have\r\nbeen a sloping beach.  It was completely buried in a bed of alluvial\r\nclay; one end being 5ft. below the surface, and the other 9ft. below.  It\r\nis fully described in an article, written by T. Tindall Wildridge, in\r\n“Bygone Lincolnshire” (1st series).  The writer gives other instances of\r\nsimilar discoveries—in the Medway in 1720, in the Rother (Kent) in 1822,\r\non the Clyde, etc.; various such boats, indeed, have been found on the\r\nClyde, and, in one case, what is further interesting, the boat had within\r\nit a beautifully-finished stone celt, thus connecting it with the race\r\nof, probably, the later stone period.  Several finds of this kind have\r\noccurred in our own river, the Witham, or near it.\r\n\r\nIn digging for the foundations of a house in the upper part of the High\r\nStreet, Lincoln, some 80 or 90 years ago, a boat was discovered fastened\r\nby a chain to a post, {114b} the spot being several yards higher than the\r\npresent level of the Witham; thus showing that, when the Witham was a\r\ntidal river, it rose at times considerably higher than it does now.\r\n\r\nIn 1816 an ancient canoe was found, {115a} some 8 feet below the surface,\r\nin cutting a drain, parallel to the Witham, about two miles below\r\nLincoln.  This, like the Brigg boat, was hollowed out of a single oak,\r\n38ft. long, and 3ft. at the widest part.  Another was found in 1818, in\r\ncutting a drain not far from the last, but was unfortunately destroyed by\r\nthe workmen before they knew what it was.  Its length was about the same\r\nas that of the previous boat, but it was 4½ft. wide.  Two more similar\r\ncanoes—“dugouts,” as they were technically termed—were found about the\r\nsame time in drain-cutting, in the same vicinity; and one of these was\r\npresented to the British Museum. {115b}  The Fen men used to call their\r\nboats “shouts,” from the Dutch “schuyt,” a wherry.  They propelled them\r\nalong the drains by a long pole, called a “poy.”  It would be too much to\r\nsay that all these vessels belonged to pre-historic man, because of the\r\npresence in one case of a flint implement, connecting it with the\r\nneolithic period.  Such boats have probably been used by all nations, at\r\nearly stages of their existence.  The Greek writer Hippocrates, about 400\r\nB.C., mentions the “monoxyle,” or one-tree boat; one has been found in\r\nthe Tunhovd Fyord in Norway.  The Russians of the 9th century, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Novgorod, used them, laden with slaves for the market.\r\nThe Goths of the 3rd century, as stated by Strabo, swept the Black Sea\r\nwith them; and Professor Righ says that they have been used until\r\ncomparatively modern times in Scandinavia; but at any rate these found in\r\nour fens belong to a period, apparently, when the fens were not yet\r\nformed, or, at most, were forming.—_Article on the Brigg Boat in_\r\n“_Byegone Lincolnshire_.”\r\n\r\nWe now come to a case nearer home.  The visitor who takes a stroll from\r\nthe cross roads by St. Andrew’s Church, along the Tattershall road,\r\nshortly after crossing the pellucid sewer, will see a large pond on his\r\nright, close to a farm yard; and on the other side, eastward, are two\r\nponds, about 80 yards from the road.  All these ponds are pits dug for\r\nclay, which was put on the somewhat light land to strengthen it.  The\r\npresent course of the sewer, now running in a straight line due east and\r\nwest, from Kirkby lane to the Witham, is artificial.  It formerly pursued\r\na tortuous course, and, on reaching the Tattershall road, flowed\r\nsouthward along the west side of that road, past what is now the Abbey\r\nLodge public-house, dividing into more than one channel on its way to the\r\nWitham.  This change was made soon after the Kirkstead estate passed, by\r\npurchase, from the Ellison family to that of the present proprietor, in\r\nthe year 1839, when great improvements were made in the farms; the woods,\r\n{116} which then reached from the Moor ground to the Tattershall road,\r\nwere cleared away, and much land brought into cultivation which had\r\nhitherto been waste, or forest.  In digging for clay some 150 yards\r\neastward from the road, and about the same distance, or a little more,\r\nsouth of the present course of the sewer, the labourers came upon the\r\nskeleton of a boat several feet below the surface.  I am not able to\r\ndiscover whether it was a so-called “dug-out,” formed from one trunk, or\r\nconstructed, as modern boats are, of several planks.  Probably it would\r\nbe the latter.  But its position several feet below the surface would\r\nseem to imply considerable antiquity; while its mere existence would seem\r\nto indicate that either the sewer was formerly a larger stream than it is\r\nnow, to float such a boat, or that the waters of the Witham, when\r\nunconfined by such a bank as the present, extended to this point inland.\r\nA circumstance which confirms the supposition of the sewer being larger\r\nis the fact that about this same place it is known that there was a\r\nmill-dam, and doubtless the stream turned the mill-wheel.  The boat in\r\nquestion may not, therefore, like some of those previously mentioned,\r\nhave belonged to pre-historic man; and yet it might well lay claim to an\r\nantiquity sufficiently hoar to make it a relic of some interest.  But,\r\nthough so long preserved beneath the surface, once above ground, it soon\r\nperished, and even the memory of it only remains with a few.\r\n\r\nThe visitor to Woodhall, who has antiquarian proclivities, may well spend\r\nan enjoyable day at Lincoln, not only for the sake of seeing the\r\nCathedral, which is unsurpassed by any in the kingdom, or, rather, as has\r\nbeen said by no less an authority than Ruskin, “worth any two others”; or\r\nof visiting the Castle, founded by the Conqueror; but there are many\r\nother objects of much interest.  One of the most important discoveries of\r\nrecent years is the remains of a Roman basilica, found beneath the house\r\nof Mr. Allis, builder, in Bailgate, where a small fee is charged for\r\nadmission.  This has been pronounced by an authority, the late Precentor\r\nVenables, to have been “the finest Roman building in the kingdom.”  Its\r\nlength was 250 feet, width 70 feet, and it had stately pillars rising to\r\na height of 30 feet.  Beyond this is the fine old Newport Arch, the only\r\nRoman city gate in the kingdom.  “The noblest remnant of this sort in\r\nBritain,” says Leland.  He will do well to furnish himself with the\r\n“Pocket Guide to Lincoln,” by the late Sir Charles Anderson, one of our\r\ngreatest authorities, and “A Walk through Lincoln,” by the late learned\r\nPrecentor Venables, a compendium rich in historic lore.  Either of these\r\nwill prove a valuable Vade mecum, but the former, perhaps, more for the\r\nstudy, to be perused before his visit; the latter a manual for the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nIt may be added that, within quite recent years, the visitor to Lincoln\r\nfound himself at once, on landing from the train, in an atmosphere of\r\nantiquity, for, on emerging from the station of the G. N. Railway, he\r\nwould see over the door of a shop, full of modern utensils, facing the\r\ngate of the station yard, the name “Burrus,” Cooper, a genuine Roman\r\npatronymic, the bearer of which we may well suppose to have been a lineal\r\ndescendant of some early Roman colonist, settled at Lindum Colonia, “a\r\ncitizen of no mean city,” for Precentor Venables reminds us (“A Walk\r\nthrough Lincoln,” p. 9) it is one (with Colchester and Cologne) of the\r\nonly three cities which still preserve, embedded in their names, the\r\ntraces of their ancient distinction as Roman colonies.\r\n\r\nBy way of whetting the appetite for further enquiry, I give here a\r\nsuccinct catena of historic items, shewing the many interesting memories\r\nwhich cluster round our ancient cathedral city.\r\n\r\nLincoln was the British Caer-Lind-coit, the “Fortress (or City) of River\r\nand Wood,” these being the chief features of the position; the river, a\r\nsacred British stream, which carved out for itself its channel through\r\n“the Lincoln Gap”; and the woods (Welsh, or British, ‘coed,’ a wood)\r\nwhich stretched far away for miles around it; of the remains of which De\r\nla Prime says, “infinite millions of roots and bodies of trees have been\r\nfound, of 30 yards length and above, and have been sold to make masts and\r\nkeels for ships . . . as black as ebony, and very durable.” {118a}  Then,\r\nas the city took the last element of its name from its woods (coeds), so\r\nthe people who dwelt around were called Coitani, or woodmen {118b};\r\ncorresponding to the name given to the dwellers in the fens, Gir-vii, or\r\nmen of the cars.  Lincoln was the royal city of the Coitani.\r\n\r\nDuring the Roman occupation the Britons were christianized.  After the\r\nRomans left the country, the people having, through the long period of\r\npeace, almost lost the art of war, the British chief Vortigern called in\r\nthe Saxons from the continent to aid him against the inroads of the Picts\r\nand Scots; and Hengist and Horsa, Saxon chiefs, came with a large\r\nfollowing and settled in the country (circa A.D. 450).  Vortigern, with\r\ntheir assistance, repelled those northern marauders, and himself married\r\nRowena, daughter of Hengist, giving to Hengist, in return for his aid,\r\nconsiderable lands—“multos agros,” says Matthew of Westminster {118c}—in\r\nLindsey.\r\n\r\nBut these so-called friends soon proved to be enemies, and, in 462,\r\nseized London, York, and Lincoln.  Vortimer, son of Vortigern, died and\r\nwas buried at Lincoln.  Vortigern himself retired into Wales, and was\r\nburnt in his castle there, in 485.\r\n\r\nMatthew of Westminster records that King Arthur of “the round table”\r\npursued a Saxon army as far as Lincoln, having defeated them, with a loss\r\nof 6,000 men, in a wood near Barlings.\r\n\r\nThe Saxons, being ultimately victorious, re-introduced Paganism, the\r\nnames of their gods still surviving in our day-names, Tuesday (Tuisco),\r\nWednesday (Woden), Thursday (Thor), Friday (Friga), Saturday (Seater).\r\n\r\nAmong the kingdoms of the Saxon Heptarchy, Mercia was the largest and\r\nmost important division, {118d} founded by the chief Crida in A.D. 584,\r\nand Lincoln is said to have been its capital city.\r\n\r\nPaulinus preached Christianity among the Saxons (circa A.D. 630), and\r\nconverted Blecca, the governor of Lincoln, where a stone church was\r\nbuilt, said by some to have been the first stone church in the kingdom,\r\n{119a} that at Glastonbury being made of wattles.  The Venerable Bede\r\nsays it was of excellent workmanship. {119b}  Two churches in Lincoln\r\nhave claimed to represent this ancient fabric.\r\n\r\nAt a later period the Humber formed a highway for the marauding Danes,\r\nwho overran the country, and, if in nothing else, have left their traces\r\nin every village-name ending in “by.”  In their time Lincoln was the\r\nfirst city of the Pentapolis, or Quinque Burgi, of Fifburg, a league of\r\nthe five confederate towns, Lincoln, Nottingham, Derby, Leicester, and\r\nStamford.  Before the Norman Conquest Lincoln was the fourth city in the\r\nkingdom, and during the 11th and 12th centuries it was one of the\r\ngreatest trading towns in the kingdom.  The castle was founded by the\r\nConqueror, A.D. 1086, being one of four which he erected at York,\r\nNottingham, Hastings and here; and 166 “mansions” were destroyed to\r\nprovide space for it. {119c}\r\n\r\nThe Empress Maud, in 1140, took up her residence in Lincoln, and strongly\r\nfortified the castle.  It was besieged by Stephen, who was defeated and\r\nmade prisoner at the battle of Lincoln.  A prophecy had long been current\r\nto this effect,—\r\n\r\n    “The first crowned head that enters Lincoln’s walls,\r\n    His reign proves stormy, and his kingdom falls.”\r\n\r\nOn Stephen’s restoration he visited Lincoln in triumph, wearing his\r\ncrown; but subsequent events verified the prediction.\r\n\r\nAt Lincoln, in 1200, William the Lion, of Scotland, did homage to King\r\nJohn of England.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Queen Eleanor, the beloved wife of Edward I., at Harby, a\r\nsmall hamlet of North Clifton, Notts, the embalmed body was taken to\r\nWestminster for burial, but the viscera were brought to Lincoln and\r\ninterred in the Cathedral, A.D. 1290.\r\n\r\nIn 1301 Edward I. held a Parliament in Lincoln, to decide on sending\r\nletters to Rome to Pope Boniface VIII., asserting England’s independence\r\nof the Pope.\r\n\r\nIn 1305 Edward I. kept his court in Lincoln a whole winter, and held\r\nanother Parliament, in which he confirmed the Magna Charta of King John.\r\n{120a}\r\n\r\nA Parliament was also held in Lincoln by Edward II., and another, in his\r\nfirst year, by Edward III.\r\n\r\nIn 1352 the staple of wool was removed from Flanders to England; and\r\nLincoln, with Westminster, Chichester, Canterbury, Bristol, and Hull, was\r\nmade a staple town {120b} for that commodity.\r\n\r\nJohn, of Gaunt, fourth son of Edward III., resided in Lincoln Castle.\r\nHis son, “Henry of Bolingbroke,” afterwards Henry IV., was the only king\r\nborn in this county.  John of Gaunt married Catherine Swynford, sister of\r\nChaucer the poet.  She and a daughter were interred in the Cathedral, on\r\nthe south side of the altar steps.  The royalty of Lincoln Castle was\r\nshewn by a shield over a doorway, bearing the arms of England and France,\r\nquarterly, which were shewn in Buck’s engraving, date 1727.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1386 Richard II. visited Lincoln and held a Court in the\r\nEpiscopal Palace.  He granted to the Mayor and his successors the\r\nprivilege of having a sword carried before them in civic processions.\r\n\r\nHenry VI. visited Lincoln and held a Court at the Bishop’s Palace in\r\n1440.\r\n\r\nHenry VII. visited Lincoln in 1486, and was right royally entertained.\r\n\r\nOn the dissolution of monasteries {120c} by Henry VIII., Lincoln became\r\nthe headquarters of 60,000 insurgents, who, by the subsequent “Pilgrimage\r\nof Grace,” made their protest against the spoliation, A.D. 1536.\r\n\r\nIn 1541 Henry VIII. made a progress to York, and, although he had called\r\nLincolnshire one of “the most brute and beastly shires in the realm,” he,\r\non his way, visited Lincoln in great state.  It is recorded that he found\r\nin the Cathedral Treasury 2,621 ozs. of gold and 4,285 ozs. of silver,\r\nbesides jewels of great value.\r\n\r\nOn the commencement of the Civil Wars between Charles I. and his\r\nParliament, the King came to Lincoln, where he received assurances of\r\nsupport from the Corporation and principal inhabitants.  He convened\r\nthere a meeting of the nobles, knights, gentry, and freeholders of the\r\ncounty.  Lincoln Castle was taken by the troops of Cromwell, under the\r\nEarl of Manchester, in the year 1644.\r\n\r\nJames I. visited Lincoln A.D. 1617, hunted wild deer on Lincoln Heath,\r\ntouched 50 persons for “the King’s evil,” attended service in the\r\nCathedral, and cockfighting at “The Sign of the George.” {121a}\r\n\r\nIn 1695 William of Orange visited Lincoln, but it is on record that,\r\nbeing entertained the day before by Sir John Brownlow, at Belton, “the\r\nking was exceeding merry there, and drank very freely, which was the\r\noccasion, when he came to Lincoln, he could take nothing but a porringer\r\nof milk.” {121b}  In Lincolnshire phrase, he had been “very fresh.”\r\n\r\nReviewing these historic items, I think we may say, with the historian\r\nFreeman, that Lincoln “kept up its continuous being, as a place of note\r\nand importance, through Roman, English, Danish, and Norman Conquests,”\r\nand that it has a record of which we may fairly be proud, as meriting the\r\npraise which old Alexander Necham, in his treatise “De divina Sapientia,”\r\nbestowed upon it,”\r\n\r\n    Lindisiæ columen Lincolnia, sive columna,\r\n       Munifica felix gente, repleta bonis.\r\n\r\nI have said little of the Cathedral.  That is, indeed, too large a\r\nsubject.  The visitor must see it for himself.  I have referred to the\r\nopinion of Mr. Ruskin.  His exact words, written at the time of the\r\nopening of the School of Art, to the Mayor, were these: “I have always\r\nheld, and am prepared against all comers to maintain, that the Cathedral\r\nof Lincoln is out and out the most precious piece of architecture in the\r\nBritish islands, worth any two other cathedrals we have got.” {121c}\r\nViewed in the distance, from the neighbourhood of Woodhall Spa, its three\r\ntowers seem to coalesce into one, almost of pyramidal form, to crown the\r\nhill on which it stands.  That form was once more lofty, and more\r\npointed, for each of the three towers had a spire.  An entry in the\r\nMinster Archives records the fall of the largest—ruina magnæ pyramidis—in\r\n1547.  In 1808 the two other lesser spires were taken down, not without\r\nstrong remonstrances and much skirmishing in the public papers and\r\nelsewhere, as to the propriety of the act.  The Lincoln people proved\r\nthemselves more law-abiding than they had been on a previous occasion,\r\nfor when, in 1726, the Chapter had decided to remove them, there was a\r\nvery considerable riot, called “The Religious Mob,” of which an amusing\r\naccount was found among some MS.\r\n\r\n    “_Tuesday night_, _Sept._ 20, 1726, _a mob was raised in Lincoln to\r\n    hinder the puling down the_ 2 _west End spirs of the Cathedrall_,\r\n    _which was then began to be puled down it was computed ther was\r\n    aBout_ 4 _or_ 500 _men_.  _On Wednesday following by orders of the\r\n    Marsters of the Church sent an order to the Mayor and Aldermen\r\n    desiering them to send a Belman through the town with this cry_,\r\n    _whereas there as Been a Tumult for this_ 2 _or_ 3 _Long Day_, _upon\r\n    puling the_ 2 _west end Spirs of the Cauthed Church of Lincoln_,\r\n    _this is to give satisfaction that they have made a stop’ and that\r\n    the spirs shall be repaired again with all speed_.”\r\n\r\nOn hearing this important proclamation “the mob with one accord gave a\r\ngreat shout and said ‘God bless the King.’”\r\n\r\nThe emeute terminated with no more serious results than some headaches\r\nthe next day, as the beer barrels in the Chancellor’s cellars were\r\nbroached and drained to the last drop by the exultant crowd. {122}\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of Lincoln is the ancient “Jew’s House,” situated\r\non the left hand of “the street which is called strait,” on the “Steep\r\nHill.”  The Jews of old, notwithstanding the scorn with which they were\r\noften treated, were persons of no small consideration to almost all\r\nranks, from the Sovereign downwards.  Their almost instinctive propensity\r\nfor amassing wealth gave them a powerful lever for moving any who were in\r\nneed of the moneylender; and there were few who were not.  Through them,\r\nand sometimes through them alone, the sovereign could indirectly break\r\nthe power of his unruly barons, and, naturally, in a city of commerce\r\nsuch as Lincoln was, as well as the not unfrequent seat of Parliament,\r\nand the residence of powerful members of the nobility, the Jews were an\r\nimportant element in the population.  Among the “Pipe Rolls” of the\r\n“Public Records,” there are frequent mentions of them; the famous Aaron\r\nand his kinsfolk figuring largely among them.  I here give a few brief\r\nextracts taken from those Rolls (31 Henry I. [1130–1]—1 John\r\n[1199–1200]).\r\n\r\nWilliam of the Isle renders count of the ferm of Lincolnshire . . . and\r\n(cr.) by payment of King’s Writ to Aaron the Jew, £29 8s. l0d. . . . owes\r\n£12 4s. 9d.  He renders count of the same debt in the treasury £2 6s. 9d.\r\nnew money, for £2 4s. 9d. blank money, and £10 in two tallies, and is\r\nquits.—12 Hen. II., Rot. i. mem. i. Linc.\r\n\r\nThe Sheriff accounts for the ferm of the counties, And (cr.) by payment\r\nby King’s writ to Aaron of Lincoln and Ysaac Jew £80.—22 Hen. II., Dorset\r\nand Somerset.\r\n\r\nBenedict brother of Aaron, and Benedict son of Isaach, and Benedict son\r\nof Jaocb render count of £6 for one mark of gold to be quits of the\r\npledges of Isaac son of Comitissa.—25 Hen. II., City of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe following looks very like Jews leaguing together to “Jew” a fellow\r\nJew:—Brun the Jew owes £400 of the fine he made with the King at his\r\ntransfretation; but they ought to be required from Aaron of Lincoln, and\r\nYsáác, and Abraham, son of Rabbi, and Ysáác of Colchester, his sureties,\r\nwho have acknowledged that they received those £400 from his chattels.—28\r\nHen. II., Lond. and Midd.\r\n\r\nBenedict, brother of Aaron, renders count of £6 for one mark of gold, to\r\nhave in peace his mortgage of Barewe (_i.e._, Barrow).  Abraham, son of\r\nAaron, owes £6 for one mark of gold to have his debts (settled).—29 Hen.\r\nII., Linc.\r\n\r\nBrun the Jew renders count of £1,000 out of the 2,000 marks of the fine\r\nhe made with the King, and of which Aaron of Lincoln has to answer for\r\n500 marks.—30 Hen. II., Lond.\r\n\r\nThe following again looks suspiciously like a bit of Jewish sharp\r\npractice:—Jacob, sister’s son of Aaron, and Benedict his son, owe one\r\nmark of gold, because they kept back the charters of Benedict of the\r\nBail, which had been acquitted.—31 Hen. II., Linc.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, as a succeeding entry, we find that:—Benedict of the Bail\r\nowes 4 bezants, for him, and for fat Manasses, and Vives son of\r\nDeulcresse, and Josoe, son of Samuel, to have their charters from\r\nBenedict, son of Jacob, and from Jacob, sister’s son of Aaron.—31 Hen.\r\nII., Linc.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, honesty is the best policy, as shewn in the result of\r\ncrafty dealing, in the following:—Benedict, son of Aaron, owes 20 marks\r\nfor right to £4 8s. 8d., against Meus the Jew of Lincoln; where Benedict\r\nhas to pay more than three times the amount of the debt to obtain it.\r\n\r\nThe following seems to point to a playful practical joke:—Jacob, Aaron’s\r\nsister’s son, renders count of 20 marks, for an amerciament, for taking\r\noff a priest’s cap, and for the deed of Gerard de Sailby.—33 Hen. II.,\r\nLinc.\r\n\r\nAaron Jew, of Lincoln, Abraham son of Rabbi, and Isaac of Colchester, owe\r\n£400 of the chattels of Brun the Jew, which they received in old money,\r\nof the fine which he made with the King at his crossing over the straits\r\n(otherwise called his “transfretation”).—1 Ric. I., Lond. and Weston.\r\n\r\nOf the debts of Aaron of Lincoln, 430 are named, amounting to about\r\n£1,500, a very large sum in those days.—Rolls, 3–5 Ric. I.\r\n\r\nHere again we have a case of Jewish trickery:—Ursell, son of Pulcella,\r\nowes 5 marks because he did not give up to Ysaac his debt, and Matathias\r\nthe Jew owes half a mark because he has confessed what he previously\r\ndenied.—3 Ric. I., Linc.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Richard I. anti-semitic feeling ran high.  In a Roll, 3\r\nRic. I., Chent (Kent), we find:—The town of Ospringe owes 20 marks\r\nbecause it did not make a hue and cry for a slain Jew.  In another, 4\r\nRic. I., we find:—Richard Malebysse renders count for 20 marks, for\r\nhaving his land again, which had been seized in the hand of the king on\r\naccount of the slaughter of Jews at York.  William de Percy, Knight,\r\nRoger de Ripun, and Alan Malekuke owe 5 marks for the same.  In Lincoln,\r\nhowever, it has been generally supposed that the Jews escaped violent\r\ntreatment, but in a Roll, 3 Ric. I., Linc., there is a list of 80 names\r\nof men of the city fined, as “amerciament for assault on the Jews.”\r\n\r\nThere are several more mentions of transactions of Lincoln Jews, but\r\nthese will suffice.—“Archæol. Review,” Vol. ii., No. vi., pp. 398–410.\r\n\r\nThere were at one time 52 churches in Lincoln besides the Cathedral; now\r\nthey number 15.  There were also in the city 14 monasteries.  Honorius,\r\nthe fifth Archbishop of Canterbury, was consecrated by Paulinus in\r\nLincoln, in 627.\r\n\r\nServices in some of the churches have been held somewhat irregularly even\r\nin this cathedral city, for in answer to queries from the Bishop in 1743,\r\nit was found that in St. Bennet’s there was divine service once a month,\r\nand twice on the greater festivals.  St. Mark’s had services on the three\r\ngreater festivals, and four times a year besides.  St. Martin’s had\r\nservices four or five times a year, St. Mary le Wigford once every\r\nSunday.  An epitaph in the churchyard of the last-named church, on an old\r\ntombstone, a specimen of Lindocolline wit, runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n    Here lies one—believe it, if you can—\r\n    Who, though an attorney, was an honest man. {125}\r\n\r\nWe have only to add that when Remigius of Fecamp, the first Norman\r\nBishop, presided over the See of Lincoln, his diocese was far the largest\r\nin England, extending from the Humber to the Thames, and embracing no\r\nless than eight counties.  It was reduced to something like its present\r\ndimensions on the appointment of Bishop Kaye in 1827; except that, since\r\nthen, a portion has been taken off and included in the new Diocese of\r\nSouthwell.  Truly our bishops were princes in those olden times.\r\n\r\nYet, interesting as Lincoln is, to the archæologist one thing is lacking,\r\nviz., a fitting museum, wherein to bring together, tabulate, and conserve\r\nthe many precious relics of the past, which are now scattered about in\r\nprivate hands, and liable to all sorts of accidents.  When we visit such\r\ncollections as those in the museums at Newcastle or Nottingham—even the\r\nlimited and crowded, but very interesting, one at Peterborough, and,\r\nabove all the very fine collection (especially of Roman antiquities) at\r\nYork—we are tempted to exclaim, with a sigh of regret, “O! si sic omnes!”\r\nAt Lincoln, colossal fortunes have been, made in the old “staple city,”\r\nnow vastly grown, and growing, in its trade; will not some one, or more,\r\nof her wealthy sons come forward, and build, and endow, a museum worthy\r\nof the place, and while there are yet so many priceless treasures\r\navailable to enrich it?  The Corporation, indeed, have, in the year of\r\ngrace 1904, commenced at last a movement toward establishing a county\r\nmuseum, but no site is yet secured for it.  A few objects, chiefly of\r\nNatural History, are already placed for safety in the Castle, till better\r\naccommodation can be provided.\r\n\r\nWe now return to some remains, possessing considerable antiquarian\r\ninterest, in our neighbourhood, within easy reach for the visitor to\r\nWoodhall Spa, and belonging to a period later than that of the Briton, or\r\nRoman, or even the Saxon and the Dane; when, as the poet says:—\r\n\r\n    Another language spread from coast to coast,\r\n    Only perchance some melancholy stream,\r\n    Or some indignant hills old names preserve,\r\n    When laws, and creeds, and people, all are lost.\r\n\r\nThe name Woodhall implies the existence, at one time, of a hall in a\r\nwood, and that of sufficient importance to give its name to the whole\r\ndemesne. {126a}  Of such a building we have the traces.\r\n\r\nThe reader of these pages will have learnt that Woodhall Spa is but a\r\nmodern creation, in what was, not long ago, an outlying corner of the\r\nparish from which it gets its name.  The original village of Woodhall,\r\ncomprising a few scattered farmhouses and cottages near the church, is\r\ndistant some four miles from the Spa.  The church will be more fully\r\ndescribed in another chapter; it is here merely referred to as a landmark\r\nin connection with this “hall.”  Immediately adjoining the churchyard, on\r\nthe south and south-east, are a farmhouse and buildings of no great age;\r\nbut directly south of these, and within 150 yards of the church, is the\r\nsite of the ancient Wood-Hall.  There is the hollow of a former moat,\r\nenclosing an area of about 120 feet by 90 feet, and beyond this can be\r\ntraced the channel of a dike, which would seem to have connected the moat\r\nwith a small, but limpid, stream, {126b} locally called, by the Norse\r\nterm, “beck,” which rises in the gravel, some mile and a half distant\r\neastward, in the parish of Thornton, not far from Langton hill; and\r\nwhich, passing Woodhall, finds its way, by Poolham and Stixwould, into\r\nthe Witham.  Covering a space of some two acres, there are mounds,\r\nbeneath which, doubtless, was the _debris_ of what must, in their day,\r\nhave been extensive buildings.  They are dotted about with gnarled\r\nhawthorns of considerable antiquity; but otherwise the wood is now\r\nconspicuous only by its absence.\r\n\r\nMr. Denton says (“England in the 15th Century,” p. 252, Bell & Sons,\r\n1888), “the ancient hall or manor house was usually moated for the\r\npurpose of defence,” in times which were apt to be lawless; and in the\r\ncase of the “Moated Grange” connected with a greater religious house,\r\nthere was the further advantage of the ready supply of fish for the\r\nrestricted diet of the monks, amongst whom, except for sick members,\r\nanimal food was prohibited.\r\n\r\nI have said that the Wood-Hall, or Hall in the Wood, must have been\r\nsufficiently important to give its name to the demesne.  It may be\r\ndoubted, however, whether the name Woodhall has always applied to the\r\nwhole parish, now so called.  In Camden’s “Britannia,” written about\r\n1586, Gibson’s Edition being 1695, although the names of all the\r\nadjoining parishes appear in his map, that of Woodhall is absent, {127}\r\nand in its place we find “Buckland.”  This latter name still survives in\r\n“Buckland lane,” given in the Award Map, in the north of the parish, and\r\nnear to which, within the writer’s memory, there remained a tract of\r\nwaste, and wild woodland.  This name, therefore, is interesting, as\r\nindicating the former presence of the wild deer in our neighbourhood.  It\r\nis, as it were, the still uneffaced “slot” of the roaming stag,—a\r\nfootprint in the sand of time, still visible.  And, since this Buckland\r\nlane leads to nowhere beyond itself, we may well imagine it to have been\r\na sort of _cul-de-sac_, a sylvan retreat, in which especially the\r\nantlered herds did congregate from the larger wood of the Manor Hall;\r\nand, in connection with this, we may notice that, not far from this lane,\r\nthere still remain two woods, named Dar-wood, which may be taken, by an\r\neasy transition, to represent Deer-wood; further indicating the wild\r\nforest character of the demesne.  Buckland lane terminates at a small\r\nenclosure, now known, for some unrecorded reason, as “America,” the sole\r\nplot of land, besides the churchyard, remaining in the parish attached to\r\nthe church.  The modern incumbent may indulge his fancy by supposing\r\nthat, notwithstanding the strict monastic rule, this bit of church land\r\nmay, in the olden day, occasionally have furnished a “fatte buck” for the\r\ntable of the lordly Abbot of Kirkstead. {128a}  In the Liber Regis, or\r\nKing’s Book, issued by Commissioners under Henry VIII., the benefice is\r\ncalled Wood Hall; but it would seem, from what has been given above, that\r\nit was not until a later period that the whole Civil Parish became known\r\nby that name.  There is nothing to show who were the occupants of this\r\nWood Hall, but, until the Reformation, they probably held it in fee from\r\nthe Abbots of Kirkstead.  One little evidence of the connection with the\r\ngreat religious house survived, till within the last few years, in the\r\nHoly Thistle (Carduus Marianus), which grew in an adjoining field, as it\r\nalso did about the ruin of Kirkstead Abbey, but it is now, it is\r\nbelieved, extinct.  The monks found an innocent recreation in gardening,\r\nbut they are gone, and even their plants have followed them.\r\n\r\nIn this same parish, and within two miles of this old Wood Hall, are the\r\ntraces of another similar ancient establishment, viz., High-hall.  We\r\nhave already stated that Brito, son of Eudo, the Norman Baron of\r\nTattershall, gave to the Abbots of Kirkstead two portions of the parish\r\nof Woodhall, which would seem to imply that he retained the third portion\r\nfor himself. {128b}  In that case this residence of the superior Lord of\r\nthe Manor might naturally be distinguished from the Wood Hall by the\r\ntitle of the High Hall; and the traces of it which remain indicate that\r\nit was on a larger scale than the former.  The position is in the second\r\nfield northward from the road called “‘Sandy lane,” which is the boundary\r\nbetween the Woodhall Spa Civil district and Old Woodhall, and just\r\noutside, westward, the present High-hall Wood, which formerly extended\r\nfurther than it now does, so as completely to shelter this hall from the\r\nnorth and east.  There are traces of three moated enclosures, from 70\r\nyards to 100 yards in length east and west, and from 40 yards to 60 yards\r\nin width, covering an area of some three acres.  Here, also, as at\r\nWoodhall, the moats, for the sake of fresh water, are connected by a\r\nchannel with a running stream near at hand, though now at this point only\r\nsmall, named Reed’s Beck, which rises within the High-Hall Wood.\r\n\r\nAt what date this old Hall fell into decay we have no means of knowing.\r\nThe turf which now covers its foundations has at some time been levelled,\r\nand beyond slight indications of walls in the central of the three\r\nenclosures, the moats alone survive to shew its extent.  The writer is in\r\npossession of an interesting relic, an old pistol of curious workmanship,\r\nwhich was found near the place by Mr. Atkinson, of the farm adjoining, in\r\ndigging a ditch.  The peculiar make of the weapon would seem to indicate\r\nthat it was of the date of about Charles I.; {129} in which case we may\r\nsuppose that the Hall was at that time occupied as a residence, and the\r\npistol, being of French manufacture and rather handsomely chased, may\r\nhave belonged to the wealthy occupant of the mansion; or, perhaps more\r\nlikely, may have been part of the accoutrements of a cavalier of rank in\r\nthe Royalist army, which, after their defeat at the battle of Winceby,\r\nnear Horncastle, Oct. 11, 1643, was dispersed over the whole of this\r\nneighbourhood; and a fugitive officer may have sought shelter and\r\nhospitality at the High-Hall.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little remarkable that there should have been these two\r\nHalls, so near to each other and within the one parish; but they\r\nrepresent to us the lay, and the ecclesiastical, powers that were.\r\n\r\nThere were, also, other large, moated, ancient residences in our\r\nimmediate neighbourhood, but in this chapter I confine myself to the two\r\nsituated in Woodhall.  The others will claim attention hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.  ARCHÆOLOGY—_continued_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was stated in the preceding chapter, that, besides the two ancient\r\nmoated mansions in the parish of Woodhall, there described, there are\r\nother remains of a like character in our immediate neighbourhood.  I will\r\nfirst mention a residence, the site of which I have not been able\r\ndefinitely to fix, but it would probably be somewhere near the Manor\r\nHouse of Woodhall Spa.  I have before me a copy of a will preserved at\r\nthe Probate Office, Lincoln, {131} which begins thus:—“The 6th of Dec.,\r\n1608, I, Edmund Sherard of Bracken-End, in the parish of Woodhall, and\r\ncounty of Lincoln, gente., sicke in bodye, but of perfect memorie, do\r\nwill,” &c.  We may pause here to notice that the name “Bracken-End” would\r\nseem to imply that the residence stood at an extreme point of what is now\r\n“Bracken” wood, and, as the position would naturally be viewed in its\r\ngeographical relation to the centre of the parish, either to the Woodhall\r\nby the parish church, or to the manorial High Hall, this point, we may\r\nassume, would be on the far, or south, side of Bracken wood, as the\r\npresent Manor House is.  In a similar manner a row of houses in\r\nKirkstead, from their outlying situation, are called “Town-end.”  In an\r\nold document, in Latin (Reg. III., D. & C.D. 153), mention is made of\r\n“Willelmus Howeson de Howeson-end”; and the residence of Lord Braybrooke,\r\nin Cambridgeshire, is named Audley End.  There are known to have been a\r\nsuccession of buildings on the site of the present Woodhall Manor House,\r\nand we can hardly doubt that the residence here referred to as\r\n“Bracken-end” also stood there.\r\n\r\nThe will is of further interest as shewing the testator’s connection and\r\ndealings with members of families of position once, or still, well known\r\nin the neighbourhood or county.\r\n\r\nHis first bequest is (that which is the common lot of us all) “my bodye\r\nto the earth whence it came.”  He then goes on to bequeath certain sums\r\n“To Susanna my weif . . .  To Elizabeth Sherard my daughter . . .  To my\r\nsonne Robert . . .  To the child my weif is conceaved with . . .  The\r\nportions to be payde when my son Robert is xxj. years of age, and my\r\ndaughters’ portions when they are xx., or shall marrie.  My executur to\r\nkeepe and maintaine my children,” &c.  He then wills that, in accordance\r\nwith “an arbitrament between Sir John Meares, of Awbrowy (Aukborough), in\r\nthe county of Lincoln, knight,” and another, “with the consent of Willm.\r\nSherard, of Lope-thorpe, in the parish of North Witham, knight, on the\r\none partie, and I, the said Edmund Sherard, of the other partie . . .\r\nthat the said William Sherard shall be accomptable . . . every yeare, of\r\nthe goods and chattles of John Sherard, late of Lincoln, gent., deceased”\r\n. . . and, “I desire my said brother William Sherard, knight, . . . that\r\nhe should discharge the same accordinglie to the benefit of my weif and\r\nchildren.  Item, that Robert Thomson, my Father-in-law, shall have all my\r\nsheepe in Bracken End, which I bought of him, and owe for only fourty of\r\nthem; that he shall paye to my wief for them vs. iiijd. (5s. 4d.)\r\napeece.”  He then mentions as “debts dewe”:—“John Ingrum of Bucknall for\r\nsheepe of lord Willoughbie xijli.; Edward Skipwith of Ketsby, gent, for\r\nlx. sheep xxvvijli.; and if he refuse the sheepe, to pay to my executrix\r\nxls., which the Testator payde for sommering them: Edward Skipwith to be\r\naccomptable for the wool of the sayde sheepe for this last year, but\r\n(_i.e._, except) for vli. he hath payde in parts thereof.”  “The Lord\r\nClinton oweth for 1000 kiddes.  Thomas Brownloe, servant of lord\r\nWilloughbie of Knaith, oweth for monev lent him, lvs.”—Prob. at Lincoln 9\r\nJan. 1608–9.\r\n\r\nOn these various items we may remark that, from the figures here given,\r\n60 sheep cost 27 pounds, or 9 shillings each, of the money of that date,\r\nand for the “sommering” of them was paid 8d. each.  In the first case his\r\nfather-in-law was only able to pay 5s. 4d. each, because the testator\r\nstill owed him for 40 of them.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Clinton named as owing for “1000 kiddes” would at that time be\r\nresiding at Tattershall Castle, which was one of his principal\r\nresidences, Sempringham being another (Camden’s “Britannia,” p. 478).  We\r\nhere have the thoroughly Lincolnshire word ”kid” for faggot. {133}  The\r\nname “Lope-thorpe” for the residence of the testator’s brother, Sir\r\nWilliam Sherard, is a variation from Lobthorpe.  A moat and fish ponds\r\nstill mark the site of Lobthorpe Hall in North Witham, and there are\r\nseveral monuments in the church of Sir Brownlow Sherard and other members\r\nof the family.  As there is no mention of the burial of this Edmund\r\nSherard, Gent., of Bracken-end, in the Woodhall parish register, he was\r\ndoubtless also interred at North Witham.\r\n\r\nThe “Sir John Meares of Aukborough” mentioned as a party to the\r\n“arbitrament” was a member of a very old Lincolnshire family, whose chief\r\nseat was Kirton near Boston, Sir John being lord of that manor; and there\r\nare several monuments of the family in the church there.  Sir Thomas\r\nMeares, of Meres, was M.P. for Lincoln in eleven Parliaments, and was\r\nknighted at Whitehall in 1660 by Charles II.; and another Thomas Meeres\r\nwas Member for the county in three Parlaiments temp. Henry VI.  The\r\n“Edward Skipwith, of Ketsby, Gent.,” also mentioned, is again a scion of\r\none of our very old county families, their chief seat in this\r\nneighbourhood having been South Ormsby, to which Ketsby is attached.  The\r\nchurch there has a brass of Sir William Skipwith, Knight, his wife (who\r\nwas a Dymoke) and children.  Among the “Lincolnshire Gentry” of 1634\r\nnamed in a list preserved in the library of the Herald’s College, are\r\nRobert Sherard of Gautby, and John Sherard; Robert Meeres of Kirton, and\r\nAnthony Meeres of Bonby; Edward Skipwith of Legbourne, Edward Skipwith of\r\nGrantham, and Samuel Skipwith of Utterby.\r\n\r\nIn the person, then, of this former squire of Bracken-end in Woodhall, we\r\nhave an individual belonging to a family of knightly rank, his friends\r\nbeing members of some of our oldest county aristocracy, and his\r\ntransactions connected with such Lords paramount as the Baron Willoughby\r\nof Knaith and Lord Clinton of Tattershall.  I may add that the family is\r\nnow represented by Lord Sherard of Leitrim, in the Peerage of Ireland,\r\nwho is connected by marriage with the Reeves of Leadenham, the\r\nWhichcotes, and other good Lincolnshire families.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to mention a few more of the ancient moated mansions in our\r\nneighbourhood.  It was mentioned in the last chapter that, besides two\r\nportions of the land of the parish of Woodhall being given by Baron\r\nBrito, son of Eudo of Tattershall, to the Abbey of Kirkstead, the rectory\r\nof that benefice was also in the gift of the Abbot.  In like manner the\r\nAbbot held lands in Thimbleby, erected a gallows there on which, at\r\ndifferent times, several persons were hanged; and he owned the advowson\r\nof that benefice; and the present rectory house of that parish, built\r\nabout 1840, stands on the site of a former residence, which was guarded\r\nby a moat.  Within this enclosure there is still an ancient well, lined\r\nwith Spilsby sandstone, of which the church, like most in the\r\nneighbourhood, is also built.  This well has been said to be “Roman,”\r\n{134} but, without venturing to give it so early a date, we may, perhaps,\r\nsafely say that it belonged to the lesser religious house formerly there\r\nexisting, as a dependency of the Abbey of Kirkstead.  There was, however,\r\na Roman well found a few years ago, at Horncastle, within the old Roman\r\ncastle walls, at the spot where the National Schools now stand.\r\nSimilarly, the Abbot of Kirkstead was patron of the benefice of\r\nWispington, another neighbouring parish, by the gift (about 1400) of\r\nanother and later descendant of Eudo of Tattershall, who owned a moiety\r\nof this parish, the Bishop of Durham holding the other moiety; and,\r\naccordingly, here again there are extensive moats, ponds, and mounds,\r\nindicating a former large, and strongly protected, residence.  Portions\r\nof this still form parts of a farmhouse (Mr. Evison’s), and the farm\r\nbuildings on the same premises, as well as of those now occupied by Mr.\r\nGaunt, whose very name carries us back to the days of the great Norman\r\nmagnate, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, scarcely less powerful than\r\nhis ancestor, Gilbert de Gaunt, to whom the Conqueror gave no less than\r\n113 manors; but to John belonged the peculiar distinction of being father\r\nof Henry IV., the only sovereign born in our county.  This mansion was\r\nfor some generations the property of a family of substance, named\r\nPhillips.  The head of this family, in the reign of Elizabeth, is\r\nmentioned among those patriotic individuals who subscribed his £25\r\ntowards the cost of the Fleet which was intended to repel the Spanish\r\nArmada.  One of this family, Phillips Glover, who was sheriff for the\r\ncounty in 1727, had a daughter Laura, who married Mr. Robert Vyner, of\r\nEathorpe, Warwickshire, whose family are now amongst our greatest\r\nlandowners, and draw an almost princely revenue from the Liverpool docks.\r\n\r\nWe now pass on to another neighbouring moated mansion.  About 2½ miles\r\nfrom Woodhall Spa to the east, and only separated from Woodhall parish by\r\na green lane, is White-Hall wood; on the opposite, northern, side of this\r\nlane being the High-Hall wood, already mentioned.  Both these woods take\r\ntheir names from the old residences contiguous to them.  The visitor to\r\nWoodhall Spa, if a pedestrian, leaving the road from Woodhall Spa to\r\nHorncastle, in that part of it called “Short lane,” because it is so\r\nlong; after passing the two small woods, called Roughton Scrubs, on his\r\nright hand, and just before reaching the slight ascent near Martin\r\nbridge, may take to a cart-track, on the left or north side of the road,\r\nthrough a wood, crossing the railway, which here runs almost close to the\r\nroad; pursuing this track through the wood some 200 yards, and then,\r\nturning slightly to the left in a north-westerly direction through two\r\nsmall grass fields, he will find, in an angle on the north side of the\r\nwood, a moated enclosure, between 75 and 80 yards square, shewing slight\r\nirregularities of the ground, on its northern side, indicating the site\r\nof a former building.  Outside the moat are traces of another enclosure;\r\na large depression shews where there was probably a “stew pond” for carp\r\nand tench; and the channel of a dyke is seen running north-west till it\r\njoins a small ditch, which may probably, at one time, have been a feeder\r\nto one of two streams already mentioned as being near the High Hall\r\nremains, and named “Odd’s beck.”  I may say here, once for all, that the\r\nmoats and ponds of these large establishments were a matter of\r\nconsiderable importance and care.  They were protected from injury by the\r\nActs, 3 Ed. I. and 5 Eliz., c. 21 (Treatise on Old Game Laws, 1725).\r\n“The fish-stews were scientifically cultivated, and so arranged that they\r\ncould be drained at will.  When the water was run off from one, the fish\r\nwere transferred to the next.  Oats, barley, and rye grass were then\r\ngrown in it; when these were reaped it was re-stocked with fish.  The\r\nponds were thus sweetened and a supply of food introduced; suitable weeds\r\nwere also grown on the margin, and each pond, or moat, was treated in the\r\nsame way in rotation.”—“Nature and Woodcraft,” by J. Watson.\r\n\r\nNothing now exists of this former mansion above ground, but the moats and\r\nmounds cover an area of more than two acres, shewing that it was a large\r\nresidence.  It is in Martin parish.  Within the writer’s recollection\r\nthere were marigolds and other flowers still growing about the spot,\r\nsurvivals from the quondam hall garth, or garden.  This was the home of a\r\nbranch of the Fynes, or Fiennes Clinton, family, whose head, Edward, Lord\r\nClinton and Saye, Lord High Admiral of England, was created Earl of\r\nLincoln by Queen Elizabeth in 1572; the present head of the family being\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle, whose creation dates from 1756.\r\n\r\nThe connection of this great family with our neighbourhood came about in\r\nthis wise.  The line of Lord Treasurer Cromwell having become extinct,\r\nHenry VII., in 1487, granted the manor and other estates to his mother,\r\nMargaret, Countess of Richmond, and in the following year entailed them\r\non the Duke of Richmond.  The Duke died without issue; and Henry VIII.,\r\nin 1520, granted them to Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk.  On the death\r\nof the two infant sons of the Duke, surviving their father only a short\r\ntime, the estates again reverted to the Sovereign; and in 1551 Edwd. VI.\r\ngranted them to Edward Lord Clinton and Saye, afterwards, as we have\r\nsaid, Earl of Lincoln.  These estates included that of the dissolved\r\nAbbey of Kirkstead, and other properties in this neighbourhood; and among\r\nthem the White Hall and its appurtenances.  When the earldom of Lincoln,\r\nthrough a marriage, became absorbed in the Dukedom of Newcastle, several\r\nof these estates remained with junior branches of the Clinton, or\r\nFiennes, family.  Of the particular branch residing at White Hall,\r\nprobably the most distinguished member was one whose monumental tablet is\r\nstill in Roughton church; the ministrations of which church they would\r\nseem, judging by entries in the registers, to have attended, in\r\npreference to the church of Martin, in which parish the estate was\r\nsituated.  The lengthy inscription on this tablet is as follows:—“Here\r\nlies the body of Norreys Fynes, Esq., Grandson to Sir Henry Clinton,\r\ncommonly called Fynes, eldest son of Henry Earl of Lincoln, by his Second\r\nWife, Daughter of Sir Richard Morrison, and Mother of Francis Lord\r\nNorreys, afterwards Earl of Berkshire.  He had by his much-beloved and\r\nonly Wife Elizabeth, who lies by him, Twelve children, of which Four Sons\r\nand Two Daughters were living at his decease, which happened on the 10th\r\nof January 1735–6 in the 75th year of his age.  From the Revolution he\r\nalways liv’d a Non-juror, {137} which rendered him incapable of any other\r\nPublick Employment (tho’ by his Great Ability and Known Courage equal to\r\nthe most Difficult and Dangerous) than that of being Steward to two great\r\nFamilys, wherein he distinguish’d himself during his service of 40 year a\r\nmost Faithful and Prudent manager, of a most Virtuous and Religious Life.\r\nHis paternal estate he left without any addition to his son Kendal his\r\nnext heir.  His eldest son Charles was buried here the 26th August 1722,\r\naged 36 years, whose Pleasant Disposition adorn’d by many virtues which\r\nhe acquired by his Studys in Oxford made his death much lamented by all\r\nhis Acquaintance.”  Possibly, as being a Non-juror, he may have thought\r\nit best not to attend public worship in his own parish church at Martin,\r\nand so have gone, with his family, to the church of Roughton, where, as\r\nan “outener,” he would be asked no questions.  I find in connection with\r\nhis family the following notices in the Roughton Registers, the spelling\r\nof which would certainly shew that the writer was not a\r\n“Beauclerk”:—“1722 Mr. Charles fines burried Augst ye 26. 1722”; “Madame\r\nElizabeth fines was buered May ye 29, 1730”  This was the “only and much\r\nloved wife” of Norreys Fynes, and the title “Madame” was a recognition of\r\nher superior rank.  “Norreys Fynes Esq. was buried ye 10th January\r\n1736/7”  This entry was evidently so correctly made by the Rector\r\nhimself; as also was probably the next one, “Dormer Fynes ye sonn of\r\nKendall Fynes Esq. and Frances his wife was baptized Nov. 10. 1737.”\r\n“Cendal (Kendal) fins, the son of Norreys fins was buried June the twenty\r\nfoorst, 1740.”  (Note the Lincolnshire pronunciation “foorst”).  “Francis\r\nFynes, widow of Kendall Fynes buried May 13. 1752.”\r\n\r\nI mentioned in a previous chapter the very bad condition of the roads\r\nabout here; and there is a still lingering tradition that the last of the\r\nFynes residing at White Hall used to drive about in a waggon drawn by\r\nbullocks.  This estate, with some other land, of which the writer has\r\nbeen “shooting tenant” for more than a score of years, is still in the\r\nhands of “the Fiennes Clinton Trustees”; but there are Fynes, still in\r\nthe flesh, living in our midst at Woodhall, who, though treading a\r\nhumbler walk in life, are not altogether unworthy of their high ancestry.\r\n{138}\r\n\r\nThere is another old moated residence, of considerable historic interest,\r\nwhich next claims our attention.  Within a mile westward of the Wood\r\nHall, by the church, and closely contiguous to the north-west boundary of\r\nthe Woodhall estate, stands Poolham Hall, an old-fashioned, but\r\ncomfortable and substantially-built, stucco-coated and slated farmhouse.\r\nIt now, along with the small manor, belongs to Dr. Byron, residing in\r\nLondon, who bought it a few years ago from Mr. Christopher Turnor, of\r\nStoke Rochford and Panton Hall, in this county.  At the back of the Hall,\r\nat the south-west corner of what is now the kitchen garden, and close to\r\nthe enclosing moat, are the remains of a small chapel, consisting of an\r\nend wall and part of a side wall, each with a narrow window; there are\r\nfragments of larger stones bearing traces of sculpture, and, within\r\nrecollection, there was also a tombstone with the date 1527, and a font.\r\n{139}  The house was, doubtless, formerly much larger than it is now.\r\nLike the other similar residences which I have described, Poolham Hall\r\nhas close by it a running stream, called Monk’s dyke, which unites with\r\nsome of the other becks already named, and ultimately flows into the\r\nWitham.  The chief interest in this old place lies in the distant past;\r\nit has gone through a varied series of vicissitudes, and witnessed some\r\nstirring scenes.  Weir, in his “History of Horncastle” (ed. 1820, p. 58),\r\nunder the head of Edlington, says briefly of Poolham, “anciently called\r\nPolum, it formed part of the Barony of Gilbert de Gaunt, until about the\r\n35th year of Edward I., when Robert de Barkeworth died seised of it; and\r\nit appears to have been the residence of Walter de Barkeworth, who died\r\nin 1374, and was buried in the cloister of Lincoln Cathedral.  Afterwards\r\nit was the residence of the family of Thimbleby, a branch of the\r\nThimblebys of Irnham, who probably built the present house about the time\r\nof Henry VIII.  In the reign of Elizabeth the Saviles of Howley possessed\r\nit; and in 1600 Sir John Savile, Knight, sold it to George Bolles,\r\ncitizen of London, whose descendant, Sir John Bolles, Baronet, conveyed\r\nit to Sir Edmund Turnor, Knight, of Stoke Rochford.”  Of the above\r\nfamilies, I have not been able to find very much about the Barkworths,\r\nwho took their name doubtless from East Barkwith, where they had\r\nproperty.  But Gocelyn de Barkworth, and after him William de Barkworth,\r\nare named in an Assize Roll (4 Ed. II., 1311) as having possessions in\r\nTetford.  In 3 Ed. III. (A.D. 1329), William de Barkworth and his wife\r\n“fflorianora” were plaintiffs in a land dispute with Robert de Hanay and\r\nAlice his wife; whereby “1 messuage, 1 carucate of land, 9 acres of\r\nmeadow, 1 acre of ‘more,’ and the moiety of 1 messuage and 1 mill, with\r\nappurtenances in Normanby, Claxby, and Ussylby, were quitclaimed to\r\nWilliam and fflorianora, and fflorianora’s heirs.”  I may add, as to the\r\nitem here named “1 mill,” that a mill in those days was a property of\r\nsome value; all the dependents of the lord of the manor were obliged to\r\nhave their corn, for man or beast, ground in it; and no other mill was\r\nallowed in the neighbourhood where one was already established.  It is\r\nrecorded by Beckman that “a certain Abbot wished to erect a mill, which\r\nwas objected to by a neighbouring proprietor, who contended that the wind\r\nof the whole district belonged to him.  The monks complained to the\r\nbishop, who gave them permission to build, affirming that the wind of the\r\nwhole diocese was episcopal property.”  (Oliver’s “Rel., Houses,” p. 76\r\nnote 9.)  In 1351 William de Barkworth, “lord of Polume,” presented to\r\nthe moiety of the chapelry (of Poolham); and in 1369 Thomas de Thymelby\r\npresented to it.  And from this time the Thimblebyes take the place of\r\nthe Barkworths.  These Thimblebyes, whose name is variously spelt\r\nThimelby, Thymbylbye, and even (as in Domesday Book) Stimblebi, and\r\nStinblebi, were a numerous and influential race.  Their chief residence\r\nwas Irnham Park, near Grantham, which was acquired about 1510 by Richard\r\nThimbleby, on his marriage with the heiress of Godfrey Hilton, whose\r\nancestor, Sir Geoffrey Hilton, Knight, had obtained it in 1419, by his\r\nmarriage with an heiress of the Luterels, several of whom were called to\r\nParliament, as Barons, in the 13th century.  This was one of fifteen\r\nmanors given by William the Conqueror to Ralph Paganel; and with the\r\nheiress of his family it passed, by marriage, to Sir Andrew Luterel,\r\nKnight.  The Thymblebyes would seem to have taken their patronymic from\r\nthe village of that name (part of which now forms a portion of the\r\nWoodhall Spa parish), as the earlier members of the family we find\r\ndesignated as Thomas de Thymelby.  Nicholas de Thymelby, and so forth.\r\nBesides land in Thimbleby they owned many other estates.  For instance,\r\nin the Court of Wards Inquisitions (3, 4, and 5 Edward VI., vol. v., 91),\r\nwe find that Matthew Thimbleby “of Polom,” who married Anne, daughter of\r\nSir Robert Hussey, about 1521, died “seised of the manors of Polome,\r\nFarfford, Ruckelyond, Somersby, Parish-fee, in Horncastle, Edlynton,\r\nThymylby, and Tydd St. Mary; also of lands in Horsyngton, Styxwolde,\r\nBlankney, Buckland (_i.e._ Woodhall), and Flette: and of the advowsons of\r\nTetforde, Farefford, Rucklonde, and Somersbye.”  This Matthew Thimbleby’s\r\nwealthy “grass widow” married again, Sir Robert Savile, Knight, who\r\n(according to Chancery Inquisition, post mortem, 28 Eliz., 1st part, No.\r\n116) “died seised of the manors of Poolham, Horsington, Stixwolde,\r\nEdlington, Tetford, Farforth, Somersby, and Ruckland.”\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the Thimblebyes, we have one more incident to name in\r\nconnection with them.  In 1581, one of them, residing at Poolham, was\r\nimprisoned in Lincoln Castle for refusing to attend the new Reformed\r\nServices and Communion.  His wife greatly desired to see him, and was\r\nallowed her request by Thomas Cooper, Bishop of Lincoln.  She was near\r\nher confinement, but, as her name was among a list of those not\r\nfavourable to the Reformation, she was treated rather roughly, and\r\ndetained by force in her husband’s cell.  This brought on premature\r\nlabour, and in the hour of her weakness she was denied the assistance of\r\na matron.  It is said that a speedy death ended her sufferings; her\r\nhusband also dying in prison.—“The Church under Elizabeth,” by Dr. F. G.\r\nLee, vol. ii., p. 60.  It is further recorded of this same Bishop, that\r\nhe summoned Sir Robert Dymoke to Lincoln for examination as to his\r\nsupposed Papist tendencies, and on Sir Robert excusing himself on the\r\nscore of ill health, the Bishop came in person to Scrivelsby and carried\r\nhim forcibly to Lincoln, and cast him into prison, where he presently\r\ndied.  It is not a little curious that one, who, as a doughty knight, at\r\nthree coronations threw down his gauntlet and challenged the world on his\r\nSovereign’s behalf, should have succumbed to a stiff-necked prelate.  The\r\naccount of this is given in Lodge’s “Scrivelsby, the Home of the\r\nChampions,” pp. 77, 78.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the Saviles.  They were a wealthy and distinguished\r\nYorkshire family, now represented by the Earls of Mexborough.  Sir Robert\r\ndisposed of some of the property in this neighbourhood, which he had\r\nacquired by his marriage with the widow Thimbleby, but he retained\r\nPoolham, and made the Hall his headquarters. {142a}  The Saviles may have\r\nbeen hot-blooded, for they had not been located long at Poolham before\r\nthey became embroiled with their neighbours.  The manners of the times\r\nwere somewhat rough, and we here give a sample or two.  The autocrat of\r\nthe neighbourhood at that time was Henry Fiennes Clinton, second Earl of\r\nLincoln, who was apparently inclined to ride roughshod over everyone who\r\ncame in his way; the object of his life seems to have been to quarrel,\r\nand to keep in a state of irritation the county from which he derived his\r\ntitle.  It is said that Denzil Hollis, “living much at Irby, used to\r\nconfront the Earl of Lincoln, who was a great tyrant among the gentry of\r\nLincolnshire, and to carry business against him, in spite of his teeth.”\r\n{142b}  But stout old Denzil died in 1590, and, this check withdrawn, the\r\nEarl’s conduct increased in violence. {142c}  Lodge, {142d} in his\r\nrecords, mentions one Roger Fullshaw of Waddingworth (near Horncastle),\r\nwho, in 1596, prayed for protection against the most horrible outrages\r\ncommitted by the Earl, and says that his conduct savoured of insanity.\r\nBefore he succeeded to the earldom, and consequently when he had not yet\r\nso much power to oppress, he committed the following aggressions on the\r\nSaviles of Poolham.  We must premise that Sir Robert Savile, though a\r\nknight of good estate, and though his descendants became Earls of Sussex,\r\nwas, nevertheless, a natural son of Sir Henry Savile, by Margaret\r\nBarkston, “his Ladie’s gentlewoman,” {143a} which, as will be seen, was\r\nnot forgotten by the high-born Clinton.  These occurrences took place in\r\n1578.  They were neighbours, and jealous of trespass; and, on the 13th of\r\nJune, Lord Clinton, “with 7 men with cross-bowes and long-bowes bent,”\r\nforced himself into the parlour at Poolham Hall, and, after threatening\r\nwords, struck Sheffield Savile, the son, on the head.  The elder Savile\r\nsays that he prevented his son from noticing the outrage, an unusual\r\ndegree of forbearance under the circumstances; but there had evidently\r\nbeen some previous misunderstanding, and possibly young Savile had been\r\nin the wrong.  On the 25th of June following, Lord Clinton, hearing Sir\r\nRobert’s hounds hunting in Mr. Welby’s wood, {143b} although it was no\r\nconcern of his, seized five of them, and then sent a letter to Sir\r\nRobert, threatening that he would hang them before his house; and, in\r\nfact, did hang them, as Sir Robert says, “upon my own tree within my own\r\nground.”\r\n\r\nAnother violent proceeding is described in a letter of the Earl’s friend.\r\nMr. Metham {143c} had been previously entertaining Lord Clinton at\r\nMetham, and was now on a return visit to Tattershall; and, as he relates,\r\n“It pleased him (Lord Clinton) to carrye me with my companye through his\r\npark (still surviving in the name “Tattershall park”) unto the chase,\r\nwhere his meaning was to have made sport with hounds and greyhounds\r\n(i.e., badger hounds), and leading me by, into the meadows, he shewed me\r\ncertain of the great deer of the chase, such as he kept rather for show\r\nthan to be hunted.”  These would be the red deer (cervus elaphus) still\r\nexisting then on Hatfield chase, in the northwest of the county, in\r\nconsiderable numbers.  The deer broke away into Mr. Welby’s woods, and\r\n“thence, as my lord affirmed, with an oath, into the mouths of the\r\nSaviles.”  Lord Clinton’s attendants followed the hounds, Lord Clinton\r\nhimself not doing so; but, in passing along a lane, he encountered some\r\nof the Savile followers, “in number 20 or 24, the more part having\r\nswords, bucklers, and daggers, some pyked staves, one a cross-bowe with\r\nan arrowe, another a long bowe and arrows.”  While words were being\r\nexchanged “ould Mr. Savile” came up, and the following characteristic\r\ndialogue ensued.  “My Lord Clinton, yf thou be a man, light, and fight\r\nwith me.”  “With thee, bastardlye knave,” quoth my lord, “I will deal\r\nwith thee well enough, and teach thee, knave, thy duty.”  Upon which\r\nwords Mr. Savile called my lord “a cowardly knave.”  Challenges passed\r\nbetween them, and with Sheffield Savile, who, withdrawing, as he says,\r\nLord Clinton by the arm, called out after him, “You a lord, you are a\r\nkitchen boy.”  Sir Robert, after their departure, having got hold of one\r\nof Lord Clinton’s dogs, meant, Metham says, “to use it with like courtesy\r\nas my lord has done his.”  Lord Clinton then approached Poolham Hall, and\r\na challenge passed, through John Savile, to fight six to six, “which by\r\ngood entreaty was stayed.”  Savile says, {144} in his narrative, that the\r\nfollowers of Lord Clinton were entertained at Horncastle, the same day,\r\nwith a buck; and getting hold of an unfortunate tailor, some ten or\r\ntwelve of them drew their swords and sore wounded him, saying he should\r\n“have that, and more, for his master’s sake, Mr. Sheffield Savile.”\r\n\r\nThe Lansdown MSS. give details of other violent proceedings of Lord\r\nClinton towards the Saviles; how he over-ran the lands of Poolham with 60\r\nmen, armed with guns, cross-bows, and long bows; how he ill-treated their\r\nservants sent to Tattershall on domestic errands; incited the neighbours\r\nto send challenges to them; how he tried to entice into his park the\r\nyounger Saviles, and laid ambushes for them; and various other\r\nproceedings which he would not for a moment have tolerated in anyone\r\nelse.  It redounds, indeed, to the credit of the Saviles that Poolham was\r\nnot made the scene of retaliation and bloodshed. {145}\r\n\r\nIn 1600 Sir John Savile sold Poolham to George Bolles, Esq.  Of the\r\nBolles family I have been able to find but scanty mention.  Among\r\nLincolnshire Gentry who supplied demy-lances and light horse, at the\r\nLouth Sessions, March, 1586–7, Charles Bolles is named as “Captaine,”\r\nfurnishing “ij. horse”; and Richard Bolles “ij launces” and “ij horse”;\r\nwhile Richard Bowles, which is probably the same name, is mentioned along\r\nwith Sir Willm. Skipwith, Mr. Willm. Fitzwilliam, and Mr. Andrewe Gedney,\r\nSir William’s son-in-law, as the officials who presided at the “Spittle\r\nSessions,” _i.e._, at Spittal in the Street, near Kirton in Lindsey.\r\n\r\nThe last of this family to occupy Poolham was Sir John Bolles, Bart., who\r\nconveyed it to Sir Edmund Turnor of Stoke Rochford.  Sir John Bolles is\r\nconnected with the pretty and interesting legend and ballad of “The Green\r\nLady of Thorpe Hall,” which was his chief residence.  The ballad is among\r\nPercy’s “Reliques,” and records how, while serving in Spain, the knight\r\nmade captive a noble Spanish lady, who fell in love with her captor; but\r\nhe had to check and chill her advances, in this language:—\r\n\r\n    “Courteous ladye, leave this fancy,\r\n       Here comes all that breeds the strife;\r\n    I in England have already\r\n       A sweet woman to my wife.”\r\n\r\nTo which, after craving pardon for her offence, she replies,\r\n\r\n       “Commend me to thy lovely lady,\r\n          Bear to her this chain of gold;\r\n       And these bracelets for a token:\r\n          Grieving that I was so bold.\r\n    All my jewels, in like sort, take thou with thee,\r\n    They are fitting for thy wife but not for me.”\r\n\r\nThe tradition, confirmed in recent years in correspondence by connections\r\nof the family (see notes to ballad, “The Spanish Lady’s Love,” vol. ii.,\r\np. 144, ed. 1848) affirms that, on Sir John leaving Spain for home, the\r\nlady “sent as presents to his wife, a profusion of jewellery and other\r\nvaluables,” with a portrait of herself dressed in green.  Hence she was\r\nnamed “the Green Lady.”  It was said that she haunted Thorpe Hall, that\r\nher apparition was occasionally seen, and that it was long the custom to\r\nhave a plate laid for her at this table at mealtime.  That this story\r\ndoes not belong entirely to the region of fiction is proved by the fact,\r\nknown to the writer, and, doubtless, to many others, that a lady in this\r\nneighbourhood possesses, and at times wears on her person, one article\r\nfrom the “Green Lady’s” gift of jewellery.\r\n\r\nWe have one more moated mansion in our neighbourhood which should here be\r\nmentioned, viz., Halstead, or Hawstead, Hall, in the adjoining parish of\r\nStixwould.  This is the one instance, out of the several old residences I\r\nhave mentioned, in which there still remains a substantial building\r\nabove-ground.  Doubtless the Hall, originally, was considerably larger\r\nthan it is at present, since, at different periods, it has been occupied\r\nby members of leading county families; and I find, from a note, that the\r\nfirst Earl of Shaftesbury, who married a sister of Lord Coventry, at one\r\ntime owner of Stixwould, used to visit here, and accommodation was found\r\nfor himself and a large retinue.  Foundations of further buildings have\r\nbeen found at odd times.  The present Hall is a two-storied structure;\r\nthe rooms not large, but lofty, their height on the ground floor being\r\nover 10ft., and on the upper floor more than 13ft.; with spacious attics\r\nabove for stores.  The walls are very substantial, being 2½ft. thick;\r\nwhile the windows, with their massive Ancaster mullions, would further\r\nindicate a much larger building.  Outside the now dry bed of the moat\r\nstands a lofty building, at present used as stables and barn, which has\r\nstoneframed windows, the walls being of brick, smaller than the\r\npresent-day bricks, and resembling those of Tattershall Castle and the\r\nTower on the Moor, and, doubtless, made close at hand, where there is\r\nstill a brickyard.  The walls are relieved by diamond-shaped patterns, of\r\nblack brick, those in the upper part being smaller than those below.\r\n{146}  A very fine mantelpiece, formerly in Halstead Hall, is now at\r\nDenton House, near Grantham, the seat of Sir William Earle Welby Gregory,\r\nBart., who is the present head of the family.  It is after the fashion of\r\nthe famous mantelpieces of Tattershall Castle.  In recent times Halstead\r\nHall has been chiefly known for the great robbery which occurred there on\r\nFeb. 2nd, 1829, and which has been related in Chapter II. of this volume.\r\nBut, though no connected account of its early owners or occupants can be\r\ngiven, some interesting details have been brought together by the Rev. J.\r\nA. Penny, Vicar of Wispington, and formerly of Stixwould, which are\r\ngiven, with a sketch of the Hall, in “Lincolnshire Notes & Queries” (vol.\r\niii., pp. 33–37).  The estate was the property of Richard Welby of\r\nMoulton, being named in his will, 1465.  He left it to a son “Morys,”\r\nfrom whom it passed to a brother Roger, and from one of his sons came the\r\nWelbys of Halstead.  The will of one of them is preserved among the\r\n“Lincoln Wills (1st series) proved 18 August, 1524,” wherein he desired\r\n“to be buried in the Church of Stixwolde before the image of our Lady.”\r\n\r\nIn 1561, March 21, the representative of the Halstead branch of this one\r\nof our leading county families was granted the crest of “an armed arm,\r\nthe hand charnell (_i.e._, flesh-coloured) yssvinge out of a cloud,\r\nazure, in a flame of fire”; and the arms are sable, a fess, between three\r\nfleur-de-lis, argent, with six quarterings.  He, Richard Welby, was in\r\nthat year Sheriff for the county.\r\n\r\nIn 1588, Vincent Welby is named in the list of gentry who subscribed £25\r\neach to the loan for repelling the expected Spanish Armada, and at the\r\nmuster at Horncastle, in 1586–7, he furnished “ij horse,” as also did his\r\nrelative Mr. Welby of Gouphill (Goxhill) at “Castor.”  The first entry of\r\nthe Welbys in the Stixwould Registers was “Ann Welbie, christened May\r\n28,” 1547; the last was in 1598.  After them Halstead Hall was owned by a\r\nfamily of the name of Evington, one of whom, Richard, left “iiijli xs to\r\nbe paid yearlie, at the discretion of my executors, to the poor of\r\nStixwolde, on the 25 March and 29 Sept.”  After them it was occupied by\r\nthe Townshends.  Of this family there are two notices in the parish\r\nregister:—“Mr. George Townshend Esqr died att Halstead and was buryed att\r\nWaddingworth on Wensdaie night the 13th of Februarie 1627.”  The other\r\nis, “Mr. Kirkland Snawden and Mrs. Francis Townshend married the 25th of\r\nDecember, being Christmas daie 1628.”  Notice the Lincolnshire\r\npronunciation Snawden for Snowden.  No reason is given for the unusual\r\nburial by night; and special attention is drawn to the marriage of the\r\nwidow, by the sketch in the margin of a hand with outstretched fingers.\r\nThis Kirkland Snowden was a grandson of a Bishop of Carlisle, his father\r\nbeing the Bishop’s son, and Vicar of Horncastle.  They had a daughter\r\nAbigail, who married a Dymoke, from whom the present Dymokes are\r\ndescended.  This is one of two instances of a daughter of a Vicar of\r\nHorncastle marrying a Dymoke, since in the present century Miss Madeley,\r\nthe only daughter of Dr. Clement Madeley, Vicar, married the late\r\nchampion, Rev. John Dymoke.  After these it was held by the Gibbons, of\r\nwhich family there are also a few entries in the registers.  Another\r\nowner was Sir John Coventry, who was assaulted for using offensive\r\nlanguage about King Charles II., asking in Parliament “whether the king’s\r\npleasure lay in the men or women players” at the theatres.  He wounded\r\nseveral of his assailants, but had his own nose cut to the bone; in\r\nconsequence of which “The Coventry Act” was passed in 1671, making it\r\nfelony to maim or disfigure a person, and refusing to allow the king to\r\npardon the offenders.  A later owner was Sir William Kite, Bart., who ran\r\nthrough a large fortune, and sold Halstead and Stixwould to Lord Anson,\r\nthe distinguished navigator, and Lord High Admiral of England; some of\r\nwhose exploits are recorded in “Anson’s Voyage Round the World,” by\r\nBenjamin Robins.  In 1778 the property was sold to Edmund Turnor, Esq.,\r\nand is still held by his descendants.  This old house is well worth a\r\nvisit; and visitors are courteously received by the family who now reside\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nI now propose to invite the visitor to Woodhall Spa to accompany me in\r\nthought (as not a few have done in person) to some of the places of\r\ninterest, churches, or ruins, in the neighbourhood, as it may add a zest\r\nto his perambulations to know something about them.  The descriptions\r\nwill probably be brief, leaving a margin to be filled in by his own\r\npersonal observation, thus affording him a motive for further enquiry,\r\nand an aim and object for the rambles, which may conduce to his health in\r\nthe expansion alike of mind and of lung.  Woodhall does not lie within\r\nwhat may be called the architectural zone of Lincolnshire.  In the south,\r\nsouth-east, and south-west of the county, parish after parish possesses a\r\nlarge church, often beyond the requirements of the population, and of\r\ngreat and varied architectural beauty.  There is probably no district in\r\nEngland so rich in fine edifices.  Much of the land was at one time held\r\nby powerful Norman knights and barons, whose energies were often spent in\r\ninternecine feuds.  The mediæval creed impressed them with the belief\r\nthat their deeds of violence could be atoned for by the erection of\r\ncostly churches for the worship, by others, of that God whom they\r\nthemselves little honoured.  Interested ecclesiastics fostered this\r\nfeeling, {149a} which also fell in with the “Ora pro nobis” yearning of\r\ntheir own breasts, when suffering from what an old writer has called “the\r\nayen-bite of Inwyt,” {149b} or, in modern parlance, “remorse of\r\nconscience.”  But if, judged by the scale of expiation, made in endowment\r\nand embodied in stone, these high-handed lords would seem to have been\r\nsinners above their more ordinary fellows, we must at least gratefully\r\nallow that they have left to us of the present day a goodly heritage,\r\nwhich even our modern vastly increased wealth has not enabled us to\r\nemulate.  These fine churches, in our neighbourhood may be said to\r\nterminate at Coningsby and Tattershall.\r\n\r\nIn the villages immediately near us, and for several miles northward and\r\neastward, the churches are small; yet several of them have features of\r\nconsiderable interest.  Let us turn our steps northward.  The road takes\r\nus in sight of a column, or obelisk, surmounted by a bust of the first\r\nDuke of Wellington.  The history of this is told by the inscription on\r\nthe pedestal: “Waterloo Wood was raised from acorns sown immediately\r\nafter the memorable battle of Waterloo, when victory was achieved by the\r\ngreat Captain of the age, his Grace the Duke of Wellington, commanding\r\nthe British forces, against the French armies commanded by Napoleon\r\nBonaparte, the 18th June, 1815, which momentous victory gave general\r\npeace to Europe.  This monument was erected by R. E. (Richard Elmhirst)\r\n1844.”  The bust faces to the north-east, in the direction of West Ashby,\r\nwhere Colonel Elmhirst resided.  The property some years ago passed, by\r\nsale, into other hands.  At about three miles distance from Woodhall we\r\nreach the small but well-built village of Stixwould (in Domesday Book,\r\nStigesuuald, Stigeswalt, Stigeswalde).  As to the name Stixwould, anyone,\r\nwithout being a wag, might well say, and with some apparent reason, “What\r\nmore natural combination than these two syllables?”  We naturally, in\r\nprimitive life, go to the “wald,” or wood, for our sticks.  Was not the\r\nliberty to gather “kindling,” as we now call it, a valued privilege, even\r\nlike the parallel right of “turbage”—to cut peat—for the domestic hearth?\r\nThe “sticks-wood” would be the resort of many a serf and villain, for\r\npurposes lawful, or the reverse.  But, unfortunately, the most apparently\r\nobvious explanation is not necessarily the correct one.  Whether the\r\nfirst part of this name has a reference to a staked-out ford on the\r\nWitham, corresponding to the “wath,” or ford, at Kirkstead, or whether it\r\nis from the old Norse “stigt,” a path, as some suggest, is uncertain.\r\nStreatfeild says, “The swampy locality would favour the idea of ‘stakes’”\r\n(“Lincolnshire and the Danes,” pp. 147–8).  I may here notice that the\r\nold name of Dublin (Dubh-lynn, _i.e._ the black water) was Athcleath, or\r\n“the ford of the hurdles,” which seems a parallel instance (“The Vikings\r\nof Western Christendom,” by C. F. Keary, p. 83, n. 3).  The latter half\r\nof the name would seem to refer to the woods of the district; and\r\nvisitors may see a very fine specimen of an ancient oak in the garden of\r\nthe Abbey Farm at the farther end of the village; also a fine one at\r\nHalstead Hall, to the east of the village; and there are several more in\r\nthe fields, relics, doubtless, of ancient woods.  The church was rebuilt\r\nin 1831, not a favourable period in church restoration, but on the whole\r\nMr. Padley, the architect, did his work fairly well, although some\r\nspoliation was perpetrated, stained glass being taken away from the\r\nwindows; and the panels of the pulpit in Lea church are said to have been\r\nalso taken from here.  Some notes, still preserved in vol. ii. (p. 87) of\r\nWillson’s Collection (architect and surveyor, of Lincoln) would seem to\r\nimply that the former church was finer than the present.  He says,\r\n“Stixwould church, spacious, and has been elegant, and is full of curious\r\nremnants; style Ed. IV. or Henry VII.; tower very handsome; . . .  The\r\ninterior has been very beautiful—lofty pointed arches, roof of nave and\r\nsouth aisle supported on rich carved figures of angels with shields;\r\nwindows full of remnants of beautiful glass; old oak desks and benches\r\ncarved . . . curious font . . . upper end of south aisle inclosed in two\r\nscreens of oak . . . exquisitely rich and elegant.  This is called the\r\nlittle choir, and belongs to Halstead Hall . . . both aisles have had\r\naltars.  Base and pillar of churchyard cross remain.”  He also mentions a\r\ncuriously-carved stone in the churchyard in front of the tower, “like a\r\nclock face,” with unusual inscription; which the present writer has also\r\nseen there; but it is now removed to Lincoln. {151a}\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. A. Penny, formerly Vicar of Stixwould, furnished the\r\nfollowing description of the present church, when the writer, as local\r\nhonorary secretary, conducted the “Lincoln and Notts. Architectural\r\nSociety” round the neighbourhood in 1894:—“The figures and pinnacles on\r\nthe tower are from the old tower; the choir screen was formed from that\r\nformerly round the small choir, but only one-third of the original,\r\n{151b} which was used as a pew by the tenants of Halstead Hall.  Under\r\nthe stone slab nearest the screen, in the nave, were deposited the\r\nremains of a Mr. Boulton, who stabbed his mother to death in the little\r\nchapel outside the Priory gate, for which he was hanged at Lincoln.  The\r\nstone face and wooden angels are from the former church, as also the\r\nbench ends on the south side.  The royal arms, with date 1662, are in a\r\nwall in the Abbey farmhouse; and the holy water stoup is under the pump\r\nin the school yard.  The fine slab, with cross, now under the tower, was\r\ndug up on the site of the Priory, also the stone coffin which stands\r\nthere; and the rest in the vicarage garden.  One of the bells is exactly\r\nthe same as that in the Guildhall at Lincoln, and dates from 1370; it is\r\ndedicated to St. Katine, with foundry mark (Nottingham), founder’s\r\ninitials, and merchant’s mark.  The font is octagonal, with evangelic\r\nemblems, and names, on four sides; on the other sides, a monk seated in a\r\nchair and holding Y in his arms; next a man with arms akimbo, facing due\r\neast; next a monk, or Friar; and next a figure in flab cap, with sword,\r\nholding a rose in his left hand, his right resting on his belt.  These\r\nfour figures come between the emblems of St. Mark and St. Luke.”\r\n\r\nOf the Religious House, or Priory, at Stixwould, the published accounts\r\nare not quite in accord.  Stukeley and Dugdale {152a} place it among the\r\nBenedictine establishments, whereas Leland calls it Cistercian; {152b}\r\nthis, however, is hardly a contradiction, since the Cistercians were “the\r\nstraitest sect” of the Benedictines. {152c}  It is said generally to have\r\nbeen founded by the Lady Lucia (“Comitissa Cestriæ et Lincoln”), widow of\r\nthe great Norman Baron, Ivo Taillebois, who came over with the Conqueror\r\nand to have been further endowed by her two sons, Ranulph, Earl of\r\nChester, and William de Romara, Earl of Lincoln. {152d}  We may just\r\nobserve here, in passing, that the figure cut into the stone which\r\nsupports the credence table, in the chancel of St. Andrew’s Church,\r\nWoodhall, is supposed to be that of this Countess Lucia, being brought\r\nfrom the ruins of Stixwould Priory.  The Rev. Thomas Cox, in his\r\n“Lincolnshire” (1719), however, says that the founder was Galfred de\r\nEzmondeys.  Doubtless, various persons, and at different periods, endowed\r\nor enlarged the foundation, and so became entitled to be counted among\r\nthe “fundatores.”  By an Inquisition, taken at Stamford, 3 Ed. I., it was\r\nfound that “the Master and Nuns” held divers lands at Huntington, of the\r\ngift of several benefactors, among them being Alexander Creviquer, Lucia,\r\nCountess of Chester, and her son Ranulph; and that “they had been so held\r\nfor the space of one hundred years.” {153a}  Ultimately it became a very\r\nwealthy institution, having, besides property in Lincoln, lands lying in\r\n13 Deaneries, and in the Soke of Grantham in more than a dozen parishes;\r\nwith the advowson of the Benefices of Stixwould and Wainfleet, a pension\r\nfrom Alford, and other property, one item being “two tofts in Horsington\r\nto provide lamps and tapers for the service of the altar.” {153b}  The\r\nrules of this establishment were very strict.  The lives of the nuns were\r\nto be devoted to prayer and works of charity.  Their leisure hours were\r\noccupied in reading, or relating legends of Saints, in working tapestry,\r\nembroidering altar and pulpit cloths, and such like. {153c}  The convent\r\nwas so entirely shut in by walls, according to the old regulation, “as\r\nscarcely to leave an entrance for birds.”  They were not allowed even to\r\nconverse with each other without license from the Prioress.  If strangers\r\nwished to communicate with them, it was only allowed through a grating,\r\nveiled, and in the presence of witnesses.  They confessed periodically to\r\nthe Incumbent of the parish, with a latticed window between them.  By one\r\nof their rules they were not to go alone even into the garden, except\r\nunder great necessity, and on festivals; and no flowers, except jessamine\r\nand violets, were to be plucked, without permission from the sacrist; and\r\nthey could only leave the convent on account of illness, to console the\r\nsick, or attend funerals, except by episcopal dispensation.\r\nNevertheless, although nominally living thus under severe restraint, it\r\nwould appear that certain relaxations were allowed.  They were at times\r\npermitted to exercise the accomplishments of music, and even dancing.\r\nThey had their processions and other monastic amusements, like the monks,\r\nand even patronized the feast of fools, and other absurdities of the\r\ntimes. {154a}  We may even picture to ourselves the Prioress indulging in\r\nthe sport of hunting, for she had charters of free warren over the Priory\r\nlands, {154b} and the Harleyan MSS., in the British Museum, have\r\nilluminated representations of buxom dames, riding with hounds, and\r\nshooting stags, and bears, with cross-bow; wearing sensible clothing and\r\nseated astride on their palfreys {154c}.  The State Records speak of\r\nthese devotional ladies as “the holy Nuns of Stixwold,” {154d} yet, at\r\none time, public complaint was made that the Prioress of Stixwould had no\r\nscruples in so encroaching upon the waters of the Witham and diverting\r\nits course, that the vessels accustomed to ply on it with turf and\r\nfaggots for the people of Lincoln, could now only do so at great peril.\r\n{154e}  We may, perhaps, however, exonerate the “Lady Superior” and her\r\nnuns from all blame in this matter, when we remember that there was a\r\n“Master of the Nuns” {154f} and other male officials who, indeed,\r\nbattened on the Priory in such numbers, that it was even said that they\r\nwere more numerous than the sisters. {154g}\r\n\r\nI have dwelt thus at some length on these details, because Stixwould is\r\nthe next parish to Woodhall, and within easy access of the visitor to the\r\nSpa; further, this Priory, like that of Sempringham in the south of the\r\ncounty, occupies a peculiar position, being one of a limited number of\r\nsuch establishments, which harboured the two sexes, canons as well as\r\nnuns, within their walls; an arrangement of questionable wisdom and\r\npropriety. {154h}  We have only to add that this Priory was suppressed by\r\nHenry VIII., with other lesser monasteries, in the 28th year of his\r\nreign; but in the following year, out of the sincere devotion that he had\r\nto the Virgin Mary, and for the increase of virtue, and the divine\r\nworship, “he reconstituted it, as a Pre-monstratensian Monastery, to\r\nconsist of a Prioress and Nuns, to officiate . . . for the good estate of\r\nhim and of his most dear consort, Jane, Queen of England, while they\r\nlived, and after their deaths for their souls, and the souls of their\r\nchildren and progenitors,” and he re-endowed it with all the possessions\r\nwhich it had previously held. {155a}  Unfortunately, as Henry’s love for\r\nhis consorts was not remarkable for its stability, neither was the\r\nsingular favour which he thus showed to the Priory, for, two years\r\nafterwards, he again, and finally, dissolved it, and granted it to John\r\nDighton.  Sic transit!\r\n\r\nOther objects of interest have been found in Stixwould.  My friend, the\r\nlate Vicar, {155b} writes “I found two glass ‘bottle stamps,’ 1⅜ ins. in\r\ndiameter; one of these has the figure of a dog, and ‘Rowles,’ in printed\r\nletters, beneath it; the other has ‘Anth. Boulton, Stixwo. 1722.’  The\r\nBoultons lived at the ‘Abbey farm’ for several generations, until the one\r\n(already mentioned) who committed murder.  The bottles were made more\r\nlike ship decanters, or the flagons of Australian wines, than our\r\nordinary bottles.  I also found many small pieces of mediæval pottery,\r\nsome pieces of ‘puzzle jugs,’ with holes, and the neck of a ‘pilgrim’s\r\nbottle,’ of Cistercian ware, so called, as I was told by the late Sir\r\nAugustus Franks, of the British Museum, because it has only been found on\r\nthe sites of Cistercian houses.  The colour of mediæval pottery is as\r\nsuperior to the modern as ancient glass is to that of the present day,\r\nand it is sometimes tastefully ornamented with finger marks.  The stone\r\ncoffins, by the tower of Stixwould Church, were dug up where the Abbey\r\nChurch formerly stood, in the field at the back of the present Abbey farm\r\norchard.”\r\n\r\nThere are several large blocks of stone, at different farmyards, which\r\ncame from the Abbey.  The stocks, until a few years ago, stood in the\r\ncentre of the junction of the Horsington and Woodhall Spa roads, at the\r\neast end of the village street.\r\n\r\nHORSINGTON.—About two miles from Stixwould, north-eastward, is\r\nHorsington, its name, probably, being compounded of the Saxon elements\r\nhorse-ing-ton _i.e._, the village with horse-meadows; that the central\r\nsyllable is not the patronymic “ing” is evident, since about a mile away\r\nwe have, also, Poolham “Ings,” which are rich meadow lands on that, the\r\nadjoining, manor.  The present church of Horsington is modern, having\r\nbeen built in 1860, of brick, with stone dressings, in place of a\r\nprevious very poor thatched structure, into which one entered by a\r\ndescent of two steps, with something of the feeling of descending into a\r\ndripping well.  The present edifice is neat, but of no great\r\narchitectural merit, and is already, in parts, becoming dilapidated, the\r\nstonework of the spire being much weatherworn.  It is not, however,\r\nstrictly speaking, the parish church, but rather a chapel of ease.  The\r\nancient church was “All Hallows,” the site of which is shewn by a mound\r\nin the fields to the south-west of the present village, at a point which\r\nis almost equi-distant from Stixwould in the south, Bucknall to the west,\r\nand Horsington village itself; and is said, traditionally, to have been\r\nthe common church of all three parishes before their present churches\r\nwere built.  Separated from it now by a small drain is the old burial\r\nground.  Tradition connects this site with the Fire-ceremony of November,\r\nin British times, once prevalent in Asia, as well as Europe, and even in\r\nAmerica.  The beginning of the year was then fixed by the culminating of\r\nthe constellation Pleiades, in November.  On the first of the month\r\nbonfires were lighted, as they have been by the Welsh in quite recent\r\ntimes, and, along with the fire, the emblem of purity, offerings were\r\nmade on behalf of the dead, the sacrifices of animals being so numerous\r\non this and other days, that the month acquired the name of Blot-monath,\r\n_i.e._, Blood-month.  The Venerable Bede, {156} tells us that, at the\r\nrequest of Pope Boniface, A.D. 611, the Emperor Phocas ordered, according\r\nto a general practice, that, on the site, in Rome, where “all the gods”\r\nhad been worshipped, which was called the Pantheon, the filth of idolatry\r\nbeing abolished, a church should be erected in memory of the Blessed\r\nVirgin and all Martyrs; and on this principle, in other places also, the\r\nsite of the heathen worship, and the day of its special observance, were\r\ntransformed into the occasion and place of observance of the Christian\r\nfestival of “All Hallows,” or “All Saints” day; and in the course of\r\nre-corrupting time the offering on behalf of the dead by the heathen, and\r\nthe commemorative ceremony of the early Christian, passed into “prayers\r\nfor the dead,” which became general in a later age.  Further, to give\r\ntheir sympathies a wider compass, the old “Golden Legend” tells us that\r\n“Saynt Odylle ordeyned that the feast and remembraunce of all them that\r\nben departed (generally) out of this worlde sholde be holden in al\r\nmonasteryes, the daye after the fest Halowen (All Hallows even); the\r\nwyche thynge was approved after all holye Chyrche.” {157}  This is the\r\nold Christian black-letter festival of “All Souls,” generally, as\r\ndistinguished from the red-letter, “All Saints day.”  Such are some of\r\nthe old traditions which hang, like evergreen garlands, round our sacred\r\nplaces.  Children may once have “passed through fire to Molech” where now\r\nthe heaving turf shrouds the skeleton of a decayed church.\r\n\r\nOn the walls of the church are tablets with the following\r\ninscriptions:—“To the beloved memory of Frederick Evan Cowper Smith,\r\nLieutenant, Royal Artillery, eldest son of the late T. F. Smith formerly\r\nRector of this Parish.  He died of Fever, brought on by over-exertion in\r\nthe discharge of his duty, while on active service in Afghanistan, with\r\nthe Kyber Line Field Force, on July 26th, 1880, when he had just\r\ncompleted 19 years of earthly life.  Jesu Mercy.”  A second is as\r\nfollows:—“Sacred to the memory of Arthur Monro Cowper Smith, Captain in\r\nthe Royal Field Artillery, and graduate of Trinity College, Cambridge; he\r\ndied at Beira, East Africa, on Sept. 28, 1898, in the 36th year of his\r\nage, of injuries received in a grass fire while shooting big game on the\r\nPungwe River.  He was the second son of the Rev. T. F. Smith, B.D., late\r\nRector of this Parish.”\r\n\r\nAnother tablet is in memory of the Rev. T. F. Smith, B.C., “formerly\r\nFellow of St. Mary Magdalen College, Oxford, and Rector of this parish,\r\nwho died May 21, 1871, aged 50.”\r\n\r\nA fourth is to the memory of Colonel Bonar Millett Deane, second son of\r\nRev. G. Deane, late Rector of Bighton.  He died in South Africa,\r\ngallantly leading a column of the 58th Regiment, under General Colley, at\r\nthe battle of Laing’s Nek, January 28, 1881, aged 46 years.  “He fought a\r\ngood fight, he kept the faith.  Jesu Mercy.”  He was a relative of the\r\nlate Rector, the Rev. F. H. Deane, B.D., afterwards Rector of South\r\nKilworth, Rugby.\r\n\r\nA document in the parish chest shews that the burial ground was, at one\r\ntime, _re-purchased_ for a burial, and fenced in, while other papers shew\r\nhow this came about, viz., that the duty of the parishioners to keep up\r\nthe churchyard fence had been neglected (as has also occurred in other\r\nplaces in this neighbourhood), and so the land lapsed, and had to be\r\nrecovered.  In these papers, both church and chapel are named as\r\ndistinct, which again is confirmed by the Will {158} of John Kele, parson\r\nof Horsington, 26 January, 1540, in which he directs that his body shall\r\nbe “buryed in the Quire of All Hallows,” and bequeaths to “the church of\r\nHorsington on mass boke (one mass book), on port huse (Breviary), on boke\r\ncalled Manipulus Curatorum”; he adds, “I also wyll that on broken\r\nchalyce, that I have, be sold, and _wared_ off the chancell of the\r\nchapell of Horsington; proved 17 Feb. 1540.”  Here he is to be buried at\r\nAll Hallows, and makes a bequest to the “Horsington Church,” this\r\nevidently again being All Hallows; but the money produced by the sale of\r\nthe broken chalice is to be _wared_ (note the Lincolnshire word, _i.e._,\r\nspent) on “the chancell of the chapell.”  The pilgrim from Woodhall Spa\r\ncan find his way by a pleasant walk of 2½ miles, mostly through the\r\nfields, northwards from the Bath-house, or along the Stixwould-road,\r\nre-entering the fields a little westward of “Miser’s Row,” and so by\r\nHalstead Hall, and to All Hallows.  We now proceed to later incidents in\r\nHorsington history.  There are the traces of two old moated mansions, one\r\non the right of the road going from Woodhall Spa, about a quarter of a\r\nmile before reaching the village: there is now a small farmhouse within\r\nthe moat, which is shaded by its sallows or willow trees.  Nearly\r\nopposite, a cross cut in the turf by the road shews where a man was\r\nkilled some years ago.  The other traces are to be seen in the field just\r\nto the south of the present churchyard.  The field is still called “Hall\r\nclose,” and the moats, ponds, and mounds cover some two acres.  It has\r\nbeen the residence of a family of importance; and we find among the list\r\nof those gentry who contributed their £25 to the Armada Fund the name of\r\nRobert Smythe, --- of Horsington.  In the register of burials is the\r\nentry, dated 1671, “Bridget Hall wiff of Robert Hall buried in her own\r\nyard Dec. 1st, 1671.”  She lived at “Hall farm,” near the road from\r\nHorsington to Bucknall; and deeming it popish to lie east and west in a\r\nchurchyard, she directed that her body should be buried north and south\r\nin her own garden.  Some years ago the occupier, in digging a drain\r\nbetween the house and the road, came upon a skeleton lying north and\r\nsouth, presumably that of Bridget Hall.\r\n\r\nHere is another odd circumstance.  We now have our splendid county\r\nasylums for our lunatics, but the writer can remember the case of an\r\nunfortunate lunatic who was kept chained to the kitchen fire-place in a\r\nhouse in Horncastle, was never unchained, and slept on the brick floor.\r\nAt Horsington the parish officers made special provision for the insane.\r\nIn the parish chest there was, until quite recently, {159} a brass\r\ncollar, to which was attached a chain for securing the unfortunate\r\nindividual by the neck.  The writer was lately informed by an old\r\nHorsington man, over 80 years of age, that the last occasion on which\r\nthis collar was used was early in the 19th century.  A villager then\r\nresiding near the present blacksmith’s shop, and named Joe Kent, had two\r\ninsane daughters, who had a very strong antipathy to each other, so that\r\nthey had always to be kept apart, or they would have killed each other.\r\nMy informant took me to what formerly was the garden of Kent’s house, and\r\npointed out two spots where these two unfortunate creatures were, in fine\r\nweather, chained to the wall, one by the neck and the other by the waist,\r\nabout 15 yards apart.  When within doors they were similarly secured in\r\nseparate rooms, treatment, surely, which was calculated to aggravate\r\nrather than alleviate their afflictions, but those were days in which\r\nrough remedies were too often resorted to.\r\n\r\nHorsington was further connected with an incident which, had it not been\r\nnipped in the bud, might have had most serious national consequences,\r\nviz., what is known as “the Cato street conspiracy,” the leader of which\r\nwas Arthur Thistlewood, a native of Horsington.  His proper name was\r\nBurnett, the name of his mother, he not being born in wedlock.  She was\r\nthe daughter of a small shopkeeper in the village.  Thistlewood, his\r\nfather, was a farmer, and Burnett was brought up with the rest of\r\nThistlewood’s family.  Possibly his peculiar position may have soured his\r\ntemper.  The following extracts taken from a recent publication give\r\ncontemporary information as to the details of this dangerous and\r\ndaringly-conceived plot. {160}  The Earl of Hardwick, writing to Lady\r\nElizabeth Stuart, then in Paris, Feb. 24, 1820, states that he had, in\r\nLondon, just received information of a plot to assassinate ministers as\r\nthey came from dinner at Lord Harrowby’s.  (The Duke of Berry had been\r\nassassinated in Paris, at the door of the Opera House, on Feb. 13th,\r\n1820, only eleven days before.)  Thirty men, his lordship says, were\r\nfound in a hay-loft, all armed.  Notice had been privately given to the\r\npolice of the plot, and the dinner had been consequently postponed.\r\nThese men had probably met to consider the cause of this postponement.\r\nNine of the party were taken, the rest escaping by a rope ladder.  Lord\r\nHardwick, writing again at 4 p.m. the same day, says, “I have just seen\r\nthe leaders of the horrible plot . . .  Thistlewood was taken to the\r\nTreasury, where he was about to be examined.  Townshend the police\r\nofficer asked if I would like to see him . . . he was sitting over the\r\nfire without his hat; it was easy to distinguish him from the rest, by\r\nthe character of ferocity which marked his countenance, which had a\r\nsingularly bad expression . . . Sir Charles Flint took me to another\r\nroom, where there were several of the arms taken; 7 pistols and bayonets,\r\n4 daggers, or pike heads, two feet in length; and some muskets.  A\r\nsergeant of the guard was wounded in the arm by a ball which had passed\r\nthrough his hand; he also received three balls in the crown of his hat.”\r\nThistlewood was taken in White Cross Street, near Finsbury Square, in his\r\nbed.  The place where the conspirators were discovered by the police was\r\nthe loft of a stable at the “Horse and Groom” public-house, in John\r\nStreet, Portman Square, which is between the square and Edgware Road.\r\nThey were to have forced themselves into the house, at Lord Harrowby’s,\r\nwhile dinner was going on, which they could easily have done by knocking\r\nat the door and then overpowering the footmen; or, according to another\r\nversion, to have assassinated the ministers as they came away in a body.\r\n\r\nThe Countess of Caledon, writing, about the same date, to Lady Elizabeth\r\nStuart, says, “Since the Gunpowder Plot there has been nothing so\r\nterrible.  Sir Willm. Scott says there was a plan to set London on fire\r\nin twelve places.  They only waited for the signal that the assassination\r\nhad taken place at Lord Harrowby’s.  Seven thousand persons were ready\r\nthat night to act on the signal.  We should never have escaped a\r\nRevolution.”\r\n\r\nTruly the Horsington lunatic’s collar might well have been employed in\r\ncurtailing the movements of this seditious native; but the public safety\r\nwas more effectually secured by hanging him on May 1st in the same year,\r\n1820. {161a}\r\n\r\nThe church bell bears the date 1754, with founder’s name, “Dan Hedderly.”\r\nI may add that one of the bells in St. Mary’s Church, Horncastle, has the\r\ninscription “Supplicem Deus audit.  Daniel Hedderly cast me, 1727.”  In\r\nthe present churchyard at Horsington grows the St. Mary’s thistle\r\nreferred to in a previous chapter, among the Flora.  I find a note with\r\nreference to the same plant growing in a field near Somerford Grange, the\r\nfarm of the monks of Christchurch.  “It is supposed to have been brought\r\nfrom the Holy Land, and only found near Religious Houses.” {161b}  The\r\nwriter happens to know that, in this case, the plant was imported some 20\r\nyears ago from Kirkstead, where it is now extinct.  Had it a tongue to\r\nspeak with, it would appeal to the pity of the visitor in the words “Noli\r\nme tangere.”\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nBUCKNALL lies barely two miles from Horsington, to the west.  The name\r\n(Buckehale in Domesday Book, or Buckenhall) would seem to indicate a\r\nformer hall, or mansion, surrounded by beech trees; {161c} and in a\r\nfield, still called “Hallyards,” to the south of the village, there are\r\ntraces of such a residence, near the farm now occupied by Mr. W. Carter.\r\nThis was probably the home of the Saxon Thorold, Sheriff of Lincoln, and\r\nlord of the demesne, before the Conquest.  His daughter, the Lady Godiva\r\n(or God’s gift), of Coventry fame, and probably born here, married\r\nLeofric, the powerful Earl of Mercia.  She was a great benefactress to\r\nthe Church.  Thorold gave to the monastery of St. Guthlac at Croyland,\r\n“for the salvation of his soul,” land in Bucknall, comprising “1\r\ncarucate, {162} with 5 villiens, 2 bordars, and 8 soc-men, with another\r\ncarucate; meadow 120 acres, and wood 50 acres.”  The two principal\r\nfeatures in the village are now the rectory house and the church.  The\r\nformer, a substantial old gabled building, standing in a large\r\nold-fashioned garden, probably dates back some 300 years.  By a curious\r\narrangement, in some of the rooms the fireplace stands in the corner,\r\ninstead of in the centre of the room wall.  The church, dedicated, like\r\nso many others in the neighbourhood, to St. Margaret, has no very\r\nstriking features.  Its architecture is mainly Early English, with some\r\ntraces of Norman; embattled tower, with four pinnacles, and conical roof.\r\nIt has been renovated and improved at various periods.  In 1704 it was\r\nre-roofed and considerably altered.  It was thoroughly restored in 1882,\r\nat a cost of about £1,500, the older features being judiciously retained.\r\nThe late rector, Rev. E. W. Lutt, introduced a new Communion table,\r\nchancel rails, and lamps.  In 1899 a handsome carved eagle lectern was\r\ngiven by his parishioners and friends.  Under the present rector, Rev. W.\r\nH. Benson-Brown, a beautifully-carved oak reredos, of chaste design, was\r\nerected, and dedicated Sept. 17, 1902.  Two coloured windows were\r\npresented, and dedicated Dec. 23, 1903, the subject of one being St.\r\nMargaret, the patron saint of the church; that of the other, St. Hugh,\r\npatron saint of the diocese.  The inscription on the former is “To the\r\nglory of God, and in loving memory of Jessie Syme Elsey, who entered into\r\nrest May 1st, 1903.  This window was given by her sisters Louisa Pepper\r\nand Nancy Margaret Richardson.”  The inscription of the other window is\r\n“To the glory of God, and in loving memory of Robert Brown, who entered\r\nrest Nov. 21st, 1897, also of Mary Jane Brown, who entered rest March\r\n22nd, 1903.  This window was given by their son, W. H. Benson-Brown,\r\nRector.”  Through the Rector’s efforts coloured glass is shortly also to\r\nbe placed in the chancel east window.  A processional cross was presented\r\nto the church as a thankoffering, by the Rector and Mrs. Brown, on the\r\nrecovery of their son, Langton Benson-Brown, after a serious operation,\r\nSept. 11th, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe churchyard was enlarged, and consecrated by the Bishop, May 22nd,\r\n1900.\r\n\r\nThe general plan of the church is nave, with small north and south\r\naisles, and chancel.  At the east end of the south aisle, in the south\r\nwall, is a piscina; a slab of considerable size below it, indicating that\r\nthis has been formerly a chantry, with altar at the east end, lit up by\r\ntwo small windows, one in the eastern wall, the other over the piscina.\r\nIn the easternmost bay of the north arches, which now extends within the\r\nchancel, there is, at the base of the arch moulding, a nun’s head.  This,\r\nhowever, is believed to be modern work, introduced at the restoration.\r\nThe pulpit is of old oak, nicely carved, with peculiar Masonic-looking\r\ndesign, the money for its erection being left by Henry Taylor, Esq., of\r\nAll Hallows, Barking, in 1646.  The font is hexagonal, having a simple\r\nsemi-circular moulding in the centre on four sides, the other sides being\r\nplain.  There is a good old oak parish chest in the tower.  The tower,\r\nexternally, has two good original gurgoyles, the other two being modern.\r\n\r\nThe Communion plate was “the gift of Mrs. Hannah Ashley, 1786.”  In the\r\nchancel is a pewter alms dish, with the name “Bucknall,” and the date,\r\nhardly legible, “1680.”  The bell of the church is evidently ancient, and\r\nhas several curious devices graven upon it, including a Tudor Rose,\r\nbeneath which are four crosses, alternating with four capital S’s;\r\nbesides these, there is a long cross, with upper end branching into a\r\ntrefoil, its lower end forming a fork, resting on a circle, on each side\r\nbeing a smaller stem, slightly foliating at top.\r\n\r\nOn the east side of the south doorway is an old stone having a sundial\r\ngraven on it; now built into masonry which must have come from some other\r\npart of the fabric.  Opposite the porch, in the churchyard, slightly\r\nraised above the path, is a large, flat square stone, nearly a yard\r\nbroad, and with some moulding below.  This is called “the tithe stone.”\r\nIt may have been the base of a churchyard cross; but, as in olden times\r\nthe cross often served as a place of barter and business, it may well\r\nalso have received the tithes and other dues belonging to the rector.\r\n(See “Old Stone Crosses,” by Elias Owen, 1886.)  I may add that there was\r\na similar stone in the churchyard in the neighbouring parish of\r\nWaddingworth.\r\n\r\nA list of non-jurors connected with this parish in 1715 has the following\r\nnames:—“Susanna Smith, widow, £10 0s. 0d.; William Smith, gent, £30 0s.\r\n0d.; Samuel Martin, gent., £36 0s. 0d.”  (It may be remembered that\r\nnon-jurors were subject to double taxation, although they erred in such\r\ncompany as the saintly Bishop Ken and other prelates.)\r\n\r\nIt may be further mentioned that in the reign of Charles I. an inhabitant\r\nof this parish, Mr. Thomas Toking (who was also of Ludgate Hill, London),\r\npresented a petition to the King’s Commissioners, showing that he held\r\nunder the Bishop of Carlisle a lease of the manor of Horncastle, which\r\nhad been sequestered through the default of his predecessor, Rutland\r\nSnowden, and praying for a commission of enquiry.—State Papers, Domestic.\r\nChas. I.  Vol. 345, No. 42.\r\n\r\nThe Rector has supplied me with a list of the Rectors of Bucknall,\r\ncomplete, with the exception of the period between 1608 and 1660.  As\r\nthere are but few parishes of which such a record is obtainable, I give\r\nthis below, as interesting.  We notice among them two members of the\r\nformerly well-known family of Dighton; also another known name in Robert\r\nClifton.  Evan Yorke Nepean, Rector 1859–1868, afterwards succeeded his\r\nuncle in the baronetcy, while the second Rector, who held office from\r\n1227 to 1244 being named Eusebius, was probably a foreigner, and,\r\npossibly, as was common in those times, though enjoying the income, never\r\nresided in the parish, leaving his duties to be performed by a\r\nscantily-paid substitute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECTORS OF BUCKNALL FROM A.D. 1219.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard (clerk)                     1219\r\n\r\nEusebius                            1227\r\n\r\nBartholomew de Bukenhal             1244\r\n\r\nHenry                               ----\r\n\r\nWilliam Gascelyn                    1294\r\n\r\nWilliam de Rasen                    1297\r\n\r\nThomas de Swayneshaye               1298\r\n\r\nWalter de Maydenstone               1299\r\n\r\nRobert de Wythme                    1306\r\n\r\nJohn Denery                         1307\r\n\r\nRichard Mahen                       ----\r\n\r\nJohn Mahen de Chipping Norton       1318\r\n\r\nRichard de Norton                   ----\r\n\r\nRalph de Saleby                     1330\r\n\r\nRoger Sutton                        ----\r\n\r\nRichard Starkie                     1399\r\n\r\nRichard de Crumwell                 1406\r\n\r\nThomas de Grenley                   1410\r\n\r\nJohn Glaster                        1421\r\n\r\nJohn Endrik                         ----\r\n\r\nJohn Arthur                         1470\r\n\r\nJohn Archer                         ----\r\n\r\nRobert Clifton                      1503\r\n\r\nJohn Galyn                          ----\r\n\r\nJohn Sheffield                      1520\r\n\r\nJohn Robynson                       1530\r\n\r\nJohn Thorpe                         1546\r\n\r\nRobert Grawd                        1549\r\n\r\nArthur Wright                       1566\r\n\r\nEdward Wright                       1607\r\n\r\nNo record from                      1608 to 1660\r\n\r\nEverard Dighton                     1661\r\n\r\nWilliam Dighton                     1677\r\n\r\nBenjam.

These\r\nrequire a short notice.  This was a Præmonstratensian House, dedicated to\r\nthe Blessed Virgin, and founded by Robert, or, as some say, Ranulph, Nova\r\nVilla, or Nevill, who held lands _in capite_ of the King, from the\r\nConquest, the foundation being further augmented by Alan de Nevill and\r\nGilbert his brother, temp. Henry II.  Tanner states that at the time of\r\nits dissolution by Henry VIII. there were “nine religious” in the House,\r\nand the contemporary Leland, in his “Collectanea,” names two works which\r\nhe saw in the Tupholme Library, viz., Fulcherii Historia and Historiolæ\r\nde Britannia fragmentum. {165}  The properties of the Abbey were very\r\nconsiderable, lying in the parishes of Tupholme, Gautby, Langton,\r\nFranthorpe (where there was a Grange farm), Stixwould, Metheringham,\r\nLincoln, Boston, Middle Rasen, Ranby, West Ashby, Brokelesby, Stourton,\r\nGreat Coates, Louth, with the advowson of Stratton Church, and other\r\nplaces.  These ample possessions seem to have bred in the Priors a spirit\r\nof independence, and even of lawlessness; for, at an Inquisition, held at\r\nLincoln in the 13th century, it was stated that the Prior of the day had\r\nrefused to pay his Crown quit rents, and indulged in other illegal\r\nproceedings, besides claiming “free warren” over these different manors,\r\nwhich of right belonged to the King.  Another Prior was accused of\r\nforgery and counterfeiting the coin of the realm, {166a} with which he\r\npurchased corn and wine and disposed of them again at a profit.  He was\r\nalso charged with carrying on an extensive traffic in horn, {166b} and it\r\nis not a little curious, in connection with this last charge, that a Mr.\r\nPell, whom the writer, as a boy, knew well, residing at Tupholme Hall,\r\nfound, while his men were digging in the Abbey field, great quantities of\r\nthe pith, or core, of bullocks’ horns, all of which had been divested of\r\nthe outer coating.  Henry II. granted to the Prior, by Charter, a canal\r\nto the Witham; the course of similar canals can be traced at Stixwould\r\nPriory and Kirkstead Abbey, and thus articles of illegal traffic could be\r\nsmuggled down the Witham to foreign lands.  At the dissolution the site\r\nof the Abbey was given to Sir Thomas Heneage.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the Abbey are now small, forming one end, running north\r\nand south, of some farm buildings, with a small modern house attached,\r\nwhich helps to keep them standing; for, otherwise, they are so worn away\r\nat the lower part, by the cattle rubbing against them, that they would be\r\nin danger of falling; and of late years such a contingency has been\r\nevidently thought not unlikely, as a railing is now put up outside to\r\nkeep the cattle out of danger.  There are southward five upper Early\r\nEnglish windows in the remaining fragment, probably the wall of the\r\nRefectory; and two more ornamental windows of a small chamber, northward,\r\nwith a small narrow round-headed window, deeply let in, at the end; with\r\neight round arched recesses below, one of these being perforated, and\r\nforming an entrance to the refectory from the outside.  Fragments of\r\ncarved stones are also inserted in a modern wall at the north end.  A\r\nlocal tradition survives, that the place is haunted by a headless lady;\r\nand an instance is related by a labourer formerly living close by, who,\r\nwhen beating his wife, was so terrified by an apparition, which in his\r\nignorance he took to be “the Old Lad,” _i.e._, the Devil, that he\r\nhenceforth became a reformed character, and never belaboured his wife\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThere is a short cut over the fields from Stixwould to Tupholme Priory,\r\navailable for the pedestrian, but transit for the carriage is doubtful,\r\nas the cart track is a private accommodation road, though possibly the\r\nproverbial “silver key” may open the locks.  On the opposite side of the\r\nruins is Tupholme Hall, a large substantial brick building, with some\r\nfine timber about it.  The age of this house I do not know, but some\r\nspouting bears date 1789.  Tupholme can be reached by train to Southrey\r\nstation, with a walk of about a mile and a half, or from Bardney about\r\ntwo miles.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nWe now pass over two miles in thought, and reach Bardney.  Here we have\r\nthe largest church (St. Lawrence) in this neighbourhood; and though for a\r\nlong time it was left in a wretched condition, it was restored in 1878 at\r\na cost of £2,500, and is now in a very good condition.  Its chief\r\nfeatures of interest are as follows:—In the south wall of the chancel\r\nthere is a piscina; in the pavement north of the Communion table is a\r\nflat slab of Purbeck marble, with a cross and the initials C.S., with\r\ndate 1715.  The present Communion table is formed of a massive slab of\r\nLincoln limestone, 9 feet long, 4 feet in width, and 6 inches in\r\nthickness.  Inscribed on this are seven crosses, three at each end and\r\none in the front centre; they have evidently been scratched with a rude\r\ninstrument and are doubtless of early date.  The number of these crosses,\r\nseven, would imply that it was dedicated to some sacred purpose.  The\r\nstone was found under the floor of the nave, while operations were going\r\non for the restoration.  It is supposed to have been brought from the\r\nAbbey (of which we shall speak presently), and to have been the tombstone\r\nof King Oswald of Northumbria, who, as the Venerable Bede states (Book\r\niii.. c. vi.), was buried in the Abbey under the High Altar; although it\r\nis known that with the exception of one hand (which is said to have\r\nacquired miraculous powers) his remains were afterwards removed to\r\nGloucester.  The chancel is built of bricks, which resemble those of\r\nTattershall and Halstead Hall, and commonly called “Flemish;” but it is\r\nlikely that, as in the case of the two other buildings just named, they\r\nwere made in the neighbourhood, where there have been very extensive\r\nbrick and tile kilns, of so old a date as to have given its name to a\r\nsmall stream, which is called “Tile-house Beck.”  The chancel has angels\r\nbetween the main beams of the roof.  In the chancel arch south wall, on\r\nthe eastern side, are initials scratched, with dates 1443 and 1668.  The\r\nnave has north and south aisles with five bays, and Early English arches\r\nand columns, the plinths of these columns being unusually high—over three\r\nfeet, and those on the south being slightly higher than those on the\r\nnorth.  The aisle windows are debased.  The timber beams in the roof are\r\nof strong good oak; plain, except a central floriated device; the general\r\nboarding being of pine.  The east window has five lights, with fourteen\r\ndivisions above, within the low arch.  The register dates from 1653.  The\r\nCommunion plate is good, its date 1569.  The tower is massive, broad, and\r\nlow, with here and there a relic of Norman zigzag work built into the\r\nwalls.  There are four bells, large, and of good tone, the weight of the\r\nlargest being just short of one ton.  Their inscriptions are as follows:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) Soli Deo gloria (Churchwardens) T. T. & W. K. 1644.\r\n\r\n(_b_) W. S. (with Fleur de lys) Deus . . . 1670.\r\n\r\n(_c_)  Sanctus Dominus . . . 1663.\r\n\r\n(_d_)  Jhesus be our spede.  E. E.  R.R. a Rose.  1615.\r\n\r\nThe Abbey of Bardney, of which now nothing remains _in situ_ except a\r\nsepulchral barrow, dates from the Saxon Heptarchy, being one of the\r\noldest in the kingdom.  It was first built, says Dugdale {168a} by King\r\nEthelred, who himself, in 705, quitted his throne of Mercia, and,\r\nretiring to Bardney, became its Abbot for the last 13 years of his life.\r\nThe name of the actual founder, however, is lost in obscurity.  Leland\r\nsays {168b} that the monks themselves did not know it.  The barrow\r\nreferred to is called, to this day, the “coney-garth” or “King’s\r\nenclosure,” and Ethelred is supposed to have been buried there.  The\r\nAbbey was destroyed in 870, by the Danes, under their leaders Inguar and\r\nHubba, and 300 monks slaughtered before the altar.  It was re-built 200\r\nyears later, and re-endowed, by Gilbert de Gaunt, the powerful Norman\r\nbaron whose bounteous acts we have referred to more than once; and his\r\nson, Walter de Gaunt, in 1115, confirmed “to the church and monastery of\r\nSt. Peter, St. Paul and St. Oswald, all those lands and possessions which\r\nhis father had given in pure and perpetual alms to the same.”  And all\r\nthis was afterwards confirmed by Henry I. {169a}  It was a very wealthy\r\nestablishment of the Benedictine order.  The superior was one of the\r\ntwenty-five mitred Abbots in England; he was called the “Lord of\r\nLindsey,” had a seat in the House of Lords, and a palace in London.  At\r\nthe time when the body of Oswald, King of Northumbria, was buried here,\r\nthere were 300 monks in the Abbey, says Dugdale.  I have mentioned that\r\nwhen the body of King Oswald was afterwards transferred to Gloucester, a\r\nhand was retained, which acquired miraculous powers; the versions as\r\nregards this vary, but there is a legend that Aidan, Bishop of\r\nLindisfarne was dining with Oswald, there being a silver dish on the\r\nroyal table, well replenished, when the king’s almoner announced “that\r\nthere was a crowd of mendicants begging at the gate.  The king\r\nimmediately ordered the whole of the meat, and the dish itself, to be\r\ndivided among them.  This generosity so struck the bishop that he grasped\r\nthe king’s right hand, exclaiming that “it was impossible that a hand so\r\nmunificent should ever perish,” and the monks assert that it never did.\r\nAfter his death it was deposited as a holy relic in St. Peter’s Church at\r\nBebba, now called Bamborough.  Thence it was purloined by a monk of\r\nPeterborough (says William of Malmsbury) and deposited in the Abbey\r\nthere, where it is said, by Nicholas Harpsfield, to have remained in a\r\nperfect state till after the Reformation. {169b}\r\n\r\nIn the Record “Testa de Nevill” (p. 338) it is stated that, besides the\r\nlands given to the Abbey by Gilbert de Gaunt, in Bardenay, Surraye\r\n(Southrey), An-Goteby (Gautby), and elsewhere, Roger de Marmion (ancestor\r\nof the Dymokes of Scrivelsby) also endowed it with certain lands.  The\r\nAbbots held the advowsons of, or pensions from, the churches of Bardney,\r\nBarton-on-Humber, Sotby, Falkingham, Wlacot, Skendleby, Partney, Frisby,\r\nLusby, Baumber, Edlington, and half a dozen more.\r\n\r\nOf Bardney I have only one more particular to mention, a modern\r\nmiracle:—In the year 1898, in the hamlet of Southrey, an outlying part of\r\nthe parish, a church was built, where there had been none before, to\r\naccommodate 90 people; the builders, as in the historic case of St. Hugh\r\nof Avalon, carrying his hod at the erection of his own cathedral, were\r\nthe clergy, assisted by the parishioners generally, all carting being\r\ndone by the farmers; and the greatest zeal and interest being shewn by\r\nall parties.  It is a wooden structure, on a concrete foundation.  The\r\nfont was brought from the vicarage, probably being of the 15th century.\r\n\r\nAs I stand on this barrow, “coney-garth,” with the remains mouldering\r\nbeneath me, blending with their kindred earth, of the saintly Ethelred,\r\nwho in his singular devotion exchanged the crown of a king for the mitre\r\nof an abbot, I command a view, probably unrivalled in the world.  In the\r\nnear distance north-east are the buildings which occupy the site of the\r\nvaccary of Bardney Abbey, still called Bardney Dairies, and said to have\r\nbeen the original position of the abbey itself, before its destruction by\r\nthe Danes.  North-westward, beyond the woods, between two and three miles\r\naway, are the crumbling remains of Barlings Abbey, whose last abbot,\r\nMacharell (under the name of Captain Cobbler), headed the Lincolnshire\r\nRebellion, in the reign of Henry VIII., and for his offence was executed,\r\nalong with the contemporary Abbot of Kirkstead.  In the next village but\r\none to the west formerly stood the Priory of Minting, of which only\r\nmounds and ponds survive.  To the north of this was the Priory of\r\nBenedictine Nuns at Stainfield; while a few short miles again beyond this\r\nto the east was Bullington Priory; and crowning the north-western horizon\r\nstands the majestic Cathedral of Lincoln, around which clustered in its\r\nimmediate proximity fourteen monasteries; truly a region once rich beyond\r\ncompare in monastic institutions; the homes of devotion, if also,\r\nunhappily, of error and superstition; but the almost sole sources in\r\ntheir day “of light and leading”; but for whom we should now know but\r\nlittle or nothing of the distant past, since it was the monks who made\r\nand preserved for us our historic records, {171} they who multiplied our\r\nold MSS., they who were our great agriculturists, and they above all who\r\nhanded down to us the Word of Life.  Not far off to the east is a wood,\r\ncommonly called “Horsetaker wood,” but the term is really “Auster-acre,”\r\nthe eastern-acre or field (Latin, Australis ager); as at Bawtry there is\r\nland called by the similar name, “Auster-field,” and we have most of us\r\nheard of the battle of Austerlitz, when Napoleon conquered the forces of\r\nAustria and Russia, in 1805.  To the north lies another wood, known as\r\n“Hardy-gang” wood, a name derived from the following local\r\ntradition:—Once upon a time a wild man lived in the fastnesses of this\r\nwood (the woods about here were, within the writer’s recollection, much\r\nmore extensive than they now are); he wore no clothing; was covered with\r\nhair; and was the terror of the neighbourhood, raiding the sheep and\r\ncattle, and carrying off occasionally a child.  At length his maraudings\r\nbecame so excessive that a number of men banded together, binding\r\nthemselves not to rest until they had rid the country of this monster in\r\nhuman form.  They had a hard task to perform, but at length they did it,\r\nand their name of “the hardy gang” was passed on to the wood itself.\r\n\r\nContinuing our ramble, a walk of some five miles eastward, partly through\r\nfields, by a wide and evidently ancient footpath, trod, doubtless, by\r\nmany a monk of old, and skirting the above-named Auster-acre wood, we\r\narrive at the small and scattered village of Gautby, the property of the\r\nVyners.  We are here in a region of fine and stately timber, a suitable\r\nposition for a large, and handsome residence; but the hall was demolished\r\nseveral years ago, and only the gardens remain, enclosed by a high wall.\r\nIn such a place, and under such patronage, we should expect to find the\r\nchurch a handsome fabric, but, on the contrary, the visitor will be\r\nsurprised to see a mean, brick, small structure, with no pretensions\r\nwhatever to architectural beauty.  The old square pews are still\r\nretained, with some open sittings, all of oak, but without ornament;\r\npulpit and reading-desk, in keeping with these; the font is of wood with\r\nmarble basin, small, and of no beauty.  A small wooden gallery, for\r\nsingers, over the west door, reminds one of the days when our country\r\nchoirs were accompanied by hautboy, clarionet and fiddle, and almost the\r\nonly hymns were “Tate and Brady.”  The chancel is almost entirely paved\r\nwith tombstones of the Vyners.  One of these records the murder of F. G.\r\nVyner, Esq., by brigands in Greece, in the year 1870.  On the north and\r\nsouth sides of the Communion table are raised monuments, on which are\r\nsemi-recumbent figures in stone.  The inscription on the northern\r\nsepulchre runs as follows:—“At the instance of Thomas Vyner, Esqvire,\r\nClerke of the Patents, piously desiring to preserve the memorie of his\r\ndear Father, Sr Thomas Vyner deceased, His Executor Sr Robert Vyner,\r\nKnight and Baronet, caused this monument to be set up Anno. Dom. 1672.”\r\nThe south inscription is, “To the memorie of Thomas Vyner Esqr, second\r\nsonne of Sr Thomas Vyner, Knt. & Baronet, by Dame Honour, daughter of\r\nGeorge Humble Esqr, of this Parish, His second wife, this monument was\r\nerected, at the charge of Sr Robert Vyner, Knt and Baronet, sole executor\r\nof his last will and Testament.  Ano. Dni. 1673.”\r\n\r\nThe founder of the family of Vyner was Sir Robert, a wealthy London\r\nmerchant, who, like his father before him, lent money to ruined\r\nRoyalists, doubtless at a rate of interest which well repaid him.  He was\r\n_fond of his sovereign_, in more senses than one, as is shewn by the\r\nfollowing anecdote given in the “Spectator,” No. 462:—When Sir Robert\r\nVyner was Lord Mayor, in 1675, he entertained Charles II. in the\r\nGuild-hall; and this he did with so profuse hospitality, and withal\r\nrepeatedly toasting the royal family, that he soon began to treat his\r\nsovereign with a familiarity unduly loving.  The king understood very\r\nwell how to extricate himself from such a difficulty, and with a hint to\r\nthe company to avoid ceremony, he stole away and made for his coach,\r\nstanding in the Guild-hall yard.  But Sir Robert liked his Majesty’s\r\ncompany so well that he pursued him, and catching the king by the hand,\r\nhe cried out, with a round oath, “Sire, you shall stay and take t’ other\r\nbottle.”  Charles, recognising the inevitable, put a good face on the\r\nmatter, and, looking at him kindly, with a graceful air repeated this\r\nline of the old song,\r\n\r\n    “He that’s drunk is as great as a king.”\r\n\r\nHe immediately returned and complied with the invitation. {173}\r\n\r\nIn the park at Gautby there stood for many years an equestrian statue, of\r\nwhich the history is somewhat ludicrous.  It passed for a statue of\r\nCharles II.  Sir Robert Vyner, the hero of the above anecdote, presented\r\nit to the City of London, in 1675; and it was placed in the Stocks\r\nMarket, in honour of his Majesty.  The royal horseman bestrides a warlike\r\nsteed, which is trampling under foot the figure of a turbanned Turk.\r\nThis seems hardly an appropriate mode of representing a sovereign, who,\r\nso far from thirsting for deeds of war, could drink wine and play cards\r\nwhen the Dutch were burning our shipping in the Thames close by.  The\r\nStocks Market was eventually demolished, when the statue was transferred\r\nto Gautby Park, the Lincolnshire seat of the donor, whence it has in late\r\nyears been transferred to the Yorkshire seat of the Vyners—Newby Park,\r\nnear Ripon.  It had been originally intended to represent John Sobieski,\r\nKing of Poland, who was regarded as the saviour of Europe from the\r\nMussulman power; and for him, the Turk trampled under foot was a fitting\r\nemblem.  When the statue was taken down in 1738, the following satiric\r\nlines were circulated and sung in the streets:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“The last dying speech and confession of the Horse at Stock’s Market.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ye whimsical people of London’s fair town\r\n    Who one day put up, what the next day pull down;\r\n    Full sixty-one years, have I stood in this place,\r\n    And never, till now, met with any disgrace!\r\n    What affront to crowned heads could you offer more bare,\r\n    Than to pull down a king to make room for a mayor?\r\n    The great Sobieski, on horse with long tail,\r\n    I first represented, when set up for sale;\r\n    A Turk, as you see, was placed under my feet,\r\n    To prove o’er the Sultan my conquest compleat.\r\n    Next, when against monarchy all were combined,\r\n    I, for your Protector, old Noll, was designed.\r\n    When the King was restored, you then, in a trice,\r\n    Called me Charly the Second; and, by way of device,\r\n    Said the old whiskered Turk had Oliver’s face,\r\n    Though you know to be conquered he ne’er had the disgrace.\r\n    Three such persons as these on one horse to ride,\r\n    A Hero, Usurper, and King, all astride:—\r\n    Such honours were mine; though now forced to retire,\r\n    Perhaps my next change may be still something higher,\r\n    From a fruitwoman’s market, I may leap to a spire.\r\n    As the market is moved, I am forced to retreat;\r\n    I could stay there no longer, with nothing to eat.\r\n    Now the herbs and the greens are all carried away,\r\n    I must go unto those who will find me in hay.”\r\n\r\nSo the old horse, after serving varied purposes, and more than one\r\n“flitting,” finds literally “a green old age” in his “retreat” in the\r\ngreat horse county; a standing memorial, in stone, of a Lord Mayor’s\r\n“zeal” _not_ “tempered with knowledge.”  But his memory is not allowed to\r\nperish, for in the neighbouring training stables a favourite name among\r\nthe fleet racers is Sobieski.\r\n\r\nA pleasant walk of less than a mile over meadows, or “Ings,” brings us to\r\nthe village of Minting, the last syllable of its name, possibly, being\r\nderived from the said “Ings.”  Here, as has been already mentioned,\r\nformerly existed a Priory of Benedictine monks, a “cell” or offshoot of\r\nthe Gallic monastery of St. Benedict super Loira, and founded in 1129 by\r\nRanulph de Meschines, Earl of Chester.  No buildings remain above-ground,\r\nbut they must have been very extensive, as mound and hollow and stew pond\r\ncover an area of four or five acres.  The benefice is in the gift of St.\r\nJohn’s College, Cambridge.  The church, previously a very poor structure,\r\nwas restored by the Vicar, the Rev. F. Bashforth, in 1863, at a cost of\r\nover £800, the late Mr. Ewan Christian being the architect.  The font is\r\nmodern, but handsome, in form hexagonal.  There is a north aisle with\r\nthree bays and Norman arches.  Three windows in the north wall and two in\r\nthe south are debased.  The east window is a good sample of the\r\nPerpendicular, and on the outside has figureheads of king and queen, as\r\nterminals of the moulding.  A curious slab, carved on both sides,\r\nformerly lay loose in the porch, having been part of a churchyard cross.\r\nAt the restoration it was cut into two sections, and these were placed on\r\nthe east wall of the nave, north and south of the chancel arch, thus\r\nshewing the two carved surfaces.  The device on the northern one is a\r\nrude representation of the Crucifixion; the Saviour’s legs are crossed,\r\nand a figure stands on either side, probably St. John and the Virgin.\r\nBelow is a rudely-cut foliated pattern.  The design of the slab on the\r\nsouth, formerly the back, is also rude foliation.  On the north wall of\r\nthe chancel there is an oval brass tablet to the memory of Gulielmus\r\nChapman, of which one is tempted to say that, unless the individual\r\ncommemorated was an almost more than human embodiment of all the virtues,\r\nthe author of the epitaph must have acted on the principle recommended by\r\nthe poet Matthew Prior,—\r\n\r\n    Be to his virtues very kind,\r\n    And to his faults a little blind.\r\n\r\nIt runs as follows:—“Gulielmus Chapman, Probus, Doctus, Lepidus,\r\nFacundus, Hic jacet.  Pietate, Fidelitate, Benignitate, Modestiâ, Nulli\r\nSecundus, Hanc Vicariam bis 20 et octo annos tenuit.  Clarus in Umbra,\r\nRarâ in senectute Emicuit, Die 14 Aprilis decessit, Anno Ætat. 82, Anno\r\nDom. 1722.”\r\n\r\nThe villagers of this parish, 100 years ago, are said to have exercised\r\nthe art of weaving on a considerable scale, and one of the writer’s\r\nparishioners states that his grandmother lived there and had a hand-loom.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nA walk of less than two miles, chiefly across the fields, brings us to\r\nWispington.  We have already mentioned {175} the presence here of moats,\r\nmounds, and portions of a former old mansion of the Phillips family,\r\nutilized in existing farm buildings.  We have only now to notice the\r\nchurch, which does not call for much remark.  It was rebuilt on the site,\r\nand partly of the materials, of the previously-existing church, in 1863,\r\nat a cost of £1,500, by the Rev. C. P. Terrott, late vicar, and one of\r\nour greatest local antiquaries.  He himself designed the font and stone\r\npulpit, and also executed the devices which adorned them, representing\r\ngroups of different animals named in the Bible.  The tower is supported\r\non buttresses, on a principle adopted from the church of Old Woodhall,\r\nwhich is peculiar, but simple and effective.  In the vestry there is a\r\nslab, in the floor, of a former rector, John Hetherset, holding a chalice\r\nwith hands in many-buttoned gloves.  Built into the vestry wall are the\r\ncapitals of two small Norman pillars, which were dug up near the church,\r\nand doubtless formed part of the older Norman building.  Propped up\r\nagainst the vestry wall is a Jacobean altar-stone, formerly on the\r\nCommunion table, one of the very few in England.  The two mediæval bells\r\nare dedicated to the Virgin Mary.  The east window has modern coloured\r\nglass, the subject being the crucifixion, and scenes in the life of our\r\nSaviour.  In the north wall of the nave is a window of coloured glass,\r\ncommorative of the late vicar, C. P. Terrot; and in the south wall of the\r\nchancel is another, commemorating his son, Capt. Charles Terrott; in the\r\nsouth nave wall, near the font, is a brass tablet, with the Tyrwhitt\r\narms, erected by the late Rev. Beauchamp St. John Tyrwhitt, vicar, in\r\nmemory of his brother Robert.  The west window is of coloured glass, the\r\nsubject being St. Margaret and St. John the Baptist.\r\n\r\nEdlington Church (St. Helen’s)—the village being a very scattered one,\r\nwith scarcely two houses contiguous—stands to the east, some two miles\r\nfrom Wispington.  It was rebuilt, except the lower part of the tower, in\r\n1859–60.  The pulpit, reading desk, lectern, and sittings are all of oak,\r\nmodern and plain, but substantial.  There are three bells.  Edlington\r\npark is nicely wooded with some good timber, though much of it has been\r\nfelled of late years.  There was formerly a good residence on the\r\nnorthern rising ground, but it was pulled down “in the forties” by the\r\nthen owner, J. Hassard Short, Esq., and only the kitchen gardens and fish\r\nponds remain.  In a field near at hand there were found, several years\r\nago, a number of heaps of oxbones, each heap also containing an ancient\r\nurn, supposed to have been connected with Roman sacrifices; but, as Dr.\r\nOliver {176} derives the name Edlington from Eiddileg, a mystic character\r\nin the Bardic mythology, these may be the remnants of some other heathen\r\nsuperstition.\r\n\r\nA walk across the park and over a couple of fields southward brings us to\r\nthe village of Thimbleby, which consists of a “street” of small cottages\r\nand two or three larger dwelling-houses.  There is here an old manor,\r\ncalled “Hall-garth,” with an interesting old house with gables, thatched\r\nroof, some panelled rooms, a large fish pond, an old-time garden with yew\r\nhedges fantastically trimmed, and a fine old tree or two.  In a field\r\ncalled “the Park,” at the east end of the parish, are some fine trees,\r\nremnants of a former avenue.  The ancient well, said to be Roman, in the\r\nrectory grounds, has already been mentioned.  The church was re-fashioned\r\nin 1879, and an old, nondescript, flat-ceiled structure was converted\r\ninto a substantial and well-designed edifice of Early Decorated style,\r\nwith clock-tower and good clock, which gives out its notes of time to the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWe are now within a mile of Horncastle; somewhat weary after our long\r\nexplorations, let us wend our way on to the old town, and seek rest and\r\nrefreshment at the well-appointed and almost historic hostel which is\r\nready to welcome us beneath “ye Signe of ye Bull.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nRe-invigorated, after the prolonged explorations of the last chapter, by\r\na much-needed rest at the hostel of “The Bull,” we now prepare for our\r\nfinal round of visitation among the still remaining objects of interest\r\nin the neighbourhood.  And first we may seek enlightenment as to the\r\nmeaning of “the sign” of our inn, for such signs are ofttimes\r\nsignificant.  For this we have not far to go.  Looking out of the window\r\nof the snug little parlour we are occupying, we see before us what an\r\nIrishman might call a triangular square—a sort of “Trivium,” where three\r\nways meet, and where men not seldom congregate for trivial converse,\r\nalthough on market days it is the scene of busy barter, and at mart, or\r\nfair, transactions in horse, and other, flesh are negotiated with dealers\r\nof many kindreds, peoples, and tongues; but more of this anon.  On the\r\nfar side of this open space, “the Red Lion” bravely faces us, lashing its\r\ntail in rivalry.  In the centre we notice a large lamppost (recently\r\nerected by the Urban Council; in 1897).  At this spot, well within living\r\nmemory, was to be seen a large iron ring, securely embedded in a stone in\r\nthe pavement, of goodly dimensions.  This was “the Bull King,” and the\r\nopen space still perpetuates the name.  Here the ancient sport of\r\nbull-baiting was practised annually for the brutal, but thoughtless,\r\ndelectation of the people of town and country side. {178}  I find a note\r\nthat on April 21, 1887, I conversed with an old woman, and, as a link\r\nwith what is passed, never to return, I may here give her name,—Judith\r\nThornley, daughter of W. Elvin, farmer, of Baumber,—and then 84 years of\r\nage, who remembered the Bull ring, as I also do, and who, as a child,\r\nraised on her father’s shoulders to see over the crowd, witnessed more\r\nthan one bull-baiting.  On one such occasion she saw a woman gored by the\r\nbull, its horns piercing her bowels, although it was secured by the nose\r\nto the ring, the crowd being so great that she was thrust within the\r\ndangerous area by those pressing upon her from behind.  This, she\r\nreckoned, would be about the year 1809 or 1810.  As Mr. Weir, in his\r\n“History of Horncastle,” dated 1820, makes no reference to this practice,\r\nwe may assume that the old lady was about right in her calculation.\r\n\r\nNearly opposite our hostel may be noticed, at the corner, a saddler’s\r\nshop.  This was established in the year 1760, and, situated as the shop\r\nis in the centre of the great fair, Messrs. H. and W. Sharp receive\r\norders for various articles, in connection with horseflesh, from foreign\r\nas well as English customers.  Conversing with the head of this firm at\r\nthe time of this writing, I found that within the last few months they\r\nhad received commissions not only from various parts of England, Wales,\r\nScotland and Ireland, but from Belgium, Norway, France and Germany; some\r\nhandsome harness, which I recently saw being made by them, was for\r\nBerlin.  Opposite the entrance to the Bull is a smaller inn, the “King’s\r\nHead,” which is thatched; one hundred years ago nearly every house in the\r\ntown was thatched, and by the terms of the Will by which this particular\r\ninn was devised to the present owner, it is required that it should\r\nalways remain thatched.  This, surely, is a proviso which might be\r\nlegitimately ignored; and, doubtless, in a few years’ time, thatching\r\nwill be a lost art.  The street to the right, running north, and now\r\nnamed North Street, was formerly called “The Mill-stones,” from two old\r\nabandoned millstones which lay near the northern end of it.  Half-way up\r\nthis street, a back street branching off to the left is called “Conging\r\nStreet,” and formerly near it was a well named “Conging Well.”  This term\r\nis derived from the old Norman-French _congé_, a permission, or licence;\r\nfrom very early times the lord of the manor levied a toll on all who\r\nwished to traffic at the great fairs which were established by ancient\r\ncharters of the Sovereign.  There formerly stood, near the present\r\nDispensary, an old house called the “Conging House,” where these tolls\r\nwere paid for the licence to trade. {179}\r\n\r\nA curious custom which formerly prevailed in the town at the time of the\r\ngreat fairs, and which continued to later than the middle of the 19th\r\ncentury, was the opening of what were termed “Bough-houses,” for the\r\nentertainment of visitors.  Horncastle has still an unusually large\r\nnumber of licensed public-houses, and not many years ago had nearly twice\r\nthe number, many of them with extensive stabling, for the accommodation\r\nof man and beast, at the fairs for which it is famous; but, beyond these,\r\nit was a custom, from time immemorial, that any private house could sell\r\nbeer without a licence, if a bough, or bush, was hung out at the door.\r\n{180}  This, no doubt, gave rise to the old saying, “good wine needs no\r\nbush,” _i.e._, the quarters where it was sold would need no bough or bush\r\nhung out to advertise its merits, as they would be a matter of common\r\nbruit.  This, as was to be expected, was a privilege liable to be abused,\r\nand, only to give one instance, a couple living in the town and owning a\r\nname not unknown at Woodhall Spa, are said to have ordered for themselves\r\na goodly barrel of beer to be ready for the fair, but, the barrel having\r\nbeen delivered two or three days before the fair commenced, they had\r\nthemselves tried its merits so frequently, that when the day arrived\r\nthere was none left to sell, and the barrel was unpaid for, with no means\r\nreceived to pay for it, while they themselves were no better for the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nOn “the Millstones,” about half-way up the street, a friend of the writer\r\nwitnessed, in the forties, a man selling his wife by auction, {181} who\r\nstood on the top of a barrel, with a halter round her neck, and a crowd\r\ncollected round, examining her merits, as might not long ago have been\r\nseen in a slave market in Egypt.  She was sold for £30, in the street,\r\nopposite a small inn then called “The Horse and Jocky,” and kept by a man\r\ncommonly called Banty Marshall.  I am not aware that it is more than a\r\ncoincidence, that, although the inn has now a different name, a device in\r\nthe window represents a cat on a barrel.  The parish stocks stood at the\r\ntop of this street, where the Court House now stands; they were last used\r\nin 1859, and were only removed on its erection in 1865.  The present\r\nwriter can remember seeing persons confined in the stocks; as also in a\r\nneighbouring village, where the parish clerk, after his return from the\r\nSaturday market, not uncommonly was put in the stocks, to fit him for his\r\nSunday duties.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the fairs, deeds of violence were not unknown.  At a\r\nhouse on the north side of the Market-place, which was formerly the\r\n“Queen’s Head” inn, but is now occupied by a veterinary surgeon, while\r\nalterations were being made, two skeletons were found under the bricks of\r\nthe kitchen floor.  The men had doubtless been murdered for their money\r\nat fair-time, and the bodies placed there for concealment.  Of the\r\ncheating practised at the fairs I can give a sample or two.  It is\r\nrecorded, I believe, that the late Dr. Dealtry, Archdeacon of Calcutta,\r\npreaching on the different ideas of honesty or fraud, gave point to his\r\nargument by a humorous illustration.  “For instance,” he said, “my worthy\r\nfriend, who occupies the reading desk beneath me, would see no dishonesty\r\nin misrepresenting the qualities of a horse he wished to sell, even to\r\nhis dearest friend.”  And honesty has by no means always been deemed the\r\nbest policy in the streets of Horncastle.  Edmund Yates, in his personal\r\n“Recollections,” relates that he was dining with the Lord Chief Justice,\r\nSir Alexander Cockburn, when his host told the following story:—A man saw\r\na handsome-looking horse at Horncastle Fair, and was astonished at the\r\nlow price asked for it.  After some chaffering, he bought it, taking it\r\nwithout a warranty.  Having paid his money, he gave an extra five\r\nshillings to the groom, and asked what was the matter with the horse that\r\nhe was sold so cheap.  After some hesitation, the man said that the horse\r\nwas a perfect animal, but for two faults.  “Two faults,” said the buyer,\r\n“then tell me one of them.”  “One,” said the groom, “is, that when you\r\nturn him out, in a field, he is very hard to catch.”  “That,” said the\r\nbuyer, “does not matter to me, as I never turn my horses out.  Now for\r\nthe other fault.”  “The other,” said the groom, scratching his head and\r\nlooking sly, “the other is, that when you’ve caught him he’s not worth a\r\nrap.”\r\n\r\nAnother story is as follows:—Some yeans ago a Lincolnshire clergyman,\r\nadvanced in years, had an old horse which had run in his antiquated\r\ncarriage from being four years old, till he was fourteen or fifteen.  He\r\nwould still have satisfied his master, but that he acquired a very bad\r\nhabit, to which, like other old animals not four-legged, he obstinately\r\nadhered.  He would jump over the dyke (the locality being in the marshes)\r\ninto a neighbour’s field.  The said neighbour complained of this so often\r\nthat the pastor decided to sell.  The old coachman took the horse to\r\nHorncastle Fair and sold him for £26.  The old gentleman and his coachman\r\nthen looked about the fair for another that would suit them.  They\r\npresently saw a horse of the same size and style as the old favourite\r\njust sold, but with shorter mane and tail, and lacking the star on the\r\nforehead which marked the old horse.  They asked, the price, and were\r\ntold it was £40.  After much haggling the horse was bought for £35, and\r\nhis reverence drove home with the new purchase.  After tea his wife said,\r\n“Well, so you have not sold?”  “Oh, yes,” he replied, “we have, and have\r\ngot a younger and more spirited animal, very like the old sinner, but\r\nwith shorter mane and tail, and no star on his forehead.”  “Well,” said\r\nthe wife, “I think you were taken in, for the new horse is already, like\r\nthe old one, grazing in neighbour Brown’s field”; and there, sure enough,\r\nhe was.  The dealer had docked the tail, trimmed the mane, and dyed the\r\nwhite star brown; and had “gingered” the old horse till he played up like\r\na colt.  His reverence, in short, had been “sold,” and the old sinner had\r\nbeen returned on his hands with the loss of £10.\r\n\r\nMy third story relates to a former Vicar of Horncastle, Dr. Loddington,\r\nwho died in 1724, but whose name survives on one of the church bells,\r\ncast during his incumbency.\r\n\r\nWe are told, on authority, {183} that at one time all kinds of traffic\r\nwent on within St. Paul’s Cathedral, and its precincts, in London.  It\r\nwas the common lounge of gallants and their female friends; and even a\r\nhorse might be bought there; and such a transaction actually did take\r\nplace in St. Mary’s Church, Horncastle.  The Vicar had a chestnut mare\r\nwhich he wished to sell.  Two dealers at the fair bid for her up to £35,\r\nwhich he refused to take.  Sitting together at breakfast on the Sunday\r\nmorning at their inn, Brown said to Robinson, “I bet you a bottle of wine\r\nI buy that mare of the Vicar’s.”  “Done,” said Robinson.  They both went\r\nto church, which was more than many dealers do nowadays.  Brown took his\r\nseat just under the pulpit.  Robinson, not knowing this, sat near the\r\nporch, intending to intercept the Vicar as he went out.  The sermon\r\nended, Brown waited till the Vicar descended from the pulpit; as he\r\nreached the bottom step of the stairs, Brown went to him and said, “That\r\nwas a good sermon, but your reverence has not yet sold that mare; the\r\nfair is over, and I am leaving in the afternoon.  Won’t you take the £35?\r\nYou’ll never get a better bid.”  The Vicar thought for a moment, and then\r\nwhispered, “You may have her.”  He went out, was met in the porch by\r\nRobinson, who found that he was too late, and owed Brown a bottle of\r\nwine; his only consolation was that he resolved himself to drink the\r\nbetter half of it.\r\n\r\nAt these fairs good bargains may be made by one who has an eye to the\r\npoints of a horse, and can use his opportunities.  The writer knew a\r\ncurate in the south-west of Lincolnshire, whose stipend was £50 a year.\r\nHe came regularly every year, for many years, to the August fair.  His\r\nfirst purchase was a young horse, for which be gave the whole of his\r\nyear’s stipend, £50.  He kept it a year, and hunted it.  I have ridden\r\nwith him, when mounted on that horse, with the Belvoir hounds, and the\r\nnext year he sold it for £300, a pretty good percentage on the original\r\noutlay.  A cousin of the writer picked out a young horse from a number\r\nand gave £24 for it; he afterwards refused to take £300 for it, offered\r\nby “Lord Henry”; but he lent it to his lordship occasionally.  Another,\r\nwhich he bought cheap, and for which he refused £400, broke its leg in\r\njumping the river Bain, in a Horncastle steeplechase and had to be shot\r\non the spot.  Both these horses I have ridden to hounds, the one a bay,\r\nthe other black.\r\n\r\nConnected with the fairs is the so-called “Statutes,” a day in May for\r\nhiring servants.  It was formerly the one general holiday in the year,\r\nbut now that the Bank Holidays have been established, the statute-day is\r\ndwindling in its proportions.  Of old all the servant girls, and all the\r\nclodhoppers from the country, used to gather in the town dressed in\r\ngalore fashion, crowding the Bull-ring.  Anyone who wanted a servant, as\r\nan old farmer once told the writer was his invariable custom, used to\r\nwalk into the crowd and hire the first lass against whom he stumbled.\r\nThe “fasten-penny,” a silver coin, was then given, and the bargain was\r\nthen struck.  Wild beast shows, and enormities such as lambs with two\r\nheads or a dozen legs, and other attractions, were provided, and the day\r\nended with music and dancing at the different inns in the town; some of\r\nthe proceedings having after-effects not desirable.  At the present time,\r\nwhen there is more regard for our domestic servants and their characters,\r\nand cheap postage prevails, this mode of haphazard engagement has nearly\r\ndied out, and the Statute will soon be a thing of the past.  It was first\r\nenacted by Ed. III. in 1351; again by 13th Richard II., and, in later\r\ntimes, was held under “a precept” from the Chief Constable of the\r\nDivision.  To those who wish to read a humorous and graphic description\r\nof the doings on this day, in comparatively recent times, I would\r\nrecommend the poem “Neddy and Sally; or, The Statute Day,” by John Brown,\r\n“the Horncastle Laureate, {184} of which I can here give only the opening\r\nlines, which breathe of the spirit inspiring the occasion.\r\n\r\n    “Cum, Sall!  It’s time we started now,\r\n       Yon’s Farmer Haycock’s lasses reddy,\r\n    An’ maister says he’ll milk the cow.”\r\n       “He didn’t say soa, did he, Neddy?”\r\n\r\n    “Yees! that he did; soa make thee haste;\r\n       An’ get thee sen made smart an’ pritty;\r\n    Wi’ yaller ribbon round thee waist;\r\n       The same as owd Squire Lowden’s Kitty.\r\n\r\n    And I’ll goa fetch my sister Bess;\r\n       I’m sartin sewer she’s up an’ ready;\r\n    Cum! gie’s a buss!  Thou can’t do less.”\r\n       Says Sally, “Noa, thou musn’t, Neddy.”\r\n\r\nThere have not been wanting, in this old town, some eccentric characters,\r\nwhose doings have been peculiar, and have been traditionally preserved\r\nfor the entertainment of a rising generation.  Of these two or three may\r\nbe recorded here, but for obvious reasons I avoid mentioning names.  One\r\nindividual, exulting in his strength, undertook, for a wager, some time\r\nin the thirties, to drag a dung cart from Lincoln to Horncastle, a\r\ndistance of 21 miles, and successfully accomplished the feat in eight\r\nhours, but he is said to have suffered from hæmorrhage for the rest of\r\nhis days.  Another man made a bet that he would start from Lincoln on\r\nhorseback when the moon rose there, and would have his horse in his own\r\nstable at Horncastle before the moon had risen there.  Lincoln being on a\r\nhill, the moon would be seen earlier there than at Horncastle, which lay\r\nin a hollow.  As he galloped along he is said to have shouted, “Now me,\r\nnow moon,” as the chances seemed at intervals for or against the one or\r\nthe other.  He just, however, missed the success which he might have\r\nachieved, as he had to pull up, late in the evening, at the toll-bar on\r\nthe Lincoln road, about a mile from Horncastle, the toll-bar keeper being\r\nin bed; and this slight delay caused his failure, for, as he opened his\r\nstable door, he saw the moon shining in a bucket of water which was\r\nstanding ready for his steed.  The writer is informed that one, if not\r\nboth, of these individuals was considered to be a little “short” of the\r\nfull modicum of brains.  Another person, still resident in the town,\r\nremembers the burning, in the street, of the effigies of Bayock and\r\nDemont, two of the witnesses in the trial of Queen Caroline, in 1820.\r\nThey were Italians.  There were great rejoicings and illuminations, in\r\nLondon and throughout the country, on Her Majesty’s acquittal; and this\r\nwas the demonstration of Horncastrians.  An old song was popular at the\r\ntime, beginning thus:\r\n\r\n    False witnesses from Italy, they came to London town;\r\n    And all they had against her was to keep her from the crown.\r\n\r\nWharrie, a shoemaker in the town, was inspired to preach a sermon in the\r\nBull-ring, from a cart, denouncing the trial.  This sermon was printed,\r\nand a copy was long in the possession of my informant.\r\n\r\nA character of a higher type than those yet named, was the late\r\nproprietor and manager of “The Bull” hostel, at which we are now supposed\r\nto be staying, Mr. Clement James Caswell, a genial, generous, and\r\ncultivated gentleman.  He came of an old and highly respectable stock\r\nlocated in the county of Herts., his father being for many years landlord\r\nof “The George,” at Barnet, a stage on the Great North road, through\r\nwhich, in the old coaching days, scores of coaches passed daily.  He was\r\na coach proprietor, and handled the ribbons himself.  The son was\r\neducated at the Spalding Grammar School, and acquired antiquarian, tastes\r\nwhile yet a boy.  After having held some important public offices in that\r\ntown, and then managing some mills at Aswardby, he bought the Bull at\r\nHorncastle.  Though the inn had previously held a high position, he still\r\nfurther raised its character; and his spare time was devoted to reading,\r\nand research of various kinds.  He had a very valuable collection of\r\ncoins, the result of many years of careful selection.  His garden, just\r\nout of the town, had an observatory, furnished with telescope, books, and\r\nother appliances for amusement and relaxation.  He supplied the\r\nillustrations for a book entitled “In Tennyson Land,” by J. Cuming\r\nWalters, published in 1890.  He was a member of the Architectural Society\r\nof Lincolnshire, Notts. and Leicestershire; a member of the Spalding\r\nGentlemen’s Society, one of the oldest antiquarian societies in the\r\nkingdom; and he was continually corresponding, in various directions, on\r\nsubjects of antiquarian interest.  He had a valuable library of books\r\nbearing on these and kindred studies, and indicating the wide extent of\r\nhis reading.  Especially, perhaps, as a Tennysonian expert, he was\r\nconsulted by almost everyone who has written on that subject, as in the\r\ncase already named, and in Napier’s “Homes and Haunts of Tennyson.”  It\r\nwas a treat to get a quiet, genial hour with him, when he would run on\r\nwith a stream of informing converse, but on few themes did he warm up\r\nwith so much inspiration as that of the late Laureate, witness these\r\nlines of his own composition:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMERSBY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Bright Somersby! the sometime summer haunt\r\n    Of Norsemen and of Dane, whose bards mayhap\r\n    Foretold—a nest of nightingales would come,\r\n    And trill their songs in shades of Holy Well;\r\n    Prophetic bards; for we have lived to see\r\n    Within your bounds a large-limbed race of men;\r\n    A long-lived race, and brimming o’er with song,\r\n    From lays of ancient Greece, and Roman eld,\r\n    To songs of Arthur’s knights, and England’s prime,\r\n    And modern verse, in graceful sonnet sung.\r\n    Each of the brood was clothed upon with song;\r\n    Yet some had stronger pinions than the rest;\r\n    And one there was, who for thy fame will long\r\n    Send pilgrims to thy cross in loving quest.\r\n\r\nMr. Caswell passed away in August, 1896, much valued and much missed by\r\nmany friends who knew his worth.\r\n\r\nA trace of the Saxon still survives in the name of a field, to the south\r\nof the town, and lately given to the town by the Lord of the Manor, which\r\nis called “The Wong.”  This is an old Saxon word for “meadow.”  In the\r\n“Ancient English Romance of Havelok the Dane” (Early English Text\r\nSociety, London, 1868), we find in line 397, “Casteles and tunes, wodes\r\nand wonges,” _i.e._ castles and villages, woods and fields.  In Stamford\r\na back street, formerly in the suburbs, retains the name Wong street.  In\r\nNorth Yorkshire is a hamlet named Wet-wang, and in our own neighbourhood,\r\nat Halton Holegate, near Spilsby, there is land called “The Wongs.”\r\n\r\nHorncastle was the Roman station Banovallum, or fortress on the Bane,\r\nmentioned by the historian Ravennas.  Fragments of the massive walls of\r\nthe old castrum, or fort, can be distinctly traced by those who know\r\nwhere to look for them; but they need looking for, since, for the most\r\npart, they are hidden in the back premises of shops or residences, which\r\nface the street.  Briefly stated, the western wall runs along the western\r\nboundary of the churchyard of the Parish Church, and may there be seen,\r\nas well as a fragment of it in a yard at the end of the road which passes\r\nnorth of the churchyard.  It continued northward to within a few yards of\r\nthe bridge over the northern branch of the canal.  The southern wall runs\r\nalmost parallel with the south branch of the canal, portions being\r\nvisible at the back of the Grammar School, and at a corner of St. Mary’s\r\nsquare close to the churchyard.  This runs eastward through various back\r\npremises, and may best be seen in a coalyard near the canal.  At that\r\npoint the eastern wall begins, and runs northward, passing under some\r\nhouses, and yards, and under the High street, the most north-easterly\r\npoint being found in a small yard at the back of the shop of Messrs.\r\nCarlton and Sons, Chemists, adjoining Dog Kennel yard; so called because\r\nLord Fitz-Williams’ hounds were kennelled there when he hunted the South\r\nWold country nearly a century ago.  The northern wall runs through back\r\npremises an the north of the Market place, and at the back of Mr.\r\nOverton’s and Mr. Lunn’s premises.  In the fields on the south-west of\r\nthe town, and beyond the south branch of the canal was formerly a maze,\r\nsuch as have been found at other Roman stations. {188a}  This was named\r\n“Julian’s Bower,” and thought by Stukeley to be Roman, but the late\r\nBishop Suffragan, E. Trollope, in a Paper read at Horncastle, June 3rd,\r\n1858, {188b} pronounced it to be mediæval.  In the Roman maze the youths\r\nplayed at “Tory Town;” and as this game was first taught by Ascanius,\r\ncalled also Iulus, the son of Æneas, from him it acquired the name\r\n“Julian.” {188c}  At the west end of the town, in the angle between the\r\nroads leading to the railway station and Edlington, is a site called\r\nMaypole Hill.  Here the boys and girls used to march in procession on May\r\nday, bearing flowers, “with wands called May-gads in their hands,\r\nenwreathed with cowslips,” and dance around the Maypole; a relic, as some\r\nauthorities say, of the Roman Festival of the Floralia; {188d} others say\r\nit was a practice introduced by the Danish Vikings, with whom the\r\nMaypole, often a fixture, represented a sacred tree, around which\r\ncouncils were held and human sacrifices were offered. {188e}  These games\r\nin Horncastle, Mr. Weir, in his History, {188f} says, were given up about\r\n1780.  Several Roman roads converge at Horncastle.  The old Roman castle,\r\nsays Leland, {188g} quoting an old mysterious chronicle, “Vortimer caused\r\nto be beten doune; and never sin was re-fortified; the which castel was\r\nfirst enstrengthened by Hors, Hengist’s brother.”  The modern name,\r\nHorncastle, is the Saxon Hyrn-Ceaster, or “castle in a corner,” as it is\r\nplaced in the angle formed by the two streams, the Bain and the Waring.\r\nThe word Hyrn, or Hurn, occurs at other places in the county,\r\nrepresenting an angle or promontory, as well as a recess or bay.\r\n\r\nTo come to a later period, it appears, from Domesday Book, that\r\nHorncastle, at one time, had been the property of Editha, the wife of\r\nEdward the Confessor, but at the date of that Survey it belonged to King\r\nWilliam himself.  In the reign of Stephen it was the demesne of Adelias\r\nde Cundi, daughter and heiress of William de Chesney, Lord of Caenby and\r\nGlentham.  On her death it reverted to the Crown, and the manor was\r\nbestowed by Henry II. on Gerbald de Escald, a Fleming.  He was succeeded\r\nby his grandson, Gerard de Rhodes, during whose minority it was held, in\r\ntrust, by Ranulph, Earl of Chester.  Gerard was succeeded by his son\r\nRalph de Rhodes, who, in the reign of Henry III., sold the manor to\r\nWalter Mauclerke, Bishop of Carlisle, and Treasurer of the Exchequer.\r\nThis was afterwards confirmed by the King, who conferred upon the Bishop,\r\nby a succession of charters, various privilege’s and immunities, which\r\ntended to the growth and prosperity of the town.  Among other powers\r\nbestowed upon the Bishop was the right to seize and try felons, and on\r\nthe south-east of the parish there is a place, still called “Hangman’s\r\nCorner,” where criminals were executed by his order.  The bishops long\r\nhad a palace, their chief Residence, in Horncastle, which was situated at\r\nthe rear of the Black Horse inn and the premises of Mr. Lunn, grocer.  It\r\nwas demolished in 1770.  The manor continued their property till the\r\nreign of Ed. VI., when Bishop Aldrich sold it to Edward, Lord Clinton,\r\nwho, however, was compelled by Queen Mary to re-convey it to the See of\r\nCarlisle, and the bishops continued lords of the manor till 1856, when it\r\nwas transferred to the Bishop of Lincoln with the patronage of the\r\nbenefice.  The lease of this manor was held by Queen Elizabeth and her\r\nsuccessor, James I., who assigned it to Sir Henry Clinton.  This lease\r\nwas held for nearly a century by Sir Joseph Banks and his family,\r\nultimately passing to James Banks Stanhope, Esq., late of Revesby.\r\n\r\nOf the Church not a great deal need be said.  It was thoroughly restored\r\nin 1864, at a cost of £4,000, and is now in an excellent condition.  The\r\neast window is almost a copy, on an enlarged scale, of the east window of\r\nHaltham church, in this neighbourhood.  It exhibits, in stained glass,\r\nevents in the life of the Saviour; beneath it is a carved reredos of Caen\r\nstone, the central subject of the sculpture being the agony in the\r\ngarden, with figures of the four Evangelists, two on each side.  The\r\norgan is a costly and very fine instrument, mainly due to the liberality\r\nof the late Henry James Fielding.  In the north aisle is a brass of Sir\r\nLionel Dymoke, in armour, kneeling on a cushion; on either side are two\r\nshields, and beneath, figures of two sons and three daughters.  His hands\r\nare placed together as in prayer, and from his left elbow issues a\r\nscroll, with the inscription, “Sc’ta trinitas unus deus miserere nob.”\r\nThe shields display the arms of Dymoke, Waterton, Marmyon, Hebden, and\r\nHaydon.  The antiquarian, Gervase Holles, gives, from the Harleian MSS.,\r\nseveral other inscriptions, which no longer exist, but which are found in\r\nWeir’s “History of Horncastle.”  Near this, attached to the wall above\r\nthe north-east door, and on each side of the arch between the aisle and\r\nchancel, are some rude weapons of war in the shape of long knives, or\r\nscythes, supposed to have been used at the Winceby fight, when it is\r\nknown that the troops of the Royalists were very badly armed. {190}\r\nThere are several memorial tablets on the walls.  In the floor of the\r\nsouth aisle, towards the east end, is the tombstone of Sarah Sellwood,\r\nwife of Henry Sellwood, Esq., and mother-in-law of Lord Tennyson, the\r\nPoet Laureate.  She died Sept. 30th, 1816.  The roof is of Spanish\r\nchestnut, which was formerly completely hidden by a flat plaster ceiling.\r\nOn the north wall of the chancel, over the north-east door, is a tablet\r\nto the memory of Sir Ingram Hopton, who, after unhorsing Cromwell, was\r\nhimself slain at the battle of Winceby, the date of which is there\r\nwrongly given as “October 6th, A.D. 1643,” whereas the fight really took\r\nplace on October 11th.  Cromwell is also there designated as “the arch\r\nrebel,” whereas at that time he was only a colonel; but, to quote two\r\nwords from the Latin inscription, he was then an instance of “celata\r\nvirtus,” his future greatness not yet known; and the epitaph, of course\r\ninscribed afterwards, is a slight solecism, and we may here venture to\r\nmake the remark that this monument is now itself a further instance of\r\n“celata virtus,” for it is placed in a position where no light falls upon\r\nit, and the writer actually looked at it recently without recognising\r\nwhat it was.  On the wall between nave and chancel, on the south side, is\r\na small stone bearing the names of Thomas Gibson, Vicar; John Hamerton\r\nand John Goake, Church-wardens, 1675.  Walker, in his “Sufferings of the\r\nClergy” (1714), gives an account of this Vicar, which is here abridged.\r\nBorn at Keswick, educated at Queen’s College, Oxford, he was appointed\r\nMaster of the Free School at Carlisle; thence to that of Newcastle, and\r\npreferred by the Bishop of Carlisle to the Vicarage in 1634.  In\r\nconsequence of a sermon preached by him, at the election for convocation,\r\nhe was seized, in 1643, and carried as a prisoner to Hull.  Being\r\nreleased, after four months’ detention, and returning to Horncastle, he\r\nwas charged with teaching “Ormanism” (Arminianism), and committed to the\r\n“county jayl” at Lincoln, and a Presbyterian minister appointed in his\r\nstead at Horncastle.  In 1644, Colonel King, the governor of Boston,\r\nordered a party of horse to seize him (he apparently having been released\r\nfrom Lincoln) and to plunder his house, but an old pupil, Lieut.-Colonel\r\nJohn Lillburn, interceded for him with his superior officer, Col. King,\r\nand the order was revoked; on Lillburn, however, presently going to\r\nLondon, the order was repeated, and Mr. Gibson was made prisoner, his\r\nhouse plundered, and his saddle horse, draught horses, and oxen, taken\r\nfrom him.  He was imprisoned at Boston, then in Lincoln, and in\r\n“Tattors-Hall-Castle, where he had very ill usage for 17 weeks.”  He was\r\nsequestered from his living, and an “intruder,” one Obadiah How, put in\r\ncharge.  He was now accused by the Puritans of obeying the orders of the\r\nChurch, defending episcopacy, refusing “the covenant,” etc.  He retired\r\n“to a mean house,” about a mile from Horncastle (supposed to be at Nether\r\n(Low) Toynton), where he and his family “lived but poorly for two years,\r\nteaching a few pupils.”  He was then made master of the free school at\r\nNewark; two years later removed to the school at Sleaford, being\r\npresented by Lady Carr.  There he lived until the Restoration, and then\r\nresumed his Vicarage at Horncastle, until he died, in 1674, aged 84.  “He\r\nwas a grave and Venerable Person, of a Sober and Regular conversation,\r\nand so studious of peace, that when any Differences arose in his Parish,\r\nhe never rested till he had Composed them.  He had likewise so well\r\nPrincipled his Parish, that of 250 families in it, he left but one of\r\nthem Dissenters at his Death.” {192a}  There is an inscription painted on\r\nthe south wall of the chancel, with gilt and coloured border,\r\ncommemorative of this worthy Vicar, which truly states that he “lived in\r\ntimes when truth to the Church and loyalty to the King met with\r\npunishment due only to the worst of crimes.”  The church of St. Mary is\r\nnot named in Domesday Book, and probably at that time no church existed\r\non this site.  But in the Record of an Inquisition post mortem, taken at\r\nHorncastle, Jan. 21st, 1384–5, Richard II., it is stated that the King\r\ngave to a certain Gilbert, Prior of Wyllesforth, and his successors, two\r\nmessuages, &c., and the site of the Chapel of St. Lawrence, with\r\nappurtenances, in Horncastre, on condition that “they find a fit chaplain\r\nto celebrate mass in the chapel aforesaid, three days in every week.”\r\n{192b}  This chapel probably stood in or near the street running\r\nnorthward out of the Market place, and called St. Lawrence street, near\r\nwhich bodies have been exhumed at different times.  When the clump of\r\nshops were cleared away in 1892, to make the present Market place,\r\nthrough the liberality of the late Right Hon. Edward Stanhope, several\r\nlarge fragments of Norman pillars were found, which probably once\r\nbelonged to the old Norman chapel. {193c}  St. Lawrence is the Patron\r\nSaint of Horncastle; and as he was martyred on a brander, or gridiron,\r\nthe arms of the town are a Gridiron.  The “canting” device of a castle on\r\na horn has no very ancient authority.  The “pancake bell” is rung on\r\nShrove Tuesday, at 10 a.m.; the Curfew at 8 p.m. from Oct. 11 to April 6,\r\nexcept Saturdays at 7 p.m., and omitting from St. Thomas’s Day to Plough\r\nMonday.  The Grammar School bell used to be rung, and the writer has\r\noften assisted, as a boy, in ringing it at 7 a.m.; but it has been given\r\nup of late years, as the governors of the school declined to pay far it.\r\n\r\nIn one of the Parish Registers appears the following entry:—“On the Vth\r\ndaie of October one thousand six hundred & three, in the first yeare of\r\nour Souvraine Lord King James was holden in Horncastle Church a solemn\r\nfast from eight in the morning until foure a clock in the afternoone by\r\nfive preachers, vidiz. Mr. Hollinhedge, vicar of Horncastle, Mr. Turner\r\nof Edlington, Mr. Downe of Lusbye, Mr. Phillipe of Salmonbye, Mr. Tanzey\r\nof Hagworthingha’, occasioned by a general and most feareful plague yt\r\nyeare in sundrie places of this land, but especially upon the cytie of\r\nLondon.  Pr. me Clementen Whitelock.”  A Record at the Rolls Court states\r\nthat Horncastle Church was resorted to by a robber for the purpose of\r\nSanctuary, as follows:—“22 August 1229.  The King (at Windsor) commands\r\nthe Sheriff of Lincolnshire (Radulphus filius Reginald) to send two\r\ncoroners of the county to see that a robber who keeps himself in the\r\nChurch of Horncastle, abjures the kingdom.” {193}  Among some MS. Records\r\nin the possession of Mr. John Overton, I find it stated that in December,\r\n1812, the vestry room was broken open and robbed of all the money, and\r\nother valuables; and that £50 reward was offered by the Vestry for the\r\ndiscovery of the culprits.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Manor of Horncastle was at more than one period Royal\r\nproperty, it has only once, so far as we know, been visited by Royalty.\r\nLeland states that “in the year of our Lord 1406, on the 12th of\r\nSeptember, on Saturday at 6 o’clock, Henry (IV.) by the grace of God,\r\nKing of England, came from the town of Horncastle, to the Abbey of\r\nBardney, with a great and honourable company on horseback”; and that “the\r\nAbbot and Convent of the aforesaid Monastery went out to meet him in\r\nprocession at the outer gates.” {194a}  We have no further known record\r\nof this visit; but as Henry IV. was the son of John of Gaunt, and born at\r\nBolingbroke, we may assume that he passed through Horncastle on his way\r\nfrom Bolingbroke to the palace of his father at Lincoln, and that John of\r\nGaunt’s stables, still standing at the present day in the High street of\r\nthat city, sheltered the steeds of the company at the end of their\r\njourney.  Doubtless he adjourned a night, if not more, at Horncastle, and\r\nthe loyal old town, probably headed by the Champion Dymoke of the day,\r\nwould give him as hearty a welcome as that which awaited him from the\r\nabbot and monks at Bardney.\r\n\r\nTwo or three more short remarks may be made about Horncastle.  When Sir\r\nIngram Hopton, whose tablet we have mentioned as being in the church, was\r\nslain at Winceby, the body, by Cromwell’s order, was brought to\r\nHorncastle for burial.  It was placed in the house, or, rather, a\r\nprevious house on the same site, in West Street, now named Cromwell\r\nHouse; and it is said, on what authority we do not know, that Cromwell\r\nhimself came to Horncastle, that he might personally instruct the\r\nchurchwarden, Mr. Hamerton, that the opponent, whom he pronounced to be\r\n“a brave gentleman,” should be properly honoured in his obsequies. {194b}\r\n\r\nA house at the south-west corner of the market place, where Mr. R. W.\r\nClitherow, solicitor, now lives, was formerly a public-house, but was\r\nburnt down and the present one erected.  At this house, then occupied by\r\nMr. Sellwood, solicitor, Sir John Franklin visited, and was entertained\r\nat a public dinner, a few days before he set out, in 1844, on his final\r\nArctic expedition; and the writer remembers his father going to attend\r\nthis dinner.\r\n\r\nWe have said that, 100 years ago, almost every house was thatched.  A\r\nrecord in Mr. Overton’s possession states that the two first slate-roofed\r\nhouses in the town were one built by Mr. Storr, a gardener, afterwards\r\noccupied by Mrs. L’Oste, widow of the Rev. C. L’Oste, rector of Langton,\r\nand now occupied by Dr. Howes; and the house of Mr. Titus Overton, now\r\noccupied by Mr. John Overton, being erected in 1793.\r\n\r\nHaving completed our perambulations of the town, let us betake ourselves\r\nonce more to the country.  We remount the hill, which we descended on\r\nleaving Thimbleby for Horncastle, but by a different road, viz., one\r\nrunning due west.  Half way up the ascent of this, the westernmost spur\r\nof the chalky Wolds, we have two roads, either of which would bring us to\r\nWoodhall Spa, almost equi-distant by either; but that is not, as yet, our\r\ndestination.  We continue the ascent, due westward.  The summit reached,\r\nwe have a wide prospect before us.  To the left, on a clear day, Boston\r\nStump is visible, the Tower on the Moor rises above the woods, beyond\r\nthat Tattershall castle and church; in the dim distance the graceful\r\nspire of Heckington points, like a needle, to the sky.  Straight in front\r\nof us woods on woods band and bar the prospect, relieved by the spires of\r\nOld Woodhall and Horsington.  To the right, the horizon is crowned by the\r\nalmost pyramidal shape of Lincoln Minster, the seeing eye also detecting\r\nthe lesser pyramid of the Chapter House, other spires, with the factory\r\nchimneys of the now busy city, more than its old prosperity being\r\nrevived.  Further to the right the plantations of Fillingham Castle, some\r\nmiles beyond Lincoln, on the “Spital road,” fringe the view.  Truly, it\r\nis a wide-ranging outlook, embracing little short of 30 miles, with many\r\na village and hamlet, buried and unseen, in its entourage of wood.\r\nImmediately in the near front is Langton mill, a conspicuous object,\r\nwhich I have distinguished from the top of Lincoln Minster itself.\r\nHalf-a-mile farther lies the village of Langton, one of three of the same\r\nname in the neighbourhood—one near Spilsby, one near Wragby, and this “by\r\nHorncastle.”  As to the meaning of the name Langton, Dr. Oliver refers\r\nthe first syllable to the British “Lan” (Welsh Llan), meaning “place of\r\nworship,” and so corresponding to Kirkby, or Kirkstead.  In this\r\nparticular case, however, the ordinary meaning of “Lang,” or “long,”\r\nwould be specially applicable, since the village has evidently at one\r\ntime been larger than at present, and the parish extended, some six\r\nmiles, to the Witham, until, quite recently, the distant portion was\r\nincluded in Woodhall Spa.  Here again we had, until recent years, in the\r\nrectory, another moated residence, standing almost on an island, being\r\nsurrounded by water except for the space of the churchyard and the width\r\nof a drive to the house.  The moat was drained for sanitary reasons about\r\n50 yeans ago, to the regret of many, since, as has been mentioned in a\r\nprevious chapter (Chapter VI.), it contained an abundance of large pike,\r\nand other fish, from which the lake at Sturton Hall was stocked.  The\r\nQueen was the lady of the manor until, in 1860, much Crown property was\r\nsold in this neighbourhood, and the manor and most of the land in the\r\nparish, except the glebe, was bought by the Coates family, who have a\r\nsubstantial residence here.\r\n\r\nIn three fields at the west end of the village are traces of ponds,\r\nmounds, and hollows, indicating large buildings existing at one time.\r\nAnd we have sundry records of men of rank who have owned land, and\r\nprobably resided, in the parish.  Dugdale {196a} tells us that this\r\n“town” was given by the Conqueror to the then powerful Bishop of Durham,\r\nwhose name was William de Karilepho.  He was Chief Justice of England.\r\nThis gift the Conqueror may be said to have “confirmed with an oath,” for\r\nthe charter, conveying the land, sets forth that they “shall be preserved\r\ninviolable for ever,” and concludes with an anathema on whosoever shall\r\nprofane the charter, or change anything therein, unless for the\r\nbetter:—“by the authority of the Prince of Apostles, I deprive them of\r\nthe society of the Lord, the aforesaid Pope Gregory, and the Church; and\r\nreserve them by the judgment of God, to be punished by everlasting fire\r\nwith the devil and his angels.  Amen.”  This fearful threat of Divine\r\nvengeance, however, seems to have lost its terror after a lapse of time\r\nof no very great length, since, according to the historian Banks, {196b}\r\nin the 9th year of Edward I. Philip de Marmion held the manor.\r\n\r\nThere was formerly not only Langton, but an outlying Langton-thorpe, and\r\nthis is probably referred to in Domesday Book as the “Berewick” of\r\nLangton, for it is there stated that Robert Dispenser held in this\r\nBerewick {197a} of Langton one carucate in demesne, eight soke men\r\n(tenants) with half a carucate, and four villeins with two carucates, and\r\ntwenty-four acres of meadow, and two hundred and eighty acres of wood\r\ncontaining pasturage.\r\n\r\nA powerful family of the Angevines lived here at a later period.  There\r\nis, extant among the Records of Lincoln, {197b} the Will of Robert\r\nAngevine, Gent., of Langton by Horncastle, dated 25th April, 1545, in\r\nwhich he requests that he may be buried in the church of St. Margaret; he\r\nbequeaths to his daughters, Millesancte, Grace, Jane, and Mary, “vli.\r\napiece,” the money to come out of Burnsall, Hebden, Conyseat, and Norton,\r\nin Yorkshire; to his wife Margaret “xli. a year for life out of the said\r\nlands”; and to his son William lands in Hameringham.  The family acquired\r\ntheir name thus:—Ivo Tailbois was at the head of the Aungevine troops of\r\nauxiliaries which William the Conqueror brought over with him from\r\nNormandy; and this name, in time, took the various forms of Aungelyne,\r\nAungeby, and Angevine.  There were Angevines at Whaplode, in the\r\nsouth-east of the county, in the 12th century.  There was a branch of\r\nthem at Theddlethorpe, and at Saltfleetby, in the 14th century.  The one\r\nat Langton had a brother at West Ashby.  They appear in the Visitation of\r\n1562 among the leading families of the county gentry; but in 1592 the\r\nname does not appear, and they dwindled away, and at the time of the\r\nCommonwealth are nowhere found.  The old families of Scroope and of\r\nLangton are also said to have resided here.  A member of the family of\r\nthe Dightons, who owned Stourton, Waddingworth, and other properties in\r\nthis neighbourhood, if not actually residing in Langton (although he\r\nprobably did), had an interest in the place, as, in a Will, still at\r\nLincoln, dated 15th July, 1557, having requested that he might “be buried\r\nin the quire where I die”; among other bequests, he leaves a sum of money\r\n“to the poore of Langton by Horncastle.” {198}\r\n\r\nFrom 1653 to 1656 Justice Filkin resided at Langton, and before him\r\npersons of Horncastle and the neighbourhood were frequently married, the\r\nlaw at that time recognising only civil marriages.\r\n\r\nThe church of Langton (St. Margaret’s) is a small edifice, and, until\r\nrecently, was in a very poor condition, with no pretension to\r\narchitectural beauty in any of its features.  It had been rebuilt in the\r\n18th century, at the very worst period for such work, and so badly done\r\nthat it was almost a ruin when the writer, as rector, undertook its\r\nrestoration.  Though still small, it now has several interesting\r\nfeatures.  The pulpit, reading desk and lectern have been carved by the\r\nRector, in old oak, in Jacobean style, in memory of his father, who was\r\nrector 49 years.  In the chancel there is an Aumbrey containing an\r\nancient stoup of Barnack stone, said to have formerly been the holy water\r\nvessel of Spalding Priory.  On the Communion table is a curious old alms\r\ndish of “lateen” metal; the device in the centre is the temptation by the\r\ndevil of our first parents; an inscription in old Dutch runs\r\nround,—Vreest Goedt honderhovedt syn geboedt; or, Fear God, keep his\r\ncommandments.  The font bowl is Early Norman, of Barnack stone,\r\ndiscovered by the Rector among rubbish in some back premises in\r\nHorncastle, and supposed to have been the font of the Early Norman church\r\nof St. Lawrence, once existing there; the pedestal and base are fragments\r\nfrom the ruins of Kirkstead.  In a recess, or aumbrey, behind the west\r\ndoor, is a very interesting relic, found, a few years ago, in the moat of\r\nthe old hall at Poolham, which we described in the previous chapter.  We\r\nthere mentioned the remains of an oratory, or chapel, still standing in\r\nthe south-west corner of the kitchen garden at the old Hall.  Some men\r\nwere employed in cleaning out the mud from the encircling moat, the\r\nseason being a very dry one, and the moat almost empty of water.  This\r\nhad not been done for many years, if ever before, and the mud was some\r\nfeet thick.  Below the above-named chapel ruins an object was thrown up\r\namong the mud, which the men took to be a broken seed vessel formerly\r\nbelonging to a birdcage, but as it was curiously marked, one of them took\r\nit home, and asked the writer to go and look at it.  He did so, and,\r\nseeing its antiquity, he obtained it for a trifle, and communicated with\r\nthe Society of Antiquaries, and other authorities, about it, with the\r\nresult that it was pronounced to be a mediæval chrismatory.  It was made\r\nof coarse tarra-cotta of a greyish buff colour, ornamented with patterns\r\nof squares, diamonds and crosses, with a fleur-de-lys in the centre of\r\none side, emblematic of the Trinity.  It contained in the body two square\r\nwells about an inch deep, which were originally covered with arched\r\nroofs, but one of these had been broken off.  At each end was a spout\r\nfrom the cellar.  Its total length was 7 inches; its height, including\r\nthe roof, 4 inches; breadth, 3 inches.  The use of the chrismatory was\r\nthis:—When a child was to be baptised, as it was brought into the church\r\nit was sprinkled with salt, and at baptism it was anointed with oil; and\r\nthe two cellars were intended respectively to hold the salt and oil.\r\nThis object has been exhibited on various public occasions, and has\r\nexcited much interest, as it is considered to be quite unique.  The\r\nchurch was at one time considerably larger, as, at the restoration in\r\n1891, the foundations of a north aisle were found, as well as of a tower.\r\nThe Land Revenue Records mention that, in 1553, it had “three gret bells\r\nand a sanctum bell.” {199a}  The only remaining bell bears the\r\ninscription “Anno Domini 1579, R. G.” {199b}  Considerable neglect has\r\nbeen allowed in the past, as is shown by the Archdeacon’s Visitation in\r\n1606, when the rector, Wm. Kirk, was presented “for the decay of his\r\nparsonage house”; while Wm. Newport, Thos. Goniston, and John Hodgson,\r\nguardians, were reported as “collecting monie to ye value of iijl, vjs,\r\nvijd, to buy a Co’ion Cup, and not p’viding one, and for not p’viding a\r\nsufficient bible, and a chest with two lockers and keys.”  Uriah Kirke,\r\nrector, was also presented “for suffering a barne of 3 baies to fall down\r\nbelonging to ye parsonage, and for his chauncel being in decay, and the\r\nchauncel windows all broken.”  And Charles Johnson and Augnes, widow of\r\nRobt. Thurnhill, late guardian, were reported as “selling away ye\r\nCommunion Cup belonging to ye church.”  This larger church had several\r\nwindows in the chancel, instead of the one window of the modern church,\r\nand an old document thus describes them and their colouring:—\r\n\r\n    Boreales fenestræ in Cancello.  Arg. Crosse Crusilly a lyon ramp.\r\n    double queued.  G. a lyon ram. very crowned or, Everingham.  Arg.\r\n    billetty a lyon double queued G. Rob. de Seyrt me fecit fieri.  Blue\r\n    a bend 6 mullets of 6 poynts or.  Fenestra Austualis—Barry of 6 arg.\r\n    and gules in chief, a greyhound cursant sa., collard or.—Skipworth.\r\n\r\n    In Campanili gules, a cross sarcelly arg. Beke sa. a crosse engrayled\r\n    or, Ufferd (Willoughby).\r\n\r\nThese windows were evidently fine, and indicate a connection with the\r\nparish of the ancient families Everingham, Skipwith, Deseyrt, Bec and\r\nWilloughby. {200a}  The architect for the restoration was Mr. W. Scorer,\r\nof Lincoln; and the roof of nave and chancel was painted in panels, with\r\nemblems of the Passion, and texts, by Mr. Powell, of Lincoln.  The\r\npatronage of the living was vested in Mr. Willoughby West, who also\r\nfounded and endowed a couple of Bede houses, but the family is now\r\nextinct, and by lapse the patronage is with the Bishop.\r\n\r\nA walk of a mile farther through fields, one of which is known as\r\nDog-fight, another Broad moor, and a third Pry-close, brings us to the\r\nchurch (St. Margaret also) of Old Woodhall.  The name of this field\r\n“Pry-close” would seem to be an interesting Norman survival; “Pre” is a\r\nmeadow.  Near Northampton are “the verdant meads of De la Prè.”  And this\r\nmay have been the home pasture of the old Wood-Hall.  Praie, however, is\r\nan old word meaning coarse grass, which is still to be seen in the field.\r\nThis church again, of which the writer is vicar, was in a dangerous\r\ncondition when he entered on the benefice in 1890, but was restored in\r\n1893.  It possessed an interesting feature in the spire, one, according\r\nto an old saying, of the only four spires existing on this, the eastern,\r\nside of the river Witham; that of Louth being the chief, and one of the\r\nfinest in the kingdom, which took 15 years in building; that of South\r\nSomercotes being a third; and that of Linwood being a fourth, of which\r\nGough, in his additions to Camden’s “Britannia,” (vol. ii., p. 267), says\r\nit “is the only one to be seen in a round of 59 parishes hereabouts.”\r\n{200b}  The spire of Woodhall is a modest imitation of that of Louth,\r\nhaving flying buttresses.  Half-way up it is encircled by a battlemented\r\ncorona.  Its structure is peculiar, as it rests entirely and solely on\r\ntwo buttresses on each side of the west door.  It dates from the 14th\r\ncentury.  The body of the church is modern, being rebuilt in the worst\r\nstyle in 1807, partly of brick and partly of stone, the roof throughout\r\nbeing of one elevation, without any distinction between nave and chancel.\r\nAt the restoration, the Vicar, as at Langton, carved the pulpit,\r\nreading-desk, font cover, and desk for Communion table, in memory of his\r\nfather, who was 50 years vicar.  The font was formerly in the little\r\nchapel, or oratory, in the garden at Poolham Hall, previously referred\r\nto, and left there neglected.  It is here restored to its original sacred\r\npurpose, and is supported by four handsome columns of serpentine, from\r\nthe Lizard quarries, Cornwall, the gift of the Rev. J. A. Penny, vicar of\r\nWispington.  The church has two bells.  Further details of Woodhall were\r\ngiven in a previous chapter, in describing the old moated Wood-Hall.  It\r\nwas at the farm close by the church that a well (also previously\r\nmentioned) was sunk to a depth of 33 feet, which tapped a saline spring,\r\nresembling, it was said, the Woodhall Spa water, but which soon lost its\r\nsalt taste from the inrush of fresh water. {201}  Beside a pond just\r\noutside the churchyard there is a very large ice-borne boulder, measuring\r\nabout 4½ feet in length, 4 feet in width, and 1½ feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nIn an old charter “dated at Edlington on Wednesday next after the feast\r\nof St. Michael, 1285,” by which William, son of William de Wvspington,\r\ngrants to William Hardigrey of Edlington, clerk, certain properties, one\r\nof the witnesses is Aluered de Wodhalle, along with several others.  This\r\nwould probably be a descendant of Alured of Lincoln, who, in Domesday\r\nBook, is said to be possessed of 51 lordships in Lincolnshire, besides\r\nproperty in other counties.  The last descendant died without male issue,\r\n48 Henry III., leaving his three sisters his next heirs, and so the name\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nWe now retrace our steps as far as Langton mill, and there taking the\r\nroad which branches off to the right, southward, we soon arrive at\r\nThornton.  The church, dedicated to St. Wilfrid (Archbishop A.D. 709),\r\nwhich replaced a mean structure, built about 1730 in the worst of styles,\r\nwith flat plaster ceiling and wooden window frames with large square\r\npanes of glass, was entirely rebuilt in the Perpendicular style, and\r\nthoroughly well done, in 1889–90, by Canon J. Clare Hudson, vicar, and\r\nthe leading parishioners, at a cost of £1,000.  The only objects of any\r\nantiquarian interest are some quaint wrought-iron double crosses affixed\r\nto the north and south walls of the nave, having eight iron hat pegs on\r\neach.  The font is modern, its bowl octagonal, with the monogram I.H.S.\r\nand other devices on alternate sides.  In the chancel are modern frescoes\r\nexecuted by Miss Alice Erskine, an amateur artist of much taste.  The\r\nsubject on the north wall is the visit of the Magi to the Infant Saviour,\r\nwhile on the wall to the south of the east window are representatives of\r\nthe Archangels St. Michael and St. Gabriel.  Gifts of handsome brass\r\ncandlesticks for the Holy Table, and service books have recently been\r\nmade by H. R. Elmhirst, Esq., and Mrs. Elmhirst.  The Communion table is\r\nof Indian teakwood.  We may here observe that the Records at Lincoln shew\r\nthat there were rectors in this parish (though now a vicarage) in 1232\r\nand downwards, and a list of the incumbents from that date to the present\r\ntime has been compiled by Canon Hudson, and may be seen in the parish\r\nchest.  The Parish Registers date from 1561.  Among the gentry mentioned\r\nin the Registers as residents in the parish are several members of the\r\nvery old county family of Maddison, who intermarried with the Dymokes.\r\nIn digging in the churchyard on the north-west of the old church, the\r\nbase of the west tower of the pre-Reformation church was found, which was\r\nsaid also to have had two aisles.  In the churchyard is a tombstone\r\ncommemorative of Penelope Gunnis, who died in 1826, at the advanced age\r\nof 107 years.  The western portions of this parish, which stretches from\r\nwithin 150 yards of St. Mary’s Church, Horncastle, to within 100 yards of\r\nthe Witham at Kirkstead wharf, are now included in the Civil parish of\r\nWoodhall Spa.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of the Conqueror the powerful Robert Despenser had in this\r\nparish eighty acres of meadow land, three hundred and fifty acres of\r\nwood, and two mills, with sokemen, velleins, and bordars; other land,\r\nwith dependents, being owned by Gozelin, a vassal of Alured of Lincoln,\r\nnamed above in connection with Woodhall.  The Champion Dymoke is lord of\r\nthe manor in the present day.  A Roman urn, as has been stated elsewhere,\r\nwas dug up in this parish when the railway was being constructed.  The\r\nonly public notice in connection with Thornton of an unusual character,\r\nin modern times, is the following, which appeared as an advertisement in\r\nthe “Stamford Mercury” of January 5th, 1810:—SACRILEGE.—Whereas the\r\nParish Church of Thornton, near Horncastle, has been lately broken open\r\nand a thin silver half-pint cup stolen out of the chest, any person\r\ngiving information of the offender or offenders, shall, on conviction,\r\nreceive from the parishioners of Thornton five guineas reward, and if\r\nthere was an accomplice in the above sacrilege who will turn King’s\r\nevidence, he shall, on conviction, have the above reward, and every\r\nendeavour will be used to obtain his Majesty’s pardon.—“Lincs. N. & Q.,”\r\nOct., 1896.\r\n\r\nIn a list of gentry who furnished “launces and light horse” for the\r\ndefence of the country in 1584, given in the Melbourn Hall MS., we find\r\nthe name of Edward Dymmock, of Thornton, Gent., put down for “j light\r\nhorse” for the master at Horncastle, and among those who were summoned\r\nfor the Sessions there, according to another list, we again find Edward\r\nDymmock of Thornton, Gent. (“Architect. S. Journal,” vol. xxii., pt. ii.,\r\npp. 214 and 221).  In a grass field, on the south side of the road\r\nthrough Thornton, there are mounds and hollows, indicating a large\r\nresidence, which this Dymmock probably occupied.\r\n\r\nProceeding three quarters of a mile further southward, and passing Martin\r\nHall, we turn up a lane to the right and find the church of Martin, St.\r\nMichael’s, in a secluded spot, like many a flower born to blush unseen.\r\nYet it is worthy of a visit, having features of more than ordinary\r\ninterest, which were well preserved on its partial restoration in 1869,\r\nand again by the late W. J. Gilliatt, of the Hall, and his sisters, in\r\n1877.  For many years it was a thatched edifice, but now has a slated\r\nroof.  The south doorway is Early Norman, with broad, receding\r\nsemi-circular arch, with a double band of zigzag moulding; on each side,\r\nNorman columns, with, quaint heads as capitals.  The church is entered by\r\ntwo descending steps.  The font is modern, Norman in style, the bowl\r\nhaving eight semi-circular fluttings, being supported by eight columns\r\nraised on a stone pediment.  The west window is filled with good modern\r\nglass from Munich.  The central subject is the Saviour’s body being taken\r\ndown from the Cross; the left subject is the Saviour bearing His Cross;\r\nthe right, the body being borne away.  This was a memorial, placed in the\r\nchurch by Miss Spalding, of Lincoln, commemorative of the Rev. J. B.\r\nSmith, D.D., the rector, who, in returning from paying her a visit at\r\nLincoln, fell out of his railway carriage at Kirkstead and broke his\r\nneck, although, strange to say, he lived for several weeks afterwards.\r\n{204}  In the north wall of the nave is a plain arched Easter sepulchre,\r\nwhich was probably the founder’s tomb.  The pulpit is of Caen stone,\r\nplain, and massive; behind it is a curious semi-circular recess, in the\r\neast wall.  The chancel arch is Early English, and very narrow, only 3ft.\r\n9in. in width, which makes the chancel very dark, an effect further\r\nincreased by the great thickness, 3ft. 4in., of the chancel arch wall.\r\nThe east window has two trefoiled lights, small and narrow, their total\r\nwidth only 2ft. 3in.  In the south wall of the chancel are two\r\ndeeply-recessed small square-headed windows, partly built up, and having\r\na stone seat at the base, but too high for use.  There are several flat\r\ntombstones of Hughsons and Oldhams in the floor.  The Early Norman\r\ndoorway and the massive chancel arch wall and gloomy chancel are the\r\nspecial features of this interesting little church.  At the time of the\r\nrestoration, in 1877, the original large altar slab, decorated with four\r\ncrosses, was found in the floor, face downwards.  It was taken, up, and\r\nnow forms the base, or däis, of the Communion table.  The Parish Register\r\ncommences with 1562.  Under the year 1649 occurs this entry:—“This yeare\r\nye lordship of Marton was inclosed; no consent of Bishop or Rector.”  The\r\nunusual name, “Ingelo,” specially known in connection with the poem, “The\r\nBells of Enderby,” occurs frequently in the Registers from 1673\r\ndownwards.  The names of Norreys Fynes, and other members of the family,\r\nresident at White-Hall, in this parish, occur frequently.  There is an\r\nengraving of the church in the “Church of England Magazine” for 1849.  We\r\nmust not omit to mention that the fine fragment of brickwork called the\r\n“Tower on the Moor,” and co-eval with Tattershall Castle, although now\r\nincluded in the Civil parish of Woodhall Spa, stands in what was part of\r\nMartin parish till 1897.  There only remains the staircase of what was\r\nonce a much larger structure.  Leland says, “One of the Cromwelles\r\nbuilded a preaty turret caullid the Tour of the Moore: and thereby he\r\nmade a faire greate pond or lake brickid about.  The lake is commonly\r\ncalled the Synkker” (Itinerarium, vol. iv., p. 58).\r\n\r\nScott, the celebrated commentator, began his ministerial labours in this\r\nparish.\r\n\r\nIn early times.  Martin was in the “soke” of Kirkby-on-Bain, i.e., it was\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the lord of the manor of Kirkby, who, in the\r\ntime of the Conqueror, was Eudo, son of Spirewick, the founder {205a} of\r\nthe Tateshall, or Tattershall, family in Lincolnshire.  This Eudo, as\r\nDugdale relates, {205b} with his sworn brother in arms, Pinso (though no\r\nblood relation), came into England with the Conqueror, and the two\r\nmerited so well of him in that service that they obtained for recompense\r\nthe lordship of Tattershall, with the hamlet of Thorpe, and town of\r\nKirkby.  He held direct from the king certain lands in Martin; and as the\r\nClintons, shortly after the extinction of the Tattershall family,\r\nreceived their estates, this would be the way in which the Whitehall\r\nestate in Martin came to the Clintons.\r\n\r\nJourneying on still southward, some mile and a half from Martin, we reach\r\nthe parish of Roughton.  The church has no pretensions to architectural\r\nbeauty, being a mixture of brick and sandstone.  It has nave, chancel,\r\nand castellated tower, and small castellated parapets at the north and\r\nsouth ends of the chancel wall; a large west door, and small priests’\r\ndoor in the chancel.  It was newly roofed and fitted with open oak\r\nbenches in 1870, the chancel being then also paved with encaustic tiles,\r\nthe tower opened to the nave, and most of the windows partly filled with\r\nstained glass.  The font is plain, circular, upon a circular pediment; it\r\nhas an old font cover, cupola shaped, octagonal, of oak, plain, except\r\nsome slight carving round the rim.  There are some fragmentary remains of\r\na carved rood screen, and a plain old oak pulpit.  In the chancel is a\r\nlengthy inscription, commemorative of Norreys Fynes, Esq., which has\r\nalready been given to a previous chapter in connection with Fynes of\r\nWhitehall.  There is also a mural tablet to the memory of the Rev. Arthur\r\nRockliffe, who died in 1798; and another to Charles Pilkington, Esq., who\r\ndied in 1798, and Abigail his wife, who died in 1817.  The register dates\r\nfrom 1564, and is therefore a fairly good one, since parochial registers\r\nwere only first enjoined in the reign of Henry VIII., 1530–1538.  The\r\nregisters contain some peculiar entries, and exhibit a remarkable\r\northography, if such a term can be applied to what would more correctly\r\nbe called orthography.  Of these entries one is as follows:—The\r\nchurchyard fence was repaired by lengths in 1760, each parishioner (of\r\nany substance) taking a length; a list of their names is given, closing\r\nwith the words “a piece to the Lord,” i.e., the lord of the manor.  In\r\nthe year 1631–2 there were 43 burials; among them the rector, Randulph\r\nWoodinge, on Oct. 23nd; his daughter Ann, Oct. 23rd; and daughter\r\nThomasine, Nov. 1st.  There were two of the family of Carrot, two\r\nLincolns, two Applebys, two Grogbys, three Hawards, two Burches, besides\r\nother single cases.  Though it is not so specified, this would doubtless\r\nbe the epidemic called “the Plague,” or “Black Death.”\r\n\r\nAn entry on “Aprill the 15 1707” gives “The Church More lying in Well\r\nsick cloase was leten for 4 & 6.”  This is moorland near Well Syke wood\r\nbelonging to the church, from which peat was cut for church fuel; and two\r\nother entries refer to this practice: “Simon Grant of Dalderby for 1 days\r\nwork of bages (i.e., sods) . . . 2 ,, 6.”  “Simon flinte for 1 days works\r\nof bages . . . 2 „ 6.”  This was good pay according to the rate of wages\r\nin the early part of the 18th century, to which these entries refer.  But\r\nit was “skilled” labour, and, moreover, hard work, as anyone will\r\nunderstand who remembers the instrument used on the moor forty years ago.\r\nIt was a large, flat, and broad kind of shovel at the end of a long pole\r\nwith transverse handle a foot long, which was placed against the\r\nworkman’s waist or pit of his stomach, and he thus thrust the tool\r\nforward through the turf with the whole weight and force of his body.\r\nThose who were much engaged in this kind of work usually suffered from\r\nrupture of the lower muscles of the body.\r\n\r\nFor some years before 1657 none but civil marriages were valid in law,\r\nand Justice Filkin is mentioned in the Register as marrying the Rector of\r\nRoughton, John Bancroft, to Ann Coulen.  Persons were often married in\r\nthe church, as well as before the Justice; the civil marriage was also\r\noften neglected, and the feeling was generally so strong that marriage\r\nshould be a religious rite, that in the year 1657 marriage by the\r\nminister was allowed by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nA peculiar entry in the parish account book is “Mary Would overseer of ye\r\npoore gave up hir accountes” (1707 Ap. 15).  We are now, at the beginning\r\nof the 20th century, admitting women to a limited number of public\r\noffices, yet the people of Roughton were evidently in advance of the\r\ntimes, and forestalled us 180 yeans ago.  One or two curious instances of\r\nspelling may here be given, showing that the schoolmaster was not then\r\nmuch in evidence:—“1703 Beuerils, &c.”; “1705 Bearths, Robert ye son of\r\nbniamen hehuhinson (Benjamin Hewinson) and jane his wife was borne ye 15\r\nday of january.”  “Burial.  John Snow, Inn-holder, July 3d., 1765”; “1707\r\nRebekah Leach was beureid July the 10”; “1708 John Bouth and Doryty his\r\nwife”; “Rebekah Langcaster 1725, the douter of Joseph Langcaster.”  “John\r\nSwingo the sun of John Swingo and Ann his wife howous (was) Baptized the\r\n17 of Aprill 1709.”  This name, in another entry, 1733, is given as\r\nSwinsgo; the modern spelling is Swinscoe.\r\n\r\nThe names of some good families appear, as “An the wife of Will Hennag\r\nwas buered ye 9 of Feberery, 1729”; “Madame Elizabeth fines was buered\r\nMay ye 29, 1730”; “George soun of Mr. Clinton Whichcote 1624”; and,\r\nlater, “Mary the wife of John Gaunt, and Anthony, son of John Gaunt, were\r\nburied Dec. 16, 1803.”  The Hall, not an ancient moated mansion, like so\r\nmany described in these pages, but yet one of some antiquity, has been\r\noccupied at different times, by members of several leading county\r\nfamilies, as Fynes, Whichcote, Heneage, Dymoke, Pilkington, and Beaumont.\r\nIt has belonged to the Dymokes, as also the patronage of the benefice,\r\nalthough Sir H. M. Hawley is lord of the manor.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Elizabeth a family of Eastwoods was located here, as the\r\nRecords shew that Andrew Eastwood of Roughton was among the gentry who\r\ncontributed £25 each to the Armada Fund for the defence of England.\r\n{208a}  By a Chancery Inquisition, post mortem, 22 Richard II., No. 13,\r\ntaken at Market Staynton, the feast of St. Luke the Evangelist (1399\r\nA.D.), before William Bolle, escheator, it was shewn that “Ralph de\r\nCromwell, chivaler, held jointly with his wife Matilda, besides other\r\nproperty, the manor of Tumby with appurtenances in Rughton, Wodehall,\r\nLangton,” etc.  And again, in a later Inquisition, post mortem, 13 Henry\r\nVII., No. 34, taken at Burwell, it was shewn that “the said Matilda\r\nWillughby died seised in fee tail of the manor of Kirkeby upon Bayne, and\r\nlands in Roughton, Woodhall, Langton,” &c. {208b}\r\n\r\nIn Domesday Book, the powerful Robert Despenser is named as having in\r\nRoughton twelve oxgangs rateable to gelt, with three sokemen, and a half\r\nsokeman holding two carucates of land with three draught oxen; also\r\nfifteen acres of meadow land, a fishery worth 2s. yearly, and forty acres\r\nof woodland, containing pasturage in parts.  The name is there given as\r\n“Roc-stune,” whether from any Druidical boulder, or sacred stone, or\r\nlandmark, does not appear to be known.\r\n\r\nFrom Roughton, going eastward by a ford on the river Bain, or returning\r\nto Horncastle and taking the main road south-eastward, we arrive, a\r\nlittle over two miles distant, at Scrivelsby, a village which is unique\r\nin the kingdom, since there is but one King’s Champion, and he is “Lord\r\nof Scrivelsby.”  As we approach Scrivelsby {208c} Court, by a road shaded\r\nby stately trees of hoar antiquity, with the well-wooded park on our\r\nleft, and fields, nicely timbered and interspersed with copses, on our\r\nright, we pause, after a slight ascent, at a point where three ways meet.\r\nBefore us stands the “Lion gateway,” a substantial arched stone structure\r\nwith sculptured Lion “passant” surmounting it; the Royal beast indicating\r\nthe official hereditary honour of the head of the family as the\r\nSovereign’s Champion.  On our right, in a humbler position of less\r\nprominence, under the shade of trees, and green with age, still survive\r\nthe parish stocks.  Thus the emblems of civil and military power confront\r\neach other.  The Court itself, standing some 150 yards from this gateway,\r\nis approached through another arch in the wall of the Courtyard.  The\r\npresent building is not one of large proportions, the chief part of the\r\nold baronial residence having been destroyed by fire about 130 years ago;\r\nto replace which modern additions were made, on a smaller scale, early in\r\nthe 19th century.  Of the portion destroyed a chief feature was a very\r\nlarge hall, with wainscoted panels, on which “were depicted the arms and\r\nalliances of the family through its numerous and far-traced descents.”\r\n{209a}  The chief features of interest now remaining within are some of\r\nthe suits of armour worn by Champions, and a collection of “Champion\r\nCups.”  The collection of armour was much finer a few years ago, but, on\r\nthe extinction of the line of the late Sir Henry Dymoke, most of these\r\nwere dispersed by sale, and the Cups were bequeathed to the Queen,\r\nalthough Her Majesty, through the intermediation of the late Right\r\nHonourable E. Stanhope, most graciously restored them to the father of\r\nthe present Champion.  On the wall of the “Lion gateway,” to the right of\r\nthe arch, is a rebus, or “canting” device, formed of a rude\r\nrepresentation of a tree dividing in a Y shape referring to an old-time\r\nemblem of the family.  As the Plantagenets had their “planta genista,”\r\nthe broom; so the Dymokes would seem to have had their “oak.” {209b}  The\r\ndescent of the early Dymokes may be briefly given thus:—Scrivelsby,\r\nforming part of the Soke of Horncastle, of which the Conqueror held the\r\nmanor, was given by William to Robert Dispenser, his steward, whom we\r\nhave several times named in connection with other neighbouring parishes.\r\nFrom him it passed, by some process unknown, to the Marmions.  The last\r\nLord Marmyon died in 1292, and the Lincolnshire portion of his\r\nestates,—for Sir Walter Scott describes him as\r\n\r\n          “Lord of Fontenay,\r\n    Of Lutterworth and Scrivelsbay,\r\n    Of Tamworth tower and town.”—\r\n\r\npassed to his younger daughter, Joan, whose granddaughter, Margaret de\r\nLudlow, married, in the reign of Edward III., Sir John Dymoke, who acted\r\nas Champion at the coronation of Richard II., and from that time, more\r\nthan 500 years, the Dymokes have acted in that capacity for their\r\nrespective Sovereigns, down to the last century, the ceremony, however,\r\nhaving been dispensed with, to the regret of many, on the accessions of\r\nWilliam IV., Queen Victoria, and our present Most Gracious Majesty King\r\nEdward VII.\r\n\r\nAs this, formerly, State ceremony was so imposing, and of such antiquity,\r\nit deserves more than a passing notice.  We here give a description of\r\nit, as observed at the coronation of Queen Mary, from the account of\r\nPlanché, in the Royal Records.  “At the close of the second course of the\r\nCoronation Banquet, the Champion, Sir Edward Dymoke, entered Westminster\r\nHall, riding on a roan destrier (war horse) trapped in cloth of gold,\r\nwith a mace in one hand and a gauntlet in the other.  He was escorted to\r\nthe upper end of the hall by the Lord High Constable, and the Earl\r\nMarshall, and the Herald of the Queen with a trumpet; and after he had\r\nmade obeisance to the Queen’s highness, he turned him a little aside, and\r\nwith a loud voice made proclamation, ‘If there be any manner of man, of\r\nwhat estate, degree, or condition soever he be, that will say, and\r\nmaintain, that our Sovereign Lady Queen Mary, this day here present, is\r\nnot the rightful, and undoubted, heretrix to the Imperial Crown of this\r\nrealm of England, and that of right she ought not to be crowned Queen, I\r\nsay he lieth as a false traitor, and that I am ready the same to maintain\r\nwith him, whilst I have breath in my body, either now at this time, or at\r\nany other time, whensoever it shall please the Queen’s highness to\r\nappoint; and thereupon the same I cast him my gage.’  Then he cast the\r\ngauntlet from him, the which no man would take up, till that a herald\r\ntook it up and gave it to him again.  Then he proceeded to another place,\r\nand did in this manner, in three several places in the said Hall.  Then\r\nhe came to the upper end, and the Queen drank to him; and after sent to\r\nhim the cup, which he had for his fee, and likewise the harness and\r\ntrappings, and all the harness which he did himself wear, and then he\r\nreturned to the place from whence he came, and was gone.”  On the last\r\noccasion, when this ceremony was observed, viz., at the coronation of\r\nGeorge IV., the rightful champion being in Holy Orders, his son Henry,\r\nafterwards Sir H. Dymoke, Bart., was allowed to act for his father, who\r\nwas the eighteenth of the hereditary champions of his family.  Sir Walter\r\nScott was present, and, writing to a friend, says, “Young Dymoke is a\r\nfine-looking youth, but bearing perhaps a little too much the appearance\r\nof a maiden knight to be a challenger of the world.”  But he adds, with\r\nthe eye of an antiquary, “His armour was in good taste, except that his\r\nshield was out of all propriety, being a round ‘Rondache,’ or Highland\r\ntarget, impossible to use on horseback, instead of being a\r\nthree-cornered, or leather, shield, which, in the time of the Tilt, was\r\nsuspended round the neck.  However, on the whole . . . the Lord of\r\nScrivelsby looked and behaved extremely well.” {211}\r\n\r\nOne _contre-temps_, however, occurred on this occasion, which Sir Walter,\r\nperhaps, thought it polite, or politic, not to mention; others have not\r\nhad the same scruples, and hence an incident is recorded which may have\r\nhad something to do with the future omission of the ceremony.  The Duke\r\nof Wellington, as Lord High Constable, had to ride by the Champion’s\r\nside, with the Deputy Earl Marshal on the other side.  It was part of the\r\nobservance that, in withdrawing from the Sovereign’s presence, the riders\r\nshould back their horses, keeping their heads towards the King.  The\r\nDuke, in his anxiety that all should go without a hitch, had hired a\r\nhorse from Astley’s circus, which had been specially trained for that\r\npart of the ceremony; but, unfortunately, the intelligent animal chose\r\nthe wrong stage in the ceremony for the performance, and most\r\nconscientiously and obstinately persisted in turning tail and backing\r\n_towards_ the King instead of from him, and was with difficulty slewed\r\nround by the attendants. {212a}\r\n\r\nIt were much to be desired that this picturesque and interesting relic of\r\nfeudal custom’s might be restored.  The present may be an age of new-born\r\nenergies, and even revolutionary ideas, but the spirit of “Reverentia\r\nCani” is by no means extinguished, and the interest in old institutions\r\nseems ever widening and deepening in the general sentiment.\r\n\r\nAs a curiosity I will give here a bill, sent in by Sir Edward Dymoke to\r\nSir William Cecil (he spells it “Syscell”) for the cost of some of the\r\narticles necessary to him as Champion at the coronation of Mary, which he\r\nseems to have had a difficulty in getting paid, although he was, by\r\ncustom, entitled to them.\r\n\r\n    Stuff yt Phyllyp Lenthall have delyvered to Sir Edward Dymocke.\r\n\r\n    Item for a showrde (_a_) and gerdyll (_b_), and scabbart (_c_) of\r\n    velvet . . . xls\r\n\r\n    Item for ij pardeynzyns (_d_) gylte (_e_) . . . xls\r\n\r\n    Item for a poll (_f_) ax . . . xxs\r\n\r\n    Item for a chasynge (_g_) staff . . . vis viiid\r\n\r\n    Item for a gylte payre of spowres (_h_) . . . xvis\r\n\r\n    Sm total VI£ ..  IIs .. VIIId. {212b}\r\n\r\nIt may strike us as singular that so high an official as the King’s\r\nChampion should perpetrate such spelling as the above; but those were\r\ndays in which many a baron bold found it easier to inscribe his name on\r\nthe scroll of fame, by dint of his trusty sword, than by the clerkly\r\ncrowquill.\r\n\r\nThe church of Scrivelsby was thoroughly restored in 1861, and further\r\nimprovements made in 1876, the previous structure being a poor one.  Sir\r\nHenry added, at his own cost, a spire.  The most interesting features of\r\nthe former building were carefully retained.  There is an aumbrey, in a\r\ncurious position, near the north-west door.  The font is octagonal, on\r\npedestal, apparently modern, the faces having poppy head and other simple\r\ndevices.  There is a tomb, of Lewis Dymoke, under the reading desk, in\r\nthe nave; in the north aisle, having Early English columns of three bays,\r\nand eastward two bays with Norman columns, there are recumbent figures of\r\na knight and lady (supposed to be Sir Philip Marmion and wife), the male\r\nfigure with shield, delapidated, the female entire.  At the east end of\r\nthe same aisle is the tomb of Sir Robert Dymoke, “upon whose soule\r\nAlmightie God have m’ie.  Amen.”  There is a good rood screen in the\r\nchancel.  In 1899 a beautiful window was given, of coloured glass, by\r\nMrs. Dymoke, of the Court, in memory of her husband, Francis Scaman\r\nDymoke, the Hon. the Queen’s Champion.  The subjects illustrated are (1)\r\nOur Lord preaching the sermon on the Mount, and (2) in the act of\r\nblessing little children, under the former of which are the words\r\n“Blessed are the pure in heart,” and under the latter “Suffer little\r\nchildren to come unto me.”  In the chancel is also a rich mural monument\r\nto Lewis Dymoke, “who performed the service at the coronation of George\r\nI. and George II.  He was the youngest son of Sir Charles Dymoke and\r\nEleanor eldest daughter of the first Lord Rockingham.”  There are two\r\nother tablets, on the north and south walls, of Dymokes, and others in\r\nthe floor; also a tablet to John Tyrwhitt, Esq., of Pentre Park, and his\r\nwife Sophia, a Dymoke; and another of the Rev. I. Bradshaw Tyrwhitt, of\r\nWilksby.  In the churchyard are also tombs of Dymokes, one a massive\r\nstructure opposite the east window, containing the remains of the late\r\nSir Henry Dymoke, Bart., and Emma his wife.  There are also many\r\ntombstones of the Gilliat family.  Some years ago, when repairs were\r\nbeing made in the church, the flooring was removed, and a skeleton was\r\ndiscovered without a head, a block of clay lying in place of the skull.\r\nThis was supposed to be the remains of Sir Thomas Dymoke, who, with his\r\nrelative, Lord Welles, was beheaded by Edward IV., in London, at the time\r\nof the Battle of “Loosecoat field,” near Stamford, 1470, when the\r\nfugitive rebels threw off their coats to expedite their flight.\r\n\r\nAmong the privileges of the Champion family was the right to hold a\r\nmarket and fair at Scrivelsby, first granted, 42 and 43 Henry III., to\r\nPhilip de Marmyon, to which he proved his claim in the 9th year of Edwd.\r\nI.; also the right of free warren over the Manor of Scrivelsby, and to\r\nerect a gallows for the punishment of felons at Scrivelsby.  Where the\r\ngallows were erected is not known.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Dymoke, Sheriff of Lincolnshire 27 Henry VIII., and also 1 Ed.\r\nVI. and 2 and 3 Philip and Mary, married Anne, sister and coheir to\r\nGilbert, Lord Taillebois of Kyme; by which alliance the castle and manors\r\nof North and South Kyme came to the Dymoke family, and members of the\r\nfamily resided there until it was sold, about 1730, to the Duke of\r\nNewcastle.  This Sir Edward had issue Sir Robert Sir Charles, and a\r\ndaughter Elizabeth, who married Henry Ascough, a member of a very old and\r\ndistinguished family.  Sir Robert Dymoke, Champion to James I., married\r\nwell, the daughter of Edward Clinton, Lord Clinton and Saye, afterwards\r\ncreated Earl of Lincoln and a K.G.  Her mother had been the widow of\r\nGilbert, Lord Taillebois, previously a mistress of Hen. VII., by whom she\r\nhad a son, created Duke of Richmond.\r\n\r\nCharles Dymoke, who died, unmarried, at Oxford in 1644, was a zealous\r\nsupporter of his unfortunate Sovereign, Charles I., and by his Will\r\nbequeathed £2,000 (a large sum in those days) to relieve his necessities.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Dymoke, at the time of the Commonwealth, being, from his\r\noffice and his loyalty, obnoxious to the Republican party, was fined, for\r\nhis “delinquency,” £200 a year, and yet was obliged to pay the further,\r\nthen enormous, sum of £4,633.\r\n\r\nHis son, Sir Charles, was highly esteemed for his loyalty, and was put\r\ndown among those who were to be created by Charles II.  “Knights of the\r\nRoyal Oak,” in grateful remembrance of the King being saved in an oak at\r\nBoscobel in Staffordshire, resting on the lap of Colonel Careless,\r\nafterwards Carlos.\r\n\r\nThe Dymokes’ estates were greatly reduced by sale in the year 1871, when\r\nmost, if not all, the lands not entailed were disposed of.  Within the\r\nwriter’s memory the Dymokes shot over lands extending from their own door\r\n(with the exception of the Ostler ground) to Kirkstead wharf.\r\n\r\nWe must here, however, pass on our way from Scrivelsby, although we shall\r\nmeet with Dymokes again in the next parish.\r\n\r\nTaking an accommodation road {215} which branches off westward from the\r\nmain road opposite the Lion gate, and going through some fields, past the\r\nmodern rectory, a substantial residence, we emerge, by an old cottage,\r\nwhose roof, covered with ancient drab-coloured slates or slabs, reaches,\r\non one side, to the ground, upon another main road leading to Boston.\r\nPursuing this about a mile and a half, and passing a disused churchyard,\r\nwith two or three gravestones and no church, at Dalderby, we reach the\r\nvillage of Haltham.  Here we have a church of considerable interest.\r\nTaking the exterior first, we find a remarkable semi-circular tympanum\r\nover the door, within the porch on the south.  It has a kind of Maltese\r\ncross within a circle, with a second circle running through the limbs of\r\nthe cross.  Below this is a small round object, with an oblong on each\r\nside of it; and below them, to the east, is an oval figure like a buckle,\r\nwhile below, to the west, is a square, having three-quarter circles at\r\nits corners, and semi-circles in the middle of its sides, which form the\r\nextremities of a cross, and between the limbs and the sides of the square\r\nare roundels.  Below this is a curious lobated object, with what may be\r\ncalled a fish placed perpendicularly on it; east of the circle containing\r\nthe Maltese cross are four rows of inverted triangles, of different\r\nlengths; below them, within a circle, is a curious figure, made of twelve\r\nunequal curved lines, arranged in four groups of threes, and forming a\r\ntriple Fylfot or Swastica.  Touching the east side of this circle is\r\nanother, which cuts into the border of the base of the tympanum at its\r\neastern corner, containing a cross within a square similar to that on the\r\nwest side.  This very curious tympanum is Early Norman, or possibly\r\nSaxon. {216}  There is a priest’s door in the south wall of the chancel.\r\nThere was once a north door in the nave, now bricked up.  There was a\r\nlarge western door, round arched, with triple moulding, now also bricked\r\nup.  Over this door are two stone gurgoyles, one above the other, let\r\ninto recesses in the west wall, which is mainly of brick.  The length of\r\nthe nave, externally, is 150ft.; and its breadth, with the porch, is\r\n150ft.  The length of the chancel is 30ft.  The east window is a fine,\r\ndecorated, flamboyant specimen, its date being about 1350, which has been\r\ncopied on a larger scale, in St. Mary’s Church, Horncastle.\r\n\r\nTaking the interior, the sittings are all of very old oak, many of them\r\nwith rudely carved poppy heads.  There are very fine, heavy, old oak,\r\ncarved canopies over two long pews in the north aisle for the Champion\r\nDymokes and their servants.  These, probably, were taken from a former\r\nrood screen.  There is now a low screen, fragmentary, in the chancel, and\r\nan oak pulpit, old but plain.  There is a piscina, with two fronts, in\r\nthe south wall of the chancel, and a series of three sedilia and an\r\naumbrey in the north wall; also carved brackets on each side of the east\r\nwindow.  The font stands in the north-east corner of the north aisle, on\r\na very broad base which serves as a seat.  The north aisle has three bays\r\nwith round arches, and two eastward with pointed arches.  The windows\r\nthroughout are perpendicular, but either square-topped or debased, except\r\nthe fine east window, and one in the south wall of nave, of two lights.\r\nThere is an incised slab to one of the Dymokes.  The bell chamber is\r\nclosed by ancient boarding adorned with the Commandments in old\r\ncharacters, and very curious Royal arms of Charles I.  There are three\r\nbells, and a very curious old ladder, constructed of rude beams, leading\r\nup to the belfry.  Miss Spurrier, the Rector’s daughter, assisted by the\r\ncoachman, have improved the church by renovating the screen.  This lady\r\nhas also carved a cover for the font in very delicate pattern, the\r\nironwork being done by the village blacksmith, Mr. Priestley.\r\n\r\nIn the village is an old hostel, partly of the Tudor style, with pointed\r\ngable ends, projecting upper story, and constructed, externally, of brick\r\nand woodwork.\r\n\r\nIn the parish register, at the bottom of the page containing the entries\r\nfor the year 1584, by way of accounting for the number of funerals (51),\r\nis the following note: “This yeare plague in Haltham.”  Although Haltham\r\nand Roughton are ecclesiastically united, and, in position, contiguous,\r\nthere were, in that year, no extra deaths in Roughton; while in the year\r\n1631–2 there were 43 burials at Roughton, and no increase of mortality at\r\nHaltham.  The only peculiar record which I can find in connection with\r\nHaltham is a “Feet of Fines, Lincoln, 9 Henry III., No. 52,” too long to\r\nbe quoted in full, which contains an agreement between Henry del Ortiay\r\nand Sabina his wife on the one hand, and Ralph de Rhodes on the other\r\nhand, tenant of lands with appurtenances, in Horncastre, Upper Tynton,\r\nCuningbye, Holtham, &c., whereby the said Henry and his wife recognise\r\nthe said lands &c. to be the right of Ralph; he on his part granting to\r\nHenry and Sabina other land with appurtenances, in Upper Tynton; certain\r\nof the lands being designated Pese-wang, Leir-me-Wang, Whete-wang, and\r\nKrunce Wong, with Hethotenacre (Heath of ten acre), Sexacre, and other\r\nnames.  These names illustrate what was said on a previous page regarding\r\nthe field named “the Wong,” at Horncastle.  A very curious feature of the\r\nagreement is that the said Henry and Sabina are “to have and to hold”\r\nthese lands “of the aforesaid Ralph and his heirs forever, rendering\r\ntherefor, by the year, one pair of gilt spurs, or 6d., at Easter, for all\r\nservice and exaction.” {217}\r\n\r\nHaving thus made our halt at Haltham, we bid adieu to the place, and push\r\non southward.  Passing Tumby Lawn, the residence of Sir H. M. Hawley,\r\nsurrounded by leafy groves, within whose shade (teste scriptore) Philomel\r\ndoth pour forth (malgré the poets) _his_ flood of song, while a whole\r\ncoterie of other birds in “amorous descant” join; and sheltered from the\r\neast by the extensive woods of Haltham, Fulsby, and Tumby, remains of the\r\nwhilom “Tumby Chase,” we find ourselves, at the end of some three and a\r\nhalf miles, entering the main street of Coningsby.  Here again, we might\r\nask, with love-sick Juliet, “What’s in a name?”  But, in sooth, a name\r\nmay be an epitome of history.  There is an old proverb that “knowledge is\r\npower,” and we might say, the name of Coningsby is a territorial\r\nexemplification and perpetuation of this adage.  In the language once\r\nspoken in these parts, {218} the conning, cunning man and the king were\r\none and the same; the king _was_ king because he was the conner, the\r\nthinker, and so overtopped his fellows in cunning.  He embodied in his\r\nown person the moral of every age of progress, that brute force must\r\nyield the palm to skill and judgment.  Mob-rule may for a while snatch\r\nat, and hold, the mastery; but ’tis the man who has the cunning to bide\r\nhis time, and then seize the opportunity, who will be borne in triumph on\r\nthe shoulders of those who once hustled and jostled him.  Within some\r\nmiles northward of where I am writing lies Kingthorpe, “the king’s\r\nvillage”; and at just about the same distance southward lies Coningsby,\r\nwith precisely the same meaning.  Both names imply the presence at one\r\ntime of a king; who he may have been we do not know, but he put down his\r\nfoot there, and the stamp remains.  There was once a castellated\r\nresidence here, the home of the Coningsby family; and one of them,\r\nThomas, was created Earl of Coningsby, but, dying without issue, the\r\ntitle became extinct in 1729.  I may here mention that the tomb of the\r\nlast Countess of Coningsby is in the north chantry chapel of Heydour\r\nchurch (between Sleaford and Grantham); it is a marble monument by\r\nRijsbrach.  There is also a slab to the last Viscount, 1733, who is\r\ntraditionally said to have been taken from his cradle by a pet monkey,\r\nand dropped by it, in the terror of pursuit, from the roof of the house\r\non to the stone pavement below, and so killed.  The position of this old\r\nConingsby mansion is not precisely known; but in a field on the south\r\nside of the main street there is an ancient dove-cot, and some fine\r\ntrees, such as one might expect about a baronial residence.  The\r\nConingsbys moved from Coningsby to Hampton Court in Herefordshire more\r\nthan two centuries ago. {219a}  There was a very fine collection of\r\npictures at this place, a list of which was given in the “Gentleman’s\r\nMagazine” of April 26, 1826.  Among these was a painting of the old\r\nmansion of Coningsby.  Hampton Court is now the residence of John\r\nArkwright, Esq., and is situated between Hereford and Leominster.  But\r\n“vixere fortes ante Agamemnona,” and there were men of mark at Coningsby\r\nlong before those who took its name as their patronymic.  In Domesday\r\nBook we find that Sortibrand, the son of Ulf, the Saxon, who was one of\r\nthe Lagmen of Lincoln, and had “sac and soc {219b} over three mansions in\r\nthat city,” as successor to his father (loco Ulf patris sui), held a\r\nberewick (a corn farm) in Coningsby.\r\n\r\nWhen the powerful favourite of the Conqueror, Robert Despenser, laid\r\nclaim to a fishery and certain land in Coningsby, the Jurymen of the\r\nWapentake of Horncastle decided that his claim was good, because Achi,\r\nhis Saxon predecessor, had held the same in the time of Edward the\r\nConfessor.  Moreover, the said Robert Despenser already held in Coningsby\r\na berewick—“bere” (barley) land—of nine oxgangs, or some 225 acres, of\r\nmeadow and wood, besides land in a score more parishes.  And, again, from\r\nthe same source we learn that a noble Fleming, Drogo de Bruere, who\r\nfought under the Conqueror at the battle of Hastings, and was rewarded by\r\nthe gift of the whole of Holderness in Yorkshire, and other manors in\r\nLincolnshire and elsewhere, also held land in Coningsby.  Of this noble,\r\nCamden relates that the Conqueror valued his services so highly that he\r\nbestowed his own niece upon him in marriage; but that he destroyed her by\r\npoison, and then fled the country, all attempts to discover him having\r\nfailed down to the time of the Domesday Survey being taken. {220a}\r\n\r\nIn the List of the Gentry of Lincolnshire, made on the Herald’s\r\nVisitation of the county in 1634, and still preserved at the Herald’s\r\nCollege, are the names of John Carter and Clinton Whichcote, of\r\nConingsby. {220b}\r\n\r\nIn a Chancery Inquisition, post mortem, taken 31st May, 10 Henry VII.,\r\nNo. 72 (1495), it was found that Robert Taillebois, Knight, and John\r\nGygour, Clerk, Warden of the College of Tatteshale, were “seized in their\r\ndemesne as of fee of the manors of South Kyme, North Kyme, Conyngsby,\r\nDokdyke, Byllingay,” and other properties. {220c}  While, as an evidence\r\nof the trade of Coningsby, in a list of “Lincolnshire Town and Traders’\r\nTokens,” made by the late Mr. C. J. Caswell, of Horncastle, there occurs\r\none of a Coningsby tradesman, bearing on the obverse side, “John\r\nLupton—The Baker’s Arms,” and on the reverse side, “Of Cunsby, 1663—J. A.\r\nL.” {220d}  Mr. Caswell adds a note that “where three initials are given,\r\nas in this case, the issuer’s wife is included, sometimes joined in a\r\ntrue lover’s knot.  Mr. John Lupton (in the present day) is a well-known\r\nand respected farmer of Pinchbeck West.  His daughter married T. A.\r\nRoberts, Esq., M.R.C.S., late of Coningsby.”\r\n\r\nI have already, in connection with Haltham, quoted an old Record, Feet of\r\nFines, 9 Henry III., No. 52, which gives an agreement between Henry del\r\nOrtiay and Sabina his wife, as plaintiffs, on the one part, and Ralph de\r\nRhodes on the other part, holding lands in Coningsby, Haltham, Marynge\r\n(Mareham), and other places; by which they recognise these lands as his\r\nby right, and, in return, he assigns certain land to them in Upper\r\nTynton, to have and to hold for ever, by the tenure of a pair of gilt\r\nspurs, given annually.  This brings this powerful baron into connection\r\nwith Coningsby. {221a}  While further, in a Feet of Fines, 19 Henry VII.\r\n(1503), on the Octave of Holy Trinity, an agreement is given between Sir\r\nEdward Ponyngs, Knt., Sir Thomas Fenys (Fynes?), Knt., Sir John Peeche,\r\nKnt., John Mordaunt, and others, plaintiffs, on the one part, and Sir\r\nGeorge Nevyll, of Burgavenny, Knight, and Joan his wife, deforciants,\r\nwhereby George and Joan recognise certain lands in Conysby, Halton,\r\nBelcheford, and elsewhere, to be the right of John Mordaunt, for which\r\nthe plaintiffs gave them £l,000. {221b}  Here we have another proprietor,\r\nJohn Mordaunt, brought into connection with Coningsby, and that he was a\r\nman of substance was shewn by the fact that this recognition of his\r\nproperty was not confined to Coningsby, but extended to the manor of\r\nEstwardesbersoke, etc., in Notts.; the manors of Halton, Aukebarow, and\r\nBurton Stather; lands in Winterton, Theylby, Hybalstede, Barnaby, Eyrby,\r\nCrosby, Gunnall, Donyngton, etc.  Further, by Feet of Fynes, 21 Henry\r\nVII. (1505), an agreement is given between Richard, Bishop of Winchester,\r\nSir Giles Daubeney, of Daubeney, Knight; Sir T. Lovell, Sir R. Emson, Sir\r\nJames Hobart, _Humphrey Conyngesby_, one of the King’s Sergeants at Law,\r\nand others, as plaintiffs, and Robert Ratclyfe de Fitzwater, and Margaret\r\nRatclyfe, widow of Sir John Ratclyfe de Fitzwater, deforciants; whereby\r\nRobert and Margaret recognise the castle of Egremound, and various other\r\nmanors and properties, to be the right of the Bishop.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is known that the manor of Coningsby was formerly held by the\r\nMarmyons, and they and their descendants, the Dymokes, were largely\r\ncommemorated in stained-glass windows once existing in the church; and a\r\ntombstone records the “Hic jacet” of Anna, daughter of Thomas Dymoke, and\r\nhis wife “que obijt A° Dni 1462.”  The manorial rights ultimately passed\r\nto the Heathcotes, and are now the property of the head of that family,\r\nthe Earl of Ancaster.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the church; and, taking the exterior first, we are\r\nstruck by the fine tower, which is visible for many miles round.  It is\r\nof the Perpendicular order, very plain; indeed, almost without ornament,\r\nexcept for the roses on the cuspings of the upper window; but it is of\r\nsolid, good ashlar work, well supported by buttresses, and its outline\r\nrelieved by several set-offs.  It is pierced, below, by an arched\r\npassage, through which there is a public thoroughfare, existing from time\r\nimmemorial, {222} the supposition being, that the monks of Croyland and\r\nother southern monasteries, on their way to Kirkstead, and their more\r\nnorthern brethren, “baited” at the rectory hard by, where there are still\r\ntraces of a large refectory in the presence of an arch of wide span,\r\nwhich runs through the oldest part of the house, from top to bottom.  In\r\nthe east and west walls, on either side of this tower arch, is a\r\nsex-foiled, circular window; that on the east being in the west wall of\r\nthe nave, and filled with coloured glass; that on the west, being in the\r\noutside wall of the tower, has never been glazed.  In the south-eastern\r\nwall of the porch is a stoup, which formerly was open both within the\r\nporch and outside, though now it is closed outside.  Built into the west\r\nwall of the south aisle, probably at the restoration in 1872, is a block\r\nof stone, carved with a closed hand, having a finely-laced cuff.  This\r\nis, doubtless, an importation from elsewhere.  Near the top of the wall\r\nof a cupola-shaped south finial of the rood-loft turret, is an old\r\nsun-dial.  Taking now the interior, we find a massive heavy roof, of\r\nbeams somewhat rudely hewn, with traces of former colouring still\r\nperceptible.  The four western bays of the arcade are Early English, with\r\nlow arches rising from octagonal piers; the easternmost bay seems to have\r\nbeen an addition at a later date; some of the piers, two on the north and\r\none on the south, have been heightened, and the arches are higher and\r\nwider.  The moulding between two of the north arches terminates in a\r\nhead, on each side of which an evil spirit is whispering.  Another\r\nterminal is the head of a woman wearing the “branks,” or scold’s bridle.\r\n{223}  The clerestory windows were spoilt at the restoration, when their\r\nheight had to be reduced.  Externally their original design remains—two\r\nlancet windows over each arch; but internally the lancets have been cut\r\nshort and converted into triangular lights with curved sides.  On the\r\nsouth side of the chancel arch is a rood-loft staircase turret, of which\r\nboth the upper and lower doorways remain.  The chancel east end is\r\napsidal, modern, and out of keeping with the rest of the structure.\r\nThere are three two-light windows in the three faces of the apse.  In one\r\nof these the present rector, Canon Arthur Wright, has placed a two-light\r\nmemorial window, to his deceased wife, of some beauty.  South of the\r\nCommunion table, attached to the wall as a credence table, is an Early\r\nEnglish capital, with piscina behind.  The windows in the north aisle are\r\ndecorated with reticulated tracery.  Those of the south aisle are\r\nPerpendicular, with segmented heads.  The windows throughout the church,\r\nand extending even to the rectory house, were, at a former period,\r\nunusually rich in stained glass,\r\n\r\n    With varied hues all richly dight,\r\n    In radiance and collateral light,\r\n    Of knight’s and baron’s heraldic scroll,\r\n    And prayers invoked for manie a soule.\r\n\r\nThe marvel is, what has become of it, since there is no record of any act\r\nof spoliation such as is known to have been committed in the neighbouring\r\nchurch of Tattershall.  We give here extracts from Gervase Holles’ “Notes\r\non Churches,” descriptive of these windows, etc., from the Harleyan MSS.,\r\nNo. 6,829, as they are given in Weir’s “History,” pp. 50–52, ed. 1820.\r\n\r\n                     _In fenestra Orientali Cancelli_\r\n\r\nQuarterly                                                          Marmyon\r\n\r\nVerry a fesse G. fretty d’or\r\n\r\nSa. 2 lyons passant arg. crowned d’or\r\n\r\nEmpaled                                                             Dymoke\r\n\r\nG. a frett of 8 pieces d’or\r\n\r\nB.3 garbes d’or\r\n\r\nG. a lyon rampant d’or\r\n\r\nSa. a sword in pale arg\r\n\r\nSa. 3 lyons passant arg crowned d’or                                Dymoke\r\n\r\nArg, 3 flowres de lize between 6 crosse crosslets,                 Hillary\r\nfitchy sa. a border G.\r\n\r\nArg. a playne crosse G.\r\n\r\nG. a playne cross arg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Tumulus lapideus_.\r\n\r\n‘Hic jacet Anna fillla Thome Dymoke Militis D’ni . . .\r\net Margaretis consortis suæ que obijt A° Dni 1642 &c.\r\n\r\nEmpaled } Verry a fesse G. fretty d’or                             Marmyon\r\n\r\nEmpaled } Or a lyon rampant double queue sa                         Welles\r\n\r\n                     _In mure boreali aere sculptum_.\r\n\r\nOrate pro a’i’a M’ri Joh’is de Croxby quondam Rectoris istius ecclesiæ.\r\nqui dedit annualem redditum xxs annuatim in p’petuum, et in secunda,\r\nFeriæ primæ hebdommadæ quadragesimæ habitantibus in Conningsby sc’am\r\nformam evidentiæ suæ distribuendorum.\r\n\r\n“This charity hath ceased for many years, the evidence having been\r\nsacrilegiously stolen out of that monument within the wall, as by the\r\nloosening of the plate of brasse may appeare.\r\n\r\n               _In fenestra Occidentali Capellæ Orientalis_\r\n\r\nOrate pro a’iabus . .

In the centre of the nave\r\nare two slabs, once having had brasses, but these are no longer _in\r\nsitu_.  Over the porch is a parvis, as a priest’s chamber, or school.\r\nThe church has a clock and six bells.  The curfew, or _ignitegium_, was\r\nrung down to within the last thirty years.  Among the Rectors have been\r\ntwo poets, one of them the Laureate of his day (1718), the Rev. Laurence\r\nEusden, who died in 1730.  A man originally “of some parts,” by\r\ninordinate flattery he obtained that distinction, which, however, invited\r\ncriticism; and his mediocre abilities, accompanied by habits somewhat\r\nintemperate, provoked ridicule.  Among other productions, he translated\r\ninto Latin Lord Halifax’s poem on “The Battle of the Boyne.”  Pope refers\r\nto him, in his “Dunciad,” thus:—\r\n\r\n    Know, Eusden thirsts no more for sack or praise,\r\n       He sleeps among the dull of ancient days;\r\n          Safe, where no critics d---n, nor duns molest\r\n\r\nAnother writer says of him,\r\n\r\n    Eusden, a laurell’d bard, by fortune raised,\r\n    By very few men read, by fewer praised;\r\n\r\nwhile the Duke of Buckingham, describing, in a “skit,” the contest for\r\nthe Laureateship, says,\r\n\r\n    In rushed Eusden, and cryed, “Who shall have it?\r\n    But I, the true Laureate, to whom the king gave it?”\r\n    Apollo begged pardon, and granted his claim,\r\n    But vowed that till then he’d ne’er heard of his name.\r\n\r\nJohn Dyer, born 1700, was a much more reputable person.  He was educated\r\nat Westminster; began life as an itinerant artist, with a keen eye to the\r\nbeauties of nature, when that taste was little cultivated.  He was\r\nappointed to the rectory by Sir John Heathcote in 1752, and in 1755 to\r\nKirkby-on-Bain, for which he exchanged Belchford, where he had formerly\r\nbeen.  He was the author of “Grongar Hill,” “The Fleece,” and “The Ruins\r\nof Rome.”  He was honoured with a sonnet by Wordsworth; but his longer\r\npoems are somewhat wearisome reading.\r\n\r\nThe place-names in this parish indicate the condition of woodland and\r\nwaste which formerly prevailed.  Immediately south of the church and its\r\nsurroundings we find the “Ings,” or meadows, the Saxon term which we have\r\nnoticed in several other parishes.  Further off, we have “Oaklands” farm,\r\nand “Scrub-hill,” “scrub” being an old Lincolnshire word for a small\r\nwood; as we have, in the neighbourhood, ‘Edlington Scrubs’ and ‘Roughton\r\nScrubs.’  “Reedham,” another name, indicates a waste of morass.\r\n“Toot-hill” might be a raised ground from which a watch, or look-out, was\r\nkept, in troublous times; and Dr. Oliver says, in his “Religious Houses,”\r\nAppendix, p. 166, “‘Taut’ is a place of observation; ‘Touter’ is a\r\nwatcher in hiding;” but it is more likely to be from the Saxon “tot,” an\r\neminence (“totian,” to rise), in which case the second syllable, “hill,”\r\nis only a later translation of the first.  However, Toot-hill, Tothill,\r\nor Tooter’s hill, are not uncommon in other parts, and are said to have\r\nbeen connected with the heathen worship of Taith.  Langworth Grange, in\r\nthis parish, would probably be (as elsewhere) a corruption of Langwath,\r\nthe long ford over some of the fenny stretches of water.  The most\r\npeculiar place-name is “Troy-wood.”  It is possible that, as at\r\nHorncastle, this may have been a place where the youths gathered to play\r\nthe old game of “Troy town”; but is more likely of British origin, a\r\nremnant of the Fenland Grirvii.  Troy Town is a hamlet near Dorchester,\r\nbut there are several spots in Wales named Caer-troi, which means a\r\nbending, or tortuous town, a labyrinth, such as the Britons made with\r\nbanks of turf.\r\n\r\nWe have now about done with Coningsby.  We are welcome to enter the\r\nrectory, where we notice the large arch, already referred to, of the\r\nformer refectory.  Other objects of interest may be shewn us by the\r\nRector, but we turn to the western window of the drawing-room to gaze\r\nupon a sight unparalleled.  Not a mile away there rises up before us the\r\nstately structure of Tattershall Castle, “the finest piece of brickwork\r\nin the kingdom”; and, close by, beneath, as it were, its sheltering wing,\r\nthe collegiate church, almost, in its way, as grand an object.\r\n_L’appetit vient en mangeant_; and, as we devour the prospect, we hunger\r\nand thirst for a closer acquaintance with their attractions.\r\n\r\nLeaving Coningsby, and proceeding westward, we reach the bridge which\r\nspans the Horncastle canal.  Here we pause to turn round and take a look\r\nbehind us eastward.  The massive tower of Coningsby rises far above the\r\ntrees of the rectory precincts, themselves of a considerable height.\r\nLooking along the canal, the eye rests upon a very Dutch-like scene; the\r\nsleepy waters of the so-called “Navigation” fringed by tall elms growing\r\non its southern margin, and on its northern by decaying willows, studding\r\nthe meadows, which are richly verdant from the damp atmosphere which it\r\nengenders; a slowly-crawling barge or two might formerly have been seen,\r\nwith horse and driver on the towing path; but they are now things of the\r\npast.  The canal, on its opening in 1801, was expected to be a mine of\r\nwealth to the shareholder’s, but, having been ruined by the railway, it\r\nis now disused; in parts silted up and only a bed of water plants; in\r\nother parts its banks have given way, and the bed is dry.  Its only\r\npresent utility is to add picturesqueness to a scene of still life.\r\nFollowing the towing path westward, with the straggling street of\r\nTattershall on the other side of the water, we reach what is called a\r\n“staunch,” a weir, over which the surplus carnal water discharges itself\r\ninto what was the original channel of the river Bain, {228} which,\r\nbetween Horncastle and here, has been more than once utilised to\r\nreplenish the canal.  Not far off, down this small stream, are some\r\nfavourite haunts of the speckled trout; and beneath overhanging willows\r\nfine chub may be seen poising themselves in the water sleepily.  We now\r\nleave the towing path and enter the main street, with church and castle\r\nclose at hand to our left, but first we will go a hundred yards to the\r\nright, and make for the Marketplace.  By the gift of “a well-trained\r\nhawk,” Robert Fitz-Eudo, in 1201, obtained from King John a charter for\r\nholding a weekly market; and the shaft and broad base of the market\r\ncross, bearing the arms of Cromwell, Tateshall, and D’Eyncourt, with a\r\nmodern substitute for the cross on the top, still exists.  An old brick\r\nbuilding, in a yard on the south side of the Market-place, now used for\r\nmalting, is traditionally said to have been the original, and smaller,\r\nchurch, before the present one was erected in the 15th century.\r\n\r\nAs prefatory to our examination of both castle and church, we give here a\r\nbrief notice of the owners of this barony, and the founder of both these\r\nerections.  Among the Norman knights who accompanied the Conqueror in his\r\ngreat venture against Harold for the throne of England,—and we can hardly\r\nhelp reflecting on the vast deviation in the stream of English history\r\nwhich would have followed if that “bow drawn at a venture” had not sent a\r\nshaft through the eye and brain of Harold at Hastings,—there were, as\r\nCamden tells us, {229a} two sworn brothers in arms, Eudo and Pinso, to\r\nwhom William, as the reward of their prowess, assigned certain\r\nterritories, to be held by them in common, as they had themselves made\r\ncommon cause in has service.  They subsequently divided these\r\npossessions, and the Barony of Tattershall, with Tattershall Thorpe and\r\nother appendages,—among them two-thirds of Woodhall,—fell to the share of\r\nEudo.  He was succeeded, in due course, by his son, Hugh Fitz-Eudo,\r\nsurnamed Brito, or, the Breton; who, in 1139 founded a monastery for\r\nCistercian monks at Kirkstead.  The male line of this family continued\r\nfor some eight generations.  His grandson Philip died, when sheriff of\r\nthe county, in 1200; his great grandson Robert married, first, Lady\r\nMabel, eldest sister and co-heir of Hugh de Albini, {229b} 5th Earl of\r\nSussex and Arundel, represented now by the Dukes of Norfolk (Earls of\r\nArundel), hereditary Earl-Marshals and Chief Butlers of England; and,\r\nsecondly, a daughter of John de Grey.  This Robert obtained, in 1231,\r\npermission from Hen. III. to rebuild the family residence of stone.  As\r\nto this permission, it may be observed that castle-building had been\r\ncarried on so extensively in the reign of Stephen, and the powerful\r\nbarons, backed by their fortified residences, had proved themselves so\r\nformidable, that it was deemed politic to prevent further erections of\r\nthis kind, except with the Royal licence. {229c}  This would be the first\r\nsubstantially-fortified structure at this place, but of this building\r\nthere is not now left one stone upon another; views, however, of the\r\ncastle, drawn by Buck, in 1727, shew that there were then remaining\r\nextensive buildings, whose style would seen to correspond with the date\r\nof this licence.  This Robert, having married two wives, who were\r\nheiresses, would be a wealthy and important personage; he died in 1249.\r\nTwo more Roberts succeeded in their turn; the second of them being\r\nsummoned to Parliament, as 1st Baron de Tateshall, in 1297, died in the\r\nyear following.  On the death of his grandson, another Robert, and 3rd\r\nBaron, without issue, in 1305, the estates reverted to his three aunts,\r\nEmma, Joan, and Isabella, the second of whom, married to Robert de Driby,\r\ninherited Tattershall.  Their two sons dying, the property again reverted\r\nto a female, viz., their daughter Alice, married to Sir William Bernak,\r\nLord of Woodthorp, co. Lincoln, who died 1339.  His son, Sir John Bernak,\r\nmarried Joan, daughter and co-heir of Robert, 2nd Baron Marmyon, who died\r\n1345; and, on the death of his two sons, the property, for a third time,\r\npassed to a female, in the person of his daughter Maude, who married Sir\r\nRalph Cromwell.  He was summoned to Parliament as Baron Cromwell in 1375,\r\nand died in 1398.  His grandson, the 3rd Baron, also a Ralph, married\r\nMargaet, sister and co-heir of William, last Baron D’Eyncourt.  These\r\nseveral marriages with heiresses had largely augmented the estates and\r\nwealth of the successive families, and this Ralph, being made Lord\r\nTreasurer in 1433 by Henry VI., levelled the older castle to the ground,\r\nand, having obtained the Royal licence to rebuild, he erected the present\r\nmajestic pile in 1440, at a cost, as William of Worcester informs us,\r\n{230} of 4,000 marks.  At this palatial residence, and in London, he\r\nlived in great state, his household consisting of 100 persons, and his\r\nsuite, when he rode to London, commonly comprised 120 horsemen; his\r\nannual expenditure being £5,000.  In a previous chapter we quoted a\r\ncharge made upon Lord Clinton, when living at Tattershall, for 1,000\r\nfaggots.  At Hurstmonceux Castle, a similar building to Tattershall, the\r\noven is described by Dugdale (“Beauties of England—Sussex,” p. 206) as\r\nbeing 14ft. long.  In such a furnace the daily consumption of faggots\r\nwould not be a trifle.\r\n\r\nTo speak here for a moment of building in brick.  From the ordinarily\r\nunsightly character of brick structures it is usual to regard\r\nbrick-building disparagingly, but we have only to go to Italy, the\r\nhereditary land of Art in various forms, to see edifices unsurpassed for\r\nbeauty in the world, which are constructed wholly, or in part, of brick.\r\nThe Cathedral at Cremona, with its delicately-moulded Rose windows and\r\nits Torrazo, 400ft. in height; those of St. Pantaleone, Pavia; of the\r\nBroletto, Brescia; or the Ducal Palace at Mantua, with its rich windows;\r\nor the Palazzo dei Signori at Verona, with tower 300ft. high; not to\r\nmention more, are all splendid specimens of what can be achieved in\r\nbrick.  In England, nothing like these has ever been attempted; the only\r\nmodern church of brick worth a mention is that of All Saints, Margaret\r\nStreet, London, with its graceful spire.  In the 15th century, and\r\nslightly earlier, a few substantial and finely-constructed erections of\r\nbrick were made, of which one of the earliest, if not the earliest, was\r\nthe magnificent Gate Tower of Layer Marney in Essex, built by the 1st\r\nLord Marney, and for which he is said to have imported Italian workmen\r\nfor the moulded bricks.  Owing to his death the entire structure was not\r\ncompleted.  But the gateway, flanked by two octagonal towers, each of\r\neight stories; and the summit, chimneys and divisions of windows, with\r\ntheir varied mouldings, are a very fine piece of work. {231a}  Another of\r\nthese brick structures, of about the same date, was Torksey Castle, in\r\nour own county; another was Hurstmonceux Castle, in Sussex, said by\r\nDugdale {231b} to be the only one at all rivalling Tattershall; while, by\r\na curious coincidence, its founder was Sir Roger de Fiennes, one of the\r\nfamily, which, at a later period, owned Tattershall.\r\n\r\nAs we stand before Tattershall Castle and gaze on its stately\r\nproportions, we cannot but feel that brick, properly, treated, can rival\r\nstone.  What remains now is probably barely a third of what the building\r\noriginally was, and stands, doubtless, on the site previously occupied by\r\nthe Keep of the earlier castle.  It is a type of a particular stage of\r\nconstruction, when the palace was superseding the grim feudal fortress,\r\nalthough retaining several of the warlike features.  Besides an inner\r\nmoat, completely surrounding the castle, there was also an outer one,\r\nprotecting it on the north and west. {231c}  Both these moats were\r\nsupplied with water from the river Bain, and they had an inter-connection\r\nby a cut on the north side of the castle, close by which there was a\r\nsmall machicolated tower, probably connected with a drawbridge.  On the\r\nspace between the moats were buildings detached, serving for barracks,\r\nguardrooms, etc., and one of these, now used as a barn, opposite the\r\nnorth-west angle of the castle, is still fairly perfect.  The entrance to\r\nthe inner castle court, on the north-east, was defended by a lofty\r\ngateway, with portcullis, and flanked by two turrets, which were still\r\nremaining when Buck’s drawings were made, in 1727.  This noble keep, in\r\nTreasurer Cromwell’s time, had at least five groups of noble buildings\r\nabout it; so that we can now hardly conceive the imposing appearance of\r\nthe whole.  What remains is 89ft. in length, by 67ft. in width, rising\r\nboldly into the air, slightly sloping inwards as it rises, to give a\r\ngreater idea of height, until its turret parapets are found to be 112ft.\r\nfrom the ground; while its massive walls, the eastern one 16ft. thick at\r\nthe base, are in keeping with its large proportions.  The variety of\r\noutline in the well-set windows, the shadow-casting angle turrets, and\r\nthe massive machicolations, all serve to relieve the structure of\r\nmonotony.  The red bricks, too, are varied by having others of a dark\r\ngrey tint introduced in reticulated patterns, which relieve without being\r\nobtrusive.  As I have observed elsewhere, a geologist of experience\r\nstates that both the bricks and the locally-termed grouting, or mortar,\r\nare alike made from local material. {232}  The covered gallery on the\r\nsummit of the keep, surrounded by battlements, pierced with windows, and\r\npartly pendent over the machicolations, though said to be unique in this\r\ncountry, is a feature not uncommon in France and Germany.  The internal\r\narrangement of four grand apartments, one above another, is similar to\r\nthat of Kirkby Muxloe, but it is now difficult to assign to them their\r\nparticular uses.  Nothing remains of these apartments beyond their\r\nwindows, three beautiful stone mantelpieces, and two or three massive oak\r\nbauk-beams.  Of one of the latter, now gone, the writer has a rather\r\ngruesome recollection.  In the reckless hardihood of youth, there were\r\nfew parts of the castle which were not reached by himself and his not\r\nless daring companions; and, in a moment of heedless adventure, on\r\njackdaws’ eggs intent, he walked across one of these beams from the\r\neastern gallery to the western wall, with nothing but empty space between\r\nhim and the ground, 70 or 80 feet below.  He performed this feat safely,\r\nbut a few days afterwards the beam fell.  At that time, in the forties,\r\n{233} three of the corner turrets had conical roofs covered with lead.\r\nThe writer’s name was cut in the lead of the most inaccessible of these,\r\nas well as on several other places, still to be seen.  The lead has been\r\nsold, and the roofs removed, long ago.  Within these roofs was a\r\ncomplicated network of supporting beams, crossing and re-crossing each\r\nother, among which pigeons, and even owls, nested.  A schoolfellow of the\r\nwriter clambered up into one of these, bent on plunder, but the beams\r\nwere too rotten to bear his weight, and he fell to the floor, some 15 or\r\n18 feet, on to the hard bricks.  No bones, fortunately, were broken, but\r\nhe sustained such a shock that he was confined to his bed for some weeks.\r\nBut a more remarkable escape occurred at a later date.  Visiting the\r\ncastle, a dozen or more yeans ago, while the writer was looking down to\r\nthe basement from the topmost gallery, close to the foot of the small\r\nstaircase which leads to the flat roof of the south-eastern turret, the\r\nson of a farmer in the parish came up to him and said, in the most\r\nunconcerned manner, “Sir, my brother fell from here to the bottom\r\nyesterday.”  I replied, with surprise, “Was he not killed on the spot?”\r\n“No,” was the answer, “he was only a little shaken.”  The boy, probably\r\nabout 10 or 11 years old, was wearing a smock frock, loose below, but\r\nfastened fairly tight about the neck.  In search of eggs, I presume, he\r\nsprang across the open space below him, from the eastern gallery to a\r\nledge running along the south wall, but, in attempting to do this, his\r\nshoulder struck the brickwork of the corner turret, which spun him round,\r\nand he fell.  His smock frock, however, filled with air, and buoyed him\r\nup, thus checking the rapidity of his descent, and he alighted on the\r\nground upon a heap of small sticks and twigs dropped by the jackdaws, and\r\nthe result was little more than a severe shaking.  We have noticed the\r\nhandsome mantelpieces, which are referred to and engraved in several\r\npublications.  They are ornamented with the Treasurer’s purse and the\r\nmotto “N’ai j’ droit,” and other heraldic devices of the Tattershall,\r\nDriby, Bernak, Cromwell, D’Eyncourt, Grey of Rotherfield, and Marmyon\r\nfamilies, a study for the genealogist.  Nor may we forget the vaulted\r\ngallery on the third floor, with bosses of cement and beautifully-moulded\r\nbrickwork in its roof.  This fine old ruin has not only suffered from the\r\nravages of time, but the elements have also played havoc with it.  On\r\nMarch 29, 1904, at 2.30 p.m., in a violent thunderstorm, it was struck by\r\nlightning.  The “bolt” fell on the north-east corner tower, hurling to\r\nthe ground, inside and outside, massive fragments of the battlemented\r\nparapet.  The electric fluid then passed downward, through the building,\r\nemerging by a window of the third storey, in the western side, tearing\r\naway several feet of masonry, and causing a great rent in the solid wall\r\nbeneath.  The writer inspected the damage within a few days of the\r\noccurrence, and was astonished at the violence of the explosion.\r\n\r\nAfter the extinction of the Cromwell line the estates probably reverted\r\nto the Crown, as we find that Henry VII. granted the manor of\r\nTattershall, and other properties, to his mother, Margaret, Countess of\r\nRichmond; and in the following year he entailed them on the Duke.  On the\r\nDuke dying without issue, Henry VIII., in 1520, granted these properties\r\nto Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, by letters patent, which were\r\nconfirmed by Ed. VI. in the year 1547.  On the deaths of the two infant\r\nsons of the Duke, shortly after the father’s decease, Ed. VI., in 1551,\r\ngranted the estate to Edward, Lord Clinton and Saye, afterwards Earl of\r\nLincoln, whose descendant, Edward, died without issue in 1692, when the\r\nproperty passed to his cousin Bridget, who married Hugh Fortescue, Esq.,\r\nwhose son Hugh was created Baron Fortescue and Earl Clinton in 1746; and\r\nthe estates have continued in that family ever since.\r\n\r\nWe now pass to the church.  As the castle was a sample of transition from\r\nthe feudal fortress to the baronial palace, so the church, although of\r\nthe Perpendicular order, is not quite of the purest type, being of the\r\nlater Perpendicular period.  Begun by the Treasurer Cromwell, it was not\r\ncompleted at his death in 1455, but the work was carried on and finished\r\nby his executors, one of whom was William of Wykeham, Bishop of\r\nWinchester, the most famous building prelate of his time.  It has been\r\nnoticed, by competent judges, that there is “a remarkable resemblance in\r\npoints of detail, in the churches built or enlarged by Ralph, Lord\r\nCromwell, at Colly Weston, Northants; Lambley, Notts.; and Tattershall,”\r\nas is the case with other groups of edifices erected by the same parties.\r\n(“Archæolog. Journ.,” No. 12, 1846, pp. 291–2.)  It was established as a\r\ncollegiate institution, with provision for a provost, six priests, six\r\nsecular clerks, and six choristers.  Dedicated to the Trinity, it is a\r\nnoble stone structure, in shape cruciform, with nave, aisles, and north\r\nand south transepts, chancel, north and south porches, and tower at the\r\nwest end.  There were formerly cloisters on the south side, but they were\r\ndemolished.  The tower is supported by buttresses, having six breaks\r\nreaching to the base of the embattled parapet, and angle pinnacles, with\r\na square-headed west door; on the whole it is rather heavy.  The best\r\nexternal feature of the church is the clerestory.  Internally the nave\r\nhas six lofty bays with very slender pillars and a low-pitched roof.  It\r\nis very spacious.  It has been recently supplied with chairs, and the old\r\npulpit revived.  But for many years the chancel was the only part used\r\nfor services, and, indeed, as regards accommodation, the only part\r\nneeded.  The chancel is separated from the nave by a very unusual\r\narrangement,—a massive stone rood screen, the upper part of which was,\r\nsome years ago, used as the singing gallery; and a former old female\r\nverger used to refer, with keen enthusiasm, to the time when, under the\r\nlate Mr. Richard Sibthorpe’s ministrations (whose perversions and\r\nreversions between Romanism and Anglicanism were, at the least,\r\nremarkable), this gallery reverberated with the inspiring strains of the\r\nfiddle, the trombone, the hautboy, the clarionet (“harp, sackbut,\r\npsaltery, and dulcimer”), and other kinds of music, to the hearty\r\nenjoyment of all.  This massive screen was the gift of a member of the\r\ncollegiate body, one Robert de Whalley, in 1528.  Little survives of the\r\noriginal choir but some stalls and sedilia.  In the north transept,\r\nremoved, for preservation, from their original positions, are some of the\r\nfinest brasses in the county; only half, however, of the once very fine\r\nbrass of the Treasurer Cromwell and his wife remains, remarkable for the\r\nape-like “wild men” on which his feet rest; and in the course of years,\r\nsince Gervase Holles wrote his “Notes on Churches” (1642), no less than\r\n14 brasses have disappeared, and only 7 now remain.  Gough, in his\r\naccount, says that, on the brass of Maud Willoughby (1497), one of the\r\nsmall figures, with book and keys, at the side is inscribed “Sta Scytha.”\r\nSt. Osyth was the daughter of Frewald, a Mercian prince, was born at\r\nQuarrenden, Bucks., and became the virgin wife of an East Anglian king.\r\nShe is a saint not often mentioned.  “Sithe Lane (says Stow the\r\nhistorian) at the east end of Watling Street, London, is known as St.\r\nScythe’s Lane, so called of St. Sithe’s church.” {236}  The windows of\r\nthis church were originally filled with beautiful stained glass of the\r\nPerpendicular period, much of which survived the barbarism of the\r\nCommonwealth, only to be removed by Earl Fortescue in 1757, and presented\r\nto the Earl of Exeter for St. Martin’s church in Stamford, where some of\r\nit may still be seen, more or less damaged by transit.  This spoliation\r\nso enraged the parishioners that they, with some justification, raised a\r\nriot to prevent it; and the glass was only, it is said, got away under\r\ncover of night.  For 50 years afterwards the windows of the chancel\r\nremained unglazed, and being thus exposed to the weather, the finely\r\ncarved oak stalls, rich screens, and other ornamental work, fell into a\r\nstate of decay.  The chancel was restored several years ago, and fitted\r\nup in a neat, plain manner by the present Lord Fortescue, at a cost of\r\n£800, £1,000 being further spent on the nave.  Some very interesting\r\nfragments of the old glass were collected, and they are now chiefly in\r\nthe east window.  In both transepts are piscinas, shewing that they were\r\nformerly used as chapels.  The north transept was enriched by Edward\r\nHevyn, the agent of Margaret Countess of Richmond, as was evidenced by “a\r\nfayre marble within it,” when Holles visited the church, bearing this\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n    Have mercy on ye soule, good Lord, we thee pray\r\n    Of Edward Hevyn, laid here in sepulture.\r\n    Which, to their honour, this chappell did array\r\n    With ceiling, deske, perclose, portrayture,\r\n    And pavement of marble long to endure\r\n    Servant of late to the excellent Princess,\r\n    Mother of King Henry, of Richmond Countess.\r\n\r\nAs this is not intended to be a complete guide to the church, and all its\r\nbeauties, but rather to whet the appetite of the visitor to investigate\r\nthem further for himself, I shall only make some detailed remarks upon\r\nthe brass of Lord Treasurer Cromwell and his wife, which, while entire,\r\nwas a fine typical specimen.  A good engraving of it, from a drawing\r\npreserved at Revesby Abbey and made for Sir Joseph Banks, is given in\r\n“Lincolnshire Notes & Queries” (vol. iii., p. 193); a description is also\r\ngiven there, taken, it would seem, from the “Notes” of Gervase Holles, as\r\nfollows:—Cromwell, with hands in prayer, is in armour of plain cuirass,\r\nwith very short skirt of ‘taces,’ to the lower end of which are strapped\r\na pair of ‘tuiles,’ or thigh-pieces, pendent over the cuisses\r\ngenouillieres, jointed with mail, and having edged plates fastened to\r\nthem above and below, long pointed ‘sollerets’ of plate armour, and\r\nrowell spurs, very large condieres, cuffed gauntlets of overlapping\r\nplates, with little scales to protect each finger separately; sword\r\nhanging from his waist in front by a strap; over all a mantle, once\r\nthought to be that of the Order of the Garter, but now supposed to be the\r\nofficial robe of Lord Treasurer, reaching to the ground behind, and\r\nfastened by cords which spring from rose-like ornaments, with long\r\npendent tasselled ends.  The support of the feet are two “Wodehowses,” or\r\nhairy wild men, armed with clubs.  On the remaining portion of the canopy\r\npier, on the right, is the figure of St. Peter, in a cope, wearing the\r\ntiara, a key in his left hand and a crozier in the right, with canopied\r\nniche.  In another, above, is a figure of St. Maurice, in armour of the\r\n15th century, in his right hand a halbert, and in his left a sword.\r\nCorresponding with these, on the left, is a figure of St. George, in\r\nsimilar armour, thrusting his lance into the dragon’s mouth.  Above is\r\nthe figure of St. Cornelius, holding a bannered spear in his left hand,\r\nand a sword in his right.  The lost saints were on the right, St.\r\nBarbara, St. Hubert, and another, not known; on the left, St. Thomas of\r\nCanterbury, the Virgin, St. John Baptist, St. Anne with the Virgin\r\nkneeling, and a Saint with short spear and ring, probably Edward the\r\nConfessor.  Beneath the two wild men is the inscription:—\r\n\r\n    Hic jacet nobilis Baro, Radulphus Cromwell,\r\n    Miles, dux de Cromwell, quondam Thesaurius Angliæ, et\r\n    Fundator hujus collegii, cum inclita consorte sua,\r\n    Una herede dni Dayncourt, qui quidm\r\n    Radulphus obiit quarto die mens Januarii, ano dni\r\n    Milio CCCC, et p’dicta Margaretta obiit xv die\r\n    Septebv, ano dni milio CCCC quor. aiab. p. piture Deus.  Amen.\r\n\r\nMen rest from their labours, and their works do follow them.  The founder\r\nhas passed away, and the college also is no more; and the once\r\nrichly-endowed benefice is now little better than a starveling.  But the\r\nhumble Bede-houses, connected with the college, still remain.\r\n\r\nOne only further record can we give of Tattershall.  Most places have had\r\ntheir characters.  Tradition avers, and not so long ago either, that a\r\ncertain worthy farmer, living in the neighbourhood, used to ride into\r\nTattershall, almost nightly, to his hostel, to play his game of cards\r\nwith certain boon companions.  It was before our toll-bars were\r\nabolished, and there stood, near Tattershall bridge, a toll-bar with gate\r\nmade formidable by a chevaux de frise of iron spikes.  At times the play\r\nran high, and our friend would return home without a coin in his pocket\r\nwherewith to pay toll.  But he was well-mounted, and on a moonlight night\r\nhe would not hesitate to obviate the difficulty by taking the toll-bar at\r\nfull speed and landing safely on four legs beyond it.  Although I cannot\r\nset my seal to this tradition, yet, from the style in which he would\r\nfollow the hounds, I can well believe that not even a toll-bar, spikes\r\nand all, would debar him from his “long clay” and glass of wholesome\r\n“home-brewed” by his own fireside as a “night-cap.” {238}\r\n\r\nWe now bid adieu to Tattershall, prepared, presumably, to endorse the\r\nverdict of a writer in the “Quarterly Review,” that the castle is indeed\r\n“the finest redbrick tower in the kingdom,” {239a} and the best example,\r\nexcept, perhaps, Hurstmonceux, of what good brickwork is capable of in\r\narchitecture; and, further, that the church is not unworthy of a place\r\nbeside it; and it is not a little remarkable that William of Waynfleet,\r\nwho completed it, also built the most beautiful college in the world,\r\nviz., that of Magdalen, Oxford.\r\n\r\nOur itinerary is now approaching its conclusion, yet we shall finish with\r\na _bonne bouche_.  We turn our faces northward, and, passing by land\r\nstill called “Tattershall park,” though now under cultivation and broken\r\nup into fields; and, where formerly were two ancient encampments, British\r\nor Roman, but now obliterated, a walk of some three miles brings us in\r\nview of a tall fragment of stone-work, two fields distant on our left.\r\nThis is the last remaining portion of Kirkstead Abbey.  It is now some 50\r\nfeet high and 18 feet, or so, in width, but an engraving by Buck gives it\r\nas at least double that width; and the writer has conversed with a man\r\nwhose father was labouring in the Abbey field when he noticed some\r\ncattle, which had been standing under the shade of the ruin, suddenly\r\ngalloping away in alarm, and immediately afterwards a large portion of\r\nthe stonework collapsed, and, with a loud crash, fell to the ground,\r\nleaving the relic much about the size which we see now.\r\n\r\nThere are mounds and hollows about the Abbey field which show how\r\nextensive the buildings at one time were, covering several acres; and a\r\ncanal can be traced which had connection with the River Witham, which is\r\ntwo fields distant. {239b}  We here give a brief account of the Abbey.\r\nThe manor of Kirkstead was given by the Conqueror, along with that of\r\nTattershall, as above stated, to the Norman soldier, Eudo; and his son,\r\nHugh Fitz-Eudo, surnamed Brito, founded here a Cistercian monastery, in\r\n1139, dedicated to the Virgin.  The Abbey was very richly endowed from\r\nmore than one source.  The Harleyan MSS. (144) give a full account of its\r\npossessions (29 Henry VIII.).  Its lands were situated in the city of\r\nLincoln, and in Horncastle, Nocton, Blankney, Branston, Metheringham,\r\nCanwick, Sheepwash, Billingham, Thimbleby (where the Abbot had gallows),\r\nLangton, Coningsby, South Langton, Scampton, Holton, Thornton, Stretton,\r\nWispington, Strutby, Martin, Sudthorpe, Roughton, Haltham, Benniworth,\r\nHedingley, Woodhall (with the advowson), Wildmore Fen (45,000 acres),\r\netc., besides property in the parishes of St. Andrew, Holborn, St.\r\nBotolph, Aldersgate, and St. Nicholas, in the city of London; and the\r\nfurther advowsons of the benefices of Covenham and Thimbleby.  The Abbots\r\nexercised the rights of hunting, fowling and fishing; an old Cartulary of\r\nthe Abbey {240a} states that “Robert son of Simon de Driby . . . grants\r\nto the Abbot of Kirkstead to have their ‘mastiffs’ in his warren of Tumby\r\nall times of the year, with their shepherds, to take and retake their\r\nbeasts in the said warren, without any contradiction of the said Robert\r\nor his heirs.”  “Witness Robert, son of Walter de Tatessal.”  The demesne\r\nin Wildmore was granted to the Abbey by Baron Robert Marmyon of\r\nScrivelsby, and William de Romara, Earl of Lincoln, jointly, on condition\r\nthat he should not allow any other parties to pasture on the lands, but\r\nonly themselves and their tenants. {240b}  This William de Romara also\r\nfounded the Abbey of Revesby in the 8th year of Stephen, and both to that\r\nAbbey and to Kirkstead he granted a Hermitage in Wildmore; and to show\r\nthe power of the Abbots of Kirkstead, it is recorded that when, in course\r\nof time, Ralph de Rhodes, “the Lord of Horncastle,” succeeded to the\r\nmanorial rights in Wildmore, he, contrary to the grants of his\r\npredecessors, “did bring in the said Wildmore other men’s cattell”;\r\nthereupon a plea of covent was sued against him by the Abbot of\r\nKirkstead, with the result that a “fyne” was acknowledged by the said\r\n“Ralfe de Rhodes.”  Similarly, a Marmyon, successor of the one who made\r\nthe grant, “contrary to the graunt of his ancestors, did bring into\r\nWildmore other men’s cattell, whereupon a like plea of covent was sued\r\nagainst him.”  And in both these cases these secular lords had to yield\r\nto the Abbot.  “From which time,” the old Record states, “the said Abbots\r\nhave bene Lords of Wildmore, and peaceably and quietly have enjoyed the\r\nsame as true Lords thereof, without impedimte of any man.” {240c}\r\n\r\nThese successes, however, seem to have elated the spirit of the Abbots of\r\nthis monastery, and to have led them, in the pride of power, not always\r\nto have due regard for the rights of others.  As early as the reign of\r\nEdward I., it was complained, before Royal Commissioners, that the Abbot\r\nwas guilty of sundry encroachments; that he obstructed passengers on the\r\nKing’s highway; {241a} that he made ditches for his own convenience which\r\nflooded his neighbours’ lands; and that, from his power, inferior parties\r\ncould get no redress; {241b} that he prevented the navigation of the\r\nWitham by any vessels but his own; {241c} that he trespassed on the\r\nKing’s prerogative by seizing “waifs and strays” over the whole of\r\nWildmore; {241d} that he had hanged various offenders at Thimbleby; had\r\nappropriated to himself, without licence, the assize of bread and beer.\r\n{241e}  Further, he refused to pay, on certain lands, the impost called\r\n“Sheriff’s aid,” {241f} or to do suit and service for his land, either in\r\nthe King’s Court or that of the Bishop of Carlisle at Horncastle. {241g}\r\nAgainst none of which charges does it appear that he returned any\r\nsatisfactory answer.  Yet, while thus acting with a high hand, he was not\r\nabove worldly traffic on a considerable scale, as is shewn by certain\r\nPatent Rolls, {241h} where a note is given to the effect that, on May\r\n1st, 1285, a licence was granted, at Westminster, for three years, “for\r\nthe Abbot of Kirkstead to buy wool throughout the county of Lincoln, in\r\norder to satisfy certain merchants, to whom he is bound in certain sacks\r\nof wool, his own sheep having failed through murrain;” while it was\r\nfurther alleged that he carried on an extensive system of smuggling,\r\nwhereby it was calculated that some £2,000 a year were lost to the\r\ncorporation of Lincoln.  Proceedings like these do not give us a very\r\nfavourable impression as to the virtues of these spiritual lords, their\r\ncharity, or their standard of morality.  Yet, on the other hand, we have\r\nto make allowance for the times and circumstances in which they lived.  I\r\nquote here a letter written by a Lincolnshire man who had viewed matters\r\nfrom the different standpoints of an Anglican and a Romanist. {241i}\r\n“You say ‘the monks were not saints.’  I have no doubt but a small\r\nproportion were.  Yet, taking them as a whole, the wonder is they were as\r\nrespectable as they were.  It is not enough considered what the monastic\r\nlife was for several centuries.  It was the refuge of hundreds and\r\nthousands who could find no other occupation.  There was no Navy as a\r\nprofession; the Army was not, in the sense we understand it, a\r\nprofession.  Law and medicine were very restricted.  What were men to do\r\nwith themselves?  How to pass life?  Where to go to live?  There was next\r\nto no education, no books hardly to read.  How can we wonder that the\r\nmass of monks were a very common kind of men, professedly very religious,\r\nof necessity formally so, but taking their duties as lightly as they\r\ncould?  The number of them who outraged their vows was wonderfully small.\r\nThe Inquisitions of Henry VIII.’s time, atrociously partial, as they\r\nwere, to find blame, found comparatively little.  Compare the monks of\r\nthose days with the Fellows of Colleges in the last (18th) century, and\r\ndown almost to our own day.  Were the former much lower in morals, if at\r\nall?  Less religious, if at all?  I think not.”  Nor should we forget\r\ntheir unbounded hospitality, in an age when there were few inns for the\r\ntraveller, and no Poor Law for the destitute; their skill in horticulture\r\nand agriculture, which were a national benefit; or their maintenance of\r\nroads and bridges; apart from their guardianship of the Scriptures, and\r\ntheir witness to Christianity.  It has been said, “From turret and tower\r\nsounded the well-known chime, thrice a day, to remind the faithful of the\r\nIncarnation, and its daily thrice-repeated memorial” (F. G. Lee,\r\n“Pilgrimage of Grace”).  The poor were never forgotten in these\r\nmultiplied services.  When mass was celebrated, it was a rule that the\r\nsacristan rang the “sanctus” bell (from its cherished sanctity often the\r\nonly bell still preserved in our village churches), “so that the rustics\r\nwho could not be present might everywhere, in field or home, be able to\r\nbow the knee to reverence” (Maskell’s “Ancient Liturgy,” p. 95.\r\n“Constit.,” J. Peckham, A.D. 1281).  If the strict rules of their\r\ncontinuous services were occasionally relaxed by exhilarating sport, or\r\neven, as the monks of Kirkstead are said to have done, by frequenting\r\nfairs, as at Horncastle, their abbots presiding at the pastimes of the\r\npeople, {242} the Maypole processions and dances; or getting up\r\nmystery-plays, or other exhibitions, perpetuated still at Nuremberg,\r\nwhere our most cultivated Christians go to witness them; surely these\r\nwere comparatively harmless recreations.  It must, however, be recognised\r\nthat, in time, prosperity had its usual corrupting effects.  The\r\nAukenleck MS. (temp. Ed. II.) says, “these Abbots and Priors do again\r\ntheir rights.  They ride with hawk and hounds, and counterfeit knights.”\r\nAs the Bishop of Ely attended divine service, leaving his hawk on its\r\nperch in the cloister, where it was stolen, and he solemnly\r\nexcommunicated the thief; or as the Bishop of Salisbury was reprimanded\r\nfor hunting the King’s deer; or as Bishop Juxon was so keen a sportsman\r\nthat he was said to have the finest pack of hounds in the kingdom; {243a}\r\nso the Abbott of Bardney had his hunting box, and the Abbots of Kirkstead\r\nexcluded others from sporting on their demesnes, that they might reserve\r\nthe enjoyment for themselves.  It is stated by Hallam (“History of the\r\nMiddle Ages”) that, in 1321, “the Archbishop of York carried a train of\r\n200 persons, maintained at the expense of the monasteries, on his road,\r\nand that he hunted with a pack of hounds, from parish to parish”; and\r\nsuch an example would naturally be contagious.  But it was only when\r\nlong-continued indulgence and immunity had pampered them to excess, that\r\nlaxity of morals became flagrant or general.  And even when of this very\r\nKirkstead it is recorded that, at the time of the Dissolution, the Abbot,\r\nRichard Haryson (1535) was fain to confess, in the deed of surrender,\r\nthat the monks had, “under the shadow of their rule, vainly detestably,\r\nand ungodlily devoured their yearly revenues in continual ingurgitations\r\nof their carrion bodies, and in support of their over voluptuous and\r\ncarnal appetites.” {243b}  We cannot but suspect that such language was\r\nthat of their enemies, put into their mouths, when resistance was no\r\nlonger possible.  They had, however, through long ages, acquired a\r\npowerful hold on the respect and affection of the people, and there were\r\nhundreds and thousands who were ready to say, what one once said of his\r\ncountry,\r\n\r\n    England! with all thy faults, I love thee still. {244a}\r\n\r\nThat the many virtues and the value of the monasteries came to be\r\nrecognised by many after they were abolished is shewn by the “Pilgrimage\r\nof Grace,” and similar indications of smouldering discontent among the\r\npeople whom they had long benefited.  Yet there was always the danger\r\narising from the perfunctory observance of multiplied services, that the\r\n“opus operatum” might oust the living faith; and there can be little\r\ndoubt that such a result had largely come about.  Though greed and\r\nplunder were the main motive of the Royal Executioner and his agents, the\r\nparties who suffered had certainly become only fitting subjects for\r\ndrastic measures.  But we pass from this digressive disquisition to the\r\none interesting relic of Kirkstead Abbey which is still spared to us, in\r\nthe little chapel standing in the fields, with reference to which I will\r\nhere quote the words of a writer to whom I have referred before. {244b}\r\nHe says, “A mile away from Woodhall is one of the loveliest little gems\r\nof architecture in the country, a pure, little, Early English church, now\r\ndreadfully dilapidated, which belonged, in some unexplained way,—probably\r\nas a chantry chapel,—to the Cistercian Abbey of Kirkstead.”  As this\r\nlittle gem is now locked away from public view, I will here give extracts\r\nfrom the description of it given by the late Bishop Suffragan, Dr. Edwd.\r\nTrollope, one of our greatest authorities, on the occasion of the\r\nArchitectural Society’s visit to it a few years ago; and which was handed\r\nto me by him at the time.  They are worthy of careful examination.\r\n\r\n“The situation of this lovely little chapel, on the south side of the\r\nAbbey of Kirkstead, and without its precincts, is most remarkable.  It\r\nhas been surmised that it may have served as the Abbot’s private chapel,\r\nor for the use of the Abbey tenants; but I can scarcely think that either\r\nof these suggestions is likely to be true, as such a chapel, so far from\r\nthe monastic building, and without its protecting girdle, would not have\r\nbeen convenient for the Abbot’s use, and such an elaborately-ornamented\r\nstructure would scarcely have been erected simply for the monastic\r\nchurls.  Had it been nearer the other buildings, and especially the great\r\nAbbey church, we might have thought it had served as the Chapter-House,\r\non which much pains was always bestowed by the Cistercians, so that, in\r\nrichness of design, this usually ranked second only to the church itself.\r\nI am inclined, however, to suggest that it was a chantry chapel, put\r\nunder the protection of the Abbey and served by its inmates according to\r\nthe Will of one of the former wealthy lords of Tattershall and Kirkstead,\r\nwhose burial place it eventually became.\r\n\r\n“This beautiful little structure consists of an unbroken oblong,\r\nsupported by plain buttresses, insufficient to shore up its side walls\r\nand bear the weight of its vaulted roof.  A plain plinth constitutes the\r\nfooting of the structures, above which is a bold boutel string, below the\r\nwindow sills, and it is surmounted by quarter round corbels which\r\noriginally supported a corbel table and a higher pitched roof than the\r\npresent one, not long ago (in the forties), covered with thatch.  The\r\nside windows consist of very narrow little lancets.  At the east end is a\r\ntriplet, and at the west end structural ornaments of a most beautiful\r\nkind have been most lavishly supplied.  Owing to the loss of the gables\r\nof this chapel, and its present hipped roof, its appearance at a distance\r\ndoes not promise much, but, when approached, the remarkable beauty of its\r\ndesign, and especially of its western elevation, will most assuredly\r\ncommand admiration.\r\n\r\n“From its own architectural evidence we may safely assume that it was\r\nbuilt during the first quarter of the 13th century, and it nearly\r\nresembles the contemporary work in the north transept of Lincoln\r\nCathedral.  The western facade is supported by a buttress on the south,\r\nand a larger buttress on the north in the shape of a staircase turret,\r\nthe upper portion of which is now lost.  Between these is one of the most\r\nlovely doorways imaginable.  Its jambs are first enriched by an inner\r\npair of pillars, having caps from which spring vigorously, and yet most\r\ndelicately, carved foliage; and then, after a little interval, two more\r\npairs of similar pillars, carrying a beautifully-moulded arch, one member\r\nof which is enriched with the tooth mould.  Above this lovely doorway, in\r\nwhich still hangs the co-eval, delicately-ironed oak door, is an arcade\r\nof similar work, in the centre of which is a pointed oval window of\r\nbeautiful design; but, through the loss of the gable above, this\r\nelevation is sadly marred.  In the north wall, close to the west end, is\r\na semi-circular-headed doorway, similar in general character to the\r\nwestern one, but plainer.  Its arched head, however, is charmingly\r\nmoulded, and has the tooth ornament worked upon its inner chamfer.\r\n\r\n“Within, is a still more beautiful sight than without, for the whole of\r\nthe interior is, in every respect, admirable.\r\n\r\n“A bold, boutel string runs round the walls about five feet from the\r\nground, and from this, at intervals, rise dwarf shafts surmounted by most\r\ndelicately carved caps, the foliation, of which almost looks as if it\r\nmight expand, and yield to the breeze.  These serve as supporters to\r\nvaulting principals, enriched with the tooth ornament, dividing the roof\r\nvaulting into four squares, having large circular foliated bosses in the\r\nmiddle, on the easternmost of which is also carved the holy Lamb and\r\nbannered cross.\r\n\r\n“In each bay of the side walls is a pair of lancet windows, except in the\r\nwesternmost one of the north wall, where the north doorway takes the\r\nplace of one of these, and close to this, in the west wall, is a little\r\ndoorway giving access to the turret staircase.  The triplet at the east\r\nend is simply exquisite.  This consists of a central lancet and a smaller\r\none on either side, between which rise lovely clustered and handed\r\npillars, enriched with flowing foliated caps, supporting, with the aid of\r\ncorresponding responds enriched by the tooth ornament, lovely moulded\r\narches, on which the nail head ornament is used.\r\n\r\n“Towards the east end of the south wall is a piscina, having a triangular\r\nhead and shelf groove.  Towards the west end, on the north side, are\r\nportions of some very valuable woodwork, apparently co-eval with the\r\nchapel itself.  These probably constituted the lower part of a rood\r\nscreen, and consist of slender pillars, supporting lancet-headed\r\narcading.  They are now used as divisions between the seating, and are\r\nmost noteworthy. {246}  There is also a respectable canopied pulpit, of\r\nthe time of James I., but scarcely worthy of the worship it seems to\r\ninvite, from its peculiar position at the east end of the chapel.\r\n\r\n“I must now refer more particularly to a sepulchral effigy in the chapel.\r\nThe lower portion of this is lost, and the remainder is now reared up\r\nagainst the south wall.  This represents a knight in a hauberk of mail\r\ncovered by a surcoat, and drawing his sword slightly out of its sheath,\r\npendent on his left.  At a low level on the right is his shield, and over\r\nhis coife de maille, or mail hood, covering his head, is a cylindrical\r\nhelm, slightly convex at the top, having narrow bands crossing it in\r\nfront, the horizontal one, which is wider than the other, or vertical\r\none, being pierced with ocularia, or vision-slits, but destitute of\r\nbreathing holes below.  The head, thus doubly protected, rests upon a\r\nsmall pillow, from which spring branches of conventional foliage.  These\r\nhelms began to be worn about the opening of the 13th century; to which\r\nbreathing holes were added about 1225.  Thus the armour of this knightly\r\neffigy exactly coincides in date with the architecture of the chapel in\r\nwhich it still remains, and it may well have served to commemorate Robert\r\nde Tattershall and Kirkstead, who died 1212.”\r\n\r\nTo these remarks of the Bishop I here add some valuable observations made\r\nby Mr. Albert Hartshorne, F.S.A., in a Paper read before the\r\nArchæological Institute, {247} and reprinted for private circulation, on\r\n“Kirkstead Chapel, and a remarkable monumental effigy there preserved.”\r\nHe says: “Reared against the south wall at the west end is a monumental\r\neffigy in Forest marble, larger than life, of a man in the military\r\ncostume of the first quarter of the 13th century.  He wears a cylindrical\r\nhelm, a hauberk, apparently hooded, a short surcote, and a broad\r\ncingulum.  The left arm is covered by a ponderous shield, and he draws a\r\nsword in a scabbard.  He wears breeches of mail, but the legs, from the\r\nknees downward, are missing.  The head rests upon a cushion, supported by\r\nconventional foliage.  The occurrence of a cylindrical flat-topped helm\r\nin monumental sculpture is, of itself, sufficiently rare to merit a\r\nnotice.  There are two examples of it at Furness Abbey, two at\r\nChester-le-street, one at Staindrop, and one at Walkern,—seven only in\r\nall, so far as appears to be known.  They occur in the seals of Hen.\r\nIII., Edward I., Alexander II. of Scotland, and Hugh de Vere.  Actual\r\nexamples of such headpieces are certainly of the utmost rarity.  There is\r\na very genuine one in the Tower, and another at Warwick Castle.  Some\r\nsham ones were in the Helmet and Mail Exhibition, held in the rooms of\r\nthe Institute in 1880, and are suitably exposed in the illustrated\r\ncatalogue of this interesting collection.”  “Banded mail,” as it is\r\ncalled, has been one of the archæological difficulties “of the past and\r\npresent generations, and the late Mr. Burges took great trouble in\r\nendeavouring to unravel the mystery of its construction . . . having\r\ncasts made from the only four then known . . . effigies (with it) at\r\nTewkesbury, Tollard Royal, Bedford, and Newton Solney; but . . . he had\r\nto confess, in the end, that he could make nothing satisfactory of it.\r\nHere, at Kirkstead, is the fifth known sculptured example of banded mail\r\nin the kingdom, and . . . it is the earliest example of all . . . it\r\nresembles most the Newton Solney type; but I can throw no light upon the\r\nmail’s construction, though I have long considered the subject, and must\r\nleave the matter as I found it, twenty years ago, a mystery.  If we are\r\nto suppose, as the Bishop Suffragan has suggested, that a local lord\r\nbuilt Kirkstead chapel, then I am disposed to think, with him, that that\r\nlord was Robert de Tattershall and Kirkstead, who died in 1212.  The date\r\nof that chapel may certainly be of about the same period, namely, a\r\nlittle after the time of St. Hugh of Lincoln, and co-eval with the Early\r\nEnglish work of the second period in Lincoln Cathedral.  The effigy may\r\nvery well have been set up to the memory of Robert de Tattershall, a few\r\nyears after his death.”\r\n\r\nSo far the Bishop and Mr. Hartshorne.  We have only to add that, some\r\ntime in the forties, certain alterations were made, such as removing the\r\nthatched roof and covering it with slates, taking away much rotten timber\r\nand replacing it with fresh.  Some so-called “unsightly beams” were also\r\nremoved, but they had probably been introduced at a very early period,\r\nand it was, probably, also mainly due to them that the walls had not\r\nfallen further outward than they had done.  Whereas now, without any such\r\nsupport, and with the massive stone roof pressing upon them, the\r\ndestruction of the building must be only a question of time, and that not\r\na very long one, unless some remedy is applied.  I have a note, from\r\nBaron Hubner’s “Travels through the British Empire,” {249} that “when the\r\ntown of Melbourne, in Australia, in 1836, was yet a small scattered\r\nvillage, with wooden houses, wooden church, &c., a tree was the belfry.”\r\nAt that same period the bell of Kirkstead chapel also hung in a tree,\r\nstill standing at the south-west corner of the churchyard.  Climbing up,\r\na few years ago, to examine the bell, I found the following, cut in the\r\nlead under the bell turret: “Thomas Munsall, Nottingham, August, 1849;\r\nEdward Gadsby, Nottingham, Aug., 1849.  George Whitworth (of Kirkstead),\r\nJoiner.”  The two former slated the roof, and the last was the local\r\ncarpenter.  The history of this church in modern times, as a place of\r\nworship, has bean peculiar.  The estate, having been bestowed upon the\r\nFiennes Clintons by Henry VIII., passed, in the 18th century, by\r\nmarriage, to the Disneys and the benefice, being a Donative and,\r\ntherefore, almost private property, Mr. Daniel Disney, being a\r\nPresbyterian, appointed a minister of that persuasion to officiate; also\r\nendowing it with lands which produced a stipend of £30 a year in 1720.\r\nThis gift was confirmed by his Will.  Presbyterian ministers continued to\r\nhold it till the death of a Mr. Dunkley in 1794.  The manor had then been\r\nsold to the Ellison family, and a suit was instituted to recover the\r\nbenefice to the Church of England; the case was tried at Lincoln Assizes\r\nin 1812, when, by a compromise, the fabric was restored to the Church of\r\nEngland; but the Presbyterian endowment remained in the hands of\r\ntrustees, who subsequently erected a Presbyterian chapel at Kirkstead,\r\nand in more recent times, a manse was built in connection with it, now\r\noccupied by the Rev. R. Holden.  Dr. John Taylor, of Norwich, was one of\r\nthe ministers appointed by Mr. Disney.  He held it some 18 years, from\r\n1715, and here composed his Concordance, in 2 vols.  In 1876 the church\r\nwas visited by the Architectural Society, when, in consequence of its\r\ndangerous condition, it was closed by order of the Bishop, awaiting\r\nrestoration, and it awaits it still.\r\n\r\nOf this interesting structure no one can get any view of the interior\r\nbeyond (strange to say) what can be seen through the keyhole.  May we\r\nhope that the Rontgen Rays may soon be sufficiently developed to enable\r\nus to photograph it through the boards of the ancient door, the hinges of\r\nwhich, we may add, are worthy of notice.  I conclude these remarks upon\r\nit with the words of a former owner, {250a} who was inspired to write of\r\nit thus:—\r\n\r\n    This ancient chanel!  Still the House of God,\r\n    And boasting still the consecrated sod,\r\n    ’Neath which, where ancient oaks, wide-spreading, shade,\r\n    The rude forefathers of the place were laid.\r\n    Fair, too, as ancient, is that holy place,\r\n    Its walls and windows richest traceries grace;\r\n    While clusters of the lightest columns rise,\r\n    And beauties all unlooked for, there surprise.\r\n    ’Twas well, when Ruin smote the neighbouring Pile,\r\n    It spared this humbler Beauty to defile.\r\n    . . . . . . . . .\r\n    O!  ’Tis a gem of purest taste, I ween,\r\n    Though little it be known, and seldom seen.\r\n\r\nThe writer may add that he has himself twice made strenuous efforts,\r\nbacked most earnestly by the late Bishop Wordsworth, and has sent out\r\nmany hundreds of appeals for aid, to prevent this little gem going to\r\nruin; but, owing to apathy and indifference, where they should not have\r\nbeen found, those efforts proved futile.  He can only reiterate the\r\nwarning words of Mr. Albert Hartshorne:—“I know not whether such aid will\r\nbe forthcoming; but of two things I am quite certain: if nothing is done\r\nthe chapel must collapse, and that very soon; and when it does so fall,\r\nit will become such an utter ruin that it would be quite impossible to\r\nput it up again.” {250b}\r\n\r\nOne more historical incident, of more than local interest, may here just\r\nbe mentioned.  It has already been stated that after the Dissolution the\r\nAbbey lands were granted by Henry VIII. to Charles Brandon, Duke of\r\nSuffolk, and that, on the death of his issue the King granted them to the\r\nFiennes Clinton family, in the person of Lord Clinton and Saye,\r\nafterwards Earl of Lincoln.  In this family they remained for several\r\ngenerations, until by marriage they passed to the Disneys.  In the time\r\nof the unhappy King Charles I., families were often divided, one party\r\nremaining true to the Sovereign, and a relative espousing the cause of\r\nthe Commonwealth.  But Henry Clinton, alias Fynes, remained staunch to\r\nhis King, providing horse and arms for the Royalist cause.  This, no\r\ndoubt, brought him not a few enemies; and in consequence he had the great\r\ncompliment paid him of being granted a deed of “Protection” by his\r\ngrateful sovereign.  We cannot give the whole here, but it is entitled\r\n“Protection of Mr. Henry Fynes & his Wyfe.”\r\n\r\n“(Endorsed) by Major Markham of ye Lyfeguards,” and is headed “Charles R\r\n. . . whereas Wee are informed that Henry Fynes of Christed Abbey . . .\r\nand his wyfe are, and have been, in all these rebellious times, persons\r\nvery loyall and well affected to us and our service, wee are graciously\r\npleased to grant them this our speciall Protection, &c., &c. . . . given\r\nat our Court at Oxford ye 7th day of February, 1643.”  A fac-simile copy\r\nof the original is given in “Linc. N. & Q.,” vol. i. (1889), p. 22.\r\n\r\nTo any of his kith and kin who may still be living among us, and they are\r\nnot few, it may be a pleasure and a pride to reflect that their ancestor\r\n“of Christed” shewed himself a true man in times when it needed some\r\ncourage to do so.  None of them could have a better motto to abide by, in\r\nall things, than that of the head of the House, “Loyaltè n’a honte,”\r\nLoyalty is not ashamed.\r\n\r\nOur lengthy peregrinations have now brought us, once more, within a mile\r\nof Woodhall Spa; thither let us proceed, “rest and be thankful.”\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\nAnd now, gentle readers, it would seem we have arrived at a fitting\r\n“period, or full stop,” in our somewhat arduous undertaking; and here we\r\nmight well shake hands and finally part company,—we would fain hope, with\r\na hearty “au revoir.”\r\n\r\nI find myself much in the mood of the Alpine guide who feels that he has\r\nhad more than one long day with his trusty alpenstock, although with a\r\nwilling heart in the work, and, we might say, even proud that he has been\r\nable to show his party through so many attractive scenes.  He stands, as\r\nit were, before them, hat in hand {251} awaiting the “pour boire,” the\r\ndue recompense of his services.  Freely he has given, freely he hopes to\r\nreceive, that he may retire to his quiet châlet on the hill, where he may\r\nrest awhile, till perchance he finds a fresh engagement.  But, at this\r\njuncture, he is accosted by one of the party to this effect: “Mon cher\r\nGuide Walder, you have taken us through more than one enjoyable round in\r\nyour interesting country.  We have looked with pleasure upon many a long\r\nvista in the past, and on many a wide-spreading prospect of varied\r\ncharacter.  You have, indeed, given us a bonne-bouche, to finish with, in\r\nKirkstead, but we would ask, ‘Why have you omitted Somersby, Somersby not\r\nso very far away, and hallowed as the birth-place of the Bard of the\r\nCentury, who is reckoned as one of the High Priests of Poesy, wherever\r\nour English tongue is spoken?’”  We confess the omission.  Our apology\r\nis, that our excursions have already, in the more immediate\r\nneighbourhood, been only too long.  As to Somersby, as its associations\r\nare _sui generis_, so it lies in a direction of its own; not easily to be\r\ncombined with other places of interest; but the fault can be remedied.\r\nQuid multa?  A short supplementary excursion is arranged; and we are to\r\nmuster on the morrow for the last, but not least, of our Looks at\r\nLincolnshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1890, an enthusiastic Tennysonian, giving an account in the\r\n“Globe” newspaper, of an excursion to Somersby, which he approached from\r\nLouth, says that he was somewhat disgusted to find that his Jehu, though\r\nfamiliar with every ragamuffin on the road, and with the gossip and\r\ntraditions of the villages through which they passed, had never heard the\r\nname of Tennyson.  Somersby itself, at the time when Tennyson there\r\nenjoyed ramble and reverie, was so withdrawn from the outer world that it\r\nis said that the battle of Waterloo was not heard of there until a month\r\nafter it had been fought.  But all this has now been changed, and is\r\nchanging.  Not long ago, the proprietor of Somersby (now, alas! an\r\nabsentee), complained to the writer that his carpets were being worn into\r\nholes by the feet of the many pilgrims to this modern poetic “Mecca,” who\r\nseemed to think they had a right freely to intrude everywhere; with the\r\nbarren compensation to himself that his paternal home was becoming\r\nhistorical.  Sympathising fully with the country squire whose privacy has\r\nbeen thus invaded, we are now ourselves about to make the pilgrimage,\r\nwhich may soon be as common as that to the birthplace of the immortal\r\nBard of Avon.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at Horncastle by train, or otherwise, we pass through the\r\ntown, by Market-place, Bull Ring, and over the far bridge, where we turn\r\ndue eastward, by East street.  At the end of a mile or so we arrive at\r\nHigh Toynton, with a modern church of Spilsby sandstone on our right, in\r\ngood condition, but of no special interest; here we turn to the left, and\r\n100 yards further on, again eastward to the right.  We are now on the\r\nWolds, and have before us a steady rise, followed by three steepish\r\ndescents with their corresponding rises, till, as we approach Holbeck\r\nHall, we see before us, to the left, a hill in the shape of an obtuse\r\ntruncated cone.  This is Hoe Hill (Norse ‘hof,’ holy and so possibly a\r\nsacred place for heathen worship; or, the Norse ‘haugr’ or ‘howe,’ a\r\nburial place, possibly the resting-place of some Viking chief, the names\r\nall round having Danish elements).  It has a Dyke, or scarpment, running\r\nround it, like a collar, and was probably a British or Danish encampment;\r\ngeologically it consists of ironstone, quite distinct from the sandstone\r\nformation on the lower ground.  At Holbeck it is worth the while to turn\r\nin at the Lodge gate, and proceed some 250 yards along the drive, when we\r\nfind ourselves among very pretty scenery; the modern Hall confronting us,\r\nbuilt by the late J. Fardell, Esq., who was M.P. for Lincoln for about a\r\nweek.  We pause in a woody dell with a picturesque lake and rocks on each\r\nside of us.  (N.B.—In these rocks the badger still survives).  Retracing\r\nour steps into the main road again, and some 200 yards back towards\r\nHorncastle, by a guide-post the road turns off southward, and, following\r\nthis, we arrive at Ashby Puerorum, or Ashby “of the boys,” so called to\r\ndistinguish it from the other two Ashbys, not far off, the name being\r\nderived from the fact that certain lands in the parish are appropriated\r\nto the maintenance of the choristers of Lincoln Cathedral, the Dean and\r\nChapter being patrons of the benefice.  The road here is somewhat\r\ntortuous, but we find our way to the church, the chancel of which was\r\nrestored by the patrons in 1869, and the rest of the building in 1877.\r\nIt is a small fabric, consisting of nave, north aisle, chancel, small\r\nporch, and western tower.  The main building is Early English.  A lancet\r\nwindow still remains in the south wall, and at the west end of the aisle.\r\nThe other windows of the nave are mostly Perpendicular.  On the south\r\nside of the chancel is a two-light, square-headed, decorated window.  The\r\narcade has two chamfered arches, on low cylindrical piers.  The tower is\r\na low, stunted example of Perpendicular, the green sandstone\r\npicturesquely patched with brick.  The west doorway is well proportioned,\r\nand the three-light Perpendicular window above, and the tower arch, are\r\nplain but good.  There is a plain octagonal font.  On the south wall is a\r\nbrass to Richard Littlebury, of Stainsby, in the parish (obiit 1521); his\r\nwife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edmund Jenny, of Suffolk (died 1523); and\r\ntheir ten children.  The brass, according to Haines, was not cut till\r\n1560, at the same time with another of a knight in armour, now without\r\ninscription, but probably one of the six sons of the above.  In the\r\npavement is a the incised slab of blue marble, representing a priest in\r\nEucharistic vestments, with chalice on the breast.  The head, hands,\r\nchalice, and other portions were of brass, but these have disappeared.\r\nAs has been elsewhere stated, in 1794, a Roman sepulchre was discovered\r\nthree feet below the surface,—a stone chest, containing an urn of strong\r\nglass of greenish hue.  The urn held small pieces of calcined bone, and,\r\namong them, a small lacrimatory of very thin green glass.  Sir Joseph\r\nBanks thought it not improbable that, some day, the site of a Roman villa\r\nmight be found near at hand. {254}\r\n\r\nWe again take to the main road, due eastward, and at the distance of\r\nanother mile or so, we arrive at a steep descent, embowered in lofty\r\ntrees; and, at the foot of this, “The Brook,” immortalized by the\r\nLaureate, winds its musical way beneath the road, under a bridge.  To the\r\nleft we see its course (where the writer has ofttimes “tickled” his\r\ntrout), through a green meadow, as it issues from the wood named “Holy\r\nWell.”  To the right it speeds onward through low-lying lands until it is\r\nlost in the distance.\r\n\r\nProceeding along the narrow lane,—so narrow, indeed, that only at certain\r\npoints can two vehicles pass each other, and shut in by banks of\r\nsandstone,—we reach, on the right, a well in the rock, the latter green\r\nand grey with moss, lichen and fern, the water clear as crystal.  It is,\r\nindeed, a lonely, quiet spot, fit place for musing meditation, in a\r\npoet’s wanderings.  Just a cottage or two to remind one that there is a\r\npopulation, but not obtrusive.  The rectory is the second, and larger, of\r\ntwo houses on the right, though now occupied as a farmhouse.  It is a\r\nquaint, unpretending, old-time residence, uniting manor house and rectory\r\nin one.  At its eastern end is a semi-ecclesiastical addition, with\r\npointed windows having coloured glass of no particular merit.  In the\r\nground-floor apartment in this is a carved mantlepiece, the work of the\r\nLaureate’s father.  Just beyond is a brick castellated building, “The\r\nGrange,” said to have been designed by Vanbrugh.  Its construction is\r\nmassive, and its curious cellars and other details make it something of a\r\n“Romance in brick.”  Certainly it is a fair example of that solid style\r\nof building which gave rise to his (suggested) epitaph,—\r\n\r\n    Lie heavy on him, Earth; for he\r\n    Laid many a heavy weight on thee.\r\n\r\nOne can hardly help feeling that it must have been a reduction from some\r\noriginal, more ambitious, design; and those gloomy cellars may well have\r\nharboured the smuggler, or his illicit hoards, in days when not only\r\nhumbler boards, but the table of parson and squire, boasted unblushingly\r\nof the “Schiedam” which had not paid duty, and was thought the better of\r\nit.  This house is the reputed home of Tennyson’s “Northern Farmer,”\r\nwhose dialect, however, as given by the poet, is generally considered by\r\nexperts, however picturesque, to be considerably overdrawn. {255}  In\r\nSomersby itself, except for its secluded beauty, there would be little to\r\ninterest the visitor were it not for its association with the early years\r\nof the Tennysons.  And one of the present writer’s earliest recollections\r\nis, as a small boy, driving his sisters, in a donkey cart through the\r\nvillage; when they were accosted by two strollers on the road, one of\r\nwhom was Alfred Tennyson, then on a visit to the rectory, and not yet\r\nLaureate.\r\n\r\nThe Church of Somersby has little of interest, beyond a small brass with\r\nkneeling figure of George Littlebury, dated 1612; a stoup in the porch,\r\nand over the porch a sundial, with the legend “Time passeth,” dated 1751.\r\nThe tower, however, has two good mediæval bells.  In repairing the tower\r\nin 1883, a fine window in its western face was removed and replaced by an\r\ninferior one (Saunders “Hist.,” vol. ii., p. 173).  The modern\r\nrestoration, with bright tiling of the floor, gives a brand-new\r\nappearance, rather out of keeping with the almost crumbling low tower,\r\nand rustic surroundings.  The one really interesting feature is the\r\nchurchyard cross.  It is of Perpendicular date, tall, well designed, and\r\nwith octagonal shaft gracefully tapering from the base to a corona, and\r\nhaving above that a cross, which, possibly owing to the very retired\r\nposition of the village, has escaped the iconoclast.  It has, on one\r\nside, the Crucifixion, and on the other the Virgin and Infant Saviour.\r\nIt is almost unique in its very good state of preservation, the Puritans\r\nhaving generally ruthlessly mutilated such erections.  Several models of\r\nit, in bronze, were made some years ago to the order of the late Mr. C.\r\nJ. Caswell, and were speedily sold off as memorials of Tennyson.  It has\r\nalso recently been reproduced in the churchyard of Huttoft, in this\r\ncounty, where the church was restored, in 1895, by Mr. W. Scorer,\r\narchitect, of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nOne of the places visited should be Holy Well wood.  It is a leafy dell,\r\nwhere tower up lofty trees still vigorous, while others are lying rotting\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\n    Nature in her old wild way,\r\n    Life blending closely with decay.\r\n\r\nThe thin stream twines about their roots, or springs over sandstone bars,\r\nin sylvan, solitude.  The spot was described, years ago, by Howitt in his\r\n“Homes and Haunts of English Poets.”  A local authority says that, once\r\nupon a time, a series of steps led down to the well, where an upright\r\npost was fixed, and a cross-bar from it was secured to the rock.  On this\r\ncross-bar was an iron ring and a cable, by which a bather could let\r\nhimself down for a dip in the well; and an old servant of the Tennyson\r\nfamily could remember when numbers of people came to take the water,\r\nwhich was considered to have health-giving properties. {256}\r\n\r\nThe manor of Somersby goes with that of Bag Enderby, and the benefices\r\nare held together, being barely a mile apart.  The church of the latter\r\nis rather more interesting than that of Somersby, and it would be a pity\r\nnot to see it, while we are so far, or near.  It was built by Albin de\r\nEnderby, who died in 1407.  Some of the windows, as the three-light one\r\nat the east end of the chancel, and others are Perpendicular; while\r\nothers are of the Decorated style, but probably of the same date.  There\r\nis some interesting old iron-work on the original oak door in the porch.\r\nThe font is octangular, Perpendicular; on the bowl is carved the figure\r\nof the Virgin, supporting on her knees the dead body of the Saviour; a\r\nshield, on which is cut the spear, and hyssop with sponge, crosswise; the\r\ncross and crown of thorns; a deer couchant with head turned back, and\r\nfeeding on the leaves of a tree; and other more ordinary devices.  The\r\nchancel arch is fine, and there are some remains of a screen.  All the\r\nwindows would seem to have been originally filled with delicately-painted\r\n14th century glass, of which fragments retrain.  In the westernmost\r\nwindow of the south wall of the nave is a shield bearing the arms of\r\nCroyland Abbey.  In the central alley of the nave are two fine Purbeck\r\nmarble slabs, bearing legends on brass plates. {257}  On the north wall\r\nof the chancel is a stone mural monument commemorating Andrew and Dorothy\r\nGedney, with their two sons and two daughters, kneeling before two\r\nprayer-desks, in the costume of their period.  In the churchyard is the\r\nbase of a cross, the upper part having been removed some years ago.  The\r\nfont stands on a sepulchral slab, which has been ruthlessly cut into for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nAs the name Enderby is sometimes, in old documents, written Hinterby, an\r\nidea has been broached that the prefix “Bag,” means “back,” or\r\n“hinder-by.”  But, as we are in the region of sand and sandstone,\r\nabounding in burrows, it would seem more likely that the Bag is the\r\nbadger; after a similar form to Bagshot, in Surrey, _i.e._, Bag or\r\nBadger’s holt; Bagley, near Oxford; Badgeworth, near Cheltenham (from\r\nwhich last neighbourhood the writer has a badger-skin), &c.  An\r\nalternative derivation, of course, is the word Bag, or Bage, _i.e._,\r\n“turf,” for fuel, which might be not unlikely in Lincolnshire; but as\r\n“Bag” enters into place-names all over the kingdom, where the word “Bag,”\r\nfor turf, is not used, this is hardly a likely explanation.\r\n\r\nA short extension of our travels eastwards, through pretty scenery, with\r\nbold rising ground—Somersby Top, Warden Hill, &c.—capped by woods, brings\r\nus to Harrington, where we find an interesting old mansion belonging to\r\nSir H. D. Ingilby, built in the reign of James II. with old-time garden,\r\nhaving parterres and terraces and extensive lawns, but, unfortunately,\r\nnot at present occupied, and much decayed.  There is a very interesting\r\nchurch, almost entirely rebuilt by the late Rector, Rev. R. W. Cracroft,\r\nin 1855, but retaining a series of fine monuments of his own connections,\r\nthe Knightly family of the Coppledykes; the earliest of these, Sir John\r\nde Harrington, temp. Edward I., was a Crusader.  His effigy lies on an\r\naltar tomb, beneath an arch in the south wall, at the east end of the\r\nnave.  He is in complete armour, cross-legged, his hands joined in\r\nprayer.  The next is a slab in the chancel floor, once having brass\r\neffigies, but which, with the inscription, have been removed.  It\r\ncommemorated John Coppledyke and his wife Margaret Tilney, and bore date\r\n1480.  Her effigy is now affixed to the wall of the chancel.  The third\r\nis that of John Coppledyke, who died in 1552.  Then there is the recessed\r\naltar-tomb of his son, also John, who died in 1585.  It is in the Tudor\r\nstyle, altar and canopy all of Purbeck marble.  Opposite is the monument\r\nof his brother Francis and his wife, the former dying in 1590.  Then come\r\ntombs of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period.  This typical series closes\r\nwith the tomb of Thomas, the nephew of Francis, described in the epitaph\r\nas “the last and best of his race.”  The tower and font are the originals\r\npreserved; the latter bears on one of its faces the arms of Tilney\r\nimpaling Coppledyke, shewing that it was the joint gift of John and\r\nMargaret, towards the end of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nWe have taken these latter two churches because they lie within easy\r\nreach from Somersby, the main object of our excursion, and they add to\r\nits interest.  We now turn homewards again, but by a different route.  We\r\nmight, from Somersby, have visited Salmonby, barely a mile away, where\r\nthere is a restored church with some interesting features; and we might\r\nalso have included a visit to Tetford, a large village or small town,\r\nequi-distant from Somersby, with a fairly large church, but in a very bad\r\ncondition and much needing careful restoration.  But these we are\r\nconstrained to omit, as the day’s excursion is to be a short one.  From\r\nHarrington, we turn south-west, and climb a hill of some mile in extent,\r\nto the pleasant village of Hagworthingham, where we find a model church,\r\nbeautifully situated.  It has been largely rebuilt, but retains some\r\nancient features, which show that the structure was originally Early\r\nEnglish.  This style has been retained.  The church has nave, chancel,\r\nsouth aisle, tower and south porch.  The arcade is of four bays, with\r\narches rising from low cylindrical piers, with moulded capitals, earlier\r\nthan the arches which they support.  These low arches give a kind of “dim\r\nreligious light” to the fabric.  The antiquarian, Gervase Holles, says\r\n{259} of this church: “On a gravestone of blue marble, in ye body of ye\r\nChurch is pourtrayed in brasse one in compleat armour, bearing upon ye\r\nmanches of his coate of armes on either side 2 crescents.  Between his\r\nfeet a right hand couped.  The rest is defaced.”  At the present time the\r\nwhole of this is gone.  The font has a plain octagonal basin, supported\r\nby a group of Early English shafts.  The tower is low and square, its\r\ngreenish sandstone being relieved by an intermixture of brick, and has a\r\ngood peal of bells.  The church is well cared for in every way, and its\r\nposition perfect.  Three-quarters of a mile south there is a very\r\ninteresting church at Lusby, but, although some of its peculiar features\r\nwould well repay a visit, it is slightly out of our beat, and we must\r\ndraw the line somewhere.  We have between four and five miles of steep\r\nhills and valleys between us and Horncastle, a route which cannot be\r\nhurried over, and we must push on.  From Greetham Hill, on a clear day,\r\nwe command a view across the Wash, into Norfolk, to our left, while to\r\nour right we again see towering up, 25 miles away, the mass of Lincoln\r\nMinster.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar feature of this supplementary excursion is that it affords a\r\nrevelation to those strangers to Lincolnshire who imagine the county to\r\nbe flat as a billiard table.  We have been truly travelling, as was said\r\nby a Dutch sportsman, 300 years ago (whom I have quoted in a previous\r\nchapter), in “Lincolniensi montium tractu” (“Fuller’s Worthies,” p. 150),\r\n“among the mountains of Lincolnshire.”\r\n\r\nHere we bring our Records and excursions to a close.  Like Vikings of old\r\n(under a figure) we have harried the country round, and (in a sense)\r\nravished its many charms.  We have explored shrines consecrated by olden\r\nmemories, enriched by the associations of centuries; but (unlike the\r\nVikings), we have done this in no irreverent spirit, and with no\r\npredatory purpose.  We have carried off our hoards of treasure, but we\r\nhave left no ill traces behind us of our raid.  No burning monasteries or\r\nhomesteads have marked our track; no orphaned children or widowed wives\r\nfollow us with their execrations.  Enriching ourselves, we have not\r\nimpoverished others, and the country is still open for further\r\ninvestigation, with, doubtless, many a nook yet unexplored, and many a\r\nmushy folio unopened, whence others may extract materials of further\r\ninterest.  On the whole we trust that our readers will endorse the words\r\nof a Lincolnshire man whom we have already quoted more than once, {260}\r\nthat, although ours may be “a county which few have defended, still fewer\r\nhave praised, and too many have depreciated”; yet that it does possess\r\nmany objects and associations of no small interest, and that not the\r\nleast of these are to be found in the Records of Woodhall Spa, and its\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThis is hardly the place to moralise, nor have we space to do so to more\r\nthan a very limited extent; yet two reflections seem to force themselves\r\nupon us as the result of the archæological enquiries which have produced\r\nthe last three chapters of this work.  One of these is the evil\r\nconsequences of a barren formalism in religion.  The monkish perfunctory\r\nservices, with their “vain repetitions” and “long players,” reduced the\r\nindividual well-nigh to the level of a praying machine, which could run\r\noff, as it were, from the reel, so many litanies in a given time, with\r\nlittle effort of intellect, and only a blind exercise of faith; both\r\nfatal to religious vitality.  The dissolution of the monasteries, which\r\nwere, perhaps, more abundant in our own neighbourhood than in any other\r\nsimilarly limited area in the kingdom, is not only a fact in history, but\r\nalso may be an object-lesson in a different age.  At the close of the\r\nenlightened 19th century we witnessed a church—may I not almost say, a\r\nnation?—convulsed over questions of religious ceremonial, which, to minds\r\nendeavouring to take a sober and unbiassed view, seem bordering on the\r\npuerile, compared with the weightier matter of the religion of heart and\r\nlife.  We can hardly help exclaiming, “Oh, that practical Englishmen\r\nwould spend their energies on larger issues rather than thus give a\r\nhandle to their enemies!”  There is such a thing as “having the form of\r\ngodliness without the indwelling power thereof.”  From such let us turn\r\naway, or history may, even yet, repeat itself.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the plunder of the monasteries was primarily,\r\nthough not avowedly, caused by the greed of a master mind, in\r\nWolsey—whose extravagance needed “the sinews of war,” acting upon a\r\ndesire for revenge, deeply seated in the heart of a Sovereign,\r\nself-convicted we may well believe, but stubbornly clinging to his sin;\r\nwhose unjustifiable act, in the divorce of Catherine of Aragon, outraged\r\nthe national sense of right, but especially was condemned by the\r\nreligious orders.  Yet, none the less, though brought about by unworthy\r\nmotives, and the result, as it were, of side issues, the destruction of\r\nthose institutions, with all their virtues and their manifold usefulness,\r\ncoincided with a condition of things, widely prevalent, which rendered\r\nthem only “fit for the burning.”  They had, indeed, served their\r\ngeneration, and more than one, but they had become “carrion” in the\r\nnostrils, and, “where the carcase” was, “the vultures” of retribution,\r\nalmost in the natural order of events, were “gathered together.”\r\n\r\nA second reflection tends in an opposite direction.\r\n\r\nA reactionary sentiment of our day is to make an idol of the great\r\nfigure-head of Puritanism.  We had lately (April 25, 1899) a celebration\r\nof the Tercentenary of Cromwell; in the place of his birth he has been\r\nmade use of (by a strange stroke of irony) as an apostle of education.\r\nProjects are on foot for erecting his statue in positions of honour.  Yet\r\nwe see still in our own neighbourhood, as well as elsewhere, traces of\r\nthe almost universal desecration of our holy places perpetrated by the\r\nfanaticism which he fostered and guided.  Was Henry VIII. an Iconoclast,\r\nin shattering the monasteries?  No less was the crime of Puritanism in\r\ndismantling our churches and stripping them of treasures which were\r\nbeyond price.  The antiquarian Carter says, “Before the hand of\r\ndestruction wrought such fatal devastation, every sacred edifice\r\nthroughout England, whether of confined or extended dimensions, teemed\r\nwith a full and resplendent show of painted glass, all equally excellent,\r\nall equally meritorious” (Remarks on York Minster, Winkle’s “Cathedrals,”\r\nvol. i., p. 54, n. 30).  In confirmation of this I take two instances:\r\nFour miles away we have the fine Church of Coningsby, and we have in\r\nthese pages (pp. 222–226) a detailed description of the splendid series\r\nof coloured windows which formerly adorned that church.  We ask, “Where\r\nare they now?” and echo can only reiterate “Where?”  But for Gervase\r\nHolles, a Lincolnshire man and formerly M.P. for Grimsby, we should not\r\nnow know that they ever existed.  We take another case, one of the\r\nhumblest structures in our neighbourhood, the church of Langton, and we\r\nhave records given by the same authority of windows once existing here\r\nwhose blazonry connected it with the ancient families of Everingham, de\r\nSeyrt, Skipwith, Bec, Ufford, and Willoughby.  Where are they now?  The\r\nwave of Puritanism has swept away every trace of them.  Somersby indeed\r\nretains its churchyard cross, almost an isolated instance.  The Puritan\r\naxe and hammer missed it, no thanks to them.  The beautifully-carved\r\nfragments of destroyed monasteries, preserved perhaps as relics on our\r\ngarden rockeries warn us of the dangers of mere formalism in religion.\r\nThe Puritan spoliation of our holy places warns us against fanaticism and\r\nirreverence.  Turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.  In medio\r\ntutissimus ibis.  We may well “hark back” to the devotion of our\r\nforefathers, but from either extreme, Domine, dirige nos.\r\n\r\nAnd now there only remains the duty, or, rather, the privilege, of saying\r\none parting word more.  A Preface may be called a pre-post-erous\r\nproduction, because, though standing at the head of a book, it is almost\r\ninvariably written after the book is finished, and when the author can\r\ntake a general review of his work.  In the present instance this was\r\nimpossible.  The exigencies of the situation—these Records first\r\nappearing as a weekly series in “The Horncastle News”—required that the\r\nIntroduction, to stand at their head, should be written when the work\r\nitself was yet only an embryo conceived in the writer’s brain.  He may\r\ntruly be said to have begun _ab ovo_.  He knew, indeed, generally, his\r\nown intentions, but he could not possibly, as yet, tell the exact form in\r\nwhich they would be embodied, and, as an unavoidable consequence, in the\r\npresent case, as in not a few others, what should naturally be the head\r\nis here found where the tail should be.  The real Preface closes, instead\r\nof introducing, the writer’s work to his readers.\r\n\r\nA general outline, indeed, of the work had been laid down on paper more\r\nthan a dozen years ago.  During that interval (as also for several years\r\nbefore it) the materials had been accumulating; but still, when the work\r\nactually began to take shape, the writer was standing, as it were, at one\r\nend of a coil, of which he could not see the other; the windlass was\r\nletting down a chain into depths which his eye could not penetrate, nor\r\nhis knowledge yet reach.\r\n\r\nThe outline originally sketched out has really in one only particular\r\nbeen departed from, but, in the process of its evolution, the thread has\r\nconsiderably stretched.  The Clotho of its destiny has spun a longer web\r\nthan had been foreseen by the writer.  On coming to closer quarters with\r\nhis subject, materials multiplied beyond his expectations, and but for\r\nthe pruning knife, the result would have been still larger than it is.\r\n\r\nHow much the author is indebted to the previous industry of others is\r\nshewn by the number of the footnotes, and other references in the text,\r\nwhich together amount to close upon five hundred.  Others have laboured\r\nand he has entered into their labours, and his object, in this, as it\r\nwere, post-prandial utterance, is to own, with gratitude, the varied\r\nviands—epulæ lautissimæ—which he has found spread before him.  He would\r\nsay, with Cicero, opipare epulati sumus; and yet there are many baskets\r\nof fragments left.\r\n\r\nHe would also here express his thanks for the unvaried kindness with\r\nwhich his personal visits, in search of local information, have been\r\nwelcomed; for the helpful response always made to his enquiries; as well\r\nas for the sympathy shewn towards his undertaking.  But for these the\r\nwork could not have attained its present dimensions, nor could much of\r\nits most interesting matter have been obtained; while, further they have\r\nmade the work a task of real pleasure to himself.  He can only say, in\r\nconclusion that if others should find, in the perusal of these pages,\r\neven a tithe of the entertainment which he has himself found in the\r\ncompilation of them, he will be more than satisfied—gratified—by the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GLOSSARY OF LINCOLNSHIRE WORDS & PHASES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Argufy_.

Old Bolingbroke is noted for the ruins of its ancient\r\ncastle, where Henry IV. was born, and long ago gave a title to the earls\r\n“of that ilk.”\r\n\r\n{8a}  Tradition avers that, shortly before this accident occurred, an old\r\nwoman passing near the mine heard a raven—(doubtless a carrion\r\ncrow)—croaking ominously as it sat on the bough of a tree hard by, and\r\nthat it distinctly uttered these words, “carpse, carpse, carpse” (_i.e._,\r\ncorpse), and this she regarded as a certain presage of some fatal\r\noccurence.  Truly the age of witches and warlocks was not yet passed.\r\n\r\n{8b}  Mr. John Sharpe was father of the late Mrs. Michel Fynes and a\r\nrelative of Mr. James Sharpe, of Claremont House, Woodhall Spa.\r\n\r\n{8c}  In Lincolnshire dialect “heard” is commonly pronounced so as to\r\nrhyme with “appeared,” and this is said to be nearest the Saxon\r\npronunciation.\r\n\r\n{8d}  This was at the time of the Peninsular War, with its prolonged\r\nsieges and fearful carnage.\r\n\r\n{9a}  Mr. John Marshall, grocer and draper.\r\n\r\n{9b}  Mr. and Mrs. Michael Fynes—the latter the daughter of Mr. Sharpe,\r\nwho wrote the foregoing verses—have told the writer of several other\r\ninstances of the use of the water at this early period.\r\n\r\n{9c}  This tank was unearthed about the year 1875 by some persons who\r\nwere ratting, and the writer saw it.  It was situated at the back of the\r\nBathhouse, and would be, to the best of his recollection, some 12ft. long\r\nby 8ft. wide, with a depth of 5ft.  It was covered up again, and has (so\r\nfar as he knows) remained so ever since.\r\n\r\n{11a}  There was a Roman brickyard, about two fields from the Bathhouse,\r\nalong the pathway which now runs northwards through Coal Pit Wood and\r\nskirts Bracken Wood.  The pits are still visible where the clay was dug;\r\nalso the broad “ride,” running east and west through Bracken Wood, near\r\nthese pits, is said to have been a Roman road.\r\n\r\n{11b}  In the name Kirkstead Wharf, the etymologist will recognise, in\r\nthe latter portion, the old Norse “wath” or ford.  This was probably, at\r\none time, when the river was wider and shallower, a ford for passengers\r\nand cattle.  There are many places in Yorkshire named Wath, as\r\nWath-on-Dearne, situated on a ford on that river.  This is further\r\nconfirmed by the local pronunciation of the name, which is still\r\nKirkstead Wath, or “the Wath” _par excellence_.  Wath is connected with\r\nour word “wade,” and the Latin vadum, a shallow.\r\n\r\n{11c}  The reader may gather some idea of the slowness of travel from the\r\nfollowing particulars given to the writer by an old gentleman:—“The\r\ncarrier’s cart left Horncastle at 8 a.m., arriving at Kirkstead Wath\r\nbetween 12 and 1 p.m.; or between four and five hours for the seven\r\nmiles.  The packet for Boston passed Kirkstead at 2 p.m. and arrived at\r\nBoston at 5 p.m.  This is now done in about 50 minutes.  It would have\r\nbeen easy for a pedestrian to have walked direct from Horncastle to\r\nBoston in five hours, whereas by this route it took nine hours.”\r\n\r\n{12}  As a further evidence of the difficulty, or rather the perils, of\r\nvehicular traffic in those days, the writer may here mention that he had\r\nonce the unpleasant experience of being among the passengers of the\r\naforesaid carrier’s cart, when the conveyance was overturned in the\r\nditch, the driver being incapable of performing his duty.\r\n\r\n{13}  I may here mention that the anomaly of “donative” benefices was\r\nabolished by Act of Parliament in 1898.\r\n\r\n{14a}  Sir H. Dymoke, Bart., was the last champion who performed the\r\nceremony of throwing down the glove in Westminster Hall at the coronation\r\nof the Sovereign.\r\n\r\n{14b}  The land extending from the present schoolhouse nearly to\r\nMill-lane was at that time crown property, with much more in the\r\nneighbourhood, since sold.\r\n\r\n{14c}  Mr. Lewin himself presented the handsome pulpit of Caen stone, the\r\ncarved poppyheads of the seats, and figures of angels in the roof.  The\r\ncorbels, from which the wooden arches spring, were carved by a barber of\r\nBoston, named White, one of three brothers of humble origin, all of whom\r\ndeveloped talent in different directions: One (Andrew) as an artist in\r\noil-painting of no small merit,—I have seen an oil-painting by\r\nhim—another in rustic garden work, and the brother in question (Robert),\r\ncontinuing his calling as a barber, employed his spare time in carving in\r\nstone.  The corbels in the chancel represent the Queen and Archbishop:\r\nthose in the north wall of the nave bear the arms of the Rev. E. Walter\r\nand his wife; those in the south wall the arms of the Dymokes and the\r\nHotchkin family.  The reading desk was presented by the writer in memory\r\nof his father, the Rev. E. Walter.  As a support to the Credence-table in\r\nthe chancel is a stone with an effigy of a lady abbess of Stixwould\r\nPriory.  This, with the stone for the church, was given by the late Mr.\r\nChristopher Turnor, owner of the Stixwould Estate, from the Priory ruins,\r\nand, as from the rude character of the carving it is evidently of very\r\nearly date, it has been supposed to represent the Lady Lucia, the\r\nfoundress: unfortunately, the masonry being dug from confused heaps,\r\ncovered by the soil and turf of ages, was not, in many cases, laid by the\r\nbuilders in its proper “layer” as it was quarried.  Consequently damp has\r\npenetrated, and frost and thaw have broken it up in many parts of the\r\nchurch walls.  The small coloured window by the pulpit was the gift of\r\nthe writer’s eldest daughter when a child, as a thank-offering on\r\nrecovering from an accident, in which she providentially escaped death,\r\nwhen thrown, dragged, and kicked by her run-away pony.  An engraving of\r\nthe church, with description and other particulars, is to be found in the\r\n“Illustrated London News,” of September 25th, 1817.\r\n\r\n{15}  This syndicate consisted of the Right Honourable Edward Stanhope,\r\nM.P. (since deceased), Right Honourable H. Chaplin, M.P., Sir Richard\r\nWebster, M.P., T. Cheney Garfit, Esq., Kenwick Hall, Louth, and the Rev.\r\nJ. O. Stephens, Rector of Blankney.\r\n\r\n{21a}  The date was February 2nd, 1850.  £200 reward was offered.  The\r\nwriter has seen the printed proclamation of it.  Tasker was buried in the\r\nchurchyard at Scrivelsby, of which benefice his master was rector.\r\n\r\n{21b}  That he was, most probably, the guilty man is further confirmed by\r\nthe following incident, vouched for by my informant, who knew him.  The\r\nkeeper at Tattershall, at that time, was a man named Penny.  He, for his\r\nown reasons, had strong suspicions of the guilt of Kent, but said\r\nnothing, as he could not prove it.  Several years after, Penny retired\r\nfrom his post as keeper, and took a farm, a few miles distant, in\r\nTimberland Fen.  The man Kent, on one occasion called upon him to buy\r\nsome chickens.  In the course of conversation, Penny suddenly turned upon\r\nKent, and said, “What a thing it was that you shot Tasker, as you did!”\r\nKent was so taken by surprise, and confused by the remark, that he at\r\nonce went away without completing his bargain.  It is not, however,\r\nlittle remarkable, that, although no one was convicted of this murder,\r\none of the suspected men, a few years later, committed suicide, another\r\nleft the country, going out to Australia, and a third died of\r\nconsumption.  This looks, presumably, in all three cases, as though\r\nconscience was at work, condemning them, although the law was powerless.\r\nA tombstone was erected to the memory of Richard Tasker, by his master,\r\nin Scrivelsby Churchyard, stating that he “was cruelly murdered” in his\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n{24}  A cast was taken of “Tiger Tom’s” head, after the execution; and a\r\nmould from it now forms an ornament over the door of No. 31, Boston-road,\r\nHorncastle: at present occupied by Mr. Arthur Buttery, but formerly the\r\nresidence of Mr. William Boulton (grandfather of Mr. W. Boulton, landlord\r\nof the Great Northern Hotel), who was present at the execution, and\r\nobtained the cast at that time.  The features are certainly not\r\nprepossessing.  Another cast is in the possession of Mr. Robert\r\nLongstaff, Mareham Road, Horncastle, lately residing at Halstead Hall.\r\n\r\n{27a}  “Over Fen and Wold,” by J. J. Hissey, 1898, p. 290.  Mr. Hissey,\r\nwith his wife, made a driving tour from London to Lincolnshire, and round\r\nthe county, staying for some days at Woodhall.  Anyone who wishes to read\r\na delightfully entertaining account of the chief objects of interest in\r\nthe county, and in the approach to it, cannot do better than get this\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n{27b}  So far from Lincolnshire being all on a dead level, there is a\r\nstiff gradient on the Great Northern line, as it passes through the\r\ncounty, about 2 miles from Essendine, where an elevation is attained\r\nabout 10ft. higher than the cross of St. Paul’s Cathedral; and only some\r\n10ft. lower than the highest point, at Grant’s House, near Berwick.  On\r\nthe old Coach-road from London to Edinburgh, the worst hill in the whole\r\ndistance is that of Gonerby, near Grantham, Lincolnshire.  “Over Fen and\r\nWold,” p. 417.\r\n\r\n{27c}  Quoted by Sir Charles Anderson, in his “Pocket Guide to Lincoln.”\r\n“Harr” is an old Lincolnshire terra for “fog.”  A “sea-harr” is a mist\r\ndrifting inland from the sea.\r\n\r\n{28a}  Song, 25; date, 1612.\r\n\r\n{28b}  “Over Fen and Wold,” pp. 195–6.\r\n\r\n{31}  The above lists are, of course, only selections.  Indeed, on the\r\noccasion to which the last list refers, one of the party produced a\r\nseries of water-colour paintings of wild flowers which are found in the\r\nneighbourhood, beautifully executed by Dr. Burgess, of Spilsby, and\r\nnumbering about 500.\r\n\r\n{32}  In speaking of the silene quinque vulneralis, on a previous page, I\r\nsaid that there was no absolute reason why it should not re-appear in the\r\ngarden of the Victoria Hotel.  The holy thistle is a case in point.\r\nSeveral years ago seeing that it was being steadily exterminated, and\r\nthat the end was inevitably near, the writer transplanted a root to his\r\nown garden.  It flourished there through two seasons, but was eventually,\r\nby mistake, “improved” away, when the garden beds were being dug over.\r\nTo his surprise, some years after, a vigorous plant of it was found\r\ngrowing in his kitchen garden among the potatoes.  Alas!  That also has\r\nnow gone the way of all thistle flesh.\r\n\r\n{33}  “Bage” is an old Lincolnshire word meaning a sod.  In the\r\noverseer’s accounts of the neighbouring parish of Roughton occurs this\r\nentry twice in the year 1707: “2s. 6d. paid for one day’s work of church\r\nmoor bages”; _i.e._, peat cut for fuel.\r\n\r\n{34a}  The birch trees of the neighbourhood, with their silvery bark and\r\nlight and elegant foliage have been very much reduced in numbers, as the\r\nwood is used for “clogs” in the manufacturing districts of Yorkshire and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n{34b}  There is a “Pyewipe” Inn at Lincoln, and Pyewipe Hall, near\r\nKirton-in-Lindsey.\r\n\r\n{34c}  This may seem to the ordinary uninitiated mind to be a stretch of\r\nthe imagination; but if we are to believe Mr. Cornish, the old practised\r\ngunners on our coasts, who make the cries of our wild fowl a life-long\r\nstudy can almost understand them as well as human speech.  See “Animals,\r\ntheir Life and Conversation,” by C. J. Cornish.\r\n\r\n{34d}  They also frequented other moorlands in the north of the county,\r\nin the neighbourhood of Market Rasen and Caistor.\r\n\r\n{35}  The writer has enjoyed the privilege (often a welcome relief from\r\nhard literary, and other labours) of shooting over this ground for more\r\nthan a quarter of a century, having known it for double that period.  His\r\nfather-in-law had it before him; a genuine sportsman of the old type,\r\nbeing one of a trio, who clung to the last, even far into the seventies,\r\nto the old flint gun—the late General Hall, of Sixmile Bottom, near\r\nNewmarket, being the second, and I believe the famous sportsman, Sir\r\nRichard Sutton, the third, two of whose guns became the property of my\r\nfather-in-law.  Only one man was left in the kingdom who made the flints.\r\nA grand weapon was a genuine “flint” of old “Joe” Manton; with plenty of\r\nmetal, a hard hitter, and often equally serviceable when converted into a\r\nbreech-loader.  Its only drawbacks were, that the exposure of the powder\r\nrendered it uncertain in damp weather; and the slowness of ignition; but\r\nthis latter, to a sportsman who had known no other “arm of precision,”\r\nwas little hindrance, and naturally, entered into his calculations\r\nwhenever he pulled trigger.\r\n\r\n{36a}  The writer, from one cause or another, has probably had a unique\r\nexperience of shooting in the neighbourhood of Woodhall and elsewhere.\r\nTo say nothing of shooting in nine other counties, he at one time shot\r\nover the whole of the Kirkstead estate.  During the absence from home of\r\nthe late owner of the Woodhall estate, T. J. Stafford Hotchkin, Esq.,\r\nwhen residing abroad, he, with a friend, shot over all Woodhall.  Within\r\nthe nineties, he, with two others, rented the greater part of the\r\nWoodhall shooting for three years.  He has shot, at one time or another,\r\nin more than 50 parishes in the county.  _Tempora Mutantur_.  Probably\r\nhard times have had an astringent effect on the hospitality of the\r\nshooting fraternity.\r\n\r\n{36b}  I quote from a poem, long ago out of print, written by Richard\r\nEllison, Esq. (of Boultham), entitled “Kirkstead, or the Pleasures of\r\nShooting,” and published in 1837; the proceeds of its sale to be given to\r\nthe funds of a fancy fair held in aid of Lincoln County Hospital.\r\n\r\n{38}  Another anecdote of the said keeper may here be given, which is\r\namusing.  Soon after the above incident he gave notice to quit his place,\r\nin order (as he said) to better himself.  He had often heard me descant\r\non the charms of grouse shooting and deer-stalking, and he came to me to\r\nask me to help him to a situation in Scotland.  I got him the post of\r\nkeeper on a large moor on the shores of Loch Ness.  He was a man with a\r\nbig head, a bulky body, and with rather weak bandy legs (not unlike many\r\na sketch in “Punch”), and though a good English keeper, and able to\r\nstride along through the turnips, in a level country like our own, he was\r\nnot adapted for mountaineering.  One season in the Highlands cooled his\r\nardour, and the very next year he called on me again, being out of place.\r\n“Well,” I asked my friend, “how is it you’re here again”?  “To tell you\r\nthe truth, sir,” he replied, “I could not stand those barelegged Highland\r\ngillies.  [N.B.—He had, himself, no fine calves to show.]  They were\r\nalways a-laughing at me.  And their gaelic was worse than Latin and\r\nGreek.  You’ll never catch me in Scotland again.”  We can picture to\r\nourselves the bandy legs bearing the unwieldly body up a steep brae side;\r\nstumbling over loose stones, struggling through the tall heather, till\r\nbreathless he would pause, while the agile gillies would, chuckling,\r\nleave him behind; pause and ponder with the conclusion not slowly arrived\r\nat, “What a fool I was to leave Woodhall for work like this.”  The\r\nSassenach was indeed out of his element on the Scotch hills.  He took my\r\nadvice; picked up a wife half his own age, and now keeps a country\r\npublic-house, where he can recount his Scotch and other adventures at the\r\nbar.\r\n\r\n{39}  This is also confirmed by a writer in the “Naturalist,” of 1895, p.\r\n67.  He says the bird “is very erratic in its nesting habits.”  He has\r\nfound its egg in a pheasant’s nest, and in two cases the egg laid on the\r\nbare ground.  Only last season I myself found an egg lying without any\r\nnest.\r\n\r\n{40}  This peculiar protective property is not confined to the partridge,\r\nbut seems to apply to game birds generally.  The keeper on the Woodhall\r\nshooting reported to me, on one occasion, that a pheasant had nested\r\nclose to a footpath, where she was certain to be disturbed, and asked\r\npermission to take the eggs to hatch under one of his hens.  Mr. E. M.\r\nCole reports in the “Naturalist” of 1892, p. 182, _Phasianus Colchicus_\r\nnest of seven or eight eggs “found May 6th, on the road margin.”  Mr. J.\r\nWatson, in his book “Sylvan Folk,” says: “A party of ornithologists were\r\ntrying to get a specimen of the ptarmigan in breeding plumage, but failed\r\nup to luncheon time.  Sitting down, the lunch was unstrapped from a pony,\r\nand a strap fell on a ptarmigan, sitting, actually, under the pony.  On\r\nanother occasion a dog sat down upon the hen ptarmigan, which it had not\r\ndiscovered in the middle of the party.”—“Sylvan Folk,” p. 147, Fisher\r\nUnwin, 1889.\r\n\r\n{42}  The writer once witnessed a fight in the air between a kite and a\r\nheron.  Hearing a confused sound of harsh cries overhead, he looked up,\r\nand soon caught sight of two large birds wheeling round and round, each\r\napparently doing its utmost to get above the other.  The two, however,\r\nwere very evenly matched, for, whereas the kite had its strong beak and\r\ntalons, deadly weapons for seizing and rending when at close quarters,\r\nand could make a powerful swoop at his prey—the heron, though an awkward\r\nbird in the air, and ungainly in its movements, had yet its long, sharp,\r\nbill, with which it could receive its enemy as it were “at point of\r\nbayonet,” and even transfix him, should he make a reckless onset.  Again\r\nand again, when the kite succeeded in getting uppermost, he would make a\r\nrapid downward swoop upon the heron; but as he neared the latter, he was\r\nforced swiftly to turn aside, to avoid being pierced through by the long\r\nbill.  This went on for a considerable time, the two birds by turns\r\nsurmounting each other, until they were lost to view in a cloud; and as\r\nto which ultimately gained the day, “witness deponeth not.”\r\n\r\nAs Mary Howitt prettily says;—\r\n\r\n    Up, up into the skies,\r\n       Thy strenuous pinions go;\r\n    While shouts, and cries, and wondering eyes\r\n       Still reach thee from below.\r\n    But higher and higher, like a spirit of fire,\r\n       Still o’er thee hangs thy foe;\r\n    Thy cruel foe, still seeking\r\n       With one down-plunging aim\r\n    To strike thy precious life\r\n       For ever from thy frame;\r\n    But doomed, perhaps, as down he darts,\r\n       Swift as the rustling wind,\r\n    Impaled upon thy upturned beak,\r\n       To leave his own behind.\r\n\r\n                                                              TO THE HERON\r\n\r\n{44a}  The writer, when the sport of hawking was revived some 40 years\r\nago by the late Mr. Barr, witnessed several trials of his hawks, and\r\nhimself tried hawking with the sparrow-hawk on a small scale.  A great\r\nfriend of his took up the sport at one time, and spent a good deal of\r\nmoney on it in securing good birds and well trained; but it almost\r\ninvariably resulted in their getting away.  Failing to kill his quarry,\r\nthe bird would fly wildly about in search of it, thus getting beyond\r\nrecall, and so would eventually go off and resume its wild habits.  After\r\nlosing a hawk for some days, the writer has caught sight of it again,\r\ncalled it, and swung his “lure” in the air to attract it.  The hawk has\r\ncome and fluttered about him, almost within arm’s length, but carefully\r\neluded being taken; and so, after a little playful dalliance, has flown\r\naway again.\r\n\r\n{44b}  Lord Lilford, the great naturalist, states that a pair of owls,\r\nwith their adult progeny, will, in three months, rid the land of no less\r\nthan 10,000 vermin; and Frank Buckland states that he found the remains\r\nof 20 dead rats in one owl’s nest.\r\n\r\n{45}  Among his various pets the writer has tried to keep owls, but not\r\nwith success.  On one occasion he brought home two young birds, taken\r\nfrom a nest on the moor.  They were put into an empty pigeon-cote.  The\r\nnext morning they were found dead, with their claws, in fatal embrace,\r\nburied deep in each other’s eyes.  At another time he reared a couple,\r\nand got them fairly tame.  They were allowed to go out at night to forage\r\nfor themselves.  But on one occasion, for the delectation of some\r\nvisitors, he turned them out in the afternoon before dusk, and\r\n(presumably), taking offence at the affront put upon them, they never\r\nreturned to their quarters.  For a time he heard them in the dusk, and\r\nwhen he called they would even hover about him, uttering a low kind of\r\npurr but keeping carefully out of his reach.\r\n\r\n{46a}  The writer on Jan. 7, 1899, walking along a footpath, saw a pedlar\r\nwho was meeting him, suddenly stop, and poke out a sort of bundle from\r\nthe hedge-bottom with is stick.  On coming up to him he asked what he had\r\ngot.  The reply was “One of the varmints that kill the ducks”; _i.e._,\r\nhedgehog.  On his saying that he did not believe that the creature did\r\nanything of the kind, the pedlar replied, rather indignantly, that he\r\nknew an instance where a hedgehog had killed 20 ducks in a night.  While,\r\nhowever, claiming for the hedgehog, mainly an insect, or vegetable diet,\r\nwe are aware that it is open to the soft impeachment, that it does not\r\nobject, like some of its betters, to an occasional “poached egg,” whether\r\nof duck, chicken, or partridge; and cases are on record of its being\r\ncaught in flagrante delicto, as mentioned by Mr. E. L. Arnold, in his\r\n_Bird Life in England_.\r\n\r\n{46b}  The term “sewer” does not at all imply that this stream was ever\r\nused for sewerage purposes.  It is a survival from old times, once\r\nmeaning a drain or water course.  Commissioners of sewers were appointed\r\nby Henry VIII. under the “Statute of Sewers.”  But the same bucolic mind\r\nwhich can see in the most graceful church tower in the kingdom “Boston\r\n_Stump_,” gives the name of “Sewer” to a stream pellucid enough to be a\r\nfount of Castaly.\r\n\r\n{47}  There are several other birds occasionally about Woodhall, but they\r\ncan hardly be counted among the regular denizens of the district.  The\r\ncurlew has recently been seen during a whole season, doubtless nesting\r\nsomewhere in the neighbourhood, though the nest has not been found.  The\r\nGreen Sand-piper (_Totanus Octaopus_) frequents some of our ponds, but\r\nonly as a bird of passage; the writer has occasionally shot them.  The\r\nRazorbill (_Alca Torda_) is sometimes blown inland to us.  A specimen was\r\ncaught a few years ago, in an exhausted state, by some boys in Woodhall,\r\nand brought to the writer.  A Little Auk (_Alca Arctica_) was caught\r\nunder similar circumstances some years ago.  A specimen of the Scoter, or\r\nSurf-Duck (_Oidemia perspicillata_), was brought to him, exhausted, but\r\nalive.  He took care of it, and fed it.  It recovered, and eventually\r\nregained its freedom, and was seen no more.  Two stuffed specimens of\r\nthat rare bird, the Ruff and Reeve, may be seen at the house of Mr.\r\nCharles Fixter, farmer, within three fields of the Bathhouse, Woodhall.\r\nThey were shot by a Woodhall keeper, at Huttoft, near the sea coast.\r\n\r\n{49}  In connection with this decoy, it may be added that, in order to\r\nprevent the wild ducks being disturbed, no shooting was allowed anywhere\r\nnear it.  There was a large rabbit warren close by, where a peculiar kind\r\nof wild rabbit, black with silver hairs, bred in great numbers.  These,\r\nas they could not be shot, were caught in large deep pits with trap\r\ndoors.  The skins were exported to Prussia, to make busbies for the\r\nsoldiers, while the bodies were sent to Hull market.  For the\r\nentertainment of sporting readers, it may be further mentioned that the\r\nrelative and his son were “crack” shots.  The old gentleman rode a\r\nshooting-pony, and fired from his thigh, instead of from the shoulder.  A\r\nwager was, on one occasion, laid between father and son as to which would\r\nmiss his game first.  They each fired 18 shots before a miss occurred.\r\nWhich of the two was the defaulter, the writer “deponeth not”; but in\r\neither case it was not a bad score.  Sir John Astley, in his\r\nautobiography, mentions that when he was invalided home from the Crimea,\r\nhaving been wounded in the neck, he, for some time, could not get his arm\r\nup, and shot from the thigh, and managed to kill his rabbits.  In the\r\ncase of my relative long practice had made perfect.\r\n\r\n{53a}  Mr. A. E. Pease, M.P., in his volume “Hunting Reminiscences,\r\n1898,” in a chapter on badger hunting, says: “In countries where mange in\r\nfoxes has become a scourge, the preservation of badgers would do much to\r\nremove this plague, for they are wonderful cleansers of earths.”\r\n\r\n{53b}  It is to be hoped that the cruel sport of badger baiting is no\r\nlonger indulged in, although not many years ago (1888), there appeared in\r\nthe columns of the “Exchange and Mart,” the following advertisement:\r\n“Very fine large badger and baiting cage, in good condition; price 20s.”\r\n\r\n{54a}  Badger hunting, a more legitimate sport, is still carried on in a\r\nfew rare instances.  A friend of the writer, for several years, kept\r\nbadger hounds in Gloucestershire, where these animals, are still fairly\r\nnumerous, and the writer still possesses the skin of a badger killed by\r\nhis hounds.  A variety of hounds are used for this sport.  There is the\r\n“smell dog” to track the quarry by his trail left in the previous night;\r\nthe pack of more ordinary dogs to hunt him, and the plucky, smaller dog,\r\nwho “draws” him from his retreat.  It takes a good dog to beard the\r\nbadger.\r\n\r\n{54b}  “Nature Notes, vol. v., 1894, p. 98.”\r\n\r\n{55a}  The late Mr. E. R.

C. Hey, Derwent House, West Ayrton, York, mentions a similar\r\ncase.  (“The Naturalist,” 1895, p. 106).  While a writer in _The Globe_\r\n(April 30, 1896) says that he has seen half-a-dozen bream dead on a river\r\nbank, from not one of which has the otter taken more than this one bite.\r\n\r\n{55d}  See again Nature Notes, quoted above.\r\n\r\n{56}  To shew that the writer is not “speaking without book” in calling\r\nthis neighbourhood a stronghold of Reynard in former years, it is\r\nsufficient to quote two or three of the entries in the accounts of the\r\nParish Overseer of Woodhall, still preserved in the chest at Woodhall\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n                                                £        s.             d.\r\n\r\n“1806, March 30.—Needham’s boy for a            0         1              0\r\nfox\r\n\r\n“1806, April 6.—Paid for foxes                  0        16             3½\r\n\r\n“1814, April 11.—Paid for foxes                 1        12            2½”\r\n\r\nThe slaughter of foxes, even in the 19th century, was thus remunerated at\r\nthe rate of 1s. each; yet, in Woodhall, they would seem to have been so\r\nplentiful, that for such services, with other incidental expenses (such,\r\nprobably, as traps, &c.), as much as £1 12s. 2½d. was paid in one year.\r\nSince those days, there has been a reaction in public sentiment.  _Nous\r\navons changé tout cela_, and instead of putting a price on Reynard’s\r\n_head_, we value his _brush_, and give him general protection.\r\n\r\n{57}  This is confirmed by the late Sir John Astley, who states that, as\r\na boy, he often gave wood-pigeons, rabbits, and rats to a litter of fox\r\ncubs, kept by their keeper within a wire fence, and they almost\r\ninvariably preferred the rat.—“Fifty Years of My Life,” by Sir J. Astley.\r\nVol. i., p. 245.\r\n\r\n{61}  “Hinerarium,” vol. vi., p. 58, 1710.\r\n\r\n{62a}  Part of the Glebe of Kirkby-on-Bain.\r\n\r\n{62b}  I take haphazard two or three entries from my shooting diary,\r\nrecording the produce of a morning’s walk, alone, on the moor, from 10\r\na.m. to 1 p.m.  “Oct. 4, 1874.—9 hares, 8 pheasants, 3 brace of\r\npartridges, 2 couple of rabbits, 3 woodpigeons, 2 waterhens.”  “Oct.\r\n1877.—10 hares, 7 pheasants, 4½ brace of partridges, 2 woodcock, 2 couple\r\nof rabbits.”  “Jan. 29, 1878.—5 pheasants, 4 hares, 2 brace of\r\npartridges, 2½ couple of rabbits, 3 woodcock, 2 woodpigeon, 1 waterhen, 2\r\nsnipe.”\r\n\r\n{63}  The bag that day (Nov. 1877) was 352 hares, 14 pheasants, 8\r\npartridges, 4 rabbits.  I also find the following brief entry: “Nov. 7,\r\n1878—Shot with a party in Kirkstead, killing to my own gun nearly 60\r\nhares.”  And again, “Oct. 19, 1876.  Shot with a friend in Kirkstead, 15\r\nbrace of partridges, 6 brace of pheasants, and 10 hares.”  To show that\r\nthe Kirkstead and Tattershall shootings still maintain their excellence,\r\nI give here the bag on a more recent occasion.  “Oct. 12, 1894.—In\r\nKirkstead a party shot, in the open, 70 brace of partridges, 1 pheasant,\r\nand 110 hares.”  At Tattershall in the same year a party killed 531 hares\r\nin three days.  I have mentioned above, the Tattershall shooting as being\r\n“nearly as good as that of Kirkstead.”  I give here a note or two of\r\nsport on that estate: “Sep. 21, 1876.—Shot with Mr. S. (the lessee of the\r\nshooting) the Witham side of Tattershall.  Bag: 25 hares, 9 brace of\r\npartridges.”  “Sep. 25.—Shot on the same ground, 7 hares, 26 brace of\r\npartridges.”  On the Woodhall ground, hares were always few in number,\r\nthe soil not seeming to suit them; but among partridges I have shared in\r\ngood sport.  I give two entries as samples: “Sep. 16, 1873.—Shot with\r\nCaptain H. (lessee of the shooting) 30½ brace of partridges and 2 hares.”\r\nAnd again, “Nov. 16, 1872.—Shot for the third day, Bracken Wood.  Total\r\nbag, rather more than 400 pheasants in the three days; rabbits, over 150,\r\nand 20 woodcock.”\r\n\r\n{65}  Other instances of albinos are not uncommon, but more among birds\r\nthan quadrupeds.  I find among my notes the following: “Albino shrew\r\nmouse caught at Ackworth, near Pontefract, June, 1895; white robin at\r\nWhitby, Jan., 1896; ditto at Boston, Sept., 1898; white woodcock nested\r\nin Manby Woods, near Louth, with four young of the usual colour, July,\r\n1892; buff woodcock shot at Bestwood, Nottingham, Feb. 1892; white\r\nlandrail shot at Kedleston, near Derby, Sept., 1892; white thrush caught\r\nat Nidderdale, November 1892; cream-coloured skylark shot near Harrogate,\r\nSept., 1891; white jay—two young specimens shot near York, 1893; white\r\nsand martin caught at Killinghall, near Harrogate, July, 1898; at\r\nBrackenborough, near Louth, there were two coveys of partridges, in the\r\nseason of 1896–7, with white specimens among them: and at Stonehouse, in\r\nGloucestershire, a covey of mixed white and brown partridges were\r\nreported in 1897.  A buff hare was shot near Bourne in 1897.”  A white\r\nblack-buck was killed by a friend in Kattiawar, India, in 1897, and I\r\nhave a stuffed specimen of buff blackbird, caught some years ago in the\r\nvicarage garden at Woodhall: the parent birds having buff young two\r\nseasons in succession.\r\n\r\n{67}  In the Southdowns, the hills are called “Downs,” and the valleys\r\n“Deans,” or sometimes by the Devonshire term “Coomb.”\r\n\r\n{69}  Essays on Natural History, Third Series, p. 169.

For\r\nthe benefit of readers who may like to try the fish of our district under\r\nmost favourable conditions, I here give two or three recipes for cooking\r\nthem.  Francatelli, no mean authority, says, “a pike cooked properly can\r\nhold its own against many fish from the sea.”  Boiled with horseradish\r\nsauce and mustard it makes an excellent dish.  Perch, with sorrel sauce\r\nand mayonnaise, is equally good.  Carp, fried with butter, is excellent.\r\nChub, taken in frosty weather, are firm, at other times rather flabby,\r\nbut treated in either of the above ways they are more than palatable.\r\nRoach, cooked on a gridiron, with butter, make a nice breakfast.  Tench,\r\nwith port wine sauce, are a luxury.  Eels, though despised in Scotland,\r\nare very good stewed.\r\n\r\n{76a}  Lincoln Records, quoted in Sir Charles Anderson’s “Pocket Guide of\r\nLincoln,” p. 107.

Any qualms of the\r\nclerical conscience as to the legitimacy of such an avocation—a wholesome\r\ncalling away from graver duties—may be set at rest on episcopal, and even\r\narchi-episcopal, authority.  The late Archbishop Magee was an ardent\r\nfisherman, and would go on flogging on Irish lough or river, even though\r\nhe did not get a single rise.  (See “Life of W. Connor Magee,” by J. C.\r\nMcDonnell.)  And the writer once read, with much enjoyment, an article on\r\nsalmon fishing in the “Quarterly Review,” which was attributed to the\r\nversatile pen of the Bishop of Winchester, better known as “Samuel of\r\nOxford,” who sought occasional relief from his almost superhuman labours\r\non the banks of a Highland river.\r\n\r\n{84a}  The exception to which allusion is here made is the village of\r\nSouth Scarle, about six miles from Lincoln, where a deep boring was made\r\nin 1876, in search of coal.  The depth attained was 2,029 feet, or nearly\r\ntwice that of the Woodhall well; but as only the upper layer of the coal\r\nmeasures was thus reached, and it was calculated that actual coal would\r\nbe some 1,600 feet lower still, or a total depth of 3,600 feet, the\r\nboring was abandoned.  The strata passed through were found to be as\r\nfollows: Alluvial or drift, 10ft.; lower lias clay and limestone, 65ft.\r\nrhœtic beds, 66ft.; the three triassic formations, new red marl (Keuper),\r\nlower keuper sandstone, new red sandstone, 1,359ft.; upper permian marls,\r\nupper magnesian limestone, middle permian marls, lower magnesian\r\nlimestone, permian marl slates, with basement of breccia, 619ft.; and\r\nupper coal measures, 10ft.; total, 2,029ft.\r\n\r\n{84b}  See end of Chapter I. on The History of the Well.\r\n\r\n{85a}  We have the testimony of two of the labourers employed in the\r\nshaft (Cheeseman and Belton) who agree in giving this depth.  They also\r\nstate that the particular stratum was 54ft. thick; that the set of the\r\ncurrent was from south-east to north-west, running from a crack in one\r\nside of the shaft into a corresponding crack in the opposite side, and\r\nthat they both assisted in making a brick and cement lining to the shaft,\r\nleaving a channel behind for the water to run round half the\r\ncircumference, from crack to crack.\r\n\r\n{85b}  We may further add that it is at the junction of the Northampton\r\nsand with the underlying lias, that we find numerous springs in other\r\nparts of the county; as at Navanby, Waddington, Lincoln, Blyborough,\r\nKirton, and several other places.  The Government “Geological Survey\r\nMemoir” for the country around Lincoln (p. 208) agrees in saying that the\r\nWoodhall water comes from the “inferior oolite” which comprises the\r\nNorthampton sands.\r\n\r\n{87a}  “Life of Nansen, 1881–1893,” by W.

The Car Dyke, skirting the Fens, on the west, some\r\nfour miles from Kirkstead, was their work, and a few miles westward is\r\nErmine Street, the great Roman highway, which stretches from Sauton on\r\nthe Humber to London.\r\n\r\n{101a}  The revolution effected in the drainage of the Fens was not\r\naccomplished without considerable and even violent opposition on the part\r\nof many of the inhabitants, who thought that their interests were being\r\nruthlessly disregarded, and in some cases even their means of subsistence\r\ndestroyed.  The state of affairs at this period, and the measures\r\nresorted to, are very graphically described in the historic novel, “A\r\ndaughter of the Fens,” written by Mr. J. T. Bealby.  This book the\r\npresent writer would recommend to visitors to our Lincolnshire\r\nhealth-resort, as likely to give them an interest in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n{101b}  Mr. H. Preston, F.G.S., of Grantham, goes into the matter rather\r\nfully in the “Naturalist” of 1898, pp. 247–255; as also Mr. F. M. Burton,\r\nF.L.S., F.G.S., of Gainsborough had previously done, in the “Naturalist”\r\nof 1895, pp. 273–280.\r\n\r\n{102}  Dr. Oliver (in his “Religious houses on the Witham,” appendix pp.\r\n165–167) says: “The honours of the Witham may be inferred, not only from\r\nthe consecrated spots and temples (once existent) on its banks, but from\r\nits very names.  It was called Grant-avon, or the divine stream; and\r\nCwaith-Ket, _i.e._ the work or river of “Ket” (Ked or Keridwen, the Druid\r\ngoddess Ceres).  Ket survives in Catley, not far from the Witham.  The\r\nriver was worshipped as her embodiment.  Oliver adds: “The sacred places\r\non its banks were more numerous, perhaps than those of any other river in\r\nBritain.”  It will be apparent, to anyone that the name Witham is not a\r\nriver name at all, but that of a village, the village near which the\r\nriver rises.  In the time of Leland, the antiquary (circa 1550) it was\r\nknown as the Lindis.  He says: “There be four ferys upon the water of\r\nLindis betwixt Lincoln and Boston.  Shut (Short) Fery, Tatershaul Fery,\r\nDogdick Fery, Langreth Fery” (quoted by Mr. G. Sills, Archl. His. Wash.,\r\n“Lin. N. and Q.,” Nat. His. section, July, 1897, p. 108).  But Mr. Taylor\r\ntells us (in his “Words and Places,” p. 130) that “throughout the whole\r\nof England there is hardly a single river name which is not Celtic,” and\r\naccordingly the Celtic name of the Witham was Grant-avon (avon meaning\r\n“river”), while the town upon it was Grantham.  It was also known by the\r\nnames “Rhe” and “Aye,” the former Celtic, the latter Saxon or Danish.\r\n“Lin. N. and Q.,” vol. ii., p. 222.\r\n\r\n{103a}  “Introduction to vol. on “The Geology arounde Lincoln.”\r\nGovernment Geolog.

Wheeler, one of our ablest engineers, held the\r\nopinion that there was a time when the Witham, by a somewhat similar\r\nprocess, instead of passing through “the Lincoln Gap,” if it then\r\nexisted, found its way through a low tract of country northward into the\r\nTrent, and so passed out into the Humber.  See “Lincolnshire Notes and\r\nQueries,” vol. i., pp. 53, 54, and 213.  It would almost seem that the\r\npoet Drayton had an idea of something of this kind, when he says of the\r\nWitham—\r\n\r\n    “Leaving her former course in which she first set forth,\r\n    Which seemed to have been directly _to the north_,\r\n    She runs her silver front into the muddy fen\r\n    . . . coming down,\r\n    . . . to lively Botolph’s town.”\r\n\r\n                                                     Polyolbion, song xxv.\r\n\r\nIt may here be added that the antiquary, Stukely, who at one time lived\r\nat Boston was of opinion, that the Witham, at one period, diverged from\r\nits present channel a little below Tattershall, about Dogdyke, to the\r\neast, and through various channels, which are now drains, found its way\r\nto Wainfleet and there debouched into the sea.  And an old map of Richard\r\nof Cirencester, in the 14th century, confirms this.\r\n\r\n{105a}  “Naturalist,” 1895, pp. 230, 231.\r\n\r\n{105b}  This “celt,” as they are called, has been exhibited by the writer\r\nat more than one scientific meeting.  It is still in the possession of\r\nMr. Daft, who would doubtless be glad to show it to any one wishing to\r\nsee it.—N.B.—the term “celt” is not connected with the name Celtic or\r\nKeltic, but is frem a Latin word celtis, or celtes; meaning a chisel, and\r\nused in the Vulgate, Job xix., 24, the classic word is cœlum.\r\n\r\n{106a}  Gov.

J. Todd, F.S.A., 1810, shows the anelace hanging from a\r\nbutton on the breast of his surcoat.  It was usually worn at the girdle,\r\nexcept in the case of ecclesiastics.  M. Paris mentions Petrus de\r\nRivallis as “gestans anelacium ad lumbare, quod clericum non decebat.”\r\nThe present writer possesses what he believes is an anelace, which was\r\nfound among the ruins of a cottage on the Kirkstead Abbey estate some 25\r\nyears ago.  He exhibited it at a meeting in London of the Archæological\r\nInstitute, in November, 1882, where it was described as a “beautiful\r\nknife handle, decorated with nielli of Italian character.”  It is of blue\r\nenamel, beautifully chased with an elegant filigree pattern in silver.\r\nIt has also been pronounced by an authority to be Byzantine work.  As\r\nbeing found near the ruins of Kirkstead Abbey, we might well imagine it\r\nto have hung at the girdle, or from the breast, of some sporting\r\necclesiastic; and to have belonged to the jewelled blade,\r\n\r\n    Wherewith some lordly abbot, in the chase,\r\n    Gave to the deer “embossed” his _coup de grace_.\r\n\r\n{108a}  The conserving properties of the mud ooze is remarkable.  The\r\n“Philosophical Transactions” mention a human body dug up in the Isle of\r\nAxholme, of great antiquity, judging by the structure of the sandals on\r\nits feet, yet the skin was soft and pliable, like doe-skin leather, and\r\nthe hair remained upon it.-—“Lincs. N. & Q.”  Vol. III., p. 197.\r\n\r\n{108b}  This relic of not less that 1700 years ago is further interesting\r\nfrom the fact that the bone, of which it is made, was proved to be that\r\nof a horse, yet the horse must have been smaller than any of the present\r\nday, except the Shetland pony.  The Britons are known to have had horses\r\nof great size, which excited the admiration of Cæsar; which survived in\r\nthe huge war-horse carrying the great weight of the mail-clad Norman\r\nknight in the active exercises of the tournament; and the descendants of\r\nwhich are the Shire horses of to-day.—“The Old English Warhorse,” by Sir\r\nWalter Gilbey.  We may add here, as an interesting fact, that there is\r\nevidence to show that the horses of our neighbourhood were specially\r\nvalued, as far back as the time of the Commonwealth.  Cromwell wrote to\r\nan acquaintance, “I will give you sixty pieces for that black [horse] you\r\nwon [in battle] at Horncastle”; and on the acquaintance not jumping at\r\nthe offer, he wrote again, “I will give you all you ask for the black you\r\nwon the last fight.”—Quoted, “Animals and their Conversations,” p. 85, by\r\nC. J. Cornish.\r\n\r\n{108c}  The bolt of a crossbow was forged square, hence its name\r\n“quarrel,” from “carre,” or “quarre,”—square.—“Lincs.

The height of the urn was 7 inches; its\r\ndiameter at the widest part, 7 inches; diameter of mouth, 4 inches.\r\n\r\n{110b}  At the restoration of the Parish Church in 1864, in making some\r\nalterations in the floor of the chancel, a lead coffin was found below,\r\nsaid to have been that of Lady Jane Dymoke.  It was temporarily removed\r\nduring the operations, but orders were given that it should be\r\nre-interred.  Before, however, these instructions could be carried out,\r\nit mysteriously disappeared, and doubtless found its way to the\r\nmelting-pot.\r\n\r\n{111}  “Proc. Soc. Antiq.” 1849, 1st series, 57.

In connection with “shag,”\r\nwe may add that there is a sea bird frequenting some of our coasts called\r\na “Black-shag.”  Another explanation of Tab-shag, which has been\r\nsuggested is that “Tab” is another word for turf sods, and sods used to\r\nbe cut on the moor for fuel.\r\n\r\n{114b}  “Facts and Remarks relative to the Witham, &c.” by W.

I exhibited it before the Linc.\r\nArchitectural Society, the Society of Antiquaries, &c.; and ultimately\r\npresented it to the British Museum.\r\n\r\n{120c}  The number of monasteries closed by Henry VIII. was 645,\r\ncontaining some 20,000 religious persons.\r\n\r\n{121a}  Anderson’s “Pocket Guide,” pp. 119–121.\r\n\r\n{121b}  Anderson, p. 126.\r\n\r\n{121c}  Letter written to Mr. Page, who was Mayor of Lincoln in that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n{122}  “Brooke’s “History,” pp. 56, 56.\r\n\r\n{125}  Brooke’s “History, pp. 55, 56.\r\n\r\n{126a}  Demesne is an old Norman compound word.  “The Mesne” was “the\r\nLord of the Manor” (conf. Fr. “mener” and “menager”—to command), and\r\n“de-mesne” was the land “of the lord.”  In this case, the “mesne” was\r\noriginally the Baron Eudo, to whom the Conqueror gave the manors of\r\nTattershall and Kirkstead, with certain appendages, of which Woodhall, or\r\na large portion of it, would seem to have been one; for, when his son\r\nBrito endowed the Abbey of Kirkstead, he assigned to it two parts of the\r\nmanor of Woodhall, and the advowson of the benefice.\r\n\r\n{126b}  It was customary, where feasible, to thus connect the moat with\r\nrunning water, to avoid complete stagnation, and so to keep the water\r\nmore healthy.\r\n\r\n{127}  The writer has also an old map, undated, but belonging to a Dutch\r\nHistory of “Lincolnshire” or “Nicolshire,” probably published in the\r\nsixteenth century; also another old map, inscribed “Fodocus Hondius\r\ncælavit Anno Domini 1610,” as well as another by Christophorus Saxton,\r\nundated; in all of which Buckland is given instead of Woodhall.\r\n\r\n{128a}  The Abbot of Bardney had a hunting establishment at Bardney\r\nVaccary; and why not the powerful Abbot of Kirkstead also, who possessed\r\nthe right of “free warren” over many thousands of acres; in the Wildmore\r\nFen alone about 45,000 acres.\r\n\r\n{128b}  That this supposition is correct would seem to be shewn by fact\r\nthat this property—High-hall wood and land adjoining—still belongs to the\r\nEarls of Fortescue, who now own the manor of Tattershall, the estates\r\nhaving gone together since the days of Eudo, in the Conqueror’s time.  In\r\nthe Award Map, one of the fields in Woodhall just outside the High-hall\r\nproperty, is named “Priests’ Moor,” probably as marking the limit of the\r\nChurch (formerly the Abbey) estate, as distinguished from the land of the\r\nBaron.  The Abbots’ land in Woodhall was, at the Dissolution, given to\r\nthe Bishops of Lincoln, and only enfranchised from them in the year 1868.\r\nThe writer has in his possession a copy of the deed, conveying, in the\r\nfirst year of Edward VI., the rectorial rights and appurtenances of\r\nWoodhall to Henry Holbeach, at that time Bishop of Lincoln, and his\r\nsuccessors, “post mon. de Kirksted nuper dissolutum.”\r\n\r\n{129}  The pistol was originally a German invention, so named because its\r\ncalibre corresponded with the diameter of the old coin, “pistole.”  They\r\nwere first used by German cavalry at the battle of Renty (1554), and\r\ncontributed greatly to the defeat of the French.  After that they were\r\nintroduced into the French army, and later into the English.  They were\r\nat first furnished with a matchlock, and fired by a match.  This was\r\nfollowed by a wheel-lock, wound up like a clock, and having a piece of\r\niron pyrite, and later, a piece of flint, for producing ignition.  The\r\nwheel-lock was superseded by the trigger and the hammer, still with\r\nflint.  The percussion cap, invented by the Scotchman, Alexander Forbes,\r\nwas introduced about 1820 (“Notes on Arms and Armour,” by C. Boutell).\r\nThe pistol found at High-hall is inscribed with the two French words\r\n“Shermand Brevete” (patentee).  The earliest pistol preserved in the\r\nUnited Service Museum is supposed to date from Charles I. (Haydn, “Dict.\r\nof Dates”), and it is known that, at that period, the French gunsmiths\r\nwere much in advance of the English.\r\n\r\n{131}  Series ii., 1600–1617, p. 30, No. 34, edited by Rev. A. R.\r\nMaddison, 1891.\r\n\r\n{133}  It may occur to some to wonder for what purpose the Lord Clinton\r\ncould need so many as “1,000 kiddes”; and as a probable answer we may say\r\nthat, in those days, coal was not in universal use, as it is now.\r\nPeat-sods, called in Lincolnshire “bages,” and wood, were the ordinary\r\nfuel.  Hence we find frequent mention of the right of “Turbary,” _i.e._,\r\nof cutting turf on certain lands, as a valuable privilege.  At such an\r\nextensive establishment as Tattershall Castle, then at least three times\r\nits present size, there would be no small number of persons needing\r\nfire-warmth.  The old writer, William of Worcester, (“Itinerarium,” p.\r\n162), tells us that the Lord Treasurer Cromwell’s household consisted\r\nordinarily of 100 persons, and that, when he rode to London, his retinue\r\nwas commonly 120 horsemen (Weir’s “Hist.” vol. i. p. 304, ed. 1828).  The\r\nbeautiful mantelpieces still remaining in the castle, embellished with\r\nhis arms, and the proud motto, “_Ne j’ droit_?”—“Have I not right?” are\r\nfamed throughout the kingdom; and on the spacious hearths beneath them\r\nthe smouldering peat and blazing faggot would yield welcome warmth to\r\nguests and retainers reclining before them, wearied with the varied\r\nlabours of the day: days, indeed, we may well believe, by no means\r\nmonotonous, when it is remembered that, besides the sport of hunting and\r\nhawking, the Lord Clinton’s followers were not uncommonly engaged in\r\npredatory strife (of which I shall presently give instances) with\r\nneighbours hardly less powerful than himself.  By way of adding note to\r\nnote, I may here say that, among the poor, cheaper kinds of fuel were in\r\nuse than the peat and faggot.  Cow-dung was dried in brick-shaped blocks,\r\nwhich were called “dythes”; or sheep-dung into “brocks,” and stacked like\r\npeat for burning.  I have spoken with old people, in the marsh, who\r\nremember both these being in common use.\r\n\r\n{134}  There is a prevalent tendency to pronounce, in a general and\r\nuncritical fashion, many things to be “Roman” which are only ancient and\r\nof indefinite date; an easy way of getting out of a difficulty.  Possibly\r\nwe may trace to this source the origin of the Lincolnshire expression,\r\ndescriptive of anything or anybody out of the ordinary, that it is, or he\r\nis, or she is, “a rum un.”\r\n\r\n{137}  I may, perhaps, here explain that “non-jurors” were those persons\r\nwho considered that James II. was unjustly deposed, and who refused to\r\nswear allegiance to William III. and his successors.  Non-jurors were\r\nsubjected to double taxation, and obliged to register their estates\r\n(1723); and from the first were excluded from any public office.  I may\r\nalso here state that the Sir Richard Morrison who is named in this\r\nepitaph was a man of great learning, and employed by Henry VIII. and\r\nEdward VI. in several embassies to the greatest princes in Europe\r\n(Camden’s “Britannia,” p. 302).  He was also appointed “President of\r\nMounster in Ireland.”  He had a brother, Fynes Morrison, who was fellow\r\nof Peterhouse, Cambridge, who obtained from his college permission to\r\ntravel, and spent eight years in foreign parts.  On his return he went to\r\nIreland and became secretary to Sir Charles Blount, the Lord Lieutenant.\r\nThere he wrote an account, in Latin, of his “Travels through the twelve\r\ndominions of Germany, Bohemia, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark,\r\nPoland, England, Scotland and Ireland.”  These he afterwards translated\r\ninto English, but they were not published till three years after his\r\ndeath, which occurred in 1614.  His works are a treasury of old-time\r\ninformation, and he is named in the second volume of “Magna Britannia”\r\namong the learned men whom our county has produced.\r\n\r\n{138}  It is a coincidence which seems to merit a note, that on the very\r\nday on which these lines were penned it was the writer’s duty to unite in\r\nthe bonds of wedlock a young woman whose mother’s maiden-name was Fynes,\r\nto her cousin, Charles Fynes: their common grandfather, Charles Pelham\r\nFynes, a fine sample of the old English yeoman, having been, as well as\r\ntwo of his sons, the tenant of land held under the writer, and under his\r\nfather before him, during many years.\r\n\r\n{139}  This font which is old Norman, plain, but massive, was, some years\r\nago, taken away from its position at Poolham, and, by way of rescuing it\r\nfrom destruction, was placed as an ornamental relic in the garden of\r\nWhispington Vicarage, by the late Rev. C. P. Terrot who was, in his day,\r\none of our greatest antiquaries.  When the writer restored Woodhall\r\nChurch, in 1893, the font in that church being of no architectural value,\r\nhe obtained the gift of this ancient font and restored it to its original\r\nreligious purpose, where it now stands, supported by four handsome\r\ncolumns of serpentine, the gift of the Rev. J. A. Penny, the present\r\nVicar of Whispington.  The gravestone here referred to was taken away\r\nsome years ago, and now forms the sill of a cottage doorway in Stixwould.\r\n\r\n{142a}  He sold Tetford to George Anton, Esq., through whose daughter\r\nElizabeth, married to Sir Edward Hussey, that property passed to the\r\nHussey family, the head of which was Lord Hussey of Sleaford, who, for\r\nhis treachery at the time of the Lincolnshire Rebellion, was attainted\r\nand beheaded by Henry VIII., as were also the Abbots of Kirkstead and\r\nBarlings, and many more.  He sold Somersby to George Littlebury (to whom\r\nthere is a memorial tablet in the church), a younger son of Thomas\r\nLittlebury of Stainsby.  These Littleburys, again, Sir John of Stainsby,\r\nwith Humphrey of Hagworthingham, and Robert his brother, were all mixed\r\nup with the Lincolnshire Rising; so, also, was their relative, Andrew\r\nGedney, “lord of Oxcombe and of Bag Enderby” (of whom, and his wife\r\nDorothy, there is a mural monument in the church), who married a daughter\r\nof Sir William Skipwith of South Ormsby; so, also, were the Dightons,\r\nRobert of Stourton and Thomas of Waddingworth, all in this neighbourhood;\r\nso, also, was William Dalyson, of a very old family (D’Alencon) of\r\nLaughton; with scores more: John Savile of Poolham, Vincent Welby of\r\nHalstead Hall, Stixwould; several Dymokes, Heneages, Massingberds,\r\nTyrwhitts, &c., &c.  But these are mentioned here because the\r\nLittleburys, the Gedneys, the Dightons and the Dalysons, were connected,\r\nin one way or another, with the family, on one side, of the present\r\nwriter.  He may further add here, in connection with the Saviles, that\r\nwhen the first Napoleon was expected to invade England, a Company of\r\nVolunteer Grenadiers was raised in the loyal town of Pontefract, of which\r\na Savile, Lord Mexborough, was Colonel Commandant, and the writer’s\r\ngrandfather, George Pyemont, of Tanshelf House, of Methley and Rothwell,\r\nwas Major.  The Major’s sword hangs on the dining-room wall at Langton\r\nRectory.\r\n\r\n{142b}  Thoroton’s “Hist. of Notts.,” vol. iii., p. 360.\r\n\r\n{142c}  “Collin’s Peer.,” vol. i., p. 207.

The first syllable of\r\nSto-bourne would be “stow” or “stoc” a “stake” or post, marking the\r\nboundary; oftener used as a suffix than a prefix, as in Hawkstow,\r\nChepstow, Woodstock, &c.\r\n\r\n{143c}  Thomas Metham of Metham.  The chief seat of the Methams was\r\nBullington Priory.  A George Metham was executor, with Andrew Gedney, to\r\nSir William Skipwith’s will proved 31st March, 1587.  Metham’s letter,\r\nquoted above, is given in the “Lansdown MSS.” 27, Art. 32.\r\n\r\n{144}  “Lansdown MSS.” 27, Art. 41.\r\n\r\n{145}  These details are given in a Paper on “The feuds of Old\r\nLincolnshire Families,” by Lord Monson (“Proceedings of Archæol.\r\nInstitute, Lincoln,” 1848).\r\n\r\n{146}  There is a common tendency to give a far-fetched origin to ancient\r\nstructures and things, to make them more remarkable; but the skill and\r\neconomy of the old builders often lay in utilising and making the most of\r\nmaterial at hand.  The bricks of Tattershall Castle have been said to be\r\nDutch, and brought up the Witham from the “Low Countries” in exchange for\r\nother commodities; but a geologist assures me that both the bricks and\r\nthe mortar at Tattershall, when examined, shew a native origin; and, so,\r\ndoubtless, the bricks of Halstead are “born of the soil” of the locality.\r\n\r\n{149a}  To show that I am not here speaking “without book,” I may cite\r\nthe following:—Some years ago a bundle of papers were found among the\r\nArchives at Lincoln, stitched together, and much damaged by time.  They\r\nproved to be “Letters of indulgence,” issued by Bishop Dalderby of\r\nLincoln, in which he instructed the Deans to enjoin the clergy throughout\r\ntheir deaneries to make it known, on Sundays and other festivals, that\r\nmoney was needed to complete the central tower of the Cathedral, and that\r\nindulgences and other privileges would be granted (indulgencias\r\nmultiplices, et alia Suffragia) to any who should contribute to this\r\nobject (qui ad constructionem campanilis contulerint subsidia.)  This\r\nmandate was dated Stowe-park vii.  1d.  Marcii A.D. MCCCVI.  Among these\r\npapers was found a letter of indulgence from John, Bishop of Carlisle,\r\ndated Horncastle, May 12, 1305 (that Prelate then having a palace at\r\nHorncastle, on what are now the premises of Mr. Lunn, grocer), and a\r\nsimilar document from Walter, Archbishop of Canterbury, dated Lincoln,\r\nOct. 11, 1314; shewing that the practice was a universal one.  The\r\nIndulgences were, in each case, for forty days.  We may look with\r\nadmiration at our Cathedral, “fabrica tam nobilis, et honorifica toti\r\nregno,” as the Bishop calls it; but surely it takes not a little gilt\r\nfrom the gingerbread, when we reflect that this grand edifice was not\r\nentirely the product of the piety of our forefathers, as we have too\r\nfondly supposed, but due largely to the episcopal sanction of what with\r\nall charity, can hardly be called a pious fraud; and that it was really\r\npaid for by “the wages of sin.”  The individuals were granted their forty\r\ndays’ “fling” of iniquity, with the episcopal pledge of exemption from\r\nits penalty, provided they responded to the episcopal call—a system of\r\n“Do ut des,” based on a “superstitio damnabilis,”—Bishop Dalderby’s\r\nMemorandums, 101 b.  Quoted “Archit. Soc. Reports,” vol. iv., pt. ***.,\r\npp, 42, 43.  The author of a book recently (1904) published on “French\r\nCathedrals,” says that many of them were “built in expiation of wrong\r\ndeeds.”\r\n\r\n{149b}  “Ayen-bite of Inwyt,” by Dan Michel (Early English Text Society),\r\nedited by R.

On the\r\nfour arms of the cross were the capital letters LX—DI—ST—VRA, and in the\r\ncentre the letter E.  Taking this letter as common to all four arms, we\r\nget Lex., Dei, Est, Vera; the law of God is true.

It reads thus,\r\nin something better than monkish Latin:—\r\n\r\n    Impregnata parens patitur per somnia multum,\r\n       Quod nihil in ventre sit, nisi grande caput;\r\n    Et tam grande caput, et tanto robore forte,\r\n       Quod puer ex utero fultus abit baculo.\r\n\r\nWhich may be done thus into English:—\r\n\r\n    A mother, great with coming child,\r\n       Much suffers in her dreams,\r\n    That naught beyond a monster head\r\n       Her inward burden seems.\r\n    A head so huge, yet with such might\r\n       Endowed, that at his birth,\r\n    Supported on a wooden staff\r\n       The infant issues forth.\r\n\r\n{173}  The account of this incident is also given in “Gilda\r\nAurifabrorum,” by Chaffers, 66.  King Charles seems to have made himself\r\nmerry over his cups, with others beside the Lord Mayor.  It is recorded\r\nthat dining with Chief Justice Sir George Jeffreys, the sovereign found\r\nhis lordship’s wine so good that he “drank to him seven times.”—Verny,\r\n“Memoirs,” vol. iv., p. 234\r\n\r\n{175}  Early in this chapter.\r\n\r\n{176}  “Religious Houses on the Witham,” Appendix, p. 167, note 46.\r\n\r\n{178}  Bull-baiting was in vogue at Stamford in this county as early as\r\nthe reign of King John, 1209, and continued till 1839.\r\n\r\nA bill against the sport was introduced into the House of Commons, May\r\n24th, 1802, but was rejected, mainly through the influence of Mr.\r\nWyndham, who used some curious arguments in favour of the sport.  It has\r\nsince been made illegal, through the instrumentality of the Society for\r\nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals, established 1824.  At one time many\r\ntowns, and even villages, practised the sport.  Strutt, “Sports” (p.\r\n277), says many of the rings “remain at the present time” (1780.)\r\n\r\n{179}  Liberty to hold an annual fair, two days before the Eve of St.\r\nBarnabas, and to continue eight days, was granted by Henry III. by\r\ncharter, to Ralph de Rhodes, Lord of the Manor.  This is the present June\r\nFair.  A. second charter, granted by the same king, empowered the Lord of\r\nthe Manor to hold an annual fair, to commence on the Eve of the Feast of\r\nSt. Lawrence, and to continue seven days.  This is the great August Fair,\r\nonce perhaps the largest in the world, though now greatly reduced.  Our\r\nthird, or October, Fair was removed to Horncastle from Market Stainton,\r\nwhere it was a Statute Fair, in 1768.\r\n\r\n{180}  The institution of “Bough-houses” at fairs was not confined to\r\nHorncastle.  By Act of Parliament (35 George III., c. 113, s. 17) an\r\nexception was made to the general rule of a license being required for\r\nthe sale of beer, that at fair-time any one hanging a bough at their\r\ndoor, and thus constituting the house a “booth,” might sell beer without\r\na license.  It prevailed at Pershore, with the sanction of the\r\nmagistrates, as late as 1863; also at Bridgewater, Church Staunton, and\r\nNewton Poppleford (“Notes and Queries,” 3rd series, vol. iv., pp. 141 and\r\n258).  Hence we find at Carmarthen, the principal hotel named “The Ivy\r\nBush”; and at Carlisle, in English Street, there is a coaching inn called\r\n“The Bush.”  (“On the track of the Mail Coach,” by J. E. Baines, p. 226).\r\nThere is also a “Bush Hotel” at Farnham.  In out-of-the-way parts of\r\nGermany, as in the Upper Eisel District, at the village feast called\r\n“Kirmess” a bough is hung out at a house door to shew that refreshment\r\nmay be obtained there.  (“Field, Forest, and Fell,” by J. A. Owen, p.\r\n74).  Of the existence of similar houses at an early period in England,\r\nwe have evidence in Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales.”  There were ale-houses\r\non the country road-sides, marked by a pole projecting over the door; and\r\nas the pilgrims rode along, the Pardoner would not begin his tale till he\r\nhad stopped to refresh himself,\r\n\r\n    “But first, quod he, her, at thys ale-stake,\r\n    I will both drynke, and biten at a cake.”\r\n\r\nJusseraud, in his “Wayfaring life of 14th century,” gives a sketch of\r\nsuch a Bow-house from a XIV. century illuminated MS.\r\n\r\n{181}  This peculiar and ready mode of dissolving the bond of wedlock was\r\nnot uncommon in former times; but I have a note of a similar transaction\r\noccurring in or near Scarborough in a quite recent year; and in 1898\r\n(Nov. 18) a case came before Mr. Justice Kekewich, in the Chancery Court,\r\nwhen it was found that one of the parties concerned, before leaving this\r\ncountry for Australia, had sold his wife for £250.\r\n\r\n{183}  Abbey and Overton, “Church of England in the 18th Century,” quoted\r\n“Church Folklore,” by J.

The Verneys’ relative, Dr. Denton, present with the\r\nforces, writes, “Our men are very rawe, our armes, of all sorts, naught,\r\nour vittle scarce, and provision for horses worse” (p. 315).  Sir Jacob\r\nAstley writes, his recruits “have neither colours nor halberts”; and he\r\nhas to “receive all the arch knaves of the kingdom, who beat their\r\nofficers and break open prisons.”  Edmund Verney writes, “We have 6\r\nweeks’ pay due, and unless there be some speedy payment, you may expect\r\nto hear that our souldyers are in a mutiny; they are notable sheep\r\nstealers already.”  Many had only rude pykes and lances; few who had a\r\nmusket had a sword as well.  Pistols and matchlocks were scarce.  Old\r\narmour, which had hung in churches and manor houses, was used over again\r\n(pp. 109–116).\r\n\r\n{192a}  Walker’s “Sufferings of the Clergy,” pt. ii, pp. 252, 253.\r\n\r\n{192b}  Chancery Inquis., p. mort, 8 Ric.

Rot., 13 Hen III., given in “Lincs. N. & Q.,” vol. i, p. 49.\r\nFrom a very early period churches and churchyards were regarded as so\r\nsacred that a criminal, having reached one of these, like the Biblical\r\ncities of refuge, could not be disturbed.  On the north door of Durham\r\nCathedral there is a ponderous bronze knocker-ring, to which the\r\ncriminal, clinging, was safe.  There is another at Hexham, and at St.\r\nGregory’s, Norwich.  At Westminster, Worcester, Croyland, Tintern, and\r\nmany other places, there was the same privilege.  In Beverley Minster\r\nthere is a remarkable stone called the “Frith-stool,” because it “freeth”\r\nthe criminal from pursuit.  It is recorded that in 1325 ten men escaped\r\nfrom Newgate, four of them to the Church of St. Sepulchre, and one to St.\r\nBride’s.  Nicholas de Porter joined in dragging a man from Sanctuary, who\r\nwas afterwards executed.  But this act was itself so great an offence,\r\nthat he only obtained pardon through the Papal Nuncio, on doing penance\r\nin his shirt and bare head and feet in the church porch, on Monday,\r\nTuesday, and Wednesday in Whitsun week.  A result, however, of the abuse\r\nof Sanctuary was, that churches being so numerous over the country,\r\ncriminals could always obtain a refuge, and the roads became infested\r\nwith highwaymen.  Henry VIII. passed Acts curtailing the privilege, and\r\nit was finally abolished by James I., 1624—“New Quarterly Mag.,” Jan.,\r\n1880.  _Et alibi_.\r\n\r\n{194a}  Collectanea, vol. ii., p. 300.\r\n\r\n{194b}  Although these events happened more than 250 years ago, it does\r\nnot require many links to connect that day with the present.  The writer\r\nwas informed, at the time he was putting these records together, that a\r\nman named John Barber died in Horncastle, aged 95, in the year 1855 or\r\n1856, whose grandfather remembered Oliver Cromwell sleeping in the\r\nabove-named house, then a mud and stud structure, on the night before\r\nWinceby fight.  In the Register of West Barkwith is recorded the burial\r\nof Nicholas Vickers in 1719, who guided Cromwell over Market Rasen Moor\r\nafter the battle.  Cromwell may well, therefore, have returned to the\r\nsame house at Horncastle before proceeding northward by Market Rasen.\r\n\r\n{196a}  “Monasticon,” p. 45.\r\n\r\n{196b}  “History of the House of Marmion,” p. 18.\r\n\r\n{197a}  Berewick is a hamlet or minor manor attached to a larger.  The\r\nword strictly means cornland (bere, or barley).  This Dispenser, as his\r\nname (Latin Dispensator) implies, was steward to the Conqueror.  His\r\ndescendants were the Despensers, Earls of Gloucester.  He was brother to\r\nthe Earl Montgomery.  Being a powerful man, he forcibly seized the\r\nlordship of Elmley from the monks of Worcester.

He was discovered an hour or more afterwards by a\r\nrailway servant, who walked down the line.  He was conveyed to his\r\nresidence at Horncastle, but never recovered the sense of feeling below\r\nhis neck.  The present writer frequently read to him in his illness.\r\nAfter some weeks he regained a slight power of movement in his feet,\r\nwhich gave hopes of recovery; but soon after this, his attendant, on\r\nvisiting him, found him dead in his bed.\r\n\r\n{205a}  Blomfield, “Hist. of Norfolk,” vol. iii., p. 187.\r\n\r\n{205b}  Dugdale’s “Baronage,” vol. i., p. 439.\r\n\r\n{208a}  This list was published by T.

Henry VIth.  The\r\numbrosa quercus, or shadowy oak, represented a play upon the two\r\nsyllables dim-oak.  The term ‘Rebus’ is from the Latin rebus, ‘by\r\nthings,’ because it is a name-device, the representation of a name by\r\nobjects.  On this principle the crest of Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, was\r\na boar.  The boar is also found in the arms of Swinburne, Swinton,\r\nSwinney, &c.  An old poem says,\r\n\r\n    Whilst Bacon was but bacon, had he fearde,\r\n    He long ere this had proved but _larde_;\r\n    But he, instead of larde, must be a lord,\r\n    And so grew leane, and was not fit for boarde.\r\n\r\nAnd, again, we find,\r\n\r\n    There needed not to blazon forth the Swinton,\r\n    His ancient burgonet the boar; &c.\r\n\r\n                             “Cambridge Portfolio,” vol. i., pp. 233, 234.\r\n\r\nThis may be a convenient place to discuss the origin of the name Dymock.\r\nWalford (“Tales of Great Families”) says the name is Welsh, being a\r\ncontraction of Daimadoc, which means David Madoc.  He was a descendant of\r\nOwen Tudor, Lord of Hereford and Whittington.  This chief had three sons;\r\nthe second married a daughter of the Prince of North Wales, half a\r\ncentury before the Conquest, and was ancestor of David ap Madoc;\r\nDai-Madoc, in course of time, shrinking into Daimoc, or Dymoke.  Burke\r\nsays that the John Dymoke who married Margaret de Ludlow, granddaughter\r\nof Philip de Marmion, was a knight of ancient Gloucestershire ancestry,\r\nand there is a village of Dymock, near Gloucester.  A Welsh origin is\r\nlikely, as there were Dymokes of Pentre in Wales; the Lady Margaret de\r\nLudlow, who married Sir John Dymoke of Scrivelsby, took her title from\r\nLudlow in the adjoining county of Salop.  And another Welsh origin of the\r\nname has been suggested.  “Ty,” pronounced “Dy” in Welsh, means “house”;\r\n“moch” means “swine”; and so Dymoke would mean Swinehouse, after the\r\nfashion of Swynburne, Swinhop, Swineshead; all old names.  The motto of\r\nthe Dymokes, adopted at a later date, Pro Rege Dimico, “I fight for the\r\nKing,” is again a case, though most appropriate, of a “canting” motto.\r\n\r\n{211}  I am indebted, for these details, to that very interesting work,\r\nWalford’s “Tales of Great Families.”\r\n\r\n{212a}  “Words of Wellington,” by Sir William Fraser, Bart., pp. 41–44.\r\nThe “Gentleman’s Magazine” for 1821 contains a picture of Sir H. Dymoke,\r\nriding on his white charger into Westminster Hall, supported on either\r\nside by the Duke of Wellington and Marquis of Anglesey, on horseback; and\r\ntwo Heralds, with tabards and plumes, on foot.\r\n\r\n{212b}  (_a_) sword, (_b_) girdle, (_c_) scabbard, (_d_) partisans,\r\n_i.e._ halberts, (_e_) gilt, (_f_) pole-axe, an ancient weapon, having a\r\nhandle, with an iron head, on the one side forming an axe, and the other\r\nside a hammer; this, in the hands of a strong man was a fatal instrument\r\nof destruction; (_g_) the chasing staff was a gilt “wand of office”\r\ncarried before the Champion, to clear the way, (_h_) a pair of gilt\r\nspurs.\r\n\r\n{215}  Had we continued on the road skirting the Park and passing within\r\n150 yards of Scrivelsby church, we should have presently reached the\r\nvillage of Moorby, with a modern brick church, but having a remarkable\r\nold font, and part of an uncommon “minstril column;” thence, turning\r\nwestward, we might have passed through Wood Enderby, with modern church\r\nof sandstone; and so have reached Haltham, our next stage; but this route\r\nmust be considered as rather beyond a walk or drive from Woodhall Spa,\r\nalthough it would repay the energetic visitor to take it.\r\n\r\n{216}  This description is mainly taken from an account given by the Rev.\r\nJ. A. Penny in “Linc. N. & Q.” vol. iv., pp. 161–164.\r\n\r\n{217}  “Lincs. N. & Q.,” vol. iii., pp. 245, 246.  It may be remarked\r\nthat this kind of tenure is not so uncommon as has been supposed.  In an\r\nold undated Deed, but of the time of Richard I., William, Clerk of\r\nHameringham, a parish within four miles of Haltham, makes a grant of land\r\nto the monks of Revesby on condition of their providing him and his heirs\r\nannually at Michaelmas a pair of spurs.  Blount (“Tenures of Land and\r\nCustoms of Manors,” pp. 115, 237) mentions similar tenures in Notts. and\r\nKent (“Lincs. N. A Q.,” vol. i., p. 256).  There is a peculiarity about\r\nthese two “spur” tenures in our neighbourhood worthy of note.  An old\r\nchronicler says that, when the freebooter’s larder got low, his wife had\r\nonly to put a pair of spurs in his platter, as a hint that he must issue\r\nforth to replenish it.  We can, without any great stretch of imagination,\r\npicture to ourselves the knight, Ralph de Rhodes, making an inroad on a\r\nneighbour’s soil, and therefore the annual gift of spurs would be\r\nacceptable, for himself or his men.  But to the country parson we can\r\nhardly deem such a gift appropriate.  He could scarcely be a “clerk of\r\nSt. Nicholas,” as well as clerk of his benefice; and even were he always\r\nto make the round of his parish on horseback, his spurs would hardly need\r\nyearly renewal.\r\n\r\n{218}  The Saxon is Cyning; the Danish Koning, and Konge; English King.\r\nIn not a few cases history records the occasion when the king’s presence\r\ngave the name; as at Kingston-on-Thames, where there is a stone, still\r\ncarefully preserved, on which the Saxon kings sat to be crowned.\r\nKing’s-gate, in the Isle of Thanet, is the spot where Charles II. landed\r\nat the Restoration.  The manor of Hull (Kingston-on-Hull) was purchased\r\nby Edward I., and King’s Lynn, Lyme Regis, Conington, Cunningham,\r\nConey-garth, Coningsby, all tell the same tale.  They perpetuate their\r\nrespect for Royalty in the very name they took.—Taylor, “Words and\r\nPlaces,” pp. 201, 203.\r\n\r\n{219a}  Lord Coningsby had two sons, Humphrey and Ferdinand, whose\r\nbaptisms are entered in the register of Bodisham, or Bodenham,\r\nHerefordshire, with dates 16 Feb., 1681–2, and 6 May, 1683.—“Lincs. N. &\r\nQ.,” vol. iii, p. 24.\r\n\r\n{219b}  “Sac” means the power to hear causes, levy fines, &c.; “soc” is\r\nthe district over which he had this power.  “Mansion,” according to\r\nBracton, is a dwelling-House consisting of one or more tenements.\r\n\r\n{220a}  “Britannia,” p. 742.  His name, as “Terrius de Bevra,” (Bevere,\r\nor Bever-lee in Holderness), he holding the Seigniory of that country,\r\nappears among the “Milites Flandriæ” in the rolls of Ban and Arriere Ban,\r\nin the time of Philip Augustus.  To show that he was of a somewhat\r\noverbearing spirit, it is related of him, that the Conqueror, having\r\nbestowed upon him the lordship of Holderness, he was not content with\r\nthat, but claimed all the land held by the church of St. John (now the\r\nMinster) at Beverley, with which it had been endowed by the King.\r\n\r\n{220b}  “Linc.

The above Burgavenny should be Abergavenny, in\r\nSouth Wales, but both forms were used.\r\n\r\n{222}  A similar thoroughfare formerly existed through the tower of the\r\nold All Saints’ Church at Cambridge, and there is still one through the\r\ntower of the church at March.\r\n\r\n{223}  In the church at Walton-on-Thames there is preserved in the\r\nvestry, a scold’s bridle: two flat steel bands, which go over the head,\r\nface, and round the nose, with a flat piece going into the mouth and\r\nfixing the tongue.  It locks at the back of the head.  It bears this\r\ninscription:—\r\n\r\n    Chester presents Walton with a bridle\r\n    To curb women’s tongues that be idle;\r\n\r\nthe said Chester being, it is said, a man who lost money through a\r\ntalkative woman of Walton.  An engraving of a “brancks” is given in the\r\nvolume of the Archæological Institute for 1848, p. 211.  It was\r\nexhibited, by Col. Jarvis of Doddington, at Lincoln, on the visit of the\r\nInstitute to that city.\r\n\r\n{228}  River names, as Taylor, in his “Words and Places” (p. 130), tells\r\nus, are almost invariably of Celtic, _i.e._ British, origin.  “Ban” means\r\nbright, or clear, and is found not only in our Bain, but in several other\r\nrivers.  There is a Bain in Hertfordshire, a Ben in Co. Mayo, Bandon in\r\nCo. Cork, Bann in Co. Wexford, Bana Co. Down, Bannon (or Ban-avon) in\r\nPembrokeshire, Banney in Yorkshire, &c.\r\n\r\n{229a}  “Britannia,” pp. 470, 471.\r\n\r\n{229b}  The name de Albini, corrupted into Daubeny survives, as a family\r\nname, and as a place-name in many localities.  In the writer’s own parish\r\nthere is a field called “Daubney’s Walk,” and a small stream named\r\n“Daubney’s Beck.”\r\n\r\n{229c}  The Patent Roll, 15 Henry III., m. 2, gives this: Pro Roberto de\r\nTatteshale—Rex concessit Roberto de Tatteshale quod libere et sine\r\nimpedimento unam domum de petra et calce firmari faciat apud manerium\r\nsuum de Tatteshal.

Brooke, Lincoln; and a full description is given\r\nby the late Bishop Suffragan, E. Trollope, in the “Architectural\r\nSociety’s Journal,” 1858, in a Paper on “The Use and Abuse of Red\r\nBricks.”\r\n\r\n{232}  Mr. H. Preston, F.G.S., of Grantham, examined these on the visit\r\nof the Linc. Naturalists’ Union to Tumby in the autumn of 1898, and gave\r\nthis as his opinion.\r\n\r\n{233}  Allen, in his “History of Lincolnshire,” states that these conical\r\nroofs remained in the thirties, but they were there at least ten years\r\nlater, to the writer’s own knowledge.\r\n\r\n{236}  At Revesby there is St. Sythe’s Lawn, where the Abbot of that\r\nmonastery used to reside, and some of the carving from his residence is\r\nstill preserved in the very handsome new church erected there by the late\r\nRight Honourable E. Stanhope.  In Mells church, Somerset, in the coloured\r\nglass of a window, St. Sitha is also represented with two keys in one\r\nhand and three loaves in the other.  She was slain by the Danes about\r\nA.D. 870.  (“Archæol. Journal,” No. 6, June, 1845).\r\n\r\n{238}  Toll-bars are not always so successfully negotiated.  The writer,\r\nwhen at Cambridge, had three college acquaintances who, on one\r\noccasion—_contra leges_—attended Newmarket races.  Riding home in the\r\ndusk, they found the toll-bar closed, and charged it.  The first of them\r\ncleared it successfully; the second, rather a bulky man, rode at it, but\r\nthe horse stopped short and he himself shot over, without it.  The third\r\ntook the gate, but the horse and rider fell together, and he was carried\r\ninto the bar-house insensible, to be presently found there, and taken\r\nhome _by the Proctor_, who had been looking for them.  He, however,\r\nproved a friend in need and in deed, for he kept council, and did not\r\ndivulge the incident.  A future clergyman, afterwards residing in this\r\nneighbourhood, attempted the same feat, but suffered for it ever\r\nafterwards.  A screw was left loose in his cranium, and he might\r\nsometimes be seen riding along the ditches by the roadside rather than on\r\nthe road itself.  His horse, however, and he, as should always be the\r\ncase, thoroughly understood each other, and did not “fall out,” or in.\r\n\r\n{239a}  “Quarterly Review,” July, 1891, p. 127.\r\n\r\n{239b}  A volume was published by the Lincolnshire Architectural Society,\r\nin 1846 (J.

Quoted by Oliver, “Religious Houses,” p. 52, note\r\n68.  The corruption which was gradually eating its way into the monastic\r\nlife came, in some cases, to be felt by those who were admitted to their\r\nintimacy.  The author of a poem contemporary with Chaucer, in the 14th\r\ncentury, says,\r\n\r\n    I was a friere ful many a day,\r\n    Therefor the soth I wot;\r\n    But when I saw that their lyvinge\r\n    Accorded not to their prechynge,\r\n    Of I cast my friere clothynge,\r\n    And wyghtly went my way.\r\n\r\nQuoted, Jusseraud’s “Way-faring Life of 14th Century.”\r\n\r\n{243b}  Cottonian MS. “Cleopatra,” E.\r\n\r\n{244a}  Cowper, “The Task,” 1. 206.\r\n\r\n{244b}  “Quarterly Review,” July, 1891, p. 126.\r\n\r\n{246}  Referring to these portions of screen, Mr. G. E. Jeans, author of\r\n“Murray’s Handbook to Lincolnshire,” says “Kirkstead Abbey, most valuable\r\nEarly English screen, one of the earliest in England” (“Lincs. N. & Q.,”\r\nvol. ii., p. 91).  Also Dr. Mansel Sympson, in a Paper on “Lincolnshire\r\nRood Screens,” read before the Architectural Society, June, 1890, goes\r\ninto further detail.  He says, “It is composed of 13 bays.  Each bay\r\nconsists of a lancet-headed trefoil, supported by octagonal pillars, with\r\nmoulded capitals and bases . . . total height 2ft. 9in.  Some screen-work\r\nexists in Rochester Cathedral of exactly the same character.”  And the\r\nlate Mr. Bloxam gave a drawing of a similar specimen in Thurcaston\r\nChurch, Leicestershire.  That at Stanton Harcourt, Oxfordshire, is not\r\nquite similar, and is 40 or 50 years later (1260); so that we may be\r\nproud of possessing, at Kirkstead, almost the oldest fragment of work, in\r\nthis particular line, in the country.
