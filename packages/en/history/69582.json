What then justifies the present writer in\r\npublishing another?\r\n\r\nHampson’s, ready for the press when Wesley died, is extremely meagre,\r\nand was the work of an angry writer. Coke and Moore’s, issued in 1792,\r\nwas a hasty publication, written _currente calamo_, to get possession\r\nof the market; and, like most things done in haste, was exceedingly\r\nimperfect. Whitehead’s, dated 1793-6, was composed in the midst of\r\ndisgraceful contentions, and was tinged with party feeling. Southey’s,\r\nprinted in 1820, has literary charms; but, unintentionally, is full\r\nof errors, and, for want of dates and chronological exactitude, is\r\nextremely confusing. Moore’s, published in 1824, is the fullest\r\nand most reliable; but, to a great extent, it is a mere reprint of\r\nWhitehead’s, given to the public about thirty years previously.\r\nWatson’s, issued in 1831, was not intended to supersede larger\r\npublications, but was “contracted within moderate limits, and” avowedly\r\n“prepared with special reference to general readers.”\r\n\r\nThese are the chief Lives of Wesley. Smaller ones are too numerous to\r\nbe mentioned; and, besides that, they are not _lives_, but _sketches_.\r\n\r\nThe publications of Hampson, of Coke and Moore, of Whitehead, and\r\nof Moore, have long been out of print. Two Lives are still on\r\nsale,—Southey’s and Watson’s; but the former is defective in details,\r\nand is incorrect and misleading; and the latter, as already stated, was\r\nnever meant to occupy the place of a larger work.\r\n\r\nIt has long been confessed that a Life of Wesley, worthy of the man,\r\nis a desideratum. Hampson, Coke, Moore, and Whitehead used, with a\r\nsparing hand, the materials which were already accessible to all, and\r\nadded a few original papers, for the preservation of which every one\r\nfeels grateful. Southey acknowledges that he “had no private sources\r\nof information”; and, in the list of books from which his materials\r\nwere chiefly taken, we find nothing but what is in the hands of most\r\nMethodist students. Watson says, he had “the advantage of consulting\r\nunpublished papers”; but it is not injustice to Watson, to say that\r\nvery few of these “unpublished papers” were embodied in his book.\r\n\r\nThis is not ill natured depreciation of previous biographers, all of\r\nwhom I revere, and wish to honour. But any ordinary reader, who will\r\ntake the trouble, may easily perceive, that the Lives of Wesley that\r\nhave been published, during the last seventy-six years, have contained\r\nno additional information worth naming.\r\n\r\nIn this interval, Wesley has yearly been growing in historic fame,\r\nuntil he is now, among all parties,—Churchmen, Methodists and\r\nDissenters, papists, protestants and infidels, statesmen, philosophers\r\nand men of letters,—one of the greatest and most interesting studies\r\nof the age. The world wishes to know something more respecting the\r\nman, who, under God, was the means of bringing about the greatest\r\nreformation of modern times. Since the publications of Whitehead,\r\nCoke and Moore—his literary executors—innumerable letters and other\r\nmanuscripts have come to light; but no subsequent biographer has used\r\nthem. Besides, in the magazines, newspapers, broadsheets, pamphlets,\r\ntracts, and songs, published during Wesley’s lifetime, there is a mine\r\nof biographical material incalculably rich; but, hitherto, no one has\r\ntaken the trouble to delve and to explore it.\r\n\r\nOught this apathy and negligence to continue longer? Is it right to\r\nkeep the world, the church, and especially the Methodists, in ignorance\r\nof what exists concerning one of the most remarkable men that ever\r\nlived? I think not; and, hence, as no one else attempted it, I have\r\ndone my best to collect these scattered facts, and to give them to the\r\npublic in the following volumes.\r\n\r\nFor seventeen years, materials have been accumulating in my hands.\r\nMy own mass of original manuscripts is large. Thousands of Methodist\r\nletters have been lent to me. Hundreds, almost thousands, of\r\npublications, issued in Wesley’s lifetime, and bearing on the great\r\nMethodist movement, have been consulted. Many of Wesley’s letters,\r\nhitherto published only in periodicals, or in scarce books, have been\r\nused; and not a few that, up to the present, have never yet appeared\r\nin print. To mention all who have rendered me generous assistance is\r\nalmost impossible; but I cannot deny myself the pleasure of naming the\r\nlate Rev. Joseph Entwisle, Mr. Joseph Miller, of Newcastle, Mr. George\r\nStevenson, of Paternoster Row, and last, but not least, the Rev. Elijah\r\nHoole, D.D., for the ready access he gave me to the collection of\r\nmanuscripts in the Wesleyan Mission House.\r\n\r\nMy greatest difficulty has been, not the want of materials, but that\r\nof making selections, and of giving in a condensed form all that I\r\nthought important. Nothing, likely to be of general interest, has been\r\nwithheld. Nothing, derogatory to the subject of these memoirs, has been\r\nkept back. Whatever else the work may be, it is _honest_.\r\n\r\nI have tried to make Wesley his own biographer. I have not attempted\r\nwhat may be called the _philosophy_ of Wesley’s life. I leave that to\r\nothers. As a rule, intelligent readers wish only to be possessed of\r\nfacts. They can form their own conclusions; and care but little about\r\nthe opinions of those by whom the facts are collected and narrated.\r\nThe temptation to moralise has oft been great; but I have tried to\r\npractise self denial. Wesley was not a _designing_ man: cunning he had\r\nnone: he was a man of one idea: his sole aim was to save souls. This\r\nwas the philosophy of his life. All his actions had reference to this.\r\nHe had no preconceived plans; and, hence, it is needless to speculate\r\nabout his motives. The man is best known by what he _did_; not by what\r\nphilosophers may suspect he _thought_. Holding these opinions, my one\r\nobject has been to collect, collate, and register unvarnished facts;\r\nand I hope I have not altogether failed.\r\n\r\nMuch that is false, or erroneous, concerning Wesley, has been\r\npublished; and it would have been an easy task to have refuted not a\r\nfew of the statements which even Methodists as well as others have\r\nbeen accustomed to receive without gainsaying; but I had no room for\r\nthis. Besides, I had no wish to assume the part of a controversialist.\r\nComparison will show, that, in several instances, I differ from\r\nprevious biographers; but I would rather that the reader should\r\ndiscover this for himself, than that I should state it. It may savour\r\nof unpardonable temerity to disagree with the distinguished men who\r\nhave gone before me; but, if attacked, I am prepared to defend the\r\nground that I have taken. To avoid encumbering the margin, I have\r\nomitted thousands of references; but I have them, and can give them, if\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe work has been arduous; but it has been a work of love. I have not\r\ndone what I wished, but what I could. A more literary and philosophic\r\nwriter might have been employed; but no labour has been spared in\r\npursuit of facts, and there has been no tampering with honour and\r\nhonesty in stating them.\r\n\r\nThe Portrait inserted in Vol. I. is taken from an exceedingly scarce\r\nengraving, published in 1743, and made from a painting by J. Williams.\r\nIt is more than probable that this was the first likeness of Wesley\r\never taken.\r\n\r\nI only add, that I hope the reader will find the general Index at the\r\nend of Vol. III. to be accurate and useful.\r\n\r\n    L.

Methodism has now existed one hundred and thirty\r\nyears. Is there any other system that has spread itself so widely in an\r\nequal period? We doubt it.\r\n\r\nIn the first two centuries of the Christian era, during a great part\r\nof which men were blessed with plenary inspiration, and miracles were\r\nwrought, the Christian religion sprung up in Judæa, Samaria, and\r\nGalilee. Churches were raised at Antioch, in the beautiful isle of\r\nCyprus, in the neighbouring provinces of Pamphylia, and Pisidia, and\r\nLycaonia, and Galatia, and Phrygia, and, in fact, throughout Asia Minor\r\nin general. Berea, Philippi, Thessalonica, Athens, Corinth, and other\r\ncities in Greece, were visited with the light of truth. Christianity\r\nthen spread through a large portion of other parts of the Roman empire,\r\nand reached as far as even Lyons in France.\r\n\r\nThis was marvellous success; but, as it respects geographical extent,\r\nthe spread of Methodism is more marvellous. The Roman empire embraced\r\nthe whole of the places above mentioned. It extended three thousand\r\nmiles in length and two thousand miles in breadth, and comprised the\r\nmost fertile and best cultivated part of the known world. Its limits\r\nwere the Atlantic on the west; the Rhine and Danube on the north;\r\nthe Euphrates on the east; and the deserts of Arabia and Africa on\r\nthe south. This was a vast area; but, compared with that over which\r\nMethodism has spread itself during the last hundred and thirty years,\r\nit is insignificantly small. If Methodism does not exist in Palestine,\r\nAsia Minor, Arabia, Greece, or Egypt, it exists in Britain, France,\r\nGermany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and\r\nAfrica: and, passing to other regions which the Romans never trod,\r\nit has long since entered India and Ceylon; it has already won its\r\ntriumphs in the flowery land of the Chinese; it has a vast multitude of\r\nadherents in Australia, and the islands of the Pacific Ocean; in the\r\nWest Indies its converts are numbered by tens of thousands; while in\r\nAmerica it has diffused its blessings from the most remote settlements\r\nof Canada in the north to the Gulf of Mexico in the south, and from\r\nNova Scotia in the east to California in the west.\r\n\r\n    “See how great a flame aspires,\r\n      Kindled by a spark of grace;\r\n    Jesu’s love the nations fires,\r\n      Sets the kingdoms on a blaze.”\r\n\r\nTake another epoch of the church’s history—the Reformation, begun by\r\nLuther, in the year 1517. This immense revival of truth and godliness,\r\nin the midst of a corrupted church, established itself in many parts\r\nof the German empire, where it continues to the present day. It was\r\npropagated in Sweden by one of Luther’s disciples, Olaus Petri. In\r\nDenmark, it was spread by Martin Reinard and Carlostadt. In France,\r\nit found a patroness in Margaret, Queen of Navarre. In Switzerland,\r\nJohn Calvin became famous as one of its great apostles. It made\r\nconsiderable progress in Spain, Hungary, Bohemia, and Poland. In the\r\nNetherlands, upwards of a hundred thousand persons were cruelly put to\r\ndeath because of their embracing it. In all the provinces of Italy,\r\nbut more especially in the territories of Venice, Tuscany, and Naples,\r\ngreat numbers of people, of all ranks, were led by it to express an\r\naversion to the Papal yoke. In Spain, not a few embraced it, and even\r\nCharles V. himself is presumed to have died a Protestant. In England,\r\nHenry VIII. unintentionally helped it forward by usurping the chair of\r\nchurch supremacy, hitherto occupied by his holiness the Pope; while\r\nhis only son, King Edward VI., was its brightest ornament, and, in\r\nsome respects, its most effectual support. In Ireland, George Brown,\r\nArchbishop of Dublin, pulled down images, destroyed relics, and purged\r\nthe churches within his diocese from superstitious rites. While in\r\nScotland, John Knox, a disciple of Calvin, launched his thunders\r\nagainst the Vatican, until he shook it to its base; and, at last,\r\nQueen Elizabeth, by an army, put an end to Popery in the whole of the\r\nCaledonian kingdom.\r\n\r\nThis was a glorious and wide-spread work, the blessed results of which\r\nwill be felt to the latest generations. But compare it with Methodism,\r\nand say which, in the same number of years, made the greater progress,\r\nand established itself in the widest extent of country. It is no\r\ndisparagement to the Protestant Reformation to affirm that, in this\r\nrespect, Methodism is immensely its superior.\r\n\r\nLook at this religious system as it now exists. The “Methodist,” or\r\nparent “Conference,” employs in Great Britain and Ireland 1782 regular\r\nministers. Besides these, there were, in 1864, in England only, 11,804\r\nlay preachers, preaching 8754 sermons every sabbath-day. In the same\r\nyear, the number of preaching places in England only, was 6718, and\r\nthe number of sermons preached weekly, by ministers and lay preachers\r\ncombined, was 13,852.[1] To these must be added the lay preachers,\r\npreaching places, etc., in Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Shetland, and the\r\nChannel Islands. The number of church members in Great Britain and\r\nIreland is 365,285, with 21,223 on trial; and, calculating that the\r\nhearers are three times as numerous as the church members, there are\r\nconsiderably more than a million persons in the United Kingdom who are\r\nattendants upon the religious services of the _parent_ Conference of\r\n“the people called Methodists.” Some idea of their chapel and school\r\nproperty may be formed from the fact that, during the last seven years,\r\nthere has been expended, in Great Britain only, in new erections and\r\nin reducing debts on existing buildings, £1,672,541; and, towards\r\nthat amount of expenditure, there has been actually raised and paid\r\n(exclusive of all Connexional collections, loans, and grants) the sum\r\nof £1,284,498. During the ten years, from 1859 to 1868 inclusive, there\r\nwas raised for the support of the foreign missions of the Connexion\r\n£1,408,235; and, if to this there be added the amount of the Jubilee\r\nFund, we find more than a million and a half sterling contributed\r\nduring the decade for the sustenance and extension of the Methodist\r\nwork in foreign lands. The missions now referred to are carried on\r\nin Ireland, France, Switzerland, Germany, Italy, Gibraltar, India,\r\nCeylon, China, South and West Africa, the West Indies, Canada, Eastern\r\nBritish America, Australia, and Polynesia. In these distant places,\r\nthe committee having the management of the missions employ 3798 paid\r\nagents, including 994 who are regularly ordained, and are wholly\r\nengaged in the work of the Christian ministry. Besides these, there are\r\nabout 20,000 agents of the Society (as lay preachers, etc.), who are\r\nrendering important service gratuitously; while the number of church\r\nmembers is 154,187, and the number of attendants upon the religious\r\nservices more than half a million. Space prevents a reference to the\r\nother institutions and funds of British Methodism, except to add that,\r\nbesides 174,721 children in the mission schools, the parent Connexion\r\nhas in Great Britain 698 day-schools, efficiently conducted by 1532\r\ncertificated, assistant, and pupil teachers, and containing 119,070\r\nscholars; also 5328 Sunday-schools, containing 601,801 scholars, taught\r\nby 103,441 persons who render their services gratuitously; and that the\r\ntotal number of publications printed and issued by the English Book\r\nCommittee only, during the year ending June 1866, was four millions\r\none hundred and twenty-two thousand eight hundred, of which nearly two\r\nmillions were periodicals, and more than a quarter of a million were\r\nhymn-books.\r\n\r\nThese statistics are significant of great facts. At a moderate\r\ncomputation, there are at least two millions of persons regularly\r\nworshipping in the chapels, schools, etc., of the original body of “the\r\npeople called Methodists.”\r\n\r\nLeaving what is sometimes called the “Old Connexion,” we proceed to\r\nglance at the _branches_ of the Methodist family.\r\n\r\n_The Welsh Calvinistic Methodists._—The societies of this section of\r\nMethodists were founded by Howel Harris, an early friend and companion\r\nof Wesley and Whitefield, and principally exist in Wales. At the census\r\nof 1851, they had 828 chapels, capable of accommodating about 212,000\r\npersons, and which had cost nearly a million sterling. In 1853 they\r\nhad 207 ministers, 234 lay preachers, and 58,577 church members. _The\r\nCountess of Huntingdon’s Connexion._—In 1748 Whitefield became the\r\nchaplain of the Countess of Huntingdon, who, by his advice, assumed\r\na kind of leadership over his followers, erected chapels, engaged\r\nministers or laymen to officiate in them, and afterwards founded\r\na college at Trevecca, in Wales, for the education of Calvinistic\r\npreachers. At her death, the college was transferred to Cheshunt, and\r\nthere it still exists. Although the name “Connexion” continues to be\r\nused, the Congregational polity is practically adopted; and, of late\r\nyears, several of the congregations have become, in name as well as\r\nvirtually, Congregational churches. The number of chapels, mentioned in\r\nthe census of 1851, as belonging to this Connexion, was 109, containing\r\naccommodation for 38,727 persons, and the attendance on the census\r\nSunday was 19,159.[2]\r\n\r\n_The Methodist New Connexion_ was formed in the year 1797; the\r\nprincipal, if not only difference, between it and the parent body,\r\nbeing the different degrees of power allowed in each communion to the\r\nlaity. At the Conference of 1869, the New Connexion had, at home and\r\nabroad, 260 ministers, and 35,706 church members.\r\n\r\n_The Band Room Methodists_ had their origin in Manchester, in 1806.\r\nTheir chief leaders were John and E. Broadhurst, Holland Hoole,\r\nNathaniel Williamson, and Thomas Painter. Of the earnestness of these\r\ngodly men there can be no question; but, as in the case of many who\r\nhave been called revivalists, their zeal was often boisterous and\r\nirregular, and sometimes obstinate. Their meetings were chiefly held in\r\nwhat was known as the Band Room, in North Street. Their chief faults\r\nwere admitting persons to band meetings without showing their society\r\ntickets; having penitent benches and noisy prayer-meetings; holding\r\ncottage services; and, lastly and especially, acting independently\r\nof leaders’ meetings. The Band Room Methodists still exist; but are\r\nnow called, “The United Free Gospel Churches.” They hold annual\r\nconferences; have fifty-nine churches, chiefly in Lancashire and\r\nYorkshire; and differ from the parent Connexion, not in doctrines, but\r\nin having no paid ministers.\r\n\r\n_The Primitive Methodists_ sprang up in Staffordshire in 1810. The\r\ndoctrines they teach are precisely similar to those of the original\r\nConnexion. At the conference of 1868 they had, at home and abroad, 943\r\nministers, about 14,000 lay preachers, nearly 10,000 classleaders,\r\n3360 connexional chapels, 2963 rented chapels and rooms for religious\r\nworship, 3282 Sunday-schools, above 40,000 Sunday-school teachers,\r\n258,857 Sunday-school scholars, and 161,229 church members.\r\n\r\n_The Bible Christians_, sometimes called “Bryanites,” were founded\r\nby William O’Bryan, a Wesleyan local preacher, in Cornwall, in 1815.\r\nThey principally exist in Cornwall and the West of England, but also\r\nhave mission stations in the Channel Islands, the United States,\r\nCanada, Prince Edward’s Island, and Australia. Like the parent\r\nConnexion they have class-meetings, circuits, district-meetings, and\r\na Conference. Their statistics, for 1869, are about 700 chapels and\r\n300 other preaching places, 254 ministers, 1759 lay preachers, 44,221\r\nSunday-school scholars, 8913 Sunday-school teachers, and 26,241 full\r\nand accredited church members.\r\n\r\n_The Primitive Methodists in Ireland_ seceded from the parent body in\r\n1817. At that time the Irish Conference, at the urgent request of many\r\nof the Irish societies, agreed that the ministers in full connection\r\nshould administer the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s supper, in\r\ncircuits making proper application to that effect. This occasioned\r\ngreat commotion. A number of leaders and local preachers assembled at\r\nClones, in the beginning of 1817, and formed themselves into a separate\r\nConnexion, the only difference between them and their quondam friends\r\nbeing, that their ministers should not administer baptism and the\r\nLord’s supper, but should leave their societies at perfect liberty to\r\npartake of those sacraments in the churches to which they respectively\r\nbelonged. In 1816 there were in Ireland 28,542 members of society;\r\nbut in two years, and in consequence of this senseless schism, that\r\nnumber was reduced to 19,052. The new body took the name of Primitive\r\nMethodists, and still continue a separated people on the one principle\r\nalready mentioned. In 1861, they had in Ireland, 61 circuits, 85\r\nministers, and 14,247 members of society.\r\n\r\n_The United Methodist Free Churches_ are an amalgamation of three\r\ndifferent secessions from the original Connexion, 1. The Protestant\r\nMethodists, who were formed into a distinct body in 1828, when upwards\r\nof 1000 members separated from the Leeds societies, because of the\r\nproceedings of the special district-meeting convened to settle the\r\ndisputes arising out of the introduction of an organ into Brunswick\r\nChapel. 2. The Wesleyan Methodist Association, which sprung out of\r\nthe controversy in 1834, concerning the then proposed Theological\r\nInstitution. 3. The Reformers, who were expelled, or who seceded,\r\nduring the terrible agitation which occurred in 1849. These amalgamated\r\nbodies have, in 1869, ministers, 312; lay preachers, 3445; chapels,\r\n1228; Sunday-scholars, 152,315; church members, 68,062.\r\n\r\n_The Wesleyan Reform Union_ consists of those Reformers of 1849 who\r\nrefused to amalgamate with the United Methodist Free Churches. In\r\n1868, the Union had 20 ministers, 608 lay preachers, 276 chapels and\r\npreaching places, 580 classleaders, 18,475 Sunday-scholars, and 9393\r\nchurch members.\r\n\r\nThe above comprise all the Methodist bodies now existing in the United\r\nKingdom. Some others have occasionally sprung up, such as the _Tent\r\nMethodists_, the _Independent Methodists_, etc.; but they are now\r\neither extinct or incorporated with other churches. Not reckoning the\r\nBand Room Methodists, nor the Countess of Huntingdon’s Connexion, and\r\nmaking a moderate _estimate_ of the Sunday-school scholars belonging\r\nto the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists and to the Primitive Methodists in\r\nIreland, we arrive at the following results.\r\n\r\n┌─────────────────────────┬────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────────┐\r\n│                         │            │ Number of   │   Number of     │\r\n│                         │ Number of  │   church    │  Sunday-school  │\r\n│     Denomination.       │ ministers. │   members.  │    scholars.    │\r\n├─────────────────────────┼────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────────┤\r\n│ Wesleyan Methodists     │   3157     │    557,995  │    776,522      │\r\n│ Welsh Calvinistic ditto │    207     │     58,577  │     80,000 about│\r\n│ New Connexion ditto     │    260     │     35,706  │     50,000 about│\r\n│ Primitive ditto         │    943     │    161,229  │    258,857      │\r\n│ Ditto (Ireland) ditto   │     85     │     14,247  │     20,000 about│\r\n│ Bible Christians        │    254     │     26,241  │     44,221      │\r\n│ United Methodist Free   │            │             │                 │\r\n│   Churches              │    312     │     68,062  │    152,315      │\r\n│ Wesleyan Reform Union   │     20     │      9,393  │     18,475      │\r\n│                         ├────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────────┤\r\n│         Totals          │   5238     │    931,450  │  1,400,390      │\r\n└─────────────────────────┴────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\nMarvellous, however, as the success of Methodism has been in the\r\nUnited Kingdom, it has been far more marvellous in the United States.\r\nThere it holds and preaches precisely the same doctrines as are held\r\nand preached in England. There, as here, it is intensely loyal; and,\r\nduring the late terrific war, sent a hundred thousand white, and\r\nseventy-five thousand, black troops into the field of battle under the\r\nloyal flag. It is dotting the whole of the vast American continent with\r\nits church edifices, and has perhaps the most powerful religious press\r\nof which the world can boast.

It also has a great Missionary Society, with prosperous\r\nmissions in China, India, Africa, Bulgaria, Germany, Switzerland,\r\nDenmark, Norway, Sweden, and other places.\r\n\r\nThe returns for _the Methodist Episcopal Church South_, in 1869, are\r\n2581 ministers, 3951 lay preachers, and 535,040 church members.\r\n\r\n_The Methodist Episcopal Church_ in Canada has 216 ministers, 224 lay\r\npreachers, and 20,000 members.\r\n\r\nBesides the above, there are other Transatlantic Methodists, as:—1.\r\nThe African Methodist Episcopal Church, which, in 1867, had 14\r\nannual Conferences, 673 chapels, 509 travelling preachers, 727 local\r\npreachers, 130,950 members, 33,134 Sunday-school scholars, and 40,716\r\nvolumes in Sunday-school libraries. 2. The Methodist Protestant Church,\r\nwith about 90,000 members. 3. The American Wesleyan Methodists, with\r\nabove 20,000 members. 4. The German Methodists, with 46,000 members.\r\n5. Three or four smaller sects, which need no further notice. The\r\naggregate membership of these several Methodistic bodies may be fairly\r\nestimated at about 300,000, and their ministers and preachers at 5000.\r\n\r\nThese are startling figures; put together in an abbreviated form, they\r\nstand as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n┌───────────────────────┬────────────────┬────────────┬───────────────┐\r\n│                       │   Ministers    │            │               │\r\n│                       │  exclusive of  │   Church   │ Sunday-school │\r\n│                       │local preachers.│  members.  │   scholars.   │\r\n├───────────────────────┼────────────────┼────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n│ Great Britain,        │                │            │               │\r\n│   including Missions  │      5238      │   931,450  │     1,400,390 │\r\n│ American Methodist    │                │            │               │\r\n│   Episcopal Church    │                │            │               │\r\n│   North               │      8840      │ 1,114,712  │     1,179,984 │\r\n│ Ditto South           │      2581      │   535,040  │ say   500,000 │\r\n│ Ditto Canada          │       216      │    20,000  │ say    20,000 │\r\n│ Other American        │                │            │               │\r\n│   Methodists          │      5000      │   300,000  │ say   300,000 │\r\n│                       ├────────────────┼────────────┼───────────────┤\r\n│        Totals         │    21,875      │ 2,901,202  │     3,400,374 │\r\n└───────────────────────┴────────────────┴────────────┴───────────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of these figures are _estimated_ numbers, and are so given; the\r\nothers are statistics officially reported. Put the matter in another\r\nform. Is it too much to calculate Methodist _hearers only_ at the rate\r\nof twice the number of Methodist church members? If not, the estimated\r\nresult is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Church members throughout the world        2,901,202\r\n    Sunday scholars                            3,400,373\r\n    Hearers only                               5,802,404\r\n                                               ─────────\r\n                                       Total  12,103,979\r\n\r\nWe thus make a total of more than twelve millions of persons receiving\r\nMethodist instruction, and, from week to week, meeting together in\r\nMethodist buildings for the purpose of worshipping Almighty God. The\r\nstatement is startling, but the statistics given entitle it to the\r\nfullest consideration.\r\n\r\nBut rightly to estimate the results of Methodism during the last\r\nhundred and thirty years, there are other facts to be remembered.\r\n\r\nWho will deny, for instance, that Methodism has exercised a potent and\r\nbeneficial influence upon other churches: Episcopal, Presbyterian,\r\nIndependent, and Baptist churches have all been largely indebted\r\nto Methodism, either directly or indirectly, for many of the best\r\nministers and agents they have ever had. It is a remarkable fact\r\nthat, during Wesley’s lifetime, of the 690 men who acted under him\r\nas itinerant preachers, 249 relinquished the itinerant ministry.\r\nThese 249 _retirers_ included not a few of the most intelligent,\r\nenergetic, pious, and useful preachers that Wesley had. Some left him\r\non the ground of health; others began business, because as itinerant\r\npreachers they were unable to support their wives and families; but a\r\nlarge proportion became ordained ministers in other churches. In some\r\ninstances, the labours of these men, and their brother Methodists,\r\nled to marvellous results. To give but one example,—David Taylor,\r\noriginally a servant of Lady Huntingdon, was one of Wesley’s first\r\npreachers, but afterwards left the work. Taylor, however, was the\r\nmeans of converting Samuel Deacon, an agricultural labourer; and the\r\ntwo combined were the instruments, in the hands of God, of raising up\r\na number of churches in Yorkshire and the midland counties, which,\r\nin 1770, were organised into the New Connexion of General Baptists;\r\nand that Connexion, seventy years afterwards, in 1840, comprised 113\r\nchurches, having 11,358 members, a foreign missionary society, and two\r\ntheological academies.[3]\r\n\r\n_Sunday-schools_ are now an important appendage of every church, and\r\nhave been a benefit to millions of immortal souls; but it deserves to\r\nbe mentioned that Hannah Ball, a young Methodist lady, had a Methodist\r\nSunday-school at High Wycombe fourteen years before Robert Raikes\r\nbegan his at Gloucester; and that Sophia Cooke, another Methodist,\r\nwho afterwards became the wife of Samuel Bradburn, was the first who\r\nsuggested to Raikes the Sunday-school idea, and actually marched with\r\nhim, at the head of his troop of ragged urchins, the first Sunday they\r\nwere taken to the parish church.\r\n\r\nThe first _British Bible Society_ that existed, “The Naval and\r\nMilitary,” was projected by George Cussons, and organised by a small\r\nnumber of his Methodist companions. The _London Missionary Society_\r\noriginated in an appeal from Melville Horne, who, for some years, was\r\none of Wesley’s itinerant preachers, and then became the successor\r\nof Fletcher as vicar of Madeley. The _Church Missionary Society_ was\r\nstarted by John Venn, the son of Henry Venn the Methodist clergyman.\r\nThe first _Tract Society_ was formed by John Wesley and Thomas Coke,\r\nin 1782, seventeen years before the organisation of the present great\r\nReligious Tract Society in Paternoster Row—a society, by the way,\r\nwhich was instituted chiefly by Rowland Hill, and two or three other\r\nCalvinistic Methodists. It is believed that the first _Dispensary_ that\r\nthe world ever had was founded by Wesley himself in connection with the\r\nold Foundery, in Moorfields. The _Strangers’ Friend Society_, paying,\r\nevery year, from forty to fifty thousand visits to the sick poor of\r\nLondon, and relieving them as far as possible, is an institution to\r\nwhich Methodism gave birth in 1785.\r\n\r\n_Building churches_ is one of the great features of the age.\r\nUnfortunately, England has had no religious worship census since\r\n1851; but even then, according to the tables of Horace Mann, Esq.,\r\nMethodism had, in England and Wales only, 11,835 places of worship,\r\nwith 2,231,017 sittings. In America, according to the census of 1860,\r\nMethodism nine years ago provided church accommodation for 6,259,799,\r\nwhich was two and a quarter millions more than was provided by any\r\nother church whatever.\r\n\r\nThe _public press_ is one of the most powerful institutions of the\r\nday. England has four Methodist newspapers; Ireland, one; France,\r\none; Germany, one; India, one; China, one; Australia, two; Canada and\r\nBritish America, five; and the United States about fifty.\r\n\r\nLet the reader think of twelve millions of people at present enjoying\r\nthe benefits of Methodist instruction; let him think of Methodism’s\r\n21,875 ordained ministers, and of its tens of thousands of lay\r\npreachers; let him think of the immense amount of its church property,\r\nand of the well-nigh countless number of its church publications;\r\nlet him think of millions of young people in its schools, and of its\r\nmissionary agents almost all the wide world over; let him think of its\r\nincalculable influence upon other churches, and of the unsectarian\r\ninstitutions to which it has given rise; and then let him say whether\r\nthe bold suggestion already made is not strictly true, viz., that\r\n“_Methodism is the greatest fact in the history of the church of\r\nChrist_.”\r\n\r\nHere we have an immensely ramified church organisation, everywhere\r\npreaching the same momentous doctrines, and aiming at the same great\r\npurpose. A day never passes without numbers of its converts being\r\nadmitted into heaven; and without many a poor wayward wanderer being\r\nbrought by it into the fold of Christ on earth. Thousands of its\r\ntemples are daily open; and “prayer,” by its churches, in one quarter\r\nof the globe or in another, is “made continually.” It has belted the\r\nentire planet with its myriad agents, who—in English, French, Dutch,\r\nGerman, and Italian; in the various dialects and tongues of Africa,\r\nIndia, and China; and in the newly formed languages of the Feegee and\r\nthe Friendly Islands—are calling to the nations, “Ho, every one that\r\nthirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money; come ye,\r\nbuy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without\r\nprice.”\r\n\r\nIn England, it has had much to do with the almost incredible changes\r\nthat have taken place in English society during the last hundred\r\nyears. In Ireland, with Popery so rampant, a people so poor, and\r\nemigration so vast, it has some five or six hundred chapels, besides\r\nhaving many hundreds of small congregations in cottages, court-houses,\r\nmarket-places, and village-greens. In Australia, it has more church\r\nsittings than any other Christian community, the Church of England not\r\nexcepted; and has, at least, one twelfth of the colonists attending its\r\nplaces of religious worship. In America, it has become the dominant\r\npopular faith of the country, with its standard planted in every\r\ncity, town, and almost every village of the land, and is building\r\nchapels at the rate of nearly two every day.[4] In the early period\r\nof its history, it had its fair share of persecution, and was, to an\r\nextent sufficient one would think to satisfy its founders, pelted and\r\nhooted by vulgar mobs, mistreated by magistrates and courts, reviled\r\nby religionists, and assailed by swarms of pamphleteers; it has had\r\nno national endowments, and has had no favour from parliamentary\r\nlegislation; it has had no assistance from the State, and has been\r\nlooked upon with supercilious contempt by what, in England, is called\r\n“the Church;” and yet despite all this, there is hardly a nation where\r\nits influence has not been felt; and instead of finding it maimed and\r\nlame and injured by fighting its past battles and winning its past\r\nvictories; or weak and palsied and inactive on account of approaching\r\nage, it has never been more vigorous, by the blessing of God, than it\r\nis at present; and is putting into motion an amount of machinery the\r\nultimate results of which no man’s mind can grasp.\r\n\r\nIs all this concerning Methodism strictly true? We believe it is, and\r\nhence we believe that the life of Methodism’s founder is a subject well\r\nworth knowing. Who was he? What was he? Who were his companions? When\r\nand where and how did he pass his time? We will try to show.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE LIFE AND TIMES\r\n                                  OF\r\n                      THE REV. JOHN WESLEY, M.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n             _WESLEY AT HOME, AT SCHOOL, AND AT COLLEGE._\r\n\r\n                              1703-1725.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1703]\r\n\r\nJOHN WESLEY was born at Epworth, in the county of Lincoln, on the 17th\r\nof June, 1703,[5] and was the son of Samuel and Susannah Wesley, the\r\nformer being the learned, laborious, and godly rector of the Epworth\r\nparish from about the year 1696 to his death in 1735. The Wesley family\r\nconsisted of nineteen children, but, of these, nine died in infancy.\r\nThe name of one of the dead infants was John, and the name of another\r\nBenjamin; and when the subject of this biography was born, his mother\r\nunited the two names by calling him John Benjamin. Second names are of\r\nlittle use, and are often troublesome, and probably for this reason\r\nWesley’s second name was one which he never used.[6]\r\n\r\nWhen Wesley was born, Queen Anne was commencing the twelve years of\r\nEnglish sovereignty which some have regarded as the Augustan age of\r\nEnglish learning. War was raging on the continent, and, at home, an\r\nembittered fight was being fought between fiery Churchmen and fierce\r\nDissenters. Anne warmly favoured the high church party; and to augment\r\nChurch livings, gave out of the royal income “the first-fruits and the\r\ntenths,” amounting to £16,000 a year. While Wesley was yet an infant,\r\nthe Whigs raised the cry of “the Church in danger,” but Parliament\r\npassed a resolution that the cry was unfounded, and that those who gave\r\nit birth were enemies to the queen, the Church, and the kingdom. Five\r\nyears after this, Dr. Sacheverell preached his firebrand sermon in St.\r\nPaul’s Cathedral, and threw the nation into a state of unparalleled\r\nexcitement, the ultimate result of which was, the Tories became more\r\npowerful than ever; and Queen Anne, in meeting her Parliament in 1710,\r\nno longer condescended to use the word _toleration_ in reference to\r\nDissenters, but spoke of _indulgence_ to be allowed “to scrupulous\r\nconsciences,” while, after a long continued struggle, the high church\r\nparty succeeded in passing the obnoxious bill against occasional\r\nconformity. All this occurred during Wesley’s childhood.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Wesley’s birth, his brother Samuel was a sprightly\r\nboy, thirteen years of age, and a few months afterwards was sent to\r\nWestminster School, where he became distinguished for his scholarship\r\nand genius, and soon obtained a host of literary friends, from Lord\r\nOxford, the Mecænas of his age, down to Addison, Atterbury, Pope, and\r\nPrior. Emilia Wesley, so gifted and so beautiful, was a year younger\r\nthan Samuel, and was developing her exquisite sensibility and taste\r\nunder the mental and moral cultivation of her mother. The ill-fated\r\nSusannah was a frolicsome child, eight years old. Mary, already\r\ndeformed by an early sickness and the carelessness of her nurse, had\r\narrived at the age of seven, and was fast becoming the favourite of\r\nher father’s family. The almost unequalled Mehetabel was six, and was\r\nso advanced in learning that two years afterwards she read the New\r\nTestament in Greek. Anne was yet an infant; and Martha, Charles, and\r\nKeziah were still unborn.\r\n\r\nIn the year of Wesley’s nativity, his father was writing his “History\r\nof the Old and New Testament, in Verse;” and also had the pleasure\r\nor mortification (we hardly know which) of having his pamphlet on\r\nDissenting academies surreptitiously published by a man to whom it had\r\nlong before been sent as a private letter. Before Wesley was three\r\nyears old his father was ruthlessly thrust into gaol for debt; and\r\nbefore he was six the parsonage was destroyed by fire. When the fire\r\noccurred, his brother Charles was an infant not two months old, and he,\r\nwith John, three of their sisters, and their nurse, were all in the\r\nsame room, and fast asleep. Being aroused, the nurse seized Charles,\r\nand bid the others follow. The three sisters did as they were bidden,\r\nbut John was left sleeping. The venerable rector counted heads, and\r\nfound John was wanting. At the same instant, a cry was heard. The\r\nfrantic father tried to ascend the burning stairs, but found it to be\r\nimpossible. He then dropped upon his knees in the blazing hall, and\r\ndespairing of the rescue of his child, commended him to God. Meanwhile\r\nJohn had mounted a chest and was standing at the bedroom window. Quick\r\nas thought, one man placed himself against the wall, and another stood\r\nupon his shoulders, and just a moment before the roof fell in with a\r\nfearful crash the child was rescued through the window, and safely\r\n“plucked as a brand from the burning” house.\r\n\r\nOur information respecting Wesley’s childhood is extremely limited. If\r\nwe strip off all the luxuriant verbiage in which imaginative writers\r\nhave indulged, the naked facts are the following.\r\n\r\nWesley, like all the other members of his father’s family, was indebted\r\nfor his elementary education to his mother. The principles upon which\r\nshe acted were unique. When the child was one year old, he was taught\r\nto fear the rod, and, if he cried at all, to cry in softened tones.\r\nWesley long afterwards, in his sermon on the education of children,\r\nenforces his mother’s practice, urging parents never to give a child\r\na thing for which it cries, on the ground that to do so would be a\r\nrecompence for crying, and he would certainly cry again.\r\n\r\nAnother of Mrs. Wesley’s principles of action was to limit her children\r\nto three meals a day. Eating and drinking between meals was strictly\r\nprohibited. All the children were washed and put to bed by eight\r\no’clock, and, on no account, was a servant to sit by a child till it\r\nfell asleep.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Wesley children were taught the Lord’s Prayer as\r\nsoon as they could speak, and repeated it every morning and every\r\nnight. Rudeness was never seen amongst them; and on no account were\r\nthey allowed to call each other by their proper names without the\r\naddition of brother or sister, as the case might be. Six hours a day\r\nwere spent at school; and loud talking, playing, and running into the\r\nyard, garden, or street, without permission, was rigorously forbidden.\r\nNone of them, except Kezzy, was taught to read till five years old,\r\nand then only a single day was allowed wherein to learn the letters of\r\nthe alphabet, great and small—a task which all of them accomplished\r\nexcept Mary and Anne, who were a day and a half before they knew them\r\nperfectly. Psalms were sung every morning when school was opened, and\r\nalso every night when the duties of the day were ended. In addition to\r\nall this, at the commencement and close of every day, each of the elder\r\nchildren took one of the younger and read the Psalms appointed for the\r\nday and a chapter in the Bible, after which they severally went to\r\ntheir private devotions.\r\n\r\nMrs. Wesley, assisted by her husband, seems to have been the sole\r\ninstructor of her daughters, and also of her sons, until the latter\r\nwere sent to school in London; and never was there a family of children\r\nwho did their teacher greater credit.\r\n\r\nFrom early childhood, John was remarkable for his sober and studious\r\ndisposition, and seemed to feel himself answerable to his reason and\r\nhis conscience for everything he did. He would do nothing without first\r\nreflecting on its fitness and propriety. If asked, out of the common\r\nway of meals, to have, for instance, a piece of bread or fruit, he\r\nwould answer with the coolest unconcern, “I thank you; I will think\r\nof it.” To argue about a thing seemed instinctive, and was carried to\r\nsuch a length that on one occasion his father almost chid him, saying,\r\n“Child, you think to carry everything by dint of argument; but you\r\nwill find how little is ever done in the world by close reasoning.”\r\n“I profess, sweetheart,” said the rector in a pet to Mrs. Wesley, “I\r\nprofess, sweetheart, I think our Jack would not attend to the most\r\npressing necessities of nature, unless he could give a reason for\r\nit.”[7]\r\n\r\nWith all this meditative reasoning, there was mixed devotion. It is a\r\nremarkable fact, scarce paralleled, that such was his consistency of\r\nconduct, that his father admitted him to the communion table when he\r\nwas only eight years old;[8] and he himself informs us that, until he\r\nwas about the age of ten, he had not sinned away that “washing of the\r\nHoly Ghost,” which he received in baptism.[9]\r\n\r\nBetween the age of eight and nine the small-pox attacked him; but he\r\nbore the terrible affliction with manly and Christian fortitude. At the\r\ntime, his father was in London, and his mother writing him remarks:\r\n“Jack has borne his disease bravely, like a man, and indeed like a\r\nChristian, without complaint.”[10]\r\n\r\nThis is all that is known respecting Wesley during his childhood years\r\nat Epworth. Imagination might conjure up his early thinkings, passions,\r\nand attachments, the localities he loved to visit, and the sports, fun,\r\nand frolic in which he occasionally indulged; but history, on such\r\nsubjects, is entirely silent; and for want of its honest statements we\r\nlook at him in the grave and sober aspect in which facts present him.\r\n\r\nWhile yet a child, only ten and a half years old, Wesley passed\r\nfrom under the tutelage of his accomplished mother, and became a\r\npupil at the Charterhouse, London. For his son’s admission into this\r\ndistinguished school, the Epworth rector was indebted to the friendly\r\nservices of the Duke of Buckingham, at that time the Lord Chamberlain\r\nof the royal household.[11]\r\n\r\nThe privilege was great, and, to the day of his death, John Wesley\r\nloved the place of his early education, and was accustomed to walk\r\nthrough its courts and grounds once every year. He was not without\r\nhardships; but he bore them bravely. Among other acts of cruelty, the\r\nelder boys were accustomed, in addition to their own share of animal\r\nfood, to take by force that which was apportioned to the younger\r\nscholars; and, in consequence of this, for a considerable part of the\r\nfive years that young Wesley spent at the Charterhouse, the only solid\r\nfood he got was bread. There was one thing, however, which contributed\r\nto his general flow of health,—namely, his invariably carrying out a\r\nstrict command which his father gave him, to run round the Charterhouse\r\ngarden three times every morning. It is good for a man “to bear the\r\nyoke in his youth,” and Wesley learned, as a boy, to suffer wrongfully\r\nwith a cheerful fortitude, and to submit to the cruel exactions of his\r\nelder tyrants without acquiring either the cringing of a slave or a\r\ndespot’s imperious temper.\r\n\r\nWesley entered the school as the poor child of an impoverished parish\r\npriest, and had to endure wrongs and insults neither few nor small;\r\nbut, though he was only sixteen years of age when he left, he had, by\r\nhis energy of character, his unconquerable patience, his assiduity, and\r\nhis progress in learning, acquired a high position among his fellows.\r\nAn old Methodist pamphlet[12] relates an anecdote, to the effect that\r\nthe Rev. A. Tooke,[13] master of the school, was struck with the fact\r\nthat, though Wesley was remarkably advanced in his studies, yet he\r\nconstantly associated with the inferior classes, and was accustomed\r\nto harangue a number of the smaller boys surrounding him. On one\r\noccasion Tooke broke in upon him in the midst of an oration, and\r\ninterrupted him, by desiring him to follow him into a private room.\r\nWesley reluctantly obeyed, and the master, addressing him, asked how\r\nit was that he was so often found among the boys of the lower forms,\r\nand sought not the company of the bigger boys, who were his equals? To\r\nwhich the young orator replied, “Better to rule in hell than to serve\r\nin heaven.”\r\n\r\nThis story was given by “an old member of society,” on what he calls\r\n“the most authentic authority,” for the purpose of showing that Wesley,\r\neven as a boy, was ambitious. Be it so. What then? Is ambition always,\r\nand under all circumstances, a thing to be denounced? Ambition is\r\nwidely different from vanity, a paltry passion of petty minds; neither\r\nis it necessarily accompanied with the use of improper means to attain\r\nits object. Ambition is common to the human species. There are but few\r\nwithout it, and who are not desirous of distinguishing themselves in\r\nthe circle in which they live. You see the passion in the aristocratic\r\nnoble toiling after a distinction which he desires to win; and you\r\nequally see it in the poorest mechanic, who strives to surround himself\r\nwith poor admirers, and who delights in the superiority which he\r\nenjoys over those who are, in some respects, beneath him. Besides, as\r\na rule, a man’s ambition is always in correspondence with his other\r\ntastes, and faculties, and powers. Dr. Johnson wisely remarks, that\r\n“Providence seldom sends any into the world with an inclination to\r\nattempt great things, who have not abilities likewise to perform them;”\r\nand Addison, an equally thoughtful student of human nature, observes\r\nthat “Men of the greatest abilities are most fired with ambition; and,\r\non the contrary, mean and narrow minds are the least actuated by it.”\r\nTo account for this may be difficult, but none will deny its truth.\r\nPerhaps the difference may be occasioned by a man’s consciousness of\r\nhis own capacities making him despair of attaining positions which\r\nothers reach; or perhaps, which is more likely still, Providence, in\r\nthe very framing of his mind, has freed him from a passion, which would\r\nbe useless to the world, and a torment to himself.\r\n\r\nOn such grounds, then, we are quite prepared to argue that, even\r\nallowing the above anonymous story to be strictly true, and allowing\r\nalso that it proves that Wesley as a boy was animated with ambition,\r\nthere is nothing in it which, for a moment, detracts from Wesley’s\r\nhonour and honest fame.\r\n\r\nWe wish that this were the only thing to be alleged against him during\r\nhis Charterhouse career. Unfortunately there is another fact far more\r\nserious; for Wesley, while at this seat of learning, lost the religion\r\nwhich had marked his character from the days of infancy. He writes\r\nconcerning this period of his history: “Outward restraints being\r\nremoved, I was much more negligent than before, even of outward duties,\r\nand almost continually guilty of outward sins, which I knew to be such,\r\nthough they were not scandalous in the eye of the world. However, I\r\nstill read the Scriptures, and said my prayers morning and evening.\r\nAnd what I now hoped to be saved by was,—1. Not being so bad as other\r\npeople. 2. Having still a kindness for religion. And, 3. Reading the\r\nBible, going to church, and saying my prayers.”[14]\r\n\r\nTerrible is the danger when a child leaves a pious home for a public\r\nschool. John Wesley entered the Charterhouse a saint, and left it a\r\nsinner.\r\n\r\nIt was during his residence at this celebrated school, that the\r\nmysterious and preternatural voices were heard in his father’s house.\r\nThe often told story need not be repeated; but there can be no question\r\nthat its influence upon himself was powerful and important. He took\r\nthe trouble of obtaining minute particulars from his mother, from his\r\nfour sisters, Emily, Mary, Susannah, and Anne, and from Robin Brown.\r\nHe likewise transcribed his father’s diary, containing an account of\r\nthe disturbances;[15] thereby showing the intense interest he felt\r\nin the affair. In fact, it would seem that, from this period, Wesley\r\nwas a firm believer in ghosts and apparitions. In his twentieth year,\r\nwe find him writing to his mother, in the gravest manner possible,\r\nconcerning what he calls “one of the most unaccountable stories he\r\nhad ever heard;”—namely, that of a lad in Ireland, who ever and anon\r\nmade an involuntary pilgrimage through the aerial regions, and feasted\r\nwith demigods _in nubibus_. In the same letter, Wesley relates an\r\nadventure of his own; for, while walking a few days previously in the\r\nneighbourhood of Oxford, he had observed a forlorn looking house,\r\nwhich he found was unoccupied by mortals because it was haunted\r\nby ghosts. Wesley tells his mother that he purposes to visit this\r\nforsaken dwelling, and to assure himself whether what he had heard was\r\ntrue. He further relates that a Mr. Barnesley, and two other of his\r\nfellow-students, had recently seen an apparition in a field adjoining\r\nOxford, and that it had since been ascertained that Barnesley’s\r\nmother died in Ireland at the very moment when the spectre had been\r\nwitnessed.[16]\r\n\r\nThus, at this early period of his history, Wesley’s mind, wisely or\r\nunwisely, superstitiously or otherwise, was full of the supernatural;\r\nand to the calm judgment of his philosophic mother he submits his\r\nfacts for her opinion. Three weeks afterwards she wrote:[17]—\r\n\r\n    “DEAR JACKY,—The story of Mr. Barnesley has afforded me many\r\n    curious speculations. I do not doubt the fact; but I cannot\r\n    understand why these apparitions are permitted. If they were\r\n    allowed to speak to us, and we had strength to bear such\r\n    converse,—if they had commission to inform us of anything\r\n    relating to their invisible world that would be of any use to\r\n    us in this,—if they would instruct us how to avoid danger,\r\n    or put us in a way of being wiser and better, there would be\r\n    sense in it; but to appear for no end that we know of, unless\r\n    to frighten people almost out of their wits, seems altogether\r\n    unreasonable.”\r\n\r\nThis was not a solution of Wesley’s difficulty. It was rather making\r\nmystery more mysterious. The young student was full of anxious inquiry.\r\nIsaac Taylor thinks that the strange Epworth episode so laid open\r\nWesley’s faculty of belief, that ever after a right of way for the\r\nsupernatural was opened through his mind; and, to the end of life,\r\nthere was nothing so marvellous that it could not freely pass where\r\n“Old Jeffrey” had passed before it. Taylor adds: “Wesley’s most\r\nprominent infirmity was his wonder-loving credulity; from the beginning\r\nto the end of his course this weakness ruled him.” Other opportunities\r\nwill occur of testing the truthfulness of Taylor’s statement; but\r\nhere it may be observed, that for young Wesley to have regarded the\r\nnoises at Epworth with indifference would have been irreligious and\r\nirrational. A metaphysician, vain of his philosophic powers, like\r\nIsaac Taylor, may “deal with occult folk, such as Jeffrey, huffingly\r\nand disrespectfully;” and may pretend to “catch in the Epworth\r\nghost a glimpse of an idiotic creature” belonging to some order of\r\ninvisible beings “not more intelligent than apes or pigs,” and which,\r\nby some “mischance, was thrown over its boundary, and obtained leave\r\nto disport itself among things palpable, and went to the extent of\r\nits tether in freaks of bootless mischief;” but, in broaching such a\r\ntheory, Isaac Taylor, wishing to be witty, makes himself ridiculous.\r\nJohn Wesley believed the noises to be supernatural; and Southey, as\r\ngreat an authority as Taylor, defends his belief; and argues that such\r\noccurrences have a tendency to explode the fine-spun theories of men\r\nwho deny another state of being, and to bring them to the conclusion\r\nthat there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in\r\ntheir philosophy. We have little doubt that the Epworth noises deepened\r\nand most powerfully increased Wesley’s convictions of the existence of\r\nan unseen world; and, in this way, exercised an important influence\r\non the whole of his future life. His notion,[18] that the disturbance\r\nwas occasioned by a messenger of Satan, sent to buffet his father for\r\na rash vow alleged to have been made fifteen years before, has been\r\nshown to be utterly unfounded;[19] but the impressions it produced, or\r\nrather strengthened, respecting invisible realities, were of the utmost\r\nconsequence in moulding his character, and in making him one of the\r\nmost earnest preachers of the Christian’s creed that ever lived.\r\n\r\nDuring Wesley’s residence at the Charterhouse, his brother Samuel was\r\nthe head usher of Westminster School; and in 1719, Wesley seems, for\r\na time, to have become his brother’s guest. Charles was now a pupil\r\nunder Samuel’s tuition; and the latter, writing to his father, says:\r\n“My brother Jack, I can faithfully assure you, gives you no manner of\r\ndiscouragement from breeding your third son a scholar. Jack is a brave\r\nboy, learning Hebrew as fast as he can.”[20]\r\n\r\nIn the following year, Wesley was elected to Christ Church, Oxford,\r\none of the noblest colleges in that illustrious seat of learning, and\r\nhere he continued until after his ordination in 1725. In reference\r\nto this period, he writes: “I still said my prayers, both in public\r\nand private; and read, with the Scriptures, several other books of\r\nreligion, especially comments on the New Testament. Yet I had not\r\nall this while so much as a notion of inward holiness; nay, went\r\non habitually and, for the most part, very contentedly, in some or\r\nother known sin; though with some intermission and short struggles,\r\nespecially before and after the holy communion, which I was obliged to\r\nreceive thrice a year.”[21]\r\n\r\nSuch was Wesley during the first five years he spent at Oxford. He\r\nmaintained the reputation for scholarship which he had acquired\r\nat school; but there was no alteration in his moral and religious\r\ncharacter. He said his prayers and read good books, as perhaps\r\nmost Oxford students did; but, like others, he lived in sin, even\r\nhabitually, except about thrice a year, when he was compelled to\r\nreceive the sacrament. No doubt, like all the Wesley family, he was a\r\ngay and sprightly companion, and full of wit and humour. He began to\r\namuse himself occasionally with writing verses, a specimen of which is\r\ngiven by Dr. Whitehead and is reproduced by Joseph Nightingale. The\r\nverses are six in number, and are merely the translation of a Latin\r\npoem respecting a young lady to whom he gives the name of Cloe. As\r\nJuno had a favourite peacock and Venus a favourite dove, so Cloe had a\r\nfavourite flea, whose bliss in being allowed to crawl over the young\r\nlady’s person the poet makes it his business to describe. Henry Moore\r\nis angry with Dr. Whitehead for having given the verses publicity; but\r\ncertainly without a cause. Had the piece been written by Wesley in\r\nadvanced life it might have deserved censure; but being written when he\r\nwas scarcely beyond his teens, it is only what a smart young fellow,\r\nfull of vivacity, might be expected to produce.\r\n\r\nWhen Wesley went to Oxford his health was far from being vigorous and\r\nrobust. He was frequently troubled with bleeding at the nose. In a\r\nletter to his mother, in 1723, he tells her that lately, while walking\r\nin the country, he had bled so violently that he was almost choked,\r\nnor could he at all abate the hæmorrhage till he stripped himself and\r\nleaped into the river.\r\n\r\nHe also had to struggle with financial difficulty, and was not\r\nunfrequently in debt. He sometimes had to borrow; and, more than\r\nonce, when requesting that his sisters would write to him, playfully\r\nremarks, that, though he was “so poor, he would be able to spare the\r\npostage for a letter now and then.” His friends were kind to him, and\r\nhis tutors were considerate. Soon after his entrance, his tutor, Mr.\r\nWigan, retired to one of his country livings, and was succeeded by Mr.\r\nSherman, who kindly told him that he would make his fees as low as\r\npossible.[22] Of course he had the £40 per annum, which belonged to\r\nhim as a Charterhouse scholar; but this, with the utmost economy, was\r\nhardly sufficient to meet all the expenses of a young Oxford student.\r\nThese financial embarrassments are often referred to in the subsequent\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nThe following is from an unpublished letter, written by his mother.\r\n\r\n    “WROOTE, _August 19, 1724_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR JACK,—I am uneasy because I have not heard from you. I\r\n    think you don’t do well to stand upon points, and to write only\r\n    letter for letter. Let me hear from you often, and inform me of\r\n    the state of your health, and whether you have any reasonable\r\n    hopes of being out of debt. I am most concerned for the good,\r\n    generous man that lent you ten pounds, and am ashamed to beg a\r\n    month or two longer, since he has been so kind as to grant us\r\n    so much time already. We were amused with your uncle’s coming\r\n    from India; but I suppose these fancies are laid aside. I wish\r\n    there had been anything in it, for then perhaps it would have\r\n    been in my power to have provided for you. But if all things\r\n    fail, I hope God will not forsake us. We have still His good\r\n    providence to depend on, which has a thousand expedients to\r\n    relieve us beyond our view.\r\n\r\n    “Dear Jack, be not discouraged; do your duty; keep close\r\n    to your studies, and hope for better days. Perhaps,\r\n    notwithstanding all, we shall pick up a few crumbs for you\r\n    before the end of the year.\r\n\r\n    “Dear Jacky, I beseech Almighty God to bless thee!\r\n\r\n    “SUSANNAH WESLEY.”\r\n\r\nThe following also, from another unpublished letter by his mother,\r\nrefers to the same subject.\r\n\r\n    “WROOTE, _September 10, 1724_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR JACKY,—I am nothing glad that Mr.—— has paid himself out\r\n    of your exhibition; for though I cannot hope, I do not despair,\r\n    of my brother’s coming, or, at least, remembering me where he\r\n    is.\r\n\r\n    “The small-pox has been very mortal at Epworth most of this\r\n    summer. Our family have all had it except me, and I hope God\r\n    will preserve me from it.\r\n\r\n    “I heartily wish you were in orders, and could come and serve\r\n    as one of your father’s curates. Then I should see you often,\r\n    and could be more helpful to you than it is possible to be at\r\n    this distance.”\r\n\r\nWe subjoin an extract from another letter, written shortly after the\r\nabove, and for the first time published in the _Wesleyan Times_ of\r\nJanuary 29, 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      JOHN WESLEY TO HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\n    “OXON, _November 1, 1724_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR MOTHER,—We are most of us now very healthy at Oxford,\r\n    which may be in some measure owing to the frosty weather we\r\n    have had lately. Fruit is so very cheap that apples may be\r\n    had almost for fetching; and other things are both plentiful\r\n    and good. We have, indeed, something bad as well as good, for\r\n    a great many rogues are about the town, insomuch that it is\r\n    exceedingly unsafe to be out late at night. A gentleman of my\r\n    acquaintance, standing at the door of a coffee-house about\r\n    seven in the evening, had no sooner turned about, but his cap\r\n    and wig were snatched off his head, and, though he followed\r\n    the thief a great distance, he was unable to recover them. I\r\n    am pretty safe from such gentlemen; for unless they carried me\r\n    away, carcass and all, they would have but a poor purchase.\r\n\r\n    “The chief piece of news with us is concerning the famous Jack\r\n    Sheppard’s escape from Newgate, which is indeed as surprising\r\n    as most stories I have heard.\r\n\r\n    “I suppose you have seen the famous Dr. Cheyne’s ‘Book of\r\n    Health and Long Life,’ which is, as he says he expected, very\r\n    much cried down by the physicians. He refers almost everything\r\n    to temperance and exercise, and supports most things with\r\n    physical reasons. He entirely condemns eating anything salt\r\n    or high-seasoned, as also pork, fish, and stall-fed cattle;\r\n    and recommends for drink two pints of water and one of wine in\r\n    twenty-four hours, with eight ounces of animal, and twelve of\r\n    vegetable food in the same time. The book is chiefly directed\r\n    to studious and sedentary persons.\r\n\r\n    “I should have writ before now had I not had an unlucky cut\r\n    across my thumb, which almost jointed it, but is now nearly\r\n    cured. I should be exceedingly glad to keep a correspondence\r\n    with my sister Emily if she were willing, for I believe I have\r\n    not heard from her since I have been at Oxford. I have writ\r\n    once or twice to my sister Sukey too, but have not had an\r\n    answer either from her or my sister Hetty, from whom I have\r\n    more than once desired the Poem of the Dog. I should be glad to\r\n    hear how things go on at Wroote, which I now remember with more\r\n    pleasure than Epworth; so true it is, at least in me, that the\r\n    persons, not the place, make home so pleasant.\r\n\r\n    “The scantiness of my paper obliges me to conclude with begging\r\n    yours and my father’s blessing on\r\n\r\n                                          “Your dutiful son,\r\n    “For Mrs. Wesley, at Wroote,                      “JOHN WESLEY.”\r\n     “To be left at the Post-office, in Bawtry, Nottinghamshire.”\r\n\r\nDr. Cheyne, mentioned in the preceding letter, was educated at\r\nEdinburgh, where his habits were temperate and sedentary; but,\r\nproceeding to London, he associated with a number of young gentry,\r\nto retain whose friendship it was necessary to indulge to the utmost\r\nin table luxuries. The result was, Cheyne became nervous, scorbutic,\r\nshort-breathed, lethargic and listless; and was so enormously fat\r\nas to be nearly thirty-three stones in weight. His life became an\r\nintolerable burden, and, to cure himself, he adopted a milk and\r\nvegetable diet, by means of which he recovered his strength, activity,\r\nand cheerfulness. He became the author of several interesting works,\r\none of which was the book just noticed. Wesley, to a great extent,\r\nadopted Cheyne’s prescription, and forty-six years after he read his\r\nbook at Oxford, wrote: “How marvellous are the ways of God! How has\r\nHe kept me even from a child! From ten to thirteen or fourteen, I had\r\nlittle but bread to eat, and not great plenty of even that. I believe\r\nthis was so far from hurting me, that it laid the foundation of lasting\r\nhealth. When I grew up, in consequence of reading Dr. Cheyne, I chose\r\nto eat sparingly, and to drink water. This was another great means\r\nof continuing my health, till I was about seven-and-twenty. I then\r\nbegan spitting of blood, which continued several years. A warm climate\r\n[Georgia] cured this. I was afterwards brought to the brink of death by\r\na fever; but it left me healthier than before. Eleven years after, I\r\nwas in the third stage of a consumption; in three months it pleased God\r\nto remove this also. Since that I have known neither pain nor sickness,\r\nand am now healthier than I was forty years ago.”[23] Cheyne became\r\none of Wesley’s favourites, and no wonder. After reading his “Natural\r\nMethod of Curing Diseases,” he designates it one of the most ingenious\r\nbooks he had ever seen; but adds, “What epicure will ever regard it?\r\nfor the man talks against good eating and drinking!”[24] Cheyne died\r\nin 1745, calmly giving up his soul to God, says Wesley, without any\r\nstruggle, either of body or mind.\r\n\r\nExcept the statement, that his _carcass_ was the only property he had,\r\nWesley makes not the least allusion, in the foregoing letter, to his\r\npecuniary embarrassments. Naturally enough, his mother was more anxious\r\nthan himself. Hence the following letter, hitherto unpublished, written\r\nwithin a month afterwards.\r\n\r\n    “WROOTE, _November 24, 1724_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR JACKY,—I have now three of your letters before me\r\n    unanswered. I take it very kindly that you write so often. I\r\n    am afraid of being chargeable, or I should miss few posts, it\r\n    being exceeding pleasant to me, in this solitude, to read your\r\n    letters, which, however, would be pleasing anywhere.\r\n\r\n    “Your disappointment, in not seeing us at Oxon, was not of such\r\n    consequence as mine in not meeting my brother in London; not\r\n    but your wonderful curiosities might excite a person of greater\r\n    faith than mine to travel to your museum to visit them. It is\r\n    almost a pity that somebody does not cut the wezand of that\r\n    keeper to cure his lying so enormously.\r\n\r\n    “I wish you would save all the money you can conveniently\r\n    spare, not to spend on a visit, but for a wiser and better\r\n    purpose,—to pay debts, and make yourself easy. I am not without\r\n    hope of meeting you next summer, if it please God to prolong\r\n    my mortal life. If you then be willing, and have time allowed\r\n    you to accompany me to Wroote, I will bear your charges, as God\r\n    shall enable me.\r\n\r\n    “I hope, at your leisure, you will oblige me with some more\r\n    verses on any, but rather on a religious subject.\r\n\r\n    “Dear Jack, I beseech Almighty God to bless you.\r\n\r\n    “SUSANNAH WESLEY.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Wesley’s brother, referred to in the foregoing letter, was in the\r\nservice of the East India Company; and, the public prints having stated\r\nthat he was returning to England in one of the company’s ships, Mrs.\r\nWesley proceeded to London to await his arrival, and to welcome him.\r\nThe information, however, was untrue, and both she and her son John\r\nwere doomed to a disappointment. Samuel, at the time, had a broken leg,\r\nand had invited John to meet his mother at Westminster. John jocosely\r\ncongratulates Samuel, that, like the Dutch seaman who broke his leg by\r\na fall from the mainmast of his ship, he might thank God that he had\r\nnot broken his neck also; and then he adds that his mother’s letter\r\nhad made him weep for joy, for the two things he most wished for of\r\nalmost anything in the world, were again to see his mother, and to see\r\nWestminster.[25]\r\n\r\nWesley was still in debt, a fact which gave his mother great anxiety.\r\nHis father also, as usual, was embarrassed, and yet, though offended\r\nat his son’s want of thrift, did his utmost to afford him help. The\r\nfollowing are painfully interesting letters, and one of them is now for\r\nthe first time published—\r\n\r\n    “_January 5, 1725._\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SON,—Your brother will receive £5 for you next Saturday,\r\n    if Mr. S—— is paid the £10 he lent you; if not, I must go to\r\n    H——, but I promise you I shan’t forget that you are my son, if\r\n    you do not that I am\r\n\r\n    “Your loving father,\r\n\r\n    “SAMUEL WESLEY.”\r\n\r\n    “WROOTE, _January 26, 1725_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SON,—I am so well pleased with your decent behaviour,\r\n    or, at least, with your letters, that I hope I shall have no\r\n    occasion to remember any more some things that are past; and\r\n    since you have now for some time bit upon the bridle, I will\r\n    take care hereafter to put a little honey upon it, as oft as\r\n    I am able; but then it shall be of my own mere motion, as the\r\n    last £5 was, for I will bear no rivals in my kingdom.\r\n\r\n    “Your affectionate father,\r\n\r\n    “SAMUEL WESLEY.”[26]\r\n\r\nSome will blame the writer for publishing such letters, on the ground\r\nthat they cast shadows on young Wesley’s character; but it ought to be\r\nborne in mind that the work of a biographer is not to hide facts, but\r\nto publish them. Why such an unwillingness to look at the specks as\r\nwell as sunshine in John Wesley’s history? Is it necessary, in order\r\nto establish the high position which has been assigned to Wesley, that\r\nthe reader should be made to think that from first to last he was _sui\r\ngeneris_, and altogether free from the infirmities, faults, and sins\r\nof ordinary men? If it were, we would rather lower the position than\r\npervert the facts; but we maintain, that no such necessity exists.\r\nWhen we say, that from the age of eleven to the age of twenty-two,\r\nWesley made no pretensions to be religious, and, except on rare\r\noccasions, habitually lived in the practice of known sin, we only say\r\nwhat is equally true of many of the greatest, wisest, and most godly\r\nmen that have ever lived. The fact is humiliating, and ought to be\r\ndeplored; but why hide it in one case more than in another? Wesley soon\r\nbecame one of the holiest and most useful men living; but, except the\r\nfirst ten years of his childhood, he was up to the age of twenty-two,\r\nby his own confession, an habitual, if not profane and flagrant sinner;\r\nand to his sin, he added the inconvenient and harassing infirmity of\r\nhis honest but imprudent father, and thoughtlessly contracted debts\r\ngreater than he had means to pay. His letters are without religious\r\nsentiments, and his life was without a religious aim. We yield to no\r\nman living in our high veneration of Wesley’s character; but, at the\r\nsame time, we cannot hide it from ourselves and others, that, being\r\nhuman, he was frail, and, like all his fellows, had need to repent as\r\nin dust and ashes, and to seek, through Christ, the forgiveness of his\r\nsins and a change of heart.\r\n\r\nBut leaving this, we turn to another important matter. There is no\r\nevidence to show, that, when Wesley went to Oxford, he intended or\r\nwished to become a minister of the Established Church; it might be so,\r\nbut it might be otherwise. It is true that, by obtaining ordination, he\r\nwould become entitled to one of the Church livings at the disposal of\r\nthe Charterhouse governors; but Wesley was far too noble and too high\r\nprincipled to seek admission into so sacred an office as the Christian\r\nministry merely to secure for himself a crust of bread. He might intend\r\nto devote himself, like his brother Samuel, to tutorship; or he might\r\ncontemplate some other mode of maintenance. Certain it is, that it was\r\nnot until about the beginning of 1725, when he had been more than four\r\nyears at college, that he expressed a wish to become a minister of\r\nChrist. The matter was properly submitted to his parents, and both gave\r\nhim the best advice they could.\r\n\r\nHis father told him that his principal motive for entering the ministry\r\nmust be, not, “as Eli’s sons, to eat a piece of bread,” but the glory\r\nof God, and the good of men; and that, as a qualification for its\r\nsacred functions, he ought to have a thorough knowledge of the Holy\r\nScriptures in their original languages. He was, however, not in haste\r\nfor his going into orders, and would give him further advice at some\r\nfuture time.\r\n\r\nOn February 23, 1725, his mother wrote to him as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “DEAR JACKY,—The alteration of your temper has occasioned me\r\n    much speculation. I, who am apt to be sanguine, hope it may\r\n    proceed from the operations of God’s Holy Spirit, that by\r\n    taking away your relish of sensual enjoyments, He may prepare\r\n    and dispose your mind for a more serious and close application\r\n    to things of a more sublime and spiritual nature. If it be so,\r\n    happy are you if you cherish those dispositions, and now, in\r\n    good earnest, resolve to make religion the business of your\r\n    life; for, after all, that is the one thing that strictly\r\n    speaking is necessary, and all things else are comparatively\r\n    little to the purposes of life. I heartily wish you would now\r\n    enter upon a serious examination of yourself, that you may\r\n    know whether you have a reasonable hope of salvation; that is,\r\n    whether you are in a state of faith and repentance or not,\r\n    which you know are the conditions of the gospel covenant on\r\n    our part. If you are, the satisfaction of knowing it would\r\n    abundantly reward your pains; if not, you will find a more\r\n    reasonable occasion for tears than can be met with in a tragedy.\r\n\r\n    “Now I mention this, it calls to mind your letter to your\r\n    father about taking orders. I was much pleased with it, and\r\n    liked the proposal well; but it is an unhappiness almost\r\n    peculiar to our family, that your father and I seldom think\r\n    alike. I approve the disposition of your mind, and think the\r\n    sooner you are a deacon the better; because it may be an\r\n    inducement to greater application in the study of practical\r\n    divinity, which I humbly conceive is the best study for\r\n    candidates for orders. Mr. Wesley differs from me, and would\r\n    engage you, I believe, in critical learning, which, though\r\n    accidentally of use, is in nowise preferable to the other.\r\n    I earnestly pray God to avert that great evil from you of\r\n    engaging in trifling studies to the neglect of such as are\r\n    absolutely necessary. I dare advise nothing: God Almighty\r\n    direct and bless you! I have much to say, but cannot write you\r\n    more at present. I long to see you. We hear nothing of H——\r\n    which gives us some uneasiness. We have all writ, but can get\r\n    no answer. I wish all be well—Adieu!\r\n\r\n    “SUSANNAH WESLEY.”[27]\r\n\r\nThree weeks after this, his father wrote to him, saying that he was now\r\ninclined to his entering orders without delay, and exhorting him to\r\nprayer and study in reference to such a step, promising that he would\r\nstruggle hard to obtain the money for the needful expenses.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, his sister Emilia wrote him a long letter, from which the\r\nfollowing extracts are taken:—\r\n\r\n    “WROOTE, _April 7, 1725_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR BROTHER,—Whether you will be engaged before thirty, or\r\n    not, I cannot determine; but, if my advice be worth listening\r\n    to, never engage your affections before your worldly affairs\r\n    are in such a posture that you may marry soon. The contrary\r\n    practice has proved very pernicious in our family. I know you\r\n    are a young man encompassed with difficulties, and have passed\r\n    through many hardships already, and probably must through many\r\n    more before you are easy in the world; but, believe me, if ever\r\n    you come to suffer the torment of a hopeless love, all other\r\n    afflictions will seem small in comparison of this.\r\n\r\n    “I know not when we have had so good a year, both at Wroote and\r\n    at Epworth, as this year; but instead of saving anything to\r\n    clothe my sister or myself, we are just where we were. A noble\r\n    crop has almost all gone, beside Epworth living, to pay some\r\n    part of those infinite debts my father has run into, which are\r\n    so many, that were he to save £50 a year, he would not be clear\r\n    in the world this seven years. One thing I warn you of: let not\r\n    my giving you this account be any hindrance to your affairs. If\r\n    you want assistance in any case, my father is as able to give\r\n    it now as any time these last ten years; nor shall we be ever\r\n    the poorer for it.\r\n\r\n    “I have quite tired you now; pray be faithful to me. Let me\r\n    have one relation that I can trust. Never give a hint to any\r\n    one of aught I write to you; and continue to love your unhappy\r\n    but affectionate sister,\r\n\r\n    “EMILIA WESLEY.”[28]\r\n\r\nWesley now began to apply himself with diligence to the study of\r\ndivinity. He writes: “When I was about twenty-two, my father pressed\r\nme to enter into holy orders. At the same time the providence of God\r\ndirecting me to Kempis’s ‘Christian’s Pattern,’ I began to see that\r\ntrue religion was seated in the heart, and that God’s law extended to\r\nall our thoughts as well as words and actions. I was, however, angry at\r\nKempis for being too strict; though I read him only in Dean Stanhope’s\r\ntranslation. Yet I had frequently much sensible comfort in reading\r\nhim, such as I was an utter stranger to before. Meeting likewise with\r\na religious friend, which I never had till now, I began to alter\r\nthe whole form of my conversation, and to set in earnest upon a new\r\nlife. I set apart an hour or two a day for religious retirement. I\r\ncommunicated every week. I watched against all sin, whether in word or\r\ndeed. I began to aim at, and to pray for, inward holiness. So that now,\r\ndoing so much and living so good a life, I doubted not that I was a\r\ngood Christian.”[29]\r\n\r\nWhat a confession! It was eleven years since Wesley left the parental\r\nroof; but he never had a _religious friend_ till now. No wonder he had\r\ngone astray.\r\n\r\nHaving written to his mother, stating some of the difficulties which\r\nhe had found in Kempis, she, on the 8th June, 1725, sent him a long\r\nletter, which, however adapted to an enlightened Christian, was\r\nuseless, if not misleading, to an anxious inquirer not yet converted.\r\nThe entire letter is before us, containing, besides a large amount of\r\nChristian casuistry, some family affairs of painful interest. These we\r\npass over, and merely give an extract in reference to Kempis:—\r\n\r\n    “I have Kempis by me; but have not read him lately. I cannot\r\n    recollect the passages you mention; but, believing you do him\r\n    justice, I do positively aver that he is extremely in the wrong\r\n    in that impious, I was about to say blasphemous, suggestion,\r\n    that God, by an irreversible decree, has determined any man to\r\n    be miserable even in this world. His intentions, as Himself,\r\n    are holy, just, and good; and all the miseries incident to men\r\n    here or hereafter proceed from themselves. I take Kempis to\r\n    have been an honest weak man, that had more zeal than knowledge.\r\n\r\n    “Your brother has brought us a heavy reckoning for you and\r\n    Charles. God be merciful to us all! Dear Jack, I earnestly\r\n    beseech Almighty God to bless you. Adieu!\r\n\r\n    “SUSANNAH WESLEY.”\r\n\r\nTen days after the date of his mother’s letter, he wrote to her again,\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n    “_June 18, 1725._\r\n\r\n    “You have so well satisfied me as to the tenets of Thomas à\r\n    Kempis, that I have ventured to trouble you again on a more\r\n    dubious subject. Dr. Taylor, in his ‘Holy Living and Dying,’\r\n    says, ‘Whether God has forgiven us or no, we know not;\r\n    therefore, be sorrowful for ever having sinned.’ This seems to\r\n    contradict his own words in the next section, where he says\r\n    that ‘by the Lord’s supper all the members are united to one\r\n    another, and to Christ the Head. The Holy Ghost confers on us\r\n    the graces necessary for, and our souls receive the seed of, an\r\n    immortal life.’ Now surely these graces are of not so little\r\n    force as that we cannot perceive whether we have them or not.\r\n    If we dwell in Christ, and Christ in us (which He will not do\r\n    unless we are regenerate), certainly we must be sensible of it.\r\n    If we can never have any certainty of our being in a state of\r\n    salvation, good reason it is that every moment should be spent,\r\n    not in joy, but in fear and trembling; and then, undoubtedly,\r\n    in this life we are of all men the most miserable. God deliver\r\n    us from such a fearful expectation as this!”[30]\r\n\r\nWe thus find young Wesley carefully reading Thomas à Kempis and Jeremy\r\nTaylor, and groping after two of the great doctrines which afterwards\r\ndistinguished his ministry: God’s love to _all_, and the privilege\r\nof living in a state of conscious salvation. These and other topics\r\npuzzled him, and yet he seemed to have an almost instinctive knowledge\r\nof what is truth. We have seen his mother’s sentiments concerning\r\nKempis. His father, on the 14th of July following, observes that\r\nthough Kempis has gone to an extreme in teaching the doctrine of\r\nself-mortification, yet, considering the age in which he wrote, there\r\nwas no need to be surprised at this. And then he adds: “Making some\r\ngrains of allowance, he may be read to great advantage. Notwithstanding\r\nall his superstition and enthusiasm, it is almost impossible to peruse\r\nhim seriously, without admiring, and in some measure imitating, his\r\nheroic strains of humility and piety and devotion.”\r\n\r\nThe books of Kempis and Taylor seem to have been the first on practical\r\ndivinity that Wesley read, and, to the day of his death, were held\r\nin high esteem. Kempis’s “Pattern” was one of the first books that\r\nWesley published; and an extract from Taylor’s work forms a part of\r\nhis “Christian Library.” In his estimation, Taylor was a man of the\r\nsublimest piety, and one of the greatest geniuses on earth;[31] and\r\nKempis is always spoken of in terms of high respect. What were the\r\nresults of Wesley’s reading?\r\n\r\n1. To this incident we are indebted for Wesley’s long continued record\r\nof the events and exercises of his daily life. In the preface to his\r\nfirst journal, dated September 20, 1740, he states, that about fifteen\r\nyears ago (1725), in pursuance of an advice given by Bishop Taylor in\r\nhis “Rules for Holy Living and Dying,” he began to take a more exact\r\naccount than he had done before of the manner wherein he spent his\r\ntime, writing down how he had employed every hour. The practice thus\r\nbegun was uninterruptedly continued until his death, and issued in\r\ngiving to the world one of the most interesting works in the English\r\nlanguage; a work not only containing the best history of the great\r\nreformer, and of the rise and growth of the Methodist movement, but\r\nsparkling with the most racy remarks respecting men, books, places,\r\nscience, witches, ghosts, and almost everything with which the writer\r\ncame in contact.\r\n\r\n2. Another, and far more important result of reading Kempis and\r\nTaylor, was an entire change of life. He writes respecting Kempis’s\r\n“Pattern:” “When I met with it in 1726,[32] the nature and extent of\r\ninward religion, the religion of the heart, now appeared to me in a\r\nstronger light than ever it had done before. I saw that giving even all\r\nmy life to God (supposing it possible to do this, and go no further)\r\nwould profit me nothing, unless I gave my heart, yea, all my heart, to\r\nHim. I saw that simplicity of intention, and purity of affection, one\r\ndesign in all we speak and do, and one desire ruling all our tempers,\r\nare indeed the wings of the soul, without which she can never ascend to\r\nGod. I sought after this from that hour.”[33]\r\n\r\nAgain, in reference to Taylor’s “Holy Living and Dying,” he observes:\r\n“In reading several parts of this book, I was exceedingly affected;\r\nthat part in particular which relates to purity of intention. Instantly\r\nI resolved to dedicate all my life to God,—all my thoughts, and words,\r\nand actions,—being thoroughly convinced there was no medium; but that\r\nevery part of my life (not some only) must either be a sacrifice to\r\nGod, or myself, that is, in effect, the devil.”[34]\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have the turning-point in Wesley’s history. It was not\r\nuntil thirteen years after this, that he received the consciousness of\r\nbeing saved through faith in Christ; but from this time, his whole aim\r\nwas to serve God and his fellowmen, and to get safe to heaven. No man\r\ncould be more sincere, earnest, devout, diligent, and self-denying; and\r\nyet, during this lengthened period, he lived and laboured in a mist.\r\n\r\nHis father was £350 in debt; but was now resolved to do his utmost to\r\nobtain ordination for his son. He urged him to master St. Chrysostom\r\nand the articles; and sent his “Letter to a Curate,” in manuscript, to\r\nassist him in his preparations; and also wrote to the Bishop of Lincoln\r\nin his favour.[35] Meanwhile his mother tried to solve some of his\r\nscruples respecting the article on predestination;[36] and wrote him a\r\nlong letter, not hitherto published, from which we give the following\r\nextracts:—\r\n\r\n    “Wroote, _July 21, 1725_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR JACKEY,—Though I have a great deal of unpleasant\r\n    business, am infirm, and but slow of understanding, yet it is\r\n    a pleasure to me to correspond with you on religious subjects;\r\n    and, if it be of the least advantage to you, I shall greatly\r\n    rejoice. I know little or nothing of Dr. Taylor’s ‘Holy Living\r\n    and Dying,’ having not seen it for above twenty years; but\r\n    I think it is generally well esteemed. I cannot judge of\r\n    the rules you suppose impracticable; but I will tell you my\r\n    thoughts of humility as briefly as I can.”\r\n\r\nHere follow her remarks on humility. She continues:—\r\n\r\n    “He is certainly right, that there is but one true repentance,\r\n    for repentance is a state not a transient act; and this state\r\n    begins in a change of the whole mind from evil to good, and\r\n    contains, in some sense, all the parts of a holy life.[37]\r\n    Repentance, in Scripture, is said to signify the whole of\r\n    obedience, as faith often includes repentance, and all the\r\n    subsequent acts of religion: ‘Repent, and thy sins shall be\r\n    forgiven thee;’ ‘Believe, and thou shalt be saved.’ If, after\r\n    this change, we fall into the contrary state—a state of wilful\r\n    impenitence—which is nothing less than a total apostasy—the\r\n    Scripture is plain; ‘There remaineth no more sacrifice for\r\n    sin;’ no place is left for repentance; for, by this formal\r\n    renunciation of our most holy faith, we ‘crucify afresh the Son\r\n    of God, and put Him to an open shame.’ But this is not the case\r\n    of those who never were converted; or of such who, having been\r\n    converted, fall nevertheless sometimes into their old sins,\r\n    through the fault of their nature, or the stress of temptation.\r\n\r\n    “I don’t well understand what he means by saying, ‘Whether\r\n    God has forgiven us or no, we know not.’ If he intends such\r\n    a certainty of pardon as cannot possibly admit of the least\r\n    doubt or scruple, he is infallibly in the right; for such an\r\n    absolute certainty we can never have till we come to heaven.\r\n    But if he means no more than that reasonable persuasion of\r\n    the forgiveness of sins, which a true penitent feels when he\r\n    reflects on the evidences of his own sincerity, he is certainly\r\n    in the wrong, for such a firm persuasion is actually enjoyed by\r\n    man in this life.\r\n\r\n    “The virtues which we have by the grace of God acquired, are\r\n    not of so little force as he supposes; for we may surely\r\n    perceive when we have them in any good degree. But when our\r\n    love to God, and faith in the Lord Jesus are weak (for there\r\n    is a great inequality in our lives); when, though we strive\r\n    against our sins, we have not so far overcome but that we\r\n    sometimes relapse into them again,—in such a case we shall be\r\n    often doubtful of our state. But when, by the assistance of the\r\n    Holy Spirit, we have made a considerable progress in religion,\r\n    and when habits of virtue are confirmed; when we find little\r\n    disturbance from any exorbitant appetite, and can maintain\r\n    an even tenour of life,—we shall be easy, and free from all\r\n    torment, doubts, or fears of our future happiness; for perfect\r\n    love will cast out fears.\r\n\r\n    “I am entirely of your opinion, that whenever we worthily\r\n    communicate, with faith, humility, etc., our sins are forgiven,\r\n    and will never rise in judgment against us if we forsake them.\r\n    The Scripture is so clear and express in this case, that I\r\n    think none can question the pardon of his sins if he repent,\r\n    except such as do not believe it.\r\n\r\n    “But if you would be free from fears and doubts concerning your\r\n    future happiness, every morning and evening commit your soul\r\n    to Jesus Christ, in a full faith in His power and will to save\r\n    you. If you do this seriously and constantly, He will take\r\n    you under His conduct; He will guide you by His Holy Spirit\r\n    into the way of truth, and give you strength to walk in it.\r\n    He will dispose of the events of God’s general providence to\r\n    your spiritual advantage; and if, to keep you humble and more\r\n    sensible of your dependence on Him, He permit you to fall into\r\n    lesser sins, be not discouraged; for He will certainly give you\r\n    repentance, and safely guide you through all the temptations of\r\n    this world, and, at the last, receive you to Himself in glory.\r\n\r\n    “Your father has written lately to you about your business. I\r\n    heartily wish you success, for I am greatly troubled at your\r\n    unhappy circumstances. I can do nothing at present but pray for\r\n    you. Dear Jack, I beseech Almighty God to bless you.\r\n\r\n    “SUSANNAH WESLEY.”\r\n\r\nPart of Wesley’s reply to his mother’s letter is as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “_July 29, 1725._\r\n\r\n    “That we can never be so certain of the pardon of our sins as\r\n    to be assured they will never rise up against us, I firmly\r\n    believe. We know that they will infallibly do so if ever we\r\n    apostatize, and I am not satisfied what evidence there can be\r\n    of our final perseverance, till we have finished our course.\r\n    But I am persuaded we may know if we are now in a state of\r\n    salvation, since that is expressly promised in the Holy\r\n    Scriptures to our sincere endeavours, and we are, surely, able\r\n    to judge of our own sincerity.\r\n\r\n    “What shall I say of predestination? An everlasting purpose of\r\n    God to deliver some from damnation, does, I suppose, exclude\r\n    all from that deliverance who are not chosen. And if it was\r\n    inevitably decreed from eternity that such a determinate part\r\n    of mankind should be saved, and none beside them, a vast\r\n    majority of the world were only born to eternal death, without\r\n    so much as a possibility of avoiding it. How is this consistent\r\n    with either the Divine justice or mercy? Is it merciful to\r\n    ordain a creature to everlasting misery? Is it just to punish\r\n    man for crimes which he could not but commit? That God should\r\n    be the author of sin and injustice (which must, I think, be the\r\n    consequence of maintaining this opinion), is a contradiction\r\n    to the clearest ideas we have of the Divine nature and\r\n    perfections.”[38]\r\n\r\nIf the ideas of Wesley and his mother, on the way of attaining\r\nsalvation, had been as scriptural as his ideas on general redemption,\r\nboth would have been in a holier and happier frame of mind.\r\n\r\nWesley’s religion already made him the subject of contemptuous sneers.\r\nHence the following from his father:—\r\n\r\n    “WROOTE, _August 2, 1725_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SON,—If you be what you write I shall be happy. As to\r\n    the gentlemen candidates you mention, does anybody think the\r\n    devil is dead, or asleep, or that he has no agents left? Surely\r\n    virtue can bear being laughed at. The Captain and Master\r\n    endured something more for us before He entered into glory, and\r\n    unless we track His steps, in vain do we hope to share that\r\n    glory with Him.\r\n\r\n    “Nought else but blessing from your loving father,\r\n\r\n    “SAMUEL WESLEY.”\r\n\r\nWesley was still in doubt in reference to several matters which had\r\noccurred to him during his late religious reading; and to relieve his\r\ndoubts, his mother sent him some of the ablest letters she ever penned.\r\nThe subjoined is taken from a long epistle now before us, and only part\r\nof which has heretofore been published:—\r\n\r\n    “WROOTE, _August 18, 1725_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR JACKEY,—Divine faith is an assent to whatever God has\r\n    revealed to us, because He has revealed it. And this is that\r\n    virtue of faith which is one of the two conditions of our\r\n    salvation by Jesus Christ. But this matter is so fully and\r\n    accurately explained by Bishop Pearson (under ‘I Believe’) that\r\n    I shall say no more of it.\r\n\r\n    “I have often wondered that men should be so vain as to amuse\r\n    themselves with searching into the decrees of God, which no\r\n    human wit can fathom, and do not rather employ their time and\r\n    powers in working out their salvation. Such studies tend more\r\n    to confound than to inform the understanding, and young people\r\n    had better let them alone. But since I find you have some\r\n    scruples concerning our article, Of Predestination, I will tell\r\n    you my thoughts of the matter. If they satisfy not, you may\r\n    desire your father’s direction, who is surely better qualified\r\n    for a casuist than I.\r\n\r\n    “The doctrine of predestination, as maintained by the rigid\r\n    Calvinists, is very shocking, and ought to be abhorred, because\r\n    it directly charges the most high God with being the author of\r\n    sin. I think you reason well and justly against it; for it is\r\n    certainly inconsistent with the justice and goodness of God\r\n    to lay any man under either a physical or moral necessity of\r\n    committing sin, and then to punish him for doing it.\r\n\r\n    “I firmly believe that God, from eternity, has elected some to\r\n    eternal life; but then I humbly conceive that this election\r\n    is founded on His foreknowledge, according to Romans viii.\r\n    29, 30. Whom, in His eternal prescience, God saw would make\r\n    a right use of their powers, and accept of offered mercy,\r\n    He did predestinate and adopt for His children. And that\r\n    they may be conformed to the image of His only Son, He calls\r\n    them to Himself, through the preaching of the gospel, and,\r\n    internally, by His Holy Spirit; which call they obeying,\r\n    repenting of their sins and believing in the Lord Jesus, He\r\n    justifies them, absolves them from the guilt of all their sins,\r\n    and acknowledges them as just and righteous persons, through\r\n    the merits and mediation of Jesus Christ. And having thus\r\n    justified, He receives them to glory—to heaven.\r\n\r\n    “This is the sum of what I believe concerning predestination,\r\n    which I think is agreeable to the analogy of faith; since it\r\n    does in nowise derogate from the glory of God’s free grace,\r\n    nor impair the liberty of man. Nor can it with more reason\r\n    be supposed that the prescience of God is the cause that so\r\n    many finally perish, than that one knowing the sun will rise\r\n    to-morrow is the cause of its rising.”\r\n\r\nJohn Wesley substantially adopted his mother’s predestinarian views,\r\nas may be seen in his sermon on the text which she expounds in the\r\nforegoing letter; but his notions of that faith by which a sinner\r\nis justified were, at present, like those of his mother, vague and\r\ngeneral, and far from being clear.\r\n\r\nThe time for Wesley’s ordination was now approaching, and the money\r\nquestion again rose up like a spectre, and required attention. His\r\nfather writes:—\r\n\r\n    “BAWTRY, _September 1, 1725_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SON,—I came hither to-day because I cannot be at rest\r\n    till I make you easier. I could not possibly manufacture any\r\n    money for you here sooner than next Saturday. On Monday I\r\n    design to wait on Dr. Morley, and will try to prevail with\r\n    your brother to return you £8 with interest. I will assist you\r\n    in the charges for ordination, though I am myself just now\r\n    struggling for life. This £8 you may depend on the next week,\r\n    or the week after.\r\n\r\n    “Your affectionate father,\r\n    “SAMUEL WESLEY.”[39]\r\n\r\nDifficulties were overcome, and Wesley, having prepared himself with\r\nthe most conscientious care for the ministerial office, was ordained\r\ndeacon on Sunday, September 19th, 1725.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_WESLEY’S ORDINATION, ETC._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1725 Age 22]\r\n\r\nWhat was the state of things about the time of Wesley’s ordination?\r\nWesley entered the Charterhouse in the year Queen Anne died. George\r\nI., Elector of Hanover, took her place. Endless intrigues in favour of\r\nthe Pretender sprung up; and Bolingbroke fled to him on the Continent,\r\nand became his Secretary of State. Ormond gave magnificent fêtes at\r\nRichmond, and gathered around him the most fiery of the Jacobites,\r\nand the most intolerant of the high church party, till he also found\r\nit expedient to follow Bolingbroke’s example, and secretly escape to\r\nFrance. The clergy, in many instances, preached sermons and published\r\npamphlets in which the temper, orthodoxy, and religion of King George\r\nwere not painted in the brightest colours, and in which they hesitated\r\nnot to say that England would soon be eaten up by Hanoverian rats and\r\nother foreign vermin. Rumours of invasion and of insurrection became\r\ngeneral, and, about a year after George’s coronation, the Chevalier\r\nlanded in Scotland, to take possession of what he called his kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe history of this adventure is too well known to be repeated here.\r\nSuffice it to observe, that Parliament set a price on the Pretender’s\r\nhead, by offering a reward of £100,000 for his arrest. In Scotland,\r\nKing George’s troops were put to live in free quarters, in the houses\r\nand upon the estates of Jacobites. In England, gaols were crowded with\r\nnonjuring Protestants, high church divines, and Popish squires, monks,\r\nand priests; while the Chevalier, like his poltroon father, fled from\r\ndanger, and left thousands of his hot-headed followers to pay a fearful\r\npenalty for their rash adherence to him. Plotters, however, still\r\nplotted; among the chief of whom was Bishop Atterbury, the friend and\r\npatron of Wesley’s brother Samuel. The prelate was arrested, was tried\r\nin the House of Lords, was deprived of his bishopric, was banished from\r\nhis country, entered the service of the Pretender, and became his\r\nconfidential agent.\r\n\r\nThese were times of terrible upheaving, and, surrounded by such\r\ncommotions, young Wesley quietly pursued his scholastic studies, first\r\nin the Charterhouse, London, and afterwards in Christ Church College,\r\nOxford. In the year in which Wesley went to Oxford, the South Sea\r\nbubble burst, and, by its gambling, knavish madness, the nation was\r\ninvolved in the most disgraceful kind of bankruptcy. About the same\r\nperiod, Parliament were discussing bills to authorize bishops and\r\ncounty magistrates to summon Dissenting ministers to quarter sessions\r\nto subscribe to a declaration of the Christian faith; and, upon their\r\nrefusal, to deprive them of the benefit of the Act of Toleration;\r\nwhile, oddly enough, at the same time, Walpole, the prime minister,\r\nwas endeavouring to satisfy the squeamish demand to omit from the\r\n“affirmation” of the Quakers the words,—“In the presence of Almighty\r\nGod”—a demand which Atterbury resisted to the uttermost, insisting that\r\nsuch an indulgence was not due to “a set of people who were hardly\r\nChristians.”\r\n\r\nWesley was ordained a deacon by Bishop Potter, the son of a Yorkshire\r\nlinen-draper; a man of great talent, and immense learning,—somewhat\r\nhaughty and morose, and yet highly esteemed by a great portion of his\r\ncontemporaries,—a high churchman, who maintained that episcopacy was\r\nof Divine institution, and yet one who cherished a friendly feeling\r\ntowards the first Methodists, saying concerning them, “These gentlemen\r\nare irregular; but they have done good; and I pray God to bless them.”\r\nTo the day of his death, Wesley held Potter in high esteem, calling\r\nhim “a great and good man”; and, in a sermon written as late as the\r\nyear 1787, mentioning an advice which the bishop had given him half\r\na century before, and for which he had often thanked Almighty God,\r\nnamely, “That if he wished to be extensively useful, he must not spend\r\nhis time in contending for or against things of a disputable nature,\r\nbut in testifying against notorious vice, and in promoting real,\r\nessential holiness.”[40]\r\n\r\nIt is a somewhat remarkable circumstance that, just about the time\r\nof Wesley’s ordination, Voltaire was expelled from France, and fled\r\nto England, where he published his celebrated “Henriade,” a work\r\nwhich was patronized by George I., and which yielded a profit that\r\nlaid the foundation of the infidels future fortune. During a long\r\nlife, he and Wesley were contemporaneous, and, perhaps, of all\r\nthe men then living, none exercised so great an influence as the\r\nrestless philosopher and the unwearied minister of Christ. No men,\r\nhowever, could be more dissimilar. Wesley, in person, was beautiful;\r\nVoltaire was of a physiognomy so strange, and lighted up with fire so\r\nhalf-hellish and half-heavenly, that it was hard to say whether it\r\nwas the face of a satyr or a man. Wesley’s heart was filled with a\r\nworld-wide benevolence; Voltaire, though of gigantic mind, scarcely had\r\na heart at all,—an incarnation of avaricious meanness, and a victim to\r\npetty passions. Wesley was the friend of all and the enemy of none;\r\nVoltaire was too selfish to love, and when forced to pay the scanty\r\nand ill-tempered homage which he sometimes rendered, it was always\r\noffered at the shrine of rank and wealth. Wesley had myriads who loved\r\nhim; Voltaire had numerous admirers, but probably not a friend. Both\r\nwere men of ceaseless labour, and almost unequalled authors; but while\r\nthe one filled the land with blessings, the other, by his sneering and\r\nmendacious attacks against revealed religion, inflicted a greater curse\r\nthan has been inflicted by the writings of any other author either\r\nbefore or since. The evangelist is now esteemed by all whose good\r\nopinions are worth having; the philosopher is only remembered to be\r\nbranded with well-merited reproach and shame.\r\n\r\nWesley’s first sermon was preached at South Leigh, a small village\r\nthree miles from Witney. Forty-six years afterwards he preached in the\r\nsame place, when there was one man present who had been a member of his\r\nfirst congregation.[41]\r\n\r\nAnother of his early sermons was delivered at Epworth, January 11,\r\n1726, at the funeral of John Griffith, a hopeful young man, son of\r\none of the Epworth parishioners. The text was 2 Samuel xii. 23, and\r\nthe subject of the brief sermon was the folly of indulging grief,\r\nexcept on account of sin. Funeral sermons, in the common acceptation\r\nof the word, the young preacher denounces, for they had been so often\r\nprostituted to a mere flattery of the dead that now they were no longer\r\ncapable of serving good purposes. “It is of no service to the dead,”\r\nsays he, “to celebrate his actions, since he has the applause of God\r\nand His holy angels, and his own conscience. And it is of little use\r\nto the living, since he who desires a pattern may find enough proposed\r\nas such in the sacred writings.” For such reasons, Wesley, already\r\nlaconic, reduces all that he has to say of John Griffith into a single\r\nsentence. “To his parents he was an affectionate, dutiful son; to his\r\nacquaintance an ingenuous, cheerful, good-natured companion; and to me\r\na well-tried, sincere friend.”[42]\r\n\r\nIn a little more than two months after the delivery of this sermon,\r\nWesley was elected fellow of Lincoln College.[43] The election took\r\nplace March 17th, 1726. In this affair, his brother Samuel rendered\r\nhim considerable assistance; his mother, with a full heart, thanked\r\nAlmighty God for his “good success;”[44] and his father wrote him as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n    “DEAR MR. FELLOW ELECT OF LINCOLN,—I have done more than I\r\n    could for you. On your waiting on Dr. Morley[45] with this,\r\n    he will pay you £12. You are inexpressibly obliged to that\r\n    generous man. The last £12 pinched me so hard, that I am forced\r\n    to beg time of your brother Sam till after harvest, to pay him\r\n    the £10 that you say he lent you. Nor shall I have as much as\r\n    that, perhaps not £5, to keep my family till after harvest; and\r\n    I do not expect that I shall be able to do anything for Charles\r\n    when he goes to the university. What will be my own fate God\r\n    only knows. _Sed passi graviora._ Wherever I am, my Jack is\r\n    fellow of Lincoln. I wrote to Dr. King, desiring leave for you\r\n    to come one, two, or three months into the country, where you\r\n    shall be gladly welcome. Keep your best friend fast; and, next\r\n    to him, Dr. Morley; and have a care of your other friends,\r\n    especially the younger. All at present from your loving father,\r\n\r\n    “SAMUEL WESLEY.”[46]\r\n\r\nWriting to his brother Samuel, Wesley says:—\r\n\r\n    “LINCOLN COLLEGE, OXON, _April 4, 1726_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR BROTHER,—My father very unexpectedly, a week ago, sent me\r\n    a bill on Dr. Morley for £12, which he had paid to the rector’s\r\n    use at Gainsborough; so that now all my debts are paid, and\r\n    the expenses of my treat defrayed; and I have still above £10\r\n    remaining. If I could have leave to stay in the country till\r\n    my college allowance commences, this money would abundantly\r\n    suffice me till then.\r\n\r\n    “I never knew a college besides ours, whereof the members\r\n    were so perfectly well satisfied with one another, and so\r\n    inoffensive to the other part of the university. All the\r\n    fellows I have yet seen are both well-natured and well-bred;\r\n    men admirably disposed as well to preserve peace and good\r\n    neighbourhood among themselves, as to preserve it wherever else\r\n    they have any acquaintance.\r\n\r\n    “I am, etc.,\r\n    “JOHN WESLEY.”[47]\r\n\r\nThe following, which was also addressed to his brother Samuel, is\r\namusing. Wesley was so poor that he could ill afford to employ a barber\r\nto cut and dress his hair, even when his mother wished it, and when he\r\nhimself thought it might improve his personal appearance.\r\n\r\n    “My mother’s reason for my cutting off my hair is because she\r\n    fancies it prejudices my health. As to my looks, it would\r\n    doubtless mend my complexion to have it off, by letting me get\r\n    a little more colour, and perhaps it might contribute to my\r\n    making a more genteel appearance. But these, till ill health\r\n    is added to them, I cannot persuade myself to be sufficient\r\n    grounds for losing two or three pounds a year. I am ill enough\r\n    able to spare them.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Sherman says there are garrets, somewhere in Peckwater, to\r\n    be let for fifty shillings a year; that there are some honest\r\n    fellows in college, who would be willing to chum in one of\r\n    them; and that, could my brother but find one of these garrets,\r\n    and get acquainted with one of these honest fellows, he might\r\n    possibly prevail upon him to join in taking it; and then if he\r\n    could but prevail upon some one else to give him £7 a year for\r\n    his own room, he would gain almost £6 a year clear, if his rent\r\n    were well paid. He appealed to me whether the proposal was not\r\n    exceedingly reasonable? But as I could not give him such an\r\n    answer as he desired, I did not choose to give him any at all.\r\n\r\n    “Leisure and I have taken leave of one another. I propose to be\r\n    busy as long as I live, if my health is so long indulged me. In\r\n    health and sickness I hope I shall ever continue with the same\r\n    sincerity,\r\n\r\n    “Your loving brother,\r\n    “JOHN WESLEY.”[48]\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley had just removed from Westminster School to the\r\nuniversity, being elected to the same college as that in which his\r\nbrother had spent the last six years. John obtained leave of absence\r\nfrom Lincoln College, and spent the summer at Epworth and Wroote with\r\nhis venerated parents. Here he usually read prayers and preached twice\r\nevery sabbath; pursued his studies with the greatest diligence; and\r\nconversed with his father and mother on many of the chief topics of\r\npractical religion, noting in his diary such of their rules and maxims\r\nas appeared to him important.[49] While here, he wrote his paraphrase\r\non the 104th Psalm,—a production of genius fully showing that if Wesley\r\nhad cultivated his poetic talents he might easily have attained to\r\nno inferior position among the bards of Britain. The following is an\r\nextract:—\r\n\r\n    “Thou, brooding o’er the realms of night,\r\n    The’ unbottomed infinite abyss,\r\n    Bad’st the deep her rage surcease,\r\n      And saidst, _Let there be light!_\r\n    Ethereal light Thy call obeyed,\r\n    Glad she left her native shade,\r\n    Darkness turned his murmuring head,\r\n    Resigned the reins, and trembling fled.”[50]\r\n\r\n“Make poetry your diversion,”[51] said Wesley’s mother, “but not your\r\nbusiness;” and because he acted on this advice his poetical pieces are\r\ncomparatively few. It is well known, however, that some of the noblest\r\nhymns in the Wesleyan hymn-book were written by John Wesley’s pen. What\r\ncan exceed, in poetic grandeur, the three hymns beginning with the\r\nline:—\r\n\r\n    “Father of all, whose powerful voice,” etc.\r\n\r\nOr the two hymns commencing with:—\r\n\r\n    “O God, Thou bottomless abyss,” etc.\r\n\r\nOr the hymn beginning:—\r\n\r\n    “O God, of good the’ unfathomed sea,” etc.\r\n\r\nOr again:—\r\n\r\n    “O God the Son, in whom combine,” etc.\r\n\r\nOr again:—\r\n\r\n      “Jesus, whose glory’s streaming rays,” etc.\r\n    “Now I have found the ground wherein,” etc.\r\n      “Jesus, Thy blood and righteousness,” etc.\r\n    “Thee will I love, my strength, my tower,” etc.\r\n\r\nOr again, the two hymns commencing with:—\r\n\r\n    “Commit thou all thy griefs,” etc.\r\n\r\nOr again:—\r\n\r\n    “Thou hidden love of God, whose height,” etc.\r\n\r\nLet it be granted that these and others were translations; but still\r\nit must be ceded that the words, if not the thoughts, are Wesley’s;\r\nand that never, in uninspired language, is God adored and praised in\r\nloftier or more sacred strains than in the singing of the hymns above\r\nmentioned. Apart from his numerous hymn-books, Wesley, at different\r\ntimes, published five volumes of poetry, and, to the day of his death,\r\nread it with the richest relish.\r\n\r\nWesley returned to Oxford on the 21st of September, 1726, and resumed\r\nhis studies. His literary character was now established at the\r\nuniversity. All parties acknowledged him to be a man of talents and\r\nof learning; while his skill in logic was known to be remarkable. The\r\nresult was, though he was only in the twenty-third year of his age, and\r\nhad not yet taken a master’s degree, he was, within two months after\r\nhis return from Epworth, on November 7th, elected Greek lecturer and\r\nmoderator of the classes.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the year 1727, Wesley, in a letter,[52] tells\r\nhis mother that he had drawn up for himself a scheme of studies, and\r\nhad “perfectly come over to her opinion, that there are many truths it\r\nis not worth while to know. If we had a dozen centuries of life allowed\r\nus, we might, perhaps, be pardoned for spending a little time upon such\r\ncurious trifles; but, with the small pittance of life we have, it would\r\nbe great ill husbandry to spend a considerable part of it in what makes\r\nneither a quick nor a sure return.” Wesley adds, that, about the time\r\nof his ordination, he had, while watching with a college friend a young\r\nlady’s funeral, attempted to make his friend a Christian. From that\r\ntime this youth was exceedingly serious; and a fortnight ago had died\r\nof consumption. Wesley was with him three days before his decease, and\r\non the Sunday following, in accordance with his friend’s desire while\r\nliving, he did him the last good office that he could by preaching his\r\nfuneral sermon. Here was _Wesley’s first convert_.\r\n\r\nAnother friend must be introduced, not so serious as the sight of a\r\nfuneral has a tendency to make us, but a sprightly young collegian,\r\nmore vivacious than religious, who, in 1729, became one of the first\r\nfour Methodists that met together to read the Greek Testament,[53] and\r\nwhose portrait occupies a place in the large and beautiful engraving\r\nof “The Rev. John Wesley and his Friends at Oxford.” The following\r\nletter is valuable only as it tends to show that Wesley, and some of\r\nhis college friends, were not yet so intensely religious as they became\r\nsoon after.\r\n\r\n    “STANTON, _February 2, 1727_.\r\n\r\n    “With familiarity I write, Dear Jack.—On Friday night last I\r\n    received your kind accusation. You generously passed by, or\r\n    pardoned, all insipid or impertinent expressions; but I am\r\n    condemned for brevity before I could put forth my defence.\r\n    My plea is, I writ yours, as likewise one to Harry Yardley,\r\n    of equal importance, in the space of three hours. My letter\r\n    was really longer than yours by Scripture proof; for you writ\r\n    scarce much out of your abundance of thoughts; whereas I writ\r\n    all that I thought of, and thought of all I could write. I\r\n    have not the presumption to compare my expressions or style\r\n    with yours, because there I am excelled beyond all degrees of\r\n    comparison.\r\n\r\n    ‘For when you write, smooth elocution flows;\r\n    But when Bob scrawls, rough ignorance he shows.’\r\n\r\n    I am just going down to a dinner of calves’ head and bacon,\r\n    with some of the best green cabbages in the town. I wish I\r\n    could send you a plate of our entertainment while it is hot. We\r\n    have just tapped a barrel of admirable cider.\r\n\r\n    “2 o’clock. I am come up again with a belly-full, _sufficit_.\r\n    Your most deserving, queer character,—your worthy personal\r\n    accomplishments,—your noble endowments of mind,—your little and\r\n    handsome person,—and your obliging and desirable conversation,\r\n    have been the pleasing subject of our discourse for some\r\n    pleasant hours. You have often been in the thoughts of M. B.,\r\n    which I have curiously observed, when with her alone, by inward\r\n    smiles and sighs and abrupt expressions concerning _you_. Shall\r\n    this suffice? I caught her this morning in an humble and devout\r\n    posture on her knees. I am called to read a _Spectator_ to my\r\n    sister Capoon. I long for the time when you are to supply\r\n    my father’s absence. Keep your counsel, and burn this when\r\n    perused. You shall have my reasons in my next. I must conclude,\r\n    and subscribe myself, your most affectionate friend, and\r\n    _brother_ I wish I might write,\r\n\r\n    “ROBERT KIRKHAM.”[54]\r\n\r\nThe above somewhat frothy epistle indicates an important fact, that\r\nWesley was in love with Miss Betty, Kirkham’s sister, or, at all\r\nevents, that Kirkham wished to have him for a brother. Nothing more is\r\nknown of this incipient courtship, except that in a letter to Wesley,\r\ndated five days after Kirkham’s, and written by Martha Wesley, it is\r\nsaid, “When I knew that you were just returned from Worcestershire,\r\nwhere I suppose you saw your _Varanese_, I then ceased to wonder at\r\nyour silence, for the sight of such a woman, ‘so known, so loved,’\r\nmight well make you forget me. I really have myself a vast respect for\r\nher, as I must necessarily have for one that is so dear to you.” Wesley\r\nsoon became far too much immersed in more serious things to have time\r\nto think of wooing. He writes:—\r\n\r\n“Removing to another (Lincoln) college, I began to see more and more\r\nthe value of time. I applied myself closer to study. I watched more\r\ncarefully against actual sins. I advised others to be religious,\r\naccording to that scheme of religion by which I modelled my own life.\r\nBut meeting now with Mr. Law’s ‘Christian Perfection’ and ‘Serious\r\nCall,’ although I was much offended at many parts of both, yet they\r\nconvinced me more than ever of the exceeding height and breadth and\r\ndepth of the law of God. The light flowed in so mightily upon my\r\nsoul, that everything appeared in a new view. I cried to God for\r\nhelp, resolved, as I had never done before, not to prolong the time\r\nof obeying Him. And by my continued endeavour to keep His whole law,\r\ninward and outward, to the utmost of my power, I was persuaded that\r\nI should be accepted of Him, and that I was even then in a state of\r\nsalvation.”[55]\r\n\r\nWilliam Law will have to be noticed hereafter. Suffice it to remark\r\nnow, that, after obtaining a fellowship at Emanuel College, Cambridge,\r\nand officiating as a curate in the metropolis, he refused to take the\r\noaths prescribed by parliament on the accession of George I., lost\r\nhis fellowship, left the pulpit, and became tutor to Edward Gibbon,\r\nfather of the renowned historian. He was now resident at Putney, and\r\nis described as rather above the middle size, stout but not corpulent,\r\nwith broad shoulders, grey eyes, round visage, well-proportioned\r\nfeatures, an open countenance, and rather inclined to be merry than\r\nmournful. His “Christian Perfection” was first published in 1726,\r\njust before Wesley read it; and, in strong, clear, racy language,\r\nmaintains that Christianity requires a change of nature, a renunciation\r\nof the world and worldly tempers, self-denial and mortification, in\r\nshort, a life perfectly devoted to the service of God. Clergymen are\r\nreminded that it is far more important to visit the poor and sick,\r\nand to be wholly occupied in the cure of souls, than in studying the\r\nold grammarians. Vain books and stage entertainments are denounced in\r\nthe strongest terms; and a close imitation of the life and example\r\nof Christ Jesus is enforced with the utmost earnestness. The work\r\nthroughout is one of the most intensely religious books in the English\r\nlanguage; and had it shown the way of attaining holiness as clearly\r\nas it enforces the practice of it, it would in all respects have\r\nbeen unequalled. The “Serious Call” is a kindred book, and written\r\nin the same earnest and pungent style. “It is,” wrote Wesley, within\r\neighteen months of his decease,—“It is a treatise which will hardly be\r\nexcelled, if it be equalled, in the English tongue, either for beauty\r\nof expression, or for justness and depth of thought.”[56]\r\n\r\nThe effect produced upon Wesley,[57] by reading these two invaluable\r\nbooks, was immense. “I was convinced,” says he “more than ever of\r\nthe impossibility of being half a Christian, and determined to\r\nbe all devoted to God, to give Him all my soul, my body, and my\r\nsubstance.”[58]\r\n\r\nWesley’s intentions were as sincere and pure as grace could make them;\r\nbut his ideas of Christian truth were confused, misty, erroneous. He\r\nwas spending several hours every day in reading the Scripture in the\r\noriginal tongues; and yet he tells us that it was not until years\r\nafter this that he became convinced of the great truths, which, above\r\nall other truths, gave rise to the societies of the people called\r\nMethodists. These truths he himself has specified in the following\r\nterms:—“The justification, whereof our articles and homilies speak,\r\nmeans present forgiveness, pardon of sins, and consequently acceptance\r\nwith God. I believe the condition of this is faith; I mean, not\r\nonly that without faith we cannot be justified, but also that, as\r\nsoon as any one has true faith, in that moment he is justified.\r\nGood works follow this faith, but cannot go before it; much less\r\ncan sanctification, which implies a continued course of good works,\r\nspringing from holiness of heart.\r\n\r\n“Repentance must go before faith, and fruits meet for it, if there be\r\nopportunity. By repentance, I mean conviction of sin, producing real\r\ndesires and sincere resolutions of amendment; and by ‘fruits meet for\r\nrepentance,’ I mean forgiving our brother, ceasing from evil and doing\r\ngood, using the ordinances of God, and in general obeying Him according\r\nto the measure of grace which we have received. But these I cannot as\r\nyet term good works; because they do not spring from faith and the love\r\nof God.\r\n\r\n“By salvation I mean, not barely deliverance from hell, or going to\r\nheaven, but a present deliverance from sin, a restoration of the\r\nsoul to its primitive health, its original purity; a recovery of the\r\nDivine nature; the renewal of our souls after the image of God, in\r\nrighteousness and true holiness, in justice, mercy, and truth. This\r\nimplies all holy and heavenly tempers, and by consequence, all holiness\r\nof conversation.\r\n\r\n“Faith is the sole condition of this salvation. Without faith we cannot\r\nthus be saved; for we cannot rightly serve God unless we love Him. And\r\nwe cannot love Him unless we know Him; neither can we know Him unless\r\nby faith.\r\n\r\n“Faith, in general, is a Divine, supernatural evidence, or conviction\r\nof things not seen; that is, of things past, future, or spiritual.\r\nJustifying faith implies, not only a Divine evidence, or conviction,\r\nthat God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself; but a sure\r\ntrust and confidence that Christ died for my sins; that He loved me and\r\ngave Himself for me. And the moment a penitent sinner believes this,\r\nGod pardons and absolves him.\r\n\r\n“And as soon as his pardon or justification is witnessed to him by the\r\nHoly Ghost, he is saved. He loves God and all mankind. He has the mind\r\nthat was in Christ, and power to walk as He also walked. From that time\r\n(unless he makes shipwreck of the faith) salvation gradually increases\r\nin his soul.\r\n\r\n“The Author of faith and salvation is God alone. He is the sole Giver\r\nof every good gift, and the sole Author of every good work. There is\r\nno more of power than of merit in man; but as all merit is in the Son\r\nof God, in what He has done and suffered for us, so all power is in\r\nthe Spirit of God. And therefore every man, in order to believe unto\r\nsalvation, must receive the Holy Ghost. This is essentially necessary\r\nto every Christian, in order to have faith, peace, joy, and love. Whoever\r\nhas these fruits of the Spirit cannot but know and feel that God has\r\nwrought them in his heart.”\r\n\r\nThe reader has here, in Wesley’s own words, a summary of all the\r\ndoctrines which technically may be termed the doctrines of the _first\r\nMethodists_. It was the preaching of these doctrines, and of these\r\nonly, that created Methodism in 1739. And, to be faithful to the\r\nprinciples of their founder, the Methodists of this, and of every age\r\nsucceeding, _must_, MUST make these the _chief_ doctrines of their\r\nministry. Wesley preached other truths besides these: but these were\r\nthe truths which distinguished him from his fellows; which gave birth\r\nto the system that bears his name; and which he always made _prominent_\r\nin his sermons and in his books, to the end of life. Methodism will\r\nsink and deservedly become extinct, when it ceases to proclaim, as its\r\n_greatest_ dogmas, the above summary of Methodistic doctrines, drawn up\r\nby Wesley himself in 1744.\r\n\r\nThis summary is introduced here because, notwithstanding his deep\r\nreligious feeling, his pure intentions, and his strict morality, the\r\ndoctrines it embraces were doctrines of which Wesley remained strangely\r\nignorant for nearly thirteen years after his ordination, in 1725. He\r\nwrites: “It was many years after I was ordained deacon, before I was\r\nconvinced of the great truths above recited. During all that time, I\r\nwas utterly ignorant of the nature and condition of justification.\r\nSometimes I confounded it with sanctification (particularly when I\r\nwas in Georgia); at other times I had some confused notion about the\r\nforgiveness of sins; but then I took it for granted the time of this\r\nmust be either the hour of death, or the day of judgment. I was equally\r\nignorant of the nature of saving faith; apprehending it to mean no more\r\nthan a ‘firm assent to all the propositions contained in the Old and\r\nNew Testaments.’”[59]\r\n\r\nSuch, at this period, were Wesley’s views of Christian truth,\r\nprincipally derived from his mother, from Thomas à Kempis, Jeremy\r\nTaylor, and William Law. Some have charged him with embracing the\r\nmystic divinity, but, except so far as the mystic writers denied the\r\ndoctrine of justification by faith, the charge is unfounded. In reply\r\nto this accusation, Wesley writes: “It is true that, for a while, I\r\nadmired the _mystic writers_. But I dropped them, even before I went to\r\nGeorgia; long before I knew or suspected anything as to justification\r\nby faith. Therefore all that follows of my ‘making my system of\r\ndivinity more commodious for general use,’ having no foundation,\r\nfalls to the ground at once. I never was ‘in the way of mysticism’ at\r\nall.”[60]\r\n\r\nWesley took his degree of Master of Arts, on February 14, 1727. In his\r\ndisputation for this he acquired considerable reputation; delivering\r\nthree lectures on the occasion, one “De Anima Brutorum;” a second, “De\r\nJulio Cæsare;” and a third, “De Amore Dei.” These early orations seem\r\nto be entirely lost.\r\n\r\nAnother step taken by Wesley, about the same period, was to rid himself\r\nof unprofitable friends. He writes: “When it pleased God to give me\r\na settled resolution to be not a _nominal_, but a _real_ Christian\r\n(being then about twenty-two years of age), my acquaintance were as\r\nignorant of God as myself. But there was this difference: I knew my\r\nown ignorance; they did not know theirs. I faintly endeavoured to\r\nhelp them, but in vain. Meantime, I found, by sad experience, that\r\neven their _harmless_ conversation, so called, damped all my good\r\nresolutions. I saw no possible way of getting rid of them, unless it\r\nshould please God to remove me to another college. He did so, in a\r\nmanner utterly contrary to all human probability. I was elected fellow\r\nof a college where I knew not one person. I foresaw abundance of people\r\nwould come to see me, either out of friendship, civility, or curiosity;\r\nand that I should have offers of acquaintance new and old: but I had\r\nnow fixed my plan. I resolved to have no acquaintance by chance, but by\r\nchoice; and to choose such only as would help me on my way to heaven.\r\nIn consequence of this, I narrowly observed the temper and behaviour of\r\nall that visited me. I saw no reason to think that the greater part of\r\nthese truly loved or feared God: therefore, when any of them came to\r\nsee me, I behaved as courteously as I could; but to the question, ‘When\r\nwill you come to see me?’ I returned no answer. When they had come a\r\nfew times, and found I still declined returning the visit, I saw them\r\nno more. And, I bless God, this has been my invariable rule for about\r\nthree-score years. I knew many reflections would follow; but that did\r\nnot move me, as I knew full well it was my calling to go through evil\r\nreport and good report.”[61]\r\n\r\nThus did Wesley free himself from trifling companions. About the same\r\ntime, some one proposed to him a well endowed school in Yorkshire, and\r\nsuggested, as an inducement for him to accept it, that it was situated\r\n“in a little vale, so pent up between two hills” that it was scarcely\r\naccessible; a place where he could “expect little company from without,\r\nand within none at all.”[62] This school was either never offered, or,\r\nif it was, the offer was declined.\r\n\r\nWesley now laid down a plan of study, and closely followed it. Mondays\r\nand Tuesdays he devoted to the Greek and Roman classics, historians and\r\npoets; Wednesdays, to logic and ethics; Thursdays to Hebrew and Arabic;\r\nFridays to metaphysics and natural philosophy; Saturdays to oratory and\r\npoetry, chiefly composing; and Sundays, to divinity. In intermediate\r\nhours, he perfected himself in the French language, which he had\r\nbegun to learn two or three years before; sometimes amused himself\r\nwith experiments in optics; and in mathematics studied Euclid, Keil,\r\nand Sir Isaac Newton. First, he read an author regularly through, and\r\nthen transcribed into a commonplace book such passages as he thought\r\nimportant or beautiful. In this way he greatly increased his stock of\r\nknowledge and inured himself to hard working.\r\n\r\nHis father was now sixty-five years of age, and was already palsied;\r\nhis mother also was in exceedingly ill health; and hence, in August,\r\n1727, he removed to Lincolnshire, for the purpose of officiating as his\r\nfather’s curate at Epworth and at Wroote; and here, with the exception\r\nof about three months, he remained until November, 1729.\r\n\r\nThe details of this period of two years and a quarter in Wesley’s\r\nhistory are few. His life at Epworth and Wroote was doubtless the\r\nordinary every-day sort of life of an earnest country parish clergyman.\r\nFortunately, one of his sermons, preached during the time that he was\r\nhis father’s curate, has been preserved, and is important as showing\r\nhow, from the very commencement of his ministry, he rigidly adhered to\r\nthe principle of preaching the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but\r\nthe truth. The text is 2 Corinthians ii. 17, and the subject of the\r\nsermon is that of “corrupting the word of God.” Among corrupters he\r\nnotices:—1. Those who introduce “into it human mixtures, and blend with\r\nthe oracles of God impure dreams, fit only for the mouth of the devil.”\r\n2. Those who mix it “with false interpretations.” 3. Those who do not\r\nadd to it but take from it, “washing their hands of stubborn texts,\r\nthat will not bend to their purposes, or that too plainly touch upon\r\nthe reigning vices of the places where they live.” Those who do not\r\ncorrupt the word of God “preach it genuine and unmixed,” unimpaired and\r\nin all its fulness. “They speak with plainness and boldness, and are\r\nnot concerned to palliate their doctrine to reconcile it to the tastes\r\nof men. They will not, they dare not, soften a threatening so as to\r\nprejudice its strength; neither represent sin in such mild colours as\r\nto impair its native blackness.”[63]\r\n\r\nHere we have Wesley, in the twenty-fifth year of his age, displaying\r\nthe same conscientious fidelity and unflinching boldness, which so\r\nstrikingly characterized the whole of his future ministry.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1728, Wesley repaired to Oxford, where, on Sunday, September\r\n22, he was ordained priest by Dr. Potter, who had ordained him deacon\r\nin 1725. Nine days afterwards, he returned to his curacy at Wroote,\r\nwhere, as already stated, he continued preaching and fulfilling other\r\nministerial duties until November 22, 1729.\r\n\r\nWhat were the results of Wesley’s preaching? Wesley himself shall tell\r\nus. He writes: “I preached much, but saw no fruit of my labour. Indeed,\r\nit could not be that I should; for I neither laid the foundation of\r\nrepentance, nor of believing the gospel; taking it for granted that\r\nall to whom I preached were believers, and that many of them needed\r\nno repentance.”[64] Let Christian ministers be admonished. Is it not\r\na fact—a general, if not universal fact—that where these doctrines\r\nare not preached all other preaching is almost, if not altogether,\r\nuseless? Christ’s ministry throughout was in perfect accordance with\r\nits commencement, when following John the Baptist, as His high herald,\r\nHe cried, “Repent ye, and believe the gospel.” This kind of preaching\r\nis always useful. Would to God we had more of it at the present day!\r\n\r\nWroote was a wretched place. Wesley says it was “surrounded with\r\nbogs;”[65] and, according to Samuel, his brother, the parsonage was\r\nroofed with thatch and made lively by the mingled music of “kittens\r\nand whelps,” “pigs and porkets,” “bellowing kine and bleating lambs,\r\nquacking ducks and fluttering hens.” Describing his father’s presence\r\nthere, he writes:—\r\n\r\n    “Methinks I see you striving all\r\n    Who first shall answer to his call,\r\n    Or lusty Nan or feeble Moll,\r\n    Sage Pat, or sober Hetty;\r\n    To rub his cassock’s draggled tail,\r\n    Or reach his hat from off the nail,\r\n    Or seek the key to draw his ale,\r\n      When damsel haps to steal it;\r\n\r\n    To burn his pipe, or mend his clothes,\r\n    Or nicely darn his russet hose,\r\n    For comfort of his aged toes,\r\n      So fine they cannot feel it.”[66]\r\n\r\nThe church was a small brick building, and the population, even as\r\nlate as 1821, was under three hundred. The people were, says Mehetabel\r\nWesley, “unpolished wights,” as “dull as asses,” and with heads “as\r\nimpervious as stones.”\r\n\r\nSuch were Wesley’s parish and parishioners—not exactly the place where\r\na poetical genius and classic scholar was likely to luxuriate; and\r\nyet there is no reason to entertain a doubt that Wesley was happy in\r\nhis new sphere of labour. He loved retirement, and here he had it. It\r\nis not improbable that, for many a long year, Wroote would have been\r\nhis residence, had not the rector of Lincoln College wished to have\r\nhim back to Oxford. This gentleman had rendered such service to the\r\nWesley family that the venerable father used to say, “I can refuse him\r\nnothing.”[67] Accordingly, the following letter, by Dr. Morley, was\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\n    “_October 21, 1729._\r\n\r\n    “At a meeting of the society, just before I left college, to\r\n    consider the proper method to preserve discipline and good\r\n    government, it was, in the opinion of all present, judged\r\n    necessary that the junior fellows, who should be chosen\r\n    moderators, shall in person attend the duties of their office,\r\n    if they do not prevail with some of the fellows to officiate\r\n    for them. We all thought it would be a great hardship on Mr.\r\n    Fenton to call him from a perpetual curacy; yet this we must\r\n    have done, had not Mr. Hutchins been so kind to him and us as\r\n    to engage to supply his place in the hall for the present year.\r\n    Mr. Robinson would as willingly supply yours, but the serving\r\n    of two cures, about fourteen miles from Oxford, makes it, he\r\n    says, impossible to discharge the duty constantly. We hope\r\n    it may be as much for your advantage to reside at college as\r\n    where you are, if you take pupils, or can get a curacy in the\r\n    neighbourhood of Oxon. Your father may certainly have another\r\n    curate, though not so much to his satisfaction; yet we are\r\n    persuaded that this will not move him to hinder your return to\r\n    college, since the interests of the college and obligation to\r\n    statute require it.”\r\n\r\nAnd so, because Fenton had a perpetual curacy, too good to be given\r\nup; and because Robinson, in his two parishes, had as much work as he\r\ncould do, Wesley was forcibly removed from Wroote, and brought back\r\nto Oxford to fulfil his functions as a fellow. No time was lost. He\r\nreturned to Oxford on November 22, 1729, and here continued until he\r\nembarked for Georgia on the 14th of October, 1735.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_OXFORD METHODISM, ETC._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1729 Age 26]\r\n\r\nWesley returned to Oxford shortly after the coronation of George II.\r\nIn some respects this was an age of giants. Bolingbroke, though a rake\r\nand an infidel, was a man of exalted powers and of splendid eloquence.\r\nWalpole, more than any other man, was the means of keeping the British\r\ncrown on the heads of the house of Hanover. The Earl of Granville, by\r\nhis brilliant talents, raised himself to the highest offices of state;\r\nthough, thinking ignorance the best security for obedience, he opposed\r\nthe education of the poor, and disliked the propagation of Christ’s\r\nreligion in the colonies. Chesterfield was a gambler and a _roué_, but,\r\nas Johnson said, “he was also a wit among lords, and a lord among wits.”\r\n\r\nIn the Church, Atterbury, though a Jacobite, passionate, ambitious,\r\nand double dealing, was also talented, learned, and eloquent. Whiston,\r\nthough extremely heterodox, was a man of great ability. Gibson, Bishop\r\nof London, was one whose piety was equal to his erudition. Hoadly,\r\nBishop of Winchester, has, not without reason, been pronounced “the\r\ngreatest dissenter that ever wore a mitre.” Sherlock was famous for his\r\npulpit power. The head of Waterland was “an immense library, where the\r\ntreasures of learning were arranged in such exact order that whatever\r\nhe or his friends wanted he could produce at once.” To these might be\r\nadded Butler, Secker, Warburton, and others.\r\n\r\nAmong the Dissenters we find Edmund Calamy, Isaac Watts, Nathaniel\r\nLardner, and Philip Doddridge.\r\n\r\nAmong men of science and of letters, Edmund Halley was exploring the\r\nstarry heavens; and Sir Hans Sloane was revelling among the plants\r\nand flowers of earth. Nicholas Saunderson, blind from childhood, was\r\nlecturing upon optics; Roubiliac was making marble almost breathe, and\r\nHandel composing his immortal oratorios. Tindal was pouring out his\r\nstreams of erudite infidelity. Daniel De Foe was still living. Bentley\r\nwas at the zenith of his literary fame. Jonathan Swift was playing the\r\npart of a clever ecclesiastical buffoon. Edward Young was pondering\r\npoetry among the tombs of his own churchyard. Pope was employing his\r\naccomplished genius, surrounded by the beauties of his lovely retreat\r\nat Twickenham. Gay was composing comedies with more ability than\r\nambition. Richardson, afterwards the novelist, was writing “indexes,\r\nprefaces, and honest dedications.” Savage was penning beautiful ideas\r\namid tavern riots and cellar filth. Thomson, so lazy as to be a fit\r\noccupant for his own “Castle of Indolence,” was suffering his eye to\r\nroll in a fine frenzy among the beauties of the “Seasons;” and Samuel\r\nJohnson was preparing himself to be the Jupiter of letters, and to rule\r\nthe literary world.\r\n\r\nGreatness unfortunately does not always give birth to goodness.\r\n“Never,” says a modern writer,[68] “has century risen on Christian\r\nEngland so void of soul and faith as that which opened with Queen Anne,\r\nand which reached its misty noon beneath the second George—a dewless\r\nnight succeeded by a sunless dawn. There was no freshness in the\r\npast, and no promise in the future. The Puritans were buried, and the\r\nMethodists were not born. The philosopher of the age was Bolingbroke,\r\nthe moralist was Addison, the minstrel was Pope, and the preacher was\r\nAtterbury. The world had the idle, discontented look of the morning\r\nafter some mad holiday, and, like rocket-sticks and the singed paper\r\nfrom last night’s squibs, the spent jokes of Charles and Rochester lay\r\nall about, and people yawned to look at them. The reign of buffoonery\r\nwas past, but the reign of faith and earnestness had not commenced.”\r\n\r\nLet it not be said that this is modern imagination. Bishops are, or\r\nought to be, sober minded men, and to one of these we refer the reader\r\nfor a testimony concerning the moral and religious state of England\r\nduring the period of which we are now writing. The Bishop of Lichfield,\r\nin 1724, in a sermon before the Society for the Reformation of Manners,\r\nsaid:—\r\n\r\n“The Lord’s day is now the devil’s market day. More lewdness, more\r\ndrunkenness, more quarrels and murders, more sin is contrived and\r\ncommitted on this day than on all the other days of the week together.\r\nStrong liquors are become the epidemic distemper of this great city.\r\nMore of the common people die of consumptions, fevers, dropsies,\r\ncholics, palsies, and apoplexies, contracted by the immoderate use of\r\nbrandies and distilled waters, than of all other distempers besides,\r\narising from other causes. Sin, in general, is grown so hardened\r\nand rampant, as that immoralities are defended, yea, justified on\r\nprinciple. Obscene, wanton, and profane books find so good a market as\r\nto encourage the trade of publishing them. Every kind of sin has found\r\na writer to teach and vindicate it, and a bookseller and hawker to\r\ndivulge and spread it.”\r\n\r\nThese were not rash and random statements. From the report of the\r\nsociety before which the bishop preached, it appears that in that very\r\nyear, 1724, the society had prosecuted not fewer than 2723 persons\r\nfor lewd, profane, drunken, and gambling practices; and that during\r\nthe last thirty-three years the number of their prosecutions had been\r\n89,393.\r\n\r\nFrom the literature of the period, we learn that gin-drinking in\r\nthe great towns of England had become a mania; the sellers of this\r\npernicious spirit announcing on their signboards that they would make\r\na man drunk for a penny, and find him straw on which to lie till he\r\nrecovered the use of his lost faculties. In 1736 every sixth house in\r\nLondon was a licensed grogshop, and parliament, to check the evil,\r\nenacted that all intoxicating spirits should pay a duty of £1 per\r\ngallon, and every victualler £50 per annum for his licence.\r\n\r\nIn the higher classes of society, the taint left by Charles II and his\r\nlicentious court still festered. Among the lower classes, laziness\r\nand dishonesty were next to universal. Superstition flourished almost\r\nas vigorously as it had done in the middle ages, and nearly every\r\nold mansion in England was haunted by a ghost, and almost every\r\nparish tormented by a witch. In the metropolis, Ranelagh and Vauxhall\r\nwere the resorts of thousands, of the upper strata of society; and\r\npuppetshows, hops, balls, prize-fights, merry meetings, cockfights, and\r\nbadger-baitings furnished entertainment for the masses. In the rural\r\ndistricts, rustic squires found their greatest enjoyment in hunting\r\nfoxes, and in gorging venison, and guzzling sack; while the peasantry\r\nrelieved the monotony of their daily toils at wakes and fairs, and in\r\nwrestling, cudgel playing, and foot racing.\r\n\r\nExtravagance was the order of the day. Scarcely one family in ten\r\nkept within its income. The grand controversy then, as now, was, who\r\nshould _out-dress_, _out-drink_, or _out-eat_ his neighbour. Citizens\r\nand young tradesmen, whose ancestors would have fainted at the sight\r\nof drawing-rooms, were the chief visitors at plays and masquerades;\r\nand even shopkeepers were seen wearing long wigs and swords, velvet\r\nbreeches and hunting caps. Families, who were oftentimes resolved\r\ninto committees on ways and means to pay a butcher’s bill, paraded\r\nthemselves in attire the most pompous, and adorned with the richest\r\nbrocades and jewels. London swarmed with ruined rakes and broken\r\ntraders, who contrived to live in the best society by reciting scraps\r\nof poetry, singing licentious songs, and retailing drunken puns and\r\nquibbles. In fact, all ranks and classes seemed to be corrupted to the\r\ncore. “A sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil\r\ndoers; children that are corrupters; the whole head is sick, and the\r\nwhole heart faint; from the sole of the foot even unto the head, there\r\nis no soundness in it, but wounds, bruises, and putrifying sores.”\r\n\r\nWhat was done to improve this state of things? From a report of the\r\ncharity schools, we learn that, in 1715, there were, throughout the\r\nkingdom, 1193 schools for the education of the children of the poor,\r\ncontaining 26,920 scholars. In other words, and to say nothing of other\r\nchurches, there are at present in the Wesleyan-Methodist day-schools of\r\nEngland four times more scholars than there were in all the schools for\r\nprimary education throughout the kingdom in 1715.\r\n\r\nTurning from schools to churches, there is no amelioration of the dark\r\npicture. The Church, which ought to have reformed the nation, needed\r\nto be reformed itself. The Dissenters complained of their ministers\r\nconforming to the Establishment, but comforted themselves with thinking\r\nthat the apostates were mainly young fops and dandies. The three\r\nDissenting denominations, Presbyterians, Independents, and Baptists,\r\nconsidered themselves the great barriers to the doctrine of passive\r\nobedience to the crown, and of submission to the priestly encroachments\r\nof the Church. They maintained that they had greatly contributed to\r\nthe interests of the Protestant succession, and had promoted a better\r\nobservance of the sabbath, and the more frequent preaching of the high\r\nchurch clergy; but still they lamented that numbers of their ministers\r\nwere immoral, negligent, and insufficient; that they devoted too much\r\ntime to the fashionable study of the classics, and read their sermons\r\ninstead of preaching them. They also complained of their children\r\nbeing sent to high church schools, and of the artful caballing of\r\ntheir congregations in appointing ministers to vacant pastorates. (See\r\n“Observations upon the Present State of the Dissenting Interest.”\r\nLondon: 1731.)\r\n\r\nThe clergy of the Established Church! What of them? Bishop Burnet, in\r\n1713, wrote: “Our ember weeks are the burden and grief of my life. The\r\nmuch greater part of those who come to be ordained are ignorant to a\r\ndegree not to be apprehended by those who are not obliged to know it.\r\nThe easiest part of knowledge is that to which they are the greatest\r\nstrangers; I mean the plainest parts of the Scriptures. They can give\r\nno account, or at least a very imperfect one, of the contents even of\r\nthe gospels, or of the catechism itself.”\r\n\r\nThis is a doleful picture, but there was more than this. The\r\ndissensions in the Church of England then were quite as violent as\r\ndissensions now. The high church clergy were moral, and many of them\r\ntalented and learned, but they were as intolerant as intolerance could\r\nmake them. Of course, they held that none were ministers of Christ\r\nexcept those who had been _episcopally_ ordained; and hence they held\r\nthat all sacraments administered by Dissenters were invalid, and all\r\nDissenting churches in a state of sin and damnation. They boldly\r\npreached the doctrine of a proper sacrifice being made in the Christian\r\neucharist, and most furiously contended for the Divine right of kings,\r\nand the kindred dogma of passive obedience. Many of them, in heart at\r\nleast, were Jacobites, and, while promising allegiance, regarded King\r\nGeorge as a usurper, and branded those of their brethren who differed\r\nfrom them with opprobrium. Endless were the pamphlets published, and\r\nfierce were the feuds of those who ought to have dwelt together in\r\nunity. The foulest sins were made sinless by intemperate zeal for the\r\nPretender, and the fairest virtues were besmeared in those who showed a\r\nfriendly feeling for Dissenters. A man might be drunken and quarrelsome\r\nall the week, but if on Sunday he bowed to the altar and cursed King\r\nWilliam he was esteemed a saint. He might cheat everybody, and pay\r\nnobody, but if he drank health to the royal orphan, hated King George,\r\nand abhorred the Whigs, his want of probity was a peccadillo scarce\r\nworth noticing. On the other hand, a man might be learned, diligent,\r\ndevout, and useful, but if he opposed the Pretender and Popery, or if\r\nhe thought the Dissenters should not be damned, he was at once set down\r\nas heterodox, and, according to his importance, became a target for the\r\npoisoned shafts of high church malice.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, was the state of things when God raised up the\r\nMethodists. The court of England was corrupt to its very core, and\r\nthe people were too faithful imitators of a bad example. Popery was\r\nintriguing, Dissenters were declining, and the Church was full of fiery\r\nand drunken feuds. Reformers, like the Methodists, were needed. Without\r\nthem, or others of a kindred spirit, the nation must have sunk into an\r\ninconceivable depth of depravity, and social and political degradation.\r\nIn estimating the benefits which have accrued from the great Methodist\r\nmovement, the reader must think not only of the good effected but of\r\nthe ill averted.\r\n\r\nMethodism arose in Oxford, and not before it was needed, even there.\r\nWhen Wesley returned to the university in 1729, the vice-chancellor,\r\nthe heads of houses and proctors, issued an edict, which was posted in\r\nmost of the college halls, to the effect that certain members of the\r\nuniversity had of late been in danger of being corrupted by the wicked\r\nand blasphemous notions of the advocates of pretended human reason\r\nagainst Divine revelation; and that therefore it was a matter of the\r\nutmost consequence that the college tutors should use double diligence\r\nin explaining to their respective pupils the articles of religion and\r\ntheir Christian duty, and in recommending to them the frequent and\r\ncareful reading of the Scriptures, and such other books as might serve\r\nmore effectually the orthodox faith and sound principles.\r\n\r\nThe Dean of Christ Church, however, where Charles Wesley was a tutor,\r\nwas so much a friend to infidelity, that he forbade the posting of this\r\nedict in his college hall, forgetting that there was One higher than\r\nhimself, who, in that very college, had already begun to raise one of\r\nthe strongest barriers against the spread of this pernicious evil.\r\n\r\nA few months afterwards, on the 4th of July, 1730, it was announced\r\nin _Fogg’s Weekly Journal_, that one of the principal colleges in\r\nOxford had of late been infested with Deists, and that three Deistical\r\nstudents had been expelled, and a fourth had had his degree deferred\r\ntwo years, during which he was to be closely confined in college, and,\r\namong other things, was to translate Leslie’s “Short and Easy Method\r\nwith the Deists.”\r\n\r\nWesley was now a tutor in Lincoln College, and presided in the hall\r\nas Moderator in the disputations, six of which were held weekly; and,\r\nby this, he acquired the remarkable expertness in arguing, and in\r\ndiscerning and pointing out well concealed and plausible fallacies,\r\nwhich distinguished him to the end of life. He writes: “In November,\r\n1729, the then Rector of Lincoln College, Dr. Morley, sent for me\r\nto Oxford, to take pupils, eleven of whom he put under my care\r\nimmediately. In this employ I continued[69] till 1735, when I went as\r\na _missioner_ to Georgia.” Several of Wesley’s pupils were among the\r\nfirst Oxford Methodists.\r\n\r\nThe Methodist movement, however, was begun not by Wesley, but by his\r\nbrother Charles. When the latter was elected to Christ Church, in 1726,\r\nhe was a sprightly, rollicking young fellow, with more genius than\r\ngrace; John spoke to him about religion, but Charles answered, “What,\r\nwould you have me to be a saint all at once!” This was an unfavourable\r\nbeginning; but, while John was serving as his father’s curate at\r\nEpworth and at Wroote, Charles began to attend the weekly sacrament,\r\nand induced two or three other students to attend with him. On John’s\r\nreturn from Lincolnshire, he heartily united with his brother and his\r\nfriends. The regularity of their behaviour led a young collegian to\r\ncall them Methodists; and “as the name,” says Wesley, “was new and\r\nquaint, it clave to them immediately, and, from that time, all that had\r\nany connection with them were thus distinguished.”[70]\r\n\r\nThe name was not new. Wesley says “it was given in allusion to an\r\nancient sect of physicians, of the time of the Emperor Nero, who taught\r\nthat almost all diseases might be cured by a specific _method_ of diet\r\nand exercise.”[71] This might be so, and yet it is a curious fact that\r\nthe name was in use in England long before it was applied to Wesley and\r\nhis friends. In 1693 a pamphlet was published with the title, “A War\r\namong the Angels of the Churches: wherein is shewed the Principles of\r\nthe New Methodists in the great point of Justification. By a Country\r\nProfessor of Jesus Christ.” And even as early as 1639, in a sermon\r\npreached at Lambeth the following perfumed eloquence occurs:—“Where are\r\nnow our Anabaptists, and plain pack-staff Methodists, who esteem all\r\nflowers of rhetoric in sermons no better than stinking weeds, and all\r\nelegance of speech no better than profane spells?”\r\n\r\nThe two young gentlemen who, with Wesley and his brother Charles, were\r\nfirst called Methodists, were Robert Kirkham, already mentioned on\r\na previous page, and William Morgan.[72] To these were subsequently\r\nadded, George Whitefield, John Clayton, J. Broughton, Benjamin Ingham,\r\nJames Hervey, John Whitelamb, Westley Hall, John Gambold, Charles\r\nKinchin, William Smith, and Messrs. Salmon, Wogan, Boyce, Atkinson, and\r\nothers.[73]\r\n\r\nWhat shall we say of these Oxford Methodists?\r\n\r\nWilliam Morgan’s career was brief and painful; he was the first\r\nMethodist who passed the pearly gates of the celestial city. Charles\r\nKinchin, a lovely character, soon followed him. Charles Wesley, in\r\nhis incomparable hymns, left behind him one of the noblest legacies\r\nthat an uninspired man ever bequeathed to the Christian church. George\r\nWhitefield was the prince of preachers—a glorious emblem of the\r\napocalyptic angel flying through the midst of heaven with the good\r\ntidings of great joy unto all people. And James Hervey will be loved\r\nand honoured as long as there are men to appreciate the highest order\r\nof Christian piety and the most mellifluent compositions in the English\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Oxford Methodists is not, however, an unspotted\r\none. Clayton’s high churchism was not an excellency to be admired.\r\nBroughton’s usefulness was crippled and cut short by his imperfect,\r\nstunted, stereotyped views of Christian truth. Westley Hall, though\r\nwe hope he died a penitent, was, throughout the greatest part of his\r\nvicious life, an unmitigated scamp. John Whitelamb sunk down into an\r\necclesiastical village drone. Gambold, though good, was visionary, and\r\nthroughout life was injured by his Moravian maggots. And Ingham, for\r\nmany years one of the most successful of evangelists, through the ill\r\njudged connections that he formed, died beneath a cloud. But, with\r\nall these drawbacks, the reader is challenged to produce a band of\r\ngodly friends, whose lives and labours have, upon the whole, issued\r\nin such an amount of blessing to mankind as that which has resulted\r\nfrom the lives and labours of the students who, in 1735, were known\r\nas “Oxford Methodists.” They were widely scattered; their views were\r\ndifferent; they were often brought into painful collision with each\r\nother; but, with the one or two exceptions mentioned, they were all\r\nsincere, earnest, laborious, successful ministers of Christ; and five\r\nor six of them must for ever occupy a high position in the history of\r\nthe Christian church. Clayton shunned the Wesleys; Broughton opposed\r\nthem; Ingham left them; Hervey, though with Christian courtesy, wrote\r\nagainst them; Gambold, at one period, hesitated not to say that he was\r\nashamed of them; and even Whitefield, for a little while, was alienated\r\nfrom them; but we earnestly hope and have little doubt that they have\r\nall long been re-united in that blessed world where friends are free\r\nfrom misconceptions, and where the din of controversial strife does not\r\nexist—a world where all churches are merged into one grand Church, the\r\nmembers of which make one vast, happy, and harmonious family, and sing\r\nin the same ceaseless tune the same great song for ever—the song of\r\nMoses and of the Lamb.\r\n\r\nOf the Methodists, three were tutors in colleges; and the rest were\r\nbachelors of arts, or undergraduates. All were of one judgment and\r\nof one heart; and all tenacious of order to the last degree, and\r\nobservant, for conscience sake, of every rule of the Church, and every\r\nstatute both of the university and of their respective colleges. They\r\nall thought themselves orthodox in every point, firmly believing, not\r\nonly the three creeds, but whatsoever they judged to be the doctrine\r\nof the Church of England, as contained in her articles and homilies.\r\nPractically, they had all things common; and no one was allowed to want\r\nwhat another had the ability to spare.[74] Wesley was nicknamed “the\r\nCurator of the Holy Club,” and not a few branded him a “crack-brained\r\nenthusiast”; and yet others acknowledged that though his views and\r\ndoctrines were peculiar his piety was unimpeachable; and Mr. Gerard,\r\nthe bishop’s chaplain, dared to express an opinion to George Lascelles,\r\none of his revilers, that he “would one day be a standard-bearer of\r\nthe Cross, either in his own country or beyond the seas.”[75] Charles\r\nWesley paid the utmost deference to his brother, and all the Methodists\r\nacknowledged his fitness to be their chief director. This was not\r\nsurprising, for, confessedly, he had more learning and experience than\r\nthe others; and was blessed with such activity and steadiness that\r\nhe was always gaining ground, and losing none. Every affair was well\r\nconsidered before he propounded it, and all his decisions were made in\r\nthe fear of God, without passion, or self-confidence. His countenance\r\nalso wore an air of authority; and yet there was no assumption of\r\nsuper-eminence; but all were allowed to speak their minds with the\r\nutmost freedom, and no one was a more respectful listener than himself.\r\nHence it was, that, whatever proposals he submitted, they were readily\r\nadopted, and the brotherhood was as perfect as unity of sentiment and\r\nfeeling could make it.\r\n\r\nEvery night they met together,[76] to review what each had done\r\nduring the day, and to consult what should be done the day following;\r\ntheir meetings always commencing with prayer, and ending with a frugal\r\nsupper. Their plans of action were various. Some conversed with young\r\nstudents, and endeavoured to rescue them from evil company, and to\r\nencourage them in a sober and studious life. Others undertook the\r\ninstruction and relief of impoverished families; others the charge of\r\nsome particular school, and others of the parish workhouse. Some or\r\nother of them went daily to the Castle, and to the city prison, reading\r\nin the chapel, to as many of the prisoners as would attend, books\r\nlike the “Christian Monitor” and the “Country Parson’s Advice to his\r\nParishioners,” and then summing up the reading in a few sentences easy\r\nto be remembered. On the introduction of a new prisoner, they would\r\nsubject him to the most searching examination as to whether he bore\r\nmalice towards his prosecutors or others, and whether he repented of\r\nhis sins, and used private prayer, and received the sacrament. Out of\r\ntheir own scanty means, and by quarterly contributions from others,\r\nthey raised a fund to purchase books, medicines, and other necessaries\r\nfor the prisoners, and to release those who were confined for debts\r\nof small amount. They read prayers at the Castle on most Wednesdays\r\nand Fridays, preached a sermon to the prisoners every Sunday, and\r\nadministered the sacrament once a month. One of the schools which they\r\nvisited was a school which Wesley himself had founded, the mistress\r\nof which he paid, and some, if not all, of the children of which he\r\nclothed.\r\n\r\nIn all this the world saw nought but oddity and folly, and called these\r\nhardworking and godly students “Bible bigots,” and “Bible moths;”\r\nbut, in the midst of all, Wesley calmly pursued the path which he had\r\nmarked out for himself and his friends. Gambold, in a letter written\r\nwhilst Wesley was in Georgia, tells us that Wesley at Oxford was always\r\ncheerful but never arrogant. By strict watchfulness, he beat down the\r\nimpetuosity of his nature into a childlike simplicity. His piety was\r\nnourished by continual communion with God, for he thought prayer to\r\nbe his greatest duty; and often did Gambold see him come out of his\r\ncloset of devotion with a serenity of countenance that was next to\r\nshining. The secret consolations of God seldom left him, and never\r\nbut in a posture of strong and longsuffering faith. In him there were\r\nno idle cravings, no chagrin or sickliness of spirit. Slanders never\r\nruffled him, and his chief fear was lest he should grow proud of this\r\nconformity to his great Master. Coming home from long journeys, where\r\nhe had been in different companies, he would calmly resume his usual\r\nemployments, as if he had never left them. Himself setting an example,\r\nhe urged upon his associates method, diligence, and early rising. His\r\nhours for private devotion were from five to six o’clock every morning\r\nand every night. Every day he noted in a diary what had been his chief\r\nemployments; and one day every week he set apart for writing letters to\r\nhis friends.[77]\r\n\r\nHis charity to the poor was limited only by the means at his command.\r\nOne cold winter’s day, he tells us, a young girl, whom the Methodists\r\nkept at school, called upon him in a state nearly frozen, to whom he\r\nsaid, “You seem half-starved; have you nothing to wear but that linen\r\ngown?” The poor girl said, “Sir, this is all I have.” Wesley put his\r\nhand in his pocket, but found it nearly empty. The walls of his chamber\r\nhowever were hung with pictures, and these now became his accusers.\r\n“It struck me,” says he, “will thy Master say, ‘Well done, good and\r\nfaithful steward’? thou hast adorned thy walls with the money which\r\nmight have screened this poor creature from the cold! O Justice! O\r\nMercy! Are not these pictures the blood of this poor maid?”[78] To\r\nsay the least, this story shows the intense conscientiousness of the\r\nman, and his dread of spending anything upon himself which might have\r\nbeen spent more properly upon the poor. He says it was the practice of\r\nall the Oxford Methodists to give away each year all they had after\r\nproviding for their own necessities; and then, as an illustration, he\r\nadds, in reference to himself, “One of them had thirty pounds a year.\r\nHe lived on twenty-eight, and gave away forty shillings. The next year\r\nreceiving sixty pounds, he still lived on twenty-eight, and gave away\r\nthirty-two. The third year he received ninety pounds, and gave away\r\nsixty-two. The fourth year he received a hundred and twenty pounds;\r\nstill he lived as before on twenty-eight, and gave to the poor all the\r\nrest.”[79]\r\n\r\nWesley at Oxford was as conscientious in the use of time as he was in\r\nthe use of money. Finding that he awoke every night about twelve or\r\none o’clock, he concluded that this arose from his lying longer in bed\r\nthan nature needed; and, to satisfy himself, he procured an alarum\r\nwhich aroused him next morning at seven, an hour earlier than he rose\r\nthe day previous; but still he lay awake again at night. The second\r\nmorning his alarum roused him up at six; and the third at five; but\r\nnotwithstanding this he still lay awake when he ought to have been fast\r\nasleep. The fourth morning, by means of his alarum, he got up at four,\r\nand now wakefulness was unknown to him. Sixty years after adopting this\r\nexpedient to ascertain how much sleep his nature needed, he wrote, “By\r\nthe grace of God, I have risen at four o’clock ever since; and, taking\r\nthe year round, I don’t lie awake a quarter of an hour together in a\r\nmonth.”[80]\r\n\r\nThe Bible now, as ever afterwards, was Wesley’s book of books.\r\nHe writes: “In 1729, I began not only to read, but to study, the\r\nBible, as the one, the only standard of truth, and the only model\r\nof pure religion. Hence, I saw, in a clearer and clearer light, the\r\nindispensable necessity of having ‘the mind which was in Christ,’\r\nand of ‘walking as Christ also walked.’ I considered religion as an\r\nentire inward and outward conformity to our Master. Nor was I afraid of\r\nanything more than of bending this rule to the experience of myself, or\r\nof other men; or of allowing myself in any the least disconformity to\r\nour grand Exemplar.”[81]\r\n\r\nSuch was Wesley in 1729. What about his friends? To some extent,\r\ntheir principles and practice may be learnt from the scheme of\r\nself-examination they adopted. They tried to act upon the principle\r\nof doing nothing without a previous perception that it was the will\r\nof God. Every morning and every evening they spent an hour in private\r\nprayer. They always prayed in going in and out of church. Three days\r\nevery week, though separate from each other, they, at the same hour,\r\nprayed in concert. In secret devotion they frequently stopped short to\r\nobserve if they were using proper fervour, and, before concluding in\r\nthe name of Christ, they adverted to the Saviour now interceding on\r\ntheir behalf at the right hand of God, and offering up their prayers.\r\nThey habituated themselves to the use of ejaculations for humility,\r\nfaith, hope, and love; used a collect every day at nine, twelve, and\r\nthree o’clock; and each one said aloud, in his own room, a grace\r\nbefore and after eating. They embraced every possible opportunity of\r\ndoing good, and of preventing, removing, or lessening evil. They tried\r\nto spend an hour every day in speaking to men directly on religious\r\nthings, never relinquishing the objects of their attention till\r\nthey were positively repelled, and always, before addressing them,\r\ntrying to learn, as far as possible, their tempers, way of life, and\r\npeculiar hindrances. In order to converse usefully, they planned every\r\nconversation before they went into company; and considered what subject\r\nwould be most useful, and how to prosecute it.[82] They persuaded all\r\nthey could to attend public prayers, sermons, and sacraments; and,\r\nin general, to obey the laws of the church catholic, the Church of\r\nEngland, the state, the university, and their respective colleges.\r\nThey refrained from thinking or speaking unkindly of any one; and used\r\nintercession for their friends on Sundays, for their pupils on Mondays,\r\nfor those who particularly desired it on Wednesdays and Fridays,\r\nand for the family with whom they lodged every day.[83] They also\r\ncommunicated at Christ Church once a week.[84]\r\n\r\nThey had one, and only one, rule of judgment, with regard to all their\r\ntempers, words, and actions—namely, the oracles of God, and were one\r\nand all determined to be Bible Christians. The book which, next to the\r\nholy Scripture, was of the greatest use to them, in settling their\r\njudgment as to the grand point of justification by faith, was the Book\r\nof Homilies.[85]\r\n\r\nThey were tenacious, not only of all the doctrines of the Church of\r\nEngland, but of all her discipline, to the minutest points, and were\r\nscrupulously strict in observing the rubrics and canons. In short,\r\n“they were,” says Wesley, “in the strongest sense, high churchmen.”[86]\r\n\r\nMany of their proceedings were ecclesiastically irregular, though\r\nreligiously right; and Wesley, fearful of doing evil even while doing\r\ngood, wrote to his brother Samuel and to his father for advice. Samuel\r\nreplied that, though there might be some things concerning which he was\r\ndubious, yet he would choose to follow his two brothers to the grave\r\nrather than they should abandon their course of piety, and especially\r\nthat relating to the prisoners in the Castle.[87] The venerable rector,\r\nin his reply, said, “As to your designs and employments, what can I say\r\nless than _Valde probo_; and that I have the highest reason to bless\r\nGod that He has given me two sons together at Oxford, to whom He has\r\ngranted grace and courage to turn the war against the world and the\r\ndevil?” At the same time, however, he advised them to obtain consent\r\nto visit the prisoners from the chaplain, who had charge of them, and\r\nlikewise to seek the approbation of their bishop. This advice was\r\nadopted; the chaplain commended their design; and the bishop expressed\r\nhimself as highly pleased with their undertaking.[88]\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the year 1730, Wesley had the offer of a curacy,\r\neight miles from Oxford, for three or for six months, at the rate of\r\n£30 a year; and this he readily accepted, not only because it opened to\r\nhim a field of usefulness, but also because it enabled him to retain\r\nhis horse, when he began to feel that he must sell it; for if he had\r\nnot a horse of his own he must hire one to ride to his cure on Sundays,\r\nand the _hire_ would be quite as expensive as the _keep_.[89]\r\n\r\nIt was in the same year that he begun his remarkable correspondence\r\nwith Mary Granville, afterwards the celebrated wife and widow of the\r\nVery Rev. Dr. Delany, Dean of Down, in Ireland. Mary Granville, while\r\nliving in Gloucestershire, became acquainted with Sarah, daughter of\r\nthe Rev. Lionel Kirkham, of Staunton; and, ever after, the two ladies\r\nwere the most devoted friends.[90] We have already seen that Wesley was\r\na visitor of the Kirkhams; and that, in 1726, a warm-hearted intimacy\r\nexisted between him and one of the young ladies of that family, whose\r\npet name, among her friends, was “Varanese.” It is almost certain\r\nthat it was here Wesley was first introduced to the remarkable woman\r\nabove-mentioned. Their correspondence with each other was conducted\r\nin feigned names, Wesley calling himself “Cyrus,” and Mary Granville\r\ncalling herself “Aspasia,” that being the name by which she was often\r\ndesignated by her most intimate acquaintance.[91] The first letter from\r\n“Aspasia” is dated “August 28th, 1730.” She writes:—\r\n\r\n    “SIR,—I think myself extremely obliged to you for the favour of\r\n    the sermon and the letters. I received them safe last week, and\r\n    should sooner have made my acknowledgments for them, but that\r\n    I have been engaged with so much company since my return from\r\n    dear, delightful Staunton, that, till this moment, I have not\r\n    had time to express my gratitude for the elegant entertainment\r\n    I have had, not only from the manuscripts, but in recollecting\r\n    and repeating the conversation you and your brother made so\r\n    agreeable, which I hope will soon be renewed. If you have any\r\n    affairs that call you to Gloucester, don’t forget that you have\r\n    two pupils, who are desirous of improving their understanding;\r\n    and that friendship has already taught them to be, sir, your\r\n    most sincere, humble servants. My companion joins me in all I\r\n    have said, as well as in service to Araspes.”[92]\r\n\r\nThe companion referred to was probably Mary Granville’s mother (with\r\nwhom also Wesley corresponded),[93] or her beloved friend, Sarah\r\nKirkham. Araspes was most likely a feigned name for Wesley’s brother\r\nCharles. On the fly-leaf of the letter there is a postscript, in the\r\nhandwriting of Mary Granville’s sister, whose pet name was Selina,\r\ntelling Wesley that Aspasia was about to visit Bath, and that, if he\r\ndesigned to wait upon her, he had best write to her to ascertain her\r\nmovements. He is further told that “Varanese” (see Robert Kirkham’s\r\nletter, p. 50) had sent him a letter by the carrier about a fortnight\r\nago, and wished to know whether it had come safe to hand.\r\n\r\nMary Granville, at this period, was the widow of Alexander Pendarves,\r\nEsq., and was three years older than Wesley. As a member of the\r\nLansdowne family, she had moved in the most fashionable circles\r\nof London society, and was now a frequent attendant at ridottos,\r\nmasquerades, operas, and other amusements: but, in the midst of all,\r\nshe maintained an unblemished character; evinced talents and virtues of\r\nan exceedingly high order; was received at court during each successive\r\nreign; and, to the day of her death, was honoured with the notice and\r\nconfidence of George III. and his Queen Charlotte. Are we justified\r\nin inferring, from the language employed in the postscript of the\r\nabove letter, that Wesley was thinking of making Mary Granville (or\r\nrather Mrs. Pendarves) his wife? Or that there was some intrigue among\r\nhis friends, to bring about an interview at Bath, and to initiate a\r\ncorrespondence which might ripen into something more than an ordinary\r\nintimacy between friends? A correspondence was now begun which lasted\r\nfor four years, from August 1730 to July 1734. Mrs. Pendarves, however,\r\nremained in widowhood until 1743, when she married Dr. Delany. A few\r\nextracts, from some of Wesley’s letters to this distinguished lady, may\r\ncast some light upon the questions we have ventured to suggest, and\r\nwill also help to illustrate his character at this important period of\r\nhis history.\r\n\r\n    “_November 25, 1730._\r\n\r\n    “O that our friendship (since you give me leave to use that\r\n    dear word) may be built on a firm foundation. For want of\r\n    humility, I cannot follow you as I would. I must be left behind\r\n    in the race of virtue. I am sick of pride: it quite weighs my\r\n    spirit down. O, pray for me, that I may be healed. I have the\r\n    greater dependence on your intercession, because you know what\r\n    you ask. Every line of your last shows the heart of the writer,\r\n    where, with friendship, dwells humility. Ours, dear Aspasia,\r\n    it is to make acknowledgments; upon us lie the obligations of\r\n    gratitude. If it be a fault to have too harmonious a soul,\r\n    too exquisite a sense of elegant, generous transports, then,\r\n    indeed, I must own there is an obvious fault both in Selina\r\n    and Aspasia. If not, I fancy one may easily reconcile whatever\r\n    they think or act to the strictest reason; unless it be their\r\n    entertaining so favourable a thought of their most obliged and\r\n    most faithful—CYRUS.”\r\n\r\n    “_Innocents’ Day, 1730._\r\n\r\n    “Should one, who was as my own soul, be torn from me, it would\r\n    be best for me. Surely if you were called first, mine eyes\r\n    ought not to overflow because all tears were wiped away from\r\n    yours. But I much doubt whether self-love would not be found\r\n    too strong for a friendship, which I even now find to be less\r\n    disinterested than I hitherto imagined. Is it a fault to desire\r\n    to recommend myself to those who so strongly recommend virtue\r\n    to me? Tell me, Aspasia,—tell me, Selina,—if it be a fault that\r\n    my heart burns within me, when I reflect on the many marks of\r\n    regard you have already shown.”\r\n\r\nAspasia made an inquiry of Wesley, couched in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n    “Every Sunday evening, a gentleman in this town has a concert\r\n    of music. I am invited there to-night, and design to go. I\r\n    charge you, on the friendship you have professed for me, to\r\n    tell me your sincere opinion about it, and all your objections.\r\n    For, if I am in error by going, you ought to prevent my doing\r\n    so again.”\r\n\r\nWesley replied:—\r\n\r\n    “Far be it from me to think that any circumstance of life\r\n    shall ever give the enemy an advantage over Aspasia. He, who\r\n    has overcome the world and its princes, shall give His angels\r\n    charge over her to keep her in all her ways.\r\n\r\n    “To judge whether any action be lawful on the sabbath or no,\r\n    we are to consider whether it advances the end for which the\r\n    sabbath was ordained. Now, the end for which the sabbath was\r\n    ordained is the attainment of holiness. Whatever, therefore,\r\n    tends to advance this end is lawful on this day. Whatever does\r\n    not tend to advance this end is not lawful on this day.”\r\n\r\nMary Granville spent the summer of 1731 principally in London, and, to\r\na great extent, in the family of Richard Colley, Esq., who, three years\r\nbefore, had succeeded to the estates of his cousin Garrett Wesley,\r\nEsq., of the county of Meath, and had assumed the name and arms of\r\nWesley, and who, in 1746, was created Baron of Mornington. One day\r\nwould be spent in boating upon the Thames, the Duchess of Ancaster\r\naffording them high amusement by singing, or rather catterwauling,\r\na piece out of the “Beggars’ Opera”; the next day in witnessing the\r\nworking of her friend Wesley’s orrery, and in representing Lady\r\nShelburn at the baptism of a baby; another day in a jaunt to Greenwich.\r\nThen we find her attending court; and then sitting by the side of\r\nHogarth, while painting a picture of the Wesley family, and obtaining a\r\npromise that he would give her instructions in drawing. In the midst of\r\nall this fashionable, fluttering kind of life, John Wesley, at Oxford,\r\nwas writing her frequent letters.\r\n\r\nUnder the date of June 19, he says:—\r\n\r\n    “If Providence has used me as an instrument of doing any good\r\n    to Aspasia, I had almost said, ‘I have my reward.’ The thought\r\n    of having added anything to your ease will make many of my\r\n    hours the happier. I am extremely glad to find you among those\r\n    few who are yet concerned for the honour of their Master; and\r\n    cannot but congratulate you upon your wise choice. ‘If we\r\n    suffer with Him, we shall also reign with Him,’”\r\n\r\nA month later, he writes:—\r\n\r\n    “I have been charged with being _too strict_; with carrying\r\n    things too far in religion, and laying burdens upon myself,\r\n    if not on others, which are neither necessary nor possible\r\n    to be borne. Do not blame me, Aspasia, for using every means\r\n    to find whether I am thus guilty or no; and particularly for\r\n    appealing to the judgment of one who, in this, is not likely\r\n    to be prejudiced in my favour. Those among whom your lot is\r\n    chiefly cast are not accused of too much strictness. Whatever\r\n    other ill weeds may flourish there, a court is not a fit soil\r\n    for these. Give me leave, then, to lay freely before you what\r\n    my sentiments in this point are, and to conjure you to tell me\r\n    which of them you disapprove.”\r\n\r\nBy return of post, on July 21, Aspasia answers:—\r\n\r\n    “The imputation thrown upon you is a most extraordinary one.\r\n    But such is the temper of the world, when you have no vice to\r\n    feed their spleen with, they will condemn the highest virtue.\r\n    O Cyrus, how noble a defence you make! and how are you adorned\r\n    with the beauty of holiness! You really are in a state to be\r\n    envied. How ardently do I wish to be as resigned and humble\r\n    as yourself. As you say, my lot is fallen among those who\r\n    cannot be accused of too much strictness in religion; so far\r\n    from that, they generally make an open profession of having no\r\n    religion at all; and I cannot observe my fellow-creatures in\r\n    such manifest danger without feeling an inexpressible concern.”\r\n\r\nThree days later, on July 24, Wesley writes:—\r\n\r\n    “I am extremely happy in having your approbation, where I am\r\n    most careful to be approved. Give me the censure of the many,\r\n    the praise of the few. I have all the advantages that outward\r\n    circumstances can afford. _I_ spend, day by day, many hours\r\n    in those employments that have a direct tendency to improve\r\n    me. _You_ can rarely have one, wherein to pursue that great\r\n    work with the full bent of your mind. _I_ have scarce any\r\n    acquaintance in the world, who is not either apt to teach or\r\n    willing to learn. _You_ are entangled among several who can\r\n    plead for themselves little more than that they do no hurt. And\r\n    would to God even that plea would hold! I much fear it will\r\n    not. Is it no hurt to rob you of your time, for which there is\r\n    no equivalent but eternity? Must Aspasia ever submit to this\r\n    insupportable misfortune? Every time a gay wretch wants to\r\n    trifle away a part of that invaluable treasure which God has\r\n    lent him, shall he force away also a part of hers? Surely there\r\n    is a way to escape. The God whom you serve point it out to\r\n    you!”[94]\r\n\r\nAspasia, in other words Mrs. Delany, spent the winter of 1731 in\r\nIreland. On the 11th of March, 1732, writing to her sister from Dublin,\r\nshe says:—\r\n\r\n    “Cyrus, by this time, has blotted me out of his memory, or,\r\n    if he does remember me, it can only be to reproach me. What\r\n    can I say for myself, in having neglected so extraordinary a\r\n    correspondent? I only am the sufferer, but I should be very\r\n    sorry to have him think my silence proceeded from negligence. I\r\n    declare it is want of time.”[95]\r\n\r\nTwelve months after this, while still in Ireland, in another letter to\r\nher sister, she remarks:—\r\n\r\n    “As for the ridicule Cyrus has been exposed to, I do not at all\r\n    wonder at it. Religion, in its plainest dress, suffers daily\r\n    from the insolence and ignorance of the world; then how should\r\n    that person escape, who dares to appear openly in its cause? He\r\n    will meet with all the mortifications such rebels are able to\r\n    give, which can be no other than that of finding them wilfully\r\n    blinding themselves, and running headlong into the gulf of\r\n    perdition; a melancholy prospect for the honest-hearted man who\r\n    earnestly desires the salvation of his fellow-creatures.”[96]\r\n\r\nHere we close these specimens of correspondence. How are they to be\r\ninterpreted? When begun, John Wesley was a young man, twenty-seven\r\nyears of age, a fellow and tutor of a college, profoundly pious, and\r\nthe leader of the Oxford Methodists. His fair correspondent was a\r\nyoung widow, only three years older than himself, the niece of Lord\r\nLansdowne, opulent, talented, accomplished, beautiful, a favourite at\r\ncourt, and an intimate friend of the gentleman who had succeeded to\r\nthe estates of Garrett Wesley, who had wished to make Wesley’s brother\r\nCharles his heir.[97] Did Wesley correspond with Aspasia merely for the\r\nimprovement of himself in piety and knowledge? And did she correspond\r\nwith Wesley merely because she sympathised with the principles and\r\npractices of the Oxford Methodists? To say the least, this is extremely\r\ndoubtful. Mary Granville was a talented and accomplished woman, but,\r\nin that respect, Wesley was greatly her superior. She was moral,\r\nand, upon the whole, religious; but her life, among her aristocratic\r\nfriends, was fluttering and empty when compared with the intensely\r\nreligious life of Wesley and his friends at Oxford. The correspondence\r\nis a puzzle. There is nothing that is sickly or merely sentimental;\r\nbut, on both sides, there is an endearment which perplexes. Was Wesley\r\nenamoured? And was he groping his way to something else than ordinary\r\nfriendship? Did Mary Granville experience a reciprocity of feeling? And\r\nwas the reproach, which began to be heaped upon the Oxford Methodists,\r\nthe means of quenching it? We know not. But, supposing such conjectures\r\nto be true, what then? Was Wesley inconsistent with his principles, or\r\nunpardonably ambitious in longing for such an alliance? Or did Mary\r\nGranville at all demean herself in reciprocating Wesley’s feelings?\r\nWe think otherwise. Mary Granville ultimately married Patrick Delany,\r\nwho, except that he had become rich by already marrying a wealthy\r\nwidow, was, in no respect, the superior of John Wesley; and, in point\r\nof birth, was greatly his inferior; for, while the one was a son of an\r\neminently learned clergyman of the Established Church, the other was\r\nthe son of a servant to an Irish judge. The suspicions above mentioned\r\nare reasonable, though perhaps not true; and they naturally lead the\r\ncontemplative reader to inquire, if Cyrus had married Aspasia, would\r\nOxford Methodism have grown into what it afterwards became? If, to use\r\nWesley’s words, Charles Wesley had “a fair escape” when he declined to\r\nbecome Garrett Wesley’s heir, had not Wesley himself “a fair escape”\r\nwhen his letters to the intimate friend of Garrett Wesley’s successor\r\nended as they did?\r\n\r\nThis is an episode. We return to the Methodism of the Oxford Methodists.\r\n\r\nIn 1731, Wesley and his brother began the practice of conversing with\r\neach other in Latin when by themselves, and this they continued to the\r\nend of life. In the same year, a meeting was held by several of the\r\nsenior graduates, to consult on the readiest way to stop the progress\r\nof the Methodist movement; and it was soon publicly reported that the\r\ncensors were about to blow up the _Godly Club_. In April, Wesley,\r\naccompanied by his brother, set out on foot for Epworth; and, after\r\na three weeks’ visit walked the same distance back, having made two\r\ndiscoveries: 1. That four or five and twenty miles is an easy and safe\r\nday’s journey in hot weather as well as cold; and, 2. That it was easy\r\nto read as they walked, for a distance of ten or a dozen miles, without\r\nfeeling either faint or weary. By this lengthened pedestrian tour they\r\nhad been freed from all superfluous humours, and were not now in the\r\nslightest danger of an attack of gout. During their brief absence,\r\nhowever, their “little company” had “shrunk into almost none at all;\r\nfor Mr. Morgan was sick at Holt; Mr. Boyce at his father’s house at\r\nBarton; Mr. Kirkham was about to leave to become his uncle’s curate;\r\nand another young gentleman of Christ Church had returned to the ways\r\nof the world, and studiously shunned their company.”[98]\r\n\r\nIn August, Wesley, writing to one of his pupils, says:—\r\n\r\n    “You, who have not the assurance of a day to live, are not\r\n    wise if you waste a moment. The shortest way to knowledge\r\n    seems to be this: 1. To ascertain what knowledge you desire\r\n    to attain. 2. To read no book which does not in some way tend\r\n    to the attainment of that knowledge. 3. To read no book which\r\n    does tend to the attainment of it, unless it be the best in\r\n    its kind. 4. To finish one before you begin another. 5. To\r\n    read them all in such order, that every subsequent book may\r\n    illustrate and confirm the preceding.”[99]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Wesley had begun observing the Wednesday and Friday\r\nfasts, commonly observed in the ancient church, tasting no food\r\nwhatever till three in the afternoon. Some of his friends had left\r\nhim; but he still diligently strove against all kinds of sin; omitted\r\nno sort of self-denial which he thought lawful; carefully used, both\r\nin public and in private, all the means of grace; and embraced every\r\nopportunity of doing good.[100]\r\n\r\nIn 1732, he wrote a sermon on the sacrament of the Lord’s supper, for\r\nthe use of his pupils, in which he shows the duty of all Christians\r\nto communicate as often as they can. He asserts that, with “the\r\nfirst Christians, the Christian sacrifice was a constant part of the\r\nLord’s day service; and that, for several centuries, they received\r\nit almost daily; four days a week always, and every saint’s day\r\nbeside.” He further asserts that the Church of England has taken “all\r\npossible care that the sacrament be duly administered, wherever the\r\nCommon-Prayer is read, every Sunday and holiday in the year;” and that\r\nthose who do not receive it, at least thrice in a year, are liable to\r\nexcommunication.[101]\r\n\r\nIn the same month (February) in which Wesley wrote his sermon, his\r\nmother addressed to him a letter from which we extract the following:—\r\n\r\n    “The young gentleman you mention seems to me to be in the right\r\n    concerning the real presence of Christ in the sacrament. I\r\n    own, I never understood by the _real presence_ more than what\r\n    he has elegantly expressed, that ‘the Divine nature of Christ\r\n    is then eminently present, to impart, by the operation of His\r\n    Spirit, the benefits of His death to worthy receivers,’ And\r\n    surely, the Divine presence of our Lord, thus applying the\r\n    virtue and merits of the great atonement to each true believer,\r\n    makes the consecrated bread more than a sign of Christ’s body;\r\n    since, by His so doing, we receive not only the sign, but with\r\n    it the thing signified—all the benefits of His incarnation and\r\n    passion. But still, however this Divine institution may seem to\r\n    others, to me it is full of mystery.”[102]\r\n\r\nTo this Wesley replied as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “_February 28, 1732._\r\n\r\n    “One consideration is enough to make me assent to your judgment\r\n    concerning the holy sacrament; which is, that we cannot allow\r\n    Christ’s human nature to be present in it, without allowing\r\n    either con- or trans-substantiation. But that His Divinity is\r\n    so united to us then, as He never is but to worthy receivers,\r\n    I firmly believe, though the manner of that union is utterly a\r\n    mystery to me.”[103]\r\n\r\nSuch was the sacramentarian theory of the high church Oxford Methodists\r\nin 1732.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter, Wesley introduces another subject, showing that,\r\nafter all, his earnest piety was not unmixed with morbidness. He\r\ncontinues:—\r\n\r\n    “To all who give signs of their not being strangers to the mind\r\n    of Christ, I propose this question,—and why not to you rather\r\n    than any? shall I quite break off my pursuit of all learning\r\n    but what immediately tends to practice? I once desired to\r\n    make a fair show in language and philosophy; but it is past;\r\n    there is a more excellent way; and, if I cannot attain to any\r\n    progress in the one, without throwing up all thoughts of the\r\n    other, why, fare it well! Yet a little while, and we shall all\r\n    be equal in knowledge, if we are in virtue.”\r\n\r\nThis was simply silly and absurd; for, on the same principle, a man\r\nought to give up business, because business does not “immediately tend\r\nto the practice of piety.”\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated that, during Wesley’s brief visit to\r\nEpworth, in 1731, the Oxford Methodists were greatly scattered. In\r\nthe spring of 1732, their forces were recruited by the adhesion of\r\nMr. Clayton, and Mr. Broughton, and half-a-dozen pupils belonging to\r\nhimself, his brother, and Mr. Clayton. Six evenings every week were\r\nspent, from six to nine o’clock, partly in reading and considering the\r\nGreek Testament, and partly in close conversation.[104]\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, Wesley, being in London, paid a visit to the\r\nRev. William Law, at Putney, and commenced a friendship which lasted\r\nfor several years. From this period, he began to read the “Theologia\r\nGermanica,” and other mystic writings, with what results will be seen\r\nhereafter. On the 3rd of August, he was made a member of “The Society\r\nfor the Propagation of Christian Knowledge;” and, during his stay in\r\nLondon, received from Mr. Clayton a long letter, which will help to\r\ngive the reader an insight into the difficulties and daily life of\r\nthe Oxford Methodists. It was first published in the _Wesleyan Times_\r\nnewspaper, of September 24, 1866.\r\n\r\n    “OXON, _August 1, 1732_.\r\n\r\n    “REV. AND DEAR SIR,—I cannot but think it an extraordinary\r\n    providence, that, when we had lost our best advocate and\r\n    patron, all opposition against us should immediately cease.\r\n    Since you left us, nobody has thought it worth while to attack\r\n    either Mr. Smith or me, or to endeavour to remove us from those\r\n    principles wherein you, by the grace of God, have fixed us. Mr.\r\n    Smith goes out of town to-morrow, and so will be entirely out\r\n    of danger from the fellows of Lincoln. He seems to be forearmed\r\n    against the temptations which may possibly arise from strange\r\n    company and from travelling. My little flock at Brazenose are,\r\n    God be praised, true to their principles. Bocardo,” [a room\r\n    over the north gate of the city used as a debtors’ prison,]\r\n    “I fear, grows worse upon my hands: they have done nothing\r\n    but quarrel ever since you left us. They carried matters so\r\n    high on Saturday, that the bailiff was sent for, who ordered\r\n    Tomlyn to be fettered, and put into the dungeon. The Castle\r\n    is, I thank God! in much better condition. All the felons were\r\n    acquitted, except Salmon, who is to be tried at Warwick; and\r\n    the sheep-stealer, who is burnt in the hand and is a great\r\n    penitent. Jempro is discharged, and I have appointed Harris to\r\n    read to the prisoners in his stead. Two of the felons likewise\r\n    have paid their fees and are gone out, both of them able to\r\n    read mighty well. There are only two in the gaol who want this\r\n    accomplishment,—John Clanville, who reads but moderately, and\r\n    the horse-stealer who cannot read at all, though he knows all\r\n    his letters and can spell most of the monosyllables. I hear\r\n    them both read three times a week; and, I believe, Salmon\r\n    hears them so many times daily. The woman, who was a perfect\r\n    novice, spells tolerably; and so does one of the boys; and\r\n    the other makes shift to read with spelling every word that\r\n    is longer than ordinary. They can both say their catechism\r\n    to the end of the commandments, and can likewise repeat the\r\n    morning and evening prayers for children in Ken’s Manual. I\r\n    have been twice at the school, namely, on Tuesday and Saturday\r\n    last; and intend to go again as soon as I have finished this\r\n    letter. The children all go on pretty well, except one, who,\r\n    I find, truants till eleven o’clock in a morning. I have\r\n    obtained leave to go to St. Thomas’s workhouse twice a week. I\r\n    am sure the people much need instruction, for there is hardly\r\n    a soul can read in the whole house. Pray, do not forget a few\r\n    Common-Prayer Books for the Castle.\r\n\r\n    “You cannot imagine the pleasure it is for me to know that you\r\n    are engaged every morning in prayer for me. I wish for nine\r\n    o’clock more eagerly than ever I did before; and, I think, I\r\n    begin to perceive what is meant by that union of souls which\r\n    is so much talked of in Pere Malebranche and Madam Bourignon.\r\n    Mr. Hall is not yet come home; so that I am pretty much taken\r\n    up with the poor people and the prisoners. I thank God, I\r\n    have fully conquered my affection for a morning nap, and rise\r\n    constantly by five o’clock, and have the pleasure to see\r\n    myself imitated by the greatest part of my pupils. I have made\r\n    Mr. Clements a proselyte to early rising, though I cannot to\r\n    constant communion. May God prosper all your designs of doing\r\n    good in London.\r\n\r\n    “I am, Rev. and dear Sir,\r\n    “Your affectionate friend and obedient humble servant,\r\n\r\n    “J. CLAYTON.”\r\n\r\nThe lull in the opposition to the Oxford Methodists was of short\r\ncontinuance. A month after the date of Mr. Clayton’s letter, Wesley had\r\nto mourn the death of his friend Morgan, and to defend himself against\r\nthe accusation that Morgan had hastened his death by the rigorous\r\nfasting, which he had practised at Wesley’s recommendation.[105]\r\nWesley’s long letter fully satisfied Morgan’s father, who expressed\r\nhimself as almost wishing to be one of the Oxford Methodists himself,\r\nand as ready to vindicate them from any calumny or aspersion that might\r\nbe cast upon them.[106] There were others, however, of a different\r\nmind, for a fortnight after Mr. Morgan wrote thus to Wesley, an article\r\nappeared in _Fogg’s Weekly Journal_, to the effect that there were,\r\nin the Oxford University, a number of persons who, in order “to live\r\nup to the principles of Christianity had doomed themselves to absurd\r\nand perpetual melancholy;” and that “these sons of sorrow designed\r\nto make the whole place a monastery.” The writer continues: “These\r\nMethodists pretend to great refinements, as well as to what regards\r\nthe speculative, as the practical part of religion; and have a very\r\nnear affinity to the Essenes among the Jews, and the Pietists in\r\nSwitzerland. The chief hinge, on which their whole scheme of religion\r\nturns, is, that no action whatever is indifferent; and hence they\r\ncondemn several actions as bad, which are not only allowed to be\r\ninnocent, but laudable, by the rest of mankind. They avoid, as much\r\nas possible, every object that may affect them with any pleasant or\r\ngrateful sensations. All social entertainments and diversions are\r\ndisapproved of; and, in endeavouring to avoid luxury, they not only\r\nexclude what is convenient, but what is absolutely necessary for the\r\nsupport of life; fancying, (as is thought,) that religion was designed\r\nto contradict nature. They neglect and voluntarily afflict their\r\nbodies, and practise several rigorous and superstitious customs, which\r\nGod never required of them. All Wednesdays and Fridays are strictly\r\nto be kept as fasts; and blood let once a fortnight, to keep down the\r\ncarnal man. At dinner, they sigh for the time they are obliged to spend\r\nin eating. Every morning to rise at four o’clock, is supposed a duty;\r\nand to employ two hours a day in singing of psalms and hymns, is judged\r\nan indispensable requisite to being a Christian. In short, they\r\npractise everything contrary to the judgment of other persons, and\r\nallow none to have any (religion) but those of their own sect, which is\r\nthe farthest from it.\r\n\r\n“As these Methodists have occasioned no small stir in Oxford, so there\r\nhas not been wanting a variety of conjectures about them. Some are\r\napt to ascribe their gloomy and disconsolate way of life to want of\r\nmoney; thus being denied the enjoyment of those pleasures they chiefly\r\ndesire, they are weighed down by an habitual sorrow; and it is certain\r\nthat their founder took formerly no small liberty in indulging his\r\nappetites. Others tax their characters with hypocrisy, and suppose them\r\nto use religion only as a veil to vice; and, indeed, if we should give\r\ncredit to the several tales related of them, their greatest friends\r\nwould be ashamed to stand in their defence. Others judge that their way\r\nof life is owing to enthusiasm, madness, and superstitious scruples.\r\nAmong their own party, they pass for religious persons, and men of\r\nextraordinary parts; but they have the misfortune to be taken by all,\r\nwho have ever been in their company, for madmen and fools.”\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the scandalous charges contained in this precious\r\nepistolary morsel,—we believe the first attack ever made upon the\r\nMethodists in the public prints. The entire letter is before us; but\r\nonly a part of it is quoted,—first because there is a great amount of\r\nempty and ungrammatical verbiage unworthy of being admitted into what\r\nwas, at that period, perhaps the most literary and respectable paper\r\npublished—_Fogg’s Weekly Journal_; and secondly because there is one\r\nparagraph, which, despite its verbosity, is so loathsomely impure, that\r\nit would be a sin against both God and man to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nThe letter was published in _Fogg’s Journal_, on December 9th, 1732;\r\nand, within two months after, it was answered in an octavo pamphlet of\r\nthirty pages, entitled, “The Oxford Methodists: Being some account of a\r\nsociety of young gentlemen in that city, so denominated; setting forth\r\ntheir rise, views, and designs; in a letter from a gent, near Oxford,\r\nto his friend in London. Printed for J. Roberts, price 6_d._” The\r\nsecond edition of this first defence of Methodism, published in 1738\r\n“with very great alterations and improvements,” is that from which the\r\nfollowing extracts are taken.\r\n\r\nThe writer says that he knew nothing of the Methodists till his friend\r\nrequested him to make inquiry concerning them. On doing this, he was\r\nfirst of all told that they were “miserable enthusiasts and zealots;”\r\nand he found that almost every one, with whom he conversed, had a\r\nprejudice against them; and yet, notwithstanding this, he was unable\r\nto learn that the least slur had been cast upon their moral behaviour,\r\nexcept that “they pretended to be more pious than their neighbours,”\r\nand that “they put a gloomy and melancholy face upon religion, and\r\naffected greater austerities and exemplariness than the doctrines of\r\nthe gospel demanded.”\r\n\r\nThe writer continues; after he “had heard all that could be said\r\nagainst them by their enemies,” he “thought it was but fair to inquire\r\nof their friends what could be said in their favour.” He found it,\r\nhowever, difficult to meet with any who would acknowledge himself to be\r\na friend; and hence he was obliged to seek his information from one of\r\nthe Methodists themselves. It is probable that Wesley was the Methodist\r\nthus consulted; but, be that as it may, a full account was given of the\r\norigin of Methodism at the end of the year 1729, and of its progress\r\nto the present time. The writer adds: “The gentleman assured me, that\r\nthey” (the Methodists) “were so diffident of themselves, especially\r\nwhen they found a spirit of contemptuous raillery stirred up against\r\nthem, that they took advice from time to time of a worthy and venerable\r\ngentleman, a near relation of one of them, who had much knowledge and\r\nexperience of the world; and that they formed their conduct upon his\r\nadvice; and, upon the encouragement he gave them, they were determined,\r\nat all events, to persevere in the course they had begun.”\r\n\r\nThe “near relation,” referred to in this extract, was Wesley’s father;\r\nand the extract is of vast importance as tending to confirm the\r\nopinion that the “father of the Wesleys”—the noble-hearted rector of\r\nEpworth—deserves more credit for the organisation and establishment\r\nof Oxford Methodism than the Methodists and the Church have ever yet\r\nawarded him. Several of his “encouraging epistles” were shown to the\r\ninquiring writer of the pamphlet before us, and gave him “a high\r\nnotion of the piety and good sense of the venerable author.” “How\r\nhappy,” he writes, “are these sacramentarians, these Methodists, these\r\nenthusiasts, as their enemies call them, to have so very excellent a\r\ndirector! and how much are they to be commended for submitting their\r\nconduct and designs to so pious and experienced a judge.”\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds: “There are three points to which these gentlemen\r\nthink themselves obliged to adhere—1. That of visiting and relieving\r\nthe prisoners and the sick, and giving away Bibles, Common-Prayer\r\nBooks, and the ‘Whole Duty of Man’; and of explaining the catechism to\r\nthe children of poor families, and of dropping a shilling or so to such\r\nfamilies where they deem it needful. 2. That of weekly communion. 3.\r\nThat of observing strictly the fasts of the Church, which has caused\r\nsome to call them ‘Supererogation Men.’”\r\n\r\nAfter this, the writer proceeds to notice the accusations contained\r\nin the letter published in _Fogg’s Weekly Journal_, and, as far as\r\nnecessary, replies to them.\r\n\r\nSuch is an outline of the first defence of Methodism ever published.\r\n\r\nWesley, in 1733, composed two sermons full of a great doctrine, which\r\nhad well-nigh been forgotten—the absolute need of the influences of\r\nthe Holy Ghost to convert the soul. It is a gross mistake to imagine\r\nthat this, with its cognate truths, was not discovered and embraced by\r\nWesley until his meeting with Peter Bohler in 1738. Take the following\r\nextracts from the first of the sermons above mentioned, and which was\r\npreached at St. Mary’s, Oxford, before the university, on January 1st,\r\n1733.[107]\r\n\r\n“The circumcision of the heart is that habitual disposition of soul,\r\nwhich, in the sacred writings, is termed holiness; and which directly\r\nimplies the being cleansed from sin, from all filthiness both of flesh\r\nand spirit; and, by consequence, the being endued with those virtues\r\nwhich were also in Christ Jesus; the being so renewed in the image of\r\nour mind, as to be perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect.”\r\n\r\nHere we have propounded, in the plainest terms, as early as the year\r\n1733, Wesley’s famous doctrine of Christian perfection. “This sermon,”\r\nsaid he, in 1765, “contained all that I now teach concerning salvation\r\nfrom all sin, and loving God with an undivided heart.”[108]\r\n\r\nIn the same sermon he tells us that, “without the Spirit of God we\r\ncan do nothing but add sin to sin; it being as impossible for us even\r\nto think a good thought without His supernatural assistance, as to\r\ncreate ourselves, or to renew our whole souls in righteousness and true\r\nholiness. He alone can quicken those who are dead unto God, and breathe\r\ninto them the breath of Christian life.”\r\n\r\nWe are further taught that this holiness of heart is to be obtained\r\n“alone by faith, which is not only an unshaken assent to all that\r\nGod hath revealed in Scripture, but in particular to those important\r\ntruths,—‘Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners,’—‘He bare\r\nour sins in His own body on the tree,’—‘He is the propitiation for our\r\nsins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.’”\r\n\r\nThen follows: “Those who are thus, by faith, born of God, have also\r\nstrong consolation through hope. This is the next thing which the\r\ncircumcision of the heart implies; even the testimony of their own\r\nspirit, with the Spirit which witnesses in their hearts, that they are\r\nthe children of God.”\r\n\r\nThen, as if intended to answer one of the false accusations which had\r\nappeared in _Fogg’s Weekly Journal_ only three weeks before, and to\r\njustify one of the practices there condemned, he tells his reverend\r\nand learned auditors that this heart religion “does not forbid us, as\r\nsome have strangely imagined, to take pleasure in anything but God;\r\nto suppose this, is to suppose the Fountain of holiness is directly\r\nthe author of sin; since He has inseparably annexed pleasure to the\r\nuse of those creatures which are necessary to sustain the life He has\r\ngiven us.” But, at the same time, “every good soldier of Christ will\r\nnot only renounce the works of darkness, but every appetite too, and\r\nevery affection, which is not subject to the law of God. Vain hope!\r\nthat a child of Adam should ever expect to see the kingdom of Christ\r\nand of God, without striving, without agonizing first, to enter in at\r\nthe strait gate,—without a constant and continued course of general\r\nself-denial.”\r\n\r\n“This,” adds Wesley, “is God’s short and plain account of true religion\r\nand virtue. Other sacrifices from us He would not; but the living\r\nsacrifice of the heart He hath chosen. Let it be continually offered\r\nup to God through Christ, in flames of holy love. And let no creature\r\nbe suffered to share with Him; for He is a jealous God. His throne\r\nwill He not divide with another; He will reign without a rival. Be no\r\ndesign, no desire admitted there, but what has Him for its ultimate\r\nobject. This is the way wherein those children of God once walked, who,\r\nbeing dead, still speak to us.”[109]\r\n\r\nSuch then were the principles held by Wesley and the Oxford Methodists,\r\nin 1733. From these he never varied; and dark will be the day when they\r\nare either abandoned or forgotten by his followers.\r\n\r\nThe other sermon, written in 1733, was founded upon the text, “Grieve\r\nnot the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of\r\nredemption.” Here again we are told that the Holy Spirit “is the great\r\nFountain of holiness to His church. From Him flows all the grace and\r\nvirtue, by which the stains of guilt are cleansed, and we are renewed\r\nin all holy dispositions, and again bear the image of our Creator. He\r\nis the immediate Minister of God’s will upon earth, and transacts all\r\nthe great affairs of the church of Christ.”[110]\r\n\r\nPrecious truths are truths like these. Without them the church, no\r\nmatter how learned, rich, respectable, and ritualistic, is utterly\r\npowerless in converting men. With them, nothing is impossible; for, in\r\nsuch a case, the church has, for the accomplishment of its purposes,\r\nnot only the resources of man, but the omnipotence of God.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1733, Wesley issued his first printed production, “A\r\nCollection of Forms of Prayer for every day in the Week.” These prayers\r\nwere originally intended for the use of his college pupils; but the\r\nreader may also gather from them some of the principles and aims of the\r\nOxford Methodists.\r\n\r\nThey longed for the love of God to be the sole actuating power in the\r\nuse they made of their understanding, affections, senses, health, time,\r\nand talents; that God might always be present to their minds; that they\r\nmight ever have awful thoughts of Him, and never mention His holy and\r\nreverend name, unless on just, solemn, and devout occasions; nor even\r\nthen, without acts of adoration; and that they might glorify Him by\r\nevery thought of their hearts, every word of their tongues, and every\r\nwork of their hands, and by professing His truth, even to the death, if\r\nit should please Him to call them to it.\r\n\r\nThey wished to be made all kindness and benignity, all goodness and\r\ngentleness, all meekness and longsuffering; and to be filled with the\r\nwhole spirit of humility, and to have it the constant, ruling habit\r\nof their minds. They dreaded applause, and desired never to speak a\r\nword that might tend to their own praise, unless the good of others\r\nrequired it. They endeavoured to abstain from all pleasures which did\r\nnot prepare them for taking pleasure in God.\r\n\r\nThey acted upon the principle of excluding none from their charity,\r\nwho were the objects of God’s mercy. They embraced all occasions to\r\nassist the needy, to protect the oppressed, to instruct the ignorant,\r\nto confirm the wavering, to exhort the good, and to reprove the wicked.\r\nThey wished to look upon the failings of their neighbours as if they\r\nwere their own; and never revealed them but when charity required, and\r\nthen with tenderness and compassion.\r\n\r\nSpace forbids further reference to these prayers. Suffice it to say\r\nthat, for reverential feeling, simplicity and beauty of expression,\r\nscriptural sentiment, Christian benevolence, and earnest longings for\r\nthe highest holiness; for adoration, penitence, deprecation, petition,\r\nthanksgiving, and intercession,—they have no superiors, perhaps hardly\r\nany equals, in the English language. They are little known, and less\r\nused; but would be of great service to thousands of Methodists, if\r\nsometimes employed as an aid in their private devotions.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1733, Wesley set out on horseback for Epworth, to see his\r\nfather, whose health was failing; and, on his way, had a narrow escape,\r\nby his horse falling over a bridge, not far from Daventry. His parents\r\nsuggested to him the propriety of using means to obtain the Epworth\r\nliving; but he was deterred from acquiescing in the proposal, by a\r\nconviction that, “if he could stand his ground at Oxford, and approve\r\nhimself a faithful minister of Christ, through evil report and good\r\nreport, there was no place under heaven where he was so likely to make\r\nimprovement in every good work.”[111]\r\n\r\nIn May, he again went to Epworth, visiting, on the way, his friend\r\nClayton, at Manchester, where he spent a sabbath, and preached thrice,\r\nin three different churches. On his return to Oxford, in June, he\r\nfound the ill effects of his absence; for three of his own pupils and\r\nthe whole of Mr. Clayton’s had abandoned the Methodists; and, instead\r\nof finding seven-and-twenty communicants at St. Mary’s, he now found\r\nnot more than five. His friends were deserting him, and his enemies\r\ntriumphing over him; but, in the midst of all, he stood unmoved. “My\r\nfriends,” says he, “were either trifling or serious: if triflers, fare\r\nthem well; a noble escape: if serious, those who are more serious are\r\nleft, whom the others would rather have opposed than forwarded in the\r\nservice they have done, and still do, us. As for reputation, though\r\nit be a glorious instrument of advancing our Master’s service, yet\r\nthere is a better than that—a clean heart, a single eye, a soul full\r\nof God.”[112] “The thing that gives offence here is the being singular\r\nwith regard to time, expense, and company. Ill men say all manner of\r\nevil of me, and good men believe them. There is a way, and there is\r\nbut one, of making my peace. God forbid I should ever take it. I have\r\nas many pupils as I need, and as many friends; when more are better\r\nfor me, I shall have more. If I have no more pupils after these are\r\ngone from me, I shall then be glad of a curacy near you; if I have, I\r\nshall take it as a signal to remain here. What I do is this; when I am\r\nentrusted with a person who is first to understand and practise, and\r\nthen to teach, the law of Christ, I endeavour to show him what that\r\nlaw is. When he appears seriously sensible of this, I propose to him\r\nthe means God hath commanded him to use, in order to that end; and a\r\nweek, or a month, or a year after, as the state of his soul seems to\r\nrequire it, the several prudential means recommended by wise and good\r\nmen. Only two rules it is my principle to observe in all cases; first,\r\nto begin, continue, and end all my advices in the spirit of meekness;\r\nand secondly, to add to meekness long suffering; in pursuance of a rule\r\nwhich I fixed long since, never to give up any one till I have tried\r\nhim at least ten years.”[113]\r\n\r\nThese are significant facts. Methodism at Oxford was organised in\r\n1729. Two years after, while Wesley and his brother were at Epworth,\r\nit dwindled into almost nothing; and two years later still, when it\r\nhad increased to seven-and-twenty communicants, during another brief\r\nEpworth visit it was almost utterly destroyed, for the seven-and-twenty\r\nwere reduced to five. All this goes to show that Wesley was the soul of\r\nthis mighty movement, and that without him it would have been dissolved\r\nand become extinct.\r\n\r\nIt is far from certain that the seven-and-twenty communicants, just\r\nmentioned, were all collegians. On the contrary, there is strong\r\npresumptive proof that they were not; and, indeed, that some of them\r\nwere ladies. One of them seems to have been Miss Potter, probably the\r\nbishop’s daughter, concerning whom Clayton writes to Wesley, in a\r\nletter dated “Manchester, September 10, 1733,” as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Poor Miss Potter! I wonder not that she is fallen. Where\r\n    humility is not the foundation, the superstructure cannot be\r\n    good. And yet I am sorry to hear the tidings of her, especially\r\n    that she has a great man for her confessor, who dissuades her\r\n    from constant communion. I am sure she has great occasion to\r\n    use all the means of grace which Providence provides for her.\r\n    I would not persuade you to leave off reading with her. Who\r\n    knows whether you may not raise her again to the eminence\r\n    from which she has fallen? At least, though she neglect the\r\n    weightier matters of the law, yet keep up in her that reverend\r\n    respect she bears it, even by the ‘tithing of mint and anise\r\n    and cummin.’”[114]\r\n\r\nWhether there were other ladies besides this one, included in the\r\nseven-and-twenty Methodist communicants, it is impossible to say; but\r\nnone were included in the five. The five poor Methodists remaining,\r\nnot reckoning Wesley himself, nor Morgan who was dead, nor Clayton who\r\nwas removed to Manchester, nor Whitelamb who was gone to Wroote, were\r\ndoubtless Charles Wesley, Benjamin Ingham[115] and James Hervey (both\r\nof whom joined them in 1733), John Gambold, and, probably, Charles\r\nKinchin. All honour to such names! They kept the fire burning when it\r\nwas in danger of going out. Wesley was their master spirit; but they\r\nwere faithful and willing co-workers.\r\n\r\nMr. Clayton, in the letter just quoted, refers to confession and to\r\nconstant communion. Did the Oxford Methodists recommend confession?\r\nIt would seem they did; hence the following extract from a long,\r\nunpublished letter, written at this period, and addressed to Wesley, by\r\nhis sister Emily:—\r\n\r\n    “To lay open the state of my soul to you, or any of our clergy,\r\n    is what I have no inclination to at present; and, I believe, I\r\n    never shall. I shall not put my conscience under the direction\r\n    of mortal man, frail as myself. To my own master I stand or\r\n    fall. Nay, I scruple not to say, that all such desire in you,\r\n    or any other ecclesiastic, seems to me like church tyranny, and\r\n    assuming to yourselves a dominion over your fellow-creatures,\r\n    which was never designed you by God.... I farther own that I do\r\n    not hold frequent communion necessary to salvation, nor a means\r\n    of Christian perfection. But do not mistake my meaning; I only\r\n    think communing every Sunday, or very frequently, lessens our\r\n    veneration for that sacred ordinance, and, consequently, our\r\n    profiting by it.”\r\n\r\nTwo other extracts from letters, belonging to this period, may be\r\nuseful as illustrative of Oxford Methodism. In the month of July, 1733,\r\nMr. Clayton, then resident in Manchester, wrote to Wesley as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “As to your question about Saturday, I can only answer it by\r\n    giving an account of how I spend the day. I do not look upon\r\n    it as a preparation for Sunday, but as a festival itself;\r\n    and, therefore, I have continued festival prayer, for the\r\n    three primitive hours, and for morning and evening, from the\r\n    Apostolical Constitutions, which, I think, I communicated\r\n    to you whilst I was at Oxford. I look upon Friday as my\r\n    preparation for the celebration of both the sabbath and the\r\n    Lord’s day; the first of which I observe much like a common\r\n    saint’s day, or as one of the inferior holidays of the Church.\r\n    I have, I bless God! generally contrived to have the eucharist\r\n    celebrated on Saturdays as well as other holidays, for the use\r\n    of myself and the sick people whom I visit.\r\n\r\n    “I was at Dr. Deacon’s when your letter came to hand, and we\r\n    had a deal of talk about your scheme of avowing yourselves as\r\n    a society, and fixing upon a set of rules. The Doctor seemed\r\n    to think you had better let it alone; for to what end would\r\n    it serve? It would be no additional tie upon yourselves; and\r\n    perhaps would be a snare for the consciences of those weak\r\n    brethren who might chance to come among you. Observing the\r\n    stations” [the fast on Wednesdays and Fridays] “and weekly\r\n    communion are duties which stand upon a much higher footing\r\n    than a rule of society; and they who can set aside the command\r\n    of God and the authority of the Church will hardly, I doubt, be\r\n    tied by the rules of a private society.\r\n\r\n    “As to the mixture” [of water with sacramental wine] “Mr.\r\n    Colley told me it was constantly used at Christ Church.\r\n    However, if you have reason to doubt it, I would have you\r\n    inquire; but I cannot think the want of it a reason for not\r\n    communicating. If I could receive where the mixture was used,\r\n    I would; and, therefore, I used to prefer the Castle to Christ\r\n    Church; but if not I should not think myself any further\r\n    concerned in the matter than as it might be in my power to get\r\n    it restored.”[116]\r\n\r\nAgain, in another letter, dated “Manchester, September 10, 1733,” Mr.\r\nClayton writes:—\r\n\r\n    “How should I direct my instructor in the school of Christ!\r\n    However, I must be free to tell you my sentiments of what\r\n    you inquire about. On Wednesdays and Fridays I have, for\r\n    some time past, used the Office for Passion Week, out of\r\n    Spinckes’s Devotions, and bless God for it. I have found it\r\n    very useful to excite in me that love of God, and that sorrow\r\n    for having offended Him, which make up the first main branch\r\n    of repentance. Refer your last question to Mr. Law; I dare not\r\n    give directions for spending that time which I consume in bed,\r\n    nor teach you, who rise at four, when I indulge myself in sleep\r\n    till five.”[117]\r\n\r\nThese are important letters, not only as exhibiting the religious\r\nearnestness of Wesley and his friends, but as affording a glimpse\r\nof the high churchism of the Oxford Methodists. Wesley seriously\r\ncontemplated the formation of a society, who should strictly observe\r\nsaint days, holidays, and Saturdays, besides other ritualistic\r\npractices, down to superstitious admixture of sacramental wine with\r\nwater. In truth, these were ardent spirits. Visiting prisons, and\r\nteaching children; rising at five every morning; praying for each\r\nother and for their friends; and observing the weekly communion, are\r\nthings which all will regard with commendation: but the other were\r\nsilly, popish practices, not only unauthorised and useless, but too\r\nmuch resembling the pernicious nonsense of the high church party of\r\nthe present day to receive the approval of those who have learned to\r\nbe thankful for the inestimable blessings of the great Protestant\r\nreformation.\r\n\r\nThe health of Wesley’s father was now extremely feeble; and it became\r\nan anxiously discussed family question whether Wesley should be his\r\nfather’s successor. Samuel was first urged to use means to obtain\r\nthe next presentation of the Epworth rectory; but he positively\r\ndeclined doing so, and directed his father’s attention to John. The\r\ncorrespondence on this subject extends over the whole of the year\r\n1734. The Epworth living was valuable, as may be judged by the fact\r\nthat, though then worth only £200 per annum, it is now, through the\r\nrelative changes that have taken place in the value of money and the\r\nprice of food, worth near £1000.[118] The dying rector had been at\r\ngreat expense in improving the parsonage and its premises. Here he had\r\ndiligently and faithfully laboured as an earnest parish minister for\r\nnearly forty successive years. Here most of his nineteen children had\r\nbeen born. Here he was about to die himself; and here he was anxious\r\nthat his wife should die. John was pressed to secure the living, and\r\nthereby secure a continuance of the old homestead for his mother and\r\nhis unmarried sisters. His brother Samuel allowed that at Oxford he\r\nwould have “more friends, more freedom from care, and more Divine\r\nordinances than he could have elsewhere;” but then at Oxford he was\r\n“despised,” and therefore could “do no good there.” To this John\r\nanswered: “1. A Christian will be despised anywhere. 2. No one is a\r\nChristian till he is despised. 3. His being despised will not hinder\r\nhis doing good, but much further it, by making him a better Christian.\r\n4. Another can supply my place at Epworth better than at Oxford, and\r\nthe good done here is of a far more diffusive nature; inasmuch as it is\r\na more extensive benefit to sweeten the fountain than to do the same to\r\nparticular streams.”[119]\r\n\r\nIn writing to his father, he put the case thus: “The question is not\r\nwhether I could do more good to others there or here; but whether\r\nI could do more good to myself: seeing wherever I can be most holy\r\nmyself, there I can most promote holiness in others. But I can improve\r\nmyself more at Oxford than at any other place,” etc.\r\n\r\nTo this his father properly replied that our main consideration in\r\nchoosing a course of life “is not dear self, but the glory of God, and\r\nthe different degrees of promoting it.”[120]\r\n\r\nJohn agreed to this; but argued that “that course of life tends most\r\nto the glory of God, wherein we can most promote holiness in ourselves\r\nand others;” and that at Oxford he had several advantages for doing\r\nthis which were almost peculiar to the place. 1. He could always have\r\nat hand half-a-dozen friends, nearly of his own judgment, and engaged\r\nin the same studies; persons who had wholly and absolutely devoted\r\nthemselves to God, and who denied themselves and took up their cross\r\ndaily. 2. He could not only have as much, but as little company as\r\nhe pleased; for he had no trifling visitors, except about an hour in\r\na month, when he invited some of the fellows to breakfast. 3. He was\r\nentirely free from worldly cares, for his income was ready for him on\r\nstated days, and all he had to do was to count it and carry it home.\r\n4. He had the privilege of public prayer twice a day, and of weekly\r\ncommunion. 5. At Oxford there was room for charity in all its forms;\r\npoor families to be relieved; children to be educated; workhouses and\r\nprisons to be visited; and the schools of the prophets, where tender\r\nminds were to be formed and strengthened. 6. He had the joint advice\r\nof many friends in any difficulty that might arise; the good bishop\r\nand vice-chancellor to supply his want of experience; and a fund,\r\nwhich this year would amount to near £80, to supply the bodily wants\r\nof the poor, and thereby prepare their souls to receive instruction.\r\nIn addition to all this, he alleges that the care of two thousand\r\nsouls at Epworth would crush him; and that, were he to abandon all\r\nhis Oxford advantages, he would not be able to stand his ground for a\r\nsingle month against intemperance in sleeping, eating, and drinking;\r\nagainst irregularity in study; against a general lukewarmness in\r\nhis affections, and remissness in his actions; against softness and\r\nself-indulgence, directly opposite to that discipline and hardship\r\nwhich become a soldier of Jesus Christ.[121]\r\n\r\nThe letter from which the above is taken is dated December 10, 1734.\r\nHis brother Samuel wrote a fortnight later, saying that his father\r\nhad told him John was unalterably resolved not to accept the living,\r\neven if he could get it. Samuel protests against the decision, and\r\nsays that in Wesley’s arguments he can see his love to himself, but he\r\ncannot see his love to his neighbour. Besides, he was not at liberty\r\nto resolve against undertaking a cure of souls, having been solemnly\r\nengaged to do this at his ordination. Charles might be silly enough to\r\nvow he would not depart from Oxford, and thereby avoid orders; but the\r\nfaith of John was already plighted to the contrary; and the idea scarce\r\never entered the head of any Christian but his own, that a parish\r\npriest cannot attain to the highest perfection possible on this side\r\nheaven.[122]\r\n\r\nWesley’s reasons and arguments were doubtless well intended; but they\r\nwere feeble, sophistical, and inconclusive. It is easy to imagine that\r\nthey would be painful both to his father and family; and it seems\r\nimpossible to excuse them except upon the ground that God had elected\r\nhim for another kind of work, and that by an unseen power he was\r\nprevented realising his father’s wishes. Wesley’s father died April\r\n25, 1735, and the Epworth living passed into other hands; but before\r\nproceeding farther, we give the last letter Wesley received from him.\r\n\r\nThe venerable rector was now anxiously employed in the publication of\r\nhis grand folio volume of 600 pages, “_Dissertationes in Librum Jobi_,”\r\nand had requested his son to assist him with the engravings for it.\r\n\r\n    “EPWORTH, _January 21, 1735_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SON,—About an hour since, your letter of the 13th\r\n    instant came to hand, and indeed not before I had need of it,\r\n    especially when I considered how extremely weak I was, and\r\n    found myself grow sensibly weaker every day. My people have\r\n    been very kind to me during my long illness, which has brought\r\n    me now so low that I cannot walk half-a-dozen times about my\r\n    chamber; but then I am often refreshed with seeing Mr. Hale’s\r\n    noble present of books to me lying in my window, near half of\r\n    which I have already spread in my parish, some to those who\r\n    came to see me, and to others I have sent them, and with very\r\n    good effect, many having read them, and some lent them to\r\n    others. A spirit of Christianity, beyond what I have hitherto\r\n    known, seems to be raised among them; one proof of which is in\r\n    the greater frequency of the sacraments. Nor is Mr. Whitelamb\r\n    wanting in any part of his duty, though I am not able to preach\r\n    or give the sacrament to them myself, except one day, and that\r\n    with his assistance.\r\n\r\n    “And now let us go on to matter of less moment, though I hope\r\n    not quite frivolous. Had I had all Mr. Rivington’s advice at\r\n    first, all my plates and cuts would have been done before\r\n    this, and that with less expense, and to greater perfection.\r\n    The agreement you have made with the engraver seems to be\r\n    very reasonable. Whether the cuts are to be done on sheets\r\n    or half sheets I leave to you and Mr. Rivington; but I would\r\n    have leviathan’s rival, that is, the whale, as well as the\r\n    crocodile. As for the elephant, he is so common that he need\r\n    not be added. I am glad the tombs want no more than retouching,\r\n    and especially that Mr. Garden is not ill pleased with them.\r\n    ‘Job in Adversity’ I leave to your direction, as likewise the\r\n    frontispiece, which Mr. Virtue is doing, who now duns me pretty\r\n    hard for money for it; and I have writ him lately to send me\r\n    word what he will charge for the whole when it is finished,\r\n    and what he desires in part, with a promise to send him some\r\n    money by the first opportunity I have of doing it. As for poor\r\n    Pentapolis, it must even shift as it can, though my heart is\r\n    pretty much in it, and I have taken a little pains about it.\r\n    This I must likewise leave with you; but cannot you send me a\r\n    copy of the drawings before they are engraven, that I may weigh\r\n    them, as is proper? As for Job’s horse, I cannot for my life\r\n    imagine how I shall get him into my Lord Oxford’s stable,—I\r\n    mean, get liberty to inscribe it to him, unless you yourself\r\n    would speak to my Lord Duplin about it. Have you yet found any\r\n    news of ‘_De Morbo Jobi_,’ which has been so long incognito?\r\n    Or, is there anything else that you find wanting? I heartily\r\n    commend you and your brother to God, and am this evening\r\n\r\n    Your affectionate father,\r\n    SAMUEL WESLEY.”[123]\r\n\r\nWesley endorsed this characteristic letter from his father with the\r\nwords, “The last I received from him.” Thirteen weeks afterwards, the\r\nvenerable man rested from his cares and earthly labours.\r\n\r\nOn June 11, 1734, Wesley preached before the university what his\r\nbrother Charles calls “his Jacobite sermon,” for which he was “much\r\nmauled and threatened.” He was prudent enough, however, before\r\npreaching it, to get the vice-chancellor to read and approve of it,\r\nand hence was able to set “Wadham, Merton, Exeter, and Christ Church”\r\nobjectors at defiance.\r\n\r\nHe then set out for Epworth, accompanied by Westley Hall, who proposed\r\nmarriage to his sister Keziah, greatly to the satisfaction of all the\r\nparties concerned, except Hall’s own mother. On his return to Oxford,\r\nhe spent some time in London, chiefly in consulting Mr. Law about one\r\nof his pupils, referred to in Wesley’s Works, vol. xii., p. 46; but\r\nalso partly in putting through the press his father’s “Dissertations on\r\nthe Book of Job.”[124]\r\n\r\nAbout the same period, he began the practice of reading as he rode on\r\nhorseback,—a practice he continued nearly forty years. He also made\r\nfrequent excursions to different parts of the country, often on foot;\r\nand, during the year, walked more than a thousand miles, constantly\r\npreaching on the sabbath, and already acting the part of an itinerant.\r\nHis walking, preaching, reading, studying, visiting, and fasting\r\nbegan to affect his health; he lost his strength, and frequently spat\r\nblood.[125] On the 16th of July, while asleep in bed, he had such an\r\nattack of bleeding as led him to exclaim: “O God, prepare me for Thy\r\ncoming, and then come when Thou wilt!” His friends became alarmed;\r\nand his mother wrote letters blaming him for neglecting his health. A\r\nphysician was called in, his advice adopted, and gradually the well\r\nworn devotee regained his lost vigour.[126]\r\n\r\nThough Wesley’s letter to his father, dated December 10, 1734, seemed\r\nto decide the question respecting his seeking to obtain the Epworth\r\nliving, his brother Samuel, during the correspondence arising out\r\nof it, started an idea which, ghost like, haunted Wesley for months\r\nafterwards, and which, we incline to think, had considerable influence\r\nin inducing him to change his views, and ultimately to go to Georgia.\r\n\r\nSamuel, on Christmas-day, 1734, wrote as follows:—“You are not at\r\nliberty to resolve against undertaking a cure of souls. You are\r\nsolemnly engaged to do it before God, and His high-priest, and His\r\nChurch. Are you not ordained? Did you not deliberately and openly\r\npromise to instruct, to teach, to admonish, to exhort those committed\r\nto your charge? Did you equivocate then with so vile a reservation, as\r\nto purpose in your heart that you would never have a charge? It is not\r\na college, it is not an university; it is the _order of the Church_,\r\naccording to which you were called.”[127]\r\n\r\nThis was touching Wesley in a tender place. On conscientious grounds,\r\nhe had already refused to apply for the Epworth living; and yet here\r\nhis brother Samuel maintains that on conscientious grounds, he is bound\r\nnot to bury himself at Oxford, but to undertake a cure of souls, either\r\nat Epworth or somewhere else. His faith is plighted. Before God and His\r\nChurch he has sworn to be, not a tutor, but a minister of Christ. What\r\nwas the effect of this? In December, 1734, Wesley refused to apply for\r\nhis father’s living; and yet, ten months afterwards, he left Oxford and\r\nset sail to Georgia. What occurred during this brief interval?\r\n\r\nIn January, 1735, Wesley wrote to Samuel, saying:—“I do not, nor ever\r\ndid, resolve against undertaking a cure of souls. There are four\r\ncures belonging to our college, and consistent with a fellowship. I\r\ndo not know but I may take one of them at Michaelmas. Not that I am\r\nclearly assured that I should be false to my engagement, were I only to\r\ninstruct and exhort the pupils committed to my charge. But of that I\r\nshould think more. I desire your full thoughts upon the whole, as well\r\nas your prayers.”[128]\r\n\r\nTo this Samuel replied, February 8, 1735:—“_The order of the Church_\r\nstakes you down, and the more you struggle you will be held the faster.\r\nIf there be such a thing as truth, I insist upon it, you must, when\r\nopportunity offers, either perform that promise, or repent of it.”[129]\r\n\r\nIn answer, five days afterwards, John remarked:—“Your last argument is\r\neither _ignoratio elenchi_, or implies these two propositions: 1. ‘You\r\nresolve against any parochial cure of souls.’ 2. ‘The priest who does\r\nnot undertake the first parochial cure that offers is perjured.’ Let us\r\nadd a third: ‘The tutor who, being in orders, never accepts of a parish\r\nis perjured.’ And then I deny all three.”[130]\r\n\r\nSamuel’s reply was as follows:—“An ordained tutor, who accepts not a\r\ncure, is perjured; alter the term into ‘who resolves not to accept,’\r\nand I will maintain it, unless you can prove either of these two: (1)\r\nthere is no such obligation at taking orders; (2) this obligation is\r\ndispensed with. Both which I utterly deny.”[131]\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March John replied:—“I had rather dispute with you,\r\nif I must dispute, than with any man living; because it may be done\r\nwith so little expense of time and words. You think I engaged myself\r\nat my ordination to undertake the cure of a parish. I think I did\r\nnot. However, I own I am not the proper judge of the oath I then\r\ntook; accordingly, the post after I received yours, I referred it to\r\n‘the high-priest of God,’ before whom I contracted that engagement,\r\nproposing this single question to him,—Whether I had, at my ordination,\r\nengaged myself to undertake the cure of a parish or no. His answer runs\r\nin these words: ‘It doth not seem to me that, at your ordination, you\r\nengaged yourself to undertake the cure of any parish, provided you can,\r\nas a clergyman, better serve God and His Church in your present or some\r\nother station.’ Now, that I can, as a clergyman, better serve God and\r\nHis Church in my present station, I have all reasonable evidence.”[132]\r\n\r\nWesley’s father died within two months after this; and yet, during\r\nthis short interval, Wesley seems to have been induced to lay aside\r\nhis scruples and to apply for the Epworth living. He applied, but he\r\nwas not successful. This is a bold assertion to be made in the teeth\r\nof statements directly opposite; statements made and repeated and\r\nre-repeated, without dispute, for more than the last seventy years: but\r\nbefore the reader rejects it, let him ponder the significance of the\r\nfollowing letter, written by Wesley’s friend, Broughton, and published,\r\nfor the first time, in the _Wesleyan Times_, of October 28, 1861:—\r\n\r\n    “LONDON, _April 15, 1735_.\r\n\r\n    “REV. AND DEAR SIR,—The same evening I received the favour of\r\n    yours, I waited on St. John, promising myself a kind reception.\r\n    He rejoiced with me to hear that your father was yet alive; but\r\n    did not close readily with me in attempting what, if crowned\r\n    with success, might prove a means of making our declining\r\n    friend end his days in peace. What shall we say for so sudden,\r\n    so unwished for a change? Oh, put not your trust in princes!\r\n    St. John disowns his giving me any encouragement to promise\r\n    you hopes of success. Did I then write you an untruth? If his\r\n    charge be just, I did; but his words were, ‘though he had\r\n    solicited the Bishop of London and Sir Robert on behalf of\r\n    another, not for Epworth, yet he would be glad to serve Mr.\r\n    Wesley.’ But where is the obstacle? Why, my lord of London,\r\n    who is usually consulted by the minister of state on such\r\n    occasions, spoke some disadvantageous things of you once in\r\n    the presence of St. John. But I could not but observe to our\r\n    friend that the misrepresented strictness of life, which gave\r\n    occasion for these disadvantageous things to be spoken of you,\r\n    was so far from being an objection to your being favoured by\r\n    a Christian bishop, that I humbly hoped it would turn to your\r\n    good account, inasmuch as over exactness of behaviour was the\r\n    sign of a tender and well regulated mind. But I cannot here\r\n    help thinking, ‘_Tros Tyriusve illi nullo discrimine agetur_.’\r\n    St. John thinks the Bishop of Oxford can be your friend. Yes,\r\n    I told him, my lord might give you a favourable word, if\r\n    asked; but I did not think the interest in his lordship was\r\n    so prevalent as to make him bestir himself on your behalf.\r\n    However, if you judge it proper to write to the bishop, I will\r\n    wait upon him, and do the best I can to serve my dear friend.\r\n\r\n    “Could your father’s book be presented to the queen soon? It\r\n    might do good. Do you know any great man about the court? The\r\n    king is not so difficult (I hope), if one could get a hearty\r\n    friend to espouse you. My interest in the speaker is not\r\n    powerful enough to bring about so desired a work; yet if there\r\n    was any other great man to befriend you, a serviceable hint\r\n    might be dropped. I doubt not but our good and loving God will\r\n    order this and everything else for your great and best good.\r\n    This is the wish and prayer of, dear sir,\r\n\r\n    “Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\n    “J. BROUGHTON.”\r\n\r\nBroughton was now curate at the Tower, in London.[133] Henry St.\r\nJohn, Viscount Bolingbroke, was a politician of great ability and\r\npower. Sir Robert Walpole was prime minister. The Bishop of London was\r\nthe celebrated Edmund Gibson. The Epworth living was a gift of the\r\ncrown. Bear these facts in mind, and the above epistle will be easily\r\ninterpreted.\r\n\r\nWesley’s objections to leave Oxford being overcome, probably by the\r\nhard facts and logic of his brother Samuel, he took steps to become his\r\nfather’s successor. Broughton, who was evidently a man of influence\r\nand position, was employed to secure the help of Bolingbroke; and\r\nBolingbroke had promised to use his endeavours to serve Wesley; but,\r\non being pressed to fulfil his promise, shrank from doing so, on the\r\nground that he had heard Gibson speak disparagingly of Wesley in\r\nWalpole’s presence; and, as the next presentation of the Epworth living\r\nwas, _ipso facto_, at the disposal of these two dignitaries, it was\r\nalmost useless to bring before them Wesley’s wish.\r\n\r\nBroughton suggests two other steps to be taken, which might be of\r\nservice in securing the living: (1) that the good services of the\r\nBishop of Oxford be solicited; and (2) that the dying rector’s\r\n“Dissertations on the Book of Job,” dedicated to Queen Caroline, might\r\nbe presented to her majesty as soon as possible. To adopt the second of\r\nthese suggestions was impracticable, as the work was only in the course\r\nof being printed, and the first opportunity of presenting a copy to the\r\nqueen did not occur until six months after the rector’s death. Whether\r\nthe first was carried out we have no means of knowing.\r\n\r\nThe reader will excuse these lengthy observations, on the ground\r\nthat they help to clear up what has always been a somewhat painfully\r\nmysterious chapter in Wesley’s history. It is not true that he could\r\nnot be induced to apply for his father’s living. Indirectly, at least,\r\nhe did apply, but failed; and, remembering this, the wonder is not so\r\ngreat that a few months afterwards he embarked for Georgia.[134]\r\n\r\nLittle more remains to be said before accompanying Wesley on his\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of this correspondence respecting the Epworth\r\nrectory, that George Whitefield was introduced to Wesley’s\r\nacquaintance, and became one of the Oxford Methodists.[135] Three years\r\nbefore, Whitefield had been admitted a servitor of Pembroke College,\r\nand had begun to pray and sing psalms five times every day. He longed\r\nto be acquainted with the Methodists, and often watched them passing,\r\nthrough ridiculing crowds, to receive the sacrament at St. Mary’s; but\r\nhe was a poor youth, the servitor of other students, and shrunk from\r\nobtruding himself upon their notice. At length, a woman, in one of\r\nthe workhouses, attempted to cut her throat; and Whitefield sent an\r\napple-seller, attached to Pembroke College, to inform Charles Wesley\r\nof her condition; and this led Charles to invite him to breakfast\r\nnext morning. He was now introduced to the rest of the Methodists,\r\nand adopted all their rules. The master of his college threatened to\r\nexpel him. Some of the students shot at him their shafts of ridicule;\r\nothers threw dirt at him; and others took away their pay from him.\r\nBeing in great distress about his soul, he lay whole days prostrate\r\non the ground, in silent or vocal prayer; he chose the worst sort of\r\nfood; he fasted twice a week; he wore woollen gloves, a patched gown,\r\nand dirty shoes; and, as a penitent, thought it unbecoming to have his\r\nhair powdered. Like all his brother Methodists, he observed Lent with\r\nthe greatest severity, eating no flesh during the six weeks, except\r\non Saturdays and Sundays. On the other days, his only food was coarse\r\nbread, and sage tea without sugar. Abstinence and inward conflicts\r\nbrought on illness; but, after about seven weeks, he was enabled\r\nto lay hold on Christ by a living faith, was filled with peace and\r\njoy, and became probably by far the most happy member of the Oxford\r\nbrotherhood.[136]\r\n\r\nMention has been already made of the first of Wesley’s\r\npublications,—his “Forms of Prayer,” printed in 1733. In 1735 he issued\r\nthree others.\r\n\r\nFirst, “A Sermon on the Trouble and Rest of Good Men, preached at St.\r\nMary’s, Oxford, on Sunday, September 21st, and published at the request\r\nof several of the hearers.” London: C. Rivington. 1735. This sermon,\r\nin two respects, is remarkable; (1) for its un-Wesleyan theology; (2)\r\nfor its boldly bearding Methodist persecutors in their head-quarters.\r\nThe preacher tells his hearers that “perfect holiness is not found\r\non earth; but death will destroy, at once, the whole body of sin,\r\nand therewith its companion—pain.” Two years before, in his sermon\r\non “The Circumcision of the Heart,” Wesley had given a beautiful\r\ndefinition of “holiness;” but here he teaches that this holiness is not\r\nattainable in life; not until the hour of death; a different doctrine\r\nthis to that which he afterwards embodied in his “Plain Account of\r\nChristian Perfection.” But however much the preacher lacked theological\r\ncorrectness, there was no lack of heroic daring: remembering that, for\r\nsix years past, he and his associates had been the constant butt of\r\ncollegiate scorn and ridicule, and that his present congregation, in\r\na great degree, consisted of those who had thought it a privilege to\r\nmake themselves witty at his expense; one cannot but admire his pluck\r\nin telling them, face to face, that, “as at first, he that was born\r\nafter the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so\r\nit is now, and so it must be, till all things are fulfilled. Despisers\r\nwere now multiplied upon the earth, who feared not the Son, neither the\r\nFather; but blasphemed the Lord and His Anointed; either reviling the\r\nwhole of His glorious gospel, or making Him a liar as to some of the\r\nblessed truths revealed therein. But in heaven good men are hid from\r\nthe scourge of the tongue. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the prophets\r\ndo not revile, or separate them from their company. They are no longer\r\ndespitefully used, and persecuted; neither do they groan under the hand\r\nof the oppressor. In a word, in heaven there is no earthly or sensual,\r\nno devilish spirit; none who do not love the Lord their God with all\r\ntheir heart.”\r\n\r\nThe second of Wesley’s publications, in 1735, was “The Christian’s\r\nPattern; or, a Treatise of the Imitation of Christ. Written originally\r\nin Latin by Thomas à Kempis. With a Preface containing an Account\r\nof the Usefulness of this Treatise. Compared with the original, and\r\ncorrected throughout. By John Wesley, M.A.” London: C. Rivington. Of\r\nthis work he, at the same time, published two editions,—one in 8vo, 319\r\npages, with five engravings; and the other in 24mo, 344 pages, with a\r\nfrontispiece.\r\n\r\nHis third publication was a manuscript written by his father, and was\r\nentitled, “Advice to a Young Clergyman. By a Divine of the Church of\r\nEngland.” 12mo, 76 pages.\r\n\r\nWe now bid adieu to Oxford. We have seen Methodism at its\r\nfountain-head; we must hereafter trace it, in its streams of blessing,\r\nall the wide world over. The principles and practices of Oxford\r\nMethodism may easily be gathered from the present chapter. Nothing has\r\nbeen omitted, nothing exaggerated, and nothing altered. The system was\r\ncradled in a storm, and more than once, even at Oxford, was in danger\r\nof perishing. At least twice, during Wesley’s absence, it was all but\r\nwrecked; and, from names casually mentioned, we incline to think its\r\npermanently established converts were much less numerous than its\r\ntimid, time serving backsliders. At all events, but for the ministry of\r\nthe two Wesleys, of Whitefield, Ingham, Hervey, and Gambold, the memory\r\nof Oxford Methodism might, without public loss, have been buried in\r\noblivion. As it is, no English historian can ignore it. In its results\r\nit is one of the greatest facts in church annals. At Oxford, it was far\r\nfrom perfect. It was misty, austere, gloomy, and forbidding; but it was\r\nintensely sincere, earnest, and self denying. Its principles and its\r\naims may substantially be summed up in the words of Wesley himself,\r\nwritten forty years afterwards:—\r\n\r\n“Two young men, without a name, without friends, without either power\r\nor fortune, set out from college with principles totally different\r\nfrom those of the common people, to oppose all the world, learned and\r\nunlearned; and to combat popular prejudices of every kind. Their first\r\nprinciple directly attacked all the wickedness; their second, all\r\nthe bigotry in the world. Thus they attempted a reformation, not of\r\nopinions (feathers, trifles not worth naming), but of men’s tempers and\r\nlives; of vice in every kind; of everything contrary to justice, mercy,\r\nor truth. And for this it was, that they carried their lives in their\r\nhands; and that both the great vulgar and the small looked upon them as\r\nmad dogs, and treated them as such.”[137]\r\n\r\nLet us follow them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_MISSION TO GEORGIA. 1735‒””””1737._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1735 Age 32]\r\n\r\nWESLEY’S father died on the 25th of April, 1735.\r\n\r\nImmediately after that event, the chief of the Oxford Methodists were\r\nwidely scattered: Gambold was a clergyman at Stanton-Harcourt; Ingham\r\nbecame a curate in Essex; Whitefield, though not ordained, went on\r\nan evangelistic tour to Gloucester, Bristol, and other places;[138]\r\nBroughton was chaplain at the Tower; and the two Wesleys repaired to\r\nthe metropolis, where they were the guests of James Hutton, or rather\r\nof James Hutton’s father, in Westminster.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutton was now in the twentieth year of his age. At Oxford he had\r\nmet with the Wesley brothers, and had invited them to visit him. His\r\nfather was an ordained clergyman of the Church of England; but, not\r\nbeing able to take the oaths at the accession of George I., he had\r\nresigned his Church preferments, and now kept a boarding school in a\r\nhouse next door to that of Wesley’s brother Samuel. Here, on Sunday\r\nevenings, the venerable man held meetings, at which he read, and\r\nprayed, and sung with penitents; and here Wesley preached a sermon on\r\n“One thing is needful,” which was the means of converting both James\r\nHutton and his sister.[139]\r\n\r\nJust at this juncture, Dr. John Burton, of Corpus Christi College,\r\nOxford, was evincing great interest in the colonisation of Georgia.\r\nThree years before, he had preached and published a sermon, with an\r\nappendix on the state of the Georgian settlement. He now met with\r\nWesley in London, and introduced him to Oglethorpe, who strongly urged\r\nthe high church Methodist to undertake a mission to the infant colony.\r\nWesley took counsel with his brother Samuel; asked the advice of\r\nWilliam Law; and went to Manchester to consult his friends Clayton and\r\nByrom. Thence he proceeded to Epworth, and laid the proposal before his\r\nwidowed mother, who replied: “Had I twenty sons, I should rejoice if\r\nthey were all so employed.”\r\n\r\nOn September 8 Dr. Burton wrote to him pressing him to consent to go.\r\nThe doctor told him that “plausible and popular doctors of divinity\r\nwere not the men wanted for Georgia; for the ease, luxury, and levity\r\nin which they were accustomed to indulge disqualified them for such a\r\nwork.” He and the Georgian trustees wished for men who were “inured\r\nto contempt of the ornaments and conveniences of life, to bodily\r\nausterities, and to serious thoughts;” and such he considered Wesley.\r\n\r\nTen days after the date of this letter Wesley accepted the proposal,\r\nand Burton expressed his pleasure, and added, “You have too much\r\nsteadiness of mind to be disturbed by the light scoffs of the idle\r\nand profane.”[140] In another long letter (hitherto unpublished),\r\ndated Eton College, September 28, 1735, Dr. Burton, after reminding\r\nWesley that he will have a fine opportunity for usefulness during\r\nthe voyage to Georgia, proceeds to recommend him, on his arrival, to\r\nvisit from house to house, and preach everywhere. He tells him that\r\n“some of the colonists are ignorant, and most of them are disposed to\r\nlicentiousness.” He adds: “You will find abundant room for the exercise\r\nof patience and prudence, as well as piety. One end for which we were\r\nassociated was the conversion of negro slaves. As yet, nothing has been\r\nattempted in this way; but a door is opened. The Purisburghers have\r\npurchased slaves; they act under our influence; and Mr. Oglethorpe will\r\nthink it advisable to begin there. You see the harvest truly is great.\r\nWith regard to your behaviour and manner of address, you will keep in\r\nmind the pattern of St. Paul, who became ‘all things to all men that he\r\nmight gain some.’ In every case, distinguish between what is essential\r\nand what is merely circumstantial to Christianity; between what is\r\nindispensable and what is variable; between what is of Divine and what\r\nis of human authority. I mention this, because men are apt to deceive\r\nthemselves in such cases; and we see the traditions and ordinances of\r\nmen frequently insisted on with more vigour than the commandments of\r\nGod to which they are subordinate.”\r\n\r\nThis was good advice, and, in Wesley’s case, not unneeded. Sixteen days\r\nafter the date of Dr. Burton’s letter, Wesley embarked, taking with\r\nhim five hundred and fifty copies of a treatise on the Lord’s Supper,\r\nbesides other books,—“the gift of several Christian friends for the use\r\nof the settlers in Georgia.”[141]\r\n\r\nJames Edward Oglethorpe was the third son of Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe,\r\nof Godalming, Surrey. At a suitable age he entered the army, and became\r\nsecretary and aide-de-camp to Prince Eugene. In 1722 he succeeded\r\nto his father’s estate, and obtained a seat in parliament, which he\r\nretained nearly thirty years. From the first, he showed himself to be\r\na steady and faithful friend of humanity. These were days of harsh\r\ngovernment. The gallows was the penalty for petty thefts; and each\r\nyear, at least four thousand unhappy men in Great Britain were immured\r\nin prison for the misfortune of being poor. A small debt was quite\r\nenough to expose a struggling man to a perpetuity of imprisonment; and\r\nan indiscreet bargain doomed many a well-meaning, miserable dupe to\r\nlifelong confinement. Oglethorpe obtained a parliamentary committee, to\r\ninquire into the state of prisons; the result of which was that a large\r\nnumber of debtors were released from confinement, and restored to light\r\nand to liberty. Being released, it was a serious question what to do\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that, though the whole of the eastern seaboard of\r\nAmerica seemed to be already parcelled out among companies and\r\ncolonists, there was still remaining a comparatively small strip of\r\ncountry, intervening between South Carolina and Florida, and situated\r\nbetween the river Alatamaha on the south and the river Savannah on\r\nthe north, and having a sea-coast stretching a distance of sixty or\r\nseventy miles. This strip of land was a wilderness over which England\r\nheld only a nominal jurisdiction; but it occurred to Oglethorpe and\r\nhis friends to plant in this sunny clime those children of misfortune\r\nwhom they had released from prison, but who were still without food\r\nand shelter. Accordingly, on the 9th of June, 1732, a charter was\r\nobtained from George II., erecting this thin slice of America into\r\nthe province of Georgia, and appointing Oglethorpe and twenty other\r\ngentlemen (of whom Dr. Burton was one) trustees to hold the same\r\nfor a period of one and twenty years, “in trust for the poor.” The\r\nbenevolence of England was aroused. The trustees set an example of\r\nprincely liberality by their private subscriptions; the Bank of England\r\npresented a donation of £10,000; an equal amount was voted by the House\r\nof Commons; and the total sum raised, with but little effort, and\r\nalmost without solicitation, was £36,000. Within five months after the\r\nsigning of the charter, the first company of emigrants, one hundred\r\nand twenty in number, set sail, with Oglethorpe as their commander,\r\nand the Rev. Henry Herbert, a clergyman of the Established Church, as\r\ntheir minister. At the commencement of the month of February, 1733,\r\nthe colonists reached the high bluff on which Savannah is now erected,\r\nand encamped near the edge of the river. The streets of the intended\r\ntown were laid out with the greatest regularity; and the houses were\r\nto be constructed on one model,—each a frame of sawn timber, measuring\r\nsixteen feet by twenty-four, its sides to be enclosed with unplaned\r\nboards, and its floor to be of rough deals, and its roof of shingle.\r\nEach freeholder was allotted fifty acres of ground, five of which were\r\nnear Savannah, and the remaining forty-five farther off. Thus began\r\nthe commonwealth of Georgia. The humane reformer of prison life was\r\nalready the father of a state. A large number of Indians met him to\r\nmake an alliance with his colony; the meeting was friendly; to each\r\nchief he gave a laced coat, a hat, and a shirt; and to their attendants\r\ngunpowder, bullets, linen, tobacco, pipes, tape, and eight kegs of rum,\r\nto carry home as presents to their respective towns. In a letter,\r\ndated June 9, 1733, Oglethorpe states that a door was opened for the\r\nconversion of the Indians; and nothing seemed to be wanting but a\r\nminister who understood their language: in action and expression, they\r\nwere masters of eloquence, and many of their speeches were equal to\r\nthose which scholars most admire in the Greek and Roman writings.[142]\r\n\r\nThe next company of emigrants belonged to a different class. About\r\na year before the charter for the Georgian colony was granted, a\r\nremarkable revival of religion took place at Saltzburg, in Germany.\r\nBy merely reading the Bible, above twenty thousand people were led\r\nto renounce Popery and to embrace the Reformed religion. The popish\r\npriests complained to the Archbishop of Saltzburg that these Protestant\r\nconverts assembled in various places, and sang hymns and offered\r\nprayers. The archbishop published an edict prohibiting such assemblies,\r\nupon pain of fines, corporal punishments, and even death itself. The\r\nnew converts, however, still assembled as before; and now his serene\r\nhighness the archbishop let loose his partisans, and commenced a\r\nmurderous persecution, which drove thousands of innocent, unoffending,\r\ngodly people into exile. Numbers were dragged to prison; some were led\r\nabout with ropes round their necks; others had their hands so tightly\r\ntied with cords behind their backs that the blood spurted from their\r\nfinger ends. The archbishop’s soldiers struck some of them in the face\r\nwith their fists, calling them “heretic dogs and hell-hounds.” One poor\r\nfellow was fined seventy florins for singing a Protestant psalm of\r\npraise. Protestant preachers were called “murderers, buffle-heads, and\r\nchildren of the devil;” and the Protestant doctrine was stigmatised as\r\n“faith for swine and stinking goats.” Every one who embraced Luther’s\r\ndoctrines “would be roasted in hell;” and the moment any one read his\r\nbooks the reader “became an offering to the devil.”[143]\r\n\r\nWhat was the result? The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel\r\nin Foreign Parts heard of these poor persecuted Protestants, and\r\nproposed to them to emigrate to Georgia. Thousands of them had fled\r\nfrom Saltzburg; and others were still in prison there, fed with bread\r\nand water, and employing themselves in praying and singing psalms.\r\nLarge numbers were taken into service by Protestants at Augsburg and\r\nother places; and one section of the fugitives embraced the proposal\r\njust mentioned, and on October 31, 1733, set out for Georgia. After a\r\ndiscourse, prayer, and benedictions, and well supplied with Bibles,\r\nhymns, catechisms, and books of devotion, they began their pilgrimage,\r\none wagon conveying all the chattels that they had, and two others\r\ntheir feebler companions and their little ones. We need not stop to\r\ntell the charities that cheered them on their journey,—how they entered\r\nFrankfort, two by two, in solemn procession, singing sacred songs,—and\r\nhow they were joined at Rotterdam by the preachers Bolzius and Gronau,\r\nboth disciplined in piety at the Orphan House of Professor Francke. Six\r\ndays brought them to Dover, where several of the Georgian trustees met\r\nthem and provided for their wants; and on January 8, 1734, they set\r\nsail, singing the “Te Deum” and praising God with both lips and hearts.\r\n\r\nThe Saltzburghers arrived in Georgia in the month of March, met with\r\nOglethorpe, and chose a settlement twenty-one miles from Savannah,\r\nwhere there were “rivers, little hills, clear brooks, cool springs,\r\na fertile soil, and plenty of grass.” At Charlestown, where they\r\nfirst landed, they ascertained that in the province of Carolina there\r\nwere thirty thousand negroes, all of them slaves, working six days\r\nin the week for their owners without pay, and allowed to work on the\r\nSundays for themselves. Near Savannah, they found a beautiful garden\r\nof ten acres, already planted with thriving orange-trees, olives,\r\nmulberries, figs, peaches, cabbages, peas, and pulse. The spot which\r\nthey had chosen as their settlement, and to which they gave the name of\r\nEbenezer, was surrounded by vast forests of cedars, walnuts, cypresses,\r\nand oaks, with wild vines running to the top of the highest trees.\r\nAs to game, there were eagles, turkeys, roebucks, goats, deer, wild\r\ncows, horses, hares, partridges, and buffaloes without number. The\r\nSaltzburghers built tents made of the bark of trees, constructed roads\r\nand bridges, set up religious services, were furnished with domestic\r\nutensils and with cattle, and were soon a prosperous community.\r\n\r\nIn April Oglethorpe returned to England, bringing with him Tomo-chichi\r\nand other Indians, to invigorate the confidence of England in the\r\ndestiny of Georgia. Parliament continued its benefactions, the king\r\nexpressed interest in a province which bore his name, and the youngest\r\nchild of England’s colonial enterprise won universal favour.\r\n\r\nThe next company of emigrants were a number of Scotch Highlanders,\r\nwho founded New Inverness, in Darien; the next a number of Moravians,\r\nof whom more anon; and the next after that, the company with whom\r\nWesley sailed. Wesley’s predecessor in Georgia was the Rev. Samuel\r\nQuincy,[144] a native of Massachusetts, but educated in England. Mr.\r\nQuincy wishing to return to England, the Society for the Propagation of\r\nthe Gospel in Foreign Parts sent Wesley as his successor, at a salary\r\nof £50 a year.[145] The chief object in founding the colony was to grow\r\nflax and hemp, to breed silkworms, and to raise raw silk.[146] The\r\ncommon seal of the corporation had on one side a group of silkworms at\r\ntheir toils, with the motto, _Non sibi, sed aliis_; and on the other,\r\ntwo figures reposing on urns, emblematic of the boundary rivers; and\r\nbetween them the genius of “Georgia Augusta,” with the cap of liberty\r\non her head, a spear in one hand, and the horn of plenty in the other.\r\nIt must be added that in this young community ardent spirits were\r\nprohibited, and the introduction of slavery forbidden.\r\n\r\nThe Transatlantic colonies existing in 1735 were nothing more than a\r\nmere fringe skirting the eastern coast of that vast continent. The\r\nSpaniards were in Florida; the English in Georgia, the Carolinas,\r\nVirginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New England; and the French in\r\nCanada. This was all. Excepting these few feeble colonial settlements,\r\nthe whole of the immense American continent—which, measuring from New\r\nYork to California, and from Lake Superior to New Orleans, extends in\r\none direction 3300 miles and in the other 1300 miles—was one vast,\r\nrich, but uncultivated wilderness, the home of myriads of birds and\r\nbeasts, and sparsely inhabited by savage Indians. Bancroft enumerates\r\nabove forty Indian tribes, or nations, embracing about 180,000 souls,\r\nwhose wigwams and hunting grounds were all situated on the eastern side\r\nof the Mississippi. The men were warriors, and the women labourers.\r\nTheir education was acquired solely in the school of nature, and their\r\nchief almanac was the flight of birds, announcing the progress of the\r\nseasons. They kept no herds, and were never shepherds, but depended\r\nfor their food on the chase, the fisheries, and a little farming.\r\nTheir scanty clothing was made of skins, and their feet protected by\r\nsoft mocassins. Their principal ornaments were strings of shells, the\r\nfairest feathers of the turkey, the skin of the rattlesnake, and an\r\nenemy’s scalp. Their skins were oft tattooed; and, when making visits,\r\nthey painted themselves gloriously, delighting especially in vermilion.\r\nThey worshipped an unseen power pervading everything, which they called\r\nthe Great Spirit, and had their sorcerers, medicine men, and prophets.\r\nFaith in the spirit world, as revealed by dreams, was universal; and\r\nfestivals in honour of the dead were frequent.\r\n\r\nWhat became of these Indians? and where are their descendants? To\r\nanswer these questions would be to pass through scenes of horror\r\nwithout a parallel, and to write a history of blood.\r\n\r\nSuch was America in 1735. What is it now, and what is likely to be its\r\nfuture? Who could have imagined that, in one hundred and thirty years,\r\nthis huge wilderness would be transformed into one of the greatest\r\nnations upon earth; and that the Methodism, begun at Savannah, would\r\npervade the continent, and, ecclesiastically considered, become the\r\nmightiest power existing? But we must now return to Wesley and his\r\nGeorgian mission.\r\n\r\nIn a letter, dated October 10, 1735, Wesley gives his reasons for going\r\nto Georgia. He writes:—\r\n\r\n    “My chief motive is the hope of saving my own soul. I hope to\r\n    learn the true sense of the gospel of Christ by preaching it\r\n    to the heathen. They have no comments to construe away the\r\n    text; no vain philosophy to corrupt it; no luxurious, sensual,\r\n    covetous, ambitious expounders to soften its unpleasing truths.\r\n    They have no party, no interest to serve, and are therefore fit\r\n    to receive the gospel in its simplicity. They are as little\r\n    children, humble, willing to learn, and eager to do, the will\r\n    of God.\r\n\r\n    “A right faith will, I trust, by the mercy of God, open the way\r\n    for a right practice; especially when most of those temptations\r\n    are removed which here so easily beset me. It will be no small\r\n    thing to be able, without fear of giving offence, to live on\r\n    water and the fruits of the earth. An Indian hut affords no\r\n    food for curiosity, no gratification of the desire of grand, or\r\n    new, or pretty things. The pomp and show of the world have no\r\n    place in the wilds of America.\r\n\r\n    “Further: I hope from the moment I leave the English shore,\r\n    under the acknowledged character of a teacher sent from God,\r\n    there shall be no word heard from my lips but what properly\r\n    flows from that character; and the same faithfulness I hope\r\n    to show in dispensing my Master’s goods, if it please Him to\r\n    send me to those who, like His first followers, have all things\r\n    common. What a guard is here against that root of evil, the\r\n    love of money, and all the vile attractions that spring from it!\r\n\r\n    “I then hope to know what it is to love my neighbour as\r\n    myself, and to feel the powers of that second motive to visit\r\n    the heathens, even the desire to impart to them what I have\r\n    received,—a saving knowledge of the gospel of Christ. I have\r\n    been a grievous sinner from my youth up, and am yet laden with\r\n    foolish and hurtful desires; but I am assured, if I be once\r\n    converted myself, God will then employ me both to strengthen my\r\n    brethren, and to preach His name to the gentiles.\r\n\r\n    “I cannot hope to attain the same degree of holiness here,\r\n    which I may there. I shall lose nothing I desire to keep. I\r\n    shall still have food to eat, and raiment to put on; and, if\r\n    any man have a desire of other things, let him know that the\r\n    greatest blessing that can possibly befall him is, to be cut\r\n    off from all occasions of gratifying those desires which,\r\n    unless speedily rooted out, will drown his soul in everlasting\r\n    perdition.”[147]\r\n\r\nException may fairly be taken to some of the sentiments contained in\r\nthis letter. The Indians were not the docile children that Wesley\r\nimagined; nor is it true that life in heathendom is more favourable to\r\nthe attainment of holiness than life in Christendom: but we neither\r\nhave space nor wish to criticise Wesley’s views, our chief object being\r\nto represent him as he represents himself.\r\n\r\nWesley went on board the _Simmonds_, off Gravesend, on October 14,\r\n1735; and, the day following, he wrote a characteristic letter,\r\n(probably his last before leaving the English waters,) to his brother\r\nSamuel, who was now head master of the school at Tiverton. After\r\ntelling him that, two days before, he had presented to the queen his\r\nfather’s “Dissertations on the Book of Job,” and had received “many\r\ngood words and smiles,” he continues:—\r\n\r\n    “Elegance of style is not to be weighed against purity of\r\n    heart; therefore, whatever has any tendency to impair that\r\n    purity is not to be tolerated, much less recommended, for\r\n    the sake of that elegance. But of this sort are most of the\r\n    classics usually read in great schools: many of them tending\r\n    to inflame the lusts of the flesh, and more to feed the lust\r\n    of the eye and the pride of life. I beseech you therefore,\r\n    by the mercies of God, who would have us holy as He is holy,\r\n    that you banish all such poison from your school; and that you\r\n    introduce, in their place, such Christian authors as will work\r\n    together with you in building up your flock in the knowledge\r\n    and love of God. For assure yourself, dear brother, you are\r\n    even now called to the converting of heathens as well as I. So\r\n    many souls are committed to your charge by God, to be prepared\r\n    for a happy eternity. You are to instruct them, not only in the\r\n    beggarly elements of Greek and Latin; but much more, in the\r\n    gospel. You are to labour with all your might to convince them,\r\n    that Christianity is not a negation, or an external thing, but\r\n    a new heart, a mind conformed to that of Christ, ‘faith working\r\n    by love,’”[148]\r\n\r\nTwo days after writing the above, Wesley, in order to converse with\r\nhis German fellow-passengers, began to study that language; and three\r\ndays later, believing that self-denial might be helpful to his piety,\r\nhe wholly left off the use of flesh and wine, and confined himself to\r\na vegetable diet, chiefly rice and biscuit. This he continued during\r\nthe whole of his residence in Georgia; but on his return to England,\r\nfor the sake of some who thought he made it a point of conscience, he\r\nresumed his former mode of living, and practised it to the end of life,\r\nexcept during a two years’ interim, when he again became vegetarian and\r\nteetotaler, because Dr. Cheyne assured him that this was the only way\r\nto “be free from fevers.”[149]\r\n\r\nWesley is on board—who are the chief of his fellow voyagers? His\r\nbrother Charles, Benjamin Ingham, James Edward Oglethorpe, Charles\r\nDelamotte, and David Nitschmann. Two others had intended going, namely,\r\nWestley Hall and Matthew Salmon; and both had been recently ordained\r\nwith reference to the Georgian mission. At the last moment, however,\r\nSalmon’s friends pounced upon him, and sent him, almost forcibly, to\r\nhis parental home in Cheshire; while Hall, who had actually hired\r\na coach to carry him and his wife (Wesley’s sister) to Gravesend,\r\nwhere the ship was lying, received, as he was about to start, the\r\nintelligence that his family were not only opposed to his embarking,\r\nbut had procured him a Church benefice. This so changed his missionary\r\nviews and feelings, that he instantly countermanded the order for the\r\ncoach, put aside all his luggage and preparations for the mission,\r\nand, hastening to General Oglethorpe, told him he had resolved not to\r\ngo.[150]\r\n\r\nOf Charles Wesley nothing need be said; his fame is everywhere.\r\nBenjamin Ingham was a young Yorkshireman, twenty-three years of age,\r\nand, for the last three months, had been preaching in the villages\r\nsurrounding the metropolis with singular success. “Fast, and pray,”\r\nwrote Wesley at the beginning of September: “fast and pray; and then\r\nsend me word whether you dare go with me to the Indians.” Ingham at\r\nfirst thought there were heathens enough at home; but, a fortnight\r\nafter, he acceded to Wesley’s proposal; and, with as pure and devoted a\r\nheart as ever throbbed in missionary’s bosom, away he went to convert\r\nthe Indians in America.\r\n\r\nOglethorpe has been already mentioned. Suffice it to add, that though\r\nchivalrous in the highest degree, and the very soul of benevolence and\r\nhonour,—though brave and loyal, and full of enthusiastic feeling,—he\r\nwas irascible and sometimes rash, talkative, tinged with vanity, and\r\nsomewhat boastful. Like many other public men, he became the victim\r\nof unmerited censure and injudicious praise. The last thirty years of\r\nhis life were chiefly spent in the society of literary and learned\r\nmen. He died in 1785; and Hannah More, in a letter dated a year before\r\nhis death, spoke of him thus: “He is much above ninety years old, and\r\nthe finest figure you ever saw. He perfectly realises all my ideas of\r\nNestor. His literature is great, his knowledge of the world extensive,\r\nand his faculties as bright as ever. He is quite a _preux chevalier_,\r\nheroic, romantic, and full of the old gallantry.”\r\n\r\nCharles Delamotte was a young man of twenty-one, the son of a Middlesex\r\nmagistrate; and was so attached to Wesley, that when he heard he was\r\nabout to embark for Georgia he determined to go with him, and to act\r\nas his servant. His father, naturally enough, strongly objected,\r\nand offered to settle him in a handsome business; but the youth was\r\nobstinate, and after obtaining a partial consent from his parents and\r\nfamily, set sail with Wesley, lived with him, served under him as a son\r\nin the gospel, did much good, and endured great hardships for the sake\r\nof Christ. On his return to England, he became a Moravian, settled at\r\nBarrow-upon-Humber, where he spent a long life of piety and peace, and\r\ndied in 1796.[151]\r\n\r\nDavid Nitschmann was born in Moravia, and was now in the sixtieth year\r\nof his age. In 1720 a remarkable revival of religion took place in the\r\ntown where David lived; but, by the intervention of the Jesuits, the\r\nmeetings of the new converts were prohibited, and many who attended\r\nthem were imprisoned in stables, cellars, and other offensive places.\r\nA police officer entered Nitschmann’s house, where one hundred and\r\nfifty of these godly people were assembled, and seized all the books\r\nwithin his reach. The congregation at once struck up a stanza of one of\r\nLuther’s hymns:—\r\n\r\n    “If the whole world with devils swarmed,\r\n      That threatened us to swallow,\r\n    We will not fear, for we are armed,\r\n      And victory will follow.”\r\n\r\nTwenty persons, including David, all heads of respectable families,\r\nwere arrested and sent to gaol. For three days David was deprived of\r\nfood, and was so cruelly ironed that the blood spurted from his nose\r\nand mouth, and oozed from his very pores. After some time, he escaped\r\nfrom his horrid dungeon, and fled for safety to his Moravian friends at\r\nHerrnhut. David was now a Moravian bishop, and, accompanied by about\r\nthirty Moravians, was on his way to visit the congregations of the\r\nBrethren in Georgia.\r\n\r\nSuch were the chief of Wesley’s fellow voyagers. As already stated,\r\nthey embarked at Gravesend on October 14, 1735; but it was not\r\nuntil December 10 that they fairly started.[152] First of all, they\r\nencountered a storm in the Downs; then, on arriving at Cowes, they had\r\nto await the man-of-war that was to be their convoy.\r\n\r\nThe rules which Wesley and his friends observed during their long\r\nvoyage were as follows:—From four in the morning till five, they\r\nemployed in private prayer. From five to seven, they read the Bible\r\ntogether, carefully comparing what they read with the writings of the\r\nearliest ages. At seven, they breakfasted. At eight, they had public\r\nprayers and expounded the lesson. From nine to twelve, Wesley usually\r\nlearned German, Delamotte studied Greek and navigation, Charles Wesley\r\nwrote sermons, and Ingham gave instruction to the twelve children on\r\nboard. At twelve, they met together for mutual prayer, and to report\r\nprogress. About one, they dined; and from the time of dinner till four\r\nin the afternoon, they read or spoke to certain of the passengers of\r\nwhom they had respectively taken charge. At four, they had evening\r\nprayers, and either expounded the lesson, or catechized and instructed\r\nthe children in the presence of the congregation. From five to six was\r\nagain spent in private prayer. From six to seven they read, each in his\r\nown cabin, to three different detachments of the English passengers, of\r\nwhom about eighty were on board. At seven, Wesley joined the Moravians\r\nin their public service; while Ingham read, between the decks, to as\r\nmany as desired to hear. At eight, the four faithful friends met in\r\nprivate to exhort and instruct each other; and, between nine and ten,\r\nthey went to bed without mats and blankets, where neither the roaring\r\nof the sea nor the rocking of the ship could rob them of refreshing\r\nrest.[153]\r\n\r\nWhile detained at Cowes, Wesley, after careful instruction, baptized\r\nfour unbaptized Quakers.[154] Charles Wesley, being known to the\r\nminister of the town, preached several times in the parish church\r\nto large congregations; and, in the house of a poor woman, read to\r\nthe crowds which flocked to hear him. In other respects also their\r\ndetention was productive of good; for a gentleman who scoffed at\r\nreligion left the ship; the second mate, who was an insolent and ill\r\nnatured fellow, was expelled; and a young man was received on board,\r\nwho, for his piety, had been turned adrift by his rich parents, and had\r\nbeen praying incessantly that he might be directed to a place where he\r\ncould have the advantage of public prayers and the holy sacrament.\r\n\r\nOn November 3, while walking in the Isle of Wight, the four friends\r\nagreed upon the following resolutions, which they solemnly subscribed:—\r\n\r\n    “IN the name of God, Amen! We, whose names are underwritten,\r\n    being fully convinced that it is impossible, either to\r\n    promote the work of God among the heathen, without an entire\r\n    union among ourselves, or that such a union should subsist,\r\n    unless each one will give up his single judgment to that of\r\n    the majority, do agree, by the help of God:—first, that none\r\n    of us will undertake anything of importance without first\r\n    proposing it to the other three;—secondly, that whenever our\r\n    judgments differ, any one shall give up his single judgment\r\n    or inclination to the others;—thirdly, that in case of an\r\n    equality, after begging God’s direction, the matter shall be\r\n    decided by lot.\r\n\r\n    JOHN WESLEY,\r\n    CHARLES WESLEY,\r\n    BENJAMIN INGHAM,\r\n    CHARLES DELAMOTTE.”[155]\r\n\r\nOf the Moravians on board, Ingham, in a long letter to his mother,\r\nwrote as follows:—“They are a good, devout, peaceable, and\r\nheavenly-minded people; and almost the only time you know they are in\r\nthe ship is when they are harmoniously singing the praises of the great\r\nCreator, which they constantly do twice a day. Their example was very\r\nedifying. They are more like the primitive Christians than any church\r\nnow existing, for they retain both the faith, practice, and discipline\r\ndelivered by the apostles. They have regularly ordained bishops,\r\npriests, and deacons. Baptisms, confirmation, and the eucharist are\r\nduly administered. Discipline is strictly exercised, without respect\r\nof persons. They all submit themselves to their pastors in everything.\r\nThey live together in perfect love and peace, having for the present\r\nall things common. They are more ready to serve their neighbours\r\nthan themselves. In business they are diligent, in all their dealings\r\nstrictly just; and in everything they behave themselves with meekness,\r\nsweetness, and humility.”\r\n\r\nFrom the same letter we learn that, on October 18, Wesley and Ingham\r\nbegan to read the Old Testament together; and, at the rate of between\r\nnine and ten chapters daily, finished it before they arrived at\r\nGeorgia. On the day following, Wesley commenced preaching without\r\nnotes; and during the passage, in a series of sermons, he went through\r\nthe whole of our Saviour’s sermon on the mount, and, every sabbath, had\r\na weekly sacrament.\r\n\r\nThe voyage, from Cowes to the Savannah river, was made in fifty-seven\r\ndays. Oglethorpe seems to have acted with great kindness. On one\r\noccasion, when some of the officers and gentlemen on board took\r\nliberties with Wesley and his friends, Oglethorpe indignantly\r\nexclaimed, “What mean you, sirs? Do you take these gentlemen for\r\ntithe-pig parsons? They are gentlemen of learning and respectability.\r\nThey are my friends, and whoever offers an affront to them insults\r\nme.”[156] This was quite enough, and, ever after, the poor Methodists\r\nwere treated with respect. Oglethorpe was irritable, but noble-hearted\r\nand generous. Wesley, hearing an unusual noise in the general’s cabin,\r\nentered to inquire the cause; on which the angry soldier cried: “Excuse\r\nme, Mr. Wesley; I have met with a provocation too great to bear. This\r\nvillain, Grimaldi, an Italian servant, has drunk nearly the whole\r\nof my Cyprus wine, the only wine that agrees with me, and several\r\ndozens of which I had provided for myself. But I am determined to be\r\nrevenged. The rascal shall be tied hand and foot, and be carried to\r\nthe man-of-war; for I never forgive.” “Then,” said Wesley with great\r\ncalmness, “then I hope, sir, you never sin.” Oglethorpe was confounded,\r\nhis vengeance was gone, he put his hand into his pocket, pulled out a\r\nbunch of keys, and threw them at Grimaldi, saying, “There, villain!\r\ntake my keys, and behave better for the future.”[157]\r\n\r\nThe voyage to Georgia was not without danger. On the 17th of January,\r\nthe sea broke over the ship, and, shaking it from stem to stern,\r\nbrought down the mainyard upon the decks, and dashed through the cabin\r\nwindows. Six days after, an immense wave vaulted over Wesley’s head,\r\nand drenched him to the skin. Two days later, the winds roared, and\r\nthe ship rocked to and fro with the utmost violence. The sea sparkled\r\nand smoked as if on fire, and the air literally blazed with lightning.\r\nThe mainsail was torn to tatters, and the companion swept away.[158]\r\nJust at the time this occurred, the Moravians were engaged in their\r\nevening service, and were singing a psalm of praise. As usual, Wesley\r\nwas with them. The English passengers began screaming; but the Germans\r\ncalmly continued singing. Wesley was struck with this, and asked one\r\nof them, after the service was concluded, “Were you not afraid?” He\r\nanswered, “I thank God, no.” Wesley asked again, “But were not your\r\nwomen and children afraid?” “No,” replied the Moravian, “our women and\r\nchildren are not afraid to die.” From the Moravians Wesley went among\r\nthe terror-struck English, and pointed out the difference between him\r\nthat feareth God and him that feareth Him not; and then concludes his\r\naccount of the storm by saying, “This was the most glorious day which\r\nI had ever seen.” Eleven days after, on February 5, 1736, they safely\r\ncast anchor in the Savannah river, and were welcomed by the firing\r\nof cannon, and by all the freeholders, constables, and tithingmen,\r\npresenting arms; while Oglethorpe’s first act was to give orders to\r\nprovide materials to build a church.[159]\r\n\r\nSavannah was now a town of about forty houses,[160] standing on a flat\r\nbluff, rising forty or fifty feet above the crescent river flowing at\r\nits base. On the eastern side of the town was a swamp, on the west a\r\nwood, and on the south a forest of pines, fourteen miles in length. The\r\nprincipal buildings were a courthouse, which served also for a church,\r\na log-built prison, a storehouse, a public mill for grinding corn,\r\nand a residence for the trustees’ steward. All the houses were of the\r\nsame size. There were still standing the four beautiful pines, under\r\nwhich Oglethorpe encamped when he landed with the first settlers, and\r\nwhich for nearly a twelvemonth he used as a sleeping place. At the\r\ndistance of about half a mile was a small Indian town, in which large\r\nnumbers of the Creek nation were occasionally accustomed to assemble.\r\nThe climate was exceedingly salubrious, the land rich, and the water\r\ngood.[161] Every male emigrant was allowed a watch coat, a musket, a\r\nbayonet, a hatchet, a hammer, a hand saw, a shovel, a hoe, a gimlet,\r\na knife, an iron pot, a pair of pothooks, and a frying-pan: also for\r\nhis maintenance, during the first year, 312 lbs. of beef or pork, 104\r\nof rice, 104 of Indian corn or peas, 104 of meal, one pint of strong\r\nbeer per day, 52 quarts of molasses, 16 lbs. of cheese, 12 of butter,\r\neight oz. of spice, 12 lbs. of sugar, four gallons of vinegar, 24 lbs.\r\nof salt, 12 quarts of lamp oil, one lb. of cotton thread, and 12 lbs of\r\nsoap. Proportionate allowances were made to women and children.[162]\r\nSuch facts will help the reader to imagine the kind of home and society\r\nwhich Wesley had in Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe only other towns in Georgia, even when Wesley came back to England,\r\nwere Frederica, in St. Simon’s Island, one hundred miles south of\r\nSavannah; Darien, the settlement of the Scotch Highlanders, at a\r\ndistance of about eighty miles; New Ebenezer, consisting of sixty huts,\r\nnineteen miles; Highgate and Hampstead, with fourteen families, four\r\nor five miles southwest, and Thunderbolt, with three families, six\r\nmiles southeast. Such were the English settlements in Georgia. All the\r\nrest of that large territory was woods, swamps, and prairies, the home\r\nof savage Indians, and of savage beasts. The Georgian Indians had no\r\nliterature, no religion, and no civil government. Every one did what\r\nwas right in his own eyes; and, if his neighbour felt aggrieved, he\r\nwould warily do his best to shoot him, scalp him, or cut off his ears.\r\nAll of them, except perhaps the Choctaws, were gluttons, drunkards,\r\nthieves, and liars; implacable, unmerciful, murderers of fathers,\r\nmurderers of mothers, murderers of their own children. Husbands,\r\nstrictly speaking, the women had none, for the men left their so called\r\nwives at pleasure; and the wives, in return for such desertion, would\r\ncut the throats of all the children they had had by their faithless\r\nswains. The Choctaws possessed a large extent of land, eight or nine\r\nhundred miles west of Savannah, had many well inhabited towns, and six\r\nthousand warriors. The Chicasaws, dwelling among meadows, springs, and\r\nrivers, six or seven hundred miles in the interior, had ten towns, and\r\nabout nine hundred fighting men,—all of them eating, drinking, and\r\nsmoking almost day and night, extremely indolent except in war, and\r\ntorturing and burning their prisoners with the most fiendish cruelty.\r\nThe Cherokees lived in a mountainous, fruitful, and pleasant country,\r\nthree or four hundred miles from Savannah, had fifty-two towns, and\r\nabove three thousand men of war. The Uchees had only one small town,\r\nnear two hundred miles distant from the Savannah settlement, and were\r\nhated by most and despised by all the other Indian tribes, for their\r\ncowardice and superlative diligence in thieving. The Creeks were\r\nlocated at a distance of about four hundred miles, had a well watered\r\ncountry, and fifteen hundred fighting men, and, of all the Indians,\r\nwere the most infected with the insatiate love of drink, as well\r\nas other European vices. In such a country John Wesley lived, from\r\nFebruary 5, 1736, to December 2, 1737.\r\n\r\nOne of the first to meet Wesley on the shores of Georgia was the well\r\nknown Moravian elder, August Gottlieb Spangenberg. Wesley asked his\r\nadvice how to act in his new sphere of labour. Spangenberg replied,\r\n“My brother, I must first ask you one or two questions. Have you the\r\nwitness within yourself? Does the Spirit of God bear witness with\r\nyour spirit, that you are a child of God?” Wesley was surprised at\r\nsuch questions. They were new to him. He was at a loss how to answer.\r\nSpangenberg continued, “Do you know Jesus Christ?” This was easier,\r\nand Wesley answered, “I know He is the Saviour of the world.” “True,”\r\nsaid Spangenberg; “but do you know He has saved _you_?” Wesley was\r\nagain perplexed, but answered, “I hope He has died to save me.”\r\nSpangenberg only added, “Do you know yourself?” Wesley replied, “I\r\ndo.” An odd conversation, leaving Spangenberg in doubt respecting the\r\nreal conversion of the Oxford priest, and leading Wesley to think of\r\ndoctrines which took him more than the next two years to understand.\r\n\r\nNine days after his arrival, Wesley and his friends were visited by\r\nTomo-Chichi (whom Oglethorpe had brought to England some time before)\r\nand half-a-dozen other Indians. Informed of their arrival, the young\r\nclergymen met them in their gowns and cassocks. The chief bid them\r\nwelcome, said he would assemble the great men of his nation, and\r\nexpressed a wish that they would teach his children; while his wife\r\ngave them a jar of milk, as emblematic of her wish that they might feed\r\nthe Indians with milk, for they were but children, and a jar of honey,\r\nwith the hope that the missionaries would be sweet to them.[163]\r\n\r\nIngham and Charles Wesley went off with Oglethorpe to lay out the town\r\nof Frederica; and Wesley and Delamotte, having no house of their own to\r\nlive in, lodged, during the first month, with Spangenberg, Nitschmann,\r\nand other Moravian friends. Thus, from morning to night, were they\r\nmixed up with these godly people, and had ample opportunity to observe\r\ntheir spirit and behaviour. Wesley writes: “They were always employed,\r\nalways cheerful themselves, and in good humour with one another;\r\nthey had put away all anger, and strife, and wrath, and bitterness,\r\nand clamour, and evil speaking; they walked worthy of the vocation\r\nwherewith they were called, and adorned the gospel of our Lord in all\r\nthings.” Wesley was present at the election and ordination of Anton\r\nSeifart[164] as a bishop for Georgia, the simplicity and solemnity\r\nof the service making him almost forget the seventeen hundred years\r\nbetween, and imagine himself in one of those assemblies where form and\r\nstate were not, but Paul the tentmaker or Peter the fisherman presided,\r\nwith the demonstration of the Spirit and of power. Who can estimate the\r\ninfluence of such intercourse in moulding the subsequent character and\r\nlife of this inquiring missionary?\r\n\r\nMr. Quincy, Wesley’s predecessor, having now removed to Carolina,\r\nWesley took possession of the wood-built rectory, and, on March 7th,\r\ncommenced his ministry at Savannah by preaching a sermon from 1\r\nCorinthians xiii. 3, in which he introduced two death-bed scenes,—that\r\nof his father at Epworth, and another which he had witnessed at\r\nSavannah, and which was “a spectacle worthy to be seen of God and\r\nangels and men.”[165] He officiated at nine in the morning, at twelve,\r\nand again in the afternoon;[166] and announced his design to administer\r\nthe sacrament on every Sunday and on every holiday.\r\n\r\nA few days subsequent to this, writing to his mother, he remarked:—“We\r\nare likely to stay here some months. The place is pleasant beyond\r\nimagination, and exceeding healthful. I have not had a moment’s illness\r\nof any kind since I set my foot upon the continent; nor do I know any\r\nmore than one of my seven hundred parishioners who is sick at this\r\ntime. Many of them indeed are, I believe, very angry already; for a\r\ngentleman, no longer ago than last night (March 17), made a ball; but\r\nthe public prayers happening to begin about the same time, the church\r\nwas full, and the ballroom so empty that the entertainment could not\r\ngo forward. I should be heartily glad if any poor and religious men or\r\nwomen of Epworth or Wroote would come over to me. General Oglethorpe\r\nwould give them land enough, and provisions gratis, till they could\r\nlive on the produce of it.”[167]\r\n\r\nWesley, in this letter, evidently considers the whole of the Georgian\r\nsettlements as his parish; for, so far from Savannah having at this\r\ntime a population of seven hundred souls, there was scarcely that\r\nnumber in the whole of the settlements put together. Georgia was his\r\nparish; for, Mr. Quincy being gone, he was the only minister of the\r\nChurch of England inducted into ministerial work in the Georgian\r\nterritory. Charles Wesley was Oglethorpe’s secretary; and though\r\nBenjamin Ingham had gone with a few colonists to where Frederica was to\r\nstand, Frederica itself as yet did not exist. Besides, Ingham’s visit\r\nwas intended to be but temporary, his mind being fully fixed upon a\r\nmission to the Indians. Indeed, this was Wesley’s purpose also. Their\r\nonly object in quitting England was, not to preach to the colonists,\r\nbut to the Indians; and the reason why Wesley had begun to preach to\r\nthe English at Savannah was because Mr. Quincy, the minister of the\r\nEnglish, had left the colony, and they were now as sheep without a\r\nshepherd; and also because, through the French on the one hand and the\r\nSpaniards on the other, the Indians were at present in great confusion,\r\nand had become so excited by French and Spanish plots and treachery\r\nthat it was not only dangerous to go among them, but, as Tomo-Chichi\r\ntold Wesley and his friends at the interview already mentioned, they\r\nseemed determined not to hear “the great word” which the white man had\r\nto teach.[168] In these two facts we find the reason, and the only\r\nreason, why Wesley’s object in going to Georgia was not fulfilled; and\r\nwhy, instead of preaching to the Indians in the woods, he spent his\r\ntime in preaching to the English at Savannah.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of Wesley’s ministry was auspicious. A fortnight after\r\npreaching his first sermon, he wrote to his brother Charles as follows:\r\n“I have hitherto no opposition at all; all is smooth, and fair, and\r\npromising. Many seem to be awakened; all are full of respect and\r\ncommendation. We cannot see any cloud gathering. But this calm cannot\r\nlast: storms must come hither, too; and let them come, when we are\r\nready to meet them.”[169]\r\n\r\nWesley had lived so long in the tempest of opposition that it is no\r\nwonder he felt it strange to find himself in the midst of an unbroken\r\ncalm, surrounded by nothing but “respect and commendation.” This was a\r\nnew experience, but it was soon ended.\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley and Ingham were already in hot water at Frederica, and\r\nthe latter hurried off to Savannah for advice. It was only three weeks\r\nsince Wesley had there commenced his ministry; yet he had already\r\nestablished daily morning and evening public prayers, and a weekly\r\ncommunion; he had also formed a society, which met on Wednesday,\r\nFriday, and Sunday nights, to read and pray and sing psalms together;\r\nand Delamotte had begun to teach a few orphan children.[170] This was\r\na vigorous beginning, but now Wesley and Delamotte had to hasten to\r\nFrederica, leaving Ingham to supply their place in the best way he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nCharles had been baptizing children by trine immersion, and\r\nendeavouring to reconcile scolding women. Some of these termagants\r\nhad prejudiced Oglethorpe against him, and the poor secretary was now\r\ntreated with coldness, and even charged with mutiny. A woman, whose\r\nhusband had been put into confinement, blamed him for being the cause\r\nof it, and threatened to be revenged upon him, by “exposing his d——d\r\nhypocrisy and his prayers four times a day by beat of drum.”[171] While\r\nall the others were provided with boards to sleep upon, he was left to\r\nsleep upon the ground. His few well-wishers became afraid to speak to\r\nhim, and even his washerwoman refused in future to wash his linen.\r\n\r\nWesley and Delamotte left Savannah on April 4, and returned on April\r\n20; having spent ten days on the voyage, and six in settling the\r\nmiserable squabbles that had sprung up among the palmetto huts of\r\nFrederica.\r\n\r\nOn the day of his arrival, Wesley wrote to Oglethorpe as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “SAVANNAH, _April 20, 1736_.\r\n\r\n    “SAVANNAH never was so dear to me as now. I found so little\r\n    either of the form or power of godliness at Frederica, that I\r\n    am sincerely glad I am removed from it. There is none of those\r\n    who did run well whom I pity more than Mrs. Hawkins.[172] Her\r\n    treating me in such a manner would indeed have little affected\r\n    me, had my own interests only been concerned. I have been used\r\n    to be betrayed, scorned, and insulted, by those I had most\r\n    laboured to serve. But when I reflect on her condition, my\r\n    heart bleeds for her.”\r\n\r\nWesley then refers to the accusation against his brother, to the effect\r\nthat, by the frequency of his public prayers, he prevented the men\r\nattending to their proper work, and interrupted the progress of the\r\ntown and colony. He shows the absurdity of this, by stating that, both\r\nat Frederica and Savannah, not more than seven minutes were spent in\r\nreading the public morning and evening prayers. Fourteen minutes daily,\r\nin two public services, could hardly be considered an unreasonable\r\ntaxation of the people’s time. Wesley writes: “These cannot be termed\r\nlong prayers: no Christian assembly ever used shorter.” And then he\r\nnaively informs Oglethorpe that these short prayers had no repetitions\r\nin them! We should think not![173]\r\n\r\nWithin a month after his return to Savannah, Wesley began to carry\r\nout his high church principles. He refused to baptize a child of Mr.\r\nParker’s, second bailiff of the town, because the parents objected to\r\nits being dipped. On Sundays, he divided the public prayers, according\r\nto the original appointment of the Church; reading the morning service\r\nat five; the communion office and a sermon at eleven; and the evening\r\nservice at three. He also commenced visiting his parishioners in order,\r\nfrom house to house, setting apart for this purpose three hours every\r\nday.\r\n\r\nHe had no sooner begun, however, than his brother, wearied with his\r\nlife at Frederica, and full of abhorrence at the false-heartedness of\r\nthe people,[174] unexpectedly presented himself at Savannah. Places\r\nwere exchanged, and John and Delamotte instantly started off to the\r\nforsaken flock. They arrived at Frederica on May 22nd, and remained\r\nuntil June 23rd. During this brief visit, Wesley read the commendatory\r\nprayer over Mrs. Germain, at the point of death; made Mr. Lassel’s\r\nwill; arranged a small society-meeting, like that which had been\r\norganised at Savannah; and reproved an officer of a man-of-war for\r\nswearing. One of his congregation said to him: “I like nothing you do;\r\nall your sermons are satires upon particular persons. Besides, we are\r\nProtestants: but as for you, we cannot tell what religion you are of.\r\nWe never heard of such a religion before; we know not what to make of\r\nit. And then your private behaviour: all the quarrels that have been\r\nhere since your arrival have been because of you; and there is neither\r\nman nor woman in the town who minds a word you say.” The next day\r\nWesley returned to Savannah.\r\n\r\nHe was no sooner back than a large party of Indians came, including\r\nseveral chiefs and an interpreter, with whom he had several interviews.\r\nHe now hoped that a door was opened for the fulfilment of his intention\r\nto be a missionary among the heathen; but when he informed Oglethorpe\r\nof his purpose, the general objected, on the ground that there was\r\ngreat danger of his being taken or killed by the French, and that it\r\nwas inexpedient to leave Savannah without a minister. Wesley answered\r\nthat, though the trustees of Georgia had appointed him to the office of\r\nminister of Savannah, this was done without his solicitation, desire,\r\nor knowledge; and that he should not continue longer than until his way\r\nwas opened to go among the Indians. And so the matter ended.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of July, after spending a little more than five months\r\nin Georgia, his brother Charles embarked for England. At the same\r\ntime, Wesley went again to ill-natured Frederica, where he spent the\r\nnext twelve weeks. Here he read, with Delamotte, Bishop Beveridge’s\r\n“_Pandectæ Canonum Conciliorum_,” and became more convinced than ever\r\nthat both particular and general councils may err. He set up a small\r\nlibrary; and as several Germans, through not understanding the English\r\ntongue, were unable to join in the public service, he agreed to meet\r\nthem every day at noon, in his own house, where, in their own language,\r\nhe expounded to them a chapter of the New Testament, and prayed with\r\nthem. Finding, however, that his prospects of doing good at Frederica\r\nbecame less and less, he returned to Savannah on the 31st of October,\r\nwhere he continued until the beginning of 1737.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Wesley’s friends in England did not forget him. The\r\nfollowing was from his old acquaintance, Mr. Morgan, and is now for the\r\nfirst time given to the public.\r\n\r\n    “OXON, _November 27, 1735_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SIR,— ... Be pleased to let Mr. Ingham know that I\r\n    intend going to Yorkshire, if not hindered by my father. God\r\n    has made Mr. Dickison the instrument of awakening his landlord\r\n    and landlady. I read to them at Mr. Fox’s an hour every other\r\n    day, in the Bishop of Man’s Catechism. Mr. Fox and his wife,\r\n    especially the former, are most zealous Christians; and are\r\n    earnestly bent on going to Georgia. So is Mr. Dickison, who\r\n    is ‘an Israelite indeed in whom there is no guile.’ I do not\r\n    doubt but we shall be able to send you a colony of thorough\r\n    good Christians. I have undertaken the care of Bocardo. I go\r\n    there three days in the week, and Mr. Broughton a fourth. I\r\n    read every Sunday night to a cheerful number of Christians at\r\n    Mr. Fox’s. I could say a great deal respecting our meetings,\r\n    etc.; but I am obliged to steal even this time from the holy\r\n    Scriptures, in which I find more and more comfort every day.\r\n    Indeed, the Lord’s kingdom increaseth apace. My love to your\r\n    brother, and Mr. Ingham, and Mr. Delamotte; and best respects\r\n    to Mr. Oglethorpe. I should be very glad if you could spare me\r\n    some of your prayers, or anything else which may be of service\r\n    to me.\r\n\r\n    “I am, your brother in Christ Jesus,\r\n    “RICHARD MORGAN.\r\n\r\n    “To the Rev. Mr. John Wesley, in Georgia.”\r\n\r\nAnother unpublished letter lies before us, written by Sir John Thorold,\r\nand breathing a most Christian spirit. Omitting what is purely\r\nsentimental, we give the following extracts:—\r\n\r\n    “LONDON, ST. JAMES’S PALACE, _May 24, 1736_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SIR,—I am unwilling to lose the opportunity of writing\r\n    to you, by Capt. Thompson, and inquiring after the welfare of\r\n    yourself, your brother, Mr. Ingham, Mr. Delamotte, and the\r\n    whole colony of Georgia. I have read the journal of your voyage\r\n    to that new settlement, and can, with pleasure, discern the\r\n    footsteps of Divine Providence towards you.... Our dear friend\r\n    Mr. Broughton is curate at the Tower, and has undertaken to\r\n    preach to the poor prisoners in Ludgate every Tuesday in the\r\n    afternoon. Mr. Whitefield and Mr. Hervey propose to enter into\r\n    holy orders this next ordination. May they become burning and\r\n    shining lights in the Church! Sir John Phillips has been, for\r\n    several weeks, hindered from attending the societies, by reason\r\n    of sickness and infirmities. He piously allows Mr. Whitefield\r\n    £20 per annum. Several of Mr. Broughton’s late parishioners at\r\n    Cowley forget not the assembling of themselves together. Your\r\n    friends at Oxford continue to exhort and edify one another.\r\n    Tell me what progress you make in spiritualizing your flock;\r\n    and what probability there is of the Lord opening the door of\r\n    faith to the Indians.... May the God of love keep you all knit\r\n    together in the bond of charity, and may you at last receive a\r\n    beautiful crown at the Lord’s hand, and enter amongst angels\r\n    and archangels, to sing everlasting songs of praise to the Lord\r\n    Almighty. I desire your prayers for me and mine.\r\n\r\n    “J. THOROLD.”\r\n\r\nThe next was from James Hutton:—\r\n\r\n    “_September 3, 1736._\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SIR,—I am this day twenty-one years old. Mr. Whitefield\r\n    has taken orders, and is in town to supply Mr. Broughton’s\r\n    places at the Tower and Ludgate prison. Mr. Broughton reads\r\n    prayers every night to a religious society that meet in Wapping\r\n    chapel. Mr. Morgan is obliged by his father’s orders to study\r\n    physic at Leyden, where the name of Wesley stinks as well as\r\n    at Oxford. I had the happiness of seeing your good mother,\r\n    who came to town, in her way from Gainsborough, to Mr. Hall\r\n    first, and thence very soon to Tiverton. Mr. Law visited her\r\n    at Gainsborough, and again at London. Your mother desired her\r\n    blessing to you, and would have wrote, but had no time. She\r\n    prayed for you and blessed you. If all matters relating to\r\n    receiving your fellowship are not exact, write fresh ones,\r\n    and send over. Take care to inquire carefully and strictly\r\n    concerning the mission of the Moravian bishop. I will make what\r\n    inquiries I can. A great deal depends upon the validity of\r\n    ordinations.”[175]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Hervey at Oxford wrote:—“I am still a most weak\r\ncorrupt creature. But, blessed be the unmerited mercy of God, and\r\nthanks be to your never-to-be-forgotten example, that I am what I am!\r\nYou have been both a father and a friend to me. I heartily thank you,\r\nas for all other favours, so especially for teaching me Hebrew.”[176]\r\n\r\nWilliam Chapman, a student of Pembroke College, wrote as follows:—“Your\r\nkind concern and repeated endeavours for my spiritual good, while\r\nat Oxford, will not suffer me to think that you have utterly lost\r\nall remembrance of me. I sit every evening with Mr. Hervey, that\r\ngreat champion of the Lord of hosts, and read five times a week to\r\na religious society in St. Ebbs’ parish. God and the angels be with\r\nyou!”[177]\r\n\r\nWesley, before leaving England, had begun to read the mystics, and\r\non November 23, 1736, addressed a long letter to his brother Samuel,\r\nshowing that, though he had been in danger of embracing their\r\nbewildering heresies, he had now abandoned them. He writes:—\r\n\r\n    “I think the rock on which I had the nearest made shipwreck of\r\n    the faith was the writings of the mystics: under which term I\r\n    comprehend all, and only those, who slight any of the means of\r\n    grace. I have drawn up a short scheme of their doctrines, and\r\n    beg your thoughts upon it, as soon as you can conveniently.\r\n    Give me them as particularly, fully, and strongly as your time\r\n    will permit. They may be of consequence, not only to all this\r\n    province, but to nations of Christians yet unborn.\r\n\r\n    “‘All means are not necessary for all men: therefore each\r\n    person must use such means, and such only, as he finds\r\n    necessary for him. When the end is attained the means cease.’\r\n\r\n    “‘Men utterly divested of free will, of self-love, and\r\n    self-activity, are entered into the passive state, and enjoy\r\n    such a contemplation as is not only above faith, but above\r\n    sight—such as is entirely free from images, thoughts, and\r\n    discourse, and never interrupted by sins of infirmity, or\r\n    voluntary distractions. They have absolutely renounced their\r\n    reason and understanding; else they could not be guided by a\r\n    Divine light. They seek no clear or particular knowledge of\r\n    anything, but only an obscure, general knowledge, which is far\r\n    better.’\r\n\r\n    “‘Having thus attained the end, the means must cease. Hope is\r\n    swallowed up in love. Sight, or something more than sight,\r\n    takes the place of faith. All particular virtues they possess\r\n    in the essence, and therefore need not the distinct exercise\r\n    of them. They work likewise all good works essentially, not\r\n    accidentally, and use all outward means, only as they are moved\r\n    thereto.’\r\n\r\n    “‘Public prayer, or any forms, they need not; for they pray\r\n    without ceasing. Sensible devotion in any prayer they despise;\r\n    it being a great hindrance to perfection. The Scripture\r\n    they need not read; for it is only His letter, with whom\r\n    they converse face to face. Neither do they need the Lord’s\r\n    supper; for they never cease to _remember_ Christ in the most\r\n    acceptable manner.’”\r\n\r\nSuch was the mystified balderdash which Wesley had been in danger of\r\nadopting. He concludes his letter thus:—\r\n\r\n    “May God deliver you and yours from all error, and all\r\n    unholiness! My prayers will never, I trust, be wanting for you.\r\n    I am, dear brother, my sister’s and your\r\n\r\n    “Most affectionate brother,\r\n    “JOHN WESLEY.”[178]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year 1736, Wesley and Delamotte set out, on foot,\r\nto Cowpen, missed their way, walked through a cypress swamp, with the\r\nwater breast high, and slept on the ground in their wet clothes, which\r\nduring the night were frozen, and in the morning were white as snow.\r\nThey then started for Frederica, fell short of provisions, used bear’s\r\nflesh, and proved it to be wholesome. Arriving on January 5, 1737, they\r\nfound the people, as they expected, cold and heartless. Wesley’s life\r\nwas repeatedly threatened; and, after spending twenty more days in this\r\nunhappy place, he departed from Frederica for ever. In his passage to\r\nSavannah he read a volume containing the works of Nicholas Machiavel,\r\nand formed the deliberate opinion, “that if all the other doctrines of\r\ndevils, which have been committed to writing, were collected together\r\nin one volume, it would fall short of this; and that should a prince\r\nform himself by this book, so calmly recommending hypocrisy, treachery,\r\nlying, robbery, oppression, adultery, whoredom, and murder of all\r\nkinds, Domitian or Nero would be an angel of light compared to that\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nWesley had now been fifty-two weeks in America, twenty-four of which\r\nhe had spent at Savannah, and the rest at Frederica and at other\r\nplaces between the two. He remained forty-six weeks longer. How was he\r\noccupied? And what were his troubles?\r\n\r\nDelamotte was teaching between thirty and forty children at Savannah\r\nto read, write, and cast accounts, and Wesley catechized them every\r\nSaturday and Sunday afternoon. Every sabbath he had three public\r\nservices, at five in the morning, twelve at mid-day, and three in the\r\nafternoon; and then at night as many of his parishioners as desired it\r\nmet at his house, with whom he spent an hour in prayer, singing, and\r\nmutual exhortation. A similar meeting was held in the same place every\r\nWednesday night, and selecter ones on all the other evenings of the\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nThere being no immediate prospect of commencing a mission among the\r\nheathen, Wesley, Delamotte, and Ingham consulted together, and agreed\r\nthat the last mentioned should return to England; and accordingly,\r\nafter spending exactly fifty-five weeks in Georgia, he embarked for\r\nhome, having literally done next to nothing either for the colonists or\r\nthe Indians, with the exception of composing, in Dr. Byrom’s shorthand,\r\na catalogue of half the words in the Indian language,[179] in a house\r\nbuilt for him near the Indian town, a few miles from Savannah. The\r\nchief object of sending Ingham to England was to obtain more help for\r\nthe colonists. In a letter dated February 16, 1737, and addressed to a\r\nfriend in Lincoln College, Oxford, Wesley writes:—\r\n\r\n    “There is great need that God should put it into the hearts of\r\n    some, to come over to us, and labour with us in His harvest.\r\n    But I should not desire any to come unless on the same views\r\n    and conditions with us; without any temporal wages, other than\r\n    food and raiment, the plain conveniences of life. For one or\r\n    more, in whom was this mind, there would be full employment in\r\n    the province: either in assisting Mr. Delamotte or me, while we\r\n    were present here; or in supplying our places when abroad; or\r\n    in visiting the poor people in the smaller settlements as well\r\n    as at Frederica, all of whom are as sheep without a shepherd.\r\n\r\n    “By these labours of love might any that desired it be trained\r\n    up for the harder task of preaching the gospel to the heathen.\r\n    The difficulties he must then encounter God only knows;\r\n    probably martyrdom would conclude them. But those we have\r\n    hitherto met with have been small. Persecution, you know, is\r\n    the portion of every follower of Christ, wherever his lot is\r\n    cast; but it has hitherto extended no farther than words with\r\n    regard to us, unless in one or two inconsiderable instances.\r\n    Still, every man that would come hither ought to be willing and\r\n    ready to embrace the severer kinds of it.”[180]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Oglethorpe’s troubles had begun. From a letter which Wesley\r\nwrote to him, on February 24, 1737, we learn that Sir Robert Walpole\r\nhad turned against the general, and parliament had resolved to make\r\na strict scrutiny into Georgian affairs. The trustees had charged\r\nOglethorpe with misapplying moneys, and with abusing his entrusted\r\npower. Wesley adds: “Perhaps in some things you have shown you are but\r\na man: perhaps I myself may have a little to complain of: but oh what\r\na train of benefits have I received to lay in the balance against it!\r\nI bless God that ever you was born. I acknowledge His exceeding mercy\r\nin casting me into your hands. I own your generous kindness all the\r\ntime we were at sea. I am indebted to you for a thousand favours here.\r\nThough all men should revile you, yet will not I.”[181]\r\n\r\nSinister rumours were circulated in reference to Wesley, as well as\r\nOglethorpe. Hence the following hitherto unpublished letter, endorsed\r\nby Wesley thus:—“The Trustees’ Letter, June 17, 1737, fully acquitting\r\nme:”—\r\n\r\n    “_Trustees of Georgia to the Rev. J. Wesley._\r\n\r\n    “GEORGIA OFFICE, _June 15, 1737_.\r\n\r\n    “SIR,—The Rev. Mr. Burton has this day laid before the trustees\r\n    a letter from you to them, dated Savannah, March 4, 1737,\r\n    wherein you express a concern that they should receive an\r\n    accusation of your embezzling any part of their goods, and\r\n    likewise a desire to know the name of your accuser.\r\n\r\n    “The trustees have ordered me to assure you, that they are very\r\n    much surprised at any apprehensions you have of such accusation\r\n    being brought before them. No complaint of any kind has been\r\n    laid before them relating to you. They have never as a board,\r\n    nor has any of them privately, heard of one; nor have they the\r\n    least suspicion of any ground for one. They would not (if they\r\n    had received any) form a judgment of you without acquainting\r\n    you with the accusation, and the name of the accuser. At\r\n    the same time, they believe you will think it reasonable to\r\n    let them know who has informed you that any such accusation\r\n    has been brought before them, and that, for the future, you\r\n    will not believe nor listen to any private informations or\r\n    insinuations, that must make you uneasy, and may lead you to\r\n    distrust the justice of the trustees, and the regard they have\r\n    for you.\r\n\r\n    “The trustees are very sensible of the great importance of\r\n    the work you have engaged in; and they hope God will prosper\r\n    the undertaking, and support you in it; for they have much at\r\n    heart, not only the success of the colony in general, but the\r\n    progress of piety among the people, as well as the conversion\r\n    of the Indians. They are very glad to find that Mr. Causton\r\n    has seconded your endeavours to suppress vice and immorality,\r\n    and that a reformation gains ground, as you observe it does.\r\n    The trustees will take into consideration your application in\r\n    favour of Robert Haws, and have a regard to it.\r\n\r\n    “I am, sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n    “BENJAMIN MARTIN, _Secretary_.”\r\n\r\nThe following letter, also now first published, refers to the same\r\nsubject, besides containing other information which we hope will be\r\nfound not devoid of interest. It was addressed to “The Rev. Mr. John\r\nWesley, at Savannah, in Georgia:”—\r\n\r\n    “OSSET, _October 19, 1737_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR BROTHER,—By your silence one would suspect that you\r\n    were offended at my last letter. Am I your enemy because I\r\n    tell you the truth? But perhaps I was too severe. Forgive me\r\n    then. However, I am sure that, by soaring too high in your own\r\n    imaginations, you have had a great downfall in your spiritual\r\n    progress. Be lowly, therefore, in your own eyes. Humble\r\n    yourself before the Lord, and He will lift you up. I do assure\r\n    you it is out of pure love, and with concern, that I write. I\r\n    earnestly wish your soul’s welfare. O pray for mine also. The\r\n    Lord preserve you!\r\n\r\n    “Could you, think you, live upon the income of your fellowship?\r\n    If you can, do. The trustees are indeed very willing to support\r\n    you, and they take it ill that anybody should say you have been\r\n    too expensive. But the Bishop of London (as I have heard),\r\n    and some others, have been offended at your expenses. And not\r\n    indeed altogether without reason, because you declared at your\r\n    leaving England that you should want scarcely anything. I just\r\n    give you these hints. Pray for direction, and then act as you\r\n    judge best.\r\n\r\n    “Charles is so reserved: I know little about him: he neither\r\n    writes to me, nor comes to see me: what he intends is best\r\n    known to himself. Mr. Hutton’s family go on exceedingly well.\r\n    Your friend Mr. Morgan (I hear) either has, or is about\r\n    publishing a book, to prove that every one baptized with water\r\n    is regenerate. All friends at Oxford go on well. Mr. Kinchin,\r\n    Mr. Hutchins, Mr. Washington, Bell, Turney, Hervey, Watson,\r\n    are all zealous. Mr. Atkinson labours under severe trials in\r\n    Westmoreland; but is steady, and sincere, and an excellent\r\n    Christian. Dick Smith is weak, but not utterly gone. Mr.\r\n    Robson, and Grieves, are but indifferent: the latter is married\r\n    to a widow, and teaching school at Northampton. Mr. Thompson,\r\n    of Queen’s, has declared his resolution of following Christ.\r\n\r\n    “Remember me to Mr. Wallis, Mark Hind, and the Davison family,\r\n    Mrs. Gilbert Mears, Mr. Campbell, Mr. and Mrs. Burnside, Mr.\r\n    and Mrs. Williamson.\r\n\r\n    “Yours in Christ,\r\n    “BENJAMIN INGHAM.”\r\n\r\nWesley’s ideas of religion, at this period, may be gathered from the\r\nfollowing extracts from a letter, dated “Savannah, March 28, 1737,” and\r\naddressed to “William Wogan, Esq., in Spring Gardens, London.”[182]\r\n\r\n    “I entirely agree with you, that religion is love, and peace,\r\n    and joy in the Holy Ghost; that, as it is the happiest, so\r\n    it is the cheerfulest thing in the world; that it is utterly\r\n    inconsistent with moroseness, sourness, severity, and indeed\r\n    with whatever is not according to the softness, sweetness, and\r\n    gentleness of Christ Jesus. I believe it is equally contrary\r\n    to all preciseness, stiffness, affectation, and unnecessary\r\n    singularity. I allow, too, that prudence, as well as zeal, is\r\n    of the utmost importance in the Christian life. But I do not\r\n    yet see any possible case wherein trifling conversation can be\r\n    an instance of it. In the following scriptures I take all such\r\n    to be flatly forbidden: Matt. xii. 36; Eph. v. 4, and iv. 29;\r\n    Col. iv. 6.\r\n\r\n    “That I shall be laughed at for this, I know; so was my Master.\r\n    I am not for a stern, austere manner of conversing. No: let all\r\n    the cheerfulness of faith be there, all the joyfulness of hope,\r\n    all the amiable sweetness—the winning easiness of love. If we\r\n    must have art, ‘_Hic mihi erunt artes_.’”\r\n\r\nAgain, in another letter, written to Mrs. Chapman a day later, he says:—\r\n\r\n    “You seem to apprehend that I believe religion to be\r\n    inconsistent with cheerfulness, and with a social friendly\r\n    temper. So far from it, that I am convinced, as true religion\r\n    cannot be without cheerfulness, so steady cheerfulness cannot\r\n    be without true religion. I am equally convinced that religion\r\n    has nothing sour, austere, unsociable, unfriendly in it; but\r\n    on the contrary, implies the most winning sweetness, the most\r\n    amiable softness and gentleness. Are you for having as much\r\n    cheerfulness as you can? So am I. Do you endeavour to keep\r\n    alive your taste for all the truly innocent pleasures of life?\r\n    So do I. Do you refuse no pleasure but what is a hindrance to\r\n    some greater good, or has a tendency to some evil? It is my\r\n    very rule. In particular, I pursue this rule in eating, which\r\n    I seldom do without much pleasure. I know it is the will of\r\n    God, that I should enjoy every pleasure that leads to my taking\r\n    pleasure in Him, and in such a measure as most leads to it. We\r\n    are to do nothing but what, directly or indirectly, leads to\r\n    our holiness; and to do every such thing with this design, and\r\n    in such a measure as may most promote it.\r\n\r\n    “I am not mad, my dear friend, for asserting these to be the\r\n    words of truth and soberness; neither are any of those, either\r\n    in England or here, who have hitherto attempted to follow\r\n    me. I am and must be an example to my flock; not indeed in\r\n    my prudential rules, but, in some measure, in my spirit and\r\n    life and conversation. Yet all of them are, in your sense of\r\n    the word, unlearned, and most of them of low understanding;\r\n    and still not one of them has been, as yet, in any case of\r\n    conscience which was not solved. As to the nice distinctions\r\n    you speak of, it is you, my friend, who are lost in them.\r\n    We have no need of nice distinctions; for I exhort all, and\r\n    dispute with none. I feed my brethren in Christ, as He giveth\r\n    me power, with the pure, unmixed milk of the word; and those\r\n    who are as little children receive it, not as the word of man,\r\n    but as the word of God.”[183]\r\n\r\nThese are important letters, as tending to refute the commonly received\r\nopinion, that, at this period of his history, Wesley was morose, sour,\r\ngloomy, and in fact thought that cheerfulness was inconsistent with\r\nreligion. His views and some of his practices might seem to many to be\r\npeculiar; but he was a cheerful and happy man, even amid the vigils,\r\nfastings, and solitudes of Georgia. Some of his views were novel, but\r\nthey were not incompatible with happiness. He writes: “When I first\r\nlanded at Savannah, a gentlewoman said, ‘I assure you, sir, you will\r\nsee as _well dressed_ a congregation on Sunday as most you have seen\r\nin London.’ I did so; and soon after I took occasion to expound those\r\nscriptures which relate to dress; and all the time that I afterward\r\nministered at Savannah, I saw neither gold in the church, nor costly\r\napparel, but the congregation in general was almost constantly clothed\r\nin plain clean linen or woollen.”[184] This wears an aspect of\r\nanchorite severity, but still Wesley and his plain-robed followers were\r\nhappy.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1737, Wesley began to learn the Spanish language, in order to\r\nconverse with his Jewish parishioners. Easter being in the same month,\r\nhe “had every day in this great and holy week a sermon and the holy\r\ncommunion.” Finding that a clergyman in Carolina had been marrying some\r\nof his (Wesley’s) parishioners, without either banns or licence, he set\r\nout for Charlestown to put a stop to such proceedings. Mr. Garden, the\r\nBishop of London’s commissary, assured him he would take care no such\r\nirregularity should be committed for the future. At Garden’s request,\r\nWesley preached a sermon on, “whatsoever is born of God overcometh the\r\nworld”; which led a man of education and character to object—“Why if\r\nthis be Christianity, a Christian must have more courage than Alexander\r\nthe Great.”\r\n\r\nReturning to Savannah, in the month of May, Wesley found one of his\r\ncongregation, who had been exemplarily religious, turned a deist; and\r\nexpressed the opinion that bad a religion as Popery is, no religion is\r\nworse; and that a baptized infidel is twofold worse than even a bigoted\r\npapist. This was only one of Wesley’s trials. A wicked woman, whom he\r\nhad offended, decoyed him into her house, threw him down, and, with her\r\nscissors, cut off from one side of his head the whole of those long\r\nlocks of auburn hair, which he had been accustomed to keep in the most\r\nperfect order. After this, he preached at Savannah with his hair long\r\non one side and short on the other, those sitting on the side which\r\nhad been cut observing, “What a cropped head of hair the young parson\r\nhas.”[185]\r\n\r\nAt Whitsuntide, four of his scholars, after being instructed daily\r\nfor several weeks, were admitted to the Lord’s table, and many of the\r\nother children evinced a remarkable seriousness in their behaviour\r\nand conversation. This was doubtless a cause of great joy both to\r\nWesley and his friend Delamotte, each of whom taught a school, and,\r\nlike all schoolmasters, met with discouragements. A part of the boys\r\nin Delamotte’s school wore stockings and shoes, and the others not.\r\nThe former ridiculed the latter. Delamotte tried to put a stop to this\r\nuncourteous banter, but told Wesley he had failed. Wesley replied, “I\r\nthink I can cure it. If you will take charge of my school next week I\r\nwill take charge of yours, and will try.” The exchange was made, and on\r\nMonday morning Wesley went into school barefoot. The children seemed\r\nsurprised, but without any reference to past jeerings Wesley kept them\r\nat their work. Before the week was ended, the shoeless ones began to\r\ngather courage; and some of the others, seeing their minister and\r\nmaster come without shoes and stockings, began to copy his example,\r\nand thus the evil was effectually cured.”[186]\r\n\r\nIn the early summer of 1737, Whitefield wrote to Wesley, telling him\r\nof his success in England. A young country lad had brought him a peck\r\nof apples seven miles upon his back, as a token of gratitude for the\r\nbenefit he had derived from Whitefield’s ministry, and had such a sense\r\nof the Divine presence that he walked, for the most part, with his hat\r\noff his head. God was also moving on the hearts of some young ladies.\r\nWhitefield continues:—\r\n\r\n    “The devil, I find, has a particular spite against weekly\r\n    communion; but I am in hope we shall have the sacrament\r\n    administered every Sunday at the cathedral. It would have been\r\n    mentioned to the bishop ere now, but Oxford friends advised to\r\n    defer it till next summer.\r\n\r\n    “But now I have mentioned the bishop: alas! how should I\r\n    tremble to tell you how I have been continually disturbed with\r\n    thoughts, that I, a worm taken from a common public-house,\r\n    should, ere I die, be one myself. Your earnest prayers, surely,\r\n    will not be wanting for me, that I may not split on that most\r\n    dangerous of all rocks—worldly ambition. Parsonages, I believe,\r\n    are providing for me; but I trust Satan will never catch me by\r\n    pluralities, or induce me to take upon me anything inconsistent\r\n    with the duty of a disciple of Jesus Christ. I hope our friends\r\n    all continue steadfast and zealous at Oxford. My love to the\r\n    young merchant, whose example I hope we shall all be enabled\r\n    to follow, if God requires our assistance in Georgia. O may\r\n    you go on and prosper, and, in the strength of God, make the\r\n    devil’s kingdom shake about his ears! I received benefit by\r\n    your father’s ‘Advice to a Young Clergyman.’”[187]\r\n\r\nWhitefield’s dream about being made a bishop is amusing; and yet\r\nProvidence and grace made him greater than a bishop.\r\n\r\nWesley still felt intensely anxious respecting the heathen. In July he\r\nmet a Frenchman, who had lived several months among the Chicasaws, and\r\nwrote to Dr. Humphreys as follows:—[188]\r\n\r\n    “Concerning the conversion of the heathen, where is the seed\r\n    sown, the _sanguis martyrum_? Do we hear of any who have sealed\r\n    the faith with their blood in all this vast continent? Or do\r\n    we read of any church flourishing in any age or nation without\r\n    this seed first sown there? Give me leave, sir, to speak my\r\n    thoughts freely. When God shall put it into the hearts of some\r\n    of His servants, whom He hath already delivered from earthly\r\n    hopes and fears, to join hand in hand in this labour of love;\r\n    when out of these He shall have chosen one or more, to magnify\r\n    Him in the sight of the heathen by dying, not with a stoical\r\n    or Indian indifference, but blessing and praying for their\r\n    murderers, and praising God in the midst of flame with joy\r\n    unspeakable and full of glory, then the rest, waxing bold by\r\n    their sufferings, shall go forth in the name of the Lord God,\r\n    and by the power of His might cast down every high thing that\r\n    exalteth itself against the faith of Christ. Then shall ye see\r\n    Satan, the grand ruler of this New World, as lightning fall\r\n    from heaven!”\r\n\r\nOh for missionaries like these! Wesley’s notions are right. Men going\r\nmerely because others send them, or men going merely to obtain a\r\nlivelihood, are not the men to convert the inhabitants of lands like\r\nAfrica, India, Japan, and China. To make an impression there, men must\r\nbe animated with the martyrs’ spirit. Church history, including the\r\nhistory of missions, affords abundant proof of this. Mere duty-doing\r\nministers are bad enough in England, but they are vastly worse when\r\namong the heathen. Money spent upon them there is worse than wasted;\r\nfor their cold perfunctory labours produce, upon the whole, a bad\r\neffect instead of good. The greatest boon the church could now receive\r\nfrom the hands of God would be a multiplication of ministers and\r\nmissionaries like those which Wesley was sighing for in Georgia.\r\n\r\nFrom Wesley’s private manuscript journal, we learn that in July, by\r\ngoing from house to house, he took a census of his parishioners, and\r\ncomputed that there were in Savannah 518 inhabitants, of whom 149\r\nwere under sixteen years of age. Frederica was without a minister,\r\nthough three hundred acres of land had been granted by the trustees\r\nfor a church establishment in that unhappy town.[189] Other places\r\nwith scanty populations were equally destitute. New Ebenezer had the\r\nMoravians; and Darien had Mr. M’Leod, a serious, resolute, and pious\r\nPresbyterian: but this seems to have been all the ministerial agency\r\nexisting in Georgia. Hence the following letter, addressed by Wesley to\r\nhis friends at Oxford:—\r\n\r\n    “SAVANNAH, _September 8, 1737_.\r\n\r\n    “... Long since, I begun to visit my parishioners in order,\r\n    from house to house; but I could not go on two days longer. The\r\n    sick were increasing so fast as to require all the time I had\r\n    to spare—from one to five in the afternoon. Nor is even that\r\n    enough to see them all, as I would do, daily. In Frederica and\r\n    all the smaller settlements here are above five hundred sheep\r\n    almost without a shepherd. What a single man can do is neither\r\n    seen nor felt. Where are ye who are very zealous for the Lord\r\n    of hosts? Who will rise up with me against the wicked? Whose\r\n    spirit is moved within him to prepare himself for publishing\r\n    glad tidings to those on whom the Sun of Righteousness never\r\n    yet arose? Do you ask what you shall have? Why, all you desire:\r\n    food to eat, raiment to put on, a place where to lay your head,\r\n    and a crown of life that fadeth not away! Do you seek means\r\n    of building up yourselves in the knowledge and love of God? I\r\n    know of no place under heaven where there are more than in this\r\n    place. Does your heart burn within you to turn many others to\r\n    righteousness? Behold, the whole land, thousands of thousands\r\n    are before you! I will resign to any of you all or any part of\r\n    my charge. Choose what seemeth good in your own eyes. There are\r\n    within these walls children of all ages and dispositions. Who\r\n    will bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,\r\n    till they are meet to be preachers of righteousness? Here are\r\n    adults from the farthest parts of Europe, and Asia, and the\r\n    inmost kingdoms of Africa; add to these the known and unknown\r\n    nations of this vast continent, and you will indeed have a\r\n    great multitude which no man can number.”[190]\r\n\r\nWhile Wesley was thus longing for help, events were transpiring, by\r\nwhich he himself within three months was driven out of Georgia, and\r\nobliged to return to England. This was the closing scene in Wesley’s\r\nmissionary life, and though a painful one it must not be shirked. All\r\nthe facts in the writer’s possession shall be given, and the reader\r\nshall have materials to form his own opinion. The chief actors in the\r\nscene, besides Wesley himself, were Sophia Christiana Hopkey, Thomas\r\nCauston, and William Williamson.\r\n\r\nCauston was one of the first company of emigrants, and landed in\r\nGeorgia with Oglethorpe, in February, 1733. He was a man of no\r\nsubstance, and his character was not as good as it might have been.\r\nIn fact, he left England in disgrace, having practised a fraud upon\r\nthe public revenue. He was naturally proud, covetous, cunning,\r\nand deceitful. By his clever rascality he wriggled himself into\r\nOglethorpe’s favour, and, on the arrival of the few emigrant gaol-birds\r\nin the Savannah river, was appointed a sort of dictator of the infant\r\nsettlement, and had charge of the stores which the trustees sent over\r\nfor the use of the colonists. We have already seen that, even when\r\nWesley left for England at the end of the year 1737, the inhabitants of\r\nSavannah were not more than 518 in number, of whom only 369 were adult\r\nmales and females. This was no large kingdom; but Thomas Causton was\r\na large man, because he was at the head of it. Indeed, the molehill\r\nempire seems to have magnified itself to the utmost extent possible, by\r\nthe introduction of law, the establishment of courts, the appointment\r\nof officers, the election of juries, and the adoption of everything\r\nelse within its power which was likely to make it a pompous minikin\r\nminiature of the great system of government at home. Causton was “chief\r\nmagistrate,” and of course a “chief” had subordinates under him. There\r\nwas a recorder, also a bailiff. There were constables, and tithingmen,\r\nand other great functionaries, all armed with solemn authority to\r\nrule, govern, and keep in order, first themselves, and then about five\r\nhundred men, women, and children, including John Wesley the Oxford\r\npriest, and Charles Delamotte the merchant master of almost a ragged\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n    “The ocean is in tempest tossed,\r\n    To waft a feather and to drown a fly.”\r\n\r\nOf all the great powers, however, in this log-built village of five\r\nhundred souls, Thomas Causton, in his own estimation, and in fact, was\r\ngreatest. The other Tom Thumb magistrates were ciphers in his august\r\npresence. Sometimes, indeed, he would ask their opinion in public on\r\nthe state matters of the great city of Savannah; but it was principally\r\nto have the pleasure of uttering an opinion of his own, directly\r\nopposite to theirs. Juries he threatened without the least compunction,\r\nand especially when their verdicts disagreed with his inclinations.\r\nAs his power increased, so did his pride, haughtiness, and cruelty.\r\nThe court in which this fraudulent refugee—we beg his pardon, this\r\n“chief magistrate”—expounded law and dispensed justice, was guarded\r\nby eight freeholders, with an officer to direct their movements, all\r\narmed with guns and bayonets. Seated, in such high dignity, and so far\r\nabove his fellows, upon the judicial bench, it was beneath his office\r\nto sit uncovered; and hence he almost invariably wore his hat, even\r\nwhen administering an oath. Should any foolish wight be bold enough\r\nto oppose, in the least degree, his arbitrary proceedings, the “chief\r\nmagistrate” at once threatened the impudent recusant with the stocks,\r\nthe whipping-post, and a lodging in the log-house prison. Even his\r\nfellow officials were treated with scant respect. In December, 1734,\r\nthe trustees sent a Mr. Gordon from England, to act as magistrate;\r\nbut Causton, not liking a compeer, refused him provisions from the\r\nstore, and he was obliged to leave. Indeed, Causton, who had sufficient\r\ncleverness to induce Oglethorpe, despite his roguery in England, to\r\nmake him magistrate in Savannah, seems to have used the same worldly\r\ncunning in allowing none to be his subordinates except those whom he\r\ncould, with the utmost ease, twist to his own purposes. Mr. Bailiff\r\nParker, mentioned in Wesley’s journal, had nothing to support himself\r\nand his large family, except what he earned by his daily labour as a\r\nsawyer. He was a man of no education, and was an absolute slave to\r\nliquor. Another bailiff was a man of the name of Daru, nearly seventy\r\nyears old, and crazed in both body and mind; and another was R.\r\nGilbert, who could neither read nor write. Causton’s despotic career\r\nwas of short duration. The same grand jury which found, under Causton’s\r\nguidance, ten bills against Wesley, immediately proceeded to examine\r\nthe official doings of their own illustrious “chief magistrate;” and\r\nfound charges against him, to the effect that he had grossly abused\r\nhis power as keeper of the public stores, and that he had hindered\r\npeople settling on the lands that the trustees had allotted them. These\r\nand other charges, dated September 1, 1737, were sent to England; and\r\nthe result was—Causton, in October, 1738, was turned out of all his\r\noffices, and the store was sold to pay the trustees’ debts; Causton’s\r\ncertified accounts were refused by the trustees as incorrect; William\r\nWilliamson was made recorder, and Henry Parker (the drunken uneducated\r\nsawyer above mentioned) was made first magistrate; and, finally,\r\nCauston, the great man who prosecuted Wesley, and drove him from\r\nGeorgia, settled down at Oxstead, three miles from Savannah; and there,\r\nwe hope, he lived a more honest life than he had done in England.[191]\r\n\r\nSophia Christiana Hopkey was the niece of Thomas Causton’s wife.\r\nWilliam Williamson, who became her husband, was a young adventurer, who\r\narrived in Georgia a short time after Wesley did.[192] And now, with\r\nthese explanations, let us look at the miserable business, which, in a\r\nlife of Wesley, cannot be omitted.\r\n\r\nWesley landed in Georgia on February 5, 1736, and seems at once to have\r\nbecome acquainted with Miss Hopkey. Oglethorpe, Charles Wesley, Ingham,\r\nand fifty other settlers set out immediately for Frederica. The young\r\nlady went with them; and, on March 22, Wesley wrote to his brother\r\nconcerning her as follows: “I conjure you, spare no time, no address\r\nor pains, to learn the true cause of the former distress of my friend.\r\nI much doubt you are in the right. God forbid that she should again,\r\nin like manner, miss the mark. Watch over her; keep her as much as\r\npossible. Write to me, how I ought to write to her.”[193]\r\n\r\nMiss Hopkey was a young lady of good sense, and elegant in person\r\nand manners. She was introduced to Wesley as a sincere inquirer\r\nafter salvation, and soon took every possible opportunity of being\r\nin his company, and requested him to assist her in studying French.\r\nOglethorpe also did his best to help on a courtship. Meanwhile, Wesley\r\nwas seized with fever, which confined him for nearly a week; and the\r\nyoung lady (who would hardly allow Delamotte to do anything for his\r\nfriend) attended him night and day. She even consulted Oglethorpe what\r\nkind of female dress Wesley liked the best, and therefore came always\r\ndressed in white, neatly and simply elegant. Young Delamotte began\r\nto be suspicious, and asked Wesley if he meant to marry Miss Hopkey.\r\nDelamotte’s question puzzled Wesley, but, perceiving that Delamotte was\r\nprejudiced against the lady, he waived an answer. The next step taken\r\nwas to consult David Nitschmann, the Moravian bishop. Nitschmann’s\r\nanswer was: “Marriage is not unlawful; but whether it is now expedient\r\nfor you, and whether this lady is a proper wife for you, ought to\r\nbe maturely weighed.” Wesley’s perplexity was increased, and he now\r\nresolved to submit the matter to the elders of the Moravian church.\r\nWhen he entered the house where they were met together, he found\r\nDelamotte in the midst of them. On naming his business, Nitschmann\r\nsaid: “We have considered your case; will you abide by our decision?”\r\nAfter some hesitation, Wesley replied, “I will.” “Then,” said\r\nNitschmann, “we advise you to proceed no further in the matter!” Wesley\r\nanswered, “The will of the Lord be done!” “From this time,” says Henry\r\nMoore, “he avoided everything that tended to continue the intimacy with\r\nMiss Hopkey, and behaved with the greatest caution towards her.”[194]\r\n\r\nThe whole of this is painfully ludicrous. Mr. Moore, in a manuscript\r\nletter before us, says that he had the account from Wesley’s own lips,\r\nand that he is not aware that it was ever given to any one except\r\nhimself. He adds that Dr. Coke knew nothing of it, and that Wesley\r\nrefrained from publishing the whole of the affair in his printed\r\njournal, _chiefly_ through tenderness to General Oglethorpe. It might\r\nbe so; but we greatly doubt the correctness of Moore’s assertion,\r\nthat, from the time Wesley consulted the Moravian elders, he “avoided\r\neverything that tended to continue the intimacy.” Wesley was in love,\r\nand, like all lovers, he did, not wicked, but foolish things. Let us\r\nlook at some other facts.\r\n\r\nAt this period, the summer of 1736, Wesley’s method of preaching, and\r\nhis manner of life, excited great attention in the small settlement\r\nof Savannah; and there were not a few who charged him with making the\r\npeople idle by summoning them so frequently to public prayers. His more\r\nthan ordinary friendship with Miss Hopkey was also a subject of common\r\nconversation.[195] He was looked upon as a Roman Catholic—(1) Because\r\nhe rigidly excluded all Dissenters from the holy communion, until they\r\nfirst gave up their faith and principles, and, like Richard Turner\r\nand his sons, submitted to be rebaptized by him; (2) Because Roman\r\nCatholics were received by him as saints; (3) Because he endeavoured\r\nto establish and enforce confession, penance, and mortification;\r\nmixed wine with water at the sacrament; and appointed deaconesses in\r\naccordance with what he called the Apostolic Constitutions.[196] He\r\nwas, in point of fact, a Puseyite, a hundred years before Dr. Pusey\r\nflourished.\r\n\r\nMiss Hopkey was put under his ghostly care. She was one of his early\r\nmorning congregation, and constantly went to his lodgings, in order\r\nto be further instructed.[197] He fell in love with her; and there\r\ncan be little doubt that he made proposals to marry her, and, if his\r\nown inclinations had been carried out, the marriage would have been\r\ncompleted.[198] The following extracts are taken from his unpublished\r\njournal.\r\n\r\n    1736. October 16.—Frederica. “Poor Miss Sophy was scarce the\r\n    shadow of what she was when I left her. I endeavoured to\r\n    convince her of it, but in vain. And to put it effectually out\r\n    of my power to do so, she was resolved to return to England\r\n    immediately. I tried to divert her from her fatal resolution\r\n    of going to England, and, after several fruitless attempts,\r\n    I at length prevailed. Nor was it long before she more than\r\n    recovered the ground she had lost.”\r\n\r\n    “October 25.—I took boat for Savannah with Miss Sophy.”\r\n\r\n    “In the beginning of December, I advised Miss Sophy to sup\r\n    earlier, and not immediately before she went to bed. She did\r\n    so, and on this little circumstance what an inconceivable train\r\n    of consequences depend. Not only—\r\n\r\n    ‘All the colour of my remaining life’\r\n\r\n    for her; but perhaps all my happiness too, in time and in\r\n    eternity.”\r\n\r\n    “February 5, 1737.—One of the most remarkable dispensations of\r\n    Providence towards me began to show itself this day. For many\r\n    days after, I could not at all judge which way the scale would\r\n    turn; nor was it fully determined till March 4th, on which day\r\n    God commanded me to pull out my right eye; and, by His grace,\r\n    I determined to do so: but, being slack in the execution, on\r\n    Saturday, March 12th, God being very merciful to me, my friend\r\n    performed what I could not.”\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of this? Two other extracts from the same journal\r\nwill show.\r\n\r\n    “March 7.—I walked with Mr. Causton to his country lot, and\r\n    plainly felt that, had God given me such a retirement with the\r\n    companion I desired, I should have forgot the work for which I\r\n    was born, and have set up my rest in this world.”\r\n\r\n\r\n    “March 8.—Miss Sophy engaged herself to Mr. Williamson, a\r\n    person not remarkable for handsomeness, neither for greatness,\r\n    neither for wit, or knowledge, or sense, and least of all for\r\n    religion; and on Saturday, March 12th” [four days after!] “they\r\n    were married at Purrysburg,—this being the day which completed\r\n    the year from my first speaking to her. What Thou doest, O God,\r\n    I know not now, but I shall know hereafter.”\r\n\r\nSuch is Wesley’s own statement. The disappointment was a most painful\r\nblow. Forty-nine years after, he wrote, in reference to this event, “I\r\nremember when I read these words in the church at Savannah, ‘Son of\r\nman, behold, I take from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke,’\r\nI was pierced through as with a sword, and could not utter a word more.\r\nBut our comfort is, He that made the heart can heal the heart.”[199] He\r\nalso wrote to his brother Samuel at the time, who replied, “I am sorry\r\nyou are disappointed in the match, because you are very unlikely to\r\nfind another.”[200]\r\n\r\nWith this evidence before us, it is difficult to give credence to Henry\r\nMoore’s assertion, “that Wesley never allowed himself to _determine_\r\non a marriage with Miss Hopkey.”[201] But in addition to all this,\r\nthere is the testimony of the young lady herself, contained in her\r\naffidavit, given to the Savannah court, and which Wesley inserts in\r\nthe private journal already mentioned. In that document she avers that\r\nshe was committed to the care of Mr. John Wesley, the missionary, by\r\nher relatives; that he proposed marriage to her; and that he further\r\nproposed that, as she might not like his present wandering way of life,\r\nhe would settle in Savannah. She adds that, about three days before\r\nshe married Williamson, she was visited by Wesley, who urged her to\r\ntell him whether she had not been overpersuaded or forced to agree to\r\nmarry Williamson by her friends, and whether such a marriage might not\r\nstill be prevented. He also added that, if there was anything in his\r\nway of life (by which she understood him to mean fastings and other\r\nmortifications), which she disliked, he would make all these things\r\neasy to her, in case she would consent to marry him.\r\n\r\nSuch is the substance of Sophy’s statement. How is it possible, in\r\nthe face of all this, to believe Henry Moore’s statement, that there\r\nwas no intimacy between Wesley and Miss Hopkey, from the time that he\r\nconsulted the Moravian elders?\r\n\r\nWe grudge the space that has been devoted to this subject; but perhaps\r\nthe following reasons will be accepted by the reader, as an apology for\r\nthe tax upon his patience.\r\n\r\n1. The matter, though trivial in itself, has been made important by\r\nthe conflicting statements of the biographers. Mr. Moore says Wesley\r\nnever came to the determination to marry her. Dr. Whitehead says he did\r\nintend to marry her. Southey agrees with Whitehead; Mr. Watson presumes\r\nthat Mr. Moore is a better authority than Dr. Whitehead; Mr. Jackson\r\nseems to think the same. We have given all the facts within our reach,\r\nand leave the reader to form his own opinion.\r\n\r\n2. Though the courtship of young people is an ordinary, commonplace\r\nsort of thing, inconceivably great events were dependent upon the\r\nresult of this. John Wesley was thirty-three years old, and was\r\nperfectly justified in seeking to obtain a wife; neither is there\r\nanything to be found fault with in his intercourse with Miss Hopkey,\r\nunless it was his silly simplicity in asking the opinion, if not\r\nconsent, of the Moravians. The young lady, also, was beautiful, and\r\naccomplished, and, to all human appearance, pious. Her uncle was a\r\nrespectable rascal; but that was no fault of hers. We know nothing to\r\nher prejudice before she became a wife, except that it might have been\r\nmore decorously prudent if she had allowed Delamotte to nurse Wesley\r\nin his fever instead of doing it, day and night, herself; and that\r\nthere was certainly an impetuous haste, not to be commended, in her\r\nmarrying Mr. Williamson only four days after he first proposed to her.\r\nExcepting this, the friendship, courtship, or whatever else the reader\r\nlikes to call it, between Wesley and his “poor Sophy” seems to have\r\nbeen sincere, pure, honourable, and, in the opinion of Oglethorpe, who\r\nwas not ill qualified to judge, desirable. But, supposing the courtship\r\nhad ended in marriage, is it likely that we should ever have heard of\r\nWesley at Bristol, Kingswood, Kennington Common, and Moorfields? Is\r\nit likely that there would ever have been any “United Societies of\r\nthe People called Methodists”? Should we have ever heard of either the\r\nMethodism of the past or present? Perhaps an equally great work might\r\nhave been witnessed; but the great Head of the church must have wrought\r\nit by other agencies and means; for had John Wesley married Sophia\r\nChristiana Hopkey, the probability is that, instead of returning to\r\nEngland and beginning the greatest religious revival of modern times,\r\nhe would have settled in Georgia, and, like another Xavier, have spent\r\na most spiritual and devoted life in converting Indian and other kinds\r\nof heathen. The results of such a life might have been glorious. Who\r\ncan tell what might have been its influence upon the civilisation and\r\nperpetuation of the nobly formed aboriginal inhabitants of the vast\r\nAmerican continent? Would America, in the decline of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, have been inhabited by European strangers, or by educated,\r\ncivilised, hardworking, prosperous descendants of the wild Indians\r\nof the woods? These are useless questions, because questions none of\r\nus can answer; but the mere suggestion of such points will serve to\r\nshow that Wesley’s courtship in Georgia was pregnant with infinite\r\nmomentousness. “The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the\r\nmultitude of isles be glad: clouds and darkness are round about Him;\r\nrighteousness and judgment are the habitation of His throne” (Ps.\r\nxcvii. 1, 2).\r\n\r\n3. Then a third reason, for dwelling at so great a length on Wesley’s\r\ncourtship, is, that the courtship was very improperly mixed up with the\r\nsubsequent troubles which led to his almost forceful departure from\r\nthe Georgian colony. But this brings us to the remainder of Wesley’s\r\nGeorgian history, which shall now be given as succinctly as possible.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that Wesley was an extreme ritualist. He himself,\r\nnearly a dozen years subsequent to his flight from Georgia, gives us a\r\nspecimen of his high church bigotry and intolerance. Having inserted in\r\nhis journal a beautiful letter written to him by John Martin Bolzius,\r\nhe, under the date of September, 1749, remarks: “What a truly Christian\r\npiety and simplicity breathe in these lines! And yet this very man,\r\nwhen I was at Savannah, did I refuse to admit to the Lord’s table,\r\nbecause he was not baptized; that is, not baptized by a minister who\r\nhad been episcopally ordained. Can any one carry high church zeal\r\nhigher than this? How well have I been since beaten with mine own\r\nstaff!”[202]\r\n\r\nWesley still paid pastoral attentions to Mrs. Williamson as one of his\r\nparishioners. Her not too accomplished husband took umbrage at this,\r\nand, eight days after her marriage, forbade her attending his place\r\nof worship, or ever to speak to him again.[203] Notwithstanding this\r\ninterdict, however, we find her on the 3rd of July at a sacramental\r\nservice, at the conclusion of which Wesley mentioned certain things\r\nwhich he thought reprovable in her behaviour. This made her extremely\r\nangry, and, three days later, Causton, accompanied by the bailiff\r\nand the recorder, came to demand an explanation. Wesley gave his\r\nvisitors to understand that, in the execution of his office, and\r\nacting without respect of persons, he might find it necessary to repel\r\none of Causton’s family from the holy communion. He further told the\r\n“chief magistrate” what the people of Savannah were saying against\r\nhis magisterial proceedings.[204] All this made the coming storm more\r\nthreatening.\r\n\r\nSome weeks elapsed; and then, on August 7, five months after her\r\nmarriage, Wesley refused to allow Mrs. Williamson to join in the\r\nLord’s supper. The next day, Mr. Recorder issued a warrant for the\r\napprehension of “John Wesley, clerk,” and commanding the constables\r\nand tithingmen to bring him before one of the bailiffs of Savannah,\r\nto answer the complaint of William Williamson for defaming his wife,\r\nand refusing to administer to her the sacrament of the Lord’s supper,\r\nin a public congregation, without cause; “by which the said William\r\nWilliamson was damaged one thousand pounds sterling.”\r\n\r\nWesley was arrested and brought before Mr. Bailiff Parker and Mr.\r\nRecorder Christie. His answer to the charge was, “that the giving or\r\nrefusing the Lord’s supper being a matter purely ecclesiastical, he\r\ncould not acknowledge their power to interrogate him concerning it.”\r\nThe bailiff told him he must appear at the next Savannah court; and\r\nWilliamson demanded bail for his appearance, but the officials ruled\r\nthat Wesley’s word was in itself sufficient.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, Causton called on Wesley, and demanded that he should\r\nsend to Mrs. Williamson, in writing, “the reasons for repelling her\r\nbefore the whole congregation.” Wesley complied, and wrote as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “_To Mrs. Sophia Williamson._\r\n\r\n    “At Mr. Causton’s request, I write once more. The rules whereby\r\n    I proceed are these:—\r\n\r\n    “‘So many as intend to be partakers of the holy communion shall\r\n    signify their names to the curate, at least some time the day\r\n    before.’ This you did not do.\r\n\r\n    “‘And if any of these have done any wrong to his neighbours, by\r\n    word or deed, so that the congregation be thereby offended, the\r\n    curate shall advertise him, that in anywise he presume not to\r\n    come to the Lord’s table until he hath openly declared himself\r\n    to have truly repented.’\r\n\r\n    “If you offer yourself at the Lord’s table on Sunday, I will\r\n    advertise you (as I have done more than once) wherein you have\r\n    done wrong. And when you have openly declared yourself to have\r\n    truly repented, I will administer to you the mysteries of God.\r\n\r\n    “_August 11, 1737._\r\n\r\n    “JOHN WESLEY.”\r\n\r\nOn receiving this, Causton began to read, to as many of the people\r\nas he could collect together, extracts from the letters which Wesley\r\nhad written to himself or to his niece, from the beginning of their\r\nacquaintance, adding comments of his own, to Wesley’s disadvantage.\r\nOthers of Causton’s family were assiduous in their endeavours to\r\nconvince their neighbours that Wesley had repelled Mrs. Williamson from\r\nthe communion because she had refused to marry him. In the midst of\r\nall this Wesley writes: “I sat still at home, and, I thank God, easy,\r\nhaving committed my cause to Him, and remembering His word, ‘Blessed is\r\nthe man that endureth temptation; for when he is tried he shall receive\r\nthe crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love\r\nHim.”[205]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Causton desired Mr. Burnside, the trustees’ secretary, to\r\nsign a certificate to the effect that Mrs. Williamson had been for\r\nten months past as constant a communicant as any other, and that she\r\nhad been of unblamable behaviour. Mr. Burnside said he could not sign\r\nit with a safe conscience, knowing it to be false. Upon which Causton\r\nseverely reproached him, and discharged him from his employment.\r\nHowever, a number of names were procured to the certificate, though,\r\nWesley adds, the first part of it was shamefully untrue, for Mrs.\r\nWilliamson had omitted communicating nine times in three months; in\r\nother words, had only communicated once a month instead of once a\r\nweek.[206]\r\n\r\nThe Savannah court was to sit on August 22, a fortnight after\r\nWesley’s arrest; and Causton employed his utmost power, and art, and\r\napplication, in prejudicing the persons who were to form the grand\r\njury. His table was free to the whole of them. Whatever they desired\r\nfrom the public stores was delivered to them. Old misunderstandings\r\nwere forgotten, and nothing was too much to be done or promised for men\r\nwho, a week before, were unable, from such a source, to procure even a\r\ncrust of bread.\r\n\r\nSix days previous to the opening of the court, Wesley, at the request\r\nof several of his communicants, read a short statement of the case,\r\nafter the evening prayers, in the open congregation.[207]\r\n\r\nAt length the great day of trial, in this Lilliputian kingdom, came.\r\nThe grand jury consisted of forty-four of the illustrious inhabitants,\r\nabout a fifth part of the adult male population of Savannah. One was\r\na Frenchman, ignorant of the English language; one a papist; one a\r\nprofessed infidel; three were Baptists; sixteen or seventeen others\r\nwere Dissenters; and of the rest, several had personal quarrels against\r\nWesley, and had openly vowed revenge.\r\n\r\nCauston gave a long and earnest charge to the jury, “to beware of\r\nspiritual tyranny, and to oppose the new, illegal authority which was\r\nusurped over their consciences.” Mrs. Williamson’s affidavit was read,\r\nthe substance of which has been already given, with the exception that,\r\nafter her marriage, Wesley took every opportunity to force upon her\r\nhis private discourse, and terrified her by telling her that her soul\r\nwould be in danger, if she did not spend her time, and converse with\r\nhim, in the same manner, as she did before her marriage.[208]\r\n\r\nCauston then delivered to the grand jury a paper, entitled “A List of\r\nGrievances,” pretending to show that the Rev. John Wesley “deviates\r\nfrom the principles and regulations of the Established Church in many\r\nparticulars inconsistent with the happiness and prosperity of this\r\ncolony,” as:—\r\n\r\n    “1. By inverting the order and method of the liturgy.\r\n\r\n    “2. By altering such passages as he thinks proper in the\r\n    version of the psalms, publicly authorised to be sung in the\r\n    church.\r\n\r\n    “3. By introducing into the church, and service at the altar,\r\n    compositions of psalms and hymns not inspected or authorised by\r\n    any proper judicature.\r\n\r\n    “4. By introducing novelties, such as dipping infants, etc., in\r\n    the sacrament of baptism, and refusing to baptize the children\r\n    of such as will not submit to his innovations.\r\n\r\n    “5. By restricting the benefits of the Lord’s supper to a\r\n    small number of persons, and refusing it to all others who\r\n    will not conform to a grievous set of penances, confessions,\r\n    mortifications, and constant attendance at early and late hours\r\n    of prayer, very inconsistent with the labours and employment of\r\n    this colony.\r\n\r\n    “6. By administering the sacrament of the Lord’s supper to\r\n    boys ignorant and unqualified; and that notwithstanding of\r\n    their parents and nearest friends remonstrating against it, and\r\n    accusing them of disobedience and other crimes.\r\n\r\n    “7. By refusing to administer the holy sacrament to well\r\n    disposed and well living persons, unless they should submit to\r\n    confessions and penances for crimes, which they utterly refuse,\r\n    and whereof no evidence is offered.\r\n\r\n    “8. By venting sundry uncharitable expressions of all who\r\n    differ from him; and not pronouncing the benediction in church,\r\n    until all the hearers, except his own communicants, are\r\n    withdrawn.\r\n\r\n    “9. By teaching wives and servants that they ought absolutely\r\n    to follow the course of mortifications, fastings, and diets,\r\n    and two sets of prayers prescribed by him; without any regard\r\n    to the interests of their private families, or the commands of\r\n    their respective husbands and masters.\r\n\r\n    “10. By refusing the Office of the Dead to such as did not\r\n    communicate with him, or by leaving out such parts of the\r\n    service as he thought proper.\r\n\r\n    “11. By searching into and meddling with the affairs of private\r\n    families, by means of servants and spies employed by him for\r\n    the purpose, whereby the peace both of public and private life\r\n    is much endangered.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “12. By calling himself ‘ordinary,’ and thereby claiming\r\n    a jurisdiction which is not due to him, and whereby we\r\n    should be precluded from access to redress by any superior\r\n    jurisdiction.”[209]\r\n\r\nHow did the grand jury deal with these charges?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, Mrs. Williamson was called, but acknowledged, in the\r\ncourse of her examination, that she had no objection to Wesley’s\r\nbehaviour previous to her marriage. After her, Mr. and Mrs. Causton\r\nwere examined; the former confessing that, if Wesley had asked his\r\nconsent to marry his niece, he would not have refused it.[210] Ten\r\nother witnesses were put into the box, and several of Wesley’s letters\r\nto Mrs. Williamson were read.[211]\r\n\r\nSome days were spent in sifting the business; and then, on September 1,\r\na majority of the jurymen agreed to the following indictments:—\r\n\r\n1. That, after the 12th of March last, the said John Wesley did several\r\ntimes privately force his conversation to Sophia Christiana Williamson,\r\ncontrary to the express desire and command of her husband; and did\r\nlikewise write and privately convey papers to her, thereby occasioning\r\nmuch uneasiness between her and her husband.\r\n\r\n2. That, on the 7th of August last, he refused the sacrament of the\r\nLord’s supper to Sophia Christiana Williamson, without any apparent\r\nreason, much to the disquiet of her mind, and to the great disgrace and\r\nhurt of her character.\r\n\r\n3. That he hath not, since his arrival in Savannah, emitted any public\r\ndeclaration of his adherence to the principles and regulations of the\r\nChurch of England.\r\n\r\n4. That, for many months past, he has divided on the Lord’s day the\r\norder of morning prayer, appointed to be used in the Church of England,\r\nby only reading the said morning prayer and the litany at five or six\r\no’clock, and wholly omitting the same between the hours of nine and\r\neleven o’clock, the customary time of public morning prayer.\r\n\r\n5. That, about the month of April, 1736, he refused to baptize,\r\notherwise than by dipping, the child of Henry Parker, unless the said\r\nHenry Parker and his wife would certify that the child was weak and\r\nnot able to bear dipping; and added to his refusal, that, unless the\r\nsaid parents would consent to have it dipped, it might die a heathen.\r\n\r\n6. That, notwithstanding he administered the sacrament of the Lord’s\r\nsupper to William Gough, about the month of March, 1736, he did, within\r\na month after, refuse the sacrament to the said William Gough, saying\r\nthat he had heard that William Gough was a Dissenter.\r\n\r\n7. That in June, 1736, he refused reading the Office of the Dead over\r\nthe body of Nathaniel Polhill, only because Nathaniel Polhill was not\r\nof his opinion; by means of which refusal the said Nathaniel Polhill\r\nwas interred without the appointed Office for the Burial of the Dead.\r\n\r\n8. That, on or about the 10th of August, 1737, he, in the presence of\r\nThomas Causton, presumptuously called himself “Ordinary of Savannah,”\r\nassuming thereby an authority which did not belong to him.\r\n\r\n9. That in Whitsun-week last he refused William Aglionby to stand\r\ngodfather to the child of Henry Marley, giving no other reason than\r\nthat the said William Aglionby had not been at the communion table with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n10. That, about the month of July last, he baptized the child of Thomas\r\nJones, having only one godfather and godmother, notwithstanding that\r\nJacob Matthews did offer to stand godfather.[212]\r\n\r\nSuch were the findings of the majority of the grand jury. The minority\r\nof twelve, including three constables and six tithingmen, drew up and\r\nsigned a document, and transmitted it “to the honourable the trustees\r\nfor Georgia,” to the following effect:—\r\n\r\n1. That they were thoroughly persuaded that the charges against Mr.\r\nWesley were an artifice of Mr. Causton’s, designed rather to blacken\r\nthe character of Mr. Wesley than to free the colony from religious\r\ntyranny, as he had alleged.\r\n\r\n2. That it did not appear that Mr. Wesley had either spoken in private\r\nor written to Mrs. Williamson since the day of her marriage, except one\r\nletter, which he wrote on the 5th of July, at the request of her uncle,\r\nas a pastor, to exhort and reprove her.\r\n\r\n3. That, though he did refuse the sacrament to Mrs. Williamson on the\r\n7th of August last, he did not assume to himself any authority contrary\r\nto law, for every person intending to communicate was bound to signify\r\nhis name to the curate, at least some time the day before; which\r\nMrs. Williamson did not do; although Mr. Wesley had often, in full\r\ncongregation, declared he did insist on a compliance with that rubric,\r\nand had before repelled divers persons for non-compliance therewith.\r\n\r\n4. That, though he had not in Savannah emitted any public declaration\r\nof his adherence to the principles and regulations of the Church of\r\nEngland, he had done this, in a stronger manner than by a formal\r\ndeclaration, by explaining and defending the three creeds, the\r\nthirty-nine articles, the whole Book of Common Prayer, and the\r\nhomilies; besides a formal declaration is not required, but from those\r\nwho have received institution and induction.\r\n\r\n5. That though he had divided, on the Lord’s day, the order of morning\r\nprayer, this was not contrary to any law in being.\r\n\r\n6. That his refusal to baptize Henry Parker’s child, otherwise than by\r\ndipping, was justified by the rubric.\r\n\r\n7. That, though he had refused the sacrament to William Gough, the said\r\nWilliam Gough (one of the twelve jurors who signed the document sent\r\nto the trustees) publicly declared that the refusal was no grievance\r\nto him, because Mr. Wesley had given him reasons with which he was\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n8. That, in reference to the alleged refusal to read the burial service\r\nover the body of Nathaniel Polhill, they had good reason to believe\r\nthat Mr. Wesley was at Frederica, or on his return thence, when Polhill\r\nwas interred; besides Polhill was an anabaptist, and desired, in his\r\nlifetime, that he might not be buried with the office of the Church of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n9. That they were in doubt about the indictment concerning Wesley\r\ncalling himself “Ordinary of Savannah,” not well knowing the meaning of\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\n10. That, though Mr. Wesley refused to allow William Aglionby to stand\r\ngodfather to the child of Henry Marley, and Jacob Matthews to stand\r\ngodfather to the child of Thomas Jones, he was sufficiently justified\r\nby the canons of the Church, because neither Aglionby nor Matthews had\r\ncertified Mr. Wesley that they had ever received the holy communion.\r\n\r\nSuch were the findings of his foes and of his friends: the only\r\ndifference, as to fact, between the majority of thirty-two and the\r\nminority of twelve, is that which relates to Mrs. Williamson and\r\nNathaniel Polhill. The minority declare that it is not true that Mr.\r\nWesley did _several times_ privately force his conversation to Sophia\r\nWilliamson after her marriage; and that they have good reason to\r\nbelieve that it is not true that he refused to read the burial service\r\nover Nathaniel Polhill, because, at the time of the burial, he was\r\nabsent from Savannah. All the other alleged facts are admitted, but are\r\nalso justified. How did Wesley meet the indictments?\r\n\r\nOn September 2, the day after they were presented and were read to\r\nthe people, he appeared in court, and spoke to this effect:—“As to\r\nnine of the ten indictments against me, I know this court can take no\r\ncognisance of them, they being matters of an ecclesiastical nature.\r\nBut that concerning my speaking and writing to Mrs. Williamson is of a\r\nsecular nature; and this, therefore, I desire may be tried here where\r\nthe facts complained of were committed.”[213]\r\n\r\nIn this Wesley was unquestionably right. His conduct as a priest of the\r\nChurch of England might be, as it doubtless was, arrogant, foolish,\r\noffensive, intolerant; but the petty magisterial court at Savannah had\r\nno more right to try him for his high church practices than an Old\r\nBailey judge and jury have to try the half-fledged papistical rectors,\r\ncurates, and incumbents, who are playing such fantastic tricks in the\r\nProtestant churches of old England at the present day. They had a right\r\nto try him on the matter mentioned by himself, inasmuch as it was\r\nalleged that Mrs. Williamson had been injured in her character, and, on\r\nthat account, her husband demanded damages to the extent of £1000.\r\n\r\nWesley was prepared to answer this indictment, and moved for an\r\nimmediate hearing; but the court evaded his request, and postponed the\r\nhearing to its next sitting. From September 1, when the indictments\r\nwere first presented, to the end of November, when Wesley made known\r\nhis intention to return to England, he seems to have attended not\r\nfewer than seven different sittings of the court, asking to be tried\r\non the charge affecting the character of Mrs. Williamson; but all to\r\nno purpose. The fact is, Mr. and Mrs. Williamson, after having stabbed\r\nhim, were about to set sail to England,[214] and their contemplated\r\nabsence was made a pretext for not proceeding with the trial. There\r\ncan be little doubt that the whole affair was as the twelve jurors\r\nbelieved, a device of Thomas Causton, to gratify his spite, and, by\r\nannoyances, to drive Wesley from the colony.\r\n\r\nSix days after the majority of the grand jury presented their\r\nindictments, Mr. Dixon, chaplain to a company of soldiers at Frederica,\r\ncalled on Wesley, and informed him that the magistrates of Savannah\r\nhad given him authority to perform ecclesiastical offices in the\r\ntown; and that he should begin to do so the day following, by reading\r\nprayers, preaching, and administering the Lord’s supper. Accordingly,\r\non September 8, the bell was rung, and Mr. Dixon read prayers and\r\npreached, in Wesley’s church, to Mr. Causton, Mr. and Mrs. Williamson,\r\nand about half-a-score other persons. He announced that he had intended\r\nto administer the holy communion, but some of his communicants were\r\nindisposed. He would, however, read prayers and preach every Thursday,\r\nand would administer baptism to as many children as might be brought\r\nfor that purpose. This was _ipso facto_ a setting aside of Wesley; or,\r\nat all events, it was an arbitrary appointment of another clergyman to\r\nfill his place.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday following, September 11, Wesley preached from, “It must\r\nneeds be that offences come;” and then proceeded to read a paper which\r\nhe had read before, on the day he began his ministry at Savannah, and\r\nin which he had apprised his congregation:—1. That he must admonish\r\nevery one of them, not only in public, but from house to house. 2. That\r\nhe could admit none to the holy communion without previous notice. 3.\r\nThat he should divide the morning service in compliance with the first\r\ndesign of the Church. 4. That he should obey the rubric by dipping in\r\nbaptism all children who were well able to endure it. 5. That he should\r\nadmit none who were not communicants to be sureties in baptism. 6. That\r\nthough, in general, he had all the authority which was entrusted to\r\nany one within the province, yet he was only a servant of the Church of\r\nEngland,—not a judge, and therefore obliged to keep the regulations of\r\nthat Church in all things.[215]\r\n\r\nOn succeeding Sundays, he read to the congregations the homilies, and\r\nthen began reading Dr. Rogers’s eight sermons, as an antidote against\r\nthe poison of infidelity. Up to the present, he had no intention of\r\nleaving the colony. Indeed, as lately as the 7th of June last, he had\r\nwritten to his sister Keziah, and had made her an offer to come and\r\nlive with him at Savannah;[216] but, as soon as it was known that\r\nWilliamson and his wife were about to start for England, Delamotte\r\nurged that Wesley ought to go as well, in order to prevent, or remove,\r\nthe misrepresentations which they were likely to make. This was on\r\nSeptember 9;[217] and, a month later, Wesley took counsel with his\r\nfriends on the same subject. They were unanimously of opinion “that he\r\nought to go, but not yet;” and accordingly he abandoned his purpose for\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he commenced three kinds of services which he had not before\r\nattempted. He offered to read prayers, and to expound the Scriptures,\r\nin French, every Saturday afternoon, to the French families settled\r\nat Highgate, five miles from Savannah, which offer was thankfully\r\naccepted. The French at Savannah heard of this, and requested he would\r\ndo the same for them, with which request he willingly complied. He also\r\nbegan to read prayers and expound in German, once a week, to the German\r\nvillagers of Hampstead.\r\n\r\nHis Sunday labour, during the few weeks that he yet remained in\r\nSavannah, was as follows:—1. English prayers from five o’clock to\r\nhalf-past six. 2. Italian prayers at nine. 3. A sermon and the holy\r\ncommunion, for the English, from half-past ten to about half-past\r\ntwelve. 4. The service for the French at one, including prayers,\r\npsalms, and Scripture exposition. 5. The catechizing of the children at\r\ntwo. 6. The third English service at three. 7. After this, a meeting in\r\nhis own house for reading, prayer, and praise. 8. At six, the Moravian\r\nservice began, which he was glad to attend, not to teach, but learn.\r\n\r\nThus things proceeded until November 22, when Causton sent for Wesley\r\nand showed him an affidavit, sworn on September 15, to the effect that\r\nhe had called Causton a liar and a villain; but, with characteristic\r\nduplicity, said he had not sent _this_ affidavit to the trustees,—a\r\nstatement, which, in fact, was both true and false, for although he\r\nhad not sent _this_ affidavit he had sent a _copy_ of it. Causton\r\nbitterly added, that the last court held in Savannah had reprimanded\r\nhim as “an enemy to and a hinderer of the public peace.” “Both,” says\r\nan eye-witness, “displayed warmth of temper; but Causton was most\r\nvehement. They parted with mutual civilities.”[218]\r\n\r\nThis caused Wesley to again consult his friends about the propriety of\r\nhis leaving the colony. He saw that at present there was no possibility\r\nof instructing the Indians; neither had he as yet found or heard of any\r\nIndians who had the least desire of being instructed. Thus the great\r\nreason of his leaving England was not realised. Then, as to Savannah,\r\nhe had never engaged himself, either by word or letter, to stay there a\r\nday longer than he should judge convenient. And, further, he now saw a\r\nprobability of doing more service to the unhappy colonists by going to\r\nEngland, than he could do by remaining in Georgia; for there he could,\r\nwithout fear or favour, report to the trustees the state in which the\r\ncolony was placed. All his friends agreed with him; and accordingly,\r\nnext morning, he called on Causton, and told him he “designed to set\r\nout for England immediately, and placarded an advertisement in the\r\ngreat square” of the unbuilt town to the same effect.\r\n\r\nSavannah was in great excitement. Causton had his partisans, and so had\r\nWesley his. Scandal was plentiful. Wesley’s congregations dwindled, and\r\nwere now extremely thin. Mr. Stephens, the secretary of the trustees at\r\nSavannah, relates[219] that, in November, he heard Wesley preach on “Is\r\nit lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar or not?” from which he discoursed\r\nlargely on the duties of magistrates, and on the obedience which was\r\ndue to them; setting forth how far it was consistent with Christian\r\nliberty for people to insist upon their rights, when they found\r\nthemselves oppressed by inferior magistrates exercising a discretionary\r\nauthority which exceeded their commission. Stephens adds, that the\r\ncongregation was very poor, and that he found that the magistrates\r\nand many of the principal inhabitants had of late wholly absented\r\nthemselves from church.\r\n\r\nOn November 20, Wesley preached from the text, “Jesus wept.” Stephens\r\nwrites: “He showed himself a good casuist; but his metaphysical\r\ndiscourse would have been better adapted to a learned audience than\r\nsuch a poor thin congregation as his, who stood in need of plain\r\ndoctrine.”\r\n\r\nOn November 27, he preached from Acts xx. 26, 27. Stephens, who was\r\npresent, says: “He enforced the practice of all Christian duties most\r\npathetically, which he was well qualified to do. Some people imagined,\r\nfrom the choice of the text, that he meant it as a sort of farewell\r\nsermon; but it did not appear so from any particular expressions\r\nemployed.”\r\n\r\nNo sooner was it known that Wesley meant to embark for England, than\r\nWilliamson issued an advertisement that he had brought an action\r\nagainst him for £1000 damages; and that if any one assisted his escape\r\nfrom the colony, he would prosecute such accomplice with the utmost\r\nrigour of the law.[220] The magistrates also sent for Wesley, and told\r\nhim he must not leave the province till he had answered the indictments\r\nagainst him. Wesley replied that he had already attended seven sessions\r\nof the court to answer them, and had not been permitted. They then\r\nrequested him to sign a kind of bond, engaging him, under a penalty of\r\n£50, to appear at their court when he should be required; and added\r\nthat Mr. Williamson also demanded that he should give bail to answer\r\nhis action. Wesley replied that he would give neither any bond, nor any\r\nbail at all; and so he left them. In the afternoon of the same day they\r\npublished an order requiring all the officers and sentinels to prevent\r\nhis leaving the province, and forbidding any person to assist him in\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nHe was now a prisoner at large, and the same evening, after public\r\nprayers, he set out in a boat for Purrysburg, distant about twenty\r\nmiles, and thus left Savannah and Georgia for ever.[221]\r\n\r\nArriving at Purrysburg early in the morning of December 3, Wesley\r\nand the four men who had assisted in his escape, and had rowed him\r\nto Purrysburg, set out on foot to Port Royal. Tramping their way\r\nthrough trackless forests, they came to a large swamp, around which\r\nthey wandered for three weary hours. Then they had to force their way\r\nthrough an almost impassable thicket. They had now been trudging from\r\nan hour before sunrise in the morning till nearly sunset at night, and\r\nhad not tasted food, except a gingerbread cake, which Wesley happened\r\nto have in his pocket. They were faint and weary, and no wonder.\r\nThrusting a stick into the ground, and finding its end moist, two of\r\nthem set to work digging with their hands, and, at about three feet\r\ndepth, obtained water. They thanked God, drank, and were refreshed. The\r\nmonth was December, and the night cold; but there was no complaining;\r\nand, having commended themselves to God, they lay down on the ground,\r\nclose together, and Wesley, at least, slept till near six in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday; but the bewildered fugitives started again,\r\nand after three more days of weary wandering reached Port Royal.\r\nDelamotte joined them on Thursday, December 8, when, taking a boat,\r\nthey all set sail for Charlestown. This was no comfortable steamer,\r\nbut a small watercraft, without covering, and impelled by oars. Four\r\ndays were spent in making the passage, the winds were contrary, and\r\ntheir provisions short; but, cold and hungry, they arrived in safety on\r\nTuesday, December 13.[222]\r\n\r\nWesley and Delamotte, with the exception of a few brief days, had not\r\nbeen parted for the last six-and-twenty months: but on December 22\r\nthe former set sail for England; the latter, for a season, was left\r\nbehind. One of Wesley’s fellow passengers was a young gentleman, who\r\nhad been one of his parishioners at Savannah; and another was Eleanor\r\nHayes, who became one of the first Methodists in London, and of whom an\r\ninteresting notice may be found in the _Methodist Magazine_ for 1867.\r\nIt was impossible for Wesley to live an idle life. During the voyage,\r\nhe began instructing two negro lads and the cabin-boy in the principles\r\nof the Christian religion. On Sundays, at least, he had morning and\r\nevening prayers. He finished his abridgment of De Renty’s Life; and he\r\nread and explained to a poor Frenchman a chapter in the New Testament\r\nevery morning. When in mid-ocean they encountered a terrific storm,\r\nwhich gave Wesley an opportunity of speaking faithfully to all on board\r\nabout their eternal interests. On February 1 they landed at Deal, the\r\nday after George Whitefield had set sail for the very settlement which\r\nWesley had been obliged to leave.\r\n\r\nDuring the passage Wesley had ample time for self-examination, and\r\nwrote as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “By the most infallible of proofs, inward feeling, I am\r\n    convinced—\r\n\r\n    “1. Of unbelief; having no such faith in Christ as will prevent\r\n    my heart being troubled.\r\n\r\n    “2. Of pride, throughout my life past; inasmuch as I thought I\r\n    had what I find I have not.\r\n\r\n    “3. Of gross irrecollection; inasmuch as in a storm I cry to\r\n    God every moment, in a calm not.\r\n\r\n    “4. Of levity and luxuriancy of spirit; appearing by my\r\n    speaking words not tending to edify, but most by my manner of\r\n    speaking of my enemies.”\r\n\r\nHe adds:—\r\n\r\n    “I went to America to convert the Indians; but oh, who shall\r\n    convert me? I have a fair summer religion. I can talk well;\r\n    but let death look me in the face, and my spirit is troubled.\r\n    I think, verily, if the gospel be true, I am safe: for I not\r\n    only have given, and do give, all my goods to feed the poor;\r\n    and not only give my body to be burned, drowned, or whatever\r\n    God shall appoint for me; but I follow after charity, if haply\r\n    I may attain it. I now believe the gospel is true. I show my\r\n    faith by my works,—by staking my all upon it. I would do so\r\n    again and again, a thousand times, if the choice were still to\r\n    make. Whoever sees me sees I would be a Christian. But in a\r\n    storm, I think, ‘What if the gospel be not true? Then thou art\r\n    of all men most foolish. For what hast thou given thy goods,\r\n    thy ease, thy friends, thy reputation, thy country, thy life?\r\n    For what art thou wandering over the face of the earth—a dream!\r\n    a cunningly devised fable?’ Oh, who will deliver me from this\r\n    fear of death? A wise man advised me some time since, ‘Be still\r\n    and go on.’ Perhaps this is best, to look upon it as my cross.”\r\n\r\nAfter landing in England, he penned another remarkable paper, which\r\nhas often been cited without a quotation of the notes he appended in\r\nafter years.[223] He asserts that when he went to America, to convert\r\nthe Indians, he was not himself converted; but in the appended note he\r\nadds, “I am not sure of this.” Neither are we. By his conscientious\r\nseverity in comparing himself with the standard of a perfect Christian,\r\nas contained in the New Testament, and by his imperfect and mystified\r\nviews of the scriptural plan of salvation, he might deprive himself of\r\nthe filial confidence and joy belonging to a child of God; but we dare\r\nnot affirm that he was a child of wrath because he was without the joy.\r\nOn the same principle, thousands of us would be children one day, but\r\nnot the next. Wesley’s assertion was too strong; in after life he felt\r\nit so; and those who quote it ought, in all fairness, to add what he\r\nhimself appended.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the same document he says of himself: “Alienated as\r\nI am from the life of God, I am a child of wrath, an heir of hell.” But\r\nthe note he attached to this, in subsequent years, is, “I believe not”;\r\nand if not a child of wrath, then in his opinion, and after mature\r\nreflection, he had a right to think himself a child of grace and an\r\nheir of heaven.\r\n\r\nAnother of his notes is: “I had even then the faith of a servant,\r\nthough not that of a son;” and that the reader may know what\r\ninterpretation to put upon such words, we give the following extract\r\nfrom one of Wesley’s own sermons:—\r\n\r\n    “But what is the faith which is properly saving? It is such a\r\n    Divine conviction of God, and the things of God, as, even in\r\n    its infant state, enables every one that possesses it to fear\r\n    God and work righteousness. And whosoever, in every nation,\r\n    believes thus far, is accepted of Him. He actually is, at that\r\n    very moment, in a state of acceptance. But he is at present\r\n    only a _servant_ of God, not properly a _son_. Meanwhile let\r\n    it be well observed that the wrath of God no longer abideth\r\n    on him. Nearly fifty years ago, when the preachers, commonly\r\n    called Methodists, began to preach that grand scriptural\r\n    doctrine, salvation by faith, they were not sufficiently\r\n    apprised of the difference between a servant and a child of\r\n    God. In consequence of this, they were apt to make sad the\r\n    hearts of those whom God had not made sad. For they frequently\r\n    asked those who feared God, ‘Do you know that your sins are\r\n    forgiven?’ And upon their answering ‘No,’ immediately replied,\r\n    ‘Then you are a child of the devil.’ No; that does not follow.\r\n    It might have been said (and it is all that can be said with\r\n    propriety), ‘Hitherto you are only a _servant_, you are not a\r\n    _child_ of God. You have already great reason to praise God\r\n    that He has called you to His honourable service. Fear not,\r\n    continue crying unto Him, and you shall see greater things than\r\n    these!’ And, indeed, unless the servants of God halt by the\r\n    way, they will receive the adoption of sons. They will receive\r\n    the _faith_ of the children of God, by His _revealing_ His only\r\n    begotten Son in their hearts. Thus, the faith of a child is,\r\n    properly and directly, a Divine conviction, whereby every child\r\n    of God is enabled to testify, ‘The life that I now live I live\r\n    by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for\r\n    me.’ And whosoever hath this, the Spirit of God witnesseth with\r\n    his spirit, that he is a child of God. This then it is, that\r\n    properly constitutes the difference between a servant of God\r\n    and a child of God.”[224]\r\n\r\nLet those who have been accustomed to cite Wesley’s hasty and\r\nincautious condemnation of himself, on his return from Georgia, read it\r\nagain in the light of his own appended notes, and in the light of this\r\nextract from a sermon written by himself nearly fifty years afterwards;\r\nand they will then have a more correct idea of Wesley’s religious state\r\nat Oxford and in America, and will also be better fitted to understand\r\nwhat is meant by what is called his conversion on the 24th of May,\r\n1738. This matter, however, must be resumed in its proper place.\r\n\r\nWesley, in Georgia, was accepted of God through Christ; but, to cite\r\nhis own words at the conclusion of his own condemnatory document, he\r\nwanted “a sure trust and confidence in God, that, through the merits of\r\nChrist, his sins were forgiven.” “I want,” says he, “that faith which\r\nnone can have without knowing that he hath it.”\r\n\r\nWesley, according to his own explanation, had long been in a _saved_\r\nstate (though he knew it not); but he was far from being perfect,\r\neither in spirit or behaviour. No man could be more sincere or earnest;\r\nbut it is hoped that few ministers of equal learning, wisdom, and\r\nsanctity make greater blunders than were made by him at Savannah. There\r\ncan be little doubt that he had ecclesiastical authority for most,\r\nif not all, his priestly practices; and so have the half papistical\r\npriests and ritualists of the present day. But as England now is right\r\nin resisting the introduction of rites and ceremonies, fasts and\r\nfeasts, confessions and penances, absolutions and interdicts, savouring\r\nmore of the man of sin than of the word of God,—so Savannah then was\r\nright in resisting similar innovations attempted to be introduced by\r\nthe extremely high church priest, fresh from the society of the Oxford\r\nMethodists. If we are right in denouncing _ritualism_ now, Savannah\r\nwas right in denouncing _ritualism_ then. If the thing is offensive\r\nand obnoxious here, it was equally offensive and obnoxious there;\r\nand if no other end had been answered by Wesley’s mission to America\r\nthan knocking out of him his high church nonsense, the good effected\r\nwould have been an ample compensation for two dangerous voyages of six\r\nthousand miles, and for all the discomforts of living two-and-twenty\r\nmonths, in a log-built hut, among almost homeless emigrants, who had\r\ntaken with them to the swamps and woods of Georgia more covetousness\r\nthan courtesy, more rudeness than rank, more quarrelsomeness than\r\nquietude, and more conceit than common sense.\r\n\r\nWesley has been blamed for repelling Mrs. Williamson from the\r\ncommunion; and if he had nothing more to allege against her than the\r\noffence that, since her marriage, she had come to sacrament once a\r\nmonth only, instead of once a week, he deserves to be blamed. It was a\r\nrash proceeding, utterly unwarranted; and both she and her husband did\r\nright in resisting it. So far we agree with Wesley’s censors; but we\r\ncannot agree with them in saying that the great, if not only, reason\r\nof his repelling her was revenge arising out of her refusal to marry\r\nhim. There is not a particle of evidence in proof of that. Five months\r\nhad elapsed since her marriage; and, again and again, during that\r\ninterval, he had administered to her the holy communion. The repulse\r\nwas, on his part, a strictly conscientious, not a revengeful act; but\r\nthough conscientious, it was, to say the least, mistaken, and deserves\r\ncensure instead of praise. Mr. Moore says that, about three months\r\nafter Mrs. Williamson’s marriage, Wesley saw things in her conduct\r\nwhich induced him to bless God for his deliverance in not marrying her,\r\nand that these things were noted in his private journal never printed.\r\nWe have not the slightest wish to defend the lady where she deserves\r\ncensure: but fairness compels us to say that we have seen the private\r\njournal; but neither in it, nor elsewhere, have we met with anything\r\ncharged against her more serious than what has been already mentioned\r\nin the present far too lengthy chapter. Dissimulation is the strongest\r\nword Wesley has used concerning her; and this is used in reference to\r\nsomething which happened three months after she was married, and of\r\nwhich no explanation is given.[225] Miss Hopkey, like Wesley himself,\r\nwas not so good as she might have been; but that is not a sufficient\r\nreason why Wesley’s biographers should insinuate, if not assert, that\r\nshe was worse than she really was.\r\n\r\nWesley’s mission to America seemed a failure! But was it so? When\r\nWhitefield arrived, he wrote: “The good Mr. John Wesley has done in\r\nAmerica is inexpressible. His name is very precious among the people;\r\nand he has laid a foundation that I hope neither men nor devils will\r\never be able to shake. Oh that I may follow him as he has followed\r\nChrist.”[226]\r\n\r\nWesley himself observes:—\r\n\r\n    “Many reasons I have to bless God for my having been carried\r\n    to America, contrary to all my preceding resolutions. Hereby,\r\n    I trust, He hath in some measure ‘_humbled me and proved me,\r\n    and shown me what was in my heart_.’ Hereby, I have been taught\r\n    to ‘_beware of men_.’ Hereby, God has given me to know many of\r\n    His servants, particularly those of the church of Herrnhuth.\r\n    Hereby, my passage is open to the writings of holy men, in\r\n    the German, Spanish, and Italian tongues. All in Georgia have\r\n    heard the word of God, and some have believed and begun to\r\n    run well. A few steps have been taken towards publishing the\r\n    glad tidings both to the African and American heathens. Many\r\n    children have learned how they ought to serve God, and to be\r\n    useful to their neighbour. And those whom it most concerns have\r\n    an opportunity of knowing the state of their infant colony,\r\n    and laying a firmer foundation of peace and happiness to many\r\n    generations.”[227]\r\n\r\nThese are no mean results to be realised in about two\r\nyears,—self-knowledge, caution, acquaintance with the church that was\r\nto help him to clearer views of the plan of salvation, the acquisition\r\nof three European languages, the unprecedented fact of preaching Christ\r\nto _all_ the widely scattered inhabitants of an English colony, steps\r\ntaken to evangelise negroes and Indians, many children religiously\r\neducated, and the way prepared for promoting the prosperity of Georgia\r\nto the end of time!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_WESLEY IN TRANSITION._ 1738.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1738 Age 35]\r\n\r\nWhitefield left England the day before Wesley reached it. He landed\r\nin Georgia on the 7th of May, 1738, and remained sixteen weeks; and\r\nthen set out again for his own country, where he arrived on November\r\n30. A flying visit, but not a fruitless one. Having been ordained\r\nby Bishop Benson in June, 1736, he began his unparalleled preaching\r\ncareer with a sermon in the church of St. Mary de Crypt, Gloucester,\r\nwhere he had been baptized, and where he first received the sacrament\r\nof the Lord’s supper. Some of his congregation mocked, but most were\r\npowerfully impressed. The bishop was informed that the sermon had\r\ndriven fifteen persons mad; the worthy prelate hoped the madness would\r\nbe abiding. Whitefield was a stripling of twenty-one; but wherever he\r\nwent crowds flocked to hear him. At Bristol, the whole city seemed\r\nalarmed; Quakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, and sectarians of all kinds,\r\nran after him; and churches were as full on week days as they had used\r\nto be on Sundays. Wesley wrote to his Oxford friends, asking help for\r\nGeorgia. Whitefield was preaching as often as four times a day, and\r\nhad become so famous that Raikes, of Gloucester, and others, thought\r\nit an enrichment of their newspapers to insert accounts of his doings;\r\nbut his friend Wesley needed help, and that was quite enough to make\r\nhim treat as trifles the praises of the multitudes who ran after him.\r\nJust at the time when Wesley was compelled to leave Georgia, Whitefield\r\nrepaired to London to embark for it. During his brief detention, in\r\nless than three months, he preached in London above a hundred sermons,\r\nand collected above a thousand pounds for charity schools and for the\r\npoor. When he set sail, he read prayers and preached twice every day;\r\nand such was his influence on board, that the very soldiers stood out\r\nbefore him to say their catechism like little children.\r\n\r\nThe day after his arrival at Savannah, Causton and the magistrates sent\r\nword that they would wait upon him; but he chose rather to wait upon\r\nthem, and was treated with as much deference as Wesley had been treated\r\nwith disrespect. He began to visit from house to house, catechized,\r\nread prayers morning and evening, and expounded the two second lessons\r\nevery day. He found Tomo-Chichi, the Indian chief, on a blanket, thin\r\nand meagre, and evidently dying. At Hampstead and Highgate he followed\r\nWesley’s example, and read prayers once a week, though the population\r\nof the former village consisted of only three men, one woman, and seven\r\nchildren. He also visited Thunderbolt, a village of three families\r\nconsisting of sixteen persons, and preached to them. He likewise opened\r\na girls’ school at Savannah. He paid a few days’ visit to Frederica,\r\nwhere there was now a population of about one hundred and twenty; and\r\nread prayers and preached, under a large tree, to more than could have\r\nbeen expected. He also visited the Saltzburghers at Ebenezer, and found\r\ntwo such pious ministers as he had not often seen.\r\n\r\nFour months having been thus spent, he set out for England, the\r\nSavannah people bidding adieu to him with tearful eyes, and begging\r\nthat he would soon return. He landed in Ireland in November, where\r\nmayors and bishops vied with each other in inviting him to their\r\nmansions and palaces, and where he also took the opportunity of\r\nvisiting the cabins of Irish peasants, in one of which, twenty feet\r\nlong and twelve broad, there were a man, his wife and three children,\r\ntwo pigs feeding, two dogs, and several geese, a great fire, and the\r\nmaster of the family threshing corn.\r\n\r\nOn reaching London, he found that those who had been awakened by\r\nhis preaching a year ago had “grown strong men in Christ, by the\r\nministrations of his dear friends and fellow labourers, John and\r\nCharles Wesley.” The old doctrine of justification by faith only\r\nhad been much revived; societies had been instituted at Fetter Lane\r\nand other places; and Whitefield ended the eventful year of 1738 by\r\npreaching and expounding, during the last week of it, not fewer than\r\nseven-and-twenty times.[228]\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to Wesley. He landed at Deal early in the morning of\r\nFebruary 1; and at once resumed his work in England, by reading prayers\r\nand preaching at the inn. After breakfast, he set out for London, and,\r\nreaching Faversham at night, he again read prayers and expounded the\r\nsecond lesson to a few who were called Christians, but who were more\r\nsavage in their behaviour than the wildest Indians he had ever met. His\r\nnext halting place was Blendon, where the family of his friend Charles\r\nDelamotte gave him a hearty welcome. On the evening of February 3, he\r\narrived in London; and, without delay, visited Oglethorpe, and waited\r\nupon the Georgian trustees; gave to them a written account why he had\r\nleft the colony; and returned to them the instrument whereby they had\r\nappointed him minister of Savannah.\r\n\r\nWesley was too earnest to take a holiday. Time with him was too\r\nimportant for any part of it to be spent in idleness. Reaching\r\nLondon on Friday, he resumed preaching on Sunday; and, for the next\r\nfifty-three years, never ceased, and never lagged, in this important\r\nwork, except when serious sickness occasionally laid upon him a brief\r\nembargo.\r\n\r\nAnd, certainly, if England ever needed earnest, enthusiastic labourers,\r\nit was now. During this very year of 1738, not fewer than fifty-two\r\ncriminals were hanged at Tyburn; and within the last two years about\r\n12,000 persons had been convicted, within the Bills of Mortality, of\r\nsmuggling gin, or of selling it without the £50 per annum licence.\r\nSunday traffic had become such a nuisance in London and its suburbs,\r\nthat even the court of aldermen interfered, and commanded the marshals,\r\nand all constables, beadles, and other public officers, to use their\r\nbest endeavours to suppress it. They were also to apprehend all\r\nshoeblacks cleaning shoes in the public streets; and to take notice\r\nof all vintners, ale and coffee house keepers, barbers, and others,\r\nwho exercised their ordinary trades on Sundays. A committee of the\r\nHouse of Lords “to examine into the causes of the present notorious\r\nimmorality and profaneness,” stated, in their report, that they had\r\nsufficient grounds to believe that a number of loose and disorderly\r\npersons had of late formed themselves into a club, under the name of\r\n_Blasters_, and were using means to induce the youth of the kingdom to\r\njoin them. The members of this impious club professed themselves to be\r\nvotaries of the devil, offered prayers to him, and drank his health.\r\nThey also had been heard to utter “the most daring and execrable\r\nblasphemies against the sacred name and majesty of God; and to use\r\nsuch obscene, blasphemous, and before unheard of expressions as the\r\nLords’ committee think they cannot even mention, and therefore they\r\npass them over in silence.” The same committee further reported, that\r\n“of late years there had appeared a greater neglect of religion and\r\nof all things sacred—a greater neglect of Divine worship, both public\r\nand private, and of the due observance of the sabbath, than had ever\r\nbefore been known in England. There was a want of reverence to the laws\r\nand to magistrates, and of a due subordination in the several ranks\r\nand degrees of the community. There was an abuse of liberty, a great\r\nneglect in education, and a want of care in training children, and in\r\nkeeping servants in good order; while idleness, luxury, gambling, and\r\nan excessive use of spirituous and intoxicating liquors had grown into\r\nan alarming magnitude.” The report concludes by recommending that the\r\nbishops be desired, at their visitations, to particularly charge the\r\nclergy to exhort the people to a more frequent and constant attendance\r\nat Divine services; and that visitors of the universities and of\r\nschools require the fellows and masters carefully to instruct the youth\r\ncommitted to their care, in the principles of religion and morality; to\r\nwhich recommendation the House of Lords agreed.\r\n\r\nOne month, in 1738, was spent by Wesley in his homeward voyage from\r\nAmerica. Three others were spent in Germany. During the remaining eight\r\nhe preached in various parts of England, at least, eighty times. One\r\nof his sermons was delivered in the cabin of a ship, two were preached\r\nin workhouses, eleven in Oxford castle, one in Oxford Bocardo, one\r\nin Lincoln College chapel, one in Manchester, one at Windsor, one at\r\nStanton-Harcourt, two in Newgate prison, and the remainder principally\r\nin twenty-six different churches in the metropolis. His sermon at St.\r\nJohn the Evangelist’s “offended many of the best in the parish.” His\r\nfirst discourse at St. Lawrence’s was “an open defiance of that mystery\r\nof iniquity which the world calls ‘prudence,’” and gave great offence.\r\nA sermon at Oxford castle was chiefly addressed to a man condemned\r\nto die, and who, on the same day, found the forgiveness of his sins,\r\nand shortly after went to the gallows “enjoying perfect peace.” At one\r\nof his sermons in Newgate prison, nine persons were present who had\r\nrecently received sentence of death—two for murdering their wives, one\r\nfor filing guineas, two for burglary, and four for robberies. These\r\nwretched creatures, and two others previously condemned, were all\r\nexecuted at Tyburn, on November 8;[229] and, at their earnest desire,\r\nWesley and his brother, on the day of execution, went to Newgate “to do\r\nthe last good office” to them. Charles preached; the malefactors wept;\r\nand some of them, at least, were filled with “the peace of God which\r\npasseth all understanding.” Wesley writes: “It was the most glorious\r\ninstance I ever saw of faith triumphing over sin and death.”\r\n\r\nThe great event in Wesley’s history, during the year 1738, was his\r\nconversion. Something has been said already on this momentous subject;\r\nbut other facts and explanations must now be given. Let us try to\r\nanswer the questions following:—\r\n\r\n1. What was the religious state, and what were the religious views, of\r\nWesley previous to his conversion? 2. What were the doctrines he was\r\ntaught by Peter Bohler? 3. When was he converted? and how?\r\n\r\n1. Wesley’s religious state and views previous to his conversion.\r\n\r\nHe was _almost a Christian_.[230] He most rigorously abstained from\r\neverything which the gospel of Christ prohibits, and cheerfully\r\npractised everything which it enjoins. He avoided every form of\r\nprofanity, and every word or look that, directly or indirectly, tended\r\nto uncleanness. He equally avoided detraction, backbiting, talebearing,\r\nevil speaking, and idle words. He was no railer, brawler, or scoffer\r\nat the faults or infirmities of others, but continually endeavoured to\r\nlive peaceably with all men. He laboured and suffered for the benefit\r\nof many. He reproved the wicked, instructed the ignorant, confirmed\r\nthe wavering, quickened the good, and comforted the afflicted. He used\r\nall the means of grace, and at all opportunities: he attended public\r\nservice every day; he communicated every week; he constantly used\r\nfamily prayer; he had set times daily for private devotions. All this\r\nwas done from a sincere and hearty desire to serve God and to do His\r\nwill. In all his conversation and in all his actions—in all he did\r\nand in all he left undone, his only motive was a design to please and\r\nhonour God. He declares that he went thus far for many years, and yet\r\nthat all this time he was only _almost a Christian_.[231]\r\n\r\nHe held no principles but what he believed to be revealed in the word\r\nof God; and, in the interpretation of that word he always judged the\r\nmost literal sense to be the best, unless when the literal sense of\r\none scripture contradicted some other. He firmly believed in a change\r\nwrought in the heart by the Holy Spirit, and called a person thus\r\nchanged “regenerated, born again, and a new creature.” In all other\r\ncases, he endeavoured to express spiritual things in spiritual words,\r\nthough he was not ignorant that such words and their hidden meaning\r\nwere treated by the unconverted as jargon and cant.[232]\r\n\r\nHe had many remarkable answers to prayer, especially when he was in\r\ntrouble; and he had many sensible comforts—short anticipations of the\r\nlife of faith. He had a Divine conviction of God and of the things\r\nof God; and firmly believed in Jesus Christ as the Saviour of the\r\nworld.[233] He was, at least, a _servant_ of God, _and was accepted\r\nof Him_;[234] and yet all this while he was beating the air, and was\r\nseeking to establish his own righteousness, instead of submitting to\r\nthe righteousness of Christ which is by faith. He delighted in the law\r\nof God, after the inner man; and yet he was carnal, sold under sin.\r\nEvery day he was constrained to cry out, “What I do I allow not: for\r\nwhat I would I do not; but what I hate that I do. To will is present\r\nwith me; but how to perform that which is good, I find not.” He was\r\nfighting with sin continually, but not always conquering. Before,\r\nhe had _willingly_ served sin; now it was _unwillingly_; but still\r\nhe served it. He fell, and rose, and fell again. Sometimes he was\r\novercome, and in heaviness; sometimes he overcame, and was in joy.\r\nOnce he had foretastes of the terrors of the law; but now he had\r\nforetastes of the comforts of the gospel. For above ten years there was\r\nin him this struggle between nature and grace; and yet he was still\r\nonly striving with, not freed from, sin; neither had he the witness of\r\nthe Spirit with his spirit that he was a child of God; nor indeed could\r\nhe, for he “sought it not by faith, but, as it were, by the works of\r\nthe law.”[235]\r\n\r\nSuch is Wesley’s description of himself; and this, when added to what\r\nhas been previously said concerning his religious career at Oxford,\r\nwill be a sufficient answer to the first of the three questions\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\n2. The second is, what were the doctrines which Wesley was taught by\r\nPeter Bohler?\r\n\r\nIn the storm which Wesley encountered in his voyage from Georgia, he\r\nfound himself in fear of death; and was convinced that the cause of it\r\nwas unbelief; and that the gaining a true living faith was the “one\r\nthing needful” for him.\r\n\r\nPeter Bohler told him that true faith in Christ was inseparably\r\nattended by—(1) dominion over sin; and (2) constant peace, arising from\r\na sense of forgiveness. Wesley was amazed, and regarded this as a new\r\ngospel; for if this was so, it was clear that he was without true faith\r\nin Christ, because he was without its inseparable fruits. He was not\r\nwilling to be convinced of this. He disputed with all his strength,\r\nand laboured to prove that there might be faith without the two fruits\r\nmentioned, and especially the second. Bohler referred him to the Bible\r\nand to experience. Wesley consulted the Bible, and when he had set\r\naside the glosses of men he was bound to acknowledge that Bohler was\r\ncorrect. Still he hesitated to believe that any “experience” could be\r\nadduced in favour of Bohler’s doctrine. The next day Bohler brought\r\nto him three persons, all of whom testified of their own personal\r\nexperience that a true living faith in Christ is inseparable from a\r\nsense of pardon for all past, and freedom from all present, sins. They\r\nalso added, with one mouth, that this faith is the gift, the free gift\r\nof God; and that He will surely give it to every one who earnestly and\r\nperseveringly prays for it.\r\n\r\nAt subsequent interviews with Bohler, another doctrine was forced\r\non Wesley, namely, that this saving faith in Christ is given in a\r\nmoment; and that in an instant a man is turned from sin and misery\r\nto righteousness and joy in the Holy Ghost. Wesley kicked against\r\nthis also; and Bohler again referred him to the Scriptures and\r\nto experience. Wesley searched the Scriptures; and, to his utter\r\nastonishment, he found there were scarcely any instances of other\r\nthan _instantaneous_ conversions. Still he had one retreat left,\r\nand told Bohler that, though “God wrought thus in the first ages of\r\nChristianity, times now were changed.” To meet this objection, Bohler,\r\nthe day after, turned to his _experience_ test, and brought to Wesley\r\nseveral living witnesses, who testified that God had given them, in\r\na moment, such a faith in Christ as translated them out of darkness\r\ninto light, out of sin and fear into holiness and happiness. Wesley\r\nwrites: “Here ended my disputing. I could now only cry out, ‘Lord, help\r\nThou my unbelief.’ I was now thoroughly convinced; and, by the grace\r\nof God, I resolved to seek this faith unto the end—(1) By absolutely\r\nrenouncing all dependence, in whole or in part, upon my own works of\r\nrighteousness; on which I had really grounded my hope of salvation,\r\nthough I knew it not, from my youth up. (2) By adding to the constant\r\nuse of all the other means of grace continual prayer for this very\r\nthing—justifying, saving faith, a full reliance on the blood of Christ\r\nshed for me; a trust in Him as my Christ, as my sole justification,\r\nsanctification, and redemption.”[236]\r\n\r\nThese then were the great doctrines which Peter Bohler brought to the\r\nhearing of John Wesley. They were new to him; but finding them to be\r\nscriptural, and also corroborated by living experience, he at once\r\nbelieved them. He went to the Delamotte family at Blendon, and there\r\nspake clearly and fully concerning them. Mr. Broughton and his brother\r\nCharles were present. The former objected, and the latter became so\r\nmuch offended, that in anger he left the room, telling his brother that\r\nhis newfangled doctrines were mischievous.[237] Wesley also wrote to\r\nhis brother Samuel on the same subject, on the 4th of April, declaring\r\nthat he had seen, so far as it could be seen, very many persons\r\nchanged, in a moment, from the spirit of horror, fear, and despair, to\r\nthe spirit of hope, joy, and peace; and from sinful desires, till then\r\nreigning over them, to a pure desire of doing the will of God.[238]\r\n\r\nWe proceed to the third question,—\r\n\r\n3. When and how was Wesley converted? His first interview with Bohler\r\nwas on February 7, 1738; and, from that time till the 4th of May,\r\nwhen Bohler left London for Carolina, he embraced every opportunity\r\nof conversing with him. They went in company to Oxford, and to Mr.\r\nGambold, at Stanton-Harcourt. The man of erudition, and of almost\r\nanchorite piety, sat at the feet of this godly German like a little\r\nchild, and was content to be thought a fool that he might be wise.\r\n“My brother, my brother,” said Bohler, “that philosophy of yours must\r\nbe purged away;” and purged away it was. Wesley thought that, being\r\nwithout faith, he ought to leave off preaching. But Bohler replied:\r\n“By no means. Preach faith till you have it; and then, because you\r\nhave it, you will preach it;” and, on the 6th of March, he began to\r\npreach accordingly. Meanwhile several of his friends, as his brother\r\nCharles, Mr. Gambold, and Mr. Stonehouse, vicar of Islington, had\r\nembraced the doctrine of salvation by faith only; and two, Whitefield,\r\nand Mr. Hutchins, of Pembroke College, had experienced it.[239] Charles\r\nWesley also, on Whit-Sunday, May 21, was made a partaker of the same\r\ngreat blessing. At the time, he was ill of pleurisy, and his brother\r\nand some other friends came to him, and sang a hymn of praise to the\r\nHoly Ghost; and, after they were gone, he was enabled to exercise that\r\nfaith in Christ of the want of which he had been recently convinced,\r\nand was filled with love and peace. Wesley himself was still a mourner.\r\nHis heart was heavy. He felt that there was no good in him; and that\r\nall his works, his righteousness, and his prayers, so far from having\r\nmerit, needed an atonement for themselves. His mouth was stopped. He\r\nknew that he deserved nothing but wrath; and yet he heard a voice,\r\nsaying, “Believe, and thou shalt be saved;” “he that believeth is\r\npassed from death unto life.” Three more days of anguish were thus\r\npassed; and then, on May 24, at five in the morning, he opened his\r\nTestament on these words: “There are given unto us exceeding great\r\nand precious promises, that by these ye might be partakers of the\r\nDivine nature.” On leaving home, he opened on the text, “Thou art\r\nnot far from the kingdom of God.” In the afternoon, he went to St.\r\nPaul’s Cathedral, where the anthem was full of comfort. At night, he\r\nwent to a society-meeting in Aldersgate Street, where a person read\r\nLuther’s preface to the epistle to the Romans, in which Luther teaches\r\nwhat faith is, and also that faith alone justifies. Possessed of it,\r\nthe heart is “cheered, elevated, excited, and transported with sweet\r\naffections towards God.” Receiving the Holy Ghost, through faith, the\r\nman “is renewed and made spiritual,” and he is impelled to fulfil the\r\nlaw “by the vital energy in himself.” While this preface was being\r\nread, Wesley experienced an amazing change. He writes: “I felt my\r\nheart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone,\r\nfor salvation; and an assurance was given me, that He had taken away\r\nmy sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death; and I\r\nthen testified openly to all there, what I now first felt in my heart.”\r\nTowards ten o’clock, a troop of friends took him to his brother; they\r\nsang a hymn with joy; and then parted with a prayer.[240]\r\n\r\nTo add to this would be folly. The questions proposed have been\r\nanswered from Wesley’s own writings. For ten years he had believed\r\nin Christ, but never believed as he did now. He had been intensely\r\npious; but now he possessed power over himself and sin which he had not\r\npossessed before. He had practised religion; but now he experienced\r\nits bliss. According to his own sermon, written nearly half a century\r\nsubsequent to this, he was, as a _servant_ of God, _accepted_, and was\r\n_safe_; but now he _knew_ it, and was _happy_ as well as _safe_. There\r\nwas sunshine in his soul, which lit up his face, and which turned the\r\nsevere ascetic, for a season at least, into a joyful saint.\r\n\r\nHaving given, as briefly and as clearly as we can, an account of the\r\nway in which Wesley, after ten years of earnest prayer, rigorous\r\nfasting, and self-sacrificing piety, was brought into the blissful\r\nenjoyment of a conscious salvation, this may be a fitting place to\r\nnotice the man, by whose instrumentality he was taught the nature and\r\nfruits of saving faith.\r\n\r\nPeter Bohler was born at Frankfort, on the last day of the year 1712.\r\nHe was educated in the university of Jena, where he also studied\r\ntheology. When sixteen years of age, he joined the Moravians; and\r\nwhen twenty-five, he was ordained for the work of the ministry by\r\nCount Zinzendorf, this being the first time that the count exercised\r\nhis episcopal functions. Immediately after his ordination, Bohler set\r\nout for London, on his way to Carolina; and here it was that Wesley\r\nfirst met him. Wesley introduced him to James Hutton, and procured him\r\nlodgings. Charles Wesley began to teach him English; and a tailor, of\r\nthe name of Viney, interpreted his Latin addresses in the Moravian\r\nmeetings. Questions were asked him, and he simply answered them from\r\nthe Holy Scriptures. His exposition of saving faith was new, even to\r\nthe London Moravians; and, “to their astonishment, they saw, for the\r\nfirst time, that he who believeth in Jesus hath everlasting life;\r\nand it was with indescribable joy that they embraced the doctrine of\r\njustification through faith in Christ, and of freedom by it from the\r\ndominion and guilt of sin.”[241] Marvellous blessings attended Bohler’s\r\ninterpreted discourses; and a work was begun, says Wesley, “such as\r\nwill never come to an end, till heaven and earth pass away.”\r\n\r\n“I travelled,” writes Bohler to Zinzendorf, “with the two brothers,\r\nJohn and Charles Wesley, from London to Oxford. The elder, John,\r\nis a good-natured man: he knew he did not properly believe on the\r\nSaviour, and was willing to be taught. His brother, with whom you\r\noften conversed a year ago, is at present very much distressed in his\r\nmind, but does not know how he shall begin to be acquainted with the\r\nSaviour. Our mode of believing in the Saviour is so easy to Englishmen,\r\nthat they cannot reconcile themselves to it; if it were a little more\r\nartful, they would much sooner find their way into it. Of faith in\r\nJesus they have no other idea than the generality of people have. They\r\njustify themselves; and, therefore, they always take it for granted,\r\nthat they believe already, and try to prove their faith by their works,\r\nand thus so plague and torment themselves that they are at heart very\r\nmiserable.”[242]\r\n\r\nThese are weighty words on the simplicity of saving faith, and well\r\ndeserve pondering by both the ministers and members of the church at\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nWesley had found peace with God; but, for the encouragement of new\r\nconverts, let it be remembered that his joy in the Holy Ghost was not\r\nunbroken. The same night, he “was much buffeted with temptations, which\r\nreturned again and again.” The day after, “the enemy injected a fear”\r\nthat the change was not great enough, and therefore that his faith was\r\nnot real. On May 26, his “soul continued in peace, but yet in heaviness\r\nbecause of manifold temptations.” On the 27th, there was a want of joy,\r\nwhich led him to resolve to spend the time of every morning, until\r\nhe went to church, in unceasing prayer. On the 31st, he “grieved the\r\nSpirit of God, not only by not watching unto prayer, but likewise by\r\nspeaking with sharpness, instead of tender love, of one who was not\r\nsound in the faith. Immediately God hid His face, and he was troubled\r\nand in heaviness till the next morning.” But, in the midst of all, he\r\nkept waiting upon God continually, read the New Testament, conquered\r\ntemptations, and gained increasing power to trust and to rejoice in God\r\nhis Saviour. He had to fight; but he was not, as formerly, subdued.\r\n\r\nHe went to Oxford; but the whole of his old Methodist friends were now\r\ndispersed. Here he preached his celebrated sermon in St. Mary’s, before\r\nthe university, on the text, “By grace are ye saved, through faith;”\r\na sermon which, in November following, was published by James Hutton,\r\npp. 25, price threepence. In this discourse, he showed that the faith\r\nthrough which we are saved is not barely the faith of a heathen, who\r\nbelieves that God is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently\r\nseek Him; nor, secondly, is it the faith of a devil, who, in addition\r\nto the faith of a heathen, believes that Jesus is the Son of God, the\r\nChrist, the Saviour of the world; nor, thirdly, is it barely the faith\r\nwhich the apostles had while Christ was yet upon earth, although they\r\nso believed in Christ as to leave all and follow Him, had power to\r\nwork miracles, and were sent to preach; but, fourthly, “it is a full\r\nreliance on the blood of Christ,—a trust in the merits of His life,\r\ndeath, and resurrection,—a recumbency upon Him as our atonement and our\r\nlife, as given for us and living in us; and, in consequence hereof, a\r\nclosing with Him and cleaving to Him, as our wisdom, righteousness,\r\nsanctification, and redemption, or, in one word, our salvation.”\r\n\r\nThe salvation obtained by such a faith is described as being a\r\nsalvation—(1) From the guilt of all past sin; (2) From servile fear;\r\n(3) From the power of sin. The man having it is pardoned; he has the\r\nwitness of the Spirit that he is a child of God; he is born again; and\r\nhe lives without sin.\r\n\r\nWesley further answers objections to this doctrine, and shows that to\r\npreach salvation by faith only is not to preach against holiness and\r\ngood works; neither does it lead men into pride, nor drive them to\r\ndespair. He maintains that never was the preaching of this doctrine\r\nmore seasonable than now, and that nothing else can effectually prevent\r\nthe increase of the popish delusion. It was this which drove Popery out\r\nof the kingdom, and it is this alone that can keep it out.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable sermon was preached eighteen days after Wesley’s\r\nconversion—not on June 18, as is stated in Wesley’s collected works,\r\nbut on June 11. Well would it be if, at the present day, the same great\r\ndoctrine were as plainly preached as Wesley preached it. For want of\r\nit, the church is gliding into a sort of religious scepticism; and\r\nthis, above all things else, would prove a check to the spread of the\r\npopish errors and practices, which are too successfully setting at\r\ndefiance all the wisdom and power of man to prevent their triumph.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Wesley published another sermon, “On God’s Free\r\nGrace,”[243] in which he gave equal prominence to another great Bible\r\ntruth, namely, that “the grace or love of God, whence cometh our\r\nsalvation, is _free in all_, and _free for all_.” And then, in defence\r\nof himself as a good Churchman, he issued a small 12mo pamphlet of\r\nsixteen pages, entitled “The Doctrine of Salvation, Faith, and Good\r\nWorks: extracted from the Homilies of the Church of England.” Here he\r\nshows that the doctrine of that Church is, that the sinner is justified\r\nby faith only; and yet this faith does not exclude repentance,\r\nhope, love, and fear of God; but shuts them out from the office of\r\njustifying. “So that, although they be all present together in him\r\nthat is justified, yet they justify not altogether.” “Neither does\r\nfaith shut out good works, necessary to be done afterwards; but we are\r\nnot to do them with the intent of being justified by doing them.” He\r\nfurther shows that “justification is the office of God only,—a blessing\r\nwhich we receive of Him by His free mercy, through the only merits of\r\nHis beloved Son.” He adds: “the right and true Christian faith is not\r\nonly to believe that holy Scripture and the articles of our faith are\r\ntrue, but also to have a sure trust and confidence to be saved from\r\neverlasting damnation by Christ; whereof doth follow a loving heart\r\nto obey His commandments.” He maintains further that, without this\r\ntrue saving faith, the works we do cannot be good and acceptable in\r\nthe sight of God. “Faith giveth life to the soul, and they are as much\r\ndead to God who want faith, as they are to the world whose bodies want\r\nsouls. Without faith all we do is but dead before God, be it ever so\r\nglorious before man.”\r\n\r\nSuch then were the great doctrines which Wesley grasped, and began to\r\npreach in 1738. It was the preaching of these doctrines that gave birth\r\nto the greatest revival of religion chronicled in the history of the\r\nchurch of Christ. From such doctrines Wesley never wavered; and God\r\nforbid that they should ever be abandoned, or even partially neglected,\r\nby any of Wesley’s successors. They are not Moravian whims, or the\r\nfancies of fanatics. They are a great deal more than even Bible truths\r\nof subordinate importance. They are essentially and vitally connected\r\nwith man’s salvation both here and hereafter, and no church has ever\r\nprospered except in proportion as its ministers have prominently and\r\nfaithfully taught and enforced them in their congregations.\r\n\r\nIt may reasonably be asked how was it that Wesley—the son of a most\r\nable divine of the Church of England, and himself a man of extensive\r\nlearning, and a devoted student of Christian truth—how was it, that\r\nhe lived so long without a knowledge of one of the greatest, and yet\r\nmost clearly taught doctrines of the holy Bible, the doctrine of the\r\nsinner’s salvation by faith alone? Wesley himself tells us: from early\r\nlife he had been warned against the papistical error of laying too\r\nmuch stress on outward works. After this, he read certain Lutheran\r\nand Calvinist authors, whose confused and indigested expositions\r\nmagnified faith to such an amazing size that it quite hid all the\r\nrest of the commandments. In this labyrinth he was bewildered. He\r\nwished, on the one hand, to avoid the popish doctrine of salvation by\r\nworks; but, in doing this, he was beset, on the other hand, with an\r\nuncouth hypothesis concerning salvation by faith, which he found it\r\nimpossible to reconcile either with Scripture or common sense. From\r\nthese well meaning but wrong headed writers, he turned to authors\r\nlike Beveridge, Nelson, and Jeremy Taylor, by whom his difficulties\r\nwere, to some extent, relieved; but even these he found interpreting\r\nScripture in different ways, and he was nearly as much confused as\r\never. After this, he was taught that he ought to interpret the Bible\r\nby the general teachings of the ancient church. Adopting this rule,\r\nhe, for a season, made antiquity a co-ordinate rather than subordinate\r\nrule with Scripture, and, by extending his antiquity principle too far,\r\nhis confusion of mind became greater instead of less. He then became\r\nacquainted with the Mystics, whose “noble descriptions of union with\r\nGod, and internal religion, made everything else appear mean and flat;”\r\nyet here again, on reflection, he found that he was wrong. Mysticism\r\nwas nothing like the religion which Christ and His apostles lived and\r\ntaught.[244] Thus was this sincere and earnest inquirer after truth led\r\nto and fro in a wilderness of perplexing entanglements, until Peter\r\nBohler took him by the hand, and led him as a contrite sinner to the\r\ncross of Christ.\r\n\r\nTen days before his conversion, Wesley wrote a somewhat petulant letter\r\nto William Law, telling him that he did so in obedience to what he\r\nconsidered the call of God. He informs him that, for two years, he had\r\nbeen preaching after the model of his “Serious Call,” and “Christian\r\nPerfection,” and that the result had been to convince the people that\r\nthe law of God was holy, but that, when they attempted to fulfil it,\r\nthey found themselves without power. Wesley declares that he himself\r\nwas in this state, and might have groaned in it till he died if he had\r\nnot been directed to Peter Bohler. He then proceeds:—\r\n\r\n    “Now, sir, suffer me to ask, how will you answer it to our\r\n    common Lord, that you never gave me this advice? Did you never\r\n    read the Acts of the Apostles, or the answer of Paul to him\r\n    who said, ‘What must I do to be saved?’ Or are you wiser than\r\n    he? Why did I scarce ever hear you name the name of Christ?\r\n    Never so as to ground anything upon faith in His blood? Who is\r\n    this who is laying another foundation? If you say you advised\r\n    other things as preparatory to this, what is this but laying a\r\n    foundation below the foundation? If you say you advised them\r\n    because you knew that I had faith already, verily you knew\r\n    nothing of me. I know that I had not faith, unless the faith of\r\n    a devil, the faith of Judas: that speculative, notional, airy\r\n    shadow, which lives in the head not in the heart. But what is\r\n    this to the living, justifying faith in the blood of Jesus?\r\n    the faith that cleanseth from sin, that gives us to have free\r\n    access to the Father; to rejoice in hope of the glory of God;\r\n    to have the love of God shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy\r\n    Ghost, which dwelleth in us, and the Spirit itself bearing\r\n    witness with our spirits that we are the children of God?\r\n\r\n    “I beseech you, sir, by the mercies of God, to consider deeply\r\n    and impartially whether the true reason of your never pressing\r\n    this upon me was not this—that you had it not yourself? Whether\r\n    that man of God [Bohler] was not in the right, who gave this\r\n    account of a late interview he had with you? ‘I began speaking\r\n    to him of faith in Christ: he was silent. Then he began to\r\n    speak of mystical matters. I spake to him of faith in Christ\r\n    again: he was silent. Then he began to speak of mystical\r\n    matters again. I saw his state at once.’”\r\n\r\nWesley then adds that Bohler thought the state of Law to be a dangerous\r\none; and intimates that Bohler’s opinion was of great consequence,\r\nbecause he had the Spirit of God; and finally, he concludes his not too\r\ncourteous epistle with: “Once more, sir, let me beg you to consider\r\nwhether your extreme roughness, and morose and sour behaviour, at least\r\non many occasions, can possibly be the fruit of a living faith in\r\nChrist?”[245]\r\n\r\nThis was an uncalled for, rough, morose attack upon a man of the\r\ngreatest ability, of distinguished though mistaken piety, whose works\r\nWesley had read with the highest admiration, whose advice Wesley\r\nhad sought, and who was nearly old enough to be Wesley’s father. Law\r\nreplied to it in a letter dated May 19, 1738. After some withering\r\nsarcasm, in reference to Wesley having written his letter in obedience\r\nto the call of God, Law proceeds to say:—\r\n\r\n    “You have had a great many conversations with me, and you never\r\n    were with me for half an hour without my being large upon that\r\n    very doctrine, which you make me totally silent and ignorant\r\n    of. The second time I saw you I put into your hands the little\r\n    book of the German theology, and said all that I could in\r\n    recommendation of the doctrine contained in it. If that book\r\n    does not plainly lead you to Jesus Christ, I am content to know\r\n    as little of Christianity as you are pleased to believe; or\r\n    if you are for stripping yourself naked of your own works, or\r\n    righteousness, further than that book directs, I had rather you\r\n    were taught that doctrine by any one else than by me. Above a\r\n    year ago, I published a book against the ‘Plain Account of the\r\n    Sacrament,’ etc. You may perhaps be too much prejudiced against\r\n    me to read it; but, as you have made yourself a judge of the\r\n    state of my heart, and of my knowledge in Christ, you ought to\r\n    have seen that book to help you to make a right judgment of my\r\n    sentiments. What I have there written I judge to be well timed\r\n    after my former discourses. I have been governed through all\r\n    that I have written and done by these two common, fundamental,\r\n    unchangeable maxims of our Lord: ‘_Without Me ye can do\r\n    nothing:_’ ‘_If any man will come after Me or be My disciple,\r\n    let him take up his cross and follow Me._’ If you are for\r\n    separating the doctrine of the cross from faith in Christ, or\r\n    following Him, you have numbers and names enough on your side,\r\n    but not me.”\r\n\r\nLaw continues: “Let me advise you not to be too hasty in believing that\r\nbecause you have changed your language you have changed your faith. The\r\nhead can as easily amuse itself with a living and justifying faith in\r\nthe blood of Jesus as with any other notion; and the heart which you\r\nsuppose to be a place of security, as being the seat of self-love, is\r\nmore deceitful than the head.”\r\n\r\nA lengthened correspondence followed, which Mr. Law concluded\r\nthus:—“Who made me your teacher? or can make me answerable for any\r\ndefects in your knowledge? You sought my acquaintance; you came to me\r\nas you pleased, and on what occasion you pleased, and to say to me what\r\nyou pleased. If it was my business to put this question to you, and if\r\nyou have a right to charge me with guilt for the neglect of it, may you\r\nnot much more reasonably accuse them who have authoritatively charge\r\nover you? Did the Church in which you are educated put this question\r\nto you? Did the bishop who ordained you either deacon or priest do this\r\nfor you? Did the bishop who sent you a missionary to Georgia require\r\nthis of you? Pray, sir, be at peace with me.”[246]\r\n\r\nThis was a miserable squabble, into which Wesley foolishly rushed,\r\nand out of which he came not victorious, but vanquished. It was an\r\nunfortunate commencement of a new Christian life, and led to an\r\nestrangement between two great and good men, which ought never to have\r\nexisted. No doubt, the theology of William Law was defective; but to\r\ncharge him with the guilt of Wesley’s want of faith, and to accuse\r\nhim of extremely rough, morose, and sour behaviour, was a deplorable\r\noutrage against good manners.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the only unpleasantness which now sprang up. The\r\nMoravian movement and the new conversions began to attract great\r\nattention and to create some alarm. As might naturally be expected,\r\namid so much excitement, there was a mixture of extravagance. The\r\nsister of Mr. Bray dreamed that at night she heard a knock at her door,\r\nand on opening it saw a person dressed in white. She asked him who he\r\nwas, and he answered, “I am Jesus Christ.” She awoke in a fright, but a\r\nday or two after was filled with faith, and was commanded by an unseen\r\npower to go to Charles Wesley, who was ill, and assure him from Christ\r\nof his recovery of soul and body. In a prayer-meeting a Mr. Verding\r\ndeclared that he had just seen, as it were, a whole army rushing by him\r\nand bearing the broken body of Christ; a sight which was overpowering,\r\nand cast him into a cold sweat. A young man, as he entered St.\r\nDunstan’s church to receive the sacrament, was met by Christ carrying\r\nHis cross in His hands: and a woman dreamed that a ball of fire fell\r\nupon her, and fired her soul. Samuel Wesley, of Tiverton, to whom these\r\nthings were related, justly deemed them “downright madness;” and, in\r\nhis anger, went so far as to wish that those “canting fellows,” as he\r\ncalled the Moravians, “who talked of _indwellings_, _experiences_,\r\n_getting into Christ_,” etc., had been somewhere else.[247]\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of anxiety, however, arose from Mrs. Hutton’s\r\ndescription of her two lodgers. She relates that, when the two Wesleys\r\nreturned from Georgia, she received and treated them with the utmost\r\nlove and tenderness; but John was now “turned a wild enthusiast.” While\r\nher husband was reading to a number of people in his study a sermon of\r\nBishop Blackall’s, John Wesley stood up and told the company that, five\r\ndays ago, he was not a Christian. Mr. Hutton was thunderstruck, and\r\nsaid, “Have a care, Mr. Wesley, how you despise the benefits received\r\nby the two sacraments;” but Wesley repeated his declaration, upon which\r\nMrs. Hutton answered, “If you have not been a Christian ever since I\r\nknew you, you have been a great hypocrite, for you made us all believe\r\nthat you were one.” To this Wesley replied that, “When we renounce\r\neverything but faith and get into Christ, then, and not till then, have\r\nwe any reason to believe that we are Christians.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Hutton, in writing an account of all this to Samuel Wesley, adds\r\nthat her two children had so high an opinion of Wesley’s sanctity and\r\njudgment that they were in great danger of being drawn into his “wild\r\nnotions;” that Wesley had “abridged the life of one Halyburton, a\r\nPresbyterian teacher in Scotland,” and that her son had designed to\r\nprint it, but she and her husband had forbidden him to promote such\r\n“rank fanaticism;” and that all his converts were “directed to get an\r\nassurance of their sins being pardoned,” and to expect this in “an\r\ninstant.” She acknowledges that the two Wesleys “are men of great parts\r\nand learning;” but they were now under a “strange delusion;” and she\r\nentreats their brother Samuel to stop this “wildfire,” if he can.\r\n\r\nSamuel Wesley’s reply is dated, “Tiverton, June 17, 1738.” He writes:—\r\n\r\n    “I am sufficiently sensible of yours and Mr. Hutton’s kindness\r\n    to my brothers, and shall always acknowledge it. Falling into\r\n    enthusiasm is being lost with a witness; and, if you are\r\n    troubled for two of your children, you may be sure I am so for\r\n    two whom I may, in some sense, call _mine_. What Jack means by\r\n    his not being a Christian till last month, I understand not.\r\n    Had he never been in covenant with God? Then, as Mr. Hutton\r\n    observed, baptism was nothing. Had he totally apostatized from\r\n    it? I dare say not; and yet he must either be unbaptized, or an\r\n    apostate, to make his words true.\r\n\r\n    “If renouncing everything but faith means rejecting all merit\r\n    of our own good works, what Protestant does not do that? Even\r\n    Bellarmine on his death-bed is said to have renounced all\r\n    merits but those of Christ. But if this renouncing regards\r\n    good works in any other sense, as being unnecessary, it is\r\n    wretchedly wicked.\r\n\r\n    “I hope your son does not think it as plainly revealed that\r\n    he shall print an enthusiastic book, as it is, that he should\r\n    obey his father and his mother. God deliver us from visions\r\n    that shall make the law of God vain! I pleased myself with the\r\n    expectation of seeing Jack; but now I am afraid of it. I know\r\n    not where to direct to him, or where he is. I will write to\r\n    Charles as soon as I can. In the meantime I heartily pray God\r\n    to stop the progress of this lunacy.”[248]\r\n\r\nSamuel asked his brother what he meant by being made a Christian. John\r\nreplied:—\r\n\r\n    “By a Christian, I mean one who so believes in Christ as that\r\n    sin hath no more dominion over him; and, in this obvious sense\r\n    of the word, I was not a Christian till the 24th of May last\r\n    past. Till then sin had dominion over me, although I fought\r\n    with it continually; but, from that time to this, it hath not.\r\n    Such is the free grace of God in Christ. If you ask me, by what\r\n    means I am made free? I answer, by faith in Christ; by such\r\n    a sort or degree of faith as I had not till that day. Some\r\n    measure of this faith, which bringeth salvation or victory over\r\n    sin, and which implies peace and trust in God through Christ,\r\n    I now enjoy by His free mercy; though in very deed it is in me\r\n    but as a grain of mustard seed. For the ‘πληροφορια\r\n    πιστεως,—the seal of the Spirit, the love of God shed abroad\r\n    in my heart, and producing joy in the Holy Ghost, joy which\r\n    no man taketh away, joy unspeakable and full of glory,’—this\r\n    witness of the Spirit I have not; but I wait patiently for it.\r\n    I know many who have already received it; and, having seen and\r\n    spoken with a cloud of witnesses abroad,[249] as well as in my\r\n    own country, I cannot doubt but that believers who wait and\r\n    pray for it will find these scriptures fulfilled in themselves.\r\n    My hope is, that they will be fulfilled in me. I build on\r\n    Christ, the Rock of Ages.”[250]\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe here a strange confession, which has seldom,\r\nif ever, been noticed. The letter, from which the above is taken, was\r\nwritten October 23, 1738, five months after Wesley’s conversion; and\r\nyet he here distinctly states that, as yet, he was not possessed of\r\nthe witness of the Spirit; but was waiting for it. This is contrary\r\nto the commonly received notion, and yet it is in perfect accordance\r\nwith a remarkable entry in his journal, under the date of October\r\n14. He there most carefully examines his religious state by comparing\r\nit with the text, “If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old\r\nthings are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” In many\r\nrespects, he judged himself a new creature; but, in others, he feared\r\nthat he was not. Earthly desires often arose within him, though he was\r\nenabled to put them under his feet through Christ strengthening him.\r\nTo some extent, he possessed longsuffering, gentleness, meekness, and\r\ntemperance; but he had to complain of his want of love, peace, and joy.\r\nHe writes:—\r\n\r\n    “I cannot find in myself the love of God, or of Christ. Hence\r\n    my deadness and wanderings in public prayer: hence it is that,\r\n    even in the holy communion, I have frequently no more than a\r\n    cold attention. Again, I have not that joy in the Holy Ghost;\r\n    no settled, lasting joy. Nor have I such a peace as excludes\r\n    the possibility either of fear or doubt. When holy men have\r\n    told me I had no faith, I have often doubted whether I had\r\n    or no. And these doubts have made me very uneasy, till I was\r\n    relieved by prayer and the holy Scriptures. Yet, upon the\r\n    whole, although I have not yet that joy in the Holy Ghost,\r\n    nor the full assurance of faith,—much less am I, in the full\r\n    sense of the words, ‘in Christ a new creature,’—I nevertheless\r\n    trust that I have a measure of faith, and am ‘accepted in the\r\n    Beloved;’ I trust ‘the handwriting that was against me is\r\n    blotted out,’ and that I am ‘reconciled to God’ through His\r\n    Son.”\r\n\r\nThere is another entry, similar to this, under the date of December 16;\r\nand again, on January 4, 1739, he uses even stronger language:—\r\n\r\n    “My friends affirm I am mad, because I said I was not a\r\n    Christian a year ago. I affirm, I am not a Christian now.\r\n    Indeed, what I might have been I know not, had I been faithful\r\n    to the grace then given, when, expecting nothing less, I\r\n    received such a sense of the forgiveness of my sins as till\r\n    then I never knew. But that I am not a Christian at this day, I\r\n    as assuredly know, as that Jesus is the Christ. For a Christian\r\n    is one who has the fruits of the Spirit of Christ, which (to\r\n    mention no more) are love, peace, joy. But these I have not. I\r\n    have not any love of God. I do not love either the Father or\r\n    the Son. Do you ask, how do I know whether I love God, I answer\r\n    by another question, ‘How do you know whether you love me?’\r\n    Why, as you know whether you are hot or cold. You feel this\r\n    moment that you do or do not love me. And I feel this moment\r\n    I do not love God; which therefore I know, because I feel it.\r\n    And I know it also by St. John’s plain rule, ‘If any man love\r\n    the world, the love of the Father is not in him.’ For I love\r\n    the world. I desire the things of the world, some or other of\r\n    them; and have done all my life. I have always placed some\r\n    part of my happiness in some or other of the things that are\r\n    seen, particularly in meat and drink, and in the company of\r\n    those I loved. For many years, I have been, yea, and still am,\r\n    hankering after a happiness, in loving and being loved by one\r\n    or another. And in these I have, from time to time, taken more\r\n    pleasure than in God.\r\n\r\n    “Again, joy in the Holy Ghost I have not. I have now and then\r\n    some starts of joy in God; but it is not that joy. For it is\r\n    not abiding. Neither is it greater than I have had on some\r\n    worldly occasions. So that I can in nowise be said to ‘rejoice\r\n    evermore;’ much less to ‘rejoice with joy unspeakable and full\r\n    of glory.’\r\n\r\n    “Yet again: I have not ‘the peace of God;’ that peace,\r\n    peculiarly so called. The peace I have may be accounted for\r\n    on natural principles. I have health, strength, friends, a\r\n    competent fortune, and a composed, cheerful temper. Who would\r\n    not have a sort of peace in such circumstances? But I have none\r\n    which can, with any propriety, be called ‘a peace which passeth\r\n    all understanding.’\r\n\r\n    “From hence I conclude, though I have given, and do give, all\r\n    my goods to feed the poor, I am not a Christian. Though I have\r\n    endured hardship, though I have in all things denied myself and\r\n    taken up my cross, I am not a Christian. My works are nothing;\r\n    my sufferings are nothing; I have not the fruits of the Spirit\r\n    of Christ. Though I have constantly used all the means of grace\r\n    for twenty years, I am not a Christian.”\r\n\r\nThis is extremely puzzling; but we are bound to give it as we find\r\nit. It may be said that Wesley merely says, that “one who had had the\r\nform of godliness many years wrote these reflections;” but, comparing\r\nthem with the two entries under the dates of October 14 and December\r\n16, 1738, and with his letter to his brother Samuel, dated October\r\n30, it would be folly to contend that he was not relating his own\r\nexperience. The reader must form his own opinion, and grapple with the\r\ndifficulties, thus presented, as he best can. Wesley acknowledges,\r\nin the above extract, that, some months before, he “received such a\r\nsense of the forgiveness of his sins as till then he never knew;” and\r\nyet here we find him full of doubt, and writing the bitterest things\r\nagainst himself.\r\n\r\nLet us pursue his correspondence with his brother Samuel a little\r\nfarther. Wesley held the doctrine of the Spirit’s witness; though\r\nhe asserts he did not yet experience it. Samuel, in a letter dated\r\nNovember 15, 1738, asks his brother “whether he will own or disown,\r\nin terms, the necessity of a sensible information from God of\r\npardon?”[251] This was not a fair putting of the question. Wesley\r\nhad defined the πληροφορια πιστεως, or witness of the Spirit, as “the\r\nlove of God shed abroad in the heart, producing joy which no man\r\ntaketh away; joy unspeakable and full of glory:” but his brother here\r\nchanges the term _witness_, and what it meant, to the term “_sensible\r\ninformation_,” that is, information received through the senses, thus\r\nconnecting with the witness visions and voices, and other Moravian\r\nfollies at that time rampant.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later Wesley replied to this:—\r\n\r\n    “I believe every Christian, who has not yet received it, should\r\n    pray for the witness of God’s Spirit that he is a child of God.\r\n    This witness, I believe, is necessary for my salvation. How far\r\n    invincible ignorance may excuse others I know not. But this,\r\n    you say, is delusive and dangerous, because it encourages and\r\n    abets idle visions and dreams. It may do this accidentally, but\r\n    not essentially; but this is no objection against it; for, in\r\n    the same way, weak minds may pervert to an idle use every truth\r\n    in the oracles of God. Such visions, indeed, as you mention are\r\n    given up; but does it follow that visions and dreams in general\r\n    are bad branches of a bad root? God forbid. This would prove\r\n    more than you desire.”[252]\r\n\r\nIn answer, Samuel, on December 13, declares that his brother\r\nmisinterprets the witness of the Spirit, and refers him to a sermon\r\nof Bishop Bull’s in proof. John replies, that Bishop Bull’s sermon is\r\nfull of gross perversions of Scripture; and adds: “I find more persons,\r\nday by day, who experience a clear evidence of their being in a state\r\nof salvation; but I never said this continues equally clear in all, as\r\nlong as they continue in a state of salvation.”[253]\r\n\r\nSamuel’s answer is dated Tiverton, March 26, 1739, in which he argues\r\nthat the witness of the Spirit is not necessary to salvation; and\r\nrefers, in proof of this, to the case of baptized infants, and to\r\npersons of a gloomy constitution.[254]\r\n\r\nNine days afterwards, Wesley re-asserted that he had seen many persons\r\nchanged in a moment from the spirit of horror, fear, and despair, to\r\nthe spirit of hope, joy, and peace; and from sinful desires, till\r\nthen reigning over them, to a pure desire of doing the will of God.\r\nHe also knew that this great change, in several persons, had been\r\nwrought either in sleep, or during a strong representation, to the eye\r\nof their minds, of Christ, either on the cross, or in glory. He also\r\nargues, that his brother’s reference to infants and persons of a gloomy\r\nconstitution fails to sustain his point; because no kind of assurance\r\nis essential to the salvation of infants; and persons of a gloomy\r\nconstitution, so far from being doomed to die without the assurance,\r\nhave, to his own certain knowledge, even when almost mad, been brought\r\nin a moment into a state of firm, lasting peace and joy.[255]\r\n\r\nOther letters might be quoted; but enough has been said to show the\r\nviews which Wesley now held concerning the witness of the Spirit. He\r\nbelieved the witness was necessary to his own salvation; and, yet, he\r\ndeclares he has it not. He asserts that he has known instances in which\r\nit has been granted in dreams; but he does not insist that dreams are\r\nan essential medium. The whole affair is puzzling. On May 24, 1738, he\r\n“received such a sense of the forgiveness of sins as till then he never\r\nknew;” and yet, months afterwards, he declares, in the most explicit\r\nterms, that he was now living without the enjoyment of the Spirit’s\r\nwitness. How is this discrepancy to be explained? Had he lost the sense\r\nof forgiveness which he received on May 24? Or was he attaching to\r\nthe witness of the Spirit a signification too high? If he had not the\r\nwitness at the beginning of 1739, when did he obtain it afterwards? All\r\nthese questions will naturally occur to the thoughtful reader; but they\r\nare more easily asked than answered.\r\n\r\nThe simple truth seems to be, that while Wesley heard much among the\r\nMoravians that was scriptural, he also heard much that was otherwise;\r\nand paid more attention to their experiences, both in England and in\r\nGermany, than was desirable, or for his good. His high opinion of the\r\npeople’s piety made it easy to believe even many of their foolish\r\nstatements. He got into a labyrinth, and could hardly tell where he\r\nwas. Months before, he had believed on Christ to the saving of his\r\nsoul; and yet now he bitterly exclaims that he is not a Christian.\r\nHe was, for a season, bewildered with the brightness of great truths\r\nbursting for the first time on his vision, and with the distracting\r\nglare of religious testimonies—new, but yet earnest and sincere—of\r\ngreat importance, and yet mixed with much that was fanatical and\r\nfoolish. Out of such a maze this earnest man had to find his way as he\r\nbest could. We know his subsequent career, and we know the doctrines\r\nthat he taught. The mists of early education, and the vapours of\r\nMoravian imagination, were soon scattered by the bright sunshine which\r\nwas shed upon him; and in the midst of which, to the end of his career,\r\nhe was wont to live, and to testify, “The testimony of the Spirit is\r\nan inward impression on the soul, whereby the Spirit of God directly\r\nwitnesses to my spirit that I am a child of God; that Jesus Christ hath\r\nloved me, and given Himself for me; and that all my sins are blotted\r\nout, and I, even I, am reconciled to God.”[256]\r\n\r\nWesley had been brought into strange communion with Moravians in his\r\nvoyage to Georgia. At Savannah he had met with Spangenberg. On his\r\nreturn to London he found Bohler, and was induced to become a member of\r\nthe first Moravian society, founded at Fetter Lane. The rules of that\r\nsociety are before us, entitled, “Orders of a Religious Society meeting\r\nin Fetter Lane; in obedience to the command of God by St. James, and\r\nby the advice of Peter Boehler, May 1, 1738.” These rules provide for\r\na meeting of the members once a week, to confess their faults one to\r\nanother, and to pray for one another that they may be healed. A month\r\nlater, it was agreed that the persons thus meeting in _society_ should\r\nbe divided into _bands_, of not fewer than five or more than ten;\r\nand that some one in each band should be desired to interrogate the\r\nrest, and should be called the leader. Each band was to meet twice a\r\nweek; every person was to come punctually at the hour appointed; every\r\nmeeting was to begin and end with singing and prayer; and all the bands\r\nwere to have a conference every Wednesday night. Any person absenting\r\nhimself from his band-meeting, without some extraordinary reason,\r\nwas to be first privately admonished, and if he were absent a second\r\ntime, to be reproved before the whole society. Any member, desiring\r\nor designing to take a journey, was first to have, if possible, the\r\napprobation of the bands; and all who were in clubs were requested to\r\nwithdraw their names from such associations. Any one desiring to be\r\nadmitted was to be asked his reasons for this, and whether he would be\r\nentirely open, using no kind of reserve, least of all in the case of\r\nlove or courtship. Every fourth Saturday was to be observed as a day\r\nof general intercession, from twelve to two, from three to five, and\r\nfrom six to eight o’clock; and, on one Sunday in every month, a general\r\nlovefeast was to be held from seven till ten at night. In order to a\r\ncontinual intercession, every member was to choose some hour, either of\r\nthe day or night, to spend in prayer, chiefly for his brethren; and, in\r\norder to a continual fast, three of the members were to fast every day,\r\nSundays and holidays excepted, and spend as much of the day as possible\r\nin retirement from business and in prayer. Each person was to pay to\r\nthe leader of his band, at least once a month, what he could afford\r\ntowards the general expenses; and any person not conforming to the\r\nrules of the society, after being thrice admonished, was to be expelled.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, Wesley wished to know something more of the singular\r\npeople with whom he had been brought in contact; and accordingly, three\r\nweeks after his conversion, he started for their chief settlement at\r\nHerrnhuth, in Germany. One of his companions was his friend Ingham, and\r\nanother was John Toltschig,[257] one of the first fugitives who fled to\r\nHerrnhuth from the fierce persecution in Moravia in 1724.\r\n\r\nAt Rotterdam, Dr. Koker, a physician, treated them with kindness; but\r\nat Gondart several of the inns refused to entertain them, and it “was\r\nwith difficulty they at last found one which did them the favour to\r\ntake their money for their meat and drink, and the use of two or three\r\nbad beds.”\r\n\r\nOn June 16, they arrived at Ysselstein, the home of Baron Watteville,\r\nwho had been a fellow student of Count Zinzendorf, and one of the young\r\ngentlemen, at the academy in Halle, who about the year 1717 had formed\r\nan association called “The Order of the Grain of Mustard Seed,” the\r\nobject of which was to promote the conversion of Jews and heathen.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Wesley’s visit Watteville was at the head of “a few\r\nGerman brethren and sisters, and about eight” English Moravians, who\r\nwere living in three or four small houses, till one should be built\r\nlarge enough to contain them all. Wesley and his friends spent a day\r\nwith them “in hearing the wonderful work which God was beginning to\r\nwork over all the earth,” and in making prayer to Him, “and giving\r\nthanks for the mightiness of His kingdom.”\r\n\r\nProceeding to Amsterdam, Wesley and his companions were received with\r\ngreat courtesy by Mr. Decknatel, a minister of the Mennonists, and\r\nDr. Barkhausen, a Muscovite physician. Here they spent four days, and\r\nattended several society meetings, where “the expounding was in high\r\nDutch.”\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, June 26, they reached Cologne, “the ugliest, dirtiest city”\r\nWesley had ever seen. The cathedral he describes as “mere heaps upon\r\nheaps; a huge, misshapen thing, without either symmetry or neatness\r\nbelonging to it.” Some will doubtless differ from Wesley’s judgment\r\nconcerning this magnificent though unfinished pile, so venerated for\r\nits sanctity, derived from the monkish stories of the reliques of the\r\neleven thousand virgins and of the three eastern kings. Coming out of\r\nit, one of Wesley’s companions scrupled to take off his hat as a popish\r\nprocession passed, when a papist cried, “Knock down the Lutheran dog,”\r\na mandate which would probably have been put into execution if the\r\noffender had not made a timely escape from the zealot’s fury.\r\n\r\nEmbarking on the majestic Rhine, four days and nights were spent in\r\nreaching Mayence, the boat in which Wesley travelled being drawn\r\nby horses. This, however, gave him ample time to admire the almost\r\nunequalled beauties of one of the finest rivers in the world. Arriving\r\nfaint and weary at Frankfort, they were refused admittance, because\r\nthey had no passports. It so happened, however, that Peter Bohler’s\r\nfather was resident in the city; and, by his interposition, they\r\nprocured an entrance, and were treated in the most friendly manner.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, July 4, they came to Marienborn, (about thirty-five miles\r\nfrom Frankfort,) in the neighbourhood of which Zinzendorf, two years\r\nbefore, had taken up his residence in an old, ruinous castle called\r\nRonneburg, and where he had established schools for poor children,\r\nwhom he fed and clothed at his own expense. Here also he had formed\r\na missionary congregation, consisting of forty students from Jena,\r\nmost of whom became ministers either in Europe or in missions to the\r\nheathen.[258] The Moravian family altogether consisted of about ninety\r\npersons, all living in a large house rented by Zinzendorf. Here Wesley\r\nspent a fortnight, conversing with the brethren in Latin or English,\r\nlistening to the sermons of the count, and attending conferences and\r\nintercession meetings. Writing to his brother Samuel, he says: “God has\r\ngiven me at length the desire of my heart. I am with a church whose\r\nconversation is in heaven; in whom is the mind that was in Christ, and\r\nwho so walks as He walked. As they have all one Lord and one faith,\r\nso they are all partakers of one Spirit—the spirit of meekness and\r\nlove, which uniformly and continually animates all their conversation.\r\nI believe, in a week, Mr. Ingham and I shall set out for Herrnhuth,\r\nabout three hundred and fifty miles hence. Oh pray for us, that God\r\nwould sanctify to us all those precious opportunities.”[259] It is an\r\nodd fact, however, that while Ingham was allowed to partake of the\r\nholy communion, Wesley was not, because “the congregation saw him to\r\nbe _homo perturbatus_, and that his head had gained an ascendancy over\r\nhis heart”; and also because “they were desirous not to interfere with\r\nhis plan of effecting good as a clergyman of the English Church.”[260]\r\nPeculiar reasons—but we give them as we find them. Hampson, in his\r\nlife of Wesley, relates that Zinzendorf, who regarded him as a pupil,\r\nordered him one day to dig in the garden; and after Wesley had been\r\nthere for some time working in his shirt, and when he was in a high\r\nstate of perspiration, the lordly count commanded him to enter a\r\ncarriage that was waiting, to pay a visit to a neighbouring noble.\r\nWesley naturally wished to wash his hands and to put on his coat; but\r\nhis preceptor forbade him, saying, “You must be simple, my brother!”\r\nThis was a full answer to all remonstrance, and Wesley was simple\r\nenough to obey the mandate of a man who, while professing great\r\nhumility, sometimes allowed the pretensions of his feudal pride to set\r\naside the meekness of his professed piety.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of July, Wesley again set out, and on reaching Weimar\r\nwas brought before the duke, who asked his object in journeying to\r\nHerrnhuth. Wesley answered, “To see the place where the Christians\r\nlive;” upon which the duke looked hard, but permitted him to go. On\r\narriving at Halle, “the King of Prussia’s tall men,” who kept the\r\ngates, sent him and his friends backwards and forwards, from one gate\r\nto another, for nearly two long hours before they were admitted. Here\r\nhe inspected, with the greatest interest, the Orphan House of August\r\nHerman Francke, in which six hundred and fifty children were wholly\r\nresident, and three thousand taught. At Leipsig, the gentlemen of\r\nthe university treated him with respect and kindness. At Meissen,\r\ntwo things surprised him—the extremely beautiful china ware; and the\r\ncongregation in the church, where the women wore huge fur caps in the\r\nshape of Turkish turbans; the men sat with their hats on their heads at\r\nthe prayers as well as at the sermon, and the parson was decorated with\r\na habit bedecked with gold and scarlet, and with a vast cross on both\r\nhis back and breast. At Dresden, Wesley was carried from one official\r\nto another, with impertinent solemnity, for above two hours, before he\r\nwas suffered to settle at his inn; and greatly wondered that common\r\nsense and common humanity allowed such a senseless, inhuman usage of\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nWesley arrived at the Moravian settlement at Herrnhuth on August 1, and\r\nfound it consisting of about a hundred houses built on a rising ground.\r\nThe principal erection was the orphan house, in the lower part of which\r\nwas the apothecary’s shop, and in the upper the chapel, capable of\r\ncontaining six or seven hundred people. Here he spent nearly the next\r\nfortnight.\r\n\r\nThe day after his arrival, he attended a lovefeast of the married\r\nwomen; and on every day, at eleven, a Bible conference, at which was\r\nread a portion of Scripture in the original. He was also present\r\nat a conference for strangers, when several questions concerning\r\njustification were resolved. He embraced all opportunities of\r\nconversing with the most experienced of the brethren, concerning the\r\ngreat work which God had wrought within them; and with the teachers and\r\nelders concerning their church discipline.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday, after the evening service, all the unmarried women,\r\naccording to their usual custom, walked round the town, singing\r\npraise, with instruments of music; and then, on a small hill, at a\r\nlittle distance from it, knelt in a circle and joined in prayer; after\r\nwhich they joyously repaired to their respective homes.\r\n\r\nFour times Wesley heard Christian David preach, and also received from\r\nhis own lips his private history. The boyhood of this remarkable man\r\nwas spent in tending sheep, and his youth and early manhood partly\r\nat the carpenter’s bench, and partly in the soldier’s tent. He was\r\na zealous papist, and crawled on his knees before images, performed\r\npenances, invoked departed saints, and went the whole round of\r\nRomish vagaries. He was twenty years old before he had even seen a\r\nBible; after this, it became nearly the only book he read. The Bible\r\nconvinced him of the errors of Popery, and he resolved to join the\r\nLutherans. At the age of twenty-seven, he began to preach to his\r\ncountrymen; numbers were converted by his artless sermons; persecution\r\nfollowed; the converts fled; and Herrnhuth was founded. Christian\r\nDavid continued preaching in Moravia, until his preaching became the\r\ntopic of conversation in houses, streets, roads, and markets, and\r\nthe whole country was thrown into a state of great excitement. The\r\npeople assembled at each other’s houses to sing hymns and to read the\r\nBible. Shepherds chanted the praises of their Redeemer as they kept\r\ntheir flocks; servants at their work talked of nothing but His great\r\nsalvation; and children on village greens poured out their fervent\r\nprayers before Him. Many were imprisoned; others were thrust into\r\ncellars and made to stand in water till they were well-nigh frozen;\r\nnot a few were loaded with irons and obliged to work as convicts;\r\nand a whole host were condemned to pay heavy fines. All this arose\r\nout of the preaching of the unlettered preacher whom Wesley heard at\r\nHerrnhuth,—the _Bush Preacher_, as he was called by the persecuting\r\npriests and jesuits of Moravia,—the man who, five years previous to\r\nWesley’s present visit, conducted the first missionaries to Greenland,\r\nand who, though but a poor mechanic, preached to the court of the\r\nking of Denmark as he went,—an itinerant evangelist of no mean order,\r\nhaving paid eleven gospel visits to Moravia, three to Greenland, and\r\nmany others to Denmark, England, and Holland, besides visiting all the\r\nMoravian congregations throughout the whole of Germany,—a man who,\r\nwhen he happened to be at home at Herrnhuth, and not engaged in active\r\nservices for the church, always followed his trade as a carpenter,\r\nand secured the respect and love of both young and old,—a man who\r\noften made mistakes, but was always ready to confess his errors when\r\npointed out to him,—deeply devoted to the work of Christ, and living\r\nin the closest communion with Him,—shunning no toil, and fearing no\r\ndanger,—reading the Bible continually, and never tiring of its precious\r\ntruths,—his sermons wanting in polish, but not in power,—for more than\r\nthirty years an itinerant, out-door German preacher,—and who in 1751,\r\nat the age of sixty, went triumphantly to heaven.[261]\r\n\r\nSuch was the preaching mechanic whom Wesley, the scholar and the\r\npriest, embraced every opportunity of hearing during his Herrnhuth\r\nvisit,—a fair specimen of scores in England whom Wesley, during the\r\nnext half-century, employed in the same glorious work. The philosopher\r\nmay sneer at the sight of one of the most distinguished fellows of\r\nLincoln College sitting in the Herrnhuth chapel and in the carpenter’s\r\ncottage, to be taught by a man like this; but let it be remembered that\r\nwhile the Oxford student, in letters, was immeasurably superior to the\r\nGerman mechanic, the German mechanic was as much superior to the Oxford\r\nstudent in the science of saving truth; and besides that, he spoke not\r\nonly from clear convictions, but from personal experience. Even now\r\nmany a man, profoundly learned in languages and in philosophy, might\r\nreceive knowledge more important than any he already has, if he would\r\ncondescend to imitate Wesley’s example, and stoop to be taught by some\r\npoor itinerating preacher, who, though a wayfaring man, and in all\r\nother things a fool, is yet “wise unto salvation through faith which is\r\nin Christ Jesus.”\r\n\r\nThe four sermons which Wesley heard Christian David preach were\r\npeculiarly appropriate to his present religious state. It is a notable\r\nfact, however, that instead of instructing Wesley to expect the witness\r\nof the Spirit immediately, he taught him “that many are children of\r\nGod and heirs of the promises, long before they are comforted by the\r\nabiding witness of the Spirit, melting their souls into all gentleness\r\nand meekness; and much more before they are pure in heart from all\r\nself-will and sin.” Christian David told Wesley, in private, that he\r\nhad “the forgiveness of sins, and a measure of the peace of God, for\r\nmany years before he had that witness of the Spirit which shut out\r\nall doubt and fear.” This is not _Wesleyan_ doctrine; but it was the\r\ndoctrine which Wesley was taught in Germany, and which helped to keep\r\nhim in that doubting and fearing state in which we have already seen\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWesley elicited the religious experience of Michael Linner, the oldest\r\nmember of the church, which was to the effect that Michael believed to\r\nthe saving of his soul two years before he received the full assurance\r\nof faith; though he admitted that the more usual method is for the\r\nHoly Spirit “to give, in one and the same moment, the forgiveness of\r\nsins, and a full assurance of that forgiveness.” David Nitschmann, one\r\nof the four public teachers of the Herrnhuth community, told Wesley\r\nthat, for years after he was delivered from the bondage of sin, he was\r\ntroubled with doubts and fears. Martin Döber stated: “It is common for\r\npersons to receive justification through faith in the blood of Christ\r\nbefore they receive the full assurance of faith, which God many times\r\nwithholds till He has tried whether they will work together with Him in\r\nthe use of the first gift.” Augustine Neusser said he could not tell\r\nthe hour or day when he first received the full assurance that his sins\r\nwere pardoned; for it was not given at once, but grew within him by\r\ndegrees. David Schneider’s experience was substantially the same; but\r\nit is right to add, that the experience of others was of a brighter\r\nkind, and confirmative of the scriptural doctrine that, when sins are\r\nforgiven, the Spirit, at the same moment, gives the assurance of it.\r\n\r\nWesley eagerly listened to the recital of these religious experiences\r\nat Herrnhuth, and became bewildered; and hence those puzzling\r\ndeclarations concerning his own religious state, even down to the\r\nbeginning of 1739, which have been already given. The truth is, both\r\nWesley and the Moravians seemed to confound the doctrine of the\r\nSpirit’s witness with the doctrine of sanctification. Because they\r\nwere not, for a season, wholly sanctified, they declare that they had\r\nnot the witness of the Spirit or the full assurance of faith. The\r\nfollowing, for instance, is Arvid Gradin’s description of that witness\r\nor assurance: “Repose in the blood of Christ; a firm confidence in God,\r\nand persuasion of His favour; serene peace and steadfast tranquillity\r\nof mind, with a deliverance from every fleshly desire, and from every\r\noutward and inward sin.” This is a beautiful description of what the\r\nMethodists mean by entire sanctification; but Wesley, taught by the\r\nHerrnhuth Moravians, confounded it, for a time, with what he called\r\n“the witness of the Spirit,—full assurance of faith;” the result being\r\nthe use of language, in reference to himself, quite sufficient to\r\nperplex the modern Methodist, who, without paying attention to these\r\nMoravian facts, contents himself with merely comparing the lucid\r\nlanguage of Wesley’s sermons with the confused and confusing language\r\nof those parts of Wesley’s journal to which we are now adverting.\r\n\r\nWesley spent nearly a fortnight among the Herrnhuth Christians. He\r\nwrites:—“I would gladly have spent my life here. Oh when shall this\r\nChristianity cover the earth, as the waters cover the sea?” The\r\npopulation was divided into about ninety bands, each of which met twice\r\nat least, but most of them three times, a week, to “confess their\r\nfaults one to another, and to pray for one another that they might\r\nbe healed.” The rulers of the church had a conference every week,\r\npurely concerning the state of souls; and another every day on the\r\noutward matters of the church. Once a week, there was a conference for\r\nstrangers; at which any one might be present, and propose questions\r\nor doubts which he desired to have resolved. The children and young\r\npeople were taught reading, writing, arithmetic, Latin, Greek, Hebrew,\r\nFrench, English, history, and geography. Every morning at eight,\r\nthe community had singing, Scripture exposition, and commonly short\r\nprayer; and the same at eight in the evening, concluding each service\r\nwith the kiss of peace. On Sundays, service began at six; at nine,\r\nthey had public worship at Bertholdsdorf; at one, the members of\r\nthe church were divided into fourteen classes, to each of which was\r\naddressed a separate exhortation; at four, there was service again at\r\nBertholdsdorf; and at eight, the usual nightly service; after which the\r\nyoung men went round the town singing songs of praise; and thus the\r\nday was ended. On the first Saturday of every month, the Lord’s supper\r\nwas administered: when, from ten till two, the eldest spoke with each\r\ncommunicant in private, concerning his or her spiritual experience;\r\nat two, they dined, and then washed one another’s feet; after which\r\nthey sung and prayed; about ten at night, they received the communion\r\nin silence without any ceremony; and continued without speaking, till\r\nmidnight, when they parted. The second Saturday was occupied as the\r\nsolemn prayer-day for the children. The third was a day of general\r\nintercession and thanksgiving. And the fourth was the great monthly\r\nconference of all the superiors of the church. For the last eleven\r\nyears, they had kept up a perpetual intercession, which had never\r\nceased day or night, by different companies spending in succession\r\nan hour every day in prayer for themselves and for other churches.\r\nMarriage was highly reverenced, and no young people were allowed to\r\nbe affianced without being placed for a time with married persons,\r\nwho instructed them how to behave in their contemplated new relation.\r\nCasting lots was used both in public and private, to decide points\r\nof importance, when the reasons on each side appeared to be of equal\r\nweight. The time usually spent in sleep was from eleven at night till\r\nfour in the morning; three hours a day were allowed for meals; leaving\r\nsixteen for work and sacred services.\r\n\r\nSuch was Herrnhuth in 1738, the cradle of the modern Moravian\r\nchurch,—the Jerusalem of the United Brethren. At present it has about\r\na thousand inhabitants, is well built, well paved, and scrupulously\r\nclean; having in its centre a large square, in which stands the hall\r\nfor worship, at the original consecration of which Zinzendorf offered\r\nthe striking prayer, “May God prevent this house standing longer than\r\nit continues to be a dwelling place of love and peace to the praise of\r\nthe Redeemer!” On one side of the square is what was once the residence\r\nof Zinzendorf, now the depôt of Moravian archives; on another, the\r\nhouse of the unmarried brethren; and on a third, the village inn, the\r\nproperty of the community. Connection with the brotherhood, except in\r\nspecial cases conceded by their church authorities, is a condition of\r\nresidence in the town; and up to 1848, by the laws of Saxony, any one\r\nwho forsook the faith could be compelled to sell whatever property he\r\nhad within its boundaries. This is now altered, and the only compulsion\r\nthat can be exercised is of a moral character. Still, even yet, with\r\nthe exception of the government officials, and a few privileged\r\nindividuals, the entire community are members of the Moravian church.\r\nHere sprang up that wondrous brotherhood, which, whilst other churches\r\nwere surrendering the great doctrines of the cross, devoted its life\r\nand energies to their world-wide propagation, and, with a faith\r\nwhich to some seemed presumption, and a love which approached to the\r\ncharacter of a reverential friendship, went among slumbering peoples\r\nand savage races, insisting on the necessity of personal faith in a\r\npersonal Redeemer, and declaring that life in Christ is the highest\r\nlife of man.[262]\r\n\r\nWesley left Herrnhuth on August 12, and reached London on Saturday,\r\nSeptember 16. He at once resumed his work by preaching thrice the next\r\nday, and afterwards expounding in the Minories. On Monday, he rejoiced\r\nto meet with the Moravian society at Fetter Lane, which had increased\r\nfrom ten members to thirty-two; and, on Tuesday, he went to the\r\ncondemned felons in Newgate, and preached to them a free salvation.\r\n\r\nA month subsequent to his return, he wrote as follows to his Herrnhuth\r\nfriends:—\r\n\r\n    “To the church of God which is in Herrnhuth, John Wesley, an\r\n    unworthy presbyter of the church of God in England, wisheth\r\n    all grace and peace in our Lord Jesus Christ. Glory be to God,\r\n    even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! for giving me to be\r\n    an eye-witness of your faith and love and holy conversation in\r\n    Christ Jesus. We are endeavouring here to be followers of you,\r\n    as ye are of Christ. Fourteen have been added to us since our\r\n    return, so that we have now eight bands, all of whom seek for\r\n    salvation only in the blood of Christ. As yet, we have only\r\n    two small bands of women; the one of three, the other of five\r\n    persons. But here are many others, who only wait till we have\r\n    leisure to instruct them how they may most effectually build up\r\n    one another in the faith and love of Him who gave Himself for\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n    “Though my brother and I are not permitted to preach in most of\r\n    the churches in London, yet there are others left, wherein we\r\n    have liberty to speak the truth as it is in Jesus. Likewise,\r\n    every evening, and on set evenings in the week, at two several\r\n    places, we publish the word of reconciliation, sometimes to\r\n    twenty or thirty, sometimes to fifty or sixty, sometimes to\r\n    three or four hundred persons, met together to hear it. We\r\n    begin and end all our meetings with singing and prayer; and we\r\n    know that our Lord heareth prayer, having more than once or\r\n    twice received our petitions in that very hour.\r\n\r\n    “Nor hath He left Himself without other witnesses of His grace\r\n    and truth. Ten ministers I know now in England, who lay the\r\n    right foundation, ‘the blood of Christ cleanseth us from all\r\n    sin.’ Over and above whom I have found one Anabaptist, and one,\r\n    if not two, of the teachers among the Presbyterians here, who I\r\n    hope love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, and teach the way\r\n    of God in truth.”[263]\r\n\r\nThere are three facts in the above quotation which deserve notice:—1.\r\nThat Wesley was thoroughly identified with the London Moravians. 2.\r\nThat there were other clergymen besides himself who were evangelical.\r\n3. That he still retained his high church nonsense, and made a\r\ndifference between Church of England “_ministers_,” and Anabaptist and\r\nPresbyterian “_teachers_.” This last was pitiable folly, perhaps not to\r\nbe wondered at, and yet deserving to be despised.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, Wesley wrote to Zinzendorf at Marienborn, thanking\r\nhim and his countess for their kindness, and then adding:—\r\n\r\n    “I did not return hither at all before the time; for though a\r\n    great door and effectual had been opened, the adversaries had\r\n    laid so many stumbling-blocks before it, that the weak were\r\n    daily turned out of the way. Numberless misunderstandings had\r\n    arisen, by means of which the way of truth was much blasphemed;\r\n    and, hence, had sprung anger, clamour, bitterness, evil\r\n    speaking, envyings, strifes, railings, evil surmises; whereby\r\n    the enemy had gained such an advantage over the little flock,\r\n    that ‘of the rest durst no man join himself to them.’ But it\r\n    has now pleased our blessed Master to remove, in great measure,\r\n    these rocks of offence. The word of the Lord again runs and is\r\n    glorified; and this work goes on and prospers. Great multitudes\r\n    are everywhere awakened, and cry out, ‘What must we do to\r\n    be saved?’ The love and zeal of our brethren in Holland and\r\n    Germany, particularly at Herrnhuth, have stirred up many among\r\n    us, who will not be comforted till they also partake of the\r\n    great and precious promises. I hope to see them at least once\r\n    more, were it only to speak freely on a few things which I did\r\n    not approve, perhaps because I did not understand them.”[264]\r\n\r\nThe last sentence requires explanation. Notwithstanding his general\r\nadmiration of the German Moravians, their sun was not without spots,\r\nfor there were sundry things with which Wesley was not satisfied. What\r\nwere they? Wesley himself shall answer. The following is an unfinished\r\nletter, written to the Moravians at Marienborn and Herrnhuth, a few\r\ndays only after Wesley’s return from Germany, but which was never sent:—\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR BRETHREN,—I cannot but rejoice in your stedfast faith,\r\n    in your love to our blessed Redeemer, your deadness to the\r\n    world, your meekness, temperance, chastity, and love of one\r\n    another. I greatly approve of your conferences and bands; of\r\n    your methods of instructing children; and, in general, of your\r\n    great care of the souls committed to your charge.\r\n\r\n    “But of some other things I stand in doubt, which I will\r\n    mention in love and meekness.\r\n\r\n    “Is not the count all in all among you?\r\n\r\n    “Do you not magnify your own church too much?\r\n\r\n    “Do you not use guile and dissimulation in many cases?\r\n\r\n    “Are you not of a close, dark, reserved temper and\r\n    behaviour?”[265]\r\n\r\nThese were weighty accusations, and will claim attention hereafter.\r\n\r\nWithin five weeks after Wesley had returned from Germany, he and his\r\nbrother Charles waited upon Dr. Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London, to\r\nanswer the complaints he had heard against them, to the effect that\r\nthey preached an absolute assurance of salvation. Gibson was a man\r\nof great natural abilities, a laborious student, and also pious; but\r\nhe was occasionally betrayed into intolerance, and sometimes evinced\r\nmore zeal for the rights of the Church than discretion. So great was\r\nhis ecclesiastical power, that Sir Robert Walpole was accustomed to be\r\nreproached with allowing him the authority of a pope: “And a very good\r\npope he is,” replied the premier. The two Wesleys being introduced to\r\nhim, he said, “If by assurance you mean an inward persuasion, whereby\r\na man is conscious in himself, after examining his life by the law\r\nof God, and weighing his own sincerity, that he is in a state of\r\nsalvation, and acceptable to God, I don’t see how any good Christian\r\ncan be without such assurance.” The Wesleys meant more by “assurance”\r\nthan this; but the doctrine, so far as it went, was one which they\r\nthemselves preached. The next point discussed was the charge that\r\nthey were Antinomians, because they preached justification by faith\r\nonly. To this they replied, “Can any one preach otherwise, who agrees\r\nto our church and the Scriptures?” A third charge was that they had\r\nadministered baptism to persons dissatisfied with the lay baptism which\r\nthey had already received. Wesley answered, with more high church\r\nbigotry than scriptural enlightenment, that “if a person dissatisfied\r\nwith lay baptism,” or, in other words, Dissenters’ baptism, “should\r\ndesire episcopal, he should think it his duty to administer it.”\r\nWesley next inquired of his lordship if “his reading in a religious\r\nsociety made it a conventicle;” and whether “religious societies are\r\nconventicles.” To the latter question the bishop answered, “I think\r\nnot; but I determine nothing;” and he recommended them to read the acts\r\nand laws on the subject for themselves. They then requested that he\r\nwould not, in future, receive an accusation against them, but at the\r\nmouth of two or three witnesses. He said, “No, by no means; and you may\r\nhave free access to me at all times.” They thanked his lordship, and\r\ndeparted.[266]\r\n\r\nThis was the first muttering of the storm soon to burst upon them.\r\nWilliam Warburton was not yet a bishop, but he was already a vigorous\r\nand well known writer, and rector of Brand Broughton, in Lincolnshire.\r\nThis hot-headed parson was one of the first to fall foul upon the poor\r\nMethodists. Writing to Des Maizeaux, in 1738, he says:—\r\n\r\n    “What think you of our new set of fanatics, called the\r\n    Methodists? There is one Wesley, who told a friend of mine,\r\n    that he had lived most deliciously last summer in Georgia,\r\n    sleeping under trees, and feeding on boiled maize, sauced with\r\n    the ashes of oak leaves; and that he will return thither, and\r\n    then will cast off his English dress, and wear a dried skin,\r\n    like the savages, the better to ingratiate himself with them.\r\n    It would be well for virtue and religion if this humour would\r\n    lay hold generally of our overheated bigots, and send them to\r\n    cool themselves in the Indian marshes.”\r\n\r\nIn another letter, written in the same year to Dr. Birch, he says:—\r\n\r\n    “A couple of these Methodists, of whom Wesley was one,\r\n    travelling into this neighbourhood on foot, took up their\r\n    lodging with a clergyman of their acquaintance. The master of\r\n    the house going into their chamber in the morning to salute\r\n    them, perceived a certain vessel full of blood, and, on asking\r\n    the occasion, was told it was _their method_, when the blood\r\n    grew rebellious, to draw it off by breathing a vein; that they\r\n    had been heated with travel, and thought it proper to cool\r\n    themselves.”[267]\r\n\r\nSuch are specimens of the foul falsehoods which malignant men already\r\ncirculated concerning Wesley and his companions. But, besides this, the\r\nMethodist movement began to be noticed by the pulpit. The Rev. Tipping\r\nSilvester, M.A., Fellow of Pembroke College, Oxford, and Lecturer of\r\nSt. Bartholomew the Great, London, preached a sermon on regeneration\r\nbefore the university of Oxford, at St. Mary’s, on February 26, which,\r\nwithout mentioning the names of the Methodist leaders, was evidently\r\nmeant to be an antidote to one of their distinguished doctrines. The\r\nsermon was published, 8vo, twenty-eight pages, and on the title page\r\nwas “recommended to the religious societies.” The chief point in the\r\nsermon is that infants are born again in baptism.\r\n\r\nAnother sermon, on “The Doctrine of Assurance,” was delivered on August\r\n13, in the church of St. Lawrence Jewry, by the Rev. Arthur Bedford,\r\nM.A., chaplain to his royal highness Frederick Prince of Wales. This\r\nalso, with an appendix, was published, 8vo, thirty-nine pages, and\r\nhad an extensive circulation. It was avowedly intended to refute the\r\ndoctrine of “those who had of late asserted that they who are not\r\nassured of their salvation, by a revelation from the Holy Ghost, are\r\nin a state of damnation.” The preacher argues that this assurance “is\r\ngiven to very few, and perhaps only to such whom God calls either to\r\nextraordinary services, or to extraordinary sufferings.” He further\r\nargues that to profess to have received such an assurance savours of\r\nspiritual pride, and cannot but produce bad results.\r\n\r\nThese were the first sermons published against the doctrines of\r\nMethodism, and both of them were extremely temperate when compared with\r\nothers following.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year 1738, Wesley drew up a set of rules for the\r\nregulation of the Moravian band societies, some of which were\r\ncertainly more inquisitive than wise. Eleven questions, to be proposed\r\nto candidates for admission, were, upon the whole, unexceptionable;\r\nbut five others, to be asked of every member at every weekly meeting,\r\nsavour far too much of the popish confessional to be admired. We give\r\nthem as an indication of the still unhealthy tone of Wesley’s piety:—\r\n\r\n“1. What known sins have you committed since our last meeting?\r\n\r\n“2. What temptations have you met with?\r\n\r\n“3. How were you delivered?\r\n\r\n“4. What have you thought, said, or done, of which you doubt whether it\r\nbe sin or not?\r\n\r\n“5. Have you nothing you desire to keep secret?”[268]\r\n\r\nNo doubt, such questions were put with the best intentions; but the\r\nthing looked like a prurient prying into secrets which properly belong\r\nalone to a man and his Maker.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Wesley’s publications, during 1738, have been already\r\nnoticed, except “A Collection of Psalms and Hymns,” eighty-four pages,\r\n12mo. This small volume was published without the name of either\r\nprinter or author; but it contains ample internal evidence of its\r\norigin. Its publication was contemplated immediately after Wesley’s\r\nreturn from Georgia; and hence the following extract from a letter\r\nwritten by Dr. Byrom to Charles Wesley, on the 3rd of March, 1738.\r\n\r\n    “As your brother has brought so many hymns translated from the\r\n    French, you will have a sufficient number, and no occasion to\r\n    increase them by the small addition of Mademoiselle Bourignon’s\r\n    two little pieces. I desire you to favour my present weakness,\r\n    if I judge wrong, and not to publish them.\r\n\r\n    “I do not at all desire to discourage your publication. But\r\n    when you tell me you write, not for the critic, but for the\r\n    Christian, it occurs to my mind that you might as well write\r\n    for _both_; or in such a manner that the critic may, by your\r\n    writing, be moved to turn Christian, rather than the Christian\r\n    turn critic. I should be wanting, I fear, in speaking freely\r\n    and friendly upon this matter, if I did not give it as my\r\n    humble opinion that, before you publish, you might lay before\r\n    some experienced Christian critics the design which you are\r\n    upon. But I speak this with all submission. It is very likely\r\n    that, in these matters, I may want a spur more than you want a\r\n    bridle.”[269]\r\n\r\nThe book was probably intended for the use of the Moravian bands and\r\nother religious societies’ meetings in London, with which Wesley was\r\nmore or less connected. It contains seventy psalms and hymns; but it is\r\na remarkable fact that not one of them seems to have been written by\r\nWesley’s brother Charles. One each is contributed by Addison, Dryden,\r\nand Lord Roscommon. One is from the Church liturgy, and one anonymous.\r\nThree are by Bishop Ken; four by Norris; six by Herbert; thirteen by\r\nTate and Brady; thirty-three by Watts; and six are translations by\r\nWesley himself. The book was never reprinted; but it formed the basis\r\nof another hymn-book, published three years after, in which exactly\r\none-half of its psalms and hymns were embodied.[270] It was the\r\nfirst[271] of about forty hymnologies published by the two brothers\r\nduring the next half-century, and which, as priceless gems, were\r\nscattered broadcast among the first Methodists.\r\n\r\nWith Wesley’s first hymn-book we close the first section of his\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n1739.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1739 Age 36]\r\n\r\nLondon in 1739 was widely different from what it is at present. The\r\npopulation, including Westminster and all the parishes within the\r\nBills of Mortality, was about 600,000, or a fifth of the population\r\nnow. London Bridge was the only highway across the majestic Thames\r\nthat the Londoners possessed; and that was covered with antique\r\nhouses, from end to end, forming a sort of picturesque extension of\r\nGracechurch Street, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore,—a narrow,\r\ndarksome, and dangerous thoroughfare with an arched gateway at each\r\nend of it, generally bristling with spikes, and often adorned with\r\nthe heads of traitors. The site of the present Mansion House was\r\na fruit market, having on one side of it a row of shady trees and\r\non the other a conduit, surmounted by an equestrian statue of King\r\nCharles II. Islington, Hoxton, Hackney, and Bethnal Green were country\r\nvillages. On the Surrey side, all beyond the King’s Bench prison was\r\nfields and open country. The Elephant and Castle stands where the\r\nsmall hamlet of Newington then stood. Walworth, Camberwell, Brixton,\r\nPeckham, and Clapham were rural haunts, far from the hum and noise\r\nof the great city. Even Lambeth was a vast conglomerated garden,\r\nextending from Kennington Common to what is now Westminster Bridge.\r\nEastward—Blackwall, Poplar, Bow, and Stepney were somewhat distant\r\ncollections of scattered houses, surrounded respectively by fields and\r\ngardens. Westward—Chelsea, Knightsbridge, Marylebone, and Tottenham\r\nCourt were all in open country. Even Belgravia was a farm of arable and\r\npasture land; while all the space, between Westminster and what is now\r\nVauxhall Bridge, was a dreary tract of stunted, dusty, trodden grass,\r\nthe resort of badgerbaiters and other rampant blackguards, and known\r\nby the name of Tothill Fields.\r\n\r\nMoorfields, the scene of Wesley’s earliest evangelistic labours, and\r\nwhere he opened his Foundery meeting-house, was what would now-a-days\r\nbe called a park, laid out in grass plots, intersected by broad gravel\r\nwalks, and the favourite resort of citizens seeking exercise and\r\nrecreation. Beneath a row of well grown elms was what the promenaders\r\ndesignated “the city mall,” and which in the smartness of its company\r\noften rivalled the mall of St. James’s Park. Here might be seen wives\r\nand daughters flaunting in all their finery and displaying their charms\r\nto city maccaronis, whose hats were cocked diagonally, and who gave\r\nthemselves quite as many airs as the aristocratic coxcombs in the royal\r\ngrounds. Under the trees were booths, whose fans, toys, trinkets, and\r\nconfectionery found ready purchasers; while on the grass plots were\r\nerected mountebank diversions for the amusement of the people.\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast between London then and London now! And yet, even then,\r\nLondon was thought to be dangerously too large. An able writer, in one\r\nof the magazines for 1762, argued that great cities are perilous to a\r\nnation’s welfare; and in proof quoted Nineveh, Babylon, Persepolis,\r\nTyre, Carthage, Rome, Athens, Memphis, Baalbec, Palmyra, Thebes,\r\nJerusalem, etc. He contended that it was pernicious policy to suffer\r\nthe eighth part of an entire nation to live in one crowded town; for\r\nwhen so many myriads lived on ground which produced nothing they were\r\nunder the necessity of living by their wits—that is, by sharping and\r\nover-reaching, and by inventing idle and vicious amusements. Hence\r\nit was that in London there was such a multiplication of playhouses,\r\noperas, ridottos, and masquerades; and that almost one-half of some of\r\nthe London parishes was converted into brothels by bawds and pimps. The\r\nanonymous alarmist was doubtless treated with contempt, but his theory\r\ndeserves attention.\r\n\r\nLondon was great, but it was wicked. And no wonder. Riches in the case\r\nof nations, as in the case of individuals, often lead to extravagance\r\nand luxury. Thus it was in England, in the reign of the second George.\r\nSuperb edifices rose up on every hand, almost vieing with the palaces\r\nof princes. Carriages, glittering with gold and crystal, rattled\r\nover city pavements with the utmost ostentation. Ridottos, balls,\r\nmasquerades, and midnight banquets, were of constant occurrence.\r\nEvery night innumerable lamps illuminated public gardens, where hosts\r\nof fashionable and licentious fops might be seen lolling in gilded\r\nalcoves, killing time, and lulling their senses into an indolent\r\noblivion. Arrayed in masks and the strangest dresses, gamblers, actors,\r\nand prostitutes mingled with persons of riches and of rank, and, amid\r\nthe din of music and of dancing, conversed obscene discourse, and\r\nwhispered indecent slanders. All classes caught the contagion, and\r\neven the tables of shopkeepers and mechanics were covered with costly\r\ndainties. Clerks and apprentices, servant-maids and cooks, decked\r\nthemselves in apparel equal to that of their masters and mistresses;\r\nand finical sparks deemed it their privilege and right to frequent\r\ntaverns, clubs, and theatres, adorned with the finest clothes, perukes,\r\nand jewellery.\r\n\r\nWhat resulted from all this? Extravagance created greater wants than\r\nthe people had means to meet. Patrimonial estates, and the gains of\r\nhonest business were not enough to satisfy newly engendered appetites;\r\nand hence men appealed to an infernal sorceress, to correct, forsooth,\r\nthe errors made in distributing the gifts of Providence. To eke out\r\nmeans which were found too scanty to gratify licentious and luxurious\r\npassions, robbery was made polite, and gambling an every day duty.\r\nIdleness threw the dice, and Folly built them into castles; Avarice\r\nclutched at gold, but Fraud, with a sly and quick conveyance, snatched\r\nit from his hand. Even ladies laid wagers at home, while their lords\r\ngambled abroad; and dice began to rattle on the costermonger’s barrow\r\nas well as upon the hazard tables of the noble and the rich. Money\r\nwas looked upon as omnipotent; and the more men got the more they\r\nwanted, and especially when it was spent upon their own indulgences. An\r\navaricious, mercenary spirit became general, and chiefly for the sake\r\nof vain display and sensual pleasures.\r\n\r\nPoverty treads in the footsteps of extravagance. There were more\r\nequipages kept, and yet more taxes for the poor imposed; more\r\ndiversions, and yet more want; more ladies of taste, and yet fewer\r\nhousewives; more pomp, and yet less hospitality; more expense, and yet\r\nless frugality. In 1744, the grand jury of the county of Middlesex made\r\na presentment to the effect, that “the advertisements in the newspapers\r\nwere seducing the people to places for the encouragement of luxury,\r\nextravagance, and idleness; and that, by this means, families were\r\nruined, and the kingdom dishonoured; and that, unless some superior\r\nauthority put a stop to such riotous living, they feared it would lead\r\nto the destruction of the nation.”\r\n\r\nThe town abounded with men who regarded honour, honesty, and virtue\r\nas the merest phantoms;—men with whom promises were not binding,\r\nobligations were nullities, and impudence a duty;—dastards who might\r\nslander their neighbours, ridicule their superiors, be saucy to their\r\nequals, insolent to their inferiors, and abusive to all; to-day\r\nspaniels, to-morrow bullies, and at all times cowards; to whom learning\r\nwas a burden, and books were baubles; vice being their delight, and\r\nvirtue their aversion; demons in disguise, all order and symmetry\r\nwithout, and yet all rancour and rottenness within.\r\n\r\nThe country was an apt imitator of the vices of the town. There the\r\nsquire, having, by idleness and bad company, forgotten the little\r\nlearning he acquired at college, too often devoted himself to drinking\r\nand debauchery; while the common people were ignorant, superstitious,\r\nbrutal, and bad behaved. Workmen entered into combinations to extort\r\nhigher wages than their labour merited, or than their masters could\r\nafford; and even parliament had to pass enactments limiting the\r\nsalaries of tailors. Smuggling was enormous; and, in 1744, it was\r\ncalculated that, in the county of Suffolk only, not fewer than 4,500\r\nhorses were employed in carrying merchandise of a contraband character.\r\n\r\nThis dark picture might easily be enlarged, not from posterior\r\nwritings, or even from the religious publications of the period, but\r\nfrom periodicals, magazines, and newspapers, which had no temptation to\r\nrepresent the customs, manners, usages, and vices of the age in a worse\r\naspect than was warranted by facts. Wesley, as will be seen hereafter,\r\nused strong and startling language; but there is nothing in Wesley’s\r\nwritings which exceeds the hideous delineations found in the popular\r\nliterature published contemporaneously by other impartial and mere\r\nworldly writers, who are above suspicion. The _Weekly Miscellany_ for\r\n1732 broadly asserts that the people were engulfed in voluptuousness\r\nand business; and that a zeal for godliness looked as odd upon a man\r\nas would the antiquated dress of his great grandfather. It states that\r\nfreethinkers were formed into clubs, to propagate their tenets, and to\r\nmake the nation a race of profligates; and that atheism was scattered\r\nbroadcast throughout the kingdom. It affirms that it was publicly\r\navowed that vice was profitable to the state; that the country would\r\nbe benefited by the establishment of public stews; and that polygamy,\r\nconcubinage, and even sodomy were not sinful.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the reign of the second George bore a striking\r\nresemblance to the present day. There was unexampled wealth, followed\r\nby luxury, display, dissipation, gambling, irreligion, and wickedness.\r\nThe pastoral letters of Bishop Gibson, published at this period, show\r\nthat most pernicious efforts were put forth to undermine religion,\r\nand to make men infidels. One class of writers laboured to set aside\r\nall Christian ordinances, the Christian ministry, and a Christian\r\nchurch. Another so allegorized the meaning of the miracles of Christ,\r\nas to take away their reality. Others displayed the utmost zeal for\r\nnatural religion in opposition to revealed; and all, or most, under the\r\npretence of pleading for the liberties of men, ran into the wildest\r\nlicentiousness. Reason was recommended as a full and sufficient guide\r\nin matters of religion, and the Scriptures were to be believed only as\r\nthey agreed or disagreed with the light of nature.\r\n\r\nThe same causes give birth to the same effects. Things reproduce\r\nthemselves. The words of Solomon are as truthful now as when he wrote\r\nthem,—“The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that\r\nwhich is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing\r\nunder the sun.”\r\n\r\nBy reviving religion, Methodism saved the nation more than a hundred\r\nyears ago; and now that the nation presents the same aspect, to a\r\ngreat extent, as it presented then, and is threatened with the same\r\ndisasters, is it not certain that nothing but an agency analogous to\r\nthe Methodism then raised up will be found sufficient to check the\r\nprogress of antiquated errors now revived; to stem the aboundings of\r\nlicentiousness; and to make men feel that wealth is given, not to be\r\nspent in display and luxury, but in honouring God, and in promoting the\r\nhappiness of the human race?\r\n\r\nThe revival of religion, which occurred about the time when Methodism\r\ncommenced its marvellous career, was a world-wide one.\r\n\r\nThe Moravian movement in Germany has been already noticed.\r\n\r\nIn America, the work began in 1729, the very year in which the Oxford\r\nMethodists formed their first society. The Rev. Jonathan Edwards\r\nfanned the fire into a holy flame by preaching the grand old doctrine\r\nof “justification by faith alone.” In the town of Northampton, New\r\nEngland, containing two hundred families, there was scarcely a single\r\nperson at the beginning of the year 1735 who was not deeply convinced\r\nof sin, and earnestly seeking salvation; and from day to day, for\r\nmonths, there were undeniable instances of genuine conversion. Almost\r\nevery house was a house of prayer, and, in all companies, Christ was\r\nthe theme of public conversation. The revival which commenced at\r\nNorthampton spread throughout the greater part of the colony. All sorts\r\nof people,—high and low, rich and poor, wise and unwise, moral and\r\nimmoral,—simultaneously became the subjects of the Spirit’s strivings,\r\nand were converted. This remarkable movement took place only a few\r\nmonths before Wesley set sail for Georgia, and continued for several\r\nyears afterwards. Mr. Edwards published a narrative of its most\r\nstriking incidents; and also his “Thoughts” as to “the way in which it\r\nought to be acknowledged and promoted;” and from these two invaluable\r\ntreatises we collect the following facts.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, conviction of sin and conversion were attended with\r\nintense physical excitement. Numbers fell prostrate on the ground,\r\nand cried aloud for mercy. The bodies of others were convulsed and\r\nbenumbed. As chaos preceded creation, so in New England confusion went\r\nbefore conversion. The work was great and glorious, but was accompanied\r\nwith noise and tumult. Men literally _cried_ for mercy; but the loudest\r\noutcries were not so loud as the shrieks of Voltaire or Volney,\r\nwhen the prospect of eternity unmanned them. Stout-hearted sinners\r\ntrembled; but not more than philosophers at the present day would do,\r\nif they had equally vivid views of the torments of the damned to which\r\nsin exposes them. There were groanings and faintings; transports and\r\necstasies; zeal sometimes more fervid than discreet; and passion not\r\nunfrequently more powerful than pious; but, from one end of the land\r\nto the other, multitudes of vain thoughtless sinners were unmistakably\r\nconverted, and were made new creatures in Christ Jesus. Frolicking,\r\nnight walking, singing lewd songs, tavern haunting, profane speaking,\r\nand extravagance in dress, were generally abandoned. The talk of the\r\npeople was about the favour of God, an interest in Christ, a sanctified\r\nheart, and spiritual blessedness here and hereafter. The country was\r\nfull of meetings of persons of all sorts and ages to read, pray, and\r\nsing praises. Oftentimes the people were wrought up into the highest\r\ntransports of love, joy, and admiration, and had such views of the\r\nDivine perfections, and the excellencies of Christ, that, for five or\r\nsix hours together, their souls reposed in a kind of sacred elysium,\r\nuntil the body seemed to sink beneath the weight of Divine discoveries,\r\nand nature was deprived of all ability to stand or speak. Connected\r\nwith all this, there were no enthusiastic impulses, or supposed\r\nrevelations, but trembling reverence, the mildest meekness, and warmest\r\ncharity. To use Edwards’ own language, “The New Jerusalem, in this\r\nrespect, had begun to come down from heaven, and perhaps never were\r\nmore of the prelibations of heaven’s glory given upon earth.”\r\n\r\nOf course there were men who opposed and maligned this blessed work of\r\nGod’s Holy Spirit; or, at all events, did their utmost to discredit\r\nit by exposing, as they thought, the infirmities of those who were\r\nthe chief agents used in promoting it. Ministers were blamed for\r\ntheir earnestness in voice and gesture, and for addressing themselves\r\nrather to the passions of their hearers than their reason. Others were\r\ncensured for preaching the terrors of the law too frequently, and for\r\nfrightening the people with hell-fire discourses. Objections were\r\nraised against so much time being spent in religious meetings; though\r\nthe objectors had been significantly silent when the selfsame persons\r\nhad formerly spent quite as much time, and even more, in taverns,\r\nand in sinful pleasures. Some were disgusted at the new converts so\r\npassionately warning, inviting, and entreating others to be saved. Some\r\nfound fault with so much singing, forgetting that singing is one of the\r\ngreat employments of the beatified in heaven; and others found equal\r\nfault with children being allowed to meet together to read and pray,\r\nthus, unintentionally perhaps, resembling the priests and scribes,\r\nwho were sore displeased when the children saluted Christ by shouting\r\n“Hosannah in the highest!” Thus did men mutter discontent when they\r\nought to have sung praises; and not a few fell into the sin of those\r\nin olden times, who said concerning Christ, “He casteth out devils by\r\nBeelzebub, the prince of devils.”\r\n\r\nAt the very time that this marvellous religious revival broke out in\r\nAmerica, a similar work was begun in Wales. Howel Harris was born at\r\nTrevecca in 1714, and, a few months before the Wesleys went to Georgia,\r\nfound the forgiveness of sins, and was made unutterably happy by a\r\nDivine assurance of his adoption into the family of God. The Wesleys,\r\nhowever, had no acquaintance with him, nor he with them. While they\r\nwere on the ocean he left his home in Wales, and entered the university\r\nfrom which they had so recently departed; but here he was so distressed\r\nwith collegiate immoralities, that, after keeping but a single term,\r\nhe returned to his native hills, and, without orders, began at once\r\nto preach the salvation which he himself experienced. It is a curious\r\nfact, not generally noticed, that the first lay preacher, in the great\r\nMethodist movement, was Howel Harris. He commenced preaching in Wales\r\njust when the Wesleys and Ingham commenced in Georgia; and, before\r\nWesley reached Bristol in 1739, had been the means of a most glorious\r\nwork being wrought in the neighbouring principality. Up to this period\r\nthe morals of the Welsh were deplorably corrupt; and in this respect\r\nthere was no difference between rich and poor, ministers and people;\r\ngluttony, drunkenness, and licentiousness were general. In the pulpits\r\nof parish churches the name of Christ was hardly ever uttered; and, in\r\n1736, there were only six Dissenting chapels throughout the whole of\r\nnorthern Wales.\r\n\r\nHarris first commenced visiting from house to house in his own native\r\nparish, and in neighbouring ones. Then the people flocked together,\r\nand, almost without knowing it, he began to preach. The magistrates and\r\nclergy threatened him; but their threats failed to silence him. For\r\na maintenance, he set up a school, and meantime continued preaching.\r\nNumbers were convinced of sin, and these the young preacher, only\r\ntwenty-two years of age, formed into small societies analogous to\r\nthose of which he had read in Dr. Woodward’s History. At the end of\r\n1737, persecuting malice ejected him from his school; but, as in other\r\ninstances so in this, it overshot its mark; for this, instead of\r\nsilencing the preacher, made him preach more than ever. He now gave\r\nhimself entirely to the work of an evangelist, and henceforth generally\r\ndelivered three or four, and sometimes five or six, sermons every day\r\nto crowded congregations. A wide-spread reformation followed. Public\r\ndiversions became unfashionable, and religion became the theme of\r\ncommon conversation. A few began to help him, of whom the venerable\r\nRev. Griffith Jones was the most prominent. In 1737, this devoted\r\nclergyman instituted his movable free schools; and a letter published\r\nin the _Glasgow Weekly History_, of 1742, describes him as “one of the\r\nmost excellent preachers in Great Britain.” Not a few of the teachers\r\nin his peripatetic schools became Methodist preachers; and certainly\r\ntheir travels as instructors, as well as his own preaching tours,\r\nprepared the way for the Methodist itinerant ministry.\r\n\r\nThus was Howel Harris an itinerant preacher at least a year and a half\r\nbefore Whitefield and Wesley were; and, as the brave-hearted herald\r\nof hundreds more who were to follow after him, he met the fiercest\r\npersecutions with an undaunted soul and an unflinching face. Parsons\r\nand country squires menaced him, and mobs swore and flung stones and\r\nsticks at him; but he calmly pursued his way, labouring almost alone\r\nin his own isolated sphere until he met with Whitefield in the town of\r\nCardiff, in 1739. Whitefield says he found him “a burning and shining\r\nlight; a barrier against profanity and immorality; and an indefatigable\r\npromoter of the gospel of Christ. During the last three years, he had\r\npreached almost twice every day, for three or four hours together;\r\nand, in his evangelistic tours, had visited seven counties, and had\r\nestablished nearly thirty societies; and still his sphere of action was\r\nenlarging daily.”\r\n\r\nAlmost contemporaneous with this marvellous work across the Atlantic\r\nand in Wales, was another across the Tweed, in Scotland. The facts\r\nfollowing are taken from “A Faithful Narrative, written by James Robe,\r\nA.M., Minister of the Gospel at Kilsyth,” and printed in 1742.\r\n\r\nFor years past, there had been a sensible decay in the life and power\r\nof godliness in Scotland; but, in 1740, Mr. Robe began to preach\r\nupon the doctrine of regeneration. Meanwhile, a glorious revival of\r\nthe work of God occurred at Cambuslang; and, on April 25, 1741, at\r\nKilsyth. Sixteen children began to hold prayer-meetings in the town of\r\nKirkintilloch, and the godly excitement became general. On every hand\r\nwere heard cries, groans, and the voice of weeping. On the 16th of May,\r\nabove thirty persons were awakened under the ministry of Mr. Robe,\r\nand, in a short time after, hundreds were converted in the country\r\nround about. Drunkenness, and swearing, and other flagrant sins were\r\ninstantly abandoned; family worship was set up; meetings for prayer\r\nwere established; and the people generally flocked to the house of God.\r\nYoung converts held prayer-meetings in fields, barns, schoolhouses,\r\nand the manses of their ministers. Cambuslang, Kilsyth, Campsie,\r\nKirkintilloch, Auchinloch, St. Ninians, Gargunnock, Calder, Badernock,\r\nIrvine, Long Dreghorn, Kilmarnock, Larbert, Dundee, Bothwell, Muthill,\r\nEdinburgh, Glasgow, and other towns, villages, and parishes were\r\nvisited with a most gracious outpouring of God’s Holy Spirit; and\r\nscenes of mercy were witnessed quite as striking as those which were\r\noccurring simultaneously both in England and America. Not a few of the\r\nconverts, about one sixth of the whole, suffered such distress of mind,\r\nand were under such powerful religious influence, that they not only\r\ncried and shrieked aloud, but trembled, fainted, and were convulsed\r\nin their bodies most mysteriously—exhibiting the same physical\r\naffections as the converts in New England; and this evoked considerable\r\nopposition, and led the Associate Presbytery at Dunfermline, to\r\npronounce the movement a “delusion, and the work of the grand\r\ndeceiver.” Some were seized with such trembling that their friends\r\nhad to render them support. Many of the females went into hysterics.\r\nNumbers, on finding peace, broke forth into rapturous weeping, and\r\nhad their countenances so lit up with serenity and brightness, that\r\ntheir neighbours declared they had obtained not only new hearts, but\r\nnew faces. A few, but not many, professed to have visions of hell, of\r\nheaven, of the devil, and of Jesus.\r\n\r\nThe writer gives these facts as he finds them. Mr. Robe, in his\r\nnarrative, extending over hundreds of pages, endeavours to show that\r\nsuch effects were not without precedents, and quotes a great number\r\nof similar instances which had occurred, in different places, from\r\nthe time of the Reformation downwards. It is no part of our purpose\r\neither to explain, justify, or condemn them. We shall shortly find the\r\nsame kind of effects following the preaching of Wesley in England. At\r\npresent, the reader is merely reminded of the wondrous and glorious\r\nfact, that the great Methodist revival of religion, begun in 1739,\r\nstood not alone; for God, in His sovereign mercy, was working works\r\nquite as great in Germany, America, and Scotland. The revival in\r\nGermany gave birth to the heroic, martyr-like Moravian church. That\r\nin America greatly prepared the way for Whitefield, and for the first\r\nMethodist missionaries to that huge continent. That in Scotland\r\nrevived the almost expiring piety of the kirk across the border; and,\r\ndoubtless, greatly contributed to the devout and increasing energy and\r\nzeal evinced by the different churches there from that day to this.\r\nAnd that in Wales has issued in results equally remarkable. God the\r\nSpirit is omnipresent, and can give a universal revival of truth and\r\ngodliness as easily as a local one. It is, also, a significant fact, of\r\nvast importance, that the whole of these great revivals were begun by\r\npreaching the same kind of truth. Christian David, the carpenter, begun\r\nthe work in Moravia by preaching the doctrine of salvation by simple\r\nfaith in Christ; and so did Jonathan Edwards in America. The revival at\r\nKilsyth sprang out of Mr. Robe’s sermons on regeneration; and no one\r\nneed be told that these were the doctrines which formed the staple of\r\nWesley’s and Whitefield’s sermons in Great Britain. This is the truth\r\npre-eminently needed by man, in all ages, and in all lands; and this\r\nis the truth which, wherever preached, is always honoured, by being\r\nmade the means of man’s salvation.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year 1738, Wesley was almost uniformly excluded\r\nfrom the pulpits of the Established Church. During the whole of 1739,\r\nthe only churches in which he was allowed to preach, were Basingshaw,\r\nIslington, St. Giles’, and St. Katherine’s churches, London; and the\r\nchurches at Dummer, Clifton, Runwick, and St. Mary’s in Exeter. The\r\nfirst two months of the year were spent in the metropolis; but, with\r\nthe exception of expounding in a few private houses, Wesley had to\r\ncontent himself with preaching not more than half-a-dozen sermons. In\r\nthe month of March, he set out for Oxford, and wrote the following\r\nhitherto unpublished letter to his friend Whitefield. The letter is\r\nlong, but full of interest.\r\n\r\n    “_March 16, 1739._\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR BROTHER,—On Thursday, the 8th instant, we breakfasted\r\n    at Mr. Score’s, Oxford, who is patiently waiting for the\r\n    salvation of God. Thence we went to Mrs. Campton’s, who has\r\n    set her face as a flint. After we had spent some time in\r\n    prayer, Mr. Washington came with Mr. Gibbs, and read several\r\n    passages out of Bishop Patrick’s Parable of the Pilgrim, to\r\n    prove that we were all under a delusion, and that we were to\r\n    be justified by faith and works. Charles Metcalfe withstood\r\n    him to the face. After they were gone, we again besought our\r\n    Lord, that He would maintain His own cause. Meanwhile, Mr.\r\n    Washington and Mr. Watson were going about to all parts, and\r\n    confirming the unfaithful; and at seven, when I designed to\r\n    expound at Mrs. Campton’s, Mr. Washington was got there before\r\n    me, and was beginning to read Bishop Bull against the witness\r\n    of the Spirit. He told me he was authorized by the minister of\r\n    the parish to do this. I advised all who valued their souls\r\n    to depart; and, perceiving it to be the less evil of the two,\r\n    that they who remained might not be perverted, I entered\r\n    directly into the controversy, touching both the cause and\r\n    fruits of justification. In the midst of the dispute, James\r\n    Mears’s wife began to be in pain. I prayed with her when Mr.\r\n    Washington was gone; and then we went down to sister Thomas’s.\r\n    In the way, Mrs. Mears’s agony so increased, that she could not\r\n    avoid crying out aloud in the street. With much difficulty, we\r\n    got her to Mrs. Shrieve’s, where God heard us, and sent her\r\n    deliverance, and where her husband also was set at liberty soon\r\n    after. Presently Mrs. Shrieve fell into a strange agony both\r\n    of body and mind; her teeth gnashed together; her knees smote\r\n    each other; and her whole body trembled exceedingly. We prayed\r\n    on; and, within an hour, the storm ceased; and she now enjoys\r\n    a sweet calm, having remission of sins, and knowing that her\r\n    Redeemer liveth.\r\n\r\n    “At my return to Mrs. Fox’s, I found our dear brother Kinchin\r\n    just come from Dummer. We rejoiced, and gave thanks, and\r\n    prayed, and took sweet counsel together; the result of which\r\n    was, that instead of setting out for London, as I designed, on\r\n    Friday morning, I set out for Dummer, there being no person to\r\n    supply the church on Sunday. At Reading I found a young man,\r\n    Cennick by name, strong in the faith of our Lord Jesus. He\r\n    had begun a society there the week before; but the minister\r\n    of the parish had now well-nigh overturned it. Several of the\r\n    members of it spent the evening with us, and it pleased God to\r\n    strengthen and comfort them.\r\n\r\n    “On Saturday morning, our brother Cennick rode with me, whom\r\n    I found willing to suffer, yea, to die for his Lord. We came\r\n    to Dummer in the afternoon: Miss Molly was weak in body, but\r\n    strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. Surely\r\n    her light ought not thus to be hid under a bushel. She has\r\n    forgiveness, but not the witness of the Spirit; perhaps because\r\n    our dear brother Kinchin seems to think them inseparable.\r\n\r\n    “On Sunday morning we had a large and attentive congregation.\r\n    In the evening, the room at Basingstoke was full, and my mouth\r\n    was opened. We expected much opposition, but had none at all.\r\n\r\n    “On Monday, Mrs. Cleminger being in pain and fear, we prayed,\r\n    and her Lord gave her peace. About noon we spent an hour or two\r\n    in conference and prayer with Miss Molly; and then set out in a\r\n    glorious storm; but I had a calm within. We had appointed the\r\n    little society at Reading to meet us in the evening; but the\r\n    enemy was too vigilant. Almost as soon as we were out of the\r\n    town, the minister sent, or went, to each of the members, and\r\n    began arguing and threatening, and utterly confounded them, so\r\n    that they were all scattered abroad. Mr. Cennick’s own sister\r\n    did not dare to see us, but was gone out on purpose to avoid it.\r\n\r\n    “On Tuesday I came to Oxford again, and from Mrs. Fox’s went\r\n    to Mrs. Campton’s. I found the minister of the parish had been\r\n    there before me, to whom she had plainly declared, that she had\r\n    never had a true faith in Christ till a week ago. After some\r\n    warm and sharp expressions, he told her he must repel her from\r\n    the holy communion. Finding she was not convinced, even by that\r\n    argument, he left her calmly rejoicing in God her Saviour.\r\n\r\n    “At six in the evening, we were at Mrs. Fox’s society; about\r\n    seven at Mrs. Campton’s: the power of the Lord was present at\r\n    both, and all our hearts were knit together in love.\r\n\r\n    “The next day we had an opportunity to confirm most, if not\r\n    all, the souls which had been shaken. In the afternoon, I\r\n    preached at the Castle. We afterwards joined together in\r\n    prayer, having now Charles Graves added to us, who is rooted\r\n    and grounded in the faith. We then went to Mr. Gibbs’s room,\r\n    where were Mr. Washington and Mr. Watson. Here an hour was\r\n    spent in conference and prayer, but without any disputing. At\r\n    four in the morning I left Oxford. God hath indeed planted and\r\n    watered: O may He give the increase.\r\n\r\n    “I am, etc.,\r\n\r\n    “JOHN WESLEY.”\r\n\r\nThus did the expelled minister employ his time and energies. The\r\nchurches were shut against him; but he found work in cottages.\r\nHalf-a-dozen sermons in church pulpits in three months! No wonder that\r\nWesley escaped to Bristol. Silence to such a man was intolerable.\r\nPriests and their parasites had gagged him in the metropolis, and he\r\nnow started for a new sphere of labour.\r\n\r\nHis friend Whitefield, during the first five weeks of the year,\r\nwas more fortunate, and managed to preach about thirty sermons in\r\nconsecrated edifices in and about London. How long this permission\r\nmight have lasted, it is difficult to determine; but, at the beginning\r\nof February, Whitefield, like a flaming seraph, set off to Bath and\r\nBristol. Perhaps his departure thither was hastened by a fracas which\r\noccurred only three days before at St. Margaret’s, Westminster, where\r\nhe yielded to the pressure of the crowd, and preached, despite the\r\nopposition of the minister and his church officers.[272] Be that as it\r\nmay, the news of the disturbance, published in the _Weekly Miscellany_,\r\ngot to the west of England before him; and, on his arrival, all the\r\nchurches were closed against him. In a few days, however, Mr. Penrose\r\ngranted him the pulpit of St. Werburgh’s; and Mr. Gibbs the pulpit of\r\nSt. Mary Redcliff. The chancellor of Bristol interfered, and threatened\r\nthat, if he continued to preach or expound in the diocese without\r\nlicence, he should first be suspended and then expelled. This was\r\nthe turning point. To muzzle Whitefield was impossible; and hence,\r\nbeing shut out of the Bristol churches, away he went, on February 17,\r\nand preached, in the open air, to two hundred colliers at Kingswood.\r\nThis was the boldest step that any of the Methodists had yet taken;\r\nand perhaps none of them but the impulsive, large-hearted Whitefield\r\nwould have had sufficient courage to be the first in such a shocking\r\ndeparture from Church rules and usages. The Rubicon was passed. A\r\nclergyman had dared to be so irregular as to preach in the open air,\r\nand God had sanctioned the irregularity by making it a blessing. At the\r\nsecond Kingswood service, Whitefield says he had two thousand people to\r\nhear him; and at the third, four thousand; while, at the fifth service,\r\nthe four thousand were increased to ten. These were marvellous crowds\r\nto assemble out of doors in the bleak months of February and March. No\r\nwonder that Whitefield’s soul took fire. He declares he never preached\r\nwith greater power than now. One day, he would take his stand on Hannam\r\nMount; another, on Rose Green; and another at the Fishponds. Then he\r\nran off to Cardiff, and preached in the town hall; and then to Bath,\r\nand preached on the town common. Then we find him preaching to about\r\nfour thousand at Baptist Mills; and, on March 18, his congregation at\r\nRose Green was estimated at not less than twenty thousand, to whom he\r\npreached nearly an hour and a half.[273] A gentleman lent him a large\r\nbowling-green in the heart of Bristol, and here he preached to seven\r\nor eight thousand people. In the village of Publow, several thousands\r\nassembled to hear him; and, at Coal-pit Heath and other places, the\r\ncrowds were quite as great. All this transpired within six weeks, and,\r\nat nearly all these strange and enormous gatherings, Whitefield made a\r\ncollection for his orphan house in Georgia. His soul expanded with his\r\nmarvellous success. He wished to try the same experiment elsewhere; and\r\nhence he sent for Wesley to act as his Bristol and Kingswood successor.\r\nWesley arrived at Bristol on Saturday, March 31; and, the next day,\r\nheard Whitefield at the Bowling-green, Rose Green, and Hannam Mount,\r\nand was thus introduced to the vast congregations which Whitefield\r\nbequeathed to his godly care. He was once again ungagged, and, during\r\nthe nine months from March to December, preached and expounded almost\r\nwithout ceasing.\r\n\r\nWhitefield, on leaving Wesley at Bristol, made his way to London,\r\npreaching to assembled thousands at Gloucester and other places. The\r\nchurches in the metropolis were all closed against him; but Moorfields\r\nand Kennington Common were still open; and here, to congregations\r\nconsisting of tens of thousands, he rapturously proclaimed the glad\r\ntidings of salvation. In one instance, he computed his Kennington\r\ncongregation at fifty thousand, to whom he preached an hour and a\r\nhalf. Eighty coaches were present, besides great numbers of people on\r\nhorseback. On another occasion, his collection for the orphan house in\r\nGeorgia amounted to upwards of £47, of which £16 were in half-pence.\r\nAt another time, the concourse in Moorfields numbered nearly sixty\r\nthousand; and, at every service, he seems to have made collections for\r\nGeorgia, himself acting as one of the collectors. He then made a short\r\npreaching excursion to Hertford, Northampton, and Bedford, where the\r\nstairs of a windmill served him for a pulpit. On returning to town,\r\nhe received letters from Scotland, telling him that Ralph Erskine had\r\nturned field preacher, and had had a congregation of fourteen thousand\r\npeople. In June, Wesley came to London to see him, and preached at\r\nBlackheath to twelve or fourteen thousand people, “the Lord giving\r\nhim,” writes Whitefield, “ten thousand times more success than He has\r\ngiven me.” An embargo unexpectedly laid on shipping detained him in\r\nEngland a few weeks longer, during which he visited Hertfordshire,\r\nEssex, Gloucestershire, and other places. In July, he joined his friend\r\nWesley in Bristol, and acknowledged that the congregations were much\r\nmore serious and affected than when he had left them three months\r\nbefore. The Kingswood colliers, instead of cursing and swearing, now\r\nmade the woods ring with their hymns of praise. At length, in the month\r\nof August, Whitefield set sail for America, where we must leave him\r\nuntil his return to England, in March, 1741.\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley passed most of the year 1739 in London and its\r\nneighbourhood. His brother and his friends urged him to settle at\r\nOxford; but he refused, without further direction from God. He preached\r\nin churches as long as he was permitted; and, when prohibited, followed\r\nthe example of Whitefield and his brother.\r\n\r\nFor a moment, we must retrace our steps. As already stated, Wesley\r\nhimself spent the first two months of 1739 in London. How was he\r\noccupied? On New Year’s day, he was present at a remarkable lovefeast\r\nin Fetter Lane, which continued until three o’clock in the morning,\r\nand which consisted of himself, his brother, his clerical friends\r\nWhitefield, Ingham, Hall, Kinchin, and Hutchings, and about sixty\r\nMoravians. At the hour mentioned, the power of God came upon them\r\nso mightily, that many cried out for exceeding joy, others fell\r\nprostrate on the ground, and all joined in singing, “We praise Thee,\r\nO God; we acknowledge Thee to be the Lord.” But even this marvellous\r\nmanifestation of the majesty of God failed to remove Wesley’s doubts\r\nand fears; for, three days afterwards, we find him writing the\r\nbitterest things against himself, and concluding with the words,\r\n“Though I have constantly used all the means of grace for twenty years,\r\nI am not a Christian.”\r\n\r\nThe day after, January 5, seven of the despised Methodist clergymen\r\n(probably the seven just mentioned), held a conference at Islington,\r\non several matters of great importance, and, after prayer and fasting,\r\ndetermined what they were in doubt about, by casting lots. “We parted,”\r\nsays Whitefield, “with a full conviction that God was going to do great\r\nthings among us;”[274] a conviction which was soon verified.\r\n\r\nOn January 7, they held another lovefeast at Fetter Lane, and spent the\r\nwhole night in prayer and thanksgiving.[275]\r\n\r\nJanuary 25, Wesley baptized five adults at Islington, and makes a\r\nstrange distinction, which shows that his views of the scriptural\r\ndoctrine of salvation were still hazy and confused. He writes: “Of the\r\nadults I have known baptized lately, only one was at that time born\r\nagain, in the full sense of the word; that is, found a thorough inward\r\nchange by the love of God filling her heart. Most of them were only\r\nborn again in a lower sense; that is, received the remission of their\r\nsins.” Let the reader compare this with a passage in Wesley’s sermon on\r\n“The Great Privilege of those that are Born of God,” and he will mark\r\nthe difference.\r\n\r\n    “It has been frequently supposed, that the being born of God\r\n    was all one with the being justified; that the new birth and\r\n    justification were only different expressions, denoting the\r\n    same thing: it being certain, on the one hand, that whoever is\r\n    justified is also born of God; and on the other, that whoever\r\n    is born of God is also justified; yea, that both these gifts\r\n    of God are given to every believer in one and the same moment.\r\n    In one point of time his sins are blotted out, and he is born\r\n    again of God. But though it be allowed, that justification and\r\n    the new birth are, in point of time, inseparable from each\r\n    other, yet are they easily distinguished, as being not the\r\n    same, but things of a widely different nature. Justification\r\n    implies only a relative, the new birth a real, change. God in\r\n    justifying us does something _for_ us; in begetting us again,\r\n    He does the work _in_ us. The one restores us to the favour,\r\n    the other to the image, of God. The one is the taking away the\r\n    guilt, the other the taking away the power, of sin; so that,\r\n    although they are joined together in point of time, yet they\r\n    are of wholly distinct natures.”\r\n\r\nNothing can be more scriptural, or more clearly expressed than this;\r\nbut comparison with the extract from his journal, above given, shows\r\nthat, even in 1739, Wesley was far from being “a scribe instructed unto\r\nthe kingdom of heaven.” He still had much both to learn and to unlearn;\r\nbut it was a happy fact, that he was docile and eager to be taught.\r\nFour days after baptizing the adults at Islington, he sat up till near\r\none in the morning with Whitefield and two other clergymen, earnestly\r\nlistening to a midnight discussion concerning the doctrine of the new\r\nbirth.[276]\r\n\r\nDuring the month of February, he had three separate interviews\r\nwith bishops of the Established Church. On the 6th, he went with\r\nWhitefield to the Bishop of Gloucester, to solicit a subscription\r\nfor Georgia.[277] On the 21st, he and his brother Charles waited on\r\nPotter, Archbishop of Canterbury, who showed them great affection;\r\nspoke mildly of Whitefield; cautioned them to give no more umbrage\r\nthan necessary; to forbear exceptionable phrases; and to keep to the\r\ndoctrines of the Church. They told him they expected persecution; but\r\nwould abide by the Church till her articles and homilies were repealed.\r\nFrom Potter, they proceeded direct to Gibson, Bishop of London, who\r\ndenied that he had condemned them, or even heard much about them.\r\nWhitefield’s Journal, he said, was tainted with enthusiasm, though\r\nWhitefield himself was a pious, well meaning youth. He warned them\r\nagainst Antinomianism, and dismissed them kindly.[278]\r\n\r\nOn the day after their interview with the Bishop of Gloucester,\r\nWhitefield, shut out of the London churches, set off on his tour\r\nto Bristol. Three weeks later, Wesley wrote him an account of his\r\nproceedings in London.\r\n\r\n    “_February 26, 1739._\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR BROTHER,—Our Lord’s hand is not shortened amongst us.\r\n    Yesterday I preached at St. Katherine’s, and at Islington,\r\n    where the church was almost as hot as some of the society rooms\r\n    used to be.[279] The fields, after service, were white with\r\n    people praising God. About three hundred were present at Mr.\r\n    S——’s; thence I went to Mr. Bray’s; thence to Fetter Lane;\r\n    and, at nine, to Mr. B——’s, where also we wanted room. To-day\r\n    I expound in the Minories at four; at Mrs. W——’s at six; and\r\n    in Gravel Lane, Bishopsgate, at eight. On Wednesday, at six, we\r\n    have a noble company of women, not adorned with gold or costly\r\n    apparel, but with a meek and quiet spirit. At the Savoy, on\r\n    Thursday evening, we have usually two or three hundred, most\r\n    of them, at least, thoroughly awakened. On Friday, Mr. A——’s\r\n    parlour is more than filled; as is Mr. P——’s room twice\r\n    over.”[280]\r\n\r\nThis extract will give the reader an idea of Wesley’s weekly labours\r\nin London, up to the time that he set out for Bristol. Every day had\r\nits day’s work. It was impossible for such a man to be idle: work was\r\nessential to his happiness, and almost to his existence.\r\n\r\nAlready the people began to have faith in the power of his piety and\r\nprayers. The parents of a lunatic besought his intercessions on behalf\r\nof their afflicted son, who, for five years past, had been in the\r\nhabit of beating and tearing himself, putting his hands into the fire,\r\nand thrusting pins into his flesh. Wesley and his friends yielded to\r\nthe request on February 17; and, from that time, the poor creature,\r\nthough not fully freed from his calamitous affliction, had more rest\r\nthan he had had for two years before. On the same day, a middle aged,\r\nwell dressed woman, at a society-meeting in Beech Lane, was seized as\r\nwith the agonies of death. For three years, her friends had accounted\r\nher mad, and had bled and blistered her accordingly. Wesley prayed\r\nwith her, and, five days after, she was victoriously delivered, and\r\nin a moment was filled with love and joy.[281] Within a fortnight, a\r\nthird instance, somewhat similar, took place at Oxford, whither Wesley\r\nhad gone for a brief visit. Hearing of a woman who was most violently\r\nopposed to the Methodist revival, he went to her and argued with her.\r\nThis enraged her more and more. Wesley broke off the dispute, and began\r\nto pray. In a few minutes, the woman fell into an extreme agony, both\r\nof body and soul; and soon after cried out with the utmost earnestness,\r\n“Now I know I am forgiven for Christ’s sake;” and, from that hour, set\r\nher face as a flint to declare the faith which before she persecuted.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that, at the beginning of the month of March,\r\nWesley made a tour to Oxford, and while there wrote to Whitefield the\r\nlong letter which has been already given. On his return to London, he\r\nreceived a most urgent request from Whitefield to proceed to Bristol\r\nwithout delay. Wesley hesitated; Charles objected; and the society at\r\nFetter Lane disputed; but, at length, the matter was decided by casting\r\nlots. Wesley reached Bristol on March 31, and on April 2 Whitefield\r\nleft, summing up the results of his first six weeks of out-door\r\npreaching thus: “Many sinners have been effectually converted, and all\r\nthe children of God have been exceedingly comforted. Several thousands\r\nof little books have been dispersed among the people; about £200\r\ncollected for the orphan house; and many poor families relieved by the\r\nbounty of my friend Mr. Seward. And what gives me the greater comfort\r\nis the consideration that my dear and honoured friend Mr. Wesley is\r\nleft behind to confirm those that are awakened; so that I hope, when I\r\nreturn from Georgia, to see many bold soldiers of Jesus Christ.”[282]\r\n\r\nThe next day he wrote to Wesley the following, which is now for the\r\nfirst time given to the public:—\r\n\r\n    _“April 3, 1739._\r\n\r\n    “HONOURED SIR,—Yesterday I began to play the madman in\r\n    Gloucestershire, by preaching on a table in Thornbury Street.\r\n    To-day I have exhorted twice; and by-and-by shall begin a third\r\n    time; nothing like doing good by the way. Be pleased to go to\r\n    Kingswood, and forward the good work as much as possible. I\r\n    desire you would open any letters that come directed for me,\r\n    and send me a line to Gloucester. I wish you all the success\r\n    imaginable in your ministry; and I pray God that my Bristol\r\n    friends may grow in grace under it. Parting from them has\r\n    struck a little damp upon my joy; but God will quickly revisit,\r\n\r\n    “Honoured sir, your unworthy loving servant,\r\n    “GEORGE WHITEFIELD.\r\n\r\n    “The Rev. Mr. John Wesley, at Mr. Grevil’s,\r\n    “Wine Street, Bristol.”\r\n\r\nOn the day of Whitefield’s departure, at four in the afternoon, Wesley\r\nventured to follow his friend’s example, and for the first time in\r\nEngland dared to preach in the open air. His text was appropriate and\r\nstriking, Isaiah lxi. 1, 2. The place was “a little eminence in a\r\nground adjoining to the city.” His feeling was deep. He says: “I could\r\nscarce reconcile myself at first to this strange way of preaching in\r\nthe fields; having been all my life, till very lately, so tenacious of\r\nevery point relating to decency and order, that I should have thought\r\nthe saving of souls almost a sin if it had not been done in a church.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the prejudices and the feelings of the man who, for between\r\nfifty and sixty years proved himself the greatest out-door preacher\r\nthat ever lived.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a brief visit to London in June, September,\r\nand November, and of a short tour into Wales and another to Exeter,\r\nWesley spent the whole of his time, from April to the end of 1739, in\r\nBristol and its immediate neighbourhood. Though there are considerable\r\ngaps in Wesley’s journal, during which we lose sight of his texts\r\nand sermons, it is not too much to say that he delivered at least\r\nfive hundred discourses and expositions in the nine months of which\r\nwe speak; and it is a noticeable fact that only eight of these were\r\ndelivered in churches,—six in the church at Clifton, one at Runwick,\r\nand one at Exeter. His preaching plan was as follows:—an exposition to\r\none or other of the Bristol societies every night, and preaching every\r\nSunday morning, and every Monday and Saturday afternoon. At Kingswood,\r\nincluding Hannam Mount, Rose Green, and Two Mile Hill, he preached\r\ntwice every sabbath, and also every alternate Tuesday and Friday. At\r\nBaptist Mills, he preached every Friday; at Bath, once a fortnight, on\r\nTuesday; and at Pensford, once a fortnight, on Thursday.\r\n\r\nAnother point is worth noticing. His chief, almost his only aim, was\r\nto explain to the people the plan of scriptural salvation; for, as\r\nmay easily be seen, almost all his texts have an immediate bearing on\r\nthis the greatest of all pulpit topics. Saved himself, his whole soul\r\nwas absorbed in a grand endeavour to expound the truth which, above\r\nall other truths, is the means of saving sinners. “The points,” he\r\nwrites, “I chiefly insisted upon were four: first, that orthodoxy, or\r\nright opinions, is, at best, but a very slender part of religion, if\r\nit can be allowed to be any part at all; that neither does religion\r\nconsist in negatives, in bare harmlessness of any kind; nor merely in\r\nexternals, in doing good, or using the means of grace, in works of\r\npiety, or of charity: that it is nothing short of, or different from,\r\nthe mind that was in Christ; the image of God stamped upon the heart;\r\ninward righteousness, attended with the peace of God and joy in the\r\nHoly Ghost. Secondly, that the only way to this religion is repentance\r\ntowards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. Thirdly, that by\r\nthis faith, he that worketh not, but believeth on Him that justifieth\r\nthe ungodly, is justified freely by His grace through the redemption\r\nwhich is in Christ Jesus. And, lastly, that being justified by faith,\r\nwe taste of the heaven to which we are going; we are holy and happy;\r\nwe tread down sin and fear, and sit in heavenly places with Christ\r\nJesus.”[283]\r\n\r\nHe further tells us that the reasons which induced him to begin\r\npreaching in the open air were—1. That he was forbidden, as by a\r\ngeneral consent, though not by any judicial sentence, to preach in any\r\nchurch. 2. That the rooms in which he preached could not contain a\r\ntenth part of the people that were earnest to hear. Hence, he adds, he\r\ndetermined to do in England what he had often done in a warmer climate;\r\nnamely, when the house would not contain the congregation, to preach in\r\nthe open air; and never had he seen a more awful sight than when, on\r\nRose Green, or the top of Hannam Mount, some thousands of people were\r\ncalmly joined together in solemn waiting upon God. He had no desire or\r\ndesign to preach in the open air till he was forbidden to preach in\r\nchurches. It was no matter of choice, neither of premeditation. Field\r\npreaching was a sudden expedient, a thing submitted to rather than\r\nchosen; and submitted to, because he thought preaching even thus better\r\nthan not preaching at all; first, in regard to his own soul, because a\r\ndispensation of the gospel being committed to him, he did not dare not\r\nto preach the gospel; and secondly, in regard to the souls of others,\r\nwhom he everywhere saw seeking death in the error of their life.[284]\r\n\r\nSome of his friends urged him to settle in college, or to accept a cure\r\nof souls: to whom he replied:—\r\n\r\n    “I have no business at college, having now no office and no\r\n    pupils; and it will be time enough to consider whether I\r\n    ought to accept a cure of souls when one is offered to me. On\r\n    scriptural grounds, I do not think it hard to justify what\r\n    I am doing. God, in Scripture, commands me, according to my\r\n    power, to instruct the ignorant, reform the wicked, confirm the\r\n    virtuous. Man forbids me to do this in another’s parish; that\r\n    is, in effect, not to do it at all, seeing I have now no parish\r\n    of my own, nor probably ever shall. Whom then shall I hear? God\r\n    or man? If it be just to obey man rather than God, judge ye. I\r\n    look upon all the world as my parish; thus far I mean, that,\r\n    in whatever part of it I am, I judge it meet, right, and my\r\n    bounden duty to declare unto all that are willing to hear, the\r\n    glad tidings of salvation.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the position taken by Wesley and his friends. Their chief,\r\ntheir only business was to save souls. For this they had a world-wide\r\ncommission. Nothing short of this could satisfy the yearnings of their\r\nnature. Unlike the old Puritans and others, they had no attacks to make\r\non the despotic measures of the court and Church. “In their bosoms\r\nthere was no rankling grudge against authorities; there was no particle\r\nof that venom which, wherever it lodges, infects and paralyses the\r\nreligious affections.”[285] Their sole quarrel was, not with church or\r\nstate authorities, but with sin and Satan; and their sole object was,\r\nnot to make proselytes, but to save sinners.\r\n\r\nTheir congregations, says James Hutton, “were composed of every\r\ndescription of persons, who, without the slightest attempt at order,\r\nassembled, crying ‘Hurrah!’ with one breath, and with the next\r\nbellowing and bursting into tears on account of their sins; some\r\npoking each other’s ribs, and others shouting ‘Hallelujah.’ It was a\r\njumble of extremes of good and evil; and so distracted alike were both\r\npreachers and hearers, that it was enough to make one cry to God for\r\nHis interference. Here thieves, prostitutes, fools, people of every\r\nclass, several men of distinction, a few of the learned, merchants,\r\nand numbers of poor people who had never entered a place of worship,\r\nassembled in crowds and became godly.”[286]\r\n\r\nOf course, persecution followed. “We continued,” says Wesley, “to\r\ncall sinners to repentance in London, Bristol, Bath, and a few other\r\nplaces; but it was not without violent opposition, both from high and\r\nlow, learned and unlearned. Not only all manner of evil was spoken\r\nof us, both in private and public, but the beasts of the people were\r\nstirred up almost in all places to knock these mad dogs on the head at\r\nonce. And when complaint was made of their savage, brutal violence, no\r\nmagistrate would do us justice.”[287]\r\n\r\nThe following may be taken as specimens of the opposition met with in\r\n1739. On one occasion, Wesley had obtained permission to preach in\r\nPensford church; but, just as he was setting out, he received a letter,\r\nsaying that the minister had been informed that he was mad, and that,\r\ntherefore, the permission was withdrawn. Not being allowed to occupy\r\nthe church, Wesley took his stand in the open air; but in the midst of\r\nprayer, two men, hired for the purpose, began to sing ballads, which\r\nobliged Wesley and his friends to begin to sing a psalm, so as to drown\r\none noise by another.\r\n\r\nAnother incident must be given. Bath, at that period, was perhaps the\r\nmost fashionable city in England; and the most renowned man in Bath\r\nwas Richard, commonly called “Beau,” Nash. This accomplished rake, now\r\nsixty-five years old, was the son of a glass manufacturer in Wales, and\r\nwas expelled from Jesus College, Oxford, for his intrigues and wild\r\nadventures. At the age of thirty, he was without a fortune, and without\r\ntalents for acquiring one; and hence, to the end of life, became a\r\ngamester. The visit of Queen Anne to Bath, in 1703, had made the city\r\nthe favourite resort of people of distinction, and, ever after, the\r\namusements of the place were put under the direction of a master of\r\nthe ceremonies, this sovereignty of the city being decreed to Nash by\r\nall ranks of residents and visitors. King of Bath, he had rules posted\r\nin the pump-room, from which even royalty itself was not allowed to\r\ndeviate. He prescribed the dresses in which ladies and gentlemen were\r\nto appear at balls, and imperatively fixed the number of dances to be\r\ndanced. He himself wore a monstrously large white hat, and usually\r\ntravelled in a post chaise, drawn by six grey horses, honoured with\r\noutriders, footmen, French horns, and every other appendage of a\r\npretentious coxcomb. He lived by gambling, and scattered money with\r\nas much indifference as he won it. The city of which he was the dandy\r\nking was full of fashionable rogues. “Nothing,” says the _Weekly\r\nMiscellany_ of that period, “nothing was to be seen in it but play and\r\nthe preparations for it. Persons of all characters, distinctions, and\r\ndenominations sat down to cards from morning till night, and from night\r\ntill morning; and those who disagreed in everything else agreed in\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\nOn visiting Bath, Wesley was told that Nash meant to interfere, and was\r\nentreated not to attempt to preach. Wesley, however, was not the man\r\nto yield to a swaggering rake. He had gone to preach, and preach he\r\nwould, and did; the threatenings of Nash having made his congregation\r\nmuch larger than was expected. Besides the poor, he had many of the\r\nrich and great. Soon after Wesley began his sermon, the “Beau,” in his\r\nimmense white hat, appeared, and asked by what authority he dared to\r\ndo what he was doing now. Wesley replied, “By the authority of Jesus\r\nChrist, conveyed to me by him who is now Archbishop of Canterbury, when\r\nhe laid his hands upon me, and said, ‘Take thou authority to preach the\r\ngospel.’” “But this,” said Nash, “is a conventicle, and contrary to\r\nact of parliament.” “No,” answered Wesley, “conventicles are seditious\r\nmeetings; but here is no sedition: therefore, it is not contrary to act\r\nof parliament.” “I say it is,” cried the man of Bath; “and, besides,\r\nyour preaching frightens people out of their wits.” “Sir,” said Wesley,\r\n“did you ever hear me preach?” “No.” “How then can you judge of what\r\nyou never heard?” “I judge,” he answered, “by common report.” “Common\r\nreport,” replied Wesley, “is not enough. Give me leave to ask you, sir,\r\nis not your name Nash?” “It is,” he said. “Sir,” retorted Wesley, “I\r\ndare not judge of you by common report.” The master of ceremonies was\r\nworsted, and, after a pause, simply asked what the people wanted; upon\r\nwhich an old woman begged Wesley to allow her to answer him, and, amid\r\nher taunts, the resplendent king of the pump-room sneaked away.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the Methodists were opposed. Their preaching, their\r\ndoctrine, and their whole behaviour were novel. “Being convinced,”\r\nwrites Wesley, “of that important truth, which is the foundation of\r\nall real religion, that ‘by grace we are saved through faith,’ we\r\nimmediately began declaring it to others. Indeed, we could hardly speak\r\nof anything else, either in public or private. It shone upon our minds\r\nwith so strong a light, that it was our constant theme. It was our\r\ndaily subject, both in verse and prose; and we vehemently defended it\r\nagainst all mankind. But, in doing this, we were assaulted and abused\r\non every side. We were everywhere represented as mad dogs, and treated\r\naccordingly. We were stoned in the streets, and several times narrowly\r\nescaped with our lives. In sermons, newspapers, and pamphlets of all\r\nkinds, we were painted as unheard of monsters. But this moved us not;\r\nwe went on testifying salvation by faith both to small and great, and\r\nnot counting our lives dear unto ourselves, so we might finish our\r\ncourse with joy.”[288]\r\n\r\nWesley here mentions the attacks made upon them by the press. The\r\nfollowing are specimens:—\r\n\r\nThe _Scots Magazine_, for 1739, remarks that “Whitefield and the two\r\nWesleys offend against the rules of the Christian church, by preaching\r\nin opposition to the opinions and instructions of the bishops.” “The\r\nWesleys,” continues this Scottish censor, “are more guilty than\r\nWhitefield, because they are men of more learning, better judgment,\r\nand cooler heads. Let them go over to their proper companies, their\r\nfavourites, the Dissenters, and utter their extemporary effusions in a\r\nconventicle; but not be suffered in our churches hypocritically to use\r\nour forms, which they despise. Let them carry their spirit of delusion\r\namong their brethren, the Quakers. Let them preach up their election\r\nand reprobation doctrines among the Calvinists; and their solifidian\r\ntenets among the Antinomians. Let not such bold movers of sedition, and\r\nringleaders of the rabble, to the disgrace of their order, be regularly\r\nadmitted into those pulpits which they have taken with multitude and\r\nwith tumult, or, as ignominiously, by stealth.”\r\n\r\nThe clergy also began to bestir themselves. On Trinity Sunday, a sermon\r\non regeneration was preached in the parish churches of Greenwich,\r\nand of St. Peter the Poor, London, by the Rev. Ralph Skerret, D.D.,\r\nchaplain to the Earl of Grantham. The sermon, in 8vo, thirty-six pages,\r\nwas published; but is scarcely worth noticing. The Methodists, however,\r\nare spoken of as “restless deceivers of the people, who make it their\r\ndaily business to fill the heads of the ignorant and unwary with wild,\r\nperplexive notions.”\r\n\r\nAnother sermon, preached before the university of Oxford, on August 5,\r\nby the Rev. John Wilder, M.A., rector of St. Aldate’s, on “The Trial\r\nof the Spirits,” brands the Methodists as “deceivers,” “babblers,”\r\n“insolent pretenders,” “men of capricious humours, spiritual sleight,\r\nand canting craftiness,” “novices in divinity,” casting “indecent,\r\nfalse, and unchristian reflections on the clergy,” “newfangled\r\nteachers, setting up their own fantastic conceits, in opposition to the\r\nauthority of God, and so bigoted to their wild opinions, and so puffed\r\nup with pride and vanity at the success of their enthusiastic labours,\r\nthat they all appear fully disposed to maintain and defend their cause\r\nby more than spiritual weapons, or to die martyrs for it.”\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of October, the Rev. Charles Wheatley, M.A., vicar of\r\nFurneux Pelham, Herts, preached in St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, a\r\nsermon against the “new enthusiasts,” on “St. John’s test of knowing\r\nChrist, and being born of Him.” The sermon, with notes, was published,\r\nin 8vo, thirty-one pages, but was not calculated to augment the fame of\r\nthe honest and zealous churchman, who had already given to the public\r\ntwo important ritualistic works, entitled, “A Rational Illustration\r\nof the Book of Common Prayer,” and “An Historical Vindication of the\r\nFifty-fifth Canon.” Mr. Wheatley is less abusive than Mr. Wilder;\r\nbut yet he thinks it right to describe the Methodists as “rapturous\r\nenthusiasts, preaching up unaccountable sensations, violent emotions,\r\nand sudden changes;” and likewise “assuming to themselves, upon\r\nall occasions, the peculiar language of the Holy Ghost; equalling\r\nthemselves to prophets and apostles; boasting of immediate\r\ninspirations; and laying a blasphemous claim to greater miracles than\r\nwere ever wrought even by Christ Himself.”\r\n\r\nAnother opponent, in 1739, was Henry Stebbing, a doctor of divinity, a\r\nroyal chaplain, and preacher to the Honourable Society of Gray’s Inn.\r\nThis gentleman published “A Caution against Religious Delusion,” in\r\nthe shape of “a sermon on the New Birth: occasioned by the pretensions\r\nof the Methodists.” In this comparatively temperate production, the\r\nMethodists are charged with “vain and confident boastings, and with\r\nrash uncharitable censures;” with “gathering tumultuous assemblies to\r\nthe disturbance of the public peace, and with setting at nought all\r\nauthority and rule;” with “intruding into other men’s labours, and with\r\nencouraging abstinence, prayer, and other religious exercises, to the\r\nneglect of the duties of our station.” It is admitted that, when there\r\nare “so many combinations for vice,” “religious societies for praying,\r\nreading (if not expounding) the Scriptures, and singing psalms may be\r\nof use for the encouragement of virtue;” but the danger is lest the\r\nlaymen, who were heads or leaders of these societies, should “grow\r\nopinionated of themselves and fond of their own gifts, and should run\r\ninto wild fancies until the pale of the Church is too strait for them.”\r\nBefore the end of the year 1739, Stebbing’s sermon reached a sixth\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nAnother antagonist, more violent than Stebbing, was Joseph Trapp, D.D.,\r\nwho published, in 1739, a pamphlet of sixty-nine pages, entitled, “The\r\nNature, Folly, Sin, and Danger of being Righteous over-much; with\r\na particular view to the Doctrines and Practices of certain Modern\r\nEnthusiasts. Being the substance of four discourses lately preached in\r\nthe parish churches of Christ Church and St. Lawrence Jewry, London;\r\nand St. Martin’s in the Fields, Westminster. By Joseph Trapp, D.D.”\r\n\r\nIn this notable production, it is stated that, “for laymen to officiate\r\nin reading prayers to any assembly, except their own families,\r\nis an encroachment upon the office of those who are ordained to\r\nholy functions; and for them to expound or interpret Scripture is\r\nneither laudable nor justifiable, but tends to the confirmation,\r\nnot the removal, of ignorance.” For “a raw novice, though in holy\r\norders” (like Whitefield), “to take upon him, at his first setting\r\nout, to be a teacher, not only of all the laity, in all parts of\r\nthe kingdom, but of the teachers themselves, the learned clergy,\r\nmany of them learned before he was born, is an outrage upon common\r\ndecency and common sense; the height of presumption, confidence, and\r\nself-sufficiency; so ridiculous as to create the greatest laughter,\r\nwere it not so deplorable and detestable as to create the greatest\r\ngrief and abhorrence; especially when vast multitudes are so sottish\r\nand wicked as, in a tumultuous manner, to run madding after him.” Trapp\r\ninsinuates that the Methodists “teach such absurd doctrines, and second\r\nthem with such absurd practices, as to give countenance to the lewd\r\nand debauched, the irreligious and profane. In their own imagination,\r\ntheir errors are the height of wisdom, and their vices the most perfect\r\nvirtues. They think themselves the greatest saints, when, in truth,\r\nthey are under strong delusion, in the bond of iniquity, and in the\r\ngall of bitterness. They have set the nearest and dearest relations\r\nat variance; disturbed the quiet of families; and thrown whole\r\nneighbourhoods and parishes into confusion. They were half-dissenters\r\n_in_ the Church, and more dangerous _to_ the Church, than those who\r\nwere total dissenters _from_ it.” “Methodism was nothing but a revival\r\nof the old fanaticism of the last century; when all manner of madness\r\nwas practised, and all manner of villainy committed in the name of\r\nChrist.” Its disciples, “like Solomon’s madman, cast firebrands,\r\narrows, and death; and send to hell (only because they are not of\r\ntheir own frantic persuasion) millions of Christians much better than\r\nthemselves.”\r\n\r\nThe author proceeds:—“For a clergyman of the Church of England to pray\r\nand preach in the fields, in the country, or in the streets of the\r\ncity, is perfectly new, a fresh honour to the blessed age in which\r\nwe have the happiness to live. I am ashamed to speak upon a subject,\r\nwhich is a reproach not only to our Church and country, but to human\r\nnature itself. Can it promote the Christian religion to turn it into\r\nriot, tumult, and confusion? to make it ridiculous and contemptible,\r\nand expose it to the scorn and scoffs of infidels and atheists? To\r\nthe prevalence of immorality and profaneness, infidelity and atheism,\r\nis now added the pest of enthusiasm. Our prospect is very sad and\r\nmelancholy. Go not after these impostors and seducers; but shun them as\r\nyou would the plague.”\r\n\r\nSuch are fair specimens of the four fiery sermons preached by Dr.\r\nTrapp. Hypocrites, enthusiasts, novelists, ignes fatui, and glaring\r\nmeteors are the best names which this reverend divine could find for\r\nthe poor, peaceable, and persecuted Methodists.[289]\r\n\r\nAnother clerical adversary was “Tristam Land, M.A., late Fellow of\r\nClare Hall, in Cambridge, Curate of St. James, Garlickhith; and\r\nLecturer of the united parishes of St. Anthony and St. John Baptist.”\r\nHis sixpenny pamphlet of thirty pages was entitled, “A Letter to\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Whitefield, with a Letter addressed to the Religious\r\nSocieties.” Whitefield is attacked for teaching the doctrine, that\r\nmany are baptized without being born again; whereas Tristam Land\r\ninsists that, according to the teachings of the Church of England,\r\n“all infants, at the time they are baptized, are sanctified with the\r\nHoly Ghost; and that, though they may afterwards depart from the\r\ngrace given, and fall into sin, they are not to be commanded to be\r\nbaptized or born again a second time; for to be born more than once,\r\nin a spiritual sense, is just as impossible as to be born twice in a\r\nnatural. All that can be done in this matter is to use the several\r\nmeans of grace; or, in one word, as the Scripture expresses it, they\r\nmust be renewed again by repentance.”\r\n\r\nThis reverend gentleman then proceeds to describe the Methodists as\r\n“young quacks in divinity, running about the city, and taking great\r\npains to distract the common people, and to break the peace and unity\r\nof the Church. They are like vain persons, who think themselves\r\nhandsome, and are apt to despise others; for looking upon themselves\r\nas exquisite pictures of holiness and as patterns of piety, they\r\nrepresent us (the clergy) as dumb dogs, profane, and carnally minded.\r\nThey talk much of the pangs of the new birth, their inward feelings,\r\nexperiences, and spiritual miracles; but their faith is an ill grounded\r\nassurance, their hope an unwarrantable presumption, and their charity a\r\ncensoriousness and a contempt of their brethren of different sentiments\r\nto themselves.”\r\n\r\nGood old Dr. Byrom, in a letter dated February 8, 1739, says, “The book\r\nagainst Mr. Whitefield by Mr. Land is thought a weak piece.”[290] No\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there was published “An Expostulatory Letter to the Rev.\r\nMr. Whitefield;” also an octavo pamphlet of forty pages, entitled,\r\n“Observations and Remarks on Mr. Seagrave’s conduct and writings,\r\nin which his answer to the Rev. Dr. Trapp’s four sermons is more\r\nparticularly considered.” In this latter production, it is asserted\r\nthat Whitefield sinks the house of God into a playhouse, and turns\r\nreligion to a farce; that prostitutes swarm at his meetings, and there\r\nmake merchandise as at a country fair; that his congregations are\r\nsuch as crowd to a Smithfield show; and that Whitefield himself is an\r\nenthusiast, a blasphemer, and a wavering, wandering preacher of no\r\nestablishment, but nearly attached to the Dissenting communion, and\r\nblending his sermons with a spice both of the Papist and Mahommedan.\r\n\r\nIn a “Faithful Narrative” of Whitefield’s life and character, it is\r\nstated that numberless lies and false reports have been raised in\r\nLondon to vilify his character, and to stigmatise his followers; and\r\nhe was now branded as a mercenary knave. It was also reported that, in\r\nGeorgia, he had been imprisoned and personally chastised for making the\r\npeople mad with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAn “Expostulatory Letter” to Whitefield, “and the rest of his brethren,\r\nthe Methodists of the Church of England,” octavo, forty pages, and\r\nsigned “E. B.,” charges them with departing from the rubric in\r\n_sprinkling children_ at baptism, thus prostituting a holy ordinance,\r\nand substituting an insignificant, unavailing thing, neither worthy\r\nof God, nor beneficial to men. It also urges them to be _dipped_\r\nthemselves, and thus become exemplars to others.\r\n\r\nBesides all these, an attack was made by a young man of\r\neight-and-twenty, curate of All Saints’, Bristol, the Rev. Josiah\r\nTucker, afterwards a doctor of divinity, and Dean of Gloucester. In\r\na Letter, dated June 14, 1739, he accuses Whitefield of propagating\r\n“blasphemous and enthusiastic notions, which struck at the root of all\r\nreligion, and made it the jest of those who sat in the seat of the\r\nscornful.” Wesley replied to this, and concludes by advising Tucker\r\nnot to meddle with controversy, for his talents were not equal to its\r\nmanagement. It would only entangle and bewilder him more and more.\r\nBesides, there was no pleasure in answering a man whose head was not\r\nadapted to the right directing of disputes.[291]\r\n\r\nThe next onslaught was more authoritative and serious. On August 1,\r\n1739, Edmund Gibson, Bishop of London, published his “Pastoral Letter,”\r\nof fifty-five pages, “to the People of his Diocese; especially those\r\nof the two great cities of London and Westminster: by way of Caution\r\nagainst Lukewarmness on one hand, and Enthusiasm on the other.”\r\nTwo-thirds of this prelatical pamphlet are on enthusiasm, and are\r\nlevelled against the Methodists. Numerous extracts are given from\r\nWhitefield’s Journal, to show—1. That these enthusiasts claim to\r\nhave _extraordinary communications_ with God, and more than ordinary\r\nassurances of a special _presence_ with them. 2. That they have a\r\nspecial and immediate _mission_ from God. 3. That they think and act\r\nunder the immediate guidance of a _Divine inspiration_. 4. That they\r\nspeak of their preaching and expounding, and the effects of them, as\r\nthe sole work of a _Divine power_. 5. That they boast of sudden and\r\nsurprising effects as wrought by the _Holy Ghost_ in consequence of\r\ntheir preaching. 6. That they claim the spirit of _prophecy_. 7. That\r\nthey speak of themselves in the language, and under the character,\r\nof _apostles_ of Christ, and even of _Christ_ Himself. 8. That\r\nthey profess to plant and propagate a _new gospel_, as unknown to\r\nthe generality of ministers and people, in a Christian country. 9.\r\nThat they endeavour to justify their own _extraordinary_ methods of\r\nteaching, by casting unworthy reflections upon the parochial clergy,\r\nas deficient in the discharge of their duty, and not instructing their\r\npeople in the true doctrines of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThirteen days after the “Pastoral Letter” was published, Whitefield\r\nwrote an answer to it, and, in a firm but quiet and respectful way,\r\nreplied to all the bishop’s allegations. He concludes by charging\r\nGibson with propagating a new gospel, because he asserts, that “good\r\nworks are a _necessary condition_ of our being justified in the sight\r\nof God.” He maintains that _faith_ is the only necessary condition, and\r\nthat _good works_ are the necessary fruit and consequence. “This,” he\r\nwrites, “is the doctrine of Jesus Christ; this is the doctrine of the\r\nChurch of England; and it is, because the generality of the clergy of\r\nthe Church of England do not preach this doctrine, that I am resolved,\r\nGod being my helper, to continue instant in season and out of season,\r\nto declare it unto all men, let the consequences, as to my own private\r\nperson, be what they will.”\r\n\r\nIf the bishop really believed his accusations to be true, his pastoral\r\nis a model of meek writing. On the other hand, Whitefield’s answer is\r\none of the smartest productions of his pen; its pith and point somewhat\r\nreminding us of the terseness which characterized his friend Wesley.\r\n\r\nWhile Whitefield was skirmishing with the Bishop of London, Wesley\r\nwas having a brush with the Bishop of Bristol. First they discussed\r\nthe subject of faith as the only necessary condition of a sinner’s\r\njustification before God. Then his lordship charged the Methodists\r\nwith “a horrid thing, a very horrid thing,” namely, “pretending\r\nto extraordinary revelations and gifts of the Holy Ghost.” The\r\nconversation concluded thus:—\r\n\r\n_Bishop._ “I hear you administer the sacrament in your societies.”\r\n\r\n_Wesley._ “My lord, I never did yet; and I believe I never shall.”\r\n\r\n_Bishop._ “I hear too, that many people fall into fits in your\r\nsocieties, and that you pray over them.”\r\n\r\n_Wesley._ “I do so, my lord, when any show, by strong cries and tears,\r\nthat their soul is in deep anguish; and our prayer is often heard.”\r\n\r\n_Bishop._ “Very extraordinary indeed! Well, sir, since you ask my\r\nadvice, I will give it freely. You have no business here; you are not\r\ncommissioned to preach in this diocese. Therefore, I advise you to go\r\nhence.”\r\n\r\n_Wesley._ “My lord, my business on earth is, to do what good I can.\r\nWherever, therefore, I think I can do most good, there must I stay,\r\nso long as I think so. At present, I think I can do most good here;\r\ntherefore, here I stay. Being ordained a priest, by the commission\r\nI then received, I am a priest of the church universal; and being\r\nordained as fellow of a college, I was not limited to any particular\r\ncure, but have an indeterminate commission to preach the word of God\r\nin any part of the Church of England. I conceive not, therefore, that\r\nin preaching here by this commission I break any human law. When I am\r\nconvinced I do, then it will be time to ask, shall I obey God or man?\r\nBut if I should be convinced in the meanwhile that I could advance the\r\nglory of God and the salvation of souls, in any other place more than\r\nin Bristol, in that hour, by God’s help, I will go hence; which till\r\nthen I may not do.”[292]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, a pamphlet of ninety-six pages was published,\r\nentitled, “The Life of the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield, by an Impartial\r\nHand.” Impartiality is pretended, but hostility is seen. The object\r\nof the Life is evidently to make the subject of it a mark for the\r\nshafts of ridicule. Accounts are given of the fracas in St. Margaret’s\r\nchurch, Westminster, on Sunday, February 4. There is also “a method of\r\nconfession drawn up for the use of the women Methodists,” professedly\r\ntaken from the original in Whitefield’s or Wesley’s own handwriting,\r\nand with which, it is alleged, the Deists are delighted. Among other\r\nquestions, to be asked, as often as occasion required, were the\r\nfollowing: “Are you in love? Whom do you love just now, better than\r\nany other person in the world? Is not the person an idol? Does any\r\ncourt you? How do you like him? How do you feel yourself when he comes,\r\nwhen he stays, and when he goes away?” A full account is, likewise,\r\nfurnished of Joseph Periam, a young clerk to an attorney, who had been\r\nconverted, partly by reading Whitefield’s sermons on the new birth, and\r\nwhom his friends had put into a madhouse—(1) Because he fasted for near\r\na fortnight. (2) Because he prayed so as to be heard several storeys\r\nhigh. (3) Because he had sold his clothes and given the money to the\r\npoor. The Methodists are further charged with attempting to take away\r\nthe liberty of the press; Wesley is accused of placing his converts,\r\nwhen delivered from their violent agitations and distortions, on an\r\neminence, for others to behold them; and Whitefield is charged with\r\nsaying, that he could produce two cobblers in Bristol, that knew more\r\nof true Christianity than all the clergy in the city put together. His\r\nJournals are designated rhapsodies and repetitions of spiritual pride,\r\nvanity and nonsense; he is accused of wilful and notorious falsehood,\r\nand of taking pleasure in being abusive and scurrilous.\r\n\r\nAll this breathes fury; but the following taken from the _Weekly\r\nMiscellany_ of July 21, 1739, surpasses it. The Methodist preacher\r\nstands on an eminence with admiring and subscribing crowds about\r\nhim. He is young, which is good; looks innocent, which is better; and\r\nhas no human learning, which is best of all. He spreads his hands and\r\nopens his lips as wide as possible. He talks of a sensible new birth;\r\ngood women around him come to his assistance; he dilates himself;\r\ncries out; the hill swells into a mountain; and _parturiunt montes,\r\nnascitur ridiculus mus_. Then there is a chorus of ten thousand sighs\r\nand groans, deepened with the blowing of bassoons and horns. The\r\nMethodists are mad enthusiasts who teach, for dictates of the Holy\r\nSpirit, seditions, heresies, and contempt of the ordinances of God\r\nand man. They are buffoons in religion, and mountebanks in theology;\r\ncreatures who disclaim sense and are below argument; visionary antics\r\nin gowns and cassocks; so buffeted by the devil as to be qualified to\r\nbe confessors to the whole island; composing sermons as fast as they\r\ncan write, and speaking faster than they think; and forming societies\r\nof females, who are to confess their love affairs one to another, and\r\nto take care that there shall be a supply of new Methodists for future\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, appeared a pamphlet, of twenty-eight pages, entitled\r\n“The Methodists; an Humorous, Burlesque Poem, addressed to the Rev. Mr.\r\nWhitefield and his followers.” The frontispiece represents the great\r\npreacher addressing an immense crowd on Kennington Common, while, on\r\nthe outskirts of the congregation, are coaches of all descriptions, and\r\na gibbet on which three condemned felons are hanging. Describing the\r\nMethodists, the poem says:—\r\n\r\n    “By rule they eat, by rule they drink,\r\n    Do all things else by rule, but think—\r\n    Accuse their priests of loose behaviour,\r\n    To get more in the laymen’s favour;\r\n    Method alone must guide ‘em all,\r\n    Whence Methodists themselves they call.”\r\n\r\nAfter this, the devil is represented as making a tour from Rome to\r\nOxford, in the course of which he stole the bigoted madness of a Turk,\r\nand the wit of a modern atheist, both of which he drenched, dull and\r\ndeep, in a literary Dutchman’s brain, and then, making them his own,\r\nand pulling off his horns, and shoeing his cloven foot, dressing\r\nhimself in a student’s gown, and using for the nonce a distorted\r\nface, and, because of the piety of its nasal tones, a Noncon parson’s\r\nnose, he introduced himself to the Oxford Methodists, and gave them\r\ninstructions how to act, so as to effect their purposes,—instructions\r\ntoo lascivious to be reprinted. As a _very mild_ specimen of this\r\nfoul-mouthed poem, we give another description of the Methodists:—\r\n\r\n    “All men of thought with laughter view,\r\n    Or pity, the mistaken crew;\r\n    Who, mad with Scripture, void of sense,\r\n    And thoughtless, novelists commence;\r\n    Swerve from the rules of mother Church,\r\n    And leave her basely in the lurch:\r\n    To holy _Holt_ they all repair,\r\n    There join in _folly_ and in prayer;\r\n    Next round the _gaols_ they hovering fly,\r\n    To plague the wretches ere they die;\r\n    And while the children lisp their praise,\r\n    ‘Bless ‘em!’ each good old woman says.”\r\n\r\nAt the risk of exhausting the reader’s patience, we must notice another\r\nanti-Methodist pamphleteer, who, in 1739, did his little best to\r\nstrangle the new-born system at its birth. This was a certain “James\r\nBate, M.A., Rector of St. Paul’s, Deptford; and formerly Chaplain to\r\nHis Excellency Horatio Walpole, Esq.”\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the redoubtable author gave to the world a pamphlet\r\nof thirty-eight pages, bearing the title, “Methodism Displayed; or\r\nRemarks upon Mr. Whitefield’s Answer to the Bishop of London’s Pastoral\r\nLetter.” In this production, Whitefield is charged with causing numbers\r\nof poor tradesmen to leave their families to starve, only to ramble\r\nafter himself; in dividing the word of God, he violently divides\r\ntext from context, and makes arrant nonsense of both; he shuffles\r\nand prevaricates; treats the bishop with saucy sneers; is guilty of\r\nflat falsehoods, disingenuous quirks, and mean evasions; perfidiously\r\ntramples upon the canons of the Church; and flies in the face of his\r\ndiocesan with unparalleled pride and impudence.\r\n\r\nNot having exhausted all his wrath, the same reverend gentleman,\r\nat the end of the year, issued another manifesto, of sixty-six\r\npages, entitled, “Quakero-Methodism; or a Confutation of the First\r\nPrinciples of the Quakers and Methodists.” This was a dear shilling’s\r\nworth, written in reply to a letter on Bate’s former pamphlet “by\r\nT. S——y, Esq.” Bate asserts that the whole performance of the\r\n“Quakero-Methodist” (as T. S——y is called) may be ranked under the\r\ntwo heads of scurrility and sophistry; but as God, at whose altar he\r\nserves, has forbid him to return railing for railing, he will give\r\nno answer to the scurrility whatever. He then, notwithstanding this,\r\nproceeds to accuse his adversary of having “troubled the public with\r\na load of stupidity, folly, and nonsense.” He alleges against him\r\n“insipid sneers, like the grins of an idiot;” he tells him that “the\r\nshortest cut for him to avoid writing nonsense is to lay down his pen;”\r\nthat his “whole stock of knowledge has been laid in at some expounding\r\nhouse that was under the influence of the spirit of presumption,\r\nignorance, pride, and arrogance;” and that “his arguments have never\r\nmore than two gentle faults, false premises and a false conclusion.”\r\nHe says, Whitefield “chews” the charges of the Bishop of London, “just\r\nas an ass mumbles a thistle, without either the courage to swallow it,\r\nor the sense to lay it down;” and concludes by assuring his opponent\r\nthat he could have “goaded him with the sharpest, bitterest, and\r\nseverest sarcasms, and have scourged his spiritual pride with wholesome\r\nseverity;” but in mercy he has refrained from using such “a whip of\r\nscorpions.”\r\n\r\nThe magazines and newspapers of the period were filled with similar\r\nabuse of the poor Methodists. The writer has examined most of them,\r\nand has been struck with two facts:—(1) of those admitting letters and\r\narticles against the Methodists, the fairest and most moderate was the\r\n_Gentleman’s Magazine_; and (2) the bitterest and most violent was the\r\nprofessedly religious _Weekly Miscellany_, a weekly folio sheet of four\r\npages. The following is a mild specimen from the latter, and refers not\r\nonly to the movements of Wesley and Whitefield in the south of England,\r\nbut of Ingham in the north. After accusing Whitefield of “behaviour\r\ndisgraceful to the Christian religion and to the ministerial office,”\r\nthe journalist proceeds to say that—\r\n\r\n“The clergy had all refused him their pulpits, and the lord mayor\r\nthe halls and markets of the city.” He was “a conceited boaster and\r\nheterodox intruder; whose next performance was to be accompanied with\r\na chorus of ten thousand sighs and groans, deepened with bassoons. In\r\nthe approaching winter, the town would be entertained with harlequin\r\nturned Methodist, by way of reprisals, since the Methodist had turned\r\nharlequin. In Yorkshire, by the preaching of the Methodists, the spirit\r\nof enthusiasm had so prevailed, that almost every man who could hammer\r\nout a chapter in the Bible had turned an expounder of the Scripture,\r\nto the great decay of industry, and the almost ruin of the woollen\r\nmanufacture, which seemed threatened with destruction for want of\r\nhands to work it.” “Methodism has laid aside play-books and poems,\r\nfor Scripture phrases and hymns of its own composing. Its disciples\r\nwere never easy but when they were in a church, or expounding the\r\nBible, which they could do offhand, from Genesis to Revelation, with\r\ngreat ease and power. They had given away their finery to tattered\r\nbeggars, resolving to wear the coarsest attire and to live upon the\r\nmost ordinary diet. They hired barns, where they met at six in the\r\nevening; expounded, prayed, and sang psalms till towards ten; and then\r\nhad a lovefeast to communicate their experiences, especially as to love\r\naffairs.” “Several fine ladies, who used to wear French silks, French\r\nhoops of four yards wide, bob-wigs, and white satin smock petticoats,\r\nwere turned Methodists, and now wore stuff gowns, common night-mobs,\r\nand plain bays for _Jennys_.”\r\n\r\nNumbers of similar extracts might be given from the newspapers and\r\nperiodicals of 1739; but the reader has had enough of scurrilous and\r\nlying hodge-podge to satisfy the cravings of the greatest gossip.\r\n\r\nSuch were the premonitory mutterings of the storm in which the\r\nMethodist movement was cradled. Mobs threatened; newspapers, magazines,\r\nand other periodicals fulminated their malicious squibs; prelates,\r\npriests, and doctors of divinity became militant pamphleteers; but,\r\nin the midst of all, Wesley and his friends calmly proceeded in their\r\nglorious calling. Some even, who were animated with a friendly feeling\r\ntowards them, looked upon their course of conduct with alarm. Good Dr.\r\nDoddridge, in a letter dated May 24, 1739, writes:—\r\n\r\n    “I think the Methodists sincere; I hope some may be reformed,\r\n    instructed, and made serious by their means. I saw Mr.\r\n    Whitefield preaching on Kennington Common last week to an\r\n    attentive multitude, and heard much of him at Bath; but,\r\n    supposing him sincere and in good earnest, I still fancy that\r\n    he is but a _weak_ man—much too positive, says rash things,\r\n    and is bold and enthusiastic. I am most heartily glad to hear\r\n    that any _real_ good is done anywhere to the souls of men; but\r\n    whether these Methodists are in a right way—whether they are\r\n    warrantable in all their conduct,—whether _poor_ people should\r\n    be urged, through different persons successively, to pray from\r\n    four in the morning till eleven at night, is not clear to me;\r\n    and I am less satisfied with the high pretences they make to\r\n    the Divine influence. I think what Mr. Whitefield says and\r\n    does comes but little short of an assumption of inspiration or\r\n    infallibility.”[293]\r\n\r\nAnother friend, Mr. T. Hervey, writing in the same month to Samuel\r\nWesley, at Tiverton, says, that he is anxious “to stop the spread\r\nand prevalence of several very strange and pestilent opinions;” and\r\nexpresses the hope that this may be done effectually by the elder\r\nbrother of Wesley, whom he designates “the dear, but deluded man.” He\r\nthen proceeds to state that—\r\n\r\n    “These pestilent opinions are—1. That the method of education,\r\n    the distinction, order, degrees, and even robes and habits\r\n    of the university are all anti-Christian. 2. That nothing is\r\n    taught in it but learning which opposes the power of God. 3.\r\n    That whoso is born of God is also taught of God, not in any\r\n    limited sense, but so as to render the use of all natural means\r\n    of no effect. 4. That all human learning, however said to be\r\n    sanctified of God, entirely disqualifies a man from preaching\r\n    the true gospel of Jesus Christ. 5. That none have a right to\r\n    preach, but such as are immediately called to it by the Holy\r\n    Ghost. 6. That an established ministry is a mere invention of\r\n    man. 7. That the Church of England and all its authority are\r\n    founded on and supported by a lie; and that all who receive a\r\n    power of preaching from it are in a state of slavery.”[294]\r\n\r\nThis was a kind and well meant letter, but it was pregnant with\r\nmistakes. Still it tends to show the enormous difficulties encountered\r\nby the Methodists at the commencement of their history. Sometimes they\r\nmet a friend, though not often; and it is a pleasing duty to introduce\r\ngodly Joseph Williams, of Kidderminster, as one who sympathised with\r\ntheir indefatigable endeavours to save the souls of their fellow men.\r\nUnder the date of September 17, 1739, he writes concerning the two\r\nWesleys, Whitefield, and Ingham:—\r\n\r\n“The common people flock to hear them, and, in most places, hear them\r\ngladly. They commonly preach once or twice every day; and expound\r\nthe Scriptures in the evening to religious societies, who have their\r\nsociety rooms for that purpose.” He then proceeds to give an account\r\nof his hearing Charles Wesley preach at Bristol. Standing on a table,\r\nin a field, the preacher, with eyes and hands lifted up to heaven,\r\nprayed with uncommon fervour and fluency. “He then preached about an\r\nhour in such a manner as I scarce ever heard any man preach. Though\r\nI have heard many a finer sermon, yet I think I never heard any man\r\ndiscover such evident signs of vehement desire” [to benefit his\r\nhearers]. “With unusual fervour, he acquitted himself as an ambassador\r\nfor Christ; and although he used no notes, nor had anything in his hand\r\nbut a Bible, yet he delivered his thoughts in a rich, copious variety\r\nof expression, and with so much propriety, that I could not observe\r\nanything incoherent through the whole performance, which he concluded\r\nwith singing, prayer, and the usual benediction.\r\n\r\n“Afterward, I waited on him at Mr. Norman’s. He received me in a very\r\nfriendly manner. Before he would take any refreshment, he, with a\r\nfew friends that waited on him, sung a hymn, and then prayed for a\r\nblessing, as at set meals. After tea, we sung another hymn; and then\r\nI went with them to the religious society, and found the place so\r\nthronged, that it was with great difficulty we reached the centre of\r\nit. We found them singing a hymn; he then prayed; and proceeded to\r\nexpound the twelfth chapter of the gospel of St. John, in a sweet,\r\nsavoury, spiritual manner. This was followed by singing another hymn;\r\nand he then prayed over a great number of bills presented by the\r\nsociety, about twenty of which respected spiritual cases. Never did\r\nI hear such praying. Never did I see or hear such evident marks of\r\nfervency in the service of God. At the close of every petition, a\r\nserious Amen, like a gentle, rushing sound of waters, ran through the\r\nwhole audience. Such evident marks of a lively fervent devotion, I was\r\nnever witness to before. If there be such a thing as heavenly music\r\nupon earth, I heard it there. I do not remember my heart to have been\r\nso elevated in Divine love and praise, as it was there and then, for\r\nmany years past, if ever. Notwithstanding some errors, which, as mere\r\nmen, they may be liable to, I cannot but believe that God is with them\r\nof a truth, and hath raised them up in this day of general defection\r\nfrom gospel purity, simplicity, and zeal, for signal service and\r\nusefulness in His church.”[295]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Charles Wesley, written in the month of September, 1739,\r\nWilliams adds: “I heartily wish you God speed. I bless you in the name\r\nof the Lord. Fear not what men can do unto you. With Him your judgment\r\nis, and your reward with your God.”[296]\r\n\r\nSuch a testimony from a man so devout, enlightened, and justly famed as\r\nJoseph Williams, the Kidderminster carpet weaver, is quite as weighty\r\nas any testimony of an opposite character from either Bishop Gibson, or\r\nany priest or prelate then watching on the walls of Zion.\r\n\r\nWe must now return to Wesley at Bristol. Every night he expounded to\r\nsocieties. These were small gatherings of religious people, which\r\nhad continued meeting for godly purposes for about the last fifty\r\nyears;[297] for it is important to remember that the “Religious\r\nSocieties” formed in the days of Dr. Horneck, previous to the\r\nabdication of King James, and again revived in the reign of Queen Mary,\r\nwere not confined to London and Westminster, but existed in different\r\ntowns throughout the kingdom. We find them in Oxford, Nottingham,\r\nGloucester, Bristol, Newcastle, Dublin, Kilkenny, and other places; and\r\nall acting substantially according to the same rules and regulations.\r\nThey met to pray, sing psalms, and read the Scriptures together; and to\r\nreprove, exhort, and edify one another by religious conference. They\r\nalso carried out designs of charity, such as supporting lectures and\r\ndaily prayers in churches, releasing imprisoned debtors, and relieving\r\nthe poor and sending their children to school. In 1737, Whitefield\r\npreached “a sermon before the “Religious Societies” at one of their\r\ngeneral quarterly meetings in Bow church, London, from the text,\r\nEcclesiastes iv. 9–12, in which he strongly advocated the practice of\r\nChristians meeting together for religious fellowship. “As coals,” says\r\nhe, “if placed asunder, soon go out, but if heaped together, enliven\r\neach other, and afford a lasting heat;” so it is with Christians.\r\n\r\nSuch were the “Religious Societies” which existed for more than\r\nhalf-a-century before the formation of the “United Societies” of the\r\npeople called Methodists; and in whose rooms and meetings, in London,\r\nBristol, and elsewhere, Whitefield and the Wesley brothers, for a few\r\nyears, were accustomed to read and explain the Scriptures almost every\r\nnight. On arriving in Bristol, Wesley found such societies as these\r\nassembling in Castle Street, in Gloucester Lane, in Weavers’ Hall, in\r\nNicholas Street, in the Back Lane, and in Baldwin Street, and at once\r\nbegan expounding to them the Epistle to the Romans, and other portions\r\nof the New Testament; and it is a remarkable fact that, with one or two\r\nexceptions, all the scenes about to be mentioned took place in these\r\nsociety meetings, or in private dwellings. We furnish them as we find\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n    April 17. At Baldwin Street, we called upon God to confirm His\r\n    word. Immediately, one that stood by cried out aloud, with\r\n    the utmost vehemence, even as in the agonies of death. But we\r\n    continued in prayer, till a new song was put into her mouth,\r\n    a thanksgiving unto our God. Soon after, two other persons\r\n    were seized with strong pain, and constrained to roar for the\r\n    disquietude of their heart. But it was not long before they\r\n    likewise burst forth into praise to God their Saviour. The\r\n    last who called upon God, as out of the belly of hell, was\r\n    a stranger in Bristol; and, in a short space, he also was\r\n    overwhelmed with joy and love, knowing that God had healed his\r\n    backslidings.\r\n\r\n    April 21. At Weavers’ Hall, a young man was suddenly seized\r\n    with a violent trembling all over, and, in a few minutes, sunk\r\n    to the ground. But we ceased not calling upon God, till He\r\n    raised him up full of peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n    April 24. At Baldwin Street, a young man, after a sharp though\r\n    short agony, both of body and mind, found his soul filled with\r\n    peace, knowing in whom he had believed.\r\n\r\n    April 26. At Newgate, I was led to pray that God would bear\r\n    witness to His word. Immediately one, and another, and another\r\n    sunk to the earth; they dropped on every side as thunderstruck.\r\n    One of them cried aloud. We besought God in her behalf, and\r\n    He turned her heaviness into joy. A second being in the same\r\n    agony, we called upon God for her also; and He spoke peace unto\r\n    her soul. In the evening, one was so wounded by the sword of\r\n    the Spirit, that you would have imagined she could not live a\r\n    moment. But immediately His abundant kindness was shown, and\r\n    she loudly sang of His righteousness.\r\n\r\n    April 27. All Newgate rang with the cries of those whom the\r\n    word of God cut to the heart; two of whom were in a moment\r\n    filled with joy, to the astonishment of those that beheld them.\r\n\r\n    April 30. While I was preaching at Newgate, a woman broke out\r\n    into strong cries and tears. Great drops of sweat ran down her\r\n    face, and all her bones shook; but both her body and soul were\r\n    healed in a moment.\r\n\r\n    May 1. At Baldwin Street, my voice could scarce be heard amidst\r\n    the groanings of some, and the cries of others calling aloud\r\n    to Him that is mighty to save; and ten persons then began to\r\n    say in faith, “My Lord and my God!” A Quaker, who stood by, was\r\n    very angry, and was biting his lips, and knitting his brows,\r\n    when he dropped down as thunderstruck. The agony he was in\r\n    was even terrible to behold. We prayed for him, and he soon\r\n    lifted up his head with joy, and joined us in thanksgiving. A\r\n    bystander, John Haydon, a weaver, a man of regular life and\r\n    conversation, one that constantly attended the public prayers\r\n    and sacrament, and was zealous for the Church, and against\r\n    Dissenters, laboured to convince the people that all this was\r\n    a delusion of the devil; but next day, while reading a sermon\r\n    on “Salvation by Faith,” he suddenly changed colour, fell off\r\n    his chair, and began screaming, and beating himself against\r\n    the ground. The neighbours were alarmed, and flocked together.\r\n    When I came in, I found him on the floor, the room being full\r\n    of people, and two or three holding him as well as they could.\r\n    He immediately fixed his eyes on me, and said, “Ay, this is\r\n    he I said deceived the people. But God has overtaken me. I\r\n    said it was a delusion of the devil; but this is no delusion.”\r\n    Then he roared aloud, “O thou devil! thou cursed devil! yea,\r\n    thou legion of devils! thou canst not stay in me. Christ will\r\n    cast thee out. I know His work is begun. Tear me in pieces, if\r\n    thou wilt; but thou canst not hurt me.” He then beat himself\r\n    against the ground; his breast heaving, as if in the pangs of\r\n    death, and great drops of sweat trickling down his face. We all\r\n    betook ourselves to prayer. His pangs ceased, and both his body\r\n    and soul were set at liberty. With a clear, strong voice, he\r\n    cried, “This is the Lord’s doing; and it is marvellous in our\r\n    eyes. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from this time forth\r\n    for evermore.” I called again an hour after. We found his body\r\n    weak as that of an infant, and his voice lost; but his soul was\r\n    in peace, full of love, and rejoicing in hope of the glory of\r\n    God.[298] The women of our society met at seven, and, during\r\n    prayer, one of them fell into a violent agony; but soon after\r\n    began to cry out, with confidence, “My Lord and my God.”\r\n\r\n    May 12. In the evening, three persons, almost at once, sunk\r\n    down as dead, having all their sins set in array before them;\r\n    but, in a short time, they were raised up, and knew that the\r\n    Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world, had taken\r\n    away their sins.\r\n\r\n    May 16. While I was declaring at Baptist Mills, “He was wounded\r\n    for our transgressions,” a middle aged man began violently\r\n    beating his breast. During our prayer, God put a new song into\r\n    his mouth.\r\n\r\n    May 19. At Weavers’ Hall, a woman first, and then a boy, was\r\n    overwhelmed with sin, and sorrow, and fear. But we cried to\r\n    God, and their souls were delivered.\r\n\r\n    May 20. In the evening God spoke to three whose souls were all\r\n    storm and tempest, and immediately there was a great calm.\r\n\r\n    May 21. Although the people had seen signs and wonders, yet\r\n    many would not believe. They could not, indeed, deny the facts;\r\n    but they could explain them away. Some said, “These were\r\n    purely natural effects; the people fainted away only because\r\n    of the heat and closeness of the rooms.” Others were “sure it\r\n    was all a cheat; they might help it if they would. Else why\r\n    were these things only in their private societies?” To-day,\r\n    our Lord answered for Himself; for, while I was preaching,\r\n    He began to make bare His arm, not in a close room, neither\r\n    in private, but in the open air, and before more than two\r\n    thousand witnesses. One, and another, and another were struck\r\n    to the earth; exceedingly trembling at the presence of His\r\n    power. Others cried, with a loud and bitter cry, “What must\r\n    we do to be saved?” And, in less than an hour, seven persons,\r\n    wholly unknown to me till that time, were rejoicing, and\r\n    singing, and, with all their might, giving thanks to the God\r\n    of their salvation. In the evening, at Nicholas Street, I was\r\n    interrupted, almost as soon as I had begun to speak, by the\r\n    cries of one who strongly groaned for pardon and peace. Others\r\n    dropped down as dead. Thomas Maxfield began to roar out, and\r\n    beat himself against the ground, so that six men could scarcely\r\n    hold him. Except John Haydon, I never saw one so torn of the\r\n    evil one. Many others began to cry out to the Saviour of all,\r\n    insomuch that all the house, and, indeed, all the street for\r\n    some space, was in an uproar. But we continued in prayer, and\r\n    the greater part found rest to their souls. I think twenty-nine\r\n    in all had their heaviness turned into joy this day.\r\n\r\n    June 15. At Wapping (London), many of those that heard began to\r\n    call upon God with strong cries and tears. Some sunk down, and\r\n    there remained no strength in them; others exceedingly trembled\r\n    and quaked; some were torn with a kind of convulsive motion in\r\n    every part of their bodies; and that so violently, that often\r\n    four or five persons could not hold one of them. I have seen\r\n    many hysterical and many epileptic fits; but none of them were\r\n    like these, in many respects. One woman was greatly offended,\r\n    being sure they might help it if they would; but she also\r\n    dropped down in as violent an agony as the rest. Twenty-six of\r\n    those who had been thus affected were filled with peace and joy.\r\n\r\n    June 16. At Fetter Lane, some fell prostrate on the ground;\r\n    others burst out into loud praise and thanksgiving; and many\r\n    openly testified, there had been no such day as this since\r\n    January the first preceding.\r\n\r\n    June 22. In the society (Bristol) one before me dropped down\r\n    as dead, and presently a second, and a third. Five others sunk\r\n    down in half an hour, most of whom were in violent agonies.\r\n    In their trouble, we called upon the Lord, and He gave us an\r\n    answer of peace. All, except one, went away rejoicing and\r\n    praising God.\r\n\r\n    June 23. This evening another was seized with strong pangs; but\r\n    in a short time her soul was delivered.\r\n\r\n    June 24. In the evening, a girl and four or five other persons\r\n    were deeply convinced of sin; and, with sighs and groans,\r\n    called upon God for deliverance.\r\n\r\n    June 25. About ten in the morning J——e C——r, as she was\r\n    sitting at her work, was suddenly seized with grievous terrors\r\n    of mind, attended with strong trembling; but, at the society\r\n    in the evening, God turned her heaviness into joy. Five or six\r\n    others were also cut to the heart this day; and, soon after,\r\n    found Him whose hands made whole.\r\n\r\n    June 26. Three persons terribly felt the wrath of God abiding\r\n    on them at the society this evening. But, upon prayer being\r\n    made on their behalf, He was pleased soon to lift up the light\r\n    of His countenance upon them.\r\n\r\n    June 30. At Weavers’ Hall, seven or eight persons were\r\n    constrained to roar aloud; but they were all relieved upon\r\n    prayer, and sang praises unto our God, and unto the Lamb that\r\n    liveth for ever and ever.\r\n\r\n    July 1. A young woman sunk down at Rose Green in a violent\r\n    agony both of body and mind: as did five or six persons, in\r\n    the evening, at the new room, at whose cries many were greatly\r\n    offended. The same offence was given in the morning by one at\r\n    Weavers’ Hall; and by eight or nine others at Gloucester Lane\r\n    in the evening.\r\n\r\nHere we pause. On June 25, Whitefield wrote to Wesley as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “HONOURED SIR,—I cannot think it right in you to give so\r\n    much encouragement to those convulsions which people have\r\n    been thrown into, under your ministry. Was I to do so, how\r\n    many would cry out every night? I think it is tempting God\r\n    to require such signs. That there is something of God in it,\r\n    I doubt not. But the devil, I believe, interposes. I think\r\n    it will encourage the French Prophets, take people from the\r\n    written word, and make them depend on visions, convulsions,\r\n    etc., more than on the promises and precepts of the\r\n    gospel.”[299]\r\n\r\nTwelve days after, Whitefield was in Bristol, and Wesley wrote as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n    “July 7. I had an opportunity to talk with Mr. Whitefield of\r\n    those outward signs which had so often accompanied the work\r\n    of God. I found his objections were chiefly grounded on\r\n    gross misrepresentations of matters of fact. But next day he\r\n    had an opportunity of informing himself better; for, in the\r\n    application of his sermon, four persons sunk down close to him,\r\n    almost in the same moment. One of them lay without either sense\r\n    or motion. A second trembled exceedingly. The third had strong\r\n    convulsions all over his body, but made no noise, unless by\r\n    groans. The fourth, equally convulsed, called upon God, with\r\n    strong cries and tears. From this time, I trust, we shall all\r\n    suffer God to carry on His own work in the way that pleaseth\r\n    Him.”\r\n\r\nThis was an important crisis. Without expressing any opinion respecting\r\nthese “signs,” as Wesley calls them, we cannot but admire Wesley’s\r\nwish and hope that God may be allowed to work His own work in His own\r\nway. Of all men living, Wesley was one of the least likely to desire\r\nnovelties like these; but he was wise enough, and reverent enough,\r\nnot to interpose when God was working, and to say, that, unless the\r\nwork was done after a certain fashion, he should object to its being\r\ndone at all. Some, in modern times, have been in danger of doing this.\r\nSinners have been undeniably converted; but because they have not been\r\nconverted at the times, or in the places, or by the instrumentalities\r\nwhich men have chosen to commend, they have objected to such\r\nconversions, and tacitly desired not to have them multiplied. This was\r\nnot Wesley’s way. He was one of the greatest sticklers for church order\r\nand religious decorum; but he was not the man to protest, that, unless\r\nGod’s work was carried on in accordance with his own predilections, he\r\nshould object to it altogether. His words are golden ones, and worth\r\nremembering by all his followers:—“_From this time, I trust, we shall\r\nall suffer God to carry on His own work in the way that pleaseth Him._”\r\n\r\nWhitefield’s objections were silenced. He came, he saw, and he was\r\nconquered. He writes, under date of July 7:—\r\n\r\n    “I had a useful conference about many things with my honoured\r\n    friend Mr. John Wesley. I found that Bristol had great reason\r\n    to bless God for his ministry. The congregations I observed\r\n    to be much more serious and affected than when I left them;\r\n    and their loud and repeated Amens, which they put up to every\r\n    petition, as well as the exemplariness of their conversation\r\n    in common life, plainly show that they have not received the\r\n    grace of God in vain. Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face\r\n    of the sky; but how is it that ye cannot discern the signs of\r\n    these times? That good, great good, is done is evident. What\r\n    is it but little less than blasphemy against the Holy Ghost\r\n    to impute this great work to delusion, and to the power of the\r\n    devil?”[300]\r\n\r\nWe resume Wesley’s notices of what he designates the “signs” of the\r\nwork of God.\r\n\r\n    July 23. On several evenings this week many were deeply\r\n    convinced; but none were delivered from that painful\r\n    conviction. I fear we have grieved the Spirit of the jealous\r\n    God, by questioning His work; and that, therefore, He is\r\n    withdrawn from us for a season. But He will return and\r\n    abundantly pardon.\r\n\r\n    July 30. Two more were in strong pain, both their souls and\r\n    bodies being well-nigh torn asunder. But, though we cried unto\r\n    God, there was no answer. One of them cried aloud, though not\r\n    articulately, for twelve or fourteen hours; when her soul was\r\n    set at liberty. She was a servant, and her master forbid her\r\n    returning to his service, saying, he would have none in his\r\n    house who had received the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\n    August 5. Six persons at the new room were deeply convinced of\r\n    sin; three of whom were a little comforted by prayer.\r\n\r\n    August 11. In the evening two were seized with strong pangs, as\r\n    were four the next evening, and the same number at Gloucester\r\n    Lane on Monday; one of whom was greatly comforted.\r\n\r\n    August 14. Three at the new room this evening were cut to the\r\n    heart; but their wound was not as yet healed.\r\n\r\nA fortnight after this, Charles Wesley came to Bristol, and John\r\nremoved to London. The work still progressed at Bristol. In one\r\ninstance, a woman screamed for mercy, so as to drown Charles’s voice.\r\nOn another occasion, he “heard on all sides the sighing of them that\r\nwere in captivity.” “The Lord added to the church daily.”\r\n\r\nIn London, numbers had been converted under the ministry of Charles\r\nWesley, Whitefield, and others; but there is no evidence to show that\r\nthere had been any “convulsions” like those at Bristol. It is also a\r\ncurious fact, that, though Wesley’s preaching on Kennington Common, in\r\nMoorfields, and in other places in the metropolis, was crowned with\r\ngreat success, there were hardly any instances of paralysing paroxysms\r\nanalogous to those already mentioned. When he returned to Bristol, in\r\nOctober, we find a renewal of such cases.\r\n\r\n    October 11. A woman showed the agony of her soul by crying\r\n    aloud to God for help. She continued in great torment all\r\n    night; but, while we were praying for her in the morning, God\r\n    delivered her out of her distress.\r\n\r\n    October 12. I was under some concern, with regard to one or two\r\n    persons, who were tormented in an unaccountable manner; and\r\n    seemed to be indeed lunatic, as well as sore vexed.\r\n\r\n    October 23. I was pressed to visit a young woman at Kingswood.\r\n    I found her on the bed, two or three persons holding her.\r\n    Anguish, horror, and despair, above all description, appeared\r\n    in her pale face. The thousand distortions of her whole body\r\n    showed how the dogs of hell were gnawing at her heart. The\r\n    shrieks intermixed were scarce to be endured. She screamed\r\n    out, “I am damned, damned; lost for ever! Six days ago you\r\n    might have helped me. But it is past. I am the devil’s now,\r\n    I have given myself to him: his I am, him I must serve, with\r\n    him I must go to hell; I will be his, I will serve him, I will\r\n    go with him to hell; I cannot be saved, I will not be saved.\r\n    I must, I will, I will be damned!” She then begun praying to\r\n    the devil. We began,—“Arm of the Lord, awake, awake!” She\r\n    immediately sank down as asleep; but, as soon as we left off,\r\n    broke out again, with inexpressible vehemence: “Stony hearts,\r\n    break! I am a warning to you. Break, break, poor stony hearts!\r\n    I am damned, that you may be saved. You need not be damned,\r\n    though I must.” She then fixed her eyes on the corner of the\r\n    ceiling, and said, “There he is. Come, good devil, come. You\r\n    said you would dash my brains out: come, do it quickly. I am\r\n    yours, I will be yours.” We interrupted her by calling again\r\n    upon God; on which she sunk down as before: and another young\r\n    woman began to roar out as loud as she had done. My brother now\r\n    came in, it being about nine o’clock. We continued in prayer\r\n    till past eleven; when God, in a moment, spoke peace into the\r\n    soul, first of the first tormented, and then of the other. And\r\n    they both joined in singing praise to Him who had “stilled the\r\n    enemy and the avenger.”\r\n\r\n    October 25. I was sent for to one in Bristol, who was taken ill\r\n    the evening before. She lay on the ground furiously gnashing\r\n    her teeth, and after awhile roared aloud. It was not easy for\r\n    three or four persons to hold her, especially when the name\r\n    of Jesus was named. We prayed; the violence of her symptoms\r\n    ceased, though without a complete deliverance. In the evening,\r\n    I was sent for to her again. She began screaming before I\r\n    came into the room; then broke out into a horrid laughter,\r\n    mixed with blasphemy. One, who apprehended a preternatural\r\n    agent to be concerned in this, asking, “How didst thou dare\r\n    to enter into a Christian?” was answered, “She is not a\r\n    Christian—she is mine.” This was followed by fresh trembling,\r\n    cursing, and blaspheming. My brother coming in, she cried out,\r\n    “Preacher! Field preacher! I don’t love field preaching.” This\r\n    was repeated two hours together, with spitting, and all the\r\n    expressions of strong aversion. We left her at twelve, and\r\n    called again at noon next day. And now it was, that God showed\r\n    He heareth prayer. All her pangs ceased in a moment: she was\r\n    filled with peace, and knew that the son of wickedness was\r\n    departed from her.\r\n\r\n    October 27. I was sent for to Kingswood again, to one of those\r\n    who had been so ill before. A violent rain began just as I set\r\n    out. Just at that time, the woman (then three miles off) cried\r\n    out, “Yonder comes Wesley, galloping as fast as he can.” When\r\n    I was come, she burst into a horrid laughter, and said, “No\r\n    power, no power; no faith, no faith. She is mine; her soul is\r\n    mine. I have her, and will not let her go.” We begged of God\r\n    to increase our faith. Meanwhile, her pangs increased more\r\n    and more; so that one would have imagined, by the violence of\r\n    the throes, her body must have been shattered to pieces. One,\r\n    who was clearly convinced this was no natural disorder, said,\r\n    “I think Satan is let loose. I fear he will not stop here,”\r\n    and added, “I command thee in the name of the Lord Jesus, to\r\n    tell if thou hast commission to torment any other soul.” It\r\n    was immediately answered, “I have. L——y C——r and S——h J——s.”\r\n    We betook ourselves to prayer again; and ceased not, till she\r\n    began, with a clear voice, and composed, cheerful look, to\r\n    sing, “Praise God, from whom all blessings flow.”\r\n\r\nThe reader must be told that L——y C——r and S——h J——s lived at some\r\ndistance, and, at the time, were in perfect health. The day after, they\r\nwere affected in the same way as the poor creature just delivered.\r\nWesley writes:—\r\n\r\n    October 28. I called at Mrs. J——s’, in Kingswood. L——y C——r\r\n    and S——h J——s were there. It was scarce a quarter of an hour\r\n    before the former fell into a strange agony; and, presently\r\n    after, the latter. The violent convulsions all over their\r\n    bodies were such as words cannot describe. Their cries and\r\n    groans were too horrid to be borne; till one of them, in a tone\r\n    not to be expressed, said, “Where is your faith now? Come, go\r\n    to prayers. I will pray with you.” We took the advice, and\r\n    poured out our souls before God, till L——y C——r’s agonies so\r\n    increased, that it seemed she was in the pangs of death. But,\r\n    in a moment, God spoke; and both her body and soul were healed.\r\n    We continued in prayer till past midnight, when S——h J——s’\r\n    voice was also changed, and she began to call upon God. This\r\n    she did for the greatest part of the night. In the morning, we\r\n    renewed our prayers, while she was crying continually, “I burn!\r\n    I burn! O what shall I do? I have a fire within me. I cannot\r\n    bear it. Lord Jesus! help! Amen, Lord Jesus!”\r\n\r\nA few other cases occurred in 1739; and, notably, one on November\r\n30, when seven persons were grievously tormented, and Wesley and his\r\nfriends continued in prayer from the time of evening service till nine\r\no’clock next morning, that is, for about fifteen hours, a case almost\r\nunparalelled in the history of the church of Christ.\r\n\r\nThese are strange and mysterious facts; and, what adds to the\r\nstrangeness, is that, excepting the cases in London, on June 15,\r\n16, and September 17, 18, all of them occurred in Bristol and its\r\nimmediate neighbourhood. During the space of time which these extracts\r\ncover, Wesley preached at Bath, Kennington Common, Moorfields,\r\nBlackheath, Gloucester, Bradford, Wells, Oxford, and in several towns\r\nin Wales, and other places; but scenes like those above described were\r\nnever witnessed except in Bristol. It is also a curious circumstance,\r\nthat, though the preaching of Charles Wesley and of Whitefield was\r\nquite as faithful as the preaching of Wesley himself, and was far more\r\nimpassioned, yet no such “signs” seem to have been attendant on their\r\nministry as were attendant on his. Similar effects sometimes followed\r\nthe preaching of Cennick, during Wesley’s absence in London, but these\r\noccurred also either at Kingswood or in Bristol. Writing to Wesley\r\nunder date of September 12, 1739, he says:—\r\n\r\n    “On Monday night, I was preaching at the school on the\r\n    forgiveness of sins, when numbers cried out with a loud and\r\n    bitter cry. Indeed, it seemed that the devil and the powers of\r\n    darkness were come among us. My mouth was stopped. The cries\r\n    were terrifying. It was pitch dark; it rained much; and the\r\n    wind blew vehemently. Large flashes of lightning and loud claps\r\n    of thunder mingled with the screams and exclamations of the\r\n    people. The hurry and confusion cannot be expressed. The whole\r\n    place seemed to resemble the habitation of apostate spirits;\r\n    many raving up and down, and crying, ‘The devil will have me; I\r\n    am his servant! I am damned! My sins can never be pardoned! I\r\n    am gone, gone for ever!’ A young man was in such horrors, that\r\n    seven or eight persons could scarce hold him. He roared like a\r\n    dragon: ‘Ten thousand devils, millions, millions of devils are\r\n    about me!’ This continued three hours, and what a power reigned\r\n    amongst us! Some cried out with a hollow voice, ‘Mr. Cennick!\r\n    Bring Mr. Cennick!’ I came to all that desired me. They then\r\n    spurned me with all their strength, grinding their teeth, and\r\n    expressing all the fury that heart can conceive. Their eyes\r\n    were staring and their faces swollen, and several have since\r\n    told me, that when I drew near, they felt fresh rage, and\r\n    longed to tear me in pieces. I never saw the like, nor even the\r\n    shadow of it before. Yet I was not in the least afraid, as I\r\n    knew God was on our side.”[301]\r\n\r\nSuch are the facts; nothing has been distorted, and nothing kept back.\r\nThey were occasionally repeated after the year 1739, but not often. A\r\nfew cases subsequently occurred in Bristol, and also in London, and in\r\nNewcastle; but nearly all related in Wesley’s Journals are contained in\r\nthe extracts already given.\r\n\r\nWhat shall be said concerning them? For a hundred and thirty years,\r\nthey have been sneered at by Wesley’s enemies, and have also puzzled\r\nWesley’s friends. No such results attended Whitefield’s ministry, and\r\nWhitefield himself regarded them with suspicion and dislike. Charles\r\nWesley, at Newcastle, in 1743, did his utmost to discourage them. He\r\nwrites:—\r\n\r\n    “Many, no doubt, were, at our first preaching, struck down,\r\n    both soul and body, into the depth of distress. Their _outward\r\n    affections_ were easy to be imitated. Many counterfeits I\r\n    have already detected. The first night I preached here, half\r\n    my words were lost through their outcries. Last night, before\r\n    I began, I gave public notice that whosoever cried, so as to\r\n    drown my voice, should be carried to the farthest corner of\r\n    the room. But my porters had no employment the whole night;\r\n    yet the Lord was with us, mightily convincing of sin and of\r\n    righteousness. I am more and more convinced, the fits were a\r\n    device of Satan to stop the course of the gospel.”[302]\r\n\r\nSamuel Wesley was in great doubt respecting them, and, in a letter\r\ndated September 3, 1739, asks:—“Did these agitations ever begin during\r\nthe use of any collects of the Church? or during the preaching of any\r\nsermon that had before been preached within consecrated walls without\r\neffect? or during the inculcating any other doctrine besides that of\r\nyour new birth?”[303]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Ralph Erskine wrote to Wesley thus: “Some of the instances\r\nyou give seem to be exemplified, in the outward manner, by the cases\r\nof Paul and the gaoler, as also Peter’s hearers (Acts ii.). The last\r\ninstance you give of some struggling as in the agonies of death, is to\r\nme somewhat more inexplicable, if it do not resemble the child of whom\r\nit is said, that ‘when he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down\r\nand tore him.’ I make no question, Satan, so far as he gets power, may\r\nexert himself on such occasions, partly to mar and hinder the beginning\r\nof the good work, in the persons that are touched with the sharp arrows\r\nof conviction; and partly also to prevent the success of the gospel\r\non others. However, the merciful issue of these conflicts, in the\r\nconversion of the persons thus affected, is the main thing.”\r\n\r\nErskine proceeds to state, that they have something, in Scotland,\r\nanalogous to what had occurred in Bristol. Sometimes a whole\r\ncongregation, in a flood of tears, would cry out at once, so as to\r\ndrown the voice of the minister.[304]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. William Hales, D.D., in his “Methodism Inspected,” accounts\r\nfor these paroxysms on “natural grounds; the sympathetic nature of\r\nall violent emotions being well known to those who have studied the\r\nphysical and moral constitution of man.”\r\n\r\nSouthey writes:—\r\n\r\n    “A powerful doctrine, preached with passionate sincerity,\r\n    produced a powerful effect upon weak minds, ardent feelings,\r\n    and disordered fancies. There are passions which are as\r\n    infectious as the plague, and fear itself is not more so than\r\n    fanaticism. When once these bodily affections were declared to\r\n    be the throes of the new birth, a free licence was proclaimed\r\n    for every kind of extravagance; and when the preacher\r\n    encouraged them to throw off all restraint, and abandon\r\n    themselves before the congregation to these mixed sensations of\r\n    mind and body, the consequences were what might be anticipated.”\r\n\r\nSouthey forgets that “powerful doctrine” was preached, with as\r\nmuch “passionate sincerity,” by Whitefield and by Charles Wesley,\r\nas by Wesley himself; but without the same effects. Besides, it is\r\nuntrue that Wesley ever “encouraged” the affected people “to abandon\r\nthemselves to these mixed sensations of mind and body.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. R. Watson writes:—\r\n\r\n    “That cases of real enthusiasm occurred at this and subsequent\r\n    periods, is indeed allowed. There are always nervous, dreamy,\r\n    and excitable people to be found; and the emotion produced\r\n    among these would often be communicated by natural sympathy.\r\n    No one could be blamed for this, unless he had encouraged the\r\n    excitement for its own sake, or taught the people to regard\r\n    it as a sign of grace, which most assuredly Mr. Wesley never\r\n    did. Nor is it correct to represent these effects, genuine\r\n    and fictitious together, as peculiar to Methodism. Great and\r\n    rapid results were produced in the first ages of Christianity,\r\n    but not without ‘outcries,’ and strong corporeal as well as\r\n    mental emotions. Like effects often accompanied the preaching\r\n    of eminent men at the Reformation; and many of the Puritan\r\n    and Nonconformist ministers had similar successes in our own\r\n    country. In Scotland, and also among the grave Presbyterians of\r\n    New England, previous to the rise of Methodism, the ministry of\r\n    faithful men had been attended by very similar circumstances;\r\n    and, on a smaller scale, the same results have followed\r\n    the ministry of modern missionaries of different religious\r\n    societies in various parts of the world. It may be laid down as\r\n    a principle established by fact, that whenever a zealous and\r\n    faithful ministry is raised up, after a long, spiritual dearth,\r\n    the early effects of that ministry are not only powerful, but\r\n    often attended with extraordinary circumstances; nor are such\r\n    extraordinary circumstances necessarily extravagancies because\r\n    they are not common. It is neither irrational nor unscriptural\r\n    to suppose, that times of great national darkness and depravity\r\n    should require a strong remedy; and that the attention of the\r\n    people should be roused by circumstances which could not fail\r\n    to be noticed by the most unthinking. We do not attach primary\r\n    importance to secondary circumstances; but they are not to be\r\n    wholly disregarded. The Lord was not in the wind, nor in the\r\n    earthquake, nor in the fire, but in the still small voice; yet\r\n    that still small voice might not have been heard, except by\r\n    minds roused from their inattention by the shaking of the earth\r\n    and the sounding of the storm.”\r\n\r\nIsaac Taylor writes:—\r\n\r\n    “These disorders resembled, in some of their features, the\r\n    demoniacal possessions mentioned in the gospel history. The\r\n    bodily agitations were perhaps as extreme in the one class\r\n    of instances as in the other; nevertheless, there is no real\r\n    analogy between the two. The demoniacs were _found_ in this\r\n    state by Christ where He went preaching; they did not _become\r\n    such_ while listening to Him. Besides, in no one instance\r\n    recorded in the Gospels or Acts, did demoniacal possession, or\r\n    any bodily agitations resembling it, come on as the initial\r\n    stage of conversion. How then are we to dispose of such cases?\r\n    Perhaps not at all to our satisfaction, except so far as this,\r\n    that they serve to render so much the more unambiguous the\r\n    distinction between themselves and those genuine affections\r\n    which the apostolic writers describe and exemplify.”\r\n\r\nWhat says Wesley himself? With due deference to the great names\r\nquoted, we respect his testimony more than theirs: first, because he\r\nwas, in sobriety of feeling, in depth of learning, and in clearness\r\nof judgment, at least their equal; and secondly, because his opinion\r\nwas pronounced after being an eye-witness, whilst theirs is founded\r\nentirely upon the representations of others, and their own ideas of how\r\nthings ought to be.\r\n\r\n1. The cases were real, not pretended, and often ended in genuine\r\nconversion. “You deny,” writes Wesley at the time, “You deny that\r\nGod does now work these effects; at least, that He works them in\r\nthis manner. I affirm both; because I have heard these things with\r\nmy own ears, and have seen them with my own eyes. I have seen very\r\nmany persons changed, in a moment, from the spirit of fear, horror,\r\ndespair, to the spirit of love, joy, and peace; and from sinful desire,\r\ntill then reigning over them, to the pure desire of doing the will of\r\nGod. I know several persons, in whom this great change was wrought in\r\na dream, or during a strong representation to the eye of their mind,\r\nof Christ either on the cross, or in glory. This is the fact; let any\r\njudge of it as they please.”[305]\r\n\r\n2. Why were these things permitted? Wesley says: “Perhaps it might be\r\nbecause of the hardness of our hearts, unready to receive anything\r\nunless we see it with our eyes and hear it with our ears, that God, in\r\ntender condescension to our weakness, suffered so many outward signs of\r\nthe very time when He wrought this inward change to be continually seen\r\nand heard among us. But although they saw ‘signs and wonders’ (for so I\r\nmust term them), yet many would not believe. They could not indeed deny\r\nthe facts; but they could explain them away.”[306]\r\n\r\n3. How were these extraordinary circumstances brought about? Wesley\r\nagain shall answer. Five years after—when he had heard all that\r\nhis enemies had to say—when such convulsive agitations no longer\r\nhappened—and when he had had sufficient time to test the genuineness\r\nof these remarkable Bristol and Kingswood conversions, and to form a\r\ncalm judgment upon the whole, he wrote as follows:—“The _extraordinary_\r\ncircumstances that attended the conviction or repentance of the\r\npeople may be easily accounted for, either on principles of reason\r\nor Scripture. First, on principles of reason. For how easy is it\r\nto suppose, that a strong, lively, and sudden apprehension of the\r\nheinousness of sin, the wrath of God and the bitter pains of eternal\r\ndeath, should affect the body as well as the soul, during the present\r\nlaws of vital union;—should interrupt or disturb the ordinary\r\ncirculations, and put nature out of its course? Yea, we may question,\r\nwhether, while this union subsists, it be possible for the mind to\r\nbe affected, in so violent a degree, without some or other of those\r\nbodily symptoms following. Secondly, it is likewise easy to account\r\nfor these things on principles of Scripture. For when we take a view\r\nof them in this light, we are to add to the consideration of natural\r\ncauses the agency of those spirits who still excel in strength, and,\r\nas far as they have leave from God, will not fail to torment whom they\r\ncannot destroy; _to tear_ those that _are coming_ to Christ. It is also\r\nremarkable that there is plain Scripture precedent of every symptom\r\nwhich has lately appeared.”[307]\r\n\r\nWe have nothing more to add. Perhaps the reader will think that more\r\nhas been said than the thing deserved. We demur to that opinion. The\r\nphenomena recorded are among the most remarkable in church history;\r\nthey are curious and mysterious; they have given rise to endless\r\ncritiques, both friendly and otherwise, and, for such reasons, merit\r\nthe space we have devoted to them. Dr. Hales’ doctrine of “the\r\nsympathetic nature of all violent emotions,” though true, is not\r\nsufficient to account for many of the instances related. Southey’s\r\nopinion is flippant, and is based upon false assumptions. Watson’s is\r\nof great importance, and, as contained at greater length in his Life of\r\nWesley, is the most elaborate discussion of the subject that has yet\r\nbeen written. Isaac Taylor’s, to some extent, coincides with Wesley’s;\r\nwhich, upon the whole, is the clearest, fullest, and the best.\r\n\r\nOther events, belonging to the year 1739, must now be noticed.\r\n\r\nKingswood, so often mentioned, was formerly a royal chase, containing\r\nbetween three and four thousand acres; but, previous to the rise of\r\nMethodism, it had been gradually appropriated by the several lords\r\nwhose estates encircled it. The deer had disappeared, and the greater\r\npart of the wood also; coal mines had been discovered, and it was now\r\ninhabited by a race of people, as lawless as the foresters, their\r\nforefathers, but far more brutal; and differing as much from the\r\npeople of the surrounding country in dialect as in appearance. They\r\nhad no place of worship; for Kingswood then belonged to the parish of\r\nSt. Philip, and was, at least, three miles distant from the parish\r\nchurch.[308] The people were famous for neither fearing God nor\r\nregarding man; and so ignorant of sacred things that they seemed but\r\none remove from the beasts that perish. They were utterly without\r\ndesire of instruction, as well as without the means of it. The place\r\nresounded with cursing and blasphemy. It was filled with clamour\r\nand bitterness, wrath and envyings, idle diversions, drunkenness,\r\nand uncleanness;[309] a hell upon earth. Only fifteen weeks before\r\nWhitefield’s first visit, the colliers had risen with clubs and\r\nfirearms, and gone from pit to pit threatening the lives of all the\r\nworkmen who would not join them in defeating the ends of justice, in\r\nreference to a riot that had occurred a short time previously. At White\r\nHill, four mines were filled up; and carts, reels, and ropes belonging\r\nto others were cut and burned. The soldiers were called out, and the\r\nswarthy rioters ran away.[310]\r\n\r\nKingswood was Whitefield’s first field-pulpit, for here, on February\r\n17, 1739, he began his glorious career of out-door preaching. Within\r\nsix weeks after this, the day before Wesley came to Bristol, Whitefield\r\ndined with the colliers, who contributed upwards of £20 towards the\r\nerection of a school. Four days after this, the miners prepared him\r\nanother hospitable entertainment, after which he laid the foundation\r\nstone, knelt upon it, and offered prayer, to which the colliers said,\r\n“Amen.”[311]\r\n\r\nOn the same day, Whitefield took his departure from Bristol, leaving\r\nWesley as his successor; and, with the exception of a visit of a week’s\r\nduration in the month of July following, he was not at Kingswood\r\nagain during the next two years. Whitefield began the school at\r\nKingswood: the colliers gave upwards of £20; Whitefield collected\r\n£40 in subscriptions; and, on two subsequent occasions, he made\r\ncollections for the same purpose, once when he preached his farewell\r\nsermon at Bristol, on July 13, before embarking for America; and once\r\nin Moorfields, when the sum of £24 9_s._ was contributed.[312] This\r\nwas all. The rest devolved on Wesley. He alone was responsible for the\r\npayment of the debts incurred; and, for many months, wherever he went,\r\nhe begged subscriptions for the colliers’ school. The school itself\r\nconsisted of one large room, with four smaller ones for the teacher’s\r\nresidence, and was not completed till the spring of 1740.[313] The\r\nobject was to teach the children of the poor, first religion, and\r\nthen to read, write, and cast accounts; but Wesley also expected to\r\nhave “scholars of all ages, some of them grey-headed,” who were to\r\nbe taught, separate from the children, “either early in the morning,\r\nor late at night,” so that their work might not be hindered by their\r\neducation.[314]\r\n\r\nWithin six weeks after Whitefield laid the first stone of Kingswood\r\nschool, Wesley took possession of a piece of ground in the Horse\r\nFair, Bristol, and began to build a room large enough to contain the\r\nsocieties of Nicholas Street and Baldwin Street. This was done without\r\nthe least apprehension or design of his being personally engaged,\r\neither in the expense of the work, or in the direction of it; he having\r\nappointed eleven trustees, by whom he supposed the burdens would be\r\nborne. He soon found that he had made a great mistake. In a short time,\r\na debt was contracted of more than £150, whereas the subscriptions\r\nof the trustees and of the two societies were not a quarter of that\r\namount. This debt devolved upon him. He had no money, nor any human\r\nprospect or probability of procuring any; but he knew “the earth is the\r\nLord’s, and the fulness thereof,” and he dared to trust Him. Besides\r\nthis, Whitefield and other friends in London most strongly objected to\r\nthe building being the property of trustees, on the ground that Wesley\r\nwould be under their control; and, unless his preaching pleased them,\r\nthey might eject him from the house he himself had built. Whitefield\r\ndeclared that, unless the trustship was destroyed, neither he nor his\r\nfriends would contribute anything towards the expenses. Wesley yielded;\r\nthe trustees were summoned; all agreed to the alteration; the deed was\r\ncancelled; and Wesley became the sole proprietor.\r\n\r\nThis, though insignificant at the time, was a matter of great\r\nimportance; for, in this manner, nearly all the chapels, erected in the\r\nearly part of his career, were vested in himself,—a thing involving\r\nserious responsibility, which, however, was honourably fulfilled; for\r\ntrusts were afterwards created; and, by his “Deed of Declaration,” all\r\nhis interests in his chapels were transferred to his Legal Conference.\r\n\r\nThus we find Wesley, with no income whatever, except the small\r\namount arising out of his Oxford fellowship, involved in what, to\r\na poor man, were two serious undertakings. But even this was not\r\nall the burden that he took upon himself. He spent the beginning of\r\nNovember in London; and whilst there, two gentlemen, then unknown to\r\nhim, came again and again, urging him to preach in a place called\r\nthe Foundery, near Moorfields. With much reluctance he consented.\r\nHe writes:—“Sunday, November 11, I preached at eight to five or six\r\nthousand, on the spirit of bondage and the spirit of adoption; and, at\r\nfive in the evening, to seven or eight thousand, in the place which\r\nhad been the king’s foundery for cannon.”[315] He was then pressed to\r\ntake the place into his own hands. He did so. The purchase-money was\r\n£115; but the place being “a vast, uncouth heap of ruins,” a large\r\nsum additional to this had to be expended in needful repairs, in\r\nbuilding two galleries for men and women hearers respectively, and in\r\nenlarging a room for the society to almost thrice its present size.\r\nTo meet this large expenditure, Ball, Watkins, and other friends lent\r\nhim the purchase-money; and offered to pay subscriptions, some four,\r\nsome six, and some ten shillings a year towards the liquidation of\r\nthe debt. In three years, these subscriptions amounted to about £480,\r\nleaving however a balance of nearly £300, for which Wesley was still\r\nresponsible.[316] From this it would seem that the entire cost of the\r\nold Foundery was about £800.\r\n\r\nThis was the first Methodist meeting-house of which the metropolis\r\ncould boast, and a brief description of it may not be out of place.\r\n\r\nIt stood in the locality called “Windmill Hill,” now known by the name\r\nof Windmill Street, a street that runs parallel with City Road, and\r\nabuts on the north-west corner of Finsbury Square. The building was\r\nplaced on the east side of the street, some sixteen or eighteen yards\r\nfrom Providence Row; and measured about forty yards in front, from\r\nnorth to south, and about thirty-three yards in depth, from east to\r\nwest. There were two front doors, one leading to the chapel, and the\r\nother to the preacher’s house, school, and bandroom. A bell was hung\r\nin a plain belfry, and was rung every morning at five o’clock for\r\nearly service, and every evening at nine for family worship; as well\r\nas at sundry other times. The chapel, which would accommodate some\r\nfifteen hundred people, was without pews; but, on the ground floor,\r\nimmediately before the pulpit, were about a dozen seats with back\r\nrails, appropriated to female worshippers. Under the front gallery were\r\nthe free seats for women; and, under the side galleries, the free seats\r\nfor men. The front gallery was used exclusively by females, and the\r\nside galleries by males. “From the beginning,” says Wesley, “the men\r\nand women sat apart, as they always did in the primitive church; and\r\nnone were suffered to call any place their own, but the first comers\r\nsat down first. They had no pews; and all the benches for rich and poor\r\nwere of the same construction.”[317]\r\n\r\nThe bandroom was behind the chapel, on the ground floor, some eighty\r\nfeet long and twenty feet wide, and accommodated about three hundred\r\npersons. Here the classes met; here, in winter, the five o’clock\r\nmorning service was conducted; and here were held, at two o’clock, on\r\nWednesdays and Fridays, weekly meetings for prayer and intercession.\r\nThe north end of the room was used for a school, and was fitted up\r\nwith desks; and at the south end was “The Book Room” for the sale of\r\nWesley’s publications.\r\n\r\nOver the bandroom were apartments for Wesley, in which his mother\r\ndied;[318] and, at the end of the chapel was a dwelling house for his\r\ndomestics and assistant preachers; while attached to the whole was a\r\nsmall building used as a coach-house and stable.[319]\r\n\r\nWhy was the building called the Foundery? Because, for a number of\r\nyears, it was used by the government in casting cannon. When Wesley\r\nbought it, the edifice had been a ruin for about twenty years. In\r\n1716, whilst recasting the injured guns taken from the French in the\r\nsuccessful campaigns of Marlborough, a terrible explosion blew off the\r\nroof, shook the building, killed several of the workmen, burnt others,\r\nand broke the limbs of not a few. This led to an abandonment of the\r\nplace, and the removal of the royal foundery to Woolwich.[320] The next\r\noccupants were Wesley and the Methodists; and the echoes of prayer and\r\npraise succeeded the clang of anvils and the roar of furnaces of fire.\r\n\r\nWhen first opened, it was described by Silas Told as “a ruinous\r\nplace, with an old pantile covering,” the structure to a great extent\r\nconsisting of “decayed timbers,” and the pulpit being made of “a few\r\nrough boards.”[321] It may be interesting, to the curious reader, to\r\nadd, that a few years ago, the old Foundery bell, used in calling the\r\npeople to the five o’clock preaching, was still in existence, and was\r\nattached to the school at Friar’s Mount, London; that, at the present\r\nmoment, the old Foundery pulpit is preserved at Richmond, and is\r\nused by the Richmond students every week; and that the old Foundery\r\nchandelier is now in use in the chapel at Bowes, in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nThis was really the cradle of London Methodism. Here Wesley began\r\nto preach at the end of 1739. The character of the services held in\r\nthis rotten, pantile covered building may be learnt from Wesley’s\r\nWorks. Wesley began the service with a short prayer, then sung a hymn\r\nand preached (usually about half an hour), then sung a few verses\r\nof another hymn, and concluded with a prayer. His constant theme\r\nwas, salvation by faith, preceded by repentance, and followed by\r\nholiness.[322] The place was rough and the people poor; but the service\r\nsimple, scriptural, beautiful. No wonder, that such a priest, shut out\r\nof the elaborately wrought pulpits of the Established Church, and now\r\ncooped up within a pulpit made of “_rough_ deal boards,” should be\r\npowerful, popular, and triumphant.\r\n\r\nPassing from pulpits to preachers, we must venture here to correct\r\nan error, which, from the first, seems to have been current in the\r\nMethodist community. All Methodist historians have assumed that Thomas\r\nMaxfield was Methodism’s first lay preacher; that is, the first who was\r\nallowed to expound the Scriptures without being formally ordained to\r\nthat holy service. This is a mistake. Thomas Maxfield was not converted\r\nuntil the 21st of May, 1739; and yet, a month after this, we find John\r\nCennick, the converted land surveyor, employed with Wesley’s sanction,\r\nin preaching to the Kingswood colliers.\r\n\r\nMethodism’s first lay preacher deserves a passing notice. He has never\r\nyet had justice done him, and we regret that limited space prevents\r\njustice being rendered even here.\r\n\r\nJohn Cennick was the son of Quakers, and, from infancy, was taught to\r\npray every night and morning. At thirteen years of age, he went nine\r\ntimes, from Reading to London, to be apprenticed to a trade, but all\r\nto no purpose, except that he was taken on trial by a carpenter, who\r\nrefused to retain his services when the time was come for his being\r\nbound. In 1735, John was convinced of sin, while walking in Cheapside,\r\nand, at once, left off song singing, card playing, and attending\r\ntheatres. Sometimes he wished to go into a popish monastery, to spend\r\nhis life in devout retirement. At other times, he longed to live in\r\na cave, sleeping on fallen leaves, and feeding on forest fruits. He\r\nfasted long and often, and prayed nine times every day. He was afraid\r\nof seeing ghosts, and terribly apprehensive lest he should meet the\r\ndevil. Fancying dry bread too great an indulgence for so great a\r\nsinner as himself, he began to feed on potatoes, acorns, crabs, and\r\ngrass; and often wished he could live upon roots and herbs. At length,\r\non September 6, 1737, he found peace with God, and went on his way\r\nrejoicing. Like Howel Harris, he, at once, commenced preaching; and\r\nalso began to write hymns, a number of which Charles Wesley, in July,\r\n1739, corrected for the press.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that, in March, 1739, Wesley and Cennick met at\r\nReading. Shortly after that, Whitefield proposed that Cennick should\r\nbecome the master of the school in Kingswood, whose first stone was\r\nlaid in the month of May; and, on the 11th of June, off he set on\r\nfoot, from Reading to Bristol, sleeping all night in an old stable on\r\nhis way. On arriving there, he found that Wesley had gone to London;\r\nbut was invited to go to Kingswood to hear a young man (query, Thomas\r\nMaxfield?) read a sermon to the colliers. The place for meeting was\r\nunder a sycamore tree, near the intended school. Four or five hundred\r\ncolliers were assembled, but the young reader had not arrived. Cennick\r\nwas requested to take his place; he reluctantly complied, preached\r\na sermon, and says, “The Lord bore witness with my words, insomuch\r\nthat many believed in that hour.” Cennick preached again on the day\r\nfollowing, and on the succeeding sabbath twice.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Howel Harris came; and, on the ensuing Tuesday, Wesley. How\r\ndid Wesley receive the two lay preachers? Harris went to Wesley’s\r\nlodgings. They fell upon their knees; and Harris writes, “He was\r\ngreatly enlarged in prayer for me, and for all Wales.” Full of holy\r\nfeeling, the Welsh evangelist crossed the channel, and found wider\r\ndoors of usefulness than ever. Cennick too was not restrained. He tells\r\nus, that many of the people desired Wesley to forbid him; but, so far\r\nfrom doing so, he encouraged him; and, thus encouraged, he preached\r\nconstantly in Kingswood and the neighbouring villages for the next\r\neighteen months, and sometimes supplied Wesley’s place in Bristol, when\r\nhe was absent, preaching in other towns.[323]\r\n\r\nHonour to whom honour is due. We repudiate the wish to take from\r\nMaxfield a particle of fame, which of right belongs to him; but there\r\ncannot be a doubt that John Cennick was one of Wesley’s lay preachers\r\nbefore Maxfield was. Neither is there aught contradictory to this in\r\nWesley’s writings. It is true, that Wesley, after mentioning that the\r\nfirst society was formed at the end of 1739, goes on to say: “After a\r\ntime, a young man, Thomas Maxfield, came and desired to help me as a\r\nson in the gospel;”[324] but this is not opposed to the fact, that John\r\nCennick had already helped him at Kingswood, Bristol, and other places.\r\nMyles thinks that it is probable, that Maxfield, Richards, and Westall\r\nwere all employed by Wesley in the beginning of the year 1740.[325]\r\nPerhaps so; but we have already seen that Cennick was preaching, with\r\nthe approbation and encouragement of Wesley, as early as the month of\r\nJune, 1739.[326]\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to pursue the footsteps of Methodism’s first lay\r\npreacher. Suffice it to remark, though his career was comparatively\r\nshort, in zealous and successful labour it is difficult to equal it.\r\nCennick had his weaknesses; but, in deadness to the world, communion\r\nwith God, Christian courage, and cheerful patience, he had few\r\nsuperiors. Despite his Calvinism and his differences with Wesley, we\r\nadmire and love the man. He died in 1755.\r\n\r\nHere then was another momentous step taken by the arch-Methodist.\r\nWesley had been bred within a strict ecclesiastical enclosure. He was\r\nfirm in his attachment to the principles and practices of the English\r\nChurch, and was far from being indifferent to the prerogatives of its\r\npriests; but he was far too wise and reverent a man to say that the\r\nsalvation of the human family would be too dearly purchased if promoted\r\nby a departure from church usages. Christianity, though conserved by\r\nchurch order, does not exist for the sake of it. As a student of church\r\nhistory, Wesley must have known that, again and again, unless order\r\nhad given way to a higher necessity, the gospel, instead of holding on\r\nits way in its brightness and in its purity, would, long ere now, in\r\nthe hands of idolizers of ancient rules, have been extinguished in the\r\nvery path where it ought to have shed an unceasing flame. In no man was\r\nthere a greater combination of docility and courage; and hence, when\r\nWesley met with men like Cennick, full of fervent consciousness of the\r\nreality, power, and blessedness of Christ’s religion; and employing a\r\nstyle, terse from intensity of feeling, and copious from the fulness of\r\ntheir theme,—no wonder that, instead of forbidding, he encouraged them\r\nto preach the glorious truths, which they not merely understood, but\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nThis was a startling innovation; and, doubtless, horrified the\r\nstereotyped ministries and priesthoods existing round about; but the\r\nfields were white to the harvest, and the labourers were few; and\r\nWesley could not, durst not, forbid an increase to the staff, because\r\nthe added workers had not been trained in colleges, and came not in all\r\nthe priestly paraphernalia of surplices and hoods, gowns and bands. No\r\ndoubt he would have preferred the employment of clerics like himself;\r\nbut, in the absence of such, he was driven to adopt the measure which\r\nwe think the salvation of his system, and, in some respects, its glory.\r\n\r\n“I knew your brother well,” said Robinson, the Archbishop of Armagh,\r\nwhen he met Charles Wesley at the Hotwells, Bristol: “I knew your\r\nbrother well; I could never credit all I heard respecting him and you;\r\nbut one thing in your conduct I could never account for, your employing\r\nlaymen.” “My Lord,” said Charles, “the fault is yours and your\r\nbrethren’s.” “How so?” asked the primate. “Because you hold your peace,\r\nand the stones cry out.” “But I am told,” his grace continued, “that\r\nthey are unlearned men.” “Some are,” said the sprightly poet, “and so\r\nthe dumb ass rebukes the prophet.” His lordship said no more.[327]\r\n\r\nThe following letter of Whitefield has not been previously printed so\r\nfully as at present. As it was written at the time when Cennick began\r\npreaching, it may appropriately be inserted here. Its references to\r\nother matters are also deeply interesting.\r\n\r\n    “LONDON, _June 25, 1739_.\r\n\r\n    “HONOURED SIR,—I suspend my judgment of Brother Watkins’ and\r\n    Cennick’s behaviour till I am better acquainted with the\r\n    circumstances of their proceeding. I think there is a great\r\n    difference between them and Howel Harris. He has offered\r\n    himself thrice for holy orders; him therefore and our friends\r\n    at Cambridge I shall encourage: others I cannot countenance in\r\n    acting in so public a manner. The consequences of beginning to\r\n    teach too soon will be exceeding bad—Brother Ingham is of my\r\n    opinion.\r\n\r\n    “I hear, honoured sir, you are about to print a sermon on\r\n    predestination. It shocks me to think of it; what will be the\r\n    consequences but controversy? If people ask me my opinion,\r\n    what shall I do? I have a critical part to act, God enable me\r\n    to behave aright! Silence on both sides will be best. It is\r\n    noised abroad already, that there is a division between you and\r\n    me. Oh, my heart within me is grieved!\r\n\r\n    “Providence to-morrow calls me to Gloucester. If you will be\r\n    pleased to come next week to London, I think, God willing, to\r\n    stay a few days at Bristol. Your brother Charles goes to Oxon.\r\n    I believe we shall be excommunicated soon. May the Lord enable\r\n    us to stand fast in the faith; and stir up your heart to watch\r\n    over the soul of, honoured sir,\r\n\r\n    “Your dutiful son and servant,\r\n    GEORGE WHITEFIELD.\r\n\r\n    “To the Rev. Mr. John Wesley, at Mrs. Grevil’s,\r\n    a Grocer in Wine Street, Bristol.”\r\n\r\nWe must proceed to another matter. Wesley writes:—\r\n\r\n    “In the latter end of the year 1739, eight or ten persons came\r\n    to me in London, who appeared to be deeply convinced of sin,\r\n    and earnestly groaning for redemption. They desired, I would\r\n    spend some time with them in prayer, and advise them how to\r\n    flee from the wrath to come. That we might have more time for\r\n    this great work, I appointed a day when they might all come\r\n    together, which, from thenceforward, they did every Thursday,\r\n    in the evening. To these, and as many more as desired to join\r\n    with them, (for the number increased daily,) I gave those\r\n    advices, from time to time, which I judged most needful for\r\n    them; and we always concluded our meeting with prayer suited\r\n    to their several necessities. This was the rise of the United\r\n    Society, first in London, and then in other places.”[328]\r\n\r\nIn another place, he writes:—\r\n\r\n    “The first evening about twelve persons came; the next week,\r\n    thirty or forty. When they were increased to about a hundred,\r\n    I took down their names and places of abode, intending, as\r\n    often as it was convenient, to call upon them at their houses.\r\n    Thus, without any previous plan, began the Methodist Society in\r\n    England,—a company of people associating together to help each\r\n    other to work out their own salvation.”[329]\r\n\r\nNo doubt the whole of this is strictly true; but there are other facts\r\nto be remembered.\r\n\r\nBy the preaching of the two Wesleys and of Whitefield, a large number\r\nof persons in London had been converted; and most of these had been\r\nincorporated in the Moravian bands. When Wesley went to Bristol, at the\r\nend of March, the work in London devolved, to a great extent, on his\r\nbrother Charles. Disputes soon sprung up. On Easter day, Charles had\r\na conversation with Zinzendorf “about motions, visions, and dreams,\r\nand was confirmed in his dislike to them.” On April 28, Whitefield\r\npreached in Islington churchyard; and, after he had done, Bowers, a\r\nMoravian, got up to speak. Charles Wesley says: “I conjured him not;\r\nbut he beat me down, and followed _his impulse_.” On the 16th of\r\nMay, a dispute arose, in the Moravian meeting at Fetter Lane, about\r\nlay preaching. Many were zealous for it; but Whitefield and Charles\r\nWesley declared against it. In June, another Moravian, John Shaw,\r\n“the self-ordained priest,” as Charles Wesley calls him, “was brimful\r\nof proud wrath and fierceness”; and two others, Bowers and Bray,\r\nwhom Whitefield designated “two grand enthusiasts,” followed Charles\r\nto Blendon, “drunk with the spirit of delusion.” In the Moravian\r\nsociety, Shaw “pleaded for his spirit of prophecy”; and charged Charles\r\nWesley “with love of pre-eminence, and with making his proselytes\r\ntwofold more the children of the devil than they were before.” Many\r\nmisunderstandings and offences had crept in; and Wesley came from\r\nBristol to put things right. A humiliation meeting was held at Fetter\r\nLane; and “we acknowledged,” says Wesley, “our having grieved God by\r\nour divisions; ‘one saying, I am of Paul; another, I am of Apollos’; by\r\nour leaning again to our own works, and trusting in them, instead of\r\nChrist; by our resting in those little beginnings of sanctification,\r\nwhich it had pleased Him to work in our souls; and, above all, by\r\nblaspheming His work among us, imputing it either to nature, to the\r\nforce of imagination and animal spirits, or even to the delusion of\r\nthe devil.” Things seem to have proceeded more smoothly till about\r\nSeptember, when, in the absence of the two Wesleys, “certain men\r\ncrept in among them unawares, telling them, that they had deceived\r\nthemselves, and had no true faith at all. ‘For,’ said they, ‘none has\r\nany justifying faith, who has ever any doubt or fear, which you know\r\nyou have; or who has not a clean heart, which you know you have not;\r\nnor will you ever have it, till you leave off running to church and\r\nsacrament, and praying, and singing, and reading either the Bible,\r\nor any other book; for you cannot use these things without trusting\r\nin them. Therefore, till you leave them off, you can never have true\r\nfaith; you can never till then trust in the blood of Christ.’”[330]\r\n\r\nThis was a serious heresy; and, on November 1, Wesley hurried up to\r\nLondon to put a check to it. He acknowledges, that the Moravians\r\nstill held the grand doctrine of justification by faith; and that the\r\nfruits of faith were “righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.”\r\nHe testifies, that they were free from the sins of swearing, theft,\r\ngluttony, drunkenness, and adultery; that they had no diversions but\r\nsuch as become saints; that they regarded not outward adorning, and\r\nwere not slothful in business. He confesses, that they fed the hungry,\r\nand clothed the naked; that their discipline was scarce inferior to\r\nthat of the apostolic age; and, that every one knew and kept his proper\r\nplace; but, despite all this, he found them far from perfect.\r\n\r\nOn first entering the society, he found Mr. Bray “highly commending\r\nthe being still before God; and speaking largely of the danger that\r\nattended the doing of outward works, and of the folly of people running\r\nabout to church and sacrament.”\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, November 4, the “society met at seven in the morning, and\r\ncontinued silent till eight.” In the evening, at Fetter Lane, “some\r\nof the brethren asserted in plain terms: 1. That, till they had true\r\nfaith, they ought to be still; that is, to abstain from the means of\r\ngrace, the Lord’s supper in particular. 2. That the ordinances are not\r\nmeans of grace, there being no other means than Christ.”\r\n\r\nThree days later, Wesley had a long conference with Spangenberg, who\r\nsubstantially avowed the same opinions. At night, the Fetter Lane\r\nsociety sat an hour without speaking; and then there followed a warm\r\ndispute, to prove that none ought to receive the Lord’s supper till\r\nhe had “the full assurance of faith.” Every day Wesley met with many\r\n“who once knew in whom they had believed, but were now thrown into idle\r\nreasonings, and were filled with doubts and fears. Many had left off\r\nthe means of grace, saying they must now cease from their own works,\r\nand must trust in Christ alone; that they were poor sinners, and had\r\nnothing to do but to lie at His feet.”\r\n\r\nWesley did his utmost to correct this state of things, and then, on\r\nNovember 21, went back to Bristol. On his way, he came to Wycombe,\r\nwhere he unexpectedly met Mr. Gambold and a Mr. Robson. He writes:\r\n“After much consultation and prayer, we agreed—1. To meet yearly at\r\nLondon on the eve of Ascension day. 2. To fix then the business to be\r\ndone the ensuing year; where, when, and by whom. 3. To meet quarterly\r\nthere, as many as can; viz., on the second Tuesday in July, October,\r\nand January. 4. To send a monthly account to one another, of what\r\nGod hath done in each of our stations. 5. To inquire whether Messrs.\r\nHall, Sympson, Rogers, Ingham, Hutchins, Kinchin, Stonehouse, Cennick,\r\nOxlee, and Brown will join with us herein. 6. To consider whether there\r\nbe any others of our spiritual friends, who are able and willing so\r\nto do.”[331] This arrangement is important as indicative of Wesley’s\r\npurpose at this early period of his history; but it was never put into\r\nexecution. The rupture with the Moravians made it a dead letter.\r\n\r\nFive weeks afterwards, he returned to London with a heavy heart.\r\n“Scarce one in ten of the Moravians retained his first love; and most\r\nof the rest were in the utmost confusion, biting and devouring one\r\nanother.” His soul was sick of their “sublime divinity.” He had a long\r\nconversation with Molther, one of their ministers, and ascertained that\r\nthe difference between them was the following:—\r\n\r\n1. The Moravians held that there are no degrees of faith; and that no\r\nman has any degree of it, before he has the full assurance of faith,\r\nthe abiding witness of the Spirit, or the clear perception that Christ\r\ndwelleth in him. Wesley dissented from this.\r\n\r\n2. The Moravians taught that the way to attain faith is to wait for\r\nChrist, and be still: that is, not to use the means of grace; not to go\r\nto church; not to communicate; not to fast; not to use private prayer;\r\nnot to read the Scriptures; not to do temporal good; nor to attempt\r\ndoing spiritual good; because it was impossible for a man to use means\r\nlike these without trusting in them. Wesley believed just the opposite.\r\n\r\n3. The Moravians thought that in propagating faith, guile might be\r\nused: (1) By saying what we know will deceive the hearers, or lead them\r\nto think the thing which is not; (2) by describing things a little\r\nbeyond the truth, in order to their coming up to it; (3) by speaking as\r\nif we meant what we did not mean. Wesley denounced all this.\r\n\r\n4. The Moravians believed that the fruits of their thus propagating\r\nthe faith in England were: (1) Much good had been done by it; (2) many\r\nwere unsettled from a false foundation; (3) many were brought into true\r\nstillness; (4) some were grounded on the true foundation, who were\r\nwrong before. Wesley, on the contrary, thought that very little good,\r\nbut much hurt, had been done, by such proceedings.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things when Wesley “began the first Methodist\r\nsociety in England.” He was dissatisfied with his old Moravian friends,\r\nand well he might. He had been prominent in the formation of their\r\nsociety at Fetter Lane, on the 1st of May, 1738; but his hopes and\r\naspirations concerning it were blighted; and hence he formed another\r\nsociety of his own. Moravian heresies had, in London at least,\r\ncorrupted the Moravian bands; numbers were offended; these and others\r\nrepaired to Wesley; Wesley took down their names, and met them every\r\nThursday evening for spiritual advice and prayer; success followed; and\r\nthe Methodist society was instituted. We must return to this subject in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\nWesley spent most of the year 1739 in Bristol and the immediate\r\nneighbourhood; but, at different times, he rendered important service\r\nin other places. At Blackheath, he preached to twelve or fourteen\r\nthousand people; and on Kennington Common to twenty thousand. In\r\nMoorfields, he had a congregation of ten thousand. In Gloucester he\r\npreached to seven thousand;[332] and in Bath, Bradford, and elsewhere,\r\nto great multitudes. He also preached, at least once, in the mansion of\r\nLady Huntingdon, taking a bold text for such a fashionable audience:\r\n“The cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the\r\ndesires of other things, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.”\r\n\r\nHe also met with some adventures and incidents worth mentioning. In\r\nriding to Rose Green, his horse suddenly fell, and rolled over and\r\nover. A gentleman, at Bradford, who had wished him good luck in\r\nthe name of the Lord, told him that his fellow collegians at Oxford\r\nalways considered him “a little crack-brained.” In one instance, the\r\npressgang came when he was in the middle of his sermon, and seized one\r\nof his hearers. While preaching in Turner’s Hall, London, the floor\r\ngave way, but fortunately the vault below was filled with hogsheads of\r\ntobacco, so that the crowded congregation only sunk a foot or two, and\r\nhe proceeded without further interruption. At Oxford, he was grieved\r\nto find that none now visited the workhouse and the prison, and that\r\nthe Methodist little school was about to be given up. At Stanley, on\r\na little green, he preached for two hours amid the darkness of an\r\nOctober night. At Newport, he addressed “the most insensible, ill\r\nbehaved people” he had seen in Wales; one old man cursing and swearing\r\nincessantly, and taking up a great stone to throw at him. The people of\r\nWales generally he found as ignorant of gospel truth as the Cherokee\r\nIndians; and asks, “What spirit is he of, who had rather these poor\r\ncreatures should perish for lack of knowledge than that they should\r\nbe saved, even by the exhortations of Howel Harris, or an itinerant\r\npreacher?” Words these well worth pondering; for they are added proof,\r\nthat Wesley, even as early as 1739, was not opposed to the employment\r\nof lay evangelists.\r\n\r\nThe principle upon which Wesley acted was to shrink from nothing that\r\nhe judged to be conducive to his being made a Christian.[333] On this\r\nground he went to Georgia, and to Germany; and says, “I am ready to\r\ngo to Abyssinia or China, or whithersoever it shall please God to\r\ncall me.” He was accused of being an enemy of the Church of England;\r\nbut maintained that he was not. The doctrines he preached were the\r\ndoctrines of the Church, as laid down in her prayers, articles, and\r\nhomilies. He allows that there were five points of difference between\r\nhim and many of the clergy; but he contends that _they_, not _he_,\r\nwere unfaithful to the Church. The points were these:—1. Those from\r\nwhom he differed spoke of justification, either as the same thing with\r\nsanctification, or as something consequent upon it. He believed it to\r\nbe wholly distinct from sanctification, and necessarily antecedent\r\nto it. 2. They spoke of good works as the cause of justification. He\r\nbelieved the death and righteousness of Christ to be the whole and\r\nsole cause of it. 3. They spoke of good works as existing previous to\r\njustification. He believed that no good work is possible, previous to\r\njustification, and therefore no good work can be a condition of it;\r\ntill we are justified we are ungodly, and incapable of good works; we\r\nare justified by faith alone, faith without works, faith producing all\r\ngood works, yet including none. 4. They spoke of sanctification as if\r\nit were an outward thing. He believed it to be an inward thing,—the\r\nlife of God in the soul of man; a participation of the Divine nature;\r\nthe mind that was in Christ. 5. They spoke of the new birth as\r\nsynonymous with baptism; or, at most, a change from a vicious to a\r\nvirtuous life. He believed it to be an entire change of nature, from\r\nthe image of the devil, wherein we are born, to the image of God;\r\na change from earthly and sensual to heavenly and holy affections.\r\n“There is, therefore,” says he, “a wide, essential, fundamental,\r\nirreconcilable difference between us. If they speak the truth as it is\r\nin Jesus, I am found a false witness before God. But if I teach the way\r\nof God in truth, they are blind leaders of the blind.”[334] He contends\r\nthat he “simply described the plain, old religion of the Church of\r\nEngland, which was now almost everywhere spoken against, under the new\r\nname of Methodism.”[335]\r\n\r\nWesley was a great reader; and some of the most interesting entries\r\nin his Journals are his critiques on books; but, in 1739, he seems to\r\nhave been too busy preaching to have had time for reading. The only\r\nnotice of this kind is the following: “1739, October 23. In riding to\r\nBradford, I read over Mr. Law’s book on the new birth. Philosophical,\r\nspeculative, precarious; Behmenish, void, and vain! ‘O what a fall is\r\nthere!’” This is a harsh reflection upon an old friend; but, about a\r\nyear and a half before, there had been the unfortunate quarrel with\r\nWilliam Law, already mentioned. See pp. 185‒8.\r\n\r\nUp to the present, Wesley’s mother had been his chief counsellor.\r\nImmediately after his conversion in May, 1738, he went to Germany,\r\nand returned to England in September. It so happened, that he and his\r\nmother had no interview until nine months after this. Before he went to\r\nHerrnhuth, he had related to her the particulars of his conversion, for\r\nwhich “she heartily blessed God, who had brought him to so just a way\r\nof thinking.” Meanwhile, however, she had been prejudiced against him,\r\nand had entertained “strange fears concerning him, being convinced that\r\nhe had greatly erred from the faith.” This was not of long continuance.\r\nHence the following entry in Wesley’s journal:—\r\n\r\n    “1739, September 3.—I talked largely with my mother, who told\r\n    me that, till a short time since, she had scarce heard such\r\n    a thing mentioned as the having God’s Spirit bearing witness\r\n    with our spirit: much less did she imagine that this was the\r\n    common privilege of all true believers. ‘Therefore,’ said she,\r\n    ‘I never durst ask for it myself. But two or three weeks ago,\r\n    while my son Hall was pronouncing these words, in delivering\r\n    the cup to me, “The blood of our Lord Jesus Christ which was\r\n    given for thee,” the words struck through my heart, and I knew\r\n    God, for Christ’s sake, had forgiven me all my sins.‘ “I asked\r\n    whether her father (Dr. Annesley) had not the same faith;\r\n    and whether she had not heard him preach it to others. She\r\n    answered, he had it himself; and declared, a little before his\r\n    death, that, for more than forty years, he had no darkness, no\r\n    fear, no doubt at all of his being accepted in the Beloved.\r\n    But that, nevertheless, she did not remember to have heard him\r\n    preach, no, not once, explicitly upon it: whence she supposed\r\n    he also looked upon it as the peculiar blessing of a few; not\r\n    as promised to all the people of God.”[336]\r\n\r\nEver after this, Susannah Wesley resided chiefly in London, and\r\nattended the ministry of her sons John and Charles. She heartily\r\nembraced their doctrines, and conversed with the members of their\r\nsociety. Hence the following from one of her letters to Charles, dated\r\nDecember 27, 1739:—\r\n\r\n    “Your brother, whom I shall henceforth call _Son Wesley_,\r\n    since my dear Sam is gone home, has just been with me, and\r\n    much revived my spirits. Indeed, I have often found that he\r\n    never speaks in my hearing without my receiving some spiritual\r\n    benefit. But his visits are seldom and short; for which I never\r\n    blame him, because I know he is well employed, and, blessed be\r\n    God, hath great success in his ministry. But, my dear Charles,\r\n    still I want either him or you; for, indeed, in the most\r\n    literal sense, I am become a little child, and need continual\r\n    succour. For these several days, I have had the conversation\r\n    of many good Christians, who have refreshed, in some measure,\r\n    my fainting spirits. I hope we shall shortly speak face to\r\n    face. But then, alas! when you come, your brother leaves me!\r\n    Yet that is the will of God, in whose blessed service you are\r\n    engaged; who has hitherto blessed your labours, and preserved\r\n    your persons. That He may continue so to prosper your work, and\r\n    protect you both from evil, and give you strength and courage\r\n    to preach the true gospel, in opposition to the united powers\r\n    of evil men and evil angels, is the hearty prayer of, dear\r\n    Charles,\r\n\r\n    “Your loving mother,\r\n    “SUSANNAH WESLEY.”[337]\r\n\r\nReference is made in the above extract to the death of Samuel Wesley,\r\nwhich occurred on November 6, 1739, at the early age of forty-nine. Up\r\nto the very last, he was strongly opposed to the Methodist movement of\r\nhis brothers. In a letter to his mother, written only seventeen days\r\nbefore his death, he says:—\r\n\r\n    “My brothers are now become so notorious, that the world will\r\n    be curious to know when and where they were born, what schools\r\n    bred at, what colleges of in Oxford, and when matriculated,\r\n    what degrees they took, and where, when, and by whom ordained.\r\n    I wish they may spare so much time as to vouchsafe a little\r\n    of their story. For my own part, I had much rather have them\r\n    picking straws within the walls, than preaching in the area of\r\n    Moorfields.\r\n\r\n    “It was with exceeding concern and grief, I heard you had\r\n    countenanced a spreading delusion, so far as to be one of\r\n    Jack’s congregation. Is it not enough that I am bereft of both\r\n    my brothers, but must my mother follow too? I earnestly beseech\r\n    the Almighty to preserve you from joining a schism at the close\r\n    of your life, as you were unfortunately engaged in one at the\r\n    beginning of it. It will cost you many a protest, should you\r\n    retain your integrity, as I hope to God you will. They boast of\r\n    you already as a disciple.\r\n\r\n    “They design separation. They are already forbidden all the\r\n    pulpits in London; and to preach in that diocese is actual\r\n    schism. In all likelihood, it will come to the same all over\r\n    England, if the bishops have courage enough. They leave off the\r\n    liturgy in the fields; and though Mr. Whitefield expresses\r\n    his value for it, he never once read it to his tatterdemalions\r\n    on a common. Their societies are sufficient to dissolve all\r\n    other societies but their own. Will any man of common sense, or\r\n    spirit, suffer any domestic to be in a band, engaged to relate\r\n    to five or to ten people everything, without reserve, that\r\n    concerns the person’s conscience, howmuchsoever it may concern\r\n    the family? Ought any married persons to be there, unless\r\n    husband and wife be there together? This is literally putting\r\n    asunder whom God hath joined together.\r\n\r\n    “As I told Jack, I am not afraid the Church should\r\n    excommunicate him (discipline is at too low an ebb), but, that\r\n    he should excommunicate the Church. It is pretty near it.\r\n    Holiness and good works are not so much as _conditions_ of our\r\n    acceptance with God. Lovefeasts are introduced, and extemporary\r\n    prayers, and expositions of Scripture, which last are enough\r\n    to bring in all confusion; nor is it likely they will want any\r\n    miracles to support them. He only who ruleth the madness of the\r\n    people can stop them from being a formed sect. Ecclesiastical\r\n    censures have lost their terrors; thank fanaticism on the one\r\n    hand, and atheism on the other. To talk of persecution from\r\n    thence is mere insult. It is—\r\n\r\n    “To call the bishop, Grey-beard Goff,\r\n    And make his power as mere a scoff\r\n    As Dagon, when his hands were off.”[338]\r\n\r\nSixteen nights after writing the above, Samuel Wesley went to bed as\r\nwell as usual. At three next morning, he was seized with illness,\r\nand, four hours afterwards, expired. John Wesley, at the time, was in\r\nLondon, and Charles in Bristol; but, as soon as possible, they hastened\r\nto Tiverton, where they rejoiced to hear that, several days before he\r\nwent hence, God had given to their brother a calm and full assurance of\r\nhis interest in Christ.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the events of the year 1739, it only remains to notice\r\nWesley’s publications. These were the following:—\r\n\r\n1. “An Abstract of the Life and Death of Mr. Thomas Halyburton. With\r\nrecommendatory Epistle by George Whitefield, and Preface by John\r\nWesley.” Oswald: London. 1739.\r\n\r\nHalyburton was a Scotchman, and was born in 1674. At the age of\r\ntwenty-six, he became a Presbyterian minister. Ten years afterwards,\r\nhe was appointed Professor of Divinity in the college of St. Andrews;\r\nbut almost immediately was seized with pleurisy, and died in the\r\nthirty-seventh year of his age.\r\n\r\nWesley’s preface is dated “London, February 9, 1739,” and the book\r\nwas published within a few weeks afterwards; for Wesley’s brother\r\nSamuel, in a letter bearing date, April 16, 1739, says: “I have got\r\nyour abridgment of Halyburton; and, if it please God to allow me life\r\nand strength, I shall demonstrate that the Scot as little deserves\r\npreference to all Christians, as the book to all writings but those you\r\nmention. There are two flagrant falsehoods in the very first chapter.\r\nBut your eyes are so fixed upon one point, that you overlook everything\r\nelse. You overshoot, but Whitefield raves.”[339]\r\n\r\nWesley’s abridged Life of Halyburton is a beautifully written, and\r\nmost edifying book. Why did Wesley publish it? There can be but\r\nlittle doubt that his chief reasons were:—1. Because it contains a\r\nliving exemplification of real religion. And 2. Because Halyburton’s\r\nstruggles, doubts, fears, and general experience, previous to his\r\nfinding peace with God, through faith in Christ, bear a striking\r\nresemblance to the case of Wesley himself. After describing that the\r\nkingdom of God, within us, is holiness and happiness, and that the way\r\nof attaining it is a true and living faith, Wesley, in his preface,\r\nsays: “This work of God in the soul of man is so described in the\r\nfollowing treatise, as I have not seen it in any other, either ancient\r\nor modern, in our own or any other language; so that I cannot but value\r\nit, next to the holy Scripture, above any other human composition,\r\nexcept only the ‘Christian’s Pattern,’ and the small remains of Clemens\r\nRomanus, Polycarp, and Ignatius.”\r\n\r\nIn the same preface, Wesley propounds thus early a doctrine, which\r\nafterwards held a conspicuous place in the system of truth he taught.\r\nIn answering the objection, that “the gospel covenant does not promise\r\nentire freedom from sin,” he writes: “What do you mean by the word\r\nsin? Do you mean those numberless weaknesses and follies, sometimes\r\nimproperly termed sins of infirmity? If so, we shall not put off these\r\nbut with our bodies. But if you mean, it does not promise entire\r\nfreedom from sin, in its proper sense, or from committing it, this is\r\nby no means true, unless the Scripture be false. Though it is possible\r\na man may be a child of God, who is not fully freed from sin, it does\r\nnot follow that freedom from sin is impossible; or that it is not to\r\nbe expected by all. It is described by the Holy Ghost as the common\r\nprivilege of all.”\r\n\r\n2. Another of Wesley’s publications, in 1739, was entitled: “Nicodemus;\r\nor, a Treatise on the Fear of Man. From the German of Augustus Herman\r\nFrancke. Abridged by John Wesley.” Bristol: S. and F. Farley. 1739.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the treatise was peculiarly adapted to Wesley’s present\r\nposition; and the whole is written in his best, nervous, clear, classic\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\n3. Wesley’s third publication was two treatises of ninety-nine pages,\r\n12mo; the first on Justification by Faith only; the second on the\r\nSinfulness of Man’s Natural Will, and his utter inability to do works\r\nacceptable to God until he be justified and born again of the Spirit\r\nof God: by Dr. Barnes. “With Preface, containing some account of the\r\nauthor, extracted from the Book of Martyrs. By John Wesley.”\r\n\r\nThis was another book congenial to Wesley’s present feelings; inasmuch\r\nas it was full of the great doctrine, which was now the theme of his\r\ndaily ministry.\r\n\r\n4. Towards the end of 1739,[340] Wesley published his tract, entitled\r\n“The Character of a Methodist.” He states, that the name of Methodists\r\nis not one which they have taken to themselves, but one fixed upon them\r\nby way of reproach, without their approbation or consent. The tract was\r\nwritten at the urgent request of numbers of people, who were anxious\r\nto know what were “the principles, practice, and distinguishing marks\r\nof the sect which was everywhere spoken against.” The distinguishing\r\nmarks of a Methodist are, not his opinions, though the Methodists\r\nare fundamentally distinguished from Jews, Turks, and infidels; from\r\nPapists; and from Socinians and Arians: neither are the marks of a\r\nMethodist “words or phrases:” nor “actions, customs, or usages of an\r\nindifferent nature:” nor the laying of the whole stress of religion on\r\nany single part of it. “A Methodist is one who has the love of God shed\r\nabroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost given unto him; one who loves\r\nthe Lord his God with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with\r\nall his mind, and with all his strength. He rejoices evermore, prays\r\nwithout ceasing, and in everything gives thanks. His heart is full of\r\nlove to all mankind, and is purified from envy, malice, wrath, and\r\nevery unkind or malign affection. His own desire, and the one design of\r\nhis life is not to do his own will, but the will of Him that sent him.\r\nHe keeps not only some, or most of God’s commandments, but all, from\r\nthe least to the greatest. He follows not the customs of the world;\r\nfor vice does not lose its nature through its becoming fashionable. He\r\nfares not sumptuously every day. He cannot lay up treasures upon earth\r\nany more than he can take fire into his bosom. He cannot adorn himself,\r\non any pretence, with gold or costly apparel. He cannot join in any\r\ndiversion that has the least tendency to vice. He cannot speak evil of\r\nhis neighbour, no more than he can tell a lie. He cannot utter unkind,\r\nor idle words. No corrupt communication ever comes out of his mouth.\r\nHe does good unto all men; unto neighbours and strangers, friends and\r\nenemies.” “These,” says Wesley, “are the principles and practices of\r\nour sect; these are the marks of a true Methodist. By these alone do\r\nMethodists desire to be distinguished from other men.”\r\n\r\nSuch were Methodists when Methodism was first founded in 1739. No\r\nwonder God was with them, and honoured them with such success. Is John\r\nWesley’s Character of a Methodist descriptive of all the Methodists\r\nliving now? Would to God it were!\r\n\r\n5. Another of Wesley’s publications, in 1739, was entitled: “Hymns\r\nand Sacred Poems. Published by John Wesley, M.A., Fellow of Lincoln\r\nCollege, Oxford; and Charles Wesley, M.A., Student of Christ Church,\r\nOxford.” London: 12mo, pages 223.\r\n\r\nAs this book has recently been reprinted by the Methodist Conference\r\nOffice, (“Wesley Poetry,” vol. i.,) a detailed description of its\r\ncontents is not necessary. Suffice it to remark, that, besides the\r\nproductions of his brother, the volume contains at least twenty\r\ntranslations from the German by Wesley himself, and that these are\r\namong the finest hymns the Methodists ever sing. In fact, with a few\r\nexceptions, the hymns of the two Wesleys are the only productions in\r\nthe book worth having. Many are devout but literary rubbish, and\r\nutterly unworthy of being used in public worship. Some of the poems are\r\npassable; a few are beautiful; but others might have been left, without\r\nany loss to the Christian public, in the limbo of oblivion. Had the\r\npublication consisted only of John and Charles Wesley’s hymns, it would\r\nhave been one of the choicest productions ever printed; as in other\r\nthings, so in this, an admixture made it weak.\r\n\r\n6. It may be added, that it was probably in 1739 that Wesley published\r\nan extract of his journal, from his embarking for Georgia, October 14,\r\n1735, to his return to London, February 1, 1737; but of this we are not\r\ncertain, the first edition being without date.\r\n\r\nThe substance of this has been already given, and hence we pass, at\r\nonce, to the year 1740.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1740.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1740 Age 37]\r\n\r\nThe Moravian wranglings brought Wesley to the metropolis in 1739; and,\r\non the 3rd of January following, he left his friends, still “subverting\r\none another’s souls by idle controversies and strife of words;” and\r\ncame to Bristol on January 9.\r\n\r\nHere he purposed to remain; but within a month he was back to London. A\r\nyoung surgeon, of the name of Snowde, had met in Bristol a man of the\r\nname of Ramsey, who in a state of destitution and distress had applied\r\nto Wesley for relief. Wesley employed him in writing and in keeping\r\naccounts for him, and afterwards in teaching a school instituted by the\r\nBristol society.[341] Ramsey brought the young surgeon to hear Wesley\r\npreach. Both were rascals, and availed themselves of an opportunity of\r\nstealing £30 that had been collected towards building Kingswood school.\r\nSnowde went off to London; fell in with his old acquaintance; committed\r\nhighway robbery; was arrested, tried, and condemned to die. While in\r\nNewgate, awaiting the execution of his sentence, he wrote to a friend,\r\nadjuring Wesley, “by the living God,” to come and see him before his\r\ndeath. Wesley, who had been robbed so sacrilegiously, started off,\r\non a journey of more than two hundred miles, purposely to visit the\r\nconvict thief. He found him apparently penitent, and having only a week\r\nto live. On the day before his sentence was to be executed, the poor\r\ncreature wrote:—“I trust God has forgiven me all my sins, washing them\r\naway in the blood of the Lamb.” Next morning a reprieve was sent, and,\r\nsix weeks afterwards, he was ordered for transportation. Whether Wesley\r\nassisted in obtaining the commutation of his sentence we have no means\r\nof knowing;[342] but as soon as the affair was settled he returned\r\nto Bristol; where, with the exception of a brief interval of about a\r\nweek’s duration, he continued until the month of June. The rest of the\r\nyear, excepting about three weeks, was spent in London.\r\n\r\nIn Bristol, the work, in its outward aspects, was greatly altered.\r\nWesley writes:—“Convictions sink deeper and deeper; love and joy are\r\nmore calm, even, and steady.”\r\n\r\nStill there were a few instances similar to those that had occurred\r\nin the previous year. On January 13, while he was administering the\r\nsacrament at the house of a sick person in Kingswood, a woman “sunk\r\ndown as dead.” A week after, she was “filled with the love of God,\r\nand with all peace and joy in believing.” On January 24, after he had\r\npreached in Bristol, another woman caught hold of him, crying:—“I\r\nhave sinned beyond forgiveness. I have been cursing you in my heart,\r\nand blaspheming God. I am damned; I know it; I feel it; I am in hell;\r\nI have hell in my heart.” On April 3, the congregations in Bristol\r\nwere remarkably visited; and “the cries of desire, joy, and love\r\nwere on every side.” Five weeks after, another phase of excitement\r\nwas presented. The people began to laugh; and, though it was a great\r\ngrief to them, the laughing spirit was stronger than they were able\r\nto resist. One woman, who was known to be no dissembler, “sometimes\r\nlaughed till she was almost strangled; then she broke out into\r\ncursing and blaspheming; then stamped and struggled with incredible\r\nstrength, so that four or five could scarce hold her; then cried out,\r\n‘O eternity, eternity! O that I had no soul! O that I had never been\r\nborn!’ At last, she faintly called on Christ to help her,” and her\r\nexcitement ceased. Most of the society were convinced, that those\r\nwho laughed had no power to help it; but there were two exceptions:\r\nElizabeth B—— and Anne H——. At length, says Wesley, “God suffered\r\nSatan to teach them better. Both of them were suddenly seized in the\r\nsame manner as the rest, and laughed whether they would or no, almost\r\nwithout ceasing. Thus they continued for two days, a spectacle to all;\r\nand were then, upon prayer made for them, delivered in a moment.”\r\n\r\nWhat are we to think of this? Wesley attributes it to Satan, and, in\r\nconfirmation of his opinion, recites an instance which had occurred in\r\nhis own history while at Oxford. According to their custom on Sundays,\r\nhe and his brother Charles were walking in the meadows, singing psalms,\r\nwhen all at once Charles burst into a loud fit of laughter. Wesley\r\nwrites:—“I asked him if he was distracted; and began to be angry.\r\nBut presently I began to laugh as loud as he; nor could we possibly\r\nrefrain, though we were ready to tear ourselves in pieces. We were\r\nforced to go home without singing another line.”\r\n\r\nAmidst all this, however, there were happy deaths at Bristol. Margaret\r\nThomas died in the highest triumph of faith, her will swallowed up in\r\nthe will of God, and her hope full of immortality.[343] And one of the\r\nKingswood converts “longed to be dissolved and to be with Christ;” some\r\nof her last words being, “I know His arms are round me; for His arms\r\nare like the rainbow, they go round heaven and earth.” These were among\r\nthe first Methodists that entered heaven; and, no doubt, it was deaths\r\nlike theirs which prompted not a few of the triumphant funereal hymns\r\nthat gushed so exultingly from the poetic soul of Wesley’s brother.\r\n\r\nThe New Room at Bristol, as the first Methodist meeting-house was\r\ncalled, was now opened. Wesley expounded and preached daily, choosing\r\nfor exposition the Acts of the Apostles, and for sermons the greatest\r\ntexts of the New Testament. He was also one of the most active of\r\nphilanthropists. The severity of the frost in January threw hundreds\r\nout of work, and reduced them to a state bordering on starvation; but\r\nWesley made collections, and fed a hundred, and sometimes a hundred\r\nand fifty, hungry wretches in a day. He visited Bristol Bridewell, and\r\ntried to benefit and to comfort poor prisoners, till the commanding\r\nofficer gave strict orders that neither Wesley nor any of his followers\r\nshould in future be admitted, because he and they were all atheists.\r\nOf these same Bristol “atheists,” Wesley himself writes, “They were\r\nindeed as little children, not artful, not wise in their own eyes, not\r\ndoting on controversy and strife of words; but truly determined to know\r\nnothing save Jesus Christ, and Him crucified.” Such they were when\r\nWesley left them at the beginning of the month of June; and such his\r\nbrother found them. “O what simplicity,” remarks Charles Wesley, “is in\r\nthis childlike people! O that our London brethren would come to school\r\nat Kingswood! These _are_ what they _pretend_ to be. God knows their\r\npoverty; but they are rich.”[344]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately broils generally broke out where Charles was pastor.\r\nThis was his affliction, if not his fault. Before June was ended, he\r\nbegan to “rebuke sharply” some who thought themselves elect. He also\r\nread his journal to the bands “as an antidote to stillness.” When\r\nsome of the people cried out, he “bade them to be quiet.” He reproved\r\nHannah Barrow before the assembled society at Kingswood; and exercised\r\ndiscipline upon others. All this might be proper and expedient; but it\r\nwas evidently of little use; for, when his brother returned to Bristol\r\non September 1, his first sermon was addressed to backsliders. He met\r\nwith one who had become wise far above what is written; and another who\r\nhad been lifted up with the abundance of joy God had given her, and\r\nhad fallen into blasphemies and vain imaginations. Later in the year,\r\nhe found many “lame and turned out of the way.” There were “jealousies\r\nand misunderstandings.” There had been a Kingswood riot, on account\r\nof the dearness of corn. Charles Wesley rushed into the midst of it,\r\nand, finding a number of his converted colliers, who had been forced to\r\njoin the disturbers of the public peace, he “gleaned a few from every\r\ncompany,” and “marched with them singing to the school,” where they\r\nheld a two hours’ prayer-meeting, that God would chain the lion. He\r\nhad to warn the people against apostasy. Some could not refrain from\r\nrailing. John Cennick, in December, told Wesley that he was not able\r\nto agree with him, because he failed to preach the truth respecting\r\nelection. The predestinarians formed themselves into a party, “to\r\nhave a church within themselves, and to give themselves the sacrament\r\nin bread and water.”[345] So that when Wesley, on December 26, went to\r\nKingswood, in order to preach at the usual hour, there was not more\r\nthan half-a-dozen of the Kingswood people to hear him, all the others\r\nhaving become the followers of Calvinistic Cennick.\r\n\r\nThere were other troubles in Bristol, in 1740. After several\r\ndisturbances in the month of March, the mob, on the 1st of April,\r\nfilled the street and court and alleys round the place where Wesley was\r\nexpounding, and shouted, cursed, and swore most fearfully. A number of\r\nthe rioters were arrested; and, within a fortnight, one of them had\r\nhanged himself; a second was seized with serious illness, and sent to\r\ndesire Wesley’s prayers; and a third came to him, confessing that he\r\nhad been hired and made drunk to create disturbance, but, on coming to\r\nthe place, found himself deprived of speech and power.\r\n\r\nConcurrent with this unpleasantness, other parties used their utmost\r\nendeavours to prejudice the mind of Howel Harris, gleaning up\r\nidle stories concerning Wesley, and retailing them in Wales. “And\r\nyet these,” says Wesley, “are good Christians! these whisperers,\r\ntalebearers, backbiters, evil speakers! Just such Christians as\r\nmurderers or adulterers!” The curate of Penreul averred, upon his\r\npersonal knowledge, that Wesley was a papist. Another man, a popish\r\npriest named Beon, while Wesley was preaching in Bristol, cried out,\r\n“Thou art a hypocrite, a devil, an enemy to the Church. This is\r\nfalse doctrine. It is not the doctrine of the Church. It is damnable\r\ndoctrine. It is the doctrine of devils.” At Upton, the bells were rung\r\nto drown his voice. At Temple church, the converted colliers, and even\r\nWesley’s brother Charles, were repelled from the sacramental table,\r\nand threatened with arrest. William Seward, the friend and travelling\r\ncompanion of George Whitefield, came to Bristol, and renounced the\r\nfriendship of the two Wesleys, “in bitter words of hatred;” and Mr.\r\nTucker preached against them, and condemned their irregularities in\r\nreforming and converting men.\r\n\r\nSo much respecting Bristol: let us turn to London. For the first five\r\nmonths, in 1740, Charles Wesley was the pastor of the London Moravians\r\nand Methodists, but conjoined with him was Philip Henry Molther, who\r\nwas the Moravian favourite.\r\n\r\nMolther was a native of Alsace, and a divinity student in the\r\nuniversity of Jena. In 1737, he became the private tutor of\r\nZinzendorf’s only son, and instructed him in French and music. On\r\nthe 18th of October, 1739, he arrived in London, on his way to\r\nPennsylvania. Bohler had left England; and the society in Fetter Lane\r\nwas under the care of the two Wesleys.[346] Being an ordained Moravian\r\nminister, the people were anxious to hear Molther preach. At first, he\r\nspoke to them in Latin, with the help of an interpreter; but shortly\r\nwas able to make himself understood in English. He was not satisfied\r\nwith the Fetter Lane Moravians, for, says he, they had “adopted many\r\nmost extraordinary usages.” The first time he entered their meeting, he\r\nwas alarmed and almost terror stricken at “their sighing and groaning,\r\ntheir whining and howling, which strange proceeding they called the\r\ndemonstration of the Spirit of power.” Molther, however, soon became\r\nextremely popular. Not only was the meeting-house in Fetter Lane filled\r\nwith hearers, but the courtyard as well. Within a fortnight after his\r\narrival, Wesley came from Bristol, “and the first person he met with\r\nwas one whom he had left strong in faith, and zealous of good works;\r\nbut who now told him, that Molther had fully convinced her she never\r\nhad any faith at all, and had advised her, till she received faith, to\r\nbe still, ceasing from outward works.” This was on November 1; and what\r\nfollowed, to the end of 1739, has been related already.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1740, Molther requested Wesley to furnish him with a\r\ntranslation of a German hymn; and the magnificent one beginning, “Now I\r\nhave found the ground wherein,” was the result. For this, Molther, in a\r\nletter dated January 25, 1740, thanks the translator, and says, “I like\r\nit better than any other hymn I have seen in English.” He then adds:—\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR BROTHER,—I love you with a real love in the wounds of\r\n    my Redeemer; and whenever I remember England, and the labourers\r\n    in the kingdom of our Saviour therein, you come in my mind; and\r\n    I can but pray our Lord, that He may open to you the hidden\r\n    treasures of the mysteries of the gospel, which, as I have seen\r\n    by two of your discourses, you want to know and to experience\r\n    a little more in its depths. It is a blessed thing to preach\r\n    out of that fulness, and by experimental notions of the blood\r\n    of Christ. If you seek for this as an empty, poor sinner, it\r\n    undoubtedly will be given you, because it is only for such; and\r\n    when we cannot reach it with our desires, we may surely believe\r\n    that our hearts are not empty vessels. This is a very great and\r\n    important thing, and a mystery as well as all other things,\r\n    unless the Lord hath revealed them unto us. I wish that our\r\n    Saviour, for His own sake, may give you an entire satisfaction\r\n    in this matter, and fill up your heart with a solid knowledge\r\n    of His bloody atonement. My love to your brother Charles and\r\n    all your brethren. I am your affectionate and unworthy brother,\r\n\r\n    “P. H. MOLTHER.”[347]\r\n\r\nFrom this vague and misty epistle, it is evident that the views of\r\nMolther were not entertained by Wesley. For this we are thankful. Who\r\ncan tell what is meant by loving a man “in the wounds of the Redeemer”?\r\nand by having the heart filled “up with a solid knowledge of His bloody\r\natonement”? With all his imperfections, Wesley had learned to express\r\nhis ideas in language much preferable to this.\r\n\r\nMolther remained in the metropolis till about September, 1740, when,\r\ninstead of proceeding to Pennsylvania as he intended, he was recalled\r\nto Germany. During this ten months‘residence, his diligence was\r\nexemplary, but its results disastrous. In the daytime, he visited from\r\nhouse to house. At nights, he met the bands, and often preached. James\r\nHutton, in a letter to Zinzendorf, dated March 14, 1740, writes:—\r\n\r\n    “MOST BELOVED BISHOP AND BROTHER,—\r\n\r\n    “My heart is poor, and I feel continually, that the blood of\r\n    Christ will be a great gift, when I can obtain it to overstream\r\n    my heart.\r\n\r\n    “At London, Molther preaches four times a week in English to\r\n    great numbers; and, from morning till night, he is engaged in\r\n    conversing with the souls, and labouring to bring them into\r\n    better order. They get a great confidence towards him, and many\r\n    of them began to be in great sorrow when they expected him to\r\n    be about to go away. I humbly beg you would leave him with\r\n    us, some time longer at the least. He continues very simple,\r\n    and improves exceedingly in the English language. The souls\r\n    are exceedingly thirsty, and hang on his words. He has had\r\n    many blessings. The false foundation many had made has been\r\n    discovered, and now speedily the one only foundation, Christ\r\n    Jesus, will be laid in many souls.\r\n\r\n    “John Wesley, being resolved to _do_ all things himself, and\r\n    having told many souls that they were justified, who have since\r\n    discovered themselves to be otherwise, and having mixed the\r\n    works of the law with the gospel as _means_ of grace, is at\r\n    enmity against the Brethren. Envy is not extinct in him. His\r\n    heroes falling every day almost into poor sinners, frightens\r\n    him; but, at London, the spirit of the Brethren prevails\r\n    against him. In a conference lately, where he was speaking\r\n    that souls ought to go to church as often as they could, I\r\n    besought him to be easy and not disturb himself, and I would\r\n    go to church as often as he would meet me there; but he would\r\n    not insist on it. He seeks occasion against the Brethren, but\r\n    I hope he will find none in us. I desired him simply to keep\r\n    to his office in the body of Christ, _i.e._ to awaken souls in\r\n    preaching, but not to pretend to lead them to Christ. But he\r\n    will have the glory of doing all things. I fear, by-and-by, he\r\n    will be an open enemy of Christ and His church. His brother\r\n    Charles is coming to London, determined to oppose all such as\r\n    shall not use the means of grace, after his sense of them. I\r\n    am determined to be still. I will let our Saviour govern this\r\n    whirlwind. Both John Wesley and Charles are dangerous snares to\r\n    many young women. Several are in love with them. I wish they\r\n    were married to some good sisters; though I would not give them\r\n    one of mine, even if I had many.\r\n\r\n    “In Yorkshire, Ingham and W. Delamotte are united to the\r\n    Brethren. Some thousand souls are awakened. They are a very\r\n    simple people. Some months will be necessary to bring them into\r\n    order, and Toltschig will not hurry as we Englishmen do.\r\n\r\n    “At Oxford, some good souls at first could not be reconciled\r\n    with lay teaching, stillness, etc.; but now some will come to\r\n    Christ. About six are in a fine way. Fifty, or thereabouts,\r\n    come to hear Viney three times a week, and he gets their hearts\r\n    more and more. He is poor in spirit, and gradually returns to\r\n    first principles.\r\n\r\n    “At Bristol, the souls are wholly under C. Wesley, who leads\r\n    them into many things, which they will find a difficulty\r\n    to come out of; for, at present, I believe, it will not be\r\n    possible to help them. First their leader must feel his heart,\r\n    or the souls must find him out.\r\n\r\n    “In Wales, some thousands are stirred up. They are an\r\n    exceedingly simple and honest people, but they are taught the\r\n    Calvinistic scheme. However, the young man, Howel Harris, who\r\n    has been the great instrument in this work, is very teachable\r\n    and humble, and loves the Brethren.\r\n\r\n    “My father and mother are in the same state, or rather in a\r\n    worse. My sister is much worse than ever. But, when grace can\r\n    be received, they will be blessed instruments, and bring great\r\n    glory to Him in whose heart’s blood I desire to be washed.\r\n\r\n    “I am your poor, yet loving brother, and the congregation’s\r\n    child,\r\n\r\n    “JAMES HUTTON.”[348]\r\n\r\nThis is a long, loose letter; but important, as descriptive of the\r\nWesleys and of the work of God in general, from the standpoint of the\r\nMoravians. They evidently thought themselves the prime, if not the\r\nonly, instruments in the present great revival; and this, excepting\r\nScotland, Wales, and Bristol, to a great extent, was true. The work\r\nthey had already done and contemplated was marvellous. A curious\r\nletter, dated December, 1739, is published in Doddridge’s Diary and\r\nCorrespondence, vol. iii., p. 265, in which Zinzendorf addresses\r\nDoddridge as “the very reverend man, much beloved in the bowels of the\r\nblessed Redeemer, pastor of Northampton, and vigilant theologian.”\r\nRecounting the triumphs of the gospel, he tells the Northampton pastor\r\nthat Switzerland has heard the truth; Greenland resounds with the\r\ngospel; thirty Caffrarians had been baptized; and a thousand negroes in\r\nthe West Indies. Savannah, the Carolinas, Pennsylvania, Berbice, and\r\nSurinam were expecting fruit; ten or fifteen heathen tribes in Virginia\r\nwere about to be visited; Ceylon and Lapland had both been reached;\r\nthe gospel was being preached in Russia; Wallachia was succoured;\r\nConstantinople was blessed; through the whole of Germany the churches\r\nwere preparing for Christ; and the Brethren were about to go to the\r\nEast Indies, to Persian Magi, and to New York savages. All this had\r\nbeen done within the last twenty years. The Moravians, like a hive of\r\nbees, were all workers. By the grace of God, they had accomplished\r\nwonders; and yet, in London at least, through false teaching, they\r\nwere in danger of being wrecked. The Wesleys tried to keep them right;\r\nbut, in doing so, incurred censure instead of receiving thanks. A long\r\nextract from one of James Hutton’s letters has just been given; and\r\nanother must be added. He writes:—\r\n\r\n    “John Wesley, displeased at not being thought so much of as\r\n    formerly, and offended with the easy way of salvation as\r\n    taught by the Brethren, publicly spoke against our doctrines\r\n    in his sermons, and his friends did the same. In June, 1740,\r\n    he formed his Foundery society, in opposition to the one which\r\n    met at Fetter Lane, and which had become a Moravian society.\r\n    Many of our usual hearers consequently left us, especially\r\n    the females. We asked his forgiveness, if in anything we had\r\n    aggrieved him, but he continued full of wrath, accusing the\r\n    Brethren that they, by dwelling exclusively on the doctrine\r\n    of faith, neglected the law, and zeal for sanctification. In\r\n    short, he became our declared opponent, and the two societies\r\n    of the Brethren and Methodists thenceforward were separated,\r\n    and became independent of each other.”[349]\r\n\r\nThis is a painful subject; and hitherto, by both Moravian and Methodist\r\nhistorians, has been touched with a tender hand; but men have a right\r\nto know the foibles and follies of the good and great, as well as\r\nthe virtues and victories for which they have been wreathed with\r\nhonour. Besides, the recent publication of the memoirs of James Hutton\r\nrenders it requisite that something more should be said respecting the\r\nsquabbles of 1740.\r\n\r\nIn the extracts just given, Hutton accuses Wesley of telling men that\r\nthey were justified when they were not; of envy; of being at enmity\r\nagainst the Moravians; of being able to awaken sinners, but not to lead\r\nthem to the Saviour; of being a dangerous snare to young females; and\r\nof being displeased at the decline of his popularity, and offended with\r\nthe Brethren’s easy method of salvation. Is all this true? Let us see.\r\nThe Moravian statements have been given with the utmost honesty; let\r\nthe reader take the Methodist statements on the other side.\r\n\r\nBe it borne in mind, that Wesley was one of the original members of\r\nthe Fetter Lane society, founded on the 1st of May, 1738; whereas\r\nMolther was first introduced among them in the month of October, 1739.\r\nUneasiness and cavils sprung up immediately after Molther’s arrival;\r\nand, before the year was ended, Wesley had to come twice from Bristol\r\nto try to check germinating evils, and to put wrong things right.\r\n\r\nOn New Year’s day, 1740, he writes: “I endeavoured to explain to\r\nour brethren the true, Christian, scriptural stillness, by largely\r\nunfolding these words, ‘Be still, and know that I am God.’” The day\r\nafter, he “earnestly besought them to ‘stand in the old paths.’ They\r\nall seemed convinced, and cried to God to heal their backslidings.”\r\nWesley adds: “He sent forth such a spirit of peace and love, as we had\r\nnot known for many months before.” Next day, January 3, Wesley set out\r\nfor Bristol, and returned a month afterwards. He now found his old\r\nfriends pleading for “a reservedness and closeness of conversation,”\r\nwhich perplexed him. He was told that “many of them, not content\r\nwith leaving off the ordinances of God themselves, were continually\r\ntroubling those that did not, and disputing with them, whether they\r\nwould or no.” He “expostulated with them, and besought them to refrain\r\nfrom perplexing the minds of those who still waited for God in the ways\r\nof His own appointment.”\r\n\r\nThus he left them on the 3rd of March. Meanwhile, “poor perverted\r\nMr. Simpson” declared to Charles Wesley, that no good was to be\r\ngot by what he called the _means of grace_, neither was there any\r\nobligation to use them; and that most of the Brethren had cast them\r\noff. Charles, accompanied by Thomas Maxfield, called on Molther, who\r\ntalked “against running after ordinances. They parted as they met,\r\nwithout prayer or singing; for the time for such exercises was past.”\r\nMaxfield was scandalized, and Charles Wesley foresaw that a separation\r\nwas unavoidable. On Easter day, when preaching at the Foundery, he\r\nappealed to the society, and asked, “Who hath bewitched you, that\r\nyou should let go your Saviour, and deny you ever knew Him?” A burst\r\nof sorrow followed; but, on going to Mr. Bowers’, in the evening, to\r\nmeet the bands, the door was shut against him; and proceeding to Mr.\r\nBray’s, the brazier, he was threatened with expulsion from the Moravian\r\nsociety. The day after, at Fetter Lane, Simpson reproved him for\r\nmentioning himself in preaching, and for preaching up the ordinances.\r\nHe answered, that he should not ask him, or any of the Brethren, how\r\nan ambassador of Christ should preach. He adds: “I went home, weary,\r\nwounded, bruised, and faint, through the contradiction of sinners;\r\n_poor_ sinners, as they call themselves,—these heady, violent, fierce\r\ncontenders for stillness. I could not bear the thought of meeting them\r\nagain.” Simpson said, “‘No soul _can_ be washed in the blood of Christ,\r\nunless it first be brought to one in whom Christ is fully formed. But\r\nthere are only _two such ministers_ in London, Bell and Molther.’\r\nIs not this robbing Christ of His glory, and making His creature\r\n_necessary_ to Him in His peculiar work of salvation? First perish\r\nMolther, Bell, and all mankind, and sink into nothing, that Christ may\r\nbe all in all. A new commandment, called ‘_stillness_,’ has repealed\r\nall God’s commandments, and given a full indulgence to corrupted\r\nnature. The _still_ ones rage against _me_; for my brother, they _say_,\r\nhad consented to their pulling down the ordinances, and here come I,\r\nand build them up again.”\r\n\r\nDuring the week, Simpson called upon Charles Wesley, and “laid down\r\nhis two postulatums:—1. The ordinances are not commands. 2. It is\r\nimpossible to doubt after justification.” In a society meeting, at\r\nthe Foundery, he further stated that “no unjustified person ought\r\nto receive the sacrament; for, doing so, he ate and drank his own\r\ndamnation;” and J. Bray declared, that it was “impossible for any one\r\nto be a true Christian out of the Moravian church.”\r\n\r\nSimpson wrote to Wesley wishing him to return to London; and, on\r\nApril 23, he came, and found confusion worse confounded than ever.\r\n“Believers,” said Simpson, “are not subject to ordinances; and\r\nunbelievers have nothing to do with them. They ought to be still;\r\notherwise they will be unbelievers as long as they live.” Wesley\r\nwrites: “After a fruitless dispute of about two hours, I returned home\r\nwith a heavy heart. In the evening, our society met; but it was cold,\r\nweary, heartless, dead. I found nothing of brotherly love among them\r\nnow; but a harsh, dry, heavy, stupid spirit. For two hours, they looked\r\none at another, when they looked up at all, as if one half of them was\r\nafraid of the other.” “The first hour passed in dumb show; the next in\r\ntrifles not worth naming.”[350]\r\n\r\nThe two Wesleys went to Molther, who explicitly affirmed, that no one\r\nhas any faith while he has any doubt; and that none are justified till\r\nthey are sanctified. He also maintained, that, until men obtain clean\r\nhearts and are justified, they must refrain from using the means of\r\ngrace, so called; but, after that, they are at perfect liberty to use\r\nthem, or to use them not, as they deem expedient. They are _designed\r\nonly_ for believers; but are not _enjoined_ even upon them.\r\n\r\nWesley was at his wits’ end; numbers came to him every day, once full\r\nof peace and love, but now plunged into doubts and fears. Just at this\r\njuncture, his brother printed his fine hymn, of twenty-three stanzas,\r\nentitled “The Means of Grace,” and circulated it “as an antidote to\r\nstillness.”[351] “Many,” said Charles, “insist that a part of their\r\nChristian calling is liberty _from_ obeying, not liberty _to_ obey.\r\n‘The unjustified,’ say they, ‘are _to be still_; that is, not to search\r\nthe Scriptures, not to pray, not to communicate, not to do good, not to\r\nendeavour, not to desire; for it is impossible to use means, without\r\ntrusting in them.’ Their practice is agreeable to their principles.\r\nLazy and proud themselves, bitter and censorious towards others, they\r\ntrample upon the ordinances, and despise the commands of Christ.”\r\n\r\nWesley preached from the text, “Thou fool, that which thou sowest is\r\nnot quickened, except it die;” and “demonstrated to the society, that\r\nthe ordinances are both means of grace, and commands of God.”[352]\r\nIt was also probably at this period that he preached his able and\r\ndiscriminating sermon on the same subject, and which is published in\r\nhis collected works. He specifies as the chief _means of grace_:—1.\r\nPrayer. 2. Searching the Scriptures; which implies reading, hearing,\r\nand meditating thereon. 3. Receiving the Lord’s supper. He allows,\r\nhowever, that, if these _means_ are used as a kind of _commutation_\r\nfor the religion they were designed to serve, it is difficult to find\r\nwords to express the enormous folly and wickedness of thus keeping\r\nChristianity out of the heart by the very means which were ordained to\r\nbring it in. All outward means whatever, if separate from the Spirit\r\nof God, cannot profit the man using them. They possess no intrinsic\r\npower; and God is equally able to work by any, or by none at all.\r\nWesley then proceeds to prove from Scripture, that, “all who desire the\r\ngrace of God are to wait for it in the means which He hath ordained;\r\nin using, not in laying them aside.” He likewise answers the following\r\nobjections:—1. You cannot use these means without _trusting_ in them.\r\n2. This is seeking salvation by works. 3. Christ is the only means of\r\ngrace. 4. The Scripture directs us to _wait_ for salvation. 5. God has\r\nappointed another way—“Stand _still_, and see the salvation of God.”\r\nFinally, Wesley concludes thus:—“1. Retain a lively sense that God\r\nis above all means, and can convey His grace, either in or out of any\r\nof the means which He hath appointed. 2. Be deeply impressed with the\r\nfact, that there is no _power nor merit_ in any of the means. The _opus\r\noperatum_, the mere work done, profiteth nothing. Do it because God\r\nbids it. 3. In and through every outward thing, seek God alone, looking\r\nsingly to the _power_ of His Spirit, and the _merits_ of His Son.”\r\nThe whole sermon is intensely _Wesleyan_; full of keenly defined and\r\npowerfully enforced Scripture truths. Let the reader read it: it will\r\nbenefit both his head and heart; and, perused in the light of these\r\npainful facts, it possesses historic interest of great importance. Such\r\na sermon must have had a powerful influence at such a time, and bold\r\nwas the man, who, in the midst of such disputers, had the fidelity to\r\npreach it.\r\n\r\nIt was a time of great anxiety. The work in London was in danger of\r\nbeing wrecked; and, more than that, some of Wesley’s oldest and most\r\ntrusted friends, in this afflictive emergency, proved unfaithful.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. George Stonehouse, vicar of Islington, was converted in 1738,\r\nchiefly through the instrumentality of Charles Wesley, who, for a time,\r\nofficiated as his curate. Many were the warm-hearted meetings, held,\r\nby the first Methodists, in the vicar’s house. His affection for the\r\ntwo Wesleys was great; and, in November 1738, when they were forsaken\r\nby all their friends, and well-nigh penniless, he offered to find\r\nthem home and maintenance; and yet, six months afterwards, he yielded\r\nto his churchwardens, and allowed Charles Wesley to be excluded from\r\nhis church. Imbibing Molther’s heresies, Stonehouse sold his living,\r\nmarried the only daughter of Sir John Crispe, joined the Moravians,\r\nand retired to Sherborne, in the west of England, where he fitted up a\r\nplace capable of accommodating five hundred people, in which to hold\r\nMoravian meetings. In 1745, he had a lovefeast, the room being grandly\r\nilluminated with thirty-seven candles adorned with flowers; and all the\r\nsisters present being dressed in German fashion. Shortly after this, he\r\nabandoned the Brethren altogether,[353] and appears henceforth to have\r\nspent his days in inglorious _stillness_, enjoying the benefits of a\r\n_quiet_ religion and a harmless life.[354]\r\n\r\nWesley sought counsel of his friend Ingham, and received in reply the\r\nfollowing letter, full of piety and mistiness, and now for the first\r\ntime published.\r\n\r\n    “OSSET, _February 20, 1740_.\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR BROTHER,—You ask, what are the marks of a person that\r\n    is justified, but not sealed?\r\n\r\n    “I cannot give you any certain, infallible marks. One to whom\r\n    the Lord has given the gift of discerning could tell; but\r\n    without that gift none else can know surely. However, it may be\r\n    said, that justified persons are meek, simple, and childlike;\r\n    they have doubts and fears; they are in a wilderness state;\r\n    and, in this state, they are to be kept _still and quiet_, to\r\n    search more deeply into their hearts, so that they may become\r\n    more and more humble. They are likewise to depend wholly upon\r\n    Christ; and to be kept from confusion; for, if they come into\r\n    confusion, they receive inconceivable damage.\r\n\r\n    “On the other hand, if they continue meek, gentle, still,—if\r\n    they search into their hearts, and depend on Christ, they will\r\n    find their hearts to be sweetly drawn after Him; they will\r\n    begin to loathe and abhor sin, and to hunger and thirst after\r\n    righteousness; they will get strength daily; Christ will begin\r\n    to manifest Himself by degrees; the darkness will vanish, and\r\n    the day-star will arise in their hearts. Thus they will go on\r\n    from strength to strength, till they become strong; and then\r\n    they will begin to see things clearly; and so, by degrees, they\r\n    will come to have the assurance of faith.\r\n\r\n    “You ask whether, in this intermediate state, they are\r\n    ‘children of wrath,’ or ‘heirs of the promises’?\r\n\r\n    “Without doubt, they are children of God, and in a state\r\n    of salvation. A child may be heir to an estate, before it\r\n    can speak, or know what an estate is; so we may be heirs of\r\n    heaven before we know it, or are made sure of it. However, the\r\n    assurance of faith is to be sought after. It may be attained;\r\n    and it will be, by all who go forward.\r\n\r\n    “We must first be deeply humble and poor in spirit. We must\r\n    have a fixed and abiding sense of our own weakness and\r\n    unworthiness, corruption, sin, and misery. This it is to be a\r\n    _poor sinner_.\r\n\r\n    “If I were with you, I would explain things more largely; but I\r\n    am a novice; I am but a beginner; a babe in Christ. If you go\r\n    amongst the Brethren, they are good guides; but, after all, we\r\n    must be taught of God, and have experience in our own hearts.\r\n    May the Spirit of truth lead us into all truth!\r\n\r\n    “I am your poor, unworthy brother,\r\n\r\n    “B. INGHAM.\r\n\r\n    “Rev. John Wesley, at Mr. Bray’s, Brazier,\r\n    in Little Britain, London.”\r\n\r\nThis is a curious letter, and will help to cast light on some of\r\nthe expressions which Wesley himself had used concerning his own\r\nexperience. As yet, the Methodists had much to learn. Meanwhile, Ingham\r\nand Howel Harris came to London. Charles Wesley says, the latter, in\r\nhis preaching, proved himself a son of thunder and of consolation.\r\nCavilling, however, followed. Honest, plain, undesigning James Hutton\r\n“was all tergiversation, and turned into a subtle, close, ambiguous\r\nLoyola;” while Richard Bell, watch-case maker, seemed to think, that he\r\nand Molther and another were all the church that Christ had in England.\r\nA man of the name of Ridley rendered himself famous by saying, “You\r\nmay as well go to hell for praying as for thieving;” and John Browne\r\nasserted, “If we read, the devil reads with us; if we pray, he prays\r\nwith us; if we go to church or sacrament, he goes with us.”[355]\r\n\r\nIngham also, as well as Harris, “honestly withstood the deluded\r\nBrethren; contradicted their favourite errors; and constrained them to\r\nbe _still_.” In the Fetter Lane society, he bore a noble testimony for\r\nthe ordinances of God; but the answer was, “You are blind, and speak\r\nof the things you know not.” Wesley preached a series of sermons—1.\r\nOn the delusion, that “weak faith is no faith.” 2. On the bold\r\naffirmation, that there is but one commandment in the New Testament,\r\nnamely, “to believe.” 3. On the point, that Christians are subject to\r\nthe ordinances of Christ. 4. On the fact, that a man may be justified\r\nwithout being entirely sanctified. These discourses were followed by\r\nfive others, on reading the Scriptures, prayer, the Lord’s supper, and\r\ngood works.\r\n\r\nThe result was increased commotion. Some said, “We believers are no\r\nmore bound to obey, than the subjects of the king of England are bound\r\nto obey the laws of the king of France.” Bell declared that, for a\r\nman not born of God to read the Scriptures, pray, or come to the\r\nLord’s table, was deadly poison. And Wesley, after a short debate, was\r\nprohibited preaching at Fetter Lane.\r\n\r\nThis brought matters to a crisis. Wesley had done all he could to\r\ncorrect the growing errors; but Molther was a greater favourite than\r\nWesley; and the man, who had founded Fetter Lane society, was now, by\r\nMoravian votes, commanded to go about his business, and to leave the\r\npulpit to his German superiors.\r\n\r\nThe thing had become an intolerable evil; and, at all hazards, the\r\nheresies must be checked. Substantially they may be reduced to two:—1.\r\nThat there are no degrees of faith; or, in other words, that there is\r\nno justifying faith where there is any doubt or fear; or, in other\r\nwords (for we feel it difficult to gripe such an abortive dogma),\r\nno man believes and is justified, unless, in the full sense of the\r\nexpression, he is sanctified, and is possessed of a clean heart. 2.\r\nThat to search the Scriptures, to pray, or to communicate, before we\r\nhave faith, is to seek salvation by works; and such works must be laid\r\naside before faith can be received.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to confute such errors. Suffice it to say, that,\r\nbefore half-a-dozen years had passed, the London Moravians dropped the\r\nvery doctrines, for opposing which Wesley was expelled from preaching\r\nin Fetter Lane. Their _stillness_ was declared to mean, that “man\r\ncannot attain to salvation by his own wisdom, strength, righteousness,\r\ngoodness, merits, or works. When he applies for it, he must cast away\r\nall dependence upon everything of his own, and, trusting only to the\r\nmercy of God, through the merits of Christ, he must thus _quietly wait_\r\nfor God’s salvation.”[356] This is a doctrine to which Wesley raised\r\nno objection; but it was not the doctrine of Molther, Browne, Bell,\r\nBray, and Bowers, in 1740. Then as to the doctrine concerning degrees\r\nin faith, it is right to add, that such a dogma was never taught by\r\nthe general authorities of the Moravian _church_; but it was taught by\r\nSpangenberg, Molther, Stonehouse, and other Moravians in London,[357]\r\nthe result being the disastrous confusion to which we are now\r\nadverting. Indeed, it is a notable fact, that, only two months after\r\nthe Fetter Lane disruption, Wesley himself clears the Moravian _church_\r\nfrom the aspersion, that it held such heresies. They were the spawn of\r\nfoolish fanatics, who regarded themselves Moravians, but were hardly\r\nworthy of the name. On September 29, 1740, Wesley having stated what\r\nthe errors were, observes:—“In flat opposition to this, I assert: 1.\r\nThat a man may have a degree of justifying faith, before he is wholly\r\nfreed from all doubt and fear; and before he has, in the full, proper\r\nsense, a new, a clean heart. 2. That a man may use the ordinances of\r\nGod, the Lord’s supper in particular, before he has such a faith as\r\nexcludes all doubt and fear, and implies a new, a clean heart. 3. I\r\nfurther assert, that I learned this, not only from the English, but\r\nalso from the Moravian church; and I hereby openly and earnestly call\r\nupon that church, and upon Count Zinzendorf in particular, to correct\r\nme, and explain themselves, if I have misunderstood or misrepresented\r\nthem.” Wesley thus puts the blame on the right shoulders. It was not\r\nthe Moravian _church_, but a few of its foolish ministers and members,\r\nat Fetter Lane, that circulated these heresies.\r\n\r\nWhat was the result? If the Fetter Lane society did not exclude Wesley\r\nfrom their membership, they, on the 16th of July, expelled him from\r\ntheir pulpit; and hence, four days afterwards, he went with Mr. Seward\r\nto their lovefeast, and, at its conclusion, read a paper stating the\r\nerrors into which they had fallen, and concluding thus:—“I believe\r\nthese assertions to be flatly contrary to the word of God. I have\r\nwarned you hereof again and again, and besought you to turn back to the\r\n‘law and the testimony.’ I have borne with you long, hoping you would\r\nturn. But, as I find you more and more confirmed in the error of your\r\nways, nothing now remains, but that I should give you up to God. You\r\nthat are of the same judgment, follow me.”\r\n\r\nWithout saying more, he then silently withdrew, eighteen or nineteen of\r\nthe society following him.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards, he received a letter from one of the Brethren in\r\nGermany, advising him and his brother to deliver up the “instruction\r\nof poor souls” to the Moravians; “for you,” adds the writer, “only\r\ninstruct them in such errors, that they will be damned at last. St.\r\nPeter justly describes you, who ‘have eyes full of adultery, and cannot\r\ncease from sin;’ and take upon you to guide unstable souls, and lead\r\nthem in the way of damnation.”\r\n\r\nThe day following, the seceding society, numbering about twenty-five\r\nmen and fifty women, met for the first time, at the Foundery, instead\r\nof at Fetter Lane; and so the Methodist society was founded on July 23,\r\n1740.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, Wesley, “a presbyter of the church of God in\r\nEngland,” wrote a long letter “to the church of God at Herrnhuth,” in\r\nwhich he states, that, though some of the Moravians had pronounced him\r\n“a child of the devil and a servant of corruption,” yet, he was now\r\ntaking the liberty of speaking freely and plainly concerning things\r\nin the Moravian church which he deemed unscriptural. He enumerates\r\nthe heresies which have been so often mentioned. He tells them, that\r\na Moravian preacher, in his public expounding, said: “As many go to\r\nhell by praying as by thieving.” Another had said, “I knew a man who\r\nreceived a great gift while leaning over the back of a chair; but\r\nkneeling down to give God thanks, he lost it immediately through doing\r\nso.” He charges the Moravians with exalting themselves and despising\r\nothers, and declares, that he scarce ever heard a Moravian owning his\r\nchurch or himself to be wrong in anything. They spoke of their church\r\nas if it were infallible, and some of them set it up as the judge of\r\nall the earth, of all persons and of all doctrines, and maintained that\r\nthere were no true Christians out of it. Like the modern Mystics, they\r\nmixed much of man’s wisdom with the wisdom of God, and philosophised on\r\nalmost every part of the plain religion of the Bible. They talked much\r\nagainst mixing nature with grace, and against mimicking the power of\r\nthe Holy Ghost. They cautioned the brethren against animal joy, against\r\nnatural love of one another, and against selfish love of God. “My\r\nbrethren,” concludes Wesley, “whether ye will hear, or whether ye will\r\nforbear, I have now delivered my own soul. And this I have chosen to do\r\nin an artless manner, that if anything should come home to your hearts,\r\nthe effect might evidently flow, not from the wisdom of man, but from\r\nthe power of God.”\r\n\r\nOn September 1, Charles Wesley wrote to Whitefield in America, as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n    “The great work goes forward, maugre all the opposition of\r\n    earth and hell. The most violent opposers of all are our\r\n    own brethren of Fetter Lane, that were. We have gathered up\r\n    between twenty and thirty from the wreck, and transplanted\r\n    them to the Foundery. The remnant has taken root downward,\r\n    and borne fruit upwards. A little one is become a thousand.\r\n    They grow in grace, particularly in humility, and in the\r\n    knowledge of our Lord Jesus. Innumerable have been the devices\r\n    to scatter this little flock. The roaring lion is turned a\r\n    _still_ lion, and makes havoc of the church by means of our\r\n    spiritual brethren. They are indefatigable in bringing us off\r\n    from our ‘carnal ordinances,’ and speak with such wisdom from\r\n    beneath, that, if it were possible, they would deceive the very\r\n    elect. The Quakers, they say, are exactly right; and, indeed,\r\n    the principles of the one naturally lead to the other. For\r\n    instance, take our poor friend Morgan. One week he and his wife\r\n    were at J. Bray’s, under the teaching of the _still_ brethren.\r\n    Soon after, he turned Quaker, and is now a celebrated preacher\r\n    among them. All these things shall be for the furtherance of\r\n    the gospel.”[358]\r\n\r\nWhitefield’s reply to this is unknown; but on November 24 he wrote as\r\nfollows to James Hutton:—\r\n\r\n    “I have lately conversed closely with Peter Bohler. Alas!\r\n    we differ widely in many respects; therefore, to avoid\r\n    disputations and jealousies on both sides, it is best to\r\n    carry on the work of God apart. The divisions among the\r\n    Brethren sometimes grieve, but do not surprise me. How can it\r\n    be otherwise, when teachers do not think and speak the same\r\n    things? God grant we may keep up a cordial, undissembled love\r\n    towards each other, notwithstanding our different opinions. O,\r\n    how I long for heaven! Surely, there will be no divisions, no\r\n    strife there, except who shall sing with most affection to the\r\n    Lamb that sitteth upon the throne. Dear James, there I hope to\r\n    meet thee.”[359]\r\n\r\nHere, for the present, we leave the London Moravians. We say, for the\r\npresent, for unfortunately we shall have to recur to them.\r\n\r\nThe year 1740 was a year of troubles. A month previous to the Fetter\r\nLane secession, a man of the name of Acourt bitterly complained, that\r\nhe had been refused admission to the society-meeting, by order of\r\nCharles Wesley, because he differed from the Wesleys in opinion. “What\r\nopinion do you mean?” asked Wesley. He answered, “That of election. I\r\nhold, a certain number is elected from eternity; and these must and\r\nshall be saved; and the rest of mankind must and shall be damned; and\r\nmany of your society hold the same.” Here we have another bone of\r\ncontention.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of Whitefield’s visit to America, he and the Wesleys\r\nhad laboured in union and harmony, without entering into the discussion\r\nof particular opinions; but now, across the Atlantic, Whitefield\r\nbecame acquainted with a number of godly Calvinistic ministers, who\r\nrecommended to him the writings of the puritan divines, which he\r\nread with great avidity, and, as a consequence, soon embraced their\r\nsentiments. Secrecy was no part of Whitefield’s mental or moral nature.\r\nWith the utmost frankness, he wrote to Wesley, informing him of his new\r\nopinions.[360]\r\n\r\nWesley was the son of parents who held the doctrines of election and\r\nreprobation in abhorrence. While at college, he had thoroughly sifted\r\nthe subject for himself, and, in letters to his mother, expressed his\r\nviews in the strongest language. Whitefield, on the contrary, was no\r\ntheologian. His heart was one of the largest that ever throbbed in\r\nhuman bosom; but his logical faculties were small. When he read the\r\nCalvinistic theory, he was not conversant with the arguments against\r\nit; and hence, with his characteristic impulsiveness, he adopted\r\na creed, which far more powerful minds than his had not been able\r\nto defend. Southey remarks, with great truthfulness, that, “at the\r\ncommencement of his career, Wesley was of a pugnacious spirit, the\r\neffect of his sincerity, his ardour, and his confidence.” No wonder\r\nthen that these two devoted friends were soon at variance.\r\n\r\nOne of Whitefield’s letters, dated June 25, 1739, has been already\r\ngiven. The following is another, hitherto unpublished, written a week\r\nlater:—\r\n\r\n    “GLOUCESTER, _July 2, 1739_.\r\n\r\n    “HONOURED SIR,—I confess my spirit has been of late sharpened\r\n    on account of some of your proceedings; my heart has been quite\r\n    broken within me. I have been grieved from my soul, knowing\r\n    what a dilemma I am reduced to. How shall I tell the Dissenters\r\n    I do not approve of their doctrines, without wronging my\r\n    own soul? How shall I tell them I do, without contradicting\r\n    my honoured friend, whom I desire to love as my own soul?\r\n    Lord, for Thy infinite mercy’s sake, direct me so to act, as\r\n    neither to injure myself nor my friend! Is it true, honoured\r\n    sir, that brother Stock is excluded the society because he\r\n    holds predestination? If so, is it right? Would Jesus Christ\r\n    have done so? Is this to act with a catholic spirit? Is it\r\n    true, honoured sir, that the house at Kingswood is intended\r\n    hereafter for the brethren to dwell in, as at Herrnhuth? Is\r\n    this answering the primitive design of that building? Did the\r\n    Moravians live together till they were obliged by persecution?\r\n    Does the scheme at Islington succeed? As for brother Cennick’s\r\n    expounding, I know not what to say. Brother Watkin I think no\r\n    way qualified for any such thing.\r\n\r\n    “Dear, honoured sir, if you have any regard for the peace of\r\n    the church, keep in your sermon on predestination. But you have\r\n    cast a lot. Oh! my heart, in the midst of my body, is like\r\n    melted wax. The Lord direct us all! Honoured sir, indeed, I\r\n    desire you all the success you can wish for. May you increase,\r\n    though I decrease! I would willingly wash your feet. God is\r\n    with us mightily. I have just now written to the bishop. Oh,\r\n    wrestle, wrestle, honoured sir, in prayer, that not the least\r\n    alienation of affection may be between you, honoured sir, and\r\n    your obedient son and servant in Christ,\r\n\r\n    “GEORGE WHITEFIELD.\r\n\r\n    “To the Rev. Mr. John Wesley, at Mrs. Grevil’s,\r\n    a grocer, in Wine Street, Bristol.”\r\n\r\nThis was within three months from the time when Wesley, at Whitefield’s\r\nrequest, began his career of out-door preaching at Bristol. Two months\r\nlater, Whitefield was, a second time, on his way to America. Wesley\r\nwrote to him, opposing the doctrine of election, and also enforcing\r\nthe doctrine, that, though Christians can never be freed from “those\r\nnumberless weaknesses and follies, sometimes improperly termed sins of\r\ninfirmity,” yet it is the privilege of all to be saved “entirely from\r\nsin in its proper sense, and from committing it.”[361]\r\n\r\nIn reply, Whitefield wrote as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “SAVANNAH, _March 26, 1740_.\r\n\r\n    “MY HONOURED FRIEND AND BROTHER,—For once hearken to a\r\n    child, who is willing to wash your feet. I beseech you, by\r\n    the mercies of God in Christ Jesus our Lord, if you would\r\n    have my love confirmed towards you, write no more to me\r\n    about misrepresentations wherein we differ. To the best of\r\n    my knowledge, at present, no sin has _dominion_ over me; yet\r\n    I feel the strugglings of indwelling sin day by day. I can,\r\n    therefore, by no means, come into your interpretation of the\r\n    passage mentioned in your letter, and as explained in your\r\n    preface to Mr. Halyburton. If possible, I am ten thousand times\r\n    more convinced of the doctrine of _election_, and the _final_\r\n    perseverance of those that are truly in Christ, than when I\r\n    saw you last. You think otherwise. Why then should we dispute,\r\n    when there is no probability of convincing? Will it not, in\r\n    the end, destroy brotherly love, and insensibly take from us\r\n    that cordial union and sweetness of soul, which I pray God may\r\n    always subsist between us? How glad would the enemies of the\r\n    Lord be to see us divided! How many would rejoice, should I\r\n    join and make a party against you! How would the cause of our\r\n    common Master suffer by our raising disputes about particular\r\n    points of doctrines! _Honoured sir_, let us offer salvation\r\n    freely to all by the blood of Jesus; and whatever light God has\r\n    communicated to us, let us freely communicate to others. I have\r\n    lately read the life of Luther, and think it in nowise to his\r\n    honour, that the last part of his life was so much taken up in\r\n    disputing with Zuinglius and others, who, in all probability,\r\n    equally loved the Lord Jesus, notwithstanding they might differ\r\n    from him in other points. Let this, dear sir, be a caution to\r\n    us. I hope it will to me; for, provoke me to it as much as you\r\n    please, I intend not to enter the lists of controversy with\r\n    you on the points wherein we differ. Only, I pray to God, that\r\n    the more you _judge me_, the more I may _love you_, and learn\r\n    to desire no one’s approbation, but that of my Lord and Master\r\n    Jesus Christ.”[362]\r\n\r\nTwo months after this, Whitefield wrote again:—\r\n\r\n    “CAPE LOPEN, _May 24, 1740_.\r\n\r\n    “HONOURED SIR,—I cannot entertain prejudices against your\r\n    conduct and principles any longer, without informing you. The\r\n    more I examine the writings of the most experienced men, and\r\n    the experiences of the most established Christians, the more\r\n    I differ from your notion about not committing sin, and your\r\n    denying the doctrines of election and final perseverance of\r\n    the saints. I dread coming to England, unless you are resolved\r\n    to oppose these truths with less warmth than when I was there\r\n    last. I dread your coming over to America, because the work of\r\n    God is carried on here (and that in a most glorious manner),\r\n    by doctrines quite opposite to those you hold. Here are\r\n    thousands of God’s children, who will not be persuaded out of\r\n    the privileges purchased for them by the blood of Jesus. There\r\n    are many worthy experienced ministers, who would oppose your\r\n    principles to the utmost. God direct me what to do! Sometimes,\r\n    I think it best to stay here, where we all think and speak\r\n    the same thing. The work goes on without divisions, and with\r\n    more success, because all employed in it are of one mind. I\r\n    write not this, honoured sir, from heat of spirit, but out of\r\n    love. At present, I think you are entirely inconsistent with\r\n    yourself, and, therefore, do not blame me, if I do not approve\r\n    all you say. God Himself teaches my friends the doctrine of\r\n    election. Sister H—— hath lately been convinced of it; and,\r\n    if I mistake not, dear and honoured Mr. Wesley hereafter will\r\n    be convinced also. Perhaps I may never see you again, till we\r\n    meet in judgment; then, if not before, you will know, that\r\n    sovereign, distinguishing, irresistible grace brought you\r\n    to heaven. Then will you know, that God loved you with an\r\n    everlasting love; and therefore with lovingkindness did He draw\r\n    you. Honoured sir, farewell!”[363]\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, on the 7th of June, Whitefield, writing to James\r\nHutton, says:—\r\n\r\n    “For Christ’s sake, desire dear brother Wesley to avoid\r\n    disputing with me. I think I had rather die, than see a\r\n    division between us; and yet how can we walk together, if we\r\n    oppose each other?”[364]\r\n\r\nHe wrote again to Wesley as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “SAVANNAH, _June 25, 1740_.\r\n\r\n    “MY HONOURED FRIEND AND BROTHER,—For Christ’s sake, if\r\n    possible, never speak against election in your sermons. No\r\n    one can say, that I ever mentioned it in public discourses,\r\n    whatever my private sentiments may be. For Christ’s sake, let\r\n    us not be divided amongst ourselves. Nothing will so much\r\n    prevent a division as your being silent on this head. I am glad\r\n    to hear, that you speak up for an attendance on the means of\r\n    grace, and do not encourage persons who run, I am persuaded,\r\n    before they are called. The work of God will suffer by such\r\n    imprudence.”[365]\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of July, Howel Harris wrote to Wesley:—\r\n\r\n    “DEAR BROTHER JOHN,—Reports are circulated that you hold _no\r\n    faith_ without a full and constant assurance, and, that there\r\n    is no state of salvation without being wholly set at liberty\r\n    in the fullest sense of perfection. It is also said, that I\r\n    am carried away by the same stream, and, that many of the\r\n    little ones are afraid to come near me. Letters have likewise\r\n    informed me, that, the night you left London, you turned a\r\n    brother out of the society, and charged all to beware of him,\r\n    purely because he held the doctrine of election. My dear\r\n    brother, do not act in the stiff, uncharitable spirit which\r\n    you condemn in others. If you exclude him from the society and\r\n    from the fraternity of the Methodists, for such a cause, you\r\n    must exclude brother Whitefield, brother Seward, and myself. I\r\n    hope I shall contend with my last breath and blood, that it is\r\n    owing to special, distinguishing, and irresistible grace, that\r\n    those that are saved are saved. O that you would not touch on\r\n    this subject till God enlighten you! My dear brother, being a\r\n    public person, you grieve God’s people by your opposition to\r\n    electing love; and many poor souls believe your doctrine simply\r\n    because you hold it. All this arises from the prejudices of\r\n    your education, your books, your companions, and the remains of\r\n    your carnal reason. The more I write, the more I love you. I\r\n    am sure you are one of God’s elect, and, that you act honestly\r\n    according to the light you have.”[366]\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of August, Wesley addressed Whitefield as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR BROTHER,—I thank you for yours of May the 24th. The\r\n    case is quite plain. There are bigots both for predestination\r\n    and against it. God is sending a message to those on either\r\n    side. But neither will receive it, unless from one who is of\r\n    their own opinion. Therefore, for a time, you are suffered to\r\n    be of one opinion, and I of another. But when His time is come,\r\n    God will do what man cannot, namely, make us both of one mind.\r\n    Then persecution will flame out, and it will be seen whether we\r\n    count our lives dear unto ourselves, so that we may finish our\r\n    course with joy. I am, my dearest brother, ever yours,\r\n\r\n    “JOHN WESLEY.”[367]\r\n\r\nIn the same month, Whitefield wrote to Wesley:—\r\n\r\n    “CHARLESTOWN, _August 25, 1740_.\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR AND HONOURED SIR,—Give me leave, with all humility,\r\n    to exhort you not to be strenuous in opposing the doctrines of\r\n    election and final perseverance; when, by your own confession,\r\n    you have not the witness of the Spirit within yourself, and\r\n    consequently are not a proper judge. I remember brother E——\r\n    told me one day, that he was convinced of the perseverance of\r\n    saints. I told him, you were not. He replied, but ‘he will be\r\n    convinced when he has got the Spirit himself.’ Perhaps the\r\n    doctrines of election and of final perseverance have been\r\n    abused; but, notwithstanding, they are children’s bread, and\r\n    ought not to be withheld from them, supposing they are always\r\n    mentioned with proper cautions against the abuse of them. I\r\n    write not this to enter into disputation. I cannot bear the\r\n    thought of opposing you; but how can I avoid it, if you go\r\n    about, as your brother Charles once said, to drive John Calvin\r\n    out of Bristol. Alas! I never read anything that Calvin wrote.\r\n    My doctrines I had from Christ and His apostles. I was taught\r\n    them of God; and as God was pleased to send me out first, and\r\n    to enlighten me first, so, I think, He still continues to do\r\n    it. I find, there is a disputing among you about election and\r\n    perfection. I pray God to put a stop to it; for what good end\r\n    will it answer? I wish I knew your principles fully. If you\r\n    were to write oftener, and more frankly, it might have a better\r\n    effect than silence and reserve.”[368]\r\n\r\nA month later he wrote again as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “BOSTON, _September 25, 1740_.\r\n\r\n    “HONOURED SIR,—I am sorry to hear, by many letters, that you\r\n    seem to own a _sinless perfection_ in this life attainable. I\r\n    think I cannot answer you better, than a venerable minister\r\n    in these parts answered a Quaker: ‘Bring me a man that hath\r\n    really arrived to this, and I will pay his expenses, let him\r\n    come from where he will.’ I know not what you may think, but\r\n    I do not expect to say indwelling sin is destroyed in me,\r\n    till I bow my head and give up the ghost. There must be some\r\n    Amalekites left in the Israelites’ land to keep his soul in\r\n    action, to keep him humble, and to drive him continually to\r\n    Jesus Christ for pardon. I know many abuse this doctrine, and\r\n    perhaps wilfully indulge sin, or do not aspire after holiness,\r\n    because no man is perfect in this life. But what of that?\r\n    Must I assert, therefore, doctrines contrary to the gospel?\r\n    God forbid! Besides, dear sir, what a fond conceit is it to\r\n    cry up _perfection_, and yet cry down the doctrine of _final\r\n    perseverance_. But this, and many other absurdities, you will\r\n    run into, because you will not own _election_. And you will not\r\n    own _election_, because you cannot own it without believing the\r\n    doctrine of _reprobation_. What then is there in _reprobation_\r\n    so horrid? I see no blasphemy in holding that doctrine, if\r\n    rightly explained. If God might have passed by all, He may\r\n    pass by some. Judge whether it is not a greater blasphemy to\r\n    say, ‘Christ died for souls now in hell.’ Surely, dear sir,\r\n    you do not believe there will be a general gaol _delivery_ of\r\n    damned souls hereafter. O that you would study the covenant of\r\n    grace! But I have done. If you think so meanly of Bunyan and\r\n    the puritan writers, I do not wonder that you think me wrong. I\r\n    find your sermon has had its expected success. It has set the\r\n    nation a disputing. You will have enough to do now to answer\r\n    pamphlets. Two I have already seen. O that you would be more\r\n    cautious in casting lots! O that you would not be too rash and\r\n    precipitant! If you go on thus, honoured sir, how can I concur\r\n    with you? It is impossible. I must speak what I know. About\r\n    spring you may expect to see,\r\n\r\n    “Ever, ever yours in Christ,\r\n    “GEORGE WHITEFIELD.”[369]\r\n\r\nWesley’s sermon was already published. Let us look at it. It was\r\npreached at Bristol; and, in some respects, was the most important\r\nsermon that he ever issued. It led, as we shall shortly see, to the\r\ndivision which Whitefield so devoutly deprecates; and also to the\r\norganisation of Lady Huntingdon’s Connexion, and to the founding of the\r\nCalvinistic Methodists in Wales; and, finally, culminated in the fierce\r\ncontroversy of 1770, and the publication of Fletcher’s unequalled\r\n“Checks;” which so effectually silenced the Calvinian heresy, that its\r\nvoice has scarce been heard from that time to this. Viewed in such a\r\nlight, the difference between Wesley and Whitefield was really one of\r\nthe greatest events in the history of Wesley and even of the religion\r\nof the age.\r\n\r\nWesley’s sermon, entitled “Free Grace,” was founded upon Romans viii.\r\n32, and was printed as a 12mo pamphlet in twenty-four pages. Annexed\r\nto it was Charles Wesley’s remarkable “Hymn on Universal Redemption,”\r\nconsisting of thirty-six stanzas of four lines each.[370] It is also a\r\nnoteworthy fact, that, notwithstanding its importance, it was never\r\nincluded by Wesley in any collected edition of his sermons; and, in\r\nhis own edition of his works, it is placed among his controversial\r\nwritings. There is likewise a brief address to the reader, as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Nothing but the strongest conviction, not only that what is\r\n    here advanced is ‘the truth as it is in Jesus,’ but also that\r\n    I am indispensably obliged to declare this truth to all the\r\n    world, could have induced me openly to oppose the sentiments of\r\n    those whom I esteem for their works’ sake; at whose feet may I\r\n    be found in the day of the Lord Jesus!\r\n\r\n    “Should any believe it his duty to reply hereto, I have only\r\n    one request to make,—let whatsoever you do be done in charity,\r\n    in love, and in the spirit of meekness. Let your very disputing\r\n    show, that you have ‘put on, as the elect of God, bowels of\r\n    mercies, gentleness, longsuffering,’ that even according to\r\n    this time it may be said, ‘See how these Christians love one\r\n    another.’”\r\n\r\nHaving laid down the principle that God’s “free grace is free in all,\r\nand free for all,” Wesley proceeds, with great acuteness, to define the\r\ndoctrine of predestination; namely, “Free grace in all is not free for\r\nall, but only for those whom God hath ordained to life. The greater\r\npart of mankind God hath ordained to death; and it is not free for\r\nthem. Them God hateth; and therefore, before they were born, decreed\r\nthey should die eternally. And this He absolutely decreed, because it\r\nwas His sovereign will. Accordingly, they are born for this, to be\r\ndestroyed body and soul in hell. And they grow up under the irrevocable\r\ncurse of God, without any possibility of redemption; for what grace\r\nGod gives, He gives only for this, to increase, not prevent, their\r\ndamnation.”\r\n\r\nHaving effectually answered the objections of well meaning people,\r\nwho, startled at a doctrine so spectral, say, “This is not the\r\npredestination which I hold, I hold only the election of grace,” he\r\nsums up as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Though you use softer words than some, you mean the selfsame\r\n    thing; and God’s decree concerning the election of grace,\r\n    according to your account of it, amounts to neither more nor\r\n    less than what others call, ‘God’s decree of reprobation.’\r\n    Call it therefore by whatever name you please, ‘election,\r\n    preterition, predestination, or reprobation,’ it comes in the\r\n    end to the same thing. The sense of all is plainly this,—by\r\n    virtue of an eternal, unchangeable, irresistible decree of\r\n    God, one part of mankind are infallibly saved, and the rest\r\n    infallibly damned; it being impossible that any of the former\r\n    should be damned, or that any of the latter should be saved.”\r\n\r\nThis presents the doctrine in all its naked, hideous deformity; but it\r\nis fair, and no Calvinian dexterity can make it otherwise.\r\n\r\nWesley then proceeds to state the objections to such a doctrine:—\r\n\r\n1. It renders all preaching vain; for preaching is needless to them\r\nthat are elected; for they, whether with it or without it, will\r\ninfallibly be saved. And it is useless to them that are not elected;\r\nfor they, whether with preaching or without, will infallibly be damned.\r\n\r\n2. It directly tends to destroy that holiness which is the end of all\r\nthe ordinances of God; for it wholly takes away those first motives to\r\nfollow after holiness, so frequently proposed in Scripture, the hope of\r\nfuture reward and fear of punishment, the hope of heaven and fear of\r\nhell.\r\n\r\n3. It directly tends to destroy several particular branches of\r\nholiness; for it naturally tends to inspire, or increase, a sharpness\r\nof temper, which is quite contrary to the meekness of Christ, and leads\r\na man to treat with contempt, or coldness, those whom he supposes to be\r\noutcasts from God.\r\n\r\n4. It tends to destroy the comfort of religion.\r\n\r\n5. It directly tends to destroy our zeal for good works; for what\r\navails it to relieve the wants of those who are just dropping into\r\neternal fire!\r\n\r\n6. It has a direct and manifest tendency to overthrow the whole\r\nChristian revelation; for it makes it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n7. It makes the Christian revelation contradict itself; for it is\r\ngrounded on such an interpretation of some texts as flatly contradicts\r\nall the other texts, and indeed the whole scope and tenour of Scripture.\r\n\r\n8. It is full of blasphemy; for it represents our blessed Lord as a\r\nhypocrite and dissembler, in saying one thing and meaning another,—in\r\npretending a love which He had not; it also represents the most holy\r\nGod as more false, more cruel, and more unjust than the devil; for,\r\nin point of fact, it says that God has condemned millions of souls to\r\neverlasting fire for continuing in sin, which, for want of the grace He\r\ngives them not, they are unable to avoid.\r\n\r\nWesley sums up the whole thus:—\r\n\r\n    “This is the blasphemy clearly contained in _the horrible\r\n    decree_ of predestination. And here I fix my foot. On this\r\n    I join issue with every asserter of it. You represent God\r\n    as worse than the devil. But you say, you will prove it by\r\n    Scripture. Hold! what will you prove by Scripture? that God is\r\n    worse than the devil? It cannot be. Whatever that Scripture\r\n    proves, it never can prove this; whatever its true meaning be,\r\n    this cannot be its true meaning. Do you ask, ‘What is its true\r\n    meaning then?’ If I say, ‘I know not,’ you have gained nothing;\r\n    for there are many scriptures, the true sense whereof neither\r\n    you nor I shall know till death is swallowed up in victory. But\r\n    this I know, better it were to say it had no sense at all, than\r\n    to say it had such a sense as this.”\r\n\r\nIn Whitefield’s letter, already given, and dated September 25, 1740,\r\nhe states that already he had seen two pamphlets published against\r\nWesley’s sermon. One of these probably was the following: “Free Grace\r\nIndeed! A Letter to the Reverend Mr. John Wesley, relating to his\r\nsermon against absolute election, published under the title of Free\r\nGrace. London: 1740. Price sixpence.”\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent advertisement, Wesley writes, “Whereas a pamphlet,\r\nentitled, ‘Free Grace Indeed!’ has been published against this sermon,\r\nthis is to inform the publisher that I cannot answer his tract till he\r\nappears to be more in earnest; for I dare not speak of ‘the deep things\r\nof God’ in the spirit of a prizefighter or a stageplayer.”\r\n\r\nWith great respect for Wesley, we feel bound to say, that this is not\r\nworthy of him. The pamphlet referred to is before us, and is written\r\nwith great ability, earnestness, and good temper. Wesley was not bound\r\nto answer it; but he had no right thus to brand it.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, another pamphlet was published, on the other side,\r\nentitled, “The Controversy concerning Free-will and Predestination;\r\nin a Letter to a Friend. Recommended to Mr. Whitefield and his\r\nfollowers.” 8vo, pages 36. As the controversy continued, it waxed\r\nwarmer. Here Whitefield is spoken of as a man of “heated imagination,\r\nand full of himself”; “very hot, very self-sufficient, and impatient of\r\ncontradiction”; “dogmatical and dictatorial” in his way of speaking,\r\nand wont to finish his oracular deliverances “with his assuming air,\r\n_Dixi_.”\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet concludes with a verse which contains the pith of the\r\nwhole production:—\r\n\r\n    “Why is this _wrangling world_ thus _tossed_ and _torn_?\r\n    _Free-grace_, Free-will, are both together born;\r\n    If God’s free grace rule _in_, and _over_ me,\r\n    His will is mine, and so my will is _free_.”\r\n\r\nIn the month of October, Howel Harris took up the question, and wrote\r\nto Wesley, telling him that preaching electing love brings glory to\r\nGod, and benefit and consolation to the soul. He adds: “Oh, when will\r\nthe time come when we shall all agree? Till then, may the Lord enable\r\nus to bear with one another! We must, before we can be united, be\r\ntruly simple, made really humble and open to conviction, willing to\r\ngive up any expression that is not scriptural, dead to our names and\r\ncharacters, and sweetly inclined towards each other. I hope we have,\r\nin some measure, drank of the same Spirit, that we fight the same\r\nenemies, and are under the same crown and kingdom. We travel the same\r\nnarrow road, and love the same Jesus. We are soon to be before the\r\nsame throne, and employed in the same work of praise to all eternity.\r\nWhile, then, we are on the road, and meet with so many enemies, let us\r\nlove one another. And if we really carry on the same cause, let us not\r\nweaken each other’s hands.”[371]\r\n\r\nIn another letter, addressed to John Cennick, and dated October 27,\r\nHarris writes in less temperate language:—\r\n\r\n    “DEAR BROTHER,—Brother Seward tells me of his dividing with\r\n    brother Charles Wesley. He seems clear in his conviction,\r\n    that God would have him do so. I have been long waiting to\r\n    see if brother John and Charles should receive further light,\r\n    or be silent and not oppose election and perseverance; but,\r\n    finding no hope of this, I begin to be staggered how to act\r\n    towards them. I plainly see that we preach two gospels. My dear\r\n    brother, deal faithfully with brother John and Charles. If you\r\n    like, you may read this letter to them. We are free in Wales\r\n    from the hellish infection; but some are tainted when they come\r\n    to Bristol.”[372]\r\n\r\nIn November, Whitefield wrote to Wesley as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “PHILADELPHIA, _November 9, 1740_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR AND HONOURED SIR,—I received yours, dated March 11, this\r\n    afternoon. Oh that we were of one mind! for I am persuaded\r\n    you greatly err. You have set a mark you will never arrive at,\r\n    till you come to glory. O dear sir, many of God’s children are\r\n    grieved at your principles. Oh that God may give you a sight of\r\n    His free, sovereign, and electing love! But no more of this.\r\n    Why will you compel me to write thus? Why will you dispute? I\r\n    am willing to go with you to prison, and to death; but I am not\r\n    willing to oppose you. Dear, dear sir, study the covenant of\r\n    grace, that you may be consistent with yourself. Oh build up,\r\n    but do not lead into error, the souls once committed to the\r\n    charge of your affectionate, unworthy brother and servant, in\r\n    the loving Jesus,\r\n\r\n    “G. WHITEFIELD.”[373]\r\n\r\nA fortnight later he wrote again to Wesley:—\r\n\r\n    “BOHEMIA, MARYLAND, _November 24, 1740_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR AND HONOURED SIR,—Last night brother G—— brought me\r\n    your two kind letters. Oh that there may be harmony, and very\r\n    intimate union between us! Yet, it cannot be, since you hold\r\n    _universal redemption_. The devil rages in London. He begins\r\n    now to triumph indeed. The children of God are disunited\r\n    among themselves. My dear brother, for Christ’s sake, avoid\r\n    all disputation. Do not oblige me to preach against you; I\r\n    had rather die. Be gentle towards the——. They will get great\r\n    advantage over you, if they discover any irregular warmth in\r\n    your temper. I cannot for my soul unite with the _Moravian\r\n    Brethren_. Honoured sir, adieu!\r\n\r\n    “Yours eternally in Christ Jesus,\r\n    “GEORGE WHITEFIELD.”[374]\r\n\r\nJust at this time, Wesley was expounding Romans ix. at Bristol, where\r\nCalvinism was becoming rampant in the society. Charles Wesley writes:\r\n“Anne Ayling and Anne Davis could not refrain from railing. John\r\nCennick never offered to stop them. Alas, we have set the wolf to keep\r\nthe sheep! God gave me great moderation toward him, who, for many\r\nmonths, has been undermining our doctrine and authority.”[375]\r\n\r\nThe difference was continued by Whitefield writing his “Letter to the\r\nReverend Mr. John Wesley; in answer to his sermon, entitled ‘Free\r\nGrace’;” with the motto attached, “When Peter was come to Antioch, I\r\nwithstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.”\r\n\r\nThe “Letter” is dated, “Bethesda, in Georgia, December 24, 1740.”\r\nAfter reiterating his reluctance to write against Wesley, he proceeds\r\nto state, that he now did so at the request of a great number of\r\npersons, who had been benefited by his ministry. He accuses Wesley\r\nof having propagated the doctrine of universal redemption, both in\r\npublic and private, by preaching and printing, ever since before his\r\nlast departure for America. He says that Wesley, while at Bristol,\r\nreceived a letter, charging him with not preaching the gospel, because\r\nhe did not preach election. Upon this, he drew a lot; the answer\r\nwas, “_preach and print_;” and, accordingly, he preached and printed\r\nagainst election. At Whitefield’s desire, he deferred publishing the\r\nsermon until after Whitefield started for America, when he sent it out.\r\nWhitefield asserts, that, if any one wished to prove the doctrine of\r\nelection and of final perseverance, he could hardly wish for a text\r\nmore fit for his purpose than that (Romans viii. 32) which Wesley\r\nhad chosen to disprove it. He charges him with giving an “equivocal\r\ndefinition of the word _grace_,” and a “false definition of the word\r\n_free_;” and adds: “I frankly acknowledge, I believe the doctrine of\r\nreprobation, in this view, that God intends to give saving grace,\r\nthrough Jesus Christ, only to a certain number; and that the rest\r\nof mankind, after the fall of Adam, being justly left of God to\r\ncontinue in sin, will at last suffer that eternal death, which is its\r\nproper wages.” In reply to Wesley, he argues that, because preachers\r\nknow not who are elect, and who reprobate, they are bound to preach\r\npromiscuously to all; that holiness is made a mark of election by all\r\nwho preach it; that the seventeenth article of the English Church\r\nasserts, that the doctrine of “predestination and election in Christ is\r\nfull of unspeakable comfort to godly persons;” that dooming millions\r\nto everlasting burnings is not an act of injustice, because God, for\r\nthe sin of Adam, might justly have thus doomed all; that God’s absolute\r\npurpose of saving His chosen does not preclude the necessity of the\r\ngospel revelation, or the use of any of the means through which He has\r\ndetermined the decree shall take effect; that the doctrine of election\r\ndoes not make the Bible contradict itself, for though it asserts, that\r\n“the Lord is loving to every man, and His mercy is over all His works,”\r\nthe reference is to His _general_, not His _saving_ mercy; that it is\r\nunjust to charge the doctrine of reprobation with blasphemy; and that,\r\non the other hand, the doctrine of universal redemption, as set forth\r\nby Wesley, “is really the highest reproach upon the dignity of the Son\r\nof God, and the merit of His blood;” and Whitefield challenges Wesley\r\nto make good the assertion, “that Christ died for them that perish,”\r\nwithout holding, as Peter Bohler had lately confessed in a letter,\r\n“that all the damned souls would hereafter be brought out of hell;” for\r\n“how can all be universally redeemed, if all are not finally saved?”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, he writes:—\r\n\r\n    “Dear sir, for Jesus Christ’s sake, consider how you dishonour\r\n    God by denying election. You plainly make man’s salvation\r\n    depend not on God’s _free grace_, but on man’s _free will_.\r\n    Dear, dear sir, give yourself to reading. Study the covenant\r\n    of grace. Down with your carnal reasoning. Be a little child;\r\n    and then, instead of pawning your salvation, as you have done\r\n    in a late hymn-book, if the doctrine of _universal redemption_\r\n    be not true; instead of talking of _sinless perfection_, as\r\n    you have done in the preface to that hymn-book; and instead\r\n    of making man’s salvation to depend on his own _free will_,\r\n    as you have in this sermon, you will compose a hymn in praise\r\n    of sovereign, distinguishing love; you will caution believers\r\n    against striving to work a perfection out of their own hearts,\r\n    and will print another sermon the reverse of this, and entitle\r\n    it ‘Free Grace _Indeed_’—free, because not free to all; but\r\n    free, because God may withhold or give it to whom and when He\r\n    pleases.”[376]\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks after the date of this letter, Whitefield set sail\r\nfor England, bringing his manuscript with him. On his arrival in\r\nLondon, in March, 1741, he submitted it to Charles Wesley, who returned\r\nit to the author, endorsed with the words: “Put up again thy sword into\r\nits place.” The pamphlet, however, was published; and Whitefield gave\r\nWesley notice, that he was resolved publicly to preach against him and\r\nhis brother wherever he went. Wesley complained to Whitefield—1. That\r\nit was imprudent to publish his letter, because it was only putting\r\nweapons into the hands of those who hated them. 2. That, if he really\r\nwas constrained to bear his testimony on the subject, he might have\r\ndone it by issuing a treatise without ever calling Wesley’s name in\r\nquestion. 3. That what he had published was a mere burlesque upon an\r\nanswer. 4. That he had said enough, however, of what was wholly foreign\r\nto the question, to make an open, and probably irreparable, breach\r\nbetween them. Wesley added:—\r\n\r\n    “You rank all the maintainers of _universal redemption_ with\r\n    Socinians. Alas, my brother! Do you not know even this, that\r\n    Socinians allow no redemption at all? that Socinus himself\r\n    speaks thus, ‘_Tota redemptio nostra per Christum metaphora_’?\r\n    How easy were it for me to hit many other palpable blots, in\r\n    what you call an answer to my sermon! And how, above measure,\r\n    contemptible would you then appear to all impartial men,\r\n    either of sense or learning! But, I assure you, my hand shall\r\n    not be upon you. The Lord be judge between me and thee! The\r\n    general tenour, both of my public and private exhortations,\r\n    when I touch thereon at all, as even my enemies know, if they\r\n    would testify, is ‘Spare the young man, even Absalom, for my\r\n    sake!’”[377]\r\n\r\nDavid and Jonathan were divided. An immediate schism followed. Wesley\r\nwrites:—“In March, 1741, Mr. Whitefield, being returned to England,\r\nentirely separated from Mr. Wesley and his friends, because he did not\r\nhold the decrees. Here was the first breach, which warm men persuaded\r\nMr. Whitefield to make merely for a difference of opinion. Those who\r\nbelieved universal redemption had no desire to separate; but those\r\nwho held particular redemption would not hear of any accommodation,\r\nbeing determined to have no fellowship with men that were ‘in such\r\ndangerous errors.’ So there were now two sorts of Methodists: those for\r\nparticular, and those for general, redemption.”[378]\r\n\r\nHere, for the present, we leave the subject; and turn to other matters.\r\n\r\nIn 1740, as in 1739, the pamphlets published against Methodism were\r\nmany and malignant. One was entitled: “The important Doctrines of\r\nOriginal Sin, Justification by Faith, and Regeneration, clearly stated\r\nand vindicated from the misrepresentations of the Methodists. By Thomas\r\nWhiston, A.B.” London: 1740. Pp. 70. Mr. Whiston is unknown to fame.\r\nWesley never noticed him; and, though his production is now before us,\r\nan analysis of its contents would weary the reader without instructing\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnother was, “The Quakers and Methodists compared. By the Rev. Zachary\r\nGrey, LL.D., Rector of Houghton Conquest, in Bedfordshire,”—the\r\nlaborious author of more than thirty different publications, a man of\r\ngreat ingenuity and research, but an acrimonious polemic, who died at\r\nAmpthill, in 1766.[379]\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, that Whitefield was far more violently attacked\r\nthan the Wesleys were. “Aquila Smyth, a layman of the Church of\r\nEngland,” accuses him of having published two letters against\r\nArchbishop Tillotson, “in the spirit of pride, envy, and malice;” and\r\nof having “detracted the most valuable works of other men, in order to\r\naggrandize himself, and gain credit for his own weak, impudent, and\r\nwicked performances.” His “behaviour exposes him to the scorn of every\r\nreader;” and his “consummate impudence” is unequalled in the Christian\r\nworld. There “is a juggle between him and Wesley to deceive their\r\nfollowers, and to prevent an inquiry into their corrupt and abominable\r\ndoctrine;” and, finally, after calling him “a brainsick enthusiast,”\r\nSmyth declares, that Whitefield has taken up five thousand acres in\r\nAmerica, under the pretence of educating and maintaining such negroes\r\nas may be sent to him; but really because he hopes to realise from\r\nthe transaction a more plentiful fortune than he could have gained in\r\nEngland by five thousand years of preaching.\r\n\r\nSo much for the spleen of Aquila Smyth. In the _Weekly Miscellany_,\r\nedited by Mr. Hooker, there appeared, in several successive numbers,\r\nfictitious dialogues between Whitefield and a country clergyman, the\r\nobject of which was to make Whitefield contemptible; and the whole\r\nwere finished with a promise from the editor, that he would abridge,\r\nfor the benefit of his subscribers, the history of the Anabaptists,\r\nand would show that there is a near resemblance between them and their\r\ndescendants, the Methodists.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Alexander Garden, the Bishop of London’s commissary at\r\nCharlestown, in America, published a series of six letters on\r\njustification by faith and works, in which he accused Whitefield of\r\n“self contradiction,” of “arrogant and wicked slander,” and of being\r\n“so full of zeal that he had no room for charity.” He contemptuously\r\nspeaks of Whitefield’s “apparent shuffles,” “miserable distinctions,”\r\n“mob harangues,” and “false and poisoned insinuations.” Whitefield\r\n“deceives the people, and has no talent at proving anything”; he is “a\r\nhare-brained solifidian, and runs about a mouthing”; he has “kindled\r\na fire of slander and defamation, which no devil in hell, nor jesuit\r\non earth, will ever make an effort to extinguish, but will fagot and\r\nfoment it with all their might”; “he dispenses to the populace in a\r\nvehicle of cant terms, without sense or meaning”; and “in a mountebank\r\nway, he fancies himself a young David, and that he has slain Goliath.”\r\n\r\nWhitefield was again severely handled “by a presbyter of the Church of\r\nEngland,” in an able pamphlet of forty-four pages, entitled “A modest\r\nand serious Defence of the Author of the Whole Duty of Man, from the\r\nfalse charges and gross misrepresentations of Mr. Whitefield, and the\r\nMethodists his adherents”; but this was a castigation which Whitefield\r\nmerited, for his ill judged and unneeded letter, published in the\r\n_Daily Advertiser_ of July 3, 1740.\r\n\r\nThe most violent attack of all was in an octavo pamphlet of\r\neighty-five pages, with the title, “The Expounder Expounded, by R——ph\r\nJ——ps——n, of the Inner Temple, Esq.” London. Some parts of this\r\ndisgraceful production are too filthy to be noticed; they must be\r\npassed in silence. In other parts, Whitefield, for publishing his\r\njournal, is charged with “saddling the world with one of the grossest\r\nabsurdities and impositions, that folly or impudence could invent”;\r\n“his book is nothing but a continued account of his intimate union\r\nand correspondence with the devil”; and he himself may be seen “upon\r\nthe hills and house-tops, like another Æolus, belching out his divine\r\nvapours to the multitude, to the great ease of himself, and emolument\r\nof his auditors.” “Charles Wesley lent him books at Oxford, which threw\r\nhis understanding off the hinges, and rendered him _enthusiastically_\r\ncrazy”; at college he “deemed a lousy pate _humility_, foul linen was\r\n_heavenly contemplation_, woollen gloves were _grace_, a patched gown\r\nwas _justification by faith_, and dirty shoes meant a _walk with God_.\r\nIn short, with him, religion consisted wholly in _nastiness_, and\r\nheaven was easiest attacked from a _dunghill_.” These are the mildest\r\nspecimens we have been able to select from this cesspool of a perverted\r\nintellect and a polluted heart.\r\n\r\nAnother pamphlet, published in 1740, and consisting of eighty-four\r\npages, was entitled “The Imposture of Methodism displayed; in a letter\r\nto the inhabitants of the parish of Dewsbury. Occasioned by the rise\r\nof a certain modern sect of enthusiasts, called Methodists. By William\r\nBowman, M. A., vicar of Dewsbury and Aldbrough in Yorkshire, and\r\nchaplain to the Right Honourable Charles, Earl of Hoptoun.” As yet,\r\nneither the Wesleys nor Whitefield had been in Yorkshire; but Ingham\r\nand William Delamotte were there, and had been the means of converting\r\na large number of the almost heathenised inhabitants of the west\r\nriding. The reverend vicar tells his parishioners, that “an impious\r\nspirit of enthusiasm and superstition has crept in among them, and\r\nthreatens a total ruin of all religion and virtue.” He himself has been\r\n“an eye-witness of this monstrous madness, and religious frenzy, which,\r\nlike a rapid torrent, bears down everything beautiful before it, and\r\nintroduces nothing but a confused and ridiculous medley of nonsense and\r\ninconsistency.” It was matter of thankfulness, “that the contagion,\r\nat present, was pretty much confined to the dregs and refuse of the\r\npeople,—the weak, unsteady mob, always fond of innovation, and never\r\npleased but with variety;” but, then, the mob was so numerous in the\r\nwest of Yorkshire, that the danger was greater than was apprehended.\r\nThe author declines to determine whether “these modern visionaries,\r\nlike the Quakers, are a sect hatched and fashioned in a seminary of\r\nJesuits; or whether, like the German Anabaptists, they are a set of\r\ncrazy, distempered fanatics;” but certain it is, that their “enthusiasm\r\nis patched and made up of a thousand incoherencies and absurdities,\r\npicked and collected from the vilest errors and most pestilent follies,\r\nof every heresy upon earth.” “Their teachers inculcate, that they are\r\nDivinely and supernaturally inspired by the Holy Ghost, to declare\r\nthe will of God to mankind; and, yet, they are cheats and impostors,\r\nand their pretended sanctity nothing but a trick and a delusion.”\r\nThey had been allowed to use the pulpits of the Church, “till, by\r\ntheir flights and buffooneries, they had made the church more like a\r\nbear-garden than the house of prayer; and the rostrum nothing else but\r\nthe trumpet of sedition, heresy, blasphemy, and everything destructive\r\nto religion and good manners.” It was high time for the clergy to put\r\nan end to their “pulpits being let out, as a stage, for mountebanks and\r\njack-puddings to play their tricks upon, and from thence to propagate\r\ntheir impostures and delusions.” “These mad devotionalists held, that\r\nit is lawful and expedient for mere laymen, for women, and the meanest\r\nand most ignorant mechanics, to minister in the church of Christ, to\r\npreach, and expound the word of God, and to offer up the prayers of the\r\ncongregation in the public assemblies.” They also taught, that “the\r\nnew birth consists in an absolute and entire freedom from all kind of\r\nsin whatsoever;” and likewise “denounced eternal death and damnation\r\non all who cannot conform to their ridiculous ideas.” “Whilst adopting\r\nto themselves the reputation of being the chief favourites of heaven,\r\nthe confidants and imparters of its secrets, and the dispensers of its\r\nfrowns and favours, they were really furious disciples of antichrist,\r\nreverend scavengers of scandal, and filthy pests and plagues of\r\nmankind.” Such are specimens of the meek language used by the reverend\r\nvicar of Dewsbury.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed one production of the fiery and furious\r\nJoseph Trapp, D.D., published in 1739. The publication of that\r\nproduced others, in 1740. One was entitled, “The true Spirit of the\r\nMethodists, and their Allies, fully laid open; in an answer to six\r\nof the seven pamphlets, lately published against Dr. Trapp’s sermons\r\nupon being ‘Righteous over much’”: pp. 98. The anonymous author says,\r\nthat one of these six pamphlets is full of “false quotations, lies,\r\nand slanders,” and concludes with “an ungodly jumble of railing and\r\npraying.” The Methodists are branded as “crack-brained enthusiasts and\r\nprofane hypocrites.” “The criterions of modern saintship are the most\r\nunchristian malice, lying, slander, railing, and cursing.” Whitefield\r\nis pronounced “impious and ignorant.” The “false doctrines and\r\nblasphemies of the Methodists, their field assemblies and conventicles\r\nin houses, are contrary to the laws of God and man, of church and\r\nstate, and are tending to the ruin of both.”\r\n\r\nAnother pamphlet, of 127 pages, was by Dr. Trapp himself, and entitled,\r\n“A Reply to Mr. Law’s earnest and serious Answer (as it is called)\r\nto Dr. Trapp’s discourse on being righteous over much.” The reverend\r\ndoctor, as inflammable as ever, pronounces the Methodists “a new sect\r\nof enthusiasts, or hypocrites, or both; whose doctrines and practices\r\ntend to the destruction of souls, are a scandal to Christianity,\r\nand expose it to the scoffs of libertines, infidels, and atheists.”\r\nThis is not an unfair specimen of the whole 127 pages. William Law,\r\nhowever, was far too stout an antagonist to be silenced by Dr. Trapp.\r\nHis “Serious Answer” to Trapp’s sermons, and his “Animadversions”\r\non Trapp’s reply, whilst written in the highest style of Christian\r\ncourtesy, are witheringly severe. They may be found in Wesley’s\r\ncollected publications, edit. 1772, vol. vi.\r\n\r\nAnother doughty anti-Methodistic champion was the celebrated Dr. Daniel\r\nWaterland, chaplain in ordinary to his majesty, canon of Windsor,\r\narchdeacon of Middlesex, and vicar of Twickenham; one of the greatest\r\ncontroversialists of the age, who died at the end of the year of which\r\nwe are writing, and whose collected works have since been published in\r\neleven octavo volumes.\r\n\r\nA few months before his death, Waterland preached two sermons, first\r\nat Twickenham, and next at Windsor, on regeneration, which, without\r\nmentioning the Methodists, were undeniably meant to serve as an\r\nantidote to the doctrines they preached. These he published in the\r\nform of an octavo pamphlet of fifty-six pages, accompanied by a mass\r\nof notes in Latin, Greek, and English, from all sorts of authors. The\r\ntitle of the pamphlet is, “Regeneration Stated and Explained, according\r\nto Scripture and Antiquity, in a Discourse on Titus iii. 4, 5, 6;”\r\nand its subject may be inferred from the following definition:—“The\r\nnew birth, in the general, means a spiritual change, wrought upon\r\nany person by the Holy Spirit, in the use of baptism; whereby he is\r\ntranslated from his natural state in Adam, to a spiritual state in\r\nChrist.” Written from such a standpoint, the pamphlet of course was a\r\ntacit condemnation of the doctrines of the Methodists. It is immensely\r\nlearned, but far from luminous; full of talent, but likewise full of\r\nerror; exceedingly elaborate, but, to an equal extent, bewildering.\r\n\r\nWe shall mention only one other attack on Methodism and the Methodists\r\nmade at this period. This was a pamphlet of fifty-five pages, with\r\nthe title, “The Trial of Mr. Whitefield’s Spirit, in some remarks\r\nupon his fourth Journal.” The author makes himself merry with the\r\ndiscovery, that this new sect of enthusiasts, by taking to themselves\r\nthe name of _Methodist_, have unintentionally stigmatised themselves\r\nwith a designation which is branded in Scripture as evil. “The\r\nword Μεθοδεια, or Methodism, is only used twice throughout the New\r\nTestament (Ephesians iv. 14, and vi. 11), and in both places denotes\r\nthat cunning craftiness whereby evil men, or evil spirits, lie in\r\nwait to deceive.” It is alleged that Wesley, Whitefield, and their\r\nfollowers, “have taken an appellation, perhaps through a judicial\r\ninadvertence, which the Spirit of God has peculiarly appropriated to\r\nthe adversary of mankind, and to those who are leagued with him in\r\nenmity to the interests of righteousness and true holiness.” This was\r\nan ingenious hit; the writer, however, forgetting or misstating the\r\nfact, that the name of Methodists was not self-assumed, but imposed by\r\nothers. “Μεθοδευσαι δε εστι το απατησαι—to be a Methodist, says St.\r\nChrysostom, is to be beguiled.” And, from this, the author wishes the\r\ninference to be deduced, that, because the new sect of enthusiasts were\r\ncalled Methodists, they were all beguiled, and, of course, Wesley and\r\nWhitefield were the great beguilers. The remainder of the pamphlet is\r\na critique on Whitefield’s Journals, which, it must be admitted, were\r\nunguardedly expressed, and which, before being printed, ought to have\r\nbeen revised by a kindred spirit, possessed of a soberer judgment than\r\nWhitefield had.\r\n\r\nThe Methodist persecutions of 1740 were chiefly of a literary kind. It\r\nis true that Charles Wesley met with a rough reception at Bengeworth,\r\nwhere Henry Seward called him “a scoundrel and a rascal”; directed\r\nthe mob to “take him away and duck him”; and actually seized him by\r\nthe nose and wrung it. This was bad enough, but the treatment of John\r\nCennick and his friends was even worse. While he was preaching at\r\nUpton, in Gloucestershire, the mob assembled with a horn, a drum, and\r\na number of brass pans, and made a most horrid hubbub; the brass pans\r\nbeing also used in beating the people’s heads. A man likewise put a\r\ncat into a cage, and brought a pack of hounds to make them bark at it.\r\nAnother fellow and his wife, who kept an alehouse at Hannam, rode\r\nthrough the congregation, thrashing the people with their whips, and\r\ntrampling them beneath their horses’ hoofs. Little children collected\r\ndust, which their upgrown patrons cast upon Cennick, who was also\r\nstruck violently on the nose, and became a target at which to hurl dead\r\ndogs and stones.[380] But even violent and contemptuous treatment like\r\nthis was not near so painful as the scurrilous attacks encountered\r\nthrough the press. In this way, the persecution of the Methodists was\r\nsomething more than a localised outburst of spleen and hate; for, in\r\nall sorts of squibs, they were gibbeted, and exposed to ridicule,\r\nthroughout the kingdom.\r\n\r\nWesley’s trials were not trifles; but, in the midst of all, he bravely\r\npursued the path of duty; and, after the final separation from his\r\nfoolish, fanatical friends at Fetter Lane, his labours in London were\r\nattended with considerable success. On August 11, while forty or fifty\r\nwere praying and giving thanks at the Foundery, two persons began to\r\ncry to God with a loud and bitter cry, and soon found peace. Five\r\ndays after, a woman, at Long Lane, fell down and continued in violent\r\nagonies for an hour. In September, a great number of men forced their\r\nway into the Foundery, and began to speak big, swelling words; but,\r\n“immediately after, the hammer of the word brake the rocks in pieces.”\r\nA smuggler rushed in and cursed vehemently; but, when Wesley finished\r\npreaching, the man declared, before the congregation, that, henceforth,\r\nhe would abandon smuggling and give God his heart.\r\n\r\nWesley’s efforts to do good were various. In London, he induced his\r\nfriends to contribute the clothing they could spare, and distributed it\r\namong the poor of the Foundery society. In Bristol, besides visiting\r\nnumbers of people “ill of the spotted fever,” he took into his\r\nBroadmead meeting-house twelve of the poorest people he could find,\r\nwho were out of work; and, to save them at once from want and from\r\nidleness, employed them for four months in carding and spinning cotton.\r\n\r\nWesley concluded this eventful year at Bristol, by holding a\r\nwatchnight meeting, proposed by James Rogers, a Kingswood collier,\r\nnoted among his neighbours for his playing on the violin, but who,\r\nbeing awakened under the ministry of Charles Wesley, went home, burnt\r\nhis fiddle, and told his wife that he meant to be a Methodist. To\r\nhis death, James was faithful, and, besides many other important\r\nservices, was the first Methodist preacher that preached at Stroud in\r\nGloucestershire.[381]\r\n\r\nThis was the first watchnight meeting among the Methodists. The people\r\nmet at half-past eight; the house was filled from end to end; and “we\r\nconcluded the year,” says Wesley, “wrestling with God in prayer, and\r\npraising Him for the wonderful work which He had already wrought upon\r\nthe earth.”\r\n\r\nThe meeting soon became a favourite one, and was held monthly. Wesley\r\nwrites: “Some advised me to put an end to this; but, upon weighing the\r\nthing thoroughly, and comparing it with the practice of the ancient\r\nChristians, I could see no cause to forbid it. Rather, I believed\r\nit might be made of more general use.”[382] ‘The church, in ancient\r\ntimes, was accustomed to spend whole nights in prayer, which nights\r\nwere termed _vigiliæ_, or vigils; and, sanctioned by such authority,\r\nWesley appointed monthly watchnights, on the Fridays nearest the full\r\nmoon, desiring that they, and they only, should attend, who could do it\r\nwithout prejudice to their business or families.\r\n\r\nLittle more remains to be said concerning 1740. During the entire year,\r\nWesley preached in only three churches, namely at Newbury, and at\r\nLanhithel, and Lantarnum, in Wales. His favourite text was Ephesians\r\nii. 8, showing that his mind and heart were still full of the glorious\r\ntruth, salvation by grace through faith in Christ.\r\n\r\nOne of his publications has been already noticed. Another was a third\r\nvolume of hymns, pp. 209, by no means inferior to its predecessors in\r\npoetic excellence, or Christian character. The book is also possessed\r\nof considerable historic interest, containing, as it does, a long hymn\r\nof twenty-two verses, descriptive of Charles Wesley’s history up to\r\nthis period; and likewise several hymns addressed to Whitefield; and\r\none “for the Kingswood colliers.” The volume consists of ninety-six\r\nhymns and poems, only four of which are selected from other authors.\r\nThe preface is remarkable, giving a description of the man possessed\r\nof a clean heart. He is freed from pride, self will, evil thoughts,\r\nwandering thoughts, doubts, fears, etc. Wesley, a quarter of a century\r\nafterwards, declared that this preface contains the strongest account\r\nthat he ever gave of Christian perfection; and admitted, that some\r\nof the statements needed correction; especially, that the perfect\r\nChristian is so “freed from self will as not to desire ease in pain;”\r\nthat, “in prayer, he is so delivered from wanderings, that he has no\r\nthought of anything past, or absent, or to come, but of God alone,”\r\netc. Wesley never taught anything respecting Christian perfection, but\r\nwhat was, either directly or indirectly, contained in this preface; but\r\nsome of its strong assertions he wished to modify.[383]\r\n\r\nAnother publication, issued in 1740, was entitled, “Serious\r\nConsiderations concerning the Doctrines of Election and Reprobation.\r\nExtracted from a late author.” 12mo, twelve pages. It is a condensed,\r\nwell argued tract on what had become a bone of contention between\r\nWesley and his friend Whitefield. The address to the reader is\r\nbeautiful: “Let us bear with one another, remembering it is\r\nthe prerogative of the great God to pierce through all His own\r\ninfinite schemes with an unerring eye, to surround them with an\r\nall-comprehensive view, to grasp them all in one single survey, and to\r\nspread a reconciling light over all their immense varieties. Man must\r\nyet grapple with difficulties in this dusky twilight; but God, in His\r\ntime, will irradiate the earth more plentifully with His light and\r\ntruth.”\r\n\r\nAnother of Wesley’s publications was a 12mo tract of nineteen pages,\r\nwith the title, “The Nature and Design of Christianity, extracted from\r\na late author” (Mr. Law); and another was Wesley’s second Journal,\r\nextending from February 1 to August 12, 1738. 12mo, pp. 90.\r\n\r\nThe year 1740, in Wesley’s history, was not marked with great\r\nreligious success; but it was one of the most eventful years in\r\nhis chequered life. There was a full and final separation from the\r\nMoravians; there was the separate organisation of the Methodist society\r\nat Moorfields; and there was the controversy with Whitefield. All these\r\nmatters will again demand attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1741.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1741 Age 38]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a week spent in the midland counties, about a\r\nmonth at Oxford, and three weeks in Wales, Wesley divided the year\r\n1741, in almost equal proportions, between London and Bristol.\r\n\r\nWhitefield arrived in England, from America, in the month of March;\r\nand, finding his congregations at Moorfields and Kennington Common\r\ndwindled down from twenty thousand to two or three hundred, he started\r\noff to Bristol, where he remained till the end of May; when he came\r\nback to London, and, on July 25, sailed thence to Scotland, writing\r\nsix-and-twenty pastoralizing letters on the way, and arriving at Leith\r\non July 30. The next three months were spent with the Erskines and\r\nothers, the leaders of the Seceders, who, in the year preceding, had\r\nbeen solemnly expelled by the General Assembly, and had had their\r\nrelation to the national church formally dissolved. Whitefield’s career\r\nof out-door preaching, and his success in Scotland, were marvellous.\r\nAll the time, however, he was burdened with an enormous debt, incurred\r\non account of his orphan house in Georgia, and was sometimes threatened\r\nwith arrest. On leaving Scotland, he proceeded direct to Wales, where,\r\non the 11th of November, he married a widow of the name of James, and\r\nset up housekeeping with borrowed furniture, though, according to an\r\nannouncement in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_,[384] his wife had a fortune\r\nof £10,000. The rest of the year he spent chiefly in Bristol and the\r\nwest of England.[385]\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley, of course, alternated with his brother, though he\r\npreached far more at Bristol than in London. Ever and anon he composed\r\none of his grand funereal hymns, and not unfrequently met with amusing\r\nadventures. In a Kingswood prayer-meeting, while he and others were\r\npraying for an increase of spiritual children, a wild collier brought\r\nfour of his black-faced little ones, and threw the youngest on the\r\ntable, saying, “You have got the mother, take the bairns as well.” In\r\nanother instance, a woman came to him about her husband, who had been\r\nto hear the _predestinarian_ gospel, returned home _elect_, and, in\r\nproof of it, _beat his wife_.\r\n\r\nFor some months, in the year 1741, Charles Wesley was in danger of\r\nsubsiding into Moravian _stillness_; and his brother wrote to him, “The\r\nPhilistines are upon thee, Samson, but the Lord is not departed from\r\nthee.” Gambold also, and Westley Hall, were inoculated with the same\r\npernicious poison. Charles went off to Bristol, and on April 21 Wesley\r\naddressed to him the following:—\r\n\r\n    “I rejoice in your speaking your mind freely. O let our love be\r\n    without dissimulation!\r\n\r\n    “As yet, I dare in nowise join with the Moravians: 1. Because\r\n    their whole scheme is mystical, not scriptural. 2. Because\r\n    there is darkness and closeness in their whole behaviour, and\r\n    guile in almost all their words. 3. Because they utterly deny\r\n    and despise self denial and the daily cross. 4. Because they,\r\n    upon principle, conform to the world, in wearing gold or costly\r\n    apparel. 5. Because they extend Christian liberty, in this and\r\n    many other respects, beyond what is warranted in holy writ.\r\n    6. Because they are by no means zealous of good works; or, at\r\n    least, only to their own people. And, lastly, because they\r\n    make inward religion swallow up outward in general. For these\r\n    reasons chiefly, I will rather stand quite alone, than join\r\n    with them: I mean till I have full assurance, that they will\r\n    spread none of their errors among the little flock committed to\r\n    my charge.\r\n\r\n    “O my brother, my soul is grieved for you; the poison is in\r\n    you: fair words have stolen away your heart. ‘No English man or\r\n    woman is like the Moravians!’ So the matter is come to a fair\r\n    issue. Five of us did still stand together a few months since;\r\n    but two are gone to the right hand, Hutchins and Cennick; and\r\n    two more to the left, Mr. Hall and you. Lord, if it be Thy\r\n    gospel which I preach, arise and maintain Thine own cause!\r\n    Adieu!”[386]\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, a reunion of Wesley’s London society with the\r\nMoravians at Fetter Lane was solemnly discussed; and all the bands\r\nmet at the Foundery, on a Wednesday afternoon, to ask God to give\r\nthem guidance. “It was clear to all,” writes Wesley, “even those who\r\nwere before the most desirous of reunion, that the time was not come:\r\n(1) because the brethren of Fetter Lane had not given up their most\r\nessentially erroneous doctrines; and, (2) because many of us had found\r\nso much guile in their words, that we could scarce tell what they\r\nreally held, and what not.”\r\n\r\nWesley entertained no bitterness towards the Moravians. He readily\r\nacknowledges, that they had a sincere desire to serve God; that many\r\nof them had tasted of His love that they abstained from outward sin;\r\nand that their discipline, in most respects, was excellent: but, after\r\nreading all their English publications, and “waiving their odd and\r\naffected phrases; their weak, mean, silly, childish expressions; their\r\ncrude, confused, and undigested notions; and their whims, unsupported\r\neither by Scripture or sound reason,”—he found three grand, unretracted\r\nerrors running through almost all their books, namely “universal\r\nsalvation, antinomianism, and a kind of new, reformed quietism.” No\r\nwonder that the thought of reunion was abandoned.\r\n\r\nA month after the above meeting, at the Foundery, Wesley made a tour\r\namong the Moravians, in the midland counties. Here Ingham had preached\r\nwith great success; and here Mr. Simpson, one of the Oxford Methodists,\r\nhad settled as a sort of Moravian minister. During the journey, Wesley\r\nmade an experiment which he had often been urged to make, namely that\r\nof speaking to no one on sacred things, unless his heart was free to\r\nit. The result was, that, for eighty miles together, he had no need to\r\nspeak at all; and he tells us that, instead of having crosses to take\r\nup and bear, he commonly fell fast asleep; and all behaved to him, as\r\nto a civil, good-natured gentleman. On reaching Ockbrook, where Simpson\r\nlived, he found that though, a few months before, there had been a\r\ngreat awakening all round about, three-fourths of the converts were\r\nnow backsliders. Simpson had drawn the people from the Church, and\r\nhad advised them to abandon devotion. He said, there was no Church of\r\nEngland left; and that there was no scriptural command for family or\r\nprivate prayer. The sum of his teaching was: “If you wish to believe,\r\nbe still; and leave off what you call the means of grace, such as\r\nprayer and running to church and sacrament.” Mr. Graves, the clergyman\r\nof the parish, having offered the use of his church to Wesley, the\r\nlatter preached two sermons, one on “the true gospel stillness”, and\r\nthe other from his favourite text—“By grace are ye saved, through\r\nfaith.”\r\n\r\nFrom Ockbrook, Wesley went to Nottingham, where he found further\r\nevidences of backsliding. The room, which used to be crowded, was now\r\nhalf empty; and the few who did attend the services, instead of praying\r\nwhen they entered, sat down without any religious formality whatever,\r\nand began talking to their neighbours. When Wesley engaged in prayer\r\namong them, none knelt, and “those who stood chose the most easy and\r\nindolent posture which they conveniently could.” One of the hymn-books,\r\npublished by the Wesleys, had been sent from London to be used in the\r\npublic congregations; but both that and the Bible were now banished;\r\nand, in the place of them, lay the Moravian hymns and Zinzendorf’s\r\nsixteen sermons. Wesley preached twice in this Moravian meeting; and\r\nonce in the market place, to an immense multitude, all of whom, with\r\ntwo or three exceptions, behaved with great decorum.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a week at Markfield, Ockbrook, Nottingham, Melbourn, and\r\nHemmington, and also probably becoming acquainted with the Countess of\r\nHuntingdon, who lived in this locality, Wesley returned to town, on the\r\n16th of June, and, a fortnight after, went to Oxford, where he met his\r\nold friend Mr. Gambold, who honestly told him, he was ashamed of his\r\ncompany, and must be excused going to the Moravian meeting with him.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of September, Zinzendorf wished to have an interview,\r\nand, at his request, Wesley went to Gray’s-inn Walk, a public\r\npromenade, to meet him. Zinzendorf charged him with having changed his\r\nreligion; with having quarreled with the Brethren; and with having\r\nrefused to be at peace with them, even after they had asked his\r\nforgiveness. In reference to Wesley’s doctrine of Christian perfection,\r\nthe count became furious. “This,” said he, “is the error of errors. I\r\npursue it through the world with fire and sword. I trample upon it. I\r\ndevote it to utter destruction. Christ is our sole perfection. Whoever\r\nfollows inherent perfection, denies Christ. All Christian perfection\r\nis faith in the blood of Christ; and is wholly imputed, not inherent.”\r\nWesley asked, if they were not striving about words; and, by a series\r\nof questions, got the obfuscated German to admit, “that, a believer\r\nis altogether holy in heart and life,—that he loves God with all his\r\nheart, and serves Him with all his powers.” Wesley continued: “I\r\ndesire nothing more. I mean nothing else by perfection, or Christian\r\nholiness.” Zinzendorf rejoined: “But this is not the believer’s\r\nholiness. He is not more holy if he loves more, or less holy, if he\r\nloves less. In the moment he is justified, he is sanctified wholly;\r\nand, from that time, he is neither more nor less holy, even unto death.\r\nOur whole justification, and sanctification, are in the same instant.\r\nFrom the moment any one is justified, his heart is as pure as it\r\never will be.” Wesley asked again: “Perhaps I do not comprehend your\r\nmeaning. Do we not, while we deny ourselves, die more and more to the\r\nworld and live to God?” Zinzendorf replied: “We reject all self denial.\r\nWe trample upon it. We do, as believers, whatsoever we will, and\r\nnothing more. We laugh at all mortification. No purification precedes\r\nperfect love.”[387] And thus the conference ended.\r\n\r\n“The count,” said Mr. Stonehouse after reading the conversation, “is a\r\nclever fellow; but the genius of Methodism is too strong for him.”[388]\r\n\r\nZinzendorf accused Wesley of refusing to live in peace, even after the\r\nBrethren had humbled themselves and begged his pardon. Wesley says\r\nthere is a mistake in this. Fifty or more Moravians spoke bitterly\r\nagainst him; one or two asked his pardon, but did it in the most\r\ncareless manner possible. The rest, if ashamed of their behaviour at\r\nall, managed to keep their shame a profound secret from him.[389]\r\n\r\nAs to the count’s theory, that a man is wholly sanctified the moment\r\nhe is justified—a theory held by the Rev. Dr. Bunting, at all events,\r\nat the commencement of his ministerial career[390]—we say nothing; but\r\nthere can be no question, that his sentiments respecting self denial,\r\nand the right of believers to do or not to do what they like, are, in\r\na high degree, delusive and dangerous. We have here the very essence of\r\nthe antinomian heresy, and are thus prepared for an entry in Charles\r\nWesley’s journal:—\r\n\r\n    1741. September 6.—“I was astonished by a letter from my\r\n    brother, relating his conference with the apostle of the\r\n    Moravians. Who would believe it of Count Zinzendorf, that he\r\n    should utterly deny all Christian holiness? I never could, but\r\n    for a saying of his, which I heard with my own ears. Speaking\r\n    of St. James’s epistle, he said: ‘If it was thrown out of the\r\n    canon, I would not restore it.’”\r\n\r\nThe heresy of such a man was of vast importance; for, in this same year\r\nand month, September, 1741, Zinzendorf told Doddridge, that he had\r\n“sent out, from his own family of Moravians, three hundred preachers,\r\nwho were gone into most parts of the world; and that he himself was now\r\nbecome the guardian of the Protestant churches in the south of France,\r\nsixty of which were assembling privately for worship.”[391]\r\n\r\nAs already stated, Charles Wesley was in danger of falling into the\r\nMoravian heresy. The following is an extract from a letter addressed to\r\nWesley by the Countess of Huntingdon, and dated October 24, 1741.\r\n\r\n    “Since you left us, the _still ones_ are not without their\r\n    attacks. I fear much more for your brother than for myself,\r\n    as the conquest of the one would be nothing in respect to the\r\n    other. They have, by one of their agents, reviled me very much,\r\n    but I have taken no sort of notice of it. I comfort myself,\r\n    that you will approve a step with respect to them, which your\r\n    brother and I have taken: no less than his declaring open war\r\n    against them. He seemed under some difficulty about it at\r\n    first, till he had free liberty given him to use my name, as\r\n    the instrument, in God’s hand, that had delivered him from\r\n    them. I rejoiced much at it, hoping it might be the means of\r\n    working my deliverance from them. I have desired him to enclose\r\n    to them yours on Christian perfection. The doctrine therein\r\n    contained, I hope to live and die by; it is absolutely the most\r\n    complete thing I know. Your brother is also to give his reasons\r\n    for separating. I have great faith God will not let him fall;\r\n    for many would fall with him. His natural parts, his judgment,\r\n    and the improvement he has made, are so very far above the very\r\n    highest of them, that I should imagine nothing but frenzy had\r\n    seized upon him.\r\n\r\n    “We set out a week ago for Donnington, and you shall hear from\r\n    me as soon as I arrive, and have heard how your little flock\r\n    goes on in that neighbourhood.”[392]\r\n\r\nMethodists will learn, from this interesting letter, that they owe a\r\ndebt of gratitude to the noble and “elect lady” of the midland counties.\r\n\r\nWe turn to Whitefield. On his arrival from America, in the month of\r\nMarch, he found his position far from pleasant.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there was the melancholy death of his friend, William\r\nSeward—really Methodism’s first martyr—a man of considerable property,\r\nbut of meagre education and inferior talent; Whitefield’s travelling\r\ncompanion in his second voyage to Georgia, and who, at the time of\r\nhis being murdered, in Wales, was itinerating with Howel Harris in\r\nGlamorganshire. At Newport, the mob had torn Harris’s coat to tatters,\r\nstolen his wig, and pelted him and his companion with apples, stones,\r\nand dirt. At Caerleon, rotten eggs were thrown in all directions,\r\nSeward’s eye was struck, and, a few days after, he was entirely blind.\r\nAt Monmouth, their treatment was of the same kind as at Newport and\r\nCaerleon; but Seward bravely cried, “Better endure this than hell.”\r\nAt length, on reaching Hay, a villain hit him on the head; the blow\r\nwas fatal; and William Seward went to inherit a martyr’s crown, at the\r\nearly age of thirty-eight, on October 22, 1741.\r\n\r\nBesides the death of Methodism’s protomartyr, there were other troubles\r\nwhich Whitefield had to carry. He had an orphan family of nearly a\r\nhundred persons to maintain; was above a thousand pounds in debt for\r\nthem; and was threatened with arrest on account of a bill for £350,\r\ndrawn, in favour of the orphan house by his dead friend, William\r\nSeward, but which had not been met by him. James Hutton, who had been\r\nhis publisher, refused to have any further transactions with him.\r\n“Many of my spiritual children,” he writes, “who, when I last left\r\nEngland, would have plucked out their own eyes to have given me, are\r\nso prejudiced by the dear Messrs. Wesleys’ dressing up of election in\r\nsuch horrible colours, that they will neither hear, see, nor give me\r\nthe least assistance. Yea, some of them send threatening letters, that\r\nGod will speedily destroy me. As for the people of the world, they\r\nare so embittered by my _injudicious_ and _too severe_ expressions\r\nagainst Archbishop Tillotson, the author of the old Duty of Man, that\r\nthey fly from me as from a viper; and, what is worst of all, I am\r\nnow constrained, on account of our differing in principles, publicly\r\nto separate from my dear, dear old friends, Messrs. John and Charles\r\nWesley.”[393]\r\n\r\nDuring his passage to England, Whitefield wrote to Charles Wesley as\r\nfollows: “My dear, dear brother, why did you throw out the bone of\r\ncontention? Why did _you_ print that sermon against predestination?\r\nWhy did you, in particular, affix your hymn and join in putting out\r\nyour late hymn-book? How can you say you will not dispute with me about\r\nelection, and yet print such hymns?” And then he proceeds to state,\r\nthat he had written an answer to Wesley’s sermon on free grace, and was\r\nabout to have it printed in Charlestown, Boston, and London.[394]\r\n\r\nAbout six weeks before his arrival in England, some one obtained a\r\ncopy of the letter he had sent to Wesley, under the date of September\r\n25, 1740,[395] (an extract of which is given in the previous chapter,\r\npage 316,) and had printed it without either his or Wesley’s consent,\r\nand circulated it gratuitously at the doors of the Foundery. Wesley\r\nheard of this; and, having procured a copy, tore it in pieces before\r\nthe assembled congregation, declaring that he believed Whitefield would\r\nhave done the same. The congregation imitated their minister’s example,\r\nand, in two minutes, all the copies were literally torn to tatters.\r\n\r\nThree weeks after this, Wesley had to hurry off to Kingswood to allay\r\nthe turmoils there. He met the bands, but it was a cold uncomfortable\r\nmeeting. Cennick and fifteen or twenty of his friends had an interview\r\nwith Wesley, who accused them of speaking against him behind his\r\nback. They replied that they had said nothing behind his back which\r\nthey would not say before his face; namely, that he preached up the\r\nfaithfulness of man, and not the faithfulness of God.\r\n\r\nAfter a lovefeast, held in Bristol on Sunday evening, February 22,\r\nWesley related to the Bristol Methodists, that many of their brethren\r\nat Kingswood had formed themselves into a separate society, on account\r\nof Cennick preaching doctrines different to those preached by himself\r\nand his brother. Cennick, who was present, affirmed, that Wesley’s\r\ndoctrine was false. Wesley charged him with supplanting him in his own\r\nhouse, stealing the hearts of the people, and, by private accusations,\r\ndividing very friends. Cennick replied, “I have never privately accused\r\nyou.” Wesley, who, by some means, was possessed of a letter which\r\nCennick had recently addressed to Whitefield, answered: “My brethren,\r\njudge;” and then began to read as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “_January 17, 1741._\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR BROTHER,—That you might come quickly, I have written\r\n    a second time. I sit solitary, like Eli, waiting what will\r\n    become of the ark. My trouble increases daily. How glorious did\r\n    the gospel seem once to flourish in Kingswood! I spake of the\r\n    everlasting love of Christ with sweet power; but now brother\r\n    Charles is suffered to open his mouth against this truth,\r\n    while the frighted sheep gaze and fly, as if no shepherd was\r\n    among them. O, pray for the distressed lambs yet left in this\r\n    place, that they faint not! Brother Charles pleases the world\r\n    with universal redemption, and brother John follows him in\r\n    everything. No atheist can preach more against predestination\r\n    than they; and all who believe election are counted enemies to\r\n    God, and called so. Fly, dear brother. I am as alone; I am in\r\n    the midst of the plague. If God give thee leave, make haste.”\r\n\r\nCennick acknowledged the letter was his, that it had been sent to\r\nWhitefield, and that he retracted nothing in it. The meeting got\r\nexcited, and Wesley adjourned the settlement of the business to\r\nKingswood on Saturday next ensuing.\r\n\r\nHere he heard all that any one wished to say, and then read the\r\nfollowing paper:—\r\n\r\n    “BY many witnesses, it appears that several members of the\r\n    band society in Kingswood have made it their common practice\r\n    to scoff at the preaching of Mr. John and Charles Wesley;\r\n    that they have censured and spoken evil of them behind their\r\n    backs, at the very time they professed love and esteem to their\r\n    faces; that they have studiously endeavoured to prejudice other\r\n    members of that society against them; and, in order thereto,\r\n    have belied and slandered them in divers instances.\r\n\r\n    “Therefore, not for their opinions, nor for any of them\r\n    (whether they be right or wrong), but for the causes above\r\n    mentioned, viz. for their scoffing at the word and ministers of\r\n    God, for their talebearing, backbiting, and evil speaking, for\r\n    their dissembling, lying, and slandering:\r\n\r\n    “I, John Wesley, by the consent and approbation of the band\r\n    society in Kingswood, do declare the persons above mentioned\r\n    to be no longer members thereof. Neither will they be so\r\n    accounted, until they shall openly confess their fault, and\r\n    thereby do what in them lies, to remove the scandal they have\r\n    given.”\r\n\r\nThis is a remarkable document It was hardly two years since Whitefield\r\nand Wesley began to preach at Kingswood, and yet here we have a large\r\nnumber of their converts charged with backbiting, lying, slandering,\r\nand other crimes. “How is the gold become dim!” Were the former days\r\nbetter than these? We doubt it.\r\n\r\nHere we also have the first Methodist expulsion; not for opinions, but\r\nfor sins; not by the sole authority and act of John Wesley, but “by the\r\nconsent and approbation” of the society, whose refractory members were\r\nto be put away. Such was Methodism, at its beginning.\r\n\r\nCennick, and those who sympathised with his sentiments, refused\r\nto own that they had done aught amiss; and declared that, on many\r\noccasions, he had heard both Wesley and his brother preach Popery.\r\nWesley gave them another week to think the matter over. They were still\r\nintractable; and alleged that the _real_ cause of their expulsion was\r\ntheir holding the doctrine of election. Wesley answered, “You know in\r\nyour conscience it is not. There are several predestinarians in our\r\nsocieties both at London and Bristol, nor did I ever put any one out\r\nof either because he held that opinion.” The result of the whole was,\r\nCennick and fifty-one others at once withdrew, and the remainder,\r\nnumbering about a hundred, still adhered to Wesley.[396]\r\n\r\nSuch was the first schism in Methodist history,—John Cennick the\r\nleader,—fifty of the Kingswood members its abettors,—and John Wesley\r\nand a majority of the Kingswood society, the court enacting their\r\nexpulsion.\r\n\r\nThe writer’s chief object is to furnish facts, and therefore he\r\nrefrains from comment on these transactions. No doubt Cennick was\r\nsincere. After the risks he ran in preaching Christ, no one can doubt\r\nhis Christian earnestness: but, having come to Kingswood at Wesley’s\r\ninvitation, and having been employed by him as the teacher of his\r\nschool, and also as an evangelist among the surrounding colliers, it\r\nwould, at least, have been more courteous to have quietly retired from\r\nhis present sphere of action, when he found his views different from\r\nthose of his patron and his friend, than it was for him to pursue the\r\ncontroversial and divisive course he did. John Cennick had a lion’s\r\ncourage and a martyr’s piety; but his passions sometimes mastered his\r\nprudence, and, for want of the serpent’s wisdom, he often failed in\r\nexhibiting the meekness of the dove.\r\n\r\nWhitefield arrived in London a few days after the Kingswood expulsion;\r\nand Wesley, on the 25th of March, hastened off to meet him. Whitefield\r\ntold him they preached two different gospels, and that he was resolved\r\nto preach against him and his brother wherever he preached at all. A\r\nweekly publication, of four folio pages, entitled “The Weekly History;\r\nor An Account of the most remarkable Particulars relating to the\r\npresent Progress of the Gospel,” was immediately started by J. Lewis,\r\nWhitefield promising to supply him with fresh matter every week. This\r\nwas really the first Methodist newspaper ever published. Of course,\r\nCalvinism was its inspiring genius. The principal contributors were\r\nWhitefield, Cennick, Howel Harris, and Joseph Humphreys.\r\n\r\nThe last mentioned was employed by Wesley as a sort of Moravian lay\r\npreacher, as early as the year 1738,[397] and was greatly attached to\r\nhim. At this period, he was acting as Moravian minister at Deptford,\r\nand wrote to Wesley as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “DEPTFORD, _April 5, 1741_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR AND REVEREND SIR,—I think I love you better than ever.\r\n    I would not grieve you by any means, if I could possibly help\r\n    it. I think I had never more power in preaching than I had\r\n    this morning. And, if this is the consequence of electing\r\n    everlasting love, may my soul be ever filled with it!”[398]\r\n\r\nIn another letter, of three weeks later date, addressed to “Mr. M——,”\r\nhe avows his belief in the doctrine of final perseverance, and proceeds\r\nto say:—\r\n\r\n    “The doctrine of sinless perfection in this life, I utterly\r\n    renounce. I believe the preaching of it has led many souls\r\n    into darkness and confusion. I believe those that hold it,\r\n    if children of God at all, are in a very legal state. I\r\n    believe those who pretend to have attained it are dangerously\r\n    ignorant of their own hearts. I also see that, if I incline\r\n    towards universal redemption any longer, I must also hold with\r\n    universal salvation.”\r\n\r\nHe then adds: “Last Saturday I sent the following letter to the Rev.\r\nMr. J. Wesley.”\r\n\r\n    “REVEREND SIR,—I would have been joined with you to all\r\n    eternity if I could; but my having continued with you so long\r\n    as I have has led me into grievous temptation; and I now think\r\n    it my duty no longer to join with you, but openly to renounce\r\n    your peculiar doctrines. I have begun to do it at London; and,\r\n    as the Lord shall enable me, will proceed to do it here at\r\n    Bristol. I feel no bitterness in my spirit, but love you, pray\r\n    for you, and respect you.\r\n\r\n    “I am, sir, your humble servant and unworthy brother,\r\n    “JOSEPH HUMPHREYS.”\r\n\r\nThe above letter was sent to the editor of the _Weekly History_ by\r\nWhitefield, accompanied by the following note:—\r\n\r\n    “I would have you print this letter with my last. If you\r\n    think it best, I would also have it printed in the _Daily\r\n    Advertiser_. I see the mystery of iniquity, that is working,\r\n    more and more.\r\n\r\n    “Ever yours,\r\n    “G. WHITEFIELD.“[399]\r\n\r\nHumphreys and Cennick were now both at Kingswood, which was, for the\r\ntime being, the head quarters of the Calvinistic schism. Here, in the\r\nmonth of April, the separatists got, from an old man, his copy of\r\nWesley’s treatise against predestination, and burnt it.[400] About\r\nthe same time, however, Wesley distributed a thousand copies among\r\nWhitefield’s congregation, and a thousand more at the Foundery;[401]\r\nand, in the same month, addressed the following characteristic letter\r\nto his friend.[402]\r\n\r\n    “_April, 1741._\r\n\r\n    “Would you have me deal plainly with you? I believe you would;\r\n    then, by the grace of God, I will.\r\n\r\n    “Of many things I find you are not rightly informed; of others\r\n    you speak what you have not well weighed.\r\n\r\n    “‘The society room at Bristol,’ you say, ‘ is adorned,’ How?\r\n    Why, with a piece of green cloth nailed to the desk; and two\r\n    sconces for eight candles each in the middle. I know no more.\r\n    Now, which of these can be spared I know not; nor would I\r\n    desire more adorning, or less.\r\n\r\n    “But ‘lodgings are made for me and my brother,’ That is, in\r\n    plain English, there is a little room by the school, where I\r\n    speak to the persons who come to me; and a garret, in which a\r\n    bed is placed for me. And do you grudge me this? Is this the\r\n    voice of my brother, my son, Whitefield?\r\n\r\n    “You say further, ‘that the children at Bristol are clothed\r\n    as well as taught,’ I am sorry for it, for the cloth is not\r\n    paid for yet, and was bought without my consent, or knowledge.\r\n    ‘But those at Kingswood have been neglected,’ This is not so,\r\n    notwithstanding the heavy debt that lay upon it. One master and\r\n    one mistress have been in the house ever since it was capable\r\n    of receiving them. A second master has been placed there some\r\n    months since; and I have long been seeking for two proper\r\n    mistresses; so that as much has been done, as matters stand, if\r\n    not more, than I can answer to God and man.\r\n\r\n    “Hitherto, then, there is no ground for the heavy charge\r\n    of perverting your design for the poor colliers. Two years\r\n    since, your design was to build them a school. To this end,\r\n    you collected some money more than once; how much I cannot\r\n    say, till I have my papers. But this I know, it was not near\r\n    one-half of what has been expended on the work. This design you\r\n    then recommended to me, and I pursued it with all my might,\r\n    through such a train of difficulties as, I will be bold to\r\n    say, you have not met with in your life. For many months, I\r\n    collected money wherever I was, and began building, though\r\n    I had not then a quarter of the money requisite to finish.\r\n    However, taking all the debt upon myself, the creditors were\r\n    willing to stay; and then it was that I took possession of it\r\n    in my own name; that is, when the foundation was laid; and I\r\n    immediately made my will, fixing you and my brother to succeed\r\n    me therein.\r\n\r\n    “But it is a poor case, that you and I should be talking thus.\r\n    Indeed, these things ought not to be. It lay in your power to\r\n    have prevented all, and yet to have borne testimony to what you\r\n    call ‘the truth.’ If you had disliked my sermon, you might have\r\n    printed another on the same text, and have answered my proofs,\r\n    without mentioning my name; this had been fair and friendly.”\r\n\r\nThe two friends were thus at variance; but every candid reader must\r\nhonestly acknowledge, that Wesley triumphantly refutes Whitefield’s\r\npetulant objections.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Whitefield’s adherents in the metropolis, within a few\r\ndays after his arrival, set to work to erect him a wooden building\r\nnear the Foundery, which they called “a Tabernacle, for morning’s\r\nexposition.”[403] On April 25, he went to Bristol, where Charles\r\nWesley was officiating; and, three weeks after, wrote to a friend,\r\nsaying, “The doctrines of the gospel are sadly run down, and most\r\nmonstrous errors propagated. They assert, ‘that the very in-being of\r\nsin must be taken out of us, or otherwise we are not new creatures,’\r\nHowever, at Bristol, error is in a great measure put a stop to.”[404]\r\n\r\nSo Whitefield thought, and yet, at this very time, Charles Wesley was\r\npreaching at Bristol and Kingswood, if possible, with greater power\r\nthan ever. In June, however, Whitefield began to collect money for a\r\nrival meeting-house at Kingswood, and wished John Cennick to lay the\r\nfoundation immediately, but to take care not to make the building\r\neither too large or too handsome.[405]\r\n\r\nWesley and Whitefield were divided; but Howel Harris, with his warm\r\nWelsh heart, tried to reunite them. In the month of October, Harris\r\nhad loving interviews with both Wesley and his brother, and wrote to\r\nWhitefield, then in Scotland. Whitefield, easily moved in the path of\r\nChristian love, immediately addressed to Wesley the letter following:—\r\n\r\n    “ABERDEEN, _October 10, 1741_.\r\n\r\n    “REVEREND AND DEAR BROTHER,—This morning I received a letter\r\n    from brother Harris, telling me how he had conversed with\r\n    you and your dear brother. May God remove all obstacles that\r\n    now prevent our union! Though I hold particular election,\r\n    yet I offer Jesus freely to every individual soul. You may\r\n    carry sanctification to what degrees you will, only I cannot\r\n    agree with you that the in-being of sin is to be destroyed\r\n    in this life. In about three weeks, I hope to be at Bristol.\r\n    May all disputings cease, and each of us talk of nothing but\r\n    Jesus and Him crucified! This is my resolution. I am, without\r\n    dissimulation,\r\n\r\n    “Ever yours,\r\n    “G. WHITEFIELD.”[406]\r\n\r\nIt was nearly two years after this that Wesley wrote the piece, in his\r\ncollected works, entitled, “Calvinistic Controversy” (vol. xiii., p.\r\n478). He says:—\r\n\r\n“Having found for some time a strong desire to unite with Mr.\r\nWhitefield, as far as possible, to cut off needless dispute, I wrote\r\ndown my sentiments, as plain as I could, in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n“There are three points in debate: 1. Unconditional election. 2.\r\nIrresistible grace. 3. Final perseverance.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to the first, Wesley expresses his belief, that God has\r\nunconditionally elected certain persons to do certain work, and certain\r\nnations to receive peculiar privileges; and allows, though he says\r\nhe cannot prove, that God “has unconditionally elected some persons,\r\nthence eminently styled ‘the elect,’ to eternal glory;” but he cannot\r\nbelieve, that all those, not thus elected to glory, must perish\r\neverlastingly; or, that there is a soul on earth but what has the\r\nchance of escaping eternal damnation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to irresistible grace, he believes, that the grace which\r\nbrings faith, and, thereby, salvation, is irresistible at that moment;\r\nand, that most believers may remember a time when God irresistibly\r\nconvinced them of sin, and other times when He acted irresistibly upon\r\ntheir souls; but he also believes, that the grace of God, both before\r\nand after these moments, may be, and hath been resisted; and that, in\r\ngeneral, it does not act irresistibly, but we may comply therewith, or\r\nmay not. In those eminently styled “the elect” (if such there be), the\r\ngrace of God is so far irresistible, that they cannot but believe, and\r\nbe finally saved; but it is not true, that all those must be damned\r\nin whom it does not thus irresistibly work, or, that there is a soul\r\nliving who has not any other grace than such as was designed of God to\r\nincrease his damnation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to final perseverance, he believes, “that there is a state\r\nattainable in this life, from which a man cannot finally fall; and that\r\nhe has attained this, who can say, ‘Old things are passed away; all\r\nthings in me are become new;’ and, further, he does not deny, that all\r\nthose eminently styled ‘the elect’ will infallibly persevere to the\r\nend.”[407]\r\n\r\nIn reference to “the elect,” Henry Moore adds, that Wesley told him,\r\nthat, when he wrote this, he believed, with Macarius, that all who are\r\nperfected in love are thus elect.\r\n\r\nThe document from which the above is taken, was written in 1743. As\r\nMr. Jackson says, it “evidently leans too much towards Calvinism.”\r\nIt is valuable chiefly because it shows Wesley’s anxiety to be at\r\npeace with Whitefield. The latter writes as though all the blame, in\r\nreference to the rupture in their friendship, lay with Wesley; whereas\r\nthis was far from being true. Wesley honestly and firmly believed\r\nthe doctrine of general redemption; and, because he preached it, and\r\npublished a sermon in condemnation of the doctrines opposed to it,\r\nWhitefield worked himself into a fume, and wrote his pamphlet, in which\r\nhe not only tries to refute Wesley’s teaching, but unnecessarily makes\r\na personal attack on Wesley’s character, and taunts him about casting\r\nlots,—a wanton outrage, for which, in October, 1741, he humbly begged\r\nhis pardon.[408] The intolerant, excessive zeal was altogether on the\r\nside of Whitefield. Wesley believed and preached general redemption;\r\nbut raised no objection to Whitefield believing and preaching election\r\nand final perseverance. Instead of reciprocating this, Whitefield,\r\nin his pamphlet, blustered; and, in his letters, whined, until the\r\ndifference of opinion disturbed their friendship, and led them to\r\nbuild separate chapels, form separate societies, and pursue, to\r\nthe end of life, separate lines of action. One of Wesley’s friends\r\nwished him to reply to Whitefield’s pamphlet. Wesley answered, “You\r\nmay read Whitefield against Wesley; but you shall never read Wesley\r\nagainst Whitefield.”[409] In private, Wesley opposed Whitefield, but\r\nin public never. On one occasion, when the two friends met in a large\r\nsocial gathering, Whitefield mounted his hobby, and spoke largely and\r\nvaliantly in defence of his favourite system. Wesley, on the other\r\nhand, was silent till all the company were gone, when, turning to the\r\nspurred and belted controversial knight, he quietly remarked, “Brother,\r\nare you aware of what you have done to-night?” “Yes,” said Whitefield,\r\n“I have defended truth.” “You have tried to prove,” replied Wesley,\r\n“that God is worse than the devil; for the devil can only _tempt_ a man\r\nto sin; but, if what you have said be true, God _forces_ a man to sin;\r\nand therefore, on your own system, God is worse than the devil.”[410]\r\n\r\nThus the gulf between Wesley and Whitefield was immense. “It was\r\nundesirable—indeed, it was impossible—that they should continue to\r\naddress, in turn, the same congregations; for such congregations would\r\nhave been kept in the pitiable condition of a ship, thrown on its beam\r\nends, larboard and starboard, by hurricanes driving alternately east\r\nand west.”[411]\r\n\r\nBeing separated from Whitefield and the Moravians, Wesley began to\r\npurge and to organise the societies, which were now purely and properly\r\nhis own. At Bristol, he took an account of every person—(1) to whom\r\nany reasonable objection was made; and (2) who was not known to and\r\nrecommended by some, on whose veracity he could depend. To those who\r\nwere sufficiently recommended, he gave tickets. Most of the rest he\r\nhad face to face with their accusers; and such as appeared to be\r\ninnocent, or confessed their faults and promised better behaviour,\r\nwere then received into the society. The others were put upon trial\r\nagain, unless they voluntarily expelled themselves. By this purging\r\nprocess, about forty were excluded.[412] He also appointed stewards,\r\nto receive and expend what was contributed weekly; and, finding the\r\nfunds insufficient, he discharged two of the Bristol schoolmasters,\r\nretaining still, at Kingswood and Bristol unitedly, three masters and\r\ntwo mistresses for the two schools respectively.\r\n\r\nIn London, he adopted the same process, and set apart the hours from\r\nten to two, on every day but Saturday, for speaking with the bands and\r\nother persons, that no disorderly walker, nor any of a careless or\r\ncontentious spirit, might remain among them; the result of which was\r\nthe society was reduced to about a thousand members.[413] Ascertaining\r\nthat many of the members were without needful food, and destitute\r\nof convenient clothing, he appointed twelve persons to visit every\r\nalternate day, and to provide things needful for the sick; also to\r\nmeet once a week to give an account of their proceedings, and to\r\nconsult what could be done further. Women, out of work, he proposed\r\nto employ in knitting, giving them the common price for the work they\r\ndid, and then adding gratuities according to their needs. To meet\r\nthese expenses, he requested those who could afford it, to give a penny\r\nweekly, and to contribute any clothing which their own use did not\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nHere we have a new Methodist agency employed. Wesley had already\r\npermitted laymen to exhort and preach; he now authorised them to\r\npay pastoral visits among his people. At present, they were _mere\r\nvisitors_, and meetings analogous to the class-meetings of the present\r\nday did not exist. The two Wesleys often addressed the societies apart,\r\nafter they had dismissed the general congregation. They also fixed\r\ncertain hours for private conversation; and now they appointed visitors\r\nto visit those who through sickness, poverty, or other causes, were\r\nnot able to avail themselves of such assistance. This, as yet, was\r\nall. In the present sense, bands and classes there were none, except\r\nthat each society, after the manner of the Moravians, was divided into\r\nmale and female, and, perhaps, married and unmarried, bands, all of\r\nthem watched over by Wesley or by his brother; and the sick and poor\r\namong them visited by persons appointed to that office. In Bristol,\r\nseveral members applied to Wesley for baptism, and he gave the bishop\r\nnotice to that effect, adding, that they desired him to baptize them\r\nby immersion.[414] The Kingswood society, having been repelled from\r\nthe sacramental table at Temple church, Charles Wesley gave them the\r\nsacrament in their own humble school; and, notwithstanding his high\r\nchurchism, declared that, under the circumstances, if they had not had\r\nthe school, he should have felt himself justified in administering\r\nit in the wood. In London, some of the members communicated at St.\r\nPaul’s, or at their own parish churches; but, during the autumn, on\r\nfive successive Sundays, Wesley availed himself of the offer of Mr.\r\nDeleznot, a French clergyman, and used his small church, in Hermitage\r\nStreet, Wapping, in administering the Lord’s supper to five successive\r\nbatches of about two hundred members of his society (as many as the\r\nplace could well contain), until all the society, consisting of about a\r\nthousand persons, had received it.[415]\r\n\r\nTo the members at Bristol, and doubtless also at London, Wesley\r\ngave _tickets_. On every ticket he wrote, with his own hand, the\r\nmember’s name, “so that,” says he, “the ticket implied as strong a\r\nrecommendation of the person to whom it was given as if I had wrote at\r\nlength, ‘I believe the bearer hereof to be one that fears God and works\r\nrighteousness.’”\r\n\r\nWesley regarded these tickets as being equivalent to the επιστολαι\r\nσυστατικαι, “commendatory letters,” mentioned by the apostle, and\r\nsays they were of use: (1) because, wherever those who bore them\r\ncame, they were acknowledged by their brethren, and received with all\r\ncheerfulness; (2) when the societies had to meet apart, the tickets\r\neasily distinguished who were members and who were not; (3) they\r\nsupplied a quiet and inoffensive method of removing any disorderly\r\nmember; for, the tickets being changed once a quarter, and, of course,\r\nno new ticket being given to such a person, it was hereby immediately\r\nknown that he was no longer a member of the community.[416]\r\n\r\nThe writer is possessed of nearly a complete set of these society\r\ntickets, from the first, issued about 1742, to those given a hundred\r\nyears afterwards. Many of them bear the autographs of John and Charles\r\nWesley, William Grimshaw, and other old Methodist worthies. The\r\nearliest are wood and copper-plate engravings, printed on cardboard,\r\nwithout any text of Scripture: some bearing the emblem of an angel\r\nflying in the clouds of heaven, with one trumpet to his mouth, and a\r\nsecond in his hand; and others of the Sun of Righteousness shining on a\r\nphœnix rising out of fire. Some have a dove encircled with glory; and\r\nothers have no engraving whatever, but simply an inscription, written\r\nby Charles Wesley, “August, 1746.” Some merely have the word “Society”\r\nimprinted, with the member’s name written underneath; others have a\r\nlamb carrying a flag; and others a tree with a broken stem, Jehovah\r\nas a sun shining on it, and at its foot two men, one planting a new\r\ncutting, and the other watering one already planted. Some represent\r\nChrist in the clouds of heaven, with the cross in one hand and a crown\r\nin the other; and others represent the Christian kneeling before an\r\naltar, inscribed with the words, “Pray always and faint not.” One\r\nrepresents Christ as washing a disciple’s feet; and another, with\r\na text of Scripture at the top, has four lines below, in which are\r\nprinted, “March 25, June 25, September 29, December 25,” with space\r\nleft opposite to each for writing the member’s name, and so making one\r\nticket serve for the four quarters of a year. One bears the impress\r\nof an anchor and a crown; and another the image of old father Time,\r\nhurrying along, with a scroll in his hand, inscribed with “Now is the\r\naccepted time.” Some are printed with black ink, some with red, and\r\nsome with blue. About 1750, emblems gave place to texts of Scripture,\r\nwhich have been continued from that time to this.\r\n\r\nThe Methodist societies, as organised by Wesley, were thus fairly\r\nstarted in 1741. Meanwhile, Methodism on earth began to swell the\r\ninhabitants of heaven. At the very commencement of the year, Elizabeth\r\nDavis, of London, after she was speechless, being desired to hold up\r\nher hand if she knew she was going to God, immediately held up both.\r\nAnne Cole, on being asked by Wesley, whether she chose to live or die,\r\nanswered: “I choose neither, I choose nothing. I am in my Saviour’s\r\nhands, and I have no will but His.” Another of the London members, when\r\nvisited by Wesley, said: “I am very ill,—but I am very well. O, I am\r\nhappy, happy, happy! My spirit continually rejoices in God my Saviour.\r\nLife or death is all one to me. I have no darkness, no cloud. My body\r\nindeed is weak and in pain, but my soul is all joy and praise.” Jane\r\nMuncy exclaimed: “I faint not, I murmur not, I rejoice evermore, and in\r\neverything give thanks. God is ever with me, and I have nothing to do\r\nbut praise Him.” In Bristol, a woman in her dying agonies cried out:\r\n“O, how loving is God to me! But He is loving to every man, and loves\r\nevery soul as well as He loves mine.” The last words of another were,\r\n“Death stares me in the face, but I fear him not.” Hannah Richardson,\r\nwho was followed to her grave by the whole of the Bristol society, the\r\nprocession being pelted in the streets with dirt and stones, said: “I\r\nhave no fear, no doubt, no trouble. Heaven is open! I see Jesus Christ\r\nwith all His angels and saints in white. I see what I cannot utter or\r\nexpress.” Sister Hooper cried, “I am in great pain, but in greater\r\njoy.” Sister Lillington exclaimed, “I never felt such love before;\r\nI love every soul: I am all love, and so is God.” Rachel Peacock\r\nsang hymns incessantly, and was so filled with joy that she shouted:\r\n“Though I groan, I feel no pain at all; Christ so rejoices and fills my\r\nheart.”[417] And to all these may be added Keziah Wesley. In a letter\r\nto his brother, dated March 9, 1741, Charles Wesley writes: “Yesterday\r\nmorning, sister Kezzy died in the Lord Jesus. He finished His work, and\r\ncut it short in mercy. Full of thankfulness, resignation, and love,\r\nwithout pain or trouble, she commended her spirit into the hands of\r\nJesus, and fell asleep.”[418]\r\n\r\nThese were triumphs in the midst of troubles; for, besides the anxiety\r\nand pain arising out of the differences with Whitefield and the\r\nMoravians, Wesley, in 1741, had to encounter no inconsiderable amount\r\nof unprincipled persecution. At Deptford, while he was preaching,\r\n“many poor wretches were got together, utterly devoid both of common\r\nsense and common decency, who cried aloud, as if just come from ‘among\r\nthe tombs.’” In London, on Shrove Tuesday, “many men of the baser\r\nsort” mixed themselves with the female part of his congregation, and\r\nbehaved with great indecency. “A constable commanded them to keep the\r\npeace, in answer to which they knocked him down.” In Long Lane, while\r\nWesley was preaching, the mob pelted him with stones, one of great\r\nsize passing close past his head. In Marylebone fields, in the midst\r\nof his sermon, out of doors, missiles fell thick and fast on every\r\nside. In Charles Square, Hoxton, the rabble brought an ox which they\r\nendeavoured to drive through the congregation. A man, who happened to\r\nbe a Dissenting minister, after hearing him preach at Chelsea, asked,\r\n“_Quid est tibi nomen?_” and, on Wesley not answering his impertinence,\r\nthe pedantic puppy turned in triumph to his friends, and said, “Ah! I\r\ntold you he did not understand Latin.” Among other slanders concerning\r\nhim, it was currently reported that he had paid a fine of £20, for\r\nselling Geneva gin; that he kept in his house two popish priests;\r\nthat he had received large remittances from Spain, in order to make\r\na party among the poor; and that, as soon as the Spaniards landed,\r\nhe was to join them with twenty thousand men. It was also rumoured,\r\nthat, in Bristol, he had hanged himself, and had been cut down just\r\nin time to save his life. The _Scots Magazine_, for August, had a\r\nscurrilous article to the following effect. Above thirty Methodists\r\nhad been in Bedlam, and six were there at present. Wesley had set up,\r\nat his Moorfields meeting-house, a number of spinning wheels, where\r\ngirls who had absconded from their homes, and servants who had been\r\ndischarged for neglecting their master’s business, were set to work,\r\nand were allowed sixpence daily, the overplus of their earnings going\r\ninto Wesley’s pocket. Boys and girls mixed together, and were taught to\r\ncall each other brother and sister in the Lord. They had to greet each\r\nother with a holy kiss, and to show the utmost affection and fondness,\r\nin imitation of the primitive Christians. In the rooms adjoining the\r\nspinning wheels were several beds, and when persons, in the Foundery\r\ncongregation, fell into fits, either pretended or real, they were\r\ncarried out and laid upon these beds, that Wesley might pray the evil\r\nspirits out of them, and the good spirit into them, and thus convert\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn refutation of this tissue of unmingled falsehoods, a writer says,\r\nin the same magazine, that he had visited the Foundery, and found it\r\n“an old open house, like the tennis court at Edinburgh;” but there were\r\nno bedchambers, and no spinning wheels; and, consequently, no runaway\r\ngirls nor discarded menials. And, so far from above thirty Methodists\r\nhaving been sent to Bedlam, the writer had made inquiry in London, and\r\nwas unable to hear of one.[419]\r\n\r\nThe _Gentleman’s Magazine_, for the same year (page 26), has a\r\nridiculous letter, purporting to be from a Methodist to a clergyman,\r\nin which the clergyman is charged with turning “the _Scripters_ upside\r\ndown,” and with calling the Methodists “_expownding infildelfels_.”\r\nAppended to the letter are annotations, stating that, in a certain\r\nbarn, twenty or thirty Methodists rendezvous to hear a young\r\nschoolmaster preach, pray, and sing Wesley’s hymns; and that, recently,\r\na mob of juveniles had chastised his ambition by throwing snowballs\r\nat him; but the preaching pedagogue, instead of ceasing, had cheered\r\nhimself by singing hymns suitable to such adventurers; and a cobbler’s\r\nwife had been so excited by his dissertations upon the pangs of the\r\nnew birth, that she imagined herself pregnant with devils, had been\r\ndelivered of two or three, but still felt others struggling within her.\r\n\r\nThe _Weekly Miscellany_ tells its readers that, in the assemblies of\r\nthe expounding houses, lately erected in the outskirts of London by the\r\nMethodists, any one, who conceits himself inwardly moved, immediately\r\nsets up for a Scripture expounder. In a long article, it pretends to\r\nshow that the Methodist preachers are like the German Anabaptists—1.\r\nBecause they act contrary to the oaths they have taken. 2. Because\r\nof their invectives against the clergy. 3. Because they are against\r\nall rule and authority. 4. Because they let laymen and also women\r\npreach. 5. Because they preach in the streets. 6. Because they denounce\r\nvengeance and damnation against sinners. 7. Because they contend for\r\nabsolute perfection in this life. 8. Because they pretend to be always\r\nguided by the Holy Ghost. And, 9. Because they hold the doctrine of\r\ncommunity of goods.\r\n\r\nThe same abusive but vigorously written paper contains an attack\r\nupon the poor Methodists, by Hooker, the editor, begun in the number\r\nfor March 14, and continued weekly until June 27, when this scolding\r\nperiodical came to a well deserved termination. The following are a few\r\nselections:—\r\n\r\nMarch 28.—Wesley pretends to cast out spirits from those whom he\r\ndeclares possessed of them; but he is “a grand, empty, inconsistent\r\nheretic; the ringleader, fomenter, and first cause of all the\r\ndivisions, separations, factions, and feuds that have happened in\r\nOxford, London, Bristol, and other places where he has been.”\r\n\r\nApril 25.—Wesley rebaptizes adults, on the ground that, _really_ they\r\nhave never been baptized before, the baptism of infants by sprinkling\r\nbeing no true baptism in his esteem. When Whitefield returned from\r\nGeorgia, he preached at the Foundery, taking for his text, “O foolish\r\nGalatians, who hath bewitched you?” For this he was immediately\r\nexcommunicated from the Foundery pulpit, lest the people should think\r\nthat Wesley was a conjuror. “Everybody allows that there are above\r\ntwenty, and some say forty, spinning wheels at the Foundery.” “Wesley\r\nwell knows how to breakfast with one of his devotees, dine with\r\nanother, and sup with a third, all of which retrenches the charges\r\nof housekeeping at home. Those who sit in his gallery must subscribe\r\nfive shillings a quarter, and those who stand, a penny a week. He who\r\nadvances half-a-crown a quarter is admitted into the close society; and\r\nhe who doubles that amount becomes a member of the bands, where men and\r\nwomen stay all night, but for what purpose is known only to God and to\r\nthemselves. The price for resolving cases of conscience is threepence\r\neach. Wesley makes at least £50 by every edition of the hymns he\r\npublishes; and thus, by his preaching, his bookselling, his workhouse,\r\nhis wheedling, and his sponging, it is generally believed that he gets\r\nan income of £700 a year, and some say above £1000. This,” adds the\r\nmendacious editor, “is priest-craft in perfection.”\r\n\r\nMay 9.—The writer speculates concerning what is likely to be the end\r\nof the Methodist movement. 1. Some think if the Methodists are let\r\nalone, they will, as a matter of course, fall to pieces. 2. Others\r\nthink that the irreconcilable differences between Wesley and Whitefield\r\nwill effect their ruin; for Whitefield has set up a conventicle of\r\nboards not far from Wesley’s Foundery; and while one calls the other\r\nschismatic, the other in requital calls him a heretic. 3. Some think\r\nthat their congregations, by neglecting their business and their work,\r\nwill be reduced to beggary, and this, of course, will ruin all. 4.\r\nLastly, others think their conduct will be such that the government\r\nwill find it necessary to suppress them.\r\n\r\nJune 13.—Proposes the erection of a Methodist edifice on Blackheath.\r\nThe foundation stone is to be the tombstone that prevented the\r\nresurrection of Dr. Emes, the famous French prophet. The principal\r\nentrance is to be adorned with statues of the most eminent\r\nfield-preachers. The hall is to be decorated with a piece, in which the\r\nprincipal figure is to be Enthusiasm, sitting in an easy chair, and\r\njust delivered of two beauteous babes, the one called Superstition,\r\nand the other Infidelity. On her right hand must be a grisly old\r\ngentleman with a cloven foot, holding the new born children in a\r\nreceiver, which the Pope has blessed, and gazing upon them with most\r\nfatherly affection. The _pang room_ of the building is to be for the\r\naccommodation of those seized with the pangs of the new birth. All\r\nwho run mad about election must be lodged in the _predestination\r\nroom_,—which, by the way, is likely to be well peopled, and therefore\r\nmust be large, as well as dark and gloomy, and must be adorned with\r\nthe evolutions, intricacies, and involutions of a rusty chain, held\r\nat one end by the Methodistic founder, and at the other by the devil.\r\nThe _disputation room_ is, like a cockpit, to be round as a hoop, so\r\nthat the disputants may have the pleasure of disputing in a circle.\r\nThe _expounding room_ is to be adorned with a picture of the founder,\r\nwith a pair of scissors in one hand and a Bible in the other; a motto\r\nover his reverend head, “Dividing the word of God;” and all round about\r\nscraps of paper supposed to be texts newly clipped from the sacred\r\nScriptures. The _refectory_ is to have a painting to represent Wesley,\r\nWhitefield, and C. Graves at supper, with Madam Bourignon presiding.\r\nNear her must be an ass’s head boiled with sprouts and bacon; and,\r\nat the other end of the table, a dish of owls roasted and larded.\r\nHaving already helped Whitefield to the jaw bone of the ass’s head,\r\nand Wesley to the sweet tooth, she now gives Mr. Graves a spoonful\r\nof the brains and a bit of tongue, which he receives with a grateful\r\nbow. The foundation stone is to be laid on the first of April; and the\r\nprocession to the site are to sing, not the psalms of David, for they\r\nare not half good enough, but a hymn of Wesley’s own composing.\r\n\r\nRidicule like this was even worse than being pelted with brickbats and\r\nrotten eggs.\r\n\r\nThe two Wesleys and Whitefield were often roughly treated; and so\r\nalso was John Cennick, the Methodist Moravian. At Swindon, the mob\r\nsurrounded his congregation, rung a bell, blew a horn, and used a fire\r\nengine in drenching him and them with water. Guns were fired over the\r\npeople’s heads, and rotten eggs were plentiful.[420] At Hampton, near\r\nGloucester, the rabble, chiefly soldiers, to annoy him, beat a drum\r\nand let off squibs and crackers. For an hour and a half, hog’s wash\r\nand fœtid water were poured upon him and his congregation, who all the\r\nwhile stood perfectly still, in secret prayer, with their eyes and\r\nhands lifted up to heaven.[421] At Stratton, a crowd of furious men\r\ncame, armed with weapons, clubs, and staves. Cudgels were used most\r\nunmercifully. Some of his congregation had blood streaming down their\r\nfaces; others, chiefly women, were dragged away by the hair of their\r\nhead. Sylvester Keen spat in the face of Cennick’s sister, and beat\r\nher about the head, as if he meant to kill her. The mob bellowed and\r\nroared like maniacs; but Cennick kept on preaching and praying till he\r\nwas violently pulled down; when he and his friends set out for Lineham,\r\nsinging hymns, and followed by the crowd, who bawled—“You cheating dog,\r\nyou pickpocketing rogue, sell us a halfpenny ballad!”[422]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of such treatment, Methodism went on its way, and\r\nprospered. It is a remarkable fact, that, during 1741, there were no\r\n_stricken_ cases, like those which occurred in 1739, excepting two\r\nat Bristol; but there were many signal seasons of refreshing from\r\nthe presence of the Lord. A man, who had been an atheist for twenty\r\nyears, came to the Foundery to make sport, but was so convinced of sin,\r\nthat he rested not until he found peace with God. At Bristol, on one\r\noccasion, “some wept aloud, some clapped their hands, some shouted, and\r\nthe rest sang praise.” In Charles Square, London, while a violent storm\r\nwas raging, “their hearts danced for joy, praising ‘the glorious God\r\nthat maketh the thunder.’”\r\n\r\nTwo or three other important events, occurring in the year 1741, must\r\nbe noticed.\r\n\r\nAt midsummer, Wesley spent about three weeks in Oxford. Here he\r\ninquired concerning the exercises requisite in order to become a\r\nBachelor in Divinity. The Oxford Methodists were scattered. Out of\r\ntwenty-five or thirty weekly communicants, only two were left; and\r\nnot one continued to attend the daily prayers of the Church. Here he\r\nmet with his old friend, Mr. Gambold, who told him he need be under\r\nno concern respecting his sermon before the university, which he\r\nhad come to preach, for the authorities would be utterly regardless\r\nof what he said. Here also he had a conversation with Richard Viney,\r\noriginally a London tailor, but now the Oxford Moravian minister,—a\r\nman, as James Hutton tells us, whose person, delivery, and bearing\r\nprevented his sermons being acceptable to many, and yet a man, who, in\r\nthis same year, was elected president of the society in Fetter Lane.\r\nUltimately he removed to Broad Oaks, Essex, as the superintendent of\r\nthe Moravian school; then, by casting lots, was condemned as an enemy\r\nof the work of God; and then joined Wesley’s society at Birstal, which\r\nhe so perverted, that they “laughed at all fasting, and self denial,\r\nand family prayer,” and treated even John Nelson slightingly.[423]\r\n\r\nWesley preached his sermon at St. Mary’s, on Saturday, July 25, to\r\none of the largest congregations he had seen in Oxford. His text\r\nwas: “Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian;” and his two\r\ndivisions, (1) what is implied in being _almost_; and (2) what in being\r\n_altogether_, a Christian. The sermon is one of the most faithful that\r\nWesley ever preached. It was printed by W. Strahan, 12mo, pages 21, and\r\nwas sold at twopence.\r\n\r\nIt is almost certain, however, that this was not the sermon that Wesley\r\n_meant_ to preach. After his decease, a mutilated manuscript in English\r\nwas found among his papers, dated “July 24, 1741” (a month before he\r\npreached at Oxford), and also a copy of the same in Latin. This was a\r\ndiscourse on the text, “How is the faithful city become an harlot!”\r\nThere can be no question that the sermon was written with the design\r\nof being delivered before the university, and that, for some reason,\r\nthe design for the present was abandoned. The sermon, if preached, must\r\ninevitably have brought upon the preacher the ire of his hearers. While\r\nadmitting that the university had some who were faithful witnesses of\r\ngospel truth, Wesley alleges that, comparatively speaking, they were\r\nvery few. To say nothing of deists, Arians, and Socinians, some of the\r\nchief champions of the faith were far from being faultless. Tillotson\r\nhad published several sermons expressly to prove that, not _faith\r\nalone_, but _good works_, are necessary in order to justification; and\r\nthe great Bishop Bull had taken the same position. Wesley then proceeds\r\nto attack the members of the university in a way, perhaps, not the most\r\nprudent. He asks if it is not a fact, that many of them “believe that a\r\ngood moral man, and a good Christian, mean the same?” He continues:—\r\n\r\n    “Scarcely is the form of godliness seen among us. Take any one\r\n    you meet; take a second, a third, a fourth, or the twentieth.\r\n    Not one of them has even the appearance of a saint, any more\r\n    than of an angel. Is there no needless visiting on the sabbath\r\n    day? no trifling, no impertinence of conversation? And, on\r\n    other days, are not the best of our conversing hours spent in\r\n    foolish talking and jesting, nay, perhaps, in wanton talking\r\n    too? Are there not many among us found to eat and drink with\r\n    the drunken? Are not even the hours assigned for study too\r\n    commonly employed in reading plays, novels, and idle tales? How\r\n    many voluntary blockheads there are among us, whose ignorance\r\n    is not owing to incapacity, but to mere laziness! How few, of\r\n    the vast number, who have it in their power, are truly learned\r\n    men! Who is there that can be said to understand Hebrew? Might\r\n    I not say, or even Greek? O what is so scarce as learning, save\r\n    religion!”[424]\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this remarkable sermon is in the same strain. Its\r\nallegations, we are afraid, were true; but the sermon was far too\r\npersonal to be prudent, and Wesley exercised a wise discretion in\r\nexchanging it for the other.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1741, while in Wales, Wesley was seized with a serious\r\nillness. Hastening to Bristol, he was ordered, by Dr. Middleton, to go\r\nto bed,—“a strange thing to me,” he writes, “who have not kept my bed\r\na day for five-and-thirty years.” A dangerous fever followed, and the\r\nBristol society held a fast and offered prayer. For eight days, he hung\r\nbetween life and death; and, for three weeks, he was kept a prisoner,\r\nwhen, contrary to the advice given him, he resumed his work, and began\r\nto preach daily.\r\n\r\nThis was a long interval of enforced retirement for a man of Wesley’s\r\nactive temperament; but it was not unprofitably spent. As soon as\r\nhe could, he began to read, and during his convalescence devoured\r\nhalf-a-dozen works. He read “the life of that truly good and great man,\r\nMr. Philip Henry;” and “the life of Mr. Matthew Henry,—a man not to\r\nbe despised, either as a scholar or a Christian, though not equal to\r\nhis father.” He read “Mr. Laval’s ‘History of the Reformed Churches in\r\nFrance;’ full of the most amazing instances of the wickedness of men,\r\nand of the goodness and power of God.” He likewise read “Turretin’s\r\n‘History of the Church,’ a dry, heavy, barren treatise.” He gave a\r\nsecond perusal to “Theologia Germanica,” and asks, “O, how was it that\r\nI could ever so admire the affected obscurity of this unscriptural\r\nwriter?” He also “read again, with great surprise, part of the\r\n‘Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius,’” and says, “so weak, credulous,\r\nthoroughly injudicious a writer have I seldom found.”\r\n\r\nAmong the pamphlets published against Wesley, during 1741, was one\r\nentitled: “The Perfectionists Examined; or, Inherent Perfection in\r\nthis Life, no Scripture Doctrine. By William Fleetwood, Gent.” 8vo, 99\r\npages. Fleetwood asserts that, of all the open and professed enemies of\r\nthe gospel, the Methodists are the worst; “they are more destructive\r\nto religion than the papists or Mahometans;” “by their artful\r\ninsinuations, and outward sanctity, they have drawn numbers of _silly\r\nwomen_ after them; they plainly show themselves to be some of those of\r\nwhom the apostle Peter prophesied, ‘Such as bring in damnable heresies,\r\ndenying the Lord that bought them’”; “and are more like _French_\r\nenthusiasts, or rank papists, than true Christians.” The reader must\r\nguess the rest.\r\n\r\nAnother opponent was Joseph Hart, who published a small work on “The\r\nUnreasonableness of Religion, being Remarks and Animadversions on Mr.\r\nJohn Wesley’s Sermon on Romans viii. 32.” Of all the enemies Wesley\r\nhad, Joseph Hart was one of the most persisting, for he scarcely ever\r\npreached without endeavouring, more or less, to explode Wesley’s\r\ndoctrines, as tending to lead the people into dangerous delusions.[425]\r\n\r\nAnother pamphlet, octavo, 75 pages, published during the year 1741, was\r\nentitled: “The Doctrine of Justification by Faith, stated according\r\nto the Articles of the Church of England. By Arthur Bedford, M.A.,\r\nChaplain to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales.” This was written\r\nat the request of “a member of the religious societies in London,” who\r\ntold the author, that, “there had been great disputes among them lately\r\nconcerning this doctrine; some having advanced faith so high, as to\r\nmake no necessity of a good life; and others having advanced works so\r\nhigh, as to make faith to consist only in a general belief, that the\r\nNew Testament is the word of God.” The pamphlet is an able production,\r\nand is temperately written. To most of its sentiments, Wesley himself\r\nwould have raised no objection.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to notice Wesley’s own publications during 1741.[426]\r\n\r\nProbably the first was his sermon, entitled, “Christian Perfection.” He\r\nwrites: “I think it was in the latter end of the year 1740, that I had\r\na conversation with Dr. Gibson, then bishop of London, at Whitehall. He\r\nasked me what I meant by perfection. I told him without any disguise\r\nor reserve. When I ceased speaking, he said, ‘Mr. Wesley, if this be\r\nall you mean, publish it to all the world,’ I answered, ‘My lord, I\r\nwill’; and accordingly wrote and published the sermon on Christian\r\nperfection.”[427]\r\n\r\nThe two divisions of this important sermon are: (1) in what sense\r\nChristians _are not_, and (2) in what sense they _are_, _perfect_.\r\nWesley shows that no one is so perfect in this life, as to be free\r\nfrom ignorance, from mistakes, from infirmities, and from temptations.\r\nOn the other hand, he proves that the perfect Christian is freed from\r\noutward sin; from evil thoughts; and from evil tempers. The sermon is\r\nelaborate, and has affixed to it Charles Wesley’s hymn on “The Promise\r\nof Sanctification,” consisting of twenty-eight stanzas, and beginning\r\nwith the line,—“God of all power, and truth, and grace.”\r\n\r\nAnother of Wesley’s publications was, “A Collection of Psalms and\r\nHymns.” Hitherto, all the hymn-books, except the first, had borne, on\r\nthe title-page, the names of both the brothers; but this has the name\r\nof Wesley only.\r\n\r\nA third was, “A Dialogue between a Predestinarian and his Friend.”\r\n12mo, eight pages. The object of this short tract is to show,\r\nfrom the writings of Piscator, Calvin, Zanchius, and others, that\r\npredestinarianism teaches, that God causes reprobates to sin, and\r\ncreates them on purpose to be damned.[428]\r\n\r\nBesides the above, Wesley published four abridgments from other works.\r\n\r\n1. “The Scripture Doctrine concerning Predestination, Election, and\r\nReprobation.” 12mo, 16 pages.\r\n\r\n2. “Serious Considerations on Absolute Predestination.” 12mo, 24 pages.\r\nThe tract proves, that the doctrine of absolute predestination is\r\nobjectionable: (1) because it makes God the author of sin; (2) because,\r\nit makes Him delight in the death of sinners; (3) because, it is highly\r\ninjurious to Christ our Mediator; (4) because, it makes the preaching\r\nof the gospel a mere mock and illusion; etc.\r\n\r\n3. “An Extract of the Life of Monsieur De Renty, a late Nobleman\r\nof France.” 12mo, pages 67. De Renty usually rose at five o’clock;\r\ncommunicated every day; and spent his time in devotion and doing good.\r\nFor several years he ate but one meal a day, and even that was scanty\r\nand always of the poorest food. He often passed the night in a chair,\r\ninstead of in bed, or would lie down upon a bench in his clothes and\r\nboots. He parted with several books, because richly bound; and carried\r\nno silver about him, but for works of charity. When his mother took\r\nfrom him a large portion of his property, he caused the _Te Deum_ to\r\nbe sung, beginning it himself. He was wont to say, “I carry about with\r\nme ordinarily a plenitude of the presence of the Holy Trinity.” In\r\nvisiting the sick, he would kindle their fires, make their beds, and\r\nset in order their little household stuff. His zeal for the salvation\r\nof men was boundless. “I am ready,” said he, “to serve all men, not\r\nexcepting one, and to lay down my life for any one.” He established\r\nnumbers of societies at Caen and other places, for the purpose of\r\nChristians assisting one another in working out both their own and\r\ntheir neighbours’ salvation. He died at Paris, in the thirty-seventh\r\nyear of his age, on April 24, 1649. De Renty was, in Wesley’s\r\nestimation, a model saint.\r\n\r\n4. The fourth and last abridgment published, in 1741, was entitled,\r\n“Reflections upon the Conduct of Human Life, with reference to Learning\r\nand Knowledge.” 12mo, pages 36. This was extracted from a work written\r\nby Dr. John Norris, an old friend of Wesley’s father, and one of the\r\nprincipal contributors to the _Athenian Gazette_.[429]\r\n\r\nThe tract, throughout, is in a high degree rich and racy, and well\r\nworth reading. It unquestionably contains the great principles which\r\nguided Wesley in all his reading, writing, publishing of books, and\r\neducational efforts in general. He considered all kinds of knowledge\r\nuseful; but, some being much more so than others, he devoted to them\r\ntime and attention accordingly; and made the whole subordinate to the\r\ngreat purpose of human existence,—the glory of God, and the happiness\r\nof man. We finish the present chapter with a few sentences culled from\r\nthe conclusion of this threepenny production:—\r\n\r\n    “I cannot, with any patience, reflect, that, out of so short a\r\n    time as human life, consisting, it may be, of fifty or sixty\r\n    years, nineteen or twenty shall be spent in hammering out a\r\n    little Latin and Greek, and in learning a company of poetical\r\n    fictions and fantastic stories. If one were to judge of the\r\n    life of man by the proportion of it spent at school, one would\r\n    think the antediluvian mark were not yet out. Besides, the\r\n    things taught in seminaries are often frivolous. How many\r\n    excellent and useful things might be learnt, while boys are\r\n    thumbing and murdering Hesiod and Homer? Of what signification\r\n    is such stuff as this, to the accomplishment of a reasonable\r\n    soul? What improvement can it be to my understanding, to\r\n    know the amours of _Pyramus_ and _Thisbe_, or of _Hero_ and\r\n    _Leander_? Let any man but consider human nature, and tell me\r\n    whether he thinks a boy is fit to be trusted with Ovid? And\r\n    yet, to books such as these our youth is dedicated, and in\r\n    these some of us employ our riper years; and, when we die,\r\n    this makes one part of our funeral eulogy; though, according\r\n    to the principles before laid down, we should have been as\r\n    pertinently and more innocently employed all the while, if we\r\n    had been picking straws in Bedlam. The measure of prosecuting\r\n    learning is its usefulness to good life; and, consequently, all\r\n    prosecution of it beyond or beside this end, is impertinent\r\n    and immoderate. For my own part, I am so thoroughly convinced\r\n    of the certainty of the principles here propounded, that I\r\n    look upon myself as under almost a necessity of conducting\r\n    my studies by them, and intend to study nothing at all but\r\n    what serves to the advancement of piety and good life. I have\r\n    spent about thirteen years in the most celebrated university\r\n    in the world, in pursuing both such learning as the academical\r\n    standard requires, and as my private genius inclined me to; but\r\n    I intend to spend my uncertain remainder of time in studying\r\n    only what makes for the moral improvement of my mind, and the\r\n    regulation of my life. More particularly, I shall apply myself\r\n    to read such books as are rather persuasive than instructive;\r\n    such as warm, kindle, and enlarge the affections, and awaken\r\n    the Divine sense in the soul; being convinced, by every day’s\r\n    experience, that I have more need of heat than light; though\r\n    were I for more light, still I think the love of God is the\r\n    best light of the soul of man.”\r\n\r\nThis is a long extract; but it is of some consequence, as furnishing\r\na key to the whole of Wesley’s literary pursuits—from this, the\r\ncommencement of his Methodist career, to the end of his protracted\r\nlife. His aim was not to shine in scholarship, but to live a life of\r\ngoodness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1742.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1742 Age 39]\r\n\r\nWesley now began to enlarge the sphere of his operations. Hitherto,\r\nhis only stated congregations had been at Kingswood, at Bristol, and\r\nat the Foundery, London. For these, the ministrations of himself and\r\nhis brother were sufficient; but, as the work increased, new preachers\r\nbecame needful. Cennick and Humphreys had both left him; but others\r\nsupplied their places. John Nelson came to London, was converted, and,\r\nat the end of the year 1740, returned to Birstal in Yorkshire, where,\r\nimpelled by the love of Christ, and almost without knowing it, he\r\nbegan to preach to his unconverted neighbours. Thomas Maxfield also,\r\none of the first converts in Bristol, and who, for a year or two,\r\nseems to have travelled with Charles Wesley, perhaps in the capacity\r\nof servant, being left in London, to meet during Wesley’s absence the\r\nFoundery society, pray with them, and give them suitable advice, was\r\ninsensibly led from praying to preaching,—his sermons being accompanied\r\nwith such power, that numbers were made penitent and were converted.\r\nWesley, hearing of this irregularity, hurried back to London, for the\r\npurpose of stopping it. His mother, living in his house, adjoining the\r\nFoundery, said: “John, take care what you do with respect to that young\r\nman, for he is as surely called of God to preach, as you are. Examine\r\nwhat have been the fruits of his preaching, and hear him yourself.” The\r\nCountess of Huntingdon also wrote: “Maxfield is one of the greatest\r\ninstances of God’s peculiar favour that I know. He is my astonishment.\r\nThe first time I made him expound, I expected little from him; but,\r\nbefore he had gone over one fifth part of his discourse, my attention\r\nwas riveted, and I was immovable. His power in prayer, also, is very\r\nextraordinary.”[430]\r\n\r\nWesley was convinced, and the Rubicon was passed. “I am not clear,”\r\nhe writes under the date of April 21, 1741, “that brother Maxfield\r\nshould not expound at Greyhound Lane; nor can I as yet do without him.\r\nOur clergymen” (Stonehouse, Hall, and others) “have miscarried full as\r\nmuch as the laymen; and that the Moravians are other than laymen, I\r\nknow not.”[431] Wesley wrote again, about four years after employing\r\nMaxfield:—\r\n\r\n    “I am bold to affirm, that these unlettered men have help\r\n    from God for the great work of saving souls from death. But,\r\n    indeed, in the one thing which they profess to know, they are\r\n    not ignorant men. I trust there is not one of them, who is\r\n    not able to go through such an examination, in substantial,\r\n    practical, experimental divinity, as few of our candidates for\r\n    holy orders, even in the university, are able to do. In answer\r\n    to the objection, that they are laymen, I reply, the scribes\r\n    of old, who were the ordinary preachers among the Jews, were\r\n    not priests; they were not better than laymen. Yea, many of\r\n    them were incapable of the priesthood, being not of the tribe\r\n    of Levi. Hence, probably, it was, that the Jews themselves\r\n    never urged it as an objection to our Lord’s preaching, that\r\n    He was no priest after the order of Aaron; nor, indeed, could\r\n    be; seeing He was of the tribe of Judah. Nor does it appear\r\n    that any objected this to the apostles. If we come to later\r\n    times, was Mr. Calvin ordained? Was he either priest or deacon?\r\n    And were not most of those whom it pleased God to employ in\r\n    promoting the Reformation abroad, laymen also? Could that great\r\n    work have been promoted at all, in many places, if laymen had\r\n    not preached? In all Protestant churches, ordination is not\r\n    held a necessary pre-requisite of preaching; for in Sweden, in\r\n    Germany, in Holland, and, I believe, in every Reformed church\r\n    in Europe, it is not only permitted, but required, that, before\r\n    any one is ordained, he shall publicly preach a year or more\r\n    _ad probandum facultatem_. And, for this practice, they believe\r\n    they have an express command of God; ‘let those first be\r\n    proved, then let them use the office of a deacon, being found\r\n    blameless’ (1 Tim. iii. 10). Besides, in how many churches, in\r\n    England, does the parish clerk read one of the lessons, and\r\n    in some the whole service of the Church, perhaps every Lord’s\r\n    day? And do not other laymen constantly do the same thing in\r\n    our very cathedrals? which, being under the inspection of\r\n    the bishops, should be patterns to all other churches. Nay,\r\n    is it not done in the universities themselves? Who ordained\r\n    that singing man at Christ Church; who is likewise utterly\r\n    unqualified for the work, murdering every lesson he reads; not\r\n    endeavouring to read it as the word of God, but rather as an\r\n    old song?”\r\n\r\nWhere is the priest, pretending that preaching belongs exclusively to\r\nthose in orders, who can answer such arguments as these? But Wesley’s\r\ncase was stronger than even this. He proceeds to relate that, after God\r\nhad used him and his brother clergymen, in several places, in turning\r\nmany from a course of sin to a course of holiness, the ministers of\r\nthese places, instead of receiving them with open arms, spoke of them\r\n“as if the devil, not God, had sent them; and represented them as\r\nfellows not fit to live,—papists, heretics, traitors, conspirators\r\nagainst their king and country;” while the people, who had been\r\nconverted by their preaching, were “driven from the Lord’s table,\r\nand were openly cursed in the name of God.” What could be done in a\r\ncase like this? “No clergyman would assist at all. The expedient that\r\nremained was, to find some one among themselves, who was upright of\r\nheart, and of sound judgment in the things of God; and to desire him\r\nto meet the rest as often as he could, in order to confirm, as he was\r\nable, in the ways of God, either by reading to them, or by prayer, or\r\nby exhortation.”\r\n\r\nThis was done, and God blessed it. “In several places, by means of\r\nthese unlettered men, not only those who had already begun to run well\r\nwere hindered from drawing back to perdition; but other sinners also,\r\nfrom time to time, were converted from the error of their ways.”\r\n\r\n“This plain account,” continues Wesley, “of the whole proceeding, I\r\ntake to be the best defence of it. I know no scripture which forbids\r\nmaking use of such help, in a case of such necessity. And I praise\r\nGod who has given even this help to those poor sheep, when ‘their own\r\nshepherds pitied them not.’”\r\n\r\nBrave-hearted Wesley! The step he took was momentous; but he was a\r\nmatch for all opposers; and marvellous is the fact that the very\r\nChurch, which so branded him for such a departure from Church order,\r\nis now actually copying his example. Notable, in future years, will be\r\nthe incident, which has almost passed without being noticed, that, in\r\nthe month of May, 1869, in his own private chapel, at London House,\r\nDr. Jackson, Bishop of London, formally authorised eight laymen “to\r\nread prayers, and to read and _explain_ the Holy Scriptures,” and “to\r\nconduct religious services for the poor in schools, and mission rooms,\r\nand in the open air,” in the London diocese, with the understanding\r\nand agreement that their labours will be rendered gratuitously.[432]\r\nThus are even bishops treading in the once hated footsteps of the great\r\nMethodist.\r\n\r\nIn 1742, Wesley’s itinerating commenced in earnest. During the year,\r\nhe spent about twenty-four weeks in London and its vicinity; fourteen\r\nin Bristol and the surrounding neighbourhood; one in Wales; and\r\nthirteen in making two tours to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, taking, on his\r\nway, Donnington Park, Birstal, Halifax, Dewsbury, Mirfield, Epworth,\r\nSheffield, and other towns and villages adjoining these.\r\n\r\nWhitefield spent the first two months in Bristol, Gloucester, and the\r\nwest of England, and the three following in London. He then went to\r\nScotland, where he continued until the end of October, when he returned\r\nto London for the remainder of the year.\r\n\r\nWesley and he were again friends. On April 23, Wesley writes: “I spent\r\nan agreeable hour with Mr. Whitefield. I believe he is sincere in all\r\nhe says, concerning his earnest desire of joining hand in hand with all\r\nthat love the Lord Jesus Christ. But if, as some would persuade me, he\r\nis not, the loss is all on his own side. I am just as I was. I go on my\r\nway, whether he goes with me or stays behind.”\r\n\r\nThis interview took place at Easter, a season of the year which\r\nMoorfields was wont to keep with uproarious hilarity. On this occasion,\r\nthe spacious rendezvous was filled, from end to end, with mountebanks,\r\nplayers, drummers, trumpeters, merryandrews, and menageries. Whitefield\r\nmounted his field pulpit, and from twenty to thirty thousand people\r\nflocked around him. He became a target, at which were hurled dirt,\r\ndead cats, stones, and rotten eggs. A fool belonging to one of the\r\npuppetshows attempted to lash him with a whip; and a recruiting\r\nsergeant, with his drum and other musical instruments, marched through\r\nhis congregation; but Whitefield, for three hours, continued praying,\r\npreaching, and singing; and then retired to the Tabernacle, with his\r\npocket full of notes from persons who had been awakened by his sermon,\r\nand which were read amid the praises and acclamations of assembled\r\ncrowds. A thousand such papers had been sent to him; and three hundred\r\nand fifty of the inquiring penitents were received into church\r\nfellowship in a single day.[433]\r\n\r\nWesley and Whitefield henceforth were divided, and yet united. Each\r\npursued his own separate course; but their hearts were one. Their\r\ncreeds were different; but not their aims. “Mr. Wesley,” writes\r\nWhitefield in 1742, “I think is wrong in some things; but I believe he\r\nwill shine bright in glory. I have not given way to him, or to any,\r\nwhom I thought in error, no not for an hour; but I think it best not to\r\ndispute, where there is no probability of convincing.”[434] And again,\r\nin a letter to Wesley himself, on October 11, 1742, he says: “I had\r\nyour kind letter, dated October 5. In answer to the first part of it, I\r\nsay, ‘Let old things pass away, and all things become new.’ I can also\r\nheartily say ‘Amen’ to the latter part of it—‘Let the king live for\r\never and controversy die,’ It has died with me long ago. I thank you,\r\ndear sir, for praying for me. I have been upon my knees praying for you\r\nand yours, and that nothing but love, lowliness, and simplicity may be\r\namong us!”[435]\r\n\r\nTo the day of his death, Whitefield breathed this loving spirit, and\r\nrejoiced to find reciprocal affection in his friend Wesley. After\r\nthis, we shall refrain from adverting to his history more than we find\r\nneedful,—not for want of admiration of his character and labours, but\r\nbecause it is impossible, in casual notices, to do him justice. He\r\nwas still hounded as much as ever by the dogs of persecution. Though\r\nhe was now in Scotland, where, if anywhere, his Calvinistic doctrines\r\nwere likely to gain him favour, yet even there he met with virulent\r\nopposers. Among other extremely bitter pamphlets published against him,\r\nin 1742, was one printed at Edinburgh, “by a true lover of the Church\r\nand country,” who represented him as taking upon himself “the office\r\nof a thirteenth apostle,” and concluded his courteous outpouring thus:\r\n“Let all good people beware of this stroller, for he will yet find a\r\nway to wheedle you out of your money. He is as artful a mountebank\r\nas any I know.” Another pamphlet, entitled “The Declaration of the\r\nTrue Presbyterians, within the Kingdom of Scotland, concerning Mr.\r\nGeorge Whitefield and the work at Cambuslang,” begun as follows:—“The\r\ndeclaration, protestation, and testimony of the suffering remnant of\r\nthe anti-popish, anti-Lutheran, anti-prelatic, anti-Whitefieldian,\r\nanti-Erastian, anti-sectarian, true Presbyterian church of Christ\r\nin Scotland;” and then this windy performance, of thirty-two pages,\r\nproceeds to say that Whitefield is “an abjured, prelatic hireling, of\r\nas lax toleration principles as any that ever set up for the advancing\r\nthe kingdom of Satan. He is a wandering star, who steers his course\r\naccording to the compass of gain and advantage.” A third publication,\r\nissued in 1742, was, “A Warning against countenancing the ministrations\r\nof Mr. George Whitefield, wherein is shown that Mr. Whitefield is no\r\nminister of Jesus Christ; that his call and coming to Scotland are\r\nscandalous; that his practice is disorderly and fertile of disorder;\r\nand that his whole doctrine is, and his success must be, diabolical.\r\nBy Adam Gib, minister of the gospel at Edinburgh.” In this sweet\r\neffusion of seventy-five pages, poor Whitefield is solemnly pronounced\r\nto be “one of those false Christs, of whom the church is forewarned,\r\nMatt. xxiv. 24.” After reviewing some of Whitefield’s tenets, Mr.\r\nAdam Gib deliciously remarks: “in raking through this dunghill of Mr.\r\nWhitefield’s doctrine, we have raised as much _stink_ as will suffocate\r\nall his followers, that shall venture to draw near without stopping\r\ntheir noses.” “The complex scheme of his doctrine is diabolical; it\r\nproceeds through diabolical influence, and is applied unto a diabolical\r\nuse, against the Mediator’s glory and the salvation of men.” This was\r\npretty strong for a young man, twenty-nine years of age, and who, four\r\nyears afterwards, became the leader of the party known by the name of\r\nAnti-burghers. We are prepared, by such pious venom, for the fact,\r\nthat, in the year following, when the “associate presbytery met for\r\nrenewing the national covenant of Scotland, and the solemn league and\r\ncovenant of the three nations,” they drew up and printed “a confession\r\nof the sins of the ministry,” in which they humble themselves before\r\nGod, for not “timeously” warning the people against Whitefield; for\r\nbeing “too remiss in their endeavours to prevent the sad effects\r\nof his ministrations;” for being “too little affected by the\r\nlatitudinarian principles and awful delusions which he had propagated;”\r\nand for not “crying to God, that He would rebuke the devourer, and cast\r\nthe false prophet and the unclean spirit out of the land.”[436]\r\n\r\nDespite all this, Whitefield cheerily pursued the path marked out by\r\nProvidence. Few men have been more entitled to the last beatitude in\r\nour Saviour’s sermon, “Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and\r\npersecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely,\r\nfor My sake.”\r\n\r\nIt was through the timely interposition of Howel Harris, that the\r\nfriendship between Wesley and Whitefield was resumed. Towards this\r\nwarm-hearted Welshman Wesley cherished the most sincere affection, and,\r\non the 6th of August, 1742, wrote to him as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR BROTHER,—I have just read yours, dated at Trevecca,\r\n    October 19, 1741. And what is it that we contend about? Allow\r\n    such a perfection as you have there described, and all further\r\n    dispute I account vain jangling and mere strife of words. As to\r\n    the other point, we agree: (1) that no man can have any power\r\n    except it be given him from above; (2) that no man can merit\r\n    anything but hell, seeing all other merit is in the blood of\r\n    the Lamb. For those two fundamental points, both you and I\r\n    earnestly contend; what need, then, of this great gulf to be\r\n    fixed between us? Brother, is thy heart with mine, as my heart\r\n    is with thine? If it be, give me thy hand. I am indeed a poor,\r\n    foolish, sinful worm; and how long my Lord will use me, I know\r\n    not. I sometimes think the time is coming when He will lay me\r\n    aside. For surely never before did He send such a labourer into\r\n    such a harvest. But, so long as I am continued in the work, let\r\n    us rise up together against the evil-doers; let us not weaken,\r\n    but strengthen one another’s hands in God. My brother, my soul\r\n    is gone forth to meet thee; let us fall upon one another’s\r\n    neck. The good Lord blot out all that is past, and let there\r\n    henceforward be peace between me and thee!\r\n\r\n    “I am, my dear brother, ever yours,\r\n    “JOHN WESLEY.”[437]\r\n\r\nAnother of Wesley’s friends, at this period, was the Rev. Henry Piers,\r\nvicar of Bexley, a devoted man, who, through the instrumentality of\r\nCharles Wesley and Mr. Bray, had found peace with God on the 10th of\r\nJune, 1738. He at once began to preach, with great fidelity, the\r\nscriptural method of salvation; and such was his success, that in\r\nAugust, 1739, Whitefield assisted him in administering the sacrament,\r\nin Bexley church, to nearly six hundred communicants. Keziah Wesley\r\nwas an inmate of his house; and Wesley himself was a welcome visitor.\r\nHe was one of the six persons who composed Wesley’s first Conference,\r\nin 1744; and one of the three who publicly walked with Wesley from the\r\nchurch of St. Mary’s, Oxford, when he preached, for the last time,\r\nbefore the university.\r\n\r\nIn 1742, the vicar of Bexley was appointed to preach at Sevenoaks,\r\n“before the right worshipful the Dean of the Arches, and the reverend\r\nthe clergy of the deanery of Shoreham, assembled in visitation.” The\r\ntext chosen by Mr. Piers was 1 Corinthians iv. 1, 2; and his object\r\nwas to show what doctrines ministers ought to preach, and also what\r\nought to be their tempers and behaviour. A letter to Wesley, written\r\nMay 24, three days after the sermon was delivered, states that, at\r\nthe beginning of his discourse, Piers was listened to with gravity;\r\nbut, while dwelling upon the doctrines of the Church, his reverend\r\nauditors began to indulge in “shrewd looks and indignant smiles”; this\r\nwas followed with “laughter and loud whispers,” some of them saying,\r\n“Piers is mad, crazy, and a fool.” When he came to the application of\r\nhis discourse, and asked whether the clergy preached such doctrines,\r\npossessed such tempers, and led such lives, the ordinary would endure\r\nit no longer, but beckoned to the apparitor to open his pew door, and\r\nto the minister of Sevenoaks church to command Piers to stop. The\r\nminister made a sign to the preacher, but without effect. The ordinary\r\nthen publicly desired Piers to pronounce the benediction, as the\r\ncongregation had already heard quite enough. Piers, however, still went\r\non; all the clergy, except one or two, walked out; and the preacher,\r\nwithout further interruption, finished his discourse to an attentive\r\naudience.[438]\r\n\r\nThe sermon, though written by Mr. Piers, was, previous to its being\r\npreached, revised by Wesley;[439] and, in September ensuing, was\r\npublished, price sixpence,[440] with a list of the books sold by Wesley\r\nat the Foundery in Moorfields, inserted. The sermon, in point of fact,\r\nwas a joint production of Wesley and his friend. Any one, comparing\r\nit with other sermons published by Mr. Piers, will perceive an\r\nunmistakable difference in style, and force of expression. The sermon\r\nwas, to a great extent, Wesley’s; and, in this instance, Wesley was\r\nalmost preaching by proxy.\r\n\r\nWesley longed for helpers; but, conscious that none would be useful\r\nunless converted, he was careful in accepting offers. Of his friend\r\nPiers he could have no doubt; but it was otherwise with respect to a\r\nclergyman from America, who called upon him at the beginning of the\r\nyear, and “appeared full of good desires.” Wesley writes: “I cannot\r\nsuddenly answer in this matter; I must first know what spirit he is\r\nof; for none can labour with us, unless he ‘count all things dung\r\nand dross, that he may win Christ.’” With Wesley, neither learning,\r\nnor talent, nor even orders, nor all combined, were sufficient to\r\ninduce him to accept a helper, unless there was also piety. Purity in\r\npreachers is of more importance than either scholarship, or genius, or\r\nboth united. The former is an essential, without which no man ought to\r\npreach; the latter are, at the best, but useful in helping a preacher\r\nto preach successfully.\r\n\r\nIn a certain sense, Methodist societies were begun in 1739; but it was\r\nnot until 1742 that they were divided into classes. In January, 1739,\r\nthe London society, which was really Moravian, and not Methodist,\r\nconsisted of about sixty persons. Three months after that, Wesley\r\nwent to Bristol, where “a few persons agreed to meet weekly, with the\r\nsame intention as those in London”; and these were soon increased\r\nby “several little societies, which were already meeting in divers\r\nparts of the city,” amalgamating with them. About the same time\r\nsimilar societies were formed at Kingswood and at Bath.[441] These\r\nreligious communities grew and multiplied. At the beginning of 1742,\r\nthe London society alone, after repeated siftings, numbered about\r\neleven hundred members.[442] Hitherto, Wesley and his brother had\r\nbeen their only pastors; but, on February 15, 1742, an accident led to\r\na momentous alteration. Nearly three years before, Wesley had built\r\nhis meeting-house in Bristol; but, notwithstanding the subscriptions\r\nand collections made at the time to defray the expense, a large debt\r\nwas still unpaid. On the day mentioned, some of the principal members\r\nof the Bristol society met together to consult how their pecuniary\r\nobligations should be discharged. One of them stood up and said, “Let\r\nevery member of the society give a penny a week, till the debt is\r\npaid.” Another answered, “Many of them are poor, and cannot afford to\r\ndo it.” “Then,” said the former, “put eleven of the poorest with me;\r\nand if they can give anything, well; I will call on them weekly; and if\r\nthey can give nothing, I will give for them as well as for myself. And\r\neach of you call on eleven of your neighbours weekly; receive what they\r\ngive, and make up what is wanting.” “It was done,” writes Wesley; “and\r\nin a while, some of these informed me, they found such and such an one\r\ndid not live as he ought. It struck me immediately, ‘This is the thing,\r\nthe very thing, we have wanted so long.’”\r\n\r\nWhat was the result? Wesley called together these weekly collectors\r\nof money to pay the debt on the Bristol chapel, and desired each,\r\nin addition to collecting money, to make particular inquiry into\r\nthe behaviour of the members whom they visited. They did so. Many\r\ndisorderly walkers were detected; and thus the society was purged of\r\nunworthy members.[443]\r\n\r\nWithin six weeks after this, on March 25, Wesley introduced the\r\nsame plan in London; where he had long found it difficult to become\r\nacquainted with all the members personally. He requested “several\r\nearnest and sensible men to meet him,” to whom he explained his\r\ndifficulty. They all agreed that, “to come to a sure, thorough\r\nknowledge of each member, there could be no better way than to divide\r\nthe society into classes, like those at Bristol.” Wesley, at once,\r\nappointed, as leaders, “those in whom he could most confide”; and\r\nthus, after an existence of three years, the Methodist societies were\r\ndivided into classes, in 1742. “This,” says Wesley, “was the origin\r\nof our classes, for which I can never sufficiently praise God; the\r\nunspeakable usefulness of the institution having ever since been more\r\nand more manifest.”[444]\r\n\r\nAt first, the leaders visited each member at his own house; but this\r\nwas soon found to be inconvenient. It required more time than the\r\nleaders had to spare; and many members lived with masters, mistresses,\r\nor relations, where it was almost impossible for such visits to be\r\nmade. Hence, before long, it was agreed, that each leader should meet\r\nhis apportioned members all together, once a week, at a time and place\r\nmost convenient for the whole. The leader began and ended each meeting\r\nwith singing and prayer, and spent about an hour in conversing with\r\nthose present, one by one.[445]\r\n\r\nThus class-meetings began. Wesley writes, “It can scarce be conceived\r\nwhat advantages have been reaped by this little prudential regulation.\r\nMany now experienced that Christian fellowship, of which they had not\r\nso much as an idea before. They began to bear one another’s burdens,\r\nand naturally to care for each other’s welfare. And as they had daily\r\na more intimate acquaintance, so they had a more endeared affection\r\nfor each other. Upon reflection, I could not but observe, this is the\r\nvery thing which was from the beginning of Christianity. As soon as any\r\nJews or heathen were so convinced of the truth, as to forsake sin, and\r\nseek the gospel of salvation, the first preachers immediately joined\r\nthem together; took an account of their names; advised them to watch\r\nover each other; and met these κατηχουμενοι, _catechumens_, as they\r\nwere then called, apart from the great congregation, that they might\r\ninstruct, rebuke, exhort, and pray with them, and for them, according\r\nto their several necessities.”[446]\r\n\r\nSuch is Wesley’s own account of the origin of these weekly meetings.\r\nSome of the old members were, at first, extremely averse to this new\r\narrangement, regarding it, not as a privilege, but rather a restraint.\r\nThey objected, that there were no such meetings when they joined the\r\nsociety, and asked why such meetings should be instituted now. To this\r\nWesley answered, that he regarded class-meetings not essential, nor of\r\nDivine institution, but merely prudential helps, which it was a pity\r\nthe society had not been favoured with from the beginning. “We are\r\nalways open to instruction,” says he to these complainants, “willing to\r\nbe wiser every day than we were before, and to change whatever we can\r\nchange for the better.”\r\n\r\nAnother objection was, “There is no scripture for classes.” Wesley\r\nreplied, that there was no scripture against them; and that, in point\r\nof fact, there was much scripture for them, namely, texts which\r\nenjoined the substance of the thing, leaving indifferent circumstances\r\nto be determined by reason and experience.\r\n\r\nThe most plausible objection of all, however, was that which is often\r\nurged at the present day. Wesley writes: “They spoke far more plausibly\r\nwho said, ‘The thing is well enough in itself; but the leaders have\r\nneither gifts nor graces for such an employment.’ I answer—(1) Yet such\r\nleaders as they are, it is plain God has blessed their labour. (2) If\r\nany of these is remarkably wanting in gifts or grace, he is soon taken\r\nnotice of and removed. (3) If you know any such, tell it to me, not\r\nto others, and I will endeavour to exchange him for a better. (4) It\r\nmay be hoped they will all be better than they are, both by experience\r\nand observation, and by the advices given them by the minister every\r\nTuesday night, and the prayers (then in particular) offered up for\r\nthem.”[447]\r\n\r\nThe appointment of these leaders was of vast importance; but it was\r\nnot sufficient. Wesley continues: “As the society increased, I found\r\nit required still greater care to separate the precious from the vile.\r\nIn order to this, I determined, at least once in every three months,\r\nto talk with every member myself, and to inquire at their own mouths,\r\nwhether they grew in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist. At these seasons, I likewise particularly inquire whether\r\nthere be any misunderstanding or difference among them; that every\r\nhindrance of peace and brotherly love may be taken out of the way.”[448]\r\n\r\nNothing need be added to this full account of the origin of the\r\nclass-meeting and the quarterly visitation of the Methodists. Wesley,\r\nfrom the beginning, “recognised the scriptural distinction between\r\nthe church and the world. The men who possessed religion, and the men\r\nwho possessed it not, were not for a moment confounded. They might be\r\nneighbours in locality, and friends in goodwill; but they were wide as\r\nthe poles asunder in sentiment. The quick and the dead may be placed\r\nside by side; but no one can, for ever so short a period, mistake dead\r\nflesh for living fibre. The church and the churchyard are close by;\r\nbut the worshippers in the one and the dwellers in the other are as\r\nunlike as two worlds can make them. The circle within the circle, the\r\ncompany of the converted, Wesley always distinguished from the mass of\r\nmankind, and made special provision for their edification in all his\r\norganisms.”[449]\r\n\r\nAfter the formation of classes, the next event in point of importance,\r\nin the year 1742, was Wesley’s visit to the north of England. A\r\ncombination of circumstances led to this.\r\n\r\nJohn Nelson had been converted among the Methodists in London, and had\r\nreturned to Birstal, in Yorkshire, where Benjamin Ingham had already\r\nfounded a number of flourishing Moravian brotherhoods. Nelson began to\r\npreach in the towns of Yorkshire; his labours were greatly blessed;\r\nand many of the greatest profligates, blasphemers, drunkards, and\r\nsabbath-breakers were entirely changed. John had often invited Wesley\r\nto visit Yorkshire, and this was one of the reasons of his setting\r\nout.[450]\r\n\r\nAnother was, that the Countess of Huntingdon had earnestly urged him\r\nto proceed to Newcastle, and to employ his best efforts to improve\r\nthe moral and religious condition of the colliers on the Tyne. The\r\nletter, containing this request, has not been published, but is in the\r\npossession of the Rev. James Everett.\r\n\r\nThe countess was now resident at Donnington Park, the favourite home of\r\nher noble husband, the Earl of Huntingdon, who, like herself, treated\r\nministers of Christ with every mark of polite attention. His sisters,\r\nLady Betty Hastings, and Lady Margaret, (who afterwards became the\r\nwife of Ingham,) had been converted through the instrumentality of the\r\nMethodists, and were now sincere and earnest Christians. Donnington\r\nbecame a sort of rallying place for Christian ministers and Christian\r\npeople. Mr. Simpson and Mr. Graves, two converted clergymen, resided\r\nin the neighbourhood. David Taylor, one of the servants of the Earl\r\nof Huntingdon, had commenced preaching in the surrounding hamlets\r\nand villages, and had begun a work which resulted in the forming of\r\nthe New Connexion of General Baptists. Miss Fanny Cooper, residing\r\nwith the countess, and dying of consumption, was greatly beloved by\r\nWesley, and wished to see him.[451] All these circumstances had to do\r\nwith his setting out for the midland counties, for Yorkshire, and for\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of January, Lady Huntingdon wrote to him, saying, that Miss\r\nCooper was waiting for the consolation of Israel with an indescribable\r\nfirmness of faith and hope. She had read his Journal, which he had sent\r\nfor her perusal, and thought there was nothing in it which ought to be\r\nleft out; and that the manner in which he spoke of himself could not be\r\nmended.[452]\r\n\r\nIn another letter, dated the 15th of March, she tells him that she is\r\nsure he is a chosen vessel set for the defence of the gospel; that she\r\nhas given up the school at Markfield; that John Taylor is gone to be\r\nan assistant to David Taylor, and to become a schoolmaster among the\r\npeople who had been converted; and that Mr. Graves had been blessed by\r\nWesley’s conversation, and greatly loved him.[453]\r\n\r\nIn a third letter, dated ten days later, Wesley is informed that John\r\nTaylor is about to wait upon him, and to say that, unless David Taylor\r\n(who had contracted an ill judged marriage, and fallen into the German\r\nstillness) transferred his flock to Wesley and his brother Charles, the\r\ncountess would withdraw from him her support and countenance. She adds:\r\n“I would not trust David with the guidance of my soul, no, not for\r\nworlds. I find he is going to build himself a room, and to break with\r\nthe ministers, and become a lay preacher. He has more pride than I ever\r\nsaw in man. If he will commit his poor sheep into your hands, I will\r\nassist in the room, school, etc.; but else will I do nothing. You are\r\nmuch mistaken about the bishops not reading what you publish; I know\r\nthey do. Let me know in your next if you approve what I have done about\r\nDavid.”[454]\r\n\r\nSix weeks afterwards, Lady Huntingdon wrote again, saying that Miss\r\nCooper was at the point of death, and wished to see Wesley; and that\r\na horse had been ordered for John Taylor to go down with him.[455]\r\nOn receiving this, Wesley started almost immediately. He reached\r\nDonnington Park on May 22; found Miss Cooper just alive; spent three\r\ndays with her and the countess, rejoicing in the grace of God; and then\r\nset out for Birstal, still accompanied by John Taylor.[456] On arriving\r\nat Birstal, Wesley went to an inn and sent for John Nelson; and John\r\ncame and carried him to his own humble home. Thus was the aristocratic\r\nmansion exchanged for the mason’s cottage. Numbers had been converted\r\nby John’s plain, blunt preaching; but, because he advised them to go to\r\nchurch and sacrament, Ingham reproved him, and forbade the members of\r\nhis societies to hear him.\r\n\r\nIngham, to some extent at least, had fallen into the dangerous\r\ndelusions of the Moravians. He had also exposed himself to suspicions\r\nof another kind. Dr. Doddridge, in a letter written a fortnight\r\nbefore Wesley’s visit to Birstal, says: “I am much surprised with a\r\nbook, called the ‘Country Parson’s Advice to a Parishioner,’ which is\r\ncirculated, with extreme diligence, by Ingham, and other Methodists in\r\nour part of the country. It artfully disguises, but most evidently\r\ncontains and recommends, almost all the doctrines of popery, and none\r\nmore than that fatal one of consigning conscience and fortune into the\r\nhands of the priesthood.[457] I am not hasty to smell out a Jesuit,\r\nand ever thought the Methodists had more honesty than wisdom; but this\r\ncertain fact surprises me, and I should be glad of a key to it. It may\r\nbe said, that they have generally appeared men of plain understandings,\r\nvoid of that art and learning necessary for missionaries; but all\r\nplots require tools, and have underparts, nor may these always be let\r\ninto the whole design. On the whole, while they are diffusing such\r\nsentiments, Protestantism and our free constitution may have as little\r\nreason to thank them as learning and reason have already.”[458]\r\n\r\nWesley preached, on May 26, at noon, on the top of Birstal hill; spent\r\nthe afternoon in conversing with Nelson’s converts; and, at eight\r\nat night, preached on Dewsbury moor, two miles from Birstal, and,\r\nin opposition to the Moravian tenets, “earnestly exhorted all who\r\nbelieved, to wait upon God in His ways, and to let their light shine\r\nbefore men.”\r\n\r\nHis labours were not without success. One of his hearers was Nathaniel\r\nHarrison, a young man twenty-three years of age, who soon after was\r\nmade circuit steward, an office which he filled for more than twenty\r\nyears, and during a long life encountered no small amount of brutal\r\npersecution for the sake of his great Master. His father turned him\r\nout of doors; his eldest brother horsewhipped him; and the mob hurled\r\nmissiles at his head, and, on one occasion, were literally bespattered\r\nwith his blood. Nathaniel Harrison was a happy Christian, and attained\r\nto the age of eighty years before he died; he was wont to say, “My soul\r\nis always on the wing, I only wait the summons.”[459]\r\n\r\nAnother of Wesley’s hearers was John Murgatroyd, a weaver, who\r\nbecame a member of the second class which was formed in Yorkshire;\r\nwas present when John Nelson was pressed for a soldier; and was one\r\nof those brave-hearted Methodists who sang songs of praise at the\r\ndoor of Nelson’s prison. He lived to have ten children, fifty-one\r\ngrandchildren, and twenty-one great grandchildren; and, after being\r\nsixty-three years a Methodist, he peacefully breathed his last breath\r\nat Wansford, in the east of Yorkshire, having, on the day before,\r\nattended three public services, and sung the praises of his Saviour\r\nwith an animation which seemed to evince that he was exulting in the\r\nhope of singing the new song in heaven.[460]\r\n\r\nLeaving Birstal, Wesley and John Taylor came to Newcastle on Friday,\r\nMay 28.\r\n\r\nThis northern metropolis was then widely different to what it is at\r\npresent. Then the only streets, of any consequence, were Pilgrim\r\nStreet, Newgate Street, Westgate Street, the Side, and Sandgate. On\r\nthe south of Westgate Street there was nothing but open country.\r\nBetween Westgate Street and Newgate Street, the only buildings were the\r\nvicarage and St. John’s church; whilst between Newgate Street and the\r\nupper part of Pilgrim Street almost the only edifice was the house of\r\nthe Franciscan Friars. On the east of Pilgrim Street were open fields,\r\nand on the north nothing but a few straggling houses. The town was\r\nsurrounded with a wall, having turrets, towers, and gates. On what is\r\nnow the centre of the town, stood the princely dwelling of Sir William\r\nBlackett, environed with extensive pleasure grounds, adorned with trees\r\nand statues. There were five churches: St. John’s, in which, besides\r\nthe Sunday services, there were public prayers three times every week;\r\nSt. Andrew’s, where, in addition to services on sabbaths, prayers were\r\nread every Wednesday and Friday morning; Allhallows; St. Nicholas’s,\r\nin which there was public service twice daily; and the church of\r\nSt. Thomas, at the entrance of the street on Newcastle bridge. The\r\nRoman Catholics had a chapel at the Nuns; the Quakers a meeting-house\r\nin Pilgrim Street, nearly opposite to the Pilgrim’s Inn; and the\r\nDissenters two or three chapels in different parts, and also a burial\r\nground near Ballast Hills.[461]\r\n\r\nAs already stated, Wesley reached Newcastle on Friday night, the 28th\r\nof May. The public house, in which he lodged, belonged to a Mr. Gun,\r\nand stood a few yards northward of the site on which he built his\r\nOrphan House. This, at the time, was open country, and about a mile\r\nfrom busy, dirty, degraded Sandgate on the river side. On walking out,\r\nafter tea, he was surprised and shocked at the abounding wickedness.\r\nDrunkenness and swearing seemed general, and even the mouths of little\r\nchildren were full of curses. How he spent the Saturday we are not\r\ninformed; but, on Sunday morning, at seven,[462] he and John Taylor\r\ntook their stand, near the pump, in Sandgate, “the poorest and most\r\ncontemptible part of the town,” and began to sing the old hundredth\r\npsalm and tune. Three or four people came about them, “to see what\r\nwas the matter;” these soon increased in number, and, before Wesley\r\nfinished preaching, his congregation consisted of from twelve to\r\nfifteen hundred persons. When the service was ended, the people still\r\n“stood gaping, with the most profound astonishment,” upon which Wesley\r\nsaid: “If you desire to know who I am, my name is John Wesley. At five\r\nin the evening, with God’s help, I design to preach here again.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the commencement of Methodism in the north of England,—the\r\npreacher the renowned John Wesley, doubtless dressed in full\r\ncanonicals, with plain John Taylor standing at his side,—the time seven\r\no’clock on a Sunday morning, in the beautiful month of May,—the place\r\nSandgate, crowded with keelmen and sailors, using, says Christopher\r\nHopper, “the language of hell, as though they had received a liberal\r\neducation in the regions of woe,”[463]—the song of praise the old\r\nhundredth psalm, which, like the grand old ocean, is as fresh and as\r\nfull of music now as it was when it first was written,—and the text,\r\nthe very pith of gospel truth, “He was wounded for our transgressions,\r\nHe was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was\r\nupon Him, and with His stripes we are healed.”\r\n\r\nStrict churchman as he was, there can be but little doubt, that Wesley\r\nand his companion attended the morning and afternoon services in some\r\nof the Newcastle churches; but at five o’clock, amid balmy breezes,\r\nhe again took his stand on the hill, by the side of the Keelman’s\r\nHospital. On one hand was the town with the fine old wall, fortified\r\nwith towers; on the other hand were fields, stretching away to Ouseburn\r\nand Byker; behind him was the open country, dotted here and there with\r\nfragrant gardens, Jesus’s Hospital, the workhouse, the charity school\r\nof Allhallows church, and Pandon Hall, formerly the residence of the\r\nNorthumbrian kings; while just before him were the swarming hordes of\r\nSandgate, the crowded quay, and the river Tyne. The hill was covered\r\nfrom its summit to its base. In Moorfields and on Kennington Common,\r\nhe had preached to congregations numbering from ten to twenty thousand\r\npeople; but his congregation here was the largest he had ever seen.\r\n“After preaching,” he writes, “the poor people were ready to tread me\r\nunder foot, out of pure love and kindness.” With difficulty, he reached\r\nhis inn, where he found several of his hearers waiting his arrival.\r\nThey told him they were members of a religious society, which had\r\nexisted for many years, had a “fine library,” and whose “steward read\r\na sermon every Sunday.” They urged him to remain with them, at least,\r\na few days longer; but, having promised to be at Birstal on Tuesday\r\nnight, he was unable to consent. Accordingly, rising even before the\r\nsun on Monday morning, he set out at three o’clock, rode about eighty\r\nmiles, and lodged at night at Boroughbridge. The next day, he came to\r\nBirstal, holding a prayer-meeting at Knaresborough on the way; and at\r\nnight, surrounded by a vast multitude, conducted a religious service\r\nof two hours and a half duration. In Birstal and its neighbourhood, he\r\nspent the next three days, preaching at Mrs. Holmes’s, near Halifax, at\r\nDewsbury Moor, at Mirfield, and at Adwalton.\r\n\r\nHe then set out for Epworth, and went to an inn, where an old servant\r\nof his father’s and two or three poor women found him. The next day\r\nbeing Sunday, he offered to assist Mr. Romley, the curate, either by\r\npreaching or reading prayers; but his offer was declined, and a sermon\r\nwas offensively preached by Romley against enthusiasts. After the\r\nservice, John Taylor gave notice, as the people were coming out, that\r\nMr. Wesley, not being permitted to preach in the church, designed\r\nto preach in the churchyard, at six o’clock. Accordingly, at that\r\nhour, he stood on his father’s tombstone, and preached to the largest\r\ncongregation Epworth had ever witnessed. The scene was unique and\r\ninspiriting,—a living son preaching on a dead father’s grave, because\r\nthe parish priest refused to allow him to officiate in a dead father’s\r\nchurch. “I am well assured,” writes Wesley, “that I did far more good\r\nto my Lincolnshire parishioners by preaching three days on my father’s\r\ntomb, than I did by preaching three years in his pulpit.”[464]\r\n\r\nContrary to his intention, he remained eight days at Epworth, and every\r\nnight used his father’s tombstone as his rostrum. He also preached at\r\nBurnham, Ouston, Belton, Overthorp, and Haxey. Here religious societies\r\nhad been formed; but two men, John Harrison and Richard Ridley, had\r\npoisoned them with the Moravian heresy, telling them that “all the\r\nordinances are man’s inventions, and that if they went to church or\r\nsacrament, they would be damned.” One of them, at Belton, who once ran\r\nwell, now said “he saw the devil in every corner of the church, and in\r\nthe face of every one who went to it.” Still, a great work had been\r\nwrought among them, and some of them had suffered for it. “Their angry\r\nneighbours,” says Wesley, “had carried a whole wagon-load of these new\r\nheretics before a magistrate. But when he asked what they had done,\r\nthere was a deep silence, for that was a point their conductors had\r\nforgotten. At length, one said ‘they pretended to be better than other\r\npeople, and prayed from morning to night;’ and another said, ‘they have\r\n_convarted_ my wife. Till she went among them she had such a tongue!\r\nand now she is as quiet as a lamb!’ ‘Take them back, take them back,’\r\nreplied the justice, ‘and let them convert all the scolds in the town.’”\r\n\r\nAs already intimated, Wesley’s preaching on his father’s grave was\r\nattended with amazing power. On one occasion, the people on every side\r\nwept aloud; and on another, several dropped down as dead; Wesley’s\r\nvoice was drowned by the cries of penitents; and many there and then,\r\nin the old churchyard, found peace with God, and broke out into loud\r\nthanksgiving. A gentleman, who had not been at public worship of any\r\nkind for upwards of thirty years, stood motionless as a statue. “Sir,”\r\nasked Wesley, “are you a sinner?” “Sinner enough!” said he, and still\r\nstood staring upwards, till his wife and servant, who were both in\r\ntears, put him into his chaise, and took him home.\r\n\r\nJohn Whitelamb, Wesley’s brother-in-law, clergyman at Wroote, heard\r\nhim preach at Epworth, and wrote him, saying, “Your presence creates\r\nan awe, as if you were an inhabitant of another world. I cannot think\r\nas you do; but I retain the highest veneration and affection for you.\r\nThe sight of you moves me strangely. My heart overflows with gratitude.\r\nI cannot refrain from tears, when I reflect, this is the man, who at\r\nOxford was more than a father to me; this is he, whom I have there\r\nheard expound, or dispute publicly, or preach at St. Mary’s, with such\r\napplause. I am quite forgotten. None of the family ever honour me with\r\na line! Have I been ungrateful? I have been passionate, fickle, a fool;\r\nbut I hope I shall never be ungrateful.”[465]\r\n\r\nOn receiving this, Wesley hastened to visit his old friend; preached,\r\non his way, at Haxey; then again in Whitelamb’s church; and again, at\r\nnight, on his father’s tomb, to an immense multitude, the last service\r\nlasting for about three hours. He writes, “We scarce knew how to part.\r\nOh, let none think his labour of love is lost because the fruit does\r\nnot immediately appear! Near forty years did my father labour here; but\r\nhe saw little fruit of all his labour. I took some pains among this\r\npeople too; and my strength also seemed spent in vain: but now the\r\nfruit appeared. There were scarce any in the town on whom either my\r\nfather or I had taken any pains formerly, but the seed, sown so long\r\nsince, now sprung up, bringing forth repentance and remission of sins.”\r\n\r\nThus, despite Mr. Romley’s railing at the enthusiast, his churchyard\r\nbecame the scene of some of Wesley’s greatest triumphs. John Whitelamb,\r\nwriting to Charles Wesley, says: “I had the honour and happiness of\r\nseeing and conversing with my brother John. He behaved to me truly like\r\nhimself. I found in him, what I have always experienced heretofore, the\r\ngentleman, the friend, the brother, and the Christian.”[466]\r\n\r\nWesley’s visit to Epworth was a memorable one; and it is not surprising\r\nthat artists have vied with each other in portraying it. Thousands of\r\nMethodist homes have pictures of Wesley preaching on his father’s tomb;\r\nand the scene itself, throughout all time, will be regarded as one of\r\nthe most striking incidents in Wesley’s history. Here, at Epworth,\r\nWesley’s venerable father had toiled, with exemplary diligence and\r\nfidelity, for the long space of nine-and-thirty years; a man who, for\r\nstrength of mind and godly earnestness, had few superiors; and yet, a\r\nman whose life was a perpetual worry of poverty and persecution. Here,\r\nWesley’s almost unequalled mother, during the whole of that period,\r\nhad been the sharer of her husband’s joys and sorrows. Here had been\r\nnurtured a family, who, for genius, talent, and romantic history, must\r\nalways stand high among the remarkable households of mankind. The\r\nfamily was now scattered. Seven years had elapsed since the father’s\r\ndeath. Samuel, the eldest, and Keziah, the youngest of the children,\r\n(that survived the days of infancy,) had since expired. And what about\r\nthe widowed mother? We shall soon see.\r\n\r\nWesley left Epworth on the 14th of June; and, after preaching for four\r\ndays in Sheffield and the neighbourhood, he hastened to the Countess of\r\nHuntingdon’s, and thence, by way of Coventry, Evesham, and Stroud, to\r\nthe city of Bristol, which he reached on June 28.\r\n\r\nWithin a month after this, his venerable mother exchanged earth for\r\nheaven. Hearing of her illness, he hastened from Bristol to London\r\nto see her. Charles was absent, but her five daughters were with\r\nher. Wesley writes: “I found my mother on the borders of eternity;\r\nbut she had no doubt or fear; nor any desire but to depart and to be\r\nwith Christ.” She died of gout,[467] on Friday, July 23. Early in the\r\nmorning, on awaking out of sleep, she cried, “My dear Saviour! Art\r\nThou come to help me at my last extremity?” In the afternoon, as soon\r\nas the intercession meeting at the Foundery was ended, Wesley went to\r\nher, and found her pulse almost gone, and her fingers dead. Her look\r\nwas calm, and her eyes were fixed upward. Wesley used the commendatory\r\nprayer, and, with his sisters, sang a requiem to her parting soul. She\r\nwas perfectly sensible, but gasping for life. Within an hour, she died\r\nwithout a struggle, groan, or sigh; and Wesley and his sisters stood\r\nround her bed, and fulfilled her last request, uttered a little before\r\nshe lost her speech: “Children, as soon as I am released, sing a psalm\r\nof praise to God.” The remains of this sainted lady were interred on\r\nSunday, August 1, in Bunhill-fields. An immense multitude was present;\r\nWesley performed the service; and then preached from Revelation xx. 12,\r\n13. “It was,” says he, “one of the most solemn assemblies I ever saw,\r\nor expect to see on this side eternity.”[468]\r\n\r\nWesley spent the next three months in London and in Bristol, and in\r\njourneying to and fro; his brother Charles labouring, at the same time,\r\nat Newcastle and in the north.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of August, he met his brother and Charles Caspar Graves in\r\nBristol. Mr. Graves had been a student of St. Mary Magdalen College,\r\nOxford, and was one of the Oxford Methodists. Two years after the\r\nWesleys left for Georgia, the friends of Graves believed him to be\r\n“stark mad,” and removed him from his college. He found peace with God\r\nin 1738, and became an exceedingly zealous out-door preacher; but,\r\nin 1740, he was persuaded, and almost coerced, to sign a paper to\r\nthe effect, that he now renounced the principles and practice of the\r\nMethodists; that he was heartily sorry he had occasioned scandal by\r\nattending their meetings; and that, in future, he should avoid doing so.\r\n\r\nFor nearly two years, he acted accordingly; but, on meeting the Wesleys\r\nin Bristol at the time above mentioned, he wrote to the fellows of St.\r\nMary Magdalen College, revoking the document he had been led to sign,\r\nand declaring that he now looked upon himself “to be under no kind of\r\nobligation to observe anything contained in that scandalous paper, so\r\nunchristianly imposed upon him.”\r\n\r\nImmediately after this, Charles Wesley and Mr. Graves set off for the\r\nnorth of England. Having spent a few days with John Nelson and his\r\nMethodist friends at Birstal, they proceeded to Newcastle. Mr. Graves\r\nreturned to Birstal in about a fortnight; but Charles Wesley continued\r\namong the colliers of the Tyne, formed the Newcastle society, and did\r\nnot return to London until his brother was ready to take his place in\r\nthe month of November following.[469]\r\n\r\nOn his arrival, November 13, Wesley met, what he calls, “the wild,\r\nstaring, loving society;” he took them with him to the sacrament at\r\nAllhallows church; he reproved some among them who walked disorderly;\r\nand ascertained that few were thoroughly convinced of sin, and scarcely\r\nany could witness that their sins were pardoned. Great power, however,\r\nbegan to attend his preaching. On one occasion, six or seven dropped\r\ndown as dead; and, at another time, several of the genteel people were\r\nconstrained to roar aloud for the disquietness of their hearts.\r\n\r\nHe extended his labours to the surrounding villages. At Whickham he\r\n“spoke strong, rough words;” but none of the people seemed to regard\r\nhis sayings. At Tanfield Leigh, he preached “to a dead, senseless,\r\nunaffected congregation.” At Horsley, notwithstanding a bitter frost,\r\nhe preached in the open air, the wind driving upon the congregation,\r\nand scattering straw and thatch among them in all directions.\r\n\r\nIn Newcastle, though the season was winter, he preached out of doors\r\nas often as he could; and, at other times, in a room, in a narrow\r\nlane, now Lisle Street, nearly opposite the site of Wesley’s Orphan\r\nHouse. This “room,” or “tabernacle” (as it was also called) had been\r\nbuilt “by a fanatic of the name of Macdonald,” who had now removed to\r\nManchester.[470] It was the first Methodist meeting-house in the north\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nThe work accomplished was marvellous. It was only eight months since\r\nWesley entered Newcastle as a perfect stranger; and, yet, there were\r\nnow above eight hundred persons joined together in his society,\r\nbesides many others in the surrounding towns and villages who had been\r\nbenefited by his ministry. He writes: “I never saw a work of God, in\r\nany other place, so evenly and gradually carried on. It continually\r\nrose step by step. Not so much seemed to be done at any one time, as\r\nhad frequently been done at Bristol or London; but something at every\r\ntime.”[471]\r\n\r\nAmong these northern converts, there were not a few, who subsequently\r\nrendered important service to the cause of Christ; brave spirits who\r\ndeserve a niche in Methodistic history, but whom, for the present, we\r\nare reluctantly obliged to pass in silence.\r\n\r\nSuch a society being formed, a place for meeting became imperative.\r\nSeveral sites were offered; one outside the gate of Pilgrim Street\r\nwas bought; and, on December 20, the foundation stone was laid; after\r\nwhich Wesley preached, but, three or four times during the sermon,\r\nwas obliged to stop, that the people might engage in prayer and give\r\nthanks to God. The building was calculated to cost £700; Wesley had\r\njust twenty-six shillings towards this expenditure;[472] many thought\r\nit would never be completed; but Wesley writes: “I was of another mind;\r\nnothing doubting but, as it was begun for God’s sake, He would provide\r\nwhat was needful for the finishing it.”\r\n\r\nThis “clumsy, ponderous pile,” as John Hampson calls it, was then the\r\nlargest Methodist meeting-house in England. “Clumsy and ponderous”\r\nwe grant it was, but still a “pile” hallowed by associations far too\r\nsacred to be easily forgotten. Here one of the first Sunday-schools\r\nin the kingdom was established, and had not fewer than a thousand\r\nchildren in attendance. Here a Bible society existed before the British\r\nand Foreign Bible Society was formed. Here was one of the best choirs\r\nin England; and here, among the singers, were the sons of Mr. Scott,\r\nafterwards the celebrated Lords Eldon and Stowell.[473] Here was the\r\nresting place of John Wesley’s first itinerants; and here colliers and\r\nkeelmen, from all parts of the surrounding country, would assemble,\r\nand, after the evening service, would throw themselves upon the\r\nbenches, and sleep the few remaining hours till Wesley preached at five\r\nnext morning.[474] The “clumsy, ponderous” old Orphan House was the\r\nhead quarters of Methodism in the north of England.\r\n\r\nWithin the last four years Wesley had built “the room” at Bristol, and\r\nthe school at Kingswood; and he had bought, and repaired, and almost\r\nrebuilt “that vast, uncouth heap of ruins,” called “the Foundery.” He\r\nbegan in Bristol without funds, but money had been furnished as he\r\nneeded it; and now, with £1 6_s._, he begun to erect a building to cost\r\n£700. Three months after laying the foundation stone, in the inclement\r\nmonth of March, while the building was yet without roof, doors, or\r\nwindows, Wesley opened it by preaching from the narrative of the rich\r\nman and Lazarus; and, afterwards, amid bricks, mortar, and a builder’s\r\nusual _débris_, held a watchnight, the light of a full moon probably\r\nbeing the only illumination the damp, cold, unfinished building had,\r\nand equinoctial gales and winter winds wafting the watchnight hymns of\r\nthese happy Methodists to a higher and holier world than this. Truly\r\nthe cradle in which Methodism was rocked by the hand of Providence was\r\noften rough.\r\n\r\nHaving begun the building, it was high time for Wesley to begin to find\r\nmeans to pay for it. Accordingly, he arranged to leave his Newcastle\r\nfriends on the last day of 1742. He preached his farewell sermon—a\r\nsermon of two hours’ continuance—in the open air; men, women, and\r\nchildren hung upon him, and were unwilling to part with him; and, even\r\nafter he had mounted his horse and started on his journey, “a muckle\r\nwoman” kept her hold of him, and ran by his horse’s side, through thick\r\nand thin, till the town was fairly left behind him.\r\n\r\nWe thus find Methodism firmly rooted in Bristol, Kingswood, London, and\r\nNewcastle; and, besides this, Wesley writes: “In this year many other\r\nsocieties were formed in Somersetshire, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire,\r\nLeicestershire, Warwickshire, and Nottinghamshire, as well as the\r\nsouthern parts of Yorkshire.”[475]\r\n\r\nNot only were churches on earth multiplied, but additions were made\r\nto the church in heaven. Mr. Dolman, who rarely failed to be at the\r\nFoundery by five o’clock, died full of love, and peace, and joy in\r\nbelieving. James Angel gave up his spirit to God in the full triumph of\r\nfaith. Mary Whittle cried out: “It is done, it is done! Christ lives\r\nin me;” and died in a moment. Another female member of the London\r\nsociety expired with the words, “I fear not death; it hath no sting\r\nfor me. I shall live for evermore.” Sarah Whiskin cried out, “My Lord\r\nand my God!” fetched a double sigh, and died. John Woolley, a child of\r\nthirteen years, threw his arms wide open, and said, “Come, come, Lord\r\nJesus! I am Thine;” and soon after breathed his last. And Lucy Godshall\r\ndied basking in the light of her Saviour’s countenance. All these\r\nbelonged to the London society.\r\n\r\nThe purest gold is sometimes mixed with dross; and so it was with\r\nMethodism. Some of the Foundery society fanatically talked of feeling\r\nthe blood of Christ running upon their arms, their breasts, their\r\nhearts, and down their throats. Wesley met them, and denounced their\r\nfolly as the empty dreams of heated imaginations. Good John Brown, of\r\nTanfield Leigh, two or three days after his conversion, came riding\r\nthrough Newcastle, hallooing and shouting, and driving all the people\r\nbefore him; telling them that God had revealed to him that he should\r\nbe a king, and should tread all his enemies beneath his feet. Wesley\r\narrested him, and sent him home immediately, advising him to cry day\r\nand night to God, lest the devil should gain an advantage over him.\r\nThese were rare exceptions, and were promptly checked.\r\n\r\nTwo, who called themselves _prophets_, came to Wesley in London,\r\nstating, that they were sent from God to say, he would shortly be\r\n_born’d_ again; and that, unless he turned them out, they would stay\r\nin the house till it was done. He gravely answered, that he would not\r\nturn them out, and took them down into the room of the society. Here he\r\nleft them. “It was tolerably cold,” says he, “and they had neither meat\r\nnor drink. However, there they sat from morning to evening, when they\r\nquietly went away, and I have heard nothing from them since.”\r\n\r\nIn 1742, persecution by means of the public press had, to some extent,\r\nabated;[476] but mobs and vulgar-minded men were as violent as ever. At\r\nLong Lane, in London, they threw large stones upon the house in which\r\nWesley was preaching, which, with the tiles, fell among the people,\r\nendangering their lives. At Chelsea, burning substances were cast into\r\nthe room till it was filled with smoke. At Pensford, near Bristol, a\r\nhired rabble brought a bull, which they had been baiting, and tried to\r\ndrive it among the people; and then, forcing their way to the little\r\ntable on which Wesley stood, they “tore it bit from bit,” with fiendish\r\nvengeance. A similar outrage was perpetrated in the neighbourhood of\r\nWhitechapel. The mob did their utmost to force a herd of cattle among\r\nthe congregation; and then threw showers of stones, one of which struck\r\nWesley between the eyes; but, wiping away the blood, he continued the\r\nservice as if nought had happened. At Cardiff, while Charles Wesley was\r\npreaching, women were kicked, and their clothes set on fire by rockets,\r\nthrown into the room among them; the desk in which the preacher stood\r\nwas dashed to pieces, and the Bible wrested from his hands, one of the\r\nbrutal persecutors solemnly declaring that, if he went straight to hell\r\nfor doing it, he would persecute the Methodists to his dying day.[477]\r\n\r\nIn the midst of such violence, Wesley calmly pursued the path of duty,\r\npraying, preaching, visiting the sick and dying, forming societies,\r\nbuilding chapels, reading, writing, and publishing.\r\n\r\nDuring the year, he read Dr. Pitcairn’s works,—“dry, sour, and\r\ncontroversial;” Jacob Behmen’s Exposition of Genesis, the “most sublime\r\nnonsense, inimitable bombast, fustian not to be paralleled, all of a\r\npiece with his inspired interpretation of the word _tetragrammaton_;\r\nMadame Guyon’s “Short Method of Prayer,” and “Les Torrents\r\nSpirituelles,” from which “poor quietist” the Moravians had taken many\r\nof their unscriptural expressions; “The Life of Ignatius Loyola,” “a\r\nsurprising book,” concerning “one of the greatest men that ever engaged\r\nin supporting so bad a cause;” and “The Life of Gregory Lopez,” “a good\r\nand wise, though much mistaken man.”\r\n\r\nWesley’s publications, during 1742, were the following:—\r\n\r\n1. “A Companion for the Altar. Extracted from Thomas à Kempis.” 12mo,\r\n24 pages.\r\n\r\n2. “An Extract of the Rev. Mr. John Wesley’s Journal, from August 12,\r\n1738, to November 1, 1739.” 12mo, 98 pages.\r\n\r\n3. “A Treatise on Christian Prudence. Extracted from Mr. Norris.”[478]\r\n12mo, 35 pages.\r\n\r\n4. “A Collection of Hymns, translated from the German;” 36 pages. These\r\nwere twenty-four in number, and had previously been published in his\r\n“Hymns and Sacred Poems.”\r\n\r\n5. “A Narrative of the Work of God, at and near Northampton in New\r\nEngland. Extracted from Mr. Edwards’s Letter to Dr. Coleman.” 12mo, 48\r\npages.\r\n\r\n6. “A Collection of Tunes set to Music, as they are commonly sung at\r\nthe Foundery.” Duodecimo, of thirty-six pages, containing forty-three\r\ntunes for one voice only, some set in the treble and some in the tenor\r\nclef.[479]\r\n\r\nGreat revivals of religion have generally been attended by copious\r\nproductions of hymns of praise; and thus it was at the rise of\r\nMethodism. This was emphatically the great era of hymn writing in the\r\nEnglish church. Watts, Doddridge, and Erskine poured forth the joys\r\nof their converted hearts, and furnished lyric lines, which have been\r\nused, in sacred worship, by millions. But of all the hymnists then\r\nliving, the Wesleys were the most remarkable. A competent authority\r\nhas estimated that, during Wesley’s lifetime there were published not\r\nfewer than six thousand six hundred hymns from the pen of Charles\r\nWesley only.[480] Having furnished their societies with so many hymns,\r\nno wonder that the Wesleys collected and furnished tunes. Their\r\nreligion made them happy; and happiness always finds vent in song.\r\nThe old Methodists were remarkable for their singing. Why? Because\r\ntheir hearts throbbed with the “joy unspeakable and full of glory.”\r\nMake a man happy, and he is sure to sing. Thus it was with Wesley and\r\nthe thousands who looked to him as their great leader. Naturally, the\r\nWesleys were full of poetry; and religion, so far from extinguishing\r\nthe fire, fanned it into a holy flame. Their taste in music may be\r\ngathered from Wesley’s directions to his preachers. “Suit the tune\r\nto the words. Avoid complex tunes, which it is scarcely possible to\r\nsing with devotion. Repeating the same words so often, especially\r\nwhile another repeats different words, shocks all common sense,\r\nnecessarily brings in dead formality, and has no more religion in it\r\nthan a Lancashire hornpipe. Sing no anthems. Do not suffer the people\r\nto sing too slow. In every society, let them learn to sing; and let\r\nthem always learn our own tunes first. Let the women constantly sing\r\ntheir parts alone. Let no man sing with them, unless he understands\r\nthe notes, and sings the bass, as it is pricked down in the book.\r\nIntroduce no new tunes till they are perfect in the old. Let no organ\r\nbe placed anywhere, till proposed in the Conference. Recommend our\r\ntune-book everywhere; and if you cannot sing yourself, choose a person\r\nor two in each place to pitch the tune for you. Exhort every one in the\r\ncongregation to sing, not one in ten only.”[481]\r\n\r\nWell would it be if Methodist ministers were to enforce such rules as\r\nthese, instead of leaving the most beautiful part of public worship,\r\nas is too often done, to the irreligious whims and criminal caprice\r\nof organists and choirs. No one can doubt the fact that, within the\r\nlast forty years, the singing in Methodist chapels has deteriorated\r\nto an extent which ought to be alarming. The tunes now too generally\r\nsung are intolerably insipid; and, as to any sympathy between them\r\nand the inspiriting hymns of Charles Wesley, it would be preposterous\r\nto say that a particle of such sympathy exists. Such singing may suit\r\nthe _classic_ taste of fashionable congregations assembled amid the\r\nchilling influence of gothic decorations; but it bears no resemblance\r\nwhatever to the general outbursts of heartfelt praise, adoration, and\r\nthanksgiving, which characterised the old Methodists. It is high time\r\nfor Methodist preachers to keep John Wesley’s rules respecting singing;\r\nto substitute John Wesley’s tunes and others like them for the soulless\r\nsounds now called classic music; and to feel that, before God and man,\r\nthey are as much responsible for the singing in sanctuaries as they are\r\nfor that part of public worship which consists of prayer.\r\n\r\n7. Wesley’s last publication, in 1742, was “The Principles of a\r\nMethodist,” 12mo, 32 pages. This was written in reply to a pamphlet of\r\nthe Rev. Josiah Tucker, who had tried to show that the Methodists, in\r\nthe first instance, had been the disciples of William Law the mystic,\r\nand then of the Moravians; and, that now their principles were a\r\nperfect “medley of Calvinism, Arminianism, Quakerism, Quietism, and\r\nMontanism, all thrown together.”[482]\r\n\r\nIn reply to the charge of believing inconsistencies, Wesley remarks:—1.\r\nThat Mr. Law’s system of truth had never been the creed of the\r\nMethodists. He himself was eight years at Oxford before he read any\r\nof Mr. Law’s writings; and when he did read them, so far from making\r\nthem his creed, he had objections to almost every page. 2. That the\r\nGermans, with whom he travelled to Georgia, infused into him no ideas\r\nabout justification, or anything else; for he came back with the same\r\nnotions he had when he went; but Peter Bohler’s affirmation that\r\ntrue faith in Christ is always attended with “dominion over sin, and\r\nconstant peace from a sense of forgiveness,” and that “justification\r\nwas an instantaneous work,”—led him to make anxious inquiry, which\r\nresulted in his conviction, that Bohler’s doctrine was true, and that,\r\nnotwithstanding all his past good performances, he himself was still\r\nwithout true faith in Christ. 3. He repudiates the inconsistent creed\r\nwhich Mr. Tucker puts into his mouth, and concludes as follows:—“I may\r\nsay many things which have been said before, and perhaps by Calvin\r\nor Arminius, by Montanus or Barclay, or the Archbishop of Cambray;\r\nbut it cannot thence be inferred that I hold a ‘medley of all their\r\nprinciples,—Calvinism, Arminianism, Montanism, Quakerism, Quietism,\r\nall thrown together,’ There might as well have been added Judaism,\r\nMahommedanism, Paganism. It would have made the period rounder, and\r\nbeen full as easily proved, I mean asserted; for no other proof is yet\r\nproduced.”\r\n\r\nThis was Wesley’s first battle. In his “address to the reader,” he\r\nremarks:—\r\n\r\n    “I have often wrote on controverted points before; but not with\r\n    an eye to any particular person. So that this is the first time\r\n    I have appeared in controversy, properly so called. Indeed I\r\n    have not wanted occasion to do it before; particularly when,\r\n    after many stabs in the dark, I was publicly attacked, not by\r\n    an open enemy, but by my own familiar friend.” [Whitefield.]\r\n    “But I could not answer him. I could only cover my face and\r\n    say, Και συ εις εκεινων; και συ, τεκνον; ‘Art thou\r\n    also among them? art thou, my son?’\r\n\r\n    “I now tread an untried path, ‘with fear and trembling’; fear,\r\n    not of my adversary, but of myself. I fear my own spirit, lest\r\n    I ‘fall where many mightier have been slain.’ Every disputant\r\n    seems to think (as every soldier) that he may hit his opponent\r\n    as much as he can; nay, that he ought to do his worst to him,\r\n    or he cannot make the best of his own cause.”\r\n\r\nWesley then denounces this mode of conducting controversy, and declares\r\nthat he wishes to treat Mr. Tucker and all opponents as he would treat\r\nhis own brother. In such a spirit, Wesley began his long continued,\r\nperhaps unparalleled, controversial life.[483]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1743.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1743 Age 40]\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1743, Wesley spent about fourteen weeks in London,\r\nten in Bristol and its vicinity, thirteen in Newcastle and the\r\nneighbourhood, three in Cornwall, and twelve in travelling chiefly to\r\nthe north of England. He was now a thorough itinerant; and itinerating\r\nin England then was widely different from what it is at present.\r\nTurnpike roads did not exist; and no stage coach went farther north\r\nthan the town of York.[484] Wesley travelled on horseback, reading as\r\nhe rode, and usually having one of his preachers with him. In a life\r\nlike this, there was much of both hardship and incident. For instance,\r\non New Year’s day, between Doncaster and Epworth, he met a man so\r\ndrunk that he could hardly keep his seat, but who, on discovering that\r\nWesley was his fellow traveller, cried out, “I am a Christian! I am a\r\nChurchman! I am none of your Culamites!” And then, as if afraid that\r\nWesley might turn out to be the devil, away he went, as fast as his\r\nhorse could carry him. Twelve days after, on reaching Stratford upon\r\nAvon, Wesley was requested to visit a woman of middle age, who, with\r\na distorted face, and a lolling tongue, had bellowed so horribly, in\r\nthe presence of the parish minister, that he pronounced her possessed\r\nwith demons. Wesley went, but, staring at her visitor, she said nothing\r\nailed her. After singing a verse or two, Wesley and his friends began\r\nto pray. Just as he commenced, he felt as if he “had been plunged into\r\ncold water,” and immediately there was a tremendous roar. The woman\r\nwas reared up in bed, her whole body moving, without bending either\r\njoint or limb. Then it writhed into all kinds of postures, the poor\r\nwretch still bellowing. Wesley, however, continued praying, until all\r\ndemoniacal symptoms ceased, and the woman began rejoicing and praising\r\nGod. On another occasion, in the month of April, while baiting his\r\nhorse at Sandhutton, he found sitting, in the chimney corner of the\r\npublic house, a good natured man, who was enjoying his grog with the\r\ngreatest gusto. Wesley began to talk to him about sacred things, having\r\nno suspicion that he was talking to the parish priest. And yet so it\r\nwas; but the reverend tippler, instead of boiling over with offence,\r\nbegged his reprover to call upon him when he next visited his village.\r\nIn July, when he and John Downes reached Darlington, from Newcastle,\r\nboth their horses lay down and died; and, in August, when he was\r\nleaving London for Bristol, his saddle slipped upon his horse’s neck;\r\nhe was jerked over the horse’s head; and the horse itself ran back to\r\nSmithfield. Six days later, being in Exeter, he went to church both\r\nmorning and afternoon, and writes: “the sermon in the morning was quite\r\ninnocent of meaning; what that in the afternoon was, I know not; for\r\nI could not hear a single sentence.” In October, when he was leaving\r\nEpworth, he had to cross the Trent in a ferry boat; a terrible storm\r\nwas raging; and the cargo consisted of three horses and eight men and\r\nwomen. In the midst of the river, the side of the boat was under water,\r\nand the horses and men rolling one over another, while Wesley was laid\r\nin the bottom, pinned down with a large iron bar, and utterly unable to\r\nhelp himself. Presently, however, the horses jumped into the water, and\r\nthe boat was lightened, and came safe to land. Such were some of the\r\nincidents Wesley met with in 1743.\r\n\r\nOne of the first events in this memorable year was the organisation\r\nof the Calvinistic Methodists in Wales. At a meeting held at Watford\r\n(near Cardiff), on January 5 and 6, and at which there were present\r\nfour clergymen—Whitefield, Rowlands, Powell, and Williams, and three\r\nlaymen—Howel Harris, Joseph Humphreys, and John Cennick, it was agreed\r\nthat “public exhorters” should be employed, and that each “public\r\nexhorter,” with the assistance of “private exhorters,” should take the\r\noversight of twelve or fourteen societies. Each “private exhorter” was\r\nto inspect only one or two societies, and was to follow his ordinary\r\ncalling. Howel Harris was to be a general travelling superintendent;\r\nand the clergymen were to itinerate as much as they were able. Each\r\nsociety was to have a box, under the care of stewards, to receive\r\nweekly contributions towards the support of the general work; and the\r\nclergymen and exhorters were to meet in conference once, or oftener,\r\nevery year.[485] Thus Whitefield, Harris, Humphreys, and Cennick began\r\nto _organise_ their societies before the Wesleys did.\r\n\r\nAfter an absence of seven weeks, Wesley returned to Newcastle, on\r\nthe 19th of February, and at once set to work to purge the society\r\nof unworthy members. Since he left, on December 30, seventy-six had\r\nforsaken the society; and sixty-four were now expelled, about eight\r\nhundred still remaining. Of those who had voluntarily withdrawn\r\nthemselves, a large proportion were Dissenters, who left, because\r\notherwise their ministers refused to them the sacrament; thirty-three\r\nbecause their husbands, wives, parents, masters, or acquaintance\r\nobjected; five because such bad things were said of the society; nine\r\nbecause they would not be laughed at; one because she was afraid of\r\nfalling into fits; and fourteen for sundry other reasons. Among those\r\nexpelled, there were two for swearing; two for sabbath breaking;\r\nseventeen for drunkenness; two for retailing spirituous liquors; three\r\nfor quarreling; one for beating his wife; three for wilful lying;\r\nfour for railing; one for laziness; and twenty-nine for lightness\r\nand carelessness. Thus, within a few months after its formation, the\r\nNewcastle society was purged of one hundred and forty of its members.\r\n\r\nJoined with Newcastle were a number of country places, at each of which\r\nWesley preached every week, excepting Swalwell, where he went only\r\nonce a fortnight. These were Horsley, Pelton, Chowden, South Biddick,\r\nTanfield, Birtley, and Placey. At Chowden, he found he had got into\r\nthe very Kingswood of the north; twenty or thirty wild children, in\r\nrags and almost nakedness, flocking round about him. At Pelton, in the\r\nmidst of the sermon, one of the colliers began to shout amain from an\r\nexcess of joy; but their usual token of approbation was clapping Wesley\r\non the back. At Placey, the colliers had always been in the first rank\r\nfor savage ignorance and all kinds of wickedness. Every Sunday men,\r\nwomen, and children met together to dance, fight, curse and swear,\r\nand play at chuck ball, span farthing, or whatever came to hand; but,\r\nnotwithstanding this, when Wesley went among them, on the 1st of April,\r\nand preached amid wind, sleet, and snow till he was encased in ice,\r\n“they gave earnest heed to the things which were spoken.”\r\n\r\nIn Newcastle, almost every night, there were scenes of great\r\nexcitement. Numbers dropped down, lost their strength, and were seized\r\nwith agonies. Some said, they felt as if a sword was running through\r\nthem; others thought a great weight upon them; others could hardly\r\nbreathe; and others felt as if their bodies were being torn to pieces.\r\n“These symptoms,” says Wesley, “I can no more impute to any natural\r\ncauses, than to the Spirit of God. I can make no doubt, but it was\r\nSatan tearing them, as they were coming to Christ. And hence proceeded\r\nthose grievous cries, whereby he might design both to discredit the\r\nwork of God, and to affright fearful people from hearing that word\r\nwhereby their souls might be saved.”\r\n\r\nWesley left on April 7, and on the 30th of May was succeeded by his\r\nbrother. Charles put an end to these annoying fits, and says, “I am\r\nmore and more convinced it was a device of Satan to stop the course of\r\nthe gospel.” He preached to “a thousand wild people” at Sunderland. At\r\nSouth Shields, his congregation consisted of “a huge multitude; many of\r\nthem very fierce and threatening”; while the churchwardens and others\r\ntried to interrupt him by throwing dirt, and even money among the\r\npeople. The mob at North Shields, led on by the parish priest, roughly\r\nsaluted him; his reverence commanding a man to blow a horn, and his\r\ncompanions to shout.\r\n\r\nCharles left on the 21st of June, and, eight days afterwards,\r\nwas succeeded by John. The society was further reduced, by fresh\r\nbackslidings, to about six hundred members. Wesley spent nearly three\r\nweeks among them; formed a society out of “his favourite congregation\r\nat Placey;” and then returned to London.\r\n\r\nHe came again on October 31st, and found the following advertisement\r\nwas published:—\r\n\r\n                     “FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR. ESTE.\r\n\r\n     By the Edinburgh Company of Comedians, on Friday, November 4,\r\n\r\n                    will be acted a Comedy, called\r\n\r\n                         THE CONSCIOUS LOVERS;\r\n\r\n               To which will be added, a Farce, called,\r\n\r\n              TRICK UPON TRICK, OR METHODISM DISPLAYED.”\r\n\r\nThe day came; and about fifteen hundred people assembled in Moot Hall\r\nto see the funny farce, some hundreds having to sit upon the stage.\r\nSoon after the comedians began the first act of “The Conscious Lovers,”\r\nthe seats upon the stage broke down, and their occupants were left\r\nsprawling in all directions. In the midst of the second act, all the\r\nshilling seats gave a crack, and began to sink. The people shrieked,\r\nand numbers ran away. When the third act was commencing, the entire\r\nstage suddenly sunk about six inches, and the players precipitately\r\nfled. At the end of the act, all the sixpenny seats, in a moment,\r\nfell with an alarming crash, which caused cries on every side. Most\r\nof the people had now left the hall, but, two or three hundred still\r\nremaining, Este, who was to act the Methodist, came forward and told\r\nthem he was determined that the farce should be performed. While he was\r\nspeaking, the stage sunk six inches more; when the valorous comedian\r\nand the remnant of his audience took to their heels in the utmost\r\nconfusion. The week after, however, the farce was acted, and hundreds\r\nof people went again to see it.\r\n\r\nOne or two incidents in connection with Wesley’s northern journeys may\r\nbe noticed here.\r\n\r\nWhile returning to the south, at the beginning of the year, he was, for\r\nthe first time in his life, repelled from the sacramental table. This\r\noccurred at Epworth. Having preached, on his father’s tomb, to a large\r\ncongregation, gathered from the neighbouring towns, and it being the\r\nsacramental Sunday, some of the people went to Romley, the curate, to\r\nask his permission to communicate; to whom the proud priest replied,\r\n“Tell Mr. Wesley, I shall not give _him_ the sacrament; for he is not\r\n_fit_.” Wesley writes, “How wise a God is our God! there could not have\r\nbeen so fit a place under heaven, where this should befal me first,\r\nas my father’s house, the place of my nativity, and the very place\r\nwhere, ‘according to the straitest sect of our religion,’ I had so\r\nlong ‘lived a Pharisee.’ It was also fit, in the highest degree, that\r\nhe who repelled me from that very table where I had myself so often\r\ndistributed the bread of life, should be one who owed his all in this\r\nworld to the tender love which my father had shown to his, as well as\r\npersonally to himself.”\r\n\r\nWhile on his third journey to Newcastle, in 1743, Wesley paid his first\r\nvisit to the town of Grimsby. Here a woman—a magdalen, who was parted\r\nfrom her husband—offered him a convenient place for preaching, and,\r\nunder his sermon, became a penitent. Wesley, after hearing her domestic\r\nhistory, told her she must return instantly to her forsaken spouse. She\r\nreplied, her husband was at Newcastle, and she knew not how to reach\r\nhim. Wesley said, “I am going to Newcastle to-morrow morning. William\r\nBlow is going with me; and you shall ride behind him.” This was an odd\r\narrangement, and perhaps not too prudent; but it was carried out. The\r\npoor creature rode to Newcastle, sad and sombre; there she met her\r\nhusband; and, a short time after, was drowned at sea, while on her way\r\nto Hull.\r\n\r\nThe year 1743 will always be memorable for the riots in Staffordshire.\r\nAt this period, West Bromwich was an open common, covered with heath,\r\nand burrowed with rabbit warrens. Wednesbury was a small country town,\r\nirregularly built, the roads following ancient footways, and leaving\r\nwide spaces unoccupied. One of these was called the “High Bullen,”\r\nand was the place where bulls were baited. So extensively did this\r\nbarbarous sport prevail in the “black country,” that, in Tipton parish,\r\nnineteen of these furious animals were baited at one of the annual\r\nwakes. Wednesbury, however, was most celebrated for its cockfights.\r\nIndeed, the Wednesbury “cockings,” as Charles Knight informs us, were\r\nalmost as famous as the races of the “Derby day” at the present time.\r\nRecreations are an index to character, and sports, such as these,\r\nreflected, as well as moulded, the moral condition of the people.\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley, accompanied by Mr. Graves, was the first Methodist who\r\npreached at Wednesbury. This was in November, 1742.[486] His brother\r\nfollowed in January, 1743, and spent four days among the people,\r\npreached eight sermons, and formed a society of about one hundred\r\nmembers.[487] Mr. Egginton, the vicar, was extremely courteous, told\r\nWesley he had done much good already, and he doubted not would do\r\nmuch more, invited him to his house, and said the oftener he came the\r\nbetter.[488]\r\n\r\nWesley was followed by Mr. Williams, a Welshman, who, it is alleged,\r\nvilified the clergy, and called them dumb dogs that could not bark.\r\nAfter him came a bricklayer; then a plumber and glazier, both sent\r\nfrom London; and, under their preaching, people fell down in fits,\r\nand made strange hideous noises. Malice, spleen, and feuds sprung up.\r\nThe Methodists spoke ill natured things of their lawful minister, and\r\ntold the members of the Church of England, that they would all be\r\ndamned. These things, it is said, exasperated ignorant people, and\r\nwere the principal cause of the subsequent disturbances.[489] Wesley\r\npaid a second visit to Wednesbury on the 15th of April, and says, “the\r\ninexcusable folly of Mr. Williams had so provoked Mr. Egginton, that\r\nhis former love was turned into bitter hatred.” Wesley went to church,\r\nwhere Egginton delivered, with great bitterness of voice and manner,\r\nwhat Wesley pronounced, the most wicked sermon he ever heard; and, two\r\ndays afterwards, while he himself was preaching, a neighbouring parson,\r\nwho was extremely drunk, after using many unseemly and bitter words,\r\ntried to ride over his congregation.\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley came on the 20th of May, and found the society increased\r\nto above three hundred. “The enemy,” he writes, “rages exceedingly, and\r\npreaches against them. A few have returned railing for railing; but the\r\ngenerality have behaved as the followers of Christ.” A Dissenter had\r\ngiven a piece of ground upon which to build a chapel, and Charles says,\r\n“I consecrated it by a hymn.” He went to Walsal, accompanied by many\r\nof the brethren, singing songs of praise. He preached from the steps\r\nof the market house, the mob roaring, shouting, and throwing stones\r\nincessantly. Many struck him, but none hurt him.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, while a small party of Wednesbury Methodists were\r\nreturning from Darlaston, singing hymns, the Darlaston mob began to\r\npelt them with stones and dirt; while the united mobs of Darlaston,\r\nWalsal, and Bilston smashed the windows of most of the Methodist houses\r\nin Wednesbury, Darlaston, and West Bromwich.[490] In some instances,\r\nmoney was extorted, and in others furniture was broken, spoiled, or\r\nstolen; and even pregnant women were beaten with clubs and otherwise\r\nabused.[491] John Adams, John Eaton, and Francis Ward went to Walsal\r\nfor a warrant to apprehend the rioters. The magistrate, Mr. Persehouse,\r\ntold them they had themselves to blame for the outrage that had been\r\ncommitted, and refused their application.[492] The mob hurled against\r\nthem all sorts of missiles, and when the magistrate was asked to quiet\r\nthese disturbers of the public peace, he swung his hat round his head,\r\nand cried, “Huzza!” Mr. Taylor, the curate of Walsal, came, not to stop\r\nthe outrage, but to encourage the rioters in their violence. One of\r\nthem struck Francis Ward on the eye, and cut it so, that he expected\r\nto lose his sight. He went into a shop and had it dressed, when the\r\nruffians again pursued him, and beat him most unmercifully. He escaped\r\ninto the public house, and was again fetched out, and dragged along the\r\nstreet, and through the public kennels, till he lost his strength, and\r\nwas hardly able to stand erect.\r\n\r\nWesley writes, June 18th: “I received a full account of the terrible\r\nriots which had been in Staffordshire. I was not surprised at all,\r\nneither should I have wondered if, after the advices they had so often\r\nreceived from the pulpit, as well as from the episcopal chair, the\r\nzealous high churchmen had rose and cut all that were Methodists in\r\npieces.”\r\n\r\nHe immediately set out to assist the poor Methodists, as far as he\r\nwas able, and came to Francis Ward’s on the 22nd. After hearing the\r\nstatements of the people, he “thought it best to inquire whether there\r\ncould be any help from the laws of the land”; and rode to Counsellor\r\nLittleton at Tamworth, to ask his opinion on the matter.\r\n\r\nThe mob were still as violent as ever. On the very day before Wesley’s\r\narrival at Francis Ward’s, a large crowd came to the house of John\r\nEaton, who was a constable. John went to the door, with his constable’s\r\nstaff, and began to read the act of parliament against riots; but\r\nstones flew so thick about his head, that he was obliged to leave off\r\nreading and to retire. They then broke all his windows, destroyed the\r\ndoor of his dwelling, and smashed his clock to pieces. On the same\r\nday, two or three of the Methodists were singing a hymn in John Adams’\r\nhouse, when a pack of apprentices came and threw stones through the\r\nwindows. A mob destroyed Jonas Turner’s windows with a club, threw\r\nthree baskets full of stones to break his furniture, and ruthlessly\r\ndragged him along the ground a distance of sixty yards. They went to\r\nMary Turner’s house, at West Bromwich, and hunted her and her two\r\ndaughters with stones and stakes, threatening to knock them on the\r\nhead, and to bury them in a ditch. They came to John Bird’s house,\r\nfelled his daughter, snatched money from his wife, and then broke ten\r\nof his windows, besides destroying sash frames, shutters, chests of\r\ndrawers, doors, and dressers. They took Humphrey Hands by the throat,\r\nswore they would be the death of him, gave him a great swing, and\r\nhurled him on the ground. On rising, they struck him on the eye, and\r\nagain knocked him down. They then smashed all his windows, shivered\r\nmany of his household goods, and broke all the shelves, drawers, pots,\r\nand bottles in his shop, and destroyed almost all his medicines. All\r\nthis happened within a day or two of Wesley’s coming to Francis Ward’s.\r\nIndeed, at this very time, there were in and about Wednesbury more than\r\neighty houses, all of which had their windows damaged, and in many of\r\nwhich not three panes of glass were left unbroken.[493]\r\n\r\nCounsellor Littleton assured Wesley they might have an easy remedy, if\r\nthey resolutely prosecuted, as the law directed; and doubtless this\r\nencouraged John Griffiths and Francis Ward to apply, at the end of\r\nJune, to another magistrate for protection and redress; but, having\r\nstated their case to his worship, he talked to them roughly, made game\r\nof them, refused a warrant, and said, “I suppose you follow these\r\nparsons that come about. I will neither meddle nor make.”\r\n\r\nFor some time, preaching was suspended; and then came Messrs. Graves\r\nand Williams, who, however, confined their preaching to private\r\nhouses.[494] At length, on October 20, Wesley himself again entered\r\nthis wild beasts’ den. At noon, he preached in the centre of the town,\r\nand was not disturbed; but, two or three hours afterwards, while he\r\nwas writing at Francis Ward’s, the mob beset the house, and cried,\r\n“Bring out the minister; we will have the minister!” At Wesley’s\r\nrequest, three of the most furious came into the house, and, after the\r\ninterchange of a few sentences, were perfectly appeased. With these men\r\nto clear the way, Wesley went out, and, standing in the midst of the\r\nsurging mob, asked them what they wanted with him. Some said, “We want\r\nyou to go with us to the justice.” Wesley replied, “That I will, with\r\nall my heart”; and away they went. Before they had walked a mile, the\r\nnight came on, accompanied with heavy rain. Bentley Hall, the residence\r\nof Mr. Lane, the magistrate, was two miles distant. Some pushed\r\nforward, and told Mr. Lane, that they were bringing Wesley before his\r\nworship. “What have I to do with Wesley?” quoth the magistrate; “take\r\nhim back again.” Presently the crowd came up, and began knocking for\r\nadmittance. A servant told them his master was in bed. The magistrate\r\ndeclined to see them, but his son asked their business. A spokesman\r\nanswered, “To be plain, sir, if I must speak the truth, all the fault\r\nI find with him is, that he preaches better than our parsons.” Another\r\nsaid, “Sir, it is a downright shame; he makes people rise at five in\r\nthe morning to sing psalms.[495] What advice would your worship give\r\nus?” “Go home,” said Lane, the younger, “and be quiet.”\r\n\r\nFinding it impossible to obtain an audience of Mr. Lane, they then\r\nhurried Wesley to Walsal, to Mr. justice Persehouse. It was now about\r\nseven o’clock, and, of course, was dark. Persehouse, however, also\r\nrefused to see them, on the ground that, like magisterial Mr. Lane, he\r\nwas gone to bed; and hence there was nothing for it but to trudge back\r\nagain. About fifty of the crowd undertook to be Wesley’s convoy; but,\r\nbefore they had gone more than a hundred yards, the mob of Walsal ran\r\nafter them; some were pelted; others fled; and Wesley was left, alone\r\nand unbefriended, in the hands of the victorious ruffians. Some tried\r\nto seize him by the collar, and to pull him down. A big lusty fellow,\r\njust behind him, struck him several times with an oaken club. Another\r\nrushed through the crowd, lifted his arm to strike, but, on a sudden,\r\nlet it drop, and only stroked Wesley’s head, saying “What soft hair he\r\nhas!” One man struck him on the breast; and another on the mouth, with\r\nsuch force, that the blood gushed out. He was dragged back to Walsal;\r\nand, attempting to enter a large house, the door of which was standing\r\nopen, he was seized by the hair of the head, and hindered. He was then\r\nparaded through the main street, from one end of Walsal to the other.\r\nHere he stood, and asked, “Are you willing to hear me speak?” Many\r\ncried, “No, no! knock out his brains; down with him; kill him at once!”\r\nWesley asked, “What evil have I done? which of you all have I wronged\r\nin word or deed?” Again they cried, “Bring him away, bring him away!”\r\nWesley began to pray; and now a man, who just before headed the mob,\r\nturned and said, “Sir, I will spend my life for you; follow me, and no\r\none shall hurt a hair of your head.” Two or three of his companions\r\njoined him; the mob parted; and these three or four brave ruffians, the\r\ncaptains of the rabble on all occasions, and one of them a prizefighter\r\nin a bear garden, took Wesley and carried him safely through the\r\ninfuriated crowd. He writes: “a little before ten o’clock, God brought\r\nme safe to Wednesbury; having lost only one flap of my waistcoat, and a\r\nlittle skin from one of my hands. From the beginning to the end I found\r\nthe same presence of mind, as if I had been sitting in my own study.\r\nBut I took no thought for one moment before another; only once it came\r\ninto my mind, that, if they should throw me into the river, it would\r\nspoil the papers that were in my pocket. For myself, I did not doubt\r\nbut I should swim across, having but a thin coat and a light pair of\r\nboots.”\r\n\r\nIt is right to add, that, in the midst of all these perils, there were\r\nfour brave Methodists who clung to Wesley, resolved to live or die with\r\nhim, namely, William Sitch, Edward Slater, John Griffiths, and Joan\r\nParks. When Wesley asked William Sitch, what he expected when the mob\r\nseized them, William answered with a martyr’s spirit, “To die for Him,\r\nwho died for us.” And when Joan Parks was asked if she was not afraid,\r\nshe said: “No, no more than I am now. I could trust God for you, as\r\nwell as for myself.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the beginning of Methodism in the “black country.” “The\r\nheathen raged, and the people imagined a vain thing. But He that\r\nsitteth in the heavens laughed; the Lord had them in derision.”\r\nHuman justice there was none; but Divine protection was sufficient.\r\nWesley was carried to the houses of Lane and Persehouse, but these\r\ntwo magisterial worthies refused to see him; and yet, only eight days\r\nbefore, they had the effrontery to issue the following proclamation,\r\nwhich Wesley justly calls one of the greatest curiosities, of the kind,\r\nthat England had ever seen:—\r\n\r\n    “_To all High Constables, Petty Constables, and other of His\r\n    Majesty’s Peace Officers, within the county of Staffordshire,\r\n    and particularly to the Constable of Tipton_:—\r\n\r\n    “Whereas, we, His Majesty’s Justices of the Peace for the said\r\n    county of Stafford, have received information, that several\r\n    disorderly persons, styling themselves Methodist preachers,\r\n    go about raising routs and riots, to the great damage of His\r\n    Majesty’s liege people, and against the peace of our Sovereign\r\n    Lord the King.\r\n\r\n    “These are in His Majesty’s name, to command you, and every\r\n    one of you, within your respective districts, to make diligent\r\n    search after the said Methodist preachers, and to bring him\r\n    or them before some of us His said Majesty’s Justices of the\r\n    Peace, to be examined concerning their unlawful doings.\r\n\r\n    “Given under our hands and seals, this 12th day of October,\r\n    1743.\r\n\r\n    “J. LANE,\r\n    “W. PERSEHOUSE.”[496]\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, however, that, notwithstanding Wesley’s rough\r\nusage, and the pretentiously loyal proclamation of these two unjust\r\njustices, Charles Wesley boldly bearded the lions in their den only\r\nfive days after his brother so miraculously escaped. He found the poor\r\nMethodists “standing fast in one mind and spirit, in nothing terrified\r\nby their adversaries.” He writes: “Never before was I in so primitive\r\nan assembly. We sung praises lustily, and with a good courage; and\r\ncould all set our seal to the truth of our Lord’s saying, ‘Blessed are\r\nthey that are persecuted for righteousness’ sake.’ We assembled before\r\nday to sing hymns of praise to Christ; and, as soon as it was light,\r\nI walked down the town, and preached boldly on Revelation ii. 10. It\r\nwas a most glorious time. Our souls were satisfied as with marrow and\r\nfatness, and we longed for our Lord’s coming to confess us before His\r\nFather and His holy angels.”[497]\r\n\r\nEven this is not all. The clergyman at Darlaston was so struck with\r\nthe meek behaviour of the Methodists, in the midst of suffering, that\r\nhe offered to join the Wesleys in punishing the rioters;[498] while\r\n“honest Munchin,” as he was called, the captain of the rabble, who\r\nfirst came to Wesley’s help and rescued him, was so impressed with his\r\nspirit and behaviour, that he immediately forsook his gang of godless\r\ncompanions, joined the Methodists, and was received, by Charles Wesley,\r\nas a member on trial, only five days after Wesley’s deliverance. “What\r\nthought you of my brother?” asked Charles Wesley of “honest Munchin.”\r\n“Think of him!” said he, “I thought he is a _mon_ of God; and God was\r\non his side, when so _mony_ of us could not kill one _mon_.”\r\n\r\nIt may here be added, that “Munchin” was a nickname only,—a provincial\r\nword expressive of coarse, brutal strength. The real name of Wesley’s\r\ndeliverer was George Clifton. He lived in a small house at the foot\r\nof Holloway Bank, and never tired of telling, in after days, how\r\nGod stayed his hand, when he nearly took Wesley’s life. He died in\r\nBirmingham, at the age of eighty-five, in the year 1789, and was buried\r\nin St. Paul’s churchyard. It is a notable incident[499] that, while\r\nWesley’s persecutors passed quickly away, nearly all who took joyfully\r\nthe spoiling of their goods, lived, like “honest Munchin,” a long and\r\na peaceful life, and saw their children’s children walking in the fear\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the “Staffordshire riots” did not terminate in October,\r\n1743; and, in order to complete the summary, we must trespass, for a\r\nmoment, on the events of 1744.\r\n\r\nWe learn from the pamphlet already quoted, “Papers giving an account of\r\nthe Rise and Progress of Methodism at Wednesbury and in other parishes\r\nadjacent,” that, after the bold visit of Charles Wesley, Messrs. Graves\r\nand Williams, who, for months past, had preached only in private\r\nhouses, now begun to preach publicly. At Christmas, Whitefield came\r\nand spent several days in preaching in the streets with his accustomed\r\neloquence and power; and then, on February 2, 1744, Charles Wesley\r\nagain entered the field of action. Egginton, the Wednesbury vicar,\r\nhad drawn up a paper, and sent the crier to give notice, that all the\r\nMethodists must sign it, or else their houses would be immediately\r\ndemolished. It was to this effect, “that they would never read, or\r\nsing, or pray together, or hear the Methodist parsons any more.”\r\nSeveral signed through fear; and every one who did was mulcted a penny\r\nto assist in making the rabble drunk.[500]\r\n\r\nThis was not more than about a month before Charles Wesley’s visit.\r\nWhen he came, however, Egginton was dead; but, in the meantime, not a\r\nMethodist in Darlaston had escaped the renewed violence of the vicar’s\r\ngodless mob, except two or three who had bought exemption by giving\r\ntheir purses to the lawless gang. The windows of all the Methodists\r\nwere broken, neither glass, lead, nor frames remaining. Tables, chairs,\r\nchests of drawers, and whatever furniture was not easily removable,\r\nwere dashed in pieces. Feather beds were torn to shreds, and the\r\nfeathers strewed about the rooms[501] in all directions.\r\n\r\nNo craven-hearted parson would have ventured to preach to humanised\r\nfiends like these; and yet these were pre-eminently the men whom the\r\nWesleys tried to benefit and save. At the risk of being murdered, they\r\nfearlessly told them of their sin and danger. More than once they had\r\nhazarded their lives; and now, Charles was in the midst of these\r\nbegrimed ruffians, as courageous as ever. He escaped, but the poor\r\nMethodists were again made to suffer from the more than brutal violence\r\nof their fiendish neighbours.\r\n\r\nOne man’s wife, about Candlemas, was abused in a manner too horrible\r\nto relate; and, because he tried to bring some of the recreants to\r\njustice, his windows were broken; his furniture and tools destroyed;\r\nall his wife’s linen was torn to tatters; his bed and bedstead were\r\ncut; and his Bible and Prayer-Book pulled to pieces. On Shrove Tuesday,\r\nthe house of Francis Ward was forcibly entered, and all his goods\r\nwere stolen. John Darby’s house was broken open, his furniture and\r\nfive stalls of bees destroyed, and his poultry filched. Other houses\r\nwere plundered and injured in like manner. Some of the mob were armed\r\nwith swords, some with clubs, and some with axes. The outrages, if\r\npossible, were even worse than those some months before. One man cut\r\nMary Turner’s bible into fragments with his axe. Another swore he would\r\nbeat out Mrs. Sheldon’s brains with her fire shovel. Joshua Constable\r\nwas attacked by an outrageous gang, his house, in part, pulled down,\r\nhis goods destroyed and stolen, and his wife violently and brutally\r\nassaulted. For six days, in the early part of 1744, this lawless\r\nriot lasted, and the damage done to the property of the Wednesbury\r\nMethodists amounted to a serious sum. Applications for redress were\r\nmade to not fewer than three magistrates, but to no purpose. The\r\ndocument, containing many of the above facts, was drawn up on February\r\n26, 1744 when the persecuted Methodists remark:—“We keep meeting\r\ntogether morning and evening, are in great peace and love with each\r\nother, and are nothing terrified by our adversaries. God grant we may\r\nendure to the end!”[502]\r\n\r\nLeaving the “black country,” we must pass to other scenes of fiendish\r\nviolence, and yet sacred triumph.\r\n\r\nCornwall, at this period, was as imbruted as Staffordshire. Smuggling\r\nwas considered an honourable traffic, and the plunder of shipwrecked\r\nmariners was accounted a lawful prize. Drunkenness was general; and\r\ncockfighting, bullbaiting, wrestling, and hurling were the favourite\r\namusements of the people. Francis Truscott relates that, at the time\r\nwhen the Wesleys first went to Cornwall, there was a village, about\r\nfive miles from Helstone, which was literally without a Bible, and\r\nwhich had, no religious book whatever, except a single copy of the Book\r\nof Common Prayer, kept at the public house. On one occasion, during\r\na terrific storm, when the people feared that the world was ending,\r\nthey fled in consternation to the tavern, that Tom, the tapster, might\r\nsecure them protection by reading them a prayer. Having fallen upon\r\ntheir knees, Tom hastily snatched a well thumbed book; and began, with\r\ngreat pomposity, to read about storms, wrecks, and rafts, until his\r\nmistress, finding that some mistake was made, cried out, “Tom, that is\r\n‘Robin Cruso’!” “No,” said Tom, “it is the Prayer-Book;” and on he went\r\nuntil he came to a description of man Friday, when his mistress again\r\nvociferated that she was certain Tom was reading “Robin Cruso.” “Well,\r\nwell,” said Tom, “suppose I am; there are as good prayers in ‘Robin\r\nCruso’ as in any other book”; and so Tom proceeded, till the storm\r\nabated, and the conscience stricken company dispersed, complacently\r\nbelieving that they had done their duty.[503]\r\n\r\nWhile the people, however, were thus generally sunk in ignorance and\r\nvice, there were a few exceptions. Among these were Catherine Quick and\r\neleven others, at St. Ives, who frequently met together to pray, and\r\nto read Burkitt’s Notes on the New Testament. This godly band of pious\r\npeople was visited by Captain Turner, a Methodist from Bristol; and\r\nthis led Catherine Quick and her associates to invite Wesley to visit\r\nthem.[504]\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley was the first to come. Entering St. Ives, on July 16,\r\nMr. Shepherd met him; the boys of the place gave him a rough salute;\r\nand Mr. Nance made him his welcome guest. The day after his arrival,\r\nhe went to church, where the rector preached a railing sermon against\r\nthe Methodists, or, as he called them, “the new sect, enemies to the\r\nChurch, seducers, troublers, scribes, pharisees, and hypocrites.”\r\nImmediately after being thus religiously regaled, Charles and his\r\ngodly inviters went to the church at Wednock, where Mr. Hoblin, the\r\ncurate, poured out such a hotch-potch of railing and foolish lies as\r\nmight have made even the devil blush. Charles told the preacher, that\r\nhe had been misinformed; upon which his reverence replied, with more\r\ncoarseness than courtesy, “You are a liar,” and then left him. On the\r\nday following, when Charles Wesley went to the market house, at St.\r\nIves, and commenced singing the hundredth psalm, the mob began to beat\r\na drum and shout. Four days later, when he had just named his text, the\r\nsame unruly ruffians rushed upon his congregation, and threatened to\r\nmurder them. The sconces of the room were broken, the windows dashed\r\nin pieces, and the shutters, benches, and, indeed, everything except\r\nthe walls, destroyed. They asseverated, that Charles Wesley should not\r\npreach again, and lifted up their hands and clubs to strike him. The\r\nwomen were beaten, dragged about, and trampled on without mercy; until,\r\nat length, the rascals fell to quarreling among themselves, broke the\r\ntown clerk’s head, and left the room. Two days after, while preaching\r\nat Wednock, the minister’s mob fell upon the congregation, and _swore_\r\nmost horribly, that they would be revenged on them for their taking the\r\npeople from the church, and making such a disturbance on the sabbath\r\nday. Sticks and stones were used, and ten cowardly ruffians attacked\r\none unarmed man, beat him with their clubs, and knocked him to the\r\nground. The day following, at St. Ives, the service was broken up by\r\nthe mob throwing eggs and stones, and swearing they would pull down the\r\nwalls of the room, whose windows, benches, and sconces they had already\r\nruthlessly destroyed. At Pool, on July 26, the churchwarden shouted,\r\nand hallooed, and put his hat to Charles Wesley’s mouth to prevent his\r\npreaching.\r\n\r\nAll these outrages were principally prompted by the parsons, who\r\ncontinually spoke of the Methodists as popish emissaries, and who,\r\nto use the Rev. Mr. Hoblin’s fisticuff language, “ought to be driven\r\naway by blows, and not by arguments.” At length, the mayor of St. Ives\r\nappointed twenty new constables to suppress the rioters by force of\r\narms, “and plainly told Mr. Hoblin, the fire and fagot minister, that\r\nhe would not be perjured to gratify any man’s malice.”\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley came to St. Ives on the 16th of July, and set out, on\r\nhis return to London, on August 8, his brother having summoned him\r\nto attend a conference with the adherents of Whitefield and with the\r\nMoravians. In this way, his labours in Cornwall were interrupted;\r\nbut, a fortnight after, his brother, accompanied by John Nelson, John\r\nDownes, and Mr. Shepherd, succeeded him. Nelson and Downes had but\r\none horse between them, and, hence, rode by turns. They reached St.\r\nIves on August 30, and found the society increased to about a hundred\r\nand twenty, nearly a hundred of whom had found peace with God. John\r\nNelson began to work at his trade as a stonemason; and, as opportunity\r\npermitted, preached at St. Just, the Land’s End, and other places. John\r\nDownes fell ill of a fever, and was unable to preach at all. Wesley\r\nand Nelson slept upon the floor, Wesley using Nelson’s top coat for\r\na pillow, and Nelson using Burkitt’s Notes on the New Testament for\r\nhis. One morning, at three o’clock, after using this hard bed for a\r\nfortnight, Wesley turned over, clapped Nelson on the side, and jocosely\r\nsaid: “Brother Nelson, let us be of good cheer, for the skin is off but\r\none side yet.” Their board also was as hard as their bed. They were\r\ncontinually preaching; but “it was seldom,” says Nelson, “that any\r\none asked us to eat or drink. One day, as we returned from St. Hilary\r\nDowns, Mr. Wesley stopped his horse to pick the blackberries, saying,\r\n‘Brother Nelson, we ought to be thankful, that there are plenty of\r\nblackberries; for this is the best country I ever saw for getting an\r\nappetite, but the worst for getting food.’”[505]\r\n\r\nWesley spent three weeks in Cornwall, leaving Nelson behind him. Upon\r\nthe whole, he had been kindly treated. The mob at St. Ives, it is true,\r\nwelcomed him with a loud huzza; and serenaded him before his window\r\nwith the harmless ditty:—\r\n\r\n    “Charles Wesley is come to town,\r\n    To try if he can pull the churches down.”\r\n\r\nBut, during his stay, the only act of violence he met with was, on one\r\noccasion, when the mob burst into the room at St. Ives, and a ruffian\r\nstruck him on the head.\r\n\r\nOn his way to Cornwall, and also on returning, Wesley preached at\r\nExeter, and visited a lad, and a clergyman in prison, both sentenced to\r\nsuffer death. His vast congregation “in that solemn amphitheatre,” as\r\nhe calls the castle yard, was such an one as he had rarely seen,—“void\r\nboth of anger, fear, and love.” He also preached at the cross in\r\nTaunton, where a man, attempting to make disturbance, so exasperated\r\nthe congregation, that there was a general cry, “Knock the rascal\r\ndown, beat out his brains!” and Wesley had to interfere to prevent his\r\nbeing roughly handled. He likewise paid a flying visit to the Isles\r\nof Scilly, crossing the ocean in a fishing boat, and singing amid the\r\nswelling waves:—\r\n\r\n    “When passing through the watery deep,\r\n      I ask in faith His promised aid;\r\n    The waves an awful distance keep,\r\n      And shrink from my devoted head,\r\n    Fearless their violence I dare;\r\n    They cannot harm,—for God is there.”\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated, that Charles Wesley was summoned from\r\nCornwall to attend a conference in London, consisting of the leading\r\nmen of the three communities,—the Arminian Methodists, the Calvinistic\r\nMethodists, and the Moravians. The object of the conference was,\r\nby mutual explanations and concessions, to cultivate a better\r\nunderstanding with each other; so that the parties might avoid all\r\nunnecessary collision, and unite, as far as was practicable, in\r\nadvancing what they believed to be the work of God. Wesley drew up a\r\nstatement of the questions at issue between himself and Whitefield,\r\nwith the concessions he was prepared to make.[506] Mr. Jackson says,\r\nthe project had its origin with Wesley,[507] and perhaps it had; but,\r\na year before this, John Cennick expressed a wish for the same sort\r\nof meeting. In a letter to Whitefield’s wife, dated May 6, 1742, he\r\nwrites:—“I have had it much impressed upon my mind, that it would be\r\nright in the sight of God, that all our preachers, all Mr. Wesley’s,\r\nand all the Moravian brethren should meet together. Who knows but we\r\nmight unite? Or if not, we might consent in principles as far as we\r\ncan, and love one another. At least, I think all _our_ preachers\r\nshould meet, as the apostles did, often. I know it would be for good;\r\nbut I suspend my judgment to the elder brethren.”[508]\r\n\r\nIt may thus be doubtful whether the proposal for the conference\r\noriginated with Wesley or with Cennick; but, through no fault of\r\nWesley’s, the proposal was abortive. To be present at the conference,\r\nWesley travelled from Newcastle; his brother came all the way from\r\nCornwall; and John Nelson trudged from Yorkshire. But Whitefield, who\r\nwas in London, seems to have declined the invitation; the Moravians\r\nrefused to come; and, though Spangenberg had promised to attend, he\r\nleft England instead of doing so; while James Hutton said, his brethren\r\nhad orders not to confer at all, unless the archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nor the bishop of London, were also present.[509]\r\n\r\nThis was the last attempt at union; but perhaps it suggested to\r\nWesley’s mind the idea of having conferences of his own, which he began\r\nto hold twelve months afterwards.\r\n\r\nNot a little of the time of the two Wesleys was now employed in\r\npastoralizing the societies they had formed in London, Bristol, and\r\nother places. In Bristol, in the month of January, Wesley spoke to each\r\nmember of society, and rejoiced in finding them neither barren nor\r\nunfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. He did the same\r\nat Kingswood, and remarks: “I cannot understand how any minister can\r\nhope ever to give up his account with joy, unless (as Ignatius advises)\r\nhe knows all his flock by name; not overlooking the men servants and\r\nmaid servants.” In London, he and his brother began visiting the\r\nsociety together, on February 2, which they continued from six in the\r\nmorning to six at night, until the visiting was completed. The same\r\npractice was pursued at Newcastle.\r\n\r\nThe London society now consisted of nineteen hundred and fifty members;\r\nand, before the year was ended, it numbered two and twenty hundred.\r\nThis was a large church, gathered within the last four years, and\r\nneeding a more than ordinary amount of pastoral attention. The members\r\nonly, to say nothing of children, servants, and outside hearers, were\r\nalmost sufficient to fill the Foundery chapel twice over. More room\r\nbecame imperative. Without this, it seemed to be impossible to extend,\r\nor even to conserve the work. London had one Methodist chapel already;\r\nbefore the year was ended, it had two others.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, Wesley had the offer of a chapel in West Street,\r\nSeven Dials, which about sixty years before had been built by the\r\nFrench Protestants. He accepted the offer, and opened the chapel, as\r\na Methodist place of worship, on Trinity Sunday, the first service\r\nlasting from ten o’clock till three. At five, he preached again to\r\nan immense congregation at the Great Gardens; then met the leaders;\r\nand after them the bands; and yet, at ten o’clock at night, he was\r\nless weary than when he began his enormous day’s work in the morning.\r\nHere, when in London, he and his brother now regularly officiated on\r\nSunday mornings and evenings, read the liturgy, and administered the\r\nsacraments. The Lord’s supper was celebrated at the morning service on\r\nboth the first and second Sundays of the month, and the attendance was\r\nso numerous, that, in both instances, the service usually lasted at\r\nleast five hours. This was longer than even Wesley thought desirable,\r\nand led him to divide the communicants into three divisions, so that\r\nnot more than about six hundred might communicate on the same occasion.\r\nThese were enormous gatherings, with which those of the present day\r\nwill hardly bear comparison.\r\n\r\nThree months after he took possession of the West Street chapel, Wesley\r\nbecame the occupier of a third, which had been built in Bermondsey,\r\nSouthwark, by a Unitarian. Being vacant, Wesley took it. Some objected\r\nto this. “What!” said a zealous woman, “what! will Mr. Wesley preach at\r\nSnowsfields? Surely not! there is not such another place in London. The\r\npeople there are not men, but devils!” This was just the sort of reason\r\nto induce Wesley, not to stay away, but go. Accordingly, on August 8,\r\nhe opened Snowsfields chapel by preaching from the words—“Jesus said,\r\nThey that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. I came\r\nnot to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”\r\n\r\nWesley did more than this for the London society. Visiting the sick\r\nhe regarded as an imperative Christian duty. Sending them help was not\r\nenough. Besides, to neglect this was not only to neglect a duty, but\r\nto lose a means of grace. “One great reason,” says Wesley, “why the\r\nrich have so little sympathy for the poor, is, because they so seldom\r\nvisit them.” “All,” he adds, “who desire to escape the everlasting\r\nfire, and to inherit the everlasting kingdom, are equally concerned,\r\naccording to their power, to practise this important duty.”[510]\r\nHolding such sentiments, Wesley himself, throughout life, visited\r\nthe poor and the afflicted, to the utmost of his ability; but, of\r\ncourse, as an itinerant evangelist, when he had done his best, much\r\nwas left untouched. Hence, in the year 1743, he appointed in London\r\nvisitors of the sick, as distinct office bearers in his society.[511]\r\nStewards had been appointed already, to receive the contributions of\r\nthe society, which amounted to nearly £8 per week; and to distribute\r\nthem, partly in repairing and paying for chapel premises, partly\r\nin paying debts, partly in other necessary expenses, and partly in\r\nrelieving the afflicted and the poor. The stewards, seven in number,\r\nwere to be frugal; to have no long accounts; to give none, that asked\r\nrelief, either an ill word or an ill look; and to expect no thanks\r\nfrom man. They met together every Thursday morning at six o’clock,\r\nand distributed all the money paid to them up to the previous Tuesday\r\nnight; so that all receipts and disbursements were concluded within\r\nthe week. The stewards, however, soon found a difficulty with regard\r\nto the afflicted. Some were ready to perish before they heard of them;\r\nand, even when they became acquainted with their illness, being persons\r\ngenerally employed in trade, they were unable to visit them as often as\r\nthey wished. To meet this deficiency, Wesley called together the whole\r\nof the London society; showed how impossible it was for the stewards to\r\nvisit all the sick in all parts of the metropolis; desired the leaders\r\nto be more careful in inquiring after sick cases, and in giving early\r\ninformation concerning them; and then appealed to the assembled members\r\nand asked for volunteers for this important work. Numbers cheerfully\r\nresponded, out of whom Wesley selected forty-six, whom he judged to\r\nbe of the most tender, loving spirit. He then divided London into\r\ntwenty-three districts, and arranged that the sick, in each district,\r\nshould be visited, by a couple of visitors, three times every week; and\r\nthat the visitors, besides inquiring into the state of the people’s\r\nsouls, should relieve those of them in want, and should present their\r\naccounts to the stewards weekly. Wesley writes:—\r\n\r\n    “Upon reflection, I saw how exactly, in this also, we had\r\n    copied after the primitive church. What were the ancient\r\n    deacons? What was Phœbe, the deaconess, but such a visitor of\r\n    the sick?”\r\n\r\nFour rules were to be observed:—\r\n\r\n    “1. Be plain and open in dealing with souls. 2. Be mild,\r\n    tender, patient. 3. Be cleanly in all you do for the sick. 4.\r\n    Be not nice.”\r\n\r\nWesley adds, five years afterwards:—\r\n\r\n    “We have ever since had great reason to praise God for His\r\n    continued blessing on this undertaking. Many lives have been\r\n    saved, many sicknesses healed, much pain and want prevented or\r\n    removed. Many heavy hearts have been made glad, many mourners\r\n    comforted; and the visitors have found, from Him whom they\r\n    serve, a present reward for all their labour.”[512]\r\n\r\nThe two thousand members of the London society contributed about £400 a\r\nyear, or, at the rate of a shilling per member per quarter. The Bristol\r\nsociety consisted of seven hundred members, and, after the same ratio,\r\nwould contribute £140 per year. Eight hundred members at Newcastle\r\nwould raise £160; and the societies at Kingswood and other places\r\nmight give £100 additional: thus making the Methodist income, for\r\n1743, something like £800. Out of this, all chapel expenses had to be\r\ndefrayed; a large proportion was given to the afflicted poor; something\r\nwas necessary for the contingent expenses of Wesley’s helpers; and the\r\nremainder,—how much was it?—was perhaps given to the two Wesleys to\r\nmeet some of their own necessary wants. These were the men preying upon\r\nthe pockets of the poor, and making themselves a fortune out of other\r\npeople’s money! Such falsehoods were current, and were not entirely\r\ndisbelieved even by some of Wesley’s own relatives.\r\n\r\nPoor Emily Wesley, a classical scholar, and no mean poet,—after\r\nteaching in a boarding school where she was ill used and worse paid,\r\nand after marrying a poor Quaker, who did little for her, and soon left\r\nher—was now a penniless and dependent widow, maintained entirely by her\r\ntwo brothers, and living at the Foundery. Emily, in a petulant humour,\r\nwrote to her brother John, accusing him of the want of kindness and of\r\nnatural affection, notwithstanding his reputed riches. John, in reply,\r\nwrote one of his most pungent letters, of which the following is a\r\ncopy:—\r\n\r\n    “NEWCASTLE, _June 30, 1743_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR EMILY,—Once, I think, I told you my mind freely before;\r\n    I am constrained to do so once again. You say, ‘From the time\r\n    of my coming to London, till last Christmas, you would not do\r\n    me the least kindness.’ Do I dream, or you? Whose house were\r\n    you in for three months, and upwards? By whose money were you\r\n    sustained? It is a poor case, that I am forced to mention these\r\n    things.\r\n\r\n    “But, ‘I would not take you lodgings in fifteen weeks.’ No, nor\r\n    should I have done in fifteen years. I never once imagined,\r\n    that you expected _me_ to do this! Shall I leave the word of\r\n    God to serve tables? You should know I have quite other things\r\n    to mind; temporal things I shall mind less and less.\r\n\r\n    “‘When I was removed you never concerned yourself about me.’\r\n    That is not the fact. What my brother does, I do. Besides, I\r\n    myself spoke to you abundance of times, before Christmas last.\r\n\r\n    “‘When I was at preaching, you would scarce speak to me.’ Yes;\r\n    at least as much as to my sister Wright, or, indeed, as I did\r\n    to any else at those times.\r\n\r\n    “‘I impute all your unkindness to one principle you hold, that\r\n    natural affection is a great weakness, if not a sin.’ What is\r\n    this principle I hold? That natural affection is a sin? or that\r\n    adultery is a virtue? or that Mahommed was a prophet of God?\r\n    and that Jesus Christ was a son of Belial? You may as well\r\n    impute _all_ these principles to me as _one_. I hold one just\r\n    as much as the other. O Emmy, never let that idle, senseless\r\n    accusation come out of your mouth.\r\n\r\n    “Do you hold that principle, ‘that we ought to be just (_i.\r\n    e._ pay our debts) before we are merciful’? If I held it, I\r\n    should not give one shilling for these two years, either to\r\n    you or any other. And, indeed, I have, for some time, stayed\r\n    my hand; so that I give next to nothing, except what I give to\r\n    my relations. And I am often in doubt with regard to that, not\r\n    whether natural affection be not a sin; but whether it ought\r\n    to supersede common justice. You know nothing of my temporal\r\n    circumstances, and the straits I am in, almost continually; so\r\n    that were it not for the reputation of my great riches, I could\r\n    not stand one week.\r\n\r\n    “I have now done with myself, and have only a few words\r\n    concerning you. You are of all creatures the most unthankful\r\n    to God and man. I stand amazed at you. How little have you\r\n    profited under such means of improvement! Surely whenever\r\n    your eyes are opened, whenever you see your own tempers, with\r\n    the advantages you have enjoyed, you will make no scruple to\r\n    pronounce yourself, (whores and murderers not excepted,) the\r\n    very chief of sinners.—I am, etc.,\r\n\r\n    “JOHN WESLEY.”[513]\r\n\r\nThis is a caustic letter; and yet John Wesley was a loving brother.\r\nFor nearly thirty years afterwards, Emily Harper was a resident in\r\nthe preachers’ house at West Street, was a constant attendant on the\r\nministry of her brothers, and died in peace, at the age of eighty,\r\nabout the year 1772.\r\n\r\nMuch has been already related respecting the Methodist persecutions of\r\n1743; but the whole has not been told. At Newcastle, three Dissenting\r\nministers agreed together to exclude all from the holy communion,\r\nwho would not refrain from attending Wesley’s ministry. One of them\r\npublicly affirmed, that the Methodist preachers were all papists, and\r\nthat their doctrine was Popery. Another preached against them, and\r\nsaid, “Many texts in the Bible are for them; but you ought not to mind\r\nthese texts; for the papists have put them in.” At Cowbridge, in Wales,\r\nwhen Wesley attempted to preach, the mob shouted, cursed, blasphemed,\r\nand threw showers of stones almost without intermission. At Bristol,\r\na clergyman preached, in several of the city churches, against the\r\n_upstart_ Methodists; and was about to do so in the church of St.\r\nNicholas, when, after naming his text, he was seized with a rattling in\r\nhis throat, fell backward against the pulpit door, and, on the Sunday\r\nfollowing, expired. At Egham, Wesley went to church, and listened to\r\none of the most miserable sermons he ever heard; stuffed with dull,\r\nsenseless, improbable lies against those whom the parson complimented\r\nwith the title of “false prophets.”\r\n\r\nAt Sheffield, the ministers of the town so inflamed the people, that\r\nthey were ready to tear the Methodists to pieces. An army officer\r\ndrew his sword, and presented it at Charles Wesley’s breast. The\r\nmeeting-house was ruthlessly demolished, and the mob encouraged by the\r\nconstable. The windows of Mr. Bennett’s house, in which Charles Wesley\r\nlodged, were smashed to atoms; and stones flew thick and fast in all\r\ndirections. Near Barley Hall, a few miles from Sheffield, Charles\r\nWesley and David Taylor were assaulted with a storm of stones, eggs,\r\nand dirt; David was wounded in the head and lost his hat; and the\r\nclothes of his companion were besmeared with filth.[514]\r\n\r\nAt Hampton, in Gloucestershire, the mob threatened to make aprons of\r\nWhitefield’s gown; broke a young lady’s arm; threw Mr. Adams twice\r\ninto a pool of water; seized Whitefield for the purpose of casting\r\nhim into a pit of lime;[515] and, from four in the afternoon till\r\nmidnight, continued rioting, and declaring that no Anabaptists, etc.,\r\nshould preach there, upon pain of being first put into a skin-pit,\r\nand afterwards into a brook. Women were pulled down the stairs by the\r\nhair of their heads; Mr. Williams was twice thrown into a hole full of\r\nnoisome reptiles and stagnant water, and was beaten, and dragged along\r\nthe kennel; while the Methodists, in general, were mobbed to such an\r\nextent, that many expected to be murdered, and hid themselves in holes\r\nand corners, to avoid their enemies.\r\n\r\nAll this was bad enough; but there was something else, perhaps, quite\r\nas painful. The press, in its attacks, became as virulent as ever.\r\nAmong other publications issued, was the following: “The Notions of\r\nthe Methodists fully disproved, with a Vindication of the Clergy of\r\nthe Church of England from their Aspersions. In two Letters to the\r\nRev. Mr. John Wesley. Newcastle: 1743.” In this precious morsel, of\r\nnear a hundred pages, the Methodists are branded as “conceited, vain\r\nboasters,” and “ignorant, giddy, presumptuous enthusiasts.” Wesley is\r\naccused of “compassing sea and land to gain proselytes”; of “making\r\nunwarrantable dissensions in the Church”; and of “prejudicing the\r\npeople, wherever he came, against his brethren the clergy.” “You are,”\r\nwrites this northern pamphleteer, “guilty both of schism and rebellion,\r\nwhich are two very grievous and damnable sins. You are the sower and\r\nringleader of dissension, endeavouring with unwearied assiduity to\r\nset the flock at variance with their ministers and each other. You\r\nassume to yourself great wisdom and high attainments in all spiritual\r\nknowledge; but it requires no depth of understanding, to judge whether\r\nyour character and conduct suit that of the spiritually or carnally\r\nwise man in St. James. You scruple not to accuse the clergy of almost\r\nuniversally teaching devilish doctrine, and of being deceitful workers;\r\nbut, however you may boast of your conversions, you will in the end\r\nrender yourselves the ridicule of mankind. You go from one end of\r\nthe nation to another, lamenting the heresies of your brethren, and\r\ninstilling into the people’s minds, that they are led into errors\r\nby their pastors; when the truth is, you are perverting them with\r\nsolifidian and antinomian blasphemies. Consider, sir, how wicked and\r\nabominable in the sight of God it is for you to misrepresent your\r\nbrethren to the people, in this scandalous manner. The mischief is,\r\nthe giddy multitude, like the Athenians, love to spend their time in\r\nnothing else but hearing some new thing. They are tired with the solid,\r\nplain, and rational way of preaching they have been accustomed to in\r\nthe Church, and think it dry and insipid in comparison of the powerful\r\ncharms of that ecstatic eloquence, those highflown metaphors, those\r\npretty rhymes, those taking gestures, with which you tickle and bewitch\r\nthem. You give a deplorable account of the debt you have contracted\r\nby the building of your meeting-houses; but unless you can bring\r\nbetter proof than you have hitherto done, of the necessity there is to\r\ngive yourself all this trouble and expense, all wise and considerate\r\nmen, without any breach of charity, will look upon subscriptions for\r\ncarrying on your designs, as little less than picking the poor people’s\r\npockets, and robbing them of that which should maintain their families.”\r\n\r\nSuch is a specimen of the malignant slanders cast upon Wesley by this\r\nnorthern clergyman.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated, that the Rev. Henry Piers preached, in\r\n1742, before the clergy of the deanery of Shoreham, a visitation\r\nsermon, which Wesley revised, and which, at the time of its delivery,\r\ngave great offence. The preacher chosen for this office, in 1743,\r\nwas of another stamp; and his sermon also was published, with the\r\nfollowing title: “Of Speaking as the Oracles of God. A Sermon,\r\npreached before the Reverend the Clergy of the Deanery of Shoreham, at\r\nthe Visitation, held in the Parish Church of Farningham, on Thursday,\r\nMay 19, 1743. By John Andrews, M.A., Vicar of that Church.” 8vo, 30\r\npages. The world would have sustained no loss, if Mr. Andrews’ sermon\r\nhad not been printed. The preacher sneers at the fancies of theological\r\nempirics, in one paragraph, and, in the next, speaks of the doctrines\r\nof “justification and regeneration as questions and strifes of words,\r\nwhich profit not.” Mr. Piers’ visitation sermon is attacked on the\r\nsubject of faith; and the assembled clergy of the deanery of Shoreham\r\nare officially informed, that “every one, that is rightly and duly\r\nbaptized, not only receives the outward ordinance, but the inward and\r\nspiritual grace annexed to it.”\r\n\r\nAnother pamphlet, published at this period, was, “A Fine Picture of\r\nEnthusiasm, chiefly drawn by Dr. Scott; with an application to our\r\nmodern Methodists.” 40 pages. Dedicated to the Bishop of London. In\r\nthis miserable _morceau_, we are told, that “there are thousands\r\nflocking after those enthusiasts, Whitefield and Wesley, who appear to\r\nbe deluding crowds of people into a passionate, mechanical religion.”\r\nOne of them, at least, is suspected to be a masked Jesuit; and both\r\nhave courted persecution, but have had a mortifying disappointment.\r\nThe singing of the Methodists is enchanting, and their tunes the most\r\nmelodious that ever were composed for church music; but their hymns\r\nare irrational, and, like their prayers, dwell upon a word, or are\r\nimmediate addresses to the Son of God, and represent Him as much more\r\ncompassionate to the human race than God the Father ever was. “One of\r\nthese artful teachers,” says the writer, “has ordered the tickets for\r\nhis people to be impressed with the crucifix; and this, with their\r\n_confessions_ and other customs, intimates a manifest fondness for the\r\northodox institutions of the Church of Rome. These _modest_ teachers\r\nhave not failed to trumpet their own extraordinary piety and holiness,\r\nas well as their extraordinary knowledge and illumination; and this\r\nhas been done with great effect among the people. Their doctrine has\r\nvery generally occasioned disorder in the passions of their hearers;\r\nthe screamings and convulsions common among them, in their public\r\nassemblies, being called convictions. Vast numbers have gone melancholy\r\namong them. Many have been led to quit their lawful and necessary\r\nemployment; to neglect their husbands, children, and families; and from\r\nuseful members in society have become mopes and visionaries, incapable\r\nof pursuing their proper business, or of supporting themselves with\r\ndecency.”\r\n\r\nA fourth publication, belonging to the year 1743, was “The Progress\r\nof Methodism in Bristol; or, the Methodist Unmasked: wherein the\r\ndoctrines, discipline, policy, divisions, and successes of that\r\nnovel sect are fully detected and properly displayed in Hudibrastick\r\nverse, by an Impartial Hand. To which is added, by way of appendix,\r\nthe Paper-Controversy between Mr. Robert Williams, supported by\r\nThomas Christie, Esq., Recorder of Savannah, and the Rev. Mr. Wesley,\r\nsupported only by his own integrity and assurance. Together with\r\nauthentic extracts, taken from a late narrative of the state of\r\nGeorgia, relating to the conduct of that gentleman during his abode in\r\nthat colony. Bristol: 1743.” 16mo, 72 pages.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, this mendacious pamphlet contains an affidavit,\r\nsworn by Robert Williams before Stephen Clutterbuck, Mayor of Bristol,\r\nto the effect, that two freeholders at Savannah became bail for\r\nWesley’s appearance at the sessions to take his trial, and that he\r\ndishonourably escaped from the colony and left his bondsmen in the\r\nlurch. To this Wesley replied: “Captain Robert Williams, you know in\r\nyour own soul, that every word of this is a pure invention, without\r\none grain of truth from the beginning of it to the end. What amends\r\ncan you ever make, either to God, or to me, or to the world? Into what\r\na dreadful dilemma have you brought yourself! You must either openly\r\nretract an open slander, or you must wade through thick and thin to\r\nsupport it, till that God, to whom I appeal, shall maintain His own\r\ncause, and sweep you away from the earth.”[516]\r\n\r\nWhitefield and Wesley, in this scurrilous production, are accused of\r\npreaching to get money, and of placing men with plates at each gate\r\nand stile of the fields in which they harangued the people, to gather\r\ncollections for the Orphan House in Georgia and the Room in Bristol.\r\nWesley is charged with pretending to work miracles; for, upon a company\r\nof women falling down before him, he first of all prays over them, then\r\nsings a hymn, and then exorcises devils. In the midst of a most severe\r\nwinter, he had taken his converts, early in the morning, through frost\r\nand snow, to the river Froom, at Baptist Mills, where, on the ice being\r\nbroken, he and they went into the water, where, with “limbs shuddering\r\nand teeth _hackering_,” he baptized or dipped them. Class-meetings are\r\ndescribed, the leaders of which note the sins of those who confess to\r\nthem, register them in a book, and, in due season, “report them to\r\nJohn, who admonishes one, reprimands another, and expels a third.”\r\nAt first, each member gave a penny, but now the _lowest_ payment was\r\ntwopence weekly. At present there were forty-eight classes in Bristol,\r\neach class containing “an even dozen.” After the watchnight meetings at\r\nKingswood,\r\n\r\n    “Men, boys, and girls, and women too,\r\n    Come strolling home at morning two:”\r\n\r\nand at the nightly lovefeasts, “the ghostly father and all his sons\r\ndraw near—\r\n\r\n    “The pious sisters, wives, and misses,\r\n    And greet them well with holy kisses.”\r\n\r\nBut enough of this. What did Wesley himself publish in 1743?\r\n\r\n1. “Nature, Design, and General Rules of the United Societies,\r\nin London, Bristol, Kingswood, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne.\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne: printed by John Gooding, on the Side. Price one\r\npenny. 1743.” Twelve pages.\r\n\r\nThis, the first edition of the “Rules,” is signed by John Wesley only,\r\nand bears date February 23, 1743. A second edition was issued, signed\r\nby both John and Charles Wesley, and dated May 1, 1743. The first\r\nedition has annexed “A Prayer for those who are convinced of Sin,”\r\nconsisting of eighteen stanzas of four lines each, and from which is\r\ntaken the beautiful hymn, numbered 462, in the Wesleyan Hymn-Book,\r\nand beginning with the line, “O let the prisoners‘mournful’ cries”;\r\na production admirably appropriate to the circumstances in which the\r\nmembers of the first Methodist societies were placed.\r\n\r\nSocieties cannot exist without rules. Up to the present, Wesley\r\nhad regulated his societies by _vivâ voce_ instructions and direct\r\nauthority; but, as the Methodists increased and multiplied, this became\r\nmore difficult, and hence the publication now mentioned. The Rules were\r\nboth written and published at Newcastle upon Tyne. Eleven days after\r\nthe date they bear, Wesley read them to the Newcastle society, and\r\ndesired the members seriously to consider whether they were willing\r\nto observe them. The careful reader will remark the designation which\r\nWesley gives to his societies, as well as his description of their\r\n“nature and design.” They are not “Wesleyan,” or “Methodist,” but\r\n“United Societies.” As compared with the rules now in use, there are\r\na few variations in the original edition deserving of being noticed.\r\nFor instance, in the list of the leader’s duties, the first in order\r\nwas, to receive from each person in his class, once a week, what the\r\nmembers were willing to give toward _the relief of the poor_. This\r\nis now altered thus: “to receive what they are willing to give for\r\nthe _support of the gospel_.” The present rule forbidding “_brother_\r\ngoing to law _with brother_,” in the first and several subsequent\r\neditions, simply read, “going to law.” To the original rule, “the\r\ngiving or taking things on usury,” has been added the words, “that\r\nis, unlawful interest;” and to the rule prohibiting “uncharitable or\r\nunprofitable conversation,” there was added, in the fourth edition,\r\npublished in 1744, “especially, speaking evil of ministers or those in\r\nauthority,” words now changed for “magistrates or ministers.” In the\r\nlist of things forbidden in the present Rules, is the important one,\r\n“borrowing without a probability of paying; or taking up goods without\r\na probability of paying for them;” this is not in the first editions.\r\nAnd among the duties enjoined is “_family_ and private prayer”; but in\r\nthe first edition the word _family_ is not found, though, in the fourth\r\nedition, published twelve months afterwards, it was inserted.\r\n\r\nThe curious reader will forgive these trifles. They are all the\r\nvariations found in the first edition of the Rules, as compared with\r\nthe Rules now in use. The Rules themselves are too well known to\r\nrequire insertion.\r\n\r\n2. Another of Wesley’s publications, in 1743, was “A Word in Season;\r\nor, Advice to a Soldier.” 12mo, six pages. This is a model tract, and\r\nshows that, from the first, soldiers excited Wesley’s sympathy.\r\n\r\n3. “Thoughts on Marriage and Celibacy.” 12mo, twelve pages. A strange\r\nproduction, substantially embodied in the piece in Wesley’s collected\r\nworks, entitled, “Thoughts on a Single Life” (see vol. xxiv., page\r\n252, orig. edit.). What shall we say of this? Wesley admits, that\r\nthe popish doctrine forbidding to marry is a doctrine of devils, and\r\nthat a person may be as holy in a married as in a single state; but\r\nhe proceeds to show, that the happy few who have power to abstain\r\nfrom marriage are free from a thousand nameless domestic trials which\r\nare found sooner or later in every family. They are at liberty from\r\nthe greatest of all entanglements, the loving one creature above all\r\nothers; they have leisure to improve themselves; and, having no wife or\r\nchildren to provide for, may give all their worldly substance to God.\r\nThose highly favoured celibates are exhorted to prize the advantages\r\nthey enjoy, and to be careful to keep them; they are to avoid all\r\nneedless conversation, much more all intimacy with those of the other\r\nsex; all softness and effeminacy; all delicacy and needless self\r\nindulgence; and all sloth, inactivity, and indolence. They are to sleep\r\nno more than nature requires; to use as much bodily exercise as they\r\ncan; to fast, and practise self denial; to wait upon the Lord without\r\ndistraction; and to give all their time and their money to God. On the\r\nwhole, without disputing whether the married or single life is the more\r\nperfect state. Wesley concludes by adding, “We may safely say, Blessed\r\nare they who abstain from things lawful in themselves, in order to be\r\nmore devoted to God.”\r\n\r\nThirty years afterwards, when Wesley was twitted for marrying, after\r\nexpressing such opinions, he averred, that his opinions with regard\r\nto the advantages of a single life were still unchanged; and that he\r\nentered the married state “for reasons best known to himself.”[517]\r\nThis was a lame reply to a reasonable reflection on inconsistency.\r\nWesley’s tract was a mistake; or, if not, Wesley ought to have adopted\r\nhis own principles, and have lived and died a celibate.\r\n\r\n4. In July, 1743, Wesley wrote his “Instructions for Children,” which\r\nreached a second edition in 1745, 12mo, 38 pages. Prefixed, was a\r\npreface, addressed “to all parents and schoolmasters,” stating, that\r\na great part of the tract was translated from the French, and that it\r\ncontained “the true principles of the Christian education of children,”\r\nand that these “should in all reason be instilled into them, as soon as\r\nthey can distinguish good from evil.”\r\n\r\nThe first twelve lessons are a catechism, respecting God, the creation\r\nand the fall of man, man’s redemption, the means of grace, hell, and\r\nheaven. Then follow lessons how to regulate our desires, understanding,\r\njoy, and practices.\r\n\r\nRepenting is defined as “being thoroughly convinced of our sinfulness,\r\nguilt, and helplessness”; faith in Christ, as “a conviction that Christ\r\nhas loved _me_ and given Himself for _me_;” holiness, as “the love of\r\nGod and of all mankind for God’s sake.” Wesley asserts that “they who\r\nteach children to love praise, train them for the devil”; and that\r\n“fathers and mothers who give children everything they like, are the\r\nworst enemies they have.”\r\n\r\nWesley considered these “Instructions for Children,” extracted from\r\nAbbé Fleury and M. Poiret, superior, “for depth of sense and plainness\r\nof language, to anything in the English tongue.”[518] The Church\r\nCatechism he declared to be “utterly improper for children of six or\r\nseven years old,” and thought “it would be far better to teach them the\r\nshort catechism, prefixed to the ‘Instructions.’”[519] Accordingly, he\r\nrequested all his preachers to give children the “Instructions,” and to\r\nencourage them in committing the book to memory; while they themselves\r\nwere to make it the subject of special study.[520]\r\n\r\nWesley’s attention to children is proverbial. “When I was a child,”\r\nsaid Robert Southey, “I was in a house, in Bristol, where Wesley was.\r\nOn running downstairs before him, with a beautiful little sister of my\r\nown, he overtook us on the landing, when he lifted my sister in his\r\narms and kissed her. Placing her on her feet again, he then put his\r\nhand upon my head, and blessed me; and I feel,” continued the bard, his\r\neyes glistening with tears, and yet in a tone of grateful and tender\r\nrecollection, “I feel as though I had the blessing of that good man\r\nupon me still.”[521]\r\n\r\nIn Wesley’s well known sermon on “Family Religion,” he lays it down\r\nthat “the wickedness of children is generally owing to the fault or\r\nneglect of their parents.” The souls of children ought to be fed as\r\noften as their bodies. Methodists are exhorted not to send their sons\r\n“to any of the large public schools (for they are nurseries of all\r\nmanner of wickedness), but to a private school, kept by some pious man,\r\nwho endeavours to instruct a small number of children in religion and\r\nlearning together.” He raises the same objection to “large boarding\r\nschools” for girls; for “in these seminaries, the children teach one\r\nanother pride, vanity, affectation, intrigue, artifice, and, in short,\r\neverything which a Christian woman ought not to learn.” He adds: “I\r\nnever yet knew a pious, sensible woman, that had been bred at a large\r\nboarding school, who did not aver, one might as well send a young maid\r\nto be bred in Drury Lane.”[522]\r\n\r\nThis is sweeping language; but at that period it was not without truth.\r\n\r\n5. Another of Wesley’s publications, in 1743, was, “A Practical\r\nTreatise on Christian Perfection. Extracted from a late author.” 12mo,\r\n115 pages. This was an abridgment of William Law’s pungent book,\r\npublished in 1726.\r\n\r\n6. Another was an abridgment of Bunyan’s “Pilgrim’s Progress,” 12mo, 49\r\npages, price fourpence. Little did Wesley think that, within a hundred\r\nyears, the whole of the glorious dreamer’s immortal work would be sold\r\nfor a fourth of the price charged for his own fragment.\r\n\r\n7. Wesley’s last, and most important work, which reached a second\r\nedition in the year it was published, was “An Earnest Appeal to Men of\r\nReason and Religion,” 12mo, 53 pages.[523]\r\n\r\nThis was a clarion cry which created greater consternation than\r\never in the camp of Wesley’s enemies. First of all, he describes\r\nreligion—the faith by which it is attained—and its reasonableness.\r\nThen, turning from those who do not receive the Christian system to\r\nthose who say they do, he charges them, in the name of God, either to\r\nprofess themselves infidels, or to _be_ Christians; either to cast\r\noff the Bible, or their sins. “A common swearer, a sabbath breaker, a\r\nwhoremonger, a drunkard, who says he believes the Scripture is of God,\r\nis a monster upon earth, the greatest contradiction to his own, as\r\nwell as to the reason of all mankind.” After this, Wesley replies to\r\nthe objections raised against Methodist doctrines, and to the calumny,\r\nthat he and his coadjutors were papists in disguise, undermining the\r\nChurch, and making preaching the means of replenishing their purses.\r\nIt had been reported, that he received £1300 a year at the Foundery\r\nonly, over and above what he received from Bristol, Kingswood,\r\nNewcastle, and other places. To this he answers, that the moneys given\r\nby the Methodists never come into his hands at all; but are received\r\nand expended by the stewards, in relieving the poor, and in buying,\r\nerecting, or repairing chapels; and that, so far from there being any\r\noverplus when this was done, he himself, at this moment, was in debt\r\nto the amount of £650, on account of the meeting-houses in London,\r\nBristol, and Newcastle. He had “deliberately thrown up his ease, most\r\nof his friends, his reputation, and that way of life which of all\r\nothers was most agreeable both to his natural temper and education; he\r\nhad toiled day and night, spent all his time and strength, knowingly\r\ndestroyed a firm constitution, and was hastening into weakness, pain,\r\ndiseases, death,—to gain a debt of six or seven hundred pounds.” Then\r\naddressing himself to his brother clergy, he asks:—\r\n\r\n    “For what price will you preach eighteen or nineteen times\r\n    every week; and this throughout the year? What shall I give you\r\n    to travel seven or eight hundred miles, in all weathers, every\r\n    two or three months? For what salary will you abstain from all\r\n    other diversions than the doing good, and the praising God? I\r\n    am mistaken if you would not prefer strangling to such a life,\r\n    even with thousands of gold and silver.\r\n\r\n    “I will now simply tell you my sense of these matters, whether\r\n    you will hear or whether you will forbear. Food and raiment\r\n    I have; such food as I choose to eat, and such raiment as I\r\n    choose to put on: I have a place where to lay my head: I have\r\n    what is needful for life and godliness: and I apprehend this is\r\n    all the world can afford. The kings of the earth can give me\r\n    no more. For as to gold and silver, I count it dung and dross;\r\n    I trample it under my feet; I esteem it just as the mire of\r\n    the streets. I desire it not; I seek it not; I only fear lest\r\n    any of it should cleave to me, and I should not be able to\r\n    shake it off before my spirit returns to God. I will take care\r\n    (God being my helper), that none of the accursed thing shall\r\n    be found in my tents when the Lord calleth me hence. Hear ye\r\n    this, all you who have discovered the treasures which I am to\r\n    leave behind me; if I leave behind me £10,—above my debts and\r\n    my books, or what may happen to be due on account of them,—you\r\n    and all mankind bear witness against me, that I lived and died\r\n    a thief and a robber.”\r\n\r\nWesley kept his word; for, within twelve months of his decease, he\r\nclosed his cash-book with the following words, written with a tremulous\r\nhand, so as to be scarcely legible:—“For upwards of eighty-six years, I\r\nhave kept my accounts exactly; I will not attempt it any longer, being\r\nsatisfied with the continual conviction, that I save all I can, and\r\ngive all I can; that is, all I have.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1744.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1744 Age 41]\r\n\r\nWesley spent more than half of the year 1744 in London and its\r\nimmediate neighbourhood. He made about half-a-dozen visits to Bristol;\r\nand three months were occupied in a tour to Cornwall, thence to\r\nYorkshire and Newcastle, and thence to London.\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley spent the year in London, Bristol, Cornwall,\r\nStaffordshire, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, at Newcastle, Nottingham,\r\nSheffield, and other intervening places.\r\n\r\nWhitefield commenced the year with rejoicing over the birth of his\r\nfirstborn,—a boy expected to be a minister, and publicly baptized in\r\nthe Tabernacle, where thousands, on the occasion, joined in singing\r\na doggrel hymn, written by an aged and doting widow. On the 8th of\r\nFebruary, this infant prodigy suddenly expired in the Bell Inn,\r\nGloucester, where Whitefield himself was born; and, after being taken\r\nto the church in which Whitefield was baptized, first communicated, and\r\nfirst preached, was then buried, Whitefield returning to London deeply\r\npondering the meaning of what he calls “this blessed riddle.” The next\r\nfour months were chiefly spent in the metropolis; after which he and\r\nhis wife repaired to Plymouth for the purpose of sailing to America.\r\nHere they were detained for several weeks, waiting for the convoy in\r\nwhose company the voyage was to be attempted. During the interval,\r\nWhitefield preached in the town and neighbourhood with great success,\r\nand was nearly murdered by a villain, who beat him most unmercifully\r\nwith his golden-headed cane. At length, he set sail in company with\r\nnearly one hundred and fifty ships; and, after not a few adventures,\r\nlanded in New England, at the end of October, but was so extremely ill,\r\nthat, for several weeks, he was almost incapable of preaching. In point\r\nof fact, Whitefield preached but very little, during the year 1744,\r\nexcept in London and in Plymouth, and in their respective vicinities.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief events of 1744 was the threat of a French invasion.\r\nOn the 15th of February, the king sent a message to the houses of\r\nparliament, to the effect, that he had received undoubted intelligence,\r\nthat the eldest son of the pretender to his crown was arrived in\r\nFrance, and that preparations were being made to invade England.\r\n\r\nParliament replied, that they looked upon such a design with the\r\ngreatest indignation and abhorrence, and would use every effort to\r\nfrustrate and defeat so desperate and insolent an attempt.\r\n\r\nGreat excitement followed. The coast was watched with the utmost care.\r\nA double guard was mounted at the Tower, and also at St. James’s. All\r\nmilitary officers were ordered to their posts of duty. Workmen in the\r\nking’s yards were directed to wear arms and accoutrements, and to be\r\nexercised every morning; and instructions were given to the militia\r\nof the county of Kent, to assemble at the earliest notice.[524] The\r\nHabeas Corpus act was suspended, and a proclamation was issued for a\r\ngeneral fast. All papists and reputed papists were forbidden to remain\r\nwithin ten miles of the cities of Westminster and London. The Earl of\r\nBarrymore was arrested and committed to the Tower, on the charge of\r\nenlisting men for the Pretender. Loyal addresses were presented to the\r\nking by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, by the merchants\r\nof London, by the convocation of the province of Canterbury, by the\r\nQuakers, by the Protestant Dissenters, and by many others. The city\r\nof Dublin offered a reward of £6000 for apprehending the Pretender,\r\nor his son, either alive or dead, should they attempt to land in\r\nIreland; and sixty thousand fire arms and accoutrements were seized in\r\nsuspected houses in the southern parts of that island. War was declared\r\nagainst France on the 29th of March, and the whole kingdom seemed to be\r\ninflamed with martial ardour.\r\n\r\nHow did this affect Wesley? Two days after the king informed parliament\r\nof the threatened invasion, Wesley and his London society held a day\r\nof solemn fasting and prayer. When the proclamation was published\r\nrequiring all papists to leave London, though he had appointed to go\r\nout of town, he determined to stay, so as to cut off all occasion\r\nof reproach; but on the 2nd of March (the last day mentioned in the\r\nproclamation), while he was at a house in Spitalfields, a magistrate\r\nand the parish officers came in search of papists. Wesley was glad of\r\nthe opportunity to explain the principles and the practices of the\r\nMethodists. The searchers were satisfied, and Wesley was allowed to\r\ndepart in peace, a large mob merely gaping, staring, and hallooing\r\nas loud as they were able. Some of his friends pressed him to write\r\nan address to the king, on behalf of the Methodists. He did so,\r\nand described them as “a people scattered and peeled, and trodden\r\nunderfoot; traduced as inclined to Popery, and consequently disaffected\r\nto his majesty.” They were, however, “a part of the Protestant Church\r\nestablished in these kingdoms; they detested the fundamental doctrines\r\nof the Church of Rome; and were steadily attached to his majesty’s\r\nroyal person and illustrious house, and ready to obey him to the\r\nuttermost, in all things which they conceived to be agreeable to the\r\nwritten word of God.” “Silver and gold,” he adds, “most of us must\r\nown, we have none; but such as we have we humbly beg your majesty to\r\naccept, together with our hearts and prayers.” Charles Wesley objected\r\nto the sending of this address _in the name of the Methodists_, because\r\nit would constitute them a sect, or at least would _seem to allow_\r\nthat they were a body distinct from the national Church. He wished his\r\nbrother to guard against this, and then, in the name of the Lord, to\r\naddress the king.[525] Upon further consideration the address was laid\r\naside.\r\n\r\nWesley’s troubles were not ended. On the 20th of March, he received\r\na summons from the Surrey magistrates, to appear at the court at St.\r\nMargaret’s Hill. He did so, and asked, “Has any one anything to lay to\r\nmy charge?” None replied; but, at length, one of the magistrates said,\r\n“Sir, are you willing to take the oaths to his majesty, and to sign\r\nthe declaration against Popery?” Wesley replied, “I am”; which he did\r\naccordingly, and was permitted to depart in peace.\r\n\r\nWhy was this? Besides the general calumny cast upon the Methodists,\r\nthat they were papists, it was at this time currently reported, that\r\nWesley had recently been seen with the Pretender in France. Might not\r\nthis be the reason of the unnecessary and annoying summons to appear at\r\nSt. Margaret’s Hill?\r\n\r\nIn the same month, a warrant was issued, by a magistrate of the west\r\nriding of Yorkshire, to compel the attendance of five witnesses to\r\ngive evidence at Wakefield, that they had heard Charles Wesley speak\r\n“treasonable words, as praying for the banished, or for the Pretender.”\r\nAt the time appointed, March 15, Charles himself appeared in the\r\nmagisterial court, and engaged to prove, that all the Methodists, “to\r\na man, were true members of the Church of England, and loyal subjects\r\nof his majesty, King George”; and then desired their worships to\r\nadminister to him the oaths. All the summoned witnesses retracted\r\ntheir accusations; and yet the Methodist itinerant was insulted at\r\nthe door of the magistrates’ room, for eight long hours, when Mr.\r\njustice Burton, with consummate coolness, told him he might go,\r\nfor they had nought against him. “Sir,” said Charles, “that is not\r\nsufficient: I cannot depart till my character is cleared. It is no\r\ntrifling matter. Even my life is concerned in the charge.” At length,\r\ntheir worships reluctantly acknowledged, in explicit terms, that his\r\n“loyalty was unquestionable”; and he took his leave for Birstal, where\r\nthe Methodists of the neighbourhood met him on a hill, and joined him\r\nin singing “praises lustily, and with a good courage.” All this arose\r\nout of one of the witnesses having heard him praying, on the 12th of\r\nFebruary, that “the Lord would call home His banished”; the words being\r\nused, of course, in a sense purely spiritual.\r\n\r\nOther inconveniences and acts of violence arose out of the threatened\r\ninvasion of the French. John Slocomb, a poor baker’s boy, who was now\r\none of Wesley’s preachers in Cornwall, was arrested, under a press\r\nwarrant, and taken by his own uncle to prison, where he was kept a\r\nweek, and then brought before the commissioners, who, finding no\r\ncause to punish or detain him, were obliged, at last, notwithstanding\r\nall their threatenings, to let him go. In Nottingham, two other\r\npreachers, John Healey and Thomas Westall, were similarly arrested,\r\nthe magistrates demanding their horses for the king’s service, and\r\nrefusing to believe they had none till they sent and searched. The\r\ncase of John Nelson is known to every one, and will ever stand as one\r\nof the most sublime and tragic chapters in Methodistic history. John\r\nDownes, another itinerant, while preaching at Epworth, was seized and\r\npressed for the king’s service, and sent as a prisoner to Lincoln\r\ngaol. And then, to all these must be added the mournful case of Thomas\r\nBeard, a quiet and peaceable man, who was torn from his trade, and wife\r\nand children, in Yorkshire, and sent away as a soldier, for no other\r\ncrime, either committed or pretended, than that of calling sinners to\r\nrepentance; and who, while lodged in the hospital at Newcastle, died;\r\nand, as one of the first martyrs among the Methodists, escaped from his\r\ncruel enemies on earth, to the company of the beatified in heaven.\r\n\r\nThus did the hot-headed friends of King George II. do their utmost to\r\nmake leal Methodists disloyal to the throne and house of Hanover; but\r\nthe effort failed; for, from first to last, more faithful subjects\r\nthan Wesley’s followers the throne of England has never had. “It is\r\nmy religion,” wrote Wesley, more than thirty years after this, “which\r\nobliges me to put men in mind to be subject to principalities and\r\npowers. Loyalty is with me an essential branch of religion, and which I\r\nam sorry any Methodist should forget. There is the closest connection,\r\ntherefore, between my religious and political conduct; the selfsame\r\nauthority enjoining me to fear God, and to honour the king.”[526]\r\n\r\nTwo events occurred, in the year 1744, which deserve special mention:\r\nthe first Methodist conference, and Wesley’s last university sermon.\r\n\r\nThe conference began on Monday, June 25, and continued the five\r\nfollowing days. It was held at the Foundery, London; and consisted\r\nof the two Wesleys, and four other clergymen, namely, John Hodges,\r\nHenry Piers, Samuel Taylor, and John Meriton; also of four lay\r\npreachers—Thomas Richards, Thomas Maxfield, John Bennet, and John\r\nDownes.[527]\r\n\r\nMr. Hodges was the rector of Wenvo, in Wales, a good man, who, from\r\nthe first, was friendly to the Methodists, and who showed his love for\r\nWesley, in 1758, by writing him a reproof for the tartness of some of\r\nhis controversial writings, and which Wesley had the honest manliness\r\nto publish in his _Arminian Magazine_.\r\n\r\nMr. Piers has been already noticed. Samuel Taylor was the great\r\ngreat grandson of the celebrated Dr. Rowland Taylor, of Hadleigh, in\r\nSuffolk, who was forcibly ejected from his church; whom Gardiner, from\r\nthe woolsack, addressed as “a knave, a traitor, and a villain”; whom\r\nBonner was about to strike with his crosier, and was only hindered by\r\nTaylor telling him he would strike again; and who, amid the tears and\r\nprayers of his afflicted flock, was put into a pitch barrel, by the\r\nbloodthirsty papists, on the 9th of February, 1555, and was set on\r\nfire, one zealous vagabond flinging a fagot at his head, and another\r\nimpatient ruffian cleaving his skull with a halbert, while he was\r\nsinging in the flames, “In God have I put my trust, I will not fear\r\nwhat man can do unto me.” The descendant of this brave-hearted martyr\r\npartook of his ancestor’s zealous and heroic spirit. He was vicar of\r\nQuinton in Gloucestershire; but his heart was larger than his parish.\r\nLike Wesley, he went out into the highways and hedges, and was a sharer\r\nin the brutal persecutions of Wednesbury, Darlaston, and other places.\r\nRichard Whatcoat, one of the first Methodist bishops in America, when\r\na child, sat under his ministry, and received impressions which he\r\nnever lost.[528] As a preacher, Mr. Taylor was zealous, pathetic, and\r\npowerful. He died about the year 1750.[529]\r\n\r\nMr. Meriton had been educated in one of the universities, and was now\r\na clergyman from the Isle of Man.[530] The last years of his life seem\r\nto have been chiefly spent in accompanying the two Wesleys in their\r\npreaching excursions, and in assisting them in the chapels they had\r\nbuilt. He died in 1753.\r\n\r\nOf the four lay members of the first Methodist conference, three\r\nafterwards left Wesley, and became ministers of other churches. John\r\nDownes was the only one who lived and died a Methodist.\r\n\r\nThe day before the conference commenced was one to be remembered.\r\nBesides the ordinary preaching services, a lovefeast was held, at which\r\nsix ordained ministers were present; and, during the day, the sacrament\r\nwas administered to the whole of the London society, now numbering\r\nbetween two and three thousand members. At this grand sacramental\r\nservice five clergymen assisted.\r\n\r\nOn the day following, the conference was opened, with solemn prayer, a\r\nsermon by Charles Wesley, and the baptism of an adult, who there and\r\nthen found peace with God.[531] The three points debated were:—1. What\r\nto teach. 2. How to teach. 3. How to regulate doctrine, discipline, and\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the first point, it was settled that, to be justified\r\nis to be pardoned, and received into God’s favour; that faith,\r\npreceded by repentance, is the condition of justification; that\r\nrepentance is a conviction of sin; that faith, in general, is a Divine,\r\nsupernatural _elenchos_ of things not seen; and that justifying faith\r\nis a conviction, by the Holy Ghost, that Christ loved me, and gave\r\nHimself for me; that no man can be justified and not know it; that the\r\nimmediate fruits of justifying faith are peace, joy, love, power over\r\nall outward sin, and power to keep down inward sin; that wilful sin is\r\ninconsistent with justifying faith; that no believer need ever again\r\ncome into condemnation; that works are necessary for the continuance\r\nof faith, which cannot be lost but for want of them; and that St. Paul\r\nand St. James do not contradict each other, when one says Abraham was\r\nnot justified by works, and the other that he was, because they do not\r\nspeak of the same justification, and because they do not speak of the\r\nsame works,—St. Paul speaking of works that precede faith, and St.\r\nJames of works that spring from it.\r\n\r\nThe Conference further agreed, that Adam’s sin is imputed to all\r\nmankind in the sense, that in consequence of such sin—(1) our bodies\r\nare mortal; (2) our souls disunited from God, and of a sinful, devilish\r\nnature; and (3) we are liable to death eternal. It was further\r\nagreed, that the Bible never expressly affirms, that God imputes the\r\nrighteousness of Christ to any, but rather, that faith is imputed\r\nto us for righteousness. At the same time, the Conference conceived\r\nthat, by the merits of Christ, all men are cleared from the guilt\r\nof Adam’s actual sin; that their bodies will become immortal after\r\nthe resurrection; that their souls receive a capacity of spiritual\r\nlife, and an actual spark or seed thereof; and that all believers are\r\nreconciled to God and made partakers of the Divine nature.\r\n\r\nSanctification was defined, a renewal in the image of God, in\r\nrighteousness and true holiness; to be a _perfect Christian_ is to love\r\nthe Lord our God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength, implying\r\nthe destruction of all inward sin; and faith is the condition and\r\ninstrument by which such a state of grace is obtained.\r\n\r\nProceeding to other matters, the Conference resolved to defend the\r\ndoctrine of the Church of England both by their preaching and living;\r\nto obey the bishops in all things indifferent, and to observe the\r\ncanons as far as they could with a safe conscience; and, finally, to\r\nexert themselves to the utmost not to entail a schism in the Church,\r\nby their hearers forming themselves into a distinct sect; though they\r\nagreed that they must not neglect the present opportunity of saving\r\nsouls, for fear of consequences which might possibly or probably\r\nhappen, after they were dead.\r\n\r\nThe belief was expressed, that the design of God in raising up\r\nthe preachers, called Methodists, was to reform the nation, more\r\nparticularly the Church; and to spread scriptural holiness through\r\nthe land. It was decided that, wherever they preached, they ought to\r\nendeavour to form societies, because where societies were not formed,\r\nthe preacher would not be able to give proper instructions to them\r\nthat were convinced of sin; nor the people to watch over one another\r\nin love, bear one another’s burdens, and build up each other in faith\r\nand holiness. It was stated, that the Methodists were divided into\r\nfour sections; namely, the united societies, the bands, the select\r\nsocieties, and the penitents. The united societies, who were the most\r\nnumerous, consisted of awakened persons. The bands were selected from\r\nthese, and consisted of those who were supposed to have remission of\r\nsins. The select societies were taken from the bands, and were composed\r\nof those who seemed to walk in the light of God’s countenance. The\r\npenitents were those who, for the present, were fallen from grace.\r\nAfter this, the rules of the united societies, and of the bands, were\r\nread. The rules of the select societies were the same as those of the\r\nbands, with three additions:—1. That nothing spoken in their meetings\r\nbe spoken again. 2. That every member submit to his minister in all\r\nindifferent things. 3. That, till they could have all things common,\r\nevery member should bring, once a week, all he could spare toward a\r\ncommon stock. The penitents were left without rules.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed, that lay assistants were allowable only in cases of\r\nnecessity. They were to expound every morning and evening; to meet the\r\nunited societies, the bands, the select societies, and the penitents,\r\nonce a week; to visit the classes once a quarter; to hear and decide\r\nall differences; to put the disorderly back on trial, and to receive on\r\ntrial for the bands or society; to see that the stewards, the leaders,\r\nschoolmasters, and housekeepers faithfully discharged their several\r\noffices; and to meet the leaders and the stewards weekly, and to\r\nexamine their accounts. They were to be serious; to converse sparingly\r\nand cautiously with women; to take no step towards marriage without\r\nfirst acquainting Wesley or his brother clergymen; and to do nothing\r\nas a _gentleman_, for they had no more to do with this character than\r\nwith that of a dancing master. They were to be ashamed of nothing but\r\nsin; not of fetching wood, or drawing water; not of cleaning their own\r\nshoes, or their neighbour’s. They were to take no money of any one, and\r\nwere to contract no debts without Wesley’s knowledge; they were not to\r\nmend the rules, but keep them; to employ their time as Wesley directed,\r\nand to keep journals, as well for Wesley’s satisfaction as for profit\r\nto themselves.[532]\r\n\r\nIt was decided, that they should preach most, where those of them\r\nwho were clergymen could preach in a church; where they could get\r\nthe greatest number of quiet and willing hearers; and where they had\r\nmost success. It was agreed, that field preaching had been used too\r\nsparingly; that every alternate meeting of the society, in every place,\r\nshould be strictly private; and that at the other meeting strangers\r\nmight be admitted with caution, but not the same person above twice or\r\nthrice. To improve the usefulness of classleaders, it was resolved that\r\neach leader should be diligently examined, concerning his method of\r\nmeeting a class; that all of them should converse with the preachers,\r\nas frequently and as freely as possible; that they should attend the\r\nleaders’ meeting every week, bringing notes of all sick persons in\r\ntheir classes; and that none should speak in the leaders’ meeting\r\nbut the preacher or the steward, unless in answer to a question. The\r\nmembers were to be more closely examined, at the general visitation\r\nof the classes; the married men and married women, and the single\r\nmen and single women were to be met apart once a quarter; and all\r\nthe members were to be visited at their own houses, at times fixed\r\nfor such a purpose. Tickets were to be given to none, till they were\r\nrecommended by a leader with whom they had met three months on trial;\r\nand new members were to be admitted into the society only on the\r\nSunday following the quarterly visitation, their names being read on\r\nthe Sunday night previous. It was agreed, also that it was lawful for\r\nMethodists to bear arms; and that they might use the law as defendants,\r\nand perhaps in some cases as plaintiffs.[533]\r\n\r\nOther regulations were adopted, either at this or ensuing conferences,\r\nas follows: preachers were to meet the children in every place, and\r\ngive them suitable exhortations; they were to preach expressly and\r\nstrongly against sabbath breaking, dram drinking, evil speaking,\r\nunprofitable conversation, lightness, gaiety, or expensiveness of\r\napparel, and contracting debts without sufficient care to discharge\r\nthem; they were to recommend to every society, frequently and\r\nearnestly, the books that Wesley published, as preferable to any other;\r\nthey were to use their best endeavours to extirpate smuggling, and also\r\nbribery at elections; they were to speak to any that desired it, every\r\nday after the morning and evening preaching. As often as possible,\r\nthey were to rise at four o’clock; to spend two or three minutes\r\nevery hour in earnest prayer; to observe strictly the morning and\r\nevening hour of retirement; to rarely employ above an hour at a time\r\nin conversation; to use all the means of grace; to keep watchnights\r\nonce a month; to take a regular catalogue of the societies once a\r\nyear; to speak freely to each other, and never to part without prayer.\r\nThey were never to preach more than twice a day, unless on Sundays or\r\nextraordinary occasions; to begin and end the service precisely at the\r\ntime appointed; to always suit their subject to their congregations;\r\nto choose the plainest texts possible, and to beware of allegorizing\r\nand rambling from their texts. They were to avoid everything awkward or\r\naffected, either in phrase, gesture, or pronunciation; to sing no hymns\r\nof their own composing; to choose hymns proper for the congregation;\r\nnot to sing more than five or six verses at a time, and to suit the\r\ntune to the nature of the hymns. After preaching, they were recommended\r\nto take lemonade, candied orange peel, or a little soft, warm ale; and\r\nto avoid late suppers, and egg and wine, as downright poison.[534]\r\n\r\nHere we find six clergymen and four lay preachers, not elaborating\r\nan ecclesiastical structure, but carefully considering the greatest\r\ntruths of the Christian religion, and investigating the duties of its\r\npreachers. Six days were spent in this important work. They desired\r\nnothing, said Wesley, but to save their own souls and those that heard\r\nthem. Their doctrines, so simple and encouraging, were not the popular\r\ntheology of the age; but they were in the Scriptures, and what every\r\nsinner needed. They little thought, that they were constructing a\r\nplatform which would survive their times, and originating a long series\r\nof annual conferences which would become one of the most important\r\ninstitutions in the world; a central power, conveying religious\r\nbenefits to every quarter of the globe, and serving as a model for\r\nframing other similar institutions both at home and abroad. The\r\ndoctrines agreed upon are still the staple doctrines of the Methodist\r\ncommunities, and the elements of Methodist discipline may be found in\r\nthe minutes of this the first Methodist conference.\r\n\r\nLeaving Wesley’s first conference, we pass to his last sermon before\r\nthe university of Oxford.\r\n\r\nThe day appointed for the sermon was Friday, August 24, the anniversary\r\nof St. Bartholomew, and occurred in Oxford race week. The duty came to\r\nWesley by rotation; and had he declined it, he must have paid three\r\nguineas for a substitute. We have three accounts of this celebrated\r\nsermon. From Charles Wesley we learn, that he and Mr. Piers and Mr.\r\nMeriton were present at its delivery; that the audience was a large\r\none, and much increased by the racers; that the congregation gave the\r\nutmost attention; that some of the heads of colleges stood during the\r\nwhole service, and fixed their eyes upon the preacher; and that, after\r\nthe sermon, the little band of four Methodist clergymen walked away in\r\nform, none daring to join them.[535]\r\n\r\nWesley’s own account is as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “I preached, I suppose the last time, at St. Mary’s. Be it\r\n    so. I am now clear of the blood of these men. I have fully\r\n    delivered my own soul. The beadle came to me afterwards, and\r\n    told me the vice-chancellor had sent him for my notes. I sent\r\n    them without delay, not without admiring the wise providence of\r\n    God. Perhaps few men of note would have given a sermon of mine\r\n    the reading, if I had put it into their hands; but, by this\r\n    means, it came to be read, probably more than once, by every\r\n    man of eminence in the university.”[536]\r\n\r\n    “I am well pleased that the sermon was preached on the very\r\n    day on which, in the last century, near two thousand burning\r\n    and shining lights were put out at one stroke. Yet what a wide\r\n    difference is there between their case and mine! They were\r\n    turned out of house and home, and all that they had; whereas I\r\n    am only hindered from preaching, without any other loss; and\r\n    that in a kind of honourable manner; it being determined that,\r\n    when my next turn to preach came, they would pay another person\r\n    to preach for me; and so they did, twice or thrice, even to the\r\n    time that I resigned my fellowship.”[537]\r\n\r\nThe third account is by the celebrated Dr. Kennicott, who was, at this\r\nperiod, in the twenty-fifth year of his age, and an undergraduate of\r\nWadham College. He had no sympathy with the Methodists, and yet he\r\nappears to have been deeply impressed with Wesley’s sermon. He writes:—\r\n\r\n    “All that are masters of arts, and on the foundation of any\r\n    college, are set down in a roll, as they take their degree;\r\n    and, in that order, preach before the university, or pay three\r\n    guineas for a preacher in their stead; and as no clergyman can\r\n    avoid his turn, so the university can refuse none; otherwise\r\n    Mr. Wesley would not have preached. He came to Oxford some\r\n    time before, and preached frequently every day in courts,\r\n    public houses, and elsewhere. On Friday morning, having held\r\n    forth twice in private, at five and at eight, he came to St.\r\n    Mary’s at ten o’clock. There were present the vice-chancellor,\r\n    the proctors, most of the heads of houses, a vast number of\r\n    gownsmen, and a multitude of private people, with many of\r\n    Wesley’s own people, both brethren and sisters. He is neither\r\n    tall nor fat; for the latter would ill become a Methodist. His\r\n    black hair, quite smooth, and parted very exactly, added to\r\n    a peculiar composure in his countenance, showed him to be an\r\n    uncommon man. His prayer was soft, short, and conformable to\r\n    the rules of the university. His text was Acts iv. 31. He spoke\r\n    it very slowly, and with an agreeable emphasis.” [Here follows\r\n    a description of the sermon.] “When he came to what he called\r\n    his plain, practical conclusion, he fired his address with so\r\n    much zeal and unbounded satire as quite spoiled what otherwise\r\n    might have been turned to great advantage; for, as I liked\r\n    some, so I disliked other parts of his discourse extremely. I\r\n    liked some of his freedom, such as calling the generality of\r\n    young gownsmen ‘a generation of triflers,’ and many other just\r\n    invectives. But, considering how many shining lights are here,\r\n    that are the glory of the Christian cause, his sacred censure\r\n    was much too flaming and strong, and his charity much too weak\r\n    in not making large allowances. But, so far from allowances,\r\n    he concluded, with a lifted up eye, in this most solemn form,\r\n    ‘It is time for Thee, Lord, to lay to Thine hand;’ words full\r\n    of such presumption and seeming imprecation, that they gave\r\n    an universal shock. This, and the assertion that Oxford was\r\n    not a Christian city, and this country not a Christian nation,\r\n    were the most offensive parts of the sermon, except when he\r\n    accused the whole body (and confessed himself to be one of the\r\n    number) of the sin of perjury; and for this reason, because,\r\n    upon becoming members of a college, every person takes an oath\r\n    to observe the statutes of the university, and no one observes\r\n    them in all things. Had these things been omitted, and his\r\n    censures moderated, I think his discourse, as to style, and\r\n    delivery, would have been uncommonly pleasing to others as well\r\n    as to myself. He is allowed to be a man of great parts, and\r\n    that by the excellent Dean of Christ Church (Dr. Conybeare);\r\n    for the day he preached, the dean generously said of him, ‘John\r\n    Wesley will always be thought a man of sound sense, though\r\n    an enthusiast.’ However, the vice-chancellor sent for the\r\n    sermon, and I hear the heads of colleges intend to show their\r\n    resentment.”[538]\r\n\r\nThis obnoxious sermon was published a few weeks after it was preached,\r\nand was advertised in the October magazines, price sixpence.[539]\r\nAnother edition was issued in the same year, at Newcastle on Tyne,\r\n12mo, eighteen pages.\r\n\r\nIn a preface to the reader, Wesley says, that he never intended to\r\nprint the latter part of the sermon; but “the false and scurrilous\r\naccounts of it which had been published, almost in every corner of\r\nthe nation, now constrained him to publish the whole, just as it was\r\npreached, that men of reason might judge for themselves.”\r\n\r\nThe sermon has three divisions, and considers Christianity under three\r\ndistinct aspects—(1) As beginning to exist in individuals. (2) As\r\nspreading from one to another. (3) As covering the earth. Of these\r\nnothing need be said. That which gave offence was the “plain, practical\r\napplication,” which is quite one third of the entire discourse. The\r\nfollowing extracts will show what it was that gave the offence which\r\nOxford authorities never pardoned; and also the fidelity and Christian\r\ncourage of the preacher in uttering such sentiments before such a\r\ncongregation.\r\n\r\n    “I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies of God, if ye do\r\n    account _me_ a madman or a fool, yet _as a fool bear with me_.\r\n    It is utterly needful, that some one should use great plainness\r\n    of speech towards you. It is more especially needful at _this_\r\n    time; for who knoweth but it is the _last_? And who will use\r\n    this plainness, if I do not? Therefore I, even I, will speak.\r\n    And I adjure you, by the living God, that ye steel not your\r\n    hearts against receiving a blessing at _my_ hands.\r\n\r\n    “Let me ask you then, in tender love, and in the spirit of\r\n    meekness, Is this city a _Christian_ city? Is _Christianity,\r\n    scriptural Christianity_, found here? Are we, considered as a\r\n    community of men, so filled with the Holy Ghost as to enjoy in\r\n    our hearts, and show forth in our lives, the genuine fruits of\r\n    that Spirit? Are all the magistrates, all heads and governors\r\n    of colleges and halls, and their respective societies, (not to\r\n    speak of the inhabitants of the town,) of one heart and soul?\r\n    Is the love of God shed abroad in our hearts? Are our tempers\r\n    the same that were in Christ? And are our lives agreeable\r\n    thereto?\r\n\r\n    “In the fear, and in the presence of the great God, before\r\n    whom both you and I shall shortly appear, I pray you that are\r\n    in authority over us, whom I reverence for your office sake,\r\n    to consider, Are you filled with the Holy Ghost? Are ye lively\r\n    portraitures of Him whom ye are appointed to represent among\r\n    men? Ye magistrates and rulers, are all the thoughts of your\r\n    hearts, all your tempers and desires, suitable to your high\r\n    calling? Are all your words like unto those which come out of\r\n    the mouth of God? Is there in all your actions dignity and love?\r\n\r\n    “Ye venerable men, who are more especially called to form the\r\n    tender minds of youth, are you filled with the Holy Ghost? with\r\n    all those fruits of the Spirit, which your important office so\r\n    indispensably requires? Do you continually remind those under\r\n    your care, that the one rational end of all our studies is\r\n    to know, love, and serve the only true God, and Jesus Christ\r\n    whom He hath sent? Do you inculcate upon them, day by day,\r\n    that without love all learning is but splendid ignorance,\r\n    pompous folly, vexation of spirit? Has all you teach an actual\r\n    tendency to the love of God, and of all mankind for His sake?\r\n    Do you put forth all your strength in the vast work you have\r\n    undertaken—using every talent which God hath lent you, and that\r\n    to the uttermost of your power?\r\n\r\n    “What example is set them” [the youth] “by us who enjoy\r\n    the beneficence of our forefathers,—by fellows, students,\r\n    scholars,—more especially those who are of some rank and\r\n    eminence? Do ye, brethren, abound in the fruits of the\r\n    Spirit,—in lowliness of mind, in self denial and mortification,\r\n    in seriousness and composure of spirit, in patience, meekness,\r\n    sobriety, temperance, and in unwearied, restless endeavours\r\n    to do good, in every kind, unto all men? Is this the general\r\n    character of fellows of colleges? I fear it is not. Rather,\r\n    have not pride and haughtiness of spirit, impatience and\r\n    peevishness, sloth and indolence, gluttony and sensuality, and\r\n    even a proverbial uselessness, been objected to us, _perhaps_\r\n    not always by our enemies, nor _wholly_ without ground?\r\n\r\n    “Many of us are more immediately consecrated to God, called\r\n    to minister in holy things. Are we then patterns to the rest,\r\n    in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in\r\n    purity? From what motives did we enter upon this office? Was it\r\n    with a single eye to serve God? Have we clearly determined to\r\n    give ourselves wholly to it? Do we forsake and set aside, as\r\n    much as in us lies, all worldly cares and studies? Are we apt\r\n    to teach? Are we taught of God, that we may be able to teach\r\n    others also? What are the seals of our apostleship? Who, that\r\n    were dead in trespasses and sins, have been quickened by our\r\n    word? Have we a burning zeal to save souls from death; so that,\r\n    for their sake, we often forget even to eat our bread?\r\n\r\n    “Once more, What shall we say concerning the youth of this\r\n    place? Have _you_ either the form or the power of _Christian_\r\n    godliness? Are you humble, teachable, advisable? or stubborn,\r\n    self willed, heady, and high-minded? Are you obedient to your\r\n    superiors as to parents? Or do you despise those to whom you\r\n    owe the tenderest reverence? Are you diligent in pursuing your\r\n    studies with all your strength, crowding as much work into\r\n    every day as it can contain? Rather, do you not waste day after\r\n    day, either in reading what has no tendency to Christianity, or\r\n    in gaming, or in—you know not what? Do you, out of principle,\r\n    take care to owe no man anything? Do you remember the sabbath\r\n    day to keep it holy? Do you know how to possess your bodies\r\n    in sanctification and in honour? Are not drunkenness and\r\n    uncleanness found among you? Yea, are there not of you, who\r\n    glory in their shame? Do not many of you take the name of God\r\n    in vain, perhaps habitually, without either remorse or fear?\r\n    Yea, are there not a multitude of you that are forsworn? Be\r\n    not surprised, brethren; before God and this congregation, I\r\n    own myself to have been of that number; solemnly swearing to\r\n    _observe all those customs_, which I then knew nothing of; and\r\n    _those statutes_, which I did not so much as read over, either\r\n    then or for some years after. What is perjury, if this is not?\r\n\r\n    “May it not be one of the consequences of this, that so many\r\n    of you are a generation of triflers? triflers with God, with\r\n    one another, and with your own souls? How few of you spend,\r\n    from one week to another, a single hour in private prayer?\r\n    How few have any thought of God in the general tenour of your\r\n    conversation? Can you bear, unless now and then, in a church,\r\n    any talk of the Holy Ghost? Would you not take it for granted,\r\n    if one began such a conversation, that it was either hypocrisy\r\n    or enthusiasm? In the name of the Lord God almighty, I ask,\r\n    What religion are you of? Even the talk of _Christianity_ ye\r\n    cannot, will not bear. O my brethren! What a Christian city is\r\n    this? It is time for Thee, Lord, to lay to Thine hand.\r\n\r\n    “For indeed, what probability, what possibility is there,\r\n    that Christianity, scriptural Christianity, should be again\r\n    the religion of this place? that all orders of men among us\r\n    should speak and live as men filled with the Holy Ghost? By\r\n    whom should this Christianity be restored? By those of you\r\n    that are in authority? Are you desirous it should be restored?\r\n    And do ye not count your fortune, liberty, life, dear unto\r\n    yourselves, so ye may be instrumental in restoring it? But\r\n    suppose ye have this desire, who hath any power proportioned\r\n    to the effect? Perhaps some of you have made a few faint\r\n    attempts, but with how small success? Shall Christianity then\r\n    be restored by young, unknown, inconsiderable men? I know not\r\n    whether ye yourselves would suffer it. Would not some of you\r\n    cry out, ‘Young man, in so doing thou reproachest us’? But\r\n    there is no danger of your being put to the proof; so hath\r\n    iniquity overspread us like a flood. Whom then shall God send?\r\n    The famine, the pestilence, or the sword, the last messengers\r\n    of God to a guilty land? The armies of the Romish aliens, to\r\n    reform us into our first love? Nay, rather, let us fall into\r\n    Thy hand, O Lord, and let us not fall into the hand of man!”\r\n\r\nThis is not only the substance, but nearly the whole of the “plain,\r\npractical application,” that created so much offence. Who can find\r\nfault with it? Rather, who will not commend the bold preacher,\r\nwho, in such yearning accents, gave utterance to truths of the\r\nhighest consequence, but which perhaps no one but himself, in such a\r\ncongregation, durst have uttered? Would to God that pulpits had more\r\nof this courageous, pitying fidelity, at the present day! Is it not a\r\nfact, that preaching now-a-days consists so much of polite and pious\r\nplatitudes, that, so far from saving souls, it is almost powerless? The\r\nage is too refined to tolerate preachers of the stamp of Luther, Knox,\r\nand Wesley. The words of the prophets are, in this pretentiously polite\r\nperiod of the church’s history, well worth pondering: “They have healed\r\nthe hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace;\r\nwhen there is no peace.” “This is a rebellious people, lying children,\r\nchildren that will not hear the law of the Lord; which say to the\r\nseers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things;\r\nspeak unto us smooth things; prophesy deceits.”\r\n\r\nIt was Wesley’s fidelity, far more than the novelty of his doctrines\r\nand proceedings, that brought upon him the persecutions he encountered.\r\nOf these, he and the Methodists had already had their share; but the\r\nvials of the people’s wrath were far from being emptied. The outrages\r\nin Staffordshire and other places have been already mentioned. “In\r\nCornwall,” says Wesley, “the war against the Methodists was carried\r\non with far more vigour than that against the Spaniards.” “At St.\r\nIves,” writes Henry Millard, “the word of God runs and is glorified;\r\nbut the devil rages horribly.” At Camborne, Thomas Westall was pulled\r\ndown while preaching in Mr. Harris’s house; was carried to Penzance,\r\nwhere Dr. Borlase wrote a “mittimus” committing him to the house of\r\ncorrection at Bodmin as a vagrant; and here he was kept till the next\r\nquarter sessions, when the justices, then assembled, knowing a little\r\nmore of the laws of God and man than Dr. Borlase and his Penzance\r\n_confrères_, declared his commitment to be illegal, and set him at\r\nliberty. “For what pay,” asks Wesley, justly proud of his preachers,\r\n“could we procure men to do this service,—to be always ready to go\r\nto prison or to death?” Dr. Borlase was a man of unquestioned sense\r\nand learning; but he was a bigot of the purest water. On his asking\r\nJonathan Reeves to point him out a man who had been the better for\r\nhearing the Methodists, Jonathan pointed to John Daniel, then before\r\nhim. “Get along,” cried the doctor. “Get along; you are a parcel of\r\nmad, crazy headed fellows;” and taking them by the shoulders, he thrust\r\nthem to the doors. After this, we find him issuing warrants for the\r\napprehension of Methodists; sending Thomas Maxfield to be a soldier;\r\nand signing a warrant for the arrest of Wesley himself; yet all this\r\nwas not sufficient to prevent Wesley rendering to the Cornish bigot his\r\ndue share of literary praise. “I looked over,” writes Wesley, in 1757,\r\n“Dr. Borlase’s Antiquities of Cornwall. He is a fine writer, and quite\r\nmaster of his subject. He has distinguished, with amazing accuracy, the\r\nancient Saxon monuments from the more ancient Roman, and from those of\r\nthe Druids, the most ancient of all.”[540] The doctor died in 1772.\r\n\r\nDr. Borlase was not alone; for his brother clergymen raged against\r\nthe Methodists without measure, and, in their sermons, retailed the\r\ngrossest lies concerning them. A poor woman complained to the mayor of\r\nSt. Ives of some one throwing a huge stone into her house, which fell\r\non a pillow within a few inches of her suckling child. His worship\r\ndamned her, and said she might go about her business. One of the clergy\r\ntold Jonathan Reeves, he wished the Bible were in Latin only, so that\r\nnone of the common people could read it.[541] The mob at St. Ives\r\nsaluted Wesley with stones and dirt; and pulled down the meeting-house,\r\n“for joy that Admiral Matthews had beat the Spaniards.” It was a\r\ngratifying fact, however, that, notwithstanding the fierceness of the\r\nCornish persecution, not more than three or four of the Methodists\r\nturned cowardly deserters, while the rest, instead of being shaken,\r\nwere confirmed in their principles by the violence of their enemies.\r\n\r\nThe press was still vigorously employed. An anonymous pamphlet,\r\nentitled “Observations upon the Conduct and Behaviour of a certain\r\nSect usually designated by the name of Methodists,” 4to, pages 24, was\r\nwritten by Dr. Gibson, and obtained considerable approval from his\r\nbrother bishops.[542] In this prelatical publication, the Methodists\r\nare charged with setting government at defiance, by appointing public\r\nplaces of religious worship, and by preaching in the open air, without\r\ntaking the prescribed oaths, and subscribing the declaration against\r\nPopery. They broke the rules of the church of which they professed\r\nthemselves members, by going to other than their own parish churches to\r\nreceive the sacrament. Their doctrines and practices were a dis-service\r\nto religion—1. Because they set the standard of religion so high,\r\nthat some were led to disregard religion altogether. 2. Because they\r\ncarried the doctrine of justification by faith alone to such a height,\r\nas not to allow that the observance of moral duties is a condition of\r\nbeing justified. 3. Because a due attendance on the public offices of\r\nreligion answered the purposes of devotion better than the “sudden\r\nagonies, roarings, screamings, tremblings, ravings, and madness of\r\nthe Methodists.” 4. Because their exalted strains of religion led to\r\nspiritual pride, and to contempt of their superiors. In short, the\r\nirregular practices of the Methodists were of the like nature as those\r\nwhich had so great a share in bringing in the religious confusions of\r\nthe last century.\r\n\r\nWhitefield replied to this pamphlet in two small quarto tracts, of\r\nfourteen and twenty-four pages respectively. This evoked “A Serious\r\nand Expostulatory Letter,” by the Rev. Thomas Church, M.A., vicar of\r\nBattersea, and prebendary of St. Paul’s;[543] and also another letter,\r\nof fifty pages, “by a Gentleman of Pembroke College, Oxford.” In the\r\nlatter production, the Methodists are censured for “suffering their\r\nheated imaginations to mount to such an exalted pitch, that it hurries\r\nthem out of their senses, evaporates the religious spirit, and leaves\r\nnothing but sensuality in the heated machine.” Whitefield’s answer\r\nto “Observations on the Conduct and Behaviour of the Methodists” is\r\npolitely said to be “stuffed with the coaxing and wheedling of the\r\n_woman_, the daring of the _rebel_, the pertness of the _coxcomb_,\r\nthe evasions of the _jesuit_, and the bitterness of the _bigot_.”\r\nIt is unblushingly affirmed, that the Methodists “can curse, rail,\r\nand _berogue_ their antagonists, though in Scripture language, so\r\nas hardly to be exceeded by any pope, or _spiritual bully_, that\r\never yet appeared in Christendom.” They are a “rag-tag mob,” using\r\n“lascivious and blasphemously languishing expressions when they talk\r\nof the Redeemer’s love.” “They cant and blaspheme the Holy Spirit, and\r\nappeal to starts and sallies of flesh and blood for the inspiration of\r\nthe Holy One.” They are “a set of creatures of the lowest rank, most\r\nof them illiterate, and of desperate fortunes; cursing, reviling, and\r\nshowing their teeth at every one that does not approve of their frenzy\r\nand extravagance.” Whitefield was “crafty and malicious enough to be\r\nsuspected of any wicked enterprise,—a person of wicked principles,\r\ntravelling over all counties, to establish newfangled societies”; and\r\nhe and his friends were “heads and spiritual directors of hot-brained\r\ncobblers, all big with venom against the clergy of the Established\r\nChurch.” The author “trembles and shudders,” lest the Methodists should\r\nbe “betrayed, by their feelings and stretchings, into a bed of eternal\r\nfire and brimstone, appointed for the reception of the lewd, the\r\nconcupiscent, and the blasphemous.”\r\n\r\nThese are fair specimens of the foul foamings of this valiant defender\r\nof Church and state.\r\n\r\nAnother pamphlet, published in 1744, was “A Charge against Enthusiasm,”\r\ndelivered, in several parts of his diocese, by the Bishop of Lichfield;\r\nand the object of which was to prove that “the indwelling and inward\r\nwitnessing of the Spirit in believers’ hearts, as also praying and\r\npreaching by the Spirit, are all the _extraordinary gifts_ and\r\noperations of the Holy Ghost, belonging only to the apostolical and\r\nprimitive times, and that, consequently, all pretensions to such\r\nfavours in these last days are vain and enthusiastical.”\r\n\r\nAnother, published at a shilling, was “Remarks on Mr. J. Wesley’s last\r\nJournal, by Thomas Church, A.M.,”[544] the prebendary of St. Paul’s\r\nalready mentioned. Mr. Church sums up his charges against Wesley thus:\r\n“It is impossible for you to put an entire stop to the enormities of\r\nthe Moravians, while you still (1) too much commend these men; (2) hold\r\nprinciples in common with them, from which these enormities naturally\r\nfollow; and, (3) maintain other errors more than theirs, and are\r\nguilty of enthusiasm to the highest degree.” Mr. Church’s “Remarks,”\r\nhowever, will have to be noticed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all this foam and fury against the Methodists, must\r\nbe mentioned an equally vile attack of another kind. At the Brecon\r\nassizes, held in the month of August, the grand jury deemed it their\r\nduty to make a presentment to the presiding judge to the following\r\neffect: “that the Methodists held illegal meetings,” and that\r\ntheir “preachers pretended to expound the Scriptures by virtue of\r\ninspiration”; that, by this means, “they collected together great\r\nnumbers of disorderly persons, very much endangering the peace of\r\nour sovereign lord the king; and that, unless their proceedings were\r\ntimely suppressed, they might endanger the peace of the kingdom in\r\ngeneral.” At all events, “the pretended preachers, or teachers, at\r\ntheir irregular meetings, by their enthusiastic doctrines, very much\r\nconfounded and disordered the minds of his majesty’s good subjects”;\r\nand this, “in time, might lead to the overthrowing of our good\r\ngovernment, both in Church and state.” Finally, the judge is requested,\r\nif the authority of the present court was not sufficient for the\r\npurpose, to apply to some superior authority, in order to put an end to\r\nthe “villainous scheme” of “such dangerous assemblies.”[545]\r\n\r\nThus had Methodism to make its way through the opposition of vulgar\r\nmobs, fiery priests, lampooning pamphleteers, unjust magistrates, and\r\ngrand juries. Gamaliel’s advice was set aside: “Refrain from these men,\r\nand let them alone; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will\r\ncome to nought: but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply\r\nye be found even to fight against God.”\r\n\r\nWesley’s longest journey, in 1744, was from London to Cornwall, thence\r\nto Newcastle, and thence to London. Nearly three months were spent\r\nupon this evangelistic tour: many hundreds of miles were traversed,\r\nnot by rail, or even in stage coaches, but on horseback, over the most\r\nmiserable roads, the rider sometimes battered with rain and hail for\r\nhours together, and at others plunging through drifts of snow enough\r\nto engulf both man and beast. About a hundred sermons were preached:\r\nsome, at Gwennap and at St. Stithian, to thousands upon thousands of\r\nattentive hearers; some in public houses; some on village greens; and a\r\nfew in parish churches.\r\n\r\nOne of the churches Wesley was permitted to occupy was at Laneast, in\r\nCornwall, of which Mr. Bennett was the aged clergyman. Another was at\r\nLandau, in Wales. “Such a church,” says Wesley, “I never saw before.\r\nThere was not a glass window belonging to it; but only boards, with\r\nholes bored here and there, through which a dim light glimmered. Yet\r\neven here the light of God’s countenance has shone on many hearts.” In\r\nthe former of these churches a strange scene was witnessed in the month\r\nof August. Charles Wesley was preaching “against harmless diversions,”\r\nhaving three clergymen, Messrs. Meriton, Thompson, and Bennett, among\r\nhis auditors. “By harmless diversions,” exclaimed the preacher, “I\r\nwas kept asleep in the devils arms, secure in a state of damnation,\r\nfor eighteen years.” No sooner were the words uttered than Meriton\r\nadded aloud, “And I for twenty-five!” “And I,” cried Thompson, “for\r\nthirty-five!” “And I,” said Bennett, the venerable minister of the\r\nchurch, “and I for above seventy.”\r\n\r\nStrange and stirring incidents came across Wesley’s path. In his\r\nfather’s church, at Epworth, he heard Mr. Romley preach two of the\r\nbitterest and falsest sermons he ever listened to. On proceeding to\r\nSyke House, some of his friends met him and said a drunken mob was\r\nawaiting his arrival, who would press all the men in the congregation\r\nfor soldiers. Others declared, the mob was just about to fire the\r\nmeeting-house, or pull it to the ground. Wesley calmly answered,\r\n“Our only way is to make the best use of it while standing;” and,\r\naccordingly, he entered it at once, and expounded the tenth chapter\r\nof Matthew. At Durham, he met John Nelson and Thomas Beard, at that\r\ntime with their regiment, and took them to his inn, and said, “Brother\r\nNelson, lose no time; speak and spare not, for God has work for you to\r\ndo in every place where your lot is cast; and when you have fulfilled\r\nHis good pleasure, He will burst your bonds asunder, and we shall\r\nrejoice together.”[546] At Chinley, in Derbyshire, lived a poor widow,\r\nof the name of Godhard, with a family of four small children. At her\r\nrequest, Wesley made Chinley a resting place, and preached. Finding the\r\nwidow’s house too small, he stood upon a chair near to a miller’s dam.\r\nThe miller, enraged at Wesley and his congregation daring to worship\r\nin such proximity to his premises, let off the water for the purpose\r\nof drowning Wesley’s voice. The effort was a failure; truth triumphed;\r\nChinley became a Methodist preaching place; and, in order to provide\r\nthe preachers when they called with a cup of tea, the poor widow and\r\nher children set apart the whole of every Friday night for winding\r\nbobbins, depositing the earnings, as a sacred treasure, in an old pint\r\nmug, and never touching them except to meet the necessities of Wesley’s\r\nitinerants when paying their gospel visits.[547]\r\n\r\nAlready Wesley’s lay preachers had become a considerable host. In\r\ndifferent parts of the kingdom there were, at least, forty of these\r\ndevoted evangelists.[548] Some of them, as John Brown, of Newcastle,\r\nDavid Taylor, John Downes, John Nelson, William Shepherd, John\r\nSlocomb, Thomas Westall, Thomas Beard, John Haime, Thomas Richards,\r\nJohn Bennet, and Thomas Maxfield, have been already mentioned. Besides\r\nthese, there were—John Haughton, originally a weaver, who, whilst\r\nthe mob, in the city of Cork, were burning Wesley in effigy, threw\r\nup the window and began to preach to the people in the street; and\r\nwho, afterwards, obtained episcopal ordination and settled in the\r\nsister country;—Jonathan Reeves, who was with Wesley when he laid the\r\nfirst stone of the Orphan House at Newcastle, and who, after passing\r\nthrough a great amount of persecution, became an ordained minister\r\nof the Church of England, preached in London, and died in 1778,\r\ntestifying that all his hope was in Christ Jesus;—Enoch Williams,\r\npious, deeply devoted to his work, faithful and successful, and brought\r\nto an untimely grave in 1744;—Thomas Williams, extremely popular as\r\na preacher; but haughty, revengeful, headstrong, and unmanageable; a\r\ngreat favourite among the London young ladies; but a maligner of the\r\ntwo Wesleys; expelled in 1744, but taken back on declaring, before\r\nmany witnesses, that the slanders he had propagated against Wesley\r\nand his brother were grossly false; the man who introduced Methodism\r\ninto Ireland in 1747, but who was again expelled from the Methodist\r\nsociety in 1755; and then, through the Countess of Huntingdon, obtained\r\nepiscopal ordination, and for several years acted as a clergyman in the\r\nneighbourhood of High Wycombe;—Thomas Meyrick, a native of Cornwall,\r\neducated for the law, a poet, but expelled from the Methodist connexion\r\nin 1750, after which he became a clergyman of the Established Church,\r\nand died, we fear, a drunkard, at Halifax, in 1770;—John Trembath,\r\none of Wesley’s most courageous preachers, though somewhat vain and\r\nstubborn; then a farmer and a fibber; and, for a long series of years,\r\nan impoverished vagabond, who died about 1794;—Alexander Coates, a\r\npoor Scotch “laddie,” fond of books, who could speak in Gaelic, read\r\nwith fluency in Dutch and Danish, and had some acquaintance with\r\nHebrew, Greek, and Latin; the honoured instrument in the conversion\r\nof Mr. Crosse, the well known Bradford vicar; one of the best of\r\nmen, and a most useful preacher, who died, at Newcastle, in 1765,\r\nin perfect peace;—William Darney, another Scotchman, honest, bold,\r\nimpetuous, a rhymer, and painfully eccentric, but who was used by\r\nProvidence in converting Grimshaw, and who prided himself upon never\r\n“_dabbing_ people with untempered mortar”;—Nicholas Gilbert, a man\r\nof deep piety, and of great simplicity, possessed of considerable\r\ntalents, and pronounced by Wesley “an excellent preacher”;—Samuel\r\nLarwood, who in 1754 became a Dissenting minister in the borough of\r\nSouthwark;—James Jones, one of the first fruits of Wesley’s ministry in\r\nStaffordshire, as bold as a lion, and who built, at his own expense,\r\nthe first Methodist chapel at Tipton Green;—Joseph Jones, who left\r\nthe itinerancy in 1760, became a farmer in the county of Somerset,\r\nand acted as a local preacher to the end of life;—Herbert Jenkins,\r\nwho afterwards became one of Whitefield’s preachers, and laboured in\r\nthe Tabernacle connexion;—John Maddern, a man of genuine piety, and a\r\nlively, zealous preacher;—Henry Millard, who, after narrowly escaping\r\na violent death at the hands of a Cornish mob, fell a victim to an\r\nattack of small pox, in 1746;—William Prior, of whom Charles Wesley, in\r\na manuscript letter now before us, dated 1755, writes: “William Prior\r\nis ordained, without learning, interest, or aught but Providence to\r\nrecommend him”;—Robert Swindells, a man of great benevolence, who was\r\nnever heard to speak an unkind word of any one, had no enemy, and died\r\nfull of days, riches, and honour in 1783;—James Wheatley, of Norwich\r\nnotoriety, where he was often dragged by the hair of his head through\r\nthe streets of the city, built a large chapel, and became immensely\r\npopular, but who ultimately died, beneath a cloud, in Bristol;—Francis\r\nWalker, a native of Tewkesbury, pious, honest, and upright, his talents\r\nsmall, but his preaching lively, zealous, and useful, an instrument\r\nof great good to souls wherever he went, and who settled in the city\r\nof Gloucester, where he died in peace. And to all these must be added\r\nWilliam Biggs, Thomas Crouch, John Hall, Thomas Hardwick, Francis\r\nScott, David Tratham, Thomas Willes, and William Holmes.\r\n\r\nLittle more remains to be related concerning the year 1744. The\r\nNewcastle society was increasingly earnest, there hardly being a\r\ntrifler left. The society at Bristol was not so perfect as it should\r\nhave been, many of the members crying out, “Faith, faith! Believe,\r\nbelieve!” but making little account of the fruits of faith, either of\r\nholiness or good works. The London society was poor, but generous. At\r\na single collection, in the month of February, they contributed nearly\r\nfifty pounds to relieve the destitute around them, and which Wesley at\r\nonce laid out in buying clothes for those whom he knew to be diligent\r\nand yet in want. A month later, they made a second collection of\r\nabout thirty pounds. A month later still, a third collection of about\r\nsix-and-twenty pounds; and to these three collections were added ninety\r\npounds more in the shape of private subscriptions; making altogether\r\n£196 raised by the poor London Methodists, and employed in providing\r\nclothing for three hundred and sixty persons.\r\n\r\nAlready some of Wesley’s people began to profess Christian perfection;\r\nbut he was extremely cautious in receiving their testimony. At the end\r\nof the year, he writes:—\r\n\r\n    “I was with two persons who believe they are saved from all\r\n    sin. Be it so, or not, why should we not rejoice in the work\r\n    of God, so far as it is unquestionably wrought in them? For\r\n    instance, I ask John C——, ‘Do you always pray? Do you rejoice\r\n    in God every moment? Do you in everything give thanks? In loss?\r\n    In pain? In sickness, weariness, disappointments? Do you desire\r\n    nothing? Do you fear nothing? Do you feel the love of God\r\n    continually in your heart? Have you a witness in whatever you\r\n    speak or do, that it is pleasing to God?’ If he can solemnly\r\n    and deliberately answer in the affirmative, why do I not\r\n    rejoice and praise God on his behalf? Perhaps, because I have\r\n    an exceeding complex idea of sanctification, or a sanctified\r\n    man. And so, for fear he should not have attained all I include\r\n    in that idea, I cannot rejoice in what he has attained.”\r\n\r\nThis is significant language. Wesley preached the doctrine; but he was\r\nslow to believe those who professed to experience it; and it is a fact\r\nmore remarkable, that, so far as there is evidence to show, Wesley\r\nnever, to the day of his death, professed as much as this himself.\r\nHundreds, if not thousands, of his followers did; perhaps he himself\r\nwas restrained from doing so, by a dislike to high profession, or by a\r\nconscientious fear, that he hardly reached the standard above set up.\r\n\r\nThe thing occasioned him great anxiety. A short time before his death,\r\nhe wrote as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Four or five and forty years ago, I had no distinct views of\r\n    what the apostle meant by exhorting us to ‘leave the principles\r\n    of the doctrine of Christ, and go on to perfection;’ but two\r\n    or three persons in London, whom I knew to be truly sincere,\r\n    desired to give me an account of their experience. It appeared\r\n    exceeding strange, being different from any that I had heard\r\n    before. The next year, two or three more persons at Bristol,\r\n    and two or three at Kingswood, coming to me severally, gave\r\n    me exactly the same account of their experience. A few years\r\n    after, I desired all those in London who made the same\r\n    profession, to come to me all together at the Foundery, that\r\n    I might be thoroughly satisfied. I desired that man of God,\r\n    Thomas Walsh, to give us the meeting there. When we met, first\r\n    one of us, and then another, asked them the most searching\r\n    questions we could devise. They answered every one without\r\n    hesitation, and with the utmost simplicity, so that we were\r\n    fully persuaded, they did not deceive themselves. In the years\r\n    1759 to 1762 their numbers multiplied exceedingly, not only in\r\n    London and Bristol, but in various parts of Ireland as well as\r\n    England. Not trusting to the testimony of others, I carefully\r\n    examined most of these myself; and, in London alone, I found\r\n    652 members of our society who were exceeding clear in their\r\n    experience, and of whose testimony I could see no reason to\r\n    doubt. I believe no year has passed since that time, wherein\r\n    God has not wrought the same work in many others; and every one\r\n    of these (without a single exception) has declared, that his\r\n    deliverance from sin was _instantaneous_; that the change was\r\n    wrought in a moment. Had half of these, or one third, or one\r\n    in twenty, declared it was _gradually_ wrought in _them_, I\r\n    should have believed this, with regard to _them_, and thought\r\n    that _some_ were gradually sanctified and some instantaneously.\r\n    But as I have not found, in so long a space of time, a single\r\n    person speaking thus, I cannot but believe, that sanctification\r\n    is commonly, if not always, an _instantaneous_ work.”[549]\r\n\r\nThis is a subject of vast importance, and will often recur in future\r\npages. Meanwhile, all will give Wesley credit for the utmost sincerity,\r\nthough some may doubt whether human experience is, in itself,\r\nsufficient to settle and decide Christian doctrine.\r\n\r\nWesley’s pen was, if possible, more busily employed than ever; not so\r\nmuch in composing original productions, as in abridging and revising\r\nthe works of others. During the year 1744, he published the following:—\r\n\r\n1. The sermon preached before the Oxford university on August 24.\r\n\r\n2. An Extract from his Journal, from November 1, 1739, to September\r\n3, 1741. With prefatory Letter to the Moravian Church, dated June 24,\r\n1744; and two hymns annexed, on “The Means of Grace,” and “The Bloody\r\nIssue,” both having reference to the Moravian controversy.\r\n\r\n3. The Rules of the Band Societies. These, as we have already seen,\r\nwere read at the conference held in June. During the year, they were\r\npublished in the form following:—“The Nature, Design, and General Rules\r\nof the United Societies, in London, Bristol, Kingswood, and Newcastle\r\nupon Tyne. The fourth edition. To which are subjoined the Rules of\r\nthe Band Societies. London: printed by William Strahan. 1744.” 12mo,\r\ntwelve pages. The _Rules_ of the band societies were the same as those\r\nwhich Wesley had drawn up for the Moravian bands, in 1738. The band\r\nsociety members were composed, as previously stated, of persons who\r\nprofessed to have obtained the forgiveness of sins. They were middle\r\nclass Methodists; that is, in a more advanced state than the members of\r\nthe “United Societies,” but not so advanced as the “Select Societies.”\r\nThe questions to be proposed to every one before he was admitted were\r\nto the following effect:—1. Have you forgiveness of sins? 2. Peace with\r\nGod? 3. The witness of the Spirit? 4. Is the love of God shed abroad\r\nin your heart? 5. Has no sin dominion over you? 6. Do you desire to be\r\ntold of your faults? 7. Do you desire we should tell you whatsoever we\r\nthink, fear, or hear concerning you? 8. Is it your desire and design,\r\non this and all other occasions, to speak everything that is in your\r\nheart, without exception, without disguise, and without reserve?\r\n\r\nThe propriety of such questions will be doubted, and especially of\r\nother five which had to be proposed at every meeting, and which have\r\nbeen given in a previous chapter. (See page 210.) It would have been\r\nno loss to Methodism or to the religious world, if these queries,\r\nfirst drawn up by Wesley on Christmas day, 1738, had been allowed to\r\nslumber in the shades of Moravian oblivion. At present, they are never\r\nused; and though, in the first instance, they might be adapted to the\r\nMoravian brotherhood, they are far too inquisitorial for Methodists.\r\n\r\nThe bands had to meet once a week; and were bound to observe the\r\nfollowing “Directions”:—\r\n\r\nI. To abstain from evil, especially buying or selling on the sabbath;\r\ntasting spirituous liquors; pawning; backbiting; wearing needless\r\nornaments, as rings, earrings, necklaces, lace, and ruffles; and taking\r\nsnuff or tobacco.\r\n\r\nII. To maintain good works,—especially almsgiving; reproving sin;\r\ntogether with diligence, frugality, and self denial.\r\n\r\nIII. To use all the ordinances of God; especially service at church,\r\nand sacrament once a week; likewise every public meeting of the bands;\r\nthe ministry of the word every morning; private prayer every day;\r\nreading the Scriptures at every vacant hour; and observing all Fridays\r\nin the year as days of fasting or abstinence.\r\n\r\n4. Another of Wesley’s publications, in 1744, was “Modern Christianity\r\nexemplified at Wednesbury, and other adjacent places in Staffordshire.”\r\n12mo, twenty-eight pages. The substance of this pamphlet has been\r\nalready given in the account of the Staffordshire riots; but the prayer\r\nat the end of it is too remarkable to be passed without notice. The\r\nfollowing is an extract:—\r\n\r\n    “Lo, I come, if this soul and body may be useful to anything,\r\n    to do Thy will, O God. If it please Thee to use the power\r\n    Thou hast over dust and ashes, here they are to suffer Thy\r\n    good pleasure. If Thou pleasest to visit me either with pain\r\n    or dishonour, I will humble myself under it, and, through Thy\r\n    grace, be obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\r\n    Hereafter no man can take away anything from me, no life, no\r\n    honour, no estate; since I am ready to lay them down, as soon\r\n    as I perceive Thou requirest them at my hands. Nevertheless,\r\n    O Father, if Thou be willing, remove this cup from me; but if\r\n    not, Thy will be done.”\r\n\r\nWhat was the spirit of the ancient martyrs if this was not?\r\n\r\n5. A fifth publication, “Hymns for Times of Trouble and Persecution”\r\n(12mo, forty-seven pages), was issued in the names of “John and Charles\r\nWesley” unitedly. It contains thirteen hymns for times of trouble;\r\nsixteen for times of persecution; and four to be sung in a tumult.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Wesley’s publications, during the present year, were\r\ncollections or abridgments of the works of other authors, namely:—\r\n\r\n1. “A Collection of Moral and Sacred Poems from the most celebrated\r\nEnglish authors.” Three volumes, 1024 pages, in 12mo. The work is\r\ndedicated to “the right honourable the Countess of Huntingdon.” Wesley\r\ntruly observes, that there is nothing in the collection “contrary to\r\nvirtue; nothing that can in any way offend the chastest ear, or give\r\npain to the tenderest heart. Whatever is really essential to the most\r\nsublime divinity, as well as the purest and most refined morality,\r\nwill be found therein. The most just and important sentiments are here\r\nrepresented with all the ornaments both of wit and language, and in the\r\nclearest, fullest, strongest light.”\r\n\r\n“There is,” writes Mr. Marriott,[550] “a circumstance little known\r\nregarding this ‘Collection.’ A few months after the publication\r\nof these volumes, Dodsley (the publisher) called upon Wesley for\r\nreparation of a piracy, which the latter had unwittingly committed, and\r\nfor which he agreed to pay him £50.” This was done on February 8, 1745,\r\nby payment of a £20 bank note, and a cheque for £30, payable in three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n2. “A Brief Account of the occasion, process, and issue of a late\r\nTrial at the Assize held at Gloucester, 3rd March, 1743. Between some\r\nof the people called Methodists, Plaintiffs, and certain Persons of\r\nMinchinhampton, in the said county, Defendants. Extracted from Mr.\r\nWhitefield’s Letter. By John Wesley.” Twelve pages, 12mo.\r\n\r\nThis was a sort of companion tract to “Modern Christianity at\r\nWednesbury.” Appended is “a prayer for his majesty King George,” in ten\r\nverses of four lines each, which, in a somewhat altered form, is now\r\nthe 465th hymn in the Methodist Hymn-Book.\r\n\r\n3. “A Collection of Prayers for Families.” 12mo, 24 pages.\r\n\r\nWesley considered family religion as indispensable to the preservation\r\nand extension of the work of God. Some of the first Methodists\r\nneglected it; and, as a consequence, their children shook off all\r\nreligion and abandoned themselves to wickedness.[551] “Family\r\nreligion,” said Wesley, twenty years after this, “is the grand\r\ndesideratum among the Methodists.”[552]\r\n\r\nTo promote this, Wesley published his “Prayers for Families,” in 1744.\r\nThe prayers are only fourteen in number; that is, a prayer for every\r\nmorning and every evening during a single week; but anything more\r\ndevout, scriptural, appropriate, and religiously rich it would be\r\ndifficult to conceive.\r\n\r\n4. “The Case of John Nelson, written by himself. Published by John\r\nWesley.” 12mo, 36 pages.\r\n\r\n5. “An Extract of Count Zinzendorf’s Discourses on the Redemption of\r\nMan by the Death of Christ.” 12mo, 78 pages.\r\n\r\nThese loosely worded “Discourses,” sixteen in number, were first\r\npublished in 1740, in 12mo, two hundred and two pages. They were\r\nall founded upon Luther’s explanation of the second article of the\r\nApostles’ creed; “I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son our Lord.”\r\n\r\n6. “A Serious Call to a Holy Life. Extracted from a late author.”\r\n12mo, 230 pages. This was an abridgment of the well known work of\r\nWilliam Law, and was printed by John Gooding, of Newcastle upon Tyne.\r\nIt consists of nineteen chapters, dwelling on Christian devotion;\r\nthe duties of all orders and ranks of men and women, of all ages, to\r\npractise it; the happiness arising from doing so; and recommendations\r\nin reference to it.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give the reader, by any brief description here, an\r\nadequate idea of this powerful and pungent book. He must read it for\r\nhimself. When will the young people of the present day, imbibing the\r\nfroth of sensational writing, learn that books, like wine, are none the\r\nworse for being old?\r\n\r\n7. “The Life of God in the Soul of Man; or, the Nature and Excellency\r\nof the Christian Religion.” 12mo, forty-eight pages.\r\n\r\nThis was an extract from an excellent treatise, written by the Rev.\r\nHenry Scougal, a Scottish minister, who died at the early age of\r\ntwenty-eight, in the year 1678. The book breathes the sublimest piety;\r\nand, in style, is pure and elegant.\r\n\r\n8. “The Distinguishing Marks of a Work of the Spirit of God. Extracted\r\nfrom Mr. Edwards, minister of Northampton, in New England.” 12mo, 48\r\npages.\r\n\r\nBy publishing this calm, pointed, argumentative treatise, Wesley made\r\nits sentiments his own; and, from it, the reader may easily infer what\r\nwere Wesley’s opinions respecting the religious revival with which he\r\nand his contemporaries were connected. (See page 218.) The following is\r\na synopsis of the answers to objections.\r\n\r\nIt is no sign, that a work is not Divine, because it is carried on\r\nin a way unusual and extraordinary. The Spirit is sovereign in His\r\noperations. We ought not to limit God where He has not limited Himself.\r\nNeither is a work to be judged by any effects on the bodies of men;\r\nsuch as tears, trembling, groans, loud outcries, agonies, or faintings;\r\nfor there is reason to believe, that great outpourings of the Spirit,\r\nboth in the prophetic and apostolic ages, were not wholly without\r\nthese extraordinary effects. The same is true respecting religious\r\ncommotion among the people, for this is the natural result of such\r\na work. Further, though many of the converts may be guilty of great\r\nimprudences and irregularities, neither is this a sign that the work\r\nis not the work of God; for, in a mixed multitude of wise and unwise,\r\nyoung and old, all under powerful impressions, no wonder that some\r\nshould behave themselves imprudently. It was thus in the apostolic\r\nchurches, and this is not unlikely to continue while weakness is one\r\nof the elements of human nature. There may be errors in judgment, and\r\nsome delusions of Satan intermixed with the revival; but that is not\r\nconclusive evidence, that the work in general is not the work of the\r\nHoly Ghost. Some may fall away into scandalous practices; but, if we\r\nlook into church history, we shall find no instance of a great revival\r\nof religion but what has been attended with such relapses. The work\r\nmay have been promoted by ministers strongly preaching the terrors of\r\nthe law; but what of that? If there really be a hell of dreadful and\r\nnever ending torments, ought not those exposed to it to be earnestly\r\nwarned of their fearful danger? For ministers to preach of hell, and\r\nwarn sinners to avoid it in a cold, careless, hesitating manner, is to\r\ncontradict themselves, and to defeat their own purposes. The manner in\r\nwhich the thing is said is, in such a case, more effectual than the\r\nwords employed. It may be unreasonable to think of frightening a man to\r\nheaven; but it is not unreasonable to endeavour to frighten him away\r\nfrom hell.\r\n\r\nSuch, in substance, were the sentiments to which Wesley affixed his\r\n_imprimatur_ in 1744,—sentiments still worth pondering, because always\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nGreat revivals may be, often are, and perhaps must be, attended with\r\ncircumstances which enlightened and sober minded Christians dislike;\r\nbut rather than be without revivals, where is the man who loves Christ\r\nand the souls of sinners, who would not gladly crucify his own dislikes?\r\n\r\nTwelve months after this, in the year 1745, Wesley, appealing to men\r\nof reason and religion, who were in doubt, whether the revival then\r\nvouchsafed was the work of God, observed:—“You have all the proof\r\nof this you can reasonably expect or desire. That, in many places,\r\nabundance of notorious sinners are totally reformed, is declared\r\nby a thousand eye and ear witnesses both of their present and past\r\nbehaviour. What would you have more? What pretence can you have for\r\ndoubting any longer? Do you delay fixing your judgment till you see a\r\nwork of God, without any stumbling block attending it? That never was\r\nyet, nor ever will. ‘It must needs be that offences will come.’ And\r\nscarce ever was there such a work of God before, with so few as have\r\nattended this.”[553]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1745.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1745 Age 42]\r\n\r\nWhitefield, during the whole of the year 1745, was in America. Charles\r\nWesley spent about thirty-eight weeks in London; and about fourteen in\r\nBristol, Wales, and the west of England. Wesley himself was nearly five\r\nmonths in London and its vicinity; about a month in Bristol and the\r\nneighbourhood; two months were spent in a tour to Cornwall; and four\r\nmonths in two journeys to Newcastle and the north of England.\r\n\r\nPersecution somewhat abated, especially in the form of printed attacks\r\nand scandals; not because Methodism was less hated, but because the\r\nattention of the country was turned to the dangers arising from the\r\ninvasion of the popish Pretender.\r\n\r\nIn Cornwall, however, Thomas Maxfield was seized for a soldier, and\r\nwas put into the dungeon at Penzance. Edward Greenfield, of St. Just,\r\na tanner, with a wife and seven children, was arrested under a warrant\r\nsigned by Dr. Borlase. Wesley asked what objection there was to this\r\npeaceable and inoffensive man. The answer was, “The man is well enough\r\nin other things; but the gentlemen cannot bear his impudence. Why,\r\nsir, he says he knows his sins are forgiven.” This Cornish persecution\r\nwas principally promoted by men like Borlase and Eustick. The latter\r\ncame with a warrant for Wesley’s arrest; but sneaked away from its\r\nexecution, like a blustering poltroon. While Wesley was preaching at\r\nGwennap, two men, raging like maniacs, rode into the midst of the\r\ncongregation, and began to lay hold upon the people. In the midst of\r\nthe disturbance, Wesley and his friends commenced singing; when Mr. B.\r\nlost his patience, and bawled to his attendants, “Seize him, seize him.\r\nI say, seize the preacher for his majesty’s service.” The attendants\r\nnot moving, he cursed them with the greatest bitterness, leaped off his\r\nhorse, caught hold of Wesley’s cassock, crying, “I take you to serve\r\nhis majesty.” Wesley walked with him for three quarters of a mile,\r\nwhen the courage of the bumptious bravo failed him, and he was glad\r\nto let the poor parson go. The day after this ignoble capture, Wesley\r\nwas at Falmouth, where the rabble surrounded the house in which he was\r\nlodging, and roared, “Bring out the Canorum! Where is the Canorum?” (an\r\nunmeaning word which the Cornish generally used instead of Methodist.)\r\nThey then forced open the outer door, and setting their shoulders to\r\nthe inner one, cried out, “Avast, lads, avast!” Away went all the\r\nhinges; Wesley stepped into the midst of the privateering mob, and\r\nasked one after another, “To which of you have I done any wrong? To\r\nyou? Or you? Or you?” All seemed speechless, until, thus questioning\r\nhis furious assailants, Wesley found himself in the open street, where\r\nhe cried to the assembled crowd, “Neighbours, countrymen! Do you desire\r\nto hear me speak?” “Yes, yes,” they answered vehemently; “he shall\r\nspeak, he shall; no one shall hinder him!” Meanwhile, Mr. Thomas, the\r\nclergyman, and some other gentlemen came up; Wesley was rescued; his\r\nhorse was sent before him to Penryn; he was despatched by water; and\r\nan item of nine shillings and some odd pence appeared in the parochial\r\naccounts “for driving the Methodists out of the parish.”[554]\r\n\r\nWesley’s troubles, however, were not ended. His enemies ran along the\r\nshore to receive him at his landing. Wesley there confronted them, and,\r\nspeaking to their leader, said, “I wish you a good night;” to which\r\nthe wretch replied, “I wish you were in hell,” and then turned away\r\nwith his companions. Wesley mounted his horse, and hurried forward to\r\nTolcarn, where he had to preach the same evening. On the way, five\r\nwell dressed horsemen were awaiting him, with a special warrant, from\r\nthe Helstone magistrates, for his arrest. He rode into the midst of\r\nthem, and announced who he was. A friendly clergyman, Mr. Collins, of\r\nRedruth, accidentally came by, and told the gentlemen that he had known\r\nWesley at the Oxford university. Conversation followed, and Wesley was\r\nallowed to proceed upon his journey; one of those who had come out for\r\nhis arrest telling him, that the reason of all this annoyance was,\r\nthat all the gentlemen round about affirmed, that, for a long time, he\r\nhad been in France and Spain; was now sent to England by the Pretender,\r\nand was raising societies to join him at his coming.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, Wesley courageously rode to and fro,\r\npreaching from, “Love your enemies;” “Watch and pray;” and, “All that\r\nwill live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.” At Tolcarn,\r\nwhile he was preaching, the mob assembled, and suddenly pushed him\r\nfrom the high wall on which he was standing. At Trevonan, just after\r\nhe had begun his sermon, the constable and others came, and read the\r\nproclamation against riots. At Stithians, the churchwardens seized one\r\nof his hearers, and pressed him for a soldier.\r\n\r\nWhilst these outrages were being perpetrated in Cornwall, Richard Moss\r\nwas arrested at Epworth for preaching; but was delivered through the\r\ninterference of Mr. Maw, in whose house he prayed and sang hymns till\r\nmidnight; and then left for Robert Taylor’s, at Burnham, where he and\r\nthe Epworth Methodists continued praying and praising God, till about\r\nfour o’clock in the morning. At Betley, near Nantwich, a gentleman\r\nthreatened to hire a mob to pull down the Methodist meeting-house,\r\nand to send all the Methodists for soldiers. At Bristol, a Methodist\r\nbackslider declared he would “make affidavit that he had seen Wesley\r\nadminister extreme unction to a woman, and give her a wafer, and say\r\nthat was her passport to heaven.”[555] At Woodley, in Cheshire, John\r\nBennet and three other Methodists were pressed for soldiers, most of\r\nthe press gang being Dissenters. The reverend Mr. Henry Wickham, one\r\nof the magistrates for the west riding of Yorkshire, issued a warrant\r\nto the constable of Keighley, “to convey the body of Jonathan Reeves\r\nto his majesty’s gaol and castle of York;” the only crime of which\r\nJonathan was guilty being that of calling sinners to repentance;\r\nthough the reverend magistrate chose to describe him as “a spy among\r\nus, and a dangerous man to the person and government of his majesty\r\nKing George.”[556] In Exeter, says _The London Evening Post_, for May\r\n16, 1745, the Methodists had a meeting-house behind the Guildhall;\r\nand, on May 6, the mob gathered at the door, and pelted those who\r\nentered with potatoes, mud, and dung. On coming out, the congregation\r\nwere all beaten, without exception; many were trampled under foot;\r\nmany fled without their hats and wigs; and some without coats, or\r\nwith half of them torn to tatters. Some of the women were lamed, and\r\nothers stripped naked, and rolled most indecently in the kennel,\r\ntheir faces being besmeared with lampblack, flour, and dirt. This\r\ndisgraceful mob consisted of some thousands of cowardly blackguards,\r\nand the disturbance was continued till midnight. The same newspaper, in\r\nits number issued on May 25, relates, with a sneer, that a Methodist\r\nvagrant had been apprehended at Frome; that he was a person of “very\r\nill fame,” and was committed to prison; but another of the same sect,\r\n“a Scotchman, a travelling apostle,” had succeeded him, and was meeting\r\nwith surprising success. He had already wrought several miracles, one\r\nof which was making a deaf old woman hear angels playing on celestial\r\nharps in the upper regions; and another was that of converting his\r\nown oatmeal into cake, and transforming his water into wine. He also\r\ncured distempers of the body as well as of the mind; though he often\r\nkilled the one with his drugs, to save the other with his doctrine. The\r\n_Westminster Journal_ for June 8, 1745, narrates that a noted Methodist\r\npreacher, named Tolly, had been pressed for a soldier in Staffordshire,\r\nand had appeared before the magistrates, attended by many of his\r\n“deluded followers of both sexes, who pretended he was a learned and\r\nholy man; and yet, it appeared that he was only a journeyman joiner,\r\nand had done great mischief among the colliers.” The poor luckless\r\njoiner was, therefore, coupled to a sturdy tinker, and sent off to\r\nStafford jail. He had already been pressed once before, and the\r\nMethodists had subscribed £40 to obtain his freedom, and were intending\r\nto repeat the kindness; but the impeccable editor of the _Westminster\r\nJournal_ hopes that the magistrates will be proof against golden\r\nbribes; for “such wretches” as Tolly “are incendiaries in a nation,”\r\nand greatly to be dreaded.\r\n\r\nThese were the chief acts of violence committed against the Methodists\r\nin 1745. As already stated, the press was still employed, though it\r\nwas not so bitter as it had been previously. Newspapers and magazines\r\nfound that news about the Pretender’s invasion was more taking with the\r\npublic than elaborated diatribes against Wesley and his friends. During\r\nthe year, however, there was published, by a clergyman unknown to fame,\r\nan octavo pamphlet of eighty pages, with the title:—“An Apology for\r\nthe Clergy, in a Letter to a Gentleman of Fortune and great Reading,\r\nlately turned Methodist and Hermit; wherein is shown the weakness of\r\nthose Objections, which Separatists in general pretend first induced\r\nthem to leave the Established Church, and to look out for better guides\r\nsomewhere else. By J. Maud, M.A., vicar of St. Neots, in the county of\r\nHuntingdon.” Mr. Maud alleges, that there is a powerful confederacy\r\nagainst the Church,—“a mixed multitude of Socinians, Presbyterians,\r\nIndependents, Quakers, Anabaptists, Antinomians, Meer Moralists,\r\nJesuits, Free Thinkers, and Methodists, and an infinite tribe of\r\nnameless sects, all hallooed on by the vicar of Jesus Christ and his\r\ncreatures, to tear Christians to pieces, and to make sport for infidels\r\nand atheists.” The pamphlet is a spirited defence of the clergy, whom\r\nthe “Methodist and Hermit” had libelled, and an attempt to show, that\r\nit was no trivial matter to be a faultless minister of Christ in an age\r\nwhen it was considered “a rude affront to any polite audience to tell\r\nmen of their faults, or so much as to mention these harsh and dreadful\r\nsounding words, hell, damnation, devil, without a canting paraphrase,\r\nor a formal apology.”\r\n\r\nA second pamphlet, published in 1745, was, “The Question, Whether it be\r\nright to turn Methodist, considered in a Dialogue between two members\r\nof the Church of England.” 8vo, 79 pages. The Methodists are branded as\r\n“unskilful teachers, doing great mischief to the peace of the Church,\r\nand to the souls of poor, ignorant people; by raising vain janglings\r\nabout regeneration; by resolving all religion into instantaneous faith,\r\nand faith itself into impulses and mere animal sensations; by setting\r\naside all necessity for repentance; and by casting off _all_ works,\r\nas unnecessary to salvation.” The pamphlet is ably written; but is\r\nextremely false.\r\n\r\nAnother attack on Methodism was one published in the _Craftsman_, of\r\nJune 22, and copied in the _London Magazine_ and other periodicals of\r\nthe period. It was, in fact, an onslaught upon the government of the\r\nday, entitled “Ministerial Methodism, or Methodists in Politics;” but,\r\nin castigating ministers of state, it grossly calumniates ministers\r\nof Christ. The Methodists are an “unaccountable strange sect, whose\r\nreligion is founded on madness and folly.” They “hold, that there is no\r\njustification by good works, but by faith and grace only; and hereby\r\nbanish that Divine part of our constitution, reason; and cut off the\r\nmost essential recommendation to heaven, virtue.” By this “depraved\r\ndoctrine” of “weak and, perhaps, designing teachers, misguided souls\r\nare dangerously led astray.” The “men are far gone in their mad\r\nprinciples of religion, suspend the hand of industry, become inactive,\r\nand leave all to Providence, without exercising either their heads or\r\nhands.”\r\n\r\nThe article, though neatly written, was supremely silly: Wesley, at\r\nthe urgent request of his friends, answered it;[557] but the thing was\r\nfar more contemptible than some other attacks which had been allowed;\r\nproperly enough, to pass unnoticed.\r\n\r\nAnother anti-Methodist publication, issued in 1745, was entitled, “An\r\nEarnest and Affectionate Address to the People called Methodists.”\r\n12mo, 47 pages. This was published by the Society for Promoting\r\nChristian Knowledge, and was distributed gratuitously.[558] Its author,\r\nan old antagonist, was the Rev. Dr. Stebbing.[559] Two editions\r\nwere exhausted in 1745, and a third sent out in 1746. It allows the\r\nMethodists to be honest and well meaning; but they are “greatly imposed\r\nupon,” and “ignorantly serve the designs of enthusiasm, and give\r\ncredit to the most extravagant and groundless pretences.” The writer\r\nproceeds, with considerable ability, to examine the Methodist doctrines\r\nof regeneration, justification by faith alone, and the operations of\r\nthe Holy Spirit; and concludes by saying that, though the Methodist\r\nteachers at first were only distinguished by “a peculiar strictness\r\nand regularity, and a decent observance of the rules of the Church,\r\nit was not long that they kept within these bounds. Being admired\r\nand followed, they became vain and conceited, and proceeded to open\r\ncensures and contempt of their brethren. They grew loud and furious in\r\ntheir accusations and railings. They made most presumptuous pretences\r\nto Divine communications and directions;” and, when “their errors\r\nwere pointed out, by some of the highest and most considerable of the\r\nclergy, with all possible meekness and temper, their answers were saucy\r\nand petulant. Fresh bitterness arose; more arrogant boasting; and more\r\nuncharitable revilings. They seized a pulpit or two without leave; and,\r\nin defiance of the law, exercised their ministry in fields and commons,\r\nand other unlicensed places. They set aside and altered the liturgy at\r\ntheir pleasure, and made use of extempore effusions of their own in the\r\npublic worship of God.”\r\n\r\nSuch were some of the allegations brought against Wesley and his\r\nfriends at the instance of the Society for Promoting Christian\r\nKnowledge.\r\n\r\nAnother pamphlet, published in the same year, was “A Serious Address\r\nto Lay-Methodists to beware of the false pretences of their Teachers.\r\nWith an Appendix containing an account of the fatal and bloody effects\r\nof enthusiasm, in the case of the family of the Dutartres in South\r\nCarolina, which was attended with the murder of two persons, and the\r\nexecution of four for those murders. By a Sincere Protestant.” 8vo, 29\r\npages.\r\n\r\nThis was a frothy composition, asserting that “the Methodist preachers\r\nare wandering lights, gadding about with canting assurances, and\r\nleading people into bogs of delusion.” Its author was Dr. Zachary\r\nGrey, already mentioned (page 325) as the author of “The Quakers and\r\nMethodists compared.”[560]\r\n\r\nBesides all these attacks, Wesley had to endure much Moravian\r\nannoyance. At the commencement of the year, desiring to see once more\r\nhis old friend Gambold, he called at James Hutton’s, and there met\r\nMr. Simpson, “extremely gay, easy, and unconcerned;” “a new creature\r\nindeed! but not in the gospel sense.” Mr. Simpson, unhappily, was\r\na specimen of others. The Moravians meant well; but they held and\r\npreached the grand old doctrine of salvation by _faith only_, so\r\nunguardedly that, as a matter of course, the rank weed of antinomianism\r\nsprung out of the soil of Christian truth. Antinomianism, according\r\nto Wesley, was now a torrent; not only in London but out of it. At\r\nBristol, Wesley writes, “the Antinomians had taken true pains to\r\nseduce those who were showing their faith by their works; but they\r\nreaped little fruit of their bad labour; for, upon the most diligent\r\ninquiry, I could not find that seven persons out of seven hundred\r\nhad been turned out of the old Bible way.” Whitefield, writing from\r\nAmerica, remarks: “Antinomianism, I find, begins to show its head,\r\nand stalk abroad. May the glorious Redeemer cause it to hide its head\r\nagain; and prevent His children’s spirits being embittered against\r\neach other.”[561] In August, James Hutton, by order of Zinzendorf,\r\npublished, in the _Daily Advertiser_, an advertisement, declaring that\r\nthe Moravians had no connection with the two Wesleys; and subjoining\r\none of the count’s prophecies, that Wesley and his brother would “soon\r\nrun their heads against the wall.” To this Wesley simply said: “We\r\nwill not, if we can help it.” Dissensions also had sprung up among the\r\nUnitas Fratrum themselves. Richard Viney had denounced Zinzendorf’s\r\n“more than papal domination;” and large numbers of the Yorkshire\r\nMoravians had sympathised with him. Zinzendorf was furious, and, in\r\nFebruary 1744, wrote from Germany as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “I hereby declare, that I will have nothing more to do with\r\n    those English Brethren, who have been mixed up in Viney’s\r\n    rebellion. I disapprove of the absolution that is given to\r\n    such Corah spirits. I laugh at the English national self\r\n    righteousness in matters relating to our salvation. I desire\r\n    to be erased from the list of English labourers, and not to be\r\n    named among them, until all accomplices in the late revolt make\r\n    an acknowledgment in writing of their having been deceived by\r\n    Satan.\r\n\r\n    “The well-known little fool and poor sinner,\r\n\r\n    “LUDWIG.”[562]\r\n\r\nThis was pitiful tomfoolery; the raging of a lilliputian and\r\ndisappointed pope.\r\n\r\nDuring the year, a 12mo pamphlet, of forty-one pages, was published,\r\nwith the title, “Extracts of Letters relating to Methodists and\r\nMoravians. By a Layman;” in which the Moravians are censured—1. For\r\nlaying aside the use of their intellectual faculties in _religious\r\nmatters_. 2. For refusing to take oaths before a magistrate. 3. For\r\ndeclining to take up arms in defence of their country, at the command\r\nof the civil power. And, 4. For their praying to and praising so\r\nconstantly the Son of God, and so very seldom the Father. This was\r\nsupposed to be written by Sir John Thorold; but as it makes no attack\r\nupon Wesley and his immediate followers it need not be farther noticed.\r\n\r\nAnother, and more important publication, was the following:—“Remarks on\r\nthe Rev. Mr. John Wesley’s last Journal, wherein he gives an account\r\nof the tenets and proceedings of the Moravians, especially those in\r\nEngland, and of the divisions and perplexities of the Methodists:\r\nshowing, by the concessions of Mr. Wesley himself, the many errors\r\nrelating to faith and practice, which have already arisen among these\r\ndeluded people; and, in a particular manner, explaining the very fatal\r\ntendency of denying good works to be conditions of our justification.\r\nIn a letter to that gentleman. By Thomas Church, A.M., vicar of\r\nBattersea, and prebendary of St. Paul’s.” 8vo, 76 pages.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet is calmly and ably written, and thus concludes: “The\r\nconsequences of Methodism, which have hitherto appeared, are bad enough\r\nto induce you to leave it. It has introduced many disorders—Enthusiasm,\r\nAntinomianism, Calvinism, a neglect and contempt of God’s ordinances\r\nand almost all other duties, a great increase of our sects and\r\ndivisions, and, in fine, presumption and despair in greater abundance\r\nthan they were known before.”\r\n\r\nThe letter is dated, November 3, 1744, and has the following\r\npostscript:—“If you think proper to return any answer, I hope you will\r\nattentively consider the points objected to you, and not put me off\r\nwith such a slight, superficial, declamatory thing as Mr. Whitefield,\r\nwithout any regard to his own character or the importance of the\r\nsubject, published last year under the title of an answer to my letter\r\nto him; in which he did not vouchsafe to consider any one argument I\r\nhad urged against him, and which no serious man could think deserved\r\nany notice.”\r\n\r\nThe “Remarks” deserved an answer. Wesley acknowledged, in after years,\r\nthat Church “wrote as a gentleman.”[563] “Mr. Church,” said he, in\r\n1777, “was another kind of opponent than Mr. Rowland Hill; a gentleman,\r\na scholar, and a Christian; and as such he both spoke and wrote.”[564]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, first of all, Mr. Webb published a letter in vindication\r\nof Wesley’s Journal, in reply to Mr. Church;[565] and then Wesley\r\nhimself issued a 12mo pamphlet of forty-six pages, entitled, “An Answer\r\nto the Rev. Mr. Church’s Remarks on the Rev. Mr. John Wesley’s last\r\nJournal.”\r\n\r\nWesley thus begins:—“Reverend sir,—My first desire and prayer to God\r\nis, that I may live peaceably with all men: my next, that if I must\r\ndispute at all, it may be with a man of understanding. Thus far, I\r\nrejoice on the present occasion. I rejoice also, that I have confidence\r\nof your sincerity, of your real desire to promote the glory of God, by\r\npeace and goodwill among men. I am likewise thankful to God for your\r\ncalm manner of writing (a few paragraphs excepted); and yet more for\r\nthis,—that such an opponent should, by writing in such a manner, give\r\nme an opportunity of explaining myself on those very heads whereon I\r\nwanted an occasion so to do.”\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to say, that he wholly disapproved of the doctrines,\r\n“that there are no degrees in faith; that, in order to attain faith, we\r\nmust abstain from all the ordinances of God; that a believer does not\r\ngrow in holiness; and that he is not obliged to keep the commandments\r\nof God;” but, at the same time, he remarks, that he had already\r\ncleared the _Moravian church_ from the charge of holding the first of\r\nthese doctrines; that, with respect to the ordinances of God, their\r\npractice was better than their principle; and that he never knew a\r\nMoravian, except Molther, who affirmed that a believer does not grow in\r\nholiness. “Still,” he adds, “I am afraid their whole church is tainted\r\nwith quietism, universal salvation, and antinomian opinions.” “As a\r\nchurch, they exalted themselves above measure, and despised others.\r\nHe had scarce heard one Moravian brother own his church to be wrong\r\nin anything. Many of them he had heard speak of it, as if it were\r\ninfallible; and some of them had set it up as the judge of all the\r\nearth, of all persons as well as doctrines. Some had said, there was no\r\ntrue church but theirs, and that there were no true Christians out of\r\nit. These were exceeding great mistakes; yet in as great mistakes holy\r\nmen had both lived and died;—Thomas à Kempis, for instance, and Francis\r\nSales.” He condemns them for “despising and decrying self denial; for\r\ntheir extending Christian liberty beyond all warrant of holy writ; for\r\ntheir want of zeal for good works; and, above all, for their using\r\nguile;” but he wishes not to condemn all for the sake of some, and\r\nexpresses the belief that, next to some thousands in the Church of\r\nEngland, that is mainly the Methodists, the Moravians, with whom he had\r\nformed acquaintance, were, upon the whole, the best Christians in the\r\nworld. They had much evil among them, but more good. They were the most\r\nself inconsistent people now existing; and yet he could not help but\r\nspeak of them with tender affection, were it only for the benefits he\r\nhad received from them; and, if the stumbling blocks above mentioned\r\nwere put away, he should desire union with them above all things under\r\nheaven.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Wesley gives his latest thoughts upon justification by\r\nfaith alone, as published in his “Farther Appeal to Men of Reason and\r\nReligion,” which will be noticed hereafter.\r\n\r\nIn reply to Church’s assertion, that Wesley was guilty of enthusiasm to\r\nthe highest degree, Wesley remarks, that he is no more like Church’s\r\npicture of an enthusiast than he is like a centaur. He made the word\r\nof God the rule of all his actions, and no more followed any secret\r\nimpulse instead thereof, than he followed Mahommed or Confucius. He\r\nrested not on ecstasies at all, for he never felt them; but judged of\r\nhis spiritual estate by the improvement of his heart and the tenour\r\nof his life conjointly. He desired neither his dreams nor his waking\r\nthoughts to be at all regarded, unless just so far as they agreed with\r\nthe oracles of God.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Moravians, reference must be made to another\r\npamphlet, issued in 1745. “A Short View of the Difference between the\r\nMoravian Brethren lately in England and the Rev. Mr. John and Charles\r\nWesley. Extracted chiefly from a late Journal. London: printed by W.\r\nStrahan. Sold at the Foundery, etc. 1745.” 12mo, 24 pages. The pamphlet\r\nis dated, May 20, 1745, and is signed by both the Wesleys. Appended\r\nare six hymns bearing on the subject. The differences are contained\r\nin ten propositions; but having been referred to so frequently in the\r\npreceding pages, it is scarcely necessary to repeat them here. Suffice\r\nit to say, that the publication of these “Differences” was probably\r\nowing to the publication of Church’s remarks on Wesley’s Journal; and,\r\nthat it was one, if not the main, reason of Zinzendorf and Hutton\r\npublishing, in the _Daily Advertiser_, that the Moravians had now no\r\nconnection with the Wesleys. Wesley, in his pamphlet, uses language\r\nmore than ordinarily strong. He pronounces several of the Moravian\r\ndogmas “utterly false.” He declares, that Zinzendorf’s definition\r\nof faith, namely, the historical knowledge that Christ has been a\r\nman and suffered death for us, “is a proposition directly subversive\r\nof the whole of the Christian revelation;” and that his doctrine,\r\nthat “a believer is not holy _in himself_, but in Christ only,” is\r\n“a palpable self contradiction, and senseless jargon.” Zinzendorf’s\r\ntemper was touchy, and it is not surprising, that he resented Wesley’s\r\nplain speaking, and commanded Hutton to publish the advertisement just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe controversy still continued; and, during 1745, two other tracts\r\nwere published by Wesley. (1) “A Dialogue between an Antinomian and his\r\nfriend.” 12mo, 12 pages. (2) “A Second Dialogue between an Antinomian\r\nand his friend.” 12mo, 12 pages.\r\n\r\nIn both these tracts, the monstrousness of the Moravian and other\r\nerrors is mercilessly exposed and censured. “All that is really\r\nuncommon in your doctrine,” says Wesley to his antinomian friend, “is\r\na heap of broad absurdities, in most of which you grossly contradict\r\nyourselves, as well as Scripture and common sense. In the meantime, you\r\nboast and vapour, as if _ye were the men, and wisdom should die with\r\nyou_. I pray God to humble you, and prove you, and show you what is in\r\nyour heart!”\r\n\r\nThis was partly written in answer to a Dialogue that had been\r\npublished by William Cudworth, who was, for some years, a follower of\r\nWhitefield, and then became minister of an Independent congregation,\r\nin Margaret Street, London, and died in 1763.[566] The biographer of\r\nthe Countess of Huntingdon states, that Cudworth “died in the comforts\r\nof the doctrines of grace, leaving behind him a character for eminent\r\nholiness and integrity.”[567] Wesley’s description of the man is widely\r\ndifferent; but, if Wesley ever felt the least bitterness towards any\r\nof his opponents, it was towards Cudworth. He describes him as an\r\nAntinomian; an absolute, avowed enemy to the law of God, which he never\r\npreached, or professed to preach, but termed all legalists who did.\r\nWith him, preaching the law was an abomination. He would preach Christ,\r\nas he called it, but without one word either of holiness or good\r\nworks.[568]\r\n\r\nMr. Cudworth will again cross our path. Suffice it to say here, that,\r\nbetween him and Wesley, no love was lost. Affection for him was at\r\nzero; and he abhorred Wesley “as much as he did the pope, and ten times\r\nmore than he did the devil.”[569]\r\n\r\nAs already stated, Wesley made, during 1745, two journeys to Newcastle\r\nand the north of England.\r\n\r\nThe first of these was commenced on the 18th of February, and lasted\r\nto the 11th of May. Richard Moss was his companion, and not a few were\r\nthe adventures with which they met. Locomotion was rendered extremely\r\ndifficult in consequence of snow. In some places, a thaw, succeeded by\r\na frost, had made the ground like glass; and often they were obliged to\r\nwalk, it being impossible to ride, their horses frequently falling,\r\neven while they were leading them. At Gateshead Fell, the whole country\r\nappeared a great pathless waste of white; and, but for an honest man\r\nwho became their guide, they knew not how to reach Newcastle. Wesley\r\nwrites:—“Many a rough journey have I had before, but one like this I\r\nnever had; between wind, and hail, and rain, and ice, and snow, and\r\ndriving sleet, and piercing cold: but it is past; these days will\r\nreturn no more, and are therefore as though they had never been.”\r\nThis rough journey of two hundred and eighty miles was performed on\r\nhorseback, in six days, at the rate of nearly fifty miles a day.\r\n\r\nThe besetting sin of the Newcastle Methodists was the being offended\r\nwith each other; and Wesley’s first work was to reconcile wrangling\r\nneighbours. On the second Sunday after his arrival, a brutal bully,\r\nwho had been accustomed to abuse the Orphan House family, and to throw\r\nstones at them, assaulted Wesley in Pilgrim Street, and cursed and\r\npushed him. The next day the following characteristic note was sent:—\r\n\r\n    “ROBERT YOUNG,—I expect to see you between this and Friday,\r\n    and to hear from you, that you are sensible of your fault;\r\n    otherwise, in pity to your soul, I shall be obliged to inform\r\n    the magistrates of your assaulting me yesterday in the street.\r\n\r\n    “I am, your real friend,\r\n    “JOHN WESLEY.”\r\n\r\nRobert Young immediately came, and meekly begged pardon, and promised\r\nto amend his ways.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of March, Wesley wrote a long letter to a friend, giving\r\nan account of the way in which the Methodist societies had sprung into\r\nexistence, and then stating succinctly the present position of himself\r\nand his coadjutors. They were willing to make any concession, which\r\ntheir conscience would permit, in order to heal the breach between\r\nthe clergy and themselves; but they could not desist from preaching\r\nthe doctrine of inward and present salvation, as attainable by faith\r\nalone; nor could they promise not to preach in private houses, or\r\nin the open air; for, as things were now circumstanced, this would\r\namount to a promise not to preach at all. They could not, with a safe\r\nconscience, dissolve their societies, for they apprehended that many\r\nsouls would be lost thereby; neither could they advise the members one\r\nby one, their number rendering this impossible. They could not suffer\r\nthose who walked disorderly still to mingle with the rest, because\r\nevil communications corrupt good manners; nor could they discharge the\r\nleaders, because it was through the leaders that disorderly walkers\r\nwere detected. While they were resolved to behave with reverence\r\ntowards the bishops of the Church, and with tenderness both to the\r\ncharacter and persons of the inferior clergy, they desired not to be\r\nadmitted to their pulpits, if they believed them to be preachers of\r\nfalse doctrine, or had the least scruple of conscience concerning this;\r\nbut, at the same time, they desired that those clergymen who believed\r\ntheir doctrines to be true, and had no scruple at all in the matter,\r\nshould not be either publicly or privately discouraged from inviting\r\nthem to preach in their churches. If any one thought them heretics or\r\nschismatics, and deemed it his duty to preach or print against them,\r\nbe it so; they had not the least objection; but, before doing so, they\r\ndesired that he would calmly consider both sides of the question,\r\nand not condemn them unheard. If they were guilty of either Popery,\r\nsedition, or immorality, they desired no favour; but they also desired,\r\nthat senseless tales concerning them should not be credited without\r\nproof. They desired not any preferment, favour, or recommendation,\r\nfrom authorities either in Church or state; but they asked—1. That, if\r\nanything material were laid to their charge, they might be permitted to\r\nanswer for themselves. 2. That the clergy and magistrates would hinder\r\ntheir dependants from stirring up the rabble against them. And, 3.\r\nThat they would effectually suppress, and thoroughly discountenance,\r\nall riots and popular insurrections, which evidently strike at the\r\nfoundation of all government, whether of Church or state.\r\n\r\nSuch was Wesley’s position in 1745. Though the document was not\r\npublished in his Journal for eight years afterwards, it was, in fact, a\r\nmanifesto defining his relations to Church and state, and the course of\r\naction he felt it his duty to pursue; and, viewed in such a light, it\r\nis of great importance.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay at Newcastle, Wesley received and entertained a\r\nstrange visitor in his Orphan House. This was none other than a popish\r\npriest. Twelve months before, a royal proclamation had been published,\r\nordering the laws against papists to be enforced, and commanding all\r\nsuch religionists to depart from the cities of London and Westminster;\r\nand likewise forbidding them to leave their country homes, in any\r\ndirection, for more than five miles’ distance. This proclamation was\r\noccasioned by the preparations that were being made by the young\r\nPretender to invade Great Britain. Papists, and especially papistical\r\npriests, were regarded, by the general public, with suspicion and\r\nabhorrence. This was natural. Their disloyalty to the house of Hanover\r\nwas a well known fact; and their intrigues, in favour of the Stuart\r\nfamily, were now culminating in the approaching invasion on behalf of\r\nthe eldest son of James II. Under such circumstances, it was a bold, we\r\nthink an imprudent, act for Wesley to make a priest of the Church of\r\nRome his guest. Still the visit led to results which, to the writer at\r\nleast, are interesting.\r\n\r\nThe priest’s name was Adams, or Watson Adams. His home was at\r\nOsmotherley (the author’s native place), a village of about a thousand\r\ninhabitants, sixty miles south of Newcastle. The place had been famous\r\nas a papistical settlement, and was still resorted to by not a few\r\nadherents of that religion. The writer’s grandmother, for a long series\r\nof years, walked, every Sunday morning, over a bleak, roadless moor,\r\nfull of bogs and pitfalls, a distance of at least twelve miles there\r\nand back, for the purpose of attending, in Osmotherley chapel, the\r\nreading of a few Latin prayers, not a word of which had she scholarship\r\nenough to understand. Here had been an important convent of Franciscan\r\nfriars, the chapel of which was still standing. In the immediate\r\nneighbourhood were the ruins of another popish edifice, known by the\r\nname of “the Lady’s chapel”; and, within a mile, were the beautiful and\r\nextensive remains of Mount Grace, a Carthusian priory, founded in 1396.\r\n\r\nWesley’s account of the priest’s visit is as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “March 28.—A gentleman called at our house, and said, that\r\n    he lived at Osmotherley, in Yorkshire; and had heard so many\r\n    strange accounts of the Methodists, that he could not rest\r\n    till he came to inquire for himself. I told him he was welcome\r\n    to stay as long as he pleased, if he could live on our Lenten\r\n    fare. He made no difficulty of this, and willingly stayed till\r\n    the Monday sennight following; when he returned home, fully\r\n    satisfied with his journey.”\r\n\r\nThe odd acquaintance thus begun was perpetuated. A week after this\r\n(on Easter Monday), Wesley began the day by preaching, at half-past\r\nfour o’clock, to a large congregation, including “many of the rich\r\nand honourable.” He then set out for London, and, at eight o’clock,\r\npreached in the open air, to “a large and quiet congregation,” at\r\nChester-le-street. Starting again, he reached Northallerton in the\r\nevening, and made the inn his preaching place. The priest, Adams, and\r\nsome of his neighbours, including Elizabeth Tyerman, a Quakeress,\r\nformed part of his congregation. The priest wished Wesley to come\r\nand preach in his house at Osmotherley. The invitation was at once\r\naccepted; Wesley mounted; and, travelling up hill and down hill, seven\r\nmiles more, reached the village a little before ten at night; having\r\nridden during the day, over execrable roads, a distance of at least\r\nsixty miles, and preached thrice. Of course, at this season of the\r\nyear, it had long been dark; and, in a village so sequestered, most of\r\nthe inhabitants had retired to rest; but the priest and his friends\r\nwent round the place, and, arousing the people, succeeded, in about\r\nan hour, in collecting a congregation in the chapel which formerly\r\nbelonged to the Franciscan friars. Wesley preached to them, and, after\r\nmidnight, went to bed, feeling, as he expressed it, “no weariness at\r\nall.” At five in the morning, he preached again, on Romans iii. 22,\r\na sermon, in a popish chapel, on the great anti-popish doctrine of\r\njustification by faith alone, part of the congregation having sat up\r\nall night for fear they should not awake in sufficient time to hear\r\nhim. Many of them either were or had been papists, and one who was\r\npresent was the Quakeress already mentioned. After the sermon, this\r\nunbaptized woman, abruptly addressing Wesley, asked, “Dost thou think\r\nwater baptism an ordinance of Christ?” Wesley replied, “What saith\r\nPeter? ‘Who can forbid water, that these should not be baptized, who\r\nhave received the Holy Ghost even as we?’” Wesley adds: “I spoke but\r\nlittle more, before she cried out, ‘’Tis right! ’tis right! I will be\r\nbaptized.’ And so she was, the same hour.“[570]\r\n\r\nOn reaching Leeds, a week afterwards, Wesley wrote, as follows, to his\r\nbrother Charles.\r\n\r\n    “LEEDS, _April 23, 1745_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR BROTHER,—It was time for me to give them the ground\r\n    at Newcastle, and to fly for my life. I grew more and more\r\n    honourable every day: the rich and great flocking to us\r\n    together, so that many times the room would not hold them.\r\n    Iniquity, for the present, hath stopped her mouth; and it is\r\n    almost fashionable to speak well of us. In all appearance, if\r\n    I had stayed a month longer, the mayor and aldermen would have\r\n    been with us.”\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds to give an account of his journey to Northallerton,\r\nwhere he found “a noble people, who received the word with all\r\nreadiness of mind”; and of his setting out for Osmotherley, where he\r\nsays: “I preached in a large chapel which belonged, a few years since,\r\nto a convent of Franciscan friars. I found I was got into the very\r\ncentre of all the papists in the north of England. ‘_Commessatorem haud\r\nsatis commodum._’ This also hath God wrought.”[571]\r\n\r\nThus began Methodism in Osmotherley, Wesley preaching the first\r\nsermon, in a popish chapel, at eleven o’clock at night, having been\r\nbrought to the place by a popish priest and a Quaker woman. A society\r\nwas formed soon after, the original class papers and society book\r\nof which, for 1750, and onwards, are still in existence. Four years\r\nafterwards, a chapel was erected, which still stands, and which, up to\r\nthe year 1865, for the long period of one hundred and eleven years,\r\nwas uninterruptedly occupied as a Methodist place of worship, being,\r\nwith one exception (Coleford, in Somersetshire), the oldest Methodist\r\nchapel in the world, continuously used as such. In it, the writer was\r\nconverted, and painfully he regrets that, in the present mania for new\r\nchapels, the society, without the least necessity, were barbarous\r\nenough to quit it for a more modern structure, not a whit more\r\nadapted to their church necessities, and, of course, destitute of the\r\nunequalled memories belonging to the ugly, but venerable pile, now, we\r\nfear, left to rats and ruin.\r\n\r\nOsmotherley, nestled beneath moorland mountains, was one of Wesley’s\r\nfavourite haunts. Though seven miles from the direct road between\r\nLondon and Newcastle, and a place difficult to reach, he paid at least\r\nsixteen visits to the place to which he was so strangely introduced.\r\nNor did he forget or neglect his old friend, the popish priest. His\r\nhouse, on some occasions, was Wesley’s home. When he visited him, in\r\n1776, he found him “just quivering over the grave”; and, at his visit\r\na year later, he writes:—“I found my old friend was just dead, after\r\nliving a recluse life near fifty years. From one that attended him, I\r\nlearned that the sting of death was gone, and he calmly delivered up\r\nhis soul to God.”\r\n\r\nLeaving a place, for lingering too long at which the writer craves\r\nforbearance, we must follow Wesley in his evangelistic wanderings. He\r\nmade his way to Sykehouse, to Epworth, and to Grimsby, at which last\r\nmentioned town he preached to a “stupidly rude and noisy congregation,\r\nencouraged thereto by a drunken alehouse keeper.” At Epworth, he\r\npreached at the market cross, having most of the adults in the town\r\nto hear him. He went to his father’s church, and there heard his old\r\nacquaintance, John Romley, preach a sermon which, “from beginning to\r\nend, was a railing accusation.” He returned to Leeds, Armley, Birstal,\r\nand Bradford.\r\n\r\nLeaving the west riding, he made a tour in Lancashire, Cheshire, and\r\nDerbyshire, and then came round to Sheffield, where he preached on the\r\nfloor of the Methodist meeting-house, “which the good Protestant mob\r\nhad just pulled down,” to the largest and one of the quietest Sheffield\r\ncongregations he had ever seen. He then made his way to Nottingham,\r\nWednesbury, and Birmingham, at the last of which places “stones and\r\ndirt were flying from every side, almost without intermission, for near\r\nan hour.” On Saturday, May 11, he got to London, from which he had been\r\nabsent about twelve weeks. Here he found things in an unsatisfactory\r\nstate. There were more than two thousand members, above two thirds\r\nof whom were women.[572] “The sower of tares had not been idle. Many\r\nwere shaken; and some, who once seemed pillars, were moved from their\r\nsteadfastness.” Numbers were “hugely in love” with what Wesley calls,\r\n“that solemn trifle, Robert Barclay’s Apology.” This he and his brother\r\nread over with them. “Their eyes were opened; they saw Barclay’s\r\nnakedness, and were ashamed.”\r\n\r\nHaving employed a month in London, Wesley set out for Cornwall, where\r\nhe spent the next five weeks. The persecutions he encountered have\r\nbeen related at the commencement of the present chapter. Suffice it to\r\nremark here, that, during this Cornish tour, he did what he was rarely\r\npermitted to do elsewhere; he preached in not fewer than four churches,\r\nwith the consent, or at the request, of their respective ministers. An\r\nodd event also happened to him at St. Just, where, as he himself was\r\nabout to begin to preach, a kind of gentlewoman took his place, and\r\n“scolded, screamed, spit, and stamped, wrung her hands and distorted\r\nher face,” most violently. She had been bred a papist, and had been\r\nrejoiced to hear that Wesley was one; but, being now undeceived and\r\ndisappointed, her anger was quite equal to what her joy had been. Like\r\na true philosopher, Wesley let the vociferous lady have all the talking\r\nto herself, and “took no notice of her at all, good or bad.” Wesley\r\nreturned to London on August 16.\r\n\r\nTerrible was the national excitement which now existed. A few weeks\r\nbefore, Charles Edward Stuart had embarked from Brittany, with about\r\nfifty of his Scotch and Irish adherents, and had set up his standard in\r\nScotland, emblazoned with the motto, “_Tandem triumphans_.” On the 4th\r\nof September, he proclaimed his father in the town of Perth; within a\r\nfortnight, he entered Edinburgh; and, a few days afterwards, fought the\r\nroyal troops at Preston Pans, and was victorious. Under the pretentious\r\ntitle of “regent of the kingdoms of England, Scotland, France, and\r\nIreland,” he marched his increasing forces to Carlisle, Lancaster,\r\nManchester, and Derby; and was then driven back to Scotland, where, on\r\nApril 16, 1746, was fought the decisive battle of Culloden. These brief\r\nremarks will help to illustrate Wesley’s Journal.\r\n\r\nFive days after the proclamation of the Pretender, namely, on September\r\n9, Wesley set out from London to Newcastle. On his way he called upon\r\nDoddridge, the great Dissenter, and addressed his students. His purpose\r\nwas to go round by Epworth; but, “hearing of more and more commotions\r\nin the north,” he hastened to Newcastle. At Leeds, the mob pelted him\r\nand his society with dirt and stones, and were “ready to knock out\r\nall their brains for joy that the Duke of Tuscany was emperor.” At\r\nOsmotherley, he took occasion to visit the Carthusian priory, already\r\nmentioned; and, after describing the walls, cells, and gardens,\r\nexpressed a sentiment which, however just, was at that time far from\r\nbeing popular:—“Who knows but some of the poor superstitious monks,\r\nwho once served God here according to the light they had, may meet us,\r\nby-and-by, in that house of God, ‘not made with hands, eternal, in the\r\nheavens’?” On September 18, he reached Newcastle, in, what he calls, an\r\n“acceptable time.”\r\n\r\nNews had just arrived that the Pretender had entered Edinburgh. The\r\ninhabitants were in the utmost consternation. Wesley at once commenced\r\npreaching, selecting as his text, “Who can tell, if God will return,\r\nand repent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not?”\r\nThe _Newcastle Courant_, for September 14 to September 21, is before\r\nus, containing an account of an association of his majesty’s Protestant\r\nsubjects in Ireland, pledging their faith and honour, that they will,\r\nat the hazard of their lives and fortunes, oppose the abominable and\r\nunnatural rebellion now carried on in favour of the popish Pretender.\r\nThere is also an address to the king by seven hundred and thirty of\r\nthe merchants of London, and from the lord provost, magistrates, and\r\ncouncil of Edinburgh, to the same effect.\r\n\r\nThe following loyal, if not finished, lines are published:—\r\n\r\n    “Rouse, Britons, rouse, before it be too late,\r\n    Join heart and hand, or slavery is your fate;\r\n    Remember how your fathers bravely stood,\r\n    And neither spared their treasure, nor their blood,\r\n    Preserved your liberties, and Church, and state;\r\n    Your sons cry out, _Remember eighty-eight_.”\r\n\r\nThe day after Wesley’s arrival, Mr. Ridley, the mayor, summoned all\r\nthe householders of Newcastle to meet him at the town hall, and to\r\nsign an agreement, to the effect that they would hazard their goods\r\nand lives, in defending the town against the common enemy. He ordered\r\nthe townsmen to be under arms, and to mount guard in turns. Pilgrim\r\nStreet gate, just outside of which was Wesley’s Orphan House, was\r\nwalled up; and Wesley and his society spent the day in fasting and in\r\nprayer. The agreement submitted by the mayor, and which was signed by\r\neight hundred and thirteen inhabitants of the town, was, that they “do\r\nvoluntarily oblige themselves to appear in person, or to provide daily,\r\nor when required, an able man to act in concert with his majesty’s\r\nforces in the town, for the defence thereof, against all his majesty’s\r\nenemies.”[573] As Wesley did not accompany the householders to meet the\r\nmayor, he wrote to him the following letter:—\r\n\r\n    “_To the Worshipful the Mayor of Newcastle._\r\n\r\n    “SIR,—My not waiting upon you at the town hall was not owing to\r\n    any want of respect. I reverence you for your office’ sake; and\r\n    much more for your zeal in the execution of it. I would to God,\r\n    every magistrate in the land would copy after such an example!\r\n    Much less was it owing to any disaffection to his majesty King\r\n    George. But I knew not how far it might be either necessary or\r\n    proper for me to appear on such an occasion. I have no fortune\r\n    at Newcastle: I have only the bread I eat, and the use of a\r\n    little room for a few weeks in the year.\r\n\r\n    “All I can do for his majesty, whom I honour and love,—I think\r\n    not less than I did my own father,—is this: I cry unto God,\r\n    day by day, in public and in private, to put all his enemies\r\n    to confusion: and I exhort all that hear me to do the same;\r\n    and, in their several stations, to exert themselves as loyal\r\n    subjects; who, so long as they fear God, cannot but honour the\r\n    king.\r\n\r\n    “Permit me, sir, to add a few words more, out of the fulness of\r\n    my heart. I am persuaded you fear God, and have a deep sense\r\n    that His kingdom ruleth over all. Unto whom then (I may ask\r\n    you), should we flee for succour, but unto Him whom, by our\r\n    sins, we have justly displeased? O, sir, is it not possible to\r\n    give any check to these overflowings of ungodliness? to the\r\n    open, flagrant wickedness, the drunkenness and profaneness,\r\n    which so abound, even in our streets? I just take leave to\r\n    suggest this. May the God whom you serve direct you in this,\r\n    and all things! This is the daily prayer of, sir,\r\n\r\n    “Your obedient servant, for Christ’s sake,\r\n    “JOHN WESLEY.”\r\n\r\nThis was written on September 21, on which day arrived the news of\r\nGeneral Cope’s disastrous defeat at Preston Pans. Newcastle was seized\r\nwith panic. Many of the opulent of the inhabitants fled with the utmost\r\nprecipitation, taking their most valuable effects with them. Wesley\r\nwrites:—\r\n\r\n    “September 22.—The walls are mounted with cannon, and all\r\n    things prepared for sustaining an assault. Our poor neighbours,\r\n    on either hand, are busy in removing their goods. And most of\r\n    the best houses in our street are left without either furniture\r\n    or inhabitants. Those within the walls are almost equally busy\r\n    in carrying away their money and their goods; and more and more\r\n    of the gentry every hour ride southward as fast as they can. At\r\n    eight, I preached at Gateshead, in a broad part of the street,\r\n    near the popish chapel, on the wisdom of God in governing the\r\n    world.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, part of the Northumberland militia entered the town, namely,\r\nabout four hundred horse, and above two hundred foot,[574] all well\r\narmed, and headed by the county gentlemen. Still the alarms continued,\r\nand the storm seemed nearer every day. “Many,” says Wesley, “wondered\r\nwe would still stay without the walls; others told us, we must remove\r\nquickly; for if the cannon began to play from the top of the gates,\r\nthey would beat all the house about our ears. This made me look how\r\nthe cannon on the gates were planted; and I could not but adore the\r\nprovidence of God, for it was obvious—(1) they were all planted in such\r\na manner, that no shot could touch our house; (2) the cannon on Newgate\r\nso secured us on one side, and those upon Pilgrim Street gate on the\r\nother, that none could come near our house, either way, without being\r\ntorn in pieces.”\r\n\r\nAmid the most terrible alarms, Wesley continued preaching in Newcastle,\r\nand visiting the country societies round about. On October 8 he wrote\r\nthe following characteristic letter to General Husk:—\r\n\r\n    “A surly man came to me this evening, as he said, from you. He\r\n    would not deign to come upstairs to me, nor so much as into the\r\n    house; but stood in the yard till I came, and then obliged me\r\n    to go with him into the street, where he said, ‘You must pull\r\n    down the battlements of your house, or to-morrow the general\r\n    will pull them down for you.’\r\n\r\n    “Sir, to me this is nothing. But I humbly conceive it would\r\n    not be proper for this man, whoever he is, to behave in such a\r\n    manner to any other of his majesty’s subjects, at so critical a\r\n    time as this.\r\n\r\n    “I am ready, if it may be for his majesty’s service, to pull\r\n    not only the battlements, but the house down; or to give up any\r\n    part of it, or the whole, into your excellency’s hands.”\r\n\r\nBesides the troops already mentioned, the town had been reinforced by\r\nthe entrance of six hundred Dutch soldiers, belonging to the regiment\r\nof General de la Rocque; and gentlemen volunteers had become expert in\r\nmilitary exercise, especially the company with red and pink cockades.\r\nAll persons residing outside the walls were ordered to take their\r\nladders to the town’s yard, and their firearms to the mayor; and no\r\nperson was to fire a gun at night under pain of imprisonment. Two\r\nhundred cannon were planted on the town walls; and the water gates on\r\nthe quay side were all built up with gun holes in them.[575]\r\n\r\nWesley, supposing the danger was over for the present, started off, on\r\nOctober 9, on a short tour to Epworth, leaving John Trembath to supply\r\nhis place. At Ferrybridge he was conducted to General Wentworth, who\r\nread all the letters he had about him. At Doncaster, where he slept, or\r\nrather wished to sleep, he was surrounded by drunken, cursing, swearing\r\nsoldiers. At Epworth, he had, for once, the satisfaction of hearing\r\nMr. Romley preach “an earnest, affectionate sermon”; while he himself\r\nstrongly exhorted the society to “fear God, and honour the king.” He\r\nthen returned to Newcastle, by way of Sheffield, Birstal, Leeds, and\r\nOsmotherley, arriving on October 22, after an absence of thirteen days.\r\n\r\nWithin a week, the right honourable Fieldmarshal Wade, and Prince\r\nMaurice of Nassau, arrived with about nine thousand Dutch and English\r\nsoldiers, which, when added to General St. George’s dragoons, General\r\nSinclair’s Royal Scots, and other troops, made about fifteen thousand\r\nmen, all encamped upon Newcastle moor.[576] With such an influx, no\r\nwonder that wickedness abounded. Wesley was horrified, and on October\r\n26 sent to Mr. Ridley, the mayor, the following letter:—\r\n\r\n    “SIR,—The fear of God, the love of my country, and the regard I\r\n    have for his majesty King George, constrain me to write a few\r\n    plain words to one who is no stranger to these principles of\r\n    action.\r\n\r\n    “My soul has been pained day by day, even in walking the\r\n    streets of Newcastle, at the senseless, shameless wickedness,\r\n    the ignorant profaneness, of the poor men to whom our lives\r\n    are entrusted. The continual cursing and swearing, the wanton\r\n    blasphemy of the soldiers in general, must needs be a torture\r\n    to the sober ear, whether of a Christian or an honest infidel.\r\n    Can any that either fear God, or love their neighbour, hear\r\n    this without concern? especially if they consider the interest\r\n    of our country, as well as of these unhappy men themselves.\r\n    For can it be expected, that God should be on their side who\r\n    are daily affronting Him to His face? And if God be not on\r\n    their side, how little will either their number, or courage, or\r\n    strength avail?\r\n\r\n    “Is there no man that careth for these souls? Doubtless there\r\n    are some who ought so to do. But many of these, if I am rightly\r\n    informed, receive large pay, and do just nothing.\r\n\r\n    “I would to God it were in my power, in any degree, to supply\r\n    their lack of service. I am ready to do what in me lies, to\r\n    call these poor sinners to repentance, once or twice a day\r\n    (while I remain in these parts), at any hour, or at any place.\r\n    And I desire no pay at all for doing this; unless what my Lord\r\n    shall give at His appearing.\r\n\r\n    “If it be objected (from our heathenish poet), ‘this conscience\r\n    will make cowards of us all,’ I answer, let us judge by matter\r\n    of fact. Let either friends or enemies speak. Did those who\r\n    feared God behave as cowards at Fontenoy? Did John Haime, the\r\n    dragoon, betray any cowardice, before or after his horse sunk\r\n    under him? Or did William Clements, when he received the first\r\n    ball in his left, and the second in his right arm? Or John\r\n    Evans, when the cannon ball took off both his legs? Did he not\r\n    call all about him, as long as he could speak, to praise and\r\n    fear God, and honour the king? as one who feared nothing, but\r\n    lest his last breath should be spent in vain.\r\n\r\n    “If it were objected, that I should only fill their heads with\r\n    peculiar whims and notions; that might easily be known. Only\r\n    let the officers hear with their own ears; and they may judge\r\n    whether I do not preach the plain principles of manly, rational\r\n    religion.\r\n\r\n    “Having myself no knowledge of the general, I took the liberty\r\n    to make this offer to you. I have no interest herein; but I\r\n    should rejoice to serve, as I am able, my king and country. If\r\n    it be judged, that this will be of no real service, let the\r\n    proposal die, and be forgotten. But I beg you, sir, to believe,\r\n    that I have the same glorious cause, for which you have shown\r\n    so becoming a zeal, earnestly at heart; and that therefore, I\r\n    am, with warm respect, sir,—\r\n\r\n    Your most obedient servant,\r\n    “JOHN WESLEY.”\r\n\r\nThe mayor sent a message, to the effect that he would communicate the\r\nproposal to the general. We are not told whether the general gave his\r\nconsent or not; but, five days afterwards, we find Wesley, in the midst\r\nof this huge encampment, preaching from, “Ho, every one that thirsteth,\r\ncome ye to the waters!” “None,” says he, “attempted to make the least\r\ndisturbance, from the beginning to the end. Yet I could not reach their\r\nhearts. The words of a scholar did not affect them, like those of a\r\ndragoon or a grenadier.”\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances, Wesley honestly acknowledges, that a layman,\r\nlike John Haime, the brave dragoon, would have been more effective than\r\nhimself. This, however, did not discourage him. The day following,\r\nhe preached to the troops again. On this occasion, a lieutenant\r\nendeavoured to raise disturbance; but, when Wesley had finished, tried\r\nto make amends, by telling the soldiers that all that had been said was\r\nvery good.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Saturday, November 2, his text was, “The Scripture hath\r\nconcluded all under sin, that the promise might be given to them that\r\nbelieve;” and he now began to see some fruit of his labour. On the\r\nSunday, the camp was again his cathedral. Abundance of people flocked\r\ntogether, horse and foot, rich and poor, to whom he declared, “There\r\nis no difference; for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of\r\nGod.” He had long laid aside the German tongue, but, seeing a number\r\nof Germans standing disconsolate at the skirts of the congregation, he\r\nalso addressed them, the poor troopers drinking in every word.\r\n\r\nThis terminated his labours in the camp on Newcastle moor. The next\r\nday he set out for London, and spoiled the Guy Fawkes holiday in\r\nLeeds, by informing the magistrates that he had met several expresses,\r\nsent to countermand the march of the army into Scotland; and that\r\nthe rebels had passed the Tweed, and were marching southward. The\r\nhurry in the streets was quashed; bonfires were abandoned; and guns,\r\nsquibs, and crackers were no longer the playthings of the uproarious\r\ncrowd. Wesley proceeded on his journey, finding watchmen standing,\r\nwith great solemnity, at the end of almost every village through which\r\nhe passed. On entering Wednesbury, after it was dark, he was bogged\r\nin a quagmire; the people came with candles; and, getting out, and\r\nleaving them to disengage his horse, he hastened to Francis Ward’s,\r\nand, bedaubed with mire, at once commenced preaching. On the 13th of\r\nNovember he arrived safe in London, where he spent the rest of the\r\nyear, in preaching, and finishing his “Farther Appeal.” He gave away\r\nsome thousands of tracts among the common people; and his example was\r\nimmediately copied by others. The lord mayor ordered a large quantity\r\nof papers, dissuading from cursing and swearing, to be printed,\r\nand distributed to the trainbands; and on December 18, “An Earnest\r\nExhortation to Repentance” was given at all the church doors in London,\r\nto every person who came out, and a copy left at the house of every\r\nhouseholder who happened to be absent. “I doubt not,” says Wesley, “but\r\nGod gave a blessing therewith.”\r\n\r\nWesley’s old friend and brother-in-law, Westley Hall, was already a\r\nwaverer; and, at the end of 1745, wrote a long letter, urging the\r\ntwo Wesleys to renounce the Church of England. Wesley’s reply is too\r\nlong for insertion here; but it contains, besides other facts, some\r\nstartling high church principles, which are well worth noting. He\r\nwrites:—\r\n\r\n    “We believe it would not be right for us to administer either\r\n    baptism or the Lord’s supper, unless we had a commission so to\r\n    do from those bishops whom we apprehend to be in a succession\r\n    from the apostles.”\r\n\r\n    “We believe there is, and always was, in every Christian church\r\n    (whether dependent on the bishop of Rome or not), an outward\r\n    priesthood, ordained by Jesus Christ, and an outward sacrifice\r\n    offered therein, by men authorised to act as ambassadors of\r\n    Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.”\r\n\r\n    “We believe that the threefold order of ministers is not only\r\n    authorised by its apostolical institution, but also by the\r\n    written word.”\r\n\r\nWe must take Wesley as we find him; but is it not surprising to see him\r\nstill tenaciously clinging, even in phraseology, to the doctrine of\r\napostolical succession, and the offering of an _outward sacrifice_ in\r\nthe church, by an outward priesthood? He proceeds:—\r\n\r\n    “We allow, that many of the laws, customs, and practices of the\r\n    ecclesiastical courts are really indefensible; but we no more\r\n    look upon these filthy abuses, which adhere to our Church, as\r\n    part of the building, than we look upon any filth which may\r\n    adhere to the walls of Westminster Abbey as a part of that\r\n    structure.”\r\n\r\n    “We will obey all the laws of that Church (such as we allow\r\n    the rubrics to be, but not the customs of the ecclesiastical\r\n    courts), so far as we can with a safe conscience; and, with the\r\n    same restriction, we will obey the bishops, as executors of\r\n    those laws; but their bare will, distinct from those laws, we\r\n    do not profess to obey at all.”\r\n\r\n    “Field preaching is contrary to no law which we profess to\r\n    obey; nor are we clear, that the allowing lay preachers\r\n    is contrary to any such law. But if it is, this is one of\r\n    the exempt cases; one wherein we cannot obey with a safe\r\n    conscience.”\r\n\r\nWe have here a key to much in Wesley’s remarkable career. His doctrine\r\nof apostolical succession was a figment. His language concerning Church\r\nof England _priests_ still offering an _outward sacrifice_ savoured\r\nof the popish doctrine which all true Protestants reject, though, as\r\nwill shortly be shown, the view he held was different from what his\r\nwords express. His belief in the “threefold order of ministers” was\r\nchanged a few weeks afterwards. Field preaching and the employment of\r\nlay preachers had much to do with making Methodism; and, without a\r\ncontinuance of these, Methodism will not maintain its power and its\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nWesley’s conference, in 1745, commenced at Bristol, on the 1st of\r\nAugust, and was continued for five days following. Besides the two\r\nWesleys, there was but one clergyman, Mr. Hodges, present. There were\r\nsix itinerants: Thomas Richards, Samuel Larwood, Thomas Meyrick,\r\nRichard Moss, John Slocomb, and Herbert Jenkins; and also one\r\ngentleman, who was not a preacher at all, Marmaduke Gwynne, afterwards\r\nthe father-in-law of Wesley’s brother Charles.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the conference a principle was adopted, which ought\r\nto be practised in all similar assemblies, namely, that every one\r\nmight speak freely whatever was in his heart, and that no one should\r\nbe checked, either by word or look, even though what he was saying was\r\nentirely wrong.[577] In an assembly of equals, met for purposes of\r\ndeliberation and counsel, free speech like this is indispensable to\r\nsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\nDuring the first day of conference, the doctrine of justification was\r\nreviewed; and it was agreed, that, while faith in Christ is the sole\r\ncondition of justification, repentance, that is, conviction of sin,\r\nmust go before faith, and (supposing there be opportunity for them)\r\nfruits, or works meet for repentance, also.\r\n\r\nOn the second day, the Conference discussed the doctrines of assurance,\r\nof works done before justification, and of obedience. It was agreed\r\nneither to discourage nor encourage dreams, though it was admitted,\r\nthat, by such means, saving faith is often given. On the subject of\r\nsanctification, it was laid down, that inward sanctification begins\r\nin the moment we are justified; that, from that time, the believer\r\ngradually dies to sin, and grows in grace; and that the seed of all\r\nsin remains in him, till he is sanctified throughout, in spirit, soul,\r\nand body. This entire sanctification is not ordinarily given till a\r\nlittle before death; but we ought to expect it sooner; for, though\r\nthe generality of believers are not sanctified till near death, and\r\nthough few of those to whom St. Paul wrote his epistles were so at the\r\ntime he wrote, and though he himself was not sanctified at the time of\r\nwriting his former epistles, this does not prove that we may not be\r\nsanctified to-day. It was further agreed, that sanctification should\r\nscarcely be preached at all to those who were not pressing forward; and\r\nwhen it was, it should always be by way of promise,—by drawing, rather\r\nthan by driving. And, further, it was determined, that the _general_\r\nmeans which God has ordained for our receiving His sanctifying grace\r\nare keeping all His commandments, denying ourselves, and taking up\r\nour cross daily; and, that the _particular_ are prayer, searching the\r\nScriptures, communicating, and fasting.\r\n\r\nThe Methodist reader will find something here hardly in harmony with\r\nthe decisions of the previous Conference, and with Wesley’s subsequent\r\nteaching. Twenty years after this, in answer to the question, “What\r\nshall we do, that this work of God may be wrought in us?” Wesley said:—\r\n\r\n    “In this, as in all other instances, ‘by grace we are saved\r\n    through faith,’ Sanctification too is ‘not of works, lest\r\n    any man should boast,’ ‘It is the gift of God,’ and is to be\r\n    received by plain, simple faith. Suppose you are now labouring\r\n    to abstain from all appearance of evil, zealous of good works,\r\n    and walking diligently and carefully in all the ordinances\r\n    of God; there is then only one point remaining: the voice of\r\n    God to your soul is, ‘Believe, and be saved,’ First, believe\r\n    that God has _promised_ to save you from all sin, and to fill\r\n    you with all holiness. Secondly, believe that He is _able_\r\n    thus to save to the uttermost all that come unto God through\r\n    Him. Thirdly, believe that He is _willing_ as well as able.\r\n    Fourthly, believe that He is not only able, but willing to do\r\n    it _now_! Not when you come to die, not at any distant time,\r\n    not to-morrow, but to-day. He will then enable you to believe,\r\n    _it is done_, according to His word; and then ‘patience shall\r\n    have its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,\r\n    wanting nothing.’”[578]\r\n\r\nAt the third day’s session, the Conference debated points of church\r\ngovernment. The question was asked, “Is episcopal, presbyterian, or\r\nindependent church government most agreeable to reason?” The answer\r\ngiven was, that each is a development of the other. A preacher\r\npreaches, and forms an _independent_ congregation; he then forms\r\nanother and another in the immediate vicinity of the first; this\r\nobliges him to appoint _deacons_, who look on the first pastor as\r\ntheir common father; and as these congregations increase, and as their\r\n_deacons_ grow in years and grace, they need other subordinate deacons,\r\nor helpers; in respect of whom they are called _presbyters_, or elders;\r\nas their father in the Lord may be called the _bishop_, or overseer of\r\nthem all. To say the least, this solution is ingenious.\r\n\r\nWith reference to Wesley’s assistants, fourteen in number, it was\r\nresolved, that they had nothing to do but to save souls; and that, in\r\nprosecuting this, they should, besides preaching every morning and\r\nevery night, spend from six o’clock till twelve every day in reading,\r\nwriting, and prayer; from twelve to five in visiting; and from five to\r\nsix in private communion with God.\r\n\r\nIt was also determined what books should constitute the libraries for\r\nWesley’s own use, at London, Bristol, and Newcastle,—namely, eleven on\r\ndivinity; four on physic; two on natural philosophy; one (Whiston) on\r\nastronomy; one (the Universal) on history; two (Spenser and Milton) in\r\npoetry; sixteen in Latin; twelve in Greek; and one (Buxtorf’s Bible) in\r\nHebrew.\r\n\r\nWhile Wesley was thus conferring with his lay itinerants, he was,\r\nunconsciously, corresponding with a man, who soon became the highest\r\ndignitary in the Established Church.\r\n\r\nThomas Secker was six years the senior of Wesley. His father was a\r\nDissenter, and he himself was designed for the Dissenting ministry.\r\nScruples of conscience prevented this, and young Secker resolved to\r\nqualify himself for the practice of physic. At Leyden, he took the\r\ndegree of M.D.; but, on returning to England, in 1721, he entered\r\nhimself a gentleman commoner at Exeter College, Oxford; and, in the\r\nyear following, was ordained a deacon of the Church of England. In\r\n1724, he became rector of the valuable living of Houghton-le-spring;\r\nand, in 1725, married Bishop Benson’s sister. In 1733, he obtained the\r\nrectory of St. James’s; and, the year after, was raised to the see of\r\nBristol. In 1737, he was translated to the diocese of Oxford; and, in\r\n1758, was advanced to the primacy.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, 1745, this distinguished man commenced a long,\r\ntemperate, and able correspondence with Wesley, under the _alias_ of\r\nJohn Smith. The correspondence was continued for nearly three years,\r\nand was first published by Mr. Moore, in his Life of Wesley, in 1825.\r\nSpace forbids even an epitome of these able letters. They are full of\r\ninterest, intelligence, and piety; and do honour to the head and heart\r\nof both the archbishop and the clerical itinerant.\r\n\r\nThe only thing which remains, before leaving the year 1745, is to\r\nnotice Wesley’s publications. His answer to Church; his Dialogues\r\non Antinomianism; and his Short View of the Difference between the\r\nMoravians and himself, have been already mentioned. The rest were\r\npartly original, and partly abridgments from the works of others.\r\n\r\n1. “Thoughts concerning the present Revival of Religion in New England.\r\nBy Jonathan Edwards. Abridged by John Wesley.” 12mo, 124 pages. This\r\ndeeply interesting work was first published at Boston, in America, in a\r\nvolume of more than two hundred pages, and has been referred to already\r\nin a previous chapter of the present book.\r\n\r\n2. “An Extract of Mr. Richard Baxter’s Aphorisms on Justification.”\r\n12mo, 36 pages. The pamphlet is divided into forty-five propositions,\r\nand, like all Baxter’s works, is full of Scripture truth, and well\r\nworth reading.\r\n\r\n3. “Hymns on the Lord’s Supper; by John and Charles Wesley. With a\r\npreface concerning the Christian Sacrament and Sacrifice. Extracted\r\nfrom Dr. Brevint. By John Wesley.” 12mo, 166 pages. The hymns are\r\na hundred and sixty-six in number, and are distinguished by great\r\nvariety of thought and language. Several of the best are published\r\nin the Methodist Hymn-book. An extract from Brevint, which, by\r\npublishing, Wesley made his own, will help to explain his meaning in\r\nthe objectionable phraseology he employed in his letter to Westley Hall.\r\n\r\n    “The Lord’s supper was chiefly ordained for a sacrament:—1. To\r\n    _represent_ the sufferings of Christ which are _past_, whereof\r\n    it is a _memorial_. 2. To _convey_ the first fruits of these\r\n    sufferings, in _present graces_, whereof it is a _means_. 3.\r\n    To _assure_ us of _glory to come_, whereof it is an infallible\r\n    _pledge_.”\r\n\r\n    “The sacrifice, which by a _real_ oblation was not to\r\n    be offered more than once, is, by a devout and thankful\r\n    commemoration, to be offered up every day. The _sacrifice_ in\r\n    itself can never be repeated. Nevertheless, this sacrament,\r\n    by our remembrance, becomes a _kind of sacrifice_, whereby we\r\n    present before God the Father that precious oblation of His\r\n    Son once offered. To _men_, the holy communion is a _sacred\r\n    table_, where God’s minister is ordered to represent, from God\r\n    his Master, the passion of His dear Son, as still fresh, and\r\n    still powerful for their eternal salvation. And to _God_, it\r\n    is an _altar_, whereon men mystically present to Him the same\r\n    sacrifice, as still bleeding and sueing for mercy.”\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Wesley’s publications, in 1745, were original: namely:—\r\n\r\n1. “An Earnest Persuasive to keep the Sabbath holy.” Four pages, 12mo.\r\nThis was afterwards reprinted as “A Word to a Sabbath-breaker.”\r\n\r\nSabbath breaking, in the days of Wesley, was one of the crying sins\r\nof England. “How many are they,” he wrote, “in every city, as well as\r\nin this, who profane the sabbath with a high hand! How many in this,\r\nthat openly defy God and the king, that break the laws, both Divine and\r\nhuman, by working at their trade, delivering their goods, receiving\r\ntheir pay, or following their ordinary business, in one branch or\r\nanother, and ‘wiping their mouths and saying, I do no evil!’ How many\r\nbuy and sell on the day of the Lord, even in the open streets of this\r\ncity? How many open, or (with some modesty) half open their shops?\r\neven when they have not the pretence of perishable goods; without any\r\npretence at all: money is their god, and gain their godliness. What\r\nalso are all these droves in the skirts of the town, that well-nigh\r\ncover the face of the earth? till they drop one after another into the\r\nnumerous receptacles prepared for them in every corner. They drink\r\nin iniquity like water. A whole army joins together, and, with one\r\nconsent, in the face of the sun, runs upon the thick bosses of God’s\r\nbuckler.”[579]\r\n\r\nThis, written in 1745, is too true a picture of the state of things\r\nat the present day. Wesley regarded national depravity as turning\r\nchiefly on the two hinges of sabbath profanation, and the neglect of\r\nthe education of children. Till some way was found of stopping these\r\ngreat inlets of wickedness, he had no hope of a general reformation.\r\n“The religious observance of the sabbath,” he writes, “is the best\r\npreservative of virtue and religion, and the neglect and profanation\r\nof it is the greatest inlet to vice and wickedness.”[580] Holding such\r\nviews, no wonder that he published the pointed, pithy tract to which we\r\nare now adverting.\r\n\r\n2. “Swear not at all, saith the Lord God of Heaven and Earth.” Four\r\npages, 12mo. This also was reprinted as “A Word to a Swearer.” Like\r\nall Wesley’s tracts, it is a model well worthy of imitation. Profane\r\nswearing was another of the senseless, stupid, shameless sins of the\r\nperiod in which Wesley lived. In another of his publications, issued in\r\n1745, he asks: “In what city or town, in what market or exchange, in\r\nwhat street or place of public resort, is not the name of God taken in\r\nvain, day by day? From the noble to the peasant, who fails to call upon\r\nGod in this, if in no other way? Whither can you turn, where can you\r\ngo, without hearing some praying to God for damnation, either on his\r\nneighbour or himself? cursing those, without either fear or remorse,\r\nwhom Christ hath bought to inherit a blessing!”[581]\r\n\r\n3. “A Word in Season; or, Advice to an Englishman.” Twelve pages, 12mo.\r\nThis was published at the beginning of the rebellion, and shows what\r\nwould be the dreadful results if the Pretender should become king of\r\nEngland by conquest. Popery would be established, and property would\r\nbe confiscated. “Who can doubt,” he asks, “but one who should conquer\r\nEngland, by the assistance of France, would copy after the French rules\r\nof government?” He continues:—\r\n\r\n    “How dreadful then is the condition wherein we stand! On\r\n    the very brink of utter destruction! But why are we thus?\r\n    I am afraid the answer is too plain, to every considerate\r\n    man. Because of our sins; because we have well-nigh filled\r\n    up the measure of our iniquities. For what wickedness is\r\n    there under heaven, which is not found among us at this day?\r\n    Not to insist on sabbath breaking, thefts, cheating, fraud,\r\n    extortion, violence, oppression, lying, robberies, sodomies\r\n    and murders, which with a thousand unnamed villainies are\r\n    common to us and our neighbour Christians of Holland, France,\r\n    and Germany,—what a plentiful harvest we have of wickedness\r\n    almost peculiar to ourselves! For who can _vie with us_ in the\r\n    direction of courts of _justice_? In the management of public\r\n    _charities_? Or in the _accomplished_, barefaced wickedness,\r\n    which so abounds in our _prisons_, and _fleets_, and _armies_?\r\n    Who in _Europe_ can compare with the _sloth_, _laziness_,\r\n    _luxury_, and _effeminacy_ of the _English gentry_? Or with the\r\n    _drunkenness_, and stupid, senseless _cursing_ and _swearing_,\r\n    which are daily seen and heard in our streets? Add to all\r\n    these that open and professed _Deism_ and _rejection_ of the\r\n    gospel,—that _public_, _avowed_ apostasy from the Christian\r\n    faith, which reigns among the rich and great, and hath spread\r\n    from _them_ to _all_ ranks and orders of men, and made us a\r\n    people fitted for the _destroyer of the gentiles_.”\r\n\r\nThis, under the circumstances then existing, was bold writing; but\r\nWesley was a bold man, and never shunned what he conceived to be his\r\nduty because it was difficult and dangerous.\r\n\r\n4. “A Word to a Drunkard.” Four pages, 12mo. The following are the\r\nopening sentences:—\r\n\r\n    “Are _you_ a man? God made you a _man_; but you make yourself a\r\n    _beast_. Wherein does a _man_ differ from a _beast_? Is it not\r\n    chiefly in _reason and understanding_? But you throw away what\r\n    _reason_ you have. You strip yourself of your _understanding_.\r\n    You do all you can to make yourself a mere _beast_; not a\r\n    fool, not a madman only; but a _swine_, a poor filthy swine.\r\n    Go and wallow with them in the mire! Go, drink on, till thy\r\n    nakedness be uncovered, and shameful spewing be on thy glory!\r\n    O how honourable is a _beast_ of God’s making, compared to one\r\n    who makes himself a _beast_! But that is not all. You make\r\n    yourself a _devil_. You stir up all the devilish tempers that\r\n    are in you, and gain others which perhaps were not in you. You\r\n    cause the fire of anger, or malice, or lust to burn seven times\r\n    hotter than before.”\r\n\r\n5. It was also about this period, that Wesley wrote and published his\r\nsmall tract (12mo, four pages), entitled, “A Word to an Unhappy Woman.”\r\n\r\n6. “Advice to the People called Methodists.” Twelve pages, 12mo. The\r\nadvices are five in number:—1. To consider, with deep and frequent\r\nattention, the peculiar circumstances in which they stood; for their\r\nname, their principles, and their strictness of life were _new_.\r\nThey were _newly united_ together,—a poor, low, and insignificant\r\npeople,—most even of their teachers being quite unlearned men. 2. Not\r\nto imagine that they could avoid giving offence. 3. To consider deeply\r\nwith themselves, is the God whom we serve able to deliver us? 4. To be\r\ntrue to their principles. 5. Not to talk much of what they suffered.\r\n\r\n7. Wesley’s last and most important publication was, “A Farther Appeal\r\nto men of Reason and Religion.” 12mo, 106 pages.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he gives a summary of the doctrines he teaches. He then\r\nproceeds to meet the objection, that justification by faith alone is\r\nnot a scriptural doctrine, nor the doctrine of the Church of England.\r\nHe next replies to the accusations of the Bishop of London, in his\r\npamphlet, entitled, “Observations upon the Conduct and Behaviour of\r\nthe Methodists,” which had been sent to every clergyman in the London\r\ndiocese. Whitefield had already published an answer to this episcopal\r\nproduction, in two letters, addressed “to the right reverend the\r\nBishop of London, and the other right reverend the bishops concerned\r\nin the publication thereof;” and now Wesley undertakes the same\r\nformidable task,—David against Goliath,—an outcast priest against a\r\nwhole bench of bishops. Wesley dissects the prelate’s pamphlet, and,\r\nwith a master’s brevity, refutes it bit by bit. He then replies to a\r\nsimilar production, which has been already noticed, “The Notions of the\r\nMethodists Disproved;” and after that proceeds to answer the “charge,”\r\nlately published by the Lord Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, Dr.\r\nSmalbroke, a man of some ability, but not over skilled in logic,\r\nwho, in one of his best productions, “A Vindication of our Saviour’s\r\nMiracles,” showed his weakness by calculating the precise number of\r\ndevils in the herd of Gadarenish swine. Wesley writes:—\r\n\r\n    “I conceive, not only, that your lordship has _proved_ nothing\r\n    hitherto; but that, strictly speaking, you have not _attempted\r\n    to prove_ anything, having _taken for granted_ whatever came\r\n    in your way. What is become of your demonstration? Leave\r\n    it to the carmen and porters, its just proprietors; to the\r\n    zealous apple-women, that cry after me in the street, ‘This is\r\n    he that rails at the _Whole Dutyful_ of man.’ But let every\r\n    one that pretends to learning or reason be ashamed to mention\r\n    it any more. O my lord, whom have you represented as rank,\r\n    dreaming enthusiasts? as either deluded or designing men?\r\n    Not only Bishop Pearson, a man hitherto accounted both sound\r\n    in heart, and of good understanding; but likewise Archbishop\r\n    Cranmer, Bishop Ridley, Bishop Latimer, Bishop Hooper; and all\r\n    the venerable compilers of our liturgy and homilies: all the\r\n    members of both the houses of convocation, by whom they were\r\n    revised and approved: yea, King Edward, and all his lords and\r\n    commons together, by whose authority they were established!\r\n    And, with these _modern enthusiasts_, Origen, Chrysostom, and\r\n    Athanasius are comprehended in the same censure.”\r\n\r\nWesley’s object in this important treatise may be gathered from its\r\nconcluding paragraph:—\r\n\r\n    “I have now answered most of the current objections,\r\n    particularly such as have appeared of weight to religious or\r\n    reasonable men. I have endeavoured to show, first, that the\r\n    _doctrines_ I teach are no other than the great truths of the\r\n    gospel. Secondly, that though I teach them not as I _would_,\r\n    but as I _can_, yet it is in a _manner_ not contrary to law.\r\n    And thirdly, that the _effects_ of thus preaching the gospel\r\n    have not been such as was weakly or wickedly reported,—these\r\n    reports being mere artifices of the devil, to hinder the work\r\n    of God.”\r\n\r\nUp to the present, most of Wesley’s publications were small and cheap;\r\nbut they had an immense circulation, and not only paid expenses, but\r\nleft a profit. In a sermon, written in the year 1780, he naively\r\nremarks: “Two-and-forty years ago, having a desire to furnish poor\r\npeople with cheaper, shorter, and plainer books, than any I had seen,\r\nI wrote many small tracts, generally a penny apiece; and afterwards\r\nseveral larger. Some of these had such a sale as I never thought of;\r\nand, by this means, I unawares became rich. But I never desired or\r\nendeavoured after it. And now that it is come upon me unawares, I lay\r\nup no treasures upon earth; I lay up nothing at all. I cannot help\r\nleaving my books behind me whenever God calls me hence; but, in every\r\nother respect, my own hands will be my executors.”[582]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1746.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1746 Age 43]\r\n\r\nWhitefield and his wife spent the whole of the year 1746 in America. “I\r\nlove,” said he, “to range in the American woods, and sometimes think\r\nI shall never return to England any more.”[583] Writing to Wesley, in\r\nOctober, he remarks:—\r\n\r\n    “The regard I have always had for you and your brother,\r\n    is still as great as ever; and I trust we shall give this\r\n    and future ages an example of true Christian love abiding,\r\n    notwithstanding difference in judgment. Why our Lord has\r\n    permitted us to differ as to some points of doctrine, will\r\n    be discovered at the last day. I have had the pleasure of\r\n    reading the continuance of your Appeal; and pray, that God\r\n    would prosper every labour of your pen and lip. I find that\r\n    antinomianism has been springing up in many places. I bless\r\n    God, you have made a stand against it. If you ask, how it is\r\n    with me, I answer, happy in Jesus, the Lord my righteousness.\r\n    If you ask, what I am doing,—ranging and hunting in the\r\n    American woods after poor sinners. If you ask, with what\r\n    success,—my labours were never more acceptable; and the door,\r\n    for fifteen hundred miles together, is quite open for preaching\r\n    the everlasting gospel. In Maryland and Virginia, people fly\r\n    to hear the word like doves to the windows. Congregations are\r\n    large, and the work is going on, just as it began and went on\r\n    in England. Notwithstanding the declining state of Georgia, the\r\n    orphan house is in a better situation than ever; and, in a year\r\n    or two, I trust it will support itself. Several of the great\r\n    and rich favour the Redeemer’s cause, and many of my professed\r\n    enemies are made to be at peace with me. O reverend and dear,\r\n    and very dear sir, be pleased to continue to pray for me, your\r\n    most affectionate, though unworthy, younger brother and servant\r\n    in Jesus Christ,\r\n\r\n    “GEORGE WHITEFIELD.”[584]\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley spent more than four months in London and its vicinity;\r\nabout six in Bristol, in Cornwall, and in the west of England; and\r\nthe last weeks of the year in a tour to Yorkshire and Newcastle. Like\r\na flaming seraph, his soul glowed with sacred love and music; and no\r\ntoil, danger, or persecution was too great to be encountered for\r\nhis Saviour. In Cornwall, it was rumoured, that he had brought the\r\nPretender with him; and the famous Mr. Eustick came with a warrant to\r\napprehend him: but, as usual, at the last moment, Eustick’s courage\r\nfailed him. At Shoreham, as soon as he commenced the service, the wild\r\nrabble “began roaring, stamping, blaspheming, ringing the bells, and\r\nturning the church into a bear garden.” At Hexham, while preaching in a\r\ncockpit, Squire Roberts did his utmost to raise a mob; and two butlers,\r\nin the employ of two magistrates, brought their cocks, and set them\r\nfighting. In the midst of all, Charles was jubilant, and expressed the\r\ngratitude of his heart in the following thanksgiving:—\r\n\r\n            “All thanks be to God,\r\n            Who scatters abroad,\r\n            Throughout every place,\r\n    By the least of His servants, His savour of grace:\r\n            Who the victory gave,\r\n            The praise let Him have,\r\n            For the work He hath done;\r\n    All honour and glory to Jesus alone!”[585]\r\n\r\nEqual zeal and heroism characterized Wesley’s helpers. At Nottingham,\r\nthe mob surrounded the meeting-house, and threatened to pull it down.\r\nJohn Nelson was seized by the constable for creating the riot, and was\r\ntaken to an alderman, the crowd following him with curses and huzzas.\r\nThe alderman asked his name, and said: “I wonder you cannot stay at\r\nhome; you see the mob won’t suffer you to preach in Nottingham.” John\r\nreplied, that he was not aware that Nottingham was governed by a mob,\r\nmost towns being governed by the magistrates; and then proceeded “to\r\nset life and death before him.” “Don’t preach here,” said the alderman;\r\nwhile the constable began to be uneasy, and asked how he was to dispose\r\nof his prisoner. “Take him to your house,” quoth the alderman. The\r\nconstable desired to be excused; and, at length, was directed to\r\nconduct Nelson back to the place from which he had brought him, and to\r\nbe careful he was not injured. “So,” says honest John, “he brought me\r\nto our brethren again; and left us to give thanks to God for all His\r\nmercies.”\r\n\r\nWesley began the year 1746 by preaching in London at four o’clock in\r\nthe morning, a thing not often done by his successors.\r\n\r\nOn January 20, he set out for Bristol, and on the road read a book\r\nwhich greatly moulded his future character and course. Lord King was\r\nthe son of a grocer at Exeter, and the nephew of the celebrated Locke,\r\nwho left him half his library. At the age of twenty-two, in 1691, he\r\npublished, “An Inquiry into the Constitution, Discipline, Unity, and\r\nWorship of the Primitive Church, that flourished three hundred years\r\nafter Christ; faithfully collected out of the extant writings of those\r\nages.” King was a rigid Dissenter; and the chief object of his learned\r\nwork was to prepare the way for that comprehension of the Dissenters\r\nwithin the pale of the Established Church, which the Revolution of 1688\r\nwas supposed likely to accomplish. After this, he rose to be Lord High\r\nChancellor of England, and died in 1734, leaving behind him a character\r\nof great virtue and humanity, and of steady attachment to civil and\r\nreligious liberty.\r\n\r\nThe above book by Lord King was Wesley’s companion on his way to\r\nBristol; and, after reading it, he wrote: “In spite of the vehement\r\nprejudice of my education, I was ready to believe that this was a fair\r\nand impartial draught; but, if so, it would follow, that bishops and\r\npresbyters are essentially of one order, and that, originally, every\r\nChristian congregation was a church independent of all others.”\r\n\r\nThus, notwithstanding his strong affection for the Church of England,\r\nwe find Wesley, almost at the commencement of his Methodist career,\r\nentertaining doubts respecting its ecclesiastical polity. The recorded\r\ndecisions of the Conference of 1745 plainly show, that he regarded his\r\npreachers as deacons, and presbyters, and thought himself a scriptural\r\nbishop. Lord King’s researches served to confirm these sentiments. In\r\nthe minutes of the conference held a year after this (1747), we find\r\nthe following questions and answers:—\r\n\r\n    “_Q._ Does a church in the New Testament always mean a single\r\n    congregation?\r\n\r\n    “_A._ We believe it does. We do not recollect any instance to\r\n    the contrary.\r\n\r\n    “_Q._ What instance or ground is there then in the New\r\n    Testament for a _national_ church?\r\n\r\n    “_A._ We know none at all. We apprehend it to be a merely\r\n    political institution.\r\n\r\n    “_Q._ Are the three orders of bishops, priests, and deacons\r\n    plainly described in the New Testament?\r\n\r\n    “_A._ We think they are; and believe they generally obtained in\r\n    the churches of the apostolic age.\r\n\r\n    “_Q._ But are you assured, that God designed the same plan\r\n    should obtain in all churches, throughout all ages?\r\n\r\n    “_A._ We are not assured of this; because we do not know that\r\n    it is asserted in Holy Writ.\r\n\r\n    “_Q._ If this plan were essential to a Christian church, what\r\n    must become of all the foreign reformed churches?\r\n\r\n    “_A._ It would follow, that they are no parts of the church of\r\n    Christ! A consequence full of shocking absurdity.\r\n\r\n    “_Q._ In what age was the Divine right of episcopacy first\r\n    asserted in England?\r\n\r\n    “_A._ About the middle of Queen Elizabeth’s reign. Till then\r\n    all the bishops and clergy in England continually allowed, and\r\n    joined in, the ministrations of those who were not episcopally\r\n    ordained.\r\n\r\n    “_Q._ Must there not be numberless accidental varieties in the\r\n    government of various churches?\r\n\r\n    “_A._ There must, in the nature of things. For, as God\r\n    variously dispenses His gifts of nature, providence, and grace,\r\n    both the offices themselves and the officers in each ought to\r\n    be varied from time to time.\r\n\r\n    “_Q._ Why is it, that there is no determinate plan of church\r\n    government appointed in Scripture?\r\n\r\n    “_A._ Without doubt, because the wisdom of God had a regard to\r\n    this necessary variety.\r\n\r\n    “_Q._ Was there any thought of uniformity in the government of\r\n    all churches, until the time of Constantine?\r\n\r\n    “_A._ It is certain there was not; and would not have been\r\n    then, had men consulted the word of God only.”[586]\r\n\r\nThis is an important extract. Wesley loved the Church of England; but\r\nwho will say, that the views of Wesley were now identical with those\r\nof the high church bigots of either past or present days! Their views\r\nhad been his; but he now renounced them. Lord King, the Dissenter, had\r\nconverted him. His principles, respecting ecclesiastical polity, were\r\nchanged. After this, we have no more nonsense concerning apostolical\r\nsuccession. Indeed, in reference to this, Wesley wrote (in 1761): “I\r\nnever could see it proved; and I am persuaded I never shall.”[587]\r\nIt is not too much to say, that, from the time of reading the book\r\nof Lord King, Wesley’s principles of ecclesiastical polity were\r\nsubstantially the same as those of Dissenters. He still preferred\r\nthe Church of England, not because he thought it the only church,\r\nbut because, upon the whole, he thought it the best. In the above\r\nextract, we have the principles deliberately adopted, which laid the\r\ngroundwork of his future proceedings. As a presbyter, in other words\r\na bishop, he employed preachers, and set them apart to the sacred\r\noffice. It is true, that it was not until nearly forty years after\r\nthis, that he began to use the imposition of hands; but that was a\r\nmere _circumstance_, not the _essence_ of ministerial ordination. Mr.\r\nWatson properly observes: “It has been generally supposed, that Mr.\r\nWesley did not consider his appointment of preachers as an _ordination_\r\nto the ministry; but only as an irregular employment of laymen in the\r\nspiritual office of merely expounding the Scriptures in a case of moral\r\nnecessity. This is not correct. They were not appointed to expound or\r\npreach merely, but were solemnly set apart to the pastoral office; nor\r\nwere they regarded by him as _laymen_, except when in common parlance\r\nthey were distinguished from the clergy of the Church.”[588] His usual\r\nmode of _setting apart or ordaining_ to the ministry consisted of\r\na most rigid examination of the ministerial candidate on the three\r\npoints—Has he grace? Has he gifts? Has he fruit? preceded by fasting\r\nand prayer; and followed by official and authoritative appointment\r\nto ministerial work. For the present, the form of laying on of hands\r\nwas not employed; but it was thought of, and was discussed. Hence the\r\nfollowing extract from the minutes of the conference held in 1746:—\r\n\r\n    “_Q._ Why do we not use more form and solemnity in receiving a\r\n    new labourer?\r\n\r\n    “_A._ We purposely decline it—(1) Because, there is something\r\n    of stateliness in it. (2) Because, we would not make haste. We\r\n    desire barely to follow Providence, as it gradually opens.”\r\n\r\nIt is granted that, for Wesley, after this, to fight so tenaciously for\r\nthe Church of England was inconsistent, but we take him as we find him.\r\nFacts are facts; and we shall not attempt to blink them. Having founded\r\nchurches, or societies as he persisted in calling them, he proceeded to\r\nprovide and to _ordain_,—yes, to _ordain_ for them ministers. He was\r\na clergyman of the episcopal Church of England, with the views of a\r\nDissenter, and, acting accordingly, there was, of course, in his future\r\nproceedings, much that was incongruous and perplexing.\r\n\r\nWesley left London for Bristol, on January 20. Two days afterwards,\r\nhe attended, in the latter city, a conference of the Calvinistic\r\nMethodists, at which there were present Howel Harris and eleven of\r\nhis preachers, and Wesley and four of his. Wesley seems to have been\r\npresident; at all events, his name stands first. The following are the\r\nminutes:—\r\n\r\n    “After prayer it was inquired:—(1) How we may remove any\r\n    hindrances of brotherly love which have occurred. (2) How we\r\n    may prevent any arising hereafter. It was feared that, in\r\n    consequence of Mr. Wesley’s preaching in Neath, there would be\r\n    a separation in the society. He answered, ‘I do not design to\r\n    erect a society at Neath, or any town in Wales, where there is\r\n    a society already, but to do all that in me lieth to prevent\r\n    any such separation.’\r\n\r\n    “We all agreed that, if we occasionally preached among each\r\n    other’s people, we should endeavour to strengthen and not to\r\n    weaken each other’s hands, and prevent any separation in the\r\n    several societies; and that a brother from Wesley’s society\r\n    should go with Harris to Plymouth and the west, to heal the\r\n    breach there made, and to insist on a spirit of love and its\r\n    fruits among the people. Agreed, that we should, on each side,\r\n    be careful to defend each other’s characters.”[589]\r\n\r\nThis is beautiful, and sets an example worthy of being emulated by the\r\nMethodist Conferences of the present day. It was but five or six years\r\nsince the Methodist schism had happened; and yet, under the magnanimous\r\nmanagement of Wesley and Howel Harris, here we find the two parties\r\nmet, not to fight, but to love each other. Differences are kept up\r\nand perpetuated, not by greatness and goodness, but by despicable\r\nignorance and selfish meanness. Why should Ephraim envy Judah, and\r\nJudah vex Ephraim? The two are brothers; and, as brethren, it would be\r\na goodly and pleasant sight to see them _dwelling together_ in unity.\r\n\r\nWesley spent a month in Bristol and the neighbourhood; during which\r\nperiod his brother Charles opened a chapel at Wapping;[590] and Wesley\r\nhimself received the following cautionary letter from a new clerical\r\nacquaintance, and, ever afterwards, most confidential and trustworthy\r\nfriend. Vincent Perronet was now vicar of Shoreham, in the county of\r\nKent. A year and a half before, Wesley and Perronet had been brought\r\ntogether by their mutual friend, the Rev. Henry Piers. Wesley writes:\r\n“I hope to have cause of blessing God for ever for the acquaintance\r\nbegun this day.” The hope was realised. Wesley had no more faithful\r\nfriend than Vincent Perronet, who now wrote as follows:—\r\n\r\n    _“February 7, 1746._\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR FRIEND,—I make no apology for this trouble, because\r\n    I know that you will think it needs none. God hath raised you\r\n    up to propagate His spiritual kingdom in the hearts of men;\r\n    therefore, be careful how you frustrate this great design of\r\n    God. But will you not do this, if you injure your health? Or\r\n    can you labour in the vineyard of Christ, when your strength is\r\n    gone? Deny yourself, my dear friend, so far as is consistent\r\n    with your constant labour; but be cautious lest your self\r\n    denials should rob God or His children of what you have\r\n    undertaken for the service of both. Remember, that, if you\r\n    weaken your body by over mortifications, you render yourself so\r\n    far incapable of promoting the honour of the former, and the\r\n    happiness of the latter; and yet I know that each of these is\r\n    dearer to you than life itself. Let the Holy Spirit’s advice,\r\n    out of the mouth of a mortified apostle, to the abstemious\r\n    Timothy, be constantly before you.\r\n\r\n    “I am, with great sincerity, my dear brother in Christ, your\r\n    most affectionate\r\n\r\n    VINCENT PERRONET.”[591]\r\n\r\nAt this period, advice like this, in Wesley’s case, was not unneeded.\r\n\r\nOn February 17, when days were short and weather far from favourable,\r\nhe set out, on horseback, from Bristol to Newcastle, a distance of\r\nbetween three and four hundred miles. The journey occupied ten weary\r\ndays. Brooks were swollen, and, in some places, the roads were\r\nimpassable, obliging the itinerant to go round about through fields.\r\nAt Aldridge Heath, in Staffordshire, the rain turned into snow, which\r\nthe northerly wind drove against him, and by which he was soon crusted\r\nover from head to foot. At Leeds, the mob followed him, and pelted him\r\nwith whatever came to hand. Several of the missiles struck him, some on\r\nthe face, but none seriously hurt him. At Skircoat Green, he preached\r\nto a congregation of Quakers; and at Keighley, found the snow so deep,\r\nthat he was obliged to abandon his intention of travelling through the\r\ndales. He arrived at Newcastle on February 26.\r\n\r\nHere he found general sickness. Two thousand of the soldiers,\r\nbelonging to the encampment on the town moor, were already dead, and\r\nthe fever was still sweeping others away in troops. In Newcastle and\r\nits neighbourhood, he spent the next eighteen days, preaching, on one\r\noccasion, at Placey, out of doors, in the midst of a “vehement storm,”\r\nwhich, however, the preacher and his “congregation regarded not.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was here, a letter was published in the _London Magazine_,\r\naddressed “to the Rev. Mr. John Wesley, in relation to some false\r\nfacts affirmed by him in his Farther Appeal.” A passage was quoted\r\nin reference to the clergy putting no difference between the holy\r\nand profane at the sacramental table; and it was declared, that the\r\nquotation “contains almost as many falsehoods as it does lines.” Wesley\r\nis further accused of “gross misrepresentations and uncharitable\r\nreflections”; of being “base, unjust, and senseless”; of “crowding a\r\nheap of untruths into a little room”; of being animated by “a blind and\r\nrash zeal, and glad to catch at every pretence of making God the patron\r\nand favourer of his cause.”\r\n\r\nA production so bitterly scurrilous scarcely deserved an answer; but,\r\nas Wesley was slightly in error, he, like an honest man, frankly\r\nconfessed it. The following is his reply, published in the same\r\nperiodical.\r\n\r\n    “_June 18, 1746._\r\n\r\n    “SIR,—I delayed answering your letter of March 18, till I could\r\n    be fully informed of the facts in question.\r\n\r\n    “I said in the Farther Appeal, page 48, ‘Who dares repel one\r\n    of the greatest men in his parish from the Lord’s table, even\r\n    though he openly deny the Lord that bought him? Mr. Stonehouse\r\n    did this once; but what was the event? The gentleman brought an\r\n    action against him. And who was able and willing to espouse his\r\n    cause? He alone who took it into His own hands; and, before the\r\n    day when it should have been tried here, caused the plaintiff\r\n    to answer at a higher bar.’\r\n\r\n    “You (1) blame me for supposing that gentleman to be one who\r\n    openly denied the Lord that bought him; I mean, openly denied\r\n    the supreme Godhead of Christ. If he did not, I retract the\r\n    charge.\r\n\r\n    “You say (2) that gentleman brought no action, nor commenced\r\n    any suit against Mr. Stonehouse. Upon stricter inquiry, I find\r\n    he did not; it was another gentleman, Mr. C—p—r.\r\n\r\n    “You (3) observe, it was not the death of the plaintiff which\r\n    stopped the action; but before it proceeded to a trial, Mr.\r\n    Stonehouse thought fit to request it as a favour, that the\r\n    action might be stopped, promising not to do the like any more.\r\n    Mr. Stonehouse himself gives a different account; but whether\r\n    his or yours be the more just, is not material, since the\r\n    substance of what you observe is true, namely, ‘That it was not\r\n    the plaintiff’s death which stopped the action.’\r\n\r\n    “You add, ‘I would willingly hope, that you did not\r\n    deliberately design to impose upon the world.’ I did not; and\r\n    do, therefore, acknowledge the truth in as public a manner as\r\n    I am able, being willing, as far as in me lies, to make amends\r\n    for whatever injury I have done.\r\n\r\n    “I am, sir, yours,\r\n    “JOHN WESLEY.”\r\n\r\nIn the same month of March, another letter, of a different complexion,\r\nwas published in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_. The writer begins by\r\nshowing, that the years 48 and 88, in the last two centuries, at least,\r\nif not longer, had been noted for great changes and revolutions. Thus,\r\nin 1548, the Reformation was first completely established in England;\r\nand, in 1588, the famous pretended invincible Spanish Armada made its\r\nfutile attempt to destroy the Protestantism of Great Britain. In 1648,\r\nKing Charles was condemned to death, and the gravest changes followed;\r\nand, in 1688, occurred the flight of the last of the Stuart kings, and\r\nthe English Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe writer then proceeds to ask, whether there is not something\r\nremarkable “in the revival of the Moravians very nearly about the same\r\ntime with the rise of the Methodists in England; and of a sect of the\r\nsame kind in Scotland, by the field preaching of Erskine and others;\r\nand of exactly the same in Wales by the preaching of Howel Harris; and\r\nof something of the same nature in France, where the principal preacher\r\nconcerned had been executed by the royal will and pleasure. Is there\r\nnot,” the writer continues, “something very surprising in all these\r\npeoples’ rising about the same time, and preaching, all of them, the\r\nsame doctrines, and yet all of them, and all their several intentions\r\nof so doing, being previously unknown to each other?”\r\n\r\nThe above coincidence was more than curious, and the author of the\r\nletter suggests, that such facts and others, which he mentions, may\r\nbe “the dawning of some important religious change, or, at least, of\r\nsomething very extraordinary, which the sacred womb of providence is\r\nbig with.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time as the above, Wesley was engaged in an important\r\ncorrespondence of another kind. Dr. Doddridge was exactly a year older\r\nthan his illustrious Methodist contemporary, was the pastor of a\r\nDissenting congregation at Northampton, and the principal of an academy\r\nfor the education of candidates for the Dissenting ministry. Up to the\r\npresent, Wesley had chiefly lived within the state-church enclosure;\r\nbut now, having become a convert to the principles of Lord King, he\r\noverstepped the enchanted circle, and thought it no disgrace to commune\r\nand mingle with Dissenters. Methodist preachers were multiplying. Few\r\nof them had had the advantages of education and of reading. Their\r\nknowledge, generally speaking, was confined to the first principles\r\nof religion. These were the only subjects on which they either did,\r\nor were able to converse. Of necessity, their preaching was solely on\r\nthe fundamental points of experimental and practical religion; and\r\nhence, their unequalled success in awakening and converting sinners.\r\nPreachers of education and diversified knowledge would, perhaps, not\r\nhave excluded these; but they would, to a large extent, have regaled\r\ntheir hearers with other truths, which, though of great interest, were\r\ninsignificant in point of importance when compared with the few great\r\nand grand cardinal doctrines which formed the staple of all the sermons\r\nof Wesley’s first itinerants. The effect of this unadorned preaching\r\nof the greatest of all verities was surprising. Under these untutored\r\ndiscourses, people found themselves emerging out of thick darkness\r\ninto light, which St. Peter aptly describes as “_marvellous_.”\r\nThese were glorious results, and almost make one wish, that among\r\nthe cultivated and captivating preachers of the present day, who can\r\ndiscourse most eloquently upon any subject, from Eve’s figleaves up\r\nto Aaron’s wardrobe, or from the architecture of Noah’s ark down to\r\nthe whale that swallowed Jonah, there were a sprinkling of men whose\r\npreaching powers, like those of Wesley’s first helpers, were confined\r\nto an incessant utterance, in burning though somewhat boorish words,\r\nof the glorious old truths now-a-days too much neglected,—Repentance\r\ntoward God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, followed by the fruits\r\nof righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. If sinners are to\r\nbe converted, these are the doctrines which _must_ be preached. Other\r\ndoctrines and truths may be interesting, useful, and instructive; these\r\nare absolutely _saving_ and _essential_.\r\n\r\nWesley was devoutly thankful for his uneducated but soul saving\r\npreachers. Still, he saw that, as the Methodists increased in\r\nknowledge, the preachers must keep pace with them. Without this,\r\nthough they might still be as successful as ever in converting\r\nignorant and rude sinners, they would be in danger of being neglected\r\nand even despised by those who, in consequence of conversion, had\r\nbeen greatly raised, in both an intellectual and social sense, above\r\ntheir neighbours. In short, Wesley felt convinced that his preachers\r\nmust not only preach but read; and being persuaded, as a sort of\r\nclerical Dissenter, that good things might be found even in Dissenting\r\nNazareths, he wrote to the most distinguished of all Dissenters\r\nthen existing, to make inquiry. Six months before, he had called on\r\nDoddridge and had addressed his students; now, at Newcastle, in March,\r\n1746, he addressed to him a letter, the nature of which may be gathered\r\nfrom Doddridge’s answer.\r\n\r\n    “_March 15, 1746._\r\n\r\n    “I am grieved and ashamed, that any hurry, public or private,\r\n    should have prevented my answering your obliging letter from\r\n    Newcastle; especially as it has a face of disrespect, where I\r\n    ought to express the very reverse, if I would do justice either\r\n    to you, or my own heart. But you have been used to forgive\r\n    greater injuries. I have unwillingly a guardianship affair\r\n    on hand, on account of which, I must beg your patience for a\r\n    little longer, as to the list of books you desire me to send\r\n    you. I presume the list you desire is chiefly theological.\r\n    Perhaps my desire of making it too particular has hindered me\r\n    from setting about it. But, if God permit, you shall be sure to\r\n    have it in a few weeks.\r\n\r\n    “Let me know how you do, what your success is, and what your\r\n    apprehensions are. I fear we must have some hot flame to melt\r\n    us. Remember in your prayers,\r\n\r\n    “Reverend and dear sir,\r\n    “Your affectionate brother and servant,\r\n    “P. DODDRIDGE.”[592]\r\n\r\nThree months later, Doddridge’s promise was fulfilled, in a long\r\nletter, almost a little pamphlet, dated Northampton, June 18, 1746. He\r\nwrites—\r\n\r\n    “REVEREND AND DEAR SIR,—I set myself down, as well as I can,\r\n    to discharge my promise, and fulfil your request, in giving my\r\n    thoughts on that little collection of books, which you seem\r\n    desirous to make for some of your young preachers.”\r\n\r\nThen follow his recommendations, which we give in brief:—\r\n\r\n    _Logic_—Carmichael, and Dr. Watts.\r\n\r\n    _Metaphysics_—De Urce, Dr. Watts, and Le Clerc.\r\n\r\n    _Ethics_—Puffendorf, and Hutcheson.\r\n\r\n    _Jewish Antiquities_—Lewis, Reland, Calmet, and Prideaux.\r\n\r\n    _Civil History_—Puffendorf, Turselme, and Lampe.\r\n\r\n    _Natural Philosophy_—Rowning, Ray, Cotton Mather, and Derham.\r\n\r\n    _Astronomy_—Watts, Jennings, and Wells.\r\n\r\n    _Natural and Revealed Religion_—Carmichael, Synge, Clarke,\r\n    Gibson, Doddridge, Jefferies, Bullock, Conybeare, Leland, and\r\n    Chandler.\r\n\r\nHe next proceeds to the chief subject, practical divinity, which\r\nhe thinks “ought to employ the greatest part of the care of every\r\npreacher,” and adds:—\r\n\r\n    “I will not presume, sir, to mention to you the divines of the\r\n    Established Church; but as I may reasonably conclude, that the\r\n    Puritans and the divines of the separation are less known to\r\n    you, you will pardon me, if I mention a few of them, and of the\r\n    chief pieces.”\r\n\r\nThen he gives the names of Bolton, Hall, Reynolds, Sibbes, Ward,\r\nJackson, Owen, Goodwin, Baxter, Bates, Flavel, Taylor, and Howe. He\r\ncontinues:—\r\n\r\n    “In recommending the writings of the Dissenters of the present\r\n    age, I would be more sparing; yet permit me to mention Evans,\r\n    Wright, Watts, Henry, Boyce, Bennett, Jennings, and Grosvenor.\r\n    And here, dear sir, I thought to have concluded my letter; but\r\n    it occurs to my mind, that I have said nothing of commentators.\r\n    I have recommended to my pupils Beza, Erasmus, Castellio,\r\n    Heinsius, Patrick, Lowth, Locke, Pierce, Benson, Ainsworth,\r\n    Hammond, Grotius, Brennius, Wells, Calvin, Poole, Le Clerc, and\r\n    Cradock. I might mention several considerable writers, that\r\n    illustrate Scripture, though not direct commentators, such as\r\n    Witsius, Saurin, Mede, Hallet, Edwards, Le Crene, Wolsius,\r\n    Raphelius, Vitringa, Boss, Elsner, and Lardner. But as the\r\n    critical study of Scripture is not so much intended in your\r\n    plan, perhaps you will think, I have gone a little out of the\r\n    way in mentioning so many upon this head.\r\n\r\n    “I am afraid I have by this time thoroughly wearied you. It\r\n    only remains, that I most cordially recommend you and your\r\n    labours to the continued presence and blessing of God, and\r\n    subscribe myself, reverend and dear sir, your most affectionate\r\n    brother, and faithful humble servant,\r\n\r\n    “P. DODDRIDGE.”[593]\r\n\r\nWe return to Wesley. Accompanied by two of his preachers, John Downes,\r\nand William Shepherd, he started from Newcastle for the south, on the\r\n17th of March. When they had ridden between forty and fifty miles,\r\nDownes was so ill that he was unable to proceed farther; and Wesley’s\r\nhorse was so lame, that it could scarcely walk. Wesley writes:—“By\r\nriding thus seven miles, I was thoroughly tired, and my head ached more\r\nthan it had done for months. I then thought, ‘cannot God heal either\r\nman or beast, by any means, or without any?’ Immediately, my weariness\r\nand headache ceased, and my horse’s lameness in the same instant. Nor\r\ndid he halt any more either that day or the next. I here aver a naked\r\nfact; let every man account for it as he sees good.”\r\n\r\nComing to Nottingham, he says: “I had long doubted what it was which\r\nhindered the work of God here. But, upon inquiry, the case was plain.\r\nSo many of the society were either triflers or disorderly walkers, that\r\nthe blessing of God could not rest upon them; so I made short work,\r\ncutting off all such at a stroke, and leaving only a little handful,\r\nwho, as far as can be judged, were really in earnest to save their\r\nsouls.”\r\n\r\nAt Wednesbury and Birmingham, the antinomian teachers had laboured\r\nhard to corrupt the Methodists. One came to Wesley at Birmingham, and\r\nthe following colloquy ensued:—\r\n\r\n    _Wesley._ “Do you believe you have nothing to do with the law\r\n    of God?”\r\n\r\n    _Antinomian._ “I have not: I am not under the law; I live by\r\n    faith.”\r\n\r\n    _W._ “Have you, as living by faith, a right to everything in\r\n    the world?”\r\n\r\n    _A._ “I have: all is mine, since Christ is mine.”\r\n\r\n    _W._ “May you then take anything you will anywhere—suppose out\r\n    of a shop, without the consent or knowledge of the owner?”\r\n\r\n    _A._ “I may, if I want it; for it is mine: only I will not give\r\n    offence.”\r\n\r\n    _W._ “Have you also a right to all the women in the world?”\r\n\r\n    _A._ “Yes, if they consent.”\r\n\r\n    _W._ “And is not that a sin?”\r\n\r\n    _A._ “Yes, to him that thinks it is a sin; but not to those\r\n    whose hearts are free.”\r\n\r\nHorrible! No wonder, that Wesley wrote tracts against antinomian\r\nteachers; and no wonder he adds, “Surely these are the firstborn\r\nchildren of Satan!”\r\n\r\nWesley reached Bristol on March 27; and, eleven days afterwards, laid\r\n“the first stone of the new house at Kingswood;” preaching, on the\r\noccasion, from the words, “For brass I will bring gold,” etc. (Isaiah\r\nlx. 17–22.)\r\n\r\nHe then hurried up to London, where in company with his friend, the\r\nRev. H. Piers, he visited a man who called himself a prophet. Wesley\r\nsays: “We were with him about an hour. But I could not at all think,\r\nthat he was sent of God: 1. Because he appeared to be full of himself,\r\nvain, heady, and opinionated. 2. Because he spoke with extreme\r\nbitterness, both of the king, and of all the bishops, and all the\r\nclergy. 3. Because he aimed at talking Latin, but could not.”\r\n\r\nHaving spent three weeks in London, Wesley, on the 4th of May, again\r\nset out for Bristol; but on the 17th was back to London. Here his\r\nfirst business was to settle the chapels in Bristol, Kingswood, and\r\nNewcastle, upon seven trustees, reserving only to himself and his\r\nbrother, as he says, the liberty of preaching and lodging there.\r\nThis, however, was scarcely correct, so far at least as Newcastle was\r\nconcerned, and as the following synopsis of the trust deed will show.\r\nThe seven trustees, for the Orphan House there, were Henry Jackson,\r\nweaver, and William Mackford, corndealer, both of Newcastle; John\r\nNelson, mason, of Birstal; John Haughton, weaver, of Chinley End;\r\nThomas Richards, late of Trinity College, Oxford; Jonathan Reeves,\r\nbaker, late of Bristol; and Henry Thornton, gentleman, of Grays Inn,\r\nLondon. The trusts were:—1. That Wesley and his brother should have\r\nthe free use of the premises, and likewise any person or persons whom\r\nthey might nominate or appoint during their lifetime. 2. That, after\r\nthe death of the two Wesleys, the trustees should monthly or oftener\r\nnominate and appoint one or more fit person or persons to preach in the\r\nsaid house, in the same manner, as near as may be, as God’s holy word\r\nwas preached at present. 3. That a school should be taught on the said\r\npremises, consisting of forty poor children, to be selected by Wesley\r\nand his brother during their respective lives, and, after their death,\r\nby the trustees. 4. That when, by any cause, the trustees were reduced\r\nto three, they should fill up the vacancies, and make the number seven.\r\n5. That, during their lifetime, the two Wesleys should have the sole\r\nappointment and removal of the masters and mistresses of the school.\r\n6. That every preacher or minister, appointed to the Orphan House,\r\nshould, as long as the appointment lasted, preach in the said house\r\nevery morning and every evening, as had been usual and customary to be\r\ndone.[594]\r\n\r\nSouthey has fallen into an error as to the settlement of chapels.\r\nHe writes:—“Whenever a chapel was built, care was taken, that the\r\nproperty should be vested, not in trustees, but in Mr. Wesley and\r\nthe Conference.” This is incorrect. From the first, the property of\r\nMethodist chapels was always vested in trustees. It is true, that\r\nWesley reserved to himself the right of preaching in such chapels, and\r\nof appointing others to preach therein; but, as Mr. Watson observes,\r\nneither he nor the Conference had any more “property in the best\r\nsecured chapels, than in the poet laureate’s butt of sack.” Wesley\r\nwas glad to divest himself of such property, and to put it into the\r\nhands of others. A year afterwards, he writes: 1747, March 19—“I\r\nconsidered, ‘what would I do now, if I was sure I had but two days\r\nto live?’ All outward things are settled to my wish; the houses at\r\nBristol, Kingswood, and Newcastle are safe; the deeds, whereby they\r\nare conveyed to the trustees, took place on the 5th instant; my will\r\nis made; what have I more to do, but to commend my soul to my merciful\r\nand faithful Creator?”\r\n\r\nHaving made arrangements in London for the settlement of his chapels,\r\nWesley turned his attention to another subject, upon which opinions\r\nwill differ. The number of members in the London society, on the\r\n12th of April, 1746, was 1939, and the amount of their quarterly\r\ncontributions £113 9_s._,[595] upon an average, fourteen pence per\r\nmember. Considering the high price of money, and that nearly the whole\r\nof the London Methodists were extremely poor, the amount subscribed\r\nwas highly creditable. Wesley, however, needed more than this, not for\r\nhimself but others, and propounded a somewhat novel plan for raising it.\r\n\r\nTea was a costly luxury. It was first imported into England about the\r\nyear 1660, when an act of parliament was passed, imposing a duty of\r\neightpence on every gallon of the infusion sold in coffee houses. In\r\n1664, the East India Company bought two pounds two ounces as a royal\r\npresent to his majesty King Charles II. It continued to be sold in\r\nLondon for sixty shillings per pound till the year 1707; and, though\r\nconsiderably cheaper in 1746, it was still a dear indulgence. Wesley\r\nalso believed its use to be injurious.\r\n\r\nHe tells us that, when he first went to Oxford, with an exceeding good\r\nconstitution, and being otherwise in health, he was somewhat surprised\r\nat certain symptoms of a paralytic disorder. His hand shook, especially\r\nafter breakfast; but he soon observed that, if for two or three days he\r\nintermitted drinking tea, the shaking ceased. Upon inquiry, he found\r\ntea had the same effect on others, and particularly on persons whose\r\nnerves were weak. This led him to lessen the quantity he took, and to\r\ndrink it weaker; but still, for above six and twenty years, he was more\r\nor less subject to the same disorder.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1746, he began to observe, that abundance of the people of\r\nLondon were similarly affected, some of them having their nerves\r\nunstrung, and their bodily strength decayed. He asked them if they\r\nwere hard drinkers; they replied, “No, indeed, we drink scarce anything\r\nbut a little tea, morning and night.” He says:\r\n\r\n    “I immediately remembered my own case, and easily gathered,\r\n    from many concurring circumstances, that it was the same case\r\n    with them. I considered, ‘what an advantage would it be to\r\n    these poor enfeebled people, if they would leave off what\r\n    so manifestly impairs their health, and thereby hurts their\r\n    business also! If they used English herbs instead of tea, they\r\n    might, hereby, not only lessen their pain, but in some degree\r\n    their poverty. How much might be saved in so numerous a body as\r\n    the Methodists, even in this single article of expense! And how\r\n    greatly is all that can possibly be saved, in every article,\r\n    wanted daily by those who have not even food convenient for\r\n    them! Some of the Methodists had not food to sustain nature;\r\n    some were destitute of necessary clothing; and some had not\r\n    where to lay their heads. The little weekly contributions were\r\n    barely sufficient to relieve the sick.’ I reflected ‘what\r\n    might be done, if ten thousand, or one thousand, or only five\r\n    hundred, would save all they could in this single instance,\r\n    and put their savings into the poor-box weekly, to feed the\r\n    hungry, and to clothe the naked!’ I thought further: ‘many\r\n    tell me to my face, I can persuade this people to anything. I\r\n    will make a fair trial. If I can persuade any number, many who\r\n    are now weak or sick will be restored to health and strength;\r\n    many will pay those debts which others, perhaps equally poor,\r\n    can but ill afford to lose; many will be less straitened in\r\n    their own families; many, by helping their neighbour, will lay\r\n    up for themselves treasures in heaven.’ Immediately it struck\r\n    me, ‘but example must go before precept; therefore, I must\r\n    not plead an exemption for myself, from a daily practice of\r\n    twenty-seven years: I must begin.’ I did so; the three first\r\n    days my head ached, more or less, all day long, and I was\r\n    half asleep from morning to night. The third day, my memory\r\n    failed, almost entirely. In the evening, I sought my remedy in\r\n    prayer; and next morning my headache was gone, and my memory\r\n    as strong as ever. And I have found no inconvenience, but a\r\n    sensible benefit, in several respects, from that day to this.\r\n    My paralytic complaints are all gone; my hand is as steady now\r\n    (1748) as it was at fifteen; and so considerable a difference\r\n    do I find in my expense, that, in only those four families at\r\n    London, Bristol, Kingswood, and Newcastle, I save upwards of\r\n    fifty pounds a year.”\r\n\r\nHaving set the example, Wesley recommended the same abstinence to a few\r\nof his preachers; and, a week later, to about a hundred of his people\r\nwhom he believed to be strong in faith; all of whom, with two or three\r\nexceptions, resolved, by the grace of God, to make the trial without\r\ndelay. In a short time, he proposed it to the whole society. Objections\r\nrose in abundance. Some said, “Tea is not unwholesome at all.” To\r\nthese, he replied that many eminent physicians had declared it was; and\r\nthat, if frequently used by those of weak nerves, it is no other than\r\na slow poison. Others said, “Tea is not unwholesome to me: why then\r\nshould I leave it off?” Wesley answered, “To give an example to those\r\nto whom it is undeniably prejudicial, and to have the more wherewith\r\nto feed the hungry and to clothe the naked.” Others said, “It helps my\r\nhealth; nothing else will agree with me.” To such, Wesley’s caustic\r\nreply was, “I suppose your body is much of the same kind with that\r\nof your great grandmother; and do you think nothing else agreed with\r\nher, or with any of her progenitors? What poor, puling, sickly things,\r\nmust all the English then have been, till within these hundred years!\r\nBesides, if, in fact, nothing else will agree with you,—if tea has\r\nalready weakened your stomach, and impaired your digestion to such a\r\ndegree, it has hurt you more than you are aware. You have need to abhor\r\nit as deadly poison, and to renounce it from this very hour.”[596]\r\n\r\nWhat was the result of Wesley’s attempt to form a _tea_-total society?\r\nWe can hardly tell; except that he himself abstained from tea for the\r\nnext twelve years, until Dr. Fothergill ordered him to resume its\r\nuse.[597] Charles Wesley began to abstain, but how long his abstinence\r\nlasted we are not informed. About a hundred of the London Methodists\r\nfollowed the example of their leader; and, besides these, a large\r\nnumber of others began to be _temperate_, and to use less than they had\r\npreviously.[598]\r\n\r\nThis was, to say the least, an amusing episode in Wesley’s laborious\r\nlife. All must give him credit for the best and most benevolent\r\nintentions; and it is right to add, that, ten days after his proposal\r\nwas submitted to the London society, he had collected among his friends\r\nthirty pounds for “a lending stock,” and that this was soon made up to\r\nfifty, by means of which, before the year was ended, above two hundred\r\nand fifty destitute persons had received acceptable relief.\r\n\r\nOn July 20, Wesley set out for Bristol, where he spent the next\r\nfortnight. While here he paid a visit to Oakhill, near Shepton Mallet,\r\nwhere “the good curate” hired a drunken mob to make disturbance.\r\nAs soon as Wesley began preaching, the “drunken champions” began\r\n“screaming out a psalm”; but Wesley says, “our singing quickly\r\nswallowed up theirs. Soon after, their orator named a text, and\r\npreached a sermon; his attendants meantime being busy in throwing\r\nstones and dirt” at Wesley’s congregation.\r\n\r\nOn August 10, Wesley went to Wales. He preached in Builth churchyard\r\nto nearly all the inhabitants that the town contained. At Maesmennys,\r\nLanzufried, and Wenvo, he preached in the parish churches; and at\r\nCardiff in the castle yard. At Neath, he found twelve young men whom,\r\nhe says, he almost envied. They lived together in one house, and gave\r\naway whatever they earned above the necessaries of life. Most of them\r\nwere predestinarians, but so little bigoted to their opinions, that\r\nthey would not suffer a predestinarian to preach among them, unless\r\nhe would avoid controversy. Here Wesley preached in the open street,\r\na gentleman and a drunken fiddler doing their best to interrupt his\r\nservice; but, none joining them, they were soon ashamed, and the\r\ngentleman slunk away on one side, and the fiddler on the other. At\r\nMargam, he had to have a Welsh interpreter; and at Leominster (to which\r\nhe went during his tour), he began preaching on a tombstone, on the\r\nsouth side of the parish church, but was not allowed to finish. The\r\nmob “roared on every side”; the bells were set a ringing; and then\r\nthe organ began to play amain. Wesley’s voice was drowned, and hence\r\nhe thought it advisable to remove to the corn market, where he had\r\na “quiet time,” and “showed what that sect is, which is ‘everywhere\r\nspoken against.’”\r\n\r\nReturning to Bristol, he started, on September 1, for Cornwall. At\r\nSt. Just, he found the liveliest society in the county, and yet a few\r\nof the members he was “obliged to reprove for negligence in meeting,\r\nwhich,” says he, “is always the forerunner of greater evils.” At\r\nSithney, he preached by moonlight; and, at Gwennap, to an “immense\r\nmultitude,” a funeral sermon for Thomas Hitchins, from, “To me to live\r\nis Christ, and to die is gain.”\r\n\r\nHaving spent a fortnight among the Cornish Methodists, he set out,\r\non the 16th of September, for London, his brother meeting him at\r\nUxbridge, and becoming his escort to the capital.[599]\r\n\r\nAfter a week in London, he paid a visit to his friend Perronet,\r\npreaching, on the way, at Sevenoaks, “to a large, wild company,” one of\r\nwhom cursed him bitterly. At Shoreham, he preached twice in Perronet’s\r\nchurch; but says, “the congregation seemed to understand just nothing\r\nof the matter.” The rest of the year was spent in the metropolis.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated, that Wesley, for conscience sake, was now\r\nan abstainer from tea. Before the year expired, he went a step further.\r\nHe writes: December 29—“I resumed my vegetable diet (which I had now\r\ndiscontinued for several years), and found it of use both to my soul\r\nand body; but, after two years, a violent flux, which seized me in\r\nIreland, obliged me to return to the use of animal food.”\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought about the wisdom of a man, of such active\r\nhabits, adopting such an abstemious, anchorite sort of diet, there can\r\nbe no question about the fact, that his motives were of the highest\r\nand purest kind. He gave up tea, that he might benefit the poor; and,\r\ncontemporaneously with his resumption of a vegetable diet, he commenced\r\nan institution, which, to say the least, was not then so popular and so\r\ncommon as it is at present. He writes: “I mentioned my design of giving\r\nphysic to the poor. In three weeks about three hundred came.” Such is\r\nthe entry in his Journal.\r\n\r\nHe had already provided a fund for relieving the necessities of the\r\npoor by furnishing them with food and clothing; but something more\r\nwas requisite. Many of them were sick; their sufferings stirred his\r\nsympathy; and yet he knew not how to help them. “At length,” he says,\r\n“I thought of a kind of desperate expedient: ‘I will prepare and give\r\nthem physic myself.’ For six or seven and twenty years, I had made\r\nanatomy and physic the diversion of my leisure hours; though I never\r\nproperly studied them, unless for a few months when I was going to\r\nAmerica, where I imagined I might be of some service to those who had\r\nno regular physician among them. I applied to it again. I took into my\r\nassistance an apothecary, and an experienced surgeon; resolving, at the\r\nsame time, not to go out of my depth, but to leave all difficult and\r\ncomplicated cases to such physicians as the patients should choose. I\r\ngave notice of this to the society; and, in five months, medicines were\r\noccasionally given to above five hundred persons. Several of these I\r\nnever saw before; for I did not regard whether they were of the society\r\nor not. In that time, seventy-one of these, regularly taking their\r\nmedicines, and following the regimen prescribed (which three in four\r\nwould not do), were entirely cured of distempers long thought to be\r\nincurable. The whole expense of medicines, during this time, was nearly\r\nforty pounds.”[600]\r\n\r\nThis was a bold step, and exposed Wesley to animadversion. He was not\r\na legally qualified medical practitioner, and there were not wanting\r\nthose who were ready to brand him as a quack. His defence was, that the\r\npoor were neglected; that physicians were often useless; and that his\r\nown gratuitous treatment was successful. In a letter, published in the\r\n_Bath Journal_, in 1749, he writes: “I do not know that any one patient\r\nyet has died under my hands. If any person does, let him declare it,\r\nwith the time and circumstances.”[601] And, in another letter addressed\r\nto Archbishop Secker, in 1747, four months after his dispensary was\r\nopened, he remarks:—\r\n\r\n    “For more than twenty years, I have had numberless proofs,\r\n    that regular physicians do exceeding little good. From a deep\r\n    conviction of this, I have believed it my duty, within these\r\n    four months last past, to prescribe such medicines to six or\r\n    seven hundred of the poor as I knew were proper for their\r\n    several disorders. Within six weeks, nine in ten of them, who\r\n    had taken these medicines, were remarkably altered for the\r\n    better; and many were cured of disorders under which they had\r\n    laboured for ten, twenty, forty years. Now, ought I to have let\r\n    one of these poor wretches perish, because I was not a regular\r\n    physician? to have said, ‘I know what will cure you; but I am\r\n    not of the college; you must send for Dr. Mead’? Before Dr.\r\n    Mead had come in his chariot, the man might have been in his\r\n    coffin. And when the doctor was come, where was his fee? What!\r\n    he cannot live upon nothing! So, instead of an orderly cure,\r\n    the patient dies; and God requires his blood at my hands.”[602]\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to answer this, and Wesley was not the man to be\r\nbrowbeaten from the path of duty by envious and angry members of the\r\nhealing profession. Indeed, his success was such, that, within two\r\nmonths after opening his dispensary at the Foundery in London, he\r\ninstituted a second in Bristol, and writing to his friend and patron,\r\nMr. Ebenezer Blackwell, says, “Our number of patients increases\r\nin Bristol daily. We have now upwards of two hundred. Many have\r\nalready desired to return thanks, having found a considerable change\r\nfor the better already. But we are at a great loss for medicines;\r\nseveral of those we should choose being not to be had at any price in\r\nBristol.”[603]\r\n\r\nThere are only two other matters, belonging to the year 1746,\r\nwhich require attention; namely, Wesley’s conference, and Wesley’s\r\npublications.\r\n\r\nThe conference commenced in Bristol on the 12th of May, and lasted four\r\ndays.[604] Four clergymen were present—the two Wesleys, and Messrs.\r\nHodges and Taylor. Besides these, there were four itinerants, Messrs.\r\nReeves, Maxfield, Westall, and Willis; and also Thomas Glascot, of\r\nwhom we know nothing. As at former conferences, so at this, doctrines\r\nwere reviewed, and carefully guarded against error and abuse; and,\r\nafter this, points of discipline were discussed and settled. It was\r\nagreed, that “the properest persons to be present,” at the annual\r\nconferences, were—1. The preachers. 2. The most earnest and most\r\nsensible of the bandleaders living in the town where the conference\r\nwas held. 3. Any pious and judicious stranger who might be visiting\r\nthe place. It was thought, that it might be useful to read one or\r\nmore of Wesley’s tracts at each conference, were it only to correct\r\nerrors, or to explain obscurities. Wesley’s helpers were defined to\r\nbe “extraordinary messengers, designed of God to provoke the others\r\nto jealousy.” It was resolved, that those who believed themselves to\r\nbe called of God to preach should be strictly examined on the three\r\npoints, Have they grace, gifts, and fruit? and that those in whom\r\nthese three marks undeniably concurred should be allowed to have such\r\na call. It was thought that, at present, they were not preaching the\r\natonement so much as they did at first; and that the sermons which were\r\nattended with the greatest blessing, were—“1. Such as were most close,\r\nconvincing, particular. 2. Such as had most of Christ, the Priest, the\r\nAtonement. 3. Such as urged the heinousness of men’s living in contempt\r\nor ignorance of Him.” It was determined, that a sufficient call of\r\nProvidence to a new place was an invitation from some worthy person,\r\nand a probability of doing more good by going thither, than by staying\r\nlonger where they were. New members were to be admitted into the bands\r\nand societies only once a quarter, their names having been previously\r\nread at meetings of the existing members; and, at the same time, had to\r\nbe read the names of those excluded from the society. Directions were\r\ngiven to guard against formality in public singing. Efforts were to be\r\nemployed to induce the people to attend the church; and, as an example\r\nto the Bristol Methodists, it was agreed, that the Bristol preachers\r\nshould go to St. James’s church every Wednesday and Friday. The country\r\nwas divided into seven circuits, namely—1. London, including Brentford,\r\nEgham, Windsor, Wycombe, and the three counties of Surrey, Kent, and\r\nEssex. 2. Bristol, including the isle of Portland, and the counties\r\nof Somerset, Wilts, Oxford, and Gloucester. 3. Cornwall. 4. Evesham,\r\nembracing Shrewsbury, Leominster, Hereford, and all the places from\r\nStroud to Wednesbury. 5. Yorkshire, to which was to be attached the\r\nsix counties of Cheshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire,\r\nRutlandshire, and Lincolnshire. 6. Newcastle. 7. Wales. The present\r\nassistants were Reeves, Bennet, Haughton, Nelson, Wheatley, Trembath,\r\nWestall, Richards, Downes, Meyrick, Maxfield, and Walker. And to these,\r\nperhaps, would be added, Jones, Larwood, and Cownley. Copies of the\r\nminutes of the conferences were to be given only to those who were or\r\nmight have been present; but they were to be read to the stewards and\r\nleaders of bands, the Sunday and Thursday following each conference.\r\n\r\nSuch is a synopsis of the proceedings of the conference of 1746.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Wesley’s almost incessant travelling and preaching,\r\nhe still found time to write. Two of his publications, in 1746, were\r\npartly his own, but principally his brother’s.\r\n\r\nFirst: “Hymns for those that seek, and those that have, Redemption in\r\nthe Blood of Jesus Christ.” 12mo, 68 pages. Twenty-eight of these hymns\r\nare inserted in the Wesleyan Hymn-Book, and are among the finest that\r\nthe book contains. One of them, evidently written by Wesley himself,\r\nbegins with the line, “How happy is the pilgrim’s lot;” and though two\r\nor three of the verses are not suitable for a mixed congregation to\r\nsing, the whole is strikingly descriptive of Wesley’s own condition and\r\nexperience. He had no wife, and no children, and had just transferred\r\nhis chapels to trustees, and, hence, could sing what many in Methodist\r\ncongregations cannot.\r\n\r\n    “I have no babes to hold me here;\r\n    But children more securely dear\r\n      For mine I humbly claim;\r\n    Better than daughters or than sons,\r\n    Temples Divine of living stones,\r\n      Inscribed with Jesu’s name.\r\n\r\n    No foot of land do I possess,\r\n    No cottage in this wilderness\r\n      A poor, wayfaring man,\r\n    I lodge awhile in tents below;\r\n    Or gladly wander to and fro,\r\n      Till I my Canaan gain.\r\n\r\n    I have no sharer of my heart,\r\n    To rob my Saviour of a part,\r\n      And desecrate the whole;\r\n    Only betrothed to Christ am I,\r\n    And wait His coming from the sky,\r\n      To wed my happy soul.\r\n\r\n    Nothing on earth I call my own,\r\n    A stranger, to the world unknown,\r\n      I all their goods despise;\r\n    I trample on their whole delight,\r\n    And seek a country out of sight,\r\n      A country in the skies.”\r\n\r\nSecond. The other joint publication was, “Hymns of Petition and\r\nThanksgiving for the Promise of the Father.” By John and Charles\r\nWesley. 12mo, 36 pages. These were thirty-two in number, and were\r\nspecially intended for use at Whitsuntide. Several of the best of them\r\nare in the Methodist Hymn-Book.[605]\r\n\r\nWesley’s other publications were the following:—\r\n\r\n1. “A Word of Advice to Saints and Sinners.” 12mo, 12 pages.\r\n\r\n2. “Lessons for Children. Part I.” 12mo, 76 pages; with a vignette on\r\nthe title-page of an angel on clouds, with a scroll in one hand, and\r\na trumpet in the other. The lessons are fifty-four in number, and are\r\nalmost entirely taken from the five books of Moses. Prefixed is an\r\naddress “to all parents and schoolmasters,” in which Wesley says:—\r\n\r\n    “I have endeavoured in the following lessons to select the\r\n    plainest and most useful portions of Scripture; such as\r\n    children may the most easily understand, and such as it most\r\n    concerns them to know. These are set down in the same order,\r\n    and generally in the same words, wherein they are delivered\r\n    by the Spirit of God. Where an expression is less easy to\r\n    be understood, I have subjoined a word or two by way of\r\n    explication. I cannot but earnestly entreat you, to take good\r\n    heed, how you teach these deep things of God. Beware of that\r\n    common, but accursed way, of making children parrots, instead\r\n    of Christians. Regard not _how much_, but to how good purpose\r\n    they read. Turn each sentence every way, propose it in every\r\n    light, and question them continually on every point.”\r\n\r\n3. In the month of March, the Rev. Thomas Church, vicar of Battersea,\r\npublished another two shilling pamphlet, entitled, “Some further\r\nRemarks on Mr. Wesley’s last Journal;”[606] and, in July,[607] Wesley\r\nissued, “The Principles of a Methodist farther explained; occasioned\r\nby the Reverend Mr. Church’s second letter to Mr. Wesley; in a second\r\nletter to that gentleman.” 12mo, 79 pages. First of all, Wesley\r\ntakes up the case of the Moravians; and then explains his views of\r\njustification, and of the faith and repentance preceding it. Next he\r\nvindicates himself against the charge of violating the discipline of\r\nthe Church of England, and of his being an enthusiast. He declares his\r\nbelief, that, in points of importance, when the reasons brought on each\r\nside appear to be of equal weight, it is right to decide the question\r\nby casting lots; that there are still such persons as demoniacs, and\r\nwill be such as long as Satan is the god of this world; and that there\r\nis nothing either in the Old Testament or the New which teaches, that\r\n“miracles were to be confined within the limits of the apostolic or\r\nthe Cyprianic age, or, that God hath in any way precluded Himself from\r\nworking miracles, in any kind or degree, in any age to the end of\r\ntime.” The pamphlet must be read to be appreciated. It is _multum in\r\nparvo_.\r\n\r\nIn November, Wesley, for the first time, published a _volume_ of\r\nsermons, price, in sheets, half-a-crown.[608] The title was, “Sermons\r\non Several Occasions;” and the book is the first of the _four volumes\r\nof sermons_, which, with the Notes on the New Testament, were\r\nafterwards constituted the perpetual standard of Methodist theology.\r\nThese are so widely and so well known that further description is\r\nunneeded. The preface, however, deserves notice. It states that the\r\nsermons contain the substance of what Wesley had been preaching during\r\nthe last eight years; and, that there was no point of doctrine, on\r\nwhich he had been accustomed to speak in public, which was not here,\r\nincidentally, if not professedly, laid before the reader. Wesley adds:—\r\n\r\n    “Nothing here appears in an elaborate, elegant, or oratorical\r\n    dress. If it had been my desire or design to write thus,\r\n    my leisure would not permit. But, in truth, I, at present,\r\n    designed nothing less; for I now write, as I generally speak,\r\n    _ad populum_. I design plain truth for plain people; therefore,\r\n    of set purpose, I abstain from all nice and philosophical\r\n    speculations; from all perplexed and intricate reasonings; and,\r\n    as far as possible, from even the show of learning, unless\r\n    in sometimes citing the original Scripture. I have thought,\r\n    I am a creature of a day. I am a spirit come from God, and\r\n    returning to God. I want to know one thing,—the way to heaven.\r\n    God Himself has condescended to teach me the way. He hath\r\n    written it down in a book. O give me that book! At any price,\r\n    give me the book of God! I have it; here is knowledge enough\r\n    for me. Let me be _homo unius libri_. Here then I am, far from\r\n    the busy ways of men. I sit down alone: only God is here. In\r\n    His presence, I read His book; for this end, to find the way\r\n    to heaven. Is there a doubt concerning the meaning of what\r\n    I read? I lift up my heart to the Father of lights, and ask\r\n    Him to let me know His will. I then search after and consider\r\n    parallel passages of Scripture. I meditate thereon with all the\r\n    attention and earnestness of which my mind is capable. If any\r\n    doubt still remains, I consult those who are experienced in the\r\n    things of God; and then the writings whereby, being dead, they\r\n    yet speak. And what I thus learn, that I teach.”\r\n\r\nThis is very beautiful. Wesley was no copyist. He owed his theology\r\nto no class of theologians, either ancient or modern,—Moravian or\r\notherwise. Peter Bohler and others might suggest truths like the grand\r\nold doctrine of salvation by faith only; but before adopting them\r\nWesley went to the only pure fount of theology existing, and deduced\r\nhis creed, not from Bohler’s notions, but from the book of God. His\r\nbelief was thus founded upon a rock, and he felt it so. He declares,\r\nthat his mind is open to conviction; but, at the same time, he was\r\nconscious that he had, not only human, but Divine authority for what he\r\ntaught. Let all divinity students copy his example.\r\n\r\nWesley’s last publication, in 1746, was Parts II. and III. of his\r\n“Farther Appeal to Men of Reason and Religion.” 12mo, 139 pages. In\r\nsome respects, this was one of the severest works that Wesley ever\r\ncommitted to the press. With terrible power, he depicts the wickedness\r\nof the nation,—forgetfulness of God and neglect of His holy ordinances,\r\nswearing, perjury, sabbath breaking, drunkenness, lasciviousness,\r\nspeaking evil of dignities, and robbery. Attorneys are lashed as\r\nbeing, in some instances, less honest than pickpockets; and the way in\r\nwhich they whipped money out of their clients’ purses is so described,\r\nthat an unjust lawyer by whom Wesley himself had been victimised sent\r\nhim back half the amount he had extorted from him. The guardians of\r\npublic charities are charged with sacrilege. Lying was one of the\r\nfashions of the day; and language was swollen with compliment. Pride\r\nwas rampant; and even cobblers, in London, thought themselves wiser\r\nthan secretaries of state, and coffee house disputers abler divines\r\nthan archbishops. Prisons were schools of vice, out of which prisoners\r\nemerged fitted for any kind or degree of villainy, perfectly brutal and\r\ndevilish, thoroughly furnished for every evil word and work. In the\r\narmy, profanity was fearful. In the navy, almost every man-of-war was\r\na floating hell. The clergy were not free from the taint of lewdness\r\nand drunkenness, from covetousness and idleness, from neglecting the\r\npoor and flattering the rich. Presbyterians, in many instances, kept\r\na conscience void of offence, but they had among them drunkards,\r\ngluttons, dishonest dealers, and extortioners. Baptists were far from\r\nbeing faultless. Quakers affected great sanctity and simplicity, and\r\nyet many of their women wore gold upon their very feet, and their men\r\nmight be seen with glittering canes and snuff-boxes, even in their\r\nsolemn assemblies; their female members were too strict to lay out\r\na shilling in a necklace, but not too strict to lay out fourscore\r\nguineas in a repeating watch; in one kind of apron or handkerchief they\r\ndurst not expend twenty shillings, but in another sort would, expend\r\ntwenty pounds; they declined to touch a coloured ribbon, but would\r\ncover themselves from head to foot in costly silk. Papists, Jews, and\r\ninfidels are castigated with equal severity; and with them the second\r\npart of the Appeal concludes.\r\n\r\nThe third Part commences with an account of the present revival of\r\nreligion, and of the brutal persecutions with which it had been\r\nassailed. Then objections are answered. Wesley states, that he has\r\nseven thousand persons in his societies, whose souls he could not\r\nneglect without endangering his own salvation. He shows the difference\r\nbetween other reformations of the church, and that with which he and\r\nhis contemporaries were identified, and concludes thus:—\r\n\r\n    “The difference is wide between our case and the case of any\r\n    of those above mentioned. They _avowedly separated_ from the\r\n    church; we utterly _disavow_ any such design. They severely,\r\n    and almost continually, inveighed against the _doctrines_ and\r\n    _discipline_ of the church they left; we approve both the\r\n    _doctrines_ and _discipline_ of our church, and inveigh only\r\n    against _ungodliness_ and _unrighteousness_. They spent great\r\n    part of their time and strength in contending about externals\r\n    and circumstantials; we agree with you in both; so that\r\n    having no room to spend any time in such contentions, we have\r\n    one desire of spending and being spent, in promoting plain,\r\n    _practical religion_.”\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, in a brief summary like this, to give an adequate\r\nidea of these “Appeals,” the best defence of Methodism extant. They are\r\namong the most elaborate of Wesley’s productions; giving a melancholy\r\nview of the low state of religion and of public morals, when he and\r\nhis brother Methodists entered upon their extraordinary career of\r\nministerial labour; and containing a triumphant vindication of their\r\ndoctrines and proceedings. They all are pervaded with a spirit of great\r\nseriousness, and display a mind deeply affected by the sins and follies\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1747.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1747 Age 44]\r\n\r\nFor a moment, let us look at Whitefield, who spent the year 1747 in\r\nAmerica. Wesley had written him on the subject of union; to which he\r\nreplied on the 11th of September, as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “DEAR AND REVEREND SIR,—Not long ago I received your kind\r\n    letter, dated in February last. My heart is really for an\r\n    outward, as well as an inward union. Nothing shall be wanting\r\n    on my part to bring it about; but I cannot see how it can\r\n    possibly be effected, till we all think and speak the same\r\n    things. I rejoice to hear that you and your brother are more\r\n    moderate with respect to _sinless perfection_. Time and\r\n    experience, I believe, will convince you that, attaining such\r\n    a state in this life, is not the doctrine of the everlasting\r\n    gospel. As for _universal redemption_, if we omit on each side\r\n    the talking for or against reprobation, which we may fairly\r\n    do, and agree, as we already do, in giving an universal offer\r\n    to all poor sinners that will come and taste of the water of\r\n    life, I think we may manage very well. But it is difficult to\r\n    determine such matters at a distance. Some time next year, I\r\n    hope to see you face to face. I hope ere long to be delivered\r\n    from my outward embarrassments. I long to owe no man anything\r\n    but love. This is a debt, reverend sir, I shall never be able\r\n    to discharge to you, or your brother. Jesus will pay you all.\r\n    For His sake, I love and honour you very much, and rejoice as\r\n    much in your success as in my own. I cannot agree with you in\r\n    some principles, but that need not hinder love. What have you\r\n    done with the Moravian Brethren? Their affairs are in confusion\r\n    here. I think their foundation is too narrow for their\r\n    superstructure. I believe, in their plan, there are many plants\r\n    that our heavenly Father hath not planted. The Lord bless what\r\n    is right, and rectify what is wrong in them, in us, and in all.\r\n    O for heaven! where we shall mistake, judge, and grieve one\r\n    another no more. Continue to pray for us, and assure yourself,\r\n    that you are always remembered by, reverend and very dear sir,\r\n    your most affectionate, though unworthy younger brother and\r\n    willing servant for Christ’s sake,\r\n\r\n    “GEORGE WHITEFIELD.”[609]\r\n\r\nSo much for Whitefield. What about his English coadjutors? Howel Harris\r\nwrites:—\r\n\r\n    “Wales is like the garden of the Lord; many are awakened, and\r\n    fresh doors are opened. All the ministers and exhorters go\r\n    on heartily, and the presence and power of the Lord are still\r\n    more manifest. Hasten thy winged motion, oh glorious day! when\r\n    I shall see Paul and Barnabas, Luther and Calvin, and all the\r\n    saints, joining in one song, and not so much as remembering\r\n    that they ever differed. I have lately, at their own request,\r\n    discoursed three or four times before several gentlemen,\r\n    ladies of fashion, some magistrates, counsellors, attorneys,\r\n    and doctors in divinity, and they behaved well. I have been\r\n    all round South Wales, travelling often twenty, and sometimes\r\n    thirty miles a day, and preaching twice, besides settling and\r\n    conferring with the societies everywhere. I am about to begin a\r\n    round through North Wales, where I expect to be sent home, or\r\n    at least imprisoned. For ten days, my life will be in continual\r\n    danger.”\r\n\r\nJoseph Williams, of Kidderminster, relates, that he had recently\r\nbeen on a preaching tour in Wales, and in Yorkshire. At Haworth, he\r\nhad taken a bed at the house of Grimshaw, with whom he held sweet\r\nfellowship, from six o’clock at night till two o’clock next morning.\r\nGrimshaw’s church was always crowded, and hundreds were not able to\r\nget in at all. People flocked to hear him from all the neighbouring\r\ntowns, and as many as a hundred strangers were accustomed, on a Sunday,\r\nto dine at the village inn. The surrounding clergy were caballing to\r\nget him suspended; and, if they succeeded, he was resolved to become\r\nat once an itinerant preacher. The landlord, at Colne, told Williams\r\nthat Grimshaw had preached in that town “damnation beyond all sense and\r\nreason,” his sermon lasting two long hours; and that, “every week, and\r\nalmost every day, he preached in barns and private houses, and was a\r\ngreat encourager of conventicles.”\r\n\r\nThomas Adams says, he had been preaching in a barn at Gosport, and\r\nthat in the neighbourhood of Portsmouth the good work was prospering.\r\nIn Wilts, he had seen religion reviving. In Gloucestershire, his\r\nlabours had been blessed, and the meetings of the societies had been a\r\npentecost. When at Bristol there had been “a brave shaking among the\r\ndry bones.”\r\n\r\nJames Relly (who afterwards founded a sect called “Rellyan\r\nUniversalists,”) observes, that at Bristol he had examined the whole\r\nsociety once a week, but the place had been “a furnace” to him. At\r\nBath, he had “particular freedom.” In Gloucestershire, he had been\r\npreaching every day, and thrice on Sundays; and had found the people\r\n“honest, simple, and hungering after the bread of life.” At Wednesbury,\r\nhe found his heart enlarged every time he preached. At Birmingham, he\r\nhad formed a society of twenty members, and had left them with great\r\nregret. At Bromsgrove, he had preached in an Independent chapel, to a\r\ncongregation of “simple, loving souls.” At Tewkesbury, a furious mob\r\nassaulted him, swore, cursed, laughed, pricked the congregation with\r\npins, threw handfuls of snuff among them, and brickbats and dirt; and\r\nbroke the windows of the house; but, in the midst of all, he continued\r\npreaching for an hour.\r\n\r\nJohn Relly was witnessing “many inroads made in Satan’s kingdom,” and\r\nhe seldom preached without seeing conversions.\r\n\r\nHerbert Jenkins had been preaching in Scotland, and conversing with the\r\nclergy, many of whom he pronounces to be “good men, and very powerful\r\npreachers.” In Edinburgh, he had found nearly twenty societies,\r\nincluding one composed of soldiers, who had fought at the battle of\r\nCulloden. In the park, he had had a congregation of many thousands.\r\n“At Glasgow,” says the _Scots Magazine_, “he was complimented with the\r\nfreedom of the city, and was entertained by the magistrates and by the\r\npresbytery. He made no public collections as Whitefield did, and his\r\nbehaviour altogether was inoffensive and becoming.”\r\n\r\nJohn Edwards had made a tour through the midland counties, where “King\r\nJesus was getting Himself the victory.” He writes:—“Oh what times and\r\nseasons we have had; souls fired with the love of God, and following\r\nthe word from place to place, horse and foot, like men engaged in a\r\nwar, determined to take the city by force of arms.” At Haverfordwest\r\nand in Wales, multitudes flocked to hear him.\r\n\r\nCertain members of the Tabernacle society, in London, relate that the\r\nplace was generally full; and a gentleman at Plymouth writes, that “the\r\nwork goes on very comfortably there.”[610]\r\n\r\nThese hints will suggest to the reader an idea of the work that was\r\nbeing done by the preachers who propagated Whitefield’s doctrines.\r\nAll the letters, filling more than a hundred pages of the “Christian\r\nHistory,” breathe the most ardent piety, and are full of gratitude,\r\nhope, and exultation.\r\n\r\nCharles Wesley spent the first two months of 1747 in a journey from\r\nNewcastle to Bristol. The next six months he made London and Bristol\r\nthe centre of his operations. The last four months of the year were\r\nemployed in Ireland.\r\n\r\nWesley himself was travelling almost incessantly, and we must now try\r\nto follow him.\r\n\r\nOn January 11 he left London for Bristol. Reaching Devizes, he found\r\nthe town in the greatest uproar. Swelling words, oaths, curses, and\r\nthreatenings were abundant. Mr. Innys, the curate, who knew of Wesley’s\r\ncoming, had spent the day in visiting from house to house, to stir up\r\nthe people against him. He had also published an advertisement, in\r\nthe most public places in the town, of “An obnubilative, pantomime\r\nentertainment, to be exhibited at Mr. Clark’s,” in whose house\r\nWesley had to preach. For the present, however, the high purpose of\r\nthe zealous curate was not realised. At the appointed hour, Wesley\r\ncommenced preaching. The well instigated mob were listeners, but they\r\nwere all dumb dogs, and attention sat on every face.\r\n\r\nSixteen days afterwards, Wesley returned to this clerical preserve,\r\nwhere he again found, that great efforts had been used to raise a\r\nrabble, but, he writes, “it was lost labour; all that could be mustered\r\nwere a few straggling soldiers, and forty or fifty boys.”\r\n\r\nWesley told his brother, “there was no such thing as raising a mob at\r\nDevizes”; but Charles soon found it to be otherwise. Coming within a\r\nmonth after, on February 24, a crowd awaited him, headed by “the chief\r\ngentleman of the town,” while Mr. Innys, the energetic curate, stood\r\nwith them in the street, jumping for very joy. The reverend persecutor\r\nhad been more successful in organising ruffians to do his dirty work,\r\nin the case of Charles, than he had been in the case of Wesley himself.\r\nHe had declared in the pulpit, as well as from house to house, that he\r\nhad heard Charles preach blasphemy before the university, and tell his\r\ncongregation, “If you don’t receive the Holy Ghost while I breathe upon\r\nyou, you will all be damned.” He had secured the services of two of\r\nthe chief men in the borough, Messrs. Sutton and Willy, both of them\r\nDissenters. The poor parson was so supremely happy, that he began to\r\ndance. The church bells were rung backwards. Mrs. Philip’s house was\r\nransacked; the windows were smashed, and the shutters of the shop torn\r\ndown; the door was blocked up with a wagon; and lights were kindled to\r\nprevent the preacher’s escaping. The mob then proceeded to the inn,\r\nand seized the horses of Charles Wesley and his friend Meriton, and,\r\nsome hours afterwards, the poor animals were found in a pond, up to the\r\nneck in water. A water engine was played into the house where Charles\r\nwas staying; the rooms were flooded; and the goods were spoiled.\r\nThe leader of the small society was thrown into a pool, and, almost\r\nmiraculously, escaped an untimely death. The son of the mayor had been\r\nconverted, and, instead of running away to sea, had joined the society.\r\nHis father was a coward, and had left the town, when he ought to have\r\nremained in it; but his mother sent her maid, begging Charles Wesley\r\nto disguise himself in a woman’s clothes, and endeavour to escape. At\r\nlength, the constable came, beseeching him to leave the town; and poor\r\nMr. Sutton and Mr. Willy began to fear the mob, which they and their\r\nclerical friend Innys had been the means of raising, was becoming more\r\nviolent than might be safe. In the midst of this, Charles Wesley and\r\nMr. Meriton took the opportunity to get away; and, after escaping a\r\nmost murderous attack from a couple of bulldogs, not less savage than\r\nthe bloodthirsty villains which hounded them on, the two martyr like\r\nministers began singing the hymn commencing, “Worship, and thanks, and\r\nblessing;” and thus, in a tone of triumph, made their way to Bath and\r\nBristol.[611]\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, Wesley was accustomed to choose the worst season\r\nof the year for his most trying journey. Why? We cannot tell. Having\r\nfinished his visitation of the London classes, he set out, on the\r\n16th of February, for Newcastle. A north wind blew so hard and keen,\r\nthat, when he and his companions got to Hatfield, they could scarcely\r\nuse either their hands or feet. In making their way to Baldock, they\r\nencountered a storm of snow and hail, which drove so vehemently in\r\ntheir faces, that sight was useless, and breathing almost impossible.\r\nNext day, they had the greatest difficulty in keeping their horses on\r\ntheir feet. The wind rose higher and higher, till it threatened to\r\noverturn both man and beast. A storm of rain and hail drove through\r\ntheir coats, great and small, boots, and everything; and, freezing as\r\nit fell, their eyebrows were hung with icicles. On Stamford Heath, the\r\nsnow was lying in mountain drifts, which sometimes well-nigh swallowed\r\nup both horses and riders; but, about sunset, they came, cold and\r\nweary, to Brigg-Casterton. On the 18th, they were told, so much snow\r\nhad fallen in the night, that travelling was impracticable. Wesley\r\nreplied, “At least, we can walk twenty miles a day, with our horses\r\nin our hands”; and off he set. The north-east wind was piercing; the\r\nmain road was impassable; Wesley was distracted with the toothache;\r\nbut, at five in the afternoon, they arrived at Newark. Next day, they\r\ncame to Epworth, where they rested the three days following; with\r\nthe exception, that, on Sunday Wesley preached twice in the humble\r\nmeeting-house, and once, after the evening prayers, at Epworth cross,\r\nto most of the adult population of the town.\r\n\r\nThe next three days were spent in an excursion to Grimsby and back\r\nagain to Epworth. Charles Wesley had been at the former town seven\r\nweeks before, when the meeting-house was invaded by a mob of wild\r\ncreatures, almost naked, who ran about the place, attacking all they\r\nmet. Several caught at the preacher to drag him down, and one struck\r\nat him. At length, they fell to fighting and beating each other, till,\r\nin a few minutes, they literally drove themselves out of the very\r\nroom from which they meant to drive the poor Methodists; and one of\r\nthe ringleaders, armed with a great club, swore he would conduct the\r\nminister to his lodgings, and forthwith led him through the drunken\r\nrioters to brother Blow’s.[612]\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, when Wesley himself came, “a young gentleman and\r\nhis companions” drowned Wesley’s voice, till a poor woman took up the\r\ncause, and, by keenly and wittily reciting a few passages of the young\r\nspark’s life, turned the laugh of his companions upon him, and obliged\r\nhim to skulk away discomfited. Next day, he came to ask Wesley’s\r\npardon, and thus, for some years, Methodist persecution at Grimsby\r\nceased. At Tetney, Wesley found the most remarkable society in England,\r\nwith Micah Elmoor for its leader. The members were all poor, and yet\r\neach gave from eightpence to two shillings weekly,—certainly a large\r\namount, considering the rate of agricultural wages and the worth of\r\nmoney. The members of the London society were not averaging more than\r\nabout a penny per week. Wesley was surprised at the difference, and\r\nasked, “How is this?” To which Micah Elmoor replied, “All of us, who\r\nare single persons, have agreed together, to give both ourselves and\r\nall we have to God; and, by this means, we are able, from time to time,\r\nto entertain all the strangers that come to Tetney; who often have no\r\nfood to eat, nor any friend to give them lodging.”\r\n\r\nOn February 26, Wesley left Epworth, and proceeded northwards,\r\npreaching, on his way, at Sykehouse, Acomb, Thirsk, and Osmotherley. At\r\nthe last mentioned place, where he had already found a friend in the\r\npopish priest, the clergyman of the parish allowed him to preach twice\r\nin the parish church. “The bitterest gainsayers,” says Wesley, “seemed\r\nnow to be melted into love. All were convinced we are no papists. How\r\nwisely does God order all things in their season!”\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of March, he reached Newcastle. At this period, Grace Murray\r\nhad charge of the Orphan House family. More than once, she had been\r\nan inmate; but she and sister Jackson, like rival queens in the same\r\nestablishment, were unable to agree, and, at least twice, Wesley had\r\nhad the unenviable task of reconciling two gossiping women, whose\r\nreligion made them proud and garrulous, rather than of “a meek and\r\nquiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.” Grace’s\r\nfirst husband was drowned in 1742, upon which she removed from London\r\nto Newcastle, where she was appointed leader of several classes. Within\r\nsix months of her husband’s death, she became the sweetheart of John\r\nBrydon, and it was commonly supposed they were about to marry, but, in\r\nthe long run, Grace declined the honour of John’s alliance. At the end\r\nof 1745, she was made Orphan House keeper, and retained the office at\r\nthe time of Wesley’s visit, in 1747.[613] Unfortunately, we shall have\r\nto recur to sister Murray at a subsequent period.\r\n\r\nAnother inmate was Jeannie Keith, belonging to a respectable family of\r\nthe Keiths in Scotland. Being persecuted on account of her religious\r\nprinciples, she fled to England, and took shelter in Wesley’s Orphan\r\nHouse, where she went by the cognomen of “Holy Mary.” She was\r\nafterwards married to James Bowmaker, a master builder at Alnwick,\r\nwho erected the first Methodist chapel in that town, and was the\r\ngrandfather of the Rev. James Everett. She had two children, and died\r\nabout the year 1752. It has generally been supposed, that Jeannie\r\nKeith fell from grace, this opinion being founded upon an expression\r\nin one of Wesley’s letters, written a year or two previous to her\r\ndeath;[614] but the inference is hardly legitimate, and the thing\r\nitself is incorrect. The writer is possessed of authentic manuscripts,\r\nshowing, that though Jeannie returned to the presbyterian religion, she\r\ncontinued faithful to her great Master to the very last. A year only\r\nbefore her death, she was diligently distributing the works of John and\r\nCharles Wesley among her friends and relatives, including Lord and Lady\r\nSaltoun; and the greatest crime that I can find alleged against her, is\r\nthat of rejoining the church of her childhood. An extract from one of\r\nJeannie’s letters to Wesley, in 1747, may be useful.\r\n\r\n    “I bless God, that ever He brought me into this house. It is\r\n    like a little heaven to me. There is not only such love, but\r\n    such freedom among us, as I could not have believed would have\r\n    been so soon. I have never seen a thing, that I thought amiss\r\n    in any of the family, neither do they seem to think anything\r\n    wrong in me. I am as much entangled with the great ones of the\r\n    world as ever; and if they are not with me, I am with them. I\r\n    have great reasonings, whether to shake off all acquaintance\r\n    with them or not. I am surprised how they bear the plainness\r\n    of speech that I use; for with tears do I tell them the danger\r\n    that their souls are in. Oh! forget not your weak child,\r\n\r\n    “JEANNIE KEITH.”[615]\r\n\r\nIn another letter, dated November 1, 1748, and addressed to Wesley, she\r\nwrites:—\r\n\r\n    “I think we never had a more blessed time in this house, since\r\n    it was a house. I know of nothing amiss betwixt sister Murray\r\n    and me; but we cannot be as one soul; for, you know, she must\r\n    have a little pre-eminence. I am exceeding willing that she\r\n    should; and so we live in great peace, and, I believe, in love.\r\n    I am still unwilling to take anything from anybody. I work out\r\n    of choice, having never yet learned how long a woman can be\r\n    idle and innocent. I do not murmur because I have not worldly\r\n    goods, or a little skin-deep beauty; but I am happy, because,\r\n    as long as God lives, I shall enjoy Him; so long as there is\r\n    a heaven, I shall possess it. If this thought cannot make me\r\n    happy, without anything else, I deserve to be miserable.\r\n\r\n    “Your affectionate and loving child,\r\n    “JEANNIE KEITH.”[616]\r\n\r\nHow many more refugee sisters there were in the Orphan House, we are\r\nnot informed; but we learn from the manuscript already quoted, that,\r\nabout this period, Christopher Hopper, Benjamin Wheatley, Edward\r\nDunstan, and Eleazer Webster, all of them either already or about to\r\nbecome itinerants, were, more or less, Orphan House residents; and\r\nit is probable, that these were some of the young men referred to in\r\nthe extracts following. The Orphan House was, at once, a place of\r\nworship, a school for orphans, a refuge for the injured and oppressed,\r\nthe northern home of Wesley, and the “theological institution” of his\r\npreachers. Wesley writes:—\r\n\r\n    “March 2.—I rode to Newcastle. I found all in the house of\r\n    the same spirit; pouring out their souls to God many times in\r\n    a day together, and breathing nothing but love and brotherly\r\n    kindness.”\r\n\r\n    “March 4.—This week I read over, with some young men, a\r\n    compendium of rhetoric, and a system of ethics. I see not, why\r\n    a man of tolerable understanding may not learn in six months\r\n    more of solid philosophy than is commonly learned at Oxford in\r\n    four (perhaps seven) years.”\r\n\r\nThe old Orphan House was thus the first institution in which young\r\nMethodist preachers received instructions for the efficient discharge\r\nof their ministerial duties. Here Wesley himself studied. During this\r\nvery visit, he read “The Exhortations of Ephraem Syrus,” whose picture\r\nof a broken and contrite heart had never been excelled since the days\r\nof David,—and “The History of the Puritans;” after which he wrote:—“I\r\nstand in amaze: first, at the execrable spirit of persecution which\r\ndrove those venerable men out of the Church, and with which Queen\r\nElizabeth’s clergy were as deeply tinctured as ever Queen Mary’s were;\r\nsecondly, at the weakness of those holy confessors, many of whom spent\r\nso much of their time and strength in disputing about surplices and\r\nhoods, or kneeling at the Lord’s supper.”\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, that, though only little more than four years had\r\nelapsed since the society at Newcastle was founded by Charles Wesley,\r\nit was now reduced from above eight hundred members to four hundred.\r\nWesley, however, considered, according to the old proverb, that “the\r\nhalf was more than the whole”; but if this were true, the whole must\r\nhave been a motley mass.\r\n\r\nHaving spent seven weeks at Newcastle and in the neighbourhood, Wesley\r\nset out, on Easter Monday, April 20, for London. In the evening, he\r\nreached Osmotherley, where, after having ridden, at least, sixty miles,\r\nand preached twice, he mounted a tombstone, and concluded the day by\r\na sermon from “The Lord is risen indeed.” Here John Nelson met him,\r\nhaving just escaped from the hands of his murderous persecutors in the\r\nvicinity of York.\r\n\r\nProceeding to Thirsk, Wesley found the town full of holiday folks,\r\ndrinking, cursing, swearing, and cockfighting. Making his way to\r\nLeeds and other towns in the west riding of Yorkshire, he visited the\r\nMoravian settlement at Fulneck, which was now approaching completion.\r\n“It stands,” says he, “on the side of a hill, commanding all the vale\r\nbeneath, and the opposite hill. The front is exceeding grand, though\r\nplain, being faced with fine, smooth, white stone. The Germans suppose\r\nit will cost about three thousand pounds; it is well if it be not\r\nnearer ten. But that is no concern to the English Brethren; for they\r\nare told, and believe, that all the money will come from beyond the\r\nsea.” We shall find, in a subsequent chapter, that Wesley’s doubts\r\nrespecting the “ways and means” were not unfounded.\r\n\r\nAt Keighley, Wesley ascertained that the small society of ten had\r\nincreased tenfold. He visited Grimshaw, and preached in Haworth\r\nchurch. At Halifax, he addressed “a civil, senseless congregation,”\r\nand baptized a Quaker. Meeting with William Darney, who, besides\r\nconverting Grimshaw, had been the means of forming a number of\r\nsocieties among the mountains of Lancashire and Yorkshire, Wesley,\r\nat his request, set out to visit those infant churches, at Roughlee,\r\nWiddap, Stonesey Gate, and other places. While preaching one morning\r\nat five o’clock, near New Church, in Rossendale, one of his hearers\r\nwas a young man, then in his twentieth year, who afterwards rose to a\r\nhigh position,—John Butterworth, for more than fifty years the pastor\r\nof a Baptist church, the author of a valuable concordance to the Holy\r\nScriptures, and the father of the late Joseph Butterworth, Esq., who\r\nwas long a distinguished Methodist in the metropolis, and a member of\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\nFrom Rossendale, Wesley proceeded to Manchester, where, on the 7th of\r\nMay, he preached at Salford cross. Within the last few months, a few\r\nyoung men had formed themselves into a society, had rented a room,\r\nand written a letter desiring the Wesleys to own them as brethren.\r\nThe “room” was a small apartment in a house built upon a rock on the\r\nbank of the Irwell, on the north side of Blackfriars Bridge, at the\r\nbottom of a large yard, known by the name of the “Rose and Crown\r\nyard,” and which was filled with wood built, thatched cottages. The\r\nhouse, containing the “preaching room” was three storeys high. The\r\nground floor was a joiner’s shop; the rooms in the middle story were\r\nthe residence of a newly married couple; the garret was the “room,”\r\nand was itself also the home of a poor woman, who there plied her\r\nspinning wheel, while her husband, in the same apartment, flung the\r\nshuttle. Christopher Hopper, at one of the Manchester conferences,\r\nreferred to this little meeting-house, and said: “In 1749, I preached\r\nin an old garret, that overhung the river, in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe old bridge. The coals were in one corner of the room, the looms\r\nin another, and I was in danger of breaking my neck in getting up to\r\nit. The congregation consisted of not more than from twenty to thirty\r\npersons.”[617] Such was the cradle of Manchester Methodism, in 1747.\r\nWesley says, “their house would not contain a tenth part of the\r\npeople,”—and hence he went to Salford cross.\r\n\r\nWhile at Manchester, Wesley made his first visit to Boothbank. Here\r\nresided John and Alice Crosse. Alice had been a rude, uncultivated\r\ncreature, but had a dash of the heroine in her constitution. “John\r\nCrosse,” said she, “wilt thou go to heaven with me? If not, I am\r\ndetermined not to go to hell with thee.” Her decision was firm and\r\nfinal, and honest John soon joined her in her journey to the better\r\nland. They now gladly received the servants of God into their dwelling,\r\na pulpit was fixed in their largest room, a society was formed, and\r\nAlice was made leader. Her endeavours to be useful were indefatigable.\r\nCommon beggars were intercepted, warned of their sin and danger, prayed\r\nwith, and then relieved. Gentlemen, who came a-hunting, were run after,\r\nand told, in the plainest terms, the consequences of their sinful\r\ndoings. On her husband being made a constable, (she having far more\r\ncourage than himself) he would send her to the constables’ meetings,\r\nto defend the despised and persecuted Methodists. When disappointed of\r\na preacher, Alice herself would occupy the pulpit, and, with faithful\r\nenergy, declare the truth as it is in Jesus. Though marked with\r\nrusticity, she was, in decision and majesty, a Deborah.[618] “She was,”\r\nsays John Pawson, “one of the most zealous, active, spiritually minded\r\nwomen I ever knew.” She died in 1774, aged sixty-five. Her house, for\r\ngenerations, was the happy home of Methodist itinerants. Up to a few\r\nyears ago, a bootjack, made by John Nelson, at one of his visits,\r\nwas carefully preserved by her descendants living in the same farm\r\ndwelling; and on the panes of glass in the window of what was known as\r\n“the prophet’s chamber,” were not a few inscriptions written by the\r\nbrave hearted evangelists, who there found a warm welcome. Boothbank\r\nwas the loving centre where the first Methodists of Lancashire and\r\nCheshire used to meet, for friendly counsel, and the old farmhouse\r\nwas licensed for preaching before any Methodist chapel was built in\r\nManchester. Five years after this first visit by Wesley, the first\r\nCheshire quarterly meeting was held in the humble dwelling of John\r\nand Alice Crosse, when Chester sent, by Jonathan Pritchard, the sum\r\nof twelve shillings; Bolton, by George Eskrick, eight shillings and\r\ntwopence; Manchester, by Richard Barlow, two pounds three shillings and\r\nfivepence; while Boothbank itself contributed the not insignificant\r\nsum of ten shillings and elevenpence.[619] Wesley’s description of the\r\nBoothbank congregation, at his first visit, is brief but beautiful,—“a\r\nquiet and loving people.”\r\n\r\nLeaving Boothbank, he proceeded to Mr. Anderton’s, near Northwich.\r\nHere he preached, prayed, and talked for more than two hours, his\r\nrustic congregation being intermixed with “several of the gay and\r\nrich.” Many long years elapsed, however, before Methodist preaching\r\nwas established in the town itself, and here, as elsewhere, Methodism\r\nmet with brutal persecution. On one occasion, the preacher was pulled\r\ndown the street by the hair of his head.[620] On another, John Morris\r\nnarrowly escaped being thrown over the bridge into the river.[621]\r\nThe mob, encouraged by two young gents of the names of Barrow and\r\nJeffreys, rejoiced not only in throwing stones, mud, and rotten eggs,\r\nbut in dragging the Methodist itinerants into a quagmire, which divided\r\nthe townships of Northwich and Witton. One of the first Methodists\r\nhere was Isaac Barnes, a seedsman, who was often rolled in the foul\r\nriver, and in other respects made to suffer; but his sister once used\r\na device by which the biters were bitten. While the mob were shouting,\r\nswearing, and throwing stones at the front of her brother’s house, she\r\nquietly heated the poker, and then, letting it cool till its redness\r\nwas removed, she rushed into the street, and pretended to strike the\r\nassembled scamps. One seized the poker, but instantly let it go.\r\nOthers, in quick succession, did the same; and, in a little while,\r\nthe amazon was victorious; by their own act, in seizing the heated\r\npoker, most of the assailants were in burning agony; and the valorous\r\nmob were surprised and scattered. Moses Dale was another of the first\r\nNorthwich Methodists,—a poor and plain, but earnest and honest man,—a\r\nclass-leader and local preacher, who was once carried round the town\r\non a butcher’s block, and then set down in the market place, where the\r\ncrowd with cow horns blew into his ears till he was almost deafened.\r\nMoses was a man of small ability, but a son of thunder. Once a year,\r\nhe made a preaching tour through Derbyshire and Shropshire, and, on\r\none occasion, preached in the vicarage at Madeley, with his hands on\r\nFletcher’s shoulders. “Moses,” said some young swells in a chemist’s\r\nshop, “is it true that you know your sins forgiven?” “I am forbidden\r\nto tell you,” quietly replied Moses. “Who forbids you, Moses?” “Jesus\r\nChrist,” said Moses; “look at Matthew vii. 6.” “Surely, Moses, you\r\ndon’t compare us to swine?” “No,” quoth Moses, “but the Bible does, and\r\nI have no occasion.” Poor Moses died in 1788.\r\n\r\nFrom Northwich, Wesley went to Congleton, and Macclesfield, and\r\nSheffield, and Leeds; and then, turning round, he hurried, by way of\r\nNottingham and Birmingham, to London, which he reached on the 21st of\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nFor the last eight years, Wesley had been shut out of the London\r\nchurches; but now, to one of them, he was again admitted. The Rev.\r\nRichard Thomas Bateman, a man of high birth and great natural\r\nendowments, was rector of St. Bartholomew’s the Great, in Smithfield,\r\nand also held a living in Wales, where he had been converted under\r\nthe powerful ministry of the Rev. Howel Davies.[622] Being converted\r\nhimself, he, at once, with great fervour, began to pray and preach for\r\nthe conversion of others.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Wesley got back to London, Mr. Bateman offered him his\r\npulpit, and the offer was accepted. The church was crowded to excess.\r\nThe churchwardens complained to Bishop Gibson, saying, “My lord, Mr.\r\nBateman, our rector, invites Mr. Wesley very frequently to preach in\r\nhis church.” The bishop replied, “What would you have me do? I have no\r\nright to hinder him. Mr. Wesley is a clergyman, regularly ordained, and\r\nunder no ecclesiastical censure;”[623] and so the matter ended.\r\n\r\nFrom the first, the financial affairs of the London society had been\r\nentrusted to stewards. Hitherto, they had been sixteen in number,\r\nbut Wesley now reduced them to seven, to whom he gave a series of\r\ninstructions how to regulate their behaviour. They were to hold\r\nmeetings every Tuesday and Thursday morning. Every meeting was to\r\nbegin and end with prayer. Once a month, their accounts were to be\r\ntranscribed into the ledger. Each, in turn, was to be chairman for a\r\nmonth. Nothing was to be done without the consent of the minister. They\r\nwere to be deeply serious. Only one was to speak at once, and he only\r\njust loud enough to make himself heard. They were to avoid all clamour\r\nand contention. If they could not relieve the poor who came, they were\r\nnot to grieve them. They were to give them soft words, if nothing else;\r\nand to make them glad to come, even though they had to go away empty. A\r\nsteward breaking any of these rules, after being thrice admonished by\r\nthe chairman, was to be deposed from office.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked whence the stewards obtained their funds. The answer\r\nis, that, for more than forty years, all the money collected in the\r\nLondon classes was put into the hands of these officials, and was\r\ndistributed in relieving the necessities of the poor. Not a shilling\r\nseems to have been spent upon the preachers’ salaries.[624]\r\n\r\nVisiting the sick, and the opening of the dispensary, have been already\r\nnoticed. But, besides these, there were connected with the old Foundery\r\nother expensive and valuable institutions. Two small houses were taken\r\nand fitted up for the reception of needy and deserving widows, for the\r\nsupport of whom the collections at the sacraments and the contributions\r\nof the bands were given. In 1748, Wesley writes: “In this (commonly\r\ncalled the poor-house) we have now nine widows, one blind woman, two\r\npoor children, and two upper servants, a maid and a man. I might add,\r\nfour or five preachers; for I myself, as well as the other preachers\r\nwho are in town, diet with the poor, on the same food, and at the same\r\ntable; and we rejoice herein, as a comfortable earnest of our eating\r\nbread together in our Father’s kingdom.”[625]\r\n\r\nThen there was a school with two masters, and about sixty children,\r\na few of whom paid for their tuition, but the greater part, being\r\nextremely poor, were taught and even clothed gratuitously. The rules\r\nwere characteristic, but some of them exceedingly absurd. No child\r\nwas to be admitted under the age of six. All the children were to\r\nbe present every morning at the five o’clock preaching. The school\r\nhours were from six to twelve, and from one to five. No holidays were\r\ngranted. No child was to speak in school, but to the masters; and any\r\nchild who was absent two days in one week, without leave, was to be\r\nexcluded. The education consisted of reading, writing, and arithmetic.\r\nTwo stewards were appointed to receive subscriptions and to pay\r\nexpenses; and also to pray with and exhort the children twice a week;\r\nand to meet the parents every Wednesday morning, and give them counsels\r\nhow to train their children when at home.[626]\r\n\r\nThen there was a lending society. Observing that people often needed\r\nsmall sums of money, but knew not where to borrow them, Wesley went\r\nfrom one end of London to the other, and, in a few days, begged £50.\r\nThis was lodged in the hands of stewards, who attended every Tuesday\r\nmorning for the purpose of lending to those who wanted any small\r\namount, not exceeding twenty shillings, on condition that the loan\r\nshould be repaid within three months. Wesley writes: “It is almost\r\nincredible, but, with this inconsiderable sum, two hundred and fifty\r\nhave been assisted within the year 1747. Will not God put it into the\r\nheart of some lover of mankind to increase this little stock? If this\r\nis not lending unto the Lord, what is?”[627]\r\n\r\nThe stock was increased. At the commencement of 1748, Wesley made\r\na public collection for the same object, and by this and by other\r\nmeans the capital was raised, in 1767, to £120,[628] after which\r\nthe maximum loan was altered from one pound to five.[629] Hundreds\r\nof the honest poor were greatly assisted by this benevolent device;\r\nand, among others, the well known Lackington, who about the year 1774\r\nwas penniless, but who, by the help of Wesley’s fund, began a book\r\nbusiness, which grew to such immense dimensions, that, eighteen years\r\nafterwards, its annual sales were more than a hundred thousand volumes,\r\nfrom which Lackington, the quondam cobbler, realised the noble income\r\nof £5000 a year.\r\n\r\nSuch were the benevolent institutions connected with the Foundery in\r\n1747. Wesley was often accused of making himself rich. In reply to\r\nthis, in 1748, he sarcastically remarks:—“Some have supposed my revenue\r\nwas no greater than that of the Bishop of London. Others have computed,\r\nthat I receive £800 a year from Yorkshire only. If so, it cannot\r\nbe so little as £10,000 a year which I receive out of all England!\r\nAccordingly, the rector of Redruth extends the calculation pretty\r\nconsiderably. ‘Let me see,’ said he; ‘two millions of Methodists, and\r\neach of these paying twopence a week.’ If so, I must have £860,000,\r\nwith some odd shillings and pence, a year! A tolerable competence! But\r\nbe it more or less, it is nothing at all to me. All that is contributed\r\nor collected, in every place, is both received and expended by others;\r\nnor have I so much as the ‘beholding thereof with my eyes.’ And so it\r\nwill be, till I turn Turk or pagan. For I look upon all this revenue,\r\nbe it what it may, as sacred to God and the poor; out of which, if\r\nI want anything, I am relieved, even as another poor man. So were\r\noriginally all ecclesiastical revenues, as every man of learning knows;\r\nand the bishops and priests used them only as such. If any use them\r\notherwise now, God help them!”[630]\r\n\r\nThe conference of 1747 began on the 15th of June, and ended on the\r\n20th. This was the largest yet held. Six clergymen were present,\r\nnamely, John and Charles Wesley, Charles Manning, Richard Thomas\r\nBateman, Henry Piers, and Vincent Perronet; also Howel Harris; and nine\r\npreachers, John Jones, Thomas Maxfield, Jonathan Reeves, John Nelson,\r\nJohn Bennet, John Downes, Robert Swindells, John Maddern, and Thomas\r\nCrouch, the last mentioned being a local preacher only.[631]\r\n\r\nTwo doctrines were discussed at the conference of 1747; first, whether\r\na Divine assurance of the forgiveness of sins is an essential part\r\nof justifying faith; and secondly, whether entire sanctification is\r\nattainable in the present life. It was inquired, “Is justifying faith\r\na Divine assurance that Christ loved _me_, and gave Himself for _me_?”\r\nAnswer: “We believe it is.”[632] This was unguarded language, and John\r\nWesley soon felt it so. A month later, he seems to have examined the\r\nsubject more closely, and wrote to his brother Charles as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Yesterday I was thinking on a _desideratum_ among us, a\r\n    _genesis problematica_ on justifying faith. A skeleton of it, I\r\n    have roughly set down.\r\n\r\n    “Is justifying faith a sense of pardon? _Negatur._\r\n\r\n    “By justifying faith, I mean, that faith, which whosoever hath\r\n    not is under the wrath and curse of God. By a sense of pardon,\r\n    I mean, a distinct, explicit assurance, that my sins are\r\n    forgiven.\r\n\r\n    “I allow (1) That there is such an explicit assurance. (2) That\r\n    it is the common privilege of real Christians. (3) That it\r\n    is the proper Christian faith, which purifies the heart, and\r\n    overcomes the world.\r\n\r\n    “But I cannot allow, that justifying faith is such an\r\n    assurance, or necessarily connected therewith.\r\n\r\n    “Because, if justifying faith necessarily implies such an\r\n    explicit assurance of pardon, then every one who has it not,\r\n    and every one so long as he has it not, is under the wrath and\r\n    curse of God. But this is a supposition contrary to Scripture\r\n    and to experience (Isa. l. 10, and Acts x. 34).\r\n\r\n    “Again, the assertion, that justifying faith is a sense of\r\n    pardon, is contrary to reason; it is flatly absurd. For how can\r\n    a sense of our having received pardon be the condition of our\r\n    receiving it?\r\n\r\n    “If you object, ‘We know fifteen hundred persons who have\r\n    this assurance.’ Perhaps so, but this does not prove that\r\n    they were not justified till they received it. 2. ‘We have\r\n    been exceedingly blessed in preaching this doctrine.’ We have\r\n    been blessed in preaching the great truths of the gospel;\r\n    although we tacked to them, in the simplicity of our hearts,\r\n    a proposition which was not true. 3. ‘But does not our Church\r\n    give this account of justifying faith?’ I am sure she does of\r\n    saving or Christian faith; I think she does of justifying faith\r\n    too. But to the law and testimony. All men may err: but the\r\n    word of the Lord shall stand for ever.”[633]\r\n\r\nThis seems to clash with Wesley’s previously expressed sentiments, and,\r\nin 1809, there was a somewhat bitter controversy on the subject between\r\nthe Rev. Melville Horne and the Rev. Edward Hare and others. Suffice it\r\nto say here, that the definition of faith in the Church of England’s\r\nhomily on salvation, which Wesley had been wont to quote, was rather\r\na definition of the _habitual_ faith of a justified man, than of the\r\n_act_ by which a sinner is first justified and saved.[634] Wesley held\r\nthis corrected view to the end of life.\r\n\r\nAs it respects the second question raised at the conference of 1747,\r\nit was allowed—(1) That many of those who have died in the faith were\r\nnot made “perfect in love” till a little before death; (2) that the\r\nterm “sanctified” is continually applied by St. Paul to all that are\r\njustified, but that, by this term _alone_, he rarely, if ever, means\r\nsaved from all sin, and consequently, it is improper to use it in such\r\na sense without adding the word “wholly” or “entirely”; and (3) that\r\nthe inspired writers very rarely speak either of, or to those who\r\nare wholly sanctified, and that therefore it behoves us, in public\r\nat least, rarely to speak, in full and explicit terms, concerning\r\nentire sanctification. Having conceded such points (which may sound\r\nstrangely in the ears of some at the present day), the Conference\r\nproceeds to show most conclusively, from numerous texts of Scripture,\r\nthat believers ought to expect to be saved from all sin, previous to\r\ndeath; but exhorts such as have attained to this state of grace not to\r\nspeak of it to those who know not God, nor indeed to any without some\r\nparticular reason, without some particular good in view, and even then\r\nto have an especial care to avoid all appearance of boasting, and to\r\nspeak more loudly and convincingly by their lives, than they can do by\r\ntheir tongues.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the conference sittings were principally occupied\r\nin determining miscellaneous matters. The right of private judgment\r\nwas enforced. All agreed to read, before the next conference, all the\r\ntracts which had been published by Wesley, and to mark every passage\r\nwhich they considered to be wrong or dubious. It was ruled, that the\r\nMethodists were not schismatics, any more than they were rebels or\r\nmurderers. It was agreed that they had been too limited in their field\r\npreaching; and that they had paid “respect to persons,” by devoting\r\nmore of their time to the rich than to the poor, by not speaking to\r\nthem so plain as to the others, and by admitting them into the society\r\nand bands, though they had never received remission of sins, nor met\r\nin any band at all. Precautions were to be employed in keeping from\r\nthe Lord’s table unworthy communicants, first, by exercising more care\r\nin admitting members into the society, and secondly, by giving notes\r\nto none but those who applied for them on the days appointed in each\r\nquarter. Wesley’s “assistants” were now twenty-two in number. The names\r\nof thirty-eight local preachers are given, including a number, who, to\r\nsome extent, were already labouring as itinerants.\r\n\r\nWho can fail to admire the simple, honest earnestness of these early\r\nconclaves of godly Methodists?—men, without preconceived ideas,\r\ndesiring above all things to ascertain what is truth, and to adopt\r\nthe most useful plans in spreading it? “In our first conference,” say\r\nthey, “it was agreed to examine every point from the foundation. Have\r\nwe not been somewhat fearful in doing this? What were we afraid of?\r\nOf overturning our first principles? Whoever was afraid of this, it\r\nwas a vain fear. For if they are true, they will bear the strictest\r\nexamination. If they are false, the sooner they are overturned the\r\nbetter. Let us all pray for a willingness to receive light; an\r\ninvariable desire to know of every doctrine, whether it be of God.” Men\r\nanimated by such a principle were sure to have happy meetings, and were\r\nnot likely to go far astray.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday after the conference ended, Wesley set out for Cornwall.\r\nIt was the eve of a parliamentary election, and, at Exeter, while his\r\nclothes were being dried, he wrote “A Word to a Freeholder;” and,\r\nat St. Ives, so successfully warned the Methodists against bribery,\r\nthat, though sorely tempted, “not one of them would even eat or drink\r\nat the expense of the candidate for whom they voted.” At Plymouth, a\r\nlieutenant with his retinue of soldiers, drummers, and a mob, came to\r\nmake disturbance. At St. Agnes, the rabble threw dirt and clods; and\r\nMr. Shepherd’s horse, taking fright, leaped over a man who was stooping\r\ndown, the poor fellow screaming most lustily, but escaping unhurt.\r\nHere another man, learning that Wesley was about to preach, said, “If\r\nhe does, I’ll stone him,” and forthwith began to fill his pockets with\r\nthe needful missiles. He reached the spot. Wesley took his text, “He\r\nthat is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.”\r\nThe man’s courage failed him, stone after stone stealthily dropped\r\nfrom his well filled pockets, and he went away with the impression\r\nthat the preacher was something wonderful.[635] At Sithney, Wesley met\r\nthe stewards of all the Cornish societies, and found that there were\r\neighteen exhorters in the county; that three of these had no gifts\r\nat all for the work, neither natural nor supernatural; that a fourth\r\nhad neither gifts nor grace, but was a dull, empty, self conceited\r\nman; and that a fifth had considerable gifts, but had evidently made\r\nshipwreck of the grace of God. These, therefore, he set aside, and\r\nadvised the societies not to hear them. The remaining thirteen were\r\nto preach when there was no preacher in their own or the neighbouring\r\nsocieties, provided that they would take no step without the advice of\r\nthose who had more experience than themselves. At Newlyn, where Peter\r\nJaco had been recently converted,[636] some poor wretches of Penzance\r\nbegan cursing and swearing, and thrust Wesley down the bank on which\r\nhe was preaching. At Port Isaac, the mob hallooed and shouted, but\r\nnone except the captain lifted up his hand to strike. At Camelford, a\r\nlarge train attended him, but only one stone struck him. At Terdinny,\r\nthe parson affirmed publicly in his church, that Wesley’s errand was\r\nto obtain a hundred pounds, which must be raised directly. These were\r\nthe unpleasantnesses of his journey; but, upon the whole, his visit\r\nwas happy and successful; and, almost in every place, he found the\r\ngood work prospering, as the following letter to his friend Ebenezer\r\nBlackwell shows:—\r\n\r\n    “ST. IVES, _July 10, 1747_.\r\n\r\n    “DEAR SIR,—A great and effectual door is opened now, almost in\r\n    every corner of this country. There is such a change within\r\n    these two years as has hardly been seen in any other part of\r\n    England. Wherever we went, we used to carry our lives in our\r\n    hands; and now there is not a dog to wag his tongue. Several\r\n    ministers are clearly convinced of the truth; few are bitter;\r\n    most seem to stand neuter. Some of the gentlemen (so called)\r\n    are almost the only opposers now; drinking, revelling, cursing,\r\n    swearing gentlemen, who neither will enter into the kingdom of\r\n    heaven themselves, nor suffer any others, if they can hinder\r\n    it. The most violent Jacobites among these are continually\r\n    crying out that we are bringing the Pretender; and some of\r\n    these worthy men bear his majesty’s commission, as justices of\r\n    the peace.\r\n\r\n    “I am, dear sir,\r\n    “Your affectionate servant,\r\n    “JOHN WESLEY.”[637]\r\n\r\nWesley got back to Bristol on August 1, and, three days afterwards, set\r\nout for Ireland.\r\n\r\nPoor Ireland! Even then, Ireland was England’s greatest difficulty.\r\nA hundred years had elapsed since the bloody rebellion of 1641; and\r\nmore than half a century had passed since King William’s victory at\r\nthe battle of the Boyne. Irish parliaments, during the reign of Anne,\r\nand the first and second Georges, had riveted and extended the penal\r\nlaws against papists. Ireland was in a state of torpid tranquillity—a\r\nslumbering volcano, stirred only by apprehensions of internal\r\ncommotion, or by the agitation of partisan quarrels between the rival\r\nfactions of court and country. The massacre of 1641, and the sanguinary\r\npersecution in the reign of the bigoted James II., were still fresh\r\nin the recollection of Protestants, and heightened their animosity to\r\nthe utmost; while, on the other hand, discomfitures and disasters,\r\npenal laws and legalized oppression, rendered the hatred of the papists\r\nvirulent beyond example. Irritating and maddening circumstances\r\nfomented, on both sides, the most rancorous malignity: protestantism\r\nwas triumphant, and an imperious papacy in a degrading bondage.\r\n\r\nIn England, Moravianism was the pioneer of Methodism; and so it was in\r\nIreland. In 1745, an English soldier in Dublin formed a small society\r\nof pious people, and began to preach to them. Just at this juncture,\r\nBenjamin La Trobe, a young student in connection with the Baptists,\r\nhaving finished his studies at the university of Glasgow, came to\r\nDublin, and became the leader of the little band, gathered together by\r\nthe soldier’s exertions, thirty of whom already belonged to different\r\nreligious churches. In the same year, John Cennick withdrew himself\r\nfrom Whitefield’s connexion, and transferred all the societies that he\r\nhad been the means of forming, to the care of the Moravians, while\r\nhe himself became a Moravian minister. At the request of the society,\r\norganised by the soldier, and now presided over by Benjamin La Trobe,\r\nJohn Cennick came to Dublin in June, 1746, and began to preach in\r\na chapel in Skinner’s Alley, which the society had hired from the\r\nBaptists. The place was soon crowded with hearers, and the society\r\nincreased to about five hundred members.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, Cennick had to attend a Moravian synod in Germany.\r\nDuring his absence, Thomas Williams, one of Wesley’s itinerants, came\r\nto Dublin. Williams was a man of attractive appearance, pleasing\r\nmanners, and good address. Holmes, in his “History of the United\r\nBrethren,” says that Williams prevailed on several members of the\r\nsociety to leave the Moravians and join the Methodists, and we\r\nhave no authority to deny the statement. It may be true, or it may\r\nbe otherwise. Certain it is, that, by some means, Williams formed\r\na separate society, and in a few weeks wrote to Wesley,[638] who\r\ndetermined to visit Ireland without delay. The results of this were\r\nvastly important. Forty-two times Wesley crossed the Irish Channel,\r\nand spent, in his different visits, at least half-a-dozen years of\r\nhis laborious life in the emerald isle. Ireland yielded him some of\r\nthe most eminent of his coadjutors—Thomas Walsh, Adam Clarke, Henry\r\nMoore, and others; and Irishmen were ordained by Providence to found\r\nMethodism, or to aid in founding it, in the North American British\r\nprovinces, in the West Indies, in Africa, in India, and in Australia.\r\n\r\nWesley landed in Dublin Bay on Sunday morning, August 9. His host\r\nwas Mr. Lunell, a banker,[639] who afterwards gave £400 towards the\r\nerection of the Methodist chapel in Whitefriar Street.[640]\r\n\r\nOn the day of his landing, Wesley preached, in St. Mary’s church, to\r\n“as gay and senseless a congregation as he ever saw.” Next morning he\r\nmet Thomas Williams’s society at five; and at six preached in the large\r\nroom, which was not large enough to contain the congregation. He then\r\nwent to Mr. R——, the curate of St. Mary’s, who “professed abundance\r\nof goodwill,” and commended Wesley’s sermon; but “expressed the most\r\nrooted prejudice against lay preachers, or preaching out of a church;\r\nand said, ‘the Archbishop of Dublin was resolved to suffer no such\r\nirregularities in his diocese.’”\r\n\r\nThe day after, Wesley waited on the archbishop; spent above two hours\r\nin conversation with his grace; and answered abundance of objections.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Wesley and John Trembath (who was with him) continued\r\npreaching in a chapel, originally designed for a Lutheran church, which\r\nwould accommodate about four hundred people. This was in Marlborough\r\nStreet,[641] and was crowded with poor and rich, and ministers of every\r\ndenomination. Wesley devoted every morning to an explanation of the\r\nrules of the Methodist societies, and preached twice a day to many more\r\nthan the meeting-house would hold. Four days after his arrival, he\r\nwrote as follows, to his friend Mr. Ebenezer Blackwell:—\r\n\r\n    “I have found a home in this strange land. I am at Mr. Lunell’s\r\n    just as at the Foundery; only, that I have not such attendance\r\n    here; for I meet the people at another part of the town. For\r\n    natural sweetness of temper, for courtesy and hospitality,\r\n    I have never seen any people like the Irish. Indeed, all I\r\n    converse with are only English transplanted into another soil;\r\n    and they are much mended by the removal, having left all their\r\n    roughness and surliness behind them. They receive the word of\r\n    God with all gladness and readiness of mind. The danger is,\r\n    that it should not take deep root, that it should be as seed\r\n    falling on stony ground.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Lunell and his family desire their best respects to Mrs.\r\n    Blackwell and you. His daughter can rejoice in God her Saviour.\r\n    They propose to spend the winter in England.”[642]\r\n\r\nSaturday, August 15, Wesley arranged to see, at Mr. Lunell’s, all who\r\nwished to speak with him. He writes: “I found scarce any Irish among\r\nthem. At least ninety-nine in a hundred of the native Irish remain in\r\nthe religion of their forefathers. The Protestants, whether in Dublin\r\nor elsewhere, are almost all transplanted lately from England. Nor is\r\nit any wonder, that those who are born papists generally live and die\r\nsuch, when the protestants can find no better ways to convert them than\r\npenal laws and acts of parliament.”\r\n\r\nHe ascertained, by personal examination, that the Dublin society,\r\nformed by Williams, consisted of about two hundred and eighty members,\r\n“many of whom appeared to be strong in faith.” Mr. La Trobe, the\r\nMoravian preacher, took alarm; read to his congregation the “Short View\r\nof the Difference between the Moravians,” etc.; and gave utterance to\r\n“bitter words”; but this did service to the Methodists rather than\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nAfter spending exactly a fortnight in Dublin, Wesley returned to\r\nEngland, and was succeeded by his brother Charles, who arrived on\r\nSeptember 9, with Charles Perronet as his companion.\r\n\r\nDuring the fortnight which had elapsed since Wesley left, a mob had\r\nbroken into the Marlborough Street chapel, and destroyed all before\r\nthem; goods of a considerable value had been stolen; the pulpit and\r\nbenches had been burnt openly in the street, and several of the\r\nMethodists beaten with shillalahs. Charles found that a new nickname\r\nhad been given to the poor Methodists. John Cennick, in his zeal\r\nagainst popish idolatry, had said, “I curse and blaspheme all the\r\ngods in heaven, but the Babe that lay in Mary’s lap, the Babe that\r\nlay in swaddling clouts”; and, because of that, the populace called\r\nhim “swaddling John,” and the Methodists “Swaddlers.” The Methodists\r\nwere now without a meeting-house, and Charles Wesley, at the peril\r\nof his life, regularly preached on Oxmanton Green; but, within a\r\nmonth, he bought a house near Dolphin’s Barn, the whole ground floor\r\nof which was a weaver’s workshop.[643] He writes on October 10, to\r\nMr. Blackwell:—“At my first coming here, we were so persecuted, that\r\nno one in Dublin would venture to let us a house or a room; but now\r\ntheir hearts are turned, and we have the offer of several convenient\r\nplaces.”[644] And, in another letter, to his brother, dated October 9,\r\nhe remarks, that he must either buy the house near Dolphin’s Barn, or\r\nget some other lodgings, or take his flight. “_Here_ I can stay no\r\nlonger. A family of squalling children, a landlady just ready to lie\r\nin, a maid who has no time to do the least thing for us, are some of\r\nour inconveniences. Our two rooms for four people allow no opportunity\r\nfor four people. Charles Perronet and I groan for elbow room in our\r\npress-bed; our diet is answerable to our lodgings; we have no one to\r\nmend our clothes and stockings, and no money to buy more.”[645] Under\r\nsuch circumstances, the weaver’s shop was turned into a preaching\r\nhouse, and the rooms above it used as the Dublin home of the two\r\nWesleys and their itinerants. Charles Wesley opened the “New House” on\r\nOctober 25, “by preaching to a great multitude within and without”;\r\nand, though he preached not fewer than five times during the day, and\r\nalso attended a three hours’ service at St. Patrick’s, he “was as\r\nfresh” at night as he was when he commenced his labour in the morning.\r\nThe Dublin society contributed upwards of £70 towards the expenses;\r\nCharles Wesley remained more than six months as their devoted minister;\r\nand Methodism in Ireland was fairly started.[646] Wesley also gave the\r\nIrish Methodists a hymn-book of 336 pages, entitled “Hymns and Sacred\r\nPoems. Dublin: printed in the year 1747.” The hymns were 246 in number,\r\nand embodied much of the Methodist history of the past eight years;\r\nbut, with this brief notice, we must leave them.\r\n\r\nOn his return to England, at the end of August, Wesley made his way\r\nfrom Holyhead to Bristol, preaching in streets, in churchyards, on\r\ntombstones, in meadows, in castle yards, and wherever he had a chance.\r\nAt Cardiff, he found the society filled with vain janglings, by J.\r\nProsser, “an honest, well meaning man; but no more qualified, either by\r\nnature or grace, to expound Scripture, than to read lectures in logic\r\nor algebra.”\r\n\r\nHurrying up to London, which he reached on September 11, he recommenced\r\nhis ministry in Moorfields, and declares, that, excepting that at\r\nWest Street, he knew no congregation in London so serious as this.\r\nHe made brief visits to Shoreham, Newington, and Lewisham, where he\r\nemployed himself in writing. He examined the London classes, “and\r\nevery person severally, touching that bane of religion, evil speaking.”\r\nHe witnessed some happy deaths; among others that of Mrs. Witham, “an\r\neminent pattern of calm boldness for the truth; of simplicity and godly\r\nsincerity; of zeal for God, and for all good works; and of self denial\r\nin every kind.” He advised his preachers, and wrote to one of them as\r\nfollows:—“In public preaching, speak not one word against opinions of\r\nany kind. We are not to fight against notions, but sins. Least of all\r\nshould I advise you once to open your lips against predestination. It\r\nwould do more mischief than you are aware of. Keep to our one point,\r\npresent inward salvation by faith, by the Divine evidence of sins\r\nforgiven.”[647]\r\n\r\nHaving spent eleven weeks in London and its vicinity, he set out, on\r\nNovember 30, for Bristol, calling at Salisbury on his way. Five weeks\r\nbefore, Westley Hall, the base husband of his sister Martha, had\r\ninfamously deserted his wife and family. The following is an _extract_\r\nfrom a letter published in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_.[648] Some parts\r\nof the letter are so grossly filthy that it would be a pollution to\r\ninsert them.\r\n\r\n    “SALISBURY, _October 30, 1747_.\r\n\r\n    “There have been, for some years past, a considerable number\r\n    of Methodists in this city, who were at first collected, and\r\n    have since continued under the guidance of Mr. Hall, as their\r\n    minister. This man, by an uncommon appearance of sanctity,\r\n    joined with indefatigable labour in field and house preaching,\r\n    drew multitudes of the meaner sort, both of Dissenters and\r\n    the Established Church, to attend him. And, though he has\r\n    continually advanced the grossest absurdities, both in his\r\n    preaching and writings, yet he has so bewitched his followers,\r\n    that his words had greater weight with them than the words of\r\n    Christ and His apostles.\r\n\r\n    “Many sober and judicious persons have often expressed their\r\n    fears, that the nocturnal meetings held at his house were\r\n    scenes of debauchery; for, now and then, a bastard child was\r\n    brought into the world by some of his female devotees.... Last\r\n    Wednesday, he took formal leave of his corrupted flock, and had\r\n    the impudence to justify his infamous conduct from the case\r\n    of Elkanah (1 Sam. i. 1, 2), which he largely expounded. On\r\n    Friday morning he set out for London, having first stripped his\r\n    wife (a virtuous woman by whom he has had several children) of\r\n    all her childbed linen, and whatever he could readily convert\r\n    into money, leaving her in the deepest distress. The fire of\r\n    jealousy has broken out in many families, where _wives_ or\r\n    _daughters_ were his followers.”\r\n\r\nWesley reached the desolate home of his poor sister on December 1, and\r\nwrote:—\r\n\r\n    “From the concurring accounts of many witnesses, who spoke no\r\n    more than they personally knew, I now learned as much as is\r\n    hitherto brought to light concerning the fall of poor Mr. Hall.\r\n    Twelve years ago, he was, without question, filled with faith\r\n    and the love of God. He was a pattern of humility, meekness,\r\n    seriousness, and above all, of self denial; so that in all\r\n    England I knew not his fellow. It were easy to point out the\r\n    several steps, whereby he fell from his steadfastness; even\r\n    till he fell into a course of adultery, yea, and avowed it in\r\n    the face of the sun!”\r\n\r\nWesley spent two days with his unhappy sister, and then says: “I\r\ntook my leave of this uncomfortable place, and set out for Bristol.”\r\nTwo months later, he returned to Salisbury to see the poor miserable\r\nwretch; but he was refused admittance, and his sister also was shut out\r\nof doors.\r\n\r\nNothing now remains, except to notice Wesley’s publications during\r\n1747. The Dublin hymn-book has been mentioned. The others were the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n1. “A Word to a Protestant.” 12mo, 16 pages.\r\n\r\n2. “A Word to a Freeholder.” 12mo, four pages. This, as already stated,\r\nwas written at Exeter, while halting on a journey, and on the eve of a\r\nparliamentary election.\r\n\r\n3. “A Letter to the Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of London;\r\noccasioned by his lordship’s late charge to his clergy.” 12mo, 32\r\npages. Wesley replies to the bishop’s accusations, and concludes thus:—\r\n\r\n    “Our one aim is, to proselyte sinners to repentance. If this be\r\n    not done, we will stand condemned; not as well meaning fools,\r\n    but as devils incarnate; but if it be, then, my lord, neither\r\n    you nor any man beside, can oppose and fortify people against\r\n    us, without being found even to fight against God. There are,\r\n    in and near Moorfields, ten thousand poor souls, for whom\r\n    Christ died, rushing headlong into hell. Is Dr. Bulkeley, the\r\n    parochial minister, both willing and able to stop them? If so,\r\n    let it be done, and I have no place in these parts. I go, and\r\n    call other sinners to repentance. But if, after all that he\r\n    has done, and all he can do, they are still in the broad way\r\n    to destruction, let me see if God will put a word even in my\r\n    mouth. My lord, the time is short. I am past the noon of life.\r\n    Your lordship is old and full of days, having passed the usual\r\n    age of man.[649] It cannot therefore be long before we shall\r\n    both stand naked before God. Will you then rejoice in your\r\n    success in opposing our doctrine? The Lord God grant it may not\r\n    be said in that hour, ‘These have perished in their iniquity;\r\n    but their blood I require at thy hands.’—I am, your lordship’s\r\n    dutiful son and servant,\r\n\r\n    “JOHN WESLEY.”\r\n\r\nAppended to the letter is a magnificent hymn, of nine twelve lined\r\nstanzas, expressive of a calm and firm determination still to\r\npersevere, at all hazards, in preaching the gospel of his great\r\nMaster.[650]\r\n\r\n4. “Lessons for Children.” Part II., 12mo, 108 pages. The lessons are\r\nfifty-four in number, and consist of Scripture selections, from the\r\ntime of the Israelites passing over Jordan to the reign of Hezekiah.\r\n\r\n5. “Primitive Physic; or an easy and natural Method of curing most\r\nDiseases.” 12mo, 119 pages. The publication of this remarkable book\r\narose out of the great success of Wesley’s dispensary, opened in 1746.\r\nAt the time of his death, it had reached its twenty-third edition.[651]\r\nIt has often been ridiculed; but perhaps unwisely. The Rev. Samuel\r\nRomilly Hall remarks:—“A medical gentleman of Leeds, reputed as\r\neminently intelligent and skilful in his profession, has declared\r\nto me, that the unfriendly criticisms, so freely given on Wesley’s\r\n‘Primitive Physic,’ are altogether unwarrantable. He affirms, that,\r\njudged of in comparison with other non-professional works of the same\r\nclass, and of the same date, the ‘Primitive Physic’ is incomparably\r\nsuperior to anything that he knows.”[652]\r\n\r\nBesides, those who laugh at Wesley’s “Primitive Physic” ought to\r\nremember:—(1) At no remote period from Wesley’s day, it was not unusual\r\nfor Christian ministers to practise medicine. (2) Wesley says, “For six\r\nand twenty years, I had made anatomy and physic the diversion of my\r\nleisure hours.” (3) Wesley was not a quack. “I took,” says he, “into my\r\nassistance an apothecary, and an experienced surgeon.”\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable incident, that the medical profession, so generally\r\nimpatient of medical empirics, allowed Wesley’s work to circulate for\r\nnearly thirty years before any of their honourable fraternity deigned\r\nto notice or denounce it. In 1776, an octavo pamphlet of 83 pages\r\nwas published with the following title:—“An Examination of the Rev.\r\nMr. John Wesley’s Primitive Physic; showing that a great number of\r\nthe prescriptions therein contained are founded on ignorance of the\r\nmedical art, and of the power and operations of medicine; and, that\r\nit is a publication calculated to do essential injury to the health\r\nof those persons who may place confidence in it. By W. Hawes, M.D.”\r\nOf the medical merits of this production we have no ability to judge.\r\nIn many instances, it is in the highest degree ironical; though its\r\nauthor affirms, he was totally unknown to Wesley, and had no personal\r\nanimosity against him. Dr. Hawes was unquestionably a man of great\r\neminence in his profession; but he is chiefly known as the founder of\r\nthe Humane Society, thirty of whose managers and directors attended his\r\nfuneral in 1808.\r\n\r\nBefore closing the present chapter of Wesley’s history, it must be\r\nadded, that, about the same time that his “Primitive Physic” was\r\ngiven to the public, he also issued a small pamphlet, at the price of\r\ntwopence, entitled “Receipts for the Use of the Poor”; but as these\r\nwere extracted from the former publication no further notice is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] These statistics have been compiled by the author, who has\r\ncarefully examined the plans of all the English circuits for the year\r\n1864.\r\n\r\n[2] Horace Mann’s “Census.”\r\n\r\n[3] _Methodist Magazine_, 1856, p. 335.\r\n\r\n[4] Stevens’ “Centenary of American Methodism.”\r\n\r\n[5] To prevent confusion, the reader is reminded that in 1751 the old\r\nEnglish calendar was set aside, and that introduced by Pope Gregory\r\nXIII., in 1582, substituted in its place. This was done by act of\r\nParliament for the purpose of harmonizing the computation of time\r\nin England with that of the rest of Europe. In consequence of this\r\nalteration, the anniversary of Wesley’s birth, since 1752, has been,\r\nnot the 17th, but the 28th of June.\r\n\r\n[6] See Crowther’s “Portraiture of Methodism.”\r\n\r\n[7] Clarke’s “Wesley Family,” vol. ii., p. 321.\r\n\r\n[8] Benson’s “Apology,” p. 1.\r\n\r\n[9] Wesley’s Works, vol. i., p. 92.\r\n\r\n[10] Moore’s Life of Wesley, vol. i., p. 116.\r\n\r\n[11] The following is a memorandum in Wesley’s own handwriting:—“Joan.\r\nWestley ad nominat. ducis de Bucks admiss. in fundat.

Moore, by “An Old\r\nMember of Society.”\r\n\r\n[13] Andrew Tooke was only usher of the school during Wesley’s\r\nresidence. The master was Dr. Thomas Walker. Tooke succeeded to the\r\nmastership at Walker’s death, in 1728.

S. Wesley,” p. 251.\r\n\r\n[20] Moore’s Life of Wesley, vol. i., p. 117.\r\n\r\n[21] A story is told by the Rev. John Reynolds, in his “Anecdotes\r\nof Wesley,” p. 8, to the effect that Wesley was deeply moved while\r\nat Oxford, by an odd interview which he had with the porter of his\r\ncollege. This man late one evening went to the young collegian’s room,\r\nand said he wished to talk with him. After a little pleasantry, Wesley\r\ntold him to go home and get another coat. The porter replied, “This\r\nis the only coat I have in the world, and I thank God for it.” Wesley\r\nsaid, “Go home, and get your supper.” The man responded, “I have had\r\nnothing to-day but a drink of water, and I thank God for that.” Wesley\r\nremarked, “It is late, and you will be locked out, and then what will\r\nyou have to thank God for?” “I will thank Him,” replied the porter,\r\n“that I have the dry stones to lie upon.” “John,” said Wesley, “you\r\nthank God when you have nothing to wear, nothing to eat, and no bed\r\nto lie upon. What else do you thank Him for?” “I thank Him,” returned\r\nthe poor fellow, “that He has given me life and being; and a heart to\r\nlove Him, and a desire to serve Him.” Reynolds says this was related\r\nby Wesley himself, and that the interview made a lasting impression on\r\nWesley’s mind, and convinced him there was something in religion to\r\nwhich he was as yet a stranger.\r\n\r\n[22] _Wesleyan Times_, Jan. 29, 1866.\r\n\r\n[23] Wesley’s Works, vol. iii., p. 382.\r\n\r\n[24] Wesley’s Works, vol i., p. 341.\r\n\r\n[25] Moore’s Life of Wesley, vol i., p. 118.\r\n\r\n[26] “Life and Times of S.

Suffice it to say, that he became one of the\r\nprincipal Moravians in England; and that it was by his exertions\r\n_mainly_ that the Moravian missions in North America were taken under\r\ngovernment protection. He was often contemptuously spoken of as\r\n“the deaf old Moravian”: but he was a scholar and a gentleman; had\r\nintercourse with persons of the highest rank; and was a frequent and\r\nalmost familiar visitor of George III. and his Queen Charlotte. For\r\nmany years, his difficulty of hearing was such that he could converse\r\nonly by the use of an ear trumpet; but his face was always lit up with\r\nintellect, and his life was spent in doing good. He died in 1795.\r\n\r\n[140] _Wesley Banner_, 1852, p. 351.\r\n\r\n[141] _Evening Post_, Oct. 14, 1735.\r\n\r\n[142] _Gentleman’s Magazine_, 1733, p. 384.\r\n\r\n[143] “Account of the Sufferings of the Persecuted Protestants in the\r\nArchbishoprick of Saltzburg.” London: 1733.\r\n\r\n[144] Wright’s Memoir of Oglethorpe, p. 77.\r\n\r\n[145] _Methodist Magazine_, 1844, p. 920.\r\n\r\n[146] “Reasons for Establishing the Colony of Georgia.” London: 1733.\r\n\r\n[147] Wesley’s Works, vol. xii., p. 35.\r\n\r\n[148] Priestley’s Letters, p. 56.\r\n\r\n[149] Wesley’s Works, vol. i., p. 16, and vol. viii., p. 471.\r\n\r\n[150] Ingham manuscripts.\r\n\r\n[151] Manuscripts.\r\n\r\n[152] Francis Moore, who sailed in the _Simmonds_, became keeper of the\r\nstores in Georgia, and in 1744 published an account of his voyage; and\r\nrelates, as its principal incidents, that a boy fell overboard, but was\r\nrescued by a rope; in the Downs, a servant was set on shore because he\r\nhad the itch; the passengers had prayers twice a day; Wesley and his\r\nfriends expounded the Scriptures and catechized the children, and ate\r\nat Oglethorpe’s table; the Germans sung psalms, and served God in their\r\nown way; and the only person punished during the voyage was a boy for\r\nstealing turnips.\r\n\r\n[153] Ingham’s Journal.\r\n\r\n[154] Ibid.\r\n\r\n[155] Ingham’s Journal.\r\n\r\n[156] Moore’s Life of Wesley, vol. i., p. 256.\r\n\r\n[157] Ibid. p. 259.\r\n\r\n[158] Ingham’s Journal.\r\n\r\n[159] The _Old Whig_, June 17, 1736.\r\n\r\n[160] _Gentleman’s Magazine_, 1736.\r\n\r\n[161] “New Voyage to Georgia,” 2nd edit., 1737.\r\n\r\n[162] “A Voyage to Georgia,” by F.

Ten years later, John Garvin tried to\r\ncollect a society; but the attempt was a failure. The South Carolina\r\nConference, held in 1806, appointed Samuel Dunwody, and he succeeded in\r\nforming the first Methodist society in Savannah since the breaking up\r\nof that formed by Wesley seventy years previously. Dunwody’s society\r\nconsisted of twelve members, five of them white and seven coloured.\r\nAfter hard toiling a chapel was erected in Savannah in 1812, and was\r\nopened by Bishop Asbury; but, to the present day, the opposition to\r\nMethodism is most decided, and the Methodist society and congregation\r\nare extremely poor and meagre. (See Dr. Dixon’s “Methodism in America,”\r\np. 282.)\r\n\r\n[222] It is right to add that Mr. Stephens, the trustees’ secretary,\r\nwho, upon the whole, evinces a friendly spirit towards Wesley, gives a\r\nsomewhat scurvy character of Wesley’s companions. One of them, Coates,\r\na constable, had been one of the principal fomenters of mischief,\r\na busy fellow, going from house to house with idle stories to fill\r\npeople’s heads with jealousies, and distinguishing himself by a most\r\ninveterate opposition to all the rules of government. He was greatly in\r\ndebt, and had never improved one foot of land since his arrival in the\r\nprovince. Gough, a tithingman, was an idle fellow, pert and impudent\r\nin his behaviour, always kicking against the civil power, and making\r\nit his business to inflame sedition. He also was in debt; and left\r\nbehind him a wife and child, who scarce grieved at his departure, for\r\nhe used to beat them more than feed them. Campbell, a barber, was an\r\ninsignificant loose fellow, fit for any leader that would make a tool\r\nof him, and whose only motive for going off was to escape his creditors.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that this is true; but it by no means follows\r\nthat these vagabonds were Wesley’s _friends_. They seem to have been\r\n_fugitives_ as well as he. Misfortune makes a man acquainted with\r\nstrange bedfellows; still, leaving in such company was an ugly fact,\r\nand was used to Wesley’s disadvantage. Mr. Stephens writes: “As I\r\nwas always ready and willing, in conversation or otherwise, to make\r\nallowance for Mr. Wesley’s failings in policy, and was careful not\r\nto run hastily into a belief of all I heard against him, I was now\r\nasked, in a sneering way, what my sentiments were of him? ‘_Noscitur ex\r\nsociis_’ was the common byword; and all I had to say was that he must\r\nstand or fall by himself, when his cause came before the trustees.”\r\n\r\n[223] See Wesley’s Works, vol. i., p. 76; and Errata to vol. xxvi. of\r\nhis collected works, published in 1774.\r\n\r\n[224] Wesley’s Works, vol. vii., p. 190.\r\n\r\n[225] Moore’s Life of Wesley, vol. i., p. 320.\r\n\r\n[226] Whitefield’s Journal.\r\n\r\n[227] Moore’s Life of Wesley, vol. i., p. 347.\r\n\r\n[228] Whitefield’s journal and letters.\r\n\r\n[229] _Gentleman’s Magazine_, 1738.\r\n\r\n[230] Wesley’s Works, vol. v., p. 18.\r\n\r\n[231] Wesley’s Works, vol. v., p. 18.\r\n\r\n[232] See original letter, _Methodist Magazine_, 1846, p. 1089.\r\n\r\n[233] Wesley’s Works, vol. i., p. 22.\r\n\r\n[234] Ibid. vol vii., p. 189.\r\n\r\n[235] Wesley’s Works, vol. i., p. 95.\r\n\r\n[236] Wesley’s Works, vol. i., pp. 86, 96.\r\n\r\n[237] Wesley’s Works, vol. i., p. 86; and C.

It was pretended\r\nthat a friendly society desired him to preach for the benefit of their\r\nfunds; but the treasurer of the society, and four of its six trustees,\r\nsigned and published a document contradicting this assertion. Of the\r\ntwo remaining, one was from home at the time, and the other was a Mr.\r\nBennett, who assisted the crowd in pushing Whitefield into the pulpit.\r\nThere can be little doubt that Whitefield was deceived by Bennett, and\r\nthat it was a mistake for him to preach at St. Margaret’s when he did.\r\nIn the same weekly journal, it is asserted that Charles Wesley had been\r\nguilty of the same illegal act, by taking possession of the pulpit\r\nat Bloomsbury. His friends asked the pulpit for him; the request was\r\nrefused; and yet he came into the preacher’s pew; sat next the door;\r\nand, as soon as prayers were over, went into the pulpit and preached,\r\nto the great surprise of the clergyman, who intended to preach himself.\r\nWe have no means of either confirming or refuting this.\r\n\r\n[273] His congregation, including horses and coaches, covered three\r\nacres (_Gentleman’s Magazine_, 1739).\r\n\r\n[274] Whitefield’s Journal.\r\n\r\n[275] Ibid.\r\n\r\n[276] Whitefield’s Journal.\r\n\r\n[277] Ibid.\r\n\r\n[278] C. Wesley’s Journal.\r\n\r\n[279] This is worth noting. Wesley, in his History of England, vol.\r\niv., p. 188, tells us that “a severe frost began at Christmas, and\r\ncontinued till the latter end of February. The Thames was covered with\r\nsuch a crust of ice that a multitude of people dwelled upon it in\r\ntents, and a great number of booths were erected for the entertainment\r\nof the populace. The navigation was entirely stopped; the fruits of the\r\nearth were destroyed; many persons were chilled to death; the price of\r\nall sorts of provisions rose almost to a dearth; and even water was\r\nsold in the streets of London.”\r\n\r\n[280] Whitefield’s Journal.\r\n\r\n[281] Whitefield’s Journal.\r\n\r\n[282] Whitefield’s Journal.\r\n\r\n[283] Wesley’s Works, vol. viii., p. 240.\r\n\r\n[284] Ibid. vol. viii., p. 109.\r\n\r\n[285] Taylor’s “Wesley and Methodism.”\r\n\r\n[286] Hutton’s Memoirs, p. 42.\r\n\r\n[287] Wesley’s Works, vol. xiii., p. 292.\r\n\r\n[288] Wesley’s Works, vol. xi., p. 472.\r\n\r\n[289] In the same year, Trapp preached another sermon, On Religious\r\nZeal, before the Oxford university, and the judges presiding at\r\nthe Oxford assizes.

Hence the following, taken from a sermon published\r\nby Annesley in 1661:—“There are believers of several growths in the\r\nchurch of God: fathers, young men, children, and babes; and as, in most\r\nfamilies, there are more babes and children than grown men, so in the\r\nchurch of God there are more weak, doubting Christians, than strong\r\nones, grown up to a full assurance. A babe may be born and yet not know\r\nit; so a man may be born again, and not be sure of it. Sometimes they\r\nthink they have grounds of hope, that they shall be saved; sometimes\r\nthey think they have grounds of fears, that they shall be condemned.\r\nNot knowing which might be most weighty, like a pair of balances, they\r\nare in equipoise.”\r\n\r\n[337] Clarke’s “Wesley Family,” vol. ii., p. 119.\r\n\r\n[338] Priestley’s Letters, p. 108.\r\n\r\n[339] Priestley’s Letters, p. 96.\r\n\r\n[340] Wesley’s Works, vol. xi., p. 355.\r\n\r\n[341] Wesley’s Works, vol. i., p. 331.\r\n\r\n[342] Robert Ramsey did not long escape the hand of justice. About the\r\nChristmas of the year following, he was arrested for another crime,\r\ntried and condemned to die; and on January 14, 1741, with eleven other\r\nmalefactors, was executed at Tyburn. While lying under sentence of\r\ndeath in Newgate prison, he requested Wesley to visit him; and twice\r\nhis old master went, but was refused admittance.

We have compared it\r\nwith “A Dialogue between the Baptist and Presbyterian; wherein the\r\nPresbyterians are punished, by their own pens, for their cruel and\r\nself-devouring doctrines, making God the ordainer of all the sins of\r\nmen and devils, and reprobating the greatest part of mankind without\r\nany help of salvation. By Thomas Grantham, Messenger of the Baptized\r\nChurches in Lincolnshire.

This was not\r\naltogether novel. Nearly a hundred years previously, under the auspices\r\nof Nicholas Pavillon, the Bishop of Alet, in the south of France, there\r\nhad sprung up “The Society of Regents,” one of whose meetings was for\r\nexhortation and free spiritual conversation, and in which each person,\r\nwho was so inclined, related her experience, or asked advice.

The book, as a whole, is well\r\nwritten, and useful; but the last chapter is exceedingly objectionable.\r\nIt unmistakably teaches apostolical succession, confession, priestly\r\nabsolution, and other favourite dogmas of the high church party of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n[458] Doddridge’s Correspondence, vol. iv., p. 86.\r\n\r\n[459] _Methodist Magazine_, 1801, p. 531.\r\n\r\n[460] _Methodist Magazine_, 1808, p. 138.\r\n\r\n[461] Bourne’s and Brand’s histories of Newcastle.\r\n\r\n[462] Manuscripts.\r\n\r\n[463] _Methodist Magazine_, 1848, p. 91.\r\n\r\n[464] Wesley’s Works, vol. xii., p. 84.\r\n\r\n[465] _Methodist Magazine_, 1778, p. 184.\r\n\r\n[466] _Methodist Magazine_, 1778, p. 185.\r\n\r\n[467] Ibid. 1846, p. 362.\r\n\r\n[468] Jackson’s Life of C.

Its title was, “A Letter to the Rev. Mr.\r\nJohn Wesley, in vindication of the Doctrines of absolute, unconditional\r\nElection, particular Redemption, special Vocation, and final\r\nPerseverance. Occasioned chiefly by some things in his Dialogue between\r\na Presbyterian and his Friend; and in his Hymns on God’s Everlasting\r\nLove.”\r\n\r\n[477] _Weekly History_, No. 78: Oct. 2, 1742.\r\n\r\n[478] Since the above was written, we have met with one of Wesley’s\r\nletters, in Rawlinson’s Continuation of Wood’s “Athenæ Oxoniensis,”\r\nin which he states that he published, “An Abridgment of Mr.\r\nNorris’s Christian Prudence, and Reflections on the Conduct of our\r\nUnderstanding,” in 1734.\r\n\r\n[479] _Methodist Magazine_, 1866, p. 324.\r\n\r\n[480] Ibid.\r\n\r\n[481] Wesley’s Works, vol. viii., p. 306.\r\n\r\n[482] Mr. Tucker was vicar of All Saints, Bristol. This pamphlet\r\n(octavo, fifty-one pages) was written at the request of the Archbishop\r\nof Armagh, and was entitled, “A Brief History of the Principles of\r\nMethodism.”\r\n\r\n[483] Wesley also published “Hymns and Poems” in 1742; but as his\r\npoetical publications were chiefly written by his brother, they will be\r\nonly occasionally noticed hereafter.

Another, in\r\n1746, with the title, “Truth defended and cleared from mistakes and\r\nmisrepresentations.” 12mo, 52 pages. In both of these productions,\r\nCudworth shows great ability, and though his opinions, as there\r\nexpressed, are far from orthodox, yet, unless other facts can be\r\nalleged against him, he hardly deserves the hard things which Wesley\r\nsaid of him.\r\n\r\n[567] “Life and Times of Countess of Huntingdon,” vol. ii., p. 338.\r\n\r\n[568] Wesley’s Works, vol. viii., p. 335.\r\n\r\n[569] Ibid. vol. xii., p. 245.\r\n\r\n[570] An old Methodist, Jenny Meek, who knew Wesley well, told the\r\nwriter that the baptism of this energetic sister took place, not in the\r\npopish chapel, but in an adjoining house.
