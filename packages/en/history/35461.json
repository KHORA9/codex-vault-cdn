What happened before that time was\r\na matter of legend and speculation.  Over a large part of the civilized\r\nworld it was believed and taught that the world had been created\r\nsuddenly in 4004 B.C., though authorities differed as to whether this\r\nhad occurred in the spring or autumn of that year. This fantastically\r\nprecise misconception was based upon a too literal interpretation of\r\nthe Hebrew Bible, and upon rather arbitrary theological assumptions\r\nconnected therewith.  Such ideas have long since been abandoned by\r\nreligious teachers, and it is universally recognized that the universe\r\nin which we live has to all appearances existed for an enormous period\r\nof time and possibly for endless time.  Of course there may be\r\ndeception in these appearances, as a room may be made to seem endless\r\nby putting mirrors facing each other at either end. But that the\r\nuniverse in which we live has existed only for six or seven thousand\r\nyears may be regarded as an altogether exploded idea.\r\n\r\nThe earth, as everybody knows nowadays, is a spheroid, a sphere\r\nslightly compressed, orange fashion, with a diameter of nearly 8,000\r\nmiles.  Its spherical shape has been known at least to a limited number\r\nof intelligent people for nearly 2,500 years, but before that time it\r\nwas supposed to be flat, and various ideas which now seem fantastic\r\nwere entertained about its relations to the sky and the stars and\r\nplanets.  We know now that it rotates upon its axis (which is about 24\r\nmiles shorter than its equatorial diameter) every twenty-four hours,\r\nand that this is the cause of the alternations of day and night, that\r\nit circles about the sun in a slightly distorted and slowly variable\r\noval path in a year. Its distance from the sun varies between\r\nninety-one and a half millions at its nearest and ninety-four and a\r\nhalf million miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUMINOUS SPIRAL CLOUDS OF MATTER\r\n“LUMINOUS SPIRAL CLOUDS OF MATTER”\r\n\r\n(Nebula photographed 1910)\r\n\r\n_Photo: G. W. Ritchey_\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the earth circles a smaller sphere, the moon, at an average\r\ndistance  of 239,000 miles. Earth and moon are not the only bodies to\r\ntravel round  the sun.  There are also the planets, Mercury and Venus,\r\nat distances of  thirty-six and sixty-seven millions of miles; and\r\nbeyond the circle of the  earth and disregarding a belt of numerous\r\nsmaller bodies, the planetoids,  there are Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,\r\nUranus and Neptune at mean distances of 141, 483, 886, 1,782, and 1,793\r\nmillions of miles respectively. These figures in millions of miles are\r\nvery difficult for the mind to grasp.  It may help the reader’s\r\nimagination if we reduce the sun and planets to a smaller, more\r\nconceivable scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEBULA SEEN EDGE ON\r\nTHE NEBULA SEEN EDGE-ON\r\n\r\nNote the central core which, through millions of years, is cooling to\r\nsolidity\r\n\r\n_Photo: G. W. Ritchey_\r\n\r\n\r\nIf, then, we represent our earth as a little ball of one inch diameter,\r\n the sun would be a big globe nine feet across and 323 yards away, that\r\n is about a fifth of a mile, four or five minutes’ walking.  The  moon\r\nwould be a small pea two feet and a half from the world.  Between earth\r\nand sun there would be the two inner planets, Mercury and Venus,  at\r\ndistances of one hundred and twenty-five and two hundred and fifty \r\nyards from the sun. All round and about these bodies there would be \r\nemptiness until you came to Mars, a hundred and seventy-five feet\r\nbeyond the earth; Jupiter nearly a mile away, a foot in diameter;\r\nSaturn, a little smaller, two miles off; Uranus four miles off and\r\nNeptune six miles off. Then nothingness and nothingness except for\r\nsmall particles and drifting scraps of attenuated vapour for thousands\r\nof miles.  The nearest star to earth on this scale would be 40,000\r\nmiles away.\r\n\r\nThese figures will serve perhaps to give one some conception of the\r\nimmense emptiness of space in which the drama of life goes on.\r\n\r\nFor in all this enormous vacancy of space we know certainly of life\r\nonly  upon the surface of our earth. It does not penetrate much more\r\nthan three miles down into the 4,000 miles that separate us from the\r\ncentre of our globe, and it does not reach more than five miles above\r\nits surface.  Apparently all the limitlessness of space is otherwise\r\nempty and dead.\r\n\r\nThe deepest ocean dredgings go down to five miles. The highest recorded\r\nflight of an aeroplane is little more than four miles. Men have reached\r\nto seven miles up in balloons, but at a cost of great suffering.  No\r\nbird can fly so high as five miles, and small birds and insects which\r\nhave been carried up by aeroplanes drop off insensible far below that\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nTHE WORLD IN TIME\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last fifty years there has been much very fine and interesting\r\nspeculation on the part of scientific men upon the age and origin of\r\nour earth. Here we cannot pretend to give even a summary of such\r\nspeculations because they involve the most subtle mathematical and\r\nphysical considerations. The truth is that the physical and\r\nastronomical sciences are still too undeveloped as yet to make anything\r\nof the sort more than an illustrative guesswork. The general tendency\r\nhas been to make the estimated age of our globe longer and longer. It\r\nnow seems probable that the earth has had an independent existence as a\r\nspinning planet flying round and round the sun for a longer period than\r\n2,000,000,000 years. It may have been much longer than that. This is a\r\nlength of time that absolutely overpowers the imagination.\r\n\r\nBefore that vast period of separate existence, the sun and earth and\r\nthe other planets that circulate round the sun may have been a great\r\nswirl of diffused matter in space.  The telescope reveals to us in\r\nvarious parts of the heavens luminous spiral clouds of matter, the\r\nspiral nebulæ, which appear to be in rotation about a centre. It is\r\nsupposed by many astronomers that the sun and its planets were once\r\nsuch a spiral, and that their matter has undergone concentration into\r\nits present form. Through majestic æons that concentration went on\r\nuntil in that vast remoteness of the past for which we have given\r\nfigures, the world and its moon were distinguishable.  They were\r\nspinning then much faster than they are spinning now; they were at a\r\nlesser distance from the sun; they travelled round it very much faster,\r\nand they were probably incandescent or molten at the surface.  The sun\r\nitself was a much greater blaze in the heavens.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT SPIRAL NEBULA\r\nTHE GREAT SPIRAL NEBULA\r\n\r\n_Photo: G. W. Ritchey_\r\n\r\nIf we could go back through that infinitude of time and see the earth\r\nin this earlier stage of its history, we should behold a scene more\r\nlike the interior of a blast furnace or the surface of a lava flow\r\nbefore it cools and cakes over than any other contemporary scene.  No\r\nwater would be visible because all the water there was would still be\r\nsuperheated steam in a stormy atmosphere of sulphurous and metallic\r\nvapours.  Beneath this would swirl and boil an ocean of molten rock\r\nsubstance.  Across a sky of fiery clouds the glare of the hurrying sun\r\nand moon would sweep swiftly like hot breaths of flame.\r\n\r\nA DARK NEBULA\r\nA DARK NEBULA\r\n_Taken in 1920 with the aid of the largest telescope in the world. One\r\nof the first photographs taken by the Mount Wilson telescope._\r\n\r\nThere are dark nebulæ and bright nebulæ.  Prof. Henry Norris Russell,\r\nagainst the British theory, holds that the dark nebulæ preceded the\r\nbright nebulæ.\r\n\r\n_Photo: Prof. Hale_\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly by degrees as one million of years followed another, this fiery\r\nscene would lose its eruptive incandescence.  The vapours in the sky\r\nwould rain down and become less dense overhead; great slaggy cakes of\r\nsolidifying rock would appear upon the surface of the molten sea, and\r\nsink under it, to be replaced by other floating masses.  The sun and\r\nmoon growing now each more distant and each smaller, would rush with\r\ndiminishing swiftness across the heavens. The moon now, because of its\r\nsmaller size, would be already cooled far below incandescence, and\r\nwould be alternately obstructing and reflecting the sunlight in a\r\nseries of eclipses and full moons.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER SPIRAL NEBULA\r\nANOTHER SPIRAL NEBULA\r\n\r\n_Photo: G. W. Ritchey_\r\n\r\nAnd so with a tremendous slowness through the vastness of time, the\r\nearth would grow more and more like the earth on which we live, until\r\nat last an age would come when, in the cooling air, steam would begin\r\nto condense into clouds, and the first rain would fall hissing upon the\r\nfirst rocks below.  For endless millenia the greater part of the\r\nearth’s water would still be vaporized in the atmosphere, but there\r\nwould now be hot streams running over the crystallizing rocks below and\r\npools and lakes into which these streams would be carrying detritus and\r\ndepositing sediment.\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDSCAPE BEFORE LIFE\r\nLANDSCAPE BEFORE LIFE\r\n“Great lava-like masses of rock without traces of soil”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last a condition of things must have been attained in which a man\r\nmight have stood up on earth and looked about him and lived. If we\r\ncould have visited the earth at that time we should have stood on great\r\nlava-like masses of rock without a trace of soil or touch of living\r\nvegetation, under a storm-rent sky.  Hot and violent winds, exceeding\r\nthe fiercest tornado that ever blows, and downpours of rain such as our\r\nmilder, slower earth to-day knows nothing of, might have assailed us. \r\nThe water of the downpour would have rushed by us, muddy with the\r\nspoils of the rocks, coming together into torrents, cutting deep gorges\r\nand canyons as they hurried past to deposit their sediment in the\r\nearliest seas.  Through the clouds we should have glimpsed a great sun\r\nmoving visibly across the sky, and in its wake and in the wake of the\r\nmoon would have come a diurnal tide of earthquake and upheaval. And\r\n\r\nthe moon, which nowadays keeps one constant face to earth, would then\r\nhave been rotating visibly and showing the side it now hides so\r\ninexorably.\r\n\r\nThe earth aged.  One million years followed another, and the day\r\nlengthened, the sun grew more distant and milder, the moon’s pace in\r\nthe sky slackened; the intensity of rain and storm diminished and the\r\nwater in the first seas increased and ran together into the ocean\r\ngarment our planet henceforth wore.\r\n\r\nBut there was no life as yet upon the earth; the seas were lifeless,\r\nand the rocks were barren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nTHE BEGINNINGS OF LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs everybody knows nowadays, the knowledge we possess of life before\r\nthe beginnings of human memory and tradition is derived from the\r\nmarkings and fossils of living things in the stratified rocks. We find\r\npreserved in shale and slate, limestone, and sandstone, bones, shells,\r\nfibres, stems, fruits, footmarks, scratchings and the like, side by\r\nside with the ripple marks of the earliest tides and the pittings of\r\nthe earliest rain-falls. It is by the sedulous examination of this\r\nRecord of the Rocks that the past history of the earth’s life has been\r\npieced together.  That much nearly everybody knows to-day.  The\r\nsedimentary rocks do not lie neatly stratum above stratum; they have\r\nbeen crumpled, bent, thrust about, distorted and mixed together like\r\nthe leaves of a library that has been repeatedly looted and burnt, and\r\nit is only as a result of many devoted lifetimes of work that the\r\nrecord has been put into order and read.  The whole compass of time\r\nrepresented by the record of the rocks is now estimated as\r\n1,600,000,000 years.\r\n\r\nThe earliest rocks in the record are called by geologists the Azoic\r\nrocks, because they show no traces of life.  Great areas of these Azoic\r\nrocks lie uncovered in North America, and they are of such a thickness\r\nthat geologists consider that they represent a period of at least half\r\nof the 1,600,000,000 which they assign to the whole geological record. \r\nLet me repeat this profoundly significant fact. Half the great interval\r\nof time since land and sea were first distinguishable on earth has left\r\nus no traces of life.  There are ripplings and rain marks still to be\r\nfound in these rocks, but no marks nor vestiges of any living thing.\r\n\r\nMARINE LIFE IN THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD\r\nMARINE LIFE IN THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD\r\n1 and 8, Jellyfishes;  2, Hyolithes (swimming snail);  3, Humenocaris; \r\n4, Protospongia; 5, Lampshells (Obolella);  6, Orthoceras;  7,\r\nTrilobite (Paradoxides) — see fossil on page 13; 9, Coral\r\n(Archæocyathus);  10, Bryograptus;  11, Trilobite (Olenellus); 12,\r\nPalesterina\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, as we come up the record, signs of past life appear and increase.\r\n The age of the world’s history in which we find these past traces is\r\ncalled by geologists the Lower Palæozoic age. The first indications\r\nthat life was astir are vestiges of comparatively simple and lowly\r\nthings: the shells of small shellfish, the stems and flowerlike heads\r\nof zoophytes, seaweeds and the tracks and remains of sea worms and\r\ncrustacea.  Very early appear certain creatures rather like plant-lice,\r\ncrawling creatures which could roll themselves up into balls as the\r\nplant-lice do, the trilobites.  Later by a few million years or so come\r\ncertain sea scorpions, more mobile and powerful creatures than the\r\nworld had ever seen before.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL TRILOBITE (SLIGHTLY MAGNIFIED)\r\nFOSSIL TRILOBITE (SLIGHTLY MAGNIFIED)\r\n_Photo: John J. Ward, F.E.S._\r\n\r\n\r\nNone of these creatures were of very great size.  Among the largest\r\nwere certain of the sea scorpions, which measured nine feet in length. \r\nThere are no signs whatever of land life of any sort, plant or animal;\r\nthere are no fishes nor any vertebrated creatures in this part of the\r\nrecord.  Essentially all the plants and creatures which have left us\r\ntheir traces from this period of the earth’s history are shallow-water\r\nand intertidal beings.  If we wished to parallel the flora and fauna of\r\nthe Lower Palæozoic rocks on the earth to-day, we should do it best,\r\nexcept in the matter of size, by taking a drop of water from a rock\r\npool or scummy ditch and examining it under a microscope.  The little\r\ncrustacea, the small shellfish, the zoophytes and algæ we should find\r\nthere would display a quite striking resemblance to these clumsier,\r\nlarger prototypes that once were the crown of life upon our planet.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY PALÆOLITHIC FOSSILS OF VARIOUS SPECIES OF LINGULA\r\nEARLY PALÆOLITHIC FOSSILS OF VARIOUS SPECIES OF LINGULA\r\n\r\nSpecies of this most ancient genus of shellfish still live to-day\r\n\r\n_(In Natural History Museum, London)_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well, however, to bear in mind that the Lower Palæozoic rocks\r\nprobably do not give us anything at all representative of the first\r\nbeginnings of life on our planet. Unless a creature has bones or other\r\nhard parts, unless it wears a shell or is big enough and heavy enough\r\nto make characteristic footprints and trails in mud, it is unlikely to\r\nleave any fossilized traces of its existence behind.  To-day there are\r\nhundreds of thousands of species of small soft-bodied creatures in our\r\nworld which it is inconceivable can ever leave any mark for future\r\ngeologists to discover.  In the world’s past, millions of millions of\r\nspecies of such creatures may have lived and multiplied and flourished\r\nand passed away without a trace remaining.  The waters of the warm and\r\nshallow lakes and seas of the so-called Azoic period may have teemed\r\nwith an infinite variety of lowly, jelly-like, shell-less and boneless\r\ncreatures, and a multitude of green scummy plants may have spread over\r\nthe sunlit intertidal rocks and beaches.  The Record of the Rocks is no\r\nmore a complete record of life in the past than the books of a bank are\r\na record of the existence of everybody in the neighbourhood.  It is\r\nonly when a species begins to secrete a shell or a spicule or a\r\ncarapace or a lime-supported stem, and so put by something for the\r\nfuture, that it goes upon the Record.  But in rocks of an age prior to\r\nthose which bear any fossil traces, graphite, a form of uncombined\r\ncarbon, is sometimes found, and some authorities consider that it may\r\nhave been separated out from combination through the vital activities\r\nof unknown living things.\r\n\r\n\r\n FOSSILIZED FOOTPRINTS OF A LABYRINTHODONT CHEIROTHERIUM\r\nFOSSILIZED FOOTPRINTS OF A LABYRINTHODONT CHEIROTHERIUM\r\n\r\n_(In Natural History Museum, London)_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nTHE AGE OF FISHES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the days when the world was supposed to have endured for only a few\r\nthousand years, it was supposed that the different species of plants\r\nand animals were fixed and final; they had all been created exactly as\r\nthey are to-day, each species by itself.  But as men began to discover\r\nand study the Record of the Rocks this belief gave place to the\r\nsuspicion that many species had changed and developed slowly through\r\nthe course of ages, and this again expanded into a belief in what is\r\ncalled Organic Evolution, a belief that all species of life upon earth,\r\nanimal and vegetable alike, are descended by slow continuous processes\r\nof change from some very simple ancestral form of life, some almost\r\nstructureless living substance, far back in the so-called Azoic seas.\r\n\r\nThis question of Organic Evolution, like the question of the age of the\r\nearth, has in the past been the subject of much bitter controversy. \r\nThere was a time when a belief in organic evolution was for rather\r\nobscure reasons supposed to be incompatible with sound Christian,\r\nJewish and Moslem doctrine.  That time has passed, and the men of the\r\nmost orthodox Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Mohammedan belief are\r\nnow free to accept this newer and broader view of a common origin of\r\nall living things.  No life seems to have happened suddenly upon earth.\r\n Life grew and grows.  Age by age through gulfs of time at which\r\nimagination reels, life has been growing from a mere stirring in the\r\nintertidal slime towards freedom, power and consciousness.\r\n\r\nLife consists of individuals. These individuals are definite things,\r\nthey are not like the lumps and masses, nor even the limitless and\r\nmotionless crystals, of non-living matter, and they have two\r\ncharacteristics no dead matter possesses.  They can assimilate other\r\nmatter into themselves and make it part of themselves, and they can\r\nreproduce themselves.  They eat and they breed.  They can give rise to\r\nother individuals, for the most part like themselves, but always also a\r\nlittle different from themselves.  There is a specific and family\r\nresemblance between an individual and its offspring, and there is an\r\nindividual difference between every parent and every offspring it\r\nproduces, and this is true in every species and at every stage of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIMEN OF THE PTERICHTHYS MILLERI OR SEA SCORPION SHOWING BODY ARMOUR\r\nSPECIMEN OF THE PTERICHTHYS MILLERI OR SEA SCORPION SHOWING BODY ARMOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nNow scientific men are not able to explain to us either why offspring\r\nshould resemble nor why they should differ from their parents.  But\r\nseeing that offspring do at once resemble and differ, it is a matter\r\nrather of common sense than of scientific knowledge that, if the\r\nconditions under which a species live are changed, the species should\r\nundergo some correlated changes.  Because in any generation of the\r\nspecies there must be a number of individuals whose individual\r\ndifferences make them better adapted to the new conditions under which\r\nthe species has to live, and a number whose individuals whose\r\nindividual differences make it rather harder for them to live.  And on\r\nthe whole the former sort will live longer, bear more offspring, and\r\nreproduce themselves more abundantly than the latter, and so generation\r\nby generation the average of the species will change in the favourable\r\ndirection.  This process, which is called Natural Selection, is not so\r\nmuch a scientific theory as a necessary deduction from the facts of\r\nreproduction and individual difference.  There may be many forces at\r\nwork varying, destroying and preserving species, about which science\r\nmay still be unaware or undecided, but the man who can deny the\r\noperation of this process of natural selection upon life since its\r\nbeginning must be either ignorant of the elementary facts of life or\r\nincapable of ordinary thought.\r\n\r\nMany scientific men have speculated about the first beginning of life\r\nand their speculations are often of great interest, but there is\r\nabsolutely no definite knowledge and no convincing guess yet of the way\r\nin which life began.  But nearly all authorities are agreed that it\r\nprobably began upon mud or sand in warm sunlit shallow brackish water,\r\nand that it spread up the beaches to the intertidal lines and out to\r\nthe open waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL OF THE CLADOSELACHE, A DEVONIAN SHARK\r\nFOSSIL OF THE CLADOSELACHE, A DEVONIAN SHARK\r\n\r\n_Nat. Hist. Mus._\r\n\r\n\r\nThat early world was a world of strong tides and currents.  An\r\nincessant destruction of individuals must have been going on through\r\ntheir being swept up the beaches and dried, or by their being swept out\r\nto sea and sinking down out of reach of air and sun.  Early conditions\r\nfavoured the development of every tendency to root and hold on, every\r\ntendency to form an outer skin and casing to protect the stranded\r\nindividual from immediate desiccation.  From the very earliest any\r\ntendency to sensitiveness to taste would turn the individual in the\r\ndirection of food, and any sensitiveness to light would assist it to\r\nstruggle back out of the darkness of the sea deeps and caverns or to\r\nwriggle back out of the excessive glare of the dangerous shallows.\r\n\r\nProbably the first shells and body armour of living things were\r\nprotections against drying rather than against active enemies. But\r\ntooth and claw come early into our earthly history.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted the size of the earlier water scorpions.  For\r\nlong ages such creatures were the supreme lords of life. Then in a\r\ndivision of these Palæozoic rocks called the Silurian division, which\r\nmany geologists now suppose to be as old as five hundred million years,\r\nthere appears a new type of being, equipped with eyes and teeth and\r\nswimming powers of an altogether more powerful kind.  These were the\r\nfirst known backboned animals, the earliest fishes, the first known\r\nVertebrata.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHARKS AND GANOIDS OF THE DEVONIAN PERIOD\r\nSHARKS AND GANOIDS OF THE DEVONIAN PERIOD\r\n\r\n_By Alice Woodward_\r\n\r\n\r\nThese fishes increase greatly in the next division of rocks, the rocks\r\nknown as the Devonian system.  They are so prevalent that this period\r\nof the Record of the Rocks has been called the Age of Fishes.  Fishes\r\nof a pattern now gone from the earth, and fishes allied to the sharks\r\nand sturgeons of to-day, rushed through the waters, leapt in the air,\r\nbrowsed among the seaweeds, pursued and preyed upon one another, and\r\ngave a new liveliness to the waters of the world. None of these were\r\nexcessively big by our present standards.  Few of them were more than\r\ntwo or three feet long, but there were exceptional forms which were as\r\nlong as twenty feet.\r\n\r\nWe know nothing from geology of the ancestors of these fishes.  They do\r\nnot appear to be related to any of the forms that preceded them.\r\nZoologists have the most interesting views of their ancestry, but these\r\nthey derive from the study of the development of the eggs of their\r\nstill living relations, and from other sources.  Apparently the\r\nancestors of the vertebrata were soft-bodied and perhaps quite small\r\nswimming creatures who began first to develop hard parts as teeth round\r\nand about their mouths.  The teeth of a skate or dogfish cover the roof\r\nand floor of its mouth and pass at the lip into the flattened toothlike\r\nscales that encase most of its body. As the fishes develop these teeth\r\nscales in the geological record, they swim out of the hidden darkness\r\nof the past into the light, the first vertebrated animals visible in\r\nthe record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\nTHE AGE OF THE COAL SWAMPS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe land during this Age of Fishes was apparently quite lifeless. Crags\r\nand uplands of barren rock lay under the sun and rain. There was no\r\nreal soil—for as yet there were no earthworms which help to make a\r\nsoil, and no plants to break up the rock particles into mould; there\r\nwas no trace of moss or lichen. Life was still only in the sea.\r\n\r\nOver this world of barren rock played great changes of climate. The\r\ncauses of these changes of climate were very complex and they have\r\nstill to be properly estimated.  The changing shape of the earth’s\r\norbit, the gradual shifting of the poles of rotation, changes in the\r\nshapes of the continents, probably even fluctuations in the warmth of\r\nthe sun, now conspired to plunge great areas of the earth’s surface\r\ninto long periods of cold and ice and now again for millions of years\r\nspread a warm or equable climate over this planet.  There seem to have\r\nbeen phases of great internal activity in the world’s history, when in\r\nthe course of a few million years accumulated upthrusts would break out\r\nin lines of volcanic eruption and upheaval and rearrange the mountain\r\nand continental outlines of the globe, increasing the depth of the sea\r\nand the height of the mountains and exaggerating the extremes of\r\nclimate.  And these would be followed by vast ages of comparative\r\nquiescence, when frost, rain and river would wear down the mountain\r\nheights and carry great masses of silt to fill and raise the sea\r\nbottoms and spread the seas, ever shallower and wider, over more and\r\nmore of the land.  There have been “high and deep” ages in the world’s\r\nhistory and “low and level” ages.  The reader must dismiss from his\r\nmind any idea that the surface of the earth has been growing steadily\r\ncooler since its crust grew solid.  After that much cooling had been\r\nachieved, the internal temperature ceased to affect surface conditions.\r\nThere are traces of periods of superabundant ice and snow, of “Glacial\r\nAges,” that is, even in the Azoic period.\r\n\r\nIt was only towards the close of the Age of Fishes, in a period of\r\nextensive shallow seas and lagoons, that life spread itself out in any\r\neffectual way from the waters on to the land.  No doubt the earlier\r\ntypes of the forms that now begin to appear in great abundance had\r\nalready been developing in a rare and obscure manner for many scores of\r\nmillions of years.  But now came their opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CARBONIFEROUS SWAMP\r\nA CARBONIFEROUS SWAMP\r\n\r\n_A Coal Seam in the Making_\r\n\r\n\r\nPlants no doubt preceded animal forms in this invasion of the land, but\r\nthe animals probably followed up the plant emigration very closely. The\r\nfirst problem that the plant had to solve was the problem of some\r\nsustaining stiff support to hold up its fronds to the sunlight when the\r\nbuoyant water was withdrawn; the second was the problem of getting\r\nwater from the swampy ground below to the tissues of the plant, now\r\nthat it was no longer close at hand.  The two problems were solved by\r\nthe development of woody tissue which both sustained the plant and\r\nacted as water carrier to the leaves.  The Record of the Rocks is\r\nsuddenly crowded by a vast variety of woody swamp plants, many of them\r\nof great size, big tree mosses, tree ferns, gigantic horsetails and the\r\nlike.  And with these, age by age, there crawled out of the water a\r\ngreat variety of animal forms. There were centipedes and millipedes;\r\nthere were the first primitive insects; there were creatures related to\r\nthe ancient king crabs and sea scorpions which became the earliest\r\nspiders and land scorpions, and presently there were vertebrated\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKULL OF A LABYRINTHODONT, CAPITOSAURUS\r\nSKULL OF A LABYRINTHODONT, CAPITOSAURUS\r\n\r\n_Nat. Hist. Mus._\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the earlier insects were very large. There were dragon flies in\r\nthis period with wings that spread out to twenty-nine inches.\r\n\r\nIn various ways these new orders and genera had adapted themselves to\r\nbreathing air.  Hitherto all animals had breathed air dissolved in\r\nwater, and that indeed is what all animals still have to do. But now in\r\ndivers fashions the animal kingdom was acquiring the power of supplying\r\nits own moisture where it was needed.  A man with a perfectly dry lung\r\nwould suffocate to-day; his lung surfaces must be moist in order that\r\nair may pass through them into his blood.  The adaptation to air\r\nbreathing consists in all cases either in the development of a cover to\r\nthe old-fashioned gills to stop evaporation, or in the development of\r\ntubes or other new breathing organs lying deep inside the body and\r\nmoistened by a watery secretion.  The old gills with which the\r\nancestral fish of the vertebrated line had breathed were inadaptable to\r\nbreathing upon land, and in the case of this division of the animal\r\nkingdom it is the swimming bladder of the fish which becomes a new,\r\ndeep-seated breathing organ, the lung.  The kind of animals known as\r\namphibia, the frogs and newts of to-day, begin their lives in the water\r\nand breathe by gills; and subsequently the lung, developing in the same\r\nway as the swimming bladder of many fishes do, as a baglike outgrowth\r\nfrom the throat, takes over the business of breathing, the animal comes\r\nout on land, and the gills dwindle and the gill slits disappear.  (All\r\nexcept an outgrowth of one gill slit, which becomes the passage of the\r\near and ear-drum.)  The animal can now live only in the air, but it\r\nmust return at least to the edge of the water to lay its eggs and\r\nreproduce its kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKELETON OF A LABYRINTHODONT: THE ERYOPS\r\nSKELETON OF A LABYRINTHODONT: THE ERYOPS\r\n\r\n_Nat. Hist. Mus._\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the air-breathing vertebrata of this age of swamps and plants\r\nbelonged to the class amphibia.  They were nearly all of them forms\r\nrelated to the newts of to-day, and some of them attained a\r\nconsiderable size.  They were land animals, it is true, but they were\r\nland animals needing to live in and near moist and swampy places, and\r\nall the great trees of this period were equally amphibious in their\r\nhabits.  None of them had yet developed fruits and seeds of a kind that\r\ncould fall on land and develop with the help only of such moisture as\r\ndew and rain could bring.  They all had to shed their spores in water,\r\nit would seem, if they were to germinate.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most beautiful interests of that beautiful science,\r\ncomparative anatomy, to trace the complex and wonderful adaptations of\r\nliving things to the necessities of existence in air.  All living\r\nthings, plants and animals alike, are primarily water things.  For\r\nexample all the higher vertebrated animals above the fishes, up to and\r\nincluding man, pass through a stage in their development in the egg or\r\nbefore birth in which they have gill slits which are obliterated before\r\nthe young emerge.  The bare, water-washed eye of the fish is protected\r\nin the higher forms from drying up by eyelids and glands which secrete\r\nmoisture.  The weaker sound vibrations of air necessitate an ear-drum. \r\nIn nearly every organ of the body similar modifications and adaptations\r\nare to be detected, similar patchings-up to meet aerial conditions.\r\n\r\nThis Carboniferous age, this age of the amphibia, was an age of life in\r\nthe swamps and lagoons and on the low banks among these waters. Thus\r\nfar life had now extended.  The hills and high lands were still quite\r\nbarren and lifeless.  Life had learnt to breathe air indeed, but it\r\nstill had its roots in its native water; it still had to return to the\r\nwater to reproduce its kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\nTHE AGE OF REPTILES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe abundant life of the Carboniferous period was succeeded by a vast\r\ncycle of dry and bitter ages.  They are represented in the Record of\r\nthe Rocks by thick deposits of sandstones and the like, in which\r\nfossils are comparatively few. The temperature of the world fluctuated\r\nwidely, and there were long periods of glacial cold. Over great areas\r\nthe former profusion of swamp vegetation ceased, and, overlaid by these\r\nnewer deposits, it began that process of compression and mineralization\r\nthat gave the world most of the coal deposits of to-day.\r\n\r\nBut it is during periods of change that life undergoes its most rapid\r\nmodifications, and under hardship that it learns its hardest lessons. \r\nAs conditions revert towards warmth and moisture again we find a new\r\nseries of animal and plant forms established,  We find in the record\r\nthe remains of vertebrated animals that laid eggs which, instead of\r\nhatching out tadpoles which needed to live for a time in water, carried\r\non their development before hatching to a stage so nearly like the\r\nadult form that the young could live in air from the first moment of\r\nindependent existence.  Gills had been cut out altogether, and the gill\r\nslits only appeared as an embryonic phase.\r\n\r\nThese new creatures without a tadpole stage were the Reptiles.\r\nConcurrently there had been a development of seed-bearing trees, which\r\ncould spread their seed, independently of swamp or lakes. There were\r\nnow palmlike cycads and many tropical conifers, though as yet there\r\nwere no flowering plants and no grasses.  There was a great number of\r\nferns.  And there was now also an increased variety of insects.  There\r\nwere beetles, though bees and butterflies had yet to come.  But all the\r\nfundamental forms of a new real land fauna and flora had been laid down\r\nduring these vast ages of severity.  This new land life needed only the\r\nopportunity of favourable conditions to flourish and prevail.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FOSSIL ICHTHYOSAURUS, A MESOZOIC FISH-LIZARD\r\nA FOSSIL ICHTHYOSAURUS, A MESOZOIC FISH-LIZARD\r\n\r\nFound in the Lower Lias in Somersetshire\r\n\r\n_Nat. Hist. Mus._\r\n\r\n\r\nAge by age and with abundant fluctuations that mitigation came.  The\r\nstill incalculable movements of the earth’s crust, the changes in its\r\norbit, the increase and diminution of the mutual inclination of orbit\r\nand pole, worked together to produce a great spell of widely diffused\r\nwarm conditions.  The period lasted altogether, it is now supposed,\r\nupwards of two hundred million years.  It is called the Mesozoic\r\nperiod, to distinguish it from the altogether vaster Palæozoic and\r\nAzoic periods (together fourteen hundred millions) that preceded it,\r\nand from the Cainozoic or new life period that intervened between its\r\nclose and the present time, and it is also called the Age of Reptiles\r\nbecause of the astonishing predominance and variety of this form of\r\nlife.  It came to an end some eighty million  years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the world to-day the genera of Reptiles are comparatively few and\r\ntheir distribution is very limited.  They are more various, it is true,\r\nthan are the few surviving members of the order of the amphibia which\r\nonce in the Carboniferous period ruled the world.  We still have the\r\nsnakes, the turtles and tortoises (the Chelonia), the alligators and\r\ncrocodiles, and the lizards.  Without exception they are creatures\r\nrequiring warmth all the year round; they cannot stand exposure to\r\ncold, and it is probable that all the reptilian beings of the Mesozoic\r\nsuffered under the same limitation.  It was a hothouse fauna, living\r\namidst a hothouse flora.  It endured no frosts.  But the world had at\r\nleast attained a real dry land fauna and flora as distinguished from\r\nthe mud and swamp fauna and flora of the previous heyday of life upon\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PTERODACTYL\r\nA PTERODACTYL\r\n\r\n_Nat. Hist. Mus._\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the sorts of reptile we know now were much more abundantly\r\nrepresented then, great turtles and tortoises, big crocodiles and many\r\nlizards and snakes, but in addition there was a number of series of\r\nwonderful creatures that have now vanished altogether from the earth. \r\nThere was a vast variety of beings called the Dinosaurs. Vegetation was\r\nnow spreading over the lower levels of the world, reeds, brakes of fern\r\nand the like; and browsing upon this abundance came a multitude of\r\nherbivorous reptiles, which increased in size as the Mesozoic period\r\nrose to its climax.  Some of these beasts exceeded in size any other\r\nland animals that have ever lived; they were as large as whales.  The\r\n_Diplodocus Carnegii_ for example measured eighty-four feet from snout\r\nto tail; the Gigantosaurus was even greater; it measured a hundred\r\nfeet.  Living upon these monsters was a swarm of carnivorous Dinosaurs\r\nof a corresponding size.  One of these, the Tyrannosaurus, is figured\r\nand described in many books as the last word in reptilian\r\nfrightfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BIG SWAMP-INHABITING DINOSAUR, THE DIPLODOCUS, OVER EIGHTY FEET FROM\r\nSNOUT TO TAIL-TIP\r\nA BIG SWAMP-INHABITING DINOSAUR, THE DIPLODOCUS, OVER EIGHTY FEET FROM\r\nSNOUT TO TAIL-TIP\r\n\r\n_Nat. Hist. Mus._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these great creatures pastured and pursued amidst the fronds and\r\nevergreens of the Mesozoic jungles, another now vanished tribe of\r\nreptiles, with a bat-like development of the fore limbs, pursued\r\ninsects and one another, first leapt and parachuted and presently flew\r\namidst the fronds and branches of the forest trees.  These were the\r\nPterodactyls. These were the first flying creatures with backbones;\r\nthey mark a new achievement in the growing powers of vertebrated life.\r\n\r\nMoreover some of the reptiles were returning to the sea waters. Three\r\ngroups of big swimming beings had invaded the sea from which their\r\nancestors had come: the Mososaurs, the Plesiosaurs, and Ichthyosaurs. \r\nSome of these again approached the proportions of our present whales. \r\nThe Ichthyosaurs seem to have been quite seagoing creatures, but the\r\nPlesiosaurs were a type of animal that has no cognate form to-day.  The\r\nbody was stout and big with paddles, adapted either for swimming or\r\ncrawling through marshes, or along the bottom of shallow waters.  The\r\ncomparatively small head was poised on a vast snake of neck, altogether\r\noutdoing the neck of the swan. Either the Plesiosaur swam and searched\r\nfor food under the water and fed as the swan will do, or it lurked\r\nunder water and snatched at passing fish or beast.\r\n\r\nSuch was the predominant land life throughout the Mesozoic age.  It was\r\nby our human standards an advance upon anything that had preceded it. \r\nIt had produced land animals greater in size, range, power and\r\nactivity, more “vital” as people say, than anything the world had seen\r\nbefore.  In the seas there had been no such advance but a great\r\nproliferation of new forms of life.  An enormous variety of squid-like\r\ncreatures with chambered shells, for the most part coiled, had appeared\r\nin the shallow seas, the Ammonites.  They had had predecessors in the\r\nPalæozoic seas, but now was their age of glory.  To-day they have left\r\nno survivors at all; their nearest relation is the pearly Nautilus, an\r\ninhabitant of tropical waters.  And a new and more prolific type of\r\nfish with lighter, finer scales than the plate-like and tooth-like\r\ncoverings that had hitherto prevailed, became and has since remained\r\npredominant in the seas and rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\nTHE FIRST BIRDS AND THE FIRST MAMMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a few paragraphs a picture of the lush vegetation and swarming\r\nreptiles of that first great summer of life, the Mesozoic period, has\r\nbeen sketched.  But while the Dinosaurs lorded it over the hot selvas\r\nand marshy plains and the Pterodactyls filled the forests with their\r\nflutterings and possibly with shrieks and croakings as they pursued the\r\nhumming insect life of the still flowerless shrubs and trees, some less\r\nconspicuous and less abundant forms upon the margins of this abounding\r\nlife were acquiring certain powers and learning certain lessons of\r\nendurance, that were to be of the utmost value to their race when at\r\nlast the smiling generosity of sun and earth began to fade.\r\n\r\nA group of tribes and genera of hopping reptiles, small creatures of\r\nthe dinosaur type, seem to have been pushed by competition and the\r\npursuit of their enemies towards the alternatives of extinction or\r\nadaptation to colder conditions in the higher hills or by the sea.\r\nAmong these distressed tribes there was developed a new type of\r\nscale—scales that were elongated into quill-like forms and that\r\npresently branched into the crude beginnings of feathers. These\r\nquill-like scales layover one another and formed a heat-retaining\r\ncovering more efficient than any reptilian covering that had hitherto\r\nexisted.  So they permitted an invasion of colder regions that were\r\notherwise uninhabited.  Perhaps simultaneously with these changes there\r\narose in these creatures a greater solicitude for their eggs.  Most\r\nreptiles are apparently quite careless about their eggs, which are left\r\nfor sun and season to hatch.  But some of the varieties upon this new\r\nbranch of the tree of life were acquiring a habit of guarding their\r\neggs and keeping them warm with the warmth of their bodies.\r\n\r\nWith these adaptations to cold other internal modifications were going\r\non that made these creatures, the primitive birds, warm-blooded and\r\nindependent of basking.  The very earliest birds seem to have been\r\nseabirds living upon fish, and their fore limbs were not wings but\r\npaddles rather after the penguin type.  That peculiarly primitive bird,\r\nthe New Zealand Ki-Wi, has feathers of a very simple sort, and neither\r\nflies nor appears to be descended from flying ancestors.  In the\r\ndevelopment of the birds, feathers came before wings.  But once the\r\nfeather was developed the possibility of making a light spread of\r\nfeathers led inevitably to the wing.  We know of the fossil remains of\r\none bird at least which had reptilian teeth in its jaw and a long\r\nreptilian tail, but which also had a true bird’s wing and which\r\ncertainly flew and held its own among the pterodactyls of the Mesozoic\r\ntime.  Nevertheless birds were neither varied nor abundant in Mesozoic\r\ntimes.  If a man could go back to typical Mesozoic country, he might\r\nwalk for days and never see or hear such a thing as a bird, though he\r\nwould see a great abundance of pterodactyls and insects among the\r\nfronds and reeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL OF THE ARCHEOPTERYX; ONE OF THE EARLIEST BIRDS\r\nFOSSIL OF THE ARCHEOPTERYX; ONE OF THE EARLIEST BIRDS\r\n\r\n_Nat. Hist. Mus._\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd another thing he would probably never see, and that would be any\r\nsign of a mammal.  Probably the first mammals were in existence\r\nmillions of years before the first thing one could call a bird, but\r\nthey were altogether too small and obscure and remote for attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nHESPERORNIS IN ITS NATIVE SEAS\r\nHESPERORNIS IN ITS NATIVE SEAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest mammals, like the earliest birds, were creatures driven by\r\ncompetition and pursuit into a life of hardship and adaptation to cold.\r\n With them also the scale became quill-like, and was developed into a\r\nheat-retaining covering; and they too underwent modifications, similar\r\nin kind though different in detail, to become warm-blooded and\r\nindependent of basking.  Instead of feathers they developed hairs, and\r\ninstead of guarding and incubating their eggs they kept them warm and\r\nsafe by retaining them inside their bodies until they were almost\r\nmature.  Most of them became altogether vivaparous and brought their\r\nyoung into the world alive.  And even after their young were born they\r\ntended to maintain a protective and nutritive association with them. \r\nMost but not all mammals to-day have mammæ and suckle their young.  Two\r\nmammals still live which lay eggs and which have not proper mammæ,\r\nthough they nourish their young by a nutritive secretion of the under\r\nskin; these are the duck-billed platypus and the echidna.  The echidna\r\nlays leathery eggs and then puts them into a pouch under its belly, and\r\nso carries them about warm and safe until they hatch.\r\n\r\nBut just as a visitor to the Mesozoic world might have searched for\r\ndays and weeks before finding a bird, so, unless he knew exactly where\r\nto go and look, he might have searched in vain for any traces of a\r\nmammal.  Both birds and mammals would have seemed very eccentric and\r\nsecondary and unimportant creatures in Mesozoic times.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KI-WI, APTERYX, STILL FOUND IN NEW ZEALAND\r\nTHE KI-WI, APTERYX, STILL FOUND IN NEW ZEALAND\r\n_Photo: Autotype Fine Art Co._\r\n\r\nSLAB OF LOWER PLIOCENE MARL\r\nSLAB OF LOWER PLIOCENE MARL\r\nDiscovered in Greece; it is rich in fossilized bones of early mammals\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Age of Reptiles lasted, it is now guessed, eighty million years.\r\nHad any quasi-human intelligence been watching the world through that\r\ninconceivable length of time, how safe and eternal the sunshine and\r\nabundance must have seemed, how assured the wallowing prosperity of the\r\ndinosaurs and the flapping abundance of the flying lizards! And then\r\nthe mysterious rhythms and accumulating forces of the universe began to\r\nturn against that quasi-eternal stability.  That run of luck for life\r\nwas running out.  Age by age, myriad of years after myriad of years,\r\nwith halts no doubt and retrogressions, came a change towards hardship\r\nand extreme conditions, came great alterations of level and great\r\nredistributions of mountain and sea.  We find one thing in the Record\r\nof the Rocks during the decadence of the long Mesozoic age of\r\nprosperity that is very significant of steadily sustained changes of\r\ncondition, and that is a violent fluctuation of living forms and the\r\nappearance of new and strange species. Under the gathering threat of\r\nextinction the older orders and genera are displaying their utmost\r\ncapacity for variation and adaptation.  The Ammonites for example in\r\nthese last pages of the Mesozoic chapter exhibit a multitude of\r\nfantastic forms.  Under settled conditions there is no encouragement\r\nfor novelties; they do not develop, they are suppressed; what is best\r\nadapted is already there.  Under novel conditions it is the ordinary\r\ntype that suffers, and the novelty that may have a better chance to\r\nsurvive and establish itself....\r\n\r\nThere comes a break in the Record of the Rocks that may represent\r\nseveral million years.  There is a veil here still, over even the\r\noutline of the history of life.  When it lifts again, the Age of\r\nReptiles is at an end; the Dinosaurs, the Plesiosaurs and Ichthyosaurs,\r\nthe Pterodactyls, the innumerable genera and species of Ammonite have\r\nall gone absolutely.  In all their stupendous variety they have died\r\nout and left no descendants.  The cold has killed them.  All their\r\nfinal variations were insufficient; they had never hit upon survival\r\nconditions.  The world had passed through a phase of extreme conditions\r\nbeyond their powers of endurance, a slow and complete massacre of\r\nMesozoic life has occurred, and we find now a new scene, a new and\r\nhardier flora, and a new and hardier fauna in possession of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is still a bleak and impoverished scene with which this new volume\r\nof the book of life begins. The cycads and tropical conifers have given\r\nplace very largely to trees that shed their leaves to avoid destruction\r\nby the snows of winter and to flowering plants and shrubs, and where\r\nthere was formerly a profusion of reptiles, an increasing variety of\r\nbirds and mammals is entering into their inheritance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\nTHE AGE OF MAMMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opening of the next great period in the life of the earth, the\r\nCainozoic period, was a period of upheaval and extreme volcanic\r\nactivity. Now it was that the vast masses of the Alps and Himalayas and\r\nthe mountain backbone of the Rockies and Andes were thrust up, and that\r\nthe rude outlines of our present oceans and continents appeared. The\r\nmap of the world begins to display a first dim resemblance to the map\r\nof to-day. It is estimated now that between forty and eighty million\r\nyears have elapsed from the beginnings of the Cainozoic period to the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the Cainozoic period the climate of the world was\r\naustere.  It grew generally warmer until a fresh phase of great\r\nabundance was reached, after which conditions grew hard again and the\r\nearth passed into a series of extremely cold cycles, the Glacial Ages,\r\nfrom which apparently it is now slowly emerging.\r\n\r\nBut we do not know sufficient of the causes of climatic change at\r\npresent to forecast the possible fluctuations of climatic conditions\r\nthat lie before us.  We may be moving towards increasing sunshine or\r\nlapsing towards another glacial age; volcanic activity and the upheaval\r\nof mountain masses may be increasing or diminishing; we do not know; we\r\nlack sufficient science.\r\n\r\nWith the opening of this period the grasses appear; for the first time\r\nthere is pasture in the world; and with the full development of the\r\nonce obscure mammalian type, appear a number of interesting grazing\r\nanimals and of carnivorous types which prey upon these.\r\n\r\nAt first these early mammals seem to differ only in a few characters\r\nfrom the great herbivorous and carnivorous reptiles that ages before\r\nhad flourished and then vanished from the earth.  A careless observer\r\nmight suppose that in this second long age of warmth and plenty that\r\nwas now beginning, nature was merely repeating the first, with\r\nherbivorous and carnivorous mammals to parallel the herbivorous and\r\ncarnivorous dinosaurs, with birds replacing pterodactyls and so on. \r\nBut this would be an altogether superficial comparison.  The variety of\r\nthe universe is infinite and incessant; it progresses eternally;\r\nhistory never repeats itself and no parallels are precisely true. The\r\ndifferences between the life of the Cainozoic and Mesozoic periods are\r\nfar profounder than the resemblances.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAMMAL OF THE EARLY CAINOZOIC PERIOD\r\nA MAMMAL OF THE EARLY CAINOZOIC PERIOD\r\n\r\nThe Titanotherum (Brontops) Robustum\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most fundamental of all these differences lies in the mental life\r\nof the two periods.  It arises essentially out of the continuing\r\ncontact of parent and offspring which distinguishes mammalian and in a\r\nlesser degree bird life, from the life of the reptile.  With very few\r\nexceptions the reptile abandons its egg to hatch alone.  The young\r\nreptile has no knowledge whatever of its parent; its mental life, such\r\nas it is, begins and ends with its own experiences. It may tolerate the\r\nexistence of its fellows but it has no communication with them; it\r\nnever imitates, never learns from them, is incapable of concerted\r\naction with them.  Its life is that of an isolated individual.  But\r\nwith the suckling and cherishing of young which was distinctive of the\r\nnew mammalian and avian strains arose the possibility of learning by\r\nimitation, of communication, by warning cries and other concerted\r\naction, of mutual control and instruction.  A teachable type of life\r\nhad come into the world.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mammals of the Cainozoic period are but little superior in\r\nbrain size to the more active carnivorous dinosaurs, but as we read on\r\nthrough the record towards modern times we find, in every tribe and\r\nrace of the mammalian animals, a steady universal increase in brain\r\ncapacity.  For instance we find at a comparatively early stage that\r\nrhinoceros-like beasts appear.  There is a creature, the Titanotherium,\r\nwhich lived in the earliest division of this period.  It was probably\r\nvery like a modern rhinoceros in its habits and needs.  But its brain\r\ncapacity was not one tenth that of its living successor.\r\n\r\nThe earlier mammals probably parted from their offspring as soon as\r\nsuckling was over, but, once the capacity for mutual understanding has\r\narisen, the advantages of continuing the association are very great;\r\nand we presently find a number of mammalian species displaying the\r\nbeginnings of a true social life and keeping together in herds, packs\r\nand flocks, watching each other, imitating each other, taking warning\r\nfrom each other’s acts and cries.  This is something that the world had\r\nnot seen before among vertebrated animals. Reptiles and fish may no\r\ndoubt be found in swarms and shoals; they have been hatched in\r\nquantities and similar conditions have kept them together, but in the\r\ncase of the social and gregarious mammals the association arises not\r\nsimply from a community of external forces, it is sustained by an inner\r\nimpulse.  They are not merely like one another and so found in the same\r\nplaces at the same times; they like one another and so they keep\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTENOMYLUS HITCHCOCKI--A GIRAFFE-CAMEL\r\nSTENOMYLUS HITCHCOCKI—A GIRAFFE-CAMEL\r\n\r\n_Nat.

We cannot conceive in\r\nourselves the swift uncomplicated urgency of a reptile’s instinctive\r\nmotives, its appetites, fears and hates.  We cannot understand them in\r\ntheir simplicity because all our motives are complicated; our’s are\r\nbalances and resultants and not simple urgencies.  But the mammals and\r\nbirds have self-restraint and consideration for other individuals, a\r\nsocial appeal, a self- control that is, at its lower level, after our\r\nown fashion. We can in consequence establish relations with almost all\r\nsorts of them.  When they suffer they utter cries and make movements\r\nthat rouse our feelings.  We can make understanding pets of them with a\r\nmutual recognition.  They can be tamed to self-restraint towards us,\r\ndomesticated and taught.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE SIZES OF BRAINS OF RHINOCEROS AND DINOCERAS\r\nCOMPARATIVE SIZES OF BRAINS OF RHINOCEROS AND DINOCERAS\r\n\r\n_Nat. Hist. Mus._\r\n\r\n\r\nThat unusual growth of brain which is the central fact of Cainozoic\r\ntimes marks a new communication and interdependence of individuals.  It\r\nforeshadows the development of human societies of which we shall soon\r\nbe telling.\r\n\r\nAs the Cainozoic period unrolled, the resemblance of its flora and\r\nfauna to the plants and animals that inhabit the world to-day\r\nincreased.  The big clumsy Uintatheres and Titanotheres, the\r\nEntelodonts and Hyracodons, big clumsy brutes like nothing living,\r\ndisappeared.  On the other hand a series of forms led up by steady\r\ndegrees from grotesque and clumsy predecessors to the giraffes, camels,\r\nhorses, elephants, deer, dogs and lions and tigers of the existing\r\nworld.  The evolution of the horse is particularly legible upon the\r\ngeological record.  We have a fairly complete series of forms from a\r\nsmall tapir-like ancestor in the early Cainozoic.  Another line of\r\ndevelopment that has now been pieced together with some precision is\r\nthat of the llamas and camels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\nMONKEYS, APES AND SUB-MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nNaturalists divide the class _Mammalia_ into a number of orders. At the\r\nhead of these is the order _Primates_, which includes the lemurs, the\r\nmonkeys, apes and man. Their classification was based originally upon\r\nanatomical resemblances and took no account of any mental qualities.\r\n\r\nNow the past history of the Primates is one very difficult to decipher\r\nin the geological record.  They are for the most part animals which\r\nlive in forests like the lemurs and monkeys or in bare rocky places\r\nlike the baboons.  They are rarely drowned and covered up by sediment,\r\nnor are most of them very numerous species, and so they do not figure\r\nso largely among the fossils as the ancestors of the horses, camels and\r\nso forth do.  But we know that quite early in the Cainozoic period,\r\nthat is to say some forty million years ago or so, primitive monkeys\r\nand lemuroid creatures had appeared, poorer in brain and not so\r\nspecialized as their later successors.\r\n\r\nThe great world summer of the middle Cainozoic period drew at last to\r\nan end.  It was to follow those other two great summers in the history\r\nof life, the summer of the Coal Swamps and the vast summer of the Age\r\nof Reptiles.  Once more the earth spun towards an ice age.  The world\r\nchilled, grew milder for a time and chilled again.  In the warm past\r\nhippopotami had wallowed through a lush sub-tropical vegetation, and a\r\ntremendous tiger with fangs like sabres, the sabre-toothed tiger, had\r\nhunted its prey where now the journalists of Fleet Street go to and\r\nfro.  Now came a bleaker age and still bleaker ages.  A great weeding\r\nand extinction of species occurred.  A woolly rhinoceros, adapted to a\r\ncold climate, and the mammoth, a big woolly cousin of the elephants,\r\nthe Arctic musk ox and the reindeer passed across the scene.  Then\r\ncentury by century the Arctic ice cap, the wintry death of the great\r\nIce Age, crept southward.  In England it came almost down to the\r\nThames, in America it reached Ohio.  There would be warmer spells of a\r\nfew thousand years and relapses towards a bitterer cold.\r\n\r\nGeologists talk of these wintry phases as the First, Second, Third and\r\nFourth Glacial Ages, and of the interludes as Interglacial periods.  We\r\nlive to-day in a world that is still impoverished and scarred by that\r\nterrible winter.  The First Glacial Age was coming on 600,000 years\r\nago; the Fourth Glacial Age reached its bitterest some fifty thousand\r\nyears ago.  And it was amidst the snows of this long universal winter\r\nthat the first man-like beings lived upon our planet.\r\n\r\nA MAMMOTH\r\nA MAMMOTH\r\n\r\nBy the middle Cainozoic period there have appeared various apes with\r\nmany quasi-human attributes of the jaws and leg bones, but it is only\r\nas we approach these Glacial Ages that we find traces of creatures that\r\nwe can speak of as “almost human.”  These traces are not bones but\r\nimplements.  In Europe, in deposits of this period, between half a\r\nmillion and a million years old, we find flints and stones that have\r\nevidently been chipped intentionally by some handy creature desirous of\r\nhammering, scraping or fighting with the sharpened edge.  These things\r\nhave been called “Eoliths” (dawn stones).  In Europe there are no bones\r\nnor other remains of the creature which made these objects, simply the\r\nobjects themselves.  For all the certainty we have it may have been\r\nsome entirely un-human but intelligent monkey.  But at Trinil in Java,\r\nin accumulations of this age, a piece of a skull and various teeth and\r\nbones have been found of a sort of ape man, with a brain case bigger\r\nthan that of any living apes, which seems to have walked erect.  This\r\ncreature is now called _Pithecanthropus erectus_, the walking ape man,\r\nand the little trayful of its bones is the only help our imaginations\r\nhave as yet in figuring to, ourselves the makers of the Eoliths.\r\n\r\nFLINT IMPLEMENTS FOUND IN PILTDOWN REGION\r\nFLINT IMPLEMENTS FOUND IN PILTDOWN REGION\r\n\r\n_Nat. Hist. Mus._\r\n\r\nIt is not until we come to sands that are almost a quarter of a million\r\nyears old that we find any other particle of a sub- human being.  But\r\nthere are plenty of implements, and they are steadily improving in\r\nquality as we read on through the record.  They are no longer clumsy\r\nEoliths; they are now shapely instruments made with considerable skill.\r\n _And they are much bigger than the similar implements afterwards made\r\nby true man._  Then, in a sandpit at Heidelberg, appears a single\r\nquasi-human jaw-bone, a clumsy jaw-bone, absolutely chinless, far\r\nheavier than a true human jaw-bone and narrower, so that it is\r\nimprobable the creature’s tongue could have moved about for articulate\r\nspeech.  On the strength of this jaw-bone, scientific men suppose this\r\ncreature to have been a heavy, almost human monster, possibly with huge\r\nlimbs and hands, possibly with a thick felt of hair, and they call it\r\nthe Heidelberg Man.\r\n\r\nA THEORETICAL RESTORATION OF THE PITHECANTHROPUS ERECTUS BY PROF. RUTOT\r\nA THEORETICAL RESTORATION OF THE PITHECANTHROPUS ERECTUS BY PROF. RUTOT\r\n\r\nThis jaw-bone is, I think, one of the most tormenting objects in the\r\nworld to our human curiosity.  To see it is like looking through a\r\ndefective glass into the past and catching just one blurred and\r\ntantalizing glimpse of this Thing, shambling through the bleak\r\nwilderness, clambering to avoid the sabre- toothed tiger, watching the\r\nwoolly rhinoceros in the woods. Then before we can scrutinize the\r\nmonster, he vanishes.

Here there are the remains of a thick\r\nsub-human skull much larger than any existing ape’s, and a\r\nchimpanzee-like jaw-bone which may or may not belong to it, and, in\r\naddition, a bat-shaped piece of elephant bone evidently carefully\r\nmanufactured, through which a hole had apparently been bored.

He stands\r\napart from his kindred; a very different being either from the\r\nHeidelberg creature or from any living ape.  No other vestige like him\r\nis known.  But the gravels and deposits of from one hundred thousand\r\nyears onward are increasingly rich in implements of flint and similar\r\nstone. And these implements are no longer rude “Eoliths.” The\r\narchæologists are presently able to distinguish scrapers, borers,\r\nknives, darts, throwing stones and hand axes ....\r\n\r\nWe are drawing very near to man.  In our next section we shall have to\r\ndescribe the strangest of all these precursors of humanity, the\r\nNeanderthalers, the men who were almost, but not quite, true men.\r\n\r\nBut it may be well perhaps to state quite clearly here that no\r\nscientific man supposes either of these creatures, the Heidelberg Man\r\nor _Eoanthropus_, to be direct ancestors of the men of to-day.  These\r\nare, at the closest, related forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\nTHE NEANDERTHALER AND THE RHODESIAN MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout fifty or sixty thousand years ago, before the climax of the\r\nFourth Glacial Age, there lived a creature on earth so like a man that\r\nuntil a few years ago its remains were considered to be altogether\r\nhuman. We have skulls and bones of it and a great accumulation of the\r\nlarge implements it made and used. It made fires. It sheltered in caves\r\nfrom the cold. It probably dressed skins roughly and wore them. It was\r\nright-handed as men are.\r\n\r\nYet now the ethnologists tell us these creatures were not true men. \r\nThey were of a different species of the same genus.  They had heavy\r\nprotruding jaws and great brow ridges above the eyes and very low\r\nforeheads.  Their thumbs were not opposable to the fingers as men’s\r\nare; their necks were so poised that they could not turn back their\r\nheads and look up to the sky.  They probably slouched along, head down\r\nand forward.  Their chinless jaw-bones resemble the Heidelberg jaw-bone\r\nand are markedly unlike human jaw-bones.  And there were great\r\ndifferences from the human pattern in their teeth. Their cheek teeth\r\nwere more complicated in structure than ours, more complicated and not\r\nless so; they had not the long fangs of our cheek teeth; and also these\r\nquasi-men had not the marked canines (dog teeth) of an ordinary human\r\nbeing. The capacity of their skulls was quite human, but the brain was\r\nbigger behind and lower in front than the human brain. Their\r\nintellectual faculties were differently arranged.  They were not\r\nancestral to the human line. Mentally and physically they were upon a\r\ndifferent line from the human line.\r\n\r\nSkulls and bones of this extinct species of man were found at\r\nNeanderthal among other places, and from that place these strange\r\nproto-men have been christened Neanderthal Men, or Neanderthalers. They\r\nmust have endured in Europe for many hundreds or even thousands of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nTHE NEANDERTHALER, ACCORDING TO PROF. RUTOT\r\nTHE NEANDERTHALER, ACCORDING TO PROF.

Europe for example was covered\r\nwith ice reaching as far south as the Thames and into Central Germany\r\nand Russia; there was no Channel separating Britain from France; the\r\nMediterranean and the Red Sea were great valleys, with perhaps a chain\r\nof lakes in their deeper portions, and a great inland sea spread from\r\nthe present Black Sea across South Russia and far into Central Asia. \r\nSpain and all of Europe not actually under ice consisted of bleak\r\nuplands under a harder climate than that of Labrador, and it was only\r\nwhen North Africa was reached that one would have found a temperate\r\nclimate.  Across the cold steppes of Southern Europe with its sparse\r\narctic vegetation, drifted such hardy creatures as the woolly mammoth,\r\nand woolly rhinoceros, great oxen and reindeer, no doubt following the\r\nvegetation northward in spring and southward in autumn.\r\n\r\nMap: Possible Outline of Europe and Western Asia at the Maximum of the\r\nFourth Ice Age (about 50,000 years ago)\r\n\r\nSuch was the scene through which the Neanderthaler wandered, gathering\r\nsuch subsistence as he could from small game or fruits and berries and\r\nroots.  Possibly he was mainly a vegetarian, chewing twigs and roots. \r\nHis level elaborate teeth suggest a largely vegetarian dietary.  But we\r\nalso find the long marrow bones of great animals in his caves, cracked\r\nto extract the marrow.  His weapons could not have been of much avail\r\nin open conflict with great beasts, but it is supposed that he attacked\r\nthem with spears at difficult river crossings and even constructed\r\npitfalls for them.  Possibly he followed the herds and preyed upon any\r\ndead that were killed in fights, and perhaps he played the part of\r\njackal to the sabre-toothed tiger which still survived in his day. \r\nPossibly in the bitter hardships of the Glacial Ages this creature had\r\ntaken to attacking animals after long ages of vegetarian adaptation.\r\n\r\nWe cannot guess what this Neanderthal man looked like. He may have been\r\nvery hairy and very unhuman-looking indeed.  It is even doubtful if he\r\nwent erect.  He may have used his knuckles as well as his feet to hold\r\nhimself up. Probably he went about alone or in small family groups.  It\r\nis inferred from the structure of his jaw that he was incapable of\r\nspeech as we understand it.\r\n\r\nFor thousands of years these Neanderthalers were the highest animals\r\nthat the European area had ever seen; and then some thirty or\r\nthirty-five thousand years ago as the climate grew warmer a race of\r\nkindred beings, more intelligent, knowing more, talking and\r\nco-operating together, came drifting into the Neanderthaler’s world\r\nfrom the south.  They ousted the Neanderthalers from their caves and\r\nsquatting places; they hunted the same food; they probably made war\r\nupon their grisly predecessors and killed them off.  These newcomers\r\nfrom the south or the east—for at present we do not know their region\r\nof origin—who at last drove the Neanderthalers out of existence\r\naltogether, were beings of our own blood and kin, the first True Men. \r\nTheir brain-cases and thumbs and necks and teeth were anatomically the\r\nsame as our own.  In a cave at Cro-Magnon and in another at Grimaldi, a\r\nnumber of skeletons have been found, the earliest truly human remains\r\nthat are so far known.\r\n\r\nSo it is our race comes into the Record of the Rocks, and the story of\r\nmankind begins.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF (1) MODERN SKULL AND (2) RHODESIAN SKULL\r\nCOMPARISON OF (1) MODERN SKULL AND (2) RHODESIAN SKULL\r\n\r\n_Nat. Hist. Mus._\r\n\r\nThe world was growing liker our own in those days though the climate\r\nwas still austere.  The glaciers of the Ice Age were receding in\r\nEurope; the reindeer of France and Spain presently gave way to great\r\nherds of horses as grass increased upon the steppes, and the mammoth\r\nbecame more and more rare in southern Europe and finally receded\r\nnorthward altogether ....\r\n\r\nWe do not know where the True Men first originated.  But in the summer\r\nof 1921, an extremely interesting skull was found together with pieces\r\nof a skeleton at Broken Hill in South Africa, which seems to be a relic\r\nof a third sort of man, intermediate in its characteristics between the\r\nNeanderthaler and the human being.  The brain-case indicates a brain\r\nbigger in front and smaller behind than the Neanderthaler’s, and the\r\nskull was poised erect upon the backbone in a quite human way.  The\r\nteeth also and the bones are quite human. But the face must have been\r\nape-like with enormous brow ridges and a ridge along the middle of the\r\nskull.  The creature was indeed a true man, so to speak, with an ape-\r\nlike, Neanderthaler face.  This Rhodesian Man is evidently still closer\r\nto real men than the Neanderthal Man.\r\n\r\nThis Rhodesian skull is probably only the second of what in the end may\r\nprove to be a long list of finds of sub-human species which lived on\r\nthe earth in the vast interval of time between the beginnings of the\r\nIce Age and the appearance of their common heir, and perhaps their\r\ncommon exterminator, the True Man.  The Rhodesian skull itself may not\r\nbe very ancient.  Up to the time of publishing this book there has been\r\nno exact determination of its probable age. It may be that this\r\nsub-human creature survived in South Africa until quite recent times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\nTHE FIRST TRUE MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest signs and traces at present known to science, of a\r\nhumanity which is indisputably kindred with ourselves, have been found\r\nin western Europe and particularly in France and Spain. Bones, weapons,\r\nscratchings upon bone and rock, carved fragments of bone, and paintings\r\nin caves and upon rock surfaces dating. it is supposed. from 30,000\r\nyears ago or more, have been discovered in both these countries. Spain\r\nis at present the richest country in the world in these first relics of\r\nour real human ancestors.\r\n\r\nOf course our present collections of these things are the merest\r\nbeginnings of the accumulations we may hope for in the future, when\r\nthere are searchers enough to make a thorough examination of all\r\npossible sources and when other countries in the world, now\r\ninaccessible to archæologists, have been explored in some detail.  The\r\ngreater part of Africa and Asia has never even been traversed yet by a\r\ntrained observer interested in these matters and free to explore, and\r\nwe must be very careful therefore not to conclude that the early true\r\nmen were distinctively inhabitants of western Europe or that they first\r\nappeared in that region.\r\n\r\nIn Asia or Africa or submerged beneath the sea of to-day there may be\r\nricher and much earlier deposits of real human remains than anything\r\nthat has yet come to light.  I write in Asia or Africa, and I do not\r\nmention America because so far there have been no finds at all of any\r\nof the higher Primates, either of great apes, sub-men, Neanderthalers\r\nnor early true men.  This development of life seems to have been an\r\nexclusively old world development, and it was only apparently at the\r\nend of the Old Stone Age that human beings first made their way across\r\nthe land connexion that is now cut by Behring Straits, into the\r\nAmerican continent.\r\n\r\nONE OF THE MARVELLOUS CAVE PAINTINGS OF ALTAMIRA, NORTH SPAIN\r\nONE OF THE MARVELLOUS CAVE PAINTINGS OF ALTAMIRA, NORTH SPAIN\r\n\r\nThe Walls of the Caves are covered in these representations of Bulls,\r\netc., painted in the soft tones of red shaded to black. They may be\r\nfifteen or twenty thousand years old\r\n\r\nThese first real human beings we know of in Europe appear already to\r\nhave belonged to one or other of at least two very distinct races. One\r\nof these races was of a very high type indeed; it was tall and big\r\nbrained.  One of the women’s skulls found exceeds in capacity that of\r\nthe average man of to-day.  One of the men’s skeletons is over six feet\r\nin height.  The physical type resembled that of the North American\r\nIndian.  From the Cro-Magnon cave in which the first skeletons were\r\nfound these people have been called Cro-Magnards.  They were savages,\r\nbut savages of a high order. The second race, the race of the Grimaldi\r\ncave remains, was distinctly negroid in its characters.  Its nearest\r\nliving affinities are the Bushmen and Hottentots of South Africa.  It\r\nis interesting to find at the very outset of the known human story,\r\nthat mankind was already racially divided into at least two main\r\nvarieties; and one is tempted to such unwarrantable guesses as that the\r\nformer race was probably brownish rather than black and that it came\r\nfrom the East or North, and that the latter was blackish rather than\r\nbrown and came from the equatorial south.\r\n\r\nBONE CARVINGS OF THE PALÆOLITHIC PERIOD\r\nBONE CARVINGS OF THE PALÆOLITHIC PERIOD\r\n\r\n(1 and 2) Mammoth tusk carved to shape of Reindeer, (3) Dagger Handle\r\nrepresenting Mammoth, and (4) Bone engraved with Horses’ Heads\r\n\r\n_Brit. Mus._\r\n\r\nAnd these savages of perhaps forty thousand years ago were so human\r\nthat they pierced shells to make necklaces, painted themselves, carved\r\nimages of bone and stone, scratched figures on rocks and bones, and\r\npainted rude but often very able sketches of beasts and the like upon\r\nthe smooth walls of caves and upon inviting rock surfaces.  They made a\r\ngreat variety of implements, much smaller in scale and finer than those\r\nof the Neanderthal men.  We have now in our museums great quantities of\r\ntheir implements, their statuettes, their rock drawings and the like.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of them were hunters.  Their chief pursuit was the wild\r\nhorse, the little bearded pony of that time.  They followed it as it\r\nmoved after pasture.  And also they followed the bison.  They knew the\r\nmammoth, because they have left us strikingly effective pictures of\r\nthat creature.  To judge by one rather ambiguous drawing they trapped\r\nand killed it.\r\n\r\nThey hunted with spears and throwing stones.  They do not seem to have\r\nhad the bow, and it is doubtful if they had yet learnt to tame any\r\nanimals.  They had no dogs.  There is one carving of a horse’s head and\r\none or two drawings that suggest a bridled horse, with a twisted skin\r\nor tendon round it.  But the little horses of that age and region could\r\nnot have carried a man, and if the horse was domesticated it was used\r\nas a led horse.  It is doubtful and improbable that they had yet learnt\r\nthe rather unnatural use of animal’s milk as food.\r\n\r\nThey do not seem to have erected any buildings though they may have had\r\ntents of skins, and though they made clay figures they never rose to\r\nthe making of pottery.  Since they had no cooking implements their\r\ncookery must have been rudimentary or nonexistent.  They knew nothing\r\nof cultivation and nothing of any sort of basket work or woven cloth.\r\nExcept for their robes of skin or fur they were naked painted savages.\r\n\r\nThese earliest known men hunted the open steppes of Europe for a\r\nhundred centuries perhaps, and then slowly drifted and changed before a\r\nchange of climate.  Europe, century by century, was growing milder and\r\ndamper. Reindeer receded northward and eastward, and bison and horse\r\nfollowed.  The steppes gave way to forests, and red deer took the place\r\nof horse and bison. There is a change in the character of the\r\nimplements with this change in their application.  River and lake\r\nfishing becomes of great importance to men, and fine implements of bone\r\nincreased.  “The bone needles of this age,” says de Mortillet, “are\r\nmuch superior to those of later, even historical times, down to the\r\nRenaissance.  The Romans, for example, never had needles comparable to\r\nthose of this epoch.”\r\n\r\nTHE RUTOT BUST OF A CRO-MAGNON MAN\r\nTHE RUTOT BUST OF A CRO-MAGNON MAN\r\n\r\nAlmost fifteen or twelve thousand years ago a fresh people drifted into\r\nthe south of Spain, and left very remarkable drawings of themselves\r\nupon exposed rock faces there.  These were the Azilians (named from the\r\nMas d’Azil cave). They had the bow; they seem to have worn feather\r\nheaddresses; they drew vividly; but also they had reduced their\r\ndrawings to a sort of symbolism—a man for instance would be represented\r\nby a vertical dab with two or three horizontal dabs—that suggest the\r\ndawn of the writing idea. Against hunting sketches there are often\r\nmarks like tallies. One drawing shows two men smoking out a bees’ nest.\r\n\r\nFIGHT OF BOWMEN\r\nAmong the most recent discoveries of Palæolithic Art are these\r\nspecimens found in 1920 in Spain.  They are probably ten or twelve\r\nthousand years old\r\n\r\nThese are the latest of the men that we call Palæolithic (Old Stone\r\nAge) because they had only chipped implements.  By ten or twelve\r\nthousand years a new sort of life has dawned in Europe, men have learnt\r\nnot only to chip but to polish and grind stone implements, and they\r\nhave begun cultivation.  The Neolithic Age (New Stone Age) was\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that less than a century ago there still\r\nsurvived in a remote part of the world, in Tasmania, a race of human\r\nbeings at a lower level of physical and intellectual development than\r\nany of these earliest races of mankind who have left traces in Europe. \r\nThese people had long ago been cut off by geographical changes from the\r\nrest of the species, and from stimulation and improvement.  They seem\r\nto have degenerated rather than developed.  They lived a base life\r\nsubsisting upon shellfish and small game.  They had no habitations but\r\nonly squatting places.  They were real men of our species, but they had\r\nneither the manual dexterity nor the artistic powers of the first true\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\nPRIMITIVE THOUGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now let us indulge in a very interesting speculation; how did it\r\nfeel to be a man in those early days of the human adventure? How did\r\nmen think and what did they think in those remote days of hunting and\r\nwandering four hundred centuries ago before seed time and harvest\r\nbegan. Those were days long before the written record of any human\r\nimpressions, and we are left almost entirely to inference and guesswork\r\nin our answers to these questions.\r\n\r\nThe sources to which scientific men have gone in their attempts to\r\nreconstruct that primitive mentality are very various.  Recently the\r\nscience of psycho-analysis, which analyzes the way in which the\r\negotistic and passionate impulses of the child are restrained,\r\nsuppressed, modified or overlaid, to adapt them to the needs of social\r\nlife, seems to have thrown a considerable amount of light upon the\r\nhistory of primitive society; and another fruitful source of suggestion\r\nhas been the study of the ideas and customs of such contemporary\r\nsavages as still survive.  Again there is a sort of mental\r\nfossilization which we find in folk-lore and the deep-lying irrational\r\nsuperstitions and prejudices that still survive among modern civilized\r\npeople.  And finally we have in the increasingly numerous pictures,\r\nstatues, carvings, symbols and the like, as we draw near to our own\r\ntime, clearer and clearer indications of what man found interesting and\r\nworthy of record and representation.\r\n\r\nPrimitive man probably thought very much as a child thinks, that is to\r\nsay in a series of imaginative pictures.  He conjured up images or\r\nimages presented themselves to his mind, and he acted in accordance\r\nwith the emotions they aroused.  So a child or an uneducated person\r\ndoes to-day. Systematic thinking is apparently a comparatively late\r\ndevelopment in human experience; it has not played any great part in\r\nhuman life until within the last three thousand years.  And even to-day\r\nthose who really control and order their thoughts are but a small\r\nminority of mankind.  Most of the world still lives by imagination and\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nProbably the earliest human societies, in the opening stages of the\r\ntrue human story, were small family groups.  Just as the flocks and\r\nherds of the earlier mammals arose out of families which remained\r\ntogether and multiplied, so probably did the earliest tribes.  But\r\nbefore this could happen a certain restraint upon the primitive\r\negotisms of the individual had to be established.  The fear of the\r\nfather and respect for the mother had to be extended into adult life,\r\nand the natural jealousy of the old man of the group for the younger\r\nmales as they grew up had to be mitigated.  The mother on the other\r\nhand was the natural adviser and protector of the young.  Human social\r\nlife grew up out of the reaction between the crude instinct of the\r\nyoung to go off and pair by themselves as they grew up, on the one\r\nhand, and the dangers and disadvantages of separation on the other.  An\r\nanthropological writer of great genius, J. J. Atkinson, in his _Primal\r\nLaw_, has shown how much of the customary law of savages, the _Tabus_,\r\nthat are so remarkable a fact in tribal life, can be ascribed to such a\r\nmental adjustment of the needs of the primitive human animal to a\r\ndeveloping social life, and the later work of the psycho- analysts has\r\ndone much to confirm his interpretation of these possibilities.\r\n\r\nSome speculative writers would have us believe that respect and fear of\r\nthe Old Man and the emotional reaction of the primitive savage to older\r\nprotective women, exaggerated in dreams and enriched by fanciful mental\r\nplay, played a large part in the beginnings of primitive religion and\r\nin the conception of gods and goddesses.  Associated with this respect\r\nfor powerful or helpful personalities was a dread and exaltation of\r\nsuch personages after their deaths, due to their reappearance in\r\ndreams.  It was easy to believe they were not truly dead but only\r\nfantastically transferred to a remoteness of greater power.\r\n\r\nThe dreams, imaginations and fears of a child are far more vivid and\r\nreal than those of a modern adult, and primitive man was always\r\nsomething of a child. He was nearer to the animals also, and he could\r\nsuppose them to have motives and reactions like his own.  He could\r\nimagine animal helpers, animal enemies, animal gods.  One needs to have\r\nbeen an imaginative child oneself to realize again how important,\r\nsignificant, portentous or friendly, strangely shaped rocks, lumps of\r\nwood, exceptional trees or the like may have appeared to the men of the\r\nOld Stone Age, and how dream and fancy would create stories and legends\r\nabout such things that would become credible as they told them.  Some\r\nof these stories would be good enough to remember and tell again.  The\r\nwomen would tell them to the children and so establish a tradition.  To\r\nthis day most imaginative children invent long stories in which some\r\nfavourite doll or animal or some fantastic semi-human being figures as\r\nthe hero, and primitive man probably did the same—with a much stronger\r\ndisposition to believe his hero real.\r\n\r\nRELICS OF THE STONE AGE\r\nRELICS OF THE STONE AGE\r\n\r\nChert implements from Somaliland.  In general form they are similar to\r\nthose found in Western and Northern Europe\r\n\r\n_Brit. Mus._\r\n\r\nFor the very earliest of the true men that we know of were probably\r\nquite talkative beings.  In that way they have differed from the\r\nNeanderthalers and had an advantage over them.  The Neanderthaler may\r\nhave been a dumb animal. Of course the primitive human speech was\r\nprobably a very scanty collection of names, and may have been eked out\r\nwith gestures and signs.\r\n\r\nThere is no sort of savage so low as not to have a kind of science of\r\ncause and effect.  But primitive man was not very critical in his\r\nassociations of cause with effect; he very easily connected an effect\r\nwith something quite wrong as its cause. “You do so and so,” he said,\r\n“and so and so happens.”  You give a child a poisonous berry and it\r\ndies.  You eat the heart of a valiant enemy and you become strong. \r\nThere we have two bits of cause and effect association, one true one\r\nfalse.  We call the system of cause and effect in the mind of a savage,\r\nFetish; but Fetish is simply savage science.  It differs from modern\r\nscience in that it is totally unsystematic and uncritical and so more\r\nfrequently wrong.\r\n\r\nWIDESPREAD SIMILARITY OF MEN OF THE STONE AGE\r\nWIDESPREAD SIMILARITY OF MEN OF THE STONE AGE\r\n\r\nOn the left is a flint implement excavated in Gray’s Inn Lane, London;\r\non the right one of similar form chipped by primitive men of Somaliland\r\n\r\n_Brit. Mus._\r\n\r\nIn many cases it is not difficult to link cause and effect, in many\r\nothers erroneous ideas were soon corrected by experience; but there was\r\na large series of issues of very great importance to primitive man,\r\nwhere he sought persistently for causes and found explanations that\r\nwere wrong but not sufficiently wrong nor so obviously wrong as to be\r\ndetected.  It was a matter of great importance to him that game should\r\nbe abundant or fish plentiful and easily caught, and no doubt he tried\r\nand believed in a thousand charms, incantations and omens to determine\r\nthese desirable results.  Another great concern of his was illness and\r\ndeath.  Occasionally infections crept through the land and men died of\r\nthem.  Occasionally men were stricken by illness and died or were\r\nenfeebled without any manifest cause.  This too must have given the\r\nhasty, emotional mind of primitive man much feverish exercise. Dreams\r\nand fantastic guesses made him blame this, or appeal for help to that\r\nman or beast or thing.  He had the child’s aptitude for fear and panic.\r\n\r\nQuite early in the little human tribe, older, steadier minds sharing\r\nthe fears, sharing the imaginations, but a little more forceful than\r\nthe others, must have asserted themselves, to advise, to prescribe, to\r\ncommand. This they declared unpropitious and that imperative, this an\r\nomen of good and that an omen of evil.  The expert in Fetish, the\r\nMedicine Man, was the first priest.  He exhorted, he interpreted\r\ndreams, he warned, he performed the complicated hocus pocus that\r\nbrought luck or averted calamity.  Primitive religion was not so much\r\nwhat we now call religion as practice and observance, and the early\r\npriest dictated what was indeed an arbitrary primitive practical\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\nTHE BEGINNINGS OF CULTIVATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are still very ignorant about the beginnings of cultivation and\r\nsettlement in the world although a vast amount of research and\r\nspeculation has been given to these matters in the last fifty years.\r\nAll that we can say with any confidence at present is that somewhen\r\nabout 15,000 and 12,000 B.C. while the Azilian people were in the south\r\nof Spain and while the remnants of the earlier hunters were drifting\r\nnorthward and eastward, somewhere in North Africa or Western Asia or in\r\nthat great Mediterranean valley that is now submerged under the waters\r\nof the Mediterranean sea, there were people who, age by age, were\r\nworking out two vitally important things; they were beginning\r\ncultivation and they were domesticating animals. They were also\r\nbeginning to make, in addition to the chipped implements of their\r\nhunter forebears, implements of polished stone. They had discovered the\r\npossibility of basketwork and roughly woven textiles of plant fibre,\r\nand they were beginning to make a rudely modelled pottery.\r\n\r\nThey were entering upon a new phase in human culture, the Neolithic\r\nphase (New Stone Age) as distinguished from the Palæolithic (Old Stone)\r\nphase of the Cro-Magnards, the Grimaldi people, the Azilians and their\r\nlike.  [1] Slowly these Neolithic people spread over the warmer parts\r\nof the world; and the arts they had mastered, the plants and animals\r\nthey had learnt to use, spread by imitation and acquisition even more\r\nwidely than they did.  By 10,000 B.C., most of mankind was at the\r\nNeolithic level.\r\n\r\nNow the ploughing of land, the sowing of seed, the reaping of harvest,\r\nthreshing and grinding, may seem the most obviously reasonable steps to\r\na modern mind just as to a modern mind it is a commonplace that the\r\nworld is round.  What else could you do? people will ask.  What else\r\ncan it be?  But to the primitive man of twenty thousand years ago\r\nneither of the systems of action and reasoning that seem so sure and\r\nmanifest to us to-day were at all obvious.  He felt his way to\r\neffectual practice through a multitude of trials and misconceptions,\r\nwith fantastic and unnecessary elaborations and false interpretations\r\nat every turn.  Somewhere in the Mediterranean region, wheat grew wild;\r\nand man may have learnt to pound and then grind up its seeds for food\r\nlong before he learnt to sow.  He reaped before he sowed.\r\n\r\nAnd it is a very remarkable thing that throughout the world wherever\r\nthere is sowing and harvesting there is still traceable the vestiges of\r\na strong primitive association of the idea of sowing with the idea of a\r\nblood sacrifice, and primarily of the sacrifice of a human being.  The\r\nstudy of the original entanglement of these two things is a profoundly\r\nattractive one to the curious mind; the interested reader will find it\r\nvery fully developed in that monumental work, Sir J. G. Frazer’s\r\n_Golden Bough_.  It was an entanglement, we must remember, in the\r\nchildish, dreaming, myth-making primitive mind; no reasoned process\r\nwill explain it.  But in that world of 12,000 to 20,000 years ago, it\r\nwould seem that whenever seed time came round to the Neolithic peoples\r\nthere was a human sacrifice.  And it was not the sacrifice of any mean\r\nor outcast person; it was the sacrifice usually of a chosen youth or\r\nmaiden, a youth more often who was treated with profound deference and\r\neven worship up to the moment of his immolation.  He was a sort of\r\nsacrificial god-king, and all the details of his killing had become a\r\nritual directed by the old, knowing men and sanctioned by the\r\naccumulated usage of ages.\r\n\r\nNEOLITHIC FLINT IMPLEMENTS\r\nNEOLITHIC FLINT IMPLEMENTS\r\n\r\n_Brit. Mus._\r\n\r\nAt first primitive men, with only a very rough idea of the seasons,\r\nmust have found great difficulty in determining when was the propitious\r\nmoment for the seed-time sacrifice and the sowing.  There is some\r\nreason for supposing that there was an early stage in human experience\r\nwhen men had no idea of a year. The first chronology was in lunar\r\nmonths; it is supposed that the years of the Biblical patriarchs are\r\nreally moons, and the Babylonian calendar shows distinct traces of an\r\nattempt to reckon seed time by taking thirteen lunar months to see it\r\nround. This lunar influence upon the calendar reaches down to our own\r\ndays. If usage did not dull our sense of its strangeness we should\r\nthink it a very remarkable thing indeed that the Christian Church does\r\nnot commemorate the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ on the\r\nproper anniversaries but on dates that vary year by year with the\r\nphases of the moon.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether the first agriculturalists made any\r\nobservation of the stars.  It is more likely that stars were first\r\nobserved by migratory herdsmen, who found them a convenient mark of\r\ndirection.  But once their use in determining seasons was realized,\r\ntheir importance to agriculture became very great.  The seed-time\r\nsacrifice was linked up with the southing or northing of some prominent\r\nstar.  A myth and worship of that star was for primitive man an almost\r\ninevitable consequence.\r\n\r\nNEOLITHICISM OF TO-DAY\r\nNEOLITHICISM OF TO-DAY\r\n\r\nSpearheads, exactly as in the true Neolithic days, but made recently by\r\nAustralian Natives,\r\n\r\n(1) Made from a telegraph insulator;\r\n\r\n(2) from a piece of broken bottle glass.\r\n\r\n_Brit. Mus._\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see how important the man of knowledge and experience,\r\nthe man who knew about the blood sacrifice and the stars, became in\r\nthis early Neolithic world.\r\n\r\nThe fear of uncleanness and pollution, and the methods of cleansing\r\nthat were advisable, constituted another source of power for the\r\nknowledgeable men and women. For there have always been witches as well\r\nas wizards, and priestesses as well as priests.  The early priest was\r\nreally not so much a religious man as a man of applied science.  His\r\nscience was generally empirical and often bad; he kept it secret from\r\nthe generality of men very jealously; but that does not alter the fact\r\nthat his primary function was knowledge and that his primary use was a\r\npractical use.\r\n\r\nSPECIMEN OF NEOLITHIC POTTERY\r\nSPECIMEN OF NEOLITHIC POTTERY\r\n\r\nDug up at Mortlake from the Thames Bed\r\n\r\n_Brit. Mus._\r\n\r\nTwelve or fifteen thousand years ago, in all the warm and fairly\r\nwell-watered parts of the Old World these Neolithic human communities,\r\nwith their class and tradition of priests and priestesses and their\r\ncultivated fields and their development of villages and little walled\r\ncities, were spreading.  Age by age a drift and exchange of ideas went\r\non between these communities.  Eliot Smith and Rivers have used the\r\nterm “Heliolithic culture” for the culture of these first agricultural\r\npeoples.  “Heliolithic” (Sun and Stone) is not perhaps the best\r\npossible word to use for this, but until scientific men give us a\r\nbetter one we shall have to use it.  Originating somewhere in the\r\nMediterranean and western Asiatic area, it spread age by age eastward\r\nand from island to island across the Pacific until it may even have\r\nreached America and mingled with the more primitive ways of living of\r\nthe Mongoloid immigrants coming down from the North.\r\n\r\nWherever the brownish people with the Heliolithic culture went they\r\ntook with them all or most of a certain group of curious ideas and\r\npractices.  Some of them are such queer ideas that they call for the\r\nexplanation of the mental expert.  They made pyramids and great mounds,\r\nand set up great circles of big stones, perhaps to facilitate the\r\nastronomical observation of the priests; they made mummies of some or\r\nall of their dead; they tattooed and circumcized; they had the old\r\ncustom, known as the _couvade_, of sending the _father_ to bed and rest\r\nwhen a child was born, and they had as a luck symbol the well-known\r\nSwastika.\r\n\r\nIf we were to make a map of the world with dots to show how far these\r\ngroup practices have left their traces, we should make a belt along the\r\ntemperate and sub-tropical coasts of the world from Stonehenge and\r\nSpain across the world to Mexico and Peru.  But Africa below the\r\nequator, north central Europe, and north Asia would show none of these\r\ndottings; there lived races who were developing along practically\r\nindependent lines.\r\n\r\n[1] The term Palæolithic we may note is also used to cover the\r\nNeanderthaler and even the Eolithic implements.  The pre-human age is\r\ncalled the “Older Palæolithic;” the age of true men using unpolished\r\nstones in the “Newer Palæolithic.”\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\nPRIMITIVE NEOLITHIC CIVILIZATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 10,000 B.C. the geography of the world was very similar in its\r\ngeneral outline to that of the world to-day. It is probable that by\r\nthat time the great barrier across the Straits of Gibraltar that had\r\nhitherto banked back the ocean waters from the Mediterranean valley had\r\nbeen eaten through, and that the Mediterranean was a sea following much\r\nthe same coastlines as it does now. The Caspian Sea was probably still\r\nfar more extensive than it is at present, and it may have been\r\ncontinuous with the Black Sea to the north of the Caucasus Mountains.\r\nAbout this great Central Asian sea lands that are now steppes and\r\ndeserts were fertile and habitable. Generally it was a moister and more\r\nfertile world. European Russia was much more a land of swamp and lake\r\nthan it is now, and there may still have been a land connexion between\r\nAsia and America at Behring Straits.\r\n\r\nIt would have been already possible at that time to have distinguished\r\nthe main racial divisions of mankind as we know them to-day.  Across\r\nthe warm temperate regions of this rather warmer and better-wooded\r\nworld, and along the coasts, stretched the brownish peoples of the\r\nHeliolithic culture, the ancestors of the bulk of the living\r\ninhabitants of the Mediterranean world, of the Berbers, the Egyptians\r\nand of much of the population of South and Eastern Asia.  This great\r\nrace had of course a number of varieties.  The Iberian or Mediterranean\r\nor “dark-white” race of the Atlantic and Mediterranean coast, the\r\n“Hamitic” peoples which include the Berbers and Egyptians, the\r\nDravidians; the darker people of India, a multitude of East Indian\r\npeople, many Polynesian races and the Maoris are all divisions of\r\nvarious value of this great main mass of humanity.  Its western\r\nvarieties are whiter than its eastern.\r\n\r\nIn the forests of central and northern Europe a more blonde variety of\r\nmen with blue eyes was becoming distinguishable, branching off from the\r\nmain mass of brownish people, a variety which many people now speak of\r\nas the Nordic race.  In the more open regions of northeastern Asia was\r\nanother differentiation of this brownish humanity in the direction of a\r\ntype with more oblique eyes, high cheek-bones, a yellowish skin, and\r\nvery straight black hair, the Mongolian peoples.  In South Africa,\r\nAustralia, in many tropical islands in the south of Asia were remains\r\nof the early negroid peoples. The central parts of Africa were already\r\na region of racial intermixture. Nearly all the coloured races of\r\nAfrica to-day seem to be blends of the brownish peoples of the north\r\nwith a negroid substratum.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Diagrammatic Summary of Current Ideas of the Relationship of Human\r\nRaces\r\n\r\nWe have to remember that human races can all interbreed freely and that\r\nthey separate, mingle and reunite as clouds do.  Human races do not\r\nbranch out like trees with branches that never come together again.  It\r\nis a thing we need to bear constantly in mind, this remingling of races\r\nat any opportunity.  It will save us from many cruel delusions and\r\nprejudices if we do so.  People will use such a word as race in the\r\nloosest manner, and base the most preposterous generalizations upon it.\r\n They will speak of a “British” race or of a “European” race.  But\r\nnearly all the European nations are confused mixtures of brownish,\r\ndark-white, white and Mongolian elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAYA STELE\r\nA MAYA STELE\r\n\r\nShowing a worshipper and a Serpent God.  Note the grotesque faces in\r\nthe writing\r\n\r\n_Brit. Mus._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was at the Neolithic phase of human development that peoples of the\r\nMongolian breed first made their way into America.  Apparently they\r\ncame by way of Behring Straits and spread southward.  They found\r\ncaribou, the American reindeer, in the north and great herds of bison\r\nin the south.  When they reached South America there were still living\r\nthe Glyptodon, a gigantic armadillo, and the Megatherium, a monstrous\r\nclumsy sloth as high as an elephant.  They probably exterminated the\r\nlatter beast, which was as helpless as it was big.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of these American tribes never rose above a hunting\r\nnomadic Neolithic life.  They never discovered the use of iron, and\r\ntheir chief metal possessions were native gold and copper.  But in\r\nMexico, Yucatan and Peru conditions existed favourable to settled\r\ncultivation, and here about 1000 B.C. or so arose very interesting\r\ncivilizations of a parallel but different type from the old-world\r\ncivilization.  Like the much earlier primitive civilizations of the old\r\nworld these communities displayed a great development of human\r\nsacrifice about the processes of seed time and harvest; but while in\r\nthe old world, as we shall see, these primary ideas were ultimately\r\nmitigated, complicated and overlaid by others, in America they\r\ndeveloped and were elaborated, to a very high degree of intensity. \r\nThese American civilized countries were essentially priest-ruled\r\ncountries; their war chiefs and rulers were under a rigorous rule of\r\nlaw and omen.\r\n\r\nThese priests carried astronomical science to a high level of accuracy.\r\n They knew their year better than the Babylonians of whom we shall\r\npresently tell.  In Yucatan they had a kind of writing, the Maya\r\nwriting, of the most curious and elaborate character.  So far as we\r\nhave been able to decipher it, it was used mainly for keeping the exact\r\nand complicated calendars upon which the priests expended their\r\nintelligence. The art of the Maya civilization came to a climax about\r\n700 or 800 A.D.  The sculptured work of these people amazes the modern\r\nobserver by its great plastic power and its frequent beauty, and\r\nperplexes him by a grotesqueness and by a sort of insane\r\nconventionality and intricacy outside the circle of his ideas.  There\r\nis nothing quite like it in the old world.  The nearest approach, and\r\nthat is a remote one, is found in archaic Indian carvings. Everywhere\r\nthere are woven feathers and serpents twine in and out.  Many Maya\r\ninscriptions resemble a certain sort of elaborate drawing made by\r\nlunatics in European asylums, more than any other old-world work.  It\r\nis as if the Maya mind had developed upon a different line from the\r\nold-world mind, had a different twist to its ideas, was not, by\r\nold-world standards, a rational mind at all.\r\n\r\nThis linking of these aberrant American civilizations to the idea of a\r\ngeneral mental aberration finds support in their extraordinary\r\nobsession by the shedding of human blood.  The Mexican civilization in\r\nparticular ran blood; it offered thousands of human victims yearly. \r\nThe cutting open of living victims, the tearing out of the still\r\nbeating heart, was an act that dominated the minds and lives of these\r\nstrange priesthoods.  The public life, the national festivities all\r\nturned on this fantastically horrible act.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEOLITHIC WARRIOR\r\nNEOLITHIC WARRIOR\r\n\r\nModelled from drawing by Prof. Rutot\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordinary existence of the common people in these communities was\r\nvery like the ordinary existence of any other barbaric peasantry. \r\nTheir pottery, weaving and dyeing was very good.  The Maya writing was\r\nnot only carven on stone but written and painted upon skins and the\r\nlike.  The European and American museums contain many enigmatical Maya\r\nmanuscripts of which at present little has been deciphered except the\r\ndates.  In Peru there were beginnings of a similar writing but they\r\nwere superseded by a method of keeping records by knotting cords.  A\r\nsimilar method of mnemonics was in use in China thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the old world before 4000 or 5000 B.C., that is to say three or four\r\nthousand years earlier, there were primitive civilizations not unlike\r\nthese American civilizations; civilizations based upon a temple, having\r\na vast quantity of blood sacrifices and with an intensely astronomical\r\npriesthood.  But in the old world the primitive civilizations reacted\r\nupon one another and developed towards the conditions of our own world.\r\n In America these primitive civilizations never progressed beyond this\r\nprimitive stage.  Each of them was in a little world of its own. \r\nMexico it seems knew little or nothing of Peru, until the Europeans\r\ncame to America.  The potato, which was the principal food stuff in\r\nPeru, was unknown in Mexico.\r\n\r\nAge by age these peoples lived and marvelled at their gods and made\r\ntheir sacrifices and died.  Maya art rose to high levels of decorative\r\nbeauty.  Men made love and tribes made war.  Drought and plenty,\r\npestilence and health, followed one another.  The priests elaborated\r\ntheir calendar and their sacrificial ritual through long centuries, but\r\nmade little progress in other directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\nSUMERIA, EARLY EGYPT AND WRITING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old world is a wider, more varied stage than the new. By 6000 or\r\n7000 B.C. there were already quasi-civilized communities almost at the\r\nPeruvian level, appearing in various fertile regions of Asia and in the\r\nNile valley. At that time north Persia and western Turkestan and south\r\nArabia were all more fertile than they are now, and there are traces of\r\nvery early communities in these regions. It is in lower Mesopotamia\r\nhowever and in Egypt that there first appear cities, temples,\r\nsystematic irrigation, and evidences of a social organization rising\r\nabove the level of a mere barbaric village-town. In those days the\r\nEuphrates and Tigris flowed by separate mouths into the Persian Gulf,\r\nand it was in the country between them that the Sumerians built their\r\nfirst cities. About the same time, for chronology is still vague, the\r\ngreat history of Egypt was beginning.\r\n\r\nThese Sumerians appear to have been a brownish people with prominent\r\nnoses.  They employed a sort of writing that has been deciphered, and\r\ntheir language is now known.  They had discovered the use of bronze and\r\nthey built great tower-like temples of sun-dried brick. The clay of\r\nthis country is very fine; they used it to write upon, and so it is\r\nthat their inscriptions have been preserved to us.  They had cattle,\r\nsheep, goats and asses, but no horses.  They fought on foot, in close\r\nformation, carrying spears and shields of skin. Their clothing was of\r\nwool and they shaved their heads.\r\n\r\nEach of the Sumerian cities seems generally to have been an independent\r\nstate with a god of its own and priests of its own.  But sometimes one\r\ncity would establish an ascendancy over others and exact tribute from\r\ntheir population.  A very ancient inscription at Nippur records the\r\n“empire,” the first recorded empire, of the Sumerian city of Erech. \r\nIts god and its priest-king claimed an authority from the Persian Gulf\r\nto the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRICK OF HAMMURABI, KING OF BABYLON ABOUT 2200 B.C.\r\nBRICK OF HAMMURABI, KING OF BABYLON ABOUT 2200 B.C.\r\n\r\nNote the cuneiform characters of the inscription, which records the\r\nbuilding of a temple to a Sun God\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first writing was merely an abbreviated method of pictorial record. \r\nEven before Neolithic times men were beginning to write.  The Azilian\r\nrock pictures to which we have already referred show the beginning of\r\nthe process. Many of them record hunts and expeditions, and in most of\r\nthese the human figures are plainly drawn.  But in some the painter\r\nwould not bother with head and limbs; he just indicated men by a\r\nvertical and one or two transverse strokes.  From this to a\r\nconventional condensed picture writing was an easy transition.  In\r\nSumeria, where the writing was done on clay with a stick, the dabs of\r\nthe characters soon became unrecognizably unlike the things they stood\r\nfor, but in Egypt where men painted on walls and on strips of the\r\npapyrus reed (the first paper) the likeness to the thing imitated\r\nremained.  From the fact that the wooden styles used in Sumeria made\r\nwedge-shaped marks, the Sumerian writing is called cuneiform (=\r\nwedge-shaped).\r\n\r\n\r\nEBONY CYLINDER SEALS OF FIRST EGYPTIAN DYNASTY\r\nEBONY CYLINDER SEALS OF FIRST EGYPTIAN DYNASTY\r\n\r\nRecovered from the Tombs at Abydos in 1921 by the British School of\r\nArchæology.  They give evidence of early form of block printing\r\n\r\n\r\nAn important step towards writing was made when pictures were used to\r\nindicate not the thing represented but some similar thing.  In the\r\nrebus dear to children of a suitable age, this is still done to-day. \r\nWe draw a camp with tents and a bell, and the child is delighted to\r\nguess that this is the Scotch name Campbell.  The Sumerian language was\r\na language made up of accumulated syllables rather like some\r\ncontemporary Amerindian languages, and it lent itself very readily to\r\nthis syllabic method of writing words expressing ideas that could not\r\nbe conveyed by pictures directly.  Egyptian writing underwent parallel\r\ndevelopments.  Later on, when foreign peoples with less distinctly\r\nsyllabled methods of speech were to learn and use these picture scripts\r\nthey were to make those further modifications and simplifications that\r\ndeveloped at last into alphabetical writing.  All the true alphabets of\r\nthe later world derived from a mixture of the Sumerian cuneiform and\r\nthe Egyptian hieroglyphic (priest writing).  Later in China there was\r\nto develop a conventionalized picture writing, but in China it never\r\ngot to the alphabetical stage.\r\n\r\nThe invention of writing was of very great importance in the\r\ndevelopment of human societies.  It put agreements, laws, commandments\r\non record.  It made the growth of states larger than the old city\r\nstates possible.  It made a continuous historical consciousness\r\npossible.  The command of the priest or king and his seal could go far\r\nbeyond his sight and voice and could survive his death.  It is\r\ninteresting to note that in ancient Sumeria seals were greatly used.  A\r\nking or a nobleman or a merchant would have his seal often very\r\nartistically carved, and would impress it on any clay document he\r\nwished to authorize.  So close had civilization got to printing six\r\nthousand years ago.  Then the clay was dried hard and became permanent.\r\n For the reader must remember that in the land of Mesopotamia for\r\ncountless years, letters, records and accounts were all written on\r\ncomparatively indestructible tiles.  To that fact we owe a great wealth\r\nof recovered knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAKHARA PYRAMIDS\r\nTHE SAKHARA PYRAMIDS\r\n\r\nThe Pyramid to the right, the step Pyramid, is the oldest stone\r\nbuilding in the world\r\n\r\n_Photo: F.

McLeish_\r\n\r\n\r\nDaily life in those first city lands of the old world must have been\r\nvery similar in both Egypt and Sumeria.  And except for the asses and\r\ncattle in the streets it must have been not unlike the life in the Maya\r\ncities of America three or four thousand years later.  Most of the\r\npeople in peace time were busy with irrigation and cultivation—except\r\non days of religious festivity. They had no money and no need for it. \r\nThey managed their small occasional trades by barter.  The princes and\r\nrulers who alone had more than a few possessions used gold and silver\r\nbars and precious stones for any incidental act of trade.  The temple\r\ndominated life; in Sumeria it was a great towering temple that went up\r\nto a roof from which the stars were observed; in Egypt it was a massive\r\nbuilding with only a ground floor. In Sumeria the priest ruler was the\r\ngreatest, most splendid of beings.  In Egypt however there was one who\r\nwas raised above the priests; he was the living incarnation of the\r\nchief god of the land, the Pharaoh, the god king.\r\n\r\nThere were few changes in the world in those days; men’s days were\r\nsunny, toilsome and conventional.  Few strangers came into the land and\r\nsuch as did fared uncomfortably.  The priest directed life according to\r\nimmemorial rules and watched the stars for seed time and marked the\r\nomens of the sacrifices and interpreted the warnings of dreams.  Men\r\nworked and loved and died, not unhappily, forgetful of the savage past\r\nof their race and heedless of its future.  Sometimes the ruler was\r\nbenign. Such was Pepi II, who reigned in Egypt for ninety years.\r\nSometimes he was ambitious and took men’s sons to be soldiers and sent\r\nthem against neighbouring city states to war and plunder, or he made\r\nthem toil to build great buildings.  Such were Cheops and Chephren and\r\nMycerinus, who built those vast sepulchral piles, the pyramids at\r\nGizeh. The largest of these is 450 feet high and the weight of stone in\r\nit is 4,883,000 tons.  All this was brought down the Nile in boats and\r\nlugged into place chiefly by human muscle.  Its erection must have\r\nexhausted Egypt more than a great war would have done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\nPRIMITIVE NOMADIC PEOPLES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not only in Mesopotamia and the Nile Valley that men were\r\nsettling down to agriculture and the formation of city states in the\r\ncenturies between 6000 and 8000 B.C. Wherever there were possibilities\r\nof irrigation and a steady all-the-year-round food supply men were\r\nexchanging the uncertainties and hardships of hunting and wandering for\r\nthe routines of settlement. On the upper Tigris a people called the\r\nAssyrians were founding cities; in the valleys of Asia Minor and on the\r\nMediterranean shores and islands, there were small communities growing\r\nup to civilization. Possibly parallel developments of human life were\r\nalready going on in favourable regions of India, and China. In many\r\nparts of Europe where there were lakes well stocked with fish, little\r\ncommunities of men had long settled in dwellings built on piles over\r\nthe water, and were eking out agriculture by fishing and hunting. But\r\nover much larger areas of the old world no such settlement was\r\npossible. The land was too harsh, too thickly wooded or too arid, or\r\nthe seasons too uncertain for mankind, with only the implements and\r\nscience of that age to take root.\r\n\r\nFor settlement under the conditions of the primitive civilizations men\r\nneeded a constant water supply and warmth and sunshine.  Where these\r\nneeds were not satisfied, man could live as a transient, as a hunter\r\nfollowing his game, as a herdsman following the seasonal grass, but he\r\ncould not settle.  The transition from the hunting to the herding life\r\nmay have been very gradual.  From following herds of wild cattle or (in\r\nAsia) wild horses, men may have come to an idea of property in them,\r\nhave learnt to pen them into valleys, have fought for them against\r\nwolves, wild dogs and other predatory beasts.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOTTERY AND IMPLEMENTS OF THE LAKE DWELLERS\r\nPOTTERY AND IMPLEMENTS OF THE LAKE DWELLERS\r\n\r\n_Brit. Mus._\r\n\r\nA CONTEMPORARY LAKE VILLAGE\r\nA CONTEMPORARY LAKE VILLAGE\r\n\r\nThese Borneo dwellings are practically counterparts of the homes of\r\nEuropean neolithic communities 6000 B.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo while the primitive civilizations of the cultivators were growing up\r\nchiefly in the great river valleys, a different way of living, the\r\nnomadic life, a life in constant movement to and fro from winter\r\npasture to summer pasture, was also growing up.  The nomadic peoples\r\nwere on the whole hardier than the agriculturalists; they were less\r\nprolific and numerous, they had no permanent temples and no highly\r\norganized priesthood; they had less gear; but the reader must not\r\nsuppose that theirs was necessarily a less highly developed way of\r\nliving on that account.  In many ways this free life was a fuller life\r\nthan that of the tillers of the soil.  The individual was more\r\nself-reliant; less of a unit in a crowd.  The leader was more\r\nimportant; the medicine man perhaps less so.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOMADS IN EGYPT\r\n\r\nNOMADS IN EGYPT\r\nNOMADS IN EGYPT\r\n\r\nEgyptian wall painting in a tomb near ancient Beni Hassan, middle\r\nEgypt.  It depicts the arrival of a tribe of Semitic Nomads in Egypt\r\nabout the year of 1895 B.C.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoving over large stretches of country the nomad took a wider view of\r\nlife.  He touched on the confines of this settled land and that.  He\r\nwas used to the sight of strange faces.  He had to scheme and treat for\r\npasture with competing tribes.  He knew more of minerals than the folk\r\nupon the plough lands because he went over mountain passes and into\r\nrocky places.  He may have been a better metallurgist.  Possibly bronze\r\nand much more probably iron smelting were nomadic discoveries.  Some of\r\nthe earliest implements of iron reduced from its ores have been found\r\nin Central Europe far away from the early civilizations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLINT KNIVES OF 4500 B.C.\r\nFLINT KNIVES OF 4500 B.C.\r\n\r\nExcavated 1922 by the British School of Archæology in Egypt from First\r\nDynasty Tombs\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the settled folk had their textiles and their pottery\r\nand made many desirable things.  It was inevitable that as the two\r\nsorts of life, the agricultural and the nomadic differentiated, a\r\ncertain amount of looting and trading should develop between the two. \r\nIn Sumeria particularly which had deserts and seasonal country on\r\neither hand it must have been usual to have the nomads camping close to\r\nthe cultivated fields, trading and stealing and perhaps tinkering, as\r\ngipsies do to this day.  (But hens they would not steal, because the\r\ndomestic fowl—an Indian jungle fowl originally was not domesticated by\r\nman until about 1000 B.C.)  They would bring precious stones and things\r\nof metal and leather.  If they were hunters they would bring skins. \r\nThey would get in exchange pottery and beads and glass, garments and\r\nsuchlike manufactured things.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGYPT PEASANTS GOING TO WORK\r\nEGYPT PEASANTS GOING TO WORK\r\n\r\nFrom an ancient and curiously painted model in the British Museum\r\n\r\n\r\nThree main regions and three main kinds of wandering and imperfectly\r\nsettled people there were in those remote days of the first\r\ncivilizations in Sumeria and early Egypt.  Away in the forests of\r\nEurope were the blonde Nordic peoples, hunters and herdsmen, a lowly\r\nrace.  The primitive civilizations saw very little of this race before\r\n1500 B.C.  Away on the steppes of eastern Asia various Mongolian\r\ntribes, the Hunnish peoples, were domesticating the horse and\r\ndeveloping a very wide sweeping habit of seasonal movement between\r\ntheir summer and winter camping places. Possibly the Nordic and Hunnish\r\npeoples were still separated from one another by the swamps of Russia\r\nand the greater Caspian Sea of that time.  For very much of Russia\r\nthere was swamp and lake.  In the deserts, which were growing more arid\r\nnow, of Syria and Arabia, tribes of a dark white or brownish people,\r\nthe Semitic tribes, were driving flocks of sheep and goats and asses\r\nfrom pasture to pasture.  It was these Semitic shepherds and certain\r\nmore negroid people from southern Persia, the Elamites, who were the\r\nfirst nomads to come into close contact with the early civilizations. \r\nThey came as traders and as raiders.  Finally there arose leaders among\r\nthem with bolder imaginations, and they became conquerors.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTELE GLORIFYING KING NARAM SIN, OF AKKAD\r\nSTELE GLORIFYING KING NARAM SIN, OF AKKAD\r\n\r\nThis monarch, son of Sargon I, was a great architecht as well as a\r\nfamous conqueror.  Discovered in 1898 among the ruins of Susa, Persia\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 2750 B.C. a great Semitic leader, Sargon, had conquered the whole\r\nSumerian land and was master of all the world from the Persian Gulf to\r\nthe Mediterranean Sea.  He was an illiterate barbarian and his people,\r\nthe Akkadians, learnt the Sumerian writing and adopted the Sumerian\r\nlanguage as the speech of the officials and the learned.  The empire he\r\nfounded decayed after two centuries, and after one inundation of\r\nElamites a fresh Semitic people, the Amorites, by degrees established\r\ntheir rule over Sumeria.  They made their capital in what had hitherto\r\nbeen a small up-river town, Babylon, and their empire is called the\r\nfirst Babylonian Empire.  It was consolidated by a great king called\r\nHammurabi (circa 2100 B.C.) who made the earliest code of laws yet\r\nknown to history.\r\n\r\nThe narrow valley of the Nile lies less open to nomadic invasion than\r\nMesopotamia, but about the time of Hammurabi occurred a successful\r\nSemitic invasion of Egypt and a line of Pharaohs was set up, the Hyksos\r\nor “shepherd kings,” which lasted for several centuries.  These Semitic\r\nconquerors never assimilated themselves with the Egyptians; they were\r\nalways regarded with hostility as foreigners and barbarians; and they\r\nwere at last expelled by a popular uprising about 1600 B.C.\r\n\r\nBut the Semites had come into Sumeria for good and all, the two races\r\nassimilated and the Babylonian Empire became Semitic in its language\r\nand character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\nTHE FIRST SEAGOING PEOPLES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest boats and ships must have come into use some twenty-five\r\nor thirty thousand years ago. Man was probably paddling about on the\r\nwater with a log of wood or an inflated skin to assist him, at latest\r\nin the beginnings of the Neolithic period. A basketwork boat covered\r\nwith skin and caulked was used in Egypt and Sumeria from the beginnings\r\nof our knowledge. Such boats are still used there. They are used to\r\nthis day in Ireland and Wales and in Alaska; sealskin boats still make\r\nthe crossing of Behring Straits. The hollow log followed as tools\r\nimproved. The building of boats and then ships came in a natural\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the legend of Noah’s Ark preserves the memory of some early\r\nexploit in shipbuilding, just as the story of the Flood, so widely\r\ndistributed among the peoples of the world, may be the tradition of the\r\nflooding of the Mediterranean basin.\r\n\r\nThere were ships upon the Red Sea long before the pyramids were built,\r\nand there were ships on the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf by 7000 B.C.\r\n Mostly these were the ships of fishermen, but some were already\r\ntrading and pirate ships—for knowing what we do of mankind we may guess\r\npretty safely that the first sailors plundered where they could and\r\ntraded where they had to do so.\r\n\r\nThe seas on which these first ships adventured were inland seas on\r\nwhich the wind blew fitfully and which were often at a dead calm for\r\ndays together, so that sailing did not develop beyond an accessory use.\r\n It is only in the last four hundred years that the well-rigged,\r\nocean-going, sailing ship has developed.  The ships of the ancient\r\nworld were essentially rowing ships which hugged the shore and went\r\ninto harbour at the first sign of rough weather.  As ships grew into\r\nbig galleys they caused a demand for war captives as galley slaves.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted the appearance of the Semitic people as wanderers\r\nand nomads in the region of Syria and Arabia, and how they conquered\r\nSumeria and set up first the Akkadian and then the first Babylonian\r\nEmpire.  In the west these same Semitic peoples were taking to the sea.\r\n They set up a string of harbour towns along the Eastern coast of the\r\nMediterranean, of which Tyre and Sidon were the chief; and by the time\r\nof Hammurabi in Babylon, they had spread as traders, wanderers and\r\ncolonizers over the whole Mediterranean basin. These sea Semites were\r\ncalled the Phœnicians, They settled largely in Spain, pushing back the\r\nold Iberian Basque population and sending coasting expeditions through\r\nthe straits of Gibraltar; and they set up colonies upon the north coast\r\nof Africa.  Of Carthage, one of these Phœnician cities, we shall have\r\nmuch more to tell later.\r\n\r\nBut the Phœnicians were not the first people to have galleys in the\r\nMediterranean waters.  There was already a series of towns and cities\r\namong the islands and coasts of that sea belonging to a race or races\r\napparently connected by blood and language with the Basques to the west\r\nand the Berbers and Egyptians to the south, the Ægean peoples. These\r\npeoples must not be confused with the Greeks, who come much later into\r\nour story; they were pre-Greek, but they had cities in Greece and Asia\r\nMinor; Mycenæ and Troy for example, and they had a great and prosperous\r\nestablishment at Cnossos in Crete.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the last half century that the industry of excavating\r\narchæologists has brought the extent and civilization of the Ægean\r\npeoples to our knowledge. Cnossos has been most thoroughly explored; it\r\nwas happily not succeeded by any city big enough to destroy its ruins,\r\nand so it is our chief source of information about this once almost\r\nforgotten civilization.\r\n\r\nThe history of Cnossos goes back as far as the history of Egypt; the\r\ntwo countries were trading actively across the sea by 4000 B.C.  By\r\n2500 B.C., that is between the time of Sargon I and Hammurabi, Cretan\r\ncivilization was at its zenith.\r\n\r\nCnossos was not so much a town as a great palace for the Cretan monarch\r\nand his people.  It was not even fortified. It was only fortified later\r\nas the Phœnicians grew strong, and as a new and more terrible breed of\r\npirates, the Greeks, came upon the sea from the north.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREASURE HOUSE AT MYCENÆ\r\nTHE TREASURE HOUSE AT MYCENÆ\r\n\r\n_Photo: Fred Boissonnas_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe monarch was called Minos, as the Egyptian monarch was called\r\nPharaoh; and he kept his state in a palace fitted with running water,\r\nwith bathrooms and the like conveniences such as we know of in no other\r\nancient remains.  There he held great festivals and shows.  There was\r\nbull-fighting, singularly like the bull-fighting that still survives in\r\nSpain; there was resemblance even in the costumes of the bull-fighters;\r\nand there were gymnastic displays.  The women’s clothes were remarkably\r\nmodern in spirit; they wore corsets and flounced dresses.  The pottery,\r\nthe textile manufactures, the sculpture, painting, jewellery, ivory,\r\nmetal and inlay work of these Cretans was often astonishingly\r\nbeautiful.  And they had a system of writing, but that still remains to\r\nbe deciphered.\r\n\r\nThis happy and sunny and civilized life lasted for some score of\r\ncenturies.  About 2000 B.C. Cnossos and Babylon abounded in comfortable\r\nand cultivated people who probably led very pleasant lives.  They had\r\nshows and they had religious festivals, they had domestic slaves to\r\nlook after them and industrial slaves to make a profit for them.  Life\r\nmust have seemed very secure in Cnossos for such people, sunlit and\r\ngirdled by the blue sea.  Egypt of course must have appeared rather a\r\ndeclining country in those days under the rule of her half-barbaric\r\nshepherd kings, and if one took an interest in politics one must have\r\nnoticed how the Semitic people seemed to be getting everywhere, ruling\r\nEgypt, ruling distant Babylon, building Nineveh on the upper Tigris,\r\nsailing west to the Pillars of Hercules (the straits of Gibraltar) and\r\nsetting up their colonies on those distant coasts.\r\n\r\nThere were some active arid curious minds in Cnossos, because later on\r\nthe Greeks told legends of a certain skilful Cretan artificer, Dædalus,\r\nwho attempted to make some sort of flying machine, perhaps a glider,\r\nwhich collapsed and fell into the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note some of the differences as well as the\r\nresemblances between the life of Cnossos and our own.  To a Cretan\r\ngentleman of 2500 B.C. iron was a rare metal which fell out of the sky\r\nand was curious rather than useful—for as yet only meteoric iron was\r\nknown, iron had not been obtained from its ores.  Compare that with our\r\nmodern state of affairs pervaded by iron everywhere.  The horse again\r\nwould be a quite legendary creature to our Cretan, a sort of super-ass\r\nwhich lived in the bleak northern lands far away beyond the Black Sea.\r\nCivilization for him dwelt chiefly in Ægean Greece and Asia Minor,\r\nwhere Lydians and Carians and Trojans lived a life and probably spoke\r\nlanguages like his own.  There were Phœnicians and Ægeans settled in\r\nSpain and North Africa, but those were very remote regions to his\r\nimagination.  Italy was still a desolate land covered with dense\r\nforests; the brown-skinned Etruscans had not yet gone there from Asia\r\nMinor.  And one day perhaps this Cretan gentleman went down to the\r\nharbour and saw a captive who attracted his attention because he was\r\nvery fair-complexioned and had blue eyes.  Perhaps our Cretan tried to\r\ntalk to him and was answered in an unintelligible gibberish.  This\r\ncreature came from somewhere beyond the Black Sea and seemed to be an\r\naltogether benighted savage.  But indeed he was an Aryan tribesman, of\r\na race and culture of which we shall soon have much to tell, and the\r\nstrange gibberish he spoke was to differentiate some day into Sanskrit,\r\nPersian, Greek, Latin, German, English and most of the chief languages\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PALACE AT CNOSSOS\r\nTHE PALACE AT CNOSSOS\r\n\r\nThe painted walls of the Throne Room\r\n\r\n_Photo: Fred Boissonnas_\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was Cnossos at its zenith, intelligent, enterprising, bright and\r\nhappy.  But about 1400 B.C. disaster came perhaps very suddenly upon\r\nits prosperity.  The palace of Minos was destroyed, and its ruins have\r\nnever been rebuilt or inhabited from that day to this. We do not know\r\nhow this disaster occurred.  The excavators note what appears to be\r\nscattered plunder and the marks of the fire.  But the traces of a very\r\ndestructive earthquake have also been found.  Nature alone may have\r\ndestroyed Cnossos, or the Greeks may have finished what the earthquake\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\nEGYPT, BABYLON AND ASSYRIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians had never submitted very willingly to the rule of their\r\nSemitic shepherd kings and about 1600 A.D. a vigorous patriotic\r\nmovement expelled these foreigners. Followed a new phase or revival for\r\nEgypt, a period known to Egyptologists as the New Empire. Egypt, which\r\nhad not been closely consolidated before the Hyksos invasion, was now a\r\nunited country; and the phase of subjugation and insurrection left her\r\nfull of military spirit. The Pharaohs became aggressive conquerors.\r\nThey had now acquired the war horse and the war chariot, which the\r\nHyksos had brought to them. Under Thothmes III and Amenophis III Egypt\r\nhad extended her rule into Asia as far as the Euphrates.\r\n\r\nWe are entering now upon a thousand years of warfare between the once\r\nquite separated civilizations of Mesopotamia and the Nile.  At first\r\nEgypt was ascendant.  The great dynasties, the Seventeenth Dynasty,\r\nwhich included Thothmes III and Amenophis III and IV and a great queen\r\nHatasu, and the Nineteenth, when Rameses II, supposed by some to have\r\nbeen the Pharaoh of Moses, reigned for sixty-seven years, raised Egypt\r\nto high levels of prosperity.  In between there were phases of\r\ndepression for Egypt, conquest by the Syrians and later conquest by the\r\nEthiopians from the South.  In Mesopotamia Babylon ruled, then the\r\nHittites and the Syrians of Damascus rose to a transitory predominance;\r\nat one time the Syrians conquered Egypt; the fortunes of the Assyrians\r\nof Nineveh ebbed and flowed; sometimes the city was a conquered city;\r\nsometimes the Assyrians ruled in Babylon and assailed Egypt.  Our space\r\nis too limited here to tell of the comings and goings of the armies of\r\nthe Egyptians and of the various Semitic powers of Asia Minor, Syria\r\nand Mesopotamia.  They were armies now provided with vast droves of war\r\nchariots, for the horse—still used only for war and glory—had spread by\r\nthis time into the old civilizations from Central Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPLE AT ABU SIMBEL\r\nTEMPLE AT ABU SIMBEL\r\n\r\nShowing the statues of Rameses II at entrance\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat conquerors appear in the dim light of that distant time and pass,\r\nTushratta, King of Mitanni, who captured Nineveh, Tiglath Pileser I of\r\nAssyria who conquered Babylon.  At last the Assyrians became the\r\ngreatest military power of the time. Tiglath Pileser III conquered\r\nBabylon in 745 B.C. and founded what historians call the New Assyrian\r\nEmpire.  Iron had also come now into civilization out of the north; the\r\nHittites, the precursors of the Armenians, had it first and\r\ncommunicated its use to the Assyrians, and an Assyrian usurper, Sargon\r\nII, armed his troops with it.  Assyria became the first power to\r\nexpound the doctrine of blood and iron.  Sargon’s son Sennacherib led\r\nan army to the borders of Egypt, and was defeated not by military\r\nstrength but by the plague. Sennacherib’s grandson Assurbanipal (who is\r\nalso known in history by his Greek name of Sardanapalus) did actually\r\nconquer Egypt in 670 B.C.  But Egypt was already a conquered country\r\nthen under an Ethiopian dynasty.  Sardanapalus simply replaced one\r\nconqueror by another.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVENUE OF SPHINXES\r\nAVENUE OF SPHINXES\r\n\r\nLeading from the Nile to the great Temple of Karnak\r\n\r\n_Photo: D. McLeish_\r\n\r\n\r\nIf one had a series of political maps of this long period of history,\r\nthis interval of ten centuries, we should have Egypt expanding and\r\ncontracting like an amœba under a microscope, and we should see these\r\nvarious Semitic states of the Babylonians, the Assyrians, the Hittites\r\nand the Syrians coming and going, eating each other up and disgorging\r\neach other again.  To the west of Asia Minor there would be little\r\nÆgean states like Lydia, whose capital was Sardis, and Caria.  But\r\nafter about 1200 B.C. and perhaps earlier, a new set of names would\r\ncome into the map of the ancient world from the north-east and from the\r\nnorth- west.  These would be the names of certain barbaric tribes,\r\narmed with iron weapons and using horse-chariots, who were becoming a\r\ngreat affliction to the Ægean and Semitic civilizations on the northern\r\nborders.  They all spoke variants of what once must have been the same\r\nlanguage, Aryan.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT HYPOSTYLE HALL AT KARNAK\r\nTHE GREAT HYPOSTYLE HALL AT KARNAK\r\n\r\n_Photo: D. McLeish_\r\n\r\n\r\nRound the north-east of the Black and Caspian Seas were coming the\r\nMedes and Persians.  Confused with these in the records of the time\r\nwere Scythians and Samatians.  From north-east or north-west came the\r\nArmenians, from the north- west of the sea-barrier through the Balkan\r\npeninsula came Cimmerians, Phrygians and the Hellenic tribes whom now\r\nwe call the Greeks.  They were raiders and robbers and plunderers of\r\ncities, these Ayrans, east and west alike. They were all kindred and\r\nsimilar peoples, hardy herdsmen who had taken to plunder.  In the east\r\nthey were still only borderers and raiders, but in the west they were\r\ntaking cities and driving out the civilized Ægean populations. The\r\nÆgean peoples were so pressed that they were seeking new homes in lands\r\nbeyond the Aryan range.  Some were seeking a settlement in the delta of\r\nthe Nile and being repulsed by the Egyptians; some, the Etruscans, seem\r\nto have sailed from Asia Minor to found a state in the forest\r\nwildernesses of middle Italy; some built themselves cities upon the\r\nsouth- east coasts of the Mediterranean and became later that people\r\nknown in history as the Philistines.\r\n\r\nOf these Aryans who came thus rudely upon the scene of the ancient\r\ncivilizations we will tell more fully in a later section.  Here we note\r\nsimply all this stir and emigration amidst the area of the ancient\r\ncivilizations, that was set up by the swirl of the gradual and\r\ncontinuous advance of these Aryan barbarians out of the northern\r\nforests and wildernesses between 1600 and 600 B.C.\r\n\r\nAnd in a section to follow we must tell also of a little Semitic\r\npeople, the Hebrews, in the hills behind the Phœnician and Philistine\r\ncoasts, who began to be of significance in the world towards the end of\r\nthis period. They produced a literature of very great importance in\r\nsubsequent history, a collection of books, histories, poems, books of\r\nwisdom and prophetic works, the Hebrew Bible.\r\n\r\nIn Mesopotamia and Egypt the coming of the Aryans did not cause\r\nfundamental changes until after 600 B.C.  The flight of the Ægeans\r\nbefore the Greeks and even the destruction of Cnossos must have seemed\r\na very remote disturbance to both the citizens of Egypt and of Babylon.\r\n Dynasties came and went in these cradle states of civilization, but\r\nthe main tenor of human life went on, with a slow increase in\r\nrefinement and complexity age by age.  In Egypt the accumulated\r\nmonuments of more ancient times—the pyramids were already in their\r\nthird thousand of years and a show for visitors just as they are to-\r\nday—were supplemented by fresh and splendid buildings, more\r\nparticularly in the time of the seventeenth and nineteenth dynasties. \r\nThe great temples at Karnak and Luxor date from this time.  All the\r\nchief monuments of Nineveh, the great temples, the winged bulls with\r\nhuman heads, the reliefs of kings and chariots and lion hunts, were\r\ndone in these centuries between 1600 and 600 B.C., and this period also\r\ncovers most of the splendours of Babylon.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEZE SHOWING EGYPTIAN FEMALE SLAVES CARRYING LUXURIOUS FOODS\r\nFRIEZE SHOWING EGYPTIAN FEMALE SLAVES CARRYING LUXURIOUS FOODS\r\n\r\n_Photo: Jacques Boyer_\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth from Mesopotamia and Egypt we now have abundant public records,\r\nbusiness accounts, stories, poetry and private correspondence.  We know\r\nthat life, for prosperous and influential people in such cities as\r\nBabylon and the Egyptian Thebes, was already almost as refined and as\r\nluxurious as that of comfortable and prosperous people to-day.  Such\r\npeople lived an orderly and ceremonious life in beautiful and\r\nbeautifully furnished and decorated houses, wore richly decorated\r\nclothing and lovely jewels; they had feasts and festivals, entertained\r\none another with music and dancing, were waited upon by highly trained\r\nservants, were cared for by doctors and dentists.  They did not travel\r\nvery much or very far, but boating excursions were a common summer\r\npleasure both on the Nile and on the Euphrates.  The beast of burthen\r\nwas the ass; the horse was still used only in chariots for war and upon\r\noccasions of state.  The mule was still novel and the camel, though it\r\nwas known in Mesopotamia, had not been brought into Egypt.  And there\r\nwere few utensils of iron; copper and bronze remained the prevailing\r\nmetals.  Fine linen and cotton fabrics were known as well as wool.  But\r\nthere was no silk yet.  Glass was known and beautifully coloured, but\r\nglass things were usually small.  There was no clear glass and no\r\noptical use of glass. People had gold stoppings in their teeth but no\r\nspectacles on their noses.\r\n\r\nOne odd contrast between the life of old Thebes or Babylon and modern\r\nlife was the absence of coined money.  Most trade was still done by\r\nbarter.  Babylon was financially far ahead of Egypt.  Gold and silver\r\nwere used for exchange and kept in ingots; and there were bankers,\r\nbefore coinage, who stamped their names and the weight on these lumps\r\nof precious metal. A merchant or traveller would carry precious stones\r\nto sell to pay for his necessities.  Most servants and workers were\r\nslaves who were paid not money but in kind.  As money came in slavery\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nA modern visitor to these crowning cities of the ancient world would\r\nhave missed two very important articles of diet; there were no hens and\r\nno eggs.  A French cook would have found small joy in Babylon.  These\r\nthings came from the East somewhere about the time of the last Assyrian\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nReligion like everything else had undergone great refinement. Human\r\nsacrifice for instance had long since disappeared; animals or bread\r\ndummies had been substituted for the victim. (But the Phœnicians and\r\nespecially the citizens of Carthage, their greatest settlement in\r\nAfrica, were accused, later of immolating human beings.)  When a great\r\nchief had died in the ancient days it had been customary to sacrifice\r\nhis wives and slaves and break spear and bow at his tomb so that he\r\nshould not go unattended and unarmed in the spirit world.  In Egypt\r\nthere survived of this dark tradition the pleasant custom of burying\r\nsmall models of house and shop and servants and cattle with the dead,\r\nmodels that give us to-day the liveliest realization of the safe and\r\ncultivated life of these ancient people, three thousand years and more\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLE OF HORUS AT EDFU\r\nTHE TEMPLE OF HORUS AT EDFU\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the ancient world before the coming of the Aryans out of the\r\nnorthern forests and plains.  In India and China there were parallel\r\ndevelopments.  In the great valleys of both these regions agricultural\r\ncity states of brownish peoples were growing up, but in India they do\r\nnot seem to have advanced or coalesced so rapidly as the city states of\r\nMesopotamia or Egypt.  They were nearer the level of the ancient\r\nSumerians or of the Maya civilization of America.  Chinese history has\r\nstill to be modernized by Chinese scholars and cleared of much\r\nlegendary matter.  Probably China at this time was in advance of India.\r\n Contemporary with the seventeenth dynasty in Egypt, there was a\r\ndynasty of emperors in China, the Shang dynasty, priest emperors over a\r\nloose-knit empire of subordinate kings.  The chief duty of these early\r\nemperors was to perform the seasonal sacrifices.  Beautiful bronze\r\nvessels from the time of the Shang dynasty still exist, and their\r\nbeauty and workmanship compel us to recognize that many centuries of\r\ncivilization must have preceded their manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\nTHE PRIMITIVE ARYANS\r\n\r\n\r\nFour thousand years ago, that is to say about 2000 B.C., central and\r\nsouth-eastern Europe and central Asia were probably warmer, moister and\r\nbetter wooded than they are now. In these regions of the earth wandered\r\na group of tribes mainly of the fair and blue-eyed Nordic race,\r\nsufficiently in touch with one another to speak merely variations of\r\none common language from the Rhine to the Caspian Sea. At that time\r\nthey may not have been a very numerous people, and their existence was\r\nunsuspected by the Babylonians to whom Hammurabi was giving laws, or by\r\nthe already ancient and cultivated land of Egypt which was tasting in\r\nthose days for the first time the bitterness of foreign conquest.\r\n\r\nThese Nordic people were destined to play a very important part indeed\r\nin the world’s history.  They were a people of the parklands and the\r\nforest clearings; they had no horses at first but they had cattle; when\r\nthey wandered they put their tents and other gear on rough ox waggons;\r\nwhen they settled for a time they may have made huts of wattle and mud.\r\nThey burnt their important dead; they did not bury them ceremoniously\r\nas the brunette peoples did.  They put the ashes of their greater\r\nleaders in urns and then made a great circular mound about them.  These\r\nmounds are the “round barrows” that occur all over north Europe.  The\r\nbrunette people, their predecessors, did not burn their dead but buried\r\nthem in a sitting position in elongated mounds; the “long barrows.”\r\n\r\nThe Aryans raised crops of wheat, ploughing with oxen, but they did not\r\nsettle down by their crops; they would reap and move on.  They had\r\nbronze, and somewhen about 1500 B.C. they acquired iron.  They may have\r\nbeen the discoverers of iron smelting.  And somewhen vaguely about that\r\ntime they also got the horse—which to begin with they used only for\r\ndraught purposes.  Their social life did not centre upon a temple like\r\nthat of the more settled people round the Mediterranean, and their\r\nchief men were leaders rather than priests.  They had an aristocratic\r\nsocial order rather than a divine and regal order; from a very early\r\nstage they distinguished certain families as leaderly and noble.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BEAUTIFUL ARCHAIC AMPHORA\r\nA BEAUTIFUL ARCHAIC AMPHORA\r\n\r\nCompare the horses and other animals with the Altamira drawing on p.\r\n54, and also with the Greek frieze, p. 140\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were a very vocal people.  They enlivened their wanderings by\r\nfeasts, at which there was much drunkenness and at which a special sort\r\nof man, the bards, would sing and recite.  They had no writing until\r\nthey had come into contact with civilization, and the memories of these\r\nbards were their living literature.  This use of recited language as an\r\nentertainment did much to make it a fine and beautiful instrument of\r\nexpression, and to that no doubt the subsequent predominance of the\r\nlanguages derived from Aryan is, in part, to be ascribed.  Every Aryan\r\npeople had its legendary history crystallized in bardic recitations,\r\nepics, sagas and vedas, as they were variously called.\r\n\r\nThe social life of these people centred about the households of their\r\nleading men.  The hall of the chief where they settled for a time was\r\noften a very capacious timber building.  There were no doubt huts for\r\nherds and outlying farm buildings; but with most of the Aryan peoples\r\nthis hall was the general centre, everyone went there to feast and hear\r\nthe bards and take part in games and discussions.  Cowsheds and\r\nstabling surrounded it.  The chief and his wife and so forth would\r\nsleep on a dais or in an upper gallery; the commoner sort slept about\r\nanywhere, as people still do in Indian households.  Except for weapons,\r\nornaments, tools and suchlike personal possessions there was a sort of\r\npatriarchal communism in the tribe.  The chief owned the cattle and\r\ngrazing lands in the common interest; forest and rivers were the wild.\r\n\r\nThis was the fashion of the people who were increasing and multiplying\r\nover the great spaces of central Europe and west central Asia during\r\nthe growth of the great civilization of Mesopotamia and the Nile, and\r\nwhom we find pressing upon the heliolithic peoples everywhere in the\r\nsecond millennium before Christ.  They were coming into France and\r\nBritain and into Spain.  They pushed westward in two waves.  The first\r\nof these people who reached Britain and Ireland were armed with bronze\r\nweapons.  They exterminated or subjugated the people who had made the\r\ngreat stone monuments of Carnac in Brittany and Stonehenge and Avebury\r\nin England.  They reached Ireland. They are called the Goidelic Celts.\r\nThe second wave of a closely kindred people, perhaps intermixed with\r\nother racial elements, brought iron with it into Great Britain, and is\r\nknown as the wave of Brythonic Celts.  From them the Welsh derive their\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUND OF NIPPUR\r\nTHE MOUND OF NIPPUR\r\n\r\nThe site of a city which recent excavations have proved to date from at\r\nleast as early as 5000 B.C., and probably 1000 years earlier\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Underwood & Underwood_\r\n\r\n\r\nKindred Celtic peoples were pressing southward into Spain and coming\r\ninto contact not only with the heliolithic Basque people who still\r\noccupied the country but with the Semitic Phœnician colonies of the sea\r\ncoast.  A closely allied series of tribes, the Italians, were making\r\ntheir way down the still wild and wooded Italian peninsula.  They did\r\nnot always conquer.  In the eighth century B.C.  Rome appears in\r\nhistory, a trading town on the Tiber, inhabited by Aryan Latins but\r\nunder the rule of Etruscan nobles and kings.\r\n\r\nAt the other extremity of the Aryan range there was a similar progress\r\nsouthward of similar tribes.  Aryan peoples, speaking Sanskrit, had\r\ncome down through the western passes into North India long before 1000\r\nB.C.  There they came into contact with a primordial brunette\r\ncivilization, the Dravidian civilization, and learnt much from it. \r\nOther Aryan tribes seem to have spread over the mountain masses of\r\nCentral Asia far to the east of the present range of such peoples.  In\r\nEastern Turkestan there are still fair, blue-eyed Nordic tribes, but\r\nnow they speak Mongolian tongues.\r\n\r\nBetween the Black and Caspian Seas the ancient Hittites had been\r\nsubmerged and “Aryanized” by the Armenians before 1000 B.C., and the\r\nAssyrians and Babylonians were already aware of a new and formidable\r\nfighting barbarism on the north-eastern frontiers, a group of tribes\r\namidst which the Scythians, the Medes and the Persians remain as\r\noutstanding names.\r\n\r\nBut it was through the Balkan peninsula that Aryan tribes made their\r\nfirst heavy thrust into the heart of the old-world civilization.  They\r\nwere already coming southward and crossing into Asia Minor many\r\ncenturies before 1000 B.C.  First came a group of tribes of whom the\r\nPhrygians were the most conspicuous, and then in succession the Æolic,\r\nthe Ionic and the Dorian Greeks. By 1000 B.C. they had wiped out the\r\nancient Ægean civilization both in the mainland of Greece and in most\r\nof the Greek islands; the cities of Mycenæ and Tiryns were obliterated\r\nand Cnossos was nearly forgotten.  The Greeks had taken to the sea\r\nbefore 1000 A.D., they had settled in Crete and Rhodes, and they were\r\nfounding colonies in Sicily and the south of Italy after the fashion of\r\nthe Phœnician trading cities that were dotted along the Mediterranean\r\ncoasts.\r\n\r\nSo it was, while Tiglath Pileser III and Sargon II and Sardanapalus\r\nwere ruling in Assyria and fighting with Babylonia and Syria and Egypt,\r\nthe Aryan peoples were learning the methods of civilization and making\r\nit over for their own purposes in Italy and Greece and north Persia. \r\nThe theme of history from the ninth century B.C. A.D. onward for six\r\ncenturies is the story of how these Aryan peoples grew to power and\r\nenterprise and how at last they subjugated the whole Ancient World,\r\nSemitic, Ægean and Egyptian alike.  In form the Aryan peoples were\r\naltogether victorious; but the struggle of Aryan, Semitic and Egyptian\r\nideas and methods was continued long after the sceptre was in Aryan\r\nhands.  It is indeed a struggle that goes on through all the rest of\r\nhistory and still in a manner continues to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\nTHE LAST BABYLONIAN EMPIRE AND THE EMPIRE OF DARIUS I\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned how Assyria became a great military power\r\nunder Tiglath Pileser III and under the usurper Sargon II. Sargon was\r\nnot this man’s original name; he adopted it to flatter the conquered\r\nBabylonians by reminding them of that ancient founder of the Akkadian\r\nEmpire, Sargon I, two thousand years before his time. Babylon, for all\r\nthat it was a conquered city, was of greater population and importance\r\nthan Nineveh, and its great god Bel Marduk and its traders and priests\r\nhad to be treated politely. In Mesopotamia in the eighth century B.C.\r\nA.D. we are already far beyond the barbaric days when the capture of a\r\ntown meant loot and massacre. Conquerors sought to propitiate and win\r\nthe conquered. For a century and a half after Sargon the new Assyrian\r\nempire endured and, as we have noted, Assurbanipal (Sardanapalus) held\r\nat least lower Egypt.\r\n\r\nBut the power and solidarity of Assyria waned rapidly.  Egypt by an\r\neffort threw off the foreigner under a Pharoah Psammetichus I, and\r\nunder Necho II attempted a war of conquest in Syria.  By that time\r\nAssyria was grappling with foes nearer at hand, and could make but a\r\npoor resistance.  A Semitic people from south-east Mesopotamia, the\r\nChaldeans, combined with Aryan Medes and Persians from the north-east\r\nagainst Nineveh, and in 606 B.C.—for now we are coming down to exact\r\nchronology—took that city.\r\n\r\nThere was a division of the spoils of Assyria.  A Median Empire was set\r\nup in the north under Cyaxares.   It included Nineveh, and its capital\r\nwas Ecbatana.  Eastward it reached to the borders of India.  To the\r\nsouth of this in a great crescent was a new Chaldean Empire, the Second\r\nBabylonian Empire, which rose to a very great degree of wealth and\r\npower under the rule of Nebuchadnezzar the Great (the Nebuchadnezzar of\r\nthe Bible). The last great days, the greatest days of all, for Babylon\r\nbegan.  For a time the two Empires remained at peace, and the daughter\r\nof Nebuchadnezzar was married to Cyaxares.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Necho II was pursuing his easy conquests in Syria. He had\r\ndefeated and slain King Josiah of Judah, a small country of which there\r\nis more to tell presently, at the battle of Megiddo in 608 B.C., and he\r\npushed on to the Euphrates to encounter not a decadent Assyria but a\r\nrenascent Babylonia.  The Chaldeans dealt very vigorously with the\r\nEgyptians.  Necho was routed and driven back to Egypt, and the\r\nBabylonian frontier pushed down to the ancient Egyptian boundaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap showing the relation of the Median and Second Babylonian (Chaldæan)\r\nEmpires in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar the Great\r\n\r\nFrom 606 until 589 B.C. the Second Babylonian Empire flourished\r\ninsecurely.  It flourished so long as it kept the peace with the\r\nstronger, hardier Median Empire to the north.  And during these\r\nsixty-seven years not only life but learning flourished in the ancient\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: The Empire of Darius (tribute-paying countries) at its greatest\r\nextent\r\n\r\nEven under the Assyrian monarchs and especially under Sardanapalus,\r\nBabylon had been a scene of great intellectual activity.  Sardanapalus,\r\nthough an Assyrian, had been quite Babylon-ized.  He made a library, a\r\nlibrary not of paper but of the clay tablets that were used for writing\r\nin Mesopotamia since early Sumerian days.  His collection has been\r\nunearthed and is perhaps the most precious store of historical material\r\nin the world.  The last of the Chaldean line of Babylonian monarchs,\r\nNabonidus, had even keener literary tastes.  He patronized antiquarian\r\nresearches, and when a date was worked out by his investigators for the\r\naccession of Sargon I he commemorated the fact by inscriptions.  But\r\nthere were many signs of disunion in his empire, and he sought to\r\ncentralize it by bringing a number of the various local gods to Babylon\r\nand setting up temples to them there.  This device was to be practised\r\nquite successfully by the Romans in later times, but in Babylon it\r\nroused the jealousy of the powerful priesthood of Bel Marduk, the\r\ndominant god of the Babylonians.  They cast about for a possible\r\nalternative to Nabonidus and found it in Cyrus the Persian, the ruler\r\nof the adjacent Median Empire.  Cyrus had already distinguished himself\r\nby conquering Croesus, the rich king of Lydia in Eastern Asia Minor. \r\nHe came up against Babylon, there was a battle outside the walls, and\r\nthe gates of the city were opened to him (538 B.C.).  His soldiers\r\nentered the city without fighting.  The crown prince Belshazzar, the\r\nson of Nabonidus, was feasting, the Bible relates, when a hand appeared\r\nand wrote in letters of fire upon the wall these mystical words: \r\n_“Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin,”_ which was interpreted by the prophet\r\nDaniel, whom he summoned to read the riddle, as “God has numbered thy\r\nkingdom and finished it; thou art weighed in the balance and found\r\nwanting and thy kingdom is given to the Medes and Persians.”  Possibly\r\nthe priests of Bel Marduk knew something about that writing on the\r\nwall. Belshazzar was killed that night, says the Bible.  Nabonidus was\r\ntaken prisoner, and the occupation of the city was so peaceful that the\r\nservices of Bel Marduk continued without intermission.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSIAN MONARCH\r\nPERSIAN MONARCH\r\n\r\nFrom the ruins of Persepolis\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Miss F. Biggs_\r\n\r\n\r\nThus it was the Babylonian and Median empires were united. Cambyses,\r\nthe son of Cyrus, subjugated Egypt.  Cambyses went mad and was\r\naccidentally killed, and was presently succeeded by Darius the Mede,\r\nDarius I, the son of Hystaspes, one of the chief councillors of Cyrus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUINS OF PERSEPOLIS\r\nTHE RUINS OF PERSEPOLIS\r\n\r\nThe capital city of the Persian Empire; burnt by Alexander the Great\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Major W.

Rodd_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Persian Empire of Darius I, the first of the new Aryan empires in\r\nthe seat of the old civilizations, was the greatest empire the world\r\nhad hitherto seen.  It included all Asia Minor and Syria, all the old\r\nAssyrian and Babylonian empires, Egypt, the Caucasus and Caspian\r\nregions, Media, Persia, and it extended into India as far as the Indus.\r\n Such an empire was possible because the horse and rider and the\r\nchariot and the made-road had now been brought into the world. \r\nHitherto the ass and ox and the camel for desert use had afforded the\r\nswiftest method of transport.  Great arterial roads were made by the\r\nPersian rulers to hold their new empire, and post horses were always in\r\nwaiting for the imperial messenger or the traveller with an official\r\npermit.  Moreover the world was now beginning to use coined money,\r\nwhich greatly facilitated trade and intercourse.  But the capital of\r\nthis vast empire was no longer Babylon.  In the long run the priesthood\r\nof Bel Marduk gained nothing by their treason. Babylon though still\r\nimportant was now a declining city, and the great cities of the new\r\nempire were Persepolis and Susa and Ecbatana.  The capital was Susa. \r\nNineveh was already abandoned and sinking into ruins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\nTHE EARLY HISTORY OF THE JEWS\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now we can tell of the Hebrews, a Semitic people, not so important\r\nin their own time as in their influence upon the later history of the\r\nworld. They were settled in Judea long before 1000 B.C., and their\r\ncapital city after that time was Jerusalem. Their story is interwoven\r\nwith that of the great empires on either side of them, Egypt to the\r\nsouth and the changing empires of Syria, Assyria and Babylon to the\r\nnorth. Their country was an inevitable high road between these latter\r\npowers and Egypt.\r\n\r\nTheir importance in the world is due to the fact that they produced a\r\nwritten literature, a world history, a collection of laws, chronicles,\r\npsalms, books of wisdom, poetry and fiction and political utterances\r\nwhich became at last what Christians know as the Old Testament, the\r\nHebrew Bible.  This literature appears in history in the fourth or\r\nfifth century B.C.\r\n\r\nProbably this literature was first put together in Babylon. We have\r\nalready told how the Pharaoh, Necho II, invaded the Assyrian Empire\r\nwhile Assyria was fighting for life against Medes, Persians and\r\nChaldeans.  Josiah King of Judah opposed him, and was defeated and\r\nslain at Megiddo (608 B.C.).  Judah became a tributary to Egypt, and\r\nwhen Nebuchadnezzar the Great, the new Chaldean king in Babylon, rolled\r\nback Necho into Egypt, he attempted to manage Judah by setting up\r\npuppet kings in Jerusalem.  The experiment failed, the people massacred\r\nhis Babylonian officials, and he then determined to break up this\r\nlittle state altogether, which had long been playing off Egypt against\r\nthe northern empire.  Jerusalem was sacked and burnt, and the remnant\r\nof the people was carried off captive to Babylon.\r\n\r\nThere they remained until Cyrus took Babylon (538 B.C.).  He then\r\ncollected them together and sent them back to resettle their country\r\nand rebuild the walls and temple of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nBefore that time the Jews do not seem to have been a very civilized or\r\nunited people.  Probably only a very few of them could read or write. \r\nIn their own history one never hears of the early books of the Bible\r\nbeing read; the first mention of a book is in the time of Josiah.  The\r\nBabylonian captivity civilized them and consolidated them.  They\r\nreturned aware of their own literature, an acutely self-conscious and\r\npolitical people.\r\n\r\nTheir Bible at that time seems to have consisted only of the\r\nPentateuch, that is to say the first five books of the Old Testament as\r\nwe know it.  In addition, as separate books they already had many of\r\nthe other books that have since been incorporated with the Pentateuch\r\ninto the present Hebrew Bible, Chronicles, the Psalms and Proverbs for\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the Creation of the World, of Adam and Eve and of the\r\nFlood, with which the Bible begins, run closely parallel with similar\r\nBabylonian legends; they seem to have been part of the common beliefs\r\nof all the Semitic peoples. So too the stories of Moses and of Samson\r\nhave Sumerian and Babylonian parallels.  But with the story of Abraham\r\nand onward begins something more special to the Jewish race.\r\n\r\nAbraham may have lived as early as the days of Hammurabi in Babylon. \r\nHe was a patriarchal Semitic nomad.  To the book of Genesis the reader\r\nmust go for the story of his wanderings and for the stories of his sons\r\nand grandchildren and how they became captive in the Land of Egypt.  He\r\ntravelled through Canaan, and the God of Abraham, says the Bible story,\r\npromised this smiling land of prosperous cities to him and to his\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAnd after a long sojourn in Egypt and after fifty years of wandering in\r\nthe wilderness under the leadership of Moses, the children of Abraham,\r\ngrown now to a host of twelve tribes, invaded the land of Canaan from\r\nthe Arabian deserts to the East.  They may have done this somewhen\r\nbetween 1600 B.C. and 1300 B.C.; there are no Egyptian records of Moses\r\nnor of Canaan at this time to help out the story.  But at any rate they\r\ndid not succeed in conquering any more than the hilly backgrounds of\r\nthe promised land.  The coast was now in the hands, not of the\r\nCanaanites but of newcomers, those Ægean peoples, the Philistines; and\r\ntheir cities, Gaza, Gath, Ashdod, Ascalon and Joppa successfully\r\nwithstood the Hebrew attack.  For many generations the children of\r\nAbraham remained an obscure people of the hilly back country engaged in\r\nincessant bickerings with the Philistines and with the kindred tribes\r\nabout them, the Moabites, the Midianites and so forth.  The reader will\r\nfind in the book of Judges a record of their struggles and disasters\r\nduring this period. For very largely it is a record of disasters and\r\nfailures frankly told.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: The Land of the Hebrews\r\n\r\nFor most of this period the Hebrews were ruled, so far as there was any\r\nrule among them, by priestly judges selected by the elders of the\r\npeople, but at last somewhen towards 1000 B.C. they chose themselves a\r\nking, Saul, to lead them in battle.  But Saul’s leading was no great\r\nimprovement upon the leading of the Judges; he perished under the hail\r\nof Philistine arrows at the battle of Mount Gilboa, his armour went\r\ninto the temple of the Philistine Venus, and his body was nailed to the\r\nwalls of Beth-shan.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUND AT BABYLON\r\nTHE MOUND AT BABYLON\r\n\r\nBeneath which are the remains of a great palace of Nebuchadnezzar\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Underwood & Underwood_\r\n\r\n\r\nHis successor David was more successful and more politic. With David\r\ndawned the only period of prosperity the Hebrew peoples were ever to\r\nknow.  It was based on a close alliance with the Phœnician city of\r\nTyre, whose King Hiram seems to have been a man of very great\r\nintelligence and enterprise. He wished to secure a trade route to the\r\nRed Sea through the Hebrew hill country.  Normally Phœnician trade went\r\nto the Red Sea by Egypt, but Egypt was in a state of profound disorder\r\nat this time; there may have been other obstructions to Phœnician trade\r\nalong this line, and at any rate Hiram established the very closest\r\nrelations both with David and with his son and successor Solomon. \r\nUnder Hiram’s auspices the walls, palace and temple of Jerusalem arose,\r\nand in return Hiram built and launched his ships on the Red Sea.  A\r\nvery considerable trade passed northward and southward through\r\nJerusalem.  And Solomon achieved a prosperity and magnificence\r\nunprecedented in the experience of his people.  He was even given a\r\ndaughter of Pharaoh in marriage.\r\n\r\nBut it is well to keep the proportion of things in mind.  At the climax\r\nof his glories Solomon was only a little subordinate king in a little\r\ncity.  His power was so transitory that within a few years of his\r\ndeath, Shishak the first Pharaoh of the twenty-second dynasty, had\r\ntaken Jerusalem and looted most of its splendours.  The account of\r\nSolomon’s magnificence given in the books of Kings and Chronicles is\r\nquestioned by many critics.  They say that it was added to and\r\nexaggerated by the patriotic pride of later writers.  But the Bible\r\naccount read carefully is not so overwhelming as it appears at the\r\nfirst reading. Solomon’s temple, if one works out the measurements,\r\nwould go inside a small suburban church, and his fourteen hundred\r\nchariots cease to impress us when we learn from an Assyrian monument\r\nthat his successor Ahab sent a contingent of two thousand to the\r\nAssyrian army.  It is also plainly manifest from the Bible narrative\r\nthat Solomon spent himself in display and overtaxed and overworked his\r\npeople.  At his death the northern part of his kingdom broke off from\r\nJerusalem and became the independent kingdom of Israel. Jerusalem\r\nremained the capital city of Judah.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISHTAR GATEWAY, BABYLON\r\nTHE ISHTAR GATEWAY, BABYLON\r\n\r\nThe bulls are in richly coloured enamel on baked brick\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Underwood & Underwood_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of the Hebrew people was short-lived.  Hiram died, and\r\nthe help of Tyre ceased to strengthen Jerusalem. Egypt grew strong\r\nagain.  The history of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah\r\nbecomes a history of two little states ground between, first, Syria,\r\nthen Assyria and then Babylon to the north and Egypt to the south.  It\r\nis a tale of disasters and of deliverances that only delayed disaster. \r\nIt is a tale of barbaric kings ruling a barbaric people. In 721 B.C.\r\nthe kingdom of Israel was swept away into captivity by the Assyrians\r\nand its people utterly lost to history.  Judah struggled on until in\r\n604 B.C., as we have told, it shared the fate of Israel.  There may be\r\ndetails open to criticism in the Bible story of Hebrew history from the\r\ndays of the Judges onward, but on the whole it is evidently a true\r\nstory which squares with all that has been learnt in the excavation of\r\nEgypt and Assyria and Babylon during the past century.\r\n\r\nIt was in Babylon that the Hebrew people got their history together and\r\nevolved their tradition.  The people who came back to Jerusalem at the\r\ncommand of Cyrus were a very different people in spirit and knowledge\r\nfrom those who had gone into captivity.  They had learnt civilization. \r\nIn the development of their peculiar character a very great part was\r\nplayed by certain men, a new sort of men, the Prophets, to whom we must\r\nnow direct our attention.  These Prophets mark the appearance of new\r\nand remarkable forces in the steady development of human society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\nPRIESTS AND PROPHETS IN JUDEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fall of Assyria and Babylon were only the first of a series of\r\ndisasters that were to happen to the Semitic peoples. In the seventh\r\ncentury B.C. it would have seemed as though the whole civilized world\r\nwas to be dominated by Semitic rulers. They ruled the great Assyrian\r\nempire and they had conquered Egypt; Assyria, Babylon, Syria were all\r\nSemitic, speaking languages that were mutually intelligible. The trade\r\nof the world was in Semitic hands. Tyre, Sidon, the great mother cities\r\nof the Phœnician coast, had thrown out colonies that grew at last to\r\neven greater proportion in Spain, Sicily and Africa. Carthage, founded\r\nbefore 800 B.C., had risen to a population of more than a million. It\r\nwas for a time the greatest city on earth. Its ships went to Britain\r\nand out into the Atlantic. They may have reached Madeira. We have\r\nalready noted how Hiram co-operated with Solomon to build ships on the\r\nRed Sea for the Arabian and perhaps for the Indian trade. In the time\r\nof the Pharaoh Necho, a Phœnician expedition sailed completely round\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nAt that time the Aryan peoples were still barbarians.  Only the Greeks\r\nwere reconstructing a new civilization of the ruins of the one they had\r\ndestroyed, and the Medes were becoming “formidable,” as an Assyrian\r\ninscription calls them, in central Asia.  In 800 B.C. no one could have\r\nprophesied that before the third century B.C. every trace of Semitic\r\ndominion would be wiped out by Aryan-speaking conquerors, and that\r\neverywhere the Semitic peoples would be subjects or tributaries or\r\nscattered altogether.  Everywhere except in the northern deserts of\r\nArabia, where the Bedouin adhered steadily to the nomadic way of life,\r\nthe ancient way of life of the Semites before Sargon I and his\r\nAkkadians went down to conquer Sumeria.  But the Arab Bedouin were\r\nnever conquered by Aryan masters.\r\n\r\nNow of all these civilized Semites who were beaten and overrun in these\r\nfive eventful centuries one people only held together and clung to its\r\nancient traditions and that was this little people, the Jews, who were\r\nsent back to build their city of Jerusalem by Cyrus the Persian.  And\r\nthey were able to do this, because they had got together this\r\nliterature of theirs, their Bible, in Babylon.  It is not so much the\r\nJews who made the Bible as the Bible which made the Jews.  Running\r\nthrough this Bible were certain ideas, different from the ideas of the\r\npeople about them, very stimulating and sustaining ideas, to which they\r\nwere destined to cling through five and twenty centuries of hardship,\r\nadventure and oppression.\r\n\r\nForemost of these Jewish ideas was this, that their God was invisible\r\nand remote, an invisible God in a temple not made with hands, a Lord of\r\nRighteousness throughout the earth. All other peoples had national gods\r\nembodied in images that lived in temples.  If the image was smashed and\r\nthe temple razed, presently that god died out.  But this was a new\r\nidea, this God of the Jews, in the heavens, high above priests and\r\nsacrifices.  And this God of Abraham, the Jews believed, had chosen\r\nthem to be his peculiar people, to restore Jerusalem and make it the\r\ncapital of Righteousness in the World.  They were a people exalted by\r\ntheir sense of a common destiny. This belief saturated them all when\r\nthey returned to Jerusalem after the captivity in Babylon.\r\n\r\nIs it any miracle that in their days of overthrow and subjugation many\r\nBabylonians and Syrians and so forth and later on many Phœnicians,\r\nspeaking practically the same language and having endless customs,\r\nhabits, tastes and traditions in common, should be attracted by this\r\ninspiring cult and should seek to share in its fellowship and its\r\npromise?  After the fall of Tyre, Sidon, Carthage and the Spanish\r\nPhœnician cities, the Phœnicians suddenly vanish from history; and as\r\nsuddenly we find, not simply in Jerusalem but in Spain, Africa, Egypt,\r\nArabia, the East, wherever the Phœnicians had set their feet,\r\ncommunities of Jews.  And they were all held together by the Bible and\r\nby the reading of the Bible.  Jerusalem was from the first only their\r\nnominal capital; their real city was this book of books.  This is a new\r\nsort of thing in history.  It is something of which the seeds were sown\r\nlong before, when the Sumerians and Egyptians began to turn their\r\nhieroglyphics into writing.  The Jews were a new thing, a people\r\nwithout a king and presently without a temple (for as we shall tell\r\nJerusalem itself was broken up in 70 A.D.), held together and\r\nconsolidated out of heterogeneous elements by nothing but the power of\r\nthe written word.\r\n\r\nAnd this mental welding of the Jews was neither planned nor foreseen\r\nnor done by either priests or statesmen.  Not only a new kind of\r\ncommunity but a new kind of man comes into history with the development\r\nof the Jews.  In the days of Solomon the Hebrews looked like becoming a\r\nlittle people just like any other little people of that time clustering\r\naround court and temple, ruled by the wisdom of the priest and led by\r\nthe ambition of the king.  But already, the reader may learn from the\r\nBible, this new sort of man of which we speak, the Prophet, was in\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nAs troubles thicken round the divided Hebrews the importance of these\r\nProphets increases.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK OBELISK OF SHALMANESER II\r\nTHE BLACK OBELISK OF SHALMANESER II\r\n\r\nThis obelisk (in the British Museum) of the King of Assyria mentions,\r\nin cuneiform, “Jehu the son of Omri.”  Panel showing Jewish captives\r\nbringing tribute\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat were these Prophets?  They were men of the most diverse origins. \r\nThe Prophet Ezekiel was of the priestly caste and the Prophet Amos wore\r\nthe goatskin mantle of a shepherd, but all had this in common, that\r\nthey gave allegiance to no one but to the God of Righteousness and that\r\nthey spoke directly to the people.  They came without licence or\r\nconsecration.  “Now the word of the Lord came unto me;” that was the\r\nformula.  They were intensely political.  They exhorted the people\r\nagainst Egypt, “that broken reed,” or against Assyria or Babylon; they\r\ndenounced the indolence of the priestly order or the flagrant sins of\r\nthe King.  Some of them turned their attention to what we should now\r\ncall “social reform.”  The rich were “grinding the faces of the poor,”\r\nthe luxurious were consuming the children’s bread; wealthy people made\r\nfriends with and imitated the splendours and vices of foreigners; and\r\nthis was hateful to Jehovah, the God of Abraham, who would certainly\r\npunish this land.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER PANEL OF THE BLACK OBELISK\r\nANOTHER PANEL OF THE BLACK OBELISK\r\n\r\nCaptive Princes making obeisance to Shalmaneser II\r\n\r\n\r\nThese fulminations were written down and preserved and studied.  They\r\nwent wherever the Jews went, and wherever they went they spread a new\r\nreligious spirit.  They carried the common man past priest and temple,\r\npast court and king and brought him face to face with the Rule of\r\nRighteousness. That is their supreme importance in the history of\r\nmankind. In the great utterances of Isaiah the prophetic voice rises to\r\na pitch of splendid anticipation and foreshadows the whole earth united\r\nand at peace under one God.  Therein the Jewish prophecies culminate.\r\n\r\nAll the Prophets did not speak in this fashion, and the intelligent\r\nreader of the prophetic books will find much hate in them, much\r\nprejudice, and much that will remind him of the propaganda pamphlets of\r\nthe present time.  Nevertheless it is the Hebrew Prophets of the period\r\nround and about the Babylonian captivity who mark the appearance of a\r\nnew power in the world, the power of individual moral appeal, of an\r\nappeal to the free conscience of mankind against the fetish sacrifices\r\nand slavish loyalties that had hitherto bridled and harnessed our race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\nTHE GREEKS\r\n\r\n\r\nNow while after Solomon (whose reign was probably about 960 B.C.) the\r\ndivided kingdoms of Israel and Judah were suffering destruction and\r\ndeportation, and while the Jewish people were developing their\r\ntradition in captivity in Babylon, another great power over the human\r\nmind, the Greek tradition, was also arising. While the Hebrew prophets\r\nwere working out a new sense of direct moral responsibility between the\r\npeople and an eternal and universal God of Right, the Greek\r\nphilosophers were training the human mind in a new method and spirit of\r\nintellectual adventure.\r\n\r\nThe Greek tribes as we have told were a branch of the Aryan- speaking\r\nstem. They had come down among the Ægean cities and islands some\r\ncenturies before 1000 B.C.  They were probably already in southward\r\nmovement before the Pharaoh Thothmes hunted his first elephants beyond\r\nthe conquered Euphrates.  For in those days there were elephants in\r\nMesopotamia and lions in Greece.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that it was a Greek raid that burnt Cnossos, but there\r\nare no Greek legends of such a victory though there are stories of\r\nMinos and his palace (the Labyrinth) and of the skill of the Cretan\r\nartificers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATUE OF MELEAGER\r\nSTATUE OF MELEAGER\r\n\r\nNote the progress in plastic power from the earlier wooden statue on\r\nleft\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Sebah & Foaillier_\r\n\r\n\r\nLike most of the Aryans these Greeks had singers and reciters whose\r\nperformances were an important social link, and these handed down from\r\nthe barbaric beginnings of their people two great epics, the _Iliad_,\r\ntelling how a league of Greek tribes besieged and took and sacked the\r\ntown of Troy in Asia Minor, and the _Odyssey_, being a long adventure\r\nstory of the return of the sage captain, Odysseus, from Troy to his own\r\nisland.  These epics were written down somewhen in the eighth or\r\nseventh century B.C., when the Greeks had acquired the use of an\r\nalphabet from their more civilized neighbours, but they are supposed to\r\nhave been in existence very much earlier.  Formerly they were ascribed\r\nto a particular blind bard, Homer, who was supposed to have sat down\r\nand composed them as Milton composed Paradise Lost. Whether there\r\nreally was such a poet, whether he composed or only wrote down and\r\npolished these epics and so forth, is a favourite quarrelling ground\r\nfor the erudite.  We need not concern ourselves with such bickerings\r\nhere.  The thing that matters from our point of view is that the Greeks\r\nwere in possession of their epics in the eighth century B.C., and that\r\nthey were a common possession and a link between their various tribes,\r\ngiving them a sense of fellowship as against the outer barbarians. \r\nThey were a group of kindred peoples linked by the spoken and\r\nafterwards by the written word, and sharing common ideals of courage\r\nand behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe epics showed the Greeks a barbaric people without iron, without\r\nwriting, and still not living in cities.  They seem to have lived at\r\nfirst in open villages of huts around the halls of their chiefs outside\r\nthe ruins of the Ægean cities they had destroyed.  Then they began to\r\nwall their cities and to adopt the idea of temples from the people they\r\nhad conquered.  It has been said that the cities of the primitive\r\ncivilizations grew up about the altar of some tribal god, and that the\r\nwall was added; in the cities of the Greeks the wall preceded the\r\ntemple.  They began to trade and send out colonies.  By the seventh\r\ncentury B.C. a new series of cities had grown up in the valleys and\r\nislands of Greece, forgetful of the Ægean cities and civilization that\r\nhad preceded them; Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Thebes, Samos, Miletus\r\namong the chief. There were already Greek settlements along the coast\r\nof the Black Sea and in Italy and Sicily.  The heel and toe of Italy\r\nwas called Magna Græcia.  Marseilles was a Greek town established on\r\nthe site of an earlier Phœnician colony.\r\n\r\nNow countries which are great plains or which have as a chief means of\r\ntransport some great river like the Euphrates or Nile tend to become\r\nunited under some common rule.  The cities of Egypt and the cities of\r\nSumeria, for example, ran together under one system of government. But\r\nthe Greek peoples were cut up among islands and mountain valleys; both\r\nGreece and Magna Græcia are very mountainous; and the tendency was all\r\nthe other way.  When the Greeks come into history they are divided up\r\ninto a number of little states which showed no signs of coalescence. \r\nThey are different even in race.  Some consist chiefly of citizens of\r\nthis or that Greek tribe, Ionic, Æolian or Doric; some have a mingled\r\npopulation of Greeks and descendants of the pre-Greek “Mediterranean”\r\nfolk; some have an unmixed free citizenship of Greeks lording it over\r\nan enslaved conquered population like the “Helots” in Sparta.  In some\r\nthe old leaderly Aryan families have become a close aristocracy; in\r\nsome there is a democracy of all the Aryan citizens; in some there are\r\nelected or even hereditary kings, in some usurpers or tyrants.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUINS OF THE GREAT TEMPLE OF ZEUS AT OLYMPIA\r\nRUINS OF THE GREAT TEMPLE OF ZEUS AT OLYMPIA\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Fred Boissonnas_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the same geographical conditions that kept the Greek states divided\r\nand various, kept them small.  The largest states were smaller than\r\nmany English counties, and it is doubtful if the population of any of\r\ntheir cities ever exceeded a third of a million.  Few came up even to\r\n50,000. There were unions of interest and sympathy but no coalescences.\r\n Cities made leagues and alliances as trade increased, and small cities\r\nput themselves under the protection of great ones.  Yet all Greece was\r\nheld together in a certain community of feeling by two things, by the\r\nepics and by the custom of taking part every fourth year in the\r\nathletic contests at Olympia.  This did not prevent wars and feuds, but\r\nit mitigated something of the savagery of war between them, and a truce\r\nprotected all travellers to and from the games.  As time went on the\r\nsentiment of a common heritage grew and the number of states\r\nparticipating in the Olympic games increased until at last not only\r\nGreeks but competitors from the closely kindred countries of Epirus and\r\nMacedonia to the north were admitted.\r\n\r\nThe Greek cities grew in trade and importance, and the quality of their\r\ncivilization rose steadily in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. \r\nTheir social life differed in many interesting points from the social\r\nlife of the Ægean and river valley civilizations. They had splendid\r\ntemples but the priesthood was not the great traditional body it was in\r\nthe cities of the older world, the-repository of all knowledge, the\r\nstorehouse of ideas.  They had leaders and noble families, but no\r\nquasi- divine monarch surrounded by an elaborately organized court.\r\nRather their organization was aristocratic, with leading families which\r\nkept each other in order.  Even their so- called “democracies” were\r\naristocratic; every citizen had a share in public affairs and came to\r\nthe assembly in a democracy, _but everybody was not a citizen_.  The\r\nGreek democracies were not like our modern “democracies” in which\r\neveryone has a vote.  Many of the Greek democracies had a few hundred\r\nor a few thousand citizens and then many thousands of slaves, freedmen\r\nand so forth, with no share in public affairs.  Generally in Greece\r\naffairs were in the hands of a community of substantial men. Their\r\nkings and their tyrants alike were just men set in front of other men\r\nor usurping a leadership; they were not quasi-divine overmen like\r\nPharaoh or Minos or the monarchs of Mesopotamia.  Both thought and\r\ngovernment therefore had a freedom under Greek conditions such as they\r\nhad known in none of the older civilizations.  The Greeks had brought\r\ndown into cities the individualism, the personal initiative of the\r\nwandering life of the northern parklands.  They were the first\r\nrepublicans of importance in history.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLE OF NEPTUNE (POSEIDON), PÆSTUM, SICILY\r\nTHE TEMPLE OF NEPTUNE (POSEIDON), PÆSTUM, SICILY\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Alinari_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd we find that as they emerge from a condition of barbaric warfare a\r\nnew thing becomes apparent in their intellectual life.  We find men who\r\nare not priests seeking and recording knowledge and enquiring into the\r\nmysteries of life and being, in a way that has hitherto been the\r\nsublime privilege of priesthood or the presumptuous amusement of kings.\r\n We find already in the sixth century B.C.—perhaps while Isaiah was\r\nstill prophesying in Babylon—such men as Thales and Anaximander of\r\nMiletus and Heraclitus of Ephesus, who were what we should now call\r\nindependent gentlemen, giving their minds to shrewd questionings of the\r\nworld in which we live, asking what its real nature was, whence it came\r\nand what its destiny might be, and refusing all ready-made or evasive\r\nanswers.  Of these questionings of the universe by the Greek mind, we\r\nshall have more to say a little later in this history.  These Greek\r\nenquirers who begin to be remarkable in the sixth century B.C. are the\r\nfirst philosophers, the first “wisdom-lovers,” in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd it may be noted here how important a century this sixth century\r\nB.C. was in the history of humanity.  For not only were these Greek\r\nphilosophers beginning the research for clear ideas about this universe\r\nand man’s place in it and Isaiah carrying Jewish prophecy to its\r\nsublimest levels, but as we shall tell later Gautama Buddha was then\r\nteaching in India and Confucius and Lao Tse in China. From Athens to\r\nthe Pacific the human mind was astir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\nTHE WARS OF THE GREEKS AND PERSIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Greeks in the cities in Greece, South Italy and Asia Minor\r\nwere embarking upon free intellectual enquiry and while in Babylon and\r\nJerusalem the last of the Hebrew prophets were creating a free\r\nconscience for mankind, two adventurous Aryan peoples, the Medes and\r\nthe Persians, were in possession of the civilization of the ancient\r\nworld and were making a great empire, the Persian empire, which was far\r\nlarger in extent than any empire the world had seen hitherto. Under\r\nCyrus, Babylon and the rich and ancient civilization of Lydia had been\r\nadded to the Persian rule; the Phœnician cities of the Levant and all\r\nthe Greek cities in Asia Minor had been made tributary, Cambyses had\r\nsubjected Egypt, and Darius I, the Mede, the third of the Persian\r\nrulers (521 B.C.), found himself monarch as it seemed of all the world.\r\nHis couriers rode with his decrees from the Dardanelles to the Indus\r\nand from Upper Egypt to Central Asia.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks in Europe, it is true, Italy, Carthage, Sicily and the\r\nSpanish Phœnician settlements, were not under the Persian Peace; but\r\nthey treated it with respect and the only people who gave any serious\r\ntrouble were the old parent hordes of Nordic people in South Russia and\r\nCentral Asia, the Scythians, who raided the northern and north-eastern\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nOf course the population of this great Persian empire was not a\r\npopulation of Persians, The Persians were only the small conquering\r\nminority of this enormous realm.  The rest of the population was what\r\nit had been before the Persians came from time immemorial, only that\r\nPersian was the administrative language.  Trade and finance were still\r\nlargely Semitic, Tyre and Sidon as of old were the great Mediterranean\r\nports and Semitic shipping plied upon the seas.  But many of these\r\nSemitic merchants and business people as they went from place to place\r\nalready found a sympathetic and convenient common history in the Hebrew\r\ntradition and the Hebrew scriptures.  A new element which was\r\nincreasing rapidly in this empire was the Greek element.  The Greeks\r\nwere becoming serious rivals to the Semites upon the sea, and their\r\ndetached and vigorous intelligence made them useful and, unprejudiced\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINE PIECE OF ATHENIAN POTTERY\r\nFINE PIECE OF ATHENIAN POTTERY\r\n\r\nShowing Greek merchant vesselswith sails and oars statue on left\r\n\r\n_Brit. Mus._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on account of the Scythians that Darius I invaded Europe.  He\r\nwanted to reach South Russia, the homeland of the Scythian horsemen. \r\nHe crossed the Bosphorus with a great army and marched through Bulgaria\r\nto the Danube, crossed this by a bridge of boats and pushed far\r\nnorthward.  His army suffered terribly.  It was largely an infantry\r\nforce and the mounted Scythians rode all round it, cut off its\r\nsupplies, destroyed any stragglers and never came to a pitched battle.\r\nDarius was forced into an inglorious retreat.\r\n\r\nHe returned himself to Susa but he left an army in Thrace and\r\nMacedonia, and Macedonia submitted to Darius.  Insurrections of the\r\nGreek cities in Asia followed this failure, and the European Greeks\r\nwere drawn into the contest.  Darius resolved upon the subjugation of\r\nthe Greeks in Europe.  With the Phœnician fleet at his disposal he was\r\nable to subdue one island after another, and finally in 490 B.C. he\r\nmade his main attack upon Athens.  A considerable Armada sailed from\r\nthe ports of Asia Minor and the eastern Mediterranean, and the\r\nexpedition landed its troops at Marathon to the north of Athens.  There\r\nthey were met and signally defeated by the Athenians.\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary thing happened at this time.  The bitterest rival of\r\nAthens in Greece was Sparta, but now Athens appealed to Sparta, sending\r\na herald, a swift runner, imploring the Spartans not to let Greeks\r\nbecome slaves to barbarians.  This runner (the prototype of all\r\n“Marathon” runners) did over a hundred miles of broken country in less\r\nthan two days.  The Spartans responded promptly and generously; but\r\nwhen, in three days, the Spartan force reached Athens, there was\r\nnothing for it to do but to view the battlefield and the bodies of the\r\ndefeated Persian soldiers.  The Persian fleet had returned to Asia.  So\r\nended the first Persian attack on Greece.\r\n\r\nThe next was much more impressive.  Darius died soon after the news of\r\nhis defeat at Marathon reached him, and for four years his son and\r\nsuccessor, Xerxes, prepared a host to crush the Greeks.  For a time\r\nterror united all the Greeks.  The army of Xerxes was certainly the\r\ngreatest that had hitherto been assembled in the world.  It was a huge\r\nassembly of discordant elements.  It crossed the Dardanelles, 480 B.C.,\r\nby a bridge of boats; and along the coast as it advanced moved an\r\nequally miscellaneous fleet carrying supplies.  At the narrow pass of\r\nThermopylæ a small force of 1400 men under the Spartan Leonidas\r\nresisted this multitude, and after a fight of unsurpassed heroism was\r\ncompletely destroyed.  Every man was killed.  But the losses they\r\ninflicted upon the Persians were enormous, and the army of Xerxes\r\npushed on to Thebes and Athens in a chastened mood. Thebes surrendered\r\nand made terms.  The Athenians abandoned their city and it was burnt.\r\n\r\nGreece seemed in the hands of the conqueror, but again came victory\r\nagainst the odds and all expectations.  The Greek fleet, though not a\r\nthird the size of the Persian, assailed it in the bay of Salamis and\r\ndestroyed it.  Xerxes found himself and his immense army cut off from\r\nsupplies and his heart failed him.  He retreated to Asia with one half\r\nof his army, leaving the rest to be defeated at Platea (479 B.C.) what\r\ntime the remnants of the Persian fleet were hunted down by the Greeks\r\nand destroyed at Mycalæ in Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n\r\nALL THAT REMAINS OF THE GREAT TEMPLE OF CORINTH\r\nALL THAT REMAINS OF THE GREAT TEMPLE OF CORINTH\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Fred Boissonnas_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Persian danger was at an end.  Most of the Greek cities in Asia\r\nbecame free.  All this is told in great detail and with much\r\npicturesqueness in the first of written histories, the _History_ of\r\nHerodotus.  This Herodotus was born about 484 B.C. in the Ionian city\r\nof Halicarnassus in Asia Minor, and he visited Babylon and Egypt in his\r\nsearch for exact particulars.  From Mycalæ onward Persia sank into a\r\nconfusion of dynastic troubles.  Xerxes was murdered in 465 B.C. and\r\nrebellions in Egypt, Syria and Media broke up the brief order of that\r\nmighty realm.  The history of Herodotus lays stress on the weakness of\r\nPersia.  This history is indeed what we should now call\r\npropaganda—propaganda for Greece to unite and conquer Persia. \r\nHerodotus makes one character, Aristagoras, go to the Spartans with a\r\nmap of the known world and say to them: “These Barbarians are not\r\nvaliant in fight.  You on the other hand have now attained the utmost\r\nskill in war .... No other nations in the world have what they possess:\r\ngold, silver, bronze, embroidered garments, beasts and slaves. _All\r\nthis you might have for yourselves, if you so desired_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLE OF NEPTUNE (POSEIDON) AT CAPE SUNIUM\r\nTHE TEMPLE OF NEPTUNE (POSEIDON) AT CAPE SUNIUM\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Fred Boissonnas_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\nTHE SPLENDOUR OF GREECE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe century and a half that followed the defeat of Persia was one of\r\nvery great splendour for the Greek civilization. True that Greece was\r\ntorn by a desperate struggle for ascendancy between Athens, Sparta and\r\nother states (the Peloponnesian War 431 to 404 B.C.) and that in 338\r\nB.C. the Macedonians became virtually masters of Greece; nevertheless\r\nduring this period the thought and the creative and artistic impulse of\r\nthe Greeks rose to levels that made their achievement a lamp to mankind\r\nfor all the rest of history.\r\n\r\nThe head and centre of this mental activity was Athens.  For over\r\nthirty years (466 to 428 B.C.) Athens was dominated by a man of great\r\nvigour and liberality of mind, Pericles, who set himself to rebuild the\r\ncity from the ashes to which the Persians had reduced it. The beautiful\r\nruins that still glorify Athens to-day are chiefly the remains of this\r\ngreat effort.  And he did not simply rebuild a material Athens.  He\r\nrebuilt Athens intellectually.  He gathered about him not only\r\narchitects and sculptors but poets, dramatists, philosophers and\r\nteachers.  Herodotus came to Athens to recite his history (438 B.C.).\r\nAnaxagoras came with the beginnings of a scientific description of the\r\nsun and stars.  Æschylus, Sophocles and Euripides one after the other\r\ncarried the Greek drama to its highest levels or beauty and nobility.\r\n\r\nThe impetus Pericles gave to the intellectual life of Athens lived on\r\nafter his death, and in spite of the fact that the peace of Greece was\r\nnow broken by the Peloponnesian War and a long and wasteful struggle\r\nfor “ascendancy” was beginning.  Indeed the darkling of the political\r\nhorizon seems for a time to have quickened rather than discouraged\r\nmen’s minds.\r\n\r\nAlready long before the time of Pericles the peculiar freedom of Greek\r\ninstitutions had given great importance to skill in discussion. \r\nDecision rested neither with king nor with priest but in the assemblies\r\nof the people or of leading men.  Eloquence and able argument became\r\nvery desirable accomplishments therefore, and a class of teachers\r\narose, the Sophists, who undertook to strengthen young men in these\r\narts.  But one cannot reason without matter, and knowledge followed in\r\nthe wake of speech.  The activities and rivalries of these Sophists led\r\nvery naturally to an acute examination of style, of methods of thought\r\nand of the validity of arguments.  When Pericles died a certain\r\nSocrates was becoming prominent as an able and destructive critic of\r\nbad argument—and much of the teaching of the Sophists was bad argument.\r\n A group of brilliant young men gathered about Socrates.  In the end\r\nSocrates was executed for disturbing people’s minds (399 B.C.), he was\r\ncondemned after the dignified fashion of the Athens of those days to\r\ndrink in his own house and among his own friends a poisonous draught\r\nmade from hemlock, but the disturbance of people’s minds went on in\r\nspite of his condemnation. His young men carried on his teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART OF THE FAMOUS FRIEZE OF THE PARTHENON, ATHENS\r\nPART OF THE FAMOUS FRIEZE OF THE PARTHENON, ATHENS\r\n\r\nA specimen of Grecian sculpture in its finest expression.

His teaching\r\nfell into two main divisions, an examination of the foundations and\r\nmethods of human thinking and an examination of political institutions.\r\nHe was the first man to write a Utopia, that is to say the plan of a\r\ncommunity different from and better than any existing community.  This\r\nshows an altogether unprecedented boldness in the human mind which had\r\nhitherto accepted social traditions and usages with scarcely a\r\nquestion.  Plato said plainly to mankind: “Most of the social and\r\npolitical ills from which you suffer are under your control, given only\r\nthe will and courage to change them.  You can live in another and a\r\nwiser fashion if you choose to think it out and work it out.  You are\r\nnot awake to your own power.”  That is a high adventurous teaching that\r\nhas still to soak in to the common intelligence of our race.  One of\r\nhis earliest works was the Republic, a dream of a communist\r\naristocracy; his last unfinished work was the Laws, a scheme of\r\nregulation for another such Utopian state.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARYATIDES OF THE ERECHTHEUM\r\nTHE CARYATIDES OF THE ERECHTHEUM\r\n\r\nThe ancient sanctuary on the Acropolis at Athens\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Fred Boissonnas_\r\n\r\nATHENE OF THE PARTHENON\r\nATHENE OF THE PARTHENON\r\n_Photo:  Alinart_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe criticism of methods of thinking and methods of government was\r\ncarried on after Plato’s death by Aristotle, who had been his pupil and\r\nwho taught in the Lyceum.  Aristotle came from the city of Stagira in\r\nMacedonia, and his father was court physician to the Macedonian king. \r\nFor a time Aristotle was tutor to Alexander, the king’s son, who was\r\ndestined to achieve very great things of which we shall soon be\r\ntelling.  Aristotle’s work upon methods of thinking carried the science\r\nof Logic to a level at which it remained for fifteen hundred years or\r\nmore, until the mediæval schoolmen took up the ancient questions again.\r\n He made no Utopias.  Before man could really control his destiny as\r\nPlato taught, Aristotle perceived that he needed far more knowledge and\r\nfar more accurate knowledge than he possessed. And so Aristotle began\r\nthat systematic collection of knowledge which nowadays we call Science.\r\n He sent out explorers to collect _facts_.  He was the father of\r\nnatural history.  He was the founder of political science. His students\r\nat the Lyceum examined and compared the constitutions of 158 different\r\nstates ....\r\n\r\nHere in the fourth century B.C. we find men who are practically “modern\r\nthinkers.” The child-like, dream-like methods of primitive thought had\r\ngiven way to a disciplined and critical attack upon the problems of\r\nlife.  The weird and monstrous symbolism and imagery of the gods and\r\ngod monsters, and all the taboos and awes and restraints that have\r\nhitherto encumbered thinking are here completely set aside.  Free,\r\nexact and systematic thinking has begun.  The fresh and unencumbered\r\nmind of these newcomers out of the northern forests has thrust itself\r\ninto the mysteries of the temple and let the daylight in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\nTHE EMPIRE OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 431 to 404 B.C. the Peloponnesian War wasted Greece. Meanwhile to\r\nthe north of Greece, the kindred country of Macedonia was rising slowly\r\nto power and civilization. The Macedonians spoke a language closely\r\nakin to Greek, and on several occasions Macedonian competitors had\r\ntaken part in the Olympic games. In 359 B.C. a man of very great\r\nabilities and ambition became king of this little country—Philip.\r\nPhilip had previously been a hostage in Greece; he had had a thoroughly\r\nGreek education and he was probably aware of the ideas of\r\nHerodotus—which had also been developed by the philosopher Isocrates—of\r\na possible conquest of Asia by a consolidated Greece.\r\n\r\nHe set himself first to extend and organize his own realm and to\r\nremodel his army.  For a thousand years now the charging horse-chariot\r\nhad been the decisive factor in battles, that and the close-fighting\r\ninfantry.  Mounted horsemen had also fought, but as a cloud of\r\nskirmishers, individually and without discipline.  Philip made his\r\ninfantry fight in a closely packed mass, the Macedonian phalanx, and he\r\ntrained his mounted gentlemen, the knights or companions, to fight in\r\nformation and so invented cavalry.  The master move in most of his\r\nbattles and in the battles of his son Alexander was a cavalry charge. \r\nThe phalanx _held_ the enemy infantry in front while the cavalry swept\r\naway the enemy horse on his wings and poured in on the flank and rear\r\nof his infantry. Chariots were disabled by bowmen, who shot the horses.\r\n\r\nWith this new army Philip extended his frontiers through Thessaly to\r\nGreece; and the battle of Chæronia (338 B.C.), fought against Athens\r\nand her allies, put all Greece at his feet.  At last the dream of\r\nHerodotus was bearing fruit.  A congress of all the Greek states\r\nappointed Philip captain-general of the Græco- Macedonian confederacy\r\nagainst Persia, and in 336 B.C. his advanced guard crossed into Asia\r\nupon this long premeditated adventure.  But he never followed it.  He\r\nwas assassinated; it is believed at the instigation of his queen\r\nOlympias, Alexander’s mother.  She was jealous because Philip had\r\nmarried a second wife.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUST OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT\r\nBUST OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT\r\n_(As in the British Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Philip had taken unusual pains with his son’s education.  He had\r\nnot only secured Aristotle, the greatest philosopher in the world, as\r\nthis boy’s tutor, but he had shared his ideas with him and thrust\r\nmilitary experience upon him.  At Chæronia Alexander, who was then only\r\neighteen years old, had been in command of the cavalry.  And so it was\r\npossible for this young man, who was still only twenty years old at the\r\ntime of his accession, to take up his father’s task at once and to\r\nproceed successfully with the Persian adventure.\r\n\r\nIn 334 B.C.—for two years were needed to establish and confirm his\r\nposition in Macedonia and Greece—he crossed into Asia, defeated a not\r\nvery much bigger Persian army at the battle of the Granicus and\r\ncaptured a number of cities in Asia Minor.  He kept along the\r\nsea-coast.  It was necessary for him to reduce and garrison all the\r\ncoast towns as he advanced because the Persians had control of the\r\nfleets of Tyre and Sidon and so had command of the sea.  Had he left a\r\nhostile port in his rear the Persians might have landed forces to raid\r\nhis communications and cut him off. At  Issus (333 B.C.) he met and\r\nsmashed a vast conglomerate host under Darius III.  Like the host of\r\nXerxes that had crossed the Dardanelles a century and a half before, it\r\nwas an incoherent accumulation of contingents and it was encumbered\r\nwith a multitude of court officials, the harem of Darius and many camp\r\nfollowers.  Sidon surrendered to Alexander but Tyre resisted\r\nobstinately.  Finally that great city was stormed and plundered and\r\ndestroyed.  Gaza also was stormed, and towards the end of 332 B.C. the\r\nconqueror entered Egypt and took over its rule from the Persians.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER’S VICTORY OVER THE PERSIANS AT ISSUS\r\nALEXANDER’S VICTORY OVER THE PERSIANS AT ISSUS\r\n_(From the Pompeian Mosaic)_\r\n\r\nAlexander charges in on the left, Darius is in the chariot to the right\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Alexandretta and at Alexandria in Egypt he built great cities,\r\naccessible from the land and so incapable of revolt. To these the trade\r\nof the Phœnician cities was diverted. The Phœnicians of the western\r\nMediterranean suddenly disappear from history—and as immediately the\r\nJews of Alexandria and the other new trading cities created by\r\nAlexander appear.\r\n\r\nIn 331 B.C. Alexander marched out of Egypt upon Babylon as Thothmes and\r\nRameses and Necho had done before him.  But he marched by way of Tyre. \r\nAt Arbela near the ruins of Nineveh, which was already a forgotten\r\ncity, he met Darius and fought the decisive battle of the war.  The\r\nPersian chariot charge failed, a Macedonian cavalry charge broke up the\r\ngreat composite host and the phalanx completed the victory.  Darius led\r\nthe retreat.  He made no further attempt to resist the invader but fled\r\nnorthward into the country of the Medes.  Alexander marched on to\r\nBabylon, still prosperous and important, and then to Susa and\r\nPersepolis.  There after a drunken festival he burnt down the palace of\r\nDarius, the king of kings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APOLLO BELVEDERE\r\nTHE APOLLO BELVEDERE\r\n\r\n_(In the Vatican Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThence Alexander presently made a military parade of central Asia,\r\ngoing to the utmost bounds of the Persian empire.  At first he turned\r\nnorthward.  Darius was pursued; and he was overtaken at dawn dying in\r\nhis chariot, having been murdered by his own people.  He was still\r\nliving when the foremost Greeks reached him.  Alexander came up to find\r\nhim dead. Alexander skirted the Caspian Sea, he went up into the\r\nmountains of western Turkestan, he came down by Herat (which he\r\nfounded) and Cabul and the Khyber Pass into India.  He fought a great\r\nbattle on the Indus with an Indian king, Porus, and here the Macedonian\r\ntroops met elephants for the first time and defeated them.  Finally he\r\nbuilt himself ships, sailed down to the mouth of the Indus, and marched\r\nback by the coast of Beluchistan, reaching Susa again in 324 B.C. after\r\nan absence of six years. He then prepared to consolidate and organize\r\nthis vast empire he had won.  He sought to win over his new subjects. \r\nHe assumed the robes and tiara of a Persian monarch, and this roused\r\nthe jealousy of his Macedonian commanders.  He had much trouble with\r\nthem.  He arranged a number of marriages between these Macedonian\r\nofficers and Persian and Babylonian women: the “Marriage of the East\r\nand West.”  He never lived to effect the consolidation he had planned. \r\nA fever seized him after a drinking bout in Babylon and he died in 323\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\nImmediately this vast dominion fell to pieces.  One of his generals,\r\nSeleucus, retained most of the old Persian empire from the Indus to\r\nEphesus; another, Ptolemy, seized Egypt, and Antigonus secured\r\nMacedonia.  The rest of the empire remained unstable, passing under the\r\ncontrol of a succession of local adventurers.  Barbarian raids began\r\nfrom the north and grew in scope and intensity.  Until at last, as we\r\nshall tell, a new power, the power of the Roman republic, came out of\r\nthe west to subjugate one fragment after another and weld them together\r\ninto a new and more enduring empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\nTHE MUSEUM AND LIBRARY AT ALEXANDRIA\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the time of Alexander Greeks had already been spreading as\r\nmerchants, artists, officials, mercenary soldiers, over most of the\r\nPersian dominions. In the dynastic disputes that followed the death of\r\nXerxes, a band of ten thousand Greek mercenaries played a part under\r\nthe leadership of Xenophon. Their return to Asiatic Greece from Babylon\r\nis described in his _Retreat of the Ten Thousand_, one of the first war\r\nstories that was ever written by a general in command. But the\r\nconquests of Alexander and the division of his brief empire among his\r\nsubordinate generals, greatly stimulated this permeation of the ancient\r\nworld by the Greeks and their language and fashions and culture. Traces\r\nof this Greek dissemination are to be found far away in central Asia\r\nand in north-west India. Their influence upon the development of Indian\r\nart was profound.\r\n\r\nFor many centuries Athens retained her prestige as a centre of art and\r\nculture; her schools went on indeed to 529 A.D., that is to say for\r\nnearly a thousand years; but the leadership in the intellectual\r\nactivity of the world passed presently across the Mediterranean to\r\nAlexandria, the new trading city that Alexander had founded. Here the\r\nMacedonian general Ptolemy had become Pharaoh, with a court that spoke\r\nGreek.  He had become an intimate of Alexander before he became king,\r\nand he was deeply saturated with the ideas of Aristotle.  He set\r\nhimself, with great energy and capacity, to organize knowledge and\r\ninvestigation. He also wrote a history of Alexander’s campaigns which,\r\nunhappily, is lost to the world.\r\n\r\nAlexander had already devoted considerable sums to finance the\r\nenquiries of Aristotle, but Ptolemy I was the first person to make a\r\npermanent endowment of science.  He set up a foundation in Alexandria\r\nwhich was formerly dedicated to the Muses, the Museum of Alexandria. \r\nFor two or three generations the scientific work done at Alexandria was\r\nextraordinarily good.  Euclid, Eratosthenes who measured the size of\r\nthe earth and came within fifty miles of its true diameter, Apollonius\r\nwho wrote on conic sections, Hipparchus who made the first star map and\r\ncatalogue, and Hero who devised the first steam engine are among the\r\ngreater stars of an extraordinary constellation of scientific pioneers.\r\nArchimedes came from Syracuse to Alexandria to study, and was a\r\nfrequent correspondent of the Museum.  Herophilus was one of the\r\ngreatest of Greek anatomists, and is said to have practised\r\nvivisection.\r\n\r\nFor a generation or so during the reigns of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II\r\nthere was such a blaze of knowledge and discovery at Alexandria as the\r\nworld was not to see again until the sixteenth century A.D.  But it did\r\nnot continue.  There may have been several causes of this decline. \r\nChief among them, the late Professor Mahaffy suggested, was the fact\r\nthat the Museum was a “royal” college and all its professors and\r\nfellows were appointed and paid by Pharaoh.  This was all very well\r\nwhen Pharaoh was Ptolemy I, the pupil and friend of Aristotle.  But as\r\nthe dynasty of the Ptolemies went on they became Egyptianized, they\r\nfell under the sway of Egyptian priests and Egyptian religious\r\ndevelopments, they ceased to follow the work that was done, and their\r\ncontrol stifled the spirit of enquiry altogether.  The Museum produced\r\nlittle good work after its first century of activity.\r\n\r\nPtolemy I not only sought in the most modern spirit to organize the\r\nfinding of fresh knowledge.  He tried also to set up an encyclopædic\r\nstorehouse of wisdom in the Library of Alexandria.  It was not simply a\r\nstorehouse, it was also a book-copying and book-selling organization. \r\nA great army of copyists was set to work perpetually multiplying copies\r\nof books.\r\n\r\nHere then we have the definite first opening up of the intellectual\r\nprocess in which we live to-day; here we have the systematic gathering\r\nand distribution of knowledge.  The foundation of this Museum and\r\nLibrary marks one of the great epochs in the history of mankind.  It is\r\nthe true beginning of Modern History.\r\n\r\n\r\nARISTOTLE\r\nARISTOTLE\r\nFrom Herculaneum, probably Fourth Century B.C.\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Dr. Singer_\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth the work of research and the work of dissemination went on under\r\nserious handicaps.  One of these was the great social gap that\r\nseparated the philosopher, who was a gentleman, from the trader and the\r\nartisan.  There were glass workers and metal workers in abundance in\r\nthose days, but they were not in mental contact with the thinkers.  The\r\nglass worker was making the most beautifully coloured beads and phials\r\nand so forth, but he never made a Florentine flask or a lens.  Clear\r\nglass does not seem to have interested him. The metal worker made\r\nweapons and jewellery but he never made a chemical balance.  The\r\nphilosopher speculated loftily about atoms and the nature of things,\r\nbut he had no practical experience of enamels and pigments and philters\r\nand so forth. He was not interested in substances.  So Alexandria in\r\nits brief day of opportunity produced no microscopes and no chemistry. \r\nAnd though Hero invented a steam engine it was never set either to pump\r\nor drive a boat or do any useful thing.  There were few practical\r\napplications of science except in the realm of medicine, and the\r\nprogress of science was not stimulated and sustained by the interest\r\nand excitement of practical applications.  There was nothing to keep\r\nthe work going therefore when the intellectual curiosity of Ptolemy I\r\nand Ptolemy II was withdrawn.  The discoveries of the Museum went on\r\nrecord in obscure manuscripts and never, until the revival of\r\nscientific curiosity at the Renascence, reached out to the mass of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nNor did the Library produce any improvements in book making. That\r\nancient world had no paper made in definite sizes from rag pulp.  Paper\r\nwas a Chinese invention and it did not reach the western world until\r\nthe ninth century A.D.  The only book materials were parchment and\r\nstrips of the papyrus reed joined edge to edge.  These strips were kept\r\non rolls which were very unwieldy to wind to and fro and read, and very\r\ninconvenient for reference.  It was these things that prevented the\r\ndevelopment of paged and printed books.  Printing itself was known in\r\nthe world it would seem as early as the Old Stone Age; there were seals\r\nin ancient Sumeria; but without abundant paper there was little\r\nadvantage in printing books, an improvement that may further have been\r\nresisted by trades unionism on the part of the copyists employed. \r\nAlexandria produced abundant books but not cheap books, and it never\r\nspread knowledge into the population of the ancient world below the\r\nlevel of a wealthy and influential class.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATUETTE OF MAITREYA: THE BUDDHA TO COME\r\nSTATUETTE OF MAITREYA: THE BUDDHA TO COME\r\nA Græco-Buddhist sculpture of the Third Century A.D.\r\n\r\n_(From Malakand, N. W. Province, now in the India Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it was that this blaze of intellectual enterprise never reached\r\nbeyond a small circle of people in touch with the group of philosophers\r\ncollected by the first two Ptolemies. It was like the light in a dark\r\nlantern which is shut off from the world at large.  Within the blaze\r\nmay be blindingly bright, but nevertheless it is unseen.  The rest of\r\nthe world went on its old ways unaware that the seed of scientific\r\nknowledge that was one day to revolutionize it altogether had been\r\nsown.  Presently a darkness of bigotry fell even upon Alexandria.\r\nThereafter for a thousand years of darkness the seed that Aristotle had\r\nsown lay hidden.  Then it stirred and began to germinate.  In a few\r\ncenturies it had become that widespread growth of knowledge and clear\r\nideas that is now changing the whole of human life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF BUDDHA\r\nTHE DEATH OF BUDDHA\r\nGræco-Buddhist carving from Sivat Valley, N. W. Province, probably A.D.\r\n350\r\n\r\n_India Mus._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexandria was not the only centre of Greek intellectual activity in\r\nthe third century B.C. There were many other cities that displayed a\r\nbrilliant intellectual life amidst the disintegrating fragments of the\r\nbrief empire of Alexander.  There was, for example, the Greek city of\r\nSyracuse in Sicily, where thought and science flourished for two\r\ncenturies; there was Pergamum in Asia Minor, which also had a great\r\nlibrary.  But this brilliant Hellenic world was now stricken by\r\ninvasion from the north. New Nordic barbarians, the Gauls, were\r\nstriking down along the tracks that had once been followed by the\r\nancestors of the Greeks and Phrygians and Macedonians.  They raided,\r\nshattered and destroyed.  And in the wake of the Gauls came a new\r\nconquering people out of Italy, the Romans, who gradually subjugated\r\nall the western half of the vast realm of Darius and Alexander.  They\r\nwere an able but unimaginative people, preferring law and profit to\r\neither science or art.  New invaders were also coming down out of\r\ncentral Asia to shatter and subdue the Seleucid empire and to cut off\r\nthe western world again from India.  These were the Parthians, hosts of\r\nmounted bowmen, who treated the Græco-Persian empire of Persepolis and\r\nSusa in the third century B.C. in much the same fashion that the Medes\r\nand Persians had treated it in the seventh and sixth.  And there were\r\nnow other nomadic peoples also coming out of the northeast, peoples who\r\nwere not fair and Nordic and Aryan- speaking but yellow-skinned and\r\nblack-haired and with a Mongolian speech.  But of these latter people\r\nwe shall tell more in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\nTHE LIFE OF GAUTAMA BUDDHA\r\n\r\n\r\nBut now we must go back three centuries in our story to tell of a great\r\nteacher who came near to revolutionizing the religious thought and\r\nfeeling of all Asia. This was Gautama Buddha, who taught his disciples\r\nat Benares in India about the same time that Isaiah was prophesying\r\namong the Jews in Babylon and Heraclitus was carrying on his\r\nspeculative enquiries into the nature of things at Ephesus. All these\r\nmen were in the world at the same time, in the sixth century\r\nB.C.—unaware of one another.\r\n\r\nThis sixth century B.C. was indeed one of the most remarkable in all\r\nhistory. Everywhere—for as we shall tell it was also the case in\r\nChina—men’s minds were displaying a new boldness. Everywhere they were\r\nwaking up out of the traditions of kingships and priests and blood\r\nsacrifices and asking the most penetrating questions.  It is as if the\r\nrace had reached a stage of adolescence—after a childhood of twenty\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\nThe early history of India is still very obscure.  Somewhen perhaps\r\nabout 2000 B.C., an Aryan- speaking people came down from the\r\nnorth-west into India either in one invasion or in a series of\r\ninvasions; and was able to spread its language and traditions over most\r\nof north India.  Its peculiar variety of Aryan speech was the Sanskrit.\r\n They found a brunette people with a more elaborate civilization and\r\nless vigour of will, in possession of the country of the Indus and\r\nGanges.  But they do not seem to have mingled with their predecessors\r\nas freely as did the Greeks and Persians.  They remained aloof.  When\r\nthe past of India becomes dimly visible to the historian, Indian\r\nsociety is already stratified into several layers, with a variable\r\nnumber of sub-divisions, which do not eat together nor intermarry nor\r\nassociate freely.  And throughout history this stratification into\r\ncastes continues.  This makes the Indian population something different\r\nfrom the simple, freely inter-breeding European or Mongolian\r\ncommunities.  It is really a community of communities.\r\n\r\nSiddhattha Gautama was the son of an aristocratic family which ruled a\r\nsmall district on the Himalayan slopes.  He was married at nineteen to\r\na beautiful cousin.  He hunted and played and went about in his sunny\r\nworld of gardens and groves and irrigated rice-fields.  And it was\r\namidst this life that a great discontent fell upon him.  It was the\r\nunhappiness of a fine brain that seeks employment.  He felt that the\r\nexistence he was leading was not the reality of life, but a holiday—a\r\nholiday that had gone on too long.\r\n\r\nThe sense of disease and mortality, the insecurity and the\r\nun-satisfactoriness of all happiness, descended upon the mind of\r\nGautama.  While he was in this mood he met one of those wandering\r\nascetics who already existed in great numbers in India.  These men\r\nlived under severe rules, spending much time in meditation and in\r\nreligious discussion.  They were supposed to be seeking some deeper\r\nreality in life, and a passionate desire to do likewise took possession\r\nof Gautama.\r\n\r\nHe was meditating upon this project, says the story, when the news was\r\nbrought to him that his wife had been delivered of his first-born son.\r\n“This is another tie to break,” said Gautama.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the village amidst the rejoicings of his fellow\r\nclansmen.  There was a great feast and a Nautch dance to celebrate the\r\nbirth of this new tie, and in the night Gautama awoke in a great agony\r\nof spirit, “like a man who is told that his house is on fire.”  He\r\nresolved to leave his happy aimless life forthwith.  He went softly to\r\nthe threshold of his wife’s chamber, and saw her by the light of a\r\nlittle oil lamp, sleeping sweetly, surrounded by flowers, with his\r\ninfant son in her arms.  He felt a great craving to take up the child\r\nin one first and last embrace before he departed, but the fear of\r\nwaking his wife prevented him, and at last he turned away and went out\r\ninto the bright Indian moonshine and mounted his horse and rode off\r\ninto the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIBETAN BUDDHA\r\nTIBETAN BUDDHA\r\nGilt Brass Casting in India Museum, showing Gautama Buddha in the\r\n“earth witness” attitude\r\n\r\n_India Mus._\r\n\r\n\r\nVery far he rode that night, and in the morning he stopped outside the\r\nlands of his clan, and dismounted beside a sandy river.  There he cut\r\noff his flowing locks with his sword, removed all his ornaments and\r\nsent them and his horse and sword back to his house.  Going on he\r\npresently met a ragged man and exchanged clothes with him, and so\r\nhaving divested himself of all worldly entanglements he was free to\r\npursue his search after wisdom. He made his way southward to a resort\r\nof hermits and teachers in a hilly spur of the Vindhya Mountains. \r\nThere lived a number of wise men in a warren of caves, going into the\r\ntown for their simple supplies and imparting their knowledge by word of\r\nmouth to such as cared to come to them.  Gautama became versed in all\r\nthe metaphysics of his age.  But his acute intelligence was\r\ndissatisfied with the solutions offered him.\r\n\r\n\r\nA BURMESE BUDDHA\r\nA BURMESE BUDDHA\r\nMarble Figure from Mandalay, eighteenth century work, now in the India\r\nMuseum\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indian mind has always been disposed to believe that power and\r\nknowledge may be obtained by extreme asceticism, by fasting,\r\nsleeplessness, and self-torment, and these ideas Gautama now put to the\r\ntest.  He betook himself with five disciple companions to the jungle\r\nand there he gave himself up to fasting and terrible penances.  His\r\nfame spread, “like the sound of a great bell hung in the canopy of the\r\nskies.”  But it brought him no sense of truth achieved. One day he was\r\nwalking up and down, trying to think in spite of his enfeebled state. \r\nSuddenly he fell unconscious.  When he recovered, the preposterousness\r\nof these semi-magical ways to wisdom was plain to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DHAMÊKH TOWER\r\nTHE DHAMÊKH TOWER\r\nIn the Deer Park at Sarnath.  Sixth Century A.D.\r\n\r\n_(From a Painting in the India Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nHe horrified his companions by demanding ordinary food and refusing to\r\ncontinue his mortifications.  He had realized that whatever truth a man\r\nmay reach is reached best by a nourished brain in a healthy body.  Such\r\na conception was absolutely foreign to the ideas of the land and age. \r\nHis disciples deserted him, and went off in a melancholy state to\r\nBenares.  Gautama wandered alone.\r\n\r\nWhen the mind grapples with a great and intricate problem, it makes its\r\nadvances step by step, with but little realization of the gains it has\r\nmade, until suddenly, with an effect of abrupt illumination, it\r\nrealizes its victory.  So it happened to Gautama.  He had seated\r\nhimself under a great tree by the side of a river to eat, when this\r\nsense of clear vision came to him.  It seemed to him that he saw life\r\nplain.  He is said to have sat all day and all night in profound\r\nthought, and then he rose up to impart his vision to the world.\r\n\r\nHe went on to Benares and there he sought out and won back his lost\r\ndisciples to his new teaching.  In the King’s Deer Park at Benares they\r\nbuilt themselves huts and set up a sort of school to which came many\r\nwho were seeking after wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe starting point of his teaching was his own question as a fortunate\r\nyoung man, “Why am I not completely happy?”  It was an introspective\r\nquestion. It was a question very different in quality from the frank\r\nand self-forgetful _externalized_ curiosity with which Thales and\r\nHeraclitus were attacking the problems of the universe, or the equally\r\nself-forgetful burthen of moral obligation that the culminating\r\nprophets were imposing upon the Hebrew mind.  The Indian teacher did\r\nnot forget self, he concentrated upon self and sought to destroy it. \r\nAll suffering, he taught, was due to the greedy desires of the\r\nindividual.  Until man has conquered his personal cravings his life is\r\ntrouble and his end sorrow.  There were three principal forms that the\r\ncraving for life took and they were all evil.  The first was the desire\r\nof the appetites, greed and all forms of sensuousness, the second was\r\nthe desire for a personal and egotistic immortality, the third was the\r\ncraving for personal success, worldliness, avarice and the like.  All\r\nthese forms of desire had to be overcome to escape from the distresses\r\nand chagrins of life.  When they were overcome, when self had vanished\r\naltogether, then serenity of soul, Nirvana, the highest good was\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nThis was the gist of his teaching, a very subtle and metaphysical\r\nteaching indeed, not nearly so easy to understand as the Greek\r\ninjunction to see and know fearlessly and rightly and the Hebrew\r\ncommand to fear God and accomplish righteousness.  It was a teaching\r\nmuch beyond the understanding of even Gautama’s immediate disciples,\r\nand it is no wonder that so soon as his personal influence was\r\nwithdrawn it became corrupted and coarsened.  There was a widespread\r\nbelief in India at that time that at long intervals Wisdom came to\r\nearth and was incarnate in some chosen person who was known as the\r\nBuddha.  Gautama’s disciples declared that he was a Buddha, the latest\r\nof the Buddhas, though there is no evidence that he himself ever\r\naccepted the title.  Before he was well dead, a cycle of fantastic\r\nlegends began to be woven about him.  The human heart has always\r\npreferred a wonder story to a moral effort, and Gautama Buddha became\r\nvery wonderful.\r\n\r\nYet there remained a substantial gain in the world.  If Nirvana was too\r\nhigh and subtle for most men’s imaginations, if the myth-making impulse\r\nin the race was too strong for the simple facts of Gautama’s life, they\r\ncould at least grasp something of the intention of what Gautama called\r\nthe Eight-fold way, the Aryan or Noble Path in life.  In this there was\r\nan insistence upon mental uprightness, upon right aims and speech,\r\nright conduct and honest livelihood.  There was a quickening of the\r\nconscience and an appeal to generous and self-forgetful ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\nKING ASOKA\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some generations after the death of Gautama, these high and noble\r\nBuddhist teachings, this first plain teaching that the highest good for\r\nman is the subjugation of self, made comparatively little headway in\r\nthe world. Then they conquered the imagination of one of the greatest\r\nmonarchs the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned how Alexander the Great came down into India\r\nand fought with Porus upon the Indus.  It is related by the Greek\r\nhistorians that a certain Chandragupta Maurya came into Alexander’s\r\ncamp and tried to persuade him to go on to the Ganges and conquer all\r\nIndia. Alexander could not do this because of the refusal of his\r\nMacedonians to go further into what was for them an unknown world, and\r\nlater on (303 B.C.) Chandragupta was able to secure the help or various\r\nhill tribes and realize his dream without Greek help. He built up an\r\nempire in North India and was presently (303 B.C.) able to attack\r\nSeleucus I in the Punjab and drive the last vestige of Greek power out\r\nof India. His son extended this new empire. His grandson, Asoka, the\r\nmonarch of whom we now have to tell, found himself in 264 B.C. ruling\r\nfrom Afghanistan to Madras.\r\n\r\nAsoka was at first disposed to follow the example of his father and\r\ngrandfather and complete the conquest of the Indian peninsula.  He\r\ninvaded Kalinga (255 B.C.), a country on the east coast of Madras, he\r\nwas successful in his military operations and—alone among conquerors—he\r\nwas so disgusted by the cruelty and horror of war that he renounced it.\r\n He would have no more of it.  He adopted the peaceful doctrines of\r\nBuddhism and declared that henceforth his conquests should be the\r\nconquests of religion.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LOHAN OR BUDDHIST APOSTLE (Tang Dynasty)\r\nA LOHAN OR BUDDHIST APOSTLE (Tang Dynasty)\r\n\r\n_(From the statue in the British Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nHis reign for eight-and-twenty years was one of the brightest\r\ninterludes in the troubled history of mankind.  He organized a great\r\ndigging of wells in India and the planting of trees for shade.  He\r\nfounded hospitals and public gardens and gardens for the growing of\r\nmedicinal herbs.  He created a ministry for the care of the aborigines\r\nand subject races of India. He made provision for the education of\r\nwomen.  He made vast benefactions to the Buddhist teaching orders, and\r\ntried to stimulate them to a better and more energetic criticism of\r\ntheir own accumulated literature.  For corruptions and superstitious\r\naccretions had accumulated very speedily upon the pure and simple\r\nteaching of the great Indian master. Missionaries went from Asoka to\r\nKashmir, to Persia, to Ceylon and Alexandria.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSOME SHOWING THE COURT OF ASOKA\r\nTRANSOME SHOWING THE COURT OF ASOKA\r\n\r\n_India Mus._\r\n\r\nASOKA PANEL FROM BHARHUT\r\nASOKA PANEL FROM BHARHUT\r\n\r\n_India Mus._\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was Asoka, greatest of kings.  He was far in advance of his age. \r\nHe left no prince and no organization of men to carry on his work, and\r\nwithin a century of his death the great days of his reign had become a\r\nglorious memory in a shattered and decaying India.  The priestly caste\r\nof the Brahmins, the highest and most privileged caste in the Indian\r\nsocial body, has always been opposed to the frank and open teaching of\r\nBuddha.  Gradually they undermined the Buddhist influence in the land. \r\nThe old monstrous gods, the innumerable cults of Hinduism, resumed\r\ntheir sway.  Caste became more rigorous and complicated. For long\r\ncenturies Buddhism and Brahminism flourished side by side, and then\r\nslowly Buddhism decayed and Brahminism in a multitude of forms replaced\r\nit.  But beyond the confines of India and the realms of caste Buddhism\r\nspread—until it had won China and Siam and Burma and Japan, countries\r\nin which it is predominant to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PILLAR OF LIONS\r\nTHE PILLAR OF LIONS\r\nCapital of the Pillar (column lying on side) erected in Deer Park in\r\nthe time of Asoka, where Buddha preached his first sermon\r\n\r\n_(From a print in the India Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\nCONFUCIUS AND LAO TSE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have still to tell of two other great men, Confucius and Lao Tse,\r\nwho lived in that wonderful century which began the adolescence of\r\nmankind, the sixth century B.C. In this history thus far we have told\r\nvery little of the early story of China. At present that early history\r\nis still very obscure, and we look to Chinese explorers and\r\narchæolologists in the new China that is now arising to work out their\r\npast as thoroughly as the European past has been worked out during the\r\nlast century. Very long ago the first primitive Chinese civilizations\r\narose in the great river valleys out of the primordial heliolithic\r\nculture. They had, like Egypt and Sumeria, the general characteristics\r\nof that culture, and they centred upon temples in which priests and\r\npriest kings offered the seasonal blood sacrifices. The life in those\r\ncities must have been very like the Egyptian and Sumerian life of six\r\nor seven thousand years ago and very like the Maya life of Central\r\nAmerica a thousand years ago.\r\n\r\nIf there were human sacrifices they had long given way to animal\r\nsacrifices before the dawn of history.  And a form of picture writing\r\nwas growing up long before a thousand years B.C.\r\n\r\nAnd just as the primitive civilizations of Europe and western Asia were\r\nin conflict with the nomads of the desert and the nomads of the north,\r\nso the primitive Chinese civilizations had a great cloud of nomadic\r\npeoples on their northern borders.  There was a number of tribes akin\r\nin language and ways of living, who are spoken of in history in\r\nsuccession as the Huns, the Mongols, the Turks and Tartars.  They\r\nchanged and divided and combined and re-combined, just as the Nordic\r\npeoples in north Europe and central Asia changed and varied in name\r\nrather than in nature.  These Mongolian nomads had horses earlier than\r\nthe Nordic peoples, and it may be that in the region of the Altai\r\nMountains they made an independent discovery of iron somewhen after\r\n1000 B.C. And just as in the western case so ever and again these\r\neastern nomads would achieve a sort of political unity, and become the\r\nconquerors and masters and revivers of this or that settled and\r\ncivilized region.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that the earliest civilization of China was not\r\nMongolian at all any more than the earliest civilization of Europe and\r\nwestern Asia was Nordic or Semitic.  It is quite possible that the\r\nearliest civilization of China was a brunette civilization and of a\r\npiece with the earliest Egyptian, Sumerian and Dravidian civilizations,\r\nand that when the first recorded history of China began there had\r\nalready been conquests and intermixture.  At any rate we find that by\r\n1750 B.C. China was already a vast system of little kingdoms and city\r\nstates, all acknowledging a loose allegiance and paying more or less\r\nregularly, more or less definite feudal dues to one great priest\r\nemperor, the “Son of Heaven.”  The “Shang” dynasty came to an end in\r\n1125 B.C.  A “Chow” dynasty succeeded “Shang,” and maintained China in\r\na relaxing unity until the days of Asoka in India and of the Ptolemies\r\nin Egypt.  Gradually China went to pieces during that long “Chow”\r\nperiod.  Hunnish peoples came down and set up principalities; local\r\nrulers discontinued their tribute and became independent.  There was in\r\nthe sixth century B.C., says one Chinese authority, five or six\r\nthousand practically independent states in China.  It was what the\r\nChinese call in their records an “Age of Confusion.”\r\n\r\nBut this Age of Confusion was compatible with much intellectual\r\nactivity and with the existence of many local centres of art and\r\ncivilized living.  When we know more of Chinese history we shall find\r\nthat China also had her Miletus and her Athens, her Pergamum and her\r\nMacedonia.  At present we must be vague and brief about this period of\r\nChinese division simply because our knowledge is not sufficient for us\r\nto frame a coherent and consecutive story.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFUCIUS\r\nCONFUCIUS\r\nCopy of stone carving in the Temple of Confucius at K’iu Fu\r\n\r\n_(From the records of the Archæological Mission to North China\r\n(Chavannes))_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd just as in divided Greece there were philosophers and in shattered\r\nand captive Jewry prophets, so in disordered China there were\r\nphilosophers and teachers at this time.  In all these cases insecurity\r\nand uncertainty seemed to have quickened the better sort of mind. \r\nConfucius was a man of aristocratic origin and some official importance\r\nin a small state called Lu.  Here in a very parallel mood to the Greek\r\nimpulse he set up a sort of Academy for discovering and teaching\r\nWisdom.  The lawlessness and disorder of China distressed him\r\nprofoundly.  He conceived an ideal of a better government and a better\r\nlife, and travelled from state to state seeking a prince who would\r\ncarry out his legislative and educational ideas.  He never found his\r\nprince; he found a prince, but court intrigues undermined the influence\r\nof the teacher and finally defeated his reforming proposals.  It is\r\ninteresting to note that a century and a half later the Greek\r\nphilosopher Plato also sought a prince, and was for a time adviser to\r\nthe tyrant Dionysius who ruled Syracuse in Sicily.\r\n\r\nConfucius died a disappointed man.  “No intelligent ruler arises to\r\ntake me as his master,” he said, “and my time has come to die.”  But\r\nhis teaching had more vitality than he imagined in his declining and\r\nhopeless years, and it became a great formative influence with the\r\nChinese people.  It became one of what the Chinese call the Three\r\nTeachings, the other two being those of Buddha and of Lao Tse.\r\n\r\nThe gist of the teaching of Confucius was the way of the noble or\r\naristocratic man.  He was concerned with personal conduct as much as\r\nGautama was concerned with the peace of self-forgetfulness and the\r\nGreek with external knowledge and the Jew with righteousness.  He was\r\nthe most public-minded of all great teachers.  He was supremely\r\nconcerned by the confusion and miseries of the world, and he wanted to\r\nmake men noble in order to bring about a noble world.  He sought to\r\nregulate conduct to an extraordinary extent; to provide sound rules for\r\nevery occasion in life.  A polite, public- spirited gentleman, rather\r\nsternly self-disciplined, was the ideal he found already developing in\r\nthe northern Chinese world and one to which he gave a permanent form.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT WALL OF CHINA\r\nTHE GREAT WALL OF CHINA\r\nAs it crosses the mountains in Manchuria\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Underwood & Underwood_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teaching of Lao Tse, who was for a long time in charge of the\r\nimperial library of the Chow dynasty, was much more mystical and vague\r\nand elusive than that of Confucius.  He seems to have preached a\r\nstoical indifference to the pleasures and powers of the world and a\r\nreturn to an imaginary simple life of the past.  He left writings very\r\ncontracted in style and very obscure.  He wrote in riddles.  After his\r\ndeath his teachings, like the teachings of Gautama Buddha, were\r\ncorrupted and overlaid by legends and had the most complex and\r\nextraordinary observances and superstitious ideas grafted upon them. \r\nIn China just as in India primordial ideas of magic and monstrous\r\nlegends out of the childish past of our race struggled against the new\r\nthinking in the world and succeeded in plastering it over with\r\ngrotesque, irrational and antiquated observances.  Both Buddhism and\r\nTaoism (which ascribes itself largely to Lao Tse) as one finds them in\r\nChina now, are religions of monk, temple, priest and offering of a type\r\nas ancient in form, if not in thought, as the sacrificial religions of\r\nancient Sumeria and Egypt.  But the teaching of Confucius was not so\r\noverlaid because it was limited and plain and straightforward and lent\r\nitself to no such distortions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY CHINESE BRONZE BELL\r\nEARLY CHINESE BRONZE BELL\r\nInscribed in archaic characters: “made for use by the elder of Hing\r\nvillage in Ting district;” latter half of the Chou Dynasty, Sixth\r\nCentury B.C.\r\n\r\n_(In the Victoria and Albert Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth China, the China of the Hwang-ho River, became Confucian in\r\nthought and spirit; south China, Yang-tse-Kiang China, became Taoist. \r\nSince those days a conflict has always been traceable in Chinese\r\naffairs between these two spirits, the spirit of the north and the\r\nspirit of the south, between (in latter times) Pekin and Nankin,\r\nbetween the official- minded, upright and conservative north, and the\r\nsceptical, artistic, lax and experimental south.\r\n\r\nThe divisions of China of the Age of Confusion reached their worst\r\nstage in the sixth century B.C. The Chow dynasty was so enfeebled and\r\nso discredited that Lao Tse left the unhappy court and retired into\r\nprivate life.\r\n\r\nThree nominally subordinate powers dominated the situation in those\r\ndays, Ts’i and Ts’in, both northern powers, and Ch’u, which was an\r\naggressive military power in the Yangtse valley.  At last Ts’i and\r\nTs’in formed an alliance, subdued Ch’u and imposed a general treaty of\r\ndisarmament and peace in China.  The power of Ts’in became predominant.\r\n Finally about the time of Asoka in India the Ts’in monarch seized upon\r\nthe sacrificial vessels of the Chow emperor and took over his\r\nsacrificial duties. His son, Shi-Hwang-ti (king in 246 B.C., emperor in\r\n220 B.C.), is called in the Chinese Chronicles “the First Universal\r\nEmperor.”\r\n\r\nMore fortunate than Alexander, Shi-Hwang-ti reigned for thirty-six\r\nyears as king and emperor.  His energetic reign marks the beginning of\r\na new era of unity and prosperity for the Chinese people.  He fought\r\nvigorously against the Hunnish invaders from the northern deserts, and\r\nhe began that immense work, the Great Wall of China, to set a limit to\r\ntheir incursions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\nROME COMES INTO HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader will note a general similarity in the history of all these\r\ncivilizations in spite of the effectual separation caused by the great\r\nbarriers of the Indian north-west frontier and of the mountain masses\r\nof Central Asia and further India. First for thousands of years the\r\nheliolithic culture spread over all the warm and fertile river valleys\r\nof the old world and developed a temple system and priest rulers about\r\nits sacrificial traditions. Apparently its first makers were always\r\nthose brunette peoples we have spoken of as the central race of\r\nmankind. Then the nomads came in from the regions of seasonal grass and\r\nseasonal migrations and superposed their own characteristics and often\r\ntheir own language on the primitive civilization. They subjugated and\r\nstimulated it, and were stimulated to fresh developments and made it\r\nhere one thing and here another. In Mesopotamia it was the Elamite and\r\nthen the Semite, and at last the Nordic Medes and Persians and the\r\nGreeks who supplied the ferment; over the region of the Ægean peoples\r\nit was the Greeks; in India it was the Aryan-speakers; in Egypt there\r\nwas a thinner infusion of conquerors into a more intensely saturated\r\npriestly civilization; in China, the Hun conquered and was absorbed and\r\nwas followed by fresh Huns. China was Mongolized just as Greece and\r\nNorth India were Aryanized and Mesopotamia Semitized and Aryanized.\r\nEverywhere the nomads destroyed much, but everywhere they brought in a\r\nnew spirit of free enquiry and moral innovation. They questioned the\r\nbeliefs of immemorial ages. They let daylight into the temples. They\r\nset up kings who were neither priests nor gods but mere leaders among\r\ntheir captains and companions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DYING GAUL\r\nTHE DYING GAUL\r\nThe statue in the National Museum, Rome, depicting a Gaul stabbing\r\nhimself, after killing his wife, in the presence of his enemies\r\n\r\n_Photo: Anderson_\r\n\r\nIn the centuries following the sixth century B.C. we find everywhere a\r\ngreat breaking down of ancient traditions and a new spirit of moral and\r\nintellectual enquiry awake, a spirit never more to be altogether\r\nstilled in the great progressive movement of mankind.  We find reading\r\nand writing becoming common and accessible accomplishments among the\r\nruling and prosperous minority; they were no longer the jealously\r\nguarded secret of the priests.  Travel is increasing and transport\r\ngrowing easier by reason of horses and roads.  A new and easy device to\r\nfacilitate trade has been found in coined money.\r\n\r\nLet us now transfer our attention back from China in the extreme east\r\nof the old world to the western half of the Mediterranean.  Here we\r\nhave to note the appearance of a city which was destined to play at\r\nlast a very great part indeed in human affairs, Rome.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have told very little about Italy in our story. It was\r\nbefore 1000 B.C. a land of mountain and forest and thinly populated. \r\nAryan-speaking tribes had pressed down this peninsula and formed little\r\ntowns and cities, and the southern extremity was studded with Greek\r\nsettlements.  The noble ruins of Pæstum preserve for us to this day\r\nsomething of the dignity and splendour of these early Greek\r\nestablishments.  A non-Aryan people, probably akin to the Ægean\r\npeoples, the Etruscans, had established themselves in the central part\r\nof the peninsula. They had reversed the usual process by subjugating\r\nvarious Aryan tribes.  Rome, when it comes into the light of history,\r\nis a little trading city at a ford on the Tiber, with a Latin-speaking\r\npopulation ruled over by Etruscan kings.  The old chronologies gave 753\r\nB.C. as the date of the founding of Rome, half a century later than the\r\nfounding of the great Phœnician city of Carthage and twenty-three years\r\nafter the first Olympiad.  Etruscan tombs of a much earlier date than\r\n753 B.C. have, however, been excavated in the Roman Forum.\r\n\r\nIn that red-letter century, the sixth century B.C., the Etruscan kings\r\nwere expelled (510 B.C.) and Rome became an aristocratic republic with\r\na lordly class of “patrician” families dominating a commonalty of\r\n“plebeians.” Except that it spoke Latin it was not unlike many\r\naristocratic Greek republics.\r\n\r\nFor some centuries the internal history of Rome was the story of a long\r\nand obstinate struggle for freedom and a share in the government on the\r\npart of the plebeians.  It would not be difficult to find Greek\r\nparallels to this conflict, which the Greeks would have called a\r\nconflict of aristocracy with democracy.  In the end the plebeians broke\r\ndown most of the exclusive barriers of the old families and established\r\na working equality with them.  They destroyed the old exclusiveness,\r\nand made it possible and acceptable for Rome to extend her citizenship\r\nby the inclusion of more and more “outsiders.”  For while she still\r\nstruggled at home, she was extending her power abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMAINS OF THE ANCIENT ROMAN CISTERNS AT CARTHAGE\r\nREMAINS OF THE ANCIENT ROMAN CISTERNS AT CARTHAGE\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Underwood & Underwood_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extension of Roman power began in the fifth century B.C.  Until\r\nthat time they had waged war, and generally unsuccessful war, with the\r\nEtruscans.  There was an Etruscan fort, Veii, only a few miles from\r\nRome which the Romans had never been able to capture.  In 474 B.C.,\r\nhowever, a great misfortune came to the Etruscans.  Their fleet was\r\ndestroyed by the Greeks of Syracuse in Sicily.  At the same time a wave\r\nof Nordic invaders came down upon them from the north, the Gauls.\r\nCaught between Roman and Gaul, the Etruscans fell—and disappear from\r\nhistory.  Veii was captured by the Romans, The Gauls came through to\r\nRome and sacked the city (390 B.C.A.D.) but could not capture the\r\nCapitol. An attempted night surprise was betrayed by the cackling of\r\nsome geese, and finally the invaders were bought off and retired to the\r\nnorth of Italy again.\r\n\r\nThe Gaulish raid seems to have invigorated rather than weakened Rome. \r\nThe Romans conquered and assimilated the Etruscans, and extended their\r\npower over all central Italy from the Arno to Naples.  To this they had\r\nreached within a few years of 300 B.C.  Their conquests in Italy were\r\ngoing on simultaneously with the growth of Philip’s power in Macedonia\r\nand Greece, and the tremendous raid of Alexander to Egypt and the\r\nIndus.  The Romans had become notable people in the civilized world to\r\nthe east of them by the break-up of Alexander’s empire.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the Roman power were the Gauls; to the south of them\r\nwere the Greek settlements of Magna Græcia, that is to say of Sicily\r\nand of the toe and heel of Italy.  The Gauls were a hardy, warlike\r\npeople and the Romans held that boundary by a line of forts and\r\nfortified settlements.  The Greek cities in the south headed by\r\nTarentum (now Taranto) and by Syracuse in Sicily, did not so much\r\nthreaten as fear the Romans.  They looked about for some help against\r\nthese new conquerors.\r\n\r\nWe have already told how the empire of Alexander fell to pieces and was\r\ndivided among his generals and companions. Among these adventurers was\r\na kinsman of Alexander’s named Pyrrhus, who established himself in\r\nEpirus, which is across the Adriatic Sea over against the heel of\r\nItaly.  It was his ambition to play the part of Philip of Macedonia to\r\nMagna Græcia, and to become protector and master-general of Tarentum,\r\nSyracuse and the rest of that part of the world. He had what was then\r\nit very efficient modern army; he had an infantry phalanx, cavalry from\r\nThessaly—which was now quite as good as the original Macedonian\r\ncavalry—and twenty fighting elephants; he invaded Italy and routed the\r\nRomans in two considerable battles, Heraclea (280 B.C.) and Ausculum\r\n(279 B.C.), and having driven them north, he turned his attention to\r\nthe subjugation of Sicily.\r\n\r\nBut this brought against him a more formidable enemy than were the\r\nRomans at that time, the Phœnician trading city of Carthage, which was\r\nprobably then the greatest city in the world.  Sicily was too near\r\nCarthage for a new Alexander to be welcome there, and Carthage was\r\nmindful of the fate that had befallen her mother city Tyre half a\r\ncentury before.  So she sent a fleet to encourage or compel Rome to\r\ncontinue the struggle, and she cut the overseas communications of\r\nPyrrhus. Pyrrhus found himself freshly assailed by the Romans, and\r\nsuffered a disastrous repulse in an attack he had made upon their camp\r\nat Beneventum between Naples and Rome.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly came news that recalled him to Epirus.  The Gauls were\r\nraiding south.  But this time they were not raiding down into Italy;\r\nthe Roman frontier, fortified and guarded, had become too formidable\r\nfor them.  They were raiding down through Illyria (which is now Serbia\r\nand Albania) to Macedonia and Epirus.  Repulsed by the Romans,\r\nendangered at sea by the Carthaginians, and threatened at home by the\r\nGauls, Pyrrhus abandoned his dream of conquest and went home (275\r\nB.C.), and the power of Rome was extended to the Straits of Messina.\r\n\r\nOn the Sicilian side of the Straits was the Greek city of Messina, and\r\nthis presently fell into the hands of a gang of pirates.  The\r\nCarthaginians, who were already practically overlords of Sicily and\r\nallies of Syracuse, suppressed these pirates (270 B.C.) and put in a\r\nCarthaginian garrison there.  The pirates appealed to Rome and Rome\r\nlistened to their complaint.  And so across the Straits of Messina the\r\ngreat trading power of Carthage and this new conquering people, the\r\nRomans, found themselves in antagonism, face to face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\nROME AND CARTHAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in 264 B.C. that the great struggle between Rome and Carthage,\r\nthe Punic Wars, began. In that year Asoka was beginning his reign in\r\nBehar and Shi- Hwang-ti was a little child, the Museum in Alexandria\r\nwas still doing good scientific work, and the barbaric Gauls were now\r\nin Asia Minor and exacting a tribute from Pergamum. The different\r\nregions of the world were still separated by insurmountable distances,\r\nand probably the rest of mankind heard only vague and remote rumours of\r\nthe mortal fight that went on for a century and a half in Spain, Italy,\r\nNorth Africa and the western Mediterranean, between the last stronghold\r\nof Semitic power and Rome, this newcomer among Aryan-speaking peoples.\r\n\r\nThat war has left its traces upon issues that still stir the world. \r\nRome triumphed over Carthage, but the rivalry of Aryan and Semite was\r\nto merge itself later on in the conflict of Gentile and Jew.  Our\r\nhistory now is coming to events whose consequences and distorted\r\ntraditions still maintain a lingering and expiring vitality in, and\r\nexercise a complicating and confusing influence upon, the conflicts and\r\ncontroversies of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe First Punic War began in 264 B.C. about the pirates of Messina.  It\r\ndeveloped into a struggle for the possession of all Sicily except the\r\ndominions of the Greek king of Syracuse.  The advantage of the sea was\r\nat first with the Carthaginians.  They had great fighting ships of what\r\nwas hitherto an unheard-of size, quinqueremes, galleys with five banks\r\nof oars and a huge ram.  At the battle of Salamis, two centuries\r\nbefore, the leading battleships had only been triremes with three\r\nbanks.  But the Romans, with extraordinary energy and in spite of the\r\nfact that they had little naval experience, set themselves to outbuild\r\nthe Carthaginians.  They manned the new navy they created chiefly with\r\nGreek seamen, and they invented grappling and boarding to make up for\r\nthe superior seamanship of the enemy. When the Carthaginian came up to\r\nram or shear the oars of the Roman, huge grappling irons seized him and\r\nthe Roman soldiers swarmed aboard him.  At Mylæ (260 B.C.) and at\r\nEcnomus (256 B.C.) the Carthaginians were disastrously beaten. They\r\nrepulsed a Roman landing near Carthage but were badly beaten at\r\nPalermo, losing one hundred and four elephants there—to grace such a\r\ntriumphal procession through the Forum as Rome had never seen before. \r\nBut after that came two Roman defeats and then a Roman recovery.  The\r\nlast naval forces of Carthage were defeated by it last Roman effort at\r\nthe battle of the Ægatian Isles (241 B.C.) and Carthage sued for peace.\r\n All Sicily except the dominions of Hiero, king of Syracuse, was ceded\r\nto the Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANNIBAL\r\nHANNIBAL\r\n\r\nBust in the National Museum at Naples\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Mansell_\r\n\r\n\r\nFor twenty-two years Rome and Carthage kept the peace.  Both had\r\ntrouble enough at home.  In Italy the Gauls came south again,\r\nthreatened Rome—_which in a state of panic offered human sacrifices to\r\nthe Gods!_—and were routed at Telamon.  Rome pushed forward to the\r\nAlps, and even extended her dominions down the Adriatic coast to\r\nIllyria. Carthage suffered from domestic insurrections and from revolts\r\nin Corsica and Sardinia, and displayed far less recuperative power. \r\nFinally, an act of intolerable aggression, Rome seized and annexed the\r\ntwo revolting islands.\r\n\r\nSpain at that time was Carthaginian as far north as the river Ebro.  To\r\nthat boundary the Romans restricted them.  Any crossing of the Ebro by\r\nthe Carthaginians was to be considered an act of war against the\r\nRomans.  At last in 218 B.C. the Carthaginians, provoked by new Roman\r\naggressions, did cross this river under a young general named Hannibal,\r\none of the most brilliant commanders in the whole of history.  He\r\nmarched his army from Spain over the Alps into Italy, raised the Gauls\r\nagainst the Romans, and carried on the Second Punic War in Italy itself\r\nfor fifteen years.  He inflicted tremendous defeats upon the Romans at\r\nLake Trasimere and at Cannæ, and throughout all his Italian campaigns\r\nno Roman army stood against him and escaped disaster.  But a Roman army\r\nhad landed at Marseilles and cut his communications with Spain; he had\r\nno siege train, and he could never capture Rome.  Finally the\r\nCarthaginians, threatened by the revolt of the Numidians at home, were\r\nforced back upon the defence of their own city in Africa, a Roman army\r\ncrossed into Africa, and Hannibal experienced his first defeat under\r\nits walls at the battle of Zama (202 B.C. at the hands of Scipio\r\nAfricanus the Elder.  The battle of Zama ended this Second Punic War.\r\nCarthage capitulated; she surrendered Spain and her war fleet; she paid\r\nan enormous indemnity and agreed to give up Hannibal to the vengeance\r\nof the Romans.  But Hannibal escaped and fled to Asia where later,\r\nbeing in danger of falling into the hands of his relentless enemies, he\r\ntook poison and died.\r\n\r\nFor fifty-six years Rome and the shorn city of Carthage were at peace. \r\nAnd meanwhile Rome spread her empire over confused and divided Greece,\r\ninvaded Asia Minor, and defeated Antiochus III, the Seleucid monarch,\r\nat Magnesia in Lydia. She made Egypt, still under the Ptolemies, and\r\nPergamum and most of the small states of Asia Minor into “Allies,” or,\r\nas we should call them now, “protected states.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Carthage, subjugated and enfeebled, had been slowly regaining\r\nsomething of her former prosperity.  Her recovery revived the hate and\r\nsuspicion of the Romans.  She was attacked upon the most shallow and\r\nartificial of quarrels (149 B.C.), she made an obstinate and bitter\r\nresistance, stood a long siege and was stormed (146 B.C.). The street\r\nfighting, or massacre, lasted six days; it was extraordinarily bloody,\r\nand when the citadel capitulated only about fifty thousand of the\r\nCarthaginian population remained alive out of a quarter of a million. \r\nThey were sold into slavery, and the city was burnt and elaborately\r\ndestroyed.  The blackened ruins were ploughed and sown as a sort of\r\nceremonial effacement.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: The Extent of the Roman Power & its Alliances about 150 B.C.\r\n\r\nSo ended the Third Punic War.  Of all the Semitic states and cities\r\nthat had flourished in the world five centuries before only one little\r\ncountry remained free under native rulers. This was Judea, which had\r\nliberated itself from the Seleucids and was under the rule of the\r\nnative Maccabean princes. By this time it had its Bible almost\r\ncomplete, and was developing the distinctive traditions of the Jewish\r\nworld as we know it now.  It was natural that the Carthaginians,\r\nPhoenicians and kindred peoples dispersed about the world should find a\r\ncommon link in their practically identical language and in this\r\nliterature of hope and courage.  To a large extent they were still the\r\ntraders and bankers of the world.  The Semitic world had been submerged\r\nrather than replaced.\r\n\r\nJerusalem, which has always been rather the symbol than the centre of\r\nJudaism, was taken by the Romans in 65 B.C.; and after various\r\nvicissitudes of quasi- independence and revolt was besieged by them in\r\n70 A.D. and captured after a stubborn struggle. The Temple was\r\ndestroyed.  A later rebellion in 132 A.D. completed its destruction,\r\nand the Jerusalem we know to-day was rebuilt later under Roman\r\nauspices.  A temple to the Roman god, Jupiter Capitolinus, stood in the\r\nplace of the Temple, and Jews were forbidden to inhabit the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\nTHE GROWTH OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nNow this new Roman power which arose to dominate the western world in\r\nthe second and first centuries B.C. was in several respects a different\r\nthing from any of the great empires that had hitherto prevailed in the\r\ncivilized world. It was not at first a monarchy, and it was not the\r\ncreation of any one great conqueror. It was not indeed the first of\r\nrepublican empires; Athens had dominated a group of Allies and\r\ndependents in the time of Pericles, and Carthage when she entered upon\r\nher fatal struggle with Rome was mistress of Sardinia and Corsica,\r\nMorocco, Algiers, Tunis, and most of Spain and Sicily. But it was the\r\nfirst republican empire that escaped extinction and went on to fresh\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\nThe centre of this new system lay far to the west of the more ancient\r\ncentres of empire, which had hitherto been the river valleys of\r\nMesopotamia and Egypt.  This westward position enabled Rome to bring in\r\nto civilization quite fresh regions and peoples. The Roman power\r\nextended to Morocco and Spain, and was presently able to thrust\r\nnorth-westward over what is now France and Belgium to Britain and\r\nnorth-eastward into Hungary and South Russia.  But on the other hand it\r\nwas never able to maintain itself in Central Asia or Persia because\r\nthey were too far from its administrative centres.  It included\r\ntherefore great masses of fresh Nordic Aryan- speaking peoples, it\r\npresently incorporated nearly all the Greek people in the world, and\r\nits population was less strongly Hamitic and Semitic than that of any\r\npreceding empire.\r\n\r\nFor some centuries this Roman Empire did not fall into the grooves of\r\nprecedent that had so speedily swallowed up Persian and Greek, and all\r\nthat time it developed.  The rulers of the Medes and Persians became\r\nentirely Babylonized in a generation or so; they took over the tiara of\r\nthe king of kings and the temples and priesthoods of his gods;\r\nAlexander and his successors followed in the same easy path of\r\nassimilation; the Seleucid monarchs had much the same court and\r\nadministrative methods as Nebuchadnezzar; the Ptolemies became Pharaohs\r\nand altogether Egyptian.  They were assimilated just as before them the\r\nSemitic conquerors of the Sumerians had been assimilated.  But the\r\nRomans ruled in their own city, and for some centuries kept to the laws\r\nof their own nature.  The only people who exercised any great mental\r\ninfluence upon them before the second or third century A.D. were the\r\nkindred and similar Greeks.  So that the Roman Empire was essentially a\r\nfirst attempt to rule a great dominion upon mainly Aryan lines.  It was\r\nso far a new pattern in history, it was an expanded Aryan republic. \r\nThe old pattern of a personal conqueror ruling over a capital city that\r\nhad grown up round the temple of a harvest god did not apply to it. \r\nThe Romans had gods and temples, but like the gods of the Greeks their\r\ngods were quasi-human immortals, divine patricians.  The Romans also\r\nhad blood sacrifices and even made human ones in times of stress,\r\nthings they may have learnt to do from their dusky Etruscan teachers;\r\nbut until Rome was long past its zenith neither priest nor temple\r\nplayed a large part in Roman history.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Empire was a growth, an unplanned novel growth; the Roman\r\npeople found themselves engaged almost unawares in a vast\r\nadministrative experiment.  It cannot be called a successful\r\nexperiment.  In the end their empire collapsed altogether.  And it\r\nchanged enormously in form and method from century to century.  It\r\nchanged more in a hundred years than Bengal or Mesopotamia or Egypt\r\nchanged in a thousand. It was always changing.  It never attained to\r\nany fixity.\r\n\r\nIn a sense the experiment failed.  In a sense the experiment remains\r\nunfinished, and Europe and America to-day are still working out the\r\nriddles of world-wide statescraft first confronted by the Roman people.\r\n\r\nIt is well for the student of history to bear in mind the very great\r\nchanges not only in political but in social and moral matters that went\r\non throughout the period of Roman dominion.  There is much too strong a\r\ntendency in people’s minds to think of the Roman rule as something\r\nfinished and stable, firm, rounded, noble and decisive.  Macaulay’s\r\n_Lays of Ancient Rome_, S.P.Q.R. the elder Cato, the Scipios, Julius\r\nCæsar, Diocletian, Constantine the Great, triumphs, orations,\r\ngladiatorial combats and Christian martyrs are all mixed up together in\r\na picture of something high and cruel and dignified.  The items of that\r\npicture have to be disentangled.  They are collected at different\r\npoints from a process of change profounder than that which separates\r\nthe London of William the Conqueror from the London of to-day.\r\n\r\nWe may very conveniently divide the expansion of Rome into four stages.\r\n The first stage began after the sack of Rome by the Goths in 390 B.C.\r\nand went on until the end of the First Punic War (240 B.C,).  We may\r\ncall this stage the stage of the Assimilative Republic.  It was perhaps\r\nthe finest, most characteristic stage in Roman history.  The age-long\r\ndissensions of patrician and plebeian were drawing to it close, the\r\nEtruscan threat had come to an end, no one was very rich yet nor very\r\npoor, and most men were public-spirited.  It was a republic like the\r\nrepublic of the South African Boers before 1900 or like the northern\r\nstates of the American union between 1800 and 1850; a free- farmers\r\nrepublic.  At the outset of this stage Rome was a little state scarcely\r\ntwenty miles square.  She fought the sturdy but kindred states about\r\nher, and sought not their destruction but coalescence.  Her centuries\r\nof civil dissension had trained her people in compromise and\r\nconcessions.  Some of the defeated cities became altogether Roman with\r\na voting share in the government, some became self-governing with the\r\nright to trade and marry in Rome; garrisons full of citizens were set\r\nup at strategic points and colonies of varied privileges founded among\r\nthe freshly conquered people.  Great roads were made.  The rapid\r\nLatinization of all Italy was the inevitable consequence of such a\r\npolicy.  In 89 B.C. all the free inhabitants of Italy became citizens\r\nof the city of Rome.  Formally the whole Roman Empire became at last an\r\nextended city.  In 212 A.D. every free man in the entire extent of the\r\nempire was given citizenship; the right, if he could get there, to vote\r\nin the town meeting in Rome.\r\n\r\nThis extension of citizenship to tractable cities and to whole\r\ncountries was the distinctive device of Roman expansion.  It reversed\r\nthe old process of conquest and assimilation altogether.  By the Roman\r\nmethod the conquerors assimilated the conquered.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FORUM AT ROME AS IT IS TO-DAY\r\nTHE FORUM AT ROME AS IT IS TO-DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nBut after the First Punic War and the annexation of Sicily, though the\r\nold process of assimilation still went on, another process arose by its\r\nside.  Sicily for instance was treated as a conquered prey.  It was\r\ndeclared an “estate” of the Roman people.  Its rich soil and\r\nindustrious population was exploited to make Rome rich.  The patricians\r\nand the more influential among the plebeians secured the major share of\r\nthat wealth.  And the war also brought in a large supply of slaves. \r\nBefore the First Punic War the population of the republic had been\r\nlargely a population of citizen farmers.  Military service was their\r\nprivilege and liability.  While they were on active service their farms\r\nfell into debt and a new large-scale slave agriculture grew up; when\r\nthey returned they found their produce in competition with slave-grown\r\nproduce from Sicily and from the new estates at home.  Times had\r\nchanged.  The republic had altered its character.  Not only was Sicily\r\nin the hands of Rome, the common man was in the hands of the rich\r\ncreditor and the rich competitor.  Rome had entered upon its second\r\nstage, the Republic of Adventurous Rich Men.\r\n\r\nFor two hundred years the Roman soldier farmers had struggled for\r\nfreedom and a share in the government of their state; for a hundred\r\nyears they had enjoyed their privileges.  The First Punic War wasted\r\nthem and robbed them of all they had won.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELICS OF ROMAN RULE\r\nRELICS OF ROMAN RULE\r\n\r\nRuins of Coliseum in Tunis\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Jacques Boyer_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe value of their electoral privileges had also evaporated. The\r\ngoverning bodies of the Roman republic were two in number.  The first\r\nand more important was the Senate.  This was a body originally of\r\npatricians and then of prominent men of all sorts, who were summoned to\r\nit first by certain powerful officials, the consuls and censors.  Like\r\nthe British House of Lords it became a gathering of great landowners,\r\nprominent politicians, big business men and the like. It was much more\r\nlike the British House of Lords than it was like the American Senate. \r\nFor three centuries, from the Punic Wars onward, it was the centre of\r\nRoman political thought and purpose.  The second body was the Popular\r\nAssembly.  This was supposed to be an assembly of _all_ the citizens of\r\nRome.  When Rome was a little state twenty miles square this was a\r\npossible gathering.  When the citizenship of Rome had spread beyond the\r\nconfines in Italy, it was an altogether impossible one.  Its meetings,\r\nproclaimed by horn-blowing from the Capitol and the city walls, became\r\nmore and more a gathering of political hacks and city riff-raff.  In\r\nthe fourth century B.C. the Popular Assembly was a considerable check\r\nupon the Senate, a competent representation of the claims and rights of\r\nthe common man.  By the end of the Punic Wars it was an impotent relic\r\nof a vanquished popular control.  No effectual legal check remained\r\nupon the big men.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ROMAN ARCH AT CTESIPHON NEAR BAGDAD\r\nTHE GREAT ROMAN ARCH AT CTESIPHON NEAR BAGDAD\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing of the nature of representative government was ever introduced\r\ninto the Roman republic.  No one thought of electing delegates to\r\nrepresent the will of the citizens. This is a very important point for\r\nthe student to grasp.  The Popular Assembly never became the equivalent\r\nof the American House of Representatives or the British House of\r\nCommons.  In theory it was all the citizens; in practice it ceased to\r\nbe anything at all worth consideration.\r\n\r\nThe common citizen of the Roman Empire was therefore in a very poor\r\ncase after the Second Punic War; he was impoverished, he had often lost\r\nhis farm, he was ousted from profitable production by slaves, and he\r\nhad no political power left to him to remedy these things.  The only\r\nmethods of popular expression left to a people without any form of\r\npolitical expression are the strike and the revolt.  The story of the\r\nsecond and first centuries B.C., so far as internal politics go, is a\r\nstory of futile revolutionary upheaval.  The scale of this history will\r\nnot permit us to tell of the intricate struggles of that time, of the\r\nattempts to break up estates and restore the land to the free farmer,\r\nof proposals to abolish debts in whole or in part.  There was revolt\r\nand civil war.  In 73 B.C., the distresses of Italy were enhanced by a\r\ngreat insurrection, of the slaves under Spartacus.  The slaves of Italy\r\nrevolted with some effect, for among them were the trained fighters of\r\nthe gladiatorial shows.  For two years Spartacus held out in the crater\r\nof Vesuvius, which seemed at that time to be an extinct volcano. This\r\ninsurrection was defeated at last and suppressed with frantic cruelty. \r\nSix thousand captured Spartacists were crucified along the Appian Way,\r\nthe great highway that runs southward out of Rome (71 B.C.).\r\n\r\nThe common man never made head against the forces that were subjugating\r\nand degrading him.  But the big rich men who were overcoming him were\r\neven in his defeat preparing a new power in the Roman world over\r\nthemselves and him, the power of the army.\r\n\r\nBefore the Second Punic War the army of Rome was a levy of free\r\nfarmers, who, according to their quality, rode or marched afoot to\r\nbattle.  This was a very good force for wars close at hand, but not the\r\nsort of army that will go abroad and bear long campaigns with patience.\r\n And moreover as the slaves multiplied and the estates grew, the supply\r\nof free- spirited fighting farmers declined.  It was a popular leader\r\nnamed Marius who introduced a new factor.  North Africa after the\r\noverthrow of the Carthaginian civilization had become a semi-barbaric\r\nkingdom, the kingdom of Numidia.  The Roman power fell into conflict\r\nwith Jugurtha, king of this state, and experienced enormous\r\ndifficulties in subduing him. Marius was made consul, in a phase of\r\npublic indignation, to end this discreditable war.  This he did by\r\nraising _paid troops_ and drilling them hard.  Jugurtha was brought in\r\nchains to Rome (106 B.C.) and Marius, when his time of office had\r\nexpired, held on to his consulship illegally with his newly created\r\nlegions.  There was no power in Rome to restrain him.\r\n\r\nWith Marius began the third phase in the development of the Roman\r\npower, the Republic of the Military Commanders.  For now began a period\r\nin which the leaders of the paid legions fought for the mastery of the\r\nRoman world.  Against Marius was pitted the aristocratic Sulla who had\r\nserved under him in Africa.  Each in turn made a great massacre of his\r\npolitical opponents.  Men were proscribed and executed by the thousand,\r\nand their estates were sold.  After the bloody rivalry of these two and\r\nthe horror of the revolt of Spartacus, came a phase in which Lucullus\r\nand Pompey the Great and Crassus and Julius Cæsar were the masters of\r\narmies and dominated affairs.  It was Crassus who defeated Spartacus. \r\nLucullus conquered Asia Minor and penetrated to Armenia, and retired\r\nwith great wealth into private life.  Crassus thrusting further invaded\r\nPersia and was defeated and slain by the Parthians.  After a long\r\nrivalry Pompey was defeated by Julius Cæsar (48 B.C.) and murdered in\r\nEgypt, leaving Julius Cæsar sole master of the Roman world.\r\n\r\nThe figure of Julius Cæsar is one that has stirred the human\r\nimagination out of all proportion to its merit or true importance.  He\r\nhas become a legend and a symbol.  For us he is chiefly important as\r\nmarking the transition from the phase of military adventurers to the\r\nbeginning of the fourth stage in Roman expansion, the Early Empire. \r\nFor in spite of the profoundest economic and political convulsions, in\r\nspite of civil war and social degeneration, throughout all this time\r\nthe boundaries of the Roman state crept outward and continued to creep\r\noutward to their maximum about 100 A.D.  There had been something like\r\nan ebb during the doubtful phases of the Second Punic War, and again a\r\nmanifest loss of vigour before the reconstruction of the army by\r\nMarius. The revolt of Spartacus marked a third phase.  Julius Cæsar\r\nmade his reputation as a military leader in Gaul, which is now France\r\nand Belgium.  (The chief tribes inhabiting this country belonged to the\r\nsame Celtic people as the Gauls who had occupied north Italy for a\r\ntime, and who had afterwards raided into Asia Minor and settled down as\r\nthe Galatians.)  Cæsar drove back a German invasion of Gaul and added\r\nall that country to the empire, and he twice crossed the Straits of\r\nDover into Britain (55 and 54 B.C.), where however he made no permanent\r\nconquest.  Meanwhile Pompey the Great was consolidating Roman conquests\r\nthat reached in the east to the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLUMN OF TRAJAN AT ROME\r\nTHE COLUMN OF TRAJAN AT ROME\r\n\r\nRepresenting his conquests at Dacia and elsewhere\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, the middle of the first century B.C., the Roman Senate\r\nwas still the nominal centre of the Roman government, appointing\r\nconsuls and other officials, granting powers and the like; and a number\r\nof politicians, among whom Cicero was an outstanding figure, were\r\nstruggling to preserve the great traditions of republican Rome and to\r\nmaintain respect for its laws.  But the spirit of citizenship had gone\r\nfrom Italy with the wasting away of the free farmers; it was a land now\r\nof slaves and impoverished men with neither the understanding nor the\r\ndesire for freedom.  There was nothing whatever behind these republican\r\nleaders in the Senate, while behind the great adventurers they feared\r\nand desired to control were the legions.  Over the heads of the Senate\r\nCrassus and Pompey and Cæsar divided the rule of the Empire between\r\nthem (The First Triumvirate).  When presently Crassus was killed at\r\ndistant Carrhæ by the Parthians, Pompey and Cæsar fell out. Pompey took\r\nup the republican side, and laws were passed to bring Cæsar to trial\r\nfor his breaches of law and his disobedience to the decrees of the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nIt was illegal for a general to bring his troops out of the boundary of\r\nhis command, and the boundary between Cæsar’s command and Italy was the\r\nRubicon.  In 49 B.C. he crossed the Rubicon, saying “The die is cast”\r\nand marched upon Pompey and Rome.\r\n\r\nIt had been the custom in Rome in the past, in periods of military\r\nextremity, to elect a “dictator” with practically unlimited powers to\r\nrule through the crisis. After his overthrow of Pompey, Cæsar was made\r\ndictator first for ten years and then (in 45 B.C.) for life.  In effect\r\nhe was made monarch of the empire for life.  There was talk of a king,\r\na word abhorrent to Rome since the expulsion of the Etruscans five\r\ncenturies before.  Cæsar refused to be king, but adopted throne and\r\nsceptre.  After his defeat of Pompey, Cæsar had gone on into Egypt and\r\nhad made love to Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, the goddess\r\nqueen of Egypt.  She seems to have turned his head very completely.  He\r\nhad brought back to Rome the Egyptian idea of a god-king.  His statue\r\nwas set up in a temple with an inscription “To the Unconquerable God.” \r\nThe expiring republicanism of Rome flared up in a last protest, and\r\nCæsar was stabbed to death in the Senate at the foot of the statue of\r\nhis murdered rival, Pompey the Great.\r\n\r\nThirteen years more of this conflict of ambitious personalities\r\nfollowed.  There was a second Triumvirate of Lepidus, Mark Antony and\r\nOctavian Cæsar, the latter the nephew of Julius Cæsar.  Octavian like\r\nhis uncle took the poorer, hardier western provinces where the best\r\nlegions were recruited.  In 31 B.C., he defeated Mark Antony, his only\r\nserious rival, at the naval battle of Actium, and made himself sole\r\nmaster of the Roman world.  But Octavian was a man of different quality\r\naltogether from Julius Cæsar.  He had no foolish craving to be God or\r\nKing.  He had no queen-lover that he wished to dazzle.  He restored\r\nfreedom to the Senate and people of Rome.  He declined to be dictator. \r\nThe grateful Senate in return gave him the reality instead of the forms\r\nof power. He was to be called not King indeed, but “Princeps” and\r\n“Augustus.”  He became Augustus Cæsar, the first of the Roman emperors\r\n(27 B.C. to 14 A.D.).\r\n\r\nHe was followed by Tiberius Cæsar (14 to 37 A.D.) and he by others,\r\nCaligula, Claudius, Nero and so on up to Trajan (98 A.D.), Hadrian (117\r\nA.D.), Antonius Pius (138 A.D.) and Marcus Aurelius (161- 180 A.D.). \r\nAll these emperors were emperors of the legions.  The soldiers made\r\nthem, and some the soldiers destroyed.  Gradually the Senate fades out\r\nof Roman-history, and the emperor and his administrative officials\r\nreplace it.  The boundaries of the empire crept forward now to their\r\nutmost limits.  Most of Britain was added to the empire, Transylvania\r\nwas brought in as a new province, Dacia; Trajan crossed the Euphrates. \r\nHadrian had an idea that reminds us at once of what had happened at the\r\nother end of the old world.  Like Shi-Hwang-ti he built walls against\r\nthe northern barbarians; one across Britain and a palisade between the\r\nRhine and the Danube.  He abandoned some of the acquisitions of Trajan.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the Roman Empire was at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\nBETWEEN ROME AND CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second and first centuries B.C. mark a new phase in the history of\r\nmankind. Mesopotamia and the eastern Mediterranean are no longer the\r\ncentre of interest. Both Mesopotamia and Egypt were still fertile,\r\npopulous and fairly prosperous, but they were no longer the dominant\r\nregions of the world. Power had drifted to the west and to the east.\r\nTwo great empires now dominated the world, this new Roman Empire and\r\nthe renascent Empire of China. Rome extended its power to the\r\nEuphrates, but it was never able to get beyond that boundary. It was\r\ntoo remote. Beyond the Euphrates the former Persian and Indian\r\ndominions of the Seleucids fell under a number of new masters. China,\r\nnow under the Han dynasty, which had replaced the Ts’in dynasty at the\r\ndeath of Shi-Hwang-ti, had extended its power across Tibet and over the\r\nhigh mountain passes of the Pamirs into western Turkestan. But there,\r\ntoo, it reached its extremes. Beyond was too far.\r\n\r\nChina at this time was the greatest, best organized and most civilized\r\npolitical system in the world.  It was superior in area and population\r\nto the Roman Empire at its zenith.  It was possible then for these two\r\nvast systems to flourish in the same world at the same time in almost\r\ncomplete ignorance of each other.  The means of communication both by\r\nsea and land was not yet sufficiently developed and organized for them\r\nto come to a direct clash.\r\n\r\nYet they reacted upon each other in a very remarkable way, and their\r\ninfluence upon the fate of the regions that lay between them, upon\r\ncentral Asia and India, was profound.  A certain amount of trade\r\ntrickled through, by camel caravans across Persia, for example, and by\r\ncoasting ships by way of India and the Red Sea.  In 66 B.C. Roman\r\ntroops under Pompey followed in the footsteps of Alexander the Great,\r\nand marched up the eastern shores of the Caspian Sea.  In 102 A.D. a\r\nChinese expeditionary force under Pan Chau reached the Caspian, and\r\nsent emissaries to report upon the power of Rome.  But many centuries\r\nwere still to pass before definite knowledge and direct intercourse\r\nwere to link the great parallel worlds of Europe and Eastern Asia.\r\n\r\nTo the north of both these great empires were barbaric wildernesses. \r\nWhat is now Germany was largely forest lands; the forests extended far\r\ninto Russia and made a home for the gigantic aurochs, a bull of almost\r\nelephantine size.  Then to the north of the great mountain masses of\r\nAsia stretched a band of deserts, steppes and then forests and frozen\r\nlands. In the eastward lap of the elevated part of Asia was the great\r\ntriangle of Manchuria.  Large parts of these regions, stretching\r\nbetween South Russia and Turkestan into Manchuria, were and are regions\r\nof exceptional climatic insecurity. Their rainfall has varied greatly\r\nin the course of a few centuries  They are lands treacherous to man. \r\nFor years they will carry pasture and sustain cultivation, and then\r\nwill come an age of decline in humidity and a cycle of killing\r\ndroughts.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHINESE COVERED JAR OF GREEN-GLAZED EARTHENWARE\r\nA CHINESE COVERED JAR OF GREEN-GLAZED EARTHENWARE\r\n\r\nHan Dynasty (contemporary with the late Roman republic and early\r\nEmpire)\r\n\r\n_(In the Victoria and Albert Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe western part of this barbaric north from the German forests to\r\nSouth Russia and Turkestan and from Gothland to the Alps was the region\r\nof origin of the Nordic peoples and of the Aryan speech.  The eastern\r\nsteppes and deserts of Mongolia was the region of origin of the Hunnish\r\nor Mongolian or Tartar or Turkish peoples—for all these several peoples\r\nwere akin in language, race, and way of life.  And as the Nordic\r\npeoples seem to have been continually overflowing their own borders and\r\npressing south upon the developing civilizations of Mesopotamia and the\r\nMediterranean coast, so the Hunnish tribes sent their surplus as\r\nwanderers, raiders and conquerors into the settled regions of China. \r\nPeriods of plenty in the north would mean an increase in population\r\nthere; a shortage of grass, a spell of cattle disease, would drive the\r\nhungry warlike tribesmen south.\r\n\r\nFor a time there were simultaneously two fairly effective Empires in\r\nthe world capable of holding back the barbarians and even forcing\r\nforward the frontiers of the imperial peace. The thrust of the Han\r\nempire from north China into Mongolia was strong and continuous.  The\r\nChinese population welled up over the barrier of the Great Wall. \r\nBehind the imperial frontier guards came the Chinese farmer with horse\r\nand plough, ploughing up the grass lands and enclosing the winter\r\npasture.  The Hunnish peoples raided and murdered the settlers, but the\r\nChinese punitive expeditions were too much for them.  The nomads were\r\nfaced with the choice of settling down to the plough and becoming\r\nChinese tax-payers or shifting in search of fresh summer pastures. \r\nSome took the former course and were absorbed.  Some drifted\r\nnorth-eastward and eastward over the mountain passes down into western\r\nTurkestan.\r\n\r\n\r\nVASE OF BRONZE FORM, UNGLAZED STONEWARE\r\nVASE OF BRONZE FORM, UNGLAZED STONEWARE\r\n\r\nHan Dynasty (B.C. 206 - A.D. 220)\r\n\r\n_(In the Victoria and Albert Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis westward drive of the Mongolian horsemen was going on from 200\r\nB.C. onward.  It was producing a westward pressure upon the Aryan\r\ntribes, and these again were pressing upon the Roman frontiers ready to\r\nbreak through directly there was any weakness apparent.  The Parthians,\r\nwho were apparently a Scythian people with some Mongolian admixture,\r\ncame down to the Euphrates by the first century B.C.  They fought\r\nagainst Pompey the Great in his eastern raid.  They defeated and killed\r\nCrassus.  They replaced the Seleucid monarchy in Persia by a dynasty of\r\nParthian kings, the Arsacid dynasty.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINESE VESSEL IN BRONZE, IN FORM OF A GOOSE\r\nCHINESE VESSEL IN BRONZE, IN FORM OF A GOOSE\r\n\r\nDating from before the time of Shi-Hwang-ti.  Such a piece of work\r\nindicates a high level of comfort and humour\r\n\r\n_(In the Victoria and Albert Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nBut for a time the line of least resistance for hungry nomads lay\r\nneither to the west nor the east but through central Asia and then\r\nsouth-eastward through the Khyber Pass into India. It was India which\r\nreceived the Mongolian drive in these centuries of Roman and Chinese\r\nstrength.  A series of raiding conquerors poured down through the\r\nPunjab into the great plains to loot and destroy.  The empire of Asoka\r\nwas broken up, and for a time the history of India passes into\r\ndarkness. A certain Kushan dynasty founded by the “Indo- Scythians”—one\r\nof the raiding peoples—ruled for a time over North India and maintained\r\na certain order. These invasions went on for several centuries.  For a\r\nlarge part of the fifth century A.D. India was afflicted by the\r\nEphthalites or White Huns, who levied tribute on the small Indian\r\nprinces and held India in terror. Every summer these Ephthalites\r\npastured in western Turkestan, every autumn they came down through the\r\npasses to terrorize India.\r\n\r\nIn the second century A.D. a great misfortune came upon the Roman and\r\nChinese empires that probably weakened the resistance of both to\r\nbarbarian pressure.  This was a pestilence of unexampled virulence.  It\r\nraged for eleven years in China and disorganized the social framework\r\nprofoundly.  The Han dynasty fell, and a new age of division and\r\nconfusion began from which China did not fairly recover until the\r\nseventh century A.D. with the coming of the great Tang dynasty.\r\n\r\nThe infection spread through Asia to Europe.  It raged throughout the\r\nRoman Empire from 164 to 180 A.D.  It evidently weakened the Roman\r\nimperial fabric very seriously.  We begin to hear of depopulation in\r\nthe Roman provinces after this, and there was a marked deterioration in\r\nthe vigour and efficiency of government.  At any rate we presently find\r\nthe frontier no longer invulnerable, but giving way first in this place\r\nand then in that.  A new Nordic people, the Goths, coming originally\r\nfrom Gothland in Sweden, had migrated across Russia to the Volga region\r\nand the shores of the Black Sea and taken to the sea and piracy.  By\r\nthe end of the second century they may have begun to feel the westward\r\nthrust of the Huns.  In 247 they crossed the Danube in a great land\r\nraid, and defeated and killed the Emperor Decius in a battle in what is\r\nnow Serbia. In 236 another Germanic people, the Franks, had broken\r\nbounds upon the lower Rhine, and the Alemanni had poured into Alsace. \r\nThe legions in Gaul beat back their invaders, but the Goths in the\r\nBalkan peninsula raided again and again. The province of Dacia vanished\r\nfrom Roman history.\r\n\r\nA chill had come to the pride and confidence of Rome.  In 270-275 Rome,\r\nwhich had been an open and secure city for three centuries, was\r\nfortified by the Emperor Aurelian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\nTHE COMMON MAN’S LIFE UNDER THE EARLY ROMAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we tell of how this Roman empire which was built up in the two\r\ncenturies B.C., and which flourished in peace and security from the\r\ndays of Augustus Cæsar onward for two centuries, fell into disorder and\r\nwas broken up, it may be as well to devote some attention to the life\r\nof the ordinary people throughout this great realm. Our history has\r\ncome down now to within 2000 years of our own time; and the life of the\r\ncivilized people, both under the Peace of Rome and the Peace of the Han\r\ndynasty, was beginning to resemble more and more clearly the life of\r\ntheir civilized successors to-day.\r\n\r\nIn the western world coined money was now in common use; outside the\r\npriestly world there were many people of independent means who were\r\nneither officials of the government nor priests; people travelled about\r\nmore freely than they had ever done before, and there were high roads\r\nand inns for them. Compared with the past, with the time before 500\r\nB.C., life had become much more loose. Before that date civilized men\r\nhad been bound to a district or country, had been bound to a tradition\r\nand lived within a very limited horizon; only the nomads traded and\r\ntravelled.\r\n\r\nBut neither the Roman Peace nor the Peace of the Han dynasty meant a\r\nuniform civilization over the large areas they controlled.  There were\r\nvery great local differences and great contrasts and inequalities of\r\nculture between one district and another, just as there are to-day\r\nunder the British Peace in India.  The Roman garrisons and colonies\r\nwere dotted here and there over this great space, worshipping Roman\r\ngods and speaking the Latin language; but where there had been towns\r\nand cities before the coming of the Romans, they went on, subordinated\r\nindeed but managing their own affairs, and, for a time at least,\r\nworshipping their own gods in their own fashion.  Over Greece, Asia\r\nMinor, Egypt and the Hellenized East generally, the Latin language\r\nnever prevailed.  Greek ruled there invincibly.  Saul of Tarsus, who\r\nbecame the apostle Paul, was a Jew and a Roman citizen; but he spoke\r\nand wrote Greek and not Hebrew.  Even at the court of the Parthian\r\ndynasty, which had overthrown the Greek Seleucids in Persia, and was\r\nquite outside the Roman imperial boundaries, Greek was the fashionable\r\nlanguage.  In some parts of Spain and in North Africa, the Carthaginian\r\nlanguage also held on for a long time in spite of the destruction of\r\nCarthage.  Such a town as Seville, which had been a prosperous city\r\nlong before the Roman name had been heard of, kept its Semitic goddess\r\nand preserved its Semitic speech for generations, in spite of a colony\r\nof Roman veterans at Italica a few miles away.  Septimius Severus, who\r\nwas emperor from 193 to 211 A.D., spoke Carthaginian as his mother\r\nspeech.  He learnt Latin later as a foreign tongue; and it is recorded\r\nthat his sister never learnt Latin and conducted her Roman household in\r\nthe Punic language.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Gladiator (contemporary representation)\r\n\r\nIn such countries as Gaul and Britain and in provinces like Dacia (now\r\nroughly Roumania) and Pannonia (Hungary south of the Danube), where\r\nthere were no pre-existing great cities and temples and cultures, the\r\nRoman empire did however “Latinize.”  It civilized these countries for\r\nthe first time.  It created cities and towns where Latin was from the\r\nfirst the dominant speech, and where Roman gods were served and Roman\r\ncustoms and fashions followed.  The Roumanian, Italian, French and\r\nSpanish languages, all variations and modifications of Latin, remain to\r\nremind us of this extension of Latin speech and customs.  North-west\r\nAfrica also became at last largely Latin-speaking.  Egypt, Greece and\r\nthe rest of the empire to the east were never Latinized.  They remained\r\nEgyptian and Greek in culture and spirit.  And even in Rome, among\r\neducated men, Greek was learnt as the language of a gentleman and Greek\r\nliterature and learning were very, properly preferred to Latin.\r\n\r\nIn this miscellaneous empire the ways of doing work and business were\r\nnaturally also very miscellaneous.  The chief industry of the settled\r\nworld was still largely agriculture. We have told how in Italy the\r\nsturdy free farmers who were the backbone of the early Roman republic\r\nwere replaced by estates worked by slave labour after the Punic wars. \r\nThe Greek world had had very various methods of cultivation, from the\r\nArcadian plan, wherein every free citizen toiled with his own hands, to\r\nSparta, wherein it was a dishonour to work and where agricultural work\r\nwas done by a special slave class, the Helots.  But that was ancient\r\nhistory now, and over most of the Hellenized world the estate system\r\nand slave-gangs had spread.  The agricultural slaves were captives who\r\nspoke many different languages so that they could not understand each\r\nother, or they were born slaves; they had no solidarity to resist\r\noppression, no tradition of rights, no knowledge, for they could not\r\nread nor write.  Although they came to form a majority of the country\r\npopulation they never made a successful insurrection.  The insurrection\r\nof Spartacus in the first century B.C. was an insurrection of the\r\nspecial slaves who were trained for the gladiatorial combats. The\r\nagricultural workers in Italy in the latter days of the Republic and\r\nthe early Empire suffered frightful indignities; they would be chained\r\nat night to prevent escape or have half the head shaved to make it\r\ndifficult.  They had no wives of their own; they could be outraged,\r\nmutilated and killed by their masters.  A master could sell his slave\r\nto fight beasts in the arena.  If a slave slew his master, all the\r\nslaves in his household and not merely the murderer were crucified.  In\r\nsome parts of Greece, in Athens notably, the lot of the slave was never\r\nquite so frightful as this, but it was still detestable.  To such a\r\npopulation the barbarian invaders who presently broke through the\r\ndefensive line of the legions, came not as enemies but as liberators.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOMPEII\r\nPOMPEII\r\n\r\n“Note the ruts in roadway worn by chariot wheels.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe slave system had spread to most industries and to every sort of\r\nwork that could be done by gangs.  Mines and metallurgical operations,\r\nthe rowing of galleys, road-making and big building operations were all\r\nlargely slave occupations.  And almost all domestic service was\r\nperformed by slaves.  There were poor free-men and there were freed-men\r\nin the cities and upon the country side, working for themselves or even\r\nworking for wages.  They were artizans, supervisors and so forth,\r\nworkers of a new money- paid class working in competition with slave\r\nworkers; but we do not know what proportion they made of the general\r\npopulation.  It probably varied widely in different places and at\r\ndifferent periods.  And there were also many modifications of slavery,\r\nfrom the slavery that was chained at night and driven with whips to the\r\nfarm or quarry, to the slave whose master found it advantageous to\r\nleave him to cultivate his patch or work his craft and own his wife\r\nlike a free-man, provided he paid in a satisfactory quittance to his\r\nowner.\r\n\r\nThere were armed slaves.  At the opening of the period of the Punic\r\nwars, in 264 B.C., the Etruscan sport of setting slaves to fight for\r\ntheir lives was revived in Rome.  It grew rapidly fashionable; and soon\r\nevery great Roman rich man kept a retinue of gladiators, who sometimes\r\nfought in the arena but whose real business it was to act as his\r\nbodyguard of bullies.  And also there were learned slaves.  The\r\nconquests of the later Republic were among the highly civilized cities\r\nof Greece, North Africa and Asia Minor; and they brought in many highly\r\neducated captives. The tutor of a young Roman of good family was\r\nusually a slave.  A rich man would have a Greek slave as librarian, and\r\nslave secretaries and learned men.  He would keep his poet as he would\r\nkeep a performing dog.  In this atmosphere of slavery the traditions of\r\nmodern literary criticism were evolved.  The slaves still boast and\r\nquarrel in our reviews. There were enterprising people who bought\r\nintelligent boy slaves and had them educated for sale.  Slaves were\r\ntrained as book copyists, as jewellers, and for endless skilled\r\ncallings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLISEUM, ROME\r\nTHE COLISEUM, ROME\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Underwood & Underwood_\r\n\r\nINTERIOR OF THE COLISEUM AT IT APPEARS TO-DAY\r\nINTERIOR OF THE COLISEUM AT IT APPEARS TO-DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there were very considerable changes in the position of a slave\r\nduring the four hundred years between the opening days of conquest\r\nunder the republic of rich men and the days of disintegration that\r\nfollowed the great pestilence.  In the second century B.C. war-captives\r\nwere abundant, manners gross and brutal; the slave had no rights and\r\nthere was scarcely an outrage the reader can imagine that was not\r\npractised upon slaves in those days.  But already in the first century\r\nA.D. there was a perceptible improvement in the attitude of the Roman\r\ncivilization towards slavery.  Captives were not so abundant for one\r\nthing, and slaves were dearer.  And slave- owners began to realize that\r\nthe profit and comfort they got from their slaves increased with the\r\nself-respect of these unfortunates.  But also the moral tone of the\r\ncommunity was rising, and a sense of justice was becoming effective. \r\nThe higher mentality of Greece was qualifying the old Roman harshness. \r\nRestrictions upon cruelty were made, a master might no longer sell his\r\nslave to fight beasts, a slave was given property rights in what was\r\ncalled his _peculium_, slaves were paid wages as an encouragement and\r\nstimulus, a form of slave marriage was recognized.  Very many forms of\r\nagriculture do not lend themselves to gang working, or require gang\r\nworkers only at certain seasons.  In regions where such conditions\r\nprevailed the slave presently became a serf, paying his owner part of\r\nhis produce or working for him at certain seasons.\r\n\r\nWhen we begin to realize how essentially this great Latin and\r\nGreek-speaking Roman Empire of the first two centuries A.D. was a slave\r\nstate and how small was the minority who had any pride or freedom in\r\ntheir lives, we lay our hands on the clues to its decay and collapse. \r\nThere was little of what we should call family life, few homes of\r\ntemperate living and active thought and study; schools and colleges\r\nwere few and far between.  The free will and the free mind were nowhere\r\nto be found.  The great roads, the ruins of splendid buildings, the\r\ntradition of law and power it left for the astonishment of succeeding\r\ngenerations must not conceal from us that all its outer splendour was\r\nbuilt upon thwarted wills, stifled intelligence, and crippled and\r\nperverted desires.  And even the minority who lorded it over that wide\r\nrealm of subjugation and of restraint and forced labour were uneasy and\r\nunhappy in their souls; art and literature, science and philosophy,\r\nwhich are the fruits of free and happy minds, waned in that atmosphere.\r\n There was much copying and imitation, an abundance of artistic\r\nartificers, much slavish pedantry among the servile men of learning,\r\nbut the whole Roman empire in four centuries produced nothing to set\r\nbeside the bold and noble intellectual activities of the comparatively\r\nlittle city of Athens during its one century of greatness.  Athens\r\ndecayed under the Roman sceptre.  The science of Alexandria decayed.\r\nThe spirit of man, it seemed, was decaying in those days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\nRELIGIOUS DEVELOPMENTS UNDER THE ROMAN EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soul of man under that Latin and Greek empire of the first two\r\ncenturies of the Christian era was a worried and frustrated soul.\r\nCompulsion and cruelty reigned; there were pride and display but little\r\nhonour; little serenity or steadfast happiness. The unfortunate were\r\ndespised and wretched; the fortunate were insecure and feverishly eager\r\nfor gratifications. In a great number of cities life centred on the red\r\nexcitement of the arena, where men and beasts fought and were tormented\r\nand slain. Amphitheatres are the most characteristic of Roman ruins.\r\nLife went on in that key. The uneasiness of men’s hearts manifested\r\nitself in profound religious unrest.\r\n\r\nFrom the days when the Aryan hordes first broke in upon the ancient\r\ncivilizations, it was inevitable that the old gods of the temples and\r\npriesthoods should suffer great adaptations or disappear.  In the\r\ncourse of hundreds of generations the agricultural peoples of the\r\nbrunette civilizations had shaped their lives and thoughts to the\r\ntemple-centred life. Observances and the fear of disturbed routines,\r\nsacrifices and mysteries, dominated their minds.  Their gods seem\r\nmonstrous and illogical to our modern minds because we belong to an\r\nAryanized world, but to these older peoples these deities had the\r\nimmediate conviction and vividness of things seen in an intense dream. \r\nThe conquest of one city state by another in Sumeria or early Egypt\r\nmeant a change or a renaming of gods or goddesses, but left the shape\r\nand spirit of the worship intact.  There was no change in its general\r\ncharacter.  The figures in the dream changed, but the dream went on and\r\nit was the same sort of dream.  And the early Semitic conquerors were\r\nsufficiently akin in spirit to the Sumerians to take over the religion\r\nof the Mesopotamian civilization they subjugated without any profound\r\nalteration. Egypt was never indeed subjugated to the extent of a\r\nreligious revolution.  Under the Ptolemies and under the Cæsars, her\r\ntemples and altars and priesthoods remained essentially Egyptian.\r\n\r\nSo long as conquests went on between people of similar social and\r\nreligious habits it was possible to get over the clash between the god\r\nof this temple and region and the god of that by a process of grouping\r\nor assimilation.  If the two gods were alike in character they were\r\nidentified.  It was really the same god under another name, said the\r\npriests and the people.  This fusion of gods is called theocrasia; and\r\nthe age of the great conquests of the thousand years B.C. was an age of\r\ntheocrasia.  Over wide areas the local gods were displaced by, or\r\nrather they were swallowed up in, a general god.  So that when at last\r\nHebrew prophets in Babylon proclaimed one God of Righteousness in all\r\nthe earth men’s minds were fully prepared for that idea.\r\n\r\nBut often the gods were too dissimilar for such an assimilation, and\r\nthen they were grouped together in some plausible relationship.  A\r\nfemale god - and the Ægean world before the coming of the Greek was\r\nmuch addicted to Mother Gods—would be married to a male god, and an\r\nanimal god or a star god would be humanized and the animal or\r\nastronomical aspect, the serpent or the sun or the star, made into an\r\nornament or a symbol.  Or the god of a defeated people would become a\r\nmalignant antagonist to the brighter gods.  The history of theology is\r\nfull of such adaptations, compromises and rationalizations of once\r\nlocal gods.\r\n\r\nAs Egypt developed from city states into one united kingdom there was\r\nmuch of this theocrasia.  The chief god so to speak was Osiris, a\r\nsacrificial harvest god of whom Pharaoh was supposed to be the earthly\r\nincarnation.  Osiris was represented as repeatedly dying and rising\r\nagain; he was not only the seed and the harvest but also by a natural\r\nextension of thought the means of human immortality.  Among his symbols\r\nwas the wide-winged scarabeus beetle which buries its eggs to rise\r\nagain, and also the effulgent sun which sets to rise. Later on he was\r\nto be identified with Apis, the sacred bull. Associated with him was\r\nthe goddess Isis.  Isis was also Hathor, a cow-goddess, and the\r\ncrescent moon and the Star of the sea.  Osiris dies and she bears a\r\nchild, Horus, who is also a hawk-god and the dawn, and who grows to\r\nbecome Osiris again.  The effigies of Isis represent her as bearing the\r\ninfant Horus in her arms and standing on the crescent moon.  These are\r\nnot logical relationships, but they were devised by the human mind\r\nbefore the development of hard and systematic thinking and they have a\r\ndream-like coherence.  Beneath this triple group there are other and\r\ndarker Egyptian gods, bad gods, the dog-headed Anubis, black night and\r\nthe like, devourers, tempters, enemies of god and man.\r\n\r\n\r\nMITHRAS SACRIFICING A BULL, ROMAN\r\nMITHRAS SACRIFICING A BULL, ROMAN\r\n\r\n_(In the British Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery religious system does in the course of time fit itself to the\r\nshape of the human soul, and there can be no doubt that out of these\r\nillogical and even uncouth symbols, Egyptian people were able to\r\nfashion for themselves ways of genuine devotion and consolation.  The\r\ndesire for immortality was very strong in the Egyptian mind, and the\r\nreligious life of Egypt turned on that desire. The Egyptian religion\r\nwas an immortality religion as no other religion had ever been. As\r\nEgypt went down under foreign conquerors and the Egyptian gods ceased\r\nto have any satisfactory political significance, this craving for a\r\nlife of compensations here-after, intensified.\r\n\r\n\r\nISIS AND HORUS\r\nISIS AND HORUS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Greek conquest, the new city of Alexandria became the centre\r\nof Egyptian religious life, and indeed of the religious life of the\r\nwhole Hellenic world.  A great temple, the Serapeum, was set up by\r\nPtolemy I at which a sort of trinity of gods was worshipped. These were\r\nSerapis (who was Osiris-Apis rechristened), Isis and Horus. These were\r\nnot regarded as separate gods but as three aspects of one god, and\r\nSerapis was identified with the Greek Zeus, the Roman Jupiter and the\r\nPersian sun-god.  This worship spread wherever the Hellenic influence\r\nextended, even into North India and Western China.  The idea of\r\nimmortality, an immortality of compensations and consolation, was\r\neagerly received by a world in which the common life was hopelessly\r\nwretched.  Serapis was called “the saviour of souls.”  “After death,”\r\nsaid the hymns of that time, “we are still in the care of his\r\nprovidence.”  Isis attracted many devotees.  Her images stood in her\r\ntemples, as Queen of Heaven, bearing the infant Horus in her arms. \r\nCandles were burnt before her, votive offerings were made to her,\r\nshaven priests consecrated to celibacy waited on her altar.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the Roman empire opened the western European world to this\r\ngrowing cult.  The temples of Serapis-Isis, the chanting of the priests\r\nand the hope of immortal life, followed the Roman standards to Scotland\r\nand Holland.  But there were many rivals to the Serapis-Isis religion.\r\nProminent among these was Mithraism.  This was a religion of Persian\r\norigin, and it centred upon some now forgotten mysteries about Mithras\r\nsacrificing a sacred and benevolent bull.  Here we seem to have\r\nsomething more primordial than the complicated and sophisticated\r\nSerapis-Isis beliefs.  We are carried back directly to the blood\r\nsacrifices of the heliolithic stage in human culture.  The bull upon\r\nthe Mithraic monuments always bleeds copiously from a wound in its\r\nside, and from this blood springs new life.  The votary to Mithraism\r\nactually bathed in the blood of the sacrificial bull.  At his\r\ninitiation he went beneath a scaffolding upon which a bull was killed\r\nso that the blood could actually run down on him.\r\n\r\nBoth these religions, and the same is true of many other of the\r\nnumerous parallel cults that sought the allegiance of the slaves and\r\ncitizens under the earlier Roman emperors, are personal religions. \r\nThey aim at personal salvation and personal immortality.  The older\r\nreligions were not personal like that; they were social.  The older\r\nfashion of divinity was god or goddess of the city first or of the\r\nstate, and only secondarily of the individual.  The sacrifices were a\r\npublic and not a private function.  They concerned collective practical\r\nneeds in this world in which we live.  But the Greeks first and now the\r\nRomans had pushed religion out of politics.  Guided by the Egyptian\r\ntradition religion had retreated to the other world.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUST OF THE EMPEROR COMMODUS, A.D. 180-192\r\nBUST OF THE EMPEROR COMMODUS, A.D. 180-192\r\n\r\nRepresented as the God Mithras, Roman, Circa A.D. 190\r\n\r\n_(In the British Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThese new private immortality religions took all the heart and emotion\r\nout of the old state religions, but they did not actually replace them.\r\n A typical city under the earlier Roman emperors would have a number of\r\ntemples to all sorts of gods.  There might be a temple to Jupiter of\r\nthe Capitol, the great god of Rome, and there would probably be one to\r\nthe reigning Cæsar.  For the Cæsars had learnt from the Pharaohs the\r\npossibility of being gods.  In such temples a cold and stately\r\npolitical worship went on; one would go and make an offering and burn a\r\npinch of incense to show one’s loyalty.  But it would be to the temple\r\nof Isis, the dear Queen of Heaven, one would go with the burthen of\r\none’s private troubles for advice and relief.  There might be local and\r\neccentric gods.  Seville, for example, long affected the worship of the\r\nold Carthaginian Venus.  In a cave or an underground temple there would\r\ncertainly be an altar to Mithras, attended by legionaries and slaves. \r\nAnd probably also there would be a synagogue where the Jews gathered to\r\nread their Bible and uphold their faith in the unseen God of all the\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\nSometimes there would be trouble with the Jews about the political side\r\nof the state religion.  They held that their God was a jealous God\r\nintolerant of idolatry, and they would refuse to take part in the\r\npublic sacrifices to Cæsar. They would not even salute the Roman\r\nstandards for fear of idolatry.\r\n\r\nIn the East long before the time of Buddha there had been ascetics, men\r\nand women who gave up most of the delights of life, who repudiated\r\nmarriage and property and sought spiritual powers and an escape from\r\nthe stresses and mortifications of the world in abstinence, pain and\r\nsolitude. Buddha himself set his face against ascetic extravagances,\r\nbut many of his disciples followed a monkish life of great severity. \r\nObscure Greek cults practised similar disciplines even to the extent of\r\nself-mutilation.  Asceticism appeared in the Jewish communities of\r\nJudea and Alexandria also in the first century B.C.  Communities of men\r\nabandoned the world and gave themselves to austerities and mystical\r\ncontemplation.  Such was the sect of the Essenes.  Throughout the first\r\nand second centuries A.D. there was an almost world-wide resort to such\r\nrepudiations of life, a universal search for “salvation” from the\r\ndistresses of the time.  The old sense of an established order, the old\r\nconfidence in priest and temple and law and custom, had gone.  Amidst\r\nthe prevailing slavery, cruelty, fear, anxiety, waste, display and\r\nhectic self-indulgence, went this epidemic of self- disgust and mental\r\ninsecurity, this agonized search for peace even at the price of\r\nrenunciation and voluntary suffering. This it was that filled the\r\nSerapeum with weeping penitents and brought the converts into the gloom\r\nand gore of the Mithraic cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\nTHE TEACHING OF JESUS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was while Augustus Cæsar, the first of the Emperors, was reigning in\r\nRome that Jesus who is the Christ of Christianity was born in Judea. In\r\nhis name a religion was to arise which was destined to become the\r\nofficial religion of the entire Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nNow it is on the whole more convenient to keep history and theology\r\napart.  A large proportion of the Christian world believes that Jesus\r\nwas an incarnation of that God of all the Earth whom the Jews first\r\nrecognized.  The historian, if he is to remain historian, can neither\r\naccept nor deny that interpretation.  Materially Jesus appeared in the\r\nlikeness of a man, and it is as a man that the historian must deal with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe appeared in Judea in the reign of Tiberius Cæsar.  He was a prophet.\r\n He preached after the fashion of the preceding Jewish prophets.  He\r\nwas a man of about thirty, and we are in the profoundest ignorance of\r\nhis manner of life before his preaching began.\r\n\r\nOur only direct sources of information about the life and teaching of\r\nJesus are the four Gospels.  All four agree in giving us a picture of a\r\nvery definite personality.  One is obliged to say, “Here was a man. \r\nThis could not have been invented.”\r\n\r\nBut just as the personality of Gautama Buddha has been distorted and\r\nobscured by the stiff squatting figure, the gilded idol of later\r\nBuddhism, so one feels that the lean and strenuous personality of Jesus\r\nis much wronged by the unreality and conventionality that a mistaken\r\nreverence has imposed upon his figure in modern Christian art.  Jesus\r\nwas a penniless teacher, who wandered about the dusty sun-bit country\r\nof Judea, living upon casual gifts of food; yet he is always\r\nrepresented clean, combed and sleek, in spotless raiment, erect and\r\nwith something motionless about him as though he was gliding through\r\nthe air. This alone has made him unreal and incredible to many people\r\nwho cannot distinguish the core of the story from the ornamental and\r\nunwise additions of the unintelligently devout.\r\n\r\nWe are left, if we do strip this record of these difficult accessories,\r\nwith the figure of a being, very human, very earnest and passionate,\r\ncapable of swift anger, and teaching a new and simple and profound\r\ndoctrine—namely, the universal loving Fatherhood of God and the coming\r\nof the Kingdom of Heaven.  He was clearly a person—to use a common\r\nphrase—of intense personal magnetism.  He attracted followers and\r\nfilled them with love and courage. Weak and ailing people were\r\nheartened and healed by his presence.  Yet he was probably of a\r\ndelicate physique, because of the swiftness with which he died under\r\nthe pains of crucifixion.  There is a tradition that he fainted when,\r\naccording to the custom, he was made to bear his cross to the place of\r\nexecution.  He went about the country for three years spreading his\r\ndoctrine and then he came to Jerusalem and was accused of trying to set\r\nup a strange kingdom in Judea; he was tried upon this charge, and\r\ncrucified together with two thieves.  Long before these two were dead\r\nhis sufferings were over.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven, which was the main teaching of\r\nJesus, is certainly one of the most revolutionary doctrines that ever\r\nstirred and changed human thought.  It is small wonder if the world of\r\nthat time failed to grasp its full significance, and recoiled in dismay\r\nfrom even a half apprehension of its tremendous challenges to the\r\nestablished habits and institutions of mankind.  For the doctrine of\r\nthe Kingdom of Heaven, as Jesus seems to have preached it, was no less\r\nthan a bold and uncompromising demand for a complete change and\r\ncleansing of the life of our struggling race, an utter cleansing,\r\nwithout and within.  To the gospels the reader must go for all that is\r\npreserved of this tremendous teaching; here we are only concerned with\r\nthe jar of its impact upon established ideas.\r\n\r\nThe Jews were persuaded that God, the one God of the whole world, was a\r\nrighteous god, but they also thought of him as a trading god who had\r\nmade a bargain with their Father Abraham about them, a very good\r\nbargain indeed for them, to bring them at last to predominance in the\r\nearth. With dismay and anger they heard Jesus sweeping away their dear\r\nsecurities.  God, he taught, was no bargainer; there were no chosen\r\npeople and no favourites in the Kingdom of Heaven.  God was the loving\r\nfather of all life, as incapable of showing favour as the universal\r\nsun.  And all men were brothers—sinners alike and beloved sons alike—of\r\nthis divine father.  In the parable of the Good Samaritan Jesus cast\r\nscorn upon that natural tendency we all obey, to glorify our own people\r\nand to minimize the righteousness of other creeds and other races.  In\r\nthe parable of the labourers he thrust aside the obstinate claim of the\r\nJews to have a special claim upon God. All whom God takes into the\r\nkingdom, he taught, God serves alike; there is no distinction in his\r\ntreatment, because there is no measure to his bounty.  From all\r\nmoreover, as the parable of the buried talent witnesses, and as the\r\nincident of the widow’s mite enforces, he demands the utmost. There are\r\nno privileges, no rebates and no excuses in the Kingdom of Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY IDEAL PORTRAIT, IN GILDED GLASS, OF JESUS CHRIST IN WHICH THE\r\nTRADITIONAL BEARD IS NOT SHOWN\r\nEARLY IDEAL PORTRAIT, IN GILDED GLASS, OF JESUS CHRIST IN WHICH THE\r\nTRADITIONAL BEARD IS NOT SHOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is not only the intense tribal patriotism of the Jews that Jesus\r\noutraged.  They were a people of intense family loyalty, and he would\r\nhave swept away all the narrow and restrictive family affections in the\r\ngreat flood of the love of God.  The whole kingdom of Heaven was to be\r\nthe family of his followers.  We are told that, “While he yet talked to\r\nthe people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring\r\nto speak with him.  Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy\r\nbrethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.  But he answered\r\nand said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my\r\nbrethren? And he stretched forth his hands towards his disciples, and\r\nsaid, Behold my mother and my brethren!  For whosoever shall do the\r\nwill of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and\r\nsister, and mother.?

All men belonged to the kingdom; all their possessions\r\nbelonged to the kingdom; the righteous life for all men, the only\r\nrighteous life, was the service of God’s will with all that we had,\r\nwith all that we were. Again and again he denounced private riches and\r\nthe reservation of any private life.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVID’S TOWER AND WALL OF JERUSALEM\r\nDAVID’S TOWER AND WALL OF JERUSALEM\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Fannaway_\r\n\r\n\r\n“And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and\r\nkneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may\r\ninherit eternal life?  And Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good?\r\nthere is none good but one, that is God.  Thou knowest the\r\ncommandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not\r\nbear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.  And he\r\nanswered and said unto him, Master, all these things have I observed\r\nfrom my youth.  Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him,\r\nOne thing thou lackest; go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give\r\nto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, take up\r\nthe cross, and follow me.  And he was sad at that saying, and went away\r\ngrieved; for he had great possessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nA STREET IN JERUSALEM\r\nA STREET IN JERUSALEM\r\n\r\nAlong such a thoroughfare Christ carried his cross to the place of\r\nexecution\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Fannaway_\r\n\r\n\r\n“And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly\r\nshall they that have riches enter into the Kingdom of God!  And the\r\ndisciples were astonished at his words.  But Jesus answered again, and\r\nsaith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches\r\nto enter into the Kingdom of God!  It is easier for a camel to go\r\nthrough the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the\r\nKingdom of God.”  [2]\r\n\r\nMoreover, in his tremendous prophecy of this kingdom which was to make\r\nall men one together in God, Jesus had small patience for the\r\nbargaining righteousness of formal religion. Another large part of his\r\nrecorded utterances is aimed against the meticulous observance of the\r\nrules of the pious career.  “Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him,\r\nWhy walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders,\r\nbut eat bread with unwashen hands?  He answered and said unto them,\r\nWell hath Isaiah prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written,\r\n\r\n“This people honoureth me with their lips,\r\n\r\n“But their heart is far from me.\r\n\r\n“Howbeit in vain do they worship me,\r\n\r\n“Teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.\r\n\r\n“For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men,\r\nas the washing of pots and cups: and many other such things ye do.  And\r\nhe said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye\r\nmay keep your own tradition.”  [3]\r\n\r\nIt was not merely a moral and a social revolution that Jesus\r\nproclaimed; it is clear from a score of indications that his teaching\r\nhad a political bent of the plainest sort.  It is true that he said his\r\nkingdom was not of this world, that it was in the hearts of men and not\r\nupon a throne; but it is equally clear that wherever and in what\r\nmeasure his kingdom was set up in the hearts of men, the outer world\r\nwould be in that measure revolutionized and made new.\r\n\r\nWhatever else the deafness and blindness of his hearers may have missed\r\nin his utterances, it is plain they did not miss his resolve to\r\nrevolutionize the world.  The whole tenor of the opposition to him and\r\nthe circumstances of his trial and execution show clearly that to his\r\ncontemporaries he seemed to propose plainly, and did propose plainly,\r\nto change and fuse and enlarge all human life.\r\n\r\nIn view of what he plainly said, is it any wonder that all who were\r\nrich and prosperous felt a horror of strange things, a swimming of\r\ntheir world at his teaching?  He was dragging out all the little\r\nprivate reservations they had made from social service into the light\r\nof a universal religious life.  He was like some terrible moral\r\nhuntsman digging mankind out of the snug burrows in which they had\r\nlived hitherto.  In the white blaze of this kingdom of his there was to\r\nbe no property, no privilege, no pride and precedence; no motive indeed\r\nand no reward but love.  Is it any wonder that men were dazzled and\r\nblinded and cried out against him?  Even his disciples cried out when\r\nhe would not spare them the light. Is it any wonder that the priests\r\nrealized that between this man and themselves there was no choice but\r\nthat he or priestcraft should perish?  Is it any wonder that the Roman\r\nsoldiers, confronted and amazed by something soaring over their\r\ncomprehension and threatening all their disciplines, should take refuge\r\nin wild laughter, and crown him with thorns and robe him in purple and\r\nmake a mock Cæsar of him?  For to take him seriously was to enter upon\r\na strange and alarming life, to abandon habits, to control instincts\r\nand impulses, to essay an incredible happiness. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Matt. xii, 46-50.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] Mark x, 17-25.\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] Mark vii, 1-9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF DOCTRINAL CHRISTIANITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the four gospels we find the personality and teachings of Jesus but\r\nvery little of the dogmas of the Christian church. It is in the\r\nepistles, a series of writings by the immediate followers of Jesus,\r\nthat the broad lines of Christian belief are laid down.\r\n\r\nChief among the makers of Christian doctrine was St. Paul. He had never\r\nseen Jesus nor heard him preach.  Paul’s name was originally Saul, and\r\nhe was conspicuous at first as an active persecutor of the little band\r\nof disciples after the crucifixion.  Then he was suddenly converted to\r\nChristianity, and he changed his name to Paul.  He was a man of great\r\nintellectual vigour and deeply and passionately interested in the\r\nreligious movements of the time.  He was well versed in Judaism and in\r\nthe Mithraism and Alexandrian religion of the day.  He carried over\r\nmany of their ideas and terms of expression into Christianity.  He did\r\nvery little to enlarge or develop the original teaching of Jesus, the\r\nteaching of the Kingdom of Heaven.  But he taught that Jesus was not\r\nonly the promised Christ, the promised leader of the Jews, but also\r\nthat his death was a sacrifice, like the deaths of the ancient\r\nsacrificial victims of the primordial civilizations, for the redemption\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nWhen religions flourish side by side they tend to pick up each other’s\r\nceremonial and other outward peculiarities.  Buddhism, for example, in\r\nChina has now almost the same sort of temples and priests and uses as\r\nTaoism, which follows in the teachings of Lao Tse.  Yet the original\r\nteachings of Buddhism and Taoism were almost flatly opposed.  And it\r\nreflects no doubt or discredit upon the essentials of Christian\r\nteaching that it took over not merely such formal things as the shaven\r\npriest, the votive offering, the altars, candles, chanting and images\r\nof the Alexandrian and Mithraic faiths, but adopted even their\r\ndevotional phrases and their theological ideas.  All these religions\r\nwere flourishing side by side with many less prominent cults. Each was\r\nseeking adherents, and there must have been a constant going and coming\r\nof converts between them. Sometimes one or other would be in favour\r\nwith the government.  But Christianity was regarded with more suspicion\r\nthan its rivals because, like the Jews, its adherents would not perform\r\nacts of worship to the God Cæsar.  This made it a seditious religion,\r\nquite apart from the revolutionary spirit of the teachings of Jesus\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSAIC OF SS. PETER AND PAUL POINTING TO A THRONE, ON GOLD BACKGROUND\r\nMOSAIC OF SS. PETER AND PAUL POINTING TO A THRONE, ON GOLD BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nFrom the Ninth Century original, in the Church of Sta. Prassede, Rome\r\n\r\n_(In the Victoria and Albert Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Paul familiarized his disciples with the idea that Jesus, like\r\nOsiris, was a god who died to rise again and give men immortality.  And\r\npresently the spreading Christian community was greatly torn by\r\ncomplicated theological disputes about the relationship of this God\r\nJesus to God the Father of Mankind.  The Arians taught that Jesus was\r\ndivine, but distant from and inferior to the Father.  The Sabellians\r\ntaught that Jesus was merely an aspect of the Father, and that God was\r\nJesus and Father at the same time just as a man may be a father and an\r\nartificer at the same time; and the Trinitarians taught a more subtle\r\ndoctrine that God was both one and three, Father, Son and Holy Spirit. \r\nFor a time it seemed that Arianism would prevail over its rivals, and\r\nthen after disputes, violence and wars, the Trinitarian formula became\r\nthe accepted formula of all Christendom.  It may be found in its\r\ncompletest expression in the Athanasian Creed.\r\n\r\nWe offer no comment on these controversies here.  They do not sway\r\nhistory as the personal teaching of Jesus sways history. The personal\r\nteaching of Jesus does seem to mark a new phase in the moral and\r\nspiritual life of our race.  Its insistence upon the universal\r\nFatherhood of God and the implicit brotherhood of all men, its\r\ninsistence upon the sacredness of every human personality as a living\r\ntemple of God, was to have the profoundest effect upon all the\r\nsubsequent social and political life of mankind.  With Christianity,\r\nwith the spreading teachings of Jesus, a new respect appears in the\r\nworld for man as man.  It may be true, as hostile critics of\r\nChristianity have urged, that St.. Paul preached obedience to slaves,\r\nbut it is equally true that the whole spirit of the teachings of Jesus\r\npreserved in the gospels was against the subjugation of man by man. \r\nAnd still more distinctly was Christianity opposed to such outrages\r\nupon human dignity as the gladiatorial combats in the arena.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BAPTISM OF CHRIST\r\nTHE BAPTISM OF CHRIST\r\n\r\n_(Sixth Century Ivory Panel in the British Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the first two centuries after Christ, the Christian religion\r\nspread throughout the Roman Empire, weaving together an ever-growing\r\nmultitude of converts into a new community of ideas and will.  The\r\nattitude of the emperors varied between hostility and toleration. \r\nThere were attempts to suppress this new faith in both the second and\r\nthird centuries; and finally in 303 and the following years a great\r\npersecution under the Emperor Diocletian.  The considerable\r\naccumulations of Church property were seized, all bibles and religious\r\nwritings were confiscated and destroyed, Christians were put out of the\r\nprotection of the law and many executed.  The destruction of the books\r\nis particularly notable.  It shows how the power of the written word in\r\nholding together the new faith was appreciated by the authorities. \r\nThese “book religions,” Christianity and Judaism, were religions that\r\neducated. Their continued existence depended very largely on people\r\nbeing able to read and understand their doctrinal ideas.  The older\r\nreligions had made no such appeal to the personal intelligence.  In the\r\nages of barbaric confusion that were now at hand in western Europe it\r\nwas the Christian church that was mainly instrumental in preserving the\r\ntradition of learning.\r\n\r\nThe persecution of Diocletian failed completely to suppress the growing\r\nChristian community.  In many provinces it was ineffective because the\r\nbulk of the population and many of the officials were Christian.  In\r\n317 an edict of toleration was issued by the associated Emperor\r\nGalerius, and in 324 Constantine the Great, a friend and on his\r\ndeathbed a baptized convert to Christianity, became sole ruler of the\r\nRoman world.  He abandoned all divine pretensions and put Christian\r\nsymbols on the shields and banners of his troops.\r\n\r\nIn a few years Christianity was securely established as the official\r\nreligion of the empire.  The competing religions disappeared or were\r\nabsorbed with extraordinary celerity, and in 300 Theodosius the Great\r\ncaused the great statue of Jupiter Serapis at Alexandria to be\r\ndestroyed.  From the outset of the fifth century onward the only\r\npriests or temples in the Roman Empire were Christian priests and\r\ntemples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX\r\nTHE BARBARIANS BREAK THE EMPIRE INTO EAST AND WEST\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the third century the Roman Empire, decaying socially and\r\ndisintegrating morally, faced the barbarians. The emperors of this\r\nperiod were fighting military autocrats, and the capital of the empire\r\nshifted with the necessities of their military policy. Now the imperial\r\nheadquarters would be at Milan in north Italy, now in what is now\r\nSerbia at Sirmium or Nish, now in Nicomedia in Asia Minor. Rome halfway\r\ndown Italy was too far from the centre of interest to be a convenient\r\nimperial seat. It was a declining city. Over most of the empire peace\r\nstill prevailed and men went about without arms. The armies continued\r\nto be the sole repositories of power; the emperors, dependent on their\r\nlegions, became more and more autocratic to the rest of the empire and\r\ntheir state more and more like that of the Persian and other oriental\r\nmonarchs. Diocletian assumed a royal diadem and oriental robes.\r\n\r\nAll along the imperial frontier, which ran roughly along the Rhine and\r\nDanube, enemies were now pressing.  The Franks and other German tribes\r\nhad come up to the Rhine.  In north Hungary were the Vandals; in what\r\nwas once Dacia and is now Roumania, the Visigoths or West Goths. \r\nBehind these in south Russia were the East Goths or Ostrogoths, and\r\nbeyond these again in the Volga region the Alans.  But now Mongolian\r\npeoples were forcing their way towards Europe.  The Huns were already\r\nexacting tribute from the Alans and Ostrogoths and pushing them to the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nIn Asia the Roman frontiers were crumpling back under the push of a\r\nrenascent Persia.  This new Persia, the Persia of the Sassenid kings,\r\nwas to be a vigorous and on the whole a successful rival of the Roman\r\nEmpire in Asia for the next three centuries.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map of Europe will show the reader the peculiar\r\nweakness of the empire.  The river Danube comes down to within a couple\r\nof hundred miles of the Adriatic Sea in the region of what is now\r\nBosnia and Serbia. It makes a square re-entrant angle there.  The\r\nRomans never kept their sea communications in good order, and this two\r\nhundred mile strip of land was their line of communication between the\r\nwestern Latin-speaking part of the empire and the eastern\r\nGreek-speaking portion.  Against this square angle of the Danube the\r\nbarbarian pressure was greatest.  When they broke through there it was\r\ninevitable that the empire should fall into two parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: The Empire and the Barbarians\r\n\r\nA more vigorous empire might have thrust forward and reconquered Dacia,\r\nbut the Roman Empire lacked any such vigour.  Constantine the Great was\r\ncertainly a monarch of great devotion and intelligence.  He beat back a\r\nraid of the Goths from just these vital Balkan regions, but he had no\r\nforce to carry the frontier across the Danube.  He was too pre-occupied\r\nwith the internal weaknesses of the empire.  He brought the solidarity\r\nand moral force of Christianity to revive the spirit of the declining\r\nempire, and he decided to create a new permanent capital at Byzantium\r\nupon the Hellespont.  This new-made Byzantium, which was re-christened\r\nConstantinople in his honour, was still building when he died.  Towards\r\nthe end of his reign occurred a remarkable transaction.  The Vandals,\r\nbeing pressed by the Goths, asked to be received into the Roman Empire.\r\n They were assigned lands in Pannonia, which is now that part of\r\nHungary west of the Danube, and their fighting men became nominally\r\nlegionaries.  But these new legionaries remained under their own\r\nchiefs.  Rome failed to digest them.\r\n\r\nConstantine died working to reorganize his great realm, and soon the\r\nfrontiers were ruptured again and the Visigoths came almost to\r\nConstantinople. They defeated the Emperor Valens at Adrianople and made\r\na settlement in what is now Bulgaria, similar to the settlement of the\r\nVandals in Pannonia. Nominally they were subjects of the emperor,\r\npractically they were conquerors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTANTINE’S PILLAR, CONSTANTINOPLE\r\nCONSTANTINE’S PILLAR, CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Sebah & Foaillier_\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 379 to 395 A.D. reigned the Emperor Theodosius the Great, and\r\nwhile he reigned the empire was still formally intact.  Over the armies\r\nof Italy and Pannonia presided Stilicho, a Vandal, over the armies in\r\nthe Balkan peninsula, Alaric, a Goth.  When Theodosius died at the\r\nclose of the fourth century he left two sons. Alaric supported one of\r\nthese, Arcadius, in Constantinople, and Stilicho the other, Honorius,\r\nin Italy.  In other words Alaric and Stilicho fought for the empire\r\nwith the princes as puppets.  In the course of their struggle Alaric\r\nmarched into Italy and after a short siege took Rome (410 A.D.).\r\n\r\nThe opening half of the fifth century saw the whole of the Roman Empire\r\nin Europe the prey of robber armies of barbarians.  It is difficult to\r\nvisualize the state of affairs in the world at that time.  Over France,\r\nSpain, Italy and the Balkan peninsula, the great cities that had\r\nflourished under the early empire still stood, impoverished, partly\r\ndepopulated and falling into decay.  Life in them must have been\r\nshallow, mean and full of uncertainty.  Local officials asserted their\r\nauthority and went on with their work with such conscience as they had,\r\nno doubt in the name of a now remote and inaccessible emperor.  The\r\nchurches went on, but usually with illiterate priests.  There was\r\nlittle reading and much superstition and fear.  But everywhere except\r\nwhere looters had destroyed them, books and pictures and statuary and\r\nsuch-like works of art were still to be found.\r\n\r\nThe life of the countryside had also degenerated.  Everywhere this\r\nRoman world was much more weedy and untidy than it had been.  In some\r\nregions war and pestilence had brought the land down to the level of a\r\nwaste.  Roads and forests were infested with robbers.  Into such\r\nregions the barbarians marched, with little or no opposition, and set\r\nup their chiefs as rulers, often with Roman official titles.  If they\r\nwere half civilized barbarians they would give the conquered districts\r\ntolerable terms, they would take possession of the towns, associate and\r\nintermarry, and acquire (with an accent) the Latin speech; but the\r\nJutes, the Angles and Saxons who submerged the Roman province of\r\nBritain were agriculturalists and had no use for towns, they seem to\r\nhave swept south Britain clear of the Romanized population and they\r\nreplaced the language by their own Teutonic dialects, which became at\r\nlast English.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASE OF THE “OBELISK OF THEODOSIUS,” CONSTANTINOPLE\r\nBASE OF THE “OBELISK OF THEODOSIUS,” CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n\r\nThe obelisk of Thothmes, taken from Egypt to Constantinople by\r\nTheodosius and placed upon the pedestal her shown; an interesting\r\nexample of early Byzantine art.  The complete obelisk is seen on page\r\n239.\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Sebah & Foaillier_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible in the space at our disposal to trace the movements of\r\nall the various German and Slavonic tribes as they went to and fro in\r\nthe disorganized empire in search of plunder and a pleasant home.  But\r\nlet the Vandals serve as an example.  They came into history in east\r\nGermany.  They settled as we have told in Pannonia.  Thence they moved\r\nsomewhen about 425 A.D. through the intervening provinces to Spain. \r\nThere they found Visigoths from South Russia and other German tribes\r\nsetting up dukes and kings.  From Spain the Vandals under Genseric\r\nsailed for North Africa (429), captured Carthage (439), and built a\r\nfleet.  They secured the mastery of the sea and captured and pillaged\r\nRome (455), which had recovered very imperfectly from her capture and\r\nlooting by Alaric half a century earlier.  Then the Vandals made\r\nthemselves masters of Sicily, Corsica, Sardinia and most of the other\r\nislands of the western Mediterranean.  They made, in fact, a sea empire\r\nvery similar in its extent to the sea empire of Carthage seven hundred\r\nodd years before.  They were at the climax of their power about 477. \r\nThey were a mere handful of conquerors holding all this country.  In\r\nthe next century almost all their territory had been reconquered for\r\nthe empire of Constantinople during a transitory blaze of energy under\r\nJustinian I.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Vandals is but one sample of a host of similar\r\nadventures.  But now there was coming into the European world the least\r\nkindred and most redoubtable of all these devastators, the Mongolian\r\nHuns or Tartars, a yellow people active and able, such as the western\r\nworld had never before encountered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL\r\nTHE HUNS AND THE END OF THE WESTERN EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis appearance of a conquering Mongolian people in Europe may be taken\r\nto mark a new stage in human history. Until the last century or so\r\nbefore the Christian era, the Mongol and the Nordic peoples had not\r\nbeen in close touch. Far away in the frozen lands beyond the northern\r\nforests the Lapps, a Mongolian people, had drifted westward as far as\r\nLapland, but they played no part in the main current of history. For\r\nthousands of years the western world carried on the dramatic interplay\r\nof the Aryan, Semitic and fundamental brunette peoples with very little\r\ninterference (except for an Ethiopian invasion of Egypt or so) either\r\nfrom the black peoples to the south or from the Mongolian world in the\r\nfar East.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that there were two chief causes for the new westward\r\ndrift of the nomadic Mongolians.  One was the consolidation of the\r\ngreat empire of China, its extension northward and the increase of its\r\npopulation during the prosperous period of the Han dynasty.  The other\r\nwas some process of climatic change; a lesser rainfall that abolished\r\nswamps and forests perhaps, or a greater rainfall that extended grazing\r\nover desert steppes, or even perhaps both these processes going on in\r\ndifferent regions but which anyhow facilitated a westward migration.  A\r\nthird contributary cause was the economic wretchedness, internal decay\r\nand falling population of the Roman Empire.  The rich men of the later\r\nRoman Republic, and then the tax-gatherers of the military emperors had\r\nutterly consumed its vitality. So we have the factors of thrust, means\r\nand opportunity. There was pressure from the east, rot in the west and\r\nan open road.\r\n\r\nThe Hun had reached the eastern boundaries of European Russia by the\r\nfirst century A.D., but it was not until the fourth and fifth centuries\r\nA.D. that these horsemen rose to predominance upon the steppes.  The\r\nfifth century was the Hun’s century. The first Huns to come into Italy\r\nwere mercenary bands in the pay of Stilicho the Vandal, the master of\r\nHonorius. Presently they were in possession of Pannonia, the empty nest\r\nof the Vandals.\r\n\r\nBy the second quarter of the fifth century a great war chief had arisen\r\namong the Huns, Attila.  We have only vague and tantalizing glimpses of\r\nhis power.  He ruled not only over the Huns but over a conglomerate of\r\ntributary Germanic tribes; his empire extended from the Rhine cross the\r\nplains into Central Asia.  He exchanged ambassadors with China.  His\r\nhead camp was in the plain of Hungary east of the Danube. There he was\r\nvisited by an envoy from Constantinople, Priscus, who has left us an\r\naccount of his state.  The way of living of these Mongols was very like\r\nthe way of living of the primitive Aryans they had replaced.  The\r\ncommon folk were in huts and tents; the chiefs lived in great stockaded\r\ntimber halls.  There were feasts and drinking and singing by the bards.\r\n The Homeric heroes and even the Macedonian companions of Alexander\r\nwould probably have felt more at home in the camp-capital of Attila\r\nthan they would have done in the cultivated and decadent court of\r\nTheodosius II, the son of Arcadius, who was then reigning in\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nFor a time it seemed as though the nomads under the leadership of the\r\nHuns and Attila would play the same part towards the Græco-Roman\r\ncivilization of the Mediterranean countries that the barbaric Greeks\r\nhad played long ago to the Ægean civilization.  It looked like history\r\nrepeating itself upon a larger stage.  But the Huns were much more\r\nwedded to the nomadic life than the early Greeks, who were rather\r\nmigratory cattle farmers than true nomads.  The Huns raided and\r\nplundered but did not settle.\r\n\r\nFor some years Attila bullied Theodosius as he chose.  His armies\r\ndevastated and looted right down to the walls of Constantinople, Gibbon\r\nsays that he totally destroyed no less than seventy cities in the\r\nBalkan peninsula, and Theodosius bought him off by payments of tribute\r\nand tried to get rid of him for good by sending secret agents to\r\nassassinate him.  In 451 Attila turned his attention to the remains of\r\nthe Latin- speaking half of the empire and invaded Gaul.  Nearly every\r\ntown in northern Gaul was sacked.  Franks, Visigoths and the imperial\r\nforces united against him and he was defeated at Troyes in a vast\r\ndispersed battle in which a multitude of men, variously estimated as\r\nbetween 150,000 and 300,000, were killed. This checked him in Gaul, but\r\nit did not exhaust his enormous military resources.  Next year he came\r\ninto Italy by way of Venetia, burnt Aquileia and Padua and looted\r\nMilan.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAD OF BARBARIAN CHIEF\r\nHEAD OF BARBARIAN CHIEF\r\n\r\n_(In the British Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nNumbers of fugitives from these north Italian towns and particularly\r\nfrom Padua fled to islands in the lagoons at the head of the Adriatic\r\nand laid there the foundations of the city state of Venice, which was\r\nto become one of the greatest or the trading centres in the middle\r\nages.\r\n\r\nIn 453 Attila died suddenly after a great feast to celebrate his\r\nmarriage to a young woman, and at his death this plunder confederation\r\nof his fell to pieces.  The actual Huns disappear from history, mixed\r\ninto the surrounding more numerous Aryan-speaking populations.  But\r\nthese great Hun raids practically consummated the end of the Latin\r\nRoman Empire.  After his death ten different emperors ruled in Rome in\r\ntwenty years, set up by Vandal and other mercenary troops.  The Vandals\r\nfrom Carthage took and sacked Rome in 455.  Finally in 476 Odoacer, the\r\nchief of the barbarian troops, suppressed a Pannonian who was figuring\r\nas emperor under the impressive name of Romulus Augustulus, and\r\ninformed the Court of Constantinople that there was no longer an\r\nemperor in the west.  So ingloriously the Latin Roman Empire came to an\r\nend.  In 493 Theodoric the Goth became King of Rome.\r\n\r\nAll over western and central Europe now barbarian chiefs were reigning\r\nas kings, dukes and the like, practically independent but for the most\r\npart professing some sort of shadowy allegiance to the emperor.  There\r\nwere hundreds and perhaps thousands of such practically independent\r\nbrigand rulers.  In Gaul, Spain and Italy and in Dacia the Latin speech\r\nstill prevailed in locally distorted forms, but in Britain and east of\r\nthe Rhine languages of the German group (or in Bohemia a Slavonic\r\nlanguage, Czech) were the common speech.  The superior clergy and a\r\nsmall remnant of other educated men read and wrote Latin.  Everywhere\r\nlife was insecure and property was held by the strong arm.  Castles\r\nmultiplied and roads fell into decay.  The dawn of the sixth century\r\nwas an age of division and of intellectual darkness throughout the\r\nwestern world.  Had it not been for the monks and Christian\r\nmissionaries Latin learning might have perished altogether.\r\n\r\nWhy had the Roman Empire grown and why had it so completely decayed? \r\nIt grew because at first the idea of citizenship held it together. \r\nThroughout the days of the expanding republic, and even into the days\r\nof the early empire there remained a great number of men conscious of\r\nRoman citizenship, feeling it a privilege and an obligation to be a\r\nRoman citizen, confident of their rights under the Roman law and\r\nwilling to make sacrifices in the name of Rome.  The prestige of Rome\r\nas of something just and great and law- upholding spread far beyond the\r\nRoman boundaries.  But even as early as the Punic wars the sense of\r\ncitizenship was being undermined by the growth of wealth and slavery. \r\nCitizenship spread indeed but not the idea of citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Empire was after all a very primitive organization; it did\r\nnot educate, did not explain itself to its increasing multitudes of\r\ncitizens, did not invite their co-operation in its decisions.  There\r\nwas no network of schools to ensure a common understanding, no\r\ndistribution of news to sustain collective activity.  The adventurers\r\nwho struggled for power from the days of Marius and Sulla onward had no\r\nidea of creating and calling in public opinion upon the imperial\r\naffairs.  The spirit of citizenship died of starvation and no one\r\nobserved it die.  All empires, all states, all organizations of human\r\nsociety are, in the ultimate, things of understanding and will.  There\r\nremained no will for the Roman Empire in the World and so it came to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nBut though the Latin-speaking Roman Empire died in the fifth century,\r\nsomething else had been born within it that was to avail itself\r\nenormously of its prestige and tradition, and that was the\r\nLatin-speaking half of the Catholic Church. This lived while the empire\r\ndied because it appealed to the minds and wills of men, because it had\r\nbooks and a great system of teachers and missionaries to hold it\r\ntogether, things stronger than any law or legions.  Throughout the\r\nfourth and fifth centuries A.D. while the empire was decaying,\r\nChristianity was spreading to a universal dominion in Europe.  It\r\nconquered its conquerors, the barbarians.  When Attila seemed disposed\r\nto march on Rome, the patriarch of Rome intercepted him and did what no\r\narmies could do, turning him back by sheer moral force.\r\n\r\nThe Patriarch or Pope of Rome claimed to be the head of the entire\r\nChristian church.  Now that there were no more emperors, he began to\r\nannex imperial titles and claims.  He took the title of _pontifex\r\nmaximus_, head sacrificial priest of the Roman dominion, the most\r\nancient of all the titles that the emperors had enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI\r\nTHE BYZANTINE AND SASSANID EMPIRES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greek-speaking eastern half of the Roman Empire showed much more\r\npolitical tenacity than the western half. It weathered the disasters of\r\nthe fifth century A.D., which saw a complete and final breaking up of\r\nthe original Latin Roman power. Attila bullied the Emperor Theodosius\r\nII and sacked and raided almost to the walls of Constantinople, but\r\nthat city remained intact. The Nubians came down the Nile and looted\r\nUpper Egypt, but Lower Egypt and Alexandria were left still fairly\r\nprosperous. Most of Asia Minor was held against the Sassanid Persians.\r\n\r\nThe sixth century, which was an age of complete darkness for the West,\r\nsaw indeed a considerable revival of the Greek power.  Justinian I\r\n(527-565) was a ruler of very great ambition and energy, and he was\r\nmarried to the Empress Theodora, a woman of quite equal capacity who\r\nhad begun life as an actress.  Justinian reconquered North Africa from\r\nthe Vandals and most of Italy from the Goths.  He even regained the\r\nsouth of Spain.  He did not limit his energies to naval and military\r\nenterprises.  He founded a university, built the great church of Sta.\r\nSophia in Constantinople and codified the Roman law.  But in order to\r\ndestroy a rival to his university foundation he closed the schools of\r\nphilosophy in Athens, which had been going on in unbroken continuity\r\nfrom the days of Plato, that is to say for nearly a thousand years.\r\n\r\nFrom the third century onwards the Persian Empire had been the\r\nsteadfast rival of the Byzantine.  The two empires kept Asia Minor,\r\nSyria and Egypt in a state of perpetual unrest and waste.  In the first\r\ncentury A.D., these lands were still at a high level of civilization,\r\nwealthy and with an abundant population, but the continual coming and\r\ngoing of armies, massacres, looting and war taxation wore them down\r\nsteadily until only shattered and ruinous cities remained upon a\r\ncountryside of scattered peasants.  In this melancholy process of\r\nimpoverishment and disorder lower Egypt fared perhaps less badly than\r\nthe rest of the world.  Alexandria, like Constantinople, continued a\r\ndwindling trade between the east and the west.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH (NOW A MOSQUE) OF S. SOPHIA, CONSTANTINOPLE\r\nTHE CHURCH (NOW A MOSQUE) OF S. SOPHIA, CONSTANTINOPLE\r\n\r\nThe obelisk of Theodosius in in the foreground statue on left\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Sebah & Foaillier_\r\n\r\n\r\nScience and political philosophy seemed dead now in both these warring\r\nand decaying empires.  The last philosophers of Athens, until their\r\nsuppression, preserved the texts of the great literature of the past\r\nwith an infinite reverence and want of understanding.  But there\r\nremained no class of men in the world, no free gentlemen with bold and\r\nindependent habits of thought, to carry on the tradition of frank\r\nstatement and enquiry embodied in these writings.  The social and\r\npolitical chaos accounts largely for the disappearance of this class,\r\nbut there was also another reason why the human intelligence was\r\nsterile and feverish during this age.  In both Persia and Byzantium it\r\nwas all age of intolerance.  Both empires were religious empires in a\r\nnew way, in a way that greatly hampered the free activities of the\r\nhuman mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAGNIFICENT ROOF-WORK IN S. SOPHIA\r\nTHE MAGNIFICENT ROOF-WORK IN S. SOPHIA\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Sebah & Foaillier_\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course the oldest empires in the world were religious empires,\r\ncentring upon the worship of a god or of a god-king. Alexander was\r\ntreated as a divinity and the Cæsars were gods in so much as they had\r\naltars and temples devoted to them and the offering of incense was made\r\na test of loyalty to the Roman state.  But these older religions were\r\nessentially religions of act and fact.  They did not invade the mind. \r\nIf a man offered his sacrifice and bowed to the god, he was left not\r\nonly to think but to say practically whatever he liked about the\r\naffair.  But the new sort of religions that had come into the world,\r\nand particularly Christianity, turned inward.  These new faiths\r\ndemanded not simply conformity but understanding belief.  Naturally\r\nfierce controversy ensued upon the exact meaning of the things\r\nbelieved.  These new religions were creed religions.  The world was\r\nconfronted with a new word, Orthodoxy, and with a stern resolve to keep\r\nnot only acts but speech and private thought within the limits of a set\r\nteaching.  For to hold a wrong opinion, much more to convey it to other\r\npeople, was no longer regarded as an intellectual defect but a moral\r\nfault that might condemn a soul to everlasting destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAVENNA PANEL, DEPICTING JUSTINIAN AND HIS COURT\r\nTHE RAVENNA PANEL, DEPICTING JUSTINIAN AND HIS COURT\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Alinari_\r\n\r\nTHE ROCK HEWN TEMPLE AT PETRA\r\nTHE ROCK HEWN TEMPLE AT PETRA\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Underwood & Underwood_\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth Ardashir I who founded the Sassanid dynasty in the third century\r\nA.D., and Constantine the Great who reconstructed the Roman Empire in\r\nthe fourth, turned to religious organizations for help, because in\r\nthese organizations they saw a new means of using and controlling the\r\nwills of men.  And already before the end of the fourth century both\r\nempires were persecuting free talk and religious innovation.  In Persia\r\nArdashir found the ancient Persian religion of Zoroaster (or\r\nZarathushtra) with its priests and temples and a sacred fire that burnt\r\nupon its altars, ready for his purpose as a state religion.  Before the\r\nend of the third century Zoroastrianism was persecuting Christianity,\r\nand in 277 A.D. Mani, the founder of a new faith, the Manichæans, was\r\ncrucified and his body flayed. Constantinople, on its side, was busy\r\nhunting out Christian heresies.  Manichæan ideas infected Christianity\r\nand had to be fought with the fiercest methods; in return ideas from\r\nChristianity affected the purity of the Zoroastrian doctrine. All ideas\r\nbecame suspect.  Science, which demands before all things the free\r\naction of an untroubled mind, suffered a complete eclipse throughout\r\nthis phase of intolerance.\r\n\r\nWar, the bitterest theology, and the usual vices of mankind constituted\r\nByzantine life of those days.  It was picturesque, it was romantic; it\r\nhad little sweetness or light.  When Byzantium and Persia were not\r\nfighting the barbarians from the north, they wasted Asia Minor and\r\nSyria in dreary and destructive hostilities.  Even in close alliance\r\nthese two empires would have found it a hard task to turn back the\r\nbarbarians and recover their prosperity.  The Turks or Tartars first\r\ncome into history as the allies first of one power and then of another.\r\n In the sixth century the two chief antagonists were Justinian and\r\nChosroes I; in the opening of the seventh the Emperor Heraclius was\r\npitted against Chosroes II (580).\r\n\r\nAt first and until after Heraclius had become Emperor (610) Chosroes II\r\ncarried all before him.  He took Antioch, Damascus and Jerusalem and\r\nhis armies reached Chalcedon, which is in Asia Minor over against\r\nConstantinople.  In 619 he conquered Egypt.  Then Heraclius pressed a\r\ncounter attack home and routed a Persian army at Nineveh (627),\r\nalthough at that time there were still Persian troops at Chalcedon.  In\r\n628 Chosroes II was deposed and murdered by his son, Kavadh, and an\r\ninconclusive peace was made between the two exhausted empires.\r\n\r\nByzantium and Persia had fought their last war.  But few people as yet\r\ndreamt of the storm that was even then gathering in the deserts to put\r\nan end for ever to this aimless, chronic struggle.\r\n\r\nWhile Heraclius was restoring order in Syria a message reached him.  It\r\nhad been brought in to the imperial outpost at Bostra south of\r\nDamascus; it was in Arabic, an obscure Semitic desert language, and it\r\nwas read to the Emperor, if it reached him at all, by an interpreter. \r\nIt was from someone who called himself “Muhammad the Prophet of God.” \r\nIt called upon the Emperor to acknowledge the One True God and to serve\r\nhim.  What the Emperor said is not recorded.\r\n\r\nA similar message came to Kavadh at Ctesiphon.  He was annoyed, tore up\r\nthe letter, and bade the messenger begone.\r\n\r\nThis Muhammad, it appeared, was a Bedouin leader whose headquarters\r\nwere in the mean little desert town of Medina. He was preaching a new\r\nreligion of faith in the One True God.\r\n\r\n“Even so, O Lord!” he said; “rend thou his Kingdom from Kavadh.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII\r\nTHE DYNASTIES OF SUY AND TANG IN CHINA\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth centuries, there was a\r\nsteady drift of Mongolian peoples westward. The Huns of Attila were\r\nmerely precursors of this advance, which led at last to the\r\nestablishment of Mongolian peoples in Finland, Esthonia, Hungary and\r\nBulgaria, where their descendants, speaking languages akin to Turkish,\r\nsurvive to this day. The Mongolian nomads were, in fact, playing a role\r\ntowards the Aryanized civilizations of Europe and Persia and India that\r\nthe Aryans had played to the Ægean and Semitic civilizations ten or\r\nfifteen centuries before.\r\n\r\nIn Central Asia the Turkish peoples had taken root in what is now\r\nWestern Turkestan, and Persia already employed many Turkish officials\r\nand Turkish mercenaries.  The Parthians had gone out of history,\r\nabsorbed into the general population of Persia.  There were no more\r\nAryan nomads in the history of Central Asia; Mongolian people had\r\nreplaced them.  The Turks became masters of Asia from China to the\r\nCaspian.\r\n\r\nThe same great pestilence at the end of the second century A.D. that\r\nhad shattered the Roman Empire had overthrown the Han dynasty in China.\r\n Then came a period of division and of Hunnish conquests from which\r\nChina arose refreshed, more rapidly and more completely than Europe was\r\ndestined to do.  Before the end of the sixth century China was reunited\r\nunder the Suy dynasty, and this by the time of Heraclius gave place to\r\nthe Tang dynasty, whose reign marks another great period of prosperity\r\nfor China.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINESE EARTHENWARE ART OF THE TANG DYNASTY, 616-906\r\nCHINESE EARTHENWARE ART OF THE TANG DYNASTY, 616-906\r\n\r\nSpecimens in glazed earthenware, in brown, green and buff, discovered\r\nin tombs in China\r\n\r\n_(In the Victoria and Albert Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the seventh, eighth and ninth centuries China was the most\r\nsecure and civilized country in the world.  The Han dynasty had\r\nextended her boundaries in the north; the Suy and Tang dynasties now\r\nspread her civilization to the south, and China began to assume the\r\nproportions she has to-day.  In Central Asia indeed she reached much\r\nfurther, extending at last, through tributary Turkish tribes, to Persia\r\nand the Caspian Sea.\r\n\r\nThe new China that had arisen was a very different land from the old\r\nChina of the Hans.  A new and more vigorous literary school appeared,\r\nthere was a great poetic revival; Buddhism had revolutionized\r\nphilosophical and religious thought. There were great advances in\r\nartistic work, in technical skill and in all the amenities of life. \r\nTea was first used, paper manufactured and wood-block printing began. \r\nMillions of people indeed were leading orderly, graceful and kindly\r\nlives in China during these centuries when the attenuated populations\r\nof Europe and Western Asia were living either in hovels, small walled\r\ncities or grim robber fortresses.  While the mind of the west was black\r\nwith theological obsessions, the mind of China was open and tolerant\r\nand enquiring.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest monarchs of the Tang dynasty was Tai- tsung, who\r\nbegan to reign in 627, the year of the victory of Heraclius at Nineveh.\r\n He received an embassy from Heraclius, who was probably seeking an\r\nally in the rear of Persia.  From Persia itself came a party of\r\nChristian missionaries (635). They were allowed to explain their creed\r\nto Tai-tsung and he examined a Chinese translation of their Scriptures.\r\n He pronounced this strange religion acceptable, and gave permission\r\nfor the foundation of a church and monastery.\r\n\r\nTo this monarch also (in 628) came messengers from Muhammad. They came\r\nto Canton on a trading ship.  They had sailed the whole way from Arabia\r\nalong the Indian coasts.  Unlike Heraclius and Kavadh, Tai-Tsung gave\r\nthese envoys a courteous hearing.  He expressed his interest in their\r\ntheological ideas and assisted them to build a mosque in Canton, a\r\nmosque which survives, it is said, to this day, the oldest mosque in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII\r\nMUHAMMAD AND ISLAM\r\n\r\n\r\nA prophetic amateur of history surveying the world in the opening of\r\nthe seventh century might have concluded very reasonably that it was\r\nonly a question of a few centuries before the whole of Europe and Asia\r\nfell under Mongolian domination. There were no signs of order or union\r\nin Western Europe, and the Byzantine and Persian Empires were\r\nmanifestly bent upon a mutual destruction. India also was divided and\r\nwasted. On the other hand China was a steadily expanding empire which\r\nprobably at that time exceeded all Europe in population, and the\r\nTurkish people who were growing to power in Central Asia were disposed\r\nto work in accord with China. And such a prophecy would not have been\r\nan altogether vain one. A time was to come in the thirteenth century\r\nwhen a Mongolian overlord would rule from the Danube to the Pacific,\r\nand Turkish dynasties were destined to reign over the entire Byzantine\r\nand Persian Empires, over Egypt and most of India.\r\n\r\nWhere our prophet would have been most likely to have erred would have\r\nbeen in under-estimating the recuperative power of the Latin end of\r\nEurope and in ignoring the latent forces of the Arabian desert.  Arabia\r\nwould have seemed what it had been for times immemorial, the refuge of\r\nsmall and bickering nomadic tribes.  No Semitic people had founded an\r\nempire now for more than a thousand years.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the Bedouin flared out for a brief century of splendour. \r\nThey spread their rule and language from Spain to the boundaries of\r\nChina.  They gave the world a new culture. They created a religion that\r\nis still to this day one of the most vital forces in the world.\r\n\r\nThe man who fired this Arab flame appears first in history as the young\r\nhusband of the widow of a rich merchant of the town of Mecca, named\r\nMuhammad.  Until he was forty he did very little to distinguish himself\r\nin the world.  He seems to have taken considerable interest in\r\nreligious discussion.  Mecca was a pagan city at that time worshipping\r\nin particular a black stone, the Kaaba, of great repute throughout all\r\nArabia and a centre of pilgrimages; but there were great numbers of\r\nJews in the country—indeed all the southern portion of Arabia professed\r\nthe Jewish faith—and there were Christian churches in Syria.\r\n\r\nAbout forty Muhammad began to develop prophetic characteristics like\r\nthose of the Hebrew prophets twelve hundred years before him.  He\r\ntalked first to his wife of the One True God, and of the rewards and\r\npunishments of virtue and wickedness.  There can be no doubt that his\r\nthoughts were very strongly influenced by Jewish and Christian ideas. \r\nHe gathered about him a small circle of believers and presently began\r\nto preach in the town against the prevalent idolatry. This made him\r\nextremely unpopular with his fellow townsmen because the pilgrimages to\r\nthe Kaaba were the chief source of such prosperity as Mecca enjoyed. \r\nHe became bolder and more definite in his teaching, declaring himself\r\nto be the last chosen prophet of God entrusted with a mission to\r\nperfect religion.  Abraham, he declared, and Jesus Christ were his\r\nforerunners.  He had been chosen to complete and perfect the revelation\r\nof God’s will.\r\n\r\nHe produced verses which he said had been communicated to him by an\r\nangel, and he had a strange vision in which he was taken up through the\r\nHeavens to God and instructed in his mission.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT PRAYER IN THE DESERT\r\nAT PRAYER IN THE DESERT\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Lehnert & Landrock_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs his teaching increased in force the hostility of his fellow townsmen\r\nincreased also.  At last a plot was made to kill him; but he escaped\r\nwith his faithful friend and disciple, Abu Bekr, to the friendly town\r\nof Medina which adopted his doctrine.  Hostilities followed between\r\nMecca and Medina which ended at last in a treaty.  Mecca was to adopt\r\nthe worship of the One True God and accept Muhammad as his prophet,\r\n_but the adherents of the new faith were still to make the pilgrimage\r\nto Mecca_ just as they had done when they were pagans.  So Muhammad\r\nestablished the One True God in Mecca without injuring its pilgrim\r\ntraffic.  In 629 Muhammad returned to Mecca as its master, a year after\r\nhe had sent out these envoys of his to Heraclius, Tai-tsung, Kavadh and\r\nall the rulers of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOOKING ACROSS THE SEA OF SAND\r\nLOOKING ACROSS THE SEA OF SAND\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Lehnert & Landrock_\r\n\r\n\r\nThen for four years more until his death in 632, Muhammad spread his\r\npower over the rest of Arabia.  He married a number of wives in his\r\ndeclining years, and his life on the whole was by modern standards\r\nunedifying.  He seems to have been a man compounded of very\r\nconsiderable vanity, greed, cunning, self-deception and quite sincere\r\nreligious passion. He dictated a book of injunctions and expositions,\r\nthe Koran, which he declared was communicated to him from God. \r\nRegarded as literature or philosophy the Koran is certainly unworthy of\r\nits alleged Divine authorship.\r\n\r\nYet when the manifest defects of Muhammad’s life and writings have been\r\nallowed for, there remains in Islam, this faith he imposed upon the\r\nArabs, much power and inspiration. One is its uncompromising\r\nmonotheism; its simple enthusiastic faith in the rule and fatherhood of\r\nGod and its freedom from theological complications.  Another is its\r\ncomplete detachment from the sacrificial priest and the temple.  It is\r\nan entirely prophetic religion, proof against any possibility of\r\nrelapse towards blood sacrifices.  In the Koran the limited and\r\nceremonial nature of the pilgrimage to Mecca is stated beyond the\r\npossibility of dispute, and every precaution was taken by Muhammad to\r\nprevent the deification of himself after his death.  And a third\r\nelement of strength lay in the insistence of Islam upon the perfect\r\nbrotherhood and equality before God of all believers, whatever their\r\ncolour, origin or status.\r\n\r\nThese are the things that made Islam a power in human affairs.  It has\r\nbeen said that the true founder of the Empire of Islam was not so much\r\nMuhammad as his friend and helper, Abu Bekr.  If Muhammad, with his\r\nshifty character, was the mind and imagination of primitive Islam, Abu\r\nBekr was its conscience and its will.  Whenever Muhammad wavered Abu\r\nBekr sustained him.  And when Muhammad died, Abu Bekr became Caliph (=\r\nsuccessor), and with that faith that moves mountains, he set himself\r\nsimply and sanely to organize the subjugation of the whole world to\r\nAllah—with little armies of 3,000 or 4,000 Arabs—according to those\r\nletters the prophet had written from Medina in 628 to all the monarchs\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV\r\nTHE GREAT DAYS OF THE ARABS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere follows the most amazing story of conquest in the whole history\r\nof our race. The Byzantine army was smashed at the battle of the Yarmuk\r\n(a tributary of the Jordan) in 634; and the Emperor Heraclius, his\r\nenergy sapped by dropsy and his resources exhausted by the Persian war,\r\nsaw his new conquests in Syria, Damascus, Palmyra, Antioch, Jerusalem\r\nand the rest fall almost without resistance to the Moslim. Large\r\nelements in the population went over to Islam. Then the Moslim turned\r\neast. The Persians had found an able general in Rustam; they had a\r\ngreat host with a force of elephants; and for three days they fought\r\nthe Arabs at Kadessia (637) and broke at last in headlong rout.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of all Persia followed, and the Moslem Empire pushed far\r\ninto Western Turkestan and eastward until it met the Chinese.  Egypt\r\nfell almost without resistance to the new conquerors, who full of a\r\nfanatical belief in the sufficiency of the Koran, wiped out the\r\nvestiges of the book-copying industry of the Alexandria Library.  The\r\ntide of conquest poured along the north coast of Africa to the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar and Spain.  Spain was invaded in 710 and the Pyrenees\r\nMountains were reached in 720.  In 732 the Arab advance had reached the\r\ncentre of France, but here it was stopped for good at the battle of\r\nPoitiers and thrust back as far as the Pyrenees again.  The conquest of\r\nEgypt had given the Moslim a fleet, and for a time it looked as though\r\nthey would take Constantinople.  They made repeated sea attacks between\r\n672 and 718 but the great city held out against them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: The Growth of the Moslem Power in 25 Years\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: The Moslem Empire, 750 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs had little political aptitude and no political experience,\r\nand this great empire with its capital now at Damascus, which stretched\r\nfrom Spain to China, was destined to break up very speedily. From the\r\nvery beginning doctrinal differences undermined its unity.  But our\r\ninterest here lies not with the story of its political disintegration\r\nbut with its effect upon the human mind and upon the general destinies\r\nof our race.  The Arab intelligence had been flung across the world\r\neven more swiftly and dramatically than had the Greek a thousand years\r\nbefore.  The intellectual stimulation of the whole world west of China,\r\nthe break-up of old ideas and development of new ones, was enormous.\r\n\r\nIn Persia this fresh excited Arabic mind came into contact not only\r\nwith Manichæan, Zoroastrian and Christian doctrine, but with the\r\nscientific Greek literature, preserved not only in Greek but in Syrian\r\ntranslations.  It found Greek learning in Egypt also. Every-where, and\r\nparticularly in Spain, it discovered an active Jewish tradition of\r\nspeculation and discussion.  In Central Asia it met Buddhism and the\r\nmaterial achievements of Chinese civilization.  It learnt the\r\nmanufacture of paper—which made printed books possible—from the\r\nChinese.  And finally it came into touch with Indian mathematics and\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM, SHOWING THE MOSQUE OF OMAR\r\nJERUSALEM, SHOWING THE MOSQUE OF OMAR\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Lehnert & Landrock_\r\n\r\n\r\nVery speedily the intolerant self-sufficiency of the early days of\r\nfaith, which made the Koran seem the only possible book, was dropped.\r\nLearning sprang up everywhere in the footsteps of the Arab conquerors. \r\nBy the eighth century there was an educational organization throughout\r\nthe whole “Arabized” world.  In the ninth learned men in the schools of\r\nCordoba in Spain were corresponding with learned men in Cairo, Bagdad,\r\nBokhara and Samarkand.  The Jewish mind assimilated very readily with\r\nthe Arab, and for a time the two Semitic races worked together through\r\nthe medium of Arabic.  Long after the political break-up and\r\nenfeeblement of the Arabs, this intellectual community of the\r\nArab-speaking world endured.  It was still producing very considerable\r\nresults in the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIEW OF CAIRO MOSQUES\r\nVIEW OF CAIRO MOSQUES\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Lehnert & Landrock_\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it was that the systematic accumulation and criticism of facts which\r\nwas first begun by the Greeks was resumed in this astonishing\r\nrenascence of the Semitic world.  The seed of Aristotle and the museum\r\nof Alexandria that had lain so long inactive and neglected now\r\ngerminated and began to grow towards fruition.  Very great advances\r\nwere made in mathematical, medical and physical science.  The clumsy\r\nRoman numerals were ousted by the Arabic figures we use to this day and\r\nthe zero sign was first employed.  The very name algebra is Arabic.  So\r\nis the word chemistry.  The names of such stars as Algol, Aldebaran and\r\nBoötes preserve the traces of Arab conquests in the sky.  Their\r\nphilosophy was destined to reanimate the medieval philosophy of France\r\nand Italy and the whole Christian world.\r\n\r\nThe Arab experimental chemists were called alchemists, and they were\r\nstill sufficiently barbaric in spirit to keep their methods and results\r\nsecret as far as possible.  They realized from the very beginning what\r\nenormous advantages their possible discoveries might give them, and\r\nwhat far-reaching consequences they might have on human life.  They\r\ncame upon many metallurgical and technical devices of the utmost value,\r\nalloys and dyes, distilling, tinctures and essences, optical glass; but\r\nthe two chief ends they sought, they sought in vain.  One was “the\r\nphilosopher’s stone”—a means of changing the metallic elements one into\r\nanother and so getting a control of artificial gold, and the other was\r\nthe _elixir vitœ_, a stimulant that would revivify age and prolong life\r\nindefinitely.  The crabbed patient experimenting of these Arab\r\nalchemists spread into the Christian world.  The fascination of their\r\nenquiries spread.  Very gradually the activities of these alchemists\r\nbecame more social and co-operative.  They found it profitable to\r\nexchange and compare ideas.  By insensible gradations the last of the\r\nalchemists became the first of the experimental philosophers.\r\n\r\nThe old alchemists sought the philosopher’s stone which was to\r\ntransmute base metals to gold, and an elixir of immortality; they found\r\nthe methods of modern experimental science which promise in the end to\r\ngive man illimitable power over the world and over his own destiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF LATIN CHRISTENDOM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to note the extremely shrunken dimensions of the\r\nshare of the world remaining under Aryan control in the seventh and\r\neighth centuries. A thousand years before, the Aryan-speaking races\r\nwere triumphant over all the civilized world west of China. Now the\r\nMongol had thrust as far as Hungary, nothing of Asia remained under\r\nAryan rule except the Byzantine dominions in Asia Minor, and all Africa\r\nwas lost and nearly all Spain. The great Hellenic world had shrunken to\r\na few possessions round the nucleus of the trading city of\r\nConstantinople, and the memory of the Roman world was kept alive by the\r\nLatin of the western Christian priests. In vivid contrast to this tale\r\nof retrogression, the Semitic tradition had risen again from\r\nsubjugation and obscurity after a thousand years of darkness.\r\n\r\nYet the vitality of the Nordic peoples was not exhausted. Confined now\r\nto Central and North-Western Europe and terribly muddled in their\r\nsocial and political ideas, they were nevertheless building up\r\ngradually and steadily a new social order and preparing unconsciously\r\nfor the recovery of a power even more extensive than that they had\r\npreviously enjoyed.\r\n\r\nWe have told how at the beginning of the sixth century there remained\r\nno central government in Western Europe at all. That world was divided\r\nup among numbers of local rulers holding their own as they could.  This\r\nwas too insecure a state of affairs to last; a system of co-operation\r\nand association grew up in this disorder, the feudal system, which has\r\nleft its traces upon European life up to the present time.  This feudal\r\nsystem was a sort of crystallization of society about power. \r\nEverywhere the lone man felt insecure and was prepared to barter a\r\ncertain amount of his liberty for help and protection.  He sought a\r\nstronger man as his lord and protector; he gave him military services\r\nand paid him dues, and in return he was confirmed in his possession of\r\nwhat was his.  His lord again found safety in vassalage to a still\r\ngreater lord.  Cities also found it convenient to have feudal\r\nprotectors, and monasteries and church estates bound themselves by\r\nsimilar ties.  No doubt in many cases allegiance was claimed before it\r\nwas offered; the system grew downward as well as upward.  So a sort of\r\npyramidal system grew up, varying widely in different localities,\r\npermitting at first a considerable play of violence and private warfare\r\nbut making steadily for order and a new reign of law.  The pyramids\r\ngrew up until some became recognizable as kingdoms.  Already by the\r\nearly sixth century a Frankish kingdom existed under its founder Clovis\r\nin what is now France and the Netherlands, and presently Visigothic and\r\nLombard and Gothic kingdoms were in existence.\r\n\r\nThe Moslim when they crossed the Pyrenees in 720 found this Frankish\r\nkingdom under the practical rule of Charles Martel, the Mayor of the\r\nPalace of a degenerate descendant of Clovis, and experienced the\r\ndecisive defeat of Poitiers (732) at his hands.  This Charles Martel\r\nwas practically overlord of Europe north of the Alps from the Pyrenees\r\nto Hungary.  He ruled over a multitude of subordinate lords speaking\r\nFrench- Latin, and High and Low German languages.  His son Pepin\r\nextinguished the last descendants of Clovis and took the kingly state\r\nand title.  His grandson Charlemagne, who began to reign in 768, found\r\nhimself lord of a realm so large that he could think of reviving the\r\ntitle of Latin Emperor.  He conquered North Italy and made himself\r\nmaster of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: Area more or less under Frankish dominion in the time of Charles\r\nMartel\r\n\r\nApproaching the story of Europe as we do from the wider horizons of a\r\nworld history we can see much more distinctly than the mere nationalist\r\nhistorian how cramping and disastrous this tradition of the Latin Roman\r\nEmpire was.  A narrow intense struggle for this phantom predominance\r\nwas to consume European energy for more than a thousand years. Through\r\nall that period it is possible to trace certain unquenchable\r\nantagonisms; they run through the wits of Europe like the obsessions of\r\na demented mind.  One driving force was this ambition of successful\r\nrulers, which Charlemagne (Charles the Great) embodied, to become\r\nCæsar.  The realm of Charlemagne consisted of a complex of feudal\r\nGerman states at various stages of barbarism.  West of the Rhine, most\r\nof these German peoples had learnt to speak various Latinized dialects\r\nwhich fused at last to form French.  East of the Rhine, the racially\r\nsimilar German peoples did not lose their German speech.  On account of\r\nthis, communication was difficult between these two groups of barbarian\r\nconquerors and a split easily brought about.  The split was made the\r\nmore easy by the fact that the Frankish usage made it seem natural to\r\ndivide the empire of Charlemagne among his sons at his death.  So one\r\naspect of the history of Europe from the days of Charlemagne onwards is\r\na history of first this monarch and his family and then that,\r\nstruggling to a precarious headship of the kings, princes, dukes,\r\nbishops and cities of Europe, while a steadily deepening antagonism\r\nbetween the French and German speaking elements develops in the medley.\r\n There was a formality of election for each emperor; and the climax of\r\nhis ambition was to struggle to the possession of that worn-out,\r\nmisplaced capital Rome and to a coronation there.\r\n\r\nThe next factor in the European political disorder was the resolve of\r\nthe Church at Rome to make no temporal prince but the Pope of Rome\r\nhimself emperor in effect.  He was already pontifex maximus; for all\r\npractical purposes he held the decaying city; if he had no armies he\r\nhad at least a vast propaganda organization in his priests throughout\r\nthe whole Latin world; if he had little power over men’s bodies he held\r\nthe keys of heaven and hell in their imaginations and could exercise\r\nmuch influence upon their souls.  So throughout the middle ages while\r\none prince manœuvred against another first for equality, then for\r\nascendancy, and at last for the supreme prize, the Pope of Rome,\r\nsometimes boldly, sometimes craftily, sometimes feebly—for the Popes\r\nwere a succession of oldish men and the average reign of a Pope was not\r\nmore than two years—manœuvred for the submission of all the princes to\r\nhimself as the ultimate overlord of Christendom.\r\n\r\nBut these antagonisms of prince against prince and of Emperor against\r\nPope do not by any means exhaust the factors of the European confusion.\r\n There was still an Emperor in Constantinople speaking Greek and\r\nclaiming the allegiance of all Europe.  When Charlemagne sought to\r\nrevive the empire, it was merely the Latin end of the empire he\r\nrevived.  It was natural that a sense of rivalry between Latin Empire\r\nand Greek Empire should develop very readily.  And still more readily\r\ndid the rivalry of Greek-speaking Christianity and the newer\r\nLatin-speaking version develop.  The Pope of Rome claimed to be the\r\nsuccessor of St. Peter, the chief of the apostles of Christ, and the\r\nhead of the Christian community everywhere.  Neither the emperor nor\r\nthe patriarch in Constantinople were disposed to acknowledge this\r\nclaim.  A dispute about a fine point in the doctrine of the Holy\r\nTrinity consummated a long series of dissensions in a final rupture in\r\n1054.  The Latin Church and the Greek Church became and remained\r\nthereafter distinct and frankly antagonistic. This antagonism must be\r\nadded to the others in our estimate of the conflicts that wasted Latin\r\nChristendom in the middle ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATUE OF CHARLEMAGNE IN FRONT OF NOTRE DAME, PARIS\r\nSTATUE OF CHARLEMAGNE IN FRONT OF NOTRE DAME, PARIS\r\nThe figure is entirely imaginary and romantic.  There is no\r\ncontemporary portrait of Charlemagne\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Rischgitz_\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon this divided world of Christendom rained the blows of three sets\r\nof antagonists.  About the Baltic and North Seas remained a series of\r\nNordic tribes who were only very slowly and reluctantly Christianized;\r\nthese were the Northmen.  They had taken to the sea and piracy, and\r\nwere raiding all the Christian coasts down to Spain.  They had pushed\r\nup the Russian rivers to the desolate central lands and brought their\r\nshipping over into the south-flowing rivers.  They had come out upon\r\nthe Caspian and Black Seas as pirates also.  They set up principalities\r\nin Russia; they were the first people to be called Russians.  These\r\nNorthmen Russians came near to taking Constantinople.  England in the\r\nearly ninth century was a Christianized Low German country under a\r\nking, Egbert, a protégé and pupil of Charlemagne.  The Northmen wrested\r\nhalf the kingdom from his successor Alfred the Great (886), and finally\r\nunder Canute (1016) made themselves masters of the whole land.  Under\r\nRolph the Ganger (912) another band of Northmen conquered the north of\r\nFrance, which became Normandy.\r\n\r\nCanute ruled not only over England but over Norway and Denmark, but his\r\nbrief empire fell to pieces at his death through that political\r\nweakness of the barbaric peoples—division among a ruler’s sons.  It is\r\ninteresting to speculate what might have happened if this temporary\r\nunion of the Northmen had endured.  They were a race of astonishing\r\nboldness and energy.  They sailed in their galleys even to Iceland and\r\nGreenland.  They were the first Europeans to land on American soil. \r\nLater on Norman adventurers were to recover Sicily from the Saracens\r\nand sack Rome.  It is a fascinating thing to imagine what a great\r\nnorthern sea-faring power might have grown out of Canute’s kingdom,\r\nreaching from America to Russia.\r\n\r\nTo the east of the Germans and Latinized Europeans was a medley of Slav\r\ntribes and Turkish peoples.  Prominent among these were the Magyars or\r\nHungarians who were coming westward throughout the eighth and ninth\r\ncenturies.  Charlemagne held them for a time, but after his death they\r\nestablished themselves in what is now Hungary; and after the fashion of\r\ntheir kindred predecessors, the Huns, raided every summer into the\r\nsettled parts of Europe.  In 938 they went through Germany into France,\r\ncrossed the Alps into North Italy, and so came home, burning, robbing\r\nand destroying.\r\n\r\nFinally pounding away from the south at the vestiges of the Roman\r\nEmpire were the Saracens.  They had made themselves largely masters of\r\nthe sea; their only formidable adversaries upon the water were the\r\nNorthmen, the Russian Northmen out of the Black Sea and the Northmen of\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: Europe at the death of Charlemagne—814\r\n\r\nHemmed in by these more vigorous and aggressive peoples, amidst forces\r\nthey did not understand and dangers they could not estimate,\r\nCharlemagne and after him a series of other ambitious spirits took up\r\nthe futile drama of restoring the Western Empire under the name of the\r\nHoly Roman Empire.  From the time of Charlemagne onward this idea\r\nobsessed the political life of Western Europe, while in the East the\r\nGreek half of the Roman power decayed and dwindled until at last\r\nnothing remained of it at all but the corrupt trading city of\r\nConstantinople and a few miles of territory about it. Politically the\r\ncontinent of Europe remained traditional and uncreative from the time\r\nof Charlemagne onward for a thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe name of Charlemagne looms large in European history but his\r\npersonality is but indistinctly seen.  He could not read nor write, but\r\nhe had a considerable respect for learning; he liked to be read aloud\r\nto at meals and he had a weakness for theological discussion.  At his\r\nwinter quarters at Aix-la- Chapelle or Mayence he gathered about him a\r\nnumber of learned men and picked up much from their conversation.  In\r\nthe summer he made war, against the Spanish Saracens, against the Slavs\r\nand Magyars, against the Saxons, and other still heathen German tribes.\r\n It is doubtful whether the idea of becoming Cæsar in succession to\r\nRomulus Augustulus occurred to him before his acquisition of North\r\nItaly, or whether it was suggested to him by Pope Leo III, who was\r\nanxious to make the Latin Church independent of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThere were the most extraordinary manœuvres at Rome between the Pope\r\nand the prospective emperor in order to make it appear or not appear as\r\nif the Pope gave him the imperial crown.  The Pope succeeded in\r\ncrowning his visitor and conqueror by surprise in St. Peter’s on\r\nChristmas Day 800 A.D.  He produced a crown, put it on the head of\r\nCharlemagne and hailed him Cæsar and Augustus.  There was great\r\napplause among the people. Charlemagne was by no means pleased at the\r\nway in which the thing was done, it rankled in his mind as a defeat;\r\nand he left the most careful instructions to his son that he was not to\r\nlet the Pope crown him emperor; he was to seize the crown into his own\r\nhands and put it on his own head himself.  So at the very outset of\r\nthis imperial revival we see beginning the age-long dispute of Pope and\r\nEmperor for priority.  But Louis the Pious, the son of Charlemagne,\r\ndisregarded his father’s instructions and was entirely submissive to\r\nthe Pope.\r\n\r\nThe empire of Charlemagne fell apart at the death of Louis the Pious\r\nand the split between the French-speaking Franks and the\r\nGerman-speaking Franks widened.  The next emperor to arise was Otto,\r\nthe son of a certain Henry the Fowler, a Saxon, who had been elected\r\nKing of Germany by an assembly of German princes and prelates in 919. \r\nOtto descended upon Rome and was crowned emperor there in 962.  This\r\nSaxon line came to an end early in the eleventh century and gave place\r\nto other German rulers.  The feudal princes and nobles to the west who\r\nspoke various French dialects did not fall under the sway of these\r\nGerman emperors after the Carlovingian line, the line that is descended\r\nfrom Charlemagne, had come to an end, and no part of Britain ever came\r\ninto the Holy Roman Empire.  The Duke of Normandy, the King of France\r\nand a number of lesser feudal rulers remained outside.  In 987 the\r\nKingdom of France passed out of the possession of the Carlovingian line\r\ninto the hands of Hugh Capet, whose descendants were still reigning in\r\nthe eighteenth century.  At the time of Hugh Capet the King of France\r\nruled only a comparatively small territory round Paris.\r\n\r\nIn 1066 England was attacked almost simultaneously by an invasion of\r\nthe Norwegian Northmen under King Harold Hardrada and by the Latinized\r\nNorthmen under the Duke of Normandy. Harold King of England defeated\r\nthe former at the battle of Stamford Bridge, and was defeated by the\r\nlatter at Hastings. England was conquered by the Normans, and so cut\r\noff from Scandinavian, Teutonic and Russian affairs, and brought into\r\nthe most intimate relations and conflicts with the French. For the next\r\nfour centuries the English were entangled in the conflicts of the\r\nFrench feudal princes and wasted upon the fields of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI\r\nTHE CRUSADES AND THE AGE OF PAPAL DOMINION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that Charlemagne corresponded with the Caliph\r\nHaroun-al-Raschid, the Haroun-al-Raschid of the _Arabian Nights_. It is\r\nrecorded that Haroun-al-Raschid sent ambassadors from Bagdad—which had\r\nnow replaced Damascus as the Moslem capital—with a splendid tent, a\r\nwater clock, an elephant and the keys of the Holy Sepulchre. This\r\nlatter present was admirably calculated to set the Byzantine Empire and\r\nthis new Holy Roman Empire by the ears as to which was the proper\r\nprotector of the Christians in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThese presents remind us that while Europe in the ninth century was\r\nstill a weltering disorder of war and pillage, there flourished a great\r\nArab Empire in Egypt and Mesopotamia, far more civilized than anything\r\nEurope could show.  Here literature and science still lived; the arts\r\nflourished, and the mind of man could move without fear or\r\nsuperstition.  And even in Spain and North Africa where the Saracenic\r\ndominions were falling into political confusion there was a vigorous\r\nintellectual life.  Aristotle was read and discussed by these Jews and\r\nArabs during these centuries of European darkness.  They guarded the\r\nneglected seeds of science and philosophy.\r\n\r\nNorth-east of the Caliph’s dominions was a number of Turkish tribes. \r\nThey had been converted to Islam, and they held the faith much more\r\nsimply and fiercely than the actively intellectual Arabs and Persians\r\nto the south.  In the tenth century the Turks were growing strong and\r\nvigorous while the Arab power was divided and decaying.  The relations\r\nof the Turks to the Empire of the Caliphate became very similar to the\r\nrelations of the Medes to the last Babylonian Empire fourteen centuries\r\nbefore.  In the eleventh century a group of Turkish tribes, the Seljuk\r\nTurks, came down into Mesopotamia and made the Caliph their nominal\r\nruler but really their captive and tool.  They conquered Armenia.  Then\r\nthey struck at the remnants of the Byzantine power in Asia Minor.  In\r\n1071 the Byzantine army was utterly smashed at the battle of Melasgird,\r\nand the Turks swept forward until not a trace of Byzantine rule\r\nremained in Asia. They took the fortress of Nicæa over against\r\nConstantinople, and prepared to attempt that city.\r\n\r\nThe Byzantine emperor, Michael VII, was overcome with terror. He was\r\nalready heavily engaged in warfare with a band of Norman adventurers\r\nwho had seized Durazzo, and with a fierce Turkish people, the\r\nPetschenegs, who were raiding over the Danube.  In his extremity he\r\nsought help where he could, and it is notable that he did not appeal to\r\nthe western emperor but to the Pope of Rome as the head of Latin\r\nChristendom.  He wrote to Pope Gregory VII, and his successor Alexius\r\nComnenus wrote still more urgently to Urban II.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUSADER TOMBS IN EXETER CATHEDRAL\r\nCRUSADER TOMBS IN EXETER CATHEDRAL\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Mansell_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was not a quarter of a century from the rupture of the Latin and\r\nGreek churches.  That controversy was still vividly alive in men’s\r\nminds, and this disaster to Byzantium must have presented itself to the\r\nPope as a supreme opportunity for reasserting the supremacy of the\r\nLatin Church over the dissentient Greeks.  Moreover this occasion gave\r\nthe Pope a chance to deal with two other matters that troubled western\r\nChristendom very greatly.  One was the custom of “private war” which\r\ndisordered social life, and the other was the superabundant fighting\r\nenergy of the Low Germans and Christianized Northmen and particularly\r\nof the Franks and Normans.  A religious war, the Crusade, the War of\r\nthe Cross, was preached against the Turkish captors of Jerusalem, and a\r\ntruce to all warfare amongst Christians (1095).  The declared object of\r\nthis war was the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre from the unbelievers. \r\nA man called Peter the Hermit carried on a popular propaganda\r\nthroughout France and Germany on broadly democratic lines. He went clad\r\nin a coarse garment, barefooted on an ass, he carried a huge cross and\r\nharangued the crowd in street or market-place or church.  He denounced\r\nthe cruelties practised upon the Christian pilgrims by the Turks, and\r\nthe shame of the Holy Sepulchre being in any but Christian hands.  The\r\nfruits of centuries of Christian teaching became apparent in the\r\nresponse.  A great wave of enthusiasm swept the western world, and\r\npopular Christendom discovered itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIEW OF CAIRO\r\nVIEW OF CAIRO\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Lehnert & Landrock_\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a widespread uprising of the common people in relation to a single\r\nidea as now occurred was a new thing in the history of our race.  There\r\nis nothing to parallel it in the previous history of the Roman Empire\r\nor of India or China. On a smaller scale, however, there had been\r\nsimilar movements among the Jewish people after their liberation from\r\nthe Babylonian captivity, and later on Islam was to display a parallel\r\nsusceptibility to collective feeling.  Such movements were certainly\r\nconnected with the new spirit that had come into life with the\r\ndevelopment of the missionary- teaching religions.  The Hebrew\r\nprophets, Jesus and his disciples, Mani, Muhammad, were all exhorters\r\nof men’s individual souls.  They brought the personal conscience face\r\nto face with God.  Before that time religion had been much more a\r\nbusiness of fetish, of pseudoscience, than of conscience.  The old kind\r\nof religion turned upon temple, initiated priest and mystical\r\nsacrifice, and ruled the common man like a slave by fear.  The new kind\r\nof religion made a man of him.\r\n\r\nThe preaching of the First Crusade was the first stirring of the common\r\npeople in European history.  It may be too much to call it the birth of\r\nmodern democracy, but certainly at that time modern democracy stirred. \r\nBefore very long we shall find it stirring again, and raising the most\r\ndisturbing social and religious questions.\r\n\r\nCertainly this first stirring of democracy ended very pitifully and\r\nlamentably.  Considerable bodies of common people, crowds rather than\r\narmies, set out eastward from France and the Rhineland and Central\r\nEurope without waiting for leaders or proper equipment to rescue the\r\nHoly Sepulchre. This was the “people’s crusade.”  Two great mobs\r\nblundered into Hungary, mistook the recently converted Magyars for\r\npagans, committed atrocities and were massacred. A third multitude with\r\na similarly confused mind, after a great pogrom of the Jews in the\r\nRhineland, marched eastward, and was also destroyed in Hungary.  Two\r\nother huge crowds, under the leadership of Peter the Hermit himself,\r\nreached Constantinople, crossed the Bosphorus, and were massacred\r\nrather than defeated by the Seljuk Turks.  So began and ended this\r\nfirst movement of the European people, as people.\r\n\r\nNext year (1097) the real fighting forces crossed the Bosphorus. \r\nEssentially they were Norman in leadership and spirit.  They stormed\r\nNicæa, marched by much the same route as Alexander had followed\r\nfourteen centuries before, to Antioch.  The siege of Antioch kept them\r\na year, and in June 1099 they invested Jerusalem.  It was stormed after\r\na month’s siege.  The slaughter was terrible.  Men riding on horseback\r\nwere splashed by the blood in the streets.  At nightfall on July 15th\r\nthe Crusaders had fought their way into the Church of the Holy\r\nSepulchre and overcome all opposition there: blood-stained, weary and\r\n“sobbing from excess of joy” they knelt down in prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HORSES OF S. MARK, VENICE\r\nTHE HORSES OF S. MARK, VENICE\r\nOriginally on the arch of Trajan at Constantinople, the Doge Dandalo V\r\ntook them after the Fourth Crusade, to Venice, whence Napoleon I\r\nremoved them to Paris, but in 1815 they were returned to Venice. \r\nDuring the Great War of 1914-18 they were hidden away for fear of air\r\nraids.\r\n\r\n_Photo:  D. McLeish_\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately the hostility of Latin and Greek broke out again. The\r\nCrusaders were the servants of the Latin Church, and the Greek\r\npatriarch of Jerusalem found himself in a far worse case under the\r\ntriumphant Latins than under the Turks.  The Crusaders discovered\r\nthemselves between Byzantine and Turk and fighting both.  Much of Asia\r\nMinor was recovered by the Byzantine Empire, and the Latin princes were\r\nleft, a buffer between Turk and Greek, with Jerusalem and a few small\r\nprincipalities, of which Edessa was one of the chief, in Syria.  Their\r\ngrip even on these possessions was precarious, and in 1144 Edessa fell\r\nto the Moslim, leading to an ineffective Second Crusade, which failed\r\nto recover Edessa but saved Antioch from a similar fate.\r\n\r\nIn 1169 the forces of Islam were rallied under a Kurdish adventurer\r\nnamed Saladin who had made himself master of Egypt.  He preached a Holy\r\nWar against the Christians, recaptured Jerusalem in 1187, and so\r\nprovoked the Third Crusade.  This failed to recover Jerusalem.  In the\r\nFourth Crusade (1202-4) the Latin Church turned frankly upon the Greek\r\nEmpire, and there was not even a pretence of fighting the Turks.  It\r\nstarted from Venice and in 1204 it stormed Constantinople. The great\r\nrising trading city of Venice was the leader in this adventure, and\r\nmost of the coasts and islands of the Byzantine Empire were annexed by\r\nthe Venetians.  A “Latin” emperor (Baldwin of Flanders) was set up in\r\nConstantinople and the Latin and Greek Church were declared to be\r\nreunited.  The Latin emperors ruled in Constantinople from 1204 to 1261\r\nwhen the Greek world shook itself free again from Roman predominance.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth century then and the opening of the thirteenth was the age\r\nof papal ascendancy just as the eleventh was the age of the ascendancy\r\nof the Seljuk Turks and the tenth the age of the Northmen.  A united\r\nChristendom under the rule of the Pope came nearer to being a working\r\nreality than it ever was before or after that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COURTYARD IN THE ALHAMBRA\r\nA COURTYARD IN THE ALHAMBRA\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Lehnert & Landrock_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those centuries a simple Christian faith was real and widespread\r\nover great areas of Europe.  Rome itself had passed through some dark\r\nand discreditable phases; few writers can be found to excuse the lives\r\nof Popes John XI and John XII in the tenth century; they were\r\nabominable creatures; but the heart and body of Latin Christendom had\r\nremained earnest and simple; the generality of the common priests and\r\nmonks and nuns had lived exemplary and faithful lives.  Upon the wealth\r\nof confidence such lives created rested the power of the church.  Among\r\nthe great Popes of the past had been Gregory the Great, Gregory I\r\n(590-604) and Leo III (795-816) who invited Charlemagne to be Cæsar and\r\ncrowned him in spite of himself.  Towards the close of the eleventh\r\ncentury there arose a great clerical statesman, Hildebrand, who ended\r\nhis life as Pope Gregory VII (1073- 1085).  Next but one after him came\r\nUrban II (1087-1099), the Pope of the First Crusade.  These two were\r\nthe founders of this period of papal greatness during which the Popes\r\nlorded it over the Emperors.  From Bulgaria to Ireland and from Norway\r\nto Sicily and Jerusalem the Pope was supreme.  Gregory VII obliged the\r\nEmperor Henry IV to come in penitence to him at Canossa and to await\r\nforgiveness for three days and nights in the courtyard of the castle,\r\nclad in sackcloth and barefooted to the snow.  In 1176 at Venice the\r\nEmperor Frederick (Frederick Barbarossa), knelt to Pope Alexander III\r\nand swore fealty to him.\r\n\r\nThe great power of the church in the beginning of the eleventh century\r\nlay in the wills and consciences of men.  It failed to retain the moral\r\nprestige on which its power was based.  In the opening decades of the\r\nfourteenth century it was discovered that the power of the Pope had\r\nevaporated. What was it that destroyed the naive confidence of the\r\ncommon people of Christendom in the church so that they would no longer\r\nrally to its appeal and serve its purposes?\r\n\r\nThe first trouble was certainly the accumulation of wealth by the\r\nchurch.  The church never died, and there was a frequent disposition on\r\nthe part of dying childless people to leave lands to the church. \r\nPenitent sinners were exhorted to do so.  Accordingly in many European\r\ncountries as much as a fourth of the land became church property.  The\r\nappetite for property grows with what it feeds upon.  Already in the\r\nthirteenth century it was being said everywhere that the priests were\r\nnot good men, that they were always hunting for money and legacies.\r\n\r\nThe kings and princes disliked this alienation of property very\r\ngreatly.  In the place of feudal lords capable of military support,\r\nthey found their land supporting abbeys and monks and nuns.  And these\r\nlands were really under foreign dominion.  Even before the time of Pope\r\nGregory VII there had been a struggle between the princes and the\r\npapacy over the question of “investitures,” the question that is of who\r\nshould appoint the bishops.  If that power rested with the Pope and not\r\nthe King, then the latter lost control not only of the consciences of\r\nhis subjects but of a considerable part of his dominions.  For also the\r\nclergy claimed exemption from taxation.  They paid their taxes to Rome.\r\n And not only that, but the church also claimed the right to levy a tax\r\nof one-tenth upon the property of the layman in addition to the taxes\r\nhe paid his prince.\r\n\r\nThe history of nearly every country in Latin Christendom tells of the\r\nsame phase in the eleventh century, a phase of struggle between monarch\r\nand Pope on the issue of investitures and generally it tells of a\r\nvictory for the Pope.  He claimed to be able to excommunicate the\r\nprince, to absolve his subjects from their allegiance to him, to\r\nrecognize a successor.  He claimed to be able to put a nation under an\r\ninterdict, and then nearly all priestly functions ceased except the\r\nsacraments of baptism, confirmation and penance; the priests could\r\nneither hold the ordinary services, marry people, nor bury the dead. \r\nWith these two weapons it was possible for the twelfth century Popes to\r\ncurb the most recalcitrant princes and overawe the most restive\r\npeoples.  These were enormous powers, and enormous powers are only to\r\nbe used on extraordinary occasions.  The Popes used them at last with a\r\nfrequency that staled their effect.  Within thirty years at the end of\r\nthe twelfth century we find Scotland, France and England in turn under\r\nan interdict.  And also the Popes could not resist the temptation to\r\npreach crusades against offending princes—until the crusading spirit\r\nwas extinct.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that if the Church of Rome had struggled simply against\r\nthe princes and had had a care to keep its hold upon the general mind,\r\nit might have achieved a permanent dominion over all Christendom.  But\r\nthe high claims of the Pope were reflected as arrogance in the conduct\r\nof the clergy.  Before the eleventh century the Roman priests could\r\nmarry; they had close ties with the people among whom they lived; they\r\nwere indeed a part of the people.  Gregory VII made them celibates; he\r\ncut the priests off from too great an intimacy with the laymen in order\r\nto bind them more closely to Rome, but indeed he opened a fissure\r\nbetween the church and the commonalty.  The church had its own law\r\ncourts. Cases involving not merely priests but monks, students,\r\ncrusaders, widows, orphans and the helpless were reserved for the\r\nclerical courts, and so were all matters relating to wills, marriages\r\nand oaths and all cases of sorcery, heresy and blasphemy.  Whenever the\r\nlayman found himself in conflict with the priest he had to go to a\r\nclerical court.  The obligations of peace and war fell upon his\r\nshoulders alone and left the priest free.  It is no great wonder that\r\njealousy and hatred of the priests grew up in the Christian world.\r\n\r\nNever did Rome seem to realize that its power was in the consciences of\r\ncommon men.  It fought against religious enthusiasm, which should have\r\nbeen its ally, and it forced doctrinal orthodoxy upon honest doubt and\r\naberrant opinion. When the church interfered in matters of morality it\r\nhad the common man with it, but not when it interfered in matters of\r\ndoctrine.  When in the south of France Waldo taught a return to the\r\nsimplicity of Jesus in faith and life, Innocent III preached a crusade\r\nagainst the Waldenses, Waldo’s followers, and permitted them to be\r\nsuppressed with fire, sword, rape and the most abominable cruelties. \r\nWhen again St. Francis of Assisi (1181-1226) taught the imitation of\r\nChrist and a life of poverty and service, his followers, the\r\nFranciscans, were persecuted, scourged, imprisoned and dispersed.  In\r\n1318 four of them were burnt alive at Marseilles.  On the other hand\r\nthe fiercely orthodox order of the Dominicans, founded by St. Dominic\r\n(1170-1221) was strongly supported by Innocent III, who with its\r\nassistance set up an organization, the Inquisition, for the hunting of\r\nheresy and the affliction of free thought.\r\n\r\nSo it was that the church by excessive claims, by unrighteous\r\nprivileges, and by an irrational intolerance destroyed that free faith\r\nof the common man which was the final source of all its power.  The\r\nstory of its decline tells of no adequate foemen from without but\r\ncontinually of decay from within.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII\r\nRECALCITRANT PRINCES AND THE GREAT SCHISM\r\n\r\n\r\nOne very great weakness of the Roman Church in its struggle to secure\r\nthe headship of all Christendom was the manner in which the Pope was\r\nchosen.\r\n\r\nIf indeed the papacy was to achieve its manifest ambition and establish\r\none rule and one peace throughout Christendom, then it was vitally\r\nnecessary that it should have a strong, steady and continuous\r\ndirection.  In those great days of its opportunity it needed before all\r\nthings that the Popes when they took office should be able men in the\r\nprime of life, that each should have his successor-designate with whom\r\nhe could discuss the policy of the church, and that the forms and\r\nprocesses of election should be clear, definite, unalterable and\r\nunassailable.  Unhappily none of these things obtained.  It was not\r\neven clear who could vote in the election of a Pope, nor whether the\r\nByzantine or Holy Roman Emperor had a voice in the matter.  That very\r\ngreat papal statesman Hildebrand (Pope Gregory VII, 1073-1085) did much\r\nto regularize the election.  He confined the votes to the Roman\r\ncardinals and he reduced the Emperor’s share to a formula of assent\r\nconceded to him by the church, but he made no provision for a\r\nsuccessor-designate and he left it possible for the disputes of the\r\ncardinals to keep the See vacant, as in some cases it was kept vacant,\r\nfor a year or more.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILAN CATHEDRALA COURTYARD IN THE ALHAMBRA\r\nMILAN CATHEDRALA COURTYARD IN THE ALHAMBRA\r\nView showing the exquisite carvings characteristic of the 98 spires of\r\nthe edifice\r\n\r\n\r\nThe consequences of this want of firm definition are to be seen in the\r\nwhole history of the papacy up to the sixteenth century.  From quite\r\nearly times onward there were disputed elections and two or more men\r\neach claiming to be Pope.  The church would then be subjected to the\r\nindignity of going to the Emperor or some other outside arbiter to\r\nsettle the dispute.  And the career of everyone of the great Popes\r\nended in a note of interrogation.  At his death the church might be\r\nleft headless and as ineffective as a decapitated body.  Or he might be\r\nreplaced by some old rival eager only to discredit and undo his work. \r\nOr some enfeebled old man tottering on the brink of the grave might\r\nsucceed him.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that this peculiar weakness of the papal organization\r\nshould attract the interference of the various German princes, the\r\nFrench King, and the Norman and French Kings who ruled in England; that\r\nthey should all try to influence the elections, and have a Pope in\r\ntheir own interest established in the Lateran Palace at Rome.  And the\r\nmore powerful and important the Pope became in European affairs, the\r\nmore urgent did these interventions become. Under the circumstances it\r\nis no great wonder that many of the Popes were weak and futile.  The\r\nastonishing thing is that many of them were able and courageous men.\r\n\r\nOne of the most vigorous and interesting of the Popes of this great\r\nperiod was Innocent III (1198-1216) who was so fortunate as to become\r\nPope before he was thirty-eight.  He and his successors were pitted\r\nagainst an even more interesting personality, the Emperor Frederick II;\r\n_Stupor mundi_ he was called, the Wonder of the world.  The struggle of\r\nthis monarch against Rome is a turning place in history.  In the end\r\nRome defeated him and destroyed his dynasty, but he left the prestige\r\nof the church and Pope so badly wounded that its wounds festered and\r\nled to its decay.\r\n\r\nFrederick was the son of the Emperor Henry VI and his mother was the\r\ndaughter of Roger I, the Norman King of Sicily.  He inherited this\r\nkingdom in 1198 when he was a child of four years.  Innocent III had\r\nbeen made his guardian.  Sicily in those days had been but recently\r\nconquered by the Normans; the Court was half oriental and full of\r\nhighly educated Arabs; and some of these were associated in the\r\neducation of the young king.  No doubt they were at some pains to make\r\ntheir point of view clear to him.  He got a Moslem view of Christianity\r\nas well as a Christian view of Islam, and the unhappy result of this\r\ndouble system of instruction was a view, exceptional in that age of\r\nfaith, that all religions were impostures.  He talked freely on the\r\nsubject; his heresies and blasphemies are on record.\r\n\r\nAs the young man grew up he found himself in conflict with his\r\nguardian.  Innocent III wanted altogether too much from his ward.  When\r\nthe opportunity came for Frederick to succeed as Emperor, the Pope\r\nintervened with conditions.  Frederick must promise to put down heresy\r\nin Germany with a strong hand. Moreover he must relinquish his crown in\r\nSicily and South Italy, because otherwise he would be too strong for\r\nthe Pope.  And the German clergy were to be freed from all taxation. \r\nFrederick agreed but with no intention of keeping his word.  The Pope\r\nhad already induced the French King to make war upon his own subjects\r\nin France, the cruel and bloody crusade against the Waldenses; he\r\nwanted Frederick to do the same thing in Germany.  But Frederick being\r\nfar more of a heretic than any of the simple pietists who had incurred\r\nthe Pope’s animosity, lacked the crusading impulse.  And when Innocent\r\nurged him to crusade against the Moslim and recover Jerusalem he was\r\nequally ready to promise and equally slack in his performance.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TYPICAL CRUSADER: DON RODRIGO DE CARDENAS\r\nA TYPICAL CRUSADER: DON RODRIGO DE CARDENAS\r\nFrom the Church of S. Pedro at Ocana, Spain\r\n\r\n_(In the Victoria and Albert Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving secured the imperial crown Frederick II stayed in Sicily, which\r\nhe greatly preferred to Germany as a residence, and did nothing to\r\nredeem any of his promises to Innocent III, who died baffled in 1216.\r\n\r\nHonorius III, who succeeded Innocent, could do no better with\r\nFrederick, and Gregory IX (1227) came to the papal throne evidently\r\nresolved to settle accounts with this young man at any cost.  He\r\nexcommunicated him.  Frederick II was denied all the comforts of\r\nreligion.  In the half-Arab Court of Sicily this produced singularly\r\nlittle discomfort.  And also the Pope addressed a public letter to the\r\nEmperor reciting his vices (which were indisputable), his heresies, and\r\nhis general misconduct.  To this Frederick replied in a document of\r\ndiabolical ability.  It was addressed to all the princes of Europe, and\r\nit made the first clear statement of the issue between the Pope and the\r\nprinces.  He made a shattering attack upon the manifest ambition of the\r\nPope to become the absolute ruler of all Europe.  He suggested a union\r\nof princes against this usurpation.   He directed the attention of the\r\nprinces specifically to the wealth of the church.\r\n\r\nHaving fired off this deadly missile Frederick resolved to perform his\r\ntwelve-year-old promise and go upon a crusade. This was the Sixth\r\nCrusade (1228).  It was as a crusade, farcical.  Frederick II went to\r\nEgypt and met and discussed affairs with the Sultan.  These two\r\ngentlemen, both of sceptical opinions, exchanged congenial views, made\r\na commercial convention to their mutual advantage, and agreed to\r\ntransfer Jerusalem to Frederick.  This indeed was a new sort of\r\ncrusade, a crusade by private treaty.  Here was no blood splashing the\r\nconqueror, no “weeping with excess of joy.”  As this astonishing\r\ncrusader was an excommunicated man, he had to be content with a purely\r\nsecular coronation as King of Jerusalem, taking the crown from the\r\naltar with his own hand—for all the clergy were bound to shun him.  He\r\nthen returned to Italy, chased the papal armies which had invaded his\r\ndominions back to their own territories, and obliged the Pope to grant\r\nhim absolution from his excommunication.  So a prince might treat the\r\nPope in the thirteenth century, and there was now no storm of popular\r\nindignation to avenge him.  Those days were past.\r\n\r\nIn 1239 Gregory IX resumed his struggle with Frederick, excommunicated\r\nhim for a second time, and renewed that warfare of public abuse in\r\nwhich the papacy had already suffered severely.  The controversy was\r\nrevived after Gregory IX was dead, when Innocent IV was Pope; and again\r\na devastating letter, which men were bound to remember, was written by\r\nFrederick against the church.  He denounced the pride and irreligion of\r\nthe clergy, and ascribed all the corruptions of the time to their pride\r\nand wealth.  He proposed to his fellow princes a general confiscation\r\nof church property—for the good of the church.  It was a suggestion\r\nthat never afterwards left the imagination of the European princes.\r\n\r\nWe will not go on to tell of his last years.  The particular events of\r\nhis life are far less significant than its general atmosphere.  It is\r\npossible to piece together something of his court life in Sicily.  He\r\nwas luxurious in his way of living, and fond of beautiful things.  He\r\nis described as licentious.  But it is clear that he was a man of very\r\neffectual curiosity and inquiry.  He gathered Jewish and Moslem as well\r\nas Christian philosophers at his court, and he did much to irrigate the\r\nItalian mind with Saracenic influences.  Through him the Arabic\r\nnumerals and algebra were introduced to Christian students, and among\r\nother philosophers at his court was Michael Scott, who translated\r\nportions of Aristotle and the commentaries thereon of the great Arab\r\nphilosopher Averroes (of Cordoba).  In 1224 Frederick founded the\r\nUniversity of Naples, and he enlarged and enriched the great medical\r\nschool at Salerno University. He also founded a zoological garden.  He\r\nleft a book on hawking, which shows him to have been an acute observer\r\nof the habits of birds, and he was one of the first Italians to write\r\nItalian verse.  Italian poetry was indeed born at his court.  He has\r\nbeen called by an able writer, “the first of the moderns,” and the\r\nphrase expresses aptly the unprejudiced detachment of his intellectual\r\nside.\r\n\r\nA still more striking intimation of the decay of the living and\r\nsustaining forces of the papacy appeared when presently the Popes came\r\ninto conflict with the growing power of the French King.  During the\r\nlifetime of the Emperor Frederick II, Germany fell into disunion, and\r\nthe French King began to play the rôle of guard, supporter and rival to\r\nthe Pope that had hitherto fallen to the Hohenstaufen Emperors.  A\r\nseries of Popes pursued the policy of supporting the French monarchs. \r\nFrench princes were established in the kingdom of Sicily and Naples,\r\nwith the support and approval of Rome, and the French Kings saw before\r\nthem the possibility of restoring and ruling the Empire of Charlemagne.\r\n When, however, the German interregnum after the death of Frederick II,\r\nthe last of the Hohenstaufens, came to all end and Rudolf of Habsburg\r\nwas elected first Habsburg Emperor (1273), the policy of Rome began to\r\nfluctuate between France and Germany, veering about with the sympathies\r\nof each successive Pope.  In the East in 1261 the Greeks recaptured\r\nConstantinople from the Latin emperors, and the founder of the new\r\nGreek dynasty, Michael Palæologus, Michael VIII, after some unreal\r\ntentatives of reconciliation with the Pope, broke away from the Roman\r\ncommunion altogether, and with that, and the fall of the Latin kingdoms\r\nin Asia, the eastward ascendancy of the Popes came to an end.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSTUMES OF THE BURGUNDIAN NOBILITY: FLEMISH WORK OF THE FIFTEENTH\r\nCENTURY\r\nCOSTUMES OF THE BURGUNDIAN NOBILITY: FLEMISH WORK OF THE FIFTEENTH\r\nCENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1294 Boniface VIII became Pope.  He was an Italian, hostile to the\r\nFrench, and full of a sense of the great traditions and mission of\r\nRome.  For a time he carried things with a high hand.  In 1300 he held\r\na jubilee, and a vast multitude of pilgrims assembled in Rome.  “So\r\ngreat was the influx of money into the papal treasury, that two\r\nassistants were kept busy with the rakes collecting the offerings that\r\nwere deposited at the tomb of St. Peter.” [1] But this festival was a\r\ndelusive triumph.  Boniface came into conflict with the French King in\r\n1302, and in 1303, as he was about to pronounce sentence of\r\nexcommunication against that monarch, he was surprised and arrested in\r\nhis own ancestral palace at Anagni, by Guillaume de Nogaret.  This\r\nagent from the French King forced an entrance into the palace, made his\r\nway into the bedroom of the frightened Pope—he was lying in bed with a\r\ncross in his hands—and heaped threats and insults upon him.  The Pope\r\nwas liberated a day or so later by the townspeople, and returned to\r\nRome; but there he was seized upon and again made prisoner by the\r\nOrsini family, and in a few weeks’ time the shocked and disillusioned\r\nold man died a prisoner in their hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSTUMES OF THE BURGUNDIAN NOBILITY: FLEMISH WORK OF THE FIFTEENTH\r\nCENTURY\r\nCOSTUMES OF THE BURGUNDIAN NOBILITY: FLEMISH WORK OF THE FIFTEENTH\r\nCENTURY\r\nThis series is from casts in the Victoria and Albert Museum of the\r\noriginal brass statuettes in the Rijks Museum, Amsterdam\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Anagni did resent the first outrage, and rose against\r\nNogaret to liberate Boniface, but then Anagni was the Pope’s native\r\ntown.  The important point to note is that the French King in this\r\nrough treatment of the head of Christendom was acting with the full\r\napproval of his people; he had summoned a council of the Three Estates\r\nof France (lords, church and commons) and gained their consent before\r\nproceeding to extremities.  Neither in Italy, Germany nor England was\r\nthere the slightest general manifestation of disapproval at this free\r\nhandling of the sovereign pontiff. The idea of Christendom had decayed\r\nuntil its power over the minds of men had gone.\r\n\r\nThroughout the fourteenth century the papacy did nothing to recover its\r\nmoral sway.  The next Pope elected, Clement V, was a Frenchman, the\r\nchoice of King Philip of France.  He never came to Rome.  He set up his\r\ncourt in the town of Avignon, which then belonged not to France but to\r\nthe papal See, though embedded in French territory, and there his\r\nsuccessors remained until 1377, when Pope Gregory XI returned to the\r\nVatican palace in Rome.  But Gregory XI did not take the sympathies of\r\nthe whole church with him.  Many of the cardinals were of French origin\r\nand their habits and associations were rooted deep at Avignon.  When in\r\n1378 Gregory XI died, and an Italian, Urban VI, was elected, these\r\ndissentient cardinals declared the election invalid, and elected\r\nanother Pope, the anti-Pope, Clement VII.  This split is called the\r\nGreat Schism.  The Popes remained in Rome, and all the anti-French\r\npowers, the Emperor, the King of England, Hungary, Poland and the North\r\nof Europe were loyal to them. The anti-Popes, on the other hand,\r\ncontinued in Avignon, and were supported by the King of France, his\r\nally the King of Scotland, Spain, Portugal and various German princes. \r\nEach Pope excommunicated and cursed the adherents of his rival\r\n(1378-1417).\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder that presently all over Europe people began to think\r\nfor themselves in matters of religion?\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of the Franciscans and the Dominicans, which we have\r\nnoted in the preceding chapters, were but two among many of the new\r\nforces that were arising in Christendom, either to hold or shatter the\r\nchurch as its own wisdom might decide. Those two orders the church did\r\nassimilate and use, though with a little violence in the case of the\r\nformer.  But other forces were more frankly disobedient and critical. \r\nA century and a half later came Wycliffe (1320-1384). He was a learned\r\nDoctor at Oxford.  Quite late in his life he began a series of\r\noutspoken criticisms of the corruption of the clergy and the unwisdom\r\nof the church.  He organized a number of poor priests, the Wycliffites,\r\nto spread his ideas throughout England; and in order that people should\r\njudge between the church and himself, he translated the Bible into\r\nEnglish.  He was a more learned and far abler man than either St.\r\nFrancis or St. Dominic.  He had supporters in high places and a great\r\nfollowing among the people; and though Rome raged against him, and\r\nordered his imprisonment, he died a free man.  But the black and\r\nancient spirit that was leading the Catholic Church to its destruction\r\nwould not let his bones rest in the grave.  By a decree of the Council\r\nof Constance in 1415, his remains were ordered to be dug up and burnt,\r\nan order which was carried out at the command of Pope Martin V by\r\nBishop Fleming in 1428.  This desecration was not the act of some\r\nisolated fanatic; it was the official act of the church.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] J. H. Robinson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII\r\nTHE MONGOL CONQUESTS\r\n\r\n\r\nBut in the thirteenth century, while this strange and finally\r\nineffectual struggle to unify Christendom under the rule of the Pope\r\nwas going on in Europe, far more momentous events were afoot upon the\r\nlarger stage of Asia. A Turkish people from the country to the north of\r\nChina rose suddenly to prominence in the world’s affairs, and achieved\r\nsuch a series of conquests as has no parallel in history. These were\r\nthe Mongols. At the opening of the thirteenth century they were a horde\r\nof nomadic horsemen, living very much as their predecessors, the Huns,\r\nhad done, subsisting chiefly upon meat and mare’s milk and living in\r\ntents of skin. They had shaken themselves free from Chinese dominion,\r\nand brought a number of other Turkish tribes into a military\r\nconfederacy. Their central camp was at Karakorum in Mongolia.\r\n\r\nAt this time China was in a state of division.  The great dynasty of\r\nTang had passed into decay by the tenth century, and after a phase of\r\ndivision into warring states, three main empires, that of Kin in the\r\nnorth with Pekin as its capital and that of Sung in the south with a\r\ncapital at Nankin, and Hsia in the centre, remain.  In 1214 Jengis\r\nKhan, the leader of the Mongol confederates, made war on the Kin Empire\r\nand captured Pekin (1214).  He then turned westward and conquered\r\nWestern Turkestan, Persia, Armenia, India down to Lahore, and South\r\nRussia as far as Kieff.  He died master of a vast empire that reached\r\nfrom the Pacific to the Dnieper.\r\n\r\nHis successor, Ogdai Khan, continued this astonishing career of\r\nconquest.  His armies were organized to a very high level of\r\nefficiency; and they had with them a new Chinese invention, gunpowder,\r\nwhich they used in small field guns. He completed the conquest of the\r\nKin Empire and then swept his hosts right across Asia to Russia (1235),\r\nan altogether amazing march.  Kieff was destroyed in 1240, and nearly\r\nall Russia became tributary to the Mongols.  Poland was ravaged, and a\r\nmixed army of Poles and Germans was annihilated at the battle of\r\nLiegnitz in Lower Silesia in 1241.  The Emperor Frederick II does not\r\nseem to have made any great efforts to stay the advancing tide.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: The Ottoman Empire before 1453\r\n\r\n“It is only recently,” says Bury in his notes to Gibbon’s _Decline and\r\nFall of the Roman Empire_, “that European history has begun to\r\nunderstand that the successes of the Mongol army which overran Poland\r\nand occupied Hungary in the spring of A.D. 1241 were won by consummate\r\nstrategy and were not due to a mere overwhelming superiority of\r\nnumbers.  But this fact has not yet become a matter of common\r\nknowledge; the vulgar opinion which represents the Tartars as a wild\r\nhorde carrying all before them solely by their multitude, and galloping\r\nthrough Eastern Europe without a strategic plan, rushing at all\r\nobstacles and overcoming them by mere weight, still prevails. . . .\r\n\r\n“It was wonderful how punctually and effectually the arrangements were\r\ncarried out in operations extending from the Lower Vistula to\r\nTransylvania.  Such a campaign was quite beyond the power of any\r\nEuropean army of the time, and it was beyond the vision of any European\r\ncommander. There was no general in Europe, from Frederick II downward,\r\nwho was not a tyro in strategy compared to Subutai.  It should also be\r\nnoticed that the Mongols embarked upon the enterprise with full\r\nknowledge of the political situation of Hungary and the condition of\r\nPoland—they had taken care to inform themselves by a well-organized\r\nsystem of spies; on the other hand, the Hungarians and the Christian\r\npowers, like childish barbarians, knew hardly anything about their\r\nenemies.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: The Empire of Jengis Khan at his death (1227)\r\n\r\nBut though the Mongols were victorious at Liegnitz, they did not\r\ncontinue their drive westward.  They were getting into woodlands and\r\nhilly country, which did not suit their tactics; and so they turned\r\nsouthward and prepared to settle in Hungary, massacring or assimilating\r\nthe kindred Magyar, even as these had previously massacred and\r\nassimilated the mixed Scythians and Avars and Huns before them.  From\r\nthe Hungarian plain they would probably have made raids west and south\r\nas the Hungarians had done in the ninth century, the Avars in the\r\nseventh and eighth and the Huns in the fifth. But Ogdai died suddenly,\r\nand in 1242 there was trouble about the succession, and recalled by\r\nthis, the undefeated hosts of Mongols began to pour back across Hungary\r\nand Roumania towards the east.\r\n\r\nThereafter the Mongols concentrated their attention upon their Asiatic\r\nconquests.  By the middle of the thirteenth century they had conquered\r\nthe Sung Empire.  Mangu Khan succeeded Ogdai Khan as Great Khan in\r\n1251, and made his brother Kublai Khan governor of China.  In 1280\r\nKublai Khan had been formally recognized Emperor of China, and so\r\nfounded the Yuan dynasty which lasted until 1368.  While the last ruins\r\nof the Sung rule were going down in China, another brother of Mangu,\r\nHulagu, was conquering Persia and Syria. The Mongols displayed a bitter\r\nanimosity to Islam at this time, and not only massacred the population\r\nof Bagdad when they captured that city, but set to work to destroy the\r\nimmemorial irrigation system which had kept Mesopotamia incessantly\r\nprosperous and populous from the early days of Sumeria.  From that time\r\nuntil our own Mesopotamia has been a desert of ruins, sustaining only a\r\nscanty population.  Into Egypt the Mongols never penetrated; the Sultan\r\nof Egypt completely defeated an army of Hulagu’s in Palestine in 1260.\r\n\r\nAfter that disaster the tide of Mongol victory ebbed.  The dominions of\r\nthe Great Khan fell into a number of separate states.  The eastern\r\nMongols became Buddhists, like the Chinese; the western became Moslim. \r\nThe Chinese threw off the rule of the Yuan dynasty in 1368, and set up\r\nthe native Ming dynasty which flourished from 1368 to 1644.  The\r\nRussians remained tributary to the Tartar hordes upon the south-east\r\nsteppes until 1480, when the Grand Duke of Moscow repudiated his\r\nallegiance and laid the foundation of modern Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTARTAR HORSEMEN\r\nTARTAR HORSEMEN\r\n_(From a Chinese Print in the British Museum) _\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century there was a brief revival of Mongol vigour\r\nunder Timurlane, a descendant of Jengis Khan.  He established himself\r\nin Western Turkestan, assumed the title of Grand Khan in 1369, and\r\nconquered from Syria to Delhi.  He was the most savage and destructive\r\nof all the Mongol conquerors.  He established an empire of desolation\r\nthat did not survive his death.  In 1505, however, a descendant of this\r\nTimur, an adventurer named Baber, got together an army with guns and\r\nswept down upon the plains of India.  His grandson Akbar (1556-1605)\r\ncompleted his conquests, and this Mongol (or “Mogul” as the Arabs\r\ncalled it) dynasty ruled in Delhi over the greater part of India until\r\nthe eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: The Ottoman Empire at the death of Suleiman the Magnificent, 1566\r\nA.D.\r\n\r\nOne of the consequences of the first great sweep of Mongol conquest in\r\nthe thirteenth century was to drive a certain tribe of Turks, the\r\nOttoman Turks, out of Turkestan into Asia Minor.  They extended and\r\nconsolidated their power in Asia Minor, crossed the Dardanelles and\r\nconquered Macedonia, Serbia and Bulgaria, until at last Constantinople\r\nremained like an island amongst the Ottoman dominions.  In 1453 the\r\nOttoman Sultan, Muhammad II, took Constantinople, attacking it from the\r\nEuropean side with a great number of guns.  This event caused intense\r\nexcitement in Europe and there was talk of a crusade, but the day of\r\nthe crusades was past.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the sixteenth century the Ottoman Sultans conquered\r\nBagdad, Hungary, Egypt and most of North Africa, and their fleet made\r\nthem masters of the Mediterranean.  They very nearly took Vienna, and\r\nthey exacted it tribute from the Emperor.  There were but two items to\r\noffset the general ebb of Christian dominion in the fifteenth century. \r\nOne was the restoration of the independence of Moscow (1480); the other\r\nwas the gradual reconquest of Spain by the Christians. In 1492,\r\nGranada, the last Moslem state in the peninsula, fell to King Ferdinand\r\nof Aragon and his Queen Isabella of Castile.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until as late as 1571 that the naval battle of Lepanto\r\nbroke the prick of the Ottomans, and restored the Mediterranean waters\r\nto Christian ascendancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX\r\nTHE INTELLECTUAL REVIVAL OF THE EUROPEANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the twelfth century there were many signs that the European\r\nintelligence was recovering courage and leisure, and preparing to take\r\nup again the intellectual enterprises of the first Greek scientific\r\nenquiries and such speculations as those of the Italian Lucretius. The\r\ncauses of this revival were many and complex. The suppression of\r\nprivate war, the higher standards of comfort and security that followed\r\nthe crusades, and the stimulation of men’s minds by the experiences of\r\nthese expeditions were no doubt necessary preliminary conditions. Trade\r\nwas reviving; cities were recovering ease and safety; the standard of\r\neducation was arising in the church and spreading among laymen. The\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries were a period of growing,\r\nindependent or quasi-independent cities; Venice, Florence, Genoa,\r\nLisbon, Paris, Bruges, London, Antwerp, Hamburg, Nuremberg, Novgorod,\r\nWisby and Bergen for example. They were all trading cities with many\r\ntravellers, and where men trade and travel they talk and think. The\r\npolemics of the Popes and princes, the conspicuous savagery and\r\nwickedness of the persecution of heretics, were exciting men to doubt\r\nthe authority of the church and question and discuss fundamental\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the Arabs were the means of restoring Aristotle to\r\nEurope, and how such a prince as Frederick II acted as a channel\r\nthrough which Arabic philosophy and science played upon the renascent\r\nEuropean mind.  Still more influential in the stirring up of men’s\r\nideas were the Jews.  Their very existence was a note of interrogation\r\nto the claims of the church.  And finally the secret, fascinating\r\nenquiries of the alchemists were spreading far and wide and setting men\r\nto the petty, furtive and yet fruitful resumption of experimental\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nAnd the stir in men’s minds was by no means confined now to the\r\nindependent and well educated.  The mind of the common man was awake in\r\nthe world as it had never been before in all the experience of mankind.\r\n In spite of priest and persecution, Christianity does seem to have\r\ncarried a mental ferment wherever its teaching reached.  It established\r\na direct relation between the conscience of the individual man and the\r\nGod of Righteousness, so that now if need arose he had the courage to\r\nform his own judgment upon prince or prelate or creed.\r\n\r\nAs early as the eleventh century philosophical discussion had begun\r\nagain in Europe, and there were great and growing universities at\r\nParis, Oxford, Bologna and other centres. There medieval “schoolmen”\r\ntook up again and thrashed out a series of questions upon the value and\r\nmeaning of words that were a necessary preliminary to clear thinking in\r\nthe scientific age that was to follow.  And standing by himself because\r\nof his distinctive genius was Roger Bacon (circa 1210 to circa 1293), a\r\nFranciscan of Oxford, the father of modern experimental science.  His\r\nname deserves a prominence in our history second only to that of\r\nAristotle.\r\n\r\nHis writings are one long tirade against ignorance.  He told his age it\r\nwas ignorant, an incredibly bold thing to do. Nowadays a man may tell\r\nthe world it is as silly as it is solemn, that all its methods are\r\nstill infantile and clumsy and its dogmas childish assumptions, without\r\nmuch physical danger; but these peoples of the middle ages when they\r\nwere not actually being massacred or starving or dying of pestilence,\r\nwere passionately convinced of the wisdom, the completeness and\r\nfinality of their beliefs, and disposed to resent any reflections upon\r\nthem very bitterly.  Roger Bacon’s writings were like a flash of light\r\nin a profound darkness.  He combined his attack upon the ignorance of\r\nhis times with a wealth of suggestion for the increase of knowledge. \r\nIn his passionate insistence upon the need of experiment and of\r\ncollecting knowledge, the spirit of Aristotle lives again in him. \r\n“Experiment, experiment,” that is the burthen of Roger Bacon.\r\n\r\nYet of Aristotle himself Roger Bacon fell foul.  He fell foul of him\r\nbecause men, instead of facing facts boldly, sat in rooms and pored\r\nover the bad Latin translations which were then all that was available\r\nof the master. “If I had my way,” he wrote, in his intemperate fashion,\r\n“I should burn all the books of Aristotle, for the study of them can\r\nonly lead to a loss of time, produce error, and increase ignorance,” a\r\nsentiment that Aristotle would probably have echoed could he have\r\nreturned to a world in which his works were not so much read as\r\nworshipped—and that, as Roger Bacon showed, in these most abominable\r\ntranslations.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EARLY PRINTING PRESS\r\nAN EARLY PRINTING PRESS\r\n_(From an old print) _\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout his books, a little disguised by the necessity of seeming to\r\nsquare it all with orthodoxy for fear of the prison and worse, Roger\r\nBacon shouted to mankind, “Cease to be ruled by dogmas and authorities;\r\n_look at the world!_” Four chief sources of ignorance he denounced;\r\nrespect for authority, custom, the sense of the ignorant crowd, and the\r\nvain, proud unteachableness of our dispositions.  Overcome but these,\r\nand a world of power would open to men: —\r\n\r\n“Machines for navigating are possible without rowers, so that great\r\nships suited to river or ocean, guided by one man, may be borne with\r\ngreater speed than if they were full of men.  Likewise cars may be made\r\nso that without a draught animal they may be moved _cum impetu\r\ninœstimable_, as we deem the scythed chariots to have been from which\r\nantiquity fought.  And flying machines are possible, so that a man may\r\nsit in the middle turning some device by which artificial wings may\r\nbeat the air in the manner of a flying bird.”\r\n\r\nSo Roger Bacon wrote, but three more centuries were to elapse before\r\nmen began any systematic attempts to explore the hidden stores of power\r\nand interest he realized so clearly existed beneath the dull surface of\r\nhuman affairs.\r\n\r\nBut the Saracenic world not only gave Christendom the stimulus of its\r\nphilosophers and alchemists; it also gave it paper.  It is scarcely too\r\nmuch to say that paper made the intellectual revival of Europe\r\npossible.  Paper originated in China, where its use probably goes back\r\nto the second century B.C.  In 751 the Chinese made an attack upon the\r\nArab Moslems in Samarkand; they were repulsed, and among the prisoners\r\ntaken from them were some skilled papermakers, from whom the art was\r\nlearnt.  Arabic paper manuscripts from the ninth century onward still\r\nexist. The manufacture entered Christendom either through Greece or by\r\nthe capture of Moorish paper-mills during the Christian reconquest of\r\nSpain.  But under the Christian Spanish the product deteriorated sadly.\r\n Good paper was not made in Christian Europe until the end of the\r\nthirteenth century, and then it was Italy which led the world.  Only by\r\nthe fourteenth century did the manufacture reach Germany, and not until\r\nthe end of that century was it abundant and cheap enough for the\r\nprinting of books to be a practicable business proposition.  Thereupon\r\nprinting followed naturally and necessarily, for printing is the most\r\nobvious of inventions, and the intellectual life of the world entered\r\nupon a new and far more vigorous phase.  It ceased to be a little\r\ntrickle from mind to mind; it became a broad flood, in which thousands\r\nand presently scores and hundreds of thousands of minds participated.\r\n\r\nOne immediate result of this achievement of printing was the appearance\r\nof an abundance of Bibles in the world.  Another was a cheapening of\r\nschool-books.  The knowledge of reading spread swiftly.  There was not\r\nonly a great increase of books in the world, but the books that were\r\nnow made were plainer to read and so easier to understand.  Instead of\r\ntoiling at a crabbed text arid then thinking over its significance,\r\nreaders now could think unimpeded as they read.  With this increase in\r\nthe facility of reading, the reading public grew. The book ceased to be\r\na highly decorated toy or a scholar’s mystery.  People began to write\r\nbooks to be read as well as looked at by ordinary people.  They wrote\r\nin the ordinary language and not in Latin.  With the fourteenth century\r\nthe real history of the European literature begins.\r\n\r\nSo far we have been dealing only with the Saracenic share in the\r\nEuropean revival.  Let us turn now to the influence of the Mongol\r\nconquests.  They stimulated the geographical imagination of Europe\r\nenormously.  For a time under the Great Khan, all Asia and Western\r\nEurope enjoyed an open intercourse; all the roads were temporarily\r\nopen, and representatives of every nation appeared at the court of\r\nKarakorum.  The barriers between Europe and Asia set up by the\r\nreligious feud of Christianity and Islam were lowered. Great hopes were\r\nentertained by the papacy for the conversion of the Mongols to\r\nChristianity.  Their only religion so far had been Shumanism, a\r\nprimitive paganism.  Envoys of the Pope, Buddhist priests from India,\r\nParisian and Italian and Chinese artificers, Byzantine and Armenian\r\nmerchants, mingled with Arab officials and Persian and Indian\r\nastronomers and mathematicians at the Mongol court.  We hear too much\r\nin history of the campaigns and massacres of the Mongols, and not\r\nenough of their curiosity and desire for learning.  Not perhaps as an\r\noriginative people, but as transmitters of knowledge and method their\r\ninfluence upon the world’s history has been very great.  And everything\r\none can learn of the vague and romantic personalities of Jengis or\r\nKublai tends to confirm the impression that these men were at least as\r\nunderstanding and creative monarchs as either that flamboyant but\r\negotistical figure Alexander the Great or that raiser of political\r\nghosts, that energetic but illiterate theologian Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of these visitors to the Mongol Court was a\r\ncertain Venetian, Marco Polo, who afterwards set down his story in a\r\nbook.  He went to China about 1272 with his father and uncle, who had\r\nalready once made the journey. The Great Khan had been deeply impressed\r\nby the elder Polos; they were the first men of the “Latin” peoples he\r\nhad seen; and he sent them back with enquiries for teachers and learned\r\nmen who could explain Christianity to him, and for various other\r\nEuropean things that had aroused his curiosity.  Their visit with Marco\r\nwas their second visit.\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT BRONZE FIGURE FROM BENIN, W. AFRICA\r\nANCIENT BRONZE FIGURE FROM BENIN, W. AFRICA\r\nNote evidence in attire of knowledge of early European explorers\r\n\r\n_(In the British Museum) _\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three Polos started by way of Palestine and not by the Crimea, as\r\nin their previous expedition.  They had with them a gold tablet and\r\nother indications from the Great Khan that must have greatly\r\nfacilitated their journey.  The Great Khan had asked for some oil from\r\nthe lamp that burns in the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem; and so thither\r\nthey first went, and then by way of Cilicia into Armenia.  They went\r\nthus far north because the Sultan of Egypt was raiding the Mongol\r\ndomains at this time.  Thence they came by way of Mesopotamia to Ormuz\r\non the Persian Gulf, as if they contemplated a sea voyage.  At Ormuz\r\nthey met merchants from India.  For some reason they did not take ship,\r\nbut instead turned northward through the Persian deserts, and so by way\r\nof Balkh over the Pamir to Kashgar, and by way of Kotan and the Lob Nor\r\ninto the Hwang-ho valley and on to Pekin.  At Pekin was the Great Khan,\r\nand they were hospitably entertained.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER ANCIENT NEGRO BRONZE OF A EUROPEAN\r\nANOTHER ANCIENT NEGRO BRONZE OF A EUROPEAN\r\n\r\n_(In the British Museum) _\r\n\r\n\r\nMarco particularly pleased Kublai; he was young and clever, and it is\r\nclear he had mastered the Tartar language very thoroughly.  He was\r\ngiven an official position and sent on several missions, chiefly in\r\nsouth-west China.  The tale he had to tell of vast stretches of smiling\r\nand prosperous country, “all the way excellent hostelries for\r\ntravellers,” and “fine vineyards, fields, and gardens,” of “many\r\nabbeys” of Buddhist monks, of manufactures of “cloth of silk and gold\r\nand many fine taffetas,” a “constant succession of cities and\r\nboroughs,” and so on, first roused the incredulity and then fired the\r\nimagination of all Europe.  He told of Burmah, and of its great armies\r\nwith hundreds of elephants, and how these animals were defeated by the\r\nMongol bowmen, and also of the Mongol conquest of Pegu.  He told of\r\nJapan, and greatly exaggerated the amount of gold in that country.  For\r\nthree years Marco ruled the city of Yang-chow as governor, and he\r\nprobably impressed the Chinese inhabitants as being little more of a\r\nforeigner than any Tartar would have been.  He may also have been sent\r\non a mission to India.  Chinese records mention a certain Polo attached\r\nto the imperial council in 1277, a very valuable confirmation of the\r\ngeneral truth of the Polo story.\r\n\r\nThe publication of Marco Polo’s travels produced a profound effect upon\r\nthe European imagination.  The European literature, and especially the\r\nEuropean romance of the fifteenth century, echoes with the names in\r\nMarco Polo’s story, with Cathay (North China) and Cambulac (Pekin) and\r\nthe like.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY ITALIAN ENGRAVING OF A SAILING SHIP\r\nEARLY ITALIAN ENGRAVING OF A SAILING SHIP\r\n\r\n_(In the British Museum) _\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo centuries later, among the readers of the Travels of Marco Polo was\r\na certain Genoese mariner, Christopher Columbus, who conceived the\r\nbrilliant idea of sailing westward round the world to China.  In\r\nSeville there is a copy of the Travels with marginal notes by Columbus.\r\nThere were many reasons why the thought of a Genoese should be turned\r\nin this direction.  Until its capture by the Turks in 1453\r\nConstantinople had been an impartial trading mart between the Western\r\nworld and the East, and the Genoese had traded there freely.  But the\r\n“Latin” Venetians, the bitter rivals of the Genoese, had been the\r\nallies and helpers of the Turks against the Greeks, and with the coming\r\nof the Turks Constantinople turned an unfriendly face upon Genoese\r\ntrade.  The long forgotten discovery that the world was round had\r\ngradually resumed its sway over men’s minds.  The idea of going\r\nwestward to China was therefore a fairly obvious one.  It was\r\nencouraged by two things.  The mariner’s compass had now been invented\r\nand men were no longer left to the mercy of a fine night and the stars\r\nto determine the direction in which they were sailing, and the Normans,\r\nCatalonians and Genoese and Portuguese had already pushed out into the\r\nAtlantic as far as the Canary Isles, Madeira and the Azores.\r\n\r\nYet Columbus found many difficulties before he could get ships to put\r\nhis idea to the test.  He went from one European Court to another. \r\nFinally at Granada, just won from the Moors, he secured the patronage\r\nof Ferdinand and Isabella, and was able to set out across the unknown\r\nocean in three small ships.  After a voyage of two months and nine days\r\nhe came to a land which he believed to be India, but which was really a\r\nnew continent, whose distinct existence the old world had never\r\nhitherto suspected.  He returned to Spain with gold, cotton, strange\r\nbeasts and birds, and two wild- eyed painted Indians to be baptized. \r\nThey were called Indians because, to the end of his days, he believed\r\nthat this land he had found was India.  Only in the course of several\r\nyears did men begin to realize that the whole new continent of America\r\nwas added to the world’s resources.\r\n\r\nThe success of Columbus stimulated overseas enterprise enormously.  In\r\n1497 the Portuguese sailed round Africa to India, and in 1515 there\r\nwere Portuguese ships in Java.  In 1519 Magellan, a Portuguese sailor\r\nin Spanish employment, sailed out of Seville westward with five ships,\r\nof which one, the _Vittoria_, came back up the river to Seville in\r\n1522, the first ship that had ever circumnavigated the world.\r\nThirty-one men were aboard her, survivors of two-hundred-and- eighty\r\nwho had started.  Magellan himself had been killed in the Philippine\r\nIsles.\r\n\r\nPrinted paper books, a new realization of the round world as a thing\r\naltogether attainable, a new vision of strange lands, strange animals\r\nand plants, strange manners and customs, discoveries overseas and in\r\nthe skies and in the ways and materials of life burst upon the European\r\nmind. The Greek classics, buried and forgotten for so long, were\r\nspeedily being printed and studied, and were colouring men’s thoughts\r\nwith the dreams of Plato and the traditions of an age of republican\r\nfreedom and dignity.  The Roman dominion had first brought law and\r\norder to Western Europe, and the Latin Church had restored it; but\r\nunder both Pagan and Catholic Rome curiosity and innovation were\r\nsubordinate to and restrained by organization.  The reign of the Latin\r\nmind was now drawing to an end.  Between the thirteenth and the\r\nsixteenth century the European Aryans, thanks to the stimulating\r\ninfluence of Semite and Mongol and the rediscovery of the Greek\r\nclassics, broke away from the Latin tradition and rose again to the\r\nintellectual and material leadership of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL\r\nTHE REFORMATION OF THE LATIN CHURCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Latin Church itself was enormously affected by this mental rebirth.\r\nIt was dismembered; and even the portion that survived was extensively\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\nWe have told how nearly the church came to the autocratic leadership of\r\nall Christendom in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and how in the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth its power over men’s minds and affairs\r\ndeclined.  We have described how popular religious enthusiasm which had\r\nin earlier ages been its support and power was turned against it by its\r\npride, persecutions and centralization, and how the insidious\r\nscepticism of Frederick II bore fruit in a growing insubordination of\r\nthe princes.  The Great Schism had reduced its religious and political\r\nprestige to negligible proportions.  The forces of insurrection struck\r\nit now from both sides.\r\n\r\nThe teachings of the Englishman Wycliffe spread widely throughout\r\nEurope.  In 1398 a learned Czech, John Huss, delivered a series of\r\nlectures upon Wycliffe’s teachings in the university of Prague.  This\r\nteaching spread rapidly beyond the educated class and aroused great\r\npopular enthusiasm.  In 1414-18 a Council of the whole church was held\r\nat Constance to settle the Great Schism.  Huss was invited to this\r\nCouncil under promise of a safe conduct from the emperor, seized, put\r\non trial for heresy and burnt alive (1415).  So far from tranquillizing\r\nthe Bohemian people, this led to an insurrection of the Hussites in\r\nthat country, the first of a series of religious wars that inaugurated\r\nthe break-up of Latin Christendom.  Against this insurrection Pope\r\nMartin V, the Pope specially elected at Constance as the head of a\r\nreunited Christendom, preached a Crusade.\r\n\r\nFive Crusades in all were launched upon this sturdy little people and\r\nall of them failed.  All the unemployed ruffianism of Europe was turned\r\nupon Bohemia in the fifteenth century, just as in the thirteenth it had\r\nbeen turned upon the Waldenses.  But the Bohemian Czechs, unlike the\r\nWaldenses, believed in armed resistance.  The Bohemian Crusade\r\ndissolved and streamed away from the battlefield at the sound of the\r\nHussites’ waggons and the distant chanting of their troops; it did not\r\neven wait to fight (battle of Domazlice, 1431).  In 1436 an agreement\r\nwas patched up with the Hussites by a new Council of the church at\r\nBasle in which many of the special objections to Latin practice were\r\nconceded.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF LUTHER\r\nPORTRAIT OF LUTHER\r\n\r\n_(From an early German engraving in the British Museum) _\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century a great pestilence had produced much social\r\ndisorganization throughout Europe.  There had been extreme misery and\r\ndiscontent among the common people, and peasant risings against the\r\nlandlords and the wealthy in England and France.  After the Hussite\r\nWars these peasant insurrections increased in gravity in Germany and\r\ntook on a religious character.  Printing came in as an influence upon\r\nthis development.  By the middle of the fifteenth century there were\r\nprinters at work with movable type in Holland and the Rhineland.  The\r\nart spread to Italy and England, where Caxton was printing in\r\nWestminster in 1477.  The immediate consequence was a great increase\r\nand distribution of Bibles, and greatly increased facilities for\r\nwidespread popular controversies.  The European world became a world of\r\nreaders, to an extent that had never happened to any community in the\r\npast.  And this sudden irrigation of the general mind with clearer\r\nideas and more accessible information occurred just at a time when the\r\nchurch was confused and divided and not in a position to defend itself\r\neffectively, and when many princes were looking for means to weaken its\r\nhold upon the vast wealth it claimed in their dominions.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the attack upon the church gathered round the personality of\r\nan ex-monk, Martin Luther (1483-1546), who appeared in Wittenberg in\r\n1517 offering disputations against various orthodox doctrines and\r\npractices.  At first he disputed in Latin in the fashion of the\r\nSchoolmen.  Then he took up the new weapon of the printed word and\r\nscattered his views far and wide in German addressed to the ordinary\r\npeople.  An attempt was made to suppress him as Huss had been\r\nsuppressed, but the printing press had changed conditions and he had\r\ntoo many open and secret friends among the German princes for this fate\r\nto overtake him.\r\n\r\nFor now in this age of multiplying ideas and weakened faith there were\r\nmany rulers who saw their advantage in breaking the religious ties\r\nbetween their people and Rome.  They sought to make themselves in\r\nperson the heads of a more nationalized religion.  England, Scotland,\r\nSweden, Norway, Denmark, North Germany and Bohemia, one after another,\r\nseparated themselves from the Roman Communion.  They have remained\r\nseparated ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAJOLICA DISH PAINTED IN COLOURS\r\nA MAJOLICA DISH PAINED IN COLOURS\r\nAn allegory of the Church triumphant over heretics and infidels. \r\nItalian (Urbino), dated 1543\r\n\r\n_(In the Victoria and Albert Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe various princes concerned cared very little for the moral and\r\nintellectual freedom of their subjects.  They used the religious doubts\r\nand insurgence of their peoples to strengthen them against Rome, but\r\nthey tried to keep a grip upon the popular movement as soon as that\r\nrupture was achieved and a national church set up under the control of\r\nthe crown.  But there has always been a curious vitality in the\r\nteaching of Jesus, a direct appeal to righteousness and a man’s\r\nself-respect over every loyalty and every subordination, lay or\r\necclesiastical.  None of these princely churches broke off without also\r\nbreaking off a number of fragmentary sects that would admit the\r\nintervention of neither prince nor Pope between a man and his God.  In\r\nEngland and Scotland, for example, there was a number of sects who now\r\nheld firmly to the Bible as their one guide in life and belief.  They\r\nrefused the disciplines of a state church.  In England these\r\ndissentients were the Non- conformists, who played a very large part in\r\nthe polities of that country in the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies.  In England they carried their objection to a princely head\r\nto the church so far as to decapitate King Charles I (1649), and for\r\neleven prosperous years England was a republic under Non- conformist\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nThe breaking away of this large section of Northern Europe from Latin\r\nChristendom is what is generally spoken of as the Reformation.  But the\r\nshock and stress of these losses produced changes perhaps as profound\r\nin the Roman Church itself.  The church was reorganized and a new\r\nspirit came into its life.  One of the dominant figures in this revival\r\nwas a young Spanish soldier, Inigo Lopez de Recalde, better known to\r\nthe world as St. Ignatius of Loyola.  After some romantic beginnings he\r\nbecame a priest (1538) and was permitted to found the Society of Jesus,\r\na direct attempt to bring the generous and chivalrous traditions of\r\nmilitary discipline into the service of religion.  This Society of\r\nJesus, the Jesuits, became one of the greatest teaching and missionary\r\nsocieties the world has ever seen.  It carried Christianity to India,\r\nChina and America.  It arrested the rapid disintegration of the Roman\r\nChurch.  It raised the standard of education throughout the whole\r\nCatholic world; it raised the level of Catholic intelligence and\r\nquickened the Catholic conscience everywhere; it stimulated Protestant\r\nEurope to competitive educational efforts.  The vigorous and aggressive\r\nRoman Catholic Church we know to-day is largely the product of this\r\nJesuit revival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLI\r\nTHE EMPEROR CHARLES V\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Holy Roman Empire came to a sort of climax in the reign of the\r\nEmperor Charles V. He was one of the most extraordinary monarchs that\r\nEurope has ever seen. For a time he had the air of being the greatest\r\nmonarch since Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nHis greatness was not of his own making.  It was largely the creation\r\nof his grandfather, the Emperor Maximilian I (1459- 1519).  Some\r\nfamilies have fought, others have intrigued their way to world power;\r\nthe Habsburgs married their way. Maximilian began his career with\r\nAustria, Styria, part of Alsace and other districts, the original\r\nHabsburg patrimony; he married—the lady’s name scarcely matters to\r\nus—the Netherlands and Burgundy.  Most of Burgundy slipped from him\r\nafter his first wife’s death, but the Netherlands he held.  Then he\r\ntried unsuccessfully to marry Brittany.  He became Emperor in\r\nsuccession to his father, Frederick III, in 1493, and married the duchy\r\nof Milan. Finally he married his son to the weak-minded daughter of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, the Ferdinand and Isabella of Columbus, who not\r\nonly reigned over a freshly united Spain and over Sardinia and the\r\nkingdom of the two Sicilies, but over all America west of Brazil.  So\r\nit was that this Charles V, his grandson, inherited most of the\r\nAmerican continent and between a third and a half of what the Turks had\r\nleft of Europe.  He succeeded to the Netherlands in 1506.  When his\r\ngrandfather Ferdinand died in 1516, he became practically king of the\r\nSpanish dominions, his mother being imbecile; and his grandfather\r\nMaximilian dying in 1519, he was in 1520 elected Emperor at the still\r\ncomparatively tender age of twenty.\r\n\r\nHe was a fair young man with a not very intelligent face, a thick upper\r\nlip and a long clumsy chin.  He found himself in a world of young and\r\nvigorous personalities.  It was an age of brilliant young monarchs. \r\nFrancis I had succeeded to the French throne in 1515 at the age of\r\ntwenty-one, Henry VIII had become King of England in 1509 at eighteen. \r\nIt was the age of Baber in India (1526-1530) and Suleiman the\r\nMagnificent in Turkey (1520), both exceptionally capable monarchs, and\r\nthe Pope Leo X (1513) was also a very distinguished Pope.  The Pope and\r\nFrancis I attempted to prevent the election of Charles as Emperor\r\nbecause they dreaded the concentration of so much power in the hands of\r\none man.  Both Francis I and Henry VIII offered themselves to the\r\nimperial electors.  But there was now a long established tradition of\r\nHabsburg Emperors (since 1273), and some energetic bribery secured the\r\nelection for Charles.\r\n\r\nAt first the young man was very much a magnificent puppet in the hands\r\nof his ministers.  Then slowly he began to assert himself and take\r\ncontrol.  He began to realize something of the threatening complexities\r\nof his exalted position.  It was a position as unsound as it was\r\nsplendid.\r\n\r\nFrom the very outset of his reign he was faced by the situation created\r\nby Luther’s agitations in Germany. The Emperor had one reason for\r\nsiding with the reformers in the opposition of the Pope to his\r\nelection.  But he had been brought up in Spain, that most Catholic of\r\ncountries, and he decided against Luther.  So he came into conflict\r\nwith the Protestant princes and particularly the Elector of Saxony. He\r\nfound himself in the presence of an opening rift that was to split the\r\noutworn fabric of Christendom into two contending camps.  His attempts\r\nto close that rift were strenuous and honest and ineffective.  There\r\nwas an extensive peasant revolt in Germany which interwove with the\r\ngeneral political and religious disturbance.  And these internal\r\ntroubles were complicated by attacks upon the Empire from east and west\r\nalike.  On the west of Charles was his spirited rival, Francis I; to\r\nthe east was the ever advancing Turk, who was now in Hungary, in\r\nalliance with Francis and clamouring for certain arrears of tribute\r\nfrom the Austrian dominions.  Charles had the money and army of Spain\r\nat his disposal, but it was extremely difficult to get any effective\r\nsupport in money from Germany.  His social and political troubles were\r\ncomplicated by financial distresses.  He was forced to ruinous\r\nborrowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARLES V PORTRAIT BY TITIAN\r\nTHE CHARLES V PORTRAIT BY TITIAN\r\n\r\n_(In the Gallery del Prado, Madrid)\r\n\r\nPhoto:  Anderson_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Charles, in alliance with Henry VIII, was successful\r\nagainst Francis I and the Turk.  Their chief battlefield was North\r\nItaly; the generalship was dull on both sides; their advances and\r\nretreats depended mainly on the arrival of reinforcements.  The German\r\narmy invaded France, failed to take Marseilles, fell back into Italy,\r\nlost Milan, and was besieged in Pavia.  Francis I made a long and\r\nunsuccessful siege of Pavia, was caught by fresh German forces,\r\ndefeated, wounded and taken prisoner.  But thereupon the Pope and Henry\r\nVIII, still haunted by the fear of his attaining excessive power,\r\nturned against Charles.  The German troops in Milan, under the\r\nConstable of Bourbon, being unpaid, forced rather than followed their\r\ncommander into a raid upon Rome.  They stormed the city and pillaged it\r\n(1527).  The Pope took refuge in the Castle of St. Angelo while the\r\nlooting and slaughter went on.  He bought off the German troops at last\r\nby the payment of four hundred thousand ducats.  Ten years of such\r\nconfused fighting impoverished all Europe.  At last the Emperor found\r\nhimself triumphant in Italy.  In 1530, he was crowned by the Pope—he\r\nwas the last German Emperor to be so crowned—at Bologna.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Turks were making great headway in Hungary. They had\r\ndefeated and killed the king of Hungary in 1526, they held Buda-Pesth,\r\nand in 1529 Suleiman the Magnificent very nearly took Vienna.  The\r\nEmperor was greatly concerned by these advances, and did his utmost to\r\ndrive back the Turks, but he found the greatest difficulty in getting\r\nthe German princes to unite even with this formidable enemy upon their\r\nvery borders.  Francis I remained implacable for a time, and there was\r\na new French war; but in 1538 Charles won his rival over to a more\r\nfriendly attitude after ravaging the south of France.  Francis and\r\nCharles then formed an alliance against the Turk.  But the Protestant\r\nprinces, the German princes who were resolved to break away from Rome,\r\nhad formed a league, the Schmalkaldic League, against the Emperor, and\r\nin the place of a great campaign to recover Hungary for Christendom\r\nCharles had to turn his mind to the gathering internal struggle in\r\nGermany.  Of that struggle he saw only the opening war.  It was a\r\nstruggle, a sanguinary irrational bickering of princes, for ascendancy,\r\nnow flaming into war and destruction, now sinking back to intrigues and\r\ndiplomacies; it was a snake’s sack of princely policies that was to go\r\non writhing incurably right into the nineteenth century and to waste\r\nand desolate Central Europe again and again.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor never seems to have grasped the true forces at work in\r\nthese gathering troubles.  He was for his time and station an\r\nexceptionally worthy man, and he seems to have taken the religious\r\ndissensions that were tearing Europe into warring fragments as genuine\r\ntheological differences.  He gathered diets and councils in futile\r\nattempts at reconciliation.  Formulæ and confessions were tried over. \r\nThe student of German history must struggle with the details of the\r\nReligious Peace of Nuremberg, the settlement at the Diet of Ratisbon,\r\nthe Interim of Augsburg, and the like.  Here we do but mention them as\r\ndetails in the worried life of this culminating Emperor.  As a matter\r\nof fact, hardly one of the multifarious princes and rulers in Europe\r\nseems to have been acting in good faith.  The widespread religious\r\ntrouble of the world, the desire of the common people for truth and\r\nsocial righteousness, the spreading knowledge of the time, all those\r\nthings were merely counters in the imaginations of princely diplomacy. \r\nHenry VIII of England, who had begun his career with a book against\r\nheresy, and who had been rewarded by the Pope with the title of\r\n“Defender of the Faith,” being anxious to divorce his first wife in\r\nfavour of a young lady named Anne Boleyn, and wishing also to loot the\r\nvast wealth of the church in England, joined the company of Protestant\r\nprinces in 1530. Sweden, Denmark and Norway had already gone over to\r\nthe Protestant side.\r\n\r\nThe German religious war began in 1546, a few months after the death of\r\nMartin Luther.  We need not trouble about the incidents of the\r\ncampaign.  The Protestant Saxon army was badly beaten at Lochau.  By\r\nsomething very like a breach of faith Philip of Hesse, the Emperor’s\r\nchief remaining antagonist, was caught and imprisoned, and the Turks\r\nwere bought off by the promise of an annual tribute.  In 1547, to the\r\ngreat relief of the Emperor, Francis I died.  So by 1547 Charles got to\r\na kind of settlement, and made his last efforts to effect peace where\r\nthere was no peace.  In 1552 all Germany was at war again, only a\r\nprecipitate flight from Innsbruck saved Charles from capture, and in\r\n1552, with the treaty of Passau, came another unstable equilibrium ....\r\n\r\nSuch is the brief outline of the politics of the Empire for thirty-two\r\nyears.  It is interesting to note how entirely the European mind was\r\nconcentrated upon the struggle for European ascendancy.  Neither Turks,\r\nFrench, English nor Germans had yet discovered any political interest\r\nin the great continent of America, nor any significance in the new sea\r\nroutes to Asia.  Great things were happening in America; Cortez with a\r\nmere handful of men had conquered the great Neolithic empire of Mexico\r\nfor Spain, Pizarro had crossed the Isthmus of Panama (1530) and\r\nsubjugated another wonder-land, Peru.  But as yet these events meant no\r\nmore to Europe than a useful and stimulating influx of silver to the\r\nSpanish treasury.\r\n\r\nIt was after the treaty of Passau that Charles began to display his\r\ndistinctive originality of mind.  He was now entirely bored and\r\ndisillusioned by his imperial greatness. A sense of the intolerable\r\nfutility of these European rivalries came upon him.  He had never been\r\nof a very sound constitution, he was naturally indolent and he was\r\nsuffering greatly from gout.  He abdicated.  He made over all his\r\nsovereign rights in Germany to his brother Ferdinand, and Spain and the\r\nNetherlands he resigned to his son Philip. Then in a sort of\r\nmagnificent dudgeon he retired to a monastery at Yuste, among the oak\r\nand chestnut forests in the hills to the north of the Tagus valley. \r\nThere he died in 1558.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written in a sentimental vein of this retirement, this\r\nrenunciation of the world by this tired majestic Titan, world-weary,\r\nseeking in an austere solitude his peace with God.  But his retreat was\r\nneither solitary nor austere; he had with him nearly a hundred and\r\nfifty attendants: his establishment had all the splendour and\r\nindulgences without the fatigues or a court, and Philip II was a\r\ndutiful son to whom his father’s advice was a command.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERIOR OF ST.

PETER’S, ROME, SHOWING THE HIGH ALTAR\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Alinari_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd if Charles had lost his living interest in the administration of\r\nEuropean affairs, there were other motives of a more immediate sort to\r\nstir him.  Says Prescott: “In the almost daily correspondence between\r\nQuixada, or Gaztelu, and the Secretary of State at Valladolid, there is\r\nscarcely a letter that does not turn more or less on the Emperor’s\r\neating or his illness.  The one seems naturally to follow, like a\r\nrunning commentary, on the other.  It is rare that such topics have\r\nformed the burden of communications with the department of state.  It\r\nmust have been no easy matter for the secretary to preserve his gravity\r\nin the perusal of despatches in which politics and gastronomy were so\r\nstrangely mixed together.  The courier from Valladolid to Lisbon was\r\nordered to make a detour, so as to take Jarandilla in his route, and\r\nbring supplies to the royal table.  On Thursdays he was to bring fish\r\nto serve for the jour maigre that was to follow.  The trout in the\r\nneighbourhood Charles thought too small, so others of a larger size\r\nwere to be sent from Valladolid.  Fish of every kind was to his taste,\r\nas, indeed, was anything that in its nature or habits at all approached\r\nto fish.  Eels, frogs, oysters, occupied an important place in the\r\nroyal bill of fare.  Potted fish, especially anchovies, found great\r\nfavour with him; and he regretted that he had not brought a better\r\nsupply of these from the Low Countries.  On an eel-pasty he\r\nparticularly doted.” ... [1]\r\n\r\nIn 1554 Charles had obtained a bull from Pope Julius III granting him a\r\ndispensation from fasting, and allowing him to break his fast early in\r\nthe morning even when he was to take the sacrament.\r\n\r\nEating and doctoring! it was a return to elemental things. He had never\r\nacquired the habit of reading, but he would be read aloud to at meals\r\nafter the fashion of Charlemagne, and would make what one narrator\r\ndescribes as a “sweet and heavenly commentary.”  He also amused himself\r\nwith mechanical toys, by listening to music or sermons, and by\r\nattending to the imperial business that still came drifting in to him. \r\nThe death of the Empress, to whom he was greatly attached, had turned\r\nhis mind towards religion, which in his case took a punctilious and\r\nceremonial form; every Friday in Lent he scourged himself with the rest\r\nof the monks with such good will as to draw blood.  These exercises and\r\nthe gout released a bigotry in Charles that had hitherto been\r\nrestrained by considerations of policy.  The appearance of Protestant\r\nteaching close at hand in Valladolid roused him to fury.  “Tell the\r\ngrand inquisitor and his council from me to be at their posts, and to\r\nlay the axe at the root of the evil before it spreads further.” . .. He\r\nexpressed a doubt whether it would not be well, in so black an affair,\r\nto dispense with the ordinary course of justice, and to show no mercy;\r\n“lest the criminal, if pardoned, should have the opportunity of\r\nrepeating his crime.”  He recommended, as an example, his own mode or\r\nproceeding in the Netherlands, “where all who remained obstinate in\r\ntheir errors were burned alive, and those who were admitted to\r\npenitence were beheaded.”\r\n\r\nAnd almost symbolical of his place and role in history was his\r\npreoccupation with funerals.  He seems to have had an intuition that\r\nsomething great was dead in Europe and sorely needed burial, that there\r\nwas a need to write Finis, overdue.  He not only attended every actual\r\nfuneral that was celebrated at Yuste, but he had services conducted for\r\nthe absent dead, he held a funeral service in memory of his wife on the\r\nanniversary of her death, and finally he celebrated his own obsequies.\r\n\r\n“The chapel was hung with black, and the blaze of hundreds of\r\nwax-lights was scarcely sufficient to dispel the darkness.  The\r\nbrethren in their conventual dress, and all the Emperor’s household\r\nclad in deep mourning, gathered round a huge catafalque, shrouded also\r\nin black, which had been raised in the centre of the chapel.  The\r\nservice for the burial of the dead was then performed; and, amidst the\r\ndismal wail of the monks, the prayers ascended for the departed spirit,\r\nthat it might be received into the mansions of the blessed.  The\r\nsorrowful attendants were melted to tears, as the image of their\r\nmaster’s death was presented to their minds—or they were touched, it\r\nmay be, with compassion by this pitiable display of weakness.  Charles,\r\nmuffled in a dark mantle, and bearing a lighted candle in his hand,\r\nmingled with his household, the spectator of his own obsequies; and the\r\ndoleful ceremony was concluded by his placing the taper in the hands of\r\nthe priest, in sign of his surrendering up his soul to the Almighty.”\r\n\r\nWithin two months of this masquerade he was dead.  And the brief\r\ngreatness of the Holy Roman Empire died with him.  His realm was\r\nalready divided between his brother and his son. The Holy Roman Empire\r\nstruggled on indeed to the days of Napoleon I but as an invalid and\r\ndying thing.  To this day its unburied tradition still poisons the\r\npolitical air.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Prescott’s Appendix to Robertson’s _History of Charles V_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLII\r\nTHE AGE OF POLITICAL EXPERIMENTS; OF GRAND MONARCHY AND PARLIAMENTS AND\r\nREPUBLICANISM IN EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Latin Church was broken, the Holy Roman Empire was in extreme\r\ndecay; the history of Europe from the opening of the sixteenth century\r\nonward is a story of peoples feeling their way darkly to some new\r\nmethod of government, better adapted to the new conditions that were\r\narising. In the Ancient World, over long periods of time, there had\r\nbeen changes of dynasty and even changes of ruling race and language,\r\nbut the form of government through monarch and temple remained fairly\r\nstable, and still more stable was the ordinary way of living. In this\r\nmodern Europe since the sixteenth century the dynastic changes are\r\nunimportant, and the interest of history lies in the wide and\r\nincreasing variety of experiments in political and social organization.\r\n\r\nThe political history of the world from the sixteenth century onward\r\nwas, we have said, an effort, a largely unconscious effort, of mankind\r\nto adapt its political and social methods to certain new conditions\r\nthat had now arisen.  The effort to adapt was complicated by the fad\r\nthat the conditions themselves were changing with a steadily increasing\r\nrapidity. The adaptation, mainly unconscious and almost always\r\nunwilling (for man in general hates voluntary change), has lagged more\r\nand more behind the alterations in conditions. From the sixteenth\r\ncentury onward the history of mankind is a story of political and\r\nsocial institutions becoming more and more plainly misfits, less\r\ncomfortable and more vexatious, and of the slow reluctant realization\r\nof the need for a conscious and deliberate reconstruction of the whole\r\nscheme of human societies in the face of needs and possibilities new to\r\nall the former experiences of life.\r\n\r\nWhat are these changes in the conditions of human life that have\r\ndisorganized that balance of empire, priest, peasant and trader, with\r\nperiodic refreshment by barbaric conquest, that has held human affairs\r\nin the Old World in a sort of working rhythm for more than a hundred\r\ncenturies?\r\n\r\nThey are manifold and various, for human affairs are multitudinously\r\ncomplex; but the main changes seem all to turn upon one cause, namely\r\nthe growth and extension of a knowledge of the nature of things,\r\nbeginning first of all in small groups of intelligent people and\r\nspreading at first slowly, and in the last five hundred years very\r\nrapidly, to larger and larger proportions of the general population.\r\n\r\nBut there has also been a great change in human conditions due to a\r\nchange in the spirit of human life.  This change has gone on side by\r\nside with the increase and extension of knowledge, and is subtly\r\nconnected with it.  There has been an increasing disposition to treat a\r\nlife based on the common and more elementary desires and gratifications\r\nas unsatisfactory, and to seek relationship with and service and\r\nparticipation in a larger life.  This is the common characteristic of\r\nall the great religions that have spread throughout the world in the\r\nlast twenty odd centuries, Buddhism, Christianity and Islam alike. \r\nThey have had to do with the spirit of man in a way that the older\r\nreligions did not have to do.  They are forces quite different in their\r\nnature and effect from the old fetishistic blood-sacrifice religions of\r\npriest and temple that they have in part modified and in part replaced.\r\n They have gradually evolved a self-respect in the individual and a\r\nsense of participation and responsibility in the common concerns of\r\nmankind that did not exist among the populations of the earlier\r\ncivilizations.\r\n\r\nThe first considerable change in the conditions of political and social\r\nlife was the simplification and extended use of writing in the ancient\r\ncivilizations which made larger empires and wider political\r\nunderstandings practicable and inevitable.  The next movement forward\r\ncame with the introduction of the horse, and later on of the camel as a\r\nmeans of transport, the use of wheeled vehicles, the extension of roads\r\nand the increased military efficiency due to the discovery of\r\nterrestrial iron.  Then followed the profound economic disturbances due\r\nto the device of coined money and the change in the nature of debt,\r\nproprietorship and trade due to this convenient but dangerous\r\nconvention. The empires grew in size and range, and men’s ideas grew\r\nlikewise to correspond with these things.  Came the disappearance of\r\nlocal gods, the age of theocrasia, and the teaching of the great world\r\nreligions.  Came also the beginnings of reasoned and recorded history\r\nand geography, the first realization by man of his profound ignorance,\r\nand the first systematic search for knowledge.\r\n\r\nFor a time the scientific process which began so brilliantly in Greece\r\nand Alexandria was interrupted.  The raids of the Teutonic barbarians,\r\nthe westward drive of the Mongolian peoples, convulsive religious\r\nreconstruction and great pestilences put enormous strains upon\r\npolitical and social order.  When civilization emerged again from this\r\nphase of conflict and confusion, slavery was no longer the basis of\r\neconomic life; and the first paper-mills were preparing a new medium\r\nfor collective information and co-operation in printed matter. \r\nGradually at this point and that, the search for knowledge, the\r\nsystematic scientific process, was resumed.\r\n\r\nAnd now from the sixteenth century onward, as an inevitable by-product\r\nof systematic thought, appeared a steadily increasing series of\r\ninventions and devices affecting the intercommunication and interaction\r\nof men with one another. They all tended towards wider range of action,\r\ngreater mutual benefits or injuries, and increased co-operation, and\r\nthey came faster and faster.  Men’s minds had not been prepared for\r\nanything of the sort, and until the great catastrophes at the beginning\r\nof the twentieth century quickened men’s minds, the historian has very\r\nlittle to tell of any intelligently planned attempts to meet the new\r\nconditions this increasing flow of inventions was creating. The history\r\nof mankind for the last four centuries is rather like that of an\r\nimprisoned sleeper, stirring clumsily and uneasily while the prison\r\nthat restrains and shelters him catches fire, not waking but\r\nincorporating the crackling and warmth of the fire with ancient and\r\nincongruous dreams, than like that of a man consciously awake to danger\r\nand opportunity.\r\n\r\nSince history is the story not of individual lives but of communities,\r\nit is inevitable that the inventions that figure most in the historical\r\nrecord are inventions affecting communications.  In the sixteenth\r\ncentury the chief new things that we have to note are the appearance of\r\nprinted paper and the sea-worthy, ocean-going sailing ship using the\r\nnew device of the mariner’s compass.  The former cheapened, spread, and\r\nrevolutionized teaching, public information and discussion, and the\r\nfundamental operations of political activity.  The latter made the\r\nround world one.  But almost equally important was the increased\r\nutilization and improvement of guns and gunpowder which the Mongols had\r\nfirst brought westward in the thirteenth century.  This destroyed the\r\npractical immunity of barons in their castles and of walled cities. \r\nGuns swept away feudalism.  Constantinople fell to guns. Mexico and\r\nPeru fell before the terror of the Spanish guns.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROMWELL DISSOLVES THE LONG PARLIAMENT AND SO BECOMES AUTOCRAT OF THE\r\nENGLISH REPUBLIC\r\nCROMWELL DISSOLVES THE LONG PARLIAMENT AND SO BECOMES AUTOCRAT OF THE\r\nENGLISH REPUBLIC\r\n\r\n_(From a contemporary satirical print in the British Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century saw the development of systematic scientific\r\npublication, a less conspicuous but ultimately far more pregnant\r\ninnovation.  Conspicuous among the leaders in this great forward step\r\nwas Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626) afterwards Lord Verulam, Lord\r\nChancellor of England.  He was the pupil and perhaps the mouthpiece of\r\nanother Englishman; Dr. Gilbert, the experimental philosopher of\r\nColchester (1540-1603).  This second Bacon, like the first, preached\r\nobservation and experiment, and he used the inspiring and fruitful form\r\nof a Utopian story, _The New Atlantis_, to express his dream of a great\r\nservice of scientific research.\r\n\r\nPresently arose the Royal Society of London, the Florentine Society,\r\nand later other national bodies for the encouragement of research and\r\nthe publication and exchange of knowledge.  These European scientific\r\nsocieties became fountains not only of countless inventions but also of\r\na destructive criticism of the grotesque theological history of the\r\nworld that had dominated and crippled human thought for many centuries.\r\n\r\nNeither the seventeenth nor the eighteenth century witnessed any\r\ninnovations so immediately revolutionary in human conditions as printed\r\npaper and the ocean-going ship, but there was a steady accumulation of\r\nknowledge and scientific energy that was to bear its full fruits in the\r\nnineteenth century.  The exploration and mapping of the world went on.\r\nTasmania, Australia, New Zealand appeared on the map.  In Great Britain\r\nin the eighteenth century coal coke began to be used for metallurgical\r\npurposes, leading to a considerable cheapening of iron and to the\r\npossibility of casting and using it in larger pieces than had been\r\npossible before, when it had been smelted with wood charcoal.  Modern\r\nmachinery dawned.\r\n\r\nLike the trees of the celestial city, science bears bud and flower and\r\nfruit at the same time and continuously.  With the onset of the\r\nnineteenth century the real fruition of science—which indeed henceforth\r\nmay never cease—began.  First came steam and steel, the railway, the\r\ngreat liner, vast bridges and buildings, machinery of almost limitless\r\npower, the possibility of a bountiful satisfaction of every material\r\nhuman need, and then, still more wonderful, the hidden treasures of\r\nelectrical science were opened to men ....\r\n\r\nWe have compared the political and social life of man from the\r\nsixteenth century onward to that of a sleeping prisoner who lies and\r\ndreams while his prison burns about him.  In the sixteenth century the\r\nEuropean mind was still going on with its Latin Imperial dream, its\r\ndream of a Holy Roman Empire, united under a Catholic Church.  But just\r\nas some uncontrollable element in our composition will insist at times\r\nupon introducing into our dreams the most absurd and destructive\r\ncomments, so thrust into this dream we find the sleeping face and\r\ncraving stomach of the Emperor Charles V, while Henry VIII of England\r\nand Luther tear the unity of Catholicism to shreds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COURT AT VERSAILLES\r\nTHE COURT AT VERSAILLES\r\n\r\n_(From the print after Watteau in the British Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the dream turned to\r\npersonal monarchy.  The history of nearly all Europe during this period\r\ntells with variations the story of an attempt to consolidate a\r\nmonarchy, to make it absolute and to extend its power over weaker\r\nadjacent regions, and of the steady resistance, first of the landowners\r\nand then with the increase of foreign trade and home industry, of the\r\ngrowing trading and moneyed class, to the exaction and interference of\r\nthe crown.  There is no universal victory of either side; here it is\r\nthe King who gets the upper hand while there it is the man of private\r\nproperty who beats the King.  In one case we find a King becoming the\r\nsun and centre of his national world, while just over his borders a\r\nsturdy mercantile class maintains a republic.  So wide a range of\r\nvariation shows how entirely experimental, what local accidents, were\r\nall the various governments of this period.\r\n\r\nA very common figure in these national dramas is the King’s minister,\r\noften in the still Catholic countries a prelate, who stands behind the\r\nKing, serves him and dominates him by his indispensable services.\r\n\r\nHere in the limits set to us it is impossible to tell these various\r\nnational dramas in detail.  The trading folk of Holland went Protestant\r\nand republican, and cast off the rule of Philip II of Spain, the son of\r\nthe Emperor Charles V.  In England Henry VIII and his minister Wolsey,\r\nQueen Elizabeth and her minister Burleigh, prepared the foundations of\r\nan absolutism that was wrecked by the folly of James I and Charles I. \r\nCharles I was beheaded for treason to his people (1649), a new turn in\r\nthe political thought of Europe.  For a dozen years (until 1660)\r\nBritain was a republic; and the crown was an unstable power, much\r\novershadowed by Parliament, until George III (1760-1820) made a\r\nstrenuous and partly successful effort to restore its predominance. \r\nThe King of France, on the other hand, was the most successful of all\r\nthe European Kings in perfecting monarchy.  Two great ministers,\r\nRichelieu (1585-1642) and Mazarin (1602-1661), built up the power of\r\nthe crown in that country, and the process was aided by the long reign\r\nand very considerable abilities of King Louis XIV, “the Grand Monarque”\r\n(1643-1715).\r\n\r\nLouis XIV was indeed the pattern King of Europe.  He was, within his\r\nlimitations, an exceptionally capable King; his ambition was stronger\r\nthan his baser passions, and he guided his country towards bankruptcy\r\nthrough the complication of a spirited foreign policy with an elaborate\r\ndignity that still extorts our admiration.  His immediate desire was to\r\nconsolidate and extend France to the Rhine and Pyrenees, and to absorb\r\nthe Spanish Netherlands; his remoter view saw the French Kings as the\r\npossible successors of Charlemagne in a recast Holy Roman Empire.  He\r\nmade bribery a state method almost more important than warfare. \r\nCharles II of England was in his pay, and so were most of the Polish\r\nnobility, presently to be described.  His money, or rather the money of\r\nthe tax- paying classes in France, went everywhere.  But his prevailing\r\noccupation was splendour.  His great palace at Versailles with its\r\nsalons, its corridors, its mirrors, its terraces and fountains and\r\nparks and prospects, was the envy and admiration of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SACK OF A VILLAGE DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\nTHE SACK OF A VILLAGE DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n_(From Callot’s “Miseres de la Guerre”) _\r\n\r\n\r\nHe provoked a universal imitation.  Every king and princelet in Europe\r\nwas building his own Versailles as much beyond his means as his\r\nsubjects and credits would permit.  Everywhere the nobility rebuilt or\r\nextended their chateaux to the new pattern.  A great industry of\r\nbeautiful and elaborate fabrics and furnishings developed.  The\r\nluxurious arts flourished everywhere; sculpture in alabaster, faience,\r\ngilt woodwork, metal work, stamped leather, much music, magnificent\r\npainting, beautiful printing and bindings, fine crockery, fine\r\nvintages.  Amidst the mirrors and fine furniture went a strange race of\r\n“gentlemen” in tall powdered wigs, silks and laces, poised upon high\r\nred heels, supported by amazing canes; and still more wonderful\r\n“ladies,” under towers of powdered hair and wearing vast expansions of\r\nsilk and satin sustained on wire. Through it all postured the great\r\nLouis, the sun of his world, unaware of the meagre and sulky and bitter\r\nfaces that watched him from those lower darknesses to which his\r\nsunshine did not penetrate.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: Central Europe after the Peace of Westphalia, 1648\r\n\r\nThe German people remained politically divided throughout this period\r\nof the monarchies and experimental governments, and a considerable\r\nnumber of ducal and princely courts aped the splendours of Versailles\r\non varying scales. The Thirty Years’ War (1618-48), a devastating\r\nscramble among the Germans, Swedes and Bohemians for fluctuating\r\npolitical advantages, sapped the energies of Germany for a century.  A\r\nmap must show the crazy patchwork in which this struggle ended, a map\r\nof Europe according to the peace of Westphalia (1648).  One sees a\r\ntangle of principalities, dukedoms, free states and the like, some\r\npartly in and partly out of the Empire.  Sweden’s arm, the reader will\r\nnote, reached far into Germany; and except for a few islands of\r\nterritory within the imperial boundaries France was still far from the\r\nRhine.  Amidst this patchwork the Kingdom of Prussia—it became a\r\nKingdom in 1701—rose steadily to prominence and sustained a series of\r\nsuccessful wars. Frederick the Great of Prussia (1740-86) had his\r\nVersailles at Potsdam, where his court spoke French, read French\r\nliterature and rivalled the culture of the French King.\r\n\r\nIn 1714 the Elector of Hanover became King of England, adding one more\r\nto the list of monarchies half in and half out of the empire.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian branch of the descendants of Charles V retained the title\r\nof Emperor; the Spanish branch retained Spain.  But now there was also\r\nan Emperor of the East again.  After the fall of Constantinople (1453),\r\nthe grand duke of Moscow, Ivan the Great (1462-1505), claimed to be\r\nheir to the Byzantine throne and adopted the Byzantine double-headed\r\neagle upon his arms.  His grandson, Ivan IV, Ivan the Terrible\r\n(1533-1584), assumed the imperial title of Cæsar (Tsar).  But only in\r\nthe latter half of the seventeenth century did Russia cease to seem\r\nremote and Asiatic to the European mind.  The Tsar Peter the Great\r\n(1682-1725) brought Russia into the arena of Western affairs.  He built\r\na new capital for his empire, Petersburg upon the Neva, that played the\r\npart of a window between Russia and Europe, and he set up his\r\nVersailles at Peterhof eighteen miles away, employing a French\r\narchitect who gave him a terrace, fountains, cascades, picture gallery,\r\npark and all the recognized appointments of Grand Monarchy. In Russia\r\nas in Prussia French became the language of the court.\r\n\r\nUnhappily placed between Austria, Prussia and Russia was the Polish\r\nkingdom, an ill-organized state of great landed proprietors too jealous\r\nof their own individual grandeur to permit more than a nominal kingship\r\nto the monarch they elected.  Her fate was division among these three\r\nneighbours, in spite of the efforts of France to retain her as an\r\nindependent ally.  Switzerland at this time was a group of republican\r\ncantons; Venice was a republic; Italy like so much of Germany was\r\ndivided among minor dukes and princes.  The Pope ruled like a prince in\r\nthe papal states, too fearful now of losing the allegiance of the\r\nremaining Catholic princes to interfere between them and their subjects\r\nor to remind the world of the commonweal of Christendom. There remained\r\nindeed no common political idea in Europe at all; Europe was given over\r\naltogether to division and diversity.\r\n\r\nAll these sovereign princes and republics carried on schemes of\r\naggrandizement against each other.  Each one of them pursued a “foreign\r\npolicy” of aggression against its neighbours and of aggressive\r\nalliances.  We Europeans still live to-day in the last phase of this\r\nage of the multifarious sovereign states, and still suffer from the\r\nhatreds, hostilities and suspicions it engendered.  The history of this\r\ntime becomes more and more manifestly “gossip,” more and more unmeaning\r\nand wearisome to a modern intelligence.  You are told of how this war\r\nwas caused by this King’s mistress, and how the jealousy of one\r\nminister for another caused that.  A tittle-tattle of bribes and\r\nrivalries disgusts the intelligent student.  The more permanently\r\nsignificant fact is that in spite of the obstruction of a score of\r\nfrontiers, reading and thought still spread and increased and\r\ninventions multiplied.  The eighteenth century saw the appearance of a\r\nliterature profoundly sceptical and critical of the courts and policies\r\nof the time.  In such a book as Voltaire’s _Candide_ we have the\r\nexpression of an infinite weariness with the planless confusion of the\r\nEuropean world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIII\r\nTHE NEW EMPIRES OF THE EUROPEANS IN ASIA AND OVERSEAS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Central Europe thus remained divided and confused, the Western\r\nEuropeans and particularly the Dutch, the Scandinavians, the Spanish,\r\nthe Portuguese, the French and the British were extending the area of\r\ntheir struggles across the seas of all the world. The printing press\r\nhad dissolved the political ideas of Europe into a vast and at first\r\nindeterminate fermentation, but that other great innovation, the\r\nocean-going sailing ship, was inexorably extending the range of\r\nEuropean experience to the furthermost limits of salt water.\r\n\r\nThe first overseas settlements of the Dutch and Northern Atlantic\r\nEuropeans were not for colonization but for trade and mining.  The\r\nSpaniards were first in the field; they claimed dominion over the whole\r\nof this new world of America. Very soon however the Portuguese asked\r\nfor a share.  The Pope—it was one of the last acts of Rome as mistress\r\nof the world—divided the new continent between these two first-comers,\r\ngiving Portugal Brazil and everything else east of a line 370 leagues\r\nwest of the Cape Verde islands, and all the rest to Spain (1494).  The\r\nPortuguese at this time were also pushing overseas enterprise southward\r\nand eastward.  In 1497 Vasco da Gama had sailed from Lisbon round the\r\nCape to Zanzibar and then to Calicut in India.  In 1515 there were\r\nPortuguese ships in Java and the Moluccas, and the Portuguese were\r\nsetting up and fortifying trading stations round and about the coasts\r\nof the Indian Ocean.  Mozambique, Goa, and two smaller possessions in\r\nIndia, Macao in China and a part of Timor are to this day Portuguese\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\nThe nations excluded from America by the papal settlement paid little\r\nheed to the rights of Spain and Portugal.  The English, the Danes and\r\nSwedes, and presently the Dutch, were soon staking out claims in North\r\nAmerica and the West Indies, and his Most Catholic Majesty of France\r\nheeded the papal settlement as little as any Protestant.  The wars of\r\nEurope extended themselves to these claims and possessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: Central Europe after the Peace of Westphalia, 1648\r\n\r\nIn the long run the English were the most successful in this scramble\r\nfor overseas possessions. The Danes and Swedes were too deeply\r\nentangled in the complicated affairs of Germany to sustain effective\r\nexpeditions abroad.  Sweden was wasted upon the German battlefields by\r\na picturesque king, Gustavus Adolphus, the Protestant “Lion of the\r\nNorth.”  The Dutch were the heirs of such small settlements as Sweden\r\nmade in America, and the Dutch were too near French aggressions to hold\r\ntheir own against the British.  In the far East the chief rivals for\r\nempire were the British, Dutch and French, and in America the British,\r\nFrench and Spanish.  The British had the supreme advantage of a water\r\nfrontier, the “silver streak” of the English Channel, against Europe. \r\nThe tradition of the Latin Empire entangled them least.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPEANS TIGER HUNTING IN INDIA\r\nEUROPEANS TIGER HUNTING IN INDIA\r\n\r\n_(From the engraving of the picture by Zoffany in the British Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nFrance has always thought too much in terms of Europe. Throughout the\r\neighteenth century she was wasting her opportunities of expansion in\r\nWest and East alike in order to dominate Spain, Italy and the German\r\nconfusion.  The religious and political dissensions of Britain in the\r\nseventeenth century had driven many of the English to seek a permanent\r\nhome in America.  They struck root and increased and multiplied, giving\r\nthe British a great advantage in the American struggle.  In 1756 and\r\n1760 the French lost Canada to the British and their American\r\ncolonists, and a few years later the British trading company found\r\nitself completely dominant over French, Dutch and Portuguese in the\r\npeninsula of India.  The great Mongol Empire of Baber, Akbar and their\r\nsuccessors had now far gone in decay, and the story of its practical\r\ncapture by a London trading company, the British East India Company, is\r\none of the most extraordinary episodes in the whole history of\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST EFFORT AND FALL OF TIPPOO SULTAN\r\nTHE LAST EFFORT AND FALL OF TIPPOO SULTAN\r\n\r\n_(From the engraving of the picture by Singleton in the British\r\nMuseum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis East India Company had been originally at the time of its\r\nincorporation under Queen Elizabeth no more than a company of sea\r\nadventurers.  Step by step they had been forced to raise troops and arm\r\ntheir ships.  And now this trading company, with its tradition of gain,\r\nfound itself dealing not merely in spices and dyes and tea and jewels,\r\nbut in the revenues and territories of princes and the destinies of\r\nIndia.  It had come to buy and sell, and it found itself achieving a\r\ntremendous piracy.  There was no one to challenge its proceedings.  Is\r\nit any wonder that its captains and commanders and officials, nay, even\r\nits clerks and common soldiers, came back to England loaded with\r\nspoils?\r\n\r\nMen under such circumstances, with a great and wealthy land at their\r\nmercy, could not determine what they might or might not do.  It was a\r\nstrange land to them, with a strange sunlight; its brown people seemed\r\na different race, outside their range of sympathy; its mysterious\r\ntemples sustained fantastic standards of behaviour.  Englishmen at home\r\nwere perplexed when presently these generals and officials came back to\r\nmake dark accusations against each other of extortions and cruelties. \r\nUpon Clive Parliament passed a vote of censure.  He committed suicide\r\nin 1774.  In 1788 Warren Hastings, a second great Indian administrator,\r\nwas impeached and acquitted (1792).  It was a strange and unprecedented\r\nsituation in the world’s history.  The English Parliament found itself\r\nruling over a London trading company, which in its turn was dominating\r\nan empire far greater and more populous than all the domains of the\r\nBritish crown.  To the bulk of the English people India was a remote,\r\nfantastic, almost inaccessible land, to which adventurous poor young\r\nmen went out, to return after many years very rich and very choleric\r\nold gentlemen.  It was difficult for the English to conceive what the\r\nlife of these countless brown millions in the eastern sunshine could\r\nbe.  Their imaginations declined the task.  India remained romantically\r\nunreal.  It was impossible for the English, therefore, to exert any\r\neffective supervision and control over the company’s proceedings.\r\n\r\nAnd while the Western European powers were thus fighting for these\r\nfantastic overseas empires upon every ocean in the world, two great\r\nland conquests were in progress in Asia. China had thrown off the\r\nMongol yoke in 1360, and flourished under the great native dynasty of\r\nthe Mings until 1644.  Then the Manchus, another Mongol people,\r\nreconquered China and remained masters of China until 1912.  Meanwhile\r\nRussia was pushing East and growing to greatness in the world’s\r\naffairs.  The rise of this great central power of the old world, which\r\nis neither altogether of the East nor altogether of the West, is one of\r\nthe utmost importance to our human destiny.  Its expansion is very\r\nlargely due to the appearance of a Christian steppe people, the\r\nCossacks, who formed a barrier between the feudal agriculture of Poland\r\nand Hungary to the west and the Tartar to the east.  The Cossacks were\r\nthe wild east of Europe, and in many ways not unlike the wild west of\r\nthe United States in the middle nineteenth century. All who had made\r\nRussia too hot to hold them, criminals as well as the persecuted\r\ninnocent, rebellious serfs, religious secretaries, thieves, vagabonds,\r\nmurderers, sought asylum in the southern steppes and there made a fresh\r\nstart and fought for life and freedom against Pole, Russian and Tartar\r\nalike. Doubtless fugitives from the Tartars to the east also\r\ncontributed to the Cossack mixture.  Slowly these border folk were\r\nincorporated in the Russian imperial service, much as the highland\r\nclans of Scotland were converted into regiments by the British\r\ngovernment.  New lands were offered them in Asia.  They became a weapon\r\nagainst the dwindling power of the Mongolian nomads, first in Turkestan\r\nand then across Siberia as far as the Amur.\r\n\r\nThe decay of Mongol energy in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries\r\nis very difficult to explain.  Within two or three centuries from the\r\ndays of Jengis and Timurlane Central Asia had relapsed from a period of\r\nworld ascendancy to extreme political impotence.  Changes of climate,\r\nunrecorded pestilences, infections of a malarial type, may have played\r\ntheir part in this recession—which may be only a temporary recession\r\nmeasured by the scale of universal history—of the Central Asian\r\npeoples.  Some authorities think that the spread of Buddhist teaching\r\nfrom China also had a pacifying influence upon them.  At any rate, by\r\nthe sixteenth century the Mongol, Tartar and Turkish peoples were no\r\nlonger pressing outward, but were being invaded, subjugated and pushed\r\nback both by Christian Russia in the west and by China in the east.\r\n\r\nAll through the seventeenth century the Cossacks were spreading\r\neastward from European Russia, and settling wherever they found\r\nagricultural conditions.  Cordons of forts and stations formed a moving\r\nfrontier to these settlements to the south, where the Turkomans were\r\nstill strong and active; to the north-east, however, Russia had no\r\nfrontier until she reached right to the Pacific....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIV\r\nTHE AMERICAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third quarter of the eighteenth century thus saw the remarkable and\r\nunstable spectacle of a Europe divided against itself, and no longer\r\nwith any unifying political or religious idea, yet through the immense\r\nstimulation of men’s imaginations by the printed book, the printed map,\r\nand the opportunity of the new ocean-going shipping, able in a\r\ndisorganized and contentious manner to dominate all the coasts of the\r\nworld. It was a planless, incoherent ebullition of enterprise due to\r\ntemporary and almost accidental advantages over the rest of mankind. By\r\nvirtue of these advantages this new and still largely empty continent\r\nof America was peopled mainly from Western European sources, and South\r\nAfrica and Australia and New Zealand marked down as prospective homes\r\nfor a European population.\r\n\r\nThe motive that had sent Columbus to America and Vasco da Gama to India\r\nwas the perennial first motive of all sailors since the beginning of\r\nthings—trade.  But while in the already populous and productive East\r\nthe trade motive remained dominant, and the European settlements\r\nremained trading settlements from which the European inhabitants hoped\r\nto return home to spend their money, the Europeans in America, dealing\r\nwith communities at a very much lower level of productive activity,\r\nfound a new inducement for persistence in the search for gold and\r\nsilver.  Particularly did the mines of Spanish America yield silver. \r\nThe Europeans had to go to America not simply as armed merchants but as\r\nprospectors, miners, searchers after natural products, and presently as\r\nplanters.  In the north they sought furs.  Mines and plantations\r\nnecessitated settlements.  They obliged people to set up permanent\r\noverseas homes.  Finally in some cases, as when the English Puritans\r\nwent to New England in the early seventeenth 336}century to escape\r\nreligious persecution, when in the eighteenth Oglethorpe sent people\r\nfrom the English debtors’ prisons to Georgia, and when in the end of\r\nthe eighteenth the Dutch sent orphans to the Cape of Good Hope, the\r\nEuropeans frankly crossed the seas to find new homes for good.  In the\r\nnineteenth century, and especially after the coming of the steamship,\r\nthe stream of European emigration to the new empty lands of America and\r\nAustralia rose for some decades to the scale of a great migration.\r\n\r\nSo there grew up permanent overseas populations of Europeans, and the\r\nEuropean culture was transplanted to much larger areas than those in\r\nwhich it had been developed.  These new communities bringing a\r\nready-made civilization with them to these new lands grew up, as it\r\nwere, unplanned and unperceived; the statecraft of Europe did not\r\nforesee them, and was unprepared with any ideas about their treatment. \r\nThe politicians and ministers of Europe continued to regard them as\r\nessentially expeditionary establishments, sources of revenue,\r\n“possessions” and “dependencies,” long after their peoples had\r\ndeveloped a keen sense of their separate social life.  And also they\r\ncontinued to treat them as helplessly subject to the mother country\r\nlong after the population had spread inland out of reach of any\r\neffectual punitive operations from the sea.\r\n\r\nBecause until right into the nineteenth century, it must be remembered,\r\nthe link of all these overseas empires was the oceangoing sailing ship.\r\n On land the swiftest thing was still the horse, and the cohesion and\r\nunity of political systems on land was still limited by the limitations\r\nof horse communications.\r\n\r\nNow at the end of the third quarter of the eighteenth century the\r\nnorthern two-thirds of North America was under the British crown. \r\nFrance had abandoned America.  Except for Brazil, which was Portuguese,\r\nand one or two small islands and areas in French, British, Danish and\r\nDutch hands, Florida, Louisiana, California and all America to the\r\nsouth was Spanish.  It was the British colonies south of Maine and Lake\r\nOntario that first demonstrated the inadequacy of the sailing ship to\r\nhold overseas populations together in one political system.\r\n\r\nThese British colonies were very miscellaneous in their origin and\r\ncharacter.  There were French, Swedish and Dutch settlements as well as\r\nBritish; there were British Catholics in Maryland and British\r\nultra-Protestants in New England, and while the New Englanders farmed\r\ntheir own land and denounced slavery, the British in Virginia and the\r\nsouth were planters employing a swelling multitude of imported negro\r\nslaves.  There was no natural common unity in such states.  To get from\r\none to the other might mean a coasting voyage hardly less tedious than\r\nthe transatlantic crossing.  But the union that diverse origin and\r\nnatural conditions denied the British Americans was forced upon them by\r\nthe selfishness and stupidity of the British government in London. \r\nThey were taxed without any voice in the spending of the taxes; their\r\ntrade was sacrificed to British interests; the highly profitable slave\r\ntrade was maintained by the British government in spite of the\r\nopposition of the Virginians who—though quite willing to hold and use\r\nslaves—feared to be swamped by an ever-growing barbaric black\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n_(From a painting by Gilbert Stuart)_\r\n\r\n\r\nBritain at that time was lapsing towards an intenser form of monarchy,\r\nand the obstinate personality of George III (1760- 1820) did much to\r\nforce on a struggle between the home and the colonial governments.\r\n\r\nThe conflict was precipitated by legislation which favoured the London\r\nEast India Company at the expense of the American shipper.  Three\r\ncargoes of tea which were imported under the new conditions were thrown\r\noverboard in Boston harbour by a band of men disguised as Indians\r\n(1773).  Fighting only began in 1775 when the British government\r\nattempted to arrest two of the American leaders at Lexington near\r\nBoston.  The first shots were fired in Lexington by the British; the\r\nfirst fighting occurred at Concord.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL, NEAR BOSTON\r\nTHE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL, NEAR BOSTON\r\n\r\n_(From the engraving of the picture by John Trumbull in the British\r\nMuseum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the American War of Independence began, though for more than a year\r\nthe colonists showed themselves extremely unwilling to sever their\r\nlinks with the mother land.  It was not until the middle of 1776 that\r\nthe Congress of the insurgent states issued “The Declaration of\r\nIndependence.”  George Washington, who like many of the leading\r\ncolonists of the time had had a military training in the wars against\r\nthe French, was made commander-in-chief.  In 1777 a British general,\r\nGeneral Burgoyne, in an attempt to reach New York from Canada, was\r\ndefeated at Freemans Farm and obliged to surrender at Saratoga.  In the\r\nsame year the French and Spanish declared war upon Great Britain,\r\ngreatly hampering her sea communications.  A second British army under\r\nGeneral Cornwallis was caught in the Yorktown peninsula in Virginia and\r\nobliged to capitulate in 1781.  In 1783 peace was made in Paris, and\r\nthe Thirteen Colonies from Maine to Georgia became a union of\r\nindependent sovereign States.  So the United States of America came\r\ninto existence.  Canada remained loyal to the British flag.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: The United States, showing extent of settlement in 1790\r\n\r\nFor four years these States had only a very feeble central government\r\nunder certain Articles of Confederation, and they seemed destined to\r\nbreak up into separate independent communities.  Their immediate\r\nseparation was delayed by the hostility of the British and a certain\r\naggressiveness on the part of the French which brought home to them the\r\nimmediate dangers of division.  A Constitution was drawn up and\r\nratified in 1788 establishing a more efficient Federal government with\r\na President holding very considerable powers, and the weak sense of\r\nnational unity was invigorated by a second war with Britain in 1812. \r\nNevertheless the area covered by the States was so wide and their\r\ninterests so diverse at that time, that—given only the means of\r\ncommunication then available—a disintegration of the Union into\r\nseparate states on the European scale of size was merely a question of\r\ntime.  Attendance at Washington meant a long, tedious and insecure\r\njourney for the senators and congressmen of the remoter districts, and\r\nthe mechanical impediments to the diffusion of a common education and a\r\ncommon literature and intelligence were practically insurmountable. \r\nForces were at work in the world however that were to arrest the\r\nprocess of differentiation altogether.  Presently came the river\r\nsteamboat and then the railway and the telegraph to save the United\r\nStates from fragmentation, and weave its dispersed people together\r\nagain into the first of great modern nations.\r\n\r\nTwenty-two years later the Spanish colonies in America were to follow\r\nthe example of the Thirteen and break their connection with Europe. \r\nBut being more dispersed over the continent and separated by great\r\nmountainous chains and deserts and forests and by the Portuguese Empire\r\nof Brazil, they did not achieve a union among themselves.  They became\r\na constellation of republican states, very prone at first to wars among\r\nthemselves and to revolutions.\r\n\r\nBrazil followed a rather different line towards the inevitable\r\nseparation.  In 1807 the French armies under Napoleon had occupied the\r\nmother country of Portugal, and the monarchy had fled to Brazil.  From\r\nthat time on until they separated, Portugal was rather a dependency of\r\nBrazil than Brazil of Portugal.  In 1822 Brazil declared itself a\r\nseparate Empire under Pedro I, a son of the Portuguese King. But the\r\nnew world has never been very favourable to monarchy. In 1889 the\r\nEmperor of Brazil was shipped off quietly to Europe, and the United\r\nStates of Brazil fell into line with the rest of republican America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLV\r\nTHE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND THE RESTORATION OF MONARCHY IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nBritain had hardly lost the Thirteen Colonies in America before a\r\nprofound social and political convulsion at the very heart of Grand\r\nMonarchy was to remind Europe still more vividly of the essentially\r\ntemporary nature of the political arrangements of the world.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the French monarchy was the most successful of the\r\npersonal monarchies in Europe.  It was the envy and model of a\r\nmultitude of competing and minor courts.  But it flourished on a basis\r\nof injustice that led to its dramatic collapse.  It was brilliant and\r\naggressive, but it was wasteful of the life and substance of its common\r\npeople.  The clergy and nobility were protected from taxation by a\r\nsystem of exemption that threw the whole burden of the state upon the\r\nmiddle and lower classes.  The peasants were ground down by taxation;\r\nthe middle classes were dominated and humiliated by the nobility.\r\n\r\nIn 1787 this French monarchy found itself bankrupt and obliged to call\r\nrepresentatives of the different classes of the realm into consultation\r\nupon the perplexities of defective income and excessive expenditure. \r\nIn 1789 the States General, a gathering of the nobles, clergy and\r\ncommons, roughly equivalent to the earlier form of the British\r\nParliament, was called together at Versailles.  It had not assembled\r\nsince 1610.  For all that time France had been an absolute monarchy. \r\nNow the people found a means of expressing their long fermenting\r\ndiscontent.  Disputes immediately broke out between the three estates,\r\ndue to the resolve of the Third Estate, the Commons, to control the\r\nAssembly.  The Commons got the better of these disputes and the States\r\nGeneral became a National Assembly, clearly resolved to keep the crown\r\nin order, as the British Parliament kept the British crown in order. \r\nThe king (Louis XVI) prepared for a struggle and brought up troops from\r\nthe provinces.  Whereupon Paris and France revolted.\r\n\r\nThe collapse of the absolute monarchy was very swift.  The grim-looking\r\nprison of the Bastille was stormed by the people of Paris, and the\r\ninsurrection spread rapidly throughout France.  In the east and\r\nnorth-west provinces many chateaux belonging to the nobility were burnt\r\nby the peasants, their title-deeds carefully destroyed, and the owners\r\nmurdered or driven away.  In a month the ancient and decayed system of\r\nthe aristocratic order had collapsed.  Many of the leading princes and\r\ncourtiers of the queen’s party fled abroad. A provisional city\r\ngovernment was set up in Paris and in most of the other large cities,\r\nand a new armed force, the National Guard, a force designed primarily\r\nand plainly to resist the forces of the crown, was brought into\r\nexistence by these municipal bodies.  The National Assembly found\r\nitself called upon to create a new political and social system for a\r\nnew age.\r\n\r\nIt was a task that tried the powers of that gathering to the utmost. \r\nIt made a great sweep of the chief injustices of the absolutist regime;\r\nit abolished tax exemptions, serfdom, aristocratic titles and\r\nprivileges and sought to establish a constitutional monarchy in Paris. \r\nThe king abandoned Versailles and its splendours and kept a diminished\r\nstate in the palace of the Tuileries in Paris.\r\n\r\nFor two years it seemed that the National Assembly might struggle\r\nthrough to an effective modernized government.  Much of its work was\r\nsound and still endures, if much was experimental and had to be undone.\r\n Much was ineffective. There was a clearing up of the penal code;\r\ntorture, arbitrary imprisonment and persecutions for heresy were\r\nabolished.  The ancient provinces of France, Normandy, Burgundy and the\r\nlike gave place to eighty departments.  Promotion to the highest ranks\r\nin the army was laid open to men of every class.  An excellent and\r\nsimple system of law courts was set up, but its value was much vitiated\r\nby having the judges appointed by popular election for short periods of\r\ntime.  This made the crowd a sort of final court of appeal, and the\r\njudges, like the members of the Assembly, were forced to play to the\r\ngallery.  And the whole vast property of the church was seized and\r\nadministered by the state; religious establishments not engaged in\r\neducation or works of charity were broken up, and the salaries of the\r\nclergy made a charge upon the nation.  This in itself was not a bad\r\nthing for the lower clergy in France, who were often scandalously\r\nunderpaid in comparison with the richer dignitaries.  But in addition\r\nthe choice of priests and bishops was made elective, which struck at\r\nthe very root idea of the Roman Church, which centred everything upon\r\nthe Pope, and in which all authority is from above downward. \r\nPractically the National Assembly wanted at one blow to make the church\r\nin France Protestant, in organization if not in doctrine.  Everywhere\r\nthere were disputes and conflicts between the state priests created by\r\nthe National Assembly and the recalcitrant (non-juring) priests who\r\nwere loyal to Rome.\r\n\r\nIn 1791 the experiment of Constitutional monarchy in France was brought\r\nto an abrupt end by the action of the king and queen, working in\r\nconcert with their aristocratic and monarchist friends abroad.  Foreign\r\narmies gathered on the Eastern frontier and one night in June the king\r\nand queen and their children slipped away from the Tuileries and fled\r\nto join the foreigners and the aristocratic exiles.  They were caught\r\nat Varennes and brought back to Paris, and an France flamed up into a\r\npassion of patriotic republicanism.  A Republic was proclaimed, open\r\nwar with Austria and Prussia ensued, and the king was tried and\r\nexecuted (January, 1793) on the model already set by England, for\r\ntreason to his people.\r\n\r\nAnd now followed a strange phase in the history of the French people. \r\nThere arose a great flame of enthusiasm for France and the Republic. \r\nThere was to be an end to compromise at home and abroad; at home\r\nroyalists and every form of disloyalty were to be stamped out; abroad\r\nFrance was to be the protector and helper of all revolutionaries.  All\r\nEurope, all the world, was to become Republican.  The youth of France\r\npoured into the Republican armies; a new and wonderful song spread\r\nthrough the land, a song that still warms the blood like wine, the\r\nMarseillaise.  Before that chant and the leaping columns of French\r\nbayonets and their enthusiastically served guns the foreign armies\r\nrolled back; before the end of 1792 the French armies had gone far\r\nbeyond the utmost achievements of Louis XIV; everywhere they stood on\r\nforeign soil. They were in Brussels, they had overrun Savoy, they had\r\nraided to Mayence; they had seized the Scheldt from Holland. Then the\r\nFrench Government did an unwise thing.  It had been exasperated by the\r\nexpulsion of its representative from England upon the execution of\r\nLouis, and it declared war against England.  It was an unwise thing to\r\ndo, because the revolution which had given France a new enthusiastic\r\ninfantry and a brilliant artillery released from its aristocratic\r\nofficers and many cramping conditions had destroyed the discipline of\r\nthe navy, and the English were supreme upon the sea.  And this\r\nprovocation united all England against France, whereas there had been\r\nat first a very considerable liberal movement in Great Britain in\r\nsympathy with the revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL OF LOUIS XVI\r\nTHE TRIAL OF LOUIS XVI\r\n\r\n_(From a print in the British Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the fight that France made in the next few years against a European\r\ncoalition we cannot tell in any detail.  She drove the Austrians for\r\never out of Belgium, and made Holland a republic.  The Dutch fleet,\r\nfrozen in the Texel, surrendered to a handful of cavalry without firing\r\nits guns. For some time the French thrust towards Italy was hung up,\r\nand it was only in 1796 that a new general, Napoleon Bonaparte, led the\r\nragged and hungry republican armies in triumph across Piedmont to\r\nMantua and Verona.  Says C. F. Atkinson,  [1] “What astonished the\r\nAllies most of all was the number and the velocity of the Republicans. \r\nThese improvised armies had in fact nothing to delay them.  Tents were\r\nunprocurable for want of money, untransportable for want of the\r\nenormous number of wagons that would have been required, and also\r\nunnecessary, for the discomfort that would have caused wholesale\r\ndesertion in professional armies was cheerfully borne by the men of\r\n1793- 94.   Supplies for armies of then unheard-of size could not be\r\ncarried in convoys, and the French soon became familiar with ‘living on\r\nthe country.’  Thus 1793 saw the birth of the modern system of\r\nwar—rapidity of movement, full development of national strength,\r\nbivouacs, requisitions and force as against cautious manœuvring, small\r\nprofessional armies, tents and full rations, and chicane. The first\r\nrepresented the decision-compelling spirit, the second the spirit of\r\nrisking little to gain a little ... .”\r\n\r\nAnd while these ragged hosts of enthusiasts were chanting the\r\nMarseillaise and fighting for _la France_, manifestly never quite clear\r\nin their minds whether they were looting or liberating the countries\r\ninto which they poured, the republican enthusiasm in Paris was spending\r\nitself in a far less glorious fashion.  The revolution was now under\r\nthe sway of a fanatical leader, Robespierre.  This man is difficult to\r\njudge; he was a man of poor physique, naturally timid, and a prig.  But\r\nhe had that most necessary gift for power, faith. He set himself to\r\nsave the Republic as he conceived it, and he imagined it could be saved\r\nby no other man than he.  So that to keep in power was to save the\r\nRepublic.  The living spirit of the Republic, it seemed, had sprung\r\nfrom a slaughter of royalists and the execution of the king.  There\r\nwere insurrections; one in the west, in the district of La Vendée,\r\nwhere the people rose against the conscription and against the\r\ndispossession of the orthodox clergy, and were led by noblemen and\r\npriests; one in the south, where Lyons and Marseilles had risen and the\r\nroyalists of Toulon had admitted an English and Spanish garrison.  To\r\nwhich there seemed no more effectual reply than to go on killing\r\nroyalists.\r\n\r\nThe Revolutionary Tribunal went to work, and a steady slaughtering\r\nbegan.  The invention of the guillotine was opportune to this mood. \r\nThe queen was guillotined, most of Robespierre’s antagonists were\r\nguillotined, atheists who argued that there was no Supreme Being were\r\nguillotined; day by day, week by week, this infernal new machine\r\nchopped off heads and more heads and more.  The reign of Robespierre\r\nlived, it seemed, on blood; and needed more and more, as an opium-taker\r\nneeds more and more opium.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXECUTION OF MARIE ANTOINETTE, QUEEN OF FRANCE, OCTOBER 16, 1793\r\nTHE EXECUTION OF MARIE ANTOINETTE, QUEEN OF FRANCE, OCTOBER 16, 1793\r\n\r\n_(From a print in the British Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally in the summer of 1794 Robespierre himself was overthrown and\r\nguillotined.  He was succeeded by a Directory of five men which carried\r\non the war of defence abroad and held France together at home for five\r\nyears.  Their reign formed a curious interlude in this history of\r\nviolent changes.  They took things as they found them.  The\r\npropagandist zeal of the revolution carried the French armies into\r\nHolland, Belgium, Switzerland, south Germany and north Italy. \r\nEverywhere kings were expelled and republics set up. But such\r\npropagandist zeal as animated the Directorate did not prevent the\r\nlooting of the treasures of the liberated peoples to relieve the\r\nfinancial embarrassment of the French Government.  Their wars became\r\nless and less the holy wars of freedom, and more and more like the\r\naggressive wars of the ancient regime.  The last feature of Grand\r\nMonarchy that France was disposed to discard was her tradition of\r\nforeign policy.  One discovers it still as vigorous under the\r\nDirectorate as if there had been no revolution.\r\n\r\nUnhappily for France and the world a man arose who embodied in its\r\nintensest form this national egotism of the French. He gave that\r\ncountry ten years of glory and the humiliation of a final defeat.  This\r\nwas that same Napoleon Bonaparte who had led the armies of the\r\nDirectory to victory in Italy.\r\n\r\nThroughout the five years of the Directorate he had been scheming and\r\nworking for self-advancement.  Gradually he clambered to supreme power.\r\n He was a man of severely limited understanding but of ruthless\r\ndirectness and great energy. He had begun life as an extremist of the\r\nschool of Robespierre; he owed his first promotion to that side; but he\r\nhad no real grasp of the new forces that were working in Europe.  His\r\nutmost political imagination carried him to a belated and tawdry\r\nattempt to restore the Western Empire.  He tried to destroy the remains\r\nof the old Holy Roman Empire, intending to replace it by a new one\r\ncentring upon Paris. The Emperor in Vienna ceased to be the Holy Roman\r\nEmperor and became simply Emperor of Austria.  Napoleon divorced his\r\nFrench wife in order to marry an Austrian princess.\r\n\r\nHe became practically monarch of France as First Consul in 1799, and he\r\nmade himself Emperor of France in 1804 in direct imitation of\r\nCharlemagne.  He was crowned by the Pope in Paris, taking the crown\r\nfrom the Pope and putting it upon his own head himself as Charlemagne\r\nhad directed.  His son was crowned King of Rome.\r\n\r\nFor some years Napoleon’s reign was a career of victory.  He conquered\r\nmost of Italy and Spain, defeated Prussia and Austria, and dominated\r\nall Europe west of Russia.  But he never won the command of the sea\r\nfrom the British and his fleets sustained a conclusive defeat inflicted\r\nby the British Admiral Nelson at Trafalgar (1805). Spain rose against\r\nhim in 1808 and a British army under Wellington thrust the French\r\narmies slowly northward out of the peninsula.  In 1811 Napoleon came\r\ninto conflict with the Tsar Alexander I, and in 1812 he invaded Russia\r\nwith a great conglomerate army of 600,000 men, that was defeated and\r\nlargely destroyed by the Russians and the Russian winter. Germany rose\r\nagainst him, Sweden turned against him.  The French armies were beaten\r\nback and at Fontainebleau Napoleon abdicated (1814).  He was exiled to\r\nElba, returned to France for one last effort in 1815 and was defeated\r\nby the allied British, Belgians and Prussians at Waterloo.  He died a\r\nBritish prisoner at St. Helena in 1821.\r\n\r\nThe forces released by the French revolution were wasted and finished. \r\nA great Congress of the victorious allies met at Vienna to restore as\r\nfar as possible the state of affairs that the great storm had rent to\r\npieces.  For nearly forty years a sort of peace, a peace of exhausted\r\neffort, was maintained in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In his article, “French Revolutionary Wars,” in the Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVI\r\nTHE UNEASY PEACE IN EUROPE THAT FOLLOWED THE FALL OF NAPOLEON\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo main causes prevented that period from being a complete social and\r\ninternational peace, and prepared the way for the cycle of wars between\r\n1854 and 1871. The first of these was the tendency of the royal courts\r\nconcerned, towards the restoration of unfair privilege and interference\r\nwith freedom of thought and writing and teaching. The second was the\r\nimpossible system of boundaries drawn by the diplomatists of Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe inherent disposition of monarchy to march back towards past\r\nconditions was first and most particularly manifest in Spain.  Here\r\neven the Inquisition was restored.  Across the Atlantic the Spanish\r\ncolonies had followed the example of the United States and revolted\r\nagainst the European Great Power System, when Napoleon set his brother\r\nJoseph on the Spanish throne in 1810.  The George Washington of South\r\nAmerica was General Bolivar.  Spain was unable to suppress this revolt,\r\nit dragged on much as the United States War of Independence had dragged\r\non, and at last the suggestion was made by Austria, in accordance with\r\nthe spirit of the Holy Alliance, that the European monarch should\r\nassist Spain in this struggle.  This was opposed by Britain in Europe,\r\nbut it was the prompt action of President Monroe of the United States\r\nin 1823 which conclusively warned off this projected monarchist\r\nrestoration.  He announced that the United States would regard any\r\nextension of the European system in the Western Hemisphere as a hostile\r\nact.  Thus arose the Monroe Doctrine, the doctrine that there must be\r\nno extension of extra- American government in America, which has kept\r\nthe Great Power system out of America for nearly a hundred years and\r\npermitted the new states of Spanish America to work out their destinies\r\nalong their own lines.\r\n\r\nBut if Spanish monarchism lost its colonies, it could at least, under\r\nthe protection of the Concert of Europe, do what it chose in Europe.  A\r\npopular insurrection in Spain was crushed by a French army in 1823,\r\nwith a mandate from a European congress, and simultaneously Austria\r\nsuppressed a revolution in Naples.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by Charles X. Charles set\r\nhimself to destroy the liberty of the press and universities, and to\r\nrestore absolute government; the sum of a billion francs was voted to\r\ncompensate the nobles for the chateau burnings and sequestrations of\r\n1789.  In 1830 Paris rose against this embodiment of the ancient\r\nregime, and replaced him by Louis Philippe, the son of that Philip,\r\nDuke of Orleans, who was executed during the Terror.  The other\r\ncontinental monarchies, in face of the open approval of the revolution\r\nby Great Britain and a strong liberal ferment in Germany and Austria,\r\ndid not interfere in this affair.  After all, France was still a\r\nmonarchy.  This man Louis Philippe (1830-48) remained the\r\nconstitutional King of France for eighteen years.\r\n\r\nSuch were the uneasy swayings of the peace of the Congress of Vienna,\r\nwhich were provoked by the reactionary proceedings of the monarchists. \r\nThe stresses that arose from the unscientific boundaries planned by the\r\ndiplomatists at Vienna gathered force more deliberately, but they were\r\neven more dangerous to the peace of mankind.  It is extraordinarily\r\ninconvenient to administer together the affairs of peoples speaking\r\ndifferent languages and so reading different literatures and having\r\ndifferent general ideas, especially if those differences are\r\nexacerbated by religious disputes. Only some strong mutual interest,\r\nsuch as the common defensive needs of the Swiss mountaineers, can\r\njustify a close linking of peoples of dissimilar languages and faiths;\r\nand even in Switzerland there is the utmost local autonomy. When, as in\r\nMacedonia, populations are mixed in a patchwork of villages and\r\ndistricts, the cantonal system is imperatively needed.  But if the\r\nreader will look at the map of Europe as the Congress of Vienna drew\r\nit, he will see that this gathering seems almost as if it had planned\r\nthe maximum of local exasperation.\r\n\r\nIt destroyed the Dutch Republic, quite needlessly, it lumped together\r\nthe Protestant Dutch with the French-speaking Catholics of the old\r\nSpanish (Austrian) Netherlands, and set up a kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands.  It handed over not merely the old republic of Venice, but\r\nall of North Italy as far as Milan to the German-speaking Austrians. \r\nFrench-speaking Savoy it combined with pieces of Italy to restore the\r\nkingdom of Sardinia.  Austria and Hungary, already a sufficiently\r\nexplosive mixture of discordant nationalities, Germans, Hungarians,\r\nCzecho-Slovaks, Jugo-Slavs, Roumanians, and now Italians, was made\r\nstill more impossible by confirming Austria’s Polish acquisitions of\r\n1772 and 1795.  The Catholic and republican-spirited Polish people were\r\nchiefly given over to the less civilized rule of the Greek-orthodox\r\nTsar, but important districts went to Protestant Prussia. The Tsar was\r\nalso confirmed in his acquisition of the entirely alien Finns.  The\r\nvery dissimilar Norwegian and Swedish peoples were bound together under\r\none king.  Germany, the reader will see, was left in a particularly\r\ndangerous state of muddle.  Prussia and Austria were both partly in and\r\npartly out of a German confederation, which included a multitude of\r\nminor states.  The King of Denmark came into the German confederation\r\nby virtue of certain German-speaking possessions in Holstein. \r\nLuxembourg was included in the German confederation, though its ruler\r\nwas also King of the Netherlands, and though many of its peoples talked\r\nFrench.\r\n\r\nHere was a complete disregard of the fact that the people who talk\r\nGerman and base their ideas on German literature, the people who talk\r\nItalian and base their ideas on Italian literature, and the people who\r\ntalk Polish and base their ideas on Polish literature, will all be far\r\nbetter off and most helpful and least obnoxious to the rest of mankind\r\nif they conduct their own affairs in their own idiom within the\r\nring-fence of their own speech.  Is it any wonder that one of the most\r\npopular songs in Germany during this period declared that wherever the\r\nGerman tongue was spoken, there was the German Fatherland!\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTRAIT OF NAPOLEON (CORONATION)\r\nPORTRAIT OF NAPOLEON (CORONATION)\r\n\r\n_(From a print in the British Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1830 French-speaking Belgium, stirred up by the current revolution\r\nin France, revolted against its Dutch association in the kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands.  The powers, terrified at the possibilities of a republic\r\nor of annexation to France, hurried in to pacify this situation, and\r\ngave the Belgians a monarch, Leopold I of Saxe-Coburg Gotha.  There\r\nwere also ineffectual revolts in Italy and Germany in 1830, and a much\r\nmore serious one in Russian Poland.  A republican government held out\r\nin Warsaw for a year against Nicholas I (who succeeded Alexander in\r\n1825), and was then stamped out of existence with great violence and\r\ncruelty.  The Polish language was banned, and the Greek Orthodox church\r\nwas substituted for the Roman Catholic as the state religion ....\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: Europe after the Congress of Vienna\r\n\r\nIn 1821 there was an insurrection of the Greeks against the Turks.  For\r\nsix years they fought a desperate war, while the governments of Europe\r\nlooked on.  Liberal opinion protested against this inactivity;\r\nvolunteers from every European country joined the insurgents, and at\r\nlast Britain, France and Russia took joint action.  The Turkish fleet\r\nwas destroyed by the French and English at the battle of Navarino\r\n(1827), and the Tsar invaded Turkey.  By the treaty of Adrianople\r\n(1829) Greece was declared free, but she was not permitted to resume\r\nher ancient republican traditions.  A German king was found for Greece,\r\none Prince Otto of Bavaria, and Christian governors were set up in the\r\nDanubian provinces (which are now Roumania) and Serbia (a part of the\r\nJugo-Slav region).  Much blood had still to run however before the Turk\r\nwas altogether expelled from these lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVII\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF MATERIAL KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the opening\r\nyears of the nineteenth century, while these conflicts of the powers\r\nand princes were going on in Europe, and the patchwork of the treaty of\r\nWestphalia (1648) was changing kaleidoscopically into the patchwork of\r\nthe treaty of Vienna (1815), and while the sailing ship was spreading\r\nEuropean influence throughout the world, a steady growth of knowledge\r\nand a general clearing up of men’s ideas about the world in which they\r\nlived was in progress in the European and Europeanized world.\r\n\r\nIt went on disconnected from political life, and producing throughout\r\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries no striking immediate results\r\nin political life.  Nor was it affecting popular thought very\r\nprofoundly during this period. These reactions were to come later, and\r\nonly in their full force in the latter half of the nineteenth century. \r\nIt was a process that went on chiefly in a small world of prosperous\r\nand independent-spirited people.  Without what the English call the\r\n“private gentleman,” the scientific process could not have begun in\r\nGreece, and could not have been renewed in Europe.  The universities\r\nplayed a part but not a leading part in the philosophical and\r\nscientific thought of this period.  Endowed learning is apt to be timid\r\nand conservative learning, lacking in initiative and resistent to\r\ninnovation, unless it has the spur of contact with independent minds.\r\n\r\nWe have already noted the formation of the Royal Society in 1662 and\r\nits work in realizing the dream of Bacon’s _New Atlantis_.  Throughout\r\nthe eighteenth century there was much clearing up of general ideas\r\nabout matter and motion, much mathematical advance, a systematic\r\ndevelopment of the use of optical glass in microscope and telescope, a\r\nrenewed energy in classificatory natural history, a great revival of\r\nanatomical science.  The science of geology—foreshadowed by Aristotle\r\nand anticipated by Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519)—began its great task\r\nof interpreting the Record of the Rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY ROLLING STOCK ON THE LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER RAILWAY IN THE\r\nFIRST DAYS OF THE RAILWAY\r\nEARLY ROLLING STOCK ON THE LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER RAILWAY IN THE\r\nFIRST DAYS OF THE RAILWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe progress of physical science reacted upon metallurgy. Improved\r\nmetallurgy, affording the possibility of a larger and bolder handling\r\nof masses of metal and other materials, reacted upon practical\r\ninventions.  Machinery on a new scale and in a new abundance appeared\r\nto revolutionize industry.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 Trevithick adapted the Watt engine to transport and made the\r\nfirst locomotive.  In 1825 the first railway, between Stockton and\r\nDarlington, was opened, and Stephenson’s “Rocket,” with a thirteen-ton\r\ntrain, got up to a speed of forty-four miles per hour.  From 1830\r\nonward railways multiplied.  By the middle of the century a network of\r\nrailways had spread all over Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY TRAVELLING ON THE LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER RAILWAY, 1833\r\nEARLY TRAVELLING ON THE LIVERPOOL AND MANCHESTER RAILWAY, 1833\r\n\r\n\r\nHere was a sudden change in what had long been a fixed condition of\r\nhuman life, the maximum rate of land transport. After the Russian\r\ndisaster, Napoleon travelled from near Vilna to Paris in 312 hours. \r\nThis was a journey of about 1,400 miles.  He was travelling with every\r\nconceivable advantage, and he averaged under 5 miles an hour.  An\r\nordinary traveller could not have done this distance in twice the time.\r\n These were about the same maximum rates of travel as held good between\r\nRome and Gaul in the first century A.D.  Then suddenly came this\r\ntremendous change.  The railways reduced this journey for any ordinary\r\ntraveller to less than forty-eight hours.  That is to say, they reduced\r\nthe chief European distances to about a tenth of what they had been. \r\nThey made it possible to carry out administrative work in areas ten\r\ntimes as great as any that had hitherto been workable under one\r\nadministration.  The full significance of that possibility in Europe\r\nstill remains to be realized.  Europe is still netted in boundaries\r\ndrawn in the horse and road era.  In America the effects were\r\nimmediate.  To the United States of America, sprawling westward, it\r\nmeant the possibility of a continuous access to Washington, however far\r\nthe frontier travelled across the continent.  It meant unity, sustained\r\non a scale that would otherwise have been impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STEAMBOAT: CLERMONT, 1807, U.S.A.\r\nTHE STEAMBOAT: _CLERMONT_, 1807, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe steamboat was, if anything, a little ahead of the steam engine in\r\nits earlier phases.  There was a steamboat, the _Charlotte Dundas_, on\r\nthe Firth of Clyde Canal in 1802, and in 1807 an American named Fulton\r\nhad a steamer, the Clermont, with British-built engines, upon the\r\nHudson River above New York.  The first steamship to put to sea was\r\nalso an American, the Phœnix, which went from New York (Hoboken) to\r\nPhiladelphia.  So, too, was the first ship using steam (she also had\r\nsails) to cross the Atlantic, the Savannah (1819).  All these were\r\npaddle-wheel boats and paddle-wheel boats are not adapted to work in\r\nheavy seas. The paddles smash too easily, and the boat is then\r\ndisabled. The screw steamship followed rather slowly.  Many\r\ndifficulties had to be surmounted before the screw was a practicable\r\nthing.  Not until the middle of the century did the tonnage of\r\nsteamships upon the sea begin to overhaul that of sailing ships.  After\r\nthat the evolution in sea transport was rapid.  For the first time men\r\nbegan to cross the seas and oceans with some certainty as to the date\r\nof their arrival.  The transatlantic crossing, which had been an\r\nuncertain adventure of several weeks—which might stretch to months—was\r\naccelerated, until in 1910 it was brought down, in the case of the\r\nfastest boats, to under five days, with a practically notifiable hour\r\nof arrival.\r\n\r\nConcurrently with the development of steam transport upon land and sea\r\na new and striking addition to the facilities of human intercourse\r\narose out of the investigations of Volta, Galvani and Faraday into\r\nvarious electrical phenomena.  The electric telegraph came into\r\nexistence in 1835.  The first underseas cable was laid in 1851 between\r\nFrance and England. In a few years the telegraph system had spread over\r\nthe civilized world, and news which had hitherto travelled slowly from\r\npoint to point became practically simultaneous throughout the earth.\r\n\r\nThese things, the steam railway and the electric telegraph, were to the\r\npopular imagination of the middle nineteenth century the most striking\r\nand revolutionary of inventions, but they were only the most\r\nconspicuous and clumsy first fruits of a far more extensive process. \r\nTechnical knowledge and skill were developing with an extraordinary\r\nrapidity, and to an extraordinary extent measured by the progress of\r\nany previous age.  Far less conspicuous at first in everyday life, but\r\nfinally far more important, was the extension of man’s power over\r\nvarious structural materials.  Before the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury iron was reduced from its ores by means of wood charcoal, was\r\nhandled in small pieces, and hammered and wrought into shape. It was\r\nmaterial for a craftsman.  Quality and treatment were enormously\r\ndependent upon the experience and sagacity of the individual\r\niron-worker.  The largest masses of iron that could be dealt with under\r\nthose conditions amounted at most (in the sixteenth century) to two or\r\nthree tons.  (There was a very definite upward limit, therefore, to the\r\nsize of cannon.)  The blast-furnace rose in the eighteenth century and\r\ndeveloped with the use of coke.  Not before the eighteenth century do\r\nwe find rolled sheet iron (1728) and rolled rods and bars (1783). \r\nNasmyth’s steam hammer came as late as 1838.\r\n\r\nThe ancient world, because of its metallurgical inferiority, could not\r\nuse steam.  The steam engine, even the primitive pumping engine, could\r\nnot develop before sheet iron was available.  The early engines seem to\r\nthe modern eye very pitiful and clumsy bits of ironmongery, but they\r\nwere the utmost that the metallurgical science of the time could do. As\r\nlate as 1856 came the Bessemer process, and presently (1864) the\r\nopen-hearth process, in which steel and every sort of iron could be\r\nmelted, purified and cast in a manner and upon a scale hitherto unheard\r\nof.  To-day in the electric furnace one may see tons of incandescent\r\nsteel swirling about like boiling milk in a saucepan.  Nothing in the\r\nprevious practical advances of mankind is comparable in its\r\nconsequences to the complete mastery over enormous masses of steel and\r\niron and over their texture and quality which man has now achieved. \r\nThe railways and early engines of all sorts were the mere first\r\ntriumphs of the new metallurgical methods.  Presently came ships of\r\niron and steel, vast bridges, and a new way of building with steel upon\r\na gigantic scale.  Men realized too late that they had planned their\r\nrailways with far too timid a gauge, that they could have organized\r\ntheir travelling with far more steadiness and comfort upon a much\r\nbigger scale.\r\n\r\nBefore the nineteenth century there were no ships in the world much\r\nover 2,000 tons burthen; now there is nothing wonderful about a\r\n50,000-ton liner.  There are people who sneer at this kind of progress\r\nas being a progress in “mere size,” but that sort of sneering merely\r\nmarks the intellectual limitations of those who indulge in it.  The\r\ngreat ship or the steel-frame building is not, as they imagine, a\r\nmagnified version of the small ship or building of the past; it is a\r\nthing different in kind, more lightly and strongly built, of finer and\r\nstronger materials; instead of being a thing of precedent and\r\nrule-of-thumb, it is a thing of subtle and intricate calculation.  In\r\nthe old house or ship, matter was dominant—the material and its needs\r\nhad to be slavishly obeyed; in the new, matter had been captured,\r\nchanged, coerced.  Think of the coal and iron and sand dragged out of\r\nthe banks and pits, wrenched, wrought, molten and cast, to be flung at\r\nlast, a slender glittering pinnacle of steel and glass, six hundred\r\nfeet above the crowded city!\r\n\r\nWe have given these particulars of the advance in man’s knowledge of\r\nthe metallurgy of steel and its results by way of illustration.  A\r\nparallel story could be told of the metallurgy of copper and tin, and\r\nof a multitude of metals, nickel and aluminium to name but two, unknown\r\nbefore the nineteenth century dawned.  It is in this great and growing\r\nmastery over substances, over different sorts of glass, over rocks and\r\nplasters and the like, over colours and textures, that the main\r\ntriumphs of the mechanical revolution have thus far been achieved.  Yet\r\nwe are still in the stage of the first fruits in the matter.  We have\r\nthe power, but we have still to learn how to use our power.  Many of\r\nthe first employments of these gifts of science have been vulgar,\r\ntawdry, stupid or horrible.  The artist and the adaptor have still\r\nhardly begun to work with the endless variety of substances now at\r\ntheir disposal.\r\n\r\nParallel with this extension of mechanical possibilities the new\r\nscience of electricity grew up.  It was only in the eighties of the\r\nnineteenth century that this body of enquiry began to yield results to\r\nimpress the vulgar mind.  Then suddenly came electric light and\r\nelectric traction, and the transmutation of forces, the possibility of\r\nsending power, that could be changed into mechanical motion or light or\r\nheat as one chose, along a copper wire, as water is sent along a pipe,\r\nbegan to come through to the ideas of ordinary people....\r\n\r\nThe British and French were at first the leading peoples in this great\r\nproliferation of knowledge; but presently the Germans, who had learnt\r\nhumility under Napoleon, showed such zeal and pertinacity in scientific\r\nenquiry as to overhaul these leaders.  British science was largely the\r\ncreation of Englishmen and Scotchmen working outside the ordinary\r\ncentres of erudition.\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTEENTH CENTURY SPINNING WHEEL\r\nEIGHTEENTH CENTURY SPINNING WHEEL\r\n\r\n_In the Ipswich Museum_\r\n\r\nMODEL OF ARKWRIGHT’S SPINNING JENNY, 1769\r\nMODEL OF ARKWRIGHT’S SPINNING JENNY, 1769\r\n\r\n_From the specifications in the Patent Office_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe universities of Britain were at this time in a state of educational\r\nretrogression, largely given over to a pedantic conning of the Latin\r\nand Greek classics.  French education, too, was dominated by the\r\nclassical tradition of the Jesuit schools, and consequently it was not\r\ndifficult for the Germans to organize a body of investigators, small\r\nindeed in relation to the possibilities of the case, but large in\r\nproportion to the little band of British and French inventors and\r\nexperimentalists.  And though this work of research and experiment was\r\nmaking Britain and France the most rich and powerful countries in the\r\nworld, it was not making scientific and inventive men rich and\r\npowerful.  There is a necessary unworldliness about a sincere\r\nscientific man; he is too preoccupied with his research to plan and\r\nscheme how to make money out of it.  The economic exploitation of his\r\ndiscoveries falls very easily and naturally, therefore, into the hands\r\nof a more acquisitive type; and so we find that the crops of rich men\r\nwhich every fresh phase of scientific and technical progress has\r\nproduced in Great Britain, though they have not displayed quite the\r\nsame passionate desire to insult and kill the goose that laid the\r\nnational golden eggs as the scholastic and clerical professions, have\r\nbeen quite content to let that profitable creature starve.  Inventors\r\nand discoverers came by nature, they thought, for cleverer people to\r\nprofit by.\r\n\r\nIn this matter the Germans were a little wiser.  The German “learned”\r\ndid not display the same vehement hatred of the new learning.  They\r\npermitted its development. The German business man and manufacturer\r\nagain had not quite the same contempt for the man of science as had his\r\nBritish competitor.  Knowledge, these Germans believed, might be a\r\ncultivated crop, responsive to fertilizers.  They did concede,\r\ntherefore, a certain amount of opportunity to the scientific mind;\r\ntheir public expenditure on scientific work was relatively greater, and\r\nthis expenditure was abundantly rewarded.  By the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century the German scientific worker had made German a\r\nnecessary language for every science student who wished to keep abreast\r\nwith the latest work in his department, and in certain branches, and\r\nparticularly in chemistry, Germany acquired a very great superiority\r\nover her western neighbours.  The scientific effort of the sixties and\r\nseventies in Germany began to tell after the eighties, and the German\r\ngained steadily upon Britain and France in technical and industrial\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nA fresh phase in the history of invention opened when in the eighties a\r\nnew type of engine came into use, an engine in which the expansive\r\nforce of an explosive mixture replaced the expansive force of steam. \r\nThe light, highly efficient engines that were thus made possible were\r\napplied to the automobile, and developed at last to reach such a pitch\r\nof lightness and efficiency as to render flight—long known to be\r\npossible—a practical achievement.  A successful flying machine—but not\r\na machine large enough to take up a human body—was made by Professor\r\nLangley of the Smithsonian Institute of Washington as early as 1897. \r\nBy 1909 the aeroplane was available for human locomotion.  There had\r\nseemed to be a pause in the increase of human speed with the perfection\r\nof railways and automobile road traction, but with the flying machine\r\ncame fresh reductions in the effective distance between one point of\r\nthe earth’s surface and another.  In the eighteenth century the\r\ndistance from London to Edinburgh was an eight days’ journey; in 1918\r\nthe British Civil Air Transport Commission reported that the journey\r\nfrom London to Melbourne, halfway round the earth, would probably in a\r\nfew years’ time be accomplished in that same period of eight days.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EARLY WEAVING MACHINE\r\nAN EARLY WEAVING MACHINE\r\n\r\n_From an engraving by W. Hincks in the British Museum_\r\n\r\n\r\nToo much stress must not be laid upon these striking reductions in the\r\ntime distances of one place from another. They are merely one aspect of\r\na much profounder and more momentous enlargement of human possibility. \r\nThe science of agriculture and agricultural chemistry, for instance,\r\nmade quite parallel advances during the nineteenth century.  Men learnt\r\nso to fertilize the soil as to produce quadruple and quintuple the\r\ncrops got from the same area in the seventeenth century.  There was a\r\nstill more extraordinary advance in medical science; the average\r\nduration of life rose, the daily efficiency increased, the waste of\r\nlife through ill-health diminished.\r\n\r\nNow here altogether we have such a change in human life as to\r\nconstitute a fresh phase of history.  In a little more than a century\r\nthis mechanical revolution has been brought about. In that time man\r\nmade a stride in the material conditions of his life vaster than he had\r\ndone during the whole long interval between the palæolithic stage and\r\nthe age of cultivation, or between the days of Pepi in Egypt and those\r\nof George III.  A new gigantic material framework for human affairs has\r\ncome into existence.  Clearly it demands great readjustments of our\r\nsocial, economical and political methods.  But these readjustments have\r\nnecessarily waited upon the development of the mechanical revolution,\r\nand they are still only in their opening stage to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVIII\r\nTHE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency in many histories to confuse together what we have\r\nhere called the mechanical revolution, which was an entirely new thing\r\nin human experience arising out of the development of organized\r\nscience, a new step like the invention of agriculture or the discovery\r\nof metals, with something else, quite different in its origins,\r\nsomething for which there was already an historical precedent, the\r\nsocial and financial development which is called the _industrial\r\nrevolution_. The two processes were going on together, they were\r\nconstantly reacting upon each other, but they were in root and essence\r\ndifferent. There would have been an industrial revolution of sorts if\r\nthere had been no coal, no steam, no machinery; but in that case it\r\nwould probably have followed far more closely upon the lines of the\r\nsocial and financial developments of the later years of the Roman\r\nRepublic. It would have repeated the story of dispossessed free\r\ncultivators, gang labour, great estates, great financial fortunes, and\r\na socially destructive financial process. Even the factory method came\r\nbefore power and machinery. Factories were the product not of\r\nmachinery, but of the “division of labour.” Drilled and sweated workers\r\nwere making such things as millinery cardboard boxes and furniture, and\r\ncolouring maps and book illustrations and so forth, before even\r\nwater-wheels had been used for industrial purposes. There were\r\nfactories in Rome in the days of Augustus. New books, for instance,\r\nwere dictated to rows of copyists in the factories of the book-sellers.\r\nThe attentive student of Defoe and of the political pamphlets of\r\nFielding will realize that the idea of herding poor people into\r\nestablishments to work collectively for their living was already\r\ncurrent in Britain before the close of the seventeenth century. There\r\nare intimations of it even as early as More’s _Utopia_ (1516). It was a\r\nsocial and not a mechanical development.\r\n\r\nUp to past the middle of the eighteenth century the social and economic\r\nhistory of western Europe was in fact retreading the path along which\r\nthe Roman state had gone in the last three centuries B.C.  But the\r\npolitical disunions of Europe, the political convulsions against\r\nmonarchy, the recalcitrance of the common folk and perhaps also the\r\ngreater accessibility of the western European intelligence to\r\nmechanical ideas and inventions, turned the process into quite novel\r\ndirections.  Ideas of human solidarity, thanks to Christianity, were\r\nfar more widely diffused in the newer European world, political power\r\nwas not so concentrated, and the man of energy anxious to get rich\r\nturned his mind, therefore, very willingly from the ideas of the slave\r\nand of gang labour to the idea of mechanical power and the machine.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical revolution, the process of mechanical invention and\r\ndiscovery, was a new thing in human experience and it went on\r\nregardless of the social, political, economic and industrial\r\nconsequences it might produce.  The industrial revolution, on the other\r\nhand, like most other human affairs, was and is more and more\r\nprofoundly changed and deflected by the constant variation in human\r\nconditions caused by the mechanical revolution.  And the essential\r\ndifference between the amassing of riches, the extinction of small\r\nfarmers and small business men, and the phase of big finance in the\r\nlatter centuries of the Roman Republic on the one hand, and the very\r\nsimilar concentration of capital in the eighteenth and nineteenth\r\ncenturies on the other, lies in the profound difference in the\r\ncharacter of labour that the mechanical revolution was bringing about. \r\nThe power of the old world was human power; everything depended\r\nultimately upon the driving power of human muscle, the muscle of\r\nignorant and subjugated men.  A little animal muscle, supplied by draft\r\noxen, horse traction and the like, contributed.  Where a weight had to\r\nbe lifted, men lifted it; where a rock had to be quarried, men chipped\r\nit out; where a field had to be ploughed, men and oxen ploughed it; the\r\nRoman equivalent of the steamship was the galley with its bank of\r\nsweating rowers.  A vast proportion of mankind in the early\r\ncivilizations were employed in purely mechanical drudgery. At its\r\nonset, power-driven machinery did not seem to promise any release from\r\nsuch unintelligent toil.  Great gangs of men were employed in\r\nexcavating canals, in making railway cuttings and embankments, and the\r\nlike.  The number of miners increased enormously.  But the extension of\r\nfacilities and the output of commodities increased much more.  And as\r\nthe nineteenth century went on, the plain logic of the new situation\r\nasserted itself more clearly.  Human beings were no longer wanted as a\r\nsource of mere indiscriminated power.  What could be done mechanically\r\nby a human being could be done faster and better by a machine.  The\r\nhuman being was needed now only where choice and intelligence had to be\r\nexercised.  Human beings were wanted only as human beings.  The drudge,\r\non whom all the previous civilizations had rested, the creature of mere\r\nobedience, the man whose brains were superfluous, had become\r\nunnecessary to the welfare of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCIDENT IN THE DAYS OF THE SLAVE TRADE\r\nINCIDENT IN THE DAYS OF THE SLAVE TRADE\r\n\r\n_From a print after Morland in the British Museum_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was as true of such ancient industries as agriculture and mining\r\nas it was of the newest metallurgical processes. For ploughing, sowing\r\nand harvesting, swift machines came forward to do the work of scores of\r\nmen.  The Roman civilization was built upon cheap and degraded human\r\nbeings; modern civilization is being rebuilt upon cheap mechanical\r\npower.  For a hundred years power has been getting cheaper and labour\r\ndearer.  If for a generation or so machinery has had to wait its turn\r\nin the mine, it is simply because for a time men were cheaper than\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY FACTORY, IN COLEBROOKDALE\r\nEARLY FACTORY, IN COLEBROOKDALE\r\n\r\n_From a print the British Museum_\r\n\r\n\r\nNow here was a change-over of quite primary importance in human\r\naffairs.  The chief solicitude of the rich and of the ruler in the old\r\ncivilization had been to keep up a supply of drudges.  As the\r\nnineteenth century went on, it became more and more plain to the\r\nintelligent directive people that the common man had now to be\r\nsomething better than a drudge.  He had to be educated—if only to\r\nsecure “industrial efficiency.”  He had to understand what he was\r\nabout. From the days of the first Christian propaganda, popular\r\neducation had been smouldering in Europe, just as it had smouldered in\r\nAsia wherever Islam has set its foot, because of the necessity of\r\nmaking the believer understand a little of the belief by which he is\r\nsaved, and of enabling him to read a little in the sacred books by\r\nwhich his belief is conveyed. Christian controversies, with their\r\ncompetition for adherents, ploughed the ground for the harvest of\r\npopular education.  In England, for instance, by the thirties and\r\nforties of the nineteenth century, the disputes of the sects and the\r\nnecessity of catching adherents young had produced a series of\r\ncompeting educational organizations for children, the church “National”\r\nschools, the dissenting “British” schools, and even Roman Catholic\r\nelementary schools.  The second half of the nineteenth century was a\r\nperiod of rapid advance in popular education throughout all the\r\nWesternized world.  There was no parallel advance in the education of\r\nthe upper classes—some advance, no doubt, but nothing to correspond—and\r\nso the great gulf that had divided that world hitherto into the readers\r\nand the non-reading mass became little more than a slightly perceptible\r\ndifference in educational level.  At the back of this process was the\r\nmechanical revolution, apparently regardless of social conditions, but\r\nreally insisting inexorably upon the complete abolition of a totally\r\nilliterate class throughout the world.\r\n\r\nThe economic revolution of the Roman Republic had never been clearly\r\napprehended by the common people of Rome.  The ordinary Roman citizen\r\nnever saw the changes through which he lived, clearly and\r\ncomprehensively as we see them.  But the industrial revolution, as it\r\nwent on towards the end of the nineteenth century, was more and more\r\ndistinctly _seen_ as one whole process by the common people it was\r\naffecting, because presently they could read and discuss and\r\ncommunicate, and because they went about and saw things as no\r\ncommonalty had ever done before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIX\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN POLITICAL AND SOCIAL IDEAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe institutions and customs and political ideas of the ancient\r\ncivilizations grew up slowly, age by age, no man designing and no man\r\nforeseeing. It was only in that great century of human adolescence, the\r\nsixth century B.C., that men began to think clearly about their\r\nrelations to one another, and first to question and first propose to\r\nalter and rearrange the established beliefs and laws and methods of\r\nhuman government.\r\n\r\nWe have told of the glorious intellectual dawn of Greece and\r\nAlexandria, and how presently the collapse of the slave- holding\r\ncivilizations and the clouds of religious intolerance and absolutist\r\ngovernment darkened the promise of that beginning.  The light of\r\nfearless thinking did not break through the European obscurity again\r\neffectually until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.  We have tried\r\nto show something of the share of the great winds of Arab curiosity and\r\nMongol conquest in this gradual clearing of the mental skies of Europe.\r\n And at first it was chiefly material knowledge that increased.  The\r\nfirst fruits of the recovered manhood of the race were material\r\nachievements and material power.  The science of human relationship, of\r\nindividual and social psychology, of education and of economics, are\r\nnot only more subtle and intricate in themselves but also bound up\r\ninextricably with much emotional matter.  The advances made in them\r\nhave been slower and made against greater opposition.  Men will listen\r\ndispassionately to the most diverse suggestions about stars or\r\nmolecules, but ideas about our ways of life touch and reflect upon\r\neveryone about us.\r\n\r\nAnd just as in Greece the bold speculations of Plato came before\r\nAristotle’s hard search for fact, so in Europe the first political\r\nenquiries of the new phase were put in the form of “Utopian” stories,\r\ndirectly imitated from Plato’s _Republic_ and his _Laws_.  Sir Thomas\r\nMore’s _Utopia_ is a curious imitation of Plato that bore fruit in a\r\nnew English poor law.  The Neapolitan Campanella’s _City of the Sun_\r\nwas more fantastic and less fruitful.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the seventeenth century we find a considerable and\r\ngrowing literature of political and social science was being produced. \r\nAmong the pioneers in this discussion was John Locke, the son of an\r\nEnglish republican, an Oxford scholar who first directed his attention\r\nto chemistry and medicine.  His treatises on government, toleration and\r\neducation show a mind fully awake to the possibilities of social\r\nreconstruction.  Parallel with and a little later than John Locke in\r\nEngland, Montesquieu (1689-1755) in France subjected social, political\r\nand religious institutions to a searching and fundamental analysis.  He\r\nstripped the magical prestige from the absolutist monarchy in France. \r\nHe shares with Locke the credit for clearing away many of the false\r\nideas that had hitherto prevented deliberate and conscious attempts to\r\nreconstruct human society.\r\n\r\nThe generation that followed him in the middle and later decades of the\r\neighteenth century was boldly speculative upon the moral and\r\nintellectual clearings he had made.  A group of brilliant writers, the\r\n“Encyclopædists,” mostly rebel spirits from the excellent schools of\r\nthe Jesuits, set themselves to scheme out a new world (1766). Side by\r\nside with the Encyclopædists were the Economists or Physiocrats, who\r\nwere making bold and crude enquiries into the production and\r\ndistribution of food and goods.  Morelly, the author of the _Code de La\r\nNature_, denounced the institution of private property and proposed a\r\ncommunistic organization of society.  He was the precursor of that\r\nlarge and various school of collectivist thinkers in the nineteenth\r\ncentury who are lumped together as Socialists.\r\n\r\nWhat is Socialism?  There are a hundred definitions of Socialism and a\r\nthousand sects of Socialists.  Essentially Socialism is no more and no\r\nless than a criticism of the idea of property in the light of the\r\npublic good.  We may review the history of that idea through the ages\r\nvery briefly.  That and the idea of internationalism are the two\r\ncardinal ideas upon which most of our political life is turning.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARL MARX\r\nCARL MARX\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Linde & Co._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe idea of property arises out of the combative instincts of the\r\nspecies.  Long before men were men, the ancestral ape was a proprietor.\r\n Primitive property is what a beast will fight for.  The dog and his\r\nbone, the tigress and her lair, the roaring stag and his herd, these\r\nare proprietorship blazing. No more nonsensical expression is\r\nconceivable in sociology than the term “primitive communism.”  The Old\r\nMan of the family tribe of early palæolithic times insisted upon his\r\nproprietorship in his wives and daughters, in his tools, in his visible\r\nuniverse.  If any other man wandered into his visible universe he\r\nfought him, and if he could he slew him. The tribe grew in the course\r\nof ages, as Atkinson showed convincingly in his _Primal Law_, by the\r\ngradual toleration by the Old Man of the existence of the younger men,\r\nand of their proprietorship in the wives they captured from outside the\r\ntribe, and in the tools and ornaments they made and the game they slew.\r\n Human society grew by a compromise between this one’s property and\r\nthat.  It was a compromise with instinct which was forced upon men by\r\nthe necessity of driving some other tribe out of its visible universe. \r\nIf the hills and forests and streams were not _your_ land or _my_ land,\r\nit was because they had to be our land.  Each of us would have\r\npreferred to have it _my_ land, but that would not work.  In that case\r\nthe other fellows would have destroyed us.  Society, therefore, is from\r\nits beginning a _mitigation of ownership_. Ownership in the beast and\r\nin the primitive savage was far more intense a thing than it is in the\r\ncivilized world to- day.  It is rooted more strongly in our instincts\r\nthan in our reason.\r\n\r\nIn the natural savage and in the untutored man to-day there is no\r\nlimitation to the sphere of ownership.  Whatever you can fight for, you\r\ncan own; women-folk, spared captive, captured beast, forest glade,\r\nstone-pit or what not.  As the community grew, a sort of law came to\r\nrestrain internecine fighting, men developed rough-and-ready methods of\r\nsettling proprietorship.  Men could own what they were the first to\r\nmake or capture or claim.  It seemed natural that a debtor who could\r\nnot pay should become the property of his creditor. Equally natural was\r\nit that after claiming a patch of land a man should exact payments from\r\nanyone who wanted to use it. It was only slowly, as the possibilities\r\nof organized life dawned on men, that this unlimited property in\r\nanything whatever began to be recognized as a nuisance.  Men found\r\nthemselves born into a universe all owned and claimed, nay! they found\r\nthemselves born owned and claimed.  The social struggles of the earlier\r\ncivilization are difficult to trace now, but the history we have told\r\nof the Roman Republic shows a community waking up to the idea that\r\ndebts may become a public inconvenience and should then be repudiated,\r\nand that the unlimited ownership of land is also an inconvenience.  We\r\nfind that later Babylonia severely limited the rights of property in\r\nslaves.  Finally, we find in the teaching of that great revolutionist,\r\nJesus of Nazareth, such an attack upon property as had never been\r\nbefore.  Easier it was, he said, for a camel to go through the eye of a\r\nneedle than for the owner of great possessions to enter the kingdom of\r\nheaven.  A steady, continuous criticism of the permissible scope of\r\nproperty seems to have been going on in the world for the last\r\ntwenty-five or thirty centuries.  Nineteen hundred years after Jesus of\r\nNazareth we find all the world that has come under the Christian\r\nteaching persuaded that there could be no property in human beings. \r\nAnd also the idea that a man may “do what he likes with his own” was\r\nvery much shaken in relation to other sorts of property.\r\n\r\nBut this world of the closing eighteenth century was still only in the\r\ninterrogative stage in this matter.  It had got nothing clear enough,\r\nmuch less settled enough, to act upon. One of its primary impulses was\r\nto protect property against the greed and waste of kings and the\r\nexploitation of noble adventurers.  It was largely to protect private\r\nproperty from taxation that the French Revolution began.  But the\r\nequalitarian formulæ of the Revolution carried it into a criticism of\r\nthe very property it had risen to protect.  How can men be free and\r\nequal when numbers of them have no ground to stand upon and nothing to\r\neat, and the owners will neither feed nor lodge them unless they toil? \r\nExcessively—the poor complained.\r\n\r\nTo which riddle the reply of one important political group was to set\r\nabout “dividing up.”  They wanted to intensify and universalize\r\nproperty.  Aiming at the same end by another route, there were the\r\nprimitive socialists—or, to be more exact, communists—who wanted to\r\n“abolish” private property altogether. The state (a democratic state\r\nwas of course understood) was to own all property.\r\n\r\nIt is paradoxical that different men seeking the same ends of liberty\r\nand happiness should propose on the one hand to make property as\r\nabsolute as possible, and on the other to put an end to it altogether. \r\nBut so it was.  And the clue to this paradox is to be found in the fact\r\nthat ownership is not one thing but a multitude of different things.\r\n\r\nIt was only as the nineteenth century developed that men began to\r\nrealize that property was not one simple thing, but a great complex of\r\nownerships of different values and consequences, that many things (such\r\nas one’s body, the implements of an artist, clothing, toothbrushes) are\r\nvery profoundly and incurably one’s personal property, and that there\r\nis a very great range of things, railways, machinery of various sorts,\r\nhomes, cultivated gardens, pleasure boats, for example, which need each\r\nto be considered very particularly to determine how far and under what\r\nlimitations it may come under private ownership, and how far it falls\r\ninto the public domain and may be administered and let out by the state\r\nin the collective interest.  On the practical side these questions pass\r\ninto politics, and the problem of making and sustaining efficient state\r\nadministration.  They open up issues in social psychology, and interact\r\nwith the enquiries of educational science.  The criticism of property\r\nis still a vast and passionate ferment rather than a science.  On the\r\none hand are the Individualists, who would protect and enlarge our\r\npresent freedoms with what we possess, and on the other the Socialists\r\nwho would in many directions pool our ownerships and restrain our\r\nproprietory acts.  In practice one will find every gradation between\r\nthe extreme individualist, who will scarcely tolerate a tax of any sort\r\nto support a government, and the communist who would deny any\r\npossessions at all.  The ordinary socialist of to-day is what is called\r\na collectivist; he would allow a considerable amount of private\r\nproperty but put such affairs as education, transport, mines,\r\nland-owning, most mass productions of staple articles, and the like,\r\ninto the hands of a highly organized state.  Nowadays there does seem\r\nto be a gradual convergence of reasonable men towards a moderate\r\nsocialism scientifically studied and planned.  It is realized more and\r\nmore clearly that the untutored man does not co-operate easily and\r\nsuccessfully in large undertakings, and that every step towards a more\r\ncomplex state and every function that the state takes over from private\r\nenterprise, necessitates a corresponding educational advance and the\r\norganization of a proper criticism and control.  Both the press and the\r\npolitical methods of the contemporary state are far too crude for any\r\nlarge extension of collective activities.\r\n\r\nBut for a time the stresses between employer and employed and\r\nparticularly between selfish employers and reluctant workers, led to a\r\nworld-wide dissemination of the very harsh and elementary form of\r\ncommunism which is associated with the name of Marx.  Marx based his\r\ntheories on a belief that men’s minds are limited by their economic\r\nnecessities, and that there is a necessary conflict of interests in our\r\npresent civilization between the prosperous and employing classes of\r\npeople and the employed mass.  With the advance in education\r\nnecessitated by the mechanical revolution, this great employed majority\r\nwill become more and more class-conscious and more and more solid in\r\nantagonism to the (class- conscious) ruling minority.  In some way the\r\nclass-conscious workers would seize power, he prophesied, and\r\ninaugurate a new social state.  The antagonism, the insurrection, the\r\npossible revolution are understandable enough, but it does not follow\r\nthat a new social state or anything but a socially destructive process\r\nwill ensue.  Put to the test in Russia, Marxism, as we shall note\r\nlater, has proved singularly uncreative.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENCE IN THE COAL MINE\r\nSCIENCE IN THE COAL MINE\r\n\r\nPortable Electric Loading Conveyor\r\n_Photo:  Jeffrey Manufacturing Company, Columbus, Ohio_\r\n\r\n\r\nMarx sought to replace national antagonism by class antagonisms;\r\nMarxism has produced in succession a First, a Second and a Third\r\nWorkers’ International.  But from the starting point of modern\r\nindividualistic thought it is also possible to reach international\r\nideas.  From the days of that great English economist, Adam Smith,\r\nonward there has been an increasing realization that for world-wide\r\nprosperity free and unencumbered trade about the earth is needed.  The\r\nindividualist with his hostility to the state is hostile also to\r\ntariffs and boundaries and all the restraints upon free act and\r\nmovement that national boundaries seem to justify. It is interesting to\r\nsee two lines of thought, so diverse in spirit, so different in\r\nsubstance as this class-war socialism of the Marxists and the\r\nindividualistic free-trading philosophy of the British business men of\r\nthe Victorian age heading at last, in spite of these primary\r\ndifferences, towards the same intimations of a new world-wide treatment\r\nof human affairs outside the boundaries and limitations of any existing\r\nstate.  The logic of reality triumphs over the logic of theory.  We\r\nbegin to perceive that from widely divergent starting points\r\nindividualist theory and socialist theory are part of a common search,\r\na search for more spacious social and political ideas and\r\ninterpretations, upon which men may contrive to work together, a search\r\nthat began again in Europe and has intensified as men’s confidence in\r\nthe ideas of the Holy Roman Empire and in Christendom decayed, and as\r\nthe age of discovery broadened their horizons from the world of the\r\nMediterranean to the whole wide world.\r\n\r\nTo bring this description of the elaboration and development of social,\r\neconomic and political ideas right down to the discussions of the\r\npresent day, would be to introduce issues altogether too controversial\r\nfor the scope and intentions of this book.  But regarding these things,\r\nas we do here, from the vast perspectives of the student of world\r\nhistory, we are bound to recognize that this reconstruction of these\r\ndirective ideas in the human mind is still an unfinished task—we cannot\r\neven estimate yet how unfinished the task may be.  Certain common\r\nbeliefs do seem to be emerging, and their influence is very perceptible\r\nupon the political events and public acts of to-day; but at present\r\nthey are not clear enough nor convincing enough to compel men\r\ndefinitely and systematically towards their realization.  Men’s acts\r\nwaver between tradition and the new, and on the whole they rather\r\ngravitate towards the traditional.  Yet, compared with the thought of\r\neven a brief lifetime ago, there does seem to be an outline shaping\r\nitself of a new order in human affairs.  It is a sketchy outline,\r\nvanishing into vagueness at this point and that, and fluctuating in\r\ndetail and formulæ, yet it grows steadfastly clearer, and its main\r\nlines change less and less.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTIONAL DETAIL OF THE FORTH BRIDGE\r\nCONSTRUCTIONAL DETAIL OF THE FORTH BRIDGE\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Baker & Hurtzig_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is becoming plainer and plainer each year that in many respects and\r\nin an increasing range of affairs, mankind is becoming one community,\r\nand that it is more and more necessary that in such matters there\r\nshould be a common world-wide control.  For example, it is steadily\r\ntruer that the whole planet is now one economic community, that the\r\nproper exploitation of its natural resources demands one comprehensive\r\ndirection, and that the greater power and range that discovery has\r\ngiven human effort makes the present fragmentary and contentious\r\nadministration of such affairs more and more wasteful and dangerous. \r\nFinancial and monetary expedients also become world-wide interests to\r\nbe dealt with successfully only on world-wide lines.  Infectious\r\ndiseases and the increase and migrations of population are also now\r\nplainly seen to be world-wide concerns.  The greater power and range of\r\nhuman activities has also made war disproportionately destructive and\r\ndisorganizing, and, even as a clumsy way of settling issues between\r\ngovernment and government and people and people, ineffective.  All\r\nthese things clamour for controls and authorities of a greater range\r\nand greater comprehensiveness than any government that has hitherto\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nBut it does not follow that the solution of these problems lies in some\r\nsuper-government of all the world arising by conquest or by the\r\ncoalescence of existing governments.  By analogy with existing\r\ninstitutions men have thought of the Parliament of Mankind, of a World\r\nCongress, of a President or Emperor of the Earth.  Our first natural\r\nreaction is towards some such conclusion, but the discussion and\r\nexperiences of half a century of suggestions and attempts has on the\r\nwhole discouraged belief in that first obvious idea.  Along that line\r\nto world unity the resistances are too great.  The drift of thought\r\nseems now to be in the direction of a number of special committees or\r\norganizations, with world-wide power delegated to them by existing\r\ngovernments in this group of matters or that, bodies concerned with the\r\nwaste or development of natural wealth, with the equalization of labour\r\nconditions, with world peace, with currency, population and health, and\r\nso forth.\r\n\r\nThe world may discover that all its common interests are being managed\r\nas one concern, while it still fails to realize that a world government\r\nexists.  But before even so much human unity is attained, before such\r\ninternational arrangements can be put above patriotic suspicions and\r\njealousies, it is necessary that the common mind of the race should be\r\npossessed of that idea of human unity, and that the idea of mankind as\r\none family should be a matter of universal instruction and\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nFor a score of centuries or more the spirit of the great universal\r\nreligions has been struggling to maintain and extend that idea of a\r\nuniversal human brotherhood, but to this day the spites, angers and\r\ndistrusts of tribal, national and racial friction obstruct, and\r\nsuccessfully obstruct, the broader views and more generous impulses\r\nwhich would make every man the servant of all mankind.  The idea of\r\nhuman brotherhood struggles now to possess the human soul, just as the\r\nidea of Christendom struggled to possess the soul of Europe in the\r\nconfusion and disorder of the sixth and seventh centuries of the\r\nChristian era.  The dissemination and triumph of such ideas must be the\r\nwork of a multitude of devoted and undistinguished missionaries, and no\r\ncontemporary writer can presume to guess how far such work has gone or\r\nwhat harvest it may be preparing.\r\n\r\nSocial and economic questions seem to be inseparably mingled with\r\ninternational ones.  The solution in each case lies in an appeal to\r\nthat same spirit of service which can enter and inspire the human\r\nheart.  The distrust, intractability and egotism of nations reflects\r\nand is reflected by the distrust, intractability and egotism of the\r\nindividual owner and worker in the face of the common good. \r\nExaggerations of possessiveness in the individual are parallel and of a\r\npiece with the clutching greed of nations and emperors.  They are\r\nproducts of the same instinctive tendencies, and the same ignorances\r\nand traditions.  Internationalism is the socialism of nations.  No one\r\nwho has wrestled with these problems can feel that there yet exists a\r\nsufficient depth and strength of psychological science and a\r\nsufficiently planned-out educational method and organization for any\r\nreal and final solution of these riddles of human intercourse and\r\ncooperation.  We are as incapable of planning a really effective peace\r\norganization of the world to-day as were men in 1820 to plan an\r\nelectric railway system, but for all we know the thing is equally\r\npracticable and may be as nearly at hand.\r\n\r\nNo man can go beyond his own knowledge, no thought can reach beyond\r\ncontemporary thought, and it is impossible for us to guess or foretell\r\nhow many generations of humanity may have to live in war and waste and\r\ninsecurity and misery before the dawn of the great peace to which all\r\nhistory seems to be pointing, peace in the heart and peace in the\r\nworld, ends our night of wasteful and aimless living.  Our proposed\r\nsolutions are still vague and crude.  Passion and suspicion surround\r\nthem.  A great task of intellectual reconstruction is going on, it is\r\nstill incomplete, and our conceptions grow clearer and more\r\nexact—slowly, rapidly, it is hard to tell which.  But as they grow\r\nclearer they will gather power over the minds and imaginations of men. \r\nTheir present lack of grip is due to their lack of assurance and exact\r\nrightness. They are misunderstood because they are variously and\r\nconfusingly presented.  But with precision and certainty the new vision\r\nof the world will gain compelling power.  It may presently gain power\r\nvery rapidly.  And a great work of educational reconstruction will\r\nfollow logically and necessarily upon that clearer understanding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLX\r\nTHE EXPANSION OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe region of the world that displayed the most immediate and striking\r\nresults from the new inventions in transport was North America.\r\nPolitically the United States embodied, and its constitution\r\ncrystallized, the liberal ideas of the middle eighteenth century. It\r\ndispensed with state-church or crown, it would have no titles, it\r\nprotected property very jealously as a method of freedom, and—the exact\r\npractice varied at first in the different states—it gave nearly every\r\nadult male citizen a vote. Its method of voting was barbarically crude,\r\nand as a consequence its political life fell very soon under the\r\ncontrol of highly organized party machines, but that did not prevent\r\nthe newly emancipated population developing an energy, enterprise and\r\npublic spirit far beyond that of any other contemporary population.\r\n\r\nThen came that acceleration of locomotion to which we have already\r\ncalled attention.  It is a curious thing that America, which owes most\r\nto this acceleration in locomotion, has felt it least.  The United\r\nStates have taken the railway, the river steamboat, the telegraph and\r\nso forth as though they were a natural part of their growth.  They were\r\nnot. These things happened to come along just in time to save American\r\nunity.  The United States of to-day were made first by the river\r\nsteamboat, and then by the railway.  Without these things, the present\r\nUnited States, this vast continental nation, would have been altogether\r\nimpossible. The westward flow of population would have been far more\r\nsluggish.  It might never have crossed the great central plains.  It\r\ntook nearly two hundred years for effective settlement to reach from\r\nthe coast to Missouri, much less than halfway across the continent. \r\nThe first state established beyond the river was the steamboat state of\r\nMissouri in 1821.  But the rest of the distance to the Pacific was done\r\nin a few decades.\r\n\r\nIf we had the resources of the cinema it would be interesting to show a\r\nmap of North America year by year from 1600 onward, with little dots to\r\nrepresent hundreds of people, each dot a hundred, and stars to\r\nrepresent cities of a hundred thousand people.\r\n\r\nFor two hundred years the reader would see that stippling creeping\r\nslowly along the coastal districts and navigable waters, spreading\r\nstill more gradually into Indiana, Kentucky and so forth.  Then\r\nsomewhere about 1810 would come a change. Things would get more lively\r\nalong the river courses.  The dots would be multiplying and spreading. \r\nThat would be the steamboat.  The pioneer dots would be spreading soon\r\nover Kansas and Nebraska from a number of jumping-off places along the\r\ngreat rivers.\r\n\r\nThen from about 1850 onward would come the black lines of the railways,\r\nand after that the little black dots would not simply creep but run. \r\nThey would appear now so rapidly, it would be almost as though they\r\nwere being put on by some sort of spraying machine.  And suddenly here\r\nand then there would appear the first stars to indicate the first great\r\ncities of a hundred thousand people.  First one or two and then a\r\nmultitude of cities—each like a knot in the growing net of the\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the United States is a process that has no precedent in\r\nthe world’s history; it is a new kind of occurrence.  Such a community\r\ncould not have come into existence before, and if it had, without\r\nrailways it would certainly have dropped to pieces long before now. \r\nWithout railways or telegraph it would be far easier to administer\r\nCalifornia from Pekin than from Washington.  But this great population\r\nof the United States of America has not only grown outrageously; it has\r\nkept uniform.  Nay, it has become more uniform.  The man of San\r\nFrancisco is more like the man of New York to-day than the man of\r\nVirginia was like the man of New England a century ago.  And the\r\nprocess of assimilation goes on unimpeded.  The United States is being\r\nwoven by railway, by telegraph, more and more into one vast unity,\r\nspeaking, thinking and acting harmoniously with itself.  Soon aviation\r\nwill be helping in the work.\r\n\r\nThis great community of the United States is an altogether new thing in\r\nhistory.  There have been great empires before with populations\r\nexceeding 100 millions, but these were associations of divergent\r\npeoples; there has never been one single people on this scale before. \r\nWe want a new term for this new thing.  We call the United States a\r\ncountry just as we call France or Holland a country.  But the two\r\nthings are as different as an automobile and a one-horse shay.  They\r\nare the creations of different periods and different conditions; they\r\nare going to work at a different pace and in an entirely different way.\r\n The United States in scale and possibility is halfway between a\r\nEuropean state and a United States of all the world.\r\n\r\nBut on the way to this present greatness and security the American\r\npeople passed through one phase of dire conflict. The river steamboats,\r\nthe railways, the telegraph, and their associate facilities, did not\r\ncome soon enough to avert a deepening conflict of interests and ideas\r\nbetween the southern and northern states of the Union.  The former were\r\nslave-holding states; the latter, states in which all men were free. \r\nThe railways and steamboats at first did but bring into sharper\r\nconflict an already established difference between the two sections of\r\nthe United States.  The increasing unification due to the new means of\r\ntransport made the question whether the southern spirit or the northern\r\nshould prevail an ever more urgent one.  There was little possibility\r\nof compromise.  The northern spirit was free and individualistic; the\r\nsouthern made for great estates and a conscious gentility ruling over a\r\ndusky subject multitude.\r\n\r\nEvery new territory that was organized into a state as the tide of\r\npopulation swept westward, every new incorporation into the fast\r\ngrowing American system, became a field of conflict between the two\r\nideas, whether it should become a state of free citizens, or whether\r\nthe estate and slavery system should prevail.  From 1833 an American\r\nanti-slavery society was not merely resisting the extension of the\r\ninstitution but agitating the whole country for its complete abolition.\r\n The issue flamed up into open conflict over the admission of Texas to\r\nthe Union.  Texas had originally been a part of the republic of Mexico,\r\nbut it was largely colonized by Americans from the slave-holding\r\nstates, and it seceded from Mexico, established its independence in\r\n1835, and was annexed to the United States in 1844.  Under the Mexican\r\nlaw slavery had been forbidden in Texas, but now the South claimed\r\nTexas for slavery and got it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the development of ocean navigation was bringing a growing\r\nswarm of immigrants from Europe to swell the spreading population of\r\nthe northern states, and the raising of Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota and\r\nOregon, all northern farm lands, to state level, gave the anti-slavery\r\nNorth the possibility of predominance both in the Senate and the House\r\nof Representatives.  The cotton- growing South, irritated by the\r\ngrowing threat of the Abolitionist movement, and fearing this\r\npredominance in Congress, began to talk of secession from the Union.\r\nSoutherners began to dream of annexations to the south of them in\r\nMexico and the West Indies, and of great slave state, detached from the\r\nNorth and reaching to Panama.\r\n\r\nThe return of Abraham Lincoln as an anti-extension President in 1860\r\ndecided the South to split the Union.  South Carolina passed an\r\n“ordinance of secession” and prepared for war.  Mississippi, Florida,\r\nAlabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas joined her, and a convention met\r\nat Montgomery in Alabama, elected Jefferson Davis president of the\r\n“Confederated States” of America, and adopted a constitution\r\nspecifically upholding “the institution of negro slavery.”\r\n\r\n\r\nONE OF THE FIRST AMERICAN RIVER STEAMERS\r\nONE OF THE FIRST AMERICAN RIVER STEAMERS\r\n\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln was, it chanced, a man entirely typical of the new\r\npeople that had grown up after the War of Independence.  His early\r\nyears had been spent as a drifting particle in the general westward\r\nflow of the population.  He was born in Kentucky (1809), was taken to\r\nIndiana as a boy and later on to Illinois.  Life was rough in the\r\nbackwoods of Indiana in those days; the house was a mere log cabin in\r\nthe wilderness, and his schooling was poor and casual.  But his mother\r\ntaught him to read early, and he became a voracious reader.  At\r\nseventeen he was a big athletic youth, a great wrestler and runner.  He\r\nworked for a time as clerk in a store, went into business as a\r\nstorekeeper with a drunken partner, and contracted debts that he did\r\nnot fully pay off for fifteen years.  In 1834, when he was still only\r\nfive and twenty, he was elected member of the House of Representatives\r\nfor the State of Illinois.  In Illinois particularly the question of\r\nslavery flamed because the great leader of the party for the extension\r\nof slavery in the national Congress was Senator Douglas of Illinois. \r\nDouglas was a man of great ability and prestige, and for some years\r\nLincoln fought against him by speech and pamphlet, rising steadily to\r\nthe position of his most formidable and finally victorious antagonist. \r\nTheir culminating struggle was the presidential campaign of 1860, and\r\non the fourth of March, 1861, Lincoln was inaugurated President, with\r\nthe southern states already in active secession from the rule of the\r\nfederal government at Washington, and committing acts of war.\r\n\r\nThis civil war in America was fought by improvised armies that grew\r\nsteadily from a few score thousands to hundreds of thousands—until at\r\nlast the Federal forces exceeded a million men; it was fought over a\r\nvast area between New Mexico and the eastern sea, Washington and\r\nRichmond were the chief objectives.  It is beyond our scope here to\r\ntell of the mounting energy of that epic struggle that rolled to and\r\nfro across the hills and woods of Tennessee and Virginia and down the\r\nMississippi.  There was a terrible waste and killing of men.  Thrust\r\nwas followed by counter thrust; hope gave way to despondency, and\r\nreturned and was again disappointed. Sometimes Washington seemed within\r\nthe Confederate grasp; again the Federal armies were driving towards\r\nRichmond.  The Confederates, outnumbered and far poorer in resources,\r\nfought under a general of supreme ability, General Lee.  The\r\ngeneralship of the Union was far inferior.  Generals were dismissed,\r\nnew generals appointed; until at last, under Sherman and Grant, came\r\nvictory over the ragged and depleted South.  In October, 1864, a\r\nFederal army under Sherman broke through the Confederate left and\r\nmarched down from Tennessee through Georgia to the coast, right across\r\nthe Confederate country, and then turned up through the Carolinas,\r\ncoming in upon the rear of the Confederate armies.  Meanwhile Grant\r\nheld Lee before Richmond until Sherman closed on him.  On April 9th,\r\n1865, Lee and his army surrendered at Appomattox Court House, and\r\nwithin a month all the remaining secessionist armies had laid down\r\ntheir arms and the Confederacy was at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\nThis four years’ struggle had meant an enormous physical and moral\r\nstrain for the people of the United States.  The principle of state\r\nautonomy was very dear to many minds, and the North seemed in effect to\r\nbe forcing abolition upon the South.  In the border states brothers and\r\ncousins, even fathers and sons, would take opposite sides and find\r\nthemselves in antagonistic armies.  The North felt its cause a\r\nrighteous one, but for great numbers of people it was not a full-bodied\r\nand unchallenged righteousness.  But for Lincoln there was no doubt. \r\nHe was a clear-minded man in the midst of much confusion.  He stood for\r\nunion; he stood for the wide peace of America.  He was opposed to\r\nslavery, but slavery he held to be a secondary issue; his primary\r\npurpose was that the United States should not be torn into two\r\ncontrasted and jarring fragments.\r\n\r\nWhen in the opening stages of the war Congress and the Federal generals\r\nembarked upon a precipitate emancipation, Lincoln opposed and mitigated\r\ntheir enthusiasm.  He was for emancipation by stages and with\r\ncompensation.  It was only in January, 1865, that the situation had\r\nripened to a point when Congress could propose to abolish slavery for\r\never by a constitutional amendment, and the war was already over before\r\nthis amendment was ratified by the states.\r\n\r\nAs the war dragged on through 1862 and 1863, the first passions and\r\nenthusiasms waned, and America learnt all the phases of war weariness\r\nand war disgust.  The President found himself with defeatists,\r\ntraitors, dismissed generals, tortuous party politicians, and a\r\ndoubting and fatigued people behind him and uninspired generals and\r\ndepressed troops before him; his chief consolation must have been that\r\nJefferson Davis at Richmond could be in little better case. The English\r\ngovernment misbehaved, and permitted the Confederate agents in England\r\nto launch and man three swift privateer ships—the _Alabama_ is the best\r\nremembered of them—which chased United States shipping from the seas. \r\nThe French army in Mexico was trampling the Monroe Doctrine in the\r\ndirt.  Came subtle proposals from Richmond to drop the war, leave the\r\nissues of the war for subsequent discussion, and turn, Federal and\r\nConfederate in alliance, upon the French in Mexico.  But Lincoln would\r\nnot listen to such proposals unless the supremacy of the Union was\r\nmaintained.  The Americans might do such things as one people but not\r\nas two.\r\n\r\nHe held the United States together through long weary months of\r\nreverses and ineffective effort, through black phases of division and\r\nfailing courage; and there is no record that he ever faltered from his\r\npurpose.  There were times when there was nothing to be done, when he\r\nsat in the White House silent and motionless, a grim monument of\r\nresolve; times when he relaxed his mind by jesting and broad anecdotes.\r\n\r\nHe saw the Union triumphant.  He entered Richmond the day after its\r\nsurrender, and heard of Lee’s capitulation. He returned to Washington,\r\nand on April 11th made his last public address.  His theme was\r\nreconciliation and the reconstruction of loyal government in the\r\ndefeated states. On the evening of April 14th he went to Ford’s theatre\r\nin Washington, and as he sat looking at the stage, he was shot in the\r\nback of the head and killed by an actor named Booth who had some sort\r\nof grievance against him, and who had crept into the box unobserved. \r\nBut Lincoln’s work was done; the Union was saved.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war there was no railway to the Pacific coast;\r\nafter it the railways spread like a swiftly growing plant until now\r\nthey have clutched and held and woven all the vast territory of the\r\nUnited States into one indissoluble mental and material unity—the\r\ngreatest real community—until the common folk of China have learnt to\r\nread—in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXI\r\nTHE RISE OF GERMANY TO PREDOMINANCE IN EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have told how after the convulsion of the French Revolution and the\r\nNapoleonic adventure, Europe settled down again for a time to an\r\ninsecure peace and a sort of modernized revival of the political\r\nconditions of fifty years before.  Until the middle of the century the\r\nnew facilities in the handling of steel and the railway and steamship\r\nproduced no marked political consequences.  But the social tension due\r\nto the development of urban industrialism grew. France remained a\r\nconspicuously uneasy country.  The revolution of 1830 was followed by\r\nanother in 1848.  Then Napoleon III, a nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte,\r\nbecame first President, and then (in 1852) Emperor.\r\n\r\nHe set about rebuilding Paris, and changed it from a picturesque\r\nseventeenth century insanitary city into the spacious Latinized city of\r\nmarble it is to-day.  He set about rebuilding France, and made it into\r\na brilliant-looking modernized imperialism.  He displayed a disposition\r\nto revive that competitiveness of the Great Powers which had kept\r\nEurope busy with futile wars during the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies.  The Tsar Nicholas I of Russia (1825- 1856) was also\r\nbecoming aggressive and pressing southward upon the Turkish Empire with\r\nhis eyes on Constantinople.\r\n\r\nAfter the turn of the century Europe broke out into a fresh cycle of\r\nwars.  They were chiefly “balance-of- power” and ascendancy wars. \r\nEngland, France and Sardinia assailed Russia in the Crimean war in\r\ndefence of Turkey; Prussia (with Italy as an ally) and Austria fought\r\nfor the leadership of Germany, France liberated North Italy from\r\nAustria at the price of Savoy, and Italy gradually unified itself into\r\none kingdom.  Then Napoleon III was so ill advised as to attempt\r\nadventures in Mexico, during the American Civil War; he set up an\r\nEmperor Maximilian there and abandoned him hastily to his fate—he was\r\nshot by the Mexicans—when the victorious Federal Government showed its\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap of Europe, 1848-1871\r\n\r\nIn 1870 came a long-pending struggle for predominance in Europe between\r\nFrance and Prussia.  Prussia had long foreseen and prepared for this\r\nstruggle, and France was rotten with financial corruption.  Her defeat\r\nwas swift and dramatic. The Germans invaded France in August, one great\r\nFrench army under the Emperor capitulated at Sedan in September,\r\nanother surrendered in October at Metz, and in January 1871, Paris,\r\nafter a siege and bombardment, fell into German hands.  Peace was\r\nsigned at Frankfort surrendering the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine\r\nto the Germans.  Germany, excluding Austria, was unified as an empire,\r\nand the King of Prussia was added to the galaxy of European Cæsars, as\r\nthe German Emperor.\r\n\r\nFor the next forty-three years Germany was the leading power upon the\r\nEuropean continent.  There was a Russo-Turkish war in 1877-8, but\r\nthereafter, except for certain readjustments in the Balkans, European\r\nfrontiers remained uneasily stable for thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXII\r\nTHE NEW OVERSEAS EMPIRES OF STEAMSHIP AND RAILWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe end of the eighteenth century was a period of disrupting empires\r\nand disillusioned expansionists. The long and tedious journey between\r\nBritain and Spain and their colonies in America prevented any really\r\nfree coming and going between the home land and the daughter lands, and\r\nso the colonies separated into new and distinct communities, with\r\ndistinctive ideas and interests and even modes of speech. As they grew\r\nthey strained more and more at the feeble and uncertain link of\r\nshipping that had joined them. Weak trading-posts in the wilderness,\r\nlike those of France in Canada, or trading establishments in great\r\nalien communities, like those of Britain in India, might well cling for\r\nbare existence to the nation which gave them support and a reason for\r\ntheir existence. That much and no more seemed to many thinkers in the\r\nearly part of the nineteenth century to be the limit set to overseas\r\nrule. In 1820 the sketchy great European “empires” outside of Europe\r\nthat had figured so bravely in the maps of the middle eighteenth\r\ncentury, had shrunken to very small dimensions. Only the Russian\r\nsprawled as large as ever across Asia.\r\n\r\nThe British Empire in 1815 consisted of the thinly populated coastal\r\nriver and lake regions of Canada, and a great hinterland of wilderness\r\nin which the only settlements as yet were the fur-trading stations of\r\nthe Hudson Bay Company, about a third of the Indian peninsula, under\r\nthe rule of the East India Company, the coast districts of the Cape of\r\nGood Hope inhabited by blacks and rebellious-spirited Dutch settlers; a\r\nfew trading stations on the coast of West Africa, the rock of\r\nGibraltar, the island of Malta, Jamaica, a few minor slave-labour\r\npossessions in the West Indies, British Guiana in South America, and,\r\non the other side of the world, two dumps for convicts at Botany Bay in\r\nAustralia and in Tasmania.  Spain retained Cuba and a few settlements\r\nin the Philippine Islands.  Portugal had in Africa some vestiges of her\r\nancient claims.  Holland had various islands and possessions in the\r\nEast Indies and Dutch Guiana, and Denmark an island or so in the West\r\nIndies.  France had one or two West Indian islands and French Guiana. \r\nThis seemed to be as much as the European powers needed, or were likely\r\nto acquire of the rest of the world.  Only the East India Company\r\nshowed any spirit of expansion.\r\n\r\nWhile Europe was busy with the Napoleonic wars the East India Company,\r\nunder a succession of Governors-General, was playing much the same role\r\nin India that had been played before by Turkoman and such-like invaders\r\nfrom the north.  And after the peace of Vienna it went on, levying its\r\nrevenues, making wars, sending ambassadors to Asiatic powers, a quasi-\r\nindependent state, however, with a marked disposition to send wealth\r\nwestward.\r\n\r\nWe cannot tell here in any detail how the British Company made its way\r\nto supremacy sometimes as the ally of this power, sometimes as that,\r\nand finally as the conqueror of all.  Its power spread to Assam, Sind,\r\nOudh.  The map of India began to take on the outlines familiar to the\r\nEnglish schoolboy of to-day, a patchwork of native states embraced and\r\nheld together by the great provinces under direct British rule. . . .\r\n\r\nIn 1859, following upon a serious mutiny of the native troops in India,\r\nthis empire of the East India Company was annexed to the British Crown.\r\n By an Act entitled _An Act for the Better Government of India_, the\r\nGovernor-General became a Viceroy representing the Sovereign, and the\r\nplace of the Company was taken by a Secretary of State for India\r\nresponsible to the British Parliament.  In 1877, Lord Beaconsfield, to\r\ncomplete the work, caused Queen Victoria to be proclaimed Empress of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nUpon these extraordinary lines India and Britain are linked at the\r\npresent time.  India is still the empire of the Great Mogul, but the\r\nGreat Mogul has been replaced by the “crowned republic” of Great\r\nBritain.  India is an autocracy without an autocrat.  Its rule combines\r\nthe disadvantage of absolute monarchy with the impersonality and\r\nirresponsibility of democratic officialdom.  The Indian with a\r\ncomplaint to make has no visible monarch to go to; his Emperor is a\r\ngolden symbol; he must circulate pamphlets in England or inspire a\r\nquestion in the British House of Commons.  The more occupied Parliament\r\nis with British affairs, the less attention India will receive, and the\r\nmore she will be at the mercy of her small group of higher officials.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILWAY BRIDGE OVER THE GORGE, VICTORIA FALLS, OF THE ZAMBESI, SOUTHERN\r\nRHODESIA\r\nRAILWAY BRIDGE OVER THE GORGE, VICTORIA FALLS, OF THE ZAMBESI, SOUTHERN\r\nRHODESIA\r\n\r\n_Photo:  British South African Co._\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from India, there was no great expansion of any European Empire\r\nuntil the railways and the steamships were in effective action.  A\r\nconsiderable school of political thinkers in Britain was disposed to\r\nregard overseas possessions as a source of weakness to the kingdom. \r\nThe Australian settlements developed slowly until in 1842 the discovery\r\nof valuable copper mines, and in 1851 of gold, gave them a new\r\nimportance.  Improvements in transport were also making Australian wool\r\nan increasingly marketable commodity in Europe.  Canada, too, was not\r\nremarkably progressive until 1849; it was troubled by dissensions\r\nbetween its French and British inhabitants, there were several serious\r\nrevolts, and it was only in 1867 that a new constitution creating a\r\nFederal Dominion of Canada relieved its internal strains.  It was the\r\nrailway that altered the Canadian outlook.  It enabled Canada, just as\r\nit enabled the United States, to expand westward, to market its corn\r\nand other produce in Europe, and in spite of its swift and extensive\r\ngrowth, to remain in language and sympathy and interests one community.\r\n The railway, the steamship and the telegraph cable were indeed\r\nchanging all the conditions of colonial development.\r\n\r\nBefore 1840, English settlements had already begun in New Zealand, and\r\na New Zealand Land Company had been formed to exploit the possibilities\r\nof the island.  In 1840 New Zealand also was added to the colonial\r\npossessions of the British Crown.\r\n\r\nCanada, as we have noted, was the first of the British possessions to\r\nrespond richly to the new economic possibilities that the new methods\r\nof transport were opening. Presently the republics of South America,\r\nand particularly the Argentine Republic, began to feel in their cattle\r\ntrade and coffee growing the increased nearness of the European market.\r\n Hitherto the chief commodities that had attracted the European powers\r\ninto unsettled and barbaric regions had been gold or other metals,\r\nspices, ivory, or slaves.  But in the latter quarter of the nineteenth\r\ncentury the increase of the European populations was obliging their\r\ngovernments to look abroad for staple foods; and the growth of\r\nscientific industrialism was creating a demand for new raw materials,\r\nfats and greases of every kind, rubber, and other hitherto disregarded\r\nsubstances.  It was plain that Great Britain and Holland and Portugal\r\nwere reaping a great and growing commercial advantage from their very\r\nconsiderable control of tropical and sub-tropical products.  After 1871\r\nGermany, and presently France and later Italy, began to look for\r\nunannexed raw-material areas, or for Oriental countries capable of\r\nprofitable modernization.\r\n\r\nSo began a fresh scramble all over the world, except in the American\r\nregion where the Monroe Doctrine now barred such adventures, for\r\npolitically unprotected lands.\r\n\r\nClose to Europe was the continent of Africa, full of vaguely known\r\npossibilities.  In 1850 it was a continent of black mystery; only Egypt\r\nand the coast were known.  Here we have no space to tell the amazing\r\nstory of the explorers and adventurers who first pierced the African\r\ndarkness, and of the political agents, administrators, traders,\r\nsettlers and scientific men who followed in their track.  Wonderful\r\nraces of men like the pygmies, strange beasts like the okapi,\r\nmarvellous fruits and flowers and insects, terrible diseases,\r\nastounding scenery of forest and mountain, enormous inland seas and\r\ngigantic rivers and cascades were revealed; a whole new world.  Even\r\nremains (at Zimbabwe) of some unrecorded and vanished civilization, the\r\nsouthward enterprise of an early people, were discovered. Into this new\r\nworld came the Europeans, and found the rifle already there in the\r\nhands of the Arab slave-traders, and negro life in disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: The British Empire in 1815\r\n\r\nBy 1900, in half a century, all Africa was mapped, explored, estimated\r\nand divided between the European powers.  Little heed was given to the\r\nwelfare of the natives in this scramble.  The Arab slaver was indeed\r\ncurbed rather than expelled, but the greed for rubber, which was a wild\r\nproduct collected under compulsion by the natives in the Belgian Congo,\r\na greed exacerbated by the clash of inexperienced European\r\nadministrators with the native population, led to horrible atrocities. \r\nNo European power has perfectly clean hands in this matter.\r\n\r\nWe cannot tell here in any detail how Great Britain got possession of\r\nEgypt in 1883 and remained there in spite of the fact that Egypt was\r\ntechnically a part of the Turkish Empire, nor how nearly this scramble\r\nled to war between France and Great Britain in 1898, when a certain\r\nColonel Marchand, crossing Central Africa from the west coast, tried at\r\nFashoda to seize the Upper Nile.\r\n\r\nNor can we tell how the British Government first let the Boers, or\r\nDutch settlers, of the Orange River district and the Transvaal set up\r\nindependent republics in the inland parts of South Africa, and then\r\nrepented and annexed the Transvaal Republic in 1877; nor how the\r\nTransvaal Boers fought for freedom and won it after the battle of\r\nMajuba Hill (1881).  Majuba Hill was made to rankle in the memory of\r\nthe English people by a persistent press campaign.  A war with both\r\nrepublics broke out in 1899, a three years’ war enormously costly to\r\nthe British people, which ended at last in the surrender of the two\r\nrepublics.\r\n\r\nTheir period of subjugation was a brief one.  In 1907, after the\r\ndownfall of the imperialist government which had conquered them, the\r\nLiberals took the South African problem in hand, and these former\r\nrepublics became free and fairly willing associates with Cape Colony\r\nand  Natal in a Confederation of all the states of South Africa as one\r\nself- governing republic under the British Crown.\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of a century the partition of Africa was completed.  There\r\nremained unannexed three comparatively small countries: Liberia, a\r\nsettlement of liberated negro slaves on the west coast; Morocco, under\r\na Moslem Sultan; and Abyssinia, a barbaric country, with an ancient and\r\npeculiar form of Christianity, which had successfully maintained its\r\nindependence against Italy at the battle of Adowa in 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIII\r\nEUROPEAN AGGRESSION IN ASIA AND THE RISE OF JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to believe that any large number of people really\r\naccepted this headlong painting of the map of Africa in European\r\ncolours as a permanent new settlement of the worlds affairs, but it is\r\nthe duty of the historian to record that it was so accepted. There was\r\nbut a shallow historical background to the European mind in the\r\nnineteenth century, and no habit of penetrating criticism. The quite\r\ntemporary advantages that the mechanical revolution in the west had\r\ngiven the Europeans over the rest of the old world were regarded by\r\npeople, blankly ignorant of such events as the great Mongol conquests,\r\nas evidences of a permanent and assured European leadership of mankind.\r\nThey had no sense of the transferability of science and its fruits.\r\nThey did not realize that Chinamen and Indians could carry on the work\r\nof research as ably as Frenchmen or Englishmen. They believed that\r\nthere was some innate intellectual drive in the west, and some innate\r\nindolence and conservatism in the east, that assured the Europeans a\r\nworld predominance for ever.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this infatuation was that the various European\r\nforeign offices set themselves not merely to scramble with the British\r\nfor the savage and undeveloped regions of the world’s surface, but also\r\nto carve up the populous and civilized countries of Asia as though\r\nthese people also were no more than raw material for exploitation. The\r\ninwardly precarious but outwardly splendid imperialism of the British\r\nruling class in India, and the extensive and profitable possessions of\r\nthe Dutch in the East Indies, filled the rival Great Powers with dreams\r\nof similar glories in Persia, in the disintegrating Ottoman Empire, and\r\nin Further India, China and Japan.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 Germany seized Kiau Chau in China.  Britain responded by\r\nseizing Wei-hai-wei, and the next year the Russians took possession of\r\nPort Arthur.  A flame of hatred for the Europeans swept through China. \r\nThere were massacres of Europeans and Christian converts, and in 1900\r\nan attack upon and siege of the European legations in Pekin.  A\r\ncombined force of Europeans made a punitive expedition to Pekin,\r\nrescued the legations, and stole an enormous amount of valuable\r\nproperty.  The Russians then seized Manchuria, and in 1904, the British\r\ninvaded Tibet....\r\n\r\nBut now a new Power appeared in the struggle of the Great Powers,\r\nJapan.  Hitherto Japan has played but a small part in this history; her\r\nsecluded civilization has not contributed very largely to the general\r\nshaping of human destinies; she has received much, but she has given\r\nlittle.  The Japanese proper are of the Mongolian race.  Their\r\ncivilization, their writing and their literary and artistic traditions\r\nare derived from the Chinese.  Their history is an interesting and\r\nromantic one; they developed a feudal system and a system of chivalry\r\nin the earlier centuries of the Christian era; their attacks upon Korea\r\nand China are an Eastern equivalent of the English wars in France. \r\nJapan was first brought into contact with Europe in the sixteenth\r\ncentury; in 1542 some Portuguese reached it in a Chinese junk, and in\r\n1549 a Jesuit missionary, Francis Xavier, began his teaching there. \r\nFor a time Japan welcomed European intercourse, and the Christian\r\nmissionaries made a great number of converts.  A certain William Adams\r\nbecame the most trusted European adviser of the Japanese, and showed\r\nthem how to build big ships.  There were voyages in Japanese-built\r\nships to India and Peru.  Then arose complicated quarrels between the\r\nSpanish Dominicans, the Portuguese Jesuits, and the English and Dutch\r\nProtestants, each warning the Japanese against the political designs of\r\nthe others.  The Jesuits, in a phase of ascendancy, persecuted and\r\ninsulted the Buddhists with great acrimony.  In the end the Japanese\r\ncame to the conclusion that the Europeans were an intolerable nuisance,\r\nand that Catholic Christianity in particular was a mere cloak for the\r\npolitical dreams of the Pope and the Spanish monarchy—already in\r\npossession of the Philippine Islands; there was a great persecution of\r\nthe Christians, and in 1638 Japan was absolutely closed to Europeans,\r\nand remained closed for over 200 years.  During those two centuries the\r\nJapanese were as completely cut off from the rest of the world as\r\nthough they lived upon another planet.  It was forbidden to build any\r\nship larger than a mere coasting boat. No Japanese could go abroad, and\r\nno European enter the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPANESE SOLDIER ON THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\nJAPANESE SOLDIER ON THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n_(In the Victoria and Albert Museum)_\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two centuries Japan remained outside the main current of history. \r\nShe lived on in a state of picturesque feudalism in which about five\r\nper cent of the population, the _samurai_, or fighting men, and the\r\nnobles and their families, tyrannized without restraint over the rest\r\nof the population.  Meanwhile the great world outside went on to wider\r\nvisions and new powers.  Strange shipping became more frequent, passing\r\nthe Japanese headlands; sometimes ships were wrecked and sailors\r\nbrought ashore.  Through the Dutch settlement in the island of Deshima,\r\ntheir one link with the outer universe, came warnings that Japan was\r\nnot keeping pace with the power of the Western world.  In 1837 a ship\r\nsailed into Yedo Bay flying a strange flag of stripes and stars, and\r\ncarrying some Japanese sailors she had picked up far adrift in the\r\nPacific.  She was driven off by cannon shot.  This flag presently\r\nreappeared on other ships.  One in 1849 came to demand the liberation\r\nof eighteen shipwrecked American sailors.  Then in 1853 came four\r\nAmerican warships under Commodore Perry, and refused to be driven away.\r\n He lay at anchor in forbidden waters, and sent messages to the two\r\nrulers who at that time shared the control of Japan.  In 1854 he\r\nreturned with ten ships, amazing ships propelled by steam, and equipped\r\nwith big guns, and he made proposals for trade and intercourse that the\r\nJapanese had no power to resist.  He landed with a guard of 500 men to\r\nsign the treaty. Incredulous crowds watched this visitation from the\r\nouter world, marching through the streets.\r\n\r\nRussia, Holland and Britain followed in the wake of America. A great\r\nnobleman whose estates commanded the Straits of Shimonoseki saw fit to\r\nfire on foreign vessels, and a bombardment by a fleet of British,\r\nFrench, Dutch and American warships destroyed his batteries and\r\nscattered his swordsmen. Finally an allied squadron (1865), at anchor\r\noff Kioto, imposed a ratification of the treaties which opened Japan to\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe humiliation of the Japanese by these events was intense. With\r\nastonishing energy and intelligence they set themselves to bring their\r\nculture and organization to the level of the European Powers.  Never in\r\nall the history of mankind did a nation make such a stride as Japan\r\nthen did.  In 1866 she was a medieval people, a fantastic caricature of\r\nthe extremest romantic feudalism; in 1899 hers was a completely\r\nWesternized people, on a level with the most advanced European Powers.\r\nShe completely dispelled the persuasion that Asia was in some\r\nirrevocable way hopelessly behind Europe.  She made all European\r\nprogress seem sluggish by comparison.\r\n\r\nWe cannot tell here in any detail of Japan’s war with China in 1894-95.\r\n It demonstrated the extent of her Westernization.  She had an\r\nefficient Westernized army and a small but sound fleet.  But the\r\nsignificance of her renascence, though it was appreciated by Britain\r\nand the United States, who were already treating her as if she were a\r\nEuropean state, was not understood by the other Great Powers engaged in\r\nthe pursuit of new Indias in Asia.  Russia was pushing down through\r\nManchuria to Korea.  France was already established far to the south in\r\nTonkin and Annam, Germany was prowling hungrily on the look-out for\r\nsome settlement.  The three Powers combined to prevent Japan reaping\r\nany fruits from the Chinese war.  She was exhausted by the struggle,\r\nand they threatened her with war.\r\n\r\n\r\nA STREET IN TOKIO\r\nA STREET IN TOKIO\r\n\r\n\r\nJapan submitted for a time and gathered her forces.  Within ten years\r\nshe was ready for a struggle with Russia, which marks an epoch in the\r\nhistory of Asia, the close of the period of European arrogance.  The\r\nRussian people were, of course, innocent and ignorant of this trouble\r\nthat was being made for them halfway round the world, and the wiser\r\nRussian statesmen were against these foolish thrusts; but a gang of\r\nfinancial adventurers, including the Grand Dukes, his cousins,\r\nsurrounded the Tsar.  They had gambled deeply in the prospective\r\nlooting of Manchuria and China, and they would suffer no withdrawal. \r\nSo there began a transportation of great armies of Japanese soldiers\r\nacross the sea to Port Arthur and Korea, and the sending of endless\r\ntrainloads of Russian peasants along the Siberian railway to die in\r\nthose distant battlefields.\r\n\r\nThe Russians, badly led and dishonestly provided, were beaten on sea\r\nand land alike.  The Russian Baltic Fleet sailed round Africa to be\r\nutterly destroyed in the Straits of Tshushima. A revolutionary movement\r\namong the common people of Russia, infuriated by this remote and\r\nreasonless slaughter, obliged the Tsar to end the war (1905); he\r\nreturned the southern half of Saghalien, which had been seized by\r\nRussia in 1875, evacuated Manchuria, resigned Korea to Japan.  The\r\nEuropean invasion of Asia was coming to an end and the retraction of\r\nEurope’s tentacles was beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIV\r\nTHE BRITISH EMPIRE IN 1914\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may note here briefly the varied nature of the constituents of the\r\nBritish Empire in 1914 which the steamship and railway had brought\r\ntogether. It was and is a quite unique political combination; nothing\r\nof the sort has ever existed before.\r\n\r\nFirst and central to the whole system was the “crowned republic” of the\r\nUnited British Kingdom, including (against the will of a considerable\r\npart of the Irish people) Ireland.  The majority of the British\r\nParliament, made up of the three united parliaments of England and\r\nWales, Scotland and Ireland, determines the headship, the quality and\r\npolicy of the ministry, and determines it largely on considerations\r\narising out of British domestic politics.  It is this ministry which is\r\nthe effective supreme government, with powers of peace and war, over\r\nall the rest of the empire.\r\n\r\nNext in order of political importance to the British States were the\r\n“crowned republics” of Australia, Canada, Newfoundland (the oldest\r\nBritish possession, 1583), New Zealand and South Africa, all\r\npractically independent and self-governing states in alliance with\r\nGreat Britain, but each with a representative of the Crown appointed by\r\nthe Government in office;\r\n\r\nNext the Indian Empire, an extension of the Empire of the Great Mogul\r\nwith its dependent and “protected” states reaching now from Beluchistan\r\nto Burma, and including Aden, in all of which empire the British Crown\r\nand the India Office (under Parliamentary control) played the role of\r\nthe original Turkoman dynasty;\r\n\r\nThen the ambiguous possession of Egypt, still nominally a part of the\r\nTurkish Empire and still retaining its own monarch, the Khedive, but\r\nunder almost despotic British official rule;\r\n\r\n\r\nMap: OVERSEAS EMPIRES of EUROPEAN POWERS, January 1914\r\n\r\nThen the still more ambiguous “Anglo-Egyptian” Sudan province, occupied\r\nand administered jointly by the British and by the (British controlled)\r\nEgyptian Government;\r\n\r\nThen a number of partially self-governing communities, some British in\r\norigin and some not, with elected legislatures and an appointed\r\nexecutive, such as Malta, Jamaica, the Bahamas and Bermuda;\r\n\r\nThen the Crown colonies, in which the rule of the British Home\r\nGovernment (through the Colonial Office) verged on autocracy, as in\r\nCeylon, Trinidad and Fiji (where there was an appointed council), and\r\nGibraltar and St. Helena (where there was a governor);\r\n\r\n\r\nGIBRALTAR\r\nGIBRALTAR\r\n\r\n_Photo:  C. Sinclair_\r\n\r\n\r\nThen great areas of (chiefly) tropical lands, raw-product areas, with\r\npolitically weak and under-civilized native communities which were\r\nnominally protectorates, and administered either by a High Commissioner\r\nset over native chiefs (as in Basutoland) or over a chartered company\r\n(as in Rhodesia).  In some cases the Foreign Office, in some cases the\r\nColonial Office, and in some cases the India Office, has been concerned\r\nin acquiring the possessions that fell into this last and least\r\ndefinite class of all, but for the most part the Colonial Office was\r\nnow responsible for them.\r\n\r\nIt will be manifest, therefore, that no single office and no single\r\nbrain had ever comprehended the British Empire as a whole.  It was a\r\nmixture of growths and accumulations entirely different from anything\r\nthat has ever been called an empire before.  It guaranteed a wide peace\r\nand security; that is why it was endured and sustained by many men of\r\nthe “subject” races—in spite of official tyrannies and insufficiencies,\r\nand of much negligence on the part of the “home” public. Like the\r\nAthenian Empire, it was an overseas empire; its ways were sea ways, and\r\nits common link was the British Navy. Like all empires, its cohesion\r\nwas dependent physically upon a method of communication; the\r\ndevelopment of seamanship, ship-building and steamships between the\r\nsixteenth and nineteenth centuries had made it a possible and\r\nconvenient Pax—the “Pax Britannica,” and fresh developments of air or\r\nswift land transport might at any time make it inconvenient.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTREET IN HONG KONG\r\nSTREET IN HONG KONG\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Underwood & Underwood_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXV\r\nTHE AGE OF ARMAMENT IN EUROPE, AND THE GREAT WAR OF 1914-18\r\n\r\n\r\nThe progress in material science that created this vast\r\nsteamboat-and-railway republic of America and spread this precarious\r\nBritish steamship empire over the world, produced quite other effects\r\nupon the congested nations upon the continent of Europe. They found\r\nthemselves confined within boundaries fixed during the\r\nhorse-and-high-road period of human life, and their expansion overseas\r\nhad been very largely anticipated by Great Britain. Only Russia had any\r\nfreedom to expand eastward; and she drove a great railway across\r\nSiberia until she entangled herself in a conflict with Japan, and\r\npushed south-eastwardly towards the borders of Persia and India to the\r\nannoyance of Britain. The rest of the European Powers were in a state\r\nof intensifying congestion. In order to realize the full possibilities\r\nof the new apparatus of human life they had to rearrange their affairs\r\nupon a broader basis, either by some sort of voluntary union or by a\r\nunion imposed upon them by some predominant power. The tendency of\r\nmodern thought was in the direction of the former alternative, but all\r\nthe force of political tradition drove Europe towards the latter.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of the “empire” of Napoleon III, the establishment of the\r\nnew German Empire, pointed men’s hopes and fears towards the idea of a\r\nEurope consolidated under German auspices.  For thirty-six years of\r\nuneasy peace the polities of Europe centred upon that possibility.\r\nFrance, the steadfast rival of Germany for European ascendancy since\r\nthe division of the empire of Charlemagne, sought to correct her own\r\nweakness by a close alliance with Russia, and Germany linked herself\r\nclosely with the Austrian Empire (it had ceased to be the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire in the days of Napoleon I) and less successfully with the new\r\nkingdom of Italy.  At first Great Britain stood as usual half in and\r\nhalf out of continental affairs.  But she was gradually forced into a\r\nclose association with the Franco-Russian group by the aggressive\r\ndevelopment of a great German navy.  The grandiose imagination of the\r\nEmperor William II (1888-1918) thrust Germany into premature overseas\r\nenterprise that ultimately brought not only Great Britain but Japan and\r\nthe United States into the circle of her enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH TANK IN THE BATTLE OF THE MENIN ROAD\r\nBRITISH TANK IN THE BATTLE OF THE MENIN ROAD\r\nThe crew came out for a breath of fresh air during a lull\r\n\r\n_Photo:  British Official_\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these nations armed.  Year after year the proportion of national\r\nproduction devoted to the making of guns, equipment, battleships and\r\nthe like, increased. Year after year the balance of things seemed\r\ntrembling towards war, and then war would be averted.  At last it came.\r\nGermany and Austria struck at France and Russia and Serbia; the German\r\narmies marching through Belgium, Britain immediately came into the war\r\non the side of Belgium, bringing in Japan as her ally, and very soon\r\nTurkey followed on the German side.  Italy entered the war against\r\nAustria in 1915, and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers in the October\r\nof that year.  In 1916 Rumania, and in 1917 the United States and China\r\nwere forced into war against Germany.  It is not within the scope of\r\nthis history to define the exact share of blame for this vast\r\ncatastrophe.  The more interesting question is not why the Great War\r\nwas begun but why the Great War was not anticipated and prevented.  It\r\nis a far graver thing for mankind that scores of millions of people\r\nwere too “patriotic,” stupid, or apathetic to prevent this disaster by\r\na movement towards European unity upon frank and generous lines, than\r\nthat a small number of people may have been active in bringing it\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUINS OF YPRES (ONCE A DELIGHTFUL OLD FLEMISH TOWN)\r\nTHE RUINS OF YPRES (ONCE A DELIGHTFUL OLD FLEMISH TOWN)\r\nTo show the complete destructiveness of modern war\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Topical_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVASTATION OF MODERN WAR\r\nTHE DEVASTATION OF MODERN WAR\r\nWire entanglements in the foreground\r\n\r\n_Photo:  Photopress_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible within the space at our command here to trace the\r\nintricate details of the war.  Within a few months it became apparent\r\nthat the progress of modern technical science had changed the nature of\r\nwarfare very profoundly.  Physical science gives power, power over\r\nsteel, over distance, over disease; whether that power is used well or\r\nill depends upon the moral and political intelligence of the world. \r\nThe governments of Europe, inspired by antiquated policies of hate and\r\nsuspicion, found themselves with unexampled powers both of destruction\r\nand resistance in their hands.  The war became a consuming fire round\r\nand about the world, causing losses both to victors and vanquished out\r\nof all proportion to the issues involved.  The first phase of the war\r\nwas a tremendous rush of the Germans upon Paris and an invasion of East\r\nPrussia by the Russians.  Both attacks were held and turned.  Then the\r\npower of the defensive developed; there was a rapid elaboration of\r\ntrench warfare until for a time the opposing armies lay entrenched in\r\nlong lines right across Europe, unable to make any advance without\r\nenormous losses.  The armies were millions strong, and behind them\r\nentire populations were organized for the supply of food and munitions\r\nto the front.  Then was a cessation of nearly every sort of productive\r\nactivity except such as contributed to military operations.  All the\r\nable-bodied manhood of Europe was drawn into the armies or navies or\r\ninto the improvised factories that served them.  There was an enormous\r\nreplacement of men by women in industry. Probably more than half the\r\npeople in the belligerent countries of Europe changed their employment\r\naltogether during this stupendous struggle.  They were socially\r\nuprooted and transplanted.  Education and normal scientific work were\r\nrestricted or diverted to immediate military ends, and the distribution\r\nof news was crippled and corrupted by military control and “propaganda”\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nThe phase of military deadlock passed slowly into one of aggression\r\nupon the combatant populations behind the fronts by the destruction of\r\nfood supplies and by attacks through the air.  And also there was a\r\nsteady improvement in the size and range of the guns employed and of\r\nsuch ingenious devices as poison-gas shells and the small mobile forts\r\nknown as tanks, to break down the resistance of troops in the trenches.\r\n The air offensive was the most revolutionary of all the new methods. \r\nIt carried warfare from two dimensions into three.  Hitherto in the\r\nhistory of mankind war had gone on only where the armies marched and\r\nmet.  Now it went on everywhere.  First the Zeppelin and then the\r\nbombing aeroplane carried war over and past the front to an ever-\r\nincreasing area of civilian activities beyond.  The old distinction\r\nmaintained in civilized warfare between the civilian and combatant\r\npopulation disappeared.  Everyone who grew food, or who sewed a\r\ngarment, everyone who felled a tree or repaired a house, every railway\r\nstation and every warehouse was held to be fair game for destruction. \r\nThe air offensive increased in range and terror with every month in the\r\nwar.  At last great areas of Europe were in a state of siege and\r\nsubject to nightly raids.  Such exposed cities as London and Paris\r\npassed sleepless night after sleepless night while the bombs burst, the\r\nanti-aircraft guns maintained an intolerable racket, and the fire\r\nengines and ambulances rattled headlong through the darkened and\r\ndeserted streets. The effects upon the minds and health of old people\r\nand of young children were particularly distressing and destructive.\r\n\r\nPestilence, that old follower of warfare, did not arrive until the very\r\nend of the fighting in 1918.  For four years medical science staved off\r\nany general epidemic; then came a great outbreak of influenza about the\r\nworld which destroyed many millions of people.  Famine also was staved\r\noff for some time.  By the beginning of 1918 however most of Europe was\r\nin a state of mitigated and regulated famine.  The production of food\r\nthroughout the world had fallen very greatly through the calling off of\r\npeasant mankind to the fronts, and the distribution of such food as was\r\nproduced was impeded by the havoc wrought by the submarine, by the\r\nrupture of customary routes through the closing of frontiers, and by\r\nthe disorganization of the transport system of the world. The various\r\ngovernments took possession of the dwindling food supplies, and, with\r\nmore or less success, rationed their populations.  By the fourth year\r\nthe whole world was suffering from shortages of clothing and housing\r\nand of most of the normal gear of life as well as of food.  Business\r\nand economic life were profoundly disorganized.  Every-one was worried,\r\nand most people were leading lives of unwonted discomfort.\r\n\r\nThe actual warfare ceased in November, 1918.  After a supreme effort in\r\nthe spring of 1918 that almost carried the Germans to Paris, the\r\nCentral Powers collapsed.  They had come to an end of their spirit and\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVI\r\nTHE REVOLUTION AND FAMINE IN RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a good year and more before the collapse of the Central Powers the\r\nhalf oriental monarchy of Russia, which had professed to be the\r\ncontinuation of the Byzantine Empire, had collapsed. The Tsardom had\r\nbeen showing signs of profound rottenness for some years before the\r\nwar; the court was under the sway of a fantastic religious impostor,\r\nRasputin, and the public administration, civil and military, was in a\r\nstate of extreme inefficiency and corruption. At the outset of the war\r\nthere was a great flare of patriotic enthusiasm in Russia. A vast\r\nconscript army was called up, for which there was neither adequate\r\nmilitary equipment nor a proper supply of competent officers, and this\r\ngreat host, ill supplied and badly handled, was hurled against the\r\nGerman and Austrian frontiers.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the early appearance of Russian armies in\r\nEast Prussia in September, 1914, diverted the energies and attention of\r\nthe Germans from their first victorious drive upon Paris.  The\r\nsufferings and deaths of scores of thousands of ill-led Russian\r\npeasants saved France from complete overthrow in that momentous opening\r\ncampaign, and made all western Europe the debtors of that great and\r\ntragic people.  But the strain of the war upon this sprawling,\r\nill-organized empire was too heavy for its strength.  The Russian\r\ncommon soldiers were sent into battle without guns to support them,\r\nwithout even rifle ammunition; they were wasted by their officers and\r\ngenerals in a delirium of militarist enthusiasm.  For a time they\r\nseemed to be suffering mutely as the beasts suffer; but there is a\r\nlimit to the endurance even of the most ignorant.  A profound disgust\r\nfor Tsardom was creeping through these armies of betrayed and wasted\r\nmen.  From the close of 1915 onward Russia was a source of deepening\r\nanxiety to her Western Allies.  Throughout 1916 she remained largely on\r\nthe defensive, and there were rumours of a separate peace with Germany.\r\n\r\nOn December 29th, 1916, the monk Rasputin was murdered at a dinner\r\nparty in Petrograd, and a belated attempt was made to put the Tsardom\r\nin order.  By March things were moving rapidly; food riots in Petrograd\r\ndeveloped into a revolutionary insurrection; there was an attempted\r\nsuppression of the Duma, the representative body, there were attempted\r\narrests of liberal leaders, the formation of a provisional government\r\nunder Prince Lvoff, and an abdication (March 15th) by the Tsar.  For a\r\ntime it seemed that a moderate and controlled revolution might be\r\npossible—perhaps under a new Tsar.  Then it became evident that the\r\ndestruction of popular confidence in Russia had gone too far for any\r\nsuch adjustments. The Russian people were sick to death of the old\r\norder of things in Europe, of Tsars and wars and of Great Powers; it\r\nwanted relief, and that speedily, from unendurable miseries.  The\r\nAllies had no understanding of Russian realities; their diplomatists\r\nwere ignorant of Russian, genteel persons with their attention directed\r\nto the Russian Court rather than to Russia, they blundered steadily\r\nwith the new situation.  There was little goodwill among these\r\ndiplomatists for republicanism, and a manifest disposition to embarrass\r\nthe new government as much as possible.  At the head of the Russian\r\nrepublican government was an eloquent and picturesque leader, Kerensky,\r\nwho found himself assailed by the forces of a profounder revolutionary\r\nmovement, the “social revolution,” at home and cold-shouldered by the\r\nAllied governments abroad.  His Allies would neither let him give the\r\nRussian peasants the land for which they craved nor peace beyond their\r\nfrontiers.  The French and the British press pestered their exhausted\r\nally for a fresh offensive, but when presently the Germans made a\r\nstrong attack by sea and land upon Riga, the British Admiralty quailed\r\nbefore the prospect of a Baltic expedition in relief.  The new Russian\r\nRepublic had to fight unsupported.  In spite of their naval\r\npredominance and the bitter protests of the great English admiral, Lord\r\nFisher (1841-1920), it is to be noted that the British and their\r\nAllies, except for some submarine attacks, left the Germans the\r\ncomplete mastery of the Baltic throughout the war.\r\n\r\nThe Russian masses, however, were resolute to end the war.  At any\r\ncost.  There had come into existence in Petrograd a body representing\r\nthe workers and common soldiers, the Soviet, and this body clamoured\r\nfor an international conference of socialists at Stockholm.  Food riots\r\nwere occurring in Berlin at this time, war weariness in Austria and\r\nGermany was profound, and there can be little doubt, in the light of\r\nsubsequent events, that such a conference would have precipitated a\r\nreasonable peace on democratic lines in 1917 and a German revolution. \r\nKerensky implored his Western allies to allow this conference to take\r\nplace, but, fearful of a worldwide outbreak of socialism and\r\nrepublicanism, they refused, in spite of the favourable response of a\r\nsmall majority of the British Labour Party.  Without either moral or\r\nphysical help from the Allies, the unhappy “moderate” Russian Republic\r\nstill fought on and made a last desperate offensive effort in July.  It\r\nfailed after some preliminary successes, and there came another great\r\nslaughtering of Russians.\r\n\r\nThe limit of Russian endurance was reached.  Mutinies broke out in the\r\nRussian armies, and particularly upon the northern front, and on\r\nNovember 7th, 1917, Kerensky’s government was overthrown and power was\r\nseized by the Soviets, dominated by the Bolshevik socialists under\r\nLenin, and pledged to make peace regardless of the Western powers.  On\r\nMarch 2nd, 1918, a separate peace between Russia and Germany was signed\r\nat Brest-Litovsk.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VIEW IN PETERSBURG UNDER BOLSHEVIK RULE\r\nA VIEW IN PETERSBURG UNDER BOLSHEVIK RULE\r\nA wooden house has been demolished for firewood\r\n\r\n_By courtesy of Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt speedily became evident that these Bolshevik socialists were men of\r\na very different quality from the rhetorical constitutionalists and\r\nrevolutionaries of the Kerensky phase.  They were fanatical Marxist\r\ncommunists.  They believed that their accession to power in Russia was\r\nonly the opening of a world-wide social revolution, and they set about\r\nchanging the social and economic order with the thoroughness of perfect\r\nfaith and absolute inexperience.  The western European and the American\r\ngovernments were themselves much too ill-informed and incapable to\r\nguide or help this extraordinary experiment, and the press set itself\r\nto discredit and the ruling classes to wreck these usurpers upon any\r\nterms and at any cost to themselves or to Russia.  A propaganda of\r\nabominable and disgusting inventions went on unchecked in the press of\r\nthe world; the Bolshevik leaders were represented as incredible\r\nmonsters glutted with blood and plunder and living lives of sensuality\r\nbefore which the realities of the Tsarist court during the Rasputin\r\nregime paled to a white purity.  Expeditions were launched at the\r\nexhausted country, insurgents and raiders were encouraged, armed and\r\nsubsidized, and no method of attack was too mean or too monstrous for\r\nthe frightened enemies of the Bolshevik regime.  In 1919, the Russian\r\nBolsheviks, ruling a country already exhausted and disorganized by five\r\nyears of intensive warfare, were fighting a British Expedition at\r\nArchangel, Japanese invaders in Eastern Siberia, Roumanians with French\r\nand Greek contingents in the south, the Russian Admiral Koltchak in\r\nSiberia and General Deniken, supported by the French fleet, in the\r\nCrimea.  In July of that year an Esthonian army, under General\r\nYudenitch, almost got to Petersburg.  In 1920 the Poles, incited by the\r\nFrench, made a new attack on Russia; and a new reactionary raider,\r\nGeneral Wrangel, took over the task of General Deniken in invading and\r\ndevastating his own country.  In March, 1921, the sailors at Cronstadt\r\nrevolted.  The Russian Government under its president, Lenin, survived\r\nall these various attacks.  It showed an amazing tenacity, and the\r\ncommon people of Russia sustained it unswervingly under conditions of\r\nextreme hardship.  By the end of 1921 both Britain and Italy had made a\r\nsort of recognition of the communist rule.\r\n\r\nBut if the Bolshevik Government was successful in its struggle against\r\nforeign intervention and internal revolt, it was far less happy in its\r\nattempts to set up a new social order based upon communist ideas in\r\nRussia.  The Russian peasant is a small land-hungry proprietor, as far\r\nfrom communism in his thoughts and methods as a whale is from flying;\r\nthe revolution gave him the land of the great landowners but could not\r\nmake him grow food for anything but negotiable money, and the\r\nrevolution, among other things, had practically destroyed the value of\r\nmoney. Agricultural production, already greatly disordered by the\r\ncollapse of the railways through war-strain, shrank to a mere\r\ncultivation of food by the peasants for their own consumption.  The\r\ntowns starved.  Hasty and ill-planned attempts to make over industrial\r\nproduction in accordance with communist ideas were equally\r\nunsuccessful.  By 1920 Russia presented the unprecedented spectacle of\r\na modern civilization in complete collapse.  Railways were rusting and\r\npassing out of use, towns were falling into ruin, everywhere there was\r\nan immense mortality.  Yet the country still fought with its enemies at\r\nits gates.  In 1921 came a drought and a great famine among the peasant\r\ncultivators in the war-devastated south-east provinces.  Millions of\r\npeople starved.\r\n\r\nBut the question of the distresses and the possible recuperation of\r\nRussia brings us too close to current controversies to be discussed\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVII\r\nTHE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL RECONSTRUCTION OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scheme and scale upon which this History is planned do not permit\r\nus to enter into the complicated and acrimonious disputes that centre\r\nabout the treaties, and particularly of the treaty of Versailles, which\r\nconcluded the Great War. We are beginning to realize that that\r\nconflict, terrible and enormous as it was, ended nothing, began nothing\r\nand settled nothing. It killed millions of people; it wasted and\r\nimpoverished the world. It smashed Russia altogether. It was at best an\r\nacute and frightful reminder that we were living foolishly and\r\nconfusedly without much plan or foresight in a dangerous and\r\nunsympathetic universe. The crudely organized egotisms and passions of\r\nnational and imperial greed that carried mankind into that tragedy,\r\nemerged from it sufficiently unimpaired to make some other similar\r\ndisaster highly probable so soon as the world has a little recovered\r\nfrom its war exhaustion and fatigue. Wars and revolutions make nothing;\r\ntheir utmost service to mankind is that, in a very rough and painful\r\nway, they destroy superannuated and obstructive things. The great war\r\nlifted the threat of German imperialism from Europe, and shattered the\r\nimperialism of Russia. It cleared away a number of monarchies. But a\r\nmultitude of flags still waves in Europe, the frontiers still\r\nexasperate, great armies accumulate fresh stores of equipment.\r\n\r\nThe Peace Conference at Versailles was a gathering very ill adapted to\r\ndo more than carry out the conflicts and defeats of the war to their\r\nlogical conclusions.  The Germans, Austrians, Turks and Bulgarians were\r\npermitted no share in its deliberations; they were only to accept the\r\ndecisions it dictated to them.  From the point of view of human welfare\r\nthe choice of the place of meeting was particularly unfortunate.  It\r\nwas at Versailles in 1871 that, with every circumstance of triumphant\r\nvulgarity, the new German Empire had been proclaimed.  The suggestion\r\nof a melodramatic reversal of that scene, in the same Hall of Mirrors,\r\nwas overpowering.\r\n\r\nWhatever generosities had appeared in the opening phases of the Great\r\nWar had long been exhausted.  The populations of the victorious\r\ncountries were acutely aware of their own losses and sufferings, and\r\nentirely regardless of the fact that the defeated had paid in the like\r\nmanner.  The war had arisen as a natural and inevitable consequence of\r\nthe competitive nationalisms of Europe and the absence of any Federal\r\nadjustment of these competitive forces; war is the necessary logical\r\nconsummation of independent sovereign nationalities living in too small\r\nan area with too powerful an armament; and if the great war had not\r\ncome in the form it did it would have come in some similar form—just as\r\nit will certainly return upon a still more disastrous scale in twenty\r\nor thirty years’ time if no political unification anticipates and\r\nprevents it.  States organized for war will make wars as surely as hens\r\nwill lay eggs, but the feeling of these distressed and war-worn\r\ncountries disregarded this fact, and the whole of the defeated peoples\r\nwere treated as morally and materially responsible for all the damage,\r\nas they would no doubt have treated the victor peoples had the issue of\r\nwar been different.  The French and English thought the Germans were to\r\nblame, the Germans thought the Russians, French and English were to\r\nblame, and only an intelligent minority thought that there was anything\r\nto blame in the fragmentary political constitution of Europe.  The\r\ntreaty of Versailles was intended to be exemplary and vindictive; it\r\nprovided tremendous penalties for the vanquished; it sought to provide\r\ncompensations for the wounded and suffering victors by imposing\r\nenormous debts upon nations already bankrupt, and its attempts to\r\nreconstitute international relations by the establishment of a League\r\nof Nations against war were manifestly insincere and inadequate.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASSENGER AEROPLANE FLYING OVER NORTHOLT\r\nPASSENGER AEROPLANE FLYING OVER NORTHOLT\r\n\r\n_(Photo taken by another ’plane by the Central Aerophoto Co.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as Europe was concerned it is doubtful if there would have been\r\nany attempt whatever to organize international relations for a\r\npermanent peace.  The proposal of the League of Nations was brought\r\ninto practical politics by the President of the United States of\r\nAmerica, President Wilson.  Its chief support was in America.  So far\r\nthe United States, this new modern state, had developed no distinctive\r\nideas of international relationship beyond the Monroe Doctrine, which\r\nprotected the new world from European interference. Now suddenly it was\r\ncalled upon for its mental contribution to the vast problem of the\r\ntime.  It had none.  The natural disposition of the American people was\r\ntowards a permanent world peace.  With this however was linked a strong\r\ntraditional distrust of old-world polities and a habit of isolation\r\nfrom old-world entanglements. The Americans had hardly begun to think\r\nout an American solution of world problems when the submarine campaign\r\nof the Germans dragged them into the war on the side of the anti-German\r\nallies. President Wilson’s scheme of a League of Nations was an attempt\r\nat short notice to create a distinctively American world project.  It\r\nwas a sketchy, inadequate and dangerous scheme.  In Europe however it\r\nwas taken as a matured American point of view. The generality of\r\nmankind in 1918-19 was intensely weary of war and anxious at almost any\r\nsacrifice to erect barriers against its recurrence, but there was not a\r\nsingle government in the old world willing to waive one iota of its\r\nsovereign independence to attain any such end.  The public utterances\r\nof President Wilson leading up to the project of a World League of\r\nNations seemed for a time to appeal right over the heads of the\r\ngovernments to the peoples of the world; they were taken as expressing\r\nthe ripe intentions of America, and the response was enormous. \r\nUnhappily President Wilson had to deal with governments and not with\r\npeoples; he was a man capable of tremendous flashes of vision and yet\r\nwhen put to the test egotistical and limited, and the great wave of\r\nenthusiasm he evoked passed and was wasted.\r\n\r\nSays Dr. Dillon in his book, _The Peace Conference:_ “Europe, when the\r\nPresident touched its shores, was as clay ready for the creative\r\npotter.  Never before were the nations so eager to follow a Moses who\r\nwould take them to the long-promised land where wars are prohibited and\r\nblockades unknown.  And to their thinking he was just that great\r\nleader.  In France men bowed down before him with awe and affection. \r\nLabour leaders in Paris told me that they shed tears of joy in his\r\npresence, and that their comrades would go through fire and water to\r\nhelp him to realize his noble schemes.  To the working classes in Italy\r\nhis name was a heavenly clarion at the sound of which the earth would\r\nbe renewed. The Germans regarded him and his doctrine as their\r\nsheet-anchor of safety.  The fearless Herr Muehlon said: ‘If President\r\nWilson were to address the Germans and pronounce a severe sentence upon\r\nthem, they would accept it with resignation and without a murmur and\r\nset to work at once.’  In German-Austria his fame was that of a\r\nsaviour, and the mere mention of his name brought balm to the suffering\r\nand surcease of sorrow to the afflicted ... .”\r\n\r\nSuch were the overpowering expectations that President Wilson raised.\r\nHow completely he disappointed them and how weak and futile was the\r\nLeague of Nations he made is too long and too distressful a story to\r\ntell here. He exaggerated in his person our common human tragedy, he\r\nwas so very great in his dreams and so incapable in his performance.\r\nAmerica dissented from the acts of its President and would not join the\r\nLeague Europe accepted from him. There was a slow realization on the\r\npart of the American people that it had been rushed into something for\r\nwhich it was totally unprepared. There was a corresponding realization\r\non the part of Europe that America had nothing ready to give to the old\r\nworld in its extremity. Born prematurely and crippled at its birth,\r\nthat League has become indeed, with its elaborate and unpractical\r\nconstitution and its manifest limitations of power, a serious obstacle\r\nin the way of any effective reorganization of international\r\nrelationships. The problem would be a clearer one if the League did not\r\nyet exist. Yet that world-wide blaze of enthusiasm that first welcomed\r\nthe project, that readiness of men everywhere round and about the\r\nearth, of men, that is, as distinguished from governments, for a world\r\ncontrol of war, is a thing to be recorded with emphasis in any history.\r\nBehind the short-sighted governments that divide and mismanage human\r\naffairs, a real force for world unity and world order exists and grows.\r\n\r\nFrom 1918 onward the world entered upon an age of conferences.  Of\r\nthese the Conference at Washington called by President Harding (1921)\r\nhas been the most successful and suggestive.  Notable, too, is the\r\nGenoa Conference (1922) for the appearance of German and Russian\r\ndelegates at its deliberations.  We will not discuss this long\r\nprocession of conferences and tentatives in any detail.  It becomes\r\nmore and more clearly manifest that a huge work of reconstruction has\r\nto be done by mankind if a crescendo of such convulsions and world\r\nmassacres as that of the great war is to be averted.  No such hasty\r\nimprovisation as the League of Nations, no patched-up system of\r\nConferences between this group of states and that, which change nothing\r\nwith an air of settling everything, will meet the complex political\r\nneeds of the new age that lies before us.  A systematic development and\r\na systematic application of the sciences of human relationship, of\r\npersonal and group psychology, of financial and economic science and of\r\neducation, sciences still only in their infancy, is required.  Narrow\r\nand obsolete, dead and dying moral and political ideas have to be\r\nreplaced by a clearer and a simpler conception of the common origins\r\nand destinies of our kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PEACEFUL GARDEN IN ENGLAND\r\nA PEACEFUL GARDEN IN ENGLAND\r\nGiven wisdom, all mankind might live in such gardens\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if the dangers, confusions and disasters that crowd upon man in\r\nthese days are enormous beyond any experience of the past, it is\r\nbecause science has brought him such powers as he never had before. And\r\nthe scientific method of fearless thought, exhaustively lucid\r\nstatement, and exhaustively criticized planning, which has given him\r\nthese as yet uncontrollable powers, gives him also the hope of\r\ncontrolling these powers.  Man is still only adolescent.  His troubles\r\nare not the troubles of senility and exhaustion but of increasing and\r\nstill undisciplined strength.  When we look at all history as one\r\nprocess, as we have been doing in this book, when we see the steadfast\r\nupward struggle of life towards vision and control, then we see in\r\ntheir true proportions the hopes and dangers of the present time.  As\r\nyet we are hardly in the earliest dawn of human greatness.  But in the\r\nbeauty of flower and sunset, in the happy and perfect movement of young\r\nanimals and in the delight of ten thousand various landscapes, we have\r\nsome intimations of what life can do for us, and in some few works of\r\nplastic and pictorial art, in some great music, in a few noble\r\nbuildings and happy gardens, we have an intimation of what the human\r\nwill can do with material possibilities.  We have dreams; we have at\r\npresent undisciplined but ever increasing power.  Can we doubt that\r\npresently our race will more than realize our boldest imaginations,\r\nthat it will achieve unity and peace, that it will live, the children\r\nof our blood and lives will live, in a world made more splendid and\r\nlovely than any palace or garden that we know, going on from strength\r\nto strength in an ever widening circle of adventure and achievement?\r\nWhat man has done, the little triumphs of his present state, and all\r\nthis history we have told, form but the prelude to the things that man\r\nhas got to do.\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL TABLE\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1000 B.C. the Aryan peoples were establishing themselves\r\nin the peninsulas of Spain, Italy and the Balkans, and they were\r\nestablished in North India; Cnossos was already destroyed and the\r\nspacious times of Egypt, of Thothmes III, Amenophis III and Rameses II\r\nwere three or four centuries away. Weak monarchs of the XXIst Dynasty\r\nwere ruling in the Nile Valley. Israel was united under her early\r\nkings; Saul or David or possibly even Solomon may have been reigning.\r\nSargon I (2750 B.C.) of the Akkadian Sumerian Empire was a remote\r\nmemory in Babylonian history, more remote than is Constantine the Great\r\nfrom the world of the present day. Hammurabi had been dead a thousand\r\nyears. The Assyrians were already dominating the less military\r\nBabylonians. In 1100 B.C. Tiglath Pileser I had taken Babylon. But\r\nthere was no permanent conquest; Assyria and Babylonia were still\r\nseparate empires. In China the new Chow dynasty was flourishing.\r\nStonehenge in England was already some hundreds of years old.\r\n\r\nThe next two centuries saw a renascence of Egypt under the XXIInd\r\nDynasty, the splitting up of the brief little Hebrew kingdom of\r\nSolomon, the spreading of the Greeks in the Balkans, South Italy and\r\nAsia Minor, and the days of Etruscan predominance in Central Italy.
