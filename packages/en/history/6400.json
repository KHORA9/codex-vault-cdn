Suetonius Tranquillus;\r\n\r\nTo which are added,\r\n\r\nHIS LIVES OF THE GRAMMARIANS, RHETORICIANS, AND POETS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Translation of Alexander Thomson, M.D.\r\n\r\nRevised and corrected by T.Forester, Esq., A.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Suetonius Tranquillus was the son of a Roman knight who commanded a\r\nlegion, on the side of Otho, at the battle which decided the fate of the\r\nempire in favour of Vitellius.  From incidental notices in the following\r\nHistory, we learn that he was born towards the close of the reign of\r\nVespasian, who died in the year 79 of the Christian era.  He lived till\r\nthe time of Hadrian, under whose administration he filled the office of\r\nsecretary; until, with several others, he was dismissed for presuming on\r\nfamiliarities with the empress Sabina, of which we have no further\r\naccount than that they were unbecoming his position in the imperial\r\ncourt.  How long he survived this disgrace, which appears to have\r\nbefallen him in the year 121, we are not informed; but we find that the\r\nleisure afforded him by his retirement, was employed in the composition\r\nof numerous works, of which the only portions now extant are collected in\r\nthe present volume.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the younger Pliny’s letters are addressed to Suetonius, with\r\nwhom he lived in the closest friendship.  They afford some brief, but\r\ngenerally pleasant, glimpses of his habits and career; and in a letter,\r\nin which Pliny makes application on behalf of his friend to the emperor\r\nTrajan, for a mark of favour, he speaks of him as “a most excellent,\r\nhonourable, and learned man, whom he had the pleasure of entertaining\r\nunder his own roof, and with whom the nearer he was brought into\r\ncommunion, the more he loved him.” [1]\r\n\r\nThe plan adopted by Suetonius in his Lives of the Twelve Caesars, led him\r\nto be more diffuse on their personal conduct and habits than on public\r\nevents.  He writes Memoirs rather than History.  He neither dwells on the\r\ncivil wars which sealed the fall of the Republic, nor on the military\r\nexpeditions which extended the frontiers of the empire; nor does he\r\nattempt to develop the causes of the great political changes which marked\r\nthe period of which he treats.\r\n\r\nWhen we stop to gaze in a museum or gallery on the antique busts of the\r\nCaesars, we perhaps endeavour to trace in their sculptured physiognomy\r\nthe characteristics of those princes, who, for good or evil, were in\r\ntheir times masters of the destinies of a large portion of the human\r\nrace.  The pages of Suetonius will amply gratify this natural curiosity.\r\nIn them we find a series of individual portraits sketched to the life,\r\nwith perfect truth and rigorous impartiality.  La Harpe remarks of\r\nSuetonius, “He is scrupulously exact, and strictly methodical.  He omits\r\nnothing which concerns the person whose life he is writing; he relates\r\neverything, but paints nothing.  His work is, in some sense, a collection\r\nof anecdotes, but it is very curious to read and consult.” [2]\r\n\r\nCombining as it does amusement and information, Suetonius’s “Lives of the\r\nCaesars” was held in such estimation, that, so soon after the invention\r\nof printing as the year 1500, no fewer than eighteen editions had been\r\npublished, and nearly one hundred have since been added to the number.\r\nCritics of the highest rank have devoted themselves to the task of\r\ncorrecting and commenting on the text, and the work has been translated\r\ninto most European languages.  Of the English translations, that of Dr.\r\nAlexander Thomson, published in 1796, has been made the basis of the\r\npresent.  He informs us in his Preface, that a version of Suetonius was\r\nwith him only a secondary object, his principal design being to form a\r\njust estimate of Roman literature, and to elucidate the state of\r\ngovernment, and the manners of the times; for which the work of Suetonius\r\nseemed a fitting vehicle.  Dr. Thomson’s remarks appended to each\r\nsuccessive reign, are reprinted nearly verbatim in the present edition.\r\nHis translation, however, was very diffuse, and retained most of the\r\ninaccuracies of that of Clarke, on which it was founded; considerable\r\ncare therefore has been bestowed in correcting it, with the view of\r\nproducing, as far as possible, a literal and faithful version.\r\n\r\nTo render the works of Suetonius, as far as they are extant, complete,\r\nhis Lives of eminent Grammarians, Rhetoricians, and Poets, of which a\r\ntranslation has not before appeared in English, are added.  These Lives\r\nabound with anecdote and curious information connected with learning and\r\nliterary men during the period of which the author treats.\r\n                                                            T.

Julius Caesar, the Divine [3], lost his father [4] when he was in the\r\nsixteenth year of his age [5]; and the year following, being nominated to\r\nthe office of high-priest of Jupiter [6], he repudiated Cossutia, who was\r\nvery wealthy, although her family belonged only to the equestrian order,\r\nand to whom he had been contracted when he was a mere boy.  He then\r\nmarried (2) Cornelia, the daughter of Cinna, who was four times consul;\r\nand had by her, shortly afterwards, a daughter named Julia.  Resisting\r\nall the efforts of the dictator Sylla to induce him to divorce Cornelia,\r\nhe suffered the penalty of being stripped of his sacerdotal office, his\r\nwife’s dowry, and his own patrimonial estates; and, being identified with\r\nthe adverse faction [7], was compelled to withdraw from Rome.  After\r\nchanging his place of concealment nearly every night [8], although he was\r\nsuffering from a quartan ague, and having effected his release by bribing\r\nthe officers who had tracked his footsteps, he at length obtained a\r\npardon through the intercession of the vestal virgins, and of Mamercus\r\nAemilius and Aurelius Cotta, his near relatives.  We are assured that\r\nwhen Sylla, having withstood for a while the entreaties of his own best\r\nfriends, persons of distinguished rank, at last yielded to their\r\nimportunity, he exclaimed--either by a divine impulse, or from a shrewd\r\nconjecture: “Your suit is granted, and you may take him among you; but\r\nknow,” he added, “that this man, for whose safety you are so extremely\r\nanxious, will, some day or other, be the ruin of the party of the nobles,\r\nin defence of which you are leagued with me; for in this one Caesar, you\r\nwill find many a Marius.”\r\n\r\nII.  His first campaign was served in Asia, on the staff of the praetor,\r\nM. Thermus; and being dispatched into Bithynia [9], to bring thence a\r\nfleet, he loitered so long at the court of Nicomedes, as to give occasion\r\nto reports of a criminal intercourse between him and that prince; which\r\nreceived additional credit from his hasty return to Bithynia, under the\r\npretext of recovering a debt due to a freed-man, his client.  The rest of\r\nhis service was more favourable to his reputation; and (3) when Mitylene\r\n[10] was taken by storm, he was presented by Thermus with the civic\r\ncrown. [11]\r\n\r\nIII.  He served also in Cilicia [12], under Servilius Isauricus, but only\r\nfor a short time; as upon receiving intelligence of Sylla’s death, he\r\nreturned with all speed to Rome, in expectation of what might follow from\r\na fresh agitation set on foot by Marcus Lepidus.  Distrusting, however,\r\nthe abilities of this leader, and finding the times less favourable for\r\nthe execution of this project than he had at first imagined, he abandoned\r\nall thoughts of joining Lepidus, although he received the most tempting\r\noffers.\r\n\r\nIV.  Soon after this civil discord was composed, he preferred a charge of\r\nextortion against Cornelius Dolabella, a man of consular dignity, who had\r\nobtained the honour of a triumph.  On the acquittal of the accused, he\r\nresolved to retire to Rhodes [13], with the view not only of avoiding the\r\npublic odium (4) which he had incurred, but of prosecuting his studies\r\nwith leisure and tranquillity, under Apollonius, the son of Molon, at\r\nthat time the most celebrated master of rhetoric.  While on his voyage\r\nthither, in the winter season, he was taken by pirates near the island of\r\nPharmacusa [14], and detained by them, burning with indignation, for\r\nnearly forty days; his only attendants being a physician and two\r\nchamberlains.  For he had instantly dispatched his other servants and the\r\nfriends who accompanied him, to raise money for his ransom [15].  Fifty\r\ntalents having been paid down, he was landed on the coast, when, having\r\ncollected some ships [16], he lost no time in putting to sea in pursuit\r\nof the pirates, and having captured them, inflicted upon them the\r\npunishment with which he had often threatened them in jest.  At that time\r\nMithridates was ravaging the neighbouring districts, and on Caesar’s\r\narrival at Rhodes, that he might not appear to lie idle while danger\r\nthreatened the allies of Rome, he passed over into Asia, and having\r\ncollected some auxiliary forces, and driven the king’s governor out of\r\nthe province, retained in their allegiance the cities which were\r\nwavering, and ready to revolt.\r\n\r\nV.  Having been elected military tribune, the first honour he received\r\nfrom the suffrages of the people after his return to Rome, he zealously\r\nassisted those who took measures for restoring the tribunitian authority,\r\nwhich had been greatly diminished during the usurpation of Sylla.  He\r\nlikewise, by an act, which Plotius at his suggestion propounded to the\r\npeople, obtained the recall of Lucius Cinna, his wife’s brother, and\r\nothers with him, who having been the adherents of Lepidus in the civil\r\ndisturbances, had after that consul’s death fled to Sertorius [17]; which\r\nlaw he supported by a speech.\r\n\r\nVI.  During his quaestorship he pronounced funeral orations from the\r\nrostra, according to custom, in praise of his aunt (5) Julia, and his\r\nwife Cornelia.  In the panegyric on his aunt, he gives the following\r\naccount of her own and his father’s genealogy, on both sides: “My aunt\r\nJulia derived her descent, by the mother, from a race of kings, and by\r\nher father, from the Immortal Gods.  For the Marcii Reges [18], her\r\nmother’s family, deduce their pedigree from Ancus Marcius, and the Julii,\r\nher father’s, from Venus; of which stock we are a branch.  We therefore\r\nunite in our descent the sacred majesty of kings, the chiefest among men,\r\nand the divine majesty of Gods, to whom kings themselves are subject.”\r\n To supply the place of Cornelia, he married Pompeia, the daughter of\r\nQuintus Pompeius, and grand-daughter of Lucius Sylla; but he afterwards\r\ndivorced her, upon suspicion of her having been debauched by Publius\r\nClodius.  For so current was the report, that Clodius had found access to\r\nher disguised as a woman, during the celebration of a religious solemnity\r\n[19], that the senate instituted an enquiry respecting the profanation of\r\nthe sacred rites.\r\n\r\nVII.  Farther-Spain [20] fell to his lot as quaestor; when there, as he\r\nwas going the circuit of the province, by commission from the praetor,\r\nfor the administration of justice, and had reached Gades, seeing a statue\r\nof Alexander the Great in the temple of Hercules, he sighed deeply, as if\r\nweary of his sluggish life, for having performed no memorable actions at\r\nan age [21] at which Alexander had already conquered the world.  He,\r\ntherefore, immediately sued for his discharge, with the view of embracing\r\nthe first opportunity, which might present itself in The City, of\r\nentering upon a more exalted career.  In the stillness of the night\r\nfollowing, he dreamt that he lay with his own mother; but his confusion\r\nwas relieved, and his hopes were raised to the highest pitch, by the\r\ninterpreters of his dream, who expounded it as an omen that he should\r\npossess universal empire; for (6) that the mother who in his sleep he had\r\nfound submissive to his embraces, was no other than the earth, the common\r\nparent of all mankind.\r\n\r\nVIII.  Quitting therefore the province before the expiration of the usual\r\nterm, he betook himself to the Latin colonies, which were then eagerly\r\nagitating the design of obtaining the freedom of Rome; and he would have\r\nstirred them up to some bold attempt, had not the consuls, to prevent any\r\ncommotion, detained for some time the legions which had been raised for\r\nservice in Cilicia.  But this did not deter him from making, soon\r\nafterwards, a still greater effort within the precincts of the city\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIX.  For, only a few days before he entered upon the aedileship, he\r\nincurred a suspicion of having engaged in a conspiracy with Marcus\r\nCrassus, a man of consular rank; to whom were joined Publius Sylla and\r\nLucius Autronius, who, after they had been chosen consuls, were convicted\r\nof bribery.  The plan of the conspirators was to fall upon the senate at\r\nthe opening of the new year, and murder as many of them as should be\r\nthought necessary; upon which, Crassus was to assume the office of\r\ndictator, and appoint Caesar his master of the horse [22].  When the\r\ncommonwealth had been thus ordered according to their pleasure, the\r\nconsulship was to have been restored to Sylla and Autronius.  Mention is\r\nmade of this plot by Tanusius Geminus [23] in his history, by Marcus\r\nBibulus in his edicts [24], and by Curio, the father, in his orations\r\n[25]. Cicero likewise seems to hint at this in a letter to Axius, where\r\nhe says, that Caesar (7) had in his consulship secured to himself that\r\narbitrary power [26] to which he had aspired when he was edile.  Tanusius\r\nadds, that Crassus, from remorse or fear, did not appear upon the day\r\nappointed for the massacre of the senate; for which reason Caesar omitted\r\nto give the signal, which, according to the plan concerted between them,\r\nhe was to have made.  The agreement, Curio says, was that he should shake\r\noff the toga from his shoulder.  We have the authority of the same Curio,\r\nand of M. Actorius Naso, for his having been likewise concerned in\r\nanother conspiracy with young Cneius Piso; to whom, upon a suspicion of\r\nsome mischief being meditated in the city, the province of Spain was\r\ndecreed out of the regular course [27].  It is said to have been agreed\r\nbetween them, that Piso should head a revolt in the provinces, whilst the\r\nother should attempt to stir up an insurrection at Rome, using as their\r\ninstruments the Lambrani, and the tribes beyond the Po.  But the\r\nexecution of this design was frustrated in both quarters by the death of\r\nPiso.\r\n\r\nX.  In his aedileship, he not only embellished the Comitium, and the rest\r\nof the Forum [28], with the adjoining halls [29], but adorned the Capitol\r\nalso, with temporary piazzas, constructed for the purpose of displaying\r\nsome part of the superabundant collections (8) he had made for the\r\namusement of the people [30].  He entertained them with the hunting of\r\nwild beasts, and with games, both alone and in conjunction with his\r\ncolleague.  On this account, he obtained the whole credit of the expense\r\nto which they had jointly contributed; insomuch that his colleague,\r\nMarcus Bibulus, could not forbear remarking, that he was served in the\r\nmanner of Pollux.  For as the temple [31] erected in the Forum to the two\r\nbrothers, went by the name of Castor alone, so his and Caesar’s joint\r\nmunificence was imputed to the latter only.  To the other public\r\nspectacles exhibited to the people, Caesar added a fight of gladiators,\r\nbut with fewer pairs of combatants than he had intended.  For he had\r\ncollected from all parts so great a company of them, that his enemies\r\nbecame alarmed; and a decree was made, restricting the number of\r\ngladiators which any one was allowed to retain at Rome.\r\n\r\nXI.  Having thus conciliated popular favour, he endeavoured, through his\r\ninterest with some of the tribunes, to get Egypt assigned to him as a\r\nprovince, by an act of the people.  The pretext alleged for the creation\r\nof this extraordinary government, was, that the Alexandrians had\r\nviolently expelled their king [32], whom the senate had complimented with\r\nthe title of an ally and friend of the Roman people.  This was generally\r\nresented; but, notwithstanding, there was so much opposition from the\r\nfaction of the nobles, that he could not carry his point.  In order,\r\ntherefore, to diminish their influence by every means in his power, he\r\nrestored the trophies erected in honour of Caius Marius, on account of\r\nhis victories over Jugurtha, the Cimbri, and the Teutoni, which had been\r\ndemolished by Sylla; and when sitting in judgment upon murderers, he\r\ntreated those as assassins, who, in the late proscription, had received\r\nmoney from the treasury, for bringing in the heads of Roman citizens,\r\nalthough they were expressly excepted in the Cornelian laws.\r\n\r\nXII.  He likewise suborned some one to prefer an impeachment (9) for\r\ntreason against Caius Rabirius, by whose especial assistance the senate\r\nhad, a few years before, put down Lucius Saturninus, the seditious\r\ntribune; and being drawn by lot a judge on the trial, he condemned him\r\nwith so much animosity, that upon his appealing to the people, no\r\ncircumstance availed him so much as the extraordinary bitterness of his\r\njudge.\r\n\r\nXIII.  Having renounced all hope of obtaining Egypt for his province, he\r\nstood candidate for the office of chief pontiff, to secure which, he had\r\nrecourse to the most profuse bribery.  Calculating, on this occasion, the\r\nenormous amount of the debts he had contracted, he is reported to have\r\nsaid to his mother, when she kissed him at his going out in the morning\r\nto the assembly of the people, “I will never return home unless I am\r\nelected pontiff.”  In effect, he left so far behind him two most powerful\r\ncompetitors, who were much his superiors both in age and rank, that he\r\nhad more votes in their own tribes, than they both had in all the tribes\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nXIV.  After he was chosen praetor, the conspiracy of Catiline was\r\ndiscovered; and while every other member of the senate voted for\r\ninflicting capital punishment on the accomplices in that crime [33], he\r\nalone proposed that the delinquents should be distributed for safe\r\ncustody among the towns of Italy, their property being confiscated.  He\r\neven struck such terror into those who were advocates for greater\r\nseverity, by representing to them what universal odium would be attached\r\nto their memories by the Roman people, that Decius Silanus, consul elect,\r\ndid not hesitate to qualify his proposal, it not being very honourable to\r\nchange it, by a lenient interpretation; as if it had been understood in a\r\nharsher sense than he intended, and Caesar would certainly have carried\r\nhis point, having brought over to his side a great number of the\r\nsenators, among whom was Cicero, the consul’s brother, had not a speech\r\nby Marcus Cato infused new vigour into the resolutions of the senate.  He\r\npersisted, however, in obstructing the measure, until a body of the Roman\r\nknights, who stood under arms as a guard, threatened him with instant\r\ndeath, if he continued his determined opposition.  They even thrust at\r\nhim with their drawn swords, so that those who sat next him moved away;\r\n(10) and a few friends, with no small difficulty, protected him, by\r\nthrowing their arms round him, and covering him with their togas.  At\r\nlast, deterred by this violence, he not only gave way, but absented\r\nhimself from the senate-house during the remainder of that year.\r\n\r\nXV.  Upon the first day of his praetorship, he summoned Quintus Catulus\r\nto render an account to the people respecting the repairs of the Capitol\r\n[34]; proposing a decree for transferring the office of curator to\r\nanother person [35].  But being unable to withstand the strong opposition\r\nmade by the aristocratical party, whom he perceived quitting, in great\r\nnumbers, their attendance upon the new consuls [36], and fully resolved\r\nto resist his proposal, he dropped the design.\r\n\r\nXVI.  He afterwards approved himself a most resolute supporter of\r\nCaecilius Metullus, tribune of the people, who, in spite of all\r\nopposition from his colleagues, had proposed some laws of a violent\r\ntendency [37], until they were both dismissed from office by a vote of\r\nthe senate.  He ventured, notwithstanding, to retain his post and\r\ncontinue in the administration of justice; but finding that preparations\r\nwere made to obstruct him by force of arms, he dismissed the lictors,\r\nthrew off his gown, and betook himself privately to his own house, with\r\nthe resolution of being quiet, in a time so unfavourable to his\r\ninterests.  He likewise pacified the mob, which two days afterwards\r\nflocked about him, and in a riotous manner made a voluntary tender of\r\ntheir assistance in the vindication of his (11) honour.  This happening\r\ncontrary to expectation, the senate, who met in haste, on account of the\r\ntumult, gave him their thanks by some of the leading members of the\r\nhouse, and sending for him, after high commendation of his conduct,\r\ncancelled their former vote, and restored him to his office.\r\n\r\nXVII.  But he soon got into fresh trouble, being named amongst the\r\naccomplices of Catiline, both before Novius Niger the quaestor, by Lucius\r\nVettius the informer, and in the senate by Quintus Curius; to whom a\r\nreward had been voted, for having first discovered the designs of the\r\nconspirators.  Curius affirmed that he had received his information from\r\nCatiline.  Vettius even engaged to produce in evidence against him his\r\nown hand-writing, given to Catiline.  Caesar, feeling that this treatment\r\nwas not to be borne, appealed to Cicero himself, whether he had not\r\nvoluntarily made a discovery to him of some particulars of the\r\nconspiracy; and so baulked Curius of his expected reward.  He, therefore,\r\nobliged Vettius to give pledges for his behaviour, seized his goods, and\r\nafter heavily fining him, and seeing him almost torn in pieces before the\r\nrostra, threw him into prison; to which he likewise sent Novius the\r\nquaestor, for having presumed to take an information against a magistrate\r\nof superior authority.\r\n\r\nXVIII.  At the expiration of his praetorship he obtained by lot the\r\nFarther-Spain [38], and pacified his creditors, who were for detaining\r\nhim, by finding sureties for his debts [39].  Contrary, however, to both\r\nlaw and custom, he took his departure before the usual equipage and\r\noutfit were prepared.  It is uncertain whether this precipitancy arose\r\nfrom the apprehension of an impeachment, with which he was threatened on\r\nthe expiration of his former office, or from his anxiety to lose no time\r\nin relieving the allies, who implored him to come to their aid.  He had\r\nno (12) sooner established tranquillity in the province, than, without\r\nwaiting for the arrival of his successor, he returned to Rome, with equal\r\nhaste, to sue for a triumph [40], and the consulship.  The day of\r\nelection, however, being already fixed by proclamation, he could not\r\nlegally be admitted a candidate, unless he entered the city as a private\r\nperson [41].  On this emergency he solicited a suspension of the laws in\r\nhis favour; but such an indulgence being strongly opposed, he found\r\nhimself under the necessity of abandoning all thoughts of a triumph, lest\r\nhe should be disappointed of the consulship.\r\n\r\nXIX.  Of the two other competitors for the consulship, Lucius Luceius and\r\nMarcus Bibulus, he joined with the former, upon condition that Luceius,\r\nbeing a man of less interest but greater affluence, should promise money\r\nto the electors, in their joint names.  Upon which the party of the\r\nnobles, dreading how far he might carry matters in that high office, with\r\na colleague disposed to concur in and second his measures, advised\r\nBibulus to promise the voters as much as the other; and most of them\r\ncontributed towards the expense, Cato himself admitting that bribery;\r\nunder such circumstances, was for the public good [42].  He was\r\naccordingly elected consul jointly with Bibulus.  Actuated still by the\r\nsame motives, the prevailing party took care to assign provinces of small\r\nimportance to the new consuls, such as the care of the woods and roads.\r\nCaesar, incensed at this indignity, endeavoured by the most assiduous and\r\nflattering attentions to gain to his side Cneius Pompey, at that time\r\ndissatisfied with the senate for the backwardness they shewed to confirm\r\nhis acts, after his victories over Mithridates.  He likewise brought\r\nabout a reconciliation between Pompey and Marcus Crassus, who had been at\r\nvariance from (13) the time of their joint consulship, in which office\r\nthey were continually clashing; and he entered into an agreement with\r\nboth, that nothing should be transacted in the government, which was\r\ndispleasing to any of the three.\r\n\r\nXX.  Having entered upon his office [43], he introduced a new regulation,\r\nthat the daily acts both of the senate and people should be committed to\r\nwriting, and published [44].  He also revived an old custom, that an\r\nofficer [45] should precede him, and his lictors follow him, on the\r\nalternate months when the fasces were not carried before him.  Upon\r\npreferring a bill to the people for the division of some public lands, he\r\nwas opposed by his colleague, whom he violently drove out of the forum.\r\nNext day the insulted consul made a complaint in the senate of this\r\ntreatment; but such was the consternation, that no one having the courage\r\nto bring the matter forward or move a censure, which had been often done\r\nunder outrages of less importance, he was so much dispirited, that until\r\nthe expiration of his office he never stirred from home, and did nothing\r\nbut issue edicts to obstruct his colleague’s proceedings.  From that\r\ntime, therefore, Caesar had the sole management of public affairs;\r\ninsomuch that some wags, when they signed any instrument as witnesses,\r\ndid not add “in the consulship of Caesar and Bibulus,” but, “of Julius\r\nand Caesar;” putting the same person down twice, under his name and\r\nsurname.  The following verses likewise were currently repeated on this\r\noccasion:\r\n\r\n    Non Bibulo quidquam nuper, sed Caesare factum est;\r\n      Nam Bibulo fieri consule nil memini.\r\n\r\n          Nothing was done in Bibulus’s year:\r\n          No; Caesar only then was consul here.\r\n\r\n(14) The land of Stellas, consecrated by our ancestors to the gods, with\r\nsome other lands in Campania left subject to tribute, for the support of\r\nthe expenses of the government, he divided, but not by lot, among upwards\r\nof twenty thousand freemen, who had each of them three or more children.\r\nHe eased the publicans, upon their petition, of a third part of the sum\r\nwhich they had engaged to pay into the public treasury; and openly\r\nadmonished them not to bid so extravagantly upon the next occasion.  He\r\nmade various profuse grants to meet the wishes of others, no one opposing\r\nhim; or if any such attempt was made, it was soon suppressed.  Marcus\r\nCato, who interrupted him in his proceedings, he ordered to be dragged\r\nout of the senate-house by a lictor, and carried to prison.  Lucius\r\nLucullus, likewise, for opposing him with some warmth, he so terrified\r\nwith the apprehension of being criminated, that, to deprecate the\r\nconsul’s resentment, he fell on his knees.  And upon Cicero’s lamenting\r\nin some trial the miserable condition of the times, he the very same day,\r\nby nine o’clock, transferred his enemy, Publius Clodius, from a patrician\r\nto a plebeian family; a change which he had long solicited in vain [46].\r\nAt last, effectually to intimidate all those of the opposite party, he by\r\ngreat rewards prevailed upon Vettius to declare, that he had been\r\nsolicited by certain persons to assassinate Pompey; and when he was\r\nbrought before the rostra to name those who had been concerted between\r\nthem, after naming one or two to no purpose, not without great suspicion\r\nof subornation, Caesar, despairing of success in this rash stratagem, is\r\nsupposed to have taken off his informer by poison.\r\n\r\nXXI.  About the same time he married Calpurnia, the daughter of Lucius\r\nPiso, who was to succeed him in the consulship, and gave his own daughter\r\nJulia to Cneius Pompey; rejecting Servilius Caepio, to whom she had been\r\ncontracted, and by whose means chiefly he had but a little before baffled\r\nBibulus.  After this new alliance, he began, upon any debates in the\r\nsenate, to ask Pompey’s opinion first, whereas he used before to give\r\nthat distinction to Marcus Crassus; and it was (15) the usual practice\r\nfor the consul to observe throughout the year the method of consulting\r\nthe senate which he had adopted on the calends (the first) of January.\r\n\r\nXXII.  Being, therefore, now supported by the interest of his\r\nfather-in-law and son-in-law, of all the provinces he made choice of Gaul,\r\nas most likely to furnish him with matter and occasion for triumphs.  At\r\nfirst indeed he received only Cisalpine-Gaul, with the addition of\r\nIllyricum, by a decree proposed by Vatinius to the people; but soon\r\nafterwards obtained from the senate Gallia-Comata [47] also, the senators\r\nbeing apprehensive, that if they should refuse it him, that province,\r\nalso, would be granted him by the people.  Elated now with his success, he\r\ncould not refrain from boasting, a few days afterwards, in a full\r\nsenate-house, that he had, in spite of his enemies, and to their great\r\nmortification, obtained all he desired, and that for the future he would\r\nmake them, to their shame, submissive to his pleasure.  One of the\r\nsenators observing, sarcastically: “That will not be very easy for a woman\r\n[48] to do,” he jocosely replied, “Semiramis formerly reigned in Assyria,\r\nand the Amazons possessed great part of Asia.”\r\n\r\nXXIII.  When the term of his consulship had expired, upon a motion being\r\nmade in the senate by Caius Memmius and Lucius Domitius, the praetors,\r\nrespecting the transactions of the year past, he offered to refer himself\r\nto the house; but (16) they declining the business, after three days\r\nspent in vain altercation, he set out for his province.  Immediately,\r\nhowever, his quaestor was charged with several misdemeanors, for the\r\npurpose of implicating Caesar himself.  Indeed, an accusation was soon\r\nafter preferred against him by Lucius Antistius, tribune of the people;\r\nbut by making an appeal to the tribune’s colleagues, he succeeded in\r\nhaving the prosecution suspended during his absence in the service of the\r\nstate.  To secure himself, therefore, for the time to come, he was\r\nparticularly careful to secure the good-will of the magistrates at the\r\nannual elections, assisting none of the candidates with his interest, nor\r\nsuffering any persons to be advanced to any office, who would not\r\npositively undertake to defend him in his absence for which purpose he\r\nmade no scruple to require of some of them an oath, and even a written\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\nXXIV.  But when Lucius Domitius became a candidate for the consulship,\r\nand openly threatened that, upon his being elected consul, he would\r\neffect that which he could not accomplish when he was praetor, and divest\r\nhim of the command of the armies, he sent for Crassus and Pompey to\r\nLucca, a city in his province, and pressed them, for the purpose of\r\ndisappointing Domitius, to sue again for the consulship, and to continue\r\nhim in his command for five years longer; with both which requisitions\r\nthey complied.  Presumptuous now from his success, he added, at his own\r\nprivate charge, more legions to those which he had received from the\r\nrepublic; among the former of which was one levied in Transalpine Gaul,\r\nand called by a Gallic name, Alauda [49], which he trained and armed in\r\nthe Roman fashion, and afterwards conferred on it the freedom of the\r\ncity.  From this period he declined no occasion of war, however unjust\r\nand dangerous; attacking, without any provocation, as well the allies of\r\nRome as the barbarous nations which were its enemies: insomuch, that the\r\nsenate passed a decree for sending commissioners to examine into the\r\ncondition of Gaul; and some members even proposed that he should be\r\ndelivered up to the enemy.  But so great had been the success of his\r\nenterprises, that he had the honour of obtaining more days [50] (17) of\r\nsupplication, and those more frequently, than had ever before been\r\ndecreed to any commander.\r\n\r\nXXV.  During nine years in which he held the government of the province,\r\nhis achievements were as follows: he reduced all Gaul, bounded by the\r\nPyrenean forest, the Alps, mount Gebenna, and the two rivers, the Rhine\r\nand the Rhone, and being about three thousand two hundred miles in\r\ncompass, into the form of a province, excepting only the nations in\r\nalliance with the republic, and such as had merited his favour; imposing\r\nupon this new acquisition an annual tribute of forty millions of\r\nsesterces.  He was the first of the Romans who, crossing the Rhine by a\r\nbridge, attacked the Germanic tribes inhabiting the country beyond that\r\nriver, whom he defeated in several engagements.  He also invaded the\r\nBritons, a people formerly unknown, and having vanquished them, exacted\r\nfrom them contributions and hostages.  Amidst such a series of successes,\r\nhe experienced thrice only any signal disaster; once in Britain, when his\r\nfleet was nearly wrecked in a storm; in Gaul, at Gergovia, where one of\r\nhis legions was put to the rout; and in the territory of the Germans, his\r\nlieutenants Titurius and Aurunculeius were cut off by an ambuscade.\r\n\r\nXXVI.  During this period [51] he lost his mother [52], whose death was\r\nfollowed by that of his daughter [53], and, not long afterwards, of his\r\ngranddaughter.  Meanwhile, the republic being in consternation at the\r\nmurder of Publius Clodius, and the senate passing a vote that only one\r\nconsul, namely, Cneius Pompeius, should be chosen for the ensuing year,\r\nhe prevailed with the tribunes of the people, who intended joining him in\r\nnomination with Pompey, to propose to the people a bill, enabling him,\r\nthough absent, to become a candidate for his second consulship, when the\r\nterm of his command should be near expiring, that he might not be obliged\r\non that account to quit his province too soon, and before the conclusion\r\nof the war.  Having attained this object, carrying his views still\r\nhigher, and animated with the hopes of success, he omitted no (18)\r\nopportunity of gaining universal favour, by acts of liberality and\r\nkindness to individuals, both in public and private.  With money raised\r\nfrom the spoils of the war, he began to construct a new forum, the\r\nground-plot of which cost him above a hundred millions of sesterces [54].\r\nHe promised the people a public entertainment of gladiators, and a feast\r\nin memory of his daughter, such as no one before him had ever given.  The\r\nmore to raise their expectations on this occasion, although he had agreed\r\nwith victuallers of all denominations for his feast, he made yet farther\r\npreparations in private houses.  He issued an order, that the most\r\ncelebrated gladiators, if at any time during the combat they incurred the\r\ndispleasure of the public, should be immediately carried off by force,\r\nand reserved for some future occasion.  Young gladiators he trained up,\r\nnot in the school, and by the masters, of defence, but in the houses of\r\nRoman knights, and even senators, skilled in the use of arms, earnestly\r\nrequesting them, as appears from his letters, to undertake the discipline\r\nof those novitiates, and to give them the word during their exercises.\r\nHe doubled the pay of the legions in perpetuity; allowing them likewise\r\ncorn, when it was in plenty, without any restriction; and sometimes\r\ndistributing to every soldier in his army a slave, and a portion of land.\r\n\r\nXXVII.  To maintain his alliance and good understanding with Pompey, he\r\noffered him in marriage his sister’s grand-daughter Octavia, who had been\r\nmarried to Caius Marcellus; and requested for himself his daughter,\r\nlately contracted to Faustus Sylla.  Every person about him, and a great\r\npart likewise of the senate, he secured by loans of money at low\r\ninterest, or none at all; and to all others who came to wait upon him,\r\neither by invitation or of their own accord, he made liberal presents;\r\nnot neglecting even the freed-men and slaves, who were favourites with\r\ntheir masters and patrons.  He offered also singular and ready aid to all\r\nwho were under prosecution, or in debt, and to prodigal youths; excluding\r\nfrom (19) his bounty those only who were so deeply plunged in guilt,\r\npoverty, or luxury, that it was impossible effectually to relieve them.\r\nThese, he openly declared, could derive no benefit from any other means\r\nthan a civil war.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.  He endeavoured with equal assiduity to engage in his interest\r\nprinces and provinces in every part of the world; presenting some with\r\nthousands of captives, and sending to others the assistance of troops, at\r\nwhatever time and place they desired, without any authority from either\r\nthe senate or people of Rome.  He likewise embellished with magnificent\r\npublic buildings the most powerful cities not only of Italy, Gaul, and\r\nSpain, but of Greece and Asia; until all people being now astonished, and\r\nspeculating on the obvious tendency of these proceedings, Claudius\r\nMarcellus, the consul, declaring first by proclamation, that he intended\r\nto propose a measure of the utmost importance to the state, made a motion\r\nin the senate that some person should be appointed to succeed Caesar in\r\nhis province, before the term of his command was expired; because the war\r\nbeing brought to a conclusion, peace was restored, and the victorious\r\narmy ought to be disbanded.  He further moved, that Caesar being absent,\r\nhis claims to be a candidate at the next election of consuls should not\r\nbe admitted, as Pompey himself had afterwards abrogated that privilege by\r\na decree of the people.  The fact was, that Pompey, in his law relating\r\nto the choice of chief magistrates, had forgot to except Caesar, in the\r\narticle in which he declared all such as were not present incapable of\r\nbeing candidates for any office; but soon afterwards, when the law was\r\ninscribed on brass, and deposited in the treasury, he corrected his\r\nmistake.  Marcellus, not content with depriving Caesar of his provinces,\r\nand the privilege intended him by Pompey, likewise moved the senate, that\r\nthe freedom of the city should be taken from those colonists whom, by the\r\nVatinian law, he had settled at New Como [55]; because it had been\r\nconferred upon them with ambitious views, and by a stretch of the laws.\r\n\r\n(20) XXIX.  Roused by these proceedings, and thinking, as he was often\r\nheard to say, that it would be a more difficult enterprise to reduce him,\r\nnow that he was the chief man in the state, from the first rank of\r\ncitizens to the second, than from the second to the lowest of all, Caesar\r\nmade a vigorous opposition to the measure, partly by means of the\r\ntribunes, who interposed in his behalf, and partly through Servius\r\nSulpicius, the other consul.  The following year likewise, when Caius\r\nMarcellus, who succeeded his cousin Marcus in the consulship, pursued the\r\nsame course, Caesar, by means of an immense bribe, engaged in his defence\r\nAemilius Paulus, the other consul, and Caius Curio, the most violent of\r\nthe tribunes.  But finding the opposition obstinately bent against him,\r\nand that the consuls-elect were also of that party, he wrote a letter to\r\nthe senate, requesting that they would not deprive him of the privilege\r\nkindly granted him by the people; or else that the other generals should\r\nresign the command of their armies as well as himself; fully persuaded,\r\nas it is thought, that he could more easily collect his veteran soldiers,\r\nwhenever he pleased, than Pompey could his new-raised troops.  At the\r\nsame time, he made his adversaries an offer to disband eight of his\r\nlegions and give up Transalpine-Gaul, upon condition that he might retain\r\ntwo legions, with the Cisalpine province, or but one legion with\r\nIllyricum, until he should be elected consul.\r\n\r\nXXX.  But as the senate declined to interpose in the business, and his\r\nenemies declared that they would enter into no compromise where the\r\nsafety of the republic was at stake, he advanced into Hither-Gaul [56],\r\nand, having gone the circuit for the administration of justice, made a\r\nhalt at Ravenna, resolved to have recourse to arms if the senate should\r\nproceed to extremity against the tribunes of the people who had espoused\r\nhis cause.  This was indeed his pretext for the civil war; but it is\r\nsupposed that there were other motives for his conduct.  Cneius Pompey\r\nused frequently to say, that he sought to throw every thing into\r\nconfusion, because he was unable, with all his private wealth, to\r\ncomplete the works he had begun, and answer, at his return, the vast\r\nexpectations which he had excited in the people.  Others pretend that he\r\nwas apprehensive of being (21) called to account for what he had done in\r\nhis first consulship, contrary to the auspices, laws, and the protests of\r\nthe tribunes; Marcus Cato having sometimes declared, and that, too, with\r\nan oath, that he would prefer an impeachment against him, as soon as he\r\ndisbanded his army.  A report likewise prevailed, that if he returned as\r\na private person, he would, like Milo, have to plead his cause before the\r\njudges, surrounded by armed men.  This conjecture is rendered highly\r\nprobable by Asinius Pollio, who informs us that Caesar, upon viewing the\r\nvanquished and slaughtered enemy in the field of Pharsalia, expressed\r\nhimself in these very words: “This was their intention: I, Caius Caesar,\r\nafter all the great achievements I had performed, must have been\r\ncondemned, had I not summoned the army to my aid!”  Some think, that\r\nhaving contracted from long habit an extraordinary love of power, and\r\nhaving weighed his own and his enemies’ strength, he embraced that\r\noccasion of usurping the supreme power; which indeed he had coveted from\r\nthe time of his youth.  This seems to have been the opinion entertained\r\nby Cicero, who tells us, in the third book of his Offices, that Caesar\r\nused to have frequently in his mouth two verses of Euripides, which he\r\nthus translates:\r\n\r\n    Nam si violandum est jus, regnandi gratia\r\n    Violandum est: aliis rebus pietatem colas.\r\n\r\n    Be just, unless a kingdom tempts to break the laws,\r\n    For sovereign power alone can justify the cause. [57]\r\n\r\nXXXI.  When intelligence, therefore, was received, that the interposition\r\nof the tribunes in his favour had been utterly rejected, and that they\r\nthemselves had fled from the city, he immediately sent forward some\r\ncohorts, but privately, to prevent any suspicion of his design; and, to\r\nkeep up appearances, attended at a public spectacle, examined the model\r\nof a fencing-school which he proposed to build, and, as usual, sat down\r\nto table with a numerous party of his friends.  But after sun-set, mules\r\nbeing put to his carriage from a neighbouring mill, he set forward on his\r\njourney with all possible privacy, and a small retinue.  The lights going\r\nout, he lost his way, and (22) wandered about a long time, until at\r\nlength, by the help of a guide, whom he found towards day-break, he\r\nproceeded on foot through some narrow paths, and again reached the road.\r\nComing up with his troops on the banks of the Rubicon, which was the\r\nboundary of his province [58], he halted for a while, and, revolving in\r\nhis mind the importance of the step he was on the point of taking, he\r\nturned to those about him, and said: “We may still retreat; but if we\r\npass this little bridge, nothing is left for us but to fight it out in\r\narms.”\r\n\r\nXXXII.  While he was thus hesitating, the following incident occurred.  A\r\nperson remarkable for his noble mien and graceful aspect, appeared close\r\nat hand, sitting and playing upon a pipe.  When, not only the shepherds,\r\nbut a number of soldiers also flocked from their posts to listen to him,\r\nand some trumpeters among them, he snatched a trumpet from one of them,\r\nran to the river with it, and sounding the advance with a piercing blast,\r\ncrossed to the other side.  Upon this, Caesar exclaimed, “Let us go\r\nwhither the omens of the Gods and the iniquity of our enemies call us.\r\nThe die is now cast.”\r\n\r\nXXXIII.  Accordingly, having marched his army over the river, he shewed\r\nthem the tribunes of the people, who, upon their being driven from the\r\ncity, had come to meet him; and, in the presence of that assembly, called\r\nupon the troops to pledge him their fidelity, with tears in his eyes, and\r\nhis garment rent from his bosom.  It has been supposed, that upon this\r\noccasion he promised to every soldier a knight’s estate; but that opinion\r\nis founded on a mistake.  For when, in his harangue to them, he\r\nfrequently held out a finger of his left hand, and declared, that to\r\nrecompense those who should support him in the defence of his honour, he\r\nwould willingly part even with his ring; the soldiers at a distance, who\r\ncould more easily see than hear him while he spoke, formed their\r\nconception of what he said, by the eye, not by the ear; and accordingly\r\ngave out, that he had promised to each of them the privilege (23) of\r\nwearing the gold ring, and an estate of four hundred thousand sesterces.\r\n[60]\r\n\r\nXXXIV.  Of his subsequent proceedings I shall give a cursory detail, in\r\nthe order in which they occurred [61].  He took possession of Picenum,\r\nUmbria, and Etruria; and having obliged Lucius Domitius, who had been\r\ntumultuously nominated his successor, and held Corsinium with a garrison,\r\nto surrender, and dismissed him, he marched along the coast of the Upper\r\nSea, to Brundusium, to which place the consuls and Pompey were fled with\r\nthe intention of crossing the sea as soon as possible.  After vain\r\nattempts, by all the obstacles he could oppose, to prevent their leaving\r\nthe harbour, he turned his steps towards Rome, where he appealed to the\r\nsenate on the present state of public affairs; and then set out for\r\nSpain, in which province Pompey had a numerous army, under the command of\r\nthree lieutenants, Marcus Petreius, Lucius Afranius, and Marcus Varro;\r\ndeclaring amongst his friends, before he set forward, “That he was going\r\nagainst an army without a general, and should return thence against a\r\ngeneral without an army.”  Though his progress was retarded both by the\r\nsiege of Marseilles, which shut her gates against him, and a very great\r\nscarcity of corn, yet in a short time he bore down all before him.\r\n\r\nXXXV.  Thence he returned to Rome, and crossing the sea to Macedonia,\r\nblocked up Pompey during almost four months, within a line of ramparts of\r\nprodigious extent; and at last defeated him in the battle of Pharsalia.\r\nPursuing him in his flight to Alexandria, where he was informed of his\r\nmurder, he presently found himself also engaged, under all the\r\ndisadvantages of time and place, in a very dangerous war, with king\r\nPtolemy, who, he saw, had treacherous designs upon his life.  It was\r\nwinter, and he, within the walls of a well-provided and subtle enemy, was\r\ndestitute of every thing, and wholly unprepared (24) for such a conflict.\r\nHe succeeded, however, in his enterprise, and put the kingdom of Egypt\r\ninto the hands of Cleopatra and her younger brother; being afraid to make\r\nit a province, lest, under an aspiring prefect, it might become the\r\ncentre of revolt.  From Alexandria he went into Syria, and thence to\r\nPontus, induced by intelligence which he had received respecting\r\nPharnaces.  This prince, who was son of the great Mithridates, had seized\r\nthe opportunity which the distraction of the times offered for making war\r\nupon his neighbours, and his insolence and fierceness had grown with his\r\nsuccess.  Caesar, however, within five days after entering his country,\r\nand four hours after coming in sight of him, overthrew him in one\r\ndecisive battle.  Upon which, he frequently remarked to those about him\r\nthe good fortune of Pompey, who had obtained his military reputation,\r\nchiefly, by victory over so feeble an enemy.  He afterwards defeated\r\nScipio and Juba, who were rallying the remains of the party in Africa,\r\nand Pompey’s sons in Spain.\r\n\r\nXXXVI.  During the whole course of the civil war, he never once suffered\r\nany defeat, except in the case of his lieutenants; of whom Caius Curio\r\nfell in Africa, Caius Antonius was made prisoner in Illyricum, Publius\r\nDolabella lost a fleet in the same Illyricum, and Cneius Domitius\r\nCulvinus, an army in Pontus.  In every encounter with the enemy where he\r\nhimself commanded, he came off with complete success; nor was the issue\r\never doubtful, except on two occasions: once at Dyrrachium, when, being\r\nobliged to give ground, and Pompey not pursuing his advantage, he said\r\nthat “Pompey knew not how to conquer;” the other instance occurred in his\r\nlast battle in Spain, when, despairing of the event, he even had thoughts\r\nof killing himself.\r\n\r\nXXXVII.  For the victories obtained in the several wars, he triumphed\r\nfive different times; after the defeat of Scipio: four times in one\r\nmonth, each triumph succeeding the former by an interval of a few days;\r\nand once again after the conquest of Pompey’s sons.  His first and most\r\nglorious triumph was for the victories he gained in Gaul; the next for\r\nthat of Alexandria, the third for the reduction of Pontus, the fourth for\r\nhis African victory, and the last for that in Spain; and (25) they all\r\ndiffered from each other in their varied pomp and pageantry.  On the day\r\nof the Gallic triumph, as he was proceeding along the street called\r\nVelabrum, after narrowly escaping a fall from his chariot by the breaking\r\nof the axle-tree, he ascended the Capitol by torch-light, forty elephants\r\n[62] carrying torches on his right and left.  Amongst the pageantry of\r\nthe Pontic triumph, a tablet with this inscription was carried before\r\nhim: I CAME, I SAW, I CONQUERED [63]; not signifying, as other mottos on\r\nthe like occasion, what was done, so much as the dispatch with which it\r\nwas done.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.  To every foot-soldier in his veteran legions, besides the two\r\nthousand sesterces paid him in the beginning of the civil war, he gave\r\ntwenty thousand more, in the shape of prize-money.  He likewise allotted\r\nthem lands, but not in contiguity, that the former owners might not be\r\nentirely dispossessed.  To the people of Rome, besides ten modii of corn,\r\nand as many pounds of oil, he gave three hundred sesterces a man, which\r\nhe had formerly promised them, and a hundred more to each for the delay\r\nin fulfilling his engagement.  He likewise remitted a year’s rent due to\r\nthe treasury, for such houses in Rome as did not pay above two thousand\r\nsesterces a year; and through the rest of Italy, for all such as did not\r\nexceed in yearly rent five hundred sesterces.  To all this he added a\r\npublic entertainment, and a distribution of meat, and, after his Spanish\r\nvictory [64], two public dinners.  For, considering the first he had\r\ngiven as too sparing, and unsuited to his profuse liberality, he, five\r\ndays afterwards, added another, which was most plentiful.\r\n\r\nXXXIX.  The spectacles he exhibited to the people were of various kinds;\r\nnamely, a combat of gladiators [65], and stage-plays in the several wards\r\nof the city, and in different languages; likewise Circensian games [66],\r\nwrestlers, and the representation of a sea-fight.  In the conflict of\r\ngladiators presented in the Forum, Furius Leptinus, a man of praetorian\r\nfamily, entered the lists as a combatant, as did also Quintus Calpenus,\r\nformerly a senator, and a pleader of causes.  The Pyrrhic dance was\r\nperformed by some youths, who were sons to persons of the first\r\ndistinction in Asia and Bithynia.  In the plays, Decimus Laberius, who\r\nhad been a Roman knight, acted in his own piece; and being presented on\r\nthe spot with five hundred thousand sesterces, and a gold ring, he went\r\nfrom the stage, through the orchestra, and resumed his place in the seats\r\n(27) allotted for the equestrian order.  In the Circensisn games; the\r\ncircus being enlarged at each end, and a canal sunk round it, several of\r\nthe young nobility drove chariots, drawn, some by four, and others by two\r\nhorses, and likewise rode races on single horses.  The Trojan game was\r\nacted by two distinct companies of boys, one differing from the other in\r\nage and rank.  The hunting of wild beasts was presented for five days\r\nsuccessively; and on the last day a battle was fought by five hundred\r\nfoot, twenty elephants, and thirty horse on each side.  To afford room\r\nfor this engagement, the goals were removed, and in their space two camps\r\nwere pitched, directly opposite to each other.  Wrestlers likewise\r\nperformed for three days successively, in a stadium provided for the\r\npurpose in the Campus Martius.  A lake having been dug in the little\r\nCodeta [67], ships of the Tyrian and Egyptian fleets, containing two,\r\nthree, and four banks of oars, with a number of men on board, afforded an\r\nanimated representation of a sea-fight.  To these various diversions\r\nthere flocked such crowds of spectators from all parts, that most of the\r\nstrangers were obliged to lodge in tents erected in the streets, or along\r\nthe roads near the city.  Several in the throng were squeezed to death,\r\namongst whom were two senators.\r\n\r\nXL.  Turning afterwards his attention to the regulation of the\r\ncommonwealth, he corrected the calendar [68], which had for (28) some\r\ntime become extremely confused, through the unwarrantable liberty which\r\nthe pontiffs had taken in the article of intercalation.  To such a height\r\nhad this abuse proceeded, that neither the festivals designed for the\r\nharvest fell in summer, nor those for the vintage in autumn.  He\r\naccommodated the year to the course of the sun, ordaining that in future\r\nit should consist of three hundred and sixty-five days without any\r\nintercalary month; and that every fourth year an intercalary day should\r\nbe inserted.  That the year might thenceforth commence regularly with the\r\ncalends, or first of January, he inserted two months between November and\r\nDecember; so that the year in which this regulation was made consisted of\r\nfifteen months, including the month of intercalation, which, according to\r\nthe division of time then in use, happened that year.\r\n\r\nXLI.  He filled up the vacancies in the senate, by advancing several\r\nplebeians to the rank of patricians, and also increased the number of\r\npraetors, aediles, quaestors, and inferior magistrates; restoring, at the\r\nsame time, such as had been degraded by the censors, or convicted of\r\nbribery at elections.  The choice of magistrates he so divided with the\r\npeople, that, excepting only the candidates for the consulship, they\r\nnominated one half of them, and he the other.  The method which he\r\npractised in those cases was, to recommend such persons as he had pitched\r\nupon, by bills dispersed through the several tribes to this effect:\r\n“Caesar the dictator to such a tribe (naming it).  I recommend to you\r\n(naming likewise the persons), that by the favour of your votes they may\r\nattain to the honours for which they sue.”  He likewise admitted to\r\noffices the sons of those who had been proscribed.  The trial of causes\r\nhe restricted to two orders of judges, the equestrian and senatorial;\r\nexcluding the tribunes of the treasury who had before made a third class.\r\nThe revised census of the people he ordered to be taken neither in the\r\nusual manner or place, but street by street, by the principal inhabitants\r\nof the several quarters of the city; and he reduced the number of those\r\nwho received corn at the public cost, from three hundred and twenty, to a\r\nhundred and fifty, thousand.  To prevent any tumults on account of the\r\ncensus, he ordered that the praetor should every year fill up by lot the\r\nvacancies occasioned by death, from those who were not enrolled for the\r\nreceipt of corn.\r\n\r\n(29) XLII.  Eighty thousand citizens having been distributed into foreign\r\ncolonies [69], he enacted, in order to stop the drain on the population,\r\nthat no freeman of the city above twenty, and under forty, years of age,\r\nwho was not in the military service, should absent himself from Italy for\r\nmore than three years at a time; that no senator’s son should go abroad,\r\nunless in the retinue of some high officer; and as to those whose pursuit\r\nwas tending flocks and herds, that no less than a third of the number of\r\ntheir shepherds free-born should be youths.  He likewise made all those\r\nwho practised physic in Rome, and all teachers of the liberal arts, free\r\nof the city, in order to fix them in it, and induce others to settle\r\nthere.  With respect to debts, he disappointed the expectation which was\r\ngenerally entertained, that they would be totally cancelled; and ordered\r\nthat the debtors should satisfy their creditors, according to the\r\nvaluation of their estates, at the rate at which they were purchased\r\nbefore the commencement of the civil war; deducting from the debt what\r\nhad been paid for interest either in money or by bonds; by virtue of\r\nwhich provision about a fourth part of the debt was lost.  He dissolved\r\nall the guilds, except such as were of ancient foundation.  Crimes were\r\npunished with greater severity; and the rich being more easily induced to\r\ncommit them because they were only liable to banishment, without the\r\nforfeiture of their property, he stripped murderers, as Cicero observes,\r\nof their whole estates, and other offenders of one half.\r\n\r\nXLIII.  He was extremely assiduous and strict in the administration of\r\njustice.  He expelled from the senate such members as were convicted of\r\nbribery; and he dissolved the marriage of a man of pretorian rank, who\r\nhad married a lady two days after her divorce from a former husband,\r\nalthough there was no suspicion that they had been guilty of any illicit\r\nconnection.  He imposed duties on the importation of foreign goods.  The\r\nuse of litters for travelling, purple robes, and jewels, he permitted\r\nonly to persons of a certain age and station, and on particular days.  He\r\nenforced a rigid execution of the sumptuary laws; placing officers about\r\nthe markets, to seize upon all meats exposed to sale contrary to the\r\nrules, and bring them to him; sometimes sending his lictors and soldiers\r\nto (30) carry away such victuals as had escaped the notice of the\r\nofficers, even when they were upon the table.\r\n\r\nXLIV.  His thoughts were now fully employed from day to day on a variety\r\nof great projects for the embellishment and improvement of the city, as\r\nwell as for guarding and extending the bounds of the empire.  In the\r\nfirst place, he meditated the construction of a temple to Mars, which\r\nshould exceed in grandeur every thing of that kind in the world.  For\r\nthis purpose, he intended to fill up the lake on which he had entertained\r\nthe people with the spectacle of a sea-fight.  He also projected a most\r\nspacious theatre adjacent to the Tarpeian mount; and also proposed to\r\nreduce the civil law to a reasonable compass, and out of that immense and\r\nundigested mass of statutes to extract the best and most necessary parts\r\ninto a few books; to make as large a collection as possible of works in\r\nthe Greek and Latin languages, for the public use; the province of\r\nproviding and putting them in proper order being assigned to Marcus\r\nVarro.  He intended likewise to drain the Pomptine marshes, to cut a\r\nchannel for the discharge of the waters of the lake Fucinus, to form a\r\nroad from the Upper Sea through the ridge of the Appenine to the Tiber;\r\nto make a cut through the isthmus of Corinth, to reduce the Dacians, who\r\nhad over-run Pontus and Thrace, within their proper limits, and then to\r\nmake war upon the Parthians, through the Lesser Armenia, but not to risk\r\na general engagement with them, until he had made some trial of their\r\nprowess in war.  But in the midst of all his undertakings and projects,\r\nhe was carried off by death; before I speak of which, it may not be\r\nimproper to give an account of his person, dress, and manners; together\r\nwith what relates to his pursuits, both civil and military.\r\n\r\nXLV.  It is said that he was tall, of a fair complexion, round limbed,\r\nrather full faced, with eyes black and piercing; and that he enjoyed\r\nexcellent health, except towards the close of his life, when he was\r\nsubject to sudden fainting-fits, and disturbance in his sleep.  He was\r\nlikewise twice seized with the falling sickness while engaged in active\r\nservice.  He was so nice in the care of his person, that he not only kept\r\nthe hair of his head closely cut and had his face smoothly shaved, but\r\n(31) even caused the hair on other parts of the body to be plucked out by\r\nthe roots, a practice for which some persons rallied him.  His baldness\r\ngave him much uneasiness, having often found himself upon that account\r\nexposed to the jibes of his enemies.  He therefore used to bring forward\r\nthe hair from the crown of his head; and of all the honours conferred\r\nupon him by the senate and people, there was none which he either\r\naccepted or used with greater pleasure, than the right of wearing\r\nconstantly a laurel crown.  It is said that he was particular in his\r\ndress.  For he used the Latus Clavus [70] with fringes about the wrists,\r\nand always had it girded about him, but rather loosely.  This\r\ncircumstance gave origin to the expression of Sylla, who often advised\r\nthe nobles to beware of “the ill-girt boy.”\r\n\r\nXLVI.  He first inhabited a small house in the Suburra [71], but after\r\nhis advancement to the pontificate, he occupied a palace belonging to the\r\nstate in the Via Sacra.  Many writers say that he liked his residence to\r\nbe elegant, and his entertainments sumptuous; and that he entirely took\r\ndown a villa near the grove of Aricia, which he had built from the\r\nfoundation and finished at a vast expense, because it did not exactly\r\nsuit his taste, although he had at that time but slender means, and was\r\nin debt; and that he carried about in his expeditions tesselated and\r\nmarble slabs for the floor of his tent.\r\n\r\nXLVII.  They likewise report that he invaded Britain in hopes of finding\r\npearls [72], the size of which he would compare together, and ascertain\r\nthe weight by poising them in his hand; that he would purchase, at any\r\ncost, gems, carved works, statues, and pictures, executed by the eminent\r\nmasters of antiquity; and that he would give for young and handy slaves a\r\nprice so extravagant, that he forbad its being entered in the diary of\r\nhis expenses.\r\n\r\nXLVIII.  We are also told, that in the provinces he constantly maintained\r\ntwo tables, one for the officers of the army, and the gentry of the\r\ncountry, and the other for Romans of the highest rank, and provincials of\r\nthe first distinction.  He was so very exact in the management of his\r\ndomestic affairs, both little and great, that he once threw a baker into\r\nprison, for serving him with a finer sort of bread than his guests; and\r\nput to death a freed-man, who was a particular favourite, for debauching\r\nthe lady of a Roman knight, although no complaint had been made to him of\r\nthe affair.\r\n\r\nXLIX.  The only stain upon his chastity was his having cohabited with\r\nNicomedes; and that indeed stuck to him all the days of his life, and\r\nexposed him to much bitter raillery.  I will not dwell upon those\r\nwell-known verses of Calvus Licinius:\r\n\r\n    Whate’er Bithynia and her lord possess’d,\r\n    Her lord who Caesar in his lust caress’d. [73]\r\n\r\nI pass over the speeches of Dolabella, and Curio, the father, in which\r\nthe former calls him “the queen’s rival, and the inner-side of the royal\r\ncouch,” and the latter, “the brothel of Nicomedes, and the Bithynian\r\nstew.”  I would likewise say nothing of the edicts of Bibulus, in which\r\nhe proclaimed his colleague under the name of “the queen of Bithynia;”\r\n adding, that “he had formerly been in love with a king, but now coveted a\r\nkingdom.”  At which time, as Marcus Brutus relates, one Octavius, a man\r\nof a crazy brain, and therefore the more free in his raillery, after he\r\nhad in a crowded assembly saluted Pompey by the title of king, addressed\r\nCaesar by that of queen.  Caius Memmius likewise upbraided him with\r\nserving the king at table, among the rest of his catamites, in the\r\npresence of a large company, in which were some merchants from Rome, the\r\nnames of whom he mentions.  But Cicero was not content with writing in\r\nsome of his letters, that he was conducted by the royal attendants into\r\nthe king’s bed-chamber, lay upon a bed of gold with a covering of purple,\r\nand that the youthful bloom of this scion of Venus had been tainted in\r\nBithynia--but upon Caesar’s pleading the cause of Nysa, the daughter of\r\n(32) Nicomedes before the senate, and recounting the king’s kindnesses to\r\nhim, replied, “Pray tell us no more of that; for it is well known what he\r\ngave you, and you gave him.”  To conclude, his soldiers in the Gallic\r\ntriumph, amongst other verses, such as they jocularly sung on those\r\noccasions, following the general’s chariot, recited these, which since\r\nthat time have become extremely common:\r\n\r\n    The Gauls to Caesar yield, Caesar to Nicomede,\r\n    Lo!  Caesar triumphs for his glorious deed,\r\n    But Caesar’s conqueror gains no victor’s meed. [74]\r\n\r\nL.  It is admitted by all that he was much addicted to women, as well as\r\nvery expensive in his intrigues with them, and that he debauched many\r\nladies of the highest quality; among whom were Posthumia, the wife of\r\nServius Sulpicius; Lollia, the wife of Aulus Gabinius; Tertulla, the wife\r\nof Marcus Crassus; and Mucia, the wife of Cneius Pompey.  For it is\r\ncertain that the Curios, both father and son, and many others, made it a\r\nreproach to Pompey, “That to gratify his ambition, he married the\r\ndaughter of a man, upon whose account he had divorced his wife, after\r\nhaving had three children by her; and whom he used, with a deep sigh, to\r\ncall Aegisthus.” [75]  But the mistress he most loved, was Servilia, the\r\nmother of Marcus Brutus, for whom he purchased, in his first consulship\r\nafter the commencement of their intrigue, a pearl which cost him six\r\nmillions of sesterces; and in the civil war, besides other presents,\r\nassigned to her, for a trifling consideration, some valuable farms when\r\nthey were exposed to public auction.  Many persons expressing their\r\nsurprise at the lowness of the price, Cicero wittily remarked, “To let\r\nyou know the real value of the purchase, between ourselves, Tertia was\r\ndeducted:” for Servilia was supposed to have prostituted her daughter\r\nTertia to Caesar. [76]\r\n\r\n(34) LI.  That he had intrigues likewise with married women in the\r\nprovinces, appears from this distich, which was as much repeated in the\r\nGallic Triumph as the former:--\r\n\r\n    Watch well your wives, ye cits, we bring a blade,\r\n    A bald-pate master of the wenching trade.\r\n    Thy gold was spent on many a Gallic w---e;\r\n    Exhausted now, thou com’st to borrow more. [77]\r\n\r\nLII.  In the number of his mistresses were also some queens; such as\r\nEunoe, a Moor, the wife of Bogudes, to whom and her husband he made, as\r\nNaso reports, many large presents.  But his greatest favourite was\r\nCleopatra, with whom he often revelled all night until the dawn of day,\r\nand would have gone with her through Egypt in dalliance, as far as\r\nAethiopia, in her luxurious yacht, had not the army refused to follow\r\nhim.  He afterwards invited her to Rome, whence he sent her back loaded\r\nwith honours and presents, and gave her permission to call by his name a\r\nson, who, according to the testimony of some Greek historians, resembled\r\nCaesar both in person and gait.  Mark Antony declared in the senate, that\r\nCaesar had acknowledged the child as his own; and that Caius Matias,\r\nCaius Oppius, and the rest of Caesar’s friends knew it to be true.  On\r\nwhich occasion, Oppius, as if it had been an imputation which he was\r\ncalled upon to refute, published a book to shew, “that the child which\r\nCleopatra fathered upon Caesar, was not his.”  Helvius Cinna, tribune of\r\nthe people, admitted to several persons the fact, that he had a bill\r\nready drawn, which Caesar had ordered him to get enacted in his absence,\r\nallowing him, with the hope of leaving issue, to take any wife he chose,\r\nand as many of them as he pleased; and to leave no room for doubt of his\r\ninfamous character for unnatural lewdness and adultery, Curio, the\r\nfather, says, in one of his speeches, “He was every woman’s man, and\r\nevery man’s woman.”\r\n\r\nLIII.  It is acknowledged even by his enemies, that in regard to wine, he\r\nwas abstemious.  A remark is ascribed to Marcus Cato, “that Caesar was\r\nthe only sober man amongst all those who were engaged in the design to\r\nsubvert (35) the government.”  In the matter of diet, Caius Oppius\r\ninforms us, “that he was so indifferent, that when a person in whose\r\nhouse he was entertained, had served him with stale, instead of fresh,\r\noil [78], and the rest of the company would not touch it, he alone ate\r\nvery heartily of it, that he might not seem to tax the master of the\r\nhouse with rusticity or want of attention.”\r\n\r\nLIV.  But his abstinence did not extend to pecuniary advantages, either\r\nin his military commands, or civil offices; for we have the testimony of\r\nsome writers, that he took money from the proconsul, who was his\r\npredecessor in Spain, and from the Roman allies in that quarter, for the\r\ndischarge of his debts; and plundered at the point of the sword some\r\ntowns of the Lusitanians, notwithstanding they attempted no resistance,\r\nand opened their gates to him upon his arrival before them.  In Gaul, he\r\nrifled the chapels and temples of the gods, which were filled with rich\r\nofferings, and demolished cities oftener for the sake of their spoil,\r\nthan for any ill they had done.  By this means gold became so plentiful\r\nwith him, that he exchanged it through Italy and the provinces of the\r\nempire for three thousand sesterces the pound.  In his first consulship\r\nhe purloined from the Capitol three thousand pounds’ weight of gold, and\r\nsubstituted for it the same quantity of gilt brass.  He bartered likewise\r\nto foreign nations and princes, for gold, the titles of allies and kings;\r\nand squeezed out of Ptolemy alone near six thousand talents, in the name\r\nof himself and Pompey.  He afterwards supported the expense of the civil\r\nwars, and of his triumphs and public spectacles, by the most flagrant\r\nrapine and sacrilege.\r\n\r\nLV.  In eloquence and warlike achievements, he equalled at least, if he\r\ndid not surpass, the greatest of men.  After his prosecution of\r\nDolabella, he was indisputably reckoned one of the most distinguished\r\nadvocates.  Cicero, in recounting to Brutus the famous orators, declares,\r\n“that he does not see that Caesar was inferior to any one of them;” and\r\nsays, “that he (36) had an elegant, splendid, noble, and magnificent vein\r\nof eloquence.”  And in a letter to Cornelius Nepos, he writes of him in\r\nthe following terms: “What!  Of all the orators, who, during the whole\r\ncourse of their lives, have done nothing else, which can you prefer to\r\nhim?  Which of them is more pointed or terse in his periods, or employs\r\nmore polished and elegant language?”  In his youth, he seems to have\r\nchosen Strabo Caesar for his model; from whose oration in behalf of the\r\nSardinians he has transcribed some passages literally into his\r\nDivination.  In his delivery he is said to have had a shrill voice, and\r\nhis action was animated, but not ungraceful.  He has left behind him some\r\nspeeches, among which are ranked a few that are not genuine, such as that\r\non behalf of Quintus Metellus.  These Augustus supposes, with reason, to\r\nbe rather the production of blundering short-hand writers, who were not\r\nable to keep pace with him in the delivery, than publications of his own.\r\nFor I find in some copies that the title is not “For Metellus,” but “What\r\nhe wrote to Metellus;” whereas the speech is delivered in the name of\r\nCaesar, vindicating Metellus and himself from the aspersions cast upon\r\nthem by their common defamers.  The speech addressed “To his soldiers in\r\nSpain,” Augustus considers likewise as spurious.  We meet with two under\r\nthis title; one made, as is pretended, in the first battle, and the other\r\nin the last; at which time, Asinius Pollio says, he had not leisure to\r\naddress the soldiers, on account of the suddenness of the enemy’s attack.\r\n\r\nLVI.  He has likewise left Commentaries of his own actions both in the\r\nwar in Gaul, and in the civil war with Pompey; for the author of the\r\nAlexandrian, African, and Spanish wars is not known with any certainty.\r\nSome think they are the production of Oppius, and some of Hirtius; the\r\nlatter of whom composed the last book, which is imperfect, of the Gallic\r\nwar.  Of Caesar’s Commentaries, Cicero, in his Brutus, speaks thus: “He\r\nwrote his Commentaries in a manner deserving of great approbation: they\r\nare plain, precise, and elegant, without any affectation of rhetorical\r\nornament.  In having thus prepared materials for others who might be\r\ninclined to write his history, he may perhaps have encouraged some silly\r\ncreatures to enter upon such a work, who will needs be dressing up his\r\nactions in all the extravagance a (37) bombast; but he has discouraged\r\nwise men from ever attempting the subject.”  Hirtius delivers his opinion\r\nof these Commentaries in the following terms: “So great is the\r\napprobation with which they are universally perused, that, instead of\r\nrousing, he seems to have precluded, the efforts of any future historian.\r\nYet, with respect to this work, we have more reason to admire him than\r\nothers; for they only know how well and correctly he has written, but we\r\nknow, likewise, how easily and quickly he did it.”  Pollio Asinius thinks\r\nthat they were not drawn up with much care, or with a due regard to\r\ntruth; for he insinuates that Caesar was too hasty of belief in regard to\r\nwhat was performed by others under his orders; and that, he has not given\r\na very faithful account of his own acts, either by design, or through\r\ndefect of memory; expressing at the same time an opinion that Caesar\r\nintended a new and more correct edition.  He has left behind him likewise\r\ntwo books on Analogy, with the same number under the title of Anti-Cato,\r\nand a poem entitled The Itinerary.  Of these books, he composed the first\r\ntwo in his passage over the Alps, as he was returning to the army after\r\nmaking his circuit in Hither-Gaul; the second work about the time of the\r\nbattle of Munda; and the last during the four-and-twenty days he employed\r\nin his journey from Rome to Farther-Spain.  There are extant some letters\r\nof his to the senate, written in a manner never practised by any before\r\nhim; for they are distinguished into pages in the form of a memorandum\r\nbook whereas the consuls and commanders till then, used constantly in\r\ntheir letters to continue the line quite across the sheet, without any\r\nfolding or distinction of pages.  There are extant likewise some letters\r\nfrom him to Cicero, and others to his friends, concerning his domestic\r\naffairs; in which, if there was occasion for secrecy, he wrote in\r\ncyphers; that is, he used the alphabet in such a manner, that not a\r\nsingle word could be made out.  The way to decipher those epistles was to\r\nsubstitute the fourth for the first letter, as d for a, and so for the\r\nother letters respectively.  Some things likewise pass under his name,\r\nsaid to have been written by him when a boy, or a very young man; as the\r\nEncomium of Hercules, a tragedy entitled Oedipus, and a collection of\r\nApophthegms; all which Augustus forbad to be published, in a short and\r\nplain letter to Pompeius Macer, who was employed by him in the\r\narrangement of his libraries.\r\n\r\n(38) LVII.  He was perfect in the use of arms, an accomplished rider, and\r\nable to endure fatigue beyond all belief.  On a march, he used to go at\r\nthe head of his troops, sometimes on horseback, but oftener on foot, with\r\nhis head bare in all kinds of weather.  He would travel post in a light\r\ncarriage [79] without baggage, at the rate of a hundred miles a day; and\r\nif he was stopped by floods in the rivers, he swam across, or floated on\r\nskins inflated with wind, so that he often anticipated intelligence of\r\nhis movements. [80]\r\n\r\nLVIII.  In his expeditions, it is difficult to say whether his caution or\r\nhis daring was most conspicuous.  He never marched his army by roads\r\nwhich were exposed to ambuscades, without having previously examined the\r\nnature of the ground by his scouts.  Nor did he cross over to Britain,\r\nbefore he had carefully examined, in person [81], the navigation, the\r\nharbours, and the most convenient point of landing in the island.  When\r\nintelligence was brought to him of the siege of his camp in Germany, he\r\nmade his way to his troops, through the enemy’s stations, in a Gaulish\r\ndress.  He crossed the sea from Brundisium and Dyrrachium, in the winter,\r\nthrough the midst of the enemy’s fleets; and the troops, under orders to\r\njoin him, being slow in their movements, notwithstanding repeated\r\nmessages to hurry them, but to no purpose, he at last went privately, and\r\nalone, aboard a small vessel in the night time, with his head muffled up;\r\nnor did he make himself known, or suffer the master to put about,\r\nalthough the wind blew strong against them, until they were ready to\r\nsink.\r\n\r\nLIX.  He was never deterred from any enterprise, nor retarded in the\r\nprosecution of it, by superstition [82].  When a victim, which he was\r\nabout to offer in sacrifice, made its (39) escape, he did not therefore\r\ndefer his expedition against Scipio and Juba.  And happening to fall,\r\nupon stepping out of the ship, he gave a lucky turn to the omen, by\r\nexclaiming, “I hold thee fast, Africa.”  To chide the prophecies which\r\nwere spread abroad, that the name of the Scipios was, by the decrees of\r\nfate, fortunate and invincible in that province, he retained in the camp\r\na profligate wretch, of the family of the Cornelii, who, on account of\r\nhis scandalous life, was surnamed Salutio.\r\n\r\nLX.  He not only fought pitched battles, but made sudden attacks when an\r\nopportunity offered; often at the end of a march, and sometimes during\r\nthe most violent storms, when nobody could imagine he would stir.  Nor\r\nwas he ever backward in fighting, until towards the end of his life.  He\r\nthen was of opinion, that the oftener he had been crowned with success,\r\nthe less he ought to expose himself to new hazards; and that nothing he\r\ncould gain by a victory would compensate for what he might lose by a\r\nmiscarriage.  He never defeated the enemy without driving them from their\r\ncamp; and giving them no time to rally their forces.  When the issue of a\r\nbattle was doubtful, he sent away all the horses, and his own first, that\r\nhaving no means of flight, they might be under the greater necessity of\r\nstanding their ground.\r\n\r\nLXI.  He rode a very remarkable horse, with feet almost like those of a\r\nman, the hoofs being divided in such a manner as to have some resemblance\r\nto toes.  This horse he had bred himself, and the soothsayers having\r\ninterpreted these circumstances into an omen that its owner would be\r\nmaster of the world, he brought him up with particular care, and broke\r\nhim in himself, as the horse would suffer no one else to mount him.  A\r\nstatue of this horse was afterwards erected by Caesar’s order before the\r\ntemple of Venus Genitrix.\r\n\r\nLXII.  He often rallied his troops, when they were giving way, by his\r\npersonal efforts; stopping those who fled, keeping others in their ranks,\r\nand seizing them by their throat turned them towards the enemy; although\r\nnumbers were so terrified, that an eagle-bearer [83], thus stopped, made\r\na thrust at him with (40) the spear-head; and another, upon a similar\r\noccasion, left the standard in his hand.\r\n\r\nLXIII.  The following instances of his resolution are equally, and even\r\nmore remarkable.  After the battle of Pharsalia, having sent his troops\r\nbefore him into Asia, as he was passing the straits of the Hellespont in\r\na ferry-boat, he met with Lucius Cassius, one of the opposite party, with\r\nten ships of war; and so far from endeavouring to escape, he went\r\nalongside his ship, and calling upon him to surrender, Cassius humbly\r\ngave him his submission.\r\n\r\nLXIV.  At Alexandria, in the attack of a bridge, being forced by a sudden\r\nsally of the enemy into a boat, and several others hurrying in with him,\r\nhe leaped into the sea, and saved himself by swimming to the next ship,\r\nwhich lay at the distance of two hundred paces; holding up his left hand\r\nout of the water, for fear of wetting some papers which he held in it;\r\nand pulling his general’s cloak after him with his teeth, lest it should\r\nfall into the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nLXV.  He never valued a soldier for his moral conduct or his means, but\r\nfor his courage only; and treated his troops with a mixture of severity\r\nand indulgence; for he did not always keep a strict hand over them, but\r\nonly when the enemy was near.  Then indeed he was so strict a\r\ndisciplinarian, that he would give no notice of a march or a battle until\r\nthe moment of action, in order that the troops might hold themselves in\r\nreadiness for any sudden movement; and he would frequently draw them out\r\nof the camp without any necessity for it, especially in rainy weather,\r\nand upon holy-days.  Sometimes, giving them orders not to lose sight of\r\nhim, he would suddenly depart by day or by night, and lengthen the\r\nmarches in order to tire them out, as they followed him at a distance.\r\n\r\nLXVI.  When at any time his troops were dispirited by reports of the\r\ngreat force of the enemy, he rallied their courage; not by denying the\r\ntruth of what was said, or by diminishing the facts, but, on the\r\ncontrary, by exaggerating every particular.  (41) Accordingly, when his\r\ntroops were in great alarm at the expected arrival of king Juba, he\r\ncalled them together, and said, “I have to inform you that in a very few\r\ndays the king will be here, with ten legions, thirty thousand horse, a\r\nhundred thousand light-armed foot, and three hundred elephants.  Let none\r\nof you, therefore, presume to make further enquiry, or indulge in\r\nconjectures, but take my word for what I tell you, which I have from\r\nundoubted intelligence; otherwise I shall put them aboard an old crazy\r\nvessel, and leave them exposed to the mercy of the winds, to be\r\ntransported to some other country.”\r\n\r\nLXVII.  He neither noticed all their transgressions, nor punished them\r\naccording to strict rule.  But for deserters and mutineers he made the\r\nmost diligent enquiry, and their punishment was most severe: other\r\ndelinquencies he would connive at.  Sometimes, after a great battle\r\nending in victory, he would grant them a relaxation from all kinds of\r\nduty, and leave them to revel at pleasure; being used to boast, “that his\r\nsoldiers fought nothing the worse for being well oiled.”  In his\r\nspeeches, he never addressed them by the title of “Soldiers,” but by the\r\nkinder phrase of “Fellow-soldiers;” and kept them in such splendid order,\r\nthat their arms were ornamented with silver and gold, not merely for\r\nparade, but to render the soldiers more resolute to save them in battle,\r\nand fearful of losing them.  He loved his troops to such a degree, that\r\nwhen he heard of the defeat of those under Titurius, he neither cut his\r\nhair nor shaved his beard, until he had revenged it upon the enemy; by\r\nwhich means he engaged their devoted affection, and raised their valour\r\nto the highest pitch.\r\n\r\nLXVIII.  Upon his entering on the civil war, the centurions of every\r\nlegion offered, each of them, to maintain a horseman at his own expense,\r\nand the whole army agreed to serve gratis, without either corn or pay;\r\nthose amongst them who were rich, charging themselves with the\r\nmaintenance of the poor.  No one of them, during the whole course of the\r\nwar, deserted to the enemy; and many of those who were made prisoners,\r\nthough they were offered their lives, upon condition of bearing arms\r\nagainst him, refused to accept the terms.  They endured want, and other\r\nhardships, not only (42) when they were besieged themselves, but when\r\nthey besieged others, to such a degree, that Pompey, when blocked up in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Dyrrachium, upon seeing a sort of bread made of an\r\nherb, which they lived upon, said, “I have to do with wild beasts,” and\r\nordered it immediately to be taken away; because, if his troops should\r\nsee it, their spirit might be broken by perceiving the endurance and\r\ndetermined resolution of the enemy.  With what bravery they fought, one\r\ninstance affords sufficient proof; which is, that after an unsuccessful\r\nengagement at Dyrrachium, they called for punishment; insomuch that their\r\ngeneral found it more necessary to comfort than to punish them.  In other\r\nbattles, in different quarters, they defeated with ease immense armies of\r\nthe enemy, although they were much inferior to them in number.  In short,\r\none cohort of the sixth legion held out a fort against four legions\r\nbelonging to Pompey, during several hours; being almost every one of them\r\nwounded by the vast number of arrows discharged against them, and of\r\nwhich there were found within the ramparts a hundred and thirty thousand.\r\nThis is no way surprising, when we consider the conduct of some\r\nindividuals amongst them; such as that of Cassius Scaeva, a centurion, or\r\nCaius Acilius, a common soldier, not to speak of others.  Scaeva, after\r\nhaving an eye struck out, being run through the thigh and the shoulder,\r\nand having his shield pierced in an hundred and twenty places, maintained\r\nobstinately the guard of the gate of a fort, with the command of which he\r\nwas intrusted.  Acilius, in the sea-fight at Marseilles, having seized a\r\nship of the enemy’s with his right hand, and that being cut off, in\r\nimitation of that memorable instance of resolution in Cynaegirus amongst\r\nthe Greeks, boarded the enemy’s ship, bearing down all before him with\r\nthe boss of his shield.\r\n\r\nLXIX.  They never once mutinied during all the ten years of the Gallic\r\nwar, but were sometimes refractory in the course of the civil war.\r\nHowever, they always returned quickly to their duty, and that not through\r\nthe indulgence, but in submission to the authority, of their general; for\r\nhe never yielded to them when they were insubordinate, but constantly\r\nresisted their demands.  He disbanded the whole ninth legion with\r\nignominy at Placentia, although Pompey was still in arms, and would (43)\r\nnot receive them again into his service, until they had not only made\r\nrepeated and humble entreaties, but until the ringleaders in the mutiny\r\nwere punished.\r\n\r\nLXX.  When the soldiers of the tenth legion at Rome demanded their\r\ndischarge and rewards for their service, with violent threats and no\r\nsmall danger to the city, although the war was then raging in Africa, he\r\ndid not hesitate, contrary to the advice of his friends, to meet the\r\nlegion, and disband it.  But addressing them by the title of “Quirites,”\r\n instead of “Soldiers,” he by this single word so thoroughly brought them\r\nround and changed their determination, that they immediately cried out,\r\nthey were his “soldiers,” and followed him to Africa, although he had\r\nrefused their service.  He nevertheless punished the most mutinous among\r\nthem, with the loss of a third of their share in the plunder, and the\r\nland destined for them.\r\n\r\nLXXI.  In the service of his clients, while yet a young man, he evinced\r\ngreat zeal and fidelity.  He defended the cause of a noble youth,\r\nMasintha, against king Hiempsal, so strenuously, that in a scuffle which\r\ntook place upon the occasion, he seized by the beard the son of king\r\nJuba; and upon Masintha’s being declared tributary to Hiempsal, while the\r\nfriends of the adverse party were violently carrying him off, he\r\nimmediately rescued him by force, kept him concealed in his house a long\r\ntime, and when, at the expiration of his praetorship, he went to Spain,\r\nhe took him away in his litter, in the midst of his lictors bearing the\r\nfasces, and others who had come to attend and take leave of him.\r\n\r\nLXXII.  He always treated his friends with such kindness and good-nature,\r\nthat when Caius Oppius, in travelling with him through a forest, was\r\nsuddenly taken ill, he resigned to him the only place there was to\r\nshelter them at night, and lay upon the ground in the open air.  When he\r\nhad placed himself at the head of affairs, he advanced some of his\r\nfaithful adherents, though of mean extraction, to the highest offices;\r\nand when he was censured for this partiality, he openly said, “Had I been\r\nassisted by robbers and cut-throats in the defence of my honour, I should\r\nhave made them the same recompense.”\r\n\r\n(44) LXXIII.  The resentment he entertained against any one was never so\r\nimplacable that he did not very willingly renounce it when opportunity\r\noffered.  Although Caius Memmius had published some extremely virulent\r\nspeeches against him, and he had answered him with equal acrimony, yet he\r\nafterwards assisted him with his vote and interest, when he stood\r\ncandidate for the consulship.  When C. Calvus, after publishing some\r\nscandalous epigrams upon him, endeavoured to effect a reconciliation by\r\nthe intercession of friends, he wrote to him, of his own accord, the\r\nfirst letter.  And when Valerius Catullus, who had, as he himself\r\nobserved, fixed such a stain upon his character in his verses upon\r\nMamurra as never could be obliterated, he begged his pardon, invited him\r\nto supper the same day; and continued to take up his lodging with his\r\nfather occasionally, as he had been accustomed to do.\r\n\r\nLXXIV.  His temper was also naturally averse to severity in retaliation.\r\nAfter he had captured the pirates, by whom he had been taken, having\r\nsworn that he would crucify them, he did so indeed; but he first ordered\r\ntheir throats to be cut [84].  He could never bear the thought of doing\r\nany harm to Cornelius Phagitas, who had dogged him in the night when he\r\nwas sick and a fugitive, with the design of carrying him to Sylla, and\r\nfrom whose hands he had escaped with some difficulty by giving him a\r\nbribe.  Philemon, his amanuensis, who had promised his enemies to poison\r\nhim, he put to death without torture.  When he was summoned as a witness\r\nagainst Publicus Clodius, his wife Pompeia’s gallant, who was prosecuted\r\nfor the profanation of religious ceremonies, he declared he knew nothing\r\nof the affair, although his mother Aurelia, and his sister Julia, gave\r\nthe court an exact and full account of the circumstances.  And being\r\nasked why then he had divorced his wife?  “Because,” he said, “my family\r\nshould not only be free from guilt, but even from the suspicion of it.”\r\n\r\nLXXV.  Both in his administration and his conduct towards the vanquished\r\nparty in the civil war, he showed a wonderful moderation and clemency.\r\nFor while Pompey declared that he would consider those as enemies who did\r\nnot take arms in defence of the republic, he desired it to be understood,\r\nthat he (45) should regard those who remained neuter as his friends.\r\nWith regard to all those to whom he had, on Pompey’s recommendation,\r\ngiven any command in the army, he left them at perfect liberty to go over\r\nto him, if they pleased.  When some proposals were made at Ileria [85]\r\nfor a surrender, which gave rise to a free communication between the two\r\ncamps, and Afranius and Petreius, upon a sudden change of resolution, had\r\nput to the sword all Caesar’s men who were found in the camp, he scorned\r\nto imitate the base treachery which they had practised against himself.\r\nOn the field of Pharsalia, he called out to the soldiers “to spare their\r\nfellow-citizens,” and afterwards gave permission to every man in his army\r\nto save an enemy.  None of them, so far as appears, lost their lives but\r\nin battle, excepting only Afranius, Faustus, and young Lucius Caesar; and\r\nit is thought that even they were put to death without his consent.\r\nAfranius and Faustus had borne arms against him, after obtaining their\r\npardon; and Lucius Caesar had not only in the most cruel manner destroyed\r\nwith fire and sword his freed-men and slaves, but cut to pieces the wild\r\nbeasts which he had prepared for the entertainment of the people.  And\r\nfinally, a little before his death, he permitted all whom he had not\r\nbefore pardoned, to return into Italy, and to bear offices both civil and\r\nmilitary.  He even replaced the statues of Sylla and Pompey, which had\r\nbeen thrown down by the populace.  And after this, whatever was devised\r\nor uttered, he chose rather to check than to punish it.  Accordingly,\r\nhaving detected certain conspiracies and nocturnal assemblies, he went no\r\nfarther than to intimate by a proclamation that he knew of them; and as\r\nto those who indulged themselves in the liberty of reflecting severely\r\nupon him, he only warned them in a public speech not to persist in their\r\noffence.  He bore with great moderation a virulent libel written against\r\nhim by Aulus Caecinna, and the abusive lampoons of Pitholaus, most highly\r\nreflecting on his reputation.\r\n\r\nLXXVI.  His other words and actions, however, so far outweigh all his\r\ngood qualities, that it is thought he abused his power, and was justly\r\ncut off.  For he not only obtained excessive honours, such as the\r\nconsulship every year, the dictatorship for life, and the censorship, but\r\nalso the title of emperor [86], (46) and the surname of FATHER OF HIS\r\nCOUNTRY [87], besides having his statue amongst the kings [88], and a\r\nlofty couch in the theatre.  He even suffered some honours to be decreed\r\nto him, which were unbefitting the most exalted of mankind; such as a\r\ngilded chair of state in the senate-house and on his tribunal, a\r\nconsecrated chariot, and banners in the Circensian procession, temples,\r\naltars, statues among the gods, a bed of state in the temples, a priest,\r\nand a college of priests dedicated to himself, like those of Pan; and\r\nthat one of the months should be called by his name.  There were, indeed,\r\nno honours which he did not either assume himself, or grant to others, at\r\nhis will and pleasure.  In his third and fourth consulship, he used only\r\nthe title of the office, being content with the power of dictator, which\r\nwas conferred upon him with the consulship; and in both years he\r\nsubstituted other consuls in his room, during the three last months; so\r\nthat in the intervals he held no assemblies of the people, for the\r\nelection of magistrates, excepting only tribunes and ediles of the\r\npeople; and appointed officers, under the name of praefects, instead of\r\nthe praetors, to administer the affairs of the city during his absence.\r\nThe office of consul having become vacant, by the sudden death of one of\r\nthe consuls the day before the calends of January [the 1st Jan.], he\r\nconferred it on a person who requested it of him, for a few hours.\r\nAssuming the same licence, and regardless of the customs of his country,\r\nhe appointed magistrates to hold their offices for terms of years.  He\r\ngranted the insignia of the consular dignity to ten persons of pretorian\r\nrank.  He admitted into the senate some men who had been made free of the\r\ncity, and even natives of Gaul, who were semi-barbarians.  (47) He\r\nlikewise appointed to the management of the mint, and the public revenue\r\nof the state, some servants of his own household; and entrusted the\r\ncommand of three legions, which he left at Alexandria, to an old catamite\r\nof his, the son of his freed-man Rufinus.\r\n\r\nLXXVII.  He was guilty of the same extravagance in the language he\r\npublicly used, as Titus Ampius informs us; according to whom he said,\r\n“The republic is nothing but a name, without substance or reality.  Sylla\r\nwas an ignorant fellow to abdicate the dictatorship.  Men ought to\r\nconsider what is becoming when they talk with me, and look upon what I\r\nsay as a law.”  To such a pitch of arrogance did he proceed, that when a\r\nsoothsayer announced to him the unfavourable omen, that the entrails of a\r\nvictim offered for sacrifice were without a heart, he said, “The entrails\r\nwill be more favourable when I please; and it ought not to be regarded as\r\na prodigy that a beast should be found wanting a heart.”\r\n\r\nLXXVIII.  But what brought upon him the greatest odium, and was thought\r\nan unpardonable insult, was his receiving the whole body of the conscript\r\nfathers sitting, before the temple of Venus Genitrix, when they waited\r\nupon him with a number of decrees, conferring on him the highest\r\ndignities.  Some say that, on his attempting to rise, he was held down by\r\nCornelius Balbus; others, that he did not attempt to rise at all, but\r\nfrowned on Caius Trebatius, who suggested to him that he should stand up\r\nto receive the senate.  This behaviour appeared the more intolerable in\r\nhim, because, when one of the tribunes of the people, Pontius Aquila,\r\nwould not rise up to him, as he passed by the tribunes’ seat during his\r\ntriumph, he was so much offended, that he cried out, “Well then, you\r\ntribune, Aquila, oust me from the government.”  And for some days\r\nafterwards, he never promised a favour to any person, without this\r\nproviso, “if Pontus Aquila will give me leave.”\r\n\r\nLXXIX.  To this extraordinary mark of contempt for the senate, he added\r\nanother affront still more outrageous.  For when, after the sacred rites\r\nof the Latin festival, he was returning home, amidst the immoderate and\r\nunusual acclamations (48) of the people, a man in the crowd put a laurel\r\ncrown, encircled with a white fillet [89], on one of his statues; upon\r\nwhich, the tribunes of the people, Epidius Marullus, and Caesetius\r\nFlavus, ordered the fillet to be removed from the crown, and the man to\r\nbe taken to prison.  Caesar, being much concerned either that the idea of\r\nroyalty had been suggested to so little purpose, or, as was said, that he\r\nwas thus deprived of the merit of refusing it, reprimanded the tribunes\r\nvery severely, and dismissed them from their office.  From that day\r\nforward, he was never able to wipe off the scandal of affecting the name\r\nof king, although he replied to the populace, when they saluted him by\r\nthat title, “I am Caesar, and no king.”  And at the feast of the\r\nLupercalia [90], when the consul Antony placed a crown upon his head in\r\nthe rostra several times, he as often put it away, and sent it to the\r\nCapitol for Jupiter, the Best and the Greatest.  A report was very\r\ncurrent, that he had a design of withdrawing to Alexandria or Ilium,\r\nwhither he proposed to transfer the imperial power, to drain Italy by new\r\nlevies, and to leave the government of the city to be administered by his\r\nfriends.  To this report it was added, that in the next meeting of the\r\nsenate, Lucius Cotta, one of the fifteen [91], would make a motion, that\r\nas there was in the Sibylline books a prophecy, that the Parthians would\r\nnever be subdued but by a king, Caesar should have that title conferred\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nLXXX.  For this reason the conspirators precipitated the execution of\r\ntheir design [92], that they might not be obliged to give their assent to\r\nthe proposal.  Instead, therefore, of caballing any longer separately, in\r\nsmall parties, they now united their counsels; the people themselves\r\nbeing dissatisfied with the present state of affairs, both privately and\r\npublicly (49) condemning the tyranny under which they lived, and calling\r\non patriots to assert their cause against the usurper.  Upon the\r\nadmission of foreigners into the senate, a hand-bill was posted up in\r\nthese words: “A good deed! let no one shew a new senator the way to the\r\nhouse.”  These verses were likewise currently repeated:\r\n\r\n    The Gauls he dragged in triumph through the town,\r\n    Caesar has brought into the senate-house,\r\n    And changed their plaids [93] for the patrician gown.\r\n\r\n    Gallos Caesar in triumphum ducit: iidem in curiam\r\n    Galli braccas deposuerunt, latum clavum sumpserunt.\r\n\r\nWhen Quintus Maximus, who had been his deputy in the consulship for the\r\nlast three months, entered the theatre, and the lictor, according to\r\ncustom, bid the people take notice who was coming, they all cried out,\r\n“He is no consul.”  After the removal of Caesetius and Marullus from\r\ntheir office, they were found to have a great many votes at the next\r\nelection of consuls.  Some one wrote under the statue of Lucius Brutus,\r\n“Would you were now alive!” and under the statue of Caesar himself these\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n    Because he drove from Rome the royal race,\r\n    Brutus was first made consul in their place.\r\n    This man, because he put the consuls down,\r\n    Has been rewarded with a royal crown.\r\n\r\n    Brutus, quia reges ejecit, consul primus factus est:\r\n    Hic, quia consules ejecit, rex postremo factus est.\r\n\r\nAbout sixty persons were engaged in the conspiracy against him, of whom\r\nCaius Cassius, and Marcus and Decimus Brutus were the chief.  It was at\r\nfirst debated amongst them, whether they should attack him in the Campus\r\nMartius when he was taking the votes of the tribes, and some of them\r\nshould throw him off the bridge, whilst others should be ready to stab\r\nhim upon his fall; or else in the Via Sacra, or at the entrance of the\r\ntheatre.  But after public notice had been given by proclamation for the\r\nsenate to assemble upon the ides of March [15th March], in the\r\nsenate-house built by Pompey, they approved both of the time and place,\r\nas most fitting for their purpose.\r\n\r\nLXXXI.  Caesar had warning given him of his fate by indubitable (50)\r\nomens.  A few months before, when the colonists settled at Capua, by\r\nvirtue of the Julian law, were demolishing some old sepulchres, in\r\nbuilding country-houses, and were the more eager at the work, because\r\nthey discovered certain vessels of antique workmanship, a tablet of brass\r\nwas found in a tomb, in which Capys, the founder of Capua, was said to\r\nhave been buried, with an inscription in the Greek language to this\r\neffect “Whenever the bones of Capys come to be discovered, a descendant\r\nof Iulus will be slain by the hands of his kinsmen, and his death\r\nrevenged by fearful disasters throughout Italy.”  Lest any person should\r\nregard this anecdote as a fabulous or silly invention, it was circulated\r\nupon the authority of Caius Balbus, an intimate friend of Caesar’s.  A\r\nfew days likewise before his death, he was informed that the horses,\r\nwhich, upon his crossing the Rubicon, he had consecrated, and turned\r\nloose to graze without a keeper, abstained entirely from eating, and shed\r\nfloods of tears.  The soothsayer Spurinna, observing certain ominous\r\nappearances in a sacrifice which he was offering, advised him to beware\r\nof some danger, which threatened to befall him before the ides of March\r\nwere past.  The day before the ides, birds of various kinds from a\r\nneighbouring grove, pursuing a wren which flew into Pompey’s senate-house\r\n[94], with a sprig of laurel in its beak, tore it in pieces.  Also, in\r\nthe night on which the day of his murder dawned, he dreamt at one time\r\nthat he was soaring above the clouds, and, at another, that he had joined\r\nhands with Jupiter.  His wife Calpurnia fancied in her sleep that the\r\npediment of the house was falling down, and her husband stabbed on her\r\nbosom; immediately upon which the chamber doors flew open.  On account of\r\nthese omens, as well as his infirm health, he was in some doubt whether\r\nhe should not remain at home, and defer to some other opportunity the\r\nbusiness which he intended to propose to the senate; but Decimus Brutus\r\nadvising him not to disappoint the senators, who were numerously\r\nassembled, and waited his coming, he was prevailed upon to go, and\r\naccordingly (51) set forward about the fifth hour.  In his way, some\r\nperson having thrust into his hand a paper, warning him against the plot,\r\nhe mixed it with some other documents which he held in his left hand,\r\nintending to read it at leisure.  Victim after victim was slain, without\r\nany favourable appearances in the entrails; but still, disregarding all\r\nomens, he entered the senate-house, laughing at Spurinna as a false\r\nprophet, because the ides of March were come, without any mischief having\r\nbefallen him.  To which the soothsayer replied, “They are come, indeed,\r\nbut not past.”\r\n\r\nLXXXII.  When he had taken his seat, the conspirators stood round him,\r\nunder colour of paying their compliments; and immediately Tullius Cimber,\r\nwho had engaged to commence the assault, advancing nearer than the rest,\r\nas if he had some favour to request, Caesar made signs that he should\r\ndefer his petition to some other time.  Tullius immediately seized him by\r\nthe toga, on both shoulders; at which Caesar crying out, “Violence is\r\nmeant!” one of the Cassii wounded him a little below the throat.  Caesar\r\nseized him by the arm, and ran it through with his style [95]; and\r\nendeavouring to rush forward was stopped by another wound.  Finding\r\nhimself now attacked on all hands with naked poniards, he wrapped the\r\ntoga [96] about his head, and at the same moment drew the skirt round his\r\nlegs with his left hand, that he might fall more decently with the lower\r\npart of his body covered.  He was stabbed with three and twenty wounds,\r\nuttering a groan only, but no cry, at the first wound; although some\r\nauthors relate, that when Marcus Brutus fell upon him, he exclaimed,\r\n“What! art thou, too, one of them?  Thou, my son!” [97]  The whole\r\nassembly instantly (52) dispersing, he lay for some time after he\r\nexpired, until three of his slaves laid the body on a litter, and carried\r\nit home, with one arm hanging down over the side.  Among so many wounds,\r\nthere was none that was mortal, in the opinion of the surgeon Antistius,\r\nexcept the second, which he received in the breast.  The conspirators\r\nmeant to drag his body into the Tiber as soon as they had killed him; to\r\nconfiscate his estate, and rescind all his enactments; but they were\r\ndeterred by fear of Mark Antony, and Lepidus, Caesar’s master of the\r\nhorse, and abandoned their intentions.\r\n\r\nLXXXIII.  At the instance of Lucius Piso, his father-in-law, his will was\r\nopened and read in Mark Antony’s house.  He had made it on the ides\r\n[13th] of the preceding September, at his Lavican villa, and committed it\r\nto the custody of the chief of the Vestal Virgins.  Quintus Tubero\r\ninforms us, that in all the wills he had signed, from the time of his\r\nfirst consulship to the breaking out of the civil war, Cneius Pompey was\r\nappointed his heir, and that this had been publicly notified to the army.\r\nBut in his last will, he named three heirs, the grandsons of his sisters;\r\nnamely, Caius Octavius for three fourths of his estate, and Lucius\r\nPinarius and Quintus Pedius for the remaining fourth.  Other heirs [in\r\nremainder] were named at the close of the will, in which he also adopted\r\nCaius Octavius, who was to assume his name, into his family; and\r\nnominated most of those who were concerned in his death among the\r\nguardians of his son, if he should have any; as well as Decimus Brutus\r\namongst his heirs of the second order.  Be bequeathed to the Roman people\r\nhis gardens near the Tiber, and three hundred sesterces each man.\r\n\r\nLXXXIV.  Notice of his funeral having been solemnly proclaimed, a pile\r\nwas erected in the Campus Martius, near the tomb of his daughter Julia;\r\nand before the Rostra was placed a gilded tabernacle, on the model of the\r\ntemple of Venus Genitrix; within which was an ivory bed, covered with\r\npurple and cloth of gold.  At the head was a trophy, with the\r\n[bloodstained] robe in which he was slain.  It being considered that the\r\nwhole day would not suffice for carrying the funeral oblations in solemn\r\nprocession before the corpse, directions were given for every one,\r\nwithout regard to order, to carry them from the city into the Campus\r\nMartius, by what way they pleased.  To raise pity and indignation for his\r\nmurder, in the plays acted at the funeral, a passage was sung from\r\nPacuvius’s tragedy, entitled, “The Trial for Arms:”\r\n\r\n    That ever I, unhappy man, should save\r\n    Wretches, who thus have brought me to the grave! [98]\r\n\r\nAnd some lines also from Attilius’s tragedy of “Electra,” to the same\r\neffect.  Instead of a funeral panegyric, the consul Antony ordered a\r\nherald to proclaim to the people the decree of the senate, in which they\r\nhad bestowed upon him all honours, divine and human; with the oath by\r\nwhich they had engaged themselves for the defence of his person; and to\r\nthese he added only a few words of his own.  The magistrates and others\r\nwho had formerly filled the highest offices, carried the bier from the\r\nRostra into the Forum.  While some proposed that the body should be burnt\r\nin the sanctuary of the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and others in\r\nPompey’s senate-house; on a sudden, two men, with swords by their sides,\r\nand spears in their hands, set fire to the bier with lighted torches.\r\nThe throng around immediately heaped upon it dry faggots, the tribunals\r\nand benches of the adjoining courts, and whatever else came to hand.\r\nThen the musicians and players stripped off the dresses they wore on the\r\npresent occasion, taken from the wardrobe of his triumph at spectacles,\r\nrent them, and threw them into the flames.  The legionaries, also, of his\r\n(54) veteran bands, cast in their armour, which they had put on in honour\r\nof his funeral.  Most of the ladies did the same by their ornaments, with\r\nthe bullae [99], and mantles of their children.  In this public mourning\r\nthere joined a multitude of foreigners, expressing their sorrow according\r\nto the fashion of their respective countries; but especially the Jews\r\n[100], who for several nights together frequented the spot where the body\r\nwas burnt.\r\n\r\nLXXXV.  The populace ran from the funeral, with torches in their hands,\r\nto the houses of Brutus and Cassius, and were repelled with difficulty.\r\nGoing in quest of Cornelius Cinna, who had in a speech, the day before,\r\nreflected severely upon Caesar, and mistaking for him Helvius Cinna, who\r\nhappened to fall into their hands, they murdered the latter, and carried\r\nhis head about the city on the point of a spear.  They afterwards erected\r\nin the Forum a column of Numidian marble, formed of one stone nearly\r\ntwenty feet high, and inscribed upon it these words, TO THE FATHER OF HIS\r\nCOUNTRY.  At this column they continued for a long time to offer\r\nsacrifices, make vows, and decide controversies, in which they swore by\r\nCaesar.\r\n\r\nLXXXVI.  Some of Caesar’s friends entertained a suspicion, that he\r\nneither desired nor cared to live any longer, on account of his declining\r\nhealth; and for that reason slighted all the omens of religion, and the\r\nwarnings of his friends.  Others are of opinion, that thinking himself\r\nsecure in the late decree of the senate, and their oaths, he dismissed\r\nhis Spanish guards who attended him with drawn swords.  Others again\r\nsuppose, that he chose rather to face at once the dangers which\r\nthreatened him on all sides, than to be for ever on the watch against\r\nthem.  Some tell us that he used to say, the commonwealth was more\r\ninterested in the safety of his person than himself: for that he had for\r\nsome time been satiated with power and glory; but that the commonwealth,\r\nif any thing should befall him, would have no rest, and, involved in\r\nanother civil war, would be in a worse state than before.\r\n\r\n(55) LXXXVII.  This, however, was generally admitted, that his death was\r\nin many respects such as he would have chosen.  For, upon reading the\r\naccount delivered by Xenophon, how Cyrus in his last illness gave\r\ninstructions respecting his funeral, Caesar deprecated a lingering death,\r\nand wished that his own might be sudden and speedy.  And the day before\r\nhe died, the conversation at supper, in the house of Marcus Lepidus,\r\nturning upon what was the most eligible way of dying, he gave his opinion\r\nin favour of a death that is sudden and unexpected.\r\n\r\nLXXXVIII.  He died in the fifty-sixth year of his age, and was ranked\r\namongst the Gods, not only by a formal decree, but in the belief of the\r\nvulgar.  For during the first games which Augustus, his heir, consecrated\r\nto his memory, a comet blazed for seven days together, rising always\r\nabout eleven o’clock; and it was supposed to be the soul of Caesar, now\r\nreceived into heaven: for which reason, likewise, he is represented on\r\nhis statue with a star on his brow.  The senate-house in which he was\r\nslain, was ordered to be shut up [101], and a decree made that the ides\r\nof March should be called parricidal, and the senate should never more\r\nassemble on that day.\r\n\r\nLXXXIX.  Scarcely any of those who were accessary to his murder, survived\r\nhim more than three years, or died a natural death [102].  They were all\r\ncondemned by the senate: some were taken off by one accident, some by\r\nanother.  Part of them perished at sea, others fell in battle; and some\r\nslew themselves with the same poniard with which they had stabbed Caesar\r\n[103].\r\n\r\n(56) [104] The termination of the civil war between Caesar and Pompey\r\nforms a new epoch in the Roman History, at which a Republic, which had\r\nsubsisted with unrivalled glory during a period of about four hundred and\r\nsixty years, relapsed into a state of despotism, whence it never more\r\ncould emerge.  So sudden a transition from prosperity to the ruin of\r\npublic freedom, without the intervention of any foreign enemy, excites a\r\nreasonable conjecture, that the constitution in which it could take\r\nplace, however vigorous in appearance, must have lost that soundness of\r\npolitical health which had enabled it to endure through so many ages.  A\r\nshort view of its preceding state, and of that in which it was at the\r\ntime of the revolution now mentioned, will best ascertain the foundation\r\nof such a conjecture.\r\n\r\nThough the Romans, upon the expulsion of Tarquin, made an essential\r\nchange in the political form of the state, they did not carry their\r\ndetestation of regal authority so far as to abolish the religious\r\ninstitutions of Numa Pompilius, the second of their kings, according to\r\nwhich, the priesthood, with all the influence annexed to that order, was\r\nplaced in the hands of the aristocracy.  By this wise policy a restraint\r\nwas put upon the fickleness and violence of the people in matters of\r\ngovernment, and a decided superiority given to the Senate both in the\r\ndeliberative and executive parts of administration.  This advantage was\r\nafterwards indeed diminished by the creation of Tribunes of the people; a\r\nset of men whose ambition often embroiled the Republic in civil\r\ndissensions, and who at last abused their authority to such a degree,\r\nthat they became instruments of aggrandizement to any leading men in the\r\nstate who could purchase their friendship.  In general, however, the\r\nmajority of the Tribunes being actuated by views which comprehended the\r\ninterests of the multitude, rather than those of individuals, they did\r\nnot so much endanger the liberty, as they interrupted the tranquillity,\r\nof the public; and when the occasional commotions subsided, there\r\nremained no permanent ground for the establishment of personal\r\nusurpation.\r\n\r\nIn every government, an object of the last importance to the peace and\r\nwelfare of society is the morals of the people; and in proportion as a\r\ncommunity is enlarged by propagation, or the accession of a multitude of\r\nnew members, a more strict attention is requisite to guard against that\r\ndissolution of manners to which a crowded and extensive capital has a\r\nnatural tendency.  Of this (57) the Romans became sensible in the growing\r\nstate of the Republic.  In the year of the City 312, two magistrates were\r\nfirst created for taking an account of the number of the people, and the\r\nvalue of their estates; and soon after, they were invested with the\r\nauthority not only of inspecting the morals of individuals, but of\r\ninflicting public censure for any licentiousness of conduct, or violation\r\nof decency.  Thus both the civil and religious institutions concurred to\r\nrestrain the people within the bounds of good order and obedience to the\r\nlaws; at the same time that the frugal life of the ancient Romans proved\r\na strong security against those vices which operate most effectually\r\ntowards sapping the foundations of a state.\r\n\r\nBut in the time of Julius Caesar the barriers of public liberty were\r\nbecome too weak to restrain the audacious efforts of ambitious and\r\ndesperate men.  The veneration for the constitution, usually a powerful\r\ncheck to treasonable designs, had been lately violated by the usurpations\r\nof Marius and Sylla.  The salutary terrors of religion no longer\r\npredominated over the consciences of men.  The shame of public censure\r\nwas extinguished in general depravity.  An eminent historian, who lived\r\nat that time, informs us, that venality universally prevailed amongst the\r\nRomans; and a writer who flourished soon after, observes, that luxury and\r\ndissipation had encumbered almost all so much with debt, that they beheld\r\nwith a degree of complacency the prospect of civil war and confusion.\r\n\r\nThe extreme degree of profligacy at which the Romans were now arrived is\r\nin nothing more evident, than that this age gave birth to the most\r\nhorrible conspiracy which occurs in the annals of humankind, viz. that of\r\nCatiline.  This was not the project of a few desperate and abandoned\r\nindividuals, but of a number of men of the most illustrious rank in the\r\nstate; and it appears beyond doubt, that Julius Caesar was accessary to\r\nthe design, which was no less than to extirpate the Senate, divide\r\namongst themselves both the public and private treasures, and set Rome on\r\nfire.  The causes which prompted to this tremendous project, it is\r\ngenerally admitted, were luxury, prodigality, irreligion, a total\r\ncorruption of manners, and above all, as the immediate cause, the\r\npressing necessity in which the conspirators were involved by their\r\nextreme dissipation.\r\n\r\nThe enormous debt in which Caesar himself was early involved,\r\ncountenances an opinion that his anxiety to procure the province of Gaul\r\nproceeded chiefly from this cause.  But during nine years in which he\r\nheld that province, he acquired such riches as must have rendered him,\r\nwithout competition, the most opulent person in the state.  If nothing\r\nmore, therefore, than a (58) splendid establishment had been the object\r\nof his pursuit, he had attained to the summit of his wishes.  But when we\r\nfind him persevering in a plan of aggrandizement beyond this period of\r\nhis fortunes, we can ascribe his conduct to no other motive than that of\r\noutrageous ambition.  He projected the building of a new Forum at Rome,\r\nfor the ground only of which he was to pay 800,000 pounds; he raised\r\nlegions in Gaul at his own charges: he promised such entertainments to\r\nthe people as had never been known at Rome from the foundation of the\r\ncity.  All these circumstances evince some latent design of procuring\r\nsuch a popularity as might give him an uncontrolled influence in the\r\nmanagement of public affairs.  Pompey, we are told, was wont to say, that\r\nCaesar not being able, with all his riches, to fulfil the promises which\r\nhe had made, wished to throw everything into confusion.  There may have\r\nbeen some foundation for this remark: but the opinion of Cicero is more\r\nprobable, that Caesar’s mind was seduced with the temptations of\r\nchimerical glory.  It is observable that neither Cicero nor Pompey\r\nintimates any suspicion that Caesar was apprehensive of being impeached\r\nfor his conduct, had he returned to Rome in a private station.  Yet, that\r\nthere was reason for such an apprehension, the positive declaration of L.\r\nDomitius leaves little room to doubt: especially when we consider the\r\nnumber of enemies that Caesar had in the Senate, and the coolness of his\r\nformer friend Pompey ever after the death of Julia.  The proposed\r\nimpeachment was founded upon a notorious charge of prosecuting measures\r\ndestructive of the interests of the commonwealth, and tending ultimately\r\nto an object incompatible with public freedom.  Indeed, considering the\r\nextreme corruption which prevailed amongst the Romans at this time, it is\r\nmore than probable that Caesar would have been acquitted of the charge,\r\nbut at such an expense as must have stripped him of all his riches, and\r\nplaced him again in a situation ready to attempt a disturbance of the\r\npublic tranquillity.  For it is said, that he purchased the friendship of\r\nCurio, at the commencement of the civil war, with a bribe little short of\r\nhalf a million sterling.\r\n\r\nWhatever Caesar’s private motive may have been for taking arms against\r\nhis country, he embarked in an enterprise of a nature the most dangerous:\r\nand had Pompey conducted himself in any degree suitable to the reputation\r\nwhich he had formerly acquired, the contest would in all probability have\r\nterminated in favour of public freedom.  But by dilatory measures in the\r\nbeginning, by imprudently withdrawing his army from Italy into a distant\r\nprovince, and by not pursuing the advantage he had gained by the vigorous\r\nrepulse of Caesar’s troops in their attack upon his camp, this commander\r\nlost every opportunity of extinguishing a war which was to determine the\r\nfate, and even the existence, of the Republic.  It was accordingly\r\ndetermined on the plains of Pharsalia, where Caesar obtained a victory\r\nwhich was not more decisive than unexpected.  He was now no longer\r\namenable either to the tribunal of the Senate or the power of the laws,\r\nbut triumphed at once over his enemies and the constitution of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIt is to the honour of Caesar, that when he had obtained the supreme\r\npower, he exercised it with a degree of moderation beyond what was\r\ngenerally expected by those who had fought on the side of the Republic.\r\nOf his private life either before or after this period, little is\r\ntransmitted in history.  Henceforth, however, he seems to have lived\r\nchiefly at Rome, near which he had a small villa, upon an eminence,\r\ncommanding a beautiful prospect.  His time was almost entirely occupied\r\nwith public affairs, in the management of which, though he employed many\r\nagents, he appears to have had none in the character of actual minister.\r\nHe was in general easy of access: but Cicero, in a letter to a friend,\r\ncomplains of having been treated with the indignity of waiting a\r\nconsiderable time amongst a crowd in an anti-chamber, before he could\r\nhave an audience.  The elevation of Caesar placed him not above\r\ndischarging reciprocally the social duties in the intercourse of life.\r\nHe returned the visits of those who waited upon him, and would sup at\r\ntheir houses.  At table, and in the use of wine, he was habitually\r\ntemperate.  Upon the whole, he added nothing to his own happiness by all\r\nthe dangers, the fatigues, and the perpetual anxiety which he had\r\nincurred in the pursuit of unlimited power.  His health was greatly\r\nimpaired: his former cheerfulness of temper, though not his magnanimity,\r\nappears to have forsaken him; and we behold in his fate a memorable\r\nexample of illustrious talents rendered, by inordinate ambition,\r\ndestructive to himself, and irretrievably pernicious to his country.\r\n\r\nFrom beholding the ruin of the Roman Republic, after intestine divisions,\r\nand the distractions of civil war, it will afford some relief to take a\r\nview of the progress of literature, which flourished even during those\r\ncalamities.\r\n\r\nThe commencement of literature in Rome is to be dated from the reduction\r\nof the Grecian States, when the conquerors imported into their own\r\ncountry the valuable productions of the Greek language, and the first\r\nessay of Roman genius was in dramatic composition.  Livius Andronicus,\r\nwho flourished about 240 years before the Christian aera, formed the\r\nFescennine verses into a kind of regular drama, upon the model of the\r\nGreeks.  He was followed some time after by Ennius, who, besides dramatic\r\nand other compositions, (60) wrote the annals of the Roman Republic in\r\nheroic verse.  His style, like that of Andronicus, was rough and\r\nunpolished, in conformity to the language of those times; but for\r\ngrandeur of sentiment and energy of expression, he was admired by the\r\ngreatest poets in the subsequent ages.  Other writers of distinguished\r\nreputation in the dramatic department were Naevius, Pacuvius, Plautus,\r\nAfranius, Caecilius, Terence, Accius, etc.  Accius and Pacuvius are\r\nmentioned by Quintilian as writers of extraordinary merit.  Of\r\ntwenty-five comedies written by Plautus, the number transmitted to\r\nposterity is nineteen; and of a hundred and eight which Terence is said to\r\nhave translated from Menander, there now remain only six.  Excepting a few\r\ninconsiderable fragments, the writings of all the other authors have\r\nperished.  The early period of Roman literature was distinguished for the\r\nintroduction of satire by Lucilius, an author celebrated for writing with\r\nremarkable ease, but whose compositions, in the opinion of Horace, though\r\nQuintilian thinks otherwise, were debased with a mixture of feculency.\r\nWhatever may have been their merit, they also have perished, with the\r\nworks of a number of orators, who adorned the advancing state of letters\r\nin the Roman Republic.  It is observable, that during this whole period,\r\nof near two centuries and a half, there appeared not one historian of\r\neminence sufficient to preserve his name from oblivion.\r\n\r\nJulius Caesar himself is one of the most eminent writers of the age in\r\nwhich he lived.  His commentaries on the Gallic and Civil Wars are\r\nwritten with a purity, precision, and perspicuity, which command\r\napprobation.  They are elegant without affectation, and beautiful without\r\nornament.  Of the two books which he composed on Analogy, and those under\r\nthe title of Anti-Cato, scarcely any fragment is preserved; but we may be\r\nassured of the justness of the observations on language, which were made\r\nby an author so much distinguished by the excellence of his own\r\ncompositions.  His poem entitled The Journey, which was probably an\r\nentertaining narrative, is likewise totally lost.\r\n\r\nThe most illustrious prose writer of this or any other age is M. Tullius\r\nCicero; and as his life is copiously related in biographical works, it\r\nwill be sufficient to mention his writings.  From his earliest years, he\r\napplied himself with unremitting assiduity to the cultivation of\r\nliterature, and, whilst he was yet a boy, wrote a poem, called Glaucus\r\nPontius, which was extant in Plutarch’s time.  Amongst his juvenile\r\nproductions was a translation into Latin verse, of Aratus on the\r\nPhaenomena of the Heavens; of which many fragments are still extant.  He\r\nalso published a poem of the heroic kind, in honour of his countryman C.\r\nMarius, who was born at Arpinum, the birth-place of Cicero.  (61) This\r\nproduction was greatly admired by Atticus; and old Scaevola was so much\r\npleased with it, that in an epigram written on the subject, he declares\r\nthat it would live as long as the Roman name and learning subsisted.\r\nFrom a little specimen which remains of it, describing a memorable omen\r\ngiven to Marina from an oak at Arpinum, there is reason to believe that\r\nhis poetical genius was scarcely inferior to his oratorical, had it been\r\ncultivated with equal industry.  He published another poem called Limon,\r\nof which Donatus has preserved four lines in the life of Terence, in\r\npraise of the elegance and purity of that poet’s style.  He composed in\r\nthe Greek language, and in the style and manner of Isocrates, a\r\nCommentary or Memoirs of the Transactions of his Consulship.  This he\r\nsent to Atticus, with a desire, if he approved it, to publish it in\r\nAthens and the cities of Greece.  He sent a copy of it likewise to\r\nPosidonius of Rhodes, and requested of him to undertake the same subject\r\nin a more elegant and masterly manner.  But the latter returned for\r\nanswer, that, instead of being encouraged to write by the perusal of his\r\ntract, he was quite deterred from attempting it.\r\n\r\nUpon the plan of those Memoirs, he afterwards composed a Latin poem in\r\nthree books, in which he carried down the history to the end of his\r\nexile, but did not publish it for several years, from motives of\r\ndelicacy.  The three books were severally inscribed to the three Muses;\r\nbut of this work there now remain only a few fragments, scattered in\r\ndifferent parts of his other writings.  He published, about the same\r\ntime, a collection of the principal speeches which he had made in his\r\nconsulship, under the title of his Consular Orations.  They consisted\r\noriginally of twelve; but four are entirely lost, and some of the rest\r\nare imperfect.  He now published also, in Latin verse, a translation of\r\nthe Prognostics of Aratus, of which work no more than two or three small\r\nfragments now remain.  A few years after, he put the last hand to his\r\nDialogues upon the Character and Idea of the perfect Orator.  This\r\nadmirable work remains entire; a monument both of the astonishing\r\nindustry and transcendent abilities of its author.  At his Cuman villa,\r\nhe next began a Treatise on Politics, or on the best State of a City, and\r\nthe Duties of a Citizen.  He calls it a great and a laborious work, yet\r\nworthy of his pains, if he could succeed in it.  This likewise was\r\nwritten in the form of a dialogue, in which the speakers were Scipio,\r\nLaelius, Philus, Manilius, and other great persons in the former times of\r\nthe Republic.  It was comprised in six books, and survived him for\r\nseveral ages, though it is now unfortunately lost.  From the fragments\r\nwhich remain, it appears to have been a masterly production, in which all\r\nthe important questions in politics and morality were discussed with\r\nelegance and accuracy.\r\n\r\n(62) Amidst all the anxiety for the interests of the Republic, which\r\noccupied the thoughts of this celebrated personage, he yet found leisure\r\nto write several philosophical tracts, which still subsist, to the\r\ngratification of the literary world.  He composed a treatise on the\r\nNature of the Gods, in three books, containing a comprehensive view of\r\nreligion, faith, oaths, ceremonies, etc.  In elucidating this important\r\nsubject, he not only delivers the opinions of all the philosophers who\r\nhad written anything concerning it, but weighs and compares attentively\r\nall the arguments with each other; forming upon the whole such a rational\r\nand perfect system of natural religion, as never before was presented to\r\nthe consideration of mankind, and approaching nearly to revelation.  He\r\nnow likewise composed in two books, a discourse on Divination, in which\r\nhe discusses at large all the arguments that may be advanced for and\r\nagainst the actual existence of such a species of knowledge.  Like the\r\npreceding works, it is written in the form of dialogue, and in which the\r\nchief speaker is Laelius.  The same period gave birth to his treatise on\r\nOld Age, called Cato Major; and to that on Friendship, written also in\r\ndialogue, and in which the chief speaker is Laelius.  This book,\r\nconsidered merely as an essay, is one of the most entertaining\r\nproductions of ancient times; but, beheld as a picture drawn from life,\r\nexhibiting the real characters and sentiments of men of the first\r\ndistinction for virtue and wisdom in the Roman Republic, it becomes\r\ndoubly interesting to every reader of observation and taste.  Cicero now\r\nalso wrote his discourse on Fate, which was the subject of a conversation\r\nwith Hirtius, in his villa near Puteoli; and he executed about the same\r\ntime a translation of Plato’s celebrated Dialogue, called Timaeus, on the\r\nnature and origin of the universe.  He was employing himself also on a\r\nhistory of his own times, or rather of his own conduct; full of free and\r\nsevere reflections on those who had abused their power to the oppression\r\nof the Republic.  Dion Cassius says, that he delivered this book sealed\r\nup to his son, with strict orders not to read or publish it till after\r\nhis death; but from this time he never saw his son, and it is probable\r\nthat he left the work unfinished.  Afterwards, however, some copies of it\r\nwere circulated; from which his commentator, Asconius, has quoted several\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nDuring a voyage which he undertook to Sicily, he wrote his treatise on\r\nTopics, or the Art of finding Arguments on any Question.  This was an\r\nabstract from Aristotle’s treatise on the same subject; and though he had\r\nneither Aristotle nor any other book to assist him, he drew it up from\r\nhis memory, and finished it as he sailed along the coast of Calabria.\r\nThe last (63) work composed by Cicero appears to have been his Offices,\r\nwritten for the use of his son, to whom it is addressed.  This treatise\r\ncontains a system of moral conduct, founded upon the noblest principles\r\nof human action, and recommended by arguments drawn from the purest\r\nsources of philosophy.\r\n\r\nSuch are the literary productions of this extraordinary man, whose\r\ncomprehensive understanding enabled him to conduct with superior ability\r\nthe most abstruse disquisitions into moral and metaphysical science.\r\nBorn in an age posterior to Socrates and Plato, he could not anticipate\r\nthe principles inculcated by those divine philosophers, but he is justly\r\nentitled to the praise, not only of having prosecuted with unerring\r\njudgment the steps which they trod before him, but of carrying his\r\nresearches to greater extent into the most difficult regions of\r\nphilosophy.  This too he had the merit to perform, neither in the station\r\nof a private citizen, nor in the leisure of academic retirement, but in\r\nthe bustle of public life, amidst the almost constant exertions of the\r\nbar, the employment of the magistrate, the duty of the senator, and the\r\nincessant cares of the statesman; through a period likewise chequered\r\nwith domestic afflictions and fatal commotions in the Republic.  As a\r\nphilosopher, his mind appears to have been clear, capacious, penetrating,\r\nand insatiable of knowledge.  As a writer, he was endowed with every\r\ntalent that could captivate either the judgment or taste.  His researches\r\nwere continually employed on subjects of the greatest utility to mankind,\r\nand those often such as extended beyond the narrow bounds of temporal\r\nexistence.  The being of a God, the immortality of the soul, a future\r\nstate of rewards and punishments, and the eternal distinction of good and\r\nevil; these were in general the great objects of his philosophical\r\nenquiries, and he has placed them in a more convincing point of view than\r\nthey ever were before exhibited to the pagan world.  The variety and\r\nforce of the arguments which he advances, the splendour of his diction,\r\nand the zeal with which he endeavours to excite the love and admiration\r\nof virtue, all conspire to place his character, as a philosophical\r\nwriter, including likewise his incomparable eloquence, on the summit of\r\nhuman celebrity.\r\n\r\nThe form of dialogue, so much used by Cicero, he doubtless adopted in\r\nimitation of Plato, who probably took the hint of it from the colloquial\r\nmethod of instruction practised by Socrates.  In the early stage of\r\nphilosophical enquiry, this mode of composition was well adapted, if not\r\nto the discovery, at least to the confirmation of moral truth; especially\r\nas the practice was then not uncommon, for speculative men to converse\r\ntogether on important subjects, for mutual information.  In treating of\r\nany subject respecting which the different sects of philosophers differed\r\n(64) from each other in point of sentiment, no kind of composition could\r\nbe more happily suited than dialogue, as it gave alternately full scope\r\nto the arguments of the various disputants.  It required, however, that\r\nthe writer should exert his understanding with equal impartiality and\r\nacuteness on the different sides of the question; as otherwise he might\r\nbetray a cause under the appearance of defending it.  In all the\r\ndialogues of Cicero, he manages the arguments of the several disputants\r\nin a manner not only the most fair and interesting, but also such as\r\nleads to the most probable and rational conclusion.\r\n\r\nAfter enumerating the various tracts composed and published by Cicero, we\r\nhave now to mention his Letters, which, though not written for\r\npublication, deserve to be ranked among the most interesting remains of\r\nRoman literature.  The number of such as are addressed to different\r\ncorrespondents is considerable, but those to Atticus alone, his\r\nconfidential friend, amount to upwards of four hundred; among which are\r\nmany of great length.  They are all written in the genuine spirit of the\r\nmost approved epistolary composition; uniting familiarity with elevation,\r\nand ease with elegance.  They display in a beautiful light the author’s\r\ncharacter in the social relations of life; as a warm friend, a zealous\r\npatron, a tender husband, an affectionate brother, an indulgent father,\r\nand a kind master.  Beholding them in a more extensive view, they exhibit\r\nan ardent love of liberty and the constitution of his country: they\r\ndiscover a mind strongly actuated with the principles of virtue and\r\nreason; and while they abound in sentiments the most judicious and\r\nphilosophical, they are occasionally blended with the charms of wit, and\r\nagreeable effusions of pleasantry.  What is likewise no small addition to\r\ntheir merit, they contain much interesting description of private life,\r\nwith a variety of information relative to public transactions and\r\ncharacters of that age.  It appears from Cicero’s correspondence, that\r\nthere was at that time such a number of illustrious Romans, as never\r\nbefore existed in any one period of the Republic.  If ever, therefore,\r\nthe authority of men the most respectable for virtue, rank, and\r\nabilities, could have availed to overawe the first attempts at a\r\nviolation of public liberty, it must have been at this period; for the\r\ndignity of the Roman senate was now in the zenith of its splendour.\r\n\r\nCicero has been accused of excessive vanity, and of arrogating to himself\r\nan invidious superiority, from his extraordinary talents but whoever\r\nperuses his letters to Atticus, must readily acknowledge, that this\r\nimputation appears to be destitute of truth.  In those excellent\r\nproductions, though he adduces the strongest arguments for and against\r\nany object of consideration, that the (65) most penetrating understanding\r\ncan suggest, weighs them with each other, and draws from them the most\r\nrational conclusions, he yet discovers such a diffidence in his own\r\nopinion, that he resigns himself implicitly to the judgment and direction\r\nof his friend; a modesty not very compatible with the disposition of the\r\narrogant, who are commonly tenacious of their own opinion, particularly\r\nin what relates to any decision of the understanding.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say, whether Cicero appears in his letters more great\r\nor amiable: but that he was regarded by his contemporaries in both these\r\nlights, and that too in the highest degree, is sufficiently evident.  We\r\nmay thence infer, that the great poets in the subsequent age must have\r\ndone violence to their own liberality and discernment, when, in\r\ncompliment to Augustus, whose sensibility would have been wounded by the\r\npraises of Cicero, and even by the mention of his name, they have so\r\nindustriously avoided the subject, as not to afford the most distant\r\nintimation that this immortal orator and philosopher had ever existed.\r\nLivy however, there is reason to think, did some justice to his memory:\r\nbut it was not until the race of the Caesars had become extinct, that he\r\nreceived the free and unanimous applause of impartial posterity.  Such\r\nwas the admiration which Quintilian entertained of his writings, that he\r\nconsidered the circumstance or being delighted with them, as an\r\nindubitable proof of judgment and taste in literature.  Ille se\r\nprofecisse sciat, cui Cicero valde placebit. [105]\r\n\r\nIn this period is likewise to be placed M. Terentius Varro, the\r\ncelebrated Roman grammarian, and the Nestor of ancient learning.  The\r\nfirst mention made of him is, that he was lieutenant to Pompey in his\r\npiratical wars, and obtained in that service a naval crown.  In the civil\r\nwars he joined the side of the Republic, and was taken by Caesar; by whom\r\nhe was likewise proscribed, but obtained a remission of the sentence.  Of\r\nall the ancients, he has acquired the greatest fame for his extensive\r\nerudition; and we may add, that he displayed the same industry in\r\ncommunicating, as he had done in collecting it.  His works originally\r\namounted to no less than five hundred volumes, which have all perished,\r\nexcept a treatise De Lingua Latina, and one De Re Rustica.  Of the former\r\nof these, which is addressed to Cicero, three books at the beginning are\r\nalso lost.  It appears from the introduction of the fourth book, that\r\nthey all related to etymology.  The first contained such observations as\r\nmight be made against it; the second, such as might be made in its\r\nfavour; and the third, observations upon it.  He next proceeds to\r\ninvestigate the origin of (66) Latin words.  In the fourth book, he\r\ntraces those which relate to place; in the fifth, those connected with\r\nthe idea of time; and in the sixth, the origin of both these classes, as\r\nthey appear in the writings of the poets.  The seventh book is employed\r\non declension; in which the author enters upon a minute and extensive\r\nenquiry, comprehending a variety of acute and profound observations on\r\nthe formation of Latin nouns, and their respective natural declinations\r\nfrom the nominative case.  In the eighth, he examines the nature and\r\nlimits of usage and analogy in language; and in the ninth and last book\r\non the subject, takes a general view of what is the reverse of analogy,\r\nviz. anomaly.  The precision and perspicuity which Varro displays in this\r\nwork merit the highest encomiums, and justify the character given him in\r\nhis own time, of being the most learned of the Latin grammarians.  To the\r\nloss of the first three books, are to be added several chasms in the\r\nothers; but fortunately they happen in such places as not to affect the\r\ncoherency of the author’s doctrine, though they interrupt the\r\nillustration of it.  It is observable that this great grammarian makes\r\nuse of quom for quum, heis for his, and generally queis for quibus.  This\r\npractice having become rather obsolete at the time in which he wrote, we\r\nmust impute his continuance of it to his opinion of its propriety, upon\r\nits established principles of grammar, and not to any prejudice of\r\neducation, or an affectation of singularity.  As Varro makes no mention\r\nof Caesar’s treatise on Analogy, and had commenced author long before\r\nhim, it is probable that Caesar’s production was of a much later date;\r\nand thence we may infer, that those two writers differed from each other,\r\nat least with respect to some particulars on that subject.\r\n\r\nThis author’s treatise De Re Rustica was undertaken at the desire of a\r\nfriend, who, having purchased some lands, requested of Varro the favour\r\nof his instructions relative to farming, and the economy of a country\r\nlife, in its various departments.  Though Varro was at this time in his\r\neightieth year, he writes with all the vivacity, though without the\r\nlevity, of youth, and sets out with invoking, not the Muses, like Homer\r\nand Ennius, as he observes, but the twelve deities supposed to be chiefly\r\nconcerned in the operations of agriculture.  It appears from the account\r\nwhich he gives, that upwards of fifty Greek authors had treated of this\r\nsubject in prose, besides Hesiod and Menecrates the Ephesian, who both\r\nwrote in verse; exclusive likewise of many Roman writers, and of Mago the\r\nCarthaginian, who wrote in the Punic language.  Varro’s work is divided\r\ninto three books, the first of which treats of agriculture; the second,\r\nof rearing of cattle; and the third, of feeding animals for the use of\r\nthe table.  (67) In the last of these, we meet with a remarkable instance\r\nof the prevalence of habit and fashion over human sentiment, where the\r\nauthor delivers instructions relative to the best method of fattening\r\nrats.\r\n\r\nWe find from Quintilian, that Varro likewise composed satires in various\r\nkinds of verse.  It is impossible to behold the numerous fragments of\r\nthis venerable author without feeling the strongest regret for the loss\r\nof that vast collection of information which he had compiled, and of\r\njudicious observations which he had made on a variety of subjects, during\r\na life of eighty-eight years, almost entirely devoted to literature.  The\r\nremark of St. Augustine is well founded, That it is astonishing how\r\nVarro, who read such a number of books, could find time to compose so\r\nmany volumes; and how he who composed so many volumes, could be at\r\nleisure to peruse such a variety of books, and to gain so much literary\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nCatullus is said to have been born at Verona, of respectable parents; his\r\nfather and himself being in the habit of intimacy with Julius Caesar.  He\r\nwas brought to Rome by Mallius, to whom several of his epigrams are\r\naddressed.  The gentleness of his manners, and his application to study,\r\nwe are told, recommended him to general esteem; and he had the good\r\nfortune to obtain the patronage of Cicero.  When he came to be known as a\r\npoet, all these circumstances would naturally contribute to increase his\r\nreputation for ingenuity; and accordingly we find his genius applauded by\r\nseveral of his contemporaries.  It appears that his works are not\r\ntransmitted entire to posterity; but there remain sufficient specimens by\r\nwhich we may be enabled to appreciate his poetical talents.\r\n\r\nQuintilian, and Diomed the grammarian, have ranked Catullus amongst the\r\niambic writers, while others have placed him amongst the lyric.  He has\r\nproperly a claim to each of these stations; but his versification being\r\nchiefly iambic, the former of the arrangements seems to be the most\r\nsuitable.  The principal merit of Catullus’s Iambics consists in a\r\nsimplicity of thought and expression.  The thoughts, however, are often\r\nfrivolous, and, what is yet more reprehensible, the author gives way to\r\ngross obscenity: in vindication of which, he produces the following\r\ncouplet, declaring that a good poet ought to be chaste in his own person,\r\nbut that his verses need not be so.\r\n\r\n    Nam castum esse decet pium poetam\r\n    Ipsum: versiculos nihil necesse est.\r\n\r\nThis sentiment has been frequently cited by those who were inclined to\r\nfollow the example of Catullus; but if such a practice be in any case\r\nadmissible, it is only where the poet personates (68) a profligate\r\ncharacter; and the instances in which it is adopted by Catullus are not\r\nof that description.  It had perhaps been a better apology, to have\r\npleaded the manners of the times; for even Horace, who wrote only a few\r\nyears after, has suffered his compositions to be occasionally debased by\r\nthe same kind of blemish.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said of this poet’s invective against Caesar, which\r\nproduced no other effect than an invitation to sup at the dictator’s\r\nhouse.  It was indeed scarcely entitled to the honour of the smallest\r\nresentment.  If any could be shewn, it must have been for the freedom\r\nused by the author, and not for any novelty in his lampoon.  There are\r\ntwo poems on this subject, viz. the twenty-ninth and fifty-seventh, in\r\neach of which Caesar is joined with Mamurra, a Roman knight, who had\r\nacquired great riches in the Gallic war.  For the honour of Catullus’s\r\ngratitude, we should suppose that the latter is the one to which\r\nhistorians allude: but, as poetical compositions, they are equally\r\nunworthy of regard.  The fifty seventh is nothing more than a broad\r\nrepetition of the raillery, whether well or ill founded, with which\r\nCaesar was attacked on various occasions, and even in the senate, after\r\nhis return from Bithynia.  Caesar had been taunted with this subject for\r\nupwards of thirty years; and after so long a familiarity with reproach,\r\nhis sensibility to the scandalous imputation must now have been much\r\ndiminished, if not entirely extinguished.  The other poem is partly in\r\nthe same strain, but extended to greater length, by a mixture of common\r\njocular ribaldry of the Roman soldiers, expressed nearly in the same\r\nterms which Caesar’s legions, though strongly attached to his person,\r\nscrupled not to sport publicly in the streets of Rome, against their\r\ngeneral, during the celebration of his triumph.  In a word, it deserves\r\nto be regarded as an effusion of Saturnalian licentiousness, rather than\r\nof poetry.  With respect to the Iambics of Catullus, we may observe in\r\ngeneral, that the sarcasm is indebted for its force, not so much to\r\ningenuity of sentiment, as to the indelicate nature of the subject, or\r\ncoarseness of expression.\r\n\r\nThe descriptive poems of Catullus are superior to the others, and\r\ndiscover a lively imagination.  Amongst the best of his productions, is a\r\ntranslation of the celebrated ode of Sappho:\r\n\r\n    Ille mi par esse Deo videtur,\r\n    me, etc.\r\n\r\nThis ode is executed both with spirit and elegance; it is, however,\r\nimperfect; and the last stanza seems to be spurious.  Catullus’s epigrams\r\nare entitled to little praise, with regard either to sentiment or point;\r\nand on the whole, his merit, as a poet, appears to have been magnified\r\nbeyond its real extent.  He is said to have died about the thirtieth year\r\nof his age.\r\n\r\n(69) Lucretius is the author of a celebrated poem, in six books, De Rerum\r\nNatura; a subject which had been treated many ages before by Empedocles,\r\na philosopher and poet of Agrigentum.  Lucretius was a zealous partizan\r\nof Democritus, and the sect of Epicurus, whose principles concerning the\r\neternity of matter, the materiality of the soul, and the non-existence of\r\na future state of rewards and punishments, he affects to maintain with a\r\ncertainty equal to that of mathematical demonstration.  Strongly\r\nprepossessed with the hypothetical doctrines of his master, and ignorant\r\nof the physical system of the universe, he endeavours to deduce from the\r\nphenomena of the material world conclusions not only unsupported by\r\nlegitimate theory, but repugnant to the principles of the highest\r\nauthority in metaphysical disquisition.  But while we condemn his\r\nspeculative notions as degrading to human nature, and subversive of the\r\nmost important interests of mankind, we must admit that he has prosecuted\r\nhis visionary hypothesis with uncommon ingenuity.  Abstracting from it\r\nthe rhapsodical nature of this production, and its obscurity in some\r\nparts, it has great merit as a poem.  The style is elevated, and the\r\nversification in general harmonious.  By the mixture of obsolete words,\r\nit possesses an air of solemnity well adapted to abstruse researches; at\r\nthe same time that by the frequent resolution of diphthongs, it instils\r\ninto the Latin the sonorous and melodious powers of the Greek language.\r\n\r\nWhile Lucretius was engaged in this work, he fell into a state of\r\ninsanity, occasioned, as is supposed, by a philtre, or love-potion, given\r\nhim by his wife Lucilia.  The complaint, however, having lucid intervals,\r\nhe employed them in the execution of his plan, and, soon after it was\r\nfinished, laid violent hands upon himself, in the forty-third year of his\r\nage.  This fatal termination of his life, which perhaps proceeded from\r\ninsanity, was ascribed by his friends and admirers to his concern for the\r\nbanishment of one Memmius, with whom he was intimately connected, and for\r\nthe distracted state of the republic.  It was, however, a catastrophe\r\nwhich the principles of Epicurus, equally erroneous and irreconcilable to\r\nresignation and fortitude, authorized in particular circumstances.  Even\r\nAtticus, the celebrated correspondent of Cicero, a few years after this\r\nperiod, had recourse to the same desperate expedient, by refusing all\r\nsustenance, while he laboured under a lingering disease.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Cicero revised the poem of Lucretius after the death of\r\nthe author, and this circumstance is urged by the abettors of atheism, as\r\na proof that the principles contained in the work had the sanction of his\r\nauthority.  But no inference in favour of Lucretius’s doctrine can justly\r\nbe drawn from this circumstance.  (70) Cicero, though already\r\nsufficiently acquainted with the principles of the Epicurean sect, might\r\nnot be averse to the perusal of a production, which collected and\r\nenforced them in a nervous strain of poetry; especially as the work was\r\nlikely to prove interesting to his friend Atticus, and would perhaps\r\nafford subject for some letters or conversation between them.  It can\r\nhave been only with reference to composition that the poem was submitted\r\nto Cicero’s revisal: for had he been required to exercise his judgment\r\nupon its principles, he must undoubtedly have so much mutilated the work,\r\nas to destroy the coherency of the system.  He might be gratified with\r\nthe shew of elaborate research, and confident declamation, which it\r\nexhibited, but he must have utterly disapproved of the conclusions which\r\nthe author endeavoured to establish.  According to the best information,\r\nLucretius died in the year from the building of Rome 701, when Pompey was\r\nthe third time consul.  Cicero lived several years beyond this period,\r\nand in the two last years of his life, he composed those valuable works\r\nwhich contain sentiments diametrically repugnant to the visionary system\r\nof Epicurus.  The argument, therefore, drawn from Cicero’s revisal, so\r\nfar from confirming the principle of Lucretius, affords the strongest\r\ntacit declaration against their validity; because a period sufficient for\r\nmature consideration had elapsed, before Cicero published his own\r\nadmirable system of philosophy.  The poem of Lucretius, nevertheless, has\r\nbeen regarded as the bulwark of atheism--of atheism, which, while it\r\nimpiously arrogates the support of reason, both reason and nature\r\ndisclaim.\r\n\r\nMany more writers flourished in this period, but their works have totally\r\nperished.  Sallust was now engaged in historical productions; but as they\r\nwere not yet completed, they will be noticed in the next division of the\r\nreview.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD. OCTAVIUS CAESAR AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\n(71)\r\n\r\nI.  That the family of the Octavii was of the first distinction in\r\nVelitrae [106], is rendered evident by many circumstances.  For in the\r\nmost frequented part of the town, there was, not long since, a street\r\nnamed the Octavian; and an altar was to be seen, consecrated to one\r\nOctavius, who being chosen general in a war with some neighbouring\r\npeople, the enemy making a sudden attack, while he was sacrificing to\r\nMars, he immediately snatched the entrails of the victim from off the\r\nfire, and offered them half raw upon the altar; after which, marching out\r\nto battle, he returned victorious.  This incident gave rise to a law, by\r\nwhich it was enacted, that in all future times the entrails should be\r\noffered to Mars in the same manner; and the rest of the victim be carried\r\nto the Octavii.\r\n\r\nII.  This family, as well as several in Rome, was admitted into the\r\nsenate by Tarquinius Priscus, and soon afterwards placed by Servius\r\nTullius among the patricians; but in process of time it transferred\r\nitself to the plebeian order, and, after the lapse of a long interval,\r\nwas restored by Julius Caesar to the rank of patricians.  The first\r\nperson of the family raised by the suffrages of the people to the\r\nmagistracy, was Caius Rufus.  He obtained the quaestorship, and had two\r\nsons, Cneius and Caius; from whom are descended the two branches of the\r\nOctavian family, which have had very different fortunes.  For Cneius, and\r\nhis descendants in uninterrupted succession, held all the highest offices\r\nof the state; whilst Caius and his posterity, whether from their\r\ncircumstances or their choice, remained in the equestrian order until the\r\nfather of Augustus.  The great-grandfather of Augustus served as a\r\nmilitary tribune in the second Punic war in Sicily, under the command of\r\nAemilius Pappus.  His grandfather contented himself with bearing the\r\npublic offices of his own municipality, and grew old in the tranquil\r\nenjoyment of an ample patrimony.  Such is the account given (72) by\r\ndifferent authors.  Augustus himself, however, tells us nothing more than\r\nthat he was descended of an equestrian family, both ancient and rich, of\r\nwhich his father was the first who obtained the rank of senator.  Mark\r\nAntony upbraidingly tells him that his great-grandfather was a freedman\r\nof the territory of Thurium [107], and a rope-maker, and his grandfather\r\na usurer.  This is all the information I have any where met with,\r\nrespecting the ancestors of Augustus by the father’s side.\r\n\r\nIII.  His father Caius Octavius was, from his earliest years, a person\r\nboth of opulence and distinction: for which reason I am surprised at\r\nthose who say that he was a money-dealer [108], and was employed in\r\nscattering bribes, and canvassing for the candidates at elections, in the\r\nCampus Martius.  For being bred up in all the affluence of a great\r\nestate, he attained with ease to honourable posts, and discharged the\r\nduties of them with much distinction.  After his praetorship, he obtained\r\nby lot the province of Macedonia; in his way to which he cut off some\r\nbanditti, the relics of the armies of Spartacus and Catiline, who had\r\npossessed themselves of the territory of Thurium; having received from\r\nthe senate an extraordinary commission for that purpose.  In his\r\ngovernment of the province, he conducted himself with equal justice and\r\nresolution; for he defeated the Bessians and Thracians in a great battle,\r\nand treated the allies of the republic in such a manner, that there are\r\nextant letters from M. Tullius Cicero, in which he advises and exhorts\r\nhis brother Quintus, who then held the proconsulship of Asia with no\r\ngreat reputation, to imitate the example of his neighbour Octavius, in\r\ngaining the affections of the allies of Rome.\r\n\r\nIV.  After quitting Macedonia, before he could declare himself a\r\ncandidate for the consulship, he died suddenly, leaving behind him a\r\ndaughter, the elder Octavia, by Ancharia; and another daughter, Octavia\r\nthe younger, as well as Augustus, by Atia, who was the daughter of Marcus\r\nAtius Balbus, and Julia, sister to Caius Julius Caesar.  Balbus was, by\r\nthe father’s (73) side, of a family who were natives of Aricia [109], and\r\nmany of whom had been in the senate.  By the mother’s side he was nearly\r\nrelated to Pompey the Great; and after he had borne the office of\r\npraetor, was one of the twenty commissioners appointed by the Julian law\r\nto divide the land in Campania among the people.  But Mark Antony,\r\ntreating with contempt Augustus’s descent even by the mother’s side, says\r\nthat his great grand-father was of African descent, and at one time kept\r\na perfumer’s shop, and at another, a bake-house, in Aricia.  And Cassius\r\nof Parma, in a letter, taxes Augustus with being the son not only of a\r\nbaker, but a usurer.  These are his words: “Thou art a lump of thy\r\nmother’s meal, which a money-changer of Nerulum taking from the newest\r\nbake-house of Aricia, kneaded into some shape, with his hands all\r\ndiscoloured by the fingering of money.”\r\n\r\nV.  Augustus was born in the consulship of Marcus Tullius Cicero and\r\nCaius Antonius [110], upon the ninth of the calends of October [the 23rd\r\nSeptember], a little before sunrise, in the quarter of the Palatine Hill\r\n[111], and the street called The Ox-Heads [112], where now stands a\r\nchapel dedicated to him, and built a little after his death.  For, as it\r\nis recorded in the proceedings of the senate, when Caius Laetorius, a\r\nyoung man of a patrician family, in pleading before the senators for a\r\nlighter sentence, upon his being convicted of adultery, alleged, besides\r\nhis youth and quality, that he was the possessor, and as it were the\r\nguardian, of the ground which the Divine Augustus first touched upon his\r\ncoming into the world; and entreated that (74) he might find favour, for\r\nthe sake of that deity, who was in a peculiar manner his; an act of the\r\nsenate was passed, for the consecration of that part of his house in\r\nwhich Augustus was born.\r\n\r\nVI.  His nursery is shewn to this day, in a villa belonging to the\r\nfamily, in the suburbs of Velitrae; being a very small place, and much\r\nlike a pantry.  An opinion prevails in the neighbourhood, that he was\r\nalso born there.  Into this place no person presumes to enter, unless\r\nupon necessity, and with great devotion, from a belief, for a long time\r\nprevalent, that such as rashly enter it are seized with great horror and\r\nconsternation, which a short while since was confirmed by a remarkable\r\nincident.  For when a new inhabitant of the house had, either by mere\r\nchance, or to try the truth of the report, taken up his lodging in that\r\napartment, in the course of the night, a few hours afterwards, he was\r\nthrown out by some sudden violence, he knew not how, and was found in a\r\nstate of stupefaction, with the coverlid of his bed, before the door of\r\nthe chamber.\r\n\r\nVII.  While he was yet an infant, the surname of Thurinus was given him,\r\nin memory of the birth-place of his family, or because, soon after he was\r\nborn, his father Octavius had been successful against the fugitive\r\nslaves, in the country near Thurium.  That he was surnamed Thurinus, I\r\ncan affirm upon good foundation, for when a boy, I had a small bronze\r\nstatue of him, with that name upon it in iron letters, nearly effaced by\r\nage, which I presented to the emperor [113], by whom it is now revered\r\namongst the other tutelary deities in his chamber.  He is also often\r\ncalled Thurinus contemptuously, by Mark Antony in his letters; to which\r\nhe makes only this reply: “I am surprised that my former name should be\r\nmade a subject of reproach.”  He afterwards assumed the name of Caius\r\nCaesar, and then of Augustus; the former in compliance with the will of\r\nhis great-uncle, and the latter upon a motion of Munatius Plancus in the\r\nsenate.  For when some proposed to confer upon him the name of Romulus,\r\nas being, in a manner, a second founder of the city, it was resolved that\r\nhe should rather be called Augustus, a surname not only new, but of more\r\ndignity, because places devoted to religion, and those in which anything\r\n(75) is consecrated by augury, are denominated august, either from the\r\nword auctus, signifying augmentation, or ab avium gestu, gustuve, from\r\nthe flight and feeding of birds; as appears from this verse of Ennius:\r\n\r\n    When glorious Rome by august augury was built. [114]\r\n\r\nVIII.  He lost his father when he was only four years of age; and, in his\r\ntwelfth year, pronounced a funeral oration in praise of his grand-mother\r\nJulia.  Four years afterwards, having assumed the robe of manhood, he was\r\nhonoured with several military rewards by Caesar in his African triumph,\r\nalthough he took no part in the war, on account of his youth.  Upon his\r\nuncle’s expedition to Spain against the sons of Pompey, he was followed\r\nby his nephew, although he was scarcely recovered from a dangerous\r\nsickness; and after being shipwrecked at sea, and travelling with very\r\nfew attendants through roads that were infested with the enemy, he at\r\nlast came up with him.  This activity gave great satisfaction to his\r\nuncle, who soon conceived an increasing affection for him, on account of\r\nsuch indications of character.  After the subjugation of Spain, while\r\nCaesar was meditating an expedition against the Dacians and Parthians, he\r\nwas sent before him to Apollonia, where he applied himself to his\r\nstudies; until receiving intelligence that his uncle was murdered, and\r\nthat he was appointed his heir, he hesitated for some time whether he\r\nshould call to his aid the legions stationed in the neighbourhood; but he\r\nabandoned the design as rash and premature.  However, returning to Rome,\r\nhe took possession of his inheritance, although his mother was\r\napprehensive that such a measure might be attended with danger, and his\r\nstep-father, Marcius Philippus, a man of consular rank, very earnestly\r\ndissuaded him from it.  From this time, collecting together a strong\r\nmilitary force, he first held the government in conjunction with Mark\r\nAntony and Marcus Lepidus, then with Antony only, for nearly twelve\r\nyears, and at last in his own hands during a period of four and forty.\r\n\r\nIX.  Having thus given a very short summary of his life, I shall\r\nprosecute the several parts of it, not in order of time, but arranging\r\nhis acts into distinct classes, for the sake of (76) perspicuity.  He was\r\nengaged in five civil wars, namely those of Modena, Philippi, Perugia,\r\nSicily, and Actium; the first and last of which were against Antony, and\r\nthe second against Brutus and Cassius; the third against Lucius Antonius,\r\nthe triumvir’s brother, and the fourth against Sextus Pompeius, the son\r\nof Cneius Pompeius.\r\n\r\nX.  The motive which gave rise to all these wars was the opinion he\r\nentertained that both his honour and interest were concerned in revenging\r\nthe murder of his uncle, and maintaining the state of affairs he had\r\nestablished.  Immediately after his return from Apollonia, he formed the\r\ndesign of taking forcible and unexpected measures against Brutus and\r\nCassius; but they having foreseen the danger and made their escape, he\r\nresolved to proceed against them by an appeal to the laws in their\r\nabsence, and impeach them for the murder.  In the mean time, those whose\r\nprovince it was to prepare the sports in honour of Caesar’s last victory\r\nin the civil war, not daring to do it, he undertook it himself.  And that\r\nhe might carry into effect his other designs with greater authority, he\r\ndeclared himself a candidate in the room of a tribune of the people who\r\nhappened to die at that time, although he was of a patrician family, and\r\nhad not yet been in the senate.  But the consul, Mark Antony, from whom\r\nhe had expected the greatest assistance, opposing him in his suit, and\r\neven refusing to do him so much as common justice, unless gratified with\r\na large bribe, he went over to the party of the nobles, to whom he\r\nperceived Sylla to be odious, chiefly for endeavouring to drive Decius\r\nBrutus, whom he besieged in the town of Modena, out of the province,\r\nwhich had been given him by Caesar, and confirmed to him by the senate.\r\nAt the instigation of persons about him, he engaged some ruffians to\r\nmurder his antagonist; but the plot being discovered, and dreading a\r\nsimilar attempt upon himself, he gained over Caesar’s veteran soldiers,\r\nby distributing among them all the money he could collect.  Being now\r\ncommissioned by the senate to command the troops he had gathered, with\r\nthe rank of praetor, and in conjunction with Hirtius and Pansa, who had\r\naccepted the consulship, to carry assistance to Decius Brutus, he put an\r\nend to the war by two battles in three months.  Antony writes, that in\r\nthe former of these he ran away, and two days afterwards made his\r\nappearance (77) without his general’s cloak and his horse.  In the last\r\nbattle, however, it is certain that he performed the part not only of a\r\ngeneral, but a soldier; for, in the heat of the battle; when the\r\nstandard-bearer of his legion was severely wounded, he took the eagle\r\nupon his shoulders, and carried it a long time.\r\n\r\nXI.  In this war [115], Hirtius being slain in battle, and Pansa dying a\r\nshort time afterwards of a wound, a report was circulated that they both\r\nwere killed through his means, in order that, when Antony fled, the\r\nrepublic having lost its consuls, he might have the victorious armies\r\nentirely at his own command.  The death of Pansa was so fully believed to\r\nhave been caused by undue means, that Glyco, his surgeon, was placed in\r\ncustody, on a suspicion of having poisoned his wound.  And to this,\r\nAquilius Niger adds, that he killed Hirtius, the other consul, in the\r\nconfusion of the battle, with his own hands.\r\n\r\nXII.  But upon intelligence that Antony, after his defeat, had been\r\nreceived by Marcus Lepidus, and that the rest of the generals and armies\r\nhad all declared for the senate, he, without any hesitation, deserted\r\nfrom the party of the nobles; alleging as an excuse for his conduct, the\r\nactions and sayings of several amongst them; for some said, “he was a\r\nmere boy,” and others threw out, “that he ought to be promoted to\r\nhonours, and cut off,” to avoid the making any suitable acknowledgment\r\neither to him or the veteran legions.  And the more to testify his regret\r\nfor having before attached himself to the other faction, he fined the\r\nNursini in a large sum of money, which they were unable to pay, and then\r\nexpelled them from the town, for having inscribed upon a monument,\r\nerected at the public charge to their countrymen who were slain in the\r\nbattle of Modena, “That they fell in the cause of liberty.”\r\n\r\nXIII.  Having entered into a confederacy with Antony and Lepidus, he\r\nbrought the war at Philippi to an end in two battles, although he was at\r\nthat time weak, and suffering from sickness [116].  In the first battle\r\nhe was driven from his camp, (78) and with some difficulty made his\r\nescape to the wing of the army commanded by Antony.  And now, intoxicated\r\nwith success, he sent the head of Brutus [117] to be cast at the foot of\r\nCaesar’s statue, and treated the most illustrious of the prisoners not\r\nonly with cruelty, but with abusive language; insomuch that he is said to\r\nhave answered one of them who humbly intreated that at least he might not\r\nremain unburied, “That will be in the power of the birds.”  Two others,\r\nfather and son, who begged for their lives, he ordered to cast lots which\r\nof them should live, or settle it between themselves by the sword; and\r\nwas a spectator of both their deaths: for the father offering his life to\r\nsave his son, and being accordingly executed, the son likewise killed\r\nhimself upon the spot.  On this account, the rest of the prisoners, and\r\namongst them Marcus Favonius, Cato’s rival, being led up in fetters,\r\nafter they had saluted Antony, the general, with much respect, reviled\r\nOctavius in the foulest language.  After this victory, dividing between\r\nthem the offices of the state, Mark Antony [118] undertook to restore\r\norder in the east, while Caesar conducted the veteran soldiers back to\r\nItaly, and settled them in colonies on the lands belonging to the\r\nmunicipalities.  But he had the misfortune to please neither the soldiers\r\nnor the owners of the lands; one party complaining of the injustice done\r\nthem, in being violently ejected from their possessions, and the other,\r\nthat they were not rewarded according to their merit. [119]\r\n\r\nXIV.  At this time he obliged Lucius Antony, who, presuming upon his own\r\nauthority as consul, and his brother’s power, was raising new commotions,\r\nto fly to Perugia, and forced him, by famine, to surrender at last,\r\nalthough not without having been exposed to great hazards, both before\r\nthe war and during its continuance.  For a common soldier having got into\r\nthe seats of the equestrian order in the theatre, at the public\r\nspectacles, Caesar ordered him to be removed by an officer; and a rumour\r\nbeing thence spread by his enemies, that he had (79) put the man to death\r\nby torture, the soldiers flocked together so much enraged, that he\r\nnarrowly escaped with his life.  The only thing that saved him, was the\r\nsudden appearance of the man, safe and sound, no violence having been\r\noffered him.  And whilst he was sacrificing under the walls of Perugia,\r\nhe nearly fell into the hands of a body of gladiators, who sallied out of\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nXV.  After the taking of Perugia [120], he sentenced a great number of\r\nthe prisoners to death, making only one reply to all who implored pardon,\r\nor endeavoured to excuse themselves, “You must die.”  Some authors write,\r\nthat three hundred of the two orders, selected from the rest, were\r\nslaughtered, like victims, before an altar raised to Julius Caesar, upon\r\nthe ides of March [15th April] [121].  Nay, there are some who relate,\r\nthat he entered upon the war with no other view, than that his secret\r\nenemies, and those whom fear more than affection kept quiet, might be\r\ndetected, by declaring themselves, now they had an opportunity, with\r\nLucius Antony at their head; and that having defeated them, and\r\nconfiscated their estates, he might be enabled to fulfil his promises to\r\nthe veteran soldiers.\r\n\r\nXVI.  He soon commenced the Sicilian war, but it was protracted by\r\nvarious delays during a long period [122]; at one time for the purpose of\r\nrepairing his fleets, which he lost twice by storm, even in the summer;\r\nat another, while patching up a peace, to which he was forced by the\r\nclamours of the people, in consequence of a famine occasioned by Pompey’s\r\ncutting off the supply of corn by sea.  But at last, having built a new\r\nfleet, and obtained twenty thousand manumitted slaves [123], who were\r\ngiven him for the oar, he formed the Julian harbour at Baiae, by letting\r\nthe sea into the Lucrine and Avernian lakes; and having exercised his\r\nforces there during the whole winter, he defeated Pompey betwixt Mylae\r\nand Naulochus; although (80) just as the engagement commenced, he\r\nsuddenly fell into such a profound sleep, that his friends were obliged\r\nto wake him to give the signal.  This, I suppose, gave occasion for\r\nAntony’s reproach: “You were not able to take a clear view of the fleet,\r\nwhen drawn up in line of battle, but lay stupidly upon your back, gazing\r\nat the sky; nor did you get up and let your men see you, until Marcus\r\nAgrippa had forced the enemies’ ships to sheer off.”  Others imputed to\r\nhim both a saying and an action which were indefensible; for, upon the\r\nloss of his fleets by storm, he is reported to have said: “I will conquer\r\nin spite of Neptune;” and at the next Circensian games, he would not\r\nsuffer the statue of that God to be carried in procession as usual.\r\nIndeed he scarcely ever ran more or greater risks in any of his wars than\r\nin this.  Having transported part of his army to Sicily, and being on his\r\nreturn for the rest, he was unexpectedly attacked by Demochares and\r\nApollophanes, Pompey’s admirals, from whom he escaped with great\r\ndifficulty, and with one ship only.  Likewise, as he was travelling on\r\nfoot through the Locrian territory to Rhegium, seeing two of Pompey’s\r\nvessels passing by that coast, and supposing them to be his own, he went\r\ndown to the shore, and was very nearly taken prisoner.  On this occasion,\r\nas he was making his escape by some bye-ways, a slave belonging to\r\nAemilius Paulus, who accompanied him, owing him a grudge for the\r\nproscription of Paulus, the father of Aemilius, and thinking he had now\r\nan opportunity of revenging it, attempted to assassinate him.  After the\r\ndefeat of Pompey, one of his colleagues [124], Marcus Lepidus, whom he\r\nhad summoned to his aid from Africa, affecting great superiority, because\r\nhe was at the head of twenty legions, and claiming for himself the\r\nprincipal management of affairs in a threatening manner, he divested him\r\nof his command, but, upon his humble submission, granted him his life,\r\nbut banished him for life to Circeii.\r\n\r\nXVII.  The alliance between him and Antony, which had always been\r\nprecarious, often interrupted, and ill cemented by repeated\r\nreconciliations, he at last entirely dissolved.  And to make it known to\r\nthe world how far Antony had degenerated from patriotic feelings, he\r\ncaused a will of his, which had been left at Rome, and in which he had\r\nnominated Cleopatra’s children, amongst others, as his heirs, to be\r\nopened and read in an assembly of the people.  Yet upon his being\r\ndeclared an enemy, he sent to him all his relations and friends, among\r\nwhom were Caius Sosius and Titus Domitius, at that time consuls.  He\r\nlikewise spoke favourably in public of the people of Bologna, for joining\r\nin the association with the rest of Italy to support his cause, because\r\nthey had, in former times, been under the protection of the family of the\r\nAntonii.  And not long afterwards he defeated him in a naval engagement\r\nnear Actium, which was prolonged to so late an hour, that, after the\r\nvictory, he was obliged to sleep on board his ship.  From Actium he went\r\nto the isle of Samoa to winter; but being alarmed with the accounts of a\r\nmutiny amongst the soldiers he had selected from the main body of his\r\narmy sent to Brundisium after the victory, who insisted on their being\r\nrewarded for their service and discharged, he returned to Italy.  In his\r\npassage thither, he encountered two violent storms, the first between the\r\npromontories of Peloponnesus and Aetolia, and the other about the\r\nCeraunian mountains; in both which a part of his Liburnian squadron was\r\nsunk, the spars and rigging of his own ship carried away, and the rudder\r\nbroken in pieces.  He remained only twenty-seven days at Brundisium,\r\nuntil the demands of the soldiers were settled, and then went, by way of\r\nAsia and Syria, to Egypt, where laying siege to Alexandria, whither\r\nAntony had fled with Cleopatra, he made himself master of it in a short\r\ntime.  He drove Antony to kill himself, after he had used every effort to\r\nobtain conditions of peace, and he saw his corpse [126].  Cleopatra he\r\nanxiously wished to save for his triumph; and when she was supposed to\r\nhave been bit to death by an asp, he sent for the Psylli [127] to (82)\r\nendeavour to suck out the poison.  He allowed them to be buried together\r\nin the same grave, and ordered a mausoleum, begun by themselves, to be\r\ncompleted.  The eldest of Antony’s two sons by Fulvia he commanded to be\r\ntaken by force from the statue of Julius Caesar, to which he had fled,\r\nafter many fruitless supplications for his life, and put him to death.\r\nThe same fate attended Caesario, Cleopatra’s son by Caesar, as he\r\npretended, who had fled for his life, but was retaken.  The children\r\nwhich Antony had by Cleopatra he saved, and brought up and cherished in a\r\nmanner suitable to their rank, just as if they had been his own\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nXVIII.  At this time he had a desire to see the sarcophagus and body of\r\nAlexander the Great, which, for that purpose, were taken out of the cell\r\nin which they rested [128]; and after viewing them for some time, he paid\r\nhonours to the memory of that prince, by offering a golden crown, and\r\nscattering flowers upon the body [129].  Being asked if he wished to see\r\nthe tombs of the Ptolemies also; he replied, “I wish to see a king, not\r\ndead men.” [130]  He reduced Egypt into the form of a province and to\r\nrender it more fertile, and more capable of supplying Rome with corn, he\r\nemployed his army to scour the canals, into which the Nile, upon its\r\nrise, discharges itself; but which during a long series of years had\r\nbecome nearly choked up with mud.  To perpetuate the glory of his victory\r\nat Actium, he built the city of Nicopolis on that part of the coast, and\r\nestablished games to be celebrated there every five years; enlarging\r\nlikewise an old temple of Apollo, he ornamented with naval trophies [131]\r\nthe spot on which he had pitched his camp, and consecrated it to Neptune\r\nand Mars.\r\n\r\n(83) XIX.  He afterwards [132] quashed several tumults and insurrections,\r\nas well as several conspiracies against his life, which were discovered,\r\nby the confession of accomplices, before they were ripe for execution;\r\nand others subsequently.  Such were those of the younger Lepidus, of\r\nVarro Muraena, and Fannius Caepio; then that of Marcus Egnatius,\r\nafterwards that of Plautius Rufus, and of Lucius Paulus, his\r\ngrand-daughter’s husband; and besides these, another of Lucius Audasius,\r\nan old feeble man, who was under prosecution for forgery; as also of\r\nAsinius Epicadus, a Parthinian mongrel [133], and at last that of\r\nTelephus, a lady’s prompter [134]; for he was in danger of his life from\r\nthe plots and conspiracies of some of the lowest of the people against\r\nhim. Audasius and Epicadus had formed the design of carrying off to the\r\narmies his daughter Julia, and his grandson Agrippa, from the islands in\r\nwhich they were confined.  Telephus, wildly dreaming that the government\r\nwas destined to him by the fates, proposed to fall both upon Octavius and\r\nthe senate.  Nay, once, a soldier’s servant belonging to the army in\r\nIllyricum, having passed the porters unobserved, was found in the\r\nnight-time standing before his chamber-door, armed with a hunting-dagger.\r\nWhether the person was really disordered in the head, or only\r\ncounterfeited madness, is uncertain; for no confession was obtained from\r\nhim by torture.\r\n\r\nXX.  He conducted in person only two foreign wars; the Dalmatian, whilst\r\nhe was yet but a youth; and, after Antony’s final defeat, the Cantabrian.\r\nHe was wounded in the former of these wars; in one battle he received a\r\ncontusion in the right knee from a stone--and in another, he was much\r\nhurt in (84) one leg and both arms, by the fall of a fridge [135].  His\r\nother wars he carried on by his lieutenants; but occasionally visited the\r\narmy, in some of the wars of Pannonia and Germany, or remained at no\r\ngreat distance, proceeding from Rome as far as Ravenna, Milan, or\r\nAquileia.\r\n\r\nXXI.  He conquered, however, partly in person, and partly by his\r\nlieutenants, Cantabria [136], Aquitania and Pannonia [137], Dalmatia,\r\nwith all Illyricum and Rhaetia [138], besides the two Alpine nations, the\r\nVindelici and the Salassii [139].  He also checked the incursions of the\r\nDacians, by cutting off three of their generals with vast armies, and\r\ndrove the Germans beyond the river Elbe; removing two other tribes who\r\nsubmitted, the Ubii and Sicambri, into Gaul, and settling them in the\r\ncountry bordering on the Rhine.  Other nations also, which broke into\r\nrevolt, he reduced to submission.  But he never made war upon any nation\r\nwithout just and necessary cause; and was so far from being ambitious\r\neither to extend the empire, or advance his own military glory, that he\r\nobliged the chiefs of some barbarous tribes to swear in the temple of\r\nMars the Avenger [140], that they would faithfully observe their\r\nengagements, and not violate the peace which they had implored.  Of some\r\nhe demanded a new description of hostages, their women, having found from\r\nexperience that they cared little for their men when given as hostages;\r\nbut he always afforded them the means of getting back their hostages\r\nwhenever they wished it.  Even those who engaged most frequently and with\r\nthe greatest perfidy in their rebellion, he never punished more severely\r\nthan by selling their captives, on the terms (85) of their not serving in\r\nany neighbouring country, nor being released from their slavery before\r\nthe expiration of thirty years.  By the character which he thus acquired,\r\nfor virtue and moderation, he induced even the Indians and Scythians,\r\nnations before known to the Romans by report only, to solicit his\r\nfriendship, and that of the Roman people, by ambassadors.  The Parthians\r\nreadily allowed his claim to Armenia; restoring at his demand, the\r\nstandards which they had taken from Marcus Crassus and Mark Antony, and\r\noffering him hostages besides.  Afterwards, when a contest arose between\r\nseveral pretenders to the crown of that kingdom, they refused to\r\nacknowledge any one who was not chosen by him.\r\n\r\nXXII.  The temple of Janus Quirinus, which had been shut twice only, from\r\nthe era of the building of the city to his own time, he closed thrice in\r\na much shorter period, having established universal peace both by sea and\r\nland.  He twice entered the city with the honours of an Ovation [141],\r\nnamely, after the war of Philippi, and again after that of Sicily.  He\r\nhad also three curule triumphs [142] for his several victories in (86)\r\nDalmatia, at Actium, and Alexandria; each of which lasted three days.\r\n\r\nXXIII.  In all his wars, he never received any signal or ignominious\r\ndefeat, except twice in Germany, under his lieutenants Lollius and Varus.\r\nThe former indeed had in it more of dishonour than disaster; but that of\r\nVarus threatened the security of the empire itself; three legions, with\r\nthe commander, his lieutenants, and all the auxiliaries, being cut off.\r\nUpon receiving intelligence of this disaster, he gave orders for keeping\r\na strict watch over the city, to prevent any public disturbance, and\r\nprolonged the appointments of the prefects in the provinces, that the\r\nallies might be kept in order by experience of persons to whom they were\r\nused.  He made a vow to celebrate the great games in honour of Jupiter,\r\nOptimus, Maximus, “if he would be pleased to restore the state to more\r\nprosperous circumstances.”  This had formerly been resorted to in the\r\nCimbrian and Marsian wars.  In short, we are informed that he was in such\r\nconsternation at this event, that he let the hair of his head and beard\r\ngrow for several months, and sometimes knocked his head against the\r\ndoor-posts, crying out, “O, Quintilius Varus!  Give me back my legions!”\r\n And (87) ever after, he observed the anniversary of this calamity, as a\r\nday of sorrow and mourning.\r\n\r\nXXIV.  In military affairs he made many alterations, introducing some\r\npractices entirely new, and reviving others, which had become obsolete.\r\nHe maintained the strictest discipline among the troops; and would not\r\nallow even his lieutenants the liberty to visit their wives, except\r\nreluctantly, and in the winter season only.  A Roman knight having cut\r\noff the thumbs of his two young sons, to render them incapable of serving\r\nin the wars, he exposed both him and his estate to public sale.  But upon\r\nobserving the farmers of the revenue very greedy for the purchase, he\r\nassigned him to a freedman of his own, that he might send him into the\r\ncountry, and suffer him to retain his freedom.  The tenth legion becoming\r\nmutinous, he disbanded it with ignominy; and did the same by some others\r\nwhich petulantly demanded their discharge; withholding from them the\r\nrewards usually bestowed on those who had served their stated time in the\r\nwars.  The cohorts which yielded their ground in time of action, he\r\ndecimated, and fed with barley.  Centurions, as well as common sentinels,\r\nwho deserted their posts when on guard, he punished with death.  For\r\nother misdemeanors he inflicted upon them various kinds of disgrace; such\r\nas obliging them to stand all day before the praetorium, sometimes in\r\ntheir tunics only, and without their belts, sometimes to carry poles ten\r\nfeet long, or sods of turf.\r\n\r\nXXV.  After the conclusion of the civil wars, he never, in any of his\r\nmilitary harangues, or proclamations, addressed them by the title of\r\n“Fellow-soldiers,” but as “Soldiers” only.  Nor would he suffer them to\r\nbe otherwise called by his sons or step-sons, when they were in command;\r\njudging the former epithet to convey the idea of a degree of\r\ncondescension inconsistent with military discipline, the maintenance of\r\norder, and his own majesty, and that of his house.  Unless at Rome, in\r\ncase of incendiary fires, or under the apprehension of public\r\ndisturbances during a scarcity of provisions, he never employed in his\r\narmy slaves who had been made freedmen, except upon two occasions; on\r\none, for the security of the colonies bordering upon Illyricum, and on\r\nthe other, to guard (88) the banks of the river Rhine.  Although he\r\nobliged persons of fortune, both male and female, to give up their\r\nslaves, and they received their manumission at once, yet he kept them\r\ntogether under their own standard, unmixed with soldiers who were better\r\nborn, and armed likewise after different fashion.  Military rewards, such\r\nas trappings, collars, and other decorations of gold and silver, he\r\ndistributed more readily than camp or mural crowns, which were reckoned\r\nmore honourable than the former.  These he bestowed sparingly, without\r\npartiality, and frequently even on common soldiers.  He presented M.\r\nAgrippa, after the naval engagement in the Sicilian war, with a sea-green\r\nbanner.  Those who shared in the honours of a triumph, although they had\r\nattended him in his expeditions, and taken part in his victories, he\r\njudged it improper to distinguish by the usual rewards for service,\r\nbecause they had a right themselves to grant such rewards to whom they\r\npleased.  He thought nothing more derogatory to the character of an\r\naccomplished general than precipitancy and rashness; on which account he\r\nhad frequently in his mouth those proverbs:\r\n\r\n    Speude bradeos,\r\n    Hasten slowly,\r\n\r\nAnd\r\n\r\n    ‘Asphalaes gar est’ ameinon, hae erasus strataelataes.\r\n    The cautious captain’s better than the bold.\r\n\r\nAnd “That is done fast enough, which is done well enough.”\r\n\r\nHe was wont to say also, that “a battle or a war ought never to be\r\nundertaken, unless the prospect of gain overbalanced the fear of loss.\r\nFor,” said he, “men who pursue small advantages with no small hazard,\r\nresemble those who fish with a golden hook, the loss of which, if the\r\nline should happen to break, could never be compensated by all the fish\r\nthey might take.”\r\n\r\nXXVI.  He was advanced to public offices before the age at which he was\r\nlegally qualified for them; and to some, also, of a new kind, and for\r\nlife.  He seized the consulship in the twentieth year of his age,\r\nquartering his legions in a threatening manner near the city, and sending\r\ndeputies to demand it for him in the name of the army.  When the senate\r\ndemurred, (89) a centurion, named Cornelius, who was at the head of the\r\nchief deputation, throwing back his cloak, and shewing the hilt of his\r\nsword, had the presumption to say in the senate-house, “This will make\r\nhim consul, if ye will not.”  His second consulship he filled nine years\r\nafterwards; his third, after the interval of only one year, and held the\r\nsame office every year successively until the eleventh.  From this\r\nperiod, although the consulship was frequently offered him, he always\r\ndeclined it, until, after a long interval, not less than seventeen years,\r\nhe voluntarily stood for the twelfth, and two years after that, for a\r\nthirteenth; that he might successively introduce into the forum, on their\r\nentering public life, his two sons, Caius and Lucius, while he was\r\ninvested with the highest office in the state.  In his five consulships\r\nfrom the sixth to the eleventh, he continued in office throughout the\r\nyear; but in the rest, during only nine, six, four, or three months, and\r\nin his second no more than a few hours.  For having sat for a short time\r\nin the morning, upon the calends of January [1st January], in his curule\r\nchair [143], before the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, he abdicated the\r\noffice, and substituted another in his room.  Nor did he enter upon them\r\nall at Rome, but upon the fourth in Asia, the fifth in the Isle of Samos,\r\nand the eighth and ninth at Tarragona. [144]\r\n\r\nXXVII.  During ten years he acted as one of the triumvirate for settling\r\nthe commonwealth, in which office he for some time opposed his colleagues\r\nin their design of a proscription; but after it was begun, he prosecuted\r\nit with more determined rigour than either of them.  For whilst they were\r\noften prevailed upon, by the interest and intercession of friends, to\r\nshew mercy, he alone strongly insisted that no one should be spared, and\r\neven proscribed Caius Toranius [145], his guardian; who had (90) been\r\nformerly the colleague of his father Octavius in the aedileship.  Junius\r\nSaturnius adds this farther account of him: that when, after the\r\nproscription was over, Marcus Lepidus made an apology in the senate for\r\ntheir past proceedings, and gave them hopes of a more mild administration\r\nfor the future, because they had now sufficiently crushed their enemies;\r\nhe, on the other hand, declared that the only limit he had fixed to the\r\nproscription was, that he should be free to act as he pleased.\r\nAfterwards, however, repenting of his severity, he advanced T. Vinius\r\nPhilopoemen to the equestrian rank, for having concealed his patron at\r\nthe time he was proscribed.  In this same office he incurred great odium\r\nupon many accounts.  For as he was one day making an harangue, observing\r\namong the soldiers Pinarius, a Roman knight, admit some private citizens,\r\nand engaged in taking notes, he ordered him to be stabbed before his\r\neyes, as a busy-body and a spy upon him.  He so terrified with his\r\nmenaces Tedius Afer, the consul elect [146], for having reflected upon\r\nsome action of his, that he threw himself from a great height, and died\r\non the spot.  And when Quintus Gallius, the praetor, came to compliment\r\nhim with a double tablet under his cloak, suspecting that it was a sword\r\nhe had concealed, and yet not venturing to make a search, lest it should\r\nbe found to be something else, he caused him to be dragged from his\r\ntribunal by centurions and soldiers, and tortured like a slave: and\r\nalthough he made no confession, ordered him to be put to death, after he\r\nhad, with his own hands, plucked out his eyes.  His own account of the\r\nmatter, however, is, that Quintus Gallius sought a private conference\r\nwith him, for the purpose of assassinating him; that he therefore put him\r\nin prison, but afterwards released him, and banished him the city; when\r\nhe perished either in a storm at sea, or by falling into the hands of\r\nrobbers.\r\n\r\nHe accepted of the tribunitian power for life, but more than once chose a\r\ncolleague in that office for two lustra [147] successively.  He also had\r\nthe supervision of morality and observance of the laws, for life, but\r\nwithout the title of censor; yet he thrice (91) took a census of the\r\npeople, the first and third time with a colleague, but the second by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.  He twice entertained thoughts of restoring the republic [148];\r\nfirst, immediately after he had crushed Antony, remembering that he had\r\noften charged him with being the obstacle to its restoration.  The second\r\ntime was in consequence of a long illness, when he sent for the\r\nmagistrates and the senate to his own house, and delivered them a\r\nparticular account of the state of the empire.  But reflecting at the\r\nsame time that it would be both hazardous to himself to return to the\r\ncondition of a private person, and might be dangerous to the public to\r\nhave the government placed again under the control of the people, he\r\nresolved to keep it in his own hands, whether with the better event or\r\nintention, is hard to say.  His good intentions he often affirmed in\r\nprivate discourse, and also published an edict, in which it was declared\r\nin the following terms: “May it be permitted me to have the happiness of\r\nestablishing the commonwealth on a safe and sound basis, and thus enjoy\r\nthe reward of which I am ambitious, that of being celebrated for moulding\r\nit into the form best adapted to present circumstances; so that, on my\r\nleaving the world, I may carry with me the hope that the foundations\r\nwhich I have laid for its future government, will stand firm and stable.”\r\n\r\nXXIX.  The city, which was not built in a manner suitable to the grandeur\r\nof the empire, and was liable to inundations of the Tiber [149], as well\r\nas to fires, was so much improved under his administration, that he\r\nboasted, not without reason, that he “found it of brick, but left it of\r\nmarble.” [150]  He also rendered (92) it secure for the time to come\r\nagainst such disasters, as far as could be effected by human foresight.\r\nA great number of public buildings were erected by him, the most\r\nconsiderable of which were a forum [151], containing the temple of Mars\r\nthe Avenger, the temple of Apollo on the Palatine hill, and the temple of\r\nJupiter Tonans in the Capitol.  The reason of his building a new forum\r\nwas the vast increase in the population, and the number of causes to be\r\ntried in the courts, for which, the two already existing not affording\r\nsufficient space, it was thought necessary to have a third.  It was\r\ntherefore opened for public use before the temple of Mars was completely\r\nfinished; and a law was passed, that causes should be tried, and judges\r\nchosen by lot, in that place.  The temple of Mars was built in fulfilment\r\nof a vow made during the war of Philippi, undertaken by him to avenge his\r\nfather’s murder.  He ordained that the senate should always assemble\r\nthere when they met to deliberate respecting wars and triumphs; that\r\nthence should be despatched all those who were sent into the provinces in\r\nthe command of armies; and that in it those who returned victorious from\r\nthe wars, should lodge the trophies of their triumphs.  He erected the\r\ntemple of Apollo [152] in that part of his house on the Palatine hill\r\nwhich had been struck with lightning, and which, on that account, the\r\nsoothsayers declared the God to have chosen.  He added porticos to it,\r\nwith a library of Latin and Greek authors [153]; and when advanced in\r\nyears, (93) used frequently there to hold the senate, and examine the\r\nrolls of the judges.\r\n\r\nHe dedicated the temple to Apollo Tonans [154], in acknowledgment of his\r\nescape from a great danger in his Cantabrian expedition; when, as he was\r\ntravelling in the night, his litter was struck by lightning, which killed\r\nthe slave who carried a torch before him.  He likewise constructed some\r\npublic buildings in the name of others; for instance, his grandsons, his\r\nwife, and sister.  Thus he built the portico and basilica of Lucius and\r\nCaius, and the porticos of Livia and Octavia [155], and the theatre of\r\nMarcellus [156].  He also often exhorted other persons of rank to\r\nembellish the city by new buildings, or repairing and improving the old,\r\naccording to their means.  In consequence of this recommendation, many\r\nwere raised; such as the temple of Hercules and the Muses, by Marcius\r\nPhilippus; a temple of Diana by Lucius Cornificius; the Court of Freedom\r\nby Asinius Pollio; a temple of Saturn by Munatius Plancus; a theatre by\r\nCornelius Balbus [157]; an amphitheatre by Statilius Taurus; and several\r\nother noble edifices by Marcus Agrippa. [158]\r\n\r\n(94) XXX.  He divided the city into regions and districts, ordaining that\r\nthe annual magistrates should take by lot the charge of the former; and\r\nthat the latter should be superintended by wardens chosen out of the\r\npeople of each neighbourhood.  He appointed a nightly watch to be on\r\ntheir guard against accidents from fire; and, to prevent the frequent\r\ninundations, he widened and cleansed the bed of the Tiber, which had in\r\nthe course of years been almost dammed up with rubbish, and the channel\r\nnarrowed by the ruins of houses [159].  To render the approaches to the\r\ncity more commodious, he took upon himself the charge of repairing the\r\nFlaminian way as far as Ariminum [160], and distributed the repairs of\r\nthe other roads amongst several persons who had obtained the honour of a\r\ntriumph; to be defrayed out of the money arising from the spoils of war.\r\nTemples decayed by time, or destroyed by fire, he either repaired or\r\nrebuilt; and enriched them, as well as many others, with splendid\r\nofferings.  On a single occasion, he deposited in the cell of the temple\r\nof Jupiter Capitolinus, sixteen thousand pounds of gold, with jewels and\r\npearls to the amount of fifty millions of sesterces.\r\n\r\nXXXI.  The office of Pontifex Maximus, of which he could (95) not\r\ndecently deprive Lepidus as long as he lived [161], he assumed as soon as\r\nhe was dead.  He then caused all prophetical books, both in Latin and\r\nGreek, the authors of which were either unknown, or of no great\r\nauthority, to be brought in; and the whole collection, amounting to\r\nupwards of two thousand volumes, he committed to the flames, preserving\r\nonly the Sibylline oracles; but not even those without a strict\r\nexamination, to ascertain which were genuine.  This being done, he\r\ndeposited them in two gilt coffers, under the pedestal of the statue of\r\nthe Palatine Apollo.  He restored the calendar, which had been corrected\r\nby Julius Caesar, but through negligence was again fallen into confusion\r\n[162], to its former regularity; and upon that occasion, called the month\r\nSextilis [163], by his own name, August, rather than September, in which\r\nhe was born; because in it he had obtained his first consulship, and all\r\nhis most considerable victories [164].  He increased the number, dignity,\r\nand revenues of the priests, and especially those of the Vestal Virgins.\r\nAnd when, upon the death of one of them, a new one was to be taken [165],\r\nand many persons made interest that their daughters’ names might be\r\nomitted in the lists for election, he replied with an oath, “If either of\r\nmy own grand-daughters were old enough, I would have proposed her.”\r\n\r\nHe likewise revived some old religious customs, which had become\r\nobsolete; as the augury of public health [166], the office of (96) high\r\npriest of Jupiter, the religious solemnity of the Lupercalia, with the\r\nSecular, and Compitalian games.  He prohibited young boys from running in\r\nthe Lupercalia; and in respect of the Secular games, issued an order,\r\nthat no young persons of either sex should appear at any public\r\ndiversions in the night-time, unless in the company of some elderly\r\nrelation.  He ordered the household gods to be decked twice a year with\r\nspring and summer flowers [167], in the Compitalian festival.\r\n\r\nNext to the immortal gods, he paid the highest honours to the memory of\r\nthose generals who had raised the Roman state from its low origin to the\r\nhighest pitch of grandeur.  He accordingly repaired or rebuilt the public\r\nedifices erected by them; preserving the former inscriptions, and placing\r\nstatues of them all, with triumphal emblems, in both the porticos of his\r\nforum, issuing an edict on the occasion, in which he made the following\r\ndeclaration: “My design in so doing is, that the Roman people may require\r\nfrom me, and all succeeding princes, a conformity to those illustrious\r\nexamples.”  He likewise removed the statue of Pompey from the\r\nsenate-house, in which Caius Caesar had been killed, and placed it under\r\na marble arch, fronting the palace attached to Pompey’s theatre.\r\n\r\nXXXII.  He corrected many ill practices, which, to the detriment of the\r\npublic, had either survived the licentious habits of the late civil wars,\r\nor else originated in the long peace.  Bands of robbers showed themselves\r\nopenly, completely armed, under colour of self-defence; and in different\r\nparts of the country, travellers, freemen and slaves without distinction,\r\nwere forcibly carried off, and kept to work in the houses of correction\r\n[168].  Several associations were formed under the specious (97) name of\r\na new college, which banded together for the perpetration of all kinds of\r\nvillany.  The banditti he quelled by establishing posts of soldiers in\r\nsuitable stations for the purpose; the houses of correction were\r\nsubjected to a strict superintendence; all associations, those only\r\nexcepted which were of ancient standing, and recognised by the laws, were\r\ndissolved.  He burnt all the notes of those who had been a long time in\r\narrear with the treasury, as being the principal source of vexatious\r\nsuits and prosecutions.  Places in the city claimed by the public, where\r\nthe right was doubtful, he adjudged to the actual possessors.  He struck\r\nout of the list of criminals the names of those over whom prosecutions\r\nhad been long impending, where nothing further was intended by the\r\ninformers than to gratify their own malice, by seeing their enemies\r\nhumiliated; laying it down as a rule, that if any one chose to renew a\r\nprosecution, he should incur the risk of the punishment which he sought\r\nto inflict.  And that crimes might not escape punishment, nor business be\r\nneglected by delay, he ordered the courts to sit during the thirty days\r\nwhich were spent in celebrating honorary games.  To the three classes of\r\njudges then existing, he added a fourth, consisting of persons of\r\ninferior order, who were called Ducenarii, and decided all litigations\r\nabout trifling sums.  He chose judges from the age of thirty years and\r\nupwards; that is five years younger than had been usual before.  And a\r\ngreat many declining the office, he was with much difficulty prevailed\r\nupon to allow each class of judges a twelve-month’s vacation in turn; and\r\nthe courts to be shut during the months of November and December. [169]\r\n\r\nXXXIII.  He was himself assiduous in his functions as a judge, and would\r\nsometimes prolong his sittings even into the night [170]: if he were\r\nindisposed, his litter was placed before (98) the tribunal, or he\r\nadministered justice reclining on his couch at home; displaying always\r\nnot only the greatest attention, but extreme lenity.  To save a culprit,\r\nwho evidently appeared guilty of parricide, from the extreme penalty of\r\nbeing sewn up in a sack, because none were punished in that manner but\r\nsuch as confessed the fact, he is said to have interrogated him thus:\r\n“Surely you did not kill your father, did you?”  And when, in a trial of\r\na cause about a forged will, all those who had signed it were liable to\r\nthe penalty of the Cornelian law, he ordered that his colleagues on the\r\ntribunal should not only be furnished with the two tablets by which they\r\ndecided, “guilty or not guilty,” but with a third likewise, ignoring the\r\noffence of those who should appear to have given their signatures through\r\nany deception or mistake.  All appeals in causes between inhabitants of\r\nRome, he assigned every year to the praetor of the city; and where\r\nprovincials were concerned, to men of consular rank, to one of whom the\r\nbusiness of each province was referred.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.  Some laws he abrogated, and he made some new ones; such as the\r\nsumptuary law, that relating to adultery and the violation of chastity,\r\nthe law against bribery in elections, and likewise that for the\r\nencouragement of marriage.  Having been more severe in his reform of this\r\nlaw than the rest, he found the people utterly averse to submit to it,\r\nunless the penalties were abolished or mitigated, besides allowing an\r\ninterval of three years after a wife’s death, and increasing the premiums\r\non marriage.  The equestrian order clamoured loudly, at a spectacle in\r\nthe theatre, for its total repeal; whereupon he sent for the children of\r\nGermanicus, and shewed them partly sitting upon his own lap, and partly\r\non their father’s; intimating by his looks and gestures, that they ought\r\nnot to think it a grievance to follow the example of that young man.  But\r\nfinding that the force of the law was eluded, by marrying girls under the\r\nage of puberty, and by frequent change of wives, he limited the time for\r\nconsummation after espousals, and imposed restrictions on divorce.\r\n\r\nXXXV.  By two separate scrutinies he reduced to their former number and\r\nsplendour the senate, which had been swamped by a disorderly crowd; for\r\nthey were now more than a (99) thousand, and some of them very mean\r\npersons, who, after Caesar’s death, had been chosen by dint of interest\r\nand bribery, so that they had the nickname of Orcini among the people\r\n[171].  The first of these scrutinies was left to themselves, each\r\nsenator naming another; but the last was conducted by himself and\r\nAgrippa.  On this occasion he is believed to have taken his seat as he\r\npresided, with a coat of mail under his tunic, and a sword by his side,\r\nand with ten of the stoutest men of senatorial rank, who were his\r\nfriends, standing round his chair.  Cordus Cremutius [172] relates that\r\nno senator was suffered to approach him, except singly, and after having\r\nhis bosom searched [for secreted daggers].  Some he obliged to have the\r\ngrace of declining the office; these he allowed to retain the privileges\r\nof wearing the distinguishing dress, occupying the seats at the solemn\r\nspectacles, and of feasting publicly, reserved to the senatorial order\r\n[173].  That those who were chosen and approved of, might perform their\r\nfunctions under more solemn obligations, and with less inconvenience, he\r\nordered that every senator, before he took his seat in the house, should\r\npay his devotions, with an offering of frankincense and wine, at the\r\naltar of that God in whose temple the senate then assembled [174], and\r\nthat their stated meetings should be only twice in the month, namely, on\r\nthe calends and ides; and that in the months of September and October\r\n[175], a certain number only, chosen by lot, such as the law required to\r\ngive validity to a decree, should be required to attend.  For himself, he\r\nresolved to choose every six (100) months a new council, with whom he\r\nmight consult previously upon such affairs as he judged proper at any\r\ntime to lay before the full senate.  He also took the votes of the\r\nsenators upon any subject of importance, not according to custom, nor in\r\nregular order, but as he pleased; that every one might hold himself ready\r\nto give his opinion, rather than a mere vote of assent.\r\n\r\nXXXVI.  He also made several other alterations in the management of\r\npublic affairs, among which were these following: that the acts of the\r\nsenate should not be published [176]; that the magistrates should not be\r\nsent into the provinces immediately after the expiration of their office;\r\nthat the proconsuls should have a certain sum assigned them out of the\r\ntreasury for mules and tents, which used before to be contracted for by\r\nthe government with private persons; that the management of the treasury\r\nshould be transferred from the city-quaestors to the praetors, or those\r\nwho had already served in the latter office; and that the decemviri\r\nshould call together the court of One hundred, which had been formerly\r\nsummoned by those who had filled the office of quaestor.\r\n\r\nXXXVII.  To augment the number of persons employed in the administration\r\nof the state, he devised several new offices; such as surveyors of the\r\npublic buildings, of the roads, the aqueducts, and the bed of the Tiber;\r\nfor the distribution of corn to the people; the praefecture of the city;\r\na triumvirate for the election of the senators; and another for\r\ninspecting the several troops of the equestrian order, as often as it was\r\nnecessary.  He revived the office of censor [177], which had been long\r\ndisused, and increased the number of praetors.  He likewise required that\r\nwhenever the consulship was conferred on him, he should have two\r\ncolleagues instead of one; but his proposal (101) was rejected, all the\r\nsenators declaring by acclamation that he abated his high majesty quite\r\nenough in not filling the office alone, and consenting to share it with\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.  He was unsparing in the reward of military merit, having\r\ngranted to above thirty generals the honour of the greater triumph;\r\nbesides which, he took care to have triamphal decorations voted by the\r\nsenate for more than that number.  That the sons of senators might become\r\nearly acquainted with the administration of affairs, he permitted them,\r\nat the age when they took the garb of manhood [178], to assume also the\r\ndistinction of the senatorian robe, with its broad border, and to be\r\npresent at the debates in the senate-house.  When they entered the\r\nmilitary service, he not only gave them the rank of military tribunes in\r\nthe legions, but likewise the command of the auxiliary horse.  And that\r\nall might have an opportunity of acquiring military experience, he\r\ncommonly joined two sons of senators in command of each troop of horse.\r\nHe frequently reviewed the troops of the equestrian order, reviving the\r\nancient custom of a cavalcade [179], which had been long laid aside.  But\r\nhe did not suffer any one to be obliged by an accuser to dismount while\r\nhe passed in review, as had formerly been the practice.  As for such as\r\nwere infirm with age, or (102) any way deformed, he allowed them to send\r\ntheir horses before them, coming on foot to answer to their names, when\r\nthe muster roll was called over soon afterwards.  He permitted those who\r\nhad attained the age of thirty-five years, and desired not to keep their\r\nhorse any longer, to have the privilege of giving it up.\r\n\r\nXXXIX.  With the assistance of ten senators, he obliged each of the Roman\r\nknights to give an account of his life: in regard to those who fell under\r\nhis displeasure, some were punished; others had a mark of infamy set\r\nagainst their names.  The most part he only reprimanded, but not in the\r\nsame terms.  The mildest mode of reproof was by delivering them tablets\r\n[180], the contents of which, confined to themselves, they were to read\r\non the spot.  Some he disgraced for borrowing money at low interest, and\r\nletting it out again upon usurious profit.\r\n\r\nXL.  In the election of tribunes of the people, if there was not a\r\nsufficient number of senatorian candidates, he nominated others from the\r\nequestrian order; granting them the liberty, after the expiration of\r\ntheir office, to continue in whichsoever of the two orders they pleased.\r\nAs most of the knights had been much reduced in their estates by the\r\ncivil wars, and therefore durst not sit to see the public games in the\r\ntheatre in the seats allotted to their order, for fear of the penalty\r\nprovided by the law in that case, he enacted, that none were liable to\r\nit, who had themselves, or whose parents had ever, possessed a knight’s\r\nestate.  He took the census of the Roman people street by street: and\r\nthat the people might not be too often taken from their business to\r\nreceive the distribution of corn, it was his intention to deliver tickets\r\nthree times a year for four months respectively; but at their request, he\r\ncontinued the former regulation, that they should receive their (103)\r\nshare monthly.  He revived the former law of elections, endeavouring, by\r\nvarious penalties, to suppress the practice of bribery.  Upon the day of\r\nelection, he distributed to the freemen of the Fabian and Scaptian\r\ntribes, in which he himself was enrolled, a thousand sesterces each, that\r\nthey might look for nothing from any of the candidates.  Considering it\r\nof extreme importance to preserve the Roman people pure, and untainted\r\nwith a mixture of foreign or servile blood, he not only bestowed the\r\nfreedom of the city with a sparing hand, but laid some restriction upon\r\nthe practice of manumitting slaves.  When Tiberius interceded with him\r\nfor the freedom of Rome in behalf of a Greek client of his, he wrote to\r\nhim for answer, “I shall not grant it, unless he comes himself, and\r\nsatisfies me that he has just grounds for the application.”  And when\r\nLivia begged the freedom of the city for a tributary Gaul, he refused it,\r\nbut offered to release him from payment of taxes, saying, “I shall sooner\r\nsuffer some loss in my exchequer, than that the citizenship of Rome be\r\nrendered too common.”  Not content with interposing many obstacles to\r\neither the partial or complete emancipation of slaves, by quibbles\r\nrespecting the number, condition and difference of those who were to be\r\nmanumitted; he likewise enacted that none who had been put in chains or\r\ntortured, should ever obtain the freedom of the city in any degree.  He\r\nendeavoured also to restore the old habit and dress of the Romans; and\r\nupon seeing once, in an assembly of the people, a crowd in grey cloaks\r\n[181], he exclaimed with indignation, “See there,\r\n\r\n    Romanos rerum dominos, gentemque togatem.” [182]\r\n\r\n    Rome’s conquering sons, lords of the wide-spread globe,\r\n    Stalk proudly in the toga’s graceful robe.\r\n\r\nAnd he gave orders to the ediles not to permit, in future, any Roman to\r\nbe present in the forum or circus unless they took off their short coats,\r\nand wore the toga.\r\n\r\n(104) XLI.  He displayed his munificence to all ranks of the people on\r\nvarious occasions.  Moreover, upon his bringing the treasure belonging to\r\nthe kings of Egypt into the city, in his Alexandrian triumph, he made\r\nmoney so plentiful, that interest fell, and the price of land rose\r\nconsiderably.  And afterwards, as often as large sums of money came into\r\nhis possession by means of confiscations, he would lend it free of\r\ninterest, for a fixed term, to such as could give security for the double\r\nof what was borrowed.  The estate necessary to qualify a senator, instead\r\nof eight hundred thousand sesterces, the former standard, he ordered, for\r\nthe future, to be twelve hundred thousand; and to those who had not so\r\nmuch, he made good the deficiency.  He often made donations to the\r\npeople, but generally of different sums; sometimes four hundred,\r\nsometimes three hundred, or two hundred and fifty sesterces upon which\r\noccasions, he extended his bounty even to young boys, who before were not\r\nused to receive anything, until they arrived at eleven years of age.  In\r\na scarcity of corn, he would frequently let them have it at a very low\r\nprice, or none at all; and doubled the number of the money tickets.\r\n\r\nXLII.  But to show that he was a prince who regarded more the good of his\r\npeople than their applause, he reprimanded them very severely, upon their\r\ncomplaining of the scarcity and dearness of wine.  “My son-in-law,\r\nAgrippa,” he said, “has sufficiently provided for quenching your thirst,\r\nby the great plenty of water with which he has supplied the town.”  Upon\r\ntheir demanding a gift which he had promised them, he said, “I am a man\r\nof my word.”  But upon their importuning him for one which he had not\r\npromised, he issued a proclamation upbraiding them for their scandalous\r\nimpudence; at the same time telling them, “I shall now give you nothing,\r\nwhatever I may have intended to do.”  With the same strict firmness,\r\nwhen, upon a promise he had made of a donative, he found many slaves had\r\nbeen emancipated and enrolled amongst the citizens, he declared that no\r\none should receive anything who was not included in the promise, and he\r\ngave the rest less than he had promised them, in order that the amount he\r\nhad set apart might hold out.  On one occasion, in a season of great\r\nscarcity, which it was difficult to remedy, he ordered out of the city\r\nthe troops of slaves brought for sale, the gladiators (105) belonging to\r\nthe masters of defence, and all foreigners, excepting physicians and the\r\nteachers of the liberal sciences.  Part of the domestic slaves were\r\nlikewise ordered to be dismissed.  When, at last, plenty was restored, he\r\nwrites thus “I was much inclined to abolish for ever the practice of\r\nallowing the people corn at the public expense, because they trust so\r\nmuch to it, that they are too lazy to till their lands; but I did not\r\npersevere in my design, as I felt sure that the practice would some time\r\nor other be revived by some one ambitious of popular favour.”  However,\r\nhe so managed the affair ever afterwards, that as much account was taken\r\nof husbandmen and traders, as of the idle populace. [183]\r\n\r\nXLIII.  In the number, variety, and magnificence of his public\r\nspectacles, he surpassed all former example.  Four-and-twenty times, he\r\nsays, he treated the people with games upon his own account, and\r\nthree-and-twenty times for such magistrates as were either absent, or not\r\nable to afford the expense.  The performances took place sometimes in the\r\ndifferent streets of the city, and upon several stages, by players in all\r\nlanguages.  The same he did not only in the forum and amphitheatre, but\r\nin the circus likewise, and in the septa [184]: and sometimes he\r\nexhibited only the hunting of wild beasts.  He entertained the people\r\nwith wrestlers in the Campus Martius, where wooden seats were erected for\r\nthe purpose; and also with a naval fight, for which he excavated the\r\nground near the Tiber, where there is now the grove of the Caesars.\r\nDuring these two entertainments he stationed guards in the city, lest, by\r\nrobbers taking advantage of the small number of people left at home, it\r\nmight be exposed to depredations.  In the circus he exhibited chariot and\r\nfoot races, and combats with wild beasts, in which the performers were\r\noften youths of the highest rank.  His favourite spectacle was the Trojan\r\ngame, acted by a select number of boys, in parties differing in age and\r\nstation; thinking (106) that it was a practice both excellent in itself,\r\nand sanctioned by ancient usage, that the spirit of the young nobles\r\nshould be displayed in such exercises.  Caius Nonius Asprenas, who was\r\nlamed by a fall in this diversion, he presented with a gold collar, and\r\nallowed him and his posterity to bear the surname of Torquati.  But soon\r\nafterwards he gave up the exhibition of this game, in consequence of a\r\nsevere and bitter speech made in the senate by Asinius Pollio, the\r\norator, in which he complained bitterly of the misfortune of Aeserninus,\r\nhis grandson, who likewise broke his leg in the same diversion.\r\n\r\nSometimes he engaged Roman knights to act upon the stage, or to fight as\r\ngladiators; but only before the practice was prohibited by a decree of\r\nthe senate.  Thenceforth, the only exhibition he made of that kind, was\r\nthat of a young man named Lucius, of a good family, who was not quite two\r\nfeet in height, and weighed only seventeen pounds, but had a stentorian\r\nvoice.  In one of his public spectacles, he brought the hostages of the\r\nParthians, the first ever sent to Rome from that nation, through the\r\nmiddle of the amphitheatre, and placed them in the second tier of seats\r\nabove him.  He used likewise, at times when there were no public\r\nentertainments, if any thing was brought to Rome which was uncommon, and\r\nmight gratify curiosity, to expose it to public view, in any place\r\nwhatever; as he did a rhinoceros in the Septa, a tiger upon a stage, and\r\na snake fifty cubits lung in the Comitium.  It happened in the Circensian\r\ngames, which he performed in consequence of a vow, that he was taken ill,\r\nand obliged to attend the Thensae [185], reclining on a litter.  Another\r\ntime, in the games celebrated for the opening of the theatre of\r\nMarcellus, the joints of his curule chair happening to give way, he fell\r\non his back.  And in the games exhibited by his (107) grandsons, when the\r\npeople were in such consternation, by an alarm raised that the theatre\r\nwas falling, that all his efforts to re-assure them and keep them quiet,\r\nfailed, he moved from his place, and seated himself in that part of the\r\ntheatre which was thought to be exposed to most danger.\r\n\r\nXLIV.  He corrected the confusion and disorder with which the spectators\r\ntook their seats at the public games, after an affront which was offered\r\nto a senator at Puteoli, for whom, in a crowded theatre, no one would\r\nmake room.  He therefore procured a decree of the senate, that in all\r\npublic spectacles of any sort, and in any place whatever, the first tier\r\nof benches should be left empty for the accommodation of senators.  He\r\nwould not even permit the ambassadors of free nations, nor of those which\r\nwere allies of Rome, to sit in the orchestra; having found that some\r\nmanumitted slaves had been sent under that character.  He separated the\r\nsoldiery from the rest of the people, and assigned to married plebeians\r\ntheir particular rows of seats.  To the boys he assigned their own\r\nbenches, and to their tutors the seats which were nearest it; ordering\r\nthat none clothed in black should sit in the centre of the circle [186].\r\nNor would he allow any women to witness the combats of gladiators, except\r\nfrom the upper part of the theatre, although they formerly used to take\r\ntheir places promiscuously with the rest of the spectators.  To the\r\nvestal virgins he granted seats in the theatre, reserved for them only,\r\nopposite the praetor’s bench.  He excluded, however, the whole female sex\r\nfrom seeing the wrestlers: so that in the games which he exhibited upon\r\nhis accession to the office of high-priest, he deferred producing a pair\r\nof combatants which the people called for, until the next morning; and\r\nintimated by proclamation, “his pleasure that no woman should appear in\r\nthe theatre before five o’clock.”\r\n\r\nXLV.  He generally viewed the Circensian games himself, from the upper\r\nrooms of the houses of his friends or freedmen; sometimes from the place\r\nappointed for the statues of the gods, and sitting in company with his\r\nwife and children.  He (108) occasionally absented himself from the\r\nspectacles for several hours, and sometimes for whole days; but not\r\nwithout first making an apology, and appointing substitutes to preside in\r\nhis stead.  When present, he never attended to anything else either to\r\navoid the reflections which he used to say were commonly made upon his\r\nfather, Caesar, for perusing letters and memorials, and making rescripts\r\nduring the spectacles; or from the real pleasure he took in attending\r\nthose exhibitions; of which he made no secret, he often candidly owning\r\nit.  This he manifested frequently by presenting honorary crowns and\r\nhandsome rewards to the best performers, in the games exhibited by\r\nothers; and he never was present at any performance of the Greeks,\r\nwithout rewarding the most deserving, according to their merit.  He took\r\nparticular pleasure in witnessing pugilistic contests, especially those\r\nof the Latins, not only between combatants who had been trained\r\nscientifically, whom he used often to match with the Greek champions; but\r\neven between mobs of the lower classes fighting in streets, and tilting\r\nat random, without any knowledge of the art.  In short, he honoured with\r\nhis patronage all sorts of people who contributed in any way to the\r\nsuccess of the public entertainments.  He not only maintained, but\r\nenlarged, the privileges of the wrestlers.  He prohibited combats of\r\ngladiators where no quarter was given.  He deprived the magistrates of\r\nthe power of correcting the stage-players, which by an ancient law was\r\nallowed them at all times, and in all places; restricting their\r\njurisdiction entirely to the time of performance and misdemeanours in the\r\ntheatres.  He would, however, admit, of no abatement, and exacted with\r\nthe utmost rigour the greatest exertions of the wrestlers and gladiators\r\nin their several encounters.  He went so far in restraining the\r\nlicentiousness of stage-players, that upon discovering that Stephanio, a\r\nperformer of the highest class, had a married woman with her hair\r\ncropped, and dressed in boy’s clothes, to wait upon him at table, he\r\nordered him to be whipped through all the three theatres, and then\r\nbanished him.  Hylas, an actor of pantomimes, upon a complaint against\r\nhim by the praetor, he commanded to be scourged in the court of his own\r\nhouse, which, however, was open to the public.  And Pylades he not only\r\nbanished from the city, but from Italy also, for pointing with his finger\r\nat a spectator by whom he was hissed, and turning the eyes of the\r\naudience upon him.\r\n\r\n(109) XLVI.  Having thus regulated the city and its concerns, he\r\naugmented the population of Italy by planting in it no less than\r\ntwenty-eight colonies [187], and greatly improved it by public works, and\r\na beneficial application of the revenues.  In rights and privileges, he\r\nrendered it in a measure equal to the city itself, by inventing a new kind\r\nof suffrage, which the principal officers and magistrates of the colonies\r\nmight take at home, and forward under seal to the city, against the time\r\nof the elections.  To increase the number of persons of condition, and of\r\nchildren among the lower ranks, he granted the petitions of all those who\r\nrequested the honour of doing military service on horseback as knights,\r\nprovided their demands were seconded by the recommendation of the town in\r\nwhich they lived; and when he visited the several districts of Italy, he\r\ndistributed a thousand sesterces a head to such of the lower class as\r\npresented him with sons or daughters.\r\n\r\nXLVII.  The more important provinces, which could not with ease or safety\r\nbe entrusted to the government of annual magistrates, he reserved for his\r\nown administration: the rest he distributed by lot amongst the\r\nproconsuls: but sometimes he made exchanges, and frequently visited most\r\nof both kinds in person.  Some cities in alliance with Rome, but which by\r\ntheir great licentiousness were hastening to ruin, he deprived of their\r\nindependence.  Others, which were much in debt, he relieved, and rebuilt\r\nsuch as had been destroyed by earthquakes.  To those that could produce\r\nany instance of their having deserved well of the Roman people, he\r\npresented the freedom of Latium, or even that of the City.  There is not,\r\nI believe, a province, except Africa and Sardinia, which he did not\r\nvisit.  After forcing Sextus Pompeius to take refuge in those provinces,\r\nhe was indeed preparing to cross over from Sicily to them, but was\r\nprevented by continual and violent storms, and afterwards there was no\r\noccasion or call for such a voyage.\r\n\r\nXLVIII.  Kingdoms, of which he had made himself master by the right of\r\nconquest, a few only excepted, he either restored to their former\r\npossessors [188], or conferred upon aliens.  Between (110) kings of\r\nalliance with Rome, he encouraged most intimate union; being always ready\r\nto promote or favour any proposal of marriage or friendship amongst them;\r\nand, indeed, treated them all with the same consideration, as if they\r\nwere members and parts of the empire.  To such of them as were minors or\r\nlunatics he appointed guardians, until they arrived at age, or recovered\r\ntheir senses; and the sons of many of them he brought up and educated\r\nwith his own.\r\n\r\nXLIX.  With respect to the army, he distributed the legions and auxiliary\r\ntroops throughout the several provinces, he stationed a fleet at Misenum,\r\nand another at Ravenna, for the protection of the Upper and Lower Seas\r\n[189].  A certain number of the forces were selected, to occupy the posts\r\nin the city, and partly for his own body-guard; but he dismissed the\r\nSpanish guard, which he retained about him till the fall of Antony; and\r\nalso the Germans, whom he had amongst his guards, until the defeat of\r\nVarus.  Yet he never permitted a greater force than three cohorts in the\r\ncity, and had no (pretorian) camps [190].  The rest he quartered in the\r\nneighbourhood of the nearest towns, in winter and summer camps.  All the\r\ntroops throughout the empire he reduced to one fixed model with regard to\r\ntheir pay and their pensions; determining these according to their rank\r\nin the army, the time they had served, and their private means; so that\r\nafter their discharge, they might not be tempted by age or necessities to\r\njoin the agitators for a revolution.  For the purpose of providing a fund\r\nalways ready to meet their pay and pensions, he instituted a military\r\nexchequer, and appropriated new taxes to that object.  In order to obtain\r\nthe earliest intelligence of what was passing in the provinces, he\r\nestablished posts, consisting at first of young men stationed at moderate\r\ndistances along the military roads, and afterwards of regular couriers\r\nwith fast vehicles; which appeared to him the most commodious, because\r\nthe persons who were the bearers of dispatches, written on the spot,\r\nmight then be questioned about the business, as occasion occurred.\r\n\r\nL.  In sealing letters-patent, rescripts, or epistles, he at first used\r\nthe figure of a sphinx, afterwards the head of Alexander (111) the Great,\r\nand at last his own, engraved by the hand of Dioscorides; which practice\r\nwas retained by the succeeding emperors.  He was extremely precise in\r\ndating his letters, putting down exactly the time of the day or night at\r\nwhich they were dispatched.\r\n\r\nLI.  Of his clemency and moderation there are abundant and signal\r\ninstances.  For, not to enumerate how many and what persons of the\r\nadverse party he pardoned, received into favour, and suffered to rise to\r\nthe highest eminence in the state; he thought it sufficient to punish\r\nJunius Novatus and Cassius Patavinus, who were both plebeians, one of\r\nthem with a fine, and the other with an easy banishment; although the\r\nformer had published, in the name of young Agrippa, a very scurrilous\r\nletter against him, and the other declared openly, at an entertainment\r\nwhere there was a great deal of company, “that he neither wanted\r\ninclination nor courage to stab him.”  In the trial of Aemilius Aelianus,\r\nof Cordova, when, among other charges exhibited against him, it was\r\nparticularly insisted upon, that he used to calumniate Caesar, he turned\r\nround to the accuser, and said, with an air and tone of passion, “I wish\r\nyou could make that appear; I shall let Aelianus know that I have a\r\ntongue too, and shall speak sharper of him than he ever did of me.”  Nor\r\ndid he, either then or afterwards, make any farther inquiry into the\r\naffair.  And when Tiberius, in a letter, complained of the affront with\r\ngreat earnestness, he returned him an answer in the following terms: “Do\r\nnot, my dear Tiberius, give way to the ardour of youth in this affair;\r\nnor be so indignant that any person should speak ill of me.  It is\r\nenough, for us, if we can prevent any one from really doing us mischief.”\r\n\r\nLII.  Although he knew that it had been customary to decree temples in\r\nhonour of the proconsuls, yet he would not permit them to be erected in\r\nany of the provinces, unless in the joint names of himself and Rome.\r\nWithin the limits of the city, he positively refused any honour of that\r\nkind.  He melted down all the silver statues which had been erected to\r\nhim, and converted the whole into tripods, which he consecrated to the\r\nPalatine Apollo.  And when the people importuned him to accept the\r\ndictatorship, he bent down on one knee, with his toga thrown over his\r\nshoulders, and his breast exposed to view, begging to be excused.\r\n\r\n(112) LIII.  He always abhorred the title of Lord [191], as ill-omened\r\nand offensive.  And when, in a play, performed at the theatre, at which\r\nhe was present, these words were introduced, “O just and gracious lord,”\r\n and the whole company, with joyful acclamations, testified their\r\napprobation of them, as applied to him, he instantly put a stop to their\r\nindecent flattery, by waving his hand, and frowning sternly, and next day\r\npublicly declared his displeasure, in a proclamation.  He never\r\nafterwards would suffer himself to be addressed in that manner, even by\r\nhis own children or grand-children, either in jest or earnest and forbad\r\nthem the use of all such complimentary expressions to one another.  He\r\nrarely entered any city or town, or departed from it, except in the\r\nevening or the night, to avoid giving any person the trouble of\r\ncomplimenting him.  During his consulships, he commonly walked the\r\nstreets on foot; but at other times, rode in a close carriage.  He\r\nadmitted to court even plebeians, in common with people of the higher\r\nranks; receiving the petitions of those who approached him with so much\r\naffability, that he once jocosely rebuked a man, by telling him, “You\r\npresent your memorial with as much hesitation as if you were offering\r\nmoney to an elephant.”  On senate days, he used to pay his respects to\r\nthe Conscript Fathers only in the house, addressing them each by name as\r\nthey sat, without any prompter; and on his departure, he bade each of\r\nthem farewell, while they retained their seats.  In the same manner, he\r\nmaintained with many of them a constant intercourse of mutual civilities,\r\ngiving them his company upon occasions of any particular festivity in\r\ntheir families; until he became advanced in years, and was incommoded by\r\nthe crowd at a wedding.  Being informed that Gallus Terrinius, a senator,\r\nwith whom he had only a slight acquaintance, had suddenly lost his sight,\r\nand under that privation had resolved to starve himself to death, he paid\r\nhim a visit, and by his consolatory admonitions diverted him from his\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nLIV.  On his speaking in the senate, he has been told by (113) one of the\r\nmembers, “I did not understand you,” and by another, “I would contradict\r\nyou, could I do it with safety.”  And sometimes, upon his being so much\r\noffended at the heat with which the debates were conducted in the senate,\r\nas to quit the house in anger, some of the members have repeatedly\r\nexclaimed: “Surely, the senators ought to have liberty of speech on\r\nmatters of government.”  Antistius Labeo, in the election of a new\r\nsenate, when each, as he was named, chose another, nominated Marcus\r\nLepidus, who had formerly been Augustus’s enemy, and was then in\r\nbanishment; and being asked by the latter, “Is there no other person more\r\ndeserving?” he replied, “Every man has his own opinion.”  Nor was any one\r\never molested for his freedom of speech, although it was carried to the\r\nextent of insolence.\r\n\r\nLV.  Even when some infamous libels against him were dispersed in the\r\nsenate-house, he was neither disturbed, nor did he give himself much\r\ntrouble to refute them.  He would not so much as order an enquiry to be\r\nmade after the authors; but only proposed, that, for the future, those\r\nwho published libels or lampoons, in a borrowed name, against any person,\r\nshould be called to account.\r\n\r\nLVI.  Being provoked by some petulant jests, which were designed to\r\nrender him odious, he answered them by a proclamation; and yet he\r\nprevented the senate from passing an act, to restrain the liberties which\r\nwere taken with others in people’s wills.  Whenever he attended at the\r\nelection of magistrates, he went round the tribes, with the candidates of\r\nhis nomination, and begged the votes of the people in the usual manner.\r\nHe likewise gave his own vote in his tribe, as one of the people.  He\r\nsuffered himself to be summoned as a witness upon trials, and not only to\r\nbe questioned, but to be cross-examined, with the utmost patience.  In\r\nbuilding his Forum, he restricted himself in the site, not presuming to\r\ncompel the owners of the neighbouring houses to give up their property.\r\nHe never recommended his sons to the people, without adding these words,\r\n“If they deserve it.”  And upon the audience rising on their entering the\r\ntheatre, while they were yet minors, and giving them applause in a\r\nstanding position, he made it a matter of serious complaint.\r\n\r\n(114) He was desirous that his friends should be great and powerful in\r\nthe state, but have no exclusive privileges, or be exempt from the laws\r\nwhich governed others.  When Asprenas Nonius, an intimate friend of his,\r\nwas tried upon a charge of administering poison at the instance of\r\nCassius Severus, he consulted the senate for their opinion what was his\r\nduty under the circumstances: “For,” said he, “I am afraid, lest, if I\r\nshould stand by him in the cause, I may be supposed to screen a guilty\r\nman; and if I do not, to desert and prejudge a friend.”  With the\r\nunanimous concurrence, therefore, of the senate, he took his seat amongst\r\nhis advocates for several hours, but without giving him the benefit of\r\nspeaking to character, as was usual.  He likewise appeared for his\r\nclients; as on behalf of Scutarius, an old soldier of his, who brought an\r\naction for slander.  He never relieved any one from prosecution but in a\r\nsingle instance, in the case of a man who had given information of the\r\nconspiracy of Muraena; and that he did only by prevailing upon the\r\naccuser, in open court, to drop his prosecution.\r\n\r\nLVII.  How much he was beloved for his worthy conduct in all these\r\nrespects, it is easy to imagine.  I say nothing of the decrees of the\r\nsenate in his honour, which may seem to have resulted from compulsion or\r\ndeference.  The Roman knights voluntarily, and with one accord, always\r\ncelebrated his birth for two days together; and all ranks of the people,\r\nyearly, in performance of a vow they had made, threw a piece of money\r\ninto the Curtian lake [192], as an offering for his welfare.  They\r\nlikewise, on the calends [first] of January, presented for his acceptance\r\nnew-year’s gifts in the Capitol, though he was not present with which\r\ndonations he purchased some costly images of the Gods, which he erected\r\nin several streets of the city; as that of Apollo Sandaliarius, Jupiter\r\nTragoedus [193], and others.  When his house on the Palatine hill was\r\naccidentally destroyed by fire, the veteran soldiers, the judges, the\r\ntribes, and even the people, individually, contributed, according to the\r\nability of each, for rebuilding it; but he would (115) accept only of\r\nsome small portion out of the several sums collected, and refused to take\r\nfrom any one person more than a single denarius [194].  Upon his return\r\nhome from any of the provinces, they attended him not only with joyful\r\nacclamations, but with songs.  It is also remarked, that as often as he\r\nentered the city, the infliction of punishment was suspended for the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nLVIII.  The whole body of the people, upon a sudden impulse, and with\r\nunanimous consent, offered him the title of FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY.  It\r\nwas announced to him first at Antium, by a deputation from the people,\r\nand upon his declining the honour, they repeated their offer on his\r\nreturn to Rome, in a full theatre, when they were crowned with laurel.\r\nThe senate soon afterwards adopted the proposal, not in the way of\r\nacclamation or decree, but by commissioning M. Messala, in an unanimous\r\nvote, to compliment him with it in the following terms: “With hearty\r\nwishes for the happiness and prosperity of yourself and your family,\r\nCaesar Augustus, (for we think we thus most effectually pray for the\r\nlasting welfare of the state), the senate, in agreement with the Roman\r\npeople, salute you by the title of FATHER OF YOUR COUNTRY.”  To this\r\ncompliment Augustus replied, with tears in his eyes, in these words (for\r\nI give them exactly as I have done those of Messala): “Having now arrived\r\nat the summit of my wishes, O Conscript Fathers [195], what else have I\r\nto beg of the Immortal (116) Gods, but the continuance of this your\r\naffection for me to the last moments of my life?”\r\n\r\nLIX.  To the physician Antonius Musa [196], who had cured him of a\r\ndangerous illness, they erected a statue near that of Aesculapius, by a\r\ngeneral subscription.  Some heads of families ordered in their wills,\r\nthat their heirs should lead victims to the Capitol, with a tablet\r\ncarried before them, and pay their vows, “Because Augustus still\r\nsurvived.”  Some Italian cities appointed the day upon which he first\r\nvisited them, to be thenceforth the beginning of their year.  And most of\r\nthe provinces, besides erecting temples and altars, instituted games, to\r\nbe celebrated to his honour, in most towns, every five years.\r\n\r\nLX.  The kings, his friends and allies, built cities in their respective\r\nkingdoms, to which they gave the name of Caesarea; and all with one\r\nconsent resolved to finish, at their common expense, the temple of\r\nJupiter Olympius, at Athens, which had been begun long before, and\r\nconsecrate it to his Genius.  They frequently also left their kingdoms,\r\nlaid aside the badges of royalty, and assuming the toga, attended and\r\npaid their respects to him daily, in the manner of clients to their\r\npatrons; not only at Rome, but when he was travelling through the\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nLXI.  Having thus given an account of the manner in which he filled his\r\npublic offices both civil and military, and his conduct in the government\r\nof the empire, both in peace and war; I shall now describe his private\r\nand domestic life, his habits at home and among his friends and\r\ndependents, and the fortune attending him in those scenes of retirement,\r\nfrom his youth to the day of his death.  He lost his mother in his first\r\nconsulship, and his sister Octavia, when he was in the fifty-fourth year\r\nof his age [197].  He behaved towards them both with the utmost kindness\r\nwhilst living, and after their decease paid the highest honours to their\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n(117) LXII.  He was contracted when very young to the daughter of Publius\r\nServilius Isauricus; but upon his reconciliation with Antony after their\r\nfirst rupture [198], the armies on both sides insisting on a family\r\nalliance between them, he married Antony’s step-daughter Claudia, the\r\ndaughter of Fulvia by Publius Claudius, although at that time she was\r\nscarcely marriageable; and upon a difference arising with his\r\nmother-in-law Fulvia, he divorced her untouched, and a pure virgin.  Soon\r\nafterwards he took to wife Scribonia, who had before been twice married\r\nto men of consular rank [199], and was a mother by one of them.  With her\r\nlikewise he parted [200], being quite tired out, as he himself writes,\r\nwith the perverseness of her temper; and immediately took Livia Drusilla,\r\nthough then pregnant, from her husband Tiberius Nero; and she had never\r\nany rival in his love and esteem.\r\n\r\nLXIII.  By Scribonia he had a daughter named Julia, but no children by\r\nLivia, although extremely desirous of issue.  She, indeed, conceived\r\nonce, but miscarried.  He gave his daughter Julia in the first instance\r\nto Marcellus, his sister’s son, who had just completed his minority; and,\r\nafter his death, to Marcus Agrippa, having prevailed with his sister to\r\nyield her son-in-law to his wishes; for at that time Agrippa was married\r\nto one of the Marcellas, and had children by her.  Agrippa dying also, he\r\nfor a long time thought of several matches for Julia in even the\r\nequestrian order, and at last resolved upon selecting Tiberius for his\r\nstep-son; and he obliged him to part with his wife at that time pregnant,\r\nand who had already brought him a child.  Mark Antony writes, “That he\r\nfirst contracted Julia to his son, and afterwards to Cotiso, king of the\r\nGetae [201], demanding at the same time the king’s daughter in marriage\r\nfor himself.”\r\n\r\n(118) LXIV.  He had three grandsons by Agrippa and Julia, namely, Caius,\r\nLucius, and Agrippa; and two grand-daughters, Julia and Agrippina.  Julia\r\nhe married to Lucius Paulus, the censor’s son, and Agrippina to\r\nGermanicus, his sister’s grandson.  Caius and Lucius he adopted at home,\r\nby the ceremony of purchase [202] from their father, advanced them, while\r\nyet very young, to offices in the state, and when they were\r\nconsuls-elect, sent them to visit the provinces and armies.  In bringing\r\nup his daughter and grand-daughters, he accustomed them to domestic\r\nemployments, and even spinning, and obliged them to speak and act every\r\nthing openly before the family, that it might be put down in the diary.\r\nHe so strictly prohibited them from all converse with strangers, that he\r\nonce wrote a letter to Lucius Vinicius, a handsome young man of a good\r\nfamily, in which he told him, “You have not behaved very modestly, in\r\nmaking a visit to my daughter at Baiae.”  He usually instructed his\r\ngrandsons himself in reading, swimming, and other rudiments of knowledge;\r\nand he laboured nothing more than to perfect them in the imitation of his\r\nhand-writing.  He never supped but he had them sitting at the foot of his\r\ncouch; nor ever travelled but with them in a chariot before him, or riding\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\nLXV.  But in the midst of all his joy and hopes in his numerous and\r\nwell-regulated family, his fortune failed him.  The two Julias, his\r\ndaughter and grand-daughter, abandoned themselves to such courses of\r\nlewdness and debauchery, that he banished them both.  Caius and Lucius he\r\nlost within the space of eighteen months; the former dying in Lycia, and\r\nthe latter at Marseilles.  His third grandson Agrippa, with his step-son\r\nTiberius, he adopted in the forum, by a law passed for the purpose by the\r\nSections [203]; but he soon afterwards discarded Agrippa for his coarse\r\nand unruly temper, and confined him at Surrentum.  He bore the death of\r\nhis relations with more patience than he did their disgrace; for he was\r\nnot overwhelmed by the loss of Caius and Lucius; but in the case of his\r\ndaughter, he stated the facts to the senate in a message read to them by\r\n(119) the quaestor, not having the heart to be present himself; indeed, he\r\nwas so much ashamed of her infamous conduct, that for some time he avoided\r\nall company, and had thoughts of putting her to death.  It is certain that\r\nwhen one Phoebe, a freed-woman and confidant of hers, hanged herself about\r\nthe same time, he said, “I had rather be the father of Phoebe than of\r\nJulia.”  In her banishment he would not allow her the use of wine, nor any\r\nluxury in dress; nor would he suffer her to be waited upon by any male\r\nservant, either freeman or slave, without his permission, and having\r\nreceived an exact account of his age, stature, complexion, and what marks\r\nor scars he had about him.  At the end of five years he removed her from\r\nthe island [where she was confined] to the continent [204], and treated\r\nher with less severity, but could never be prevailed upon to recall her.\r\nWhen the Roman people interposed on her behalf several times with much\r\nimportunity, all the reply he gave was: “I wish you had all such daughters\r\nand wives as she is.”  He likewise forbad a child, of which his\r\ngrand-daughter Julia was delivered after sentence had passed against her,\r\nto be either owned as a relation, or brought up. Agrippa, who was equally\r\nintractable, and whose folly increased every day, he transported to an\r\nisland [205], and placed a guard of soldiers about him; procuring at the\r\nsame time an act of the senate for his confinement there during life.\r\nUpon any mention of him and the two Julias, he would say, with a heavy\r\nsigh,\r\n\r\n    Aith’ ophelon agamos t’ emenai, agonos t’ apoletai.\r\n\r\n    Would I were wifeless, or had childless died! [206]\r\n\r\nnor did he usually call them by any other name than that of his “three\r\nimposthumes or cancers.”\r\n\r\nLXVI.  He was cautious in forming friendships, but clung to them with\r\ngreat constancy; not only rewarding the virtues and merits of his friends\r\naccording to their deserts, but bearing likewise with their faults and\r\nvices, provided that they were (120) of a venial kind.  For amongst all\r\nhis friends, we scarcely find any who fell into disgrace with him, except\r\nSalvidienus Rufus, whom he raised to the consulship, and Cornelius\r\nGallus, whom he made prefect of Egypt; both of them men of the lowest\r\nextraction.  One of these, being engaged in plotting a rebellion, he\r\ndelivered over to the senate, for condemnation; and the other, on account\r\nof his ungrateful and malicious temper, he forbad his house, and his\r\nliving in any of the provinces.  When, however, Gallus, being denounced\r\nby his accusers, and sentenced by the senate, was driven to the desperate\r\nextremity of laying violent hands upon himself, he commended, indeed, the\r\nattachment to his person of those who manifested so much indignation, but\r\nhe shed tears, and lamented his unhappy condition, “That I alone,” said\r\nhe, “cannot be allowed to resent the misconduct of my friends in such a\r\nway only as I would wish.”  The rest of his friends of all orders\r\nflourished during their whole lives, both in power and wealth, in the\r\nhighest ranks of their several orders, notwithstanding some occasional\r\nlapses.  For, to say nothing of others, he sometimes complained that\r\nAgrippa was hasty, and Mecaenas a tattler; the former having thrown up\r\nall his employments and retired to Mitylene, on suspicion of some slight\r\ncoolness, and from jealousy that Marcellus received greater marks of\r\nfavour; and the latter having confidentially imparted to his wife\r\nTerentia the discovery of Muraena’s conspiracy.\r\n\r\nHe likewise expected from his friends, at their deaths as well as during\r\ntheir lives, some proofs of their reciprocal attachment.  For though he\r\nwas far from coveting their property, and indeed would never accept of\r\nany legacy left him by a stranger, yet he pondered in a melancholy mood\r\nover their last words; not being able to conceal his chagrin, if in their\r\nwills they made but a slight, or no very honourable mention of him, nor\r\nhis joy, on the other hand, if they expressed a grateful sense of his\r\nfavours, and a hearty affection for him.  And whatever legacies or shares\r\nof their property were left him by such as were parents, he used to\r\nrestore to their children, either immediately, or if they were under age,\r\nupon the day of their assuming the manly dress, or of their marriage;\r\nwith interest.\r\n\r\nLXVII.  As a patron and master, his behaviour in general was mild and\r\nconciliating; but when occasion required it, he (121) could be severe.\r\nHe advanced many of his freedmen to posts of honour and great importance,\r\nas Licinus, Enceladus, and others; and when his slave, Cosmus, had\r\nreflected bitterly upon him, he resented the injury no further than by\r\nputting him in fetters.  When his steward, Diomedes, left him to the\r\nmercy of a wild boar, which suddenly attacked them while they were\r\nwalking together, he considered it rather a cowardice than a breach of\r\nduty; and turned an occurrence of no small hazard into a jest, because\r\nthere was no knavery in his steward’s conduct.  He put to death Proculus,\r\none of his most favourite freedmen, for maintaining a criminal commerce\r\nwith other men’s wives.  He broke the legs of his secretary, Thallus, for\r\ntaking a bribe of five hundred denarii to discover the contents of one of\r\nhis letters.  And the tutor and other attendants of his son Caius, having\r\ntaken advantage of his sickness and death, to give loose to their\r\ninsolence and rapacity in the province he governed, he caused heavy\r\nweights to be tied about their necks, and had them thrown into a river.\r\n\r\nLXVIII.  In his early youth various aspersions of an infamous character\r\nwere heaped upon him.  Sextus Pompey reproached him with being an\r\neffeminate fellow; and M. Antony, with earning his adoption from his\r\nuncle by prostitution.  Lucius Antony, likewise Mark’s brother, charges\r\nhim with pollution by Caesar; and that, for a gratification of three\r\nhundred thousand sesterces, he had submitted to Aulus Hirtius in the same\r\nway, in Spain; adding, that he used to singe his legs with burnt\r\nnut-shells, to make the hair become softer [207].  Nay, the whole\r\nconcourse of the people, at some public diversions in the theatre, when\r\nthe following sentence was recited, alluding to the Gallic priest of the\r\nmother of the gods [208], beating a drum [209],\r\n\r\n    Videsne ut cinaedus orbem digito temperet?\r\n    See with his orb the wanton’s finger play!\r\n\r\napplied the passage to him, with great applause.\r\n\r\n(122) LXIX.  That he was guilty of various acts of adultery, is not\r\ndenied even by his friends; but they allege in excuse for it, that he\r\nengaged in those intrigues not from lewdness, but from policy, in order\r\nto discover more easily the designs of his enemies, through their wives.\r\nMark Antony, besides the precipitate marriage of Livia, charges him with\r\ntaking the wife of a man of consular rank from table, in the presence of\r\nher husband, into a bed-chamber, and bringing her again to the\r\nentertainment, with her ears very red, and her hair in great disorder:\r\nthat he had divorced Scribonia, for resenting too freely the excessive\r\ninfluence which one of his mistresses had gained over him: that his\r\nfriends were employed to pimp for him, and accordingly obliged both\r\nmatrons and ripe virgins to strip, for a complete examination of their\r\npersons, in the same manner as if Thoranius, the dealer in slaves, had\r\nthem under sale.  And before they came to an open rupture, he writes to\r\nhim in a familiar manner, thus: “Why are you changed towards me?  Because\r\nI lie with a queen?  She is my wife.  Is this a new thing with me, or\r\nhave I not done so for these nine years?  And do you take freedoms with\r\nDrusilla only?  May health and happiness so attend you, as when you read\r\nthis letter, you are not in dalliance with Tertulla, Terentilla, Rufilla\r\n[210], or Salvia Titiscenia, or all of them.  What matters it to you\r\nwhere, or upon whom, you spend your manly vigour?”\r\n\r\nLXX.  A private entertainment which he gave, commonly called the Supper\r\nof the Twelve Gods [211], and at which the guests (123) were dressed in\r\nthe habit of gods and goddesses, while he personated Apollo himself,\r\nafforded subject of much conversation, and was imputed to him not only by\r\nAntony in his letters, who likewise names all the parties concerned, but\r\nin the following well-known anonymous verses:\r\n\r\n    Cum primum istorum conduxit mensa choragum,\r\n      Sexque deos vidit Mallia, sexque deas\r\n    Impia dum Phoebi Caesar mendacia ludit,\r\n      Dum nova divorum coenat adulteria:\r\n    Omnia se a terris tunc numina declinarunt:\r\n      Fugit et auratos Jupiter ipse thronos.\r\n\r\n    When Mallia late beheld, in mingled train,\r\n    Twelve mortals ape twelve deities in vain;\r\n    Caesar assumed what was Apollo’s due,\r\n    And wine and lust inflamed the motley crew.\r\n    At the foul sight the gods avert their eyes,\r\n    And from his throne great Jove indignant flies.\r\n\r\nWhat rendered this supper more obnoxious to public censure, was that it\r\nhappened at a time when there was a great scarcity, and almost a famine,\r\nin the city.  The day after, there was a cry current among the people,\r\n“that the gods had eaten up all the corn; and that Caesar was indeed\r\nApollo, but Apollo the Tormentor;” under which title that god was\r\nworshipped in some quarter of the city [212].  He was likewise charged\r\nwith being excessively fond of fine furniture, and Corinthian vessels, as\r\nwell as with being addicted to gaming.  For, during the time of the\r\nproscription, the following line was written upon his statue:--\r\n\r\n    Pater argentarius, ego Corinthiarius;\r\n    My father was a silversmith [213], my dealings are in brass;\r\n\r\nbecause it was believed, that he had put some persons upon the list of\r\nthe proscribed, only to obtain the Corinthian vessels in (124) their\r\npossession.  And afterwards, in the Sicilian war, the following epigram\r\nwas published:--\r\n\r\n    Postquam bis classe victus naves perdidit,\r\n    Aliquando ut vincat, ludit assidue aleam.\r\n\r\n    Twice having lost a fleet in luckless fight,\r\n    To win at last, he games both day and night.\r\n\r\nLXXI.  With respect to the charge or imputation of loathsome impurity\r\nbefore-mentioned, he very easily refuted it by the chastity of his life,\r\nat the very time when it was made, as well as ever afterwards.  His\r\nconduct likewise gave the lie to that of luxurious extravagance in his\r\nfurniture, when, upon the taking of Alexandria, he reserved for himself\r\nnothing of the royal treasures but a porcelain cup, and soon afterwards\r\nmelted down all the vessels of gold, even such as were intended for\r\ncommon use.  But his amorous propensities never left him, and, as he grew\r\nolder, as is reported, he was in the habit of debauching young girls, who\r\nwere procured for him, from all quarters, even by his own wife.  To the\r\nobservations on his gaming, he paid not the smallest regard; but played\r\nin public, but purely for his diversion, even when he was advanced in\r\nyears; and not only in the month of December [214], but at other times,\r\nand upon all days, whether festivals or not.  This evidently appears from\r\na letter under his own hand, in which he says, “I supped, my dear\r\nTiberius, with the same company.  We had, besides, Vinicius, and Silvius\r\nthe father.  We gamed at supper like old fellows, both yesterday and\r\ntoday.  And as any one threw upon the tali [215] aces or sixes, he put\r\ndown for every talus a denarius; all which was gained by him who threw a\r\nVenus.” [216]  In another letter, he says: “We had, my dear Tiberius, a\r\npleasant time of it during the festival of Minerva: for we played every\r\nday, and kept the gaming-board warm.  Your brother uttered many\r\nexclamations at a desperate run of ill-fortune; but recovering by\r\ndegrees, and unexpectedly, he in the end lost not much.  I lost twenty\r\nthousand sesterces for my part; but then I was profusely (125) generous\r\nin my play, as I commonly am; for had I insisted upon the stakes which I\r\ndeclined, or kept what I gave away, I should have won about fifty\r\nthousand.  But this I like better for it will raise my character for\r\ngenerosity to the skies.”  In a letter to his daughter, he writes thus:\r\n“I have sent you two hundred and fifty denarii, which I gave to every one\r\nof my guests; in case they were inclined at supper to divert themselves\r\nwith the Tali, or at the game of Even-or-Odd.”\r\n\r\nLXXII.  In other matters, it appears that he was moderate in his habits,\r\nand free from suspicion of any kind of vice.  He lived at first near the\r\nRoman Forum, above the Ring-maker’s Stairs, in a house which had once\r\nbeen occupied by Calvus the orator.  He afterwards moved to the Palatine\r\nHill, where he resided in a small house [217] belonging to Hortensius, no\r\nway remarkable either for size or ornament; the piazzas being but small,\r\nthe pillars of Alban stone [218], and the rooms without any thing of\r\nmarble, or fine paving.  He continued to use the same bed-chamber, both\r\nwinter and summer, during forty years [219]: for though he was sensible\r\nthat the city did not agree with his health in the winter, he\r\nnevertheless resided constantly in it during that season.  If at any time\r\nhe wished to be perfectly retired, and secure from interruption, he shut\r\nhimself up in an apartment at the top of his house, which he called his\r\nSyracuse or Technophuon [220], or he went to some villa belonging to his\r\nfreedmen near the city.  But when he was indisposed, he commonly took up\r\nhis residence in the house of Mecaenas [221].  Of all the places of\r\nretirement from the city, he (126) chiefly frequented those upon the\r\nsea-coast, and the islands of Campania [222], or the towns nearest the\r\ncity, such as Lanuvium, Praeneste, and Tibur [223], where he often used to\r\nsit for the administration of justice, in the porticos of the temple of\r\nHercules.  He had a particular aversion to large and sumptuous palaces;\r\nand some which had been raised at a vast expense by his grand-daughter,\r\nJulia, he levelled to the ground.  Those of his own, which were far from\r\nbeing spacious, he adorned, not so much with statues and pictures, as with\r\nwalks and groves, and things which were curious either for their antiquity\r\nor rarity; such as, at Capri, the huge limbs of sea-monsters and wild\r\nbeasts, which some affect to call the bones of giants; and also the arms\r\nof ancient heroes.\r\n\r\nLXXIII.  His frugality in the furniture of his house appears even at this\r\nday, from some beds and tables still remaining, most of which are\r\nscarcely elegant enough for a private family.  It is reported that he\r\nnever lay upon a bed, but such as was low, and meanly furnished.  He\r\nseldom wore any garment but what was made by the hands of his wife,\r\nsister, daughter, and grand-daughters.  His togas [224] were neither\r\nscanty nor full; (127) and the clavus was neither remarkably broad or\r\nnarrow.  His shoes were a little higher than common, to make him appear\r\ntaller than he was.  He had always clothes and shoes, fit to appear in\r\npublic, ready in his bed-chamber for any sudden occasion.\r\n\r\nLXXIV.  At his table, which was always plentiful and elegant, he\r\nconstantly entertained company; but was very scrupulous in the choice of\r\nthem, both as to rank and character.  Valerius Messala informs us, that\r\nhe never admitted any freedman to his table, except Menas, when rewarded\r\nwith the privilege of citizenship, for betraying Pompey’s fleet.  He\r\nwrites, himself, that he invited to his table a person in whose villa he\r\nlodged, and who had formerly been employed by him as a spy.  He often\r\ncame late to table, and withdrew early; so that the company began supper\r\nbefore his arrival, and continued at table after his departure.  His\r\nentertainments consisted of three entries, or at most of only six.  But\r\nif his fare was moderate, his courtesy was extreme.  For those who were\r\nsilent, or talked in whispers, he encouraged to join in the general\r\nconversation; and introduced buffoons and stage players, or even low\r\nperformers from the circus, and very often itinerant humourists, to\r\nenliven the company.\r\n\r\nLXXV.  Festivals and holidays he usually celebrated very expensively, but\r\nsometimes only with merriment.  In the Saturnalia, or at any other time\r\nwhen the fancy took him, he distributed to his company clothes, gold, and\r\nsilver; sometimes coins of all sorts, even of the ancient kings of Rome\r\nand of foreign nations; sometimes nothing but towels, sponges, rakes, and\r\ntweezers, and other things of that kind, with tickets on them, which were\r\nenigmatical, and had a double meaning [225].  He used likewise to sell by\r\nlot among his guests articles of very unequal value, and pictures with\r\ntheir fronts reversed; and so, by the unknown quality of the lot,\r\ndisappoint or gratify the expectation of the purchasers.  This sort of\r\ntraffic (128) went round the whole company, every one being obliged to\r\nbuy something, and to run the chance of loss or gain wits the rest.\r\n\r\nLXXVI.  He ate sparingly (for I must not omit even this), and commonly\r\nused a plain diet.  He was particularly fond of coarse bread, small\r\nfishes, new cheese made of cow’s milk [226], and green figs of the sort\r\nwhich bear fruit twice a year [227].  He did not wait for supper, but\r\ntook food at any time, and in any place, when he had an appetite.  The\r\nfollowing passages relative to this subject, I have transcribed from his\r\nletters.  “I ate a little bread and some small dates, in my carriage.”\r\n Again.  “In returning home from the palace in my litter, I ate an ounce\r\nof bread, and a few raisins.”  Again.  “No Jew, my dear Tiberius, ever\r\nkeeps such strict fast upon the Sabbath [228], as I have to-day; for\r\nwhile in the bath, and after the first hour of the night, I only ate two\r\nbiscuits, before I began to be rubbed with oil.”  From this great\r\nindifference about his diet, he sometimes supped by himself, before his\r\ncompany began, or after they had finished, and would not touch a morsel\r\nat table with his guests.\r\n\r\nLXXVII.  He was by nature extremely sparing in the use of wine.\r\nCornelius Nepos says, that he used to drink only three times at supper in\r\nthe camp at Modena; and when he indulged himself the most, he never\r\nexceeded a pint; or if he did, his stomach rejected it.  Of all wines, he\r\ngave the (129) preference to the Rhaetian [229], but scarcely ever drank\r\nany in the day-time.  Instead of drinking, he used to take a piece of\r\nbread dipped in cold water, or a slice of cucumber, or some leaves of\r\nlettuce, or a green, sharp, juicy apple.\r\n\r\nLXXVIII.  After a slight repast at noon, he used to seek repose [230],\r\ndressed as he was, and with his shoes on, his feet covered, and his hand\r\nheld before his eyes.  After supper he commonly withdrew to his study, a\r\nsmall closet, where he sat late, until he had put down in his diary all\r\nor most of the remaining transactions of the day, which he had not before\r\nregistered.  He would then go to bed, but never slept above seven hours\r\nat most, and that not without interruption; for he would wake three or\r\nfour times during that time.  If he could not again fall asleep, as\r\nsometimes happened, he called for some one to read or tell stories to\r\nhim, until he became drowsy, and then his sleep was usually protracted\r\ntill after day-break.  He never liked to lie awake in the dark, without\r\nsomebody to sit by him.  Very early rising was apt to disagree with him.\r\nOn which account, if he was obliged to rise betimes, for any civil or\r\nreligious functions, in order to guard as much as possible against the\r\ninconvenience resulting from it, he used to lodge in some apartment near\r\nthe spot, belonging to any of his attendants.  If at any time a fit of\r\ndrowsiness seized him in passing along the streets, his litter was set\r\ndown while he snatched a few moments’ sleep.\r\n\r\nLXXIX.  In person he was handsome and graceful, through every period of\r\nhis life.  But he was negligent in his dress; and so careless about\r\ndressing his hair, that he usually had it done in great haste, by several\r\nbarbers at a time.  His beard he sometimes clipped, and sometimes shaved;\r\nand either read or wrote during the operation.  His countenance, either\r\nwhen discoursing or silent, was so calm and serene, that a (130) Gaul of\r\nthe first rank declared amongst his friends, that he was so softened by\r\nit, as to be restrained from throwing him down a precipice, in his\r\npassage over the Alps, when he had been admitted to approach him, under\r\npretence of conferring with him.  His eyes were bright and piercing; and\r\nhe was willing it should be thought that there was something of a divine\r\nvigour in them.  He was likewise not a little pleased to see people, upon\r\nhis looking steadfastly at them, lower their countenances, as if the sun\r\nshone in their eyes.  But in his old age, he saw very imperfectly with\r\nhis left eye.  His teeth were thin set, small and scaly, his hair a\r\nlittle curled, and inclining to a yellow colour.  His eye-brows met; his\r\nears were small, and he had an aquiline nose.  His complexion was betwixt\r\nbrown and fair; his stature but low; though Julius Marathus, his\r\nfreedman, says he was five feet and nine inches in height.  This,\r\nhowever, was so much concealed by the just proportion of his limbs, that\r\nit was only perceivable upon comparison with some taller person standing\r\nby him.\r\n\r\nLXXX.  He is said to have been born with many spots upon his breast and\r\nbelly, answering to the figure, order, and number of the stars in the\r\nconstellation of the Bear.  He had besides several callosities resembling\r\nscars, occasioned by an itching in his body, and the constant and violent\r\nuse of the strigil [231] in being rubbed.  He had a weakness in his left\r\nhip, thigh, and leg, insomuch that he often halted on that side; but he\r\nreceived much benefit from the use of sand and reeds.  He likewise\r\nsometimes found the fore-finger of his right hand so weak, that when it\r\nwas benumbed and contracted with cold, to use it in writing, he was\r\nobliged to have recourse to a circular piece of horn.  He had\r\noccasionally a complaint in the bladder; but upon voiding some stones in\r\nhis urine, he was relieved from that pain.\r\n\r\nLXXXI.  During the whole course of his life, he suffered, at times,\r\ndangerous fits of sickness, especially after the conquest of Cantabria;\r\nwhen his liver being injured by a defluxion (131) upon it, he was reduced\r\nto such a condition, that he was obliged to undergo a desperate and\r\ndoubtful method of cure: for warm applications having no effect, Antonius\r\nMusa [232] directed the use of those which were cold.  He was likewise\r\nsubject to fits of sickness at stated times every year; for about his\r\nbirth-day [233] he was commonly a little indisposed.  In the beginning of\r\nspring, he was attacked with an inflation of the midriff; and when the\r\nwind was southerly, with a cold in his head.  By all these complaints,\r\nhis constitution was so shattered, that he could not easily bear either\r\nheat or cold.\r\n\r\nLXXXII.  In winter, he was protected against the inclemency of the\r\nweather by a thick toga, four tunics, a shirt, a flannel stomacher, and\r\nswathings upon his legs and thighs [234]. In summer, he lay with the\r\ndoors of his bedchamber open, and frequently in a piazza, refreshed by a\r\nbubbling fountain, and a person standing by to fan him.  He could not\r\nbear even the winter’s sun; and at home, never walked in the open air\r\nwithout a broad-brimmed hat on his head.  He usually travelled in a\r\nlitter, and by night: and so slow, that he was two days in going to\r\nPraeneste or Tibur.  And if he could go to any place by sea, he preferred\r\nthat mode of travelling.  He carefully nourished his health against his\r\nmany infirmities, avoiding chiefly the free use of the bath; but he was\r\noften rubbed with oil, and sweated in a stove; after which he was washed\r\nwith tepid water, warmed either by a fire, or by being exposed to the\r\nheat of the sun.  When, upon account of his nerves, he was obliged to\r\nhave recourse to sea-water, or the waters of Albula [235], he was\r\ncontented with sitting over a wooden tub, which he called by a Spanish\r\nname (132) Dureta, and plunging his hands and feet in the water by turns.\r\n\r\nLXXXIII.  As soon as the civil wars were ended, he gave up riding and\r\nother military exercises in the Campus Martius, and took to playing at\r\nball, or foot-ball; but soon afterwards used no other exercise than that\r\nof going abroad in his litter, or walking.  Towards the end of his walk,\r\nhe would run leaping, wrapped up in a short cloak or cape.  For amusement\r\nhe would sometimes angle, or play with dice, pebbles, or nuts, with\r\nlittle boys, collected from various countries, and particularly Moors and\r\nSyrians, for their beauty or amusing talk.  But dwarfs, and such as were\r\nin any way deformed, he held in abhorrence, as lusus naturae (nature’s\r\nabortions), and of evil omen.\r\n\r\nLXXXIV.  From early youth he devoted himself with great diligence and\r\napplication to the study of eloquence, and the other liberal arts.  In\r\nthe war of Modena, notwithstanding the weighty affairs in which he was\r\nengaged, he is said to have read, written, and declaimed every day.  He\r\nnever addressed the senate, the people, or the army, but in a\r\npremeditated speech, though he did not want the talent of speaking\r\nextempore on the spur of the occasion.  And lest his memory should fail\r\nhim, as well as to prevent the loss of time in getting up his speeches,\r\nit was his general practice to recite them.  In his intercourse with\r\nindividuals, and even with his wife Livia, upon subjects of importance he\r\nwrote on his tablets all he wished to express, lest, if he spoke\r\nextempore, he should say more or less than was proper.  He delivered\r\nhimself in a sweet and peculiar tone, in which he was diligently\r\ninstructed by a master of elocution.  But when he had a cold, he\r\nsometimes employed a herald to deliver his speeches to the people.\r\n\r\nLXXXV.  He composed many tracts in prose on various subjects, some of\r\nwhich he read occasionally in the circle of his friends, as to an\r\nauditory.  Among these was his “Rescript to Brutus respecting Cato.”\r\n Most of the pages he read himself, although he was advanced in years, but\r\nbecoming fatigued, he gave the rest to Tiberius to finish.  He likewise\r\nread over to (133) his friends his “Exhortations to Philosophy,” and the\r\n“History of his own Life,” which he continued in thirteen books, as far\r\nas the Cantabrian war, but no farther.  He likewise made some attempts at\r\npoetry.  There is extant one book written by him in hexameter verse, of\r\nwhich both the subject and title is “Sicily.”  There is also a book of\r\nEpigrams, no larger than the last, which he composed almost entirely\r\nwhile he was in the bath.  These are all his poetical compositions for\r\nthough he begun a tragedy with great zest, becoming dissatisfied with the\r\nstyle, he obliterated the whole; and his friends saying to him, “What is\r\nyour Ajax doing?” he answered, “My Ajax has met with a sponge.” [236]\r\n\r\nLXXXVI.  He cultivated a style which was neat and chaste, avoiding\r\nfrivolous or harsh language, as well as obsolete words, which he calls\r\ndisgusting.  His chief object was to deliver his thoughts with all\r\npossible perspicuity.  To attain this end, and that he might nowhere\r\nperplex, or retard the reader or hearer, he made no scruple to add\r\nprepositions to his verbs, or to repeat the same conjunction several\r\ntimes; which, when omitted, occasion some little obscurity, but give a\r\ngrace to the style.  Those who used affected language, or adopted\r\nobsolete words, he despised, as equally faulty, though in different ways.\r\nHe sometimes indulged himself in jesting, particularly with his friend\r\nMecaenas, whom he rallied upon all occasions for his fine phrases [237],\r\nand bantered by imitating his way of talking.  Nor did he spare Tiberius,\r\nwho was fond of obsolete and far-fetched expressions.  He charges Mark\r\nAntony with insanity, writing rather to make men stare, than to be\r\nunderstood; and by way of sarcasm upon his depraved and fickle taste in\r\nthe choice of words, he writes to him thus: “And are you yet in doubt,\r\nwhether Cimber Annius or Veranius Flaccus be more proper for your\r\nimitation?  Whether you will adopt words which Sallustius Crispus has\r\nborrowed from the ‘Origines’ of Cato?  Or do you think that the verbose\r\nempty bombast of Asiatic orators is fit to be transfused into (134) our\r\nlanguage?”  And in a letter where he commends the talent of his\r\ngrand-daughter, Agrippina, he says, “But you must be particularly careful,\r\nboth in writing and speaking, to avoid affectation.”\r\n\r\nLXXXVII.  In ordinary conversation, he made use of several peculiar\r\nexpressions, as appears from letters in his own hand-writing; in which,\r\nnow and then, when he means to intimate that some persons would never pay\r\ntheir debts, he says, “They will pay at the Greek Calends.”  And when he\r\nadvised patience in the present posture of affairs, he would say, “Let us\r\nbe content with our Cato.”  To describe anything in haste, he said, “It\r\nwas sooner done than asparagus is cooked.”  He constantly puts baceolus\r\nfor stultus, pullejaceus for pullus, vacerrosus for cerritus, vapide se\r\nhabere for male, and betizare for languere, which is commonly called\r\nlachanizare.  Likewise simus for sumus, domos for domus in the genitive\r\nsingular [238].  With respect to the last two peculiarities, lest any\r\nperson should imagine that they were only slips of his pen, and not\r\ncustomary with him, he never varies.  I have likewise remarked this\r\nsingularity in his hand-writing; he never divides his words, so as to\r\ncarry the letters which cannot be inserted at the end of a line to the\r\nnext, but puts them below the other, enclosed by a bracket.\r\n\r\nLXXXVIII.  He did not adhere strictly to orthography as laid down by the\r\ngrammarians, but seems to have been of the opinion of those who think,\r\nthat we ought to write as we speak; for as to his changing and omitting\r\nnot only letters but whole syllables, it is a vulgar mistake.  Nor should\r\nI have taken notice of it, but that it appears strange to me, that any\r\nperson should have told us, that he sent a successor to a consular\r\nlieutenant of a province, as an ignorant, illiterate fellow, upon his\r\nobserving that he had written ixi for ipsi.  When he had occasion to\r\nwrite in cypher, he put b for a, c for b, and so forth; and instead\r\nof z, aa.\r\n\r\nLXXXIX.  He was no less fond of the Greek literature, in which he made\r\nconsiderable proficiency; having had Apollodorus (135) of Pergamus, for\r\nhis master in rhetoric; whom, though much advanced in years, he took with\r\nhim from The City, when he was himself very young, to Apollonia.\r\nAfterwards, being instructed in philology by Sephaerus, he received into\r\nhis family Areus the philosopher, and his sons Dionysius and Nicanor; but\r\nhe never could speak the Greek tongue readily, nor ever ventured to\r\ncompose in it.  For if there was occasion for him to deliver his\r\nsentiments in that language, he always expressed what he had to say in\r\nLatin, and gave it another to translate.  He was evidently not\r\nunacquainted with the poetry of the Greeks, and had a great taste for the\r\nancient comedy, which he often brought upon the stage, in his public\r\nspectacles.  In reading the Greek and Latin authors, he paid particular\r\nattention to precepts and examples which might be useful in public or\r\nprivate life.  Those he used to extract verbatim, and gave to his\r\ndomestics, or send to the commanders of the armies, the governors of the\r\nprovinces, or the magistrates of the city, when any of them seemed to\r\nstand in need of admonition.  He likewise read whole books to the senate,\r\nand frequently made them known to the people by his edicts; such as the\r\norations of Quintus Metellus “for the Encouragement of Marriage,” and\r\nthose of Rutilius “On the Style of Building;” [239] to shew the people\r\nthat he was not the first who had promoted those objects, but that the\r\nancients likewise had thought them worthy their attention.  He patronised\r\nthe men of genius of that age in every possible way.  He would hear them\r\nread their works with a great deal of patience and good nature; and not\r\nonly poetry [240] and history, but orations and dialogues.  He was\r\ndispleased, however, that anything should be written upon himself, except\r\nin a grave manner, and by men of the most eminent abilities: and he\r\nenjoined the praetors not to suffer his name to be made too common in the\r\ncontests amongst orators and poets in the theatres.\r\n\r\nXC.  We have the following account of him respecting his (136) belief in\r\nomens and such like.  He had so great a dread of thunder and lightning\r\nthat he always carried about him a seal’s skin, by way of preservation.\r\nAnd upon any apprehension of a violent storm, he would retire to some\r\nplace of concealment in a vault under ground; having formerly been\r\nterrified by a flash of lightning, while travelling in the night, as we\r\nhave already mentioned. [241]\r\n\r\nXCI.  He neither slighted his own dreams nor those of other people\r\nrelating to himself.  At the battle of Philippi, although he had resolved\r\nnot to stir out of his tent, on account of his being indisposed, yet,\r\nbeing warned by a dream of one of his friends, he changed his mind; and\r\nwell it was that he did so, for in the enemy’s attack, his couch was\r\npierced and cut to pieces, on the supposition of his being in it.  He had\r\nmany frivolous and frightful dreams during the spring; but in the other\r\nparts of the year, they were less frequent and more significative.  Upon\r\nhis frequently visiting a temple near the Capitol, which he had dedicated\r\nto Jupiter Tonans, he dreamt that Jupiter Capitolinus complained that his\r\nworshippers were taken from him, and that upon this he replied, he had\r\nonly given him The Thunderer for his porter [242].  He therefore\r\nimmediately suspended little bells round the summit of the temple;\r\nbecause such commonly hung at the gates of great houses.  In consequence\r\nof a dream, too, he always, on a certain day of the year, begged alms of\r\nthe people, reaching out his hand to receive the dole which they offered\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nXCII.  Some signs and omens he regarded as infallible.  If in the morning\r\nhis shoe was put on wrong, the left instead of the right, that boded some\r\ndisaster.  If when he commenced a long journey, by sea or land, there\r\nhappened to fall a mizzling rain, he held it to be a good sign of a\r\nspeedy and happy return.  He was much affected likewise with any thing\r\nout of the common course of nature.  A palm-tree [243] which (137)\r\nchanced to grow up between some stone’s in the court of his house, he\r\ntransplanted into a court where the images of the Household Gods were\r\nplaced, and took all possible care to make it thrive in the island of\r\nCapri, some decayed branches of an old ilex, which hung drooping to the\r\nground, recovered themselves upon his arrival; at which he was so\r\ndelighted, that he made an exchange with the Republic [244] of Naples, of\r\nthe island of Oenaria [Ischia], for that of Capri.  He likewise observed\r\ncertain days; as never to go from home the day after the Nundiae [245],\r\nnor to begin any serious business upon the nones [246]; avoiding nothing\r\nelse in it, as he writes to Tiberius, than its unlucky name.\r\n\r\nXCIII.  With regard to the religious ceremonies of foreign nations, he\r\nwas a strict observer of those which had been established by ancient\r\ncustom; but others he held in no esteem.  For, having been initiated at\r\nAthens, and coming afterwards to hear a cause at Rome, relative to the\r\nprivileges of the priests of the Attic Ceres, when some of the mysteries\r\nof their sacred rites were to be introduced in the pleadings, he\r\ndismissed those who sat upon the bench as judges with him, as well as the\r\nby-standers, and beard the argument upon those points himself.  But, on\r\nthe other hand, he not only declined, in his progress through Egypt, to\r\ngo out of his way to pay a visit to Apis, but he likewise commended his\r\ngrandson Caius (138) for not paying his devotions at Jerusalem in his\r\npassage through Judaea. [247]\r\n\r\nXCIV.  Since we are upon this subject, it may not be improper to give an\r\naccount of the omens, before and at his birth, as well as afterwards,\r\nwhich gave hopes of his future greatness, and the good fortune that\r\nconstantly attended him.  A part of the wall of Velletri having in former\r\ntimes been struck with thunder, the response of the soothsayers was, that\r\na native of that town would some time or other arrive at supreme power;\r\nrelying on which prediction, the Velletrians both then, and several times\r\nafterwards, made war upon the Roman people, to their own ruin.  At last\r\nit appeared by the event, that the omen had portended the elevation of\r\nAugustus.\r\n\r\nJulius Marathus informs us, that a few months before his birth, there\r\nhappened at Rome a prodigy, by which was signified that Nature was in\r\ntravail with a king for the Roman people; and that the senate, in alarm,\r\ncame to the resolution that no child born that year should be brought up;\r\nbut that those amongst them, whose wives were pregnant, to secure to\r\nthemselves a chance of that dignity, took care that the decree of the\r\nsenate should not be registered in the treasury.\r\n\r\nI find in the theological books of Asclepiades the Mendesian [248], that\r\nAtia, upon attending at midnight a religious solemnity in honour of\r\nApollo, when the rest of the matrons retired home, fell asleep on her\r\ncouch in the temple, and that a serpent immediately crept to her, and\r\nsoon after withdrew.  She awaking upon it, purified herself, as usual\r\nafter the embraces of her husband; and instantly there appeared upon her\r\nbody a mark in the form of a serpent, which she never after could efface,\r\nand which obliged her, during the subsequent part of her life, to decline\r\nthe use of the public baths.  Augustus, it was added, was born in the\r\ntenth month after, and for that reason was thought to be the son of\r\nApollo.  The (139) same Atia, before her delivery, dreamed that her\r\nbowels stretched to the stars, and expanded through the whole circuit of\r\nheaven and earth.  His father Octavius, likewise, dreamt that a sun-beam\r\nissued from his wife’s womb.\r\n\r\nUpon the day he was born, the senate being engaged in a debate on\r\nCatiline’s conspiracy, and Octavius, in consequence of his wife’s being\r\nin childbirth, coming late into the house, it is a well-known fact, that\r\nPublius Nigidius, upon hearing the occasion of his coming so late, and\r\nthe hour of his wife’s delivery, declared that the world had got a\r\nmaster.  Afterwards, when Octavius, upon marching with his army through\r\nthe deserts of Thrace, consulted the oracle in the grove of father\r\nBacchus, with barbarous rites, concerning his son, he received from the\r\npriests an answer to the same purpose; because, when they poured wine\r\nupon the altar, there burst out so prodigious a flame, that it ascended\r\nabove the roof of the temple, and reached up to the heavens; a\r\ncircumstance which had never happened to any one but Alexander the Great,\r\nupon his sacrificing at the same altars.  And next night he dreamt that\r\nhe saw his son under a more than human appearance, with thunder and a\r\nsceptre, and the other insignia of Jupiter, Optimus, Maximus, having on\r\nhis head a radiant crown, mounted upon a chariot decked with laurel, and\r\ndrawn by six pair of milk-white horses.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was yet an infant, as Caius Drusus relates, being laid in his\r\ncradle by his nurse, and in a low place, the next day he was not to be\r\nfound, and after he had been sought for a long time, he was at last\r\ndiscovered upon a lofty tower, lying with his face towards the rising sun\r\n[249].  When he first began to speak, he ordered the frogs that happened\r\nto make a troublesome noise, upon an estate belonging to the family near\r\nthe town, to be silent; and there goes a report that frogs never croaked\r\nthere since that time.  As he was dining in a grove at the fourth\r\nmile-stone on the Campanian road, an eagle suddenly snatched a piece of\r\nbread out of his hand, and, soaring to a prodigious height, after\r\nhovering, came down most unexpectedly, and returned it to him.\r\n\r\nQuintus Catulus had a dream, for two nights successively after his\r\ndedication of the Capitol.  The first night he dreamt (140) that Jupiter,\r\nout of several boys of the order of the nobility who were playing about\r\nhis altar, selected one, into whose bosom he put the public seal of the\r\ncommonwealth, which he held in his hand; but in his vision the next\r\nnight, he saw in the bosom of Jupiter Capitolinus, the same boy; whom he\r\nordered to be removed, but it was forbidden by the God, who declared that\r\nit must be brought up to become the guardian of the state.  The next day,\r\nmeeting Augustus, with whom till that hour he had not the least\r\nacquaintance, and looking at him with admiration, he said he was\r\nextremely like the boy he had seen in his dream.  Some give a different\r\naccount of Catulus’s first dream, namely, that Jupiter, upon several\r\nnoble lads requesting of him that they might have a guardian, had pointed\r\nto one amongst them, to whom they were to prefer their requests; and\r\nputting his fingers to the boy’s mouth to kiss, he afterwards applied\r\nthem to his own.\r\n\r\nMarcus Cicero, as he was attending Caius Caesar to the Capitol, happened\r\nto be telling some of his friends a dream which he had the preceding\r\nnight, in which he saw a comely youth, let down from heaven by a golden\r\nchain, who stood at the door of the Capitol, and had a whip put into his\r\nhands by Jupiter.  And immediately upon sight of Augustus, who had been\r\nsent for by his uncle Caesar to the sacrifice, and was as yet perfectly\r\nunknown to most of the company, he affirmed that it was the very boy he\r\nhad seen in his dream.  When he assumed the manly toga, his senatorian\r\ntunic becoming loose in the seam on each side, fell at his feet.  Some\r\nwould have this to forbode, that the order, of which that was the badge\r\nof distinction, would some time or other be subject to him.\r\n\r\nJulius Caesar, in cutting down a wood to make room for his camp near\r\nMunda [250], happened to light upon a palm-tree, and ordered it to be\r\npreserved as an omen of victory.  From the root of this tree there put\r\nout immediately a sucker, which, in a few days, grew to such a height as\r\nnot only to equal, but overshadow it, and afford room for many nests of\r\nwild pigeons which built in it, though that species of bird particularly\r\navoids a hard and rough leaf.  It is likewise reported, that Caesar was\r\nchiefly influenced by this prodigy, to prefer his sister’s grandson\r\nbefore all others for his successor.\r\n\r\n(141) In his retirement at Apollonia, he went with his friend Agrippa to\r\nvisit Theogenes, the astrologer, in his gallery on the roof.  Agrippa,\r\nwho first consulted the fates, having great and almost incredible\r\nfortunes predicted of him, Augustus did not choose to make known his\r\nnativity, and persisted for some time in the refusal, from a mixture of\r\nshame and fear, lest his fortunes should be predicted as inferior to\r\nthose of Agrippa.  Being persuaded, however, after much importunity, to\r\ndeclare it, Theogenes started up from his seat, and paid him adoration.\r\nNot long afterwards, Augustus was so confident of the greatness of his\r\ndestiny, that he published his horoscope, and struck a silver coin,\r\nbearing upon it the sign of Capricorn, under the influence of which he\r\nwas born.\r\n\r\nXCV.  After the death of Caesar, upon his return from Apollonia, as he\r\nwas entering the city, on a sudden, in a clear and bright sky, a circle\r\nresembling the rainbow surrounded the body of the sun; and, immediately\r\nafterwards, the tomb of Julia, Caesar’s daughter, was struck by\r\nlightning.  In his first consulship, whilst he was observing the\r\nauguries, twelve vultures presented themselves, as they had done to\r\nRomulus.  And when he offered sacrifice, the livers of all the victims\r\nwere folded inward in the lower part; a circumstance which was regarded\r\nby those present, who had skill in things of that nature, as an\r\nindubitable prognostic of great and wonderful fortune.\r\n\r\nXCVI.  He certainly had a presentiment of the issue of all his wars.\r\nWhen the troops of the Triumviri were collected about Bolognia, an eagle,\r\nwhich sat upon his tent, and was attacked by two crows, beat them both,\r\nand struck them to the ground, in the view of the whole army; who thence\r\ninferred that discord would arise between the three colleagues, which\r\nwould be attended with the like event: and it accordingly happened.  At\r\nPhilippi, he was assured of success by a Thessalian, upon the authority,\r\nas he pretended, of the Divine Caesar himself, who had appeared to him\r\nwhile he was travelling in a bye-road.  At Perugia, the sacrifice not\r\npresenting any favourable intimations, but the contrary, he ordered fresh\r\nvictims; the enemy, however, carrying off the sacred things in a sudden\r\nsally, it was agreed amongst the augurs, that all the (142) dangers and\r\nmisfortunes which had threatened the sacrificer, would fall upon the\r\nheads of those who had got possession of the entrails.  And, accordingly,\r\nso it happened.  The day before the sea-fight near Sicily, as he was\r\nwalking upon the shore, a fish leaped out of the sea, and laid itself at\r\nhis feet.  At Actium, while he was going down to his fleet to engage the\r\nenemy, he was met by an ass with a fellow driving it.  The name of the\r\nman was Eutychus, and that of the animal, Nichon [251].  After the\r\nvictory, he erected a brazen statue to each, in a temple built upon the\r\nspot where he had encamped.\r\n\r\nXCVII.  His death, of which I shall now speak, and his subsequent\r\ndeification, were intimated by divers manifest prodigies.  As he was\r\nfinishing the census amidst a great crowd of people in the Campus\r\nMartius, an eagle hovered round him several times, and then directed its\r\ncourse to a neighbouring temple, where it settled upon the name of\r\nAgrippa, and at the first letter.  Upon observing this, he ordered his\r\ncolleague Tiberius to put up the vows, which it is usual to make on such\r\noccasions, for the succeeding Lustrum.  For he declared he would not\r\nmeddle with what it was probable he should never accomplish, though the\r\ntables were ready drawn for it.  About the same time, the first letter of\r\nhis name, in an inscription upon one of his statues, was struck out by\r\nlightning; which was interpreted as a presage that he would live only a\r\nhundred days longer, the letter C denoting that number; and that he would\r\nbe placed amongst the Gods, as Aesar, which is the remaining part of the\r\nword Caesar, signifies, in the Tuscan language, a God [252].  Being,\r\ntherefore, about dispatching Tiberius to Illyricum, and designing to go\r\nwith him as far as Beneventum, but being detained by several persons who\r\napplied to him respecting causes they had depending, he cried out, (and\r\nit was afterwards regarded as an omen of his death), “Not all the\r\nbusiness in the world, shall detain me at home one moment longer;” and\r\nsetting out upon his journey, he went (143) as far as Astura [253];\r\nwhence, contrary to his custom, he put to sea in the night-time, as there\r\nwas a favourable wind.\r\n\r\nXCVIII.  His malady proceeded from diarrhoea; notwithstanding which, he\r\nwent round the coast of Campania, and the adjacent islands, and spent\r\nfour days in that of Capri; where he gave himself up entirely to repose\r\nand relaxation.  Happening to sail by the bay of Puteoli, the passengers\r\nand mariners aboard a ship of Alexandria [254], just then arrived, clad\r\nall in white, with chaplets upon their heads, and offering incense,\r\nloaded him with praises and joyful acclamations, crying out, “By you we\r\nlive, by you we sail securely, by you enjoy our liberty and our\r\nfortunes.”  At which being greatly pleased, he distributed to each of\r\nthose who attended him, forty gold pieces, requiring from them an\r\nassurance on oath, not to employ the sum given them in any other way,\r\nthan the purchase of Alexandrian merchandize.  And during several days\r\nafterwards, he distributed Togae [255] and Pallia, among other gifts, on\r\ncondition that the Romans should use the Greek, and the Greeks the Roman\r\ndress and language.  He likewise constantly attended to see the boys\r\nperform their exercises, according to an ancient custom still continued\r\nat Capri.  He gave them likewise an entertainment in his presence, and\r\nnot only permitted, but required from them the utmost freedom in jesting,\r\nand scrambling for fruit, victuals, and other things which he threw\r\namongst them.  In a word, he indulged himself in all the ways of\r\namusement he could contrive.\r\n\r\nHe called an island near Capri, Apragopolis, “The City of the\r\nDo-littles,” from the indolent life which several of his party led there.\r\nA favourite of his, one Masgabas [256], he used (144) to call Ktistaes.\r\nas if he had been the planter of the island.  And observing from his room\r\na great company of people with torches, assembled at the tomb of this\r\nMasgabas, who died the year before, he uttered very distinctly this verse,\r\nwhich he made extempore.\r\n\r\n    Ktistou de tumbo, eisoro pyroumenon.\r\n    Blazing with lights I see the founder’s tomb.\r\n\r\nThen turning to Thrasyllus, a companion of Tiberius, who reclined on the\r\nother side of the table, he asked him, who knew nothing about the matter,\r\nwhat poet he thought was the author of that verse; and on his hesitating\r\nto reply, he added another:\r\n\r\n    Oras phaessi Masgaban timomenon.\r\n    Honor’d with torches Masgabas you see;\r\n\r\nand put the same question to him concerning that likewise.  The latter\r\nreplying, that, whoever might be the author, they were excellent verses\r\n[257], he set up a great laugh, and fell into an extraordinary vein of\r\njesting upon it.  Soon afterwards, passing over to Naples, although at\r\nthat time greatly disordered in his bowels by the frequent returns of his\r\ndisease, he sat out the exhibition of the gymnastic games which were\r\nperformed in his honour every five years, and proceeded with Tiberius to\r\nthe place intended.  But on his return, his disorder increasing, he\r\nstopped at Nola, sent for Tiberius back again, and had a long discourse\r\nwith him in private; after which, he gave no further attention to\r\nbusiness of any importance.\r\n\r\nXCIX.  Upon the day of his death, he now and then enquired, if there was\r\nany disturbance in the town on his account; and calling for a mirror, he\r\nordered his hair to be combed, and his shrunk cheeks to be adjusted.\r\nThen asking his friends who were admitted into the room, “Do ye think\r\nthat I have acted my part on the stage of life well?”  he immediately\r\nsubjoined,\r\n\r\n    Ei de pan echei kalos, to paignio\r\n    Dote kroton, kai pantes umeis meta charas ktupaesate.\r\n\r\n    If all be right, with joy your voices raise,\r\n    In loud applauses to the actor’s praise.\r\n\r\n(145) After which, having dismissed them all, whilst he was inquiring of\r\nsome persons who were just arrived from Rome, concerning Drusus’s\r\ndaughter, who was in a bad state of health, he expired suddenly, amidst\r\nthe kisses of Livia, and with these words: “Livia! live mindful of our\r\nunion; and now, farewell!” dying a very easy death, and such as he\r\nhimself had always wished for.  For as often as he heard that any person\r\nhad died quickly and without pain, he wished for himself and his friends\r\nthe like euthanasian (an easy death), for that was the word he made use\r\nof.  He betrayed but one symptom, before he breathed his last, of being\r\ndelirious, which was this: he was all on a sudden much frightened, and\r\ncomplained that he was carried away by forty men.  But this was rather a\r\npresage, than any delirium: for precisely that number of soldiers\r\nbelonging to the pretorian cohort, carried out his corpse.\r\n\r\nC.  He expired in the same room in which his father Octavius had died,\r\nwhen the two Sextus’s, Pompey and Apuleius, were consuls, upon the\r\nfourteenth of the calends of September [the 19th August], at the ninth\r\nhour of the day, being seventy-six years of age, wanting only thirty-five\r\ndays [258].  His remains were carried by the magistrates of the municipal\r\n[259] towns and colonies, from Nola to Bovillae [260], and in the\r\nnighttime, because of the season of the year.  During the intervals, the\r\nbody lay in some basilica, or great temple, of each town.  At Bovillae it\r\nwas met by the Equestrian Order, who carried it to the city, and\r\ndeposited it in the vestibule of his own house.  The senate proceeded\r\nwith so much zeal in the arrangement of his funeral, and paying honour to\r\nhis memory, that, amongst several other proposals, some were for having\r\nthe funeral procession made through the triumphal gate, preceded by the\r\nimage of Victory which is in the senate-house, and the children of\r\nhighest rank and of both sexes singing the funeral (146) dirge.  Others\r\nproposed, that on the day of the funeral, they should lay aside their\r\ngold rings, and wear rings of iron; and others, that his bones should be\r\ncollected by the priests of the principal colleges.  One likewise\r\nproposed to transfer the name of August to September, because he was born\r\nin the latter, but died in the former.  Another moved, that the whole\r\nperiod of time, from his birth to his death, should be called the\r\nAugustan age, and be inserted in the calendar under that title.  But at\r\nlast it was judged proper to be moderate in the honours paid to his\r\nmemory.  Two funeral orations were pronounced in his praise, one before\r\nthe temple of Julius, by Tiberius; and the other before the rostra, under\r\nthe old shops, by Drusus, Tiberius’s son.  The body was then carried upon\r\nthe shoulders of senators into the Campus Martius, and there burnt.  A\r\nman of pretorian rank affirmed upon oath, that he saw his spirit ascend\r\nfrom the funeral pile to heaven.  The most distinguished persons of the\r\nequestrian order, bare-footed, and with their tunics loose, gathered up\r\nhis relics [261], and deposited them in the mausoleum, which had been\r\nbuilt in his sixth consulship between the Flaminian Way and the bank of\r\nthe Tiber [262]; at which time likewise he gave the groves and walks\r\nabout it for the use of the people.\r\n\r\nCI.  He had made a will a year and four months before his death, upon the\r\nthird of the nones of April [the 11th of April], in the consulship of\r\nLucius Plancus, and Caius Silius.  It consisted of two skins of\r\nparchment, written partly in his own hand, and partly by his freedmen\r\nPolybius and Hilarian; and had been committed to the custody of the\r\nVestal Virgins, by whom it was now produced, with three codicils under\r\nseal, as well as the will: all these were opened and read in the senate.\r\nHe appointed as his direct heirs, Tiberius for two (147) thirds of his\r\nestate, and Livia for the other third, both of whom he desired to assume\r\nhis name.  The heirs in remainder were Drusus, Tiberius’s son, for one\r\nthird, and Germanicus with his three sons for the residue.  In the third\r\nplace, failing them, were his relations, and several of his friends.  He\r\nleft in legacies to the Roman people forty millions of sesterces; to the\r\ntribes [263] three millions five hundred thousand; to the pretorian\r\ntroops a thousand each man; to the city cohorts five hundred; and to the\r\nlegions and soldiers three hundred each; which several sums he ordered to\r\nbe paid immediately after his death, having taken due care that the money\r\nshould be ready in his exchequer.  For the rest he ordered different\r\ntimes of payment.  In some of his bequests he went as far as twenty\r\nthousand sesterces, for the payment of which he allowed a twelvemonth;\r\nalleging for this procrastination the scantiness of his estate; and\r\ndeclaring that not more than a hundred and fifty millions of sesterces\r\nwould come to his heirs: notwithstanding that during the twenty preceding\r\nyears, he had received, in legacies from his friends, the sum of fourteen\r\nhundred millions; almost the whole of which, with his two paternal\r\nestates [264], and others which had been left him, he had spent in the\r\nservice of the state.  He left orders that the two Julias, his daughter\r\nand grand-daughter, if anything happened to them, should not be buried in\r\nhis tomb [265].  With regard to the three codicils before-mentioned, in\r\none of them he gave orders about his funeral; another contained a summary\r\nof his acts, which he intended should be inscribed on brazen plates, and\r\nplaced in front of his mausoleum; in the third he had drawn up a concise\r\naccount of the state of the empire; the number of troops enrolled, what\r\nmoney there was in the treasury, the revenue, and arrears of taxes; to\r\nwhich were added the names of the freedmen and slaves from whom the\r\nseveral accounts might be taken.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n(148) OCTAVIUS CAESAR, afterwards Augustus, had now attained to the same\r\nposition in the state which had formerly been occupied by Julius Caesar;\r\nand though he entered upon it by violence, he continued to enjoy it\r\nthrough life with almost uninterrupted tranquillity.  By the long\r\nduration of the late civil war, with its concomitant train of public\r\ncalamities, the minds of men were become less averse to the prospect of\r\nan absolute government; at the same time that the new emperor, naturally\r\nprudent and politic, had learned from the fate of Julius the art of\r\npreserving supreme power, without arrogating to himself any invidious\r\nmark of distinction.  He affected to decline public honours, disclaimed\r\nevery idea of personal superiority, and in all his behaviour displayed a\r\ndegree of moderation which prognosticated the most happy effects, in\r\nrestoring peace and prosperity to the harassed empire.  The tenor of his\r\nfuture conduct was suitable to this auspicious commencement.  While he\r\nendeavoured to conciliate the affections of the people by lending money\r\nto those who stood in need of it, at low interest, or without any at all,\r\nand by the exhibition of public shows, of which the Romans were\r\nremarkably fond; he was attentive to the preservation of a becoming\r\ndignity in the government, and to the correction of morals.  The senate,\r\nwhich, in the time of Sylla, had increased to upwards of four hundred,\r\nand, during the civil war, to a thousand, members, by the admission of\r\nimproper persons, he reduced to six hundred; and being invested with\r\nthe ancient office of censor, which had for some time been disused, he\r\nexercised an arbitrary but legal authority over the conduct of every rank\r\nin the state; by which he could degrade senators and knights, and inflict\r\nupon all citizens an ignominious sentence for any immoral or indecent\r\nbehaviour.  But nothing contributed more to render the new form of\r\ngovernment acceptable to the people, than the frequent distribution of\r\ncorn, and sometimes largesses, amongst the commonalty: for an occasional\r\nscarcity of provisions had always been the chief cause of discontents\r\nand tumults in the capital.  To the interests of the army he likewise\r\npaid particular attention.  It was by the assistance of the legions that\r\nhe had risen to power; and they were the men who, in the last resort,\r\nif such an emergency should ever occur, could alone enable him to\r\npreserve it.\r\n\r\nHistory relates, that after the overthrow of Antony, Augustus held a\r\nconsultation with Agrippa and Mecaenas about restoring the republican\r\nform of government; when Agrippa gave his opinion in favour of that\r\nmeasure, and Mecaenas opposed it.  (149) The object of this consultation,\r\nin respect to its future consequences on society, is perhaps the most\r\nimportant ever agitated in any cabinet, and required, for the mature\r\ndiscussion of it, the whole collective wisdom of the ablest men in the\r\nempire.  But this was a resource which could scarcely be adopted, either\r\nwith security to the public quiet, or with unbiassed judgment in the\r\ndetermination of the question.  The bare agitation of such a point would\r\nhave excited immediate and strong anxiety for its final result; while the\r\nfriends of a republican government, who were still far more numerous than\r\nthose of the other party, would have strained every nerve to procure a\r\ndetermination in their own favour; and the pretorian guards, the surest\r\nprotection of Augustus, finding their situation rendered precarious by\r\nsuch an unexpected occurrence, would have readily listened to the secret\r\npropositions and intrigues of the republicans for securing their\r\nacquiescence to the decision on the popular side.  If, when the subject\r\ncame into debate, Augustus should be sincere in the declaration to abide\r\nby the resolution of the council, it is beyond all doubt, that the\r\nrestoration of a republican government would have been voted by a great\r\nmajority of the assembly.  If, on the contrary, he should not be sincere,\r\nwhich is the more probable supposition, and should incur the suspicion of\r\npractising secretly with members for a decision according to his wish, he\r\nwould have rendered himself obnoxious to the public odium, and given rise\r\nto discontents which might have endangered his future security.\r\n\r\nBut to submit this important question to the free and unbiassed decision\r\nof a numerous assembly, it is probable, neither suited the inclination of\r\nAugustus, nor perhaps, in his opinion, consisted with his personal\r\nsafety.  With a view to the attainment of unconstitutional power, he had\r\nformerly deserted the cause of the republic when its affairs were in a\r\nprosperous situation; and now, when his end was accomplished, there could\r\nbe little ground to expect, that he should voluntarily relinquish the\r\nprize for which he had spilt the best blood of Rome, and contended for so\r\nmany years.  Ever since the final defeat of Antony in the battle of\r\nActium, he had governed the Roman state with uncontrolled authority; and\r\nthough there is in the nature of unlimited power an intoxicating quality,\r\ninjurious both to public and private virtue, yet all history contradicts\r\nthe supposition of its being endued with any which is unpalatable to the\r\ngeneral taste of mankind.\r\n\r\nThere were two chief motives by which Augustus would naturally be\r\ninfluenced in a deliberation on this important subject; namely, the love\r\nof power, and the personal danger which (150) he might incur from\r\nrelinquishing it.  Either of these motives might have been a sufficient\r\ninducement for retaining his authority; but when they both concurred, as\r\nthey seem to have done upon this occasion, their united force was\r\nirresistible.  The argument, so far as relates to the love of power,\r\nrests upon a ground, concerning the solidity of which, little doubt can\r\nbe entertained: but it may be proper to inquire, in a few words, into the\r\nfoundation of that personal danger which he dreaded to incur, on\r\nreturning to the station of a private citizen.\r\n\r\nAugustus, as has been already observed, had formerly sided with the party\r\nwhich had attempted to restore public liberty after the death of Julius\r\nCaesar: but he afterwards abandoned the popular cause, and joined in the\r\nambitious plans of Antony and Lepidus to usurp amongst themselves the\r\nentire dominion of the state.  By this change of conduct, he turned his\r\narms against the supporters of a form of government which he had\r\nvirtually recognized as the legal constitution of Rome; and it involved a\r\ndirect implication of treason against the sacred representatives of that\r\ngovernment, the consuls, formally and duly elected.  Upon such a charge\r\nhe might be amenable to the capital laws of his country.  This, however,\r\nwas a danger which might be fully obviated, by procuring from the senate\r\nand people an act of oblivion, previously to his abdication of the\r\nsupreme power; and this was a preliminary which doubtless they would have\r\nadmitted and ratified with unanimous approbation.  It therefore appears\r\nthat he could be exposed to no inevitable danger on this account: but\r\nthere was another quarter where his person was vulnerable, and where even\r\nthe laws might not be sufficient to protect him against the efforts of\r\nprivate resentment.  The bloody proscription of the Triumvirate no act of\r\namnesty could ever erase from the minds of those who had been deprived by\r\nit of their nearest and dearest relations; and amidst the numerous\r\nconnections of the illustrious men sacrificed on that horrible occasion,\r\nthere might arise some desperate avenger, whose indelible resentment\r\nnothing less would satisfy than the blood of the surviving delinquent.\r\nThough Augustus, therefore, might not, like his great predecessor, be\r\nstabbed in the senate-house, he might perish by the sword or the poniard\r\nin a less conspicuous situation.  After all, there seems to have been\r\nlittle danger from this quarter likewise for Sylla, who in the preceding\r\nage had been guilty of equal enormities, was permitted, on relinquishing\r\nthe place of perpetual dictator, to end his days in quiet retirement; and\r\nthe undisturbed security which Augustus ever afterwards enjoyed, affords\r\nsufficient proof, that all apprehension of danger to his person was\r\nmerely chimerical.\r\n\r\n(151) We have hitherto considered this grand consultation as it might be\r\ninfluenced by the passions or prejudices of the emperor: we shall now\r\ntake a short view of the subject in the light in which it is connected\r\nwith considerations of a political nature, and with public utility.  The\r\narguments handed down by history respecting this consultation are few,\r\nand imperfectly delivered; but they may be extended upon the general\r\nprinciples maintained on each side of the question.\r\n\r\nFor the restoration of the republican government, it might be contended,\r\nthat from the expulsion of the kings to the dictatorship of Julius\r\nCaesar, through a period of upwards of four hundred and sixty years, the\r\nRoman state, with the exception only of a short interval, had flourished\r\nand increased with a degree of prosperity unexampled in the annals of\r\nhumankind: that the republican form of government was not only best\r\nadapted to the improvement of national grandeur, but to the security of\r\ngeneral freedom, the great object of all political association: that\r\npublic virtue, by which alone nations could subsist in vigour, was\r\ncherished and protected by no mode of administration so much as by that\r\nwhich connected, in the strongest bonds of union, the private interests\r\nof individuals with those of the community: that the habits and\r\nprejudices of the Roman people were unalterably attached to the form of\r\ngovernment established by so long a prescription, and they would never\r\nsubmit, for any length of time, to the rule of one person, without making\r\nevery possible effort to recover their liberty: that though despotism,\r\nunder a mild and wise prince, might in some respects be regarded as\r\npreferable to a constitution which was occasionally exposed to the\r\ninconvenience of faction and popular tumults, yet it was a dangerous\r\nexperiment to abandon the government of the nation to the contingency of\r\nsuch a variety of characters as usually occurs in the succession of\r\nprinces; and, upon the whole, that the interests of the people were more\r\nsafely entrusted in the hands of annual magistrates elected by\r\nthemselves, than in those of any individual whose power was permanent,\r\nand subject to no legal control.\r\n\r\nIn favour of despotic government it might be urged, that though Rome had\r\nsubsisted long and gloriously under a republican form of government, yet\r\nshe had often experienced such violent shocks from popular tumults or the\r\nfactions of the great, as had threatened her with imminent destruction:\r\nthat a republican government was only accommodated to a people amongst\r\nwhom the division of property gave to no class of citizens such a degree\r\nof pre-eminence as might prove dangerous to public freedom: that there\r\nwas required in that form of political constitution, a simplicity (152)\r\nof life and strictness of manners which are never observed to accompany a\r\nhigh degree of public prosperity: that in respect of all these\r\nconsiderations, such a form of government was utterly incompatible with\r\nthe present circumstances of the Romans that by the conquest of so many\r\nforeign nations, by the lucrative governments of provinces, the spoils of\r\nthe enemy in war, and the rapine too often practised in time of peace, so\r\ngreat had been the aggrandizement of particular families in the preceding\r\nage, that though the form of the ancient constitution should still remain\r\ninviolate, the people would no longer live under a free republic, but an\r\naristocratical usurpation, which was always productive of tyranny: that\r\nnothing could preserve the commonwealth from becoming a prey to some\r\ndaring confederacy, but the firm and vigorous administration of one\r\nperson, invested with the whole executive power of the state, unlimited\r\nand uncontrolled: in fine, that as Rome had been nursed to maturity by\r\nthe government of six princes successively, so it was only by a similar\r\nform of political constitution that she could now be saved from\r\naristocratical tyranny on one hand, or, on the other, from absolute\r\nanarchy.\r\n\r\nOn whichever side of the question the force of argument may be thought to\r\npreponderate, there is reason to believe that Augustus was guided in his\r\nresolution more by inclination and prejudice than by reason.  It is\r\nrelated, however, that hesitating between the opposite opinions of his\r\ntwo counsellors, he had recourse to that of Virgil, who joined with\r\nMecaenas in advising him to retain the imperial power, as being the form\r\nof government most suitable to the circumstances of the times.\r\n\r\nIt is proper in this place to give some account of the two ministers\r\nabove-mentioned, Agrippa and Mecaenas, who composed the cabinet of\r\nAugustus at the settlement of his government, and seem to be the only\r\npersons employed by him in a ministerial capacity during his whole reign.\r\n\r\nM. Vipsanius Agrippa was of obscure extraction, but rendered himself\r\nconspicuous by his military talents.  He obtained a victory over Sextus\r\nPompey; and in the battles of Philippi and Actium, where he displayed\r\ngreat valour, he contributed not a little to establish the subsequent\r\npower of Augustus.  In his expeditions afterwards into Gaul and Germany,\r\nhe performed many signal achievements, for which he refused the honours\r\nof a triumph.  The expenses which others would have lavished on that\r\nfrivolous spectacle, he applied to the more laudable purpose of\r\nembellishing Rome with magnificent buildings, one of which, the Pantheon,\r\nstill remains.  In consequence of a dispute with Marcellus, the nephew of\r\nAugustus, he retired to Mitylene, (153) whence, after an absence of two\r\nyears, he was recalled by the emperor.  He first married Pomponia, the\r\ndaughter of the celebrated Atticus, and afterwards one of the Marcellas,\r\nthe nieces of Augustus.  While this lady, by whom he had children, was\r\nstill living, the emperor prevailed upon his sister Octavia to resign to\r\nhim her son-in-law, and gave him in marriage his own daughter Julia; so\r\nstrong was the desire of Augustus to be united with him in the closest\r\nalliance.  The high degree of favour in which he stood with the emperor\r\nwas soon after evinced by a farther mark of esteem: for during a visit to\r\nthe Roman provinces of Greece and Asia, in which Augustus was absent two\r\nyears, he left the government of the empire to the care of Agrippa.\r\nWhile this minister enjoyed, and indeed seems to have merited, all the\r\npartiality of Augustus, he was likewise a favourite with the people.  He\r\ndied at Rome, in the sixty-first year of his age, universally lamented;\r\nand his remains were deposited in the tomb which Augustus had prepared\r\nfor himself.  Agrippa left by Julia three sons, Caius, Lucius, and\r\nPosthumus Agrippa, with two daughters, Agrippina and Julia.\r\n\r\nC. Cilnius Mecaenas was of Tuscan extraction, and derived his descent\r\nfrom the ancient kings of that country.  Though in the highest degree of\r\nfavour with Augustus, he never aspired beyond the rank of the equestrian\r\norder; and though he might have held the government of extensive\r\nprovinces by deputies, he was content with enjoying the praefecture of\r\nthe city and Italy; a situation, however, which must have been attended\r\nwith extensive patronage.  He was of a gay and social disposition.  In\r\nprinciple he is said to have been of the Epicurean sect, and in his dress\r\nand manners to have bordered on effeminacy.  With respect to his\r\npolitical talents, we can only speak from conjecture; but from his being\r\nthe confidential minister of a prince of so much discernment as Augustus,\r\nduring the infancy of a new form of government in an extensive empire, we\r\nmay presume that he was endowed with no common abilities for that\r\nimportant station.  The liberal patronage which he displayed towards men\r\nof genius and talents, will render his name for ever celebrated in the\r\nannals of learning.  It is to be regretted that history has transmitted\r\nno particulars of this extraordinary personage, of whom all we know is\r\nderived chiefly from the writings of Virgil and Horace; but from the\r\nmanner in which they address him, amidst the familiarity of their\r\nintercourse, there is the strongest reason to suppose, that he was not\r\nless amiable and respectable in private life, than illustrious in public\r\nsituation.  “O my glory!” is the emphatic expression employed by them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n(154) O decus, O famae merito pars maxima nostrae.   Vir. Georg. ii.\r\n              Light of my life, my glory, and my guide!\r\n          O et praesidium et dulce decus meum.   Hor. Ode I.\r\n              My glory and my patron thou!\r\n\r\nOne would be inclined to think, that there was a nicety in the sense and\r\napplication of the word decus, amongst the Romans, with which we are\r\nunacquainted, and that, in the passages now adduced, it was understood to\r\nrefer to the honour of the emperor’s patronage, obtained through the\r\nmeans of Mecaenas; otherwise, such language to the minister might have\r\nexcited the jealousy of Augustus.  But whatever foundation there may be\r\nfor this conjecture, the compliment was compensated by the superior\r\nadulation which the poets appropriated to the emperor, whose deification\r\nis more than insinuated, in sublime intimations, by Virgil.\r\n\r\n    Tuque adeo quem mox quae sint habitura deorum\r\n    Concilia, incertum est; urbisne invisere, Caesar,\r\n    Terrarumque velis curam; et te maximus orbis\r\n    Auctorem frugum, tempestatumque potentem\r\n    Accipiat, cingens materna tempora myrto:\r\n    An Deus immensi venias maris, ac tua nautae\r\n    Numina sola colant: tibi serviat ultima Thule;\r\n    Teque sibi generum Tethys emat omnibus undis.   Geor. i. 1. 25, vi.\r\n\r\n    Thou Caesar, chief where’er thy voice ordain\r\n    To fix midst gods thy yet unchosen reign--\r\n    Wilt thou o’er cities fix thy guardian sway,\r\n    While earth and all her realms thy nod obey?\r\n    The world’s vast orb shall own thy genial power,\r\n    Giver of fruits, fair sun, and favouring shower;\r\n    Before thy altar grateful nations bow,\r\n    And with maternal myrtle wreathe thy brow;\r\n    O’er boundless ocean shall thy power prevail,\r\n    Thee her sole lord the world of waters hail,\r\n    Rule where the sea remotest Thule laves,\r\n    While Tethys dowers thy bride with all her waves.    Sotheby.\r\n\r\nHorace has elegantly adopted the same strain of compliment.\r\n\r\n    Te multa prece, te prosequitur mero\r\n    Defuso pateris; et Laribus tuum\r\n    Miscet numen, uti Graecia Castoris\r\n        Et magni memor Herculis.    Carm. IV. 5.\r\n\r\n    To thee he chants the sacred song,\r\n      To thee the rich libation pours;\r\n    Thee placed his household gods among,\r\n      With solemn daily prayer adores\r\n    So Castor and great Hercules of old,\r\n    Were with her gods by grateful Greece enrolled.\r\n\r\n(155) The panegyric bestowed upon Augustus by the great poets of that\r\ntime, appears to have had a farther object than the mere gratification of\r\nvanity.  It was the ambition of this emperor to reign in the hearts as\r\nwell as over the persons of his subjects; and with this view he was\r\ndesirous of endearing himself to their imagination.  Both he and Mecaenas\r\nhad a delicate sensibility to the beauties of poetical composition; and\r\njudging from their own feelings, they attached a high degree of influence\r\nto the charms of poetry.  Impressed with these sentiments, it became an\r\nobject of importance, in their opinion, to engage the Muses in the\r\nservice of the imperial authority; on which account, we find Mecaenas\r\ntampering with Propertius, and we may presume, likewise with every other\r\nrising genius in poetry, to undertake an heroic poem, of which Augustus\r\nshould be the hero.  As the application to Propertius cannot have taken\r\nplace until after Augustus had been amply celebrated by the superior\r\nabilities of Virgil and Horace, there seems to be some reason for\r\nascribing Mecaenas’s request to a political motive.  Caius and Lucius,\r\nthe emperor’s grandsons by his daughter Julia, were still living, and\r\nboth young.  As one of them, doubtless, was intended to succeed to the\r\ngovernment of the empire, prudence justified the adoption of every\r\nexpedient that might tend to secure a quiet succession to the heir, upon\r\nthe demise of Augustus.  As a subsidiary resource, therefore, the\r\nexpedient above mentioned was judged highly plausible; and the Roman\r\ncabinet indulged the idea of endeavouring to confirm imperial authority\r\nby the support of poetical renown.  Lampoons against the government were\r\nnot uncommon even in the time of Augustus; and elegant panegyric on the\r\nemperor served to counteract their influence upon the minds of the\r\npeople.  The idea was, perhaps, novel in the time of Augustus; but the\r\nhistory of later ages affords examples of its having been adopted, under\r\ndifferent forms of government, with success.\r\n\r\nThe Roman empire, in the time of Augustus, had attained to a prodigious\r\nmagnitude; and, in his testament, he recommended to his successors never\r\nto exceed the limits which he had prescribed to its extent.  On the East\r\nit stretched to the Euphrates; on the South to the cataracts of the Nile,\r\nthe deserts of Africa, and Mount Atlas; on the West to the Atlantic\r\nOcean; and on the North to the Danube and the Rhine; including the best\r\npart of the then known world.  The Romans, therefore, were not improperly\r\ncalled rerum domini [266], and Rome, pulcherrima rerum [267], maxima\r\nrerum [268].  Even the historians, Livy and Tacitus, (156) actuated\r\nlikewise with admiration, bestow magnificent epithets on the capital of\r\ntheir country.  The succeeding emperors, in conformity to the advice of\r\nAugustus, made few additions to the empire.  Trajan, however, subdued\r\nMesopotamia and Armenia, east of the Euphrates, with Dacia, north of the\r\nDanube; and after this period the Roman dominion was extended over\r\nBritain, as far as the Frith of Forth and the Clyde.\r\n\r\nIt would be an object of curiosity to ascertain the amount of the Roman\r\nrevenue in the reign of Augustus; but such a problem, even with respect\r\nto contemporary nations, cannot be elucidated without access to the\r\npublic registers of their governments; and in regard to an ancient\r\nmonarchy, the investigation is impracticable.  We can only be assured\r\nthat the revenue must have been immense, which arose from the accumulated\r\ncontribution of such a number of nations, that had supported their own\r\ncivil establishments with great splendour, and many of which were\r\ncelebrated for their extraordinary riches and commerce.  The tribute paid\r\nby the Romans themselves, towards the support of the government, was very\r\nconsiderable during the latter ages of the republic, and it received an\r\nincrease after the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa.  The establishments,\r\nboth civil and military, in the different provinces, were supported at\r\ntheir own expense; the emperor required but a small naval force, an arm\r\nwhich adds much to the public expenditure of maritime nations in modern\r\ntimes; and the state was burdened with no diplomatic charges.  The vast\r\ntreasure accruing from the various taxes centered in Rome, and the whole\r\nwas at the disposal of the emperor, without any control.  We may\r\ntherefore justly conclude that, in the amount of taxes, customs, and\r\nevery kind of financial resources, Augustus exceeded all sovereigns who\r\nhad hitherto ever swayed the sceptre of imperial dominion; a noble\r\nacquisition, had it been judiciously employed by his successors, in\r\npromoting public happiness, with half the profusion in which it was\r\nlavished in disgracing human nature, and violating the rights of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Augustus is distinguished by the most extraordinary event\r\nrecorded in history, either sacred or profane, the nativity of the\r\nSaviour of mankind; which has since introduced a new epoch into the\r\nchronology of all Christian nations.  The commencement of the new aera\r\nbeing the most flourishing period of the Roman empire, a general view of\r\nthe state of knowledge and taste at this period, may here not be\r\nimproper.\r\n\r\nCivilization was at this time extended farther over the world than it had\r\never been in any preceding period; but polytheism rather increased than\r\ndiminished with the advancement of commercial (157) intercourse between\r\nthe nations of Europe, Asia, and Africa; and, though philosophy had been\r\ncultivated during several ages, at Athens, Cyrene, Rome, and other seats\r\nof learning, yet the morals of mankind were little improved by the\r\ndiffusion of speculative knowledge.  Socrates had laid an admirable\r\nfoundation for the improvement of human nature, by the exertion of reason\r\nthrough the whole economy of life; but succeeding inquirers, forsaking\r\nthe true path of ethic investigation, deviated into specious discussions,\r\nrather ingenious than useful; and some of them, by gratuitously adopting\r\nprinciples, which, so far from being supported by reason, were repugnant\r\nto its dictates, endeavoured to erect upon the basis of their respective\r\ndoctrines a system peculiar to themselves.  The doctrines of the Stoics\r\nand Epicureans were, in fact, pernicious to society; and those of the\r\ndifferent academies, though more intimately connected with reason than\r\nthe two former, were of a nature too abstract to have any immediate or\r\nuseful influence on life and manners.  General discussions of truth and\r\nprobability, with magnificent declamations on the to kalon, and the\r\nsummum bonum, constituted the chief objects of attention amongst those\r\nwho cultivated moral science in the shades of academical retirement.\r\nCicero endeavoured to bring back philosophy from speculation to practice,\r\nand clearly evinced the social duties to be founded in the unalterable\r\ndictates of virtue; but it was easier to demonstrate the truth of the\r\nprinciples which he maintained, than to enforce their observance, while\r\nthe morals of mankind were little actuated by the exercise of reason\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThe science chiefly cultivated at this period was rhetoric, which appears\r\nto have differed considerably from what now passes under the same name.\r\nThe object of it was not so much justness of sentiment and propriety of\r\nexpression, as the art of declaiming, or speaking copiously upon any\r\nsubject.  It is mentioned by Varro as the reverse of logic; and they are\r\ndistinguished from each other by a simile, that the former resembles the\r\npalm of the hand expanded, and the latter, contracted into the fist.  It\r\nis observable that logic, though a part of education in modern times,\r\nseems not to have been cultivated amongst the Romans.  Perhaps they were\r\napprehensive, lest a science which concentered the force of argument,\r\nmight obstruct the cultivation of that which was meant to dilate it.\r\nAstronomy was long before known in the eastern nations; but there is\r\nreason to believe, from a passage in Virgil [269], that it was little\r\ncultivated by the Romans; and it is certain, that in the reformation of\r\nthe calendar, Julius Caesar was chiefly indebted to the scientific\r\nknowledge of (158) Sosigenes, a mathematician of Alexandria.  The laws of\r\nthe solar system were still but imperfectly known; the popular belief,\r\nthat the sun moved round the earth, was universally maintained, and\r\ncontinued until the sixteenth century, when the contrary was proved by\r\nCopernicus.  There existed many celebrated tracts on mathematics; and\r\nseveral of the mechanical powers, particularly that of the lever, were\r\ncultivated with success.  The more necessary and useful rules of\r\narithmetic were generally known.  The use of the load-stone not being as\r\nyet discovered, navigation was conducted in the day-time by the sun, and\r\nin the night, by the observation of certain stars.  Geography was\r\ncultivated during the present period by Strabo and Mela.  In natural\r\nphilosophy little progress was made; but a strong desire of its\r\nimprovement was entertained, particularly by Virgil.  Human anatomy being\r\nnot yet introduced, physiology was imperfect.  Chemistry, as a science,\r\nwas utterly unknown.  In medicine, the writings of Hippocrates, and other\r\nGreek physicians, were in general the standard of practice; but the\r\nMateria Medica contained few remedies of approved quality, and abounded\r\nwith useless substances, as well as with many which stood upon no other\r\nfoundation than the whimsical notions of those who first introduced them.\r\nArchitecture flourished, through the elegant taste of Vitruvius, and the\r\npatronage of the emperor.  Painting, statuary, and music, were\r\ncultivated, but not with that degree of perfection which they had\r\nobtained in the Grecian states.  The musical instruments of this period\r\nwere the flute and the lyre, to which may be added the sistrum, lately\r\nimported from Egypt.  But the chief glory of the period is its\r\nliterature, of which we proceed to give some account.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the writers of this age, stands the emperor himself, with\r\nhis minister Mecaenas; but the works of both have almost totally\r\nperished.  It appears from the historian now translated, that Augustus\r\nwas the author of several productions in prose, besides some in verse.\r\nHe wrote Answers to Brutus in relation to Cato, Exhortations to\r\nPhilosophy, and the History of his own Life, which he continued, in\r\nthirteen books, down to the war of Cantabria.  A book of his, written in\r\nhexameter verse, under the title of Sicily, was extant in the time of\r\nSuetonius, as was likewise a book of Epigrams.  He began a tragedy on the\r\nsubject of Ajax, but, being dissatisfied with the composition, destroyed\r\nit.  Whatever the merits of Augustus may have been as an author, of which\r\nno judgment can be formed, his attachment to learning and eminent writers\r\naffords a strong presumption that he was not destitute of taste.\r\nMecaenas is said to have written two tragedies, Octavia and Prometheus; a\r\nHistory of (159) Animals; a Treatise on Precious Stones; a Journal of the\r\nLife of Augustus; and other productions.  Curiosity is strongly\r\ninterested to discover the literary talents of a man so much\r\ndistinguished for the esteem and patronage of them in others; but while\r\nwe regret the impossibility of such a development, we scarcely can\r\nsuppose the proficiency to have been small, where the love and admiration\r\nwere so great.\r\n\r\nHistory was cultivated amongst the Romans during the present period, with\r\nuncommon success.  This species of composition is calculated both for\r\ninformation and entertainment; but the chief design of it is to record\r\nall transactions relative to the public, for the purpose of enabling\r\nmankind to draw from past events a probable conjecture concerning the\r\nfuture; and, by knowing the steps which have led either to prosperity or\r\nmisfortune, to ascertain the best means of promoting the former, and\r\navoiding the latter of those objects.  This useful kind of narrative was\r\nintroduced about five hundred years before by Herodotus, who has thence\r\nreceived the appellation of the Father of History.  His style, in\r\nconformity to the habits of thinking, and the simplicity of language, in\r\nan uncultivated age, is plain and unadorned; yet, by the happy modulation\r\nof the Ionic dialect, it gratified the ear, and afforded to the states of\r\nGreece a pleasing mixture of entertainment, enriched not only with\r\nvarious information, often indeed fabulous or unauthentic, but with the\r\nrudiments, indirectly interspersed, of political wisdom.  This writer,\r\nafter a long interval, was succeeded by Thucydides and Xenophon, the\r\nformer of whom carried historical narrative to the highest degree of\r\nimprovement it ever attained among the States of Greece.  The plan of\r\nThucydides seems to have continued to be the model of historical\r\nnarrative to the writers of Rome; but the circumstances of the times,\r\naided perhaps by the splendid exertion of genius in other departments of\r\nliterature, suggested a new resource, which promised not only to animate,\r\nbut embellish the future productions of the historic Muse.  This\r\ninnovation consisted in an attempt to penetrate the human heart, and\r\nexplore in its innermost recesses the sentiments and secret motives which\r\nactuate the conduct of men.  By connecting moral effects with their\r\nprobable internal and external causes, it tended to establish a\r\nsystematic consistency in the concatenation of transactions apparently\r\nanomalous, accidental, or totally independent of each other.\r\n\r\nThe author of this improvement in history was SALLUST, who likewise\r\nintroduced the method of enlivening narrative with the occasional aid of\r\nrhetorical declamation, particularly in his account of the Catilinian\r\nconspiracy.  The notorious (160) characters and motives of the principal\r\npersons concerned in that horrible plot, afforded the most favourable\r\nopportunity for exemplifying the former; while the latter, there is\r\nreason to infer from the facts which must have been at that time publicly\r\nknown, were founded upon documents of unquestionable authority.  Nay, it\r\nis probable that Sallust was present in the senate during the debate\r\nrespecting the punishment of the Catilinian conspirators; his detail of\r\nwhich is agreeable to the characters of the several speakers: but in\r\ndetracting, by invidious silence, or too faint representation, from the\r\nmerits of Cicero on that important occasion, he exhibits a glaring\r\ninstance of the partiality which too often debases the narratives of\r\nthose who record the transactions of their own time.  He had married\r\nTerentia, the divorced wife of Cicero; and there subsisted between the\r\ntwo husbands a kind of rivalship from that cause, to which was probably\r\nadded some degree of animosity, on account of their difference in\r\npolitics, during the late dictatorship of Julius Caesar, by whom Sallust\r\nwas restored to the senate, whence he had been expelled for\r\nlicentiousness, and was appointed governor of Numidia.  Excepting the\r\ninjustice with which Sallust treats Cicero, he is entitled to high\r\ncommendation.  In both his remaining works, the Conspiracy of Catiline,\r\nand the War of Jugurtha, there is a peculiar air of philosophical\r\nsentiment, which, joined to the elegant conciseness of style, and\r\nanimated description of characters, gives to his writings a degree of\r\ninterest, superior to that which is excited in any preceding work of the\r\nhistorical kind.  In the occasional use of obsolete words, and in\r\nlaboured exordiums to both his histories, he is liable to the charge of\r\naffectation; but it is an affectation of language which supports\r\nsolemnity without exciting disgust; and of sentiment which not only\r\nexalts human nature, but animates to virtuous exertions.  It seems to be\r\nthe desire of Sallust to atone for the dissipation of his youth by a\r\ntotal change of conduct; and whoever peruses his exordiums with the\r\nattention which they deserve, must feel a strong persuasion of the\r\njustness of his remarks, if not the incentives of a resolution to be\r\ngoverned by his example.  It seems to be certain, that from the first\r\nmoment of his reformation, he incessantly practised the industry which he\r\nso warmly recommends.  He composed a History of Rome, of which nothing\r\nremains but a few fragments.  Sallust, during his administration of\r\nNumidia, is said to have exercised great oppression.  On his return to\r\nRome he built a magnificent house, and bought delightful gardens, the\r\nname of which, with his own, is to this day perpetuated on the spot which\r\nthey formerly occupied.  Sallust was born at Amiternum, in the country of\r\nthe Sabines, and (161) received his education at Rome.  He incurred great\r\nscandal by an amour with Fausta, the daughter of Sylla, and wife of Milo;\r\nwho detecting the criminal intercourse, is said to have beat him with\r\nstripes, and extorted from him a large sum of money.  He died, according\r\nto tradition, in the fifty-first year of his age.\r\n\r\nCORNELIUS NEPOS was born at Hostilia, near the banks of the Po.  Of his\r\nparentage we meet with no account; but from his respectable connections\r\nearly in life, it is probable that he was of good extraction.  Among his\r\nmost intimate friends were Cicero and Atticus.  Some authors relate that\r\nhe composed three books of Chronicles, with a biographical account of all\r\nthe most celebrated sovereigns, generals, and writers of antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe language of Cornelius Nepos is pure, his style perspicuous, and he\r\nholds a middle and agreeable course between diffuseness and brevity.  He\r\nhas not observed the same rule with respect to the treatment of every\r\nsubject; for the account of some of the lives is so short, that we might\r\nsuspect them to be mutilated, did they not contain evident marks of their\r\nbeing completed in miniature.  The great extent of his plan induced him,\r\nas he informs us, to adopt this expedient.  “Sed plura persequi, tum\r\nmagnitudo voluminis prohibet, tum festinatio, ut ea explicem, quae\r\nexorsus sum.” [270]\r\n\r\nOf his numerous biographical works, twenty-two lives only remain, which\r\nare all of Greeks, except two Carthaginians, Hamilcar and Hannibal; and\r\ntwo Romans, M. Porcius Cato and T. Pomponius Atticus.  Of his own\r\nlife,--of him who had written the lives of so many, no account is\r\ntransmitted; but from the multiplicity of his productions, we may\r\nconclude that it was devoted to literature.\r\n\r\nTITUS LIVIUS may be ranked among the most celebrated historians the world\r\nhas ever produced.  He composed a history of Rome from the foundation of\r\nthe city, to the conclusion of the German war conducted by Drusus in the\r\ntime of the emperor Augustus.  This great work consisted, originally, of\r\none hundred and forty books; of which there now remain only thirty-five,\r\nviz., the first decade, and the whole from book twenty-one to book\r\nforty-five, both inclusive.  Of the other hundred and five books, nothing\r\nmore has survived the ravages of time and barbarians than their general\r\ncontents.  In a perspicuous arrangement of his subject, in a full and\r\ncircumstantial account of transactions, in the delineation of characters\r\nand other objects of description, to justness and aptitude of sentiment,\r\nand in an air of majesty (162) pervading the whole composition, this\r\nauthor may be regarded as one of the best models extant of historical\r\nnarrative.  His style is splendid without meretricious ornament, and\r\ncopious without being redundant; a fluency to which Quintilian gives the\r\nexpressive appellation of “lactea ubertas.”  Amongst the beauties which\r\nwe admire in his writings, besides the animated speeches frequently\r\ninterspersed, are those concise and peculiarly applicable eulogiums, with\r\nwhich he characterises every eminent person mentioned, at the close of\r\ntheir life.  Of his industry in collating, and his judgment in deciding\r\nupon the preference due to, dissentient authorities, in matters of\r\ntestimony, the work affords numberless proofs.  Of the freedom and\r\nimpartiality with which he treated even of the recent periods of history,\r\nthere cannot be more convincing evidence, than that he was rallied by\r\nAugustus as a favourer of Pompey; and that, under the same emperor, he\r\nnot only bestowed upon Cicero the tribute of warm approbation, but dared\r\nto ascribe, in an age when their names were obnoxious, even to Brutus and\r\nCassius the virtues of consistency and patriotism.  If in any thing the\r\nconduct of Livy violates our sentiments of historical dignity, it is the\r\napparent complacency and reverence with which he every where mentions the\r\npopular belief in omens and prodigies; but this was the general\r\nsuperstition of the times; and totally to renounce the prejudices of\r\nsuperstitious education, is the last heroic sacrifice to philosophical\r\nscepticism.  In general, however, the credulity of Livy appears to be\r\nrather affected than real; and his account of the exit of Romulus, in the\r\nfollowing passage, may be adduced as an instance in confirmation of this\r\nremark.\r\n\r\n“His immortalibus editis operibus, quum ad exercitum recensendum\r\nconcionem in campo ad Caprae paludem haberet, subita coorta tempestate\r\ncum magno fragore tonitribusque tam denso regem operuit nimbo, ut\r\nconspectum ejus concioni abstulerit; nec deinde in terris Romulus fuit.\r\nRomana pubes, sedato tandem pavore, postquam ex tam turbido die serena,\r\net tranquilla lux rediit, ubi vacuam sedem regiam vidit; etsi satis\r\ncredebat Patribus, qui proximi steterant, sublimem raptum procella; tamen\r\nveluti orbitatis metu icta, maestum aliquamdiu silentium obtinuit.\r\nDeinde a paucis initio facto, Deum, Deo natum, regem parentemque urbis\r\nRomanae, salvere universi Romulum jubent; pacem precibus exposcunt, uti\r\nvolens propitius suam semper sospitet progeniem.  Fuisse credo tum quoque\r\naliquos, qui discerptum regem Patrum manibus taciti arguerent; manavit\r\nenim haec quoque, et perobscura, fama.  Illam alteram admiratio viri, et\r\npavor praesens nobilitavit.  Consilio etiam unius hominis addita rei\r\ndicitur fides; namque Proculus Julius sollicita civitate desiderio (163)\r\nregis, et infensa Patribus, gravis, ut traditur, quamvis magnae rei\r\nauctor, in concionem prodit.  ‘Romulus, inquit, Quirites, parens urbis\r\nhujus, prima hodierna luce coelo repente delapsus, se mihi obvium dedit;\r\nquam profusus horrore venerabundusque astitissem, petens precibus, ut\r\ncontra intueri fas esset; Abi, nuncia, inquit, Romanis, Coelestes ita\r\nvelle, ut mea Roma caput orbis terrarum sit; proinde rem militarem\r\ncolant; sciantque, et ita posteris tradant, nullas opes humanas armis\r\nRomanis resistere posse.’  Haec, inquit, locutus, sublimis abiit.  Mirum,\r\nquantum illi viro nuncianti haec fidei fuerit; quamque desiderium Romuli\r\napud plebem exercitumque, facta fide immortalitatis, lenitum sit.” [271]\r\n\r\nScarcely any incident in ancient history savours more of the (164)\r\nmarvellous than the account above delivered respecting the first Roman\r\nking; and amidst all the solemnity with which it is related, we may\r\nperceive that the historian was not the dupe of credulity.  There is more\r\nimplied than the author thought proper to avow, in the sentence, Fuisse\r\ncredo, etc.  In whatever light this anecdote be viewed, it is involved in\r\nperplexity.  That Romulus affected a despotic power, is not only highly\r\nprobable, from his aspiring disposition, but seems to be confirmed by his\r\nrecent appointment of the Celeres, as a guard to his person.  He might,\r\ntherefore, naturally incur the odium of the patricians, whose importance\r\nwas diminished, and their institution rendered abortive, by the increase\r\nof his power.  But that they should choose the opportunity of a military\r\nreview, for the purpose of removing the tyrant by a violent death, seems\r\nnot very consistent with the dictates even of common prudence; and it is\r\nthe more incredible, as the circumstance which favoured the execution of\r\nthe plot is represented to have been entirely a fortuitous occurrence.\r\nThe tempest which is said to have happened, is not easily reconcilable\r\nwith our knowledge of that phenomenon.  Such a cloud, or mist, as could\r\nhave enveloped Romulus from the eyes of the assembly, is not a natural\r\nconcomitant of a thunder-storm.  There is some reason to suspect that\r\nboth the noise and cloud, if they actually existed, were artificial; the\r\nformer intended to divert the attention of the spectators, and the latter\r\nto conceal the transaction.  The word fragor, a noise or crash, appears\r\nto be an unnecessary addition where thunder is expressed, though\r\nsometimes so used by the poets, and may therefore, perhaps, imply such a\r\nnoise from some other cause.  If Romulus was killed by any pointed or\r\nsharp-edged weapon, his blood might have been discovered on the spot; or,\r\nif by other means, still the body was equally an object for public\r\nobservation.  If the people suspected the patricians to be guilty of\r\nmurder, why did they not endeavour to trace the fact by this evidence?\r\nAnd if the patricians were really innocent, why did they not urge the\r\nexamination?  But the body, without doubt, was secreted, to favour the\r\nimposture.  The whole narrative is strongly marked with circumstances\r\ncalculated to affect credulity with ideas of national importance; and, to\r\ncountenance the design, there is evidently a chasm in the Roman history\r\nimmediately preceding this transaction and intimately connected with it.\r\n\r\nLivy was born at Patavium [272], and has been charged by Asinius Pollio\r\nand others with the provincial dialect of his country.  The objections to\r\nhis Pativinity, as it is called, relate chiefly to the (165) spelling of\r\nsome words; in which, however, there seems to be nothing so peculiar, as\r\neither to occasion any obscurity or merit reprehension.\r\n\r\nLivy and Sallust being the only two existing rivals in Roman history, it\r\nmay not be improper to draw a short comparison between them, in respect\r\nof their principal qualities, as writers.  With regard to language, there\r\nis less apparent affectation in Livy than in Sallust.  The narrative of\r\nboth is distinguished by an elevation of style: the elevation of Sallust\r\nseems to be often supported by the dignity of assumed virtue; that of\r\nLivy by a majestic air of historical, and sometimes national, importance.\r\nIn delineating characters, Sallust infuses more expression, and Livy more\r\nfulness, into the features.  In the speeches ascribed to particular\r\npersons, these writers are equally elegant and animated.\r\n\r\nSo great was the fame of Livy in his own life-time, that people came from\r\nthe extremity of Spain and Gaul, for the purpose only of beholding so\r\ncelebrated a historian, who was regarded, for his abilities, as a\r\nprodigy.  This affords a strong proof, not only of the literary taste\r\nwhich then prevailed over the most extensive of the Roman provinces, but\r\nof the extraordinary pains with which so great a work must have been\r\npropagated, when the art of printing was unknown.  In the fifteenth\r\ncentury, on the revival of learning in Europe, the name of this great\r\nwriter recovered its ancient veneration; and Alphonso of Arragon, with a\r\nsuperstition characteristic of that age, requested of the people of\r\nPadua, where Livy was born, and is said to have been buried, to be\r\nfavoured by them with the hand which had written so admirable a work.--\r\n\r\nThe celebrity of VIRGIL has proved the means of ascertaining his birth\r\nwith more exactness than is common in the biographical memoirs of ancient\r\nwriters.  He was born at Andes, a village in the neighbourhood of Mantua,\r\non the 15th of October, seventy years before the Christian aera.  His\r\nparents were of moderate condition; but by their industry acquired some\r\nterritorial possessions, which descended to their son.  The first seven\r\nyears of his life was spent at Cremona, whence he went to Mediolanum, now\r\nMilan, at that time the seat of the liberal arts, denominated, as we\r\nlearn from Pliny the younger, Novae Athenae.  From this place he\r\nafterwards moved to Naples, where he applied himself with great assiduity\r\nto Greek and Roman literature, particularly to the physical and\r\nmathematical sciences; for which he expressed a strong predilection in\r\nthe second book of his Georgics.\r\n\r\n    Me vero primum dulces ante omnia Musae,\r\n    Quarum sacra fero ingenti perculsus amore,\r\n    (166) Accipiant; coelique vias et sidera monstrent;\r\n    Defectus Solis varios, Lunaeque labores:\r\n    Unde tremor terris: qua vi maria alta tumescant\r\n    Obicibus ruptis, rursusque in seipsa residant:\r\n    Quid tantum Oceano properent se tingere soles\r\n    Hiberni: vel quae tardis mora noctibus obstet.\r\n                                            Geor. ii. 1. 591, etc.\r\n\r\n    But most beloved, ye Muses, at whose fane,\r\n    Led by pure zeal, I consecrate my strain,\r\n    Me first accept!  And to my search unfold,\r\n    Heaven and her host in beauteous order rolled,\r\n    The eclipse that dims the golden orb of day,\r\n    And changeful labour of the lunar ray;\r\n    Whence rocks the earth, by what vast force the main\r\n    Now bursts its barriers, now subsides again;\r\n    Why wintry suns in ocean swiftly fade,\r\n    Or what delays night’s slow-descending shade.    Sotheby.\r\n\r\nWhen, by a proscription of the Triumvirate, the lands of Cremona and\r\nMantua were distributed amongst the veteran soldiers, Virgil had the good\r\nfortune to recover his possessions, through the favour of Asinius Pollio,\r\nthe deputy of Augustus in those parts; to whom, as well as to the\r\nemperor, he has testified his gratitude in beautiful eclogues.\r\n\r\nThe first production of Virgil was his Bucolics, consisting of ten\r\neclogues, written in imitation of the Idyllia or pastoral poems of\r\nTheocritus.  It may be questioned whether any language which has its\r\nprovincial dialects, but is brought to perfection, can ever be well\r\nadapted, in that state, to the use of pastoral poetry.  There is such an\r\napparent incongruity between the simple ideas of the rural swain and the\r\npolished language of the courtier, that it seems impossible to reconcile\r\nthem together by the utmost art of composition.  The Doric dialect of\r\nTheocritus, therefore, abstractedly from all consideration of simplicity\r\nof sentiment, must ever give to the Sicilian bard a pre-eminence in this\r\nspecies of poetry.  The greater part of the Bucolics of Virgil may be\r\nregarded as poems of a peculiar nature, into which the author has happily\r\ntransfused, in elegant versification, the native manners and ideas,\r\nwithout any mixture of the rusticity of pastoral life.  With respect to\r\nthe fourth eclogue, addressed to Pollio, it is avowedly of a nature\r\nsuperior to that of pastoral subjects:\r\n\r\n    Sicelides Musae, paullo majora canamus.\r\n    Sicilian Muse, be ours a loftier strain.\r\n\r\nVirgil engaged in bucolic poetry at the request of Asinius Pollio, whom\r\nhe highly esteemed, and for one of whose sons in particular, (167) with\r\nCornelius Gallus, a poet likewise, he entertained the warmest affection.\r\nHe has celebrated them all in these poems, which were begun, we are told,\r\nin the twenty-ninth year of his age, and completed in three years.  They\r\nwere held in so great esteem amongst the Romans, immediately after their\r\npublication, that it is said they were frequently recited upon the stage\r\nfor the entertainment of the audience.  Cicero, upon hearing some lines\r\nof them, perceived that they were written in no common strain of poetry,\r\nand desired that the whole eclogue might be recited: which being done, he\r\nexclaimed, “Magnae spes altera Romae.”  Another hope of mighty Rome!\r\n[273]\r\n\r\nVirgil’s next work was the Georgics, the idea of which is taken from the\r\nErga kai Hmerai, the Works and Days of Hesiod, the poet of Ascra.  But\r\nbetween the productions of the two poets, there is no other similarity\r\nthan that of their common subject.  The precepts of Hesiod, in respect of\r\nagriculture, are delivered with all the simplicity of an unlettered\r\ncultivator of the fields, intermixed with plain moral reflections,\r\nnatural and apposite; while those of Virgil, equally precise and\r\nimportant, are embellished with all the dignity of sublime versification.\r\nThe work is addressed to Mecaenas, at whose request it appears to have\r\nbeen undertaken.  It is divided into four books.  The first treats of\r\nploughing; the second, of planting; the third, of cattle, horses, sheep,\r\ngoats, dogs, and of things which are hurtful to cattle; the fourth is\r\nemployed on bees, their proper habitations, food, polity, the diseases to\r\nwhich they are liable, and the remedies of them, with the method of\r\nmaking honey, and a variety of other considerations connected with the\r\nsubject.  The Georgics (168) were written at Naples, and employed the\r\nauthor during a period of seven years.  It is said that Virgil had\r\nconcluded the Georgics with a laboured eulogium on his poetical friend\r\nGallus; but the latter incurring about this time the displeasure of\r\nAugustus, he was induced to cancel it, and substitute the charming\r\nepisode of Astaeus and Eurydice.\r\n\r\nThese beautiful poems, considered merely as didactic, have the justest\r\nclaim to utility.  In what relates to agriculture in particular, the\r\nprecepts were judiciously adapted to the climate of Italy, and must have\r\nconveyed much valuable information to those who were desirous of\r\ncultivating that important art, which was held in great honour amongst\r\nthe Romans.  The same remark may be made, with greater latitude of\r\napplication, in respect of the other subjects.  But when we examine the\r\nGeorgics as poetical compositions, when we attend to the elevated style\r\nin which they are written, the beauty of the similes, the emphatic\r\nsentiments interspersed, the elegance of diction, the animated strain of\r\nthe whole, and the harmony of the versification, our admiration is\r\nexcited, at beholding subjects, so common in their nature, embellished\r\nwith the most magnificent decorations of poetry.\r\n\r\nDuring four days which Augustus passed at Atella, to refresh himself from\r\nfatigue, in his return to Rome, after the battle of Actium, the Georgics,\r\njust then finished, were read to him by the author, who was occasionally\r\nrelieved in the task by his friend Mecaenas.  We may easily conceive the\r\nsatisfaction enjoyed by the emperor, at finding that while he himself had\r\nbeen gathering laurels in the achievements of war, another glorious\r\nwreath was prepared by the Muses to adorn his temples; and that an\r\nintimation was given of his being afterwards celebrated in a work more\r\ncongenial to the subject of heroic renown.\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that the Aeneid was written at the particular\r\ndesire of Augustus, who was ambitious of having the Julian family\r\nrepresented as lineal descendants of the Trojan Aeneas.  In this\r\ncelebrated poem, Virgil has happily united the characteristics of the\r\nIliad and Odyssey, and blended them so judiciously together, that they\r\nmutually contribute to the general effect of the whole.  By the esteem\r\nand sympathy excited for the filial piety and misfortunes of Aeneas at\r\nthe catastrophe of Troy, the reader is strongly interested in his\r\nsubsequent adventures; and every obstacle to the establishment of the\r\nTrojans in the promised land of Hesperia produces fresh sensations of\r\nincreased admiration and attachment.  The episodes, characters, and\r\nincidents, all concur to give beauty or grandeur to the poem.  The\r\npicture of Troy in flames can never be sufficiently (169) admired!  The\r\nincomparable portrait of Priam, in Homer, is admirably accommodated to a\r\ndifferent situation, in the character of Anchises, in the Aeneid.  The\r\nprophetic rage of the Cumaean Sibyl displays in the strongest colours the\r\nenthusiasm of the poet.  For sentiment, passion, and interesting\r\ndescription, the episode of Dido is a master-piece in poetry.  But Virgil\r\nis not more conspicuous for strength of description than propriety of\r\nsentiment; and wherever he takes a hint from the Grecian bard, he\r\nprosecutes the idea with a judgment peculiar to himself.  It may be\r\nsufficient to mention one instance.  In the sixth book of the Iliad,\r\nwhile the Greeks are making great slaughter amongst the Trojans, Hector,\r\nby the advice of Helenus, retires into the city, to desire that his\r\nmother would offer up prayers to the goddess Pallas, and vow to her a\r\nnoble sacrifice, if she would drive Diomede from the walls of Troy.\r\nImmediately before his return to the field of battle, he has his last\r\ninterview with Andromache, whom he meets with his infant son Astyanax,\r\ncarried by a nurse.  There occurs, upon this occasion, one of the most\r\nbeautiful scenes in the Iliad, where Hector dandles the boy in his arms,\r\nand pours forth a prayer, that he may one day be superior in fame to his\r\nfather.  In the same manner, Aeneas, having armed himself for the\r\ndecisive combat with Turnus, addresses his son Ascanius in a beautiful\r\nspeech, which, while expressive of the strongest paternal affection,\r\ncontains, instead of a prayer, a noble and emphatic admonition, suitable\r\nto a youth who had nearly attained the period of adult age.  It is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Disce, puer, virtutem ex me, verumque laborem;\r\n    Fortunam ex aliis; nunc te mea dextera bello\r\n    Defensum dabit, et magna inter praemia ducet.\r\n    Tu facito, mox cum matura adoleverit aetas,\r\n    Sis memor: et te animo repetentem exempla tuorum,\r\n    Et pater Aeneas, et avunculus excitet Hector.--Aeneid, xii.\r\n\r\n    My son! from my example learn the war\r\n    In camps to suffer, and in feuds to dare,\r\n    But happier chance than mine attend thy care!\r\n    This day my hand thy tender age shall shield,\r\n    And crown with honours of the conquered field:\r\n    Thou when thy riper years shall send thee forth\r\n    To toils of war, be mindful of my worth;\r\n    Assert thy birthright, and in arms be known,\r\n    For Hector’s nephew and Aeneas’ son.\r\n\r\nVirgil, though born to shine by his own intrinsic powers, certainly owed\r\nmuch of his excellence to the wonderful merits of Homer.  His susceptible\r\nimagination, vivid and correct, was (170) impregnated by the Odyssey, and\r\nwarmed with the fire of the Iliad.  Rivalling, or rather on some\r\noccasions surpassing his glorious predecessor in the characters of heroes\r\nand of gods, he sustains their dignity with so uniform a lustre, that\r\nthey seem indeed more than mortal.\r\n\r\nWhether the Iliad or the Aeneid be the more perfect composition, is a\r\nquestion which has often been agitated, but perhaps will never be\r\ndetermined to general satisfaction.  In comparing the genius of the two\r\npoets, however, allowance ought to be made for the difference of\r\ncircumstances under which they composed their respective works.  Homer\r\nwrote in an age when mankind had not as yet made any great progress in\r\nthe exertion of either intellect or imagination, and he was therefore\r\nindebted for big resources to the vast capacity of his own mind.  To this\r\nwe must add, that he composed both his poems in a situation of life\r\nextremely unfavourable to the cultivation of poetry.  Virgil, on the\r\ncontrary, lived at a period when literature had attained to a high state\r\nof improvement.  He had likewise not only the advantage of finding a\r\nmodel in the works of Homer, but of perusing the laws of epic poetry,\r\nwhich had been digested by Aristotle, and the various observations made\r\non the writings of the Greek bard by critics of acuteness and taste;\r\namongst the chief of whom was his friend Horace, who remarks that\r\n\r\n    --------quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus.--De Arte Poet.\r\n\r\n            E’en sometimes the good Homer naps.\r\n\r\nVirgil, besides, composed his poem in a state remote from indigence,\r\nwhere he was roused to exertion by the example of several contemporary\r\npoets; and what must have animated him beyond every other consideration,\r\nhe wrote both at the desire, and under the patronage of the emperor and\r\nhis minister Mecaenas.  In what time Homer composed either of his poems,\r\nwe know not; but the Aeneid, we are informed, was the employment of\r\nVirgil during eleven years.  For some years, the repeated entreaties of\r\nAugustus could not extort from him the smallest specimen of the work; but\r\nat length, when considerably advanced in it, he condescended to recite\r\nthree books--the second, the fourth, and the sixth--in the presence of\r\nthe emperor and his sister Octavia, to gratify the latter of whom, in\r\nparticular, the recital of the last book now mentioned, was intended.\r\nWhen the poet came to the words, Tu Marcellus eris, alluding to Octavia’s\r\nson, a youth of great hopes, who had lately died, the mother fainted.\r\nAfter she had recovered from this fit, by the care of her attendants, she\r\nordered ten sesterces to be given to Virgil for every line relating (171)\r\nto that subject; a gratuity which amounted to about two thousand pounds\r\nsterling.\r\n\r\nIn the composition of the Aeneid, Virgil scrupled not to introduce whole\r\nlines of Homer, and of the Latin poet Ennius; many of whose sentences he\r\nadmired.  In a few instances he has borrowed from Lucretius.  He is said\r\nto have been at extraordinary pains in polishing his numbers; and when he\r\nwas doubtful of any passage, he would read it to some of his friends,\r\nthat he might have their opinion.  On such occasions, it was usual with\r\nhim to consult in particular his freedman and librarian Erotes, an old\r\ndomestic, who, it is related, supplied extempore a deficiency in two\r\nlines, and was desired by his master to write them in the manuscript.\r\n\r\nWhen this immortal work was completed, Virgil resolved on retiring into\r\nGreece and Asia for three years, that he might devote himself entirely to\r\npolishing it, and have leisure afterwards to pass the remainder of his\r\nlife in the cultivation of philosophy.  But meeting at Athens with\r\nAugustus, who was on his return from the East, he determined on\r\naccompanying the emperor back to Rome.  Upon a visit to Megara, a town in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Athens, he was seized with a languor, which\r\nincreased during the ensuing voyage; and he expired a few days after\r\nlanding at Brundisium, on the 22nd of September, in the fifty-second year\r\nof his age.  He desired that his body might be carried to Naples, where\r\nhe had passed many happy years; and that the following distich, written\r\nin his last sickness, should be inscribed upon his tomb:\r\n\r\n    Mantua me genuit: Calabri rapuere: tenet nunc\r\n      Parthenope: cecini pascua, rura, duces. [274]\r\n\r\nHe was accordingly interred, by the order of Augustus, with great funeral\r\npomp, within two miles of Naples, near the road to Puteoli, where his\r\ntomb still exists.  Of his estate, which was very considerable by the\r\nliberality of his friends, he left the greater part to Valerius Proculus\r\nand his brother, a fourth to Augustus, a twelfth to Mecaenas, besides\r\nlegacies to L. Varius and Plotius Tucca, who, in consequence of his own\r\nrequest, and the command of Augustus, revised and corrected the Aeneid\r\nafter his death.  Their instructions from the emperor were, to expunge\r\nwhatever they thought improper, but upon no account to make any addition.\r\nThis restriction is supposed to be the cause that many lines in the\r\nAeneid are imperfect.\r\n\r\nVirgil was of large stature, had a dark complexion, and his (172)\r\nfeatures are said to have been such as expressed no uncommon abilities.\r\nHe was subject to complaints of the stomach and throat, as well as to\r\nhead-ache, and had frequent discharges of blood upwards: but from what\r\npart, we are not informed.  He was very temperate both in food and wine.\r\nHis modesty was so great, that at Naples they commonly gave him the name\r\nof Parthenias, “the modest man.”  On the subject of his modesty; the\r\nfollowing anecdote is related.\r\n\r\nHaving written a distich, in which he compared Augustus to Jupiter, he\r\nplaced it in the night-time over the gate of the emperor’s palace.  It\r\nwas in these words:\r\n\r\n    Nocte pluit tota, redeunt spectacula mane:\r\n      Divisum imperium cum Jove Caesar habet.\r\n\r\n    All night it rained, with morn the sports appear,\r\n    Caesar and Jove between them rule the year.\r\n\r\nBy order of Augustus, an inquiry was made after the author; and Virgil\r\nnot declaring himself, the verses were claimed by Bathyllus, a\r\ncontemptible poet, but who was liberally rewarded on the occasion.\r\nVirgil, provoked at the falsehood of the impostor, again wrote the verses\r\non some conspicuous part of the palace, and under them the following\r\nline:\r\n\r\n    Hos ego versiculos feci, tulit alter honorem;\r\n    I wrote the verse, another filched the praise;\r\n\r\nwith the beginning of another line in these words:\r\n\r\n    Sic vos, non vobis,\r\n    Not for yourselves, you----\r\n\r\nrepeated four times.  Augustus expressing a desire that the lines should\r\nbe finished, and Bathyllus proving unequal to the task, Virgil at last\r\nfilled up the blanks in this manner:\r\n\r\n    Sic vos, non vobis, nidificatis, aves;\r\n    Sic vos, non vobis, vellera fertis, oves;\r\n    Sic vos, non vobis, mellificatis, apes;\r\n    Sic vos, non vobis, fertis aratra, boves.\r\n\r\n    Not for yourselves, ye birds, your nests ye build;\r\n    Not for yourselves, ye sheep, your fleece ye yield;\r\n    Not for yourselves, ye bees, your cells ye fill;\r\n    Not for yourselves, ye beeves, ye plough and till.\r\n\r\nThe expedient immediately evinced him to be the author of the distich,\r\nand Bathyllus became the theme of public ridicule.\r\n\r\nWhen at any time Virgil came to Rome, if the people, as was commonly the\r\ncase, crowded to gaze upon him, or pointed at him with the finger in\r\nadmiration, he blushed, and stole away (173) from them; frequently taking\r\nrefuge in some shop.  When he went to the theatre, the audience\r\nuniversally rose up at his entrance, as they did to Augustus, and\r\nreceived him with the loudest plaudits; a compliment which, however\r\nhighly honourable, he would gladly have declined.  When such was the just\r\nrespect which they paid to the author of the Bucolics and Georgics, how\r\nwould they have expressed their esteem, had they beheld him in the\r\neffulgence of epic renown!  In the beautiful episode of the Elysian\r\nfields, in the Aeneid, where he dexterously introduced a glorious display\r\nof their country, he had touched the most elastic springs of Roman\r\nenthusiasm.  The passion would have rebounded upon himself, and they\r\nwould, in the heat of admiration, have idolized him.\r\n\r\nHORACE was born at Venusia, on the tenth of December, in the consulship\r\nof L. Cotta and L. Torquatus.  According to his own acknowledgment, his\r\nfather was a freedman; by some it is said that he was a collector of the\r\nrevenue, and by others, a fishmonger, or a dealer in salted meat.\r\nWhatever he was, he paid particular attention to the education of his\r\nson, for, after receiving instruction from the best masters in Rome, he\r\nsent him to Athens to study philosophy.  From this place, Horace followed\r\nBrutus, in the quality of a military tribune, to the battle of Philippi,\r\nwhere, by his own confession, being seized with timidity, he abandoned\r\nthe profession of a soldier, and returning to Rome, applied himself to\r\nthe cultivation of poetry.  In a short time he acquired the friendship of\r\nVirgil and Valerius, whom he mentions in his Satires, in terms of the\r\nmost tender affection.\r\n\r\n    Postera lux oritur multo gratissima: namque\r\n    Plotius et Varius Sinuessae, Virgiliusque,\r\n    Occurrunt; animae, quales neque candidiores\r\n    Terra tulit, neque queis me sit devinctior alter.\r\n    O qui complexus, et gaudia quanta fuerunt!\r\n    Nil ego contulerim jucundo sanus amico.--Sat. I. 5.\r\n\r\n    Next rising morn with double joy we greet,\r\n    For Plotius, Varius, Virgil, here we meet:\r\n    Pure spirits these; the world no purer knows,\r\n    For none my heart with more affection glows:\r\n    How oft did we embrace, our joys how great!\r\n    For sure no blessing in the power of fate\r\n    Can be compared, in sanity of mind,\r\n    To friends of such companionable kind.--Francis.\r\n\r\nBy the two friends above mentioned, he was recommended to the patronage\r\nnot only of Mecaenas, but of Augustus, with whom he, as well as Virgil,\r\nlived on a footing of the greatest intimacy.  Satisfied with the luxury\r\nwhich he enjoyed at the first tables in (174) Rome, he was so unambitious\r\nof any public employment, that when the emperor offered him the place of\r\nhis secretary, he declined it.  But as he lived in an elegant manner,\r\nhaving, besides his house in town, a cottage on his Sabine farm, and a\r\nvilla at Tibur, near the falls of the Anio, he enjoyed, beyond all doubt.\r\na handsome establishment, from the liberality of Augustus.  He indulged\r\nhimself in indolence and social pleasure, but was at the same time much\r\ndevoted to reading; and enjoyed a tolerable good state of health,\r\nalthough often incommoded with a fluxion of rheum upon the eyes.\r\n\r\nHorace, in the ardour of youth, and when his bosom beat high with the\r\nraptures of fancy, had, in the pursuit of Grecian literature, drunk\r\nlargely, at the source, of the delicious springs of Castalia; and it\r\nseems to have been ever after his chief ambition, to transplant into the\r\nplains of Latium the palm of lyric poetry.  Nor did he fail of success:\r\n\r\n    Exegi monumentum aere perennius.--Carm. iii. 30.\r\n    More durable than brass a monument I’ve raised.\r\n\r\nIn Greece, and other countries, the Ode appears to have been the most\r\nancient, as well as the most popular species of literary production.\r\nWarm in expression, and short in extent, it concentrates in narrow bounds\r\nthe fire of poetical transport: on which account, it has been generally\r\nemployed to celebrate the fervours of piety, the raptures of love, the\r\nenthusiasm of praise; and to animate warriors to glorious exertions of\r\nvalour:\r\n\r\n    Musa dedit fidibus Divos, puerosque Deorum,\r\n    Et pugilem victorem, et equum certamine primnm,\r\n    Et juvenum curas, et libera vina referre.--Hor. De Arte Poet.\r\n\r\n    The Muse to nobler subjects tunes her lyre;\r\n    Gods, and the sons of Gods, her song inspire;\r\n    Wrestler and steed, who gained the Olympic prize,\r\n    Love’s pleasing cares, and wine’s unbounded joys.--Francis.\r\n\r\n    Misenum Aeoliden, quo non praestantior alter\r\n    Aere ciere viros, Martemque accendere cnatu. [275]\r\n                                                Virgil, Aeneid, vi.\r\n         .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n\r\n    Sed tum forte cava dum personat aequora concha\r\n    Demens, et canto vocat in certamina Divos.--Ibid.\r\n\r\n    Misenus, son of Oeolus, renowned\r\n    The warrior trumpet in the field to sound;\r\n    With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms,\r\n    And rouse to dare their fate in honourable arms.\r\n\r\n       .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .\r\n\r\n    (175) Swollen with applause, and aiming still at more,\r\n    He now provokes the sea-gods from the shore.--Dryden\r\n\r\nThere arose in this department, among the Greeks, nine eminent poets,\r\nviz. Alcaeus, Alcman, Anacreon, Bacchylides, Ibicus, Sappho, Stesichorus,\r\nSimonides, and Pindar.  The greater number of this distinguished class\r\nare now known only by name.  They seem all to have differed from one\r\nanother, no less in the kind of measure which they chiefly or solely\r\nemployed, than in the strength or softness, the beauty or grandeur, the\r\nanimated rapidity or the graceful ease of their various compositions.  Of\r\nthe amorous effusions of the lyre, we yet have examples in the odes of\r\nAnacreon, and the incomparable ode of Sappho: the lyric strains which\r\nanimated to battle, have sunk into oblivion; but the victors in the\r\npublic games of Greece have their fame perpetuated in the admirable\r\nproductions of Pindar.\r\n\r\nHorace, by adopting, in the multiplicity of his subjects, almost all the\r\nvarious measures of the different Greek poets, and frequently combining\r\ndifferent measures in the same composition, has compensated for the\r\ndialects of that tongue, so happily suited to poetry, and given to a\r\nlanguage less distinguished for soft inflexions, all the tender and\r\ndelicate modulations of the Eastern song.  While he moves in the measures\r\nof the Greeks with an ease and gracefulness which rivals their own\r\nacknowledged excellence, he has enriched the fund of lyric harmony with a\r\nstanza peculiar to himself.  In the artificial construction of the Ode,\r\nhe may justly be regarded as the first of lyric poets.  In beautiful\r\nimagery, he is inferior to none: in variety of sentiment and felicity of\r\nexpression, superior to every existing competitor in Greek or Roman\r\npoetry.  He is elegant without affectation; and what is more remarkable,\r\nin the midst of gaiety he is moral.  We seldom meet in his Odes with the\r\nabrupt apostrophes of passionate excursion; but his transitions are\r\nconducted with ease, and every subject introduced with propriety.\r\n\r\nThe Carmen Seculare was written at the express desire of Augustus, for\r\nthe celebration of the Secular Games, performed once in a hundred years,\r\nand which continued during three days and three nights, whilst all Rome\r\nresounded with the mingled effusions of choral addresses to gods and\r\ngoddesses, and of festive joy.  An occasion which so much interested the\r\nambition of the poet, called into exertion the most vigorous efforts of\r\nhis genius.  More concise in mythological attributes than the hymns\r\nascribed to Homer, this beautiful production, in variety and grandeur of\r\ninvocation, and in pomp of numbers, surpasses all that Greece, (176)\r\nmelodious but simple in the service of the altar, ever poured forth from\r\nher vocal groves in solemn adoration.  By the force of native genius, the\r\nancients elevated their heroes to a pitch of sublimity that excites\r\nadmiration, but to soar beyond which they could derive no aid from\r\nmythology; and it was reserved for a bard, inspired with nobler\r\nsentiments than the Muses could supply, to sing the praises of that Being\r\nwhose ineffable perfections transcend all human imagination.  Of the\r\npraises of gods and heroes, there is not now extant a more beautiful\r\ncomposition, than the 12th Ode of the first book of Horace:\r\n\r\n    Quem virum aut heroa lyra vel acri\r\n    Tibia sumes celebrare, Clio?\r\n    Quem Deum? cujus recinet jocosa\r\n      Nomen imago,\r\n    Aut in umbrosis Heliconis oris, etc.\r\n\r\n    What man, what hero, on the tuneful lyre,\r\n    Or sharp-toned flute, will Clio choose to raise,\r\n    Deathless, to fame?  What God? whose hallowed name\r\n      The sportive image of the voice\r\n    Shall in the shades of Helicon repeat, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Satires of Horace are far from being remarkable for poetical harmony,\r\nas he himself acknowledges.  Indeed, according to the plan upon which\r\nseveral of them are written, it could scarcely be otherwise.  They are\r\nfrequently colloquial, sometimes interrogatory, the transitions quick,\r\nand the apostrophes abrupt.  It was not his object in those compositions,\r\nto soothe the ear with the melody of polished numbers, but to rally the\r\nfrailties of the heart, to convince the understanding by argument, and\r\nthence to put to shame both the vices and follies of mankind.  Satire is\r\na species of composition, of which the Greeks furnished no model; and the\r\npreceding Roman writers of this class, though they had much improved it\r\nfrom its original rudeness and licentiousness, had still not brought it\r\nto that degree of perfection which might answer the purpose of moral\r\nreform in a polished state of society.  It received the most essential\r\nimprovement from Horace, who has dexterously combined wit and argument,\r\nraillery and sarcasm, on the side of morality and virtue, of happiness\r\nand truth.\r\n\r\nThe Epistles of this author may be reckoned amongst the most valuable\r\nproductions of antiquity.  Except those of the second book, and one or\r\ntwo in the first, they are in general of the familiar kind; abounding in\r\nmoral sentiments, and judicious observations on life and manners.\r\n\r\nThe poem De Arte Poetica comprises a system of criticism, in justness of\r\nprinciple and extent of application, correspondent to the various\r\nexertions of genius on subjects of invention and taste.  (177) That in\r\ncomposing this excellent production, he availed himself of the most\r\napproved works of Grecian original, we may conclude from the advice which\r\nhe there recommends:\r\n\r\n    ------------Vos exemplaria Graeca\r\n    Nocturna versate manu, versate diurna.\r\n\r\n    Make the Greek authors your supreme delight;\r\n    Read them by day, and study them by night.--Francis.\r\n\r\nIn the writings of Horace there appears a fund of good sense, enlivened\r\nwith pleasantry, and refined by philosophical reflection.  He had\r\ncultivated his judgment with great application, and his taste was guided\r\nby intuitive perception of moral beauty, aptitude, and propriety.  The\r\nfew instances of indelicacy which occur in his compositions, we may\r\nascribe rather to the manners of the times, than to any blameable\r\npropensity in the author.  Horace died in the fifty-seventh year of his\r\nage, surviving his beloved Mecaenas only three weeks; a circumstance\r\nwhich, added to the declaration in an ode [276] to that personage,\r\nsupposed to have been written in Mecaenas’s last illness, has given rise\r\nto a conjecture, that Horace ended his days by a violent death, to\r\naccompany his friend.  But it is more natural to conclude that he died of\r\nexcessive grief, as, had he literally adhered to the affirmation\r\ncontained in the ode, he would have followed his patron more closely.\r\nThis seems to be confirmed by a fact immediately preceding his death; for\r\nthough he declared Augustus heir to his whole estate, he was not able, on\r\naccount of weakness, to put his signature to the will; a failure which it\r\nis probable that he would have taken care to obviate, had his death been\r\npremeditated.  He was interred, at his own desire, near the tomb of\r\nMecaenas.----\r\n\r\nOVID was born of an equestrian family, at Sulmo, a town of the Peligni,\r\non the 21st of March, in the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa.  His father\r\nintended him for the bar; and after passing him through the usual course\r\nof instruction at Rome, he was sent to Athens, the emporium of learning,\r\nto complete his education.  On his return to Rome, in obedience to the\r\ndesire of his father, he entered upon the offices of public life in the\r\nforum, and declaimed with great applause.  But this was the effect of\r\npaternal authority, not of choice: for, from his earliest years, he\r\ndiscovered an extreme attachment to poetry; and no sooner was his father\r\ndead, than, renouncing the bar, he devoted himself entirely to the\r\ncultivation of that fascinating art, his propensity to which was\r\ninvincible.  His productions, all written either in heroic or pentameter\r\nverse, are numerous, and on various subjects.  It will be sufficient to\r\nmention them briefly.\r\n\r\n(178) The Heroides consist of twenty-one Epistles, all which, except\r\nthree, are feigned to be written from celebrated women of antiquity, to\r\ntheir husbands or lovers, such as Penelope to Ulysses, Dido to Aeneas,\r\nSappho to Phaon, etc.  These compositions are nervous, animated and\r\nelegant: they discover a high degree of poetic enthusiasm, but blended\r\nwith that lascivious turn of thought, which pervades all the amorous\r\nproductions of this celebrated author.\r\n\r\nThe elegies on subjects of love, particularly the Ars Amandi, or Ars\r\nAmatoria, though not all uniform in versification, possess the same\r\ngeneral character, of warmth of passion, and luscious description, as the\r\nepistles.\r\n\r\nThe Fasti were divided into twelve books, of which only the first six now\r\nremain.  The design of them was to deliver an account of the Roman\r\nfestivals in every month of the year, with a description of the rites and\r\nceremonies, as well as the sacrifices on those occasions.  It is to be\r\nregretted, that, on a subject so interesting, this valuable work should\r\nnot have been transmitted entire: but in the part which remains, we are\r\nfurnished with a beautiful description of the ceremonial transactions in\r\nthe Roman calendar, from the first of January to the end of June.  The\r\nversification, as in all the compositions of this author, is easy and\r\nharmonious.\r\n\r\nThe most popular production of this poet is his Metamorphoses, not less\r\nextraordinary for the nature of the subject, than for the admirable art\r\nwith which the whole is conducted.  The work is founded upon the\r\ntraditions and theogony of the ancients, which consisted of various\r\ndetached fables.  Those Ovid has not only so happily arranged, that they\r\nform a coherent series of narratives, one rising out of another; but he\r\ndescribes the different changes with such an imposing plausibility, as to\r\ngive a natural appearance to the most incredible fictions.  This\r\ningenious production, however perfect it may appear, we are told by\r\nhimself, had not received his last corrections when he was ordered into\r\nbanishment.\r\n\r\nIn the Ibis, the author imitates a poem of the same name, written by\r\nCallimachus.  It is an invective against some person who publicly\r\ntraduced his character at Rome, after his banishment.  A strong\r\nsensibility, indignation, and implacable resentment, are conspicuous\r\nthrough the whole.\r\n\r\nThe Tristia were composed in his exile, in which, though his vivacity\r\nforsook him, he still retained a genius prolific in versification.  In\r\nthese poems, as well as in many epistles to different persons, he bewails\r\nhis unhappy situation, and deprecates in the strongest terms the\r\ninexorable displeasure of Augustus.\r\n\r\nSeveral other productions written by Ovid are now lost, and (179) amongst\r\nthem a tragedy called Medea, of which Quintilian expresses a high\r\nopinion.  Ovidii Medea videtur mihi ostendere quantum vir ille praestare\r\npotuerit, si ingenio suo temperare quam indulgere maluisset [277].  Lib.\r\nx. c. 1.\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiarity in the productions of this author, that, on whatever\r\nhe employs his pen, he exhausts the subject; not with any prolixity that\r\nfatigues the attention, but by a quick succession of new ideas, equally\r\nbrilliant and apposite, often expressed in antitheses.  Void of obscenity\r\nin expression, but lascivious in sentiment, he may be said rather to\r\nstimulate immorally the natural passions, than to corrupt the\r\nimagination.  No poet is more guided in versification by the nature of\r\nhis subject than Ovid.  In common narrative, his ideas are expressed with\r\nalmost colloquial simplicity; but when his fancy glows with sentiment, or\r\nis animated by objects of grandeur, his style is proportionably elevated,\r\nand he rises to a pitch of sublimity.\r\n\r\nNo point in ancient history has excited more variety of conjectures than\r\nthe banishment of Ovid; but after all the efforts of different writers to\r\nelucidate the subject, the cause of this extraordinary transaction\r\nremains involved in obscurity.  It may therefore not be improper, in this\r\nplace, to examine the foundation of the several conjectures which have\r\nbeen formed, and if they appear to be utterly imadmissible, to attempt a\r\nsolution of the question upon principles more conformable to probability,\r\nand countenanced by historical evidence.\r\n\r\nThe ostensible reason assigned by Augustus for banishing Ovid, was his\r\ncorrupting the Roman youth by lascivious publications; but it is evident,\r\nfrom various passages in the poet’s productions after this period, that\r\nthere was, besides, some secret reason, which would not admit of being\r\ndivulged.  He says in his Tristia, Lib. ii. 1--\r\n\r\n    Perdiderent cum me duo crimina, carmen et errors. [278]\r\n\r\nIt appears from another passage in the same work, that this inviolable\r\narcanum was something which Ovid had seen, and, as he insinuates, through\r\nhis own ignorance and mistake.\r\n\r\n    Cur aliquid vidi? cur conscia lumina feci?\r\n      Cur imprudenti cognita culpa mihi est?--Ibid.\r\n         *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n    (180) Inscia quod crimen viderunt lumina, plector:\r\n      Peccatumque oculos est habuisse meum. [279]     De Trist. iii. 5.\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, to be a fact sufficiently established, that Ovid had\r\nseen something of a very indecent nature, in which Augustus was\r\nconcerned.  What this was, is the question.  Some authors, conceiving it\r\nto have been of a kind extremely atrocious, have gone so far as to\r\nsuppose, that it must have been an act of criminality between Augustus\r\nand his own daughter Julia, who, notwithstanding the strict attention\r\npaid to her education by her father, became a woman of the most infamous\r\ncharacter; suspected of incontinence during her marriage with Agrippa,\r\nand openly profligate after her union with her next husband, Tiberius.\r\nThis supposition, however, rests entirely upon conjecture, and is not\r\nonly discredited by its own improbability, but by a yet more forcible\r\nargument.  It is certain that Julia was at this time in banishment for\r\nher scandalous life.  She was about the same age with Tiberius, who was\r\nnow forty seven, and they had not cohabited for many years.  We know not\r\nexactly the year in which Augustus sent her into exile, but we may\r\nconclude with confidence, that it happened soon after her separation from\r\nTiberius; whose own interest with the emperor, as well as that of his\r\nmother Livia, could not fail of being exerted, if any such application\r\nwas necessary, towards removing from the capital a woman, who, by the\r\nnotoriety of her prostitution, reflected disgrace upon all with whom she\r\nwas connected, either by blood or alliance.  But no application from\r\nTiberius or his mother could be necessary, when we are assured that\r\nAugustus even presented to the senate a narrative respecting the infamous\r\nbehaviour of his daughter, which was read by the quaestor.  He was so\r\nmuch ashamed of her profligacy, that he for a long time declined all\r\ncompany, and had thoughts of putting her to death.  She was banished to\r\nan island on the coast of Campania for five years; at the expiration of\r\nwhich period, she was removed to the continent, and the severity of her\r\ntreatment a little mitigated; but though frequent applications were made\r\nin her behalf by the people, Augustus never could be prevailed upon to\r\npermit her return.\r\n\r\n(181) Other writers have conjectured, that, instead of Julia, the\r\ndaughter of Augustus, the person seen with him by Ovid may have been\r\nJulia his grand-daughter, who inherited the vicious disposition of her\r\nmother, and was on that account likewise banished by Augustus.  The epoch\r\nof this lady’s banishment it is impossible to ascertain; and therefore no\r\nargument can be drawn from that source to invalidate the present\r\nconjecture.  But Augustus had shown the same solicitude for her being\r\ntrained up in virtuous habits, as he had done in respect of her mother,\r\nthough in both cases unsuccessfully; and this consideration, joined to\r\nthe enormity of the supposed crime, and the great sensibility which\r\nAugustus had discovered with regard to the infamy of his daughter, seems\r\nsufficient to exonerate his memory from so odious a charge.  Besides, is\r\nit possible that he could have sent her into banishment for the infamy of\r\nher prostitution, while (upon the supposition of incest) she was mistress\r\nof so important a secret, as that he himself had been more criminal with\r\nher than any other man in the empire?\r\n\r\nSome writers, giving a wider scope to conjecture, have supposed the\r\ntransaction to be of a nature still more detestable, and have even\r\ndragged Mecaenas, the minister, into a participation of the crime.\r\nFortunately, however, for the reputation of the illustrious patron of\r\npolite learning, as well as for that of the emperor, this crude\r\nconjecture may be refuted upon the evidence of chronology.  The\r\ncommencement of Ovid’s exile happened in the ninth year of the Christian\r\naera, and the death of Mecaenas, eight years before that period.  Between\r\nthis and other calculations, we find a difference of three or four years;\r\nbut allowing the utmost latitude of variation, there intervened, from the\r\ndeath of Mecaenas to the banishment of Ovid, a period of eleven years; an\r\nobservation which fully invalidates the conjecture above-mentioned.\r\n\r\nHaving now refuted, as it is presumed, the opinions of the different\r\ncommentators on this subject, we shall proceed to offer a new conjecture,\r\nwhich seems to have a greater claim to probability than any that has\r\nhitherto been suggested.\r\n\r\nSuetonius informs us, that Augustus, in the latter part of his life,\r\ncontracted a vicious inclination for the enjoyment of young virgins, who\r\nwere procured for him from all parts, not only with the connivance, but\r\nby the clandestine management of his consort Livia.  It was therefore\r\nprobably with one of those victims that he was discovered by Ovid.\r\nAugustus had for many years affected a decency of behaviour, and he\r\nwould, therefore, naturally be not a little disconcerted at the\r\nunseasonable intrusion of the poet.  That Ovid knew not of Augustus’s\r\nbeing in the place, is beyond all doubt: and Augustus’s consciousness\r\n(182) of this circumstance, together with the character of Ovid, would\r\nsuggest an unfavourable suspicion of the motive which had brought the\r\nlatter thither.  Abstracted from the immorality of the emperor’s own\r\nconduct, the incident might be regarded as ludicrous, and certainly was\r\nmore fit to excite the shame than the indignation of Augustus.  But the\r\npurpose of Ovid’s visit appears, from his own acknowledgment, to have\r\nbeen not entirely free from blame, though of what nature we know not:\r\n\r\n    Non equidem totam possum defendere culpam:\r\n      Sed partem nostri criminis error habet.\r\n                                       De Trist. Lib. iii. Eleg. 5.\r\n\r\n    I know I cannot wholly be defended,\r\n    Yet plead ‘twas chance, no ill was then intended.--Catlin.\r\n\r\nOvid was at this time turned of fifty, and though by a much younger man\r\nhe would not have been regarded as any object of jealousy in love, yet by\r\nAugustus, now in his sixty-ninth year, he might be deemed a formidable\r\nrival.  This passion, therefore, concurring with that which arose from\r\nthe interruption or disappointment of gratification, inflamed the\r\nemperor’s resentment, and he resolved on banishing to a distant country a\r\nman whom he considered as his rival, and whose presence, from what had\r\nhappened, he never more could endure.\r\n\r\nAugustus having determined on the banishment of Ovid, could find little\r\ndifficulty in accommodating the ostensible to the secret and real cause\r\nof this resolution.\r\n\r\nNo argument to establish the date of publication, can be drawn from the\r\norder in which the various productions of Ovid are placed in the\r\ncollection of his works: but reasoning from probability, we should\r\nsuppose that the Ars Amandi was written during the period of his youth;\r\nand this seems to be confirmed by the following passage in the second\r\nbook of the Fasti:\r\n\r\n    Certe ego vos habui faciles in amore ministros;\r\n      Cum lusit numeris prima juventa suis. [280]\r\n\r\nThat many years must have elapsed since its original publication, is\r\nevident from the subsequent lines in the second book of the Tristia:\r\n\r\n    Nos quoque jam pridem scripto peccavimus uno.\r\n      Supplicium patitur non nova culpa novum.\r\n    Carminaque edideram, cum te delicta notantem\r\n      Praeterii toties jure quietus eques.\r\n    (183) Ergo, quae juveni mihi non nocitura putavi\r\n    Scripta parum prudens, nunc nocuere seni? [281]\r\n\r\nWith what show, then, of justice, it may be asked, could Augustus now\r\npunish a fault, which, in his solemn capacity of censor, he had so long\r\nand repeatedly overlooked?  The answer is obvious: in a production so\r\npopular as we may be assured the Ars Amandi was amongst the Roman youth,\r\nit must have passed through several editions in the course of some years:\r\nand one of those coinciding with the fatal discovery, afforded the\r\nemperor a specious pretext for the execution of his purpose.  The\r\nseverity exercised on this occasion, however, when the poet was suddenly\r\ndriven into exile, unaccompanied even by the partner of his bed, who had\r\nbeen his companion for many years, was an act so inconsistent with the\r\nusual moderation of Augustus, that we cannot justly ascribe it to any\r\nother motive than personal resentment; especially as this arbitrary\r\npunishment of the author could answer no end of public utility, while the\r\nobnoxious production remained to affect, if it really ever did\r\nessentially affect, the morals of society.  If the sensibility of\r\nAugustus could not thenceforth admit of any personal intercourse with\r\nOvid, or even of his living within the limits of Italy, there would have\r\nbeen little danger from the example, in sending into honourable exile,\r\nwith every indulgence which could alleviate so distressful a necessity, a\r\nman of respectable rank in the state, who was charged with no actual\r\noffence against the laws, and whose genius, with all its indiscretion,\r\ndid immortal honour to his country.  It may perhaps be urged, that,\r\nconsidering the predicament in which Augustus stood, he discovered a\r\nforbearance greater than might have been expected from an absolute\r\nprince, in sparing the life of Ovid.  It will readily be granted, that\r\nOvid, in the same circumstances, under any one of the four subsequent\r\nemperors, would have expiated the incident with his blood.  Augustus,\r\nupon a late occasion, had shown himself equally sanguinary, for he put to\r\ndeath, by the hand of Varus, a poet of Parma, named Cassius, on account\r\nof his having written some satirical verses against him.  By that recent\r\nexample, therefore, and the power of pardoning which the emperor still\r\nretained, there was sufficient hold of the poet’s secrecy respecting the\r\nfatal transaction, which, if divulged (184) to the world, Augustus would\r\nreprobate as a false and infamous libel, and punish the author\r\naccordingly.  Ovid, on his part, was sensible, that, should he dare to\r\nviolate the important but tacit injunction, the imperial vengeance would\r\nreach him even on the shores of the Euxine.  It appears, however, from a\r\npassage in the Ibis, which can apply to no other than Augustus, that Ovid\r\nwas not sent into banishment destitute of pecuniary provision:\r\n\r\n    Di melius! quorum longe mihi maximus ille,\r\n      Qui nostras inopes noluit esse vias.\r\n    Huic igitur meritas grates, ubicumque licebit,\r\n      Pro tam mansueto pectore semper agam.\r\n\r\n    The gods defend! of whom he’s far the chief,\r\n    Who lets me not, though banished, want relief.\r\n    For this his favour therefore whilst I live,\r\n    Where’er I am, deserved thanks I’ll give.\r\n\r\nWhat sum the emperor bestowed, for the support of a banishment which he\r\nwas resolved should be perpetual, it is impossible to ascertain; but he\r\nhad formerly been liberal to Ovid, as well as to other poets.\r\n\r\nIf we might hazard a conjecture respecting the scene of the intrigue\r\nwhich occasioned the banishment of Ovid, we should place it in some\r\nrecess in the emperor’s gardens.  His house, though called Palatium, the\r\npalace, as being built on the Palatine hill, and inhabited by the\r\nsovereign, was only a small mansion, which had formerly belonged to\r\nHortensius, the orator.  Adjoining to this place Augustus had built the\r\ntemple of Apollo, which he endowed with a public library, and allotted\r\nfor the use of poets, to recite their compositions to each other.  Ovid\r\nwas particularly intimate with Hyginus, one of Augustus’s freedmen, who\r\nwas librarian of the temple.  He might therefore have been in the\r\nlibrary, and spying from the window a young female secreting herself in\r\nthe gardens, he had the curiosity to follow her.\r\n\r\nThe place of Ovid’s banishment was Tomi [282], now said to be Baba, a\r\ntown of Bulgaria, towards the mouth of the Ister, where is a lake still\r\ncalled by the natives Ouvidouve Jesero, the lake of Ovid.  In this\r\nretirement, and the Euxine Pontus, he passed the remainder of his life, a\r\nmelancholy period of seven years.  Notwithstanding the lascivious\r\nwritings of Ovid, it does not appear that he was in his conduct a\r\nlibertine.  He was three times married: his first wife, who was of mean\r\nextraction, and (185) whom he had married when he was very young, he\r\ndivorced; the second he dismissed on account of her immodest behaviour;\r\nand the third appears to have survived him.  He had a number of\r\nrespectable friends, and seems to have been much beloved by them.----\r\n\r\nTIBULLUS was descended of an equestrian family, and is said, but\r\nerroneously, as will afterwards appear, to have been born on the same day\r\nwith Ovid.  His amiable accomplishments procured him the friendship of\r\nMessala Corvinus, whom he accompanied in a military expedition to the\r\nisland of Corcyra.  But an indisposition with which he was seized, and a\r\nnatural aversion to the toils of war, induced him to return to Rome,\r\nwhere he seems to have resigned himself to a life of indolence and\r\npleasure, amidst which he devoted a part of his time to the composition\r\nof elegies.  Elegiac poetry had been cultivated by several Greek writers,\r\nparticularly Callimachus, Mimnermus, and Philetas; but, so far as we can\r\nfind, had, until the present age, been unknown to the Romans in their own\r\ntongue.  It consisted of a heroic and pentameter line alternately, and\r\nwas not, like the elegy of the moderns, usually appropriated to the\r\nlamentation of the deceased, but employed chiefly in compositions\r\nrelative to love or friendship, and might, indeed, be used upon almost\r\nany subject; though, from the limp in the pentameter line, it is not\r\nsuitable to sublime subjects, which require a fulness of expression, and\r\nan expansion of sound.  To this species of poetry Tibullus restricted his\r\napplication, by which he cultivated that simplicity and tenderness, and\r\nagreeable ease of sentiment, which constitute the characteristic\r\nperfections of the elegiac muse.\r\n\r\nIn the description of rural scenes, the peaceful occupations of the\r\nfield, the charms of domestic happiness, and the joys of reciprocal love,\r\nscarcely any poet surpasses Tibullus.  His luxuriant imagination collects\r\nthe most beautiful flowers of nature, and he displays them with all the\r\ndelicate attraction of soft and harmonious numbers.  With a dexterity\r\npeculiar to himself, in whatever subject he engages, he leads his readers\r\nimperceptibly through devious paths of pleasure, of which, at the outset\r\nof the poem, they could form no conception.  He seems to have often\r\nwritten without any previous meditation or design.  Several of his\r\nelegies may be said to have neither middle nor end: yet the transitions\r\nare so natural, and the gradations so easy, that though we wander through\r\nElysian scenes of fancy, the most heterogeneous in their nature, we are\r\nsensible of no defect in the concatenation which has joined them\r\ntogether.  It is, however, to be regretted that, in some instances,\r\nTibullus betrays that licentiousness of manners which (186) formed too\r\ngeneral a characteristic even of this refined age.  His elegies addressed\r\nto Messala contain a beautiful amplification of sentiments founded in\r\nfriendship and esteem, in which it is difficult to say, whether the\r\nvirtues of the patron or the genius of the poet be more conspicuous.\r\n\r\nValerius Messala Corvinus, whom he celebrates, was descended of a very\r\nancient family.  In the civil wars which followed the death of Julius\r\nCaesar he joined the republican party, and made himself master of the\r\ncamp of Octavius at Philippi; but he was afterwards reconciled to his\r\nopponent, and lived to an advanced age in favour and esteem with\r\nAugustus.  He was distinguished not only by his military talents, but by\r\nhis eloquence, integrity, and patriotism.\r\n\r\nFrom the following passage in the writings of Tibullus, commentators have\r\nconjectured that he was deprived of his lands by the same proscription in\r\nwhich those of Virgil had been involved:\r\n\r\n    Cui fuerant flavi ditantes ordine sulci\r\n    Horrea, faecundas ad deficientia messes,\r\n    Cuique pecus denso pascebant agmine colles,\r\n    Et domino satis, et nimium furique lupoque:\r\n    Nunc desiderium superest: nam cura novatur,\r\n    Cum memor anteactos semper dolor admovet annos.\r\n                                              Lib. iv. El. 1.\r\n\r\nBut this seems not very probable, when we consider that Horace, several\r\nyears after that period, represents him as opulent.\r\n\r\n    Dii tibi divitias dederant, artemque fruendi.\r\n                                            Epist. Lib. i. 4.\r\n    To thee the gods a fair estate\r\n    In bounty gave, with heart to know\r\n    How to enjoy what they bestow.--Francis.\r\n\r\nWe know not the age of Tibullus at the time of his death; but in an elegy\r\nwritten by Ovid upon that occasion, he is spoken of as a young man.  Were\r\nit true, as is said by biographers, that he was born the same day with\r\nOvid, we must indeed assign the event to an early period: for Ovid cannot\r\nhave written the elegy after the forty-third year of his own life, and\r\nhow long before is uncertain.  In the tenth elegy of the fourth book, De\r\nTristibus, he observes, that the fates had allowed little time for the\r\ncultivation of his friendship with Tibullus.\r\n\r\n    Virgilium vidi tantum: nec avara Tibullo\r\n      Tempus amicitiae fata dedere meae.\r\n    Successor fuit hic tibi, Galle; Propertius illi:\r\n      Quartus ab his serie temporis ipse fui.\r\n    Utque ego majores, sic me coluere minores.\r\n\r\n    (187) Virgil I only saw, and envious fate\r\n    Did soon my friend Tibullus hence translate.\r\n    He followed Gallus, and Propertius him,\r\n    And I myself was fourth in course of time.--Catlin.\r\n\r\nAs both Ovid and Tibullus lived at Rome, were both of the equestrian\r\norder, and of congenial dispositions, it is natural to suppose that their\r\nacquaintance commenced at an early period; and if, after all, it was of\r\nshort duration, there would be no improbability in concluding, that\r\nTibullus died at the age of some years under thirty.  It is evident,\r\nhowever, that biographers have committed a mistake with regard to the\r\nbirth of this poet; for in the passage above cited of the Tristia, Ovid\r\nmentions Tibullus as a writer, who, though his contemporary, was much\r\nolder than himself.  From this passage we should be justified in placing\r\nthe death of Tibullus between the fortieth and fiftieth year of his age,\r\nand rather nearer to the latter period; for, otherwise, Horace would\r\nscarcely have mentioned him in the manner he does in one of his epistles.\r\n\r\n    Albi, nostrorum sermonum candide judex,\r\n    Quid nunc te dicam facere in regione Pedana?\r\n    Scribere quod Cassi Parmensis opuscula vincat;\r\n    An tacitum silvas inter reptare salubres,\r\n    Curantem quicquid dignam sapiente bonoque est?--Epist. i. 4.\r\n\r\n        Albius, in whom my satires find\r\n        A critic, candid, just, and kind,\r\n        Do you, while at your country seat,\r\n        Some rhyming labours meditate,\r\n        That shall in volumed bulk arise,\r\n        And e’en from Cassius bear the prize;\r\n        Or saunter through the silent wood,\r\n        Musing on what befits the good.--Francis.\r\n\r\nThis supposition is in no degree inconsistent with the authority of Ovid,\r\nwhere he mentions him as a young man; for the Romans extended the period\r\nof youth to the fiftieth year.----\r\n\r\nPROPERTIUS was born at Mevania, a town of Umbria, seated at the\r\nconfluence of the Tina and Clitumnus.  This place was famous for its\r\nherds of white cattle, brought up there for sacrifice, and supposed to be\r\nimpregnated with that colour by the waters of the river last mentioned.\r\n\r\n    Hinc albi, Clitumne, greges, et maxima taurus\r\n    Victima, saepe tuo perfusi fluorine sacro,\r\n    Romanos ad templa Deum duxere triumphos.--Georg. ii.\r\n\r\n    And where thy sacred streams, Clitumnus! flow,\r\n    White herds, and stateliest bulls that oft have led\r\n    Triumphant Rome, and on her altars bled.--Sotheby.\r\n\r\n(188) His father is said by some to have been a Roman knight, and they\r\nadd, that he was one of those who, when L. Antony was starved out of\r\nPerasia, were, by the order of Octavius, led to the altar of Julius\r\nCaesar, and there slain.  Nothing more is known with certainty, than that\r\nPropertius lost his father at an early age, and being deprived of a great\r\npart of his patrimony, betook himself to Rome, where his genius soon\r\nrecommended him to public notice, and he obtained the patronage of\r\nMecaenas.  From his frequent introduction of historical and mythological\r\nsubjects into his poems, he received the appellation of “the learned.”\r\n\r\nOf all the Latin elegiac poets, Propertius has the justest claim to\r\npurity of thought and expression.  He often draws his imagery from\r\nreading, more than from the imagination, and abounds less in description\r\nthan sentiment.  For warmth of passion he is not conspicuous, and his\r\ntenderness is seldom marked with a great degree of sensibility; but,\r\nwithout rapture, he is animated, and, like Horace, in the midst of\r\ngaiety, he is moral.  The stores with which learning supplies him\r\ndiversify as well as illustrate his subject, while delicacy every where\r\ndiscovers a taste refined by the habit of reflection.  His versification,\r\nin general, is elegant, but not uniformly harmonious.\r\n\r\nTibullus and Propertius have each written four books of Elegies; and it\r\nhas been disputed which of them is superior in this department of poetry.\r\nQuintilian has given his suffrage in favour of Tibullus, who, so far as\r\npoetical merit alone is the object of consideration, seems entitled to\r\nthe preference.----\r\n\r\nGALLUS was a Roman knight, distinguished not only for poetical, but\r\nmilitary talents.  Of his poetry we have only six elegies, written, in\r\nthe person of an old man, on the subject of old age, but which, there is\r\nreason to think, were composed at an earlier part of the author’s life.\r\nExcept the fifth elegy, which is tainted with immodesty, the others,\r\nparticularly the first, are highly beautiful, and may be placed in\r\ncompetition with any other productions of the elegiac kind.  Gallus was,\r\nfor some time, in great favour with Augustus, who appointed him governor\r\nof Egypt.  It is said, however, that he not only oppressed the province\r\nby extortion, but entered into a conspiracy against his benefactor, for\r\nwhich he was banished.  Unable to sustain such a reverse of fortune, he\r\nfell into despair, and laid violent hands on himself.  This is the Gallus\r\nin honour of whom Virgil composed his tenth eclogue.\r\n\r\nSuch are the celebrated productions of the Augustan age, which have been\r\nhappily preserved, for the delight and admiration of mankind, and will\r\nsurvive to the latest posterity.  Many (189) more once existed, of\r\nvarious merit, and of different authors, which have left few or no\r\nmemorials behind them, but have perished promiscuously amidst the\r\nindiscriminate ravages of time, of accidents, and of barbarians.  Amongst\r\nthe principal authors whose works are lost, are Varius and Valgius; the\r\nformer of whom, besides a panegyric upon Augustus, composed some\r\ntragedies.  According to Quintilian, his Thyestes was equal to any\r\ncomposition of the Greek tragic poets.\r\n\r\nThe great number of eminent writers, poets in particular, who adorned\r\nthis age, has excited general admiration, and the phenomenon is usually\r\nascribed to a fortuitous occurrence, which baffles all inquiry: but we\r\nshall endeavour to develop the various causes which seem to have produced\r\nthis effect; and should the explanation appear satisfactory, it may\r\nfavour an opinion, that under similar circumstances, if ever they should\r\nagain be combined, a period of equal glory might arise in other ages and\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, whether from the influence of climate, or their mode of\r\nliving, which in general was temperate, were endowed with a lively\r\nimagination, and, as we before observed, a spirit of enterprise.  Upon\r\nthe final termination of the Punic war, and the conquest of Greece, their\r\nardour, which had hitherto been exercised in military achievements, was\r\ndiverted into the channel of literature; and the civil commotions which\r\nfollowed, having now ceased, a fresh impulse was given to activity in the\r\nambitious pursuit of the laurel, which was now only to be obtained by\r\nglorious exertions of intellect.  The beautiful productions of Greece,\r\noperating strongly upon their minds, excited them to imitation;\r\nimitation, when roused amongst a number, produced emulation; and\r\nemulation cherished an extraordinary thirst of fame, which, in every\r\nexertion of the human mind, is the parent of excellence.  This liberal\r\ncontention was not a little promoted by the fashion introduced at Rome,\r\nfor poets to recite their compositions in public; a practice which seems\r\nto have been carried even to a ridiculous excess.--Such was now the rage\r\nfor poetical composition in the Roman capital, that Horace describes it\r\nin the following terms:\r\n\r\n    Mutavit mentem populus levis, et calet uno\r\n    Scribendi studio: pueri patresque severi\r\n    Fronde comas vincti coenant, et carmina dictant.--Epist. ii. 1.\r\n         *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n        Now the light people bend to other aims;\r\n        A lust of scribbling every breast inflames;\r\n        Our youth, our senators, with bays are crowned,\r\n        And rhymes eternal as our feasts go round.\r\n\r\n    (190) Scribimus indocti doctique poemata passim.--Hor. Epeat. ii. 1.\r\n\r\n        But every desperate blockhead dares to write,\r\n        Verse is the trade of every living wight.--Francis.\r\n\r\nThe thirst of fame above mentioned, was a powerful incentive, and is\r\navowed both by Virgil and Horace.  The former, in the third book of his\r\nGeorgics, announces a resolution of rendering himself celebrated, if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n        --------tentanda via est qua me quoque possim\r\n        Tollere humo, victorque virum volitare per ora.\r\n\r\n    I, too, will strive o’er earth my flight to raise,\r\n    And wing’d by victory, catch the gale of praise.--Sotheby.\r\n\r\nAnd Horace, in the conclusion of his first Ode, expresses himself in\r\nterms which indicate a similar purpose.\r\n\r\n        Quad si me lyricis vatibis inseres,\r\n        Sublimi feriam sidera vertice.\r\n\r\n    But if you rank me with the choir,\r\n    Who tuned with art the Grecian lyre;\r\n    Swift to the noblest heights of fame,\r\n    Shall rise thy poet’s deathless name.--Francis.\r\n\r\nEven Sallust, a historian, in his introduction to Catiline’s Conspiracy,\r\nscruples not to insinuate the same kind of ambition.  Quo mihi rectius\r\nvidetur ingenii quam virium opibus gloriam quaerere; et quoniam vita\r\nipsa, qua fruimur, brevis est, memoriam nostri quam maxume longam\r\nefficere. [283]\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance of great importance, towards the production of such\r\npoetry as might live through every age, was the extreme attention which\r\nthe great poets of this period displayed, both in the composition, and\r\nthe polishing of their works.  Virgil, when employed upon the Georgics,\r\nusually wrote in the morning, and applied much of the subsequent part of\r\nthe day to correction and improvement.  He compared himself to a bear,\r\nthat licks her cub into form.  If this was his regular practice in the\r\nGeorgics, we may justly suppose that it was the same in the Aeneid.  Yet,\r\nafter all this labour, he intended to devote three years entirely to its\r\nfarther amendment.  Horace has gone so far in recommending careful\r\ncorrection, that he figuratively mentions nine years as an adequate\r\nperiod for that purpose.  But whatever may be the time, there is no\r\nprecept which he urges either oftener or more forcibly, than a due\r\nattention to this important subject.\r\n\r\n    (191) Saepe stylum vertas, iterum quae digna legi sint\r\n    Scripturus.--Sat. i. x.\r\n\r\n    Would you a reader’s just esteem engage?\r\n    Correct with frequent care the blotted page.--Francis.\r\n\r\n                               --------Vos, O\r\n    Pompilius sanguis, carmen reprehendite, quod non\r\n    Multa dies et multa litura coercuit, atque\r\n    Perfectum decies non castigavit ad uuguem.\r\n                                          De. Art. Poet.\r\n\r\n    Sons of Pompilius, with contempt receive,\r\n    Nor let the hardy poem hope to live,\r\n    Where time and full correction don’t refine\r\n    The finished work, and polish every line.--Francis.\r\n\r\nTo the several causes above enumerated, as concurring to form the great\r\nsuperiority of the Augustan age, as respects the productions of\r\nliterature, one more is to be subjoined, of a nature the most essential:\r\nthe liberal and unparalleled encouragement given to distinguished talents\r\nby the emperor and his minister.  This was a principle of the most\r\npowerful energy: it fanned the flame of genius, invigorated every\r\nexertion; and the poets who basked in the rays of imperial favour, and\r\nthe animating patronage of Mecaenas, experienced a poetic enthusiasm\r\nwhich approached to real inspiration.\r\n\r\nHaving now finished the proposed explanation, relative to the celebrity\r\nof the Augustan age, we shall conclude with recapitulating in a few words\r\nthe causes of this extraordinary occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe models, then, which the Romans derived from Grecian poetry, were the\r\nfinest productions of human genius; their incentives to emulation were\r\nthe strongest that could actuate the heart.  With ardour, therefore, and\r\nindustry in composing, and with unwearied patience in polishing their\r\ncompositions, they attained to that glorious distinction in literature,\r\nwhich no succeeding age has ever rivalled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIBERIUS NERO CAESAR.\r\n\r\n(192)\r\n\r\nI.  The patrician family of the Claudii (for there was a plebeian family\r\nof the same name, no way inferior to the other either in power or\r\ndignity) came originally from Regilli, a town of the Sabines.  They\r\nremoved thence to Rome soon after the building of the city, with a great\r\nbody of their dependants, under Titus Tatius, who reigned jointly with\r\nRomulus in the kingdom; or, perhaps, what is related upon better\r\nauthority, under Atta Claudius, the head of the family, who was admitted\r\nby the senate into the patrician order six years after the expulsion of\r\nthe Tarquins.  They likewise received from the state, lands beyond the\r\nAnio for their followers, and a burying-place for themselves near the\r\ncapitol [284].  After this period, in process of time, the family had the\r\nhonour of twenty-eight consulships, five dictatorships, seven\r\ncensorships, seven triumphs, and two ovations.  Their descendants were\r\ndistinguished by various praenomina and cognomina [285], but rejected by\r\ncommon consent the praenomen of (193) Lucius, when, of the two races who\r\nbore it, one individual had been convicted of robbery, and another of\r\nmurder.  Amongst other cognomina, they assumed that of Nero, which in the\r\nSabine language signifies strong and valiant.\r\n\r\nII.  It appears from record, that many of the Claudii have performed\r\nsignal services to the state, as well as committed acts of delinquency.\r\nTo mention the most remarkable only, Appius Caecus dissuaded the senate\r\nfrom agreeing to an alliance with Pyrrhus, as prejudicial to the republic\r\n[286].  Claudius Candex first passed the straits of Sicily with a fleet,\r\nand drove the Carthaginians out of the island [287].  Claudius Nero cut\r\noff Hasdrubal with a vast army upon his arrival in Italy from Spain,\r\nbefore he could form a junction with his brother Hannibal [288].  On the\r\nother hand, Claudius Appius Regillanus, one of the Decemvirs, made a\r\nviolent attempt to have a free virgin, of whom he was enamoured, adjudged\r\na slave; which caused the people to secede a second time from the senate\r\n[289].  Claudius Drusus erected a statue of himself wearing a crown at\r\nAppii Forum [290], and endeavoured, by means of his dependants, to make\r\nhimself master of Italy.  Claudius Pulcher, when, off the coast of Sicily\r\n[291], the pullets used for taking augury would not eat, in contempt of\r\nthe omen threw them overboard, as if they should drink at least, if they\r\nwould not eat; and then engaging the enemy, was routed.  After his\r\ndefeat, when he (194) was ordered by the senate to name a dictator,\r\nmaking a sort of jest of the public disaster, he named Glycias, his\r\napparitor.\r\n\r\nThe women of this family, likewise, exhibited characters equally opposed\r\nto each other.  For both the Claudias belonged to it; she, who, when the\r\nship freighted with things sacred to the Idaean Mother of the Gods [292],\r\nstuck fast in the shallows of the Tiber, got it off, by praying to the\r\nGoddess with a loud voice, “Follow me, if I am chaste;” and she also,\r\nwho, contrary to the usual practice in the case of women, was brought to\r\ntrial by the people for treason; because, when her litter was stopped by\r\na great crowd in the streets, she openly exclaimed, “I wish my brother\r\nPulcher was alive now, to lose another fleet, that Rome might be less\r\nthronged.”  Besides, it is well known, that all the Claudii, except\r\nPublius Claudius, who, to effect the banishment of Cicero, procured\r\nhimself to be adopted by a plebeian [293], and one younger than himself,\r\nwere always of the patrician party, as well as great sticklers for the\r\nhonour and power of that order; and so violent and obstinate in their\r\nopposition to the plebeians, that not one of them, even in the case of a\r\ntrial for life by the people, would ever condescend to put on mourning,\r\naccording to custom, or make any supplication to them for favour; and\r\nsome of them in their contests, have even proceeded to lay hands on the\r\ntribunes of the people.  A Vestal Virgin likewise of the family, when her\r\nbrother was resolved to have the honour of a triumph contrary to the will\r\nof the people, mounted the chariot with him, and attended him into the\r\nCapitol, that it might not be lawful for any of the tribunes to interfere\r\nand forbid it. [294]\r\n\r\nIII.  From this family Tiberius Caesar is descended; indeed both by the\r\nfather and mother’s side; by the former from Tiberius Nero, and by the\r\nlatter from Appius Pulcher, who were both sons of Appius Caecus.  He\r\nlikewise belonged to the family of the Livii, by the adoption of his\r\nmother’s grandfather into it; which family, although plebeian, made a\r\n(195) distinguished figure, having had the honour of eight consulships,\r\ntwo censorships, three triumphs, one dictatorship, and the office of\r\nmaster of the horse; and was famous for eminent men, particularly,\r\nSalinator and the Drusi.  Salinator, in his censorship [295], branded all\r\nthe tribes, for their inconstancy in having made him consul a second\r\ntime, as well as censor, although they had condemned him to a heavy fine\r\nafter his first consulship.  Drusus procured for himself and his\r\nposterity a new surname, by killing in single combat Drausus, the enemy’s\r\nchief.  He is likewise said to have recovered, when pro-praetor in the\r\nprovince of Gaul, the gold which was formerly given to the Senones, at\r\nthe siege of the Capitol, and had not, as is reported, been forced from\r\nthem by Camillus.  His great-great-grandson, who, for his extraordinary\r\nservices against the Gracchi, was styled the “Patron of the Senate,” left\r\na son, who, while plotting in a sedition of the same description, was\r\ntreacherously murdered by the opposite party. [296]\r\n\r\nIV.  But the father of Tiberius Caesar, being quaestor to Caius Caesar,\r\nand commander of his fleet in the war of Alexandria, contributed greatly\r\nto its success.  He was therefore made one of the high-priests in the\r\nroom of Publius Scipio [297]; and was sent to settle some colonies in\r\nGaul, and amongst the rest, those of Narbonne and Arles [298].  After the\r\nassassination of Caesar, however, when the rest of the senators, for fear\r\nof public disturbances; were for having the affair buried in oblivion, he\r\nproposed a resolution for rewarding those who had killed the tyrant.\r\nHaving filled the office of praetor [299], and at the end of the year a\r\ndisturbance breaking out amongst the triumviri, he kept the badges of his\r\noffice beyond the legal time; and following Lucius Antonius the consul,\r\nbrother of the triumvir, to Perusia [300], though the rest submitted, yet\r\nhe himself continued firm to the party, and escaped first to Praeneste,\r\nand then to Naples; whence, having in vain invited the slaves to liberty,\r\nhe fled over to Sicily.  But resenting (196) his not being immediately\r\nadmitted into the presence of Sextus Pompey, and being also prohibited\r\nthe use of the fasces, he went over into Achaia to Mark Antony; with\r\nwhom, upon a reconciliation soon after brought about amongst the several\r\ncontending parties, he returned to Rome; and, at the request of Augustus,\r\ngave up to him his wife Livia Drusilla, although she was then big with\r\nchild, and had before borne him a son.  He died not long after; leaving\r\nbehind him two sons, Tiberius and Drusus Nero.\r\n\r\nV.  Some have imagined that Tiberius was born at Fundi, but there is only\r\nthis trifling foundation for the conjecture, that his mother’s\r\ngrandmother was of Fundi, and that the image of Good Fortune was, by a\r\ndecree of the senate, erected in a public place in that town.  But\r\naccording to the greatest number of writers, and those too of the best\r\nauthority, he was born at Rome, in the Palatine quarter, upon the\r\nsixteenth of the calends of December [16th Nov.], when Marcus Aemilius\r\nLepidus was second time consul, with Lucius Munatius Plancus [301], after\r\nthe battle of Philippi; for so it is registered in the calendar, and the\r\npublic acts.  According to some, however, he was born the preceding year,\r\nin the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa; and others say, in the year\r\nfollowing, during the consulship of Servilius Isauricus and Antony.\r\n\r\nVI.  His infancy and childhood were spent in the midst of danger and\r\ntrouble; for he accompanied his parents everywhere in their flight, and\r\ntwice at Naples nearly betrayed them by his crying, when they were\r\nprivately hastening to a ship, as the enemy rushed into the town; once,\r\nwhen he was snatched from his nurse’s breast, and again, from his\r\nmother’s bosom, by some of the company, who on the sudden emergency\r\nwished to relieve the women of their burden.  Being carried through\r\nSicily and Achaia, and entrusted for some time to the care of the\r\nLacedaemonians, who were under the protection of the Claudian family,\r\nupon his departure thence when travelling by night, he ran the hazard of\r\nhis life, by a fire which, suddenly bursting out of a wood on all sides,\r\nsurrounded the whole party so closely, that part of Livia’s dress and\r\nhair was burnt.  The presents which were made him (197) by Pompeia,\r\nsister to Sextus Pompey, in Sicily, namely, a cloak, with a clasp, and\r\nbullae of gold, are still in existence, and shewn at Baiae to this day.\r\nAfter his return to the city, being adopted by Marcus Gallius, a senator,\r\nin his will, he took possession of the estate; but soon afterwards\r\ndeclined the use of his name, because Gallius had been of the party\r\nopposed to Augustus.  When only nine years of age, he pronounced a\r\nfuneral oration in praise of his father upon the rostra; and afterwards,\r\nwhen he had nearly attained the age of manhood, he attended the chariot\r\nof Augustus, in his triumph for the victory at Actium, riding on the\r\nleft-hand horse, whilst Marcellus, Octavia’s son, rode that on the right.\r\nHe likewise presided at the games celebrated on account of that victory;\r\nand in the Trojan games intermixed with the Circensian, he commanded a\r\ntroop of the biggest boys.\r\n\r\nVII.  After assuming the manly habit, he spent his youth, and the rest of\r\nhis life until he succeeded to the government, in the following manner:\r\nhe gave the people an entertainment of gladiators, in memory of his\r\nfather, and another for his grandfather Drusus, at different times and in\r\ndifferent places: the first in the forum, the second in the amphitheatre;\r\nsome gladiators who had been honourably discharged, being induced to\r\nengage again, by a reward of a hundred thousand sesterces.  He likewise\r\nexhibited public sports, at which he was not present himself.  All these\r\nhe performed with great magnificence, at the expense of his mother and\r\nfather-in-law.  He married Agrippina, the daughter of Marcus Agrippa, and\r\ngrand-daughter of Caecilius Atticus, a Roman knight, the same person to\r\nwhom Cicero has addressed so many epistles.  After having by her his son\r\nDrusus, he was obliged to part with her [302], though she retained his\r\naffection, and was again pregnant, to make way for marrying Augustus’s\r\ndaughter Julia.  But this he did with extreme reluctance; for, besides\r\nhaving the warmest attachment to Agrippina, he was disgusted with the\r\nconduct of Julia, who had made indecent advances to him during the\r\nlifetime of her former husband; and that she was a woman of loose\r\ncharacter, was the general opinion.  At divorcing Agrippina he felt the\r\ndeepest regret; and upon meeting her afterwards, (198) he looked after\r\nher with eyes so passionately expressive of affection, that care was\r\ntaken she should never again come in his sight.  At first, however, he\r\nlived quietly and happily with Julia; but a rupture soon ensued, which\r\nbecame so violent, that after the loss of their son, the pledge of their\r\nunion, who was born at Aquileia and died in infancy [303], he never would\r\nsleep with her more.  He lost his brother Drusus in Germany, and brought\r\nhis body to Rome, travelling all the way on foot before it.\r\n\r\nVIII.  When he first applied himself to civil affairs, he defended the\r\nseveral causes of king Archelaus, the Trallians, and the Thessalians,\r\nbefore Augustus, who sat as judge at the trials.  He addressed the senate\r\non behalf of the Laodiceans, the Thyatireans, and Chians, who had\r\nsuffered greatly by an earthquake, and implored relief from Rome.  He\r\nprosecuted Fannius Caepio, who had been engaged in a conspiracy with\r\nVarro Muraena against Augustus, and procured sentence of condemnation\r\nagainst him.  Amidst all this, he had besides to superintend two\r\ndepartments of the administration, that of supplying the city with corn,\r\nwhich was then very scarce, and that of clearing the houses of correction\r\n[304] throughout Italy, the masters of which had fallen under the odious\r\nsuspicion of seizing and keeping confined, not only travellers, but those\r\nwhom the fear of being obliged to serve in the army had driven to seek\r\nrefuge in such places.\r\n\r\nIX.  He made his first campaign, as a military tribune, in the Cantabrian\r\nwar [305].  Afterwards he led an army into the East [306], where he\r\nrestored the kingdom of Armenia to Tigranes; and seated on a tribunal,\r\nput a crown upon his head.  He likewise recovered from the Parthians the\r\nstandards which they had taken from Crassus.  He next governed, for\r\nnearly a year, the province of Gallia Comata, which was then in great\r\ndisorder, on account of the incursions of the barbarians, and the feuds\r\nof the chiefs.  He afterwards commanded in the several wars against the\r\nRhaetians, Vindelicians, Pannonians, and Germans.  In the Rhaetian and\r\nVindelician wars, he subdued the nations in the Alps; and in the\r\nPannonian wars the Bruci, and (199) the Dalmatians.  In the German war,\r\nhe transplanted into Gaul forty thousand of the enemy who had submitted,\r\nand assigned them lands near the banks of the Rhine.  For these actions,\r\nhe entered the city with an ovation, but riding in a chariot, and is said\r\nby some to have been the first that ever was honoured with this\r\ndistinction.  He filled early the principal offices of state; and passed\r\nthrough the quaestorship [307], praetorship [308], and consulate [309]\r\nalmost successively.  After some interval, he was chosen consul a second\r\ntime, and held the tribunitian authority during five years.\r\n\r\nX.  Surrounded by all this prosperity, in the prime of life and in\r\nexcellent health, he suddenly formed the resolution of withdrawing to a\r\ngreater distance from Rome [310].  It is uncertain whether this was the\r\nresult of disgust for his wife, whom he neither durst accuse nor divorce,\r\nand the connection with whom became every day more intolerable; or to\r\nprevent that indifference towards him, which his constant residence in\r\nthe city might produce; or in the hope of supporting and improving by\r\nabsence his authority in the state, if the public should have occasion\r\nfor his service.  Some are of opinion, that as Augustus’s sons were now\r\ngrown up to years of maturity, he voluntarily relinquished the possession\r\nhe had long enjoyed of the second place in the government, as Agrippa had\r\ndone before him; who, when M. Marcellus was advanced to public offices,\r\nretired to Mitylene, that he might not seem to stand in the way of his\r\npromotion, or in any respect lessen him by his presence.  The same reason\r\nlikewise Tiberius gave afterwards for his retirement; but his pretext at\r\nthis time was, that he was satiated with honours, and desirous of being\r\nrelieved from the fatigue of business; requesting therefore that he might\r\nhave leave to withdraw.  And neither the earnest entreaties of his\r\nmother, nor the complaint of his father-in-law made even in the senate,\r\nthat he was deserted by him, could prevail upon him to alter his\r\nresolution.  Upon their persisting in the design of detaining him, he\r\nrefused to take any sustenance for four days together.  At last, having\r\nobtained permission, leaving his wife and son at Rome, he proceeded (200)\r\nto Ostia [311], without exchanging a word with those who attended him,\r\nand having embraced but very few persons at parting.\r\n\r\nXI.  From Ostia, journeying along the coast of Campania, he halted awhile\r\non receiving intelligence of Augustus’s being taken ill, but this giving\r\nrise to a rumour that he stayed with a view to something extraordinary,\r\nhe sailed with the wind almost full against him, and arrived at Rhodes,\r\nhaving been struck with the pleasantness and healthiness of the island at\r\nthe time of his landing therein his return from Armenia.  Here contenting\r\nhimself with a small house, and a villa not much larger, near the town,\r\nhe led entirely a private life, taking his walks sometimes about the\r\nGymnasia [312], without any lictor or other attendant, and returning the\r\ncivilities of the Greeks with almost as much complaisance as if he had\r\nbeen upon a level with them.  One morning, in settling the course of his\r\ndaily excursion, he happened to say, that he should visit all the sick\r\npeople in the town.  This being not rightly understood by those about\r\nhim, the sick were brought into a public portico, and ranged in order,\r\naccording to their several distempers.  Being extremely embarrassed by\r\nthis unexpected occurrence, he was for some time irresolute how he should\r\nact; but at last he determined to go round them all, and make an apology\r\nfor the mistake even to the meanest amongst them, and such as were\r\nentirely unknown to him.  One instance only is mentioned, in which he\r\nappeared to exercise his tribunitian authority.  Being a constant\r\nattendant upon the schools and lecture-rooms of the professors of the\r\nliberal arts, on occasion of a quarrel amongst the wrangling (201)\r\nsophists, in which he interposed to reconcile them, some person took the\r\nliberty to abuse him as an intruder, and partial in the affair.  Upon\r\nthis, withdrawing privately home, he suddenly returned attended by his\r\nofficers, and summoning his accuser before his tribunal, by a public\r\ncrier, ordered him to be taken to prison.  Afterwards he received tidings\r\nthat his wife Julia had been condemned for her lewdness and adultery, and\r\nthat a bill of divorce had been sent to her in his name, by the authority\r\nof Augustus.  Though he secretly rejoiced at this intelligence, he\r\nthought it incumbent upon him, in point of decency, to interpose in her\r\nbehalf by frequent letters to Augustus, and to allow her to retain the\r\npresents which he had made her, notwithstanding the little regard she\r\nmerited from him.  When the period of his tribunitian authority expired\r\n[313], declaring at last that he had no other object in his retirement\r\nthan to avoid all suspicion of rivalship with Caius and Lucius, he\r\npetitioned that, since he was now secure in that respect, as they were\r\ncome to the age of manhood, and would easily maintain themselves in\r\npossession of the second place in the state, he might be permitted to\r\nvisit his friends, whom he was very desirous of seeing.  But his request\r\nwas denied; and he was advised to lay aside all concern for his friends,\r\nwhom he had been so eager to greet.\r\n\r\nXII.  He therefore continued at Rhodes much against his will, obtaining,\r\nwith difficulty, through his mother, the title of Augustus’s lieutenant,\r\nto cover his disgrace.  He thenceforth lived, however, not only as a\r\nprivate person, but as one suspected and under apprehension, retiring\r\ninto the interior of the country, and avoiding the visits of those who\r\nsailed that way, which were very frequent; for no one passed to take\r\ncommand of an army, or the government of a province, without touching at\r\nRhodes.  But there were fresh reasons for increased anxiety.  For\r\ncrossing over to Samos, on a visit to his step-son Caius, who had been\r\nappointed governor of the East, he found him prepossessed against him, by\r\nthe insinuations of Marcus Lollius, his companion and director.  He\r\nlikewise fell under suspicion of sending by some centurions who had been\r\npromoted by himself, upon their return to the camp after a furlough,\r\nmysterious messages to several persons there, intended, apparently, to\r\n(202) tamper with them for a revolt.  This jealousy respecting his\r\ndesigns being intimated to him by Augustus, he begged repeatedly that\r\nsome person of any of the three Orders might be placed as a spy upon him\r\nin every thing he either said or did.\r\n\r\nXIII.  He laid aside likewise his usual exercises of riding and arms; and\r\nquitting the Roman habit, made use of the Pallium and Crepida [314].  In\r\nthis condition he continued almost two years, becoming daily an object of\r\nincreasing contempt and odium; insomuch that the people of Nismes pulled\r\ndown all the images and statues of him in their town; and upon mention\r\nbeing made of him at table one of the company said to Caius, “I will sail\r\nover to Rhodes immediately, if you desire me, and bring you the head of\r\nthe exile;” for that was the appellation now given him.  Thus alarmed not\r\nonly by apprehensions, but real danger, he renewed his solicitations for\r\nleave to return; and, seconded by the most urgent supplications of his\r\nmother, he at last obtained his request; to which an accident somewhat\r\ncontributed.  Augustus had resolved to determine nothing in the affair,\r\nbut with the consent of his eldest son.  The latter was at that time out\r\nof humour with Marcus Lollius, and therefore easily disposed to be\r\nfavourable to his father-in-law.  Caius thus acquiescing, he was\r\nrecalled, but upon condition that he should take no concern whatever in\r\nthe administration of affairs.\r\n\r\nXIV.  He returned to Rome after an absence of nearly eight years [315],\r\nwith great and confident hopes of his future elevation, which he had\r\nentertained from his youth, in consequence of various prodigies and\r\npredictions.  For Livia, when pregnant with him, being anxious to\r\ndiscover, by different modes of divination, whether her offspring would\r\nbe a son, amongst others, took an egg from a hen that was sitting, and\r\nkept it warm with her own hands, and those of her maids, by turns, until\r\na fine cock-chicken, with a large comb, was hatched.  Scribonius, the\r\nastrologer, predicted great things of him when he was a mere child.  “He\r\nwill come in time,” said the prophet, “to be even a king, but without the\r\nusual badge of royal dignity;” the rule of the Caesars being as yet\r\nunknown.  When he was (203) making his first expedition, and leading his\r\narmy through Macedonia into Syria, the altars which had been formerly\r\nconsecrated at Philippi by the victorious legions, blazed suddenly with\r\nspontaneous fires.  Soon after, as he was marching to Illyricum, he\r\nstopped to consult the oracle of Geryon, near Padua; and having drawn a\r\nlot by which he was desired to throw golden tali into the fountain of\r\nAponus [316], for an answer to his inquiries, he did so, and the highest\r\nnumbers came up.  And those very tali are still to be seen at the bottom\r\nof the fountain.  A few days before his leaving Rhodes, an eagle, a bird\r\nnever before seen in that island, perched on the top of his house.  And\r\nthe day before he received intelligence of the permission granted him to\r\nreturn, as he was changing his dress, his tunic appeared to be all on\r\nfire.  He then likewise had a remarkable proof of the skill of\r\nThrasyllus, the astrologer, whom, for his proficiency in philosophical\r\nresearches, he had taken into his family.  For, upon sight of the ship\r\nwhich brought the intelligence, he said, good news was coming whereas\r\nevery thing going wrong before, and quite contrary to his predictions,\r\nTiberius had intended that very moment, when they were walking together,\r\nto throw him into the sea, as an impostor, and one to whom he had too\r\nhastily entrusted his secrets.\r\n\r\nXV.  Upon his return to Rome, having introduced his son Drusus into the\r\nforum, he immediately removed from Pompey’s house, in the Carinae, to the\r\ngardens of Mecaenas, on the Esquiline [317], and resigned himself\r\nentirely to his ease, performing only the common offices of civility in\r\nprivate life, without any preferment in the government.  But Caius and\r\nLucius being both carried off in the space of three years, he was adopted\r\nby Augustus, along with their brother Agrippa; being obliged in the first\r\nplace to adopt Germanicus, his brother’s son.  After his adoption, he\r\nnever more acted as master of a (204) family, nor exercised, in the\r\nsmallest degree, the rights which he had lost by it.  For he neither\r\ndisposed of anything in the way of gift, nor manumitted a slave; nor so\r\nmuch as received any estate left him by will, nor any legacy, without\r\nreckoning it as a part of his peculium or property held under his father.\r\nFrom that day forward, nothing was omitted that might contribute to the\r\nadvancement of his grandeur, and much more, when, upon Agrippa being\r\ndiscarded and banished, it was evident that the hope of succession rested\r\nupon him alone.\r\n\r\nXVI.  The tribunitian authority was again conferred upon him for five\r\nyears [318], and a commission given him to settle the affairs of Germany.\r\nThe ambassadors of the Parthians, after having had an audience of\r\nAugustus, were ordered to apply to him likewise in his province.  But on\r\nreceiving intelligence of an insurrection in Illyricum [319], he went\r\nover to superintend the management of that new war, which proved the most\r\nserious of all the foreign wars since the Carthaginian.  This he\r\nconducted during three years, with fifteen legions and an equal number of\r\nauxiliary forces, under great difficulties, and an extreme scarcity of\r\ncorn.  And though he was several times recalled, he nevertheless\r\npersisted; fearing lest an enemy so powerful, and so near, should fall\r\nupon the army in their retreat.  This resolution was attended with good\r\nsuccess; for he at last reduced to complete subjection all Illyricum,\r\nlying between Italy and the kingdom of Noricum, Thrace, Macedonia, the\r\nriver Danube, and the Adriatic gulf.\r\n\r\nXVII.  The glory he acquired by these successes received an increase from\r\nthe conjuncture in which they happened.  For almost about that very time\r\n[320] Quintilius Varus was cut off with three legions in Germany; and it\r\nwas generally believed that the victorious Germans would have joined the\r\nPannonians, had not the war of Illyricum been previously concluded.  A\r\ntriumph, therefore, besides many other great honours, was decreed him.\r\nSome proposed that the surname of “Pannonicus,” others that of\r\n“Invincible,” and others, of “O Pius,” should be conferred on him; but\r\nAugustus interposed, engaging for him that he would be satisfied with\r\nthat to which he would succeed at his death.  He postponed his triumph,\r\nbecause (205) the state was at that time under great affliction for the\r\ndisaster of Varus and his army.  Nevertheless, he entered the city in a\r\ntriumphal robe, crowned with laurel, and mounting a tribunal in the\r\nSepta, sat with Augustus between the two consuls, whilst the senate gave\r\ntheir attendance standing; whence, after he had saluted the people, he\r\nwas attended by them in procession to the several temples.\r\n\r\nXVIII.  Next year he went again to Germany, where finding that the defeat\r\nof Varus was occasioned by the rashness and negligence of the commander,\r\nhe thought proper to be guided in everything by the advice of a council\r\nof war; whereas, at other times, he used to follow the dictates of his\r\nown judgment, and considered himself alone as sufficiently qualified for\r\nthe direction of affairs.  He likewise used more cautions than usual.\r\nHaving to pass the Rhine, he restricted the whole convoy within certain\r\nlimits, and stationing himself on the bank of the river, would not suffer\r\nthe waggons to cross the river, until he had searched them at the\r\nwater-side, to see that they carried nothing but what was allowed or\r\nnecessary. Beyond the Rhine, such was his way of living, that he took his\r\nmeals sitting on the bare ground [321], and often passed the night without\r\na tent; and his regular orders for the day, as well as those upon sudden\r\nemergencies, he gave in writing, with this injunction, that in case of any\r\ndoubt as to the meaning of them, they should apply to him for\r\nsatisfaction, even at any hour of the night.\r\n\r\nXIX.  He maintained the strictest discipline amongst the troops; reviving\r\nmany old customs relative to punishing and degrading offenders; setting a\r\nmark of disgrace even upon the commander of a legion, for sending a few\r\nsoldiers with one of his freedmen across the river for the purpose of\r\nhunting.  Though it was his desire to leave as little as possible in the\r\npower of fortune or accident, yet he always engaged the enemy with more\r\nconfidence when, in his night-watches, the lamp failed and went out of\r\nitself; trusting, as he said, in an omen which had never failed him and\r\nhis ancestors (206) in all their commands.  But, in the midst of victory,\r\nhe was very near being assassinated by some Bructerian, who mixing with\r\nthose about him, and being discovered by his trepidation, was put to the\r\ntorture, and confessed his intended crime.\r\n\r\nXX.  After two years, he returned from Germany to the city, and\r\ncelebrated the triumph which he had deferred, attended by his\r\nlieutenants, for whom he had procured the honour of triumphal ornaments\r\n[322]. Before he turned to ascend the Capitol, he alighted from his\r\nchariot, and knelt before his father, who sat by, to superintend the\r\nsolemnity.  Bato, the Pannonian chief, he sent to Ravenna, loaded with\r\nrich presents, in gratitude for his having suffered him and his army to\r\nretire from a position in which he had so enclosed them, that they were\r\nentirely at his mercy.  He afterwards gave the people a dinner at a\r\nthousand tables, besides thirty sesterces to each man.  He likewise\r\ndedicated the temple of Concord [323], and that of Castor and Pollux,\r\nwhich had been erected out of the spoils of the war, in his own and his\r\nbrother’s name.\r\n\r\nXXI.  A law having been not long after carried by the consuls [324] for\r\nhis being appointed a colleague with Augustus in the administration of\r\nthe provinces, and in taking the census, when that was finished he went\r\ninto Illyricum [325].  But being hastily recalled during his journey, he\r\nfound Augustus alive indeed, but past all hopes of recovery, and was with\r\nhim in private a whole day.  I know, it is generally believed, that upon\r\nTiberius’s quitting the room, after their private conference, those who\r\nwere in waiting overheard Augustus say, “Ah! unhappy Roman people, to be\r\nground by the jaws of such a slow devourer!”  Nor am I ignorant of its\r\nbeing reported by some, that Augustus so openly and undisguisedly\r\ncondemned the sourness of his temper, that sometimes, upon his coming in,\r\nhe would break off any jocular conversation in which he was engaged; and\r\nthat he was only prevailed upon by the (207) importunity of his wife to\r\nadopt him; or actuated by the ambitious view of recommending his own\r\nmemory from a comparison with such a successor.  Yet I must hold to this\r\nopinion, that a prince so extremely circumspect and prudent as he was,\r\ndid nothing rashly, especially in an affair of so great importance; but\r\nthat, upon weighing the vices and virtues of Tiberius with each other, he\r\njudged the latter to preponderate; and this the rather since he swore\r\npublicly, in an assembly of the people, that “he adopted him for the\r\npublic good.”  Besides, in several of his letters, he extols him as a\r\nconsummate general, and the only security of the Roman people.  Of such\r\ndeclarations I subjoin the following instances: “Farewell, my dear\r\nTiberius, and may success attend you, whilst you are warring for me and\r\nthe Muses [326].  Farewell, my most dear, and (as I hope to prosper) most\r\ngallant man, and accomplished general.”  Again.  “The disposition of your\r\nsummer quarters?  In truth, my dear Tiberius, I do not think, that amidst\r\nso many difficulties, and with an army so little disposed for action, any\r\none could have behaved more prudently than you have done.  All those\r\nlikewise who were with you, acknowledge that this verse is applicable to\r\nyou:”\r\n\r\n    Unus homo nobis _vigilando_ restituit rem. [327]\r\n    One man by vigilance restored the state.\r\n\r\n“Whenever,” he says, “anything happens that requires more than ordinary\r\nconsideration, or I am out of humour upon any occasion, I still, by\r\nHercules! long for my dear Tiberius; and those lines of Homer frequently\r\noccur to my thoughts:”\r\n\r\n    Toutou d’ espomenoio kai ek pyros aithomenoio\r\n    Ampho nostaesuimen, epei peri oide noaesai. [328]\r\n\r\n    Bold from his prudence, I could ev’n aspire\r\n    To dare with him the burning rage of fire.\r\n\r\n“When I hear and read that you are much impaired by the (208) continued\r\nfatigues you undergo, may the gods confound me if my whole frame does not\r\ntremble!  So I beg you to spare yourself, lest, if we should hear of your\r\nbeing ill, the news prove fatal both to me and your mother, and the Roman\r\npeople should be in peril for the safety of the empire.  It matters\r\nnothing whether I be well or no, if you be not well.  I pray heaven\r\npreserve you for us, and bless you with health both now and ever, if the\r\ngods have any regard for the Roman people.”\r\n\r\nXXII.  He did not make the death of Augustus public, until he had taken\r\noff young Agrippa.  He was slain by a tribune who commanded his guard,\r\nupon reading a written order for that purpose: respecting which order, it\r\nwas then a doubt, whether Augustus left it in his last moments, to\r\nprevent any occasion of public disturbance after his decease, or Livia\r\nissued it, in the name of Augustus; and whether with the knowledge of\r\nTiberius or not.  When the tribune came to inform him that he had\r\nexecuted his command, he replied, “I commanded you no such thing, and you\r\nmust answer for it to the senate;” avoiding, as it seems, the odium of\r\nthe act for that time.  And the affair was soon buried in silence.\r\n\r\nXXIII.  Having summoned the senate to meet by virtue of his tribunitian\r\nauthority, and begun a mournful speech, he drew a deep sigh, as if unable\r\nto support himself under his affliction; and wishing that not his voice\r\nonly, but his very breath of life, might fail him, gave his speech to his\r\nson Drusus to read.  Augustus’s will was then brought in, and read by a\r\nfreedman; none of the witnesses to it being admitted, but such as were of\r\nthe senatorian order, the rest owning their hand-writing without doors.\r\nThe will began thus: “Since my ill-fortune has deprived me of my two\r\nsons, Caius and Lucius, let Tiberius Caesar be heir to two-thirds of my\r\nestate.”  These words countenanced the suspicion of those who were of\r\nopinion, that Tiberius was appointed successor more out of necessity than\r\nchoice, since Augustus could not refrain from prefacing his will in that\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nXXIV.  Though he made no scruple to assume and exercise immediately the\r\nimperial authority, by giving orders that he (209) should be attended by\r\nthe guards, who were the security and badge of the supreme power; yet he\r\naffected, by a most impudent piece of acting, to refuse it for a long\r\ntime; one while sharply reprehending his friends who entreated him to\r\naccept it, as little knowing what a monster the government was; another\r\nwhile keeping in suspense the senate, when they implored him and threw\r\nthemselves at his feet, by ambiguous answers, and a crafty kind of\r\ndissimulation; insomuch that some were out of patience, and one cried\r\nout, during the confusion, “Either let him accept it, or decline it at\r\nonce;” and a second told him to his face, “Others are slow to perform\r\nwhat they promise, but you are slow to promise what you actually\r\nperform.”  At last, as if forced to it, and complaining of the miserable\r\nand burdensome service imposed upon him, he accepted the government; not,\r\nhowever, without giving hopes of his resigning it some time or other.\r\nThe exact words he used were these: “Until the time shall come, when ye\r\nmay think it reasonable to give some rest to my old age.”\r\n\r\nXXV.  The cause of his long demur was fear of the dangers which\r\nthreatened him on all hands; insomuch that he said, “I have got a wolf\r\nby the ears.”  For a slave of Agrippa’s, Clemens by name, had drawn\r\ntogether a considerable force to revenge his master’s death; Lucius\r\nScribonius Libo, a senator of the first distinction, was secretly\r\nfomenting a rebellion; and the troops both in Illyricum and Germany were\r\nmutinous.  Both armies insisted upon high demands, particularly that\r\ntheir pay should be made equal to that of the pretorian guards.  The army\r\nin Germany absolutely refused to acknowledge a prince who was not their\r\nown choice; and urged, with all possible importunity, Germanicus [329],\r\nwho commanded them, to take the government on himself, though he\r\nobstinately refused it.  It was Tiberius’s apprehension from this\r\nquarter, which made him request the senate to assign him some part only\r\nin the administration, such as they should judge proper, since no man\r\ncould be sufficient for the whole, without one or more to assist him.  He\r\npretended likewise to be in a bad state of health, that Germanicus might\r\nthe more patiently wait in hopes of speedily succeeding him, or at least\r\nof being (210) admitted to be a colleague in the government.  When the\r\nmutinies in the armies were suppressed, he got Clemens into his hands by\r\nstratagem.  That he might not begin his reign by an act of severity, he\r\ndid not call Libo to an account before the senate until his second year,\r\nbeing content, in the mean time, with taking proper precautions for his\r\nown security.  For upon Libo’s attending a sacrifice amongst the\r\nhigh-priests, instead of the usual knife, he ordered one of lead to be\r\ngiven him; and when he desired a private conference with him, he would not\r\ngrant his request, but on condition that his son Drusus should be present;\r\nand as they walked together, he held him fast by the right hand, under the\r\npretence of leaning upon him, until the conversation was over.\r\n\r\nXXVI.  When he was delivered from his apprehensions, his behaviour at\r\nfirst was unassuming, and he did not carry himself much above the level\r\nof a private person; and of the many and great honours offered him, he\r\naccepted but few, and such as were very moderate.  His birth-day, which\r\nhappened to fall at the time of the Plebeian Circensian games, he with\r\ndifficulty suffered to be honoured with the addition of only a single\r\nchariot, drawn by two horses.  He forbad temples, flamens, or priests to\r\nbe appointed for him, as likewise the erection of any statues or effigies\r\nfor him, without his permission; and this he granted only on condition\r\nthat they should not be placed amongst the images of the gods, but only\r\namongst the ornaments of houses.  He also interposed to prevent the\r\nsenate from swearing to maintain his acts; and the month of September\r\nfrom being called Tiberius, and October being named after Livia.  The\r\npraenomen likewise of EMPEROR, with the cognomen of FATHER OF HIS\r\nCOUNTRY, and a civic crown in the vestibule of his house, he would not\r\naccept.  He never used the name of AUGUSTUS, although he inherited it, in\r\nany of his letters, excepting those addressed to kings and princes.  Nor\r\nhad he more than three consulships; one for a few days, another for three\r\nmonths, and a third, during his absence from the city, until the ides\r\n[fifteenth] of May.\r\n\r\nXXVII.  He had such an aversion to flattery, that he would never suffer\r\nany senator to approach his litter, as he passed the streets in it,\r\neither to pay him a civility, or upon business.  (211) And when a man of\r\nconsular rank, in begging his pardon for some offence he had given him,\r\nattempted to fall at his feet, he started from him in such haste, that he\r\nstumbled and fell.  If any compliment was paid him, either in\r\nconversation or a set speech, he would not scruple to interrupt and\r\nreprimand the party, and alter what he had said.  Being once called\r\n“lord,” [330] by some person, he desired that he might no more be\r\naffronted in that manner.  When another, to excite veneration, called his\r\noccupations “sacred,” and a third had expressed himself thus: “By your\r\nauthority I have waited upon the senate,” he obliged them to change their\r\nphrases; in one of them adopting persuasion, instead of “authority,” and\r\nin the other, laborious, instead of “sacred.”\r\n\r\nXXVIII.  He remained unmoved at all the aspersions, scandalous reports,\r\nand lampoons, which were spread against him or his relations; declaring,\r\n“In a free state, both the tongue and the mind ought to be free.”  Upon\r\nthe senate’s desiring that some notice might be taken of those offences,\r\nand the persons charged with them, he replied, “We have not so much time\r\nupon our hands, that we ought to involve ourselves in more business.  If\r\nyou once make an opening [331] for such proceedings, you will soon have\r\nnothing else to do.  All private quarrels will be brought before you\r\nunder that pretence.”  There is also on record another sentence used by\r\nhim in the senate, which is far from assuming: “If he speaks otherwise of\r\nme, I shall take care to behave in such a manner, as to be able to give a\r\ngood account both of my words and actions; and if he persists, I shall\r\nhate him in my turn.”\r\n\r\nXXIX.  These things were so much the more remarkable in him, because, in\r\nthe respect he paid to individuals, or the whole body of the senate, he\r\nwent beyond all bounds.  Upon his differing with Quintus Haterius in the\r\nsenate-house, “Pardon me, sir,” he said, “I beseech you, if I shall, as a\r\nsenator, speak my mind very freely in opposition to you.”  Afterwards,\r\naddressing the senate in general, he said: “Conscript Fathers, I have\r\noften said it both now and at other times, that a good (212) and useful\r\nprince, whom you have invested with so great and absolute power, ought to\r\nbe a slave to the senate, to the whole body of the people, and often to\r\nindividuals likewise: nor am I sorry that I have said it.  I have always\r\nfound you good, kind, and indulgent masters, and still find you so.”\r\n\r\nXXX.  He likewise introduced a certain show of liberty, by preserving to\r\nthe senate and magistrates their former majesty and power.  All affairs,\r\nwhether of great or small importance, public or private, were laid before\r\nthe senate.  Taxes and monopolies, the erecting or repairing edifices,\r\nlevying and disbanding soldiers, the disposal of the legions and\r\nauxiliary forces in the provinces, the appointment of generals for the\r\nmanagement of extraordinary wars, and the answers to letters from foreign\r\nprinces, were all submitted to the senate.  He compelled the commander of\r\na troop of horse, who was accused of robbery attended with violence, to\r\nplead his cause before the senate.  He never entered the senate-house but\r\nunattended; and being once brought thither in a litter, because he was\r\nindisposed, he dismissed his attendants at the door.\r\n\r\nXXXI.  When some decrees were made contrary to his opinion, he did not\r\neven make any complaint.  And though he thought that no magistrates after\r\ntheir nomination should be allowed to absent themselves from the city,\r\nbut reside in it constantly, to receive their honours in person, a\r\npraetor-elect obtained liberty to depart under the honorary title of a\r\nlegate at large.  Again, when he proposed to the senate, that the\r\nTrebians might have leave granted them to divert some money which had\r\nbeen left them by will for the purpose of building a new theatre, to that\r\nof making a road, he could not prevail to have the will of the testator\r\nset aside.  And when, upon a division of the house, he went over to the\r\nminority, nobody followed him.  All other things of a public nature were\r\nlikewise transacted by the magistrates, and in the usual forms; the\r\nauthority of the consuls remaining so great, that some ambassadors from\r\nAfrica applied to them, and complained, that they could not have their\r\nbusiness dispatched by Caesar, to whom they had been sent.  And no\r\nwonder; since it was observed that he used to rise up as the consuls\r\napproached, and give them the way.\r\n\r\n(213) XXXII.  He reprimanded some persons of consular rank in command of\r\narmies, for not writing to the senate an account of their proceedings,\r\nand for consulting him about the distribution of military rewards; as if\r\nthey themselves had not a right to bestow them as they judged proper.  He\r\ncommended a praetor, who, on entering office, revived an old custom of\r\ncelebrating the memory of his ancestors, in a speech to the people.  He\r\nattended the corpses of some persons of distinction to the funeral pile.\r\nHe displayed the same moderation with regard to persons and things of\r\ninferior consideration.  The magistrates of Rhodes, having dispatched to\r\nhim a letter on public business, which was not subscribed, he sent for\r\nthem, and without giving them so much as one harsh word, desired them to\r\nsubscribe it, and so dismissed them.  Diogenes, the grammarian, who used\r\nto hold public disquisitions, at Rhodes every sabbath-day, once refused\r\nhim admittance upon his coming to hear him out of course, and sent him a\r\nmessage by a servant, postponing his admission until the next seventh\r\nday.  Diogenes afterwards coming to Rome, and waiting at his door to be\r\nallowed to pay his respects to him, he sent him word to come again at the\r\nend of seven years.  To some governors, who advised him to load the\r\nprovinces with taxes, he answered, “It is the part of a good shepherd to\r\nshear, not flay, his sheep.”\r\n\r\nXXXIII.  He assumed the sovereignty [332] by slow degrees, and exercised\r\nit for a long time with great variety of conduct, though generally with a\r\ndue regard to the public good.  At first he only interposed to prevent\r\nill management.  Accordingly, he rescinded some decrees of the senate;\r\nand when the magistrates sat for the administration of justice, he\r\nfrequently offered his service as assessor, either taking his place\r\npromiscuously amongst them, or seating himself in a corner of the\r\ntribunal.  If a rumour prevailed, that any person under prosecution was\r\nlikely to be acquitted by his interest, he would suddenly make his\r\nappearance, and from the floor of the court, (214) or the praetor’s\r\nbench, remind the judges of the laws, and of their oaths, and the nature\r\nof the charge brought before them, he likewise took upon himself the\r\ncorrection of public morals, where they tended to decay, either through\r\nneglect, or evil custom.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.  He reduced the expense of the plays and public spectacles, by\r\ndiminishing the allowances to actors, and curtailing the number of\r\ngladiators.  He made grievous complaints to the senate, that the price of\r\nCorinthian vessels was become enormous, and that three mullets had been\r\nsold for thirty thousand sesterces: upon which he proposed that a new\r\nsumptuary law should be enacted; that the butchers and other dealers in\r\nviands should be subject to an assize, fixed by the senate yearly; and\r\nthe aediles commissioned to restrain eating-houses and taverns, so far as\r\nnot even to permit the sale of any kind of pastry.  And to encourage\r\nfrugality in the public by his own example, he would often, at his solemn\r\nfeasts, have at his tables victuals which had been served up the day\r\nbefore, and were partly eaten, and half a boar, affirming, “It has all\r\nthe same good bits that the whole had.”  He published an edict against\r\nthe practice of people’s kissing each other when they met; and would not\r\nallow new-year’s gifts [333] to be presented after the calends [the\r\nfirst] of January was passed.  He had been in the habit of returning\r\nthese offerings four-fold, and making them with his own hand; but being\r\nannoyed by the continual interruption to which he was exposed during the\r\nwhole month, by those who had not the opportunity of attending him on the\r\nfestival, he returned none after that day.\r\n\r\nXXXV.  Married women guilty of adultery, though not prosecuted publicly,\r\nhe authorised the nearest relations to punish by agreement among\r\nthemselves, according to ancient custom.  He discharged a Roman knight\r\nfrom the obligation of an oath he had taken, never to turn away his wife;\r\nand allowed him to divorce her, upon her being caught in criminal\r\nintercourse with her son-in-law.  Women of ill-fame, divesting themselves\r\nof the rights and dignity of matrons, had now begun a practice of\r\nprofessing themselves prostitutes, to avoid (215) the punishment of the\r\nlaws; and the most profligate young men of the senatorian and equestrian\r\norders, to secure themselves against a decree of the senate, which\r\nprohibited their performing on the stage, or in the amphitheatre,\r\nvoluntarily subjected themselves to an infamous sentence, by which they\r\nwere degraded.  All those he banished, that none for the future might\r\nevade by such artifices the intention and efficacy of the law.  He\r\nstripped a senator of the broad stripes on his robe, upon information of\r\nhis having removed to his gardens before the calends [the first] of July,\r\nin order that he might afterwards hire a house cheaper in the city.  He\r\nlikewise dismissed another from the office of quaestor, for repudiating,\r\nthe day after he had been lucky in drawing his lot, a wife whom he had\r\nmarried only the day before.\r\n\r\nXXXVI.  He suppressed all foreign religions, and the Egyptian [334] and\r\nJewish rites, obliging those who practised that kind of superstition, to\r\nburn their vestments, and all their sacred utensils.  He distributed the\r\nJewish youths, under the pretence of military service, among the\r\nprovinces noted for an unhealthy climate; and dismissed from the city all\r\nthe rest of that nation as well as those who were proselytes to that\r\nreligion [335], under pain of slavery for life, unless they complied.  He\r\nalso expelled the astrologers; but upon their suing for pardon, and\r\npromising to renounce their profession, he revoked his decree.\r\n\r\nXXXVII.  But, above all things, he was careful to keep the (216) public\r\npeace against robbers, burglars, and those who were disaffected to the\r\ngovernment.  He therefore increased the number of military stations\r\nthroughout Italy; and formed a camp at Rome for the pretorian cohorts,\r\nwhich, till then, had been quartered in the city.  He suppressed with\r\ngreat severity all tumults of the people on their first breaking out; and\r\ntook every precaution to prevent them.  Some persons having been killed\r\nin a quarrel which happened in the theatre, he banished the leaders of\r\nthe parties, and the players about whom the disturbance had arisen; nor\r\ncould all the entreaties of the people afterwards prevail upon him to\r\nrecall them [336].  The people of Pollentia having refused to permit the\r\nremoval of the corpse of a centurion of the first rank from the forum,\r\nuntil they had extorted from his heirs a sum of money for a public\r\nexhibition of gladiators, he detached a cohort from the city, and another\r\nfrom the kingdom of Cottius [337]; who concealing the cause of their\r\nmarch, entered the town by different gates, with their arms suddenly\r\ndisplayed, and trumpets sounding; and having seized the greatest part of\r\nthe people, and the magistrates, they were imprisoned for life.  He\r\nabolished every where the privileges of all places of refuge.  The\r\nCyzicenians having committed an outrage upon some Romans, he deprived\r\nthem of the liberty they had obtained for their good services in the\r\nMithridatic war.  Disturbances from foreign enemies he quelled by his\r\nlieutenants, without ever going against them in person; nor would he even\r\nemploy his lieutenants, but with much reluctance, and when it was\r\nabsolutely necessary.  Princes who were ill-affected towards him, he kept\r\nin subjection, more by menaces and remonstrances, than by force of arms.\r\nSome whom he induced to come to him by fair words and promises, he never\r\nwould permit to return home; as Maraboduus the German, Thrascypolis the\r\n(217) Thracian, and Archelaus the Cappadocian, whose kingdom he even\r\nreduced into the form of a province.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.  He never set foot outside the gates of Rome, for two years\r\ntogether, from the time he assumed the supreme power; and after that\r\nperiod, went no farther from the city than to some of the neighbouring\r\ntowns; his farthest excursion being to Antium [338], and that but very\r\nseldom, and for a few days; though he often gave out that he would visit\r\nthe provinces and armies, and made preparations for it almost every year,\r\nby taking up carriages, and ordering provisions for his retinue in the\r\nmunicipia and colonies.  At last he suffered vows to be put up for his\r\ngood journey and safe return, insomuch that he was called jocosely by the\r\nname of Callipides, who is famous in a Greek proverb, for being in a\r\ngreat hurry to go forward, but without ever advancing a cubit.\r\n\r\nXXXIX.  But after the loss of his two sons, of whom Germanicus died in\r\nSyria, and Drusus at Rome, he withdrew into Campania [339]; at which time\r\nopinion and conversation were almost general, that he never would return,\r\nand would die soon.  And both nearly turned out to be true.  For indeed\r\nhe never more came to Rome; and a few days after leaving it, when he was\r\nat a villa of his called the Cave, near Terracina [340], during supper a\r\ngreat many huge stones fell from above, which killed several of the\r\nguests and attendants; but he almost hopelessly escaped.\r\n\r\nXL.  After he had gone round Campania, and dedicated the capitol at\r\nCapua, and a temple to Augustus at Nola [341], which he made the pretext\r\nof his journey, he retired to Capri; being (218) greatly delighted with\r\nthe island, because it was accessible only by a narrow beach, being on\r\nall sides surrounded with rugged cliffs, of a stupendous height, and by a\r\ndeep sea.  But immediately, the people of Rome being extremely clamorous\r\nfor his return, on account of a disaster at Fidenae [342], where upwards\r\nof twenty thousand persons had been killed by the fall of the\r\namphitheatre, during a public spectacle of gladiators, he crossed over\r\nagain to the continent, and gave all people free access to him; so much\r\nthe more, because, at his departure from the city, he had caused it to be\r\nproclaimed that no one should address him, and had declined admitting any\r\npersons to his presence, on the journey.\r\n\r\nXLI.  Returning to the island, he so far abandoned all care of the\r\ngovernment, that he never filled up the decuriae of the knights, never\r\nchanged any military tribunes or prefects, or governors of provinces, and\r\nkept Spain and Syria for several years without any consular lieutenants.\r\nHe likewise suffered Armenia to be seized by the Parthians, Moesia by the\r\nDacians and Sarmatians, and Gaul to be ravaged by the Germans; to the\r\ngreat disgrace, and no less danger, of the empire.\r\n\r\nXLII.  But having now the advantage of privacy, and being remote from the\r\nobservation of the people of Rome, he abandoned himself to all the\r\nvicious propensities which he had long but imperfectly concealed, and of\r\nwhich I shall here give a particular account from the beginning.  While a\r\nyoung soldier in the camp, he was so remarkable for his excessive\r\ninclination to wine, that, for Tiberius, they called him Biberius; for\r\nClaudius, Caldius; and for Nero, Mero.  And after he succeeded to the\r\nempire, and was invested with the office of reforming the morality of the\r\npeople, he spent a whole night and two days together in feasting and\r\ndrinking with Pomponius Flaccus and Lucius Piso; to one of whom he\r\nimmediately gave the province of Syria, and to the other the prefecture\r\nof the city; declaring them, in his letters-patent, to be “very pleasant\r\ncompanions, and friends fit for all occasions.”  He made an appointment\r\nto sup with Sestius Gallus, a lewd and prodigal old fellow, who had been\r\ndisgraced by Augustus, and reprimanded by himself but a few days before\r\nin the senate-house; upon condition that he should not recede in the\r\nleast from his usual method of entertainment, and that they should be\r\nattended at table by naked girls.  He preferred a very obscure candidate\r\nfor the quaestorship, before the most noble competitors, only for taking\r\noff, in pledging him at table, an amphora of wine at a draught [343].  He\r\npresented Asellius Sabinus with two hundred thousand sesterces, for\r\nwriting a dialogue, in the way of dispute, betwixt the truffle and the\r\nfig-pecker, the oyster and the thrush.  He likewise instituted a new\r\noffice to administer to his voluptuousness, to which he appointed Titus\r\nCaesonius Priscus, a Roman knight.\r\n\r\nXLIII.  In his retreat at Capri [344], he also contrived an apartment\r\ncontaining couches, and adapted to the secret practice of abominable\r\nlewdness, where he entertained companies of girls and catamites, and\r\nassembled from all quarters inventors of unnatural copulations, whom he\r\ncalled Spintriae, who defiled one another in his presence, to inflame by\r\nthe exhibition the languid appetite.  He had several chambers set round\r\nwith pictures and statues in the most lascivious attitudes, and furnished\r\nwith the books of Elephantis, that none might want a pattern for the\r\nexecution of any lewd project that was prescribed him.  He likewise\r\ncontrived recesses in woods and groves for the gratification of lust,\r\nwhere young persons of both sexes prostituted themselves in caves and\r\nhollow rocks, in the disguise of little Pans and Nymphs [345].  So that\r\nhe was publicly and commonly called, by an abuse of the name of the\r\nisland, Caprineus. [346]\r\n\r\nXLIV.  But he was still more infamous, if possible, for an (220)\r\nabomination not fit to be mentioned or heard, much less credited. [347]\r\n------------------When a picture, painted by Parrhasius, in which the\r\nartist had represented Atalanta in the act of submitting to Meleager’s\r\nlust in a most unnatural way, was bequeathed to him, with this proviso,\r\nthat if the subject was offensive to him, he might receive in lieu of it\r\na million of sesterces, he not only chose the picture, but hung it up in\r\nhis bed-chamber.  It is also reported that, during a sacrifice, he was so\r\ncaptivated with the form of a youth who held a censer, that, before the\r\nreligious rites were well over, he took him aside and abused him; as also\r\na brother of his who had been playing the flute; and soon afterwards\r\nbroke the legs of both of them, for upbraiding one another with their\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nXLV.  How much he was guilty of a most foul intercourse with women even\r\nof the first quality [348], appeared very plainly by the death of one\r\nMallonia, who, being brought to his bed, but resolutely refusing to\r\ncomply with his lust, he gave her up to the common informers.  Even when\r\nshe was upon her trial, he frequently called out to her, and asked her,\r\n“Do you repent?” until she, quitting the court, went home, and stabbed\r\nherself; openly upbraiding the vile old lecher for his gross obscenity\r\n[349]. Hence there was an allusion to him in a farce, which was acted at\r\nthe next public sports, and was received with great applause, and became\r\na common topic of ridicule [350]: that the old goat--------\r\n\r\nXLVI.  He was so niggardly and covetous, that he never allowed to his\r\nattendants, in his travels and expeditions, any salary, but their diet\r\nonly.  Once, indeed, he treated them liberally, at the instigation of his\r\nstep-father, when, dividing them into three classes, according to their\r\nrank, he gave the (221) first six, the second four, and the third two,\r\nhundred thousand sesterces, which last class he called not friends, but\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\nXLVII.  During the whole time of his government, he never erected any\r\nnoble edifice; for the only things he did undertake, namely, building the\r\ntemple of Augustus, and restoring Pompey’s Theatre, he left at last,\r\nafter many years, unfinished.  Nor did he ever entertain the people with\r\npublic spectacles; and he was seldom present at those which were given by\r\nothers, lest any thing of that kind should be requested of him;\r\nespecially after he was obliged to give freedom to the comedian Actius.\r\nHaving relieved the poverty of a few senators, to avoid further demands,\r\nhe declared that he should for the future assist none, but those who gave\r\nthe senate full satisfaction as to the cause of their necessity.  Upon\r\nthis, most of the needy senators, from modesty and shame, declined\r\ntroubling him.  Amongst these was Hortalus, grandson to the celebrated\r\norator Quintus Hortensius, who [marrying], by the persuasion of Augustus,\r\nhad brought up four children upon a very small estate.\r\n\r\nXLVIII.  He displayed only two instances of public munificence.  One was\r\nan offer to lend gratis, for three years, a hundred millions of sesterces\r\nto those who wanted to borrow; and the other, when, some large houses\r\nbeing burnt down upon Mount Caelius, he indemnified the owners.  To the\r\nformer of these he was compelled by the clamours of the people, in a\r\ngreat scarcity of money, when he had ratified a decree of the senate\r\nobliging all money-lenders to advance two-thirds of their capital on\r\nland, and the debtors to pay off at once the same proportion of their\r\ndebts, and it was found insufficient to remedy the grievance.  The other\r\nhe did to alleviate in some degree the pressure of the times.  But his\r\nbenefaction to the sufferers by fire, he estimated at so high a rate,\r\nthat he ordered the Caelian Hill to be called, in future, the Augustan.\r\nTo the soldiery, after doubling the legacy left them by Augustus, he\r\nnever gave any thing, except a thousand denarii a man to the pretorian\r\nguards, for not joining the party of Sejanus; and some presents to the\r\nlegions in Syria, because they alone had not paid reverence to the\r\neffigies of Sejanus among their standards.  He seldom gave discharges to\r\nthe veteran soldiers, calculating (222) on their deaths from advanced\r\nage, and on what would be saved by thus getting rid of them, in the way\r\nof rewards or pensions.  Nor did he ever relieve the provinces by any act\r\nof generosity, excepting Asia, where some cities had been destroyed by an\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\nXLIX.  In the course of a very short time, he turned his mind to sheer\r\nrobbery.  It is certain that Cneius Lentulus, the augur, a man of vast\r\nestate, was so terrified and worried by his threats and importunities,\r\nthat he was obliged to make him his heir; and that Lepida, a lady of a\r\nvery noble family, was condemned by him, in order to gratify Quirinus, a\r\nman of consular rank, extremely rich, and childless, who had divorced her\r\ntwenty years before, and now charged her with an old design to poison\r\nhim.  Several persons, likewise, of the first distinction in Gaul, Spain,\r\nSyria, and Greece, had their estates confiscated upon such despicably\r\ntrifling and shameless pretences, that against some of them no other\r\ncharge was preferred, than that they held large sums of ready money as\r\npart of their property.  Old immunities, the rights of mining, and of\r\nlevying tolls, were taken from several cities and private persons.  And\r\nVonones, king of the Parthians, who had been driven out of his dominions\r\nby his own subjects, and fled to Antioch with a vast treasure, claiming\r\nthe protection of the Roman people, his allies, was treacherously robbed\r\nof all his money, and afterwards murdered.\r\n\r\nL.  He first manifested hatred towards his own relations in the case of\r\nhis brother Drusus, betraying him by the production of a letter to\r\nhimself, in which Drusus proposed that Augustus should be forced to\r\nrestore the public liberty.  In course of time, he shewed the same\r\ndisposition with regard to the rest of his family.  So far was he from\r\nperforming any office of kindness or humanity to his wife, when she was\r\nbanished, and, by her father’s order, confined to one town, that he\r\nforbad her to stir out of the house, or converse with any men.  He even\r\nwronged her of the dowry given her by her father, and of her yearly\r\nallowance, by a quibble of law, because Augustus had made no provision\r\nfor them on her behalf in his will.  Being harassed by his mother, Livia,\r\nwho claimed an equal share in the government with him, he frequently\r\navoided (223) seeing her, and all long and private conferences with her,\r\nlest it should be thought that he was governed by her counsels, which,\r\nnotwithstanding, he sometimes sought, and was in the habit of adopting.\r\nHe was much offended at the senate, when they proposed to add to his\r\nother titles that of the Son of Livia, as well as Augustus.  He,\r\ntherefore, would not suffer her to be called “the Mother of her Country,”\r\n nor to receive any extraordinary public distinction.  Nay, he frequently\r\nadmonished her “not to meddle with weighty affairs, and such as did not\r\nsuit her sex;” especially when he found her present at a fire which broke\r\nout near the Temple of Vesta [351], and encouraging the people and\r\nsoldiers to use their utmost exertions, as she had been used to do in the\r\ntime of her husband.\r\n\r\nLI.  He afterwards proceeded to an open rupture with her, and, as is\r\nsaid, upon this occasion.  She having frequently urged him to place among\r\nthe judges a person who had been made free of the city, he refused her\r\nrequest, unless she would allow it to be inscribed on the roll, “That the\r\nappointment had been extorted from him by his mother.”  Enraged at this,\r\nLivia brought forth from her chapel some letters from Augustus to her,\r\ncomplaining of the sourness and insolence of Tiberius’s temper, and these\r\nshe read.  So much was he offended at these letters having been kept so\r\nlong, and now produced with so much bitterness against him, that some\r\nconsidered this incident as one of the causes of his going into\r\nseclusion, if not the principal reason for his so doing.  In the (224)\r\nwhole years she lived during his retirement, he saw her but once, and\r\nthat for a few hours only.  When she fell sick shortly afterwards, he was\r\nquite unconcerned about visiting her in her illness; and when she died,\r\nafter promising to attend her funeral, he deferred his coming for several\r\ndays, so that the corpse was in a state of decay and putrefaction before\r\nthe interment; and he then forbad divine honours being paid to her,\r\npretending that he acted according to her own directions.  He likewise\r\nannulled her will, and in a short time ruined all her friends and\r\nacquaintance; not even sparing those to whom, on her death-bed, she had\r\nrecommended the care of her funeral, but condemning one of them, a man of\r\nequestrian rank, to the treadmill. [352]\r\n\r\nLII.  He entertained no paternal affection either for his own son Drusus,\r\nor his adopted son Germanicus.  Offended at the vices of the former, who\r\nwas of a loose disposition and led a dissolute life, he was not much\r\naffected at his death; but, almost immediately after the funeral, resumed\r\nhis attention to business, and prevented the courts from being longer\r\nclosed.  The ambassadors from the people of Ilium coming rather late to\r\noffer their condolence, he said to them by way of banter, as if the\r\naffair had already faded from his memory, “And I heartily condole with\r\nyou on the loss of your renowned countryman, Hector.”  He so much\r\naffected to depreciate Germanicus, that he spoke of his achievements as\r\nutterly insignificant, and railed at his most glorious victories as\r\nruinous to the state; complaining of him also to the senate for going to\r\nAlexandria without his knowledge, upon occasion of a great and sudden\r\nfamine at Rome.  It was believed that he took care to have him dispatched\r\nby Cneius Piso, his lieutenant in Syria.  This person was afterwards\r\ntried for the murder, and would, as was supposed, have produced his\r\norders, had they not been contained in a private and confidential\r\ndispatch.  The following words therefore were posted up in many places,\r\nand frequently shouted in the night: “Give us back our Germanicus.”  This\r\nsuspicion was afterwards confirmed by the barbarous treatment of his wife\r\nand children.\r\n\r\n(225) LIII.  His daughter-in-law Agrippina, after the death of her\r\nhusband, complaining upon some occasion with more than ordinary freedom,\r\nhe took her by the hand, and addressed her in a Greek verse to this\r\neffect: “My dear child, do you think yourself injured, because you are\r\nnot empress?”  Nor did he ever vouchsafe to speak to her again.  Upon her\r\nrefusing once at supper to taste some fruit which he presented to her, he\r\ndeclined inviting her to his table, pretending that she in effect charged\r\nhim with a design to poison her; whereas the whole was a contrivance of\r\nhis own.  He was to offer the fruit, and she to be privately cautioned\r\nagainst eating what would infallibly cause her death.  At last, having\r\nher accused of intending to flee for refuge to the statue of Augustus, or\r\nto the army, he banished her to the island of Pandataria [353].  Upon her\r\nreviling him for it, he caused a centurion to beat out one of her eyes;\r\nand when she resolved to starve herself to death, he ordered her mouth to\r\nbe forced open, and meat to be crammed down her throat.  But she\r\npersisting in her resolution, and dying soon afterwards, he persecuted\r\nher memory with the basest aspersions, and persuaded the senate to put\r\nher birth-day amongst the number of unlucky days in the calendar.  He\r\nlikewise took credit for not having caused her to be strangled and her\r\nbody cast upon the Gemonian Steps, and suffered a decree of the senate to\r\npass, thanking him for his clemency, and an offering of gold to be made\r\nto Jupiter Capitolinus on the occasion.\r\n\r\nLIV.  He had by Germanicus three grandsons, Nero, Drusus, and Caius; and\r\nby his son Drusus one, named Tiberius.  Of these, after the loss of his\r\nsons, he commended Nero and Drusus, the two eldest sons of Germanicus, to\r\nthe senate; and at their being solemnly introduced into the forum,\r\ndistributed money among the people.  But when he found that on entering\r\nupon the new year they were included in the public vows for his own\r\nwelfare, he told the senate, “that such honours ought not to be conferred\r\nbut upon those who had been proved, and were of more advanced years.”  By\r\nthus betraying his private feelings towards them, he exposed them to all\r\nsorts of accusations; and after practising many artifices to provoke\r\n(226) them to rail at and abuse him, that he might be furnished with a\r\npretence to destroy them, he charged them with it in a letter to the\r\nsenate; at the same time accusing them, in the bitterest terms, of the\r\nmost scandalous vices.  Upon their being declared enemies by the senate,\r\nhe starved them to death; Nero in the island of Ponza, and Drusus in the\r\nvaults of the Palatium.  It is thought by some, that Nero was driven to a\r\nvoluntary death by the executioner’s shewing him some halters and hooks,\r\nas if he had been sent to him by order of the senate.  Drusus, it is\r\nsaid, was so rabid with hunger, that he attempted to eat the chaff with\r\nwhich his mattress was stuffed.  The relics of both were so scattered,\r\nthat it was with difficulty they were collected.\r\n\r\nLV.  Besides his old friends and intimate acquaintance, he required the\r\nassistance of twenty of the most eminent persons in the city, as\r\ncounsellors in the administration of public affairs.  Out of all this\r\nnumber, scarcely two or three escaped the fury of his savage disposition.\r\nAll the rest he destroyed upon one pretence or another; and among them\r\nAelius Sejanus, whose fall was attended with the ruin of many others.  He\r\nhad advanced this minister to the highest pitch of grandeur, not so much\r\nfrom any real regard for him, as that by his base and sinister\r\ncontrivances he might ruin the children of Germanicus, and thereby secure\r\nthe succession to his own grandson by Drusus.\r\n\r\nLVI.  He treated with no greater leniency the Greeks in his family, even\r\nthose with whom he was most pleased.  Having asked one Zeno, upon his\r\nusing some far-fetched phrases, “What uncouth dialect is that?” he\r\nreplied, “The Doric.”  For this answer he banished him to Cinara [354],\r\nsuspecting that he taunted him with his former residence at Rhodes, where\r\nthe Doric dialect is spoken.  It being his custom to start questions at\r\nsupper, arising out of what he had been reading in the day, and finding\r\nthat Seleucus, the grammarian, used to inquire of his attendants what\r\nauthors he was then studying, and so came prepared for his enquiries--he\r\nfirst turned him out of his family, and then drove him to the extremity\r\nof laying violent hands upon himself.\r\n\r\n(227) LVII.  His cruel and sullen temper appeared when he was still a\r\nboy; which Theodorus of Gadara [355], his master in rhetoric, first\r\ndiscovered, and expressed by a very apposite simile, calling him\r\nsometimes, when he chid him, “Mud mixed with blood.”  But his disposition\r\nshewed itself still more clearly on his attaining the imperial power, and\r\neven in the beginning of his administration, when he was endeavouring to\r\ngain the popular favour, by affecting moderation.  Upon a funeral passing\r\nby, a wag called out to the dead man, “Tell Augustus, that the legacies\r\nhe bequeathed to the people are not yet paid.”  The man being brought\r\nbefore him, he ordered that he should receive what was due to him, and\r\nthen be led to execution, that he might deliver the message to his father\r\nhimself.  Not long afterwards, when one Pompey, a Roman knight, persisted\r\nin his opposition to something he proposed in the senate, he threatened\r\nto put him in prison, and told him, “Of a Pompey I shall make a Pompeian\r\nof you;” by a bitter kind of pun playing upon the man’s name, and the\r\nill-fortune of his party.\r\n\r\nLVIII.  About the same time, when the praetor consulted him, whether it\r\nwas his pleasure that the tribunals should take cognizance of accusations\r\nof treason, he replied, “The laws ought to be put in execution;” and he\r\ndid put them in execution most severely.  Some person had taken off the\r\nhead of Augustus from one of his statues, and replaced it by another\r\n[356].  The matter was brought before the senate, and because the case\r\nwas not clear, the witnesses were put to the torture.  The party accused\r\nbeing found guilty, and condemned, this kind of proceeding was carried so\r\nfar, that it became capital for a man to beat his slave, or change his\r\nclothes, near the statue of Augustus; to carry his head stamped upon the\r\ncoin, or cut in the stone of a ring, into a necessary house, or the\r\nstews; or to reflect upon anything that had been either said or done by\r\nhim.  In fine, a person was condemned to death, for suffering some\r\nhonours to be decreed to him in the colony where he lived, upon the same\r\nday on which they had formerly been decreed to Augustus.\r\n\r\n(228) LIX.  He was besides guilty of many barbarous actions, under the\r\npretence of strictness and reformation of manners, but more to gratify\r\nhis own savage disposition.  Some verses were published, which displayed\r\nthe present calamities of his reign, and anticipated the future. [357]\r\n\r\n    Asper et immitis, breviter vis omnia dicam?\r\n      Dispeream si te mater amare potest.\r\n    Non es eques, quare? non sunt tibi millia centum?\r\n      Omnia si quaeras, et Rhodos exsilium est.\r\n    Aurea mutasti Saturni saecula, Caesar:\r\n      Incolumi nam te, ferrea semper erunt.\r\n    Fastidit vinum, quia jam sit it iste cruorem:\r\n      Tam bibit hunc avide, quam bibit ante merum.\r\n    Adspice felicem sibi, non tibi, Romule, Sullam:\r\n      Et Marium, si vis, adspice, sed reducem.\r\n    Nec non Antoni civilia bella moventis\r\n      Nec semel infectas adspice caeda manus.\r\n    Et dic, Roma perit: regnabit sanguine multo,\r\n      Ad regnum quisquis venit ab exsilio.\r\n\r\n    Obdurate wretch! too fierce, too fell to move\r\n    The least kind yearnings of a mother’s love!\r\n    No knight thou art, as having no estate;\r\n    Long suffered’st thou in Rhodes an exile’s fate,\r\n    No more the happy Golden Age we see;\r\n    The Iron’s come, and sure to last with thee.\r\n    Instead of wine he thirsted for before,\r\n    He wallows now in floods of human gore.\r\n    Reflect, ye Romans, on the dreadful times,\r\n    Made such by Marius, and by Sylla’s crimes.\r\n    Reflect how Antony’s ambitious rage\r\n    Twice scar’d with horror a distracted age,\r\n    And say, Alas!  Rome’s blood in streams will flow,\r\n    When banish’d miscreants rule this world below.\r\n\r\nAt first he would have it understood, that these satirical verses were\r\ndrawn forth by the resentment of those who were impatient under the\r\ndiscipline of reformation, rather than that they spoke their real\r\nsentiments; and he would frequently say, “Let them hate me, so long as\r\nthey do but approve my conduct.” [358]  At length, however, his behaviour\r\nshowed that he was sensible they were too well founded.\r\n\r\n(229) LX.  A few days after his arrival at Capri, a fisherman coming up\r\nto him unexpectedly, when he was desirous of privacy, and presenting him\r\nwith a large mullet, he ordered the man’s face to be scrubbed with the\r\nfish; being terrified at the thought of his having been able to creep\r\nupon him from the back of the island, over such rugged and steep rocks.\r\nThe man, while undergoing the punishment, expressing his joy that he had\r\nnot likewise offered him a large crab which he had also taken, he ordered\r\nhis face to be farther lacerated with its claws.  He put to death one of\r\nthe pretorian guards, for having stolen a peacock out of his orchard.  In\r\none of his journeys, his litter being obstructed by some bushes, he\r\nordered the officer whose duty it was to ride on and examine the road, a\r\ncenturion of the first cohorts, to be laid on his face upon the ground,\r\nand scourged almost to death.\r\n\r\nLXI.  Soon afterwards, he abandoned himself to every species of cruelty,\r\nnever wanting occasions of one kind or another, to serve as a pretext.\r\nHe first fell upon the friends and acquaintance of his mother, then those\r\nof his grandsons, and his daughter-in-law, and lastly those of Sejanus;\r\nafter whose death he became cruel in the extreme.  From this it appeared,\r\nthat he had not been so much instigated by Sejanus, as supplied with\r\noccasions of gratifying his savage temper, when he wanted them.  Though\r\nin a short memoir which he composed of his own life, he had the\r\neffrontery to write, “I have punished Sejanus, because I found him bent\r\nupon the destruction of the children of my son Germanicus,” one of these\r\nhe put to death, when he began to suspect Sejanus; and another, after he\r\nwas taken off.  It would be tedious to relate all the numerous instances\r\nof his cruelty: suffice it to give a few examples, in their different\r\nkinds.  Not a day passed without the punishment of some person or other,\r\nnot excepting holidays, or those appropriated to the worship of the gods.\r\nSome were tried even on New-Year’s-Day.  Of many who were condemned,\r\ntheir wives and children shared the same fate; and for those who were\r\nsentenced to death, the relations were forbid to put on mourning.\r\nConsiderable rewards were voted for the prosecutors, and sometimes for\r\nthe witnesses also.  The information of any person, without exception,\r\nwas taken; and all offences were capital, even speaking (230) a few\r\nwords, though without any ill intention.  A poet was charged with abusing\r\nAgamemnon; and a historian [359], for calling Brutus and Cassius “the\r\nlast of the Romans.”  The two authors were immediately called to account,\r\nand their writings suppressed; though they had been well received some\r\nyears before, and read in the hearing of Augustus.  Some, who were thrown\r\ninto prison, were not only denied the solace of study, but debarred from\r\nall company and conversation.  Many persons, when summoned to trial,\r\nstabbed themselves at home, to avoid the distress and ignominy of a\r\npublic condemnation, which they were certain would ensue.  Others took\r\npoison in the senate house.  The wounds were bound up, and all who had\r\nnot expired, were carried, half-dead, and panting for life, to prison.\r\nThose who were put to death, were thrown down the Gemonian stairs, and\r\nthen dragged into the Tiber.  In one day, twenty were treated in this\r\nmanner; and amongst them women and boys.  Because, according to an\r\nancient custom, it was not lawful to strangle virgins, the young girls\r\nwere first deflowered by the executioner, and afterwards strangled.\r\nThose who were desirous to die, were forced to live.  For he thought\r\ndeath so slight a punishment, that upon hearing that Carnulius, one of\r\nthe accused, who was under prosecution, had killed himself, he exclaimed,\r\n“Carnulius has escaped me.”  In calling over his prisoners, when one of\r\nthem requested the favour of a speedy death, he replied, “You are not yet\r\nrestored to favour.”  A man of consular rank writes in his annals, that\r\nat table, where he himself was present with a large company, he was\r\nsuddenly asked aloud by a dwarf who stood by amongst the buffoons, why\r\nPaconius, who was under a prosecution for treason, lived so long.\r\nTiberius immediately reprimanded him for his pertness; but wrote to the\r\nsenate a few days after, to proceed without delay to the punishment of\r\nPaconius.\r\n\r\nLXII.  Exasperated by information he received respecting the death of his\r\nson Drusus, he carried his cruelty still farther.  He imagined that he\r\nhad died of a disease occasioned (231) by his intemperance; but finding\r\nthat he had been poisoned by the contrivance of his wife Livilla [360]\r\nand Sejanus, he spared no one from torture and death.  He was so entirely\r\noccupied with the examination of this affair, for whole days together,\r\nthat, upon being informed that the person in whose house he had lodged at\r\nRhodes, and whom he had by a friendly letter invited to Rome, was\r\narrived, he ordered him immediately to be put to the torture, as a party\r\nconcerned in the enquiry.  Upon finding his mistake, he commanded him to\r\nbe put to death, that he might not publish the injury done him.  The\r\nplace of execution is still shown at Capri, where he ordered those who\r\nwere condemned to die, after long and exquisite tortures, to be thrown,\r\nbefore his eyes, from a precipice into the sea.  There a party of\r\nsoldiers belonging to the fleet waited for them, and broke their bones\r\nwith poles and oars, lest they should have any life left in them.  Among\r\nvarious kinds of torture invented by him, one was, to induce people to\r\ndrink a large quantity of wine, and then to tie up their members with\r\nharp-strings, thus tormenting them at once by the tightness of the\r\nligature, and the stoppage of their urine.  Had not death prevented him,\r\nand Thrasyllus, designedly, as some say, prevailed with him to defer some\r\nof his cruelties, in hopes of longer life, it is believed that he would\r\nhave destroyed many more: and not have spared even the rest of his\r\ngrandchildren: for he was jealous of Caius, and hated Tiberius as having\r\nbeen conceived in adultery.  This conjecture is indeed highly probable;\r\nfor he used often to say, “Happy Priam, who survived all his children!”\r\n [361]\r\n\r\nLXIII.  Amidst these enormities, in how much fear and apprehension, as\r\nwell as odium and detestation, he lived, is evident from many\r\nindications.  He forbade the soothsayers to be consulted in private, and\r\nwithout some witnesses being present.  He attempted to suppress the\r\noracles in the neighbourhood of the city; but being terrified by the\r\ndivine authority of the (232) Praenestine Lots [362], he abandoned the\r\ndesign.  For though they were sealed up in a box, and carried to home,\r\nyet they were not to be found in it, until it was returned to the temple.\r\nMore than one person of consular rank, appointed governors of provinces,\r\nhe never ventured to dismiss to their respective destinations, but kept\r\nthem until several years after, when he nominated their successors, while\r\nthey still remained present with him.  In the meantime, they bore the\r\ntitle of their office; and he frequently gave them orders, which they\r\ntook care to have executed by their deputies and assistants.\r\n\r\nLXIV.  He never removed his daughter-in-law, or grandsons [363], after\r\ntheir condemnation, to any place, but in fetters and in a covered litter,\r\nwith a guard to hinder all who met them on the road, and travellers, from\r\nstopping to gaze at them.\r\n\r\nLXV.  After Sejanus had plotted against him, though he saw that his\r\nbirth-day was solemnly kept by the public, and divine honours paid to\r\ngolden images of him in every quarter, yet it was with difficulty at\r\nlast, and more by artifice than his imperial power, that he accomplished\r\nhis death.  In the first place, to remove him from about his person,\r\nunder the pretext of doing him honour, he made him his colleague in his\r\nfifth consulship; which, although then absent from the city, he took upon\r\nhim for that purpose, long after his preceding consulship.  Then, having\r\nflattered him with the hope of an alliance by marriage with one of his\r\nown kindred, and the prospect of the tribunitian authority, he suddenly,\r\nwhile Sejanus little expected it, charged him with treason, in an abject\r\nand pitiful address to the senate; in which, among other things, he\r\nbegged them “to send one of the consuls, to conduct himself, a poor\r\nsolitary old man, with a guard of soldiers, into their presence.”  Still\r\ndistrustful, however, and apprehensive of an insurrection, he ordered his\r\ngrandson, Drusus, whom he still kept in confinement at Rome, to be set at\r\nliberty, and if occasion required, to head the troops.  He had likewise\r\nships in readiness to transport him to any of the legions to which he\r\nmight consider it expedient to make his escape.  Meanwhile, he was upon\r\nthe (233) watch, from the summit of a lofty cliff, for the signals which\r\nhe had ordered to be made if any thing occurred, lest the messengers\r\nshould be tardy.  Even when he had quite foiled the conspiracy of\r\nSejanus, he was still haunted as much as ever with fears and\r\napprehensions, insomuch that he never once stirred out of the Villa Jovis\r\nfor nine months after.\r\n\r\nLXVI.  To the extreme anxiety of mind which he now experienced, he had\r\nthe mortification to find superadded the most poignant reproaches from\r\nall quarters.  Those who were condemned to die, heaped upon him the most\r\nopprobrious language in his presence, or by hand-bills scattered in the\r\nsenators’ seats in the theatre.  These produced different effects:\r\nsometimes he wished, out of shame, to have all smothered and concealed;\r\nat other times he would disregard what was said, and publish it himself.\r\nTo this accumulation of scandal and open sarcasm, there is to be\r\nsubjoined a letter from Artabanus, king of the Parthians, in which he\r\nupbraids him with his parricides, murders, cowardice, and lewdness, and\r\nadvises him to satisfy the furious rage of his own people, which he had\r\nso justly excited, by putting an end to his life without delay.\r\n\r\nLXVII.  At last, being quite weary of himself, he acknowledged his\r\nextreme misery, in a letter to the senate, which begun thus: “What to\r\nwrite to you, Conscript Fathers, or how to write, or what not to write at\r\nthis time, may all the gods and goddesses pour upon my head a more\r\nterrible vengeance than that under which I feel myself daily sinking, if\r\nI can tell.”  Some are of opinion that he had a foreknowledge of those\r\nthings, from his skill in the science of divination, and perceived long\r\nbefore what misery and infamy would at last come upon him; and that for\r\nthis reason, at the beginning of his reign, he had absolutely refused the\r\ntitle of the “Father of his Country,” and the proposal of the senate to\r\nswear to his acts; lest he should afterwards, to his greater shame, be\r\nfound unequal to such extraordinary honours.  This, indeed, may be justly\r\ninferred from the speeches which he made upon both those occasions; as\r\nwhen he says, “I shall ever be the same, and shall never change my\r\nconduct, so long as I retain my senses; but to avoid giving a bad\r\nprecedent to posterity, the senate ought to beware of binding themselves\r\nto the acts of (234) any person whatever, who might by some accident or\r\nother be induced to alter them.”  And again: “If ye should at any time\r\nentertain a jealousy of my conduct, and my entire affection for you,\r\nwhich heaven prevent by putting a period to my days, rather than I should\r\nlive to see such an alteration in your opinion of me, the title of Father\r\nwill add no honour to me, but be a reproach to you, for your rashness in\r\nconferring it upon me, or inconstancy in altering your opinion of me.”\r\n\r\nLXVIII.  In person he was large and robust; of a stature somewhat above\r\nthe common size; broad in the shoulders and chest, and proportionable in\r\nthe rest of his frame.  He used his left hand more readily and with more\r\nforce than his right; and his joints were so strong, that he could bore a\r\nfresh, sound apple through with his finger, and wound the head of a boy,\r\nor even a young man, with a fillip.  He was of a fair complexion, and\r\nwore his hair so long behind, that it covered his neck, which was\r\nobserved to be a mark of distinction affected by the family.  He had a\r\nhandsome face, but it was often full of pimples.  His eyes, which were\r\nlarge, had a wonderful faculty of seeing in the night-time, and in the\r\ndark, for a short time only, and immediately after awaking from sleep;\r\nbut they soon grew dim again.  He walked with his neck stiff and upright:\r\ngenerally with a frowning countenance, being for the most part silent:\r\nwhen he spoke to those about him, it was very slowly, and usually\r\naccompanied with a slight gesticulation of his fingers.  All which, being\r\nrepulsive habits and signs of arrogance, were remarked by Augustus, who\r\noften endeavoured to excuse them to the senate and people, declaring that\r\n“they were natural defects, which proceeded from no viciousness of mind.”\r\n He enjoyed a good state of health, without interruption, almost during\r\nthe whole period of his rule; though, from the thirtieth year of his age,\r\nhe treated it himself according to his own discretion, without any\r\nmedical assistance.\r\n\r\nLXIX.  In regard to the gods, and matters of religion, he discovered much\r\nindifference; being greatly addicted to astrology, and fully persuaded\r\nthat all things were governed by fate.  Yet he was extremely afraid of\r\nlightning, and when the sky was in a disturbed state, always wore a\r\nlaurel crown on his head; because it is supposed that the leaf of that\r\ntree is never touched by the lightning.\r\n\r\n(235) LXX.  He applied himself with great diligence to the liberal arts,\r\nboth Greek and Latin.  In his Latin style, he affected to imitate Messala\r\nCorvinus [364], a venerable man, to whom he had paid much respect in his\r\nown early years.  But he rendered his style obscure by excessive\r\naffectation and abstruseness, so that he was thought to speak better\r\nextempore, than in a premeditated discourse.  He composed likewise a\r\nlyric ode, under the title of “A Lamentation upon the death of Lucius\r\nCaesar;” and also some Greek poems, in imitation of Euphorion, Rhianus,\r\nand Parthenius [365].  These poets he greatly admired, and placed their\r\nworks and statues in the public libraries, amongst the eminent authors of\r\nantiquity.  On this account, most of the learned men of the time vied\r\nwith each other in publishing observations upon them, which they\r\naddressed to him.  His principal study, however, was the history of the\r\nfabulous ages, inquiring even into its trifling details in a ridiculous\r\nmanner; for he used to try the grammarians, a class of men which, as I\r\nhave already observed, he much affected, with such questions as these:\r\n“Who was Hecuba’s mother?  What name did Achilles assume among the\r\nvirgins?  What was it that the Sirens used to sing?”  And the first day\r\nthat he entered the senate-house, after the death of Augustus, as if he\r\nintended to pay respect at once to his father’s memory and to the gods,\r\nhe made an offering of frankincense and wine, but without any music, in\r\nimitation of Minos, upon the death of his son.\r\n\r\nLXXI.  Though he was ready and conversant with the Greek tongue, yet he\r\ndid not use it everywhere; but chiefly he avoided it in the senate-house,\r\ninsomuch that having occasion to employ the word monopolium (monopoly),\r\nhe first begged pardon for being obliged to adopt a foreign word.  And\r\nwhen, in a decree of the senate, the word emblaema (emblem) was read, he\r\nproposed to have it changed, and that a Latin word should be substituted\r\nin its room; or, if no proper one could be found, to express the thing by\r\ncircumlocution.  A soldier (236) who was examined as a witness upon a\r\ntrial, in Greek [366], he would not allow to reply, except in Latin.\r\n\r\nLXXII.  During the whole time of his seclusion at Capri, twice only he\r\nmade an effort to visit Rome.  Once he came in a galley as far as the\r\ngardens near the Naumachia, but placed guards along the banks of the\r\nTiber, to keep off all who should offer to come to meet him.  The second\r\ntime he travelled on the Appian Way [367], as far as the seventh\r\nmile-stone from the city, but he immediately returned, without entering it,\r\nhaving only taken a view of the walls at a distance.  For what reason he\r\ndid not disembark in his first excursion, is uncertain; but in the last,\r\nhe was deterred from entering the city by a prodigy.  He was in the habit\r\nof diverting himself with a snake, and upon going to feed it with his own\r\nhand, according to custom, he found it devoured by ants: from which he\r\nwas advised to beware of the fury of the mob.  On this account, returning\r\nin all haste to Campania, he fell ill at Astura [368]; but recovering a\r\nlittle, went on to Circeii [369].  And to obviate any suspicion of his\r\nbeing in a bad state of health, he was not only present at the sports in\r\nthe camp, but encountered, with javelins, a wild boar, which was let\r\nloose in the arena.  Being immediately seized with a pain in the side,\r\nand catching cold upon his over-heating himself in the exercise, he\r\nrelapsed into a worse condition than he was before.  He held out,\r\nhowever, for some time; and sailing as far as Misenum [370], omitted\r\nnothing (237) in his usual mode of life, not even in his entertainments,\r\nand other gratifications, partly from an ungovernable appetite, and\r\npartly to conceal his condition.  For Charicles, a physician, having\r\nobtained leave of absence, on his rising from table, took his hand to\r\nkiss it; upon which Tiberius, supposing he did it to feel his pulse,\r\ndesired him to stay and resume his place, and continued the entertainment\r\nlonger than usual.  Nor did he omit his usual custom of taking his\r\nstation in the centre of the apartment, a lictor standing by him, while\r\nhe took leave of each of the party by name.\r\n\r\nLXXIII.  Meanwhile, finding, upon looking over the acts of the senate,\r\n“that some person under prosecution had been discharged, without being\r\nbrought to a hearing,” for he had only written cursorily that they had\r\nbeen denounced by an informer; he complained in a great rage that he was\r\ntreated with contempt, and resolved at all hazards to return to Capri;\r\nnot daring to attempt any thing until he found himself in a place of\r\nsecurity.  But being detained by storms, and the increasing violence of\r\nhis disorder, he died shortly afterwards, at a villa formerly belonging\r\nto Lucullus, in the seventy-eighth year of his age [371], and the\r\ntwenty-third of his reign, upon the seventeenth of the calends of April\r\n(16th March), in the consulship of Cneius Acerronius Proculus and Caius\r\nPontius Niger.  Some think that a slow-consuming poison was given him by\r\nCaius [372].  Others say that during the interval of the intermittent\r\nfever with which he happened to be seized, upon asking for food, it was\r\ndenied him.  Others report, that he was stifled by a pillow thrown upon\r\nhim [373], when, on his recovering from a swoon, he called for his ring,\r\nwhich had been taken from him in the fit.  Seneca writes, “That finding\r\nhimself dying, he took his signet ring off his finger, and held it a\r\nwhile, as if he would deliver it to somebody; but put it again upon his\r\nfinger, and lay for some time, with his left hand clenched, and without\r\nstirring; when suddenly summoning his attendants, (238) and no one\r\nanswering the call, he rose; but his strength failing him, he fell down\r\nat a short distance from his bed.”\r\n\r\nLXXIV.  Upon his last birth-day, he had brought a full-sized statue of\r\nthe Timenian Apollo from Syracuse, a work of exquisite art, intending to\r\nplace it in the library of the new temple [374]; but he dreamt that the\r\ngod appeared to him in the night, and assured him “that his statue could\r\nnot be erected by him.”  A few days before he died, the Pharos at Capri\r\nwas thrown down by an earthquake.  And at Misenum, some embers and live\r\ncoals, which were brought in to warm his apartment, went out, and after\r\nbeing quite cold, burst out into a flame again towards evening, and\r\ncontinued burning very brightly for several hours.\r\n\r\nLXXV.  The people were so much elated at his death, that when they first\r\nheard the news, they ran up and down the city, some crying out, “Away\r\nwith Tiberius to the Tiber;” others exclaiming, “May the earth, the\r\ncommon mother of mankind, and the infernal gods, allow him no abode in\r\ndeath, but amongst the wicked.”  Others threatened his body with the hook\r\nand the Gemonian stairs, their indignation at his former cruelty being\r\nincreased by a recent atrocity.  It had been provided by an act of the\r\nsenate, that the execution of condemned criminals should always be\r\ndeferred until the tenth day after the sentence.  Now this fell on the\r\nvery day when the news of Tiberius’s death arrived, and in consequence of\r\nwhich the unhappy men implored a reprieve, for mercy’s sake; but, as\r\nCaius had not yet arrived, and there was no one else to whom application\r\ncould be made on their behalf, their guards, apprehensive of violating\r\nthe law, strangled them, and threw them down the Gemonian stairs.  This\r\nroused the people to a still greater abhorrence of the tyrant’s memory,\r\nsince his cruelty continued in use even after he was dead.  As soon as\r\nhis corpse was begun to be moved from Misenum, many cried out for its\r\nbeing carried to Atella [375], and being half burnt there (239) in the\r\namphitheatre.  It was, however, brought to Rome, and burnt with the usual\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nLXXVI.  He had made about two years before, duplicates of his will, one\r\nwritten by his own hand, and the other by that of one of his freedmen;\r\nand both were witnessed by some persons of very mean rank.  He appointed\r\nhis two grandsons, Caius by Germanicus, and Tiberius by Drusus, joint\r\nheirs to his estate; and upon the death of one of them, the other was to\r\ninherit the whole.  He gave likewise many legacies; amongst which were\r\nbequests to the Vestal Virgins, to all the soldiers, and each one of the\r\npeople of Rome, and to the magistrates of the several quarters of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAt the death of Augustus, there had elapsed so long a period from the\r\noverthrow of the republic by Julius Caesar, that few were now living who\r\nhad been born under the ancient constitution of the Romans; and the mild\r\nand prosperous administration of Augustus, during forty-four years, had\r\nby this time reconciled the minds of the people to a despotic government.\r\nTiberius, the adopted son of the former sovereign, was of mature age; and\r\nthough he had hitherto lived, for the most part, abstracted from any\r\nconcern with public affairs, yet, having been brought up in the family of\r\nAugustus, he was acquainted with his method of government, which, there\r\nwas reason to expect, he would render the model of his own.  Livia, too,\r\nhis mother, and the relict of the late emperor, was still living, a woman\r\nvenerable by years, who had long been familiar with the councils of\r\nAugustus, and from her high rank, as well as uncommon affability,\r\npossessed an extensive influence amongst all classes of the people.\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances in favour of Tiberius’s succession at the\r\ndemise of Augustus; but there were others of a tendency disadvantageous\r\nto his views.  His temper was haughty and reserved: Augustus had often\r\napologised for the ungraciousness of his manners.  He was disobedient to\r\nhis mother; and though he had not openly discovered any propensity to\r\nvice, he enjoyed none of those qualities which usually conciliate\r\npopularity.  To these considerations it is to be added, that Postumus\r\nAgrippa, the grandson of Augustus by Julia, was living; and if\r\nconsanguinity was to be the rule of succession, his right was\r\nindisputably preferable to that of an adopted son.  Augustus had sent\r\nthis youth into exile a few years before; but, towards the close (240) of\r\nhis life, had expressed a design of recalling him, with the view, as was\r\nsupposed, of appointing him his successor.  The father of young Agrippa\r\nhad been greatly beloved by the Romans; and the fate of his mother,\r\nJulia, though she was notorious for her profligacy, had ever been\r\nregarded by them with peculiar sympathy and tenderness.  Many, therefore,\r\nattached to the son the partiality entertained for his parents; which was\r\nincreased not only by a strong suspicion, but a general surmise, that his\r\nelder brothers, Caius and Lucius, had been violently taken off, to make\r\nway for the succession of Tiberius.  That an obstruction was apprehended\r\nto Tiberius’s succession from this quarter, is put beyond all doubt, when\r\nwe find that the death of Augustus was industriously kept secret, until\r\nyoung Agrippa should be removed; who, it is generally agreed, was\r\ndispatched by an order from Livia and Tiberius conjointly, or at least\r\nfrom the former.  Though, by this act, there remained no rival to\r\nTiberius, yet the consciousness of his own want of pretensions to the\r\nRoman throne, seems to have still rendered him distrustful of the\r\nsuccession; and that he should have quietly obtained it, without the\r\nvoice of the people, the real inclination of the senate, or the support\r\nof the army, can be imputed only to the influence of his mother, and his\r\nown dissimulation.  Ardently solicitous to attain the object, yet\r\naffecting a total indifference; artfully prompting the senate to give him\r\nthe charge of the government, at the time that he intimated an invincible\r\nreluctance to accept it; his absolutely declining it in perpetuity, but\r\nfixing no time for an abdication; his deceitful insinuation of bodily\r\ninfirmities, with hints likewise of approaching old age, that he might\r\nallay in the senate all apprehensions of any great duration of his power,\r\nand repress in his adopted son, Germanicus, the emotions of ambition to\r\ndisplace him; form altogether a scene of the most insidious policy,\r\ninconsistency, and dissimulation.\r\n\r\nIn this period died, in the eighty-sixth year of her age, Livia Drusilla,\r\nmother of the emperor, and the relict of Augustus, whom she survived\r\nfifteen years.  She was the daughter of L. Drusus Calidianus and married\r\nTiberius Claudius Nero, by whom she had two sons, Tiberius and Drusus.\r\nThe conduct of this lady seems to justify the remark of Caligula, that\r\n“she was an Ulysses in a woman’s dress.”  Octavius first saw her as she\r\nfled from the danger which threatened her husband, who had espoused the\r\ncause of Antony; and though she was then pregnant, he resolved to marry\r\nher; whether with her own inclination or not, is left by Tacitus\r\nundetermined.  To pave the way for this union, he divorced his wife\r\nScribonia, and with the approbation of the Augurs, which he could have no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining, celebrated (241) his nuptials with Livia.  There\r\nensued from this marriage no issue, though much desired by both parties;\r\nbut Livia retained, without interruption, an unbounded ascendancy over\r\nthe emperor, whose confidence she abused, while the uxorious husband\r\nlittle suspected that he was cherishing in his bosom a viper who was to\r\nprove the destruction of his house.  She appears to have entertained a\r\npredominant ambition of giving an heir to the Roman empire; and since it\r\ncould not be done by any fruit of her marriage with Augustus, she\r\nresolved on accomplishing that end in the person of Tiberius, the eldest\r\nson by her former husband.  The plan which she devised for this purpose,\r\nwas to exterminate all the male offspring of Augustus by his daughter\r\nJulia, who was married to Agrippa; a stratagem which, when executed,\r\nwould procure for Tiberius, through the means of adoption, the eventual\r\nsuccession to the empire.  The cool yet sanguinary policy, and the\r\npatient perseverance of resolution, with which she prosecuted her design,\r\nhave seldom been equalled.  While the sons of Julia were yet young, and\r\nwhile there was still a possibility that she herself might have issue by\r\nAugustus, she suspended her project, in the hope, perhaps, that accident\r\nor disease might operate in its favour; but when the natural term of her\r\nconstitution had put a period to her hopes of progeny, and when the\r\ngrandsons of the emperor were risen to the years of manhood, and had been\r\nadopted by him, she began to carry into execution what she long had\r\nmeditated.  The first object devoted to destruction was C. Caesar\r\nAgrippa, the eldest of Augustus’s grandsons.  This promising youth was\r\nsent to Armenia, upon an expedition against the Persians; and Lollius,\r\nwho had been his governor, either accompanied him thither from Rome, or\r\nmet him in the East, where he had obtained some appointment.  From the\r\nhand of this traitor, perhaps under the pretext of exercising the\r\nauthority of a preceptor, but in reality instigated by Livia, the young\r\nprince received a fatal blow, of which he died some time after.\r\n\r\nThe manner of Caius’s death seems to have been carefully kept from the\r\nknowledge of Augustus, who promoted Lollius to the consulship, and made\r\nhim governor of a province; but, by his rapacity in this station, he\r\nafterwards incurred the emperor’s displeasure.  The true character of\r\nthis person had escaped the keen discernment of Horace, as well as the\r\nsagacity of the emperor; for in two epistles addressed to Lollius, he\r\nmentions him as great and accomplished in the superlative degree; maxime\r\nLolli, liberrime Lolli; so imposing had been the manners and address of\r\nthis deceitful courtier.\r\n\r\nLucius, the second son of Julia, was banished into Campania, (242) for\r\nusing, as it is said, so litious language against his grandfather.  In\r\nthe seventh year of his exile Augustus proposed to recall him; but Livia\r\nand Tiberius, dreading the consequences of his being restored to the\r\nemperor’s favour, put in practice the expedient of having him immediately\r\nassassinated.  Postumus Agrippa, the third son, incurred the displeasure\r\nof his grandfather in the same way as Lucius, and was confined at\r\nSurrentum, where he remained a prisoner until he was put to death by the\r\norder either of Livia alone, or in conjunction with Tiberius, as was\r\nbefore observed.\r\n\r\nSuch was the catastrophe, through the means of Livia, of all the\r\ngrandsons of Augustus; and reason justifies the inference, that she who\r\nscruple not to lay violent hands upon those young men, had formerly\r\npractised every artifice that could operate towards rendering them\r\nobnoxious to the emperor.  We may even ascribe to her dark intrigues the\r\ndissolute conduct of Julia for the woman who could secretly act as\r\nprocuress to her own husband, would feel little restraint upon her mind\r\nagainst corrupting his daughter, when such an effect might contribute to\r\nanswer the purpose which she had in view.  But in the ingratitude of\r\nTiberius, however undutiful and reprehensible in a son towards a parent,\r\nshe at last experienced a just retribution for the crimes in which she\r\nhad trained him to procure the succession to the empire.  To the disgrace\r\nof her sex, she introduced amongst the Romans the horrible practice of\r\ndomestic murder, little known before the times when the thirst or\r\nintoxication of unlimited power had vitiated the social affections; and\r\nshe transmitted to succeeding ages a pernicious example, by which\r\nimmoderate ambition might be gratified, at the expense of every moral\r\nobligation, as well as of humanity.\r\n\r\nOne of the first victims in the sanguinary reign of the present emperor,\r\nwas Germanicus, the son of Drusus, Tiberius’s own brother, and who had\r\nbeen adopted by his uncle himself.  Under any sovereign, of a temper\r\ndifferent from that of Tiberius, this amiable and meritorious prince\r\nwould have been held in the highest esteem.  At the death of his\r\ngrandfather Augustus, he was employed in a war in Germany, where he\r\ngreatly distinguished himself by his military achievements; and as soon\r\nas intelligence of that event arrived, the soldiers, by whom he was\r\nextremely beloved, unanimously saluted him emperor.  Refusing, however,\r\nto accept this mark of their partiality, he persevered in allegiance to\r\nthe government of his uncle, and prosecuted the war with success.  Upon\r\nthe conclusion of this expedition, he was sent, with the title of emperor\r\nin the East, to repress the seditions of the Armenians, in which he was\r\nequally successful.  But the (243) fame which he acquired, served only to\r\nrender him an object of jealousy to Tiberius, by whose order he was\r\nsecretly poisoned at Daphne, near Antioch, in the thirty-fourth year of\r\nhis age.  The news of Germanicus’s death was received at Rome with\r\nuniversal lamentation; and all ranks of the people entertained an\r\nopinion, that, had he survived Tiberius, he would have restored the\r\nfreedom of the republic.  The love and gratitude of the Romans decreed\r\nmany honours to his memory.  It was ordered, that his name should be sung\r\nin a solemn procession of the Salii; that crowns of oak, in allusion to\r\nhis victories, should be placed upon curule chairs in the hall pertaining\r\nto the priests of Augustus; and that an effigy of him in ivory should be\r\ndrawn upon a chariot, preceding the ceremonies of the Circensian games.\r\nTriumphal arches were erected, one at Rome, another on the banks of the\r\nRhine, and a third upon Mount Amanus in Syria, with inscriptions of his\r\nachievements, and that he died for his services to the republic. [376]\r\n\r\nHis obsequies were celebrated, not with the display of images and funeral\r\npomp, but with the recital of his praises and the virtues which rendered\r\nhim illustrious.  From a resemblance in his personal accomplishments, his\r\nage, the manner of his death, and the vicinity of Daphne to Babylon, many\r\ncompared his fate to that of Alexander the Great.  He was celebrated for\r\nhumanity and benevolence, as well as military talents, and amidst the\r\ntoils of war, found leisure to cultivate the arts of literary genius.  He\r\ncomposed two comedies in Greek, some epigrams, and a translation of\r\nAratus into Latin verse.  He married Agrippina, the daughter of M.\r\nAgrippa, by whom he had nine children.  This lady, who had accompanied\r\nher husband into the east, carried his ashes to Italy, and accused his\r\nmurderer, Piso; who, unable to bear up against the public odium incurred\r\nby that transaction, laid violent hands upon himself.  Agrippina was now\r\nnearly in the same predicament with regard to Tiberius, that Ovid had\r\nformerly been in respect of Augustus.  He was sensible, that when she\r\naccused Piso, she was not ignorant of the person by whom the perpetrator\r\nof the murder had been instigated; and her presence, therefore, seeming\r\ncontinually to reproach him with his guilt, he resolved to rid himself of\r\na person become so obnoxious to his sight, and banished her to the island\r\nof Pandataria, where she died some time afterwards of famine.\r\n\r\nBut it was not sufficient to gratify this sanguinary tyrant, that he had,\r\nwithout any cause, cut off both Germanicus and his wife Agrippina: the\r\ndistinguished merits and popularity of that prince were yet to be\r\nrevenged upon his children; and accordingly he (244) set himself to\r\ninvent a pretext for their destruction.  After endeavouring in vain, by\r\nvarious artifices, to provoke the resentment of Nero and Drusus against\r\nhim, he had recourse to false accusation, and not only charged them with\r\nseditious designs, to which their tender years were ill adapted, but with\r\nvices of a nature the most scandalous.  By a sentence of the senate,\r\nwhich manifested the extreme servility of that assembly, he procured them\r\nboth to be declared open enemies to their country.  Nero he banished to\r\nthe island of Pontia, where, like his unfortunate mother, he miserably\r\nperished by famine; and Drusus was doomed to the same fate, in the lower\r\npart of the Palatium, after suffering for nine days the violence of\r\nhunger, and having, as is related, devoured part of his bed.  The\r\nremaining son, Caius, on account of his vicious disposition, he resolved\r\nto appoint his successor on the throne, that, after his own death, a\r\ncomparison might be made in favour of his memory, when the Romans should\r\nbe governed by a sovereign yet more vicious and more tyrannical, if\r\npossible, than himself.\r\n\r\nSejanus, the minister in the present reign, imitated with success, for\r\nsome time, the hypocrisy of his master; and, had his ambitious temper,\r\nimpatient of attaining its object, allowed him to wear the mask for a\r\nlonger period, he might have gained the imperial diadem; in the pursuit\r\nof which he was overtaken by that fate which he merited still more by his\r\ncruelties than his perfidy to Tiberius.  This man was a native of\r\nVolsinium in Tuscany, and the son of a Roman knight.  He had first\r\ninsinuated himself into the favour of Caius Caesar, the grandson of\r\nAugustus, after whose death he courted the friendship of Tiberius, and\r\nobtained in a short time his entire confidence, which he improved to the\r\nbest advantage.  The object which he next pursued, was to gain the\r\nattachment of the senate, and the officers of the army; besides whom,\r\nwith a new kind of policy, he endeavoured to secure in his interest every\r\nlady of distinguished connections, by giving secretly to each of them a\r\npromise of marriage, as soon as he should arrive at the sovereignty.  The\r\nchief obstacles in his way were the sons and grandsons of Tiberius; and\r\nthese he soon sacrificed to his ambition, under various pretences.\r\nDrusus, the eldest of this progeny, having in a fit of passion struck the\r\nfavourite, was destined by him to destruction.  For this purpose, he had\r\nthe presumption to seduce Livia, the wife of Drusus, to whom she had\r\nborne several children; and she consented to marry her adulterer upon the\r\ndeath of her husband, who was soon after poisoned, through the means of\r\nan eunuch named Lygdus, by order of her and Sejanus.\r\n\r\nDrusus was the son of Tiberius by Vipsania, one of Agrippa’s (245)\r\ndaughters.  He displayed great intrepidity during the war in the\r\nprovinces of Illyricum and Pannonia, but appears to have been dissolute\r\nin his morals.  Horace is said to have written the Ode in praise of\r\nDrusus at the desire of Augustus; and while the poet celebrates the\r\nmilitary courage of the prince, he insinuates indirectly a salutary\r\nadmonition to the cultivation of the civil virtues:\r\n\r\n        Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam,\r\n        Rectique cultus pectora roborant:\r\n          Utcunque defecere mores,\r\n            Dedecorant bene nata culpae.--Ode iv. 4.\r\n\r\n    Yet sage instructions to refine the soul\r\n      And raise the genius, wondrous aid impart,\r\n    Conveying inward, as they purely roll,\r\n      Strength to the mind and vigour to the heart:\r\n    When morals fail, the stains of vice disgrace\r\n    The fairest honours of the noblest race.--Francis.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Drusus, Sejanus openly avowed a desire of marrying the\r\nwidowed princess; but Tiberius opposing this measure, and at the same\r\ntime recommending Germanicus to the senate as his successor in the\r\nempire, the mind of Sejanus was more than ever inflamed by the united,\r\nand now furious, passions of love and ambition.  He therefore urged his\r\ndemand with increased importunity; but the emperor still refusing his\r\nconsent, and things being not yet ripe for an immediate revolt, Sejanus\r\nthought nothing so favourable for the prosecution of his designs as the\r\nabsence of Tiberius from the capital.  With this view, under the pretence\r\nof relieving his master from the cares of government, he persuaded him to\r\nretire to a distance from Rome.  The emperor, indolent and luxurious,\r\napproved of the proposal, and retired into Campania, leaving to his\r\nambitious minister the whole direction of the empire.  Had Sejanus now\r\nbeen governed by common prudence and moderation, he might have attained\r\nto the accomplishment of all his wishes; but a natural impetuosity of\r\ntemper, and the intoxication of power, precipitated him into measures\r\nwhich soon effected his destruction.  As if entirely emancipated from the\r\ncontrol of a master, he publicly declared himself sovereign of the Roman\r\nempire, and that Tiberius, who had by this time retired to Capri, was\r\nonly the dependent prince of that tributary island.  He even went so far\r\nin degrading the emperor, as to have him introduced in a ridiculous light\r\nupon the stage.  Advice of Sejanus’s proceedings was soon carried to the\r\nemperor at Capri; his indignation was immediately excited; and with a\r\nconfidence founded upon an authority exercised for several years, he sent\r\norders for accusing Sejanus (246) before the senate.  This mandate no\r\nsooner arrived, than the audacious minister was deserted by his\r\nadherents; he was in a short time after seized without resistance, and\r\nstrangled in prison the same day.\r\n\r\nHuman nature recoils with horror at the cruelties of this execrable\r\ntyrant, who, having first imbrued his hands in the blood of his own\r\nrelations, proceeded to exercise them upon the public with indiscriminate\r\nfury.  Neither age nor sex afforded any exemption from his insatiable\r\nthirst for blood.  Innocent children were condemned to death, and\r\nbutchered in the presence of their parents; virgins, without any imputed\r\nguilt, were sacrificed to a similar destiny; but there being an ancient\r\ncustom of not strangling females in that situation, they were first\r\ndeflowered by the executioner, and afterwards strangled, as if an\r\natrocious addition to cruelty could sanction the exercise of it.  Fathers\r\nwere constrained by violence to witness the death of their own children;\r\nand even the tears of a mother, at the execution of her child, were\r\npunished as a capital offence.  Some extraordinary calamities, occasioned\r\nby accident, added to the horrors of the reign.  A great number of houses\r\non Mount Caelius were destroyed by fire; and by the fall of a temporary\r\nbuilding at Fidenae, erected for the purpose of exhibiting public shows,\r\nabout twenty thousand persons were either greatly hurt, or crushed to\r\ndeath in the rains.\r\n\r\nBy another fire which afterwards broke out, a part of the Circus was\r\ndestroyed, with the numerous buildings on Mount Aventine.  The only act\r\nof munificence displayed by Tiberius during his reign, was upon the\r\noccasion of those fires, when, to qualify the severity of his government,\r\nhe indemnified the most considerable sufferers for the loss they had\r\nsustained.\r\n\r\nThrough the whole of his life, Tiberius seems to have conducted himself\r\nwith a uniform repugnance to nature.  Affable on a few occasions, but in\r\ngeneral averse to society, he indulged, from his earliest years, a\r\nmoroseness of disposition, which counterfeited the appearance of austere\r\nvirtue; and in the decline of life, when it is common to reform from\r\njuvenile indiscretions, he launched forth into excesses, of a kind the\r\nmost unnatural and most detestable.  Considering the vicious passions\r\nwhich had ever brooded in his heart, it may seem surprising that he\r\nrestrained himself within the bounds of decency during so many years\r\nafter his accession; but though utterly destitute of reverence or\r\naffection for his mother, he still felt, during her life, a filial awe\r\nupon his mind: and after her death, he was actuated by a slavish fear of\r\nSejanus, until at last political necessity absolved him likewise from\r\nthis restraint.  These checks being both removed, (247) he rioted without\r\nany control, either from sentiment or authority.\r\n\r\nPliny relates, that the art of making glass malleable was actually\r\ndiscovered under the reign of Tiberius, and that the shop and tools of\r\nthe artist were destroyed, lest, by the establishment of this invention,\r\ngold and silver should lose their value.  Dion adds, that the author of\r\nthe discovery was put to death.\r\n\r\nThe gloom which darkened the Roman capital during this melancholy period,\r\nshed a baleful influence on the progress of science throughout the\r\nempire, and literature languished during the present reign, in the same\r\nproportion as it had flourished in the preceding.  It is doubtful whether\r\nsuch a change might not have happened in some degree, even had the\r\ngovernment of Tiberius been equally mild with that of his predecessor.\r\nThe prodigious fame of the writers of the Augustan age, by repressing\r\nemulation, tended to a general diminution of the efforts of genius for\r\nsome time; while the banishment of Ovid, it is probable, and the capital\r\npunishment of a subsequent poet, for censuring the character of\r\nAgamemnon, operated towards the farther discouragement of poetical\r\nexertions.  There now existed no circumstance to counterbalance these\r\ndisadvantages.  Genius no longer found a patron either in the emperor or\r\nhis minister; and the gates of the palace were shut against all who\r\ncultivated the elegant pursuits of the Muses.  Panders, catamites,\r\nassassins, wretches stained with every crime, were the constant\r\nattendants, as the only fit companions, of the tyrant who now occupied\r\nthe throne.  We are informed, however, that even this emperor had a taste\r\nfor the liberal arts, and that he composed a lyric poem upon the death of\r\nLucius Caesar, with some Greek poems in imitation of Euphorion, Rhianus,\r\nand Parthenius.  But none of these has been transmitted to posterity: and\r\nif we should form an opinion of them upon the principle of Catullus, that\r\nto be a good poet one ought to be a good man, there is little reason to\r\nregret that they have perished.\r\n\r\nWe meet with no poetical production in this reign; and of prose writers\r\nthe number is inconsiderable, as will appear from the following account\r\nof them.----\r\n\r\nVELLEIUS PATERCULUS was born of an equestrian family in Campania, and\r\nserved as a military tribune under Tiberius, in his expeditions in Gaul\r\nand Germany.  He composed an Epitome of the History of Greece and Rome,\r\nwith that of other nations of remote antiquity: but of this work there\r\nonly remain fragments of the history of Greece and Rome, from the\r\nconquest of Perseus to the seventeenth year of the reign of Tiberius.  It\r\nis written in two books, addressed to Marcus Vinicius, who had (248) the\r\noffice of consul.  Rapid in the narrative, and concise as well as elegant\r\nin style, this production exhibits a pleasing epitome of ancient\r\ntransactions, enlivened occasionally with anecdotes, and an expressive\r\ndescription of characters.  In treating of the family of Augustus,\r\nPaterculus is justly liable to the imputation of partiality, which he\r\nincurs still more in the latter period of his history, by the praise\r\nwhich is lavished on Tiberius and his minister Sejanus.  He intimates a\r\ndesign of giving a more full account of the civil war which followed the\r\ndeath of Julius Caesar; but this, if he ever accomplished it, has not\r\nbeen transmitted to posterity.  Candid, but decided in his judgment of\r\nmotives and actions, if we except his invectives against Pompey, he shows\r\nlittle propensity to censure; but in awarding praise, he is not equally\r\nparsimonious, and, on some occasions, risks the imputation of hyperbole.\r\nThe grace, however, and the apparent sincerity with which it is bestowed,\r\nreconcile us to the compliment.  This author concludes his history with a\r\nprayer for the prosperity of the Roman empire.----\r\n\r\nVALERIUS MAXIMUS was descended of a Patrician family; but we learn\r\nnothing more concerning him, than that for some time he followed a\r\nmilitary life under Sextus Pompey.  He afterwards betook himself to\r\nwriting, and has left an account, in nine books, of the memorable\r\napophthegms and actions of eminent persons; first of the Romans, and\r\nafterwards of foreign nations.  The subjects are of various kinds,\r\npolitical, moral, and natural, ranged into distinct classes.  His\r\ntransitions from one subject to another are often performed with\r\ngracefulness; and where he offers any remarks, they generally show the\r\nauthor to be a man of judgment and observation.  Valerius Maximus is\r\nchargeable with no affectation of style, but is sometimes deficient in\r\nthat purity of language which might be expected in the age of Tiberius,\r\nto whom the work is addressed.  What inducement the author had to this\r\ndedication, we know not; but as it is evident from a passage in the ninth\r\nbook, that the compliment was paid after the death of Sejanus, and\r\nconsequently in the most shameful period of Tiberius’s reign, we cannot\r\nentertain any high opinion of the independent spirit of Valerius Maximus,\r\nwho could submit to flatter a tyrant, in the zenith of infamy and\r\ndetestation.  But we cannot ascribe the cause to any delicate artifice,\r\nof conveying to Tiberius, indirectly, an admonition to reform his\r\nconduct.  Such an expedient would have only provoked the severest\r\nresentment from his jealousy.----\r\n\r\nPHAEDRUS was a native of Thrace, and was brought to Rome as a slave.  He\r\nhad the good fortune to come into the service of Augustus, where,\r\nimproving his talents by reading, he obtained (249) the favour of the\r\nemperor, and was made one of his freedmen.  In the reign of Tiberius, he\r\ntranslated into Iambic verse the Fables of Aesop.  They are divided into\r\nfive books, and are not less conspicuous for precision and simplicity of\r\nthought, than for purity and elegance of style; conveying moral\r\nsentiments with unaffected ease and impressive energy.  Phaedrus\r\nunderwent, for some time, a persecution from Sejanus, who, conscious of\r\nhis own delinquency, suspected that he was obliquely satirised in the\r\ncommendations bestowed on virtue by the poet.  The work of Phaedrus is\r\none of the latest which have been brought to light since the revival of\r\nlearning.  It remained in obscurity until two hundred years ago, when it\r\nwas discovered in a library at Rheims.----\r\n\r\nHYGINUS is said to have been a native of Alexandria, or, according to\r\nothers, a Spaniard.  He was, like Phaedrus, a freedman of Augustus; but,\r\nthough industrious, he seems not to have improved himself so much as his\r\ncompanion, in the art of composition.  He wrote, however, a mythological\r\nhistory, under the title of Fables, a work called Poeticon Astronomicon,\r\nwith a treatise on agriculture, commentaries on Virgil, the lives of\r\neminent men, and some other productions now lost.  His remaining works\r\nare much mutilated, and, if genuine, afford an unfavourable specimen of\r\nhis elegance and correctness as a writer.\r\n\r\nCELSUS was a physician in the time of Tiberius, and has written eight\r\nbooks, De Medicina, in which he has collected and digested into order all\r\nthat is valuable on the subject, in the Greek and Roman authors.  The\r\nprofessors of Medicine were at that time divided into three sects, viz.,\r\nthe Dogmatists, Empirics, and Methodists; the first of whom deviated less\r\nthan the others from the plan of Hippocrates; but they were in general\r\nirreconcilable to each other, in respect both of their opinions and\r\npractice.  Celsus, with great judgment, has occasionally adopted\r\nparticular doctrines from each of them; and whatever he admits into his\r\nsystem, he not only establishes by the most rational observations, but\r\nconfirms by its practical utility.  In justness of remark, in force of\r\nargument, in precision and perspicuity, as well as in elegance of\r\nexpression, he deservedly occupies the most distinguished rank amongst\r\nthe medical writers of antiquity.  It appears that Celsus likewise wrote\r\non agriculture, rhetoric, and military affairs; but of those several\r\ntreatises no fragments now remain.\r\n\r\nTo the writers of this reign we must add APICIUS COELIUS, who has left a\r\nbook De Re Coquinaria [of Cookery].  There were three Romans of the name\r\nof Apicius, all remarkable for their (250) gluttony.  The first lived in\r\nthe time of the Republic, the last in that of Trajan, and the\r\nintermediate Apicius under the emperors Augustus and Tiberius.  This man,\r\nas Seneca informs us, wasted on luxurious living, sexcenties sestertium,\r\na sum equal to 484,375 pounds sterling.  Upon examining the state of his\r\naffairs, he found that there remained no more of his estate than centies\r\nsestertium, 80,729l. 3s. 4d., which seeming to him too small to live\r\nupon, he ended his days by poison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAIUS CAESAR CALIGULA.\r\n\r\n(251)\r\n\r\nI.  Germanicus, the father of Caius Caesar, and son of Drusus and the\r\nyounger Antonia, was, after his adoption by Tiberius, his uncle,\r\npreferred to the quaestorship [377] five years before he had attained the\r\nlegal age, and immediately upon the expiration of that office, to the\r\nconsulship [378].  Having been sent to the army in Germany, he restored\r\norder among the legions, who, upon the news of Augustus’s death,\r\nobstinately refused to acknowledge Tiberius as emperor [379], and offered\r\nto place him at the head of the state.  In which affair it is difficult\r\nto say, whether his regard to filial duty, or the firmness of his\r\nresolution, was most conspicuous.  Soon afterwards he defeated the enemy,\r\nand obtained the honours of a triumph.  Being then made consul for the\r\nsecond time [380], before he could enter upon his office he was obliged\r\nto set out suddenly for the east, where, after he had conquered the king\r\nof Armenia, and reduced Cappadocia into the form of a province, he died\r\nat Antioch, of a lingering distemper, in the thirty-fourth year of his\r\nage [381], not without the suspicion of being poisoned.  For besides the\r\nlivid spots which appeared all over his body, and a foaming at the mouth;\r\nwhen his corpse was burnt, the heart was found entire among the bones;\r\nits nature being such, as it is supposed, that when tainted by poison, it\r\nis indestructible by fire. [382]\r\n\r\nII.  It was a prevailing opinion, that he was taken off by the\r\ncontrivance of Tiberius, and through the means of Cneius Piso.  This\r\nperson, who was about the same time prefect of Syria, and made no secret\r\nof his position being such, that (252) he must either offend the father\r\nor the son, loaded Germanicus, even during his sickness, with the most\r\nunbounded and scurrilous abuse, both by word and deed; for which, upon\r\nhis return to Rome, he narrowly escaped being torn to pieces by the\r\npeople, and was condemned to death by the senate.\r\n\r\nIII.  It is generally agreed, that Germanicus possessed all the noblest\r\nendowments of body and mind in a higher degree than had ever before\r\nfallen to the lot of any man; a handsome person, extraordinary courage,\r\ngreat proficiency in eloquence and other branches of learning, both Greek\r\nand Roman; besides a singular humanity, and a behaviour so engaging, as\r\nto captivate the affections of all about him.  The slenderness of his\r\nlegs did not correspond with the symmetry and beauty of his person in\r\nother respects; but this defect was at length corrected by his habit of\r\nriding after meals.  In battle, he often engaged and slew an enemy in\r\nsingle combat.  He pleaded causes, even after he had the honour of a\r\ntriumph.  Among other fruits of his studies, he left behind him some\r\nGreek comedies.  Both at home and abroad he always conducted himself in a\r\nmanner the most unassuming.  On entering any free and confederate town,\r\nhe never would be attended by his lictors.  Whenever he heard, in his\r\ntravels, of the tombs of illustrious men, he made offerings over them to\r\nthe infernal deities.  He gave a common grave, under a mound of earth, to\r\nthe scattered relics of the legionaries slain under Varus, and was the\r\nfirst to put his hand to the work of collecting and bringing them to the\r\nplace of burial.  He was so extremely mild and gentle to his enemies,\r\nwhoever they were, or on what account soever they bore him enmity, that,\r\nalthough Piso rescinded his decrees, and for a long time severely\r\nharassed his dependents, he never showed the smallest resentment, until\r\nhe found himself attacked by magical charms and imprecations; and even\r\nthen the only steps he took was to renounce all friendship with him,\r\naccording to ancient custom, and to exhort his servants to avenge his\r\ndeath, if any thing untoward should befall him.\r\n\r\nIV.  He reaped the fruit of his noble qualities in abundance, being so\r\nmuch esteemed and beloved by his friends, that Augustus (to say nothing\r\nof his other relations) being a long time in doubt, whether he should not\r\nappoint him his successor, at last ordered Tiberius to adopt him.  He was\r\nso extremely popular, that many authors tell us, the crowds of those who\r\nwent to meet him upon his coming to any place, or to attend him at his\r\ndeparture, were so prodigious, that he was sometimes in danger of his\r\nlife; and that upon his return from Germany, after he had quelled the\r\nmutiny in the army there, all the cohorts of the pretorian guards marched\r\nout to meet him, notwithstanding the order that only two should go; and\r\nthat all the people of Rome, both men and women, of every age, sex, and\r\nrank, flocked as far as the twentieth milestone to attend his entrance.\r\n\r\nV.  At the time of his death, however, and afterwards, they displayed\r\nstill greater and stronger proofs of their extraordinary attachment to\r\nhim.  The day on which he died, stones were thrown at the temples, the\r\naltars of the gods demolished, the household gods, in some cases, thrown\r\ninto the streets, and new-born infants exposed.  It is even said that\r\nbarbarous nations, both those engaged in intestine wars, and those in\r\nhostilities against us, all agreed to a cessation of arms, as if they had\r\nbeen mourning for some very near and common friend; that some petty kings\r\nshaved their beards and their wives’ heads, in token of their extreme\r\nsorrow; and that the king of kings [383] forbore his exercise of hunting\r\nand feasting with his nobles, which, amongst the Parthians, is equivalent\r\nto a cessation of all business in a time of public mourning with us.\r\n\r\nVI.  At Rome, upon the first news of his sickness, the city was thrown\r\ninto great consternation and grief, waiting impatiently for farther\r\nintelligence; when suddenly, in the evening, a report, without any\r\ncertain author, was spread, that he was recovered; upon which the people\r\nflocked with torches (254) and victims to the Capitol, and were in such\r\nhaste to pay the vows they had made for his recovery, that they almost\r\nbroke open the doors.  Tiberius was roused from out of his sleep with the\r\nnoise of the people congratulating one another, and singing about the\r\nstreets,\r\n\r\n    Salva Roma, salva patria, salvus est Germanicus.\r\n    Rome is safe, our country safe, for our Germanicus is safe.\r\n\r\nBut when certain intelligence of his death arrived, the mourning of the\r\npeople could neither be assuaged by consolation, nor restrained by\r\nedicts, and it continued during the holidays in the month of December.\r\nThe atrocities of the subsequent times contributed much to the glory of\r\nGermanicus, and the endearment of his memory; all people supposing, and\r\nwith reason, that the fear and awe of him had laid a restraint upon the\r\ncruelty of Tiberius, which broke out soon afterwards.\r\n\r\nVII.  Germanicus married Agrippina, the daughter of Marcus Agrippa and\r\nJulia, by whom he had nine children, two of whom died in their infancy,\r\nand another a few years after; a sprightly boy, whose effigy, in the\r\ncharacter of a Cupid, Livia set up in the temple of Venus in the Capitol.\r\nAugustus also placed another statue of him in his bed-chamber, and used\r\nto kiss it as often as he entered the apartment.  The rest survived their\r\nfather; three daughters, Agrippina, Drusilla, and Livilla, who were born\r\nin three successive years; and as many sons, Nero, Drusus, and Caius\r\nCaesar.  Nero and Drusus, at the accusation of Tiberius, were declared\r\npublic enemies.\r\n\r\nVIII.  Caius Caesar was born on the day before the calends [31st August]\r\nof September, at the time his father and Caius Fonteius Capito were\r\nconsuls [384].  But where he was born, is rendered uncertain from the\r\nnumber of places which are said to have given him birth.  Cneius Lentulus\r\nGaetulicus [385] says that he was born at Tibur; Pliny the younger, in\r\nthe country of the Treviri, at a village called Ambiatinus, above\r\nConfluentes [386]; and he alleges, as a proof of it, that altars are\r\nthere shown with this inscription: “For Agrippina’s child-birth.”  Some\r\nverses which were published in his reign, intimate that he was born in\r\nthe winter quarters of the legions,\r\n\r\n    In castris natus, patriis nutritius in armis,\r\n      Jam designati principis omen erat.\r\n\r\n    Born in the camp, and train’d in every toil\r\n    Which taught his sire the haughtiest foes to foil;\r\n    Destin’d he seem’d by fate to raise his name,\r\n    And rule the empire with Augustan fame.\r\n\r\nI find in the public registers that he was born at Antium.  Pliny charges\r\nGaetulicus as guilty of an arrant forgery, merely to soothe the vanity of\r\na conceited young prince, by giving him the lustre of being born in a\r\ncity sacred to Hercules; and says that he advanced this false assertion\r\nwith the more assurance, because, the year before the birth of Caius,\r\nGermanicus had a son of the same name born at Tibur; concerning whose\r\namiable childhood and premature death I have already spoken [387].  Dates\r\nclearly prove that Pliny is mistaken; for the writers of Augustus’s\r\nhistory all agree, that Germanicus, at the expiration of his consulship,\r\nwas sent into Gaul, after the birth of Caius.  Nor will the inscription\r\nupon the altar serve to establish Pliny’s opinion; because Agrippina was\r\ndelivered of two daughters in that country, and any child-birth, without\r\nregard to sex, is called puerperium, as the ancients were used to call\r\ngirls puerae, and boys puelli.  There is also extant a letter written by\r\nAugustus, a few months before his death, to his granddaughter Agrippina,\r\nabout the same Caius (for there was then no other child of hers living\r\nunder that name).  He writes as follows: “I gave orders yesterday for\r\nTalarius and Asellius to set out on their journey towards you, if the\r\ngods permit, with your child Caius, upon the fifteenth of the calends of\r\nJune [18th May].  I also send with him a physician of mine, and I wrote\r\nto Germanicus that he may retain him if he pleases.  Farewell, my dear\r\nAgrippina, and take what care you can to (256) come safe and well to your\r\nGermanicus.”  I imagine it is sufficiently evident that Caius could not\r\nbe born at a place to which he was carried from The City when almost two\r\nyears old.  The same considerations must likewise invalidate the evidence\r\nof the verses, and the rather, because the author is unknown.  The only\r\nauthority, therefore, upon which we can depend in this matter, is that of\r\nthe acts, and the public register; especially as he always preferred\r\nAntium to every other place of retirement, and entertained for it all\r\nthat fondness which is commonly attached to one’s native soil.  It is\r\nsaid, too, that, upon his growing weary of the city, he designed to have\r\ntransferred thither the seat of empire.\r\n\r\nIX.  It was to the jokes of the soldiers in the camp that he owed the\r\nname of Caligula [388], he having been brought up among them in the dress\r\nof a common soldier.  How much his education amongst them recommended him\r\nto their favour and affection, was sufficiently apparent in the mutiny\r\nupon the death of Augustus, when the mere sight of him appeased their\r\nfury, though it had risen to a great height.  For they persisted in it,\r\nuntil they observed that he was sent away to a neighbouring city [389],\r\nto secure him against all danger.  Then, at last, they began to relent,\r\nand, stopping the chariot in which he was conveyed, earnestly deprecated\r\nthe odium to which such a proceeding would expose them.\r\n\r\nX.  He likewise attended his father in his expedition to Syria.  After\r\nhis return, he lived first with his mother, and, when she was banished,\r\nwith his great-grandmother, Livia Augusta, in praise of whom, after her\r\ndecease, though then only a boy, he pronounced a funeral oration in the\r\nRostra.  He was then transferred to the family of his grandmother,\r\nAntonia, and afterwards, in the twentieth year of his age, being called\r\nby Tiberius to Capri, he in one and the same day assumed the manly habit,\r\nand shaved his beard, but without receiving any of the honours which had\r\nbeen paid to his brothers on a similar (257) occasion.  While he remained\r\nin that island, many insidious artifices were practised, to extort from\r\nhim complaints against Tiberius, but by his circumspection he avoided\r\nfalling into the snare [390].  He affected to take no more notice of the\r\nill-treatment of his relations, than if nothing had befallen them.  With\r\nregard to his own sufferings, he seemed utterly insensible of them, and\r\nbehaved with such obsequiousness to his grandfather [391] and all about\r\nhim, that it was justly said of him, “There never was a better servant,\r\nnor a worse master.”\r\n\r\nXI.  But he could not even then conceal his natural disposition to\r\ncruelty and lewdness.  He delighted in witnessing the infliction of\r\npunishments, and frequented taverns and bawdy-houses in the night-time,\r\ndisguised in a periwig and a long coat; and was passionately addicted to\r\nthe theatrical arts of singing and dancing.  All these levities Tiberius\r\nreadily connived at, in hopes that they might perhaps correct the\r\nroughness of his temper, which the sagacious old man so well understood,\r\nthat he often said, “That Caius was destined to be the ruin of himself\r\nand all mankind; and that he was rearing a hydra [392] for the people of\r\nRome, and a Phaeton for all the world.” [393]\r\n\r\nXII.  Not long afterwards, he married Junia Claudilla, the daughter of\r\nMarcus Silanus, a man of the highest rank.  Being then chosen augur in\r\nthe room of his brother Drusus, before he could be inaugurated he was\r\nadvanced to the pontificate, with no small commendation of his dutiful\r\nbehaviour, and great capacity.  The situation of the court likewise was\r\nat this time favourable to his fortunes, as it was now left destitute of\r\nsupport, Sejanus being suspected, and soon afterwards taken off; and he\r\nwas by degrees flattered with the hope of succeeding Tiberius in the\r\nempire.  In order more effectually to secure this object, upon Junia’s\r\ndying in child-bed, he engaged in a criminal commerce with Ennia Naevia,\r\nthe wife (258) of Macro, at that time prefect of the pretorian cohorts;\r\npromising to marry her if he became emperor, to which he bound himself,\r\nnot only by an oath, but by a written obligation under his hand.  Having\r\nby her means insinuated himself into Macro’s favour, some are of opinion\r\nthat he attempted to poison Tiberius, and ordered his ring to be taken\r\nfrom him, before the breath was out of his body; and that, because he\r\nseemed to hold it fast, he caused a pillow to be thrown upon him [394],\r\nsqueezing him by the throat, at the same time, with his own hand.  One of\r\nhis freedmen crying out at this horrid barbarity, he was immediately\r\ncrucified.  These circumstances are far from being improbable, as some\r\nauthors relate that, afterwards, though he did not acknowledge his having\r\na hand in the death of Tiberius, yet he frankly declared that he had\r\nformerly entertained such a design; and as a proof of his affection for\r\nhis relations, he would frequently boast, “That, to revenge the death of\r\nhis mother and brothers, he had entered the chamber of Tiberius, when he\r\nwas asleep, with a poniard, but being seized with a fit of compassion,\r\nthrew it away, and retired; and that Tiberius, though aware of his\r\nintention, durst not make any inquiries, or attempt revenge.”\r\n\r\nXIII.  Having thus secured the imperial power, he fulfilled by his\r\nelevation the wish of the Roman people, I may venture to say, of all\r\nmankind; for he had long been the object of expectation and desire to the\r\ngreater part of the provincials and soldiers, who had known him when a\r\nchild; and to the whole people of Rome, from their affection for the\r\nmemory of Germanicus, his father, and compassion for the family almost\r\nentirely destroyed.  Upon his moving from Misenum, therefore, although he\r\nwas in mourning, and following the corpse of Tiberius, he had to walk\r\namidst altars, victims, and lighted torches, with prodigious crowds of\r\npeople everywhere attending him, in transports of joy, and calling him,\r\nbesides other auspicious names, by those of “their star,” “their chick,”\r\n “their pretty puppet,” and “bantling.”\r\n\r\nXIV.  Immediately on his entering the city, by the joint acclamations of\r\nthe senate, and people, who broke into the senate-house, Tiberius’s will\r\nwas set aside, it having left his (259) other grandson [395], then a\r\nminor, coheir with him, the whole government and administration of\r\naffairs was placed in his hands; so much to the joy and satisfaction of\r\nthe public, that, in less than three months after, above a hundred and\r\nsixty thousand victims are said to have been offered in sacrifice.  Upon\r\nhis going, a few days afterwards, to the nearest islands on the coast of\r\nCampania [396], vows were made for his safe return; every person\r\nemulously testifying their care and concern for his safety.  And when he\r\nfell ill, the people hung about the Palatium all night long; some vowed,\r\nin public handbills, to risk their lives in the combats of the\r\namphitheatre, and others to lay them down, for his recovery.  To this\r\nextraordinary love entertained for him by his countrymen, was added an\r\nuncommon regard by foreign nations.  Even Artabanus, king of the\r\nParthians, who had always manifested hatred and contempt for Tiberius,\r\nsolicited his friendship; came to hold a conference with his consular\r\nlieutenant, and passing the Euphrates, paid the highest honours to the\r\neagles, the Roman standards, and the images of the Caesars. [397]\r\n\r\nXV.  Caligula himself inflamed this devotion, by practising all the arts\r\nof popularity.  After he had delivered, with floods of tears, a speech in\r\npraise of Tiberius, and buried him with the utmost pomp, he immediately\r\nhastened over to Pandataria and the Pontian islands [398], to bring\r\nthence the ashes of his mother and brother; and, to testify the great\r\nregard he had for their memory, he performed the voyage in a very\r\ntempestuous season.  He approached their remains with profound\r\nveneration, and deposited them in the urns with his own hands.  Having\r\nbrought them in grand solemnity to Ostia [399], with an ensign flying in\r\nthe stern of the galley, and thence up the Tiber to Rome, they were borne\r\nby persons of the first distinction in the equestrian order, on two\r\nbiers, into the mausoleum [400], (260) at noon-day.  He appointed yearly\r\nofferings to be solemnly and publicly celebrated to their memory, besides\r\nCircensian games to that of his mother, and a chariot with her image to\r\nbe included in the procession [401].  The month of September he called\r\nGermanicus, in honour of his father.  By a single decree of the senate,\r\nhe heaped upon his grandmother, Antonia, all the honours which had been\r\never conferred on the empress Livia.  His uncle, Claudius, who till then\r\ncontinued in the equestrian order, he took for his colleague in the\r\nconsulship.  He adopted his brother, Tiberius [402], on the day he took\r\nupon him the manly habit, and conferred upon him the title of “Prince of\r\nthe Youths.”  As for his sisters, he ordered these words to be added to\r\nthe oaths of allegiance to himself: “Nor will I hold myself or my own\r\nchildren more dear than I do Caius and his sisters:” [403] and commanded\r\nall resolutions proposed by the consuls in the senate to be prefaced\r\nthus: “May what we are going to do, prove fortunate and happy to Caius\r\nCaesar and his sisters.”  With the like popularity he restored all those\r\nwho had been condemned and banished, and granted an act of indemnity\r\nagainst all impeachments and past offences.  To relieve the informers and\r\nwitnesses against his mother and brothers from all apprehension, he\r\nbrought the records of their trials into the forum, and there burnt them,\r\ncalling loudly on the gods to witness that he had not read or handled\r\nthem.  A memorial which was offered him relative to his own security, he\r\nwould not receive, declaring, “that he had done nothing to make any one\r\nhis enemy:” and said, at the same time, “he had no ears for informers.”\r\n\r\nXVI.  The Spintriae, those panderers to unnatural lusts [404], he\r\nbanished from the city, being prevailed upon not to throw them (261) into\r\nthe sea, as he had intended.  The writings of Titus Labienus, Cordus\r\nCremutius, and Cassius Severus, which had been suppressed by an act of\r\nthe senate, he permitted to be drawn from obscurity, and universally\r\nread; observing, “that it would be for his own advantage to have the\r\ntransactions of former times delivered to posterity.”  He published\r\naccounts of the proceedings of the government--a practice which had been\r\nintroduced by Augustus, but discontinued by Tiberius [405].  He granted\r\nthe magistrates a full and free jurisdiction, without any appeal to\r\nhimself.  He made a very strict and exact review of the Roman knights,\r\nbut conducted it with moderation; publicly depriving of his horse every\r\nknight who lay under the stigma of any thing base and dishonourable; but\r\npassing over the names of those knights who were only guilty of venial\r\nfaults, in calling over the list of the order.  To lighten the labours of\r\nthe judges, he added a fifth class to the former four.  He attempted\r\nlikewise to restore to the people their ancient right of voting in the\r\nchoice of magistrates [406].  He paid very honourably, and without any\r\ndispute, the legacies left by Tiberius in his will, though it had been\r\nset aside; as likewise those left by the will of Livia Augusta, which\r\nTiberius had annulled.  He remitted the hundredth penny, due to the\r\ngovernment in all auctions throughout Italy.  He made up to many their\r\nlosses sustained by fire; and when he restored their kingdoms to any\r\nprinces, he likewise allowed them all the arrears of the taxes and\r\nrevenues which had accrued in the interval; as in the case of Antiochus\r\nof Comagene, where the confiscation would have amounted to a hundred\r\nmillions of sesterces.  To prove to the world that he was ready to\r\nencourage good examples of every kind, he gave to a freed-woman eighty\r\nthousand sesterces, for not discovering a crime committed by her patron,\r\nthough she had been put to exquisite torture for that purpose.  For all\r\nthese acts of beneficence, amongst other honours, a golden shield was\r\ndecreed to him, which the colleges of priests were to carry annually,\r\nupon a fixed day, into the Capitol, with the senate attending, and the\r\nyouth of the nobility, of both sexes, celebrating the praise of his\r\nvirtues in (262) songs.  It was likewise ordained, that the day on which\r\nhe succeeded to the empire should be called Palilia, in token of the\r\ncity’s being at that time, as it were, new founded. [407]\r\n\r\nXVII.  He held the consulship four times; the first [408], from the\r\ncalends [the first] of July for two months: the second [409], from the\r\ncalends of January for thirty days; the third [410], until the ides [the\r\n13th] of January; and the fourth [411], until the seventh of the same\r\nides [7th January].  Of these, the two last he held successively.  The\r\nthird he assumed by his sole authority at Lyons; not, as some are of\r\nopinion, from arrogance or neglect of rules; but because, at that\r\ndistance, it was impossible for him to know that his colleague had died a\r\nlittle before the beginning of the new year.  He twice distributed to the\r\npeople a bounty of three hundred sesterces a man, and as often gave a\r\nsplendid feast to the senate and the equestrian order, with their wives\r\nand children.  In the latter, he presented to the men forensic garments,\r\nand to the women and children purple scarfs.  To make a perpetual\r\naddition to the public joy for ever, he added to the Saturnalia [412] one\r\nday, which he called Juvenalis [the juvenile feast].\r\n\r\nXVIII.  He exhibited some combats of gladiators, either in the\r\namphitheatre of Taurus [413], or in the Septa, with which he intermingled\r\ntroops of the best pugilists from Campania and Africa.  He did not always\r\npreside in person upon those occasions, but sometimes gave a commission\r\nto magistrates or friends to supply his place.  He frequently entertained\r\nthe people with stage-plays (263) of various kinds, and in several parts\r\nof the city, and sometimes by night, when he caused the whole city to be\r\nlighted.  He likewise gave various things to be scrambled for among the\r\npeople, and distributed to every man a basket of bread with other\r\nvictuals.  Upon this occasion, he sent his own share to a Roman knight,\r\nwho was seated opposite to him, and was enjoying himself by eating\r\nheartily.  To a senator, who was doing the same, he sent an appointment\r\nof praetor-extraordinary.  He likewise exhibited a great number of\r\nCircensian games from morning until night; intermixed with the hunting of\r\nwild beasts from Africa, or the Trojan exhibition.  Some of these games\r\nwere celebrated with peculiar circumstances; the Circus being overspread\r\nwith vermilion and chrysolite; and none drove in the chariot races who\r\nwere not of the senatorian order.  For some of these he suddenly gave the\r\nsignal, when, upon his viewing from the Gelotiana [414] the preparations\r\nin the Circus, he was asked to do so by a few persons in the neighbouring\r\ngalleries.\r\n\r\nXIX.  He invented besides a new kind of spectacle, such as had never been\r\nheard of before.  For he made a bridge, of about three miles and a half\r\nin length, from Baiae to the mole of Puteoli [415], collecting trading\r\nvessels from all quarters, mooring them in two rows by their anchors, and\r\nspreading earth upon them to form a viaduct, after the fashion of the\r\nAppian Way [416].  This bridge he crossed and recrossed for two days\r\ntogether; the first day mounted on a horse richly caparisoned, wearing on\r\nhis head a crown of oak leaves, armed with a battle-axe, a Spanish\r\nbuckler and a sword, and in a cloak made of cloth of gold; the day\r\nfollowing, in the habit of a charioteer, standing in a chariot, drawn by\r\ntwo high-bred horses, having with him a young boy, Darius by name, one of\r\nthe Parthian hostages, with a cohort of the pretorian guards attending\r\nhim, and a (264) party of his friends in cars of Gaulish make [417].\r\nMost people, I know, are of opinion, that this bridge was designed by\r\nCaius, in imitation of Xerxes, who, to the astonishment of the world,\r\nlaid a bridge over the Hellespont, which is somewhat narrower than the\r\ndistance betwixt Baiae and Puteoli.  Others, however, thought that he did\r\nit to strike terror in Germany and Britain, which he was upon the point\r\nof invading, by the fame of some prodigious work.  But for myself, when I\r\nwas a boy, I heard my grandfather say [418], that the reason assigned by\r\nsome courtiers who were in habits of the greatest intimacy with him, was\r\nthis; when Tiberius was in some anxiety about the nomination of a\r\nsuccessor, and rather inclined to pitch upon his grandson, Thrasyllus the\r\nastrologer had assured him, “That Caius would no more be emperor, than he\r\nwould ride on horseback across the gulf of Baiae.”\r\n\r\nXX.  He likewise exhibited public diversions in Sicily, Grecian games at\r\nSyracuse, and Attic plays at Lyons in Gaul besides a contest for\r\npre-eminence in the Grecian and Roman eloquence; in which we are told that\r\nsuch as were baffled bestowed rewards upon the best performers, and were\r\nobliged to compose speeches in their praise: but that those who performed\r\nthe worst, were forced to blot out what they had written with a sponge or\r\ntheir tongue, unless they preferred to be beaten with a rod, or plunged\r\nover head and ears into the nearest river.\r\n\r\nXXI.  He completed the works which were left unfinished by Tiberius,\r\nnamely, the temple of Augustus, and the theatre (265) of Pompey [419].\r\nHe began, likewise, the aqueduct from the neighbourhood of Tibur [420],\r\nand an amphitheatre near the Septa [421]; of which works, one was\r\ncompleted by his successor Claudius, and the other remained as he left\r\nit.  The walls of Syracuse, which had fallen to decay by length of time,\r\nhe repaired, as he likewise did the temples of the gods.  He formed plans\r\nfor rebuilding the palace of Polycrates at Samos, finishing the temple of\r\nthe Didymaean Apollo at Miletus, and building a town on a ridge of the\r\nAlps; but, above all, for cutting through the isthmus in Achaia [422];\r\nand even sent a centurion of the first rank to measure out the work.\r\n\r\nXXII.  Thus far we have spoken of him as a prince.  What remains to be\r\nsaid of him, bespeaks him rather a monster than a man.  He assumed a\r\nvariety of titles, such as “Dutiful,” “The (266) Pious,” “The Child of\r\nthe Camp, the Father of the Armies,” and “The Greatest and Best Caesar.”\r\n Upon hearing some kings, who came to the city to pay him court,\r\nconversing together at supper, about their illustrious descent, he\r\nexclaimed,\r\n\r\n    Eis koiranos eto, eis basileus.\r\n    Let there be but one prince, one king.\r\n\r\nHe was strongly inclined to assume the diadem, and change the form of\r\ngovernment, from imperial to regal; but being told that he far exceeded\r\nthe grandeur of kings and princes, he began to arrogate to himself a\r\ndivine majesty.  He ordered all the images of the gods, which were famous\r\neither for their beauty, or the veneration paid them, among which was\r\nthat of Jupiter Olympius, to be brought from Greece, that he might take\r\nthe heads off, and put on his own.  Having continued part of the Palatium\r\nas far as the Forum, and the temple of Castor and Pollux being converted\r\ninto a kind of vestibule to his house, he often stationed himself between\r\nthe twin brothers, and so presented himself to be worshipped by all\r\nvotaries; some of whom saluted him by the name of Jupiter Latialis.  He\r\nalso instituted a temple and priests, with choicest victims, in honour of\r\nhis own divinity.  In his temple stood a statue of gold, the exact image\r\nof himself, which was daily dressed in garments corresponding with those\r\nhe wore himself.  The most opulent persons in the city offered themselves\r\nas candidates for the honour of being his priests, and purchased it\r\nsuccessively at an immense price.  The victims were flamingos, peacocks,\r\nbustards, guinea-fowls, turkey and pheasant hens, each sacrificed on\r\ntheir respective days.  On nights when the moon was full, he was in the\r\nconstant habit of inviting her to his embraces and his bed.  In the\r\nday-time he talked in private to Jupiter Capitolinus; one while whispering\r\nto him, and another turning his ear to him: sometimes he spoke aloud, and\r\nin railing language.  For he was overheard to threaten the god thus:\r\n\r\n    Hae em’ anaeir’, hae ego se; [423]\r\n    Raise thou me up, or I’ll--\r\n\r\n(267) until being at last prevailed upon by the entreaties of the god, as\r\nhe said, to take up his abode with him, he built a bridge over the temple\r\nof the Deified Augustus, by which he joined the Palatium to the Capitol.\r\nAfterwards, that he might be still nearer, he laid the foundations of a\r\nnew palace in the very court of the Capitol.\r\n\r\nXXIII.  He was unwilling to be thought or called the grandson of Agrippa,\r\nbecause of the obscurity of his birth; and he was offended if any one,\r\neither in prose or verse, ranked him amongst the Caesars.  He said that\r\nhis mother was the fruit of an incestuous commerce, maintained by\r\nAugustus with his daughter Julia.  And not content with this vile\r\nreflection upon the memory of Augustus, he forbad his victories at\r\nActium, and on the coast of Sicily, to be celebrated, as usual; affirming\r\nthat they had been most pernicious and fatal to the Roman people.  He\r\ncalled his grandmother Livia Augusta “Ulysses in a woman’s dress,” and\r\nhad the indecency to reflect upon her in a letter to the senate, as of\r\nmean birth, and descended, by the mother’s side, from a grandfather who\r\nwas only one of the municipal magistrates of Fondi; whereas it is\r\ncertain, from the public records, that Aufidius Lurco held high offices\r\nat Rome.  His grandmother Antonia desiring a private conference with him,\r\nhe refused to grant it, unless Macro, the prefect of the pretorian\r\nguards, were present.  Indignities of this kind, and ill usage, were the\r\ncause of her death; but some think he also gave her poison.  Nor did he\r\npay the smallest respect to her memory after her death, but witnessed the\r\nburning from his private apartment.  His brother Tiberius, who had no\r\nexpectation of any violence, was suddenly dispatched by a military\r\ntribune sent by his order for that purpose.  He forced Silanus, his\r\nfather-in-law, to kill himself, by cutting his throat with a razor.  The\r\npretext he alleged for these murders was, that the latter had not\r\nfollowed him upon his putting to sea in stormy weather, but stayed behind\r\nwith the view of seizing the city, if he should perish.  The other, he\r\nsaid, smelt of an antidote, which he had taken to prevent his being\r\npoisoned by him; whereas Silanus was only afraid of being sea-sick, and\r\nthe disagreeableness of a voyage; and Tiberius had merely taken a\r\nmedicine for an habitual cough, (268) which was continually growing\r\nworse.  As for his successor Claudius, he only saved him for a\r\nlaughing-stock.\r\n\r\nXXIV.  He lived in the habit of incest with all his sisters; and at\r\ntable, when much company was present, he placed each of them in turns\r\nbelow him, whilst his wife reclined above him.  It is believed, that he\r\ndeflowered one of them, Drusilla, before he had assumed the robe of\r\nmanhood; and was even caught in her embraces by his grandmother Antonia,\r\nwith whom they were educated together.  When she was afterwards married\r\nto Cassius Longinus, a man of consular rank, he took her from him, and\r\nkept her constantly as if she were his lawful wife.  In a fit of\r\nsickness, he by his will appointed her heiress both of his estate and the\r\nempire.  After her death, he ordered a public mourning for her; during\r\nwhich it was capital for any person to laugh, use the bath, or sup with\r\nhis parents, wife, or children.  Being inconsolable under his affliction,\r\nhe went hastily, and in the night-time, from the City; going through\r\nCampania to Syracuse, and then suddenly returned without shaving his\r\nbeard, or trimming his hair.  Nor did he ever afterwards, in matters of\r\nthe greatest importance, not even in the assemblies of the people or\r\nbefore the soldiers, swear any otherwise, than “By the divinity of\r\nDrusilla.”  The rest of his sisters he did not treat with so much\r\nfondness or regard; but frequently prostituted them to his catamites.  He\r\ntherefore the more readily condemned them in the case of Aemilius\r\nLepidus, as guilty of adultery, and privy to that conspiracy against him.\r\nNor did he only divulge their own hand-writing relative to the affair,\r\nwhich he procured by base and lewd means, but likewise consecrated to\r\nMars the Avenger three swords which had been prepared to stab him, with\r\nan inscription, setting forth the occasion of their consecration.\r\n\r\nXXV.  Whether in the marriage of his wives, in repudiating them, or\r\nretaining them, he acted with greater infamy, it is difficult to say.\r\nBeing at the wedding of Caius Piso with Livia Orestilla, he ordered the\r\nbride to be carried to his own house, but within a few days divorced her,\r\nand two years after banished her; because it was thought, that upon her\r\ndivorce she returned to the embraces of her former husband.  (269) Some\r\nsay, that being invited to the wedding-supper, he sent a messenger to\r\nPiso, who sat opposite to him, in these words: “Do not be too fond with\r\nmy wife,” and that he immediately carried her off.  Next day he published\r\na proclamation, importing, “That he had got a wife as Romulus and\r\nAugustus had done.” [424]  Lollia Paulina, who was married to a man of\r\nconsular rank in command of an army, he suddenly called from the province\r\nwhere she was with her husband, upon mention being made that her\r\ngrandmother was formerly very beautiful, and married her; but he soon\r\nafterwards parted with her, interdicting her from having ever afterwards\r\nany commerce with man.  He loved with a most passionate and constant\r\naffection Caesonia, who was neither handsome nor young; and was besides\r\nthe mother of three daughters by another man; but a wanton of unbounded\r\nlasciviousness.  Her he would frequently exhibit to the soldiers, dressed\r\nin a military cloak, with shield and helmet, and riding by his side.  To\r\nhis friends he even showed her naked.  After she had a child, he honoured\r\nher with the title of wife; in one and the same day, declaring himself\r\nher husband, and father of the child of which she was delivered.  He\r\nnamed it Julia Drusilla, and carrying it round the temples of all the\r\ngoddesses, laid it on the lap of Minerva; to whom he recommended the care\r\nof bringing up and instructing her.  He considered her as his own child\r\nfor no better reason than her savage temper, which was such even in her\r\ninfancy, that she would attack with her nails the face and eyes of the\r\nchildren at play with her.\r\n\r\nXXVI.  It would be of little importance, as well as disgusting, to add to\r\nall this an account of the manner in which he treated his relations and\r\nfriends; as Ptolemy, king Juba’s son, his cousin (for he was the grandson\r\nof Mark Antony by his daughter Selene) [425], and especially Macro\r\nhimself, and Ennia likewise [426], by whose assistance he had obtained\r\nthe empire; all of whom, for their alliance and eminent services, he\r\nrewarded with violent deaths.  Nor was he more mild or respectful in his\r\nbehaviour towards the senate.  Some who had borne the (270) highest\r\noffices in the government, he suffered to run by his litter in their\r\ntogas for several miles together, and to attend him at supper, sometimes\r\nat the head of his couch, sometimes at his feet, with napkins.  Others of\r\nthem, after he had privately put them to death, he nevertheless continued\r\nto send for, as if they were still alive, and after a few days pretended\r\nthat they had laid violent hands upon themselves.  The consuls having\r\nforgotten to give public notice of his birth-day, he displaced them; and\r\nthe republic was three days without any one in that high office.  A\r\nquaestor who was said to be concerned in a conspiracy against him, he\r\nscourged severely, having first stripped off his clothes, and spread them\r\nunder the feet of the soldiers employed in the work, that they might\r\nstand the more firm.  The other orders likewise he treated with the same\r\ninsolence and violence.  Being disturbed by the noise of people taking\r\ntheir places at midnight in the circus, as they were to have free\r\nadmission, he drove them all away with clubs.  In this tumult, above\r\ntwenty Roman knights were squeezed to death, with as many matrons, with a\r\ngreat crowd besides.  When stage-plays were acted, to occasion disputes\r\nbetween the people and the knights, he distributed the money-tickets\r\nsooner than usual, that the seats assigned to the knights might be all\r\noccupied by the mob.  In the spectacles of gladiators, sometimes, when\r\nthe sun was violently hot, he would order the curtains, which covered the\r\namphitheatre, to be drawn aside [427], and forbad any person to be let\r\nout; withdrawing at the same time the usual apparatus for the\r\nentertainment, and presenting wild beasts almost pined to death, the most\r\nsorry gladiators, decrepit with age, and fit only to work the machinery,\r\nand decent house-keepers, who were remarkable for some bodily infirmity.\r\nSometimes shutting up the public granaries, he would oblige the people to\r\nstarve for a while.\r\n\r\nXXVII.  He evinced the savage barbarity of his temper chiefly by the\r\nfollowing indications.  When flesh was only to be had at a high price for\r\nfeeding his wild beasts reserved for the spectacles, he ordered that\r\ncriminals should be given them (271) to be devoured; and upon inspecting\r\nthem in a row, while he stood in the middle of the portico, without\r\ntroubling himself to examine their cases he ordered them to be dragged\r\naway, from “bald-pate to bald-pate.” [428]  Of one person who had made a\r\nvow for his recovery to combat with a gladiator, he exacted its\r\nperformance; nor would he allow him to desist until he came off\r\nconqueror, and after many entreaties.  Another, who had vowed to give his\r\nlife for the same cause, having shrunk from the sacrifice, he delivered,\r\nadorned as a victim, with garlands and fillets, to boys, who were to\r\ndrive him through the streets, calling on him to fulfil his vow, until he\r\nwas thrown headlong from the ramparts.  After disfiguring many persons of\r\nhonourable rank, by branding them in the face with hot irons, he\r\ncondemned them to the mines, to work in repairing the high-ways, or to\r\nfight with wild beasts; or tying them by the neck and heels, in the\r\nmanner of beasts carried to slaughter, would shut them up in cages, or\r\nsaw them asunder.  Nor were these severities merely inflicted for crimes\r\nof great enormity, but for making remarks on his public games, or for not\r\nhaving sworn by the Genius of the emperor.  He compelled parents to be\r\npresent at the execution of their sons; and to one who excused himself on\r\naccount of indisposition, he sent his own litter.  Another he invited to\r\nhis table immediately after he had witnessed the spectacle, and coolly\r\nchallenged him to jest and be merry.  He ordered the overseer of the\r\nspectacles and wild beasts to be scourged in fetters, during several days\r\nsuccessively, in his own presence, and did not put him to death until he\r\nwas disgusted with the stench of his putrefied brain.  He burned alive,\r\nin the centre of the arena of the amphitheatre, the writer of a farce,\r\nfor some witty verse, which had a double meaning.  A Roman knight, who\r\nhad been exposed to the wild beasts, crying out that he was innocent, he\r\ncalled him back, and having had his tongue cut out, remanded him to the\r\narena.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.  Asking a certain person, whom he recalled after a long exile,\r\nhow he used to spend his time, he replied, with flattery, “I was always\r\npraying the gods for what has happened, that Tiberius might die, and you\r\nbe emperor.”  Concluding, therefore, that those he had himself banished\r\nalso (272) prayed for his death, he sent orders round the islands [429]\r\nto have them all put to death.  Being very desirous to have a senator\r\ntorn to pieces, he employed some persons to call him a public enemy, fall\r\nupon him as he entered the senate-house, stab him with their styles, and\r\ndeliver him to the rest to tear asunder.  Nor was he satisfied, until he\r\nsaw the limbs and bowels of the man, after they had been dragged through\r\nthe streets, piled up in a heap before him.\r\n\r\nXXIX.  He aggravated his barbarous actions by language equally\r\noutrageous.  “There is nothing in my nature,” said he, “that I commend or\r\napprove so much, as my adiatrepsia (inflexible rigour).”  Upon his\r\ngrandmother Antonia’s giving him some advice, as if it was a small matter\r\nto pay no regard to it, he said to her, “Remember that all things are\r\nlawful for me.”  When about to murder his brother, whom he suspected of\r\ntaking antidotes against poison, he said, “See then an antidote against\r\nCaesar!”  And when he banished his sisters, he told them in a menacing\r\ntone, that he had not only islands at command, but likewise swords.  One\r\nof pretorian rank having sent several times from Anticyra [430], whither\r\nhe had gone for his health, to have his leave of absence prolonged, he\r\nordered him to be put to death; adding these words “Bleeding is necessary\r\nfor one that has taken hellebore so long, and found no benefit.”  It was\r\nhis custom every tenth day to sign the lists of prisoners appointed for\r\nexecution; and this he called “clearing his accounts.”  And having\r\ncondemned several Gauls and Greeks at one time, he exclaimed in triumph,\r\n“I have conquered Gallograecia.” [431]\r\n\r\nXXX.  He generally prolonged the sufferings of his victims by causing\r\nthem to be inflicted by slight and frequently repeated strokes; this\r\nbeing his well-known and constant order: (273) “Strike so that he may\r\nfeel himself die.”  Having punished one person for another, by mistaking\r\nhis name, he said, “he deserved it quite as much.”  He had frequently in\r\nhis mouth these words of the tragedian,\r\n\r\n    Oderint dum metuant. [432]\r\n    I scorn their hatred, if they do but fear me.\r\n\r\nHe would often inveigh against all the senators without exception, as\r\nclients of Sejanus, and informers against his mother and brothers,\r\nproducing the memorials which he had pretended to burn, and excusing the\r\ncruelty of Tiberius as necessary, since it was impossible to question the\r\nveracity of such a number of accusers [433].  He continually reproached\r\nthe whole equestrian order, as devoting themselves to nothing but acting\r\non the stage, and fighting as gladiators.  Being incensed at the people’s\r\napplauding a party at the Circensian games in opposition to him, he\r\nexclaimed, “I wish the Roman people had but one neck.” [434]  When\r\nTetrinius, the highwayman, was denounced, he said his persecutors too\r\nwere all Tetrinius’s.  Five Retiarii [435], in tunics, fighting in a\r\ncompany, yielded without a struggle to the same number of opponents; and\r\nbeing ordered to be slain, one of them taking up his lance again, killed\r\nall the conquerors.  This he lamented in a proclamation as a most cruel\r\nbutchery, and cursed all those who had borne the sight of it.\r\n\r\nXXXI.  He used also to complain aloud of the state of the times, because\r\nit was not rendered remarkable by any public (274) calamities; for, while\r\nthe reign of Augustus had been made memorable to posterity by the\r\ndisaster of Varus [436], and that of Tiberius by the fall of the theatre\r\nat Fidenae [437], his was likely to pass into oblivion, from an\r\nuninterrupted series of prosperity.  And, at times, he wished for some\r\nterrible slaughter of his troops, a famine, a pestilence, conflagrations,\r\nor an earthquake.\r\n\r\nXXXII.  Even in the midst of his diversions, while gaming or feasting,\r\nthis savage ferocity, both in his language and actions, never forsook\r\nhim.  Persons were often put to the torture in his presence, whilst he\r\nwas dining or carousing.  A soldier, who was an adept in the art of\r\nbeheading, used at such times to take off the heads of prisoners, who\r\nwere brought in for that purpose.  At Puteoli, at the dedication of the\r\nbridge which he planned, as already mentioned [438], he invited a number\r\nof people to come to him from the shore, and then suddenly, threw them\r\nheadlong into the sea; thrusting down with poles and oars those who, to\r\nsave themselves, had got hold of the rudders of the ships.  At Rome, in a\r\npublic feast, a slave having stolen some thin plates of silver with which\r\nthe couches were inlaid, he delivered him immediately to an executioner,\r\nwith orders to cut off his hands, and lead him round the guests, with\r\nthem hanging from his neck before his breast, and a label, signifying the\r\ncause of his punishment.  A gladiator who was practising with him, and\r\nvoluntarily threw himself at his feet, he stabbed with a poniard, and\r\nthen ran about with a palm branch in his hand, after the manner of those\r\nwho are victorious in the games.  When a victim was to be offered upon an\r\naltar, he, clad in the habit of the Popae [439], and holding the axe\r\naloft for a while, at last, instead of the animal, slaughtered an officer\r\nwho attended to cut up the sacrifice.  And at a sumptuous entertainment,\r\nhe fell suddenly into a violent fit of laughter, and upon the consuls,\r\nwho reclined next to him, respectfully asking him the occasion,\r\n“Nothing,” replied he, “but that, upon a single nod of mine, you might\r\nboth have your throats cut.”\r\n\r\n(275) XXXIII.  Among many other jests, this was one: As he stood by the\r\nstatue of Jupiter, he asked Apelles, the tragedian, which of them he\r\nthought was biggest?  Upon his demurring about it, he lashed him most\r\nseverely, now and then commending his voice, whilst he entreated for\r\nmercy, as being well modulated even when he was venting his grief.  As\r\noften as he kissed the neck of his wife or mistress, he would say, “So\r\nbeautiful a throat must be cut whenever I please;” and now and then he\r\nwould threaten to put his dear Caesonia to the torture, that he might\r\ndiscover why he loved her so passionately.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.  In his behaviour towards men of almost all ages, he discovered a\r\ndegree of jealousy and malignity equal to that of his cruelty and pride.\r\nHe so demolished and dispersed the statues of several illustrious\r\npersons, which had been removed by Augustus, for want of room, from the\r\ncourt of the Capitol into the Campus Martius, that it was impossible to\r\nset them up again with their inscriptions entire.  And, for the future,\r\nhe forbad any statue whatever to be erected without his knowledge and\r\nleave.  He had thoughts too of suppressing Homer’s poems: “For why,” said\r\nhe, “may not I do what Plato has done before me, who excluded him from\r\nhis commonwealth?” [440]  He was likewise very near banishing the\r\nwritings and the busts of Virgil and Livy from all libraries; censuring\r\none of them as “a man of no genius and very little learning;” and the\r\nother as “a verbose and careless historian.”  He often talked of the\r\nlawyers as if he intended to abolish their profession.  “By Hercules!”\r\n he would say, “I shall put it out of their power to answer any questions\r\nin law, otherwise than by referring to me!”\r\n\r\nXXXV.  He took from the noblest persons in the city the ancient marks of\r\ndistinction used by their families; as the collar from Torquatus [441];\r\nfrom Cincinnatus the curl of (276) hair [442]; and from Cneius Pompey,\r\nthe surname of Great, belonging to that ancient family.  Ptolemy,\r\nmentioned before, whom he invited from his kingdom, and received with\r\ngreat honours, he suddenly put to death, for no other reason, but because\r\nhe observed that upon entering the theatre, at a public exhibition, he\r\nattracted the eyes of all the spectators, by the splendour of his purple\r\nrobe.  As often as he met with handsome men, who had fine heads of hair,\r\nhe would order the back of their heads to be shaved, to make them appear\r\nridiculous.  There was one Esius Proculus, the son of a centurion of the\r\nfirst rank, who, for his great stature and fine proportions, was called\r\nthe Colossal.  Him he ordered to be dragged from his seat in the arena,\r\nand matched with a gladiator in light armour, and afterwards with another\r\ncompletely armed; and upon his worsting them both, commanded him\r\nforthwith to be bound, to be led clothed in rags up and down the streets\r\nof the city, and, after being exhibited in that plight to the women, to\r\nbe then butchered.  There was no man of so abject or mean condition,\r\nwhose excellency in any kind he did not envy.  The Rex Nemorensis [443]\r\nhaving many years enjoyed the honour of the priesthood, he procured a\r\nstill stronger antagonist to oppose him.  One Porius, who fought in a\r\nchariot [444], having been victorious in an exhibition, and in his joy\r\ngiven freedom to a slave, was applauded so vehemently, that Caligula rose\r\nin such haste from his seat, that, treading upon the hem of his toga, he\r\ntumbled down the steps, full of indignation, (277) and crying out, “A\r\npeople who are masters of the world, pay greater respect to a gladiator\r\nfor a trifle, than to princes admitted amongst the gods, or to my own\r\nmajesty here present amongst them.”\r\n\r\nXXXVI.  He never had the least regard either to the chastity of his own\r\nperson, or that of others.  He is said to have been inflamed with an\r\nunnatural passion for Marcus Lepidus Mnester, an actor in pantomimes, and\r\nfor certain hostages; and to have engaged with them in the practice of\r\nmutual pollution.  Valerius Catullus, a young man of a consular family,\r\nbawled aloud in public that he had been exhausted by him in that\r\nabominable act.  Besides his incest with his sisters, and his notorious\r\npassion for Pyrallis, the prostitute, there was hardly any lady of\r\ndistinction with whom he did not make free.  He used commonly to invite\r\nthem with their husbands to supper, and as they passed by the couch on\r\nwhich he reclined at table, examine them very closely, like those who\r\ntraffic in slaves; and if any one from modesty held down her face, he\r\nraised it up with his hand.  Afterwards, as often as he was in the\r\nhumour, he would quit the room, send for her he liked best, and in a\r\nshort time return with marks of recent disorder about them.  He would\r\nthen commend or disparage her in the presence of the company, recounting\r\nthe charms or defects of her person and behaviour in private.  To some he\r\nsent a divorce in the name of their absent husbands, and ordered it to be\r\nregistered in the public acts.\r\n\r\nXXXVII.  In the devices of his profuse expenditure, he surpassed all the\r\nprodigals that ever lived; inventing a new kind of bath, with strange\r\ndishes and suppers, washing in precious unguents, both warm and cold,\r\ndrinking pearls of immense value dissolved in vinegar, and serving up for\r\nhis guests loaves and other victuals modelled in gold; often saying,\r\n“that a man ought either to be a good economist or an emperor.”  Besides,\r\nhe scattered money to a prodigious amount among the people, from the top\r\nof the Julian Basilica [445], during several days successively.  He built\r\ntwo ships with ten banks of oars, after the Liburnian fashion, the poops\r\nof which blazed with jewels, and the sails were of various parti-colours.\r\nThey were fitted up with ample baths, galleries, and saloons, and\r\nsupplied with a great variety of vines and other fruit-trees.  In these\r\nhe would sail in the day-time along the coast of Campania, feasting (278)\r\namidst dancing and concerts of music.  In building his palaces and\r\nvillas, there was nothing he desired to effect so much, in defiance of\r\nall reason, as what was considered impossible.  Accordingly, moles were\r\nformed in the deep and adverse sea [446], rocks of the hardest stone cut\r\naway, plains raised to the height of mountains with a vast mass of earth,\r\nand the tops of mountains levelled by digging; and all these were to be\r\nexecuted with incredible speed, for the least remissness was a capital\r\noffence.  Not to mention particulars, he spent enormous sums, and the\r\nwhole treasures which had been amassed by Tiberius Caesar, amounting to\r\ntwo thousand seven hundred millions of sesterces, within less than a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.  Having therefore quite exhausted these funds, and being in want\r\nof money, he had recourse to plundering the people, by every mode of\r\nfalse accusation, confiscation, and taxation, that could be invented.  He\r\ndeclared that no one had any right to the freedom of Rome, although their\r\nancestors had acquired it for themselves and their posterity, unless they\r\nwere sons; for that none beyond that degree ought to be considered as\r\nposterity.  When the grants of the Divine Julius and Augustus were\r\nproduced to him, he only said, that he was very sorry they were obsolete\r\nand out of date.  He also charged all those with making false returns,\r\nwho, after the taking of the census, had by any means whatever increased\r\ntheir property.  He annulled the wills of all who had been centurions of\r\nthe first rank, as testimonies of their base ingratitude, if from the\r\nbeginning of Tiberius’s reign they had not left either that prince or\r\nhimself their heir.  He also set aside the wills of all others, if any\r\nperson only pretended to say, that they designed at their death to leave\r\nCaesar their heir.  The public becoming terrified at this proceeding, he\r\nwas now appointed joint-heir with their friends, and in the case of\r\nparents with their children, by persons unknown to him.  Those who lived\r\nany considerable time after making such a will, he said, were only making\r\ngame of him; and accordingly he sent many of them poisoned cakes.  He\r\nused to try such causes himself; fixing previously the sum he proposed to\r\nraise during the sitting, and, after he had secured it, quitting the\r\ntribunal.  Impatient of the least delay, he condemned by a single\r\nsentence forty (279) persons, against whom there were different charges;\r\nboasting to Caesonia when she awoke, “how much business he had dispatched\r\nwhile she was taking her mid-day sleep.”  He exposed to sale by auction,\r\nthe remains of the apparatus used in the public spectacles; and exacted\r\nsuch biddings, and raised the prices so high, that some of the purchasers\r\nwere ruined, and bled themselves to death.  There is a well-known story\r\ntold of Aponius Saturninus, who happening to fall asleep as he sat on a\r\nbench at the sale, Caius called out to the auctioneer, not to overlook\r\nthe praetorian personage who nodded to him so often; and accordingly the\r\nsalesman went on, pretending to take the nods for tokens of assent, until\r\nthirteen gladiators were knocked down to him at the sum of nine millions\r\nof sesterces [447], he being in total ignorance of what was doing.\r\n\r\nXXXIX.  Having also sold in Gaul all the clothes, furniture, slaves, and\r\neven freedmen belonging to his sisters, at prodigious prices, after their\r\ncondemnation, he was so much delighted with his gains, that he sent to\r\nRome for all the furniture of the old palace [448]; pressing for its\r\nconveyance all the carriages let to hire in the city, with the horses and\r\nmules belonging to the bakers, so that they often wanted bread at Rome;\r\nand many who had suits at law in progress, lost their causes, because\r\nthey could not make their appearance in due time according to their\r\nrecognizances.  In the sale of this furniture, every artifice of fraud\r\nand imposition was employed.  Sometimes he would rail at the bidders for\r\nbeing niggardly, and ask them “if they were not ashamed to be richer than\r\nhe was?” at another, he would affect to be sorry that the property of\r\nprinces should be passing into the hands of private persons.  He had\r\nfound out that a rich provincial had given two hundred thousand sesterces\r\nto his chamberlains for an underhand invitation to his table, and he was\r\nmuch pleased to find that honour valued at so high a rate.  The day\r\nfollowing, as the same person was sitting at the sale, he sent him some\r\nbauble, for which he told him he must pay two hundred thousand sesterces,\r\nand “that he should sup with Caesar upon his own invitation.”\r\n\r\n(280) XL.  He levied new taxes, and such as were never before known, at\r\nfirst by the publicans, but afterwards, because their profit was\r\nenormous, by centurions and tribunes of the pretorian guards; no\r\ndescription of property or persons being exempted from some kind of tax\r\nor other.  For all eatables brought into the city, a certain excise was\r\nexacted: for all law-suits or trials in whatever court, the fortieth part\r\nof the sum in dispute; and such as were convicted of compromising\r\nlitigations, were made liable to a penalty.  Out of the daily wages of\r\nthe porters, he received an eighth, and from the gains of common\r\nprostitutes, what they received for one favour granted.  There was a\r\nclause in the law, that all bawds who kept women for prostitution or\r\nsale, should be liable to pay, and that marriage itself should not be\r\nexempted.\r\n\r\nXLI.  These taxes being imposed, but the act by which they were levied\r\nnever submitted to public inspection, great grievances were experienced\r\nfrom the want of sufficient knowledge of the law.  At length, on the\r\nurgent demands of the Roman people, he published the law, but it was\r\nwritten in a very small hand, and posted up in a corner, so that no one\r\ncould make a copy of it.  To leave no sort of gain untried, he opened\r\nbrothels in the Palatium, with a number of cells, furnished suitably to\r\nthe dignity of the place; in which married women and free-born youths\r\nwere ready for the reception of visitors.  He sent likewise his\r\nnomenclators about the forums and courts, to invite people of all ages,\r\nthe old as well as the young, to his brothel, to come and satisfy their\r\nlusts; and he was ready to lend his customers money upon interest; clerks\r\nattending to take down their names in public, as persons who contributed\r\nto the emperor’s revenue.  Another method of raising money, which he\r\nthought not below his notice, was gaming; which, by the help of lying and\r\nperjury, he turned to considerable account.  Leaving once the management\r\nof his play to his partner in the game, he stepped into the court, and\r\nobserving two rich Roman knights passing by, he ordered them immediately\r\nto be seized, and their estates confiscated.  Then returning, in great\r\nglee, he boasted that he had never made a better throw in his life.\r\n\r\nXLII.  After the birth of his daughter, complaining of his (281) poverty,\r\nand the burdens to which he was subjected, not only as an emperor, but a\r\nfather, he made a general collection for her maintenance and fortune.  He\r\nlikewise gave public notice, that he would receive new-year’s gifts on\r\nthe calends of January following; and accordingly stood in the vestibule\r\nof his house, to clutch the presents which people of all ranks threw down\r\nbefore him by handfuls and lapfuls.  At last, being seized with an\r\ninvincible desire of feeling money, taking off his slippers, he\r\nrepeatedly walked over great heaps of gold coin spread upon the spacious\r\nfloor, and then laying himself down, rolled his whole body in gold over\r\nand over again.\r\n\r\nXLIII.  Only once in his life did he take an active part in military\r\naffairs, and then not from any set purpose, but during his journey to\r\nMevania, to see the grove and river of Clitumnus [449].  Being\r\nrecommended to recruit a body of Batavians, who attended him, he resolved\r\nupon an expedition into Germany.  Immediately he drew together several\r\nlegions, and auxiliary forces from all quarters, and made every where new\r\nlevies with the utmost rigour.  Collecting supplies of all kinds, such as\r\nnever had been assembled upon the like occasion, he set forward on his\r\nmarch, and pursued it sometimes with so much haste and precipitation,\r\nthat the pretorian cohorts were obliged, contrary to custom, to pack\r\ntheir standards on horses or mules, and so follow him.  At other times,\r\nhe would march so slow and luxuriously, that he was carried in a litter\r\nby eight men; ordering the roads to be swept by the people of the\r\nneighbouring towns, and sprinkled with water to lay the dust.\r\n\r\nXLIV.  On arriving at the camp, in order to show himself an active\r\ngeneral, and severe disciplinarian, he cashiered the lieutenants who came\r\nup late with the auxiliary forces from different quarters.  In reviewing\r\nthe army, he deprived of their companies most of the centurions of the\r\nfirst rank, who had now served their legal time in the wars, and some\r\nwhose time would have expired in a few days; alleging against them their\r\nage and infirmity; and railing at the covetous disposition (282) of the\r\nrest of them, he reduced the bounty due to those who had served out their\r\ntime to the sum of six thousand sesterces.  Though he only received the\r\nsubmission of Adminius, the son of Cunobeline, a British king, who being\r\ndriven from his native country by his father, came over to him with a\r\nsmall body of troops [450], yet, as if the whole island had been\r\nsurrendered to him, he dispatched magnificent letters to Rome, ordering\r\nthe bearers to proceed in their carriages directly up to the forum and\r\nthe senate-house, and not to deliver the letters but to the consuls in\r\nthe temple of Mars, and in the presence of a full assembly of the\r\nsenators.\r\n\r\nXLV.  Soon after this, there being no hostilities, he ordered a few\r\nGermans of his guard to be carried over and placed in concealment on the\r\nother side of the Rhine, and word to be brought him after dinner, that an\r\nenemy was advancing with great impetuosity.  This being accordingly done,\r\nhe immediately threw himself, with his friends, and a party of the\r\npretorian knights, into the adjoining wood, where lopping branches from\r\nthe trees, and forming trophies of them, he returned by torch-light,\r\nupbraiding those who did not follow him, with timorousness and cowardice;\r\nbut he presented the companions, and sharers of his victory with crowns\r\nof a new form, and under a new name, having the sun, moon, and stars\r\nrepresented on them, and which he called Exploratoriae.  Again, some\r\nhostages were by his order taken from the school, and privately sent off;\r\nupon notice of which he immediately rose from table, pursued them with\r\nthe cavalry, as if they had run away, and coming up with them, brought\r\nthem back in fetters; proceeding to an extravagant pitch of ostentation\r\nlikewise in this military comedy.  Upon his again sitting down to table,\r\nit being reported to him that the troops were all reassembled, he ordered\r\nthem to sit down as they were, in their armour, animating them in the\r\nwords of that well-known verse of Virgil:\r\n\r\n    (283) Durate, et vosmet rebus servate secundis.--Aen. 1.\r\n    Bear up, and save yourselves for better days.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, he reprimanded the senate and people of Rome in a very\r\nsevere proclamation, “For revelling and frequenting the diversions of the\r\ncircus and theatre, and enjoying themselves at their villas, whilst their\r\nemperor was fighting, and exposing himself to the greatest dangers.”\r\n\r\nXLVI.  At last, as if resolved to make war in earnest, he drew up his\r\narmy upon the shore of the ocean, with his balistae and other engines of\r\nwar, and while no one could imagine what he intended to do, on a sudden\r\ncommanded them to gather up the sea shells, and fill their helmets, and\r\nthe folds of their dress with them, calling them “the spoils of the ocean\r\ndue to the Capitol and the Palatium.”  As a monument of his success, he\r\nraised a lofty tower, upon which, as at Pharos [451], he ordered lights\r\nto be burnt in the night-time, for the direction of ships at sea; and\r\nthen promising the soldiers a donative of a hundred denarii [452] a man,\r\nas if he had surpassed the most eminent examples of generosity, “Go your\r\nways,” said he, “and be merry: go, ye are rich.”\r\n\r\nXLVII.  In making preparations for his triumph, besides the prisoners and\r\ndeserters from the barbarian armies, he picked out the men of greatest\r\nstature in all Gaul, such as he said were fittest to grace a triumph,\r\nwith some of the chiefs, and reserved them to appear in the procession;\r\nobliging them not only to dye their hair yellow, and let it grow long,\r\nbut to learn the German language, and assume the names commonly used in\r\nthat country.  He ordered likewise the gallies in which he had entered\r\nthe ocean, to be conveyed to Rome a great part of the way by land, and\r\nwrote to his comptrollers in the city, “to make proper preparations for a\r\ntriumph against (284) his arrival, at as small expense as possible; but\r\non a scale such as had never been seen before, since they had full power\r\nover the property of every one.”\r\n\r\nXLVIII.  Before he left the province, he formed a design of the most\r\nhorrid cruelty--to massacre the legions which had mutinied upon the death\r\nof Augustus, for seizing and detaining by force his father, Germanicus,\r\ntheir commander, and himself, then an infant, in the camp.  Though he was\r\nwith great difficulty dissuaded from this rash attempt, yet neither the\r\nmost urgent entreaties nor representations could prevent him from\r\npersisting in the design of decimating these legions.  Accordingly, he\r\nordered them to assemble unarmed, without so much as their swords; and\r\nthen surrounded them with armed horse.  But finding that many of them,\r\nsuspecting that violence was intended, were making off, to arm in their\r\nown defence, he quitted the assembly as fast as he could, and immediately\r\nmarched for Rome; bending now all his fury against the senate, whom he\r\npublicly threatened, to divert the general attention from the clamour\r\nexcited by his disgraceful conduct.  Amongst other pretexts of offence,\r\nhe complained that he was defrauded of a triumph, which was justly his\r\ndue, though he had just before forbidden, upon pain of death, any honour\r\nto be decreed him.\r\n\r\nXLIX.  In his march he was waited upon by deputies from the senatorian\r\norder, entreating him to hasten his return.  He replied to them, “I will\r\ncome, I will come, and this with me,” striking at the same time the hilt\r\nof his sword.  He issued likewise this proclamation: “I am coming, but\r\nfor those only who wish for me, the equestrian order and the people; for\r\nI shall no longer treat the senate as their fellow-citizen or prince.”\r\n He forbad any of the senators to come to meet him; and either abandoning\r\nor deferring his triumph, he entered the city in ovation on his\r\nbirthday.  Within four months from this period he was slain, after he had\r\nperpetrated enormous crimes, and while he was meditating the execution,\r\nif possible, of still greater.  He had entertained a design of removing\r\nto Antium, and afterwards to Alexandria; having first cut off the flower\r\nof the equestrian and senatorian orders.  This is placed beyond all\r\nquestion, by two books which were found in his cabinet (285) under\r\ndifferent titles; one being called the sword, and the other, the dagger.\r\nThey both contained private marks, and the names of those who were\r\ndevoted to death.  There was also found a large chest, filled with a\r\nvariety of poisons which being afterwards thrown into the sea by order of\r\nClaudius, are said to have so infected the waters, that the fish were\r\npoisoned, and cast dead by the tide upon the neighbouring shores.\r\n\r\nL.  He was tall, of a pale complexion, ill-shaped, his neck and legs very\r\nslender, his eyes and temples hollow, his brows broad and knit, his hair\r\nthin, and the crown of the head bald.  The other parts of his body were\r\nmuch covered with hair.  On this account, it was reckoned a capital crime\r\nfor any person to look down from above, as he was passing by, or so much\r\nas to name a goat.  His countenance, which was naturally hideous and\r\nfrightful, he purposely rendered more so, forming it before a mirror into\r\nthe most horrible contortions.  He was crazy both in body and mind, being\r\nsubject, when a boy, to the falling sickness.  When he arrived at the age\r\nof manhood, he endured fatigue tolerably well; but still, occasionally,\r\nhe was liable to a faintness, during which he remained incapable of any\r\neffort.  He was not insensible of the disorder of his mind, and sometimes\r\nhad thoughts of retiring to clear his brain [453].  It is believed that\r\nhis wife Caesonia administered to him a love potion which threw him into\r\na frenzy.  What most of all disordered him, was want of sleep, for he\r\nseldom had more than three or four hours’ rest in a night; and even then\r\nhis sleep was not sound, but disturbed by strange dreams; fancying, among\r\nother things, that a form representing the ocean spoke to him.  Being\r\ntherefore often weary with lying awake so long, sometimes he sat up in\r\nhis bed, at others, walked in the longest porticos about the house, and\r\nfrom time to time, invoked and looked out for the approach of day.\r\n\r\nLI.  To this crazy constitution of his mind may, I think, very justly be\r\nascribed two faults which he had, of a nature directly repugnant one to\r\nthe other, namely, an excessive confidence and the most abject timidity.\r\nFor he, who affected so (286) much to despise the gods, was ready to shut\r\nhis eyes, and wrap up his head in his cloak at the slightest storm of\r\nthunder and lightning; and if it was violent, he got up and hid himself\r\nunder his bed.  In his visit to Sicily, after ridiculing many strange\r\nobjects which that country affords, he ran away suddenly in the night\r\nfrom Messini, terrified by the smoke and rumbling at the summit of Mount\r\nAetna.  And though in words he was very valiant against the barbarians,\r\nyet upon passing a narrow defile in Germany in his light car, surrounded\r\nby a strong body of his troops, some one happening to say, “There would\r\nbe no small consternation amongst us, if an enemy were to appear,” he\r\nimmediately mounted his horse, and rode towards the bridges in great\r\nhaste; but finding them blocked up with camp-followers and\r\nbaggage-waggons, he was in such a hurry, that he caused himself to be\r\ncarried in men’s hands over the heads of the crowd.  Soon afterwards, upon\r\nhearing that the Germans were again in rebellion, he prepared to quit\r\nRome, and equipped a fleet; comforting himself with this consideration,\r\nthat if the enemy should prove victorious, and possess themselves of the\r\nheights of the Alps, as the Cimbri [454] had done, or of the city, as the\r\nSenones [455] formerly did, he should still have in reserve the\r\ntransmarine provinces [456].  Hence it was, I suppose, that it occurred to\r\nhis assassins, to invent the story intended to pacify the troops who\r\nmutinied at his death, that he had laid violent hands upon himself, in a\r\nfit of terror occasioned by the news brought him of the defeat of his\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nLII.  In the fashion of his clothes, shoes, and all the rest of his\r\ndress, he did not wear what was either national, or properly civic, or\r\npeculiar to the male sex, or appropriate to mere mortals.  He often\r\nappeared abroad in a short coat of stout cloth, richly embroidered and\r\nblazing with jewels, in a tunic with sleeves, and with bracelets upon his\r\narms; sometimes all in silks and (287) habited like a woman; at other\r\ntimes in the crepidae or buskins; sometimes in the sort of shoes used by\r\nthe light-armed soldiers, or in the sock used by women, and commonly with\r\na golden beard fixed to his chin, holding in his hand a thunderbolt, a\r\ntrident, or a caduceus, marks of distinction belonging to the gods only.\r\nSometimes, too, he appeared in the habit of Venus.  He wore very commonly\r\nthe triumphal ornaments, even before his expedition, and sometimes the\r\nbreast-plate of Alexander the Great, taken out of his coffin. [457]\r\n\r\nLIII.  With regard to the liberal sciences, he was little conversant in\r\nphilology, but applied himself with assiduity to the study of eloquence,\r\nbeing indeed in point of enunciation tolerably elegant and ready; and in\r\nhis perorations, when he was moved to anger, there was an abundant flow\r\nof words and periods.  In speaking, his action was vehement, and his\r\nvoice so strong, that he was heard at a great distance.  When winding up\r\nan harangue, he threatened to draw “the sword of his lucubration,”\r\n holding a loose and smooth style in such contempt, that he said Seneca,\r\nwho was then much admired, “wrote only detached essays,” and that “his\r\nlanguage was nothing but sand without lime.”  He often wrote answers to\r\nthe speeches of successful orators; and employed himself in composing\r\naccusations or vindications of eminent persons, who were impeached before\r\nthe senate; and gave his vote for or against the party accused, according\r\nto his success in speaking, inviting the equestrian order, by\r\nproclamation, to hear him.\r\n\r\nLIV.  He also zealously applied himself to the practice of several other\r\narts of different kinds, such as fencing, charioteering, singing, and\r\ndancing.  In the first of these, he practised with the weapons used in\r\nwar; and drove the chariot in circuses built in several places.  He was\r\nso extremely fond of singing and dancing, that he could not refrain in\r\nthe theatre from singing with the tragedians, and imitating the gestures\r\nof the actors, either by way of applause or correction.  A night\r\nexhibition which he had ordered the day he was slain, was thought to be\r\nintended for no other reason, than to take the opportunity afforded by\r\nthe licentiousness of the season, to make his first appearance upon the\r\nstage.  Sometimes, also, (288) he danced in the night.  Summoning once to\r\nthe Palatium, in the second watch of the night [458], three men of\r\nconsular rank, who feared the words from the message, he placed them on\r\nthe proscenium of the stage, and then suddenly came bursting out, with a\r\nloud noise of flutes and castanets [459], dressed in a mantle and tunic\r\nreaching down to his heels.  Having danced out a song, he retired.  Yet\r\nhe who had acquired such dexterity in other exercises, never learnt to\r\nswim.\r\n\r\nLV.  Those for whom he once conceived a regard, he favoured even to\r\nmadness.  He used to kiss Mnester, the pantomimic actor, publicly in the\r\ntheatre; and if any person made the least noise while he was dancing, he\r\nwould order him to be dragged from his seat, and scourged him with his\r\nown hand.  A Roman knight once making some bustle, he sent him, by a\r\ncenturion, an order to depart forthwith for Ostia [460], and carry a\r\nletter from him to king Ptolemy in Mauritania.  The letter was comprised\r\nin these words: “Do neither good nor harm to the bearer.”  He made some\r\ngladiators captains of his German guards.  He deprived the gladiators\r\ncalled Mirmillones of some of their arms.  One Columbus coming off with\r\nvictory in a combat, but being slightly wounded, he ordered some poison\r\nto be infused in the wound, which he thence called Columbinum.  For thus\r\nit was certainly named with his own hand in a list of other poisons.  He\r\nwas so extravagantly fond of the party of charioteers whose colours were\r\ngreen [461], that he supped and lodged for some time constantly in the\r\nstable where their horses were kept.  At a certain revel, he made a\r\npresent of two millions of sesterces to one Cythicus, a driver of a\r\nchariot.  The day before the Circensian games, he used to send his\r\nsoldiers to enjoin silence in the (289) neighbourhood, that the repose of\r\nhis horse Incitatus [462] might not be disturbed.  For this favourite\r\nanimal, besides a marble stable, an ivory manger, purple housings, and a\r\njewelled frontlet, he appointed a house, with a retinue of slaves, and\r\nfine furniture, for the reception of such as were invited in the horse’s\r\nname to sup with him.  It is even said that he intended to make him\r\nconsul.\r\n\r\nLVI.  In this frantic and savage career, numbers had formed designs for\r\ncutting him off; but one or two conspiracies being discovered, and others\r\npostponed for want of opportunity, at last two men concerted a plan\r\ntogether, and accomplished their purpose; not without the privity of some\r\nof the greatest favourites amongst his freedmen, and the prefects of the\r\npretorian guards; because, having been named, though falsely, as\r\nconcerned in one conspiracy against him, they perceived that they were\r\nsuspected and become objects of his hatred.  For he had immediately\r\nendeavoured to render them obnoxious to the soldiery, drawing his sword,\r\nand declaring, “That he would kill himself if they thought him worthy of\r\ndeath;” and ever after he was continually accusing them to one another,\r\nand setting them all mutually at variance.  The conspirators having\r\nresolved to fall upon him as he returned at noon from the Palatine games,\r\nCassius Chaerea, tribune of the pretorian guards, claimed the part of\r\nmaking the onset.  This Chaerea was now an elderly man, and had been\r\noften reproached by Caius for effeminacy.  When he came for the\r\nwatchword, the latter would give “Priapus,” or “Venus;” and if on any\r\noccasion he returned thanks, would offer him his hand to kiss, making\r\nwith his fingers an obscene gesture.\r\n\r\nLVII.  His approaching fate was indicated by many prodigies.  The statue\r\nof Jupiter at Olympia, which he had ordered to be taken down and brought\r\nto Rome, suddenly burst out into such a violent fit of laughter, that,\r\nthe machines employed in the work giving way, the workmen took to their\r\nheels.  When this accident happened, there came up a man named Cassius,\r\nwho said that he was commanded in a dream to sacrifice a bull to Jupiter.\r\nThe Capitol at Capua was (290) struck with lightning upon the ides of\r\nMarch [15th March] as was also, at Rome, the apartment of the chief\r\nporter of the Palatium.  Some construed the latter into a presage that\r\nthe master of the place was in danger from his own guards; and the other\r\nthey regarded as a sign, that an illustrious person would be cut off, as\r\nhad happened before on that day.  Sylla, the astrologer, being, consulted\r\nby him respecting his nativity, assured him, “That death would\r\nunavoidably and speedily befall him.”  The oracle of Fortune at Antium\r\nlikewise forewarned him of Cassius; on which account he had given orders\r\nfor putting to death Cassius Longinus, at that time proconsul of Asia,\r\nnot considering that Chaerea bore also that name.  The day preceding his\r\ndeath he dreamt that he was standing in heaven near the throne of\r\nJupiter, who giving him a push with the great toe of his right foot, he\r\nfell headlong upon the earth.  Some things which happened the very day of\r\nhis death, and only a little before it, were likewise considered as\r\nominous presages of that event.  Whilst he was at sacrifice, he was\r\nbespattered with the blood of a flamingo.  And Mnester, the pantomimic\r\nactor, performed in a play, which the tragedian Neoptolemus had formerly\r\nacted at the games in which Philip, the king of Macedon, was slain.  And\r\nin the piece called Laureolus, in which the principal actor, running out\r\nin a hurry, and falling, vomited blood, several of the inferior actors\r\nvying with each other to give the best specimen of their art, made the\r\nwhole stage flow with blood.  A spectacle had been purposed to be\r\nperformed that night, in which the fables of the infernal regions were to\r\nbe represented by Egyptians and Ethiopians.\r\n\r\nLVIII.  On the ninth of the calends of February [24th January], and about\r\nthe seventh hour of the day, after hesitating whether he should rise to\r\ndinner, as his stomach was disordered by what he had eaten the day\r\nbefore, at last, by the advice of his friends, he came forth.  In the\r\nvaulted passage through which he had to pass, were some boys of noble\r\nextraction, who had been brought from Asia to act upon the stage, waiting\r\nfor him in a private corridor, and he stopped to see and speak to them;\r\nand had not the leader of the party said that he was suffering from cold,\r\nhe would have gone back, and made them act immediately.  Respecting what\r\nfollowed, (291) two different accounts are given.  Some say, that, whilst\r\nhe was speaking to the boys, Chaerea came behind him, and gave him a\r\nheavy blow on the neck with his sword, first crying out, “Take this:”\r\n that then a tribune, by name Cornelius Sabinus, another of the\r\nconspirators, ran him through the breast.  Others say, that the crowd\r\nbeing kept at a distance by some centurions who were in the plot, Sabinus\r\ncame, according to custom, for the word, and that Caius gave him\r\n“Jupiter,” upon which Chaerea cried out, “Be it so!” and then, on his\r\nlooking round, clove one of his jaws with a blow.  As he lay on the\r\nground, crying out that he was still alive [463], the rest dispatched him\r\nwith thirty wounds.  For the word agreed upon among them all was, “Strike\r\nagain.”  Some likewise ran their swords through his privy parts.  Upon\r\nthe first bustle, the litter bearers came running in with their poles to\r\nhis assistance, and, immediately afterwards, his German body guards, who\r\nkilled some of the assassins, and also some senators who had no concern\r\nin the affair.\r\n\r\nLIX.  He lived twenty-nine years, and reigned three years, ten months,\r\nand eight days.  His body was carried privately into the Lamian Gardens\r\n[464], where it was half burnt upon a pile hastily raised, and then had\r\nsome earth carelessly thrown over it.  It was afterwards disinterred by\r\nhis sisters, on their return from banishment, burnt to ashes, and buried.\r\nBefore this was done, it is well known that the keepers of the gardens\r\nwere greatly disturbed by apparitions; and that not a night passed\r\nwithout some terrible alarm or other in the house where he was slain,\r\nuntil it was destroyed by fire.  His wife Caesonia was killed with him,\r\nbeing stabbed by a centurion; and his daughter had her brains knocked out\r\nagainst a wall.\r\n\r\nLX.  Of the miserable condition of those times, any person (292) may\r\neasily form an estimate from the following circumstances.  When his death\r\nwas made public, it was not immediately credited.  People entertained a\r\nsuspicion that a report of his being killed had been contrived and spread\r\nby himself, with the view of discovering how they stood affected towards\r\nhim.  Nor had the conspirators fixed upon any one to succeed him.  The\r\nsenators were so unanimous in their resolution to assert the liberty of\r\ntheir country, that the consuls assembled them at first not in the usual\r\nplace of meeting, because it was named after Julius Caesar, but in the\r\nCapitol.  Some proposed to abolish the memory of the Caesars, and level\r\ntheir temples with the ground.  It was particularly remarked on this\r\noccasion, that all the Caesars, who had the praenomen of Caius, died by\r\nthe sword, from the Caius Caesar who was slain in the times of Cinna.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a great chasm in the Annals of Tacitus, at this period,\r\nprecludes all information from that historian respecting the reign of\r\nCaligula; but from what he mentions towards the close of the preceding\r\nchapter, it is evident that Caligula was forward to seize the reins of\r\ngovernment, upon the death of Tiberius, whom, though he rivalled him in\r\nhis vices, he was far from imitating in his dissimulation.  Amongst the\r\npeople, the remembrance of Germanicus’ virtues cherished for his family\r\nan attachment which was probably, increased by its misfortunes; and they\r\nwere anxious to see revived in the son the popularity of the father.\r\nConsidering, however, that Caligula’s vicious disposition was already\r\nknown, and that it had even been an inducement with Tiberius to procure\r\nhis succession, in order that it might prove a foil to his own memory; it\r\nis surprising that no effort was made at this juncture to shake off the\r\ndespotism which had been so intolerable in the last reign, and restore\r\nthe ancient liberty of the republic.  Since the commencement of the\r\nimperial dominion, there never had been any period so favourable for a\r\ncounter-revolution as the present crisis.  There existed now no Livia, to\r\ninfluence the minds of the senate and people in respect of the\r\ngovernment; nor was there any other person allied to the family of\r\nGermanicus, whose countenance or intrigues could promote the views of\r\nCaligula.  He himself was now only in the twenty-fifth year of his age,\r\nwas totally inexperienced in the administration of public affairs, had\r\nnever performed even the smallest service to his country, and was\r\ngenerally known to be of a character which (293) disgraced his\r\nillustrious descent.  Yet, in spite of all these circumstances, such was\r\nthe destiny of Rome, that his accession afforded joy to the soldiers, who\r\nhad known him in his childhood, and to the populace in the capital, as\r\nwell as the people in the provinces, who were flattered with the delusive\r\nexpectation of receiving a prince who should adorn the throne with the\r\namiable virtues of Germanicus.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to say, whether weakness of understanding, or corruption\r\nof morals, were more conspicuous in the character of Caligula.  He seems\r\nto have discovered from his earliest years an innate depravity of mind,\r\nwhich was undoubtedly much increased by defect of education.  He had lost\r\nboth his parents at an early period of life; and from Tiberius’ own\r\ncharacter, as well as his views in training the person who should succeed\r\nhim on the throne, there is reason to think, that if any attention\r\nwhatever was paid to the education of Caligula, it was directed to\r\nvitiate all his faculties and passions, rather than to correct and\r\nimprove them.  If such was really the object, it was indeed prosecuted\r\nwith success.\r\n\r\nThe commencement, however, of his reign was such as by no means\r\nprognosticated its subsequent transition.  The sudden change of his\r\nconduct, the astonishing mixture of imbecility and presumption, of moral\r\nturpitude and frantic extravagance, which he afterwards evinced; such as\r\nrolling himself over heaps of gold, his treatment of his horse Incitatus,\r\nand his design of making him consul, seem to justify a suspicion that his\r\nbrain had actually been affected, either by the potion, said to have been\r\ngiven him by his wife Caesonia, or otherwise.  Philtres, or love-potions,\r\nas they were called, were frequent in those times; and the people\r\nbelieved that they operated upon the mind by a mysterious and sympathetic\r\npower.  It is, however, beyond a doubt, that their effects were produced\r\nentirely by the action of their physical qualities upon the organs of the\r\nbody.  They were usually made of the satyrion, which, according to Pliny,\r\nwas a provocative.  They were generally given by women to their husbands\r\nat bed-time; and it was necessary towards their successful operation,\r\nthat the parties should sleep together.  This circumstance explains the\r\nwhole mystery.  The philtres were nothing more than medicines of a\r\nstimulating quality, which, after exciting violent, but temporary\r\neffects, enfeebled the constitution, and occasioned nervous disorders, by\r\nwhich the mental faculties, as well as the corporeal, might be injured.\r\nThat this was really the case with Caligula, seems probable, not only\r\nfrom the falling sickness, to which he was subject, but from the habitual\r\nwakefulness of which he complained.\r\n\r\n(294) The profusion of this emperor, during his short reign of three\r\nyears and ten months, is unexampled in history.  In the midst of profound\r\npeace, without any extraordinary charges either civil or military, he\r\nexpended, in less than one year, besides the current revenue of the\r\nempire, the sum of 21,796,875 pounds sterling, which had been left by\r\nTiberius at his death.  To supply the extravagance of future years, new\r\nand exorbitant taxes were imposed upon the people, and those too on the\r\nnecessaries of life.  There existed now amongst the Romans every motive\r\nthat could excite a general indignation against the government; yet such\r\nwas still the dread of imperial power, though vested in the hands of so\r\nweak and despicable a sovereign, that no insurrection was attempted, nor\r\nany extensive conspiracy formed; but the obnoxious emperor fell at last a\r\nsacrifice to a few centurions of his own guard.\r\n\r\nThis reign was of too short duration to afford any new productions in\r\nliterature; but, had it been extended to a much longer period, the\r\neffects would probably have been the same.  Polite learning never could\r\nflourish under an emperor who entertained a design of destroying the\r\nwritings of Virgil and Livy.  It is fortunate that these, and other\r\nvaluable productions of antiquity, were too widely diffused over the\r\nworld, and too carefully preserved, to be in danger of perishing through\r\nthe frenzy of this capricious barbarian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIBERIUS CLAUDIUS DRUSUS CAESAR. [465]\r\n\r\n(295)\r\n\r\nI.  Livia, having married Augustus when she was pregnant, was within\r\nthree months afterwards delivered of Drusus, the father of Claudius\r\nCaesar, who had at first the praenomen of Decimus, but afterwards that of\r\nNero; and it was suspected that he was begotten in adultery by his\r\nfather-in-law.  The following verse, however, was immediately in every\r\none’s mouth:\r\n\r\n    Tois eutychousi kai primaena paidia.\r\n\r\n    Nine months for common births the fates decree;\r\n    But, for the great, reduce the term to three.\r\n\r\nThis Drusus, during the time of his being quaestor and praetor, commanded\r\nin the Rhaetian and German wars, and was the first of all the Roman\r\ngenerals who navigated the Northern Ocean [466].  He made likewise some\r\nprodigious trenches beyond the Rhine [467], which to this day are called\r\nby his name.  He overthrew the enemy in several battles, and drove them\r\nfar back into the depths of the desert.  Nor did he desist from pursuing\r\nthem, until an apparition, in the form of a barbarian woman, of more than\r\nhuman size, appeared to him, and, in the Latin tongue, forbad him to\r\nproceed any farther.  For these achievements he had the honour of an\r\novation, and the triumphal ornaments.  After his praetorship, he\r\nimmediately entered on the office of consul, and returning again to\r\nGermany, died of disease, in the summer encampment, which thence obtained\r\nthe name of “The Unlucky Camp.”  His corpse was carried to Rome by the\r\nprincipal persons of the several municipalities and colonies upon the\r\nroad, being met and received by the recorders of each place, and buried\r\nin the Campus Martius.  In honour of his (296) memory, the army erected a\r\nmonument, round which the soldiers used, annually, upon a certain day, to\r\nmarch in solemn procession, and persons deputed from the several cities\r\nof Gaul performed religious rites.  The senate likewise, among various\r\nother honours, decreed for him a triumphal arch of marble, with trophies,\r\nin the Appian Way, and gave the cognomen of Germanicus to him and his\r\nposterity.  In him the civil and military virtues were equally displayed;\r\nfor, besides his victories, he gained from the enemy the Spolia Opima\r\n[468], and frequently marked out the German chiefs in the midst of their\r\narmy, and encountered them in single combat, at the utmost hazard of his\r\nlife.  He likewise often declared that he would, some time or other, if\r\npossible, restore the ancient government.  In this account, I suppose,\r\nsome have ventured to affirm that Augustus was jealous of him, and\r\nrecalled him; and because he made no haste to comply with the order, took\r\nhim off by poison.  This I mention, that I may not be guilty of any\r\nomission, more than because I think it either true or probable; since\r\nAugustus loved him so much when living, that he always, in his wills,\r\nmade him joint-heir with his sons, as he once declared in the senate; and\r\nupon his decease, extolled him in a speech to the people, to that degree,\r\nthat he prayed the gods “to make his Caesars like him, and to grant\r\nhimself as honourable an exit out of this world as they had given him.”\r\n And not satisfied with inscribing upon his tomb an epitaph in verse\r\ncomposed by himself, he wrote likewise the history of his life in prose.\r\nHe had by the younger Antonia several children, but left behind him only\r\nthree, namely, Germanicus, Livilla, and Claudius.\r\n\r\nII.  Claudius was born at Lyons, in the consulship of Julius Antonius,\r\nand Fabius Africanus, upon the first of August [469], the very day upon\r\nwhich an altar was first dedicated there to Augustus.  He was named\r\nTiberius Claudius Drusus, but soon afterwards, (297) upon the adoption of\r\nhis elder brother into the Julian family, he assumed the cognomen of\r\nGermanicus.  He was left an infant by his father, and during almost the\r\nwhole of his minority, and for some time after he attained the age of\r\nmanhood, was afflicted with a variety of obstinate disorders, insomuch\r\nthat his mind and body being greatly impaired, he was, even after his\r\narrival at years of maturity, never thought sufficiently qualified for\r\nany public or private employment.  He was, therefore, during a long time,\r\nand even after the expiration of his minority, under the direction of a\r\npedagogue, who, he complains in a certain memoir, “was a barbarous\r\nwretch, and formerly superintendent of the mule-drivers, who was selected\r\nfor his governor, on purpose to correct him severely on every trifling\r\noccasion.”  On account of this crazy constitution of body and mind, at\r\nthe spectacle of gladiators, which he gave the people, jointly with his\r\nbrother, in honour of his father’s memory, he presided, muffled up in a\r\npallium--a new fashion.  When he assumed the manly habit, he was carried\r\nin a litter, at midnight, to the Capitol, without the usual ceremony.\r\n\r\nIII.  He applied himself, however, from an early age, with great\r\nassiduity to the study of the liberal sciences, and frequently published\r\nspecimens of his skill in each of them.  But never, with all his\r\nendeavours, could he attain to any public post in the government, or\r\nafford any hope of arriving at distinction thereafter.  His mother,\r\nAntonia, frequently called him “an abortion of a man, that had been only\r\nbegun, but never finished, by nature.”  And when she would upbraid any\r\none with dulness, she said, “He was a greater fool than her son,\r\nClaudius.”  His grandmother, Augusta, always treated him with the utmost\r\ncontempt, very rarely spoke to him, and when she did admonish him upon\r\nany occasion, it was in writing, very briefly and severely, or by\r\nmessengers.  His sister, Livilla, upon hearing that he was about to be\r\ncreated emperor, openly and loudly expressed her indignation that the\r\nRoman people should experience a fate so severe and so much below their\r\ngrandeur.  To exhibit the opinion, both favourable and otherwise,\r\nentertained concerning him by Augustus, his great-uncle, I have here\r\nsubjoined some extracts from the letters of that emperor.\r\n\r\nIV.  “I have had some conversation with Tiberius, according (298) to your\r\ndesire, my dear Livia, as to what must be done with your grandson,\r\nTiberius, at the games of Mars.  We are both agreed in this, that, once\r\nfor all, we ought to determine what course to take with him.  For if he\r\nbe really sound and, so to speak, quite right in his intellects [470],\r\nwhy should we hesitate to promote him by the same steps and degrees we\r\ndid his brother?  But if we find him below par, and deficient both in\r\nbody and mind, we must beware of giving occasion for him and ourselves to\r\nbe laughed at by the world, which is ready enough to make such things the\r\nsubject of mirth and derision.  For we never shall be easy, if we are\r\nalways to be debating upon every occasion of this kind, without settling,\r\nin the first instance, whether he be really capable of public offices or\r\nnot.  With regard to what you consult me about at the present moment, I\r\nam not against his superintending the feast of the priests, in the games\r\nof Mars, if he will suffer himself to be governed by his kinsman,\r\nSilanus’s son, that he may do nothing to make the people stare and laugh\r\nat him.  But I do not approve of his witnessing the Circensian games from\r\nthe Pulvinar.  He will be there exposed to view in the very front of the\r\ntheatre.  Nor do I like that he should go to the Alban Mount [471], or be\r\nat Rome during the Latin festivals.  For if he be capable of attending\r\nhis brother to the mount, why is he not made prefect of the city?  Thus,\r\nmy dear Livia, you have my thoughts upon the matter.  In my opinion, we\r\nought to (299) settle this affair once for all, that we may not be always\r\nin suspense between hope and fear.  You may, if you think proper, give\r\nyour kinsman Antonia this part of my letter to read.”  In another letter,\r\nhe writes as follows: “I shall invite: the youth, Tiberius, every day\r\nduring your absence, to supper, that he may not sup alone with his\r\nfriends Sulpicius and Athenodorus.  I wish the poor creature was more\r\ncautious and attentive in the choice of some one, whose manners, air, and\r\ngait might be proper for his imitation:\r\n\r\n    Atuchei panu en tois spoudaiois lian.\r\n    In things of consequence he sadly fails.\r\n\r\nWhere his mind does not run astray, he discovers a noble disposition.”\r\n In a third letter, he says, “Let me die, my dear Livia, if I am not\r\nastonished, that the declamation of your grandson, Tiberius, should\r\nplease me; for how he who talks so ill, should be able to declaim so\r\nclearly and properly, I cannot imagine.”  There is no doubt but Augustus,\r\nafter this, came to a resolution upon the subject, and, accordingly, left\r\nhim invested with no other honour than that of the Augural priesthood;\r\nnaming him amongst the heirs of the third degree, who were but distantly\r\nallied to his family, for a sixth part of his estate only, with a legacy\r\nof no more than eight hundred thousand sesterces.\r\n\r\nV.  Upon his requesting some office in the state, Tiberius granted him\r\nthe honorary appendages of the consulship, and when he pressed for a\r\nlegitimate appointment, the emperor wrote word back, that “he sent him\r\nforty gold pieces for his expenses, during the festivals of the\r\nSaturnalia and Sigillaria.”  Upon this, laying aside all hope of\r\nadvancement, he resigned himself entirely to an indolent life; living in\r\ngreat privacy, one while in his gardens, or a villa which he had near the\r\ncity; another while in Campania, where he passed his time in the lowest\r\nsociety; by which means, besides his former character of a dull, heavy\r\nfellow, he acquired that of a drunkard and gamester.\r\n\r\nVI.  Notwithstanding this sort of life, much respect was shown him both\r\nin public and private.  The equestrian (300) order twice made choice of\r\nhim to intercede on their behalf; once to obtain from the consuls the\r\nfavour of bearing on their shoulders the corpse of Augustus to Rome, and\r\na second time to congratulate him upon the death of Sejanus.  When he\r\nentered the theatre, they used to rise, and put off their cloaks.  The\r\nsenate likewise decreed, that he should be added to the number of the\r\nAugustal college of priests, who were chosen by lot; and soon afterwards,\r\nwhen his house was burnt down, that it should be rebuilt at the public\r\ncharge; and that he should have the privilege of giving his vote amongst\r\nthe men of consular rank.  This decree was, however, repealed; Tiberius\r\ninsisting to have him excused on account of his imbecility, and promising\r\nto make good his loss at his own expense.  But at his death, he named him\r\nin his will, amongst his third heirs, for a third part of his estate;\r\nleaving him besides a legacy of two millions of sesterces, and expressly\r\nrecommending him to the armies, the senate and people of Rome, amongst\r\nhis other relations.\r\n\r\nVII.  At last, Caius [473], his brother’s son, upon his advancement to\r\nthe empire, endeavouring to gain the affections of the public by all the\r\narts of popularity, Claudius also was admitted to public offices, and\r\nheld the consulship jointly with his nephew for two months.  As he was\r\nentering the Forum for the first time with the fasces, an eagle which was\r\nflying that way; alighted upon his right shoulder.  A second consulship\r\nwas also allotted him, to commence at the expiration of the fourth year.\r\nHe sometimes presided at the public spectacles, as the representative of\r\nCaius; being always, on those occasions, complimented with the\r\nacclamations of the people, wishing him all happiness, sometimes under\r\nthe title of the emperor’s uncle, and sometimes under that of\r\nGermanicus’s brother.\r\n\r\nVIII.  Still he was subjected to many slights.  If at any time he came in\r\nlate to supper, he was obliged to walk round the room some time before he\r\ncould get a place at table.  When he indulged himself with sleep after\r\neating, which was a common practice with him, the company used to throw\r\nolive-stones and dates at him.  And the buffoons who attended would wake\r\nhim, as if it were only in jest, with a cane or a whip.  Sometimes they\r\nwould put slippers upon his hands; as he lay snoring, that he might, upon\r\nawaking, rub his face with them.\r\n\r\nIX.  He was not only exposed to contempt, but sometimes likewise to\r\nconsiderable danger: first, in his consulship; for, having been too\r\nremiss in providing and erecting the statues of Caius’s brothers, Nero\r\nand Drusus, he was very near being deprived of his office; and afterwards\r\nhe was continually harassed with informations against him by one or\r\nother, sometimes even by his own domestics.  When the conspiracy of\r\nLepidus and Gaetulicus was discovered, being sent with some other\r\ndeputies into Germany [474], to congratulate the emperor upon the\r\noccasion, he was in danger of his life; Caius being greatly enraged, and\r\nloudly complaining, that his uncle was sent to him, as if he was a boy\r\nwho wanted a governor.  Some even say, that he was thrown into a river,\r\nin his travelling dress.  From this period, he voted in the senate always\r\nthe last of the members of consular rank; being called upon after the\r\nrest, on purpose to disgrace him.  A charge for the forgery of a will was\r\nalso allowed to be prosecuted, though he had only signed it as a witness.\r\nAt last, being obliged to pay eight millions of sesterces on entering\r\nupon a new office of priesthood, he was reduced to such straits in his\r\nprivate affairs, that in order to discharge his bond to the treasury, he\r\nwas under the necessity of exposing to sale his whole estate, by an order\r\nof the prefects.\r\n\r\nX.  Having spent the greater part of his life under these and the like\r\ncircumstances, he came at last to the empire in the fiftieth year of his\r\nage [475], by a very surprising turn of fortune.  Being, as well as the\r\nrest, prevented from approaching Caius by the conspirators, who dispersed\r\nthe crowd, under the pretext of his desiring to be private, he retired\r\ninto an apartment called the Hermaeum [476]; and soon afterwards,\r\nterrified by the report of Caius being slain, he crept into an adjoining\r\nbalcony, where he hid himself behind the hangings of (302) the door.  A\r\ncommon soldier, who happened to pass that way, spying his feet, and\r\ndesirous to discover who he was, pulled him out; when immediately\r\nrecognizing him, he threw himself in a great fright at his feet, and\r\nsaluted him by the title of emperor.  He then conducted him to his\r\nfellow-soldiers, who were all in a great rage, and irresolute what they\r\nshould do.  They put him into a litter, and as the slaves of the palace\r\nhad all fled, took their turns in carrying him on their shoulders, and\r\nbrought him into the camp, sad and trembling; the people who met him\r\nlamenting his situation, as if the poor innocent was being carried to\r\nexecution.  Being received within the ramparts [477], he continued all\r\nnight with the sentries on guard, recovered somewhat from his fright, but\r\nin no great hopes of the succession.  For the consuls, with the senate\r\nand civic troops, had possessed themselves of the Forum and Capitol, with\r\nthe determination to assert the public liberty; and he being sent for\r\nlikewise, by a tribune of the people, to the senate-house, to give his\r\nadvice upon the present juncture of affairs, returned answer, “I am under\r\nconstraint, and cannot possibly come.”  The day afterwards, the senate\r\nbeing dilatory in their proceedings, and worn out by divisions amongst\r\nthemselves, while the people who surrounded the senate-house shouted that\r\nthey would have one master, naming Claudius, he suffered the soldiers\r\nassembled under arms to swear allegiance to him, promising them fifteen\r\nthousand sesterces a man; he being the first of the Caesars who purchased\r\nthe submission of the soldiers with money. [478]\r\n\r\nXI.  Having thus established himself in power, his first object was to\r\nabolish all remembrance of the two preceding days, in which a revolution\r\nin the state had been canvassed.  Accordingly, he passed an act of\r\nperpetual oblivion and pardon for every thing said or done during that\r\ntime; and this he faithfully observed, with the exception only of putting\r\nto death a few tribunes and centurions concerned in the conspiracy\r\nagainst Caius, both as an example, and because he understood that they\r\nhad also planned his own death.  He now turned (303) his thoughts towards\r\npaying respect to the memory of his relations.  His most solemn and usual\r\noath was, “By Augustus.”  He prevailed upon the senate to decree divine\r\nhonours to his grandmother Livia, with a chariot in the Circensian\r\nprocession drawn by elephants, as had been appointed for Augustus [479];\r\nand public offerings to the shades of his parents.  Besides which, he\r\ninstituted Circensian games for his father, to be celebrated every year,\r\nupon his birth-day, and, for his mother, a chariot to be drawn through\r\nthe circus; with the title of Augusta, which had been refused by his\r\ngrandmother [480].  To the memory of his brother [481], to which, upon\r\nall occasions, he showed a great regard, he gave a Greek comedy, to be\r\nexhibited in the public diversions at Naples [482], and awarded the crown\r\nfor it, according to the sentence of the judges in that solemnity.  Nor\r\ndid he omit to make honourable and grateful mention of Mark Antony;\r\ndeclaring by a proclamation, “That he the more earnestly insisted upon\r\nthe observation of his father Drusus’s birth-day, because it was likewise\r\nthat of his grandfather Antony.”  He completed the marble arch near\r\nPompey’s theatre, which had formerly been decreed by the senate in honour\r\nof Tiberius, but which had been neglected [483].  And though he cancelled\r\nall the acts of Caius, yet he forbad the day of his assassination,\r\nnotwithstanding it was that of his own accession to the empire, to be\r\nreckoned amongst the festivals.\r\n\r\nXII.  But with regard to his own aggrandisement, he was sparing and\r\nmodest, declining the title of emperor, and refusing all excessive\r\nhonours.  He celebrated the marriage of his daughter and the birth-day of\r\na grandson with great privacy, at home.  He recalled none of those who\r\nhad been banished, without a decree of the senate: and requested of them\r\npermission for the prefect of the military tribunes and pretorian guards\r\nto attend him in the senate-house [484]; and (304) also that they would\r\nbe pleased to bestow upon his procurators judicial authority in the\r\nprovinces [485].  He asked of the consuls likewise the privilege of\r\nholding fairs upon his private estate.  He frequently assisted the\r\nmagistrates in the trial of causes, as one of their assessors.  And when\r\nthey gave public spectacles, he would rise up with the rest of the\r\nspectators, and salute them both by words and gestures.  When the\r\ntribunes of the people came to him while he was on the tribunal, he\r\nexcused himself, because, on account of the crowd, he could not hear them\r\nunless they stood.  In a short time, by this conduct, he wrought himself\r\nso much into the favour and affection of the public, that when, upon his\r\ngoing to Ostia, a report was spread in the city that he had been way-laid\r\nand slain, the people never ceased cursing the soldiers for traitors, and\r\nthe senate as parricides, until one or two persons, and presently after\r\nseveral others, were brought by the magistrates upon the rostra, who\r\nassured them that he was alive, and not far from the city, on his way\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nXIII.  Conspiracies, however, were formed against him, not only by\r\nindividuals separately, but by a faction; and at last his government was\r\ndisturbed with a civil war.  A low fellow was found with a poniard about\r\nhim, near his chamber, at midnight.  Two men of the equestrian order were\r\ndiscovered waiting for him in the streets, armed with a tuck and a\r\nhuntsman’s dagger; one of them intending to attack him as he came out of\r\nthe theatre, and the other as he was sacrificing in the temple of Mars.\r\nGallus Asinius and Statilius Corvinus, grandsons of the two orators,\r\nPollio and Messala [486], formed a conspiracy against him, in which they\r\nengaged many of his freedmen and slaves.  Furius Camillus Scribonianus,\r\nhis lieutenant in Dalmatia, broke into rebellion, but was reduced in\r\n(305) the space of five days; the legions which he had seduced from their\r\noath of fidelity relinquishing their purpose, upon an alarm occasioned by\r\nill omens.  For when orders were given them to march, to meet their new\r\nemperor, the eagles could not be decorated, nor the standards pulled out\r\nof the ground, whether it was by accident, or a divine interposition.\r\n\r\nXIV.  Besides his former consulship, he held the office afterwards four\r\ntimes; the first two successively [487], but the following, after an\r\ninterval of four years each [488]; the last for six months, the others\r\nfor two; and the third, upon his being chosen in the room of a consul who\r\ndied; which had never been done by any of the emperors before him.\r\nWhether he was consul or out of office, he constantly attended the courts\r\nfor the administration of justice, even upon such days as were solemnly\r\nobserved as days of rejoicing in his family, or by his friends; and\r\nsometimes upon the public festivals of ancient institution.  Nor did he\r\nalways adhere strictly to the letter of the laws, but overruled the\r\nrigour or lenity of many of their enactments, according to his sentiments\r\nof justice and equity.  For where persons lost their suits by insisting\r\nupon more than appeared to be their due, before the judges of private\r\ncauses, he granted them the indulgence of a second trial.  And with\r\nregard to such as were convicted of any great delinquency, he even\r\nexceeded the punishment appointed by law, and condemned them to be\r\nexposed to wild beasts. [489]\r\n\r\nXV.  But in hearing and determining causes, he exhibited a strange\r\ninconsistency of temper, being at one time circumspect and sagacious, at\r\nanother inconsiderate and rash, and sometimes frivolous, and like one out\r\nof his mind.  In correcting the roll of judges, he struck off the name of\r\none who, concealing the privilege his children gave him to be excused\r\nfrom serving, had answered to his name, as too eager for the office.\r\nAnother who was summoned before him in a cause of his own, but alleged\r\nthat the affair did not properly come under the (306) emperor’s\r\ncognizance, but that of the ordinary judges, he ordered to plead the\r\ncause himself immediately before him, and show in a case of his own, how\r\nequitable a judge he would prove in that of other persons.  A woman\r\nrefusing to acknowledge her own son, and there being no clear proof on\r\neither side, he obliged her to confess the truth, by ordering her to\r\nmarry the young man [490].  He was much inclined to determine causes in\r\nfavour of the parties who appeared, against those who did not, without\r\ninquiring whether their absence was occasioned by their own fault, or by\r\nreal necessity.  On proclamation of a man’s being convicted of forgery,\r\nand that he ought to have his hand cut off, he insisted that an\r\nexecutioner should be immediately sent for, with a Spanish sword and a\r\nblock.  A person being prosecuted for falsely assuming the freedom of\r\nRome, and a frivolous dispute arising between the advocates in the cause,\r\nwhether he ought to make his appearance in the Roman or Grecian dress, to\r\nshow his impartiality, he commanded him to change his clothes several\r\ntimes according to the character he assumed in the accusation or defence.\r\nAn anecdote is related of him, and believed to be true, that, in a\r\nparticular cause, he delivered his sentence in writing thus: “I am in\r\nfavour of those who have spoken the truth.” [491]  By this he so much\r\nforfeited the good opinion of the world, that he was everywhere and\r\nopenly despised.  A person making an excuse for the non-appearance of a\r\nwitness whom he had sent for from the provinces, declared it was\r\nimpossible for him to appear, concealing the reason for some time: at\r\nlast, after several interrogatories were put to him on the subject, he\r\nanswered, “The man is dead;” to which Claudius replied, “I think that is\r\na sufficient excuse.”  Another thanking him for suffering a person who\r\nwas prosecuted to make his defence by counsel, added, “And yet it is no\r\nmore than what is usual.”  I have likewise heard some old men say [492],\r\nthat the advocates used to abuse his patience so grossly, that they would\r\nnot only (307) call him back, as he was quitting the tribunal, but would\r\nseize him by the lap of his coat, and sometimes catch him by the heels,\r\nto make him stay.  That such behaviour, however strange, is not\r\nincredible, will appear from this anecdote.  Some obscure Greek, who was\r\na litigant, had an altercation with him, in which he called out, “You are\r\nan old fool.” [493]  It is certain that a Roman knight, who was\r\nprosecuted by an impotent device of his enemies on a false charge of\r\nabominable obscenity with women, observing that common strumpets were\r\nsummoned against him and allowed to give evidence, upbraided Claudius in\r\nvery harsh and severe terms with his folly and cruelty, and threw his\r\nstyle, and some books which he had in his hands, in his face, with such\r\nviolence as to wound him severely in the cheek.\r\n\r\nXVI.  He likewise assumed the censorship [494], which had been\r\ndiscontinued since the time that Paulus and Plancus had jointly held it.\r\nBut this also he administered very unequally, and with a strange variety\r\nof humour and conduct.  In his review of the knights, he passed over,\r\nwithout any mark of disgrace, a profligate young man, only because his\r\nfather spoke of him in the highest terms; “for,” said he, “his father is\r\nhis proper censor.”  Another, who was infamous for debauching youths and\r\nfor adultery, he only admonished “to indulge his youthful inclinations\r\nmore sparingly, or at least more cautiously;” [495] adding, “why must I\r\nknow what mistress you keep?”  When, at the request of his friends, he\r\nhad taken off a mark of infamy which he had set upon one knight’s name,\r\nhe said, “Let the blot, however, remain.”  He not only struck out of the\r\nlist of judges, but likewise deprived of the freedom of Rome, an\r\nillustrious man of the highest provincial rank in Greece, only because he\r\nwas ignorant of the Latin language.  Nor in this review did he suffer any\r\none to give an account of his conduct by an advocate, but obliged each\r\nman to speak for himself in the best way he could.  He disgraced many,\r\nand some that little expected it, and for a reason entirely new, namely,\r\nfor going out of Italy without his license; (308) and one likewise, for\r\nhaving in his province been the familiar companion of a king; observing,\r\nthat, in former times, Rabirius Posthumus had been prosecuted for\r\ntreason, although he only went after Ptolemy to Alexandria for the\r\npurpose of securing payment of a debt [496].  Having tried to brand with\r\ndisgrace several others, he, to his own greater shame, found them\r\ngenerally innocent, through the negligence of the persons employed to\r\ninquire into their characters; those whom he charged with living in\r\ncelibacy, with want of children, or estate, proving themselves to be\r\nhusbands, parents, and in affluent circumstances.  One of the knights who\r\nwas charged with stabbing himself, laid his bosom bare, to show that\r\nthere was not the least mark of violence upon his body.  The following\r\nincidents were remarkable in his censorship.  He ordered a car, plated\r\nwith silver, and of very sumptuous workmanship, which was exposed for\r\nsale in the Sigillaria [497], to be purchased, and broken in pieces\r\nbefore his eyes.  He published twenty proclamations in one day, in one of\r\nwhich he advised the people, “Since the vintage was very plentiful, to\r\nhave their casks well secured at the bung with pitch:” and in another, he\r\ntold them, “that nothing would sooner cure the bite of a viper, than the\r\nsap of the yew-tree.”\r\n\r\nXVII.  He undertook only one expedition, and that was of short duration.\r\nThe triumphal ornaments decreed him by the senate, he considered as\r\nbeneath the imperial dignity, and was therefore resolved to have the\r\nhonour of a real triumph.  For this purpose, he selected Britain, which\r\nhad never been attempted by any one since Julius Caesar [498], and was\r\nthen chafing (309) with rage, because the Romans would not give up some\r\ndeserters.  Accordingly, he set sail from Ostia, but was twice very near\r\nbeing wrecked by the boisterous wind called Circius [499], upon the coast\r\nof Liguria, and near the islands called Stoechades [500].  Having marched\r\nby land from Marseilles to Gessoriacum [501], he thence passed over to\r\nBritain, and part of the island submitting to him, within a few days\r\nafter his arrival, without battle or bloodshed, he returned to Rome in\r\nless than six months from the time of his departure, and triumphed in the\r\nmost solemn manner [502]; to witness which, he not only (310) gave leave\r\nto governors of provinces to come to Rome, but even to some of the\r\nexiles.  Among the spoils taken from the enemy, he fixed upon the\r\npediment of his house in the Palatium, a naval crown, in token of his\r\nhaving passed, and, as it were, conquered the Ocean, and had it suspended\r\nnear the civic crown which was there before.  Messalina, his wife,\r\nfollowed his chariot in a covered litter [503].  Those who had attained\r\nthe honour of triumphal ornaments in the same war, rode behind; the rest\r\nfollowed on foot, wearing the robe with the broad stripes.  Crassus Frugi\r\nwas mounted upon a horse richly caparisoned, in a robe embroidered with\r\npalm leaves, because this was the second time of his obtaining that\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nXVIII.  He paid particular attention to the care of the city, and to have\r\nit well supplied with provisions.  A dreadful fire happening in the\r\nAemiliana [504], which lasted some time, he passed two nights in the\r\nDiribitorium [505], and the soldiers and gladiators not being in\r\nsufficient numbers to extinguish it, he caused the magistrates to summon\r\nthe people out of all the streets in the city, to their assistance.\r\nPlacing bags of money before him, he encouraged them to do their utmost,\r\ndeclaring, that he would reward every one on the spot, according to their\r\nexertions.\r\n\r\nXIX.  During a scarcity of provisions, occasioned by bad crops for\r\nseveral successive years, he was stopped in the middle of the Forum by\r\nthe mob, who so abused him, at the same time pelting him with fragments\r\nof bread, that he had some (311) difficulty in escaping into the palace\r\nby a back door.  He therefore used all possible means to bring provisions\r\nto the city, even in the winter.  He proposed to the merchants a sure\r\nprofit, by indemnifying them against any loss that might befall them by\r\nstorms at sea; and granted great privileges to those who built ships for\r\nthat traffic.  To a citizen of Rome he gave an exemption from the penalty\r\nof the Papia-Poppaean law [506]; to one who had only the privilege of\r\nLatium, the freedom of the city; and to women the rights which by law\r\nbelonged to those who had four children: which enactments are in force to\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\nXX.  He completed some important public works, which, though not\r\nnumerous, were very useful.  The principal were an aqueduct, which had\r\nbeen begun by Caius; an emissary for the discharge of the waters of the\r\nFucine lake [507], and the harbour of Ostia; although he knew that\r\nAugustus had refused to comply with the repeated application of the\r\nMarsians for one of these; and that the other had been several times\r\nintended by Julius Caesar, but as often abandoned on account of the\r\ndifficulty of its execution.  He brought to the city the cool and\r\nplentiful springs of the Claudian water, one of which is called\r\nCaeruleus, and the other Curtius and Albudinus, as likewise the river of\r\nthe New Anio, in a stone canal; and distributed them into many\r\nmagnificent reservoirs.  The canal from the Fucine lake was undertaken as\r\nmuch for the sake of profit, as for the honour of the enterprise; for\r\nthere were parties who offered to drain it at their own expense, on\r\ncondition of their having a grant of the land laid dry.  With great\r\ndifficulty he completed a canal three miles in length, partly by cutting\r\nthrough, and partly by tunnelling, a mountain; thirty thousand men being\r\nconstantly employed in the work for eleven years [508].  He formed the\r\nharbour at Ostia, by carrying out circular piers on the right and on the\r\nleft, with (312) a mole protecting, in deep water, the entrance of the\r\nport [509].  To secure the foundation of this mole, he sunk the vessel in\r\nwhich the great obelisk [510] had been brought from Egypt [511]; and\r\nbuilt upon piles a very lofty tower, in imitation of the Pharos at\r\nAlexandria, on which lights were burnt to direct mariners in the night.\r\n\r\nXXI.  He often distributed largesses of corn and money among the people,\r\nand entertained them with a great variety of public magnificent\r\nspectacles, not only such as were usual, and in the accustomed places,\r\nbut some of new invention, and others revived from ancient models, and\r\nexhibited in places where nothing of the kind had been ever before\r\nattempted.  In the games which he presented at the dedication of Pompey’s\r\ntheatre [512], which had been burnt down, and was rebuilt by him, he\r\npresided upon a tribunal erected for him in the orchestra; having first\r\npaid his devotions, in the temple above, and then coming down through the\r\ncentre of the circle, while all the people kept their seats in profound\r\nsilence [513].  He likewise (313) exhibited the secular games [514],\r\ngiving out that Augustus had anticipated the regular period; though he\r\nhimself says in his history, “That they had been omitted before the age\r\nof Augustus, who had calculated the years with great exactness, and again\r\nbrought them to their regular period.” [515]  The crier was therefore\r\nridiculed, when he invited people in the usual form, “to games which no\r\nperson had ever before seen, nor ever would again;” when many were still\r\nliving who had already seen them; and some of the performers who had\r\nformerly acted in them, were now again brought upon the stage.  He\r\nlikewise frequently celebrated the Circensian games in the Vatican [516],\r\nsometimes exhibiting a hunt of wild beasts, after every five courses.  He\r\nembellished the Circus Maximus with marble barriers, and gilded goals,\r\nwhich before were of common stone [517] and wood, and assigned proper\r\nplaces for the senators, who were used to sit promiscuously with the\r\nother spectators.  Besides the chariot-races, he exhibited there the\r\nTrojan game, and wild beasts from Africa, which were encountered by a\r\ntroop of pretorian knights, with their tribunes, and even the prefect at\r\nthe head of them; besides Thessalian horse, who drive fierce bulls round\r\nthe circus, leap upon their backs when they have exhausted their fury,\r\nand drag them by the horns to the ground.  He gave exhibitions of\r\ngladiators in several places, and of various kinds; one yearly on the\r\nanniversary of his accession in the pretorian camp [518], but without any\r\nhunting, or the usual apparatus; another in the Septa as usual; and in\r\nthe same place, another out of the common way, and of a few days’\r\ncontinuance only, which he called Sportula; because when he was going to\r\npresent it, he informed the people by proclamation, “that he invited them\r\nto a late supper, got up in haste, and without ceremony.”  Nor did he\r\nlend himself to any kind of public diversion with more freedom and\r\nhilarity; insomuch that he would hold out his left hand, and (314) joined\r\nby the common people, count upon his fingers aloud the gold pieces\r\npresented to those who came off conquerors.  He would earnestly invite\r\nthe company to be merry; sometimes calling them his “masters,” with a\r\nmixture of insipid, far-fetched jests.  Thus, when the people called for\r\nPalumbus [519], he said, “He would give them one when he could catch it.”\r\n The following was well-intended, and well-timed; having, amidst great\r\napplause, spared a gladiator, on the intercession of his four sons, he\r\nsent a billet immediately round the theatre, to remind the people, “how\r\nmuch it behoved them to get children, since they had before them an\r\nexample how useful they had been in procuring favour and security for a\r\ngladiator.”  He likewise represented in the Campus Martius, the assault\r\nand sacking of a town, and the surrender of the British kings [520],\r\npresiding in his general’s cloak.  Immediately before he drew off the\r\nwaters from the Fucine lake, he exhibited upon it a naval fight.  But the\r\ncombatants on board the fleets crying out, “Health attend you, noble\r\nemperor!  We, who are about to peril our lives, salute you;” and he\r\nreplying, “Health attend you too,” they all refused to fight, as if by\r\nthat response he had meant to excuse them.  Upon this, he hesitated for a\r\ntime, whether he should not destroy them all with fire and sword.  At\r\nlast, leaping from his seat, and running along the shore of the lake with\r\ntottering steps, the result of his foul excesses, he, partly by fair\r\nwords, and partly by threats, persuaded them to engage.  This spectacle\r\nrepresented an engagement between the fleets of Sicily and Rhodes;\r\nconsisting each of twelve ships of war, of three banks of oars.  The\r\nsignal for the encounter was given by a silver Triton, raised by\r\nmachinery from the middle of the lake.\r\n\r\nXXII.  With regard to religious ceremonies, the administration of affairs\r\nboth civil and military, and the condition of all orders of the people at\r\nhome and abroad, some practices he corrected, others which had been laid\r\naside he revived; and some regulations he introduced which were entirely\r\nnew.  In appointing new priests for the several colleges, he made no\r\nappointments without being sworn.  When an earthquake (315) happened in\r\nthe city, he never failed to summon the people together by the praetor,\r\nand appoint holidays for sacred rites.  And upon the sight of any ominous\r\nbird in the City or Capitol, he issued an order for a supplication, the\r\nwords of which, by virtue of his office of high priest, after an\r\nexhortation from the rostra, he recited in the presence of the people,\r\nwho repeated them after him; all workmen and slaves being first ordered\r\nto withdraw.\r\n\r\nXXIII.  The courts of judicature, whose sittings had been formerly\r\ndivided between the summer and winter months, he ordered, for the\r\ndispatch of business, to sit the whole year round.  The jurisdiction in\r\nmatters of trust, which used to be granted annually by special commission\r\nto certain magistrates, and in the city only, he made permanent, and\r\nextended to the provincial judges likewise.  He altered a clause added by\r\nTiberius to the Papia-Poppaean law [521], which inferred that men of\r\nsixty years of age were incapable of begetting children.  He ordered\r\nthat, out of the ordinary course of proceeding, orphans might have\r\nguardians appointed them by the consuls; and that those who were banished\r\nfrom any province by the chief magistrate, should be debarred from coming\r\ninto the City, or any part of Italy.  He inflicted on certain persons a\r\nnew sort of banishment, by forbidding them to depart further than three\r\nmiles from Rome.  When any affair of importance came before the senate,\r\nhe used to sit between the two consuls upon the seats of the tribunes.\r\nHe reserved to himself the power of granting license to travel out of\r\nItaly, which before had belonged to the senate.\r\n\r\nXXIV.  He likewise granted the consular ornaments to his Ducenarian\r\nprocurators.  From those who declined the senatorian dignity, he took\r\naway the equestrian.  Although he had in the beginning of his reign\r\ndeclared, that he would admit no man into the senate who was not the\r\ngreat-grandson of a Roman citizen, yet he gave the “broad hem” to the son\r\nof a freedman, on condition that he should be adopted by a Roman knight.\r\nBeing afraid, however, of incurring censure by such an act, he informed\r\nthe public, that his ancestor Appius Caecus, the censor, had elected the\r\nsons of freedmen into (316) the senate; for he was ignorant, it seems,\r\nthat in the times of Appius, and a long while afterwards, persons\r\nmanumitted were not called freedmen, but only their sons who were\r\nfree-born.  Instead of the expense which the college of quaestors was\r\nobliged to incur in paving the high-ways, he ordered them to give the\r\npeople an exhibition of gladiators; and relieving them of the provinces of\r\nOstia and [Cisalpine] Gaul, he reinstated them in the charge of the\r\ntreasury, which, since it was taken from them, had been managed by the\r\npraetors, or those who had formerly filled that office.  He gave the\r\ntriumphal ornaments to Silanus, who was betrothed to his daughter, though\r\nhe was under age; and in other cases, he bestowed them on so many, and\r\nwith so little reserve, that there is extant a letter unanimously\r\naddressed to him by all the legions, begging him “to grant his consular\r\nlieutenants the triumphal ornaments at the time of their appointment to\r\ncommands, in order to prevent their seeking occasion to engage in\r\nunnecessary wars.” He decreed to Aulus Plautius the honour of an ovation\r\n[522], going to meet him at his entering the city, and walking with him in\r\nthe procession to the Capitol, and back, in which he took the left side,\r\ngiving him the post of honour.  He allowed Gabinius Secundus, upon his\r\nconquest of the Chauci, a German tribe, to assume the cognomen of\r\nChaucius. [523]\r\n\r\nXXV.  His military organization of the equestrian order was this.  After\r\nhaving the command of a cohort, they were promoted to a wing of auxiliary\r\nhorse, and subsequently received the commission of tribune of a legion.\r\nHe raised a body of militia, who were called Supernumeraries, who, though\r\nthey were a sort of soldiers, and kept in reserve, yet received pay.  He\r\nprocured an act of the senate to prohibit all soldiers from attending\r\nsenators at their houses, in the way of respect and compliment.  He\r\nconfiscated the estates of all freedmen who presumed to take upon\r\nthemselves the equestrian rank.  Such of them as were ungrateful to their\r\npatrons, and were complained of by them, he reduced to their former\r\ncondition of (317) slavery; and declared to their advocates, that he\r\nwould always give judgment against the freedmen, in any suit at law which\r\nthe masters might happen to have with them.  Some persons having exposed\r\ntheir sick slaves, in a languishing condition, on the island of\r\nAesculapius [524], because of the tediousness of their cure; he declared\r\nall who were so exposed perfectly free, never more to return, if they\r\nshould recover, to their former servitude; and that if any one chose to\r\nkill at once, rather than expose, a slave, he should be liable for\r\nmurder.  He published a proclamation, forbidding all travellers to pass\r\nthrough the towns of Italy any otherwise than on foot, or in a litter or\r\nchair [525].  He quartered a cohort of soldiers at Puteoli, and another\r\nat Ostia, to be in readiness against any accidents from fire.  He\r\nprohibited foreigners from adopting Roman names, especially those which\r\nbelonged to families [526].  Those who falsely pretended to the freedom\r\nof Rome, he beheaded on the Esquiline.  He gave up to the senate the\r\nprovinces of Achaia and Macedonia, which Tiberius had transferred to his\r\nown administration.  He deprived the Lycians of their liberties, as a\r\npunishment for their fatal dissensions; but restored to the Rhodians\r\ntheir freedom, upon their repenting of their former misdemeanors.  He\r\nexonerated for ever the people of Ilium from the payment of taxes, as\r\nbeing the founders of the Roman race; reciting upon the occasion a letter\r\nin Greek, (318) from the senate and people of Rome to king Seleucus\r\n[527], on which they promised him their friendship and alliance, provided\r\nthat he would grant their kinsmen the Iliensians immunity from all\r\nburdens.\r\n\r\nHe banished from Rome all the Jews, who were continually making\r\ndisturbances at the instigation of one Chrestus [528].  He allowed the\r\nambassadors of the Germans to sit at the public spectacles in the seats\r\nassigned to the senators, being induced to grant them favours by their\r\nfrank and honourable conduct.  For, having been seated in the rows of\r\nbenches which were common to the people, on observing the Parthian and\r\nArmenian ambassadors sitting among the senators, they took upon\r\nthemselves to cross over into the same seats, as being, they said, no way\r\ninferior to the others, in point either, of merit or rank.  The religious\r\nrites of the Druids, solemnized with such horrid cruelties, which had\r\nonly been forbidden the citizens of Rome during the reign of Augustus, he\r\nutterly abolished among the Gauls [529].  On the other hand, he attempted\r\n(319) to transfer the Eleusinian mysteries from Attica to Rome [530].  He\r\nlikewise ordered the temple of Venus Erycina in Sicily, which was old and\r\nin a ruinous condition, to be repaired at the expense of the Roman\r\npeople.  He concluded treaties with foreign princes in the forum, with\r\nthe sacrifice of a sow, and the form of words used by the heralds in\r\nformer times.  But in these and other things, and indeed the greater part\r\nof his administration, he was directed not so much by his own judgment,\r\nas by the influence of his wives and freedmen; for the most part acting\r\nin conformity to what their interests or fancies dictated.\r\n\r\nXXVI.  He was twice married at a very early age, first to Aemilia Lepida,\r\nthe grand-daughter of Augustus, and afterwards to Livia Medullina, who\r\nhad the cognomen of Camilla, and was descended from the old dictator\r\nCamillus.  The former he divorced while still a virgin, because her\r\nparents had incurred the displeasure of Augustus; and he lost the latter\r\nby sickness on the day fixed for their nuptials.  He next married Plautia\r\nUrgulanilla, whose father had enjoyed the honour of a triumph; and soon\r\nafterwards, Aelia Paetina, the daughter of a man of consular rank.  But\r\nhe divorced them both; Paetina, upon some trifling causes of disgust; and\r\nUrgulanilla, for scandalous lewdness, and the suspicion of murder.  After\r\nthem he took in marriage Valeria Messalina, the daughter of Barbatus\r\nMessala, his cousin.  But finding that, besides her other shameful\r\ndebaucheries, she had even gone so far as to marry in his own absence\r\nCaius Silius, the settlement of her dower being formally signed, in the\r\npresence of the augurs, he put her to death.  When summoning his\r\npretorians to his presence, he made to them this declaration: “As I have\r\nbeen so unhappy in my unions, I am resolved to continue in future\r\nunmarried; and if I should not, I give you leave to stab me.”  He was,\r\nhowever, unable to persist in this resolution; for he began immediately\r\nto think of another wife; and even of taking back Paetina, whom he had\r\nformerly divorced: he thought also of Lollia Paulina, who had been\r\nmarried to Caius Caesar.  But being ensnared by the arts of Agrippina,\r\n(320) the daughter of his brother Germanicus, who took advantage of the\r\nkisses and endearments which their near relationship admitted, to inflame\r\nhis desires, he got some one to propose at the next meeting of the\r\nsenate, that they should oblige the emperor to marry Agrippina, as a\r\nmeasure highly conducive to the public interest; and that in future\r\nliberty should be given for such marriages, which until that time had\r\nbeen considered incestuous.  In less than twenty-four hours after this,\r\nhe married her [531].  No person was found, however, to follow the\r\nexample, excepting one freedman, and a centurion of the first rank, at\r\nthe solemnization of whose nuptials both he and Agrippina attended.\r\n\r\nXXVII.  He had children by three of his wives: by Urgulanilla, Drusus and\r\nClaudia; by Paetina, Antonia; and by Messalina, Octavia, and also a son,\r\nwhom at first he called Germanicus, but afterwards Britannicus.  He lost\r\nDrusus at Pompeii, when he was very young; he being choked with a pear,\r\nwhich in his play he tossed into the air, and caught in his mouth.  Only\r\na few days before, he had betrothed him to one of Sejanus’s daughters\r\n[532]; and I am therefore surprised that some authors should say he lost\r\nhis life by the treachery of Sejanus.  Claudia, who was, in truth, the\r\ndaughter of Boter his freedman, though she was born five months before\r\nhis divorce, he ordered to be thrown naked at her mother’s door.  He\r\nmarried Antonia to Cneius Pompey the Great [533], and afterwards to\r\nFaustus Sylla [534], both youths of very noble parentage; Octavia to his\r\nstep-son Nero [535], after she had been contracted to Silanus.\r\nBritannicus was born upon the twentieth day of his reign, and in his\r\nsecond consulship.  He often earnestly commended him to the soldiers,\r\nholding him in his arms before their ranks; and would likewise show him\r\nto the people in the theatre, setting him upon his lap, or holding him\r\nout whilst he was still very young; and was sure to receive their\r\nacclamations, and good wishes on his behalf.  Of his (321) sons-in-law,\r\nhe adopted Nero.  He not only dismissed from his favour both Pompey and\r\nSilanus, but put them to death.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.  Amongst his freedmen, the greatest favourite was the eunuch\r\nPosides, whom, in his British triumph, he presented with the pointless\r\nspear, classing him among the military men.  Next to him, if not equal,\r\nin favour was Felix [536], whom he not only preferred to commands both of\r\ncohorts and troops, but to the government of the province of Judaea; and\r\nhe became, in consequence of his elevation, the husband of three queens\r\n[537].  Another favourite was Harpocras, to whom he granted the privilege\r\nof being carried in a litter within the city, and of holding public\r\nspectacles for the entertainment of the people.  In this class was\r\nlikewise Polybius, who assisted him in his studies, and had often the\r\nhonour of walking between the two consuls.  But above all others,\r\nNarcissus, his secretary, and Pallas [538], the comptroller of his\r\naccounts, were in high favour with him.  He not only allowed them to\r\nreceive, by decree of the senate, immense presents, but also to be\r\ndecorated with the quaestorian and praetorian ensigns of honour.  So much\r\ndid he indulge them in amassing wealth, and plundering the public, that,\r\nupon his complaining, once, of the lowness of his exchequer, some one\r\nsaid, with great reason, that “It would be full enough, if those two\r\nfreedmen of his would but take him into partnership with them.”\r\n\r\nXXIX.  Being entirely governed by these freedmen, and, as I have already\r\nsaid, by his wives, he was a tool to others, rather than a prince.  He\r\ndistributed offices, or the command of armies, pardoned or punished,\r\naccording as it suited their interests, (322) their passions, or their\r\ncaprice; and for the most part, without knowing, or being sensible of\r\nwhat he did.  Not to enter into minute details relative to the revocation\r\nof grants, the reversal of judicial decisions, obtaining his signature to\r\nfictitious appointments, or the bare-faced alteration of them after\r\nsigning; he put to death Appius Silanus, the father of his son-in-law,\r\nand the two Julias, the daughters of Drusus and Germanicus, without any\r\npositive proof of the crimes with which they were charged, or so much as\r\npermitting them to make any defence.  He also cut off Cneius Pompey, the\r\nhusband of his eldest daughter; and Lucius Silanus, who was betrothed to\r\nthe younger Pompey, was stabbed in the act of unnatural lewdness with a\r\nfavourite paramour.  Silanus was obliged to quit the office of praetor\r\nupon the fourth of the calends of January [29th Dec.], and to kill\r\nhimself on new year’s day [539] following, the very same on which\r\nClaudius and Agrippina were married.  He condemned to death five and\r\nthirty senators, and above three hundred Roman knights, with so little\r\nattention to what he did, that when a centurion brought him word of the\r\nexecution of a man of consular rank, who was one of the number, and told\r\nhim that he had executed his order, he declared, “he had ordered no such\r\nthing, but that he approved of it;” because his freedmen, it seems, had\r\nsaid, that the soldiers did nothing more than their duty, in dispatching\r\nthe emperor’s enemies without waiting for a warrant.  But it is beyond\r\nall belief, that he himself, at the marriage of Messalina with the\r\nadulterous Silius, should actually sign the writings relative to her\r\ndowry; induced, as it is pretended, by the design of diverting from\r\nhimself and transferring upon another the danger which some omens seemed\r\nto threaten him.\r\n\r\nXXX.  Either standing or sitting, but especially when he lay asleep, he\r\nhad a majestic and graceful appearance; for he was tall, but not slender.\r\nHis grey looks became him well, and he had a full neck.  But his knees\r\nwere feeble, and failed him in walking, so that his gait was ungainly,\r\nboth when he assumed state, and when he was taking diversion.  He was\r\noutrageous in his laughter, and still more so in his wrath, for then he\r\nfoamed at the mouth, and discharged from his nostrils.  He also stammered\r\nin his speech, and had a tremulous motion (323) of the head at all times,\r\nbut particularly when he was engaged in any business, however trifling.\r\n\r\nXXXI.  Though his health was very infirm during the former part of his\r\nlife, yet, after he became emperor, he enjoyed a good state of health,\r\nexcept only that he was subject to a pain of the stomach.  In a fit of\r\nthis complaint, he said he had thoughts of killing himself.\r\n\r\nXXXII.  He gave entertainments as frequent as they were splendid, and\r\ngenerally when there was such ample room, that very often six hundred\r\nguests sat down together.  At a feast he gave on the banks of the canal\r\nfor draining the Fucine Lake, he narrowly escaped being drowned, the\r\nwater at its discharge rushing out with such violence, that it overflowed\r\nthe conduit.  At supper he had always his own children, with those of\r\nseveral of the nobility, who, according to an ancient custom, sat at the\r\nfeet of the couches.  One of his guests having been suspected of\r\npurloining a golden cup, he invited him again the next day, but served\r\nhim with a porcelain jug.  It is said, too, that he intended to publish\r\nan edict, “allowing to all people the liberty of giving vent at table to\r\nany distension occasioned by flatulence,” upon hearing of a person whose\r\nmodesty, when under restraint, had nearly cost him his life.\r\n\r\nXXXIII.  He was always ready to eat and drink at any time or in any\r\nplace.  One day, as he was hearing causes in the Forum of Augustus, he\r\nsmelt the dinner which was preparing for the Salii [540], in the temple\r\nof Mars adjoining, whereupon he quitted (324) the tribunal, and went to\r\npartake of the feast with the priests.\r\n\r\nHe scarcely ever left the table until he had thoroughly crammed himself\r\nand drank to intoxication; and then he would immediately fall asleep,\r\nlying upon his back with his mouth open.  While in this condition, a\r\nfeather was put down his throat, to make him throw up the contents of his\r\nstomach.  Upon composing himself to rest, his sleep was short, and he\r\nusually awoke before midnight; but he would sometimes sleep in the\r\ndaytime, and that, even, when he was upon the tribunal; so that the\r\nadvocates often found it difficult to wake him, though they raised their\r\nvoices for that purpose.  He set no bounds to his libidinous intercourse\r\nwith women, but never betrayed any unnatural desires for the other sex.\r\nHe was fond of gaming, and published a book upon the subject.  He even\r\nused to play as he rode in his chariot, having the tables so fitted, that\r\nthe game was not disturbed by the motion of the carriage.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.  His cruel and sanguinary disposition was exhibited upon great as\r\nwell as trifling occasions.  When any person was to be put to the\r\ntorture, or criminal punished for parricide, he was impatient for the\r\nexecution, and would have it performed in his own presence.  When he was\r\nat Tibur, being desirous of seeing an example of the old way of putting\r\nmalefactors to death, some were immediately bound to a stake for the\r\npurpose; but there being no executioner to be had at the place, he sent\r\nfor one from Rome, and waited for his coming until night.  In any\r\nexhibition of gladiators, presented either by himself or others, if any\r\nof the combatants chanced to fall, he ordered them to be butchered,\r\nespecially the Retiarii, that he might see their faces in the agonies of\r\ndeath.  Two gladiators happening to kill each other, he immediately\r\nordered some little knives to be made of their swords for his own use.\r\nHe took great pleasure in seeing men engage with wild beasts, and the\r\ncombatants who appeared on the stage at noon.  He would therefore come to\r\nthe theatre by break of day, and at noon, dismissing the people to\r\ndinner, continued sitting himself; and besides those who were devoted to\r\nthat sanguinary fate, he would match others with the beasts, upon slight\r\nor sudden occasions; as, for instance, the carpenters and their (326)\r\nassistants, and people of that sort, if a machine, or any piece of work\r\nin which they had been employed about the theatre did not answer the\r\npurpose for which it had been intended.  To this desperate kind of\r\nencounter he forced one of his nomenclators, even encumbered as he was by\r\nwearing the toga.\r\n\r\nXXXV.  But the characteristics most predominant in him were fear and\r\ndistrust.  In the beginning of his reign, though he much affected a\r\nmodest and humble appearance, as has been already observed, yet he durst\r\nnot venture himself at an entertainment without being attended by a guard\r\nof spearmen, and made soldiers wait upon him at table instead of\r\nservants.  He never visited a sick person, until the chamber had been\r\nfirst searched, and the bed and bedding thoroughly examined.  At other\r\ntimes, all persons who came to pay their court to him were strictly\r\nsearched by officers appointed for that purpose; nor was it until after a\r\nlong time, and with much difficulty, that he was prevailed upon to excuse\r\nwomen, boys, and girls from such rude handling, or suffer their\r\nattendants or writing-masters to retain their cases for pens and styles.\r\nWhen Camillus formed his plot against him, not doubting but his timidity\r\nmight be worked upon without a war, he wrote to him a scurrilous,\r\npetulant, and threatening letter, desiring him to resign the government,\r\nand betake himself to a life of privacy.  Upon receiving this\r\nrequisition, he had some thoughts of complying with it, and summoned\r\ntogether the principal men of the city, to consult with them on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nXXXVI.  Having heard some loose reports of conspiracies formed against\r\nhim, he was so much alarmed, that he thought of immediately abdicating\r\nthe government.  And when, as I have before related, a man armed with a\r\ndagger was discovered near him while he was sacrificing, he instantly\r\nordered the heralds to convoke the senate, and with tears and dismal\r\nexclamations, lamented that such was his condition, that he was safe no\r\nwhere; and for a long time afterwards he abstained from appearing in\r\npublic.  He smothered his ardent love for Messalina, not so much on\r\naccount of her infamous conduct, as from apprehension of danger;\r\nbelieving that she aspired to share with Silius, her partner in adultery,\r\nthe imperial dignity.  (326) Upon this occasion he ran in a great fright,\r\nand a very shameful manner, to the camp, asking all the way he went, “if\r\nthe empire were indeed safely his?”\r\n\r\nXXXVII.  No suspicion was too trifling, no person on whom it rested too\r\ncontemptible, to throw him into a panic, and induce him to take\r\nprecautions for his safety, and meditate revenge.  A man engaged in a\r\nlitigation before his tribunal, having saluted him, drew him aside, and\r\ntold him he had dreamt that he saw him murdered; and shortly afterwards,\r\nwhen his adversary came to deliver his plea to the emperor, the\r\nplaintiff, pretending to have discovered the murderer, pointed to him as\r\nthe man he had seen in his dream; whereupon, as if he had been taken in\r\nthe act, he was hurried away to execution.  We are informed, that Appius\r\nSilanus was got rid of in the same manner, by a contrivance betwixt\r\nMessalina and Narcissus, in which they had their several parts assigned\r\nthem.  Narcissus therefore burst into his lord’s chamber before daylight,\r\napparently in great fright, and told him that he had dreamt that Appius\r\nSilanus had murdered him.  The empress, upon this, affecting great\r\nsurprise, declared she had the like dream for several nights\r\nsuccessively.  Presently afterwards, word was brought, as it had been\r\nagreed on, that Appius was come, he having, indeed, received orders the\r\npreceding day to be there at that time; and, as if the truth of the dream\r\nwas sufficiently confirmed by his appearance at that juncture, he was\r\nimmediately ordered to be prosecuted and put to death.  The day\r\nfollowing, Claudius related the whole affair to the senate, and\r\nacknowledged his great obligation to his freedmen for watching over him\r\neven in his sleep.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.  Sensible of his being subject to passion and resentment, he\r\nexcused himself in both instances by a proclamation, assuring the public\r\nthat “the former should be short and harmless, and the latter never\r\nwithout good cause.”  After severely reprimanding the people of Ostia for\r\nnot sending some boats to meet him upon his entering the mouth of the\r\nTiber, in terms which might expose them to the public resentment, he\r\nwrote to Rome that he had been treated as a private person; yet\r\nimmediately afterwards he pardoned them, and that in a way which had the\r\nappearance of making them (327) satisfaction, or begging pardon for some\r\ninjury he had done them.  Some people who addressed him unseasonably in\r\npublic, he pushed away with his own hand.  He likewise banished a person\r\nwho had been secretary to a quaestor, and even a senator who had filled\r\nthe office of praetor, without a hearing, and although they were\r\ninnocent; the former only because he had treated him with rudeness while\r\nhe was in a private station, and the other, because in his aedileship he\r\nhad fined some tenants of his, for selling cooked victuals contrary to\r\nlaw, and ordered his steward, who interfered, to be whipped.  On this\r\naccount, likewise, he took from the aediles the jurisdiction they had\r\nover cooks’-shops.  He did not scruple to speak of his own absurdities,\r\nand declared in some short speeches which he published, that he had only\r\nfeigned imbecility in the reign of Caius, because otherwise it would have\r\nbeen impossible for him to have escaped and arrived at the station he had\r\nthen attained.  He could not, however, gain credit for this assertion;\r\nfor a short time afterwards, a book was published under the title of\r\nMoron anastasis, “The Resurrection of Fools,” the design of which was to\r\nshow “that nobody ever counterfeited folly.”\r\n\r\nXXXIX.  Amongst other things, people admired in him his indifference and\r\nunconcern; or, to express it in Greek, his meteoria and ablepsia.\r\nPlacing himself at table a little after Messalina’s death, he enquired,\r\n“Why the empress did not come?”  Many of those whom he had condemned to\r\ndeath, he ordered the day after to be invited to his table, and to game\r\nwith him, and sent to reprimand them as sluggish fellows for not making\r\ngreater haste.  When he was meditating his incestuous marriage with\r\nAgrippina, he was perpetually calling her, “My daughter, my nursling,\r\nborn and brought up upon my lap.”  And when he was going to adopt Nero,\r\nas if there was little cause for censure in his adopting a son-in-law,\r\nwhen he had a son of his own arrived at years of maturity; he continually\r\ngave out in public, “that no one had ever been admitted by adoption into\r\nthe Claudian family.”\r\n\r\nXL.  He frequently appeared so careless in what he said, and so\r\ninattentive to circumstances, that it was believed he never reflected who\r\nhe himself was, or amongst whom, or at (328) what time, or in what place,\r\nhe spoke.  In a debate in the senate relative to the butchers and\r\nvintners, he cried out, “I ask you, who can live without a bit of meat?”\r\n And mentioned the great plenty of old taverns, from which he himself used\r\nformerly to have his wine.  Among other reasons for his supporting a\r\ncertain person who was candidate for the quaestorship, he gave this: “His\r\nfather,” said he, “once gave me, very seasonably, a draught of cold water\r\nwhen I was sick.”  Upon his bringing a woman as a witness in some cause\r\nbefore the senate, he said, “This woman was my mother’s freedwoman and\r\ndresser, but she always considered me as her master; and this I say,\r\nbecause there are some still in my family that do not look upon me as\r\nsuch.”  The people of Ostia addressing him in open court with a petition,\r\nhe flew into a rage at them, and said, “There is no reason why I should\r\noblige you: if any one else is free to act as he pleases, surely I am.”\r\n The following expressions he had in his mouth every day, and at all hours\r\nand seasons: “What! do you take me for a Theogonius?” [541]  And in Greek\r\nlalei kai mae thingane, “Speak, but do not touch me;” besides many other\r\nfamiliar sentences, below the dignity of a private person, much more of\r\nan emperor, who was not deficient either in eloquence or learning, as\r\nhaving applied himself very closely to the liberal sciences.\r\n\r\nXLI.  By the encouragement of Titus Livius [542], and with the assistance\r\nof Sulpicius Flavus, he attempted at an early age the composition of a\r\nhistory; and having called together a numerous auditory, to hear and give\r\ntheir judgment upon it, he read it over with much difficulty, and\r\nfrequently interrupting himself.  For after he had begun, a great laugh\r\nwas raised amongst the company, by the breaking of several benches from\r\nthe weight of a very fat man; and even when order was restored, he could\r\nnot forbear bursting out into violent fits of laughter, at the\r\nremembrance of the accident.  After he became emperor, likewise, he wrote\r\nseveral things (329) which he was careful to have recited to his friends\r\nby a reader.  He commenced his history from the death of the dictator\r\nCaesar; but afterwards he took a later period, and began at the\r\nconclusion of the civil wars; because he found he could not speak with\r\nfreedom, and a due regard to truth, concerning the former period, having\r\nbeen often taken to task both by his mother and grandmother.  Of the\r\nearlier history he left only two books, but of the latter, one and forty.\r\nHe compiled likewise the “History of his Own Life,” in eight books, full\r\nof absurdities, but in no bad style; also, “A Defence of Cicero against\r\nthe Books of Asinius Gallus,” [543] which exhibited a considerable degree\r\nof learning.  He besides invented three new letters, and added them to\r\nthe former alphabet [544], as highly necessary.  He published a book to\r\nrecommend them while he was yet only a private person; but on his\r\nelevation to imperial power he had little difficulty in introducing them\r\ninto common use; and these letters are still extant in a variety of\r\nbooks, registers, and inscriptions upon buildings.\r\n\r\nXLII.  He applied himself with no less attention to the study of Grecian\r\nliterature, asserting upon all occasions his love of that language, and\r\nits surpassing excellency.  A stranger once holding a discourse both in\r\nGreek and Latin, he addressed him thus; “Since you are skilled in both\r\nour tongues.”  And recommending Achaia to the favour of the senate, he\r\nsaid, “I have a particular attachment to that province, on account of our\r\ncommon studies.”  In the senate he often made long replies to ambassadors\r\nin that language.  On the tribunal he frequently quoted the verses of\r\nHomer.  When at any time he had taken vengeance on an enemy or a\r\nconspirator, he scarcely ever gave to the tribune on guard, who, (330)\r\naccording to custom, came for the word, any other than this.\r\n\r\n    Andr’ epamynastai, ote tis proteros chalepaenae.\r\n    ‘Tis time to strike when wrong demands the blow.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, he wrote some histories likewise in Greek, namely, twenty\r\nbooks on Tuscan affairs, and eight on the Carthaginian; in consequence of\r\nwhich, another museum was founded at Alexandria, in addition to the old\r\none, and called after his name; and it was ordered, that, upon certain\r\ndays in every year, his Tuscan history should be read over in one of\r\nthese, and his Carthaginian in the other, as in a school; each history\r\nbeing read through by persons who took it in turn.\r\n\r\nXLIII.  Towards the close of his life, he gave some manifest indications\r\nthat he repented of his marriage with Agrippina, and his adoption of\r\nNero.  For some of his freedmen noticing with approbation his having\r\ncondemned, the day before, a woman accused of adultery, he remarked, “It\r\nhas been my misfortune to have wives who have been unfaithful to my bed;\r\nbut they did not escape punishment.”  Often, when he happened to meet\r\nBritannicus, he would embrace him tenderly, and express a desire “that he\r\nmight grow apace,” and receive from him an account of all his actions:\r\nusing the Greek phrase, “o trosas kai iasetai,--He who has wounded will\r\nalso heal.”  And intending to give him the manly habit, while he was yet\r\nunder age and a tender youth, because his stature would allow of it, he\r\nadded, “I do so, that the Roman people may at last have a real Caesar.”\r\n [545]\r\n\r\nXLIV.  Soon afterwards he made his will, and had it signed by all the\r\nmagistrates as witnesses.  But he was prevented from proceeding further\r\nby Agrippina, accused by her own guilty conscience, as well as by\r\ninformers, of a variety of crimes.  It is agreed that he was taken off by\r\npoison; but where, and by whom administered, remains in uncertainty.\r\nSome authors say that it was given him as he was feasting with the\r\npriests in the Capitol, by the eunuch Halotus, his taster.  Others say\r\n(331) by Agrippina, at his own table, in mushrooms, a dish of which he\r\nwas very fond [546].  The accounts of what followed likewise differ.\r\nSome relate that he instantly became speechless, was racked with pain\r\nthrough the night, and died about day-break; others, that at first he\r\nfell into a sound sleep, and afterwards, his food rising, he threw up the\r\nwhole; but had another dose given him; whether in water-gruel, under\r\npretence of refreshment after his exhaustion, or in a clyster, as if\r\ndesigned to relieve his bowels, is likewise uncertain.\r\n\r\nXLV.  His death was kept secret until everything was settled relative to\r\nhis successor.  Accordingly, vows were made for his recovery, and\r\ncomedians were called to amuse him, as it was pretended, by his own\r\ndesire.  He died upon the third of the ides of October [13th October], in\r\nthe consulship of Asinius Marcellus and Acilius Aviola, in the\r\nsixty-fourth year of his age, and the fourteenth of his reign [547]. His\r\nfuneral was celebrated with the customary imperial pomp, and he was\r\nranked amongst the gods.  This honour was taken from him by Nero, but\r\nrestored by Vespasian.\r\n\r\nXLVI.  The chief presages of his death were, the appearance of a comet,\r\nhis father Drusus’s monument being struck by lightning, and the death of\r\nmost of the magistrates of all ranks that year.  It appears from several\r\ncircumstances, that he was sensible of his approaching dissolution, and\r\nmade no secret of it.  For when he nominated the consuls, he appointed no\r\none to fill the office beyond the month in which he died.  At the last\r\nassembly of the senate in which he made his appearance, he earnestly\r\nexhorted his two sons to unity with each other, and with earnest\r\nentreaties commended to the fathers the care of their tender years.  And\r\nin the last cause he heard from the tribunal, he repeatedly declared in\r\nopen court, “That he was now arrived at the last stage of mortal\r\nexistence;” whilst all who heard it shrunk at hearing these ominous\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe violent death of Caligula afforded the Romans a fresh opportunity to\r\nhave asserted the liberty of their country; but the conspirators had\r\nconcerted no plan, by which they should proceed upon the assassination of\r\nthat tyrant; and the indecision of the senate, in a debate of two days,\r\non so sudden an emergency, gave time to the caprice of the soldiers to\r\ninterpose in the settlement of the government.  By an accident the most\r\nfortuitous, a man devoid of all pretensions to personal merit, so weak in\r\nunderstanding as to be the common sport of the emperor’s household, and\r\nan object of contempt even to his own kindred; this man, in the hour of\r\nmilitary insolence, was nominated by the soldiers as successor to the\r\nRoman throne.  Not yet in possession of the public treasury, which\r\nperhaps was exhausted, he could not immediately reward the services of\r\nhis electors with a pecuniary gratification; but he promised them a\r\nlargess of fifteen thousand sesterces a man, upwards of a hundred and\r\nforty pounds sterling; and as we meet with no account of any subsequent\r\ndiscontents in the army, we may justly conclude that the promise was soon\r\nafter fulfilled.  This transaction laid the foundation of that military\r\ndespotism, which, through many succeeding ages, convulsed the Roman\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nBesides the interposition of the soldiers upon this occasion, it appears\r\nthat the populace of Rome were extremely clamorous for the government of\r\na single person, and for that of Claudius in particular.  This partiality\r\nfor a monarchical government proceeded from two causes.  The commonalty,\r\nfrom their obscure situation, were always the least exposed to\r\noppression, under a tyrannical prince.  They had likewise ever been\r\nremarkably fond of stage-plays and public shows, with which, as well as\r\nwith scrambles, and donations of bread and other victuals, the preceding\r\nemperor had frequently gratified them.  They had therefore less to fear,\r\nand more to hope, from the government of a single person than any other\r\nclass of Roman citizens.  With regard to the partiality for Claudius, it\r\nmay be accounted for partly from the low habits of life to which he had\r\nbeen addicted, in consequence of which many of them were familiarly\r\nacquainted with him; and this circumstance likewise increased their hope\r\nof deriving some advantage from his accession.  Exclusive of all these\r\nconsiderations, it is highly probable that the populace were instigated\r\nin favour of Claudius by the artifices of his freedmen, persons of mean\r\nextraction, by whom he was afterwards entirely governed, and who, upon\r\nsuch an occasion, would exert their utmost efforts to procure his\r\nappointment to the throne.  From the debate in the senate having\r\ncontinued during (333) two days, it was evident that there was still a\r\nstrong party for restoring the ancient form of government.  That they\r\nwere in the end overawed by the clamour of the multitude, is not\r\nsurprising, when we consider that the senate was totally unprovided with\r\nresources of every kind for asserting the independence of the nation by\r\narms; and the commonalty, who interrupted their deliberations, were the\r\nonly people by whose assistance they ever could effect the restitution of\r\npublic freedom.  To this may be added, that the senate, by the total\r\nreduction of their political importance, ever since the overthrow of the\r\nrepublic, had lost both the influence and authority which they formerly\r\nenjoyed.  The extreme cruelty, likewise, which had been exercised during\r\nthe last two reigns, afforded a further motive for relinquishing all\r\nattempts in favour of liberty, as they might be severely revenged upon\r\nthemselves by the subsequent emperor: and it was a degree of moderation\r\nin Claudius, which palliates the injustice of his cause, that he began\r\nhis government with an act of amnesty respecting the public transactions\r\nwhich ensued upon the death of Caligula.\r\n\r\nClaudius, at the time of his accession, was fifty years of age; and\r\nthough he had hitherto lived apparently unambitious of public honours,\r\naccompanied with great ostentation, yet he was now seized with a desire\r\nto enjoy a triumph.  As there existed no war, in which he might perform\r\nsome military achievement, his vanity could only be gratified by invading\r\na foreign country, where, contrary to the advice contained in the\r\ntestament of Augustus, he might attempt to extend still further the\r\nlimits of the empire.  Either Britain, therefore, or some nation on the\r\ncontinent, at a great distance from the capital, became the object of\r\nsuch an enterprize; and the former was chosen, not only as more\r\nconvenient, from its vicinity to the maritime province of Gaul, but on\r\naccount of a remonstrance lately presented by the Britons to the court of\r\nRome, respecting the protection afforded to some persons of that nation,\r\nwho had fled thither to elude the laws of their country.  Considering the\r\nstate of Britain at that time, divided as it was into a number of\r\nprincipalities, amongst which there was no general confederacy for mutual\r\ndefence, and where the alarm excited by the invasion of Julius Caesar,\r\nupwards of eighty years before, had long since been forgotten; a sudden\r\nattempt upon the island could not fail to be attended with success.\r\nAccordingly, an army was sent over, under the command of Aulus Plautius,\r\nan able general, who defeated the natives in several engagements, and\r\npenetrated a considerable way into the country.  Preparations for the\r\nemperor’s voyage now being made, Claudius set sail from Ostia, at the\r\nmouth of (334) the Tiber; but meeting with a violent storm in the\r\nMediterranean, he landed at Marseilles, and proceeding thence to Boulogne\r\nin Picardy, passed over into Britain.  In what part he debarked, is\r\nuncertain, but it seems to have been at some place on the south-east\r\ncoast of the island.  He immediately received the submission of several\r\nBritish states, the Cantii, Atrebates, Regni, and Trinobantes, who\r\ninhabited those parts; and returning to Rome, after an absence of six\r\nmonths, celebrated with great pomp the triumph, for which he had\r\nundertaken the expedition.\r\n\r\nIn the interior parts of Britain, the natives, under the command of\r\nCaractacus, maintained an obstinate resistance, and little progress was\r\nmade by the Roman arms, until Ostorius Scapula was sent over to prosecute\r\nthe war.  He penetrated into the country of the Silures, a warlike tribe,\r\nwho inhabited the banks of the Severn; and having defeated Caractacus in\r\na great battle, made him prisoner, and sent him to Rome.  The fame of the\r\nBritish prince had by this time spread over the provinces of Gaul and\r\nItaly; and upon his arrival in the Roman capital, the people flocked from\r\nall quarters to behold him.  The ceremonial of his entrance was conducted\r\nwith great solemnity.  On a plain adjoining the Roman camp, the pretorian\r\ntroops were drawn up in martial array: the emperor and his court took\r\ntheir station in front of the lines, and behind them was ranged the whole\r\nbody of the people.  The procession commenced with the different trophies\r\nwhich had been taken from the Britons during the progress of the war.\r\nNext followed the brothers of the vanquished prince, with his wife and\r\ndaughter, in chains, expressing by their supplicating looks and gestures\r\nthe fears with which they were actuated.  But not so Caractacus himself.\r\nWith a manly gait and an undaunted countenance, he marched up to the\r\ntribunal, where the emperor was seated, and addressed him in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n“If to my high birth and distinguished rank, I had added the virtues of\r\nmoderation, Rome had beheld me rather as a friend than a captive; and you\r\nwould not have rejected an alliance with a prince, descended from\r\nillustrious ancestors, and governing many nations.  The reverse of my\r\nfortune to you is glorious, and to me humiliating.  I had arms, and men,\r\nand horses; I possessed extraordinary riches; and can it be any wonder\r\nthat I was unwilling to lose them?  Because Rome aspires to universal\r\ndominion, must men therefore implicitly resign themselves to subjection?\r\nI opposed for a long time the progress of your arms, and had I acted\r\notherwise, would either you have had the glory of conquest, or I of a\r\nbrave resistance?  I am now in your (335) power: if you are determined to\r\ntake revenge, my fate will soon be forgotten, and you will derive no\r\nhonour from the transaction.  Preserve my life, and I shall remain to the\r\nlatest ages a monument of your clemency.”\r\n\r\nImmediately upon this speech, Claudius granted him his liberty, as he did\r\nlikewise to the other royal captives.  They all returned their thanks in\r\na manner the most grateful to the emperor; and as soon as their chains\r\nwere taken off, walking towards Agrippina, who sat upon a bench at a\r\nlittle distance, they repeated to her the same fervent declarations of\r\ngratitude and esteem.\r\n\r\nHistory has preserved no account of Caractacus after this period; but it\r\nis probable, that he returned in a short time to his own country, where\r\nhis former valour, and the magnanimity, which he had displayed at Rome,\r\nwould continue to render him illustrious through life, even amidst the\r\nirretrievable ruin of his fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary character in the present reign was that of Valeria\r\nMessalina, the daughter of Valerius Messala Barbatus.  She was married to\r\nClaudius, and had by him a son and a daughter.  To cruelty in the\r\nprosecution of her purposes, she added the most abandoned incontinence.\r\nNot confining her licentiousness within the limits of the palace, where\r\nshe committed the most shameful excesses, she prostituted her person in\r\nthe common stews, and even in the public streets of the capital.  As if\r\nher conduct was already not sufficiently scandalous, she obliged C.\r\nSilius, a man of consular rank, to divorce his wife, that she might\r\nprocure his company entirely to herself.  Not contented with this\r\nindulgence to her criminal passion, she next persuaded him to marry her;\r\nand during an excursion which the emperor made to Ostia, the ceremony of\r\nmarriage was actually performed between them.  The occasion was\r\ncelebrated with a magnificent supper, to which she invited a large\r\ncompany; and lest the whole should be regarded as a frolic, not meant to\r\nbe consummated, the adulterous parties ascended the nuptial couch in the\r\npresence of the astonished spectators.  Great as was the facility of\r\nClaudius’s temper in respect of her former behaviour, he could not\r\noverlook so flagrant a violation both of public decency and the laws of\r\nthe country.  Silius was condemned to death for the adultery which he had\r\nperpetrated with reluctance; and Messalina was ordered into the emperor’s\r\npresence, to answer for her conduct.  Terror now operating upon her mind\r\nin conjunction with remorse, she could not summon the resolution to\r\nsupport such an interview, but retired into the gardens of Lucullus,\r\nthere to indulge at last the compunction which she felt for her crimes,\r\nand to meditate the entreaties by which she should endeavour to soothe\r\nthe resentment (336) of her husband.  In the extremity of her distress,\r\nshe attempted to lay violent hands upon herself, but her courage was not\r\nequal to the emergency.  Her mother, Lepida, who had not spoken with her\r\nfor some years before, was present upon the occasion, and urged her to\r\nthe act which alone could put a period to her infamy and wretchedness.\r\nAgain she made an effort, but again her resolution abandoned her; when a\r\ntribune burst into the gardens, and plunging his sword into her body, she\r\ninstantly expired.  Thus perished a woman, the scandal of whose lewdness\r\nresounded throughout the empire, and of whom a great satirist, then\r\nliving, has said, perhaps without a hyperbole,\r\n\r\n    Et lassata viris, necdum satiata, recessit.--Juvenal, Sat. VI.\r\n\r\nIt has been already observed, that Claudius was entirely governed by his\r\nfreedmen; a class of retainers which enjoyed a great share of favour and\r\nconfidence with their patrons in those times.  They had before been the\r\nslaves of their masters, and had obtained their freedom as a reward for\r\ntheir faithful and attentive services.  Of the esteem in which they were\r\noften held, we meet with an instance in Tiro, the freedman of Cicero, to\r\nwhom that illustrious Roman addresses several epistles, written in the\r\nmost familiar and affectionate strain of friendship.  As it was common\r\nfor them to be taught the more useful parts of education in the families\r\nof their masters, they were usually well qualified for the management of\r\ndomestic concerns, and might even be competent to the superior\r\ndepartments of the state, especially in those times when negotiations and\r\ntreaties with foreign princes seldom or never occurred; and in arbitrary\r\ngovernments, where public affairs were directed more by the will of the\r\nsovereign or his ministers, than by refined suggestions of policy.\r\n\r\nFrom the character generally given of Claudius before his elevation to\r\nthe throne, we should not readily imagine that he was endowed with any\r\ntaste for literary composition; yet he seems to have exclusively enjoyed\r\nthis distinction during his own reign, in which learning was at a low\r\nebb.  Besides history, Suetonius informs us that he wrote a Defence of\r\nCicero against the Charges of Asinius Gallus.  This appears to be the\r\nonly tribute of esteem or approbation paid to the character of Cicero,\r\nfrom the time of Livy the historian, to the extinction of the race of the\r\nCaesars.  Asinius Gallus was the son of Asinius Pollio, the orator.\r\nMarrying Vipsania after she had been divorced by Tiberius, he incurred\r\nthe displeasure of that emperor, and died of famine, either voluntarily,\r\nor by order of the tyrant.  He wrote a comparison between his father and\r\nCicero, in which, with more filial partiality than justice, he gave the\r\npreference to the former.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNERO CLAUDIUS CAESAR.\r\n\r\n(337)\r\n\r\nI.  Two celebrated families, the Calvini and Aenobarbi, sprung from the\r\nrace of the Domitii.  The Aenobarbi derive both their extraction and\r\ntheir cognomen from one Lucius Domitius, of whom we have this tradition:\r\n--As he was returning out of the country to Rome, he was met by two young\r\nmen of a most august appearance, who desired him to announce to the\r\nsenate and people a victory, of which no certain intelligence had yet\r\nreached the city.  To prove that they were more than mortals, they\r\nstroked his cheeks, and thus changed his hair, which was black, to a\r\nbright colour, resembling that of brass; which mark of distinction\r\ndescended to his posterity, for they had generally red beards.  This\r\nfamily had the honour of seven consulships [548], one triumph [549], and\r\ntwo censorships [550]; and being admitted into the patrician order, they\r\ncontinued the use of the same cognomen, with no other praenomina [551]\r\nthan those of Cneius and Lucius.  These, however, they assumed with\r\nsingular irregularity; three persons in succession sometimes adhering to\r\none of them, and then they were changed alternately.  For the first,\r\nsecond, and third of the Aenobarbi had the praenomen of Lucius, and again\r\nthe three following, successively, that of Cneius, while those who came\r\nafter were called, by turns, one, Lucius, and the other, Cneius.  It\r\nappears to me proper to give a short account of several of the family, to\r\nshow that Nero so far degenerated from the noble qualities of his\r\nancestors, that he retained only their vices; as if those alone had been\r\ntransmitted to him by his descent.\r\n\r\nII.  To begin, therefore, at a remote period, his great-grandfather’s\r\ngrandfather, Cneius Domitius, when he was tribune of the people, being\r\noffended with the high priests for electing another than himself in the\r\nroom of his father, obtained the (338) transfer of the right of election\r\nfrom the colleges of the priests to the people.  In his consulship [552],\r\nhaving conquered the Allobroges and the Arverni [553], he made a progress\r\nthrough the province, mounted upon an elephant, with a body of soldiers\r\nattending him, in a sort of triumphal pomp.  Of this person the orator\r\nLicinius Crassus said, “It was no wonder he had a brazen beard, who had a\r\nface of iron, and a heart of lead.”  His son, during his praetorship\r\n[554], proposed that Cneius Caesar, upon the expiration of his\r\nconsulship, should be called to account before the senate for his\r\nadministration of that office, which was supposed to be contrary both to\r\nthe omens and the laws.  Afterwards, when he was consul himself [555], he\r\ntried to deprive Cneius of the command of the army, and having been, by\r\nintrigue and cabal, appointed his successor, he was made prisoner at\r\nCorsinium, in the beginning of the civil war.  Being set at liberty, he\r\nwent to Marseilles, which was then besieged; where having, by his\r\npresence, animated the people to hold out, he suddenly deserted them, and\r\nat last was slain in the battle of Pharsalia.  He was a man of little\r\nconstancy, and of a sullen temper.  In despair of his fortunes, he had\r\nrecourse to poison, but was so terrified at the thoughts of death, that,\r\nimmediately repenting, he took a vomit to throw it up again, and gave\r\nfreedom to his physician for having, with great prudence and wisdom,\r\ngiven him only a gentle dose of the poison.  When Cneius Pompey was\r\nconsulting with his friends in what manner he should conduct himself\r\ntowards those who were neuter and took no part in the contest, he was the\r\nonly one who proposed that they should be treated as enemies.\r\n\r\nIII.  He left a son, who was, without doubt, the best of the family.  By\r\nthe Pedian law, he was condemned, although innocent, amongst others who\r\nwere concerned in the death of Caesar [556].  Upon this, he went over to\r\nBrutus and Cassius, his near relations; and, after their death, not only\r\nkept together the fleet, the command of which had been given him some\r\ntime before, but even increased it.  At last, when the party had\r\neverywhere been defeated, he voluntarily surrendered it to (339) Mark\r\nAntony; considering it as a piece of service for which the latter owed\r\nhim no small obligations.  Of all those who were condemned by the law\r\nabove-mentioned, he was the only man who was restored to his country, and\r\nfilled the highest offices.  When the civil war again broke out, he was\r\nappointed lieutenant under the same Antony, and offered the chief command\r\nby those who were ashamed of Cleopatra; but not daring, on account of a\r\nsudden indisposition with which he was seized, either to accept or refuse\r\nit, he went over to Augustus [557], and died a few days after, not\r\nwithout an aspersion cast upon his memory.  For Antony gave out, that he\r\nwas induced to change sides by his impatience to be with his mistress,\r\nServilia Nais. [558]\r\n\r\nIV.  This Cneius had a son, named Domitius, who was afterwards well known\r\nas the nominal purchaser of the family property left by Augustus’s will\r\n[559]; and no less famous in his youth for his dexterity in\r\nchariot-driving, than he was afterwards for the triumphal ornaments which\r\nhe obtained in the German war.  But he was a man of great arrogance,\r\nprodigality, and cruelty.  When he was aedile, he obliged Lucius Plancus,\r\nthe censor, to give him the way; and in his praetorship, and consulship,\r\nhe made Roman knights and married women act on the stage.  He gave hunts\r\nof wild beasts, both in the Circus and in all the wards of the city; as\r\nalso a show of gladiators; but with such barbarity, that Augustus, after\r\nprivately reprimanding him, to no purpose, was obliged to restrain him by\r\na public edict.\r\n\r\nV.  By the elder Antonia he had Nero’s father, a man of execrable\r\ncharacter in every part of his life.  During his attendance upon Caius\r\nCaesar in the East, he killed a freedman of his own, for refusing to\r\ndrink as much as he ordered him.  Being dismissed for this from Caesar’s\r\nsociety, he did not mend his habits; for, in a village upon the Appian\r\nroad, he suddenly whipped his horses, and drove his chariot, on purpose,\r\n(340) over a poor boy, crushing him to pieces.  At Rome, he struck out\r\nthe eye of a Roman knight in the Forum, only for some free language in a\r\ndispute between them.  He was likewise so fraudulent, that he not only\r\ncheated some silversmiths [560] of the price of goods he had bought of\r\nthem, but, during his praetorship, defrauded the owners of chariots in\r\nthe Circensian games of the prizes due to them for their victory.  His\r\nsister, jeering him for the complaints made by the leaders of the several\r\nparties, he agreed to sanction a law, “That, for the future, the prizes\r\nshould be immediately paid.”  A little before the death of Tiberius, he\r\nwas prosecuted for treason, adulteries, and incest with his sister\r\nLepida, but escaped in the timely change of affairs, and died of a\r\ndropsy, at Pyrgi [561]; leaving behind him his son, Nero, whom he had by\r\nAgrippina, the daughter of Germanicus.\r\n\r\nVI.  Nero was born at Antium, nine months after the death of Tiberius\r\n[562], upon the eighteenth of the calends of January [15th December],\r\njust as the sun rose, so that its beams touched him before they could\r\nwell reach the earth.  While many fearful conjectures, in respect to his\r\nfuture fortune, were formed by different persons, from the circumstances\r\nof his nativity, a saying of his father, Domitius, was regarded as an ill\r\npresage, who told his friends who were congratulating him upon the\r\noccasion, “That nothing but what was detestable, and pernicious to the\r\npublic, could ever be produced of him and Agrippina.”  Another manifest\r\nprognostic of his future infelicity occurred upon his lustration day\r\n[563].  For Caius Caesar being requested by his sister to give the child\r\nwhat name he thought proper--looking at his uncle, Claudius, who (341)\r\nafterwards, when emperor, adopted Nero, he gave his: and this not\r\nseriously, but only in jest; Agrippina treating it with contempt, because\r\nClaudius at that time was a mere laughing-stock at the palace.  He lost\r\nhis father when he was three years old, being left heir to a third part\r\nof his estate; of which he never got possession, the whole being seized\r\nby his co-heir, Caius.  His mother being soon after banished, he lived\r\nwith his aunt Lepida, in a very necessitous condition, under the care of\r\ntwo tutors, a dancing-master and a barber.  After Claudius came to the\r\nempire, he not only recovered his father’s estate, but was enriched with\r\nthe additional inheritance of that of his step-father, Crispus Passienus.\r\nUpon his mother’s recall from banishment, he was advanced to such favour,\r\nthrough Nero’s powerful interest with the emperor, that it was reported,\r\nassassins were employed by Messalina, Claudius’s wife, to strangle him,\r\nas Britannicus’s rival, whilst he was taking his noon-day repose.  In\r\naddition to the story, it was said that they were frightened by a\r\nserpent, which crept from under his cushion, and ran away.  The tale was\r\noccasioned by finding on his couch, near the pillow, the skin of a snake,\r\nwhich, by his mother’s order, he wore for some time upon his right arm,\r\ninclosed in a bracelet of gold.  This amulet, at last, he laid aside,\r\nfrom aversion to her memory; but he sought for it again, in vain, in the\r\ntime of his extremity.\r\n\r\nVII.  When he was yet a mere boy, before he arrived at the age of\r\npuberty, during the celebration of the Circensian games [564], he\r\nperformed his part in the Trojan play with a degree of firmness which\r\ngained him great applause.  In the eleventh year of his age, he was\r\nadopted by Claudius, and placed under the tuition of Annaeus Seneca\r\n[565], who had been made a senator.  It is said, that Seneca dreamt the\r\nnight after, that he was giving a lesson to Caius Caesar [566].  Nero\r\nsoon verified his dream, betraying the cruelty of his disposition in\r\nevery way he could.  For he attempted to persuade his father that his\r\nbrother, Britannicus, was nothing but a changeling, because the latter\r\nhad (342) saluted him, notwithstanding his adoption, by the name of\r\nAenobarbus, as usual.  When his aunt, Lepida, was brought to trial, he\r\nappeared in court as a witness against her, to gratify his mother, who\r\npersecuted the accused.  On his introduction into the Forum, at the age\r\nof manhood, he gave a largess to the people and a donative to the\r\nsoldiers: for the pretorian cohorts, he appointed a solemn procession\r\nunder arms, and marched at the head of them with a shield in his hand;\r\nafter which he went to return thanks to his father in the senate.  Before\r\nClaudius, likewise, at the time he was consul, he made a speech for the\r\nBolognese, in Latin, and for the Rhodians and people of Ilium, in Greek.\r\nHe had the jurisdiction of praefect of the city, for the first time,\r\nduring the Latin festival; during which the most celebrated advocates\r\nbrought before him, not short and trifling causes, as is usual in that\r\ncase, but trials of importance, notwithstanding they had instructions\r\nfrom Claudius himself to the contrary.  Soon afterwards, he married\r\nOctavia, and exhibited the Circensian games, and hunting of wild beasts,\r\nin honour of Claudius.\r\n\r\nVIII.  He was seventeen years of age at the death of that prince [567],\r\nand as soon as that event was made public, he went out to the cohort on\r\nguard between the hours of six and seven; for the omens were so\r\ndisastrous, that no earlier time of the day was judged proper.  On the\r\nsteps before the palace gate, he was unanimously saluted by the soldiers\r\nas their emperor, and then carried in a litter to the camp; thence, after\r\nmaking a short speech to the troops, into the senate-house, where he\r\ncontinued until the evening; of all the immense honours which were heaped\r\nupon him, refusing none but the title of FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY, on\r\naccount of his youth,\r\n\r\nIX.  He began his reign with an ostentation of dutiful regard to the\r\nmemory of Claudius, whom he buried with the utmost pomp and magnificence,\r\npronouncing the funeral oration himself, and then had him enrolled\r\namongst the gods.  He paid likewise the highest honours to the memory of\r\nhis father Domitius.  He left the management of affairs, both public and\r\nprivate, to his mother.  The word which he gave the first day of his\r\nreign to the tribune on guard, was, “The (343) Best of Mothers,” and\r\nafterwards he frequently appeared with her in the streets of Rome in her\r\nlitter.  He settled a colony at Antium, in which he placed the veteran\r\nsoldiers belonging to the guards; and obliged several of the richest\r\ncenturions of the first rank to transfer their residence to that place;\r\nwhere he likewise made a noble harbour at a prodigious expense. [568]\r\n\r\nX.  To establish still further his character, he declared, “that he\r\ndesigned to govern according to the model of Augustus;” and omitted no\r\nopportunity of showing his generosity, clemency, and complaisance.  The\r\nmore burthensome taxes he either entirely took off, or diminished.  The\r\nrewards appointed for informers by the Papian law, he reduced to a fourth\r\npart, and distributed to the people four hundred sesterces a man.  To the\r\nnoblest of the senators who were much reduced in their circumstances, he\r\ngranted annual allowances, in some cases as much as five hundred thousand\r\nsesterces; and to the pretorian cohorts a monthly allowance of corn\r\ngratis.  When called upon to subscribe the sentence, according to custom,\r\nof a criminal condemned to die, “I wish,” said he, “I had never learnt to\r\nread and write.”  He continually saluted people of the several orders by\r\nname, without a prompter.  When the senate returned him their thanks for\r\nhis good government, he replied to them, “It will be time enough to do so\r\nwhen I shall have deserved it.”  He admitted the common people to see him\r\nperform his exercises in the Campus Martius.  He frequently declaimed in\r\npublic, and recited verses of his own composing, not only at home, but in\r\nthe theatre; so much to the joy of all the people, that public prayers\r\nwere appointed to be put up to the gods upon that account; and the verses\r\nwhich had been publicly read, were, after being written in gold letters,\r\nconsecrated to Jupiter Capitolinus.\r\n\r\n(344) XI.  He presented the people with a great number and variety of\r\nspectacles, as the Juvenal and Circensian games, stage-plays, and an\r\nexhibition of gladiators.  In the Juvenal, he even admitted senators and\r\naged matrons to perform parts.  In the Circensian games, he assigned the\r\nequestrian order seats apart from the rest of the people, and had races\r\nperformed by chariots drawn each by four camels.  In the games which he\r\ninstituted for the eternal duration of the empire, and therefore ordered\r\nto be called Maximi, many of the senatorian and equestrian order, of both\r\nsexes, performed.  A distinguished Roman knight descended on the stage by\r\na rope, mounted on an elephant.  A Roman play, likewise, composed by\r\nAfranius, was brought upon the stage.  It was entitled, “The Fire;” and\r\nin it the performers were allowed to carry off, and to keep to\r\nthemselves, the furniture of the house, which, as the plot of the play\r\nrequired, was burnt down in the theatre.  Every day during the solemnity,\r\nmany thousand articles of all descriptions were thrown amongst the people\r\nto scramble for; such as fowls of different kinds, tickets for corn,\r\nclothes, gold, silver, gems, pearls, pictures, slaves, beasts of burden,\r\nwild beasts that had been tamed; at last, ships, lots of houses, and\r\nlands, were offered as prizes in a lottery.\r\n\r\nXII.  These games he beheld from the front of the proscenium.  In the\r\nshow of gladiators, which he exhibited in a wooden amphitheatre, built\r\nwithin a year in the district of the Campus Martius [569], he ordered\r\nthat none should be slain, not even the condemned criminals employed in\r\nthe combats.  He secured four hundred senators, and six hundred Roman\r\nknights, amongst whom were some of unbroken fortunes and unblemished\r\nreputation, to act as gladiators.  From the same orders, he engaged\r\npersons to encounter wild beasts, and for various other services in the\r\ntheatre.  He presented the public with the representation of a naval\r\nfight, upon sea-water, with huge fishes swimming in it; as also with the\r\nPyrrhic dance, performed by certain youths, to each of whom, after the\r\nperformance was over, he granted the freedom of Rome.  During this\r\ndiversion, a bull covered Pasiphae, concealed within a wooden statue of a\r\ncow, as many of the spectators believed.  Icarus, upon his first attempt\r\nto fly, fell on the stage close to (345) the emperor’s pavilion, and\r\nbespattered him with blood.  For he very seldom presided in the games,\r\nbut used to view them reclining on a couch, at first through some narrow\r\napertures, but afterwards with the Podium [570] quite open.  He was the\r\nfirst who instituted [571], in imitation of the Greeks, a trial of skill\r\nin the three several exercises of music, wrestling, and horse-racing, to\r\nbe performed at Rome every five years, and which he called Neronia.  Upon\r\nthe dedication of his bath [572] and gymnasium, he furnished the senate\r\nand the equestrian order with oil.  He appointed as judges of the trial\r\nmen of consular rank, chosen by lot, who sat with the praetors.  At this\r\ntime he went down into the orchestra amongst the senators, and received\r\nthe crown for the best performance in Latin prose and verse, for which\r\nseveral persons of the greatest merit contended, but they unanimously\r\nyielded to him.  The crown for the best performer on the harp, being\r\nlikewise awarded to him by the judges, he devoutly saluted it, and\r\nordered it to be carried to the statue of Augustus.  In the gymnastic\r\nexercises, which he presented in the Septa, while they were preparing the\r\ngreat sacrifice of an ox, he shaved his beard for the first time [573],\r\nand putting it up in a casket of gold studded with pearls of great price,\r\nconsecrated it to Jupiter Capitolinus.  He invited the Vestal Virgins to\r\nsee the (346) wrestlers perform, because, at Olympia, the priestesses of\r\nCeres are allowed the privilege of witnessing that exhibition.\r\n\r\nXIII.  Amongst the spectacles presented by him, the solemn entrance of\r\nTiridates [574] into the city deserves to be mentioned.  This personage,\r\nwho was king of Armenia, he invited to Rome by very liberal promises.\r\nBut being prevented by unfavourable weather from showing him to the\r\npeople upon the day fixed by proclamation, he took the first opportunity\r\nwhich occurred; several cohorts being drawn up under arms, about the\r\ntemples in the forum, while he was seated on a curule chair on the\r\nrostra, in a triumphal dress, amidst the military standards and ensigns.\r\nUpon Tiridates advancing towards him, on a stage made shelving for the\r\npurpose, he permitted him to throw himself at his feet, but quickly\r\nraised him with his right hand, and kissed him.  The emperor then, at the\r\nking’s request, took the turban from his head, and replaced it by a\r\ncrown, whilst a person of pretorian rank proclaimed in Latin the words in\r\nwhich the prince addressed the emperor as a suppliant.  After this\r\nceremony, the king was conducted to the theatre, where, after renewing\r\nhis obeisance, Nero seated him on his right hand.  Being then greeted by\r\nuniversal acclamation with the title of Emperor, and sending his laurel\r\ncrown to the Capitol, Nero shut the temple of the two-faced Janus, as\r\nthough there now existed no war throughout the Roman empire.\r\n\r\nXIV.  He filled the consulship four times [575]: the first for two\r\nmonths, the second and last for six, and the third for four; the two\r\nintermediate ones he held successively, but the others after an interval\r\nof some years between them.\r\n\r\nXV.  In the administration of justice, he scarcely ever gave his decision\r\non the pleadings before the next day, and then in writing.  His manner of\r\nhearing causes was not to allow any adjournment, but to dispatch them in\r\norder as they stood.  When he withdrew to consult his assessors, he did\r\nnot debate the matter openly with them; but silently and privately\r\nreading over their opinions, which they gave separately in writing, (347)\r\nhe pronounced sentence from the tribunal according to his own view of the\r\ncase, as if it was the opinion of the majority.  For a long time he would\r\nnot admit the sons of freedmen into the senate; and those who had been\r\nadmitted by former princes, he excluded from all public offices.  To\r\nsupernumerary candidates he gave command in the legions, to comfort them\r\nunder the delay of their hopes.  The consulship he commonly conferred for\r\nsix months; and one of the two consuls dying a little before the first of\r\nJanuary, he substituted no one in his place; disliking what had been\r\nformerly done for Caninius Rebilus on such an occasion, who was consul\r\nfor one day only.  He allowed the triumphal honours only to those who\r\nwere of quaestorian rank, and to some of the equestrian order; and\r\nbestowed them without regard to military service.  And instead of the\r\nquaestors, whose office it properly was, he frequently ordered that the\r\naddresses, which he sent to the senate on certain occasions, should be\r\nread by the consuls.\r\n\r\nXVI.  He devised a new style of building in the city, ordering piazzas to\r\nbe erected before all houses, both in the streets and detached, to give\r\nfacilities from their terraces, in case of fire, for preventing it from\r\nspreading; and these he built at his own expense.  He likewise designed\r\nto extend the city walls as far as Ostia, and bring the sea from thence\r\nby a canal into the old city.  Many severe regulations and new orders\r\nwere made in his time.  A sumptuary law was enacted.  Public suppers were\r\nlimited to the Sportulae [576]; and victualling-houses restrained from\r\nselling any dressed victuals, except pulse and herbs, whereas before they\r\nsold all kinds of meat.  He likewise inflicted punishments on the\r\nChristians, a sort of people who held a new and impious [577]\r\nsuperstition.\r\n\r\n(348) He forbad the revels of the charioteers, who had long assumed a\r\nlicence to stroll about, and established for themselves a kind of\r\nprescriptive right to cheat and thieve, making a jest of it.  The\r\npartisans of the rival theatrical performers were banished, as well as\r\nthe actors themselves.\r\n\r\nXVII.  To prevent forgery, a method was then first invented, of having\r\nwritings bored, run through three times with a thread, and then sealed.\r\nIt was likewise provided that in wills, the two first pages, with only\r\nthe testator’s name upon them, should be presented blank to those who\r\nwere to sign them as witnesses; and that no one who wrote a will for\r\nanother, should insert any legacy for himself.  It was likewise ordained\r\nthat clients should pay their advocates a certain reasonable fee, but\r\nnothing for the court, which was to be gratuitous, the charges for it\r\nbeing paid out of the public treasury; that causes, the cognizance of\r\nwhich before belonged to the judges of the exchequer, should be\r\ntransferred to the forum, and the ordinary tribunals; and that all\r\nappeals from the judges should be made to the senate.\r\n\r\nXVIII.  He never entertained the least ambition or hope of augmenting and\r\nextending the frontiers of the empire.  On the contrary, he had thoughts\r\nof withdrawing the troops from Britain, and was only restrained from so\r\ndoing by the fear of appearing to detract from the glory of his father\r\n[578].  All (349) that he did was to reduce the kingdom of Pontus, which\r\nwas ceded to him by Polemon, and also the Alps [579], upon the death of\r\nCottius, into the form of a province.\r\n\r\nXIX.  Twice only he undertook any foreign expeditions, one to Alexandria,\r\nand the other to Achaia; but he abandoned the prosecution of the former\r\non the very day fixed for his departure, by being deterred both by ill\r\nomens, and the hazard of the voyage.  For while he was making the circuit\r\nof the temples, having seated himself in that of Vesta, when he attempted\r\nto rise, the skirt of his robe stuck fast; and he was instantly seized\r\nwith such a dimness in his eyes, that he could not see a yard before him.\r\nIn Achaia, he attempted to make a cut through the Isthmus [580]; and,\r\nhaving made a speech encouraging his pretorians to set about the work, on\r\na signal given by sound of trumpet, he first broke ground with a spade,\r\nand carried off a basket full of earth upon his shoulders.  He made\r\npreparations for an expedition to the Pass of the Caspian mountains\r\n[581]; forming a new legion out of his late levies in Italy, of men all\r\nsix feet high, which he called the phalanx of Alexander the Great.  These\r\ntransactions, in part unexceptionable, and in part highly commendable, I\r\nhave brought into one view, in order to separate them from the scandalous\r\nand criminal part of his conduct, of which I shall now give an account.\r\n\r\nXX.  Among the other liberal arts which he was taught in his youth, he\r\nwas instructed in music; and immediately after (350) his advancement to\r\nthe empire, he sent for Terpnus, a performer upon the harp [582], who\r\nflourished at that time with the highest reputation.  Sitting with him\r\nfor several days following, as he sang and played after supper, until\r\nlate at night, he began by degrees to practise upon the instrument\r\nhimself.  Nor did he omit any of those expedients which artists in music\r\nadopt, for the preservation and improvement of their voices.  He would\r\nlie upon his back with a sheet of lead upon his breast, clear his stomach\r\nand bowels by vomits and clysters, and forbear the eating of fruits, or\r\nfood prejudicial to the voice.  Encouraged by his proficiency, though his\r\nvoice was naturally neither loud nor clear, he was desirous of appearing\r\nupon the stage, frequently repeating amongst his friends a Greek proverb\r\nto this effect: “that no one had any regard for music which they never\r\nheard.”  Accordingly, he made his first public appearance at Naples; and\r\nalthough the theatre quivered with the sudden shock of an earthquake, he\r\ndid not desist, until he had finished the piece of music he had begun.\r\nHe played and sung in the same place several times, and for several days\r\ntogether; taking only now and then a little respite to refresh his voice.\r\nImpatient of retirement, it was his custom to go from the bath to the\r\ntheatre; and after dining in the orchestra, amidst a crowded assembly of\r\nthe people, he promised them in Greek [583], “that after he had drank a\r\nlittle, he would give them a tune which would make their ears tingle.”\r\n Being highly pleased with the songs that were sung in his praise by some\r\nAlexandrians belonging to the fleet just arrived at Naples [584], he sent\r\nfor more of the like singers from Alexandria.  At the same time, he chose\r\nyoung men of the equestrian order, and above five thousand robust young\r\nfellows from the common people, on purpose to learn various kinds of\r\napplause, called bombi, imbrices, and testae [585], which they were to\r\npractise in his favour, whenever he performed.  They were (351) divided\r\ninto several parties, and were remarkable for their fine heads of hair,\r\nand were extremely well dressed, with rings upon their left hands.  The\r\nleaders of these bands had salaries of forty thousand sesterces allowed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nXXI.  At Rome also, being extremely proud of his singing, he ordered the\r\ngames called Neronia to be celebrated before the time fixed for their\r\nreturn.  All now becoming importunate to hear “his heavenly voice,” he\r\ninformed them, “that he would gratify those who desired it at the\r\ngardens.”  But the soldiers then on guard seconding the voice of the\r\npeople, he promised to comply with their request immediately, and with\r\nall his heart.  He instantly ordered his name to be entered upon the list\r\nof musicians who proposed to contend, and having thrown his lot into the\r\nurn among the rest, took his turn, and entered, attended by the prefects\r\nof the pretorian cohorts bearing his harp, and followed by the military\r\ntribunes, and several of his intimate friends.  After he had taken his\r\nstation, and made the usual prelude, he commanded Cluvius Rufus, a man of\r\nconsular rank, to proclaim in the theatre, that he intended to sing the\r\nstory of Niobe.  This he accordingly did, and continued it until nearly\r\nten o’clock, but deferred the disposal of the crown, and the remaining\r\npart of the solemnity, until the next year; that he might have more\r\nfrequent opportunities of performing.  But that being too long, he could\r\nnot refrain from often appearing as a public performer during the\r\ninterval.  He made no scruple of exhibiting on the stage, even in the\r\nspectacles presented to the people by private persons, and was offered by\r\none of the praetors, no less than a million of sesterces for his\r\nservices.  He likewise sang tragedies in a mask; the visors of the heroes\r\nand gods, as also of the heroines and goddesses, being formed into a\r\nresemblance of his own face, and that of any woman he was in love with.\r\nAmongst the rest, he sung “Canace in Labour,” [586] “Orestes the Murderer\r\nof his Mother,” “Oedipus (352) Blinded,” and “Hercules Mad.”  In the last\r\ntragedy, it is said that a young sentinel, posted at the entrance of the\r\nstage, seeing him in a prison dress and bound with fetters, as the fable\r\nof the play required, ran to his assistance.\r\n\r\nXXII.  He had from his childhood an extravagant passion for horses; and\r\nhis constant talk was of the Circensian races, notwithstanding it was\r\nprohibited him.  Lamenting once, among his fellow-pupils, the case of a\r\ncharioteer of the green party, who was dragged round the circus at the\r\ntail of his chariot, and being reprimanded by his tutor for it, he\r\npretended that he was talking of Hector.  In the beginning of his reign,\r\nhe used to amuse himself daily with chariots drawn by four horses, made\r\nof ivory, upon a table.  He attended at all the lesser exhibitions in the\r\ncircus, at first privately, but at last openly; so that nobody ever\r\ndoubted of his presence on any particular day.  Nor did he conceal his\r\ndesire to have the number of the prizes doubled; so that the races being\r\nincreased accordingly, the diversion continued until a late hour; the\r\nleaders of parties refusing now to bring out their companies for any time\r\nless than the whole day.  Upon this, he took a fancy for driving the\r\nchariot himself, and that even publicly.  Having made his first\r\nexperiment in the gardens, amidst crowds of slaves and other rabble, he\r\nat length performed in the view of all the people, in the Circus Maximus,\r\nwhilst one of his freedmen dropped the napkin in the place where the\r\nmagistrates used to give the signal.  Not satisfied with exhibiting\r\nvarious specimens of his skill in those arts at Rome, he went over to\r\nAchaia, as has been already said, principally for this purpose.  The\r\nseveral cities, in which solemn trials of musical skill used to be\r\npublicly held, had resolved to send him the crowns belonging to those who\r\nbore away the prize.  These he accepted so graciously, that he not only\r\ngave the deputies who brought them an immediate audience, but even\r\ninvited them to his table.  Being requested by some of them to sing at\r\nsupper, and prodigiously applauded, he said, “the Greeks were the only\r\npeople who has an ear for music, and were the only good judges of him and\r\nhis attainments.”  Without delay he commenced his journey, and on his\r\narrival at Cassiope [587], (352) exhibited his first musical performance\r\nbefore the altar of Jupiter Cassius.\r\n\r\nXXIII.  He afterwards appeared at the celebration of all public games in\r\nGreece: for such as fell in different years, he brought within the\r\ncompass of one, and some he ordered to be celebrated a second time in the\r\nsame year.  At Olympia, likewise, contrary to custom, he appointed a\r\npublic performance in music: and that he might meet with no interruption\r\nin this employment, when he was informed by his freedman Helius, that\r\naffairs at Rome required his presence, he wrote to him in these words:\r\n“Though now all your hopes and wishes are for my speedy return, yet you\r\nought rather to advise and hope that I may come back with a character\r\nworthy of Nero.”  During the time of his musical performance, nobody was\r\nallowed to stir out of the theatre upon any account, however necessary;\r\ninsomuch, that it is said some women with child were delivered there.\r\nMany of the spectators being quite wearied with hearing and applauding\r\nhim, because the town gates were shut, slipped privately over the walls;\r\nor counterfeiting themselves dead, were carried out for their funeral.\r\nWith what extreme anxiety he engaged in these contests, with what keen\r\ndesire to bear away the prize, and with how much awe of the judges, is\r\nscarcely to be believed.  As if his adversaries had been on a level with\r\nhimself, he would watch them narrowly, defame them privately, and\r\nsometimes, upon meeting them, rail at them in very scurrilous language;\r\nor bribe them, if they were better performers than himself.  He always\r\naddressed the judges with the most profound reverence before he began,\r\ntelling them, “he had done all things that were necessary, by way of\r\npreparation, but that the issue of the approaching trial was in the hand\r\nof fortune; and that they, as wise and skilful men, ought to exclude from\r\ntheir judgment things merely accidental.”  Upon their encouraging him to\r\nhave a good heart, he went off with more assurance, but not entirely free\r\nfrom anxiety; interpreting the silence and modesty of some of them into\r\nsourness and ill-nature, and saying that he was suspicious of them.\r\n\r\nXXIV.  In these contests, he adhered so strictly to the rules, (354) that\r\nhe never durst spit, nor wipe the sweat from his forehead in any other\r\nway than with his sleeve.  Having, in the performance of a tragedy,\r\ndropped his sceptre, and not quickly recovering it, he was in a great\r\nfright, lest he should be set aside for the miscarriage, and could not\r\nregain his assurance, until an actor who stood by swore he was certain it\r\nhad not been observed in the midst of the acclamations and exultations of\r\nthe people.  When the prize was adjudged to him, he always proclaimed it\r\nhimself; and even entered the lists with the heralds.  That no memory or\r\nthe least monument might remain of any other victor in the sacred Grecian\r\ngames, he ordered all their statues and pictures to be pulled down,\r\ndragged away with hooks, and thrown into the common sewers.  He drove the\r\nchariot with various numbers of horses, and at the Olympic games with no\r\nfewer than ten; though, in a poem of his, he had reflected upon\r\nMithridates for that innovation.  Being thrown out of his chariot, he was\r\nagain replaced, but could not retain his seat, and was obliged to give\r\nup, before he reached the goal, but was crowned notwithstanding.  On his\r\ndeparture, he declared the whole province a free country, and conferred\r\nupon the judges in the several games the freedom of Rome, with large sums\r\nof money.  All these favours he proclaimed himself with his own voice,\r\nfrom the middle of the Stadium, during the solemnity of the Isthmian\r\ngames.\r\n\r\nXXV.  On his return from Greece, arriving at Naples, because he had\r\ncommenced his career as a public performer in that city, he made his\r\nentrance in a chariot drawn by white horses through a breach in the\r\ncity-wall, according to the practice of those who were victorious in the\r\nsacred Grecian games.  In the same manner he entered Antium, Alba, and\r\nRome.  He made his entry into the city riding in the same chariot in\r\nwhich Augustus had triumphed, in a purple tunic, and a cloak embroidered\r\nwith golden stars, having on his head the crown won at Olympia, and in\r\nhis right hand that which was given him at the Parthian games: the rest\r\nbeing carried in a procession before him, with inscriptions denoting the\r\nplaces where they had been won, from whom, and in what plays or musical\r\nperformances; whilst a train followed him with loud acclamations, crying\r\nout, that “they (355) were the emperor’s attendants, and the soldiers of\r\nhis triumph.”  Having then caused an arch of the Circus Maximus [588] to\r\nbe taken down, he passed through the breach, as also through the Velabrum\r\n[589] and the forum, to the Palatine hill and the temple of Apollo.\r\nEverywhere as he marched along, victims were slain, whilst the streets\r\nwere strewed with saffron, and birds, chaplets, and sweetmeats scattered\r\nabroad.  He suspended the sacred crowns in his chamber, about his beds,\r\nand caused statues of himself to be erected in the attire of a harper,\r\nand had his likeness stamped upon the coin in the same dress.  After this\r\nperiod, he was so far from abating any thing of his application to music,\r\nthat, for the preservation of his voice, he never addressed the soldiers\r\nbut by messages, or with some person to deliver his speeches for him,\r\nwhen he thought fit to make his appearance amongst them.  Nor did he ever\r\ndo any thing either in jest or earnest, without a voice-master standing\r\nby him to caution him against overstraining his vocal organs, and to\r\napply a handkerchief to his mouth when he did.  He offered his\r\nfriendship, or avowed (356) open enmity to many, according as they were\r\nlavish or sparing in giving him their applause.\r\n\r\nXXVI.  Petulancy, lewdness, luxury, avarice, and cruelty, he practised at\r\nfirst with reserve and in private, as if prompted to them only by the\r\nfolly of youth; but, even then, the world was of opinion that they were\r\nthe faults of his nature, and not of his age.  After it was dark, he used\r\nto enter the taverns disguised in a cap or a wig, and ramble about the\r\nstreets in sport, which was not void of mischief.  He used to beat those\r\nhe met coming home from supper; and, if they made any resistance, would\r\nwound them, and throw them into the common sewer.  He broke open and\r\nrobbed shops; establishing an auction at home for selling his booty.  In\r\nthe scuffles which took place on those occasions, he often ran the hazard\r\nof losing his eyes, and even his life; being beaten almost to death by a\r\nsenator, for handling his wife indecently.  After this adventure, he\r\nnever again ventured abroad at that time of night, without some tribunes\r\nfollowing him at a little distance.  In the day-time he would be carried\r\nto the theatre incognito in a litter, placing himself upon the upper part\r\nof the proscenium, where he not only witnessed the quarrels which arose\r\non account of the performances, but also encouraged them.  When they came\r\nto blows, and stones and pieces of broken benches began to fly about, he\r\nthrew them plentifully amongst the people, and once even broke a\r\npraetor’s head.\r\n\r\nXXVII.  His vices gaining strength by degrees, he laid aside his jocular\r\namusements, and all disguise; breaking out into enormous crimes, without\r\nthe least attempt to conceal them.  His revels were prolonged from\r\nmid-day to midnight, while he was frequently refreshed by warm baths, and,\r\nin the summer time, by such as were cooled with snow.  He often supped in\r\npublic, in the Naumachia, with the sluices shut, or in the Campus Martius,\r\nor the Circus Maximus, being waited upon at table by common prostitutes of\r\nthe town, and Syrian strumpets and glee-girls.  As often as he went down\r\nthe Tiber to Ostia, or coasted through the gulf of Baiae, booths furnished\r\nas brothels and eating-houses, were erected along the shore and river\r\nbanks; before which stood matrons, who, like bawds and hostesses, allured\r\nhim to land.  It was also his custom to invite (357) himself to supper\r\nwith his friends; at one of which was expended no less than four millions\r\nof sesterces in chaplets, and at another something more in roses.\r\n\r\nXXVIII.  Besides the abuse of free-born lads, and the debauch of married\r\nwomen, he committed a rape upon Rubria, a Vestal Virgin.  He was upon the\r\npoint of marrying Acte [590], his freedwoman, having suborned some men of\r\nconsular rank to swear that she was of royal descent.  He gelded the boy\r\nSporus, and endeavoured to transform him into a woman.  He even went so\r\nfar as to marry him, with all the usual formalities of a marriage\r\nsettlement, the rose-coloured nuptial veil, and a numerous company at the\r\nwedding.  When the ceremony was over, he had him conducted like a bride\r\nto his own house, and treated him as his wife [591].  It was jocularly\r\nobserved by some person, “that it would have been well for mankind, had\r\nsuch a wife fallen to the lot of his father Domitius.”  This Sporus he\r\ncarried about with him in a litter round the solemn assemblies and fairs\r\nof Greece, and afterwards at Rome through the Sigillaria [592], dressed\r\nin the rich attire of an empress; kissing him from time to time as they\r\nrode together.  That he entertained an incestuous passion for his mother\r\n[593], but was deterred by her enemies, for fear that this haughty and\r\noverbearing woman should, by her compliance, get him entirely into her\r\npower, and govern in every thing, was universally believed; especially\r\nafter he had introduced amongst his concubines a strumpet, who was\r\nreported to have a strong resemblance to Agrippina [594].--------\r\n\r\nXXIX.  He prostituted his own chastity to such a degree, that (358) after\r\nhe had defiled every part of his person with some unnatural pollution, he\r\nat last invented an extraordinary kind of diversion; which was, to be let\r\nout of a den in the arena, covered with the skin of a wild beast, and\r\nthen assail with violence the private parts both of men and women, while\r\nthey were bound to stakes.  After he had vented his furious passion upon\r\nthem, he finished the play in the embraces of his freedman Doryphorus\r\n[595], to whom he was married in the same way that Sporus had been\r\nmarried to himself; imitating the cries and shrieks of young virgins,\r\nwhen they are ravished.  I have been informed from numerous sources, that\r\nhe firmly believed, no man in the world to be chaste, or any part of his\r\nperson undefiled; but that most men concealed that vice, and were cunning\r\nenough to keep it secret.  To those, therefore, who frankly owned their\r\nunnatural lewdness, he forgave all other crimes.\r\n\r\nXXX.  He thought there was no other use of riches and money than to\r\nsquander them away profusely; regarding all those as sordid wretches who\r\nkept their expenses within due bounds; and extolling those as truly noble\r\nand generous souls, who lavished away and wasted all they possessed.  He\r\npraised and admired his uncle Caius [596], upon no account more, than for\r\nsquandering in a short time the vast treasure left him by Tiberius.\r\nAccordingly, he was himself extravagant and profuse, beyond all bounds.\r\nHe spent upon Tiridates eight hundred thousand sesterces a day, a sum\r\nalmost incredible; and at his departure, presented him with upwards of a\r\nmillion [597].  He likewise bestowed upon Menecrates the harper, and\r\nSpicillus a gladiator, the estates and houses of men who had received the\r\nhonour of a triumph.  He enriched the usurer Cercopithecus Panerotes with\r\nestates both in town and country; and gave him a funeral, in pomp and\r\nmagnificence little inferior to that of princes.  He never wore the same\r\ngarment twice.  He (359) has been known to stake four hundred thousand\r\nsesterces on a throw of the dice.  It was his custom to fish with a\r\ngolden net, drawn by silken cords of purple and scarlet.  It is said,\r\nthat he never travelled with less than a thousand baggage-carts; the\r\nmules being all shod with silver, and the drivers dressed in scarlet\r\njackets of the finest Canusian cloth [598], with a numerous train of\r\nfootmen, and troops of Mazacans [599], with bracelets on their arms, and\r\nmounted upon horses in splendid trappings.\r\n\r\nXXXI.  In nothing was he more prodigal than in his buildings.  He\r\ncompleted his palace by continuing it from the Palatine to the Esquiline\r\nhill, calling the building at first only “The Passage,” but, after it was\r\nburnt down and rebuilt, “The Golden House.” [600]  Of its dimensions and\r\nfurniture, it may be sufficient to say thus much: the porch was so high\r\nthat there stood in it a colossal statue of himself a hundred and twenty\r\nfeet in height; and the space included in it was so ample, that it had\r\ntriple porticos a mile in length, and a lake like a sea, surrounded with\r\nbuildings which had the appearance of a city.  Within its area were corn\r\nfields, vineyards, pastures, and woods, containing a vast number of\r\nanimals of various kinds, both wild and tame.  In other parts it was\r\nentirely over-laid with gold, and adorned with jewels and mother of\r\npearl.  The supper rooms were vaulted, and compartments of the ceilings,\r\ninlaid with ivory, were made to revolve, and scatter flowers; while they\r\ncontained pipes which (360) shed unguents upon the guests.  The chief\r\nbanqueting room was circular, and revolved perpetually, night and day, in\r\nimitation of the motion of the celestial bodies.  The baths were supplied\r\nwith water from the sea and the Albula.  Upon the dedication of this\r\nmagnificent house after it was finished, all he said in approval of it\r\nwas, “that he had now a dwelling fit for a man.”  He commenced making a\r\npond for the reception of all the hot streams from Baiae, which he\r\ndesigned to have continued from Misenum to the Avernian lake, in a\r\nconduit, enclosed in galleries; and also a canal from Avernum to Ostia,\r\nthat ships might pass from one to the other, without a sea voyage.  The\r\nlength of the proposed canal was one hundred and sixty miles; and it was\r\nintended to be of breadth sufficient to permit ships with five banks of\r\noars to pass each other.  For the execution of these designs, he ordered\r\nall prisoners, in every part of the empire, to be brought to Italy; and\r\nthat even those who were convicted of the most heinous crimes, in lieu of\r\nany other sentence, should be condemned to work at them.  He was\r\nencouraged to all this wild and enormous profusion, not only by the great\r\nrevenue of the empire, but by the sudden hopes given him of an immense\r\nhidden treasure, which queen Dido, upon her flight from Tyre, had brought\r\nwith her to Africa.  This, a Roman knight pretended to assure him, upon\r\ngood grounds, was still hid there in some deep caverns, and might with a\r\nlittle labour be recovered.\r\n\r\nXXXII.  But being disappointed in his expectations of this resource, and\r\nreduced to such difficulties, for want of money, that he was obliged to\r\ndefer paying his troops, and the rewards due to the veterans; he resolved\r\nupon supplying his necessities by means of false accusations and plunder.\r\nIn the first place, he ordered, that if any freedman, without sufficient\r\nreason, bore the name of the family to which he belonged; the half,\r\ninstead of three fourths, of his estate should be brought into the\r\nexchequer at his decease: also that the estates of all such persons as\r\nhad not in their wills been mindful of their prince, should be\r\nconfiscated; and that the lawyers who had drawn or dictated such wills,\r\nshould be liable to a fine.  He ordained likewise, that all words and\r\nactions, upon which any informer could ground a prosecution, should be\r\ndeemed treason.  He demanded an equivalent for the crowns which the\r\ncities of (361) Greece had at any time offered him in the solemn games.\r\nHaving forbad any one to use the colours of amethyst and Tyrian purple,\r\nhe privately sent a person to sell a few ounces of them upon the day of\r\nthe Nundinae, and then shut up all the merchants’ shops, on the pretext\r\nthat his edict had been violated.  It is said, that, as he was playing\r\nand singing in the theatre, observing a married lady dressed in the\r\npurple which he had prohibited, he pointed her out to his procurators;\r\nupon which she was immediately dragged out of her seat, and not only\r\nstripped of her clothes, but her property.  He never nominated a person\r\nto any office without saying to him, “You know what I want; and let us\r\ntake care that nobody has any thing he can call his own.”  At last he\r\nrifled many temples of the rich offerings with which they were stored,\r\nand melted down all the gold and silver statues, and amongst them those\r\nof the penates [601], which Galba afterwards restored.\r\n\r\nXXXIII.  He began the practice of parricide and murder with Claudius\r\nhimself; for although he was not the contriver of his death, he was privy\r\nto the plot.  Nor did he make any secret of it; but used afterwards to\r\ncommend, in a Greek proverb, mushrooms as food fit for the gods, because\r\nClaudius had been poisoned with them.  He traduced his memory both by\r\nword and deed in the grossest manner; one while charging him with folly,\r\nanother while with cruelty.  For he used to say by way of jest, that he\r\nhad ceased morari [602] amongst men, pronouncing the first syllable long;\r\nand treated as null many of his decrees and ordinances, as made by a\r\ndoting old blockhead.  He enclosed the place where his body was burnt\r\nwith only a low wall of rough masonry.  He attempted to poison (362)\r\nBritannicus, as much out of envy because he had a sweeter voice, as from\r\napprehension of what might ensue from the respect which the people\r\nentertained for his father’s memory.  He employed for this purpose a\r\nwoman named Locusta, who had been a witness against some persons guilty\r\nof like practices.  But the poison she gave him, working more slowly than\r\nhe expected, and only causing a purge, he sent for the woman, and beat\r\nher with his own hand, charging her with administering an antidote\r\ninstead of poison; and upon her alleging in excuse, that she had given\r\nBritannicus but a gentle mixture in order to prevent suspicion, “Think\r\nyou,” said he, “that I am afraid of the Julian law;” and obliged her to\r\nprepare, in his own chamber and before his eyes, as quick and strong a\r\ndose as possible.  This he tried upon a kid: but the animal lingering for\r\nfive hours before it expired, he ordered her to go to work again; and\r\nwhen she had done, he gave the poison to a pig, which dying immediately,\r\nhe commanded the potion to be brought into the eating-room and given to\r\nBritannicus, while he was at supper with him.  The prince had no sooner\r\ntasted it than he sunk on the floor, Nero meanwhile, pretending to the\r\nguests, that it was only a fit of the falling sickness, to which, he\r\nsaid, he was subject.  He buried him the following day, in a mean and\r\nhurried way, during violent storms of rain.  He gave Locusta a pardon,\r\nand rewarded her with a great estate in land, placing some disciples with\r\nher, to be instructed in her trade.\r\n\r\nXXXIV.  His mother being used to make strict inquiry into what he said or\r\ndid, and to reprimand him with the freedom of a parent, he was so much\r\noffended, that he endeavoured to expose her to public resentment, by\r\nfrequently pretending a resolution to quit the government, and retire to\r\nRhodes.  Soon afterwards, he deprived her of all honour and power, took\r\nfrom her the guard of Roman and German soldiers, banished her from the\r\npalace and from his society, and persecuted her in every way he could\r\ncontrive; employing persons to harass her when at Rome with law-suits,\r\nand to disturb her in her retirement from town with the most scurrilous\r\nand abusive language, following her about by land and sea.  But being\r\nterrified with her menaces and violent spirit, he resolved upon her\r\ndestruction, and thrice attempted it by poison.  Finding, however, (363)\r\nthat she had previously secured herself by antidotes, he contrived\r\nmachinery, by which the floor over her bed-chamber might be made to fall\r\nupon her while she was asleep in the night.  This design miscarrying\r\nlikewise, through the little caution used by those who were in the\r\nsecret, his next stratagem was to construct a ship which could be easily\r\nshivered, in hopes of destroying her either by drowning, or by the deck\r\nabove her cabin crushing her in its fall.  Accordingly, under colour of a\r\npretended reconciliation, he wrote her an extremely affectionate letter,\r\ninviting her to Baiae, to celebrate with him the festival of Minerva.  He\r\nhad given private orders to the captains of the galleys which were to\r\nattend her, to shatter to pieces the ship in which she had come, by\r\nfalling foul of it, but in such manner that it might appear to be done\r\naccidentally.  He prolonged the entertainment, for the more convenient\r\nopportunity of executing the plot in the night; and at her return for\r\nBauli [603], instead of the old ship which had conveyed her to Baiae, he\r\noffered that which he had contrived for her destruction.  He attended her\r\nto the vessel in a very cheerful mood, and, at parting with her, kissed\r\nher breasts; after which he sat up very late in the night, waiting with\r\ngreat anxiety to learn the issue of his project.  But receiving\r\ninformation that every thing had fallen out contrary to his wish, and\r\nthat she had saved herself by swimming,--not knowing what course to take,\r\nupon her freedman, Lucius Agerinus bringing word, with great joy, that\r\nshe was safe and well, he privately dropped a poniard by him.  He then\r\ncommanded the freedman to be seized and put in chains, under pretence of\r\nhis having been employed by his mother to assassinate him; at the same\r\ntime ordering her to be put to death, and giving out, that, to avoid\r\npunishment for her intended crime, she had laid violent hands upon\r\nherself.  Other circumstances, still more horrible, are related on good\r\nauthority; as that he went to view her corpse, and handling her limbs,\r\npointed out some blemishes, and commended other points; and that, growing\r\nthirsty during the survey, he called for drink.  Yet he was never\r\nafterwards able to bear the stings of his own conscience for this\r\natrocious act, although encouraged by the congratulatory addresses of the\r\narmy, the senate, and people.  He frequently affirmed that he was haunted\r\nby his mother’s ghost, and persecuted with the whips (364) and burning\r\ntorches of the Furies.  Nay, he attempted by magical rites to bring up\r\nher ghost from below, and soften her rage against him.  When he was in\r\nGreece, he durst not attend the celebration of the Eleusinian mysteries,\r\nat the initiation of which, impious and wicked persons are warned by the\r\nvoice of the herald from approaching the rites [604].  Besides the murder\r\nof his mother, he had been guilty of that of his aunt; for, being obliged\r\nto keep her bed in consequence of a complaint in her bowels, he paid her\r\na visit, and she, being then advanced in years, stroking his downy chin,\r\nin the tenderness of affection, said to him: “May I but live to see the\r\nday when this is shaved for the first time [605], and I shall then die\r\ncontented.”  He turned, however, to those about him, made a jest of it,\r\nsaying, that he would have his beard immediately taken off, and ordered\r\nthe physicians to give her more violent purgatives.  He seized upon her\r\nestate before she had expired; suppressing her will, that he might enjoy\r\nthe whole himself.\r\n\r\nXXXV.  He had, besides Octavia, two other wives: Poppaea Sabina, whose\r\nfather had borne the office of quaestor, and who had been married\r\nbefore to a Roman knight: and, after her, Statilia Messalina,\r\ngreat-grand-daughter of Taurus [606] who was twice consul, and received\r\nthe honour of a triumph.  To obtain possession of her, he put to death her\r\nhusband, Atticus Vestinus, who was then consul.  He soon became disgusted\r\nwith Octavia, and ceased from having any intercourse with her; and being\r\ncensured by his friends for it, he replied, “She ought to be satisfied\r\nwith having the rank and appendages of his wife.”  Soon afterwards, he\r\nmade several attempts, but in vain, to strangle her, and then divorced her\r\nfor barrenness.  But the people, disapproving of the divorce, and making\r\nsevere comments upon it, he also banished her [607].  At last he (365) put\r\nher to death, upon a charge of adultery, so impudent and false, that, when\r\nall those who were put to the torture positively denied their knowledge of\r\nit, he suborned his pedagogue, Anicetus, to affirm, that he had secretly\r\nintrigued with and debauched her.  He married Poppaea twelve days after\r\nthe divorce of Octavia [608], and entertained a great affection for her;\r\nbut, nevertheless, killed her with a kick which he gave her when she was\r\nbig with child, and in bad health, only because she found fault with him\r\nfor returning late from driving his chariot.  He had by her a daughter,\r\nClaudia Augusta, who died an infant.  There was no person at all connected\r\nwith him who escaped his deadly and unjust cruelty.  Under pretence of her\r\nbeing engaged in a plot against him, he put to death Antonia, Claudius’s\r\ndaughter, who refused to marry him after the death of Poppaea.  In the\r\nsame way, he destroyed all who were allied to him either by blood or\r\nmarriage; amongst whom was young Aulus Plautinus.  He first compelled him\r\nto submit to his unnatural lust, and then ordered him to be executed,\r\ncrying out, “Let my mother bestow her kisses on my successor thus\r\ndefiled;” pretending that he had been his mothers paramour, and by her\r\nencouraged to aspire to the empire.  His step-son, Rufinus Crispinus,\r\nPoppaea’s son, though a minor, he ordered to be drowned in the sea, while\r\nhe was fishing, by his own slaves, because he was reported to act\r\nfrequently amongst his play-fellows the part of a general or an emperor.\r\nHe banished Tuscus, his nurse’s son, for presuming, when he was procurator\r\nof Egypt, to wash in the baths which had been constructed in expectation\r\nof his own coming.  Seneca, his preceptor, he forced to kill himself\r\n[609], though, upon his desiring leave to retire, and offering to\r\nsurrender his estate, he solemnly swore, “that there was no foundation for\r\nhis suspicions, and that he would perish himself sooner than hurt him.”\r\n Having promised Burrhus, the pretorian prefect, a remedy for a swelling in\r\nhis throat, he sent him poison.  Some old rich freedmen of Claudius, who\r\nhad formerly not only promoted (366) his adoption, but were also\r\ninstrumental to his advancement to the empire, and had been his governors,\r\nhe took off by poison given them in their meat or drink.\r\n\r\nXXXVI.  Nor did he proceed with less cruelty against those who were not\r\nof his family.  A blazing star, which is vulgarly supposed to portend\r\ndestruction to kings and princes, appeared above the horizon several\r\nnights successively [610].  He felt great anxiety on account of this\r\nphenomenon, and being informed by one Babilus, an astrologer, that\r\nprinces were used to expiate such omens by the sacrifice of illustrious\r\npersons, and so avert the danger foreboded to their own persons, by\r\nbringing it on the heads of their chief men, he resolved on the\r\ndestruction of the principal nobility in Rome.  He was the more\r\nencouraged to this, because he had some plausible pretence for carrying\r\nit into execution, from the discovery of two conspiracies against him;\r\nthe former and more dangerous of which was that formed by Piso [611], and\r\ndiscovered at Rome; the other was that of Vinicius [612], at Beneventum.\r\nThe conspirators were brought to their trials loaded with triple fetters.\r\nSome ingenuously confessed the charge; others avowed that they thought\r\nthe design against his life an act of favour for which he was obliged to\r\nthem, as it was impossible in any other way than by death to relieve a\r\nperson rendered infamous by crimes of the greatest enormity.  The\r\nchildren of those who had been condemned, were banished the city, and\r\nafterwards either poisoned or starved to death.  It is asserted that some\r\nof them, with their tutors, and the slaves who carried their satchels,\r\nwere all poisoned together at one dinner; and others not suffered to seek\r\ntheir daily bread.\r\n\r\nXXXVII.  From this period he butchered, without distinction or quarter,\r\nall whom his caprice suggested as objects for his cruelty; and upon the\r\nmost frivolous pretences.  To mention only a few: Salvidienus Orfitus was\r\naccused of letting (367) out three taverns attached to his house in the\r\nForum to some cities for the use of their deputies at Rome.  The charge\r\nagainst Cassius Longinus, a lawyer who had lost his sight, was, that he\r\nkept amongst the busts of his ancestors that of Caius Cassius, who was\r\nconcerned in the death of Julius Caesar.  The only charge objected\r\nagainst Paetus Thrasea was, that he had a melancholy cast of features,\r\nand looked like a schoolmaster.  He allowed but one hour to those whom he\r\nobliged to kill themselves; and, to prevent delay, he sent them\r\nphysicians “to cure them immediately, if they lingered beyond that time;”\r\n for so he called bleeding them to death.  There was at that time an\r\nEgyptian of a most voracious appetite, who would digest raw flesh, or any\r\nthing else that was given him.  It was credibly reported, that the\r\nemperor was extremely desirous of furnishing him with living men to tear\r\nand devour.  Being elated with his great success in the perpetration of\r\ncrimes, he declared, “that no prince before himself ever knew the extent\r\nof his power.”  He threw out strong intimations that he would not even\r\nspare the senators who survived, but would entirely extirpate that order,\r\nand put the provinces and armies into the hands of the Roman knights and\r\nhis own freedmen.  It is certain that he never gave or vouchsafed to\r\nallow any one the customary kiss, either on entering or departing, or\r\neven returned a salute.  And at the inauguration of a work, the cut\r\nthrough the Isthmus [613], he, with a loud voice, amidst the assembled\r\nmultitude, uttered a prayer, that “the undertaking might prove fortunate\r\nfor himself and the Roman people,” without taking the smallest notice of\r\nthe senate.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII.  He spared, moreover, neither the people of Rome, nor the\r\ncapital of his country.  Somebody in conversation saying--\r\n\r\n    Emou thanontos gaia michthaeto pyri\r\n    When I am dead let fire devour the world--\r\n\r\n“Nay,” said he, “let it be while I am living” [emou xontos].  And he\r\nacted accordingly: for, pretending to be disgusted with the old\r\nbuildings, and the narrow and winding streets, he set the city on fire so\r\nopenly, that many of consular rank caught his own household servants on\r\ntheir property with tow, and (368) torches in their hands, but durst not\r\nmeddle with them.  There being near his Golden House some granaries, the\r\nsite of which he exceedingly coveted, they were battered as if with\r\nmachines of war, and set on fire, the walls being built of stone.  During\r\nsix days and seven nights this terrible devastation continued, the people\r\nbeing obliged to fly to the tombs and monuments for lodging and shelter.\r\nMeanwhile, a vast number of stately buildings, the houses of generals\r\ncelebrated in former times, and even then still decorated with the spoils\r\nof war, were laid in ashes; as well as the temples of the gods, which had\r\nbeen vowed and dedicated by the kings of Rome, and afterwards in the\r\nPunic and Gallic wars: in short, everything that was remarkable and\r\nworthy to be seen which time had spared [614].  This fire he beheld from\r\na tower in the house of Mecaenas, and “being greatly delighted,” as he\r\nsaid, “with the beautiful effects of the conflagration,” he sung a poem\r\non the ruin of Troy, in the tragic dress he used on the stage.  To turn\r\nthis calamity to his own advantage by plunder and rapine, he promised to\r\nremove the bodies of those who had perished in the fire, and clear the\r\nrubbish at his own expense; suffering no one to meddle with the remains\r\nof their property.  But he not only received, but exacted contributions\r\non account of the loss, until he had exhausted the means both of the\r\nprovinces and private persons.\r\n\r\nXXXIX.  To these terrible and shameful calamities brought upon the people\r\nby their prince, were added some proceeding from misfortune.  Such were a\r\npestilence, by which, within the space of one autumn, there died no less\r\nthan thirty thousand persons, as appeared from the registers in the\r\ntemple of Libitina; a great disaster in Britain [615], where two of the\r\nprincipal towns belonging to the Romans were plundered; and a (369)\r\ndreadful havoc made both amongst our troops and allies; a shameful\r\ndiscomfiture of the army of the East; where, in Armenia, the legions were\r\nobliged to pass under the yoke, and it was with great difficulty that\r\nSyria was retained.  Amidst all these disasters, it was strange, and,\r\nindeed, particularly remarkable, that he bore nothing more patiently than\r\nthe scurrilous language and railing abuse which was in every one’s mouth;\r\ntreating no class of persons with more gentleness, than those who\r\nassailed him with invective and lampoons.  Many things of that kind were\r\nposted up about the city, or otherwise published, both in Greek and\r\nLatin: such as these,\r\n\r\n    Neron, Orestaes, Alkmaion, maetroktonai.\r\n    Neonymphon [616] Neron, idian maeter apekteinen.\r\n\r\n      Orestes and Alcaeon--Nero too,\r\n      The lustful Nero, worst of all the crew,\r\n      Fresh from his bridal--their own mothers slew.\r\n\r\n    Quis neget Aeneae magna de stirpe Neronem?\r\n      Sustulit hic matrem: sustulit [617] ille patrem.\r\n\r\n      Sprung from Aeneas, pious, wise and great,\r\n      Who says that Nero is degenerate?\r\n      Safe through the flames, one bore his sire; the other,\r\n      To save himself, took off his loving mother.\r\n\r\n    Dum tendit citharam noster, dum cornua Parthus,\r\n      Noster erit Paean, ille Ekataebeletaes.\r\n\r\n      His lyre to harmony our Nero strings;\r\n      His arrows o’er the plain the Parthian wings:\r\n      Ours call the tuneful Paean,--famed in war,\r\n      The other Phoebus name, the god who shoots afar. [618]\r\n\r\n    Roma domus fiet: Vejos migrate, Quirites,\r\n      Si non et Vejos occupat ista domus.\r\n\r\n      All Rome will be one house: to Veii fly,\r\n      Should it not stretch to Veii, by and by. [619]\r\n\r\n(370) But he neither made any inquiry after the authors, nor when\r\ninformation was laid before the senate against some of them, would he\r\nallow a severe sentence to be passed.  Isidorus, the Cynic philosopher,\r\nsaid to him aloud, as he was passing along the streets, “You sing the\r\nmisfortunes of Nauplius well, but behave badly yourself.”  And Datus, a\r\ncomic actor, when repeating these words in the piece, “Farewell, father!\r\nFarewell mother!” mimicked the gestures of persons drinking and swimming,\r\nsignificantly alluding to the deaths of Claudius and Agrippina: and on\r\nuttering the last clause,\r\n\r\n    Orcus vobis ducit pedes;\r\n    You stand this moment on the brink of Orcus;\r\n\r\nhe plainly intimated his application of it to the precarious position of\r\nthe senate.  Yet Nero only banished the player and philosopher from the\r\ncity and Italy; either because he was insensible to shame, or from\r\napprehension that if he discovered his vexation, still keener things\r\nmight be said of him.\r\n\r\nXL.  The world, after tolerating such an emperor for little less than\r\nfourteen years, at length forsook him; the Gauls, headed by Julius\r\nVindex, who at that time governed the province as pro-praetor, being the\r\nfirst to revolt.  Nero had been formerly told by astrologers, that it\r\nwould be his fortune to be at last deserted by all the world; and this\r\noccasioned that celebrated saying of his, “An artist can live in any\r\ncountry;” by which he meant to offer as an excuse for his practice of\r\nmusic, that it was not only his amusement as a prince, but might be his\r\nsupport when reduced to a private station.  Yet some of the astrologers\r\npromised him, in his forlorn state, the rule of the East, and some in\r\nexpress words the kingdom of Jerusalem.  But the greater part of them\r\nflattered him with assurances of his being restored to his former\r\nfortune.  And being most inclined to believe the latter prediction, upon\r\nlosing Britain and Armenia, he imagined he had run through all the\r\nmisfortunes which the fates had decreed him.  But when, upon consulting\r\nthe oracle of Apollo at Delphi, he was advised to beware of the\r\nseventy-third year, as if he were not to die till then, never thinking of\r\nGalba’s age, he conceived such hopes, not only of living to advanced\r\nyears, but of constant and singular good fortune, that having lost some\r\nthings of great value by shipwreck, he scrupled not to say amongst his\r\nfriends, that (371) “the fishes would bring them back to him.”  At Naples\r\nhe heard of the insurrection in Gaul, on the anniversary of the day on\r\nwhich he killed his mother, and bore it with so much unconcern, as to\r\nexcite a suspicion that he was really glad of it, since he had now a fair\r\nopportunity of plundering those wealthy provinces by the right of war.\r\nImmediately going to the gymnasium, he witnessed the exercise of the\r\nwrestlers with the greatest delight.  Being interrupted at supper with\r\nletters which brought yet worse news, he expressed no greater resentment,\r\nthan only to threaten the rebels.  For eight days together, he never\r\nattempted to answer any letters, nor give any orders, but buried the\r\nwhole affair in profound silence.\r\n\r\nXLI.  Being roused at last by numerous proclamations of Vindex, treating\r\nhim with reproaches and contempt, he in a letter to the senate exhorted\r\nthem to avenge his wrongs and those of the republic; desiring them to\r\nexcuse his not appearing in the senate-house, because he had got cold.\r\nBut nothing so much galled him, as to find himself railed at as a pitiful\r\nharper, and, instead of Nero, styled Aenobarbus: which being his family\r\nname, since he was upbraided with it, he declared that he would resume\r\nit, and lay aside the name he had taken by adoption.  Passing by the\r\nother accusations as wholly groundless, he earnestly refuted that of his\r\nwant of skill in an art upon which he had bestowed so much pains, and in\r\nwhich he had arrived at such perfection; asking frequently those about\r\nhim, “if they knew any one who was a more accomplished musician?”  But\r\nbeing alarmed by messengers after messengers of ill news from Gaul, he\r\nreturned in great consternation to Rome.  On the road, his mind was\r\nsomewhat relieved, by observing the frivolous omen of a Gaulish soldier\r\ndefeated and dragged by the hair by a Roman knight, which was sculptured\r\non a monument; so that he leaped for joy, and adored the heavens.  Even\r\nthen he made no appeal either to the senate or people, but calling\r\ntogether some of the leading men at his own house, he held a hasty\r\nconsultation upon the present state of affairs, and then, during the\r\nremainder of the day, carried them about with him to view some musical\r\ninstruments, of a new invention, which were played by water [620] (372)\r\nexhibiting all the parts, and discoursing upon the principles and\r\ndifficulties of the contrivance; which, he told them, he intended to\r\nproduce in the theatre, if Vindex would give him leave.\r\n\r\nXLII.  Soon afterwards, he received intelligence that Galba and the\r\nSpaniards had declared against him; upon which, he fainted, and losing\r\nhis reason, lay a long time speechless, apparently dead.  As soon as\r\nrecovered from this state stupefaction he tore his clothes, and beat his\r\nhead, crying out, “It is all over with me!”  His nurse endeavouring to\r\ncomfort him, and telling him that the like things had happened to other\r\nprinces before him, he replied, “I am beyond all example wretched, for I\r\nhave lost an empire whilst I am still living.”  He, nevertheless, abated\r\nnothing of his luxury and inattention to business.  Nay, on the arrival\r\nof good news from the provinces, he, at a sumptuous entertainment, sung\r\nwith an air of merriment, some jovial verses upon the leaders of the\r\nrevolt, which were made public; and accompanied them with suitable\r\ngestures.  Being carried privately to the theatre, he sent word to an\r\nactor who was applauded by the spectators, “that he had it all his own\r\nway, now that he himself did not appear on the stage.”\r\n\r\nXLIII.  At the first breaking out of these troubles, it is believed that\r\nhe had formed many designs of a monstrous nature, although conformable\r\nenough to his natural disposition.  These were to send new governors and\r\ncommanders to the provinces and the armies, and employ assassins to\r\nbutcher all the former governors and commanders, as men unanimously\r\nengaged in a conspiracy against him; to massacre the exiles in every\r\nquarter, and all the Gaulish population in Rome; the former lest they\r\nshould join the insurrection; the latter as privy to the designs of their\r\ncountrymen, and ready to support (373) them; to abandon Gaul itself, to\r\nbe wasted and plundered by his armies; to poison the whole senate at a\r\nfeast; to fire the city, and then let loose the wild beasts upon the\r\npeople, in order to impede their stopping the progress of the flames.\r\nBut being deterred from the execution of these designs not so much by\r\nremorse of conscience, as by despair of being able to effect them, and\r\njudging an expedition into Gaul necessary, he removed the consuls from\r\ntheir office, before the time of its expiration was arrived; and in their\r\nroom assumed the consulship himself without a colleague, as if the fates\r\nhad decreed that Gaul should not be conquered, but by a consul.  Upon\r\nassuming the fasces, after an entertainment at the palace, as he walked\r\nout of the room leaning on the arms of some of his friends, he declared,\r\nthat as soon as he arrived in the province, he would make his appearance\r\namongst the troops, unarmed, and do nothing but weep: and that, after he\r\nhad brought the mutineers to repentance, he would, the next day, in the\r\npublic rejoicings, sing songs of triumph, which he must now, without loss\r\nof time, apply himself to compose.\r\n\r\nXLIV.  In preparing for this expedition, his first care was to provide\r\ncarriages for his musical instruments and machinery to be used upon the\r\nstage; to have the hair of the concubines he carried with him dressed in\r\nthe fashion of men; and to supply them with battle-axes, and Amazonian\r\nbucklers.  He summoned the city-tribes to enlist; but no qualified\r\npersons appearing, he ordered all masters to send a certain number of\r\nslaves, the best they had, not excepting their stewards and secretaries.\r\nHe commanded the several orders of the people to bring in a fixed\r\nproportion of their estates, as they stood in the censor’s books; all\r\ntenants of houses and mansions to pay one year’s rent forthwith into the\r\nexchequer; and, with unheard-of strictness, would receive only new coin\r\nof the purest silver and the finest gold; insomuch that most people\r\nrefused to pay, crying out unanimously that he ought to squeeze the\r\ninformers, and oblige them to surrender their gains.\r\n\r\nXLV.  The general odium in which he was held received an increase by the\r\ngreat scarcity of corn, and an occurrence connected with it.  For, as it\r\nhappened just at that time, there arrived from Alexandria a ship, which\r\nwas said to be freighted (374) with dust for the wrestlers belonging to\r\nthe emperor [621].  This so much inflamed the public rage, that he was\r\ntreated with the utmost abuse and scurrility.  Upon the top of one of his\r\nstatues was placed the figure of a chariot with a Greek inscription, that\r\n“Now indeed he had a race to run; let him be gone.”  A little bag was\r\ntied about another, with a ticket containing these words; “What could I\r\ndo?”--“Truly thou hast merited the sack.” [622]  Some person likewise\r\nwrote on the pillars in the forum, “that he had even woke the cocks [623]\r\nwith his singing.”  And many, in the night-time, pretending to find fault\r\nwith their servants, frequently called for a Vindex. [624]\r\n\r\nXLVI.  He was also terrified with manifest warnings, both old and new,\r\narising from dreams, auspices, and omens.  He had never been used to\r\ndream before the murder of his mother.  After that event, he fancied in\r\nhis sleep that he was steering a ship, and that the rudder was forced\r\nfrom him: that he was dragged by his wife Octavia into a prodigiously\r\ndark place; and was at one time covered over with a vast swarm of winged\r\nants, and at another, surrounded by the national images which were set up\r\nnear Pompey’s theatre, and hindered from advancing farther; that a\r\nSpanish jennet he was fond of, had his hinder parts so changed, as to\r\nresemble those of an ape; and having his head only left unaltered,\r\nneighed very harmoniously.  The doors of the mausoleum of Augustus flying\r\nopen of themselves, there issued from it a voice, calling on him by name.\r\nThe Lares being adorned with fresh garlands on the calends (the first) of\r\nJanuary, fell down during the preparations for sacrificing to them.\r\nWhile he was taking (375) the omens, Sporus presented him with a ring,\r\nthe stone of which had carved upon it the Rape of Proserpine.  When a\r\ngreat multitude of the several orders was assembled, to attend at the\r\nsolemnity of making vows to the gods, it was a long time before the keys\r\nof the Capitol could be found.  And when, in a speech of his to the\r\nsenate against Vindex, these words were read, “that the miscreants should\r\nbe punished and soon make the end they merited,” they all cried out, “You\r\nwill do it, Augustus.”  It was likewise remarked, that the last tragic\r\npiece which he sung, was Oedipus in Exile, and that he fell as he was\r\nrepeating this verse:\r\n\r\n    Thanein m’ anoge syngamos, maetaer, pataer.\r\n    Wife, mother, father, force me to my end.\r\n\r\nXLVII.  Meanwhile, on the arrival of the news, that the rest of the\r\narmies had declared against him, he tore to pieces the letters which were\r\ndelivered to him at dinner, overthrew the table, and dashed with violence\r\nagainst the ground two favourite cups, which he called Homer’s, because\r\nsome of that poet’s verses were cut upon them.  Then taking from Locusta\r\na dose of poison, which he put up in a golden box, he went into the\r\nServilian gardens, and thence dispatching a trusty freedman to Ostia,\r\nwith orders to make ready a fleet, he endeavoured to prevail with some\r\ntribunes and centurions of the pretorian guards to attend him in his\r\nflight; but part of them showing no great inclination to comply, others\r\nabsolutely refusing, and one of them crying out aloud,\r\n\r\n    Usque adeone mori miserum est?\r\n    Say, is it then so sad a thing to die? [625]\r\n\r\nhe was in great perplexity whether he should submit himself to Galba, or\r\napply to the Parthians for protection, or else appear before the people\r\ndressed in mourning, and, upon the rostra, in the most piteous manner,\r\nbeg pardon for his past misdemeanors, and, if he could not prevail,\r\nrequest of them to grant him at least the government of Egypt.  A speech\r\nto this purpose was afterwards found in his writing-case.  But it is\r\nconjectured that he durst not venture upon this project, for fear of\r\nbeing torn to pieces, before he could get to the Forum.  Deferring,\r\ntherefore, his resolution until the next (376) day, he awoke about\r\nmidnight, and finding the guards withdrawn, he leaped out of bed, and\r\nsent round for his friends.  But none of them vouchsafing any message in\r\nreply, he went with a few attendants to their houses.  The doors being\r\nevery where shut, and no one giving him any answer, he returned to his\r\nbed-chamber; whence those who had the charge of it had all now eloped;\r\nsome having gone one way, and some another, carrying off with them his\r\nbedding and box of poison.  He then endeavoured to find Spicillus, the\r\ngladiator, or some one to kill him; but not being able to procure any\r\none, “What!” said he, “have I then neither friend nor foe?” and\r\nimmediately ran out, as if he would throw himself into the Tiber.\r\n\r\nXLVIII.  But this furious impulse subsiding, he wished for some place of\r\nprivacy, where he might collect his thoughts; and his freedman Phaon\r\noffering him his country-house, between the Salarian [626] and Nomentan\r\n[627] roads, about four miles from the city, he mounted a horse, barefoot\r\nas he was, and in his tunic, only slipping over it an old soiled cloak;\r\nwith his head muffled up, and an handkerchief before his face, and four\r\npersons only to attend him, of whom Sporus was one.  He was suddenly\r\nstruck with horror by an earthquake, and by a flash of lightning which\r\ndarted full in his face, and heard from the neighbouring camp [628] the\r\nshouts of the soldiers, wishing his destruction, and prosperity to Galba.\r\nHe also heard a traveller they met on the road, say, “They are (377) in\r\npursuit of Nero:” and another ask, “Is there any news in the city about\r\nNero?”  Uncovering his face when his horse was started by the scent of a\r\ncarcase which lay in the road, he was recognized and saluted by an old\r\nsoldier who had been discharged from the guards.  When they came to the\r\nlane which turned up to the house, they quitted their horses, and with\r\nmuch difficulty he wound among bushes, and briars, and along a track\r\nthrough a bed of rushes, over which they spread their cloaks for him to\r\nwalk on.  Having reached a wall at the back of the villa, Phaon advised\r\nhim to hide himself awhile in a sand-pit; when he replied, “I will not go\r\nunder-ground alive.”  Staying there some little time, while preparations\r\nwere made for bringing him privately into the villa, he took up some\r\nwater out of a neighbouring tank in his hand, to drink, saying, “This is\r\nNero’s distilled water.” [629]  Then his cloak having been torn by the\r\nbrambles, he pulled out the thorns which stuck in it.  At last, being\r\nadmitted, creeping upon his hands and knees, through a hole made for him\r\nin the wall, he lay down in the first closet he came to, upon a miserable\r\npallet, with an old coverlet thrown over it; and being both hungry and\r\nthirsty, though he refused some coarse bread that was brought him, he\r\ndrank a little warm water.\r\n\r\nXLIX.  All who surrounded him now pressing him to save himself from the\r\nindignities which were ready to befall him, he ordered a pit to be sunk\r\nbefore his eyes, of the size of his body, and the bottom to be covered\r\nwith pieces of marble put together, if any could be found about the\r\nhouse; and water and wood [630], to be got ready for immediate use about\r\nhis corpse; weeping at every thing that was done, and frequently saying,\r\n“What an artist is now about to perish!”  Meanwhile, letters being\r\nbrought in by a servant belonging to Phaon, he snatched them out of his\r\nhand, and there read, “That he had been declared an enemy by the senate,\r\nand that search was making for him, that he might be punished according\r\nto the ancient custom of the Romans.”  He then inquired what kind of\r\npunishment that was; and being told, that the (378) practice was to strip\r\nthe criminal naked, and scourge him to death, while his neck was fastened\r\nwithin a forked stake, he was so terrified that he took up two daggers\r\nwhich he had brought with him, and after feeling the points of both, put\r\nthem up again, saying, “The fatal hour is not yet come.”  One while, he\r\nbegged of Sporus to begin to wail and lament; another while, he entreated\r\nthat one of them would set him an example by killing himself; and then\r\nagain, he condemned his own want of resolution in these words: “I yet\r\nlive to my shame and disgrace: this is not becoming for Nero: it is not\r\nbecoming.  Thou oughtest in such circumstances to have a good heart:\r\nCome, then: courage, man!” [631]  The horsemen who had received orders to\r\nbring him away alive, were now approaching the house.  As soon as he\r\nheard them coming, he uttered with a trembling voice the following verse,\r\n\r\n    Hippon m’ okupodon amphi ktupos ouata ballei; [632]\r\n    The noise of swift-heel’d steeds assails my ears;\r\n\r\nhe drove a dagger into his throat, being assisted in the act by\r\nEpaphroditus, his secretary.  A centurion bursting in just as he was\r\nhalf-dead, and applying his cloak to the wound, pretending that he was\r\ncome to his assistance, he made no other reply but this, “‘Tis too late;”\r\n and “Is this your loyalty?”  Immediately after pronouncing these words,\r\nhe expired, with his eyes fixed and starting out of his head, to the\r\nterror of all who beheld him.  He had requested of his attendants, as the\r\nmost essential favour, that they would let no one have his head, but that\r\nby all means his body might be burnt entire.  And this, Icelus, Galba’s\r\nfreedman, granted.  He had but a little before been discharged from the\r\nprison into which he had been thrown, when the disturbances first broke\r\nout.\r\n\r\nL.  The expenses of his funeral amounted to two hundred thousand\r\nsesterces; the bed upon which his body was carried to the pile and burnt,\r\nbeing covered with the white robes, interwoven with gold, which he had\r\nworn upon the calends of January preceding.  His nurses, Ecloge and\r\nAlexandra, with his concubine Acte, deposited his remains in the tomb\r\nbelonging (379) to the family of the Domitii, which stands upon the top\r\nof the Hill of the Gardens [633], and is to be seen from the Campus\r\nMartius.  In that monument, a coffin of porphyry, with an altar of marble\r\nof Luna over it, is enclosed by a wall built of stone brought from\r\nThasos. [634]\r\n\r\nLI.  In stature he was a little below the common height; his skin was\r\nfoul and spotted; his hair inclined to yellow; his features were\r\nagreeable, rather than handsome; his eyes grey and dull, his neck was\r\nthick, his belly prominent, his legs very slender, his constitution\r\nsound.  For, though excessively luxurious in his mode of living, he had,\r\nin the course of fourteen years, only three fits of sickness; which were\r\nso slight, that he neither forbore the use of wine, nor made any\r\nalteration in his usual diet.  In his dress, and the care of his person,\r\nhe was so careless, that he had his hair cut in rings, one above another;\r\nand when in Achaia, he let it grow long behind; and he generally appeared\r\nin public in the loose dress which he used at table, with a handkerchief\r\nabout his neck, and without either a girdle or shoes.\r\n\r\nLII.  He was instructed, when a boy, in the rudiments of almost all the\r\nliberal sciences; but his mother diverted him from the study of\r\nphilosophy, as unsuited to one destined to be an emperor; and his\r\npreceptor, Seneca, discouraged him from reading the ancient orators, that\r\nhe might longer secure his devotion to himself.  Therefore, having a turn\r\nfor poetry, (380) he composed verses both with pleasure and ease; nor did\r\nhe, as some think, publish those of other writers as his own.  Several\r\nlittle pocket-books and loose sheets have cone into my possession, which\r\ncontain some well-known verses in his own hand, and written in such a\r\nmanner, that it was very evident, from the blotting and interlining, that\r\nthey had not been transcribed from a copy, nor dictated by another, but\r\nwere written by the composer of them.\r\n\r\nLIII.  He had likewise great taste for drawing and painting, as well as\r\nfor moulding statues in plaster.  But, above all things, he most eagerly\r\ncoveted popularity, being the rival of every man who obtained the\r\napplause of the people for any thing he did.  It was the general belief,\r\nthat, after the crowns he won by his performances on the stage, he would\r\nthe next lustrum have taken his place among the wrestlers at the Olympic\r\ngames.  For he was continually practising that art; nor did he witness\r\nthe gymnastic games in any part of Greece otherwise than sitting upon the\r\nground in the stadium, as the umpires do.  And if a pair of wrestlers\r\nhappened to break the bounds, he would with his own hands drag them back\r\ninto the centre of the circle.  Because he was thought to equal Apollo in\r\nmusic, and the sun in chariot-driving, he resolved also to imitate the\r\nachievements of Hercules.  And they say that a lion was got ready for him\r\nto kill, either with a club, or with a close hug, in view of the people\r\nin the amphitheatre; which he was to perform naked.\r\n\r\nLIV.  Towards the end of his life, he publicly vowed, that if his power\r\nin the state was securely re-established, he would, in the spectacles\r\nwhich he intended to exhibit in honour of his success, include a\r\nperformance upon organs [635], as well as upon flutes and bagpipes, and,\r\non the last day of the games, would act in the play, and take the part of\r\nTurnus, as we find it in Virgil.  And there are some who say, that he put\r\nto death the player Paris as a dangerous rival.\r\n\r\nLV.  He had an insatiable desire to immortalize his name, and acquire a\r\nreputation which should last through all succeeding ages; but it was\r\ncapriciously directed.  He therefore (381) took from several things and\r\nplaces their former appellations, and gave them new names derived from\r\nhis own.  He called the month of April, Neroneus, and designed changing\r\nthe name of Rome into that of Neropolis.\r\n\r\nLVI.  He held all religious rites in contempt, except those of the Syrian\r\nGoddess [636]; but at last he paid her so little reverence, that he made\r\nwater upon her; being now engaged in another superstition, in which only\r\nhe obstinately persisted.  For having received from some obscure plebeian\r\na little image of a girl, as a preservative against plots, and\r\ndiscovering a conspiracy immediately after, he constantly worshipped his\r\nimaginary protectress as the greatest amongst the gods, offering to her\r\nthree sacrifices daily.  He was also desirous to have it supposed that he\r\nhad, by revelations from this deity, a knowledge of future events.  A few\r\nmonths before he died, he attended a sacrifice, according to the Etruscan\r\nrites, but the omens were not favourable.\r\n\r\nLVII.  He died in the thirty-second year of his age [637], upon the same\r\nday on which he had formerly put Octavia to death; and the public joy was\r\nso great upon the occasion, that the common people ran about the city\r\nwith caps upon their heads.  Some, however, were not wanting, who for a\r\nlong time decked his tomb with spring and summer flowers.  Sometimes they\r\nplaced his image upon the rostra, dressed in robes of state; at another,\r\nthey published proclamations in his name, as if he were still alive, and\r\nwould shortly return to Rome, and take vengeance on all his enemies.\r\nVologesus, king of the Parthians, when he sent ambassadors to the senate\r\nto renew his alliance with the Roman people, earnestly requested that due\r\nhonour should be paid to the memory of Nero; and, to conclude, when,\r\ntwenty years afterwards, at which time I was a young man [638], some\r\nperson of obscure birth gave himself out for Nero, that name secured him\r\nso favourable a reception (382) from the Parthians, that he was very\r\nzealously supported, and it was with much difficulty that they were\r\nprevailed upon to give him up.\r\n\r\n    *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThough no law had ever passed for regulating the transmission of the\r\nimperial power, yet the design of conveying it by lineal descent was\r\nimplied in the practice of adoption.  By the rule of hereditary\r\nsuccession, Britannicus, the son of Claudius, was the natural heir to the\r\nthrone; but he was supplanted by the artifices of his stepmother, who had\r\nthe address to procure it for her own son, Nero.  From the time of\r\nAugustus it had been the custom of each of the new sovereigns to commence\r\nhis reign in such a manner as tended to acquire popularity, however much\r\nthey all afterwards degenerated from those specious beginnings.  Whether\r\nthis proceeded entirely from policy, or that nature was not yet vitiated\r\nby the intoxication of uncontrolled power, is uncertain; but such were\r\nthe excesses into which they afterwards plunged, that we can scarcely\r\nexempt any of them, except, perhaps, Claudius, from the imputation of\r\ngreat original depravity.  The vicious temper of Tiberius was known to\r\nhis own mother, Livia; that of Caligula had been obvious to those about\r\nhim from his infancy; Claudius seems to have had naturally a stronger\r\ntendency to weakness than to vice; but the inherent wickedness of Nero\r\nwas discovered at an early period by his preceptor, Seneca.  Yet even\r\nthis emperor commenced his reign in a manner which procured him\r\napprobation.  Of all the Roman emperors who had hitherto reigned, he\r\nseems to have been most corrupted by profligate favourites, who flattered\r\nhis follies and vices, to promote their own aggrandisement.  In the\r\nnumber of these was Tigellinus, who met at last with the fate which he\r\nhad so amply merited.\r\n\r\nThe several reigns from the death of Augustus present us with uncommon\r\nscenes of cruelty and horror; but it was reserved for that of Nero to\r\nexhibit to the world the atrocious act of an emperor deliberately\r\nprocuring the death of his mother.\r\n\r\nJulia Agrippina was the daughter of Germanicus, and married Domitius\r\nAenobarbus, by whom she had Nero.  At the death of Messalina she was a\r\nwidow; and Claudius, her uncle, entertaining a design of entering again\r\ninto the married state, she aspired to an incestuous alliance with him,\r\nin competition with Lollia Paulina, a woman of beauty and intrigue, who\r\nhad been married to C. Caesar.  The two rivals were strongly supported by\r\ntheir (383) respective parties; but Agrippina, by her superior interest\r\nwith the emperor’s favourites, and the familiarity to which her near\r\nrelation gave her a claim, obtained the preference; and the portentous\r\nnuptials of the emperor and his niece were publicly solemnized in the\r\npalace.  Whether she was prompted to this flagrant indecency by personal\r\nambition alone, or by the desire of procuring the succession to the\r\nempire for her son, is uncertain; but there remains no doubt of her\r\nhaving removed Claudius by poison, with a view to the object now\r\nmentioned.  Besides Claudius, she projected the death of L. Silanus, and\r\nshe accomplished that of his brother, Junius Silanus, by means likewise\r\nof poison.  She appears to have been richly endowed with the gifts of\r\nnature, but in her disposition intriguing, violent, imperious, and ready\r\nto sacrifice every principle of virtue, in the pursuit of supreme power\r\nor sensual gratification.  As she resembled Livia in the ambition of a\r\nmother, and the means by which she indulged it, so she more than equalled\r\nher in the ingratitude of an unnatural son and a parricide.  She is said\r\nto have left behind her some memoirs, of which Tacitus availed himself in\r\nthe composition of his Annals.\r\n\r\nIn this reign, the conquest of the Britons still continued to be the\r\nprincipal object of military enterprise, and Suetonius Paulinus was\r\ninvested with the command of the Roman army employed in the reduction of\r\nthat people.  The island of Mona, now Anglesey, being the chief seat of\r\nthe Druids, he resolved to commence his operations with attacking a place\r\nwhich was the centre of superstition, and to which the vanquished Britons\r\nretreated as the last asylum of liberty.  The inhabitants endeavoured,\r\nboth by force of arms and the terrors of religion, to obstruct his\r\nlanding on this sacred island.  The women and Druids assembled\r\npromiscuously with the soldiers upon the shore, where running about in\r\nwild disorder, with flaming torches in their hands, and pouring forth the\r\nmost hideous exclamations, they struck the Romans with consternation.\r\nBut Suetonius animating his troops, they boldly attacked the inhabitants,\r\nrouted them in the field, and burned the Druids in the same fires which\r\nhad been prepared by those priests for the catastrophe of the invaders,\r\ndestroying at the same time all the consecrated groves and altars in the\r\nisland.  Suetonius having thus triumphed over the religion of the\r\nBritons, flattered himself with the hopes of soon effecting the reduction\r\nof the people.  But they, encouraged by his absence, had taken arms, and\r\nunder the conduct of Boadicea, queen of the Iceni, who had been treated\r\nin the most ignominious manner by the Roman tribunes, had already driven\r\nthe hateful invaders from their several settlements.  Suetonius hastened\r\nto (384) the protection of London, which was by this time a flourishing\r\nRoman colony; but he found upon his arrival, that any attempt to preserve\r\nit would be attended with the utmost danger to the army.  London\r\ntherefore was reduced to ashes; and the Romans, and all strangers, to the\r\nnumber of seventy thousand, were put to the sword without distinction,\r\nthe Britons seeming determined to convince the enemy that they would\r\nacquiesce in no other terms than a total evacuation of the island.  This\r\nmassacre, however, was revenged by Suetonius in a decisive engagement,\r\nwhere eighty thousand of the Britons are said to have been killed; after\r\nwhich, Boadicea, to avoid falling into the hands of the insolent\r\nconquerors, put a period to her own life by means of poison.  It being\r\njudged unadvisable that Suetonius should any longer conduct the war\r\nagainst a people whom he had exasperated by his severity, he was\r\nrecalled, and Petronius Turpilianus appointed in his room.  The command\r\nwas afterwards given successively to Trebellius Maximus and Vettius\r\nBolanus; but the plan pursued by these generals was only to retain, by a\r\nconciliatory administration, the parts of the island which had already\r\nsubmitted to the Roman arms.\r\n\r\nDuring these transactions in Britain, Nero himself was exhibiting, in\r\nRome or some of the provinces, such scenes of extravagance as almost\r\nexceed credibility.  In one place, entering the lists amongst the\r\ncompetitors in a chariot race; in another, contending for victory with\r\nthe common musicians on the stage; revelling in open day in the company\r\nof the most abandoned prostitutes and the vilest of men; in the night,\r\ncommitting depredations on the peaceful inhabitants of the capital;\r\npolluting with detestable lust, or drenching with human blood, the\r\nstreets, the palace, and the habitations of private families; and, to\r\ncrown his enormities, setting fire to Rome, while he sung with delight in\r\nbeholding the dreadful conflagration.  In vain would history be ransacked\r\nfor a parallel to this emperor, who united the most shameful vices to the\r\nmost extravagant vanity, the most abject meanness to the strongest but\r\nmost preposterous ambition; and the whole of whose life was one continued\r\nscene of lewdness, sensuality, rapine, cruelty, and folly.  It is\r\nemphatically observed by Tacitus, “that Nero, after the murder of many\r\nillustrious personages, manifested a desire of extirpating virtue\r\nitself.”\r\n\r\nAmong the excesses of Nero’s reign, are to be mentioned the horrible\r\ncruelties exercised against the Christians in various parts of the\r\nempire, in which inhuman transactions the natural barbarity of the\r\nemperor was inflamed by the prejudices and interested policy of the pagan\r\npriesthood.\r\n\r\n(385) The tyrant scrupled not to charge them with the act of burning\r\nRome; and he satiated his fury against them by such outrages as are\r\nunexampled in history.  They were covered with the skins of wild beasts,\r\nand torn by dogs; were crucified, and set on fire, that they might serve\r\nfor lights in the night-time.  Nero offered his gardens for this\r\nspectacle, and exhibited the games of the Circus by this dreadful\r\nillumination.  Sometimes they were covered with wax and other combustible\r\nmaterials, after which a sharp stake was put under their chin, to make\r\nthem stand upright, and they were burnt alive, to give light to the\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\nIn the person of Nero, it is observed by Suetonius, the race of the\r\nCaesars became extinct; a race rendered illustrious by the first and\r\nsecond emperors, but which their successors no less disgraced.  The\r\ndespotism of Julius Caesar, though haughty and imperious, was liberal and\r\nhumane: that of Augustus, if we exclude a few instances of vindictive\r\nseverity towards individuals, was mild and conciliating; but the reigns\r\nof Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero (for we except Claudius from part of the\r\ncensure), while discriminated from each other by some peculiar\r\ncircumstances, exhibited the most flagrant acts of licentiousness and\r\nperverted authority.  The most abominable lust, the most extravagant\r\nluxury, the most shameful rapaciousness, and the most inhuman cruelty,\r\nconstitute the general characteristics of those capricious and detestable\r\ntyrants.  Repeated experience now clearly refuted the opinion of\r\nAugustus, that he had introduced amongst the Romans the best form of\r\ngovernment: but while we make this observation, it is proper to remark,\r\nthat, had he even restored the republic, there is reason to believe that\r\nthe nation would again have been soon distracted with internal divisions,\r\nand a perpetual succession of civil wars.  The manners of the people were\r\nbecome too dissolute to be restrained by the authority of elective and\r\ntemporary magistrates; and the Romans were hastening to that fatal period\r\nwhen general and great corruption, with its attendant debility, would\r\nrender them an easy prey to any foreign invaders.\r\n\r\nBut the odious government of the emperors was not the only grievance\r\nunder which the people laboured in those disastrous times: patrician\r\navarice concurred with imperial rapacity to increase the sufferings of\r\nthe nation.  The senators, even during the commonwealth, had become\r\nopenly corrupt in the dispensation of public justice; and under the\r\ngovernment of the emperors pernicious abuse was practised to a yet\r\ngreater extent.  That class being now, equally with other Roman citizens,\r\ndependent on the sovereign power, their sentiments of duty and (386)\r\nhonour were degraded by the loss of their former dignity; and being\r\nlikewise deprived of the lucrative governments of provinces, to which\r\nthey had annually succeeded by an elective rotation in the times of the\r\nrepublic, they endeavoured to compensate the reduction of their\r\nemoluments by an unbounded venality in the judicial decisions of the\r\nforum.  Every source of national happiness and prosperity was by this\r\nmeans destroyed.  The possession of property became precarious; industry,\r\nin all its branches, was effectually discouraged, and the amor patriae,\r\nwhich had formerly been the animating principle of the nation, was almost\r\nuniversally extinguished.\r\n\r\nIt is a circumstance corresponding to the general singularity of the\r\npresent reign, that, of the few writers who flourished in it, and whose\r\nworks have been transmitted to posterity, two ended their days by the\r\norder of the emperor, and the third, from indignation at his conduct.\r\nThese unfortunate victims were Seneca, Petronius Arbiter, and Lucan.\r\n\r\nSENECA was born about six years before the Christian aera, and gave early\r\nindication of uncommon talents.  His father, who had come from Corduba to\r\nRome, was a man of letters, particularly fond of declamation, in which he\r\ninstructed his son, and placed him, for the acquisition of philosophy,\r\nunder the most celebrated stoics of that age.  Young Seneca, imbibing the\r\nprecepts of the Pythagorean doctrine, religiously abstained from eating\r\nthe flesh of animals, until Tiberius having threatened to punish some\r\nJews and Egyptians, who abstained from certain meats, he was persuaded by\r\nhis father to renounce the Pythagorean practice.  Seneca displayed the\r\ntalents of an eloquent speaker; but dreading the jealousy of Caligula,\r\nwho aspired to the same excellence, he thought proper to abandon that\r\npursuit, and apply himself towards suing for the honours and offices of\r\nthe state.  He accordingly obtained the place of quaestor, in which\r\noffice incurring the imputation of a scandalous amour with Julia Livia,\r\nhe removed from Rome, and was banished by the emperor Claudius to\r\nCorsica.\r\n\r\nUpon the marriage of Claudius with Agrippina, Seneca was recalled from\r\nhis exile, in which he had remained near eight years, and was appointed\r\nto superintend the education of Nero, now destined to become the\r\nsuccessor to the throne.  In the character of preceptor he appears to\r\nhave acquitted himself with ability and credit; though he has been\r\ncharged by his enemies with having initiated his pupil in those\r\ndetestable vices which disgraced the reign of Nero.  Could he have indeed\r\nbeen guilty of such immoral conduct, it is probable that he would not so\r\neasily have (387) forfeited the favour of that emperor; and it is more\r\nreasonable to suppose, that his disapprobation of Nero’s conduct was the\r\nreal cause of that odium which soon after proved fatal to him.  By the\r\nenemies whom distinguished merit and virtue never fail to excite at a\r\nprofligate court, Seneca was accused of having maintained a criminal\r\ncorrespondence with Agrippina in the life-time of Claudius; but the chief\r\nauthor of this calumny was Suilius, who had been banished from Rome at\r\nthe instance of Seneca.  He was likewise charged with having amassed\r\nexorbitant riches, with having built magnificent houses, and formed\r\nbeautiful gardens, during the four years in which he had acted as\r\npreceptor to Nero.  This charge he considered as a prelude to his\r\ndestruction; which to avoid, if possible, he requested of the emperor to\r\naccept of the riches and possessions which he had acquired in his\r\nsituation at court, and to permit him to withdraw himself into a life of\r\nstudious retirement.  Nero, dissembling his secret intentions, refused\r\nthis request; and Seneca, that he might obviate all cause of suspicion or\r\noffence, kept himself at home for some time, under the pretext of\r\nindisposition.\r\n\r\nUpon the breaking out of the conspiracy of Piso, in which some of the\r\nprincipal senators were concerned, Natalis, the discoverer of the plot,\r\nmentioned Seneca’s name, as an accessory.  There is, however, no\r\nsatisfactory evidence that Seneca had any knowledge of the plot.  Piso,\r\naccording to the declaration of Natalis, had complained that he never saw\r\nSeneca; and the latter had observed, in answer, that it was not conducive\r\nto their common interest to see each other often.  Seneca likewise\r\npleaded indisposition, and said that his own life depended upon the\r\nsafety of Piso’s person.  Nero, however, glad of such an occasion of\r\nsacrificing the philosopher to his secret jealousy, sent him an order to\r\ndestroy himself.  When the messenger arrived with this mandate, Seneca\r\nwas sitting at table, with his wife Paulina and two of his friends.  He\r\nheard the message not only with philosophical firmness, but even with\r\nsymptoms of joy, and observed, that such an honour might long have been\r\nexpected from a man who had assassinated all his friends, and even\r\nmurdered his own mother.  The only request which he made, was, that he\r\nmight be permitted to dispose of his possessions as he pleased; but this\r\nwas refused him.  Immediately turning himself to his friends, who were\r\nweeping at his melancholy fate, he said to them, that, since he could not\r\nleave them what he considered as his own property, he should leave at\r\nleast his own life for an example; an innocence of conduct which they\r\nmight imitate, and by which they might acquire immortal fame.  He\r\nremonstrated with composure against their unavailing tears and (388)\r\nlamentations, and asked them, whether they had not learnt better to\r\nsustain the shocks of fortune, and the violence of tyranny?\r\n\r\nThe emotions of his wife he endeavoured to allay with philosophical\r\nconsolation; and when she expressed a resolution to die with him, he\r\nsaid, that he was glad to find his example imitated with so much\r\nfortitude.  The veins of both were opened at the same time; but Nero’s\r\ncommand extending only to Seneca, the life of Paulina was preserved; and,\r\naccording to some authors, she was not displeased at being prevented from\r\ncarrying her precipitate resolution into effect.  Seneca’s veins bleeding\r\nbut slowly, an opportunity was offered him of displaying in his last\r\nmoments a philosophical magnanimity similar to that of Socrates; and it\r\nappears that his conversation during this solemn period was maintained\r\nwith dignified composure.  To accelerate his lingering fate, he drank a\r\ndose of poison; but this producing no effect, he ordered his attendants\r\nto carry him into a warm bath, for the purpose of rendering the\r\nhaemorrhage from his veins more copious.  This expedient proving likewise\r\nineffectual, and the soldiers who witnessed the execution of the\r\nemperor’s order being clamorous for its accomplishment, he was removed\r\ninto a stove, and suffocated by the steam.  He underwent his fate on the\r\n12th of April, in the sixty-fifth year of the Christian aera, and the\r\nfifty-third year of his age.  His body was burnt, and his ashes deposited\r\nin a private manner, according to his will, which had been made during\r\nthe period when he was in the highest degree of favour with Nero.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Seneca are numerous, and on various subjects.  His first\r\ncomposition, addressed to Novacus, is on Anger, and continued through\r\nthree books.  After giving a lively description of this passion, the\r\nauthor discusses a variety of questions concerning it: he argues strongly\r\nagainst its utility, in contradiction to the peripatetics, and recommends\r\nits restraint, by many just and excellent considerations.  This treatise\r\nmay be regarded, in its general outlines, as a philosophical\r\namplification of the passage in Horace:--\r\n\r\n    Ira furor brevis est: animum rege; qui, nisi paret,\r\n    Imperat: hunc fraenis, hunc tu compesce catena.\r\n                                              Epist. I. ii.\r\n\r\n    Anger’s a fitful madness: rein thy mind,\r\n    Subdue the tyrant, and in fetters bind,\r\n    Or be thyself the slave.\r\n\r\nThe next treatise is on Consolation, addressed to his mother, Helvia, and\r\nwas written during his exile.  He there informs his mother that he bears\r\nhis banishment with fortitude, and advises her to do the same.  He\r\nobserves, that, in respect to himself, (389) change of place, poverty,\r\nignominy, and contempt, are not real evils; that there may be two reasons\r\nfor her anxiety on his account; first, that, by his absence, she is\r\ndeprived of his protection; and in the next place, of the satisfaction\r\narising from his company; on both which heads he suggests a variety of\r\npertinent observations.  Prefixed to this treatise, are some epigrams\r\nwritten on the banishment of Seneca, but whether or not by himself, is\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\nImmediately subsequent to the preceding, is another treatise on\r\nConsolation, addressed to one of Claudius’s freedmen, named Polybius,\r\nperhaps after the learned historian.  In this tract, which is in several\r\nparts mutilated, the author endeavours to console Polybius for the loss\r\nof a brother who had lately died.  The sentiments and admonitions are\r\nwell suggested for the purpose; but they are intermixed with such fulsome\r\nencomiums on the imperial domestic, as degrade the dignity of the author,\r\nand can be ascribed to no other motive than that of endeavouring to\r\nprocure a recall from his exile, through the interest of Polybius.\r\n\r\nA fourth treatise on Consolation is addressed to Marcia, a respectable\r\nand opulent lady, the daughter of Cremutius Cordus, by whose death she\r\nwas deeply affected.  The author, besides many consolatory arguments,\r\nproposes for her imitation a number of examples, by attending to which\r\nshe may be enabled to overcome a passion that is founded only in too\r\ngreat sensibility of mind.  The subject is ingeniously prosecuted, not\r\nwithout the occasional mixture of some delicate flattery, suitable to the\r\ncharacter of the correspondent.\r\n\r\nThese consolatory addresses are followed by a treatise on Providence,\r\nwhich evinces the author to have entertained the most just and\r\nphilosophical sentiments on that subject.  He infers the necessary\r\nexistence of a Providence from the regularity and constancy observed in\r\nthe government of the universe but his chief object is to show, why, upon\r\nthe principle that a Providence exists, good men should be liable to\r\nevils.  The enquiry is conducted with a variety of just observations, and\r\ngreat force of argument; by which the author vindicates the goodness and\r\nwisdom of the Almighty, in a strain of sentiment corresponding to the\r\nmost approved suggestions of natural religion.\r\n\r\nThe next treatise, which is on Tranquillity of Mind, appears to have been\r\nwritten soon after his return from exile.  There is a confusion in the\r\narrangement of this tract; but it contains a variety of just\r\nobservations, and may be regarded as a valuable production.\r\n\r\n(390) Then follows a discourse on the Constancy of a Wise Man.  This has\r\nby some been considered as a part of the preceding treatise; but they are\r\nevidently distinct.  It is one of the author’s best productions, in\r\nregard both of sentiment and composition, and contains a fund of moral\r\nobservations, suited to fortify the mind under the oppression of\r\naccidental calamities.\r\n\r\nWe next meet with a tract on Clemency, in two books, addressed to Nero.\r\nThis appears to have been written in the beginning of the reign of Nero,\r\non whom the author bestows some high encomiums, which, at that time, seem\r\nnot to have been destitute of foundation.  The discourse abounds with\r\njust observation, applicable to all ranks of men; and, if properly\r\nattended to by that infatuated emperor, might have prevented the\r\nperpetration of those acts of cruelty, which, with his other\r\nextravagancies, have rendered his name odious to posterity.\r\n\r\nThe discourse which succeeds is on the Shortness of Life, addressed to\r\nPaulinus.  In this excellent treatise the author endeavours to show, that\r\nthe complaint of the shortness of life is not founded in truth: that it\r\nis men who make life short, either by passing it in indolence, or\r\notherwise improperly.  He inveighs against indolence, luxury, and every\r\nunprofitable avocation; observing, that the best use of time is to apply\r\nit to the study of wisdom, by which life may be rendered sufficiently\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nNext follows a discourse on a Happy Life, addressed to Gallio.  Seneca\r\nseems to have intended this as a vindication of himself, against those\r\nwho calumniated him on account of his riches and manner of living.  He\r\nmaintained that a life can only be rendered happy by its conformity to\r\nthe dictates of virtue, but that such a life is perfectly compatible with\r\nthe possession of riches, where they happen to accrue.  The author pleads\r\nhis own cause with great ability, as well as justness of argument.  His\r\nvindication is in many parts highly beautiful, and accompanied with\r\nadmirable sentiments respecting the moral obligations to a virtuous life.\r\nThe conclusion of this discourse bears no similarity, in point of\r\ncomposition, to the preceding parts, and is evidently spurious.\r\n\r\nThe preceding discourse is followed by one upon the Retirement of a Wise\r\nMan.  The beginning of this tract is wanting; but in the sequel the\r\nauthor discusses a question which was much agitated amongst the Stoics\r\nand Epicureans, viz., whether a wise man ought to concern himself with\r\nthe affairs of the public.  Both these sects of philosophers maintained\r\nthat a life of retirement was most suitable to a wise man, but they\r\ndiffered with respect to the circumstances in which it might be proper to\r\ndeviate from this conduct; one party considering the deviation (391) as\r\nprudent, when there existed a just motive for such conduct, and the\r\nother, when there was no forcible reason against it.  Seneca regards both\r\nthese opinions as founded upon principles inadequate to the advancement\r\nboth of public and private happiness, which ought ever to be the ultimate\r\nobject of moral speculation.\r\n\r\nThe last of the author’s discourses, addressed to Aebucius, is on\r\nBenefits, and continued through seven books.  He begins with lamenting\r\nthe frequency of ingratitude amongst mankind, a vice which he severely\r\ncensures.  After some preliminary considerations respecting the nature of\r\nbenefits, he proceeds to show in what manner, and on whom, they ought to\r\nbe conferred.  The greater part of these books is employed on the\r\nsolution of abstract questions relative to benefits, in the manner of\r\nChrysippus; where the author states explicitly the arguments on both\r\nsides, and from the full consideration of them, deduces rational\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nThe Epistles of Seneca consist of one hundred and twenty-four, all on\r\nmoral subjects.  His Natural Questions extend through seven books, in\r\nwhich he has collected the hypotheses of Aristotle and other ancient\r\nwriters.  These are followed by a whimsical effusion on the death of\r\nCaligula.  The remainder of his works comprises seven Persuasive\r\nDiscourses, five books of Controversies, and ten books containing\r\nExtracts of Declamations.\r\n\r\nFrom the multiplicity of Seneca’s productions, it is evident, that,\r\nnotwithstanding the luxurious life he is said to have led, he was greatly\r\ndevoted to literature, a propensity which, it is probable, was confirmed\r\nby his banishment during almost eight years in the island of Corsica,\r\nwhere he was in a great degree secluded from every other resource of\r\namusement to a cultivated mind.  But with whatever splendour Seneca’s\r\ndomestic economy may have been supported, it seems highly improbable that\r\nhe indulged himself in luxurious enjoyment to any vicious excess.  His\r\nsituation at the Roman court, being honourable and important, could not\r\nfail of being likewise advantageous, not only from the imperial profusion\r\ncommon at that time, but from many contingent emoluments which his\r\nextensive interest and patronage would naturally afford him.  He was born\r\nof a respectable rank, lived in habits of familiar intercourse with\r\npersons of the first distinction, and if, in the course of his attendance\r\nupon Nero, he had acquired a large fortune, no blame could justly attach\r\nto his conduct in maintaining an elegant hospitality.  The imputation of\r\nluxury was thrown upon him from two quarters, viz, by the dissolute\r\ncompanions of Nero, to whom the mention of such an example served as an\r\napology for their own extreme dissipation; (392) and by those who envied\r\nhim for the affluence and dignity which he had acquired.  The charge,\r\nhowever, is supported only by vague assertion, and is discredited by\r\nevery consideration which ought to have weight in determining the reality\r\nof human characters.  It seems totally inconsistent with his habits of\r\nliterary industry, with the virtuous sentiments which he every where\r\nstrenuously maintains, and the esteem with which he was regarded by a\r\nnumerous acquaintance, as a philosopher and a moralist.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Seneca have been traduced almost equally with his manner\r\nof living, though in both he has a claim to indulgence, from the fashion\r\nof the times.  He is more studious of minute embellishments in style than\r\nthe writers of the Augustan age; and the didactic strain, in which he\r\nmostly prosecutes his subjects, has a tendency to render him sententious;\r\nbut the expression of his thoughts is neither enfeebled by decoration,\r\nnor involved in obscurity by conciseness.  He is not more rich in\r\nartificial ornament than in moral admonition.  Seneca has been charged\r\nwith depreciating former writers, to render himself more conspicuous; a\r\ncharge which, so far as appears from his writings, is founded rather in\r\nnegative than positive testimony.  He has not endeavoured to establish\r\nhis fame by any affectation of singularity in doctrine; and while he\r\npasses over in silence the names of illustrious authors, he avails\r\nhimself with judgment of the most valuable stores with which they had\r\nenriched philosophy.  On the whole, he is an author whose principles may\r\nbe adopted not only with safety, but great advantage; and his writings\r\nmerit a degree of consideration, superior to what they have hitherto ever\r\nenjoyed in the literary world.\r\n\r\nSeneca, besides his prose works, was the author of some tragedies.  The\r\nMedea, the Troas, and the Hippolytus, are ascribed to him.  His father is\r\nsaid to have written the Hercules Furens, Thyestes, Agamemnon, and\r\nHercules Oetaeus.  The three remaining tragedies, the Thebais, Oedipus,\r\nand Octavia, usually published in the same collection with the seven\r\npreceding, are supposed to be the productions of other authors, but of\r\nwhom, is uncertain.  These several pieces are written in a neat style;\r\nthe plots and characters are conducted with an attention to probability\r\nand nature: but none of them is so forcible, in point of tragical\r\ndistress, as to excite in the reader any great degree of emotion.----\r\n\r\nPETRONIUS was a Roman knight, and apparently of considerable fortune.  In\r\nhis youth he seems to have given great application to polite literature,\r\nin which he acquired a justness of taste, as well as an elegance of\r\ncomposition.  Early initiated in the gaieties (393) of fashionable life,\r\nhe contracted a habit of voluptuousness which rendered him an\r\naccommodating companion to the dissipated and the luxurious.  The court\r\nof Claudius, entirely governed for some time by Messalina, was then the\r\nresidence of pleasure; and here Petronius failed not of making a\r\nconspicuous appearance.  More delicate, however, than sensual, he rather\r\njoined in the dissipation, than indulged in the vices of the palace.  To\r\ninterrupt a course of life too uniform to afford him perpetual\r\nsatisfaction, he accepted of the proconsulship of Bithynia, and went to\r\nthat province, where he discharged the duties of his office with great\r\ncredit.  Upon his return to Rome, Nero, who had succeeded Claudius, made\r\nhim consul, in recompense of his services.  This new dignity, by giving\r\nhim frequent and easy access to the emperor, created an intimacy between\r\nthem, which was increased to friendship and esteem on the side of Nero,\r\nby the elegant entertainments often given him by Petronius.  In a short\r\ntime, this gay voluptuary became so much a favourite at court, that\r\nnothing was agreeable but what was approved by Petronius and the\r\nauthority which he acquired, by being umpire in whatever related to the\r\neconomy of gay dissipation, procured him the title of Arbiter\r\nelegantiarum.  Things continued in this state whilst the emperor kept\r\nwithin the bounds of moderation; and Petronius acted as intendant of his\r\npleasures, ordering him shows, games, comedies, music, feats, and all\r\nthat could contribute to make the hours of relaxation pass agreeably;\r\nseasoning, at the same time, the innocent delights which he procured for\r\nthe emperor with every possible charm, to prevent him from seeking after\r\nsuch as might prove pernicious both to morals and the republic.  Nero,\r\nhowever, giving way to his own disposition, which was naturally vicious,\r\nat length changed his conduct, not only in regard to the government of\r\nthe empire, but of himself and listening to other counsels than those of\r\nPetronius, gave the entire reins to his passions, which afterwards\r\nplunged him in ruin.  The emperor’s new favourite was Tigellinus, a man\r\nof the most profligate morals, who omitted nothing that could gratify the\r\ninordinate appetites of his prince, at the expense of all decency and\r\nvirtue.  During this period, Petronius gave vent to his indignation, in\r\nthe satire transmitted under his name by the title of Satyricon.  But his\r\ntotal retirement from court did not secure him from the artifices of\r\nTigellinus, who laboured with all his power to destroy the man whom he\r\nhad industriously supplanted in the emperor’s favour.  With this view he\r\ninsinuated to Nero, that Petronius was too intimately connected with\r\nScevinus not to be engaged in Piso’s conspiracy; and, to support his\r\ncalumny, caused the emperor to be present at the examination (394) of one\r\nof Petronius’s slaves, whom he had secretly suborned to swear against his\r\nmaster.  After this transaction, to deprive Petronius of all means of\r\njustifying himself, they threw into prison the greatest part of his\r\ndomestics.  Nero embraced with joy the opportunity of removing a man, to\r\nwhom he knew the present manners of the court were utterly obnoxious, and\r\nhe soon after issued orders for arresting Petronius.  As it required,\r\nhowever, some time to deliberate whether they should put a person of his\r\nconsideration to death, without more evident proofs of the charges\r\npreferred against him, such was his disgust at living in the power of so\r\ndetestable and capricious a tyrant, that he resolved to die.  For this\r\npurpose, making choice of the same expedient which had been adopted by\r\nSeneca, he caused his veins to be opened, but he closed them again, for a\r\nlittle time, that he might enjoy the conversation of his friends, who\r\ncame to see him in his last moments.  He desired them, it is said, to\r\nentertain him, not with discourses on the immortality of the soul, or the\r\nconsolation of philosophy, but with agreeable tales and poetic\r\ngallantries.  Disdaining to imitate the servility of those who, dying by\r\nthe orders of Nero, yet made him their heir, and filled their wills with\r\nencomiums on the tyrant and his favourites, he broke to pieces a goblet\r\nof precious stones, out of which he had commonly drank, that Nero, who he\r\nknew would seize upon it after his death, might not have the pleasure of\r\nusing it.  As the only present suitable to such a prince, he sent him,\r\nunder a sealed cover, his Satyricon, written purposely against him; and\r\nthen broke his signet, that it might not, after his death, become the\r\nmeans of accusation against the person in whose custody it should be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe Satyricon of Petronius is one of the most curious productions in the\r\nLatin language.  Novel in its nature, and without any parallel in the\r\nworks of antiquity, some have imagined it to be a spurious composition,\r\nfabricated about the time of the revival of learning in Europe.  This\r\nconjecture, however, is not more destitute of support, than repugnant to\r\nthe most circumstantial evidence in favour of its authenticity.  Others,\r\nadmitting the work to be a production of the age of Nero, have questioned\r\nthe design with which it was written, and have consequently imputed to\r\nthe author a most immoral intention.  Some of the scenes, incidents, and\r\ncharacters, are of so extraordinary a nature, that the description of\r\nthem, without a particular application, must have been regarded as\r\nextremely whimsical, and the work, notwithstanding its ingenuity, has\r\nbeen doomed to perpetual oblivion: but history justifies the belief, that\r\nin the court of Nero, the extravagancies mentioned by Petronius were\r\nrealized (395) to a degree which authenticates the representation given\r\nof them.  The inimitable character of Trimalchio, which exhibits a person\r\nsunk in the most debauched effeminacy, was drawn for Nero; and we are\r\nassured, that there were formerly medals of that emperor, with these\r\nwords, C. Nero August. Imp., and on the reverse, Trimalchio.  The various\r\ncharacters are well discriminated, and supported with admirable\r\npropriety.  Never was such licentiousness of description united to such\r\ndelicacy of colouring.  The force of the satire consists not in poignancy\r\nof sentiment, but in the ridicule which arises from the whimsical, but\r\ncharacteristic and faithful exhibition of the objects introduced.  That\r\nNero was struck with the justness of the representation, is evident from\r\nthe displeasure which he showed, at finding Petronius so well acquainted\r\nwith his infamous excesses.  After levelling his suspicion on all who\r\ncould possibly have betrayed him, he at last fixed on a senator’s wife,\r\nnamed Silia, who bore a part in his revels, and was an intimate friend of\r\nPetronius upon which she was immediately sent into banishment.  Amongst\r\nthe miscellaneous materials in this work, are some pieces of poetry,\r\nwritten in an elegant taste.  A poem on the civil war between Caesar and\r\nPompey, is beautiful and animated.\r\n\r\nThough the Muses appear to have been mostly in a quiescent state from the\r\ntime of Augustus, we find from Petronius Arbiter, who exhibits the\r\nmanners of the capital during the reign of Nero, that poetry still\r\ncontinued to be a favourite pursuit amongst the Romans, and one to which,\r\nindeed, they seem to have had a national propensity.\r\n\r\n    --------Ecce inter pocula quaerunt\r\n    Romulidae saturi, quid dia poemata narrent.--Persius, Sat. i. 30.\r\n\r\n    ----Nay, more! Our nobles, gorged, and swilled with wine,\r\n    Call o’er the banquet for a lay divine!--Gifford.\r\n\r\nIt was cultivated as a kind of fashionable exercise, in short and\r\ndesultory attempts, in which the chief ambition was to produce verses\r\nextempore.  They were publicly recited by their authors with great\r\nostentation; and a favourable verdict from an audience, however partial,\r\nand frequently obtained either by intrigue or bribery, was construed by\r\nthose frivolous pretenders into a real adjudication of poetical fame.\r\n\r\nThe custom of publicly reciting poetical compositions, with the view of\r\nobtaining the opinion of the hearers concerning them, and for which\r\npurpose Augustus had built the Temple of Apollo, was well calculated for\r\nthe improvement of taste and judgment, as well as the excitement of\r\nemulation; but, conducted as it now was, it led to a general degradation\r\nof poetry.  Barbarism in (396) language, and a corruption of taste, were\r\nthe natural consequences of this practice, while the judgment of the\r\nmultitude was either blind or venal, and while public approbation\r\nsanctioned the crudities of hasty composition.  There arose, however, in\r\nthis period, some candidates for the bays, who carried their efforts\r\nbeyond the narrow limits which custom and inadequate genius prescribed to\r\nthe poetical exertions of their contemporaries.  Amongst these were Lucan\r\nand Persius.----\r\n\r\nLUCAN was the son of Annaeus Mela, the brother of Seneca, the\r\nphilosopher.  He was born at Corduba, the original residence of the\r\nfamily, but came early to Rome, where his promising talents, and the\r\npatronage of his uncle, recommended him to the favour of Nero; by whom he\r\nwas raised to the dignity of an augur and quaestor before he had attained\r\nthe usual age.  Prompted by the desire of displaying his political\r\nabilities, he had the imprudence to engage in a competition with his\r\nimperial patron.  The subject chosen by Nero was the tragical fate of\r\nNiobe; and that of Lucan was Orpheus.  The ease with which the latter\r\nobtained the victory in the contest, excited the jealousy of the emperor,\r\nwho resolved upon depressing his rising genius.  With this view, he\r\nexposed him daily to the mortification of fresh insults, until at last\r\nthe poet’s resentment was so much provoked, that he entered into the\r\nconspiracy of Piso for cutting off the tyrant.  The plot being\r\ndiscovered, there remained for the unfortunate Lucan no hope of pardon:\r\nand choosing the same mode of death which was employed by his uncle, he\r\nhad his veins opened, while he sat in a warm bath, and expired in\r\npronouncing with great emphasis the following lines in his Pharsalia:--\r\n\r\n    Scinditur avulsus; nec sicut vulnere sanguis\r\n    Emicuit lentus: ruptis cadit undique venis;\r\n    Discursusque animae diversa in membra meantis\r\n    Interceptus aquis, nullius, vita perempti\r\n    Est tanta dimissa via.--Lib. iii. 638.\r\n\r\n                     ----Asunder flies the man.\r\n    No single wound the gaping rupture seems,\r\n    Where trickling crimson flows in tender streams;\r\n    But from an opening horrible and wide\r\n    A thousand vessels pour the bursting tide;\r\n    At once the winding channel’s course was broke,\r\n    Where wandering life her mazy journey took.--Rowe.\r\n\r\nSome authors have said that he betrayed pusillanimity at the hour of\r\ndeath; and that, to save himself from punishment, he (397) accused his\r\nmother of being involved in the conspiracy.  This circumstance, however,\r\nis not mentioned by other writers, who relate, on the contrary, that he\r\ndied with philosophical fortitude.  He was then only in the twenty-sixth\r\nyear of his age.\r\n\r\nLucan had scarcely reached the age of puberty when he wrote a poem on the\r\ncontest between Hector and Achilles.  He also composed in his youth a\r\npoem on the burning of Rome; but his only surviving work is the\r\nPharsalia, written on the civil war between Caesar and Pompey.  This\r\npoem, consisting of ten books, is unfinished, and its character has been\r\nmore depreciated than that of any other production of antiquity.  In the\r\nplan of the poem, the author prosecutes the different events in the civil\r\nwar, beginning his narrative at the passage of the Rubicon by Caesar.  He\r\ninvokes not the muses, nor engages any gods in the dispute; but\r\nendeavours to support an epic dignity by vigour of sentiment, and\r\nsplendour of description.  The horrors of civil war, and the importance\r\nof a contest which was to determine the fate of Rome and the empire of\r\nthe world, are displayed with variety of colouring, and great energy of\r\nexpression.  In the description of scenes, and the recital of heroic\r\nactions, the author discovers a strong and lively imagination; while, in\r\nthose parts of the work which are addressed either to the understanding\r\nor the passions, he is bold, figurative, and animated.  Indulging too\r\nmuch in amplification, he is apt to tire with prolixity; but in all his\r\nexcursions he is ardent, elevated, impressive, and often brilliant.  His\r\nversification has not the smoothness which we admire in the compositions\r\nof Virgil, and his language is often involved in the intricacies of\r\ntechnical construction: but with all his defects, his beauties are\r\nnumerous; and he discovers a greater degree of merit than is commonly\r\nfound in the productions of a poet of twenty-six years of age, at which\r\ntime he died.----\r\n\r\nPERSIUS was born at Volaterrae, of an equestrian family, about the\r\nbeginning of the Christian aera.  His father dying when he was six years\r\nold, he was left to the care of his mother, for whom and for his sisters\r\nhe expresses the warmest affection.  At the age of twelve he came to\r\nRome, where, after attending a course of grammar and rhetoric under the\r\nrespective masters of those branches of education, he placed himself\r\nunder the tuition of Annaeus Cornutus, a celebrated stoic philosopher of\r\nthat time.  There subsisted between him and this preceptor so great a\r\nfriendship, that at his death, which happened in the twenty-ninth year of\r\nhis age, he bequeathed to Cornutus a handsome sum of money, and his\r\nlibrary.  The latter, however, accepting only the books, left the money\r\nto Persius’s sisters.\r\n\r\nPriscian, Quintilian, and other ancient writers, spear of Persius’s\r\nsatires as consisting of a book without any division.  They have since,\r\nhowever, been generally divided into six different satires, but by some\r\nonly into five.  The subjects of these compositions are, the vanity of\r\nthe poets in his time; the backwardness of youth to the cultivation of\r\nmoral science; ignorance and temerity in political administration,\r\nchiefly in allusion to the government of Nero: the fifth satire is\r\nemployed in evincing that the wise man also is free; in discussing which\r\npoint, the author adopts the observations used by Horace on the same\r\nsubject.  The last satire of Persius is directed against avarice.  In the\r\nfifth, we meet with a beautiful address to Cornutus, whom the author\r\ncelebrates for his amiable virtues, and peculiar talents for teaching.\r\nThe following lines, at the same time that they show how diligently the\r\npreceptor and his pupil were employed through the whole day in the\r\ncultivation of moral science, afford a more agreeable picture of domestic\r\ncomfort and philosophical conviviality, than might be expected in the\r\nfamily of a rigid stoic:\r\n\r\n    Tecum etenim longos memini consumere soles,\r\n    Et tecum primas epulis decerpere noctes.\r\n    Unum opus, et requiem pariter disponimus ambo:\r\n    Atque verecunda laxamus feria mensa.--Sat. v.\r\n\r\n    Can I forget how many a summer’s day,\r\n    Spent in your converse, stole, unmarked, away?\r\n    Or how, while listening with increased delight,\r\n    I snatched from feasts the earlier hours of night?--Gifford.\r\n\r\nThe satires of Persius are written in a free, expostulatory, and\r\nargumentative manner; possessing the same justness of sentiment as those\r\nof Horace, but exerted in the way of derision, and not with the admirable\r\nraillery of that facetious author.  They are regarded by many as obscure;\r\nbut this imputation arises more from unacquaintance with the characters\r\nand manners to which the author alludes, than from any peculiarity either\r\nin his language or composition.  His versification is harmonious; and we\r\nhave only to remark, in addition to similar examples in other Latin\r\nwriters, that, though Persius is acknowledged to have been both virtuous\r\nand modest, there are in the fourth satire a few passages which cannot\r\ndecently admit of being translated.  Such was the freedom of the Romans,\r\nin the use of some expressions, which just refinement has now exploded.--\r\n\r\nAnother poet, in this period, was FABRICIUS VEIENTO, who wrote a severe\r\nsatire against the priests of his time; as also one (399) against the\r\nsenators, for corruption in their judicial capacity.  Nothing remains of\r\neither of those productions; but, for the latter, the author was banished\r\nby Nero.\r\n\r\nThere now likewise flourished a lyric poet, CAESIUS BASSUS, to whom\r\nPersius has addressed his sixth satire.  He is said to have been, next to\r\nHorace, the best lyric poet among the Romans; but of his various\r\ncompositions, only a few inconsiderable fragments are preserved.\r\n\r\nTo the two poets now mentioned must be added POMPONIUS SECUNDUS, a man of\r\ndistinguished rank in the army, and who obtained the honour of a triumph\r\nfor a victory over a tribe of barbarians in Germany.  He wrote several\r\ntragedies, which in the judgment of Quintilian, were beautiful\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSERGIUS SULPICIUS GALBA.\r\n\r\n(400)\r\n\r\nI.  The race of the Caesars became extinct in Nero; an event\r\nprognosticated by various signs, two of which were particularly\r\nsignificant.  Formerly, when Livia, after her marriage with Augustus, was\r\nmaking a visit to her villa at Veii [639], an eagle flying by, let drop\r\nupon her lap a hen, with a sprig of laurel in her mouth, just as she had\r\nseized it.  Livia gave orders to have the hen taken care of, and the\r\nsprig of laurel set; and the hen reared such a numerous brood of\r\nchickens, that the villa, to this day, is called the Villa of the Hens\r\n[640].  The laurel groves flourished so much, that the Caesars procured\r\nthence the boughs and crowns they bore at their triumphs.  It was also\r\ntheir constant custom to plant others on the same spot, immediately after\r\na triumph; and it was observed that, a little before the death of each\r\nprince, the tree which had been set by him died away.  But in the last\r\nyear of Nero, the whole plantation of laurels perished to the very roots,\r\nand the hens all died.  About the same time, the temple of the Caesars\r\n[641] being struck with lightning, the heads of all the statues in it\r\nfell off at once; and Augustus’s sceptre was dashed from his hands.\r\n\r\nII.  Nero was succeeded by Galba [642], who was not in the remotest\r\ndegree allied to the family of the Caesars, but, without doubt, of very\r\nnoble extraction, being descended from a great and ancient family; for he\r\nalways used to put amongst his other titles, upon the bases of his\r\nstatues, his being great-grandson to Q. Catulus Capitolinus.  And when he\r\ncame to (401) be emperor, he set up the images of his ancestors in the\r\nhall [643] of the palace; according to the inscriptions on which, he\r\ncarried up his pedigree on the father’s side to Jupiter; and by the\r\nmother’s to Pasiphae, the wife of Minos.\r\n\r\nIII.  To give even a short account of the whole family, would be tedious.\r\nI shall, therefore, only slightly notice that branch of it from which he\r\nwas descended.  Why, or whence, the first of the Sulpicii who had the\r\ncognomen of Galba, was so called, is uncertain.  Some are of opinion,\r\nthat it was because he set fire to a city in Spain, after he had a long\r\ntime attacked it to no purpose, with torches dipped in the gum called\r\nGalbanum: others said he was so named, because, in a lingering disease,\r\nhe made use of it as a remedy, wrapped up in wool: others, on account of\r\nhis being prodigiously corpulent, such a one being called, in the\r\nlanguage of the Gauls, Galba; or, on the contrary, because he was of a\r\nslender habit of body, like those insects which breed in a sort of oak,\r\nand are called Galbae.  Sergius Galba, a person of consular rank [644],\r\nand the most eloquent man of his time, gave a lustre to the family.\r\nHistory relates, that, when he was pro-praetor of Spain, he perfidiously\r\nput to the sword thirty thousand Lusitanians, and by that means gave\r\noccasion to the war of Viriatus [645].  His grandson being incensed\r\nagainst Julius Caesar, whose lieutenant he had been in Gaul, because he\r\nwas through him disappointed of the consulship [646], joined with Cassius\r\nand Brutus in the conspiracy against him, for which he was condemned by\r\nthe Pedian law.  From him were descended the grandfather and father of\r\nthe emperor Galba.  The grandfather was more celebrated for his\r\napplication to study, than (402) for any figure he made in the\r\ngovernment.  For he rose no higher than the praetorship, but published a\r\nlarge and not uninteresting history.  His father attained to the\r\nconsulship [647]: he was a short man and hump-backed, but a tolerable\r\norator, and an industrious pleader.  He was twice married: the\r\nfirst of his wives was Mummia Achaica, daughter of Catulus, and\r\ngreat-grand-daughter of Lucius Mummius, who sacked Corinth [648]; and the\r\nother, Livia Ocellina, a very rich and beautiful woman, by whom it is\r\nsupposed he was courted for the nobleness of his descent.  They say, that\r\nshe was farther encouraged to persevere in her advances, by an incident\r\nwhich evinced the great ingenuousness of his disposition.  Upon her\r\npressing her suit, he took an opportunity, when they were alone, of\r\nstripping off his toga, and showing her the deformity of his person, that\r\nhe might not be thought to impose upon her.  He had by Achaica two sons,\r\nCaius and Sergius.  The elder of these, Caius [649], having very much\r\nreduced his estate, retired from town, and being prohibited by Tiberius\r\nfrom standing for a pro-consulship in his year, put an end to his own\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIV.  The emperor Sergius Galba was born in the consulship of M. Valerius\r\nMessala, and Cn. Lentulus, upon the ninth of the calends of January [24th\r\nDecember] [650], in a villa standing upon a hill, near Terracina, on the\r\nleft-hand side of the road to Fundi [651].  Being adopted by his\r\nstep-mother [652], he assumed the name of Livius, with the cognomen of\r\nOcella, and changed his praenomen; for he afterwards used that of Lucius,\r\ninstead of Sergius, until he arrived at the imperial dignity.  It is well\r\nknown, that when he came once, amongst other boys of his own age, to pay\r\nhis respects to Augustus, the latter, pinching his cheek, said to him,\r\n“And thou, child, too, wilt taste our imperial dignity.”  Tiberius,\r\nlikewise, being told that he would come to be emperor, but at an advanced\r\nage, exclaimed, “Let him live, then, since that does not concern me!”\r\n When his grandfather was offering sacrifice to (403) avert some ill omen\r\nfrom lightning, the entrails of the victim were snatched out of his hand\r\nby an eagle, and carried off into an oak-tree loaded with acorns.  Upon\r\nthis, the soothsayers said, that the family would come to be masters of\r\nthe empire, but not until many years had elapsed: at which he, smiling,\r\nsaid, “Ay, when a mule comes to bear a foal.”  When Galba first declared\r\nagainst Nero, nothing gave him so much confidence of success, as a mule’s\r\nhappening at that time to have a foal.  And whilst all others were shocked\r\nat the occurrence, as a most inauspicious prodigy, he alone regarded it as\r\na most fortunate omen, calling to mind the sacrifice and saying of his\r\ngrandfather.  When he took upon him the manly habit, he dreamt that the\r\ngoddess Fortune said to him, “I stand before your door weary; and unless I\r\nam speedily admitted, I shall fall into the hands of the first who comes\r\nto seize me.”  On his awaking, when the door of the house was opened, he\r\nfound a brazen statue of the goddess, above a cubit long, close to the\r\nthreshold, which he carried with slim to Tusculum, where he used to pass\r\nthe summer season; and having consecrated it in an apartment of his house,\r\nhe ever after worshipped it with a monthly sacrifice, and an anniversary\r\nvigil.  Though but a very young man, he kept up an ancient but obsolete\r\ncustom, and now nowhere observed, except in his own family, which was, to\r\nhave his freedmen and slaves appear in a body before him twice a day,\r\nmorning and evening, to offer him their salutations.\r\n\r\nV.  Amongst other liberal studies, he applied himself to the law.  He\r\nmarried Lepida [653], by whom he had two sons; but the mother and\r\nchildren all dying, he continued a widower; nor could he be prevailed\r\nupon to marry again, not even Agrippina herself, at that time left a\r\nwidow by the death of Domitius, who had employed all her blandishments to\r\nallure him to her embraces, while he was a married man; insomuch that\r\nLepida’s mother, when in company with several married women, rebuked her\r\nfor it, and even went so far as to cuff her.  Most of all, he courted the\r\nempress Livia [654], by whose favour, while she was living, he made a\r\nconsiderable figure, and narrowly missed being enriched by the will which\r\nshe left at her death; in which she distinguished him from the rest of\r\nthe (404) legatees, by a legacy of fifty millions of sesterces.  But\r\nbecause the sum was expressed in figures, and not in words at length, it\r\nwas reduced by her heir, Tiberius, to five hundred thousand: and even\r\nthis he never received. [655]\r\n\r\nVI.  Filling the great offices before the age required for it by law,\r\nduring his praetorship, at the celebration of games in honour of the\r\ngoddess Flora, he presented the new spectacle of elephants walking upon\r\nropes.  He was then governor of the province of Aquitania for near a\r\nyear, and soon afterwards took the consulship in the usual course, and\r\nheld it for six months [656].  It so happened that he succeeded L.\r\nDomitius, the father of Nero, and was succeeded by Salvius Otho, father\r\nto the emperor of that name; so that his holding it between the sons of\r\nthese two men, looked like a presage of his future advancement to the\r\nempire.  Being appointed by Caius Caesar to supersede Gaetulicus in his\r\ncommand, the day after his joining the legions, he put a stop to their\r\nplaudits in a public spectacle, by issuing an order, “That they should\r\nkeep their hands under their cloaks.”  Immediately upon which, the\r\nfollowing verse became very common in the camp:\r\n\r\n    Disce, miles, militare: Galba est, non Gaetulicus.\r\n\r\n    Learn, soldier, now in arms to use your hands,\r\n    ‘Tis Galba, not Gaetulicus, commands.\r\n\r\nWith equal strictness, he would allow of no petitions for leave of\r\nabsence from the camp.  He hardened the soldiers, both old and young, by\r\nconstant exercise; and having quickly reduced within their own limits the\r\nbarbarians who had made inroads into Gaul, upon Caius’s coming into\r\nGermany, he so far recommended himself and his army to that emperor’s\r\napprobation, that, amongst the innumerable troops drawn from all the\r\nprovinces of the empire, none met with higher commendation, or greater\r\nrewards from him.  He likewise distinguished himself by heading an\r\nescort, with a shield in his hand [658], and running at the side of the\r\nemperor’s chariot twenty miles together.\r\n\r\nVII.  Upon the news of Caius’s death, though many earnestly pressed him\r\nto lay hold of that opportunity of seizing the empire, he chose rather to\r\nbe quiet.  On this account, he was in great favour with Claudius, and\r\nbeing received into the number of his friends, stood so high in his good\r\nopinion, that the expedition to Britain [659] was for some time\r\nsuspended, because he was suddenly seized with a slight indisposition.\r\nHe governed Africa, as pro-consul, for two years; being chosen out of the\r\nregular course to restore order in the province, which was in great\r\ndisorder from civil dissensions, and the alarms of the barbarians.  His\r\nadministration was distinguished by great strictness and equity, even in\r\nmatters of small importance.  A soldier upon some expedition being\r\ncharged with selling, in a great scarcity of corn, a bushel of wheat,\r\nwhich was all he had left, for a hundred denarii, he forbad him to be\r\nrelieved by any body, when he came to be in want himself; and accordingly\r\nhe died of famine.  When sitting in judgment, a cause being brought\r\nbefore him about some beast of burden, the ownership of which was claimed\r\nby two persons; the evidence being slight on both sides, and it being\r\ndifficult to come at the truth, he ordered the beast to be led to a pond\r\nat which he had used to be watered, with his head muffled up, and the\r\ncovering being there removed, that he should be the property of the\r\nperson whom he followed of his own accord, after drinking.\r\n\r\nVIII.  For his achievements, both at this time in Africa, and formerly in\r\nGermany, he received the triumphal ornaments, and three sacerdotal\r\nappointments, one among The Fifteen, another in the college of Titius,\r\nand a third amongst the Augustals; and from that time to the middle of\r\nNero’s reign, he lived for the most part in retirement.  He never went\r\nabroad (405) so much as to take the air, without a carriage attending\r\nhim, in which there was a million of sesterces in gold, ready at hand;\r\nuntil at last, at the time he was living in the town of Fundi, the\r\nprovince of Hispania Tarraconensis was offered him.  After his arrival in\r\nthe province, whilst he was sacrificing in a temple, a boy who attended\r\nwith a censer, became all on a sudden grey-headed.  This incident was\r\nregarded by some as a token of an approaching revolution in the\r\ngovernment, and that an old man would succeed a young one: that is, that\r\nhe would succeed Nero.  And not long after, a thunderbolt falling into a\r\nlake in Cantabria [660], twelve axes were found in it; a manifest sign of\r\nthe supreme power.\r\n\r\nIX.  He governed the province during eight years, his administration\r\nbeing of an uncertain and capricious character.  At first he was active,\r\nvigorous, and indeed excessively severe, in the punishment of offenders.\r\nFor, a money-dealer having committed some fraud in the way of his\r\nbusiness, he cut off his hands, and nailed them to his counter.  Another,\r\nwho had poisoned an orphan, to whom he was guardian, and next heir to the\r\nestate, he crucified.  On this delinquent imploring the protection of the\r\nlaw, and crying out that he was a Roman citizen, he affected to afford\r\nhim some alleviation, and to mitigate his punishment, by a mark of\r\nhonour, ordered a cross, higher than usual, and painted white, to be\r\nerected for him.  But by degrees he gave himself up to a life of\r\nindolence and inactivity, from the fear of giving Nero any occasion of\r\njealousy, and because, as he used to say, “Nobody was obliged to render\r\nan account of their leisure hours.”  He was holding a court of justice on\r\nthe circuit at New Carthage [661], when he received intelligence of the\r\ninsurrection in Gaul [662]; and while the lieutenant of Aquitania was\r\nsoliciting his assistance, letters were brought from Vindex, requesting\r\nhim “to assert the rights of mankind, and put himself at their head to\r\nrelieve them from the tyranny of Nero.”  Without any long demur, he\r\naccepted the invitation, from a mixture of fear and hope.  For he had\r\ndiscovered that private orders had been sent by Nero to his procurators\r\nin the province to get (407) him dispatched; and he was encouraged to the\r\nenterprise, as well by several auspices and omens, as by the prophecy of\r\na young woman of good, family.  The more so, because the priest of\r\nJupiter at Clunia [663], admonished by a dream, had discovered in the\r\nrecesses of the temple some verses similar to those in which she had\r\ndelivered her prophecy.  These had also been uttered by a girl under\r\ndivine inspiration, about two hundred years before.  The import of the\r\nverses was, “That in time, Spain should give the world a lord and\r\nmaster.”\r\n\r\nX.  Taking his seat on the tribunal, therefore, as if there was no other\r\nbusiness than the manumitting of slaves, he had the effigies of a number\r\nof persons who had been condemned and put to death by Nero, set up before\r\nhim, whilst a noble youth stood by, who had been banished, and whom he\r\nhad purposely sent for from one of the neighbouring Balearic isles; and\r\nlamenting the condition of the times, and being thereupon unanimously\r\nsaluted by the title of Emperor, he publicly declared himself “only the\r\nlieutenant of the senate and people of Rome.”  Then shutting the courts,\r\nhe levied legions and auxiliary troops among the provincials, besides his\r\nveteran army consisting of one legion, two wings of horse, and three\r\ncohorts.  Out of the military leaders most distinguished for age and\r\nprudence, he formed a kind of senate, with whom to advise upon all\r\nmatters of importance, as often as occasion should require.  He likewise\r\nchose several young men of the equestrian order, who were to be allowed\r\nthe privilege of wearing the gold ring, and, being called “The Reserve,”\r\n should mount guard before his bed-chamber, instead of the legionary\r\nsoldiers.  He likewise issued proclamations throughout the provinces of\r\nthe empire, exhorting all to rise in arms unanimously, and aid the common\r\ncause, by all the ways and means in their power.  About the same time, in\r\nfortifying a town, which he had pitched upon for a military post, a ring\r\nwas found, of antique workmanship, in the stone of which was engraved the\r\ngoddess Victory with a trophy.  Presently after, a ship of Alexandria\r\narrived at Dertosa [664], loaded with arms, without any person to steer\r\nit, or so much as a single sailor or passenger (408) on board.  From this\r\nincident, nobody entertained the least doubt but the war upon which they\r\nwere entering was just and honourable, and favoured likewise by the gods;\r\nwhen all on a sudden the whole design was exposed to failure.  One of the\r\ntwo wings of horse, repenting of the violation of their oath to Nero,\r\nattempted to desert him upon his approach to the camp, and were with some\r\ndifficulty kept in their duty.  And some slaves who had been presented to\r\nhim by a freedman of Nero’s, on purpose to murder him, had like to have\r\nkilled him as he went through a narrow passage to the bath.  Being\r\noverheard to encourage one another not to lose the opportunity, they were\r\ncalled to an account concerning it; and recourse being had to the\r\ntorture, a confession was extorted from them.\r\n\r\nXI.  These dangers were followed by the death of Vindex, at which being\r\nextremely discouraged, as if fortune had quite forsaken him, he had\r\nthoughts of putting an end to his own life; but receiving advice by his\r\nmessengers from Rome that Nero was slain, and that all had taken an oath\r\nto him as emperor, he laid aside the title of lieutenant, and took upon\r\nhim that of Caesar.  Putting himself upon his march in his general’s\r\ncloak, and a dagger hanging from his neck before his breast, he did not\r\nresume the use of the toga, until Nymphidius Sabinus, prefect of the\r\npretorian guards at Rome, with the two lieutenants, Fonteius Capito in\r\nGermany, and Claudius Macer in Africa, who opposed his advancement, were\r\nall put down.\r\n\r\nXII.  Rumours of his cruelty and avarice had reached the city before his\r\narrival; such as that he had punished some cities of Spain and Gaul, for\r\nnot joining him readily, by the imposition of heavy taxes, and some by\r\nlevelling their walls; and had put to death the governors and procurators\r\nwith their wives and children: likewise that a golden crown, of fifteen\r\npounds weight, taken out of the temple of Jupiter, with which he was\r\npresented by the people of Tarracona, he had melted down, and had exacted\r\nfrom them three ounces which were wanting in the weight.  This report of\r\nhim was confirmed and increased, as soon as he entered the town.  For\r\nsome seamen who had been taken from the fleet, and enlisted (409) among\r\nthe troops by Nero, he obliged to return to their former condition; but\r\nthey refusing to comply, and obstinately clinging to the more honourable\r\nservice under their eagles and standards, he not only dispersed them by a\r\nbody of horse, but likewise decimated them.  He also disbanded a cohort\r\nof Germans, which had been formed by the preceding emperors, for their\r\nbody-guard, and upon many occasions found very faithful; and sent them\r\nback into their own country, without giving them any gratuity, pretending\r\nthat they were more inclined to favour the advancement of Cneius\r\nDolabella, near whose gardens they encamped, than his own.  The following\r\nridiculous stories were also related of him; but whether with or without\r\nfoundation, I know not; such as, that when a more sumptuous entertainment\r\nthan usual was served up, he fetched a deep groan: that when one of the\r\nstewards presented him with an account of his expenses, he reached him a\r\ndish of legumes from his table as a reward for his care and diligence;\r\nand when Canus, the piper, had played much to his satisfaction, he\r\npresented him, with his own hand, five denarii taken out of his pocket.\r\n\r\nXIII.  His arrival, therefore, in town was not very agreeable to the\r\npeople; and this appeared at the next public spectacle.  For when the\r\nactors in a farce began a well-known song,\r\n\r\n      Venit, io, Simus [665] a villa:\r\n    Lo! Clodpate from his village comes;\r\n\r\nall the spectators, with one voice, went on with the rest, repeating and\r\nacting the first verse several times over.\r\n\r\nXIV.  He possessed himself of the imperial power with more favour and\r\nauthority than he administered it, although he gave many proofs of his\r\nbeing an excellent prince: but these were not so grateful to the people,\r\nas his misconduct was offensive.  He was governed by three favourites,\r\nwho, because they lived in the palace, and were constantly about him,\r\nobtained the name of his pedagogues.  These were Titus Vinius, who had\r\nbeen his lieutenant in Spain, a man of insatiable (410) avarice;\r\nCornelius Laco, who, from an assessor to the prince, was advanced to be\r\nprefect of the pretorian guards, a person of intolerable arrogance, as\r\nwell as indolence; and his freedman Icelus, dignified a little before\r\nwith the privilege of wearing the gold ring, and the use of the cognomen\r\nMartianus, who became a candidate for the highest honour within the reach\r\nof any person of the equestrian order [666].  He resigned himself so\r\nimplicitly into the power of those three favourites, who governed in\r\nevery thing according to the capricious impulse of their vices and\r\ntempers, and his authority was so much abused by them, that the tenor of\r\nhis conduct was not very consistent with itself.  At one time, he was\r\nmore rigorous and frugal, at another, more lavish and negligent, than\r\nbecame a prince who had been chosen by the people, and was so far\r\nadvanced in years.  He condemned some men of the first rank in the\r\nsenatorian and equestrian orders, upon a very slight suspicion, and\r\nwithout trial.  He rarely granted the freedom of the city to any one; and\r\nthe privilege belonging to such as had three children, only to one or\r\ntwo; and that with great difficulty, and only for a limited time.  When\r\nthe judges petitioned to have a sixth decury added to their number, he\r\nnot only denied them, but abolished the vacation which had been granted\r\nthem by Claudius for the winter, and the beginning of the year.\r\n\r\nXV.  It was thought that he likewise intended to reduce the offices held\r\nby senators and men of the equestrian order, to a term of two years’\r\ncontinuance; and to bestow them only on those who were unwilling to\r\naccept them, and had refused them.  All the grants of Nero he recalled,\r\nsaving only the tenth part of them.  For this purpose he gave a\r\ncommission to fifty Roman knights; with orders, that if players or\r\nwrestlers had sold what had been formerly given them, it should be\r\nexacted from the purchasers, since the others, having, no doubt, spent\r\nthe money, were not in a condition to pay.  But on the other hand, he\r\nsuffered his attendants and freedmen to sell or give away the revenue of\r\nthe state, or immunities from taxes, and to punish the innocent, or\r\npardon criminals, at pleasure.  Nay, when the Roman people were very\r\nclamorous for the punishment of Halotus and Tigellinus, two of the (411)\r\nmost mischievous amongst all the emissaries of Nero, he protected them,\r\nand even bestowed on Halotus one of the best procurations in his\r\ndisposal.  And as to Tigellinus, he even reprimanded the people for their\r\ncruelty by a proclamation.\r\n\r\nXVI.  By this conduct, he incurred the hatred of all orders of the\r\npeople, but especially of the soldiery.  For their commanders having\r\npromised them in his name a donative larger than usual, upon their taking\r\nthe oath to him before his arrival at Rome; he refused to make it good,\r\nfrequently bragging, “that it was his custom to choose his soldiers, not\r\nbuy them.”  Thus the troops became exasperated against him in all\r\nquarters.  The pretorian guards he alarmed with apprehensions of danger\r\nand unworthy treatment; disbanding many of them occasionally as\r\ndisaffected to his government, and favourers of Nymphidius.  But most of\r\nall, the army in Upper Germany was incensed against him, as being\r\ndefrauded of the rewards due to them for the service they had rendered in\r\nthe insurrection of the Gauls under Vindex.  They were, therefore, the\r\nfirst who ventured to break into open mutiny, refusing upon the calends\r\n[the 1st] of January, to take any oath of allegiance, except to the\r\nsenate; and they immediately dispatched deputies to the pretorian troops,\r\nto let them know, “they did not like the emperor who had been set up in\r\nSpain,” and to desire that “they would make choice of another, who might\r\nmeet with the approbation of all the armies.”\r\n\r\nXVII.  Upon receiving intelligence of this, imagining that he was\r\nslighted not so much on account of his age, as for having no children, he\r\nimmediately singled out of a company of young persons of rank, who came\r\nto pay their compliments to him, Piso Frugi Licinianus, a youth of noble\r\ndescent and great talents, for whom he had before contracted such a\r\nregard, that he had appointed him in his will the heir both of his estate\r\nand name.  Him he now styled his son, and taking him to the camp, adopted\r\nhim in the presence of the assembled troops, but without making any\r\nmention of a donative.  This circumstance afforded the better opportunity\r\nto Marcus Salvius Otho of accomplishing his object, six days after the\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nXVIII.  Many remarkable prodigies had happened from the (412) very\r\nbeginning of his reign, which forewarned him of his approaching fate.  In\r\nevery town through which he passed in his way from Spain to Rome, victims\r\nwere slain on the right and left of the roads; and one of these, which\r\nwas a bull, being maddened with the stroke of the axe, broke the rope\r\nwith which it was tied, and running straight against his chariot, with\r\nhis fore-feet elevated, bespattered him with blood.  Likewise, as he was\r\nalighting, one of the guard, being pushed forward by the crowd, had very\r\nnearly wounded him with his lance.  And upon his entering the city and,\r\nafterwards, the palace, he was welcomed with an earthquake, and a noise\r\nlike the bellowing of cattle.  These signs of ill-fortune were followed\r\nby some that were still more apparently such.  Out of all his treasures\r\nhe had selected a necklace of pearls and jewels, to adorn his statue of\r\nFortune at Tusculum.  But it suddenly occurring to him that it deserved a\r\nmore august place, he consecrated it to the Capitoline Venus; and next\r\nnight, he dreamt that Fortune appeared to him, complaining that she had\r\nbeen defrauded of the present intended her, and threatening to resume\r\nwhat she had given him.  Terrified at this denunciation, at break of day\r\nhe sent forward some persons to Tusculum, to make preparations for a\r\nsacrifice which might avert the displeasure of the goddess; and when he\r\nhimself arrived at the place, he found nothing but some hot embers upon\r\nthe altar, and an old man in black standing by, holding a little incense\r\nin a glass, and some wine in an earthern pot.  It was remarked, too, that\r\nwhilst he was sacrificing upon the calends of January, the chaplet fell\r\nfrom his head, and upon his consulting the pullets for omens, they flew\r\naway.  Farther, upon the day of his adopting Piso, when he was to\r\nharangue the soldiers, the seat which he used upon those occasions,\r\nthrough the neglect of his attendants, was not placed, according to\r\ncustom, upon his tribunal; and in the senate-house, his curule chair was\r\nset with the back forward.\r\n\r\nXIX.  The day before he was slain, as he was sacrificing in the morning,\r\nthe augur warned him from time to time to be upon his guard, for that he\r\nwas in danger from assassins, and that they were near at hand.  Soon\r\nafter, he was informed, that Otho was in possession of the pretorian\r\ncamp.  And though most of his friends advised him to repair thither\r\nimmediately, (413) in hopes that he might quell the tumult by his\r\nauthority and presence, he resolved to do nothing more than keep close\r\nwithin the palace, and secure himself by guards of the legionary\r\nsoldiers, who were quartered in different parts about the city.  He put\r\non a linen coat of mail, however, remarking at the same time, that it\r\nwould avail him little against the points of so many swords.  But being\r\ntempted out by false reports, which the conspirators had purposely spread\r\nto induce him to venture abroad--some few of those about him too hastily\r\nassuring him that the tumult had ceased, the mutineers were apprehended,\r\nand the rest coming to congratulate him, resolved to continue firm in\r\ntheir obedience--he went forward to meet them with so much confidence,\r\nthat upon a soldier’s boasting that he had killed Otho, he asked him, “By\r\nwhat authority?” and proceeded as far as the Forum.  There the knights,\r\nappointed to dispatch him, making their way through the crowd of\r\ncitizens, upon seeing him at a distance, halted a while; after which,\r\ngalloping up to him, now abandoned by all his attendants, they put him to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nXX.  Some authors relate, that upon their first approach he cried out,\r\n“What do you mean, fellow-soldiers?  I am yours, and you are mine,” and\r\npromised them a donative: but the generality of writers relate, that he\r\noffered his throat to them, saying, “Do your work, and strike, since you\r\nare resolved upon it.”  It is remarkable, that not one of those who were\r\nat hand, ever made any attempt to assist the emperor; and all who were\r\nsent for, disregarded the summons, except a troop of Germans.  They, in\r\nconsideration of his late kindness in showing them particular attention\r\nduring a sickness which prevailed in the camp, flew to his aid, but came\r\ntoo late; for, being not well acquainted with the town, they had taken a\r\ncircuitous route.  He was slain near the Curtian Lake [667], and there\r\nleft, until a common soldier returning from the receipt of his allowance\r\nof corn, throwing down the load which he carried, cut off his head.\r\nThere being upon it no hair, by which he might hold it, he hid it in the\r\nbosom of his dress; but afterwards thrusting his thumb into the mouth, he\r\ncarried it in that manner to Otho, who gave it to the drudges and slaves\r\nwho attended the soldiers; and they, fixing it upon the (414) point of a\r\nspear, carried it in derision round the camp, crying out as they went\r\nalong, “You take your fill of joy in your old age.”  They were irritated\r\nto this pitch of rude banter, by a report spread a few days before, that,\r\nupon some one’s commending his person as still florid and vigorous, he\r\nreplied,\r\n\r\n      Eti moi menos empedoi estin. [668]\r\n    My strength, as yet, has suffered no decay.\r\n\r\nA freedman of Petrobius’s, who himself had belonged to Nero’s family,\r\npurchased the head from them at the price of a hundred gold pieces, and\r\nthrew it into the place where, by Galba’s order, his patron had been put\r\nto death.  At last, after some time, his steward Argius buried it, with\r\nthe rest of his body, in his own gardens near the Aurelian Way.\r\n\r\nXXI.  In person he was of a good size, bald before, with blue eyes, and\r\nan aquiline nose; and his hands and feet were so distorted with the gout,\r\nthat he could neither wear a shoe, nor turn over the leaves of a book, or\r\nso much as hold it.  He had likewise an excrescence in his right side,\r\nwhich hung down to that degree, that it was with difficulty kept up by a\r\nbandage.\r\n\r\nXXII.  He is reported to have been a great eater, and usually took his\r\nbreakfast in the winter-time before day.  At supper, he fed very\r\nheartily, giving the fragments which were left, by handfuls, to be\r\ndistributed amongst the attendants.  In his lust, he was more inclined to\r\nthe male sex, and such of them too as were old.  It is said of him, that\r\nin Spain, when Icelus, an old catamite of his, brought him the news of\r\nNero’s death, he not only kissed him lovingly before company, but begged\r\nof him to remove all impediments, and then took him aside into a private\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nXXIII.  He perished in the seventy-third year of his age, and the seventh\r\nmonth of his reign [669].  The senate, as soon as they could with safety,\r\nordered a statue to be erected for him upon the naval column, in that\r\npart of the Forum where he (415) was slain.  But Vespasian cancelled the\r\ndecree, upon a suspicion that he had sent assassins from Spain into\r\nJudaea to murder him.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nGALBA was, for a private man, the most wealthy of any who had ever\r\naspired to the imperial dignity.  He valued himself upon his being\r\ndescended from the family of the Servii, but still more upon his relation\r\nto Quintus Catulus Capitolinus, celebrated for integrity and virtue.  He\r\nwas likewise distantly related to Livia, the wife of Augustus; by whose\r\ninterest he was preferred from the station which he held in the palace,\r\nto the dignity of consul; and who left him a great legacy at her death.\r\nHis parsimonious way of living, and his aversion to all superfluity or\r\nexcess, were construed into avarice as soon as he became emperor; whence\r\nPlutarch observes, that the pride which he took in his temperance and\r\neconomy was unseasonable.  While he endeavoured to reform the profusion\r\nin the public expenditure, which prevailed in the reign of Nero, he ran\r\ninto the opposite extreme; and it is objected to him by some historians,\r\nthat he maintained not the imperial dignity in a degree consistent even\r\nwith decency.  He was not sufficiently attentive either to his own\r\nsecurity or the tranquillity of the state, when he refused to pay the\r\nsoldiers the donative which he had promised them.  This breach of faith\r\nseems to be the only act in his life that affects his integrity; and it\r\ncontributed more to his ruin than even the odium which he incurred by the\r\nopen venality and rapaciousness of his favourites, particularly Vinius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  SALVIUS OTHO.\r\n\r\n(416)\r\n\r\nI.  The ancestors of Otho were originally of the town of Ferentum, of an\r\nancient and honourable family, and, indeed, one of the most considerable\r\nin Etruria.  His grandfather, M. Salvius Otho (whose father was a Roman\r\nknight, but his mother of mean extraction, for it is not certain whether\r\nshe was free-born), by the favour of Livia Augusta, in whose house he had\r\nhis education, was made a senator, but never rose higher than the\r\npraetorship.  His father, Lucius Otho, was by the mother’s side nobly\r\ndescended, allied to several great families, and so dearly beloved by\r\nTiberius, and so much resembled him in his features, that most people\r\nbelieved Tiberius was his father.  He behaved with great strictness and\r\nseverity, not only in the city offices, but in the pro-consulship of\r\nAfrica, and some extraordinary commands in the army.  He had the courage\r\nto punish with death some soldiers in Illyricum, who, in the disturbance\r\nattempted by Camillus, upon changing their minds, had put their generals\r\nto the sword, as promoters of that insurrection against Claudius.  He\r\nordered the execution to take place in the front of the camp [670], and\r\nunder his own eyes; though he knew they had been advanced to higher ranks\r\nin the army by Claudius, on that very account.  By this action he\r\nacquired fame, but lessened his favour at court; which, however, he soon\r\nrecovered, by discovering to Claudius a design upon his life, carried on\r\nby a Roman knight [671], and which he had learnt from some of his slaves.\r\nFor the senate ordered a statue of him to be erected in the palace; an\r\nhonour which had been conferred but upon very few before him.  And\r\nClaudius advanced him to the dignity of a patrician, commending him, at\r\nthe same time, in the highest terms, and concluding with these words: “A\r\nman, than whom I don’t so (417) much as wish to have children that should\r\nbe better.”  He had two sons by a very noble woman, Albia Terentia,\r\nnamely; Lucius Titianus, and a younger called Marcus, who had the same\r\ncognomen as himself.  He had also a daughter, whom he contracted to\r\nDrusus, Germanicus’s son, before she was of marriageable age.\r\n\r\nII.  The emperor Otho was born upon the fourth of the calends of May\r\n[28th April], in the consulship of Camillus Aruntius and Domitius\r\nAenobarbus [672].  He was from his earliest youth so riotous and wild,\r\nthat he was often severely scourged by his father.  He was said to run\r\nabout in the night-time, and seize upon any one he met, who was either\r\ndrunk or too feeble to make resistance, and toss him in a blanket [673].\r\nAfter his father’s death, to make his court the more effectually to a\r\nfreedwoman about the palace, who was in great favour, he pretended to be\r\nin love with her, though she was old, and almost decrepit.  Having by her\r\nmeans got into Nero’s good graces, he soon became one of the principal\r\nfavourites, by the congeniality of his disposition to that of the emperor\r\nor, as some say, by the reciprocal practice of mutual pollution.  He had\r\nso great a sway at court, that when a man of consular rank was condemned\r\nfor bribery, having tampered with him for a large sum of money, to\r\nprocure his pardon; before he had quite effected it, he scrupled not to\r\nintroduce him into the senate, to return his thanks.\r\n\r\nIII.  Having, by means of this woman, insinuated himself into all the\r\nemperor’s secrets, he, upon the day designed for the murder of his\r\nmother, entertained them both at a very splendid feast, to prevent\r\nsuspicion.  Poppaea Sabina, for whom Nero entertained such a violent\r\npassion that he had taken her from her husband [674] and entrusted her to\r\nhim, he received, and went through the form of marrying her.  And not\r\nsatisfied with obtaining her favours, he loved her so extravagantly, that\r\nhe could not with patience bear Nero for his rival.  It is certainly\r\nbelieved that he not only refused admittance to those who were sent by\r\nNero to fetch her, but that, on one (418) occasion, he shut him out, and\r\nkept him standing before the door, mixing prayers and menaces in vain,\r\nand demanding back again what was entrusted to his keeping.  His\r\npretended marriage, therefore, being dissolved, he was sent lieutenant\r\ninto Lusitania.  This treatment of him was thought sufficiently severe,\r\nbecause harsher proceedings might have brought the whole farce to light,\r\nwhich, notwithstanding, at last came out, and was published to the world\r\nin the following distich:--\r\n\r\n    Cur Otho mentitus sit, quaeritis, exul honore?\r\n      Uxoris moechus caeperat esse suae.\r\n\r\n    You ask why Otho’s banish’d?  Know, the cause\r\n    Comes not within the verge of vulgar laws.\r\n    Against all rules of fashionable life,\r\n    The rogue had dared to sleep with his own wife.\r\n\r\nHe governed the province in quality of quaestor for ten years, with\r\nsingular moderation and justice.\r\n\r\nIV.  As soon as an opportunity of revenge offered, he readily joined in\r\nGalba’s enterprises, and at the same time conceived hopes of obtaining\r\nthe imperial dignity for himself.  To this he was much encouraged by the\r\nstate of the times, but still more by the assurances given him by\r\nSeleucus, the astrologer, who, having formerly told him that he would\r\ncertainly out-live Nero, came to him at that juncture unexpectedly,\r\npromising him again that he should succeed to the empire, and that in a\r\nvery short time.  He, therefore, let slip no opportunity of making his\r\ncourt to every one about him by all manner of civilities.  As often as he\r\nentertained Galba at supper, he distributed to every man of the cohort\r\nwhich attended the emperor on guard, a gold piece; endeavouring likewise\r\nto oblige the rest of the soldiers in one way or another.  Being chosen\r\nan arbitrator by one who had a dispute with his neighbour about a piece\r\nof land, he bought it, and gave it him; so that now almost every body\r\nthought and said, that he was the only man worthy of succeeding to the\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nV.  He entertained hopes of being adopted by Galba, and expected it every\r\nday.  But finding himself disappointed, by Piso’s being preferred before\r\nhim, he turned his thoughts to obtaining his purpose by the use of\r\nviolence; and to this he was instigated, as well by the greatness of his\r\ndebts, as by resentment (419) at Galba’s conduct towards him.  For he did\r\nnot conceal his conviction, “that he could not stand his ground unless he\r\nbecame emperor, and that it signified nothing whether he fell by the\r\nhands of his enemies in the field, or of his creditors in the Forum.”  He\r\nhad a few days before squeezed out of one of the emperor’s slaves a\r\nmillion of sesterces for procuring him a stewardship; and this was the\r\nwhole fund he had for carrying on so great an enterprise.  At first the\r\ndesign was entrusted to only five of the guard, but afterwards to ten\r\nothers, each of the five naming two.  They had every one ten thousand\r\nsesterces paid down, and were promised fifty thousand more.  By these,\r\nothers were drawn in, but not many; from a confident assurance, that when\r\nthe matter came to the crisis, they should have enough to join them.\r\n\r\nVI.  His first intention was, immediately after the departure of Piso, to\r\nseize the camp, and fall upon Galba, whilst he was at supper in the\r\npalace; but he was restrained by a regard for the cohort at that time on\r\nduty, lest he should bring too great an odium upon it; because it\r\nhappened that the same cohort was on guard before, both when Caius was\r\nslain, and Nero deserted.  For some time afterwards, he was restrained\r\nalso by scruples about the omens, and by the advice of Seleucus.  Upon\r\nthe day fixed at last for the enterprise, having given his accomplices\r\nnotice to wait for him in the Forum near the temple of Saturn, at the\r\ngilded mile-stone [675], he went in the morning to pay his respects to\r\nGalba; and being received with a kiss as usual, he attended him at\r\nsacrifice, and heard the predictions of the augur [676].  A freedman of\r\nhis, then bringing (420) him word that the architects were come, which\r\nwas the signal agreed upon, he withdrew, as if it were with a design to\r\nview a house upon sale, and went out by a back-door of the palace to the\r\nplace appointed.  Some say he pretended to be seized with an ague fit,\r\nand ordered those about him to make that excuse for him, if he was\r\ninquired after.  Being then quickly concealed in a woman’s litter, he\r\nmade the best of his way for the camp.  But the bearers growing tired, he\r\ngot out, and began to run.  His shoe becoming loose, he stopped again,\r\nbut being immediately raised by his attendants upon their shoulders, and\r\nunanimously saluted by the title of EMPEROR, he came amidst auspicious\r\nacclamations and drawn swords into the Principia [677] in the camp; all\r\nwho met him joining in the cavalcade, as if they had been privy to the\r\ndesign.  Upon this, sending some soldiers to dispatch Galba and Piso, he\r\nsaid nothing else in his address to the soldiery, to secure their\r\naffections, than these few words: “I shall be content with whatever ye\r\nthink fit to leave me.”\r\n\r\nVII.  Towards the close of the day, he entered the senate, and after he\r\nhad made a short speech to them, pretending that he had been seized in\r\nthe streets, and compelled by violence to assume the imperial authority,\r\nwhich he designed to exercise in conjunction with them, he retired to the\r\npalace.  Besides other compliments which he received from those who\r\nflocked about him to congratulate and flatter him, he was called Nero by\r\nthe mob, and manifested no intention of declining that cognomen.  Nay,\r\nsome authors relate, that he used it in his official acts, and the first\r\nletters he sent to the (421) governors of provinces.  He suffered all his\r\nimages and statues to be replaced, and restored his procurators and\r\nfreedmen to their former posts.  And the first writing which he signed as\r\nemperor, was a promise of fifty millions of sesterces to finish the\r\nGolden-house [678].  He is said to have been greatly frightened that\r\nnight in his sleep, and to have groaned heavily; and being found, by\r\nthose who came running in to see what the matter was, lying upon the\r\nfloor before his bed, he endeavoured by every kind of atonement to\r\nappease the ghost of Galba, by which he had found himself violently\r\ntumbled out of bed.  The next day, as he was taking the omens, a great\r\nstorm arising, and sustaining a grievous fall, he muttered to himself\r\nfrom time to time:\r\n\r\n        Ti gar moi kai makrois aulois; [679]\r\n    What business have I the loud trumpets to sound!\r\n\r\nVIII.  About the same time, the armies in Germany took an oath to\r\nVitellius as emperor.  Upon receiving this intelligence, he advised the\r\nsenate to send thither deputies, to inform them, that a prince had been\r\nalready chosen; and to persuade them to peace and a good understanding.\r\nBy letters and messages, however, he offered Vitellius to make him his\r\ncolleague in the empire, and his son-in-law.  But a war being now\r\nunavoidable, and the generals and troops sent forward by Vitellius,\r\nadvancing, he had a proof of the attachment and fidelity of the pretorian\r\nguards, which had nearly proved fatal to the senatorian order.  It had\r\nbeen judged proper that some arms should be given out of the stores, and\r\nconveyed to the fleet by the marine troops.  While they were employed in\r\nfetching these from the camp in the night, some of the guards suspecting\r\ntreachery, excited a tumult; and suddenly the whole body, without any of\r\ntheir officers at their head, ran to the palace, demanding that the\r\nentire senate should be put to the sword; and having repulsed some of the\r\n(422) tribunes who endeavoured to stop them, and slain others, they\r\nbroke, all bloody as they were, into the banquetting room, inquiring for\r\nthe emperor; nor would they quit the place until they had seen him.  He\r\nnow entered upon his expedition against Vitellius with great alacrity,\r\nbut too much precipitation, and without any regard to the ominous\r\ncircumstances which attended it.  For the Ancilia [680] had been taken\r\nout of the temple of Mars, for the usual procession, but were not yet\r\nreplaced; during which interval it had of old been looked upon as very\r\nunfortunate to engage in any enterprise.  He likewise set forward upon\r\nthe day when the worshippers of the Mother of the gods [681] begin their\r\nlamentations and wailing.  Besides these, other unlucky omens attended\r\nhim.  For, in a victim offered to Father Dis [682], he found the signs\r\nsuch as upon all other occasions are regarded as favourable; whereas, in\r\nthat sacrifice, the contrary intimations are judged the most propitious.\r\nAt his first setting forward, he was stopped by inundations of the Tiber;\r\nand at twenty miles’ distance from the city, found the road blocked up by\r\nthe fall of houses.\r\n\r\nIX.  Though it was the general opinion that it would be proper to\r\nprotract the war, as the enemy were distressed by (423) famine and the\r\nstraitness of their quarters, yet he resolved with equal rashness to\r\nforce them to an engagement as soon as possible; whether from impatience\r\nof prolonged anxiety, and in the hope of bringing matters to an issue\r\nbefore the arrival of Vitellius, or because he could not resist the\r\nardour of the troops, who were all clamorous for battle.  He was not,\r\nhowever, present at any of those which ensued, but stayed behind at\r\nBrixellum [683].  He had the advantage in three slight engagements, near\r\nthe Alps, about Placentia, and a place called Castor’s [684]; but was, by\r\na fraudulent stratagem of the enemy, defeated in the last and greatest\r\nbattle, at Bedriacum [685].  For, some hopes of a conference being given,\r\nand the soldiers being drawn up to hear the conditions of peace declared,\r\nvery unexpectedly, and amidst their mutual salutations, they were obliged\r\nto stand to their arms.  Immediately upon this he determined to put an\r\nend to his life, more, as many think, and not without reason, out of\r\nshame, at persisting in a struggle for the empire to the hazard of the\r\npublic interest and so many lives, than from despair, or distrust of his\r\ntroops.  For he had still in reserve, and in full force, those whom he\r\nhad kept about him for a second trial of his fortune, and others were\r\ncoming up from Dalmatia, Pannonia, and Moesia; nor were the troops lately\r\ndefeated so far discouraged as not to be ready, even of themselves, to\r\nrun all risks in order to wipe off their recent disgrace.\r\n\r\nX.  My father, Suetonius Lenis [686], was in this battle, being at (424)\r\nthat time an angusticlavian tribune in the thirteenth legion.  He used\r\nfrequently to say, that Otho, before his advancement to the empire, had\r\nsuch an abhorrence of civil war, that once, upon hearing an account given\r\nat table of the death of Cassius and Brutus, he fell into a trembling,\r\nand that he never would have interfered with Galba, but that he was\r\nconfident of succeeding in his enterprise without a war.  Moreover, that\r\nhe was then encouraged to despise life by the example of a common\r\nsoldier, who bringing news of the defeat of the army, and finding that he\r\nmet with no credit, but was railed at for a liar and a coward, as if he\r\nhad run away from the field of battle, fell upon his sword at the\r\nemperor’s feet; upon the sight of which, my father said that Otho cried\r\nout, “that he would expose to no farther danger such brave men, who had\r\ndeserved so well at his hands.”  Advising therefore his brother, his\r\nbrother’s son, and the rest of his friends, to provide for their security\r\nin the best manner they could, after he had embraced and kissed them, he\r\nsent them away; and then withdrawing into a private room by himself, he\r\nwrote a letter of consolation to his sister, containing two sheets.  He\r\nlikewise sent another to Messalina, Nero’s widow, whom he had intended to\r\nmarry, committing to her the care of his relics and memory.  He then\r\nburnt all the letters which he had by him, to prevent the danger and\r\nmischief that might otherwise befall the writers from the conqueror.\r\nWhat ready money he had, he distributed among his domestics.\r\n\r\nXI.  And now being prepared, and just upon the point of dispatching\r\nhimself, he was induced to suspend the execution of his purpose by a\r\ngreat tumult which had broken out in the camp.  Finding that some of the\r\nsoldiers who were making off had been seized and detained as deserters,\r\n“Let us add,” said he, “this night to our life.”  These were his very\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nHe then gave orders that no violence should be offered to any one; and\r\nkeeping his chamber-door open until late at night, he allowed all who\r\npleased the liberty to come and see him.  At last, after quenching his\r\nthirst with a draught of cold water, he took up two poniards, and having\r\nexamined the points of both, put one of them under his pillow, and\r\nshutting his chamber-door, slept very soundly, until, awaking about break\r\nof day, he stabbed himself under the left pap.  Some persons bursting\r\ninto the room upon his first groan, he at one time covered, and at\r\nanother exposed his wound to the view of the bystanders, and thus life\r\nsoon ebbed away.  His funeral was hastily performed, according to his own\r\norder, in the thirty-eighth year of his age, and ninety-fifth day of his\r\nreign. [687]\r\n\r\nXII.  The person and appearance of Otho no way corresponded to the great\r\nspirit he displayed on this occasion; for he is said to have been of low\r\nstature, splay-footed, and bandy-legged.  He was, however, effeminately\r\nnice in the care of his person: the hair on his body he plucked out by\r\nthe roots; and because he was somewhat bald, he wore a kind of peruke, so\r\nexactly fitted to his head, that nobody could have known it for such.  He\r\nused to shave every day, and rub his face with soaked bread; the use of\r\nwhich he began when the down first appeared upon his chin, to prevent his\r\nhaving any beard.  It is said likewise that he celebrated publicly the\r\nsacred rites of Isis [688], clad in a linen garment, such as is used by\r\nthe worshippers of that goddess.  These circumstances, I imagine, caused\r\nthe world to wonder the more that his death was so little in character\r\nwith his life.  Many of the soldiers who were present, kissing and\r\nbedewing with their tears his hands and feet as he lay dead, and\r\ncelebrating him as “a most gallant man, and an incomparable emperor,”\r\n immediately put an end to their own lives upon the spot, not far from his\r\nfuneral pile.\r\n\r\n(426) Many of those likewise who were at a distance, upon hearing the\r\nnews of his death, in the anguish of their hearts, began fighting amongst\r\nthemselves, until they dispatched one another.  To conclude: the\r\ngenerality of mankind, though they hated him whilst living, yet highly\r\nextolled him after his death; insomuch that it was the common talk and\r\nopinion, “that Galba had been driven to destruction by his rival, not so\r\nmuch for the sake of reigning himself, as of restoring Rome to its\r\nancient liberty.”\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, in the fortune of this emperor, that he owed both his\r\nelevation and catastrophe to the inextricable embarrassments in which he\r\nwas involved; first, in respect of pecuniary circumstances, and next, of\r\npolitical.  He was not, so far as we can learn, a follower of any of the\r\nsects of philosophers which justified, and even recommended suicide, in\r\nparticular cases: yet he perpetrated that act with extraordinary coolness\r\nand resolution; and, what is no less remarkable, from the motive, as he\r\navowed, of public expediency only.  It was observed of him, for many\r\nyears after his death, that “none ever died like Otho.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAULUS VITELLIUS.\r\n\r\n(427)\r\n\r\nI.  Very different accounts are given of the origin of the Vitellian\r\nfamily.  Some describe it as ancient and noble, others as recent and\r\nobscure, nay, extremely mean.  I am inclined to think, that these several\r\nrepresentations have been made by the flatterers and detractors of\r\nVitellius, after he became emperor, unless the fortunes of the family\r\nvaried before.  There is extant a memoir addressed by Quintus Eulogius to\r\nQuintus Vitellius, quaestor to the Divine Augustus, in which it is said,\r\nthat the Vitellii were descended from Faunus, king of the aborigines, and\r\nVitellia [689], who was worshipped in many places as a goddess, and that\r\nthey reigned formerly over the whole of Latium: that all who were left of\r\nthe family removed out of the country of the Sabines to Rome, and were\r\nenrolled among the patricians: that some monuments of the family\r\ncontinued a long time; as the Vitellian Way, reaching from the Janiculum\r\nto the sea, and likewise a colony of that name, which, at a very remote\r\nperiod of time, they desired leave from the government to defend against\r\nthe Aequicolae [690], with a force raised by their own family only: also\r\nthat, in the time of the war with the Samnites, some of the Vitellii who\r\nwent with the troops levied for the security of Apulia, settled at\r\nNuceria [691], and their descendants, a long time afterwards, returned\r\nagain to Rome, and were admitted (428) into the patrician order.  On the\r\nother hand, the generality of writers say that the founder of the family\r\nwas a freedman.  Cassius Severus [692] and some others relate that he was\r\nlikewise a cobbler, whose son having made a considerable fortune by\r\nagencies and dealings in confiscated property, begot, by a common\r\nstrumpet, daughter of one Antiochus, a baker, a child, who afterwards\r\nbecame a Roman knight.  Of these different accounts the reader is left to\r\ntake his choice.\r\n\r\nII.  It is certain, however, that Publius Vitellius, of Nuceria, whether\r\nof an ancient family, or of low extraction, was a Roman knight, and a\r\nprocurator to Augustus.  He left behind him four sons, all men of very\r\nhigh station, who had the same cognomen, but the different praenomina of\r\nAulus, Quintus, Publius, and Lucius.  Aulus died in the enjoyment of the\r\nconsulship [693], which office he bore jointly with Domitius, the father\r\nof Nero Caesar.  He was elegant to excess in his manner of living, and\r\nnotorious for the vast expense of his entertainments.  Quintus was\r\ndeprived of his rank of senator, when, upon a motion made by Tiberius, a\r\nresolution passed to purge the senate of those who were in any respect\r\nnot duly qualified for that honour.  Publius, an intimate friend and\r\ncompanion of Germanicus, prosecuted his enemy and murderer, Cneius Piso,\r\nand procured sentence against him.  After he had been made proctor, being\r\narrested among the accomplices of Sejanus, and delivered into the hands\r\nof his brother to be confined in his house, he opened a vein with a\r\npenknife, intending to bleed himself to death.  He suffered, however, the\r\nwound to be bound up and cured, not so much from repenting the resolution\r\nhe had formed, as to comply with the importunity of his relations.  He\r\ndied afterwards a natural death during his confinement.  Lucius, after\r\nhis consulship [694], was made governor of Syria [695], and by his\r\npolitic management not only brought Artabanus, king of the Parthians, to\r\ngive him an interview, but to worship the standards of the Roman legions.\r\nHe afterwards filled two ordinary consulships [696], and also the\r\ncensorship [697] jointly with the emperor Claudius.  Whilst that (429)\r\nprince was absent upon his expedition into Britain [698], the care of the\r\nempire was committed to him, being a man of great integrity and industry.\r\nBut he lessened his character not a little, by his passionate fondness\r\nfor an abandoned freedwoman, with whose spittle, mixed with honey, he\r\nused to anoint his throat and jaws, by way of remedy for some complaint,\r\nnot privately nor seldom, but daily and publicly.  Being extravagantly\r\nprone to flattery, it was he who gave rise to the worship of Caius Caesar\r\nas a god, when, upon his return from Syria, he would not presume to\r\naccost him any otherwise than with his head covered, turning himself\r\nround, and then prostrating himself upon the earth.  And to leave no\r\nartifice untried to secure the favour of Claudius, who was entirely\r\ngoverned by his wives and freedmen, he requested as the greatest favour\r\nfrom Messalina, that she would be pleased to let him take off her shoes;\r\nwhich, when he had done, he took her right shoe, and wore it constantly\r\nbetwixt his toga and his tunic, and from time to time covered it with\r\nkisses.  He likewise worshipped golden images of Narcissus and Pallas\r\namong his household gods.  It was he, too, who, when Claudius exhibited\r\nthe secular games, in his compliments to him upon that occasion, used\r\nthis expression, “May you often do the same.”\r\n\r\nIII.  He died of palsy, the day after his seizure with it, leaving behind\r\nhim two sons, whom he had by a most excellent and respectable wife,\r\nSextilia.  He had lived to see them both consuls, the same year and\r\nduring the whole year also; the younger succeeding the elder for the last\r\nsix months [699].  The senate honoured him after his decease with a\r\nfuneral at the public expense, and with a statue in the Rostra, which had\r\nthis inscription upon the base: “One who was steadfast in his loyalty to\r\nhis prince.” The emperor Aulus Vitellius, the son of this Lucius, was born\r\nupon the eighth of the calends of October [24th September], or, as some\r\nsay, upon the seventh of the ides of September [7th September], in the\r\nconsulship of Drusus Caesar and Norbanus Flaccus [700].  His parents were\r\nso (430) terrified with the predictions of astrologers upon the\r\ncalculation of his nativity, that his father used his utmost endeavours\r\nto prevent his being sent governor into any of the provinces, whilst he\r\nwas alive.  His mother, upon his being sent to the legions [701], and\r\nalso upon his being proclaimed emperor, immediately lamented him as\r\nutterly ruined.  He spent his youth amongst the catamites of Tiberius at\r\nCapri, was himself constantly stigmatized with the name of Spintria\r\n[702], and was supposed to have been the occasion of his father’s\r\nadvancement, by consenting to gratify the emperor’s unnatural lust.\r\n\r\nIV.  In the subsequent part of his life, being still most scandalously\r\nvicious, he rose to great favour at court; being upon a very intimate\r\nfooting with Caius [Caligula], because of his fondness for\r\nchariot-driving, and with Claudius for his love of gaming.  But he was in\r\na still higher degree acceptable to Nero, as well on the same accounts, as\r\nfor a particular service which he rendered him.  When Nero presided in the\r\ngames instituted by himself, though he was extremely desirous to perform\r\namongst the harpers, yet his modesty would not permit him, notwithstanding\r\nthe people entreated much for it.  Upon his quitting the theatre,\r\nVitellius fetched him back again, pretending to represent the determined\r\nwishes of the people, and so afforded him the opportunity of yielding to\r\ntheir in treaties.\r\n\r\nV.  By the favour of these three princes, he was not only advanced to the\r\ngreat offices of state, but to the highest dignities of the sacred order;\r\nafter which he held the proconsulship of Africa, and had the\r\nsuperintendence of the public works, in which appointment his conduct,\r\nand, consequently, his reputation, were very different.  For he governed\r\nthe province with singular integrity during two years, in the latter of\r\nwhich he acted as deputy to his brother, who succeeded him.  But in his\r\noffice in the city, he was said to pillage the temples of their gifts and\r\nornaments, and to have exchanged brass and tin for gold and silver. [703]\r\n\r\nVI.  He took to wife Petronia, the daughter of a man of consular rank,\r\nand had by her a son named Petronius, who was blind of an eye.  The\r\nmother being willing to appoint this youth her heir, upon condition that\r\nhe should be released from his father’s authority, the latter discharged\r\nhim accordingly; but shortly after, as was believed, murdered him,\r\ncharging him with a design upon his life, and pretending that he had,\r\nfrom consciousness of his guilt, drank the poison he had prepared for his\r\nfather.  Soon afterwards, he married Galeria Fundana, the daughter of a\r\nman of pretorian rank, and had by her both sons and daughters.  Among the\r\nformer was one who had such a stammering in his speech, that he was\r\nlittle better than if he had been dumb.\r\n\r\nVII.  He was sent by Galba into Lower Germany [704], contrary to his\r\nexpectation.  It is supposed that he was assisted in procuring this\r\nappointment by the interest of Titus Junius, a man of great influence at\r\nthat time; whose friendship he had long before gained by favouring the\r\nsame set of charioteers with him in the Circensian games.  But Galba\r\nopenly declared that none were less to be feared than those who only\r\ncared for their bellies, and that even his enormous appetite must be\r\nsatisfied with the plenty of that province; so that it is evident he was\r\nselected for that government more out of contempt than kindness.  It is\r\ncertain, that when he was to set out, he had not money for the expenses\r\nof his journey; he being at that time so much straitened in his\r\ncircumstances, that he was obliged to put his wife and children, whom he\r\nleft at Rome, into a poor lodging which he hired for them, in order that\r\nhe might let his own house for the remainder of the year; and he pawned a\r\npearl taken from his mother’s ear-ring, to defray his expenses on the\r\nroad.  A crowd of creditors who were waiting to stop him, and amongst\r\nthem the people of Sineussa and Formia, whose taxes he had converted to\r\nhis own use, he eluded, by alarming them with the apprehension of false\r\naccusation.  He had, however, sued a certain freedman, who was clamorous\r\nin demanding a debt of him, under pretence that he had kicked him; which\r\naction he would not withdraw, until he had wrung from the freedman fifty\r\nthousand sesterces.  Upon his arrival in the province, the army, (432)\r\nwhich was disaffected to Galba, and ripe for insurrection, received him\r\nwith open arms, as if he had been sent them from heaven.  It was no small\r\nrecommendation to their favour, that he was the son of a man who had been\r\nthrice consul, was in the prime of life, and of an easy, prodigal\r\ndisposition.  This opinion, which had been long entertained of him,\r\nVitellius confirmed by some late practices; having kissed all the common\r\nsoldiers whom he met with upon the road, and been excessively complaisant\r\nin the inns and stables to the muleteers and travellers; asking them in a\r\nmorning, if they had got their breakfasts, and letting them see, by\r\nbelching, that he had eaten his.\r\n\r\nVIII.  After he had reached the camp, he denied no man any thing he asked\r\nfor, and pardoned all who lay under sentence for disgraceful conduct or\r\ndisorderly habits.  Before a month, therefore, had passed, without regard\r\nto the day or season, he was hurried by the soldiers out of his\r\nbed-chamber, although it was evening, and he in an undress, and\r\nunanimously saluted by the title of EMPEROR [705].  He was then carried\r\nround the most considerable towns in the neighbourhood, with the sword of\r\nthe Divine Julius in his hand; which had been taken by some person out of\r\nthe temple of Mars, and presented to him when he was first saluted.  Nor\r\ndid he return to the pretorium, until his dining-room was in flames from\r\nthe chimney’s taking fire.  Upon this accident, all being in\r\nconsternation, and considering it as an unlucky omen, he cried out,\r\n“Courage, boys! it shines brightly upon us.”  And this was all he said to\r\nthe soldiers.  The army of the Upper Province likewise, which had before\r\ndeclared against Galba for the senate, joining in the proceedings, he very\r\neagerly accepted the cognomen of Germanicus, offered him by the unanimous\r\nconsent of both armies, but deferred assuming that of Augustus, and\r\nrefused for ever that of Caesar.\r\n\r\nIX.  Intelligence of Galba’s death arriving soon after, when he had\r\nsettled his affairs in Germany he divided his troops into two bodies,\r\nintending to send one of them before him against Otho, and to follow with\r\nthe other himself.  The army he sent forward had a lucky omen; for,\r\nsuddenly, an eagle cams flying up to them on the right, and having\r\nhovered (433) round the standards, flew gently before them on their road.\r\nBut, on the other hand, when he began his own march, all the equestrian\r\nstatues, which were erected for him in several places, fell suddenly down\r\nwith their legs broken; and the laurel crown, which he had put on as\r\nemblematical of auspicious fortune, fell off his head into a river.  Soon\r\nafterwards, at Vienne [706], as he was upon the tribunal administering\r\njustice, a cock perched upon his shoulder, and afterwards upon his head.\r\nThe issue corresponded to these omens; for he was not able to keep the\r\nempire which had been secured for him by his lieutenants.\r\n\r\nX.  He heard of the victory at Bedriacum [707], and the death of Otho,\r\nwhilst he was yet in Gaul, and without the least hesitation, by a single\r\nproclamation, disbanded all the pretorian cohorts, as having, by their\r\nrepeated treasons, set a dangerous example to the rest of the army;\r\ncommanding them to deliver up their arms to his tribunes.  A hundred and\r\ntwenty of them, under whose hands he had found petitions presented to\r\nOtho, for rewards of their service in the murder of Galba, he besides\r\nordered to be sought out and punished.  So far his conduct deserved\r\napprobation, and was such as to afford hope of his becoming an excellent\r\nprince, had he not managed his other affairs in a way more corresponding\r\nwith his own disposition, and his former manner of life, than to the\r\nimperial dignity.  For, having begun his march, he rode through every\r\ncity in his route in a triumphal procession; and sailed down the rivers\r\nin ships, fitted out with the greatest elegance, and decorated with\r\nvarious kinds of crowns, amidst the most extravagant entertainments.\r\nSuch was the want of discipline, and the licentiousness both in his\r\nfamily and army, that, not satisfied with the provision every where made\r\nfor them at the public expense, they committed every kind of robbery and\r\ninsult upon the inhabitants, setting slaves at liberty as they pleased;\r\nand if any dared to make resistance, they dealt blows and abuse,\r\nfrequently wounds, and sometimes slaughter amongst them.  When he reached\r\nthe plains on which the battles (434) were fought [708], some of those\r\naround him being offended at the smell of the carcases which lay rotting\r\nupon the ground, he had the audacity to encourage them by a most\r\ndetestable remark, “That a dead enemy smelt not amiss, especially if he\r\nwere a fellow-citizen.”  To qualify, however, the offensiveness of the\r\nstench, he quaffed in public a goblet of wine, and with equal vanity and\r\ninsolence distributed a large quantity of it among his troops.  On his\r\nobserving a stone with an inscription upon it to the memory of Otho, he\r\nsaid, “It was a mausoleum good enough for such a prince.”  He also sent\r\nthe poniard, with which Otho killed himself, to the colony of Agrippina\r\n[709], to be dedicated to Mars.  Upon the Appenine hills he celebrated a\r\nBacchanalian feast.\r\n\r\nXI.  At last he entered the City with trumpets sounding, in his general’s\r\ncloak, and girded with his sword, amidst a display of standards and\r\nbanners; his attendants being all in the military habit, and the arms of\r\nthe soldiers unsheathed.  Acting more and more in open violation of all\r\nlaws, both divine and human, he assumed the office of Pontifex Maximus,\r\nupon the day of the defeat at the Allia [710]; ordered the magistrates to\r\nbe elected for ten years of office; and made himself consul for life.  To\r\nput it out of all doubt what model he intended to follow in his\r\ngovernment of the empire, he made his offerings to the shade of Nero in\r\nthe midst of the Campus Martius, and with a full assembly of the public\r\npriests attending him.  And at a solemn entertainment, he desired a\r\nharper who pleased the company much, to sing something in praise of\r\nDomitius; and upon his beginning some songs of Nero’s, he started up in\r\npresence of the whole assembly, and could not refrain from applauding\r\nhim, by clapping his hands.\r\n\r\nXII.  After such a commencement of his career, he conducted (435) his\r\naffairs, during the greater part of his reign, entirely by the advice and\r\ndirection of the vilest amongst the players and charioteers, and\r\nespecially his freedman Asiaticus.  This fellow had, when young, been\r\nengaged with him in a course of mutual and unnatural pollution, but,\r\nbeing at last quite tired of the occupation, ran away.  His master, some\r\ntime after, caught him at Puteoli, selling a liquor called Posca [711],\r\nand put him in chains, but soon released him, and retained him in his\r\nformer capacity.  Growing weary, however, of his rough and stubborn\r\ntemper, he sold him to a strolling fencing-master; after which, when the\r\nfellow was to have been brought up to play his part at the conclusion of\r\nan entertainment of gladiators, he suddenly carried him off, and at\r\nlength, upon his being advanced to the government of a province, gave him\r\nhis freedom.  The first day of his reign, he presented him with the gold\r\nrings at supper, though in the morning, when all about him requested that\r\nfavour in his behalf, he expressed the utmost abhorrence of putting so\r\ngreat a stain upon the equestrian order.\r\n\r\nXIII.  He was chiefly addicted to the vices of luxury and cruelty.  He\r\nalways made three meals a day, sometimes four: breakfast, dinner, and\r\nsupper, and a drunken revel after all.  This load of victuals he could\r\nwell enough bear, from a custom to which he had enured himself, of\r\nfrequently vomiting.  For these several meals he would make different\r\nappointments at the houses of his friends on the same day.  None ever\r\nentertained him at less expense than four hundred thousand sesterces\r\n[712].  The most famous was a set entertainment given him by his brother,\r\nat which, it is said, there were served up no less than two thousand\r\nchoice fishes, and seven thousand birds.  Yet even this supper he himself\r\noutdid, at a feast which he gave upon the first use of a dish which had\r\nbeen made for him, and which, for its extraordinary size, he called “The\r\nShield of Minerva.”  In this dish there were tossed up together the\r\nlivers of char-fish, the brains of pheasants and peacocks, with the\r\ntongues of flamingos, and the entrails of lampreys, which had been\r\nbrought in ships of war as far as (436) from the Carpathian Sea, and the\r\nSpanish Straits.  He was not only a man of an insatiable appetite, but\r\nwould gratify it likewise at unseasonable times, and with any garbage\r\nthat came in his way; so that, at a sacrifice, he would snatch from the\r\nfire flesh and cakes, and eat them upon the spot.  When he travelled, he\r\ndid the same at the inns upon the road, whether the meat was fresh\r\ndressed and hot, or what had been left the day before, and was\r\nhalf-eaten.\r\n\r\nXIV.  He delighted in the infliction of punishments, and even those which\r\nwere capital, without any distinction of persons or occasions.  Several\r\nnoblemen, his school-fellows and companions, invited by him to court, he\r\ntreated with such flattering caresses, as seemed to indicate an affection\r\nshort only of admitting them to share the honours of the imperial\r\ndignity; yet he put them all to death by some base means or other.  To\r\none he gave poison with his own hand, in a cup of cold water which he\r\ncalled for in a fever.  He scarcely spared one of all the usurers,\r\nnotaries, and publicans, who had ever demanded a debt of him at Rome, or\r\nany toll or custom upon the road.  One of these, while in the very act of\r\nsaluting him, he ordered for execution, but immediately sent for him\r\nback; upon which all about him applauding his clemency, he commanded him\r\nto be slain in his own presence, saying, “I have a mind to feed my eyes.”\r\n Two sons who interceded for their father, he ordered to be executed with\r\nhim.  A Roman knight, upon his being dragged away for execution, and\r\ncrying out to him, “You are my heir,” he desired to produce his will: and\r\nfinding that he had made his freedman joint heir with him, he commanded\r\nthat both he and the freedman should have their throats cut.  He put to\r\ndeath some of the common people for cursing aloud the blue party in the\r\nCircensian games; supposing it to be done in contempt of himself, and the\r\nexpectation of a revolution in the government.  There were no persons he\r\nwas more severe against than jugglers and astrologers; and as soon as any\r\none of them was informed against, he put him to death without the\r\nformality of a trial.  He was enraged against them, because, after his\r\nproclamation by which he commanded all astrologers to quit home, and\r\nItaly also, before the calends [the first] of October, a bill was\r\nimmediately posted about the city, with the following words:--“TAKE\r\nNOTICE: [713] The Chaldaeans also decree that Vitellius Germanicus shall\r\nbe no more, by the day of the said calends.”  He was even suspected of\r\nbeing accessary to his mother’s death, by forbidding sustenance to be\r\ngiven her when she was unwell; a German witch [714], whom he held to be\r\noracular, having told him, “That he would long reign in security if he\r\nsurvived his mother.”  But others say, that being quite weary of the\r\nstate of affairs, and apprehensive of the future, she obtained without\r\ndifficulty a dose of poison from her son.\r\n\r\nXV.  In the eighth month of his reign, the troops both in Moesia and\r\nPannonia revolted from him; as did likewise, of the armies beyond sea,\r\nthose in Judaea and Syria, some of which swore allegiance to Vespasian as\r\nemperor in his own presence, and others in his absence.  In order,\r\ntherefore, to secure the favour and affection of the people, Vitellius\r\nlavished on all around whatever he had it in his power to bestow, both\r\npublicly and privately, in the most extravagant manner.  He also levied\r\nsoldiers in the city, and promised all who enlisted as volunteers, not\r\nonly their discharge after the victory was gained, but all the rewards\r\ndue to veterans who had served their full time in the wars.  The enemy\r\nnow pressing forward both by sea and land, on one hand he opposed against\r\nthem his brother with a fleet, the new levies, and a body of gladiators,\r\nand in another quarter the troops and generals who were engaged at\r\nBedriacum.  But being beaten or betrayed in every direction, he agreed\r\nwith Flavius Sabinus, Vespasian’s brother, to abdicate, on condition of\r\nhaving his life spared, and a hundred millions of sesterces granted him;\r\nand he immediately, upon the palace-steps, publicly declared to a large\r\nbody of soldiers there assembled, “that he resigned the government, which\r\nhe had accepted reluctantly;” but they all remonstrating against it, he\r\ndeferred the conclusion of the treaty.  Next day, early in the morning,\r\nhe came down to the Forum in a very mean habit, and with many tears\r\nrepeated the (438) declaration from a writing which he held in his hand;\r\nbut the soldiers and people again interposing, and encouraging him not to\r\ngive way, but to rely on their zealous support, he recovered his courage,\r\nand forced Sabinus, with the rest of the Flavian party, who now thought\r\nthemselves secure, to retreat into the Capitol, where he destroyed them\r\nall by setting fire to the temple of Jupiter, whilst he beheld the\r\ncontest and the fire from Tiberius’s house [715], where he was feasting.\r\nNot long after, repenting of what he had done, and throwing the blame of\r\nit upon others, he called a meeting, and swore “that nothing was dearer\r\nto him than the public peace;” which oath he also obliged the rest to\r\ntake.  Then drawing a dagger from his side, he presented it first to the\r\nconsul, and, upon his refusing it, to the magistrates, and then to every\r\none of the senators; but none of them being willing to accept it, he went\r\naway, as if he meant to lay it up in the temple of Concord; but some\r\ncrying out to him, “You are Concord,” he came back again, and said that\r\nhe would not only keep his weapon, but for the future use the cognomen of\r\nConcord.\r\n\r\nXVI.  He advised the senate to send deputies, accompanied by the Vestal\r\nVirgins, to desire peace, or, at least, time for consultation.  The day\r\nafter, while he was waiting for an answer, he received intelligence by a\r\nscout, that the enemy was advancing.  Immediately, therefore, throwing\r\nhimself into a small litter, borne by hand, with only two attendants, a\r\nbaker and a cook, he privately withdrew to his father’s house, on the\r\nAventine hill, intending to escape thence into Campania.  But a\r\ngroundless report being circulated, that the enemy was willing to come to\r\nterms, he suffered himself to be carried back to the palace.  Finding,\r\nhowever, nobody there, and those who were with him stealing away, he\r\ngirded round his waist a belt full of gold pieces, and then ran into the\r\nporter’s lodge, tying the dog before the door, and piling up against it\r\nthe bed and bedding.\r\n\r\nXVII.  By this time the forerunners of the enemy’s army had broken into\r\nthe palace, and meeting with nobody, searched, as was natural, every\r\ncorner.  Being dragged by them out of his cell, and asked “who he was?”\r\n (for they did not recognize him), “and if he knew where Vitellius was?”\r\n he deceived them by a falsehood.  But at last being discovered, he begged\r\nhard to be detained in custody, even were it in a prison; pretending to\r\nhave something to say which concerned Vespasian’s security.\r\nNevertheless, he was dragged half-naked into the Forum, with his hands\r\ntied behind him, a rope about his neck, and his clothes torn, amidst the\r\nmost contemptuous abuse, both by word and deed, along the Via Sacra; his\r\nhead being held back by the hair, in the manner of condemned criminals,\r\nand the point of a sword put under his chin, that he might hold up his\r\nface to public view; some of the mob, meanwhile, pelting him with dung\r\nand mud, whilst others called him “an incendiary and glutton.”  They also\r\nupbraided him with the defects of his person, for he was monstrously\r\ntall, and had a face usually very red with hard-drinking, a large belly,\r\nand one thigh weak, occasioned by a chariot running against him, as he\r\nwas attending upon Caius [716], while he was driving.  At length, upon\r\nthe Scalae Gemoniae, he was tormented and put to death in lingering\r\ntortures, and then dragged by a hook into the Tiber.\r\n\r\nXVIII.  He perished with his brother and son [717], in the fifty-seventh\r\nyear of his age [718], and verified the prediction of those who, from the\r\nomen which happened to him at Vienne, as before related [719], foretold\r\nthat he would be made prisoner by some man of Gaul.  For he was seized by\r\nAntoninus Primus, a general of the adverse party, who was born at\r\nToulouse, and, when a boy, had the cognomen of Becco [720], which\r\nsignifies a cock’s beak.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n(440) After the extinction of the race of the Caesars, the possession of\r\nthe imperial power became extremely precarious; and great influence in\r\nthe army was the means which now invariably led to the throne.  The\r\nsoldiers having arrogated to themselves the right of nomination, they\r\neither unanimously elected one and the same person, or different parties\r\nsupporting the interests of their respective favourites, there arose\r\nbetween them a contention, which was usually determined by an appeal to\r\narms, and followed by the assassination of the unsuccessful competitor.\r\nVitellius, by being a parasite of all the emperors from Tiberius to Nero\r\ninclusively, had risen to a high military rank, by which, with a spirit\r\nof enterprise, and large promises to the soldiery, it was not difficult\r\nto snatch the reins of government, while they were yet fluctuating in the\r\nhands of Otho.  His ambition prompted to the attempt, and his boldness\r\nwas crowned with success.  In the service of the four preceding emperors,\r\nVitellius had imbibed the principal vices of them all: but what chiefly\r\ndistinguished him was extreme voraciousness, which, though he usually\r\npampered it with enormous luxury, could yet be gratified by the vilest\r\nand most offensive garbage.  The pusillanimity discovered by this emperor\r\nat his death, forms a striking contrast to the heroic behaviour of Otho.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nT. FLAVIUS VESPASIANUS AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\n(441)\r\n\r\nI.  The empire, which had been long thrown into a disturbed and unsetted\r\nstate, by the rebellion and violent death of its three last rulers, was\r\nat length restored to peace and security by the Flavian family, whose\r\ndescent was indeed obscure, and which boasted no ancestral honours; but\r\nthe public had no cause to regret its elevation; though it is\r\nacknowledged that Domitian met with the just reward of his avarice and\r\ncruelty.  Titus Flavius Petro, a townsman of Reate [721], whether a\r\ncenturion or an evocatus [722] of Pompey’s party in the civil war, is\r\nuncertain, fled out of the battle of Pharsalia and went home; where,\r\nhaving at last obtained his pardon and discharge, he became a collector\r\nof the money raised by public sales in the way of auction.  His son,\r\nsurnamed Sabinus, was never engaged in the military service, though some\r\nsay he was a centurion of the first order, and others, that whilst he\r\nheld that rank, he was discharged on account of his bad state of health:\r\nthis Sabinus, I say, was a publican, and received the tax of the fortieth\r\npenny in Asia.  And there were remaining, at the time of the advancement\r\nof the family, several statues, which had been erected to him by the\r\ncities of that province, with this inscription: “To the honest\r\nTax-farmer.” [723]  He afterwards turned usurer amongst the Helvetii, and\r\nthere died, leaving behind him his wife, Vespasia Pella, and two sons by\r\nher; the elder of whom, Sabinus, came to be prefect of the city, and the\r\nyounger, Vespasian, to be emperor.  Polla, descended of a good family, at\r\nNursia [724], had for her father Vespasius Pollio, thrice appointed (442)\r\nmilitary tribune, and at last prefect of the camp; and her brother was a\r\nsenator of praetorian dignity.  There is to this day, about six miles\r\nfrom Nursia, on the road to Spoletum, a place on the summit of a hill,\r\ncalled Vespasiae, where are several monuments of the Vespasii, a\r\nsufficient proof of the splendour and antiquity of the family.  I will\r\nnot deny that some have pretended to say, that Petro’s father was a\r\nnative of Gallia Transpadana [725], whose employment was to hire\r\nworkpeople who used to emigrate every year from the country of the Umbria\r\ninto that of the Sabines, to assist them in their husbandry [726]; but\r\nwho settled at last in the town of Reate, and there married.  But of this\r\nI have not been able to discover the least proof, upon the strictest\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nII.  Vespasian was born in the country of the Sabines, beyond Reate, in a\r\nlittle country-seat called Phalacrine, upon the fifth of the calends of\r\nDecember [27th November], in the evening, in the consulship of Quintus\r\nSulpicius Camerinus and Caius Poppaeus Sabinus, five years before the\r\ndeath of Augustus [727]; and was educated under the care of Tertulla, his\r\ngrandmother by the father’s side, upon an estate belonging to the family,\r\nat Cosa [728].  After his advancement to the empire, he used frequently\r\nto visit the place where he had spent his infancy; and the villa was\r\ncontinued in the same condition, that he might see every thing about him\r\njust as he had been used to do.  And he had so great a regard for the\r\nmemory of his grandmother, that, upon solemn occasions and festival days,\r\nhe constantly drank out of a silver cup which she had been accustomed to\r\nuse.  After assuming the manly habit, he had a long time a distaste for\r\nthe senatorian toga, though his brother had obtained it; nor could he be\r\npersuaded by any one but his mother to sue for that badge of honour.  She\r\nat length drove him to it, more by taunts and reproaches, than by her\r\nentreaties (443) and authority, calling him now and then, by way of\r\nreproach, his brother’s footman.  He served as military tribune in\r\nThrace.  When made quaestor, the province of Crete and Cyrene fell to him\r\nby lot.  He was candidate for the aedileship, and soon after for the\r\npraetorship, but met with a repulse in the former case; though at last,\r\nwith much difficulty, he came in sixth on the poll-books.  But the office\r\nof praetor he carried upon his first canvass, standing amongst the\r\nhighest at the poll.  Being incensed against the senate, and desirous to\r\ngain, by all possible means, the good graces of Caius [729], he obtained\r\nleave to exhibit extraordinary [730] games for the emperor’s victory in\r\nGermany, and advised them to increase the punishment of the conspirators\r\nagainst his life, by exposing their corpses unburied.  He likewise gave\r\nhim thanks in that august assembly for the honour of being admitted to\r\nhis table.\r\n\r\nIII.  Meanwhile, he married Flavia Domitilla, who had formerly been the\r\nmistress of Statilius Capella, a Roman knight of Sabrata in Africa, who\r\n[Domitilla] enjoyed Latin rights; and was soon after declared fully and\r\nfreely a citizen of Rome, on a trial before the court of Recovery,\r\nbrought by her father Flavius Liberalis, a native of Ferentum, but no\r\nmore than secretary to a quaestor.  By her he had the following children:\r\nTitus, Domitian, and Domitilla.  He outlived his wife and daughter, and\r\nlost them both before he became emperor.  After the death of his wife, he\r\nrenewed his union [731] with his former concubine Caenis, the freedwoman\r\nof Antonia, and also her amanuensis, and treated her, even after he was\r\nemperor, almost as if she had been his lawful wife. [732]\r\n\r\n(444) IV.  In the reign of Claudius, by the interest of Narcissus, he was\r\nsent to Germany, in command of a legion; whence being removed into\r\nBritain, he engaged the enemy in thirty several battles.  He reduced\r\nunder subjection to the Romans two very powerful tribes, and above twenty\r\ngreat towns, with the Isle of Wight, which lies close to the coast of\r\nBritain; partly under the command of Aulus Plautius, the consular\r\nlieutenant, and partly under Claudius himself [733].  For this success he\r\nreceived the triumphal ornaments, and in a short time after two\r\npriesthoods, besides the consulship, which he held during the two last\r\nmonths of the year [734].  The interval between that and his\r\nproconsulship he spent in leisure and retirement, for fear of Agrippina,\r\nwho still held great sway over her son, and hated all the friends of\r\nNarcissus, who was then dead.  Afterwards he got by lot the province of\r\nAfrica, which he governed with great reputation, excepting that once, in\r\nan insurrection at Adrumetum, he was pelted with turnips.  It is certain\r\nthat he returned thence nothing richer; for his credit was so low, that\r\nhe was obliged to mortgage his whole property to his brother, and was\r\nreduced to the necessity of dealing in mules, for the support of his\r\nrank; for which reason he was commonly called “the Muleteer.”  He is said\r\nlikewise to have been convicted of extorting from a young man of fashion\r\ntwo hundred thousand sesterces for procuring him the broad-stripe,\r\ncontrary to the wishes of his father, and was severely reprimanded for\r\nit.  While in attendance upon Nero in Achaia, he frequently withdrew from\r\nthe theatre while Nero was singing, and went to sleep if he remained,\r\nwhich gave so much (445) offence, that he was not only excluded from his\r\nsociety, but debarred the liberty of saluting him in public.  Upon this,\r\nhe retired to a small out-of-the-way town, where he lay skulking in\r\nconstant fear of his life, until a province, with an army, was offered\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nA firm persuasion had long prevailed through all the East [735], that it\r\nwas fated for the empire of the world, at that time, to devolve on some\r\nwho should go forth from Judaea.  This prediction referred to a Roman\r\nemperor, as the event shewed; but the Jews, applying it to themselves,\r\nbroke out into rebellion, and having defeated and slain their governor\r\n[736], routed the lieutenant of Syria [737], a man of consular rank, who\r\nwas advancing to his assistance, and took an eagle, the standard, of one\r\nof his legions.  As the suppression of this revolt appeared to require a\r\nstronger force and an active general, who might be safely trusted in an\r\naffair of so much importance, Vespasian was chosen in preference to all\r\nothers, both for his known activity, and on account of the obscurity of\r\nhis origin and name, being a person of whom (446) there could be not the\r\nleast jealousy.  Two legions, therefore, eight squadrons of horse, and\r\nten cohorts, being added to the former troops in Judaea, and, taking with\r\nhim his eldest son as lieutenant, as soon as he arrived in his province,\r\nhe turned the eyes of the neighbouring provinces upon him, by reforming\r\nimmediately the discipline of the camp, and engaging the enemy once or\r\ntwice with such resolution, that, in the attack of a castle [738], he had\r\nhis knee hurt by the stroke of a stone, and received several arrows in\r\nhis shield.\r\n\r\nV.  After the deaths of Nero and Galba, whilst Otho and Vitellius were\r\ncontending for the sovereignty, he entertained hopes of obtaining the\r\nempire, with the prospect of which he had long before flattered himself,\r\nfrom the following omens.  Upon an estate belonging to the Flavian\r\nfamily, in the neighbourhood of Rome, there was an old oak, sacred to\r\nMars, which, at the three several deliveries of Vespasia, put out each\r\ntime a new branch; evident intimations of the future fortune of each\r\nchild.  The first was but a slender one, which quickly withered away; and\r\naccordingly, the girl that was born did not live long.  The second became\r\nvigorous, which portended great good fortune; but the third grew like a\r\ntree.  His father, Sabinus, encouraged by these omens, which were\r\nconfirmed by the augurs, told his mother, “that her grandson would be\r\nemperor of Rome;” at which she laughed heartily, wondering, she said,\r\n“that her son should be in his dotage whilst she continued still in full\r\npossession of her faculties.”\r\n\r\nAfterwards in his aedileship, when Caius Caesar, being enraged at his not\r\ntaking care to have the streets kept clean, ordered the soldiers to fill\r\nthe bosom of his gown with dirt, some persons at that time construed it\r\ninto a sign that the government, being trampled under foot and deserted\r\nin some civil commotion, would fall under his protection, and as it were\r\ninto his lap.  Once, while he was at dinner, a strange dog, that wandered\r\nabout the streets, brought a man’s hand [739], and laid it under the\r\ntable.  And another time, while he was at supper, a plough-ox throwing\r\nthe yoke off his neck, broke into the room, and after he had frightened\r\naway all the attendants, (447) on a sudden, as if he was tired, fell down\r\nat his feet, as he lay still upon his couch, and hung down his neck.  A\r\ncypress-tree likewise, in a field belonging to the family, was torn up by\r\nthe roots, and laid flat upon the ground, when there was no violent wind;\r\nbut next day it rose again fresher and stronger than before.\r\n\r\nHe dreamt in Achaia that the good fortune of himself and his family would\r\nbegin when Nero had a tooth drawn; and it happened that the day after, a\r\nsurgeon coming into the hall, showed him a tooth which he had just\r\nextracted from Nero.  In Judaea, upon his consulting the oracle of the\r\ndivinity at Carmel [740], the answer was so encouraging as to assure him\r\nof success in anything he projected, however great or important it might\r\nbe.  And when Josephus [741], one of the noble prisoners, was put in\r\nchains, he confidently affirmed that he should be released in a very\r\nshort time by the same Vespasian, but he would be emperor first [742].\r\nSome omens were likewise mentioned in the news from Rome, and among\r\nothers, that Nero, towards the close of his days, was commanded in a\r\ndream to carry Jupiter’s sacred chariot out of the sanctuary where it\r\nstood, to Vespasian’s house, and conduct it thence into the circus.  Also\r\nnot long afterwards, as Galba was going to the election, in which he was\r\ncreated consul for the second time, a statue of the Divine Julius [743]\r\nturned towards the east.  And in the field of Bedriacum [744], before the\r\nbattle began, two eagles engaged in the sight of the army; and one of\r\nthem being beaten, a third came from the east, and drove away the\r\nconqueror.\r\n\r\n(448) VI.  He made, however, no attempt upon the sovereignty, though his\r\nfriends were very ready to support him, and even pressed him to the\r\nenterprise, until he was encouraged to it by the fortuitous aid of\r\npersons unknown to him and at a distance.  Two thousand men, drawn out of\r\nthree legions in the Moesian army, had been sent to the assistance of\r\nOtho.  While they were upon their march, news came that he had been\r\ndefeated, and had put an end to his life; notwithstanding which they\r\ncontinued their march as far as Aquileia, pretending that they gave no\r\ncredit to the report.  There, tempted by the opportunity which the\r\ndisorder of the times afforded them, they ravaged and plundered the\r\ncountry at discretion; until at length, fearing to be called to an\r\naccount on their return, and punished for it, they resolved upon choosing\r\nand creating an emperor.  “For they were no ways inferior,” they said,\r\n“to the army which made Galba emperor, nor to the pretorian troops which\r\nhad set up Otho, nor the army in Germany, to whom Vitellius owed his\r\nelevation.”  The names of all the consular lieutenants, therefore, being\r\ntaken into consideration, and one objecting to one, and another to\r\nanother, for various reasons; at last some of the third legion, which a\r\nlittle before Nero’s death had been removed out of Syria into Moesia,\r\nextolled Vespasian in high terms; and all the rest assenting, his name\r\nwas immediately inscribed on their standards.  The design was\r\nnevertheless quashed for a time, the troops being brought to submit to\r\nVitellius a little longer.\r\n\r\nHowever, the fact becoming known, Tiberius Alexander, governor of Egypt,\r\nfirst obliged the legions under his command to swear obedience to\r\nVespasian as their emperor, on the calends [the 1st] of July, which was\r\nobserved ever after as the day of his accession to the empire; and upon\r\nthe fifth of the ides of the same month [the 28th July], the army in\r\nJudaea, where he then was, also swore allegiance to him.  What\r\ncontributed greatly to forward the affair, was a copy of a letter,\r\nwhether real or counterfeit, which was circulated, and said to have been\r\nwritten by Otho before his decease to Vespasian, recommending to him in\r\nthe most urgent terms to avenge his death, and entreating him to come to\r\nthe aid of the commonwealth; as well as a report which was circulated,\r\nthat Vitellius, after his success against Otho, proposed to change the\r\nwinter quarters of the legions, and remove those in Germany to a less\r\n(449) hazardous station and a warmer climate.  Moreover, amongst the\r\ngovernors of provinces, Licinius Mucianus dropping the grudge arising\r\nfrom a jealousy of which he had hitherto made no secret, promised to join\r\nhim with the Syrian army, and, among the allied kings, Volugesus, king of\r\nthe Parthians, offered him a reinforcement of forty thousand archers.\r\n\r\nVII.  Having, therefore, entered on a civil war, and sent forward his\r\ngenerals and forces into Italy, he himself, in the meantime, passed over\r\nto Alexandria, to obtain possession of the key of Egypt [745].  Here\r\nhaving entered alone, without attendants, the temple of Serapis, to take\r\nthe auspices respecting the establishment of his power, and having done\r\nhis utmost to propitiate the deity, upon turning round, [his freedman]\r\nBasilides [746] appeared before him, and seemed to offer him the sacred\r\nleaves, chaplets, and cakes, according to the usage of the place,\r\nalthough no one had admitted him, and he had long laboured under a\r\nmuscular debility, which would hardly have allowed him to walk into the\r\ntemple; besides which, it was certain that at the very time he was far\r\naway.  Immediately after this, arrived letters with intelligence that\r\nVitellius’s troops had been defeated at Cremona, and he himself slain at\r\nRome.  Vespasian, the new emperor, having been raised unexpectedly from a\r\nlow estate, wanted something which might clothe him with divine majesty\r\nand authority.  This, likewise, was now added.  A poor man who was blind,\r\nand another who was lame, came both together before him, when he was\r\nseated on the tribunal, imploring him to heal them [747], and saying that\r\nthey were admonished (450) in a dream by the god Serapis to seek his aid,\r\nwho assured them that he would restore sight to the one by anointing his\r\neyes with his spittle, and give strength to the leg of the other, if he\r\nvouchsafed but to touch it with his heel.  At first he could scarcely\r\nbelieve that the thing would any how succeed, and therefore hesitated to\r\nventure on making the experiment.  At length, however, by the advice of\r\nhis friends, he made the attempt publicly, in the presence of the\r\nassembled multitudes, and it was crowned with success in both cases\r\n[748].  About the same time, at Tegea in Arcadia, by the direction (451)\r\nof some soothsayers, several vessels of ancient workmanship were dug out\r\nof a consecrated place, on which there was an effigy resembling\r\nVespasian.\r\n\r\nVIII.  Returning now to Rome, under these auspices, and with a great\r\nreputation, after enjoying a triumph for victories over the Jews, he\r\nadded eight consulships [749] to his former one.  He likewise assumed the\r\ncensorship, and made it his principal concern, during the whole of his\r\ngovernment, first to restore order in the state, which had been almost\r\nruined, and was in a tottering condition, and then to improve it.  The\r\nsoldiers, one part of them emboldened by victory, and the other smarting\r\nwith the disgrace of their defeat, had abandoned themselves to every\r\nspecies of licentiousness and insolence.  Nay, the provinces, too, and\r\nfree cities, and some kingdoms in alliance with Rome, were all in a\r\ndisturbed state.  He, therefore, disbanded many of Vitellius’s soldiers,\r\nand punished others; and so far was he from granting any extraordinary\r\nfavours to the sharers of his success, that it was late before he paid\r\nthe gratuities due to them by law.  That he might let slip no opportunity\r\nof reforming the discipline of the army, upon a young man’s coming much\r\nperfumed to return him thanks (452) for having appointed him to command a\r\nsquadron of horse, he turned away his head in disgust, and, giving him\r\nthis sharp reprimand, “I had rather you had smelt of garlic,” revoked his\r\ncommission.  When the men belonging to the fleet, who travelled by turns\r\nfrom Ostia and Puteoli to Rome, petitioned for an addition to their pay,\r\nunder the name of shoe-money, thinking that it would answer little\r\npurpose to send them away without a reply, he ordered them for the future\r\nto run barefooted; and so they have done ever since.  He deprived of\r\ntheir liberties, Achaia, Lycia, Rhodes, Byzantium, and Samos; and reduced\r\nthem into the form of provinces; Thrace, also, and Cilicia, as well as\r\nComagene, which until that time had been under the government of kings.\r\nHe stationed some legions in Cappadocia on account of the frequent\r\ninroads of the barbarians, and, instead of a Roman knight, appointed as\r\ngovernor of it a man of consular rank.  The ruins of houses which had\r\nbeen burnt down long before, being a great desight to the city, he gave\r\nleave to any one who would, to take possession of the void ground and\r\nbuild upon it, if the proprietors should hesitate to perform the work\r\nthemselves.  He resolved upon rebuilding the Capitol, and was the\r\nforemost to put his hand to clearing the ground of the rubbish, and\r\nremoved some of it upon his own shoulder.  And he undertook, likewise, to\r\nrestore the three thousand tables of brass which had been destroyed in\r\nthe fire which consumed the Capitol; searching in all quarters for copies\r\nof those curious and ancient records, in which were contained the decrees\r\nof the senate, almost from the building of the city, as well as the acts\r\nof the people, relative to alliances, treaties, and privileges granted to\r\nany person.\r\n\r\nIX.  He likewise erected several new public buildings, namely, the temple\r\nof Peace [750] near the Forum, that of Claudius on the (453) Coelian\r\nmount, which had been begun by Agrippina, but almost entirely demolished\r\nby Nero [751]; and an amphitheatre [752] in the middle of the city, upon\r\nfinding that Augustus had projected such a work.  He purified the\r\nsenatorian and equestrian orders, which had been much reduced by the\r\nhavoc made amongst them at several times, and was fallen into disrepute\r\nby neglect.  Having expelled the most unworthy, he chose in their room\r\nthe most honourable persons in Italy and the provinces.  And to let it be\r\nknown that those two orders differed not so much in privileges as in\r\ndignity, he declared publicly, when some altercation passed between a\r\nsenator and a Roman knight, “that senators ought not to be treated with\r\nscurrilous language, unless they were the aggressors, and then it was\r\nfair and lawful to return it.”\r\n\r\nX.  The business of the courts had prodigiously accumulated, partly from\r\nold law-suits which, on account of the interruption that had been given\r\nto the course of justice, still remained undecided, and partly from the\r\naccession of new suits arising out of the disorder of the times.  He,\r\ntherefore, chose commissioners by lot to provide for the restitution of\r\nwhat had been seized by violence during the war, and others with\r\nextraordinary jurisdiction to decide causes belonging to the centumviri,\r\nand reduce them to as small a number as possible, for the dispatch of\r\nwhich, otherwise, the lives of the litigants could scarcely allow\r\nsufficient time.\r\n\r\nXI.  Lust and luxury, from the licence which had long prevailed, had also\r\ngrown to an enormous height.  He, therefore, obtained a decree of the\r\nsenate, that a woman who formed an union with the slave of another\r\nperson, should be considered (454) a bondwoman herself; and that usurers\r\nshould not be allowed to take proceedings at law for the recovery of\r\nmoney lent to young men whilst they lived in their father’s family, not\r\neven after their fathers were dead.\r\n\r\nXII.  In other affairs, from the beginning to the end of his government,\r\nhe conducted himself with great moderation and clemency.  He was so far\r\nfrom dissembling the obscurity of his extraction, that he frequently made\r\nmention of it himself.  When some affected to trace his pedigree to the\r\nfounders of Reate, and a companion of Hercules [753], whose monument is\r\nstill to be seen on the Salarian road, he laughed at them for it.  And he\r\nwas so little fond of external and adventitious ornaments, that, on the\r\nday of his triumph [754], being quite tired of the length and tediousness\r\nof the procession, he could not forbear saying, “he was rightly served,\r\nfor having in his old age been so silly as to desire a triumph; as if it\r\nwas either due to his ancestors, or had ever been expected by himself.”\r\n Nor would he for a long time accept of the tribunitian authority, or the\r\ntitle of Father of his Country.  And in regard to the custom of searching\r\nthose who came to salute him, he dropped it even in the time of the civil\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nXIII.  He bore with great mildness the freedom used by his friends, the\r\nsatirical allusions of advocates, and the petulance of philosophers.\r\nLicinius Mucianus, who had been guilty of notorious acts of lewdness,\r\nbut, presuming upon his great services, treated him very rudely, he\r\nreproved only in private; and when complaining of his conduct to a common\r\nfriend of theirs, he concluded with these words, “However, I am a man.”\r\n Salvius Liberalis, in pleading the cause of a rich man under prosecution,\r\npresuming to say, “What is it to Caesar, if Hipparchus possesses a\r\nhundred millions of sesterces?” he commended him for it.  Demetrius, the\r\nCynic philosopher [755], (455) who had been sentenced to banishment,\r\nmeeting him on the road, and refusing to rise up or salute him, nay,\r\nsnarling at him in scurrilous language, he only called him a cur.\r\n\r\nXIV.  He was little disposed to keep up the memory of affronts or\r\nquarrels, nor did he harbour any resentment on account of them.  He made\r\na very splendid marriage for the daughter of his enemy Vitellius, and\r\ngave her, besides, a suitable fortune and equipage.  Being in a great\r\nconsternation after he was forbidden the court in the time of Nero, and\r\nasking those about him, what he should do? or, whither he should go? one\r\nof those whose office it was to introduce people to the emperor,\r\nthrusting him out, bid him go to Morbonia [756].  But when this same\r\nperson came afterwards to beg his pardon, he only vented his resentment\r\nin nearly the same words.  He was so far from being influenced by\r\nsuspicion or fear to seek the destruction of any one, that, when his\r\nfriends advised him to beware of Metius Pomposianus, because it was\r\ncommonly believed, on his nativity being cast, that he was destined by\r\nfate to the empire, he made him consul, promising for him, that he would\r\nnot forget the benefit conferred.\r\n\r\nXV.  It will scarcely be found, that so much as one innocent person\r\nsuffered in his reign, unless in his absence, and without his knowledge,\r\nor, at least, contrary to his inclination, and when he was imposed upon.\r\nAlthough Helvidius Priscus [757] was the only man who presumed to salute\r\nhim on his return from Syria by his private name of Vespasian, and, when\r\nhe came to be praetor, omitted any mark of honour to him, or even any\r\nmention of him in his edicts, yet he was not angry, until Helvidius\r\nproceeded to inveigh against him with the most scurrilous language.\r\n(456) Though he did indeed banish him, and afterwards ordered him to be\r\nput to death, yet he would gladly have saved him notwithstanding, and\r\naccordingly dispatched messengers to fetch back the executioners; and he\r\nwould have saved him, had he not been deceived by a false account\r\nbrought, that he had already perished.  He never rejoiced at the death of\r\nany man; nay he would shed tears, and sigh, at the just punishment of the\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\nXVI.  The only thing deservedly blameable in his character was his love\r\nof money.  For not satisfied with reviving the imposts which had been\r\nrepealed in the time of Galba, he imposed new and onerous taxes,\r\naugmented the tribute of the provinces, and doubled that of some of them.\r\nHe likewise openly engaged in a traffic, which is discreditable [758]\r\neven to a private individual, buying great quantities of goods, for the\r\npurpose of retailing them again to advantage.  Nay, he made no scruple of\r\nselling the great offices of the state to candidates, and pardons to\r\npersons under prosecution, whether they were innocent or guilty.  It is\r\nbelieved, that he advanced all the most rapacious amongst the procurators\r\nto higher offices, with the view of squeezing them after they had\r\nacquired great wealth.  He was commonly said, “to have used them as\r\nsponges,” because it was his practice, as we may say, to wet them when\r\ndry, and squeeze them when wet.  It is said that he was naturally\r\nextremely covetous, and was upbraided with it by an old herdsman of his,\r\nwho, upon the emperor’s refusing to enfranchise him gratis, which on his\r\nadvancement he humbly petitioned for, cried out, “That the fox changed\r\nhis hair, but not his nature.”  On the other hand, some are of opinion,\r\nthat he was urged to his rapacious proceedings by necessity, and the\r\nextreme poverty of the treasury and exchequer, of which he took public\r\nnotice in the beginning of his reign; declaring that “no less than four\r\nhundred thousand millions of sesterces were wanting to carry on the\r\ngovernment.”  This is the more likely to be true, because he applied to\r\nthe best purposes what he procured by bad means.\r\n\r\nXVII.  His liberality, however, to all ranks of people, was excessive.\r\nHe made up to several senators the estate required (457) by law to\r\nqualify them for that dignity; relieving likewise such men of consular\r\nrank as were poor, with a yearly allowance of five hundred thousand\r\nsesterces [759]; and rebuilt, in a better manner than before, several\r\ncities in different parts of the empire, which had been damaged by\r\nearthquakes or fires.\r\n\r\nXVIII.  He was a great encourager of learning and the liberal arts.  He\r\nfirst granted to the Latin and Greek professors of rhetoric the yearly\r\nstipend of a hundred thousand sesterces [760] each out of the exchequer.\r\nHe also bought the freedom of superior poets and artists [761], and gave\r\na noble gratuity to the restorer of the Coan of Venus [762], and to\r\nanother artist who repaired the Colossus [763].  Some one offering to\r\nconvey some immense columns into the Capitol at a small expense by a\r\nmechanical contrivance, he rewarded him very handsomely for his\r\ninvention, but would not accept his service, saying, “Suffer me to find\r\nmaintenance for the poor people.” [764]\r\n\r\nXIX.  In the games celebrated when the stage-scenery of (458) the theatre\r\nof Marcellus [765] was repaired, he restored the old musical\r\nentertainments.  He gave Apollinaris, the tragedian, four hundred\r\nthousand sesterces, and to Terpinus and Diodorus, the harpers, two\r\nhundred thousand; to some a hundred thousand; and the least he gave to\r\nany of the performers was forty thousand, besides many golden crowns.  He\r\nentertained company constantly at his table, and often in great state and\r\nvery sumptuously, in order to promote trade.  As in the Saturnalia he\r\nmade presents to the men which they were to carry away with them, so did\r\nhe to the women upon the calends of March [766]; notwithstanding which,\r\nhe could not wipe off the disrepute of his former stinginess.  The\r\nAlexandrians called him constantly Cybiosactes; a name which had been\r\ngiven to one of their kings who was sordidly avaricious.  Nay, at his\r\nfuneral, Favo, the principal mimic, personating him, and imitating, as\r\nactors do, both his manner of speaking and his gestures, asked aloud of\r\nthe procurators, “how much his funeral and the procession would cost?”\r\n And being answered “ten millions of sesterces,” he cried out, “give him\r\nbut a hundred thousand sesterces, and they might throw his body into the\r\nTiber, if they would.”\r\n\r\nXX.  He was broad-set, strong-limbed, and his features gave the idea of a\r\nman in the act of straining himself.  In consequence, one of the city\r\nwits, upon the emperor’s desiring him “to say something droll respecting\r\nhimself,” facetiously answered, “I will, when you have done relieving\r\nyour bowels.” [767]  He enjoyed a good state of health, though he used no\r\nother means to preserve it, than repeated friction, as much (459) as he\r\ncould bear, on his neck and other parts of his body, in the tennis-court\r\nattached to the baths, besides fasting one day in every month.\r\n\r\nXXI.  His method of life was commonly this.  After he became emperor, he\r\nused to rise very early, often before daybreak.  Having read over his\r\nletters, and the briefs of all the departments of the government offices;\r\nhe admitted his friends; and while they were paying him their\r\ncompliments, he would put on his own shoes, and dress himself with his\r\nown hands.  Then, after the dispatch of such business as was brought\r\nbefore him, he rode out, and afterwards retired to repose, lying on his\r\ncouch with one of his mistresses, of whom he kept several after the death\r\nof Caenis [768].  Coming out of his private apartments, he passed to the\r\nbath, and then entered the supper-room.  They say that he was never more\r\ngood-humoured and indulgent than at that time: and therefore his\r\nattendants always seized that opportunity, when they had any favour to\r\nask.\r\n\r\nXXII.  At supper, and, indeed, at other times, he was extremely free and\r\njocose.  For he had humour, but of a low kind, and he would sometimes use\r\nindecent language, such as is addressed to young girls about to be\r\nmarried.  Yet there are some things related of him not void of ingenious\r\npleasantry; amongst which are the following.  Being once reminded by\r\nMestrius Florus, that plaustra was a more proper expression than plostra,\r\nhe the next day saluted him by the name of Flaurus [769].  A certain lady\r\npretending to be desperately enamoured of him, he was prevailed upon to\r\nadmit her to his bed; and after he had gratified her desires, he gave her\r\n[770] four hundred (460) thousand sesterces.  When his steward desired to\r\nknow how he would have the sum entered in his accounts, he replied, “For\r\nVespasian’s being seduced.”\r\n\r\nXXIII.  He used Greek verses very wittily; speaking of a tall man, who\r\nhad enormous parts:\r\n\r\n    Makxi bibas, kradon dolichoskion enchos;\r\n    Still shaking, as he strode, his vast long spear.\r\n\r\nAnd of Cerylus, a freedman, who being very rich, had begun to pass\r\nhimself off as free-born, to elude the exchequer at his decease, and\r\nassumed the name of Laches, he said:\r\n\r\n               ----O Lachaes, Lachaes,\r\n    Epan apothanaes, authis ex archaes esae Kaerylos.\r\n\r\n    Ah, Laches, Laches! when thou art no more,\r\n    Thou’lt Cerylus be called, just as before.\r\n\r\nHe chiefly affected wit upon his own shameful means of raising money, in\r\norder to wipe off the odium by some joke, and turn it into ridicule.  One\r\nof his ministers, who was much in his favour, requesting of him a\r\nstewardship for some person, under pretence of his being his brother, he\r\ndeferred granting him his petition, and in the meantime sent for the\r\ncandidate, and having squeezed out of him as much money as he had agreed\r\nto give to his friend at court, he appointed him immediately to the\r\noffice.  The minister soon after renewing his application, “You must,”\r\n said he, “find another brother; for the one you adopted is in truth\r\nmine.”\r\n\r\nSuspecting once, during a journey, that his mule-driver had alighted to\r\nshoe his mules, only in order to have an opportunity for allowing a\r\nperson they met, who was engaged in a law-suit, to speak to him, he asked\r\nhim, “how much he got for shoeing his mules?” and insisted on having a\r\nshare of the profit.  When his son Titus blamed him for even laying a tax\r\nupon urine, he applied to his nose a piece of the money he received in\r\nthe first instalment, and asked him, “if it stunk?”  And he replying no,\r\n“And yet,” said he, “it is derived from urine.”\r\n\r\nSome deputies having come to acquaint him that a large statue, which\r\nwould cost a vast sum, was ordered to be erected for him at the public\r\nexpense, he told them to pay it down immediately, (461) holding out the\r\nhollow of his hand, and saying, “there was a base ready for the statue.”\r\n Not even when he was under the immediate apprehension and peril of death,\r\ncould he forbear jesting.  For when, among other prodigies, the mausoleum\r\nof the Caesars suddenly flew open, and a blazing star appeared in the\r\nheavens; one of the prodigies, he said, concerned Julia Calvina, who was\r\nof the family of Augustus [771]; and the other, the king of the\r\nParthians, who wore his hair long.  And when his distemper first seized\r\nhim, “I suppose,” said he, “I shall soon be a god.” [772]\r\n\r\nXXIV.  In his ninth consulship, being seized, while in Campania, with a\r\nslight indisposition, and immediately returning to the city, he soon\r\nafterwards went thence to Cutiliae [773], and his estates in the country\r\nabout Reate, where he used constantly to spend the summer.  Here, though\r\nhis disorder much increased, and he injured his bowels by too free use of\r\nthe cold waters, he nevertheless attended to the dispatch of business,\r\nand even gave audience to ambassadors in bed.  At last, being taken ill\r\nof a diarrhoea, to such a degree that he was ready to faint, he cried\r\nout, “An emperor ought to die standing upright.”  In endeavouring to\r\nrise, he died in the hands of those who were helping him up, upon the\r\neighth of the calends of July [24th June] [774], being sixty-nine years,\r\none month, and seven days old.\r\n\r\nXXV.  All are agreed that he had such confidence in the calculations on\r\nhis own nativity and that of his sons, that, after several conspiracies\r\nagainst him, he told the senate, that either his sons would succeed him,\r\nor nobody.  It is said likewise, that he once saw in a dream a balance in\r\nthe middle of the porch of the Palatine house exactly poised; in one\r\n(462) scale of which stood Claudius and Nero, in the other, himself and\r\nhis sons.  The event corresponded to the symbol; for the reigns of the\r\ntwo parties were precisely of the same duration. [775]\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nNeither consanguinity nor adoption, as formerly, but great influence in\r\nthe army having now become the road to the imperial throne, no person\r\ncould claim a better title to that elevation than Titus Flavius\r\nVespasian.  He had not only served with great reputation in the wars both\r\nin Britain and Judaea, but seemed as yet untainted with any vice which\r\ncould pervert his conduct in the civil administration of the empire.  It\r\nappears, however, that he was prompted more by the persuasion of friends,\r\nthan by his own ambition, to prosecute the attainment of the imperial\r\ndignity.  To render this enterprise more successful, recourse was had to\r\na new and peculiar artifice, which, while well accommodated to the\r\nsuperstitious credulity of the Romans, impressed them with an idea, that\r\nVespasian’s destiny to the throne was confirmed by supernatural\r\nindications.  But, after his elevation, we hear no more of his miraculous\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution of the war in Britain, which had been suspended for some\r\nyears, was resumed by Vespasian; and he sent thither Petilius Cerealis,\r\nwho by his bravery extended the limits of the Roman province.  Under\r\nJulius Frontinus, successor to that general, the invaders continued to\r\nmake farther progress in the reduction of the island: but the commander\r\nwho finally established the dominion of the Romans in Britain, was Julius\r\nAgricola, not less distinguished for his military achievements, than for\r\nhis prudent regard to the civil administration of the country.  He began\r\nhis operations with the conquest of North Wales, whence passing over into\r\nthe island of Anglesey, which had revolted since the time of Suetonius\r\nPaulinus, he again reduced it to subjection.  Then proceeding northwards\r\nwith his victorious army, he defeated the Britons in every engagement,\r\ntook possession of all the territories in the southern parts of the\r\nisland, and driving before him all who refused to submit to the Roman\r\narms, penetrated even into the forests and mountains of Caledonia.  He\r\ndefeated the natives under Galgacus, their leader, in a decisive battle;\r\nand fixing a line of garrisons between the friths of Clyde and Forth, he\r\nsecured the Roman province from the incursions of the people who occupied\r\nthe parts of the island (463) beyond that boundary.  Wherever he\r\nestablished the Roman power, he introduced laws and civilization amongst\r\nthe inhabitants, and employed every means of conciliating their\r\naffection, as well as of securing their obedience.\r\n\r\nThe war in Judaea, which had been commenced under the former reign, was\r\ncontinued in that of Vespasian; but he left the siege of Jerusalem to be\r\nconducted by his son Titus, who displayed great valour and military\r\ntalents in the prosecution of the enterprise.  After an obstinate defence\r\nby the Jews, that city, so much celebrated in the sacred writings, was\r\nfinally demolished, and the glorious temple itself, the admiration of the\r\nworld, reduced to ashes; contrary, however, to the will of Titus, who\r\nexerted his utmost efforts to extinguish the flames.\r\n\r\nThe manners of the Romans had now attained to an enormous pitch of\r\ndepravity, through the unbounded licentiousness of the tines; and, to the\r\nhonour of Vespasian, he discovered great zeal in his endeavours to effect\r\na national reformation.  Vigilant, active, and persevering, he was\r\nindefatigable in the management of public affairs, and rose in the winter\r\nbefore day-break, to give audience to his officers of state.  But if we\r\ngive credit to the whimsical imposition of a tax upon urine, we cannot\r\nentertain any high opinion, either of his talents as a financier, or of\r\nthe resources of the Roman empire.  By his encouragement of science, he\r\ndisplayed a liberality, of which there occurs no example under all the\r\npreceding emperors, since the time of Augustus.  Pliny the elder was now\r\nin the height of reputation, as well as in great favour with Vespasian;\r\nand it was probably owing not a little to the advice of that minister,\r\nthat the emperor showed himself so much the patron of literary men.  A\r\nwriter mentioned frequently by Pliny, and who lived in this reign, was\r\nLicinius Mucianus, a Roman knight: he treated of the history and\r\ngeography of the eastern countries.  Juvenal, who had begun his Satires\r\nseveral years before, continued to inveigh against the flagrant vices of\r\nthe times; but the only author whose writings we have to notice in the\r\npresent reign, is a poet of a different class.\r\n\r\nC. VALERIUS FLACCUS wrote a poem in eight books, on the Expedition of the\r\nArgonauts; a subject which, next to the wars of Thebes and Troy, was in\r\nancient times the most celebrated.  Of the life of this author,\r\nbiographers have transmitted no particulars; but we may place his birth\r\nin the reign of Tiberius, before all the writers who flourished in the\r\nAugustan age were extinct.  He enjoyed the rays of the setting sun which\r\nhad illumined that glorious period, and he discovers the efforts of an\r\nambition to recall its meridian splendour.  As the poem was left (464)\r\nincomplete by the death of the author, we can only judge imperfectly of\r\nthe conduct and general consistency of the fable: but the most difficult\r\npart having been executed, without any room for the censure of candid\r\ncriticism, we may presume that the sequel would have been finished with\r\nan equal claim to indulgence, if not to applause.  The traditional\r\nanecdotes relative to the Argonautic expedition are introduced with\r\npropriety, and embellished with the graces of poetical fiction.  In\r\ndescribing scenes of tenderness, this author is happily pathetic, and in\r\nthe heat of combat, proportionably animated.  His similes present the\r\nimagination with beautiful imagery, and not only illustrate, but give\r\nadditional force to the subject.  We find in Flaccus a few expressions\r\nnot countenanced by the authority of the most celebrated Latin writers.\r\nHis language, however, in general, is pure; but his words are perhaps not\r\nalways the best that might have been chosen.  The versification is\r\nelevated, though not uniformly harmonious; and there pervades the whole\r\npoem an epic dignity, which renders it superior to the production\r\nascribed to Orpheus, or to that of Apollonius, on the same subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITUS FLAVIUS VESPASIANUS AUGUSTUS.\r\n\r\n(465)\r\n\r\nI.  Titus, who had the same cognomen with his father, was the darling and\r\ndelight of mankind; so much did the natural genius, address, or good\r\nfortune he possessed tend to conciliate the favour of all.  This was,\r\nindeed, extremely difficult, after he became emperor, as before that\r\ntime, and even during the reign of his father, he lay under public odium\r\nand censure.  He was born upon the third of the calends of January, [30th\r\nDec.] in the year remarkable for the death of Caius [776], near the\r\nSeptizonium [777], in a mean house, and a very small and dark room, which\r\nstill exists, and is shown to the curious.\r\n\r\nII.  He was educated in the palace with Britannicus, and instructed in\r\nthe same branches of learning, and under the same masters.  During this\r\ntime, they say, that a physiognomist being introduced by Narcissus, the\r\nfreedman of Claudius, to examine the features of Britannicus [778],\r\npositively affirmed that he would never become emperor, but that Titus,\r\nwho stood by, would.  They were so familiar, that Titus being next him at\r\ntable, is thought to have tasted of the fatal potion which put an end to\r\nBritannicus’s life, and to have contracted from it a distemper which hung\r\nabout him a long time.  In remembrance of all these circumstances, he\r\nafterwards erected a golden statue of him in the Palatium, and dedicated\r\nto him an equestrian statue of ivory; attending it in the Circensian\r\nprocession, in which it is still carried to this day.\r\n\r\n(466) III.  While yet a boy, he was remarkable for his noble endowments\r\nboth of body and mind; and as he advanced in years, they became still\r\nmore conspicuous.  He had a fine person, combining an equal mixture of\r\nmajesty and grace; was very strong, though not tall, and somewhat\r\ncorpulent.  Gifted with an excellent memory, and a capacity for all the\r\narts of peace and war; he was a perfect master of the use of arms and\r\nriding; very ready in the Latin and Greek tongues, both in verse and\r\nprose; and such was the facility he possessed in both, that he would\r\nharangue and versify extempore.  Nor was he unacquainted with music, but\r\ncould both sing and play upon the harp sweetly and scientifically.  I\r\nhave likewise been informed by many persons, that he was remarkably quick\r\nin writing short-hand, would in merriment and jest engage with his\r\nsecretaries in the imitation of any hand-writing he saw, and often say,\r\n“that he was admirably qualified for forgery.”\r\n\r\nIV.  He filled with distinction the rank of a military tribune both in\r\nGermany and Britain, in which he conducted himself with the utmost\r\nactivity, and no less modesty and reputation; as appears evident from the\r\ngreat number of statues, with honourable inscriptions, erected to him in\r\nvarious parts of both those provinces.  After serving in the wars, he\r\nfrequented the courts of law, but with less assiduity than applause.\r\nAbout the same time, he married Arricidia, the daughter of Tertullus, who\r\nwas only a knight, but had formerly been prefect of the pretorian guards.\r\nAfter her decease, he married Marcia Furnilla, of a very noble family,\r\nbut afterwards divorced her, taking from her the daughter he had by her.\r\nUpon the expiration of his quaestorship, he was raised to the rank of\r\ncommander of a legion [779], and took the two strong cities of Tarichaea\r\nand Gamala, in Judaea; and having his horse killed under him in a battle,\r\nhe mounted another, whose rider he had encountered and slain.\r\n\r\nV.  Soon afterwards, when Galba came to be emperor, he was sent to\r\ncongratulate him, and turned the eyes of all people upon himself,\r\nwherever he came; it being the general opinion amongst them, that the\r\nemperor had sent for him with a design to adopt him for his son.  But\r\nfinding all things again in confusion, he turned back upon the road; and\r\ngoing to consult (467) the oracle of Venus at Paphos about his voyage, he\r\nreceived assurances of obtaining the empire for himself.  These hopes\r\nwere speedily strengthened, and being left to finish the reduction of\r\nJudaea, in the final assault of Jerusalem, he slew seven of its\r\ndefenders, with the like number of arrows, and took it upon his\r\ndaughter’s birth-day [780].  So great was the joy and attachment of the\r\nsoldiers, that, in their congratulations, they unanimously saluted him by\r\nthe title of Emperor [781]; and, upon his quitting the province soon\r\nafterwards, would needs have detained him, earnestly begging him, and\r\nthat not without threats, “either to stay, or take them all with him.”\r\n This occurrence gave rise to the suspicion of his being engaged in a\r\ndesign to rebel against his father, and claim for himself the government\r\nof the East; and the suspicion increased, when, on his way to Alexandria,\r\nhe wore a diadem at the consecration of the ox Apis at Memphis; and,\r\nthough he did it only in compliance with an ancient religious usage of\r\nthe country, yet there was some who put a bad construction upon it.\r\nMaking, therefore, what haste he could into Italy, he arrived first at\r\nRhegium, and sailing thence in a merchant ship to Puteoli, went to Rome\r\nwith all possible expedition.  Presenting himself unexpectedly to his\r\nfather, he said, by way of contradicting the strange reports raised\r\nconcerning him, “I am come, father, I am come.”\r\n\r\nVI.  From that time he constantly acted as colleague with his father,\r\nand, indeed, as regent of the empire.  He triumphed [782] (468) with his\r\nfather, bore jointly with him the office of censor [783], and was,\r\nbesides, his colleague not only in the tribunitian authority [784], but\r\nin seven consulships [785].  Taking upon himself the care and inspection\r\nof all offices, he dictated letters, wrote proclamations in his father’s\r\nname, and pronounced his speeches in the senate in place of the quaestor.\r\nHe likewise assumed the command of the pretorian guards, although no one\r\nbut a Roman knight had ever before been their prefect.  In this he\r\nconducted himself with great haughtiness and violence, taking off without\r\nscruple or delay all those he had most reason to suspect, after he had\r\nsecretly sent his emissaries into the theatres and camp, to demand, as if\r\nby general consent, that the suspected persons should be delivered up to\r\npunishment.  Among these, he invited to supper A. Caecina, a man of\r\nconsular rank, whom he ordered to be stabbed at his departure,\r\nimmediately after he had gone out of the room.  To this act, indeed, he\r\nwas provoked by an imminent danger; for he had discovered a writing under\r\nthe hand of Caecina, containing an account of a plot hatched among the\r\nsoldiers.  By these acts, though he provided for his future security, yet\r\nfor the present he so much incurred the hatred of the people, that\r\nscarcely ever any one came to the empire with a more odious character, or\r\nmore universally disliked.\r\n\r\nVII.  Besides his cruelty, he lay under the suspicion of giving (469) way\r\nto habits of luxury, as he often prolonged his revels till midnight with\r\nthe most riotous of his acquaintance.  Nor was he unsuspected of\r\nlewdness, on account of the swarms of catamites and eunuchs about him,\r\nand his well-known attachment to queen Berenice [786], who received from\r\nhim, as it is reported, a promise of marriage.  He was supposed, besides,\r\nto be of a rapacious disposition; for it is certain, that, in causes\r\nwhich came before his father, he used to offer his interest for sale, and\r\ntake bribes.  In short, people publicly expressed an unfavourable opinion\r\nof him, and said he would prove another Nero.  This prejudice, however,\r\nturned out in the end to his advantage, and enhanced his praises to the\r\nhighest pitch when he was found to possess no vicious propensities, but,\r\non the contrary, the noblest virtues.  His entertainments were agreeable\r\nrather than extravagant; and he surrounded himself with such excellent\r\nfriends, that the succeeding princes adopted them as most serviceable to\r\nthemselves and the state.  He immediately sent away Berenice from the\r\ncity, much against both their inclinations.  Some of his old eunuchs,\r\nthough such accomplished dancers, that they bore an uncontrollable sway\r\nupon the stage, he was so far from treating with any extraordinary\r\nkindness, that he would not so much as witness their performances in the\r\ncrowded theatre.  He violated no private right; (470) and if ever man\r\nrefrained from injustice, he did; nay, he would not accept of the\r\nallowable and customary offerings.  Yet, in munificence, he was inferior\r\nto none of the princes before him.  Having dedicated his amphitheatre\r\n[787], and built some warm baths [788] close by it with great expedition,\r\nhe entertained the people with most magnificent spectacles.  He likewise\r\nexhibited a naval fight in the old Naumachia, besides a combat of\r\ngladiators; and in one day brought into the theatre five thousand wild\r\nbeasts of all kinds. [789]\r\n\r\n(471) VIII.  He was by nature extremely benevolent; for whereas all the\r\nemperors after Tiberius, according to the example he had set them, would\r\nnot admit the grants made by former princes to be valid, unless they\r\nreceived their own sanction, he confirmed them all by one general edict,\r\nwithout waiting for any applications respecting them.  Of all who\r\npetitioned for any favour, he sent none away without hopes.  And when his\r\nministers represented to him that he promised more than he could perform,\r\nhe replied, “No one ought to go away downcast from an audience with his\r\nprince.”  Once at supper, reflecting that he had done nothing for any\r\nthat day, he broke out into that memorable and justly-admired saying, “My\r\nfriends, I have lost a day.” [790]  More particularly, he treated the\r\npeople on all occasions with so much courtesy, that, on his presenting\r\nthem with a show of gladiators, he declared, “He should manage it, not\r\naccording to his own fancy, but that of the spectators,” and did\r\naccordingly.  He denied them nothing, and very frankly encouraged them to\r\nask what they pleased.  Espousing the cause of the Thracian party among\r\nthe gladiators, he frequently joined in the popular demonstrations in\r\ntheir favour, but without compromising his dignity or doing injustice.\r\nTo omit no opportunity of acquiring popularity, he sometimes made use\r\nhimself of the baths he had erected, without excluding the common people.\r\nThere happened in his reign some dreadful accidents; an eruption of Mount\r\nVesuvius [791], in Campania, and a fire in Rome, which continued during\r\nthree days and three nights [792]; besides a plague, such as was scarcely\r\never known before.  Amidst these many great disasters, he not only\r\nmanifested the concern (472) which might be expected from a prince but\r\neven the affection of a father, for his people; one while comforting them\r\nby his proclamations, and another while relieving them to the utmost of\r\nhis power.  He chose by lot, from amongst the men of consular rank,\r\ncommissioners for repairing the losses in Campania.  The estates of those\r\nwho had perished by the eruption of Vesuvius, and who had left no heirs,\r\nhe applied to the repair of the ruined cities.  With regard to the public\r\nbuildings destroyed by fire in the City, he declared that nobody should\r\nbe a loser but himself.  Accordingly, he applied all the ornaments of his\r\npalaces to the decoration of the temples, and purposes of public utility,\r\nand appointed several men of the equestrian order to superintend the\r\nwork.  For the relief of the people during the plague, he employed, in\r\nthe way of sacrifice and medicine, all means both human and divine.\r\nAmongst the calamities of the times, were informers and their agents; a\r\ntribe of miscreants who had grown up under the licence of former reigns.\r\nThese he frequently ordered to be scourged or beaten with sticks in the\r\nForum, and then, after he had obliged them to pass through the\r\namphitheatre as a public spectacle, commanded them to be sold for slaves,\r\nor else banished them to some rocky islands.  And to discourage such\r\npractices for the future, amongst other things, he prohibited actions to\r\nbe successively brought under different laws for the same cause, or the\r\nstate of affairs of deceased persons to be inquired into after a certain\r\nnumber of years.\r\n\r\nIX.  Having declared that he accepted the office of Pontifex Maximus for\r\nthe purpose of preserving his hands undefiled, he faithfully adhered to\r\nhis promise.  For after that time he was neither directly nor indirectly\r\nconcerned in the death of any person, though he sometimes was justly\r\nirritated.  He swore “that he would perish himself, rather than prove the\r\ndestruction of any man.”  Two men of patrician rank being convicted of\r\naspiring to the empire, he only advised them to desist, saying, “that the\r\nsovereign power was disposed of by fate,” and promised them, that if\r\nthere was any thing else they desired of him, he would grant it.  He also\r\nimmediately sent messengers to the mother of one of them, who was at a\r\ngreat distance, and in deep anxiety about her son, to assure her of his\r\nsafety.  Nay, he not only invited them to sup with (473) him, but next\r\nday, at a show of gladiators, purposely placed them close by him; and\r\nhanded to them the arms of the combatants for his inspection.  It is said\r\nlikewise, that having had their nativities cast, he assured them, “that a\r\ngreat calamity was impending on both of them, but from another hand, and\r\nnot from his.”  Though his brother was continually plotting against him,\r\nalmost openly stirring up the armies to rebellion, and contriving to get\r\naway, yet he could not endure to put him to death, or to banish him from\r\nhis presence; nor did he treat him with less respect than before.  But\r\nfrom his first accession to the empire, he constantly declared him his\r\npartner in it, and that he should be his successor; begging of him\r\nsometimes in private, with tears in his eyes, “to return the affection he\r\nhad for him.”\r\n\r\nX.  Amidst all these favourable circumstances, he was cut off by an\r\nuntimely death, more to the loss of mankind than himself.  At the close\r\nof the public spectacles, he wept bitterly in the presence of the people,\r\nand then retired into the Sabine country [793], rather melancholy,\r\nbecause a victim had made its escape while he was sacrificing, and loud\r\nthunder had been heard while the atmosphere was serene.  At the first\r\nresting-place on the road, he was seized with a fever, and being carried\r\nforward in a litter, they say that he drew back the curtains, and looked\r\nup to heaven, complaining heavily, “that his life was taken from him,\r\nthough he had done nothing to deserve it; for there was no action of his\r\nthat he had occasion to repent of, but one.”  What that was, he neither\r\ndisclosed himself, nor is it easy for us to conjecture.  Some imagine\r\nthat he alluded to the connection which he had formerly had with his\r\nbrother’s wife.  But Domitia solemnly denied it on oath; which she would\r\nnever have done, had there been any truth in the report; nay, she would\r\ncertainly have gloried in it, as she was forward enough to boast of all\r\nher scandalous intrigues.\r\n\r\nXI.  He died in the same villa where his father had died (474) before\r\nhim, upon the Ides of September [the 13th of September]; two years, two\r\nmonths, and twenty days after he had succeeded his father; and in the\r\none-and-fortieth year of his age [794].  As soon as the news of his death\r\nwas published, all people mourned for him, as for the loss of some near\r\nrelative.  The senate assembled in haste, before they could be summoned\r\nby proclamation, and locking the doors of their house at first, but\r\nafterwards opening them, gave him such thanks, and heaped upon him such\r\npraises, now he was dead, as they never had done whilst he was alive and\r\npresent amongst them.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nTITUS FLAVIUS VESPASIAN, the younger, was the first prince who succeeded\r\nto the empire by hereditary right; and having constantly acted, after his\r\nreturn from Judaea, as colleague with his father in the administration,\r\nhe seemed to be as well qualified by experience as he was by abilities,\r\nfor conducting the affairs of the empire.  But with respect to his\r\nnatural disposition, and moral behaviour, the expectations entertained by\r\nthe public were not equally flattering.  He was immoderately addicted to\r\nluxury; he had betrayed a strong inclination to cruelty; and he lived in\r\nthe habitual practice of lewdness, no less unnatural than intemperate.\r\nBut, with a degree of virtuous resolution unexampled in history, he had\r\nno sooner taken into his hands the entire reins of government, than he\r\nrenounced every vicious attachment.  Instead of wallowing in luxury, as\r\nbefore, he became a model of temperance; instead of cruelty, he displayed\r\nthe strongest proofs of humanity and benevolence; and in the room of\r\nlewdness, he exhibited a transition to the most unblemished chastity and\r\nvirtue.  In a word, so sudden and great a change was never known in the\r\ncharacter of mortal; and he had the peculiar glory to receive the\r\nappellation of “the darling and delight of mankind.”\r\n\r\nUnder a prince of such a disposition, the government of the empire could\r\nnot but be conducted with the strictest regard to the public welfare.\r\nThe reform, which was begun in the late reign, he prosecuted with the\r\nmost ardent application; and, had he lived for a longer time, it is\r\nprobable that his authority and example would have produced the most\r\nbeneficial effects upon the manners of the Romans.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of this emperor, in the seventy-ninth year of (475) the\r\nChristian era, happened the first eruption of Mount Vesuvius, which has\r\never since been celebrated for its volcano.  Before this time, Vesuvius\r\nis spoken of, by ancient writers, as being covered with orchards and\r\nvineyards, and of which the middle was dry and barren.  The eruption was\r\naccompanied by an earthquake, which destroyed several cities of Campania,\r\nparticularly Pompeii and Herculaneum; while the lava, pouring down the\r\nmountain in torrents, overwhelmed, in various directions, the adjacent\r\nplains.  The burning ashes were carried not only over the neighbouring\r\ncountry, but as far as the shores of Egypt, Libya, and even Syria.\r\nAmongst those to whom this dreadful eruption proved fatal, was Pliny, the\r\ncelebrated naturalist, whose curiosity to examine the phenomenon led him\r\nso far within the verge of danger, that he could not afterwards escape.\r\n\r\nPLINY, surnamed the Elder, was born at Verona, of a noble family.  He\r\ndistinguished himself early by his military achievements in the German\r\nwar, received the dignity of an Augur, at Rome, and was afterwards\r\nappointed governor of Spain.  In every public character, he acquitted\r\nhimself with great reputation, and enjoyed the esteem of the several\r\nemperors under whom he lived.  The assiduity with which he applied\r\nhimself to the collection of information, either curious or useful,\r\nsurpasses all example.  From an early hour in the morning, until late at\r\nnight, he was almost constantly employed in discharging the duties of his\r\npublic station, in reading or hearing books read by his amanuensis, and\r\nin extracting from them whatever seemed worthy of notice.  Even during\r\nhis meals, and while travelling in his carriage upon business, he\r\nprosecuted with unremitting zeal and diligence his taste for enquiry and\r\ncompilation.  No man ever displayed so strong a persuasion of the value\r\nof time, or availed himself so industriously of it.  He considered every\r\nmoment as lost which was not employed in literary pursuits.  The books\r\nwhich he wrote, in consequence of this indefatigable exertion, were,\r\naccording to the account transmitted by his nephew, Pliny the younger,\r\nnumerous, and on various subjects.  The catalogue of them is as follows:\r\na book on Equestrian Archery, which discovered much skill in the art; the\r\nLife of Q. Pomponius Secundus; twenty books of the Wars of Germany; a\r\ncomplete treatise on the Education of an Orator, in six volumes; eight\r\nbooks of Doubtful Discourses, written in the latter part of the reign of\r\nNero, when every kind of moral discussion was attended with danger; with\r\na hundred and sixty volumes of remarks on the writings of the various\r\nauthors which he had perused.  For the last-mentioned production only,\r\nand before it was brought near to its accomplishment, we are told, that\r\nhe (476) was offered by Largius Licinius four hundred thousand sesterces,\r\namounting to upwards of three thousand two hundred pounds sterling; an\r\nenormous sum for the copyright of a book before the invention of\r\nprinting!  But the only surviving work of this voluminous author is his\r\nNatural History, in thirty-seven books, compiled from the various writers\r\nwho had treated of that extensive and interesting subject.\r\n\r\nIf we estimate this great work either by the authenticity of the\r\ninformation which it contains, or its utility in promoting the\r\nadvancement of arts and sciences, we should not consider it as an object\r\nof any extraordinary encomiums; but when we view it as a literary\r\nmonument, which displays the whole knowledge of the ancients, relative to\r\nNatural History, collected during a period of about seven hundred years,\r\nfrom the time of Thales the Milesian, it has a just claim to the\r\nattention of every speculative enquirer.  It is not surprising, that the\r\nprogress of the human mind, which, in moral science, after the first dawn\r\nof enquiry, was rapid both amongst the Greeks and Romans, should be slow\r\nin the improvement of such branches of knowledge as depended entirely on\r\nobservation and facts, which were peculiarly difficult of attainment.\r\nNatural knowledge can only be brought to perfection by the prosecution of\r\nenquiries in different climates, and by a communication of discoveries\r\namongst those by whom it is cultivated.  But neither could enquiries be\r\nprosecuted, nor discoveries communicated, with success, while the greater\r\npart of the world was involved in barbarism, while navigation was slow\r\nand limited, and the art of printing unknown.  The consideration of these\r\ncircumstances will afford sufficient apology for the imperfect state in\r\nwhich natural science existed amongst the ancients.  But we proceed to\r\ngive an abstract of their extent, as they appear in the compilation of\r\nPliny.\r\n\r\nThis work is divided into thirty-seven books; the first of which contains\r\nthe Preface, addressed to the emperor Vespasian, probably the father, to\r\nwhom the author pays high compliments.  The second book treats of the\r\nworld, the elements, and the stars.  In respect to the world, or rather\r\nthe universe, the author’s opinion is the same with that of several\r\nancient philosophers, that it is a Deity, uncreated, infinite, and\r\neternal.  Their notions, however, as might be expected, on a subject so\r\nincomprehensible, are vague, confused, and imperfect.  In a subsequent\r\nchapter of the same book, where the nature of the Deity is more\r\nparticularly considered, the author’s conceptions of infinite power are\r\nso inadequate, that, by way of consolation for the limited powers of man,\r\nhe observes that there are many things even beyond the power of the\r\nSupreme Being; such, for instance, as the annihilation of his own\r\nexistence; to which the author adds, the power (477) of rendering mortals\r\neternal, and of raising the dead.  It deserves to be remarked, that,\r\nthough a future state of rewards and punishments was maintained by the\r\nmost eminent among the ancient philosophers, the resurrection of the body\r\nwas a doctrine with which they were wholly unacquainted.\r\n\r\nThe author next treats of the planets, and the periods of their\r\nrespective revolutions; of the stars, comets, winds, thunder, lightning,\r\nand other natural phenomena, concerning all which he delivers the\r\nhypothetical notions maintained by the ancients, and mentions a variety\r\nof extraordinary incidents which had occurred in different parts of the\r\nworld.  The third book contains a general system of geography, which is\r\ncontinued through the fourth, fifth, and sixth books.  The seventh treats\r\nof conception, and the generation of the human species, with a number of\r\nmiscellaneous observations, unconnected with the general subject.  The\r\neighth treats of quadrupeds; the ninth, of aquatic animals; the tenth, of\r\nbirds; the eleventh, of insects and reptiles; the twelfth, of trees; the\r\nthirteenth, of ointments, and of trees which grow near the sea-coast; the\r\nfourteenth, of vines; the fifteenth, of fruit-trees; the sixteenth, of\r\nforest-trees; the seventeenth, of the cultivation of trees; the\r\neighteenth, of agriculture; the nineteenth, of the nature of lint, hemp,\r\nand similar productions; the twentieth, of the medicinal qualities of\r\nvegetables cultivated in gardens; the twenty-first, of flowers; the\r\ntwenty-second, of the properties of herbs; the twenty-third, of the\r\nmedicines yielded by cultivated trees; the twenty-fourth, of medicines\r\nderived from forest-trees; the twenty-fifth, of the properties of wild\r\nherbs, and the origin of their use; the twenty-sixth, of other remedies\r\nfor diseases, and of some new diseases; the twenty-seventh, of different\r\nkinds of herbs; the twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth, of\r\nmedicines procured from animals; the thirty-first and thirty-second, of\r\nmedicines obtained from aquatic animals, with some extraordinary facts\r\nrelative to the subject; the thirty-third, of the nature of metals; the\r\nthirty-fourth, of brass, iron, lead, and tin; the thirty-fifth, of\r\npictures, and observations relative to painting; the thirty-sixth, of the\r\nnature of stones and marbles; the thirty-seventh, of the origin of gems.\r\nTo the contents of each book, the author subjoins a list of the writers\r\nfrom whom his observations have been collected.\r\n\r\nOf Pliny’s talents as a writer, it might be deemed presumptuous to form a\r\ndecided opinion from his Natural History, which is avowedly a compilation\r\nfrom various authors, and executed with greater regard to the matter of\r\nthe work, than to the elegance of composition.  Making allowance,\r\nhowever, for a degree of credulity, common to the human mind in the early\r\nstage of physical (478) researches, he is far from being deficient in the\r\nessential qualifications of a writer of Natural History.  His\r\ndescriptions appear to be accurate, his observations precise, his\r\nnarrative is in general perspicuous, and he often illustrates his subject\r\nby a vivacity of thought, as well as by a happy turn of expression.  It\r\nhas been equally his endeavour to give novelty to stale disquisitions,\r\nand authority to new observations.  He has both removed the rust, and\r\ndispelled the obscurity, which enveloped the doctrines of many ancient\r\nnaturalists; but, with all his care and industry, he has exploded fewer\r\nerrors, and sanctioned a greater number of doubtful opinions, than was\r\nconsistent with the exercise of unprejudiced and severe investigation.\r\n\r\nPliny was fifty-six years of age at the time of his death; the manner of\r\nwhich is accurately related by his nephew, the elegant Pliny the Younger,\r\nin a letter to Tacitus, who entertained a design of writing the life of\r\nthe naturalist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTITUS FLAVIUS DOMITIANUS.\r\n\r\n(479)\r\n\r\nI.  Domitian was born upon the ninth of the calends of November [24th\r\nOctober] [795], when his father was consul elect, (being to enter upon\r\nhis office the month following,) in the sixth region of the city, at the\r\nPomegranate [796], in the house which he afterwards converted into a\r\ntemple of the Flavian family.  He is said to have spent the time of his\r\nyouth in so much want and infamy, that he had not one piece of plate\r\nbelonging to him; and it is well known, that Clodius Pollio, a man of\r\npretorian rank, against whom there is a poem of Nero’s extant, entitled\r\nLuscio, kept a note in his hand-writing, which he sometimes produced, in\r\nwhich Domitian made an assignation with him for the foulest purposes.\r\nSome, likewise, have said, that he prostituted himself to Nerva, who\r\nsucceeded him.  In the war with Vitellius, he fled into the Capitol with\r\nhis uncle Sabinus, and a part of the troops they had in the city [797].\r\nBut the enemy breaking in, and the temple being set on fire, he hid\r\nhimself all night with the sacristan; and next morning, assuming the\r\ndisguise of a worshipper of Isis, and mixing with the priests of that\r\nidle superstition, he got over the Tiber [798], with only one attendant,\r\nto the house of a woman who was the mother of one of his school-fellows,\r\nand lurked there so close, that, though the enemy, who were at his heels,\r\nsearched very strictly after him, they could not discover him.  At last,\r\nafter the success of his party, appearing in public, and being\r\nunanimously saluted by the title of Caesar, he assumed the office of\r\npraetor of the City, with consular authority, but in fact had nothing but\r\nthe name; for the jurisdiction he transferred to his next colleague.  He\r\nused, however, his absolute (480) power so licentiously, that even then\r\nhe plainly discovered what sort of prince he was likely to prove.  Not to\r\ngo into details, after he had made free with the wives of many men of\r\ndistinction, he took Domitia Longina from her husband, Aelias Lamia, and\r\nmarried her; and in one day disposed of above twenty offices in the city\r\nand the provinces; upon which Vespasian said several times, “he wondered\r\nhe did not send him a successor too.”\r\n\r\nII.  He likewise designed an expedition into Gaul and Germany [799],\r\nwithout the least necessity for it, and contrary to the advice of all his\r\nfather’s friends; and this he did only with the view of equalling his\r\nbrother in military achievements and glory.  But for this he was severely\r\nreprimanded, and that he might the more effectually be reminded of his\r\nage and position, was made to live with his father, and his litter had to\r\nfollow his father’s and brother’s carriage, as often as they went abroad;\r\nbut he attended them in their triumph for the conquest of Judaea [800],\r\nmounted on a white horse.  Of the six consulships which he held, only one\r\nwas ordinary; and that he obtained by the cession and interest of his\r\nbrother.  He greatly affected a modest behaviour, and, above all, a taste\r\nfor poetry; insomuch, that he rehearsed his performances in public,\r\nthough it was an art he had formerly little cultivated, and which he\r\nafterwards despised and abandoned.  Devoted, however, as he was at this\r\ntime to poetical pursuits, yet when Vologesus, king of the Parthians,\r\ndesired succours against the Alani, with one of Vespasian’s sons to\r\ncommand them, he laboured hard to procure for himself that appointment.\r\nBut the scheme proving abortive, he endeavoured by presents and promises\r\nto engage other kings of the East to make a similar request.  After his\r\nfather’s death, he was for some time in doubt, whether he should not\r\noffer the soldiers a donative double to that of his brother, and made no\r\nscruple of saying frequently, “that he had been left his partner in the\r\nempire, but that his father’s will had been fraudulently set aside.”\r\n From that time forward, he was constantly engaged in plots against his\r\nbrother, both publicly and privately; until, falling dangerously ill, he\r\nordered all his attendants to (481) leave him, under pretence of his\r\nbeing dead, before he really was so; and, at his decease, paid him no\r\nother honour than that of enrolling him amongst the gods; and he often,\r\nboth in speeches and edicts, carped at his memory by sneers and\r\ninsinuations.\r\n\r\nIII.  In the beginning of his reign, he used to spend daily an hour by\r\nhimself in private, during which time he did nothing else but catch\r\nflies, and stick them through the body with a sharp pin.  When some one\r\ntherefore inquired, “whether any one was with the emperor,” it was\r\nsignificantly answered by Vibius Crispus, “Not so much as a fly.”  Soon\r\nafter his advancement, his wife Domitia, by whom he had a son in his\r\nsecond consulship, and whom the year following he complimented with the\r\ntitle of Augusta, being desperately in love with Paris, the actor, he put\r\nher away; but within a short time afterwards, being unable to bear the\r\nseparation, he took her again, under pretence of complying with the\r\npeople’s importunity.  During some time, there was in his administration\r\na strange mixture of virtue and vice, until at last his virtues\r\nthemselves degenerated into vices; being, as we may reasonably conjecture\r\nconcerning his character, inclined to avarice through want, and to\r\ncruelty through fear.\r\n\r\nIV.  He frequently entertained the people with most magnificent and\r\ncostly shows, not only in the amphitheatre, but the circus; where,\r\nbesides the usual races with chariots drawn by two or four horses\r\na-breast, he exhibited the representation of an engagement between both\r\nhorse and foot, and a sea-fight in the amphitheatre.  The people were\r\nalso entertained with the chase of wild beasts and the combat of\r\ngladiators, even in the night-time, by torch-light.  Nor did men only\r\nfight in these spectacles, but women also.  He constantly attended at the\r\ngames given by the quaestors, which had been disused for some time, but\r\nwere revived by him; and upon those occasions, always gave the people the\r\nliberty of demanding two pair of gladiators out of his own school, who\r\nappeared last in court uniforms.  Whenever he attended the shows of\r\ngladiators, there stood at his feet a little boy dressed in scarlet, with\r\na prodigiously small head, with whom he used to talk very much, and\r\nsometimes seriously.  We are assured, that he was (482) overheard asking\r\nhim, “if he knew for what reason he had in the late appointment, made\r\nMetius Rufus governor of Egypt?”  He presented the people with naval\r\nfights, performed by fleets almost as numerous as those usually employed\r\nin real engagements; making a vast lake near the Tiber [801], and\r\nbuilding seats round it.  And he witnessed them himself during a very\r\nheavy rain.  He likewise celebrated the Secular games [802], reckoning\r\nnot from the year in which they had been exhibited by Claudius, but from\r\nthe time of Augustus’s celebration of them.  In these, upon the day of\r\nthe Circensian sports, in order to have a hundred races performed, he\r\nreduced each course from seven rounds to five.  He likewise instituted,\r\nin honour of Jupiter Capitolinus, a solemn contest in music to be\r\nperformed every five years; besides horse-racing and gymnastic exercises,\r\nwith more prizes than are at present allowed.  There was also a public\r\nperformance in elocution, both Greek and Latin and besides the musicians\r\nwho sung to the harp, there were others who played concerted pieces or\r\nsolos, without vocal accompaniment.  Young girls also ran races in the\r\nStadium, at which he presided in his sandals, dressed in a purple robe,\r\nmade after the Grecian fashion, and wearing upon his head a golden crown\r\nbearing the effigies of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva; with the flamen of\r\nJupiter, and the college of priests sitting by his side in the same\r\ndress; excepting only that their crowns had also his own image on them.\r\nHe celebrated also upon the Alban mount every year the festival of\r\nMinerva, for whom he had appointed a college of priests, out of which\r\nwere chosen by lot persons to preside as governors over the college; who\r\nwere obliged to entertain the people with extraordinary chases of\r\nwild-beasts, and stage-plays, besides contests for prizes in oratory and\r\npoetry.  He thrice bestowed upon the people a largess of three hundred\r\nsesterces each man; and, at a public show of gladiators, a very plentiful\r\nfeast.  At the festival of the Seven Hills [803], he distributed large\r\nhampers of provisions (483) to the senatorian and equestrian orders, and\r\nsmall baskets to the common people, and encouraged them to eat by setting\r\nthem the example.  The day after, he scattered among the people a variety\r\nof cakes and other delicacies to be scrambled for; and on the greater\r\npart of them falling amidst the seats of the crowd, he ordered five\r\nhundred tickets to be thrown into each range of benches belonging to the\r\nsenatorian and equestrian orders.\r\n\r\nV.  He rebuilt many noble edifices which had been destroyed by fire, and\r\namongst them the Capitol, which had been burnt down a second time [804];\r\nbut all the inscriptions were in his own name, without the least mention\r\nof the original founders.  He likewise erected a new temple in the\r\nCapitol to Jupiter Custos, and a forum, which is now called Nerva’s\r\n[805], as also the temple of the Flavian family [806], a stadium [807],\r\nan odeum [808], and a naumachia [809]; out of the stone dug from which,\r\nthe sides of the Circus Maximus, which had been burnt down, were rebuilt.\r\n\r\nVI.  He undertook several expeditions, some from choice, and some from\r\nnecessity.  That against the Catti [810] was unprovoked, but that against\r\nthe Sarmatians was necessary; an entire legion, with its commander,\r\nhaving been cut off by them.  He sent two expeditions against the\r\nDacians; the first upon the defeat of Oppius Sabinus, a man of consular\r\nrank; and (484) the other, upon that of Cornelius Fuscus, prefect of the\r\npretorian cohorts, to whom he had entrusted the conduct of that war.\r\nAfter several battles with the Catti and Daci, he celebrated a double\r\ntriumph.  But for his successes against the Sarmatians, he only bore in\r\nprocession the laurel crown to Jupiter Capitolinus.  The civil war, begun\r\nby Lucius Antonius, governor of Upper Germany, he quelled, without being\r\nobliged to be personally present at it, with remarkable good fortune.\r\nFor, at the very moment of joining battle, the Rhine suddenly thawing,\r\nthe troops of the barbarians which were ready to join L. Antonius, were\r\nprevented from crossing the river.  Of this victory he had notice by some\r\npresages, before the messengers who brought the news of it arrived.  For\r\nupon the very day the battle was fought, a splendid eagle spread its\r\nwings round his statue at Rome, making most joyful cries.  And shortly\r\nafter, a rumour became common, that Antonius was slain; nay, many\r\npositively affirmed, that they saw his head brought to the city.\r\n\r\nVII.  He made many innovations in common practices.  He abolished the\r\nSportula [811], and revived the old practice of regular suppers.  To the\r\nfour former parties in the Circensian games, he added two new, who were\r\ngold and scarlet.  He prohibited the players from acting in the theatre,\r\nbut permitted them the practice of their art in private houses.  He\r\nforbad the castration of males; and reduced the price of the eunuchs who\r\nwere still left in the hands of the dealers in slaves.  On the occasion\r\nof a great abundance of wine, accompanied by a scarcity of corn,\r\nsupposing that the tillage of the ground was neglected for the sake of\r\nattending too much to the cultivation of vineyards, he published a\r\nproclamation forbidding the planting of any new vines in Italy, and\r\nordering the vines in the provinces to be cut down, nowhere permitting\r\nmore than one half of them to remain [812].  But he did not persist in\r\nthe execution of this project.  Some of the greatest offices he conferred\r\nupon his freedmen and soldiers.  He forbad two legions to be quartered in\r\nthe same camp, and more than a thousand sesterces to be deposited by any\r\nsoldier with the standards; because it was thought that Lucius Antonius\r\nhad been encouraged in his late project by the large sum deposited in the\r\nmilitary chest by the two legions which he had in the same\r\nwinter-quarters.  He made an addition to the soldiers’ pay, of three\r\ngold pieces a year.\r\n\r\nVIII.  In the administration of justice he was diligent and assiduous;\r\nand frequently sat in the Forum out of course, to cancel the judgments of\r\nthe court of The One Hundred, which had been procured through favour, or\r\ninterest.  He occasionally cautioned the judges of the court of recovery\r\nto beware of being too ready to admit claims for freedom brought before\r\nthem.  He set a mark of infamy upon judges who were convicted of taking\r\nbribes, as well as upon their assessors.  He likewise instigated the\r\ntribunes of the people to prosecute a corrupt aedile for extortion, and\r\nto desire the senate to appoint judges for his trial.  He likewise took\r\nsuch effectual care in punishing magistrates of the city, and governors\r\nof provinces, guilty of malversation, that they never were at any time\r\nmore moderate or more just.  Most of these, since his reign, we have seen\r\nprosecuted for crimes of various kinds.  Having taken upon himself the\r\nreformation of the public manners, he restrained the licence of the\r\npopulace in sitting promiscuously with the knights in the theatre.\r\nScandalous libels, published to defame persons of rank, of either sex, he\r\nsuppressed, and inflicted upon their authors a mark of infamy.  He\r\nexpelled a man of quaestorian rank from the senate, for practising\r\nmimicry and dancing.  He debarred infamous women the use of litters; as\r\nalso the right of receiving legacies, or inheriting estates.  He struck\r\nout of the list of judges a Roman knight for taking again his wife whom\r\nhe had divorced and prosecuted for adultery.  He condemned several men of\r\nthe senatorian and equestrian orders, upon the Scantinian law [813].  The\r\nlewdness of the Vestal Virgins, which had been overlooked by his father\r\nand brother, he punished severely, but in different ways; viz. offences\r\ncommitted before his reign, with death, and those since its commencement,\r\naccording to ancient custom.  For to the two sisters called Ocellatae, he\r\ngave liberty to choose the mode of death which they preferred, and\r\nbanished (486) their paramours.  But Cornelia, the president of the\r\nVestals, who had formerly been acquitted upon a charge of incontinence,\r\nbeing a long time after again prosecuted and condemned, he ordered to be\r\nburied alive; and her gallants to be whipped to death with rods in the\r\nComitium; excepting only a man of praetorian rank, to whom, because he\r\nconfessed the fact, while the case was dubious, and it was not\r\nestablished against him, though the witnesses had been put to the\r\ntorture, he granted the favour of banishment.  And to preserve pure and\r\nundefiled the reverence due to the gods, he ordered the soldiers to\r\ndemolish a tomb, which one of his freedmen had erected for his son out of\r\nthe stones designed for the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and to sink in\r\nthe sea the bones and relics buried in it.\r\n\r\nIX.  Upon his first succeeding to power, he felt such an abhorrence for\r\nthe shedding of blood, that, before his father’s arrival in Rome, calling\r\nto mind the verse of Virgil,\r\n\r\n    Impia quam caesis gens est epulata juvencis, [814]\r\n\r\n    Ere impious man, restrain’d from blood in vain,\r\n    Began to feast on flesh of bullocks slain,\r\n\r\nhe designed to have published a proclamation, “to forbid the sacrifice of\r\noxen.”  Before his accession to the imperial authority, and during some\r\ntime afterwards, he scarcely ever gave the least grounds for being\r\nsuspected of covetousness or avarice; but, on the contrary, he often\r\nafforded proofs, not only of his justice, but his liberality.  To all\r\nabout him he was generous even to profusion, and recommended nothing more\r\nearnestly to them than to avoid doing anything mean.  He would not accept\r\nthe property left him by those who had children.  He also set aside a\r\nlegacy bequeathed by the will of Ruscus Caepio, who had ordered “his heir\r\nto make a present yearly to each of the senators upon their first\r\nassembling.”  He exonerated all those who had been under prosecution from\r\nthe treasury for above five years before; and would not suffer suits to\r\nbe renewed, unless it was done within a year, and on condition, that the\r\nprosecutor should be banished, if he could not make good his cause.  The\r\nsecretaries of the quaestors having engaged in trade, according to\r\ncustom, but contrary to (487) the Clodian law [815], he pardoned them for\r\nwhat was past.  Such portions of land as had been left when it was\r\ndivided amongst the veteran soldiers, he granted to the ancient\r\npossessors, as belonging to then by prescription.  He put a stop to false\r\nprosecutions in the exchequer, by severely punishing the prosecutors; and\r\nthis saying of his was much taken notice of “that a prince who does not\r\npunish informers, encourages them.”\r\n\r\nX.  But he did not long persevere in this course of clemency and justice,\r\nalthough he sooner fell into cruelty than into avarice.  He put to death\r\na scholar of Paris, the pantomimic [816], though a minor, and then sick,\r\nonly because, both in person and the practice of his art, he resembled\r\nhis master; as he did likewise Hermogenes of Tarsus for some oblique\r\nreflections in his History; crucifying, besides, the scribes who had\r\ncopied the work.  One who was master of a band of gladiators, happening\r\nto say, “that a Thrax was a match for a Marmillo [817], but not so for\r\nthe exhibitor of the games”, he ordered him to be dragged from the\r\nbenches into the arena, and exposed to the dogs, with this label upon\r\nhim, “A Parmularian [818] guilty of talking impiously.”  He put to death\r\nmany senators, and amongst them several men of consular rank.  In this\r\nnumber were, Civica Cerealis, when he was proconsul in Africa,\r\nSalvidienus Orfitus, and Acilius Glabrio in exile, under the pretence of\r\ntheir planning to revolt against him.  The rest he punished upon very\r\ntrivial occasions; as Aelius Lamia for some jocular expressions, which\r\nwere of old date, and perfectly harmless; because, upon his commending\r\nhis voice after he had taken his wife from him [819], he replied, “Alas!\r\nI hold my tongue.”  And when Titus advised him to take another wife, he\r\nanswered him thus: “What! have you a mind to marry?”  Salvius Cocceianus\r\nwas condemned to death for keeping the birth-day of his uncle Otho, the\r\nemperor: Metius Pomposianus, because he was commonly reported to have an\r\nimperial nativity [820], and to carry about with (488) him a map of the\r\nworld upon vellum, with the speeches of kings and generals extracted out\r\nof Titus Livius; and for giving his slaves the names of Mago and\r\nHannibal; Sallustius Lucullus, lieutenant in Britain, for suffering some\r\nlances of a new invention to be called “Lucullean;” and Junius Rusticus,\r\nfor publishing a treatise in praise of Paetus Thrasea and Helvidius\r\nPriscus, and calling them both “most upright men.”  Upon this occasion,\r\nhe likewise banished all the philosophers from the city and Italy.  He\r\nput to death the younger Helvidius, for writing a farce, in which, under\r\nthe character of Paris and Oenone, he reflected upon his having divorced\r\nhis wife; and also Flavius Sabinus, one of his cousins, because, upon his\r\nbeing chosen at the consular election to that office, the public crier\r\nhad, by a blunder, proclaimed him to the people not consul, but emperor.\r\nBecoming still more savage after his success in the civil war, he\r\nemployed the utmost industry to discover those of the adverse party who\r\nabsconded: many of them he racked with a new-invented torture, inserting\r\nfire through their private parts; and from some he cut off their hands.\r\nIt is certain, that only two of any note were pardoned, a tribune who\r\nwore the narrow stripe, and a centurion; who, to clear themselves from\r\nthe charge of being concerned in any rebellious project, proved\r\nthemselves to have been guilty of prostitution, and consequently\r\nincapable of exercising any influence either over the general or the\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nXI.  His cruelties were not only excessive, but subtle and unexpected.\r\nThe day before he crucified a collector of his rents, he sent for him\r\ninto his bed-chamber, made him sit down upon the bed by him, and sent him\r\naway well pleased, and, so far as could be inferred from his treatment,\r\nin a state of perfect security; having vouchsafed him the favour of a\r\nplate of meat from his own table.  When he was on the point of condemning\r\nto death Aretinus Clemens, a man of consular rank, and one of his friends\r\nand emissaries, he retained him about his person in the same or greater\r\nfavour than ever; until at last, as they were riding together in the same\r\nlitter, upon seeing the man who had informed against him, he said, “Are\r\nyou willing that we should hear this base slave tomorrow?”\r\n Contemptuously abusing the patience of men, he never pronounced a severe\r\nsentence without prefacing it (489) with words which gave hopes of mercy;\r\nso that, at last, there was not a more certain token of a fatal\r\nconclusion, than a mild commencement.  He brought before the senate some\r\npersona accused of treason, declaring, “that he should prove that day how\r\ndear he was to the senate;” and so influenced them, that they condemned\r\nthe accused to be punished according to the ancient usage [821].  Then,\r\nas if alarmed at the extreme severity of their punishment, to lessen the\r\nodiousness of the proceeding, he interposed in these words; for it is not\r\nforeign to the purpose to give them precisely as they were delivered:\r\n“Permit me, Conscript Fathers, so far to prevail upon your affection for\r\nme, however extraordinary the request may seem, as to grant the condemned\r\ncriminals the favour of dying in the manner they choose.  For by so\r\ndoing, ye will spare your own eyes, and the world will understand that I\r\ninterceded with the senate on their behalf.”\r\n\r\nXII.  Having exhausted the exchequer by the expense of his buildings and\r\npublic spectacles, with the augmentation of pay lately granted to the\r\ntroops, he made an attempt at the reduction of the army, in order to\r\nlessen the military charges.  But reflecting, that he should, by this\r\nmeasure, expose himself to the insults of the barbarians, while it would\r\nnot suffice to extricate him from his embarrassments, he had recourse to\r\nplundering his subjects by every mode of exaction.  The estates of the\r\nliving and the dead were sequestered upon any accusation, by whomsoever\r\npreferred.  The unsupported allegation of any one person, relative to a\r\nword or action construed to affect the dignity of the emperor, was\r\nsufficient.  Inheritances, to which he had not the slightest pretension,\r\nwere confiscated, if there was found so much as one person to say, he had\r\nheard from the deceased when living, “that he had made the emperor his\r\nheir.”  Besides the exactions from others, the poll-tax on the Jews was\r\nlevied with extreme rigour, both on those who lived after the manner of\r\nJews in the city, without publicly professing themselves to be such\r\n[822], and on those who, by (490) concealing their origin, avoided paying\r\nthe tribute imposed upon that people.  I remember, when I was a youth, to\r\nhave been present [823], when an old man, ninety years of age, had his\r\nperson exposed to view in a very crowded court, in order that, on\r\ninspection, the procurator might satisfy himself whether he was\r\ncircumcised. [824]\r\n\r\nFrom his earliest years Domitian was any thing but courteous, of a\r\nforward, assuming disposition, and extravagant both in his words and\r\nactions.  When Caenis, his father’s concubine, upon her return from\r\nIstria, offered him a kiss, as she had been used to do, he presented her\r\nhis hand to kiss.  Being indignant, that his brother’s son-in-law should\r\nbe waited on by servants dressed in white [825], he exclaimed,\r\n\r\n      ouk agathon polykoiraniae. [826]\r\n    Too many princes are not good.\r\n\r\nXIII.  After he became emperor, he had the assurance to boast in the\r\nsenate, “that he had bestowed the empire on his father and brother, and\r\nthey had restored it to him.”  And upon taking his wife again, after the\r\ndivorce, he declared by proclamation, “that he had recalled her to his\r\npulvinar.” [827]  He was not a little pleased too, at hearing the\r\nacclamations of the people in the amphitheatre on a day of festival, “All\r\nhappiness to our lord and lady.”  But when, during the celebration of the\r\nCapitoline trial of skill, the whole concourse of people entreated him\r\nwith one voice to restore Palfurius Sura to his place in the senate, from\r\nwhich he had been long before expelled--he having then carried away the\r\nprize of eloquence from all the orators who had contended for it,--he did\r\nnot vouchsafe to give them any answer, but only commanded silence to be\r\nproclaimed by the voice of the crier.  With equal arrogance, when he\r\ndictated the form of a letter to be used by his procurators, he began it\r\nthus: “Our lord and god commands so and so;” whence it became a rule that\r\nno one should (491) style him otherwise either in writing or speaking.\r\nHe suffered no statues to be erected for him in the Capitol, unless they\r\nwere of gold and silver, and of a certain weight.  He erected so many\r\nmagnificent gates and arches, surmounted by representations of chariots\r\ndrawn by four horses, and other triumphal ornaments, in different\r\nquarters of the city, that a wag inscribed on one of the arches the Greek\r\nword Axkei, “It is enough.” [828]  He filled the office of consul\r\nseventeen times, which no one had ever done before him, and for the seven\r\nmiddle occasions in successive years; but in scarcely any of them had he\r\nmore than the title; for he never continued in office beyond the calends\r\nof May [the 1st May], and for the most part only till the ides of January\r\n[13th January].  After his two triumphs, when he assumed the cognomen of\r\nGermanicus, he called the months of September and October, Germanicus and\r\nDomitian, after his own names, because he commenced his reign in the one,\r\nand was born in the other.\r\n\r\nXIV.  Becoming by these means universally feared and odious, he was at\r\nlast taken off by a conspiracy of his friends and favourite freedmen, in\r\nconcert with his wife [829].  He had long entertained a suspicion of the\r\nyear and day when he should die, and even of the very hour and manner of\r\nhis death; all which he had learned from the Chaldaeans, when he was a\r\nvery young man.  His father once at supper laughed at him for refusing to\r\neat some mushrooms, saying, that if he knew his fate, he would rather be\r\nafraid of the sword.  Being, therefore, in perpetual apprehension and\r\nanxiety, he was keenly alive to the slightest suspicions, insomuch that\r\nhe is thought to have withdrawn the edict ordering the destruction of the\r\nvines, chiefly because the copies of it which were dispersed had the\r\nfollowing lines written upon them:\r\n\r\n    Kaen me phagaes epi rizanomos epi kartophoraeso,\r\n        Osson epispeisai Kaisari thuomeno. [830]\r\n\r\n    Gnaw thou my root, yet shall my juice suffice\r\n    To pour on Caesar’s head in sacrifice.\r\n\r\n(492) It was from the same principle of fear, that he refused a new\r\nhonour, devised and offered him by the senate, though he was greedy of\r\nall such compliments.  It was this: “that as often as he held the\r\nconsulship, Roman knights, chosen by lot, should walk before him, clad in\r\nthe Trabea, with lances in their hands, amongst his lictors and\r\napparitors.”  As the time of the danger which he apprehended drew near,\r\nhe became daily more and more disturbed in mind; insomuch that he lined\r\nthe walls of the porticos in which he used to walk, with the stone called\r\nPhengites [831], by the reflection of which he could see every object\r\nbehind him.  He seldom gave an audience to persons in custody, unless in\r\nprivate, being alone, and he himself holding their chains in his hand.\r\nTo convince his domestics that the life of a master was not to be\r\nattempted upon any pretext, however plausible, he condemned to death\r\nEpaphroditus his secretary, because it was believed that he had assisted\r\nNero, in his extremity, to kill himself.\r\n\r\nXV.  His last victim was Flavius Clemens [832], his cousin-german, a man\r\nbelow contempt for his want of energy, whose sons, then of very tender\r\nage, he had avowedly destined for his successors, and, discarding their\r\nformer names, had ordered one to be called Vespasian, and the other\r\nDomitian.  Nevertheless, he suddenly put him to death upon some very\r\nslight suspicion [833], almost before he was well out of his consulship.\r\nBy this violent act he very much hastened his own destruction.  During\r\neight months together there was so much lightning at Rome, and such\r\naccounts of the phaenomenon were brought from other parts, that at last\r\nhe cried out, “Let him now strike whom he will.”  The Capitol was struck\r\nby lightning, as well as the temple of the Flavian family, with the\r\nPalatine-house, and his own bed-chamber.  The tablet also, inscribed upon\r\nthe base of his triumphal statue was carried away by the violence of the\r\nstorm, and fell upon a neighbouring (493) monument.  The tree which just\r\nbefore the advancement of Vespasian had been prostrated, and rose again\r\n[834], suddenly fell to the ground.  The goddess Fortune of Praeneste, to\r\nwhom it was his custom on new year’s day to commend the empire for the\r\nensuing year, and who had always given him a favourable reply, at last\r\nreturned him a melancholy answer, not without mention of blood.  He\r\ndreamt that Minerva, whom he worshipped even to a superstitious excess,\r\nwas withdrawing from her sanctuary, declaring she could protect him no\r\nlonger, because she was disarmed by Jupiter.  Nothing, however, so much\r\naffected him as an answer given by Ascletario, the astrologer, and his\r\nsubsequent fate.  This person had been informed against, and did not deny\r\nhis having predicted some future events, of which, from the principles of\r\nhis art, he confessed he had a foreknowledge.  Domitian asked him, what\r\nend he thought he should come to himself?  To which replying, “I shall in\r\na short time be torn to pieces by dogs,” he ordered him immediately to be\r\nslain, and, in order to demonstrate the vanity of his art, to be\r\ncarefully buried.  But during the preparations for executing this order,\r\nit happened that the funeral pile was blown down by a sudden storm, and\r\nthe body, half-burnt, was torn to pieces by dogs; which being observed by\r\nLatinus, the comic actor, as he chanced to pass that way, he told it,\r\namongst the other news of the day, to the emperor at supper.\r\n\r\nXVI.  The day before his death, he ordered some dates [835], served up at\r\ntable, to be kept till the next day, adding, “If I have the luck to use\r\nthem.”  And turning to those who were nearest him, he said, “To-morrow\r\nthe moon in Aquarius will be bloody instead of watery, and an event will\r\nhappen, which will be much talked of all the world over.”  About\r\nmidnight, he was so terrified that he leaped out of bed.  That morning he\r\ntried and passed sentence on a soothsayer sent from Germany, who being\r\nconsulted about the lightning that had lately (494) happened, predicted\r\nfrom it a change of government.  The blood running down his face as he\r\nscratched an ulcerous tumour on his forehead, he said, “Would this were\r\nall that is to befall me!”  Then, upon his asking the time of the day,\r\ninstead of five o’clock, which was the hour he dreaded, they purposely\r\ntold him it was six.  Overjoyed at this information; as if all danger\r\nwere now passed, and hastening to the bath, Parthenius, his chamberlain,\r\nstopped him, by saying that there was a person come to wait upon him\r\nabout a matter of great importance, which would admit of no delay.  Upon\r\nthis, ordering all persons to withdraw, he retired into his chamber, and\r\nwas there slain.\r\n\r\nXVII.  Concerning the contrivance and mode of his death, the common\r\naccount is this.  The conspirators being in some doubt when and where\r\nthey should attack him, whether while he was in the bath, or at supper,\r\nStephanus, a steward of Domitilla’s [836], then under prosecution for\r\ndefrauding his mistress, offered them his advice and assistance; and\r\nwrapping up his left arm, as if it was hurt, in wool and bandages for\r\nsome days, to prevent suspicion, at the hour appointed, he secreted a\r\ndagger in them.  Pretending then to make a discovery of a conspiracy, and\r\nbeing for that reason admitted, he presented to the emperor a memorial,\r\nand while he was reading it in great astonishment, stabbed him in the\r\ngroin.  But Domitian, though wounded, making resistance, Clodianus, one\r\nof his guards, Maximus, a freedman of Parthenius’s, Saturius, his\r\nprincipal chamberlain, with some gladiators, fell upon him, and stabbed\r\nhim in seven places.  A boy who had the charge of the Lares in his\r\nbed-chamber, and was then in attendance as usual, gave these further\r\nparticulars: that he was ordered by Domitian, upon receiving his first\r\nwound, to reach him a dagger which lay under his pillow, and call in his\r\ndomestics; but that he found nothing at the head of the bed, excepting\r\nthe hilt of a (495) poniard, and that all the doors were fastened: that\r\nthe emperor in the mean time got hold of Stephanus, and throwing him upon\r\nthe ground, struggled a long time with him; one while endeavouring to\r\nwrench the dagger from him, another while, though his fingers were\r\nmiserably mangled, to tear out his eyes.  He was slain upon the\r\nfourteenth of the calends of October [18th Sept.], in the forty-fifth\r\nyear of his age, and the fifteenth of his reign [837].  His corpse was\r\ncarried out upon a common bier by the public bearers, and buried by his\r\nnurse Phyllis, at his suburban villa on the Latin Way.  But she\r\nafterwards privately conveyed his remains to the temple of the Flavian\r\nfamily [838], and mingled them with the ashes of Julia, the daughter of\r\nTitus, whom she had also nursed.\r\n\r\nXVIII.  He was tall in stature, his face modest, and very ruddy; he had\r\nlarge eyes, but was dim-sighted; naturally graceful in his person,\r\nparticularly in his youth, excepting only that his toes were bent\r\nsomewhat inward, he was at last disfigured by baldness, corpulence, and\r\nthe slenderness of his legs, which were reduced by a long illness.  He\r\nwas so sensible how much the modesty of his countenance recommended him,\r\nthat he once made this boast to the senate, “Thus far you have approved\r\nboth of my disposition and my countenance.”  His baldness so much annoyed\r\nhim, that he considered it an affront to himself, if any other person was\r\nreproached with it, either in jest or in earnest; though in a small tract\r\nhe published, addressed to a friend, “concerning the preservation of the\r\nhair,” he uses for their mutual consolation the words following:\r\n\r\n    Ouch oraas oios kago kalos te megas te;\r\n    Seest thou my graceful mien, my stately form?\r\n\r\n“and yet the fate of my hair awaits me; however, I bear with fortitude\r\nthis loss of my hair while I am still young.  Remember that nothing is\r\nmore fascinating than beauty, but nothing of shorter duration.”\r\n\r\nXIX.  He so shrunk from undergoing fatigue, that he scarcely ever walked\r\nthrough the city on foot.  In his (496) expeditions and on a march, he\r\nseldom rode on horse-back; but was generally carried in a litter.  He had\r\nno inclination for the exercise of arms, but was very expert in the use\r\nof the bow.  Many persons have seen him often kill a hundred wild\r\nanimals, of various kinds, at his Alban retreat, and fix his arrows in\r\ntheir heads with such dexterity, that he could, in two shots, plant them,\r\nlike a pair of horns, in each.  He would sometimes direct his arrows\r\nagainst the hand of a boy standing at a distance, and expanded as a mark,\r\nwith such precision, that they all passed between the boy’s fingers,\r\nwithout hurting him.\r\n\r\nXX.  In the beginning of his reign, he gave up the study of the liberal\r\nsciences, though he took care to restore, at a vast expense, the\r\nlibraries which had been burnt down; collecting manuscripts from all\r\nparts, and sending scribes to Alexandria [839], either to copy or correct\r\nthem.  Yet he never gave himself the trouble of reading history or\r\npoetry, or of employing his pen even for his private purposes.  He\r\nperused nothing but the Commentaries and Acts of Tiberius Caesar.  His\r\nletters, speeches, and edicts, were all drawn up for him by others;\r\nthough he could converse with elegance, and sometimes expressed himself\r\nin memorable sentiments.  “I could wish,” said he once, “that I was but\r\nas handsome as Metius fancies himself to be.”  And of the head of some\r\none whose hair was partly reddish, and partly grey, he said, “that it was\r\nsnow sprinkled with mead.”\r\n\r\nXXI.  “The lot of princes,” he remarked, “was very miserable, for no one\r\nbelieved them when they discovered a conspiracy, until they were\r\nmurdered.”  When he had leisure, he amused himself with dice, even on\r\ndays that were not festivals, and in the morning.  He went to the bath\r\nearly, and made a plentiful dinner, insomuch that he seldom ate more at\r\nsupper than a Matian apple [840], to which he added a (497) draught of\r\nwine, out of a small flask.  He gave frequent and splendid\r\nentertainments, but they were soon over, for he never prolonged them\r\nafter sun-set, and indulged in no revel after.  For, till bed-time, he\r\ndid nothing else but walk by himself in private.\r\n\r\nXXII.  He was insatiable in his lusts, calling frequent commerce with\r\nwomen, as if it was a sort of exercise, klinopalaen, bed-wrestling; and\r\nit was reported that he plucked the hair from his concubines, and swam\r\nabout in company with the lowest prostitutes.  His brother’s daughter\r\n[841] was offered him in marriage when she was a virgin; but being at\r\nthat time enamoured of Domitia, he obstinately refused her.  Yet not long\r\nafterwards, when she was given to another, he was ready enough to debauch\r\nher, and that even while Titus was living.  But after she had lost both\r\nher father and her husband, he loved her most passionately, and without\r\ndisguise; insomuch that he was the occasion of her death, by obliging her\r\nto procure a miscarriage when she was with child by him.\r\n\r\nXXIII.  The people shewed little concern at his death, but the soldiers\r\nwere roused by it to great indignation, and immediately endeavoured to\r\nhave him ranked among the gods.  They were also ready to revenge his\r\nloss, if there had been any to take the lead.  However, they soon after\r\neffected it, by resolutely demanding the punishment of all those who had\r\nbeen concerned in his assassination.  On the other hand, the senate was\r\nso overjoyed, that they met in all haste, and in a full assembly reviled\r\nhis memory in the most bitter terms; ordering ladders to be brought in,\r\nand his shields and images to be pulled down before their eyes, and\r\ndashed in pieces upon the floor of the senate-house passing at the same\r\ntime a decree to obliterate his titles every where, and abolish all\r\nmemory of him.  A few months before he was slain, a raven on the Capitol\r\nuttered these words: “All will be well.”  Some person gave the following\r\ninterpretation of this prodigy:\r\n\r\n    (498) Nuper Tarpeio quae sedit culmine cornix.\r\n    “Est bene,” non potuit dicere; dixit, “Erit.”\r\n\r\n    Late croaked a raven from Tarpeia’s height,\r\n    “All is not yet, but shall be, right.”\r\n\r\nThey say likewise that Domitian dreamed that a golden hump grew out of\r\nthe back of his neck, which he considered as a certain sign of happy days\r\nfor the empire after him.  Such an auspicious change indeed shortly\r\nafterwards took place, through the justice and moderation of the\r\nsucceeding emperors.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nIf we view Domitian in the different lights in which he is represented,\r\nduring his lifetime and after his decease, his character and conduct\r\ndiscover a greater diversity than is commonly observed in the objects of\r\nhistorical detail.  But as posthumous character is always the most just,\r\nits decisive verdict affords the surest criterion by which this\r\nvariegated emperor must be estimated by impartial posterity.  According\r\nto this rule, it is beyond a doubt that his vices were more predominant\r\nthan his virtues: and when we follow him into his closet, for some time\r\nafter his accession, when he was thirty years of age, the frivolity of\r\nhis daily employment, in the killing of flies, exhibits an instance of\r\ndissipation, which surpasses all that has been recorded of his imperial\r\npredecessors.  The encouragement, however, which the first Vespasian had\r\nshown to literature, continued to operate during the present reign; and\r\nwe behold the first fruits of its auspicious influence in the valuable\r\ntreatise of QUINTILIAN.\r\n\r\nOf the life of this celebrated writer, little is known upon any authority\r\nthat has a title to much credit.  We learn, however, that he was the son\r\nof a lawyer in the service of some of the preceding emperors, and was\r\nborn in Rome, though in what consulship, or under what emperor, it is\r\nimpossible to determine.  He married a woman of a noble family, by whom\r\nhe had two sons.  The mother died in the flower of her age, and the sons,\r\nat the distance of some time from each other, when their father was\r\nadvanced in years.   The precise time of Quintilian’s own death is\r\nequally inauthenticated with that of his birth; nor can we rely upon an\r\nauthor of suspicious veracity, who says that he passed the latter part of\r\nhis life in a state of indigence which was alleviated by the liberality\r\nof his pupil, Pliny the Younger.  Quintilian opened a school of rhetoric\r\nat Rome, where he not only discharged that labourious employment with\r\ngreat applause, (499) during more than twenty years, but pleaded at the\r\nbar, and was the first who obtained a salary from the state, for\r\nexecuting the office of a public teacher.  He was also appointed by\r\nDomitian preceptor to the two young princes who were intended to succeed\r\nhim on the throne.\r\n\r\nAfter his retirement from the situation of a teacher, Quintilian devoted\r\nhis attention to the study of literature, and composed a treatise on the\r\nCauses of the Corruption of Eloquence.  At the earnest solicitation of\r\nhis friends, he was afterwards induced to undertake his Institutiones\r\nOratoriae, the most elaborate system of oratory extant in any language.\r\nThis work is divided into twelve books, in which the author treats with\r\ngreat precision of the qualities of a perfect orator; explaining not only\r\nthe fundamental principles of eloquence, as connected with the\r\nconstitution of the human mind, but pointing out, both by argument and\r\nobservation, the most successful method of exercising that admirable art,\r\nfor the accomplishment of its purpose.  So minutely, and upon so\r\nextensive a plan, has he prosecuted the subject, that he delineates the\r\neducation suitable to a perfect orator, from the stage of infancy in the\r\ncradle, to the consummation of rhetorical fame, in the pursuits of the\r\nbar, or those, in general, of any public assembly.  It is sufficient to\r\nsay, that in the execution of this elaborate work, Quintilian has called\r\nto the assistance of his own acute and comprehensive understanding, the\r\nprofound penetration of Aristotle, the exquisite graces of Cicero; all\r\nthe stores of observation, experience, and practice; and in a word, the\r\nwhole accumulated exertions of ancient genius on the subject of oratory.\r\n\r\nIt may justly be regarded as an extraordinary circumstance in the\r\nprogress of scientific improvement, that the endowments of a perfect\r\norator were never fully exhibited to the world, until it had become\r\ndangerous to exercise them for the important purposes for which they were\r\noriginally cultivated.  And it is no less remarkable, that, under all the\r\nviolence and caprice of imperial despotism which the Romans had now\r\nexperienced, their sensibility to the enjoyment of poetical compositions\r\nremained still unabated; as if it served to console the nation for the\r\nirretrievable loss of public liberty.  From this source of entertainment,\r\nthey reaped more pleasure during the present reign, than they had done\r\nsince the time of Augustus.  The poets of this period were Juvenal,\r\nStatius, and Martial.\r\n\r\nJUVENAL was born at Aquinum, but in what year is uncertain; though, from\r\nsome circumstances, it seems to have been in the reign of Augustus.  Some\r\nsay that he was the son of a freedman, (500) while others, without\r\nspecifying the condition of his father, relate only that he was brought\r\nup by a freedman.  He came at an early age to Rome, where he declaimed\r\nfor many years, and, pleaded causes in the forum with great applause; but\r\nat last he betook himself to the writing of satires, in which he acquired\r\ngreat fame.  One of the first, and the most constant object of is satire,\r\nwas the pantomime Paris, the great favourite of the emperor Nero, and\r\nafterwards of Domitian.  During the reign of the former of these\r\nemperors, no resentment was shown towards the poet; but he experienced\r\nnot the same impunity after the accession of the latter; when, to remove\r\nhim from the capital, he was sent as governor to the frontiers of Egypt,\r\nbut in reality, into an honourable exile.  According to some authors, he\r\ndied of chagrin in that province: but this is not authenticated, and\r\nseems to be a mistake: for in some of Martial’s epigrams, which appear to\r\nhave been written after the death of Domitian, Juvenal is spoken of as\r\nresiding at Rome.  It is said that he lived to upwards of eighty years of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nThe remaining compositions of this author are sixteen satires, all\r\nwritten against the dissipation and enormous vices which prevailed at\r\nRome in his time.  The various objects of animadversion are painted in\r\nthe strongest colours, and placed in the most conspicuous points of view.\r\nGiving loose reins to just and moral indignation, Juvenal is every where\r\nanimated, vehement, petulant, and incessantly acrimonious.  Disdaining\r\nthe more lenient modes of correction, or despairing of their success, he\r\nneither adopts the raillery of Horace, nor the derision of Persius, but\r\nprosecutes vice and folly with all the severity of sentiment, passion,\r\nand expression.  He sometimes exhibits a mixture of humour with his\r\ninvectives; but it is a humour which partakes more of virulent rage than\r\nof pleasantry; broad, hostile, but coarse, and rivalling in indelicacy\r\nthe profligate manners which it assails.  The satires of Juvenal abound\r\nin philosophical apophthegms; and, where they are not sullied by obscene\r\ndescription, are supported with a uniform air of virtuous elevation.\r\nAmidst all the intemperance of sarcasm, his numbers are harmonious.  Had\r\nhis zeal permitted him to direct the current of his impetuous genius into\r\nthe channel of ridicule, and endeavour to put to shame the vices and\r\nfollies of those licentious times, as much as he perhaps exasperated\r\nconviction rather than excited contrition, he would have carried satire\r\nto the highest possible pitch, both of literary excellence and moral\r\nutility.  With every abatement of attainable perfection, we hesitate not\r\nto place him at the head of this arduous department of poetry.\r\n\r\nOf STATIUS no farther particulars are preserved than that he (501) was\r\nborn at Naples; that his father’s name was Statius of Epirus, and his\r\nmother’s Agelina, and that he died about the end of the first century of\r\nthe Christian era.  Some have conjectured that he maintained himself by\r\nwriting for the stage, but of this there is no sufficient evidence; and\r\nif ever he composed dramatic productions, they have perished.  The works\r\nof Statius now extant, are two poems, viz. the Thebais and the Achilleis,\r\nbesides a collection, named Silvae.\r\n\r\nThe Thebais consists of twelve books, and the subject of it is the Theban\r\nwar, which happened 1236 years before the Christian era, in consequence\r\nof a dispute between Eteocles and Polynices, the sons of Oedipus and\r\nJocasta.  These brothers had entered into an agreement with each other to\r\nreign alternately for a year at a time; and Eteocles being the elder, got\r\nfirst possession of the throne.  This prince refusing to abdicate at the\r\nexpiration of the year, Polynices fled to Argos, where marrying Argia,\r\nthe daughter of Adrastus, king of that country, he procured the\r\nassistance of his father-in-law, to enforce the engagement stipulated\r\nwith his brother Eteocles.  The Argives marched under the command of\r\nseven able generals, who were to attack separately the seven gates of\r\nThebes.  After much blood had been spilt without any effect, it was at\r\nlast agreed between the two parties, that the brothers should determine\r\nthe dispute by single combat.  In the desperate engagement which ensued,\r\nthey both fell; and being burnt together upon the funeral pile, it is\r\nsaid that their ashes separated, as if actuated by the implacable\r\nresentment which they had borne to each other.\r\n\r\nIf we except the Aeneid, this is the only Latin production extant which\r\nis epic in its form; and it likewise approaches nearest in merit to that\r\ncelebrated poem, which Statius appears to have been ambitious of\r\nemulating.  In unity and greatness of action, the Thebais corresponds to\r\nthe laws of the Epopea; but the fable may be regarded as defective in\r\nsome particulars, which, however, arise more from the nature of the\r\nsubject, than from any fault of the poet.  The distinction of the hero is\r\nnot sufficiently prominent; and the poem possesses not those\r\ncircumstances which are requisite towards interesting the reader’s\r\naffections in the issue of the contest.  To this it may be added, that\r\nthe unnatural complexion of the incestuous progeny diffuses a kind of\r\ngloom which obscures the splendour of thought, and restrains the\r\nsympathetic indulgence of fancy to some of the boldest excursions of the\r\npoet.  For grandeur, however, and animation of sentiment and description,\r\nas well as for harmony of numbers, the Thebais is eminently conspicuous,\r\nand deserves to be held in a much higher degree of estimation than it has\r\n(502) generally obtained.  In the contrivance of some of the episodes,\r\nand frequently in the modes of expression, Statius keeps an attentive eye\r\nto the style of Virgil.  It is said that he was twelve years employed in\r\nthe composition of this poem; and we have his own authority for\r\naffirming, that he polished it with all the care and assiduity practised\r\nby the poets in the Augustan age:\r\n\r\n    Quippe, te fido monitore, nostra\r\n    Thebais, multa cruciata lima,\r\n    Tentat audaci fide Mantuanae\r\n        Gaudia famae.--Silvae, lib. iv. 7.\r\n\r\n    For, taught by you, with steadfast care\r\n    I trim my “Song of Thebes,” and dare\r\n    With generous rivalry to share\r\n        The glories of the Mantuan bard.\r\n\r\nThe Achilleis relates to the same hero who is celebrated by Homer in the\r\nIliad; but it is the previous history of Achilles, not his conduct in the\r\nTrojan war, which forms the subject of the poem of Statius.  While the\r\nyoung hero is under the care of the Centaur Chiron, Thetis makes a visit\r\nto the preceptor’s sequestered habitation, where, to save her son from\r\nthe fate which, it was predicted, would befall him at Troy, if he should\r\ngo to the siege of that place, she orders him to be dressed in the\r\ndisguise of a girl, and sent to live in the family of Lycomedes, king of\r\nScyros.  But as Troy could not be taken without the aid of Achilles,\r\nUlysses, accompanied by Diomede, is deputed by the Greeks to go to\r\nScyros, and bring him thence to the Grecian camp.  The artifice by which\r\nthe sagacious ambassador detected Achilles amongst his female companions,\r\nwas by placing before them various articles of merchandise, amongst which\r\nwas some armour.  Achilles no sooner perceived the latter, than he\r\neagerly seized a sword and shield, and manifesting the strongest emotions\r\nof heroic enthusiasm, discovered his sex.  After an affectionate parting\r\nwith Lycomedes’ daughter, Deidamia, whom he left pregnant of a son, he\r\nset sail with the Grecian chiefs, and, during the voyage, gives them an\r\naccount of the manner of his education with Chiron.\r\n\r\nThis poem consists of two books, in heroic measure, and is written with\r\ntaste and fancy.  Commentators are of opinion, that the Achilleis was\r\nleft incomplete by the death of the author; but this is extremely\r\nimprobable, from various circumstances, and appears to be founded only\r\nupon the word Hactenus, in the conclusion of the poem:\r\n\r\n    (503) Hactenus annorum, comites, elementa meorum\r\n    Et memini, et meminisse juvat: scit caetera mater.\r\n\r\n    Thus far, companions dear, with mindful joy I’ve told\r\n    My youthful deeds; the rest my mother can unfold.\r\n\r\nThat any consequential reference was intended by hactenus, seems to me\r\nplainly contradicted by the words which immediately follow, scit caetera\r\nmater.  Statius could not propose the giving any further account of\r\nAchilles’s life, because a general narrative of it had been given in the\r\nfirst book.  The voyage from Scyros to the Trojan coast, conducted with\r\nthe celerity which suited the purpose of the poet, admitted of no\r\nincidents which required description or recital: and after the voyagers\r\nhad reached the Grecian camp, it is reasonable to suppose, that the\r\naction of the Iliad immediately commenced.  But that Statius had no\r\ndesign of extending the plan of the Achilleis beyond this period, is\r\nexpressly declared in the exordium of the poem:\r\n\r\n    Magnanimum Aeaciden, formidatamque Tonanti\r\n    Progeniem, et patrio vetitam succedere coelo,\r\n    Diva, refer; quanquam acta viri multum inclyta cantu\r\n    Maeonio; sed plura vacant.  Nos ire per omnem\r\n    (Sic amor est) heroa velis, Scyroque latentem\r\n    Dulichia proferre tuba: nec in Hectore tracto\r\n    Sistere, sed tota juvenem deducere Troja.\r\n\r\n    Aid me, O goddess! while I sing of him,\r\n    Who shook the Thunderer’s throne, and, for his crime,\r\n    Was doomed to lose his birthright in the skies;\r\n    The great Aeacides.  Maeonian strains\r\n    Have made his mighty deeds their glorious theme;\r\n    Still much remains: be mine the pleasing task\r\n    To trace the future hero’s young career,\r\n    Not dragging Hector at his chariot wheels,\r\n    But while disguised in Scyros yet he lurked,\r\n    Till trumpet-stirred, he sprung to manly arms,\r\n    And sage Ulysses led him to the Trojan coast.\r\n\r\nThe Silvae is a collection of poems almost entirely in heroic verse,\r\ndivided into five books, and for the most part written extempore.\r\nStatius himself affirms, in his Dedication to Stella, that the production\r\nof none of them employed him more than two days; yet many of them consist\r\nof between one hundred and two hundred hexameter lines.  We meet with one\r\nof two hundred and sixteen lines; one, of two hundred and thirty-four;\r\none, of two hundred and sixty-two; and one of two hundred and\r\nseventy-seven; a rapidity of composition approaching to what Horace\r\nmentions of the poet Lucilius.  It is no small encomium to observe, that,\r\nconsidered as extemporaneous productions, (504) the meanest in the\r\ncollection is far from meriting censure, either in point of sentiment or\r\nexpression; and many of them contain passages which command our applause.\r\n\r\nThe poet MARTIAL, surnamed likewise Coquus, was born at Bilbilis, in\r\nSpain, of obscure parents.  At the age of twenty-one, he came to Rome,\r\nwhere he lived during five-and-thirty years under the emperors Galba,\r\nOtho, Vitellius, the two Vespasians, Domitian, Nerva, and the beginning\r\nof the reign of Trajan.  He was the panegyrist of several of those\r\nemperors, by whom he was liberally rewarded, raised to the Equestrian\r\norder, and promoted by Domitian to the tribuneship; but being treated\r\nwith coldness and neglect by Trajan, he returned to his native country,\r\nand, a few years after, ended his days, at the age of seventy-five.\r\n\r\nHe had lived at Rome in great splendour and affluence, as well as in high\r\nesteem for his poetical talents; but upon his return to Bilbilis, it is\r\nsaid that he experienced a great reverse of fortune, and was chiefly\r\nindebted for his support to the gratuitous benefactions of Pliny the\r\nYounger, whom he had extolled in some epigrams.\r\n\r\nThe poems of Martial consist of fourteen books, all written in the\r\nepigrammatic form, to which species of composition, introduced by the\r\nGreeks, he had a peculiar propensity.  Amidst such a multitude of verses,\r\non a variety of subjects, often composed extempore, and many of them,\r\nprobably, in the moments of fashionable dissipation, it is not surprising\r\nthat we find a large number unworthy the genius of the author.  Delicacy,\r\nand even decency, is often violated in the productions of Martial.\r\nGrasping at every thought which afforded even the shadow of ingenuity, he\r\ngave unlimited scope to the exercise of an active and fruitful\r\nimagination.  In respect to composition, he is likewise liable to\r\ncensure.  At one time he wearies, and at another tantalises the reader,\r\nwith the prolixity or ambiguity of his preambles.  His prelusive\r\nsentiments are sometimes far-fetched, and converge not with a natural\r\ndeclination into the focus of epigram.  In dispensing praise and censure,\r\nhe often seems to be governed more by prejudice or policy, than by\r\njustice and truth; and he is more constantly attentive to the production\r\nof wit, than to the improvement of morality.\r\n\r\nBut while we remark the blemishes and imperfections of this poet, we must\r\nacknowledge his extraordinary merits.  In composition he is, in general,\r\nelegant and correct; and where the subject is capable of connection with\r\nsentiment, his inventive ingenuity never fails to extract from it the\r\nessence of delight and surprise.  His fancy is prolific of beautiful\r\nimages, and his (505) judgment expert in arranging them to the greatest\r\nadvantage.  He bestows panegyric with inimitable grace, and satirises\r\nwith equal dexterity.  In a fund of Attic salt, he surpasses every other\r\nwriter; and though he seems to have at command all the varied stores of\r\ngall, he is not destitute of candour.  With almost every kind of\r\nversification he appears to be familiar; and notwithstanding a facility\r\nof temper, too accommodating, perhaps, on many occasions, to the\r\nlicentiousness of the times, we may venture from strong indications to\r\npronounce, that, as a moralist, his principles were virtuous.  It is\r\nobserved of this author, by Pliny the Younger, that, though his\r\ncompositions might, perhaps, not obtain immortality, he wrote as if they\r\nwould.  [Aeterna, quae scripsit, non erunt fortasse: ille tamen scripsit\r\ntanquam futura.]  The character which Martial gives of his epigrams, is\r\njust and comprehensive:\r\n\r\n    Sunt bona, sunt quaedam mediocria, sunt mala plura,\r\n    Quae legis: hic aliter non fit, Avite, liber.\r\n\r\n    Some are good, some indifferent, and some again still worse;\r\n    Such, Avitus, you will find is a common case with verse.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE TWELVE CAESARS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVES OF EMINENT GRAMMARIANS\r\n\r\n(506)\r\n\r\nI.  The science of grammar [842] was in ancient times far from being in\r\nvogue at Rome; indeed, it was of little use in a rude state of society,\r\nwhen the people were engaged in constant wars, and had not much time to\r\nbestow on the cultivation of the liberal arts [843].  At the outset, its\r\npretensions were very slender, for the earliest men of learning, who were\r\nboth poets and orators, may be considered as half-Greek: I speak of\r\nLivius [844] and Ennius [845], who are acknowledged to have taught both\r\nlanguages as well at Rome as in foreign parts [846].  But they (507) only\r\ntranslated from the Greek, and if they composed anything of their own in\r\nLatin, it was only from what they had before read.  For although there\r\nare those who say that this Ennius published two books, one on “Letters\r\nand Syllables,” and the other on “Metres,” Lucius Cotta has\r\nsatisfactorily proved that they are not the works of the poet Ennius, but\r\nof another writer of the same name, to whom also the treatise on the\r\n“Rules of Augury” is attributed.\r\n\r\nII.  Crates of Mallos [847], then, was, in our opinion, the first who\r\nintroduced the study of grammar at Rome.  He was cotemporary with\r\nAristarchus [848], and having been sent by king Attalus as envoy to the\r\nsenate in the interval between the second and third Punic wars [849],\r\nsoon after the death of Ennius [850], he had the misfortune to fall into\r\nan open sewer in the Palatine quarter of the city, and broke his leg.\r\nAfter which, during the whole period of his embassy and convalescence, he\r\ngave frequent lectures, taking much pains to instruct his hearers, and he\r\nhas left us an example well worthy of imitation.  It was so far followed,\r\nthat poems hitherto little known, the works either of deceased friends or\r\nother approved writers, were brought to light, and being read and\r\ncommented on, were explained to others.  Thus, Caius Octavius Lampadio\r\nedited the Punic War of Naevius [851], which having been written in one\r\nvolume without any break in the manuscript, he divided into seven books.\r\nAfter that, Quintus Vargonteius undertook the Annals of Ennius, which he\r\nread on certain fixed days to crowded audiences.  So Laelius Archelaus,\r\nand Vectius Philocomus, read and commented on the Satires of their friend\r\nLucilius [852], which Lenaeus Pompeius, a freedman, tells us he studied\r\nunder Archelaus; and Valerius Cato, under Philocomus.  Two others also\r\ntaught and promoted (508) grammar in various branches, namely, Lucius\r\nAelius Lanuvinus, the son-in-law of Quintus Aelius, and Servius Claudius,\r\nboth of whom were Roman knights, and men who rendered great services both\r\nto learning and the republic.\r\n\r\nIII.  Lucius Aelius had a double cognomen, for he was called Praeconius,\r\nbecause his father was a herald; Stilo, because he was in the habit of\r\ncomposing orations for most of the speakers of highest rank; indeed, he\r\nwas so strong a partisan of the nobles, that he accompanied Quintus\r\nMetellus Numidicus [853] in his exile.  Servius [854] having\r\nclandestinely obtained his father-in-law’s book before it was published,\r\nwas disowned for the fraud, which he took so much to heart, that,\r\noverwhelmed with shame and distress, he retired from Rome; and being\r\nseized with a fit of the gout, in his impatience, he applied a poisonous\r\nointment to his feet, which half-killed him, so that his lower limbs\r\nmortified while he was still alive.  After this, more attention was paid\r\nto the science of letters, and it grew in public estimation, insomuch,\r\nthat men of the highest rank did not hesitate in undertaking to write\r\nsomething on the subject; and it is related that sometimes there were no\r\nless than twenty celebrated scholars in Rome.  So high was the value, and\r\nso great were the rewards, of grammarians, that Lutatius Daphnides,\r\njocularly called “Pan’s herd” [855] by Lenaeus Melissus, was purchased by\r\nQuintus Catullus for two hundred thousand sesterces, and shortly\r\nafterwards made a freedman; and that Lucius Apuleius, who was taken into\r\nthe pay of Epicius Calvinus, a wealthy Roman knight, at the annual salary\r\nof ten thousand crowns, had many scholars.  Grammar also penetrated into\r\nthe provinces, and some of the most eminent amongst the learned taught it\r\nin foreign parts, particularly in Gallia Togata.  In the number of these,\r\nwe may reckon Octavius (509) Teucer, Siscennius Jacchus, and Oppius Cares\r\n[856], who persisted in teaching to a most advanced period of his life,\r\nat a time when he was not only unable to walk, but his sight failed.\r\n\r\nIV.  The appellation of grammarian was borrowed from the Greeks; but at\r\nfirst, the Latins called such persons literati.  Cornelius Nepos, also,\r\nin his book, where he draws a distinction between a literate and a\r\nphilologist, says that in common phrase, those are properly called\r\nliterati who are skilled in speaking or writing with care or accuracy,\r\nand those more especially deserve the name who translated the poets, and\r\nwere called grammarians by the Greeks.  It appears that they were named\r\nliterators by Messala Corvinus, in one of his letters, when he says,\r\n“that it does not refer to Furius Bibaculus, nor even to Sigida, nor to\r\nCato, the literator,” [857] meaning, doubtless, that Valerius Cato was\r\nboth a poet and an eminent grammarian.  Some there are who draw a\r\ndistinction between a literati and a literator, as the Greeks do between\r\na grammarian and a grammatist, applying the former term to men of real\r\nerudition, the latter to those whose pretensions to learning are\r\nmoderate; and this opinion Orbilius supports by examples.  For he says\r\nthat in old times, when a company of slaves was offered for sale by any\r\nperson, it was not customary, without good reason, to describe either of\r\nthem in the catalogue as a literati, but only as a literator, meaning\r\nthat he was not a proficient in letters, but had a smattering of\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nThe early grammarians taught rhetoric also, and we have many of their\r\ntreatises which include both sciences; whence it arose, I think, that in\r\nlater times, although the two professions had then become distinct, the\r\nold custom was retained, or the grammarians introduced into their\r\nteaching some of the elements required for public speaking, such as the\r\nproblem, the periphrasis, the choice of words, description of character,\r\nand the like; in order that they might not transfer (510) their pupils to\r\nthe rhetoricians no better than ill-taught boys.  But I perceive that\r\nthese lessons are now given up in some cases, on account of the want of\r\napplication, or the tender years, of the scholar, for I do not believe\r\nthat it arises from any dislike in the master.  I recollect that when I\r\nwas a boy it was the custom of one of these, whose name was Princeps, to\r\ntake alternate days for declaiming and disputing; and sometimes he would\r\nlecture in the morning, and declaim in the afternoon, when he had his\r\npulpit removed.  I heard, also, that even within the memories of our own\r\nfathers, some of the pupils of the grammarians passed directly from the\r\nschools to the courts, and at once took a high place in the ranks of the\r\nmost distinguished advocates.  The professors at that time were, indeed,\r\nmen of great eminence, of some of whom I may be able to give an account\r\nin the following chapters.\r\n\r\nV.  SAEVIUS [858] NICANOR first acquired fame and reputation by his\r\nteaching: and, besides, he made commentaries, the greater part of which,\r\nhowever, are said to have been borrowed.  He also wrote a satire, in\r\nwhich he informs us that he was a freedman, and had a double cognomen, in\r\nthe following verses;\r\n\r\n    Saevius Nicanor Marci libertus negabit,\r\n    Saevius Posthumius idem, sed Marcus, docebit.\r\n\r\n    What Saevius Nicanor, the freedman of Marcus, will deny,\r\n    The same Saevius, called also Posthumius Marcus, will assert.\r\n\r\nIt is reported, that in consequence of some infamy attached to his\r\ncharacter, he retired to Sardinia, and there ended his days.\r\n\r\nVI.  AURELIUS OPILIUS [859], the freedman of some Epicurean, first taught\r\nphilosophy, then rhetoric, and last of all, grammar.  (511) Having closed\r\nhis school, he followed Rutilius Rufus, when he was banished to Asia, and\r\nthere the two friends grew old together.  He also wrote several volumes\r\non a variety of learned topics, nine books of which he distinguished by\r\nthe number and names of the nine Muses; as he says, not without reason,\r\nthey being the patrons of authors and poets.  I observe that its title is\r\ngiven in several indexes by a single letter, but he uses two in the\r\nheading of a book called Pinax.\r\n\r\nVII.  MARCUS ANTONIUS GNIPHO [860], a free-born native of Gaul, was\r\nexposed in his infancy, and afterwards received his freedom from his\r\nfoster-father; and, as some say, was educated at Alexandria, where\r\nDionysius Scytobrachion [861] was his fellow pupil.  This, however, I am\r\nnot very ready to believe, as the times at which they flourished scarcely\r\nagree.  He is said to have been a man of great genius, of singular\r\nmemory, well read in Greek as well as Latin, and of a most obliging and\r\nagreeable temper, who never haggled about remuneration, but generally\r\nleft it to the liberality of his scholars.  He first taught in the house\r\nof Julius Caesar [862], when the latter was yet but a boy, and,\r\nafterwards, in his own private house.  He gave instruction in rhetoric\r\nalso, teaching the rules of eloquence every day, but declaiming only on\r\nfestivals.  It is said that some very celebrated men frequented his\r\nschool,--and, among others, Marcus Cicero, during the time he held the\r\npraetorship [863].  He wrote a number of works, although he did not live\r\nbeyond his fiftieth year; but Atteius, the philologist [864], says, that\r\nhe left only two volumes, “De Latino Sermone;” and, that the other works\r\nascribed to him, were composed by his disciples, and were not his,\r\nalthough his name is sometimes to be found in them.\r\n\r\nVIII.  M. POMPILIUS ANDRONICUS, a native of Syria, while he professed to\r\nbe a grammarian, was considered an idle follower of the Epicurean sect,\r\nand little qualified to be a master (512) of a school.  Finding,\r\ntherefore, that, at Rome, not only Antonius Gnipho, but even other\r\nteachers of less note were preferred to him, he retired to Cumae, where\r\nhe lived at his ease; and, though he wrote several books, he was so\r\nneedy, and reduced to such straits, as to be compelled to sell that\r\nexcellent little work of his, “The Index to the Annals,” for sixteen\r\nthousand sesterces.  Orbilius has informed us, that he redeemed this work\r\nfrom the oblivion into which it had fallen, and took care to have it\r\npublished with the author’s name.\r\n\r\nIX.  ORBILIUS PUPILLUS, of Beneventum, being left an orphan, by the death\r\nof his parents, who both fell a sacrifice to the plots of their enemies\r\non the same day, acted, at first, as apparitor to the magistrates.  He\r\nthen joined the troops in Macedonia, when he was first decorated with the\r\nplumed helmet [865], and, afterwards, promoted to serve on horseback.\r\nHaving completed his military service, he resumed his studies, which he\r\nhad pursued with no small diligence from his youth upwards; and, having\r\nbeen a professor for a long period in his own country, at last, during\r\nthe consulship of Cicero, made his way to Rome, where he taught with more\r\nreputation than profit.  For in one of his works he says, that “he was\r\nthen very old, and lived in a garret.”  He also published a book with the\r\ntitle of Perialogos; containing complaints of the injurious treatment to\r\nwhich professors submitted, without seeking redress at the hands of\r\nparents.  His sour temper betrayed itself, not only in his disputes with\r\nthe sophists opposed to him, whom he lashed on every occasion, but also\r\ntowards his scholars, as Horace tells us, who calls him “a flogger;”\r\n [866] and Domitius Marsus [867], who says of him:\r\n\r\n    Si quos Orbilius ferula scuticaque cecidit.\r\n    If those Orbilius with rod or ferule thrashed.\r\n\r\n(513) And not even men of rank escaped his sarcasms; for, before he\r\nbecame noticed, happening to be examined as a witness in a crowded court,\r\nVarro, the advocate on the other side, put the question to him, “What he\r\ndid and by what profession he gained his livelihood?”  He replied, “That\r\nhe lived by removing hunchbacks from the sunshine into the shade,”\r\n alluding to Muraena’s deformity.  He lived till he was near a hundred\r\nyears old; but he had long lost his memory, as the verse of Bibaculus\r\ninforms us:\r\n\r\n    Orbilius ubinam est, literarum oblivio?\r\n    Where is Orbilius now, that wreck of learning lost?\r\n\r\nHis statue is shown in the Capitol at Beneventum.  It stands on the left\r\nhand, and is sculptured in marble [868], representing him in a sitting\r\nposture, wearing the pallium, with two writing-cases in his hand.  He\r\nleft a son, named also Orbilius, who, like his father, was a professor of\r\ngrammar.\r\n\r\nX.  ATTEIUS, THE PHILOLOGIST, a freedman, was born at Athens.  Of him,\r\nCapito Atteius [869], the well-known jurisconsult, says that he was a\r\nrhetorician among the grammarians, and a grammarian among the\r\nrhetoricians.  Asinius Pollio [870], in the book in which he finds fault\r\nwith the writings of Sallust for his great affectation of obsolete words,\r\nspeaks thus: “In this work his chief assistant was a certain Atteius, a\r\nman of rank, a splendid Latin grammarian, the aider and preceptor of\r\nthose who studied the practice of declamation; in short, one who claimed\r\nfor himself the cognomen of Philologus.”  Writing to Lucius Hermas, he\r\nsays, “that he had made great proficiency in Greek literature, and some\r\nin Latin; that he had been a hearer of Antonius Gnipho, and his Hermas\r\n[871], and afterwards began to teach others.  Moreover, that he had for\r\npupils many illustrious youths, among whom were the two (514) brothers,\r\nAppius and Pulcher Claudius; and that he even accompanied them to their\r\nprovince.”  He appears to have assumed the name of Philologus, because,\r\nlike Eratosthenes [872], who first adopted that cognomen, he was in high\r\nrepute for his rich and varied stores of learning; which, indeed, is\r\nevident from his commentaries, though but few of them are extant.\r\nAnother letter, however, to the same Hermas, shews that they were very\r\nnumerous: “Remember,” it says, “to recommend generally our Extracts,\r\nwhich we have collected, as you know, of all kinds, into eight hundred\r\nbooks.”  He afterwards formed an intimate acquaintance with Caius\r\nSallustius, and, on his death, with Asinius Pollio; and when they\r\nundertook to write a history, he supplied the one with short annals of\r\nall Roman affairs, from which he could select at pleasure; and the other,\r\nwith rules on the art of composition.  I am, therefore, surprised that\r\nAsinius Pollio should have supposed that he was in the habit of\r\ncollecting old words and figures of speech for Sallust, when he must have\r\nknown that his own advice was, that none but well known, and common and\r\nappropriate expressions should be made use of; and that, above all\r\nthings, the obscurity of the style of Sallust, and his bold freedom in\r\ntranslations, should be avoided.\r\n\r\nXI.  VALERIUS CATO was, as some have informed us, the freedman of one\r\nBursenus, a native of Gaul.  He himself tells us, in his little work\r\ncalled “Indignatio,” that he was born free, and being left an orphan, was\r\nexposed to be easily stripped of his patrimony during the licence of\r\nSylla’s administrations.  He had a great number of distinguished pupils,\r\nand was highly esteemed as a preceptor suited to those who had a poetical\r\nturn, as appears from these short lines:\r\n\r\n    Cato grammaticus, Latina Siren,\r\n    Qui solus legit ac facit poetas.\r\n\r\n    Cato, the Latin Siren, grammar taught and verse,\r\n    To form the poet skilled, and poetry rehearse.\r\n\r\nBesides his Treatise on Grammar, he composed some poems, (515) of which,\r\nhis Lydia and Diana are most admired.  Ticida mentions his “Lydia.”\r\n\r\n    Lydia, doctorum maxima cura liber.\r\n    “Lydia,” a work to men of learning dear.\r\n\r\nCinna [873] thus notices the “Diana.”\r\n\r\n    Secula permaneat nostri Diana Catonis.\r\n    Immortal be our Cato’s song of Dian.\r\n\r\nHe lived to extreme old age, but in the lowest state of penury, and\r\nalmost in actual want; having retired to a small cottage when he gave up\r\nhis Tusculan villa to his creditors; as Bibaculus tells us:\r\n\r\n    Si quis forte mei domum Catonis,\r\n    Depictas minio assulas, et illos\r\n    Custodis vidit hortulos Priapi,\r\n    Miratur, quibus ille disciplinis,\r\n    Tantam sit sapientiam assecutus,\r\n    Quam tres cauliculi et selibra farris;\r\n    Racemi duo, tegula sub una,\r\n    Ad summam prope nutriant senectam.\r\n\r\n“If, perchance, any one has seen the house of my Cato, with marble slabs\r\nof the richest hues, and his gardens worthy of having Priapus [874] for\r\ntheir guardian, he may well wonder by what philosophy he has gained so\r\nmuch wisdom, that a daily allowance of three coleworts, half-a-pound of\r\nmeal, and two bunches of grapes, under a narrow roof, should serve for\r\nhis subsistence to extreme old age.”\r\n\r\nAnd he says in another place:\r\n\r\n    Catonis modo, Galle, Tusculanum\r\n    Tota creditor urbe venditahat.\r\n    Mirati sumus unicum magistrum,\r\n    Summum grammaticum, optimum poetam,\r\n    Omnes solvere posse quaestiones,\r\n    Unum difficile expedire nomen.\r\n    En cor Zenodoti, en jecur Cratetis!\r\n\r\n“We lately saw, my Gallus, Cato’s Tusculan villa exposed to public sale\r\nby his creditors; and wondered that such an unrivalled master of (516)\r\nthe schools, most eminent grammarian, and accomplished poet, could solve\r\nall propositions and yet found one question too difficult for him to\r\nsettle,--how to pay his debts.  We find in him the genius of Zenodotus\r\n[875], the wisdom of Crates.” [876]\r\n\r\nXII.  CORNELIUS EPICADIUS, a freedman of Lucius Cornelius Sylla, the\r\ndictator, was his apparitor in the Augural priesthood, and much beloved\r\nby his son Faustus; so that he was proud to call himself the freedman of\r\nboth.  He completed the last book of Sylla’s Commentaries, which his\r\npatron had left unfinished. [877]\r\n\r\nXIII.  LABERIUS HIERA was bought by his master out of a slave-dealer’s\r\ncage, and obtained his freedom on account of his devotion to learning.\r\nIt is reported that his disinterestedness was such, that he gave\r\ngratuitous instruction to the children of those who were proscribed in\r\nthe time of Sylla.\r\n\r\nXIV.  CURTIUS NICIA was the intimate friend of Cneius Pompeius and Caius\r\nMemmius; but having carried notes from Memmius to Pompey’s wife [878],\r\nwhen she was debauched by Memmius, Pompey was indignant, and forbad him\r\nhis house.  He was also on familiar terms with Marcus Cicero, who thus\r\nspeaks of him in his epistle to Dolabella [879]: “I have more need of\r\nreceiving letters from you, than you have of desiring them from me.  For\r\nthere is nothing going on at Rome in which I think you would take any\r\ninterest, except, perhaps, that you may like to know that I am appointed\r\numpire between our friends Nicias and Vidius.  The one, it appears,\r\nalleges in two short verses that Nicias owes him (517) money; the other,\r\nlike an Aristarchus, cavils at them.  I, like an old critic, am to decide\r\nwhether they are Nicias’s or spurious.”\r\n\r\nAgain, in a letter to Atticus [880], he says: “As to what you write about\r\nNicias, nothing could give me greater pleasure than to have him with me,\r\nif I was in a position to enjoy his society; but my province is to me a\r\nplace of retirement and solitude.  Sicca easily reconciled himself to\r\nthis state of things, and, therefore, I would prefer having him.\r\nBesides, you are well aware of the feebleness, and the nice and luxurious\r\nhabits, of our friend Nicias.  Why should I be the means of making him\r\nuncomfortable, when he can afford me no pleasure?  At the same time, I\r\nvalue his goodwill.”\r\n\r\nXV.  LENAEUS was a freedman of Pompey the Great, and attended him in most\r\nof his expeditions.  On the death of his patron and his sons, he\r\nsupported himself by teaching in a school which he opened near the temple\r\nof Tellus, in the Carium, in the quarter of the city where the house of\r\nthe Pompeys stood [881].  Such was his regard for his patron’s memory,\r\nthat when Sallust described him as having a brazen face, and a shameless\r\nmind, he lashed the historian in a most bitter satire [882], as “a\r\nbull’s-pizzle, a gormandizer, a braggart, and a tippler, a man whose life\r\nand writings were equally monstrous;” besides charging him with being “a\r\nmost unskilful plagiarist, who borrowed the language of Cato and other\r\nold writers.”  It is related, that, in his youth, having escaped from\r\nslavery by the contrivance of some of his friends, he took refuge in his\r\nown country; and, that after he had applied himself to the liberal arts,\r\nhe brought the price of his freedom to his former master, who, however,\r\nstruck by his talents and learning, gave him manumission gratuitously.\r\n\r\nXVI.  QUINTUS CAECILIUS, an Epirot by descent, but born at Tusculum, was\r\na freedman of Atticus Satrius, a Roman (518) knight, to whom Cicero\r\naddressed his Epistles [883].  He became the tutor of his patron’s\r\ndaughter [884], who was contracted to Marcus Agrippa, but being suspected\r\nof an illicit intercourse with her, and sent away on that account, he\r\nbetook himself to Cornelius Gallus, and lived with him on terms of the\r\ngreatest intimacy, which, indeed, was imputed to Gallus as one of his\r\nheaviest offences, by Augustus.  Then, after the condemnation and death\r\nof Gallus [885], he opened a school, but had few pupils, and those very\r\nyoung, nor any belonging to the higher orders, excepting the children of\r\nthose he could not refuse to admit.  He was the first, it is said, who\r\nheld disputations in Latin, and who began to lecture on Virgil and the\r\nother modern poets; which the verse of Domitius Marcus [886] points out.\r\n\r\n    Epirota tenellorum nutricula vatum.\r\n\r\n                 The Epirot who,\r\n    With tender care, our unfledged poets nursed.\r\n\r\nXVII.  VERRIUS FLACCUS [887], a freedman, distinguished himself by a new\r\nmode of teaching; for it was his practice to exercise the wits of his\r\nscholars, by encouraging emulation among them; not only proposing the\r\nsubjects on which they were to write, but offering rewards for those who\r\nwere successful in the contest.  These consisted of some ancient,\r\nhandsome, or rare book.  Being, in consequence, selected by Augustus, as\r\npreceptor to his grandsons, he transferred his entire school to the\r\nPalatium, but with the understanding that he should admit no fresh\r\nscholars.  The hall in Catiline’s house, (519) which had then been added\r\nto the palace, was assigned him for his school, with a yearly allowance\r\nof one hundred thousand sesterces.  He died of old age, in the reign of\r\nTiberius.  There is a statue of him at Praeneste, in the semi-circle at\r\nthe lower side of the forum, where he had set up calendars arranged by\r\nhimself, and inscribed on slabs of marble.\r\n\r\nXVIII.  LUCIUS CRASSITIUS, a native of Tarentum, and in rank a freedman,\r\nhad the cognomen of Pasides, which he afterwards changed for Pansa.  His\r\nfirst employment was connected with the stage, and his business was to\r\nassist the writers of farces.  After that, he took to giving lessons in a\r\ngallery attached to a house, until his commentary on “The Smyrna” [888]\r\nso brought him into notice, that the following lines were written on him:\r\n\r\n    Uni Crassitio se credere Smyrna probavit.\r\n      Desinite indocti, conjugio hanc petere.\r\n    Soli Crassitio se dixit nubere velle:\r\n      Intima cui soli nota sua exstiterint.\r\n\r\n    Crassitius only counts on Smyrna’s love,\r\n    Fruitless the wooings of the unlettered prove;\r\n    Crassitius she receives with loving arms,\r\n    For he alone unveiled her hidden charms.\r\n\r\nHowever, after having taught many scholars, some of whom were of high\r\nrank, and amongst others, Julius Antonius, the triumvir’s son, so that he\r\nmight be even compared with Verrius Flaccus; he suddenly closed his\r\nschool, and joined the sect of Quintus Septimius, the philosopher.\r\n\r\nXIX.  SCRIBONIUS APHRODISIUS, the slave and disciple of Orbilius, who was\r\nafterwards redeemed and presented with his freedom by Scribonia [889],\r\nthe daughter of Libo who had been the wife of Augustus, taught in the\r\ntime of Verrius; whose books on Orthography he also revised, not without\r\nsome severe remarks on his pursuits and conduct.\r\n\r\nXX.  C. JULIUS HYGINUS, a freedman of Augustus, was a native of Spain,\r\n(although some say he was born at Alexandria,) (520) and that when that\r\ncity was taken, Caesar brought him, then a boy, to Rome.  He closely and\r\ncarefully imitated Cornelius Alexander [890], a Greek grammarian, who,\r\nfor his antiquarian knowledge, was called by many Polyhistor, and by some\r\nHistory.  He had the charge of the Palatine library, but that did not\r\nprevent him from having many scholars; and he was one of the most\r\nintimate friends of the poet Ovid, and of Caius Licinius, the historian,\r\na man of consular rank [891], who has related that Hyginus died very\r\npoor, and was supported by his liberality as long as he lived.  Julius\r\nModestus [892], who was a freedman of Hyginus, followed the footsteps of\r\nhis patron in his studies and learning.\r\n\r\nXXI.  CAIUS MELISSUS [893], a native of Spoletum, was free-born, but\r\nhaving been exposed by his parents in consequence of quarrels between\r\nthem, he received a good education from his foster-father, by whose care\r\nand industry he was brought up, and was made a present of to Mecaenas, as\r\na grammarian.  Finding himself valued and treated as a friend, he\r\npreferred to continue in his state of servitude, although he was claimed\r\nby his mother, choosing rather his present condition than that which his\r\nreal origin entitled him to.  In consequence, his freedom was speedily\r\ngiven him, and he even became a favourite with Augustus.  By his\r\nappointment he was made curator of the library in the portico of Octavia\r\n[894];  and, as he himself informs us, undertook to compose, when he was\r\na sexagenarian, his books of “Witticisms,” which are now called “The Book\r\nof Jests.”  Of these he accomplished one hundred and fifty, to which he\r\nafterwards added several more.  He (521) also composed a new kind of\r\nstory about those who wore the toga, and called it “Trabeat.” [895]\r\n\r\nXXII.  MARCUS POMPONIUS MARCELLUS, a very severe critic of the Latin\r\ntongue, who sometimes pleaded causes, in a certain address on the\r\nplaintiff’s behalf, persisted in charging his adversary with making a\r\nsolecism, until Cassius Severus appealed to the judges to grant an\r\nadjournment until his client should produce another grammarian, as he was\r\nnot prepared to enter into a controversy respecting a solecism, instead\r\nof defending his client’s rights.  On another occasion, when he had found\r\nfault with some expression in a speech made by Tiberius, Atteius Capito\r\n[896] affirmed, “that if it was not Latin, at least it would be so in\r\ntime to come;” “Capito is wrong,” cried Marcellus; “it is certainly in\r\nyour power, Caesar, to confer the freedom of the city on whom you please,\r\nbut you cannot make words for us.”  Asinius Gallus [897] tells us that he\r\nwas formerly a pugilist, in the following epigram.\r\n\r\n    Qui caput ad laevam deicit, glossemata nobis\r\n    Praecipit; os nullum, vel potius pugilis.\r\n\r\n    Who ducked his head, to shun another’s fist,\r\n    Though he expound old saws,--yet, well I wist,\r\n    With pummelled nose and face, he’s but a pugilist.\r\n\r\nXXIII.  REMMIUS PALAEMON [898], of Vicentia [899], the offspring of a\r\nbond-woman, acquired the rudiments of learning, first as the companion of\r\na weaver’s, and then of his master’s, son, at school.  Being afterwards\r\nmade free, he taught at Rome, where he stood highest in the rank of the\r\ngrammarians; but he was so infamous for every sort of vice, that Tiberius\r\nand his successor Claudius publicly denounced him as an improper person\r\nto have the education of boys and young men entrusted to him.  Still, his\r\npowers of narrative and agreeable style of speaking made him very\r\npopular; besides which, he had the gift of making extempore verses.  He\r\nalso wrote a great many in (522) various and uncommon metres.  His\r\ninsolence was such, that he called Marcus Varro “a hog;” and bragged that\r\n“letters were born and would perish with him;” and that “his name was not\r\nintroduced inadvertently in the Bucolics [900], as Virgil divined that a\r\nPalaemon would some day be the judge of all poets and poems.”  He also\r\nboasted, that having once fallen into the hands of robbers, they spared\r\nhim on account of the celebrity his name had acquired.\r\n\r\nHe was so luxurious, that he took the bath many times in a day; nor did\r\nhis means suffice for his extravagance, although his school brought him\r\nin forty thousand sesterces yearly, and he received not much less from\r\nhis private estate, which he managed with great care.  He also kept a\r\nbroker’s shop for the sale of old clothes; and it is well known that a\r\nvine [901], he planted himself, yielded three hundred and fifty bottles\r\nof wine.  But the greatest of all his vices was his unbridled\r\nlicentiousness in his commerce with women, which he carried to the utmost\r\npitch of foul indecency [902].  They tell a droll story of some one who\r\nmet him in a crowd, and upon his offering to kiss him, could not escape\r\nthe salute, “Master,” said he, “do you want to mouth every one you meet\r\nwith in a hurry?”\r\n\r\nXXIV.  MARCUS VALERIUS PROBUS, of Berytus [903], after long aspiring to\r\nthe rank of centurion, being at last tired of waiting, devoted himself to\r\nstudy.  He had met with some old authors at a bookseller’s shop in the\r\nprovinces, where the memory of ancient times still lingers, and is not\r\nquite forgotten, as it is at Rome.  Being anxious carefully to reperuse\r\nthese, and afterwards to make acquaintance with other works of the same\r\nkind, he found himself an object of contempt, and was laughed (523) at\r\nfor his lectures, instead of their gaining him fame or profit.  Still,\r\nhowever, he persisted in his purpose, and employed himself in correcting,\r\nillustrating, and adding notes to many works which he had collected, his\r\nlabours being confined to the province of a grammarian, and nothing more.\r\nHe had, properly speaking, no scholars, but some few followers.  For he\r\nnever taught in such a way as to maintain the character of a master; but\r\nwas in the habit of admitting one or two, perhaps at most three or four,\r\ndisciples in the afternoon; and while he lay at ease and chatted freely\r\non ordinary topics, he occasionally read some book to them, but that did\r\nnot often happen.  He published a few slight treatises on some subtle\r\nquestions, besides which, he left a large collection of observations on\r\nthe language of the ancients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVES OF EMINENT RHETORICIANS.\r\n\r\n(524)\r\n\r\nI.  Rhetoric, also, as well as Grammar, was not introduced amongst us\r\ntill a late period, and with still more difficulty, inasmuch as we find\r\nthat, at times, the practice of it was even prohibited.  In order to\r\nleave no doubt of this, I will subjoin an ancient decree of the senate,\r\nas well as an edict of the censors:--“In the consulship of Caius Fannius\r\nStrabo, and Marcus Palerius Messala [904]: the praetor Marcus Pomponius\r\nmoved the senate, that an act be passed respecting Philosophers and\r\nRhetoricians.  In this matter, they have decreed as follows: ‘It shall be\r\nlawful for M. Pomponius, the praetor, to take such measures, and make\r\nsuch provisions, as the good of the Republic, and the duty of his office,\r\nrequire, that no Philosophers or Rhetoricians be suffered at Rome.’”\r\n\r\nAfter some interval, the censor Cnaeus Domitius Aenobarbus and Lucius\r\nLicinius Crassus issued the following edict upon the same subject: “It is\r\nreported to us that certain persons have instituted a new kind of\r\ndiscipline; that our youth resort to their schools; that they have\r\nassumed the title of Latin Rhetoricians; and that young men waste their\r\ntime there for whole days together.  Our ancestors have ordained what\r\ninstruction it is fitting their children should receive, and what schools\r\nthey should attend.  These novelties, contrary to the customs and\r\ninstructions of our ancestors, we neither approve, nor do they appear to\r\nus good.  Wherefore it appears to be our duty that we should notify our\r\njudgment both to those who keep such schools, and those who are in the\r\npractice of frequenting them, that they meet our disapprobation.”\r\n\r\nHowever, by slow degrees, rhetoric manifested itself to be a (525) useful\r\nand honourable study, and many persons devoted themselves to it, both as\r\na means of defence and of acquiring reputation.  Cicero declaimed in\r\nGreek until his praetorship, but afterwards, as he grew older, in Latin\r\nalso; and even in the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa [905], whom he\r\ncalls “his great and noble disciples.”  Some historians state that Cneius\r\nPompey resumed the practice of declaiming even during the civil war, in\r\norder to be better prepared to argue against Caius Curio, a young man of\r\ngreat talents, to whom the defence of Caesar was entrusted.  They say,\r\nlikewise, that it was not forgotten by Mark Antony, nor by Augustus, even\r\nduring the war of Modena.  Nero also declaimed [906] even after he became\r\nemperor, in the first year of his reign, which he had done before in\r\npublic but twice.  Many speeches of orators were also published.  In\r\nconsequence, public favour was so much attracted to the study of\r\nrhetoric, that a vast number of professors and learned men devoted\r\nthemselves to it; and it flourished to such a degree, that some of them\r\nraised themselves by it to the rank of senators and the highest offices.\r\n\r\nBut the same mode of teaching was not adopted by all, nor, indeed, did\r\nindividuals always confine themselves to the same system, but each varied\r\nhis plan of teaching according to circumstances.  For they were\r\naccustomed, in stating their argument with the utmost clearness, to use\r\nfigures and apologies, to put cases, as circumstances required, and to\r\nrelate facts, sometimes briefly and succinctly, and, at other times, more\r\nat large and with greater feeling.  Nor did they omit, on occasion, to\r\nresort to translations from the Greek, and to expatiate in the praise, or\r\nto launch their censures on the faults, of illustrious men.  They also\r\ndealt with matters connected with every-day life, pointing out such as\r\nare useful and necessary, and such as are hurtful and needless.  They had\r\noccasion often to support the authority of fabulous accounts, and to\r\ndetract from that of historical narratives, which sort the Greeks call\r\n“Propositions,” “Refutations” and “Corroboration,” until by a gradual\r\nprocess they have exhausted these topics, and arrive at the gist of the\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients, subjects of controversy were drawn either from\r\nhistory, as indeed some are even now, or from (526) actual facts, of\r\nrecent occurrence.  It was, therefore, the custom to state them\r\nprecisely, with details of the names of places.  We certainly so find\r\nthem collected and published, and it may be well to give one or two of\r\nthem literally, by way of example:\r\n\r\n“A company of young men from the city, having made an excursion to Ostia\r\nin the summer season, and going down to the beach, fell in with some\r\nfishermen who were casting their nets in the sea.  Having bargained with\r\nthem for the haul, whatever it might turn out to be, for a certain sum,\r\nthey paid down the money.  They waited a long time while the nets were\r\nbeing drawn, and when at last they were dragged on shore, there was no\r\nfish in them, but some gold sewn up in a basket.  The buyers claim the\r\nhaul as theirs, the fishermen assert that it belongs to them.”\r\n\r\nAgain: “Some dealers having to land from a ship at Brundusium a cargo of\r\nslaves, among which there was a handsome boy of great value, they, in\r\norder to deceive the collectors of the customs, smuggled him ashore in\r\nthe dress of a freeborn youth, with the bullum [907] hung about his neck.\r\nThe fraud easily escaped detection.  They proceed to Rome; the affair\r\nbecomes the subject of judicial inquiry; it is alleged that the boy was\r\nentitled to his freedom, because his master had voluntarily treated him\r\nas free.”\r\n\r\nFormerly, they called these by a Greek term, syntaxeis, but of late\r\n“controversies;” but they may be either fictitious cases, or those which\r\ncome under trial in the courts.  Of the eminent professors of this\r\nscience, of whom any memorials are extant, it would not be easy to find\r\nmany others than those of whom I shall now proceed to give an account.\r\n\r\nII.  LUCIUS PLOTIUS GALLUS.  Of him Marcus Tullius Cicero thus writes to\r\nMarcus Titinnius [908]: “I remember well that when we were boys, one\r\nLucius Plotius first began to teach Latin; and as great numbers flocked\r\nto his school, so that all who were most devoted to study were eager to\r\ntake lessons from him, it was a great trouble to me that I too was not\r\nallowed to do so.  I was prevented, however, by the decided opinion (527)\r\nof men of the greatest learning, who considered that it was best to\r\ncultivate the genius by the study of Greek.”  This same Gallus, for he\r\nlived to a great age, was pointed at by M. Caelius, in a speech which he\r\nwas forced to make in his own cause, as having supplied his accuser,\r\nAtracinus [909], with materials for his charge.  Suppressing his name, he\r\nsays that such a rhetorician was like barley bread [910] compared to a\r\nwheaten loaf,--windy, chaffy, and coarse.\r\n\r\nIII.  LUCIUS OCTACILIUS PILITUS is said to have been a slave, and,\r\naccording to the old custom, chained to the door like a watch-dog [911];\r\nuntil, having been presented with his freedom for his genius and devotion\r\nto learning, he drew up for his patron the act of accusation in a cause\r\nhe was prosecuting.  After that, becoming a professor of rhetoric, he\r\ngave instructions to Cneius Pompey the Great, and composed an account of\r\nhis actions, as well as of those of his father, being the first freedman,\r\naccording to the opinion of Cornelius Nepos [912], who ventured to write\r\nhistory, which before his time had not been done by any one who was not\r\nof the highest ranks in society.\r\n\r\nIV.  About this time, EPIDIUS [913] having fallen into disgrace for\r\nbringing a false accusation, opened a school of instruction, in which he\r\ntaught, among others, Mark Antony and Augustus.  On one occasion Caius\r\nCanutius jeered them for presuming to belong to the party of the consul\r\nIsauricus [914] in his administration of the republic; upon which he\r\nreplied, that he would rather be the disciple of Isauricus, than of\r\nEpidius, the false accuser.  This Epidius claimed to be descended from\r\nEpidius Nuncio, who, as (528) ancient traditions assert, fell into the\r\nfountain of the river Sarnus [915] when the streams were overflown, and\r\nnot being afterwards found, was reckoned among the number of the gods.\r\n\r\nV. SEXTUS CLODIUS, a native of Sicily, a professor both of Greek and\r\nLatin eloquence, had bad eyes and a facetious tongue.  It was a saying of\r\nhis, that he lost a pair of eyes from his intimacy with Mark Antony, the\r\ntriumvir [916].  Of his wife, Fulvia, when there was a swelling in one of\r\nher cheeks, he said that “she tempted the point of his style;” [917] nor\r\ndid Antony think any the worse of him for the joke, but quite enjoyed it;\r\nand soon afterwards, when Antony was consul [918], he even made him a\r\nlarge grant of land, which Cicero charges him with in his Philippics\r\n[919].  “You patronize,” he said, “a master of the schools for the sake\r\nof his buffoonery, and make a rhetorician one of your pot-companions;\r\nallowing him to cut his jokes on any one he pleased; a witty man, no\r\ndoubt, but it was an easy matter to say smart things of such as you and\r\nyour companions.  But listen, Conscript Fathers, while I tell you what\r\nreward was given to this rhetorician, and let the wounds of the republic\r\nbe laid bare to view.  You assigned two thousand acres of the Leontine\r\nterritory [920] to Sextus Clodius, the rhetorician, and not content with\r\nthat, exonerated the estate from all taxes.  Hear this, and learn from\r\nthe extravagance of the grant, how little wisdom is displayed in your\r\nacts.”\r\n\r\nVI.  CAIUS ALBUTIUS SILUS, of Novara [921], while, in the execution (529)\r\nof the office of edile in his native place, he was sitting for the\r\nadministration of justice, was dragged by the feet from the tribunal by\r\nsome persons against whom he was pronouncing a decree.  In great\r\nindignation at this usage, he made straight for the gate of the town, and\r\nproceeded to Rome.  There he was admitted to fellowship, and lodged, with\r\nPlancus the orator [922], whose practice it was, before he made a speech\r\nin public, to set up some one to take the contrary side in the argument.\r\nThe office was undertaken by Albutius with such success, that he silenced\r\nPlancus, who did not venture to put himself in competition with him.\r\nThis bringing him into notice, he collected an audience of his own, and\r\nit was his custom to open the question proposed for debate, sitting; but\r\nas he warmed with the subject, he stood up, and made his peroration in\r\nthat posture.  His declamations were of different kinds; sometimes\r\nbrilliant and polished, at others, that they might not be thought to\r\nsavour too much of the schools, he curtailed them of all ornament, and\r\nused only familiar phrases.  He also pleaded causes, but rarely, being\r\nemployed in such as were of the highest importance, and in every case\r\nundertaking the peroration only.\r\n\r\nIn the end, he gave up practising in the forum, partly from shame, partly\r\nfrom fear.  For, in a certain trial before the court of the One Hundred\r\n[923], having lashed the defendant as a man void of natural affection for\r\nhis parents, he called upon him by a bold figure of speech, “to swear by\r\nthe ashes of his father and mother which lay unburied;” his adversary\r\ntaking him up for the suggestion, and the judges frowning upon it, he\r\nlost his cause, and was much blamed.  At another time, on a trial for\r\nmurder at Milan, before Lucius Piso, the proconsul, having to defend the\r\nculprit, he worked himself up to such a pitch of vehemence, that in a\r\ncrowded court, who loudly applauded him, notwithstanding all the efforts\r\nof the lictor to maintain order, he broke out into a lamentation on the\r\nmiserable state of Italy [924], then in danger of being again reduced, he\r\nsaid, into (530) the form of a province, and turning to the statue of\r\nMarcus Brutus, which stood in the Forum, he invoked him as “the founder\r\nand vindicator of the liberties of the people.”  For this he narrowly\r\nescaped a prosecution.  Suffering, at an advanced period of life, from an\r\nulcerated tumour, he returned to Novara, and calling the people together\r\nin a public assembly, addressed them in a set speech, of considerable\r\nlength, explaining the reasons which induced him to put an end to\r\nexistence: and this he did by abstaining from food.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE LIVES OF GRAMMARIANS AND RHETORICIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVES OF THE POETS.\r\n\r\n(531)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF TERENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublius Terentius Afer, a native of Carthage, was a slave, at Rome, of\r\nthe senator Terentius Lucanus, who, struck by his abilities and handsome\r\nperson, gave him not only a liberal education in his youth, but his\r\nfreedom when he arrived at years of maturity.  Some say that he was a\r\ncaptive taken in war, but this, as Fenestella [925] informs us, could by\r\nno means have been the case, since both his birth and death took place in\r\nthe interval between the termination of the second Punic war and the\r\ncommencement of the third [926]; nor, even supposing that he had been\r\ntaken prisoner by the Numidian or Getulian tribes, could he have fallen\r\ninto the hands of a Roman general, as there was no commercial intercourse\r\nbetween the Italians and Africans until after the fall of Carthage [927].\r\nTerence lived in great familiarity with many persons of high station, and\r\nespecially with Scipio Africanus, and Caius Delius, whose favour he is\r\neven supposed to have purchased by the foulest means.  But Fenestella\r\nreverses the charge, contending that Terence was older than either of\r\nthem.  Cornelius Nepos, however, (532) informs us that they were all of\r\nnearly equal age; and Porcias intimates a suspicion of this criminal\r\ncommerce in the following passage:--\r\n\r\n“While Terence plays the wanton with the great, and recommends himself to\r\nthem by the meretricious ornaments of his person; while, with greedy\r\nears, he drinks in the divine melody of Africanus’s voice; while he\r\nthinks of being a constant guest at the table of Furius, and the handsome\r\nLaelius; while he thinks that he is fondly loved by them, and often\r\ninvited to Albanum for his youthful beauty, he finds himself stripped of\r\nhis property, and reduced to the lowest state of indigence.  Then,\r\nwithdrawing from the world, he betook himself to Greece, where he met his\r\nend, dying at Strymphalos, a town in Arcadia.  What availed him the\r\nfriendship of Scipio, of Laelius, or of Furius, three of the most\r\naffluent nobles of that age?  They did not even minister to his\r\nnecessities so much as to provide him a hired house, to which his slave\r\nmight return with the intelligence of his master’s death.”\r\n\r\nHe wrote comedies, the earliest of which, The Andria, having to be\r\nperformed at the public spectacles given by the aediles [928], he was\r\ncommanded to read it first before Caecilius [929].  Having been\r\nintroduced while Caecilius was at supper, and being meanly dressed, he is\r\nreported to have read the beginning of the play seated on a low stool\r\nnear the great man’s couch.  But after reciting a few verses, he was\r\ninvited to take his place at table, and, having supped with his host,\r\nwent through the rest to his great delight.  This play and five others\r\nwere received by the public with similar applause, although Volcatius, in\r\nhis enumeration of them, says that “The Hecyra [930] must not be reckoned\r\namong these.”\r\n\r\nThe Eunuch was even acted twice the same day [931], and earned more money\r\nthan any comedy, whoever was the writer, had (533) ever done before,\r\nnamely, eight thousand sesterces [932]; besides which, a certain sum\r\naccrued to the author for the title.  But Varro prefers the opening of\r\nThe Adelphi [933] to that of Menander.  It is very commonly reported that\r\nTerence was assisted in his works by Laelius and Scipio [934], with whom\r\nhe lived in such great intimacy.  He gave some currency to this report\r\nhimself, nor did he ever attempt to defend himself against it, except in\r\na light way; as in the prologue to The Adelphi:\r\n\r\n    Nam quod isti dicunt malevoli, homines nohiles\r\n    Hunc adjutare, assidueque una scribere;\r\n    Quod illi maledictun vehemens existimant,\r\n    Eam laudem hic ducit maximam: cum illis placet,\r\n    Qui vobis universis et populo placent;\r\n    Quorum opera in bello, in otio, in negotio,\r\n    Suo quisque tempore usus est sine superbia.\r\n\r\n                                --------For this,\r\n    Which malice tells that certain noble persons\r\n    Assist the bard, and write in concert with him,\r\n    That which they deem a heavy slander, he\r\n    Esteems his greatest praise: that he can please\r\n    Those who in war, in peace, as counsellors,\r\n    Have rendered you the dearest services,\r\n    And ever borne their faculties so meekly.\r\n                                          Colman.\r\n\r\nHe appears to have protested against this imputation with less\r\nearnestness, because the notion was far from being disagreeable to\r\nLaelius and Scipio.  It therefore gained ground, and prevailed in\r\nafter-times.\r\n\r\nQuintus Memmius, in his speech in his own defence, says “Publius\r\nAfricanus, who borrowed from Terence a character which he had acted in\r\nprivate, brought it on the stage in his name.”  Nepos tells us he found\r\nin some book that C. Laelius, when he was on some occasion at Puteoli, on\r\nthe calends [the first] of March, [935] being requested by his wife to\r\nrise early, (534) begged her not to suffer him to be disturbed, as he had\r\ngone to bed late, having been engaged in writing with more than usual\r\nsuccess.  On her asking him to tell her what he had been writing, he\r\nrepeated the verses which are found in the Heautontimoroumenos:\r\n\r\n    Satis pol proterve me Syri promessa--Heauton. IV. iv. 1.\r\n    I’faith! the rogue Syrus’s impudent pretences--\r\n\r\nSantra [936] is of opinion that if Terence required any assistance in his\r\ncompositions [937], he would not have had recourse to Scipio and Laelius,\r\nwho were then very young men, but rather to Sulpicius Gallus [938], an\r\naccomplished scholar, who had been the first to introduce his plays at\r\nthe games given by the consuls; or to Q. Fabius Labeo, or Marcus Popilius\r\n[939], both men of consular rank, as well as poets.  It was for this\r\nreason that, in alluding to the assistance he had received, he did not\r\nspeak of his coadjutors as very young men, but as persons of whose\r\nservices the people had full experience in peace, in war, and in the\r\nadministration of affairs.\r\n\r\nAfter he had given his comedies to the world, at a time when he had not\r\npassed his thirty-fifth year, in order to avoid suspicion, as he found\r\nothers publishing their works under his name, or else to make himself\r\nacquainted with the modes of life and habits of the Greeks, for the\r\npurpose of exhibiting them in his plays, he withdrew from home, to which\r\nhe never returned.  Volcatius gives this account of his death:\r\n\r\n    Sed ut Afer sei populo dedit comoedias,\r\n    Iter hic in Asiam fecit.  Navem cum semel\r\n    Conscendit, visus nunquam est.  Sic vita vacat.\r\n\r\n    (535) When Afer had produced six plays for the entertainment of the\r\n        people,\r\n    He embarked for Asia; but from the time he went on board ship\r\n    He was never seen again.  Thus he ended his life.\r\n\r\nQ. Consentius reports that he perished at sea on his voyage back from\r\nGreece, and that one hundred and eight plays, of which he had made a\r\nversion from Menander [940], were lost with him.  Others say that he died\r\nat Stymphalos, in Arcadia, or in Leucadia, during the consulship of Cn.\r\nCornelius Dolabella and Marcus Fulvius Nobilior [941], worn out with a\r\nsevere illness, and with grief and regret for the loss of his baggage,\r\nwhich he had sent forward in a ship that was wrecked, and contained the\r\nlast new plays he had written.\r\n\r\nIn person, Terence is reported to have been rather short and slender,\r\nwith a dark complexion.  He had an only daughter, who was afterwards\r\nmarried to a Roman knight; and he left also twenty acres of garden ground\r\n[942], on the Appian Way, at the Villa of Mars.  I, therefore, wonder the\r\nmore how Porcius could have written the verses,\r\n\r\n                          --------nihil Publius\r\n    Scipio profuit, nihil et Laelius, nihil Furius,\r\n    Tres per idem tempus qui agitabant nobiles facillime.\r\n    Eorum ille opera ne domum quidem habuit conductitiam\r\n    Saltem ut esset, quo referret obitum domini servulus. [943]\r\n\r\nAfranius places him at the head of all the comic writers, declaring, in\r\nhis Compitalia,\r\n\r\n    Terentio non similem dices quempiam.\r\n    Terence’s equal cannot soon be found.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Volcatius reckons him inferior not only (536) to\r\nNaevius, Plautus, and Caecilius, but also to Licinius.  Cicero pays him\r\nthis high compliment, in his Limo--\r\n\r\n    Tu quoque, qui solus lecto sermone, Terenti,\r\n    Conversum expressumque Latina voce Menandrum\r\n    In medio populi sedatis vocibus offers,\r\n    Quidquid come loquens, ac omnia dulcia dicens.\r\n\r\n“You, only, Terence, translated into Latin, and clothed in choice\r\nlanguage the plays of Menander, and brought them before the public, who,\r\nin crowded audiences, hung upon hushed applause--\r\n\r\n    Grace marked each line, and every period charmed.”\r\n\r\nSo also Caius Caesar:\r\n\r\n    Tu quoque tu in summis, O dimidiate Menander,\r\n    Poneris, et merito, puri sermonis amator,\r\n    Lenibus atque utinam scriptis adjuncta foret vis\r\n    Comica, ut aequato virtus polleret honore\r\n    Cum Graecis, neque in hoc despectus parte jaceres!\r\n    Unum hoc maceror, et doleo tibi deesse, Terenti.\r\n\r\n“You, too, who divide your honours with Menander, will take your place\r\namong poets of the highest order, and justly too, such is the purity of\r\nyour style.  Would only that to your graceful diction was added more\r\ncomic force, that your works might equal in merit the Greek masterpieces,\r\nand your inferiority in this particular should not expose you to censure.\r\nThis is my only regret; in this, Terence, I grieve to say you are\r\nwanting.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF JUVENAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nD. JUNIUS JUVENALIS, who was either the son [944] of a wealthy freedman,\r\nor brought up by him, it is not known which, declaimed till the middle of\r\nlife [945], more from the bent of his inclination, than from any desire\r\nto prepare himself either for the schools or the forum.  But having\r\ncomposed a short satire [946], which was clever enough, on Paris [947],\r\nthe actor of pantomimes, (537) and also on the poet of Claudius Nero, who\r\nwas puffed up by having held some inferior military rank for six months\r\nonly; he afterwards devoted himself with much zeal to that style of\r\nwriting.  For a while indeed, he had not the courage to read them even to\r\na small circle of auditors, but it was not long before he recited his\r\nsatires to crowded audiences, and with entire success; and this he did\r\ntwice or thrice, inserting new lines among those which he had originally\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\n    Quod non dant proceres, dabit histrio, tu Camerinos,\r\n    Et Bareas, tu nobilium magna atria curas.\r\n    Praefectos Pelopea facit, Philomela tribunos.\r\n\r\n    Behold an actor’s patronage affords\r\n    A surer means of rising than a lord’s!\r\n    And wilt thou still the Camerino’s [948] court,\r\n    Or to the halls of Bareas resort,\r\n    When tribunes Pelopea can create\r\n    And Philomela praefects, who shall rule the state? [949]\r\n\r\nAt that time the player was in high favour at court, and many of those\r\nwho fawned upon him were daily raised to posts of honour.  Juvenal\r\ntherefore incurred the suspicion of having covertly satirized occurrences\r\nwhich were then passing, and, although eighty years old at that time\r\n[950], he was immediately removed from the city, being sent into\r\nhonourable banishment as praefect of a cohort, which was under orders to\r\nproceed to a station at the extreme frontier of Egypt [951].  That (538)\r\nsort of punishment was selected, as it appeared severe enough for an\r\noffence which was venial, and a mere piece of drollery.  However, he died\r\nvery soon afterwards, worn down by grief, and weary of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF PERSIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAULUS PERSIUS FLACCUS was born the day before the Nones of December [4th\r\nDec.] [952], in the consulship of Fabius Persicus and L. Vitellius.  He\r\ndied on the eighth of the calends of December [24th Nov.] [953] in the\r\nconsulship of Rubrius Marius and Asinius Gallus.  Though born at\r\nVolterra, in Etruria, he was a Roman knight, allied both by blood and\r\nmarriage to persons of the highest rank [954].  He ended his days at an\r\nestate he had at the eighth milestone on the Appian Way.  His father,\r\nFlaccus, who died when he was barely six years old, left him under the\r\ncare of guardians, and his mother, Fulvia Silenna, who afterwards married\r\nFusius, a Roman knight, buried him also in a very few years.  Persius\r\nFlaccus pursued his studies at Volterra till he was twelve years old, and\r\nthen continued them at Rome, under Remmius Palaemon, the grammarian, and\r\nVerginius Flaccus, the rhetorician.  Arriving at the age of twenty-one,\r\nhe formed a friendship with Annaeus Cornutus [955], which lasted through\r\nlife; and from him he learned the rudiments of philosophy.  Among his\r\nearliest friends were Caesius Bassus [956], and Calpurnius Statura; the\r\nlatter of whom died while Persius himself was yet in his youth.\r\nServilius (539) Numanus [957], he reverenced as a father.  Through\r\nCornutus he was introduced to Annaeus, as well as to Lucan, who was of\r\nhis own age, and also a disciple of Cornutus.  At that time Cornutus was\r\na tragic writer; he belonged to the sect of the Stoics, and left behind\r\nhim some philosophical works.  Lucan was so delighted with the writings\r\nof Persius Flaccus, that he could scarcely refrain from giving loud\r\ntokens of applause while the author was reciting them, and declared that\r\nthey had the true spirit of poetry.  It was late before Persius made the\r\nacquaintance of Seneca, and then he was not much struck with his natural\r\nendowments.  At the house of Cornutus he enjoyed the society of two very\r\nlearned and excellent men, who were then zealously devoting themselves to\r\nphilosophical enquiries, namely, Claudius Agaternus, a physician from\r\nLacedaemon, and Petronius Aristocrates, of Magnesia, men whom he held in\r\nthe highest esteem, and with whom he vied in their studies, as they were\r\nof his own age, being younger than Cornutus.  During nearly the last ten\r\nyears of his life he was much beloved by Thraseas, so that he sometimes\r\ntravelled abroad in his company; and his cousin Arria was married to him.\r\n\r\nPersius was remarkable for gentle manners, for a modesty amounting to\r\nbashfulness, a handsome form, and an attachment to his mother, sister,\r\nand aunt, which was most exemplary.  He was frugal and chaste.  He left\r\nhis mother and sister twenty thousand sesterces, requesting his mother,\r\nin a written codicil, to present to Cornutus, as some say, one hundred\r\nsesterces, or as others, twenty pounds of wrought silver [958], besides\r\nabout seven hundred books, which, indeed, included his whole library.\r\nCornutus, however, would only take the books, and gave up the legacy to\r\nthe sisters, whom his brother had constituted his heirs.\r\n\r\nHe wrote [959] seldom, and not very fast; even the work we possess he\r\nleft incomplete.  Some verses are wanting at the end of the book [960],\r\nbut Cornutus thoughtlessly recited it, as if (540) it was finished; and\r\non Caesius Bassus requesting to be allowed to publish it, he delivered it\r\nto him for that purpose., In his younger days, Persius had written a\r\nplay, as well as an Itinerary, with several copies of verses on Thraseas’\r\nfather-in-law, and Arria’s [961] mother, who had made away with herself\r\nbefore her husband.  But Cornutus used his whole influence with the\r\nmother of Persius to prevail upon her to destroy these compositions.  As\r\nsoon as his book of Satires was published, all the world began to admire\r\nit, and were eager to buy it up.  He died of a disease in the stomach, in\r\nthe thirtieth year of his age [962].  But no sooner had he left school\r\nand his masters, than he set to work with great vehemence to compose\r\nsatires, from having read the tenth book of Lucilius; and made the\r\nbeginning of that book his model; presently launching his invectives all\r\naround with so little scruple, that he did not spare cotemporary poets\r\nand orators, and even lashed Nero himself, who was then the reigning\r\nprince.  The verse ran as follows:\r\n\r\n    Auriculas asini Mida rex habet;\r\n    King Midas has an ass’s ears;\r\n\r\nbut Cornutus altered it thus;\r\n\r\n    Auriculas asini quis non hahet?\r\n    Who has not an ass’s ears?\r\n\r\nin order that it might not be supposed that it was meant to apply to\r\nNero.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF HORACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORATIUS FLACCUS was a native of Venusium [963], his father having been,\r\nby his own account [964], a freedman and collector of taxes, but, as it\r\nis generally believed, a dealer in salted (541) provisions; for some one\r\nwith whom Horace had a quarrel, jeered him, by saying; “How often have I\r\nseen your father wiping his nose with his fist?”  In the battle of\r\nPhilippi, he served as a military tribune [965], which post he filled at\r\nthe instance of Marcus Brutus [966], the general; and having obtained a\r\npardon, on the overthrow of his party, he purchased the office of scribe\r\nto a quaestor.  Afterwards insinuating himself first, into the good\r\ngraces of Mecaenas, and then of Augustus, he secured no small share in\r\nthe regard of both.  And first, how much Mecaenas loved him may be seen\r\nby the epigram in which he says:\r\n\r\n    Ni te visceribus meis, Horati,\r\n    Plus jam diligo, Titium sodalem,\r\n    Ginno tu videas strigosiorem. [967]\r\n\r\nBut it was more strongly exhibited by Augustus, in a short sentence\r\nuttered in his last moments: “Be as mindful of Horatius Flaccus as you\r\nare of me!”  Augustus offered to appoint him his secretary, signifying\r\nhis wishes to Mecaenas in a letter to the following effect: “Hitherto I\r\nhave been able to write my own epistles to friends; but now I am too much\r\noccupied, and in an infirm state of health.  I wish, therefore, to\r\ndeprive you of our Horace: let him leave, therefore, your luxurious table\r\nand come to the palace, and he shall assist me in writing my letters.”\r\n And upon his refusing to accept the office, he neither exhibited the\r\nsmallest displeasure, nor ceased to heap upon him tokens of his regard.\r\nLetters of his are extant, from which I will make some short extracts to\r\nestablish this: “Use your influence over me with the same freedom as you\r\nwould do if we were living together as friends.  In so doing you will be\r\nperfectly right, and guilty of no impropriety; for I could wish that our\r\nintercourse should be on that footing, if your health admitted of it.”\r\n And again: “How I hold you in memory you may learn (542) from our friend\r\nSeptimius [968], for I happened to mention you when he was present.  And\r\nif you are so proud as to scorn my friendship, that is no reason why I\r\nshould lightly esteem yours, in return.”  Besides this, among other\r\ndrolleries, he often called him, “his most immaculate penis,” and “his\r\ncharming little man,” and loaded him from time to time with proofs of his\r\nmunificence.  He admired his works so much, and was so convinced of their\r\nenduring fame, that he directed him to compose the Secular Poem, as well\r\nas that on the victory of his stepsons Tiberius and Drusus over the\r\nVindelici [969]; and for this purpose urged him to add, after a long\r\ninterval, a fourth book of Odes to the former three.  After reading his\r\n“Sermones,” in which he found no mention of himself, he complained in\r\nthese terms: “You must know that I am very angry with you, because in\r\nmost of your works of this description you do not choose to address\r\nyourself to me.  Are you afraid that, in times to come, your reputation\r\nwill suffer; in case it should appear that you lived on terms of intimate\r\nfriendship with me?”  And he wrung from him the eulogy which begins with,\r\n\r\n    Cum tot sustineas, et tanta negotia solus:\r\n    Res Italas armis tuteris, moribus ornes,\r\n    Legibus emendes: in publica commoda peccem,\r\n    Si longo sermone morer tua tempora, Caesar.--Epist. ii. i.\r\n\r\n    While you alone sustain the important weight\r\n    Of Rome’s affairs, so various and so great;\r\n    While you the public weal with arms defend,\r\n    Adorn with morals, and with laws amend;\r\n    Shall not the tedious letter prove a crime,\r\n    That steals one moment of our Caesar’s time.--Francis.\r\n\r\nIn person, Horace was short and fat, as he is described by himself in his\r\nSatires [970], and by Augustus in the following letter: “Dionysius has\r\nbrought me your small volume, which, little as it is, not to blame you\r\nfor that, I shall judge favourably.  You seem to me, however, to be\r\nafraid lest your volumes should be bigger than yourself.  But if you are\r\nshort in stature, you are corpulent enough.  You may, therefore, (543) if\r\nyou will, write in a quart, when the size of your volume is as large\r\nround as your paunch.”\r\n\r\nIt is reported that he was immoderately addicted to venery.  [For he is\r\nsaid to have had obscene pictures so disposed in a bedchamber lined with\r\nmirrors, that, whichever way he looked, lascivious images might present\r\nthemselves to his view.] [971]  He lived for the most part in the\r\nretirement of his farm [972], on the confines of the Sabine and Tiburtine\r\nterritories, and his house is shewn in the neighbourhood of a little wood\r\nnot far from Tibur.  Some Elegies ascribed to him, and a prose Epistle\r\napparently written to commend himself to Mecaenas, have been handed down\r\nto us; but I believe that neither of them are genuine works of his; for\r\nthe Elegies are commonplace, and the Epistle is wanting in perspicuity, a\r\nfault which cannot be imputed to his style.  He was born on the sixth of\r\nthe ides of December [27th December], in the consulship of Lucius Cotta\r\n[973] and Lucius Torquatus; and died on the fifth of the calends of\r\nDecember [27th November], in the consulship of Caius Marcius Censorinus\r\nand Caius Asinius Gallus [974]; having completed his fifty-ninth year.\r\nHe made a nuncupatory will, declaring Augustus his heir, not being able,\r\nfrom the violence of his disorder, to sign one in due form.  He was\r\ninterred and lies buried on the skirts of the Esquiline Hill, near the\r\ntomb of Mecaenas. [975]\r\n\r\n(544) M. ANNAEUS LUCANUS, a native of Corduba [976], first tried the\r\npowers of his genius in an encomium on Nero, at the Quinquennial games.\r\nHe afterwards recited his poem on the Civil War carried on between Pompey\r\nand Caesar.  His vanity was so immense, and he gave such liberty to his\r\ntongue, that in some preface, comparing his age and his first efforts\r\nwith those of Virgil, he had the assurance to say: “And what now remains\r\nfor me is to deal with a gnat.”  In his early youth, after being long\r\ninformed of the sort of life his father led in the country, in\r\nconsequence of an unhappy marriage [977], he was recalled from Athens by\r\nNero, who admitted him into the circle of his friends, and even gave him\r\nthe honour of the quaestorship; but he did not long remain in favour.\r\nSmarting at this, and having publicly stated that Nero had withdrawn, all\r\nof a sudden, without communicating with the senate, and without any other\r\nmotive than his own recreation, after this he did not cease to assail the\r\nemperor both with foul words and with acts which are still notorious.  So\r\nthat on one occasion, when easing his bowels in the common privy, there\r\nbeing a louder explosion than usual, he gave vent to the nemistych of\r\nNero: “One would suppose it was thundering under ground,” in the hearing\r\nof those who were sitting there for the same purpose, and who took to\r\ntheir heels in much consternation [978].  In a poem also, which was in\r\nevery one’s hands, he severely lashed both the emperor and his most\r\npowerful adherents.\r\n\r\nAt length, he became nearly the most active leader in Piso’s conspiracy\r\n[979]; and while he dwelt without reserve in many quarters on the glory\r\nof those who dipped their hands in the (545) blood of tyrants, he\r\nlaunched out into open threats of violence, and carried them so far as to\r\nboast that he would cast the emperor’s head at the feet of his\r\nneighbours.  When, however, the plot was discovered, he did not exhibit\r\nany firmness of mind.  A confession was wrung from him without much\r\ndifficulty; and, humbling himself to the most abject entreaties, he even\r\nnamed his innocent mother as one of the conspirators [980]; hoping that\r\nhis want of natural affection would give him favour in the eyes of a\r\nparricidal prince.  Having obtained permission to choose his mode of\r\ndeath [981], he wrote notes to his father, containing corrections of some\r\nof his verses, and, having made a full meal, allowed a physician to open\r\nthe veins in his arm [982].  I have also heard it said that his poems\r\nwere offered for sale, and commented upon, not only with care and\r\ndiligence, but also in a trifling way. [983]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF PLINY.\r\n\r\n[984]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLINIUS SECUNDUS, a native of New Como [985], having served in (546)\r\nthe wars with strict attention to his duties, in the rank of a knight,\r\ndistinguished himself, also, by the great integrity with which he\r\nadministered the high functions of procurator for a long period in the\r\nseveral provinces intrusted to his charge.  But still he devoted so much\r\nattention to literary pursuits, that it would not have been an easy\r\nmatter for a person who enjoyed entire leisure to have written more than\r\nhe did.  He comprised, in twenty volumes, an account of all the various\r\nwars carried on in successive periods with the German tribes.  Besides\r\nthis, he wrote a Natural History, which extended to seven books.  He fell\r\na victim to the calamitous event which occurred in Campania.  For, having\r\nthe command of the fleet at Misenum, when Vesuvius was throwing up a\r\nfiery eruption, he put to sea with his gallies for the purpose of\r\nexploring the causes of the phenomenon close on the spot [986].  But\r\nbeing prevented by contrary winds from sailing back, he was suffocated in\r\nthe dense cloud of dust and ashes.  Some, however, think that he was\r\nkilled by his slave, having implored him to put an end to his sufferings,\r\nwhen he was reduced to the last extremity by the fervent heat.

Political circumstances again\r\nconcurred with popular superstition to revive this posthumous adulation in\r\nfavour of Julius Caesar, the founder of the empire, who also fell by the\r\nhands of conspirators.

But his debts increased so much after this period, if we\r\nmay believe Appian, that upon his departure for Spain, at the expiration\r\nof his praetorship, he is reported to have said, Bis millies et\r\nquingenties centena minis sibi adesse oportere, ut nihil haberet: i. e.\r\nThat he was 2,000,000 and nearly 20,000 sesterces worse than penniless.\r\nCrassus became his security for 830 talents, about 871,500 pounds.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40:  For his victories in Gallicia and Lusitania, having led his\r\narmy to the shores of the ocean, which had not before been reduced to\r\nsubmission.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41:  Caesar was placed in this dilemma, that if he aspired to a\r\ntriumph, he must remain outside the walls until it took place, while as a\r\ncandidate for the consulship, he must be resident in the city.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42:  Even the severe censor was biassed by political expediency\r\nto sanction a system, under which what little remained of public virtue,\r\nand the love of liberty at Rome, were fast decaying.

The Citerior, having nearly the\r\nsame limits as Lombardy in after times, was properly a part of Italy,\r\noccupied by colonists from Gaul, and, having the Rubicon, the ancient\r\nboundary of Italy, on the south.  It was also called Gallia Togata, from\r\nthe use of the Roman toga; the inhabitants being, after the social war,\r\nadmitted to the right of citizens.  The Gallia Transalpina, or Ulterior,\r\nwas called Comata, from the people wearing their hair long, while the\r\nRomans wore it short; and the southern part, afterwards called\r\nNarbonensis, came to have the epithet Braccata, from the use of the\r\nbraccae, which were no part of the Roman dress.  Some writers suppose the\r\nbraccae to have been breeches, but Aldus, in a short disquisition on the\r\nsubject, affirms that they were a kind of upper dress.

These cruel\r\nspectacles were prohibited by Constantine, but not entirely suppressed\r\nuntil the time of Honorius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66:  The Circensian games were shews exhibited in the Circus\r\nMaximus, and consisted of various kinds: first, chariot and horse-races,\r\nof which the Romans were extravagantly fond.  The charioteers were\r\ndistributed into four parties, distinguished by the colour of their dress.\r\nThe spectators, without regarding the speed of the horses, or the skill of\r\nthe men, were attracted merely by one or the other of the colours, as\r\ncaprice inclined them.  In the time of Justinian, no less than thirty\r\nthousand men lost their lives at Constantinople, in a tumult raised by a\r\ncontention amongst the partizans of the several colours.  Secondly,\r\ncontests of agility and strength; of which there were five kinds, hence\r\ncalled Pentathlum.  These were, running, leaping, boxing, wrestling, and\r\nthrowing the discus or quoit.  Thirdly, Ludus Trojae, a mock-fight,\r\nperformed by young noblemen on horseback, revived by Julius Caesar, and\r\nfrequently celebrated by the succeeding emperors.  We meet with a\r\ndescription of it in the fifth book of the Aeneid, beginning with the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\nIncedunt pueri, pariterque ante ora parentum Fraenatis lucent in equis:\r\nquos omnis euntes Trinacriae mirata fremit Trojaeque juventus.\r\n\r\nFourthly, Venatio, which was the fighting of wild beasts with one another,\r\nor with men called Bestiarii, who were either forced to the combat by way\r\nof punishment, as the primitive Christians were, or fought voluntarily,\r\neither from a natural ferocity of disposition, or induced by hire.  An\r\nincredible number of animals of various kinds were brought from all\r\nquarters, at a prodigious expense, for the entertainment of the people.\r\nPompey, in his second consulship, exhibited at once five hundred lions,\r\nwhich were all dispatched in five days; also eighteen elephants. Fifthly\r\nthe representation of a horse and foot battle, with that of an encampment\r\nor a siege.  Sixthly, the representation of a sea-fight (Naumachia), which\r\nwas at first made in the Circus Maximus, but afterwards elsewhere.  The\r\ncombatants were usually captives or condemned malefactors, who fought to\r\ndeath, unless saved by the clemency of the emperor.  If any thing unlucky\r\nhappened at the games, they were renewed, and often more than once.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67:  A meadow beyond the Tiber, in which an excavation was made,\r\nsupplied with water from the river.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68:  Julius Caesar was assisted by Sosigenes, an Egyptian\r\nphilosopher, in correcting the calendar.  For this purpose he introduced\r\nan additional day every fourth year, making February to consist of\r\ntwenty-nine days instead of twenty-eight, and, of course, the whole year\r\nto consist of three hundred and sixty-six days.  The fourth year was\r\ndenominated Bissextile, or leap year, because the sixth day before the\r\ncalends, or first of March, was reckoned twice.\r\n\r\nThe Julian year was introduced throughout the Roman empire, and continued\r\nin general use till the year 1582.  But the true correction was not six\r\nhours, but five hours, forty-nine minutes; hence the addition was too\r\ngreat by eleven minutes.  This small fraction would amount in one hundred\r\nyears to three-fourths of a day, and in a thousand years to more than\r\nseven days.  It had, in fact, amounted, since the Julian correction, in\r\n1582, to more than seven days.  Pope Gregory XIII., therefore, again\r\nreformed the calendar, first bringing forward the year ten days, by\r\nreckoning the 5th of October the 15th, and then prescribing the rule which\r\nhas gradually been adopted throughout Christendom, except in Russia, and\r\nthe Greek church generally.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69:  Principally Carthage and Corinth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70:  The Latus Clavus was a broad stripe of purple, on the front\r\nof the toga.

It\r\nwas sometimes given by the acclamations of the soldiers to those who\r\ncommanded them.  2. It was synonymous with conqueror, and the troops\r\nhailed him by that title after a victory.  In both these cases it was\r\nmerely titular, and not permanent, and was generally written after the\r\nproper name, as Cicero imperator, Lentulo imperatore.  3. It assumed a\r\npermanent and royal character first in the person of Julius Caesar, and\r\nwas then generally prefixed to the emperor’s name in inscriptions, as IMP.\r\nCAESAR.

His statue, at the foot of which Caesar fell,\r\nas Plutarch tells us, was placed in it.  We shall find that Augustus\r\ncaused it to be removed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: The stylus, or graphium, was an iron pen, broad at one end,\r\nwith a sharp point at the other, used for writing upon waxen tables, the\r\nleaves or bark of trees, plates of brass, or lead, etc.  For writing upon\r\npaper or parchment, the Romans employed a reed, sharpened and split in the\r\npoint like our pens, called calamus, arundo, or canna.  This they dipped\r\nin the black liquor emitted by the cuttle fish, which served for ink.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96:  It was customary among the ancients, in great extremities\r\nto shroud the face, in order to conceal any symptoms of horror or alarm\r\nwhich the countenance might express.  The skirt of the toga was drawn\r\nround the lower extremities, that there might be no exposure in falling,\r\nas the Romans, at this period, wore no covering for the thighs and legs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97:  Caesar’s dying apostrophe to Brutus is represented in all\r\nthe editions of Suetonius as uttered in Greek, but with some variations.\r\nThe words, as here translated, are Kai su ei ekeinon; kai su teknon.  The\r\nSalmasian manuscript omits the latter clause.  Some commentators suppose\r\nthat the words “my son,” were not merely expressive of the difference of\r\nage, or former familiarity between them, but an avowal that Brutus was the\r\nfruit of the connection between Julius and Servilia, mentioned before\r\n(see p. 33).  But it appears very improbable that Caesar, who had\r\nnever before acknowledged Brutus to be his son, should make so unnecessary\r\nan avowal, at the moment of his death.  Exclusively of this objection, the\r\napostrophe seems too verbose, both for the suddenness and urgency of the\r\noccasion.  But this is not all.  Can we suppose that Caesar, though a\r\nperfect master of Greek, would at such a time have expressed himself in\r\nthat language, rather than in Latin, his familiar tongue, and in which he\r\nspoke with peculiar elegance?  Upon the whole, the probability is, that\r\nthe words uttered by Caesar were, Et tu Brute! which, while equally\r\nexpressive of astonishment with the other version, and even of tenderness,\r\nare both more natural, and more emphatic.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98:  Men’ me servasse, ut essent qui me perderent?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99:  The Bulla, generally made of gold, was a hollow globe,\r\nwhich boys wore upon their breast, pendant from a string or ribbon put\r\nround the neck.

The Psylli were a people of Africa, celebrated\r\nfor sucking the poison from wounds inflicted by serpents, with which that\r\ncountry anciently abounded.  They pretended to be endowed with an\r\nantidote, which rendered their bodies insensible to the virulence of that\r\nspecies of poison; and the ignorance of those times gave credit to the\r\nphysical immunity which they arrogated.  But Celsus, who flourished about\r\nfifty years after the period we speak of, has exploded the vulgar\r\nprejudice which prevailed in their favour.  He justly observes, that the\r\nvenom of serpents, like some other kinds of poison, proves noxious only\r\nwhen applied to the naked fibre; and that, provided there is no ulcer in\r\nthe gums or palate, the poison may be received into the mouth with perfect\r\nsafety.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128:  Strabo informs us that Ptolemy caused it to be deposited\r\nin a golden sarcophagus, which was afterwards exchanged for one of glass,\r\nin which probably Augustus saw the remains.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129:  A custom of all ages and of people the most remote from\r\neach other.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130:  Meaning the degenerate race of the Ptolomean kings.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131:  The naval trophies were formed of the prows of ships.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132:  A.U.C. 721.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133:  Because his father was a Roman and his mother of the race\r\nof the Parthini, an Illyrian tribe.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134:  It was usual at Rome, before the elections, for the\r\ncandidates to endeavour to gain popularity by the usual arts.

Foremost in the procession went musicians of various kinds, singing\r\nand playing triumphal songs.  Next were led the oxen to be sacrificed,\r\nhaving their horns gilt, and their heads adorned with fillets and\r\ngarlands. Then in carriages were brought the spoils taken from the enemy,\r\nstatues, pictures, plate, armour, gold and silver, and brass; with golden\r\ncrowns, and other gifts, sent by the allied and tributary states.  The\r\ncaptive princes and generals followed in chains, with their children and\r\nattendants.  After them came the lictors, having their fasces wreathed\r\nwith laurel, followed by a great company of musicians and dancers dressed\r\nlike Satyrs, and wearing crowns of gold; in the midst of whom was one in a\r\nfemale dress, whose business it was, with his looks and gestures, to\r\ninsult the vanquished.  Next followed a long train of persons carrying\r\nperfumes.  Then came the victorious general, dressed in purple embroidered\r\nwith gold, with a crown of laurel on his head, a branch of laurel in his\r\nright hand, and in his left an ivory sceptre, with an eagle on the top;\r\nhaving his face painted with vermilion, in the same manner as the statue\r\nof Jupiter on festival days, and a golden Bulla hanging on his breast, and\r\ncontaining some amulet, or magical preservative against envy. He stood in\r\na gilded chariot, adorned with ivory, and drawn by four white horses,\r\nsometimes by elephants, attended by his relations, and a great crowd of\r\ncitizens, all in white.  His children used to ride in the chariot with\r\nhim; and that he might not be too much elated, a slave, carrying a golden\r\ncrown sparkling with gems, stood behind him, and frequently whispered in\r\nhis ear, ‘Remember that thou art a man!’  After the general, followed the\r\nconsuls and senators on foot, at least according to the appointment of\r\nAugustus; for they formerly used to go before him.  His Legati and\r\nmilitary Tribunes commonly rode by his side. The victorious army, horse\r\nand foot, came last, crowned with laurel, and decorated with the gifts\r\nwhich they had received for their valour, singing their own and their\r\ngeneral’s praises, but sometimes throwing out railleries against him; and\r\noften exclaiming, ‘Io Triumphe!’ in which they were joined by all the\r\ncitizens, as they passed along.  The oxen having been sacrificed, the\r\ngeneral gave a magnificent entertainment in the Capitol to his friends and\r\nthe chief men of the city; after which he was conducted home by the\r\npeople, with music and a great number of lamps and torches.”--Thomson.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143:  “The Sella Curulis was a chair on which the principal\r\nmagistrates sat in the tribunal upon solemn occasions.

It appears, from\r\nthe reverse of a medal of Augustus, to have been a rotondo, with an open\r\nportico, something like the temple of Vesta.  The statues of the fifty\r\ndaughters of Danae surrounded the portico; and opposite to them were their\r\nhusbands on horseback.  In this temple were preserved some of the finest\r\nworks of the Greek artists, both in sculpture and painting.  Here, in the\r\npresence of Augustus, Horace’s Carmen Seculare was sung by twenty-seven\r\nnoble youths and as many virgins.

Power was afterwards\r\ngranted them to inspect the morals of the people; and from this period the\r\noffice became of great importance.  After Sylla, the election of censors\r\nwas intermitted for about seventeen years.  Under the emperors, the office\r\nof censor was abolished; but the chief functions of it were exercised by\r\nthe emperors themselves, and frequently both with caprice and severity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178:  Young men until they were seventeen years of age, and\r\nyoung women until they were married, wore a white robe bordered with\r\npurple, called Toga Praetexta.  The former, when they had completed this\r\nperiod, laid aside the dress of minority, and assumed the Toga Virilis, or\r\nmanly habit.  The ceremony of changing the Toga was performed with great\r\nsolemnity before the images of the Lares, to whom the Bulla was\r\nconsecrated.  On this occasion, they went either to the Capitol, or to\r\nsome temple, to pay their devotions to the Gods.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179:  Transvectio: a procession of the equestrian order, which\r\nthey made with great splendour through the city, every year, on the\r\nfifteenth of July.  They rode on horseback from the temple of Honour, or\r\nof Mars, without the city, to the Capitol, with wreaths of olive on their\r\nheads, dressed in robes of scarlet, and bearing in their hands the\r\nmilitary ornaments which they had received from their general, as a reward\r\nof their valour.  The knights rode up to the censor, seated on his curule\r\nchair in front of the Capitol, and dismounting, led their horses in review\r\nbefore him.  If any of the knights was corrupt in his morals, had\r\ndiminished his fortune below the legal standard, or even had not taken\r\nproper care of his horse, the censor ordered him to sell his horse, by\r\nwhich he was considered as degraded from the equestrian order.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180:  Pugillaria were a kind of pocket book, so called, because\r\nmemorandums were written or impinged by the styli, on their waxed surface.\r\nThey appear to have been of very ancient origin, for we read of them in\r\nHomer under the name of pinokes.--II. z. 169.\r\n\r\n       Graphas en pinaki ptukto thyrophthora polla.\r\n       Writing dire things upon his tablet’s roll.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 181:  Pullatorum; dusky, either from their dark colour, or their\r\nbeing soiled.

It received its name from thongs (lora\r\ntensa) stretched before it; and was attended in the procession by persons\r\nof the first rank, in their most magnificent apparel.

Fathers, either upon\r\naccount of their age, or their paternal care of the state.  The number\r\nreceived some augmentation under Tullus Hostilius; and Tarquinius Priscus,\r\nthe fifth king of Rome, added a hundred more, who were called Patres\r\nminorum gentium; those created by Romulus being distinguished by the name\r\nof Patres majorum gentium.  Those who were chosen into the senate by\r\nBrutus, after the expulsion of Tarquin the Proud, to supply the place of\r\nthose whom that king had slain, were called Conscripti, i. e. persons\r\nwritten or enrolled among the old senators, who alone were properly styled\r\nPatres.  Hence arose the custom of summoning to the senate those who were\r\nPatres, and those who were Conscripti; and hence also was applied to the\r\nsenators in general the designation of Patres Conscripti, the particle et,\r\nand, being understood to connect the two classes of senators.  In the time\r\nof Julius Caesar, the number of senators was increased to nine hundred,\r\nand after his death to a thousand; many worthless persons having been\r\nadmitted into the senate during the civil wars.  Augustus afterwards\r\nreduced the number to six hundred.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196:  Antonius Musa was a freedman, and had acquired his\r\nknowledge of medicine while a domestic slave; a very common occurrence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197:  A.U.C. 711.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198:  See cc. x. xi. xii. and xiii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199:  One of them was Scipio, the father of Cornelia, whose\r\ndeath is lamented by Propertius, iv. 12.

The populace,\r\nwith the coarse humour which was permitted to vent itself freely at the\r\nspectacles, did not hesitate to apply what was said in the play of the\r\nlewd priest of Cybele, to Augustus, in reference to the scandals attached\r\nto his private character.

When a person did any work, he tucked up\r\nhis toga, and girt it round him.  The toga of the rich and noble was finer\r\nand larger than that of others; and a new toga was called Pexa. None but\r\nRoman citizens were permitted to wear the toga; and banished persons were\r\nprohibited the use of it.  The colour of the toga was white.

But we\r\nfind that there was a weekly fast among the Jews, which is perhaps what is\r\nhere meant; the Sabbatis Jejunium being equivalent to the Naesteuo dis tou\r\nsabbatou, ‘I fast twice in the week’ of the Pharisee, in St. Luke xviii.\r\n12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229:  The Rhaetian wines had a great reputation; Virgil says,\r\n\r\n    ------Ex quo te carmine dicam,\r\n    Rhaetica.\r\n    Georg. ii. 96.]\r\n\r\nThe vineyards lay at the foot of the Rhaetian Alps; their produce, we have\r\nreason to believe, was not a very generous liquor.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230:  A custom in all warm countries; the siesta of the Italians\r\nin later times.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231:  The strigil was used in the baths for scraping the body\r\nwhen in a state of perspiration.

Nor was Romulus after this seen on earth.\r\nThe consternation being at length over, and fine clear weather succeeding\r\nso turbulent a day, when the Roman youth saw the royal seat empty, though\r\nthey readily believed the Fathers who had stood nearest him, that he was\r\ncarried aloft by the storm, yet struck with the dread as it were of\r\norphanage, they preserved a sorrowful silence for a considerable time.\r\nThen a commencement having been made by a few, the whole multitude salute\r\nRomulus a god, son of a god, the king and parent of the Roman city; they\r\nimplore his favour with prayers, that he would be pleased always\r\npropitiously to preserve his own offspring.  I believe that even then\r\nthere were some who silently surmised that the king had been torn in\r\npieces by the hands of the Fathers; for this rumour also spread, but was\r\nnot credited; their admiration of the man and the consternation felt at\r\nthe moment, attached importance to the other report.  By the contrivance\r\nalso of one individual, additional credit is said to have been gained to\r\nthe matter.  For Proculus Julius, whilst the state was still troubled with\r\nregret for the king, and felt incensed against the senators, a person of\r\nweight, as we are told, in any matter, however important, comes forward to\r\nthe assembly.  “Romans,” he said, “Romulus, the father of this city,\r\nsuddenly descending from heaven, appeared to me this day at day-break.\r\nWhile I stood covered with awe, and filled with a religious dread,\r\nbeseeching him to allow me to see him face to face, he said; ‘Go tell the\r\nRomans, that the gods do will, that my Rome should become the capital of\r\nthe world.  Therefore let them cultivate the art of war, and let them know\r\nand hand down to posterity, that no human power shall be able to withstand\r\nthe Roman arms.’  Having said this, he ascended up to heaven.”  It is\r\nsurprising what credit was given to the man on his making this\r\nannouncement, and how much the regret of the common people and army for\r\nthe loss of Romulus, was assuaged upon the assurance of his immortality.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272:  Padua.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273:  Commentators seem to have given an erroneous and\r\nunbecoming sense to Cicero’s exclamation, when they suppose that the\r\nobject understood, as connected with altera, related to himself.  Hope is\r\nnever applied in this signification, but to a young person, of whom\r\nsomething good or great is expected; and accordingly, Virgil, who adopted\r\nthe expression, has very properly applied it to Ascanius:\r\n\r\n    Et juxta Ascanius, magmae spes altera\r\n    Romae.    Aeneid, xii.]\r\n\r\n    And by his side Ascanius took his place,\r\n    The second hope of Rome’s immortal race.]\r\n\r\nCicero, at the time when he could have heard a specimen of Virgil’s\r\nEclogues, must have been near his grand climacteric; besides that, his\r\nvirtues and talents had long been conspicuous, and were past the state of\r\nhope.  It is probable, therefore, that altera referred to some third\r\nperson, spoken of immediately before, as one who promised to do honour to\r\nhis country.  It might refer to Octavius, of whom Cicero at this time,\r\nentertained a high opinion; or it may have been spoken in an absolute\r\nmanner, without reference to any person.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274:  I was born at Mantua, died in Calabria, and my tomb is at\r\nParthenope: pastures, rural affairs, and heroes are the themes of my\r\npoems.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275:  The last members of these two lines, from the commas to\r\nthe end are said to have been supplied by Erotes, Virgil’s librarian.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276:  Carm. i. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277:  “The Medea of Ovid proves, in my opinion, how surpassing\r\nwould have been his success, if he had allowed his genius free scope,\r\ninstead of setting bounds to it.”]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278:  Two faults have ruined me; my verse, and my mistake.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279:  These lines are thus rendered in the quaint version of\r\nZachary Catlin.\r\n\r\n    I suffer ‘cause I chanced a fault to spy,\r\n    So that my crime doth in my eyesight lie.\r\n\r\n    Alas! why wait my luckless hap to see\r\n    A fault at unawares to ruin me?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280:  “I myself employed you as ready agents in love, when my\r\nearly youth sported in numbers adapted to it.”--Riley’s Ovid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281:  “I long since erred by one composition; a fault that is\r\nnot recent endures a punishment inflicted thus late.

It was only by special privilege that individuals\r\nwho had deserved well of the state, and certain distinguished families\r\nwere permitted to have tombs within the city.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285:  Among the Romans, all the descendants from one common\r\nstock were called Gentiles, being of the same race or kindred, however\r\nremote.  The Gens, as they termed this general relation or clanship, was\r\nsubdivided into families, in Familias vel Stirpes; and those of the same\r\nfamily were called Agnati.  Relations by the father’s side were also\r\ncalled Agnati, to distinguish them from Cognati, relations only by the\r\nmother’s side. An Agnatus might also be called Cognatus, but not the\r\ncontrary.]\r\n\r\nTo mark the different gentes and familiae, and to distinguish the\r\nindividuals of the same family, the Romans had commonly three names, the\r\nPraenomen, Nomen, and Cognomen.  The praenomen was put first, and marked\r\nthe individual.  It was usually written with one letter; as A. for Aulus;\r\nC. Caius; D. Decimus: sometimes with two letters; as Ap. for Appius; Cn.\r\nCneius; and sometimes with three; as Mam. for Mamercus.]\r\n\r\nThe Nomen was put after the Praenomen, and marked the gens.  It commonly\r\nended in ius; as Julius, Tullius, Cornelius.  The Cognomen was put last,\r\nand marked the familia; as Cicero, Caesar, etc.]\r\n\r\nSome gentes appear to have had no surname, as the Marian; and gens and\r\nfamilia seem sometimes to be put one for the other; as the Fabia gens, or\r\nFabia familia.]\r\n\r\nSometimes there was a fourth name, properly called the Agnomen, but\r\nsometimes likewise Cognomen, which was added on account of some\r\nillustrious action or remarkable event.  Thus Scipio was named Publius\r\nCornelius Scipio Africanus, from the conquest of Carthage.  In the same\r\nmanner, his brother was called Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus.  Thus\r\nalso, Quintus Fabius Maximus received the Agnomen of Cunctator, from his\r\nchecking the victorious career of Hannibal by avoiding a battle.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 286:  A.U.C. 474.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 287:  A.U.C. 490.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 288:  A.U.C. 547.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 289:  A.U.C. 304.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 290:  An ancient Latin town on the Via Appia, the present road\r\nto Naples, mentioned by St. Paul, Acts xxviii. 15, and Horace, Sat. i. 5,\r\n3, in giving an account of their travels.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 291:  A.U.C. 505.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 292:  Cybele; first worshipped in Phrygia, about Mount Ida, from\r\nwhence a sacred stone, the symbol of her divinity, probably an aerolite,\r\nwas transported to Rome, in consequence of the panic occasioned by\r\nHannibal’s invasion, A.U.C. 508.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 293:  A.U.C. 695.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 294:  A.U.C. 611.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 295:  A.U.C. 550.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 296:  A.U.C. 663.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 297:  A.U.C. 707.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 298:  These, and other towns in the south of France, became, and\r\nlong continued, the chief seats of Roman civilization among the Gauls;\r\nwhich is marked by the magnificent remains of ancient art still to be\r\nseen.

The course of\r\none of these rivulets was forty miles, and it was carried on arches,\r\nimmediately after quitting its source, for a distance of three miles.  The\r\nother, the Anio Novus, also began on arches, which continued for upwards\r\nof twelve miles.  After this, both were conveyed under ground; but at the\r\ndistance of six miles from the city, they were united, and carried upon\r\narches all the rest of the way.  This is the most perfect of all the\r\nancient aqueducts; and it has been repaired, so as to convey the Acqua\r\nFelice, one of the three streams which now supply Rome.

The remains of the Amphitheatrum Castrense stand\r\nbetween the Porta Maggiore and S. Giovanni, formerly without the ancient\r\nwalls, but now included in the line.  It is all of brick, even the\r\nCorinthian pillars, and seems to have been but a rude structure, suited to\r\nthe purpose for which it was built, the amusement of the soldiers, and\r\ngymnastic exercises.  For this purpose they were used to construct\r\ntemporary amphitheatres near the stations in the distant provinces, which\r\nwere not built of stone or brick, but hollow circular spots dug in the\r\nground, round which the spectators sat on the declivity, on ranges of\r\nseats cut in the sod.

Some were called Secutores, whose arms were a helmet, a\r\nshield, a sword, or a leaden ball.  Others, the usual antagonists of the\r\nformer, were named Retiarii.  A combatant of this class was dressed in a\r\nshort tunic, but wore nothing on his head.  He carried in his left hand a\r\nthree-pointed lance, called Tridens or Fuscina, and in his right, a net,\r\nwith which he attempted to entangle his adversary, by casting it over his\r\nhead, and suddenly drawing it together; when with his trident he usually\r\nslew him.  But if he missed his aim, by throwing the net either too short\r\nor too far, he instantly betook himself to flight, and endeavoured to\r\nprepare his net for a second cast.

The one here mentioned was erected by Caligula in his Circus,\r\nafterwards called the Circus of Nero.  It stood at Heliopolis, having been\r\ndedicated to the sun, as Herodotus informs us, by Phero, son of Sesostris,\r\nin acknowledgment of his recovery from blindness.  It was removed by Pope\r\nSixtus V. in 1586, under the celebrated architect, Fontana, to the centre\r\nof the area before St. Peter’s, in the Vatican, not far from its former\r\nposition.  This obelisk is a solid piece of red granite, without\r\nhieroglyphics, and, with the pedestal and ornaments at the top, is 182\r\nfeet high.  The height of the obelisk itself is 113 palms, or 84 feet.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 511:  Pliny relates some curious particulars of this ship: “A\r\nfir tree of prodigious size was used in the vessel which, by the command\r\nof Caligula, brought the obelisk from Egypt, which stands in the Vatican\r\nCircus, and four blocks of the same sort of stone to support it.  Nothing\r\ncertainly ever appeared on the sea more astonishing than this vessel;\r\n120,000 bushels of lentiles served for its ballast; the length of it\r\nnearly equalled all the left side of the port of Ostia; for it was sent\r\nthere by the emperor Claudius.

The water being low, it lodged in the bed of the stream, and\r\ngradual deposits of mud raising it above the level of the water, it was in\r\ncourse of time covered with buildings.

The antagonism between Christianity and\r\nJudaism appears to have given rise to the tumults which first led the\r\nauthorities to interfere.  Thus much we seem to learn from both passages:\r\nbut the most enlightened men of that age were singularly ill-informed on\r\nthe stupendous events which had recently occurred in Judaea, and we find\r\nSuetonius, although he lived at the commencement of the first century of\r\nthe Christian aera, when the memory of these occurrences was still fresh,\r\nand it might be supposed, by that time, widely diffused, transplanting\r\nChrist from Jerusalem to Rome, and placing him in the time of Claudius,\r\nalthough the crucifixion took place during the reign of Tiberius.\r\n\r\nSt. Luke, Acts xviii. 2, mentions the expulsion of the Jews from Rome by\r\nthe emperor Claudius: Dio, however, says that he did not expel them, but\r\nonly forbad their religious assemblies.\r\n\r\nIt was very natural for Suetonius to write Chrestus instead of Christus,\r\nas the former was a name in use among the Greeks and Romans.

There were likewise publici penates,\r\nworshipped in the Capitol, and supposed to be the guardians of the city\r\nand temples.  Some have thought that the lares and penates were the same;\r\nand they appear to be sometimes confounded.  They were, however,\r\ndifferent.  The penates were reputed to be of divine origin; the lares, of\r\nhuman.  Certain persons were admitted to the worship of the lares, who\r\nwere not to that of the penates.  The latter, as has been already said,\r\nwere worshipped only in the innermost part of the house, but the former\r\nalso in the public roads, in the camp, and on sea.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 602:  A play upon the Greek word moros, signifying a fool, while\r\nthe Latin morari, from moror, means “to dwell,” or “continue.”]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 603:  A small port between the gulf of Baiae and cape Misenum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 604:  From whence the “Procul, O procul este profani!” of the\r\npoet; a warning which was transferred to the Christian mysteries.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 605:  See before, c. xii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 606:  Statilius Taurus; who lived in the time of Augustus, and\r\nbuilt the amphitheatre called after his name.

Tacitus adds another\r\ncause, the insupportable tyranny and avarice of the centurions and\r\nsoldiers.

It was here that Alaric entered.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 627:  The Via Nomentana, so named because it led to the Sabine\r\ntown of Nomentum, joined the Via Salara at Heretum on the Tiber.

It was easy\r\nfor Nero to gain the nearest gate, the Nomentan, from the Esquiline\r\nquarter of the palace, without much observation; and on issuing from it\r\n(after midnight, it appears), the fugitives would have the pretorian camp\r\nso close on their right hand, that they might well hear the shouts of the\r\nsoldiers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 629:  Decocta.

There was at Rome a body of\r\npriests, or college, under this title, whose office it was to foretell\r\nfuture events, chiefly from the flight, chirping, or feeding of birds, and\r\nfrom other appearances.  They were of the greatest authority in the Roman\r\nstate; for nothing of importance was done in public affairs, either at\r\nhome or abroad, in peace or war, without consulting them.  The Romans\r\nderived the practice of augury chiefly from the Tuscans; and anciently\r\ntheir youth used to be instructed as carefully in this art, as afterwards\r\nthey were in the Greek literature.  For this purpose, by a decree of the\r\nsenate, a certain number of the sons of the leading men at Rome was sent\r\nto the twelve states of Etruria for instruction.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 677:  See before, note, c. i. The Principia was a broad open\r\nspace, which separated the lower part of the Roman camp from the upper,\r\nand extended the whole breadth of the camp.  In this place was erected the\r\ntribunal of the general, when he either administered justice or harangued\r\nthe army.  Here likewise the tribunes held their courts, and punishments\r\nwere inflicted.  The principal standards of the army, as it has been\r\nalready mentioned, were deposited in the Principia; and in it also stood\r\nthe altars of the gods, and the images of the Emperors, by which the\r\nsoldiers swore.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 678:  See NERO, c. xxxi.

A statue of\r\nher, brought from Pessinus in Phrygia to Rome, in the time of the second\r\nPunic war, was much honoured there.  Her priests, called the Galli and\r\nCorybantes, were castrated; and worshipped her with the sound of drums,\r\ntabors, pipes, and cymbals.

Lenis was only a tribune\r\nof the thirteenth legion, the position of which in the battle is mentioned\r\nby Tacitus, Hist. xi. 24, and was angusticlavius, wearing only the narrow\r\nstripe, as not being of the senatorial order; while Paulinus was a\r\ngeneral, commanding a legion, at least, and a consular man; having filled\r\nthat Office A.U.C. 818.

V. xiii. 3., mentions this ancient\r\nprediction, and its currency through the East, in nearly the same terms as\r\nSuetonius. The coming power is in both instances described in the plural\r\nnumber, profecti; “those shall come forth;” and Tacitus applies it to\r\nTitus as well as Vespasian.  The prophecy is commonly supposed to have\r\nreference to a passage in Micah, v. 2, “Out of thee (Bethlehem-Ephrata)\r\nshall He come forth, to be ruler in Israel.”  Earlier prophetic\r\nintimations of a similar character, and pointing to a more extended\r\ndominion, have been traced in the sacred records of the Jews; and there is\r\nreason to believe that these books were at this time not unknown in the\r\nheathen world, particularly at Alexandria, and through the Septuagint\r\nversion.  These predictions, in their literal sense, point to the\r\nestablishment of a universal monarchy, which should take its rise in\r\nJudaea.  The Jews looked for their accomplishment in the person of one of\r\ntheir own nation, the expected Messiah, to which character there were many\r\npretenders in those times.  The first disciples of Christ, during the\r\nwhole period of his ministry, supposed that they were to be fulfilled in\r\nhim.  The Romans thought that the conditions were answered by Vespasian,\r\nand Titus having been called from Judaea to the seat of empire.  The\r\nexpectations entertained by the Jews, and naturally participated in and\r\nappropriated by the first converts to Christianity, having proved\r\ngroundless, the prophecies were subsequently interpreted in a spiritual\r\nsense.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 736:  Gessius Florus was at that time governor of Judaea, with\r\nthe title and rank of prepositus, it not being a proconsular province, as\r\nthe native princes still held some parts of it, under the protection and\r\nwith the alliance of the Romans.

It also appears, from his account, that Vespasian offered\r\nsacrifice on Mount Carmel, where Basilides, mentioned hereafter, c. vii.,\r\npredicted his success from an inspection of the entrails.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 741:  Josephus, the celebrated Jewish historian, who was engaged\r\nin these wars, having been taken prisoner, was confined in the dungeon at\r\nJotapata, the castle referred to in the preceding chapter, before which\r\nVespasian was wounded.--De Bell. cxi. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 742:  The prediction of Josephus was founded on the Jewish\r\nprophecies mentioned in the note to c. iv., which he, like others, applied\r\nto Vespasian.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 743:  Julius Caesar is always called by our author after his\r\napotheosis, Divus Julius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 744:  The battle at Bedriacum secured the Empire for Vitellius.\r\nSee OTHO, c. ix; VITELLIUS, c. x.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 745:  Alexandria may well be called the key, claustra, of Egypt,\r\nwhich was the granary of Rome.  It was of the first importance that\r\nVespasian should secure it at this juncture.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 746:  Tacitus describes Basilides as a man of rank among the\r\nEgyptians, and he appears also to have been a priest, as we find him\r\nofficiating at Mount Carmel, c. v.  This is so incompatible with his being\r\na Roman freedman, that commentators concur in supposing that the word\r\n“libertus.” although found in all the copies now extant, has crept into\r\nthe text by some inadvertence of an early transcriber.  Basilides appears,\r\nlike Philo Judaeus, who lived about the same period, to have been\r\nhalf-Greek, half-Jew, and to have belonged to the celebrated Platonic\r\nschool of Alexandria.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 747:  Tacitus informs us that Vespasian himself believed\r\nBasilides to have been at this time not only in an infirm state of health,\r\nbut at the distance of several days’ journey from Alexandria.  But (for\r\nhis greater satisfaction) he strictly examined the priests whether\r\nBasilides had entered the temple on that day: he made inquiries of all he\r\nmet, whether he had been seen in the city; nay, further, he dispatched\r\nmessengers on horseback, who ascertained that at the time specified,\r\nBasilides was more than eighty miles from Alexandria.  Then Vespasian\r\ncomprehended that the appearance of Basilides, and the answer to his\r\nprayers given through him, were by divine interposition.  Tacit. Hist. iv.\r\n82. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 748:  The account given by Tacitus of the miracles of Vespasian\r\nis fuller than that of Suetonius, but does not materially vary in the\r\ndetails, except that, in his version of the story, he describes the\r\nimpotent man to be lame in the hand, instead of the leg or the knee, and\r\nadds an important circumstance in the case of the blind man, that he was\r\n“notus tabe occulorum,” notorious for the disease in his eyes.  He also\r\nwinds up the narrative with the following statement: “They who were\r\npresent, relate both these cures, even at this time, when there is nothing\r\nto be gained by lying.”  Both the historians lived within a few years of\r\nthe occurrence, but their works were not published until advanced periods\r\nof their lives.  The closing remark of Tacitus seems to indicate that, at\r\nleast, he did not entirely discredit the account; and as for Suetonius,\r\nhis pages are as full of prodigies of all descriptions, related apparently\r\nin all good faith, as a monkish chronicle of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe story has the more interest, as it is one of the examples of\r\nsuccessful imposture, selected by Hume in his Essay on Miracles; with the\r\nreply to which by Paley, in his Evidences of Christianity, most readers\r\nare familiar.  The commentators on Suetonius agree with Paley in\r\nconsidering the whole affair as a juggle between the priests, the\r\npatients, and, probably, the emperor.  But what will, perhaps, strike the\r\nreader as most remarkable, is the singular coincidence of the story with\r\nthe accounts given of several of the miracles of Christ; whence it has\r\nbeen supposed, that the scene was planned in imitation of them.  It did\r\nnot fall within the scope of Dr. Paley’s argument to advert to this; and\r\nour own brief illustration must be strictly confined within the limits of\r\nhistorical disquisition.  Adhering to this principle, we may point out\r\nthat if the idea of plagiarism be accepted, it receives some confirmation\r\nfrom the incident related by our author in a preceding paragraph, forming,\r\nit may be considered, another scene of the same drama, where we find\r\nBasilides appearing to Vespasian in the temple of Serapis, under\r\ncircumstances which cannot fail to remind us of Christ’s suddenly standing\r\nin the midst of his disciples, “when the doors were shut.”  This incident,\r\nalso, has very much the appearance of a parody on the evangelical history.\r\nBut if the striking similarity of the two narratives be thus accounted\r\nfor, it is remarkable that while the priests of Alexandria, or, perhaps,\r\nVespasian himself from his residence in Judaea, were in possession of such\r\nexact details of two of Christ’s miracles--if not of a third striking\r\nincident in his history--we should find not the most distant allusion in\r\nthe works of such cotemporary writers as Tacitus and Suetonius, to any one\r\nof the still more stupendous occurrences which had recently taken place in\r\na part of the world with which the Romans had now very intimate relations.\r\nThe character of these authors induces us to hesitate in adopting the\r\nnotion, that either contempt or disbelief would have led them to pass over\r\nsuch events, as altogether unworthy of notice; and the only other\r\ninference from their silence is, that they had never heard of them.  But\r\nas this can scarcely be reconciled with the plagiarism attributed to\r\nVespasian or the Egyptian priests, it is safer to conclude that the\r\ncoincidence, however singular, was merely fortuitous.  It may be added\r\nthat Spartianus, who wrote the lives of Adrian and succeeding emperors,\r\ngives an account of a similar miracle performed by that prince in healing\r\na blind man.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 749:  A.U.C. 823-833, excepting 826 and 831.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 750:  The temple of Peace, erected A.D. 71, on the conclusion of\r\nthe wars with the Germans and the Jews, was the largest temple in Rome.\r\nVespasian and Titus deposited in it the sacred vessels and other spoils\r\nwhich were carried in their triumph after the conquest of Jerusalem. They\r\nwere consumed, and the temple much damaged, if not destroyed, by fire,\r\ntowards the end of the reign of Commodus, in the year 191.  It stood in\r\nthe Forum, where some ruins on a prodigious scale, still remaining, were\r\ntraditionally considered to be those of the Temple of Peace, until\r\nPiranesi contended that they are part of Nero’s Golden House.  Others\r\nsuppose that they are the remains of a Basilica.  A beautiful fluted\r\nCorinthian column, forty-seven feet high, which was removed from this\r\nspot, and now stands before the church of S. Maria Maggiore, gives a great\r\nidea of the splendour of the original structure.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 751:  This temple, converted into a Christian church by pope\r\nSimplicius, who flourished, A.D. 464-483, preserves much of its ancient\r\ncharacter.

From this scale, similar\r\ncalculations may easily be made of the sums occurring in Suetonius’s\r\nstatements from time to time.

Jud. vii.\r\n24.  It is commemorated by the triumphal monument called the Arch of\r\nTitus, erected by the senate and people of Rome after his death, and still\r\nstanding at the foot of the Palatine Hill, on the road leading from the\r\nColosseum to the Forum, and is one of the most beautiful as well as the\r\nmost interesting models of Roman art.  It consists of four stories of the\r\nthree orders of architecture, the Corinthian being repeated in the two\r\nhighest.  Some of the bas-reliefs, still in good preservation, represent\r\nthe table of the shew-bread, the seven-branched golden candlestick, the\r\nvessel of incense, and the silver trumpets, which were taken by Titus from\r\nthe Temple at Jerusalem, and, with the book of the law, the veil of the\r\ntemple, and other spoils, were carried in the triumph.  The fate of these\r\nsacred relics is rather interesting.  Josephus says, that the veil and\r\nbooks of the law were deposited in the Palatium, and the rest of the\r\nspoils in the Temple of Peace.  When that was burnt, in the reign of\r\nCommodus, these treasures were saved, and they were afterwards carried off\r\nby Genseric to Africa.  Belisarius recovered them, and brought them to\r\nConstantinople, A.D. 520.  Procopius informs us, that a Jew, who saw them,\r\ntold an acquaintance of the emperor that it would not be advisable to\r\ncarry them to the palace at Constantinople, as they could not remain\r\nanywhere else but where Solomon had placed them.  This, he said, was the\r\nreason why Genseric had taken the Palace at Rome, and the Roman army had\r\nin turn taken that of the Vandal kings.  Upon this, the emperor was so\r\nalarmed, that he sent the whole of them to the Christian churches at\r\nJerusalem.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 783:  A.U.C. 825.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 784:  A.U.C. 824.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 785:  A.U.C. 823, 825, 827-830, 832.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 786:  Berenice, whose name is written by our author and others\r\nBeronice, was daughter of Agrippa the Great, who was by Aristobulus,\r\ngrandson of Herod the Great.  Having been contracted to Mark, son of\r\nAlexander Lysimachus, he died before their union, and Agrippa married her\r\nto Herod, Mark’s brother, for whom he had obtained from the emperor\r\nClaudius the kingdom of Chalcis.  Herod also dying, Berenice, then a\r\nwidow, lived with her brother, Agrippa, and was suspected of an incestuous\r\nintercourse with him.  It was at this time that, on their way to the\r\nimperial court at Rome, they paid a visit to Festus, at Caesarea, and were\r\npresent when St. Paul answered his accusers so eloquently before the\r\ntribunal of the governor.  Her fascinations were so great, that, to shield\r\nherself from the charge of incest, she prevailed on Polemon, king of\r\nCilicia, to submit to be circumcised, become a Jew, and marry her.  That\r\nunion also proving unfortunate, she appears to have returned to Jerusalem,\r\nand having attracted Vespasian by magnificent gifts, and the young Titus\r\nby her extraordinary beauty, she followed them to Rome, after the\r\ntermination of the Jewish war, and had apartments in the palace, where she\r\nlived with Titus, “to all appearance, as his wife,” as Xiphilinus informs\r\nus; and there seems no doubt that he would have married her, but for the\r\nstrong prejudices of the Romans against foreign alliances. Suetonius tells\r\nus with what pain they separated.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 787:  The Colosseum: it had been four years in building.  See\r\nVESPAS. c. ix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 788:  The Baths of Titus stood on the Esquiline Hill, on part of\r\nthe ground which had been the gardens of Mecaenas.  Considerable remains\r\nof them are still found among the vineyards; vaulted chambers of vast\r\ndimensions, some of which were decorated with arabesque paintings, still\r\nin good preservation.  Titus appears to have erected a palace for himself\r\nadjoining; for the Laocoon, which is mentioned by Pliny as standing in\r\nthis palace, was found in the neighbouring ruins.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 789:  If the statements were not well attested, we might be\r\nincredulous as to the number of wild beasts collected for the spectacles\r\nto which the people of Rome were so passionately devoted.  The earliest\r\naccount we have of such an exhibition, was A.U.C. 502, when one hundred\r\nand forty-two elephants, taken in Sicily, were produced.  Pliny, who gives\r\nthis information, states that lions first appeared in any number, A.U.C.\r\n652; but these were probably not turned loose.  In 661, Sylla, when he was\r\npraetor, brought forward one hundred.  In 696, besides lions, elephants,\r\nand bears, one hundred and fifty panthers were shown for the first time.\r\nAt the dedication of Pompey’s Theatre, there was the greatest exhibition\r\nof beasts ever then known; including seventeen elephants, six hundred\r\nlions, which were killed in the course of five days, four hundred and ten\r\npanthers, etc.  A rhinoceros also appeared for the first time.  This was\r\nA.U.C. 701.  The art of taming these beasts was carried to such\r\nperfection, that Mark Antony actually yoked them to his carriage.  Julius\r\nCaesar, in his third dictatorship, A.U.C. 708, showed a vast number of\r\nwild beasts, among which were four hundred lions and a cameleopard.  A\r\ntiger was exhibited for the first time at the dedication of the Theatre of\r\nMarcellus, A.U.C. 743.  It was kept in a cage.  Claudius afterwards\r\nexhibited four together.  The exhibition of Titus, at the dedication of\r\nthe Colosseum, here mentioned by Suetonius, seems to have been the largest\r\never made; Xiphilinus even adds to the number, and says, that including\r\nwild-boars, cranes, and other animals, no less than nine thousand were\r\nkilled.  In the reigns of succeeding emperors, a new feature was given to\r\nthese spectacles, the Circus being converted into a temporary forest, by\r\nplanting large trees, in which wild animals were turned loose, and the\r\npeople were allowed to enter the wood and take what they pleased.  In this\r\ninstance, the game consisted principally of beasts of chase; and, on one\r\noccasion, one thousand stags, as many of the ibex, wild sheep (mouflions\r\nfrom Sardinia?), and other grazing animals, besides one thousand wild\r\nboars, and as many ostriches, were turned loose by the emperor Gordian.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 790:  “Diem perdidi.”  This memorable speech is recorded by\r\nseveral other historians, and praised by Eusebius in his Chronicles.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 791:  A.U.C. 832, A.D. 79.

Lucan, it appears, employed his\r\nlast hours in revising his poems; on the contrary, Virgil, we are told,\r\nwhen his death was imminent, renewed his directions that the Aeneid should\r\nbe committed to the flames.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 983:  The text of the concluding sentence of Lucan’s life is\r\ncorrupt, and neither of the modes proposed for correcting it make the\r\nsense intended very clear.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 984:  Although this brief memoir of Pliny is inserted in all the\r\neditions of Suetonius, it was unquestionably not written by him.  The\r\nauthor, whoever he was, has confounded the two Plinys, the uncle and\r\nnephew, into which error Suetonius could not have fallen, as he lived on\r\nintimate terms with the younger Pliny; nor can it be supposed that he\r\nwould have composed the memoir of his illustrious friend in so cursory a\r\nmanner.
