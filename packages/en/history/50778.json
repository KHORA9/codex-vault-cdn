PRINTER, CASTLE STREET, FINSBURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n“WILLIAM of MALMESBURY,” according to archbishop Usher, “is the chief\r\nof our historians;” Leland records him “as an elegant, learned, and\r\nfaithful historian;” and Sir Henry Saville is of opinion, that he is\r\nthe only man of his time who has discharged his trust as an historian.\r\nHis History of the Kings of England was translated into English by the\r\nRev. John Sharpe, and published in quarto, in 1815.\r\n\r\nThough the language of Mr. Sharpe’s work is by no means so smooth\r\nas the dialect of the present day would require, yet the care with\r\nwhich he examined MSS., and endeavoured to give the exact sense of\r\nhis author, seemed so important a recommendation, that the editor of\r\nthe present volume has gladly availed himself of it as a ground-work\r\nfor his own labours. The result of this plan is, that the public are\r\nenabled to purchase without delay and at an insignificant expense, the\r\nvaluable contemporary historian, who has hitherto been like a sealed\r\nbook to the public, or only accessible through a bulky volume, the\r\nscarcity of which served to exclude it from all but public libraries or\r\nthe studies of the wealthy.\r\n\r\nBut the translation of Mr. Sharpe has by no means been reprinted\r\nverbatim. Within the last ten years a valuable edition of the original\r\ntext, with copious collations of MSS., has been published by the\r\nEnglish Historical Society. This edition has been compared with the\r\ntranslation, and numerous passages retouched and improved. Some\r\ncharters, also, have been added, and a large number of additional\r\nnotes appended at the foot of the pages, together with a few other\r\nimprovements and additions calculated to render this interesting\r\nhistory more acceptable to the reading public.\r\n\r\n            J. A. G.\r\n\r\n  _Bampton, June, 1847._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author whose work is here presented to the public in an English\r\ndress, has, unfortunately, left few facts of a personal nature to be\r\nrecorded of him; and even these can only be casually gleaned from his\r\nown writings. It is indeed much to be regretted that he who wrote\r\nso well on such a variety of topics, should have told so little to\r\ngratify the curiosity of his readers with respect to himself. Every\r\nnotice of such an ardent lover of literature as Malmesbury, must have\r\nbeen interesting to posterity, as a desire to be acquainted with the\r\nhistory of those who have contributed to our instruction or amusement\r\nseems natural to civilized man. With the exception indeed of the\r\nincidental references made by successive chroniclers, who borrowed\r\nfrom his history, there is nothing to be learned of him from extrinsic\r\nsources till the time of Leland, who indignantly observes, that even at\r\nMalmesbury, in his own monastery, they had nearly lost all remembrance\r\nof their brightest ornament.\r\n\r\nTo himself then we are indebted for the knowledge of his being\r\ndescended from both English and Norman parents; his father having\r\nprobably come hither at the conquest. The exact time of his birth\r\ncannot be ascertained; though perhaps an approximation to it may be\r\nmade. In the “Commentary on Jeremiah,”[1] Malmesbury observes, that\r\nhe “had long since, in his youthful days, amused himself with writing\r\nhistory, that he was now forty years of age;” and, in another place, he\r\nmentions a circumstance which occurred “in the time of king Henry;”[2]\r\napparently implying that Henry was then dead. Now, admitting the\r\nexpression of “long since” to denote a period of ten years, this, as\r\nhis “Histories of the Kings” and “of the Prelates” were completed in\r\nthe year 1125, must have been written about 1135, the time of Henry’s\r\ndeath, and would of course place his own birth about 1095 or 1096.[3]\r\n\r\nThe next circumstance to be noticed is, that when a boy, he was placed\r\nin the monastery whence he derived his name, where in due time he\r\nbecame librarian, and, according to Leland, precentor; and ultimately\r\nrefused the dignity of abbat. His death is generally supposed to have\r\ntaken place about 1143; though it is probable that he survived this\r\nperiod some time: for his “Modern History” terminates at the end of\r\nthe year 1142; and it will appear, from a manuscript hereafter to be\r\ndescribed, that he lived at least long enough after its publication to\r\nmake many corrections, alterations, and insertions, in that work as\r\nwell in the other portions of his History.\r\n\r\nWith these facts, meagre as they are, the personal account of him must\r\nclose. But with regard to his literary bent and attainments there is\r\nample store of information in his writings. From his earliest youth\r\nhe gave his soul to study, and to the collecting of books;[4] and\r\nhe visited many of the most celebrated monasteries in the kingdom,\r\napparently in prosecution of this darling propensity. The ardour of\r\nhis curiosity, and the unceasing diligence of his researches, in\r\nthis respect, have perhaps been seldom surpassed. He seems to have\r\nprocured every volume within his reach; and to have carefully examined\r\nand digested its contents, whether divinity, history, biography,\r\npoetry, or classical literature. Of his acquirements as a scholar it\r\nis indeed difficult to speak in terms of sufficient commendation.\r\nThat he had accurately studied nearly all the Roman authors, will be\r\nreadily allowed by the classical reader of his works. From these he\r\neither quotes or inserts so appositely, as to show how thoroughly he\r\nhad imbibed their sense and spirit. His adaptations are ever ready and\r\nappropriate; they incorporate with his narrative with such exactness\r\nthat they appear only to occupy their legitimate place. His knowledge\r\nof Greek is not equally apparent; at least his references to the\r\nwriters of Greece are not so frequent, and even these might probably be\r\nobtained from translations: from this, however, no conclusion can be\r\ndrawn that he did not understand the language. With respect to writers\r\nsubsequent to those deemed classics, his range was so extensive that it\r\nis no easy matter to point out many books which he had not seen, and\r\ncertainly he had perused several which we do not now possess.\r\n\r\nMalmesbury’s love of learning was constitutional: he declares in one of\r\nhis prefaces, that had he turned to any other than literary pursuits,\r\nhe should have deemed it not only disgraceful, but even detrimental to\r\nhis better interest. Again, his commendations of Bede show how much he\r\nvenerated a man of congenial inclinations and studies; and how anxious\r\nhe was to form himself on the same model of accurate investigation and\r\nlaborious research, and to snatch every possible interval from the\r\nperformance of his monastic duties, for the purposes of information and\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nHis industry and application were truly extraordinary. Even to the\r\nmoment when we reluctantly lose sight of him, he is discovered\r\nunceasingly occupied in the correction of his works.[5] In the MSS.\r\nof the “History of the Kings” may be found traces of at least four\r\nseveral editions; and the “History of the Prelates” supplies nearly\r\nas many varieties. And though it may reasonably be imagined that a\r\ngreat portion of the alterations are merely verbal, and of course\r\nimperceptible in a translation, yet they contribute in an extraordinary\r\ndegree to the polish and elegance of his style.[6] Another excellent\r\nfeature of Malmesbury’s literary character is, his love of truth. He\r\nrepeatedly declares that, in the remoter periods of his work, he had\r\nobserved the most guarded caution in throwing all responsibility, for\r\nthe facts he mentions, on the authors from whom he derived them; and\r\nin his own times he avers, that he has recorded nothing that he had\r\nnot either personally witnessed, or learned from the most credible\r\nauthority. Adhering closely to this principle, he seems to have been\r\nfully impressed with the difficulty of relating the transactions of\r\nthe princes, his contemporaries, and on this account he repeatedly\r\napologizes for his omissions. But here is seen his dexterous management\r\nin maintaining an equipoise between their virtues and vices; for he\r\nspares neither William the First, nor his sons who succeeded him:\r\nindeed several of his strictures in the earlier editions of this work,\r\nare so severe, that he afterwards found it necessary to modify and\r\nsoften them.\r\n\r\nHis character and attainments had early acquired a high degree of\r\nreputation among his contemporaries. He was entreated by the monks of\r\nvarious monasteries to write either the history of their foundations,\r\nor the lives of their patron saints. He associated with persons of the\r\nhighest consequence and authority; and in one instance, at least, he\r\ntook a share in the important political transactions of his own times.\r\nRobert earl of Gloucester, the natural son of Henry the First, was\r\nthe acknowledged friend and patron of Malmesbury. This distinguished\r\nnobleman, who was himself a profound scholar, seems to have been the\r\nchief promoter of learning at that period. Several portions of our\r\nauthor’s work are dedicated to him, not merely through motives of\r\npersonal regard, but from the conviction that his attainments as a\r\nscholar would lead him to appreciate its value as a composition, and\r\nthe part which he bore in the transactions of his day, enable him to\r\ndecide on the veracity of its relation.\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated the leading features of Malmesbury’s life, his\r\navocations and attainments, it may not be irrelevant to consider the\r\nform and manner which he has adopted in the history before us. A\r\ndesire to be acquainted with the transactions of their ancestors seems\r\nnatural to men in every stage of society, however rude or barbarous.\r\nThe northern nations, more especially, had their historical traditions,\r\nand the songs of their bards, from the remotest times. Influenced\r\nby this feeling, the Anglo-Saxons turned their attention to the\r\ncomposition of annals very early after their settlement in Britain;\r\nand hence originated that invaluable register the SAXON CHRONICLE,[7]\r\nin which facts are briefly related as they arose;--in chronological\r\norder, indeed, but without comment or observation. After the Norman\r\nconquest, among other objects of studious research in England,\r\nhistory attracted considerable attention, and the form, as well as\r\nthe matter, of the Saxon Chronicle, became the prevailing standard.\r\nIt might readily be supposed that Malmesbury’s genius and attainments\r\nwould with difficulty submit to the shackles of a mere chronological\r\nseries, which afforded no field for the exercise of genius or judgment.\r\nAccordingly, following the bent of his inclination, he struck into a\r\ndifferent and freer path; and to a judicious selection of facts gave\r\nthe added charm of wisdom and experience. It may therefore be useful\r\nto advert to the exemplification of this principle in the scope and\r\ndesign of the work immediately before us. His first book comprises the\r\nexploits of the Anglo-Saxons, from the period of their arrival till the\r\nconsolidation of the empire under the monarchy of Egbert. Herein too\r\nis separately given the history of those powerful but rival kingdoms,\r\nwhich alternately subjugated, or bowed down to the dominion of, each\r\nother, and deluged the country with blood, as the love of conquest or\r\nthe lust of ambition prompted. The second portion of the work continues\r\nthe regal series till the mighty revolution of the Norman conquest.\r\nThe three remaining books are occupied with the reigns of William and\r\nhis sons, including a very interesting account of the first Crusade.\r\nHis Modern History carries the narrative into the turbulent reign of\r\nStephen.\r\n\r\nSuch is the period embraced: and to show these times, “their form\r\nand pressure,” Malmesbury collected every thing within his reach.\r\nHis materials, as he often feelingly laments, were scanty and\r\nconfined, more especially in the earlier annals. The Chronicles of\r\nthat era afforded him but little, yet of that little he has made\r\nthe most, through the diligence of his research and the soundness\r\nof his judgment. His discrimination in selecting, and his skill in\r\narranging, are equally conspicuous. His inexhaustible patience, his\r\nlearning, his desire to perpetuate every thing interesting or useful,\r\nare at all times evident. Sensibly alive to the deficiencies of the\r\nhistorians who preceded him, he constantly endeavours to give a clear\r\nand connected relation of every event. Indeed, nothing escaped his\r\nobservation which could tend to elucidate the manners of the times in\r\nwhich he wrote. History was the darling pursuit of Malmesbury, and more\r\nespecially biographical history, as being, perhaps, the most pleasing\r\nmode of conveying information. He knew the prevailing passion of\r\nmankind for anecdote, and was a skilful master in blending amusement\r\nwith instruction. Few historians ever possessed such power of keeping\r\nalive the reader’s attention; few so ably managed their materials,\r\nor scattered so many flowers by the way. Of his apt delineation of\r\ncharacter, and happy mode of seizing the most prominent features of his\r\npersonages, it is difficult to speak in terms of adequate commendation.\r\nHe does not weary with a tedious detail, “line upon line,” nor does\r\nhe complete his portrait at a sitting. On the contrary, the traits\r\nare scattered, the proportions disunited, the body dismembered, as it\r\nwere; but in a moment some master-stroke is applied, some vivid flash\r\nof Promethean fire animates the canvass, and the perfect figure darts\r\ninto life and expression: hence we have the surly, ferocious snarl\r\nof the Conqueror, and the brutal horse-laugh of Rufus. Malmesbury’s\r\nhistory, indeed, may be called a kind of biographical drama; where, by\r\na skilful gradation of character and variety of personage, the story\r\nis presented entire, though the tediousness of continued narrative is\r\navoided. Again, by saying little on uninteresting topics, and dilating\r\non such as are important, the tale, which might else disgust from the\r\nsupineness or degeneracy of some principal actor, is artfully relieved\r\nby the force of contrast: and the mind, which perhaps recoils with\r\nindignation from the stupid indifference of an Ethelred, hangs, with\r\nfond delight, on the enterprising spirit and exertion of an Ironside.\r\n\r\nIt may be superfluous, perhaps, after enumerating qualities of this\r\nvaried kind, in an author, who gives a connected history of England\r\nfor several centuries, to observe, that readers of every description\r\nmust derive instruction and delight from his labours. Historians,\r\nantiquaries, or philosophers, may drink deeply of the stream which\r\npervades his work, and find their thirst for information gratified.\r\nThe diligent investigator of the earlier annals of his own country,\r\nfinds a period of seven hundred years submitted to his inspection,\r\nand this not merely in a dry detail of events, but in a series of\r\nauthentic historical facts, determined with acuteness, commented on\r\nwith deliberation, and relieved by pleasing anecdote or interesting\r\nepisode. When the narrative flags at home, the attention is roused by\r\nevents transacting abroad, while foreign is so blended with domestic\r\nhistory, that the book is never closed in disgust. The antiquary here\r\nfinds ample field for amusement and instruction in the various notices\r\nof arts, manners, and customs, which occur. The philosopher traces\r\nthe gradual progress of man towards civilization; watches his mental\r\nimprovement, his advance from barbarism to comparative refinement;\r\nand not of man alone, but of government, laws, and arts, as well as\r\nof all those attainments which serve to exalt and embellish human\r\nnature. These are topics carefully, though perhaps only incidentally,\r\nbrought forward; but they are points essentially requisite in every\r\nlegitimate historian. Here, however, it must be admitted, that in the\r\nvolume before us, a considerable portion of the marvellous prevails;\r\nand though, perhaps, by many readers, these will be considered as among\r\nthe most curious parts of the work, yet it may be objected, that the\r\nnumerous miraculous tales detract, in some measure, from that soundness\r\nof judgment which has been ascribed to our author. But it should be\r\ncarefully recollected, that it became necessary to conform, in some\r\ndegree, to the general taste of the readers of those days, the bulk\r\nof whom derived their principal amusement from the lives of saints,\r\nand from their miracles, in which they piously believed: besides, no\r\none ever thought of impeaching the judgment of Livy, or of any other\r\nhistorian of credit, for insertions of a similar nature. Even in these\r\nrelations, however, Malmesbury is careful that his own veracity shall\r\nnot be impeached; constantly observing, that the truth of the story\r\nmust rest on the credit of his authors; and, indeed, they are always so\r\ncompletely separable from the main narrative, that there is no danger\r\nof mistaking the legend for history.\r\n\r\nHaving thus noticed the multifarious topics embraced by Malmesbury,\r\nit may be necessary to advert to his style: although, after what has\r\nbeen premised, it might seem almost superfluous to add, that it admits\r\nnearly of as much variety as his facts. This probably arises from that\r\nundeviating principle which he appears to have laid down, that his\r\nchief efforts should be exerted to give pleasure to his readers; in\r\nimitation of the rhetoricians, whose first object was to make their\r\naudience kindly disposed, next attentive, and finally anxious to\r\nreceive instruction.[8] Of his style, therefore, generally speaking, it\r\nmay not be easy to give a perfect description. To say to which Roman\r\nauthor it bears the nearest resemblance, when he imitated almost every\r\none of them, from Sallust to Eutropius, would be rash indeed. How shall\r\nwe bind this classical Proteus, who occasionally assumes the semblance\r\nof Persius, Juvenal, Horace, Lucan, Virgil, Lucretius; and who never\r\nappears in his proper shape so long as he can seize the form of an\r\nancient classic?[9] Often does he declare that he purposely varies\r\nhis diction, lest the reader should be disgusted by its sameness;\r\nanxiously careful to avoid repetition, even in the structure of his\r\nphrases. It may be said, however, that generally, in his earlier works,\r\n(for he was apparently very young when he wrote his History of the\r\nKings,) his style is rather laboured; though, perhaps, even this may\r\nhave originated in an anxiety that his descriptions should be full;\r\nor, to use his own expression, that posterity should be wholly and\r\nperfectly informed. That his diction is highly antithetical, and his\r\nsentences artfully poised, will be readily allowed; and perhaps the\r\nbest index to his meaning, where he may be occasionally obscure, is the\r\nnicely-adjusted balance of his phrase. That he gradually improved his\r\nstyle, and in riper years, where he describes the transactions of his\r\nown times, became terse, elegant, and polished, no one will attempt to\r\ndispute; and it will be regretted, that this interesting portion of\r\nhistory should break off abruptly in the midst of the contest between\r\nthe empress Maud and Stephen.\r\n\r\nIn this recapitulation perhaps enough has been said to make an attempt\r\nat translating such an author regarded with kindness and complacency.\r\nTo prevent a work of such acknowledged interest and fidelity from\r\nremaining longer a sealed book to the English reader, may well\r\njustify an undertaking of this kind; and it should be remarked that a\r\ntranslation of Malmesbury may serve to diffuse a very different idea\r\nof the state of manners and learning in his days from that which has\r\nbeen too commonly entertained; and at the same time to rescue a set\r\nof very deserving men from the unjust obloquy with which they have\r\nbeen pursued for ages. For without the least design of vindicating the\r\ninstitutions of monachism or overlooking the abuses incident to it, we\r\nmay assert that, in Malmesbury’s time, religious houses were the grand\r\ndepositaries of knowledge, and monks the best informed men of the age.\r\n\r\nIt remains briefly to speak of the mode in which the translation has\r\nbeen conducted. The printed text of Malmesbury[10] was found so\r\nfrequently faulty and corrupted that, on a careful perusal, it was\r\ndeemed necessary to seek for authentic manuscripts. These were supplied\r\nby that noble institution, the British Museum; but one more especially,\r\nwhich, on an exact comparison with others, was found to possess\r\nindisputable proofs of the author’s latest corrections. This, Bib. Reg.\r\n13, D. II, has been collated throughout with the printed copy; the\r\nresult has produced numerous important corrections, alterations, and\r\ninsertions, which are constantly referred to in the notes. In addition\r\nto this, various other MSS. have been repeatedly consulted; so that it\r\nis presumed the text, from which the translation has been made, is, by\r\nthese means, completely established.\r\n\r\nAs the plan pursued by Malmesbury did not often require him to affix\r\ndates to the several transactions, it has been deemed necessary to\r\nremedy this omission. The chronology here supplied has been constructed\r\non a careful examination and comparison of the Saxon Chronicle and\r\nFlorence of Worcester, which are considered the best authorities;\r\nalthough even these occasionally leave considerable doubt as to the\r\nprecise time of certain events. The remoteness of the period described\r\nby Malmesbury makes notes also in some measure indispensable. These\r\nare derived as frequently as possible from contemporary authors.\r\nTheir object is briefly to amend, to explain, and to illustrate. By\r\nsome perhaps they may be thought too limited; by others they may\r\noccasionally be considered unnecessary; but they are such as were\r\ndeemed likely to be acceptable to readers in general.\r\n\r\nWith these explanations the translator takes leave of the reader,\r\nand is induced to hope that the present work will not be deemed an\r\nunimportant accession to the stock of English literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  EDITOR’S PREFACE.                                                    v\r\n\r\n  THE TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.                                           vi\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHOR’S EPISTLE TO ROBERT, EARL OF GLOUCESTER, SON OF\r\n                    KING HENRY.                                        1\r\n\r\n  PREFACE.                                                             3\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK I.\r\n\r\n    CHAP.

Moreover, it redounds altogether to the glory of\r\nexalted characters, both that they do good, and that they gain the\r\naffection of their inferiors. To you, Princes, therefore, it is owing,\r\nthat we act well; to you, indeed, that we compose anything worthy of\r\nremembrance; your exertions incite us to make you live for ever in\r\nour writings, in return for the dangers you undergo to secure our\r\ntranquillity. For this reason, I have deemed it proper to dedicate the\r\nHistory of the Kings of England, which I have lately published, more\r\nespecially to you, my respected and truly amiable Lord. None, surely,\r\ncan be a more suitable patron of the liberal arts than yourself, in\r\nwhom are combined the magnanimity of your grandfather, the munificence\r\nof your uncle, the circumspection of your father; more especially as\r\nyou add to the qualities of these men, whom you alike equal in industry\r\nand resemble in person, this peculiar characteristic, a devotion to\r\nlearning. Nor is this all: you condescend to honour with your notice\r\nthose literary characters who are kept in obscurity, either by the\r\nmalevolence of fame, or the slenderness of their fortune. And as\r\nour nature inclines us, not to condemn in others what we approve in\r\nourselves, therefore men of learning find in you manners congenial to\r\ntheir own; for, without the slightest indication of moroseness, you\r\nregard them with kindness, admit them with complacency, and dismiss\r\nthem with regret. Indeed, the greatness of your fortune has made no\r\ndifference in you, except that your beneficence can now almost keep\r\npace with your inclination.\r\n\r\nAccept, then, most illustrious Sir, a work in which you may contemplate\r\nyourself as in a glass, where your Highness’s sagacity will discover\r\nthat you have imitated the actions of the most exalted characters,\r\neven before you could have heard their names. The Preface to the first\r\nbook declares the contents of this work; on deigning to peruse which,\r\nyou will briefly collect the whole subject-matter. Thus much I must\r\nrequest from your Excellency, that no blame may attach to me because my\r\nnarrative often wanders wide from the limits of our own country, since\r\nI design this as a compendium of many histories, although, with a view\r\nto the larger portion of it, I have entitled it a History of the Kings\r\nof England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the English, from their arrival in Britain to his\r\nown times, has been written by Bede, a man of singular learning and\r\nmodesty, in a clear and captivating style. After him you will not, in\r\nmy opinion, easily find any person who has attempted to compose in\r\nLatin the history of this people. Let others declare whether their\r\nresearches in this respect have been, or are likely to be, more\r\nfortunate; my own labour, though diligent in the extreme, has, down to\r\nthis period, been without its reward. There, are, indeed, some notices\r\nof antiquity, written in the vernacular tongue after the manner of a\r\nchronicle,[12] and arranged according to the years of our Lord. By\r\nmeans of these alone, the times succeeding this man have been rescued\r\nfrom oblivion: for of Elward,[13] a noble and illustrious man, who\r\nattempted to arrange these chronicles in Latin, and whose intention\r\nI could applaud if his language did not disgust me, it is better to\r\nbe silent. Nor has it escaped my knowledge, that there is also a work\r\nof my Lord Eadmer,[14] written with a chastened elegance of style, in\r\nwhich, beginning from King Edgar, he has but hastily glanced at the\r\ntimes down to William the First: and thence, taking a freer range,\r\ngives a narrative, copious, and of great utility to the studious, until\r\nthe death of Archbishop Ralph.[15] Thus from the time of Bede there is\r\na period of two hundred and twenty-three years left unnoticed in his\r\nhistory; so that the regular series of time, unsupported by a connected\r\nrelation, halts in the middle. This circumstance has induced me, as\r\nwell out of love to my country, as respect for the authority of those\r\nwho have enjoined on me the undertaking, to fill up the chasm, and\r\nto season the crude materials with Roman art. And that the work may\r\nproceed with greater regularity, I shall cull somewhat from Bede, whom\r\nI must often quote, glancing at a few facts, but omitting more.\r\n\r\nThe First Book, therefore, contains a succinct account of the English,\r\nfrom the time of their descent on Britain, till that of King Egbert,\r\nwho, after the different Princes had fallen by various ways, gained the\r\nmonarchy of almost the whole island.\r\n\r\nBut as among the English arose four powerful kingdoms, that is to say,\r\nof Kent, of the West Saxons, of the Northumbrians, and of the Mercians,\r\nof which I purpose severally to treat if I have leisure; I shall begin\r\nwith that which attained the earliest to maturity, and was also the\r\nfirst to decay. This I shall do more clearly, if I place the kingdoms\r\nof the East Angles, and of the East Saxons, after the others, as little\r\nmeriting either my labours, or the regard of posterity.\r\n\r\nThe Second Book will contain the chronological series of the Kings to\r\nthe coming of the Normans.\r\n\r\nThe three following Books will be employed upon the history of three\r\nsuccessive kings, with the addition of whatever, in their times,\r\nhappened elsewhere, which, from its celebrity, may demand a more\r\nparticular notice. This, then, is what I purpose, if the Divine favour\r\nshall smile on my undertaking, and carry me safely by those rocks of\r\nrugged diction, on which Elward, in his search after sounding and\r\nfar-fetched phrases, so unhappily suffered shipwreck. “Should any one,\r\nhowever,” to use the poet’s expression,[16] “peruse this work with\r\nsensible delight,” I deem it necessary to acquaint him, that I vouch\r\nnothing for the truth of long past transactions, but the consonance\r\nof the time; the veracity of the relation must rest with its authors.\r\nWhatever I have recorded of later times, I have either myself seen,\r\nor heard from credible authority. However, in either part, I pay but\r\nlittle respect to the judgment of my contemporaries: trusting that I\r\nshall gain with posterity, when love and hatred shall be no more, if\r\nnot a reputation for eloquence, at least credit for diligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nKINGS OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\n_Of the arrival of the Angles, and of the Kings of Kent._ [A.D. 449.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of the incarnation of our Lord 449, Angles and Saxons\r\nfirst came into Britain; and although the cause of their arrival is\r\nuniversally known, it may not be improper here to subjoin it: and,\r\nthat the design of my work may be the more manifest, to begin even\r\nfrom an earlier period. That Britain, compelled by Julius Cæsar to\r\nsubmit to the Roman power, was held in high estimation by that people,\r\nmay be collected from their history, and be seen also in the ruins of\r\ntheir ancient buildings. Even their emperors, sovereigns of almost\r\nall the world, eagerly embraced opportunities of sailing hither, and\r\nof spending their days here. Finally, Severus and Constantius, two of\r\ntheir greatest princes, died upon the island, and were there interred\r\nwith the utmost pomp. The former, to defend this province from the\r\nincursions of the barbarians, built his celebrated and well-known\r\nwall from sea to sea. The latter, a man, as they report, of courteous\r\nmanners, left Constantine, his son by Helena, a tender of cattle,[17] a\r\nyouth of great promise, his heir. Constantine, greeted emperor by the\r\narmy, led away, in an expedition destined to the continent, a numerous\r\nforce of British soldiers; by whose exertions, the war succeeding\r\nto his wishes, he gained in a short time the summit of power. For\r\nthese veterans, when their toil was over, he founded a colony on the\r\nwestern coast of Gaul, where, to this day, their descendants, somewhat\r\ndegenerate in language and manners from our own Britons, remain with\r\nwonderful increase.[18]\r\n\r\nIn succeeding times, in this island, Maximus, a man well-fitted for\r\ncommand, had he not aspired to power in defiance of his oath, assumed\r\nthe purple, as though compelled by the army, and preparing immediately\r\nto pass over into Gaul, he despoiled the province of almost all its\r\nmilitary force. Not long after also, one Constantine, who had been\r\nelected emperor on account of his name, drained its whole remaining\r\nwarlike strength; but both being slain, the one by Theodosius, the\r\nother by Honorius, they became examples of the instability of human\r\ngreatness. Of the forces which had followed them, part shared the fate\r\nof their leaders; the rest, after their defeat, fled to the continental\r\nBritons. Thus when the tyrants had left none but half-savages in the\r\ncountry, and, in the towns, those only who were given up to luxury,\r\nBritain, despoiled of the support of its youthful[19] population, and\r\nbereft of every useful art, was for a long time exposed to the ambition\r\nof neighbouring nations.\r\n\r\nFor immediately, by an excursion of the Scots and Picts, numbers of the\r\npeople were slain, villages burnt,[20] towns destroyed, and everything\r\nlaid waste by fire and sword. Part of the harassed islanders, who\r\nthought anything more advisable than contending in battle, fled for\r\nsafety to the mountains; others, burying their treasures in the earth,\r\nmany of which are dug up in our own times, proceeded to Rome to ask\r\nassistance. The Romans, touched with pity, and deeming it above all\r\nthings important to yield succour to their oppressed allies, twice lent\r\ntheir aid, and defeated the enemy. But at length, wearied with the\r\ndistant voyage, they declined returning in future; bidding them rather\r\nthemselves not degenerate from the martial energy of their ancestors,\r\nbut learn to defend their country with spirit, and with arms. They\r\naccompanied their advice with the plan of a wall, to be built for their\r\ndefence; the mode of keeping watch on the ramparts; of sallying out\r\nagainst the enemy, should it be necessary, together with other duties\r\nof military discipline. After giving these admonitions, they departed,\r\naccompanied by the tears of the miserable inhabitants; and Fortune,\r\nsmiling on their departure, restored them to their friends and country.\r\nThe Scots, learning the improbability of their return, immediately\r\nbegan to make fresh and more frequent irruptions against the Britons;\r\nto level their wall, to kill the few opponents they met with, and to\r\ncarry off considerable booty; while such as escaped fled to the royal\r\nresidence, imploring the protection of their sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 447.] REIGN OF VORTIGERN.]\r\n\r\nAt this time Vortigern was King of Britain; a man calculated neither\r\nfor the field nor the council, but wholly given up to the lusts of the\r\nflesh, the slave of every vice: a character of insatiable avarice,\r\nungovernable pride, and polluted by his lusts. To complete the picture,\r\nas we read in the History of the Britons, he had defiled his own\r\ndaughter, who was lured to the participation of such a crime by the\r\nhope of sharing his kingdom, and she had borne him a son. Regardless of\r\nhis treasures at this dreadful juncture, and wasting the resources of\r\nthe kingdom in riotous living, he was awake only to the blandishments\r\nof abandoned women. Roused at length, however, by the clamours of the\r\npeople, he summoned a council, to take the sense of his nobility on\r\nthe state of public affairs. To be brief, it was unanimously resolved\r\nto invite over from Germany the Angles and Saxons, nations powerful\r\nin arms, but of a roving life. It was conceived that this would be\r\na double advantage: for it was thought that, by their skill in war,\r\nthese people would easily subdue their enemies; and, as they hitherto\r\nhad no certain habitation, would gladly accept even an unproductive\r\nsoil, provided it afforded them a stationary residence. Moreover, that\r\nthey could not be suspected of ever entertaining a design against the\r\ncountry, since the remembrance of this kindness would soften their\r\nnative ferocity. This counsel was adopted, and ambassadors, men of\r\nrank, and worthy to represent the country, were sent into Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Germans, hearing that voluntarily offered, which they had long\r\nanxiously desired, readily obeyed the invitation; their joy quickening\r\ntheir haste. Bidding adieu, therefore, to their native fields and\r\nthe ties of kindred, they spread their sails to Fortune, and, with a\r\nfavouring breeze, arrived in Britain in three of those long vessels\r\nwhich they call “ceols.”[21] At this and other times came over a\r\nmixed multitude from three of the German nations; that is to say,\r\nthe Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. For almost all the country lying to\r\nthe north of the British ocean, though divided into many provinces,\r\nis justly denominated Germany, from its germinating so many men. And\r\nas the pruner cuts off the more luxuriant branches of the tree to\r\nimpart a livelier vigour to the remainder, so the inhabitants of this\r\ncountry assist their common parent by the expulsion of a part of their\r\nmembers, lest she should perish by giving sustenance to too numerous an\r\noffspring; but in order to obviate discontent, they cast lots who shall\r\nbe compelled to migrate. Hence the men of this country have made a\r\nvirtue of necessity, and, when driven from their native soil, they have\r\ngained foreign settlements by force of arms. The Vandals, for instance,\r\nwho formerly over-ran Africa; the Goths, who made themselves masters\r\nof Spain; the Lombards, who, even at the present time, are settled in\r\nItaly; and the Normans, who have given their own name to that part of\r\nGaul which they subdued. From Germany, then, there first came into\r\nBritain, an inconsiderable number indeed, but well able to make up\r\nfor their paucity by their courage. These were under the conduct of\r\nHengist and Horsa, two brothers of suitable disposition, and of noble\r\nrace in their own country. They were great-grandsons of the celebrated\r\nWoden, from whom almost all the royal families of these barbarous\r\nnations deduce their origin; and to whom the nations of the Angles,\r\nfondly deifying him, have consecrated by immemorial superstition the\r\nfourth day of the week, as they have the sixth to his wife Frea. Bede\r\nhas related in what particular parts of Britain, the Angles, Saxons,\r\nand Jutes,[22] fixed their habitations: my design, however, is not to\r\ndilate, though there may be abundance of materials for the purpose, but\r\nto touch only on what is necessary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 449.] ARRIVAL OF HENGIST.]\r\n\r\nThe Angles were eagerly met on all sides upon their arrival: from the\r\nking they received thanks, from the people expressions of good-will.\r\nFaith was plighted on either side, and the Isle of Thanet appropriated\r\nfor their residence. It was agreed, moreover, that they should exert\r\ntheir prowess in arms for the service of the country; and, in return,\r\nreceive a suitable reward from the people for whose safety they\r\nunderwent such painful labours. Ere long, the Scots advanced, as\r\nusual, secure, as they supposed, of a great booty with very little\r\ndifficulty. However, the Angles assailed them, and scarcely had they\r\nengaged, before they were put to flight, whilst the cavalry pursued\r\nand destroyed the fugitives. Contests of this kind were frequent, and\r\nvictory constantly siding with the Angles, as is customary in human\r\naffairs, while success inflamed the courage of one party, and dread\r\nincreased the cowardice of the other, the Scots in the end avoided\r\nnothing so cautiously as an engagement with them.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Hengist, not less keen in perception than ardent in\r\nthe field, with consent of Vortigern, sends back some of his followers\r\nto his own country, with the secret purpose, however, of representing\r\nthe indolence of the king and people, the opulence of the island,\r\nand the prospect of advantage to new adventurers. Having executed\r\ntheir commission adroitly, in a short time they return with sixteen\r\nships, bringing with them the daughter of Hengist; a maiden, as we\r\nhave heard, who might justly be called the master-piece of nature and\r\nthe admiration of mankind. At an entertainment, provided for them on\r\ntheir return, Hengist commanded his daughter to assume the office of\r\ncup-bearer, that she might gratify the eyes of the king as he sat\r\nat table. Nor was the design unsuccessful: for he, ever eager after\r\nfemale beauty, deeply smitten with the gracefulness of her form and\r\nthe elegance of her motion, instantly conceived a vehement desire for\r\nthe possession of her person, and immediately proposed marriage to her\r\nfather; urging him to a measure to which he was already well inclined.\r\nHengist, at first, kept up the artifice by a refusal; stating, that so\r\nhumble a connection was unworthy of a king: but, at last, appearing\r\nto consent with reluctance, he gave way to his importunities, and\r\naccepted, as a reward, the whole of Kent, where all justice had long\r\nsince declined under the administration of its Gourong (or Viceroy),\r\nwho, like the other princes of the island, was subject to the monarchy\r\nof Vortigern. Not satisfied with this liberality, but abusing the\r\nimprudence of the king, the barbarian persuaded him to send for his\r\nson and brother, men of warlike talents, from Germany, pretending,\r\nthat he would defend the province on the east, while they might curb\r\nthe Scots on the northern frontier. The king assenting, they sailed\r\nround Britain, and arriving at the Orkney Isles, the inhabitants of\r\nwhich they involved in the same calamity with the Picts and Scots, at\r\nthis and after times, they finally settled in the northern part of the\r\nisland, now called Northumbria. Still no one there assumed the royal\r\ntitle or insignia till the time of Ida, from whom sprang the regal line\r\nof the Northumbrians; but of this hereafter. We will now return to the\r\npresent subject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 520.] MASSACRE OF THE BRITISH NOBLES.]\r\n\r\nVortimer, the son of Vortigern, thinking it unnecessary longer to\r\ndissemble that he saw himself and his Britons circumvented by the craft\r\nof the Angles, turned his thoughts to their expulsion, and stimulated\r\nhis father to the same attempt. At his suggestion, the truce was\r\nbroken seven years after their arrival; and during the ensuing twenty,\r\nthey frequently fought partial battles,[23] and, as the chronicle\r\nrelates, four general actions. From the first conflict they parted on\r\nequal terms: one party lamenting the loss of Horsa, the brother of\r\nHengist; the other, that of Katigis, another of Vortigern’s sons. The\r\nAngles, having the advantage in all the succeeding encounters, peace\r\nwas concluded; Vortimer, who had been the instigator of the war, and\r\ndiffered far from the indolence of his father, perished prematurely,\r\nor he would have governed the kingdom in a noble manner, had God\r\npermitted. When he died, the British strength decayed, and all hope\r\nfled from them; and they would soon have perished altogether, had not\r\nAmbrosius, the sole survivor of the Romans, who became monarch after\r\nVortigern, quelled the presumptuous barbarians by the powerful aid of\r\nwarlike Arthur. It is of this Arthur that the Britons fondly tell so\r\nmany fables, even to the present day; a man worthy to be celebrated,\r\nnot by idle fictions, but by authentic history. He long upheld the\r\nsinking state, and roused the broken spirit of his countrymen to war.\r\nFinally, at the siege of Mount Badon,[24] relying on an image of the\r\nVirgin, which he had affixed to his armour, he engaged nine hundred of\r\nthe enemy, single-handed, and dispersed them with incredible slaughter.\r\nOn the other side, the Angles, after various revolutions of fortune,\r\nfilled up their thinned battalions with fresh supplies of their\r\ncountrymen; rushed with greater courage to the conflict, and extended\r\nthemselves by degrees, as the natives retreated, over the whole island:\r\nfor the counsels of God, in whose hand is every change of empire, did\r\nnot oppose their career. But this was effected in process of time; for\r\nwhile Vortigern lived, no new attempt was made against them. About\r\nthis time, Hengist, from that bad quality of the human heart, which\r\ngrasps after more in proportion to what it already possesses, by a\r\npreconcerted piece of deception, invited his son-in-law, with three\r\nhundred of his followers, to an entertainment; and when, by more\r\nthan usual compotations, he had excited them to clamour, he began,\r\npurposely, to taunt them severally, with sarcastic raillery: this had\r\nthe desired effect, of making them first quarrel, and then come to\r\nblows. Thus the Britons were basely murdered to a man, and breathed\r\ntheir last amid their cups. The king himself, made captive, purchased\r\nhis liberty at the price of three provinces. After this, Hengist died,\r\nin the thirty-ninth year after his arrival; he was a man, who urging\r\nhis success not less by artifice than courage, and giving free scope\r\nto his natural ferocity, preferred effecting his purpose rather by\r\ncruelty than by kindness. He left a son named Eisc;[25] who, more\r\nintent on defending, than enlarging, his dominions, never exceeded\r\nthe paternal bounds. At the expiration of twenty-four years, he had\r\nfor his successors, his son Otha, and Otha’s son, Ermenric, who, in\r\ntheir manners, resembled him, rather than their grandfather and great\r\ngrandfather. To the times of both, the Chronicles assign fifty-three\r\nyears; but whether they reigned singly, or together, does not appear.\r\n\r\nAfter them Ethelbert, the son of Ermenric, reigned fifty-three years\r\naccording to the Chronicle; but fifty-six according to Bede. The\r\nreader must determine how this difference is to be accounted for; as\r\nI think it sufficient to have apprized him of it, I shall let the\r\nmatter rest.[26] In the infancy of his reign, he was such an object of\r\ncontempt to the neighbouring kings, that, defeated in two battles, he\r\ncould scarcely defend his frontier; afterwards, however, when to his\r\nriper years he had added a more perfect knowledge of war, he quickly,\r\nby successive victories, subjugated every kingdom of the Angles, with\r\nthe exception of the Northumbrians. And, in order to obtain foreign\r\nconnections, he entered into affinity with the king of France, by\r\nmarrying his daughter Bertha. And now by this connection with the\r\nFranks, the nation, hitherto savage and wedded to its own customs,\r\nbegan daily to divest itself of its rustic propensities and incline to\r\ngentler manners. To this was added the very exemplary life of bishop\r\nLuidhard, who had come over with the queen, by which, though silently,\r\nhe allured the king to the knowledge of Christ our Lord. Hence it\r\narose, that his mind, already softened, easily yielded to the preaching\r\nof the blessed Augustine; and he was the first of all his race who\r\nrenounced the errors of paganism, that he might obscure, by the glory\r\nof his faith, those whom he surpassed in power. This, indeed, is\r\nspotless nobility; this, exalted virtue; to excel in worth those\r\nwhom you exceed in rank. Besides, extending his care to posterity,\r\nhe enacted laws, in his native tongue, in which he appointed rewards\r\nfor the meritorious, and opposed severer restraints to the abandoned,\r\nleaving nothing doubtful for the future.[27]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 618.] EDBALD.]\r\n\r\nEthelbert died in the twenty-first year after he had embraced the\r\nChristian faith, leaving the diadem to his son Edbald. As soon\r\nas he was freed from the restraints of paternal awe, he rejected\r\nChristianity, and overcame the virtue of his stepmother.[28] But\r\nthe severity of the divine mercy opposed a barrier to his utter\r\ndestruction: for the princes, whom his father had subjugated,\r\nimmediately rebelled, he lost a part of his dominions, and was\r\nperpetually haunted by an evil spirit, whereby he paid the penalty of\r\nhis unbelief. Laurentius, the successor of Augustine, was offended at\r\nthese transactions, and after having sent away his companions, was\r\nmeditating his own departure from the country, but having received\r\nchastisement from God, he was induced to change his resolution.[29] The\r\nking conversing with him on the subject, and finding his assertions\r\nconfirmed by his stripes, became easily converted, accepted the grace\r\nof Christianity, and broke off his incestuous intercourse. But, that\r\nposterity might be impressed with the singular punishment due to\r\napostacy, it was with difficulty he could maintain his hereditary\r\ndominions, much less rival the eminence of his father. For the\r\nremainder of his life, his faith was sound, and he did nothing to\r\nsully his reputation. The monastery also, which his father had founded\r\nwithout the walls of Canterbury,[30] he ennobled with large estates,\r\nand sumptuous presents. The praises and merits of both these men ought\r\never to be proclaimed, and had in honour by the English; because they\r\nallowed the Christian faith to acquire strength, in England, by\r\npatient listening and willingness to believe. Who can contemplate,\r\nwithout satisfaction, the just and amiable answer which Bede makes king\r\nEthelbert to have given to the first preaching of Augustine? “That he\r\ncould not, thus early, embrace a new doctrine and leave the accustomed\r\nworship of his country; but that, nevertheless, persons who had\r\nundertaken so long a journey for the purpose of kindly communicating to\r\nthe Angles what they deemed an inestimable benefit, far from meeting\r\nwith ill-treatment, ought rather to be allowed full liberty to preach,\r\nand also to receive the amplest maintenance.” He fully kept his\r\npromise; and at length the truth of Christianity becoming apparent by\r\ndegrees, himself and all his subjects were admitted into the number of\r\nthe faithful. And what did the other? Though led away at first, more by\r\nthe lusts of the flesh than perverseness of heart, yet he paid respect\r\nto the virtuous conduct of the prelates, although he neglected their\r\nfaith; and lastly, as I have related, was easily converted through\r\nthe sufferings of Laurentius, and became of infinite service to the\r\npropagation of Christianity. Both, then, were laudable: both deserved\r\nhigh encomiums; for the good work, so nobly begun by the one, was as\r\nkindly fostered by the other.\r\n\r\nTo him, after a reign of twenty-four years, succeeded Erconbert, his\r\nson, by Emma, daughter of the king of France. He reigned an equal\r\nnumber of years with his father, but under happier auspices; alike\r\nremarkable for piety towards God, and love to his country. For his\r\ngrandfather, and father, indeed, adopted our faith, but neglected to\r\ndestroy their idols; whilst he, thinking it derogatory to his royal\r\nzeal not to take the readiest mode of annihilating openly what they\r\nonly secretly condemned, levelled every temple of their gods to the\r\nground, that not a trace of their paganism might be handed down to\r\nposterity. This was nobly done: for the mass of the people would be\r\nreminded of their superstition, so long as they could see the altars\r\nof their deities. In order, also, that he might teach his subjects,\r\nwho were too much given to sensual indulgence, to accustom themselves\r\nto temperance, he enjoined the solemn fast of Lent to be observed\r\nthroughout his dominions. This was an extraordinary act for the king\r\nto attempt in those times: but he was a man whom no blandishments of\r\nluxury could enervate; no anxiety for power seduce from the worship of\r\nGod. Wherefore he was protected by the favour of the Almighty; every\r\nthing, at home and abroad, succeeded to his wishes, and he grew old in\r\nuninterrupted tranquillity. His daughter Ercongotha, a child worthy of\r\nsuch a parent, and emulating her father in virtuous qualities, became a\r\nshining light in the monastery of Kalas in Gaul.[31]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 664-686.] EGBERT--LOTHERE.]\r\n\r\nHis son Egbert, retaining his father’s throne for nine years, did\r\nnothing memorable in so short a reign; unless indeed it be ascribed\r\nto the glory of this period, that Theodore[32] the archbishop, and\r\nAdrian the abbat, two consummate scholars, came into England in his\r\nreign. Were not the subject already trite, I should willingly record\r\nwhat light they shed upon the Britons; how on one side the Greeks, and\r\non the other the Latins, emulously contributed their knowledge to the\r\npublic stock, and made this island, once the nurse of tyrants, the\r\nconstant residence of philosophy: but this and every other merit of the\r\ntimes of Egbert is clouded by his horrid crime, of either destroying,\r\nor permitting to be destroyed, Elbert and Egelbright, his nephews.[33]\r\n\r\nTo Egbert succeeded his brother Lothere, who began his reign with\r\nunpropitious omens. For he was harassed during eleven years by Edric,\r\nthe son of Egbert, and engaged in many civil conflicts which terminated\r\nwith various success, until he was ultimately pierced through the body\r\nwith a dart, and died while they were applying remedies to the wound.\r\nSome say, that both the brothers perished by a premature death as a\r\njust return for their cruelty; because Egbert, as I have related,\r\nmurdered the innocent children of his uncle; and Lothere ridiculed the\r\nnotion of holding them up as martyrs: although the former had lamented\r\nthe action, and had granted a part of the Isle of Thanet to the mother\r\nof his nephews, for the purpose of building a monastery.\r\n\r\nNor did Edric long boast the prosperous state of his government; for\r\nwithin two years he was despoiled both of kingdom and of life, and\r\nleft his country to be torn in pieces by its enemies. Immediately\r\nCædwalla, with his brother Mull, in other respects a good and able\r\nman, but breathing an inextinguishable hatred against the people of\r\nKent, made vigorous attempts upon the province; supposing it must\r\neasily surrender to his views, as it had lately been in the enjoyment\r\nof long continued peace, but at that time was torn with intestine war.\r\nHe found, however, the inhabitants by no means unprepared or void of\r\ncourage, as he had expected. For, after many losses sustained in the\r\ntowns and villages, at length they rushed with spirit to the conflict.\r\nThey gained the victory in the contest, and having put Cædwalla to\r\nflight, drove his brother Mull into a little cottage, which they set on\r\nfire. Thus, wanting courage to sally out against the enemy, the fire\r\ngained uncontrolled power, and he perished in the flames. Nevertheless\r\nCædwalla ceased not his efforts, nor retired from the province; but\r\nconsoled himself for his losses by repeatedly ravaging the district;\r\nhowever, he left the avenging of this injury to Ina, his successor, as\r\nwill be related in its place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 774-823.] DOWNFALL OF KENT.]\r\n\r\nIn this desperate state of the affairs of Kent, there was a void of\r\nabout six years in the royal succession. In the seventh, Withred, the\r\nson of Egbert, having repressed the malevolence of his countrymen\r\nby his activity, and purchased peace from his enemies by money, was\r\nchosen king by the inhabitants, who entertained great and well-founded\r\nhopes of him. He was an admirable ruler at home, invincible in war,\r\nand a truly pious follower of the Christian faith, for he extended its\r\npower to the utmost. And, to complete his felicity, after a reign of\r\nthirty-three years, he died in extreme old age, which men generally\r\nreckon to be their greatest happiness, leaving his three children\r\nhis heirs. These were Egbert, Ethelbert, and Alric, and they reigned\r\ntwenty-three, eleven, and thirty-four years successively, without\r\ndeviation from the excellent example and institutions of their father,\r\nexcept that Ethelbert, by the casual burning of Canterbury, and Alric,\r\nby an unsuccessful battle with the Mercians, considerably obscured\r\nthe glory of their reigns. So it is that, if any thing disgraceful\r\noccurs, it is not concealed; if any thing fortunate, it is not\r\nsufficiently noticed in the Chronicles; whether it be done designedly,\r\nor whether it arise from that bad quality of the human mind, which\r\nmakes gratitude for good transient; whereas the recollection of evil\r\nremains for ever. After these men the noble stock of kings began to\r\nwither, the royal blood to flow cold. Then every daring adventurer,\r\nwho had acquired riches by his eloquence, or whom faction had made\r\nformidable, aspired to the kingdom, and disgraced the ensigns of\r\nroyalty. Of these, Edbert otherwise called Pren, after having governed\r\nKent two years, over-rating his power, was taken prisoner in a war with\r\nthe Mercians, and loaded with chains. But being set at liberty by his\r\nenemies, though not received by his own subjects, it is uncertain by\r\nwhat end he perished. Cuthred, heir to the same faction and calamity,\r\nreigned, in name only, eight years. Next Baldred, a mere abortion of\r\na king, after having for eighteen years more properly possessed, than\r\ngoverned the kingdom, went into exile, on his defeat by Egbert, king\r\nof the West Saxons. Thus the kingdom of Kent, which, from the year of\r\nour Lord 449, had continued 375 years, became annexed to another. And\r\nsince by following the royal line of the first kingdom which arose\r\namong the Angles, I have elicited a spark, as it were, from the embers\r\nof antiquity, I shall now endeavour to throw light on the kingdom of\r\nthe West Saxons, which, though after a considerable lapse of time, was\r\nthe next that sprang up. While others were neglected and wasted away,\r\nthis flourished with unconquerable vigour, even to the coming of the\r\nNormans; and, if I may be permitted the expression, with greedy jaws\r\nswallowed up the rest. Wherefore, after tracing this kingdom in detail\r\ndown to Egbert, I shall briefly, for fear of disgusting my readers,\r\nsubjoin some notices of the two remaining; this will be a suitable\r\ntermination to the first book, and the second will continue the history\r\nof the West Saxons alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n_Of the kings of the West Saxons._ [A.D. 495.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of the West Saxons,--and one more magnificent or lasting\r\nBritain never beheld,--sprang from Cerdic, and soon increased to great\r\nimportance. He was a German by nation, of the noblest race, being the\r\ntenth from Woden, and, having nurtured his ambition in domestic broils,\r\ndetermined to leave his native land and extend his fame by the sword.\r\nHaving formed this daring resolution he communicated his design to\r\nCenric his son, who closely followed his father’s track to glory, and\r\nwith his concurrence transported his forces into Britain in five ceols.\r\nThis took place in the year of our Saviour’s incarnation 495, and the\r\neighth after the death of Hengist. Coming into action with the Britons\r\nthe very day of his arrival, this experienced soldier soon defeated an\r\nundisciplined multitude, and compelled them to fly. By this success he\r\nobtained perfect security in future for himself, as well as peace for\r\nthe inhabitants of those parts. For they never dared after that day to\r\nattack him, but voluntarily submitted to his dominion. Nevertheless he\r\ndid not waste his time in indolence; but, on the contrary, extending\r\nhis conquests on all sides, by the time he had been twenty-four years\r\nin the island, he had obtained the supremacy of the western part of\r\nit, called West-Saxony. He died after enjoying it sixteen years, and\r\nhis whole kingdom, with the exception of the isle of Wight, descended\r\nto his son. This, by the royal munificence, became subject to his\r\nnephew, Withgar; who was as dear to his uncle by the ties of kindred,\r\nfor he was his sister’s son, as by his skill in war, and formed a\r\nnoble principality in the island, where he was afterwards splendidly\r\ninterred. Cenric moreover, who was as illustrious as his father, after\r\ntwenty-six years, bequeathed the kingdom, somewhat enlarged, to his son\r\nCeawlin.\r\n\r\nThe Chronicles extol the singular valour of this man in battle, so as\r\nto excite a degree of envious admiration; for he was the astonishment\r\nof the Angles, the detestation of the Britons, and was eventually the\r\ndestruction of both. I shall briefly subjoin some extracts from them.\r\nAttacking Ethelbert king of Kent, who was a man in other respects\r\nlaudable, but at that time was endeavouring from the consciousness of\r\nhis family’s dignity to gain the ascendency, and, on this account,\r\nmaking too eager incursions on the territories of his neighbour, he\r\nrouted his troops and forced him to retreat. The Britons, who, in the\r\ntimes of his father and grandfather, had escaped destruction either\r\nby a show of submission, or by the strength of their fortifications\r\nat Gloucester, Cirencester, and Bath, he now pursued with ceaseless\r\nrancour; ejected them from their cities, and chased them into\r\nmountainous and woody districts, as at the present day. But about this\r\ntime, as some unluckly throw of the dice in the table of human life\r\nperpetually disappoints mankind, his military successes were clouded\r\nby domestic calamity: his brother Cutha met an untimely death, and\r\nhe had a son of the same name taken off in battle; both young men of\r\ngreat expectation, whose loss he frequently lamented as a severe blow\r\nto his happiness. Finally, in his latter days, himself, banished from\r\nhis kingdom, presented a spectacle, pitiable even to his enemies. For\r\nhe had sounded, as it were, the trumpet of his own detestation on\r\nall sides, and the Angles as well as the Britons conspiring against\r\nhim, his forces were destroyed at Wodensdike;[34] he lost his kingdom\r\nthirty-one years after he had gained it; went into exile, and shortly\r\nafter died. The floating reins of government were then directed by his\r\nnephews, the sons of Cutha, that is to say, Celric during six, Ceolwulf\r\nduring fourteen years: of these the inferior with respect to age, but\r\nthe more excellent in spirit, passed all his days in war, nor ever\r\nneglected, for a moment, the protection and extension of his empire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 577-626.] CYNEGILS AND CUICHELM.]\r\n\r\nAfter him, the sons of Celric, Cynegils and Cuichelm, jointly put\r\non the ensigns of royalty; both active, both contending with each\r\nother only in mutual offices of kindness; insomuch, that to their\r\ncontemporaries they were a miracle of concord very unusual amongst\r\nprinces, and to posterity a proper example. It is difficult to say\r\nwhether their courage or their moderation exceeded in the numberless\r\ncontests in which they engaged either against the Britons, or against\r\nPenda, king of the Mercians: a man, as will be related in its place,\r\nwonderfully expert in the subtleties of war; and who, overpassing the\r\nlimits of his own territory, in an attempt to add Cirencester to his\r\npossessions, being unable to withstand the power of these united kings,\r\nescaped with only a few followers. A considerable degree of guilt\r\nindeed attaches to Cuichelm, for attempting to take off, by the hands\r\nof an assassin, Edwin king of the Northumbrians, a man of acknowledged\r\nprudence. Yet, if the heathen maxim,\r\n\r\n    Who asks if fraud or force availed the foe?[35]\r\n\r\nbe considered, he will be readily excused, as having done nothing\r\nuncommon, in wishing to get rid, by whatever means, of a rival\r\nencroaching on his power. For he had formerly lopped off much from the\r\nWest Saxon empire, and now receiving fresh ground of offence, and his\r\nancient enmity reviving, he inflicted heavy calamities on that people.\r\nThe kings, however, escaped, and were, not long after, enlightened with\r\nthe heavenly doctrine, by the means of St. Birinus the bishop, in the\r\ntwenty-fifth year of their reign, and the fortieth after the coming of\r\nthe blessed Augustine, the apostle of the Angles. Cynegils, veiling his\r\nprincely pride, condescended to receive immediately the holy rite of\r\nbaptism: Cuichelm resisted for a time, but warned, by the sickness of\r\nhis body, not to endanger the salvation of his soul, he became a sharer\r\nin his brother’s piety, and died the same year. Cynegils departed six\r\nyears afterwards, in the thirty-first year of his reign, enjoying the\r\nhappiness of a long-extended peace.\r\n\r\nKenwalk his son succeeded: in the beginning of his reign, to be\r\ncompared only to the worst of princes; but, in the succeeding and\r\nlatter periods, a rival of the best. The moment the young man became\r\npossessed of power, wantoning in regal luxury and disregarding the\r\nacts of his father, he abjured Christianity and legitimate marriage;\r\nbut being attacked and defeated by Penda, king of Mercia, whose sister\r\nhe had repudiated, he fled to the king of the East Angles. Here, by a\r\nsense of his own calamities and by the perseverance of his host, he was\r\nonce more brought back to the Christian faith; and after three years,\r\nrecovering his strength and resuming his kingdom, he exhibited to his\r\nsubjects the joyful miracle of his reformation. So valiant was he,\r\nthat, he who formerly was unable to defend his own territories, now\r\nextended his dominion on every side; totally defeating in two actions\r\nthe Britons, furious with the recollection of their ancient liberty,\r\nand in consequence perpetually meditating resistance; first, at a place\r\ncalled Witgeornesburg,[36] and then at a mountain named Pene;[37] and\r\nagain, avenging the injury of his father on Wulfhere, the son of Penda,\r\nhe deprived him of the greatest part of his kingdom: moreover he was\r\nso religious, that, first of all his race, he built, for those times,\r\na most beautiful church at Winchester, on which site afterwards was\r\nfounded the episcopal see with still more skilful magnificence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 658.] ACCOUNT OF GLASTONBURY.]\r\n\r\nBut since we have arrived at the times of Kenwalk, and the proper\r\nplace occurs for mentioning the monastery of Glastonbury,[38] I shall\r\ntrace from its very origin the rise and progress of that church as\r\nfar as I am able to discover it from the mass of evidences. It is\r\nrelated in annals of good credit that Lucius, king of the Britons,\r\nsent to Pope Eleutherius, thirteenth in succession from St. Peter, to\r\nentreat, that he would dispel the darkness of Britain by the splendour\r\nof Christian instruction. This surely was the commendable deed of a\r\nmagnanimous prince, eagerly to seek that faith, the mention of which\r\nhad barely reached him, at a time when it was an object of persecution\r\nto almost every king and people to whom it was offered. In consequence,\r\npreachers, sent by Eleutherius, came into Britain, the effects of whose\r\nlabours will remain for ever, although the rust of antiquity may have\r\nobliterated their names. By these was built the ancient church of St.\r\nMary of Glastonbury, as faithful tradition has handed down through\r\ndecaying time. Moreover there are documents of no small credit, which\r\nhave been discovered in certain places to the following effect: “No\r\nother hands than those of the disciples of Christ erected the church\r\nof Glastonbury.” Nor is it dissonant from probability: for if Philip,\r\nthe Apostle, preached to the Gauls, as Freculphus relates in the fourth\r\nchapter of his second book, it may be believed that he also planted\r\nthe word on this side of the channel also. But that I may not seem to\r\nbalk the expectation of my readers by vain imaginations, leaving all\r\ndoubtful matter, I shall proceed to the relation of substantial truths.\r\n\r\nThe church of which we are speaking, from its antiquity called by the\r\nAngles, by way of distinction, “Ealde Chirche,” that is, the “Old\r\nChurch,” of wattle-work, at first, savoured somewhat of heavenly\r\nsanctity even from its very foundation, and exhaled it over the whole\r\ncountry; claiming superior reverence, though the structure was mean.\r\nHence, here arrived whole tribes of the lower orders, thronging every\r\npath; here assembled the opulent divested of their pomp; and it became\r\nthe crowded residence of the religious and the literary. For, as we\r\nhave heard from men of old time, here Gildas, an historian neither\r\nunlearned nor inelegant, to whom the Britons are indebted for whatever\r\nnotice they obtain among other nations, captivated by the sanctity of\r\nthe place, took up his abode for a series of years.[39] This church,\r\nthen, is certainly the oldest I am acquainted with in England, and from\r\nthis circumstance derives its name. In it are preserved the mortal\r\nremains of many saints, some of whom we shall notice in our progress,\r\nnor is any corner of the church destitute of the ashes of the holy. The\r\nvery floor, inlaid with polished stone, and the sides of the altar, and\r\neven the altar itself above and beneath are laden with the multitude of\r\nrelics. Moreover in the pavement may be remarked on every side stones\r\ndesignedly interlaid in triangles and squares, and figured with lead,\r\nunder which if I believe some sacred enigma to be contained, I do no\r\ninjustice to religion. The antiquity, and multitude of its saints, have\r\nendued the place with so much sanctity, that, at night, scarcely any\r\none presumes to keep vigil there, or, during the day, to spit upon its\r\nfloor: he who is conscious of pollution shudders throughout his whole\r\nframe: no one ever brought hawk or horses within the confines of the\r\nneighbouring cemetery, who did not depart injured either in them or in\r\nhimself. Within the memory of man, all persons who, before undergoing\r\nthe ordeal[40] of fire or water, there put up their petitions, exulted\r\nin their escape, one only excepted: if any person erected a building in\r\nits vicinity, which by its shade obstructed the light of the church,\r\nit forthwith became a ruin. And it is sufficiently evident, that, the\r\nmen of that province had no oath more frequent, or more sacred, than\r\nto swear by the Old Church, fearing the swiftest vengeance on their\r\nperjury in this respect. The truth of what I have asserted, if it\r\nbe dubious, will be supported by testimony in the book which I have\r\nwritten, on the antiquity of the said church, according to the series\r\nof years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 676.] PYRAMIDS NEAR GLASTONBURY.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it is clear, that the depository of so many saints\r\nmay be deservedly styled an heavenly sanctuary upon earth. There are\r\nnumbers of documents, though I abstain from mentioning them for fear\r\nof causing weariness, to prove how extremely venerable this place was\r\nheld by the chief persons of the country, who there more especially\r\nchose to await the day of resurrection under the protection of the\r\nmother of God. Willingly would I declare the meaning of those pyramids,\r\nwhich are almost incomprehensible to all, could I but ascertain the\r\ntruth. These, situated some few feet from the church, border on the\r\ncemetery of the monks. That which is the loftiest and nearest the\r\nchurch, is twenty-eight feet high and has five stories: this, though\r\nthreatening ruin from its extreme age, possesses nevertheless some\r\ntraces of antiquity, which may be clearly read though not perfectly\r\nunderstood. In the highest story is an image in a pontifical habit.\r\nIn the next a statue of regal dignity, and the letters, Her Sexi,\r\nand Blisperh. In the third, too, are the names, Pencrest, Bantomp,\r\nPinepegn. In the fourth, Bate, Pulfred, and Eanfled. In the fifth,\r\nwhich is the lowest, there is an image, and the words as follow, Logor,\r\nPeslicas, and Bregden, Spelpes, Highingendes Bearn. The other pyramid\r\nis twenty-six feet high and has four stories, in which are read,\r\nKentwin, Hedda the bishop, and Bregored and Beorward. The meaning of\r\nthese I do not hastily decide, but I shrewdly conjecture that within,\r\nin stone coffins, are contained the bones of those persons whose names\r\nare inscribed without.[41] At least Logor is said to imply the person\r\nfrom whom Logperesbeorh formerly took its name, which is now called\r\nMontacute; Bregden, from whom is derived Brentknolle and Brentmarsh;\r\nBregored and Beorward were abbats of that place in the time of the\r\nBritons; of whom, and of others which occur, I shall henceforward speak\r\nmore circumstantially. For my history will now proceed to disclose\r\nthe succession of abbats, and what was bestowed on each, or on the\r\nmonastery, and by what particular king.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 425-474.] DEATH OF ST. PATRICK.]\r\n\r\nAnd first, I shall briefly mention St. Patrick, from whom the series\r\nof our records dawns. While the Saxons were disturbing the peace of\r\nthe Britons, and the Pelagians assaulting their faith, St. Germanus\r\nof Auxerre assisted them against both; routing the one by the chorus\r\nof Hallelujah,[42] and hurling down the other by the thunder of the\r\nEvangelists and Apostles. Thence returning to his own country, he\r\nsummoned Patrick to become his inmate, and after a few years, sent him,\r\nat the instance of Pope Celestine, to preach to the Irish. Whence it\r\nis written in the Chronicles, “In the year of our Lord’s incarnation\r\n425, St. Patrick is ordained to Ireland by Pope Celestine.” Also,\r\n“In the year 433 Ireland is converted to the faith of Christ by the\r\npreaching of St. Patrick, accompanied by many miracles.” In consequence\r\nexecuting his appointed office with diligence, and in his latter\r\ndays returning to his own country, he landed in Cornwall, from his\r\naltar,[43] which even to this time is held in high veneration by the\r\ninhabitants for its sanctity and efficacy in restoring the infirm.\r\nProceeding to Glastonbury, and there becoming monk, and abbat, after\r\nsome years he paid the debt of nature. All doubt of the truth of this\r\nassertion is removed by the vision of a certain brother, who, after\r\nthe saint’s death, when it had frequently become a question, through\r\ndecay of evidence, whether he really was monk and abbat there, had\r\nthe fact confirmed by the following oracle. When asleep he seemed to\r\nhear some person reading, after many of his miracles, the words which\r\nfollow--“this man then was adorned by the sanctity of the metropolitan\r\npall, but afterwards was here made monk and abbat.” He added, moreover,\r\nas the brother did not give implicit credit to him, that he could show\r\nwhat he had said inscribed in golden letters. Patrick died in the year\r\nof his age 111, of our Lord’s incarnation 472, being the forty-seventh\r\nyear after he was sent into Ireland. He lies on the right side of the\r\naltar in the old church: indeed the care of posterity has enshrined his\r\nbody in silver. Hence the Irish have an ancient usage of frequenting\r\nthe place to kiss the relics of their patron. Wherefore the report\r\nis extremely prevalent that both St. Indract and St. Briget, no mean\r\ninhabitants of Ireland, formerly came over to this spot. Whether\r\nBriget returned home or died at Glastonbury is not sufficiently\r\nascertained, though she left here some of her ornaments; that is to\r\nsay, her necklace, scrip, and implements for embroidering, which are\r\nyet shown in memory of her sanctity, and are efficacious in curing\r\ndivers diseases. In the course of my narrative it will appear that St.\r\nIndract, with seven companions, was martyred near Glastonbury, and\r\nafterwards interred in the old church.[44]\r\n\r\nBenignus succeeded Patrick in the government of the abbey; but for how\r\nlong, remains in doubt. Who he was, and how called in the vernacular\r\ntongue, the verses of his epitaph at Ferramere express, not inaptly:\r\n\r\n  Beneath this marble Beon’s ashes lie,\r\n  Once rev’rend abbat of this monastery:\r\n  Saint Patrick’s servant, as the Irish frame\r\n  The legend-tale, and Beon was his name.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful works both of his former life, and since his recent\r\ntranslation into the greater church, proclaim the singular grace of\r\nGod which he anciently possessed, and which he still retains.\r\n\r\nThe esteem in which David, archbishop of Menevia, held this place, is\r\ntoo notorious to require repeating. He established the antiquity and\r\nsanctity of the church by a divine oracle; for purposing to dedicate\r\nit, he came to the spot with his seven suffragan bishops, and every\r\nthing being prepared for the due celebration of the solemnity, on the\r\nnight, as he purposed, preceding it, he gave way to profound repose.\r\nWhen all his senses were steeped in rest, he beheld the Lord Jesus\r\nstanding near, and mildly inquiring the cause of his arrival; and on\r\nhis immediately disclosing it, the Lord diverted him from his purpose\r\nby saying, “That the church had been already dedicated by himself in\r\nhonour of his Mother, and that the ceremony was not to be profaned\r\nby human repetition.” With these words he seemed to bore the palm of\r\nhis hand with his finger, adding, “That this was a sign for him not\r\nto reiterate what himself had done before. But that, since his design\r\nsavoured more of piety than of temerity, his punishment should not be\r\nprolonged: and lastly, that on the following morning, when he should\r\nrepeat the words of the mass, ‘With him, and by him, and in him,’\r\nhis health should return to him undiminished.” The prelate, awakened\r\nby these terrific appearances, as at the moment he grew pale at the\r\npurulent matter, so afterwards he hailed the truth of the prediction.\r\nBut that he might not appear to have done nothing, he quickly built\r\nand dedicated another church. Of this celebrated and incomparable man,\r\nI am at a loss to decide, whether he closed his life in this place,\r\nor at his own cathedral. For they affirm that he is with St. Patrick;\r\nand the Welsh, both by the frequency of their prayers to him and by\r\nvarious reports, without doubt confirm and establish this opinion;\r\nopenly alleging that bishop Bernard sought after him more than once,\r\nnotwithstanding much opposition, but was not able to find him. But let\r\nthus much suffice of St. David.\r\n\r\nAfter a long lapse of time, St. Augustine, at the instance of St.\r\nGregory, came into Britain in the year of our Lord’s incarnation 596,\r\nand the tradition of our ancestors has handed down, that the companion\r\nof his labours, Paulinus, who was bishop of Rochester after being\r\narchbishop of York, covered the church, built, as we have before\r\nobserved, of wattle-work, with a casing of boards. The dexterity of\r\nthis celebrated man so artfully managed, that nothing of its sanctity\r\nshould be lost, though much should accrue to its beauty: and certainly\r\nthe more magnificent the ornaments of churches are, the more they\r\nincline the brute mind to prayer, and bend the stubborn to supplication.\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord’s incarnation 601, that is, the fifth after\r\nthe arrival of St. Augustine, the king of Devonshire, on the petition\r\nof abbat Worgrez, granted to the old church which is there situated\r\nthe land called Ineswitrin, containing five cassates.[45] “I, Maworn,\r\nbishop, wrote this grant. I, Worgrez, abbat of the same place, signed\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 596-692.] GRANTS TO GLASTONBURY.]\r\n\r\nWho this king might be, the antiquity of the instrument prevents\r\nour knowing. But that he was a Briton cannot be doubted, because he\r\ncalled Glastonbury, Ineswitrin, in his vernacular tongue; and that,\r\nin the British, it is so called, is well known. Moreover it is proper\r\nto remark the extreme antiquity of a church, which, even then, was\r\ncalled “the old church.” In addition to Worgrez, Lademund and Bregored,\r\nwhose very names imply British barbarism, were abbats of this place.\r\nThe periods of their presiding are uncertain, but their names and\r\ndignities are indicated by a painting in the larger church, near the\r\naltar. Blessed, therefore, are the inhabitants of this place, allured\r\nto uprightness of life, by reverence for such a sanctuary. I cannot\r\nsuppose that any of these, when dead, can fail of heaven, when assisted\r\nby the virtues and intercession of so many patrons. In the year of our\r\nLord’s incarnation 670, and the 29th of his reign, Kenwalk gave to\r\nBerthwald, abbat of Glastonbury, Ferramere, two hides, at the request\r\nof archbishop Theodore. The same Berthwald, against the will of the\r\nking and of the bishop of the diocese, relinquishing Glastonbury, went\r\nto govern the monastery of Reculver. In consequence, Berthwald equally\r\nrenowned for piety and high birth, being nephew to Ethelred, king of\r\nthe Mercians, and residing in the vicinity of Canterbury, on the demise\r\nof archbishop Theodore, succeeded to his see. This may be sufficient\r\nfor me to have inserted on the antiquity of the church of Glastonbury.\r\nNow I shall return in course to Kenwalk, who was of a character so\r\nmunificent that he never refused to give any part of his patrimony to\r\nhis relations; but with noble-minded generosity conferred nearly the\r\nthird of his kingdom on his nephew.[46] These qualities of the royal\r\nmind, were stimulated by the admonitions of those holy bishops of his\r\nprovince, Agilbert, of whom Bede relates many commendable things in\r\nhis history of the Angles, and his nephew Leutherius, who, after him,\r\nwas, for seven years, bishop of the West Saxons. This circumstance I\r\nhave thought proper to mention, because Bede has left no account of the\r\nduration of his episcopacy, and to disguise a fact which I learn from\r\nthe Chronicles, would be against my conscience; besides, it affords\r\nan opportunity for making mention of a distinguished man, who by a\r\nmind, clear, and almost divinely inspired, advanced the monastery of\r\nMalmesbury, where I carry on my earthly warfare, to the highest pitch.\r\nThis monastery was so slenderly endowed by Maildulph, a Scot, as they\r\nsay, by nation, a philosopher by erudition, and a monk by profession,\r\nthat its members could scarcely procure their daily subsistence; but\r\nLeutherius, after long and due deliberation, gave it to Aldhelm,[47] a\r\nmonk of the same place, to be by him governed with the authority then\r\npossessed by bishops. Of which matter, that my relation may obviate\r\nevery doubt, I shall subjoin his own words.\r\n\r\n“I, Leutherius, by divine permission, bishop supreme of the Saxon see,\r\nam requested by the abbats who, within the jurisdiction of our diocese,\r\npreside over the conventual assemblies of monks with pastoral anxiety,\r\nto give and to grant that portion of land called Maildulfesburgh, to\r\nAldhelm the priest, for the purpose of leading a life according to\r\nstrict rule; in which place, indeed, from his earliest infancy and\r\nfirst initiation in the study of learning, he has been instructed\r\nin the liberal arts, and passed his days, nurtured in the bosom of\r\nthe holy mother church; and on which account fraternal love appears\r\nprincipally to have conceived this request. Wherefore assenting to the\r\npetition of the aforesaid abbats, I willingly grant that place to him\r\nand his successors, who shall sedulously follow the laws of the holy\r\ninstitution. Done publicly near the river Bladon;[48] this eighth\r\nbefore the kalends of September, in the year of our Lord’s incarnation\r\n672.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 670.] PIETY OF ALDHELM.]\r\n\r\nBut when the industry of the abbat was superadded to the kindness\r\nof the bishop, then the affairs of the monastery began to flourish\r\nexceedingly; then monks assembled on all sides; there was a general\r\nconcourse to Aldhelm; some admiring the sanctity of his life, others\r\nthe depth of his learning. For he was a man as unsophisticated in\r\nreligion as multifarious in knowledge; whose piety surpassed even his\r\nreputation; and he had so fully imbibed the liberal arts, that he was\r\nwonderful in each of them, and unrivalled in all. I greatly err, if\r\nhis works written on the subject of virginity,[49] than which, in my\r\nopinion, nothing can be more pleasing or more splendid, are not proofs\r\nof his immortal genius: although, such is the slothfulness of our\r\ntimes, they may excite disgust in some persons, not duly considering\r\nhow modes of expression differ according to the customs of nations. The\r\nGreeks, for instance, express themselves impliedly, the Romans clearly,\r\nthe Gauls gorgeously, the Angles turgidly. And truly, as it is pleasant\r\nto dwell on the graces of our ancestors and to animate our minds by\r\ntheir example, I would here, most willingly, unfold what painful\r\nlabours this holy man encountered for the privileges of our church,\r\nand with what miracles he signalized his life, did not my avocations\r\nlead me elsewhere; and his noble acts appear clearer even to the eye\r\nof the purblind, than they can possibly be sketched by my pencil. The\r\ninnumerable miracles which now take place at his tomb, manifest to the\r\npresent race the sanctity of the life he passed. He has therefore his\r\nproper praise; he has the fame acquired by his merits.[50] We proceed\r\nwith the history.\r\n\r\nAfter thirty-one years, Kenwalk dying, bequeathed the administration of\r\nthe government to his wife Sexburga; nor did this woman want spirit for\r\ndischarging the duties of the station. She levied new forces, preserved\r\nthe old in their duty; ruled her subjects with moderation, and overawed\r\nher enemies: in short, she conducted all things in such a manner, that\r\nno difference was discernible except that of her sex. But, breathing\r\nmore than female spirit, she died, having scarcely reigned a year.\r\n\r\nEscwin passed the next two years in the government; a near relation\r\nto the royal family, being grand-nephew to Cynegils, by his brother\r\nCuthgist. At his death, either natural or violent, for I cannot exactly\r\nfind which, Kentwin, the son of Cynegils, filled the vacant throne\r\nin legitimate succession. Both were men of noted experience in war;\r\nas the one routed the Mercians, the other the Britons, with dreadful\r\nslaughter: but they were to be pitied for the shortness of their\r\ncareer; the reign of the latter not extending beyond nine, that of the\r\nformer, more than two years, as I have already related. This is on the\r\ncredit of the Chronicles. However, Bede records that they did not reign\r\nsuccessively, but divided the kingdom between them.\r\n\r\nNext sprang forth a noble branch of the royal stock, Cædwalla,\r\ngrand-nephew of Ceawlin, by his brother Cutha: a youth of unbounded\r\npromise, who allowed no opportunity of exercising his valour to escape\r\nhim. He, having long since, by his active exertions, excited the\r\nanimosity of the princes of his country, was, by a conspiracy, driven\r\ninto exile. Yielding to this outrage, as the means of depriving the\r\nprovince of its warlike force, he led away all the military population\r\nwith him; for, whether out of pity to his broken fortunes, or regard\r\nfor his valour, the whole of the youth accompanied him into exile.\r\nEthelwalch, king of the South Saxons, hazarding an engagement with him,\r\nfelt the first effects of his fury: for he was routed with all the\r\nforces he had collected, and too late repented his rash design.[51] The\r\nspirits of his followers being thus elated, Cædwalla, by a sudden and\r\nunexpected return, drove the rivals of his power from the kingdom.\r\nEnjoying his government for the space of two years, he performed many\r\nsignal exploits. His hatred and hostility towards the South Saxons\r\nwere inextinguishable, and he totally destroyed Edric, the successor\r\nof Ethelwalch, who opposed him with renovated boldness: he nearly\r\ndepopulated the Isle of Wight, which had rebelled in confederacy with\r\nthe Mercians: he also gained repeated victories over the people of\r\nKent, as I have mentioned before in their history. Finally, as is\r\nobserved above, he retired from that province, on the death of his\r\nbrother, compensating his loss by the blood of many of its inhabitants.\r\nIt is difficult to relate, how extremely pious he was even before\r\nhis baptism, insomuch that he dedicated to God the tenth of all the\r\nspoils which he had acquired in war. In which, though we approve the\r\nintention, we condemn the example; according to the saying: “He who\r\noffers sacrifice from the substance of a poor man, is like him who\r\nimmolates the son in the sight of the father.” That he went to Rome to\r\nbe baptized by Pope Sergius, and was called Peter; and that he yielded\r\njoyfully to the will of heaven, while yet in his initiatory robes, are\r\nmatters too well known to require our illustration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 686-694.] INA.]\r\n\r\nAfter his departure to Rome, the government was assumed by Ina,\r\ngrand-nephew of Cynegils by his brother Cuthbald, who ascended\r\nthe throne, more from the innate activity of his spirit, than any\r\nlegitimate right of succession. He was a rare example of fortitude; a\r\nmirror of prudence; unequalled in piety. Thus regulating his life, he\r\ngained favour at home and respect abroad. Safe from any apprehensions\r\nof treachery, he grew old in the discharge of his duties for\r\nfifty-eight years, the pious conciliator of general esteem. His first\r\nexpedition was against the people of Kent, as the indignation at their\r\nburning Moll had not yet subsided. The inhabitants resisted awhile:\r\nbut soon finding all their attempts and endeavours fail, and seeing\r\nnothing in the disposition of Ina which could lead them to suppose he\r\nwould remit his exertions, they were induced, by the contemplation of\r\ntheir losses, to treat of a surrender. They tempt the royal mind with\r\npresents, lure him with promises, and bargain for a peace for thirty\r\nthousand marks of gold, that, softened by so high a price, he should\r\nput an end to the war, and, bound in golden chains, sound a retreat.\r\nAccepting the money, as a sufficient atonement for their offence, he\r\nreturned into his kingdom. And not only the people of Kent, but the\r\nEast Angles[52] also felt the effects of his hereditary anger; all\r\ntheir nobility being first expelled, and afterwards routed in battle.\r\nBut let the relation of his military successes here find a termination.\r\nMoreover how sedulous he was in religious matters, the laws he enacted\r\nto reform the manners of the people, are proof sufficient;[53] in which\r\nthe image of his purity is reflected even upon the present times.\r\nAnother proof are the monasteries nobly founded at the king’s expense.\r\nBut[54] more especially Glastonbury, whither he ordered the bodies of\r\nthe blessed martyr, Indract, and of his associates, to be taken from\r\nthe place of their martyrdom and to be conveyed into the church. The\r\nbody of St. Indract he deposited in the stone pyramid on the left\r\nside of the altar, where the zeal of posterity afterwards also placed\r\nSt. Hilda: the others were distributed beneath the pavement as chance\r\ndirected or regard might suggest. Here, too, he erected a church,\r\ndedicated to the holy apostles, as an appendage to the ancient church,\r\nof which we are speaking, enriched it with vast possessions, and\r\ngranted it a privilege to the following effect:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 725.] INA’S GRANTS.]\r\n\r\n“In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ: I, Ina, supported in my\r\nroyal dignity by God, with the advice of my queen, Sexburga, and\r\nthe permission of Berthwald, archbishop of Canterbury, and of all\r\nhis suffragans; and also at the instance of the princes Baltred\r\nand Athelard, to the ancient church, situate in the place called\r\nGlastonbury (which church the great high-priest and chiefest minister\r\nformerly through his own ministry, and that of angels, sanctified by\r\nmany and unheard-of miracles to himself and the eternal Virgin Mary,\r\nas was formerly revealed to St. David,) do grant out of those places,\r\nwhich I possess by paternal inheritance, and hold in my demesne, they\r\nbeing adjacent and fitting for the purpose, for the maintenance of the\r\nmonastic institution, and the use of the monks, Brente ten hides, Sowy\r\nten hides, Pilton twenty hides, Dulting twenty hides, Bledenhida one\r\nhide, together with whatever my predecessors have contributed to the\r\nsame church:[55] to wit, Kenwalk, who, at the instance of archbishop\r\nTheodore, gave Ferramere, Bregarai, Coneneie, Martineseie, Etheredseie;\r\nKentwin, who used to call Glastonbury, “the mother of saints,” and\r\nliberated it from every secular and ecclesiastical service, and granted\r\nit this dignified privilege, that the brethren of that place should\r\nhave the power of electing and appointing their ruler according to the\r\nrule of St. Benedict: Hedda the bishop, with permission of Cædwalla,\r\nwho, though a heathen, confirmed it with his own hand, gave Lantokay:\r\nBaltred, who gave Pennard, six hides: Athelard who contributed Poelt,\r\nsixty hides; I, Ina, permitting and confirming it. To the piety and\r\naffectionate entreaty of these people I assent, and I guard by the\r\nsecurity of my royal grant against the designs of malignant men and\r\nsnarling curs, in order that the church of our Lord Jesus Christ and\r\nthe eternal Virgin Mary, as it is the first in the kingdom of Britain\r\nand the source and the fountain of all religion, may obtain surpassing\r\ndignity and privilege, and, as she rules over choirs of angels in\r\nheaven, it may never pay servile obedience to men on earth. Wherefore\r\nthe chief pontiff, Gregory, assenting, and taking the mother of his\r\nLord, and me, however unworthy, together with her, into the bosom and\r\nprotection of the holy Roman church; and all the princes, archbishops,\r\nbishops, dukes, and abbats of Britain consenting, I appoint and\r\nestablish, that, all lands, places, and possessions of St. Mary of\r\nGlastonbury be free, quiet, and undisturbed, from all royal taxes and\r\nworks, which are wont to be appointed, that is to say, expeditions, the\r\nbuilding of bridges or forts, and from the edicts or molestations of\r\nall archbishops or bishops, as is found to be confirmed and granted by\r\nmy predecessors, Kenwalk, Kentwin, Cædwalla, Baltred, in the ancient\r\ncharters of the same church. And whatsoever questions shall arise,\r\nwhether of homicide, sacrilege, poison, theft, rapine, the disposal\r\nand limits of churches, the ordination of clerks, ecclesiastical\r\nsynods, and all judicial inquiries, they shall be determined by the\r\ndecision of the abbat and convent, without the interference of any\r\nperson whatsoever. Moreover, I command all princes, archbishops,\r\nbishops, dukes, and governors of my kingdom, as they tender my honour\r\nand regard, and all dependants, mine as well as theirs, as they value\r\ntheir personal safety, never to dare enter the island of our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist and of the eternal Virgin, at Glastonbury, nor the possessions\r\nof the said church, for the purpose of holding courts, making inquiry,\r\nor seizing, or doing anything whatever to the offence of the servants\r\nof God there residing: moreover I particularly inhibit, by the curse\r\nof Almighty God, of the eternal Virgin Mary, and of the holy apostles\r\nPeter and Paul, and of the rest of the saints, any bishop on any\r\naccount whatever from presuming to take his episcopal seat or celebrate\r\ndivine service or consecrate altars, or dedicate churches, or ordain,\r\nor do any thing whatever, either in the church of Glastonbury itself,\r\nor its dependent churches, that is to say--Sowy, Brente, Merlinch,\r\nSapewic, Stret, Sbudeclalech, Pilton, or in their chapels, or islands,\r\nunless he be specially invited by the abbat or brethren of that place.\r\nBut if he come upon such invitation, he shall take nothing to himself\r\nof the things of the church, nor of the offerings; knowing that he has\r\ntwo mansions appointed him in two several places out of this church’s\r\npossessions, one in Pilton, the other in the village called Poelt,\r\nthat, when coming or going, he may have a place of entertainment.\r\nNor even shall it be lawful for him to pass the night here unless\r\nhe shall be detained by stress of weather or bodily sickness, or\r\ninvited by the abbat or monks, and then with not more than three or\r\nfour clerks. Moreover let the aforesaid bishop be mindful every year,\r\nwith his clerks that are at Wells, to acknowledge his mother church\r\nof Glastonbury with litanies on the second day after our Lord’s\r\nascension; and should he haughtily defer it, or fail in the things\r\nwhich are above recited and confirmed, he shall forfeit his mansions\r\nabove-mentioned. The abbat or monks shall direct whom they please,\r\ncelebrating Easter canonically, to perform service in the church of\r\nGlastonbury, its dependent churches, and in their chapels. Whosoever,\r\nbe he of what dignity, profession, or degree, he may, shall hereafter,\r\non any occasion whatsoever, attempt to pervert, or nullify this, the\r\nwitness of my munificence and liberality, let him be aware that, with\r\nthe traitor Judas, he shall perish, to his eternal confusion, in the\r\ndevouring flames of unspeakable torments. The charter of this donation\r\nwas written in the year of our Lord’s incarnation 725, the fourteenth\r\nof the indiction, in the presence of the king Ina, and of Berthwald,\r\narchbishop of Canterbury.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 709.] ENDOWMENT OF GLASTONBURY.]\r\n\r\nWhat splendour he [Ina] added to the monastery, may be collected from\r\nthe short treatise which I have written about its antiquities.[56]\r\nFather Aldhelm assisted the design, and his precepts were heard with\r\nhumility, nobly adopted, and joyfully carried into effect. Lastly,\r\nthe king readily confirmed the privilege which Aldhelm had obtained\r\nfrom pope Sergius, for the immunity of his monasteries; gave much to\r\nthe servants of God by his advice, and finally honoured him, though\r\nconstantly refusing, with a bishopric; but an early death malignantly\r\ncut off this great man from the world. For scarcely had he discharged\r\nthe offices of his bishopric four years, ere he made his soul an\r\noffering to heaven, in the year of our Lord’s incarnation 709, on the\r\nvigil of St. Augustine the apostle of the Angles, namely the eighth\r\nbefore the Kalends of June.[57] Some say, that he was the nephew of\r\nthe king, by his brother Kenten; but I do not choose to assert for\r\ntruth any thing which savours more of vague opinion, than of historic\r\ncredibility; especially as I can find no ancient record of it, and the\r\nChronicle clearly declares, that Ina had no other brother than Ingild,\r\nwho died some few years before him. Aldhelm needs no support from\r\nfiction: such great things are there concerning him of indisputable\r\ntruth, so many which are beyond the reach of doubt. The sisters,\r\nindeed, of Ina were Cuthburga and Cwenburga. Cuthburga was given\r\nin marriage to Alfrid, king of the Northumbrians, but the contract\r\nbeing soon after dissolved, she led a life dedicated to God, first at\r\nBarking,[58] under the abbess Hildelitha, and afterwards as superior of\r\nthe convent at Wimborne; now a mean village, but formerly celebrated\r\nfor containing a full company of virgins, dead to earthly desires, and\r\nbreathing only aspirations towards heaven. She embraced the profession\r\nof holy celibacy from the perusal of Aldhelm’s books on virginity,\r\ndedicated indeed to the sisterhood of Barking, but profitable to all,\r\nwho aspire to that state. Ina’s queen was Ethelburga, a woman of royal\r\nrace and disposition: who perpetually urging the necessity of bidding\r\nadieu to earthly things, at least in the close of life, and the king as\r\nconstantly deferring the execution of her advice, at last endeavoured\r\nto overcome him by stratagem. For, on a certain occasion, when they had\r\nbeen revelling at a country seat with more than usual riot and luxury,\r\nthe next day, after their departure, an attendant, with the privity\r\nof the queen, defiled the palace in every possible manner, both with\r\nthe excrement of cattle and heaps of filth; and lastly he put a sow,\r\nwhich had recently farrowed, in the very bed where they had lain. They\r\nhad hardly proceeded a mile, ere she attacked her husband with the\r\nfondest conjugal endearments, entreating that they might immediately\r\nreturn thither, whence they had departed, saying, that his denial would\r\nbe attended with dangerous consequences. Her petition being readily\r\ngranted, the king was astonished at seeing a place, which yesterday\r\nmight have vied with Assyrian luxury, now filthily disgusting and\r\ndesolate: and silently pondering on the sight, his eyes at length\r\nturned upon the queen. Seizing the opportunity, and pleasantly smiling,\r\nshe said, “My noble spouse, where are the revellings of yesterday?\r\nWhere the tapestries dipped in Sidonian dyes? Where the ceaseless\r\nimpertinence of parasites? Where the sculptured vessels, overwhelming\r\nthe very tables with their weight of gold? Where are the delicacies so\r\nanxiously sought throughout sea and land, to pamper the appetite? Are\r\nnot all these things smoke and vapour? Have they not all passed away?\r\nWoe be to those who attach themselves to such, for they in like manner\r\nshall consume away. Are not all these like a rapid river hastening to\r\nthe sea? And woe to those who are attached to them, for they shall be\r\ncarried away by the current. Reflect, I entreat you, how wretchedly\r\nwill these bodies decay, which we pamper with such unbounded luxury.\r\nMust not we, who gorge so constantly, become more disgustingly putrid?\r\nThe mighty must undergo mightier torments, and a severer trial awaits\r\nthe strong.” Without saying more, by this striking example, she gained\r\nover her husband to those sentiments, which she had in vain attempted\r\nfor years by persuasion.[59]\r\n\r\nFor after his triumphal spoils in war; after many successive degrees in\r\nvirtue, he aspired to the highest perfection, and went to Rome. There,\r\nnot to make the glory of his conversion public, but that he might be\r\nacceptable in the sight of God alone, he was shorn in secret; and, clad\r\nin homely garb, grew old in privacy. Nor did his queen, the author\r\nof this noble deed, desert him; but as she had before incited him to\r\nundertake it, so, afterwards, she made it her constant care to soothe\r\nhis sorrows by her conversation, to stimulate him, when wavering, by\r\nher example; in short, to omit nothing that could be conducive to his\r\nsalvation. Thus united in mutual affection, in due time they trod the\r\ncommon path of all mankind. This was attended, as we have heard, with\r\nsingular miracles, such as God often deigns to bestow on the virtues of\r\nhappy couples.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 725-741.] ETHELARD--CUTHRED.]\r\n\r\nTo the government succeeded Ethelard, the cousin of Ina; though Oswald,\r\na youth of royal extraction, often obscured his opening prospects.\r\nExciting his countrymen to rebellion, he attempted to make war on the\r\nking, but soon after perishing by some unhappy doom, Ethelard kept\r\nquiet possession of the kingdom for fourteen years, and then left it to\r\nhis kinsman, Cuthred, who for an equal space of time, and with similar\r\ncourage, was ever actively employed:--\r\n\r\n“In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I, Cuthred, king of the West\r\nSaxons, do hereby declare that all the gifts of former kings--Kentwin,\r\nBaldred, Kedwall, Ina, Ethelard, and Ethelbald king of the Mercians,\r\nin country houses, and in villages and lands, and farms, and mansions,\r\naccording to the confirmations made to the ancient city of Glastonbury,\r\nand confirmed by autograph and by the sign of the cross, I do, as was\r\nbefore said, hereby decree that this grant of former kings shall remain\r\nfirm and inviolate, as long as the revolution of the pole shall carry\r\nthe lands and seas with regular movement round the starry heavens.\r\nBut if any one, confiding in tyrannical pride shall endeavour on any\r\noccasion to disturb and nullify this my testamentary grant, may he be\r\nseparated by the fan of the last judgment from the congregation of the\r\nrighteous, and joined to the assembly of the wicked for ever, paying\r\nthe penalty of his violence. But whoever with benevolent intention\r\nshall strive to approve, confirm, and defend this my grant, may he be\r\nallowed to enjoy unfailing immortality before the glory of Him that\r\nsitteth on the throne, together with the happy companies of angels and\r\nof all the saints. A copy of this grant was set forth in presence of\r\nking Cuthred, in the aforesaid monastery, and dedicated to the holy\r\naltar by the munificence of his own hand, in the wooden church, where\r\nthe brethren placed the coffin of abbat Hemgils, the 30th of April, in\r\nthe year of our Lord 745.”\r\n\r\nThe same Cuthred, after much toil, made a successful campaign against\r\nEthelbald, king of Mercia, and the Britons, and gave up the sovereignty\r\nafter he had held it fourteen years.\r\n\r\nSigebert then seized on the kingdom; a man of inhuman cruelty among\r\nhis own subjects, and noted for cowardice abroad; but the common\r\ndetestation of all conspiring against him, he was within a year driven\r\nfrom the throne, and gave place to one more worthy. Yet, as commonly\r\nhappens in similar cases, the severity of his misfortunes brought back\r\nsome persons to his cause, and the province which is called Hampshire,\r\nwas, by their exertions, retained in subjection to him. Still, however,\r\nunable to quit his former habits, and exciting the enmity of all\r\nagainst him by the murder of one Cumbran, who had adhered to him with\r\nunshaken fidelity, he fled to the recesses of wild beasts. Misfortune\r\nstill attending him thither also, he was stabbed by a swineherd. Thus\r\nthe cruelty of a king, which had almost desolated the higher ranks, was\r\nput an end to by a man of the lowest condition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 776-784.] DEATH OF CYNEWOLF.]\r\n\r\nCynewolf next undertook the guidance of the state; illustrious for\r\nthe regulation of his conduct and his deeds in arms: but suffering\r\nextremely from the loss of a single battle, in the twenty-fourth year\r\nof his reign, against Offa, king of the Mercians, near Bensington,\r\nhe was also finally doomed to a disgraceful death. For after he had\r\nreigned thirty-one years,[60] neither indolently nor oppressively,\r\neither elated with success, because he imagined nothing could oppose\r\nhim, or alarmed for his posterity, from the increasing power of\r\nKineard, the brother of Sigebert, he compelled him to quit the kingdom.\r\nKineard, deeming it necessary to yield to the emergency of the times,\r\ndeparted as if voluntarily; but soon after, when by secret meetings\r\nhe had assembled a desperate band of wretches, watching when the king\r\nmight be alone, for he had gone into the country for the sake of\r\nrecreation, he followed him thither with his party. And learning that\r\nhe was there giving loose to improper desires, he beset the house on\r\nall sides. The king struck with his perilous situation, and holding a\r\nconference with the persons present, shut fast the doors, expecting\r\neither to appease the desperadoes by fair language, or to terrify them\r\nby threats. When neither succeeded, he rushed furiously on Kineard, and\r\nhad nearly killed him; but, surrounded by the multitude, and thinking\r\nit derogatory to his courage to give way, he fell, selling his life\r\nnobly. Some few of his attendants, who, instead of yielding, attempted\r\nto take vengeance for the loss of their lord, were slain. The report\r\nof this dreadful outrage soon reached the ears of the nobles, who were\r\nwaiting near at hand. Of these Esric, the chief in age and prudence,\r\nconjuring the rest not to leave unrevenged the death of their sovereign\r\nto their own signal and eternal ignominy, rushed with drawn sword upon\r\nthe conspirators. At first Kineard attempted to argue his case; to\r\nmake tempting offers; to hold forth their relationship; but when this\r\navailed nothing, he stimulated his party to resistance. Doubtful was\r\nthe conflict, where one side contended with all its powers for life,\r\nthe other for glory. And victory, wavering for a long time, at last\r\ndecided for the juster cause. Thus, fruitlessly valiant, this unhappy\r\nman lost his life, unable long to boast the success of his treachery.\r\nThe king’s body was buried at Winchester, and the prince’s at Repton;\r\nat that time a noble monastery, but at present, as I have heard, with\r\nfew, or scarcely any inmates.\r\n\r\nAfter him, for sixteen years, reigned Bertric: more studious of\r\npeace than of war. Skilful in conciliating friendship, affable with\r\nforeigners, and giving great allowances to his subjects, in those\r\nmatters at least which could not impair the strength of the government.\r\nTo acquire still greater estimation with his neighbours, he married\r\nthe daughter of Offa, king of Mercia, at that time all-powerful; by\r\nwhom, as far as I am acquainted, he had no issue. Supported by this\r\nalliance he compelled Egbert, the sole survivor of the royal stock,\r\nand whom he feared as the most effectual obstacle to his power, to\r\nfly into France. In fact Bertric himself, and the other kings, after\r\nIna, though glorying in the splendour of their parentage, as deriving\r\ntheir origin from Cerdic, had considerably deviated from the direct\r\nline of the royal race. On Egbert’s expulsion, then, he had already\r\nbegun to indulge in indolent security, when a piratical tribe of the\r\nDanes, accustomed to live by plunder, clandestinely arriving in three\r\nships, disturbed the tranquillity of the kingdom. This band came over\r\nexpressly to ascertain the fruitfulness of the soil, and the courage\r\nof the inhabitants, as was afterwards discovered by the arrival of\r\nthat multitude, which over-ran almost the whole of Britain. Landing\r\nthen, unexpectedly, when the kingdom was in a state of profound peace,\r\nthey seized upon a royal village, which was nearest them, and killed\r\nthe superintendent, who had advanced with succours; but losing their\r\nbooty, through fear of the people, who hastened to attack them, they\r\nretired to their ships. After Bertric, who was buried at Warham, Egbert\r\nascended the throne of his ancestors; justly to be preferred to all the\r\nkings who preceded him. Thus having brought down our narrative to his\r\ntimes, we must, as we have promised, next give our attention to the\r\nNorthumbrians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n_Of the kings of the Northumbrians._ [A.D. 450.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have before related briefly, and now necessarily repeat, that\r\nHengist, having settled his own government in Kent, had sent his\r\nbrother Otha, and his son Ebusa, men of activity and tried experience,\r\nto seize on the northern parts of Britain. Sedulous in executing the\r\ncommand, affairs succeeded to their wishes. For frequently coming\r\ninto action with the inhabitants, and dispersing those who attempted\r\nresistance, they conciliated with uninterrupted quiet such as\r\nsubmitted. Thus, though through their own address and the good will of\r\ntheir followers, they had established a certain degree of power, yet\r\nnever entertaining an idea of assuming the royal title, they left an\r\nexample of similar moderation to their immediate posterity. For during\r\nthe space of ninety-nine years, the Northumbrian leaders, contented\r\nwith subordinate power, lived in subjection to the kings of Kent.\r\nAfterwards, however, this forbearance ceased; either because the human\r\nmind is ever prone to degeneracy, or because that race of people was\r\nnaturally ambitious. In the year, therefore, of our Lord’s incarnation\r\n547, the sixtieth after Hengist’s death, the principality was converted\r\ninto a kingdom. The most noble Ida, in the full vigour of life and of\r\nstrength, first reigned there. But whether he himself seized the chief\r\nauthority, or received it by the consent of others, I by no means\r\nventure to determine, because the truth is unrevealed. However, it is\r\nsufficiently evident, that, sprung from a great and ancient lineage,\r\nhe reflected much splendour on his illustrious descent, by his pure\r\nand unsullied manners. Unconquerable abroad, at home he tempered his\r\nkingly power with peculiar affability. Of this man, and of others, in\r\ntheir respective places, I could lineally trace the descent, were it\r\nnot that the very names, of uncouth sound, would be less agreeable to\r\nmy readers than I wish. It may be proper though to remark, that Woden\r\nhad three sons; Weldeg, Withleg, and Beldeg; from the first, the kings\r\nof Kent derived their origin; from the second, the kings of Mercia; and\r\nfrom the third, the kings of the West-Saxons and Northumbrians, with\r\nthe exception of the two I am going to particularize. This Ida, then,\r\nthe ninth from Beldeg, and the tenth from Woden, as I find positively\r\ndeclared, continued in the government fourteen years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 450-560.] IDA--ALLA.]\r\n\r\nHis successor Alla, originating from the same stock, but descending\r\nfrom Woden by a different branch, conducted the government, extended\r\nby his exertions considerably beyond its former bounds, for thirty\r\nyears. In his time, youths from Northumbria were exposed for sale,\r\nafter the common and almost native custom of this people; so that,\r\neven as our days have witnessed, they would make no scruple of\r\nseparating the nearest ties of relationship through the temptation\r\nof the slightest advantage. Some of these youths then, carried from\r\nEngland for sale to Rome, became the means of salvation to all their\r\ncountrymen. For exciting the attention of that city, by the beauty of\r\ntheir countenances and the elegance of their features, it happened\r\nthat, among others, the blessed Gregory, at that time archdeacon of\r\nthe apostolical see, was present. Admiring such an assemblage of grace\r\nin mortals, and, at the same time, pitying their abject condition, as\r\ncaptives, he asked the standers-by, “of what race are these? Whence\r\ncome they?” They reply, “by birth they are Angles; by country are\r\nDeiri; (Deira being a province of Northumbria,) subjects of King Alla,\r\nand Pagans.” Their concluding characteristic he accompanied with\r\nheartfelt sighs: to the others he elegantly alluded, saying, “that\r\nthese Angles, _angel_-like, should be delivered from (_de_) _ira_,\r\nand taught to sing _Alle-luia_.” Obtaining permission without delay\r\nfrom pope Benedict, the industry of this excellent man was all alive\r\nto enter on the journey to convert them; and certainly his zeal would\r\nhave completed this intended labour, had not the mutinous love of his\r\nfellow citizens recalled him, already on his progress. He was a man\r\nas celebrated for his virtues, as beloved by his countrymen; for by\r\nhis matchless worth, he had even exceeded the expectations they had\r\nformed of him from his youth. His good intention, though frustrated at\r\nthis time, received afterwards, during his pontificate, an honourable\r\ntermination, as the reader will find in its proper place. I have\r\nmade this insertion with pleasure, that my readers might not lose\r\nthis notice of Alla, mention of whom is slightly made in the life of\r\nPope Gregory, who, although he was the primary cause of introducing\r\nChristianity among the Angles, yet, either by the counsel of God, or\r\nsome mischance, was never himself permitted to know it. The calling,\r\nindeed, descended to his son.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Alla, Ethelric, the son of Ida, advanced to extreme old\r\nage, after a life consumed in penury, obtained the kingdom, and after\r\nfive years, was taken off by a sudden death. He was a pitiable prince,\r\nwhom fame would have hidden in obscurity, had not the conspicuous\r\nenergy of the son lifted up the father to notice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 588-603.] ETHELFRID.]\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, by a long old age, he had satisfied the desire of\r\nlife, Ethelfrid, the elder of his sons, ascended the throne, and\r\ncompensated the greenness of his years by the maturity of his conduct.\r\nHis transactions have been so displayed by graceful composition, that\r\nthey want no assistance of mine, except as order is concerned. Bede\r\nhas eagerly dwelt on the praises of this man and his successors; and\r\nhas dilated on the Northumbrians at greater length, because they were\r\nhis near neighbours: our history, therefore, will select and compile\r\nfrom his relation. In order, however, that no one may blame me for\r\ncontracting so diffuse a narrative, I must tell him that I have done\r\nit purposely, that they who have been satiated with such high-seasoned\r\ndelicacies, may respire a little on these humble remnants: for it\r\nis a saying trite by use and venerable for its age, “that the meats\r\nwhich cloy the least are eaten with keenest appetite.” Ethelfrid\r\nthen, as I was relating, having obtained the kingdom, began at first\r\nvigorously to defend his own territories, afterwards eagerly to invade\r\nhis neighbours, and to seek occasion for signalizing himself on all\r\nsides. Many wars were begun by him with foresight, and terminated with\r\nsuccess; as he was neither restrained from duty by indolence, nor\r\nprecipitated into rashness by courage. An evidence of these things is\r\nDegstan,[61] a noted place in those parts, where Edan, king of the\r\nScots, envying Ethelfrid’s successes, had constrained him, though\r\naverse, to give battle; but, being overcome, he took to flight, though\r\nthe triumph was not obtained without considerable hazard to the victor.\r\nFor Tedbald, the brother of Ethelfrid, opposing himself to the most\r\nimminent dangers that he might display his zeal in his brother’s cause,\r\nleft a mournful victory indeed, being cut off with his whole party.\r\nAnother proof of his success is afforded by the city of Carlegion,\r\nnow commonly called Chester, which, till that period possessed by the\r\nBritons, fostered the pride of a people hostile to the king. When he\r\nbent his exertions to subdue this city, the townsmen preferring any\r\nextremity to a siege, and at the same confiding in their numbers,\r\nrushed out in multitudes to battle. But deceived by a stratagem, they\r\nwere overcome and put to flight; his fury being first vented on the\r\nmonks, who came out in numbers to pray for the safety of the army.\r\nThat their number was incredible to these times is apparent from so\r\nmany half-destroyed walls of churches in the neighbouring monastery,\r\nso many winding porticoes, such masses of ruins as can scarcely be\r\nseen elsewhere. The place is called Bangor; at that day a noted\r\nmonastery, but now changed into a cathedral.[62] Ethelfrid, thus, while\r\ncircumstances proceeded to his wishes abroad, being desirous of warding\r\noff domestic apprehensions and intestine danger, banished Edwin, the\r\nson of Alla, a youth of no mean worth, from his kingdom and country.\r\nHe, wandering for a long time without any settled habitation, found\r\nmany of his former friends more inclined to his enemy than to the\r\nobservance of their engagements; for as it is said,\r\n\r\n “If joy be thine, ’tis then thy friends abound:\r\n  Misfortune comes, and thou alone art found.”[63]\r\n\r\nAt last he came to Redwald, king of the East Angles, and bewailing his\r\nmisfortunes, was received into his protection. Shortly after there\r\ncame messengers from Ethelfrid, either demanding the surrender of the\r\nfugitive, or denouncing hostilities. Determined by the advice of his\r\nwife not to violate, through intimidation, the laws of friendship,\r\nRedwald collected a body of troops, rushed against Ethelfrid, and\r\nattacked him suddenly, whilst suspecting nothing less than an assault.\r\nThe only remedy that courage, thus taken by surprise, could suggest,\r\nthere being no time to escape, he availed himself of. Wherefore, though\r\nalmost totally unprepared, though beset with fearful danger on every\r\nside, he fell not till he had avenged his own death by the destruction\r\nof Regnhere, the son of Redwald. Such an end had Ethelfrid, after a\r\nreign of twenty-four years: a man second to none in martial experience,\r\nbut entirely ignorant of the holy faith. He had two sons by Acca, the\r\ndaughter of Alla, sister of Edwin, Oswald aged twelve, and Oswy four\r\nyears; who, upon the death of their father, fled through the management\r\nof their governors, and escaped into Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 617-633.] EDWIN.]\r\n\r\nIn this manner, all his rivals being slain or banished, Edwin, trained\r\nby many adversities, ascended, not meanly qualified, the summit of\r\npower. When the haughtiness of the Northumbrians had bent to his\r\ndominion, his felicity was crowned by the timely death of Redwald,\r\nwhose subjects, during Edwin’s exile among them, having formerly\r\nexperienced his ready courage and ardent disposition, now willingly\r\nswore obedience to him. Granting to the son of Redwald the empty\r\ntitle of king, himself managed all things as he thought fit. At this\r\njuncture, the hopes and the resources of the Angles centred totally\r\nin him; nor was there a single province of Britain which did not\r\nregard his will, and prepare to obey it, except Kent: for he had left\r\nthe Kentish people free from his incursions, because he had long\r\nmeditated a marriage with Ethelburga, sister of their king. When she\r\nwas granted to him, after a courtship long protracted, to the intent\r\nthat he should not despise that woman when possessed whom he so\r\nardently desired when withheld, these two kingdoms became so united\r\nby the ties of kindred, that, there was no rivalry in their powers,\r\nno difference in their manners. Moreover, on this occasion, the faith\r\nof Christ our Lord, infused into those parts by the preaching of\r\nPaulinus, reached first the king himself, whom the queen, among other\r\nproofs of conjugal affection, was perpetually instructing; nor was\r\nthe admonition of bishop Paulinus wanting in its place. For a long\r\ntime, he was wavering and doubtful; but once received, he imbibed it\r\naltogether. Then he invited neighbouring kings to the faith; then he\r\nerected churches, and neglected nothing for its propagation. In the\r\nmeanwhile, the merciful grace of God smiled on the devotion of the\r\nking; insomuch, that not only the nations of Britain, that is to say,\r\nthe Angles, Scots, and Picts, but even the Orkney and Mevanian isles,\r\nwhich we now call Anglesey, that is, islands of the Angles, both feared\r\nhis arms, and venerated his power. At that time, there was no public\r\nrobber; no domestic thief; the tempter of conjugal fidelity was far\r\ndistant; the plunderer of another man’s inheritance was in exile: a\r\nstate of things redounding to his praise, and worthy of celebration in\r\nour times. In short, such was the increase of his power, that justice\r\nand peace willingly met and kissed each other, imparting mutual acts\r\nof kindness. And now indeed would the government of the Angles have\r\nheld a prosperous course, had not an untimely death, the stepmother of\r\nall earthly felicity, by a lamentable turn of fortune, snatched this\r\nman from his country. For in the forty-eighth year of his age, and the\r\nseventeenth of his reign, being killed, together with his son, by the\r\nprinces whom he had formerly subjugated, Cadwalla of the Britons and\r\nPenda of the Mercians, rising up against him, he became a melancholy\r\nexample of human vicissitude. He was inferior to none in prudence: for\r\nhe would not embrace even the Christian faith till he had examined it\r\nmost carefully; but when once adopted, he esteemed nothing worthy to be\r\ncompared to it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 635.] OSWALD.]\r\n\r\nEdwin thus slain, the sons of Ethelfrid, who were also the nephews of\r\nEdwin, Oswald, and Oswy, now grown up, and in the budding prime of\r\nyouth, re-sought their country, together with Eanfrid, their elder\r\nbrother, whom I forgot before to mention. The kingdom, therefore, was\r\nnow divided into two. Indeed, Northumbria, long since separated into\r\ntwo provinces, had elected Alla, king of the Deirans, and Ida, of the\r\nBernicians. Wherefore Osric, the cousin of Edwin, succeeding to Deira,\r\nand Eanfrid, the son of Ethelfrid, to Bernicia, they exulted in the\r\nrecovery of their hereditary right. They had both been baptized in\r\nScotland, though they were scarcely settled in their authority, ere\r\nthey renounced their faith: but shortly after they suffered the just\r\npenalty of their apostacy through the hostility of Cadwalla. The space\r\nof a year, passed in these transactions, improved Oswald, a young man\r\nof great hope, in the science of government. Armed rather by his faith,\r\nfor he had been admitted to baptism while in exile with many nobles\r\namong the Scots, than by his military preparations, on the first onset\r\nhe drove Cadwalla,[64] a man elated with the recollection of his former\r\ndeeds, and, as he used himself to say, “born for the extermination of\r\nthe Angles,” from his camp, and afterwards destroyed him with all his\r\nforces. For when he had collected the little army which he was able\r\nto muster, he excited them to the conflict, in which, laying aside\r\nall thought of flight, they must determine either to conquer or die,\r\nby suggesting, “that it must be a circumstance highly disgraceful\r\nfor the Angles to meet the Britons on such unequal terms, as to fight\r\nagainst those persons for safety, whom they had been used voluntarily\r\nto attack for glory only; that therefore they should maintain their\r\nliberty with dauntless courage, and the most strenuous exertions; but,\r\nthat of the impulse to flight no feeling whatever should be indulged.”\r\nIn consequence they met with such fury on both sides, that, it may be\r\ntruly said, no day was ever more disastrous for the Britons, or more\r\njoyful for the Angles: so completely was one party routed with all\r\nits forces, as never to have hope of recovering again; so exceedingly\r\npowerful did the other become, through the effects of faith and the\r\naccompanying courage of the king. From this time, the worship of idols\r\nfell prostrate in the dust; and he governed the kingdom, extended\r\nbeyond Edwin’s boundaries, for eight years, peaceably and without\r\nthe loss of any of his people. Bede, in his History, sets forth the\r\npraises of this king in a high style of panegyric, of which I shall\r\nextract such portions as may be necessary, by way of conclusion. With\r\nwhat fervent faith his breast was inspired, may easily be learned\r\nfrom this circumstance. If at any time Aidan the priest addressed his\r\nauditors on the subject of their duty, in the Scottish tongue, and\r\nno interpreter was present, the king himself would directly, though\r\nhabited in the royal robe, glittering with gold, or glowing with\r\nTyrian purple, graciously assume that office, and explain the foreign\r\nidiom in his native language. It is well known too, that frequently\r\nat entertainments, when the guests had whetted their appetites\r\nand bent their inclinations on the feast, he would forego his own\r\ngratification;[65] procuring, by his abstinence, comfort for the poor.\r\nSo that I think the truth of that heavenly sentence was fulfilled even\r\non earth, where the celestial oracle hath said, “He that dispersed\r\nabroad, he hath given to the poor, his righteousness remaineth for\r\never.” And moreover, what the hearer must wonder at, and cannot deny,\r\nthat identical royal right hand, the dispenser of so many alms,\r\nremains to this day perfect, with the arm, the skin and nerves, though\r\nthe remainder of the body, with the exception of the bones, mouldering\r\ninto dust, has not escaped the common lot of mortality. It is true the\r\ncorporeal remains of some of the saints are unconscious altogether of\r\ndecay. Wherefore let others determine by what standard they will fix\r\ntheir judgment; I pronounce this still more gracious and divine on\r\naccount of its singular manifestation; because things ever so precious\r\ndegenerate by frequency, and whatever is more unusual, is celebrated\r\nmore generally. I should indeed be thought prolix were I to relate how\r\ndiligent he was to address his prayers on high, and to fill the heavens\r\nwith vows. This virtue of Oswald is too well known to require the\r\nsupport of our narrative. For at what time would that man neglect his\r\nsupplications, who, in the insurrection excited by Penda king of the\r\nMercians, his guards being put to flight and himself actually carrying\r\na forest of darts in his breast, could not be prevented by the pain\r\nof his wounds or the approach of death, from praying for the souls of\r\nhis faithful companions? In such manner this personage, of surpassing\r\ncelebrity in this world, and highly in favour with God, ending a\r\nvaluable life, transmitted his memory to posterity by a frequency of\r\nmiracles; and indeed most deservedly. For it is not common, but even\r\nmore rare than a white crow, for men to abound in riches, and not give\r\nindulgence to their vices.[66]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 642.] OSWALD.]\r\n\r\nWhen he was slain, his arms with the hands and his head were cut off\r\nby the insatiable rage of his conqueror, and fixed on a stake. The\r\ndead trunk indeed, as I have mentioned, being laid to rest in the\r\ncalm bosom of the earth, turned to its native dust; but the arms and\r\nhands, through the power of God, remain, according to the testimony\r\nof an author of veracity, without corruption. These being placed by\r\nhis brother Oswy in a shrine, at the city of Bebbanburg,[67] so the\r\nAngles call it, and shown for a miracle, bear testimony to the fact.\r\nWhether they remain at that place at the present day, I venture not\r\nrashly to affirm, because I waver in my opinion. If other historians\r\nhave precipitately recorded any matter, let them be accountable:\r\nI hold common report at a cheaper rate, and affirm nothing but\r\nwhat is deserving of entire credit. The head was then buried by his\r\nbefore-mentioned brother at Lindisfarne; but it is said now to be\r\npreserved at Durham in the arms of the blessed Cuthbert.[68] When\r\nOstritha, the wife of Ethelred, king of the Mercians, daughter of\r\nking Oswy, through regard to her uncle, was anxious to take the bones\r\nof the trunk to her monastery of Bardney, which is in the country of\r\nthe Mercians not far from the city of Lincoln, the monks refused her\r\nrequest at first; denying repose even to the bones of that man when\r\ndead whom they had hated whilst living, because he had obtained their\r\ncountry by right of arms. But at midnight being taught, by a miraculous\r\nlight from heaven shining on the relics, to abate their haughty pride,\r\nthey became converts to reason, and even entreated as a favour, what\r\nbefore they had rejected. Virtues from on high became resident in this\r\nplace: every sick person who implored this most excellent martyr’s\r\nassistance, immediately received it. The withering turf grew greener\r\nfrom his blood, and recovered a horse:[69] and some of it being hung up\r\nagainst a post, the devouring flames fled from it in their turn. Some\r\ndust, moistened from his relics, was equally efficacious in restoring\r\na lunatic to his proper senses. The washings of the stake which had\r\nimbibed the blood fresh streaming from his head, restored health to\r\none despairing of recovery. For a long time this monastery, possessing\r\nso great a treasure, flourished in the sanctity of its members and the\r\nabundance of its friends, more especially after king Ethelred received\r\nthe tonsure there, where also his tomb is seen even to the present day.\r\nAfter many years indeed, when the barbarians infested these parts, the\r\nbones of the most holy Oswald were removed to Gloucester. This place,\r\nat that period inhabited by monks, but at the present time by canons,\r\ncontains but few inmates. Oswald, therefore, was the man who yielded\r\nthe first fruits of holiness to his nation; since no Angle before him,\r\nto my knowledge, was celebrated for miracles. For after a life spent in\r\nsanctity, in liberally giving alms, in frequent watchings and prayer,\r\nand lastly, through zeal for the church of God, in waging war with an\r\nheathen, he poured out his spirit, according to his wishes, before he\r\ncould behold, what was his greatest object of apprehension, the decline\r\nof Christianity. Nor indeed shall he be denied the praise of the\r\nmartyrs, who, first aspiring after a holy life, and next opposing his\r\nbody to a glorious death, certainly trod in their steps: in a manner he\r\ndeserves higher commendation, since they barely consecrated themselves\r\nto God; but Oswald not only himself, but all the Northumbrians with him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 655-670.] OSWY. EGFRID.]\r\n\r\nOn his removal from this world, Oswy his brother assumed the dominion\r\nover the Bernicians, as did Oswin, the son of Osric, whom I have before\r\nmentioned, over the Deirans. After meeting temperately at first on\r\nthe subject of the division of the provinces, under a doubtful truce,\r\nthey each retired peaceably to their territories; but not long after,\r\nby means of persons who delighted in sowing the seeds of discord, the\r\npeace, of which they had so often made a mockery by ambiguous treaties,\r\nwas finally broken, and vanished into air. Horrid crime! that there\r\nshould be men who could envy these kings their friendly intimacy,\r\nnor abstain from using their utmost efforts to precipitate them into\r\nbattle. Here then fortune, who had before so frequently caressed Oswin\r\nwith her blandishments, now wounded him with her scorpion-sting.\r\nFor thinking it prudent to abstain from fighting, on account of the\r\nsmallness of his force, he had secretly withdrawn to a country-seat,\r\nwhere he was immediately betrayed by his own people, and killed by\r\nOswy. He was a man admirably calculated to gain the favour of his\r\nsubjects by his pecuniary liberality; and, as they relate, demonstrated\r\nhis care for his soul by his fervent devotion. Oswy, thus sovereign of\r\nthe entire kingdom, did every thing to wipe out this foul stain, and to\r\nincrease his dignity, extenuating the enormity of that atrocious deed\r\nby the rectitude of his future conduct. Indeed the first and highest\r\npoint of his glory is, that he nobly avenged his brother and his uncle,\r\nand gave to perdition Penda king of the Mercians, that destroyer of\r\nhis neighbours, and fomenter of hostility. From this period he either\r\ngoverned the Mercians, as well as almost all the Angles, himself,\r\nor was supreme over those who did. Turning from this time altogether\r\nto offices of piety, that he might be truly grateful for the favours\r\nof God perpetually flowing down upon him, he proceeded to raise up\r\nand animate, with all his power, the infancy of the Christian faith,\r\nwhich of late was fainting through his brother’s death. This faith,\r\nbrought shortly after to maturity by the learning of the Scots, but\r\nwavering in many ecclesiastical observances, was now settled on\r\ncanonical foundations:[70] first by Agilbert and Wilfrid, and next by\r\narchbishop Theodore: for whose arrival in Britain, although Egbert,\r\nking of Kent, as far as his province is concerned, takes much from his\r\nglory, the chief thanks are due to Oswy.[71] Moreover he built numerous\r\nhabitations for the servants of God, and so left not his country\r\ndestitute of this advantage also. The principal of these monasteries,\r\nat that time for females, but now for males, was situate about thirty\r\nmiles north of York, and was anciently called Streaneshalch, but\r\nlatterly Whitby. Begun by Hilda, a woman of singular piety, it was\r\naugmented with large revenues by Elfled, daughter of this king, who\r\nsucceeded her in the government of it; in which place also she buried\r\nher father with all due solemnity, after he had reigned twenty-eight\r\nyears. This monastery, like all others of the same order, was destroyed\r\nin the times of the Danish invasion, which will be related hereafter,\r\nand bereaved of the bodies of many saints. For the bones of St. Aidan\r\nthe bishop, of Ceolfrid the abbat, and of that truly holy virgin Hilda,\r\ntogether with those of many others, were, as I have related in the book\r\nwhich I lately published on the Antiquity of the Church of Glastonbury,\r\nat that time removed to Glastonbury; and those of other saints to\r\ndifferent places. Now the monastery, under another name, and somewhat\r\nrestored as circumstances permitted, hardly presents a vestige of its\r\nformer opulence.\r\n\r\nTo Oswy, who had two sons, the elder who was illegitimate being\r\nrejected, succeeded the younger, Egfrid, legitimately born, more valued\r\non account of the good qualities of his most pious wife Etheldrida,\r\nthan for his own; yet he was certainly to be commended for two\r\nthings which I have read in the history of the Angles, his allowing\r\nhis wife to dedicate herself to God, and his promoting the blessed\r\nCuthbert to a bishopric, whose tears at the same time burst out with\r\npious assent.[72] But my mind shudders at the bare recollection of\r\nhis outrage against the holy Wilfrid, when, loathing his virtues, he\r\ndeprived the country of this shining character. Overbearing towards\r\nthe suppliant, a malady incident to tyrants, he overwhelmed the Irish,\r\na race of men harmless in genuine simplicity and guiltless of every\r\ncrime, with incredible slaughter. On the other hand, inactive towards\r\nthe rebellious, and not following up the triumphs of his father,\r\nhe lost the dominion of the Mercians, and moreover, defeated in\r\nbattle by Ethelred the son of Penda, their king, he lost his brother\r\nalso. Perhaps these last circumstances may be truly attributed to\r\nthe unsteadiness of youth, but his conduct towards Wilfrid, to the\r\ninstigation of his wife,[73] and of the bishops; more especially as\r\nBede, a man who knew not how to flatter, calls him, in his book of\r\nthe Lives of his Abbats, the most pious man, the most beloved by God.\r\nAt length, in the fifteenth year of his reign, as he was leading\r\nan expedition against the Picts, and eagerly pursuing them as they\r\npurposely retired to some secluded mountains, he perished with almost\r\nall his forces; the few who escaped by flight carried home news of\r\nthe event; and yet the divine Cuthbert, from his knowledge of future\r\nevents, had both attempted to keep him back, when departing, and at the\r\nvery moment of his death, enlightened by heavenly influence, declared,\r\nthough at a distance, that he was slain.\r\n\r\nWhile a more than common report every where noised the death of Egfrid,\r\nan intimation of it, “borne on the wings of haste,” reached the ears of\r\nhis brother Alfrid. Though the elder brother, he had been deemed, by\r\nthe nobility, unworthy of the government, from his illegitimacy, as I\r\nhave observed, and had retired to Ireland, either through compulsion or\r\nindignation. In this place, safe from the persecution of his brother,\r\nhe had, from his ample leisure, become deeply versed in literature, and\r\nhad enriched his mind with every kind of learning. On which account the\r\nvery persons who had formerly banished him, esteeming him the better\r\nqualified to manage the reins of government, now sent for him of their\r\nown accord. Fate rendered efficacious their entreaties; neither did he\r\ndisappoint their expectations. For during the space of nineteen years,\r\nhe presided over the kingdom in the utmost tranquillity and joy; doing\r\nnothing that even greedy calumny itself could justly carp at, except\r\nthe persecution of that great man Wilfrid. However he held not the\r\nsame extent of territory as his father and brother, because the Picts,\r\nproudly profiting by their recent victory, and attacking the Angles,\r\nwho were become indolent through a lengthened peace, had curtailed his\r\nboundaries on the north.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 685-730.] OSRED.--CEOLWULF.]\r\n\r\nHe had for successor his son, Osred, a boy of eight years old; who\r\ndisgracing the throne for eleven years, and spending an ignominious\r\nlife in the seduction of nuns, was ultimately taken off by the\r\nhostility of his relations. Yet he poured out to them a draught\r\nfrom the same cup; for Kenred after reigning two, and Osric eleven\r\nyears, left only this to be recorded of them; that they expiated by\r\na violent death, the blood of their master, whom they supposed they\r\nhad rightfully slain. Osric indeed deserved a happier end, for, as a\r\nheathen[74] says, he was more dignified than other shades, because,\r\nwhile yet living he had adopted Ceolwulf, Kenred’s brother, as his\r\nsuccessor. Then Ceolwulf ascended the giddy height of empire, seventh\r\nin descent from Ida: a man competent in other respects, and withal\r\npossessed of a depth of literature, acquired by good abilities and\r\nindefatigable attention. Bede vouches for the truth of my assertion,\r\nwho, at the very juncture when Britain most abounded with scholars,\r\noffered his History of the Angles, for correction, to this prince more\r\nespecially; making choice of his authority, to confirm by his high\r\nstation what had been well written; and of his learning, to rectify by\r\nhis talents what might be carelessly expressed.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth year of his reign, Bede, the historian, after having\r\nwritten many books for the holy church, entered the heavenly kingdom,\r\nfor which he had so long languished, in the year of our Lord’s\r\nincarnation 734; of his age the fifty-ninth. A man whom it is easier\r\nto admire than worthily to extol: who, though born in a remote corner\r\nof the world, was able to dazzle the whole earth with the brilliancy\r\nof his learning. For even Britain, which by some is called another\r\nworld, since, surrounded by the ocean, it was not thoroughly known\r\nby many geographers, possesses, in its remotest region, bordering\r\non Scotland, the place of his birth and education. This region,\r\nformerly exhaling the grateful odour of monasteries, or glittering\r\nwith a multitude of cities built by the Romans, now desolate through\r\nthe ancient devastations of the Danes, or those more recent of the\r\nNormans,[75] presents but little to allure the mind. Here is the river\r\nWear, of considerable breadth and rapid tide; which running into the\r\nsea, receives the vessels, borne by gentle gales, on the calm bosom\r\nof its haven. Both its banks[76] have been made conspicuous by one\r\nBenedict,[77] who there built churches and monasteries; one dedicated\r\nto Peter, and the other to Paul, united in the bond of brotherly love\r\nand of monastic rule. The industry and forbearance of this man, any\r\none will admire who reads the book which Bede composed concerning his\r\nlife and those of the succeeding abbats: his industry, in bringing\r\nover a multitude of books, and being the first person who introduced\r\nin England constructors of stone edifices, as well as makers of glass\r\nwindows; in which pursuits he spent almost his whole life abroad:\r\nthe love of his country and his taste for elegance beguiling his\r\npainful labours, in the earnest desire of conveying something to his\r\ncountrymen out of the common way; for very rarely before the time of\r\nBenedict were buildings of stone[78] seen in Britain, nor did the\r\nsolar ray cast its light through the transparent glass. Again, his\r\nforbearance: for when in possession of the monastery of St. Augustine\r\nat Canterbury, he cheerfully resigned it to Adrian, when he arrived,\r\nnot as fearing the severity of St. Theodore the archbishop, but bowing\r\nto his authority. And farther, while long absent abroad, he endured not\r\nonly with temper, but, I may say, with magnanimity, the substitution of\r\nanother abbat, without his knowledge, by the monks of Wearmouth; and\r\non his return, admitted him to equal honour with himself, in rank and\r\npower. Moreover, when stricken so severely with the palsy that he could\r\nmove none of his limbs, he appointed a third abbat, because the other,\r\nof whom we have spoken, was not less affected by the same disease. And\r\nwhen the disorder, increasing, was just about to seize his vitals, he\r\nbade adieu to his companion, who was brought into his presence, with\r\nan inclination of the head only; nor was he better able to return the\r\nsalutation, for he was hastening to a still nearer exit, and actually\r\ndied before Benedict.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 690.] CEOLFRID.]\r\n\r\nCeolfrid succeeded, under whom the affairs of the monastery flourished\r\nbeyond measure. When, through extreme old age, life ceased to be\r\ndesirable, he purposed going to Rome, that he might pour out, as he\r\nhoped, his aged soul an offering to the apostles his masters. But\r\nfailing of the object of his desires, he paid the debt of nature at the\r\ncity of Langres. The relics of his bones were in after time conveyed\r\nto his monastery; and at the period of the Danish devastation, with\r\nthose of St. Hilda, were taken to Glastonbury.[79] The merits of these\r\nabbats, sufficiently eminent in themselves, their celebrated pupil,\r\nBede, crowns with superior splendour. It is written indeed, “A wise son\r\nis the glory of his father:” for one of them made him a monk, the other\r\neducated him. And since Bede himself has given some slight notices of\r\nthese facts, comprising his whole life in a kind of summary, it may be\r\nallowed to turn to his words, which the reader will recognize, lest any\r\nvariation of the style should affect the relation. At the end then of\r\nthe Ecclesiastical History of the English[80] this man, as praiseworthy\r\nin other respects as in this, that he withheld nothing from posterity,\r\nthough it might be only a trifling knowledge of himself, says thus:\r\n\r\n“I, Bede, the servant of Christ, and priest of the monastery of the\r\nholy apostles Peter and Paul, which is at Wearmouth, have, by God’s\r\nassistance, arranged these materials for the history of Britain. I was\r\nborn within the possessions of this monastery, and at seven years of\r\nage, was committed, by the care of my relations, to the most reverend\r\nabbat Benedict, to be educated, and, after, to Ceolfrid; passing\r\nthe remainder of my life from that period in residence at the said\r\nmonastery, I have given up my whole attention to the study of the\r\nScriptures, and amid the observance of my regular discipline and my\r\ndaily duty of singing in the church, have ever delighted to learn,\r\nto teach, or to write. In the nineteenth year of my life, I took\r\ndeacon’s, in the thirtieth, priest’s orders; both, at the instance of\r\nabbat Ceolfrid, by the ministry of the most reverend bishop John:[81]\r\nfrom which time of receiving the priesthood till the fifty-ninth year\r\nof my age, I have been employed for the benefit of myself or of my\r\nfriends, in making these extracts from the works of the venerable\r\nfathers, or in making additions, according to the form of their\r\nsense or interpretation.” Then enumerating thirty-six volumes which\r\nhe published in seventy-eight books, he proceeds, “And I pray most\r\nearnestly, O merciful Jesus, that thou wouldst grant me, to whom thou\r\nhast already given the knowledge of thyself, finally to come to thee,\r\nthe fountain of all wisdom, and to appear for ever in thy presence.\r\nMoreover I humbly entreat all persons, whether readers or hearers,\r\nwhom this history of our nation shall reach, that they be mindful to\r\nintercede with the divine clemency for my infirmities both of mind\r\nand of body, and that, in their several provinces, they make me this\r\ngrateful return; that I, who have diligently laboured to record, of\r\nevery province, or of more exalted places, what appeared worthy of\r\npreservation or agreeable to the inhabitants, may receive, from all,\r\nthe benefit of their pious intercessions.”\r\n\r\nHere my abilities fail, here my eloquence falls short: ignorant which\r\nto praise most, the number of his writings, or the gravity of his\r\nstyle. No doubt he had imbibed a large portion of heavenly wisdom,\r\nto be able to compose so many volumes within the limits of so short\r\na life. Nay, they even report, that he went to Rome for the purpose\r\neither of personally asserting that his writings were consistent with\r\nthe doctrines of the church; or of correcting them by apostolical\r\nauthority, should they be found repugnant thereto. That he went to Rome\r\nI do not however affirm for fact: but I have no doubt in declaring that\r\nhe was invited thither, as the following epistle will certify; as well\r\nas that the see of Rome so highly esteemed him as greatly to desire his\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 701.] SERGIUS’S EPISTLE.]\r\n\r\n“_Sergius the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to Ceolfrid the\r\nholy abbat sendeth greeting_:--\r\n\r\n“With what words, and in what manner, can we declare the kindness\r\nand unspeakable providence of our God, and return fit thanks for his\r\nboundless benefits, who leads us, when placed in darkness, and the\r\nshadow of death, to the light of knowledge?” And below, “Know, that\r\nwe received the favour of the offering which your devout piety hath\r\nsent by the present bearer, with the same joy and goodwill with which\r\nit was transmitted. We assent to the timely and becoming prayers of\r\nyour laudable anxiety with deepest regard, and entreat of your pious\r\ngoodness, so acceptable to God, that, since there have occurred certain\r\npoints of ecclesiastical discipline, not to be promulgated without\r\nfarther examination, which have made it necessary for us to confer with\r\na person skilled in literature, as becomes an assistant of God’s holy\r\nuniversal motherchurch, you would not delay paying ready obedience\r\nto this, our admonition; but would send without loss of time, to our\r\nlowly presence, at the church of the chief apostles, my lords Peter\r\nand Paul, your friends and protectors, that religious servant of God,\r\nBede, the venerable priest of your monastery; whom, God willing, you\r\nmay expect to return in safety, when the necessary discussion of\r\nthe above-mentioned points shall be, by God’s assistance, solemnly\r\ncompleted: for whatever may be added to the church at large, by his\r\nassistance, will, we trust, be profitable to the things committed to\r\nyour immediate care.”\r\n\r\nSo extensive was his fame then, that even the majesty of Rome itself\r\nsolicited his assistance in solving abstruse questions, nor did Gallic\r\nconceit ever find in this Angle any thing justly to blame. All the\r\nwestern world yielded the palm to his faith and authority; for indeed\r\nhe was of sound faith, and of artless, yet pleasing eloquence: in all\r\nelucidations of the holy scriptures, discussing those points from which\r\nthe reader might imbibe the love of God, and of his neighbour, rather\r\nthan those which might charm by their wit, or polish a rugged style.\r\nMoreover the irrefragable truth of that sentence, which the majesty\r\nof divine wisdom proclaimed to the world forbids any one to doubt the\r\nsanctity of his life, “Wisdom will not enter the malevolent soul, nor\r\ndwell in the person of the sinful;” which indeed is said not of earthly\r\nwisdom, which is infused promiscuously into the hearts of men, and in\r\nwhich, even the wicked, who continue their crimes until their last day,\r\nseem often to excel, according to the divine expression, “The sons of\r\nthis world are in their generation wiser than the children of light;”\r\nbut it rather describes that wisdom which needs not the assistance\r\nof learning, and which dismisses from its cogitations those things\r\nwhich are void of understanding, that is to say, of the understanding\r\nof acting and speaking properly. Hence Seneca in his book, “De\r\nCausis,”[82] appositely relates that Cato, defining the duty of an\r\norator, said, “An orator is a good man, skilled in speaking.” This\r\necclesiastical orator, then, used to purify his knowledge, that so he\r\nmight, as far as possible, unveil the meaning of mystic writings. How\r\nindeed could that man be enslaved to vice who gave his whole soul and\r\nspirit to elucidate the scriptures? For, as he confesses in his third\r\nbook on Samuel, if his expositions were productive of no advantage to\r\nhis readers, yet were they of considerable importance to himself,\r\ninasmuch as, while fully intent upon them, he escaped the vanity and\r\nempty imaginations of the times. Purified from vice, therefore, he\r\nentered within the inner veil, divulging in pure diction the sentiments\r\nof his mind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 735.] DEATH OF BEDE.]\r\n\r\nBut the unspotted sanctity and holy purity of his heart were chiefly\r\nconspicuous on the approach of death. Although for seven weeks\r\nsuccessively, from the indisposition of his stomach, he nauseated all\r\nfood, and was troubled with such a difficulty of breathing that his\r\ndisorder confined him to his bed, yet he by no means abandoned his\r\nliterary avocations. During whole days he endeavoured to mitigate\r\nthe pressure of his disorder and to lose the recollection of it by\r\nconstant lectures to his pupils, and by examining and solving abstruse\r\nquestions, in addition to his usual task of psalmody. Moreover the\r\ngospel of St. John, which from its difficulty exercises the talents of\r\nits readers even to the present day, was translated by him into the\r\nEnglish language, and accommodated to those who did not understand\r\nLatin. Occasionally, also, would he admonish his disciples, saying,\r\n“Learn, my children, while I am with you, for I know not how long I\r\nshall continue; and although my Maker should very shortly take me\r\nhence, and my spirit should return to him that sent and granted it to\r\ncome into this life, yet have I lived long, God hath rightly appointed\r\nmy portion of days, I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ.”\r\n\r\nOften too when the balance was poised between hope and fear, he would\r\nremark “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living\r\nGod.[83] I have not passed my life among you in such manner as to be\r\nashamed to live, neither do I fear to die, because we have a kind\r\nMaster;” thus borrowing the expression of St. Ambrose when dying.\r\nHappy man! who could speak with so quiet a conscience as neither being\r\nashamed to live, nor afraid to die; on the one hand not fearing the\r\njudgment of men, on the other waiting with composure the hidden will of\r\nGod. Often, when urged by extremity of pain, he comforted himself with\r\nthese remarks, “The furnace tries the gold, and the fire of temptation\r\nthe just man: the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be\r\ncompared to the future glory which shall be revealed in us.”[84] Tears\r\nand a difficulty of breathing accompanied his words. At night, when\r\nthere were none to be instructed or to note down his remarks, he passed\r\nthe whole season in giving thanks and singing psalms, fulfilling the\r\nsaying of that very wise man,[85] “that he was never less alone than\r\nwhen alone.” If at any time a short and disturbed sleep stole upon his\r\neye-lids, he immediately shook it off, and showed that his affections\r\nwere always intent on God, by exclaiming “Lift me up, O Lord, that the\r\nproud calumniate me not. Do with thy servant according to thy mercy.”\r\nThese and similar expressions which his shattered memory suggested,\r\nflowed spontaneously from his lips whenever the pain of his agonizing\r\ndisorder became mitigated. But on the Tuesday before our Lord’s\r\nascension his disease rapidly increased, and there appeared a small\r\nswelling in his feet, the sure and certain indication of approaching\r\ndeath. Then the congregation being called together, he was anointed and\r\nreceived the sacrament. Kissing them all, and requesting from each that\r\nthey would bear him in remembrance, he gave a small present, which he\r\nhad privately reserved, to some with whom he had been in closer bonds\r\nof friendship. On Ascension day, when his soul, tired of the frail\r\noccupation of the body, panted to be free, lying down on a hair-cloth\r\nnear the oratory, where he used to pray, with sense unimpaired and\r\njoyful countenance, he invited the grace of the Holy Spirit, saying, “O\r\nKing of glory, Lord of virtue, who ascendedst this day triumphant into\r\nthe heavens, leave us not destitute, but send upon us the promise of\r\nthe Father, the Spirit of truth.” This prayer ended, he breathed his\r\nlast, and immediately the senses of all were pervaded by an odour such\r\nas neither cinnamon nor balm could give, but coming, as it were, from\r\nparadise, and fraught with all the joyous exhalations of spring. At\r\nthat time he was buried in the same monastery, but at present, report\r\nasserts that he lies at Durham with St. Cuthbert.\r\n\r\nWith this man was buried almost all knowledge of history down to our\r\ntimes, inasmuch as there has been no Englishman either emulous of his\r\npursuits, or a follower of his graces, who could continue the thread\r\nof his discourse, now broken short. Some few indeed, “whom the mild\r\nJesus loved,” though well skilled in literature, have yet observed an\r\nungracious silence throughout their lives; others, scarcely tasting of\r\nthe stream, have fostered a criminal indolence. Thus to the slothful\r\nsucceeded others more slothful still, and the warmth of science for a\r\nlong time decreased throughout the island. The verses of his epitaph\r\nwill afford sufficient specimen of this indolence; they are indeed\r\ncontemptible, and unworthy the tomb of so great a man:\r\n\r\n “Presbyter hic Beda, requiescit carne sepultus;\r\n  Dona, Christe, animam in cœlis gaudere per ævum:\r\n  Daque illi sophiæ debriari fonte, cui jam\r\n  Suspiravit ovans, intento semper amore.”[86]\r\n\r\nCan this disgrace be extenuated by any excuse, that there was not to\r\nbe found even in that monastery, where during his lifetime the school\r\nof all learning had flourished, a single person who could write his\r\nepitaph, except in this mean and paltry style? But enough of this: I\r\nwill return to my subject.\r\n\r\nCeolwulf thinking it beneath the dignity of a Christian to be immersed\r\nin earthly things, abdicated the throne after a reign of eight years,\r\nand assumed the monastic habit at Lindisfarne, in which place how\r\nmeritoriously he lived, is amply testified by his being honourably\r\ninterred near St. Cuthbert, and by many miracles vouchsafed from on\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 737, 738.] KING EADBERT.]\r\n\r\nHe had made provision against the state’s being endangered, by placing\r\nhis cousin, Eadbert,[87] on the throne, which he filled for twenty\r\nyears with singular moderation and virtue. Eadbert had a brother\r\nof the same name, archbishop of York, who, by his own prudence and\r\nthe power of the king, restored that see to its original state.\r\nFor, as is well known to any one conversant in the history of the\r\nAngles,[88] Paulinus, the first prelate of the church of York, had\r\nbeen forcibly driven away, and died at Rochester, where he left that\r\nhonourable distinction of the pall which he had received from pope\r\nHonorius. After him, many prelates of this august city, satisfied\r\nwith the name of a simple bishopric, aspired to nothing higher: but\r\nwhen Eadbert was seated on the throne, a man of loftier spirit, and\r\none who thought, that, “as it is over-reaching to require what is not\r\nour due, so is it ignoble to neglect our right,” he reclaimed the\r\npall by frequent appeals to the pope. This personage, if I may be\r\nallowed the expression, was the depository and receptacle of every\r\nliberal art; and founded a most noble library at York. For this I\r\ncite Alcuin,[89] as competent witness; who was sent from the kings\r\nof England to the emperor Charles the Great, to treat of peace, and\r\nbeing hospitably entertained by him, observes, in a letter to Eanbald,\r\nthird in succession from Eadbert, “Praise and glory be to God, who\r\nhath preserved my days in full prosperity, that I should rejoice in\r\nthe exaltation of my dearest son, who laboured in my stead, in the\r\nchurch where I had been brought up and educated, and presided over the\r\ntreasures of wisdom, to which my beloved master, archbishop Egbert,\r\nleft me heir.” Thus too to Charles Augustus:[90] “Give me the more\r\npolished volumes of scholastic learning, such as I used to have in my\r\nown country, through the laudable and ardent industry of my master,\r\narchbishop Egbert. And, if it please your wisdom, I will send some of\r\nour youths, who may obtain thence whatever is necessary, and bring back\r\ninto France the flowers of Britain; that the garden of Paradise may not\r\nbe confined to York, but that some of its scions may be transplanted to\r\nTours.”\r\n\r\nThis is the same Alcuin, who, as I have said, was sent into France to\r\ntreat of peace, and during his abode with Charles, captivated either by\r\nthe pleasantness of the country or the kindness of the king, settled\r\nthere; and being held in high estimation, he taught the king, during\r\nhis leisure from the cares of state, a thorough knowledge of logic,\r\nrhetoric, and astronomy. Alcuin was, of all the Angles, of whom I have\r\nread, next to St. Aldhelm and Bede, certainly the most learned, and has\r\ngiven proof of his talents in a variety of compositions. He lies buried\r\nin France, at the church of St. Paul, of Cormaric,[91] which monastery\r\nCharles the Great built at his suggestion: on which account, even at\r\nthe present day, the subsistence of four monks is distributed in alms,\r\nfor the soul of our Alcuin, in that church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 738.] KINGS OF FRANCE.]\r\n\r\nBut since I am arrived at that point where the mention of Charles the\r\nGreat naturally presents itself, I shall subjoin a true statement of\r\nthe descent of the kings of France, of which antiquity has said much:\r\nnor shall I depart widely from my design; because to be unacquainted\r\nwith their race, I hold as a defect in information; seeing that they\r\nare our near neighbours, and to them the Christian world chiefly looks\r\nup: and, perhaps, to glance over this compendium may give pleasure to\r\nmany who have not leisure to wade through voluminous works.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 747-937.] CAROLOMAN--CHARLEMAGNE--LOUIS.]\r\n\r\nThe Franks were so called, by a Greek appellative, from the ferocity\r\nof their manners, when, by order of the emperor Valentinian the First,\r\nthey ejected the Alani, who had retreated to the Mæotian marshes. It\r\nis scarcely possible to believe how much this people, few and mean at\r\nfirst, became increased by a ten years’ exemption from taxes: such,\r\nbefore the war, being the condition on which they engaged in it.\r\nThus augmenting wonderfully by the acquisition of freedom, and first\r\nseizing the greatest part of Germany, and next the whole of Gaul,\r\nthey compelled the inhabitants to list under their banners. Hence the\r\nLotharingi and Allamanni, and other nations beyond the Rhine, who are\r\nsubject to the emperor of Germany, will have themselves more properly\r\nto be called Franks; and those whom we suppose Franks, they call by an\r\nancient appellative Galwalæ, that is to say, Gauls. To this opinion\r\nI assent; knowing that Charles the Great, whom none can deny to have\r\nbeen king of the Franks, always used the same vernacular language with\r\nthe Franks on the other side of the Rhine. Any one who shall read the\r\nlife of Charles will readily admit the truth of my assertion.[92] In\r\nthe year then of the Incarnate Word 425 the Franks were governed by\r\nFaramund, their first king. The grandson of Faramund was Meroveus,\r\nfrom whom all the succeeding kings of the Franks, to the time of\r\nPepin, were called Merovingians. In like manner the sons of the kings\r\nof the Angles took patronymical appellations from their fathers. For\r\ninstance; Eadgaring the son of Edgar; Eadmunding the son of Edmund, and\r\nthe rest in like manner; commonly, however, they are called ethelings.\r\nThe native language of the Franks, therefore, partakes of that of\r\nthe Angles, by reason of both nations originating from Germany. The\r\nMerovingians reigned successfully and powerfully till the year of our\r\nLord’s incarnation, 687. At that period Pepin, son of Ansegise, was\r\nmade mayor of the palace[93] among the Franks, on the other side of\r\nthe Rhine. Seizing opportunities for veiling his ambitious views, he\r\ncompletely subjugated his master Theodoric, the dregs as it were of the\r\nMerovingians, and to lessen the obloquy excited by the transaction,\r\nhe indulged him with the empty title of king, while himself managed\r\nevery thing, at home and abroad, according to his own pleasure. The\r\ngenealogy of this Pepin, both to and from him, is thus traced: Ausbert,\r\nthe senator, on Blithilde, the daughter of Lothaire, the father of\r\nDagobert, begot Arnold: Arnold begot St. Arnulph, bishop of Metz:\r\nArnulph begot Flodulph, Walcthise, Anschise: Flodulph begot duke\r\nMartin, whom Ebroin slew: Walcthise begot the most holy Wandregesil\r\nthe abbat: duke Anschise begot Ansegise: Ansegise begot Pepin. The son\r\nof Pepin was Carolus Tudites, whom they also call Martel, because he\r\nbeat down the tyrants who were raising up in every part of France, and\r\nnobly defeated the Saracens, at that time infesting Gaul. Following\r\nthe practice of his father, whilst he was himself satisfied with the\r\ntitle of earl, he kept the kings in a state of pupilage. He left\r\ntwo sons, Pepin and Caroloman. Caroloman, from some unknown cause,\r\nrelinquishing the world, took his religious vows at Mount Cassin. Pepin\r\nwas crowned king of the Franks, and patrician of the Romans, in the\r\nchurch of St. Denys, by pope Stephen, the successor of Zachary. For\r\nthe Constantinopolitan emperors, already much degenerated from their\r\nancient valour, giving no assistance either to Italy or the church of\r\nRome, which had long groaned under the tyranny of the Lombards, this\r\npope bewailed the injuries to which they were exposed from them to\r\nthe ruler of the Franks; wherefore Pepin passing the Alps, reduced\r\nDesiderius, king of the Lombards, to such difficulties, that he\r\nrestored what he had plundered to the church of Rome, and gave surety\r\nby oath that he would not attempt to resume it. Pepin returning to\r\nFrance after some years, died, leaving his surviving children, Charles\r\nand Caroloman, his heirs. In two years Caroloman departed this life.\r\nCharles obtaining the name of “Great” from his exploits, enlarged the\r\nkingdom to twice the limits which it possessed in his father’s time,\r\nand being contented for more than thirty years with the simple title\r\nof king, abstained from the appellation of emperor, though repeatedly\r\ninvited to assume it by pope Adrian. But when, after the death of this\r\npontiff, his relations maimed the holy Leo, his successors in the\r\nchurch of St. Peter, so as to cut out his tongue, and put out his eyes,\r\nCharles hastily proceeded to Rome to settle the state of the church.\r\nJustly punishing these abandoned wretches, he stayed there the whole\r\nwinter, and restored the pontiff, now speaking plainly and seeing\r\nclearly, by the miraculous interposition of God, to his customary\r\npower. At that time the Roman people, with the privity of the pontiff,\r\non the day of our Lord’s nativity, unexpectedly hailed him with the\r\ntitle of Augustus; which title, though, from its being unusual, he\r\nreluctantly admitted, yet afterwards he defended with proper spirit\r\nagainst the Constantinopolitan emperors, and left it, as hereditary,\r\nto his son Louis. His descendants reigned in that country, which is\r\nnow properly called France, till the time of Hugh, surnamed Capet,\r\nfrom whom is descended the present Louis. From the same stock came the\r\nsovereigns of Germany and Italy, till the year of our Lord 912, when\r\nConrad, king of the Teutonians, seized that empire. The grandson of\r\nthis personage was Otho the Great, equal in every estimable quality to\r\nany of the emperors who preceded him. Thus admirable for his valour\r\nand goodness, he left the empire hereditary to his posterity; for\r\nthe present Henry, son-in-law of Henry, king of England, derives his\r\nlineage from his blood.\r\n\r\nTo return to my narrative: Alcuin, though promoted by Charles the Great\r\nto the monastery of St. Martin in France, was not unmindful of his\r\ncountrymen, but exerted himself to retain the emperor in amity with\r\nthem, and stimulated them to virtue by frequent epistles. I shall here\r\nsubjoin many of his observations, from which it will appear clearly how\r\nsoon after the death of Bede the love of learning declined even in his\r\nown monastery: and how quickly after the decease of Eadbert the kingdom\r\nof the Northumbrians came to ruin, through the prevalence of degenerate\r\nmanners.\r\n\r\nHe says thus to the monks of Wearmouth, among whom Bede had both lived\r\nand died, obliquely accusing them of having done the very thing which\r\nhe begs them not to do, “Let the youths be accustomed to attend the\r\npraises of our heavenly King, not to dig up the burrows of foxes,\r\nor pursue the winding mazes of hares; let them now learn the Holy\r\nScriptures, that, when grown up, they may be able to instruct others.\r\nRemember the most noble teacher of our times, Bede, the priest, what\r\nthirst for learning he had in his youth, what praise he now has among\r\nmen, and what a far greater reward of glory with God.” Again, to those\r\nof York he says, “The Searcher of my heart is witness that it was not\r\nfor lust of gold that I came to France or continued there, but for the\r\nnecessities of the church.” And thus to Offa, king of the Mercians, “I\r\nwas prepared to come to you with the presents of king Charles and to\r\nreturn to my country, but it seemed more advisable to me, for the peace\r\nof my nation, to remain abroad, not knowing what I could have done\r\namong those persons, with whom no one can be secure, or able to proceed\r\nin any laudable pursuit. Behold every holy place is laid desolate by\r\nPagans, the altars are polluted by perjury, the monasteries dishonoured\r\nby adultery, the earth itself stained with the blood of rulers and\r\nof princes.” Again, to king Ethelred, third in the sovereignty after\r\nEadbert, “Behold the church of St. Cuthbert is sprinkled with the\r\nblood of God’s priests, despoiled of all its ornaments, and the holiest\r\nspot in Britain given up to Pagan nations to be plundered; and where,\r\nafter the departure of St. Paulinus from York, the Christian religion\r\nfirst took its rise in our own nation, there misery and calamity took\r\ntheir rise also. What portends that shower of blood which in the time\r\nof Lent, in the city of York, the capital of the whole kingdom, in the\r\nchurch of St. Peter, the chief of the apostles, we saw tremendously\r\nfalling on the northern side of the building from the summit of the\r\nroof, though the weather was fair? Must not blood be expected to come\r\nupon the land from the northern regions?” Again, to Osbert, prince of\r\nthe Mercians, “Our kingdom of the Northumbrians has almost perished\r\nthrough internal dissensions and perjury.” So also to Athelard,\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, “I speak this on account of the scourge which\r\nhas lately fallen on that part of our island which has been inhabited\r\nby our forefathers for nearly three hundred and forty years. It is\r\nrecorded in the writings of Gildas, the wisest of the Britons, that\r\nthose very Britons ruined their country through the avarice and rapine\r\nof their princes, the iniquity and injustice of their judges, their\r\nbishops’ neglect of preaching, the luxury and abandoned manners of the\r\npeople. Let us be cautious that such vices become not prevalent in our\r\ntimes, in order that the divine favour may preserve our country to us\r\nin that happy prosperity for the future which it has hitherto in its\r\nmost merciful kindness vouchsafed us.”\r\n\r\nIt has been made evident, I think, what disgrace and what destruction\r\nthe neglect of learning and the immoral manners of degenerate men\r\nbrought upon England! These remarks obtain this place in my history\r\nmerely for the purpose of cautioning my readers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 758.] OSWULPH.]\r\n\r\nEadbert, then, rivalling his brother in piety, assumed the monastic\r\nhabit, and gave place to Oswulph, his son, who being, without any cause\r\non his part, slain by his subjects, was, after a twelvemonth’s reign,\r\nsucceeded by Moll. Moll carried on the government with commendable\r\ndiligence for eleven years,[94] and then fell a victim to the treachery\r\nof Alcred. Alcred in his tenth year was compelled by his countrymen\r\nto retire from the government which he had usurped. Ethelred too, the\r\nson of Moll, being elected king, was expelled by them at the end of\r\nfive years. Alfwold was next hailed sovereign; but he also, at the end\r\nof eleven years, experienced the perfidy of the inhabitants, for he\r\nwas cut off by assassination, though guiltless, as his distinguished\r\ninterment at Hexham and divine miracles sufficiently declare. His\r\nnephew, Osred,[95] the son of Alcred, succeeding him, was expelled\r\nafter the space of a year, and gave place to Ethelred, who was also\r\ncalled Ethelbert. He was the son of Moll, also called Ethelwald, and,\r\nobtaining the kingdom after twelve years of exile, held it during\r\nfour, at the end of which time, unable to escape the fate of his\r\npredecessors, he was cruelly murdered. At this, many of the bishops\r\nand nobles greatly shocked, fled from the country. Some indeed affirm\r\nthat he was punished deservedly, because he had assented to the unjust\r\nmurder of Osred, whereas he had it in his power to quit the sovereignty\r\nand restore him to his throne. Of the beginning of this reign Alcuin\r\nthus speaks: “Blessed be God, the only worker of miracles, Ethelred,\r\nthe son of Ethelwald, went lately from the dungeon to the throne, from\r\nmisery to grandeur; by the infancy of whose reign we are detained from\r\ncoming to you.”[96] Of his death he writes[97] thus to Offa king of\r\nthe Mercians: “Your esteemed kindness is to understand that my lord,\r\nking Charles, often speaks to me of you with affection and sincerity,\r\nand in him you have the firmest friend. He therefore sends becoming\r\npresents to your love, and to the several sees of your kingdom. In\r\nlike manner he had appointed presents for king Ethelred, and for the\r\nsees of his bishops, but, oh, dreadful to think, at the very moment of\r\ndespatching these gifts and letters there came a sorrowful account, by\r\nthe ambassadors who returned out of Scotland through your country, of\r\nthe faithlessness of the people, and the death of the king. So that\r\nCharles, withholding his liberal gifts, is so highly incensed against\r\nthat nation as to call it perfidious and perverse, and the murderer of\r\nits sovereigns, esteeming it worse than pagan; and had I not interceded\r\nhe would have already deprived them of every advantage within his\r\nreach, and have done them all the injury in his power.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 796-827.] KING EGBERT.]\r\n\r\nAfter Ethelred no one durst ascend the throne;[98] each dreading the\r\nfate of his predecessor, and preferring a life of safety in inglorious\r\nease, to a tottering reign in anxious suspense: for most of the\r\nNorthumbrian kings had ended their reigns by a death which was now\r\nbecome almost habitual. Thus being without a sovereign for thirty-three\r\nyears, that province became an object of plunder and contempt to its\r\nneighbours. For when the Danes, who, as I have before related from\r\nthe words of Alcuin, laid waste the holy places, on their return home\r\nrepresented to their countrymen the fruitfulness of the island, and\r\nthe indolence of its inhabitants; these barbarians came over hastily,\r\nin great numbers, and obtained forcible possession of that part of\r\nthe country, till the time we are speaking of: indeed they had a\r\nking of their own for many years, though he was subordinate to the\r\nauthority of the king of the West Saxons. However, after the lapse\r\nof these thirty-three years, king Egbert obtained the sovereignty of\r\nthis province, as well as of the others, in the year of our Lord’s\r\nincarnation 827, and the twenty-eighth of his reign. And since we have\r\nreached his times, mindful of our engagement, we shall speak briefly\r\nof the kingdom of the Mercians; and this, as well because we admire\r\nbrevity in relation, as that there is no great abundance of materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\n_Of the kings of the Mercians._ [A.D. 626-874.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord’s incarnation 626, and the hundred and\r\nthirty-ninth after the death of Hengist, Penda the son of Pybba,\r\ntenth in descent of Woden, of noble lineage, expert in war, but at\r\nthe same time an irreligious heathen, at the age of fifty assumed the\r\ntitle[99] of king of the Mercians, after he had already fostered his\r\npresumption by frequent incursions on his neighbours. Seizing the\r\nsovereignty, therefore, with a mind loathing quiet and unconscious how\r\ngreat an enormity it was even to be victorious in a contest against\r\nhis own countrymen, he began to attack the neighbouring cities, to\r\ninvade the confines of the surrounding kings, and to fill everything\r\nwith terror and confusion. For what would not that man attempt, who,\r\nby his lawless daring, had extinguished those luminaries of Britain,\r\nEdwin and Oswald, kings of the Northumbrians, Sigebert, Ecgric, and\r\nAnna, kings of the East Angles; men, in whom nobility of race was\r\nequalled by sanctity of life? Kenwalk also, king of the West Saxons,\r\nafter being frequently harassed by him, was driven into exile; though,\r\nperhaps, he deservedly paid the penalty of his perfidy towards God,\r\nin denying his faith; and towards Penda himself, in repudiating his\r\nsister. It is irksome to relate, how eagerly he watched opportunities\r\nof slaughter, and as a raven flies greedily at the scent of a carcase,\r\nso he joined Cadwalla,[100] and was of infinite service to him, in\r\nrecovering his dominions. In this manner, for thirty years, he attacked\r\nhis countrymen, but did nothing worthy of record against strangers. His\r\ninsatiable desires, however, at last found an end suitable to their\r\ndeserts; for being routed, with his allies, by Oswy, who had succeeded\r\nhis brother Oswald, more through the assistance of God than his\r\nmilitary powers, Penda increased the number of infernal spirits. By his\r\nqueen Kyneswith his sons were Peada, Wulfhere, Ethelred, Merwal, and\r\nMercelin: his daughters, Kyneburg, and Kyneswith; both distinguished\r\nfor inviolable chastity. Thus the parent, though ever rebellious\r\ntowards God, produced a most holy offspring for Heaven.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 655-661.] PEADA--WULFHERE.]\r\n\r\nHis son Peada succeeded him in a portion of the kingdom, by the\r\npermission of Oswy, advanced to the government of the South Mercians;\r\na young man of talents, and even in his father’s lifetime son-in-law\r\nto Oswy. For he had received his daughter, on condition of renouncing\r\npaganism and embracing Christianity; in which faith he would soon have\r\ncaused the province of participate, the peaceful state of the kingdom\r\nand his father-in-law’s consent tending to such a purpose, had not his\r\ndeath, hastened, as they say, by the intrigues of his wife, intercepted\r\nthese joyful prospects. Then Oswy resumed the government, which seemed\r\nrightly to appertain to him from his victory over the father, and\r\nfrom his affinity to the son. The spirit, however, of the inhabitants\r\ncould not brook his authority more than three years; for they expelled\r\nhis generals, and Wulfhere, the son of Penda, being hailed as his\r\nsuccessor, the province recovered its liberty.\r\n\r\nWulfhere, that he might not disappoint the hopes of the nation, began\r\nto act with energy, to show himself an efficient prince by great\r\nexertions both mental and personal, and finally to afford Christianity,\r\nintroduced by his brother and yet hardly breathing in his kingdom,\r\nevery possible assistance. In the early years of his reign he was\r\nheavily oppressed by the king of the West Saxons, but in succeeding\r\ntimes, repelling the injury by the energy of his measures, he deprived\r\nhim of the sovereignty of the Isle of Wight; and leading it, yet\r\npanting after heathen rites, into the proper path, he soon after\r\nbestowed it on his godson, Ethelwalch, king of the South Saxons, as a\r\nrecompence for his faith. But these and all his other good qualities\r\nare stained and deteriorated by the dreadful brand of simony; because\r\nhe, first of the kings of the Angles, sold the sacred bishopric of\r\nLondon to one Wini, an ambitious man. His wife was Ermenhilda, the\r\ndaughter of Erconbert, king of Kent, of whom he begat Kinred, and\r\nWereburga, a most holy virgin who lies buried at Chester. His brother\r\nMerewald married Ermenburga, the daughter of Ermenred, brother of the\r\nsame Erconbert; by her he had issue, three daughters; Milburga, who\r\nlies at Weneloch; Mildritha in Kent, in the monastery of St. Augustine;\r\nand Milgitha: and one son, Merefin. Alfrid king of the Northumbrians\r\nmarried Kyneburg, daughter of Penda: who, after a time, disgusted with\r\nwedlock, took the habit of a nun in the monastery which her brothers,\r\nWulfhere and Ethelred, had founded.\r\n\r\nWulfhere died at the end of nineteen years, and his brother Ethelred\r\nascended the throne; more famed for his pious disposition than his\r\nskill in war. Moreover he was satisfied with displaying his valour\r\nin a single but illustrious expedition into Kent, and passed the\r\nremainder of his life in quiet, except that attacking Egfrid, king of\r\nthe Northumbrians, who had passed beyond the limits of his kingdom, he\r\nadmonished him to return home, by the murder of his brother Elfwin.\r\nHe atoned however for this slaughter, after due deliberation, at the\r\ninstance of St. Theodore, the archbishop, by giving Egfrid a large\r\nsum of money.[101] Subsequently to this, in the thirtieth year of\r\nhis reign, he took the cowl, and became a monk at Bardney, of which\r\nmonastery he was ultimately promoted to be abbat. This is the same\r\nperson who was contemporary with Ina, king of the West Saxons, and\r\nconfirmed by his authority also the privilege which St. Aldhelm brought\r\nfrom Rome. His wife was Ostritha, sister of Egfrid, king of the\r\nNorthumbrians, by whom she had issue a son named Ceolred.\r\n\r\nHe appointed Kenred, the son of his brother Wulfhere his successor,\r\nwho, equally celebrated for piety to God and uprightness towards\r\nhis subjects, ran his mortal race with great purity of manners, and\r\nproceeding to Rome in the fifth year of his reign, passed the remainder\r\nof his life there in the offices of religion; chiefly instigated\r\nto this by the melancholy departure of a soldier, who, as Bede\r\nrelates,[102] disdaining to confess his crimes when in health, saw,\r\nmanifestly, when at the point of death, those very demons coming to\r\npunish him to whose vicious allurements he had surrendered his soul.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 709-756.] BONIFACE’S EPISTLE.]\r\n\r\nAfter him reigned Ceolred, the son of Ethelred his uncle, as\r\nconspicuous for his valour against Ina, as pitiable for an early death;\r\nfor not filling the throne more than eight years, he was buried at\r\nLichfield, leaving Ethelbald, the grand-nephew of Penda by his brother\r\nAlwy, his heir. This king, enjoying the sovereignty in profound and\r\nlong-continued peace, that is, for the space of forty-one years, was\r\nultimately killed by his subjects, and thus met with a reverse of\r\nfortune. Bernred, the author of his death, left nothing worthy of\r\nrecord, except that afterwards, being himself put to death by Offa,\r\nhe received the just reward of his treachery. To this Ethelbald,\r\nBoniface,[103] archbishop of Mentz, an Angle by nation, who was\r\nsubsequently crowned with martyrdom, sent an epistle, part of which I\r\nshall transcribe, that it may appear how freely he asserts those very\r\nvices to have already gained ground among the Angles of which Alcuin in\r\nafter times was apprehensive. It will also be a strong proof, by the\r\nremarkable deaths of certain kings, how severely God punishes those\r\nguilty persons for whom his long-suspended anger mercifully waits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 756.] BONIFACE’S EPISTLE.]\r\n\r\n[104]“_To Ethelbald, my dearest lord, and to be preferred to all other\r\nkings of the Angles, in the love of Christ, Boniface the archbishop,\r\nlegate to Germany from the church of Rome, wisheth perpetual health in\r\nChrist._ We confess before God that when we hear of your prosperity,\r\nyour faith, and good works, we rejoice; and if at any time we hear\r\nof any adversity befallen you, either in the chance of war or the\r\njeopardy of your soul, we are afflicted. We have heard that, devoted\r\nto almsgiving, you prohibit theft and rapine, are a lover of peace, a\r\ndefender of widows, and of the poor; and for this we give God thanks.\r\nYour contempt for lawful matrimony, were it for chastity’s sake, would\r\nbe laudable; but since you wallow in luxury and even in adultery with\r\nnuns, it is disgraceful and damnable; it dims the brightness of your\r\nglory before God and man, and transforms you into an idolater, because\r\nyou have polluted the temple of God. Wherefore, my beloved son, repent,\r\nand remember how dishonourable it is, that you, who, by the grant of\r\nGod, are sovereign over many nations, should yourself be the slave of\r\nlust to his disservice. Moreover, we have heard that almost all the\r\nnobles of the Mercian kingdom, following your example, desert their\r\nlawful wives and live in guilty intercourse with adultresses and nuns.\r\nLet the custom of a foreign country teach you how far distant this\r\nis from rectitude. For in old Saxony, where there is no knowledge of\r\nChrist, if a virgin in her father’s house, or a married woman under\r\nthe protection of her husband, should be guilty of adultery, they\r\nburn her, strangled by her own hand, and hang up her seducer over the\r\ngrave where she is buried; or else, cutting off her garments to the\r\nwaist, modest matrons whip her and pierce her with knives, and fresh\r\ntormentors punish her in the same manner as she goes from town to town,\r\ntill they destroy her. Again the Winedi,[105] the basest of nations,\r\nhave this custom--the wife, on the death of her husband, casts herself\r\non the same funeral pile to be consumed with him. If then the gentiles,\r\nwho know not God, have so zealous a regard for chastity, how much more\r\nought you to possess, my beloved son, who are both a Christian and\r\na king? Spare therefore your own soul, spare a multitude of people,\r\nperishing by your example, for whose souls you must give account. Give\r\nheed to this too, if the nation of the Angles, (and we are reproached\r\nin France and in Italy and by the very pagans for it,) despising\r\nlawful matrimony, give free indulgence to adultery, a race ignoble and\r\ndespising God must necessarily proceed from such a mixture, which will\r\ndestroy the country by their abandoned manners, as was the case with\r\nthe Burgundians, Provençals, and Spaniards, whom the Saracens harassed\r\nfor many years on account of their past transgressions. Moreover, it\r\nhas been told us, that you take away from the churches and monasteries\r\nmany of their privileges, and excite, by your example, your nobility\r\nto do the like. But recollect, I entreat you, what terrible vengeance\r\nGod hath inflicted upon former kings, guilty of the crime we lay to\r\nyour charge. For Ceolred, your predecessor, the debaucher of nuns, the\r\ninfringer of ecclesiastical privileges, was seized, while splendidly\r\nregaling with his nobles, by a malignant spirit, who snatched away his\r\nsoul without confession and without communion, while in converse with\r\nthe devil and despising the law of God. He drove Osred also, king of\r\nthe Deirans and Bernicians, who was guilty of the same crimes, to such\r\nexcess that he lost his kingdom and perished in early manhood by an\r\nignominious death. Charles also, governor of the Franks, the subverter\r\nof many monasteries and the appropriator of ecclesiastical revenues to\r\nhis own use, perished by excruciating pain and a fearful death.” And\r\nafterwards, “Wherefore, my beloved son, we entreat with paternal and\r\nfervent prayers that you would not despise the counsel of your fathers,\r\nwho, for the love of God, anxiously appeal to your highness. For\r\nnothing is more salutary to a good king than the willing correction of\r\nsuch crimes when they are pointed out to him; since Solomon says ‘Whoso\r\nloveth instruction, loveth wisdom.’ Wherefore, my dearest son, showing\r\nyou good counsel, we call you to witness, and entreat you by the living\r\nGod, and his Son Jesus Christ, and by the Holy Spirit, that you would\r\nrecollect how fleeting is the present life, how short and momentary\r\nis the delight of the filthy flesh, and how ignominious for a person\r\nof transitory existence to leave a bad example to posterity. Begin\r\ntherefore to regulate your life by better habits, and correct the past\r\nerrors of your youth, that you may have praise before men here, and be\r\nblest with eternal glory hereafter. We wish your Highness health and\r\nproficiency in virtue.”\r\n\r\nI have inserted in my narrative portions of this epistle, to give\r\nsufficient knowledge of these circumstances, partly in the words of the\r\nauthor and partly in my own, shortening the sentences as seemed proper,\r\nfor which I shall easily be excused, because there was need of brevity\r\nfor the sake of those who were eager to resume the thread of the\r\nhistory. Moreover, Boniface transmitted an epistle of like import to\r\narchbishop Cuthbert, adding that he should remonstrate with the clergy\r\nand nuns on the fineness and vanity of their dress. Besides, that he\r\nmight not wonder at his interfering in that in which he had no apparent\r\nconcern, that is to say, how or with what manners the nation of the\r\nAngles conducted itself, he gave him to understand, that he had bound\r\nhimself by oath to pope Gregory the Third, not to conceal the conduct\r\nof the nations near him from the knowledge of the apostolical see;\r\nwherefore, if mild measures failed of success, he should take care to\r\nact in such manner, that vices of this kind should not be kept secret\r\nfrom the pope. Indeed, on account of the fine texture of the clerical\r\nvestments, Alcuin obliquely glances at Athelard the archbishop,\r\nCuthbert’s successor, reminding him that, when he should come to Rome\r\nto visit the emperor Charles the Great, the grandson of Charles of whom\r\nBoniface was speaking above, he should not bring the clergy or monks\r\ndressed in party-coloured or gaudy garments, for the clergy amongst the\r\nFranks dressed only in ecclesiastical habits.\r\n\r\nNor could the letters of so great a man, which he was accustomed\r\nto send from watchful regard to his legation and pure love of his\r\ncountry, be without effect. For both Cuthbert, the archbishop, and\r\nking Ethelbald summoned a council for the purpose of retrenching the\r\nsuperfluities which he had stigmatised. The acts of this synod, veiled\r\nin a multiplicity of words, I shall forbear to add, as I think they\r\nwill better accord with another part of my work, when I come to the\r\nsuccession of the bishops: but as I am now on the subject of kingly\r\naffairs, I shall subjoin a charter of Ethelbald’s, as a proof of his\r\ndevotion, because it took place in the same council.\r\n\r\n“It often happens, through the uncertain change of times, that those\r\nthings which have been confirmed by the testimony and advice of many\r\nfaithful persons, have been made of none effect by the contumacy\r\nof very many, or by the artifices of deceit, without any regard to\r\njustice, unless they have been committed to eternal memory by the\r\nauthority of writing and the testimony of charters. Wherefore I\r\nEthelbald, king of the Mercians, out of love to heaven and regard for\r\nmy own soul, have felt the necessity of considering how I may, by good\r\nworks, set it free from every tie of sin. For since the Omnipotent God,\r\nthrough the greatness of his clemency, without any previous merit on\r\nmy part, hath bestowed on me the sceptre of government, therefore I\r\nwillingly repay him out of that which he hath given. On this account\r\nI grant, so long as I live, that all monasteries and churches of my\r\nkingdom shall be exempted from public taxes, works, and impositions,\r\nexcept the building of forts and bridges, from which none can be\r\nreleased. And moreover the servants of God shall have perfect liberty\r\nin the produce of their woods and lands, and the right of fishing, nor\r\nshall they bring presents either to king or princes except voluntarily,\r\nbut they shall serve God without molestation.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 749-777.] LULLUS--OFFA.]\r\n\r\nLullus[106] succeeded Boniface, an Englishman by birth also; of whose\r\nsanctity mention is made in the life of St. Goar, and these verses,\r\nwhich I remember to have heard from my earliest childhood, bear witness:\r\n\r\n “Lullus, than whom no holier prelate lives,\r\n  By God’s assistance healing medicine gives,\r\n  Cures each disorder by his powerful hand,\r\n  And with his glory overspreads the land.”\r\n\r\nHowever, to return to my history, Offa, descended from Penda in the\r\nfifth degree, succeeded Ethelbald. He was a man of great mind, and one\r\nwho endeavoured to bring to effect whatever he had preconceived; he\r\nreigned thirty-nine years. When I consider the deeds of this person, I\r\nam doubtful whether I should commend or censure. At one time, in the\r\nsame character, vices were so palliated by virtues, and at another\r\nvirtues came in such quick succession upon vices that it is difficult\r\nto determine how to characterize the changing Proteus. My narrative\r\nshall give examples of each. Engaging in a set battle with Cynewulf,\r\nking of the West Saxons, he easily gained the victory, though the\r\nother was a celebrated warrior. When he thought artifice would better\r\nsuit his purpose, this same man beheaded king Ethelbert, who had come\r\nto him through the allurement of great promises, and was at that very\r\ntime within the walls of his palace, soothed into security by his\r\nperfidious attentions, and then unjustly seized upon the kingdom of the\r\nEast Angles which Ethelbert had held.\r\n\r\nThe relics of St. Alban, at that time obscurely buried, he ordered\r\nto be reverently taken up and placed in a shrine, decorated to the\r\nfullest extent of royal munificence, with gold and jewels; a church\r\nof most beautiful workmanship was there erected, and a society of\r\nmonks assembled. Yet rebellious against God, he endeavoured to remove\r\nthe archiepiscopal see formerly settled at Canterbury, to Lichfield,\r\nenvying, forsooth, the men of Kent the dignity of the archbishopric:\r\non which account he at last deprived Lambert, the archbishop, worn\r\nout with continual exertion, and who produced many edicts of the\r\napostolical see, both ancient and modern, of all possessions within\r\nhis territories, as well as of the jurisdiction over the bishoprics.\r\nFrom pope Adrian, therefore, whom he had wearied with plausible\r\nassertions for a long time, as many things not to be granted may\r\nbe gradually drawn and artfully wrested from minds intent on other\r\noccupations, he obtained that there should be an archbishopric of the\r\nMercians at Lichfield, and that all the prelates of the Mercians should\r\nbe subject to that province. Their names were as follow: Denebert,\r\nbishop of Worcester, Werenbert, of Leicester, Edulph, of Sidnacester,\r\nWulpheard, of Hereford; and the bishops of the East Angles, Alpheard,\r\nof Elmham, Tidfrid, of Dunwich; the bishop of Lichfield was named\r\nAldulph. Four bishops however remained suffragan to Lambert, archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, London, Winchester, Rochester, and Selsey. Some of\r\nthese bishoprics are now in being, some are removed to other places,\r\nothers consolidated by venal interest, for Leicester, Sidnacester, and\r\nDunwich, from some unknown cause, are no longer in existence. Nor did\r\nOffa’s rapacity stop here, for he showed himself a downright public\r\npilferer, by converting to his own use the lands of many churches,\r\nof which Malmesbury was one. But this iniquity did not long deform\r\ncanonical institutions, for soon after Kenulf, Offa’s successor,\r\ninferior to no preceding king in power or in faith, transmitted a\r\nletter to Leo, the successor of Adrian, and restored Athelard who had\r\nsucceeded Lambert, to his former dignity. Hence Alcuin, in an epistle\r\nto the same Athelard, says “Having heard of the success of your\r\njourney, and your return to your country, and how you were received by\r\nthe pope, I give thanks with every sentiment of my heart to the Lord\r\nour God, who, by the precious gift of his mercy, directed your way\r\nwith a prosperous progress, gave you favour in the sight of the pope,\r\ngranted you to return home with the perfect accomplishment of your\r\nwishes, and hath condescended, through you, to restore the holiest seat\r\nof our first teacher to its pristine dignity.” I think it proper to\r\nsubjoin part of the king’s epistle and also of the pope’s, though I may\r\nseem by so doing to anticipate the regular order of time; but I shall\r\ndo it on this account, that it is a task of greater difficulty to blend\r\ntogether disjointed facts than to despatch those I had begun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 790.] KENULF’S EPISTLE.]\r\n\r\n“_To the most holy and truly loving lord Leo, pontiff of the sacred and\r\napostolical see, Kenulf, by the grace of God king of the Mercians, with\r\nthe bishops, princes, and every degree of dignity under our authority,\r\nsendeth the salutation of the purest love in Christ._\r\n\r\n“We give thanks ever to God Almighty, who is wont, by the means of\r\nnew guides, the former being taken to the life eternal, to guide the\r\nchurch, purchased by his precious blood, amid the diverse storms of\r\nthis world, to the haven of salvation, and to shed fresh light upon\r\nit, in order that it be led into no error of darkness, but may pursue\r\nthe path of truth without stumbling; wherefore the universal church\r\njustly rejoices, that when the true rewarder of all good men took the\r\nmost glorious pastor of his flock, Adrian, to be eternally rewarded in\r\nheaven, still his kind providence gave a shepherd to his flock, not\r\nless skilled, to conduct the sheep of God into the fold of life. We\r\nalso, who live on the farthest confines of the world, justly boast,\r\nbeyond all other things, that the church’s exaltation is our safety,\r\nits prosperity our constant ground of joy; since your apostolical\r\ndignity and our true faith originate from the same source. Whentfore\r\nI deem it fitting to incline the ear of our obedience, with all due\r\nhumility, to your holy commands, and to fulfil, with every possible\r\nendeavour, what shall seem just to your piety for us to accomplish:\r\nbut to avoid, and utterly reject, all that shall be found inconsistent\r\nwith right. But now, I, Kenulf, by the grace of God king, humbly\r\nentreat your excellence that I may address you as I wish, without\r\noffence, on the subject of our progress, that you may receive me\r\nwith peaceful tranquillity into the bosom of your piety, and that\r\nthe liberal bounty of your benediction may qualify me, gifted with\r\nno stock of merit, to rule my people; in order that God may deign,\r\nthrough your intercession, to defend the nation, which, together with\r\nme, your apostolical authority has instructed in the rudiments of the\r\nfaith, against all attacks of adversaries, and to extend that kingdom\r\nwhich he hath given. This benediction all the Mercian kings before me\r\nwere, by your predecessors, deemed worthy to obtain. This, I humbly\r\nbeg, and this, O most holy man, I desire to receive, that you would\r\nmore especially accept me as a son by adoption, as I love you as my\r\nfather, and always honour you with all possible obedience. For among\r\nsuch great personages faith ever should be kept inviolate, as well as\r\nperfect love, because paternal love is to be looked upon as filial\r\nhappiness in God, according to the saying of Hezekiah, ‘A father will\r\nmake known thy truth to his sons, O Lord.’ In which words I implore\r\nyou, O loved father, not to deny to your unworthy son the knowledge of\r\nthe Lord in your holy words, in order that, by your sound instruction,\r\nI may deserve, by the assistance of God, to come to a better course of\r\nlife. And moreover, O most affectionate father, we beg, with all our\r\nbishops, and every person of rank among us, that, concerning the many\r\ninquiries on which we have thought it right to consult your wisdom,\r\nyou would courteously reply, lest the traditions of the holy fathers\r\nand their instructions should, through ignorance, be misunderstood by\r\nus; but let your reply reach us in charity and meekness, that, through\r\nthe mercy of God, it may bring forth fruit in us. The first thing our\r\nbishops and learned men allege is, that, contrary to the canons and\r\npapal constitutions enacted for our use by the direction of the most\r\nholy father Gregory, as you know, the jurisdiction of the metropolitan\r\nof Canterbury is divided into two provinces, to whose power, by the\r\nsame father’s command, twelve bishops ought to be subject, as is read\r\nthroughout our churches, in the letter which he directed to his brother\r\nand fellow bishop, Augustine, concerning the two metropolitans of\r\nLondon and York, which letter doubtlessly you also possess. But that\r\npontifical dignity, which was at that time destined to London, with\r\nthe honour and distinction of the pall, was, for his sake, removed\r\nand granted to Canterbury. For since Augustine, of blessed memory,\r\nwho, at the command of St. Gregory, preached the word of God to the\r\nnation of the Angles, and so gloriously presided over the church of the\r\nSaxons, died in that city, and his body was buried in the church of\r\nSt. Peter, the chief of apostles, which his successor St. Laurentius\r\nconsecrated, it seemed proper to the sages of our nation, that the\r\nmetropolitan dignity should reside in that city where rests the body of\r\nthe man who planted the true faith in these parts. The honour of this\r\npre-eminence, as you know, king Offa first attempted to take away and\r\nto divide it into two provinces, through enmity against the venerable\r\nLambert and the Kentish people; and your pious brother and predecessor,\r\nAdrian, at the request of the aforesaid king, first did what no one\r\nhad before presumed, and honoured the prelate of the Mercians with the\r\npall. But yet we blame neither of these persons, whom, as we believe,\r\nChrist crowns with eternal glory. Nevertheless we humbly entreat your\r\nexcellence, on whom God hath deservedly conferred the key of wisdom,\r\nthat you would consult with your counsellors on this subject, and\r\ncondescend to transmit to us what may be necessary for us to observe\r\nhereafter, and what may tend to the unity of real peace, as we wish,\r\nthrough your sound doctrine, lest the coat of Christ, woven throughout\r\nwithout seam, should suffer any rent among us. We have written this\r\nto you, most holy father, with equal humility and regard, earnestly\r\nentreating your clemency, that you would kindly and justly reply to\r\nthose things which have been of necessity submitted to you. Moreover we\r\nwish that you would examine, with pious love, that epistle which, in\r\nthe presence of all our bishops, Athelard the archbishop wrote to you\r\nmore fully on the subject of his own affairs and necessities, as well\r\nas on those of all Britain; that whatever the rule of faith requires in\r\nthose matters which are contained therein, you would condescend truly\r\nto explain. Wherefore last year I sent my own embassy, and that of the\r\nbishops by Wada the abbat, which he received, but idly and foolishly\r\nexecuted. I now send you a small present as a token of regard,\r\nrespected father, by Birine the priest, and Fildas and Ceolbert,\r\nmy servants, that is to say, one hundred and twenty mancuses,[107]\r\ntogether with letters, begging that you would condescend to receive\r\nthem kindly, and give us your blessing. May God Almighty long preserve\r\nyou safe to the glory of his holy church.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 787.] POPE LEO’S EPISTLE.]\r\n\r\n“_To the most excellent prince, my son Kenulf, king of the Mercians, of\r\nthe province of the Saxons, pope Leo sendeth greeting._ Our most holy\r\nand reverend brother Athelard, archbishop of Canterbury, arriving at\r\nthe holy churches of the blessed apostles Peter and Paul, as well for\r\nthe faithful performance of his vow of prayer as to acquaint us with\r\nthe cause of his ecclesiastical mission to the apostolical see, hath\r\nbrought to us the enclosures of your royal excellence, where finding,\r\nin two epistles filled with true faith, your great humility, we return\r\nthanks to Almighty God, who hath taught and inclined your most prudent\r\nexcellence to have due regard with us in all things towards St. Peter,\r\nthe chief of apostles, and to submit with meekness to all apostolical\r\nconstitutions. Moreover, in one of these epistles we find that, were\r\nit requisite, you would even lay down your life for us, for the sake\r\nof our apostolical office. And again, you confess that you rejoice\r\nmuch in the Lord at our prosperity, and that when these our letters of\r\nkindest admonition reach the ears of your cordiality, you will receive\r\nthem with all humility and spiritual joy of heart, as sons do the gift\r\nof a father. It is added too that you had ordered a small present\r\nout of your abundance to be offered to us, an hundred and twenty\r\nmancuses, which, with ardent desire for the salvation of your soul,\r\nwe have accepted. The aforesaid archbishop, with his attendants, has\r\nbeen honourably and kindly received by us, and has been rendered every\r\nnecessary assistance. In the meantime, trusting to your most prudent\r\nexcellence when you observe, even in your own royal letters, that no\r\nChristian can presume to run counter to our apostolical decisions,\r\nwe therefore endeavour, with all possible diligence, to transmit and\r\nordain what shall be of service to your kingdom, that as a canonical\r\ncensure enjoins your royal excellence, and all the princes of your\r\nnation, and the whole people of God, to observe all things which the\r\naforesaid archbishop Athelard our brother, or the whole body of the\r\nevangelical and apostolical doctrine and that of the holy fathers and\r\nof our predecessors the holy pontiffs ordain, you ought by no means to\r\nresist their orthodox doctrine in any thing, as our Lord and Saviour\r\nsays in the Gospel, “He who receiveth you receiveth me,” and “he who\r\nreceives a prophet, in the name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet’s\r\nreward.” And how much more do we praise the Almighty for this same lord\r\narchbishop, whom you have so highly commended to us as being, what\r\nhe really is, honourable, and skilful, and prudent, of good morals,\r\nworthy before God and men. O loving son and excellent king, we praise\r\nGod, that hath pointed out to you a prelate who, like a true shepherd,\r\nis able to prescribe due penance, according to the doctrine of the\r\nholy Scriptures, and to rescue the souls of those who are under his\r\nsacerdotal authority from the nethermost hell, snatching them from\r\ninextinguishable fire, bringing them into the haven of salvation, and\r\noffering for them to God Almighty a sacrifice, fit and pure in the\r\nsight of the Divine Majesty. And since the aforesaid archbishop hath\r\npleased us extremely in every respect, in all holiness and conversation\r\nof life, confiding much to him, we give him such prelatical power by\r\nthe authority of St. Peter, the chief of the apostles, whose office,\r\nthough unworthily, we fill, that if any in his province, as well\r\nkings and princes as people, shall transgress the commandments of the\r\nLord, he shall excommunicate him until he repent; and if he remain\r\nimpenitent, let him be to you as an heathen and a publican. But with\r\nrespect to the aforesaid Athelard, archbishop of Canterbury, since\r\nyour excellent prelates have demanded from us that we do him justice\r\nconcerning the jurisdiction which he lately held, as well of bishops\r\nas monasteries, and of which he has been unjustly deprived, as you\r\nknow, and which have been taken from his venerable see: we, making most\r\ndiligent search, have found in our sacred depository, that St. Gregory,\r\nour predecessor, delivered that diocese to his deputed archbishop St.\r\nAugustine, with the right of consecrating bishops, to the full number\r\nof twelve. Hence we also, having ascertained the truth, have, by our\r\napostolical authority, placed all ordinations or confirmations on their\r\nancient footing, and do restore them to him entire, and we deliver to\r\nhim the grant of our confirmation, to be duly observed by his church,\r\naccording to the sacred canons.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Offa, that the outrages against his countrymen might\r\nnot secretly tend to his disadvantage, in order to conciliate the\r\nfavour of neighbouring kings, gave his daughter Eadburga in marriage\r\nto Bertric, king of the West Saxons; and obtained the amity of Charles\r\nthe Great, king of the Franks, by repeated embassies, though he could\r\nfind little in the disposition of Charles to second his views. They\r\nhad disagreed before, insomuch that violent feuds having arisen on\r\nboth sides, even the intercourse of traders was prohibited. There is\r\nan epistle of Alcuin to this effect, part of which I shall subjoin, as\r\nit affords a strong proof of the magnanimity and valour of Charles,\r\nwho spent all his time in war against the Pagans, rebels to God. He\r\nsays,[108] “The ancient Saxons and all the Friesland nations were\r\nconverted to the faith of Christ through the exertions of king Charles,\r\nurging some with threats, and others with rewards. At the end of the\r\nyear the king made an attack upon the Sclavonians and subjugated them\r\nto his power. The Avares, whom we call Huns, made a furious attempt\r\nupon Italy, but were conquered by the generals of the aforesaid most\r\nChristian king, and returned home with disgrace. In like manner they\r\nrushed against Bavaria, and were again overcome and dispersed by the\r\nChristian army. Moreover the princes and commanders of the same most\r\nChristian king took great part of Spain from the Saracens, to the\r\nextent of three hundred miles along the sea-coast: but, O shame! these\r\naccursed Saracens, who are the Hagarens, have dominion over the whole\r\nof Africa, and the larger part of Asia Major. I know not what will be\r\nour destination, for some ground of difference, fomented by the devil,\r\nhas arisen between king Charles and king Offa, so that, on both sides,\r\nall navigation is prohibited the merchants. Some say that we are to be\r\nsent into those parts to treat of peace.”\r\n\r\nIn these words, in addition to what I have remarked above, any\r\ncurious person may determine how many years have elapsed since the\r\nSaracens invaded Africa and Asia Major. And indeed, had not the mercy\r\nof God animated the native spirit of the emperors of the Franks,\r\nthe pagans had long since subjugated Europe also. For, holding the\r\nConstantinopolitan emperors in contempt, they possessed themselves of\r\nSicily and Sardinia, the Balearic isles, and almost all the countries\r\nsurrounded by the sea, with the exception of Crete, Rhodes, and Cyprus.\r\nIn our time however they have been compelled to relinquish Sicily by\r\nthe Normans, Corsica and Sardinia by the Pisans, and great part of\r\nAsia and Jerusalem itself by the Franks and other nations of Europe.\r\nBut, as I shall have a fitter place to treat largely of these matters\r\nhereafter, I shall now subjoin, from the words of Charles himself, the\r\ntreaty which was ratified between him and Offa king of the Mercians.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 787.] EPISTLE OF CHARLEMAGNE.]\r\n\r\n“_Charles, by the grace of God king of the Franks and Lombards, and\r\npatrician of the Romans, to his esteemed and dearest brother Offa\r\nking of the Mercians, sendeth health_:--First, we give thanks to God\r\nAlmighty for the purity of the Catholic faith, which we find laudably\r\nexpressed in your letters. Concerning pilgrims, who for the love of\r\nGod or the salvation of their souls, wish to visit the residence of\r\nthe holy apostles, let them go peaceably without any molestation; but\r\nif persons, not seeking the cause of religion, but that of gain, be\r\nfound amongst them, let them pay the customary tolls in proper places.\r\nWe will, too, that traders have due protection within our kingdom,\r\naccording to our mandate, and if in any place they suffer wrongful\r\noppression, let them appeal to us or to our judges, and we will see\r\nfull justice done. Let your kindness also be apprized that we have sent\r\nsome token of our regard, out of our dalmatics[109] and palls, to each\r\nepiscopal see of your kingdom or of Ethelred’s, as an almsgiving, on\r\naccount of our apostolical lord Adrian, earnestly begging that you\r\nwould order him to be prayed for, not as doubting that his blessed soul\r\nis at rest, but to show our esteem and regard to our dearest friend.\r\nMoreover we have sent somewhat out of the treasure of those earthly\r\nriches, which the Lord Jesus hath granted to us of his unmerited\r\nbounty, for the metropolitan cities, and for yourself a belt, an\r\nHungarian sword, and two silk cloaks.”\r\n\r\nI have inserted these brief extracts from the epistle that posterity\r\nmay be clearly acquainted with the friendship of Offa and Charles;\r\nconfiding in which friendly intercourse, although assailed by the\r\nhatred of numbers, he passed the rest of his life in uninterrupted\r\nquiet, and saw Egfert his son anointed to succeed him. This Egfert\r\nstudiously avoided the cruel path trod by his father, and devoutly\r\nrestored the privileges of all the churches which Offa had in his\r\ntime abridged. The possessions also which his father had taken from\r\nMalmesbury he restored into the hands of Cuthbert, then abbat of that\r\nplace, at the admonition of the aforesaid Athelard archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, a man of energy and a worthy servant of God, and who is\r\nuniformly asserted to have been its abbat before Cuthbert, from the\r\ncircumstance of his choosing there to be buried. But while the hopes\r\nof Egfert’s noble qualities were ripening, in the first moments of\r\nhis reign, untimely death cropped the flower of his youthful prime;\r\non which account Alcuin writing to the patrician Osbert, says, “I do\r\nnot think that the most noble youth Egfert died for his own sins, but\r\nbecause his father, in the establishment of his kingdom, shed a deluge\r\nof blood.” Dying after a reign of four months, he appointed Kenulf,\r\nnephew of Penda in the fifth degree by his brother Kenwalk, to succeed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nKenulf was a truly great man, and surpassed his fame by his virtues,\r\ndoing nothing that malice could justly find fault with. Religious at\r\nhome, victorious abroad, his praises will be deservedly extolled so\r\nlong as an impartial judge can be found in England. Equally to be\r\nadmired for the extent of his power and for the lowliness of his mind;\r\nof which he gave an eminent proof in restoring, as we have related, its\r\nfaltering dignity to Canterbury, he little regarded earthly grandeur in\r\nhis own kingdom at the expense of deviating from anciently-enjoined\r\ncanons. Taking up Offa’s hatred against the Kentish people, he sorely\r\nafflicted that province, and led away captive their king Eadbert,\r\nsurnamed Pren; but not long after, moved with sentiments of pity, he\r\nreleased him. For at Winchelcombe, where he had built a church to God,\r\nwhich yet remains, on the day of its dedication he freed the captive\r\nking at the altar, and consoled him with liberty; thereby giving a\r\nmemorable instance of his clemency. Cuthred,[110] whom he had made\r\nking over the Kentish people, was present to applaud this act of royal\r\nmunificence. The church resounded with acclamations, the street shook\r\nwith crowds of people, for in an assembly of thirteen bishops and ten\r\ndukes, no one was refused a largess, all departed with full purses.\r\nMoreover, in addition to those presents of inestimable price and number\r\nin utensils, clothes, and select horses, which the chief nobility\r\nreceived, he gave to all who did not possess landed property[111] a\r\npound of silver, to each presbyter a marca of gold, to every monk a\r\nshilling, and lastly he made many presents to the people at large.\r\nAfter he had endowed the monastery with such ample revenues as would\r\nseem incredible in the present time, he honoured it by his sepulture,\r\nin the twenty-fourth year of his reign. His son Kenelm, of tender age,\r\nand undeservedly murdered by his sister Quendrida, gained the title and\r\ndistinction of martyrdom, and rests in the same place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 796-825.] KENELM--WITHLAF.]\r\n\r\nAfter him the kingdom of the Mercians sank from its prosperity, and\r\nbecoming nearly lifeless, produced nothing worthy to be mentioned in\r\nhistory. However, that no one may accuse me of leaving the history\r\nimperfect, I shall glance over the names of the kings in succession.\r\nCeolwulf, the brother of Kenulf, reigning one year was expelled in the\r\nsecond by Bernulf; who in the third year of his reign being overcome\r\nand put to flight by Egbert, king of the West Saxons, was afterwards\r\nslain by the East Angles, because he had attempted to seize on East\r\nAnglia, as a kingdom subject to the Mercians from the time of Offa.\r\nLudecan, after a reign of two years, was despatched by these Angles,\r\nas he was preparing to avenge his predecessor: Withlaf, subjugated in\r\nthe commencement of his reign by the before-mentioned Egbert, governed\r\nthirteen years, paying tribute to him and to his son, both for his\r\nperson and his property: Berthwulf reigning thirteen years on the same\r\nconditions, was at last driven by the Danish pirates beyond the sea:\r\nBurhred marrying Ethelswith, the daughter of king Ethelwulf, the son\r\nof Egbert, exonerated himself, by this affinity, from the payment of\r\ntribute and the depredations of the enemy, but after twenty-two years,\r\ndriven by them from his country, he fled to Rome, and was there buried\r\nat the school of the Angles, in the church of St. Mary; his wife, at\r\nthat time continuing in this country, but afterwards following her\r\nhusband, died at Pavia. The kingdom was next given by the Danes to one\r\nCelwulf, an attendant of Burhred’s, who bound himself by oath that he\r\nwould retain it only at their pleasure: after a few years it fell under\r\nthe dominion of Alfred, the grandson of Egbert. Thus the sovereignty\r\nof the Mercians, which prematurely bloomed by the overweening ambition\r\nof an heathen, altogether withered away through the inactivity of a\r\ndriveller king, in the year of our Lord’s incarnation eight hundred and\r\nseventy-five.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n_Of the kings of the East Angles._ [A.D. 520-905.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 616-793.] EORPWALD--EDMUND.]\r\n\r\nAs my narrative has hitherto treated of the history of the four more\r\npowerful kingdoms in as copious a manner, I trust, as the perusal of\r\nancient writers has enabled me, I shall now, as last in point of order,\r\nrun through the governments of the East Angles and East Saxons, as\r\nsuggested in my preface. The kingdom of the East Angles arose anterior\r\nto the West Saxons, though posterior to the kingdom of Kent. The\r\nfirst[112] and also the greatest king of the East Angles was Redwald,\r\ntenth in descent from Woden as they affirm; for all the southern\r\nprovinces of the Angles and Saxons on this side of the river Humber,\r\nwith their kings, were subject to his authority. This is the person\r\nwhom I have formerly mentioned as having, out of regard for Edwin,\r\nkilled Ethelfrid, king of the Northumbrians. Through the persuasion of\r\nEdwin too he was baptized; and after, at the instigation of his wife,\r\nabjured the faith. His son, Eorpwald, embraced pure Christianity, and\r\npoured out his immaculate spirit to God, being barbarously murdered\r\nby the heathen Richbert. To him succeeded Sigebert, his brother by\r\nthe mother’s side, a worthy servant of the Lord, polished from all\r\nbarbarism by his education among the Franks. For, being driven into\r\nbanishment by Redwald, and for a long time associating with them, he\r\nhad received the rites of Christianity, which, on his coming into\r\npower he graciously communicated to the whole of his kingdom, and also\r\ninstituted schools of learning in different places. This ought highly\r\nto be extolled: as men heretofore uncivilized and irreligious, were\r\nenabled, by his means, to taste the sweets of literature. The promoter\r\nof his studies and the stimulator of his religion was Felix the bishop,\r\na Burgundian by birth, who now lies buried at Ramsey. Sigebert moreover\r\nrenouncing the world and taking the monastic vow, left the throne to\r\nhis relation, Ecgric, with whom, being attacked in intestine war by\r\nPenda, king of the Mercians, he met his death, at the moment when,\r\nsuperior to his misfortunes, and mindful of his religious profession,\r\nhe held only a wand in his hand. The successor of Ecgric was Anna, the\r\nson of Eni, the brother of Redwald, involved in similar destruction\r\nby the same furious Penda; he was blessed with a numerous and noble\r\noffspring, as the second book will declare in its proper place. To Anna\r\nsucceeded his brother Ethelhere, who was justly slain by Oswy king of\r\nthe Northumbrians, together with Penda, because he was an auxiliary\r\nto him, and was actually supporting the very army which had destroyed\r\nhis brother and his kinsman. His brother Ethelwald, in due succession,\r\nleft the kingdom to Adulf and Elwold, the sons of Ethelhere. Next came\r\nBernred. After him Ethelred. His son was St. Ethelbert, whom Offa king\r\nof the Mercians killed through treachery, as has already been said,\r\nand will be repeated hereafter. After him, through the violence of the\r\nMercians, few kings reigned in Eastern Anglia till the time of St.\r\nEdmund, and he was despatched in the sixteenth year of his reign, by\r\nHingwar, a heathen; from which time the Angles ceased to command in\r\ntheir own country for fifty years. For the province was nine years\r\nwithout a king, owing to the continued devastations of the pagans;\r\nafterwards both in it and in East Saxony, Gothrun, a Danish king,\r\nreigned for twelve years, in the time of king Alfred. Gothrun had\r\nfor successor a Dane also, by name Eohric, who, after he had reigned\r\nfourteen years, was taken off by the Angles, because he conducted\r\nhimself with cruelty towards them. Still, however, liberty beamed not\r\non this people, for the Danish earls continued to oppress them, or\r\nelse to excite them against the kings of the West Saxons, till Edward,\r\nthe son of Alfred, added both provinces to his own West Saxon empire,\r\nexpelling the Danes and freeing the Angles. This event took place in\r\nthe fiftieth year after the murder of St. Edmund, king and martyr, and\r\nin the fifteenth[113] of his own reign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n_Of the kings of the East Saxons._ [A.D. 520-823.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly co-eval with the kingdom of the East Angles, was that of the\r\nEast Saxons; which had many kings in succession, though subject\r\nto others, and principally to those of the Mercians. First, then,\r\nSleda,[114] the tenth from Woden, reigned over them; whose son, Sabert,\r\nnephew of St. Ethelbert, king of Kent, by his sister Ricula, embraced\r\nthe faith of Christ at the preaching of St. Mellitus, first bishop\r\nof London; for that city belongs to the East Saxons. On the death of\r\nSabert, his sons, Sexred and Seward, drove Mellitus into banishment,\r\nand soon after, being killed by the West Saxons, they paid the penalty\r\nof their persecution against Christ. Sigbert, surnamed the Small,\r\nthe son of Seward, succeeding, left the kingdom to Sigebert, the son\r\nof Sigebald, who was the brother of Sabert. This Sigebert, at the\r\nexhortation of king Oswy, was baptized in Northumbria by bishop Finan,\r\nand brought back to his nation, by the ministry of bishop Cedd,[115]\r\nthe faith which they had expelled together with Mellitus. After\r\ngloriously governing the kingdom, he left it in a manner still more\r\nglorious; for he was murdered by his near relations, merely because,\r\nin conformity to the gospel-precept, he used kindly to spare his\r\nenemies, nor regard with harsh and angry countenance, if they were\r\npenitent, those who had offended him. His brother Suidelm, baptized\r\nby the same Cedd in East Anglia, succeeded. On his death, Sighere,\r\nthe son of Sigbert the Small, and Sebbi, the son of Seward, held the\r\nsovereignty. Sebbi’s associate dying, he himself voluntarily retired\r\nfrom the kingdom in his thirtieth year, becoming a monk, as Bede\r\nrelates. His sons Sighard and of Sighere, governed the kingdom for a\r\nshort time; a youth of engaging countenance and disposition, in the\r\nflower of his age, and highly beloved by his subjects. He, through the\r\npersuasion of Kyneswith, daughter of king Penda, whom he had anxiously\r\nsought in marriage, being taught to aspire after heavenly affections,\r\nwent to Rome with Kenred king of the Mercians, and St. Edwin bishop of\r\nWorcester; and there taking the vow, in due time entered the heavenly\r\nmansions. To him succeeded Selred, son of Sigebert the Good, during\r\nthirty-eight years; who being slain, Swithed assumed the sovereignty of\r\nthe East Saxons;[116] but in the same year that Egbert king of the West\r\nSaxons subdued Kent, being expelled by him, he vacated the kingdom;\r\nthough London, with the adjacent country, continued subject to the\r\nkings of the Mercians as long as they held their sovereignty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 653-823.] OF THE KINGS OF KENT.]\r\n\r\nThe kings of Kent, it is observed, had dominion peculiarly in Kent, in\r\nwhich are two sees; the archbishopric of Canterbury, and the bishopric\r\nof Rochester.\r\n\r\nThe kings of the West Saxons ruled in Wiltshire, Berkshire, and\r\nDorsetshire; in which there is one bishop, whose see is now at Sarum\r\nor Salisbury; formerly it was at Ramsbury, or at Sherborne: in Sussex,\r\nwhich for some little time possessed a king of its own;[117] the\r\nepiscopal see of this county was anciently in the island of Selsey,\r\nas Bede relates, where St. Wilfrid built a monastery; the bishop now\r\ndwells at Chichester: in the counties of Southampton and Surrey; which\r\nhave a bishop, whose see is at Winchester: in the county of Somerset,\r\nwhich formerly had a bishop at Wells, but now at Bath: and in Domnonia,\r\nnow called Devonshire, and Cornubia, now Cornwall; at that time there\r\nwere two bishoprics, one at Crediton, the other at St. German’s; now\r\nthere is but one, and the see is at Exeter.\r\n\r\nThe kings of the Mercians governed the counties of Gloucester,\r\nWorcester, and Warwick; in these is one bishop whose residence is\r\nat Worcester: in Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire; these\r\nhave one bishop, who has part of Warwickshire and Shropshire; his\r\nresidence is at the city of Legions, that is Chester or Coventry;\r\nformerly it was at Lichfield: in Herefordshire; and there is a bishop\r\nhaving half Shropshire and part of Warwickshire, and Gloucestershire;\r\nwhose residence is at Hereford: in Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire,\r\nHertfordshire, Huntingdonshire, half of Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire,\r\nLeicestershire, Lincolnshire; which counties are under the jurisdiction\r\nof a bishop now resident at Lincoln, but formerly at Dorchester in the\r\ncounty of Oxford: in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire, which belong\r\nto the diocese of York; formerly they had their own bishop, whose seat\r\nwas at Leicester.\r\n\r\nThe kings of the East Angles had dominion over the county of Cambridge;\r\nthere is a bishop, whose seat is at Ely: and in Norfolk and Suffolk:\r\nwhose see is at Norwich; formerly at Elmham or Thetford.\r\n\r\nThe kings of the East Saxons ruled in Essex, in Middlesex, and half of\r\nHertfordshire; where there anciently was, and still remains, the bishop\r\nof London.\r\n\r\nThe kings of the Northumbrians governed all the country which is beyond\r\nthe river Humber, even into Scotland; and there were the archbishop\r\nof York, the bishops of Hexham, of Ripon, of Lindisfarne, and of\r\nCandida Casa [Whitherne]; Hexham and Ripon are no more; Lindisfarne is\r\ntranslated to Durham.\r\n\r\nSuch were the divisions of the kingdom of England, although the kings,\r\naccording to the vicissitude of the times, now one, and then the other,\r\nwould exceed their boundaries through their courage, or lose them by\r\ntheir indolence; but all these several kingdoms Egbert subjugated by\r\nhis abilities, and consolidated into one empire, reserving to each\r\ntheir own laws. Wherefore, since I have passed beyond his times,\r\nfulfilling my promise in a review of the different periods, I will\r\nhere fix the limits of my first volume, that the various tracks of the\r\ndifferent kingdoms may unite in the general path of the West Saxon\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 800.] PROLOGUE TO BOOK II.]\r\n\r\nA long period has elapsed since, as well through the care of my\r\nparents as my own industry, I became familiar with books. This\r\npleasure possessed me from my childhood: this source of delight has\r\ngrown with my years. Indeed I was so instructed by my father, that,\r\nhad I turned aside to other pursuits, I should have considered it as\r\njeopardy to my soul and discredit to my character. Wherefore mindful\r\nof the adage “covet what is necessary,” I constrained my early age\r\nto desire eagerly that which it was disgraceful not to possess. I\r\ngave, indeed, my attention to various branches of literature, but in\r\ndifferent degrees. Logic, for instance, which gives arms to eloquence,\r\nI contented myself with barely hearing. Medicine, which ministers to\r\nthe health of the body, I studied with somewhat more attention. But\r\nnow, having scrupulously examined the several branches of Ethics, I\r\nbow down to its majesty, because it spontaneously unveils itself to\r\nthose who study it, and directs their minds to moral practice; History\r\nmore especially; which, by an agreeable recapitulation of past events,\r\nexcites its readers, by example, to frame their lives to the pursuit\r\nof good, or to aversion from evil. When, therefore, at my own expense,\r\nI had procured some historians of foreign nations, I proceeded, during\r\nmy domestic leisure, to inquire if any thing concerning our own country\r\ncould be found worthy of handing down to posterity. Hence it arose,\r\nthat, not content with the writings of ancient times, I began, myself,\r\nto compose; not indeed to display my learning, which is comparatively\r\nnothing, but to bring to light events lying concealed in the confused\r\nmass of antiquity. In consequence rejecting vague opinions, I have\r\nstudiously sought for chronicles far and near, though I confess I have\r\nscarcely profited any thing by this industry. For perusing them all, I\r\nstill remained poor in information; though I ceased not my researches\r\nas long as I could find any thing to read. However, what I have clearly\r\nascertained concerning the four kingdoms, I have inserted in my first\r\nbook, in which I hope truth will find no cause to blush, though perhaps\r\na degree of doubt may sometimes arise. I shall now trace the monarchy\r\nof the West Saxon kingdom, through the line of successive princes,\r\ndown to the coming of the Normans: which if any person will condescend\r\nto regard with complacency, let him in brotherly love observe the\r\nfollowing rule: “If before, he knew only these things, let him not be\r\ndisgusted because I have inserted them; if he shall know more, let\r\nhim not be angry that I have not spoken of them;” but rather let him\r\ncommunicate his knowledge to me, while I yet live, that at least, those\r\nevents may appear in the margin of my history, which do not occur in\r\nthe text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\n_The history of king Egbert._ [A.D. 800-839.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 800-828.] OF KING EGBERT.]\r\n\r\nMy former volume terminated where the four kingdoms of Britain were\r\nconsolidated into one. Egbert, the founder of this sovereignty,\r\ngrand-nephew of king Ina, by his brother Ingild, of high rank in his\r\nown nation, and liberally educated, had been conspicuous among the\r\nWest Saxons from his childhood. His uninterrupted course of valour\r\nbegat envy, and as it is almost naturally ordained that kings should\r\nregard with suspicion whomsoever they see growing up in expectation\r\nof the kingdom, Bertric, as before related, jealous of his rising\r\ncharacter, was meditating how to destroy him. Egbert, apprised of\r\nthis, escaped to Offa, king of the Mercians. While Offa concealed him\r\nwith anxious care, the messengers of Bertric arrived, demanding the\r\nfugitive for punishment, and offering money for his surrender. In\r\naddition to this they solicited his daughter in marriage for their\r\nking, in order that the nuptial tie might bind them in perpetual\r\namity. In consequence Offa, who would not give way to hostile threats,\r\nyielded to flattering allurements, and Egbert, passing the sea, went\r\ninto France; a circumstance which I attribute to the counsels of God,\r\nthat a man destined to rule so great a kingdom might learn the art of\r\ngovernment from the Franks; for this people has no competitor among\r\nall the Western nations in military skill or polished manners. This\r\nill-treatment Egbert used as an incentive to “rub off the rust of\r\nindolence,” to quicken the energy of his mind, and to adopt foreign\r\ncustoms, far differing from his native barbarism. On the death,\r\ntherefore, of Bertric, being invited into Britain by frequent messages\r\nfrom his friends, he ascended the throne, and realized the fondest\r\nexpectations of his country. He was crowned in the year of our Lord’s\r\nincarnation 800, and in the thirty-fourth year of the reign of Charles\r\nthe Great, of France, who survived this event twelve years. In the\r\nmeantime Egbert, when he had acquired the regard of his subjects\r\nby his affability and kindness, first manifested his power against\r\nthose Britons who inhabit that part of the island which is called\r\nCornwall, and having subjugated them, he proceeded to make the Northern\r\nBritons,[118] who are separated from the others by an arm of the sea,\r\ntributary to him. While the fame of these victories struck terror into\r\nthe rest, Bernulf king of the Mercians, aiming at something great, and\r\nsupposing it would redound to his glory if he could remove the terror\r\nof others by his own audacity, proclaimed war against Egbert. Deeming\r\nit disgraceful to retreat, Egbert met him with much spirit, and on\r\nthen coming into action, Bernulf was defeated and fled. This battle\r\ntook place at Hellendun, A.D. 824.[119] Elated with this success, the\r\nWest Saxon king, extending his views, in the heat of victory, sent his\r\nson Ethelwulf, with Alstan, bishop of Sherborne, and a chosen band,\r\ninto Kent, for the purpose of adding to the West Saxon dominions that\r\nprovince, which had either grown indolent through long repose, or was\r\nterrified by the fame of his valour. These commanders observed their\r\ninstructions effectually, for they passed through every part of the\r\ncountry, and driving Baldred its king, with little difficulty, beyond\r\nthe river Thames, they subjugated to his dominion, in the twenty-fourth\r\nyear of his reign, Kent, Surrey, the South Saxons, and the East Saxons,\r\nwho had formerly been under the jurisdiction of his predecessors. Not\r\nlong after the East Angles, animated by the support of Egbert, killed\r\nby successive stratagems, Bernulf and Ludecan, kings of the Mercians.\r\nThe cause of their destruction was, their perpetual incursions, with\r\ntheir usual insolence, on the territories of others. Withlaf their\r\nsuccessor, first driven from his kingdom by Egbert, and afterwards\r\nadmitted as a tributary prince, augmented the West Saxon sovereignty.\r\nIn the same year the Northumbrians perceiving that themselves only\r\nremained and were a conspicuous object, and fearing lest he should\r\npour out his long-cherished anger on them, at last, though late, gave\r\nhostages, and yielded to his power. When he was thus possessed of all\r\nBritain, the rest of his life, a space of nine years, passed quietly\r\non, except that, nearly in his latter days, a piratical band of Danes\r\nmade a descent, and disturbed the peace of the kingdom. So changeable\r\nis the lot of human affairs, that he, who first singly governed all\r\nthe Angles, could derive but little satisfaction from the obedience of\r\nhis countrymen, for a foreign enemy was perpetually harassing him and\r\nhis descendants. Against these invaders the forces of the Angles made\r\na stand, but fortune no longer flattered the king with her customary\r\nfavours, but deserted him in the contest: for, when, during the greater\r\npart of the day, he had almost secured the victory, he lost the battle\r\nas the sun declined; however, by the favour of darkness, he escaped the\r\ndisgrace of being conquered. In the next action, with a small force,\r\nhe totally routed an immense multitude. At length, after a reign of\r\nthirty-seven years and seven months, he departed this life, and was\r\nburied at Winchester; leaving an ample field of glory for his son, and\r\ndeclaring, that he must be happy, if he was careful not to destroy,\r\nby the indolence natural to his race, a kingdom that himself had\r\nconsolidated with such consummate industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n_Of king Ethelwulf._ [A.D. 839-858.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 838-851.] OF KING ETHELWULF.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord’s incarnation 837,[120] Ethelwulf, whom some\r\ncall Athulf, the son of Egbert, came to the throne, and reigned twenty\r\nyears and five months. Mild by nature he infinitely preferred a life\r\nof tranquillity to dominion over many provinces; and, finally, content\r\nwith his paternal kingdom, he bestowed all the rest, which his father\r\nhad subjugated, on his son Ethelstan; of whom it is not known when, or\r\nin what manner, he died. He assisted Burhred, king of the Mercians,\r\nwith an army against the Britons, and highly exalted him by giving\r\nhim his daughter in marriage. He frequently overcame the piratical\r\nDanes, who were traversing the whole island and infesting the coast\r\nwith sudden descents, both personally and by his generals; although,\r\naccording to the chance of war, he himself experienced great and\r\nrepeated calamities; London and almost the whole of Kent being laid\r\nwaste. Yet these disasters were ever checked by the alacrity of the\r\nking’s advisers, who suffered not the enemy to trespass with impunity,\r\nbut fully avenged themselves on them by the effect of their united\r\ncounsels. For he possessed at that time, two most excellent prelates,\r\nSt. Swithun of Winchester, and Ealstan of Sherborne, who perceiving the\r\nking to be of heavy and sluggish disposition, perpetually stimulated\r\nhim, by their admonitions, to the knowledge of governing. Swithun,\r\ndisgusted with earthly, trained his master to heavenly pursuits;\r\nEalstan, knowing that the business of the kingdom ought not to be\r\nneglected, continually inspirited him against the Danes: himself\r\nfurnishing the exchequer with money, as well as regulating the army.\r\nAny peruser of the Annals[121] will find many affairs of this kind,\r\nboth entered on with courage, and terminated with success through his\r\nmeans. He held his bishopric fifty years; happy in living for so long\r\na space in the practice of good works. I should readily commend him,\r\nhad he not been swayed by worldly avarice, and usurped what belonged to\r\nothers, when by his intrigues he seized the monastery of Malmesbury for\r\nhis own use. We feel the mischief of this shameful conduct even to the\r\npresent day, although the monastery has baffled all similar violence\r\nfrom the time of his death till now, when it has fallen again into\r\nlike difficulty.[122] Thus the accursed passion of avarice corrupts\r\nthe human soul, and forces men, though great and illustrious in other\r\nrespects, into hell.\r\n\r\nEthelwulf, confiding in these two supporters, provided effectually for\r\nexternal emergencies, and did not neglect the interior concerns of\r\nhis kingdom. For after the subjugation of his enemies, turning to the\r\nestablishment of God’s worship, he granted every tenth hide of land\r\nwithin his kingdom to the servants of Christ, free from all tribute,\r\nexempt from all services. But how small a portion is this of his\r\nglory? Having settled his kingdom, he went to Rome, and there offered\r\nto St. Peter that tribute which England pays to this day,[123] before\r\npope Leo the fourth, who had also, formerly, honourably received,\r\nand anointed as king, Alfred,[124] his son, whom Ethelwulf had sent\r\nto him. Continuing there a whole year, he nobly repaired the School\r\nof the Angles, which, according to report, was first founded by Offa,\r\nking of the Mercians, and had been burned down the preceding year.[125]\r\nReturning home through France, he married Judith, daughter of Charles,\r\nking of the Franks.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE SUCCESSORS OF CHARLEMAGNE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 814-840.] SUCCESSORS OF CHARLEMAGNE.]\r\n\r\nFor Louis the Pious, son of Charles the Great, had four sons; Lothaire,\r\nPepin, Louis, and Charles, surnamed the Bald; of these Lothaire, even\r\nin his father’s life-time, usurping the title of emperor, reigned\r\nfifteen years in that part of Germany situated near the Alps which\r\nis now called Lorraine, that is, the kingdom of Lothaire, and in all\r\nItaly together with Rome. In his latter days, afflicted with sickness,\r\nhe renounced the world. He was a man by far more inhuman than all who\r\npreceded him; so much so, as even frequently to load his own father\r\nwith chains in a dungeon. Louis indeed was of mild and simple manners,\r\nbut he was unmercifully persecuted by Lothaire, because Ermengarda,\r\nby whom he had his first family, being dead, he was doatingly fond of\r\nCharles, his son by his second wife Judith. Pepin, another son of\r\nLouis, had dominion in Aquitaine[126] and Gascony. Louis, the third son\r\nof Louis, in addition to Norica, which he had already, possessed the\r\nkingdoms which his father had given him, that is to say, Alemannia,\r\nThuringia, Austrasia, Saxony, and the kingdom of the Avares, that\r\nis, the Huns. Charles obtained the half of France on the west, and\r\nall Neustria, Brittany, and the greatest part of Burgundy, Gothia,\r\nGascony, and Aquitaine, Pepin the son of Pepin being ejected thence\r\nand compelled to become a monk in the monastery of St. Methard; who\r\nafterwards escaping by flight, and returning into Aquitaine, remained\r\nthere in concealment a long time; but being again treacherously\r\ndeceived by Ranulph the governor, he was seized, brought to Charles\r\nat Senlis, and doomed to perpetual exile. Moreover, after the death\r\nof the most pious emperor, Louis, Lothaire, who had been anointed\r\nemperor eighteen years before his father’s decease, being joined by\r\nPepin with the people of Aquitaine, led an army against his brothers,\r\nthat is, Louis, the most pious king of the Bavarians, and Charles,\r\ninto the county of Auxerre to a place called Fontenai:[127] where,\r\nwhen the Franks with all their subject nations had been overwhelmed\r\nby mutual slaughter, Louis and Charles ultimately triumphed; Lothaire\r\nbeing put to flight. After this most sanguinary conflict, however,\r\npeace was made between them, and they divided the sovereignty of\r\nthe Franks, as has been mentioned above. Lothaire had three sons by\r\nErmengarda the daughter of Hugo: first, Louis, to whom he committed\r\nthe government of the Romans and of Italy; next, Lothaire, to whom he\r\nleft the imperial crown; lastly, Charles, to whom he gave Provence.\r\nLothaire died in the year of our Lord’s incarnation 855, of his reign\r\nthe thirty-third. Charles his son, who governed Provence, survived\r\nhim eight years, and then Louis, emperor of the Romans, and Lothaire\r\nhis brother, shared his kingdom of Provence. But Louis king of the\r\nNorici, that is, of the Bavarians, the son of Louis the emperor, in the\r\nyear of our Lord’s incarnation 865, after the feast of Easter, divided\r\nhis kingdom between his sons. To Caroloman he gave Norica, that is,\r\nBavaria, and the marches bordering on the Sclavonians and the Lombards;\r\nto Louis, Thuringia, the Eastern Franks, and Saxony; to Charles he\r\nleft Alemannia, and Curnwalla, that is, the county of Cornwall.[128]\r\nLouis himself reigned happily over his sons, in full power for ten\r\nyears, and then died in the year of our Lord’s incarnation 876, when he\r\nhad reigned fifty-four years. Charles king of the West Franks, in the\r\nthirty-sixth year of his reign, entering Italy, came to offer up his\r\nprayers in the church of the apostles, and was there elected emperor\r\nby all the Roman people, and consecrated by pope John on the 25th of\r\nDecember, in the year of our Lord’s incarnation 875. Thence he had\r\na prosperous return into Gaul. But in the thirty-eighth year of his\r\nreign, and the beginning of the third of his imperial dignity, he went\r\ninto Italy again, and held a conference with pope John; and returning\r\ninto Gaul, he died, after passing Mount Cenis, on the 13th of October,\r\nin the tenth of the Indiction, in the year of our Lord 877, and was\r\nsucceeded by his son Louis. Before the second year of his reign was\r\ncompleted this Louis died in the palace at Compeigne, on the sixth\r\nbefore the Ides of April, in the year of our Lord 879, the twelfth\r\nof the Indiction. After him his sons, Louis and Caroloman, divided\r\nhis kingdom. Of these, Louis gained a victory over the Normans in the\r\ndistrict of Vimeu, and died soon after on the 12th of August, in the\r\nyear of our Lord 881, the fifteenth of the Indiction, having reigned\r\ntwo years, three months, and twenty-four days. He was succeeded in his\r\ngovernment by his brother Caroloman, who, after reigning three years\r\nand six days, was wounded by a wild boar[129] in the forest of Iveline,\r\nin Mount Ericus. He departed this life in the year of our Lord 884,\r\nthe second of the Indiction, the 24th of December. Next Charles king\r\nof the Suavi, the son of Louis king of the Norici, assumed the joint\r\nempire of the Franks and Romans, in the year of the Incarnate Word\r\n885, the third of the Indiction; whose vision, as I think it worth\r\npreserving, I here subjoin:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 885.] CHARLES’S VISION.]\r\n\r\n“In the name of God most high, the King of kings. As I, Charles by\r\nthe free gift of God, emperor, king of the Germans, patrician of the\r\nRomans, and emperor of the Franks, on the sacred night of the Lord’s\r\nday, after duly performing the holy service of the evening, went to the\r\nbed of rest and sought the sleep of quietude, there came a tremendous\r\nvoice to me, saying, ‘Charles, thy spirit shall shortly depart from\r\nthee for a considerable time:’ immediately I was rapt in the spirit,\r\nand he who carried me away in the spirit was most glorious to behold.\r\nIn his hand he held a clue of thread emitting a beam of purest light,\r\nsuch as comets shed when they appear. This he began to unwind, and\r\nsaid to me, ‘Take the thread of this brilliant clue and bind and tie\r\nit firmly on the thumb of thy right hand, for thou shalt be led by\r\nit through the inextricable punishments of the infernal regions.’\r\nSaying this, he went before me, quickly unrolling the thread of the\r\nbrilliant clue, and led me into very deep and fiery valleys which were\r\nfull of pits boiling with pitch, and brimstone, and lead, and wax,\r\nand grease. There I found the bishops of my father and of my uncles:\r\nand when in terror I asked them why they were suffering such dreadful\r\ntorments? they replied, ‘We were the bishops of your father and of\r\nyour uncles, and instead of preaching, and admonishing them and their\r\npeople to peace and concord, as was our duty, we were the sowers of\r\ndiscord and the fomenters of evil. On this account we are now burning\r\nin these infernal torments, together with other lovers of slaughter\r\nand of rapine; and hither also will your bishops and ministers come,\r\nwho now delight to act as we did.’ While I was fearfully listening\r\nto this, behold the blackest demons came flying about me, with fiery\r\nclaws endeavouring to snatch away the thread of life which I held in\r\nmy hand, and to draw it to them; but repelled by the rays of the clue,\r\nthey were unable to touch it. Next running behind me, they tried to\r\ngripe me in their claws and cast me headlong into those sulphureous\r\npits: but my conductor, who carried the clue, threw a thread of light\r\nover my shoulders, and doubling it, drew me strongly after him, and\r\nin this manner we ascended lofty fiery mountains, from which arose\r\nlakes, and burning rivers, and all kinds of burning metals, wherein\r\nI found immersed innumerable souls of the vassals and princes of my\r\nfather and brothers, some up to the hair, others to the chin, and\r\nothers to the middle, who mournfully cried out to me, ‘While we were\r\nliving, we were, together with you, and your father, and brothers, and\r\nuncles, fond of battle, and slaughter, and plunder, through lust of\r\nearthly things: wherefore we now undergo punishment in these boiling\r\nrivers, and in various kinds of liquid metal.’ While I was, with the\r\ngreatest alarm, attending to these, I heard some souls behind me crying\r\nout, ‘The great will undergo still greater torment.’ I looked back\r\nand beheld on the banks of the boiling river, furnaces of pitch and\r\nbrimstone, filled with great dragons, and scorpions, and different\r\nkinds of serpents, where I also saw some of my father’s nobles, some of\r\nmy own, and of those of my brothers and of my uncles, who said, ‘Alas,\r\nCharles, you see what dreadful torments we undergo on account of our\r\nmalice, and pride, and the evil counsel which we gave to our kings and\r\nto you, for lust’s sake.’ When I could not help groaning mournfully\r\nat this, the dragons ran at me with open jaws filled with fire, and\r\nbrimstone, and pitch, and tried to swallow me up. My conductor then\r\ntripled the thread of the clue around me, which by the splendour of\r\nits rays overcame their fiery throats: he then pulled me with greater\r\nviolence, and we descended into a valley, which was in one part\r\ndark and burning like a fiery furnace, but in another so extremely\r\nenchanting and glorious, that I cannot describe it. I turned myself\r\nto the dark part which emitted flames, and there I saw some kings of\r\nmy race in extreme torture; at which, affrighted beyond measure and\r\nreduced to great distress, I expected that I should be immediately\r\nthrown into these torments by some very black giants, who made the\r\nvalley blaze with every kind of flame. I trembled very much, and, the\r\nthread of the clue of light assisting my eyes, I saw, on the side of\r\nthe valley, the light somewhat brightening, and two fountains flowing\r\nout thence: one was extremely hot; the other clear and luke-warm; two\r\nlarge casks were there besides. When, guided by the thread of light,\r\nI proceeded thither, I looked into the vessel containing boiling\r\nwater, and saw my father Louis, standing therein up to his thighs. He\r\nwas dreadfully oppressed with pain and agony, and said to me, ‘Fear\r\nnot, my lord Charles; I know that your spirit will again return into\r\nyour body, and that God hath permitted you to come hither, that you\r\nmight see for what crimes myself and all whom you have beheld, undergo\r\nthese torments. One day I am bathed in the boiling cask; next I pass\r\ninto that other delightful water; which is effected by the prayers of\r\nSt. Peter and St. Remigius, under whose patronage our royal race has\r\nhitherto reigned. But if you, and my faithful bishops and abbats, and\r\nthe whole ecclesiastical order will quickly assist me with masses,\r\nprayers and psalms, and alms, and vigils, I shall shortly be released\r\nfrom the punishment of the boiling water. For my brother Lothaire and\r\nhis son Louis have had these punishments remitted by the prayers of\r\nSt. Peter and St. Remigius, and have now entered into the joy of God’s\r\nparadise.’ He then said to me, ‘Look on your left hand;’ and when I had\r\ndone so, I saw two very deep casks boiling furiously. ‘These,’ said he,\r\n‘are prepared for you, if you do not amend and repent of your atrocious\r\ncrimes.’ I then began to be dreadfully afraid, and when my conductor\r\nsaw my spirit thus terrified, he said to me, ‘Follow me to the right\r\nof that most resplendent valley of paradise.’ As we proceeded, I\r\nbeheld my uncle Lothaire sitting in excessive brightness, in company\r\nwith glorious kings, on a topaz-stone of uncommon size, crowned with a\r\nprecious diadem: and near him, his son Louis crowned in like manner.\r\nSeeing me near at hand he called me to him in a kind voice, saying,\r\n‘Come to me, Charles, now my third successor in the empire of the\r\nRomans; I know that you have passed through the place of punishment\r\nwhere your father, my brother, is placed in the baths appointed for\r\nhim; but, by the mercy of God, he will be shortly liberated from those\r\npunishments as we have been, by the merits of St. Peter and the prayers\r\nof St. Remigius, to whom God hath given a special charge over the kings\r\nand people of the Franks, and unless he shall continue to favour and\r\nassist the dregs of our family, our race must shortly cease both from\r\nthe kingdom and the empire. Know, moreover, that the rule of the empire\r\nwill be shortly taken out of your hand, nor will you long survive. Then\r\nLouis turning to me, said, ‘The empire which you have hitherto held\r\nby hereditary right, Louis the son of my daughter is to assume.’ So\r\nsaying, there seemed immediately to appear before me a little child,\r\nand Lothaire his grandfather looking upon him, said to me, ‘This infant\r\nseems to be such an one as that which the Lord set in the midst of the\r\ndisciples, and said, “Of such is the kingdom of God, I say unto you,\r\nthat their angels do always behold the face of my father who is in\r\nheaven.” But do you bestow on him the empire by that thread of the clue\r\nwhich you hold in your hand.’ I then untied the thread from the thumb\r\nof my right hand, and gave him the whole monarchy of the empire by that\r\nthread, and immediately the entire clue, like a brilliant sun-beam,\r\nbecame rolled up in his hand. Thus, after this wonderful transaction,\r\nmy spirit, extremely wearied and affrighted, returned into my body.\r\nTherefore, let all persons know willingly or unwillingly, forasmuch\r\nas, according to the will of God, the whole empire of the Romans will\r\nrevert into his hands, and that I cannot prevail against him, compelled\r\nby the conditions of this my calling, that God, who is the ruler of\r\nthe living and the dead, will both complete and establish this; whose\r\neternal kingdom remains for ever and ever, amen.”\r\n\r\nThe vision itself, and the partition of the kingdoms, I have inserted\r\nin the very words I found them in.[130] This Charles, then, had\r\nscarcely discharged the united duties of the empire and kingdom for two\r\nyears, when Charles, the son of Louis who died at Compeigne, succeeded\r\nhim: this is the Charles who married the daughter of Edward, king of\r\nEngland, and gave Normandy to Rollo with his daughter Gisla, who was\r\nthe surety of peace and pledge of the treaty. To this Charles, in the\r\nempire, succeeded Arnulph; a king of the imperial line, tutor of that\r\nyoung Louis of whom the vision above recited speaks. Arnulph dying\r\nafter fifteen years, this Louis succeeded him, at whose death, one\r\nConrad, king of the Teutonians, obtained the sovereignty. His son\r\nHenry, who succeeded him, sent to Athelstan king of the Angles, for\r\nhis two sisters, Aldgitha and Edgitha, the latter of whom he married\r\nto his son Otho, the former to a certain duke near the Alps. Thus the\r\nempire of the Romans and the kingdom of the Franks being severed from\r\ntheir ancient union, the one is governed by emperors and the other by\r\nkings. But as I have wandered wide from my purpose, whilst indulging in\r\ntracing the descent of the illustrious kings of the Franks, I will now\r\nreturn to the course I had begun, and to Ethelwulf.\r\n\r\nOn his return after his year’s peregrination and marriage with the\r\ndaughter of Charles the Bald, as I have said, he found the dispositions\r\nof some persons contrary to his expectations. For Ethelbald his son,\r\nand Ealstan bishop of Sherborne, and Enulph earl of Somerset conspiring\r\nagainst him, endeavoured to eject him from the sovereignty; but through\r\nthe intervention of maturer counsel, the kingdom was divided between\r\nthe father and his son. This partition was extremely unequal; for\r\nmalignity was so far successful that the western portion, which was the\r\nbetter, was allotted to the son, the eastern, which was the worse, fell\r\nto the father. He, however, with incredible forbearance, dreading “a\r\nworse than civil war,” calmly gave way to his son, restraining, by a\r\nconciliatory harangue, the people who had assembled for the purpose of\r\nasserting his dignity. And though all this quarrel arose on account of\r\nhis foreign wife, yet he held her in the highest estimation, and used\r\nto place her on the throne near himself, contrary to the West Saxon\r\ncustom. For that people never suffered the king’s consort either to be\r\nseated by the king or to be honoured with the appellation of queen, on\r\naccount of the depravity of Eadburga, daughter of Offa, king of the\r\nMercians; who, as we have before mentioned, being married to Bertric,\r\nking of the West Saxons, used to persuade him, a tender-hearted man,\r\nas they report, to the destruction of the innocent, and would herself\r\ntake off by poison those against whom her accusations failed. This was\r\nexemplified in the case of a youth much beloved by the king, whom she\r\nmade away with in this manner: and immediately afterwards Bertric fell\r\nsick, wasted away and died, from having previously drunk of the same\r\npotion, unknown to the queen. The rumour of this getting abroad, drove\r\nthe poisoner from the kingdom. Proceeding to Charles the Great, she\r\nhappened to find him standing with one of his sons, and after offering\r\nhim presents, the emperor, in a playful, jocose manner, commanded\r\nher to choose which she liked best, himself, or his son. Eadburga\r\nchoosing the young man for his blooming beauty, Charles replied with\r\nsome emotion, “Had you chosen me, you should have had my son, but\r\nsince you have chosen him, you shall have neither.” He then placed her\r\nin a monastery where she might pass her life in splendour; but, soon\r\nafter, finding her guilty of incontinence he expelled her.[131] Struck\r\nwith this instance of depravity, the Saxons framed the regulation I\r\nhave alluded to, though Ethelwulf invalidated it by his affectionate\r\nkindness. He made his will a few months before he died, in which, after\r\nthe division of the kingdom between his sons Ethelbald and Ethelbert,\r\nhe set out the dowry of his daughter, and ordered, that, till the end\r\nof time, one poor person should be clothed and fed from every tenth\r\nhide of his inheritance, and that every year, three hundred mancas of\r\ngold[132] should be sent to Rome, of which one-third should be given\r\nto St. Peter, another to St. Paul for lamps, and the other to the pope\r\nfor distribution. He died two years after he came from Rome, and was\r\nburied at Winchester in the cathedral. But that I may return from my\r\ndigression to my proposed series, I shall here subjoin the charter of\r\necclesiastical immunities which he granted to all England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 857.] ETHELWULF’S CHARTER.]\r\n\r\n“Our Lord Jesus Christ reigning for evermore. Since we perceive that\r\nperilous times are pressing on us, that there are in our days hostile\r\nburnings, and plunderings of our wealth, and most cruel depredations\r\nby devastating enemies, and many tribulations of barbarous and pagan\r\nnations, threatening even our destruction: therefore I Ethelwulf\r\nking of the West Saxons, with the advice of my bishops and nobility,\r\nhave established a wholesome counsel and general remedy. I have\r\ndecided that there shall be given to the servants of God, whether\r\nmale or female or laymen,[133] a certain hereditary portion of the\r\nlands possessed by persons of every degree, that is to say, the tenth\r\nmanse,[134] but where it is less than this, then the tenth part; that\r\nit may be exonerated from all secular services, all royal tributes\r\ngreat and small, or those taxes which we call Witereden. And let it\r\nbe free from all things, for the release of our souls, that it may be\r\napplied to God’s service alone, exempt from expeditions, the building\r\nof bridges, or of forts; in order that they may more diligently pour\r\nforth their prayers to God for us without ceasing, inasmuch as we have\r\nin some measure alleviated their service. Moreover it hath pleased\r\nEalstan bishop of Sherborne, and Swithun bishop of Winchester, with\r\ntheir abbats and the servants of God, to appoint that all our brethren\r\nand sisters at each church, every week on the day of Mercury, that\r\nis to say, Wednesday, should sing fifty psalms, and every priest\r\ntwo masses, one for king Ethelwulf, and another for his nobility,\r\nconsenting to this gift, for the pardon and alleviation of their sins;\r\nfor the king while living, they shall say, ‘Let us pray: O God, who\r\njustifiest.’ For the nobility while living, ‘Stretch forth, O Lord.’\r\nAfter they are dead; for the departed king, singly: for the departed\r\nnobility, in common: and let this be firmly appointed for all the times\r\nof Christianity, in like manner as that immunity is appointed, so long\r\nas faith shall increase in the nation of the Angles. This charter of\r\ndonation was written in the year of our Lord’s incarnation 844,[135]\r\nthe fourth of the indiction, and on the nones, i. e. the fifth day of\r\nNovember, in the city of Winchester, in the church of St. Peter, before\r\nthe high altar, and they have done this for the honour of St. Michael\r\nthe archangel, and of St. Mary the glorious queen, the mother of God,\r\nand also for the honour of St. Peter the chief of the apostles, and\r\nof our most holy father pope Gregory, and all saints. And then, for\r\ngreater security, king Ethelwulf placed the charter on the altar of St.\r\nPeter, and the bishops received it in behalf of God’s holy faith, and\r\nafterwards transmitted it to all churches in their dioceses according\r\nto the above-cited form.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 858.] WEST SAXON KINGS.]\r\n\r\nFrom this king the English chronicles trace the line of the generation\r\nof their kings upwards, even to Adam, as we know Luke the evangelist\r\nhas done with respect to our Lord Jesus; and which, perhaps, it will\r\nnot be superfluous for me to do, though it is to be apprehended, that\r\nthe utterance of barbarous names may shock the ears of persons unused\r\nto them. Ethelwulf was the son of Egbert, Egbert of Elmund, Elmund\r\nof Eafa, Eafa of Eoppa, Eoppa was the son of Ingild, the brother of\r\nking Ina, who were both sons of Kenred; Kenred of Ceolwald, Ceolwald\r\nof Cutha, Cutha of Cuthwin, Cuthwin of Ceawlin, Ceawlin of Cynric,\r\nCynric of Creoding, Creoding of Cerdic, who was the first king of the\r\nWest Saxons; Cerdic of Elesa, Elesa of Esla, Esla of Gewis, Gewis of\r\nWig, Wig of Freawin, Freawin of Frithogar, Frithogar of Brond, Brond\r\nof Beldeg, Beldeg of Woden; and from him, as we have often remarked,\r\nproceeded the kings of many nations. Woden was the son of Frithowald,\r\nFrithowald of Frealaf, Frealaf of Finn, Finn of Godwulf, Godwulf of\r\nGeat, Geat of Tætwa, Tætwa of Beaw, Beaw of Sceldi, Sceldi of Sceaf;\r\nwho, as some affirm, was driven on a certain island in Germany, called\r\nScamphta, (of which Jornandes,[136] the historian of the Goths,\r\nspeaks,) a little boy in a skiff, without any attendant, asleep, with\r\na handful of corn at his head, whence he was called Sceaf; and, on\r\naccount of his singular appearance, being well received by the men\r\nof that country, and carefully educated, in his riper age he reigned\r\nin a town which was called Slaswic, but at present Haitheby; which\r\ncountry, called old Anglia, whence the Angles came into Britain, is\r\nsituated between the Saxons and the Gioths. Sceaf was the son of\r\nHeremod, Heremod of Itermon, Itermon of Hathra, Hathra of Guala, Guala\r\nof Bedwig, Bedwig of Streaf, and he, as they say, was the son of Noah,\r\nborn in the Ark.[137]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n_Of Ethelbald, Ethelbert, and Ethelred, sons of Ethelwulf._\r\n\r\n[A.D. 858-872.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 857,[138] the two sons of Ethelwulf divided\r\ntheir paternal kingdom; Ethelbald reigned in West Saxony, and Ethelbert\r\nin Kent. Ethelbald, base and perfidious, defiled the bed of his\r\nfather by marrying, after his decease, Judith his step-mother. Dying,\r\nhowever, at the end of five years, and being interred at Sherborne,\r\nthe whole government devolved upon his brother. In his time a band\r\nof pirates landing at Southampton, proceeded to plunder the populous\r\ncity of Winchester, but soon after being spiritedly repulsed by the\r\nking’s generals, and suffering considerable loss, they put to sea, and\r\ncoasting round, chose the Isle of Thanet, in Kent, for their winter\r\nquarters. The people of Kent, giving hostages, and promising a sum of\r\nmoney, would have remained quiet, had not these pirates, breaking the\r\ntreaty, laid waste the whole district by nightly predatory excursions,\r\nbut roused by this conduct they mustered a force and drove out the\r\ntruce-breakers. Moreover Ethelbert, having ruled the kingdom with\r\nvigour and with mildness, paid the debt of nature after five years,\r\nand was buried at Sherborne.\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 867, Ethelred, the son of Ethelwulf, obtained\r\nhis paternal kingdom, and ruled it for the same number of years as his\r\nbrothers. Surely it would be a pitiable and grievous destiny, that all\r\nof them should perish by an early death, unless it is, that in such a\r\ntempest of evils, these royal youths should prefer an honourable end\r\nto a painful government. Indeed, so bravely and so vigorously did they\r\ncontend for their country, that it was not to be imputed to them that\r\ntheir valour did not succeed in its design. Finally, it is related,\r\nthat this king was personally engaged in hostile conflict against the\r\nenemy nine times in one year, with various success indeed, but for the\r\nmost part victor, besides sudden attacks, in which, from his skill in\r\nwarfare, he frequently worsted those straggling depredators. In these\r\nseveral actions the Danes lost nine earls and one king, besides common\r\npeople innumerable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 867-871.] BATTLE OF ESCHENDUN.]\r\n\r\nOne battle memorable beyond all the rest was that which took place at\r\nEschendun.[139] The Danes, having collected an army at this place,\r\ndivided it into two bodies; their two kings commanded the one, all\r\ntheir earls the other. Ethelred drew near with his brother Alfred. It\r\nfell to the lot of Ethelred to oppose the kings, while Alfred was to\r\nattack the earls. Both armies eagerly prepared for battle, but night\r\napproaching deferred the conflict till the ensuing day. Scarcely had\r\nthe morning dawned ere Alfred was ready at his post, but his brother,\r\nintent on his devotions, had remained in his tent; and when urged on by\r\na message, that the pagans were rushing forward with unbounded fury,\r\nhe declared that he should not move a step till his religious services\r\nwere ended. This piety of the king was of infinite advantage to his\r\nbrother, who was too impetuous from the thoughtlessness of youth, and\r\nhad already far advanced. The battalions of the Angles were now giving\r\nway, and even bordering on flight, in consequence of their adversaries\r\npressing upon them from the higher ground, for the Christians were\r\nfighting in an unfavourable situation, when the king himself, signed\r\nwith the cross of God, unexpectedly hastened forward, dispersing the\r\nenemy, and rallying his subjects. The Danes, terrified equally by his\r\ncourage and the divine manifestation, consulted their safety by flight.\r\nHere fell Oseg their king, five earls, and an innumerable multitude of\r\ncommon people.\r\n\r\nThe reader will be careful to observe that during this time, the\r\nkings of the Mercians and of the Northumbrians, eagerly seizing the\r\nopportunity of the arrival of the Danes, with whom Ethelred was\r\nfully occupied in fighting, and somewhat relieved from their bondage\r\nto the West Saxons, had nearly regained their original power. All\r\nthe provinces, therefore, were laid waste by cruel depredations,\r\nbecause each king chose rather to resist the enemy within his own\r\nterritories, than to assist his neighbours in their difficulties; and\r\nthus preferring to avenge injury rather than to prevent it, they ruined\r\ntheir country by their senseless conduct. The Danes acquired strength\r\nwithout impediment, whilst the apprehensions of the inhabitants\r\nincreased, and each successive victory, from the addition of captives,\r\nbecame the means of obtaining another. The country of the East Angles,\r\ntogether with their cities and villages, was possessed by these\r\nplunderers; its king, St. Edmund, slain by them in the year of our\r\nLord’s incarnation 870, on the tenth of November, purchased an eternal\r\nkingdom by putting off this mortal life. The Mercians, often harassed,\r\nalleviated their afflictions by giving hostages. The Northumbrians,\r\nlong embroiled in civil dissensions, made up their differences on the\r\napproach of the enemy. Replacing Osbert their king, whom they had\r\nexpelled, upon the throne, and collecting a powerful force, they went\r\nout to meet the foe; but being easily repelled, they shut themselves\r\nup in the city of York, which was presently after set on fire by the\r\nvictors; and when the flames were raging to the utmost and consuming\r\nthe very walls, they perished for their country in the conflagration.\r\nIn this manner Northumbria, the prize of war, for a considerable time\r\nafter, felt the more bitterly, through a sense of former liberty,\r\nthe galling yoke of the barbarians. And now Ethelred, worn down with\r\nnumberless labours, died and was buried at Wimborne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\n_Of king Alfred._ [A.D. 872--901.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 872-878.] ALFRED’S DREAM.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord’s incarnation 872, Alfred, the youngest son\r\nof Ethelwulf, who had, as has been related before, received the royal\r\nunction and crown from pope Leo the fourth at Rome, acceded to the\r\nsovereignty and retained it with the greatest difficulty, but with\r\nequal valour, twenty-eight years and a half. To trace in detail\r\nthe mazy labyrinth of his labours was never my design; because a\r\nrecapitulation of his exploits in their exact order of time would\r\noccasion some confusion to the reader. For, to relate how a hostile\r\narmy, driven by himself or his generals, from one part of a district,\r\nretreated to another; and, dislodged thence, sought a fresh scene of\r\noperation and filled every place with rapine and slaughter; and, if\r\nI may use the expression, “to go round the whole island with him,”\r\nmight to some seem the height of folly: consequently I shall touch\r\non all points summarily. For nine successive years battling with his\r\nenemies, sometimes deceived by false treaties, and sometimes wreaking\r\nhis vengeance on the deceivers, he was at last reduced to such extreme\r\ndistress, that scarcely three counties, that is to say, Hampshire,\r\nWiltshire, and Somersetshire, stood fast by their allegiance, as he\r\nwas compelled to retreat to a certain island called Athelney, which\r\nfrom its marshy situation was hardly accessible. He was accustomed\r\nafterwards, when in happier circumstances, to relate to his companions,\r\nin a lively and agreeable manner, his perils there, and how he escaped\r\nthem by the merits of St. Cuthbert;[140] for it frequently happens\r\nthat men are pleased with the recollection of those circumstances,\r\nwhich formerly they dreaded to encounter. During his retreat in this\r\nisland, as he was one day in the house alone, his companions being\r\ndispersed on the river side for the purpose of fishing, he endeavoured\r\nto refresh his weary frame with sleep: and behold! Cuthbert, formerly\r\nbishop of Lindisfarne, addressed him, while sleeping, in the following\r\nmanner:--“I am Cuthbert, if ever you heard of me; God hath sent me to\r\nannounce good fortune to you; and since England has already largely\r\npaid the penalty of her crimes, God now, through the merits of her\r\nnative saints, looks upon her with an eye of mercy. You too, so\r\npitiably banished from your kingdom, shall shortly be again seated\r\nwith honour on your throne; of which I give you this extraordinary\r\ntoken: your fishers shall this day bring home a great quantity of large\r\nfish in baskets; which will be so much the more extraordinary because\r\nthe river, at this time hard-bound with ice, could warrant no such\r\nexpectation; especially as the air now dripping with cold rain mocks\r\nthe art of the fisher. But, when your fortune shall succeed to your\r\nwishes, you will act as becomes a king, if you conciliate God your\r\nhelper, and me his messenger, with suitable devotion.” Saying thus,\r\nthe saint divested the sleeping king of his anxiety; and comforted\r\nhis mother also, who was lying near him, and endeavouring to invite\r\nsome gentle slumbers to her hard couch to relieve her cares, with the\r\nsame joyful intelligence. When they awoke, they repeatedly declared\r\nthat each had had the self-same dream, when the fishermen entering,\r\ndisplayed such a multitude of fishes as would have been sufficient to\r\nsatisfy the appetite of a numerous army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 878-890.] DEFEAT OF THE DANES.]\r\n\r\nNot long after, venturing from his concealment, he hazarded an\r\nexperiment of consummate art. Accompanied only by one of his most\r\nfaithful adherents, he entered the tent of the Danish king under the\r\ndisguise of a minstrel;[141] and being admitted, as a professor of\r\nthe mimic art, to the banqueting room, there was no object of secrecy\r\nthat he did not minutely attend to both with eyes and ears. Remaining\r\nthere several days, till he had satisfied his mind on every matter\r\nwhich he wished to know, he returned to Athelney: and assembling his\r\ncompanions, pointed out the indolence of the enemy and the easiness of\r\ntheir defeat. All were eager for the enterprise, and himself collecting\r\nforces from every side, and learning exactly the situation of the\r\nbarbarians from scouts he had sent out for that purpose, he suddenly\r\nattacked and routed them with incredible slaughter. The remainder,\r\nwith their king, gave hostages that they would embrace Christianity and\r\ndepart from the country; which they performed. For their king, Gothrun,\r\nwhom our people call Gurmund, with thirty nobles and almost all the\r\ncommonalty, was baptized, Alfred standing for him; and the provinces\r\nof the East Angles, and Northumbrians[142] were given up to him, in\r\norder that he might, under fealty to the king, protect with hereditary\r\nright, what before he had overrun with predatory incursion. However,\r\nas the Ethiopian cannot change his skin, he domineered over these\r\ntributary provinces with the haughtiness of a tyrant for eleven years,\r\nand died in the twelfth, transmitting to his posterity the inheritance\r\nof his disloyalty, until subdued by Athelstan, the grandson of Alfred,\r\nthey were, though reluctantly, compelled to admit one common king of\r\nEngland, as we see at the present day. Such of the Danes as had refused\r\nto become Christians, together with Hastings, went over sea, where the\r\ninhabitants are best able to tell what cruelties they perpetrated. For\r\noverrunning the whole maritime coasts to the Tuscan sea, they unpeopled\r\nParis and Tours, as well as many other cities seated on the Seine and\r\nLoire, those noted rivers of France. At that time the bodies of many\r\nsaints being taken up from the spot of their original interment and\r\nconveyed to safer places, have ennobled foreign churches with their\r\nrelics even to this day. Then also the body of St. Martin, venerated,\r\nas Sidonius says, over the whole earth, in which virtue resides though\r\nlife be at an end, was taken to Auxerre, by the clergy of his church,\r\nand placed in that of St. German, where it astonished the people of\r\nthat district by unheard-of miracles. And when they who came thither,\r\nout of gratitude for cures performed, contributed many things to\r\nrequite the labours of those who had borne him to this church, as is\r\ncommonly the case, a dispute arose about the division of the money;\r\nthe Turonians claiming the whole, because their patron had called the\r\ncontributors together by his miracles: the natives, on the other hand,\r\nalleging that St. German was not unequal in merit, and was of equal\r\nkindness; that both indeed had the same power, but that the prerogative\r\nof their church preponderated. To solve this knotty doubt, a leprous\r\nperson was sought, and placed, nearly at the last gasp, wasted to a\r\nskeleton, and already dead, as it were, in a living carcass, between\r\nthe bodies of the two saints. All human watch was prohibited for the\r\nwhole night: the glory of Martin alone was vigilant; for the next\r\nday, the skin of the man on his side appeared clear, while on that of\r\nGerman, it was discoloured with its customary deformity. And, that\r\nthey might not attribute this miracle to chance, they turned the yet\r\ndiseased side to Martin. As soon as the morning began to dawn, the man\r\nwas found by the hastening attendants with his skin smooth, perfectly\r\ncured, declaring the kind condescension of the resident patron, who\r\nyielded to the honour of such a welcome stranger. Thus the Turonians,\r\nboth at that time and afterwards, safely filled their common purse\r\nby the assistance of their patron, till a more favourable gale of\r\npeace restored them to their former residence. For these marauders\r\ninfesting France for thirteen years, and being at last overcome by\r\nthe emperor Ernulph and the people of Brittany in many encounters,\r\nretreated into England as a convenient receptacle for their tyranny.\r\nDuring this space of time Alfred had reduced the whole island to his\r\npower, with the exception of what the Danes possessed. The Angles\r\nhad willingly surrendered to his dominion, rejoicing that they had\r\nproduced a man capable of leading them to liberty. He granted London,\r\nthe chief city of the Mercian kingdom, to a nobleman named Ethered,\r\nto hold in fealty, and gave him his daughter Ethelfled in marriage.\r\nEthered conducted himself with equal valour and fidelity; defended\r\nhis trust with activity, and kept the East Angles and Northumbrians,\r\nwho were fomenting rebellion against the king, within due bounds,\r\ncompelling them to give hostages. Of what infinite service this was,\r\nthe following emergency proved. After England had rejoiced for thirteen\r\nyears in the tranquillity of peace and in the fertility of her soil,\r\nthe northern pest of barbarians again returned. With them returned\r\nwar and slaughter; again arose conspiracies of the Northumbrians and\r\nEast Angles: but neither strangers nor natives experienced the same\r\nfortune as in former years; the one party, diminished by foreign\r\ncontests, were less alert in their invasions; while the other, now\r\nexperienced in war and animated by the exhortations of the king, were\r\nnot only more ready to resist, but also to attack. The king himself\r\nwas, with his usual activity, present in every action, ever daunting\r\nthe invaders, and at the same time inspiriting his subjects, with the\r\nsignal display of his courage. He would oppose himself singly to the\r\nenemy; and by his own personal exertions rally his declining forces.\r\nThe very places are yet pointed out by the inhabitants where he felt\r\nthe vicissitudes of good and evil fortune. It was necessary to contend\r\nwith Alfred even after he was overcome, after he was prostrate;\r\ninsomuch that when he might be supposed altogether vanquished, he would\r\nescape like a slippery serpent, from the hand which held him, glide\r\nfrom his lurking-place, and, with undiminished courage, spring on his\r\ninsulting enemies: he was insupportable after flight, and became more\r\ncircumspect from the recollection of defeat, more bold from the thirst\r\nof vengeance. His children by Elswitha, the daughter of earl Athelred,\r\nwere Ethelswitha, Edward who reigned after him; Ethelfled who was\r\nmarried to Ethered earl of the Mercians; Ethelwerd, whom they celebrate\r\nas being extremely learned; Elfred and Ethelgiva, virgins. His health\r\nwas so bad that he was constantly disquieted either by the piles or\r\nsome disorder of the intestines. It is said, however, that he entreated\r\nthis from God, in his supplications, in order that, by the admonition\r\nof pain, he might be less anxious after earthly delights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 893.] KING ALFRED’S INSTITUTIONS.]\r\n\r\nYet amid these circumstances the private life of the king is to be\r\nadmired and celebrated with the highest praise. For although, as some\r\none has said, “Laws must give way amid the strife of arms,” yet he,\r\namid the sound of trumpets and the din of war, enacted statutes by\r\nwhich his people might equally familiarise themselves to religious\r\nworship and to military discipline. And since, from the example of\r\nthe barbarians, the natives themselves began to lust after rapine,\r\ninsomuch that there was no safe intercourse without a military guard,\r\nhe appointed centuries, which they call “hundreds,” and decennaries,\r\nthat is to say, “tythings,” so that every Englishman, living according\r\nto law, must be a member of both. If any one was accused of a crime,\r\nhe was obliged immediately to produce persons from the hundred and\r\ntything to become his surety; and whosoever was unable to find such\r\nsurety, must dread the severity of the laws. If any who was impleaded\r\nmade his escape either before or after he had found surety, all persons\r\nof the hundred and tything paid a fine to the king. By this regulation\r\nhe diffused such peace throughout the country, that he ordered golden\r\nbracelets, which might mock the eager desires of the passengers while\r\nno one durst take them away, to be hung up on the public causeways,\r\nwhere the roads crossed each other. Ever intent on almsgiving, he\r\nconfirmed the privileges of the churches, as appointed by his father,\r\nand sent many presents over sea to Rome and to St. Thomas in India.\r\nSighelm, bishop of Sherborne, sent ambassador for this purpose,\r\npenetrated successfully into India, a matter of astonishment even in\r\nthe present time. Returning thence, he brought back many brilliant\r\nexotic gems and aromatic juices in which that country abounds, and\r\na present more precious than the finest gold, part of our Saviour’s\r\ncross, sent by pope Marinus to the king. He erected monasteries\r\nwherever he deemed it fitting; one in Athelney, where he lay concealed,\r\nas has been above related, and there he made John abbat, a native of\r\nOld Saxony; another at Winchester, which is called the New-minster,\r\nwhere he appointed Grimbald abbat, who, at his invitation, had been\r\nsent into England by Fulco archbishop of Rheims, known to him, as they\r\nsay, by having kindly entertained him when a child on his way to Rome.\r\nThe cause of his being sent for was that by his activity he might\r\nawaken the study of literature in England, which was now slumbering\r\nand almost expiring. The monastery of Shaftesbury also he filled with\r\nnuns, where he made his daughter Ethelgiva abbess. From St. David’s\r\nhe procured a person named Asser,[143] a man of skill in literature,\r\nwhom he made bishop of Sherborne. This man explained the meaning of\r\nthe works of Boethius, on the Consolation of Philosophy, in clearer\r\nterms, and the king himself translated them into the English language.\r\nAnd since there was no good scholar in his own kingdom, he sent for\r\nWerefrith bishop of Worcester out of Mercia, who by command of the\r\nking rendered into the English tongue the books of Gregory’s Dialogues.\r\nAt this time Johannes Scotus is supposed to have lived; a man of clear\r\nunderstanding and amazing eloquence. He had long since, from the\r\ncontinued tumult of war around him, retired into France to Charles the\r\nBald, at whose request he had translated the Hierarchia of Dionysius\r\nthe Areopagite, word for word, out of the Greek into Latin. He composed\r\na book also, which he entitled περὶ φύσεων μερισμοῦ, or Of the Division\r\nof Nature,[144] extremely useful in solving the perplexity of certain\r\nindispensable inquiries, if he be pardoned for some things in which he\r\ndeviated from the opinions of the Latins, through too close attention\r\nto the Greeks. In after time, allured by the munificence of Alfred, he\r\ncame into England, and at our monastery, as report says, was pierced\r\nwith the iron styles of the boys whom he was instructing, and was even\r\nlooked upon as a martyr; which phrase I have not made use of to the\r\ndisparagement of his holy spirit, as though it were matter of doubt,\r\nespecially as his tomb on the left side of the altar, and the verses of\r\nhis epitaph, record his fame.[145] These, though rugged and deficient\r\nin the polish of our days, are not so uncouth for ancient times:\r\n\r\n “Here lies a saint, the sophist John, whose days\r\n  On earth were grac’d with deepest learning’s praise:\r\n  Deem’d meet at last by martyrdom to gain\r\n  Christ’s kingdom, where the saints for ever reign.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 893.] STORY OF JOHN THE SCOT.]\r\n\r\nConfiding in these auxiliaries, the king gave his whole soul to the\r\ncultivation of the liberal arts, insomuch that no Englishman was\r\nquicker in comprehending, or more elegant in translating. This was the\r\nmore remarkable, because until twelve years of age he absolutely knew\r\nnothing of literature.[146] At that time, lured by a kind mother,\r\nwho under the mask of amusement promised that he should have a little\r\nbook which she held in her hand for a present if he would learn it\r\nquickly, he entered upon learning in sport indeed at first, but\r\nafterwards drank of the stream with unquenchable avidity. He translated\r\ninto English the greater part of the Roman authors, bringing off the\r\nnoblest spoil of foreign intercourse for the use of his subjects; of\r\nwhich the chief books were Orosius, Gregory’s Pastoral, Bede’s History\r\nof the Angles, Boethius Of the Consolation of Philosophy, his own\r\nbook, which he called in his vernacular tongue “Handboc,” that is, a\r\nmanual.[147] Moreover he infused a great regard for literature into\r\nhis countrymen, stimulating them both with rewards and punishments,\r\nallowing no ignorant person to aspire to any dignity in the court. He\r\ndied just as he had begun a translation of the Psalms. In the prologue\r\nto “The Pastoral” he observes, “that he was incited to translate these\r\nbooks into English because the churches which had formerly contained\r\nnumerous libraries had, together with their books, been burnt by the\r\nDanes.” And again, “that the pursuit of literature had gone to decay\r\nalmost over the whole island, because each person was more occupied in\r\nthe preservation of his life than in the perusal of books; wherefore\r\nhe so far consulted the good of his countrymen, that they might now\r\nhastily view what hereafter, if peace should ever return, they might\r\nthoroughly comprehend in the Latin language.” Again, “That he designed\r\nto transmit this book, transcribed by his order, to every see, with\r\na golden style in which was a mancus of gold; that there was nothing\r\nof his own opinions inserted in this or his other translations, but\r\nthat everything was derived from those celebrated men Plegmund[148]\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, Asser the bishop, Grimbald and John the\r\npriests.” But, in short, I may thus briefly elucidate his whole\r\nlife: he so divided the twenty-four hours of the day and night as to\r\nemploy eight of them in writing, in reading, and in prayer, eight in\r\nthe refreshment of his body, and eight in dispatching the business of\r\nthe realm. There was in his chapel a candle consisting of twenty-four\r\ndivisions, and an attendant, whose peculiar province it was to admonish\r\nthe king of his several duties by its consumption. One half of all\r\nrevenues, provided they were justly acquired, he gave to his[149]\r\nmonasteries, all his other income he divided into two equal parts, the\r\nfirst was again subdivided into three, of which the first was given to\r\nthe servants of his court, the second to artificers whom he constantly\r\nemployed in the erection of new edifices, in a manner surprising and\r\nhitherto unknown to the English, the third he gave to strangers. The\r\nsecond part of the revenue was divided in such a mode that the first\r\nportion should be given to the poor of his kingdom, the second to\r\nthe monasteries, the third to scholars,[150] the fourth to foreign\r\nchurches. He was a strict inquirer into the sentences passed by his\r\nmagistrates, and a severe corrector of such as were unjust. He had one\r\nunusual and unheard-of custom, which was, that he always carried in his\r\nbosom a book in which the daily order of the Psalms was contained, for\r\nthe purpose of carefully perusing it, if at any time he had leisure. In\r\nthis way he passed his life, much respected by neighbouring princes,\r\nand gave his daughter Ethelswitha in marriage to Baldwin earl of\r\nFlanders, by whom he had Arnulf and Ethelwulf; the former received\r\nfrom his father the county of Boulogne, from the other at this day are\r\ndescended the earls of Flanders.[151]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 893.] KING ALFRED’S DEATH.]\r\n\r\nAlfred, paying the debt of nature, was buried at Winchester, in the\r\nmonastery which he had founded; to build the offices of which Edward,\r\nhis son, purchased a sufficient space of ground from the bishop and\r\ncanons, giving, for every foot, a mancus of gold of the statute weight.\r\nThe endurance of the king was astonishing, in suffering such a sum\r\nto be extorted from him; but he did not choose to offer a sacrifice\r\nto God from the robbery of the poor. These two churches were so\r\ncontiguous, that, when singing, they heard each others’ voices; on this\r\nand other accounts an unhappy jealousy was daily stirring up causes of\r\ndissension, which produced frequent injuries on either side. For this\r\nreason that monastery was lately removed out of the city, and became\r\na more healthy, as well as a more conspicuous, residence. They report\r\nthat Alfred was first buried in the cathedral, because his monastery\r\nwas unfinished, but that afterwards, on account of the folly of the\r\ncanons, who asserted that the royal spirit, resuming its carcass,\r\nwandered nightly through the buildings, Edward, his son and successor,\r\nremoved the remains of his father, and gave them a quiet resting-place\r\nin the new minster.[152] These and similar superstitions, such as that\r\nthe dead body of a wicked man runs about, after death, by the agency\r\nof the devil, the English hold with almost inbred credulity,[153]\r\nborrowing them from the heathens, according to the expression of Virgil,\r\n\r\n  “Forms such as flit, they say, when life is gone.”[154]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n_Of Edward the son of Alfred._ [A.D. 901-924.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 901.] EDWARD.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord’s incarnation, 901, Edward, the son of Alfred,\r\nsucceeded to the government, and held it twenty-three years: he was\r\nmuch inferior to his father in literature, but greatly excelled in\r\nextent of power. For Alfred, indeed, united the two kingdoms of the\r\nMercian and West Saxons, holding that of the Mercians only nominally,\r\nas he had assigned it to prince Ethelred: but at his death Edward first\r\nbrought the Mercians altogether under his power, next, the West[155]\r\nand East Angles, and Northumbrians, who had become one nation with the\r\nDanes; the Scots, who inhabit the northern part of the island; and all\r\nthe Britons, whom we call Welsh, after perpetual battles, in which he\r\nwas always successful. He devised a mode of frustrating the incursions\r\nof the Danes; for he repaired many ancient cities, or built new ones,\r\nin places calculated for his purpose, and filled them with a military\r\nforce, to protect the inhabitants and repel the enemy. Nor was his\r\ndesign unsuccessful; for the inhabitants became so extremely valorous\r\nin these contests, that if they heard of an enemy approaching, they\r\nrushed out to give them battle, even without consulting the king or his\r\ngenerals, and constantly surpassed them, both in number and in warlike\r\nskill. Thus the enemy became an object of contempt to the soldiery and\r\nof derision to the king. At last some fresh assailants, who had come\r\nover under the command of Ethelwald, the son of the king’s uncle, were\r\nall, together with himself, cut off to a man; those before, settled in\r\nthe country, being either destroyed or spared under the denomination\r\nof Angles. Ethelwald indeed had attempted many things in the earlier\r\ndays of this king; and, disdaining subjection to him, declared himself\r\nhis inferior neither in birth nor valour; but being driven into exile\r\nby the nobility, who had sworn allegiance to Edward, he brought over\r\nthe pirates; with whom, meeting his death, as I have related, he gave\r\nproof of the folly of resisting those who are our superiors in power.\r\nAlthough Edward may be deservedly praised for these transactions,\r\nyet, in my opinion, the palm should be more especially given to his\r\nfather, who certainly laid the foundation of this extent of dominion.\r\nAnd here indeed Ethelfled, sister of the king and relict of Ethered,\r\nought not to be forgotten, as she was a powerful accession to his\r\nparty, the delight of his subjects, the dread of his enemies, a woman\r\nof an enlarged soul, who, from the difficulty experienced in her first\r\nlabour, ever after refused the embraces of her husband; protesting\r\nthat it was unbecoming the daughter of a king to give way to a delight\r\nwhich, after a time, produced such painful consequences. This spirited\r\nheroine assisted her brother greatly with her advice, was of equal\r\nservice in building cities, nor could you easily discern, whether it\r\nwas more owing to fortune or her own exertions, that a woman should\r\nbe able to protect men at home, and to intimidate them abroad. She\r\ndied five years before her brother, and was buried in the monastery of\r\nSt. Peter’s, at Gloucester; which, in conjunction with her husband,\r\nEthered, she had erected with great solicitude. Thither too she had\r\ntransferred the bones of St. Oswald, the king, from Bardney; but this\r\nmonastery being destroyed in succeeding time by the Danes, Aldred,\r\narchbishop of York, founded another, which is now the chief in that\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nAs the king had many daughters, he gave Edgiva to Charles, king of\r\nFrance, the son of Lewis the Stammerer, son of Charles the Bald, whose\r\ndaughter, as I have repeatedly observed, Ethelwulf had married on his\r\nreturn from Rome; and, as the opportunity has now presented itself, the\r\ncandid reader will not think it irrelevant, if I state the names of his\r\nwives and children. By Egwina, an illustrious lady, he had Athelstan,\r\nhis first-born, and a daughter, whose name I cannot particularise, but\r\nher brother gave her in marriage to Sihtric, king of the Northumbrians.\r\nThe second son of Edward was Ethelward, by Elfleda, daughter of earl\r\nEtheline; deeply versed in literature, much resembling his grandfather\r\nAlfred in features and disposition, but who departed, by an early\r\ndeath, soon after his father. By the same wife he had Edwin, of whose\r\nfate what the received opinion is I shall hereafter describe, not with\r\nconfidence, but doubtingly. By her too he had six daughters; Edfleda,\r\nEdgiva, Ethelhilda, Ethilda, Edgitha, Elgifa: the first and third\r\nvowing celibacy to God, renounced the pleasure of earthly nuptials;\r\nEdfleda in a religious, and Ethelhilda in a lay habit: they both lie\r\nburied near their mother, at Winchester. Her father gave Edgiva, as I\r\nhave mentioned, to king Charles,[156] and her brother, Athelstan, gave\r\nEthilda to Hugh:[157] this same brother also sent Edgitha and Elgifa to\r\nHenry,[158] emperor of Germany, the second of whom he gave to his son\r\nOtho, the other to a certain duke, near the Alps. Again; by his third\r\nwife, named Edgiva, he had two sons, Edmund and Edred, each of whom\r\nreigned after Athelstan: two daughters, Eadburga, and Edgiva; Eadburga,\r\na virgin, dedicated to Christ, lies buried at Winchester; Edgiva, a\r\nlady of incomparable beauty, was united, by her brother Athelstan, to\r\nLewis, prince of Aquitaine.[159] Edward had brought up his daughters\r\nin such wise, that in childhood they gave their whole attention to\r\nliterature, and afterwards employed themselves in the labours of the\r\ndistaff and the needle that thus they might chastely pass their virgin\r\nage. His sons were so educated, as, first, to have the completest\r\nbenefit of learning, that afterwards they might succeed to govern the\r\nstate, not like rustics, but philosophers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 912.] EDWARD.]\r\n\r\nCharles, the son-in-law of Edward, constrained thereto by Rollo,\r\nthrough a succession of calamities, conceded to him that part of Gaul\r\nwhich at present is called Normandy. It would be tedious to relate\r\nfor how many years, and with what audacity, the Normans disquieted\r\nevery place from the British ocean, as I have said, to the Tuscan sea.\r\nFirst Hasten, and then Rollo; who, born of noble lineage among the\r\nNorwegians, though obsolete from its extreme antiquity, was banished,\r\nby the king’s command, from his own country, and brought over with\r\nhim multitudes, who were in danger, either from debt or consciousness\r\nof guilt, and whom he had allured by great expectations of advantage.\r\nBetaking himself therefore to piracy, after his cruelty had raged\r\non every side at pleasure, he experienced a check at Chartres. For\r\nthe townspeople, relying neither on arms nor fortifications, piously\r\nimplored the assistance of the blessed Virgin Mary. The shift too of\r\nthe virgin, which Charles the Bald had brought with other relics from\r\nConstantinople, they displayed to the winds on the ramparts, thronged\r\nby the garrison, after the fashion of a banner. The enemy on seeing it\r\nbegan to laugh, and to direct their arrows at it. This, however, was\r\nnot done with impunity; for presently their eyes became dim, and they\r\ncould neither retreat nor advance. The townsmen, with joy perceiving\r\nthis, indulged themselves in a plentiful slaughter of them, as far\r\nas fortune permitted. Rollo, however, whom God reserved for the true\r\nfaith, escaped, and soon after gained Rouen and the neighbouring cities\r\nby force of arms, in the year of our Lord 876, and one year before\r\nthe death of Charles the Bald, whose grandson Lewis, as is before\r\nmentioned, vanquished the Normans, but did not expel them: but Charles,\r\nthe brother of that Lewis, grandson of Charles the Bald, by his son\r\nLewis, as I have said above, repeatedly experiencing, from unsuccessful\r\nconflicts, that fortune gave him nothing which she took from others,\r\nresolved, after consulting his nobility, that it was advisable to make\r\na show of royal munificence, when he was unable to repel injury; and,\r\nin a friendly manner, sent for Rollo. He was at this time far advanced\r\nin years; and, consequently, easily inclined to pacific measures. It\r\nwas therefore determined by treaty, that he should be baptized, and\r\nhold that country of the king as his lord. The inbred and untameable\r\nferocity of the man may well be imagined, for, on receiving this gift,\r\nas the by standers suggested to him, that he ought to kiss the foot of\r\nhis benefactor, disdaining to kneel down, he seized the king’s foot\r\nand dragged it to his mouth as he stood erect. The king falling on his\r\nback, the Normans began to laugh, and the Franks to be indignant; but\r\nRollo apologized for his shameful conduct, by saying that it was the\r\ncustom of his country. Thus the affair being settled, Rollo returned to\r\nRouen, and there died.\r\n\r\nThe son of this Charles was Lewis: he being challenged by one Isembard,\r\nthat had turned pagan, and renounced his faith, called upon his\r\nnobility for their assistance: they not even deigned an answer; when\r\none Hugh, son of Robert, earl of Mont Didier, a youth of no great\r\ncelebrity at the time, voluntarily entered the lists for his lord and\r\nkilled the challenger. Lewis, with his whole army pursuing to Ponthieu,\r\ngained there a glorious triumph; either destroying or putting to flight\r\nall the barbarians whom Isembard had brought with him. But not long\r\nafter, weakened by extreme sickness, the consequence of this laborious\r\nexpedition, he appointed this Hugh, a young man of noted faith and\r\ncourage, heir to the kingdom. Thus the lineage of Charles the Great\r\nceased with him, because either his wife was barren, or else did not\r\nlive long enough to have issue. Hugh married one of the daughters of\r\nEdward,[160] and begot Robert; Robert begot Henry; Henry, Philip; and\r\nPhilip, Lewis, who now reigns in France. But to return to our Edward:\r\nI think it will be pleasing to relate what in his time pope Formosus\r\ncommanded to be done with respect to filling up the bishoprics, which I\r\nshall insert in the very words I found it.[161]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 912.] POPE FORMOSUS.]\r\n\r\n“In the year of our Lord’s nativity 904, pope Formosus sent letters\r\ninto England, by which he denounced excommunication and malediction to\r\nking Edward and all his subjects, instead of the benediction which St.\r\nGregory had given to the English nation from the seat of St. Peter,\r\nbecause for seven whole years the entire district of the Gewissæ, that\r\nis, of the West-Saxons, had been destitute of bishops. On hearing\r\nthis, king Edward assembled a council of the senators of the English,\r\nover which presided Plegmund, archbishop of Canterbury, interpreting\r\ncarefully the words of the apostolic legation. Then the king and the\r\nbishops chose for themselves and their followers a salutary council,\r\nand, according to our Saviour’s words, ‘The harvest truly is plenteous,\r\nbut the labourers are few,’[162] they elected and appointed one bishop\r\nto every province of the Gewissæ, and that district which two formerly\r\npossessed they divided into five. The council being dissolved, the\r\narchbishop went to Rome with splendid presents, appeased the pope with\r\nmuch humility, and related the king’s ordinance, which gave the pontiff\r\ngreat satisfaction. Returning home, in one day he ordained in the city\r\nof Canterbury seven bishops to seven churches:--Frithstan to the church\r\nof Winchester; Athelstan to Cornwall; Werstan to Sherborne; Athelelm\r\nto Wells; Aidulf to Crediton in Devonshire: also to other provinces he\r\nappointed two bishops; to the South-Saxons, Bernegus, a very proper\r\nperson; and to the Mercians, Cenulph, whose see was at Dorchester, in\r\nOxfordshire. All this the pope established, in such wise, that he who\r\nshould invalidate this decree should be damned everlastingly.”\r\n\r\nEdward, going the way of all flesh, rested in the same monastery with\r\nhis father, which he had augmented with considerable revenues, and in\r\nwhich he had buried his brother Ethelward four years before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n_Of Athelstan, the son of Edward._ [A.D. 924-940.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 927.] ATHELSTAN.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord’s incarnation 924, Athelstan, the son of\r\nEdward, began to reign, and held the sovereignty sixteen years. His\r\nbrother, Ethelward, dying a few days after his father, had been buried\r\nwith him at Winchester. At this place, therefore, Athelstan, being\r\nelected king by the unanimous consent of the nobility, he was crowned\r\nat a royal town, which is called Kingston; though one Elfred, whose\r\ndeath we shall hereafter relate in the words of the king, with his\r\nfactious party, as sedition never wants adherents, attempted to prevent\r\nit. The ground of his opposition, as they affirm, was, that Athelstan\r\nwas born of a concubine. But having nothing ignoble in him, except\r\nthis stain, if after all it be true, he cast all his predecessors into\r\nthe shade by his piety, as well as the glory of all their triumphs, by\r\nthe splendour of his own. So much more excellent is it to have that\r\nfor which we are renowned inherent, than derived from our ancestors;\r\nbecause the former is exclusively our own, the latter is imputable to\r\nothers. I forbear relating how many new and magnificent monasteries\r\nhe founded; but I will not conceal that there was scarcely an old one\r\nin England which he did not embellish, either with buildings, or\r\nornaments, or books, or possessions. Thus he ennobled the new ones\r\nexpressly, but the old, as though they were only casual objects of his\r\nkindness. With Sihtric, king of the Northumbrians, who married, as\r\nI have before said, one of his sisters, he made a lasting covenant;\r\nhe dying after a year, Athelstan took that province under his own\r\ngovernment, expelling one Aldulph, who resisted him. And as a noble\r\nmind, when once roused, aspires to greater things, he compelled\r\nJothwel, king of all the Welsh, and Constantine, king of the Scots,\r\nto quit their kingdoms; but not long after, moved with commiseration,\r\nhe restored them to their original state, that they might reign under\r\nhim, saying, “it was more glorious to make than to be a king.” His last\r\ncontest was with Anlaf, the son of Sihtric, who, with the before-named\r\nConstantine, again in a state of rebellion, had entered his territories\r\nunder the hope of gaining the kingdom. Athelstan purposely retreating,\r\nthat he might derive greater honour from vanquishing his furious\r\nassailants, this bold youth, meditating unlawful conquests, had now\r\nproceeded far into England, when he was opposed at Bruneford[163] by\r\nthe most experienced generals, and most valiant forces. Perceiving,\r\nat length, what danger hung over him, he assumed the character of a\r\nspy. Laying aside his royal ensigns, and taking a harp in his hand,\r\nhe proceeded to our king’s tent: singing before the entrance, and at\r\ntimes touching the trembling strings in harmonious cadence, he was\r\nreadily admitted, professing himself a minstrel, who procured his\r\ndaily sustenance by such employment. Here he entertained the king and\r\nhis companions for some time with his musical performance, carefully\r\nexamining everything while occupied in singing. When satiety of eating\r\nhad put an end to their sensual enjoyments, and the business of war\r\nwas resumed among the nobles, he was ordered to depart, and received\r\nthe recompence of his song; but disdaining to take it away, he hid it\r\nbeneath him in the earth. This circumstance was remarked by a person,\r\nwho had formerly served under him, and immediately related it to\r\nAthelstan. The king, blaming him extremely for not having detected his\r\nenemy as he stood before them, received this answer: “The same oath,\r\nwhich I have lately sworn to you, O king, I formerly made to Anlaf; and\r\nhad you seen me violate it towards him, you might have expected similar\r\nperfidy towards yourself: but condescend to listen to the advice of\r\nyour servant, which is, that you should remove your tent hence, and\r\nremaining in another place till the residue of the army come up, you\r\nwill destroy your ferocious enemy by a moderate delay.” Approving\r\nthis admonition, he removed to another place. Anlaf advancing, well\r\nprepared, at night, put to death, together with the whole of his\r\nfollowers, a certain bishop,[164] who had joined the army only the\r\nevening before, and, ignorant of what had passed, had pitched his\r\ntent there on account of the level turf. Proceeding farther, he found\r\nthe king himself equally unprepared; who, little expecting his enemy\r\ncapable of such an attack, had indulged in profound repose. But, when\r\nroused from his sleep by the excessive tumult, and urging his people,\r\nas much as the darkness of the night would permit, to the conflict, his\r\nsword fell by chance from the sheath; upon which, while all things were\r\nfilled with dread and blind confusion, he invoked the protection of God\r\nand of St. Aldhelm, who was distantly related to him; and replacing his\r\nhand upon the scabbard, he there found a sword, which is kept to this\r\nday, on account of the miracle, in the treasury of the kings. Moreover,\r\nit is, as they say, chased in one part, but can never be inlaid either\r\nwith gold or silver. Confiding in this divine present, and at the same\r\ntime, as it began to dawn, attacking the Norwegian, he continued the\r\nbattle unwearied through the day, and put him to flight with his whole\r\narmy. There fell Constantine, king of the Scots, a man of treacherous\r\nenergy and vigorous old age; five other kings, twelve earls, and almost\r\nthe whole assemblage of barbarians. The few who escaped were preserved\r\nto embrace the faith of Christ.\r\n\r\nConcerning this king a strong persuasion is prevalent among the\r\nEnglish, that one more just or learned never governed the kingdom.\r\nThat he was versed in literature, I discovered a few days since, in a\r\ncertain old volume, wherein the writer struggles with the difficulty of\r\nthe task, unable to express his meaning as he wished. Indeed I would\r\nsubjoin his words for brevity’s sake, were they not extravagant beyond\r\nbelief in the praises of the king, and just in that style of writing\r\nwhich Cicero, the prince of Roman eloquence, in his book on Rhetoric,\r\ndenominates “bombast.” The custom of that time excuses the diction, and\r\nthe affection for Athelstan, who was yet living, gave countenance to\r\nthe excess of praise. I shall subjoin, therefore, in familiar language,\r\nsome few circumstances which may tend to augment his reputation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 924.] ATHELSTAN.]\r\n\r\nKing Edward, after many noble exploits, both in war and peace, a few\r\ndays before his death subdued the contumacy of the city of Chester,\r\nwhich was rebelling in confederacy with the Britons; and placing a\r\ngarrison there, he fell sick and died at Faringdon, and was buried,\r\nas I before related, at Winchester. Athelstan, as his father had\r\ncommanded in his will, was then hailed king, recommended by his\r\nyears,--for he was now thirty,--and the maturity of his wisdom. For\r\neven his grandfather Alfred, seeing and embracing him affectionately\r\nwhen he was a boy of astonishing beauty and graceful manners, had\r\nmost devoutly prayed that his government might be prosperous: indeed,\r\nhe had made him a knight[165] unusually early, giving him a scarlet\r\ncloak, a belt studded with diamonds, and a Saxon sword with a golden\r\nscabbard. Next he had provided that he should be educated in the court\r\nof Ethelfled his daughter, and of his son-in-law Ethered; so that,\r\nhaving been brought up in expectation of succeeding to the kingdom, by\r\nthe tender care of his aunt and of this celebrated prince, he repressed\r\nand destroyed all envy by the lustre of his good qualities; and, after\r\nthe death of his father, and decease of his brother, he was crowned at\r\nKingston. Hence, to celebrate such splendid events, and the joy of that\r\nillustrious day, the poet justly exclaims:\r\n\r\n    Of royal race a noble stem\r\n  Hath chased our darkness like a gem.\r\n  Great Athelstan, his country’s pride,\r\n  Whose virtue never turns aside;\r\n  Sent by his father to the schools,\r\n  Patient, he bore their rigid rules,\r\n  And drinking deep of science mild,\r\n  Passed his first years unlike a child.\r\n  Next clothed in youth’s bewitching charms,\r\n  Studied the harsher lore of arms,\r\n  Which soon confessed his knowledge keen,\r\n  As after in the sovereign seen.\r\n  Soon as his father, good and great,\r\n  Yielded, though ever famed, to fate,\r\n  The youth was called the realm to guide,\r\n  And, like his parent, well preside.\r\n  The nobles meet, the crown present,\r\n  On rebels, prelates curses vent;\r\n  The people light the festive fires,\r\n  And show by turns their kind desires.\r\n  Their deeds their loyalty declare,\r\n  Though hopes and fears their bosoms share.\r\n  With festive treat the court abounds;\r\n  Foams the brisk wine, the hall resounds:\r\n  The pages run, the servants haste,\r\n  And food and verse regale the taste.\r\n  The minstrels sing, the guests commend,\r\n  Whilst all in praise to Christ contend.\r\n  The king with pleasure all things sees,\r\n  And all his kind attentions please.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 926.] ATHELSTAN.]\r\n\r\nThe solemnity of the consecration being finished, Athelstan, that he\r\nmight not deceive the expectation of his subjects, and fall below\r\ntheir opinion, subdued the whole of England, except Northumbria, by\r\nthe single terror of his name. One Sihtric, a relation of that Gothrun\r\nwho is mentioned in the history of Alfred, presided over this people,\r\na barbarian both by race and disposition, who, though he ridiculed the\r\npower of preceding kings, humbly solicited affinity with Athelstan,\r\nsending messengers expressly for the purpose; and himself shortly\r\nfollowing confirmed the proposals of the ambassadors. In consequence,\r\nhonoured by a union with his sister, and by various presents, he laid\r\nthe basis of a perpetual treaty. But, as I have before observed, dying\r\nat the end of a year, he afforded Athelstan an opportunity for uniting\r\nNorthumbria, which belonged to him both by ancient right and recent\r\naffinity, to his sovereignty. Anlaf, the son of Sihtric, then fled\r\ninto Ireland, and his brother Guthferth into Scotland. Messengers\r\nfrom the king immediately followed to Constantine, king of the Scots,\r\nand Eugenius, king of the Cumbrians, claiming the fugitive under a\r\nthreat of war. The barbarians had no idea of resistance, but without\r\ndelay coming to a place called Dacor, they surrendered themselves and\r\ntheir kingdoms to the sovereign of England. Out of regard to this\r\ntreaty, the king himself stood for the son of Constantine, who was\r\nordered to be baptized, at the sacred font. Guthferth, however, amid\r\nthe preparations for the journey, escaped by flight with one Turfrid,\r\na leader of the opposite party; and afterwards laying siege to York,\r\nwhere he could succeed in bringing the townsmen to surrender neither\r\nby entreaties nor by threats, he departed. Not long after, being both\r\nshut up in a castle, they eluded the vigilance of the guards, and\r\nescaped. Turfrid, losing his life quickly after by shipwreck, became a\r\nprey to fishes. Guthferth, suffering extremely both by sea and land, at\r\nlast came a suppliant to court. Being amicably received by the king,\r\nand sumptuously entertained for four days, he resought his ships; an\r\nincorrigible pirate, and accustomed to live in the water like a fish.\r\nIn the meantime Athelstan levelled with the ground the castle which the\r\nDanes had formerly fortified in York, that there might be no place for\r\ndisloyalty to shelter in; and the booty which had been found there,\r\nwhich was very considerable, he generously divided, man by man, to\r\nthe whole army. For he had prescribed himself this rule of conduct,\r\nnever to hoard up riches; but liberally to expend all his acquisition\r\neither on monasteries or on his faithful followers. On these, during\r\nthe whole of his life, he expended his paternal treasures, as well as\r\nthe produce of his victories. To the clergy he was humble and affable;\r\nto the laity mild and pleasant; to the nobility rather reserved,\r\nfrom respect to his dignity; to the lower classes, laying aside the\r\nstateliness of power, he was kind and condescending. He was, as we have\r\nheard, of becoming stature, thin in person, his hair flaxen, as I have\r\nseen by his remains, and beautifully wreathed with golden threads.\r\nExtremely beloved by his subjects from admiration of his fortitude and\r\nhumility, he was terrible to those who rebelled against him, through\r\nhis invincible courage. He compelled the rulers of the northern Welsh,\r\nthat is, of the North Britons, to meet him at the city of Hereford, and\r\nafter some opposition to surrender to his power. So that he actually\r\nbrought to pass what no king before him had even presumed to think of:\r\nwhich was, that they should pay annually by way of tribute, twenty\r\npounds of gold, three hundred of silver, twenty-five thousand oxen,\r\nbesides as many dogs as he might choose, which from their sagacious\r\nscent could discover the retreats and hiding places of wild beasts; and\r\nbirds, trained to make prey of others in the air. Departing thence, he\r\nturned towards the Western Britons, who are called the Cornwallish,\r\nbecause, situated in the west of Britain, they are opposite to the\r\nextremity of Gaul.[166] Fiercely attacking, he obliged them to retreat\r\nfrom Exeter, which, till that time, they had inhabited with equal\r\nprivileges with the Angles, fixing the boundary of their province on\r\nthe other side of the river Tamar, as he had appointed the river Wye to\r\nthe North Britons. This city then, which he had cleansed by purging it\r\nof its contaminated race, he fortified with towers and surrounded with\r\na wall of squared stone. And, though the barren and unfruitful soil\r\ncan scarcely produce indifferent oats, and frequently only the empty\r\nhusk without the grain, yet, owing to the magnificence of the city,\r\nthe opulence of its inhabitants, and the constant resort of strangers,\r\nevery kind of merchandise is there so abundant that nothing is wanting\r\nwhich can conduce to human comfort. Many noble traces of him are to\r\nbe seen in that city, as well as in the neighbouring district, which\r\nwill be better described by the conversation of the natives, than by my\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\nOn this account all Europe resounded with his praises, and extolled his\r\nvalour to the skies: foreign princes with justice esteemed themselves\r\nhappy if they could purchase his friendship either by affinity or by\r\npresents. Harold king of Norway sent him a ship with golden beak and a\r\npurple sail, furnished within with a compacted fence of gilded shields.\r\nThe names of the persons sent with it, were Helgrim and Offrid: who,\r\nbeing received with princely magnificence in the city of York, were\r\namply compensated, by rich presents, for the labour of their journey.\r\nHenry the First, for there were many of the name, the son of Conrad,\r\nking of the Teutonians and emperor of the Romans, demanded his sister,\r\nas I have before related, for his son Otho: passing over so many\r\nneighbouring kings, but contemplating from a distance Athelstan’s noble\r\ndescent, and greatness of mind. So completely indeed had these two\r\nqualities taken up their abode with him, that none could be more noble\r\nor illustrious in descent; none more bold or prompt in disposition.\r\nMaturely considering that he had four sisters, who were all equally\r\nbeautiful, except only as their ages made a difference, he sent two to\r\nthe emperor at his request; and how he disposed of them in marriage\r\nhas already been related: Lewis prince of Aquitania, a descendant\r\nof Charles the Great, obtained the third in wedlock: the fourth, in\r\nwhom the whole essence of beauty had centred, which the others only\r\npossessed in part, was demanded from her brother by Hugh king of the\r\nFranks.[167] The chief of this embassy was Adulph, son of Baldwin earl\r\nof Flanders by Ethelswitha daughter of king Edward.[168] When he had\r\ndeclared the request of the suitor in an assembly of the nobility at\r\nAbingdon, he produced such liberal presents as might gratify the most\r\nboundless avarice: perfumes such as never had been seen in England\r\nbefore: jewels, but more especially emeralds, the greenness of which,\r\nreflected by the sun, illumined the countenances of the by-standers\r\nwith agreeable light: many fleet horses with their trappings, and,\r\nas Virgil says, “Champing their golden bits:” an alabaster vase so\r\nexquisitely chased, that, the cornfields really seemed to wave, the\r\nvines to bud, the figures of men actually to move, and so clear and\r\npolished, that it reflected the features like a mirror; the sword of\r\nConstantine the Great, on which the name of its original possessor\r\nwas read in golden letters; on the pommel, upon thick plates of gold,\r\nmight be seen fixed an iron spike, one of the four which the Jewish\r\nfaction prepared for the crucifixion of our Lord: the spear of Charles\r\nthe Great, which whenever that invincible emperor hurled in his\r\nexpeditions against the Saracens, he always came off conqueror; it was\r\nreported to be the same, which, driven into the side of our Saviour by\r\nthe hand of the centurion,[169] opened, by that precious wound, the\r\njoys of paradise to wretched mortals: the banner of the most blessed\r\nmartyr Maurice, chief of the Theban legion;[170] with which the same\r\nking, in the Spanish war, used to break through the battalions of the\r\nenemy however fierce and wedged together, and put them to flight: a\r\ndiadem, precious from its quantity of gold, but more so for its jewels,\r\nthe splendour of which threw the sparks of light so strongly on the\r\nbeholders, that the more stedfastly any person endeavoured to gaze, so\r\nmuch the more he was dazzled, and compelled to avert his eyes; part\r\nof the holy and adorable cross enclosed in crystal; where the eye,\r\npiercing through the substance of the stone, might discern the colour\r\nand size of the wood; a small portion of the crown of thorns, enclosed\r\nin a similar manner, which, in derision of his government, the madness\r\nof the soldiers placed on Christ’s sacred head. The king, delighted\r\nwith such great and exquisite presents, made an equal return of good\r\noffices; and gratified the soul of the longing suitor by a union with\r\nhis sister. With some of these presents he enriched succeeding kings:\r\nbut to Malmesbury he gave part of the cross and crown; by the support\r\nof which, I believe, that place even now flourishes, though it has\r\nsuffered so many shipwrecks of its liberty, so many attacks of its\r\nenemies.[171] In this place he ordered Elwin and Ethelwin, the sons of\r\nhis uncle Ethelward, whom he had lost in the battle against Anlaf, to\r\nbe honourably buried, expressing his design of resting here himself: of\r\nwhich battle it is now proper time to give the account of that poet,\r\nfrom whom I have taken all these transactions.\r\n\r\n  His subjects governing with justest sway,\r\n  Tyrants o’eraw’d, twelve years had pass’d away,\r\n  When Europe’s noxious pestilence stalk’d forth,\r\n  And poured the barbarous legions from the north.\r\n  The pirate Anlaf now the briny surge\r\n  Forsakes, while deeds of desperation urge.\r\n  Her king consenting, Scotia’s land receives\r\n  The frantic madman, and his host of thieves:\r\n  Now flush’d with insolence they shout and boast,\r\n  And drive the harmless natives from the coast.\r\n  Thus, while the king, secure in youthful pride,\r\n  Bade the soft hours in gentle pleasures glide,\r\n  Though erst he stemmed the battle’s furious tide,\r\n  With ceaseless plunder sped the daring horde,\r\n  And wasted districts with their fire and sword.\r\n  The verdant crops lay withering on the fields\r\n  The glebe no promise to the rustic yields.\r\n  Immense the numbers of barbarian force,\r\n  Countless the squadrons both of foot and horse.\r\n  At length fame’s rueful moan alarmed the king,\r\n  And bade him shun this ignominious sting,\r\n  That arms like his to ruffian bands should bend:\r\n  ’Tis done: delays and hesitations end.\r\n  High in the air the threatening banners fly,\r\n  And call his eager troops to victory,\r\n  His hardy force, a hundred thousand strong\r\n  Whom standards hasten to the fight along.\r\n  The martial clamour scares the plund’ring band,\r\n  And drives them bootless tow’rds their native land.\r\n  The vulgar mass a dreadful carnage share,\r\n  And shed contagion on the ambient air,\r\n  While Anlaf, only, out of all the crew\r\n  Escapes the meed of death, so justly due,\r\n  Reserved by fortune’s favor, once again\r\n  When Athelstan was dead, to claim our strain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 937.] DEATH OF ELFRED.]\r\n\r\nThis place seems to require that I should relate the death of Elfred\r\nin the words of the king, for which I before pledged the faith of my\r\nnarrative. For as he had commanded the bodies of his relations to be\r\nconveyed to Malmesbury, and interred at the head of the sepulchre of\r\nSt. Aldhelm; he honoured the place afterwards to such a degree, that\r\nhe esteemed none more desirable or more holy. Bestowing many large\r\nestates upon it, he confirmed them by charters, in one of which, after\r\nthe donation, he adds: “Be it known to the sages of our kingdom, that\r\nI have not unjustly seized the lands aforesaid, or dedicated plunder\r\nto God; but that I have received them, as the English nobility, and\r\neven John, the pope of the church of Rome himself, have judged fitting\r\non the death of Elfred. He was the jealous rival both of my happiness\r\nand life, and consented to the wickedness of my enemies, who, on my\r\nfather’s decease, had not God in his mercy delivered me, wished to put\r\nout my eyes in the city of Winchester: wherefore, on the discovery\r\nof their infernal contrivances, he was sent to the church of Rome to\r\ndefend himself by oath before pope John. This he did at the altar of\r\nSt. Peter; but at the very instant he had sworn, he fell down before\r\nit, and was carried by his servants to the English School, where he\r\ndied the third night after. The pope immediately sent to consult\r\nwith us, whether his body should be placed among other Christians.\r\nOn receiving this account the nobility of our kingdom, with the\r\nwhole body of his relations, humbly entreated that we would grant\r\nour permission for his remains to be buried with other Christians.\r\nConsenting, therefore, to their urgent request, we sent back our\r\ncompliance to Rome, and with the pope’s permission he was buried,\r\nthough unworthy, with other Christians. In consequence all his property\r\nof every description was adjudged to be mine. Moreover, we have noted\r\nthis in writing, that, so long as Christianity reigns, it may never be\r\nabrogated, whence the aforesaid land, which I have given to God and St.\r\nPeter, was granted me; nor do I know any thing more just, than that\r\nI should bestow this gift on God and St. Peter, who caused my rival\r\nto fall in the sight of all persons, and conferred on me a prosperous\r\nreign.”\r\n\r\nIn these words of the king, we may equally venerate his wisdom, and\r\nhis piety in sacred matters: his wisdom, that so young a man should\r\nperceive that a sacrifice obtained by rapine could not be acceptable\r\nto God: his piety in so gratefully making a return to God, out of a\r\nbenefit conferred on him by divine vengeance. Moreover, it may be\r\nnecessary to observe, that at that time the church of St. Peter was the\r\nchief of the monastery, which now is deemed second only: the church of\r\nSt. Mary, which the monks at present frequent, was built afterwards in\r\nthe time of king Edgar, under abbat Elfric. Thus far relating to the\r\nking I have written from authentic testimony: that which follows I have\r\nlearned more from old ballads, popular through succeeding times, than\r\nfrom books written expressly for the information of posterity. I have\r\nsubjoined them, not to defend their veracity, but to put my reader in\r\npossession of all I know. First, then, to the relation of his birth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 926.] BIRTH OF ATHELSTAN.]\r\n\r\nThere was in a certain village, a shepherd’s daughter, a girl of\r\nexquisite beauty, who gained through the elegance of her person what\r\nher birth could never have bestowed. In a vision she beheld a prodigy:\r\nthe moon shone from her womb, and all England was illuminated by the\r\nlight. When she sportively related this to her companions in the\r\nmorning, it was not so lightly received, but immediately reached the\r\nears of the woman who had nursed the sons of the king. Deliberating on\r\nthis matter, she took her home and adopted her as a daughter, bringing\r\nup this young maiden with costlier attire, more delicate food, and\r\nmore elegant demeanour. Soon after, Edward, the son of king Alfred,\r\ntravelling through the village, stopped at the house which had been\r\nthe scene of his infantine education. Indeed, he thought it would be a\r\nblemish on his reputation to omit paying his salutations to his nurse.\r\nHe became deeply enamoured of the young woman from the first moment he\r\nsaw her, and passed the night with her. In consequence of this single\r\nintercourse, she brought forth her son Athelstan, and so realized her\r\ndream. For at the expiration of his childish years, as he approached\r\nmanhood, he gave proof by many actions what just expectations of noble\r\nqualities might be entertained of him. King Edward, therefore, died,\r\nand was shortly followed by his legitimate son Ethelward. All hopes\r\nnow centred in Athelstan: Elfred alone, a man of uncommon insolence,\r\ndisdaining to be governed by a sovereign whom he had not voluntarily\r\nchosen, secretly opposed with his party to the very utmost. But he\r\nbeing detected and punished, as the king has before related, there\r\nwere some who even accused Edwin, the king’s brother, of treachery.\r\nBase and dreadful crime was it thus to embroil fraternal affection by\r\nsinister constructions. Edwin, though imploring, both personally and\r\nby messengers, the confidence of his brother, and though invalidating\r\nthe accusation by an oath, was nevertheless driven into exile. So far,\r\nindeed, did the dark suggestions of some persons prevail on a mind\r\ndistracted with various cares, that, forgetful of a brother’s love,\r\nhe expelled the youth, an object of pity even to strangers. The mode\r\nadopted too was cruel in the extreme: he was compelled to go on board\r\na vessel, with a single attendant, without a rower, without even an\r\noar, and the bark crazy with age. Fortune laboured for a long time\r\nto restore the innocent youth to land, but when at length he was far\r\nout at sea, and sails could not endure the violence of the wind, the\r\nyoung man, delicate, and weary of life under such circumstances, put\r\nan end to his existence by a voluntary plunge into the waters. The\r\nattendant wisely determining to prolong his life, sometimes by shunning\r\nthe hostile waves, and sometimes by urging the boat forward with his\r\nfeet, brought his master’s body to land, in the narrow sea which\r\nflows between Wissant and Dover. Athelstan, when his anger cooled,\r\nand his mind became calm, shuddered at the deed, and submitting to a\r\nseven years’ penance, inflicted severe vengeance on the accuser of\r\nhis brother: he was the king’s cup-bearer, and on this account had\r\nopportunity of enforcing his insinuations. It so happened on a festive\r\nday, as he was serving wine, that slipping with one foot in the midst\r\nof the chamber, he recovered himself with the other. On this occasion,\r\nhe made use of an expression which proved his destruction: “Thus\r\nbrother,” said he, “assists brother.” The king on hearing this, ordered\r\nthe faithless wretch to be put to death, loudly reproaching him with\r\nthe loss of that assistance he might have had from his brother, were he\r\nalive, and bewailing his death.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of Edwin’s death, though extremely probable, I the\r\nless venture to affirm for truth, on account of the extraordinary\r\naffection he manifested towards the rest of his brothers; for, as his\r\nfather had left them very young, he cherished them whilst children with\r\nmuch kindness, and, when grown up, made them partakers of his kingdom;\r\nit is before related to what dignity he exalted such of his sisters\r\nas his father had left unmarried and unprovided for. Completing his\r\nearthly course, and that a short one, Athelstan died at Gloucester.\r\nHis noble remains were conveyed to Malmesbury and buried under the\r\naltar. Many gifts, both in gold and silver, as well as relics of\r\nsaints purchased abroad in Brittany, were carried before the body:\r\nfor, in such things, admonished, as they say, in a dream, he expended\r\nthe treasures which his father had long since amassed, and had left\r\nuntouched. His years, though few, were full of glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\n_Of kings Edmund, Edred, and Edwy._ [A.D. 940-955.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 940-944.] KING EDMUND.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord’s incarnation 940, Edmund the brother of\r\nAthelstan, a youth of about eighteen, received and held the government\r\nfor six years and a half. In his time the Northumbrians, meditating a\r\nrenewal of hostilities, violated the treaty which they had made with\r\nAthelstan, and created Anlaf, whom they had recalled from Ireland,\r\ntheir king. Edmund, who thought it disgraceful not to complete his\r\nbrother’s victorious course, led his troops against the delinquents;\r\nwho presently retreating, he subjugated all the cities on this side the\r\nriver Humber. Anlaf, with a certain prince, Reginald,[172] the son of\r\nthat Gurmund of whom we have spoken in the history of Alfred, sounding\r\nthe disposition of the king, offered to surrender himself, proffering\r\nhis conversion to Christianity as a pledge of his fidelity, and\r\nreceiving baptism. His savage nature, however, did not let him remain\r\nlong in this resolution, for he violated his oath, and irritated his\r\nlord. In consequence of which, the following year he suffered for his\r\ncrimes, being doomed to perpetual exile. The province which is called\r\nCumberland Edmund assigned to Malcolm, king of the Scots, under fealty\r\nof an oath.\r\n\r\nAmong the many donations which the king conferred on different\r\nchurches, he exalted that of Glastonbury, through his singular\r\naffection towards it, with great estates and honours; and granted it a\r\ncharter in these words:\r\n\r\n“In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I Edmund, king of the Angles,\r\nand governor and ruler of the other surrounding nations, with the\r\nadvice and consent of my nobility, for the hope of eternal retribution,\r\nand remission of my transgressions, do grant to the church of the holy\r\nmother of God, Mary of Glastonbury, and the venerable Dunstan, whom I\r\nhave there constituted abbat, the franchise and jurisdiction, rights,\r\ncustoms, and all the forfeitures of all their possessions; that is\r\nto say,[173] burhgeritha, and hundred-setena, athas and ordelas, and\r\ninfangenetheofas, hamsocne, and fridebrice, and forestel and toll, and\r\nteam, throughout my kingdom, and their lands shall be free to them, and\r\nreleased from all exactions, as my own are. But more especially shall\r\nthe town of Glastonbury, in which is situated that most ancient church\r\nof the holy mother of God, together with its bounds, be more free than\r\nother places. The abbat of this place, alone, shall have power, as\r\nwell in causes known as unknown; in small and in great; and even in\r\nthose which are above, and under the earth; on dry land, and in the\r\nwater; in woods and in plains; and he shall have the same authority of\r\npunishing or remitting the crimes of delinquents perpetrated within it,\r\nas my court has; in the same manner as my predecessors have granted and\r\nconfirmed by charter; to wit, Edward my father, and Elfred his father,\r\nand Kentwin, Ina, and Cuthred, and many others, who more peculiarly\r\nhonoured and esteemed that noble place. And that any one, either\r\nbishop, or duke,[174] or prince, or any of their servants, should dare\r\nto enter it for the purpose of holding courts, or distraining, or doing\r\nany thing contrary to the will of the servants of God there, I inhibit\r\nunder God’s curse. Whosoever therefore shall benevolently augment my\r\ndonation, may his life be prosperous in this present world; long may he\r\nenjoy his happiness: but whosoever shall presume to invade it through\r\nhis own rashness, let him know for certain that he shall be compelled\r\nwith fear and trembling to give account before the tribunal of a\r\nrigorous judge, unless he shall first atone for his offence by proper\r\nsatisfaction.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 946.] EDMUND KILLED.]\r\n\r\nThe aforesaid donation was granted in the year of our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist’s incarnation 944, in the first of the indiction, and was\r\nwritten in letters of gold in the book of the Gospels, which he\r\npresented to the same church elegantly adorned. Such great and\r\nprosperous successes, however, were obscured by a melancholy death.\r\nA certain robber named Leofa, whom he had banished for his crimes,\r\nreturning after six years’ absence totally unexpected, was sitting,\r\non the feast of St. Augustine, the apostle of the English, and first\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, among the royal guests at Puckle-church,[175]\r\nfor on this day the English were wont to regale in commemoration of\r\ntheir first preacher; by chance too, he was placed near a nobleman whom\r\nthe king had condescended to make his guest. This, while the others\r\nwere eagerly carousing, was perceived by the king alone; when, hurried\r\nwith indignation and impelled by fate, he leaped from the table, caught\r\nthe robber by the hair, and dragged him to the floor; but he secretly\r\ndrawing a dagger from its sheath plunged it with all his force into the\r\nbreast of the king as he lay upon him. Dying of the wound, he gave rise\r\nover the whole kingdom to many fictions concerning his decease. The\r\nrobber was shortly torn limb from limb by the attendants who rushed in,\r\nthough he wounded some of them ere they could accomplish their purpose.\r\nSt. Dunstan, at that time abbat of Glastonbury, had foreseen his\r\nignoble end, being fully persuaded of it from the gesticulations and\r\ninsolent mockery of a devil dancing before him. Wherefore, hastening\r\nto court at full speed, he received intelligence of the transaction\r\non the road. By common consent then it was determined, that his body\r\nshould be brought to Glastonbury and there magnificently buried in\r\nthe northern part of the tower. That such had been his intention,\r\nthrough his singular regard for the abbat, was evident from particular\r\ncircumstances. The village also where he was murdered was made an\r\noffering for the dead, that the spot which had witnessed his fall might\r\never after minister aid to his soul.\r\n\r\nIn his fourth year, that is, in the year of our Lord 944, William, the\r\nson of Rollo, duke of Normandy, was treacherously killed in France,\r\nwhich old writers relate as having been done with some degree of\r\njustice. Rinulph, one of the Norman nobility, owing William a grudge\r\nfrom some unknown cause, harassed him with perpetual aggressions.\r\nHis son, Anschetil, who served under the earl, to gratify his lord\r\ndurst offer violence to nature for taking his father in battle: he\r\ndelivered him into the power of the earl, relying on the most solemn\r\noath, that he should suffer nothing beyond imprisonment. As wickedness,\r\nhowever, constantly discovers pretences for crime, the earl, shortly\r\nafter feigning an excuse, sends Anschetil to Pavia bearing a letter\r\nto the duke of Italy, the purport of which was his own destruction.\r\nCompleting his journey, he was received, on his entrance into the\r\ncity, in the most respectful manner; and delivering the letter, the\r\nduke, astonished at the treachery, shuddered, that a warrior of such\r\nsingular address should be ordered to be despatched. But as he would\r\nnot oppose the request of so renowned a nobleman, he laid an ambush\r\nof a thousand horsemen, as it is said, for Anschetil when he left\r\nthe city. For a long time, with his companions whom he had selected\r\nout of all Normandy, he resisted their attack; but at last he fell\r\nnobly, compensating his own death by slaying many of the enemy. The\r\nonly survivor on either side was Balso, a Norman, a man of small size,\r\nbut of incredible courage; although some say that he was ironically\r\ncalled short. This man, I say, alone hovered round the city, and by his\r\nsingle sword terrified the townspeople as long as he thought proper.\r\nNo person will deem this incredible, who considers what efforts the\r\ndesperation of a courageous man will produce, and how little military\r\nvalour the people of that region possess. Returning thence to his own\r\ncountry, he laid his complaint of the perfidy of his lord before the\r\nking of France. Fame reported too, that Rinulph, in addition to his\r\nchains, had had his eyes put out. In consequence the earl being cited\r\nto his trial at Paris, was met, under the pretence of a conference,\r\nas they assert, and killed by Balso; thus making atonement for his\r\nown perfidy, and satisfying the rage of his antagonist in the midst\r\nof the river Seine. His death was the source of long discord between\r\nthe French and Normans, till by the exertions of Richard his son it\r\nhad a termination worthy such a personage. A truer history[176] indeed\r\nrelates, that being at enmity with Ernulph, earl of Flanders, he had\r\npossessed himself of one of his castles, and that being invited out\r\nby him to a conference, on a pretended design of making a truce, he\r\nwas killed by Balso, as they were conversing in a ship: that a key was\r\nfound at his girdle, which being applied to the lock of his private\r\ncabinet, discovered certain monastic habiliments;[177] for he ever\r\ndesigned, even amid his warlike pursuits, one day to become a monk at\r\nJumiéges; which place, deserted from the time of Hasten, he cleared of\r\nthe overspreading thorns, and with princely magnificence exalted to its\r\npresent state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 946-955.] EDRED--EDWY.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 946, Edred, Edward’s third son, assuming the\r\ngovernment, reigned nine years and a half. He gave proof that he had\r\nnot degenerated in greatness of soul from his father and his brothers;\r\nfor he nearly exterminated the Northumbrians and the Scots, laying\r\nwaste the whole province with sword and famine, because, having with\r\nlittle difficulty compelled them to swear fidelity to him, they broke\r\ntheir oath, and made Iricius their king. He for a long time kept\r\nWulstan, archbishop of York, who, it was said, connived at the revolt\r\nof his countrymen, in chains, but afterwards, out of respect to his\r\necclesiastical dignity, released and pardoned him. In the meantime, the\r\nking himself, prostrate at the feet of the saints, devoted his life to\r\nGod and to Dunstan, by whose admonition he endured with patience his\r\nfrequent bodily pains,[178] prolonged his prayers, and made his palace\r\naltogether the school of virtue. He died accompanied with the utmost\r\ngrief of men, but joy of angels; for Dunstan, learning by a messenger\r\nthat he was sick, while urging his horse in order to see him, heard a\r\nvoice thundering over his head, “Now king Edred sleeps in the Lord.” He\r\nlies buried in the cathedral at Winchester.\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 955, Edwy, son of Edmund, the brother of\r\nAthelstan the former king, taking possession of the kingdom, retained\r\nit four years: a wanton youth, who abused the beauty of his person\r\nin illicit intercourse. Finally, taking a woman nearly related to\r\nhim as his wife, he doated on her beauty, and despised the advice\r\nof his counsellors. On the very day he had been consecrated king,\r\nin full assembly of the nobility, when deliberating on affairs of\r\nimportance and essential to the state, he burst suddenly from amongst\r\nthem, darted wantonly into his chamber, and rioted in the embraces of\r\nthe harlot. All were indignant of the shameless deed, and murmured\r\namong themselves. Dunstan alone, with that firmness which his name\r\nimplies,[179] regardless of the royal indignation, violently dragged\r\nthe lascivious boy from the chamber, and on the archbishop’s compelling\r\nhim to repudiate the strumpet,[180] made him his enemy for ever. Soon\r\nafter, upheld by most contemptible supporters, he afflicted with\r\nundeserved calamities all the members of the monastic order throughout\r\nEngland,--who were first despoiled of their property, and then driven\r\ninto exile. He drove Dunstan himself, the chief of monks, into\r\nFlanders. At that time the face of monachism was sad and pitiable. Even\r\nthe monastery of Malmesbury, which had been inhabited by monks for more\r\nthan two hundred and seventy years, he made a sty for secular canons.\r\nBut thou, O Lord Jesus, our creator and redeemer, gracious disposer,\r\nart abundantly able to remedy our defects by means of those irregular\r\nand vagabond men. Thou didst bring to light thy treasure, hidden for\r\nso many years--I mean the body of St. Aldhelm, which they took up and\r\nplaced in a shrine. The royal generosity increased the fame of the\r\ncanons; for the king bestowed on the saint an estate, very convenient\r\nboth from its size and vicinity. But my recollection shudders even at\r\nthis time, to think how cruel he was to other monasteries, equally\r\non account of the giddiness of youth, and the pernicious counsel of\r\nhis concubine, who was perpetually poisoning his uninformed mind.\r\nBut let his soul, long since placed in rest by the interposition of\r\nDunstan,[181] pardon my grief: grief, I say, compels me to condemn\r\nhim, “because private advantage is not to be preferred to public loss,\r\nbut rather public loss should outweigh private advantage.” He paid the\r\npenalty of his rash attempt even in this life, being despoiled of the\r\ngreatest part of his kingdom;[182] shocked with which calamity, he\r\ndied, and was buried in the new minster at Winchester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\n_Of king Edgar, son of king Edmund._ [A.D. 959-975.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 959-975.] OF KING EDGAR.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord’s incarnation 959, Edgar, the honour and\r\ndelight of the English, the son of Edmund, the brother of Edwy, a\r\nyouth of sixteen years old, assuming the government, held it for\r\nabout a similar period. The transactions of his reign are celebrated\r\nwith peculiar splendour even in our times. The Divine love, which\r\nhe sedulously procured by his devotion and energy of counsel, shone\r\npropitious on his years. It is commonly reported, that at his birth\r\nDunstan heard an angelic voice, saying, “Peace to England so long as\r\nthis child shall reign, and our Dunstan survives.” The succession of\r\nevents was in unison with the heavenly oracle; so much while he lived\r\ndid ecclesiastical glory flourish, and martial clamour decay. Scarcely\r\ndoes a year elapse in the chronicles, in which he did not perform\r\nsomething great and advantageous to his country; in which he did not\r\nbuild some new monastery. He experienced no internal treachery, no\r\nforeign attack. Kinad, king of the Scots, Malcolm, of the Cambrians,\r\nthat prince of pirates, Maccus, all the Welsh kings, whose names were\r\nDufnal, Giferth, Huval, Jacob, Judethil, being summoned to his court,\r\nwere bound to him by one, and that a lasting oath; so that meeting him\r\nat Chester, he exhibited them on the river Dee in triumphal ceremony.\r\nFor putting them all on board the same vessels he compelled them to\r\nrow him as he sat at the prow: thus displaying his regal magnificence,\r\nwho held so many kings in subjection. Indeed, he is reported to have\r\nsaid, that henceforward his successors might truly boast of being\r\nkings of England, since they would enjoy so singular an honour. Hence\r\nhis fame being noised abroad, foreigners, Saxons, Flemings, and even\r\nDanes, frequently sailed hither, and were on terms of intimacy with\r\nEdgar, though their arrival was highly prejudicial to the natives: for\r\nfrom the Saxons they learned an untameable ferocity of mind; from the\r\nFlemings an unmanly delicacy of body; and from the Danes drunkenness;\r\nthough they were before free from such propensities, and disposed to\r\nobserve their own customs with native simplicity rather than admire\r\nthose of others. For this history justly and deservedly blames him; for\r\nthe other imputations which I shall mention hereafter have rather been\r\ncast on him by ballads.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 973.] KING EDGAR’S REFORMS.]\r\n\r\nAt this time the light of holy men was so resplendent in England, that\r\nyou would believe the very stars from heaven smiled upon it. Among\r\nthese was Dunstan, whom I have mentioned so frequently, first, abbat\r\nof Glastonbury; next, bishop of Worcester; and lastly, archbishop of\r\nCanterbury: of great power in earthly matters, in high favour with God;\r\nin the one representing Martha, in the other Mary. Next to king Alfred,\r\nhe was the most extraordinary patron of the liberal arts throughout\r\nthe whole island; the munificent restorer of monasteries; terrible\r\nwere his denunciations against transgressing kings and princes;\r\nkind was his support of the middling and poorer classes. Indeed, so\r\nextremely anxious was he to preserve peace ever in trivial matters,\r\nthat, as his countrymen used to assemble in taverns, and when a little\r\nelevated quarrel as to the proportions of their liquor, he ordered\r\ngold or silver pegs to be fastened in the pots, that whilst every man\r\nknew his just measure, shame should compel each neither to take more\r\nhimself, nor oblige others to drink beyond their proportional share.\r\nOsberne,[183] precentor of Canterbury, second to none of these times\r\nin composition, and indisputably the best skilled of all in music,\r\nwho wrote his life with Roman elegance, forbids me to relate farther\r\npraiseworthy anecdotes of him. Besides, in addition to this, if the\r\ndivine grace shall accompany my design, I intend after the succession\r\nof the kings at least to particularize the names of all the bishops\r\nof each province in England, and to offer them to the knowledge of\r\nmy countrymen, if I shall be able to coin anything worth notice out\r\nof the mintage of antiquity. How powerful indeed the sanctity and\r\nvirtue of Dunstan’s disciples were, is sufficiently evidenced by\r\nEthelwold, made abbat of Abingdon from a monk of Glastonbury, and\r\nafterwards bishop of Winchester, who built so many and such great\r\nmonasteries, as to make it appear hardly credible how the bishop of one\r\nsee should be able to effect what the king of England himself could\r\nscarcely undertake. I am deceived, and err through hasty opinion, if\r\nwhat I assert be not evident. How great are the monasteries of Ely,\r\nPeterborough, and Thorney, which he raised from the foundations, and\r\ncompleted by his industry; which though repeatedly reduced by the\r\nwickedness of plunderers, are yet sufficient for their inhabitants.\r\nHis life was composed in a decent style by Wulstan,[184] precentor of\r\nWinchester, who had been his attendant and pupil: he wrote also another\r\nvery useful work, “On the Harmony of Sounds,” a proof that he was a\r\nlearned Englishman, a man of pious life and correct eloquence. At that\r\ntime too Oswald, nephew of Odo, who had been archbishop before Dunstan,\r\nfrom a monk of Flory becoming bishop of Worcester and archbishop of\r\nYork, claimed equal honours with the others. Treading the same paths,\r\nhe extended the monastic profession by his authority, and built a\r\nmonastery at Ramsey in a marshy situation. He filled the cathedral\r\nof Worcester with monks, the canons not being driven out by force,\r\nbut circumvented by pious fraud.[185] Bishop Ethelwold, by the royal\r\ncommand, had before expelled the canons from Winchester, who, upon\r\nthe king’s giving them an option either to live according to rule, or\r\ndepart the place, gave the preference to an easy life, and were at that\r\ntime without fixed habitations wandering over the whole island. In this\r\nmanner these three persons, illuminating England, as it were, with a\r\ntriple light, chased away the thick darkness of error. In consequence,\r\nEdgar advanced the monastery of Glastonbury, which he ever loved beyond\r\nall others, with great possessions, and was anxiously vigilant in all\r\nthings pertaining either to the beauty or convenience of the church,\r\nwhether internally or externally. It may be proper here to subjoin to\r\nour narrative the charter he granted to the said church, as I have read\r\nit in their ancient chartulary.[186]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 973.] EDGAR’S CHARTER.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 973.] CHARTER OF GLASTONBURY.]\r\n\r\n“Edgar of glorious memory, king of the Angles, son of king Edmund,\r\nwhose inclinations were ever vigilantly bent on divine matters, often\r\ncoming to the monastery of the holy mother of God at Glastonbury, and\r\nstudying to honour this place with dignity superior to others, hath by\r\nthe common consent of the bishops, abbats, and nobility, conferred on\r\nit many and very splendid privileges;--the first of which is, that no\r\nperson, unless a monk of that place, shall there be abbat, either in\r\nname or in office, nor any other, except such as the common consent of\r\nthe meeting shall have chosen according to the tenor of the rule. But\r\nshould necessity so ordain, that an abbat or monk of another monastery\r\nbe made president of this place, then he deems it proper that none\r\nshall be appointed, but such as the congregation of the monastery may\r\nelect, to preside over them in the fear of the Lord; nor shall this be\r\ndone, if any, even the lowest of the congregation, can be there found\r\nfit for the office. He hath appointed too, that the election of their\r\nabbat shall rest for ever in the monks, reserving only to himself\r\nand his heirs the power of giving the pastoral staff to the elected\r\nbrother. He hath ordained also, that so often as the abbat or the monks\r\nof this place shall appoint any of their society to be dignified with\r\nholy orders, they shall cause any bishop canonically ordained, either\r\nin his own cathedral, or in the monastery of St. Mary at Glastonbury,\r\nto ordain such monks and clerks as they deem fit to the church of St.\r\nMary. He hath granted moreover, that as he himself decides in his own\r\ndominions, so the abbat or the convent shall decide the causes of\r\ntheir entire island,[187] in all matters ecclesiastical or secular,\r\nwithout the contradiction of any one. Nor shall it be lawful for any\r\nperson to enter that island which bore witness to his birth, whether\r\nhe be bishop, duke, or prince, or person of whatever order, for the\r\npurpose of there doing any thing prejudicial to the servants of God:\r\nthis he forbids altogether, in the same manner as his predecessors have\r\nsanctioned and confirmed by their privileges; that is to say, Kentwin,\r\nIna, Ethelard, Cuthred, Alfred, Edward, Athelstan, and Edmund. When,\r\ntherefore, by the common consent, as has been said, of his prelates,\r\nabbats, and nobility, he determined to grant these privileges to the\r\nplace aforesaid, he laid his own horn, beautifully formed of ivory\r\nand adorned with gold, upon the altar of the holy mother of God, and\r\nby that donation confirmed them to the same holy mother of God, and\r\nher monks, to be possessed for ever. Soon after he caused this horn\r\nto be cut in two in his presence, that no future abbat might give or\r\nsell it to any one, commanding part of it to be kept upon the spot\r\nfor a testimony of the aforesaid donation. Recollecting, however, how\r\ngreat is the temerity of human inconstancy, and on whom it is likely\r\nto creep, and fearing lest any one hereafter should attempt to take\r\naway these privileges from this place, or eject the monks, he sent\r\nthis charter of royal liberality to the renowned lord, pope John, who\r\nhad succeeded Octavian in the honour of the pontificate, begging him\r\nto corroborate these grants by an apostolical bull. Kindly receiving\r\nthe legation, the pope, with the assenting voice of the Roman council,\r\nconfirmed what had been already ordained, by writing an apostolical\r\ninjunction, terribly hurling on the violators of them, should any\r\nbe so daring, the vengeance of a perpetual curse. This confirmation\r\ntherefore of the aforesaid pope, directed to the same place, king\r\nEdgar, of worthy memory, laid upon the altar of the holy mother of God\r\nfor a perpetual remembrance, commanding it to be carefully kept in\r\nfuture for the information of posterity. We have judged it proper to\r\ninsert both these instruments, lest we should be supposed to invent\r\nsuch things against those persons who seek to enter into the fold\r\nof St. Mary, not like shepherds, by the door, but like thieves and\r\nrobbers, some other way. “Be it known to all the faithful, that I,\r\nJohn the twelfth, through the mercy of God unworthy pope of the holy\r\nRoman See, am intreated by the humble request of the noble Edgar,\r\nking of the Angles, and of Dunstan, archbishop of the holy church of\r\nCanterbury, for the monastery of St. Mary, Glastonbury; which, induced\r\nby the love of the heavenly King, they have endowed with many great\r\npossessions, increasing in it the monastic order, and having confirmed\r\nit by royal grant, they pray me also so to do. Wherefore assenting to\r\ntheir affectionate request, I take that place into the bosom of the\r\nRoman church, and the protection of the holy apostles, and support\r\nand confirm its immunities as long as it shall remain in the same\r\nconventual order in which it now flourishes. The monks shall have\r\npower to elect their own superior; ordination, as well of monks as\r\nof clerks, shall be at the will of the abbat and convent. We ordain,\r\nmoreover, that no person shall have liberty to enter this island,\r\neither to hold courts, to make inquiry, or to correct; and should any\r\none attempt to oppose this, or to take away, retain, diminish, or\r\nharass with vexatious boldness, the possessions of the same church,\r\nhe shall become liable to a perpetual curse, by the authority of God\r\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the holy mother of God, the holy\r\napostles Peter and Paul, and all saints, unless he recant. But the\r\npeace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all who maintain the rights of\r\nthe place aforesaid. Amen. And let this our deed remain unshaken. Done\r\nin the time of Edward, abbat of the said monastery.” The aforesaid\r\nking Edgar confirmed these things at London, by his solemn charter, in\r\nthe twelfth year of his reign; and in the same year, that is, of our\r\nLord 965,[188] the pope aforesaid allowed them in a general synod at\r\nRome, and commanded all members of superior dignity who were present at\r\nthe said general council, to confirm them likewise. Let the despisers\r\nthen of so terrible a curse consider well what an extensive sentence\r\nof excommunication hangs over their heads: and indeed to St. Peter\r\nthe apostle, the chief of apostles, Christ gave the office either of\r\nbinding or loosing, as well as the keys of the kingdom of heaven. But\r\nto all the faithful it must be plain and evident, that the head of\r\nthe Roman church must be the vicar of this apostle, and the immediate\r\ninheritor of his power. Over this church then John of holy memory\r\nlaudably presided in his lifetime, as he lives to this day in glorious\r\nrecollection, promoted thereto by the choice of God and of all the\r\npeople. If then the ordinance of St. Peter the apostle be binding,\r\nconsequently that of John the pope must be so likewise; but not even\r\na madman would deny the ordinance of Peter the apostle to be binding,\r\nconsequently no one in his sober senses can say that the ordinance of\r\nJohn the pope is invalid. Either, therefore, acknowledging the power\r\nconferred by Christ on St. Peter and his successors, they will abstain\r\nfrom transgressing against the authority of so dreadful an interdict,\r\nor else contemning it, they will, with the devil and his angels, bring\r\nupon themselves the eternal duration of the curse aforewritten. In\r\nconsequence, it is manifest that no stranger ever seized this monastery\r\nfor himself, who did not, as shall appear, disgracefully lose it again;\r\nand that this occurred, not by any concerted plan of the monks, but by\r\nthe judgment of God, for the avenging his holy authority. Wherefore let\r\nno man reading this despise it, nor make himself conspicuous by being\r\nangry at it; for should he, perhaps he will confess that to be said of\r\nhimself which was designed to be spoken of another. The monastic order,\r\nfor a long time depressed, now joyfully reared its head, and hence it\r\ncame to pass that our monastery also resumed its ancient liberties: but\r\nthis I think will be more suitably related in the words of the king\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 973.] ELFRIC GUARDIAN OF MALMESBURY.]\r\n\r\n“I, Edgar, king of all Albion, and exalted, by the subjection of the\r\nsurrounding kings maritime or insular, by the bountiful grace of God,\r\nto a degree never enjoyed by any of my progenitors, have often, mindful\r\nof so high an honour, diligently considered what offering I should\r\nmore especially make from my earthly kingdom, to the King of kings.\r\nIn aid of my pious devotion, heavenly love suddenly insinuated to my\r\nwatchful solicitude, that I should rebuild all the holy monasteries\r\nthroughout my kingdom, which, as they were outwardly ruinous, with\r\nmouldering shingles and worm-eaten boards, even to the rafters, so,\r\nwhat was still worse, they had become internally neglected, and almost\r\ndestitute of the service of God; wherefore, ejecting those illiterate\r\nclerks, subject to the discipline of no regular order, in many places\r\nI have appointed pastors of an holier race, that is, of the monastic\r\norder, supplying them with ample means out of my royal revenues to\r\nrepair their churches wherever ruinated. One of these pastors, by\r\nname Elfric, in all things a true priest, I have appointed guardian\r\nof that most celebrated monastery which the Angles call by a twofold\r\nname Maldelmes-burgh. To which, for the benefit of my soul, and in\r\nhonour of our Saviour, and the holy mother of God the virgin Mary,\r\nand the apostles Peter and Paul, and the amiable prelate Aldhelm, I\r\nhave restored, with munificent liberality, a portion of land: and\r\nmore especially a piece of ground,[189] with meadows and woods.\r\nThis, leased out by the aforesaid priest, was unjustly held by the\r\ncontentious Edelnot; but his vain and subtle disputation being heard by\r\nmy counsellors, and his false defence being, in my presence, nullified,\r\nby them, I have restored it to the use of the monastery in the year of\r\nour Lord 974, in the fourteenth of my reign, and the first of my royal\r\nconsecration.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 973.] EDGAR’S VISION.]\r\n\r\nAnd here I deem it not irrelevant to commit to writing what was\r\nsupernaturally shown to the king. He had entered a wood abundant in\r\ngame, and, as usually happens, while his associates were dispersed in\r\nthe thicket for the purpose of hunting, he was left alone. Pursuing\r\nhis course, he came to the outlet of the wood, and stopping there\r\nwaited for his companions. Shortly after, seized with an irresistible\r\ndesire to sleep, he alighted from his horse, that the enjoyment of a\r\nshort repose might assuage the fatigue of the past day. He lay down,\r\ntherefore, under a wild apple-tree, where the clustering branches had\r\nformed a shady canopy all around. A river, flowing softly beside him,\r\nadding to his drowsiness, by its gentle murmur soothed him to sleep;\r\nwhen a bitch, of the hunting breed, pregnant, and lying down at his\r\nfeet, terrified him in his slumbers. Though the mother was silent, yet\r\nthe whelps within her womb barked in various sonorous tones, incited,\r\nas it were, by a singular delight in the place of their confinement.\r\nAstonished at this prodigy, as he lifted up his eyes towards the summit\r\nof the tree, he saw, first one apple, and then another, fall into the\r\nriver, by the collision of which, the watery bubbles being put in\r\ncommotion, a voice articulately sounded, “Well is thee.” Soon after,\r\ndriven by the rippling wave, a little pitcher appeared upon the stream,\r\nand after that a larger vessel, overflowing with water, for the former\r\nwas empty: and although by the violence of the stream the greater\r\nvessel pressed upon the lesser that it might discharge its waters\r\ninto it; yet it ever happened that the pitcher escaped, still empty,\r\nand again, as in a haughty and insulting manner, attacked the larger.\r\nReturning home, as the Psalmist says, “He thought upon what had been\r\ndone, and sought out his spirit.” His mother addressed him, however,\r\nthat she might cheer both his countenance and his heart; saying, it\r\nshould be her care to entreat God, who knew how to explain mysteries\r\nby the light of his inspiration. With this admonition he dispelled his\r\ngrief and dismissed his anxiety, conscious of his mother’s sanctity, to\r\nwhom God had vouchsafed many revelations. Her name was Elfgiva, a woman\r\nintent on good works, and gifted with such affection and kindness, that\r\nshe would even secretly discharge the penalties of those culprits whom\r\nthe sad sentence of the judges had publicly condemned. That costly\r\nclothing, which, to many women, is the pander of vice, was to her the\r\nmeans of liberality; as she would give a garment of the most beautiful\r\nworkmanship to the first poor person she saw. Even malice itself, as\r\nthere was nothing to carp at, might praise the beauty of her person and\r\nthe work of her hands. Thoroughly comprehending the presage, she said\r\nto her son next morning, “The barking of the whelps while the mother\r\nwas sleeping, implies, that after your death, those persons who are\r\nnow living and in power, dying also, miscreants yet unborn will bark\r\nagainst the church of God. And whereas one apple followed the other,\r\nso that the voice, ‘Well is thee,’ seemed to proceed from the dashing\r\nof the second against the first, this implies that from you, who are\r\nnow a tree shading all England, two sons will proceed; the favourers\r\nof the second will destroy the first, when the chiefs of the different\r\nparties will say to each of the boys, ‘Well is thee,’ because the dead\r\nwill reign in heaven, the living on earth, Forasmuch as the greater\r\npitcher could not fill the smaller, this signifies, that the Northern\r\nnations, which are more numerous than the English, shall attack England\r\nafter your death; and, although they may recruit their deficiencies by\r\nperpetual supplies of their countrymen, yet they shall never be able\r\nto fill this Angle of the world, but instead of that, our Angles, when\r\nthey seem to be completely subjugated, shall drive them out, and it\r\nshall remain under its own and God’s governance, even unto the time\r\nbefore appointed by Christ. Amen.”\r\n\r\nFarther perusal will justify the truth of the presage. The manifest\r\nsanctity both of parent and child ought here to be considered; that the\r\none should see a mystery when broad awake without impediment, and that\r\nthe other should be able to solve the problem by the far-discerning eye\r\nof prophecy. The rigour of Edgar’s justice was equal to the sanctity\r\nof his manners, so that he permitted no person, be his dignity what\r\nit might, to elude the laws with impunity. In his time there was no\r\nprivate thief, no public freebooter, unless such as chose to risk the\r\nloss of life for their attacks upon the property of others.[190] How,\r\nindeed, can it be supposed that he would pass over the crimes of men\r\nwhen he designed to exterminate every beast of prey from his kingdom;\r\nand commanded Judwall, king of the Welsh, to pay him yearly a tribute\r\nof three hundred wolves? This he performed for three years, but omitted\r\nin the fourth, declaring that he could find no more.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 973.] EDGAR’S CHARACTER.]\r\n\r\nAlthough it is reported that he was extremely small both in stature\r\nand in bulk, yet nature had condescended to enclose such strength in\r\nthat diminutive body, that he would voluntarily challenge any person,\r\nwhom he knew to be bold and valiant, to engage with him, and his\r\ngreatest apprehension was, lest they should stand in awe of him in\r\nthese encounters. Moreover, at a certain banquet, where the prating\r\nof coxcombs generally shows itself very freely, it is reported that\r\nKinad, king of the Scots, said in a sportive manner, that it seemed\r\nextraordinary to him how so many provinces should be subject to such a\r\nsorry little fellow. This was caught up with malignant ear by a certain\r\nminstrel, and afterwards cast in Edgar’s teeth, with the customary\r\nraillery of such people. But he, concealing the circumstance from his\r\nfriends, sent for Kinad, as if to consult him on some secret matter\r\nof importance, and leading him aside far into the recesses of a wood,\r\nhe gave him one of two swords, which he had brought with him. “Now,”\r\nsaid he, “as we are alone, I shall have an opportunity of proving your\r\nstrength; I will now make it appear which ought deservedly to command\r\nthe other; nor shall you stir a foot till you try the matter with me,\r\nfor it is disgraceful in a king to prate at a banquet, and not to be\r\nprompt in action.” Confused, and not daring to utter a word, he fell at\r\nthe feet of his sovereign lord, and asked pardon for what was merely\r\na joke; which he immediately obtained. But what of this? Every summer,\r\nas soon as the festival of Easter was passed, he ordered his ships to\r\nbe collected on each coast; cruising to the western part of the island\r\nwith the eastern fleet; and, dismissing that, with the western to the\r\nnorth; and then again with the northern squadron towards the east,\r\ncarefully vigilant lest pirates should disturb the country. During the\r\nwinter and spring, travelling through the provinces, he made inquiry\r\ninto the decisions of men in power, severely avenging violated laws,\r\nby the one mode advancing justice, by the other military strength; and\r\nin both consulting public utility. There are some persons, indeed,\r\nwho endeavour to dim his exceeding glory by saying, that in his\r\nearlier years he was cruel to his subjects, and libidinous in respect\r\nof virgins. Their first accusation they exemplify thus. There was,\r\nin his time, one Athelwold, a nobleman of celebrity and one of his\r\nconfidants. The king had commissioned him to visit Elfthrida, daughter\r\nof Ordgar, duke of Devonshire, (whose charms had so fascinated the eyes\r\nof some persons that they commended her to the king), and to offer\r\nher marriage, if her beauty were really equal to report. Hastening on\r\nhis embassy, and finding everything consonant to general estimation,\r\nhe concealed his mission from her parents and procured the damsel for\r\nhimself. Returning to the king, he told a tale which made for his\r\nown purpose; that she was a girl nothing out of the common track of\r\nbeauty, and by no means worthy such transcendent dignity. When Edgar’s\r\nheart was disengaged from this affair, and employed on other amours,\r\nsome tattlers acquainted him, how completely Athelwold had duped him\r\nby his artifices. Paying him in his own coin, that is, returning him\r\ndeceit for deceit, he showed the earl a fair countenance, and, as in\r\na sportive manner, appointed a day when he would visit his far-famed\r\nlady. Terrified, almost to death, with this dreadful pleasantry, he\r\nhastened before to his wife, entreating that she would administer to\r\nhis safety by attiring herself as unbecomingly as possible: then first\r\ndisclosing the intention of such a proceeding. But what did not this\r\nwoman dare? She was hardy enough to deceive the confidence of her\r\nfirst lover, her first husband; to call up every charm by art, and to\r\nomit nothing which could stimulate the desire of a young and powerful\r\nman. Nor did events happen contrary to her design. For he fell so\r\ndesperately in love with her the moment he saw her, that, dissembling\r\nhis indignation, he sent for the earl into a wood at Warewelle,[191]\r\ncalled Harewood, under pretence of hunting, and ran him through with\r\na javelin: and when the illegitimate son of the murdered nobleman\r\napproached with his accustomed familiarity, and was asked by the\r\nking how he liked that kind of sport, he is reported to have said,\r\n“Well, my sovereign liege, I ought not to be displeased with that\r\nwhich gives you pleasure.” This answer so assuaged the mind of the\r\nraging monarch, that, for the remainder of his life, he held no one in\r\ngreater estimation than this young man; mitigating the offence of his\r\ntyrannical deed against the father, by royal solicitude for the son.\r\nIn expiation of this crime, a monastery which was built on the spot by\r\nElfthrida is inhabited by a large congregation of nuns.\r\n\r\nTo this instance of cruelty, they add a second of lust. Hearing of the\r\nbeauty of a certain virgin, who was dedicated to God, he carried her\r\noff from a monastery by force, ravished her, and repeatedly made her\r\nthe partner of his bed. When this circumstance reached the ears of\r\nSt. Dunstan, he was vehemently reproved by him, and underwent a seven\r\nyears’ penance; though a king, submitting to fast and to forego the\r\nwearing of his crown for that period.[192] They add a third, in which\r\nboth vices may be discovered. King Edgar coming to Andover, a town not\r\nfar from Winchester, ordered the daughter of a certain nobleman, the\r\nfame of whose beauty had been loudly extolled, to be brought to him.\r\nThe mother of the young lady, shocked at the proposed concubinage of\r\nher daughter, assisted by the darkness of night placed an attendant\r\nin his bed; a maiden indeed neither deficient in elegance nor in\r\nunderstanding. The night having passed, when aurora was hastening\r\ninto day, the woman attempted to rise; and being asked, “why in such\r\nhaste?” she replied, “to perform the daily labour of her mistress.”\r\nRetained though with difficulty, on her knees she bewailed her wretched\r\nsituation to the king, and entreated her freedom as the recompence\r\nof her connexion with him; saying, “that it became his greatness, not\r\nto suffer one who had ministered to his royal pleasure, any longer\r\nto groan under the commands of cruel masters.” His indignation being\r\nexcited, and sternly smiling, while his mind was wavering between\r\npity to the girl, and displeasure to her mistress, he, at last, as\r\nif treating the whole as a joke, released her from servitude, and\r\ndismissed his anger. Soon after, he exalted her with great honour, to\r\nbe mistress of her former tyrants, little consulting how they liked\r\nit, loved her entirely, nor left her bed till he took Elfthrida, the\r\ndaughter of Ordgar, to be his legitimate wife. Elfthrida bore him\r\nEdmund, who dying five years before his father, lies buried at Romsey,\r\nand Ethelred, who reigned after him. Besides, of Egelfleda, surnamed\r\nthe fair, the daughter of the most powerful duke, Ordmer, he begot\r\nEdward; and St. Editha of Wulfritha, who it is certain was not a nun\r\nat that time, but being a lay virgin had assumed the veil through fear\r\nof the king, though she was immediately afterwards forced to the royal\r\nbed; on which, St. Dunstan, offended that he should desire lustfully a\r\nperson who had been even the semblance of a nun, exerted the pontifical\r\npower against him. But however these things may be, this is certain,\r\nthat from the sixteenth year of his age, when he was appointed king,\r\ntill the thirtieth, he reigned without the insignia of royalty; for at\r\nthat time, the princes and men of every order assembling generally, he\r\nwas crowned with great pomp at Bath, survived only three years, and\r\nwas buried at Glastonbury. Nor is it to be forgotten, that when abbat\r\nAilward opened his tomb in the year of our Lord 1052, he found the body\r\nunconscious of corruption; which instead of inclining him to reverence,\r\nserved only to increase his audacity. For when the receptacle which\r\nhe had prepared, seemed too small to admit the body, he profaned the\r\nroyal corpse by cutting it. Whence the blood immediately gushing out\r\nin torrents, shook the hearts of the by-standers with horror. In\r\nconsequence his royal remains were placed upon the altar in a shrine,\r\nwhich he had himself given to this church, with the head of St.\r\nApollinaris, and the relics of Vincent the martyr; which purchased,\r\nat a great price, he had added to the beauty of the house of God. The\r\nviolator of the sacred body presently became distracted, and not long\r\nafter, going out of the church, met his death by a broken neck. Nor did\r\nthe display of royal sanctity stop thus; it proceeded still further,\r\na man, lunatic and blind, being there cured. Deservedly then does the\r\nreport prevail among the English, that no king, either of his own or\r\nformer times in England, could be justly and fairly compared to Edgar:\r\nfor nothing could be more holy than his life, nothing more praiseworthy\r\nthan his justice; those vices excepted which he afterwards obliterated\r\nby abundant virtues: a man who rendered his country illustrious through\r\nhis distinguished courage, and the brilliancy of his actions, as well\r\nas by the increase of the servants of God. After his departure, the\r\nstate and the hopes of the English met with a melancholy reverse.[193]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\n_Of St. Edward king and martyr the son of Edgar._ [A.D. 975-978.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 975-977.] COUNCIL AT CALNE.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 975, Edward the son of Edgar began to reign,\r\nand enjoyed the sovereignty for three years and a half. Dunstan, in\r\ncommon consent with the other bishops, elevated him to the royal\r\ndignity, in opposition, as it is said, to the will of some of the\r\nnobility, and of his step-mother; who was anxious to advance her son\r\nEthelred, a child scarcely seven years of age, in order that herself\r\nmight govern under colour of his name. Then, from the increasing\r\nmalice of men, the happiness of the kingdom was impaired; then too,\r\ncomets were seen, which were asserted certainly to portend either\r\npestilence to the inhabitants, or a change in the government. Nor\r\nwas it long ere there followed a scarcity of corn; famine among men;\r\nmurrain among cattle; and an extraordinary accident at a royal town\r\ncalled Calne. For as soon as Edgar was dead, the secular canons who\r\nhad been for some time expelled their monasteries, rekindled the\r\nformer feuds, alleging, that it was a great and serious disgrace, for\r\nnew comers to drive the ancient inmates from their dwellings; that\r\nit could not be esteemed grateful to God, who had granted them their\r\nancient habitations: neither could it be so to any considerate man,\r\nwho might dread that injustice as likely to befall himself, which he\r\nhad seen overtake others. Hence they proceeded to clamour and rage,\r\nand hastened to Dunstan; the principal people, as is the custom of the\r\nlaity, exclaiming more especially, that the injury which the canons\r\nhad wrongfully suffered, ought to be redressed by gentler measures.\r\nMoreover, one of them, Elferius, with more than common audacity, had\r\neven overturned almost all the monasteries which that highly revered\r\nmonk Ethelwold, bishop of Winchester, had built throughout Mercia.\r\nOn this account a full synod being convened, they first assembled at\r\nWinchester. What was the issue of the contest of that place, other\r\nwritings declare;[194] relating, that the image of our Saviour,\r\nspeaking decidedly, confounded the canons and their party. But men’s\r\nminds being not yet at rest on the subject, a council was called at\r\nCalne; where, when all the senators of England, the king being absent\r\non account of his youth, had assembled in an upper chamber, and the\r\nbusiness was agitated with much animosity and debate; while the weapons\r\nof harsh reproach were directed against that firmest bulwark of the\r\nchurch, I mean Dunstan, but could not shake it; and men of every rank\r\nwere earnestly defending their several sides of the question; the floor\r\nwith its beams and supporters gave way suddenly and fell to the ground.\r\nAll fell with it except Dunstan, who alone escaped unhurt by standing\r\non a single rafter which retained its position: the rest were either\r\nkilled, or subjected to lasting infirmity. This miracle procured the\r\narchbishop peace on the score of the canons; all the English, both at\r\nthat time and afterwards, yielding to his sentiments.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile king Edward conducted himself with becoming affection to\r\nhis infant brother and his step-mother; he retained only the name\r\nof king, and gave them the power; following the footsteps of his\r\nfather’s piety, and giving both his attention and his heart to good\r\ncouncil. The woman, however, with that hatred which a step-mother\r\nonly can entertain, began to meditate a subtle stratagem, in order\r\nthat not even the title of king might be wanting to her child, and to\r\nlay a treacherous snare for her son-in-law, which she accomplished\r\nin the following manner. He was returning home, tired with the chase\r\nand gasping with thirst from the exercise, while his companions were\r\nfollowing the dogs in different directions as it happened, when hearing\r\nthat they dwelt in a neighbouring mansion, the youth proceeded thither\r\nat full speed, unattended and unsuspecting, as he judged of others\r\nby his own feelings. On his arrival, alluring him to her with female\r\nblandishment, she made him lean forward, and after saluting him while\r\nhe was eagerly drinking from the cup which had been presented, the\r\ndagger of an attendant pierced him through. Dreadfully wounded, with\r\nall his remaining strength he clapped spurs to his horse in order to\r\njoin his companions; when one foot slipping, he was dragged by the\r\nother through the trackless paths and recesses of the wood, while the\r\nstreaming blood gave evidence of his death to his followers. Moreover,\r\nthey then commanded him to be ingloriously interred at Wareham; envying\r\nhim even holy ground when dead, as they had envied him his royal\r\ndignity while living. They now publicly manifested their extreme joy\r\nas if they had buried his memory with his body; but God’s all-seeing\r\neye was there, who ennobled the innocent victim by the glory of\r\nmiracles. So much is human outweighed by heavenly judgment. For there\r\nlights were shown from above; there the lame walked; there the dumb\r\nresumed his faculty of speech; there every malady gave way to health.\r\nThe fame of this pervading all England, proclaimed the merits of the\r\nmartyr. The murderess excited by it, attempted a progress thither;\r\nand was already urging forward the horse she had mounted, when she\r\nperceived the manifest anger of God; for the same creature which she\r\nhad heretofore constantly ridden, and which was used to outstrip the\r\nvery wind in speed, now by command of God, stood motionless. The\r\nattendants, both with whips and clamours, urged him forward that he\r\nmight carry his noble mistress with his usual readiness; but their\r\nlabour was in vain. They changed the horse; and the same circumstance\r\nrecurred. Her obdurate heart, though late, perceived the meaning of\r\nthe miracle; wherefore, what she was not herself permitted to do, she\r\nsuffered to be performed by another: for that Elferius, whom I before\r\nblamed for destroying the monasteries, repenting of his rashness, and\r\nbeing deeply distressed in mind, took up the sacred corpse from its\r\nunworthy burial-place, and paid it just and distinguished honours at\r\nShaftesbury. He did not escape unpunished, however, for, within a year\r\nafterwards, he was eaten of the vermin which we call lice. Moreover,\r\nsince a mind unregulated is a torment to itself, and a restless spirit\r\nendures its own peculiar punishment in this life, Elfthrida declining\r\nfrom her regal pride, became extremely penitent; so that at Werewell,\r\nfor many years, she clothed her pampered body in hair-cloth, slept at\r\nnight upon the ground without a pillow; and mortified her flesh with\r\nevery kind of penance. She was a beautiful woman; singularly faithful\r\nto her husband; but deserving punishment from the commission of so\r\ngreat a crime. It is believed and commonly reported, that from her\r\nviolence to Edward, the country for a long time after groaned under the\r\nyoke of barbarian servitude.\r\n\r\nAt Shaftesbury, truly shines a splendid proof of royal sanctity; for\r\nto his merit must it be attributed, that there a numerous choir of\r\nwomen dedicated to God, not only enlighten those parts with the blaze\r\nof their religion, but even reach the very heavens. There reside\r\nsacred virgins wholly unconscious of contamination, there, continent\r\nwidows, ignorant of a second flame after the extinction of the first;\r\nin all whose manner, graceful modesty is so blended with chastened\r\nelegance, that nothing can exceed it. Indeed it is matter of doubt\r\nwhich to applaud most, their assiduity in the service of God or their\r\naffability in their converse with men: hence assent is justly given to\r\nthose persons who say that, the world, which has long tottered with the\r\nweight of its sins, is entirely supported by their prayers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\n_Of king Ethelred and king Edmund._ [A.D. 979-1017.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 978, 979.] ETHELRED--EDMUND.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord’s incarnation 979, Ethelred, son of Edgar and\r\nElfthrida, obtaining the kingdom, occupied, rather than governed it for\r\nthirty-seven years. The career of his life is said to have been cruel\r\nin the beginning, wretched in the middle, and disgraceful in the end.\r\nThus, in the murder to which he gave his concurrence, he was cruel;\r\nbase in his flight, and effeminacy; miserable in his death. Dunstan,\r\nindeed, had foretold his worthlessness, having discovered it by a very\r\nfilthy token: for when quite an infant, the bishops standing round,\r\nas he was immersed in the baptismal font, he defiled the sacrament\r\nby a natural evacuation: at which Dunstan, being extremely angered,\r\nexclaimed, “By God, and his mother, this will be a sorry fellow.” I\r\nhave read, that when he was ten years of age, hearing it noised abroad\r\nthat his brother was killed, he so irritated his furious mother by his\r\nweeping, that not having a whip at hand, she beat the little innocent\r\nwith some candles she had snatched up: nor did she desist, till herself\r\nbedewed him, nearly lifeless, with her tears. On this account he\r\ndreaded candles during the rest of his life, to such a degree that he\r\nwould never suffer the light of them to be brought into his presence.\r\nThe nobility being assembled by the contrivance of his mother, and\r\nthe day appointed for Dunstan, in right of his see, to crown him, he,\r\nthough he might be ill-affected to them, forbore to resist, being a\r\nprelate of mature age, and long versed in secular matters. But, when\r\nplacing the crown on his head he could not refrain from giving vent\r\nwith a loud voice, to that prophetic spirit which he had so deeply\r\nimbibed. “Since,” said he, “thou hast aspired to the kingdom by the\r\ndeath of thy brother, hear the word of God; thus saith the Lord God:\r\nthe sin of thy abandoned mother, and of the accomplices of her base\r\ndesign, shall not be washed out but by much blood of the wretched\r\ninhabitants; and such evils shall come upon the English nation as they\r\nhave never suffered from the time they came to England until then.” Nor\r\nwas it long after, that is, in his third year, that seven piratical\r\nvessels came to Southampton, a port near Winchester, and having ravaged\r\nthe coast fled back to the sea: this I think right to mention because\r\nmany reports are circulated among the English, concerning these vessels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 988-994.] DUNSTAN’S PROPHECY.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1012.] TREACHERY OF EDRIC.]\r\n\r\nA quarrel between the king and the bishop of Rochester had arisen\r\nfrom some unknown cause; in consequence of which he led an army\r\nagainst that city. It was signified to him by the archbishop, that\r\nhe should desist from his fury, and not irritate St. Andrew, under\r\nwhose guardianship that bishopric was; for as he was ever ready to\r\npardon, so was he equally formidable to avenge. This simple message\r\nbeing held in contempt, he graced the intimation with money, and sent\r\nhim a hundred pounds, as a bribe, that he should raise the siege and\r\nretire. He therefore took the money, retreated, and dismissed his\r\narmy. Dunstan, astonished at his avarice, sent messengers to him\r\nwith the following words, “Since you have preferred silver to God,\r\nmoney to the apostle, and covetousness to me; the evils which God has\r\npronounced will shortly come upon you; but they will not come while\r\nI live, for this also hath God spoken.” Soon after the death of this\r\nholy man, which was in the tenth year of his reign, the predictions\r\nspeedily began to be fulfilled, and the prophecies to have their\r\nconsummation. For the Danes infested every port, and made descents on\r\nall sides with great activity, so that it was not known where they\r\ncould be opposed. But Siric, the second archbishop after Dunstan,\r\nadvised that money should repel those whom the sword could not: thus\r\na payment of ten thousand pounds satisfied the avarice of the Danes.\r\nThis was an infamous precedent, and totally unworthy the character\r\nof men, to redeem liberty, which no violence can ever extirpate from\r\na noble mind, by money. They now indeed abstained a short time from\r\ntheir incursions; but as soon as their strength was recruited by rest,\r\nthey returned to their old practices. Such extreme fear had seized\r\nthe English, that there was no thought of resistance: if any indeed,\r\nmindful of their ancient glory, made an attempt to oppose, or engage\r\nthem, they were unsuccessful, from the multitude of their enemies, and\r\nthe desertion of their allies. The leader of revolt was one Elfric,\r\nwhom the king had appointed to command the fleet: he, instead of\r\ntrying his fortune, as he ought, in a naval conflict, went over, on\r\nthe night preceding the battle, a base deserter to the enemy, whom he\r\nhad apprised, by messengers, what preparations to make; and though\r\nthe king, for this perfidious crime, ordered his son’s eyes to be\r\nput out, yet he returned again, and again deserted. All Northumbria\r\nbeing laid waste, the enemy was met in battle and worsted. London was\r\nbesieged, but honourably defended by its citizens. In consequence,\r\nthe besiegers, after suffering severely and despairing of taking the\r\ncity, retired; and devastating the whole province to the eastward,\r\ncompelled the king to pay a sum of money, amounting to sixteen\r\nthousand pounds. Moreover, hostages being given, he caused their king\r\nAnlaf to come to him, stood for him at the font, and soothing him with\r\nroyal munificence, bound him by an oath that he should never return\r\ninto England again. The evil however was not thus put to rest. For\r\nthey could never provide against their enemies from Denmark, springing\r\nup afresh, like the heads of the hydra. The province in the west of\r\nEngland, called Devonshire, was laid waste; the monasteries destroyed;\r\nand the city of Exeter set on fire: Kent was given up to plunder; the\r\nmetropolitan city and seat of the patriarchs, burnt; the holy patriarch\r\nhimself, the most reverend Elphege, carried away and bound in chains:\r\nand at last, when required to plunder his tenants in order to ransom\r\nhimself, and refusing to do so, he was stoned, struck with a hatchet,\r\nand glorified heaven with his soul. After he was murdered, God exalted\r\nhim; insomuch, that when the Danes, who had been instrumental to his\r\ndeath, saw that dead wood besmeared with his blood miraculously grew\r\ngreen again in one night, they ran eagerly to kiss his remains, and\r\nto bear them on their shoulders. Thus they abated their usual pride,\r\nand suffered his sacred corpse to be carried to London. There it was\r\nhonorably buried; and when taken up, ten years afterwards, free from\r\nevery taint of corruption, it conferred honour on his cathedral at\r\nCanterbury.[195] To the present moment both its blood remains fresh,\r\nand its soundness unimpaired, and it is considered a miracle, that\r\na carcass should be divested of life, and yet not decay. That I may\r\nnot be tedious in mentioning severally all the provinces which the\r\nDanes laid waste, let it be briefly understood, that out of thirty-two\r\ncounties, which are reckoned in England, they had already overrun\r\nsixteen; the names of which I forbear to enumerate on account of\r\nthe harshness of the language. In the meantime, the king, admirably\r\ncalculated for sleeping, did nothing but postpone and hesitate, and if\r\never he recovered his senses enough to raise himself upon his elbow,\r\nhe quickly relapsed into his original wretchedness, either from the\r\noppression of indolence, or the adverseness of fortune. His brother’s\r\nghost also, demanding dire expiation, tormented him. Who can tell\r\nhow often he collected his army? how often he ordered ships to be\r\nbuilt? how frequently he called out commanders from all quarters? and\r\nyet nothing was ever effected. For the army, destitute of a leader\r\nand ignorant of military discipline, either retreated before it\r\ncame into action, or else was easily overcome. The presence of the\r\nleader is of much avail in battle; courage manifested by him avails\r\nalso; experience, and more especially, discipline avail much; and as\r\nI have said, the want of these, in an army, must be an irreparable\r\ninjury to its countrymen, as well as a pitiable object of contempt\r\nto an enemy. For soldiers are a kind of men, who, if not restrained\r\nbefore the battle, are eager to plunder; and if not animated during\r\nit, are prone to flight. When the ships, built for the defence of the\r\nsea-coast, were lying at anchor, a tempest suddenly arising dashed\r\nthem together, and rendered them useless by the destruction of their\r\ntackling: a few, fitted from the wrecks of the others, were, by the\r\nattack of one Wulnod, whom the king had banished, either sunk, or\r\nburnt, and consequently disappointed the expectations of all England.\r\nThe commanders, if ever they met to confer, immediately chose different\r\nsides, and rarely or never united in one good plan; for they gave more\r\nattention to private quarrels, than to public exigences: and, if in\r\nthe midst of pressing danger, they had resolved on any eligible secret\r\ndesign, it was immediately communicated to the Danes by traitors. For\r\nbesides Elfric, the successor of Elfere who had murdered the late king,\r\nthere was one Edric, a man infamously skilled in such transactions,\r\nwhom the king had made governor of the Mercians. This fellow was the\r\nrefuse of mankind, the reproach of the English; an abandoned glutton,\r\na cunning miscreant; who had become opulent, not by nobility, but by\r\nspecious language and impudence. This artful dissembler, capable of\r\nfeigning anything, was accustomed, by pretended fidelity, to scent out\r\nthe king’s designs, that he might treacherously divulge them. Often,\r\nwhen despatched to the enemy as the mediator of peace, he inflamed them\r\nto battle. His perfidy was sufficiently conspicuous in this king’s\r\nreign, but much more so in the next; of which I shall have occasion to\r\nspeak hereafter. Ulfkytel, earl of the East Angles, was the only person\r\nwho, at that time, resisted the invaders with any degree of spirit;\r\ninsomuch that although the enemy had nominally the victory, yet the\r\nconquerors suffered much more than the conquered:[196] nor were the\r\nbarbarians ashamed to confess this truth, while they so frequently\r\nbewailed that victory. The valour of the earl was more conspicuously\r\neminent, after the death of Ethelred, in that battle which mowed down\r\nthe whole flower of the province; where, when he was surrounded from\r\nthe rear, deeming it disgraceful to fly, he gave fresh confidence to\r\nthe king by his blood; but this happened some time after.[197] At this\r\njuncture, that the measure of king Ethelred’s misery might be full, a\r\nfamine ravaged all England, and those whom war had spared perished from\r\nwant. The enemy over-ran the country with such freedom, that they would\r\ncarry off their booty to their ships through a space of fifty miles,\r\nwithout fearing any resistance from the inhabitants. In the midst of\r\nthese pressing evils, the expedient of buying off hostilities by money\r\nwas again debated and adopted; for first twenty-four, and soon after,\r\nthirty thousand pounds were given to the Danes: with what advantage,\r\nsucceeding times will show. To me, indeed, deeply reflecting upon the\r\nsubject, it seems wonderful, how a man, as we have been taught to\r\nsuppose, neither very foolish, nor excessively heartless, should pass\r\nhis life in the wretched endurance of so many calamities. Should any\r\none ask me the reason of this, I could not easily answer, except by\r\nsaying, that the revolt of the generals proceeded from the haughtiness\r\nof the king. Their perfidy has been spoken of before: I now hasten to\r\ninstances of his violence, which was so intolerable, that he spared not\r\neven his own relations. For, besides the English, whom he despoiled\r\nof their hereditary possessions without any cause, or defrauded of\r\ntheir property for supposititious crimes: besides the Danes, whom,\r\nfrom light suspicion only, he ordered to be all butchered on the same\r\nday throughout England; which was a dreadful spectacle to behold; each\r\none compelled to betray his dearest guests, now become dearer from the\r\ntenderest connexions of affinity, and to cut short their embraces with\r\nthe sword: yet besides all this, I say, he was so inconstant towards\r\nhis wife, that he scarcely deigned her his bed, and degraded the royal\r\ndignity by his intercourse with harlots. She too, a woman, conscious of\r\nher high descent, became indignant at her husband, as she found herself\r\nendeared to him neither by her blameless modesty nor her fruitfulness;\r\nfor she had borne him two children, Elfred and Edward. She was the\r\ndaughter of Richard, earl of Normandy, the son of William, who, after\r\nhis father, presided over that earldom for fifty-two years, and died\r\nin the twenty-eighth year of this king. He lies at the monastery of\r\nFescamp, which he augmented with certain revenues, and which he adorned\r\nwith a monastic order, by means of William, formerly abbat of Dijon.\r\nRichard was a distinguished character, and had also often harassed\r\nEthelred: which, when it became known at Rome, the holy see, not\r\nenduring that two Christians should be at enmity, sent Leo, bishop of\r\nTreves, into England, to restore peace: the epistle describing this\r\nlegation was as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 991.] EPISTLE OF POPE JOHN XV.]\r\n\r\n“John the fifteenth, pope of the holy Roman church, to all faithful\r\npeople, health. Be it known to all the faithful of the holy mother\r\nchurch, and our children spiritual and secular, dispersed through the\r\nseveral climates of the world, that inasmuch as we had been informed\r\nby many of the enmity between Ethelred, king of the West-Saxons, and\r\nRichard the marquis, and were grieved sorely at this, on account of our\r\nspiritual children; taking, therefore, wholesome counsel, we summoned\r\none of our legates, Leo, bishop of the holy church of Treves, and sent\r\nhim with our letters, admonishing them, that they should return from\r\ntheir ungodliness. He, passing vast spaces, at length crossed the sea,\r\nand, on the day of the Lord’s nativity, came into the presence of the\r\nsaid king; whom, having saluted on our part, he delivered to him the\r\nletters we had sent. And all the faithful people of his kingdom, and\r\nsenators of either order, being summoned, he granted, for love and\r\nfear of God Almighty, and of St. Peter, the chief of the apostles, and\r\non account of our paternal admonition, the firmest peace for all his\r\nsons and daughters, present and future, and all his faithful people,\r\nwithout deceit. On which account he sent Edelsin, prelate of the holy\r\nchurch of Sherborne, and Leofstan, son of Alfwold, and Edelnoth, son\r\nof Wulstan, who passed the maritime boundaries, and came to Richard,\r\nthe said marquis. He, peaceably receiving our admonitions, and hearing\r\nthe determination of the said king, readily confirmed the peace for\r\nhis sons and daughters, present and future, and for all his faithful\r\npeople, with this reasonable condition, that if any of their subjects,\r\nor they themselves, should commit any injustice against each other,\r\nit should be duly redressed; and that peace should remain for ever\r\nunshaken and confirmed by the oath of both parties: on the part of king\r\nEthelred, to wit, Edelsin, prelate of the holy church of Sherborne;\r\nLeofstan, the son of Alfwold; Edelnoth, the son of Wulstan. On the part\r\nof Richard, Roger, the bishop; Rodolph, son of Hugh; Truteno, the son\r\nof Thurgis.\r\n\r\n“Done at Rouen, on the kalends of March, in the year of our Lord 991,\r\nthe fourth of the indiction. Moreover, of the king’s subjects, or of\r\nhis enemies, let Richard receive none, nor the king of his, without\r\ntheir respective seals.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1002.] ISIDORE--GERBERT.]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of this John, Gregory succeeded; after whom came John\r\nXVI.; then Silvester, also called Gerbert, about whom it will not be\r\nabsurd, in my opinion, if I commit to writing those facts which are\r\ngenerally related about him.[198] Born in Gaul, from a lad he grew\r\nup a monk at Flory; afterwards, when he arrived at the double path\r\nof Pythagoras,[199] either disgusted at a monastic life or seized by\r\nlust of glory, he fled by night into Spain, chiefly designing to learn\r\nastrology and other sciences of that description from the Saracens.\r\nSpain, formerly for many years possessed by the Romans, in the time\r\nof the emperor Honorius, fell under the power of the Goths. The Goths\r\nwere Arians down to the days of St. Gregory, when that people were\r\nunited to the Catholic church by Leander bishop of Seville, and by king\r\nRecared, brother of Hermengildus,[200] whom his father slew on Easter\r\nnight for professing the true faith. To Leander succeeded Isidore,[201]\r\ncelebrated for learning and sanctity, whose body purchased, for its\r\nweight in gold, Aldefonsus king of Gallicia in our times conveyed to\r\nToledo. The Saracens, who had subjugated the Goths, being conquered\r\nin their turn by Charles the Great, lost Gallicia and Lusitania, the\r\nlargest provinces of Spain; but to this day they possess the southern\r\nparts. As the Christians esteem Toledo, so do they hold Hispalis,\r\nwhich in common they call Seville, to be the capital of the kingdom;\r\nthere practising divinations and incantations, after the usual mode\r\nof that nation. Gerbert then, as I have related, coming among these\r\npeople, satisfied his desires. There he surpassed Ptolemy with the\r\nastrolabe,[202] and Alcandræus in astronomy, and Julius Firmicus in\r\njudicial astrology; there he learned what the singing and the flight\r\nof birds portended; there he acquired the art of calling up spirits\r\nfrom hell: in short, whatever, hurtful or salutary, human curiosity\r\nhas discovered. There is no necessity to speak of his progress in the\r\nlawful sciences of arithmetic and astronomy, music and geometry, which\r\nhe imbibed so thoroughly as to show they were beneath his talents,\r\nand which, with great perseverance, he revived in Gaul, where they\r\nhad for a long time been wholly obsolete. Being certainly the first\r\nwho seized on the abacus[203] from the Saracens, he gave rules which\r\nare scarcely understood even by laborious computers. He resided with\r\na certain philosopher of that sect, whose good will he had obtained,\r\nfirst by great liberality, and then by promises. The Saracen had no\r\nobjection to sell his knowledge; he frequently associated with him;\r\nwould talk with him of matters at times serious, at others trivial, and\r\nlend him books to transcribe. There was however one volume, containing\r\nthe knowledge of his whole art, which he could never by any means\r\nentice him to lend. In consequence Gerbert was inflamed with anxious\r\ndesire to obtain this book at any rate, “for we ever press more eagerly\r\ntowards what is forbidden, and that which is denied is always esteemed\r\nmost valuable.”[204] Trying, therefore, the effect of entreaty, he\r\nbesought him for the love of God, and by his friendship; offered\r\nhim many things, and promised him more. When this failed he tried a\r\nnocturnal stratagem. He plied him with wine, and, with the help of\r\nhis daughter, who connived at the attempt through the intimacy which\r\nGerbert’s attentions had procured, stole the book from under his pillow\r\nand fled. Waking suddenly, the Saracen pursued the fugitive by the\r\ndirection of the stars, in which art he was well versed. The fugitive\r\ntoo, looking back, and discovering his danger by means of the same art,\r\nhid himself under a wooden bridge which was near at hand; clinging\r\nto it, and hanging in such a manner as neither to touch earth nor\r\nwater.[205] In this manner the eagerness of the pursuer being eluded,\r\nhe returned home. Gerbert, then quickening his pace, arrived at the\r\nsea-coast. Here, by his incantations, he called up the devil, and made\r\nan agreement with him to be under his dominion for ever, if he would\r\ndefend him from the Saracen, who was again pursuing, and transport him\r\nto the opposite coast: this was accordingly done.\r\n\r\nProbably some may regard all this as a fiction, because the vulgar are\r\nused to undermine the fame of scholars, saying that the man who excels\r\nin any admirable science, holds converse with the devil. Of this,\r\nBoethius, in his book, On the Consolation of Philosophy, complains;\r\nand affirms, that he had the discredit of such practices on account\r\nof his ardent love of literature, as if he had polluted his knowledge\r\nby detestable arts for the sake of ambition. “It was hardly likely,”\r\nsays he, “that I, whom you dress up with such excellence as almost to\r\nmake me like God, should catch at the protection of the vilest spirits;\r\nbut it is in this point that we approach nearest to a connection with\r\nthem, in that we are instructed in your learning, and educated in your\r\ncustoms.” So far Boethius. The singular choice of his death confirms\r\nme in the belief of his league with the devil; else, when dying, as we\r\nshall relate hereafter, why should he, gladiator-like, maim his own\r\nperson, unless conscious of some unusual crime? Accordingly, in an old\r\nvolume, which accidentally fell into my hands, wherein the names and\r\nyears of all the popes are entered, I found written to the following\r\npurport, “Silvester, who was also called Gerbert, ten months; this man\r\nmade a shameful end.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1002.] ROBERT, KING OF FRANCE.]\r\n\r\nGerbert, returning into Gaul, became a public professor in the schools,\r\nand had as brother philosophers and companions of his studies,\r\nConstantine, abbat of the monastery of St. Maximin, near Orleans, to\r\nwhom he addressed the Rules of the Abacus;[206] and Ethelbald bishop,\r\nas they say, of Winteburg, who himself gave proof of ability, in a\r\nletter which he wrote to Gerbert, on a question concerning the diameter\r\nin Macrobius,[207] and in some other points. He had as pupils, of\r\nexquisite talents and noble origin, Robert, son of Hugh surnamed Capet;\r\nand Otho, son of the emperor Otho. Robert, afterwards king of France,\r\nmade a suitable return to his master, and appointed him archbishop of\r\nRheims. In that church are still extant, as proofs of his science, a\r\nclock constructed on mechanical principles: and an hydraulic organ, in\r\nwhich the air escaping in a surprising manner, by the force of heated\r\nwater, fills the cavity of the instrument, and the brazen pipes emit\r\nmodulated tones through the multifarious apertures. The king himself,\r\ntoo, was well skilled in sacred music, and in this and many other\r\nrespects, a liberal benefactor to the church: moreover, he composed\r\nthat beautiful sequence, “The grace of the Holy Spirit be with us;”\r\nand the response, “He hath joined together Judah and Jerusalem;”\r\ntogether with more, which I should have pleasure in relating, were\r\nit not irksome to others to hear. Otho, emperor of Italy after his\r\nfather, made Gerbert archbishop of Ravenna, and finally Roman pontiff.\r\nHe followed up his fortune so successfully by the assistance of the\r\ndevil, that he left nothing unexecuted which he had once conceived.\r\nThe treasures formerly buried by the inhabitants, he discovered by the\r\nart of necromancy, and removing the rubbish, applied to his own lusts.\r\nThus viciously disposed are the wicked towards God, and thus they abuse\r\nhis patience, though he had rather that they repent than perish. At\r\nlast, he found where his master would stop, and as the proverb says,\r\n“in the same manner as one crow picks out another crow’s eyes,” while\r\nendeavouring to oppose his attempts with art like his own.\r\n\r\nThere was a statue in the Campus Martius near Rome, I know not whether\r\nof brass or iron, having the forefinger of the right hand extended,\r\nand on the head was written, “Strike here.” The men of former times\r\nsupposing this should be understood as if they might find a treasure\r\nthere, had battered the harmless statue, by repeated strokes of a\r\nhatchet. But Gerbert convicted them of error by solving the problem\r\nin a very different manner. Marking where the shadow of the finger\r\nfell at noon-day, when the sun was on the meridian, he there placed\r\na post; and at night proceeded thither, attended only by a servant\r\ncarrying a lanthorn. The earth opening by means of his accustomed arts,\r\ndisplayed to them a spacious entrance. They see before them a vast\r\npalace with golden walls, golden roofs, every thing of gold; golden\r\nsoldiers amusing themselves, as it were, with golden dice; a king of\r\nthe same metal, at table with his queen; delicacies set before them,\r\nand servants waiting; vessels of great weight and value, where the\r\nsculpture surpassed nature herself. In the inmost part of the mansion,\r\na carbuncle of the first quality, though small in appearance, dispelled\r\nthe darkness of night. In the opposite corner stood a boy, holding a\r\nbow bent, and the arrow drawn to the head. While the exquisite art of\r\nevery thing ravished the eyes of the spectators, there was nothing\r\nwhich might be handled though it might be seen: for immediately,\r\nif any one stretched forth his hand to touch any thing, all these\r\nfigures appeared to rush forward and repel such presumption. Alarmed\r\nat this, Gerbert repressed his inclination: but not so the servant.\r\nHe endeavoured to snatch off from a table, a knife of admirable\r\nworkmanship; supposing that in a booty of such magnitude, so small\r\na theft could hardly be discovered. In an instant, the figures all\r\nstarting up with loud clamour, the boy let fly his arrow at the\r\ncarbuncle, and in a moment all was in darkness; and if the servant had\r\nnot, by the advice of his master, made the utmost despatch in throwing\r\nback the knife, they would have both suffered severely. In this\r\nmanner, their boundless avarice unsatiated, they departed, the lantern\r\ndirecting their steps. That he performed such things by unlawful\r\ndevices is the generally received opinion. Yet, however, if any one\r\ndiligently investigate the truth, he will see that even Solomon, to\r\nwhom God himself had given wisdom, was not ignorant of these arts: for,\r\nas Josephus relates,[208] he, in conjunction with his father, buried\r\nvast treasures in coffers, which were hidden, as he says, in a kind of\r\nnecromantic manner, under ground: neither was Hyrcanus, celebrated for\r\nhis skill in prophecy and his valour; who, to ward off the distress of\r\na siege, dug up, by the same art, three thousand talents of gold from\r\nthe sepulchre of David, and gave part of them to the besiegers; with\r\nthe remainder building an hospital for the reception of strangers.\r\nBut Herod, who would make an attempt of the same kind, with more\r\npresumption than knowledge, lost in consequence many of his attendants,\r\nby an eruption of internal fire. Besides, when I hear the Lord Jesus\r\nsaying, “My father worketh hitherto, and I work;” I believe, that\r\nHe, who gave to Solomon power over demons to such a degree, as the\r\nsame historian declares, that he relates there were men, even in his\r\ntime, who could eject them from persons possessed, by applying to the\r\nnostrils of the patient a ring having the impression pointed out by\r\nSolomon: I believe, I say, that he could give, also, the same science\r\nto this man: but I do not affirm that he did give it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1002.] POPE SILVESTER.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1002.] THE AQUITANIAN MONK.]\r\n\r\nBut leaving these matters to my readers, I shall relate what I\r\nrecollect having heard, when I was a boy, from a certain monk of our\r\nhouse, a native of Aquitaine, a man in years, and a physician by\r\nprofession. “When I was seven years old,” said he, “despising the mean\r\ncircumstances of my father, a poor citizen of Barcelona, I surmounted\r\nthe snowy Alps, and went into Italy. There, as was to be expected in\r\na boy of that age, having to seek my daily bread in great distress, I\r\npaid more attention to the food of my mind than of my body. As I grew\r\nup I eagerly viewed many of the wonders of that country and impressed\r\nthem on my memory. Among others I saw a perforated mountain, beyond\r\nwhich the inhabitants supposed the treasures of Octavian were hidden.\r\nMany persons were reported to have entered into these caverns for the\r\npurpose of exploring them, and to have there perished, being bewildered\r\nby the intricacy of the ways. But, as hardly any apprehension can\r\nrestrain avaricious minds from their intent, I, with my companions,\r\nabout twelve in number, meditated an expedition of this nature, either\r\nfor the sake of plunder, or through curiosity. Imitating therefore\r\nthe ingenuity of Dædalus, who brought Theseus out of the labyrinth by\r\na conducting clue, we, also carrying a large ball of thread, fixed a\r\nsmall post at the entrance. Tying the end of the thread to it, and\r\nlighting lanterns, lest darkness, as well as intricacy, should obstruct\r\nus, we unrolled the clue; and fixing a post at every mile, we proceeded\r\non our journey along the caverns of the mountain, in the best manner\r\nwe were able. Every thing was dark, and full of horrors; the bats,\r\nflitting from holes, assailed our eyes and faces: the path was narrow,\r\nand made dreadful on the left-hand by a precipice, with a river flowing\r\nbeneath it. We saw the way strewed with bare bones: we wept over the\r\ncarcasses of men yet in a state of putrefaction, who, induced by hopes\r\nsimilar to our own, had in vain attempted, after their entrance, to\r\nreturn. After some time, however, and many alarms, arriving at the\r\nfarther outlet, we beheld a lake of softly murmuring waters, where the\r\nwave came gently rolling to the shores. A bridge of brass united the\r\nopposite banks. Beyond the bridge were seen golden horses of great\r\nsize, mounted by golden riders, and all those other things which are\r\nrelated of Gerbert. The mid-day beams of Phœbus darting upon them,\r\nwith redoubled splendour, dazzled the eyes of the beholders. Seeing\r\nthese things at a distance, we should have been delighted with a nearer\r\nview, meaning, if fate would permit, to carry off some portion of\r\nthe precious metal. Animating each other in turn, we prepared to pass\r\nover the lake. All our efforts, however, were vain: for as soon as one\r\nof the company, more forward than the rest, had put his foot on the\r\nhither edge of the bridge, immediately, wonderful to hear, it became\r\ndepressed, and the farther edge was elevated, bringing forward a rustic\r\nof brass with a brazen club, with which, dashing the waters, he so\r\nclouded the air, as completely to obscure both the day and the heavens.\r\nThe moment the foot was withdrawn, peace was restored. The same was\r\ntried by many of us, with exactly the same result. Despairing, then,\r\nof getting over, we stood there some little time; and, as long as we\r\ncould, at least glutted our eyes with the gold. Soon after returning\r\nby the guidance of the thread, we found a silver dish, which being cut\r\nin pieces and distributed in morsels only irritated the thirst of our\r\navidity without allaying it. Consulting together the next day, we went\r\nto a professor, of that time, who was said to know the unutterable name\r\nof God. When questioned, he did not deny his knowledge, adding, that,\r\nso great was the power of that name, that no magic, no witchcraft could\r\nresist it. Hiring him at a great price, fasting and confessed, he led\r\nus, prepared in the same manner, to a fountain. Taking up some water\r\nfrom it in a silver vessel, he silently traced the letters with his\r\nfingers, until we understood by our eyes, what was unutterable with\r\nour tongues. We then went confidently to the mountain, but we found\r\nthe farther outlet beset, as I believe, with devils, hating, forsooth,\r\nthe name of God because it was able to destroy their inventions. In\r\nthe morning a Jew-necromancer came to me, excited by the report of\r\nour attempt; and, having inquired into the matter, when he heard of\r\nour want of enterprise, “You shall see,” said he, venting his spleen\r\nwith loud laughter, “how far the power of my art can prevail.” And\r\nimmediately entering the mountain, he soon after came out again,\r\nbringing, as a proof of his having passed the lake, many things which\r\nI had noted beyond it: indeed some of that most precious dust, which\r\nturned every thing that it touched into gold: not that it was really\r\nso, but only retained this appearance until washed with water; for\r\nnothing effected by necromancy can, when put into water, deceive the\r\nsight of the beholders. The truth of my assertion is confirmed by a\r\ncircumstance which happened about the same time.\r\n\r\n“There were in a public street leading to Rome, two old women, the\r\nmost drunken and filthy beings that can be conceived; both living in\r\nthe same hut, and both practising witchcraft. If any lone stranger\r\nhappened to come in their way, they used to make him appear either a\r\nhorse, or a sow, or some other animal; expose him for sale to dealers,\r\nand gluttonize with the money. By chance, on a certain night, taking\r\nin a lad to lodge who got his livelihood by stage-dancing, they turned\r\nhim into an ass: and so possessed a creature extremely advantageous\r\nto their interests, who caught the eyes of such as passed by the\r\nstrangeness of his postures. In whatever mode the old woman commanded,\r\nthe ass began to dance, for he retained his understanding, though he\r\nhad lost the power of speech. In this manner the women had accumulated\r\nmuch money; for there was, daily, a large concourse of people, from all\r\nparts, to see the tricks of the ass. The report of this induced a rich\r\nneighbour to purchase the quadruped for a considerable sum; and he was\r\nwarned, that, if he would have him as a constant dancer, he must keep\r\nhim from water. The person who had charge of him rigidly fulfilled his\r\norders. A long time elapsed; the ass sometimes gratified his master by\r\nhis reeling motions, and sometimes entertained his friends with his\r\ntricks. But, however, as in time all things surfeit, he began at length\r\nto be less cautiously observed. In consequence of this negligence,\r\nbreaking his halter, he got loose, plunged into a pool hard by, and\r\nrolling for a long time in the water, recovered his human form. The\r\nkeeper, inquiring of all he met, and pursuing him by the track of his\r\nfeet, asked him if he had seen an ass; he replied that himself had\r\nbeen an ass, but was now a man: and related the whole transaction.\r\nThe servant astonished told it to his master, and the master to pope\r\nLeo, the holiest man in our times. The old women were convicted, and\r\nconfessed the fact. The pope doubting this, was assured by Peter\r\nDamian, a learned man, that it was not wonderful that such things\r\nshould be done: he produced the example of Simon Magus,[209] who caused\r\nFaustinianus to assume the figure of Simon, and to become an object of\r\nterror to his sons, and thus rendered his holiness better skilled in\r\nsuch matters for the future.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1050.] DEATH OF SILVESTER.]\r\n\r\nI have inserted this narrative of the Aquitanian to the intent that\r\nwhat is reported of Gerbert should not seem wonderful to any person;\r\nwhich is, that he cast, for his own purposes, the head of a statue,\r\nby a certain inspection of the stars when all the planets were about\r\nto begin their courses, which spake not unless spoken to, but then\r\npronounced the truth, either in the affirmative or negative. For\r\ninstance, when Gerbert would say, “Shall I be pope?” the statue would\r\nreply, “Yes.” “Am I to die, ere I sing mass at Jerusalem?” “No.”\r\nThey relate, that he was so much deceived by this ambiguity, that he\r\nthought nothing of repentance: for when would he think of going to\r\nJerusalem, to accelerate his own death? Nor did he foresee that at Rome\r\nthere is a church called Jerusalem, that is, “the vision of peace,”\r\nbecause whoever flies thither finds safety, whatsoever crime he may\r\nbe guilty of. We have heard, that this was called an asylum in the\r\nvery infancy of the city, because Romulus, to increase the number of\r\nhis subjects, had appointed it to be a refuge for the guilty of every\r\ndescription. The pope sings mass there on three Sundays, which are\r\ncalled “The station at Jerusalem.” Wherefore upon one of those days\r\nGerbert, preparing himself for mass, was suddenly struck with sickness;\r\nwhich increased so that he took to his bed: and consulting his statue,\r\nhe became convinced of his delusion and of his approaching death.\r\nCalling, therefore, the cardinals together, he lamented his crimes for\r\na long space of time. They, being struck with sudden fear were unable\r\nto make any reply, whereupon he began to rave, and losing his reason\r\nthrough excess of pain, commanded himself to be maimed, and cast forth\r\npiecemeal, saying, “Let him have the service of my limbs, who before\r\nsought their homage; for my mind never consented to that abominable\r\noath.”\r\n\r\nAnd since I have wandered from my subject, I think it may not be\r\nunpleasant to relate what took place in Saxony in the time of this\r\nking, in the year of our Lord 1012, and is not so generally known.\r\nIt is better to dilate on such matters than to dwell on Ethelred’s\r\nindolence and calamities: and it will be more pleasing certainly, and\r\nnearer the truth, if I subjoin it in the original language of the\r\nperson who was a sufferer, than if I had clothed it in my own words.\r\nBesides, I think it ornamental to a work, that the style should be\r\noccasionally varied.\r\n\r\n“I Ethelbert,[210] a sinner, even were I desirous of concealing the\r\ndivine judgment which overtook me, yet the tremor of my limbs would\r\nbetray me; wherefore I shall relate circumstantially how this happened,\r\nthat all may know the heavy punishment due to disobedience. We were, on\r\nthe eve of our Lord’s nativity, in a certain town of Saxony, in which\r\nwas the church of Magnus the martyr, and a priest named Robert had\r\nbegun the first mass. I was in the churchyard with eighteen companions,\r\nfifteen men and three women, dancing, and singing profane songs to such\r\na degree that I interrupted the priest, and our voices resounded amid\r\nthe sacred solemnity of the mass. Wherefore, having commanded us to be\r\nsilent, and not being attended to, he cursed us in the following words,\r\n‘May it please God and St. Magnus, that you may remain singing in that\r\nmanner for a whole year.’ His words had their effect. The son of John\r\nthe priest seized his sister who was singing with us, by the arm, and\r\nimmediately tore it from her body; but not a drop of blood flowed out.\r\nShe also remained a whole year with us, dancing and singing. The rain\r\nfell not upon us; nor did cold, nor heat, nor hunger, nor thirst, nor\r\nfatigue assail us: we neither wore our clothes nor shoes, but we kept\r\non singing as though we had been insane. First we sank into the ground\r\nup to our knees: next to our thighs; a covering was at length, by the\r\npermission of God, built over us to keep off the rain. When a year had\r\nelapsed, Herbert, bishop of the city of Cologne, released us from the\r\ntie wherewith our hands were bound, and reconciled us before the altar\r\nof St. Magnus. The daughter of the priest, with the other two women,\r\ndied immediately; the rest of us slept three whole days and nights:\r\nsome died afterwards, and are famed for miracles: the remainder betray\r\ntheir punishment by the trembling of their limbs. This narrative was\r\ngiven to us by the lord Peregrine, the successor of Herbert, in the\r\nyear of our Lord 1013.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1002.] THE ARCHBISHOP OF COLOGNE.]\r\n\r\nIn that city, which formerly was called Agrippina, from Agrippa the\r\nson-in-law of Augustus, but afterwards named Colonia by the emperor\r\nTrajan, because being there created emperor he founded in it a colony\r\nof Roman citizens; in this city, I repeat, there was a certain bishop,\r\nfamed for piety, though to a degree hideous in his person; of whom I\r\nshall relate one miracle, which he predicted when dying, after having\r\nfirst recorded what a singular chance elevated him to such an eminent\r\nstation. The emperor of that country going to hunt on Quinquagesima\r\nSunday, came alone, for his companions were dispersed, to the edge\r\nof a wood, where this rural priest, deformed and almost a monster,\r\nhad a church. The emperor, feigning himself a soldier, humbly begs a\r\nmass, which the priest immediately begins. The other in the meantime\r\nwas revolving in his mind why God, from whom all beautiful things\r\nproceed, should suffer so deformed a man to administer his sacraments.\r\nPresently, when that verse in the tract occurred, “Know ye that the\r\nLord himself is God,” the priest looked behind him, to chide the\r\ninattention of an assistant, and said with a louder voice, as if in\r\nreply to the emperor’s thoughts, “He made us; and not we ourselves.”\r\nStruck with this expression, the emperor esteeming him a prophet,\r\nexalted him, though unwilling and reluctant, to the archbishopric of\r\nCologne, which, when he had once assumed, he dignified by his exemplary\r\nconduct; kindly encouraging those who did well, and branding with the\r\nstigma of excommunication such as did otherwise, without respect of\r\npersons. The inhabitants of that place proclaim a multitude of his\r\nimpartial acts; one of which the reader will peruse in that abbreviated\r\nform which my work requires. In a monastery of nuns in that city, there\r\nwas a certain virgin who had there grown up, more by the kindness of\r\nher parents than through any innate wish for a holy life: this girl,\r\nby the attraction of her beauty and her affable language to all,\r\nallured many lovers; but while others, through fear of God or the\r\ncensure of the world, restrained their desires, there was one who,\r\nexcited to wantonness by the extent of his wealth and the nobility\r\nof his descent, broke through the bounds of law and of justice, and\r\ndespoiled her of her virginity; and carrying her off kept her as his\r\nlawful wife. Much time elapsed while the abbess entreated, and his\r\nfriends admonished him not to persevere in so dreadful a crime. Turning\r\na deaf ear, however, to his advisers, he continued as immoveable as\r\na rock. By chance at this time the prelate was absent, occupied in\r\nbusiness at Rome; but on his return the circumstance was related to\r\nhim. He commands the sheep to be returned to the fold directly; and\r\nafter much altercation the woman was restored to the monastery. Not\r\nlong after, watching an opportunity when the bishop was absent, she\r\nwas again carried away. Excommunication was then denounced against the\r\ndelinquent, so that no person could speak to, or associate with him.\r\nThis, however, he held in contempt, and retired to one of his estates\r\nafar off, not to put the command in force, but to elude its power:\r\nand there, a turbulent and powerful man, he lived in company with his\r\nexcommunicated paramour. But when it pleased God to take the bishop\r\nto himself, and he was lying in extreme bodily pain upon his bed,\r\nthe neighbours flocked around him that they might partake the final\r\nbenediction of this holy man. The offender alone not daring to appear,\r\nprevailed on some persons to speak for him. The moment the bishop\r\nheard his name he groaned, and then, I add his very words, spoke to\r\nthe following effect, “If that wretched man shall desert that accursed\r\nwoman, he shall be absolved; but if he persist, let him be ready to\r\ngive account before God, the following year, at the very day and hour\r\non which I shall depart: moreover, you will see me expire when the\r\nbell shall proclaim the sixth hour.” Nor were his words vain; for he\r\ndeparted at the time which he had predicted; and the other, together\r\nwith his mistress, at the expiration of the year, on the same day, and\r\nat the same hour, was killed by a stroke of lightning.\r\n\r\nBut king Ethelred, after the martyrdom of Elphege, as we have related,\r\ngave his see to a bishop named Living.[211] Moreover, Turkill, the\r\nDane, who had been the chief cause of the archbishop’s murder, had\r\nsettled in England, and held the East Angles in subjection. For the\r\nother Danes, exacting from the English a tribute of eight thousand\r\npounds, had distributed themselves, as best suited their convenience,\r\nin the towns, or in the country; and fifteen of their ships, with the\r\ncrews, had entered into the king’s service. In the meantime Thurkill\r\nsent messengers to Sweyn, king of Denmark, inviting him to come to\r\nEngland; telling him that the land was rich and fertile, but the king\r\na driveller; and that, wholly given up to wine and women, his last\r\nthoughts were those of war: that in consequence he was hateful to his\r\nown people and contemptible to foreigners: that the commanders were\r\njealous of each other, the people weak, and that they would fly the\r\nfield, the moment the onset was sounded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1013.] MASSACRE OF THE DANES.]\r\n\r\nSweyn[212] was naturally cruel, nor did he require much persuasion;\r\npreparing his ships, therefore, he hastened his voyage. Sandwich was\r\nthe port he made, principally designing to avenge his sister Gunhilda.\r\nThis woman, who possessed considerable beauty, had come over to England\r\nwith her husband Palling, a powerful nobleman, and by embracing\r\nChristianity, had made herself a pledge of the Danish peace. In his\r\nill-fated fury, Edric had commanded her, though proclaiming that the\r\nshedding her blood would bring great evil on the whole kingdom, to be\r\nbeheaded with the other Danes. She bore her death with fortitude; and\r\nshe neither turned pale at the moment, nor, when dead, and her blood\r\nexhausted, did she lose her beauty; her husband was murdered before\r\nher face, and her son, a youth of amiable disposition, was transfixed\r\nwith four spears. Sweyn then proceeding through East Anglia against\r\nthe Northumbrians, received their submission without resistance: not\r\nindeed, that the native ardour of their minds, which brooked no master,\r\nhad grown cool, but because Utred, their prince, was the first to give\r\nexample of desertion. On their submission all the other people who\r\ninhabit England on the north, gave him tribute and hostages. Coming\r\nsouthward, he compelled those of Oxford and Winchester, to obey his\r\ncommands; the Londoners alone, protecting their lawful sovereign\r\nwithin their walls, shut their gates against him. The Danes, on the\r\nother hand, assailing with greater ferocity, nurtured their fortitude\r\nwith the hope of fame; the townsmen were ready to rush on death for\r\nfreedom, thinking they ought never to be forgiven, should they desert\r\ntheir king, who had committed his life to their charge. While the\r\nconflict was raging fiercely on either side, victory befriended the\r\njuster cause; for the citizens made wonderful exertions, every one\r\nesteeming it glorious to show his unwearied alacrity to his prince,\r\nor even to die for him. Part of the enemy were destroyed, and part\r\ndrowned in the river Thames, because in their headlong fury, they had\r\nnot sought a bridge. With his shattered army Sweyn retreated to Bath,\r\nwhere Ethelmer, governor of the western district, with his followers,\r\nsubmitted to him. And, although all England was already bending to\r\nhis dominion, yet not even now would the Londoners have yielded, had\r\nnot Ethelred withdrawn his presence from among them. For being a man\r\ngiven up to indolence, and, through consciousness of his own misdeeds,\r\nsupposing none could be faithful to him, and at the same time wishing\r\nto escape the difficulties of a battle and a siege, he by his departure\r\nleft them to their own exertions. However, they applied the best remedy\r\nthey could to their exigencies, and surrendered after the example of\r\ntheir countrymen. They were men laudable in the extreme, and such as\r\nMars himself would not have disdained to encounter, had they possessed\r\na competent leader. Even while they were supported by the mere shadow\r\nof one, they risked every chance of battle, nay even a siege of several\r\nmonths’ continuance. He in the meantime giving fresh instance of his\r\nconstitutional indolence, fled from the city, and by secret journeys\r\ncame to Southampton, whence he passed over to the Isle of Wight. Here\r\nhe addressed those abbats and bishops who, even in such difficulties,\r\ncould not bring themselves to desert their master, to the following\r\neffect: “That they must perceive in what dreadful state his affairs,\r\nand those of his family were; that he was banished from his paternal\r\nthrone by the treachery of his generals, and that he, in whose hands\r\ntheir safety was formerly vested, now required the assistance of\r\nothers; that though lately a monarch and a potentate, he was now\r\nan outcast and a fugitive; a melancholy change for him, because it\r\ncertainly is more tolerable never to have had power, than to have lost\r\nit when possessed; and more especially disgraceful to the English, as\r\nthis instance of deserting their prince would be noised throughout the\r\nworld; that through mere regard to him they had exposed their houses\r\nand property to plunderers, and, unprovided, taken to a voluntary\r\nflight; food was matter of difficulty to all; many had not even\r\nclothing; he commended their fidelity indeed, but still could find no\r\nsecurity from it; the country was now so completely subdued, the coast\r\nso narrowly watched, that there was no escape unattended with danger:\r\nthat they should, therefore, confer together, what was to be done:\r\nwere they to remain, greater peril was to be apprehended from their\r\ncountrymen, than from their enemies, for perhaps they might purchase\r\nthe favour of their new master by joining to distress them; and\r\ncertainly to be killed by an enemy was to be ascribed to fortune, to be\r\nbetrayed by a fellow citizen was to be attributed to want of exertion;\r\nwere they to fly to distant nations, it would be with the loss of\r\nhonour; if to those who knew them, the dread would be, lest their\r\ndispositions should take a tinge from their reverse of fortune; for\r\nmany great and illustrious men had been killed on similar occasions;\r\nbut, however, he must make the experiment, and sound the inclinations\r\nof Richard, duke of Normandy, who, if he should kindly receive his\r\nsister and nephews, might probably not unwillingly afford him his\r\nprotection. His favour shown to my wife and children,” continued he,\r\n“will be the pledge of my own security. Should he oppose me, I am\r\nconfident, nay fully confident, I shall not want spirit to die here\r\nwith honour, in preference to living there with ignominy. Wherefore\r\nthis very month of August, while milder gales are soothing the ocean,\r\nlet Emma make a voyage to her brother, and take our children, our\r\ncommon pledges, to be deposited with him. Let their companions be the\r\nbishop of Durham and the abbat of Peterborough; I myself will remain\r\nhere till Christmas, and should he send back a favourable answer, I\r\nwill follow directly.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1013.] ETHELRED’S CONFERENCE.]\r\n\r\nOn the breaking up of the conference, all obeyed; they set sail for\r\nNormandy, while he remained anxiously expecting a favourable report.\r\nShortly after he learned from abroad, that Richard had received his\r\nsister with great affection, and that he invited the king also to\r\ncondescend to become his inmate. Ethelred, therefore, going into\r\nNormandy, in the month of January, felt his distresses soothed by\r\nthe attentions of his host. This Richard was son of Richard the\r\nfirst, and equalled his father in good fortune and good qualities;\r\nthough he certainly surpassed him in heavenly concerns. He completed\r\nthe monastery at Feschamp, which his father had begun. He was more\r\nintent on prayer and temperance, than you would require in any monk,\r\nor hermit. He was humble to excess, in order that he might subdue by\r\nhis patience, the petulance of those who attacked him. Moreover it\r\nis reported, that at night, secretly escaping the observation of his\r\nservants, he was accustomed to go unattended to the matins[213] of\r\nthe monks, and to continue in prayer till day-light. Intent on this\r\npractice, one night in particular, at Feschamp, he was earlier than\r\ncustomary, and finding the door shut, he forced it open with unusual\r\nviolence, and disturbed the sleep of the sacristan. He, astonished at\r\nthe noise of a person knocking in the dead of night, got up, that he\r\nmight see the author of so bold a deed; and finding only a countryman\r\nin appearance, clothed in rustic garb, he could not refrain from laying\r\nhands on him; and, moved with vehement indignation, he caught hold of\r\nhis hair, and gave this illustrious man a number of severe blows, which\r\nhe bore with incredible patience, and without uttering a syllable.\r\nThe next day, Richard laid his complaint before the chapter,[214] and\r\nwith counterfeited anger, summoned the monk to meet him at the town of\r\nArgens, threatening that, “he would take such vengeance for the injury,\r\nso that all France should talk of it.” On the day appointed, while the\r\nmonk stood by, almost dead with fear, he detailed the matter to the\r\nnobility, largely exaggerating the enormity of the transaction, and\r\nkeeping the culprit in suspense, by crafty objections to what he urged\r\nin mitigation. Finally, after he had been mercifully judged by the\r\nnobility, he pardoned him; and to make his forgiveness more acceptable,\r\nhe annexed all that town, with its appurtenances, reported to be\r\nabundant in the best wine, to the office of this sacristan: saying,\r\n“That he was an admirable monk, who properly observed his appointed\r\ncharge, and did not break silence, though roused with anger.” In the\r\ntwenty-eighth year of his dukedom, he died, having ordered his body to\r\nbe buried at the door of the church, where it would be subjected to the\r\nfeet of such as passed by, and to the spouts of water which streamed\r\nfrom above. In our time, however, William, third abbat of that place,\r\nregarding this as disgraceful, removed the long-continued reproach, and\r\ntaking up the body, placed it before the high altar. He had a brother,\r\nRobert, whom he made archbishop of Rouen, though by this he tarnished\r\nhis reputation. For he, cruelly abusing this honour, at first,\r\ncommitted many crimes and many atrocious acts; but growing in years,\r\nhe certainly wiped off some of them by his very liberal almsgiving.\r\nAfter Richard, his son of the same name obtained the principality, but\r\nlived scarcely a year. A vague opinion indeed has prevailed, that, by\r\nthe connivance of his brother Robert, whom Richard the second begat on\r\nJudith, daughter of Conan, earl of Brittany, a certain woman, skilled\r\nin poisons, took the young man off. In atonement for his privity to\r\nthis transaction he departed for Jerusalem, after the seventh year of\r\nhis earldom; venturing on an undertaking very meritorious at that time,\r\nby commencing, with few followers, a journey, exposed to incursions of\r\nbarbarians, and strange, by reason of the customs of the Saracens. He\r\npersevered nevertheless, and did not stop, but safely completed the\r\nwhole distance, and purchasing admission at a high price, with bare\r\nfeet, and full of tears, he worshipped at that glory of the Christians,\r\nthe sepulchre of our Lord. Conciliating the favour of God, as we\r\nbelieve, by this labour, on his return homewards he ended his days at\r\nNice, a city of Bithynia; cut off, as it is said, by poison. This was\r\nadministered by his servant Ralph, surnamed Mowin, who had wrought\r\nhimself up to the commission of this crime, from a hope of obtaining\r\nthe dukedom. But on his return to Normandy, the matter becoming known\r\nto all, he was detested as a monster, and retired to perpetual exile.\r\nTo Robert succeeded William, his son, then a child, of whom as I shall\r\nhave to speak hereafter, I shall now return to my narrative.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1013.] THE DUKES OF NORMANDY.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Sweyn, as I have before related, oppressed England\r\nwith rapine and with slaughter: the inhabitants were first plundered\r\nof their property, and then proscribed. In every city it was matter of\r\ndoubt what should be done: if revolt was determined on, they had none\r\nto take the lead; if submission was made choice of, they would have\r\na harsh ruler to deal with. Thus their public and private property,\r\ntogether with their hostages, was carried to the fleet; as he was not\r\na lawful sovereign, but a most cruel tyrant. The Deity, however, was\r\ntoo kind to permit England to fluctuate long in such keen distress, for\r\nthe invader died shortly after, on the purification of St. Mary,[215]\r\nthough it is uncertain by what death. It is reported, that while\r\ndevastating the possessions of St. Edmund,[216] king and martyr, he\r\nappeared to him in a vision, and gently addressed him on the misery of\r\nhis people; that on Sweyn’s replying insolently, he struck him on the\r\nhead; and that, in consequence of the blow, he died, as has been said,\r\nimmediately after. The Danes then elected Canute, the son of Sweyn,\r\nking; while the Angles, declaring that their natural sovereign was\r\ndearer to them, if he could conduct himself more royally than he had\r\nhitherto done, sent for king Ethelred out of Normandy. He despatched\r\nEdward, his son, first, to sound the fidelity of the higher orders\r\nand the inclination of the people, on the spot; who, when he saw the\r\nwishes of all tending in his favour, went back in full confidence for\r\nhis father. The king returned, and, being flattered by the joyful\r\nplaudits of the Angles, that he might appear to have shaken off his\r\nconstitutional indolence, he hastened to collect an army against\r\nCanute, who was at that time in Lindsey, where his father had left him\r\nwith the ships and hostages, and was levying fresh troops and horses,\r\nthat, mustering a sufficient force, he might make a vigorous attack\r\nupon his enemies unprepared: vowing most severe vengeance, as he used\r\nto say, on the deserters. But, circumvented by a contrivance similar\r\nto his own, he retreated. Escaping at that time with much difficulty,\r\nand putting to sea with his remaining forces, he coasted the British\r\nocean from east to south, and landed at Sandwich. Here, setting all\r\ndivine and human laws at defiance, he mutilated his hostages, who were\r\nyoung men of great nobility and elegance, by depriving them of their\r\nears, and nostrils, and some even of their manhood. Thus tyrannizing\r\nover the innocent, and boasting of the feat, he returned to his own\r\ncountry. In the same year the sea-flood, which the Greeks call Euripus,\r\nand we Ledo,[217] rose to so wonderful a height, that none like it was\r\nrecollected in the memory of man, for it overflowed the villages, and\r\ndestroyed their inhabitants, for many miles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1015.] COUNCIL AT OXFORD.]\r\n\r\nThe year following a grand council of Danes and English, was assembled\r\nat Oxford, where the king commanded two of the noblest Danes,\r\nSigeferth, and Morcar, accused of treachery to him by the impeachment\r\nof the traitor Edric, to be put to death. He had lured them, by his\r\nsoothing expressions, into a chamber, and deprived them, when drunk\r\nto excess, of their lives, by his attendants who had been prepared\r\nfor that purpose. The cause of their murder was said to be, his\r\nunjustifiable desire for their property. Their dependants, attempting\r\nto revenge the death of their lords by arms, were worsted, and driven\r\ninto the tower of St. Frideswide’s church at Oxford, where, as they\r\ncould not be dislodged, they were consumed by fire: however, shortly\r\nafter, the foul stain was wiped out by the king’s penitence, and the\r\nsacred place repaired. I have read the history of this transaction,\r\nwhich is deposited in the archives of that church. The wife of\r\nSigeferth, a woman remarkable for her rank and beauty, was carried\r\nprisoner to Malmesbury; on which account, Edmund, the king’s son,\r\ndissembling his intention, took a journey into those parts. Seeing her,\r\nhe became enamoured; and becoming enamoured, he made her his wife;\r\ncautiously keeping their union secret from his father, who was as\r\nmuch an object of contempt to his family as to strangers. This Edmund\r\nwas not born of Emma, but of some other person, whom fame has left in\r\nobscurity. With that exception, he was a young man in every respect of\r\nnoble disposition; of great strength both of mind and person, and, on\r\nthis account, by the English, called “Ironside:” he would have shrouded\r\nthe indolence of his father, and the meanness of his mother, by his own\r\nconspicuous virtue, could the fates have spared him. Soon after, at\r\nthe instigation of his wife, he asked of his father the possessions\r\nof Sigeferth, which were of large extent among the Northumbrians, but\r\ncould not obtain them; by his own exertions, however, he procured them\r\nat last, the inhabitants of that province willingly submitting to his\r\npower.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1016.] DEATH OF ETHELRED.]\r\n\r\nThe same summer Canute, having settled his affairs in Denmark, and\r\nentered into alliance with the neighbouring kings, came to England,\r\ndetermined to subdue it or perish in the attempt. Proceeding from\r\nSandwich into Kent, and thence into West Saxony, he laid every thing\r\nwaste with fire and slaughter, while the king was lying sick at\r\nCosham.[218] Edmund indeed attempted to oppose him, but being thwarted\r\nby Edric, he placed his forces in a secure situation. Edric, however,\r\nthinking it unnecessary longer to dissemble, but that he might, now,\r\nopenly throw off the mask, revolted to Canute with forty ships, and\r\nall West Saxony following his example, delivered hostages, and gave up\r\ntheir arms. Yet the Mercians repeatedly assembling stood forward to\r\nresist: and if the king would but come, and command whither they were\r\nto march, and bring with him the leading men of London, they were ready\r\nto shed their blood for their country. But he, accustomed to commit\r\nhis safety to fortifications, and not to attack the enemy, remained\r\nin London; never venturing out, for fear, as he said, of traitors.\r\nOn the contrary, Canute was gaining towns and villages over to his\r\nparty; and was never unemployed; for he held consultations by night,\r\nand fought battles by day. Edmund, after long deliberation, esteeming\r\nit best, in such an emergency, to recover, if possible, the revolted\r\ncities by arms, brought over Utred, an earl, on the other side of the\r\nHumber, to the same sentiments. They imagined too, that such cities\r\nas were yet doubtful which side to take, would determine at once, if\r\nthey would only inflict signal vengeance on those which had revolted.\r\nBut Canute, possessed of equal penetration, circumvented them by a\r\nsimilar contrivance. Giving over the West Saxons and that part of\r\nMercia which he had subjugated, to the custody of his generals, he\r\nproceeded himself against the Northumbrians; and, by depopulating the\r\ncountry, compelled Utred to retire, to defend his own possessions; and\r\nnotwithstanding he surrendered himself, yet with inhuman levity he\r\nordered him to be put to death. His earldom was given to Eric, whom\r\nCanute afterwards expelled England, because he pretended to equal power\r\nwith himself. Thus all being subdued, he ceased not pursuing Edmund,\r\nwho was gradually retreating, till he heard that he was at London with\r\nhis father. Canute then remained quiet till after Easter, that he might\r\nattack the city with all his forces. But the death of Ethelred preceded\r\nthe attempt: for in the beginning of Lent, on St. Gregory’s day,[219]\r\nhe breathed out a life destined only to labours and misery: he lies\r\nburied at St. Paul’s in London. The citizens immediately proclaimed\r\nEdmund king, who, mustering an army, routed the Danes at Penn,[220]\r\nnear Gillingham, about Rogation-day. After the festival of St. John,\r\nengaging them again at Sceorstan,[221] he retired from a drawn-battle.\r\nThe English had begun to give way, at the instance of Edric; who being\r\non the adversaries’ side, and holding in his hand a sword stained\r\nwith the blood of a fellow whom he had dexterously slain, exclaimed,\r\n“Fly, wretches! fly! behold, your king was slain by this sword!” The\r\nAngles would have fled immediately, had not the king, apprised of this\r\ncircumstance, proceeded to an eminence, and taking off his helmet,\r\nshown his face to his comrades. Then brandishing a dart with all his\r\nforces, he launched it at Edric; but being seen, and avoided, it missed\r\nhim, and struck a soldier standing near; and so great was its violence,\r\nthat it even transfixed a second. Night put a stop to the battle, the\r\nhostile armies retreating as if by mutual consent, though the English\r\nhad well-nigh obtained the victory.\r\n\r\nAfter this the sentiments of the West Saxons changed, and they\r\nacknowledged their lawful sovereign. Edmund proceeded to London,\r\nthat he might liberate those deserving citizens whom a party of the\r\nenemy had blocked up immediately after his departure; moreover they\r\nhad surrounded the whole city, on the parts not washed by the river\r\nThames, with a trench; and many men lost their lives on both sides in\r\nthe skirmishes. Hearing of the king’s approach, they precipitately\r\ntook to flight; while he pursuing directly, and passing the ford called\r\nBrentford, routed them with great slaughter. The remaining multitude\r\nwhich were with Canute, while Edmund was relaxing a little and getting\r\nhis affairs in order, again laid siege to London both on the land and\r\nriver side; but being nobly repulsed by the citizens, they wreaked\r\ntheir anger on the neighbouring province of Mercia, laying waste the\r\ntowns and villages, with plunder, fire, and slaughter. The best of the\r\nspoil was conveyed to their ships assembled in the Medway; which river\r\nflowing by the city of Rochester, washes its fair walls with a strong\r\nand rapid current. They were attacked and driven hence also by the king\r\nin person; who suddenly seizing the ford, which I have before mentioned\r\nat Brentford,[222] dispersed them with signal loss.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1016.] BATTLE OF ASSINGDON.]\r\n\r\nWhile Edmund was preparing to pursue, and utterly destroy the last\r\nremains of these plunderers, he was prevented by the crafty and\r\nabandoned Edric, who had again insinuated himself into his good graces;\r\nfor he had come over to Edmund, at the instigation of Canute, that he\r\nmight betray his designs. Had the king only persevered, this would have\r\nbeen the last day for the Danes; but misled by the insinuations of a\r\ntraitor, who affirmed that the enemy would make no farther attempt,\r\nhe brought swift destruction upon himself, and the whole of England.\r\nBeing thus allowed to escape, they again assembled; attacked the East\r\nAngles, and, at Assandun,[223] compelled the king himself, who came to\r\ntheir assistance, to retreat. Here again, the person I am ashamed to\r\nmention so frequently, designedly gave the first example of flight. A\r\nsmall number, who, mindful of their former fame, and encouraging each\r\nother, had formed a compact body, were cut off to a man. On this field\r\nof battle Canute gained the kingdom; the glory of the Angles fell; and\r\nthe whole flower of the country withered. Amongst these was Ulfkytel,\r\nearl of East Anglia, who had gained immortal honour in the time of\r\nSweyn, when first attacking the pirates, he showed that they might\r\nbe overcome: here fell, too, the chief men of the day, both bishops\r\nand abbats. Edmund flying hence almost alone, came to Gloucester,\r\nin order that he might there re-assemble his forces, and attack the\r\nenemy, indolent, as he supposed, from their recent victory. Nor was\r\nCanute wanting in courage to pursue the fugitive. When everything\r\nwas ready for battle, Edmund demanded a single combat; that two\r\nindividuals might not, for the lust of dominion, be stained with the\r\nblood of so many subjects, when they might try their fortune without\r\nthe destruction of their faithful adherents: and observing, that it\r\nmust redound greatly to the credit of either to have obtained so vast a\r\ndominion at his own personal peril. But Canute refused this proposition\r\naltogether; affirming that his courage was surpassing, but that he was\r\napprehensive of trusting his diminutive person against so bulky an\r\nantagonist: wherefore, as both had equal pretensions to the kingdom,\r\nsince the father of either of them had possessed it, it was consistent\r\nwith prudence that they should lay aside their animosity, and divide\r\nEngland.[224] This proposition was adopted by either army, and\r\nconfirmed with much applause, both for its equity and its beneficent\r\nregard to the repose of the people who were worn out with continual\r\nsuffering. In consequence, Edmund, overcome by the general clamour,\r\nmade peace, and entered into treaty with Canute, retaining West Saxony\r\nhimself and giving Mercia to the other. He died soon after on the\r\nfestival of St. Andrew,[225] though by what mischance is not known, and\r\nwas buried at Glastonbury near his grandfather Edgar. Fame asperses\r\nEdric, as having, through regard for Canute, compassed his death by\r\nmeans of his servants: reporting that there were two attendants on the\r\nking to whom he had committed the entire care of his person, and, that\r\nEdric seducing them by promises, at length made them his accomplices,\r\nthough at first they were struck with horror at the enormity of the\r\ncrime; and that, at his suggestion, they drove an iron hook into his\r\nposteriors, as he was sitting down for a necessary purpose. Edwin,\r\nhis brother on the mother’s side, a youth of amiable disposition, was\r\ndriven from England by Edric, at the command of Canute, and suffering\r\nextremely for a considerable time, “both by sea and land,” his body, as\r\nis often the case, became affected by the anxiety of his mind, and he\r\ndied in England, where he lay concealed after a clandestine return, and\r\nlies buried at Tavistock. His sons, Edwy and Edward, were sent to the\r\nking of Sweden to be put to death; but being preserved by his mercy,\r\nthey went to the king of Hungary, where, after being kindly treated\r\nfor a time, the elder died; and the younger married Agatha, the sister\r\nof the queen. His brothers by Emma, Alfred and Edward, lay securely\r\nconcealed in Normandy for the whole time that Canute lived.\r\n\r\nI find that their uncle Richard took no steps to restore them to their\r\ncountry: on the contrary, he married his sister Emma to the enemy\r\nand invader; and it may be difficult to say, whether to the greater\r\nignominy of him who bestowed her, or of the woman who consented to\r\nshare the nuptial couch of that man who had so cruelly molested her\r\nhusband, and had driven her children into exile. Robert, however, whom\r\nwe have so frequently before mentioned as having gone to Jerusalem,\r\nassembling a fleet and embarking soldiers, made ready an expedition,\r\nboasting that he would set the crown on the heads of his grand-nephews;\r\nand doubtlessly he would have made good his assertion, had not, as we\r\nhave heard from our ancestors, an adverse wind constantly opposed him:\r\nbut assuredly this was by the hidden counsel of God, in whose disposal\r\nare the powers of all kingdoms. The remains of the vessels, decayed\r\nthrough length of time, were still to be seen at Rouen in our days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\n_Of king Canute._ [A.D. 1017-1031.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1017.] OF KING CANUTE.]\r\n\r\nCanute began to reign in the year of our Lord 1017, and reigned twenty\r\nyears. Though he obtained the sovereignty unjustly, yet he conducted\r\nhimself with great affability and firmness. At his entrance on the\r\ngovernment, dividing the kingdom into four parts, himself took the\r\nWest Saxons, Edric the Mercians, Thurkill the East Angles, and Eric\r\nthe Northumbrians. His first care was to punish the murderers of\r\nEdmund, who had, under expectation of great recompence, acknowledged\r\nthe whole circumstances: he concealed them for a time, and then brought\r\nthem forward in a large assembly of the people, where they confessed\r\nthe mode of their attack upon him, and were immediately ordered to\r\nexecution. The same year, Edric, whom words are wanting to stigmatize\r\nas he deserved, being, by the king’s command, entrapped in the same\r\nsnare which he had so frequently laid for others, breathed out his\r\nabominable spirit to hell. For a quarrel arising, while they were\r\nangrily discoursing, Edric, relying on the credit of his services, and\r\namicably, as it were, reproaching the king, said, “I first deserted\r\nEdmund for your sake, and afterwards even despatched him in consequence\r\nof my engagements to you.” At this expression the countenance of Canute\r\nchanged with indignation, and he instantly pronounced this sentence:\r\n“Thou shalt die,” said he, “and justly; since thou art guilty of\r\ntreason both to God and me, by having killed thy own sovereign, and\r\nmy sworn brother; thy blood be upon thy head, because thy mouth hath\r\nspoken against thee, and thou hast lifted thy hand against the Lord’s\r\nanointed:” and immediately, that no tumult might be excited, the\r\ntraitor was strangled in the chamber where they sat, and thrown out\r\nof the window into the river Thames: thus meeting the just reward of\r\nhis perfidy. In process of time, as opportunities occurred, Thurkill\r\nand Eric were driven out of the kingdom, and sought their native land.\r\nThe first, who had been the instigator of the murder of St. Elphege,\r\nwas killed by the chiefs the moment he touched the Danish shore.[226]\r\nWhen all England, by these means, became subject to Canute alone, he\r\nbegan to conciliate the Angles with unceasing diligence; allowing\r\nthem equal rights with the Danes, in their assemblies, councils, and\r\narmies: on which account, as I have before observed, he sent for the\r\nwife of the late king out of Normandy, that, while they were paying\r\nobedience to their accustomed sovereign, they should the less repine\r\nat the dominion of the Danes. Another design he had in view by this,\r\nwas, to acquire favour with Richard; who would think little of his\r\nnephews, so long as he supposed he might have others by Canute. He\r\nrepaired, throughout England, the monasteries, which had been partly\r\ninjured, and partly destroyed by the military incursions of himself,\r\nor of his father; he built churches in all the places where he had\r\nfought, and more particularly at Assingdon, and appointed ministers\r\nto them, who, through the succeeding revolutions of ages, might pray\r\nto God for the souls of the persons there slain. At the consecration\r\nof this edifice, himself was present, and the English and Danish\r\nnobility made their offerings: it is now, according to report, an\r\nordinary church, under the care of a parish priest. Over the body of\r\nthe most holy Edmund, whom the Danes of former times had killed, he\r\nbuilt a church with princely magnificence, appointed to it an abbat,\r\nand monks: and conferred on it many large estates. The greatness of\r\nhis donation, yet entire, stands proudly eminent at the present day;\r\nfor that place surpasses almost all the monasteries of England. He\r\ntook up, with his own hands, the body of St. Elphege, which had been\r\nburied at St. Paul’s in London, and sending it to Canterbury, honoured\r\nit with due regard. Thus anxious to atone for the offences of himself\r\nor of his predecessors, perhaps he wiped away the foul stain of his\r\nformer crimes with God: certainly he did so with man. At Winchester,\r\nhe displayed all the magnificence of his liberality: here he gave so\r\nlargely, that the quantity of precious metals astonished the minds\r\nof strangers; and the glittering of jewels dazzled the eyes of the\r\nbeholders: this was at Emma’s suggestion, who with pious prodigality\r\nexhausted his treasures in works of this kind, while he was meditating\r\nfierce attacks on foreign lands. For his valour, incapable of rest, and\r\nnot contented with Denmark, which he held from his father, and England,\r\nwhich he possessed by right of war, transferred its rage against the\r\nSwedes. These people are contiguous to the Danes, and had excited the\r\ndispleasure of Canute by their ceaseless hostility. At first he fell\r\ninto an ambush, and lost many of his people, but afterwards recruiting\r\nhis strength, he routed his opponents, and brought the kings of that\r\nnation, Ulf and Eglaf, to terms of peace. The English, at the instance\r\nof earl Godwin, behaved nobly in this conflict. He exhorted them, not\r\nto forget their ancient fame, but clearly to display their valour to\r\ntheir new lord: telling them, that it must be imputed to fortune,\r\nthat they had formerly been conquered by him, but it would be ascribed\r\nto their courage, if they overcame those who had overcome him. In\r\nconsequence, the English put forth all their strength, and gaining\r\nthe victory, obtained an earldom for their commander, and honour for\r\nthemselves. Thence, on his return home, he entirely subdued the kingdom\r\nof Norway, putting Olave, its king, to flight; who, the year following,\r\nreturning with a small party into his kingdom, to try the inclinations\r\nof the inhabitants, found them faithless, and was slain with his\r\nadherents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1030, 1031.] CANUTE’S EPISTLE.]\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth year of his reign, Canute went to Rome, and after\r\nremaining there some time, and atoning for his crimes by giving alms to\r\nthe several churches, he sailed back to England.[227] Soon after, with\r\nlittle difficulty, he subdued Scotland, then in a state of rebellion,\r\nand Malcolm her king, by leading an army thither. I trust it will not\r\nappear useless, if I subjoin the epistle, which he transmitted to the\r\nEnglish, on his departure from Rome, by the hands of Living, abbat\r\nof Tavistock, and afterwards bishop of Crediton, to exemplify his\r\nreformation of life, and his princely magnificence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1031.] CANUTE’S EPISTLE.]\r\n\r\n“_Canute, king of all England, Denmark, Norway, and part of the Swedes,\r\nto Ethelnoth, metropolitan, and Elfric archbishop of York, and to\r\nall bishops, nobles, and to the whole nation of the English high and\r\nlow, health._ I notify to you, that I have lately been to Rome, to\r\npray for the forgiveness of my sins; for the safety of my dominions,\r\nand of the people under my government. I had long since vowed such a\r\njourney to God, but, hitherto hindered by the affairs of my kingdom,\r\nand other causes preventing, I was unable to accomplish it sooner. I\r\nnow return thanks most humbly to my Almighty God, for suffering me,\r\nin my lifetime, to approach the holy apostles Peter and Paul, and all\r\nthe holy saints within and without the city of Rome, wherever I could\r\ndiscover them, and there, present, to worship and adore according to\r\nmy desire. I have been the more diligent in the performance of this,\r\nbecause I have learned from the wise, that St. Peter, the apostle,\r\nhas received from God, great power in binding and in loosing: that\r\nhe carries the key of the kingdom of heaven; and consequently I have\r\njudged it matter of special importance to seek his influence with God.\r\nBe it known to you, that at the solemnity of Easter, a great assembly\r\nof nobles was present with pope John, and the emperor Conrad, that\r\nis to say, all the princes of the nations from mount Garganus[228]\r\nto the neighbouring sea. All these received me with honour, and\r\npresented me with magnificent gifts. But more especially was I\r\nhonoured by the emperor, with various gifts and offerings, in gold\r\nand silver vessels, and palls and costly garments. Moreover, I spoke\r\nwith the emperor himself, and the sovereign pope and the nobles who\r\nwere there, concerning the wants of all my people, English as well as\r\nDanes; observing that there ought to be granted to them more equitable\r\nregulations, and greater security on their passage to Rome; that\r\nthey should not be impeded by so many barriers[229] on the road, nor\r\nharassed with unjust exactions. The emperor assented to my request, as\r\ndid Rodolph the king, who has the chief dominion over those barriers;\r\nand all the princes confirmed by an edict, that my subjects, traders,\r\nas well as those who went on a religious account, should peaceably go\r\nand return from Rome, without any molestation from warders of barriers,\r\nor tax-gatherers. Again I complained before the pope, and expressed my\r\nhigh displeasure, that my archbishops were oppressed by the immense\r\nsum of money which is demanded from them when seeking, according to\r\ncustom, the apostolical residence to receive the pall: and it was\r\ndetermined that it should be so no longer. Moreover, all things which\r\nI requested for the advantage of my kingdom, from the sovereign pope,\r\nand the emperor, and king Rodolph, and the other princes, through whose\r\nterritories our road to Rome is situated, they have freely granted,\r\nand confirmed by oath, under the attestation of four archbishops, and\r\ntwenty bishops, and an innumerable multitude of dukes and nobles who\r\nwere present. Wherefore I give most hearty thanks to God Almighty, for\r\nhaving successfully completed all that I had wished, in the manner I\r\nhad designed, and fully satisfied my intentions. Be it known then, that\r\nsince I have vowed to God himself, henceforward to reform my life in\r\nall things, and justly, and piously to govern the kingdoms and the\r\npeople subject to me, and to maintain equal justice in all things;\r\nand have determined, through God’s assistance, to rectify any thing\r\nhitherto unjustly done, either through the intemperance of my youth,\r\nor through negligence; therefore I call to witness, and command my\r\ncounsellors, to whom I have entrusted the counsels of the kingdom,\r\nthat they by no means, either through fear of myself, or favour to any\r\npowerful person, suffer, henceforth, any injustice, or cause such,\r\nto be done in all my kingdom. Moreover, I command all sheriffs, or\r\ngovernors throughout my whole kingdom, as they tender my affection,\r\nor their own safety, not to commit injustice towards any man, rich or\r\npoor, but to allow all, noble and ignoble, alike to enjoy impartial\r\nlaw, from which they are never to deviate, either on account of royal\r\nfavour, the person of any powerful man, or for the sake of amassing\r\nmoney for myself: for I have no need to accumulate money by unjust\r\nexaction. Be it known to you therefore, that returning by the same\r\nway that I went, I am now going to Denmark, through the advice of all\r\nthe Danes, to make peace and firm treaty with those nations, who were\r\ndesirous, had it been possible, to deprive me both of life and of\r\nsovereignty: this, however, they were not able to perform, God, who by\r\nhis kindness preserves me in my kingdom and in my honour, and destroys\r\nthe power of all my adversaries, bringing their strength to nought.\r\nMoreover, when I have established peace with the surrounding nations,\r\nand put all our sovereignty here in the East in tranquil order, so that\r\nthere shall be no fear of war or enmity on any side, I intend coming\r\nto England, as early in the summer as I shall be able to get my fleet\r\nprepared. I have sent this epistle before me, in order that my people\r\nmay rejoice at my prosperity; because, as yourselves know, I have never\r\nspared, nor will I spare, either myself or my pains for the needful\r\nservice of my whole people. I now therefore adjure all my bishops, and\r\ngovernors, throughout my kingdom, by the fidelity they owe to God and\r\nme, to take care that, before I come to England, all dues owing by\r\nancient custom be discharged: that is to say, plough-alms,[230] the\r\ntenth of animals born in the current year,[231] and the pence owing to\r\nRome for St. Peter, whether from cities or villages: and in the middle\r\nof August, the tenth of the produce of the earth: and on the festival\r\nof St. Martin, the first fruits of seeds, to the church of the parish\r\nwhere each one resides, which is called in English ‘Circscet.’[232] If\r\nthese and such like things are not paid before I come to England, all\r\nwho shall have offended will incur the penalty of a royal mulct,[233]\r\nto be exacted without remission, according to law.” Nor was this\r\ndeclaration without effect; for he commanded all the laws which had\r\nbeen enacted by ancient kings, and chiefly by his predecessor Ethelred,\r\nto be observed for ever, under the penalty of a royal mulct: in the\r\nobservance of which,[234] the custom even at the present day, in the\r\ntime of good kings, is to swear by the name of king Edward, not that he\r\nindeed appointed, but that he observed them.\r\n\r\nAt that time there were in England very great and learned men, the\r\nprincipal of whom was Ethelnoth, archbishop after Living. He was\r\nappointed primate from being dean,[235] and performed many works truly\r\nworthy to be recorded: encouraging even the king himself in his good\r\nactions by the authority of his sanctity, and restraining him in his\r\nexcesses: he first exalted the archiepiscopal cathedral by the presence\r\nof the body of St. Elphege, and afterwards personally at Rome, restored\r\nit to its pristine dignity.[236] Returning home, he transmitted to\r\nCoventry the arm of St. Augustine[237] the teacher, which he had\r\npurchased at Pavia, for an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of\r\ngold. Moreover, Canute took a journey to the church of Glastonbury,\r\nthat he might visit the remains of his brother Edmund, as he used to\r\ncall him; and praying over his tomb, he presented a pall, interwoven,\r\nas it appeared, with party-coloured figures of peacocks. Near the\r\nking stood the before-named Ethelnoth, who was the seventh monk of\r\nGlastonbury that had become archbishop of Canterbury: first Berthwald:\r\nsecond Athelm, first bishop of Wells: third his nephew Dunstan: fourth\r\nEthelgar, first abbat of the New-minster at Winchester, and then bishop\r\nof Chichester:[238] fifth Siric, who, when he was made archbishop,\r\ngave to this his nursing-mother seven palls, with which, upon his\r\nanniversary, the whole ancient church is ornamented: sixth Elphege,\r\nwho from prior of Glastonbury was, first, made abbat of Bath, and then\r\nbishop of Winchester: seventh Ethelnoth, who upon showing to the king\r\nthe immunities of predecessors, asked, and obtained from the king’s own\r\nhand a confirmation of them, which was to the following effect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1031.] CHARTER OF GLASTONBURY.]\r\n\r\n“The Lord reigning for evermore, who disposes and governs all things by\r\nhis unspeakable power, who wonderfully determines the changes of times\r\nand of men, and justly brings them to an uncertain end, according to\r\nhis pleasure; and who from the secret mysteries of nature mercifully\r\nteaches us, how lasting, instead of fleeting and transitory, kingdoms\r\nare to be obtained by the assistance of God: wherefore I Canute king\r\nof England, and governor and ruler of the adjacent nations, by the\r\ncounsel and decree of our archbishop Ethelnoth, and of all the priests\r\nof God, and by the advice of our nobility, do, for the love of heaven,\r\nand the pardon of my sins, and the remission of the transgressions of\r\nmy brother, king Edmund, grant to the church of the holy mother of God,\r\nMary, at Glastonbury, its rights and customs throughout my kingdom, and\r\nall forfeitures throughout its possessions, and that its lands shall\r\nbe free from all claim and vexation as my own are. Moreover, I inhibit\r\nmore especially, by the authority of the Almighty Father, Son, and\r\nHoly Spirit, and the curse of the eternal Virgin, and so command it to\r\nbe observed by the judges and primates of my kingdom as they tender\r\ntheir safety, every person, be they of what order or dignity they may,\r\nfrom entering, on any account, that island;[239] but all causes,\r\necclesiastical as well as secular, shall await the sole judgment of\r\nthe abbat and convent, in like manner as my predecessors have ratified\r\nand confirmed by charters; that is to say, Kentwin, Ina, Cuthred,\r\nAlfred, Edward, Ethelred, Athelstan, the most glorious Edmund, and the\r\nequally glorious Edgar. And should any one hereafter endeavour, on any\r\noccasion, to break in upon, or make void the enactment of this grant,\r\nlet him be driven from the communion of the righteous by the fan of\r\nthe last judgment; but should any person endeavour diligently, with\r\nbenevolent intention, to perform these things, to approve, and defend\r\nthem, may God increase his portion in the land of the living, through\r\nthe intercession of the most holy mother of God, Mary, and the rest of\r\nthe saints. The grant of this immunity was written and published in the\r\nWooden Church, in the presence of king Canute, in the year of our Lord\r\n1032, the second indiction.”\r\n\r\nBy the advice of the said archbishop also, the king, sending money\r\nto foreign churches, very much enriched Chartres, where at that time\r\nflourished bishop Fulbert, most renowned for sanctity and learning.\r\nWho, among other demonstrations of his diligence, very magnificently\r\ncompleted the church of our lady St. Mary, the foundations of which he\r\nhad laid: and which moreover, in his zeal to do every thing he could\r\nfor its honour, he rendered celebrated by many musical modulations. The\r\nman who has heard his chants, breathing only celestial vows, is best\r\nable to conceive the love he manifested in honour of the Virgin. Among\r\nhis other works, a volume of epistles is extant; in one of which,[240]\r\nhe thanks that most magnificent king Canute, for pouring out the bowels\r\nof his generosity in donations to the church of Chartres.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth year of Canute’s reign, Robert king of France, of\r\nwhom we have before briefly spoken, departed this life: a man so much\r\ngiven to alms, that when, on festival days, he was either dressing, or\r\nputting off the royal robes, if he had nothing else at hand, he would\r\ngive even these to the poor, if his attendants did not purposely drive\r\naway the needy who were importuning him. He had two sons, Odo, and\r\nHenry: the elder, Odo,[241] was dull: the other crafty and impetuous.\r\nEach parent had severally divided their affections on their children:\r\nthe father loved the first-born, often saying that he should succeed\r\nhim: the mother regarded the younger, to whom the sovereignty was\r\njustly due, if not for his age, yet certainly for his ability. It\r\nhappened, as women are persevering in their designs, that she did\r\nnot cease until, by means of presents, and large promises, she had\r\ngotten to her side all the chief nobility who are subject to the power\r\nof France. In consequence, Henry, chiefly through the assistance of\r\nRobert the Norman, was crowned ere his father had well breathed his\r\nlast. Mindful of this kindness, when, as I before related, Robert went\r\nto Jerusalem, Henry most strenuously espoused the cause of William,\r\nhis son, then a youth, against those who attempted to throw off his\r\nyoke. In the meantime Canute, finishing his earthly career, died at\r\nShaftesbury, and was buried at Winchester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\n_Of king Harold and Hardecanute._ [A.D. 1036-1042.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1036.] HAROLD AND HARDECANUTE.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1041.] EXPULSION OF A BISHOP.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord’s incarnation 1036,[242] Harold, whom fame[243]\r\nreported to be the son of Canute, by the daughter of earl Elfelm,\r\nsucceeded, and reigned four years and as many months. He was elected\r\nby the Danes and the citizens of London, who, from long intercourse\r\nwith these barbarians, had almost entirely adopted their customs. The\r\nEnglish resisted for a long time, rather wishing to have one of the\r\nsons of Ethelred, who were then in Normandy, or else Hardecanute, the\r\nson of Canute by Emma, at that time in Denmark, for their king. The\r\ngreatest stickler for justice, at this juncture, was earl Godwin; who\r\nprofessing himself the defender of the fatherless, and having queen\r\nEmma and the royal treasures in his custody, for some time restrained\r\nhis opponents by the power of his name: but at last, overcome by\r\nnumbers and by violence, he was obliged to give way. Harold, secure in\r\nhis sovereignty, drove his mother-in-law into exile. Not thinking she\r\nshould be safe in Normandy, where, her brother and nephews being dead,\r\ndisgust at the rule of a deserted orphan created great disorders, she\r\npassed over into Flanders, to earl Baldwin, a man of tried integrity:\r\nwho afterwards, when king Henry died leaving a young son, Philip,\r\nfor some years nobly governed the kingdom of France, and faithfully\r\nrestored it to him, for he had married his aunt, when he came of age.\r\nEmma passed three years securely under the protection of this man,\r\nat the expiration of which, Harold dying at Oxford, in the month of\r\nApril,[244] was buried at Westminster. The Danes and the English\r\nthen uniting in one common sentiment of sending for Hardecanute, he\r\ncame, by way of Normandy, into England in the month of August. For\r\nEthelred’s sons were held in contempt nearly by all, more from the\r\nrecollection of their father’s indolence, than the power of the Danes.\r\nHardecanute, reigning two years except ten days, lost his life amid\r\nhis cups at Lambeth nigh London, and was buried near his father at\r\nWinchester: a young man who evinced great affection towards his brother\r\nand sister. For his brother, Edward, wearied with continual wandering,\r\nrevisiting his native land in the hope of fraternal kindness, was\r\nreceived by him with open arms, and entertained most affectionately.\r\nHe was rash, however, in other respects, and at the instigation of\r\nElfric, archbishop of York, and of others whom I am loath to name, he\r\nordered the dead body of Harold to be dug up, the head to be cut off,\r\nand thrown into the Thames, a pitiable spectacle to men! but it was\r\ndragged up again in a fisherman’s net, and buried in the cemetery of\r\nthe Danes at London. He imposed a rigid, and intolerable tribute upon\r\nEngland, in order that he might pay, according to his promise, twenty\r\nmarks to the soldiers of each of his vessels. While this was harshly\r\nlevied throughout the kingdom, two of the collectors, discharging\r\ntheir office rather too rigorously, were killed by the citizens of\r\nWorcester; upon which, burning and depopulating the city by means of\r\nhis commanders, and plundering the property of the citizens, he cast a\r\nblemish on his fame and diminished the love of his subjects. But here\r\nI will not pass over in silence, what tattlers report of Alfred the\r\nfirst-born of Ethelred. Doubtful what to do between Harold’s death and\r\nthe arrival of Hardecanute, he came into the kingdom, and was deprived\r\nof his eyes by the treachery of his countrymen, and chiefly of Godwin,\r\nat Gillingham: from thence being sent to the monastery of Ely, he\r\nsupported, for a little time, a wretched subsistence upon homely food;\r\nall his companions, with the exception of the tenth, being beheaded:\r\nfor by lot every tenth man was saved.[245] I have mentioned these\r\ncircumstances, because such is the report; but as the Chronicles are\r\nsilent, I do not assert them for fact. For this reason, Hardecanute,\r\nenraged against Living, bishop of Crediton, whom public opinion pointed\r\nout as author of the transaction, expelled him from his see: but,\r\nsoothed with money, he restored him within the year. Looking angrily\r\ntoo upon Godwin, he obliged him to clear himself by oath; but he, to\r\nrecover his favour entirely, added to his plighted oath a present of\r\nthe most rich and beautiful kind; it was a ship beaked with gold,\r\nhaving eighty soldiers on board, who had two bracelets on either arm,\r\neach weighing sixteen ounces of gold; on their heads were gilt helmets;\r\non their left shoulder they carried a Danish axe, with an iron spear in\r\ntheir right hand; and, not to enumerate everything, they were equipped\r\nwith such arms, as that splendour vying with terror, might conceal\r\nthe steel beneath the gold. But farther, as I had begun to relate,\r\nhis sister Gunhilda, the daughter of Canute by Emma, a young woman of\r\nexquisite beauty, who was sighed for, but not obtained, by many lovers\r\nin her father’s time, was by Hardecanute given in marriage to Henry,\r\nemperor of the Germans. The splendour of the nuptial pageant was very\r\nstriking, and is even in our times frequently sung in ballads about\r\nthe streets: where while this renowned lady was being conducted to the\r\nship, all the nobility of England were crowding around and contributing\r\nto her charges whatever was contained in the general purse, or royal\r\ntreasury. Proceeding in this manner to her husband, she cherished for\r\na long time the conjugal tie; at length being accused of adultery,\r\nshe opposed in single combat to her accuser, a man of gigantic size,\r\na young lad of her brother’s[246] establishment, whom she had brought\r\nfrom England, while her other attendants held back in cowardly\r\napprehension. When, therefore, they engaged, the impeacher, through\r\nthe miraculous interposition of God, was worsted, by being ham-strung.\r\nGunhilda, exulting at her unexpected success, renounced the marriage\r\ncontract with her husband; nor could she be induced either by threats\r\nor by endearments again to share his bed: but taking the veil of a nun,\r\nshe calmly grew old in the service of God.\r\n\r\nThis emperor possessed many and great virtues; and nearly surpassed\r\nin military skill all his predecessors: so much so, that he subdued\r\nthe Vindelici and the Leutici,[247] and the other nations bordering\r\non the Suevi, who alone, even to the present day, lust after pagan\r\nsuperstitions: for the Saracens and Turks worship God the Creator,\r\nlooking upon Mahomet not as God, but as his prophet. But the Vindelici\r\nworship fortune, and putting her idol in the most eminent situation,\r\nthey place a horn in her right hand, filled with that beverage, made\r\nof honey and water, which by a Greek term we call “hydromel.” St.\r\nJerome proves, in his eighteenth book on Isaiah, that the Egyptians\r\nand almost all the eastern nations do the same. Wherefore on the last\r\nday of November, sitting round in a circle, they all taste it; and if\r\nthey find the horn full, they applaud with loud clamours: because in\r\nthe ensuing year, plenty with her brimming horn will fulfil their\r\nwishes in everything: but if it be otherwise, they lament. Henry made\r\nthese nations in such wise tributary to him, that upon every solemnity\r\non which he wore his crown, four of their kings were obliged to carry\r\na cauldron in which flesh was boiled, upon their shoulders, to the\r\nkitchen, by means of levers passed through rings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1041.] ANECDOTES OF EMPEROR HENRY III.]\r\n\r\nFrequently, when disengaged from the turmoils of his empire, Henry\r\ngave himself up to good fellowship and merriment, and was replete with\r\nhumour; this may be sufficiently proved by two instances. He was so\r\nextremely fond of his sister, who was a nun, that he never suffered\r\nher to be from his side, and her chamber was always next his own. As\r\nhe was on a certain time, in consequence of a winter remarkable for\r\nsevere frost and snow, detained for a long while in the same place, a\r\ncertain clerk[248] about the court, became too familiar with the girl,\r\nand often passed the greatest part of the night in her chamber. And\r\nalthough he attempted to conceal his crime by numberless subterfuges,\r\nyet some one perceived it, for it is difficult not to betray guilt\r\neither by look or action, and the affair becoming notorious, the\r\nemperor was the only person in ignorance, and who still believed\r\nhis sister to be chaste. On one particular night, however, as they\r\nwere enjoying their fond embraces, and continuing their pleasures\r\nlonger than usual, the morning dawned upon them, and behold snow\r\nhad completely covered the ground. The clerk fearing that he should\r\nbe discovered by his track in the snow, persuades his mistress to\r\nextricate him from his difficulty by carrying him on her back. She,\r\nregardless of modesty so that she might escape exposure, took her\r\nparamour on her back, and carried him out of the palace. It happened at\r\nthat moment, that the emperor had risen for a necessary purpose, and\r\nlooking through the window of his chamber, beheld the clerk mounted. He\r\nwas stupified at the first sight, but observing still more narrowly,\r\nhe became mute with shame and indignation. While he was hesitating\r\nwhether he should pass over the crime unpunished, or openly reprehend\r\nthe delinquents, there happened an opportunity for him to give a vacant\r\nbishopric to the clerk, which he did: but at the same time whispered in\r\nhis ear, “Take the bishopric, but be careful you do not let women carry\r\nyou any more.” At the same time he gave his sister the rule over a\r\ncompany of nuns, “Be an abbess,” said he, “but carry clerks no longer.”\r\nBoth of them were confused, and feeling themselves grievously stricken\r\nby so grave an injunction, they desisted from a crime which they\r\nthought revealed by God.\r\n\r\nHe had also a clergyman about his palace, who abused the depth of his\r\nlearning and the melody of his voice by the vicious propensities of\r\nthe flesh, being extremely attached to a girl of bad character, in the\r\ntown; with whom having passed one festival night, he stood next morning\r\nbefore the emperor at mass, with countenance unabashed. The emperor\r\nconcealing his knowledge of the transaction, commanded him to prepare\r\nhimself to read the gospel, that he might be gratified with the melody\r\nof his voice: for he was a deacon. Conscious of his crime, he made use\r\nof a multitude of subterfuges, while the emperor, to try his constancy,\r\nstill pressed him with messages. Refusing, however, to the very last,\r\nthe emperor said, “Since you will not obey me in so easy a command, I\r\nbanish you from the whole of my territories.” The deacon, yielding to\r\nthe sentence, departed directly. Servants were sent to follow him, and\r\nin case he should persist in going, to bring him back after he had left\r\nthe city. Gathering, therefore, immediately all his effects together,\r\nand packing them up, he had already gone a considerable distance,\r\nwhen he was brought back, not without extreme violence, and placed in\r\nthe presence of Henry, who smiled and said: “You have done well, and\r\nI applaud your integrity for valuing the fear of God more than your\r\ncountry, and regarding the displeasure of heaven more than my threats.\r\nAccept, therefore, the first bishopric, which shall be vacant in my\r\nempire; only renounce your dishonourable amour.”\r\n\r\nAs nothing however is lasting in human enjoyments, I shall not pass\r\nover in silence a certain dreadful portent which happened in his time.\r\nThe monastery of Fulda, in Saxony, is celebrated for containing the\r\nbody of St. Gall, and is enriched with very ample territories. The\r\nabbat of this place furnishes the emperor with sixty thousand warriors\r\nagainst his enemies; and possesses from ancient times the privilege\r\nof sitting at his right hand on the most distinguished festivals.\r\nThis Henry we are speaking of was celebrating Pentecost at Mentz. A\r\nlittle before mass, while the seats were preparing in the church, a\r\nquarrel arose between the attendants of the abbat, and those of the\r\narchbishop, which of their masters should sit next the sovereign: one\r\nparty alleging the dignity of the prelate, the other ancient usage.\r\nWhen words made but little for peace, as the Germans and Teutonians\r\npossess untractable spirits, they came to blows. Some snatched up\r\nstaves, others threw stones, while the rest unsheathed their swords:\r\nfinally each used the weapon that his anger first supplied. Thus\r\nfuriously contending in the church, the pavement soon streamed with\r\nblood: but the bishops hastening forward, peace was restored amid\r\nthe remains of the contending parties. The church was cleansed, and\r\nmass performed with joyful sound. But now comes the wonder: when\r\nthe sequence was chanted, and the choir paused at that verse, “Thou\r\nhast made this day glorious:” a voice in the air replied aloud, “I\r\nhave made this day contentious.” All the others were motionless with\r\nhorror, but the emperor the more diligently attended to his occupation,\r\nand perceiving the satisfaction of the enemy: “You,” said he, “the\r\ninventor and also the instigator of all wickedness, have made this day\r\ncontentious and sorrowful to the proud; but we, by the grace of God,\r\nwho made it glorious, will make it gracious to the poor.” Beginning the\r\nsequence afresh, they implored the grace of the Holy Spirit by solemn\r\nlamentation. You might suppose he had come upon them, for some were\r\nsinging, others weeping, and all beating their breasts. When mass was\r\nover, assembling the poor by means of his officers, he gave them the\r\nwhole of the entertainment which had been prepared for himself and his\r\ncourtiers: the emperor placing the dishes before them, standing at a\r\ndistance according to the custom of servants, and clearing away the\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1042.] HENRY’S BENEFICENCE.]\r\n\r\nIn the time of his father, Conrad, he had received a silver pipe, such\r\nas boys in sport spirt water with, from a certain clerk, covenanting to\r\ngive him a bishopric, when he should become emperor. This, when he was\r\nof man’s estate, on his application he readily gave to him. Soon after\r\nhe was confined to his bed with severe sickness: his malady increasing,\r\nhe lay for three days insensible and speechless, while the vital breath\r\nonly palpitated in his breast: nor was there any other sign of life,\r\nthan the perception of a small degree of breathing, on applying the\r\nhand to his nostrils. The bishops being present, enjoined a fast for\r\nthree days, and entreated heaven with tears and vows, for the life of\r\nthe king. Recovering by these remedies, as it is right to think, he\r\nsent for the bishop whom he had so improperly appointed, and deposed\r\nhim by the judgment of a council: confessing, that for three whole days\r\nhe saw malignant demons blowing fire upon him through a pipe; fire so\r\nfurious that ours in comparison would be deemed a jest, and have no\r\nheat: that afterwards there came a young man half scorched, bearing a\r\ngolden cup of immense size, full of water; and that being soothed by\r\nthe sight of him, and bathed by the water, the flame was extinguished,\r\nand he recovered his health: that this young man was St. Laurence, the\r\nroof of whose church he had restored when gone to decay; and, among\r\nother presents, had honoured it with a golden chalice.\r\n\r\nHere many extraordinary things occur, which are reported of this man;\r\nfor instance, of a stag, which took him on its back, when flying from\r\nhis enemies, and carried him over an unfordable river: and some others\r\nwhich I pass by because I am unwilling to go beyond the reader’s\r\nbelief. He died when he had completed the eighteenth year of his\r\nempire, and was buried at Spires, which he re-built, and called by that\r\nname, on the site of the very ancient and ruined Nemetum: his epitaph\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n  Cæsar, as was the world once great,\r\n  Lies here, confin’d in compass straight.\r\n  Hence let each mortal learn his doom;\r\n  No glory can escape the tomb.\r\n  The flower of empire, erst so gay,\r\n  Falls with its Cæsar to decay,\r\n  And all the odours which it gave\r\n  Sink prematurely to the grave.\r\n  The laws which sapient fathers made,\r\n  A listless race had dared evade,\r\n  But thou reforming by the school\r\n  Of Rome, restor’dst the ancient rule.\r\n  Nations and regions, wide and far,\r\n  Whom none could subjugate by war,\r\n  Quell’d by thy sword’s resistless strife,\r\n  Turn’d to the arts of civil life.\r\n  What grief severe must Rome engross,\r\n  Widow’d at first by Leo’s loss,\r\n  And next by Cæsar’s mournful night,\r\n  Reft of her other shining light;\r\n  Living, what region did not dread,\r\n  What country not lament thee, dead?\r\n  So kind to nations once subdued,\r\n  So fierce to the barbarians rude,\r\n  That, those who fear’d not, must bewail,\r\n  And such as griev’d not, fears assail.\r\n  Rome, thy departed glory moan,\r\n  And weep thy luminaries gone.\r\n\r\nThis Leo, of whom the epitaph speaks, had been Roman pontiff, called to\r\nthat eminence from being Bruno bishop of Spires. He was a man of great\r\nand admirable sanctity; and the Romans celebrate many of his miracles.\r\nHe died before Henry, when he had been five years pope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\n_Of St. Edward, son of king Ethelred._ [A.D. 1042-1066.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1042, 1043.] EDWARD THE CONFESSOR.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord’s incarnation 1042, St. Edward, the son of\r\nEthelred, assumed the sovereignty, and held it not quite twenty-four\r\nyears; he was a man from the simplicity of his manners little\r\ncalculated to govern; but devoted to God, and in consequence directed\r\nby him. For while he continued to reign, there arose no popular\r\ncommotions, which were not immediately quelled; no foreign war; all was\r\ncalm and peaceable both at home and abroad; which is the more an object\r\nof wonder, because he conducted himself so mildly, that he would not\r\neven utter a word of reproach to the meanest person. For when he had\r\nonce gone out to hunt, and a countryman had overturned the standings by\r\nwhich the deer are driven into the toils, struck with noble indignation\r\nhe exclaimed, “By God and his mother, I will serve you just such a\r\nturn, if ever it come in my way.” Here was a noble mind, who forgot\r\nthat he was a king, under such circumstances, and could not think\r\nhimself allowed to injure a man even of the lowest condition. In the\r\nmeantime, the regard his subjects entertained for him was extreme,\r\nas was also the fear of foreigners; for God assisted his simplicity,\r\nthat he might be feared, for he knew not how to be angry. But however\r\nindolent or unassuming himself might be esteemed, he had nobles capable\r\nof elevating him to the highest pitch: for instance, Siward, earl of\r\nthe Northumbrians; who, at his command, engaging with Macbeth, the\r\nScottish king, deprived him both of life and of his kingdom, and placed\r\non the throne Malcolm, who was the son of the king of Cumbria:[249]\r\nagain, Leofric, of Hereford; he, with liberal regard, defended him\r\nagainst the enmity of Godwin, who trusting to the consciousness of his\r\nown merits, paid little reverence to the king. Leofric and his wife\r\nGodifa, generous in their deeds towards God, built many monasteries,\r\nas, Coventry, St. Mary’s at Stow, Wenlock, Leon, and some others; to\r\nthe rest he gave ornaments and estates; to Coventry he consigned his\r\nbody, with a very large donation of gold and silver. Harold too, of\r\nthe West Saxons, the son of Godwin; who by his abilities destroyed\r\ntwo brothers, kings of the Welsh, Rees and Griffin; and reduced all\r\nthat barbarous country to the state of a province under fealty to the\r\nking. Nevertheless, there were some things which obscured the glory of\r\nEdward’s times: the monasteries were deprived of their monks; false\r\nsentences were passed by depraved men; his mother’s property, at his\r\ncommand, was almost entirely taken from her. But the injustice of these\r\ntransactions was extenuated by his favourers in the following manner:\r\nthe ruin of the monasteries, and the iniquity of the judges, are said\r\nto have taken place without his knowledge, through the insolence of\r\nGodwin and his sons, who used to laugh at the easiness of the king:\r\nbut afterwards, on being apprised of this, he severely avenged it by\r\ntheir banishment: his mother had for a long time mocked at the needy\r\nstate of her son, nor ever assisted him; transferring her hereditary\r\nhatred of the father to the child; for she had both loved Canute more\r\nwhen living, and more commended him when dead: besides, accumulating\r\nmoney by every method, she had hoarded it, regardless of the poor,\r\nto whom she would give nothing, for fear of diminishing her heap.\r\nWherefore that which had been so unjustly gathered together, was not\r\nimproperly taken away, that it might be of service to the poor, and\r\nreplenish the king’s exchequer. Though much credit is to be attached\r\nto those who relate these circumstances, yet I find her to have been\r\na religiously-disposed woman, and to have expended her property on\r\nornaments for the church of Winchester, and probably upon others.[250]\r\nBut to return: Edward receiving the mournful intelligence of the death\r\nof Hardecanute, was lost in uncertainty what to do, or whither to\r\nbetake himself. While he was revolving many things in his mind, it\r\noccurred as the better plan to submit his situation to the opinion\r\nof Godwin. To Godwin therefore he sent messengers, requesting, that\r\nhe might in security have a conference with him. Godwin, though for\r\na long time hesitating and reflecting, at length assented, and when\r\nEdward came to him and endeavoured to fall at his feet, he raised\r\nhim up; and when relating the death of Hardecanute, and begging his\r\nassistance to effect his return to Normandy, Godwin made him the\r\ngreatest promises. He said, it was better for him to live with credit\r\nin power, than to die ingloriously in exile: that he was the son of\r\nEthelred, the grandson of Edgar: that the kingdom was his due: that\r\nhe was come to mature age, disciplined by difficulties, conversant in\r\nthe art of well-governing from his years, and knowing, from his former\r\npoverty, how to feel for the miseries of the people: if he thought\r\nfit to rely on him, there could be no obstacle; for his authority so\r\npreponderated in England, that wherever he inclined, there fortune was\r\nsure to favour: if he assisted him, none would dare to murmur; and just\r\nso was the contrary side of the question: let him then only covenant a\r\nfirm friendship with himself; undiminished honours for his sons, and a\r\nmarriage with his daughter, and he who was now shipwrecked almost of\r\nlife and hope, and imploring the assistance of another, should shortly\r\nsee himself a king.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1043.] EARL GODWIN.]\r\n\r\nThere was nothing which Edward would not promise, from the exigency of\r\nthe moment: so, pledging fidelity on both sides, he confirmed by oath\r\nevery thing which was demanded. Soon after convening an assembly at\r\nGillingham, Godwin, unfolding his reasons, caused him to be received\r\nas king, and homage was paid to him by all. He was a man of ready\r\nwit, and spoke fluently in the vernacular tongue; powerful in speech,\r\npowerful in bringing over the people to whatever he desired. Some\r\nyielded to his authority; some were influenced by presents; others\r\nadmitted the right of Edward; and the few who resisted in defiance of\r\njustice and equity, were carefully marked, and afterwards driven out of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nEdward was crowned with great pomp at Winchester, on Easter-day, and\r\nwas instructed by Eadsine,[251] the archbishop, in the sacred duties\r\nof governing. This, at the time, he treasured up with readiness in\r\nhis memory, and afterwards displayed in the holiness of his conduct.\r\nThe above-mentioned Eadsine, in the following year, falling into\r\nan incurable disease, appointed as his successor Siward, abbat of\r\nAbingdon; communicating his design only to the king and the earl, lest\r\nany improper person should aspire to so great an eminence, either by\r\nsolicitation or by purchase. Shortly after the king took Edgitha, the\r\ndaughter of Godwin, to wife; a woman whose bosom was the school of\r\nevery liberal art, though little skilled in earthly matters: on seeing\r\nher, if you were amazed at her erudition, you must absolutely languish\r\nfor the purity of her mind, and the beauty of her person. Both in her\r\nhusband’s life-time, and afterwards, she was not entirely free from\r\nsuspicion of dishonour; but when dying, in the time of king William,\r\nshe voluntarily satisfied the by-standers of her unimpaired chastity,\r\nby an oath. When she became his wife, the king acted towards her so\r\ndelicately, that he neither removed her from his bed, nor knew her\r\nafter the manner of men. I have not been able to discover, whether he\r\nacted thus from dislike to her family, which he prudently dissembled\r\nfrom the exigency of the times, or out of pure regard to chastity: yet\r\nit is most notoriously affirmed, that he never violated his purity by\r\nconnexion with any woman.\r\n\r\nBut since I have gotten thus far, I wish to admonish my reader, that\r\nthe track of my history is here but dubious, because the truth of\r\nthe facts hangs in suspense. It is to be observed, that the king had\r\nsent for several Normans, who had formerly slightly ministered to\r\nhis wants when in exile. Among these was Robert, whom, from being a\r\nmonk of Jumièges, he had appointed bishop of London, and afterwards\r\narchbishop of Canterbury. The English of our times vilify this person,\r\ntogether with the rest, as being the impeacher of Godwin and his sons;\r\nthe sower of discord; the purchaser of the archbishopric: they say\r\ntoo, that Godwin and his sons were men of liberal mind, the stedfast\r\npromoters and defenders of the government of Edward; and that it was\r\nnot to be wondered at, if they were hurt at seeing men of yesterday,\r\nand strangers, preferred to themselves: still, that they never uttered\r\neven a harsh word against the king, whom they had formerly exalted to\r\nthe throne. On the opposite hand the Normans thus defended themselves:\r\nthey allege, that both himself and his sons acted with the greatest\r\nwant of respect, as well as fidelity, to the king and his party; aiming\r\nat equal sovereignty with him; often ridiculing his simplicity; often\r\nhurling the shafts of their wit against him: that the Normans could not\r\nendure this, but endeavoured to weaken their power as much as possible;\r\nand that God manifested, at last, with what kind of purity Godwin had\r\nserved him. For, after his piratical ravages, of which we shall speak\r\nhereafter, when he had been reinstated in his original favour, and was\r\nsitting with the king at table, the conversation turning on Alfred,\r\nthe king’s brother, “I perceive,” said he, “O king, that on every\r\nrecollection of your brother, you regard me with angry countenance; but\r\nGod forbid that I should swallow this morsel, if I am conscious of any\r\nthing which might tend, either to his danger or your disadvantage.” On\r\nsaying this, he was choked with the piece he had put into his mouth,\r\nand closed his eyes in death: being dragged from under the table by\r\nHarold his son, who stood near the king, he was buried in the cathedral\r\nof Winchester.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1044-1052.] PARTIES AND FEUDS.]\r\n\r\nOn account of these feuds, as I have observed, my narrative labours\r\nunder difficulties, for I cannot precisely ascertain the truth, by\r\nreason either of the natural dislike of these nations for each other,\r\nor because the English disdainfully bear with a superior, and the\r\nNormans cannot endure an equal. In the following book, however, when\r\nthe opportunity occurs for relating the arrival of the Normans in\r\nEngland, I shall proceed to speak of their habits; at present I shall\r\nglance, with all possible truth, at the grudge of the king against\r\nGodwin and his sons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1050.] GODWIN BANISHED.]\r\n\r\nEustace,[252] earl of Boulogne, the father of Godfrey and Baldwin, who,\r\nin our times, were kings of Jerusalem, had married the king’s sister,\r\nGoda, who had borne a son, named Ralph, to her former husband, Walter\r\nof Mantes. This son, at that time earl of Hereford, was both indolent\r\nand cowardly; he had been beaten in battle by the Welsh, and left his\r\ncounty and the city, together with the bishop, to be consumed with fire\r\nby the enemy; the disgrace of which transaction was wiped off by the\r\nvalour of Harold, who arrived opportunely. Eustace, therefore, crossing\r\nthe channel, from Whitsand to Dover, went to king Edward on some\r\nunknown business. When the conference was over, and he had obtained his\r\nrequest, he was returning through Canterbury,[253] where one of his\r\nharbingers, dealing too fiercely with a citizen, and demanding quarters\r\nwith blows, rather than entreaty or remuneration, irritated him to\r\nsuch a degree, that he put him to death. Eustace, on being informed\r\nof the fact, proceeded with all his retinue to revenge the murder of\r\nhis servant, and killed the perpetrator of the crime, together with\r\neighteen others: but the citizens flying to arms, he lost twenty-one\r\nof his people, and had multitudes wounded; himself and one more with\r\ndifficulty making their escape during the confusion. Thence returning\r\nto court and procuring a secret audience, he made the most of his own\r\nstory, and excited the anger of the king against the English. Godwin,\r\nbeing summoned by messengers, arrived at the palace. When the business\r\nwas related, and the king was dwelling more particularly on the\r\ninsolence of the citizens of Canterbury, this intelligent man perceived\r\nthat sentence ought not to be pronounced, since the allegations had\r\nonly been heard on one side of the question. In consequence, though the\r\nking ordered him directly to proceed with an army into Kent, to take\r\nsignal vengeance on the people of Canterbury, still he refused: both\r\nbecause he saw with displeasure, that all foreigners were gaining fast\r\nupon the favour of the king; and because he was desirous of evincing\r\nhis regard to his countrymen. Besides, his opinion was more accordant,\r\nas it should seem, with equity, which was, that the principal people\r\nof that town should be mildly summoned to the king’s court, on account\r\nof the tumult; if they could exculpate themselves, they should depart\r\nunhurt; but if they could not, they must make atonement, either by\r\nmoney, or by corporal punishment, to the king, whose peace they had\r\nbroken, and to the earl, whom they had injured: moreover, that it\r\nappeared unjust to pass sentence on those people unheard, who had a\r\nmore especial right to protection. After this the conference broke\r\nup; Godwin paying little attention to the indignation of the king, as\r\nmerely momentary. In consequence of this, the nobility of the whole\r\nkingdom were commanded to meet at Gloucester, that the business might\r\nthere be canvassed in full assembly. Thither came those, at that time,\r\nmost renowned Northumbrian earls, Siward and Leofric, and all the\r\nnobility of England. Godwin and his sons alone, who knew that they\r\nwere suspected, not deeming it prudent to be present unarmed, halted\r\nwith a strong force at Beverstone, giving out that they had assembled\r\nan army to restrain the Welsh, who, meditating independence on the\r\nking, had fortified a town in the county of Hereford, where Sweyn,\r\none of the sons of Godwin, was at that time in command. The Welsh,\r\nhowever, who had come beforehand to the conference, had accused them of\r\na conspiracy, and rendered them odious to the whole court; so that a\r\nrumour prevailed, that the king’s army would attack them in that very\r\nplace. Godwin, hearing this, sounded the alarm to his party; told them\r\nthat they should not purposely withstand their sovereign lord; but\r\nif it came to hostilities, they should not retreat without avenging\r\nthemselves. And, if better counsels had not intervened, a dreadful\r\nscene of misery, and a worse than civil war, would have ensued. Some\r\nsmall share of tranquillity, however, being restored, it was ordered\r\nthat the council should be again assembled at London; and that Sweyn,\r\nthe son of Godwin, should appease the king’s anger by withdrawing\r\nhimself: that Godwin and Harold should come as speedily as possible to\r\nthe council, with this condition: that they should be unarmed, bring\r\nwith them only twelve men, and deliver up to the king the command of\r\nthe troops which they had throughout England. This on the other hand\r\nthey refused; observing, that they could not go to a party-meeting\r\nwithout sureties and pledges; that they would obey their lord in the\r\nsurrender of the soldiers, as well as in every thing else, except\r\nrisking their lives and reputation: should they come unarmed, the loss\r\nof life might be apprehended; if attended with few followers, it would\r\ndetract from their glory. The king had made up his mind too firmly, to\r\nlisten to the entreaties of those who interceded with him; wherefore an\r\nedict was published, that they should depart from England within five\r\ndays. Godwin and Sweyn retired to Flanders, and Harold to Ireland. His\r\nearldom was given to Elgar, the son of Leofric, a man of active habits;\r\nwho, receiving, governed it with ability, and readily restored it to\r\nhim on his return; and afterwards, on the death of Godwin, when Harold\r\nhad obtained the dukedom of his father, he boldly reclaimed it, though,\r\nby the accusation of his enemies, he was banished for a time. All\r\nthe property of the queen was seized, and herself delivered into the\r\ncustody of the king’s sister at Wherwell, lest she alone should be void\r\nof care, whilst all her relations were sighing for their country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1051.] RETURN OF GODWIN.]\r\n\r\nThe following year, the exiles, each emerging from his station,\r\nwere now cruising the British sea, infesting the coast with piracy,\r\nand carrying off rich booty from the substance of their countrymen.\r\nAgainst these, on the king’s part, more than sixty sail lay at anchor.\r\nEarls Odo and Ralph, relations of the king, were commanders of the\r\nfleet. Nor did this emergency find Edward himself inactive; since\r\nhe would pass the night on ship-board, and watch the sallies of the\r\nplunderers; diligently compensating, by the wisdom of his counsel,\r\nfor that personal service which age and infirmity denied. But when\r\nthey had approached each other, and the conflict was on the eve of\r\ncommencing, a very thick mist arose, which in a moment obscured the\r\nsight of the opponents, and repressed the pitiable audacity of men.\r\nAt last Godwin and his companions were driven, by the impetuosity of\r\nthe wind, to the port they had left; and not long after returning to\r\ntheir own country with pacific dispositions, they found the king at\r\nLondon, and were received by him on soliciting pardon. The old man,\r\nskilled in leading the minds of his audience by his reputation and his\r\neloquence, dexterously exculpated himself from every thing laid to\r\nhis charge; and in a short time prevailed so far, as to recover his\r\nhonours, undiminished, for himself and for his children; to drive all\r\nthe Normans, branded with ignominy, from England; and to get sentence\r\npassed on Robert, the archbishop, and his accomplices, for disturbing\r\nthe order of the kingdom and stimulating the royal mind against his\r\nsubjects. But he, not waiting for violent measures, had fled of his\r\nown accord while the peace was in agitation, and proceeding to Rome,\r\nand appealing to the apostolical see on his case, as he was returning\r\nthrough Jumièges, he died there, and was buried in the church of St.\r\nMary, which he chiefly had built at vast expense. While he was yet\r\nliving, Stigand, who was bishop of Winchester, forthwith invaded the\r\narchbishopric of Canterbury: a prelate of notorious ambition, who\r\nsought after honours too keenly, and who, through desire of a higher\r\ndignity, deserting the bishopric of the South Saxons, had occupied\r\nWinchester, which he held with the archbishopric. For this reason he\r\nwas never honoured with the pall by the papal see, except that one\r\nBenedict, the usurper, as it were, of the papacy, sent him one; either\r\ncorrupted by money to grant a thing of this kind, or else because bad\r\npeople are pleased to gratify others of the same description. But\r\nhe, through the zeal of the faithful, being expelled by Nicholas,\r\nwho legally assumed the papacy from being bishop of Florence, laid\r\naside the title he so little deserved. Stigand, moreover, in the\r\ntime of king William, degraded by the Roman cardinals and condemned\r\nto perpetual imprisonment, could not fill up the measure of his\r\ninsatiable avidity even in death. For on his decease, a small key was\r\ndiscovered among his secret recesses, which on being applied to the\r\nlock of a chamber-cabinet, gave evidence of papers, describing immense\r\ntreasures, and in which were noted both the quality and the quantity of\r\nthe precious metals which this greedy pilferer had hidden on all his\r\nestates: but of this hereafter: I shall now complete the history of\r\nGodwin which I had begun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1065.] GODWIN’S FAMILY.]\r\n\r\nWhen he was a young man he had Canute’s sister to wife, by whom he\r\nhad a son, who in his early youth, while proudly curveting on a horse\r\nwhich his grandfather had given him, was carried into the Thames,\r\nand perished in the stream: his mother, too, paid the penalty of her\r\ncruelty; being killed by a stroke of lightning. For it is reported,\r\nthat she was in the habit of purchasing companies of slaves in England,\r\nand sending them into Denmark; more especially girls, whose beauty and\r\nage rendered them more valuable, that she might accumulate money by\r\nthis horrid traffic. After her death, he married another wife,[254]\r\nwhose descent I have not been able to trace; by her he had Harold,\r\nSweyn, Wulnod, Tosty, Girth, and Leofwine. Harold became king for a few\r\nmonths after Edward; and being overcome by William at Hastings, there\r\nlost his life and kingdom, together with his two younger brothers.\r\nWulnod, given by his father as an hostage, was sent over to Normandy\r\nby king Edward, where he remained all that king’s time in inextricable\r\ncaptivity; and being sent back into England during William’s reign,\r\ngrew old in confinement at Salisbury: Sweyn being of an obstinate\r\ndisposition, and faithless to the king, frequently revolted from his\r\nfather, and his brother Harold, and turning pirate, tarnished the\r\nvirtues of his forefathers, by his depredations on the coast: at last\r\nstruck with remorse for the murder of Bruno,[255] a relation, or as\r\nsome say, his brother, he went to Jerusalem, and returning thence was\r\nsurprised by the Saracens, and put to death: Tosty, after the death of\r\nSiward, was preferred to the earldom of Northumbria by king Edward,\r\nand presided over that province for nearly ten years; at the end of\r\nwhich he impelled the Northumbrians to rebel, by the asperity of his\r\nmanners. For finding him unattended, they drove him from the district;\r\nnot deeming it proper to kill him, from respect to his dignity: but\r\nthey put to death his attendants both English and Danes, appropriating\r\nto their own use, his horses, his arms, and his effects. As soon as\r\nthis rumour, and the distracted state of the country reached the king,\r\nHarold set forward to avenge the outrage. The Northumbrians, though not\r\ninferior in point of numbers, yet preferring peace, excused themselves\r\nto him for the transaction; averring, that they were a people\r\nfree-born, and freely educated, and unable to put up with the cruelty\r\nof any prince; that they had been taught by their ancestors either to\r\nbe free, or to die; did the king wish them to be obedient, he should\r\nappoint Morcar, the son of Elgar, to preside over them, who would\r\nexperience how cheerfully they could obey, provided they were treated\r\nwith gentleness. On hearing this, Harold, who regarded the quiet of\r\nthe country more than the advantage of his brother, recalled his\r\narmy, and, after waiting on the king, settled the earldom on Morcar.\r\nTosty, enraged against every one, retired with his wife and children\r\nto Flanders, and continued there till the death of Edward: but this I\r\nshall delay mentioning, while I record what, as I have learned from\r\nancient men, happened in his time at Rome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1065.] CHARACTER OF GREGORY VI.]\r\n\r\nPope Gregory the Sixth,[256] first called Gratian, was a man of equal\r\npiety and strictness. He found the power of the Roman pontificate so\r\nreduced by the negligence of his predecessors, that, with the exception\r\nof a few neighbouring towns, and the offerings of the faithful, he had\r\nscarcely anything whereon to subsist. The cities and possessions at a\r\ndistance, which were the property of the church, were forcibly seized\r\nby plunderers; the public roads and highways throughout all Italy were\r\nthronged with robbers to such a degree, that no pilgrim could pass in\r\nsafety unless strongly guarded. Swarms of thieves beset every path,\r\nnor could the traveller devise any method of escaping them. Their rage\r\nwas equally bent against the poor and the rich; entreaty or resistance\r\nwere alike unavailing. The journey to Rome was discontinued by every\r\nnation, as each had much rather contribute his money to the churches in\r\nhis own country, than feed a set of plunderers with the produce of his\r\nlabours. And what was the state of that city which of old was the only\r\ndwelling-place of holiness? Why there an abandoned set of knaves and\r\nassassins thronged the very forum. If any one by stratagem eluded the\r\npeople who lay in wait upon the road, from a desire even at the peril\r\nof destruction to see the church of the apostle; yet then, encountering\r\nthese robbers, he was never able to return home without the loss either\r\nof property or of life. Even over the very bodies of the holy apostles\r\nand martyrs, even on the sacred altars were swords unsheathed, and the\r\nofferings of pilgrims, ere well laid out of their hands, were snatched\r\naway and consumed in drunkenness and fornication. By such evils was\r\nthe papacy of Gregory beset. At first he began to deal gently with his\r\nsubjects; and, as became a pontiff, rather by love than by terror; he\r\nrepressed the delinquents more by words than by blows; he entreated\r\nthe townsmen to abstain from the molestation of pilgrims, and the\r\nplunder of sacred offerings. The one, he said, was contrary to nature,\r\nthat the man who breathed the common air could not enjoy the common\r\npeace; that Christians surely ought to have liberty of proceeding\r\nwhither they pleased among Christians, since they were all of the same\r\nhousehold, all united by the tie of the same blood, redeemed by the\r\nsame price: the other, he said, was contrary to the command of God,\r\nwho had ordained, that “they who served at the altar, should live by\r\nthe altar;” moreover, that “the house of God ought to be the house of\r\nprayer, not a den of thieves,” nor an assembly of gladiators; that\r\nthey should allow the offerings to go to the use of the priests, or\r\nthe support of the poor; that he would provide for those persons whom\r\nwant had compelled to plunder, by giving them some honest employment to\r\nprocure their subsistence; that such as were instigated by avaricious\r\ndesire, should desist immediately for the love of God and the credit of\r\nthe world. He invited, by mandates and epistles, those who had invaded\r\nthe patrimony of the church, to restore what did not belong to them, or\r\nelse to prove in the Roman senate, that they held it justly; if they\r\nwould do neither, they must be told that they were no longer members\r\nof the church, since they opposed St. Peter, the head of the church,\r\nand his vicar. Perpetually haranguing to this effect, and little or\r\nnothing profiting by it, he endeavoured to cure the inveterate disorder\r\nby having recourse to harsher remedies. He then separated from the body\r\nof the church, by the brand of excommunication, all who were guilty of\r\nsuch practices, and even those who associated or conversed with the\r\ndelinquents. Though he acted strictly according to his duty, yet his\r\ndiligence in this business had well nigh proved his destruction; for\r\nas one says, “He who accuses a mocker, makes himself an enemy,” so the\r\nabandoned crew began to kick against this gentle admonition; to utter\r\ntheir threats aloud; to clash their arms around the walls of the city,\r\nso as nearly even to kill the pope. Finding it now absolutely necessary\r\nto cut short the evil, he procured arms and horses from every side,\r\nand equipped troops of horse and foot. Taking possession, in the first\r\nplace, of the church of St. Peter, he either killed or put to flight\r\nthe plunderers of the oblations. As fortune appeared to favour his\r\ndesigns, he proceeded farther; and despatching all who dared resist,\r\nrestored to their original jurisdiction all the estates and towns which\r\nhad been for a considerable time lost, In this manner, peace, which\r\nhad been long driven into banishment by the negligence of many, was\r\nrestored to the country by the exertions of an individual. Pilgrims now\r\nbegan securely to travel on the public ways, which had been deserted;\r\nthey feasted their eyes with pleasure on the ancient wonders within\r\nthe city; and, having made their offerings, they returned home with\r\nsongs of joy. In the meantime the common people of Rome, who had been\r\naccustomed to live by theft, began to call him sanguinary, and not\r\nworthy to offer sacrifice to God, since he was stained by so many\r\nmurders; and, as it generally happens that the contagion of slander\r\nspreads universally, even the cardinals themselves joined in the\r\nsentiments of the people; so that, when this holy man was confined by\r\nthe sickness which proved his death, they, after consulting among\r\nthemselves, with matchless insolence recommended him not to think of\r\nordering himself to be buried in the church of St. Peter with the rest\r\nof the popes, since he had polluted his office by being accessory\r\nto the death of so many men. Resuming spirit, however, and sternly\r\nregarding them, he addressed them in the following manner:\r\n\r\n“If you possessed either a single spark of human reason, or of the\r\nknowledge of divine truth, you would hardly have approached your\r\npontiff with so inconsiderate an address; for, throughout my whole\r\nlife, I have dissipated my own patrimony for your advantage, and at\r\nlast have sacrificed the applause of the world for your rescue. If any\r\nother persons were to allege what you urge in defamation of me, it\r\nwould become you to silence them by explaining away the false opinions\r\nof fools. For whom, I pray you, have I laid up treasure? For myself\r\nperhaps? and yet I already possessed the treasures of my predecessors,\r\nwhich were enough for any man’s covetousness. To whom have I restored\r\nsafety and liberty? You will reply, to myself perhaps? And yet I\r\nwas adored by the people, and did, without restraint, whatever I\r\npleased; entire orations teemed with my praises; every day resounded\r\nmy applause. These praises and these applauses have been lost to me,\r\nthrough my concern for your poverty. Towards you I turned my thoughts;\r\nand found that I must adopt severer measures. A sacrilegious robber\r\nfattened on the produce of your property, while your subsistence was\r\nonly from day to day. He, from the offerings belonging to you, was clad\r\nin costly silk; while you, in mean and tattered clothing, absolutely\r\ngrieved my sight. In consequence, when I could endure this no longer, I\r\nacted with hostility to others, that I might get credit for the clergy,\r\nthough at the loss of the citizens. However, I now find I have lavished\r\nmy favours on the ungrateful; for you publicly proclaim what others\r\nmutter only in secret. I approve, indeed, your freedom, but I look\r\nin vain for your affection. A dying parent is persecuted by his sons\r\nconcerning his burial. Will you deny me the house common to all living?\r\nThe harlot, the usurer, the robber, are not forbidden an entrance\r\nto the church, and do you refuse it to the pope? What signifies it\r\nwhether the dead or the living enter the sanctuary, except it be, that\r\nthe living is subject to many temptations, so that he cannot be free\r\nfrom spot even in the church; often finding matter of sin in the very\r\nplace where he had come to wash it away; whereas the dead knows not\r\nhow, nay, he who wants only his last sad office, has not the power to\r\nsin. What savage barbarity then is it to exclude from the house of God\r\nhim in whom both the inclination and the power of sinning have ceased!\r\nRepent, then, my sons, of your precipitate boldness, if perchance God\r\nmay forgive you this crime, for you have spoken both foolishly and\r\nbitterly even to this present hour. But that you may not suppose me to\r\nrest merely on my own authority, listen to reason. Every act of man\r\nought to be considered according to the intention of his heart, that\r\nthe examination of the deed may proceed to that point whence the design\r\noriginated; I am deceived if the Truth does not say the same; ‘If thine\r\neye be simple thy whole body shall be full of light; if evil, all thy\r\nbody shall be dark.’ A wretched pauper hath often come to me to relieve\r\nhis distress. As I knew not what was about to happen, I have presented\r\nhim with divers pieces of money, and dismissed him. On his departure\r\nhe has met with a thief on the public road, has incautiously fallen\r\ninto conversation with him, proclaimed the kindness of the apostolical\r\nsee, and, to prove the truth of his words, produced the purse. On\r\ntheir journey the way has been beguiled with various discourse, until\r\nthe dissembler, loitering somewhat behind, has felled the stranger\r\nwith a club, and immediately despatched him; and, after carrying off\r\nhis money, has boasted of a murder which his thirst for plunder had\r\nexcited. Can you, therefore, justly accuse me for giving that to a\r\nstranger which was the cause of his death? for even the most cruel\r\nperson would not murder a man unless he hoped to fill his pockets with\r\nthe money. What shall I say of civil and ecclesiastical laws? By these\r\nis not the self-same fact both punished and approved under different\r\ncircumstances? The thief is punished for murdering a man in secret,\r\nwhereas the soldier is applauded who destroys his enemy in battle; the\r\nhomicide, then, is ignominious in one and laudable in the other, as\r\nthe latter committed it for the safety of his country, the former for\r\nthe gratification of his desire for plunder. My predecessor Adrian the\r\nFirst, of renowned memory, was applauded for giving up the investiture\r\nof the churches to Charles the Great; so that no person elected could\r\nbe consecrated by the bishop till the king had first dignified him with\r\nthe ring and staff: on the other hand the pontiffs of our time have\r\ngot credit for taking away these appointments from the princes. What\r\nat that time, then, might reasonably be granted, may at the present\r\nbe reasonably taken away. But why so? Because the mind of Charles the\r\nGreat was not assailable by avarice, nor could any person easily find\r\naccess unless he entered by the door. Besides, at so vast a distance,\r\nit could not be required of the papal see to grant its consent to each\r\nperson elected, so long as there was a king at hand who disposed of\r\nnothing through avarice, but always appointed religious persons to\r\nthe churches, according to the sacred ordinances of the canons. At\r\nthe present time luxury and ambition have beset every king’s palace;\r\nwherefore the spouse of Christ deservedly asserts her liberty, lest\r\na tyrant should prostitute to an ambitious usurper. Thus, on either\r\nside, may my cause be denied or affirmed; it is not the office of a\r\nbishop either himself to fight, or to command others to do so; but it\r\nbelongs to a bishop’s function, if he see innocence made shipwreck of,\r\nto oppose both hand and tongue. Ezekiel accuses the priests for not\r\nstrongly opposing and holding forth a shield for the house of Israel in\r\nthe day of the Lord. Now there are two persons in the church of God,\r\nappointed for the purpose of repressing crimes; one who can rebuke\r\nsharply; the other, who can wield the sword. I, as you can witness for\r\nme, have not neglected my part; as far as I saw it could profit, I\r\ndid rebuke sharply. I sent a message to him whose business it was to\r\nbear the sword; he wrote me word back, that he was occupied in his war\r\nwith the Vandals, entreating me not to spare my labour nor his expense\r\nin breaking up the meetings of the plunderers. If I had refused,\r\nwhat excuse could I offer to God after the emperor had delegated his\r\noffice to me? Could I see the murder of the townspeople, the robbery\r\nof the pilgrims, and slumber on? But he who spares a thief, kills the\r\ninnocent. Yet it will be objected that it is not the part of a priest\r\nto defile himself with the blood of any one: I grant it. But he does\r\nnot defile himself, who frees the innocent by the destruction of the\r\nguilty. Blessed, truly blessed, are they who always keep judgment and\r\ndo justice. Phineas and Mattathias were priests most renowned in fame,\r\nboth crowned with the sacred mitre, and both habited in sacerdotal\r\ngarb; and yet they both punished the wicked with their own hands. The\r\none transfixed the guilty couple with a javelin: the other mingled the\r\nblood of the sacrificer with the sacrifice. If then those persons,\r\nregarding, as it were, the thick darkness of the law, were, through\r\ndivine zeal, transported for mysteries, the shadows only of those which\r\nwere to be; shall we, who see the truth with perfect clearness, suffer\r\nour sacred things to be profaned? Azarias the priest drove away king\r\nOzias, when offering incense, and no doubt would have killed him, had\r\nhe not quickly departed; the divine vengeance, however, anticipated\r\nthe hand of the priest, for a leprosy preyed on the body of the man\r\nwhose mind had coveted unlawful things; the devotion of a king was\r\ndisturbed, and shall not the desires of a thief be so? It is not enough\r\nto excuse, I even applaud this my conduct; indeed I have conferred a\r\nbenefit on the very persons I seem to have destroyed. I have diminished\r\ntheir punishment in accelerating their deaths. The longer a wicked man\r\nlives the more he will sin, unless he be such as God hath graciously\r\nreserved for a singular example. Death in general is good for all;\r\nfor by it the just man finds repose in heaven,--the unjust ceases\r\nfrom his crimes,--the bad man puts an end to his guilt,--the good\r\nproceeds to his reward,--the saint approaches to the palm,--the sinner\r\nlooks forward to pardon, because death has fixed a boundary to his\r\ntransgressions. They then surely ought to thank me, who through my\r\nconduct have been exempted from so many sufferings. I have urged these\r\nmatters in my own defence, and to invalidate your assertions: however,\r\nsince both your reasoning and mine may be fallacious, let us commit\r\nall to the decision of God. Place my body, when laid out in the manner\r\nof my predecessors, before the gates of the church; and let them be\r\nsecured with locks and bars. If God be willing that I should enter, you\r\nwill hail a miracle; if not, do with my dead body according to your\r\ninclination.”\r\n\r\nStruck by this address, when he had breathed his last, they carried\r\nout the remains of the departed prelate before the doors, which were\r\nstrongly fastened; and presently a whirlwind, sent by God, broke every\r\nopposing bolt, and drove the very doors, with the utmost violence,\r\nagainst the walls. The surrounding people applaud with joy, and the\r\nbody of the pontiff was interred, with all due respect, by the side of\r\nthe other popes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1065.] STORY OF THE BERKELEY WITCH.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time something similar occurred in England, not by divine\r\nmiracle, but by infernal craft; which when I shall have related,\r\nthe credit of the narrative will not be shaken, though the minds of\r\nthe hearers should be incredulous; for I have heard it from a man\r\nof such character, who swore he had seen it, that I should blush to\r\ndisbelieve. There resided at Berkeley a woman addicted to witchcraft,\r\nas it afterwards appeared, and skilled in ancient augury: she was\r\nexcessively gluttonous, perfectly lascivious, setting no bounds to\r\nher debaucheries, as she was not old, though fast declining in life.\r\nOn a certain day, as she was regaling, a jack-daw, which was a very\r\ngreat favourite, chattered a little more loudly than usual. On hearing\r\nwhich the woman’s knife fell from her hand, her countenance grew pale,\r\nand deeply groaning, “This day,” said she, “my plough has completed\r\nits last furrow; to-day I shall hear of, and suffer, some dreadful\r\ncalamity.” While yet speaking, the messenger of her misfortunes\r\narrived; and being asked, why he approached with so distressed an air?\r\n“I bring news,” said he, “from that village,” naming the place, “of\r\nthe death of your son, and of the whole family, by a sudden accident.”\r\nAt this intelligence, the woman, sorely afflicted, immediately took to\r\nher bed, and perceiving the disorder rapidly approaching the vitals,\r\nshe summoned her surviving children, a monk, and a nun, by hasty\r\nletters; and, when they arrived, with faltering voice, addressed them\r\nthus: “Formerly, my children, I constantly administered to my wretched\r\ncircumstances by demoniacal arts: I have been the sink of every vice,\r\nthe teacher of every allurement: yet, while practising these crimes, I\r\nwas accustomed to soothe my hapless soul with the hope of your piety.\r\nDespairing of myself, I rested my expectations on you; I advanced\r\nyou as my defenders against evil spirits, my safeguards against my\r\nstrongest foes. Now, since I have approached the end of my life, and\r\nshall have those eager to punish, who lured me to sin, I entreat you\r\nby your mother’s breasts, if you have any regard, any affection, at\r\nleast to endeavour to alleviate my torments; and, although you cannot\r\nrevoke the sentence already passed upon my soul, yet you may, perhaps,\r\nrescue my body, by these means: sew up my corpse in the skin of a stag;\r\nlay it on its back in a stone coffin; fasten down the lid with lead\r\nand iron; on this lay a stone, bound round with three iron chains of\r\nenormous weight; let there be psalms sung for fifty nights, and masses\r\nsaid for an equal number of days, to allay the ferocious attacks of my\r\nadversaries. If I lie thus secure for three nights, on the fourth day\r\nbury your mother in the ground; although I fear, lest the earth, which\r\nhas been so often burdened with my crimes, should refuse to receive\r\nand cherish me in her bosom.” They did their utmost to comply with her\r\ninjunctions: but alas! vain were pious tears, vows, or entreaties; so\r\ngreat was the woman’s guilt, so great the devil’s violence. For on\r\nthe first two nights, while the choir of priests was singing psalms\r\naround the body, the devils, one by one, with the utmost ease bursting\r\nopen the door of the church, though closed with an immense bolt, broke\r\nasunder the two outer chains; the middle one being more laboriously\r\nwrought, remained entire. On the third night, about cock-crow, the\r\nwhole monastery seemed to be overthrown from its very foundation, by\r\nthe clamour of the approaching enemy. One devil, more terrible in\r\nappearance than the rest, and of loftier stature, broke the gates to\r\nshivers by the violence of his attack. The priests grew motionless with\r\nfear,[257] their hair stood on end, and they became speechless. He\r\nproceeded, as it appeared, with haughty step towards the coffin, and\r\ncalling on the woman by name, commanded her to rise. She replying that\r\nshe could not on account of the chains: “You shall be loosed,” said he,\r\n“and to your cost:” and directly he broke the chain, which had mocked\r\nthe ferocity of the others, with as little exertion as though it had\r\nbeen made of flax. He also beat down the cover of the coffin with his\r\nfoot, and taking her by the hand, before them all, he dragged her out\r\nof the church. At the doors appeared a black horse, proudly neighing,\r\nwith iron hooks projecting over his whole back; on which the wretched\r\ncreature was placed, and, immediately, with the whole party, vanished\r\nfrom the eyes of the beholders; her pitiable cries, however, for\r\nassistance, were heard for nearly the space of four miles. No person\r\nwill deem this incredible, who has read St. Gregory’s Dialogues;[258]\r\nwho tells, in his fourth book, of a wicked man that had been buried\r\nin a church, and was cast out of doors again by devils. Among the\r\nFrench also, what I am about to relate is frequently mentioned. Charles\r\nMartel, a man of renowned valour, who obliged the Saracens, when they\r\nhad invaded France, to retire to Spain, was, at his death, buried in\r\nthe church of St. Denys; but as he had seized much of the property of\r\nalmost all the monasteries in France for the purpose of paying his\r\nsoldiers, he was visibly taken away from his tomb by evil spirits, and\r\nhas nowhere been seen to his day. At length this was revealed to the\r\nbishop of Orleans, and by him publicly made known.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1137.] THE PRIEST PALUMBUS.]\r\n\r\nBut to return to Rome: there was a citizen of this place, youthful,\r\nrich, and of senatorial rank, who had recently married; and, who\r\ncalling together his companions, had made a plentiful entertainment.\r\nAfter the repast, when by moderate drinking they had excited hilarity,\r\nthey went out into the field to promote digestion, either by leaping,\r\nor hurling, or some other exercise. The master of the banquet, who was\r\nleader of the game, called for a ball to play with, and in the meantime\r\nplaced the wedding ring on the outstretched finger of a brazen statue\r\nwhich stood close at hand. But when almost all the others had attacked\r\nhim alone, tired with the violence of the exercise, he left off playing\r\nfirst, and going to resume his ring, he saw the finger of the statue\r\nclenched fast in the palm. Finding, after many attempts, that he was\r\nunable either to force it off, or to break the finger, he retired in\r\nsilence; concealing the matter from his companions, lest they should\r\nlaugh at him at the moment, or deprive him of the ring when he was\r\ngone. Returning thither with some servants in the dead of night, he was\r\nsurprised to find the finger again extended, and the ring taken away.\r\nDissembling his loss, he was soothed by the blandishments of his bride.\r\nWhen the hour of rest arrived, and he had placed himself by the side\r\nof his spouse, he was conscious of something dense, and cloud-like,\r\nrolling between them, which might be felt, though not seen, and by\r\nthis means was impeded in his embraces: he heard a voice too, saying,\r\n“Embrace me, since you wedded me to-day; I am Venus, on whose finger\r\nyou put the ring; I have it, nor will I restore it.” Terrified at such\r\na prodigy, he had neither courage, nor ability to reply, and passed a\r\nsleepless night in silent reflection upon the matter. A considerable\r\nspace of time elapsed in this way: as often as he was desirous of the\r\nembraces of his wife, the same circumstance ever occurred; though\r\nin other respects, he was perfectly equal to any avocation, civil\r\nor military. At length, urged by the complaints of his consort, he\r\ndetailed the matter to her parents; who, after deliberating for a time,\r\ndisclosed it to one Palumbus, a suburban priest. This man was skilled\r\nin necromancy, could raise up magical figures, terrify devils, and\r\nimpel them to do anything he chose. Making an agreement, that he should\r\nfill his purse most plentifully, provided he succeeded in rendering\r\nthe lovers happy, he called up all the powers of his art, and gave the\r\nyoung man a letter which he had prepared; saying, “Go, at such an hour\r\nof the night, into the high road, where it divides into four several\r\nways, and stand there in silent expectation. There will pass by human\r\nfigures of either sex, of every age, rank, and condition; some on\r\nhorseback, some on foot; some with countenances dejected, others elated\r\nwith full-swollen insolence; in short, you will perceive in their\r\nlooks and gestures, every symptom both of joy and of grief: though\r\nthese should address you, enter into conversation with none of them.\r\nThis company will be followed by a person taller, and more corpulent\r\nthan the rest, sitting in a chariot; to him you will, in silence, give\r\nthe letter to read, and immediately your wish will be accomplished,\r\nprovided you act with resolution.” The young man took the road he was\r\ncommanded; and, at night, standing in the open air, experienced the\r\ntruth of the priest’s assertion by everything which he saw; there\r\nwas nothing but what was completed to a tittle. Among other passing\r\nfigures, he beheld a woman, in meretricious garb, riding on a mule; her\r\nhair, which was bound above in a golden fillet, floated unconfined on\r\nher shoulders; in her hand was a golden wand, with which she directed\r\nthe progress of her beast; she was so thinly clad, as to be almost\r\nnaked, and her gestures were wonderfully indecent. But what need of\r\nmore? At last came the chief, in appearance, who, from his chariot\r\nadorned with emeralds and pearls, fixing his eyes most sternly on the\r\nyoung man, demanded the cause of his presence. He made no reply, but\r\nstretching out his hand, gave him the letter. The demon, not daring to\r\ndespise the well-known seal, read the epistle, and immediately, lifting\r\nup his hands to heaven, “Almighty God,” said he, “in whose sight every\r\ntransgression is as a noisome smell, how long wilt thou endure the\r\ncrimes of the priest Palumbus?” The devil then directly sent some of\r\nthose about him to take the ring by force from Venus, who restored it\r\nat last, though with great reluctance. The young man thus obtaining his\r\nobject, became possessed of his long desired pleasures without farther\r\nobstacle; but Palumbus, on hearing of the devil’s complaint to God\r\nconcerning him, understood that the close of his days was predicted. In\r\nconsequence, making a pitiable atonement by voluntarily cutting off all\r\nhis limbs, he confessed unheard-of crimes to the pope in the presence\r\nof the Roman people.\r\n\r\nAt that time the body of Pallas, the son of Evander, of whom Virgil\r\nspeaks, was found entire at Rome, to the great astonishment of all, for\r\nhaving escaped corruption so many ages. Such, however, is the nature of\r\nbodies embalmed, that, when the flesh decays, the skin preserves the\r\nnerves, and the nerves the bones. The gash which Turnus had made in the\r\nmiddle of his breast measured four feet and a half. His epitaph was\r\nfound to this effect,\r\n\r\n  Pallas, Evander’s son, lies buried here\r\n  In order due, transfix’d by Turnus’ spear.\r\n\r\nWhich epitaph I should not think made at the time, though Carmentis the\r\nmother of Evander is reported to have discovered the Roman letters, but\r\nthat it was composed by Ennius, or some other ancient poet.[259] There\r\nwas a burning lamp at his head, constructed by magical art; so that no\r\nviolent blast, no dripping of water could extinguish it. While many\r\nwere lost in admiration at this, one person, as there are always some\r\npeople expert in mischief, made an aperture beneath the flame with an\r\niron style, which introducing the air, the light vanished. The body,\r\nwhen set up against the wall, surpassed it in height, but some days\r\nafterwards, being drenched with the drip of the eves, it acknowledged\r\nthe corruption common to mortals; the skin and the nerves dissolving.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1065.] PRODIGY NEAR NORMANDY.]\r\n\r\nAt that time too, on the confines of Brittany and Normandy, a prodigy\r\nwas seen in one, or more properly speaking, in two women: there were\r\ntwo heads, four arms, and every other part two-fold to the navel;\r\nbeneath, were two legs, two feet, and all other parts single. While\r\none was laughing, eating, or speaking, the other would cry, fast, or\r\nremain silent: though both mouths ate, yet the excrement was discharged\r\nby only one passage. At last, one dying, the other survived, and the\r\nliving carried about the dead, for the space of three years, till she\r\ndied also, through the fatigue of the weight, and the stench of the\r\ndead carcass.[260] Many were of opinion, and some even have written,\r\nthat these women represented England and Normandy, which, though\r\nseparated by position, are yet united under one master. Whatever wealth\r\nthese countries greedily absorb, flows into one common receptacle,\r\nwhich is either the covetousness of princes, or the ferocity of\r\nsurrounding nations. England, yet vigorous, supports with her wealth\r\nNormandy now dead and almost decayed, until she herself perhaps shall\r\nfall through the violence of spoilers. Happy, if she shall ever again\r\nbreathe that liberty, the mere shadow of which she has long pursued!\r\nShe now mourns, borne down with calamity, and oppressed with exactions;\r\nthe causes of which misery I shall relate, after I have despatched some\r\nthings pertaining to my subject. For since I have hitherto recorded\r\nthe civil and military transactions of the kings of England, I may be\r\nallowed to expatiate somewhat on the sanctity of certain of them; and\r\nat the same time to contemplate what splendour of divine love beamed\r\non this people, from the first dawning of their faith: since I believe\r\nyou can no where find the bodies of so many saints entire after death,\r\ntypifying the state of final incorruption. I imagine this to have\r\ntaken place by God’s agency, in order that a nation, situated, as it\r\nwere, almost out of the world, should more confidently embrace the\r\nhope of a resurrection from the contemplation of the incorruption of\r\nthe saints. There are, altogether, five which I have known of, though\r\nthe residents in many places boast of more; Saint Etheldrida,[261] and\r\nWerburga, virgins; king Edmund; archbishop Elphege;[262] Cuthbert the\r\nancient father: who with skin and flesh unwasted, and their joints\r\nflexile, appear to have a certain vital warmth about them, and to be\r\nmerely sleeping. Who can enumerate all the other saints, of different\r\nranks and professions? whose names and lives, singly to describe, I\r\nhave neither intention nor leisure: yet oh that I might hereafter have\r\nleisure! But I will be silent, lest I should seem to promise more than\r\nI can perform. In consequence, it is not necessary to mention any of\r\nthe commonalty, but merely, not to go out of the path of my subject\r\nhistory, the male and female scions of the royal stock, most of them\r\ninnocently murdered; and who have been consecrated martyrs, not by\r\nhuman conjecture, but by divine acknowledgment. Hence may be known how\r\nlittle indulgence they gave to the lust of pleasure, who inherited\r\neternal glory by means of so easy a death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1035.] OSWALD, KING AND MARTYR.]\r\n\r\nIn the former book, my history dwelt for some time on the praises of\r\nthe most holy Oswald, king and martyr; among whose other marks of\r\nsanctity, was this, which, according to some copies, is related in the\r\nHistory of the Angles.[263] In the monastery at Selsey, which Wilfrid\r\nof holy memory had filled with Northumbrian monks, a dreadful malady\r\nbroke out, and destroyed numbers; the remainder endeavoured to avert\r\nthe pestilence by a fast of three days. On the second day of the fast,\r\nthe blessed apostles Peter and Paul, appearing to a youth who was sick\r\nwith the disorder, animated him by observing: “That he should not fear\r\napproaching death, as it would be a termination of his present illness,\r\nand an entrance into eternal life; that no other person of that\r\nmonastery would die of this disorder, because God had granted this to\r\nthe merits of the noble king Oswald, who was that very day supplicating\r\nfor his countrymen: for it was on this day that the king, murdered by\r\nthe faithless, had in a moment ascended to the heavenly tribunal: that\r\nthey should search, therefore, in the scroll, in which the names of\r\nthe dead were written, and if they found it so, they should put an end\r\nto the fast, give loose to security and joy, and sing solemn masses\r\nto God, and to the holy king.” This vision being quickly followed by\r\nthe death of the boy, and the anniversary of the martyr being found in\r\nthe martyrology, and at the same time the cessation of the disorder\r\nbeing attested by the whole province, the name of Oswald was from that\r\nperiod inserted among the martyrs, which before, on account of his\r\nrecent death, had only been admitted into the list of the faithful.\r\nDeservedly, I say, then, deservedly is he to be celebrated, whose glory\r\nthe divine approbation so signally manifested, as to order him to be\r\ndignified with masses, in a manner, as I think, not usual among men.\r\nThe undoubted veracity of the historian precludes the possibility of\r\nsupposing this matter to be false; as does also the blessed bishop\r\nAcca,[264] who was the friend of the author.\r\n\r\nEgbert, king of Kent, the son of Erconbert, whom I have mentioned\r\nbefore, had some very near relations, descended from the royal line;\r\ntheir names were Ethelred[265] and Ethelbert, the sons of Ermenred his\r\nuncle. Apprehensive that they might grow up with notions of succeeding\r\nto the kingdom, and fearful for his safety, he kept them about him for\r\nsome time, with very homely entertainment: and, at last, grudging them\r\nhis regards, he removed them from his court. Soon after, when they had\r\nbeen secretly despatched by one of his servants named Thunre, which\r\nsignifies Thunder, he buried them under heaps of rubbish, thinking\r\nthat a murder perpetrated in privacy would escape detection. The eye\r\nof God however, which no secrets of the heart can deceive, brought\r\nthe innocents to light, vouchsafing many cures upon the spot; until\r\nthe neighbours, being roused, dug up the unsightly heaps of turf\r\nand rubbish cast upon their bodies, and forming a trench after the\r\nmanner of a sepulchre, they erected a small church over it. There they\r\nremained till the time of king Edgar, when they were taken up by St.\r\nOswald, archbishop[266] of Worcester, and conveyed to the monastery of\r\nRamsey; from which period, granting the petitions of the suppliant,\r\nthey have manifested themselves by many miracles.\r\n\r\nOffa king of the Mercians murdered many persons of consequence for\r\nthe security, as he supposed, of his kingdom, without any distinction\r\nof friend or foe; among these was king Ethelbert;[267] thereby being\r\nguilty of an atrocious outrage against the suitor of his daughter.\r\nHis unmerited death, however, is thought to have been amply avenged\r\nby the short reign of Offa’s son. Indeed God signalised his sanctity\r\nby such evident tokens, that at this very day the episcopal church of\r\nHereford is consecrated to his name. Nor should any thing appear idle\r\nor irrelevant, which our pious and religious ancestors have either\r\ntolerated by their silence, or confirmed by their authority.\r\n\r\nWhat shall my pen here trace worthy of St. Kenelm, a youth of tender\r\nage? Kenulf, king of the Mercians, his father, had consigned him, when\r\nseven years old, to his sister Quendrida, for the purpose of education.\r\nBut she, falsely entertaining hopes of the kingdom for herself, gave\r\nher little brother in charge to a servant of her household, with an\r\norder to despatch him. Taking out the innocent, under pretence of\r\nhunting for his amusement or recreation, he murdered and hid him in\r\na thicket. But strange to tell, the crime which had been so secretly\r\ncommitted in England, gained publicity in Rome, by God’s agency: for\r\na dove, from heaven, bore a parchment scroll to the altar of St.\r\nPeter, containing an exact account both of his death and place of\r\nburial. As this was written in the English language it was vainly\r\nattempted to be read by the Romans and men of other nations who were\r\npresent. Fortunately, however, and opportunely, an Englishman was at\r\nhand, who translated the writing to the Roman people, into Latin,\r\nand gave occasion to the pope to write a letter to the kings of\r\nEngland, acquainting them with the martyrdom of their countryman. In\r\nconsequence of this the body of the innocent was taken up in presence\r\nof a numerous assembly, and removed to Winchcomb. The murderous woman\r\nwas so indignant at the vocal chaunt of the priests and loud applause\r\nof the laity, that she thrust out her head from the window of the\r\nchamber where she was standing, and, by chance, having in her hands a\r\npsalter, she came in course of reading to the psalm “O God my praise,”\r\nwhich, for I know not what charm, reading backwards, she endeavoured\r\nto drown the joy of the choristers. At that moment, her eyes, torn\r\nby divine vengeance from their hollow sockets, scattered blood upon\r\nthe verse which runs, “This is the work of them who defame me to the\r\nLord, and who speak evil against my soul.” The marks of her blood are\r\nstill extant, proving the cruelty of the woman, and the vengeance\r\nof God. The body of the little saint is very generally adored, and\r\nthere is hardly any place in England more venerated, or where greater\r\nnumbers of persons attend at the festival; and this arising from the\r\nlong-continued belief of his sanctity, and the constant exhibition of\r\nmiracles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1065.] SAINT WISTAN.]\r\n\r\nNor shall my history be wanting in thy praise, Wistan,[268] blessed\r\nyouth, son of Wimund, son of Withlaf king of the Mercians, and of\r\nElfleda, daughter of Ceolwulf, who was the uncle of Kenelm; I will\r\nnot, I say, pass thee over in silence, whom Berfert thy relation so\r\natrociously murdered. And let posterity know, if they deem this history\r\nworthy of perusal, that there was nothing earthly more praiseworthy\r\nthan your disposition; at which a deadly assassin becoming irritated,\r\ndespatched you: nor was there any thing more innocent than your purity\r\ntowards God; invited by which, the secret Judge deemed it fitting to\r\nhonour you: for a pillar of light, sent down from heaven, piercing the\r\nsable robe of night, revealed the wickedness of the deep cavern, and\r\nbrought to view the crime of the murderer. In consequence, Wistan’s\r\nvenerable remains were taken up, and by the care of his relations\r\nconveyed to Rependun;[269] at that time a famous monastery, now a villa\r\nbelonging to the earl of Chester, and its glory grown obsolete with\r\nage; but at present thou dwellest at Evesham, kindly favouring the\r\npetitions of such as regard thee.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1065.] CHARACTER OF ST. EDMUND.]\r\n\r\nBede has related many anecdotes of the sanctity of the kings of the\r\nEast Saxons, and East Angles, whose genealogy I have in the first book\r\nof this work traced briefly; because I could no where find a complete\r\nhistory of the kings. I shall however, dilate somewhat on St. Edmund,\r\nwho held dominion in East Anglia, and to whom the time of Bede did\r\nnot extend. This province, on the south and east, is surrounded by\r\nthe ocean; on the north, by deep lakes, and stagnant pools, which,\r\nstretching out a vast distance in length, with a breadth of two or\r\nthree miles, afford abundance of fish for the use of the inhabitants;\r\non the west it is continuous with the rest of the island, but defended\r\nby the earth’s being thrown up in the form of a rampart.[270] The soil\r\nis admirable for pasture, and for hunting; it is full of monasteries,\r\nand large bodies of monks are settled on the islands of these stagnant\r\nwaters; the people are a merry, pleasant, jovial race, though apt\r\nto carry their jokes to excess. Here, then, reigned Edmund; a man\r\ndevoted to God, ennobled by his descent from ancient kings, and though\r\nhe presided over the province in peace for several years, yet never\r\nthrough the effeminacy of the times did he relax his virtue. Hingwar\r\nand Hubba, two leaders of the Danes, came over to depopulate the\r\nprovinces of the Northumbrians and East Angles. The former of these\r\nseized the unresisting king, who had cast away his arms and was lying\r\non the ground in prayer, and, after the infliction of tortures,[271]\r\nbeheaded him. On the death of this saintly man, the purity of his past\r\nlife was evidenced by unheard-of miracles. The Danes had cast away the\r\nhead, when severed from the body by the cruelty of the executioners,\r\nand it had been hidden in a thicket. While his subjects, who had\r\ntracked the footsteps of the enemy as they departed, were seeking it,\r\nintending to solemnize with due honour the funeral rites of their\r\nking, they were struck with the pleasing intervention of God: for the\r\nlifeless head uttered a voice, inviting all who were in search of it\r\nto approach. A wolf, a beast accustomed to prey upon dead carcasses,\r\nwas holding it in its paws, and guarding it untouched; which animal\r\nalso, after the manner of a tame creature, gently followed the bearers\r\nto the tomb, and neither did nor received any injury. The sacred body\r\nwas then, for a time, committed to the earth; turf was placed over it,\r\nand a wooden chapel, of trifling cost, erected. The negligent natives,\r\nhowever, were soon made sensible of the virtue of the martyr, which\r\nexcited their listless minds to reverence him, by the miracles which\r\nhe performed. And though perhaps the first proof of his power may\r\nappear weak and trivial, yet nevertheless I shall subjoin it. He bound,\r\nwith invisible bands, some thieves who had endeavoured to break into\r\nthe church by night: this was done in the very attempt; a pleasant\r\nspectacle enough, to see the plunder hold fast the thief, so that he\r\ncould neither desist from the enterprise, nor complete the design. In\r\nconsequence, Theodred bishop of London, who lies at St. Paul’s, removed\r\nthe lasting disgrace of so mean a structure, by building a nobler\r\nedifice over those sacred limbs, which evidenced the glory of his\r\nunspotted soul, by surprising soundness, and a kind of milky whiteness.\r\nThe head, which was formerly divided from the neck, is again united to\r\nthe rest of the body showing only the sign of martyrdom by a purple\r\nseam. One circumstance indeed surpasses human miracles, which is, that\r\nthe hair and nails of the dead man continue to grow: these, Oswen, a\r\nholy woman, used yearly to clip and cut, that they might be objects of\r\nveneration to posterity. Truly this was a holy temerity, for a woman\r\nto contemplate and handle limbs superior to the whole of this world.\r\nNot so Leofstan, a youth of bold and untamed insolence, who, with many\r\nimpertinent threats, commanded the body of the martyr to be shown to\r\nhim; for he was desirous, as he said, of settling the uncertainty of\r\nreport by the testimony of his own eyesight. He paid dearly, however,\r\nfor his audacious experiment; for he became insane, and shortly after,\r\ndied, swarming with vermin. He felt indeed that Edmund was now capable\r\nof doing, what he before used to do; that is,\r\n\r\n  “To spare the suppliant, but confound the proud,”\r\n\r\nby which means he so completely engaged the inhabitants of all Britain\r\nto him, that every person looked upon himself as particularly happy,\r\nin contributing either money or gifts to St. Edmund’s monastery:\r\neven kings themselves, who rule others, used to boast of being his\r\nservants, and sent him their royal crown; redeeming it, if they wished\r\nto use it, at a great price. The exactors of taxes also, who, in other\r\nplaces, gave loose to injustice, were there suppliant, and ceased their\r\ncavilling at St. Edmund’s boundary,[272] admonished thereto by the\r\npunishment of others who had presumed to overpass it.\r\n\r\nMy commendations shall also glance at the names of some maidens of the\r\nroyal race, though I must claim indulgence for being brief upon the\r\nsubject, not through fastidiousness, but because I am unacquainted\r\nwith their miracles. Anna king of the East Angles had three daughters,\r\nEtheldrida, Ethelberga, and Sexberga. Etheldrida, though married to two\r\nhusbands, yet by means of saintly continence, as Bede relates, without\r\nany diminution of modesty, without a single lustful inclination,\r\ntriumphantly displayed to heaven the palm of perpetual virginity.\r\nEthelberga, first a nun, and afterwards abbess, in a monastery in\r\nFrance called Brigis,[273] was celebrated for unblemished chastity;\r\nand it is well worthy of remark, that as both sisters had subdued the\r\nlusts of the flesh while living, so, when dead, their bodies remained\r\nuncorrupt, the one in England, and the other in France; insomuch, that\r\ntheir sanctity, which is abundantly resplendent, may suffice\r\n\r\n  “To cast its radiance over both the poles.”\r\n\r\nSexberga was married to Erconbert king of Kent, and, after his death,\r\ntook the veil in the same monastery where her sister Etheldrida was\r\nproclaimed a saint. She had two daughters by king Erconbert, Earcongota\r\nand Ermenhilda. Of Ercongota, such as wish for information will find\r\nit in Bede;[274] Ermenhilda married Wulfhere, king of the Mercians,\r\nand had a daughter, Werburga, a most holy virgin. Both are saints: the\r\nmother, that is to say, St. Ermenhilda, rests at Ely, where she was\r\nabbess after her mother, Sexberga; and the daughter lies at Chester, in\r\nthe monastery of that city, which Hugo earl of Chester, ejecting a few\r\ncanons who resided there in a mean and irregular manner, has recently\r\nerected. The praises and miracles of both these women, and particularly\r\nof the younger, are there extolled and held in veneration; and though\r\nthey are favourable to all petitions without delay, yet are they more\r\nespecially kind and assistant to the supplications of women and youths.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1065.] SAINTS MILDRITHA AND MILBURGA.]\r\n\r\nMerewald the brother of Wulfhere, by Ermenburga, the daughter of\r\nErmenred brother of Erconbert king of Kent, had two daughters:\r\nMildritha and Milburga. Mildritha, dedicating herself to celibacy,\r\nended her days in the Isle of Thanet in Kent, which king Egbert\r\nhad given to her mother, to atone for the murder of her brothers,\r\nEthelred and Ethelbert.[275] In after times, being transferred to St.\r\nAugustine’s monastery at Canterbury, she is there honoured by the\r\nmarked attention of the monks, and celebrated equally for her kindness\r\nand affability to all, as her name[276] implies. And although almost\r\nevery corner of that monastery is filled with the bodies of saints of\r\ngreat name and merit, any one of which would be of itself sufficient to\r\nirradiate all England, yet no one is there more revered, more loved,\r\nor more gratefully remembered; and she, turning a deaf ear to none who\r\nlove her, is present to them in the salvation of their souls.\r\n\r\nMilburga reposes at Wenlock:[277] formerly well known to the\r\nneighbouring inhabitants; but for some time after the arrival of\r\nthe Normans, through ignorance of the place of her burial, she was\r\nneglected. Lately, however, a convent of Clugniac monks being\r\nestablished there, while a new church was erecting, a certain boy\r\nrunning violently along the pavement, broke into the hollow of the\r\nvault, and discovered the body of the virgin; when a balsamic odour\r\npervading the whole church, she was taken up, and performed so many\r\nmiracles, that the people flocked thither in great multitudes. Large\r\nspreading plains could hardly contain the troops of pilgrims, while\r\nrich and poor came side by side, one common faith impelling all. Nor\r\ndid the event deceive their expectations: for no one departed, without\r\neither a perfect cure, or considerable abatement of his malady, and\r\nsome were even healed of the king’s evil, by the merits of this virgin,\r\nwhen medical assistance was unavailing.\r\n\r\nEdward the Elder, of whom I have before spoken at large, had by his\r\nwife Edgiva, several daughters. Among these was Eadburga, who, when\r\nshe was scarcely three years old, gave a singular indication of her\r\nfuture sanctity. Her father was inclined to try whether the little\r\ngirl was inclined to God, or to the world, and had placed in a chamber\r\nthe symbols of different professions; on one side a chalice, and the\r\ngospels; on the other, bracelets and necklaces. Hither the child was\r\nbrought in the arms of her indulgent attendant, and, sitting on her\r\nfather’s knee, was desired to choose which she pleased. Rejecting the\r\nearthly ornaments with stern regard, she instantly fell prostrate\r\nbefore the chalice and the gospels, and worshipped them with infant\r\nadoration. The company present exclaimed aloud, and fondly hailed\r\nthe prospect of the child’s future sanctity; her father embraced the\r\ninfant in a manner still more endearing. “Go,” said he, “whither the\r\nDivinity calls thee; follow with prosperous steps the spouse whom thou\r\nhast chosen, and truly blessed shall my wife and myself be, if we are\r\nsurpassed in holiness by our daughter.” When clothed in the garb of\r\na nun, she gained the affection of all her female companions, in the\r\ncity of Winchester, by the marked attention she paid them. Nor did the\r\ngreatness of her birth elevate her; as she esteemed it noble to stoop\r\nto the service of Christ. Her sanctity increased with her years, her\r\nhumility kept pace with her growth; so that she used secretly to steal\r\naway the socks of the several nuns at night, and, carefully washing and\r\nanointing them, lay them again upon their beds. Wherefore, though God\r\nsignalized her, while living, by many miracles, yet I more particularly\r\nbring forward this circumstance, to show that charity began all her\r\nworks, and humility completed them: and finally, many miracles in her\r\nlife-time, and since her death, confirm the devotion of her heart and\r\nthe incorruptness of her body, which the attendants at her churches at\r\nWinchester and Pershore relate to such as are unacquainted with them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1065.] ST. EDITHA’S CHASTITY.]\r\n\r\nSt. Editha, the daughter of king Edgar, ennobles, with her relics, the\r\nmonastery of Wilton, where she was buried, and cherishes that place\r\nwith her regard, where, trained from her infancy in the school of\r\nthe Lord, she gained his favour by unsullied virginity, and constant\r\nwatchings: repressing the pride of her high birth by her humility. I\r\nhave heard one circumstance of her, from persons of elder days, which\r\ngreatly staggered the opinions of men: for she led them into false\r\nconclusions from the splendour of her costly dress; being always\r\nhabited in richer garb than the sanctity of her profession seemed\r\nto require. On this account, being openly rebuked by St. Ethelwold,\r\nshe is reported to have answered with equal point and wit, that\r\nthe judgment of God was true and irrefragable, while that of man,\r\nalone, was fallible; for pride might exist even under the garb of\r\nwretchedness: wherefore, “I think,” said she, “that a mind may be as\r\npure beneath these vestments, as under your tattered furs.” The bishop\r\nwas deeply struck by this speech; admitting its truth by his silence,\r\nand blushing with pleasure that he had been chastised by the sparkling\r\nrepartee of the lady, he held his peace. St. Dunstan had observed her,\r\nat the consecration of the church of St. Denys, which she had built\r\nout of affection to that martyr, frequently stretching out her right\r\nthumb, and making the sign of the cross upon her forehead; and being\r\nextremely delighted at it, “May this finger,” he exclaimed, “never see\r\ncorruption:” and immediately, while celebrating mass, he burst into\r\nsuch a flood of tears, that he alarmed with his faltering voice an\r\nassistant standing near him; who inquiring the reason of it, “Soon,”\r\nsaid he, “shall this blooming rose wither; soon shall this beloved bird\r\ntake its flight to God, after the expiration of six weeks from this\r\ntime.” The truth of the prelate’s prophecy was very shortly fulfilled;\r\nfor on the appointed day, this noble, firmly-minded lady, expired in\r\nher prime, at the age of twenty-three years. Soon after, the same saint\r\nsaw, in a dream, St. Denys kindly taking the virgin by the hand, and\r\nstrictly enjoining, by divine command, that she should be honoured by\r\nher servants on earth, in the same manner as she was venerated by her\r\nspouse and master in heaven. Miracles multiplying at her tomb, it was\r\nordered, that her virgin body should be taken up, and exalted in a\r\nshrine; when the whole of it was found resolved into dust, except the\r\nfinger, with the abdomen and parts adjacent. In consequence of which,\r\nsome debate arising, the virgin herself appeared, in a dream, to one\r\nof those who had seen her remains, saying, “It was no wonder, if the\r\nother parts of the body had decayed, since it was customary for dead\r\nbodies to moulder to their native dust, and she, perhaps, as a girl,\r\nhad sinned with those members; but it was highly just, that the abdomen\r\nshould see no corruption which had never felt the sting of lust; as she\r\nhad been entirely free from gluttony or carnal copulation.”\r\n\r\nTruly both these virgins support their respective monasteries by their\r\nmerits; each of them being filled with large assemblies of nuns, who\r\nanswer obediently to the call of their mistresses and patronesses,\r\ninviting them to virtue. Happy the man, who becomes partaker of those\r\nvirgin orisons which the Lord Jesus favours with kind regard. For, as I\r\nhave remarked of the nuns of Shaftesbury, all virtues have long since\r\nquitted the earth, and retired to heaven; or, if any where, (but this I\r\nmust say with the permission of holy men,) are to be found only in the\r\nhearts of nuns; and surely those women are highly to be praised, who,\r\nregardless of the weakness of their sex, vie with each other in the\r\npreservation of their continence, and by such means ascend, triumphant,\r\nto heaven.\r\n\r\nI think it of importance to have been acquainted with many of the\r\nroyal family of either sex; as it may be gathered from thence that\r\nking Edward, concerning whom I was speaking before I digressed, by\r\nno means degenerated from the virtues of his ancestors. In fact he\r\nwas famed both for miracles, and for the spirit of prophecy, as I\r\nshall hereafter relate. In the exaction of taxes he was sparing, and\r\nhe abominated the insolence of collectors: in eating and drinking he\r\nwas free from the voluptuousness which his state allowed: on the\r\nmore solemn festivals, though dressed in robes interwoven with gold,\r\nwhich the queen had most splendidly embroidered, yet still he had such\r\nforbearance, as to be sufficiently majestic, without being haughty;\r\nconsidering in such matters, rather the bounty of God, than the pomp\r\nof the world. There was one earthly enjoyment in which he chiefly\r\ndelighted; which was, hunting with fleet hounds, whose opening in the\r\nwoods he used with pleasure to encourage: and again, with the pouncing\r\nof birds, whose nature it is to prey on their kindred species. In these\r\nexercises, after hearing divine service in the morning, he employed\r\nhimself whole days. In other respects he was a man by choice devoted\r\nto God, and lived the life of an angel in the administration of his\r\nkingdom. To the poor and to the stranger, more especially foreigners\r\nand men of religious orders, he was kind in invitation, munificent in\r\nhis presents, and constantly exciting the monks of his own country to\r\nimitate their holiness. He was of a becoming stature; his beard and\r\nhair milk-white; his countenance florid; fair throughout his whole\r\nperson; and his form of admirable proportion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1065.] ORIGIN OF THE ROYAL TOUCH.]\r\n\r\nThe happiness of his times had been revealed in a dream to Brithwin\r\nbishop of Wilton, who had made it public. For in the time of Canute,\r\nwhen, at Glastonbury, he was once intent on heavenly watchings, and\r\nthe thought of the near extinction of the royal race of the Angles,\r\nwhich frequently distressed him, came into his mind, sleep stole upon\r\nhim thus meditating; when behold! he was rapt on high, and saw Peter,\r\nthe chief of the apostles, consecrating Edward, who at that time was\r\nan exile in Normandy, king; his chaste life too was pointed out, and\r\nthe exact period of his reign, twenty-four years, determined; and, when\r\ninquiring about his posterity, it was answered, “The kingdom of the\r\nEnglish belongs to God; after you he will provide a king according to\r\nhis pleasure.”\r\n\r\nBut now to speak of his miracles. A young woman had married a husband\r\nof her own age, but having no issue by the union, the humours\r\ncollecting abundantly about her neck, she had contracted a sore\r\ndisorder; the glands swelling in a dreadful manner. Admonished in\r\na dream to have the part affected washed by the king, she entered\r\nthe palace, and the king himself fulfilled this labour of love, by\r\nrubbing the woman’s neck with his fingers dipped in water. Joyous\r\nhealth followed his healing hand: the lurid skin opened, so that worms\r\nflowed out with the purulent matter, and the tumour subsided. But as\r\nthe orifice of the ulcers was large and unsightly, he commanded her to\r\nbe supported at the royal expense till she should be perfectly cured.\r\nHowever, before a week was expired, a fair, new skin returned, and\r\nhid the scars so completely, that nothing of the original wound could\r\nbe discovered: and within a year becoming the mother of twins, she\r\nincreased the admiration of Edward’s holiness. Those who knew him more\r\nintimately, affirm that he often cured this complaint in Normandy:\r\nwhence appears how false is their notion, who in our times assert, that\r\nthe cure of this disease does not proceed from personal sanctity, but\r\nfrom hereditary virtue in the royal line.\r\n\r\nA certain man, blind from some unknown mischance, had persisted in\r\nasserting about the palace, that he should be cured, if he could touch\r\nhis eyes with the water in which the king’s hands had been washed. This\r\nwas frequently related to Edward, who derided it, and looked angrily\r\non the persons who mentioned it; confessing himself a sinner, and that\r\nthe works of holy men did not belong to him. But the servants, thinking\r\nthis a matter not to be neglected, tried the experiment when he was\r\nignorant of it, and was praying in church. The instant the blind man\r\nwas washed with the water, the long-enduring darkness fled from his\r\neyes, and they were filled with joyful light; and the king, inquiring\r\nthe cause of the grateful clamour of the by-standers, was informed of\r\nthe fact. Presently afterwards, when, by thrusting his fingers towards\r\nthe eyes of the man he had cured, and perceiving him draw back his\r\nhead to avoid them, he had made proof of his sight, he, with uplifted\r\nhands, returned thanks to God. In the same way he cured a blind man at\r\nLincoln, who survived him many years, a proof of the royal miracle.\r\n\r\nThat you may know the perfect virtue of this prince, in the power of\r\nhealing more especially, I shall add something which will excite your\r\nwonder. Wulwin, surnamed Spillecorn, the son of Wulmar of Nutgareshale,\r\nwas one day cutting timber in the wood of Bruelle, and indulging in a\r\nlong sleep after his labour, he lost his sight for seventeen years,\r\nfrom the blood, as I imagine, stagnating about his eyes: at the end of\r\nthis time, he was admonished in a dream to go round to eighty-seven\r\nchurches, and earnestly entreat a cure of his blindness from the\r\nsaints. At last he came to the king’s court, where he remained for a\r\nlong time, in vain, in opposition to the attendants, at the vestibule\r\nof his chamber. He still continued importunate, however, without being\r\ndeterred, till at last, after much difficulty, he was admitted by order\r\nof the king. When he had heard the dream, he mildly answered, “By my\r\nlady St. Mary, I shall be truly grateful, if God, through my means,\r\nshall choose to take pity upon a wretched creature.” In consequence,\r\nthough he had no confidence in himself, with respect to miracles,\r\nyet, at the instigation of his servants, he placed his hand, dipped\r\nin water, on the blind man. In a moment the blood dripped plentifully\r\nfrom his eyes, and the man, restored to sight, exclaimed with rapture,\r\n“I see you, O king! I see you, O king!” In this recovered state, he\r\nhad charge of the royal palace at Windsor, for there the cure had been\r\nperformed, for a long time; surviving his restorer several years. On\r\nthe same day, from the same water, three blind men, and a man with\r\none eye, who were supported on the royal arms, received a cure; the\r\nservants administering the healing water with perfect confidence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1065.] KING EDWARD’S VISIONS.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1065.] POPES AND EMPERORS.]\r\n\r\nOn Easter-day, he was sitting at table at Westminster, with the crown\r\non his head, and surrounded by a crowd of nobles. While the rest were\r\ngreedily eating, and making up for the long fast of Lent by the newly\r\nprovided viands, he, with mind abstracted from earthly things, was\r\nabsorbed in the contemplation of some divine matter, when presently he\r\nexcited the attention of the guests by bursting into profuse laughter:\r\nand as none presumed to inquire into the cause of his joy, he remained\r\nsilent as before, till satiety had put an end to the banquet. After\r\nthe tables were removed, and as he was unrobing in his chamber, three\r\npersons of rank followed him; of these earl Harold was one, the second\r\nwas an abbat, and the third a bishop, who presuming on their intimacy\r\nasked the cause of his laughter, observing, that it seemed just matter\r\nof astonishment to see him, in such perfect tranquillity both of time\r\nand occupation, burst into a vulgar laugh, while all others were\r\nsilent. “I saw something wonderful,” said he, “and therefore I did\r\nnot laugh without a cause.” At this, as is the custom of mankind,\r\nthey began to inquire and search into the matter more earnestly,\r\nentreating that he would condescend to disclose it to them. After\r\nmuch reluctance, he yielded to their persevering solicitations, and\r\nrelated the following wonderful circumstance, saying, that the Seven\r\nSleepers in mount Cœlius had now lain for two hundred years on their\r\nright side, but that, at the very hour of his laughter, they turned\r\nupon their left; that they would continue to lie in this manner\r\nfor seventy-four years, which would be a dreadful omen to wretched\r\nmortals. For every thing would come to pass, in these seventy-four\r\nyears, which the Lord had foretold to his disciples concerning the\r\nend of the world; nation would rise against nation, and kingdom\r\nagainst kingdom; earthquakes would be in divers places; pestilence\r\nand famine, terrors from heaven and great signs; changes in kingdoms;\r\nwars of the gentiles against the Christians, and also victories of the\r\nChristians over the pagans. Relating these matters to his wondering\r\naudience, he descanted on the passion of these sleepers, and the make\r\nof their bodies, though totally unnoticed in history, as readily as\r\nthough he had lived in daily intercourse with them. On hearing this\r\nthe earl sent a knight; the bishop a clergyman; and the abbat a monk,\r\nto Maniches the Constantinopolitan emperor, to investigate the truth\r\nof his declaration; adding letters and presents from the king. After\r\nbeing kindly entertained, Maniches sent them to the bishop of Ephesus,\r\ngiving them at the same time what is called a holy letter, that the\r\nmartyr-relics of the Seven Sleepers should be shown to the delegates of\r\nthe king of England.[278] It fell out that the presage of king Edward\r\nwas proved by all the Greeks, who could swear they had heard from their\r\nfathers that the men were lying on their right side; but after the\r\nentrance of the English into the vault, they published the truth of\r\nthe foreign prophecy to their countrymen. Nor was it long before the\r\npredicted evils came to pass; for the Hagarens, and Arabs, and Turks,\r\nnations averse to Christ, making havoc of the Christians, overran\r\nSyria, and Lycia, and Asia Minor altogether, devastating many cities\r\ntoo of Asia Major, among which was Ephesus, and even Jerusalem itself.\r\nAt the same time, on the death of Maniches emperor of Constantinople,\r\nDiogenes, and Michaelius, and Bucinacius, and Alexius, in turn hurled\r\neach other headlong from the throne; the last of whom, continuing till\r\nour time, left for heir his son John more noted for cunning and deceit\r\nthan worth. He contrived many hurtful plots against the pilgrims on\r\ntheir sacred journey; but venerating the fidelity of the English,\r\nhe showed them every civility, and transmitted his regard for them\r\nto his son.[279] In the next seven years were three popes, Victor,\r\nStephen, Nicholas,[280] who diminished the vigour of the papacy by\r\ntheir successive deaths. Almost immediately afterwards too died Henry,\r\nthe pious emperor of the Romans, and had for successor Henry his son,\r\nwho brought many calamities on the city of Rome by his folly and his\r\nwickedness. The same year Henry, king of France, a good and active\r\nwarrior, died by poison. Soon after a comet, a star denoting, as they\r\nsay, change in kingdoms, appeared trailing its extended and fiery\r\ntrain along the sky. Wherefore a certain monk of our monastery,[281]\r\nby name Elmer, bowing down with terror at the sight of the brilliant\r\nstar, wisely exclaimed, “Thou art come! a matter of lamentation to\r\nmany a mother art thou come; I have seen thee long since; but I now\r\nbehold thee much more terrible, threatening to hurl destruction on this\r\ncountry.” He was a man of good learning for those times, of mature age,\r\nand in his early youth had hazarded an attempt of singular temerity.\r\nHe had by some contrivance fastened wings to his hands and feet, in\r\norder that, looking upon the fable as true, he might fly like Dædalus,\r\nand collecting the air on the summit of a tower, had flown for more\r\nthan the distance of a furlong; but, agitated by the violence of the\r\nwind and the current of air, as well as by the consciousness of his\r\nrash attempt, he fell and broke his legs, and was lame ever after. He\r\nused to relate as the cause of his failure, his forgetting to provide\r\nhimself a tail.\r\n\r\nAnother prophecy similar to this, Edward uttered when dying, which I\r\nshall here anticipate. When he had lain two days speechless, on the\r\nthird, sadly and deeply sighing as he awoke from his torpor, “Almighty\r\nGod,” said he, “as this shall be a real vision, or a vain illusion,\r\nwhich I have seen, grant me the power of explaining it, or not, to the\r\nby-standers.” Soon after speaking fluently, “I saw just now,” continued\r\nhe, “two monks near me, whom formerly, when a youth in Normandy, I knew\r\nboth to have lived in a most religious manner, and to have died like\r\nperfect Christians. These men, announcing themselves as the messengers\r\nof God, spake to the following effect: ‘Since the chiefs of England,\r\nthe dukes, bishops, and abbats, are not the ministers of God, but of\r\nthe devil, God, after your death, has delivered this kingdom for a year\r\nand a day, into the hand of the enemy, and devils shall wander over all\r\nthe land.’ And when I said that I would show these things to my people;\r\nand promised that they should liberate themselves by repentance, after\r\nthe old example of the Ninevites; ‘Neither of these,’ said they, ‘shall\r\ntake place; for they will not repent, nor will God have mercy on them.’\r\nWhen then, said I, may cessation from such great calamities be hoped\r\nfor? They replied, ‘Whenever a green tree shall be cut through the\r\nmiddle, and the part cut off, being carried the space of three acres\r\nfrom the trunk, shall, without any assistance, become again united to\r\nits stem, bud out with flowers, and stretch forth its fruit, as before,\r\nfrom the sap again uniting; then may a cessation of such evils be at\r\nlast expected.’”\r\n\r\nThough others were apprehensive of the truth of this prediction, yet\r\nStigand, at that time archbishop, received it with laughter; saying,\r\nthat the old man doted through disease. We, however, find the truth\r\nof the presage experimentally; for England is become the residence of\r\nforeigners, and the property of strangers: at the present time, there\r\nis no Englishman, either earl, bishop, or abbat; strangers all, they\r\nprey upon the riches and vitals of England; nor is there any hope of\r\na termination to this misery. The cause of which evil, as I have long\r\nsince promised, it is now high time that my narrative should endeavour\r\nbriefly to disclose.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1065.] DEATH OF EDWARD.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1066.] HAROLD.]\r\n\r\nKing Edward declining into years, as he had no children himself, and\r\nsaw the sons of Godwin growing in power, despatched messengers to the\r\nking of Hungary, to send over Edward, the son of his brother Edmund,\r\nwith all his family: intending, as he declared, that either he, or his\r\nsons, should succeed to the hereditary kingdom of England, and that his\r\nown want of issue should be supplied by that of his kindred. Edward\r\ncame in consequence, but died almost immediately at St. Paul’s[282]\r\nin London: he was neither valiant, nor a man of abilities. He left\r\nthree surviving children; that is to say, Edgar, who, after the death\r\nof Harold, was by some elected king; and who, after many revolutions\r\nof fortune, is now living wholly retired in the country, in extreme\r\nold age: Christina, who grew old at Romsey in the habit of a nun:\r\nMargaret, whom Malcolm king of the Scots espoused. Blessed with a\r\nnumerous offspring, her sons were Edgar, and Alexander, who reigned\r\nin Scotland after their father in due succession: for the eldest,\r\nEdward, had fallen in battle with his father; the youngest, David,\r\nnoted for his meekness and discretion, is at present king of Scotland.\r\nHer daughters were, Matilda, whom in our time king Henry has married,\r\nand Maria, whom Eustace the younger, earl of Boulogne, espoused. The\r\nking, in consequence of the death of his relation, losing his first\r\nhope of support, gave the succession of England to William earl of\r\nNormandy.[283] He was well worthy of such a gift, being a young man\r\nof superior mind, who had raised himself to the highest eminence by\r\nhis unwearied exertion: moreover, he was his nearest relation by\r\nconsanguinity, as he was the son of Robert, the son of Richard the\r\nsecond, whom we have repeatedly mentioned as the brother of Emma,\r\nEdward’s mother. Some affirm that Harold himself was sent into Normandy\r\nby the king for this purpose: others, who knew Harold’s more secret\r\nintentions, say, that being driven thither against his will, by the\r\nviolence of the wind, he imagined this device, in order to extricate\r\nhimself. This, as it appears nearest the truth, I shall relate. Harold\r\nbeing at his country-seat at Boseham,[284] went for recreation on\r\nboard a fishing boat, and, for the purpose of prolonging his sport,\r\nput out to sea; when a sudden tempest arising, he was driven with his\r\ncompanions on the coast of Ponthieu. The people of that district, as\r\nwas their native custom, immediately assembled from all quarters; and\r\nHarold’s company, unarmed and few in number, were, as it easily might\r\nbe, quickly overpowered by an armed multitude, and bound hand and\r\nfoot. Harold, craftily meditating a remedy for this mischance, sent a\r\nperson, whom he had allured by very great promises, to William, to say,\r\nthat he had been sent into Normandy by the king, for the purpose of\r\nexpressly confirming, in person, the message which had been imperfectly\r\ndelivered by people of less authority; but that he was detained in\r\nfetters by Guy earl of Ponthieu, and could not execute his embassy:\r\nthat it was the barbarous and inveterate custom of the country, that\r\nsuch as had escaped destruction at sea, should meet with perils on\r\nshore: that it well became a man of his dignity, not to let this pass\r\nunpunished: that to suffer those to be laden with chains, who appealed\r\nto his protection, detracted somewhat from his own greatness: and that\r\nif his captivity must be terminated by money, he would gladly give\r\nit to earl William, but not to the contemptible Guy. By these means,\r\nHarold was liberated at William’s command, and conducted to Normandy\r\nby Guy in person. The earl entertained him with much respect, both in\r\nbanqueting and in vesture, according to the custom of his country; and\r\nthe better to learn his disposition, and at the same time to try his\r\ncourage, took him with him in an expedition he at that time led against\r\nBrittany. There, Harold, well proved both in ability and courage, won\r\nthe heart of the Norman; and, still more to ingratiate himself, he of\r\nhis own accord, confirmed to him by oath the castle of Dover, which was\r\nunder his jurisdiction, and the kingdom of England, after the death\r\nof Edward. Wherefore, he was honoured both by having his daughter,\r\nthen a child, betrothed to him, and by the confirmation of his ample\r\npatrimony, and was received into the strictest intimacy. Not long after\r\nhis return home, the king was crowned[285] at London on Christmas-day,\r\nand being there seized with the disorder of which he was sensible he\r\nshould die, he commanded the church of Westminster to be dedicated on\r\nInnocents-day.[286] Thus, full of years and of glory, he surrendered\r\nhis pure spirit to heaven, and was buried on the day of the Epiphany,\r\nin the said church, which he, first in England, had erected after that\r\nkind of style which, now, almost all attempt to rival at enormous\r\nexpense. The race of the West Saxons, which had reigned in Britain five\r\nhundred and seventy-one years, from the time of Cerdic, and two hundred\r\nand sixty-one from Egbert, in him ceased altogether to rule. For while\r\nthe grief for the king’s death was yet fresh, Harold, on the very\r\nday of the Epiphany, seized the diadem, and extorted from the nobles\r\ntheir consent; though the English say, that it was granted him by the\r\nking: but I conceive it alleged, more through regard to Harold, than\r\nthrough sound judgment, that Edward should transfer his inheritance to\r\na man of whose power he had always been jealous. Still, not to conceal\r\nthe truth, Harold would have governed the kingdom with prudence and\r\nwith courage, in the character he had assumed, had he undertaken it\r\nlawfully. Indeed, during Edward’s lifetime, he had quelled, by his\r\nvalour, whatever wars were excited against him; wishing to signalize\r\nhimself with his countrymen, and looking forward with anxious hope\r\nto the crown. He first vanquished Griffin king of the Welsh, as I\r\nhave before related, in battle; and, afterwards, when he was again\r\nmaking formidable efforts to recover his power, deprived him of his\r\nhead; appointing as his successors, two of his own adherents, that is,\r\nthe brothers of this Griffin, Blegent and Rivallo, who had obtained\r\nhis favour by their submission. The same year Tosty arrived on the\r\nHumber, from Flanders, with a fleet of sixty ships, and infested with\r\npiratical depredations those parts which were adjacent to the mouth\r\nof the river; but being quickly driven from the province by the joint\r\nforce of the brothers, Edwin and Morcar, he set sail towards Scotland;\r\nwhere meeting with Harold Harfager king of Norway, then meditating an\r\nattack on England with three hundred ships, he put himself under his\r\ncommand. Both, then, with united forces, laid waste the country beyond\r\nthe Humber; and falling on the brothers, reposing after their recent\r\nvictory and suspecting no attack of the kind, they first routed, and\r\nthen shut them up in York. Harold, on hearing this, proceeded thither\r\nwith all his forces, and, each nation making every possible exertion, a\r\nbloody encounter followed: but the English obtained the advantage, and\r\nput the Norwegians to flight. Yet, however reluctantly posterity may\r\nbelieve it, one single Norwegian for a long time delayed the triumph\r\nof so many, and such great men. For standing on the entrance of the\r\nbridge, which is called Standford Brigge,[287] after having killed\r\nseveral of our party, he prevented the whole from passing over. Being\r\ninvited to surrender, with the assurance that a man of such courage\r\nshould experience the amplest clemency from the English, he derided\r\nthose who entreated him; and immediately, with stern countenance,\r\nreproached the set of cowards who were unable to resist an individual.\r\nNo one approaching nearer, as they thought it unadvisable to come to\r\nclose quarters with a man who had desperately rejected every means\r\nof safety, one of the king’s followers aimed an iron javelin at him\r\nfrom a distance; and transfixed him as he was boastfully flourishing\r\nabout, and too incautious from his security, so that he yielded the\r\nvictory to the English. The army immediately passing over without\r\nopposition, destroyed the dispersed and flying Norwegians. King\r\nHarfager and Tosty were slain; the king’s son, with all the ships, was\r\nkindly sent back to his own country. Harold, elated by his successful\r\nenterprise, vouchsafed no part of the spoil to his soldiers. Wherefore\r\nmany, as they found opportunity, stealing away, deserted the king, as\r\nhe was proceeding to the battle of Hastings. For with the exception\r\nof his stipendiary and mercenary soldiers, he had very few of the\r\npeople[288] with him; on which account, circumvented by a stratagem of\r\nWilliam’s, he was routed, with the army he headed, after possessing\r\nthe kingdom nine months and some days. The effect of war in this\r\naffair was trifling; it was brought about by the secret and wonderful\r\ncounsel of God: since the Angles never again, in any general battle,\r\nmade a struggle for liberty, as if the whole strength of England had\r\nfallen with Harold, who certainly might and ought to pay the penalty\r\nof his perfidy, even though it were at the hands of the most unwarlike\r\npeople. Nor in saying this, do I at all derogate from the valour of\r\nthe Normans, to whom I am strongly bound, both by my descent, and for\r\nthe privileges I enjoy. Still[289] those persons appear to me to err,\r\nwho augment the numbers of the English, and underrate their courage;\r\nwho, while they design to extol the Normans, load them with ignominy. A\r\nmighty commendation indeed! that a very warlike nation should conquer\r\na set of people who were obstructed by their multitude, and fearful\r\nthrough cowardice! On the contrary, they were few in number and brave\r\nin the extreme; and sacrificing every regard to their bodies, poured\r\nforth their spirit for their country. But, however, as these matters\r\nawait a more detailed narrative, I shall now put a period to my second\r\nbook, that I may return to my composition, and my readers to the\r\nperusal of it, with fresh ardour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1066.] BATTLE OF HASTINGS.]\r\n\r\nNormans and English, incited by different motives, have written of\r\nking William: the former have praised him to excess; extolling to the\r\nutmost both his good and his bad actions: while the latter, out of\r\nnational hatred, have laden their conqueror with undeserved reproach.\r\nFor my part, as the blood of either people flows in my veins, I shall\r\nsteer a middle course: where I am certified of his good deeds, I shall\r\nopenly proclaim them; his bad conduct I shall touch upon lightly and\r\nsparingly, though not so as to conceal it; so that neither shall\r\nmy narrative be condemned as false, nor will I brand that man with\r\nignominious censure, almost the whole of whose actions may reasonably\r\nbe excused, if not commended. Wherefore I shall willingly and carefully\r\nrelate such anecdotes of him, as may be matter of incitement to the\r\nindolent, or of example to the enterprising; useful to the present age,\r\nand pleasing to posterity. But I shall spend little time in relating\r\nsuch things as are of service to no one, and which produce disgust in\r\nthe reader, as well as ill-will to the author. There are always people,\r\nmore than sufficient, ready to detract from the actions of the noble:\r\nmy course of proceeding will be, to extenuate evil, as much as can be\r\nconsistently with truth, and not to bestow excessive commendation even\r\non good actions. For this moderation, as I imagine, all true judges\r\nwill esteem me neither timid, nor unskilful. And this rule too, my\r\nhistory will regard equally, with respect both to William and his two\r\nsons; that nothing shall be dwelt on too fondly; nothing untrue shall\r\nbe admitted. The elder of these did little worthy of praise, if we\r\nexcept the early part of his reign; gaining, throughout the whole of\r\nhis life, the favour of the military at the expense of the people. The\r\nsecond, more obsequious to his father than to his brother, possessed\r\nhis spirit, unsubdued either by prosperity or adversity: on regarding\r\nhis warlike expeditions, it is matter of doubt, whether he was more\r\ncautious or more bold; on contemplating their event, whether he was\r\nmore fortunate, or unsuccessful. There will be a time, however, when\r\nthe reader may judge for himself. I am now about to begin my third\r\nvolume; and I think I have said enough to make him attentive, and\r\ndisposed to receive instruction: his own feelings will persuade him to\r\nbe candid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of William the First._ [A.D. 1066-1087.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1066.] WILLIAM THE FIRST.]\r\n\r\nRobert, second son of Richard the Second, after he had, with great\r\nglory, held the duchy of Normandy for seven years, resolved on a\r\npilgrimage to Jerusalem. He had, at that time, a son seven years of\r\nage, born of a concubine, whose beauty he had accidentally beheld,\r\nas she was dancing, and had become so smitten with it, as to form a\r\nconnexion with her: after which, he loved her exclusively, and, for\r\nsome time, regarded her as his wife. He had by her this boy, named,\r\nafter his great-great-grandfather, William, whose future glory was\r\nportended to his mother by a dream; wherein she imagined her intestines\r\nwere stretched out, and extended over the whole of Normandy and\r\nEngland: and, at the very moment, also, when the infant burst into life\r\nand touched the ground, he filled both hands with the rushes strewed\r\nupon the floor, firmly grasping what he had taken up. This prodigy was\r\njoyfully witnessed by the women, gossipping on the occasion; and the\r\nmidwife hailed the propitious omen, declaring that the boy would be a\r\nking.\r\n\r\nEvery provision being made for the expedition to Jerusalem,[290] the\r\nchiefs were summoned to a council at Feschamp, where, at his father’s\r\ncommand, all swore fidelity to William: earl Gilbert was appointed his\r\nguardian; and the protection of the earl was assigned to Henry, king of\r\nFrance. While Robert was prosecuting his journey, the Normans, each in\r\nhis several station, united in common for the defence of their country,\r\nand regarded their infant lord with great affection. This fidelity\r\ncontinued till the report was spread of Robert’s death, upon which\r\ntheir affection changed with his fortune; and then they began severally\r\nto fortify their towns, to build castles, to carry in provisions, and\r\nto seek the earliest opportunities of revolting from the child. In\r\nthe meantime, however, doubtlessly by the special aid of God who had\r\ndestined him to the sovereignty of such an extended empire, he grew up\r\nuninjured; while Gilbert, almost alone, defended by arms what was just\r\nand right: the rest being occupied by the designs of their respective\r\nparties. But Gilbert being at this time killed by his cousin Rodulph,\r\nfire and slaughter raged on all sides. The country, formerly most\r\nflourishing, was now torn with intestine broils, and divided at the\r\npleasure of the plunderers; so that it was justly entitled to proclaim,\r\n“Woe to the land whose sovereign is a child.”[291]\r\n\r\nWilliam, however, as soon as his age permitted, receiving the badge\r\nof knighthood from the king of France, inspirited the inhabitants to\r\nhope for quiet. The sower of dissension was one Guy, a Burgundian on\r\nhis father’s side, and grandson to Richard the Second by his daughter.\r\nWilliam and Guy had been children together, and at that time were\r\nequally approaching to manhood. Mutual intercourse had produced an\r\nintimacy between them which had ripened into friendship. Moreover,\r\nthinking, as they were related, that he ought to deny him nothing,\r\nhe had given him the castles of Briony and Vernon. The Burgundian,\r\nunmindful of this, estranged himself from the earl, feigning sufficient\r\ncause of offence to colour his conduct. It would be tedious, and\r\nuseless, to relate what actions were performed on either side, what\r\ncastles were taken; for his perfidy had found abettors in Nigel,\r\nviscount of Coutances, Ralph, viscount of Bayeux, and Haimo Dentatus,\r\ngrandfather of Robert, who was the occupier of many estates in England\r\nin our time. With these persons, this most daring plunderer, allured\r\nby vain expectation of succeeding to the earldom, was devastating\r\nthe whole of Normandy. A sense of duty, however, compelled the\r\nguardian-king to succour the desperate circumstances of his ward.\r\nRemembering, therefore, the kindness of his father, and that he\r\nhad, by his influence, exalted him to the kingdom, he rushed on the\r\nrevolters at Walesdun. Many thousands of them were there slain; many\r\ndrowned in the river Orne, by its rapidity, while, being hard-pressed,\r\nthey spurred their horses to ford the current. Guy, escaping with\r\ndifficulty, betook himself to Briony; but was driven thence by William,\r\nand unable to endure this disgrace, he retired, of his own accord,\r\nto Burgundy, his native soil. Here too his unquiet spirit found no\r\nrest; for being expelled thence by his brother, William, earl of that\r\nprovince, against whom he had conceived designs, it appears not what\r\nfate befell him. Nigel and Ralph were admitted to fealty: Haimo fell in\r\nthe field of battle; after having become celebrated by his remarkable\r\ndaring for having unhorsed the king himself; in consequence of which\r\nhe was despatched by the surrounding guards, and, in admiration of his\r\nvalour, honourably buried at the king’s command. King Henry received a\r\ncompensation for this favour, when the Norman lord actively assisted\r\nhim against Geoffrey Martel at Herle-Mill, which is a fortress in\r\nthe country of Anjou. For William had now attained his manly vigour;\r\nan object of dread even to his elders, and though alone, a match for\r\nnumbers. Unattended he would rush on danger; and when unaccompanied, or\r\nwith only a few followers, dart into the thickest ranks of the enemy.\r\nBy this expedition he gained the reputation of admirable bravery,\r\nas well as the sincerest regard of the king; so that, with parental\r\naffection, he would often admonish him not to hold life in contempt by\r\nencountering danger so precipitately; a life, which was the ornament of\r\nthe French, the safeguard of the Normans, and an example to both.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1047.] GEOFFREY, EARL OF ANJOU.]\r\n\r\nAt that time Geoffrey[292] was earl of Anjou, who had boastingly\r\ntaken the surname of Martel, as he seemed, by a certain kind of good\r\nfortune, to beat down all his opponents. Finally, he had made captive,\r\nin open battle, his liege lord, the earl of Poitou; and, loading\r\nhim with chains, had compelled him to dishonourable terms of peace;\r\nnamely, that he should yield up Bourdeaux and the neighbouring cities,\r\nand pay an annual tribute for the rest. But he, as it is thought,\r\nthrough the injuries of his confinement and want of food, was, after\r\nthree days, released from eternal ignominy by a timely death. Martel\r\nthen, that his effrontery might be complete, married the stepmother\r\nof the deceased; taking his brothers under his protection until they\r\nshould be capable of governing the principality. Next entering the\r\nterritories of Theobald, earl of Blois, he laid siege to the city of\r\nTours; and while he was hastening to the succour of his subjects, made\r\nhim participate in their afflictions; for being taken, and shut up in\r\nprison, he ceded the city from himself and his heirs for ever. Who\r\nshall dare cry shame on this man’s cowardice, who, for the enjoyment of\r\na little longer life, defrauded his successors for ever of the dominion\r\nof so great a city? for although we are too apt to be severe judges of\r\nothers, yet we must know, that we should consult our own safety, if we\r\nwere ever to be placed in similar circumstances. In this manner Martel,\r\ninsolent from the accession of so much power, obtained possession of\r\nthe castle of Alençon, even from the earl of Normandy; its inhabitants\r\nbeing faithlessly disposed. Irritated at this outrage, William\r\nretaliated, and invested Danfrunt, which at that time belonged to the\r\nearl of Anjou. Geoffrey, immediately, excited by the complaints of the\r\nbesieged, hastily rushed forward with a countless force. Hearing of his\r\napproach, William sends Roger Montgomery[293] and William Fitz-Osberne\r\nto reconnoitre. They, from the activity of youth, proceeding many miles\r\nin a short time, espied Martel on horseback, and apprized him of the\r\ndauntless boldness of their lord. Martel immediately began to rage, to\r\nthreaten mightily what he would do; and said that he would come thither\r\nthe next day, and show to the world at large how much an Angevin\r\ncould excel a Norman in battle: at the same time, with unparalleled\r\ninsolence, describing the colour of his horse, and the devices on the\r\narms he meant to use. The Norman nobles, with equal vanity, relating\r\nthe same of William, return and stimulate their party to the conflict.\r\nI have described these things minutely, for the purpose of displaying\r\nthe arrogance of Martel. On this occasion, however, he manifested none\r\nof his usual magnanimity, for he retreated without coming to battle; on\r\nhearing which, the inhabitants of Alençon surrendered, covenanting for\r\npersonal safety; and, afterwards, those of Danfrunt also, listed under\r\nthe more fortunate standard.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1047.] WILLIAM OF ARCHES.]\r\n\r\nIn succeeding years William, earl of Arches, his illegitimate uncle,\r\nwho had always been faithless and fluctuating from his first entrance\r\non the duchy, rebelled against him; for, even during the siege of\r\nDanfrunt, he had unexpectedly stolen away, and had communicated to\r\nmany persons the secrets of his soul. In consequence of this, William\r\nhad committed the keeping of his castle to some men, whom he had\r\nerroneously deemed faithful; but the earl, with his usual skill in\r\ndeception, had seduced even these people to his party, by giving them\r\nmany things, and promising them more. Thus possessed of the fortress,\r\nhe declared war against his lord. William, with his customary alacrity,\r\ncontrary to the advice of his friends, laid siege to Arches, declaring\r\npublicly, that the miscreants would not dare attempt any thing, if\r\nthey came into his sight. Nor was his assertion false: for more than\r\nthree hundred soldiers, who had gone out to plunder and forage, the\r\ninstant they beheld him, though almost unattended, fled back into\r\ntheir fortifications. Being inclined to settle this business without\r\nbloodshed, he fortified a castle in front of Arches, and turned to\r\nmatters of hostile operation which required deeper attention, because\r\nhe was aware that the king of France, who had already become adverse\r\nto him from some unknown cause, was hastening to the succour of the\r\nbesieged. He here gave an instance of very laudable forbearance; for\r\nthough he certainly appeared to have the juster cause, yet he was\r\nreluctant to engage with that person, to whom he was bound both by oath\r\nand by obligation. He left some of his nobility, however, to repress\r\nthe impetuosity of the king; who, falling into an ambush laid by their\r\ncontrivance, had most deservedly to lament Isembard, earl of Ponthieu,\r\nwho was killed in his sight, and Hugh Bardulf, who was taken prisoner.\r\nNot long after, in consequence of his miscarriage, retiring to his\r\nbeloved France, the earl of Arches, wasted with hunger, and worn to a\r\nskeleton, consented to surrender, and was preserved, life and limb, an\r\nexample of clemency, and a proof of perseverance. During the interval\r\nof this siege, the people of the fortress called Moulin, becoming\r\ndisaffected, at the instigation of one Walter, went over to the king’s\r\nside. An active party of soldiers was placed there, under the command\r\nof Guy, brother of the earl of Poitou, who diligently attended for some\r\ntime to his military duties: but on hearing the report of the victory\r\nat Arches, he stole away into France, and contributed, by these means,\r\nconsiderably to the glory of the duke.\r\n\r\nKing Henry, however, did not give indulgence to inactivity; but,\r\nmuttering that his armies had been a laughing-stock to William,\r\nimmediately collected all his forces, and, dividing them into two\r\nbodies, he over-ran the whole of Normandy. He himself headed all\r\nthe military power which came from that part of Celtic Gaul which\r\nlies between the rivers Garonne and Seine; and gave his brother Odo\r\nthe command over such as came from that part of Belgic Gaul which\r\nis situated between the Rhine and the Seine. In like manner William\r\ndivided his army, with all the skill he possessed; approaching by\r\ndegrees the camp of the king, which was pitched in the country of\r\nBriony, in such a manner, as neither to come to close engagement,\r\nnor yet suffer the province to be devastated in his presence. His\r\ngenerals were Robert, earl of Aux; Hugo de Gournay, Hugo de Montfort,\r\nand William Crispin, who opposed Odo at a town called Mortemar. Nor\r\ndid he, relying on the numerous army which he commanded, at all delay\r\ncoming to action; yet making only slight resistance at the beginning,\r\nand afterwards being unable to withstand the attack of the Normans,\r\nhe retreated, and was himself the first to fly. And here, while Guy,\r\nearl of Ponthieu, was anxiously endeavouring to revenge his brother,\r\nhe was made captive, and felt, together with many others surpassing\r\nin affluence and rank, the weight of that hand which was so fatal to\r\nhis family. When William was informed of this success by messengers,\r\nhe took care that it should be proclaimed in the dead of night, near\r\nthe king’s tent. On hearing which he retired, after some days spent in\r\nNormandy, into France; and, soon after, ambassadors passing between\r\nthem, it was concluded, by treaty, that the king’s partizans should be\r\nset at liberty, and that the earl should become legally possessed of\r\nall that had been, or should hereafter be, taken from Martel.\r\n\r\nIt would be both tedious and useless, to relate their perpetual\r\ncontentions, or how William always came off conqueror. What shall we\r\nsay besides, when, magnanimously despising the custom of modern times,\r\nhe never condescended to attack him suddenly, or without acquainting\r\nhim of the day. Moreover, I pass by the circumstance of king Henry’s\r\nagain violating his friendship; his entering Normandy, and proceeding\r\nthrough the district of Hiesmes to the river Dive, boasting that the\r\nsea was the sole obstacle to his farther progress. But William now\r\nperceiving himself reduced to extremities by the king’s perfidy, at\r\nlength brandished the arms of conscious valour, and worsted the royal\r\nforces which were beyond the river--for part of them, hearing of his\r\narrival, had passed over some little time before--with such entire\r\nloss, that henceforth France had no such object of dread as that\r\nof irritating the ferocity of the Normans. The death of Henry soon\r\nfollowing, and, shortly after, that of Martel, put an end to these\r\nbroils. The dying king delegated the care of his son Philip, at that\r\ntime extremely young, to Baldwin earl of Flanders. He was a man equally\r\ncelebrated for fidelity and wisdom; in the full possession of bodily\r\nstrength, and also ennobled by a marriage with the king’s sister. His\r\ndaughter, Matilda, a woman who was a singular mirror of prudence in\r\nour time, and the perfection of virtue, had been already married to\r\nWilliam. Hence it arose, that being mediator between his ward, and his\r\nson-in-law, Baldwin restrained, by his wholesome counsels, the feuds of\r\nthe chiefs, and of the people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1058.] FULK, EARL OF ANJOU.]\r\n\r\nBut since the mention of Martel has so often presented itself, I shall\r\nbriefly trace the genealogy of the earls of Anjou,[294] as far as the\r\nknowledge of my informant reaches. Fulk the elder, presiding over that\r\ncounty for many years, until he became advanced in years, performed\r\nmany great and prudent actions. There is only one thing for which I\r\nhave heard him branded: for, having induced Herbert earl of Maine\r\nto come to Saintes, under the promise of yielding him that city, he\r\ncaused him, in the midst of their conversation, to be surrounded by\r\nhis attendants, and compelled him to submit to his own conditions:\r\nin other respects he was a man of irreproachable integrity. In his\r\nlatter days, he ceded his principality to Geoffrey his son so often\r\nmentioned. Geoffrey conducted himself with excessive barbarity to the\r\ninhabitants, and with equal haughtiness even to the person who had\r\nconferred this honour upon him: on which, being ordered by his father\r\nto lay down the government and ensigns of authority, he was arrogant\r\nenough to take up arms against him. The blood of the old man, though\r\ngrown cold and languid, yet boiled with indignation; and in the course\r\nof a few days, by adopting wiser counsels, he so brought down the proud\r\nspirit of his son, that after carrying his saddle[295] on his back for\r\nsome miles, he cast himself with his burden at his father’s feet. He,\r\nfired once more with his ancient courage, rising up and spurning the\r\nprostrate youth with his foot, exclaimed, “You are conquered at last!\r\nyou are conquered!” repeating his words several times. The suppliant\r\nhad still spirit enough to make this admirable reply, “I am conquered\r\nby you alone, because you are my father; by others I am utterly\r\ninvincible.” With this speech his irritated mind was mollified, and\r\nhaving consoled the mortification of his son by paternal affection,\r\nhe restored him to the principality, with admonitions to conduct\r\nhimself more wisely: telling him that the prosperity and tranquillity\r\nof the people were creditable to him abroad, as well as advantageous\r\nat home. In the same year the old man, having discharged all secular\r\nconcerns, made provision for his soul, by proceeding to Jerusalem;\r\nwhere compelling two servants by an oath to do whatever he commanded,\r\nhe was by them publicly dragged naked, in the sight of the Turks, to\r\nthe holy sepulchre. One of them had twisted a withe about his neck, the\r\nother with a rod scourged his bare back, whilst he cried out, “Lord,\r\nreceive the wretched Fulk, thy perfidious, thy runagate; regard my\r\nrepentant soul, O Lord Jesu Christ.” At this time he obtained not his\r\nrequest; but, peacefully returning home, he died some few years after.\r\nThe precipitate boldness of his son Geoffrey has been amply displayed\r\nin my preceding history. He dying, bequeathed to Geoffrey, his sister’s\r\nson, his inheritance, but his worldly industry he could not leave him.\r\nFor being a youth of simple manners, and more accustomed to pray in\r\nchurch, than to handle arms, he excited the contempt of the people of\r\nthat country, who knew not how to live in quiet. In consequence, the\r\nwhole district becoming exposed to plunderers, Fulk, his brother, of\r\nhis own accord, seized on the duchy. Fulk was called Rhechin, from his\r\nperpetual growling at the simplicity of his brother, whom he finally\r\ndespoiled of his dignity, and kept in continual custody. He had a wife,\r\nwho, being enticed by the desire of enjoying a higher title, deserted\r\nhim and married Philip king of France; who so desperately loved her,\r\nregardless of the adage,\r\n\r\n                “Majesty and love\r\n  But ill accord, nor share the self-same seat,”\r\n\r\nthat he patiently suffered himself to be completely governed by\r\nher, though he was at the same time desirous of ruling over every\r\nother person. Lastly, for several years, merely through regard for\r\nher, he suffered himself to be pointed at like an idiot, and to be\r\nexcommunicated from the whole Christian world. The sons of Fulk were\r\nGeoffrey and Fulk. Geoffrey obtaining the hereditary surname of\r\nMartel, ennobled it by his exertions: for he procured such peace and\r\ntranquillity in those parts, as no one ever had seen, or will see in\r\nfuture. On this account being killed by the treachery of his people,\r\nhe forfeited the credit of his consummate worth. Fulk succeeding to\r\nthe government, is yet living;[296] of whom as I shall perhaps have\r\noccasion to speak in the times of king Henry, I will now proceed to\r\nrelate what remains concerning William.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1058.] GEOFFREY MARTEL.]\r\n\r\nWhen, after much labour, he had quelled all civil dissension, he\r\nmeditated an exploit of greater fame, and determined to recover those\r\ncountries anciently attached to Normandy, though now disunited by long\r\ncustom. I allude to the counties of Maine and Brittany; of which Mans,\r\nlong since burnt by Martel and deprived of its sovereign Hugo, had\r\nlately experienced some little respite under Herbert the son of Hugo;\r\nwho, with a view to greater security against the earl of Anjou, had\r\nsubmitted, and sworn fidelity to William: besides, he had solicited\r\nhis daughter in marriage, and had been betrothed to her, though he\r\ndied by disease ere she was marriageable. He left William his heir,\r\nadjuring his subjects to admit no other; telling them, they might have,\r\nif they chose, a mild and honourable lord; but, should they not, a\r\nmost determined assertor of his right. On his decease, the inhabitants\r\nof Maine rather inclined to Walter of Mantes, who had married Hugo’s\r\nsister: but at length, being brought to their senses by many heavy\r\nlosses, they acknowledged William. This was the time, when Harold was\r\nunwillingly carried to Normandy by an unpropitious gale; whom, as is\r\nbefore mentioned, William took with him in his expedition to Brittany,\r\nto make proof of his prowess, and, at the same time, with the deeper\r\ndesign of showing to him his military equipment, that he might perceive\r\nhow far preferable was the Norman sword to the English battle-axe.\r\nAlan, at that time, earl of Brittany, flourishing in youth, and of\r\ntranscendent strength, had overcome his uncle Eudo, and performed many\r\nfamous actions; and so far from fearing William, had even voluntarily\r\nirritated him. But he, laying claim to Brittany as his hereditary\r\nterritory, because Charles had given it with his daughter, Gisla, to\r\nRollo, shortly acted in such wise, that Alan came suppliantly to him,\r\nand surrendered himself and his possessions. And since I shall have\r\nbut little to say of Brittany hereafter, I will here briefly insert an\r\nextraordinary occurrence, which happened about that time in the city of\r\nNantes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1065.] STORY OF TWO CLERKS.]\r\n\r\nThere were in that city two clerks, who though not yet of legal age,\r\nhad obtained the priesthood from the bishop of that place, more by\r\nentreaty than desert: the pitiable death of one of whom, at length\r\ntaught the survivor, how near they had before been to the brink of\r\nhell. As to the knowledge of literature, they were so instructed, that\r\nthey wanted little of perfection. From their earliest infancy, they\r\nhad in such wise vied in offices of friendship, that according to the\r\nexpression of the comic writer,[297] “To serve each other they would\r\nnot only stir hand and foot, but even risk the loss of life itself.”\r\nWherefore, one day, when they found their minds more than usually free\r\nfrom outward cares, they spoke their sentiments, in a secret place,\r\nto the following effect: “That for many years they had given their\r\nattention sometimes to literature, and sometimes to secular cares;\r\nnor had they satisfied their minds, which had been occupied rather\r\nin wrong than proper pursuits; that in the meanwhile, the bitter day\r\nwas insensibly approaching, which would burst the bond of union which\r\nwas indissoluble while life remained: wherefore they should provide\r\nin time, that the friendship which united them while living should\r\naccompany him who died first to the place of the dead.” They agreed,\r\ntherefore, that whichever should first depart, should certainly\r\nappear to the survivor, either waking or sleeping, if possible within\r\nthirty days, to inform him, that, according to the Platonic tenet,\r\ndeath does not extinguish the spirit, but sends it back again, as\r\nit were from prison, to God its author. If this did not take place,\r\nthen they must yield to the sect of the Epicureans, who hold, that\r\nthe soul, liberated from the body, vanishes into air, or mingles with\r\nthe wind. Mutually plighting their faith, they repeated this oath in\r\ntheir daily conversation. A short time elapsed, and behold a violent\r\ndeath suddenly deprived one of them of life. The other remained, and\r\nseriously revolving the promise of his friend, and constantly expecting\r\nhis presence, during thirty days, found his hopes disappointed. At\r\nthe expiration of this time, when, despairing of seeing him, he had\r\noccupied his leisure in other business, the deceased, with that pale\r\ncountenance which dying persons assume, suddenly stood before him,\r\nwhen awake, and busied on some matter. The dead first addressing the\r\nliving man, who was silent: “Do you know me?” said he; “I do,” replied\r\nthe other; “nor am I so much disturbed at your unusual presence, as I\r\nwonder at your prolonged absence.” But when he had accounted for the\r\ntardiness of his appearance; “At length,” said he, “at length, having\r\novercome every impediment, I am present; which presence, if you please,\r\nmy friend, will be advantageous to you, but to me totally unprofitable;\r\nfor I am doomed, by a sentence which has been pronounced and approved,\r\nto eternal punishment.” When the living man promised to give all his\r\nproperty to monasteries, and to the poor, and to spend days and nights\r\nin fasting and prayer, for the release of the defunct; he replied,\r\n“What I have said is fixed; for the judgments of God, by which I am\r\nplunged in the sulphureous whirlpool of hell, are without repentance.\r\nThere I shall be tossed for my crimes, as long as the pole whirls round\r\nthe stars, or ocean beats the shores. The rigour of this irreversible\r\nsentence remains for ever, devising lasting and innumerable kinds of\r\npunishment: now, therefore, let the whole world seek for availing\r\nremedies! And that you may experience some little of my numberless\r\npains, behold,” said he, stretching out his hand, dripping with a\r\ncorrupted ulcer, “one of the very smallest of them; does it appear\r\ntrifling to you?” When the other replied, that it did appear so; he\r\nbent his fingers into the palm, and threw three drops of the purulent\r\nmatter upon him; two of which touching his temples, and one his\r\nforehead, penetrated the skin and flesh, as if with a burning cautery,\r\nand made holes of the size of a nut. When his friend acknowledged the\r\nacuteness of the pain, by the cry he uttered, “This,” said the dead\r\nman, “will be a strong proof to you, as long as you live, of my pains;\r\nand, unless you neglect it, a singular token for your salvation.\r\nWherefore, while you have the power; while indignation is suspended\r\nover your head; while God’s lingering mercy waits for you; change\r\nyour habit, change your disposition; become a monk at Rennes, in the\r\nmonastery of St. Melanius.” When the living man was unwilling to agree\r\nto these words, the other, sternly glancing at him, “If you doubt,\r\nwretched man,” said he, “turn and read these letters;” and with these\r\nwords, he stretched out his hand, inscribed with black characters,\r\nin which, Satan, and all the company of infernals sent their thanks,\r\nfrom hell, to the whole ecclesiastical body; as well for denying\r\nthemselves no single pleasure, as for sending, through neglect of their\r\npreaching, so many of their subject-souls to hell, as no former age had\r\never witnessed. With these words the speaker vanished; and the hearer\r\ndistributing his whole property to the church and to the poor, went to\r\nthe monastery; admonishing all, who heard or saw him, of his sudden\r\nconversion, and extraordinary interview, so that they exclaimed, “It\r\nis the right hand of the Almighty that has done this.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1065.] NEGOTIATION OF WILLIAM I.]\r\n\r\nI feel no regret at having inserted this for the benefit of my readers:\r\nnow I shall return to William. For since I have briefly, but I hope not\r\nuselessly, gone over the transactions in which he was engaged, when\r\nonly earl of Normandy, for thirty years, the order of time now requires\r\na new series of relation; that I may, as far as my inquiries have\r\ndiscovered, detect fallacy, and declare the truth relating to his regal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWhen king Edward had yielded to fate, England, fluctuating with\r\ndoubtful favour, was uncertain to which ruler she should commit\r\nherself: to Harold, William, or Edgar: for the king had recommended him\r\nalso to the nobility, as nearest to the sovereignty in point of birth;\r\nconcealing his better judgment from the tenderness of his disposition.\r\nWherefore, as I have said above, the English were distracted in their\r\nchoice, although all of them openly wished well to Harold. He, indeed,\r\nonce dignified with the diadem, thought nothing of the covenant between\r\nhimself and William: he said, that he was absolved from his oath,\r\nbecause his daughter, to whom he had been betrothed, had died before\r\nshe was marriageable. For this man, though possessing numberless good\r\nqualities, is reported to have been careless about abstaining from\r\nperfidy, so that he could, by any device, elude the reasonings of men\r\non this matter. Moreover, supposing that the threats of William would\r\nnever be put into execution, because he was occupied in wars with\r\nneighbouring princes, he had, with his subjects, given full indulgence\r\nto security. For indeed, had he not heard that the king of Norway was\r\napproaching, he would neither have condescended to collect troops,\r\nnor to array them. William, in the meantime, began mildly to address\r\nhim by messengers; to expostulate on the broken covenant; to mingle\r\nthreats with entreaties; and to warn him, that ere a year expired, he\r\nwould claim his due by the sword, and that he would come to that place,\r\nwhere Harold supposed he had firmer footing than himself. Harold again\r\nrejoined what I have related, concerning the nuptials of his daughter,\r\nand added, that he had been precipitate on the subject of the kingdom,\r\nin having confirmed to him by oath another’s right, without the\r\nuniversal consent and edict of the general meeting, and of the people:\r\nagain, that a rash oath ought to be broken; for if the oath, or vow,\r\nwhich a maiden, under her father’s roof, made concerning her person,\r\nwithout the knowledge of her parents, was adjudged invalid; how much\r\nmore invalid must that oath be, which he had made concerning the whole\r\nkingdom, when under the king’s authority, compelled by the necessity\r\nof the time, and without the knowledge of the nation.[298] Besides it\r\nwas an unjust request, to ask him to resign a government which he had\r\nassumed by the universal kindness of his fellow subjects, and which\r\nwould neither be agreeable to the people, nor safe for the military.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1066.] PREPARATIONS FOR WAR.]\r\n\r\nIn this way, confounded either by true, or plausible, arguments, the\r\nmessengers returned without success. The earl, however, made every\r\nnecessary preparation for war during the whole of that year; retained\r\nhis own soldiers with increased pay, and invited those of others:\r\nordered his ranks and battalions in such wise, that the soldiers\r\nshould be tall and stout; that the commanders and standard-bearers,\r\nin addition to their military science, should be looked up to for\r\ntheir wisdom and age; insomuch, that each of them, whether seen in\r\nthe field or elsewhere, might be taken for a prince, rather than a\r\nleader. The bishops and abbats of those days vied so much in religion,\r\nand the nobility in princely liberality, that it is wonderful,[299]\r\nwithin a period of less than sixty[300] years, how either order should\r\nhave become so unfruitful in goodness, as to take up a confederate\r\nwar against justice: the former, through desire of ecclesiastical\r\npromotion, embracing wrong in preference to right and equity; and the\r\nlatter, casting off shame, and seeking every occasion for begging\r\nmoney as for their daily pay. But at that time the prudence of William,\r\nseconded by the providence of God, already anticipated the invasion\r\nof England; and that no rashness might stain his just cause, he sent\r\nto the pope, formerly Anselm, bishop of Lucca, who had assumed the\r\nname of Alexander, alleging the justice of the war which he meditated\r\nwith all the eloquence he was master of. Harold omitted to do this,\r\neither because he was proud by nature, or else distrusted his cause; or\r\nbecause he feared that his messengers would be obstructed by William\r\nand his partisans, who beset every port. The pope, duly examining\r\nthe pretensions of both parties, delivered a standard to William,\r\nas an auspicious presage of the kingdom: on receiving which, he\r\nsummoned an assembly of his nobles, at Lillebourne, for the purpose\r\nof ascertaining their sentiments on this attempt. And when he had\r\nconfirmed, by splendid promises, all who approved his design, he\r\nappointed them to prepare shipping, in proportion to the extent of\r\ntheir possessions. Thus they departed at that time; and, in the month\r\nof August, re-assembled in a body at St. Vallery,[301] for so that port\r\nis called by its new name. Collecting, therefore, ships from every\r\nquarter, they awaited the propitious gale which was to carry them to\r\ntheir destination. When this delayed blowing for several days, the\r\ncommon soldiers, as is generally the case, began to mutter in their\r\ntents, “that the man must be mad, who wished to subjugate a foreign\r\ncountry; that God opposed him, who withheld the wind; that his father\r\npurposed a similar attempt, and was in like manner frustrated; that it\r\nwas the fate of that family to aspire to things beyond their reach, and\r\nfind God for their adversary.” In consequence of these things, which\r\nwere enough to enervate the force of the brave, being publicly noised\r\nabroad, the duke held a council with his chiefs, and ordered the body\r\nof St. Vallery to be brought forth, and to be exposed to the open air,\r\nfor the purpose of imploring a wind. No delay now interposed, but the\r\nwished-for gale filled their sails. A joyful clamour then arising,\r\nsummoned every one to the ships. The earl himself first launching from\r\nthe continent into the deep, awaited the rest, at anchor, nearly in\r\nmid-channel. All then assembled round the crimson sail of the admiral’s\r\nship; and, having first dined, they arrived, after a favourable\r\npassage, at Hastings. As he disembarked he slipped down, but turned the\r\naccident to his advantage; a soldier who stood near calling out to him,\r\n“you hold England,[302] my lord, its future king.” He then restrained\r\nhis whole army from plundering; warning them, that they should now\r\nabstain from what must hereafter be their own;[303] and for fifteen\r\nsuccessive days he remained so perfectly quiet, that he seemed to think\r\nof nothing less than of war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1066.] HAROLD’S SPIES TAKEN.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Harold returned from the battle with the Norwegians;\r\nhappy, in his own estimation, at having conquered; but not so in\r\nmine, as he had secured the victory by parricide. When the news of\r\nthe Norman’s arrival reached him, reeking as he was from battle, he\r\nproceeded to Hastings, though accompanied by very few forces. No doubt\r\nthe fates urged him on, as he neither summoned his troops, nor, had\r\nhe been willing to do so, would he have found many ready to obey his\r\ncall; so hostile were all to him, as I have before observed, from his\r\nhaving appropriated the northern spoils entirely to himself. He sent\r\nout some persons, however, to reconnoitre the number and strength of\r\nthe enemy: these, being taken within the camp, William ordered to be\r\nled amongst the tents, and, after feasting them plentifully, to be sent\r\nback uninjured to their lord. On their return, Harold inquired what\r\nnews they brought: when, after relating at full, the noble confidence\r\nof the general, they gravely added, that almost all his army had the\r\nappearance of priests, as they had the whole face, with both lips,\r\nshaven. For the English leave the upper lip unshorn, suffering the\r\nhair continually to increase; which Julius Cæsar, in his treatise on\r\nthe Gallic War,[304] affirms to have been a national custom with the\r\nancient inhabitants of Britain. The king smiled at the simplicity of\r\nthe relators, observing, with a pleasant laugh, that they were not\r\npriests, but soldiers, strong in arms, and invincible in spirit. His\r\nbrother, Girth, a youth, on the verge of manhood, and of knowledge and\r\nvalour surpassing his years, caught up his words: “Since,” said he,\r\n“you extol so much the valour of the Norman, I think it ill-advised\r\nfor you, who are his inferior in strength and desert, to contend with\r\nhim. Nor can you deny being bound to him, by oath, either willingly,\r\nor by compulsion. Wherefore you will act wisely, if, yourself\r\nwithdrawing from this pressing emergency, you allow us to try the\r\nissue of a battle. We, who are free from all obligation, shall justly\r\ndraw the sword in defence of our country. It is to be apprehended, if\r\nyou engage, that you will be either subjected to flight or to death:\r\nwhereas, if we only fight, your cause will be safe at all events: for\r\nyou will be able both to rally the fugitives, and to avenge the dead.”\r\n\r\nHis unbridled rashness yielded no placid ear to the words of his\r\nadviser, thinking it base, and a reproach to his past life, to turn his\r\nback on danger of any kind; and, with similar impudence, or to speak\r\nmore favourably, imprudence, he drove away a monk, the messenger of\r\nWilliam, not deigning him even a complacent look; imprecating only,\r\nthat God would decide between him and the earl. He was the bearer of\r\nthree propositions: either that Harold should relinquish the kingdom,\r\naccording to his agreement, or hold it of William; or decide the matter\r\nby single combat in the sight of either army. For William[305] claimed\r\nthe kingdom, on the ground that king Edward, by the advice of Stigand,\r\nthe archbishop, and of the earls Godwin and Siward, had granted it\r\nto him, and had sent the son and nephew of Godwin to Normandy, as\r\nsureties of the grant. If Harold should deny this, he would abide by\r\nthe judgment of the pope, or by battle: on all which propositions,\r\nthe messenger being frustrated by the single answer I have related,\r\nreturned, and communicated to his party fresh spirit for the conflict.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1066.] BATTLE OF HASTINGS.]\r\n\r\nThe courageous leaders mutually prepared for battle, each according\r\nto his national custom. The English, as we have heard, passed the\r\nnight without sleep, in drinking and singing, and, in the morning,\r\nproceeded without delay towards the enemy; all were on foot, armed with\r\nbattle-axes, and covering themselves in front by the junction of their\r\nshields, they formed an impenetrable body, which would have secured\r\ntheir safety that day, had not the Normans, by a feigned flight,\r\ninduced them to open their ranks, which till that time, according to\r\ntheir custom, were closely compacted. The king himself on foot, stood,\r\nwith his brother, near the standard; in order that, while all shared\r\nequal danger, none might think of retreating. This standard William\r\nsent, after the victory, to the pope; it was sumptuously embroidered,\r\nwith gold and precious stones, in the form of a man fighting.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the Normans passed the whole night in confessing\r\ntheir sins, and received the sacrament in the morning: their infantry,\r\nwith bows and arrows, formed the vanguard, while their cavalry, divided\r\ninto wings, were thrown back. The earl, with serene countenance,\r\ndeclaring aloud, that God would favour his, as being the righteous\r\nside, called for his arms; and presently, when, through the hurry of\r\nhis attendants, he had put on his hauberk the hind part before,[306]\r\nhe corrected the mistake with a laugh; saying, “My dukedom shall be\r\nturned into a kingdom.” Then beginning the song of Roland,[307] that\r\nthe warlike example of that man might stimulate the soldiers, and\r\ncalling on God for assistance, the battle commenced on both sides. They\r\nfought with ardour, neither giving ground, for great part of the day.\r\nFinding this, William gave a signal to his party, that, by a feigned\r\nflight, they should retreat. Through this device, the close body of\r\nthe English, opening for the purpose of cutting down the straggling\r\nenemy, brought upon itself swift destruction; for the Normans, facing\r\nabout, attacked them thus disordered, and compelled them to fly. In\r\nthis manner, deceived by a stratagem, they met an honourable death\r\nin avenging their country; nor indeed were they at all wanting to\r\ntheir own revenge, as, by frequently making a stand, they slaughtered\r\ntheir pursuers in heaps: for, getting possession of an eminence, they\r\ndrove down the Normans, when roused with indignation and anxiously\r\nstriving to gain the higher ground, into the valley beneath, where,\r\neasily hurling their javelins and rolling down stones on them as\r\nthey stood below, they destroyed them to a man. Besides, by a short\r\npassage, with which they were acquainted, avoiding a deep ditch, they\r\ntrod under foot such a multitude of their enemies in that place, that\r\nthey made the hollow level with the plain, by the heaps of carcasses.\r\nThis vicissitude of first one party conquering, and then the other,\r\nprevailed as long as the life of Harold continued; but when he fell,\r\nfrom having his brain pierced with an arrow, the flight of the English\r\nceased not until night. The valour of both leaders was here eminently\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\nHarold, not merely content with the duty of a general in exhorting\r\nothers, diligently entered into every soldier-like office; often would\r\nhe strike the enemy when coming to close quarters, so that none could\r\napproach him with impunity; for immediately the same blow levelled both\r\nhorse and rider. Wherefore, as I have related, receiving the fatal\r\narrow from a distance, he yielded to death. One of the soldiers with\r\na sword gashed his thigh, as he lay prostrate; for which shameful and\r\ncowardly action, he was branded with ignominy by William, and dismissed\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nWilliam too was equally ready to encourage by his voice and by his\r\npresence; to be the first to rush forward; to attack the thickest of\r\nthe foe. Thus everywhere raging, everywhere furious, he lost three\r\nchoice horses, which were that day pierced under him. The dauntless\r\nspirit and vigour of the intrepid general, however, still persisted,\r\nthough often called back by the kind remonstrance of his body-guard;\r\nhe still persisted, I say, till approaching night crowned him with\r\ncomplete victory. And no doubt, the hand of God so protected him, that\r\nthe enemy should draw no blood from his person, though they aimed so\r\nmany javelins at him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1066.] CUSTOMS OF THE ENGLISH.]\r\n\r\nThis was a fatal day to England, a melancholy havoc of our dear\r\ncountry, through its change of masters. For it had long since adopted\r\nthe manners of the Angles, which had been very various according to the\r\ntimes: for in the first years of their arrival, they were barbarians\r\nin their look and manners, warlike in their usages, heathens in their\r\nrites; but, after embracing the faith of Christ, by degrees, and in\r\nprocess of time, from the peace they enjoyed, regarding arms only\r\nin a secondary light, they gave their whole attention to religion.\r\nI say nothing of the poor, the meanness of whose fortune often\r\nrestrains them from overstepping the bounds of justice: I omit men of\r\necclesiastical rank, whom sometimes respect to their profession, and\r\nsometimes the fear of shame, suffer not to deviate from the truth: I\r\nspeak of princes, who from the greatness of their power might have\r\nfull liberty to indulge in pleasure; some of whom, in their own\r\ncountry, and others at Rome, changing their habit, obtained a heavenly\r\nkingdom, and a saintly intercourse. Many during their whole lives in\r\noutward appearance only embraced the present world, in order that they\r\nmight exhaust their treasures on the poor, or divide them amongst\r\nmonasteries. What shall I say of the multitudes of bishops, hermits,\r\nand abbats? Does not the whole island blaze with such numerous relics\r\nof its natives, that you can scarcely pass a village of any consequence\r\nbut you hear the name of some new saint, besides the numbers of whom\r\nall notices have perished through the want of records? Nevertheless, in\r\nprocess of time, the desire after literature and religion had decayed,\r\nfor several years before the arrival of the Normans. The clergy,\r\ncontented with a very slight degree of learning, could scarcely stammer\r\nout the words of the sacraments; and a person who understood grammar,\r\nwas an object of wonder and astonishment. The monks mocked the rule\r\nof their order by fine vestments, and the use of every kind of food.\r\nThe nobility, given up to luxury and wantonness, went not to church in\r\nthe morning after the manner of Christians, but merely, in a careless\r\nmanner, heard matins and masses from a hurrying priest in their\r\nchambers, amid the blandishments of their wives. The commonalty, left\r\nunprotected, became a prey to the most powerful, who amassed fortunes,\r\nby either seizing on their property, or by selling their persons into\r\nforeign countries; although it be an innate quality of this people,\r\nto be more inclined to revelling, than to the accumulation of wealth.\r\nThere was one custom, repugnant to nature, which they adopted; namely,\r\nto sell their female servants, when pregnant by them and after they\r\nhad satisfied their lust, either to public prostitution, or foreign\r\nslavery. Drinking in parties was a universal practice, in which\r\noccupation they passed entire nights as well as days. They consumed\r\ntheir whole substance in mean and despicable houses; unlike the Normans\r\nand French, who, in noble and splendid mansions, lived with frugality.\r\nThe vices attendant on drunkenness, which enervate the human mind,\r\nfollowed; hence it arose that engaging William, more with rashness,\r\nand precipitate fury, than military skill, they doomed themselves,\r\nand their country to slavery, by one, and that an easy, victory. “For\r\nnothing is less effective than rashness; and what begins with violence,\r\nquickly ceases, or is repelled.” In fine, the English at that time,\r\nwore short garments reaching to the mid-knee; they had their hair\r\ncropped; their beards shaven; their arms laden with golden bracelets;\r\ntheir skin adorned with punctured designs. They were accustomed to eat\r\ntill they became surfeited, and to drink till they were sick. These\r\nlatter qualities they imparted to their conquerors; as to the rest,\r\nthey adopted their manners. I would not, however, have these bad\r\npropensities universally ascribed to the English. I know that many of\r\nthe clergy, at that day, trod the path of sanctity, by a blameless\r\nlife; I know that many of the laity, of all ranks and conditions, in\r\nthis nation, were well-pleasing to God. Be injustice far from this\r\naccount; the accusation does not involve the whole indiscriminately.\r\n“But, as in peace, the mercy of God often cherishes the bad and the\r\ngood together; so, equally, does his severity, sometimes, include them\r\nboth in captivity.”\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Normans, that I may speak of them also, were at that\r\ntime, and are even now, proudly apparelled, delicate in their food,\r\nbut not excessive. They are a race inured to war, and can hardly live\r\nwithout it; fierce in rushing against the enemy; and where strength\r\nfails of success, ready to use stratagem, or to corrupt by bribery. As\r\nI have related, they live in large edifices with economy; envy their\r\nequals; wish to excel their superiors; and plunder their subjects,\r\nthough they defend them from others; they are faithful to their lords,\r\nthough a slight offence renders them perfidious. They weigh treachery\r\nby its chance of success, and change their sentiments with money.\r\nThey are, however, the kindest of nations, and they esteem strangers\r\nworthy of equal honour with themselves. They also intermarry with their\r\nvassals. They revived, by their arrival, the observances of religion,\r\nwhich were everywhere grown lifeless in England. You might see churches\r\nrise in every village, and monasteries in the towns and cities, built\r\nafter a style unknown before; you might behold the country flourishing\r\nwith renovated rites; so that each wealthy man accounted that day lost\r\nto him, which he had neglected to signalize by some magnificent action.\r\nBut having enlarged sufficiently on these points, let us pursue the\r\ntransactions of William.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1066.] WILLIAM’S CORONATION.]\r\n\r\nWhen his victory was complete, he caused his dead to be interred with\r\ngreat pomp; granting the enemy the liberty of doing the like, if\r\nthey thought proper. He sent the body of Harold[308] to his mother,\r\nwho begged it, unransomed; though she proffered large sums by her\r\nmessengers. She buried it, when thus obtained, at Waltham; a church\r\nwhich he had built at his own expense, in honour of the Holy Cross,\r\nand had endowed for canons. William then, by degrees proceeding,\r\nas became a conqueror, with his army, not after an hostile, but a\r\nroyal manner, journeyed towards London, the principal city of the\r\nkingdom; and shortly after, all the citizens came out to meet him with\r\ngratulations. Crowds poured out of every gate to greet him, instigated\r\nby the nobility, and principally by Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nand Aldred, of York. For, shortly before, Edwin and Morcar, two\r\nbrothers of great expectation, hearing, at London, the news of Harold’s\r\ndeath, solicited the citizens to exalt one of them to the throne:\r\nfailing, however, in the attempt, they had departed for Northumberland,\r\nconjecturing, from their own feelings, that William would never come\r\nthither. The other chiefs would have chosen Edgar, had the bishops\r\nsupported them; but, danger and domestic broils closely impending,\r\nneither did this take effect. Thus the English, who, had they united in\r\none opinion, might have repaired the ruin of their country, introduced\r\na stranger, while they were unwilling to choose a native, to govern\r\nthem. Being now decidedly hailed king, he was crowned on Christmas-day\r\nby archbishop Aldred; for he was careful not to accept this office from\r\nStigand, as he was not canonically an archbishop.\r\n\r\nOf the various wars which he carried on, this is a summary. Favoured by\r\nGod’s assistance, he easily reduced the city of Exeter,[309] when it\r\nhad rebelled; for part of the wall fell down accidentally, and made\r\nan opening for him. Indeed he had attacked it with the more ferocity,\r\nasserting that those irreverent men would be deserted by God’s favour,\r\nbecause one of them, standing upon the wall, had bared his posteriors,\r\nand had broken wind, in contempt of the Normans. He almost annihilated\r\nthe city of York, that sole remaining shelter for rebellion, and\r\ndestroyed its citizens with sword and famine. For there Malcolm, king\r\nof the Scots, with his party; there Edgar, and Morcar, and Waltheof,\r\nwith the English and Danes, often brooded over the nest of tyranny;\r\nthere they frequently killed his generals; whose deaths, were I\r\nseverally to commemorate, perhaps I should not be superfluous, though I\r\nmight risk the peril of creating disgust; while I should be not easily\r\npardoned as an historian, if I were led astray by the falsities of my\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nMalcolm willingly received all the English fugitives, affording to each\r\nevery protection in his power, but more especially to Edgar, whose\r\nsister he had married, out of regard to her noble descent. On his\r\nbehalf he burnt and plundered the adjacent provinces of England; not\r\nthat he supposed, by so doing, he could be of any service to him, with\r\nrespect to the kingdom; but merely to distress the mind of William, who\r\nwas incensed at his territories being subject to Scottish incursions.\r\nIn consequence, William, collecting a body of foot and horse, repaired\r\nto the northern parts of the island, and first of all received into\r\nsubjection the metropolitan city, which English, Danes, and Scots\r\nobstinately defended; its citizens being wasted with continued want.\r\nHe destroyed also in a great and severe battle, a considerable number\r\nof the enemy, who had come to the succour of the besieged; though the\r\nvictory was not bloodless on his side, as he lost many of his people.\r\nHe then ordered both the towns and fields of the whole district to\r\nbe laid waste; the fruits and grain to be destroyed by fire or by\r\nwater, more especially on the coast, as well on account of his recent\r\ndispleasure, as because a rumour had gone abroad, that Canute, king of\r\nDenmark, the son of Sweyn, was approaching with his forces. The reason\r\nof such a command, was, that the plundering pirate should find no booty\r\non the coast to take with him, if he designed to depart again directly;\r\nor should be compelled to provide against want, if he thought proper\r\nto stay. Thus the resources of a province,[310] once flourishing, and\r\nthe nurse of tyrants, were cut off by fire, slaughter, and devastation;\r\nthe ground, for more than sixty miles, totally uncultivated and\r\nunproductive, remains bare to the present day. Should any stranger\r\nnow see it, he laments over the once-magnificent cities; the towers\r\nthreatening heaven itself with their loftiness; the fields abundant\r\nin pasturage, and watered with rivers: and, if any ancient inhabitant\r\nremains, he knows it no longer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1068.] SURRENDER OF MALCOLM.]\r\n\r\nMalcolm surrendered himself, without coming to an engagement, and for\r\nthe whole of William’s time passed his life under treaties, uncertain,\r\nand frequently broken. But when in the reign of William, the son of\r\nWilliam, he was attacked in a similar manner, he diverted the king from\r\npursuing him by a false oath. He was slain soon after, together with\r\nhis son, by Robert Mowbray, earl of Northumberland, while, regardless\r\nof his faith, he was devastating the province with more than usual\r\ninsolence. For many years, he lay buried at Tynemouth: lately he was\r\nconveyed by Alexander his son, to Dunfermlin, in Scotland.\r\n\r\nEdgar, having submitted to the king with Stigand and Aldred the\r\narchbishops, violated his oath the following year, by going over to\r\nthe Scot: but after living there some years, and acquiring no present\r\nadvantage, no future prospects, but merely his daily sustenance,\r\nbeing willing to try the liberality of the Norman, who was at that\r\ntime beyond the sea, he sailed over to him. They say this was\r\nextremely agreeable to the king, that England should be thus rid of\r\na fomenter of dissension. Indeed it was his constant practice, under\r\ncolour of high honour, to carry over to Normandy all the English he\r\nsuspected, lest any disorders should arise in the kingdom during his\r\nabsence. Edgar, therefore, was well received, and presented with a\r\nconsiderable largess: and remaining at court for many years, silently\r\nsunk into contempt through his indolence, or more mildly speaking,\r\nhis simplicity. For how great must his simplicity be, who would yield\r\nup to the king, for a single horse, the pound of silver, which he\r\nreceived as his daily stipend? In succeeding times he went to Jerusalem\r\nwith Robert, the son of Godwin,[311] a most valiant knight. This was\r\nthe time when the Turks besieged king Baldwin, at Rama; who, unable\r\nto endure the difficulties of a siege, rushed through the midst of\r\nthe enemy, by the assistance of Robert alone, who preceded him, and\r\nhewed down the Turks, on either hand, with his drawn sword; but, while\r\nexcited to greater ferocity by his success, he was pressing on with\r\ntoo much eagerness, his sword dropped from his hand, and when stooping\r\ndown to recover it, he was surrounded by a multitude, and cast into\r\nchains. Taken thence to Babylon, as they report, when he refused to\r\ndeny Christ, he was placed as a mark in the middle of the market-place,\r\nand being transfixed with darts, died a martyr. Edgar, having lost\r\nhis companion, returned, and received many gifts from the Greek and\r\nGerman emperors; who, from respect to his noble descent, would also\r\nhave endeavoured to retain him with them; but he gave up every thing,\r\nthrough regard to his native soil. “For, truly, the love of their\r\ncountry deceives some men to such a degree, that nothing seems pleasant\r\nto them, unless they can breathe their native air.” Edgar, therefore,\r\ndeluded by this silly desire, returned to England; where, as I have\r\nbefore said, after various revolutions of fortune, he now grows old in\r\nthe country in privacy and quiet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1103.] OF EDWIN AND MORCAR.]\r\n\r\nEdwin and Morcar were brothers; the sons of Elfgar, the son of Leofric.\r\nThey had received charge of the county of Northumberland, and jointly\r\npreserved it in tranquillity. For, as I have before observed, a few\r\ndays previous to the death of St. Edward the king, the inhabitants of\r\nthe north had risen in rebellion and expelled Tosty, their governor;\r\nand, with Harold’s approbation, had requested, and received, one of\r\nthese brothers, as their lord. These circumstances, as we have heard\r\nfrom persons acquainted with the affair, took place against the\r\ninclination of the king, who was attached to Tosty; but being languid\r\nthrough disease, and worn down with age, he become so universally\r\ndisregarded, that he could not assist his favourite. In consequence,\r\nhis bodily ailments increasing from the anxiety of his mind, he died\r\nshortly after. Harold persisted in his resolution of banishing his\r\nbrother: wherefore, first tarnishing the triumphs of his family by\r\npiratical excursions, he was, as I have above written, afterwards\r\nkilled with the king of Norway. His body being known by a wart between\r\nthe shoulders, obtained burial at York. Edwin and Morcar, by Harold’s\r\ncommand, then conveyed the spoils of war to London, for he himself was\r\nproceeding rapidly to the battle of Hastings; where, falsely presaging,\r\nhe looked upon the victory as already gained. But, when he was there\r\nkilled, the brothers, flying to the territories they possessed,\r\ndisturbed the peace of William for several years; infesting the woods\r\nwith secret robberies, and never coming to close or open engagement.\r\nOften were they taken captive, and as often surrendered themselves,\r\nbut were again dismissed with impunity, from pity to their youthful\r\nelegance, or respect to their nobility. At last, murdered, neither by\r\nthe force nor craft of their enemies, but by the treachery of their\r\npartisans, their fate drew tears from the king, who would even long\r\nsince have granted them matches with his relations, and the honour of\r\nhis friendship, would they have acceded to terms of peace.\r\n\r\nWaltheof, an earl of high descent, had become extremely intimate with\r\nthe new king, who had forgotten his former offences, and attributed\r\nthem rather to courage, than to disloyalty. For Waltheof, singly, had\r\nkilled many of the Normans in the battle of York; cutting off their\r\nheads, one by one, as they entered the gate. He was muscular in the\r\narms, brawny in the chest, tall and robust in his whole person; the son\r\nof Siward, a most celebrated earl, whom, by a Danish term, they called\r\n“Digera,” which implies Strong. But after the fall of his party, he\r\nvoluntarily surrendered himself, and was honoured by a marriage with\r\nJudith, the king’s niece, as well as with his personal friendship.\r\nUnable however to restrain his evil inclinations, he could not preserve\r\nhis fidelity. For all his countrymen, who had thought proper to resist,\r\nbeing either slain, or subdued, he became a party even in the perfidy\r\nof Ralph de Waher; but the conspiracy being detected,[312] he was\r\ntaken; kept in chains for some time, and at last, being beheaded, was\r\nburied at Croyland: though some assert, that he joined the league of\r\ntreachery, more through circumvention than inclination. This is the\r\nexcuse the English make for him, and those, of the greater credit,\r\nfor the Normans affirm the contrary, to whose decision the Divinity\r\nitself appears to assent, showing many and very great miracles at his\r\ntomb: for they declare, that during his captivity, he wiped away his\r\ntransgressions by his daily penitence.\r\n\r\nOn this account perhaps the conduct of the king may reasonably be\r\nexcused, if he was at any time rather severe against the English;\r\nfor he scarcely found any one of them faithful. This circumstance so\r\nexasperated his ferocious mind, that he deprived the more powerful,\r\nfirst of their wealth, next of their estates, and finally, some of\r\nthem of their lives. Moreover, he followed the device of Cæsar, who\r\ndrove out the Germans, concealed in the vast forest of Ardennes,\r\nwhence they harassed his army with perpetual irruptions, not by means\r\nof his own countrymen, but by the confederate Gauls; that, while\r\nstrangers destroyed each other, he might gain a bloodless victory.\r\nThus, I say, William acted towards the English. For, allowing the\r\nNormans to be unemployed, he opposed an English army, and an English\r\ncommander, to those, who, after the first unsuccessful battle, had\r\nfled to Denmark and Ireland, and had returned at the end of three\r\nyears with considerable force: foreseeing that whichever side might\r\nconquer, it must be a great advantage to himself. Nor did this device\r\nfail him; for both parties of the English, after some conflicts\r\nbetween themselves, without any exertion on his part, left a victory\r\nfor the king; the invaders being driven to Ireland, and the royalists\r\npurchasing the empty title of conquest, at their own special loss, and\r\nthat of their general. His name was Ednoth,[313] equally celebrated,\r\nbefore the arrival of the Normans, both at home and abroad. He was the\r\nfather of Harding, who yet survives: a man more accustomed to kindle\r\nstrife by his malignant tongue, than to brandish arms in the field\r\nof battle. Thus having overturned the power of the laity, he made\r\nan ordinance, that no monk, or clergyman, of that nation, should be\r\nsuffered to aspire to any dignity whatever; excessively differing from\r\nthe gentleness of Canute the former king, who restored their honours,\r\nunimpaired, to the conquered: whence it came to pass, that at his\r\ndecease, the natives easily expelled the foreigners, and reclaimed\r\ntheir original right. But William, from certain causes, canonically\r\ndeposed some persons, and in the place of such as might die, appointed\r\ndiligent men of any nation, except English. Unless I am deceived, their\r\ninveterate frowardness towards the king, required such a measure;\r\nsince, as I have said before, the Normans are by nature kindly disposed\r\nto strangers who live amongst them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1074.] RALPH DE WALER.]\r\n\r\nRalph, whom I mentioned before, was, by the king’s gift, earl\r\nof Norfolk and Suffolk; a Breton on his father’s side; of a\r\ndisposition foreign to every thing good. This man, in consequence\r\nof being betrothed to the king’s relation, the daughter of William\r\nFitz-Osberne, conceived a most unjust design, and meditated attack on\r\nthe sovereignty. Wherefore, on the very day of his nuptials, whilst\r\nsplendidly banqueting, for the luxury of the English had now been\r\nadopted by the Normans, and when the guests had become intoxicated and\r\nheated with wine, he disclosed his intention in a copious harangue. As\r\ntheir reason was entirely clouded by drunkenness, they loudly applauded\r\nthe orator. Here Roger earl of Hereford, brother to the wife of Ralph,\r\nand here Waltheof, together with many others, conspired the death of\r\nthe king. Next day, however, when the fumes of the wine had evaporated,\r\nand cooler thoughts influenced the minds of some of the party, the\r\nlarger portion, repenting of their conduct, retired from the meeting.\r\nAmong these is said to have been Waltheof, who, at the recommendation\r\nof archbishop Lanfranc, sailing to Normandy, related the matter to\r\nthe king; concealing merely his own share of the business. The earls,\r\nhowever, persisted in their design, and each incited his dependents\r\nto rebel. But God opposed them, and brought all their machinations to\r\nnought. For immediately the king’s officers, who were left in charge,\r\non discovering the affair, reduced Ralph to such distress, that seizing\r\na vessel at Norwich, he committed himself to the sea. His wife,\r\ncovenanting for personal safety, and delivering up the castle, followed\r\nher husband. Roger being thrown into chains by the king, visited, or\r\nrather inhabited, a prison, during the remainder of his life; a young\r\nman of abominable treachery, and by no means imitating his father’s\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1074.] WILLIAM FITZ-OSBERNE.]\r\n\r\nHis father, indeed, William Fitz-Osberne,[314] might have been\r\ncompared, nay, I know not if he might not even have been preferred, to\r\nthe very best princes. By his advice, William had first been inspirited\r\nto invade, and next, assisted by his valour, to keep possession of\r\nEngland. The energy of his mind was seconded by the almost boundless\r\nliberality of his hand. Hence it arose, that by the multitude of\r\nsoldiers, to whom he gave extravagant pay, he repelled the rapacity of\r\nthe enemy, and ensured the favour of the people. In consequence, by\r\nthis boundless profusion, he incurred the king’s severe displeasure;\r\nbecause he had improvidently exhausted his treasures. The regulations\r\nwhich he established in his county of Hereford, remain in full force\r\nat the present day; that is to say, that no knight[315] should be\r\nfined more than seven shillings for whatever offence: whereas, in\r\nother provinces, for a very small fault in transgressing the commands\r\nof their lord, they pay twenty or twenty-five. Fortune, however,\r\nclosed these happy successes by a dishonourable termination, when the\r\nsupporter of so great a government, the counsellor of England and\r\nNormandy, went into Flanders, through fond regard for a woman, and\r\nthere died by the hands of his enemies. For the elder Baldwin, of whom\r\nI have before spoken, the father of Matilda, had two sons; Robert, who\r\nmarrying the countess of Frisia, while his father yet lived, took the\r\nsurname of Friso: Baldwin, who, after his father, presided some years\r\nover Flanders, and died prematurely. His two children by his wife\r\nRichelda surviving he had entrusted the guardianship of them to Philip\r\nking of France, whose aunt was his mother, and to William Fitz-Osberne.\r\nWilliam readily undertook this office, that he might increase his\r\ndignity by an union with Richelda. But she, through female pride,\r\naspiring to things beyond her sex, and exacting fresh tributes from the\r\npeople, excited them to rebellion. Wherefore despatching a messenger to\r\nRobert Friso, they entreat him to accept the government of the country;\r\nand abjure all fidelity to Arnulph, who was already called earl. Nor\r\nindeed were there wanting persons to espouse the party of the minor: so\r\nthat for a long time, Flanders was disturbed by intestine commotion.\r\nThis, Fitz-Osberne, who was desperately in love with the lady, could\r\nnot endure, but entered Flanders with a body of troops; and, being\r\nimmediately well received by the persons he came to defend, after some\r\ndays, he rode securely from castle to castle, in a hasty manner with\r\nfew attendants. On the other hand, Friso, who was acquainted with this\r\npiece of folly, entrapped him unawares by a secret ambush, and killed\r\nhim, fighting bravely but to no purpose, together with his nephew\r\nArnulph.\r\n\r\nThus possessed of Flanders, he often irritated king William, by\r\nplundering Normandy. His daughter married Canute king of the Danes,\r\nof whom was born Charles,[316] who now rules in Flanders. He made\r\npeace with king Philip, giving him his daughter-in-law in marriage,\r\nby whom he had Lewis, who at present reigns in France; but not long\r\nafter, being heartily tired of the match, because his queen was\r\nextremely corpulent, he removed her from his bed, and in defiance of\r\nlaw and equity, married the wife of the earl of Anjou. Robert, safe\r\nby his affinity with these princes, encountered nothing to distress\r\nhim during his government; though Baldwin, the brother of Arnulph,\r\nwho had an earldom in the province of Hainault and in the castle of\r\nValenciennes, by William’s assistance made many attempts for that\r\npurpose. Three years before his death, when he was now hoary-headed,\r\nhe went to Jerusalem, for the mitigation of his transgressions. After\r\nhis return he renounced the world, calmly awaiting his dissolution with\r\nChristian earnestness. His son was that Robert so universally famed in\r\nthe expedition into Asia, which, in our times, Europe undertook against\r\nthe Turks; but through some mischance, after his return home, he\r\ntarnished that noble exploit, being mortally wounded in a tournament,\r\nas they call it. Nor did a happier fate attend his son Baldwin, who,\r\nvoluntarily harassing the forces of Henry king of England, in Normandy,\r\npaid dearly for his youthful temerity: for, being struck on the head\r\nwith a pole, and deceived by the professions of several physicians, he\r\nlost his life; the principality devolving on Charles, of whom we have\r\nspoken before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1073.] DEFEAT OF THE DANES.]\r\n\r\nNow, king William conducting himself with mildness towards the obedient\r\nbut with severity to the rebellious, possessed the whole of England\r\nin tranquillity, holding all the Welsh tributary to him. At this time\r\ntoo, beyond sea, being never unemployed, he nearly annihilated the\r\ncounty of Maine, leading thither an expedition composed of English;\r\nwho, though they had been easily conquered in their own, yet always\r\nappeared invincible in a foreign country. He lost multitudes of his men\r\nat Dol,[317] a town of Brittany, whither, irritated by some broil, he\r\nhad led a military force. He constantly found Philip king of France,\r\nthe daughter of whose aunt he had married, unfaithful to him; because\r\nhe was envious of the great glory of a man who was vassal both to his\r\nfather and to himself. But William did not the less actively resist his\r\nattempts, although his first-born son Robert, through evil counsel,\r\nassisted him in opposition to his father. Whence it happened, that\r\nin an attack at Gerborai, the son became personally engaged with\r\nhis father; wounded him and killed his horse: William, the second\r\nson, departed with a hurt also, and many of the king’s party were\r\nslain. In all other respects, during the whole of his life, he was\r\nso fortunate, that foreign and distant nations feared nothing more\r\nthan his name. He had subdued the inhabitants so completely to his\r\nwill, that without any opposition, he first caused an account to be\r\ntaken of every person; compiled a register of the rent of every estate\r\nthroughout England;[318] and made all free men, of every description,\r\ntake the oath of fidelity to him. Canute, king of the Danes, who was\r\nmost highly elevated both by his affinity to Robert Friso and by\r\nhis own power, alone menaced his dignity; a rumour being generally\r\nprevalent, that he would invade England, a country due to him from his\r\nrelationship to the ancient Canute: and indeed he would have effected\r\nit, had not God counteracted his boldness by an unfavourable wind. But\r\nthis circumstance reminds me briefly to trace the genealogy of the\r\nDanish kings, who succeeded after our Canute; adding at the same time,\r\nsomewhat concerning the Norwegians.\r\n\r\nAs it has been before observed, Harold succeeded in England;\r\nHardecanute, and his sons, in Denmark: for Magnus the son of Olave,\r\nwhom I have mentioned in the history of our Canute, as having been\r\nkilled by his subjects, had recovered Norway, which Canute had subdued.\r\nHarold dying in England, Hardecanute held both kingdoms for a short\r\ntime. On his decease, Edward the Simple succeeded, who, satisfied with\r\nhis paternal kingdom, despised his foreign dominions as burdensome and\r\nbarbarous. One Sweyn, doubtlessly a most exalted character, was then\r\nmade king of the Danes.[319] When his government had prospered for\r\nseveral years, Magnus, king of the Norwegians, with the consent of some\r\nof the Danes, expelled him by force, and subjected the land to his own\r\nwill. Sweyn, thus expelled, went to the king of Sweden, and collecting,\r\nby his assistance, Swedes, Vandals, and Goths, he returned, to regain\r\nthe kingdom: but, through the exertions of the Danes, who were attached\r\nto the government of Magnus, he experienced a repetition of his\r\nformer ill-fortune. This was a great and memorable battle among those\r\nbarbarous people: on no other occasion did the Danes ever experience\r\nseverer conflict, or happier success. Indeed, to this very time, they\r\nkeep unbroken the vow, by which they had bound themselves, before the\r\ncontest, that they would consecrate to future ages the vigil of St.\r\nLawrence, for on that day the battle was fought, by fasting and alms;\r\nand then also Sweyn fled, but soon after, on the death of Magnus, he\r\nreceived his kingdom entire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1069.] DENMARK AND NORWAY.]\r\n\r\nTo Magnus, in Norway, succeeded one Sweyn, surnamed Hardhand; not\r\nelevated by royal descent, but by boldness and cunning: to him Olave,\r\nthe uncle of Magnus, whom they call a saint; to Olave, Harold Harvagre,\r\nthe brother of Olave, who had formerly, when a young man, served\r\nunder the emperor of Constantinople. Being, at his command, exposed\r\nto a lion, for having debauched a woman of quality, he strangled the\r\nhuge beast by the bare vigour of his arms. He was slain in England by\r\nHarold, the son of Godwin. His sons, Olave and Magnus, divided the\r\nkingdom of their father; but Magnus dying prematurely, Olave seized\r\nthe whole. To him succeeded his son Magnus, who was lately miserably\r\nslain in Ireland, on which he had rashly made a descent. They relate,\r\nthat Magnus, the elder son of Harold, was, after the death of his\r\nfather, compassionately sent home by Harold, king of England; and that\r\nin return for this kindness, he humanely treated Harold, the son of\r\nHarold, when he came to him after William’s victory: that he took him\r\nwith him, in an expedition he made to England, in the time of William\r\nthe younger, when he conquered the Orkney and Mevanian Isles,[320]\r\nand meeting with Hugo, earl of Chester, and Hugo, earl of Shrewsbury,\r\nput the first to flight, and the second to death. The sons of the\r\nlast Magnus, Hasten and Siward, yet reign conjointly, having divided\r\nthe empire: the latter, a seemly and spirited youth, shortly since\r\nwent to Jerusalem, passing through England, and performed many famous\r\nexploits against the Saracens; more especially in the siege of Sidon,\r\nwhose inhabitants raged furiously against the Christians through their\r\nconnection with the Turks.\r\n\r\nBut Sweyn, as I have related, on his restoration to the sovereignty\r\nof the Danes, being impatient of quiet, sent his son Canute twice\r\ninto England; first with three hundred, and then with two hundred,\r\nships. His associate in the former expedition was Osbern, the brother\r\nof Sweyn; in the latter, Hacco: but, being each of them bribed, they\r\nfrustrated the young man’s designs, and returned home without effecting\r\ntheir purpose. In consequence, becoming highly disgraced by king\r\nSweyn for bartering their fidelity for money, they were driven into\r\nbanishment. Sweyn, when near his end, bound all the inhabitants by\r\noath, that, as he had fourteen sons, they should confer the kingdom\r\non each of them in succession, as long as his issue remained. On his\r\ndecease, his son Harold succeeded for three years: to him Canute, whom\r\nhis father had formerly sent into England. Remembering his original\r\nfailure, he prepared, as we have heard, more than a thousand vessels\r\nagainst England: his father-in-law, Robert Friso, the possessor of\r\nsix hundred more, supporting him. But being detained, for almost\r\ntwo years, by the adverseness of the wind, he changed his design,\r\naffirming, that it must be by the determination of God, that he\r\ncould not put to sea: but afterwards, misled by the suggestions of\r\nsome persons, who attributed the failure of their passage to the\r\nconjurations of certain old women, he sentenced the chiefs, whose\r\nwives were accused of this transgression, to an intolerable fine;\r\ncast his brother, Olave, the principal of the suspected faction into\r\nchains, and sent him into exile to his father-in-law. The barbarians,\r\nin consequence, resenting this attack upon their liberty, killed him\r\nwhile in church, clinging to the altar, and promising reparation.\r\nThey say that many miracles were shown from heaven at that place;\r\nbecause he was a man strictly observant of fasting and almsgiving,\r\nand pursued the transgressors of the divine laws more rigorously than\r\nthose who offended against himself; from which circumstance, he was\r\nconsecrated a martyr by the pope of Rome. After him, the murderers,\r\nthat they might atone for their crime by some degree of good, redeemed\r\nOlave from captivity, for ten thousand marks. After ignobly reigning\r\nduring eight years, he left the government to his brother Henry:\r\nwho living virtuously for twenty-nine years, went to Jerusalem, and\r\nbreathed his last at sea. Nicholas, the fifth in the sovereignty, still\r\nsurvives.[321]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1085.] ROBERT GUISCARD.]\r\n\r\nThe king of Denmark then, as I have said, was the only obstacle to\r\nWilliam’s uninterrupted enjoyment: on whose account he enlisted such an\r\nimmense multitude of stipendiary soldiers out of every province on this\r\nside the mountains, that their numbers oppressed the kingdom. But he,\r\nwith his usual magnanimity, not regarding the expense, had engaged even\r\nHugo the Great, brother to the king of France, with his bands to serve\r\nin his army. He was accustomed to stimulate and incite his own valour,\r\nby the remembrance of Robert Guiscard; saying it was disgraceful to\r\nyield, in courage, to him whom he surpassed in rank. For Robert, born\r\nof middling parentage in Normandy, that is, neither very low nor very\r\nhigh, had gone, a few years before William’s arrival in England, with\r\nfifteen knights, into Apulia, to remedy the narrowness of his own\r\ncircumstances, by entering into the service of that inactive race\r\nof people. Not many years elapsed, ere, by the stupendous assistance\r\nof God, he reduced the whole country under his power. For where his\r\nstrength failed, his ingenuity was alert: first receiving the towns,\r\nand after, the cities into confederacy with him. Thus he became so\r\nsuccessful, as to make himself duke of Apulia and Calabria; his brother\r\nRichard, prince of Capua; and his other brother, Roger, earl of Sicily.\r\nAt last, giving Apulia to his son Roger, he crossed the Adriatic with\r\nhis other son Boamund, and taking Durazzo, was immediately proceeding\r\nagainst Alexius, emperor of Constantinople, when a messenger from\r\npope Hildebrand stopped him in the heat of his career. For Henry,\r\nemperor of Germany, son of that Henry we have before mentioned, being\r\nincensed against the pope, for having excommunicated him on account of\r\nthe ecclesiastical investitures, led an army against Rome; besieged\r\nit; expelled Hildebrand, and introduced Guibert of Ravenna. Guiscard\r\nlearning this by the letter of the expelled pope, left his son Boamund,\r\nwith the army, to follow up his designs, and returned to Apulia; where\r\nquickly getting together a body of Apulians and Normans, he proceeded\r\nto Rome. Nor did Henry wait for a messenger to announce his approach;\r\nbut, affrighted at the bare report, fled with his pretended pope. Rome,\r\nfreed from intruders, received its lawful sovereign; but soon after\r\nagain lost him by similar violence. Then too, Alexius, learning that\r\nRobert was called home by the urgency of his affairs, and hoping to\r\nput a finishing hand to the war, rushed against Boamund, who commanded\r\nthe troops which had been left. The Norman youth, however, observant\r\nof his native spirit, though far inferior in number, turned to flight,\r\nby dint of military skill, the undisciplined Greeks and the other\r\ncollected nations. At the same time, too, the Venetians, a people\r\nhabituated to the sea, attacking Guiscard, who having settled the\r\nobject of his voyage was now sailing back, met with a similar calamity:\r\npart were drowned or killed, the rest put to flight. He, continuing his\r\nintended expedition, induced many cities, subject to Alexius, to second\r\nhis views. The emperor took off, by crime, the man he was unable to\r\nsubdue by arms: falsely promising his wife an imperial match. By her\r\nartifices, he drank poison,[322] which she had prepared, and died;\r\ndeserving, had God so pleased, a nobler death: for he was unconquerable\r\nby the sword of an enemy, but fell a victim to domestic treachery. He\r\nwas buried at Venusium in Apulia, having the following epitaph:\r\n\r\n  Here Guiscard lies, the terror of the world,\r\n  Who from the Capitol Rome’s sovereign hurl’d.\r\n  No band collected could Alexis free,\r\n  Flight only; Venice, neither flight nor sea.\r\n\r\nAnd since mention has been made of Hildebrand, I shall relate some\r\nanecdotes of him, which I have not heard trivially, but from the sober\r\nrelation of a person who would swear that he had learned them from the\r\nmouth of Hugo abbat of Clugny; whom I admire and commend to notice,\r\nfrom the consideration, that he used to declare the secret thoughts of\r\nothers by the prophetic intuition of his mind. Pope Alexander, seeing\r\nthe energetic bent of his disposition, had made him chancellor[323] of\r\nthe holy see. In consequence, by virtue of his office, he used to go\r\nthrough the provinces to correct abuses. All ranks of people flocked\r\nto him, requiring judgment on various affairs; all secular power was\r\nsubject to him, as well out of regard to his sanctity as his office.\r\nWhence it happened, one day, when there was a greater concourse on\r\nhorseback than usual, that the abbat aforesaid, with his monks, was\r\ngently proceeding in the last rank; and beholding at a distance the\r\ndistinguished honour of this man, that so many earthly rulers awaited\r\nhis nod, he was revolving in his mind sentiments to the following\r\neffect: “By what dispensation of God was this fellow, of diminutive\r\nstature and obscure parentage, surrounded by a retinue of so many\r\nrich men? Doubtless, from having such a crowd of attendants, he was\r\nvain-glorious, and conceived loftier notions than were becoming.”\r\nScarcely, as I have said, had he imagined this in his heart, when the\r\narchdeacon, turning back his horse, and spurring him, cried out from\r\na distance, beckoning the abbat, “You,” said he, “you have imagined\r\nfalsely, wrongly deeming me guilty of a thing of which I am innocent\r\naltogether; for I neither impute this as glory to myself, if glory\r\nthat can be called which vanishes quickly, nor do I wish it to be so\r\nimputed by others, but to the blessed apostles, to whose servant it is\r\nexhibited.” Reddening with shame, and not daring to deny a tittle, he\r\nreplied only, “My lord, I pray thee, how couldst thou know the secret\r\nthought of my heart which I have communicated to no one?” “All that\r\ninward sentiment of yours,” said he, “was brought from your mouth to my\r\nears, as though by a pipe.”\r\n\r\nAgain, entering a country church, in the same province, they prostrated\r\nthemselves before the altar, side by side. When they had continued\r\ntheir supplications for a long period, the archdeacon looked on the\r\nabbat with an angry countenance. After they had prayed some time\r\nlonger, he went out, and asking the reason of his displeasure, received\r\nthis answer, “If you love me, do not again attack me with an injury of\r\nthis kind; my Lord Jesus Christ, beautiful beyond the sons of men, was\r\nvisibly present to my entreaties, listening to what I said and kindly\r\nlooking assent; but, attracted by the earnestness of your prayer,\r\nhe left me and turned to you. I think you will not deny it to be a\r\nspecies of injury to take from a friend the author of his salvation.\r\nMoreover, you are to know that mortality of mankind and destruction\r\nhang over this place; and the token by which I formed such a conclusion\r\nwas my seeing the angel of the Lord standing upon the altar with a\r\nnaked sword, and waving it to and fro: I possess a more manifest proof\r\nof the impending ruin, from the thick, cloudy air which, as you see,\r\nalready envelopes that province. Let us make haste to escape, then,\r\nlest we perish with the rest.” Having said this, they entered an inn\r\nfor refreshment; but, as soon as food was placed before them, the\r\nlamentations of the household took away their famished appetites: for\r\nfirst one, and then another, and presently many of the family suddenly\r\nlost their lives by some unseen disaster. The contagion then spreading\r\nto the adjoining houses, they mounted their mules, and departed, fear\r\nadding wings to their flight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1085.] OF POPE GREGORY VII.]\r\n\r\nHildebrand had presided for the pope at a council in Gaul, where many\r\nbishops being degraded, for having formerly acquired their churches by\r\nsimony, gave place to better men. There was one, to whom a suspicion\r\nof this apostacy attached, but he could neither be convicted by any\r\nwitnesses, nor confuted by any argument. When it was supposed he\r\nmust be completely foiled, still like the slippery snake he eluded\r\ndetection; so skilled was he in speaking, that he baffled all. Then\r\nsaid the archdeacon, “Let the oracle of God be resorted to, let man’s\r\neloquence cease; we know for certain that episcopal grace is the gift\r\nof the Holy Spirit, and that whosoever purchases a bishopric, supposes\r\nthe gift of the Holy Ghost may be procured by money. Before you then,\r\nwho are assembled by the will of the Holy Ghost, let him say, ‘Glory be\r\nto the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost,’ and if he shall\r\nspeak it articulately, and without hesitation, it will be manifest to\r\nme that he has obtained his office, not by purchase, but legally.”\r\nHe willingly accepted the condition, supposing nothing less than any\r\ndifficulty in these words; and indeed he perfectly uttered, “Glory be\r\nto the Father, and to the Son,” but he hesitated at the “Holy Ghost.”\r\nA clamour arose on all sides, but he was never able, by any exertion,\r\neither at that time or for the remainder of his life, to name the Holy\r\nSpirit. The abbat so often mentioned was a witness of this miracle;\r\nwho taking the deprived bishop with him into different places, often\r\nlaughed at the issue of the experiment. Any person doubting the\r\ncertainty of this relation, must be confuted by all Europe, which is\r\naware that the numbers of the Clugniac order were increased by this\r\nabbat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1085.] DESIDERIUS--VICTOR--ODO.]\r\n\r\nOn the death of Alexander, therefore, Hildebrand, called Gregory the\r\nSeventh, succeeded.[324] He openly asserted what others had whispered,\r\nexcommunicating those persons who, having been elected, should receive\r\nthe investiture[325] of their churches, by the ring and staff, through\r\nthe hands of the laity. On this account Henry, emperor of Germany,\r\nbeing incensed that he should so far presume without his concurrence,\r\nexpelled him from Rome, as I observed, after the expiration of eleven\r\nyears, and brought in Guibert. Not long after, the pope, being seized\r\nwith that fatal disease which he had no doubt would be mortal, was\r\nrequested by the cardinals to appoint his successor; referring him\r\nto the example of St. Peter, who, in the church’s earliest infancy,\r\nhad, while yet living, nominated Clement. He refused to follow this\r\nexample, because it had anciently been forbidden by councils: he would\r\nadvise, however, that if they wished a person powerful in worldly\r\nmatters, they should choose Desiderius, abbat of Cassino, who would\r\nquell the violence of Guibert successfully and opportunely by a\r\nmilitary force; but if they wanted a religious and eloquent man, they\r\nshould elect Odo bishop of Ostia. Thus died a man, highly acceptable\r\nto God, though perhaps rather too austere towards men. Indeed it is\r\naffirmed, that in the beginning of the first commotion between him\r\nand the emperor, he would not admit him within his doors, though\r\nbarefooted, and carrying shears[326] and scourges, despising a man\r\nguilty of sacrilege, and of incest with his own sister. The emperor,\r\nthus excluded, departed, vowing that this repulse should be the death\r\nof many a man. And immediately doing all the injury he was able to the\r\nRoman see, he excited thereby the favourers of the pope, on every side,\r\nto throw off their allegiance to himself; for one Rodulph, revolting at\r\nthe command of the pope, who had sent him a crown in the name of the\r\napostles, he was immersed on all sides in the tumult of war. But Henry,\r\never superior to ill fortune, at length subdued him and all others\r\nfaithlessly rebelling. At last, driven from his power, not by a foreign\r\nattack, but the domestic hatred of his son, he died miserably. To\r\nHildebrand succeeded Desiderius, called Victor, who at his first mass\r\nfell down dead, though from what mischance is unknown; the cup, if it\r\nbe possible to credit such a thing, being poisoned. The election then\r\nfell upon Odo, a Frenchman by birth, first archdeacon of Rheims, then\r\nprior of Clugny, afterwards bishop of Ostia, lastly pope by the name of\r\nUrban.\r\n\r\nThus far I shall be pardoned, for having digressed, as from the mention\r\nof William’s transactions, some things occurred which I thought it\r\nimproper to omit: now, the reader, who is so inclined, shall learn\r\nthe more common habits of his life, and his domestic manners. Above\r\nall then, he was humble to the servants of God; affable to the\r\nobedient; inexorable to the rebellious. He attended the offices of\r\nthe Christian religion, as much as a secular was able; so that he\r\ndaily was present at mass, and heard vespers and matins. He built\r\none monastery in England, and another in Normandy; that at Caen[327]\r\nfirst, which he dedicated to St. Stephen, and endowed with suitable\r\nestates, and most magnificent presents. There he appointed Lanfranc,\r\nafterwards archbishop of Canterbury, abbat: a man worthy to be compared\r\nto the ancients, in knowledge, and in religion: of whom it may be\r\ntruly said, “Cato the third is descended from heaven;” so much had an\r\nheavenly savour tinctured his heart and tongue; so much was the whole\r\nWestern world excited to the knowledge of the liberal arts, by his\r\nlearning; and so earnestly did the monastic profession labour in the\r\nwork of religion, either from his example, or authority. No sinister\r\nmeans profited a bishop in those days; nor could an abbat procure\r\nadvancement by purchase. He who had the best report for undeviating\r\nsanctity, was most honoured, and most esteemed both by the king and\r\nby the archbishop. William built another monastery near Hastings,\r\ndedicated to St. Martin, which was also called Battle, because there\r\nthe principal church stands on the very spot, where, as they report,\r\nHarold was found in the thickest heaps of the slain. When little more\r\nthan a boy, yet gifted with the wisdom of age, he removed his uncle\r\nMalger, from the archbishopric of Rouen. He was a man not ordinarily\r\nlearned, but, through his high rank, forgetful of his profession,\r\nhe gave too much attention to hunting and hawking; and consumed the\r\ntreasures of the church in riotous living. The fame of this getting\r\nabroad, he never, during his whole life-time, obtained the pall,\r\nbecause the holy see refused the distinction of that honour, to a man\r\nwho neglected his sacred office. Wherefore being frequently cited, his\r\nnephew reprehending his offences, and still conducting himself in the\r\nsame manner, he was, from the urgency of the case, ultimately degraded.\r\nSome report that there was a secret reason for his being deprived: that\r\nMatilda, whom William had married, was very nearly related to him:\r\nthat Malger, in consequence, through zeal for the Christian faith,\r\ncould not endure that they should riot in the bed of consanguinity;\r\nand that he hurled the weapon of excommunication against his nephew,\r\nand his consort: that, when the anger of the young man was roused by\r\nthe complaints of his wife, an occasion was sought out, through which\r\nthe persecutor of their crime might be driven from his see: but that\r\nafterwards, in riper years, for the expiation of their offence, he\r\nbuilt the monastery to St. Stephen at Caen; and she also one, in the\r\nsame town, to the Holy Trinity;[328] each of them choosing the inmates\r\naccording to their own sex.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1085.] MAURILIUS RETURNS FROM THE DEAD.]\r\n\r\nTo Malger succeeded Maurilius of Feschamp; a monk commendable for\r\nmany virtues, but principally for his abstinence. After a holy and\r\nwell-spent life, when he came, by the call of God, to his end, bereft\r\nof vital breath, he lay, as it were, dead for almost half a day.\r\nNevertheless, when preparation was made to carry him into the church,\r\nrecovering his breath, he bathed the by-standers in tears of joy, and\r\ncomforted them, when lost in amazement, with this address: “Let your\r\nminds be attentive while you hear the last words of your pastor. I have\r\ndied a natural death, but I am come back, to relate to you what I have\r\nseen; yet shall I not continue with you long, because it delights me to\r\nsleep in the Lord. The conductors of my spirit were adorned with every\r\nelegance both of countenance and attire; the gentleness of their speech\r\naccorded with the splendour of their garments; so much so, that I\r\ncould wish for nothing more than the attentions of such men. Delighted\r\ntherefore with their soothing approbation, I went, as it appeared to\r\nme, towards the east. A seat in paradise was promised me, which I was\r\nshortly to enter. In a moment, passing over Europe and entering Asia,\r\nwe came to Jerusalem; where, having worshipped the saints, we proceeded\r\nto Jordan. The residents on the hither bank joining company with my\r\nconductors, made a joyful party. I was now hastening to pass over\r\nthe river, through longing desire to see what was beyond it, when my\r\ncompanions informed me, that God had commanded, that I must first be\r\nterrified by the sight of the demons; in order that the venial sins,\r\nwhich I had not wiped out by confession, might be expiated, by the\r\ndread of terrific forms. As soon as this was said, there came opposite\r\nto me, such a multitude of devils, brandishing pointed weapons, and\r\nbreathing out fire, that the plain appeared like steel, and the air\r\nlike flame. I was so dreadfully alarmed at them, that had the earth\r\nclave asunder, or the heaven opened, I should not have known whither\r\nto have betaken myself for safety. Thus panic-struck, and doubting\r\nwhither to go, I suddenly recovered my life, though instantaneously\r\nabout to lose it again, that by this relation I might be serviceable to\r\nyour salvation, unless you neglect it:” and almost as soon as he had\r\nso said, he breathed out his soul. His body, then buried under ground,\r\nin the church of St. Mary, is now, by divine miracle, as they report,\r\nraised up more than three feet above the earth.\r\n\r\nMoreover, William, following up the design he had formerly begun in\r\nNormandy, permitted Stigand, the pretended and false archbishop, to\r\nbe deposed by the Roman cardinals and by Ermenfred bishop of Sion.\r\nWalkelin succeeded him at Winchester, whose good works, surpassing\r\nfame, will resist the power of oblivion, as long as the episcopal see\r\nshall there continue: in Kent succeeded Lanfranc, of whom I have before\r\nspoken, who was, by the gift of God, as resplendent in England,\r\n\r\n  As Lucifer, who bids the stars retire,\r\n  Day’s rosy harbinger with purple fire;\r\n\r\nso much did the monastic germ sprout by his care, so strongly grew\r\nthe pontifical power while he survived. The king was observant of his\r\nadvice in such wise, that he deemed it proper to concede whatever\r\nLanfranc asserted ought to be done. At his instigation also was\r\nabolished the infamous custom of those ill-disposed people who used\r\nto sell their slaves into Ireland. The credit of this action, I know\r\nnot exactly whether to attribute to Lanfranc, or to Wulstan bishop of\r\nWorcester; who would scarcely have induced the king, reluctant from the\r\nprofit it produced him, to this measure, had not Lanfranc commended it,\r\nand Wulstan, powerful from his sanctity of character, commanded it by\r\nepiscopal authority: Wulstan, than whom none could be more just; nor\r\ncould any in our time equal him in the power of miracles, or the gift\r\nof prophecy: of which I propose hereafter to relate some particulars,\r\nshould it meet his most holy approbation.\r\n\r\nBut since the die of fortune is subject to uncertain casts, many\r\nadverse circumstances happened during those times. There was a\r\ndisgraceful contention[329] between the abbat of Glastonbury and his\r\nmonks; so that after altercation they came to blows. The monks being\r\ndriven into the church, bewailed their miseries at the holy altar. The\r\nsoldiers, rushing in, slew two of them, wounded fourteen, and drove\r\naway the rest. Nay the rage of the military had even bristled the\r\ncrucifix with arrows. The abbat, rendered infamous by such a criminal\r\noutrage, was driven into exile during the whole of the king’s life;\r\nbut, upon his decease, he was restored to his honours, a sum of money\r\nbeing paid to such as interceded for him, for the expiation of his\r\ntransgression.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1080.] BISHOP WALKER MURDERED.]\r\n\r\nAgain, a cruel and ignominious end overtook Walker bishop of Durham,\r\nwhom the Northumbrians, a people ever ripe for rebellion, throwing off\r\nall respect for his holy orders, put to death, after having severely\r\ninsulted him. A considerable number of Lorrainers were killed there\r\nalso, for the bishop was of that country. The cause of the murder was\r\nthis. The bishop, independently of his see, was warder[330] of the\r\nwhole county: over public business he had set his relation Gilbert,\r\nand over domestic, the canon Leobin; both men of diligence in their\r\nrespective employments, but rash. The bishop endured their want of\r\nmoderation in this respect, out of regard to their activity; and,\r\nas he had placed them in office, treated them with great kindness.\r\n“For our nature ever indulges itself, and favourably regards its own\r\nkind works.” This Leobin caused Liwulph, a servant so dearly beloved\r\nby St. Cuthbert that the saint himself used to appear to him, even\r\nwhen waking, and prescribe his decisions; him, I say, he caused to\r\nbe killed by Gilbert; smitten with envy at his holding the higher\r\nplace in the prelate’s esteem for his knowledge and equity in legal\r\ndeterminations. Walker, terrified with this intelligence, offered the\r\nfurious family of the deceased the result of a legal inquiry,[331]\r\naffirming that Leobin would be the cause of his death and of that of\r\nhis friends. When the matter came to a trial, this ferocious race of\r\npeople were not to be soothed by reasons of any kind; on the contrary,\r\nthey threw the whole blame on the bishop, because they had seen both\r\nthe murderers familiarly entertained in his court after the death of\r\nLiwulph. Hence arose clamour and indignation, and Gilbert, as he was\r\nof his own accord, going out of the church, where he had been sitting\r\nwith the bishop, that he might, at his personal peril, save the life of\r\nhis master, was impiously slain. The bishop, while making overtures of\r\npeace before the gates, next glutted the rage of the people with his\r\nblood; the fomenter of the crime, too, Leobin, was half-burnt, as he\r\nwould not quit the church till it was set on fire, and when he rushed\r\nout he was received on a thousand spears. This had been predicted by\r\nEdgitha, relict of king Edward; for when she had formerly seen Walker,\r\nwith his milk-white hair, rosy countenance, and extraordinary stature,\r\nconducted to Winchester to be consecrated; “We have here,” said she, “a\r\nnoble martyr:” being led to form such a presage by reflecting on the\r\nmutinous disposition of that people. To him succeeded William, abbat of\r\nSt. Carilef, who established monks at Durham.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the year before the king’s death, there was a mortality\r\nboth among men and cattle, and severe tempests, accompanied with such\r\nthunder and lightning, as no person before had ever seen or heard. And\r\nin the year he died, a contagious fever destroyed more than half the\r\npeople; indeed the attack of the disease killed many, and then, from\r\nthe unseasonableness of the weather, a famine following, it spread\r\nuniversally and cut off those whom the fever had spared.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his other virtues he, more especially in early youth,\r\nwas observant of chastity; insomuch that it was very commonly reported\r\nthat he was impotent. Marrying, however, at the recommendation of the\r\nnobility, he conducted himself, during many years, in such wise, as\r\nnever to be suspected of any criminal intercourse. He had many children\r\nby Matilda, whose obedience to her husband and fruitfulness in children\r\nexcited in his mind the tenderest regard for her, although there are\r\nnot wanting persons who prate about his having renounced his former\r\nchastity; and that, after he had acceded to the royal dignity, he was\r\nconnected with the daughter of a certain priest, whom the queen caused\r\nto be removed, by being hamstrung by one of her servants; on which\r\naccount he was exiled, and Matilda was scourged to death with a bridle.\r\nBut I esteem it folly to believe this of so great a king; though I\r\ndecidedly assert that a slight disagreement arose between them, in\r\nlatter times, on account of their son Robert, whom his mother was said\r\nto supply with a military force out of her revenues. Nevertheless, he\r\nproved that his conjugal affection was not in the least diminished by\r\nthis circumstance, as he buried her with great magnificence, on her\r\ndeath, four years before his own; and weeping most profusely for many\r\ndays showed how keenly he felt her loss: moreover, from that time, if\r\nwe give credit to report, he refrained from every gratification. The\r\nqueen[332] was buried at Caen, in the monastery of the Holy Trinity.\r\nThe same proof of regard was evident in the care he took of the funeral\r\nof queen Edgitha; who, placed by his attention near her husband at\r\nWestminster, has a tomb richly wrought with gold and silver.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1083.] OF KING WILLIAM’S CHILDREN.]\r\n\r\nHis sons were Robert, Richard, William, and Henry, The two last reigned\r\nafter him successively in England: Robert, irritated that Normandy\r\nwas refused him during his father’s life-time, went indignantly to\r\nItaly, that by marrying the daughter of Boniface the marquis, he might\r\nprocure assistance in those parts, to oppose the king: but failing of\r\nthis connexion, he excited Philip king of France against his father.\r\nWherefore, disappointed of his paternal blessing and inheritance, at\r\nhis death, he missed England, retaining with difficulty the duchy of\r\nNormandy: and pawning even this, at the expiration of nine years, to\r\nhis brother William, he joined the expedition into Asia, with the other\r\nChristians. From thence, at the end of four years, he returned with\r\ncredit for his military exploits; and without difficulty sat himself\r\ndown in Normandy, because his brother William being recently dead,\r\nking Henry, unsettled on account of his fresh-acquired power, deemed\r\nit enough to retain England under his command: but as I must speak of\r\nthis in another place, I will here pursue the relation I had begun\r\nconcerning the sons of William the Great.\r\n\r\nRichard afforded his noble father hopes of his future greatness; a\r\nfine youth and of aspiring disposition, considering his age: but an\r\nuntimely death quickly withered the bud of this promising flower.\r\nThey relate that while hunting deer in the New-forest, he contracted\r\na disorder from a stream of infected air. This is the place which\r\nWilliam his father, desolating the towns and destroying the churches\r\nfor more than thirty miles, had appropriated for the nurture and refuge\r\nof wild beasts;[333] a dreadful spectacle, indeed, that where before\r\nhad existed human intercourse and the worship of God, there deer, and\r\ngoats, and other animals of that kind, should now range unrestrained,\r\nand these not subjected to the general service of mankind. Hence it\r\nis truly asserted that, in this very forest, William his son, and\r\nhis grandson Richard, son of Robert, earl of Normandy, by the severe\r\njudgment of God, met their deaths, one by a wound in the breast by an\r\narrow, the other by a wound in the neck, or as some say, from being\r\nsuspended by the jaws on the branch of a tree, as his horse passed\r\nbeneath it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1087.] DAUGHTERS OF WILLIAM I.]\r\n\r\nHis daughters were five; first, Cecilia, abbess of Caen, who still\r\nsurvives: the second, Constantia, married to Alan Fergant, earl of\r\nBrittany, excited the inhabitants, by the severity of her justice, to\r\nadminister a poisonous potion to her: the third, Adela, the wife of\r\nStephen, earl of Blois, a lady celebrated for secular industry, lately\r\ntook the veil at Marcigny. The names of the two others have escaped\r\nme.[334] One of these, as we have said, was betrothed to Harold, and\r\ndied ere she was marriageable: the other was affianced, by messengers,\r\nto Alphonso, king of Gallicia, but obtained, from God, a virgin death.\r\nA hard substance, which proved the frequency of her prayers, was found\r\nupon her knees after her decease.\r\n\r\nHonouring the memory of his father, by every practicable method, in\r\nthe latter part of his life, he caused his bones, formerly interred at\r\nNicea, to be taken up by means of a person sent for that purpose, in\r\norder to convey them elsewhere; who, successfully returning, stopped\r\nin Apulia, on hearing of the death of William, and there buried this\r\nillustrious man’s remains. He treated his mother, who, before the\r\ndeath of his father, had married one Herlewin de Conteville, a man\r\nof moderate wealth, with singular indulgence as long as she lived.\r\nWilliam’s brothers, by this match, were Robert, a man of heavy,\r\nsluggish disposition, whom he made earl of Moreton; and Odo, whom,\r\nwhile he was earl, he made bishop of Bayeux; and when king, created\r\nhim earl of Kent. Being of quicker talents than the other, he was\r\ngovernor of all England, under the king, after the death of William\r\nFitz-Osberne. He had wonderful skill in accumulating treasure;\r\npossessed extreme craft in dissembling: so that, though absent, yet,\r\nstuffing the scrips of the pilgrims with letters and money, he had\r\nnearly purchased the Roman papacy from the citizens. But when, through\r\nthe rumour of his intended journey, soldiers eagerly flocked to him\r\nfrom all parts of the kingdom, the king, taking offence, threw him\r\ninto confinement; saying, that he did not seize the bishop of Bayeux,\r\nbut the earl of Kent. His partisans being intimidated by threats,\r\ndiscovered such quantities of gold, that the heap of precious metal\r\nwould surpass the belief of the present age; and, at last, many\r\nsackfuls of wrought gold were also taken out of the rivers, which he\r\nhad secretly buried in certain places. When released, at the death of\r\nhis brother, he joined Robert’s party, as he was averse to his nephew\r\nWilliam: but then too matters turning out unfavourably, he was banished\r\nEngland, and went over to his nephew and his bishopric in Normandy.\r\nAfterwards, proceeding with him on his enterprize to Jerusalem, he died\r\nat Antioch while it was besieged by the Christians.\r\n\r\nKing William kindly admitted foreigners to his friendship; bestowed\r\nhonours on them without distinction, and was attentive to almsgiving;\r\nhe gave many possessions in England to foreign churches, and scarcely\r\ndid his own munificence, or that of his nobility, leave any monastery\r\nunnoticed, more especially in Normandy, so that their poverty was\r\nmitigated by the riches of England. Thus, in his time, the monastic\r\nflock increased on every side; monasteries arose, ancient in their\r\nrule, but modern in building: but here I perceive the muttering of\r\nthose who say, it would have been better that the old should have been\r\npreserved in their original state, than that new ones should have been\r\nerected from their plunder.\r\n\r\nHe was of just stature, extraordinary corpulence, fierce countenance;\r\nhis forehead bare of hair: of such great strength of arm, that it\r\nwas often matter of surprise, that no one was able to draw his bow,\r\nwhich himself could bend when his horse was on full gallop: he was\r\nmajestic, whether sitting or standing, although the protuberance of\r\nhis belly deformed his royal person: of excellent health, so that he\r\nwas never confined with any dangerous disorder, except at the last:\r\nso given to the pleasures of the chase, that, as I have before said,\r\nejecting the inhabitants, he let a space of many miles grow desolate,\r\nthat, when at liberty from other avocations, he might there pursue\r\nhis pleasures. He gave sumptuous and splendid entertainments, at the\r\nprincipal festivals; passing, during the years he could conveniently\r\nremain in England, Christmas at Gloucester; Easter at Winchester;\r\nPentecost at Westminster. At these times a royal edict summoned thither\r\nall the principal persons of every order, that the ambassadors from\r\nforeign nations might admire the splendour of the assemblage, and the\r\ncostliness of the banquets. Nor was he at any time more affable or\r\nindulgent; in order that the visitants might proclaim universally,\r\nthat his generosity kept pace with his riches. This mode of banqueting\r\nwas constantly observed by his first successor; the second omitted it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1087.] WILLIAM’S LOVE OF MONEY.]\r\n\r\nHis anxiety for money is the only thing for which he can deservedly be\r\nblamed.[335] This he sought all opportunities of scraping together, he\r\ncared not how; he would say and do some things, and, indeed, almost any\r\nthing, unbecoming such great majesty, where the hope of money allured\r\nhim. I have here no excuse whatever to offer, unless it be, as one\r\nhas said, that, “Of necessity, he must fear many, whom many fear.”\r\nFor, through dread of his enemies, he used to drain the country of\r\nmoney, with which he might retard or repel their attacks; very often,\r\nas it happens in human affairs, where strength failed, purchasing\r\nthe forbearance of his enemies with gold. This disgraceful calamity\r\nis still prevalent, and every day increases; so that both towns\r\nand churches are subjected to contributions: nor is this done with\r\nfirm-kept faith on the part of the imposers, but whoever offers more,\r\ncarries the prize; all former agreements being disregarded.\r\n\r\nResiding in his latter days in Normandy, when enmity had arisen between\r\nhim and the king of France, he, for a short period, was confined to the\r\nhouse: Philip, scoffing at this forbearance, is reported to have said,\r\n“The king of England is lying-in at Rouen, and keeps his bed, like a\r\nwoman after her delivery;” jesting on his belly, which he had been\r\nreducing by medicine. Cruelly hurt at this sarcasm, he replied, “When\r\nI go to mass, after my confinement, I will make him an offering of a\r\nhundred thousand candles.”[336] He swore this, “by the Resurrection and\r\nGlory of God:” for he was wont purposely to swear such oaths as, by\r\nthe very form of his mouth, would strike terror into the minds of his\r\nhearers.\r\n\r\nNot long after, in the end of the month of August, when the corn was\r\nripe on the ground, the clusters on the vines, and the orchards laden\r\nwith fruit in full abundance, collecting an army, he entered France in\r\na hostile manner, trampling down, and laying every thing waste: nothing\r\ncould assuage his irritated mind, so determined was he to revenge this\r\ninjurious taunt at the expense of multitudes. At last he set fire to\r\nthe city of Mantes, where the church of St. Mary was burnt, together\r\nwith a recluse who did not think it justifiable to quit her cell even\r\nunder such an emergency; and the whole property of the citizens was\r\ndestroyed. Exhilarated by this success, while furiously commanding his\r\npeople to add fuel to the conflagration, he approached too near the\r\nflames, and contracted a disorder from the violence of the fire and\r\nthe intenseness of the autumnal heat. Some say, that his horse leaping\r\nover a dangerous ditch, ruptured his rider, where his belly projected\r\nover the front of the saddle. Injured by this accident, he sounded a\r\nretreat, and returning to Rouen, as the malady increased he took to his\r\nbed. His physicians, when consulted, affirmed, from an inspection of\r\nhis urine, that death was inevitable. On hearing this, he filled the\r\nhouse with his lamentations, because death had suddenly seized him,\r\nbefore he could effect that reformation of life which he had long since\r\nmeditated. Recovering his fortitude, however, he performed the duties\r\nof a Christian in confession and receiving the communion. Reluctantly,\r\nand by compulsion, he bestowed Normandy on Robert; to William he gave\r\nEngland; while Henry received his maternal possessions. He ordered all\r\nhis prisoners to be released and pardoned: his treasures to be brought\r\nforth, and distributed to the churches: he gave also a certain sum of\r\nmoney to repair the church which had been burnt. Thus rightly ordering\r\nall things, he departed on the eighth of the ides of September, [Sept.\r\n6,] in the fifty-ninth year of his age: the twenty-second of his reign:\r\nthe fifty-second of his duchy: and in the year of our Lord 1087.\r\nThis was the same year, in which Canute, king of Denmark, as we have\r\nbefore related, was killed; and in which the Spanish Saracens raging\r\nagainst the Christians, were shortly compelled to retire to their own\r\nterritories by Alphonso, king of Gallicia; unwillingly evacuating even\r\nthe cities they had formerly occupied.\r\n\r\nThe body, embalmed after royal custom, was brought down the river\r\nSeine to Caen, and there consigned to the earth, a large assembly of\r\nthe clergy attending, but few of the laity. Here might be seen the\r\nwretchedness of earthly vicissitude; for that man who was formerly the\r\nglory of all Europe, and more powerful than any of his predecessors,\r\ncould not find a place of everlasting rest, without contention. For\r\na certain knight, to whose patrimony the place pertained, loudly\r\nexclaiming at the robbery, forbade his burial: saying, that the\r\nground belonged to himself by paternal right; and that the king had\r\nno claim to rest in a place which he had forcibly invaded. Whereupon,\r\nat the desire of Henry, the only one of his sons who was present, a\r\nhundred pounds of silver[337] were paid to this brawler, and quieted\r\nhis audacious claim: for at that time, Robert his elder born was in\r\nFrance, carrying on a war against his own country: William had sailed\r\nfor England, ere the king had well breathed his last; thinking it more\r\nadvantageous to look to his future benefit, than to be present at the\r\nfuneral of his father. Moreover, in the dispersion of money, neither\r\nslow, nor sparing, he brought forth from its secret hoard, all that\r\ntreasure which had been accumulated at Winchester, during a reign of so\r\nmany years: to the monasteries he gave a piece of gold; to each parish\r\nchurch five shillings in silver: to every county a hundred pounds to\r\nbe divided to each poor man severally. He also very splendidly adorned\r\nthe tomb of his father, with a large mass of gold and silver and the\r\nrefulgence of precious stones.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1087.] BERENGAR OF TOURS].\r\n\r\nAt this time lived Berengar, the heresiarch of Tours, who denied, that\r\nthe bread and wine, when placed on the altar and consecrated by the\r\npriest, were, as the holy church affirms, the real and substantial\r\nbody of the Lord. Already was the whole of Gaul infected with this\r\nhis doctrine, disseminated by means of poor scholars, whom he allured\r\nby daily hire. On this account pope Leo, of holiest memory, alarmed\r\nfor the catholic faith, calling a council against him at Vercelli,\r\ndispersed the darkness of this misty error, by the effulgence of\r\nevangelical testimony. But when, after his death, the poison of heresy\r\nagain burst forth from the bosoms of some worthless people where it had\r\nlong been nurtured, Hildebrand, in councils, when he was archdeacon,\r\nat Tours, and after, when pope, at Rome, compelled him, after being\r\nconvicted, to the abjuration of his opinion; which matters, any\r\nperson desirous of seeing will find recorded in their proper place.\r\nArchbishop Lanfranc and Guimund, the most eloquent man of our times,\r\nfirst monk of St. Leofrid, in Normandy, afterwards bishop of Aversa in\r\nApulia, confuted him; but principally and most forcibly the latter.\r\nAnd, indeed, though Berengar disgraced the earlier part of his life\r\nby defending certain heresies, yet he came so much to his senses in\r\nriper age, that without hesitation, he was by some esteemed a saint;\r\nadmired for innumerable good qualities, but especially for his humility\r\nand almsgiving: showing himself master of his large possessions, by\r\ndispersing, not their slave by hoarding and worshipping them. He was\r\nso guarded with respect to female beauty, that he would never suffer a\r\nwoman to appear before him, lest he should seem to enjoy that beauty\r\nwith his eye, which he did not desire in his heart. He was used\r\nneither to despise the poor nor flatter the rich: to live by nature’s\r\nrule, “and having food and raiment,” in the language of the apostle,\r\n“therewith to be content.” In consequence, Hildebert, bishop of Mans,\r\na first-rate poet, highly commends him; whose words I have purposely\r\ninserted, that I may show this celebrated bishop’s regard to his\r\nmaster; and at the same time his opinion will serve for an example to\r\nposterity, how he thought a man ought to live: although, perhaps, from\r\nthe strength of his affection, he may have exceeded the bounds of just\r\ncommendation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1087.] PANEGYRIC ON BERENGAR.]\r\n\r\n  Fame, which the world allows his due,\r\n  Shall Berengar, when dead, pursue:\r\n  Whom, plac’d on faith’s exalted height\r\n  The fifth day ravish’d with fell spite:\r\n  Sad was that day, and fatal too,\r\n  Where grief and loss united grew,\r\n  Wherein the church’s hope and pride,\r\n  The law, with its supporter, died.\r\n  What sages taught, or poets sung\r\n  Bow’d to his wit, and honey’d tongue.\r\n  Then holier wisdom’s path he trod,\r\n  And fill’d his heart and lips with God.\r\n  His soul, his voice, his action prov’d\r\n  The great Creator’s praise he lov’d,\r\n  So good, so wise, his growing fame\r\n  Shall soar above the greatest name:\r\n  Whose rank preserv’d his honours gain’d,\r\n  Preferr’d the poor to rich: maintain’d\r\n  The sternest justice. Wealth’s wide power\r\n  Ne’er gave to sloth, or waste, an hour,\r\n  Nor could repeated honours, high,\r\n  Seduce him from humility;\r\n  Who ne’er on money set his mind,\r\n  But griev’d he could no object find\r\n  Where he might give: and help’d the poor\r\n  Till poverty assail’d his door.\r\n  His life by nature’s laws to guide,\r\n  His mind from vice, his lips from pride,\r\n  Still was his care: to false, the true\r\n  Prefer, and nothing senseless do:\r\n  Evil to none, but good impart,\r\n  And banish lucre, hand and heart.\r\n  Whose dress was coarse, and temperance just\r\n  Awaited appetite’s keen gust:\r\n  Was chastity’s perpetual guest,\r\n  Nor let rank lust disturb his rest.\r\n  When nature form’d him, “See,” said she,\r\n  “While others fade, one born for me.”\r\n  Ere justice sought her place of rest\r\n  On high, he lock’d her in his breast.\r\n  A saint from boyhood, whose great name\r\n  Surpasses his exceeding fame,\r\n  Which, though the wide world it may fill,\r\n  Shall never reach his merit still.\r\n  Pious and grave, so humble yet,\r\n  That envy ne’er could him beset;\r\n  For envy weeps, whom still before\r\n  She hated, prone now to adore;\r\n  First for his life, but now his fate\r\n  She moans, laments his frail estate.\r\n  Man truly wise and truly blest!\r\n  Thy soul and body both at rest,\r\n  May I, when dead, abide with you,\r\n  And share the self-same portion too.\r\n\r\nYou may perceive in these verses, that the bishop exceeded the just\r\nmeasure of praise; but eloquence is apt to recommend itself in such\r\nwise; thus a brilliant style proceeds in graceful strain; thus\r\n\r\n  “Bewitching eloquence sheds purple flowers.”\r\n\r\nBut though Berengar himself changed his sentiments, yet was he unable\r\nto convert all whom he had infected throughout the world; “so dreadful\r\na thing it is to seduce others from what is right, either by example\r\nor by word; as, perhaps, in consequence, you must bear the sins of\r\nothers after having atoned for your own.” Fulbert, bishop of Chartres,\r\nwhom Mary, the mother of our Lord, was seen to cure when sick, by the\r\nmilk of her breasts, is said to have predicted this; for, when lying in\r\nthe last extremity, he was visited by many persons, and the house was\r\nscarcely large enough to hold the company, he darted his eye through\r\nthe throng, and endeavoured to drive away Berengar, with all the force\r\nhe had remaining; protesting that an immense devil stood near him,\r\nand attempted to seduce many persons to follow him, by beckoning with\r\nhis hand, and whispering some enticement. Moreover, Berengar himself,\r\nwhen about to expire on the day of the Epiphany, sadly sighing, at the\r\nrecollection of the wretched people whom, when a very young man, in the\r\nheat of error, he had infected with his opinions, exclaimed, “To-day,\r\nin the day of his manifestation, my Lord Jesus Christ will appear to\r\nme, either to glorify me, as I hope, for my repentance; or to punish\r\nme, as I fear, for the heresy I have propagated on others.”\r\n\r\nWe indeed believe, that after ecclesiastical benediction, those\r\nmysteries are the very body and blood of the Saviour; induced to\r\nsuch an opinion, by the authority of the ancient church, and by many\r\nmiracles recently manifested. Such as that which St. Gregory exhibited\r\nat Rome; and such as Paschasius relates to have taken place in Germany;\r\nthat the priest Plegild visibly touched the form of a boy, upon the\r\naltar, and that after kissing him he partook of him, turned into the\r\nsimilitude of bread, after the custom of the church: which, they\r\nrelate, Berengar used arrogantly to cavil at, and to say, that “it was\r\nthe treacherous covenant of a scoundrel, to destroy with his teeth,\r\nhim whom he had kissed with his mouth.” Such, too, is that concerning\r\nthe Jewish boy, who by chance running playfully into a church, with a\r\nChristian of the same age, saw a child torn to pieces on the altar, and\r\nseverally divided to the people; which when, with childish innocence,\r\nhe related as truth to his parents, they placed him in a furnace, where\r\nthe fire was burning and the door closed: whence, after many hours, he\r\nwas snatched by the Christians, without injury to his person, clothes,\r\nor hair; and being asked how he could escape the devouring flames, he\r\nreplied, “That beautiful woman whom I saw sitting in the chair, whose\r\nson was divided among the people, always stood at my right hand in the\r\nfurnace, keeping off the threatening flames and fiery volumes with her\r\ngarments.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1087.] THE TOMB OF WALWIN.]\r\n\r\nAt that time, in a province of Wales, called Ros, was found the\r\nsepulchre of Walwin, the noble nephew of Arthur; he reigned, a most\r\nrenowned knight, in that part of Britain which is still named Walwerth;\r\nbut was driven from his kingdom by the brother and nephew of Hengist,\r\n(of whom I have spoken in my first book,) though not without first\r\nmaking them pay dearly for his expulsion. He deservedly shared, with\r\nhis uncle, the praise of retarding, for many years, the calamity of\r\nhis falling country. The sepulchre of Arthur is no where to be seen,\r\nwhence ancient ballads fable that he is still to come. But the tomb\r\nof the other, as I have suggested, was found in the time of king\r\nWilliam, on the sea-coast, fourteen feet long: there, as some relate,\r\nhe was wounded by his enemies, and suffered shipwreck; others say,\r\nhe was killed by his subjects at a public entertainment. The truth\r\nconsequently is doubtful; though neither of these men was inferior to\r\nthe reputation they have acquired.\r\n\r\nThis, too, was the period in which Germany, for fifty years, bewailed\r\nthe pitiable, and almost fatal government of Henry, of whom I have\r\nspoken in the history of William. He was neither unlearned nor\r\nindolent; but so singled out by fate for every person to attack, that\r\nwhoever took up arms against him seemed, to himself, to be acting for\r\nthe good of religion. He had two sons, Conrad and Henry: the first, not\r\nviolating the rights of nature towards his father, having subjugated\r\nItaly, died at Arezzo, a city of Tuscany: the other, in his early\r\nage, attacking his parent when he was somewhat at rest from external\r\nmolestation, compelled him to retire from the empire, and when he\r\ndied shortly after, honoured him with an imperial funeral. He still\r\nsurvives, obstinately adhering to those very sentiments, on account of\r\nwhich he thought himself justified in persecuting his father; for he\r\ngrants the investiture of churches by the staff and ring; and looks\r\nupon the pope as not legally elected without his concurrence; although\r\nCalixtus, who now presides over the papal see, has greatly restrained\r\nthis man’s inordinate ambition: but let the reader wait my farther\r\nrelation of these matters in their proper order.\r\n\r\nMoreover, pope Hildebrand dying, as I have said, and Urban being\r\nelected by the cardinals, the emperor persisted in his intention of\r\npreferring Guibert, of proclaiming him pope, and of bringing him\r\nto Rome, by the expulsion of the other. The army, however, of the\r\nmarchioness Matilda, a woman, who, forgetful of her sex, and comparable\r\nto the ancient Amazons, used to lead forth her hardy troops to\r\nbattle, espoused the juster cause, as it seemed, by her assistance,\r\nin succeeding time, Urban obtaining the papal throne, held quiet\r\npossession of it for eleven years. After him Paschal was appointed\r\nby the Romans, who held Henry’s concurrence in contempt. Guibert yet\r\nburdened the earth with his existence, the only sower of sedition, who\r\nnever, during his whole life, laid aside his obstinacy, nor conformed\r\nto justice; saying, that the decision of the emperor ought to be\r\nobserved; not that of the assassins, or parchment-mongers of Rome.[338]\r\nIn consequence, both of them being excommunicated in several councils,\r\nthey treated the sentence with ridicule. Notwithstanding these\r\ncircumstances, there were many things praiseworthy in the emperor:\r\nhe was eloquent, of great abilities, well read, actively charitable;\r\nhad many good qualities, both of mind and person: was ever prepared\r\nfor war, insomuch that he was sixty-two times engaged in battle; was\r\nequitable in adjusting differences; and when matters were unsuccessful,\r\nhe would prefer his griefs to heaven, and wait for redress from thence.\r\nMany of his enemies perished by untimely deaths.\r\n\r\nI have heard a person of the utmost veracity relate, that one of his\r\nadversaries, a weak and factious man, while reclining at a banquet,\r\nwas, on a sudden, so completely surrounded by mice, as to be unable to\r\nescape. So great was the number of these little animals, that there\r\ncould scarcely be imagined more in a whole province. It was in vain,\r\nthat they were attacked with clubs and fragments of the benches which\r\nwere at hand: and though they were for a long time assailed by all, yet\r\nthey wreaked their deputed curse on no one else; pursuing him only\r\nwith their teeth, and with a kind of dreadful squeaking. And although\r\nhe was carried out to sea about a javelin’s cast by the servants, yet\r\nhe could not by these means escape their violence; for immediately so\r\ngreat a multitude of mice took to the water, that you would have sworn\r\nthe sea was strewed with chaff. But when they began to gnaw the planks\r\nof the ship, and the water, rushing through the chinks, threatened\r\ninevitable shipwreck, the servants turned the vessel to the shore.\r\nThe animals, then also swimming close to the ship, landed first. Thus\r\nthe wretch, set on shore, and soon after entirely gnawed in pieces,\r\nsatiated the dreadful hunger of the mice.\r\n\r\nI deem this the less wonderful, because it is well known, that in Asia,\r\nif a leopard bite any person, a party of mice approach directly, to\r\ndischarge their urine on the wounded man; and that a filthy deluge\r\nof their water attends his death; but if, by the care of servants\r\ndriving them off, the destruction can be avoided during nine days;\r\nthen medical assistance, if called in, may be of service. My informant\r\nhad seen a person wounded after this manner, who, despairing of safety\r\non shore, proceeded to sea, and lay at anchor; when immediately more\r\nthan a thousand mice swam out, wonderful to relate, in the rinds of\r\npomegranates, the insides of which they had eaten; but they were\r\ndrowned through the loud shouting of the sailors. “For the Creator of\r\nall things has made nothing destitute of sagacity; nor any pest without\r\nits remedy.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1087.] OF MARIANUS SCOTUS.]\r\n\r\nDuring this emperor’s reign flourished Marianus Scotus,[339] first a\r\nmonk of Fulda, afterwards a recluse at Mentz, who, by renouncing the\r\npresent life, secured the happiness of that which is to come. During\r\nhis long continued leisure, he examined the writers on Chronology, and\r\ndiscovered the disagreement of the cycles of Dionysius the Little with\r\nthe evangelical computation. Wherefore reckoning every year from the\r\nbeginning of the world, he added twenty-two, which were wanting, to the\r\nabove mentioned cycles; but he had few, or no followers of his opinion.\r\nWherefore I am often led to wonder, why such unhappiness should attach\r\nto the learned of our time, that in so great a number of scholars and\r\nstudents, pale with watching, scarcely one can obtain unqualified\r\ncommendation for knowledge. So much does ancient custom please, and so\r\nlittle encouragement, though deserved, is given to new discoveries,\r\nhowever consistent with truth. All are anxious to grovel in the old\r\ntrack, and everything modern is contemned; and therefore, as patronage\r\nalone can foster genius, when that is withheld, every exertion\r\nlanguishes.\r\n\r\nBut as I have mentioned the monastery of Fulda, I will relate what a\r\nreverend man, Walker, prior of Malvern, whose words if any disbelieve\r\nhe offends against holiness, told me had happened there. “Not more\r\nthan fifteen years have elapsed,” said he, “since a contagious disease\r\nattacked the abbat of that place, and afterwards destroyed many of\r\nthe monks. The survivors, at first, began each to fear for himself,\r\nand to pray, and give alms more abundantly than usual. In process of\r\ntime, however, for such is the nature of man, their fear gradually\r\nsubsiding, they began to omit them; the cellarer more especially: who\r\npublicly and absurdly exclaimed, that the stock of provision was not\r\nadequate to such a consumption; that he had lately hoped for some\r\nreduction of expense from so many funerals, but that his hopes were at\r\nan end, if the dead consumed what the living could not. It happened\r\non a certain night, when, from some urgent business, he had deferred\r\ngoing to rest for a long time, that having at length despatched every\r\nconcern, he went towards the dormitory. And now you shall hear a\r\nstrange circumstance: he saw in the chapter-house, the abbat, and all\r\nwho had died that year, sitting in the order they had departed: when\r\naffrighted and endeavouring to escape, he was detained by force. Being\r\nreproved and corrected, after the monastic manner, with a scourge, he\r\nheard the abbat speak precisely to the following effect: that it was\r\nfoolish to look for advantage by another’s death, when all were subject\r\nto one common fate; that it was an impious thing, that a monk who had\r\npassed his whole life in the service of the church should be grudged\r\nthe pittance of a single year after his death; that he himself should\r\ndie very shortly, but that whatever others might do for him, should\r\nredound only to the advantage of those whom he had defrauded; that he\r\nmight now go and correct, by his example, those whom he had corrupted\r\nby his expressions.” He departed, and demonstrated that he had seen\r\nnothing imaginary, as well by his recent stripes, as by his death,\r\nwhich shortly followed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1087.] CANTERBURY AND YORK.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, while employed on other subjects, both matter and\r\ninclination have occurred for the relation of what was determined in\r\nWilliam’s time, concerning the controversy still existing between the\r\narchbishops of Canterbury and York. And that posterity may be fully\r\ninformed of this business, I will subjoin the opinions of the ancient\r\nfathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pope Gregory to Augustine, first archbishop of Canterbury._\r\n\r\n“Let your jurisdiction not only extend over the bishops you shall have\r\nordained, or such as have been ordained by the bishop of York, but also\r\nover all the priests of Britain, by the authority of our Lord Jesus\r\nChrist.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boniface to Justus, archbishop of Canterbury._\r\n\r\n“Far be it from every Christian, that anything concerning the city\r\nof Canterbury be diminished or changed, in present or future times,\r\nwhich was appointed by our predecessor pope Gregory, however human\r\ncircumstances may be changed: but more especially, by the authority\r\nof St. Peter the prince of apostles, we command and ordain, that the\r\ncity of Canterbury shall ever hereafter be esteemed the metropolitan\r\nsee of all Britain; and we decree and appoint, immutably, that all\r\nthe provinces of the kingdom of England shall be subject to the\r\nmetropolitan church of the aforesaid see. And if any one attempt to\r\ninjure this church, which is more especially under the power and\r\nprotection of the holy Roman church, or to lessen the jurisdiction\r\nconceded to it, may God expunge him from the book of life; and let him\r\nknow, that he is bound by the sentence of a curse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alexander to William, king of England._\r\n\r\n“The cause of Alric, formerly called bishop of Chichester, we have\r\nentrusted to our brother bishop, Lanfranc, to be by him diligently\r\nreconsidered and determined. We have also commended to him the labour\r\nof deciding the dispute which has arisen between the archbishop of\r\nYork, and the bishop of Dorchester, on matters belonging to their\r\ndioceses; strictly ordering him to examine this cause most diligently\r\nand bring it to a just termination. Besides, we have so fully\r\ncommitted to him the authority of our personal and pontifical power in\r\nconsidering and settling causes, that whatever he shall, according to\r\njustice, have determined, shall be regarded as firm and indissoluble\r\nhereafter, as though it had been adjudged in our presence.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1072] CANTERBURY AND YORK.]\r\n\r\n“In the year of our Lord Jesus Christ’s incarnation 1072, of the\r\npontificate of pope Alexander the eleventh, and of the reign of\r\nWilliam, glorious king of England, and duke of Normandy, the sixth;\r\nby the command of the said pope Alexander, and permission of the\r\nsame king, in presence of himself, his bishops, and abbats, the\r\nquestion was agitated concerning the primacy which Lanfranc,[340]\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, claimed in right of his church, over that\r\nof York; and concerning the ordination of certain bishops, of which\r\nit was not clearly evident, to whom they especially pertained; and\r\nat length, after some time it was proved and shown by the distinct\r\nauthority of various writings, that the church of York ought to be\r\nsubject to that of Canterbury, and to be obedient to the appointments\r\nof its archbishop, as primate of all England, in all such matters as\r\npertained to the Christian religion. But the homage of the bishop\r\nof Durham, that is of Lindisfarne, and of all the countries beyond\r\nthe limits of the bishop of Lichfield, and the great river Humber,\r\nto the farthest boundaries of Scotland, and whatever on this side of\r\nthe aforesaid river justly pertains to the diocese of the church of\r\nYork, the metropolitan of Canterbury allowed for ever to belong to\r\nthe archbishop of York and his successors: in such sort, that if the\r\narchbishop of Canterbury chose to call a council, wherever he deemed\r\nfit, the archbishop of York was bound to be present at his command,\r\nwith all his suffragan bishops, and be obedient to his canonical\r\ninjunctions. And Lanfranc the archbishop proved from the ancient custom\r\nof his predecessors, that the archbishop of York was bound to make\r\nprofession, even with an oath, to the archbishop of Canterbury; but\r\nthrough regard to the king, he dispensed with the oath from Thomas,\r\narchbishop of York; and received his written profession only: but not\r\nforming a precedent for his successors who might choose to exact the\r\noath, together with the profession, from Thomas’s successors. If the\r\narchbishop of Canterbury should die, the archbishop of York shall come\r\nto Canterbury; and, with the other bishops of the church aforesaid,\r\nduly consecrate the person elect as his lawful primate. But if the\r\narchbishop of York shall die, his successor, accepting the gift of the\r\narchbishopric from the king, shall come to Canterbury, or where the\r\narchbishop of Canterbury shall appoint, and shall from him receive\r\ncanonical ordination. To this ordinance consented the king aforesaid,\r\nand the archbishops, Lanfranc of Canterbury, and Thomas of York; and\r\nHubert subdeacon of the holy Roman church, and legate of the aforesaid\r\npope Alexander; and the other bishops and abbats present. This cause\r\nwas first agitated at the festival of Easter in the city of Winchester,\r\nin the royal chapel, situated in the castle; afterwards in the royal\r\ntown called Windsor, where it received its termination, in the presence\r\nof the king, the bishops, and abbats of different orders, who were\r\nassembled at the king’s court on the festival of Pentecost.\r\n\r\n“The signature of William the king: the signature of Matilda the queen.\r\n\r\n“I Hubert, subdeacon of the holy Roman church, and legate from pope\r\nAlexander, have signed.\r\n\r\n“I Lanfranc, archbishop of Canterbury, have signed.\r\n\r\n“I Thomas, archbishop of York, have signed.\r\n\r\n“I William, bishop of London, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Herman, bishop of Sherborne, have signed.\r\n\r\n“I Wulstan, bishop of Worcester, have signed.\r\n\r\n“I Walter, bishop of Hereford, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Giso, bishop of Wells, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Remigius, bishop of Dorchester, have signed.\r\n\r\n“I Walkelin, bishop of Winchester, have signed.\r\n\r\n“I Herefast, bishop of Helmham, have signed.\r\n\r\n“I Stigand, bishop of Chichester, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Siward, bishop of Rochester, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Osberne, bishop of Exeter, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Odo, bishop of Bayeux and earl of Kent, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Gosfrith, bishop of Coutances and one of the nobles of England, have\r\nassented.\r\n\r\n“I Scotland, abbat of St. Augustine’s monastery, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Thurstan, abbat of the monastery which is situated in the isle of\r\nEly, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Ailnoth, abbat of Glastonbury, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Elfwin, abbat of the monastery of Ramsey, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Wulnoth, abbat of Chertsey, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Ailwyn, abbat of Evesham, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Frederic, abbat of St. Alban’s, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Goffrid, abbat of the monastery of St. Peter, near London, have\r\nassented.\r\n\r\n“I Baldwin, abbat of St. Edmund’s monastery, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Turald, abbat of Burgh, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Adelelm, abbat of Abingdon, have assented.\r\n\r\n“I Ruald, abbat of the New minster at Winchester, have assented.\r\n\r\n“It becomes every Christian to be subject to Christian laws, and by\r\nno means to run counter to those things which have been wholesomely\r\nenacted by the holy fathers.

Of this matter\r\nI was doubtful, while I was yet about to be ordained by you: wherefore\r\nI promised obedience unconditionally to you, but conditionally to your\r\nsuccessors.”\r\n\r\nThe archbishop of Canterbury, as I remember to have observed in my\r\nfirst book, originally had subject to him, these bishops: London,\r\nWinchester, Rochester, Sherborne, Worcester, Hereford, Lichfield,\r\nSelsey, Leicester, Helmham, Sidnacester, Dunwich; in the time of king\r\nEdward the Elder were added, Cornwall, Crediton, Wells in West Saxony,\r\nand Dorchester in Mercia, as I noticed in my second book.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1072.] PRIVILEGES OF THE ARCHBISHOP OF YORK.]\r\n\r\nThe archbishop of York had all the bishops on the farther side of the\r\nHumber subject to him, as Ripon, Hexham, Lindisfarne, Candida Casa,\r\nwhich is now called Whitherne; and all the bishops of Scotland and\r\nthe Orkneys; as the archbishop of Canterbury had those of Ireland and\r\nWales. The bishoprics of Ripon and Hexham have long since perished by\r\nhostile ravages; Leicester, Sidnacester, and Dunwich, by means that\r\nI cannot account for; and, in the time of king Edward the Simple,\r\nCornwall and Crediton were united, and the bishopric translated to\r\nExeter. In king William’s time, at this council, it was determined\r\nthat, according to the decrees of the canons, the bishops should quit\r\nthe villages, and fix their abode in the cities of their dioceses;\r\nLichfield therefore migrated to Chester, which was anciently called the\r\nCity of Legions; Selsey to Chichester; Helmham first to Thetford, and\r\nnow, by bishop Herbert, to Norwich; Sherborne to Salisbury; Dorchester\r\nto Lincoln. For Lindisfarne had long before passed to Durham, and\r\nlately Wells to Bath.\r\n\r\nIn this assembly Lanfranc, who was yet uninstructed in English matters,\r\ninquired of the elder bishops, what was the order of sitting in\r\ncouncil, as originally appointed. They, alleging the difficulty of the\r\nquestion, deferred their answer till the next day; when, carefully\r\ncalling circumstances to mind, they asserted that they had seen the\r\narrangement as follows: that the archbishop of Canterbury, presiding at\r\nthe council, should have, on the right hand, the archbishop of York,\r\nand next him the bishop of Winchester; and on his left, the bishop of\r\nLondon. But should it ever happen, through necessity, that the primate\r\nof Canterbury should be absent, or should he be dead, the archbishop of\r\nYork, presiding at the council, should have the bishops of London on\r\nhis right hand, and of Winchester on his left; and the rest should take\r\ntheir seats according to the time of their ordination.\r\n\r\nAt that time, too, the claim of the archbishop of York on the see of\r\nWorcester and Dorchester was decided and set at rest. For he said that\r\nthey ought to be subject to his jurisdiction; which, after having\r\npondered for some time in secret, when he proceeded to Rome with\r\nLanfranc to receive their palls from the pope, he brought publicly\r\nbefore the Roman court. Lanfranc, though for the most part unmoved by\r\ninjury, could not help betraying, by his countenance, his emotion at\r\nsuch a wanton and unheard-of attack, though he for some time refrained\r\nfrom speaking. But pope Alexander, who felt much for Lanfranc’s\r\ndistress, for he had even condescendingly risen from his seat when\r\nhe approached, professing that he paid him this mark of respect, not\r\nfrom honour to the archbishop but regard to his learning, removed from\r\nhimself the unpleasant task of deciding, and referred the adjudication\r\nof it to an English council. In consequence, as I have related, the\r\nmatter, after deep investigation, came to this termination in the\r\npresent council; that, as these bishops were on this side of the\r\nHumber, they should belong to Canterbury, but all beyond that river to\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nHere the pious simplicity of St. Wulstan, bishop of Worcester, and\r\nhis noble confidence in God, demand praise and approbation. For when\r\ncalled in question as well concerning this business, as on his slender\r\nattainments in learning, he had retired to consider more carefully\r\nwhat answer he should make, his mind undisturbed by tumult: “Believe\r\nme,” said he, “we have not yet sung the service for the sixth hour:\r\nlet us sing the service therefore.” And, on his companions suggesting\r\nthe necessity of first expediting the business they had met upon; that\r\nthere was ample time for singing, and that the king and the nobility\r\nwould laugh at them, if they heard of it: “Truly,” said he, “let us\r\nfirst do our duty towards God, and afterwards settle the disputes\r\nof men.” Having sung the service, he directly proceeded towards the\r\ncouncil-chamber, without devising any subterfuge, or any attempt to\r\ndisguise the truth. To his dependents, who were desirous of withholding\r\nhim, and who could not be persuaded but their cause was in danger,\r\nhe said, “Know for certain, that I here visibly perceive those holy\r\narchbishops, Dunstan of Canterbury, and Oswald of York; who, defending\r\nme this day with their prayers, will darken the understandings of my\r\ngainsayers.” Then giving his benediction to a monk, a man of little\r\neloquence, but somewhat acquainted with the Norman language, on summing\r\nup his cause, he obtained that he, who was before thought unworthy\r\nof the management of his own diocese, should be humbly entreated by\r\nthe archbishop of York, to condescend to visit those parts of his\r\nprovince, which himself, through dread of enemies, or ignorance of the\r\nlanguage, had refrained from approaching. But I will no longer torture\r\nthe patience of my readers, who perhaps do not regard this matter\r\nwith pleasure, as they are in expectation of the history of William’s\r\nsuccessors; though, if I am not too partial to myself, a variety of\r\nanecdote can be displeasing to no one, unless he be morose enough to\r\nrival the superciliousness of Cato. But whoever is so inclined, will\r\nfind such other matters in the fourth and fifth book, for here the\r\nthird shall terminate.[341]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1072.] PREFACE TO BOOK IV.]\r\n\r\nI am aware, that many persons think it unwise in me, to have written\r\nthe history of the kings of my own time; alleging, that in such a\r\nwork, truth is often made shipwreck of, while falsehood meets with\r\nsupport: because to relate the crimes of contemporaries, is attended\r\nwith danger; their good actions with applause. Whence it arises, say\r\nthey, that, as all things have, now, a natural tendency to evil rather\r\nthan to good, the historian passes over any disgraceful transaction,\r\nhowever obvious, through timidity; and, for the sake of approbation,\r\nfeigns good qualities, when he cannot find them. There are others,\r\nwho, judging of us by their own indolence, deem us unequal to so great\r\na task, and brand our undertaking with malignant censure. Wherefore,\r\nimpelled by the reasoning of the one, or the contempt of the other,\r\nI had long since voluntarily retired to leisure and to silence: but,\r\nafter indulging in them for a time, the accustomed inclination for\r\nstudy again strongly beset me; as it was impossible for me to be\r\nunoccupied, and I knew not how to give myself up to those forensic\r\navocations, which are beneath the notice of a literary character.\r\nTo this was to be added the incitements of my friends, to whose\r\nsuggestions, though only implied, I ought to pay regard: and they\r\nindeed gently urged me, already sufficiently disposed, to prosecute\r\nmy undertaking. Animated, therefore, by the advice of those whom I\r\nlove most affectionately, I advance to give them a lasting pledge of\r\nfriendship from the stores of my research. Grateful also to those who\r\nare in fear for me, lest I should either excite hatred, or disguise\r\nthe truth, I will, by the help of Christ, make such a return for their\r\nkindness, as neither to become odious, nor a falsifier. For I will\r\ndescribe, both what has been done well, or otherwise, in such wise, and\r\nso safely steer between Scylla and Charybdis, that my opinions shall\r\nnot be concealed, though some matters may be omitted in my history.\r\nMoreover, to those who undervalue the labours of others, I make the\r\nsame answer as St. Jerome formerly did to his critics; “Let them read\r\nif they like: if not, let them cast it aside; because I do not obtrude\r\nmy work on the fastidious, but I dedicate it, if any think it worth\r\ntheir notice, to the studious;” which even these men will readily\r\npronounce to be consonant to equity, unless they are of the number of\r\nthose, of whom it is said; “Fools are easy to confute, but not so easy\r\nto restrain.” I will relate, then, in this, the fourth book of my work,\r\nevery thing which may be said of William, son of William the Great, in\r\nsuch manner that neither shall the truth suffer, nor shall the dignity\r\nof the prince be obscured. Some matters also will be inserted in these\r\npages, which in his time were calamitous in this country, or glorious\r\nelsewhere, as far as my knowledge extends. More especially, the\r\npilgrimage of the Christians to Jerusalem, which it will be proper to\r\nannex in this place; because an expedition, so famous in these times,\r\nis well worth hearing, and will also be an incitement to valour. Not\r\nindeed that I have any confidence these transactions will be better\r\ntreated by me than by others who have written on the subject, but that,\r\nwhat many write, many may read. Yet, lest so long a preface should\r\ndisgust my reader, I will immediately enter on my work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\n_Of William the Second._ [A.D. 1087-1100.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1087.] BIRTH OF WILLIAM II.]\r\n\r\nWilliam then, the son of William, was born in Normandy many years\r\nbefore his father came to England; and being educated with extreme care\r\nby his parents, as he had naturally an ambitious mind, he at length\r\nreached the summit of dignity. He would no doubt have been a prince\r\nincomparable in our time, had not his father’s greatness eclipsed him;\r\nand had not the fates cut short his years too early for his maturer\r\nage to correct errors, contracted by the licentiousness of power, and\r\nthe impetuosity of youth. When childhood was passed, he spent the\r\nperiod of youth in military occupations; in riding, throwing the dart,\r\ncontending with his elders in obedience, with those of his own age in\r\naction: and he esteemed it injurious to his reputation, if he was not\r\nthe foremost to take arms in military commotions; unless he was the\r\nfirst to challenge the adversary, or when challenged, to overcome him.\r\nTo his father he was ever dutiful; always exerting himself in his sight\r\nin battle, ever at his side in peace. His hopes gradually expanding,\r\nhe already aspired after the succession, especially on the rejection\r\nof his elder brother, while the tender age of the younger gave him no\r\nuneasiness. Thus, adopted as his successor by his father during his\r\nlast illness, he set out to take possession of the kingdom ere the\r\nking had breathed his last: where being gladly received by the people,\r\nand obtaining the keys of the treasury, he by these means subjected\r\nall England to his will. Archbishop Lanfranc, the grand mover of\r\nevery thing, had educated him, and made him a knight,[342] and now he\r\nfavoured his pretensions to the throne; by his authority and assistance\r\nWilliam was crowned on the day of the saints Cosmas and Damian,[343]\r\nand passed the remainder of the winter quietly and with general favour.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of this period, in the beginning of spring, his\r\nfirst contention was with his uncle, Odo, bishop of Bayeux. For when\r\nOdo, on his release from confinement, as I have related, had firmly\r\nestablished his nephew, Robert, in the duchy of Normandy, he came to\r\nEngland, and received from the king the earldom of Kent. But when he\r\nsaw every thing in the kingdom managed, not at his own pleasure, as\r\nformerly, for the administration of public affairs was now committed\r\nto William, bishop of Durham, he was moved with envy, and having\r\nrevolted from the king, he tainted many others by insinuating, that the\r\nkingdom belonged to Robert, who was of gentler disposition, and whose\r\nyouthful follies had been corrected by many adversities; that William,\r\ndelicately brought up, and overbearing from that ferocity of mind which\r\nwas manifest in his countenance, would dare every thing, in defiance of\r\nright and equity: that it must soon come to pass, that they would lose\r\nthe honours they had already obtained with so much difficulty: that\r\nnothing was gained by the father’s death, if those whom he had cast\r\ninto prison, were to be killed by the son. To this effect he used, at\r\nfirst, secretly to mutter, together with Roger Montgomery, Gosfrith,\r\nbishop of Coutances, with his nephew Robert earl of Northumberland, and\r\nothers; afterwards they were more open in their clamours, repeating\r\nand disseminating them by letters and by emissaries. Moreover, even\r\nWilliam, bishop of Durham, the confidential minister of the king, had\r\njoined in their treachery. This was matter of great concern to William,\r\nit is said; because, together with the breach of friendship, he was\r\ndisappointed of the resources of the distant provinces. Odo now carried\r\noff booty of every kind to Rochester, plundering the king’s revenues\r\nin Kent, and especially the lands of the archbishop; breathing eternal\r\nhatred against him, because, he said, it was by his advice, that his\r\nbrother had cast him into chains. Nor was this assertion false: for\r\nwhen William the elder formerly complained to Lanfranc, that he was\r\ndeserted by his brother: “Seize, and cast him into chains,” said he.\r\n“What!” replied the king, “he is a clergyman!” Then the archbishop with\r\nplayful archness, as Persius says, “balancing the objection with nice\r\nantithesis,”[344] rejoined, “you will not seize the bishop of Bayeux,\r\nbut confine the earl of Kent.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1088.] CONSPIRACY OF THE NOBLES.]\r\n\r\nBishop Gosfrith with his nephew, depopulating Bath, and Berkeley, and\r\npart of the county of Wilts, treasured up their spoils at Bristol.\r\nRoger Montgomery sending out his army with the Welsh from Shrewsbury,\r\nplundered Worcestershire. They had now hostilely approached Worcester,\r\nwhen the king’s soldiers who guarded it, relying on the blessing of\r\nbishop Wulstan, to whom the custody of the castle was committed, though\r\nfew in number, dispersed this multitude; and after wounding and killing\r\nmany, took some of them prisoners. Moreover, Roger Bigod at Norwich,\r\nand Hugo de Grentmeisnil at Leicester, each with their party, were\r\nplundering in their respective neighbourhoods. In vain, however, did\r\nthe whole power of revolt rage against a man, who was deficient neither\r\nin prudence nor in good fortune. For seeing almost all the Normans\r\nleagued in one furious conspiracy, he sent alluring letters, summoning\r\nto him such brave and honest English as yet remained; and complaining\r\nto them on the subject of his wrongs, he bound them to his party, by\r\npromising them wholesome laws, a diminution of tribute, and free leave\r\nto hunt.[345] With equal cunning he circumvented Roger Montgomery, when\r\nriding with him, with dissembled perfidy; for taking him aside, he\r\nloaded him with odium, saying, that he would willingly retire from the\r\ngovernment, if it seemed meet to him and to the rest whom his father\r\nhad left as his guardians; that he could not understand, why they were\r\nso outrageous; if they wanted money, they might have what they pleased;\r\nif an increase of their estates, they might have that also; in short,\r\nthey might have whatever they chose; only let them be careful that the\r\njudgment of his father was not called in question: for, if they thought\r\nit ought to be disregarded in the instance of himself, it might be a\r\nbad example for them: for the same person made him king, who had made\r\nthem earls. Excited by these words and promises, the earl, who, next to\r\nOdo, had been the chief leader of the faction, was the first to desert.\r\nProceeding, therefore, immediately against the rebels, he laid siege\r\nto the castles of his uncle at Tunbridge and at Pevensey, and seizing\r\nhim in the latter compelled him to swear, as he dictated, that he would\r\ndepart England, and deliver up Rochester. To fulfil this promise he\r\nsent him forward with a party he could rely on, intending to follow\r\nat his leisure. At that time almost all the young nobility of England\r\nand Normandy were at Rochester: three sons of earl Roger, Eustace the\r\nyounger of Boulogne, and many others not deserving notice. The royal\r\nparty, accompanying the bishop, were few and unarmed, for who could\r\nfear treachery where he was present? and going round the walls, they\r\ncalled the townsmen to open the gates; for so the bishop in person, and\r\nthe absent king commanded. Observing from the wall, however, that the\r\ncountenance of the bishop ill agreed with the language of the speakers,\r\nthey suddenly sallied out, took horse in an instant, and carried off,\r\ntogether with the bishop, the whole party, captive. The report of this\r\ntransaction quickly reached the king. Fierce from the injury, and\r\nsmothering his indignation, he calls together his faithful English\r\nsubjects, and orders them to summon all their countrymen to the siege,\r\nunless any wished to be branded with the name of “Nidering,”[346] which\r\nimplies “abandoned.” The English who thought nothing more disgraceful\r\nthan to be stigmatised by such an appellation, flocked in troops to\r\nthe king, and rendered his army invincible. Nor could the townsmen\r\nlonger delay submission; experiencing, that a party, however noble,\r\nor however numerous, could avail nothing against the king of England.\r\nOdo, now taken a second time, abjured England for ever: the bishop of\r\nDurham of his own accord retired beyond sea, the king allowing him to\r\nescape uninjured out of regard to his former friendship: the rest were\r\nall admitted to fealty. During the interval of this siege, some of the\r\nking’s fleet destroyed a party which the earl of Normandy had sent to\r\nassist the traitors, partly by slaughter, and partly by shipwreck; the\r\nremainder, intent on escaping, endeavoured to make sail; but being soon\r\nafter disappointed by its falling calm, they became matter for laughter\r\nto our people, but their own destruction; for, that they might not be\r\ntaken alive, they leaped from their vessels into the sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1088.] TREATY WITH ROBERT.]\r\n\r\nThe next year, as the sense of injuries ever grows keener from\r\nreconsideration, the king began carefully to examine, how he might\r\nrevenge his griefs, and repay his brother for this insult. In\r\nconsequence, by his practices, he bribed the garrison, and obtained\r\npossession of the castle of St. Vallery, the adjoining port, and the\r\ntown which is called Albemarle. The earl had not the courage to resist,\r\nbut, by means of ambassadors, acquainted his lord, the king of France,\r\nwith the violence of his brother, and begged his assistance. The French\r\nking, inactive, and surfeited with daily gluttony, came hiccupping,\r\nthrough repletion, to the war: but, as he was making great professions,\r\nthe money of the king of England met him by the way; with which his\r\nresolution being borne down, he unbuckled his armour, and went back to\r\nhis gormandizing. In this manner, Normandy, for a long time, groaned\r\nunder intestine war, sometimes one party, sometimes the other being\r\nvictorious: the nobility, men of fickle temper, and faithful to neither\r\nbrother, exciting their mutual fury. A few, better advised, attentive\r\nto their own advantage, for they had possessions in both countries,\r\nwere mediators of a peace: the basis of which was, that the king\r\nshould get possession of Maine for the earl; and the earl should cede\r\nto the king those castles which he already held, and the monastery of\r\nFeschamp. The treaty was ratified and confirmed by the oath of the\r\nnobles on both sides.\r\n\r\nNot long after the king went abroad to execute these conditions. Each\r\nleader made great efforts to invade Maine; but when they had completed\r\ntheir preparations, and were just ready to proceed, an obstacle arose,\r\nthrough the spirit of Henry, the younger brother, loudly remonstrating\r\nagainst their covetousness, which had shared their paternal possessions\r\nbetween themselves, and blushed not at having left him almost\r\ndestitute. In consequence he took possession of Mount St. Michael, and\r\nharassed, with constant sallies, the besieging forces of his brothers.\r\nDuring this siege, a noble specimen of disposition was exhibited,\r\nboth by the king and by the earl: of compassion in the one, and of\r\nmagnanimity in the other. I shall subjoin these instances, for the\r\ninformation of my readers.\r\n\r\nThe king, going out of his tent, and observing the enemy at a distance,\r\nproudly prancing, rushed unattended against a large party; spurred\r\non by the impetuosity of his courage, and at the same time confident\r\nthat none would dare resist him. Presently his horse, which he had\r\nthat day purchased for fifteen marks of silver, being killed under\r\nhim, he was thrown down, and for a long time dragged by his foot; the\r\nstrength of his mail, however, prevented his being hurt. The soldier\r\nwho had unhorsed him, was at this instant drawing his sword to strike\r\nhim, when, terrified at the extremity of his danger, he cried out,\r\n“Hold, rascal, I am the king of England.” The whole troop trembled at\r\nthe well-known voice of the prostrate monarch, and immediately raised\r\nhim respectfully from the ground, and brought him another horse.\r\nLeaping into the saddle without waiting assistance, and darting a keen\r\nlook on the by-standers: “Who unhorsed me?” said he. While the rest\r\nwere silent through fear, the bold perpetrator of the deed readily\r\ndefended himself, saying, “’Twas I, who took you, not for a king, but\r\nfor a soldier.” The king, soothed, and regaining the serenity of his\r\ncountenance, exclaimed, “By the crucifix[347] at Lucca,” for such was\r\nhis oath, “henceforth thou shalt be mine, and, placed on my roll,\r\nshalt receive the recompence of this gallant service.” Nobly done,\r\nmagnanimous king! what encomium shall I pass on this speech! Equal to\r\nAlexander the Great in glory; who, through admiration of his courage,\r\npreserved, unhurt, a Persian soldier, who had attempted to strike him\r\nfrom behind, but was frustrated in his design by the treachery of his\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nBut now to relate the compassion of the earl. When the blockade had\r\nso far proceeded that the besieged were in want of water, Henry sent\r\nmessengers to Robert, to expostulate with him on the thirst he endured,\r\nand to represent, that it was impious to deprive him of water, the\r\ncommon right of mankind: let him try his courage another way if he\r\nchose; and not employ the violence of the elements, but the valour of\r\na soldier. On which, wrought upon by the natural tenderness of his\r\ndisposition, he ordered his party to be more remiss in their duty where\r\nthey kept guard, that his thirsty brother might not be deprived of\r\nwater. This circumstance, when related to the king, who was always\r\ninclined to warmth of temper, made him say to the earl, “You well know\r\nhow to carry on war indeed, who allow your enemies plenty of water: and\r\npray, how shall we subdue them, if we indulge them in food and drink?”\r\nBut he smiling, uttered this kind and truly laudable expression, “Oh,\r\nshame! should I suffer my brother to die with thirst? and where shall\r\nwe find another, if we lose him?” On this the king, deriding the mild\r\ntemper of the man, put an end to the war without accomplishing his\r\ndesign; and as the commotions of the Scots and Welsh required his\r\npresence, he retired with both his brothers to his kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1091.] EXPEDITION AGAINST SCOTLAND.]\r\n\r\nImmediately he led an expedition, first against the Welsh, and then\r\nagainst the Scots, in which he performed nothing worthy of his\r\ngreatness; but lost many of his soldiers, and had his sumpter-horses\r\nintercepted. And, not only at that time, but frequently, in Wales, was\r\nfortune unfavourable to him; which may seem strange to any one, when\r\nthe chance of war was generally on his side in other places. But it\r\nappears to me that the unevenness of the country, and the badness of\r\nthe weather, as it assisted their rebellion, was also an impediment\r\nto his valour. But king Henry, who now reigns, a man of excellent\r\ntalents, discovered a mode of counteracting their designs: which\r\nwas, by stationing in their country the Flemings, to be a barrier to\r\nthem, and constantly keep them within bounds. At that time, by the\r\nindustry of earl Robert, who had long since gained the good graces of\r\nthe Scot, the basis of a peace was laid between Malcolm and William.\r\nBut various grounds of difference still existing on both sides, and\r\njustice wavering through their mutual animosity, Malcolm came of his\r\nown accord to Gloucester, a hearty solicitor for peace, so that it\r\nwere on equitable conditions. He obtained, however, nothing more than\r\npermission to return uninjured to his kingdom: for the king disdained\r\nto take a man by subtlety, whom he might have conquered by arms. But\r\nthe next winter he was dispatched by the party of Robert, earl of\r\nNorthumberland, rather through stratagem than force. When his wife,\r\nMargaret, a woman distinguished for almsgiving and for chastity, heard\r\nof his death, disgusted with the continuance of life, she earnestly\r\nentreated of God to die. They were both remarkable for piety, but the\r\nqueen more especially. For during her whole life, wherever she might\r\nbe, she had twenty-four poor persons whom she supplied with meat and\r\nclothing. In Lent, waiting for the singing of the priests, she used to\r\nwatch all night in the church, herself assisting at triple matins, of\r\nthe Trinity, of the Cross, of St. Mary, and afterwards repeating the\r\nPsalter; with tears bedewing her garments, and agitating her breast.\r\nDeparting from the church, she used to feed the poor; first three, then\r\nnine, then twenty-four, at last three hundred: herself standing by\r\nwith the king, and pouring water on their hands. Edgar his son, when\r\nexpelled by his uncle, was restored by William; assuredly with a noble\r\ncompassion, and worthy of so great a personage, who, forgetting the\r\ninjuries of the father, replaced the son, when suppliant, on his throne.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1093.] CHARACTER OF WILLIAM II.]\r\n\r\nGreatness of soul was pre-eminent in the king, which, in process of\r\ntime, he obscured by excessive severity; vices, indeed, in place\r\nof virtues, so insensibly crept into his bosom, that he could not\r\ndistinguish them. The world doubted, for a long time, whither he would\r\nincline; what tendency his disposition would take. At first, as long\r\nas archbishop Lanfranc survived, he abstained from every crime; so\r\nthat it might be hoped, he would be the very mirror of kings. After\r\nhis death, for a time, he showed himself so variable, that the balance\r\nhung even betwixt vices and virtues. At last, however, in his latter\r\nyears, the desire after good grew cold, and the crop of evil increased\r\nto ripeness: his liberality became prodigality; his magnanimity pride;\r\nhis austerity cruelty. I may be allowed, with permission of the royal\r\nmajesty, not to conceal the truth; for he feared God but little, man\r\nnot at all. If any one shall say this is undiscerning, he will not\r\nbe wrong; because wise men should observe this rule, “God ought to\r\nbe feared at all times; man, according to circumstances.” He was,\r\nwhen abroad, and in public assemblies, of supercilious look, darting\r\nhis threatening eye on the by-stander; and with assumed severity\r\nand ferocious voice, assailing such as conversed with him. From\r\napprehension of poverty, and of the treachery of others, as may be\r\nconjectured, he was too much given to lucre, and to cruelty. At home\r\nand at table, with his intimate companions, he gave loose to levity\r\nand to mirth. He was a most facetious railer at any thing he had\r\nhimself done amiss, in order that he might thus do away obloquy, and\r\nmake it matter of jest. But I shall dilate somewhat on that liberality,\r\nin which he deceived himself; and afterwards on his other propensities,\r\nthat I may manifest what great vices sprang up in him under the\r\nsemblance of virtues.\r\n\r\nFor, in fact, there are two kinds of givers: the one is denominated\r\nprodigal, the other liberal. The prodigal are such as lavish their\r\nmoney on those things, of which they will leave either a transient,\r\nor perhaps no memory in this world; neither will they gain mercy by\r\nthem from God. The liberal, are those who redeem the captive from the\r\nplunderer, assist the poor, or discharge the debts of their friends.\r\nWe must give, therefore, but with discrimination and moderation; for\r\nmany persons have exhausted their patrimony by giving inconsiderately.\r\n“For what can be more silly, than to take pains to be no longer able\r\nto do that which you do with pleasure?”[348] Some, therefore, when\r\nthey have nothing to give turn to rapine, and get more hatred from\r\nthose from whom they take, than good will from those to whom they\r\ngive. We lament that thus it happened to this king; for, when in the\r\nvery beginning of his reign, through fear of tumults, he had assembled\r\nsoldiers, and denied them nothing, promising still greater remuneration\r\nhereafter; the consequence was, that as he had soon exhausted his\r\nfather’s treasures, and had then but moderate revenues, his substance\r\nfailed, though the spirit of giving remained, which, by habit, had\r\nalmost become nature. He was a man who knew not how to take off from\r\nthe price of any thing, or to judge of the value of goods; but the\r\ntrader might sell him his commodity at whatever rate, or the soldier\r\ndemand any pay he pleased. He was anxious that the cost of his clothes\r\nshould be extravagant, and angry if they were purchased at a low price.\r\nOne morning, indeed, while putting on his new boots, he asked his\r\nchamberlain what they cost; and when he replied, “Three shillings,”\r\nindignantly and in a rage he cried out, “You son of a whore, how long\r\nhas the king worn boots of so paltry a price? go, and bring me a pair\r\nworth a mark of silver.” He went, and bringing him a much cheaper\r\npair, told him, falsely, that they cost as much as he had ordered:\r\n“Aye,” said the king, “these are suitable to royal majesty.” Thus\r\nhis chamberlain used to charge him what he pleased for his clothes;\r\nacquiring by these means many things for his own advantage.\r\n\r\nThe fame of his generosity, therefore, pervaded all the West, and\r\nreached even to the East. Military men came to him out of every\r\nprovince on this side of the mountains, whom he rewarded most\r\nprofusely. In consequence, when he had no longer aught to bestow, poor\r\nand exhausted, he turned his thoughts to rapine. The rapacity of his\r\ndisposition was seconded by Ralph, the inciter of his covetousness;\r\na clergyman of the lowest origin, but raised to eminence by his wit\r\nand subtilty. If at any time a royal edict issued, that England\r\nshould pay a certain tribute, it was doubled by this plunderer of the\r\nrich, this exterminator of the poor, this confiscator of other men’s\r\ninheritance. He was an invincible pleader, as unrestrained in his\r\nwords as in his actions; and equally furious against the meek or the\r\nturbulent. Wherefore some people used to laugh,[349] and say, that he\r\nwas the only man who knew how to employ his talents in this way, and\r\ncared for no one’s hatred, so that he could please his master. At this\r\nperson’s suggestion, the sacred honours of the church, as the pastors\r\ndied, were exposed to sale: for whenever the death of any bishop or\r\nabbat was announced, directly one of the king’s clerks was admitted,\r\nwho made an inventory of every thing, and carried all future rents\r\ninto the royal exchequer. In the meantime some person was sought out\r\nfit to supply the place of the deceased; not from proof of morals,\r\nbut of money; and, at last, if I may so say, the empty honour was\r\nconferred, and even that purchased, at a great price. These things\r\nappeared the more disgraceful, because, in his father’s time, after\r\nthe decease of a bishop or abbat, all rents were reserved entire, to\r\nbe given up to the succeeding pastor; and persons truly meritorious,\r\non account of their religion, were elected. But in the lapse of a very\r\nfew years, every thing was changed. There was no man rich except the\r\nmoney-changer; no clerk, unless he was a lawyer; no priest, unless (to\r\nuse a word which is hardly Latin[350]) he was a farmer. Men of the\r\nmeanest condition, or guilty of whatever crime, were listened to, if\r\nthey could suggest any thing likely to be advantageous to the king: the\r\nhalter was loosened from the robber’s neck, if he could promise any\r\nemolument to the sovereign. All military discipline being relaxed, the\r\ncourtiers preyed upon the property of the country people, and consumed\r\ntheir substance, taking the very meat from the mouths of these wretched\r\ncreatures.[351] Then was there flowing hair and extravagant dress; and\r\nthen was invented the fashion of shoes[352] with curved points; then\r\nthe model for young men was to rival women in delicacy of person, to\r\nmince their gait, to walk with loose gesture, and half naked. Enervated\r\nand effeminate, they unwillingly remained what nature had made them;\r\nthe assailers of others’ chastity, prodigal of their own. Troops of\r\npathics, and droves of harlots, followed the court; so that it was\r\nsaid, with justice, by a wise man, that England would be fortunate if\r\nHenry could reign;[353] led to such an opinion, because he abhorred\r\nobscenity from his youth.\r\n\r\nHere, were it necessary, I could add, that archbishop Anselm attempted\r\nto correct these abuses; but failing of the co-operation of his\r\nsuffragans, he voluntarily quitted the kingdom, yielding to the\r\ndepravity of the times. Anselm, than whom none ever was more tenacious\r\nof right; none in the present time so thoroughly learned; none so\r\ncompletely spiritual; the father of his country, the mirror of the\r\nworld: he, when just about to set sail, after waiting in port for a\r\nwind, was rifled, as though he had been a public robber; all his bags\r\nand packages being brought out and ransacked. Of this man’s injuries I\r\ncould speak farther, had the sun witnessed any thing more unjust than\r\nthis single transaction, or were it not necessary to omit a relation,\r\nwhich has been anticipated by the eloquence of the very reverend\r\nEdmer.[354]\r\n\r\nHence may be perceived how fierce a flame of evil burst forth from\r\nwhat the king conceived to be liberality. In repressing which as he\r\ndid not manifest so much diligence as negligence, he incurred a degree\r\nof infamy, not only great, but scarcely to be wiped out. I think\r\nundeservedly, however; because he never could have exposed himself to\r\nsuch disgrace, had he only recollected the dignity of his station.\r\nI pass over, therefore, these matters slightly, and hasten in my\r\ncomposition, because I blush to relate the crimes of so great a king;\r\nrather giving my attention to refute and extenuate them.\r\n\r\nThe Jews in his reign gave proofs of their insolence towards God. At\r\none time, at Rouen, they endeavoured to prevail, by means of presents,\r\non some converted Jews, to return to Judaism;[355] at another, at\r\nLondon, entering into controversy with our bishops; because the\r\nking, in jest, as I suppose, had said, that if they mastered the\r\nChristians in open argument, he would become one of their sect. The\r\nquestion therefore was agitated with much apprehension on the part\r\nof the bishops and clergy, fearful, through pious anxiety, for the\r\nChristian faith. From this contest, however, the Jews reaped nothing\r\nbut confusion: though they used repeatedly to boast that they were\r\nvanquished, not by argument, but by power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1096.] ROBERT PAWNS NORMANDY.]\r\n\r\nIn later times, that is, about the ninth year of his reign, Robert,\r\nearl of Normandy, at the admonition of pope Urban, as will be related\r\nhereafter, took the resolution of going to Jerusalem, and pawned\r\nNormandy to his brother, for the sum of ten thousand marks. In\r\nconsequence, an edict for an intolerable tax was circulated throughout\r\nEngland. On this the bishops and abbats, in great numbers, went to\r\ncourt, to complain of the injury; observing that they could not raise\r\nso great an impost, unless they drove away their wretched husbandmen\r\naltogether. To this the courtiers, with angry countenance, as usual,\r\nreplied, “Have you not shrines adorned with gold and silver, full\r\nof dead men’s bones?” deigning the petitioners no other answer. In\r\nconsequence, perceiving the drift of the reply, they took off the gold\r\nfrom the shrines of their saints; robbed their crucifixes; melted their\r\nchalices; not for the service of the poor, but of the king’s exchequer.\r\nFor almost every thing, which the holy parsimony of their ancestors had\r\nsaved, was consumed by the rapacity of these freebooters.\r\n\r\nJust so, too, were their proceedings against their vassals; first\r\ntaking their money, then their land: neither the poor man’s poverty,\r\nnor the rich man’s abundance, protecting him. He so restricted the\r\nright of hunting, which he had formerly allowed, that it became a\r\ncapital offence to take a stag. This extreme severity, which was\r\ntempered by no affability, was the cause of many conspiracies, among\r\nthe nobility, against his safety: one of whom, Robert de Mowbray earl\r\nof Northumberland, in consequence of very high words between him\r\nand the king, retired to his province, with the intention of making\r\npowerful efforts against his lord; but William pursuing him, he was\r\ntaken, and doomed to perpetual captivity. Another, William de Hou,\r\nbeing accused of treachery towards the king, challenged his accuser to\r\nsingle combat; but being unable to justify himself in the duel, he was\r\ndeprived of his sight, and of his manhood. The same accusation involved\r\nmany innocent and honourable men; among whom was William de Aldrey, a\r\nman of handsome person, who had stood godfather[356] with the king.\r\nBeing sentenced to be hanged, he made his confession to Osmund bishop\r\nof Salisbury, and was scourged at every church of the town. Parting his\r\ngarments to the poor, he went naked to the gallows, often making the\r\nblood gush from his delicate flesh by falling on his knees upon the\r\nstones. He satisfied the minds of the bishop, and of the people who\r\nfollowed him to the place of punishment, by exclaiming, “God help my\r\nsoul, and deliver it from evil, as I am free from the charge, of which\r\nI am accused: the sentence, indeed, passed upon me will not be revoked,\r\nbut I wish all men to be certified of my innocence.” The bishop then,\r\ncommending his soul to heaven, and sprinkling him with holy water,\r\ndeparted. At his execution, he manifested an admirable degree of\r\ncourage; neither uttering a groan before, nor even a sigh, at the\r\nmoment of his death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1096.] WILLIAM’S MAGNANIMITY.]\r\n\r\nBut still there are some proofs of noble magnanimity in the king, the\r\nknowledge of which, I will not deny posterity. As he was once engaged\r\nin hunting in a certain forest, a foreign messenger acquainted him\r\nthat the city of Mans, which he had lately added to his dominions on\r\nthe departure of his brother, was besieged. Unprepared as he was, he\r\nturned his horse instantly, and shaped his journey to the sea. When his\r\nnobles reminded him, that it would be necessary to call out his troops,\r\nand put them in array; “I shall see,” said he, “who will follow me: do\r\nyou think I shall not have people enough? If I know the temper of the\r\nyoung men of my kingdom, they will even brave shipwreck to come to me.”\r\nIn this manner he arrived, almost unattended, at the sea-coast. The\r\nsky at that time was overcast, the wind contrary, and a tempest swept\r\nthe surface of the deep. When he determined to embark directly, the\r\nmariners besought him, to wait till the storm should subside, and the\r\nwind be favourable. “Why,” said William, “I have never heard of a king\r\nperishing by shipwreck: no, weigh anchor immediately, and you shall\r\nsee the elements conspire to obey me.” When the report of his having\r\ncrossed the sea reached the besiegers, they hastily retreated. One\r\nHelias, the author of the commotion, was taken; to whom, when brought\r\nbefore him, the king said jocularly, “I have you, master.” But he,\r\nwhose haughty spirit, even in such threatening danger, knew not how to\r\nbe prudent, or to speak submissively, replied, “You have taken me by\r\nchance; if I could escape, I know what I would do.” At this William,\r\nalmost beside himself with rage, and seizing Helias, exclaimed, “You\r\nscoundrel! and what would you do? Begone, depart, fly: I give you leave\r\nto do whatever you can; and by the crucifix at Lucca, if you should\r\nconquer me, I will ask no return for this favour.” Nor did he falsify\r\nhis word, but immediately suffered him to escape; rather admiring\r\nthan following the fugitive. Who could believe this of an unlettered\r\nman? And perhaps there may be some person, who, from reading Lucan,\r\nmay falsely suppose, that William borrowed these examples from Julius\r\nCæsar;[357] but he had neither inclination, nor leisure to attend\r\nto learning; it was rather the innate warmth of his temper, and his\r\nconscious valour which prompted him to such expressions. And indeed,\r\nif our religion would allow it, as the soul of Euphorbus was formerly\r\nsaid to have passed into Pythagoras of Samos, so might it equally be\r\nasserted, that the soul of Julius Cæsar had migrated into king William.\r\n\r\nHe began and completed one very noble edifice, the palace[358] in\r\nLondon; sparing no expense to manifest the greatness of his liberality.\r\nHis disposition therefore the reader will be able to discover from the\r\ncircumstances we have enumerated.\r\n\r\nShould any one be desirous, however, to know the make of his person,\r\nhe is to understand, that he was well set; his complexion florid, his\r\nhair yellow; of open countenance; different-coloured eyes, varying with\r\ncertain glittering specks; of astonishing strength, though not very\r\ntall, and his belly rather projecting; of no eloquence, but remarkable\r\nfor a hesitation of speech, especially when angry. Many sudden and\r\nsorrowful accidents happened in his time, which I shall arrange singly,\r\naccording to the years of his reign; chiefly vouching for their truth\r\non the credit of the Chronicles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1092-1100.] ADVERSE EVENTS.]\r\n\r\nIn the second year of his reign, on the third before the ides of\r\nAugust, a great earthquake terrified all England with a horrid\r\nspectacle; for all the buildings were lifted up, and then again settled\r\nas before. A scarcity of every kind of produce followed; the corn\r\nripened so slowly, that the harvest was scarcely housed before the\r\nfeast of St. Andrew.\r\n\r\nIn his fourth year was a tempest of lightning, and a whirlwind:\r\nfinally, on the ides of October, at Winchcombe, a stroke of lightning\r\nbeat against the side of the tower with such force, that, shattering\r\nthe wall where it joined to the roof, it opened a place wide enough to\r\nadmit a man; entering there, it struck a very large beam, and scattered\r\nfragments of it over the whole church; moreover it cast down the head\r\nof the crucifix, with the right leg, and the image of St. Mary. A\r\nstench so noisome followed, as to be insufferable to human nostrils.\r\nAt length, the monks, with auspicious boldness, entering, defeated\r\nthe contrivances of the devil, by the sprinkling of holy water. But\r\nwhat could this mean? such a thing was unknown to every previous age.\r\nA tempest of contending winds, from the south-east, on the sixteenth\r\nbefore the kalends of November, destroyed more than six hundred houses\r\nin London. Churches were heaped on houses, and walls on partitions. The\r\ntempest proceeding yet farther, carried off altogether the roof of the\r\nchurch of St. Mary le Bow, and killed two men. Rafters and beams were\r\nwhirled through the air, an object of surprise to such as contemplated\r\nthem from a distance; of alarm, to those who stood nigh, lest they\r\nshould be crushed by them. For four rafters, six and twenty feet long,\r\nwere driven with such violence into the ground, that scarcely four feet\r\nof them were visible. It was curious to see how they had perforated\r\nthe solidity of the public street, maintaining there the same position\r\nwhich they had occupied in the roof from the hand of the workman,\r\nuntil, on account of their inconvenience to passengers, they were cut\r\noff level with the ground, as they could not be otherwise removed.\r\n\r\nIn his fifth year, a similar thunder-storm at Salisbury entirely\r\ndestroyed the roof of the church-tower, and much injured the wall, only\r\nfive days after Osmund, the bishop of famed memory, had consecrated it.\r\n\r\nIn his sixth year there was such a deluge from rain, and such incessant\r\nshowers as none had ever remembered. Afterwards, on the approach of\r\nwinter, the rivers were so frozen, that they bore horsemen and waggons;\r\nand soon after, when the frost broke, the bridges were destroyed by the\r\ndrifting of the ice.\r\n\r\nIn his seventh year, on account of the heavy tribute which the king,\r\nwhile in Normandy, had levied, agriculture failed; of which failure\r\nthe immediate consequence was a famine. This also gaining ground a\r\nmortality ensued, so general, that the dying wanted attendance, and the\r\ndead, burial. At that time, too, the Welsh, fiercely raging against the\r\nNormans, and depopulating the county of Chester and part of Shropshire,\r\nobtained Anglesey by force of arms.\r\n\r\nIn his tenth year, on the kalends of October, a comet appeared for\r\nfifteen days, turning its larger train to the east, and the smaller\r\nto the south-east. Other stars also appeared, darting, as it were, at\r\neach other. This was the year in which Anselm, that light of England,\r\nvoluntarily escaping from the darkness of error, went to Rome.\r\n\r\nIn his eleventh year, Magnus, king of Norway, with Harold, son of\r\nHarold, formerly king of England, subdued the Orkney, Mevanian, and\r\nother circumjacent isles; and was now obstinately bent against England\r\nfrom Anglesey. But Hugh, earl of Chester, and Hugh, earl of Shrewsbury,\r\nopposed him; and ere he could gain the continent, forced him to retire.\r\nHere fell Hugh of Shrewsbury, being struck from a distance with a fatal\r\narrow.\r\n\r\nIn his twelfth year an excessive tide flowed up the Thames, and\r\noverwhelmed many villages, with their inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn his thirteenth year, which was the last of his life, there were many\r\nadverse events; but the most dreadful circumstance was that the devil\r\nvisibly appeared to men in woods and secret places, and spoke to them\r\nas they passed by. Moreover in the county of Berks, at the village of\r\nFinchampstead, a fountain so plentifully flowed with blood for fifteen\r\nwhole days, that it discoloured a neighbouring pool. The king heard of\r\nit and laughed; neither did he care for his own dreams, nor for what\r\nothers saw concerning him.\r\n\r\nThey relate many visions and predictions of his death, three of which,\r\nsanctioned by the testimony of credible authors, I shall communicate to\r\nmy readers. Edmer, the historian of our times, noted for his veracity,\r\nsays that Anselm, the noble exile, with whom all religion was also\r\nbanished, came to Marcigny that he might communicate his sufferings\r\nto Hugo, abbat of Clugny. There, when the conversation turned upon\r\nking William, the abbat aforesaid observed, “Last night that king\r\nwas brought before God; and by a deliberate judgment, incurred the\r\nsorrowful sentence of damnation.” How he came to know this he neither\r\nexplained at the time, nor did any of his hearers ask: nevertheless,\r\nout of respect to his piety, not a doubt of the truth of his words\r\nremained on the minds of any present. Hugh led such a life, and had\r\nsuch a character, that all regarded his discourse and venerated his\r\nadvice, as though an oracle from heaven had spoken. And soon after, the\r\nking being slain as we shall relate, there came a messenger to entreat\r\nthe archbishop to resume his see.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1100.] DEATH OF WILLIAM II.]\r\n\r\nThe day before the king died, he dreamed that he was let blood by\r\na surgeon; and that the stream, reaching to heaven, clouded the\r\nlight, and intercepted the day. Calling on St. Mary for protection,\r\nhe suddenly awoke, commanded a light to be brought, and forbade his\r\nattendants to leave him. They then watched with him several hours until\r\ndaylight. Shortly after, just as the day began to dawn, a certain\r\nforeign monk told Robert Fitz Hamon, one of the principal nobility,\r\nthat he had that night dreamed a strange and fearful dream about the\r\nking: “That he had come into a certain church, with menacing and\r\ninsolent gesture, as was his custom, looking contemptuously on the\r\nstanders by; then violently seizing the crucifix, he gnawed the arms,\r\nand almost tore away the legs: that the image endured this for a long\r\ntime, but at length struck the king with its foot in such a manner\r\nthat he fell backwards: from his mouth, as he lay prostrate, issued\r\nso copious a flame that the volumes of smoke touched the very stars.”\r\nRobert, thinking that this dream ought not to be neglected, as he\r\nwas intimate with him, immediately related it to the king. William,\r\nrepeatedly laughing, exclaimed, “He is a monk, and dreams for money\r\nlike a monk: give him a hundred shillings.” Nevertheless, being greatly\r\nmoved, he hesitated a long while whether he should go out to hunt, as\r\nhe had designed: his friends persuading him not to suffer the truth\r\nof the dreams to be tried at his personal risk. In consequence, he\r\nabstained from the chase before dinner, dispelling the uneasiness of\r\nhis unregulated mind by serious business. They relate, that, having\r\nplentifully regaled that day, he soothed his cares with a more than\r\nusual quantity of wine. After dinner he went into the forest, attended\r\nby few persons; of whom the most intimate with him was Walter, surnamed\r\nTirel, who had been induced to come from France by the liberality of\r\nthe king. This man alone had remained with him, while the others,\r\nemployed in the chase, were dispersed as chance directed. The sun was\r\nnow declining, when the king, drawing his bow and letting fly an arrow,\r\nslightly wounded a stag which passed before him; and, keenly gazing,\r\nfollowed it, still running, a long time with his eyes, holding up his\r\nhand to keep off the power of the sun’s rays. At this instant Walter,\r\nconceiving a noble exploit, which was while the king’s attention was\r\notherwise occupied to transfix another stag which by chance came near\r\nhim, unknowingly, and without power to prevent it, Oh, gracious God!\r\npierced his breast with a fatal arrow.[359] On receiving the wound,\r\nthe king uttered not a word; but breaking off the shaft of the weapon\r\nwhere it projected from his body, fell upon the wound, by which he\r\naccelerated his death. Walter immediately ran up, but as he found him\r\nsenseless and speechless, he leaped swiftly upon his horse, and escaped\r\nby spurring him to his utmost speed. Indeed there was none to pursue\r\nhim: some connived at his flight; others pitied him; and all were\r\nintent on other matters. Some began to fortify their dwellings; others\r\nto plunder; and the rest to look out for a new king. A few countrymen\r\nconveyed the body, placed on a cart, to the cathedral at Winchester;\r\nthe blood dripping from it all the way. Here it was committed to the\r\nground within the tower, attended by many of the nobility, though\r\nlamented by few. Next year,[360] the tower fell; though I forbear to\r\nmention the different opinions on this subject, lest I should seem\r\nto assent too readily to unsupported trifles, more especially as the\r\nbuilding might have fallen, through imperfect construction, even though\r\nhe had never been buried there. He died in the year of our Lord’s\r\nincarnation 1100, of his reign the thirteenth, on the fourth before the\r\nnones of August, aged above forty years. He formed mighty plans, which\r\nhe would have brought to effect, could he have spun out the tissue of\r\nfate, or broken through, and disengaged himself from, the violence of\r\nfortune. Such was the energy of his mind, that he was bold enough to\r\npromise himself any kingdom whatever. Indeed the day before his death,\r\nbeing asked where he would keep his Christmas, he answered, in Poitou;\r\nbecause the earl of Poitou, wishing anxiously to go to Jerusalem, was\r\nsaid to be about to pawn his territory to him. Thus, not content with\r\nhis paternal possessions, and allured by expectation of greater glory,\r\nhe grasped at honours not pertaining to him. He was a man much to be\r\npitied by the clergy, for throwing away a soul which they could not\r\nsave; to be beloved by stipendiary soldiers, for the multitude of his\r\ngifts; but not to be lamented by the people, because he suffered their\r\nsubstance to be plundered. I remember no council being held in his\r\ntime, wherein the health of the church might be strengthened through\r\nthe correction of abuses. He hesitated a long time ere he bestowed\r\necclesiastical honours, either for the sake of emolument, or of\r\nweighing desert. So that on the day he died, he held in his own hands\r\nthree bishoprics, and twelve vacant abbeys. Besides, seeking occasion\r\nfrom the schism between Urban in Rome and Guibert at Ravenna, he\r\nforbade the payment of the tribute[361] to the holy see: though he was\r\nmore inclined to favour Guibert; because the ground and instigation of\r\nthe discord between himself and Anselm was, that this man, so dear to\r\nGod, had pronounced Urban to be pope, the other an apostate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1100.] OF THE CISTERTIAN ORDER.]\r\n\r\nIn his time began the Cistertian order, which is now both believed and\r\nasserted to be the surest road to heaven.[362] To speak of this does\r\nnot seem irrelevant to the work I have undertaken, since it redounds\r\nto the glory of England to have produced the distinguished man who\r\nwas the author and promoter of that rule. To us he belonged, and in\r\nour schools passed the earlier part of his life. Wherefore, if we\r\nare not envious, we shall embrace his good qualities the more kindly\r\nin proportion as we knew them more intimately. And, moreover, I am\r\nanxious to extol his praise, “because it is a mark of an ingenuous\r\nmind to approve that virtue in others, of which in yourself you regret\r\nthe absence.” He was named Harding, and born in England of no very\r\nillustrious parents. From his early years, he was a monk at Sherborne;\r\nbut when secular desires had captivated his youth, he grew disgusted\r\nwith the monastic garb, and went first to Scotland, and afterwards\r\nto France. Here, after some years’ exercise in the liberal arts, he\r\nbecame awakened to the love of God. For, when manlier years had put\r\naway childish things, he went to Rome with a clerk who partook of his\r\nstudies; neither the length and difficulty of the journey, nor the\r\nscantiness of their means of subsistence by the way, preventing them,\r\nboth as they went and returned, from singing daily the whole psalter.\r\nIndeed the mind of this celebrated man was already meditating the\r\ndesign which soon after, by the grace of God, he attempted to put in\r\nexecution. For returning into Burgundy, he was shorn at Molesmes, a new\r\nand magnificent monastery. Here he readily admitted the first elements\r\nof the order, as he had formerly seen them; but when additional matters\r\nwere proposed for his observance, such as he had neither read in the\r\nrule nor seen elsewhere, he began, modestly and as became a monk, to\r\nask the reason of them, saying: “By reason the supreme Creator has\r\nmade all things; by reason he governs all things; by reason the fabric\r\nof the world revolves; by reason even the planets move; by reason the\r\nelements are directed; and by reason, and by due regulation, our\r\nnature ought to conduct itself. But since, through sloth, she too often\r\ndeparts from reason, many laws were, long ago, enacted for her use;\r\nand, latterly, a divine rule has been promulgated by St. Benedict, to\r\nbring back the deviations of nature to reason. In this, though some\r\nthings are contained the design of which I cannot fathom, yet I deem it\r\nnecessary to yield to authority. And though reason and the authority of\r\nthe holy writers may seem at variance, yet still they are one and the\r\nsame. For since God hath created and restored nothing without reason,\r\nhow can I believe that the holy fathers, no doubt strict followers of\r\nGod, could command anything but what was reasonable, as if we ought to\r\ngive credit to their bare authority. See then that you bring reason,\r\nor at least authority, for what you devise; although no great credit\r\nshould be given to what is merely supported by human reason, because\r\nit may be combated with arguments equally forcible. Therefore from\r\nthat rule, which, equally supported by reason and authority, appears\r\nas if dictated by the spirit of all just persons, produce precedents,\r\nwhich if you fail to do, in vain shall you profess his rule, whose\r\nregulations you disdain to comply with.”\r\n\r\nSentiments of this kind, spreading as usual from one to another,\r\njustly moved the hearts of such as feared God, “lest haply they should\r\nor had run in vain.” The subject, then, being canvassed in frequent\r\nchapters, ended by bringing over the abbat himself to the opinion that\r\nall superfluous matters should be passed by, and merely the essence of\r\nthe rule be scrutinized. Two of the fraternity, therefore, of equal\r\nfaith and learning, were elected, who, by vicarious examination,\r\nwere to discover the intention of the founder’s rule; and when they\r\nhad discovered it, to propound it to the rest. The abbat diligently\r\nendeavoured to induce the whole convent to give their concurrence,\r\nbut “as it is difficult to eradicate from men’s minds, what has early\r\ntaken root, since they reluctantly relinquish the first notions they\r\nhave imbibed,” almost the whole of them refused to accept the new\r\nregulations, because they were attached to the old. Eighteen only,\r\namong whom was Harding, otherwise called Stephen, persevering in their\r\nholy determination, together with their abbat, left the monastery,\r\ndeclaring that the purity of the institution could not be preserved in\r\na place where riches and gluttony warred against even the heart that\r\nwas well inclined. They came therefore to Citeaux; a situation formerly\r\ncovered with woods, but now so conspicuous from the abundant piety\r\nof its monks, that it is not undeservedly esteemed conscious of the\r\nDivinity himself. Here, by the countenance of the archbishop of Vienne,\r\nwho is now pope, they entered on a labour worthy to be remembered and\r\nvenerated to the end of time.\r\n\r\nCertainly many of their regulations seem severe, and more particularly\r\nthese: they wear nothing made with furs or linen, nor even that finely\r\nspun linen garment, which we call Staminium;[363] neither breeches,\r\nunless when sent on a journey, which at their return they wash and\r\nrestore. They have two tunics with cowls, but no additional garment in\r\nwinter, though, if they think fit, in summer they may lighten their\r\ngarb. They sleep clad and girded, and never after matins return to\r\ntheir beds: but they so order the time of matins that it shall be light\r\nere the lauds[364] begin; so intent are they on their rule, that they\r\nthink no jot or tittle of it should be disregarded. Directly after\r\nthese hymns they sing the prime, after which they go out to work for\r\nstated hours. They complete whatever labour or service they have to\r\nperform by day without any other light. No one is ever absent from the\r\ndaily services, or from complines, except the sick. The cellarer and\r\nhospitaller, after complines, wait upon the guests, yet observing the\r\nstrictest silence. The abbat allows himself no indulgence beyond the\r\nothers,--every where present,--every where attending to his flock;\r\nexcept that he does not eat with the rest, because his table is with\r\nthe strangers and the poor. Nevertheless, be he where he may, he is\r\nequally sparing of food and of speech; for never more than two dishes\r\nare served either to him or to his company; lard and meat never but to\r\nthe sick. From the Ides of September till Easter, through regard for\r\nwhatever festival, they do not take more than one meal a day, except on\r\nSunday. They never leave the cloister but for the purpose of labour,\r\nnor do they ever speak, either there or elsewhere, save only to the\r\nabbat or prior. They pay unwearied attention to the canonical[365]\r\nservices, making no addition to them except the vigil for the defunct.\r\nThey use in their divine service the Ambrosian chants[366] and hymns,\r\nas far as they were able to learn them at Milan. While they bestow care\r\non the stranger and the sick, they inflict intolerable mortifications\r\non their own bodies, for the health of their souls.\r\n\r\nThe abbat, at first, both encountered these privations with much\r\nalacrity himself, and compelled the rest to do the same. In process of\r\ntime, however, the man repented;[367] he had been delicately brought\r\nup, and could not well bear such continued scantiness of diet. The\r\nmonks, whom he had left at Molesmes, getting scent of this disposition,\r\neither by messages or letters, for it is uncertain which, drew him\r\nback to the monastery, by his obedience to the pope, for such was\r\ntheir pretext: compelling him to a measure to which he was already\r\nextremely well-disposed. For, as if wearied out by the pertinacity of\r\ntheir entreaties, he left the narrow confines of poverty, and resought\r\nhis former magnificence. All followed him from Citeaux, who had gone\r\nthither with him, except eight. These, few in number but great in\r\nvirtue, appointed Alberic, one of their party, abbat, and Stephen\r\nprior. The former not surviving more than eight years was, at the will\r\nof heaven, happily called away. Then, doubtless by God’s appointment,\r\nStephen though absent was elected abbat; the original contriver of\r\nthe whole scheme; the especial and celebrated ornament of our times.\r\nSixteen abbeys which he has already completed, and seven which he\r\nhas begun, are sufficient testimonies of his abundant merit. Thus,\r\nby the resounding trumpet of God, he directs the people around him,\r\nboth by word and deed, to heaven; acting fully up to his own precepts;\r\naffable in speech, pleasant in look, and with a mind always rejoicing\r\nin the Lord. Hence, openly, that noble joy of countenance; hence,\r\nsecretly, that compunction, coming from above; because, despising\r\nthis state of a sojourner, he constantly desires to be in a place\r\nof rest. For these causes he is beloved by all; “For God graciously\r\nimparts to the minds of other men a love for that man whom he loves.”\r\nWherefore the inhabitant of that country esteems himself happy if,\r\nthrough his hands, he can transmit his wealth to God. He receives\r\nmuch, indeed, but expending little on his own wants, or those of his\r\nflock, he distributes the rest to the poor, or employs it immediately\r\non the building of monasteries; for the purse of Stephen is the public\r\ntreasury of the indigent. A proof of his abstinence is that you see\r\nnothing there, as in other monasteries, flaming with gold, blazing with\r\njewels, or glittering with silver. For as a Gentile says, “Of what use\r\nis gold to a saint?” We think it not enough in our holy vases, unless\r\nthe ponderous metal be eclipsed by precious stones; by the flame of\r\nthe topaz, the violet of the amethyst, and the green shade of the\r\nemerald: unless the sacerdotal robes wanton with gold; and unless the\r\nwalls glisten with various coloured paintings, and throw the reflexion\r\nof the sun’s rays upon the ceiling. These men, however, placing those\r\nthings which mortals foolishly esteem the first, only in a secondary\r\npoint of view, give all their diligence to improve their morals, and\r\nlove pure minds, more than glittering vestments; knowing that the\r\nbest remuneration for doing well, is to enjoy a clear conscience.\r\nMoreover, if at any time the laudable kindness of the abbat either\r\ndesires, or feigns a desire, to modify aught from the strict letter\r\nof the rule, they are ready to oppose such indulgence, saying, that\r\nthey have no long time to live, nor shall they continue to exist so\r\nlong as they have already done; that they hope to remain stedfast in\r\ntheir purpose to the end, and to be an example to their successors, who\r\nwill transgress if they should give way. And, indeed, through human\r\nweakness, the perpetual law of which is that nothing attained, even by\r\nthe greatest labour, can long remain unchanged, it will be so. But to\r\ncomprise, briefly, all things which are or can be said of them,--the\r\nCistertian monks at the present day are a model for all monks, a mirror\r\nfor the diligent, a spur to the indolent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1100.] HERBERT, BISHOP OF NORWICH.]\r\n\r\nAt this time three sees in England were transferred from their ancient\r\nsituations; Wells to Bath, by John; Chester to Coventry, by Robert;\r\nThetford to Norwich, by Herbert; all through greater ambition, than\r\nought to have influenced men of such eminence. Finally, to speak\r\nof the last first: Herbert, from his skill in adulation, surnamed\r\nLosinga,[368] was first abbat of Ramsey, and then purchased the\r\nbishopric of Thetford, while his father, Robert, surnamed as himself,\r\nwas intruded on the abbey of Winchester. This man, then, was the great\r\nsource of simony in England; having craftily procured by means of his\r\nwealth, both an abbey and a bishopric. For he hood-winked the king’s\r\nsolicitude for the church by his money, and whispered great promises\r\nto secure the favour of the nobility: whence a poet of those times\r\nadmirably observes,\r\n\r\n “A monster in the church from Losing rose,\r\n  Base Simon’s sect, the canons to oppose.\r\n  Peter, thou’rt slow; see Simon soars on high;\r\n  If present, soon thou’d’st hurl him from the sky.[369]\r\n  Oh grief, the church is let to sordid hire,\r\n  The son a bishop, abbat is the sire.\r\n  All may be hoped from gold’s prevailing sway,\r\n  Which governs all things; gives and takes away;\r\n  Makes bishops, abbats, basely in a day.”\r\n\r\nFuture repentance, however, atoned for the errors of his youth: he\r\nwent to Rome, when he was of a more serious age, and there resigning\r\nthe staff and ring which he had acquired by simony, had them restored\r\nthrough the indulgence of that most merciful see; for the Romans\r\nregard it both as more holy and more fitting, that the dues from each\r\nchurch should rather come into their own purse, than be subservient\r\nto the use of any king whatever. Herbert thus returning home, removed\r\nthe episcopal see, which had formerly been at Helmham, and was then\r\nat Thetford, to a town, celebrated for its trade and populousness,\r\ncalled Norwich. Here he settled a congregation of monks, famous for\r\ntheir numbers and their morals; purchasing everything for them out of\r\nhis private fortune. For, having an eye to the probable complaints of\r\nhis successors, he gave none of the episcopal lands to the monastery,\r\nlest they should deprive the servants of God of their subsistence,\r\nif they found any thing given to them which pertained to their see.\r\nAt Thetford, too, he settled Clugniac monks, because the members\r\nof that order, dispersed throughout the world, are rich in worldly\r\npossessions, and of distinguished piety towards God. Thus, by the great\r\nand extensive merit of his virtues, he shrouded the multitude of his\r\nformer failings; and by his abundant eloquence and learning, as well as\r\nby his knowledge in secular affairs, he became worthy even of the Roman\r\npontificate. Herbert thus changed, as Lucan observes of Curio, became\r\nthe changer and mover of all things; and, as in the times of this king,\r\nhe had been a pleader in behalf of simony, so was he, afterwards, its\r\nmost strenuous opposer; nor did he suffer that to be done by others,\r\nwhich he lamented he had ever himself done through the presumption of\r\njuvenile ardour: ever having in his mouth, as they relate, the saying\r\nof St. Jerome, “We have erred when young; let us amend now we are old.”\r\nFinally, who can sufficiently extol his conduct, who, though not a very\r\nrich bishop, yet built so noble a monastery; in which nothing appears\r\ndefective, either in the beauty of the lofty edifice, the elegance of\r\nits ornaments, or in the piety and universal charity of its monks.\r\nThese things soothed him with joyful hope while he lived, and when\r\ndead, if repentance be not in vain, conducted him to heaven.[370]\r\n\r\nJohn was bishop of Wells; a native of Touraine, and an approved\r\nphysician, by practice, rather than education. On the death of the\r\nabbat of Bath, he easily obtained the abbey from the king, both because\r\nall things at court were exposed to sale, and his covetousness seemed\r\npalliated by some degree of reason, that so famed a city might be still\r\nmore celebrated, by becoming the see of a bishop. He at first began to\r\nexercise his severity against the monks, because they were dull, and\r\nin his estimation, barbarians; taking away all the lands ministering\r\nto their subsistence, and furnishing them with but scanty provision\r\nby his lay dependants. In process of time, however, when new monks\r\nhad been admitted, he conducted himself with more mildness; and gave a\r\nsmall portion of land to the prior, by which he might, in some measure,\r\nsupport himself and his inmates. And although he had begun austerely,\r\nyet many things were there by him both nobly begun and completed, in\r\ndecorations and in books; and more especially, in a selection of monks,\r\nequally notable for their learning and kind offices. But still he could\r\nnot, even at his death, be softened far enough totally to exonerate\r\nthe lands from bondage; leaving, in this respect, an example not to be\r\nfollowed by his successors.\r\n\r\nThere was in the diocese of Chester, a monastery, called Coventry,\r\nwhich, as I have before related, the most noble earl Leofric, with his\r\nlady Godiva, had built; so splendid for its gold and silver, that the\r\nvery walls of the church seemed too scanty to receive the treasures,\r\nto the great astonishment of the beholders. This, Robert bishop of\r\nthe diocese eagerly seized on, in a manner by no means episcopal;\r\nstealing from the very treasures of the church wherewith he might fill\r\nthe hand of the king, beguile the vigilance of the pope, and gratify\r\nthe covetousness of the Romans. Continuing there many years, he gave\r\nno proof of worth whatever: for, so far from rescuing the nodding\r\nroofs from ruin, he wasted the sacred treasures, and became guilty\r\nof peculation; and a bishop might have been convicted of illegal\r\nexactions, had an accuser been at hand. He fed the monks on miserable\r\nfare, made no attempts to excite in them a love for their profession,\r\nand suffered them to reach only a very common degree of learning; lest\r\nhe should make them delicate by sumptuous living, or strictness of rule\r\nand depth of learning should spirit them up to oppose him. Contented\r\ntherefore with rustic fare, and humble literary attainments, they\r\ndeemed it enough, if they could only live in peace. Moreover, at his\r\ndeath, paying little attention to the dictates of the canons, by which\r\nit is enacted, that bishops ought to be buried in their cathedrals,\r\nhe commanded himself to be interred, not at Chester, but at Coventry;\r\nleaving to his successors by such a decision, the task, not of claiming\r\nwhat was not due to them, but as it were, of vindicating their proper\r\nright.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1100.] JOSCELYN.]\r\n\r\nHere, while speaking of the times of William, I should be induced to\r\nrelate the translation of the most excellent Augustine, the apostle of\r\nthe English and of his companions, had not the talents of the learned\r\nJoscelyn, anticipated me:[371] of Joscelyn, who being a monk of St.\r\nBertin, formerly came to England with Herman bishop of Salisbury,\r\nskilled equally in literature and music. For a considerable time he\r\nvisited the cathedrals and abbeys, and left proofs of uncommon learning\r\nin many places; he was second to none after Bede in the celebration of\r\nthe English saints; next to Osberne[372] too, he bore away the palm\r\nin music. Moreover he wrote innumerable lives of modern saints, and\r\nrestored, in an elegant manner, such of those of the ancients as had\r\nbeen lost through the confusion of the times, or had been carelessly\r\nedited. He also so exquisitely wrought the process of this translation,\r\nthat he may be said to have realized it to the present race, and given\r\na view of it to posterity. Happy that tongue, which ministered to so\r\nmany saints! happy that voice, which poured forth such melody! more\r\nespecially as in his life, his probity equalled his learning. But, as I\r\nhave hitherto recorded disgraceful transactions of certain bishops, I\r\nwill introduce others of different lives and dispositions, who were in\r\nbeing at the same time; that our age may not be said to have grown so\r\nnegligent as not to produce one single saint. Such as are desirous, may\r\nfind this promise completed in a subsequent book, after the narrative\r\nof king Henry’s transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n_The Expedition to Jerusalem._ [A.D. 1095-1105.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall now describe the expedition to Jerusalem, relating in my own\r\nwords what was seen and endured by others. Besides too, as opportunity\r\noffers, I shall select from ancient writers, accounts of the situation\r\nand riches of Constantinople, Antioch, and Jerusalem; in order that he\r\nwho is unacquainted with these matters, and meets with this work, may\r\nhave something to communicate to others. But for such a relation there\r\nneeds a more fervent spirit, in order to complete effectually, what\r\nI begin with such pleasure. Invoking, therefore, the Divinity, as is\r\nusual, I begin as follows.\r\n\r\nIn the year of the incarnation 1095, pope Urban the second, who then\r\nfilled the papal throne, passing the Alps, came into France. The\r\nostensible cause of his journey, was, that, being driven from home\r\nby the violence of Guibert, he might prevail on the churches on this\r\nside of the mountains to acknowledge him. His more secret intention\r\nwas not so well known; this was, by Boamund’s advice, to excite almost\r\nthe whole of Europe to undertake an expedition into Asia; that in\r\nsuch a general commotion of all countries, auxiliaries might easily\r\nbe engaged, by whose means both Urban might obtain Rome; and Boamund,\r\nIllyria and Macedonia. For Guiscard, his father, had conquered those\r\ncountries from Alexius, and also all the territory extending from\r\nDurazzo to Thessalonica; wherefore Boamund claimed them as his due,\r\nsince he obtained not the inheritance of Apulia, which his father had\r\ngiven to his younger son, Roger. Still nevertheless, whatever might\r\nbe the cause of Urban’s journey, it turned out of great and singular\r\nadvantage to the Christian world. A council, therefore, was assembled\r\nat Clermont,[373] which is the most noted city of Auvergne. The number\r\nof bishops and abbats was three hundred and ten. Here at first, during\r\nseveral days, a long discussion was carried on concerning the catholic\r\nfaith, and the establishing peace among contending parties.[374] For,\r\nin addition to those crimes in which every one indulged, all, on this\r\nside of the Alps, had arrived at such a calamitous state, as to take\r\neach other captive on little or no pretence; nor were they suffered to\r\ngo free, unless ransomed at an enormous price. Again too, the snake of\r\nsimony had so reared her slippery crest, and cherished, with poisonous\r\nwarmth, her deadly eggs, that the whole world became infected with her\r\nmortal hissing, and tainted the honours of the church. At that time, I\r\nwill not say bishops to their sees merely, but none aspired even to any\r\necclesiastical degree, except by the influence of money. Then too, many\r\npersons putting away their lawful wives, procured divorces, and invaded\r\nthe marriage-couch of others. Wherefore, as in both these cases, there\r\nwas a mixed multitude of offenders, the names of some powerful persons\r\nwere singled out for punishment. Not to be tedious, I will subjoin\r\nthe result of the whole council, abbreviating some parts, in my own\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1095.] COUNCIL OF CLERMONT.]\r\n\r\nIn a council at Clermont, in the presence of pope Urban, these articles\r\nwere enacted. “That the catholic church shall be pure in faith; free\r\nfrom all servitude: that bishops, or abbats, or clergy of any rank,\r\nshall receive no ecclesiastical dignity from the hand of princes,\r\nor of any of the laity: that clergymen shall not hold prebends in\r\ntwo churches or cities: that no one shall be bishop and abbat at the\r\nsame time: that ecclesiastical dignities shall be bought and sold\r\nby no one: that no person in holy orders shall be guilty of carnal\r\nintercourse: that such as not knowing the canonical prohibition had\r\npurchased canonries, should be pardoned: but that they should be taken\r\nfrom such as knew they possessed them by their own purchase, or that\r\nof their parents: that no layman from Ash-Wednesday, no clergyman from\r\nQuadragesima, to Easter, shall eat flesh: that, at all times, the first\r\nfast of the Ember Weeks, should be in the first week of Lent: that\r\norders should be conferred, at all times, on the evening of Saturday,\r\nor on a Sunday, continuing fasting:[375] that on Easter-eve, service\r\nshould not be celebrated till after the ninth hour: that the second\r\nfast should be observed in the week of Pentecost: that from our Lord’s\r\nAdvent, to the octave of the Epiphany; from Septuagesima to the octaves\r\nof Easter; from the first day of the Rogations to the octaves of\r\nPentecost; and from the fourth day of the week at sunset, at all times,\r\nto the second day in the following week at sunrise, the Truce of God be\r\nobserved:[376] that whoever laid violent hands on a bishop should be\r\nexcommunicated; that whoever laid violent hands on clergymen or their\r\nservants should be accursed: that whoever seized the goods of bishops\r\nor clergymen at their deaths, should be accursed: that whoever married\r\na relation, even in the sixth degree of consanguinity, should be\r\naccursed: that none should be chosen bishop, except a priest, deacon,\r\nor subdeacon who was of noble descent, unless under pressing necessity,\r\nand licence from the pope: that the sons of priests and concubines\r\nshould not be advanced to the priesthood, unless they first made their\r\nvow: that whosoever fled to the church, or the cross, should, being\r\ninsured from loss of limb, be delivered up to justice; or if innocent,\r\nbe released: that every church should enjoy its own tithes, nor pass\r\nthem away to another: that laymen should neither buy nor sell tithes;\r\nthat no fee should be demanded for the burial of the dead. In this\r\ncouncil the pope excommunicated Philip, king of France, and all who\r\ncalled him king or lord, and obeyed or spoke to him, unless for the\r\npurpose of correcting him: in like manner too his accursed consort,\r\nand all who called her queen or lady, till they so far reformed as\r\nto separate from each other: and also Guibert of Ravenna, who calls\r\nhimself pope: and Henry, emperor of Germany, who supports him.”\r\n\r\nAfterwards, a clear and forcible discourse, such as should come from a\r\npriest, was addressed to the people, on the subject of an expedition of\r\nthe Christians, against the Turks. This I have thought fit to transmit\r\nto posterity, as I have learned it from those who were present,\r\npreserving its sense unimpaired. For who can preserve the force of that\r\neloquence? We shall be fortunate, if, treading an adjacent path, we\r\ncome even by a circuitous route to its meaning.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1095.] POPE URBAN’S SPEECH.]\r\n\r\n“You recollect,”[377] said he, “my dearest brethren, many things which\r\nhave been decreed for you, at this time; some matters, in our council,\r\ncommanded; others inhibited. A rude and confused chaos of crimes\r\nrequired the deliberation of many days; an inveterate malady demanded\r\na sharp remedy. For while we give unbounded scope to our clemency, our\r\npapal office finds numberless matters to proscribe; none to spare.\r\nBut it has hitherto arisen from human frailty, that you have erred,\r\nand that, deceived by the speciousness of vice, you have exasperated\r\nthe long suffering of God, by too lightly regarding his forbearance.\r\nIt has arisen too from human wantonness, that, disregarding lawful\r\nwedlock, you have not duly considered the heinousness of adultery.\r\nFrom too great covetousness also, it has arisen, that, as opportunity\r\noffered, making captive your brethren, bought by the same great price,\r\nyou have outrageously extorted from them their wealth. To you, however,\r\nnow suffering this perilous shipwreck of sin, a secure haven of rest\r\nis offered, unless you neglect it. A station of perpetual safety will\r\nbe awarded you, for the exertion of a trifling labour against the\r\nTurks. Compare, now, the labours which you underwent in the practice\r\nof wickedness, and those which you will encounter in the undertaking\r\nI advise. The intention of committing adultery, or murder, begets\r\nmany fears; for, as Soloman says, ‘There is nothing more timid than\r\nguilt:’ many labours; for what is more toilsome than wickedness?\r\nBut, ‘He who walks uprightly, walks securely.’ Of these labours, of\r\nthese fears, the end was sin; the wages of sin is death; the death\r\nof sinners is most dreadful. Now the same labours and apprehensions\r\nare required from you, for a better consideration. The cause of these\r\nlabours, will be charity; if thus warned by the command of God, you\r\nlay down your lives for the brethren: the wages of charity will be\r\nthe grace of God; the grace of God is followed by eternal life. Go\r\nthen prosperously: Go, then, with confidence, to attack the enemies of\r\nGod. For they long since, oh sad reproach to Christians! have seized\r\nSyria, Armenia, and lastly, all Asia Minor, the provinces of which\r\nare Bithynia, Phrygia, Galatia, Lydia, Caria, Pamphylia, Isauria,\r\nLycia, Cilicia; and, now they insolently domineer over Illyricum, and\r\nall the hither countries, even to the sea which is called the Straits\r\nof St. George. Nay, they usurp even the sepulchre of our Lord, that\r\nsingular assurance of our faith; and sell to our pilgrims admissions\r\nto that city, which ought, had they a trace of their ancient courage\r\nleft, to be open to Christians only. This alone might be enough to\r\ncloud our brows; but now, who except the most abandoned, or the most\r\nenvious of Christian reputation, can endure that we do not divide the\r\nworld equally with them? They inhabit Asia, the third portion of the\r\nworld, as their native soil, which was justly esteemed by our ancestors\r\nequal, by the extent of its tracts and greatness of its provinces, to\r\nthe two remaining parts. There, formerly, sprang up the first germs\r\nof our faith; there, all the apostles, except two, consecrated their\r\ndeaths; there, at the present day, the Christians, if any survive,\r\nsustaining life by a wretched kind of agriculture, pay these miscreants\r\ntribute, and even with stifled sighs, long for the participation of\r\nyour liberty, since they have lost their own. They hold Africa also,\r\nanother quarter of the world, already possessed by their arms for more\r\nthan two hundred years; which on this account I pronounce derogatory\r\nto Christian honour, because that country was anciently the nurse of\r\ncelebrated geniuses, who, by their divine writings, will mock the rust\r\nof antiquity as long as there shall be a person who can relish Roman\r\nliterature:[378] the learned know the truth of what I say. Europe, the\r\nthird portion of the world remains; of which, how small a part do we\r\nChristians inhabit? for who can call all those barbarians who dwell in\r\nremote islands of the Frozen Ocean, Christians, since they live after a\r\nsavage manner? Even this small portion of the world, belonging to us,\r\nis oppressed by the Turks and Saracens. Thus for three hundred years,\r\nSpain and the Balearic isles have been subjugated to them, and the\r\npossession of the remainder is eagerly anticipated by feeble men, who,\r\nnot having courage to engage in close encounter, love a flying mode\r\nof warfare. For the Turk never ventures upon close fight; but, when\r\ndriven from his station, bends his bow at a distance, and trusts the\r\nwinds with his meditated wound; and as he has poisoned arrows, venom,\r\nand not valour, inflicts the death on the man he strikes. Whatever he\r\neffects, then, I attribute to fortune, not to courage, because he wars\r\nby flight, and by poison. It is apparent too, that every race, born in\r\nthat region, being scorched with the intense heat of the sun, abounds\r\nmore in reflexion, than in blood; and, therefore, they avoid coming to\r\nclose quarters, because they are aware how little blood they possess.\r\nWhereas the people who are born amid the polar frosts, and distant from\r\nthe sun’s heat, are less cautious indeed; but, elate from their copious\r\nand luxuriant flow of blood, they fight with the greatest alacrity. You\r\nare a nation born in the more temperate regions of the world; who may\r\nbe both prodigal of blood, in defiance of death and wounds; and are not\r\ndeficient in prudence. For you equally preserve good conduct in camp,\r\nand are considerate in battle. Thus endued with skill and with valour,\r\nyou undertake a memorable expedition. You will be extolled throughout\r\nall ages, if you rescue your brethren from danger. To those present, in\r\nGod’s name, I command this; to the absent I enjoin it. Let such as are\r\ngoing to fight for Christianity, put the form of the cross upon their\r\ngarments, that they may, outwardly, demonstrate the love arising from\r\ntheir inward faith; enjoying by the gift of God, and the privilege of\r\nSt. Peter, absolution from all their crimes: let this in the meantime\r\nsoothe the labour of their journey; satisfied that they shall obtain,\r\nafter death, the advantages of a blessed martyrdom. Putting an end to\r\nyour crimes then, that Christians may at least live peaceably in these\r\ncountries, go, and employ in nobler warfare, that valour, and that\r\nsagacity, which you used to waste in civil broils: Go, soldiers every\r\nwhere renowned in fame, go, and subdue these dastardly nations. Let the\r\nnoted valour of the French advance, which, accompanied by its adjoining\r\nnations, shall affright the whole world by the single terror of its\r\nname. But why do I delay you longer by detracting from the courage of\r\nthe gentiles? Rather bring to your recollection the saying of God,\r\n‘Narrow is the way which leadeth to life.’ Be it so then: the track to\r\nbe followed is narrow, replete with death, and terrible with dangers;\r\nstill this path will lead to your lost country. No doubt you must, ‘by\r\nmuch tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.’ Place then, before\r\nyour imagination, if you shall be made captive, torments and chains;\r\nnay, every possible suffering that can be inflicted. Expect, for the\r\nfirmness of your faith, even horrible punishments; that so, if it be\r\nnecessary, you may redeem your souls at the expense of your bodies. Do\r\nyou fear death? you men of exemplary courage and intrepidity. Surely\r\nhuman wickedness can devise nothing against you, worthy to be put in\r\ncompetition with heavenly glory: for the sufferings of the present\r\ntime are not worthy to be compared ‘to the glory which shall be\r\nrevealed in us.’ Know ye not, ‘that for men to live is wretchedness,\r\nand happiness to die?’ This doctrine, if you remember, you imbibed\r\nwith your mother’s milk, through the preaching of the clergy: and this\r\ndoctrine your ancestors, the martyrs, held out by example. Death sets\r\nfree from its filthy prison the human soul, which then takes flight for\r\nthe mansions fitted to its virtues. Death accelerates their country\r\nto the good: death cuts short the wickedness of the ungodly. By means\r\nof death, then, the soul, made free, is either soothed with joyful\r\nhope, or is punished without farther apprehension of worse. So long\r\nas it is fettered to the body, it derives from it earthly contagion;\r\nor to say more truly, is dead. For, earthly with heavenly, and divine\r\nwith mortal, ill agree. The soul, indeed, even now, in its state of\r\nunion with the body, is capable of great efforts; it gives life to\r\nits instrument, secretly moving and animating it to exertions almost\r\nbeyond mortal nature. But when, freed from the clog which drags it to\r\nthe earth, it regains its proper station, it partakes of a blessed and\r\nperfect energy, communicating after some measure with the invisibility\r\nof the divine nature. Discharging a double office, therefore, it\r\nministers life to the body when it is present, and the cause of its\r\nchange, when it departs. You must observe how pleasantly the soul wakes\r\nin the sleeping body, and, apart from the senses, sees many future\r\nevents, from the principle of its relationship to the Deity. Why then\r\ndo ye fear death, who love the repose of sleep, which resembles death?\r\nSurely it must be madness, through lust of a transitory life, to deny\r\nyourselves that which is eternal. Rather, my dearest brethren, should\r\nit so happen, lay down your lives for the brotherhood. Rid God’s\r\nsanctuary of the wicked: expel the robbers: bring in the pious. Let\r\nno love of relations detain you; for man’s chiefest love is towards\r\nGod. Let no attachment to your native soil be an impediment; because,\r\nin different points of view, all the world is exile to the Christian,\r\nand all the world his country. Thus exile is his country, and his\r\ncountry exile. Let none be restrained from going by the largeness of\r\nhis patrimony, for a still larger is promised him; not of such things\r\nas soothe the miserable with vain expectation, or flatter the indolent\r\ndisposition with the mean advantages of wealth, but of such as are\r\nshewn by perpetual example and approved by daily experience. Yet these\r\ntoo are pleasant, but vain, and which, to such as despise them, produce\r\nreward a hundred-fold. These things I publish, these I command: and\r\nfor their execution I fix the end of the ensuing spring. God will be\r\ngracious to those who undertake this expedition, that they may have\r\na favourable year, both in abundance of produce, and in serenity of\r\nseason. Those who may die will enter the mansions of heaven; while the\r\nliving shall behold the sepulchre of the Lord. And what can be greater\r\nhappiness, than for a man, in his life-time, to see those places, where\r\nthe Lord of heaven was conversant as a man? Blessed are they, who,\r\ncalled to these occupations, shall inherit such a recompence: fortunate\r\nare those who are led to such a conflict, that they may partake of such\r\nrewards.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1095.] EFFECT OF URBAN’S SPEECH.]\r\n\r\nI have adhered to the tenor of this address, retaining some few things\r\nunaltered, on account of the truth of the remarks, but omitting many.\r\nThe bulk of the auditors were extremely excited, and attested their\r\nsentiments by a shout; pleased with the speech, and inclined to the\r\npilgrimage. And immediately, in presence of the council, some of the\r\nnobility, falling down at the knees of the pope, consecrated themselves\r\nand their property to the service of God. Among these was Aimar, the\r\nvery powerful bishop of Puy, who afterwards ruled the army by his\r\nprudence, and augmented it through his eloquence. In the month of\r\nNovember, then, in which this council was held, each departed to his\r\nhome: and the report of this good resolution soon becoming general,\r\nit gently wafted a cheering gale over the minds of the Christians:\r\nwhich being universally diffused, there was no nation so remote, no\r\npeople so retired, as not to contribute its portion. This ardent love\r\nnot only inspired the continental provinces, but even all who had heard\r\nthe name of Christ, whether in the most distant islands, or savage\r\ncountries. The Welshman left his hunting; the Scot his fellowship with\r\nlice;[379] the Dane his drinking party; the Norwegian his raw fish.\r\nLands were deserted of their husbandmen; houses of their inhabitants;\r\neven whole cities migrated. There was no regard to relationship;\r\naffection to their country was held in little esteem; God alone was\r\nplaced before their eyes. Whatever was stored in granaries, or hoarded\r\nin chambers, to answer the hopes of the avaricious husbandman, or the\r\ncovetousness of the miser, all, all was deserted; they hungered and\r\nthirsted after Jerusalem alone. Joy attended such as proceeded; while\r\ngrief oppressed those who remained. But why do I say remained? You\r\nmight see the husband departing with his wife, indeed, with all his\r\nfamily; you would smile to see the whole household laden on a carriage,\r\nabout to proceed on their journey.[380] The road was too narrow for the\r\npassengers, the path too confined for the travellers, so thickly were\r\nthey thronged with endless multitudes. The number surpassed all human\r\nimagination, though the itinerants were estimated at six millions.[381]\r\nDoubtless, never did so many nations unite in one opinion; never did\r\nso immense a population subject their unruly passions to one, and\r\nalmost to no, direction. For the strangest wonder to behold was, that\r\nsuch a countless multitude marched gradually through various Christian\r\ncountries without plundering, though there was none to restrain them.\r\nMutual regard blazed forth in all; so that if any one found in his\r\npossession what he knew did not belong to him, he exposed it everywhere\r\nfor several days to be owned; and the desire of the finder was\r\nsuspended, till perchance the wants of the loser might be repaired.[382]\r\n\r\nThe long-looked for month of March was now at hand, when, the hoary\r\ngarb of winter being laid aside, the world, clad in vernal bloom,\r\ninvited the pilgrims to the confines of the east; nor, such was the\r\nardour of their minds, did they seek delay. Godfrey, duke of Lorraine,\r\nproceeded by way of Hungary: second to none in military virtue, and,\r\ndescended from the ancient lineage of Charles the Great, he inherited\r\nmuch of Charles both in blood and in mind. He was followed by the\r\nFrisons, Lorrainers, Saxons, and all the people who dwell between the\r\nRhine and the Garonne.[383] Raimund, earl of St. Giles, and Aimar,\r\nbishop of Puy, nobly matched in valour, and alike noted for spirit\r\nagainst the enemy and piety to God, took the route of Dalmatia. Under\r\ntheir standard marched the Goths and Gascons, and all the people\r\nscattered throughout the Pyrenees and the Alps. Before them, by a\r\nshorter route, went Boamund, an Apulian by residence, but a Norman by\r\ndescent. For embarking at Brindisi, and landing at Durazzo, he marched\r\nto Constantinople by roads with which he was well acquainted. Under his\r\ncommand, Italy, and the whole adjacent province, from the Tuscan sea\r\nto the Adriatic, joined in the war. All these assembling at the same\r\ntime at Constantinople, partook somewhat of mutual joy. Here, too, they\r\nfound Hugh the Great, brother of Philip, king of France: for having\r\ninconsiderately, and with a few soldiers, entered the territories of\r\nthe emperor, he was taken by his troops, and detained in free custody.\r\nBut Alexius, emperor of Constantinople, alarmed at the arrival of\r\nthese chiefs, willingly, but, as it were, induced by their entreaties,\r\nreleased him. Alexius was a man famed for his duplicity, and never\r\nattempted any thing of importance, unless by stratagem. He had taken\r\noff Guiscard, as I before related, by poison, and had corrupted his\r\nwife by gold; falsely promising by his emissaries to marry her. Again,\r\ntoo, he allowed William, earl of Poitou, to be led into an ambush of\r\nthe Turks, and, after losing sixty thousand soldiers, to escape almost\r\nunattended; being incensed at his reply, when he refused homage to the\r\nGreek. In after time, he laid repeated snares for Boamund, who was\r\nmarching against him to avenge the injuries of the crusaders; and when\r\nthese failed he bereaved him of his brother Guido, and of almost all\r\nhis army; making use of his usual arts either in poisoning the rivers,\r\nor their garments: but of this hereafter. Now, however, removing the\r\narmy from the city, and mildly addressing the chiefs, his Grecian\r\neloquence proved so powerful, that he obtained from them all homage,\r\nand an oath, that they would form no plot against him; and that if they\r\ncould subdue the cities pertaining to his empire, they would restore\r\nthem to him, thus purchasing another’s advantage at the expense of\r\ntheir own blood. The credit of maintaining his liberty appeared more\r\nestimable to Raimund alone; so that he neither did homage to him, nor\r\ntook the oath. Collecting, then, all their forces, they made an attack\r\non Nicea, a city of Bithynia: for they chose to assault this first,\r\nboth as it was an obstacle to the crusaders, and as they were eager to\r\nrevenge the death of those pilgrims who had recently been slain there.\r\nFor one Walter, a distinguished soldier, but precipitate, (for you\r\nwill scarcely see prudence and valour united in the same person, as\r\none retards what the other advances,) incautiously roaming around the\r\nwalls, had perished with a numerous party, which Peter the hermit had\r\nallured, by his preaching, from their country.\r\n\r\nNow, too, in the month of September, Robert earl of Normandy, brother\r\nof king William whose name is prefixed to this book, earnestly desiring\r\nto enter on the expedition, had as his companions Robert of Flanders,\r\nand Stephen of Blois who had married his sister. They were earls of\r\nnoble lineage and corresponding valour. Under their command were the\r\nEnglish and Normans, the Western Franks and people of Flanders, and all\r\nthe tribes which occupy the continental tract from the British Ocean to\r\nthe Alps. Proceeding on their journey, at Lucca they found pope Urban,\r\nwho being enraged at Guibert, as I have said, was, by the assistance\r\nof Matilda, carrying war into Italy and around the city of Rome. He had\r\nnow so far succeeded that the Roman people, inclining to his party,\r\nwere harassing that of Guibert, both by words and blows; nor did the\r\none faction spare the other, either in the churches or in the streets,\r\nuntil Guibert, being weakest, left the see vacant for Urban, and fled\r\nto Germany.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1097.] ANCIENT ROME.]\r\n\r\nOf Rome, formerly the mistress of the globe, but which now, in\r\ncomparison of its ancient state, appears a small town; and of the\r\nRomans, once “Sovereigns over all and the gowned nation,”[384] who are\r\nnow the most fickle of men, bartering justice for gold, and dispensing\r\nwith the canons for money; of this city and its inhabitants, I say,\r\nwhatever I might attempt to write, has been anticipated by the verses\r\nof Hildebert, first, bishop of Mans, and afterwards archbishop of\r\nTours.[385] Which I insert, not to assume the honour acquired by\r\nanother man’s labour, but rather as a proof of a liberal mind, while\r\nnot envying his fame, I give testimony to his charming poetry.\r\n\r\n    Rome, still thy ruins grand beyond compare,\r\n  Thy former greatness mournfully declare,\r\n  Though time thy stately palaces around\r\n  Hath strewed, and cast thy temples to the ground.\r\n  Fall’n is the power, the power Araxes dire\r\n  Regrets now gone, and dreaded when entire;\r\n  Which arms and laws, and ev’n the gods on high\r\n  Bade o’er the world assume the mastery;\r\n  Which guilty Cæsar rather had enjoyed\r\n  Alone, than e’er a fostering hand employed.\r\n  Which gave to foes, to vice, to friends its care,\r\n  Subdued, restrained, or bade its kindness share\r\n  This growing power the holy fathers reared,\r\n  Where near the stream the fav’ring spot appeared\r\n  From either pole, materials, artists meet,\r\n  And rising walls their proper station greet;\r\n  Kings gave their treasures, fav’ring too was fate,\r\n  And arts and riches on the structure wait.\r\n  Fall’n is that city, whose proud fame to reach,\r\n  I merely say, “Rome was,” there fails my speech.\r\n  Still neither time’s decay, nor sword, nor fire,\r\n  Shall cause its beauty wholly to expire.\r\n  Human exertions raised that splendid Rome,\r\n  Which gods in vain shall strive to overcome.\r\n  Bid wealth, bid marble, and bid fate attend,\r\n  And watchful artists o’er the labour bend,\r\n  Still shall the matchless ruin art defy\r\n  The old to rival, or its loss supply.\r\n  Here gods themselves their sculptur’d forms admire,\r\n  And only to reflect those forms aspire;\r\n  Nature unable such like gods to form,\r\n  Left them to man’s creative genius warm;\r\n  Life breathes within them, and the suppliant falls,\r\n  Not to the God, but statues in the walls.\r\n  City thrice blessed! were tyrants but away,\r\n  Or shame compelled them justice to obey.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1097.] DESCRIPTION OF ROME.]\r\n\r\nAre not these sufficient to point out in such a city, both the dignity\r\nof its former advantages, and the majesty of its present ruin? But that\r\nnothing may be wanting to its honour, I will add the number of its\r\ngates, and the multitude of its sacred relics; and that no person may\r\ncomplain of his being deprived of any knowledge by the obscurity of the\r\nnarrative, the description shall run in an easy and familiar style.[386]\r\n\r\nThe first is the Cornelian gate, which is now called the gate of\r\nSt. Peter, and the Cornelian way. Near it is situated the church of\r\nSt. Peter, in which his body lies, decked with gold and silver, and\r\nprecious stones: and no one knows the number of the holy martyrs who\r\nrest in that church. On the same way is another church, in which lie\r\nthe holy virgins Rufina and Secunda. In a third church, are Marius and\r\nMartha, and Audifax and Abacuc, their sons.\r\n\r\nThe second is the Flaminian gate, which is now called the gate of St.\r\nValentine,[387] and the Flaminian way, and when it arrives at the\r\nMilvian bridge, it takes the name of the Ravennanian way, because it\r\nleads to Ravenna; and there, at the first stone without the gate, St.\r\nValentine rests in his church.\r\n\r\nThe third is called the Porcinian[388] gate, and the way the same; but\r\nwhere it joins the Salarian, it loses its name, and there, nearly in\r\nthe spot which is called Cucumeris, lie the martyrs, Festus, Johannes,\r\nLiberalis, Diogenes, Blastus, Lucina, and in one sepulchre, the Two\r\nHundred and Sixty,[389] in another, the Thirty.\r\n\r\nThe fourth is the Salarian[390] gate and way; now called St.\r\nSilvester’s. Here, near the road, lie St. Hermes, and St. Vasella,\r\nand Prothus, and Jacinctus, Maxilian, Herculan, Crispus; and, in\r\nanother place, hard by, rest the holy martyrs Pamphilus and Quirinus,\r\nseventy steps beneath the surface. Next is the church of St. Felicity,\r\nwhere she rests, and Silanus her son; and not far distant, Boniface\r\nthe martyr. In another church, there are Crisantus, and Daria, and\r\nSaturninus, and Maurus, and Jason, and their mother Hilaria, and others\r\ninnumerable. And in another church, St. Alexander, Vitalis, Martialis,\r\nsons of St. Felicity; and seven holy virgins, Saturnina, Hilarina,\r\nDuranda, Rogantina, Serotina, Paulina, Donata. Next the church of\r\nSt. Silvester, where he lies under a marble tomb; and the martyrs,\r\nCelestinus, Philippus, and Felix; and there too, the Three Hundred and\r\nSixty-five martyrs rest in one sepulchre; and near them lie Paulus and\r\nCrescentianus, Prisca and Semetrius, Praxides and Potentiana.\r\n\r\nThe fifth is called the Numentan[391] gate. There lies St. Nicomede,\r\npriest and martyr; the way too is called by the same name. Near the\r\nroad are the church and body of St. Agnes; in another church, St.\r\nErmerenciana, and the martyrs, Alexander, Felix, Papias; at the seventh\r\nstone on this road rests the holy pope Alexander, with Euentius and\r\nTheodolus.\r\n\r\nThe sixth is the Tiburtine[392] gate and way, which is now called\r\nSt. Lawrence’s: near this way lies St. Lawrence in his church, and\r\nHabundius the martyr: and near this, in another church, rest these\r\nmartyrs, Ciriaca, Romanus, Justinus, Crescentianus; and not far from\r\nhence the church of St. Hyppolitus, where he himself rests, and his\r\nfamily, eighteen in number; there too repose, St. Trifonia, the wife\r\nof Decius, and his daughter Cirilla, and her nurse Concordia. And in\r\nanother part of this way is the church of Agapit the martyr.\r\n\r\nThe seventh is called, at present, the Greater gate,[393] formerly the\r\nSeracusan, and the way the Lavicanian, which leads to St. Helena. Near\r\nthis are Peter, Marcellinus, Tyburtius, Geminus, Gorgonius, and the\r\nForty Soldiers,[394] and others without number; and a little farther\r\nthe Four Coronati.[395]\r\n\r\nThe eighth is the gate of St. John,[396] which by the ancients was\r\ncalled Assenarica. The ninth gate is called Metrosa;[397] and in\r\nfront of both these runs the Latin way. The tenth is called the\r\nLatin gate,[398] and way. Near this, in one church, lie the martyrs,\r\nGordianus and Epimachus, Sulpicius, Servilianus, Quintinus, Quartus,\r\nSophia, Triphenus. Near this too, in another spot, Tertullinus, and\r\nnot far distant, the church of St. Eugenia, in which she lies, and her\r\nmother Claudia, and pope Stephen, with nineteen of his clergy, and\r\nNemesius the deacon.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh is called the Appian gate[399] and way. There lie St.\r\nSebastian, and Quirinus, and originally the bodies of the apostles\r\nrested there. A little nearer Rome, are the martyrs, Januarius,\r\nUrbanus, Xenon, Quirinus, Agapetus, Felicissimus; and in another\r\nchurch, Tyburtius, Valerianus, Maximus. Not far distant is the church\r\nof the martyr Cecilia; and there are buried Stephanus, Sixtus,\r\nZefferinus, Eusebius, Melchiades, Marcellus, Eutychianus, Dionysius,\r\nAntheros, Pontianus, pope Lucius, Optacius, Julianus, Calocerus,\r\nParthenius, Tharsicius, Politanus, martyrs: there too is the church\r\nand body of St. Cornelius: and in another church, St. Sotheris: and\r\nnot far off, rest the martyrs, Hippolytus, Adrianus, Eusebius, Maria,\r\nMartha, Paulina, Valeria, Marcellus, and near, pope Marcus in his\r\nchurch. Between the Appian and Ostiensian way, is the Ardeatine way,\r\nwhere are St. Marcus, and Marcellianus. And there lies pope Damasus in\r\nhis church; and near him St. Petronilla, and Nereus, and Achilleus, and\r\nmany more.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth gate and way is called the Ostiensian, but, at present, St.\r\nPaul’s,[400] because he lies near it in his church. There too is the\r\nmartyr Timotheus: and near, in the church of St. Tecla, are the martyrs\r\nFelix, Audactus, and Nemesius. At the Three Fountains[401] is the head\r\nof the martyr St. Anastasius.\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth is called the Portuan[402] gate and way; near which in\r\na church are the martyrs, Felix, Alexander, Abdon and Sennes, Symeon,\r\nAnastasius, Polion, Vincentius, Milex, Candida, and Innocentia.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth is the Aurelian[403] gate and way, which now is called\r\nthe gate of St. Pancras, because he lies near it in his church, and\r\nthe other martyrs, Paulinus, Arthemius, St. Sapientia, with her three\r\ndaughters, Faith, Hope, and Charity. In another church, Processus and\r\nMartinianus; and, in a third, two Felixes; in a fourth Calixtus, and\r\nCalepodius; in a fifth St. Basilides. At the twelfth milliary within\r\nthe city, on Mount Celius, are the martyrs Johannes, and Paulus, in\r\ntheir dwelling, which was made a church after their martyrdom: and\r\nCrispin and Crispinianus, and St. Benedicta. On the same mount, is\r\nthe church of St. Stephen, the first martyr; and there are buried the\r\nmartyrs Primus, and Felicianus; on Mount Aventine St. Boniface; and on\r\nMount Nola, St. Tatiana rests.\r\n\r\nSuch are the Roman sanctuaries; such the sacred pledges upon earth: and\r\nyet in the midst of this heavenly treasure, as it were, a people drunk\r\nwith senseless fury, even at the very time the crusaders arrived, were\r\ndisturbing everything with wild ambition, and, when unable to satisfy\r\ntheir lust of money, pouring out the blood of their fellow citizens\r\nover the very bodies of the saints.[404] The earls, confiding then in\r\nUrban’s benediction, having passed through Tuscany and Campania, came\r\nby Apulia to Calabria, and would have embarked immediately had not the\r\nseamen, on being consulted, forbade them, on account of the violence\r\nof the southerly winds. In consequence, the earls of Normandy and\r\nBlois passed the winter there; sojourning each among their friends, as\r\nconvenient. The earl of Flanders, alone, ventured to sea, experiencing\r\na prosperous issue to a rash attempt: wherefore part of this assembled\r\nmultitude returned home through want; and part of them died from the\r\nunwholesomeness of the climate. The earls who remained however, when\r\nby the vernal sun’s return they saw the sea sufficiently calm for\r\nthe expedition, committed themselves to the ocean, and, by Christ’s\r\nassistance, landed safely at two ports. Thence, through Thessaly,\r\nthe metropolis of which is Thessalonica, and Thracia, they came to\r\nConstantinople. Many of the lower order perished on the march through\r\ndisease and want; many lost their lives at the Devil’s Ford, as it is\r\ncalled from its rapidity; and more indeed would have perished, had\r\nnot the advanced cavalry been stationed in the river, to break the\r\nviolence of the current; by which means the lives of some were saved,\r\nand the rest passed over on horseback. The whole multitude then, to\r\nsolace themselves for their past labours, indulged in rest for fifteen\r\ndays, pitching their camp in the suburbs of the city; of which, as the\r\nopportunity has presented itself, I shall briefly speak.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1097.] CONSTANTINOPLE--ITS ORIGIN.]\r\n\r\nConstantinople was first called Byzantium: which name is still\r\npreserved by the imperial money called Bezants. St. Aldhelm, in his\r\nbook On Virginity,[405] relates that it changed its appellation by\r\ndivine suggestion: his words are as follow. As Constantine was sleeping\r\nin this city, he imagined that there stood before him an old woman,\r\nwhose forehead was furrowed with age; but, that presently, clad in an\r\nimperial robe, she became transformed into a beautiful girl, and so\r\nfascinated his eyes, by the elegance of her youthful charms, that he\r\ncould not refrain from kissing her: that Helena, his mother, being\r\npresent, then said, “She shall be yours for ever; nor shall she die,\r\ntill the end of time.” The solution of this dream, when he awoke, the\r\nemperor extorted from heaven, by fasting and almsgiving. And behold,\r\nwithin eight days, being cast again into a deep sleep, he thought\r\nhe saw pope Silvester, who died some little time before, regarding\r\nhis convert[406] with complacency, and saying, “You have acted with\r\nyour customary prudence, in waiting for a solution, from God, of that\r\nenigma which was beyond the comprehension of man. The old woman you\r\nsaw, is this city, worn down by age, whose time-struck walls, menacing\r\napproaching ruin, require a restorer. But you, renewing its walls, and\r\nits affluence, shall signalize it also with your name; and here shall\r\nthe imperial progeny reign for ever. You shall not, however, lay the\r\nfoundations at your own pleasure; but mounting the horse on which,\r\nwhen in the novitiate of your faith, you rode round the churches of\r\nthe apostles at Rome, you shall give him the rein, and liberty to\r\ngo whither he please: you shall have, too, in your hand, your royal\r\nspear,[407] whose point shall describe the circuit of the wall on the\r\nground. You will be regulated, therefore, in what manner to dispose the\r\nfoundations of the wall by the track of the spear on the earth.”\r\n\r\nThe emperor eagerly obeyed the vision, and built a city equal to\r\nRome; alleging that the emperor ought not to reign in Rome, where the\r\nmartyred apostles, from the time of Christ, held dominion. He built\r\nin it two churches, one of which was dedicated to peace; the other to\r\nthe apostles; bringing thither numerous bodies of saints, who might\r\nconciliate the assistance of God against the incursions of its enemies.\r\nHe placed in the circus, for the admiration and ornament of the city,\r\nthe statues of triumphal heroes, brought from Rome, and the tripods\r\nfrom Delphi; and the images of heathen deities to excite the contempt\r\nof the beholders. They relate that it was highly gratifying to the mind\r\nof the emperor, to receive a mandate from heaven, to found a city in\r\nthat place, where the fruitfulness of the soil, and the temperature\r\nof the atmosphere conduced to the health of its inhabitants: for as\r\nhe was born in Britain,[408] he could not endure the burning heat of\r\nthe sun. But Thracia is a province of Europe, as the poets observe,\r\nextremely cool, “From Hebrus’ ice, and the Bistonian north;” and near\r\nto Mœsia, where, as Virgil remarks, “With wonder Gargara the harvest\r\nsees.”[409] Constantinople, then, washed by the sea, obtains the\r\nmingled temperature both of Europe and of Asia; because, from a short\r\ndistance, the Asiatic east tempers the severity of the northern blast.\r\nThe city is surrounded by a vast extent of walls, yet the influx of\r\nstrangers is so great, as to make it crowded. In consequence they\r\nform a mole in the sea, by throwing in masses of rock, and loads of\r\nsand; and the space obtained by this new device, straitens the ancient\r\nwaters. The sea wonders to see fields unknown before, amid its glassy\r\nwaves; and surrounds and supplies its city with all the conveniences of\r\nthe earth. The town is encompassed on every side, except the north, by\r\nthe ocean, and is full of angles in the circuit of its walls, where it\r\ncorresponds with the windings of the sea; which walls contain a space\r\nof twenty miles in circumference. The Danube,[410] which is likewise\r\ncalled the Ister, flows in hidden channels under ground, into the city;\r\nand on certain days being let out by the removal of a plug, it carries\r\noff the filth of the streets into the sea. All vied with the emperor in\r\nnoble zeal to give splendour to this city, each thinking he was bound\r\nto advance the work in hand: one contributing holy relics, another\r\nriches, Constantine all things.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1097.] EMPERORS OF CONSTANTINOPLE.]\r\n\r\nAfter Constantine the Great, the following emperors reigned here.\r\nConstantine his son; Julian the Apostate; Jovinian, Valens, Theodosius\r\nthe Great; Arcadius, Theodosius the Younger; Marchianus, Leo the First;\r\nZeno, Anastasius, Justin the Great; Justinian, who, famed for his\r\nliterature and his wars, built a church in Constantinople to Divine\r\nWisdom; that is, to the Lord Jesus Christ, which he called Hagia\r\nSophia; a work, as they report, surpassing every other edifice in\r\nthe world, and where ocular inspection proves it superior to its most\r\npompous descriptions: Justin the Younger; Tiberius, Mauricius, the\r\nfirst Greek; Focas, Heraclius, Heracleonas, Constans, Constantine, the\r\nson of Heraclius; who, coming to Rome, and purloining all the remains\r\nof ancient decoration, stripped the churches even of their brazen\r\ntiles, anxiously wishing for triumphal honours, at Constantinople,\r\neven from such spoils as these; his covetousness, however, turned out\r\nunfortunately for him, for being shortly after killed at Syracuse, he\r\nleft all these honourable spoils to be conveyed to Alexandria by the\r\nSaracens; Constantine, Leo the Second; Justinian, again Justinian,\r\nTiberius, Anastasius, Philippicus, Theodosius, Leo the Third; all\r\nthese reigned both at Constantinople and at Rome: the following in\r\nConstantinople only; Constantine, Leo, Constantine, Nicephorus,\r\nStauratius, Michael, Theophilus, Michael, Basilius, Leo, Alexander,\r\nConstantine, two Romanuses, Nicephorus, Focas, Johannes, Basilius,\r\nRomanus, Michael, Constantine, Theodora the empress, Michael, Sachius,\r\nConstantine, Romanus, Diogenes, Nicephorus, Buthanus, Michael;[411]\r\nwho, driven from the empire by Alexius, secretly fled to Guiscard\r\nin Apulia, and surrendering to him his power, imagined he had done\r\nsomething prejudicial to Alexius: hence Guiscard’s ambition conceived\r\ngreater designs; falsely persuading himself that he might acquire by\r\nindustry, what the other had lost by inactivity: how far he succeeded,\r\nthe preceding book hath explained. In the same city is the cross of\r\nour Saviour, brought by Helena from Jerusalem. There too rest the\r\napostles, Andrew, James the brother of our Lord; Matthias: the prophets\r\nElizeus, Daniel, Samuel, and many others: Luke the Evangelist: martyrs\r\ninnumerable: confessors, Johannes Chrysostom, Basilius, Gregorious\r\nNazianzen, Spiridion: virgins, Agatha, Lucia; and lastly all the saints\r\nwhose bodies the emperors were able to collect thither out of every\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1097.] SIEGE OF NICE.]\r\n\r\nThe earls, then, of Normandy and Blois, did homage to the Greek. For\r\nthe earl of Flanders had already passed on, disdaining to perform this\r\nceremony, from the recollection that he was freely born and educated.\r\nThe others, giving and receiving promises of fidelity, proceeded in\r\nthe first week of June to Nice, which the rest had already besieged\r\nfrom the middle of May. Uniting, therefore, their forces, much carnage\r\nensued on either side; since every kind of weapon could easily be\r\nhurled by the townsmen on those who were beneath them; and the arm\r\neven of the weakest had effect on persons crowded together. Moreover\r\nthe Turks dragged up, with iron hooks, numberless dead bodies of our\r\npeople, to mangle them in mockery; or to cast them down again when\r\nstripped of their raiment. The Franks were grieved at this: nor did\r\nthey cease venting their rage by slaughter, till the Turks, wearied by\r\nextremity of suffering, on the day of the summer solstice, surrendered\r\nthemselves to the emperor by means of secret messengers. He, who knew\r\nonly how to consult his own advantage, gave orders to the Franks to\r\ndepart: choosing rather, that the city should be reserved for the\r\nundisguised disloyalty of the Turks, than the distrusted power of\r\nthe Franks. He ordered, however, silver and gold to be distributed\r\nto the chiefs, and copper coin to those of inferior rank, lest they\r\nshould complain of being unrewarded. Thus the Turks, who, passing\r\nthe Euphrates, had now for the space of fifty years been possessed\r\nof Bithynia, which is a part of Asia Minor that is called Romania,\r\nbetook themselves to flight to the eastward. Nevertheless, when the\r\nsiege was ended, they attempted, at the instigation of Soliman,[412]\r\nwho had been sovereign of all Romania, to harass the army on its\r\nadvance. This man collecting, as is computed, three hundred and sixty\r\nthousand archers, attacked our people, expecting anything rather than\r\nhostility, with such violence, that overwhelmed with an iron shower\r\nof arrows, they were terrified and turned their backs. At that time,\r\nby chance, duke Godfrey and Hugh the Great, and Raimund, had taken\r\nanother route, that they might plunder the enemies’ country to a wider\r\nextent, and obtain forage with more facility. But the Norman, sensible\r\nof his extreme danger, by means of expeditious messengers on a safe\r\ntrack, acquainted Godfrey and the rest of the approach of the Turks.\r\nThey without a moment’s delay, turned against the enemy, and delivered\r\ntheir associates from danger. For these were now indiscriminately\r\nslaughtered in their tents, unprepared for resistance, and filling\r\nthe air with prayers and lamentations. Nor did the enemy take any\r\nparticular aim, but trusting his arrows to the wind, he never, from\r\nthe thickness of the ranks, drew his bow in vain. What alone retarded\r\ndestruction was, that the attack took place near a thicket of canes,\r\nwhich prevented the Turks from riding full speed. At length, however,\r\nperceiving the advanced guard of the approaching chiefs, the Christians\r\nleft the thicket, and shouting the military watch-word, “It is the\r\nwill of God,”[413] they attack the scattered ranks of the enemy,\r\nmaking a signal to their companions, at the same time to assail them\r\nin the rear. Thus the Turks, pressed on either side, forthwith fled,\r\nshrieking with a dreadful cry, and raising a yell which reached the\r\nclouds. Nor had they recourse to their customary practice of a flying\r\nbattle, but throwing down their bows, they manifested, by a flight of\r\nthree successive days, something greater than mere human apprehension.\r\nNor was there, indeed, any person to follow them; for our horses,\r\nscarce able to support life on the barren turf, were unequal to a\r\nvigorous pursuit: showing immediately their want of strength by their\r\npanting sides. Asia was formerly, it is true, a land most fruitful\r\nin corn; but, both in distant and in recent times, it had been so\r\nplundered by the savage Turks, that it could scarcely suffice for the\r\nmaintenance of a small army, much less of a multitude, so vast as to\r\nthreaten devouring whole harvests and drinking rivers dry. For, when\r\nthey departed from Nice, they were still estimated at seven hundred\r\nthousand: of the remainder, part had been wasted by the sword, part by\r\nsickness, and still more had deserted to their homes.\r\n\r\nThence, then, they arrived at Heraclea by the route of Antioch and\r\nIconium, cities of Pisidia. Here they beheld in the sky a portent\r\nfashioned like a flaming sword; the point of which extended towards the\r\neast. All the period from the kalends of July, when they left Nice,\r\ntill the nones of October, had elapsed when they arrived at Antioch\r\nin Syria. The situation of this city, I should describe, had not my\r\nwish in this respect been anticipated by the eloquence of Ambrosius in\r\nHegesippus:[414] were I not also fearful, that I may be blamed for the\r\nperpetual digressions of my narrative. Still, however, I will relate so\r\nmuch as the labour I have undertaken seems to require.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1097.] SIEGE OF ANTIOCH.]\r\n\r\nAntioch, which was named after his father, Antiochus, by Seleucus,\r\nking of Asia, is surrounded with a vast wall, which even contains a\r\nmountain within it. Next to Rome, and Constantinople, and Alexandria,\r\nit obtains precedence over the cities of the world. It is secure\r\nby its walls, lofty from its situation; and if ever taken, must be\r\ngained more by ingenuity than force. The nearest river to it, which\r\nI learn is now called Fervus, though originally Orontes, falls into\r\nthe sea twelve miles from the city; its tide impetuous, and growing\r\ncolder from its violence, ministers to the health of the inhabitants\r\nby its effect on the atmosphere. Capable too of receiving supplies by\r\nshipping for the service of its citizens, it can at all times mock the\r\nperseverance of its besiegers. Here the venerable title of Christian\r\nwas first conceived: hence, first St. Paul, the spring and spur of this\r\nreligion, went forth to preach; here the first pontific seat was filled\r\nby St. Peter; in honour to whom the church there founded remained\r\nuninjured through the whole domination of the Turks: and equally also\r\ndid another, consecrated in honour of St. Mary, strike the eyes of\r\nbeholders with its beauty, exciting wonder that they should reverence\r\nthe church of him whose faith they persecuted.\r\n\r\nThis city, then, the Franks invested from October till June;[415]\r\npitching their tents around the walls after they had passed the river.\r\nForeseeing, however, the difficulty of taking it, and judging it\r\nexpedient to provide against the cowardice of certain of their party,\r\nthe chiefs, in common, took an oath, that they would not desist from\r\nthe siege till the city should be taken by force or by stratagem. And,\r\nthat they might more easily complete their design, they built many\r\nfortresses on this side of the river, in which soldiers were placed to\r\nkeep guard. Aoxianus, too, the governor of the city, observing that the\r\nFranks acted neither jestingly nor coldly, but set heartily to besiege\r\nit, sent his son Sansadol to the Sultan, emperor of Persia, to make\r\nknown the boldness of the Franks, and to implore assistance. Sultan\r\namong the Persians implies the same as Augustus among the Romans:\r\nCommander of all the Saracens, and of the whole east. I imagine this\r\nempire has continued so long, and still increases, because the people,\r\nas I have related, are unwarlike; and being deficient in active blood,\r\nknow not how to cast off slavery, when once admitted; not being aware,\r\nas Lucan says,[416] that\r\n\r\n  “Arms were bestowed that men should not be slaves.”\r\n\r\nBut the western nations, bold and fierce, disdain long-continued\r\nsubjugation to any people whatever; often delivering themselves from\r\nservitude, and imposing it on others. Moreover, the Roman empire first\r\ndeclined to the Franks, and after to the Germans: the eastern continues\r\never with the Persians.\r\n\r\nSansadol therefore being despatched to the chief of this empire,\r\nhastened his course with youthful ardour, while his father was by no\r\nmeans wanting to the duties of a commander, in the protection of the\r\ncity. The valour of the besieged was not content merely to defend their\r\nown party, but voluntarily harassed ours; frequently and suddenly\r\nattacking them when foraging or marketing: for, making a bridge of the\r\nvessels they found there, they had established a mart beyond the river.\r\nThrough Christ’s assistance, therefore, becoming resolute, they seized\r\ntheir arms, and boldly repelled their enemies, so that they never\r\nsuffered them to reap the honour of the day. To revenge this disgrace,\r\nthe Turks wreaked their indignation on the Syrian and Armenian\r\ninhabitants of the city; throwing, by means of their balistæ[417] and\r\npetraries, the heads of those whom they had slain into the camp of the\r\nFranks, that by such means they might wound their feelings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1097.] ANTIOCH SURRENDERED.]\r\n\r\nAnd now, everything which could be procured for food being destroyed\r\naround the city, a sudden famine, which usually makes even fortresses\r\ngive way, began to oppress the army; so much so, that the harvest not\r\nhaving yet attained to maturity, some persons seized the pods of beans\r\nbefore they were ripe, as the greatest delicacy: others fed on carrion,\r\nor hides soaked in water; others passed parboiled[418] thistles through\r\ntheir bleeding jaws into their stomachs. Others sold mice, or such\r\nlike dainties, to those who required them; content to suffer hunger\r\nthemselves, so that they could procure money. Some, too, there were,\r\nwho even fed their corpse-like bodies with other corpses, eating human\r\nflesh; but at a distance, and on the mountains, lest others should be\r\noffended at the smell of their cookery. Many wandered through unknown\r\npaths, in expectation of meeting with sustenance, and were killed by\r\nrobbers acquainted with the passes. But not long after the city was\r\nsurrendered.\r\n\r\nFor Boamund, a man of superior talents, had, by dint of very great\r\npromises, induced a Turkish chief,[419] who had the custody of the\r\nprincipal tower, on the side where his station lay, to deliver it up\r\nto him. And he, too, to palliate the infamy of his treachery by a\r\ncompetent excuse, gave his son as an hostage to Boamund; professing\r\nthat he did so by the express command of Christ, which had been\r\ncommunicated to him in a dream. Boamund, therefore, advanced his troops\r\nto the tower, having first, by a secret contrivance, obtained from the\r\nchiefs the perpetual government of the city, in case he could carry it.\r\nThus the Franks, in the dead of the night, scaling the walls by rope\r\nladders, and displaying on the top of the tower the crimson standard\r\nof Boamund, repeated with joyful accents the Christian watchword, “It\r\nis the will of God! It is the will of God!” The Turks awaking, and\r\nheavy from want of rest, took to flight through narrow passages; and\r\nour party, following with drawn swords, made dreadful slaughter of\r\nthe enemy. In this flight fell Aoxianus, governor of the city, being\r\nbeheaded by a certain Syrian peasant: his head, when brought to the\r\nFranks, excited both their laughter and their joy.\r\n\r\nNot long rejoicing in this complete victory, they had the next day to\r\nlament being themselves besieged by the Turks from without. For the\r\nforces which had been solicited by Sansadol were now arrived under the\r\ncommand of Corbaguath, an eastern satrap, who had obtained from the\r\nemperor of Persia three hundred thousand men,[420] under twenty-seven\r\ncommanders. Sixty thousand of these ascended over the rocks to the\r\ncitadel, by desire of the Turks, who still remained in possession of\r\nit. These woefully harassed the Christians by frequent sallies: nor\r\nwas there any hope left, but from the assistance of God, since want\r\nwas now added to the miseries of war--want, the earliest attendant on\r\ngreat calamities. Wherefore, after a fast of three days, and earnest\r\nsupplications, Peter the hermit was sent ambassador to the Turks, who\r\nspake with his usual eloquence to the following effect: “That the Turks\r\nshould now voluntarily evacuate the Christian territory, which they had\r\nformerly unjustly invaded; that it was but right, as the Christians\r\ndid not attack Persia, that the Turks should not molest Asia; that\r\nthey should therefore, either by a voluntary departure, seek their own\r\ncountry, or expect an attack on the following morning; that they might\r\ntry their fortune, by two, or four, or eight, that danger might not\r\naccrue to the whole army.”\r\n\r\nCorbaguath condescended not to honour the messenger even with a reply;\r\nbut playing at chess and gnashing his teeth, dismissed him as he came;\r\nmerely observing, “that the pride of the Franks was at an end.” Hastily\r\nreturning, Peter apprised the army of the insolence of the Turk. Each\r\nthen animating the other, it was publicly ordered, that every person\r\nshould, that night, feed his horse as plentifully as possible, lest\r\nhe should falter from the various evolutions of the following day.\r\nAnd now the morning dawned, when, drawn up in bodies, they proceeded,\r\nwith hostile standard, against the enemy. The first band was led by\r\nthe two Roberts, of Normandy and Flanders, and Hugh the Great; the\r\nsecond by Godfrey; the third by the bishop of Puy; the reserve by\r\nBoamund, as a support to the rest. Raimund continued in the city, to\r\ncover the retreat of our party, in case it should be necessary. The\r\nTurks, from a distance, observing their movements, were, at first,\r\ndubious what they could mean. Afterwards, recognizing the standard of\r\nthe bishop, for they were extremely afraid of him, as they said he was\r\nthe pope of the Christians and the fomenter of the war; and seeing our\r\npeople advancing so courageously and quickly, they fled ere they were\r\nattacked. Our party, too, exhilarated with unexpected joy, slew them as\r\nthey were flying, as far as the strength of the infantry, or exertion\r\nof the cavalry, would permit. They imagined, moreover, that they saw\r\nthe ancient martyrs, who had formerly been soldiers, and who had gained\r\neternal remuneration by their death, I allude to George and Demetrius,\r\nhastily approaching with upraised banner from the mountainous\r\ndistricts, hurling darts against the enemy, but assisting the Franks.\r\nNor is it to be denied, that the martyrs did assist the Christians,\r\nas the angels formerly did the Maccabees, fighting for the self-same\r\ncause. Returning, then, to the spoil, they found in their camp\r\nsufficient to satisfy, or even totally to glut, the covetousness of the\r\ngreediest army. This battle took place A.D. 1098, on the fourth before\r\nthe kalends of July; for the city had been taken the day before the\r\nnones of June. Soon after, on the kalends of the ensuing August, the\r\nbishop of Puy, the leader of the Christians, and chief author of this\r\nlaudable enterprise, joyfully yielded to the common lot of mortals; and\r\nHugh the Great, by permission of the chiefs, as it is said, returned to\r\nFrance, alleging as a reason, the perpetual racking of his bowels.\r\n\r\nBut when, by a long repose of seven months at Antioch, they had\r\nobliterated the memory of their past labours, they began to think of\r\nproceeding on their route. And first of all Raimund, ever unconscious\r\nof sloth, ever foremost in military energy; and next to him the two\r\nRoberts, and Godfrey, proceeded upon the march. Boamund alone, for a\r\ntime, deferred his advance, lured by the prospect of a magnificent city\r\nand the love of wealth. A plausible reason, however, lay concealed\r\nbeneath his covetousness, when he alleged, that Antioch ought not to be\r\nexposed to the Turks without a chief, as they would directly attack it.\r\nHe therefore took up his residence in the city; and this harsh governor\r\ndrove Raimund’s followers, who occupied one of the streets, without the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nThe others, however, passing through Tripoli,[421] and Berith, and\r\nTyre, and Sidon, and Accaron, and Caiphas, and Cæsarea of Palestine,\r\nwhere they left the coast to the right hand, came to Ramula; being\r\nkindly received by some of the cities, and signalizing their valour by\r\nthe subjugation of others. For their design was to delay no longer,\r\nas it was now the month of April, and the produce of the earth had\r\nbecome fully ripe. Ramula is a very small city, without walls: if we\r\ncredit report, the place of the martyrdom of St. George; whose church,\r\noriginally founded there, the Turks had somewhat defaced: but at that\r\ntime, through fear of the Franks, they had carried off their property\r\nand retreated to the mountains. The next morning, at early dawn,\r\nTancred, the nephew of Boamund, a man of undaunted courage, and some\r\nothers, taking arms, proceeded to Bethlehem, desirous of exploring\r\nits vicinity. The Syrians of the place, who came out to meet them,\r\nmanifested their joy with weeping earnestness, through apprehension\r\nfor their safety, on account of the smallness of their numbers; for\r\nfew more than a hundred horsemen were of the party. But our people\r\nhaving suppliantly adored the sacred edifice,[422] immediately stretch\r\nanxiously forward towards Jerusalem. The Turks, confident of their\r\nforce, fiercely sallied out, and for some time skirmished with our\r\ntroops, for the whole army had now come up; but they were soon\r\nrepulsed by the exertions of the Franks, and sought security from their\r\nencircling walls.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1099.] APPROACH TO JERUSALEM.]\r\n\r\nThe numbers who have already written on the subject, admonish me to\r\nsay nothing of the situation and disposition of Jerusalem, nor is it\r\nnecessary for my narrative to expatiate on such a field. Almost every\r\nperson is acquainted with what Josephus, Eucherius, and Bede, have\r\nsaid: for who is not aware, that it was called Salem from Melchisedec;\r\nJebus from the Jebusites; Jerusalem from Solomon? Who has not heard\r\nhow often, falling from adverse war, it buried its inhabitants in\r\nits ruins, through the different attacks of Nabugodonosor, of Titus,\r\nor of Adrian? It was this last who rebuilt Jerusalem, called Ælia,\r\nafter his surname, enclosing it with a circular wall, of greater\r\ncompass, that it might embrace the site of the sepulchre of our Lord,\r\nwhich originally stood without: Mount Sion, too, added to the city,\r\nstands eminent as a citadel. It possesses no springs;[423] but water,\r\ncollected in cisterns, prepared for that purpose, supplies the wants of\r\nthe inhabitants: for the site of the city, beginning from the northern\r\nsummit of Mount Sion, has so gentle a declivity, that the rain which\r\nfalls there does not form any mire, but running like rivulets, is\r\nreceived into tanks, or flowing through the streets, augments the brook\r\nKedron. Here is the church of our Lord, and the temple, which they\r\ncall Solomon’s, by whom built is unknown, but religiously reverenced\r\nby the Turks; more especially the church of our Lord, where they\r\ndaily worshipped, and prohibited the Christians from entering, having\r\nplaced there a statue of Mahomet. Here also is a church of elegant\r\nworkmanship, containing the holy sepulchre, built by Constantine the\r\nGreat, and which has never suffered any injury from the enemies of our\r\nfaith, through fear, as I suppose, of being struck by that celestial\r\nfire which brightly shines in lamps, every year, on the Vigil[424]\r\nof Easter. When this miracle had a beginning, or whether it existed\r\nbefore the times of the Saracens, history has left no trace. I have\r\nread in the writings of Bernard[425] the monk, that about two hundred\r\nand fifty years ago, that is, A.D. 870, he went to Jerusalem and saw\r\nthat fire, and was entertained in the Hospital which the most glorious\r\nCharles the Great had there ordered to be built, and where he had\r\ncollected a library at great expense. He relates, that both in Egypt\r\nand in that place, the Christians, under the dominion of the Turks,\r\nenjoyed such security, that if any traveller lost a beast of burden by\r\naccident, in the midst of the high road, he might leave his baggage\r\nand proceed to the nearest city for assistance, and without doubt find\r\nevery thing untouched at his return. Still, from the suspicion that\r\nthey might be spies, no foreign Christian could live there securely,\r\nunless protected by the signet of the emperor of Babylon. The natives\r\npurchased peace from the Turks at the expense of three talents or\r\nbezants annually. But as Bernard mentions the name of Theodosius, the\r\nthen patriarch, this gives me an occasion of enumerating the whole of\r\nthe patriarchs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1099.] PATRIARCHS OF JERUSALEM.]\r\n\r\nJames the brother of our Lord and son of Joseph; Simon son of\r\nCleophas, the cousin of Christ, for Cleophas was the brother of\r\nJoseph; Justus, Zaccheus, Tobias, Benjamin, Johannes, Maccabæus,\r\nPhilip, Seneca, Justus, Levi, Effrem, Jesse, Judas; these fifteen\r\nwere circumcised: Mark, Cassian, Publius, Maximus, Julian, Gaius; who\r\nfirst celebrated Easter and Lent after the Roman manner: Symmachus,\r\nGaius, Julian, Capito, Maximus, Antonius, Valens, Docilianus,\r\nNarcissus, Dius, Germanio, Gordius, Alexander, Mazabanus, Irmeneus,\r\nZabdas, Ermon, Macharius; in his time the Holy Cross was found by\r\nSt. Helena: Cyriacus, Maximus, Cyrillus, who built the church of the\r\nHoly Sepulchre, and of Mount Calvary, and of Bethlehem, and of the\r\nValley of Jehosaphat. All these were called bishops. After them arose\r\nthe patriarchs: Cyrillus the first patriarch; Johannes, Prailius,\r\nJuvenalis,[426] Zacharias, in whose time came Cosdroe[427] king of\r\nPersia to Jerusalem, and destroyed the churches of Judea and Jerusalem,\r\nand slew with his army six and thirty thousand of the Christians:\r\nModestus, who was appointed patriarch by the emperor Heraclius, when\r\nhe returned victorious from Persia: Sophronius, in whose time the\r\nSaracens came and thrust out all the Christians from Jerusalem, except\r\nthe patriarch, whom they suffered to remain out of reverence to his\r\nsanctity: this was the period when the Saracens overran the whole of\r\nEgypt, and Africa, and Judea, and even Spain, and the Balearic Isles.\r\nPart of Spain was wrested from them by Charles the Great, but the\r\nremainder, together with the countries I have enumerated, they have\r\npossessed for nearly five hundred years, down to the present day:\r\nTheodorus,[428] Ilia, Georgius, Thomas, Basilius, Sergius, Salomontes,\r\nTheodosius, whom Bernard relates to have been an abbat, and that he\r\nwas torn from his monastery, which was fifteen miles distant from\r\nJerusalem, and made patriarch of that city: then too they say that\r\nMichael was patriarch in Babylon over Egypt, the patriarchate of\r\nAlexandria being removed thither: Ilia, Sergius, Leonthos, Athanasius,\r\nChristodolus, Thomas, Joseph, Orestes; in his time came Sultan Achim,\r\nthe nephew of the patriarch Orestes, from Babylon, who sent his army to\r\nJerusalem, destroyed all the churches, that is to say, four thousand,\r\nand caused his uncle, the patriarch, to be conveyed to Babylon and\r\nthere slain: Theophilus, Nicephorus: he built the present church of the\r\nHoly Sepulchre, by the favour of Sultan Achim: Sophronius; in his time\r\nthe Turks, coming to Jerusalem, fought with the Saracens, killed them\r\nall, and possessed the city; but the Christians continued there under\r\nthe dominion of the Turks: Cuthimus, Simeon; in whose time came the\r\nFranks and laid siege to Jerusalem, and rescued it from the hands of\r\nthe Turks and of the king of Babylon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1099.] THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM.]\r\n\r\nIn the fourth year, then, of the expedition to Jerusalem, the third\r\nafter the capture of Nice, and the second after that of Antioch, the\r\nFranks laid siege to Jerusalem,--a city well able to repay the toils of\r\nwar, to soothe its labours, and to requite the fondest expectation. It\r\nwas now the seventh day of June, nor were the besiegers apprehensive\r\nof wanting food or drink for themselves, as the harvest was on the\r\nground, and the grapes were ripe upon the vines; the care alone of\r\ntheir cattle distressed them, which, from the nature of the place and\r\nof the season, had no running stream to support them, for the heat of\r\nthe sun had dried up the secret springs of the brook Siloah, which,\r\nat uncertain periods, used to shed abroad its refreshing waters.\r\nThis brook, when at any time swollen with rain, increases that of\r\nKedron; and then passes on, with bubbling current, into the valley\r\nof Jehosaphat. But this is extremely rare; for there is no certain\r\nperiod of its augmentation or decrease. In consequence, the enemy,\r\nsuddenly darting from their caverns, frequently killed our people,\r\nwhen straggling abroad for the purpose of watering the cattle. In the\r\nmeantime the chiefs were each observant at their respective posts,\r\nand Raymond actively employed before the tower of David.[429] This\r\nfortress, defending the city on the west, and strengthened, nearly half\r\nway up, by courses of squared stone soldered with lead, repels every\r\nfear of invaders when guarded by a small party within. As they saw,\r\ntherefore, that the city was difficult to carry on account of the steep\r\nprecipices, the strength of the walls, and the fierceness of the enemy,\r\nthey ordered engines to be constructed. But before this, indeed, on\r\nthe seventh day of the siege, they had tried their fortune by erecting\r\nladders, and hurling swift arrows against their opponents: but, as\r\nthe ladders were few, and perilous to those who mounted them, since\r\nthey were exposed on all sides and nowhere protected from wounds, they\r\nchanged their design. There was one engine which we call the Sow, the\r\nancients, Vinea; because the machine, which is constructed of slight\r\ntimbers, the roof covered with boards and wickerwork, and the sides\r\ndefended with undressed hides, protects those who are within it, who,\r\nafter the manner of a sow, proceed to undermine the foundations of the\r\nwalls. There was another, which, for want of timber, was but a moderate\r\nsized tower, constructed after the manner of houses:[430] they call it\r\nBerefreid: this was intended to equal the walls in height. The making\r\nof this machine delayed the siege, on account of the unskilfulness\r\nof the workmen and the scarcity of the wood. And now the fourteenth\r\nday of July arrived, when some began to undermine the wall with the\r\nsows, others to move forward the tower. To do this more conveniently,\r\nthey took it towards the works in separate pieces, and, putting it\r\ntogether again at such a distance as to be out of bowshot, advanced\r\nit on wheels nearly close to the wall. In the meantime, the slingers\r\nwith stones, the archers with arrows, and the cross-bow-men with\r\nbolts, each intent on his own department, began to press forward and\r\ndislodge their opponents from the ramparts; soldiers, too, unmatched in\r\ncourage, ascend the tower, waging nearly equal war against the enemy\r\nwith missile weapons and with stones. Nor, indeed, were our foes at\r\nall remiss; but trusting their whole security to their valour, they\r\npoured down grease and burning oil upon the tower, and slung stones\r\non the soldiers, rejoicing in the completion of their desires by the\r\ndestruction of multitudes. During the whole of that day the battle was\r\nsuch that neither party seemed to think they had been worsted; on the\r\nfollowing, which was the fifteenth of July, the business was decided.\r\nFor the Franks, becoming more experienced from the event of the attack\r\nof the preceding day, threw faggots flaming with oil on a tower\r\nadjoining the wall, and on the party who defended it, which, blazing by\r\nthe action of the wind, first seized the timber and then the stones,\r\nand drove off the garrison. Moreover the beams which the Turks had left\r\nhanging down from the walls in order that, being forcibly drawn back,\r\nthey might, by their recoil, batter the tower in pieces in case it\r\nshould advance too near, were by the Franks dragged to them, by cutting\r\naway the ropes; and being placed from the engine to the wall, and\r\ncovered with hurdles, they formed a bridge of communication from the\r\nramparts to the tower. Thus what the infidels had contrived for their\r\ndefence became the means of their destruction; for then the enemy,\r\ndismayed by the smoking masses of flame and by the courage of our\r\nsoldiers, began to give way. These advancing on the wall, and thence\r\ninto the city, manifested the excess of their joy by the strenuousness\r\nof their exertions. This success took place on the side of Godfrey\r\nand of the two Roberts; Raymond knew nothing of the circumstance,\r\ntill the cry of the fugitives and the alarm of the people, throwing\r\nthemselves from the walls, who thus met death while flying from it,\r\nacquainted him that the city was taken. On seeing this, he rushed with\r\ndrawn sword on the runaways, and hastened to avenge the injuries of\r\nGod, until he had satiated his own animosity. Moreover, adverting to\r\nthe advantages of quiet for the moment, he sent unhurt to Ascalon five\r\nhundred Ethiopians, who, retreating to the citadel of David, had given\r\nup the keys of the gates under promise of personal safety. There was no\r\nplace of refuge for the Turks, so indiscriminately did the insatiable\r\nrage of the victors sweep away both the suppliant and the resisting.\r\nTen thousand were slain in the temple of Solomon; more were thrown\r\nfrom the tops of the churches, and of the citadel. After this, the\r\ndead bodies were heaped and dissolved into the aery fluid by means of\r\nfire; lest putrifying in the open air, they should pour contagion on\r\nthe heavy atmosphere. The city being thus expiated by the slaughter of\r\nthe infidels, they proceeded with hearts contrite and bodies prostrate\r\nto the sepulchre of the Lord, which they had so long earnestly sought\r\nafter, and for which they had undergone so many labours. By what ample\r\nincense of prayer, they propitiated heaven, or by what repentant tears\r\nthey once again brought back the favour of God, none, I am confident,\r\ncan describe; no, not if the splendid eloquence of the ancients could\r\nrevive or Orpheus himself return; who, as it is said, bent e’en the\r\nlistening rocks to his harmonious strain. Be it imagined then, rather\r\nthan expressed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1099.] CAPTURE OF JERUSALEM.]\r\n\r\nSo remarkable was the example of forbearance exhibited by the chiefs,\r\nthat, neither on that, nor on the following day, did any of them,\r\nthrough lust of spoil, withdraw his mind from following up the\r\nvictory. Tancred alone, beset with ill-timed covetousness, carried off\r\nsome valuable effects from the temple of Solomon; but, afterwards,\r\nreproved by his own conscience, and the address of some other persons,\r\nhe restored, if not the same things, yet such as were of equal\r\nvalue.[431] At that time, if any man, however poor, seized a house, or\r\nriches of any kind, he did not afterwards encounter the brawlings of\r\nthe powerful, but held, what he had once possessed, as his hereditary\r\nright. Without delay, then, Godfrey, that brilliant mirror of Christian\r\nnobility, in which, as in a splendid ceiling,[432] the lustre of every\r\nvirtue was reflected, was chosen king;[433] all, in lively hope,\r\nagreeing, that they could in no wise better consult the advantage of\r\nthe church; deferring, in the meantime, the election of a patriarch,\r\nwho was to be appointed by the determination of the Roman Pontiff.[434]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1099.] BATTLE OF ASCALON.]\r\n\r\nBut the emperor of Babylon, not the city built by Nimrod and enlarged\r\nby Semiramis and now said to be deserted, but that which Cambyses, son\r\nof Cyrus, built in Egypt, on the spot where Taphnis formerly stood:\r\nthe emperor of Babylon, I say, venting his long-conceived indignation\r\nagainst the Franks, sent the commander of his forces, to drive them, as\r\nhe said, out of his kingdom. Hastening to fulfil the command, when he\r\nheard that Jerusalem was taken, he redoubled his diligence, though he\r\nhad by no means been indolent before. The design of the barbarian was\r\nto besiege the Christians in Jerusalem, and after the victory, which\r\nhe, falsely presaging, already obtained in imagination, to destroy\r\nutterly the sepulchre of our Lord. The Christians, who desired nothing\r\nless than again to endure the miseries of a siege, taking courage\r\nthrough God’s assistance, march out of the city towards Ascalon, to\r\noppose the enemy; and carry with them part of the cross of Christ,\r\nwhich a certain Syrian, an inhabitant of Jerusalem, had produced, as\r\nit had been preserved in his house, in succession from father to son.\r\nThis truly was a fortunate and a loyal device, that the secret should\r\nbe all along kept from the Turks. Obtaining moreover a great booty of\r\nsheep and cattle, near Ascalon, they issued a general order, to leave\r\nthe whole of it in the open plain, lest it should be an impediment when\r\nengaging the next morning, as they would have spoil more than enough\r\nif they conquered, so that, free from incumbrance, they might avenge\r\nthe injuries of heaven. In the morning, therefore, as the army was on\r\nits march, you might see, I believe by divine instinct, the cattle\r\nwith their heads erect, proceeding by the side of the soldiers, and\r\nnot to be driven away by any force. The enemy perceiving this at a\r\ndistance, and their sight being dazzled by the rays of the sun, lost\r\ntheir confidence, ere the battle could commence, as they thought the\r\nmultitude of their opponents was countless: yet were they, themselves,\r\nby no means deficient in numbers, and by long exercise, trained to\r\nbattle. They endeavoured therefore to hem in the Franks, who were\r\nproceeding at a slow rate, by dividing their force into two bodies,\r\nand by curving their wings. But the leaders, and more especially\r\nRobert the Norman, who was in the advanced guard, eluding stratagem\r\nby stratagem, or rather cunning by valour, led on their archers and\r\ninfantry, and broke through the centre of the heathens. Moreover the\r\nLorraine cavalry, which was stationed with its commander in the rear,\r\nadvancing by the flanks, prevented their flight, and occupied the whole\r\nplain. Thus the Turks, penetrated in the front, and hemmed in on every\r\nside, were slain at the pleasure of the victors; the remainder escaping\r\nthrough favour of approaching night. Many golden utensils were found\r\nin their camp; many jewels, which, though from their scarcity unknown\r\nin our country, there shine in native splendour. Nor was there ever a\r\nmore joyful victory for the Christians, because they obtained the most\r\nprecious spoil without loss.\r\n\r\nReturning therefore to Jerusalem, when, by a rest of many days,\r\nthey had recruited their strength, some of them, sighing for their\r\nnative country, prepared to return by sea. Godfrey and Tancred only\r\nremained; princes, truly noble, and, to whose glory, posterity, if\r\nit judge rightly, never can set limits: men, who, from the intense\r\ncold of Europe, plunged into the insupportable heat of the East:\r\nprodigal of their own lives, so that they could succour suffering\r\nChristianity. Who, besides the fears of barbarous incursions, in\r\nconstant apprehension from the unwholesomeness of an unknown climate,\r\ndespised the security of rest and of health in their own country; and\r\nalthough very few in number, kept in subjection so many hostile cities\r\nby their reputation and prowess. They were memorable patterns, too,\r\nof trust in God; not hesitating to remain in that climate, where they\r\nmight either suffer from pestilential air, or be slain by the rage of\r\nthe Saracens. Let the celebration of the poets then give way; nor let\r\nancient fiction extol her earliest heroes. No age hath produced aught\r\ncomparable to the fame of these men. For, if the ancients had any\r\nmerit, it vanished after death with the smoke of their funeral pile;\r\nbecause it had been spent, rather on the vapour of earthly reputation,\r\nthan in the acquisition of substantial good. But the utility of these\r\nmen’s valour will be felt, and its dignity acknowledged, as long as\r\nthe world shall continue to revolve, or pure Christianity to flourish.\r\nWhat shall I say of the good order and forbearance of the whole army?\r\nThere was no gluttony; no lewdness, which was not directly corrected\r\nby the authority of the commanders, or the preaching of the bishops.\r\nThere was no wish to plunder as they passed through the territories\r\nof the Christians; no controversy among themselves, which was not\r\neasily settled by the examination of mediators. Wherefore, since the\r\ncommendation of an army so well-ordered redounds to the glory of its\r\nconductors, I will signalize, in my narrative, the exploits and the\r\nadventures of each respective chief; nor will I subtract any thing from\r\nthe truth, as I received it on the faith of my relators. But let no\r\none who has had a fuller knowledge of these events, accuse me of want\r\nof diligence, since we, who are secluded on this side of the British\r\nocean, hear but the faint echo of Asiatic transactions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1099.] GODFREY OF BOUILLON.]\r\n\r\nKing Godfrey takes the lead in my commendation: he was the son of\r\nEustace count of Boulogne, of whom I have spoken in the time of king\r\nEdward, but more ennobled maternally, as by that line he was descended\r\nfrom Charles the Great. For, his mother, named Ida, daughter of the\r\nancient Godfrey duke of Lorraine, had a brother called Godfrey after\r\nhis father, surnamed Bocard. This was at the time when Robert Friso, of\r\nwhom I have spoken above, on the death of Florence, duke of Friesland,\r\nmarried his widow Gertrude; advancing Theodoric, his son-in-law,\r\nto the succession of the duchy. Bocard could not endure this; but\r\nexpelling Friso, subjected the country to his own will. Friso, unable\r\nto revenge himself by war, did it by stratagem; killing Bocard through\r\nthe agency of his Flemings, who drove a weapon into his posteriors, as\r\nhe was sitting for a natural occasion. In this manner the son-in-law\r\nsucceeded to the duchy, by the means of his father-in-law. The wife\r\nof this Godfrey was the marchioness Matilda, mentioned in the former\r\nbook, who on her husband’s death spiritedly retained the duchy, in\r\nopposition to the emperor; more especially in Italy, for of Lorraine\r\nand the hither-countries he got possession. Ida then, as I began to\r\nrelate, animated her son Godfrey with great expectations of getting\r\nthe earldom of Lorraine: for the paternal inheritance had devolved on\r\nEustace her eldest son; the youngest, Baldwin, was yet a boy. Godfrey\r\narriving at a sufficient age to bear arms, dedicated his services to\r\nthe emperor Henry, who is mentioned in the preceding book. Acquiring\r\nhis friendship, therefore, by unremitting exertions, he received\r\nfrom the emperor’s singular liberality the whole of Lorraine as a\r\nrecompence. Hence it arose, that when the quarrel broke out between the\r\npope and Henry, he went with the latter to the siege of Rome; was the\r\nfirst to break through that part of the wall which was assigned for\r\nhis attack, and facilitated the entrance of the besiegers. Being in\r\nextreme perspiration, and panting with heat, he entered a subterraneous\r\nvault which he found in his way, and when he had there appeased the\r\nviolence of his thirst by an excessive draught of wine, he brought on\r\na quartan fever. Others say that he fell a victim to poisoned wine, as\r\nthe Romans, and men of that country, are used to infect whole casks.\r\nOthers report, that a portion of the walls fell to his lot, where the\r\nTiber flowing, exhales destructive vapours in the morning; that by\r\nthis fatal pest, all his soldiers, with the exception of ten, lost\r\ntheir lives; and that himself, losing his nails and his hair, never\r\nentirely recovered. But be it which it might of these, it appears that\r\nhe was never free from a slow fever, until hearing the report of the\r\nexpedition to Jerusalem, he made a vow to go thither, if God would\r\nkindly restore his health. The moment this vow was made, the strength\r\nof the duke revived; so that, recovering apace, he shook disease from\r\nhis limbs, and rising with expanded breast, as it were, from years of\r\ndecrepitude, shone with renovated youth. In consequence, grateful for\r\nthe mercies of God showered down upon him, he went to Jerusalem the\r\nvery first, or among the first; leading a numerous army to the war. And\r\nthough he commanded a hardy and experienced band, yet none was esteemed\r\nreadier to attack, or more efficient in the combat than himself. Indeed\r\nit is known, that, at the siege of Antioch, with a Lorrainian sword,\r\nhe cut asunder a Turk, who had demanded single combat, and that one\r\nhalf of the man lay panting on the ground, while the horse, at full\r\nspeed, carried away the other: so firmly the miscreant sat. Another\r\nalso who attacked him he clave asunder from the neck to the groin,\r\nby taking aim at his head with a sword; nor did the dreadful stroke\r\nstop here, but cut entirely through the saddle, and the back-bone of\r\nthe horse. I have heard a man of veracity relate, that he had seen\r\nwhat I here subjoin: during the siege, a soldier of the duke’s had\r\ngone out to forage; and being attacked by a lion, avoided destruction\r\nfor some time, by the interposition of his shield. Godfrey, grieved\r\nat this sight, transfixed the ferocious animal with a hunting spear.\r\nWounded, and becoming fiercer from the pain, it turned against the\r\nprince with such violence as to hurt his leg with the iron which\r\nprojected from the wound; and had he not hastened with his sword to\r\nrip it up, this pattern of valour must have perished by the tusk of a\r\nwild beast. Renowned from these successes, he was exalted to be king\r\nof Jerusalem, more especially because he was conspicuous in rank and\r\ncourage without being arrogant. His dominion was small and confined,\r\ncontaining, besides the few surrounding towns, scarcely any cities. For\r\nthe king’s bad state of health, which attacked him immediately after\r\nthe Babylonish war, caused a cessation of warlike enterprise; so that\r\nhe made no acquisitions: yet, by able management, he so well restrained\r\nthe avidity of the barbarians for the whole of that year, that nothing\r\nwas lost. They report that the king, from being unused to a state of\r\nindolence, fell again into his original fever; but I conjecture,\r\nthat God, in his own good time, chose early to translate, to a better\r\nkingdom, a soul rendered acceptable to him and tried by so many\r\nlabours, lest wickedness should change his heart, or deceit beguile\r\nhis understanding. Revolving time thus completing a reign of one year,\r\nhe died placidly, and was buried on Mount Golgotha;[435] a king as\r\nunconquerable in death, as he had formerly been in battle; often kindly\r\nrepressing the tears of the by-standers. Being asked who was to succeed\r\nhim, he mentioned no person by name, but said merely, “whoever was most\r\nworthy.” He never would wear the ensign of royalty, saying, “it was too\r\ngreat arrogance for him to be crowned for glory, in that city, in which\r\nGod had been crowned in mockery.” He died on the fifteenth before the\r\nkalends of August.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1100.] BALDWIN.]\r\n\r\nOn Godfrey’s decease, Tancred and the other chiefs declared that\r\nBaldwin, his brother, who was at that time settled in Mesopotamia,\r\nshould be king: for Eustace, the elder brother, who came to Jerusalem\r\nwith Godfrey, had long since returned to his native land. The acts of\r\nBaldwin shall be related briefly, but with unsullied truth; supported\r\nin their credibility by the narrative of Fulcher[436] of Chartres, who\r\nwas his chaplain, and wrote somewhat of him, in a style, not altogether\r\nunpolished, but, as we say, without elegance or correctness, and\r\nwhich may serve to admonish others to write more carefully. Baldwin,\r\nundertaking the holy pilgrimage with the rest, had for companions\r\nmany knights of disposition similar to his own. Confiding in these\r\nassociates, he began to levy fresh troops for his purpose; to watch for\r\nbrilliant opportunities wherein to manifest his prowess: and, finally,\r\nnot content with that commendation which was common to all, leaving the\r\nrest and departing three days’ journey from Antioch, he got possession,\r\nby the consent of its inhabitants, of Tarsus, a noble city of Cilicia:\r\nTarsus, formerly the nursing-mother of the apostle Paul, in honour\r\nof whom the cathedral there is dedicated. The Tarsians voluntarily\r\nsubmitted to his protection, as they were Christians, and hoped by his\r\naid to be defended from the Turks. The Cilicians, therefore, eagerly\r\nyielded to his power, more especially after the surrender of Turbexhel,\r\na town by situation impregnable, to whose sovereignty the inferior\r\ntowns look up. This being yielded, as I have said, the others followed\r\nits decision. And not only Cilicia, but Armenia, and Mesopotamia,\r\neagerly sought alliance with this chief: for these provinces were\r\nalmost free from the domination of the Turks, though infested by their\r\nincursions. Wherefore the prince of the city of Edessa, who was alike\r\npressed by the hatred of the citizens and the sword of the enemy, sent\r\nletters to Baldwin, descriptive of his difficulties, desiring him to\r\ncome with all speed, and receive a compensation for the labour of his\r\njourney, by his adoption, as he had no issue of either sex. This is a\r\ncity of Mesopotamia in Syria, very noted for the fruitfulness of its\r\nsoil and for the resort of merchants, twenty miles distant from the\r\nEuphrates, and a hundred from Antioch. The Greeks call it Edessa; the\r\nSyrians Rothasia. Baldwin, therefore, exacting an oath of fidelity from\r\nthe ambassadors, passed the Euphrates with only sixty-nine horsemen:\r\na wonderful instance, it may be said, either of fortitude, or of\r\nrashness, in not hesitating to proceed among the surrounding nations of\r\nbarbarians, whom any other person, with so small a force, would have\r\ndistrusted either for their race or their unbelief. By the Armenians\r\nand Syrians, indeed, coming out to meet him on the road with crosses\r\nand torches, he was received with grateful joy, and kindly entertained.\r\nBut the Turks, endeavouring to attack his rear, were frustrated in all\r\ntheir attempts by the skill of Baldwin: the Samosatians setting the\r\nfirst example of flight. Samosata is a city beyond the Euphrates, from\r\nwhich arose Paul of Samosata,[437] the confutation of whose heresy,\r\nwhoever is desirous may read in the History of Eusebius. And, if I well\r\nremember, Josephus says, that Antony was laying siege to this city,\r\nwhen Herod came to him. The Turks inhabiting that city then, who were\r\nthe first instigators of outrage against the Franks, were the first\r\nto give way. Thus, Baldwin, coming safely to Edessa, found nothing to\r\ndisappoint his expectations: for being received with surpassing favour\r\nby the prince, and soon after, on his being killed by his faithless\r\ncitizens, obtaining the lawful sovereignty of the city, for the\r\nwhole time during which the Franks were labouring at Antioch and at\r\nJerusalem, he was not free from hostilities; worsting his opponents in\r\nrepeated attacks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1100.] BALDWIN’S MARCH TO JERUSALEM.]\r\n\r\nBut in the month of November, being reminded by Boamund, prince of\r\nAntioch, that they should enter on their progress to Jerusalem, he\r\nprepared for marching, and by the single display of the white standard,\r\nwhich was his ensign in battle, overthrowing the Turks who had broken\r\nthe peace on his expected departure, he left Antioch to the right; and\r\ncame to Laodicea. Here, by the liberality of earl Raymond, who presided\r\nover the city, getting, at a cheap rate, a sufficiency of supplies\r\nfor his people, he passed Gibellum, and followed the recent track of\r\nBoamund, who had encamped and awaited him. Daibert, archbishop of\r\nPisa, joined them for the march: he had landed his confederate party\r\nat Laodicea, as did also two other bishops. These forces when united\r\nwere estimated at five and twenty thousand; many of whom, when they\r\nentered the territories of the Saracens, were, through the scarcity of\r\ncommodities, overtaken by famine, and many were dismounted, from their\r\nhorses being starved. Their distress was increased by an abundance of\r\nrain; for in that country it pours down like a torrent in the winter\r\nmonths only. In consequence, these poor wretches, having no change\r\nof garments, died from the severity of the cold; never getting under\r\ncover during several successive days. For this calamity, indeed,\r\nthere was no remedy, as there was a deficiency both of tents and of\r\nwood: but they in some measure appeased their hunger, by constantly\r\nchewing the sweet reeds, which they call cannamel;[438] so denominated\r\nfrom cane and honey. Thus, twice only, obtaining necessaries at an\r\nexorbitant price from the inhabitants of Tripoli and Cæsarea, they came\r\nto Jerusalem on the day of the winter solstice. They were met at the\r\ngates by king Godfrey with his brother Eustace, whom he had detained\r\ntill this time, who showed them every degree of respect and generosity.\r\nHaving performed in Bethlehem all the accustomed solemnities of our\r\nLord’s nativity, they appointed Daibert patriarch: to which transaction\r\nI doubt not, that the consent of pope Urban was obtained; for he was\r\nreverend from age, eloquent, and rich. After the circumcision of our\r\nLord, therefore, assuming palms[439] in Jericho, which antiquity has\r\nmade the ensign of pilgrims, each one hastily endeavoured to reach\r\nhis home. The cause of their speed was the stench of the unburied\r\ndead bodies, the fumes of which exhaled in such a manner as to infect\r\nthe air itself. In consequence, a contagious pestilence spreading in\r\nthe atmosphere, consigned to death many who had recently arrived. The\r\nrest quickened their march, by the cities on the coast, that is to\r\nsay, Tiberias and Cæsarea Philippi; for they were urged by scantiness\r\nof provision, and the fear of the enemy. Their want, as I have said,\r\nwas remedied by the celerity of their march; and to the fury of three\r\nhundred soldiers who harassed them from the town of Baldac, they\r\nopposed a military stratagem. For feigning a flight for a short time,\r\nthat by leaving the narrow passes themselves, they might induce the\r\nTurks to enter them, they retreated purposely, and then returning,\r\nrouted the straggling enemy at their pleasure. They had supposed our\r\npeople unprepared for fight, as their shields and bows were injured by\r\nthe excessive rains; not being aware, that among men, victory consists\r\nnot in reliance on excellence of arms, or of armour, but in the more\r\nnoble power of courage, and of the well-nerved arm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1100.] BOAMUND TAKEN PRISONER.]\r\n\r\nAt that time, indeed, Baldwin returned safely to Edessa, and Boamund\r\nto Antioch. But in the beginning of the month of July, a vague report\r\nreached the ears of Baldwin, that the brilliant jewel of our commanders\r\nwas dimmed; Boamund being taken, and cast into chains, by one\r\nDanisman, a heathen, and a potentate of that country. In consequence,\r\ncollecting a body of the people of Edessa and Antioch, he was in hopes\r\nof revenging this singular disgrace of the Christians. Moreover the\r\nTurk, who had taken this chieftain more by stratagem and chance than\r\nby courage or military force, as he had come with a small party to\r\nget possession of the city of Meletima, aware that the Franks would\r\nuse their utmost efforts against him for the disgrace of the thing,\r\nbetook himself to his own territories; marshalling his troops, not\r\nas though he intended to retreat, but rather to exhibit a triumph.\r\nBaldwin then proceeding two days’ march beyond Meletima, and seeing\r\nthe enemy decline the hazard of a battle, thought fit to return; but\r\nfirst, with the permission of Gabriel the governor, brought over the\r\ncity to his own disposal. In the meantime, intelligence reaching him\r\nof his brother’s death, and of the general consent of the inhabitants\r\nand chiefs to his election, he entrusted Edessa to Baldwin, his\r\nnearest relation by blood, and moreover a prudent and active man, and\r\nprepared for receiving the crown of Jerusalem. Wherefore collecting\r\ntwo hundred horse, and seven hundred foot, he proceeded on a march\r\npregnant with death and danger; whence many, who were falsely supposed\r\nfaithful, contemplating the boldness of the attempt, clandestinely\r\ndeserted. He, with the remainder, marched forward to Antioch, where\r\nfrom the resources of his sagacious mind, he became the cause of great\r\nfuture advantage to his distressed people, by advising them to choose\r\nTancred as their chief. Thence, he came to Tripoli, by the route of\r\nGibesium and Laodicea. The governor of this city, a Turk by nation,\r\nbut, from natural disposition, rich in bowels of mercy, afforded\r\nhim the necessary provisions without the walls; at the same time,\r\nkindly intimating, that he should act cautiously, as Ducach, king of\r\nDamascus, had occupied a narrow pass through which he had heard he\r\nwas to march. But he, ashamed of being moved by the threats of the\r\nSaracen, resolutely proceeded on his destination. When he came to the\r\nplace, he perceived the truth of the governor’s information: for about\r\nfive miles on this side the city of Berith, there is a very narrow\r\npassage near the sea, so confined by steep precipices, and narrow\r\ndefiles, that were a hundred men to get possession of the entrance,\r\nthey might prevent any number, however great, from passing. Such as\r\ntravel from Tripoli to Jerusalem have no possible means of avoiding\r\nit. Baldwin, therefore, arriving on the spot, sent out scouts to\r\nexamine the situation of the place, and the strength of the enemy. The\r\nparty returning, and hardly intelligible through fear, pointed out\r\nthe difficulty of the pass, and the confidence of the enemy, who had\r\noccupied it. But Baldwin, who fell little short of the best soldier\r\nthat ever existed, feeling no alarm, boldly drew up his army and led\r\nit against them. Ducach then despatched some to make an onset, and\r\nlure the party unguardedly forward; retaining his main body in a more\r\nadvantageous position. For this purpose, at first they rushed on with\r\ngreat impetuosity, and then made a feint to retreat, to entice our\r\npeople into the defile. This stratagem could not deceive Baldwin, who,\r\nskilled by long-continued warfare, made a signal to his men to make\r\nshow of flight; and to induce a supposition that they were alarmed, he\r\ncommanded the bag and baggage which they had cast down, to be again\r\ntaken up, and the cattle to be goaded forward, as well as the ranks to\r\nbe opened, that the enemy might attack them. The Turks at this began\r\nto exult, and, raging so horribly that you might suppose the Furies\r\nyelling, pursued our party. Some getting into vessels took possession\r\nof the shore, others riding forward began to kill such pilgrims as\r\nwere incautiously loitering near the sea. The Franks continued their\r\npretended flight till they reached a plain which they had before\r\nobserved. No confusion deprived these men of their judgment; even the\r\nvery emergency by which they had been overtaken nurtured and increased\r\ntheir daring; and though a small body, they withstood innumerable\r\nmultitudes both by sea and land. For the moment it appeared they had\r\nsufficiently feigned alarm, they closed their ranks, turned their\r\nstandards, and hemmed in the now-charging enemy on all sides. Thus\r\nthe face of affairs was changed, the victors were vanquished, and the\r\nvanquished became victors. The Turks were hewn down with dreadful\r\ncarnage; the remainder anxiously fled to their vessels, and when they\r\nhad gotten more than a bow-shot out to sea, they still urged them\r\nforward as fiercely with their oars, as though they supposed they\r\ncould be drawn back to land by the arm of their adversaries. And that\r\nyou may not doubt of this miracle as fanciful, but as evident, feel\r\nit as it were, only four Christian soldiers fell in procuring by\r\ntheir blood this victory to the survivors. Wherefore I assert, that\r\nthe Christians would never be conquered by the pagans, were they to\r\nimplore the Divine assistance on their courage, ere they entered the\r\nconflict; and, when in battle, conciliate the friendly powers of heaven\r\nto their arms. But since, in peace they glut themselves in every kind\r\nof vice, and in battle rely only upon their courage; therefore it\r\njustly happens, that their valour is often unsuccessful. The earl then,\r\nrejoicing in his splendid victory, on returning to spoil the slain,\r\nfound several Turks alive, whom he dismissed without personal injury,\r\nbut despoiled them of their wealth. To avoid any hidden stratagem, he\r\nthat night retreated with his party, and rested under the shelter of\r\nsome olive trees. Next day, at dawn, he approached the defile, with the\r\nlight troops, to be an eye-witness of the nature of the place; and,\r\nfinding everything safe, and making a signal by smoke, as had been\r\nagreed upon, he intimated to his associates the departure of the enemy;\r\nfor the Turks, who the day before were wantonly galloping around the\r\nhill, perceiving the carnage of their companions, had all fled in the\r\ndead of the night. Laying aside every delay, they instantly followed\r\ntheir commander. The governor of Berith sent them food on their\r\nmarch, astonished at the valour of so small a force. The Tyrians and\r\nSidonians, and Accaronites, who are also called Ptholoamites, acted in\r\nthe same manner, venerating with silent apprehension the bravery of the\r\nFranks. Nor were Tancred’s party, in Caiphas, less generous, although\r\nhe was absent. The ancient name of this town I am unable to discover;\r\nbecause all the inland cities, which we read of in Josephus as formerly\r\nexisting, are either not in being, or else, changed into inconsiderable\r\nvillages, have lost their names; whereas those on the coast remain\r\nentire. In this manner, by Cæsarea of Palestine, and Azotus, they came\r\nto Joppa. Here he was first congratulated on his kingdom, the citizens\r\nwith great joy opening the gates to him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1100.] DEFEAT OF THE TURKS.]\r\n\r\nBeing afterwards accompanied by the inhabitants of Joppa to Jerusalem,\r\nwhere he was favourably received, he indulged in a repose of seven\r\ndays’ continuance. Then, that the Turks might be convinced that the\r\nspirit of his reign would proceed to their signal disadvantage, he\r\nled his troops towards Ascalon. When at a short distance from that\r\ncity, he proudly displayed his forces, and with very little exertion\r\ncompelled the attacking Ascalonites to retreat, by waiting a favourable\r\nopportunity for accomplishing his designs. Finally, conceiving his\r\nglory satisfied for that time by their repulse, he drew off to the\r\nmountains to pursue the enemy, and also at their expense to procure\r\nnecessaries for his troops, who were famished with hunger from the\r\nbarrenness of the land: for a scanty harvest had that year denied\r\nsustenance; deceiving the expectations of the province by a meagre\r\nproduce. He ascended therefore the mountainous districts, whither the\r\nTurkish inhabitants of the country had retreated on leaving their\r\ntowns, concealing the Syrians with them in sequestered caverns. The\r\nFranks, however, discovered a mode of counteracting the device of\r\nthe fugitives, by letting smoke into their hiding-places; by which\r\nthe miscreants were dislodged, and came out one by one. The Turks\r\nwere killed to a man; the Syrians spared. The army turning aside\r\nthence, and marching towards Arabia, passed by the sepulchres of the\r\npatriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and of their three wives, Sarah,\r\nRebecca, and Leah. The place is in Hebron, thirteen miles distant from\r\nJerusalem. For the body of Joseph lies at Neapolis, formerly called\r\nSichem, covered with white marble, and conspicuous to every traveller;\r\nthere, too, are seen the tombs of his brothers, but of inferior\r\nworkmanship. The army then came into the valley where God formerly\r\noverthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, darting fire from heaven on the wicked.\r\nThe lake there extends for eighteen miles, incapable of supporting\r\nany living creature, and so horrible to the palate, as to distort the\r\nmouths of such as drink it, and distend their jaws with its bitter\r\ntaste. A hill overhangs the valley, emitting, in various places, a salt\r\nscum, and all over transparent, as it were, with congealed glass. Here\r\nis gathered what some call nitre; some call it crystal salt. Passing\r\nthe lake, they came to a very opulent town, abundant in those luscious\r\nfruits which they call dates; in devouring which they were hardly able\r\nto fill the cavities of the stomach, or constrain the greediness of\r\ntheir palates, they were so extremely sweet. Every thing else had\r\nbeen taken away, through the alarm of the inhabitants, except a few\r\nEthiopians, the dark wool of whose hair resembled smut. Our people,\r\nthinking it beneath their valour to kill persons of this description,\r\ntreated them, not with indignation, but with laughter. Adjacent to\r\nthis town is a valley, where to this day is seen the rock which Moses\r\nstruck, to give water to the murmuring tribes. The stream yet runs\r\nso plentifully, and with such a current, as to turn the machinery\r\nof mills. On the declivity of the hill stands a church in honour of\r\nthe legislator Aaron: where, through the mediation and assistance of\r\nhis brother, he used to hold converse with God. Here learning from\r\nguides conversant in the roads, who from Saracens had been converted\r\nto Christianity, that from hence to Babylon was all barren country,\r\nand destitute of every accommodation, they returned to Jerusalem,\r\nto consecrate to God the first fruits of his reign, acquired in the\r\nsubjugation of so many hostile countries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1100.] BALDWIN’S CORONATION.]\r\n\r\nThe royal insignia being prepared, Baldwin was crowned with great\r\nceremony, in Bethlehem, on Christmas-day, by Daibert the patriarch;\r\nall wishing him prosperity. For both at that time, and afterwards,\r\nhe deserved, by his own exertions, and obtained, through the favour\r\nof others, every degree of royal respect, though sovereign of a very\r\nsmall, and I had almost said, a despicable kingdom. Wherefore the\r\nChristians ought to regard the mercy of our Lord Christ, and to walk\r\nin the contemplation of his power, through whose assistance they were\r\nobjects of apprehension, though unable to do harm. For there were\r\nscarcely, in the whole service, four hundred horsemen and so many foot,\r\nto garrison Jerusalem, Ramula, Caiphas, and Joppa. For those who came\r\nthither by sea, with minds ill at ease, amid so many hostile ports,\r\nafter having adored the saints, determined to return home, as there\r\nwas no possibility of proceeding by land. Moreover, an additional\r\ndifficulty was, that in the month of March Tancred had departed to\r\nassume the government of Antioch, nor could he or the king aid each\r\nother from the length of the journey: indeed, should necessity require\r\nit, he could not, without fear of irreparable loss, march his troops\r\nfrom one town to another. I pronounce it therefore to be a manifest\r\nmiracle, that safe alone, through God’s protection, he was an object of\r\ndread to such a multitude of barbarians.\r\n\r\nIn this year, which was A.D. 1101, the sacred fire,[440] which used\r\nto signalize the Vigil of Easter, delayed its appearance longer than\r\nusual. For on the Saturday, the lessons being read, alternately in\r\nGreek and Latin, the “Kyrie eleeson”[441] repeated thrice and the\r\nmelody of the clarions resounding, still when no fire appeared, and\r\nthe setting sun induced the evening and led on the night, then all\r\ndeparted sorrowful to their homes. It had been determined, after mature\r\ndeliberation, that on that night no person should remain in the church\r\nof the Holy Sepulchre, for fear any one of infected conscience should\r\nirritate God still more through his irreverent intrusion. But when\r\nthe twilight was proceeding into day, a procession of the Latins was\r\nordered to go to the Temple of Solomon, that by prayer they might call\r\ndown the mercy of God: the same was performed around the Sepulchre\r\nof our Lord, by the Syrians plucking their beards and hair through\r\nviolence of grief. The mercy of God could endure no longer, light being\r\ninstantly sent into one lamp of the Sepulchre. Which, when a Syrian\r\nperceived glittering through a window, he expressed his joy by the\r\nclapping of his hands, and accelerated the advance of the patriarch.\r\nHe, opening the recess of the sepulchral chamber by the keys which he\r\ncarried, and lighting a taper, brought forth the celestial gift,[442]\r\nimparting it to all who crowded round him for that purpose; afterwards\r\nthe whole of the lamps, throughout the church, were divinely lighted\r\nup, the one which was next to be illumined evincing its approaching\r\nignition by emitting smoke in a miraculous manner. Thus, doubtless, the\r\nconstant manner of Christ has been to terrify those he loved that he\r\nmight again kindly soothe them, and that the dread of his power might\r\nredound to his praise. For since even the common gifts of God are\r\nlightly esteemed by men merely from their constant recurrence, he often\r\nenhances the grant of his indulgences by withholding them, that what\r\nwas most ardently desired might be more gratefully regarded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1102.] SIEGE OF CÆSAREA.]\r\n\r\nAt that time a fleet of Genoese and Pisans had touched at Laodicea,\r\nand thence made a prosperous voyage to Joppa, and the crews, drawing\r\ntheir vessels on shore, spent Easter with the king at Jerusalem. He,\r\nbargaining for their services, engaged to give them the third of the\r\nspoil of each city they should take, and any particular street they\r\nmight choose. Thus he impelled them, inconsiderate and blinded, more\r\nthrough lust of gold than love of God, to barter their blood, and\r\nlay siege immediately to Azotus, which they constrained to surrender\r\nafter three days. Nor did the townspeople yield very reluctantly,\r\nas they feared the anger of the king should they be taken by storm:\r\nfor, the preceding year, assisted by the machination of fortune, they\r\nhad vigorously repulsed Godfrey when making a similar attempt. For,\r\nindeed, when by means of scaling ladders he had advanced his forces\r\non the walls, and they, now nearly victorious, had gotten possession\r\nof the parapet, the sudden fall of a wooden tower, which stood close\r\nto the outside of the wall, deprived them of the victory and killed\r\nmany, while still more were taken and butchered by the cruelty of the\r\nSaracens. Leaving Azotus, Baldwin laid siege to Cæsarea of Palestine,\r\nwith his whole force, and with determined courage; but perceiving the\r\nresolution of its citizens and the difficulty of the enterprise, he\r\nordered engines to be constructed. Petraries[443] were therefore made,\r\nand a great tower built of twenty cubits in height, surpassing the\r\naltitude of the wall. Our people, however, impatient of delay and of\r\nsuch lingering expectation, erecting their ladders and attempting to\r\novertop the wall, arrived at the summit by the energy of their efforts,\r\nwith conscious valour indignantly raging, that they had now been\r\noccupied in conflict with the Saracens during fifteen days, and had\r\nlost the whole of that time; and although the Cæsareans resisted with\r\nextreme courage, and rolled down large stones on them as they ascended,\r\nyet despising all danger, they broke through their opponents in a\r\nclose body, and fought with an outstretched arm, and a drawn sword.\r\nThe Turks, unable longer to sustain the attack and taking to flight,\r\neither cast themselves down headlong, or fell by the hand of their\r\nenemies. Many were reserved for slavery; a few for ransom. Among these\r\nwas the governor of the city, and a bishop named Arcadius. The scene\r\nwas enough to excite laughter in a by-stander, to see a Turk disgorging\r\nbezants,[444] when struck on the neck by the fist of a Christian.\r\nThe wretched males, through fear of extreme indigence, had hid money\r\nin their mouths; the females in parts not to be particularized: you\r\nperceive that my narrative blushes to speak plainly, but the reader\r\nunderstands what I wish, or rather what I wish not to speak.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1102.] DEFEAT OF THE SARACENS.]\r\n\r\nStill, however, the emperor of Babylon could not be at rest, but would\r\nfrequently send commanders and armies to attack the Franks. Arriving\r\nat Ascalon on ship-board, they scoured about Ramula, taking advantage\r\nof the king’s occupation, who was then busied in the contest with\r\nCæsarea. They frequently, therefore, by depopulating the country,\r\nirritated him to engage. But he, with equal subtlety, that their mad\r\nimpetuosity might subside, suffered them, when eagerly advancing, to\r\ngrow languid by declining battle. By this procrastination he effected\r\nthat many, weary of delay, withdrew, while he attacked the remainder,\r\nconsisting of eleven thousand horse and twenty-one thousand infantry,\r\nwith his own two hundred and fifty cavalry and less than seven hundred\r\nfoot. Addressing a few words to his soldiers, to whom he pledged\r\nvictory if they persevered, and fame if they fell; and calling to\r\ntheir recollection that if they fled France was a great way off, he\r\ndashed first against the enemy; and the contest continuing for some\r\ntime, when he saw his ranks giving way, he remedied circumstances which\r\nseemed almost bordering on desperation. Thus dismaying the Turks by\r\nhis well-known appearance, he laid their leader prostrate with his\r\nlance; on whose death the whole battalions fled. Our soldiers, who in\r\nthe onset were so hemmed in as to be unable to see each other, then\r\nexercised their valour in such wise, under the ensign of the Holy Cross\r\nwhich preceded them, that they killed five thousand. Eighty of the\r\ncavalry and rather more of the infantry were slain on the side of the\r\nFranks. However subsequent successes consoled them, as they despatched\r\nfive hundred Arabian horse. These had been traversing before Joppa\r\nfor two days, but effecting little, they were returning to Ascalon,\r\nand seeing our troops at a distance, and, hoping they were their own,\r\nwere approaching to congratulate them on their victory. But at length\r\nperceiving, by the weapons hurled against them, that they were Franks,\r\nthey turned pale and, to use the words of the poet,[445] became like\r\nhim who,\r\n\r\n  “With unshod foot, had trod upon a snake.”\r\n\r\nIn consequence, enervated with astonishment, they exposed their backs\r\nto their destroyers. Thus the king coming to Joppa, corrected, by a\r\ntrue account, the falsity of the letter which had been sent to Tancred\r\nby the people of that city, erroneously declaring that the king had\r\nperished with his army. And, indeed, already had Tancred prepared for\r\nhis march to Jerusalem, when a messenger arriving, and showing the\r\nroyal signet, dispelled his sorrow, and restored his satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious, if I were to relate all his contests; to tell\r\nhow he subdued Tiberias, Sidon, Accaron, that is, Ptolemais, and,\r\nultimately, all the cities on the coast; or, how he distinguished\r\nalmost each day by the slaughter of the Turks, either through secret\r\nattack or open warfare. The relation of his exploits requires the\r\nexclusive labours of a man who abounds in pompous diction, and\r\nundisturbed leisure: I have neither; and, what chiefly acts as an\r\nobstacle, want clear information on the subject. For it is by no\r\nmeans the part of an historian of veracity to give entire credit\r\nto flattering reports, or to deceive the credulity of his readers.\r\nConsequently, I shall only subjoin what I have found recorded, whereby\r\nthis man’s exalted devotion may be clearly proved, and his good report\r\nlive for ever. This I may be bold to assert, that he often, with an\r\ninconsiderable force, engaged in mighty conflicts, and that he never\r\nfled the field, except at Ramula and at Accaron. And indeed signal\r\nvictories ensued to each of these flights, because they proceeded more\r\nfrom rash valour, than from fear; as the reader will discover from the\r\ninsertion of a few facts.\r\n\r\nIn the month of September, on the seventh before the ides of which the\r\nbattle aforesaid took place, William, earl of Poitou, proceeded towards\r\nJerusalem, leading with him troops estimated at sixty thousand horse\r\nand still more foot. There accompanied him, Stephen, earl of Burgundy,\r\nand Hugh de Lusignan, brother of earl Raymond, Hugh the Great, and\r\nStephen of Blois, anxious to atone for the disgrace of their former\r\ndesertion, by renovated and determined valour. Proceeding, therefore,\r\nby Constantinople, after he had by an insolent answer, as I before\r\nrelated, offended Alexius, he fell into the snares of Solyman; the\r\nemperor rather procuring than preventing his disaster. For Solyman,\r\naware that the army was suffering from hunger and thirst, as they\r\nhad been wandering about the marshes and desolate places for several\r\ndays, encountered them with three hundred thousand archers. Never was\r\nthere conflict more disastrous to the Franks; as it was impossible\r\nfor flight to save the coward, or courage to rescue the bold from\r\ndanger: for the battle was fought in a confined situation, and nothing\r\ncould prevent the effect of clouds of arrows on men who were crowded\r\ntogether. More than a hundred thousand were slain; and all the booty\r\ncarried off. Thus Solyman, obtaining splendid offerings to the manes\r\nof his countrymen from the spoils of the Franks, revenged the loss of\r\nNice. But, as they had proceeded by many roads, all were not slain;\r\nnor was every thing plundered. For, except the Poitevin, who lost\r\nnearly whatever he possessed, the other earls had boldly defended\r\ntheir baggage. All, therefore, except Hugh the Great, who died, and\r\nwas entombed in the city of Tarsus, collecting again their soldiers\r\nafter the flight, hastened to Antioch. Tancred, a knight of celebrated\r\nkindness, gave them ample proof of his generosity; assisting them all,\r\nas far as he was able, with money: but more especially William, whom\r\nthe inconstancy of Fortune had now as deeply depressed as she had\r\nformerly highly exalted, who, in addition to the loss of treasure, by\r\nwhich he was not so much affected as it was transitory and capable\r\nof reparation, was left almost the sole survivor of so many valorous\r\nsoldiers. Proceeding on their march with renovated courage, they sought\r\nevery opportunity of giving battle. The city of Tortosa was the first\r\nto feel their rage; by attacking and plundering which, they in some\r\ndegree compensated their former losses. Thence they came to the defile,\r\nwhich I have mentioned above, where the king had long awaited them, in\r\norder to give assistance in case the Turks should oppose their passage.\r\nDefended by his valour, and meeting with kind entertainment at Joppa,\r\nthey proceeded the following Easter to Jerusalem, where they joyfully\r\nbeheld, and reverently adored the sacred fire. Returning afterwards to\r\nJoppa, they took ship, each designing to revisit his native land. The\r\nPoitevin, from the continued favour of the wind, reached home; the rest\r\nwere violently driven back.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1100.] RAMULA BESIEGED.]\r\n\r\nBut now, in the beginning of May, the Turks and Arabs laid siege to\r\nRamula; recruiting the losses of their army in the former year, by\r\nmaking up its original numbers. The bishop of the city, prudently\r\nwatching an opportunity, retired from the place and went secretly to\r\nJoppa. Baldwin had already gone out, relying on a false assertion\r\nthat the enemy did not exceed five hundred; in consequence of which,\r\nhe neither put his forces in order, nor called out his infantry, the\r\ntrumpeters merely sounding for the cavalry to follow the king; though\r\nhis friends earnestly advised him, to be on his guard against the\r\nsubtlety of the Turks. The two Stephens, of Blois and of Burgundy,\r\nfollowed the king on horseback, that, instead of being branded as\r\nindolent and cowardly, they might return to their respective homes\r\npartakers of the credit of the triumph: far different, however, from\r\ntheir expectations, were the glory and the victory which the fates\r\nwere preparing for them. For Baldwin, perceiving the multitude of the\r\nenemy and finding himself deceived in his opinion, filled with rage,\r\nand fierce in conscious valour, hesitated what was to be done. If he\r\ngave way, he contemplated the tarnish of his ancient glory; if he\r\nfought, the destruction of his followers. Nevertheless, innate courage\r\nprevailed, and fear had already yielded, when, swayed by the advice of\r\nhis comrades, he acquiesced in a plan of retiring, through the midst\r\nof the enemy, into a castle. The rest, following with loud clamour,\r\nbroke through the thickest ranks, consecrating their souls to God, and\r\nnobly avenging their deaths. The earls, too, so wearied with striking\r\nthat their hands grew stiff upon their swords, yielded to fate. The\r\nking escaping to the fortress, had some few companions remaining out of\r\nthe two hundred he had led forth; who entreating that he would deign\r\nto protract his life by flight, and observing that their danger was\r\nof little consequence to the world, while his life was of advantage\r\nto many, in as much as he would be an example of valour to every age,\r\nby his singular constancy of mind though in adverse circumstances,\r\nhe esteemed himself worthy to live. Wherefore, accompanied by five\r\nknights, he eluded his assailants, and escaped to the mountains. One\r\nof the five was Robert the Englishman, as I said before; the others,\r\nfrom the great distance, report has not brought to our knowledge:\r\nhe, with three more, was taken; the fifth escaped with the king. The\r\nTurks vented the whole of their fury on those who had retired to the\r\ncastle, among whom was Hugh de Lusignan and Geoffrey de Vincennes: only\r\nthree survivors told their mournful tale to the people of Jerusalem.\r\nThe king, concealing himself during the day, and, at night, urging\r\nhis jaded courser through untrodden paths, arrived at Azotus, by the\r\nsingular and miraculous protection of God; as the Turks had but just\r\ndeparted, after having been plundering around the city for the space\r\nof two days. Coming thence by sea to Joppa, he despatched an account\r\nof the certainty of his being still living to the people of Jerusalem.\r\nThe bearer of the epistle was a low Syrian fellow, who, even had he\r\nbeen discovered, would have deceived the enemy, from the meanness of\r\nhis garb, and his using the common language of the country. Escaping\r\nthe hands of the infidels by lone paths with which he was acquainted,\r\nhe arrived the third day at Jerusalem. Upon this the cavalry who\r\ngarrisoned the city, taking with them the bands of auxiliary infantry,\r\nand purposing to proceed to Joppa, took a route close to the sea;\r\navoiding the inland districts. The rear, however, of the party, were\r\ncut off, by the Turks pressing on them; as they were left unprotected\r\neither by horse or foot. Thus collecting ninety horse from Jerusalem,\r\nand eighty from Tiberias, which Hugh, that most intrepid commander, had\r\nbrought to their assistance, the attendants also, through necessity,\r\nwere advanced to the rank of knights. The battle was delayed only\r\ntill the next day, the Turks being now so ferocious as to prepare\r\ntheir engines, and to meditate an attack on the walls of Joppa. This\r\nwas prevented by the activity of Baldwin, and by the cross of Christ\r\npreceding them, which had been wanting in the former battle. They then,\r\nwith all the force of the kingdom, rushed eagerly on the enemy, and the\r\ncontest was fierce: but they, after their usual custom, surrounding\r\nour troops, thought they had completely overcome the Christians, and\r\nshouted with cheerful cry: but the Lord Jesus was present; who, at\r\nlength looked down from heaven, and showering courage on the Franks,\r\nput the enemy, driven from the field, to flight. It had happened in the\r\npreceding action, that, though frequently driven from their tents, they\r\nafterwards conquered through their numbers; but now, as the infantry\r\nwounded them from a distance with their arrows, and the cavalry close\r\nat hand with their lances, they placed all their hopes in swiftness,\r\nand continued their flight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1113.] BALDWIN’S MARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nHe fought another battle in later years, in which our soldiers,\r\npressed by the numbers of the Turks and compelled to fly, lost even\r\ntheir protecting standard. But after they had fled some distance they\r\nrallied; shame animating the timid to repel such ignominy. Then indeed\r\nthe contest was strenuous; fighting foot to foot, and breast to breast.\r\nOur party recovered the cross, routing the enemy, and regaining the\r\nfield. Many fell here with whom I had been acquainted; among these was\r\nGodfrey, Baldwin’s bastard-grand-nephew, who, from a boy, manifested\r\nvalour in his countenance and truth in his soul. In the beginning,\r\nindeed, both retreats, as it may be said, were the source of ignominy;\r\nbut, in the end, true food for glory; the one more celebrated, the\r\nother more advantageous. Finally, to repair his losses, and also to be\r\nunited with him in marriage, the countess of Sicily came shortly after\r\nto Jerusalem, pouring such treasures into the royal palace, that it was\r\nmatter of surprise, whence a woman could accumulate such endless heaps\r\nof precious utensils:[446] and at this time, indeed, he received her\r\nto his bed, but shortly after he put her away. It is said that she was\r\nafflicted with a cancerous complaint, which preyed upon her womb.[447]\r\nThis, however, is well known, that the king had no issue; nor is it\r\nwonderful, that a man, to whom leisure was burdensome, should be averse\r\nto the embraces of a wife, as he passed all his time in war. By these\r\nexertions he effected, that his admirable and nearly godlike valour\r\nshould operate as an incitement to the present race, and be matter of\r\nastonishment to posterity. He died, during an expedition into Arabia,\r\nin the month of April, and was publicly buried at Jerusalem, near his\r\nbrother, as the fourth month was adding to the seventeenth year of his\r\nreign. He was a man who gained his reputation by repeated labours, and\r\non whose fame envy hath cast no shade, except it be, that he was too\r\nsparing of his money; though there is a ready and well-founded excuse\r\nfor such a fault, if it be considered, that the necessary largesses to\r\nsuch as remained with him, prevented him from purchasing the favour of\r\nthose who departed.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by his kinsman, Baldwin, prince of Edessa, already\r\ncelebrated for his former campaigns, whom he had, when dying, named as\r\nking. He bravely defended the kingdom for many years, and augmented it\r\nwith the sovereignty of Antioch, which he obtained when Roger,[448] the\r\nson of Richard, was killed. He governed both countries with laudable\r\nconduct; with less presumptuous haughtiness, perhaps, but with great\r\nand consummate prudence, though there are some who wound his fair fame,\r\naccusing him of excessive parsimony. Wherefore, last year, when the\r\nTurks had taken him, while riding a short distance from Jerusalem, his\r\npeople grieved but little for him, and for nearly a year it remained\r\nunknown, both to subjects and even to tale-bearers, whither he was\r\ntaken, or whether or not he breathed the vital air. However, the people\r\nof Jerusalem, nothing discouraged on account of his absence, refused\r\neither to elect a king or to discontinue the order or command of the\r\nsoldiers, till the certainty of the matter could be known. At last, the\r\nplace where he lay captive being discovered, some knights of surpassing\r\nboldness, assuming the guise of merchants, and hiding weapons beneath\r\ntheir garments, entered the town, and rescued the king from jeopardy;\r\nprotesting, that they did not act thus through respect for his\r\nniggardliness, but out of gratitude to Gozelin of Turbexhel,[449] who\r\nnever hesitated to bestow all he possibly could upon the military.\r\nHe has now lived long, a provident man, and subject to no other\r\nimputation.[450] The principality of Antioch pertains to the son of\r\nBoamund, of whom I proceed to speak.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1123.] BOAMUND.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1123.] BOAMUND’S MARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nBoamund[451] was the son of Robert Guiscard by a Norman woman; he had\r\nanother son named Roger, born of an Apulian, who was, by his father,\r\nsurnamed “Purse,” because his paternal and attentive observation had\r\ndiscovered, that, from a mere child, he had pleasure in counting money.\r\nAs to Boamund, who was somewhat older, he never could retain anything,\r\nbut even gave away his childish presents. Roger, therefore, received\r\nApulia, which seemed to belong to him in right of his mother: Boamund\r\nwent with his father to the Durazzian war. And when the townspeople,\r\nthrough confidence of their walls, boasted, that the city was called\r\nDurachium,[452] because it could endure all sieges undismayed; and “I,”\r\nsaid Guiscard, “am called Durandus; and I will endure in besieging,\r\nuntil I take away the name from the city; so that, henceforth it shall\r\nno longer be called Durachium, but Mollucium.” The firmness of this\r\nanswer so terrified them, that they immediately opened their gates.\r\nThus, secure in his rear, he subdued, with the less difficulty, the\r\nother cities as far as Thessalonica. He had now arrived there, and had\r\nalready, both by himself and by his son, taught Alexius that he might\r\nbe overcome, when, beguiled by the treachery of his wife, he failed,\r\nby death, of a noble enterprise. Boamund, then, returning to Apulia,\r\npossessed some castles through his brother’s indulgence, and acquired\r\nmany others by his own courage and prudence. Indeed the dukedom had\r\nfallen to his brother only in appearance; all the most warlike spirits\r\nfollowing him. Nor was this of light importance: for, observant of his\r\nfather’s purpose, he was averse to Guibert, and strongly espoused the\r\ncause of Urban; urging him, when hesitating, to proceed into France\r\nto the council of Clermont, whither the letters of Raymond earl of\r\nProvence, and of the bishop of Chorges, invited him. The council being\r\nended, he readily embraced the opportunity, and transported his forces\r\ninto Greece; and thence moving forward his army, he quietly awaited\r\nRaymond and Godfrey. Joining them on their arrival, he possessed great\r\ninfluence from his military skill and from his courage, which was\r\nnever surpassed. But, as what he performed in company with others,\r\nonly entitles him to a share in the general praise; and my former\r\nnarrative has related how he had been taken prisoner; it may be proper\r\nto mention in what manner he rescued himself from captivity. When\r\nDanisman perceived that no advantage resulted to him, from detaining\r\nso great a man in confinement, he changed his intentions, and began\r\nsedulously to treat of terms of peace; for he was neither inclined\r\nto put him to death, lest he should excite the fierce hatred of the\r\nChristians against himself; nor would he set him at liberty,[453]\r\nwithout the hope of a lasting peace. Boamund, therefore, promising the\r\ninfidel perpetual amity, returned to Antioch, bringing with him the\r\nsilver fetters with which he had been confined; and being favourably\r\nreceived by his people, he took possession of Laodicea, and the other\r\ncities which Tancred, lest he should have been thought slumbering in\r\nindolence, whilst his uncle was sighing in prison, had acquired during\r\nhis captivity. Not long after he came into France, offering up, in\r\nhonour of St. Leonard, the chains with which he had been burdened;\r\nfor this saint[454] is said to be so especially powerful in loosing\r\nfetters, that the captive may freely carry away his chains, even in\r\nthe sight of his enemies, who dare not mutter a syllable. He then\r\nmarried one of the daughters of the king of France, and sending another\r\nto Tancred, went to Apulia, followed by the French nobility, who\r\ndeserted their country in hope of greater advantages, as well as to be\r\neye-witnesses of what could be effected by that energetic valour, which\r\nwas so universally extolled by fame. Wherefore arranging his affairs\r\nin Apulia, he again burst forth against Alexius; alleging as a cause\r\nof attacking him, his cruelty to the crusaders, for which he was very\r\nnoted. But being deceived by the subtlety of the emperor, who alienated\r\nhis commanders from him by bribery, or took them off by poison, he had\r\nlittle or no success. Dejected at this, he returned to Apulia, where,\r\nin a few days, while purposing to proceed to Antioch, he died, not an\r\nold man, yet equal to any in prudence, leaving a son of tender age.\r\nHe was a man firm in adversity, and circumspect in prosperity; for he\r\nhad even provided himself an antidote, when apprehensive of poison. It\r\nwas a knife, which, placed before him when eating, strange to tell,\r\nindicated, by the moistness of its handle, whenever poison was brought\r\ninto the apartment. After him Tancred presided over Antioch; a nephew\r\nworthy of such an uncle. Tancred was removed from this world by an\r\nearly death, and Roger the son of Richard succeeded. Though rivalling\r\nthe fame of his predecessors in battle, yet he incurred the disgrace\r\nof being avaricious. In consequence of this, when the soldiery avoided\r\nhim, he engaged the Turks with a trifling stipendiary, and a small\r\nnative force, and fell nobly revenging his death: for being taken by\r\nthem, stripped of his armour, and commanded to yield up his sword; he\r\nrefused to deliver it to any but the commander, as he considered all\r\npresent unworthy to receive the surrender of so dignified a character.\r\nThe unhappy chief gave credit to his specious words, and taking off\r\nhis helmet, stretched out his hand to receive Roger’s sword. When,\r\nindignant, and mustering all his remaining powers for the effort, he\r\ncut off the Turk’s head, and being immediately stabbed, escaped the\r\ndisgrace of slavery by the act his courage had suggested. Baldwin the\r\nsecond, king of Jerusalem, revenging his death in a signal manner,\r\nfaithfully reserved the dominion of the city, and his daughter, for\r\nBoamund the son of Boamund.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] RAYMOND, EARL OF TOULOUSE.]\r\n\r\nRaymond was the son of the most noble William,[455] earl of Toulouse,\r\nwho, being a man of enterprise and ability, rendered his country,\r\nwhich had been obscured through the indolence of his predecessors,\r\nillustrious by his own good qualities. His wife Almodis was repeatedly\r\nmarried to different persons, and had a numerous issue by them all; a\r\nwoman of such sad, unbridled lewdness, that, when one husband became\r\ndisgusting to her from long intercourse, she would depart and take up\r\nher abode with another: to sum up all, she had been first united to the\r\nearl of Arles; presently, becoming weary of him, she connected herself\r\nwith William; and then after bearing him two sons, she lured the earl\r\nof Barcelona to marry her. Moreover, William, when at the point of\r\ndeath, gave to his son of his own name but not of his own disposition,\r\nthe county of Toulouse, because, though he was of slender talents, the\r\npeople of Toulouse would attempt no innovation against him, as they\r\nwere accustomed to the government of his family. But Raymond, who was\r\nof brighter abilities, received Chorges, and increased it wonderfully\r\nby the addition of Arles, Narbonne, Provence, and Limoges. Again, he\r\npurchased Toulouse of his brother who went to Jerusalem many years\r\nprevious to the grand crusade; but these things were achieved by a\r\nconsiderable lapse of time, and a life expended on the labour. Thus,\r\never engaged in war, he had no desire for a legitimate wife, enjoying\r\nhimself in unrestrained concubinage. Finally, he condescended to honour\r\nwith his adoption and inheritance, Bertrand, his son by one of his\r\nmistresses, as he, in some respects, resembled his father. To this\r\nson he married the niece[456] of Matilda the marchioness, a native of\r\nLombardy, that by such affinity he might secure his possessions on\r\nthat side. In the latter part of his life, too, he himself espoused\r\nthe daughter of the king of Tarragona, covenanting for a noble dowry;\r\nnamely, the perpetual peace of the adjacent provinces. Soon after this,\r\non contemplating his grey hairs, he made a vow to go to Jerusalem,\r\nthat his bodily powers, though decayed and feeble, might still, though\r\nlate, enter into the service of God. The chief promoter of this was\r\nthe bishop of Chorges, by whose especial exertions he had always\r\nbeen thwarted, and in one contest, had even lost an eye, which mark\r\nof deformity, so far from concealing, he was ever anxious to show,\r\nboasting of it as a proof of his gallantry. But now, leagued in mutual\r\nfriendship, that they might employ their old age in religious services,\r\nthey stimulated Urban, already inclined to preach the crusade, to\r\npass the Alps and summon a council at Clermont, more especially as it\r\nwas a city adjacent to their territories, and convenient for persons\r\ncoming from every part of France. The bishop, however, died on his\r\nway to the council. To his influence succeeded the bishop of Puy, of\r\nwhom we have before spoken: animated by whose advice, and protected by\r\nwhose assistance, Raymond was the first layman who assumed the cross;\r\nmaking this addition to his vow, “that he would never return to his\r\ncountry, but endeavour to lessen the weight of his past offences by\r\nperpetual exertion against the Turks.” He had already given many proofs\r\nof his prowess on the way,--the first to labour and the last to rest;\r\nmany also of forbearance, as he readily relinquished those places he\r\nhad first occupied at Antioch to Boamund, and the tower of David to\r\nGodfrey. But at length, his patience being worn out by the unreasonable\r\ndemands of certain persons, he departed from his usual practice on\r\nthe subject of the surrender of Ascalon. For, on the first arrival of\r\nthe Franks, the townspeople, examining the disposition of our several\r\ncommanders, made choice of him for their patron; because many men, who\r\nhad come thither before by sea, from Montpelier to trade, had extolled\r\nhis sincerity and courage to the skies. In consequence, they delivered\r\nto him their keys, and compelled him to make oath that he would never\r\ngive up the command of the city to any other of the Christians, should\r\nhe himself be either unwilling or unable to retain it. A murmuring then\r\narose among the chiefs, who required the surrender of the city to the\r\nking; saying that his kingdom was of little value, unless he could hold\r\nAscalon, which would be a receptacle for the enemy and an obstacle to\r\nour party. The king, indeed, set forth the matter mildly, as he did\r\neverything else, with a placid countenance consistent with his manners;\r\nthe others rather more violently. However, he paid little attention to\r\ntheir words, obviating their allegations by very substantial reasons;\r\nsaying that all his associates had secured a place of retreat; part\r\nof them had returned home; part were occupying the provinces they had\r\nacquired; that he alone, having abjured his native country, could\r\nneither return thither, nor did he possess a place of refuge here;\r\nthat he had yielded in other points, but they must allow him to retain\r\nAscalon, under fealty to the Holy Sepulchre, as he had taken an oath\r\nnot to give it up. On hearing this, all began to clamour, and to call\r\nhim interested and faithless; indeed they could scarcely abstain from\r\nlaying hands on him. The earl, indignant at this reproach, failed in\r\nthe duty of a just and upright man, delivering the keys to the enemies\r\nof God, and compensating the fear of perjury by the blood of many a man\r\nin after time; for to this day that city has never been taken either by\r\nforce or by stratagem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1099.] TANCRED’S DEATH.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, many of his people, delighted with the unbounded affluence\r\nof the place, obtained the friendship of its citizens by denying\r\ntheir faith. Thus leaving Jerusalem, he came to Laodicea, and having\r\nsubdued it, continued there some little time. Afterwards, when he\r\nhad gone to Constantinople, Tancred obtained Laodicea, though it is\r\ndubious whether by force or favour. In the meantime, remaining at\r\nByzantium, he contrived by his consummate prudence to insinuate himself\r\ninto the favour of Alexius. Whence it happened, that, through the\r\nkindness of the emperor, getting a safe passage, he escaped sharing\r\nthose calamities which, as we have before related, befell William of\r\nPoitou and the others; with whom he took the city of Tortosa, and,\r\nwhen the rest proceeded onwards, retained possession of it. To extend\r\nhis power, he fortified a town over against Tripoli, called Pilgrim’s\r\nCastle, where he appointed abbat Herbert, bishop. And that the\r\nshattered strength of his followers might recruit by repose, he made a\r\nseven years’ league with the Tripolitans. Nevertheless, ere the time\r\nappointed, the peace was broken, on account of a certain townsman being\r\nfound within the castle, with a poisoned dagger concealed beneath his\r\ngarments. And now truly would he have put the finishing hand to the\r\nconquest of Tripoli, had not death, approaching almost immediately,\r\nbereft his vital spirit, big with great achievements. On learning his\r\ndecease, William of Montpelier, and the other chiefs of the province,\r\nprovided that William the Pilgrim, scarcely four years of age, whom he\r\nhad begotten on a Spanish woman during the siege, should be conveyed\r\nhome, to be educated for the succession, with the anxious wishes of\r\nall. Nor did Bertrand hear of this transaction with displeasure,\r\nalthough he had never been consulted, as it enabled him to renew his\r\nfather’s fame. Wherefore, heading a vast army, and chiefly supported\r\nby the Genoese and Pisans, who were allied to his wife, he attacked\r\nTripoli by sea and land, and when exhausted by a protracted siege,\r\nreduced it to his dominion. To him succeeded Pontius, his son by the\r\nLombard; a youth who rivalled the glory of his ancestors, and who\r\nobtained in marriage the relict of Tancred, formerly prince of Antioch.\r\nThis, when dying, he had commanded; affirming, that, the youth would\r\ngrow up a benefit to the Christians, and an utter destruction to the\r\nTurks. Pontius therefore reigns at Tripoli, professing himself the\r\nservant of the Holy Sepulchre; in this respect following the example of\r\nhis grandfather and father.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1105.] FLIGHT OF THE TURKS.]\r\n\r\nRobert, son of William the first king of England, was born in Normandy,\r\nand already considered as a youth of excellent courage, when his\r\nfather came to England: of tried prowess, though of small stature and\r\nprojecting belly. He passed his early years amid the warlike troops of\r\nhis father, obedient to him in every respect: but in the vigorous heat\r\nof youth, led by the suggestions of his idle companions, he supposed\r\nhe could obtain Normandy from the king, during his lifetime. But when\r\nWilliam refused this, and drove away the youth by the blustering of\r\nhis terrific voice, Robert departed indignantly, and harassed his\r\ncountry by perpetual attacks. His father laughed at first, and then\r\nadded, “By the resurrection of God, this little Robin Short-boot will\r\nbe a clever fellow;” for such was his appellation, from his small\r\nstature; though there was nothing else to find fault with; as he was\r\nneither ill-made, nor deficient in eloquence, nor was he wanting in\r\ncourage or resources of mind. At length, however, the king was so\r\ntransported with anger, that he denied him his last blessing and the\r\ninheritance of England; and it was with difficulty, and disgrace, that\r\nhe could retain even Normandy. After nine years he gave proof of his\r\nmanhood in the labours of the crusade, and in many instances appeared\r\nwonderful, as neither Christian nor pagan could ever unhorse him: but\r\nmore especially in the battle of Antioch, where he graced the victory\r\nby a singular achievement. For when the Turks, as we have related, were\r\nsuddenly dismayed and fled, and our party vehemently attacked them\r\nin disorder, Corbanach, their leader, mindful of his native valour,\r\nchecked his horse, and rallied his people; calling them base slaves,\r\nand forgetful of their ancient conquests, in suffering themselves, the\r\nformer conquerors of the east, to be driven from their territories by\r\na strange, and almost unarmed people. At this reproach, many, resuming\r\ntheir courage, wheeled round, attacked the Franks, and compelled the\r\nnearest to give way, while Corbanach continued to animate his men, and\r\nto assault the enemy; nobly fulfilling his duty, both as a commander\r\nand a soldier. But now the Norman earl and Philip the clerk, son of\r\nRoger, earl of Montgomery, and Warin de Taney, a castle so named in\r\nMaine, who had before made a feint of retreating, exhorting each other\r\nwith mutual spirit, turned round their horses, and each attacking his\r\nman, threw them to the ground. Here Corbanach, though he knew the earl,\r\nyet estimating him merely by his size, and thinking it inglorious to\r\nfly, atoned for the boldness of attacking him, by a speedy exit; being\r\ninstantly deprived of life. The Turks, who were already clamouring\r\nwith boastful joy, on seeing his fall, now lost their lately-acquired\r\nhopes, and redoubled their flight. In this contest Warin fell: Robert,\r\nwith Philip, gained the victory. The latter, who acquired renown by\r\nthis service, but afterwards, as they report, closed an honourable\r\ncareer at Jerusalem, was celebrated for his learning as well as his\r\nmilitary prowess. Robert, thus coming to Jerusalem, tarnished his glory\r\nby an indelible stain, in refusing a kingdom,[457] offered to him, as\r\na king’s son, by the consent of all; and this, as it is asserted, not\r\nthrough awe of its dignity, but through the fear of endless labour.\r\nHowever, returning home, where he had reckoned on giving himself up to\r\nthe full indulgence of sensual pleasure, God mercifully visited him,\r\nas I believe, for this transgression; every where thwarting him, and\r\nturning all his enjoyments into bitterness; as will be manifested by\r\nthe sequel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1105.] STATE OF NORMANDY.]\r\n\r\nHis wife, the daughter of William de Conversano, whom he had married in\r\nApulia on his return, and whose surpassing beauty, all endeavours to\r\ndescribe are vain, died after a few years, by disease;[458] misled, as\r\nit is said, by the advice of the midwife, who had ordered her breasts,\r\nwhen in childbed, to be bound with a tight bandage, on account of the\r\ncopious flow of her milk. A great consolation, however, in this extreme\r\ndistress, was a son by his consort; who, called William by presage\r\nof his grandfather’s name, gave hope of noble talents hereafter.\r\nThe immense sum which his father-in-law had given him, under the\r\nappellation of dowry, that he might with it redeem Normandy,[459] he\r\nlavished so profusely on buffoons, and worthless people, that, in a few\r\ndays, he was pennyless. He accelerated his disgrace by his ill-advised\r\narrival in England, to wrest the kingdom from his brother Henry; but,\r\nfailing of the assistance of the traitors who had invited him, he\r\neasily yielded to his brother’s terms of peace: which, by the agreement\r\nof the chiefs of either party, were, that, he should receive an annual\r\npresent of three thousand marks from England. These were mere words:\r\nfor the king had promised this without any design of fulfilling it;\r\nbut, aware of his brother’s easiness, had deluded his soft credulity,\r\ntill his warlike passion should subside. And he, too, as if contending\r\nwith fortune whether she should give or he squander most, discovering\r\nthe mere wish of the queen, silently intreating it, kindly forgave the\r\npayment of this immense sum for ever; thinking it a very great matter,\r\nthat female pride should condescend to ask a favour; for he was her\r\ngodfather. Moreover he forgot offences, and forgave faults beyond what\r\nhe ought to have done: he answered all who applied to him, exactly as\r\nthey wished; and that he might not dismiss them in sadness, promised\r\nto give what was out of his power. By this suavity of disposition,\r\nwith which he ought to have acquired the commendations and the love\r\nof his subjects, he so excited the contempt of the Normans, that\r\nthey considered him as of no consequence whatever. For then, all the\r\nnobility falling at variance, plunder was universal, and the commonalty\r\nwere pillaged. Although the inhabitants laid their injuries before the\r\nearl, they gained no kind of redress; for though incensed at first, yet\r\nhis anger was soon appeased, either by a trifling present, or the lapse\r\nof time. Roused, however, by the extremity of their distresses, they\r\ndetermined to implore the assistance of king Henry to their suffering\r\ncountry. Henry, according to Cæsar’s axiom,[460] “That if justice is\r\never to be violated, it ought to be violated in favour of the citizens,\r\nand that you may be observant of duty in other points,” transported his\r\nforces several times into Normandy to succour expiring justice, and\r\nat last was successful enough to subjugate the whole country, with the\r\nexception of Rouen, Falaise, and Caen. Robert was now reduced so low,\r\nas to wander, hardly to be recognised, through these towns, obtaining\r\na precarious subsistence from the inhabitants. Disgusted at this,\r\nthe people of Caen did not long regard their fidelity, but sending\r\nmessengers to the king, they closed the gates of their city, with locks\r\nand bolts. Robert learning this, and wishing to escape, was hardly\r\nallowed to depart; his attendant, with the furniture of his chamber,\r\nbeing detained. Thence flying to Rouen, he had a conference with his\r\nlord, the king of France, and his relation, the earl of Flanders,\r\non the subject of assistance; but obtaining none, he determined, as\r\nhis last resource, to risk a general action. In which, through the\r\npersecution of fate, being taken prisoner, he was kept, by the laudable\r\naffection of his brother, in free custody till the day of his death;\r\nfor he endured no evil but solitude, if that can be called solitude\r\nwhere, by the attention of his keepers, he was provided with abundance\r\nboth of amusement and of food. He was confined, however, till he had\r\nsurvived all his companions in the Crusade, nor was he liberated to\r\nthe day of his death.[461] He was so eloquent in his native tongue,\r\nthat none could be more pleasant; in other men’s affairs, no counsellor\r\nwas more excellent; in military skill equal to any; yet, through the\r\neasiness of his disposition, was he ever esteemed unfit to have the\r\nmanagement of the state. But since I have already said all that I knew\r\nof Hugh the Great, and of the earls of Blois and of Flanders, I think I\r\nmay, very properly here conclude my Fourth Book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummoned by the progress of events, we have entered on the times of\r\nking Henry; to transmit whose actions to posterity, requires an abler\r\nhand than ours. For, were only those particulars recorded which have\r\nreached our knowledge, they would weary the most eloquent, and might\r\noverload a library. Who, then, will attempt to unfold in detail all\r\nhis profound counsels, all his royal achievements? These are matters\r\ntoo deep for me, and require more leisure than I possess. Scarcely\r\nCicero himself, whose eloquence is venerated by all the Western world,\r\nwould attempt it in prose; and in verse, not even a rival of the\r\nMantuan Bard. In addition to this, it is to be observed, that while I,\r\nwho am a man of retired habits, and far from the secrets of a court,\r\nwithhold my assent from doubtful relators, being ignorant of his\r\ngreater achievements, I touch only on a few events. Wherefore, it is\r\nto be feared, that where my information falls beneath my wishes, the\r\nhero, whose numerous exploits I omit, may appear to suffer. However,\r\nfor this, if it be a fault, I shall have a good excuse with him who\r\nshall recollect that I could not be acquainted with the whole of his\r\ntransactions, nor ought I to relate even all that I did know. The\r\ninsignificance of my condition effects the one; the disgust of my\r\nreaders would be excited by the other. This fifth book, then, will\r\ndisplay some few of his deeds, while fame, no doubt, will blazon\r\nthe rest, and lasting memory transmit them to posterity. Nor will\r\nit deviate from the design of the preceding four, but particularise\r\nsome things which happened during his time here and elsewhere, which\r\nperchance are either unrecorded, or unknown to many: they will occupy,\r\nindeed, a considerable portion of the volume, while I must claim the\r\nusual indulgence for long digressions, as well in this as in the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Henry the First._ [A.D. 1100-1129.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1100.] HENRY I.]\r\n\r\nHenry, the youngest son of William the Great, was born in England[462]\r\nthe third year after his father’s arrival; a child, even at that\r\ntime, fondly cherished by the joint good wishes of all, as being\r\nthe only one of William’s sons born in royalty, and to whom the\r\nkingdom seemed to pertain. The early years of instruction he passed\r\nin liberal arts, and so thoroughly imbibed the sweets of learning,\r\nthat no warlike commotions, no pressure of business, could ever erase\r\nthem from his noble mind: although he neither read much openly, nor\r\ndisplayed his attainments except sparingly. His learning, however, to\r\nspeak the truth, though obtained by snatches, assisted him much in\r\nthe science of governing; according to that saying of Plato, “Happy\r\nwould be the commonwealth, if philosophers governed, or kings would\r\nbe philosophers.” Not slenderly tinctured by philosophy, then, by\r\ndegrees, in process of time, he learned how to restrain the people with\r\nlenity; nor did he ever suffer his soldiers to engage but where he saw\r\na pressing emergency. In this manner, by learning, he trained his early\r\nyears to the hope of the kingdom; and often in his father’s hearing\r\nmade use of the proverb, that “An illiterate king is a crowned ass.”\r\nThey relate, too, that his father, observing his disposition, never\r\nomitted any means of cherishing his lively prudence; and that once,\r\nwhen he had been ill-used by one of his brothers, and was in tears, he\r\nspirited him up, by saying, “Weep not, my boy, you too will be a king.”\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-first year,[463] then, of his father’s reign, when he\r\nwas nineteen years of age, he was knighted by him at Westminster\r\nduring Pentecost; and then accompanying him to Normandy, was, shortly\r\nafter, present at his funeral; the other brothers departing whither\r\ntheir hopes led them, as my former narrative has related. Wherefore,\r\nsupported by the blessing of his father, together with his maternal\r\ninheritance and immense treasures, he paid little regard to the\r\nhaughtiness of his brothers; assisting or opposing each of them as\r\nthey merited. More attached, however, to Robert for his mildness, he\r\ntook every means of stimulating his remissness by his own spirit.\r\nRobert, on the other hand, through blameable credulity, trusting to\r\ntale-bearers, injured his innocent brother in a way which it may not be\r\nirrelevant briefly to relate.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the nobility of England were rebelling against\r\nWilliam the Second, while Robert was waiting a wind to sail over from\r\nNormandy, Henry had, by his command, departed into Brittany; when,\r\neagerly seizing the opportunity, he expended on his troops all the\r\nlarge sum of money, amounting to three thousand marks, which had been\r\nbequeathed to the young man by the will of his father. Henry, on his\r\nreturn, though perhaps he endured this with difficulty, yet observed a\r\ncautious silence on the subject. However, hearing of the restoration\r\nof peace in England, the service was ended, and they laid aside their\r\narms. The earl retired to his own territories: Henry to those which his\r\nbrother had either given, or promised to give him. Indeed he placed\r\nhis promises to account, retaining the tower of Rouen under fealty\r\nto Robert. But, by the accusation of some very infamous persons, his\r\nfidelity proved disadvantageous to him; and for no fault on his part,\r\nHenry was, in this very place, detained in free custody, lest he should\r\nescape the vigilance of his keepers. Released at the expiration of\r\nhalf a year, on the invitation of his brother William he offered him\r\nhis services; but he, remunerating the young man no better, put him\r\noff, though in distress, with empty promises for more than a year.\r\nWherefore, Robert, by his messengers, offering reparation for what had\r\nbeen done, he came to Normandy; having experienced attempts on his\r\nperson from each of his brothers. For the king, angry at his departure,\r\nhad in vain commanded him to be detained: and the earl, swayed by the\r\narts of his accusers, had changed his intention; so that, when lured to\r\nhim by soothing measures, he would not easily suffer him to depart. But\r\nhe, escaping every danger by the providence of God and his own prudent\r\ncaution, compelled his brother gladly to accede to peace, by seizing\r\nAvranches and some other castles. Soon after, William coming into\r\nNormandy to revenge himself on his brother Robert, Henry manifested\r\nhis regard to the earl at Rouen. Finally, the king’s party coming\r\nthither in the day time, he spiritedly expelled them, when already,\r\nthrough the treachery of the citizens, they had over-run the whole\r\ncity; sending a message to the earl, to oppose them in front, while he\r\npressed upon their rear. In consequence of this transaction, one Conan\r\nwas accused of treachery to the earl; who designed to cast him into\r\nchains: supposing that no greater calamity could be inflicted on the\r\nwretch, than dooming him to drag out a hated existence in prison. But\r\nHenry requested to have this Conan committed to his care; which being\r\ngranted, he led him to the top of the tower at Rouen, and ordering\r\nhim carefully to survey the surrounding territory from the heights\r\nof the citadel, ironically declaring it should all be his, he thrust\r\nhim suddenly off the ramparts into the Seine below; protesting to his\r\ncompanions, who at the same time assisted him, that no respite was due\r\nto a traitor; that the injuries of a stranger might be endured in some\r\nmanner or other; but that the punishment of a man who with an oath had\r\ndone homage, when once convicted of perfidy, never should be deferred.\r\nThis action weighed little with Robert, who was a man of changeable\r\ndisposition, for he immediately became ungrateful, and compelled his\r\ndeserving brother to retire from the city. This was the period in\r\nwhich, as has been before mentioned, Henry, as well for his security as\r\nfor his fame, made a stand against both Robert and William at Mount St.\r\nMichael’s. Thus, though he had been faithful and serviceable to either\r\nbrother, they, vouchsafing no establishment to the young man, trained\r\nhim up, as he grew in years, to greater prudence, from the scantiness\r\nof his means.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1091.] HENRY ELECTED KING.]\r\n\r\nBut on the violent death of king William, as before related, after the\r\nsolemnization of the royal funeral, he was elected king; though some\r\ntrifling dissensions had first arisen among the nobility which were\r\nallayed chiefly through the exertions of Henry earl of Warwick, a man\r\nof unblemished integrity, with whom he had long been in the strictest\r\nintimacy. He immediately promulgated an edict throughout England,\r\nannulling the illegal ordinances[464] of his brother, and of Ranulph;\r\nhe remitted taxes; released prisoners; drove the flagitious from court;\r\nrestored the nightly use of lights within the palace, which had been\r\nomitted in his brother’s time;[465] and renewed the operation of the\r\nancient laws,[466] confirming them with his own oath, and that of the\r\nnobility, that they might not be eluded. A joyful day then seemed to\r\ndawn on the people, when the light of fair promise shone forth after\r\nsuch repeated clouds of distress. And that nothing might be wanting to\r\nthe aggregate of happiness, Ranulf, the dregs of iniquity, was cast\r\ninto the gloom of a prison, and speedy messengers were despatched\r\nto recall Anselm. Wherefore, all vying in joyous acclamation, Henry\r\nwas crowned king at London, on the nones of August, four days after\r\nhis brother’s death. These acts were the more sedulously performed,\r\nlest the nobility should be induced to repent their choice; as a\r\nrumour prevailed, that Robert earl of Normandy, returning from\r\nApulia, was just on the point of arriving. Soon after, his friends,\r\nand particularly the bishops, persuading him to give up meretricious\r\npleasures and adopt legitimate wedlock, he married, on St. Martin’s\r\nday, Matilda,[467] daughter of Malcolm king of Scotland, to whom he\r\nhad long been greatly attached; little regarding the marriage portion,\r\nprovided he could possess her whom he so ardently desired. For though\r\nshe was of noble descent, being grand-niece of king Edward, by his\r\nbrother Edmund, yet she possessed but little fortune, being an orphan,\r\ndestitute of either parent; of whom there will be more ample matter of\r\nrelation hereafter.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Robert, arriving in Normandy, recovered his earldom\r\nwithout any opposition; on hearing which, almost all the nobility of\r\nthis country violated the fealty which they had sworn to the king: some\r\nwithout any cause; some feigning slight pretences, because he would\r\nnot readily give them such lands as they coveted. Robert Fitz-Haymon,\r\nand Richard de Rivers, and Roger Bigod, and Robert earl of Mellent,\r\nwith his brother Henry, alone declared on the side of justice. But all\r\nthe others either secretly sent for Robert to make him king, or openly\r\nbranded their lord with sarcasms; calling him, Godric,[468] and his\r\nconsort, Goddiva. Henry heard these taunts, and, with a terrific grin,\r\ndeferring his anger, he repressed the contemptuous expressions cast\r\non him by the madness of fools, by a studied silence; for he was a\r\ncalm dissembler of his enmities, but, in due season, avenged them with\r\nfierceness. This tempest of the times was increased by the subtlety\r\nof Ranulf. For, concerting with his butler, he procured a rope to be\r\nsent him. The deceitful servant, who was water-bearer, carried him a\r\nvery long one in a cask; by which he descended from the wall of the\r\ntower, but whether he hurt his arms, or grazed the skin off his hands,\r\nis a matter of no importance.[469] Escaping thence to Normandy, he\r\nstimulated the earl, already indignant and ripe for war, to come to\r\nEngland without a moment’s delay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1101.] ROBERT LANDS AT PORTSMOUTH.]\r\n\r\nIn the second year, then, of Henry’s reign, in the month of August,\r\narriving at Portsmouth, he landed, divided and posted his forces\r\nover the whole district. Nor did the king give way to indolence, but\r\ncollected an innumerable army over against him, to assert his dignity,\r\nshould it be necessary. For, though the nobility deserted him, yet\r\nwas his party strong; being espoused by archbishop Anselm, with his\r\nbrother bishops, and all the English. In consequence, grateful to\r\nthe inhabitants for their fidelity, and anxious for their safety, he\r\nfrequently went through the ranks, instructing them how to elude the\r\nferocity of the cavalry by opposing their shields, and how to return\r\ntheir strokes. By this he made them voluntarily demand the fight,\r\nperfectly fearless of the Normans. Men, however, of sounder counsel\r\ninterfering, who observed, that the laws of natural affection must be\r\nviolated should brothers meet in battle, they shaped their minds to\r\npeace; reflecting, that, if one fell, the other would be the weaker, as\r\nthere was no surviving brother. Besides, a promise of three thousand\r\nmarks deceived the easy credulity of the earl; who imagined that,\r\nwhen he had disbanded his army, he might gratify his inclinations with\r\nsuch an immense sum of money: which, the very next year, he cheerfully\r\nsurrendered to the queen’s pleasure, because she desired it.\r\n\r\nThe following year Robert de Belesme, eldest son of Roger de\r\nMontgomery, rebelled, fortifying the castles of Bridgenorth and Arundel\r\nagainst the king; carrying thither corn from all the district round\r\nShrewsbury, and every necessary which war requires. The castle of\r\nShrewsbury, too, joined the rebellion, the Welsh being inclined to\r\nevil on every occasion. In consequence, the king, firm in mind and\r\nbearing down every adverse circumstance by valour, collecting an army,\r\nlaid siege to Bridgenorth, from whence Robert had already retired to\r\nArundel; presuming from the plenty of provision and the courage of the\r\nsoldiers, that the place was abundantly secure. But, after a few days,\r\nthe townsmen, impelled by remorse of conscience and by the bravery of\r\nthe king’s army, surrendered: on learning which, Arundel repressed\r\nits insolence; putting itself under the king’s protection, with this\r\nremarkable condition; that its lord, without personal injury, should\r\nbe suffered to retire to Normandy. Moreover, the people of Shrewsbury\r\nsent the keys of the castle to the king by Ralph, at that time abbat\r\nof Sees, and afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, as tokens of present\r\nsubmission, and pledges of their future obedience. Thus, this fire of\r\ndissension which was expected to become excessive, wasted to ashes\r\nin the course of very few days; and the avidity of the revolters,\r\nperpetually panting after innovation, was repressed. Robert, with his\r\nbrothers, Ernulph, who had obtained the surname of his father, and\r\nRoger the Poitevin, so called because he had married his wife from that\r\ncountry, abjured England for ever; but the strictness of this oath was\r\nqualified with a proviso, “unless he should satisfy the king on some\r\nfuture occasion, by his obedient conduct.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1102.] TROUBLES IN NORMANDY.]\r\n\r\nThe torch of war now lighted up in Normandy, receiving fresh fuel by\r\nthe arrival of the traitors, blazed forth and seized every thing within\r\nits reach. Normandy, indeed, though not very wide in its extent, is\r\na convenient and patient fosterer of the abandoned. Wherefore, for a\r\nlong time, she well endures intestine broils; and on the restoration\r\nof peace, rises soon to a state more fruitful than before; at her\r\npleasure ejecting her disturbers, when detected by the province, by\r\nan easy egress into France. Whereas England does not long endure the\r\nturbulent; but when once received to her bosom, either surrenders, or\r\nputs them to death; neither, when laid waste by tumult, does she again\r\nsoon rear her recovering head. Belesme, then, arriving in Normandy,\r\nhad, both at that time and afterwards, accomplices in his malignity,\r\nand lest this should seem too little, inciters also. Among others was\r\nWilliam earl of Moreton, the son of Robert, the king’s uncle. He, from\r\na boy, had been envious of Henry’s fame, and had, more especially, on\r\nthe arrival of the Norman, manifested his evil disposition. For not\r\ncontent with the two earldoms, of Moreton in Normandy, and Cornwall\r\nin England, he demanded from the king the earldom of Kent, which Odo\r\nhis uncle had held; so troublesome and presumptuous was he, that,\r\nwith shameless arrogance, he vowed, that he would not put on his\r\ncloak till he could procure the inheritance derived to him from his\r\nuncle; for such was his expression. But even then the king, with his\r\ncharacteristic circumspection, beguiled him by the subtlety of an\r\nambiguous answer. The tumult, however, being allayed and tranquillity\r\nrestored, he not only refused assent to his demand, but persisted in\r\nrecovering what he unjustly retained; though he did it with moderation,\r\nand the sanction of law, that none of his actions might appear illegal,\r\nor contrary to equity. William, ousted by the sentence of the law,\r\nretired, indignant and furious into Normandy. Here, in addition to his\r\nfruitless attacks upon the royal castles, he assailed Richard earl of\r\nChester, the son of Hugh; invading, plundering, and destroying some\r\nplaces which formed part of his possessions: the earl himself being at\r\nthat time a minor, and under the protection and guardianship of the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1102.] BATTLE AT TENERSEBREY.]\r\n\r\nThese two persons, then, the leaders of faction and fomenters\r\nof rebellion, in conjunction with others whom I am ashamed to\r\nparticularize, harassed the country, far and wide, with their\r\ndevastations. Complaints from the suffering inhabitants on the subject\r\nof their injuries, though frequent, were lavished upon the earl in\r\nvain. He was moved by them, it is true; but fearing on his own account,\r\nlest they should disturb his ease if offended, he dissembled his\r\nfeelings. King Henry, however, felt deeply for his brother’s infamy,\r\ncarried to the highest pitch by the sufferings of the country: aware,\r\nthat it was the extreme of cruelty, and far from a good king’s duty,\r\nto suffer abandoned men to riot on the property of the poor. In\r\nconsequence, he once admonished his brother, whom he had sent for\r\ninto England, with fair words; but afterwards, arriving in Normandy,\r\nhe severely reminded him, more than once, by arms, to act the prince\r\nrather than the monk. He also despoiled William, the instigator of\r\nthese troubles, of every thing he had in England; razing his castles\r\nto the ground. But when he could, even thus, make no progress towards\r\npeace, the royal majesty long anxiously employed its thoughts, whether,\r\nregardless of fraternal affection, it should rescue the country from\r\ndanger, or through blind regard, suffer it to continue in jeopardy.\r\nAnd indeed the common weal, and sense of right, would have yielded to\r\nmotives of private affection, had not pope Paschal, as they say,[470]\r\nurged him, when hesitating, to the business by his letters: averring,\r\nwith his powerful eloquence, that it would not be a civil war, but a\r\nsignal benefit to a noble country. In consequence, passing over,[471]\r\nhe, in a short time, took, or more properly speaking, received, the\r\nwhole of Normandy; all flocking to his dominion, that he might provide,\r\nby his transcendent power, for the good of the exhausted province. Yet\r\nhe achieved not this signal conquest without bloodshed; but lost many\r\nof his dearest associates. Among these was Roger of Gloucester, a tried\r\nsoldier, who was struck on the head by a bolt from a cross-bow, at the\r\nsiege of Falaise; and Robert Fitz-Haymon, who receiving a blow on the\r\ntemple, with a lance, and losing his faculties, survived a considerable\r\ntime, almost in a state of idiotcy.[472] They relate, that he was thus\r\ndeservedly punished, because, for the sake of liberating him, king\r\nHenry had consumed the city of Bayeux, together with the principal\r\nchurch, with fire. Still, however, as we hope, they both atoned for\r\nit. For the king munificently repaired the damage of that church: and\r\nit is not easy to relate, how much Robert ennobled, by his favour,\r\nthe monastery of Tewkesbury; where the splendour of the edifice, and\r\nthe kindness of the monks, attract the eyes, and captivate the minds\r\nof the visitors. Fortune, however, to make up for the loss of these\r\npersons, put a finishing hand to the war, when at its height, and with\r\nlittle labour, gave his brother, when opposing him with no despicable\r\nforce, together with William earl of Moreton, and Robert de Belesme,\r\ninto his power. This battle was fought at Tenersebrey, a castle of the\r\nearl of Moreton’s, on Saturday the Vigil of St. Michael. It was the\r\nsame day, on which, about forty years before, William had first landed\r\nat Hastings: doubtless by the wise dispensation of God, that Normandy\r\nshould be subjected to England on the same day that the Norman power\r\nhad formerly arrived to subjugate that kingdom. Here was taken the\r\nearl of Moreton, who came thither to fulfil his promise of strenuous\r\nassistance to the townsmen, as well as in the hope of avenging his\r\ninjuries. But, made captive, as I have related, he passed the residue\r\nof his life in the gloom of a prison; meriting some credit from the\r\nvivacity of his mind, and the activity of his youth, but deserving an\r\nunhappy end, from his perfidy. Then, too, Belesme[473] escaped death by\r\nflight at the first onset; but when, afterwards, he had irritated the\r\nking by secret faction, he also was taken; and being involved in the\r\nsame jeopardy with the others, he was confined in prison as long as he\r\nlived. He was a man intolerable from the barbarity of his manners, and\r\ninexorable to the faults of others; remarkable besides for cruelty;\r\nand, among other instances, on account of some trifling fault of its\r\nfather, he blinded his godchild, who was his hostage, tearing out\r\nthe little wretch’s eyes with his accursed nails: full of cunning and\r\ndissimulation, he used to deceive the credulous by the serenity of his\r\ncountenance and the affability of his speech; though the same means\r\nterrified those who were acquainted with his malignity; as there was\r\nno greater proof of impending mischief, than his pretended mildness of\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nThe king, thus splendidly successful, returned triumphant to his\r\nkingdom, having established such peace in Normandy as it had never\r\nknown before; and such as even his father himself, with all his mighty\r\npomp of words and actions, had never been able to accomplish. Rivalling\r\nhis father also, in other respects, he restrained, by edict,[474] the\r\nexactions of the courtiers, thefts, rapine, and the violation of women;\r\ncommanding the delinquents to be deprived of sight, as well as of their\r\nmanhood. He also displayed singular diligence against the mintmasters,\r\ncommonly called moneyers; suffering no counterfeiter, who had been\r\nconvicted of deluding the ignorant by the practice of his roguery, to\r\nescape, without losing his hand.\r\n\r\nAdopting the custom of his brother, he soothed the Scottish kings\r\nby his affability. For William made Duncan, the illegitimate son of\r\nMalcolm, a knight; and, on the death of his father, appointed him king\r\nof Scotland. When Duncan was taken off by the wickedness of his uncle\r\nDonald, he promoted Edgar to the kingdom; the above-mentioned Donald\r\nbeing despatched by the contrivance of David, the youngest brother,\r\nand the power of William. Edgar yielding to fate, Henry made affinity\r\nwith Alexander, his successor, giving him his illegitimate daughter in\r\nmarriage, by whom he had no issue that I know of; and when she died,\r\nhe did not much lament her loss: for there was, as they affirm, some\r\ndefect about the lady, either in correctness of manners, or elegance\r\nof person. Alexander resting with his ancestors, David the youngest\r\nof Malcolm’s sons, whom the king had made a knight and honoured with\r\nthe marriage of a woman of quality, ascended the throne of Scotland.\r\nA youth more courtly than the rest, and who, polished, from a boy,\r\nby intercourse and familiarity with us, had rubbed off all the rust\r\nof Scottish barbarism. Finally, when he obtained the kingdom, he\r\nreleased from the payment of taxes, for three years, all such of his\r\ncountrymen as would pay more attention to their dwellings, dress more\r\nelegantly, and feed more nicely. No history has ever recorded three\r\nkings, and at the same time brothers, who were of equal sanctity, or\r\nsavoured so much of their mother’s piety; for independently of their\r\nabstemiousness, their extensive charity, and their frequency in prayer,\r\nthey so completely subdued the domestic vice of kings, that no report,\r\neven, prevailed, that any entered their bed except their legitimate\r\nwives, or that either of them had ever been guilty of any unlawful\r\nintercourse. Edmund was the only degenerate son of Margaret, who,\r\npartaking in his uncle Donald’s crime, and bargaining for half his\r\nkingdom, had been accessary to his brother’s death. But being taken,\r\nand doomed to perpetual imprisonment, he sincerely repented; and, on\r\nhis near approach to death, ordered himself to be buried in his chains:\r\nconfessing that he suffered deservedly for the crime of fratricide.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1106.] HENRY’S EXPEDITION TO WALES.]\r\n\r\nThe Welsh, perpetually rebelling, were subjugated by the king in\r\nrepeated expeditions, who, relying on a prudent expedient to quell\r\ntheir tumults, transported thither all the Flemings then resident in\r\nEngland. For that country contained such numbers of these people, who,\r\nin the time of his father, had come over from national relationship\r\nto his mother, that, from their numbers, they appeared burdensome to\r\nthe kingdom. In consequence he settled them, with all their property\r\nand connexions, at Ross, a Welsh province, as in a common receptacle,\r\nboth for the purpose of cleansing the kingdom, and repressing the\r\nbrutal temerity of the enemy. Still, however, he did not neglect\r\nleading his expeditions thither, as circumstances required: in one of\r\nwhich, being privily aimed at with an arrow from a distance, though\r\nby whose audacity is unknown, he opportunely and fortunately escaped,\r\nby the interposition of his firmly mailed hauberk, and the counsel of\r\nGod at the same time frustrating this treachery. But neither was the\r\ndirector of the arrow discovered at that time, nor could he ever after\r\nbe detected, although the king immediately declared, that it was not\r\nlet fly by a Welshman, but by a subject; swearing to it, by the death\r\nof our Lord, which was his customary oath when moved, either by excess\r\nof anger or the importance of the occasion. For at that very time the\r\narmy was marching cautiously and slowly upon its own ground, not in\r\nan enemy’s territory, and therefore nothing less was to be expected\r\nthan an hostile attack. But, nevertheless, he desisted not from his\r\npurpose through fear of intestine danger, until the Welsh appeased the\r\ncommotion of the royal spirit, by giving the sons of their nobility as\r\nhostages, together with some money, and much of their substance.\r\n\r\nBy dint of gold, too, he brought the inhabitants of Brittany to his\r\nviews, whom, when a young man, he had had as neighbours to his castles\r\nof Danfrunt and Mount St. Michael’s; for these are a race of people,\r\npoor at home, and seeking abroad to support a toilsome life by foreign\r\nservice. Regardless of right and of affinity, they decline not even\r\ncivil war, provided they are paid for it; and, in proportion to the\r\nremuneration, are ready to enter any service that may be offered. Aware\r\nof this custom, if, at any time he had need of stipendiary troops, he\r\nused to lavish money on these Bretons; thereby hiring the faith of a\r\nfaithless nation.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of his reign he offended Robert, earl of Flanders,\r\nfrom the following cause: Baldwin the Elder, the grandfather of this\r\nRobert, had powerfully assisted William, when going to England, by\r\nthe wisdom of his councils, for which he was famed, and by a supply\r\nof soldiers. William had frequently made splendid returns for this;\r\ngiving, every year, as they report, three hundred marks[475] of silver\r\nto his father-in-law, on account of his fidelity and affinity. This\r\nmunificence was not diminished towards his son Baldwin; though it was\r\ndropped through the evil disposition of Robert Friso, as my history\r\nhas already recorded. Moreover this Robert, the son of Friso, easily\r\nobtained the omitted largess from William the Second, because the one\r\nalleged his relationship, and the other possessed a boundless spirit in\r\nsquandering money. But Henry giving the business deeper consideration,\r\nas a man who never desired to obtain money improperly, nor ever\r\nwantonly exhausted it when acquired, gave the following reply to\r\nRobert, on his return from Jerusalem, when imperiously making a demand,\r\nas it were, of three hundred marks of silver. He said, “that the kings\r\nof England were not accustomed to pay tribute to the Flemings; and\r\nthat he would not tarnish the liberty of his ancestors by the stain\r\nof his cowardice; therefore, if he would trust to his generosity,\r\nhe would willingly give him, as a kinsman and as a friend, whatever\r\ncircumstances would permit; but if he thought proper to persist in his\r\ndemand, he should refuse it altogether.” Confuted by this reasoning,\r\nhe, for a long time, cherished his indignation against Henry; but\r\ngetting little or nothing by his enmity, he bent his mind to milder\r\nmeasures; having discovered that the king might be wrought upon by\r\nintreaty, but not by imperious insolence. But now, the change of times\r\nhad given his son, Baldwin, matter of offence against Henry; for,\r\nwishing to place William,[476] the son of Robert the Norman, in his\r\ninheritance, he voluntarily busied himself in the affairs of others,\r\nand frequently made unexpected attacks upon the king’s castles in\r\nNormandy. He threatened extreme trouble to the country, had the fates\r\npermitted; but engaging at Arques with a larger party of soldiers than\r\nhe had apprehended, he accelerated his death; for his helmet being\r\nbattered with repeated strokes, he received an injury in his brain.\r\nThey relate, that his disorder was increased from having that day\r\neaten garlic with goose, and that he did not even abstain from carnal\r\nintercourse at night. Here let posterity contemplate a noble specimen\r\nof royal attention; for the king sent a most skilful physician to\r\nthe patient, bewailing, as we may believe, that person’s perishing\r\nby disease, whom, through admiration of his valour, he had rather\r\nseen survive. Charles, his successor, never annoyed the king; and\r\nfirst, with a doubtful, but afterwards, a formal treaty, embraced his\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] PHILIP, KING OF FRANCE.]\r\n\r\nPhilip, king of France, was neither friendly nor hostile to our\r\nking, being more intent on gluttony than business; neither were his\r\ndominions situated in the vicinity of Henry’s castles; for the few\r\nwhich he possessed at that time in Normandy were nearer to Brittany\r\nthan France. Besides, as I have said before, Philip growing in years\r\nwas oppressed by lust; and, allured by the beauty of the countess of\r\nAnjou, was enslaved to illicit passion for her. In consequence of his\r\nbeing excommunicated by the pope, no divine service could be celebrated\r\nin the town where he resided; but on his departure the chiming of the\r\nbells resounded on all sides, at which he expressed his stupid folly by\r\nlaughter, saying, “You hear, my fair, how they drive us away.”[477] He\r\nwas held in such contempt by all the bishops of his kingdom, that no\r\none, except William,[478] archbishop of Rouen, would marry them: the\r\nrashness of which deed he atoned for by being many years interdicted,\r\nand was with difficulty, at last, restored to apostolical communion\r\nby archbishop Anselm. In the meanwhile, no space of time could give\r\nsatiety to Philip’s mad excess, except that, in his last days, being\r\nseized with sickness, he took the monastic habit at Flory.[479] She\r\nacted with better grace and better success; as she sought the veil of\r\na nun at Fontevrault, while yet possessed of strength and health, and\r\nundiminished beauty. Soon after she bade adieu to the present life:\r\nGod, perhaps, foreseeing that the frame of a delicate woman could not\r\nendure the austerities of a monastery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] LEWIS, KING OF FRANCE.]\r\n\r\nLewis, the son of Philip, was very changeable; firmly attached to\r\nneither party. At first, extremely indignant against Robert, he\r\ninstigated Henry to seize Normandy; seduced by what had been plundered\r\nfrom the English, and the vast wealth of the king. Not indeed, that the\r\none offered it, but the other invited him; exhorting him, of his own\r\naccord, not to suffer the nerves of that once most flourishing country,\r\nto be crippled by his forbearance. But an enmity afterwards arose\r\nbetween them, on account of Theobald, earl of Blois, son of Stephen who\r\nfell at Ramula; Theobald being the son of Stephen by Adala, daughter\r\nof William the Great. For a considerable time, messengers on the part\r\nof the king wasted their labour, entreating that Lewis would condescend\r\nto satisfy Theobald. But he, paying little regard to entreaties, caused\r\nTheobald to be excommunicated by the pope, as arrogant and a rebel to\r\nGod; who, in addition to the austerity of his manners, which seemed\r\nintolerable to all, was represented as depriving his lord of his\r\nhereditary possessions. Their quarrel being thus of long continuance,\r\nwhen, each swollen with pride, neither would vail his consequence to\r\nthe other, Lewis entered Normandy, proudly devastating every thing\r\nwith overbearing violence. These things were reported to the king, who\r\nshut himself up in Rouen until the common soldiers infested his ears,\r\nby saying, “That he ought to allow Lewis to be driven back; a man who\r\nformerly kept his bed through corpulency, but was now, by Henry’s\r\nforbearance, loading the very air with threats.” The king, mindful\r\nof his father’s example, rather preferred crushing the folly of the\r\nFrenchman by endurance, than repelling it by force. Moreover, he kindly\r\nsoothed his soldiers, by addressing them to the following effect, “That\r\nthey ought not to wonder if he avoided lavishing the blood of those\r\nwhom he had proved to be faithful by repeated trials: that it would be\r\nimpious, in achieving power to himself, to glory in the deaths of those\r\npersons who had devoted their lives to voluntary conflicts for his\r\nsafety; that they were the adopted of his kingdom, the foster-children\r\nof his affection; wherefore he was anxious to follow the example of a\r\ngood king, and by his own moderation to check the impetuosity of those\r\nwhom he saw so ready to die for him.” At last, when he beheld his\r\nforbearance wrongly interpreted, and denominated cowardice, insomuch\r\nthat Lewis burnt and plundered within four miles of Rouen; he called\r\nup the powers of his soul with greater effort, and, arraying his\r\ntroops, gloriously conquered: compensating his past forbearance by a\r\nsanguinary victory. But, however, soon afterwards, peace was concluded,\r\n“Because there is a change in all things, and money, which is capable\r\nof persuading what it lists, extenuates every injury.” In consequence\r\nWilliam, the son of our king, did homage to the king of France for\r\nNormandy, holding that province, in future, by legal right from him.\r\nThis was the period when the same youth married the daughter of Fulco,\r\nearl of Anjou, and obtained, by the careful management of his father,\r\nthat, through the mediation of money and of affinity, no tumults should\r\naffect the son.\r\n\r\nAt this time, pope Calixtus,[480] of whom I shall relate much\r\nhereafter, approached the confines of Normandy, where the king of\r\nEngland, entering into conference with him, compelled the Romans to\r\nadmire and proclaim the ingenuity of the Normans. For he had come,\r\nas was reported, ill-disposed towards Henry; intending severely to\r\nexpostulate with him, for keeping his brother, the pilgrim of the Holy\r\nSepulchre, in confinement. But being pressed by the king’s answer,\r\nwhich was specious, and by his plausible arguments, he had little\r\nto reply. For even common topics may avail, through eloquence of\r\nspeech; and, more especially, that oratory cannot be despised, which\r\nis seasoned with valuable presents. And that nothing might be wanting\r\nto the aggregate of glory, he provided some youths of noble family,\r\nthe sons of the earl of Mellent, to dispute with the cardinals in\r\nlogic. To whose inextricable sophisms, when, from the liveliness of\r\ntheir arguments, they could make no resistance, the cardinals were not\r\nashamed to confess, that the Western climes flourished with greater\r\nliterary eminence, than they had ever heard of, or imagined, while yet\r\nin their own country. Wherefore, the issue of this conference, was,\r\nthat the pope declared, that nothing could be more just than the king\r\nof England’s cause; nothing more conspicuous than his prudence, or more\r\ncopious than his eloquence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] ROBERT, EARL OF MELLENT.]\r\n\r\nThe father of these youths was Robert, earl of Mellent, as I observed,\r\nthe son of Roger de Beaumont, who built the monastery of Preaux in\r\nNormandy; a man of primitive simplicity and sincerity, who, being\r\nfrequently invited by William the First, to come to England, and\r\nreceive, as a recompence, whatever possessions he chose, always\r\ndeclined; saying, that he wished to cultivate the inheritance of his\r\nforefathers, rather than covet or invade foreign possessions which\r\ndid not belong to him. He had two sons, Robert, of whom we are\r\nspeaking, and Henry. Henry earl of Warwick, a man of sweet and placid\r\ndisposition, passed and ended his days, in occupations congenial to his\r\nhabits. The other, more shrewd, and of a subtler character, in addition\r\nto his paternal inheritance in Normandy and large estates in England,\r\npurchased from the king of France a castle called Mellent, which\r\nHugh the son of Gualeraun, his mother’s brother, had held. Conducted\r\ngradually by budding hope towards fame in the time of the former\r\nkings, he attained to its full bloom in Henry’s days; and his advice\r\nwas regarded as though the oracle of God had been consulted: indeed he\r\nwas deservedly esteemed to have obtained it, as he was of ripe age to\r\ncounsel; the persuader of peace, the dissuader of strife, and capable\r\nof very speedily bringing about whatever he desired, from the powers\r\nof his eloquence. He possessed such mighty influence in England, as to\r\nchange by his single example the long established modes of dress and of\r\ndiet. Finally, the custom of one meal a day, is observed[481] in the\r\npalaces of all the nobility through his means; which he, adopting from\r\nAlexius, emperor of Constantinople, on the score of his health, spread,\r\nas I have observed, among the rest by his authority. He is blamed,\r\nas having done, and taught others to do this, more through want of\r\nliberality, than any fear of surfeit, or indigestion; but undeservedly:\r\nsince no one, it is said, was more lavish in entertainments to others,\r\nor more moderate in himself. In law, he was the supporter of justice;\r\nin war, the insurer of victory: urging his lord the king to enforce the\r\nrigour of the statutes; himself not only following the existing, but\r\nproposing new ones: free himself from treachery towards the king, he\r\nwas the avenger of it in others.[482]\r\n\r\nBesides this personage king Henry had among his counsellors, Roger[483]\r\nbishop of Salisbury, on whose advice he principally relied. For,\r\nbefore his accession, he had made him regulator of his household,\r\nand on becoming king, having had proof of his abilities, appointed\r\nhim first chancellor and then a bishop. The able discharge of his\r\nepiscopal functions led to a hope that he might be deserving of a\r\nhigher office. He therefore committed to his care the administration\r\nof the whole kingdom, whether he might be himself resident in England\r\nor absent in Normandy. The bishop refused to embroil himself in\r\ncares of such magnitude, until the three archbishops of Canterbury,\r\nAnselm, Ralph, William, and lastly the pope, enjoined him the duty\r\nof obedience. Henry was extremely eager to effect this, aware that\r\nRoger would faithfully perform every thing for his advantage. Nor did\r\nhe deceive the royal expectation; but conducted himself with so much\r\nintegrity and diligence, that not a spark of envy was kindled against\r\nhim. Moreover, the king was frequently detained in Normandy, sometimes\r\nfor three, sometimes four years, and sometimes for a longer period;\r\nand on his return to his kingdom, he gave credit to the chancellor’s\r\ndiscretion for finding little or nothing to distress him. Amid all\r\nthese affairs, he did not neglect his ecclesiastical duties, but daily\r\ndiligently transacted them in the morning, that he might be more ready\r\nand undisturbed for other business. He was a prelate of a great mind,\r\nand spared no expense towards completing his designs, especially in\r\nbuildings, which may be seen in other places, but more particularly at\r\nSalisbury and at Malmesbury. For there he erected extensive edifices,\r\nat vast cost, and with surpassing beauty; the courses of stone being so\r\ncorrectly laid that the joint deceives the eye, and leads it to imagine\r\nthat the whole wall is composed of a single block. He built anew the\r\nchurch of Salisbury, and beautified it in such a manner that it yields\r\nto none in England, but surpasses many, so that he had just cause to\r\nsay, “Lord, I have loved the glory of thy house.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] MURCARD, KING OF IRELAND.]\r\n\r\nMurcard, king of Ireland, and his successors, whose names have not\r\nreached our notice, were so devotedly attached to our Henry that they\r\nwrote no letters but what tended to soothe him, and did nothing but\r\nwhat he commanded; although it may be observed that Murcard, from\r\nsome unknown cause, acted, for a short time, rather superciliously\r\ntowards the English; but soon after on the suspension of navigation\r\nand of foreign trade, his insolence subsided. For of what value could\r\nIreland be if deprived of the merchandize of England? From poverty, or\r\nrather from the ignorance of the cultivators, the soil, unproductive\r\nof every good, engenders, without the cities, a rustic, filthy swarm\r\nof natives; but the English and French inhabit the cities in a greater\r\ndegree of civilization through their mercantile traffic. Paul, earl of\r\nOrkney, though subject by hereditary right to the king of Norway, was\r\nso anxious to obtain the king’s friendship, that he was perpetually\r\nsending him presents; for he was extremely fond of the wonders of\r\ndistant countries, begging with great delight, as I have observed,\r\nfrom foreign kings, lions, leopards, lynxes, or camels,--animals which\r\nEngland does not produce. He had a park called Woodstock, in which he\r\nused to foster his favourites of this kind. He had placed there also\r\na creature called a porcupine, sent to him by William of Montpelier;\r\nof which animal, Pliny the Elder, in the eighth book of his Natural\r\nHistory, and Isodorus, on Etymologies, relate that there is such a\r\ncreature in Africa, which the inhabitants call of the urchin kind,\r\ncovered with bristly hairs, which it naturally darts against the dogs\r\nwhen pursuing it: moreover, these are, as I have seen, more than a\r\nspan long, sharp at each extremity, like the quills of a goose where\r\nthe feather ceases, but rather thicker, and speckled, as it were, with\r\nblack and white.\r\n\r\nWhat more particularly distinguished Henry was that though frequently\r\nand long absent from his kingdom on account of the commotions in\r\nNormandy, yet he so restrained the rebellious, by the terror of his\r\nname, that peace remained undisturbed in England. In consequence,\r\nforeigners willingly resorted thither, as to the only haven of secure\r\ntranquillity. Finally, Siward king of Norway, in his early years\r\ncomparable to the bravest heroes, having entered on a voyage to\r\nJerusalem, and asking the king’s permission, wintered in England.\r\nAfter expending vast sums upon the churches, as soon as the western\r\nbreeze opened the gates of spring to soothe the ocean, he regained\r\nhis vessels, and proceeding to sea, terrified the Balearic Isles,\r\nwhich are called Majorca and Minorca, by his arms, leaving them an\r\neasier conquest to the before-mentioned William of Montpelier. He\r\nthence proceeded to Jerusalem with all his ships in safety except one;\r\nshe, while delaying to loose her cable from shore, was sucked into\r\na tremendous whirlpool, which Paul[484] the historian of Lombardy\r\ndescribes as lying between the coasts of the Seine and Aquitaine,\r\nwith such a force of water that its dashing may be heard at thirty\r\nmiles’ distance. Arriving at Jerusalem he, for the advancement\r\nof the Christian cause, laid siege to, battered, and subdued the\r\nmaritime cities of Tyre and Sidon. Changing his route, and entering\r\nConstantinople, he fixed a ship, beaked with golden dragons, as a\r\ntrophy, on the church of Sancta Sophia. His men dying in numbers in\r\nthis city, he discovered a remedy for the disorder, by making the\r\nsurvivors drink wine more sparingly, and diluted with water; and this\r\nwith singular sagacity; for pouring wine on the liver of a hog, and\r\nfinding that it presently dissolved by the acridity of the liquor, he\r\nimmediately conjectured that the same effect took place in men, and\r\nafterwards dissecting a dead body, he had ocular proof of it. Wherefore\r\nthe emperor contemplating his sagacity and courage, which promised\r\nsomething great, was inclined to detain him. But he adroitly deluded\r\nthe expectation in which he was already devouring the Norwegian gold;\r\nfor, obtaining permission to go to a neighbouring city, he deposited\r\nwith him the chests of his treasures, filled with lead and sealed up,\r\nas pledges of a very speedy return; by which contrivance the emperor\r\nwas deceived, and the other returned home by land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] CHARACTER OF HENRY I.]\r\n\r\nBut my narrative must now return to Henry. He was active in providing\r\nwhat would be beneficial to his empire;[485] firm in defending\r\nit; abstinent from war, as far as he could with honour; but when\r\nhe had determined no longer to forbear, a most severe requiter of\r\ninjuries, dissipating every opposing danger by the energy of his\r\ncourage; constant in enmity or in affection towards all; giving too\r\nmuch indulgence to the tide of anger in the one, gratifying his\r\nroyal magnanimity in the other; depressing his enemies indeed even\r\nto despair, and exalting his friends and dependants to an enviable\r\ncondition. For philosophy propounds this to be the first or greatest\r\nconcern of a good king,\r\n\r\n  “To spare the suppliant, but depress the proud.”[486]\r\n\r\nInflexible in the administration of justice, he ruled the people with\r\nmoderation; the nobility with condescension. Seeking after robbers\r\nand counterfeiters with the greatest diligence, and punishing them\r\nwhen discovered; neither was he by any means negligent in matters of\r\nlesser importance. When he heard that the tradesmen refused broken\r\nmoney,[487] though of good silver, he commanded the whole of it to be\r\nbroken, or cut in pieces. The measure of his own arm was applied to\r\ncorrect the false ell of the traders, and enjoined on all throughout\r\nEngland. He made a regulation for the followers of his court, at\r\nwhichever of his possessions he might be resident, stating what they\r\nshould accept without payment from the country-folks; and how much,\r\nand at what price, they should purchase; punishing the transgressors\r\nby a heavy pecuniary fine, or loss of life. In the beginning of his\r\nreign, that he might awe the delinquents by the terror of example,\r\nhe was more inclined to punish by deprivation of limb; afterwards by\r\nmulct. Thus, in consequence of the rectitude of his conduct, as is\r\nnatural to man, he was venerated by the nobility, and beloved by the\r\ncommon people. If at any time the better sort, regardless of their\r\nplighted oath, wandered from the path of fidelity, he immediately\r\nrecalled them to the straight road by the wisdom of his plans, and\r\nhis unceasing exertions; bringing back the refractory to soundness\r\nof mind by the wounds he inflicted on their bodies. Nor can I easily\r\ndescribe what perpetual labour he employed on such persons, while\r\nsuffering nothing to go unpunished which the delinquents had committed\r\nrepugnant to his dignity. Normandy, as I have said before, was the\r\nchief source of his wars, in which, though principally resident, yet\r\nhe took especial care for England; none daring to rebel, from the\r\nconsideration of his courage and of his prudence. Nor, indeed, was\r\nhe ever singled out for the attack of treachery, by reason of the\r\nrebellion of any of his nobles, through means of his attendants, except\r\nonce; the author of which was a certain chamberlain, born of a plebeian\r\nfather, but of distinguished consequence, as being keeper of the king’s\r\ntreasures; but, detected, and readily confessing his crime, he paid\r\nthe severe penalty of his perfidy.[488] With this exception, secure\r\nduring his whole life, the minds of all were restrained by fear, their\r\nconversation by regard for him.\r\n\r\nHe was of middle stature, exceeding the diminutive, but exceeded by\r\nthe very tall: his hair was black, but scanty near the forehead; his\r\neyes mildly bright; his chest brawny; his body fleshy: he was facetious\r\nin proper season, nor did multiplicity of business cause him to be\r\nless pleasant when he mixed in society. Not prone to personal combat,\r\nhe verified the saying of Scipio Africanus, “My mother bore me a\r\ncommander, not a soldier;” wherefore he was inferior in wisdom to no\r\nking of modern time; and, as I may almost say, he clearly surpassed\r\nall his predecessors in England, and preferred contending by counsel,\r\nrather than by the sword. If he could, he conquered without bloodshed;\r\nif it was unavoidable, with as little as possible. He was free, during\r\nhis whole life, from impure desires;[489] for, as we have learned from\r\nthose who were well informed, he was led by female blandishments, not\r\nfor the gratification of incontinency, but for the sake of issue; nor\r\ncondescended to casual intercourse, unless where it might produce that\r\neffect; in this respect the master of his natural inclinations, not the\r\npassive slave of lust. He was plain in his diet, rather satisfying the\r\ncalls of hunger, than surfeiting himself by variety of delicacies. He\r\nnever drank but to allay thirst; execrating the least departure from\r\ntemperance, both in himself and in those about him. He was heavy to\r\nsleep, which was interrupted by frequent snoring. His eloquence was\r\nrather unpremeditated than laboured; not rapid, but deliberate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] PIETY OF HENRY I.]\r\n\r\nHis piety towards God was laudable, for he built monasteries in\r\nEngland and in Normandy: but as he has not yet completed them, I, in\r\nthe meantime, should suspend my judgment, did not my affection for\r\nthe brotherhood at Reading forbid my silence. He built this monastery\r\nbetween the rivers Kennet and Thames, in a place calculated for the\r\nreception of almost all who might have occasion to travel to the more\r\npopulous cities of England, where he placed monks of the Clugniac\r\norder, who are at this day a noble pattern of holiness, and an example\r\nof unwearied and delightful hospitality. Here may be seen what is\r\npeculiar to this place: for guests arriving every hour, consume\r\nmore than the inmates themselves. Perhaps, some person may call me\r\nover-hasty and a flatterer, for so signally celebrating a congregation\r\nyet in its infancy; unconscious what future times may produce: but\r\nthey, as I hope, will endeavour, by the grace of God, to continue in\r\nvirtue; and I blush not at commending men of holiness, and admiring\r\nthat excellence in others which I possess not myself. He yielded up\r\nthe investiture[490] of the churches to God and St. Peter, after\r\nmuch controversy between him and archbishop Anselm, scarcely induced,\r\neven at last, to consent, through the manifold grace of God, by an\r\ninglorious victory over his brother. The tenor of these disputes Edmer\r\nhas recorded at great length; I, to give a completer knowledge of\r\nthe matter, shall subjoin the letters of the so-often-mentioned pope\r\nPaschal on the subject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] PASCHAL ON INVESTITURES.]\r\n\r\n“Paschal the bishop to king Henry, health. From your letters, lately\r\ntransmitted to us by your servant, our beloved son, William the clerk,\r\nwe have been certified both of the safety of your person, and of those\r\nprosperous successes which the divine favour hath granted you in the\r\nsubjugation of the adversaries of your kingdom. We have heard too,\r\nthat you have had the male issue you so much desired, by your noble\r\nand religious consort. As we have derived pleasure from this, we\r\nthink it a good opportunity to impress the commands and will of God\r\nmore strongly upon you, at a time when you perceive yourself indebted\r\nto his kindness for such ample favours. We also are desirous of\r\nassociating our kindness with the benefits of God towards you; but it\r\nis distressing, that you should seem to require what we cannot possibly\r\ngrant. For if we consent, or suffer, that investitures be conferred by\r\nyour excellence, no doubt it will be to the great detriment both of\r\nourselves, and of you. In this matter we wish you to consider, what\r\nyou lose by not performing, or gain by performing. For we, by such a\r\nprohibition, obtain no increase of influence, or patronage, over the\r\nchurches; nor do we endeavour to take away any thing from your just\r\npower and right; but only that God’s anger may be diminished towards\r\nyou, and thus every prosperity attend you. God, indeed, hath said,\r\n‘Those that honour me, I will honour; and those that despise me, shall\r\nbe lightly esteemed.’ You will say then, ‘It is my right;’ no truly, it\r\nis neither an imperial nor royal, but a divine right; it is His only,\r\nwho has said, ‘I am the door:’ wherefore I entreat for his sake, whose\r\ndue it is, that you would restore and concede it to him, to whose love\r\nyou owe what you possess. But why should we oppose your pleasure, or\r\nrun counter to your good will, unless we were aware, that in consenting\r\nto this matter, we should oppose the will of God, and lose his favour?\r\nWhy should we deny you any thing, which might be granted to any man\r\nliving, when we should receive greater favours in return? Consider, my\r\ndearest son, whether it be an honour, or a disgrace that Anselm, the\r\nwisest, and most religious of the Gallican bishops, on this account,\r\nfears to be familiar with you, or to continue in your kingdom. What\r\nwill those persons think, who have hitherto had such favourable\r\naccounts of you? What will they say, when this gets noised abroad? The\r\nvery people who, before your face, commend your excess, will, when out\r\nof your presence, be the first more loudly to vilify the transaction.\r\nReturn then to your understanding, my dearest son, we entreat you, for\r\nthe mercy of God, and the love of his Only-begotten Son: recall your\r\npastor, recall your father; and if, what we do not imagine, he hath in\r\nanything conducted himself harshly towards you, and hath opposed the\r\ninvestitures, we will mediate according to your pleasure, as far as God\r\npermits: but nevertheless, remove from your person and your kingdom the\r\ninfamy of such an expulsion. If you do this, even although you should\r\nask very difficult matters of us; still if, with God’s permission, we\r\ncan grant, you shall certainly obtain, them: and we will be careful to\r\nentreat the Lord for you, himself assisting, and will grant indulgence\r\nand absolution, as well to your sins, as to those of your consort,\r\nthrough the merits of the holy apostles. Moreover, we will, together\r\nwith you, cherish the son whom you have begotten on your exemplary and\r\nnoble consort; and who is, as we have heard, named after your excellent\r\nfather, William, with such anxious care, that whosoever shall injure\r\neither you, or him, shall be regarded as having done injury to the\r\nchurch of Rome. Dated at the palace of Lateran, the ninth before the\r\nkalends of December.”\r\n\r\n“Paschal to Anselm. We have received those most gratifying letters of\r\nyour affection, written with the pen of charity. In these we recognise\r\nthe fervency of your devotion, and considering the strength of your\r\nfaith, and the earnestness of your pious care, we rejoice; because, by\r\nthe grace of God, neither promises elevate, nor threats depress you. We\r\nlament, however, that after having kindly received our brother bishops,\r\nthe ambassadors of the king of England, they should, on their return\r\nhome, report what we never uttered, or even thought of. For, we have\r\nheard, that they said, if the king conducted himself well in other\r\nrespects, we should neither prohibit the investiture of the churches,\r\nnor anathematize them, when conferred; but that we were unwilling\r\nthus to write, lest from this precedent other princes should exclaim.\r\nWherefore we call Jesus, who trieth the hearts and reins, as witness to\r\nour soul, if ever such a horrid crime, even entered our imagination,\r\nsince we assumed the care of this holy see.” And again below. “If,\r\ntherefore, a lay hand present the staff, the sign of the shepherd’s\r\noffice, or the ring, the emblem of faith, what have the bishops to\r\ndo in the church? Moreover, those bishops who have changed the truth\r\ninto a lie, that truth, which is God, being the criterion, we separate\r\nfrom the favour of St. Peter and our society, until they have made\r\nsatisfaction to the church of Rome. Such, therefore, as have received\r\nthe investiture,[491] or consecration, during the aforesaid truce,[492]\r\nwe regard as aliens to our communion and to the church.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] LETTER OF POPE PASCHAL.]\r\n\r\n“Paschal to Anselm. Since the condescension of Almighty God hath\r\ninclined the heart of the king of England to obedience to the papal\r\nsee, we give thanks to the same God of mercies, in whose hand are\r\nsituated the hearts of kings. We believe it indeed to have been\r\neffected through favour to your charity, and the earnestness of\r\nyour prayers, that in this respect the heavenly mercy hath regarded\r\nthe people over whom your watchfulness presides. But whereas we\r\nso greatly condescend to the king and those who seem culpable, you\r\nmust know that this has been done from kindness and compassion, that\r\nwe may lift up those that are down. And you, also, reverend and\r\ndearest brother in Christ, we release from the prohibition or, as you\r\nconceive, excommunication, which, you understand, was denounced against\r\ninvestitures or homage by our predecessor of holy memory pope Urban.\r\nBut do you, by the assistance of God, accept those persons who either\r\nreceive investitures, or consecrate such as have received them, or\r\ndo homage on making that satisfaction which we signify to you by our\r\ncommon legates William and Baldwin, faithful and true men, and absolve\r\nthem by virtue of our authority. These you will either consecrate\r\nyourself, or command to be consecrated by such as you choose; unless\r\nperchance you should discover somewhat in them on account of which they\r\nought to be deprived of their sacred honours. And if any, hereafter,\r\nin addition to the investitures of the churches, shall have accepted\r\nprelacies, even though they have done homage to the king, yet let them\r\nnot, on this account, be denied the office of consecration, until by\r\nthe grace of Almighty God, the heart of the king may be softened, by\r\nthe dew of your preaching, to omit this. Moreover, against the bishops\r\nwho have brought, as you know, a false report from us, our heart is\r\nmore vehemently moved, because they have not only injured us, but have\r\nled astray the minds of many simple people, and impelled the king to\r\nwant of charity for the papal see. Wherefore, by the help of God, we\r\nsuffer not their crime to pass unpunished: but since the earnestness of\r\nour son the king unceasingly entreats for them, you will not deny, even\r\nthem, the participation of your communion. Indeed, you will, according\r\nto our promise, absolve from their transgressions and from penance the\r\nking and his consort, and those nobles who for this business, together\r\nwith the king, have by our command been under sentence, whose names you\r\nwill learn from the information of the aforesaid William. We commit the\r\ncause of the bishop of Rouen to your consideration, and we grant to him\r\nwhatsoever you may allow.”\r\n\r\nIn this manner acted Paschal the supreme pope, anxious for the liberty\r\nof the churches of God. The bishops whom he accuses of falsehood, were\r\nGirard archbishop of York, and Herbert of Norwich, whose errors were\r\ndiscovered by the more veracious legates, William afterwards bishop of\r\nExeter, and Baldwin monk of Bec. Anselm[493] the archbishop was now\r\nagain, in the time of this king, an exile at Lyons, resident with Hugh,\r\narchbishop of that city, when the first letter which I have inserted\r\nwas despatched; for he himself possessed no desire to return, nor did\r\nthe king, through the multitude of sycophants, suffer his animosity\r\nto be appeased. He deferred, therefore, for a long time, recalling\r\nhim or complying with the papal admonition; not from desire of power,\r\nbut through the advice of the nobility, and particularly of the earl\r\nof Mellent, who, in this affair, running counter to reason more from\r\nancient custom than a sense of right, alleged that the king’s majesty\r\nmust be much diminished if, disregarding the usage of his predecessors,\r\nhe ceased to invest the elected person with the staff and ring. The\r\nking, however, considering more attentively what the clear reasoning\r\nof the epistles, and the bountiful gift of divine favours, plentifully\r\nshowered down upon him, admonished, yielded up the investiture of the\r\nring and staff for ever, retaining only the privilege of election and\r\nof the temporalities. A great council, therefore, of bishops, nobles,\r\nand abbats, being assembled at London, many points of ecclesiastical\r\nand secular business were settled, many differences adjusted. And\r\nnot long after, five bishops were ordained in Kent, on the same day,\r\nby archbishop Anselm: William to the see of Winchester; Roger to\r\nSalisbury; William to Exeter; Reinald to Hereford; Urban to Glamorgan.\r\nIn this manner a controversy, agitated by perpetual dissensions, and\r\nthe cause of many a journey to and from Rome by Anselm, met with a\r\ncommendable termination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1107.] ACCOUNT OF QUEEN MATILDA.]\r\n\r\nHenry’s queen, Matilda, descended from an ancient and illustrious race\r\nof kings, daughter of the king of Scotland, as I have said before,\r\nhad also given her attention to literature, being educated, from her\r\ninfancy, among the nuns at Wilton and Romsey. Wherefore, in order to\r\nhave a colour for refusing an ignoble alliance, which was more than\r\nonce offered by her father, she wore the garb indicative of the holy\r\nprofession. This, when the king was about to advance her to his bed,\r\nbecame matter of controversy; nor could the archbishop be induced to\r\nconsent to her marriage, but by the production of lawful witnesses,\r\nwho swore that she had worn the veil on account of her suitors, but\r\nhad never made her vow. Satisfied with a child of either sex, she\r\nceased having issue, and enduring with complacency, when the king\r\nwas elsewhere employed, the absence of the court, she continued many\r\nyears at Westminster; yet was no part of royal magnificence wanting\r\nto her; but at all times crowds of visitants and talebearers were, in\r\nendless multitudes, entering and departing from her superb dwelling;\r\nfor this the king’s liberality commanded; this her own kindness and\r\naffability attracted. She was singularly holy; by no means despicable\r\nin point of beauty; a rival of her mother’s piety; never committing\r\nany impropriety, as far as herself was concerned; and, with the\r\nexception of the king’s bed, completely chaste and uncontaminated\r\neven by suspicion. Clad in hair cloth beneath her royal habit, in\r\nLent, she trod the thresholds of the churches barefoot. Nor was\r\nshe disgusted at washing the feet of the diseased; handling their\r\nulcers dripping with corruption, and, finally, pressing their hands,\r\nfor a long time together to her lips, and decking their table. She\r\nhad a singular pleasure in hearing the service of God; and on this\r\naccount was thoughtlessly prodigal towards clerks of melodious voice;\r\naddressed them kindly, gave to them liberally, and promised still\r\nmore abundantly. Her generosity becoming universally known, crowds\r\nof scholars, equally famed for verse and for singing, came over; and\r\nhappy did he account himself who could soothe the ears of the queen by\r\nthe novelty of his song. Nor on these only did she lavish money, but\r\non all sorts of men, especially foreigners, that through her presents\r\nthey might proclaim her celebrity abroad; for the desire of fame is\r\nso rooted in the human mind, that scarcely is any one contented with\r\nthe precious fruits of a good conscience, but is fondly anxious, if\r\nhe does any thing laudable, to have it generally known. Hence, it was\r\njustly observed, the disposition crept upon the queen to reward all the\r\nforeigners she could, while the others were kept in suspense, sometimes\r\nwith effectual, but oftener with empty promises. Hence, too, it arose\r\nthat she fell into the error of prodigal givers; bringing many claims\r\non her tenantry, exposing them to injuries, and taking away their\r\nproperty; by which obtaining the credit of a liberal benefactress, she\r\nlittle regarded their sarcasms. But whoso shall judge rightly, will\r\nimpute this to the designs of her servants, who, harpy-like, conveyed\r\neverything they could gripe into their purses or wasted it in riotous\r\nliving. Her ears being infected with the base insinuations of these\r\npeople, she induced this stain on her noble mind, holy and meritorious\r\nin every other respect. Amid these concerns she was snatched away from\r\nher country, to the great loss of the people, but to her own advantage;\r\nfor her funeral being splendidly celebrated at Westminster, she entered\r\ninto rest; and her spirit manifested, by no trivial indications, that\r\nshe was a resident in heaven. She died, willingly leaving the throne,\r\nafter a reign of seventeen years and six months, experiencing the fate\r\nof her family, who almost all departed in the flower of their age. To\r\nher, but not immediately, succeeded Adala,[494] daughter of the duke of\r\nLouvain, which is the principal town of Lorraine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1116.] PRINCE WILLIAM DROWNED.]\r\n\r\nBy Matilda king Henry had a son named William, educated and destined to\r\nthe succession,[495] with the fondest hope, and surpassing care. For\r\nto him, when scarcely twelve years of age, all the free men of England\r\nand Normandy, of every rank and condition, and under fealty to whatever\r\nlord, were obliged to submit themselves by homage, and by oath. When\r\na boy, too, he was betrothed to and received in wedlock, the daughter\r\nof Fulco[496] earl of Anjou, who was herself scarcely marriageable;\r\nhis father-in-law bestowing on him the county of Maine as her dower.\r\nMoreover, Fulco, proceeding to Jerusalem, committed his earldom to the\r\nking, to be restored, should he return, but otherwise, to go to his\r\nson-in-law. Many provinces, then, looked forward to the government of\r\nthis boy: for it was supposed that the prediction of king Edward would\r\nbe verified in him; and it was said, that now might it be expected,\r\nthat the hopes of England, like the tree[497] cut down, would, through\r\nthis youth, again blossom and bring forth fruit, and thus put an end\r\nto her sufferings: but God saw otherwise; for this illusion vanished\r\ninto air, as an early day was hastening him to his fate. Indeed,\r\nby the exertions of his father-in-law, and of Theobald the son of\r\nStephen, and of his aunt Adala, Lewis king of France conceded the\r\nlegal possession of Normandy to the lad, on his doing him homage. The\r\nprudence of his truly careful father so arranged and contrived, that\r\nthe homage, which he, from the extent of his empire, disdained to\r\nperform, should not be refused by his son, a youth of delicate habit,\r\nand not very likely to live. In discussing and peaceably settling\r\nthese matters, the king spent the space of four years; continuing\r\nthe whole of that time in Normandy. Nevertheless, the calm of this\r\nbrilliant, and carefully concerted peace, this anxious, universal hope,\r\nwas destroyed in an instant by the vicissitudes of human estate. For,\r\ngiving orders for returning to England, the king set sail from Barfleur\r\njust before twilight on the seventh before the kalends of December;\r\nand the breeze which filled his sails conducted him safely to his\r\nkingdom and extensive fortunes. But the young man, who was now somewhat\r\nmore than seventeen years of age, and, by his father’s indulgence,\r\npossessed everything but the name of king, commanded another vessel\r\nto be prepared for himself; almost all the young nobility flocking\r\naround him, from similarity of youthful pursuits. The sailors, too,\r\nimmoderately filled with wine, with that seaman’s hilarity which their\r\ncups excited, exclaimed, that those who were now a-head must soon be\r\nleft astern; for the ship was of the best construction, and recently\r\nfitted with new materials. When, therefore, it was now dark night,\r\nthese imprudent youths, overwhelmed with liquor, launched the vessel\r\nfrom the shore. She flies swifter than the winged arrow, sweeping the\r\nrippling surface of the deep: but the carelessness of the intoxicated\r\ncrew drove her on a rock, which rose above the waves not far from\r\nshore. In the greatest consternation, they immediately ran on deck,\r\nand with loud outcry got ready their boat-hooks, endeavouring, for a\r\nconsiderable time, to force the vessel off: but fortune resisted and\r\nfrustrated every exertion. The oars, too, dashing, horribly crashed\r\nagainst the rock,[498] and her battered prow hung immoveably fixed.\r\nNow, too, the water washed some of the crew overboard, and, entering\r\nthe chinks, drowned others; when the boat having been launched, the\r\nyoung prince was received into it, and might certainly have been saved\r\nby reaching the shore, had not his illegitimate sister, the countess\r\nof Perche, now struggling with death in the larger vessel, implored\r\nher brother’s assistance; shrieking out that he should not abandon\r\nher so barbarously. Touched with pity, he ordered the boat to return\r\nto the ship, that he might rescue his sister; and thus the unhappy\r\nyouth met his death through excess of affection: for the skiff,\r\novercharged by the multitudes who leaped into her, sank, and buried\r\nall indiscriminately in the deep. One rustic[499] alone escaped; who,\r\nfloating all night upon the mast, related in the morning, the dismal\r\ncatastrophe of this tragedy. No ship was ever productive of so much\r\nmisery to England; none ever so widely celebrated throughout the world.\r\nHere also perished with William, Richard, another of the king’s sons,\r\nwhom a woman of no rank had borne him, before his accession; a youth\r\nof intrepidity, and dear to his father from his obedience: Richard\r\nearl of Chester, and his brother Otuell, the tutor and preceptor of\r\nthe king’s son: the countess of Perche, the king’s daughter, and his\r\nniece the countess of Chester, sister to Theobald: and indeed almost\r\nevery person of consequence about court, whether knight, or chaplain,\r\nor young nobleman, training up to arms. For, as I have said, they\r\neagerly hastened from all quarters, expecting no small addition to\r\ntheir reputation, if they could either amuse, or show their devotion\r\nto the young prince. The calamity was augmented by the difficulty\r\nof finding the bodies, which could not be discovered by the various\r\npersons who sought them along the shore; but delicate as they were,\r\nthey became food for the monsters of the deep. The death of this youth\r\nbeing known, produced a wonderful change in existing circumstances. His\r\nfather renounced the celibacy he had cherished since Matilda’s death,\r\nanxious for future heirs by a new consort: his father-in-law, returning\r\nhome from Jerusalem, faithfully espoused the party of William, the\r\nson of Robert earl of Normandy, giving him his other daughter[500]\r\nin marriage, and the county of Maine; his indignation being excited\r\nagainst the king, by his daughter’s dowry being detained in England\r\nafter the death of the prince.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1120.] PRINCESS MATILDA.]\r\n\r\nHis daughter Matilda, by Matilda, king Henry gave in marriage to Henry\r\nemperor of Germany,[501] son of that Henry mentioned in the third\r\nbook. Henry was the fifth emperor of the Germans of this name; who,\r\nalthough he had been extremely incensed at his father for his outrages\r\nagainst the holy see, yet, in his own time, was the rigid follower\r\nof, and stickler for, the same sentiments. For when Paschal, a man\r\npossessed of every virtue, had succeeded pope Urban, the question again\r\narose concerning the investiture of the churches, together with all\r\nthe former contentions and animosities: as neither party would give\r\nway. The emperor had in his favour all the bishops and abbats of his\r\nkingdoms situated on this side of the mountains; because Charles the\r\nGreat, to keep in check the ferocity of those nations, had conferred\r\nalmost all the country on the churches: most wisely considering, that\r\nthe clergy would not so soon cast off their fidelity to their lord as\r\nthe laity; and, besides, if the laity were to rebel, they might be\r\nrestrained by the authority of their excommunication, and the weight\r\nof their power. The pope had brought over to his side the churches\r\nbeyond the mountains, and the cities of Italy scarcely acknowledged\r\nthe dominion of Henry; thinking themselves exonerated from servitude\r\nafter the death of his brother Conrad, who, being left by his father as\r\nking of Lombardy, had died at Arezzo. But Henry, rivalling the ancient\r\nCæsars in every noble quality, after tranquillizing his German empire,\r\nextended his thoughts to his Italian kingdom: purposing to quell\r\nthe revolt of the cities, and decide the question of investitures,\r\naccording to his own pleasure. This progress to Rome, accomplished by\r\ngreat exertion of mind, and much painful labour of body, hath been\r\ndescribed by David, bishop of Bangor, a Scot; though far more partially\r\nto the king than becomes an historian. Indeed he commends highly even\r\nhis unheard-of violence in taking the pope captive, though he held\r\nhim in free custody; citing the example of Jacob’s holding the angel\r\nfast till he extorted a blessing. Moreover, he labours to establish,\r\nthat the saying of the apostle, “No servant of God embroils himself in\r\nworldly business,” is not repugnant to the desires of those bishops,\r\nwho are invested by the laity, because the doing homage to a layman, by\r\na clergyman, is not a secular business. How frivolous such arguments\r\nare, any person’s consideration may decide. In the meantime, that I\r\nmay not seem to bear hard on a good man by my judgment, I determine\r\nto make allowances for him, since he has not written a history, but\r\na panegyric. I will now therefore faithfully insert the grant and\r\nagreement extorted from the pope, by a forcible detention of three\r\nweeks; and I shall subjoin, in what manner they were soon after made of\r\nnone effect, by a holier council.\r\n\r\n“The sovereign pope Paschal will not molest the sovereign king, nor\r\nhis empire nor kingdom, on account of the investiture of bishoprics\r\nand abbeys, nor concerning the injury suffered by himself and his\r\nparty in person and in goods; nor will he return evil to him, or any\r\nother person, on this account; neither, on any consideration, will\r\nhe publish an anathema against the person of king Henry; nor will\r\nthe sovereign pope delay to crown him, according to the ritual; and\r\nhe will assist him, as far as possible, by the aid of his office, to\r\nretain his kingdom and empire. And this the sovereign pope will fulfil\r\nwithout fraud or evil design.” These are the names of the bishops and\r\ncardinals who, at the command of the sovereign pope Paschal, confirmed\r\nby oath the grant to, and friendship with, the sovereign emperor\r\nHenry: Peter, bishop of Porto; Censius, bishop of Sabina; Robert,\r\ncardinal of St. Eusebius; Boniface, cardinal of St. Mark; Anastasius,\r\ncardinal of St. Clement; Gregory, cardinal of the apostles Peter and\r\nPaul; also Gregory, cardinal of St. Chrysogonus; John, cardinal of\r\nSt. Potentiana; Risus, cardinal of St. Lawrence; Remerus, cardinal of\r\nSaints Marcellinus and Peter; Vitalis, cardinal of St. Balbina; Teuzo,\r\ncardinal of St. Mark; Theobald, cardinal of John and Paul; John, deacon\r\nin the Greek School;[502] Leo, dean of St. Vitalis; Albo, dean of\r\nSergius and Bacchius.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] OATH OF HENRY V.]\r\n\r\nThe king also made oath as follows: “I, Henry, the king, will, on\r\nthe fourth or fifth day of the ensuing week, set at liberty the\r\nsovereign pope, and the bishops and cardinals, and all the captives\r\nand hostages, who were taken for him or with him; and I will cause\r\nthem to be conducted, safely, within the gates of the city, beyond the\r\nTiber;[503] nor will I hereafter seize, or suffer to be seized, such\r\nas remain under fealty to the lord Paschal: and with the Roman people,\r\nand the city beyond the Tiber, I will, as well by myself as by my\r\npeople, preserve peace and security, that is, to such persons as shall\r\nkeep peace with me. I will faithfully assist the sovereign pope, in\r\nretaining his papacy quietly and securely. I will restore the patrimony\r\nand possessions of the Roman church which I have taken away; and I will\r\naid him in recovering and keeping every thing which he ought to have,\r\nafter the manner of his predecessors, with true faith, and without\r\nfraud or evil design: and I will obey the sovereign pope, saving the\r\nhonour of my kingdom and empire, as Catholic emperors ought to obey\r\nCatholic Roman pontiffs.” And they who swore on the part of the king\r\nare these: Frederic, archbishop of Cologne; Godebard, bishop of Trent;\r\nBruno, bishop of Spires; Berengar, earl; Albert, chancellor; Herman,\r\nearl; Frederic, count palatine; Boniface, marquis; Albert, earl of\r\nBlandriac; Frederic, earl; Godfrid, earl; Warner, marquis.\r\n\r\nThis treaty being settled and confirmed by the oath of the aforesaid\r\nbishops and cardinals, and mutual embraces exchanged, the sovereign\r\npope, on Sunday, the fourth before the ides of April, celebrated the\r\nmass, “As though just born,” in which, after his own communion, and\r\nthat of the ministers at the altar, he gave the body and blood of our\r\nLord to the emperor with these words: “This body of the Lord, which\r\nthe truly holy church retains, born of the Virgin Mary, exalted on the\r\ncross for the redemption of mankind, we give to thee, my dearest son,\r\nfor the remission of thy sins, and for the preservation of the peace\r\nand true friendship to be confirmed between me and thee, the empire\r\nand the priesthood.” Again, on the next day, the pope and the king met\r\nat the columns[504] which are in the Forum, guards being stationed\r\nwherever it was deemed necessary, that the consecration of the king\r\nmight not be impeded. And at the Silver[505] gate he was received by\r\nthe bishops and cardinals, and all the Roman clergy; and the prayer\r\nbeing begun, as contained in the ritual, by the bishop of Ostia, as\r\nthe bishop of Albano, by whom it ought to have been said, had he been\r\npresent, was absent, he was conducted to the middle of the Rota,[506]\r\nand there received the second prayer from the bishop of Porto, as the\r\nRoman ritual enjoins. After this they led him, with litanies, to the\r\nconfessionary of the Apostles,[507] and there the bishop of Ostia\r\nanointed him between the shoulders and on the right arm. This being\r\ndone he was conducted, by the sovereign pontiff, to the altar of the\r\naforesaid apostles, and there the crown being placed on his head by the\r\npope himself, he was consecrated emperor. After putting on the crown,\r\nthe mass of the Resurrection of the Lord was celebrated, in which,\r\nbefore the communion, the sovereign pope, with his own hand, gave to\r\nthe emperor the grant, in which he conceded to him and his kingdom what\r\nis underwritten; and in the same place confirmed it by the sanction of\r\na curse.\r\n\r\n“Pope Paschal, servant of the servants of God, sendeth health and his\r\napostolical benediction, to his dearest son in Christ, Henry Augustus,\r\nby the grace of Almighty God, emperor of the Romans. The Divine\r\ndisposal hath ordained, that your kingdom shall unite with the holy\r\nRoman church, since your predecessors, through valour and surpassing\r\nprudence, have obtained the crown and sovereignty of the Roman city;\r\nto the dignity of which crown and empire, the Divine Majesty, by the\r\nministry of our priesthood, hath advanced your person, my dearest son\r\nHenry. That pre-eminence of dignity, then, which our predecessors have\r\ngranted to yours, the Catholic emperors, and have confirmed in the\r\nvolume of grants, we also concede to your affection, and in the scroll\r\nof this present grant confirm also, that you may confer the investiture\r\nof the staff and ring on the bishops or abbats of your kingdom, freely\r\nelected, without violence or simony: but, after their investiture,\r\nlet them receive canonical consecration from the bishop to whom it\r\npertains. But if any person shall be elected, either by the clergy or\r\nthe people, against your consent, unless he be invested by you, let him\r\nbe consecrated by no one; excepting such, indeed, as are accustomed\r\nto be at the disposal of the archbishops, or of the Roman pontiff.\r\nMoreover, let the archbishops or bishops have permission, canonically,\r\nto consecrate bishops or abbats invested by you. Your predecessors,\r\nindeed, so largely endowed the churches of their kingdom of their\r\nroyalties, that it is fitting that kingdom should be especially\r\nstrengthened by the power of bishops or abbats; and that popular\r\ndissensions, which often happen in all elections, should be checked by\r\nroyal majesty. Wherefore, your prudence and authority ought to take\r\nmore especial care to preserve the grandeur of the Roman church, and\r\nthe safety of the rest, through God’s assistance, by your gifts and\r\nservices. Therefore, if any ecclesiastical or secular person, knowing\r\nthis document of our concession, shall rashly dare oppose it, let him\r\nbe bound with the chain of an anathema, unless he recant, and hazard\r\nhis honour and dignity. But may God’s mercy preserve such as keep it,\r\nand may he grant your person and authority to reign happily to his\r\nhonour and glory.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1111.] HENRY V CONSECRATED EMPEROR.]\r\n\r\nThe whole ceremony of the consecration being completed, the pope\r\nand the emperor, joining their right hands, went with much state to\r\nthe chamber which fronts the confessionary of St. Gregory, that the\r\npope might there put off his pontifical, and the emperor his regal\r\nvestments. As the emperor retired from the chamber divested of his\r\nroyal insignia, the Roman patricians met him with a golden circle,\r\nwhich they placed upon his head, and by it gave him the supreme\r\npatriciate[508] of the Roman city, with common consent and universal\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\nAll this parade of grants and consecration I have taken literally from\r\nthe narrative of the aforesaid David, written, as I said, with too\r\ngreat partiality towards the king. In the following year, however,\r\na council was assembled at Rome, rather by the connivance than the\r\ncommand of the pope, and the grant was nullified. The authors of\r\nits reversal, were, the archbishop of Vienne, who afterwards ruled\r\nthe papal see;[509] and Girard, bishop of Angouleme: who stimulated\r\ntheir brother bishops, to make these concessions of none effect. The\r\nproceedings of that council were as follow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1112.] COUNCIL AT ROME.]\r\n\r\n“A.D. 1112, the fifth of the indiction, in the thirteenth year of\r\nthe sovereign pope Paschal the second, in the month of March, on the\r\nfifteenth before the kalends of April, a council was held at Rome,\r\nat the Lateran, in the church of Constantine;[510] where, when pope\r\nPaschal, together with the archbishops, bishops, and cardinals and a\r\nmixed company of clergy and laity, had, on the last day of the council,\r\ntaken his seat; making public profession of the Catholic faith, lest\r\nany one should doubt his orthodoxy, he said, “I embrace all the Holy\r\nScripture of the Old and New Testament; the Law written by Moses, and\r\nby the holy prophets: I embrace the four Gospels; the seven canonical\r\nEpistles, the Epistles of the glorious preacher St. Paul, the apostle,\r\nthe holy canons of the apostles; the four Universal councils, as the\r\nfour gospels, the Nicene, Ephesian, Constantinopolitan, Chalcedonian:\r\nmoreover the council of Antioch and the decrees of the holy fathers,\r\nthe Roman pontiffs; and more especially the decrees of my lords pope\r\nGregory the seventh, and pope Urban of blessed memory. What they have\r\napproved, I approve: what they held, I hold: what they have confirmed,\r\nI confirm: what they have condemned, I condemn: what they have\r\nopposed, I oppose: what they have interdicted, I interdict: what they\r\nhave prohibited, I prohibit: I will persevere in the same in every\r\nthing and through every thing.” This being ended, Girard, bishop of\r\nAngouleme, legate in Aquitaine, rose up for all, and by the unanimous\r\nconsent of pope Paschal and of all the council, read the following\r\nwriting. “That grant which is no grant, but ought more properly to\r\nbe called an abomination,[511] for the liberation of captives and of\r\nthe church, extorted from the sovereign pope Paschal by the violence\r\nof king Henry, the whole of us in this holy council assembled, with\r\nthe sovereign pope, condemn by canonical censure, and ecclesiastical\r\nauthority, by the judgment of the Holy Spirit; and we adjudge it to\r\nbe void, and altogether nullify it: and that it may have neither\r\nforce nor efficacy, we interdict it altogether. And it is condemned,\r\non this account; because in that abomination it is asserted, that a\r\nperson canonically elected by the clergy and the people, shall not be\r\nconsecrated by any one, unless first invested by the king; which is\r\ncontrary to the Holy Spirit and to canonical institution.” This writing\r\nbeing read, the whole council, and all present, unanimously cried out\r\nAmen, Amen: So be it, so be it.\r\n\r\nThe archbishops there present with their suffragans were these: John,\r\npatriarch of Venice: Semies of Capua: Landulf of Benevento: Amalfi,\r\nReggio, Otranto, Brindisi, Capsa, Cerenza;[512] and the Greeks,\r\nRosanus, and the archbishop of St. Severina; the bishops were, Censius\r\nof Sabina, Peter of Porto, Leo of Ostia, Cono of Prænesti, Girard of\r\nAngouleme, Galo of Leon, legate for Berri and the archbishop of Vienne,\r\nRoger of Volaterra, Gaufrid of Sienna, Rolland of Populonia, Gregory\r\nof Tarracina, William of Turin,[513] William of Syracuse, legate for\r\nall the Sicilians, and near a hundred other bishops. Siwin, and John\r\nbishop of Tusculum, though at Rome, were not present on that day of the\r\ncouncil; but they afterwards, on the reading of the condemnation of the\r\ngrant, assented and approved of it.\r\n\r\nThese things gaining publicity, all France made no scruple of\r\nconsidering the emperor as accursed by the power of ecclesiastical\r\nzeal hurled against him. Roused at this, in the seventeenth[514] year\r\nof pope Paschal, he proceeded to Rome, to inflict signal vengeance\r\non him. But he, by a blessed departure,[515] had avoided all earthly\r\nmolestation, and from his place of repose on high, laughed at the\r\nthreats of the angry emperor; who having heard of his death, quickened\r\nhis journey, in order that ejecting John Gaitan, chancellor to the\r\nlate pope, who had been already elected and called Gelasius, he might\r\nintrude Maurice,[516] bishop of Brague, surnamed Bourdin, on the See:\r\nbut the following epistle of Gelasius will explain the business more\r\nfully.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] EPISTLE OF GELASIUS.]\r\n\r\n“Gelasius, servant of the servants of God to the archbishops, bishops,\r\nabbats, clergy, princes, and other faithful people throughout Gaul,\r\nhealth. As you are members of the church of Rome, we are anxious to\r\nsignify to your affection what has there lately taken place. Shortly\r\nafter our election, then, the sovereign emperor coming by stealth\r\nand with unexpected haste to Rome, compelled us to depart the city.\r\nHe afterwards demanded peace by threats and intimidation, saying he\r\nwould do all he might be able, unless we assured him of peace by oath.\r\nTo which we replied thus: Concerning the controversy which exists\r\nbetween the church and the empire, we willingly agree to a meeting\r\nor to legal discussion, at proper time and place; that is to say,\r\neither at Milan or Cremona, on the next feast of St. Luke, at the\r\ndiscretion of our brethren, who, by God, are constituted judges in the\r\nchurch, and without whom this cause cannot be agitated. And since the\r\nsovereign emperor demands security from us, we promise such to him,\r\nby word and by writing, unless in the interim himself shall violate\r\nit: for otherwise to give security is dishonourable to the church, and\r\ncontrary to custom. He, immediately, on the forty-fourth day after our\r\nelection, intruded into the bosom of the church, the bishop of Brague,\r\nwho, the preceding year had been excommunicated by our predecessor\r\npope Paschal, in a council at Benevento; and who had also, when he\r\nformerly received the pall from our hands, sworn fidelity to the same\r\npontiff, and his catholic successors, of whom I am the first. In\r\nthis prodigious crime, however, thanks to God, the sovereign emperor\r\nhad no single Roman associate; only the Guibertines, Romanus of St.\r\nMarcellus, Censius, who was called of St. Chrysogon; Teuzo, who for a\r\nlong time was guilty of many excesses in Dacia; these alone transacted\r\nso shameless a deed. We command your wisdom, therefore, on the receipt\r\nof these presents, that, deliberating on these matters in common, by\r\nthe grace of God, you be prepared, by his help, to avenge the mother\r\nchurch, as you are aware ought to be done by your joint assistance.\r\nDone at Gaeta on the seventeenth before the kalends of February.”\r\n\r\nGelasius after his expulsion, embarking at Salerno, came thence to\r\nGenoa, and afterwards proceeded by land to Clugny, where he died.[517]\r\nThen, that is A.D. 1119, the cardinals who had accompanied him,\r\ntogether with the whole Cisalpine church, elevating with great pomp\r\nGuido, archbishop of Vienne, to the papacy, called him Calixtus;\r\nhoping, from the consideration of his piety and energy, that through\r\nhis power, as he possessed great influence, they might be able\r\nto withstand the force of the emperor. Nor did he deceive their\r\nconfidence: for soon after calling a council at Rheims, he separated\r\nfrom the churches such as had been, or should be, invested by the\r\nlaity, including the emperor also, unless he should recant. Thus\r\ncontinuing for some time in the hither districts, to strengthen his\r\nparty, and having settled all affairs in Gaul, he came to Rome, and\r\nwas gladly received by the citizens, as the emperor had now departed.\r\nBourdin then, deserted, fled to Sutri, determining to nurture his power\r\nby many a pilgrim’s loss; but how he was ejected thence, the following\r\nepistle explains.\r\n\r\n“Calixtus, the bishop, servant of the servants of God, to his beloved\r\nbrethren, and sons, the archbishops, bishops, abbats, priors, and other\r\nfaithful servants of St. Peter, clergy as well as laity, situated\r\nthroughout Gaul, health and apostolical benediction. As the people\r\nhave forsaken the law of the Lord, and walk not in his judgments, God\r\nvisits their iniquities with a rod, and their sins with stripes: but\r\nretaining the bowels of paternal love, he does not desert such as trust\r\nin his mercy. For a long time indeed, their sins so requiring, the\r\nfaithful of the church have been disturbed by Bourdin, that idol of the\r\nking of Germany; nay, some have been taken captive, others afflicted,\r\nthrough want in prison, even unto death. Lately, however, after\r\ncelebrating the festival of Easter, when we could no longer endure the\r\ncomplaints of the pilgrims, and of the poor, we left the city with the\r\nfaithful servants of the church, and laid siege to Sutri, until the\r\nDivine power delivered that Bourdin aforesaid, the enemy of the church,\r\nwho had there made a nest for the devil, as well as the place itself,\r\nentirely into our power. We beg your brotherly love therefore, with us,\r\nto return thanks to the King of kings, for such great benefits, and to\r\nremain most firmly in obedience and duty to the catholic church, as you\r\nwill receive from God Almighty, through his grace, due recompence for\r\nit, both here and hereafter. We beg, too, that these letters be made\r\npublic, with all due diligence. Done at Sutri on the fifth before the\r\nkalends of May.”\r\n\r\nHow exquisite and refined a piece of wit, to call the man he hated, the\r\nidol of the king of Germany! for the emperor certainly held in high\r\nestimation Maurice’s skill in literature and politics. He was, as I\r\nhave said, bishop of Brague, a city of Spain: a man whom any one might\r\nhighly reverence, and almost venerate, for his active and unwearied\r\nassiduity; had he not been led to make himself conspicuous by so\r\ndisgraceful an act: nor would he have hesitated to purchase the holy\r\nsee, if he could have found as desperate a seller as he was a buyer.\r\nBut being taken, and made a monk, he was sent to the Den,[518] for so\r\nis the monastery called.\r\n\r\nThe laudable magnanimity of the pope proceeded still farther in the\r\npromotion of justice, to the end that he might repress the boundless\r\nand innate cupidity of the Romans. In his time there were no snares\r\nlaid for the traveller in the neighbourhood of Rome; no assaults on\r\nhim when he arrived within the city. The offerings to St. Peter,\r\nwhich, through insolence, and for their lusts, the powerful used to\r\npillage, basely injuring such preceding popes as dared to complain,\r\nCalixtus brought back to their proper use; that is to say, for the\r\npublic service of the ruler of the holy see. Neither could the desire\r\nof amassing money, nor the love of it when collected, produce in his\r\nbreast any thing repugnant to justice: so that he admonished the\r\nEnglish pilgrims, on account of the length of the journey, rather to\r\ngo to St. David’s[519] than to Rome; allowing the benefit of the same\r\nbenediction to such as went twice to that place, as resulted to those\r\nwho went once to Rome. Moreover that inveterate controversy between the\r\nempire and the priesthood, concerning investiture, which for more than\r\nfifty years had created commotions, to such a degree, that, when any\r\nfavourer of this heresy was cut off by disease or death, immediately,\r\nlike the hydra’s heads, many sprouted up afresh; this man by his\r\ndiligence cut off, brought low, rooted out, or plucked up: beating down\r\nthe crest of German fierceness by the vigorous stroke of the papal\r\nhatchet. This, the declaration of the emperor, and of the pope, will\r\nshew to the world in the following words:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] POPE CALIXTUS II.]\r\n\r\n“I, Calixtus, bishop, servant of the servants of God, do grant unto\r\nyou, my beloved son, Henry Augustus, by the grace of God, emperor of\r\nthe Romans, that the election of bishops and abbats of the German\r\nempire, who pertain to the regality, shall take place in your presence\r\nwithout simony, or any violence: so that if any discord shall arise\r\nbetween the parties, you may give your assent, or aid, to the worthier\r\nside, by the counsel or judgment of the metropolitan or suffragans: but\r\nthe elect shall receive the royalties from you, and do whatever, by\r\nthese, he is lawfully bound to perform to you: but any one consecrated\r\nin the other parts of the empire, shall, within six months, receive his\r\nroyalties from you, by your sceptre, and do whatever, by these, he is\r\nlawfully bound to perform to you; all things excepted which are known\r\nto belong to the Roman church. Moreover in those matters whereof you\r\nhave complained, and demanded my assistance, I will afford you aid\r\naccording to the duty of my office. I grant firm peace to you and to\r\nall, who are, or were aiding you at the time of this dispute. Farewell.”\r\n\r\n“In the name of the Holy and Undivided Trinity, I Henry Augustus, by\r\nthe grace of God, emperor of the Romans, for the love of God, and of\r\nthe holy Roman church, and of the sovereign pope Calixtus; and for the\r\nrelease of my soul, do grant unto God, and the holy apostles Peter and\r\nPaul, and to the holy catholic church, all investitures by the ring\r\nand staff, and do allow canonical election, and free consecration to\r\ntake place, in all churches of my kingdom or empire. The possessions\r\nand regality of St. Peter, which, from the beginning of this dispute\r\nto the present day, have been taken away, either in my father’s or\r\nmy own time, and which I now hold, I restore to the same holy Roman\r\nchurch: and such as I do not possess, I will faithfully assist her in\r\nrecovering. And of the possessions of all other churches, princes,\r\nand others, clergy as well as lay, which have been forfeited in this\r\ncontention by the advice of my princes, or by course of law, such as I\r\nhave, I will restore; and such as I do not possess, I will faithfully\r\nassist in recovering. And I grant firm peace to the sovereign pope\r\nCalixtus, and to the holy Roman church, and to all, who are, or have\r\nbeen on her side: and I will faithfully assist her in every thing in\r\nwhich she requires assistance: and will afford her due justice in such\r\nmatters whereof she shall have complained. All these affairs were\r\ntransacted by the consent and counsel of the nobility, whose names are\r\nhere subscribed. Albert, archbishop of Mentz: Frederic, archbishop of\r\nCologne: the bishop of Ratisbon: the bishop of Bamburg: Bruno, bishop\r\nof Spires: the bishop of Augsburg: the bishop of Utrecht: the bishop\r\nof Constance: the abbat of Fulda: duke Herman: duke Frederic: Boniface\r\nthe marquis: Theobald the marquis: Ernulf count palatine: Othbert count\r\npalatine: earl Berengar.”\r\n\r\nThe inveterate malady which had disturbed the church being thus\r\ncured, every true Christian greatly rejoiced that this emperor, who,\r\nin military glory trod fast upon the footsteps of Charles the Great,\r\nneither degenerated from his devotion to God: for, in addition to nobly\r\nquelling the rebellions of his German empire, he subdued his Italian\r\ndominions in such wise as none had done before. Entering Italy thrice,\r\nwithin the space of ten years, he restrained the pride of the cities:\r\nat his first coming he exterminated by fire, Novaria, Placentia,\r\nArezzo: at the second, and third, Cremona, and Mantua; and quieted the\r\nsedition at Ravenna, by a siege of a few days’ continuance: for the\r\nPisans and Pavians, with the people of Milan, embraced his friendship,\r\nrather than encounter the weight of his enmity. The daughter of the\r\nking of England, who, as I said before, was married to him, resembled\r\nher father in fortitude, and her mother in sanctity: piety and\r\nassiduity vied with each other in her character, nor was it easy to\r\ndiscern, which of her good qualities was most commendable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] WILLIAM, EARL OF POITOU.]\r\n\r\nAt that time lived William earl of Poitou; a giddy unsettled kind of\r\nman; who, after[520] he returned from Jerusalem, as the preceding\r\nbook relates, wallowed as completely in the sty of vice, as though\r\nhe had believed that all things were governed by chance, and not by\r\nProvidence. Moreover, he rendered his absurdities pleasant, by a kind\r\nof satirical wit: exciting the loud laughter of his hearers. Finally\r\nhe erected, near a castle called Niort, certain buildings after the\r\nform of a little monastery, and used to talk idly about placing\r\ntherein an abbey of prostitutes, naming several of the most abandoned\r\ncourtezans, one as abbess, another as prioress; and declaring that\r\nhe would fill up the rest of the offices in like manner. Repudiating\r\nhis lawful consort, he carried off the wife of a certain viscount, of\r\nwhom he was so desperately enamoured, that he placed on his shield the\r\nfigure of this woman; affirming, that he was desirous of bearing her\r\nin battle, in the same manner as she bore him at another time. Being\r\nreproved and excommunicated for this by Girard bishop of Angouleme, and\r\nordered to renounce this illicit amour, “You shall curl with a comb,”\r\nsaid he, “the hair that has forsaken your forehead, ere I repudiate\r\nthe viscountess;” thus taunting a man, whose scanty hair required no\r\ncomb. Nor did he less when Peter bishop of Poitou, a man of noted\r\nsanctity, rebuked him still more freely; and, when contumacious, began\r\nto excommunicate him publicly: for, becoming furious, he seized the\r\nprelate by the hair, and flourishing his drawn sword: “You shall die\r\nthis instant,” said he, “unless you give me absolution.” The bishop,\r\nthen, counterfeiting alarm, and asking leave to speak, boldly completed\r\nthe remainder of the form of excommunication; suspending the earl so\r\nentirely from all Christian intercourse, that he should neither dare\r\nto associate, nor speak with any one, unless he speedily recanted.\r\nThus fulfilling his duty, as it appeared to him, and thirsting for\r\nthe honour of martyrdom, he stretched out his neck, saying, “Strike,\r\nstrike.” But William, becoming somewhat softened, regained his usual\r\npleasantry, and said, “Certainly I hate you so cordially, that I will\r\nnot dignify you by the effects of my anger, nor shall you ever enter\r\nheaven by the agency of my hand.” After a short time, however, tainted\r\nby the infectious insinuations of this abandoned woman, he drove the\r\nrebuker of his incest into banishment: who there, making a happy end,\r\nmanifested to the world, by great and frequent miracles, how gloriously\r\nhe survives in heaven. On hearing this, the earl abstained not from\r\nhis inconsiderate speeches, openly declaring, that he was sorry he had\r\nnot despatched him before; that so his pure soul might chiefly have to\r\nthank him, through whose violence he had acquired eternal happiness.\r\nThe following verses are a tribute of applause to the life and death of\r\nPeter. It was said of him, when alive,--\r\n\r\n  Coarse food, his body: and the poor, his store\r\n  Consum’d: while study morals gave, and lore.\r\n  Virtues he rear’d, check’d faults, encouraged right,\r\n  And law: in peace, not tumult, did delight.\r\n  Help to the wretch, to sinners pardon gives,\r\n  And, for his friend, his ardour ever lives.\r\n  Busy for man was Martha; Mary’s heart,\r\n  Intent on God, assumed the better part:\r\n  So ’twas in him; for God his soul possess’d,\r\n  Unmix’d: his friendless neighbour had the rest,\r\n  Rachael he lov’d: nor Leah’s hopes depriv’d\r\n  Of joy: another Jacob, doubly-wiv’d;\r\n  Dotes on the one, for beauty’s matchless grace;\r\n  Regards the other, for her numerous race.\r\n\r\nAnd when dead, it was said of him,--\r\n\r\n  Poor and confin’d, and exiled from his see,\r\n  The virtuous prelate bore each injury:\r\n  Now rich, free, fix’d, his suff’rings are made even,\r\n  For Christ he follows, and inherits heaven.\r\n  His life, religion: and a judgment sound,\r\n  His mind adorn’d; his works his fame resound,\r\n  Reading his knowledge, and a golden mean\r\n  His words, arrang’d: in his decisions seen\r\n  Was law: severity his justice arm’d,\r\n  And graceful beauty in his person charm’d:\r\n  His breast was piety’s perpetual stand,\r\n  The pastor’s crosier well-became his hand:\r\n  The pope promotes him, but the earl deprives:\r\n  Through Christ to joy eternal he survives.\r\n\r\nThe contemporaries and associates in religion of this Peter, were\r\nRobert de Arbrisil,[521] and Bernard[522] abbat of Tyron, the first of\r\nwhom was the most celebrated and eloquent preacher of these times: so\r\nmuch did he excel, not in frothy, but honeyed diction, that from the\r\ngifts of persons vying with each other in making presents, he founded\r\nthat noble monastery of nuns at Font-Evraud, in which every secular\r\npleasure being extirpated, no other place possesses such multitudes of\r\ndevout women, fervent in their obedience to God. For in addition to\r\nthe rejection of other allurements, how great is this! that they never\r\nspeak but in the chapter: the rule of constant silence being enjoined\r\nby the superior, because, when this is broken, women are prone to vain\r\ntalk. The other, a noted admirer of poverty, leaving a most opulent\r\nmonastery, retired with a few followers into a woody and sequestered\r\nplace, and there, “As the light could not be hidden under a bushel,”\r\nvast numbers flocking to him, he founded a monastery, more celebrated\r\nfor the piety and number of the monks, than for the splendour and\r\nextent of its riches.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] SERLO, ABBAT OF GLOUCESTER.]\r\n\r\nAnd, that England may not be supposed destitute of virtue, who can\r\npass by Serlo, abbat of Gloucester, who advanced that place, almost\r\nfrom meanness and insignificance, to a glorious pitch? All England is\r\nacquainted with the considerate rule professed at Gloucester, which the\r\nweak may embrace, and the strong cannot despise. Their leader, Serlo’s\r\naxiom, was, “Moderation in all things.” Although mild to the good, he\r\nwas fierce and terrific to the haughty; to corroborate which, I shall\r\ninsert the verses of Godfrey the prior concerning him:--\r\n\r\n  The church’s bulwark fell, when Serlo died,\r\n  Virtue’s sharp sword, and justice’s fond pride:\r\n  Speaker of truth, no vain discourse he lov’d,\r\n  And pleas’d the very princes he reprov’d:\r\n  A hasty judgment, or disorder’d state\r\n  Of life, or morals, were his utter hate.\r\n  The third of March was the propitious day,\r\n  When Serlo wing’d, through death, to life his way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] DEATH OF ST. LANZO.]\r\n\r\nWho can in silence pass Lanzo, who flourished at that time, equal to\r\nany in sanctity? A monk of Clugny, and prior of St. Pancras[523] in\r\nEngland; who, by his worth, so ennobled that place with the grace of\r\nmonastic reverence, that it might be justly declared the peculiar\r\nhabitation of virtue. As nothing I can say will equal the merits of his\r\nlife, I shall merely subjoin, in the language I found it, an account of\r\nhis death; that it may plainly appear, how gloriously he had lived, who\r\ndied so highly favoured.\r\n\r\n“The affectionate Lord who scourges every son whom he receives,--who\r\npromises the just, that they shall be partakers of his sufferings as\r\nwell as of his consolation; permitted Lanzo to approach his death by\r\nsuch bitter sickness, during three days, that if any spot from earthly\r\nintercourse had adhered to his pure soul, it must no doubt have been\r\nwiped away by that suffering. For, as that great apostle, who reclined\r\non the breast of our Lord, says, ‘If we say that we have no sin we\r\ndeceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us;’ and since Christ will\r\njudge every sin, either lightly here or more severely hereafter, he\r\nwas unwilling that any offence should be in the way of him after\r\ndeath, whom he knew to have loved him with all his heart. Wherefore,\r\nif there was anything which he thought worthy of examination in Lanzo,\r\nhe was desirous of consuming it in his lifetime. To this assertion\r\nhis confidence in death bore witness. For when in full health, on the\r\nfifth day of the week before the passion of our Lord, having read\r\nthe psalter, according to the daily custom of Lent, and being about\r\nto celebrate mass at the third hour, he had robed himself to the\r\nchasuble,[524] and had proceeded in the service till mass was on the\r\neve of beginning, he was suddenly seized with such an acute disorder,\r\nthat himself laying aside the garments he had put on, he left them not\r\neven folded up.[525] Departing from the oratory, he was afflicted for\r\ntwo days, without intermission, that is, till the Saturday, having no\r\nrest either sitting, walking, standing, lying, or sleeping. During the\r\nnights, however, he never spoke to his brethren, though entreating\r\nhim to break silence; but to this he did not consent, beseeching them\r\nnot to sully the purity of his vow; for since he had assumed the\r\nmonastic habit, whenever he had gone out from complines, he had never\r\nspoken till primes of the ensuing day. But on the Saturday, though\r\nso convulsed as to expect dissolution every moment, he commanded the\r\nbrethren, now rising for matins, to come and anoint him: and when he\r\nwas anxious to kiss them, after being anointed, as is the custom,\r\nthrough excess of love he saluted them, not lying or sitting, but,\r\nthough agonized to death, standing, supported in their arms. At dawn,\r\nbeing conducted to the chapter-house,[526] when he had taken his seat,\r\nhe asked all the brethren to come before him, and giving them the\r\npaternal benediction and absolution, he entreated the like from them.\r\nHe then instructed them what they were to do in case he died: and\r\nso, returning whence he came, he passed the rest of the day with the\r\nsucceeding Sunday, rather more tranquilly; but, behold, after this,\r\nthat is, after Sunday, signs of approaching death were discovered; and\r\nhaving his hands washed, and his hair combed, he entered the oratory\r\nto hear mass; and receiving the body and blood of the Lord retired to\r\nhis bed. After a short time he became speechless, gave his benediction\r\nto the brethren singly as they came before him, and in like manner\r\nto the whole society. But lifting his eyes to heaven, he attempted\r\nwith both hands to bless the abbat, with all committed to his charge.\r\nBeing entreated by the fraternity to be mindful of them with the Lord,\r\nto whom he was going, he most kindly assented by an inclination of\r\nhis head. After he had done thus, he beckoned for the cross to be\r\npresented to him, which, adoring with his head and indeed with his\r\nwhole body, and embracing with his hands, he appeared to salute with\r\njoyful lips and to kiss with fond affection, when he distressed the\r\nstanders-by with signs of departing, and, being caught up in their\r\narms, was carried yet alive into the presbytery before the altar\r\nof St. Pancras. Here, surviving yet a time, and pleasing from the\r\nrosy hue of his countenance, he departed to Christ, pure, and freed\r\neternally from every evil, at the same hour of the day on which, for\r\nhis purification, he had been stricken with disease. And behold how\r\nwonderfully all things corresponded; the passion of the servant with\r\nthe passion of the Lord; the hour of approaching sickness with the\r\nhour of approaching eternal happiness; the five days of illness which\r\nhe endured for purifying the five senses of the body, through which\r\nnone can avoid sin. Moreover, from his dying ere the completion of the\r\nfifth day, I think it is signified that he had never sinned in the last\r\nsense which is called the touch. And what else can the third hour of\r\nthe day, in which he fell sick, and by dying entered into eternal life,\r\nsignify, than that the same grace of the Holy Spirit, by which we know\r\nhis whole life was regulated, was evidently present to him, both in his\r\nsickness and his death. Besides, we cannot doubt but that he equalled\r\nour fathers Odo and Odilo,[527] both in virtue and in its reward, as a\r\nremarkable circumstance granted to them was allowed to him also. For\r\nas the Lord permitted them to die on the octaves of those festivals\r\nwhich they loved beyond all other, (as St. Odo chiefly loved the feast\r\nof St. Martin, and St. Odilo the nativity of our Lord, and each died\r\non the octaves of these tides), so to Lanzo, who beyond all of this\r\nage observed the rule of St. Benedict, and venerated the holy mother\r\nof God and her solemnities with singular regard, it happened that, as,\r\naccording to his usual custom, both on the demise of St. Benedict,\r\nand on the festival of St. Mary, which is called the Annunciation,\r\nhe celebrated high mass in the convent: so on the eighth from the\r\naforesaid anniversary of St. Benedict, being stricken with sickness,\r\nhe also on the eighth day from the annunciation departed to Christ.\r\nWherefore, he who is unacquainted with the life of Lanzo, may learn\r\nfrom his death, how pleasing it was to God, and will believe with us\r\nthat these things, which I have mentioned, did not happen after the\r\ncommon course of dying persons, as he was a man surpassed by none, in\r\nthe present times, for the gifts of the Holy Spirit.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] GODFREY, PRIOR OF WINTON.]\r\n\r\nNor ought the memory of Godfrey, prior of Winchester, to decay, who\r\nwas celebrated in these times for his learning and his piety: his\r\nlearning is attested by many works and epistles composed in his\r\nfamiliar and pleasing style, but principally by his epigrams, written\r\nafter the manner of satires, and his verses in celebration of the chief\r\npersonages of England.[528] Indeed he restored every divine office to\r\nits native grace, from the manner in which he treated it, though before\r\nit had become obsolete from antiquity. The laws of religion and of\r\nhospitality, already happily traced out, he strongly impressed on the\r\nmonks, who to this day so closely follow the footsteps of the prior in\r\nboth, that they deserve all or nearly all possible commendation; indeed\r\nin this house there is a place of entertainment to any extent, for\r\ntravellers of every description by sea or land, with boundless expense\r\nand ceaseless attention. Among other things this holy man was noted\r\nfor his humility, so that nothing but what savoured of modesty and\r\nsweetness proceeded from this singular depository of philosophy. How\r\ngreat indeed must this commendation seem? for there is hardly any one,\r\neven the least tinctured with learning, who does not appear to consider\r\nothers beneath his dignity, by his haughty gestures and proud gait\r\nproclaiming the consciousness of his own erudition. However, that no\r\nperfection might be wanting to his pure soul, he kept his lowly bed for\r\nmany years, equally consuming his vitals and his transgressions in the\r\nfurnace of lasting sickness.\r\n\r\nBut why should I enlarge on such characters? There were, indeed, at\r\nthat time in England many persons illustrious both for learning and\r\nfor piety, whose virtue was the more commendable in proportion to its\r\nconstancy and vigour in these degenerate times. By a blameless life,\r\ntherefore, they gave credibility to ancient histories, and freed them\r\nfrom any suspicion of falsehood, as they produced modern example of the\r\npossibility of doing what was there recorded. Moreover, were there any\r\nprelates apparently degenerating from the sanctity of ancient times,\r\nthat is to say, skilled in secular, indolent in spiritual matters?\r\nIf there were such, I say, they endeavoured to shade their failings\r\nby costly ornaments for their cathedrals. Each of them erected new\r\nchurches, and adorned the bodies of their saints with silver and gold;\r\nlavish of expense to secure the good opinion of the beholders. Among\r\nthese is Ranulf before-mentioned, who, being made bishop of Durham,\r\npurchased some glory for his name, by new buildings for the monks, and\r\nby regard to St. Cuthbert. His fame is exalted by his translation of\r\nthe holy body, which when taken from its resting-place he exhibited to\r\nall who wished to behold it. Radulf, at that time bishop of Sees, and\r\nafterwards archbishop of Canterbury, with fortunate temerity, handled\r\nand displayed the uncorrupted body; for it had become matter of doubt\r\nwith certain persons whether the miracle of the incorruption of the\r\ncorpse, which had formerly been reported, still had effect. About the\r\nsame time, in the monastery of Ely, under abbat Richard, the virgin\r\nreliques of St. Etheldritha, subjects of amaze and reverence to the\r\nbeholders, were seen entire. This monastery, lately changed by king\r\nHenry into a bishopric, had Hervey, as its first prelate; who, from\r\nthe scantiness of its revenues, had deserted Bangor, where he had\r\nbeen enthroned. And that the bishop of Lincoln might not complain of\r\nthe mutilation of his diocese, the king made up his loss, out of the\r\npossessions of Ely, and satisfied his claim. Indeed, whatever, in his\r\ntime, was unjustly purloined, or violently taken, from the primacy of\r\nthe two metropolitans of Canterbury and York, I will relate in its\r\nproper place. For having now ended the series of the kings, it seems\r\nincumbent on me, to speak of that of the bishops of all England:\r\nand here I wish I had abundant matter for relation, in order that\r\nsuch splendid luminaries of the country might no longer be lost in\r\nobscurity. Moreover, there will perhaps be many in different parts\r\nof England, who may say, that they have heard and read some things\r\ndifferently related from the mode in which I have recorded them: but\r\nif they judge candidly, they will not, on this account, brand me with\r\ncensure: since, following the strict laws of history, I have asserted\r\nnothing but what I have learned either from relators, or writers, of\r\nveracity. But be these matters as they may, I especially congratulate\r\nmyself on being, through Christ’s assistance, the only person, or at\r\nleast the first, who, since Bede, have arranged a continued history of\r\nthe English. Should any one, therefore, as I already hear it intimated,\r\nundertake, after me, a work of a similar nature, he may be indebted to\r\nme for having collected materials, though the selection from them must\r\ndepend upon himself.[529]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1119.] CONCLUSION, TO EARL ROBERT.]\r\n\r\nThus much then, my venerated lord, I have had to relate, concerning the\r\nhistory of the English, from their first arrival in this country, till\r\nthe twentieth year of your father’s most happy reign: the remainder\r\nwill occupy a separate volume, if you condescend a kind regard to\r\nthese. For when I had finished this work, after contemplating many\r\ncharacters, I determined that it ought more especially to be dedicated\r\nto you: as, when I examine others, I observe nobility in one; in\r\nanother military science; in a third learning; justice in a fourth;\r\nbut munificence in few indeed. Thus, I admire some things in one, some\r\nin another; but in you the aggregate of all. For, if ever any man was\r\ntruly noble, you certainly excel in that quality; being descended\r\nfrom the most glorious kings and earls, and resembling them in your\r\ndisposition. From the Normans, therefore, you derive your military\r\nskill; from the Flemings your personal elegance; from the French your\r\nsurpassing munificence. Of your activity in war, who can doubt, when\r\nyour most excellent father himself looks up to it? For whenever any\r\ntumults are reported in Normandy, he despatches you before him, in\r\norder that, what is suspicious may be dispelled by your valour, and\r\npeace may be restored by your sagacity. When he returns to his kingdom,\r\nhe brings you with him, as a safeguard to him abroad, a delight at\r\nhome, and an ornament every where.\r\n\r\nSo devoted are you to literature, that though distracted by such\r\na mass of business, you yet snatch some hours to yourself, for the\r\npurpose either of reading, or of hearing others. Justly do you\r\nregulate, indeed, your exalted rank in life, neither omitting the\r\ntoils of war for literature, nor contemning literature, as some do,\r\nfor military service. Here, also, the excess of your learning appears;\r\nfor, whilst you love books, you manifest how deeply you have drunk\r\nof the stream. For many things, indeed, are eagerly desired when not\r\npossessed, but no person will love philosophy, who shall not have\r\nimbibed it thoroughly. The fame of your justice reaches even our\r\nparts; for a false sentence has never been extorted from you, either\r\nby elevation of rank, or by scantiness of fortune. The person who\r\nwishes to subvert justice, finds in your breast nothing conducive to\r\nhis design, either by the offering of presents, or by the charm of\r\nfavour. Your munificence and disregard of money, is amply shown by\r\nthe monastery of Tewkesbury; from which, as I hear, you not only do\r\nnot extort presents but even return its voluntary offerings. You must\r\nbe well aware, how noble such a proceeding is, more especially at\r\nthe present time; how much it redounds to your glory among men, how\r\nproductive of the favour of God. Happy, then, according to Plato, is\r\nthe republic whose ruler is a philosopher, whose sovereign delights\r\nnot in gifts. More could I add on such subjects, did not the suspicion\r\nof flattery on my part, and commendable modesty on yours, restrain my\r\ntongue. In truth, my design was, not to pass by in silence the things\r\nI have uttered, in order that, by my agency, your worth might reach\r\nposterity; and that it may continue to proceed from virtue to virtue.\r\nMoreover, it was long since my intention, at the instance of certain\r\npersons, to subjoin to this work, whatever I may deem of importance,\r\naccording to the successive years: but it appears advisable rather to\r\nform another volume of such matters, than to be perpetually adding\r\nto that already completed. Nor can any one say, that I engage in a\r\nsuperfluous work, if I record the transactions of the most celebrated\r\namong the kings of his time. Indeed my lowly condition is much indebted\r\nto his greatness, and will be still more so, were it for nothing\r\nelse, than his being able to pride himself on such a son.[530] For,\r\nwhen he had most auspiciously begotten, he first commanded you to be\r\ninstructed, not superficially, as plainly appears at the present day,\r\nin science; he next made you master of a most princely fortune; and, at\r\nthis moment he reposes his paternal regards upon you. Let this volume\r\nthen, whatever its merits or defects, be altogether dedicated to your\r\nfame; in the next my life and my history will terminate together.\r\nFarther, kindly accept this my offering, that I, whose judgment has not\r\nerred in its choice, may be gratified by the good wishes of my patron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MODERN HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE,\r\n\r\nADDRESSED TO ROBERT, EARL OF GLOUCESTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo his most loving lord, Robert, son of king Henry, and earl of\r\nGloucester, William, librarian of Malmesbury, wishes, after completing\r\nhis victorious course on earth, eternal triumph in heaven. Many of the\r\ntransactions of your father, of glorious memory, I have not omitted to\r\nrecord, both in the fifth book of my Regal History, and in those three\r\nsmaller volumes, which I have intituled Chronicles.[531] Your highness\r\nis now desirous that those events which, through the miraculous\r\npower of God, have taken place in modern time, in England, should be\r\ntransmitted to posterity: truly, like all your other desires, a most\r\nnoble one. For what more concerns the advancement of virtue; what\r\nmore conduces to justice; than to recognize the divine favour towards\r\ngood men, and his vengeance upon the wicked? What, too, can be more\r\ngrateful, than to commit to the page of history, the exploits of brave\r\nmen, by whose example others may shake off their indolence, and take up\r\narms in defence of their country? As this task is committed to my pen,\r\nI think the narrative will proceed with exacter order, if, going back a\r\nlittle, I trace the series of years from the return of the empress into\r\nEngland, after the death of her husband. First, therefore, invoking\r\nthe help of God, as is fitting, and purposing to write the truth,\r\nwithout listening to enmity, or sacrificing to favour, I shall begin as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1126.] THE EMPRESS MATILDA.]\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-sixth year of Henry king of England, which was A.D.\r\n1126, Henry, emperor of Germany, to whom Matilda the aforesaid king’s\r\ndaughter had been married, died[532] in the very bloom of his life and\r\nof his conquests. Our king was at that time residing in Normandy, to\r\nquell whatever tumults might arise in those parts. As soon as he heard\r\nof the death of his son-in-law, he recalled his daughter by honourable\r\nmessengers despatched for that purpose. The empress, as they say,\r\nreturned with reluctance, as she had become habituated to the country\r\nwhich was her dowry, and had large possessions there. It is well known,\r\nthat several princes of Lorraine and Lombardy came, during succeeding\r\nyears, repeatedly into England, to demand her as their sovereign;\r\nbut they lost the fruit of their labours, the king designing, by the\r\nmarriage of his daughter, to procure peace between himself and the earl\r\nof Anjou. He was certainly, in an extraordinary degree, the greatest of\r\nall kings in the memory either of ourselves, or of our fathers: and yet\r\nnevertheless, he ever, in some measure, dreaded the power of the earls\r\nof Anjou. Hence it arose, that he broke off and annulled the espousals\r\nwhich William, his nephew, afterwards earl of Flanders, was said to be\r\nabout to contract with the daughter of Fulco, earl of Anjou, who was\r\nafterwards king of Jerusalem. Hence, too, it arose, that he united a\r\ndaughter of the same earl to his son William, while yet a stripling;\r\nand hence it was, that he married his daughter, of whom we began to\r\nspeak, after her imperial match, to a son of the same Fulco, as my\r\nnarrative will proceed to disclose.\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-seventh year of his reign, in the month of September,\r\nking Henry came to England, bringing his daughter with him. But, at the\r\nensuing Christmas, convening a great number of the clergy and nobility\r\nat London, he gave the county of Salop to his wife, the daughter of\r\nthe earl of Louvain, whom he had married after the death of Matilda.\r\nDistressed that this lady had no issue, and fearing lest she should\r\nbe perpetually childless, with well-founded anxiety, he turned his\r\nthoughts on a successor to the kingdom. On which subject, having held\r\nmuch previous and long-continued deliberation, he now at this council\r\ncompelled all the nobility of England, as well as the bishops and\r\nabbats, to make oath, that, if he should die without male issue, they\r\nwould, without delay or hesitation, accept his daughter Matilda, the\r\nlate empress, as their sovereign: observing, how prejudicially to the\r\ncountry fate had snatched away his son William, to whom the kingdom by\r\nright had pertained: and, that his daughter still survived, to whom\r\nalone the legitimate succession belonged, from her grandfather, uncle,\r\nand father, who were kings; as well as from her maternal descent for\r\nmany ages back: inasmuch as from Egbert, king of the West Saxons,\r\nwho first subdued or expelled the other kings of the island, in the\r\nyear of the incarnation 800,[533] through a line of fourteen kings,\r\ndown to A.D. 1043, in which king Edward, who lies at Westminster, was\r\nelevated to the throne, the line of royal blood did never fail, nor\r\nfalter in the succession.[534] Moreover, Edward, the last, and at the\r\nsame time the most noble, of that stock, had united[535] Margaret,\r\nhis grand-niece by his brother Edmund Ironside, to Malcolm, king of\r\nScotland, whose daughter Matilda, as was well known, was the empress’s\r\nmother. All therefore, in this council, who were considered as persons\r\nof any note, took the oath: and first of all William, archbishop of\r\nCanterbury; next the other bishops, and the abbats in like manner.\r\nThe first of the laity, who swore, was David, king of Scotland, uncle\r\nof the empress; then Stephen, earl of Moreton and Boulogne, nephew\r\nof king Henry by his sister Adala; then Robert, the king’s son, who\r\nwas born to him before he came to the throne, and whom he had created\r\nearl of Gloucester,[536] bestowing on him in marriage Mabil, a noble\r\nand excellent woman; a lady devoted to her husband, and blessed in a\r\nnumerous and beautiful offspring. There was a singular dispute, as\r\nthey relate, between Robert and Stephen, contending with rival virtue,\r\nwhich of them should take the oath first; one alleging the privilege\r\nof a son, the other the dignity of a nephew. Thus all being bound by\r\nfealty and by oath, they, at that time, departed to their homes; but\r\nafter Pentecost, the king sent his daughter into Normandy, ordering\r\nher to be betrothed,[537] by the archbishop of Rouen, to the son of\r\nFulco aforesaid, a youth of high nobility and noted courage. Nor did\r\nhe himself delay setting sail for Normandy, for the purpose of uniting\r\nthem in wedlock. Which being completed, all declared prophetically,\r\nas it were, that, after his death, they would break their plighted\r\noath. I have frequently heard Roger, bishop of Salisbury, say, that he\r\nwas freed from the oath he had taken to the empress: for that he had\r\nsworn conditionally, that the king should not marry his daughter to\r\nany one out of the kingdom without his consent, or that of the rest of\r\nthe nobility: that none of them advised the match, or indeed knew of\r\nit, except Robert, earl of Gloucester, and Brian Fitzcount, and the\r\nbishop of Louviers. Nor do I relate this merely because I believe the\r\nassertion of a man who knew how to accommodate himself to every varying\r\ntime, as fortune ordered it; but, as an historian of veracity, I write\r\nthe general belief of the people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1128.] OF THE SUCCESSION.]\r\n\r\nThe remaining years of the life and reign of Henry, I must review\r\nbriefly, in order that posterity may neither be defrauded of a\r\nknowledge of these events, nor that I may seem to dwell on topics\r\nlittle relevant to this history. In his twenty-eighth year, the\r\nking[538] returned from Normandy; in his twenty-ninth, a circumstance\r\noccurred in England which may seem surprising to our long-haired\r\ngallants, who, forgetting what they were born, transform themselves\r\ninto the fashion of females, by the length of their locks. A certain\r\nEnglish knight, who prided himself on the luxuriancy of his tresses,\r\nbeing stung by conscience on the subject, seemed to feel in a dream\r\nas though some person strangled him with his ringlets. Awaking in a\r\nfright, he immediately cut off all his superfluous hair. The example\r\nspread throughout England; and, as recent punishment is apt to affect\r\nthe mind, almost all military men allowed their hair to be cropped\r\nin a proper manner, without reluctance. But this decency was not of\r\nlong continuance; for scarcely had a year expired, ere all who thought\r\nthemselves courtly, relapsed into their former vice: they vied with\r\nwomen in length of locks, and wherever they were defective, put on\r\nfalse tresses; forgetful, or rather ignorant, of the saying of the\r\napostle, “If a man nurture his hair, it is a shame to him.”[539]\r\n\r\nIn his thirtieth year, king Henry went into Normandy. Pope Honorius\r\ndying in this year, the church of Rome was agitated by great\r\ncontentions about electing his successor. There were, at that time,\r\nin the city, two very celebrated cardinals, Gregory, deacon of St.\r\nAngelo, and Peter, cardinal-priest, son of Leo, prince of the Romans;\r\nboth noted for learning, and activity, nor could the people easily\r\ndiscern which of them more justly ought to be elected by the clergy.\r\nThe party, however, which favoured Gregory took the lead, and ordaining\r\nhim pope, called him Innocent. Moreover a rumour was disseminated among\r\nthe people, that Honorius was still just alive, and had commanded this\r\nto be done. The promoters of this choice were, William, bishop of\r\nPræneste, Matthew of Albano, Conrad of Sabina, John of Ostia, Peter of\r\nCrema, cardinal of St. Chrysogonus, and Haimer the chancellor. But the\r\nother party, after Honorius was buried, at the instigation of Peter’s\r\nbrothers, who were the most opulent and powerful of the Romans, having\r\nelected and consecrated him, gave him the name of Anaclet. The chief\r\nadviser and instigator to this ordination was Peter, bishop of Porto,\r\nwhose letter, if I subjoin it, will disclose the whole controversy;\r\nalthough it inclines rather to Anaclet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1130.] OF THE POPE’S ELECTION.]\r\n\r\n“Peter, bishop of Porto, to the four bishops, William of Præneste,\r\nMatthew of Albano, Conrad of Sabina, John of Ostia. How great is the\r\ntribulation of my heart for you, he only knows, who knows all things;\r\nindeed, you would have already been acquainted with it, in part, by my\r\nletters, did not the sentence and the common authority of the church\r\nprohibit. Of the praise or dispraise of those persons, concerning whom\r\nvarious discourses are at present held, it is not of this world to\r\njudge: there is who may seek and judge. But if any be ready to accuse,\r\none will be ready, and who is also bound, to reply; more especially\r\nwhen both in your and my sight, and in that of the whole church, each\r\nof them has lived discreetly and honestly; and has hitherto executed\r\nhis office impartially. It rather concerns you to abstain from idle\r\nlanguage and the words of haste. If the question be of report, the\r\nbusiness is far different from what your letters to me declare. In\r\naddition to this, if you regard the accounts you have published, and\r\nthe order of proceeding, with due reverence be it spoken, by what\r\nboldness, by what assurance, do you presume to call that usurpation of\r\nyours an election? Why do you call that man of yours ordained, when\r\nthere was no order whatever in his case? Have you so learned to elect\r\na pope? What, in a corner, in a hidden place, in darkness, and in the\r\nshadow of death? If you were desirous that a living should succeed to\r\na dead pope, why would you give out that the deceased was still alive?\r\nIt were much better, surely, to pay the last sad offices to the dead,\r\nand in this manner provide for the succour of the living: but, behold,\r\nwhile you seek succour for the living from the dead, you destroy both\r\nthe living and the dead at the same time. Lastly, it was neither your\r\noffice nor mine to elect; but rather to refuse, or to approve, when\r\nelected by the brethren. Since, therefore, in neglect of the ritual,\r\ncontempt of the canon, and disregard of the very anathema, framed\r\nby yourselves; without consulting me, your superior, or your elder\r\nbrethren and superiors, or even summoning, or waiting for them; when\r\nyou were inexperienced, and but very few in number, you have presumed\r\nto do this; you must be sensible, from your own estimation of the case,\r\nthat it must be considered void and of no avail whatever. The Lord,\r\nhowever, was quickly present to us, and pointed out a method whereby\r\nto obviate your error. For, indeed, your brethren the cardinals, who\r\npossess the chief power of electing, together with the whole clergy,\r\nat the request of the people, and with the consent of the nobility,\r\nopenly, in the light of day, have unanimously, and heartily, elected\r\nthe noble cardinal Peter, as Roman pontiff, by the title of Anaclet.\r\nI have witnessed this election canonically celebrated; and confirmed\r\nit by the authority of God. The church accepts and venerates him; and,\r\nby the grace of God, the bishops and abbats, chief princes and barons,\r\nsome by themselves, and others by their delegates, acknowledge him in\r\nour presence. The robbery and cruelty you mention, I do not perceive:\r\nwhoever goes to him for consultation, or on business, is kindly\r\nreceived, and still more kindly dismissed. Return, then, return to your\r\nunderstanding, do not make a schism in the church, to the perdition of\r\nsouls: do not persist any farther; let the fear of God possess you,\r\nnot worldly shame: does any sleep, will he not add, that he must rise\r\nagain? Cease now from lies, in which the wicked put their hope. The\r\nlord Tiburtius hath testified by oath, in writing, that I have deemed\r\nthe deacon of St. Angelo, the only fit person for the office of pope:\r\nlet him look to what he hath said: I have spoken nothing in secret; no\r\nperson hath ever heard such a word as this from my mouth. My opinion\r\nalways was, that till the pope was buried no mention should be made of\r\nhis successor. I have held, and will hold, the unity of the church; I\r\nwill be careful to adhere to truth and justice; confidently hoping,\r\nthat truth and justice will set me free.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1131.] DEATH OF ANACLET.]\r\n\r\nAfter this manner wrote the aforesaid Peter, bishop of Porto, rather\r\npartial to Peter, the son of Leo. Nor did the other party at all give\r\nway; but called Peter himself a lion’s whelp,[540] and his partizans,\r\nthe leaders of a faction. And they, indeed, acted variously among\r\nthemselves, under these doubtful circumstances. Innocent, however,\r\nexcluded from Rome, passed the Alps and went into France. Here he was\r\nimmediately received by all the churches on this side the mountains;\r\nand moreover, even king Henry, who did not very well know how to be\r\ndriven from an opinion he had once taken up, willingly acknowledged\r\nhim at Chartres; and, at Rouen, condescended to honour him, not only\r\nwith presents from himself, but also from the nobility, and even the\r\nJews. Yet Innocent, though greatly assisted by the kings of England and\r\nFrance, and the emperor of Germany, could never enjoy peace so long as\r\nAnaclet occupied the see of Rome. However, Anaclet himself dying in the\r\neighth year of his usurped papacy, as it was called, Innocent enjoys\r\nthe papal dignity unmolested to the present time.[541]\r\n\r\nIn the thirty-first year of his reign, king Henry returned to England.\r\nThe empress, too, in the same year, arrived on her native soil, and a\r\nfull meeting of the nobility being held at Northampton, the oath of\r\nfidelity to her was renewed by such as had already sworn, and also\r\ntaken by such as hitherto had not. In the same year[542] Lewis, king\r\nof France, growing aged and unwieldy through extreme corpulency,\r\ncommanded his son to be crowned as successor to the kingdom; who dying\r\nsoon after by the fall of his horse, he caused another of his sons to\r\nbe consecrated king, by the hands of the Roman pontiff. He, as they\r\nrelate, not degenerating from the ancient valour of the French, hath\r\nalso acquired Aquitain, as the marriage portion of his wife, which, it\r\nis well known, the kings of France have never held in their own right\r\nsince Lewis, son of Charles the Great.\r\n\r\nIn the thirty-first[543] [second] year of king Henry, a dreadful\r\nmurrain among domestic animals extended over the whole of England.\r\nEntire herds of swine suddenly perished; whole stalls of oxen were\r\nswept off in a moment: the same contagion continued in the following\r\nyears, so that no village throughout the kingdom was free from this\r\ncalamity, or able to exult at the losses of its neighbours. At this\r\ntime, too, the contention between Bernard, bishop of St. David’s, and\r\nUrban, of Landaff, on the rights of their dioceses, which Urban had\r\nillegally usurped, was finally put to rest. For, after being agitated\r\nby so many appeals to the court of Rome, so many expensive journeys,\r\nso many debates of lawyers, for a number of years, it was at last\r\nterminated, or rather cut short, by the death of Urban at Rome. The\r\npope also, weighing the equity of the case, did justice to the piety\r\nand right of the bishop of St. David’s by a suitable judgment. In the\r\nsame year William, archbishop of Canterbury, personally obtained the\r\nlegation of England, through the indulgence of the see of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe day after the thirty-second[544] year of his reign was completed,\r\nHenry, on the nones of August, the very day on which he had formerly\r\nbeen crowned at Westminster, set sail for Normandy. This was the last,\r\nthe fatal voyage of his reign. The providence of God, at that time,\r\nbore reference in a wonderful manner to human affairs: for instance,\r\nthat he should embark, never to return alive, on that day on which he\r\nhad originally been crowned, so long and prosperously to reign. It was\r\nthen, as I have said, the nones of August; and, on the fourth day of\r\nthe week, the elements manifested their sorrow at this great man’s last\r\ndeparture. For the sun on that day,[545] at the sixth hour, shrouded\r\nhis glorious face, as the poets say, in hideous darkness, agitating the\r\nhearts of men by an eclipse: and on the sixth day of the week, early in\r\nthe morning, there was so great an earthquake, that the ground appeared\r\nabsolutely to sink down; a horrid sound being first heard from beneath\r\nthe surface. During the eclipse I saw stars around the sun: and, at the\r\ntime of the earthquake, the wall of the house in which I was sitting\r\nwas lifted up by two shocks, and settled again with a third. The king,\r\ntherefore, continued in Normandy for the space of three[546] whole\r\nyears, and so much longer, as from the nones of August, on which day,\r\nas has been said, he crossed the sea, to the kalends of December, on\r\nwhich night he died. Doubtlessly he performed many things worthy of\r\nrecord while in Normandy, but it was my design to omit whatever did not\r\ncome authenticated to my knowledge. Divers expectations of his return\r\nto England were all frustrated, by some adverse fate, or by the will of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\nHe reigned, then, thirty-five years, and from the nones of August to\r\nthe kalends of December, that is, four months, wanting four days.\r\nEngaged in hunting at Lihun, he was taken suddenly ill. His malady\r\nincreasing, he summoned to him, Hugo, whom, from prior of Lewes, he\r\nhad made abbat of Reading, and afterwards archbishop of Rouen, who was\r\njustly indebted to him and his heirs for such great favours. The report\r\nof his sickness quickly gathered the nobility around him. Robert, too,\r\nhis son, the earl of Gloucester, was present; who, from his unblemished\r\nfidelity and matchless virtue, has deserved to be especially signalized\r\nthroughout all ages. Being interrogated by these persons, as to his\r\nsuccessor, he awarded all his territories, on either side of the sea,\r\nto his daughter, in legitimate and perpetual succession; being somewhat\r\ndispleased with her husband, as he had irritated him both by threats\r\nand by certain injuries. Having passed the seventh day of his sickness,\r\nhe yielded to nature about midnight. I waive describing his magnanimous\r\ncharacter in this place, as I have been diffuse upon it in the fifth\r\nbook of my Regal History. In how Christian a manner he departed, the\r\nfollowing epistle of the aforesaid archbishop of Rouen, will testify.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1093.] DEATH OF HENRY I.]\r\n\r\n“To his lord and father, pope Innocent, due obedience from his\r\nservant, Hugo, priest of Rouen. I have deemed it proper to write to\r\nyour fatherly affection concerning the king my master, never to be\r\nremembered but with grief: for, being seized with sudden sickness, he\r\nwished for me to console his sufferings, and sent messengers as soon\r\nas possible for that purpose. I went, and passed three melancholy days\r\nwith him. Agreeably to my suggestion, he confessed his sins, he beat\r\nhis breast, and he laid aside all his animosities. Through the grace\r\nof God, and through our advice and that of the bishops, he promised\r\nto attend to the amendment of his life. Under this promise, according\r\nto our office, on the third day, and three days successively, we gave\r\nhim absolution. He devoutly adored the cross of our Lord, received his\r\nbody and blood; bestowed his alms thus; saying, ‘Let my debts be paid,\r\nlet the wages[547] and stipends which I owe be discharged, let the\r\nremainder be distributed to the poor.’ I wish they who held, and do\r\nhold, his treasures had done thus. At last I earnestly stated to him\r\nour duty concerning the unction of the sick, which the church adopted\r\nfrom the apostle St. James, and, at his own devout request, I anointed\r\nhim with holy oil. Thus he rested in peace; and may God grant him the\r\npeace he loved.” These circumstances relating to the faith of king\r\nHenry when dying, were truly attested by the aforesaid archbishop of\r\nRouen.\r\n\r\nThe body, royally attended and borne by the nobility in turn, was\r\nbrought to Rouen; where, in a certain retired part of the principal\r\nchurch, it was embowelled, lest, through time, becoming putrid, it\r\nshould offend the senses of those who approached it. The intestines\r\nwere buried in the monastery of St. Mary des Prees, near the city,\r\nwhich, as I hear, he had honoured with no mean presents, as it\r\nhad been begun by his mother. His body was kept at Caen, till the\r\nseason, which was then very boisterous, became more tranquil. In\r\nthe meantime, Stephen earl of Moreton and Boulogne, nephew of king\r\nHenry, as I have before said, who, after the king of Scotland, was\r\nthe first layman that had sworn fidelity to the empress, hastened his\r\nreturn into England by Whitsand. The empress, from certain causes, as\r\nwell as her brother, Robert earl of Gloucester, and almost all the\r\nnobility, delayed returning to the kingdom. However, some castles in\r\nNormandy, the principal of which was Danfrunt, espoused the party of\r\nthe heiress. Moreover, it is well known, that, on the day on which\r\nStephen disembarked in England, there was, very early in the morning,\r\ncontrary to the nature of winter in these countries, a terrible peal\r\nof thunder, with most dreadful lightning, so that the world seemed\r\nwell-nigh about to be dissolved. He was received, however, as king,\r\nby the people of London and of Winchester, and gained over also Roger\r\nbishop of Salisbury, and William Pont de L’Arche, the keepers of the\r\nroyal treasures. Yet, not to conceal the truth from posterity, all\r\nhis attempts would have been vain, had not his brother, Henry bishop\r\nof Winchester, who is now legate of the papal see in England, granted\r\nhim his entire support: allured indeed by the fullest expectation that\r\nStephen would follow the example of his grandfather William in the\r\nmanagement of the kingdom, and more especially in the strictness of\r\necclesiastical discipline. In consequence, when Stephen was bound by\r\nthe rigorous oath which William archbishop of Canterbury required from\r\nhim, concerning restoring and preserving the liberty of the church, the\r\nbishop of Winchester became his pledge and surety. The written tenor of\r\nthis oath, I shall be careful hereafter to insert in its proper place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1135.] STEPHEN, KING OF ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nStephen, therefore, was crowned king of England on Sunday the\r\neleventh[548] before the kalends of January, the twenty-second day\r\nafter the decease of his uncle, anno Dom. 1135, in the presence of\r\nthree bishops, that is, the archbishop, and those of Winchester and\r\nSalisbury; but there were no abbats, and scarcely any of the nobility.\r\nHe was a man of activity, but imprudent: strenuous in war; of great\r\nmind in attempting works of difficulty; mild and compassionate to his\r\nenemies, and affable to all. Kind, as far as promise went; but sure\r\nto disappoint in its truth and execution. Whence he soon afterwards\r\nneglected the advice of his brother, befriended by whose assistance, as\r\nI have said, he had supplanted his adversaries and obtained the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 1135, on the prevalence of gentler gales, the\r\nbody of king Henry was, immediately after Christmas, put on ship-board,\r\nand brought to England; and, in the presence of his successor in the\r\nkingdom, was buried at the monastery of Reading, which he had liberally\r\nendowed, and filled with an order of monks of singular piety. Shortly\r\nafter, a little before Lent, king Stephen went into Northumberland,\r\nthat he might have a conference with David king of Scotland, who\r\nwas said to entertain hostile sentiments towards him. From David he\r\nreadily obtained what he wished; because, being softened by the natural\r\ngentleness of his manners, or by the approach of old age, he willingly\r\nembraced the tranquillity of peace, real or pretended.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, after Easter, Robert earl of Gloucester, of whose\r\nprudence Stephen chiefly stood in awe, came to England. While he was\r\nyet resident in Normandy, he had most earnestly considered, what line\r\nof conduct he should determine upon in the present state of affairs.\r\nIf he became subject to Stephen, it seemed contrary to the oath he had\r\nsworn to his sister; if he opposed him, he saw that he could nothing\r\nbenefit her or his nephews, though he must grievously injure himself.\r\nFor the king, as I said before, had an immense treasure, which his\r\nuncle had been accumulating for many years. His coin, and that of the\r\nbest quality,[549] was estimated at a hundred thousand pounds; besides\r\nwhich, there were vessels of gold and silver, of great weight, and\r\ninestimable value, collected by the magnificence of preceding kings,\r\nand chiefly by Henry.[550] A man possessed of such boundless treasures,\r\ncould not want supporters, more especially as he was profuse, and, what\r\nby no means becomes a prince, even prodigal. Soldiers of all kinds, and\r\nlight-armed troops, were flocking to him, chiefly from Flanders and\r\nBrittany. These were a most rapacious and violent race of men; who made\r\nno scruple to violate church-yards,[551] or rob a church. Moreover, not\r\nonly would they drag men of the religious order from their horses, but\r\nalso make them captive: and this was done not merely by foreigners, but\r\neven by the native soldiers, who had abhorred the tranquillity of king\r\nHenry’s time, because it subjected them to a life of poverty. All these\r\nmost readily resorted to the prince whom they could easily incline to\r\ntheir purposes, pushing their fortune at the expense of the people.\r\nStephen, indeed, before he came to the throne, from his complacency\r\nof manners, and readiness to joke, and sit, and regale, even with\r\nlow people, had gained so much on their affections, as is hardly to\r\nbe conceived: and already had all the nobility of England willingly\r\nacknowledged him. The most prudent earl therefore was extremely\r\ndesirous to convince them of their misconduct, and recall them to\r\nwiser sentiments by his presence; for, to oppose Stephen’s power, he\r\nwas unable, from the causes aforesaid: indeed he had not the liberty\r\nof coming to England, unless, appearing as a partaker of their revolt,\r\nhe dissembled for a time his secret intentions. He did homage to the\r\nking, therefore, under a certain condition; namely, so long as he\r\nshould preserve his rank entire, and maintain his engagements to him;\r\nfor having long since scrutinized Stephen’s disposition, he foresaw the\r\ninstability of his faith.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1135.] KING STEPHEN’S CHARTER.]\r\n\r\nIn the same year, soon after the earl’s arrival, the bishops swore\r\nfidelity to the king, “so long as he should maintain the liberty of\r\nthe church, and the vigour of its discipline.” He himself also swore\r\naccording to the tenor of the following instrument.\r\n\r\n“I Stephen, by the grace of God, elected king of England by the consent\r\nof the clergy and of the people, and consecrated by the lord William,\r\narchbishop of Canterbury and legate of the holy Roman church, and\r\nafterwards confirmed by Innocent, pope of the holy Roman see, through\r\nrespect and love towards God, do grant the holy church to be free,\r\nand confirm to it all due reverence. I promise that I will neither do\r\nany thing simoniacally, nor permit it to be done, in the church, or\r\nin matters ecclesiastical. The jurisdiction and power over beneficed\r\nclergy, and over all persons in orders, and their property, and the\r\ndistribution of effects of ecclesiastics, I admit to be in the hands\r\nof the bishops, and confirm it so to be. I grant and appoint, that the\r\nimmunities of the churches, confirmed by their charters, and their\r\ncustoms observed from ancient usage, do remain inviolate. All the\r\npossessions of the churches, and the tenures which they held during the\r\nlife, and at the death of my grandfather king William, I grant to them\r\nfree, and discharged from the claim of all parties: but if the church\r\nshall hereafter claim any thing held, or possessed, before the death\r\nof the king, of which it is now deprived, I reserve such matter for\r\ndiscussion, or restitution at my will and pleasure. Moreover, whatever,\r\nsince that king’s death, has been obtained by the liberality of kings,\r\nor the gift of princes; by offerings, or purchase, or by any exchange\r\nof the faithful, I confirm. I pledge myself to keep peace, and do\r\njustice to all, and to preserve them to my utmost ability. I reserve\r\nto myself the forests which king William, my grandfather, and William\r\nthe Second, my uncle, have made and possessed: all the rest which king\r\nHenry added, I give and grant, without molestation, to the churches,\r\nand the kingdom. And if any bishop or abbat, or other ecclesiastical\r\nperson, shall have severally distributed[552] his property before his\r\ndeath, or appointed such distribution, I allow it to remain good:\r\nbut if he shall have been suddenly seized by death, before making a\r\ndisposition, let the said distribution be made, at the discretion of\r\nthe church, for the repose of his soul. Moreover, when the sees shall\r\nbe vacant, let both them, and their whole possessions, be committed\r\ninto the hands and custody of the clergy, or of lawful men of the same\r\nchurch, until a pastor be canonically appointed. I entirely do away\r\nall exactions, mischeningas,[553] and injustices, whether illegally\r\nintroduced by the sheriffs, or any one else. I will observe the good\r\nand ancient laws, and just customs, in murders, pleas, and other\r\ncauses, and I command and appoint them to be so observed. Done at\r\nOxford, A.D. 1136, in the first year of my reign.”\r\n\r\nThe names of the witnesses, who were numerous, I disdain to\r\nparticularize, because he as basely perverted almost every thing, as if\r\nhe had sworn only that he might manifest himself a violator of his oath\r\nto the whole kingdom. This easy man must pardon me for speaking the\r\ntruth; who, had he entered on the sovereignty lawfully, and not given a\r\nready ear to the insinuations of the malevolent in the administration\r\nof it, would have wanted little in any princely quality. Under him,\r\ntherefore, the treasures of several churches were pillaged, and their\r\nlanded possessions given to laymen; the churches of the clergy were\r\nsold to foreigners; the bishops made captive, or forced to alienate\r\ntheir property; the abbeys given to improper persons, either through\r\nthe influence of friendship, or for the discharge of debts. Still I\r\nthink such transactions are not so much to be ascribed to him as to his\r\nadvisers; who persuaded him, that, he ought never to want money, so\r\nlong as the monasteries were stored with treasure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1137.] THE KING LEAVES ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 1137, in the beginning of Lent, the king\r\ncrossed the sea. The earl, too, having thoroughly sounded, and\r\ndiscovered the inclinations of such as he knew to be tenacious of\r\ntheir plighted oath, and arranged what he conceived proper to be done\r\nafterwards, himself embarked on Easter-day, and prosperously reached\r\nthe continent. Not long after, he had very nearly experienced the\r\nmalignity of adverse fortune: for the king endeavoured to intercept\r\nhim by treachery, at the instigation of one William de Ipres. The\r\nearl, however, informed of it by one of the accomplices, avoided the\r\nsnare prepared for him, and absented himself from the palace, whither\r\nhe was repeatedly invited, for several days. The king, troubled at\r\nhaving succeeded so little by his artifices, and thinking to effect his\r\ndesign by cunning, endeavoured, by a serene countenance and unrequired\r\nconfession, to extenuate the enormity of his crime. He swore, in words\r\nframed at the earl’s pleasure, never again to give countenance to such\r\nan outrage: and still more to recover his good graces, he confirmed\r\nhis oath, by Hugo, archbishop of Rouen, giving his hand to Robert. This\r\nhe did, it is true; but he never bestowed his unreserved friendship\r\non that man, of whose power he was ever apprehensive. Thus, in his\r\npresence he would pleasantly and affably call him “earl:” when he was\r\nabsent, he would vilify him, and would deprive him, clandestinely, of\r\nsuch portions of his estates as he was able. Robert, too, artfully\r\neluding his duplicity, disguised his feelings, and allowing the king to\r\ndepart peaceably to his kingdom, continued in Normandy, intent on his\r\nown concerns. Wherefore while Stephen, perplexed by many commotions in\r\nEngland, and first attacking one, and then another, justly verified,\r\nwhat was said of Ishmael, “That the hands of all were against him, and\r\nhis hand against all,” Robert passed that whole year in Normandy in\r\nperfect quiet. The king pointedly, as it is reported, used frequently\r\nto say of his rebellious subjects, “Since they have elected me king,\r\nwhy do they desert me? By the birth of God, I will never be called a\r\nfallen king!” Robert, placed, as it were, on an eminence, watched the\r\nevent of circumstances, and earnestly revolved how he might escape,\r\nbefore God and man, the imputation of falsifying the oath he had sworn\r\nto his sister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1139.] TROUBLES IN ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord 1138, England was shaken with intestine\r\ncommotions. For many persons, emboldened to illegal acts, either by\r\nnobility of descent or by ambition, or rather by unbridled heat of\r\nyouth, were not ashamed, some to demand castles, others estates,\r\nand indeed whatever came into their fancy, from the king. When he\r\ndelayed complying with their requests, alleging the dismemberment\r\nof his kingdom, or that others would make similar claims, or were\r\nalready in possession of them; they, becoming enraged immediately,\r\nfortified their castles against him, and drove away large booties from\r\nhis lands. Nor, indeed, was his spirit at all broken by the revolt\r\nof any, but attacking them suddenly in different places, he always\r\nconcluded matters more to his own disadvantage than to theirs; for,\r\nafter many great but fruitless labours, he gained from them, by the\r\ngrant of honours or castles, a peace, feigned only for a time. He\r\ncreated likewise many earls,[554] where there had been none before,\r\nappropriating to them possessions and rents, which rightfully belonged\r\nto the crown. They were the more greedy in asking, and he the more\r\nprofuse in giving, because a rumour was pervading England, that Robert\r\nearl of Gloucester, who was in Normandy, would shortly espouse the\r\ncause of his sister, after first renouncing his fealty to the king.\r\nThis report was in fact well-founded: for shortly after Pentecost,\r\ndespatching some of his people to Stephen from Normandy, he, according\r\nto ancient usage, renounced his fealty and friendship, and disannulled\r\nhis homage; assigning as a just reason for so doing, that the king had\r\nillegally aspired to the kingdom, and neglected his plighted faith to\r\nhim, not to say absolutely belied it: and, moreover, that he himself\r\nhad acted contrary to law; who, after the oath sworn to his sister, had\r\nnot blushed to do homage to another, during her lifetime. Doubtless\r\nalso his mind was biassed by the answers of many ecclesiastics, whom\r\nhe had consulted upon the subject; who declared that he could by no\r\nmeans pass the present life without ignominy, nor deserve the happiness\r\nof the next, if he violated the oath made to paternal affection. In\r\naddition to this, he contemplated the tenor of the papal decree,\r\ncommanding obedience to the oath taken in the presence of his father:\r\na copy of which decree I shall be careful to give in my next book.\r\nRobert, who had imbibed knowledge by a copious draught from the fount\r\nof science, was aware that these things would be of great advantage\r\nto him hereafter. But the king, indignant at the spirit of the earl,\r\ndeprived him, as far as he was able, of all his possessions in England;\r\nand levelled some of his castles to the ground. Bristol alone remained,\r\nwhich not only expelled the enemy, but even harassed the king by\r\nfrequent incursions. But as it may suffice to have brought the first\r\nbook of modern history, from the return of the empress to her father\r\nafter the death of her husband, to this period, I shall now begin the\r\nsecond, from the year in which this heroine came to England, to assert\r\nher right against Stephen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1139, the venom of malice, which had long been nurtured\r\nin the breast of Stephen, at length openly burst forth. Rumours were\r\nprevalent in England, that earl Robert was on the very eve of coming\r\nfrom Normandy with his sister: and, when under such an expectation,\r\nmany persons revolted from the king, not only in inclination but in\r\ndeed, he avenged himself for this injury, at the cost of numbers. He,\r\nalso, contrary to the royal character, seized many at court, through\r\nmere suspicion of hostility to him, and obliged them to surrender\r\ntheir castles, and accede to any conditions he prescribed. There\r\nwere, at that time, two very powerful bishops, in England, Roger of\r\nSalisbury, and his fraternal nephew, Alexander of Lincoln. Alexander\r\nhad built the castle of Newark, as he said, for the defence and dignity\r\nof the bishopric. Roger, who wished to manifest his magnificence\r\nby building, had erected extensive castles at Sherborne, and more\r\nespecially at Devizes. At Malmesbury, even in the church-yard, and\r\nscarcely a stone’s throw from the principal church, he had begun a\r\ncastle. He had gotten into his custody the castle of Salisbury, which\r\nbeing royal property, he had obtained from king Henry, and surrounded\r\nwith a wall. Some powerful laymen, hurt at the probability of being\r\nsurpassed by the clergy, in extent of riches and magnitude of their\r\ntowns, took offence at this, and fostered the latent wound of envy in\r\ntheir bosoms. Wherefore they poured forth their imagined grievances to\r\nthe king; observing, that the bishops, regardless of their order, were\r\nmad for erecting castles: that none could doubt, but that they were\r\ndesigned for the overthrow of the king; for, as soon as the empress\r\nshould arrive, they would, induced doubtless by the recollection of\r\nher father’s kindness to them, immediately greet their sovereign with\r\nthe surrender of their fortresses: that, therefore they ought to be\r\nprevented, and compelled to give up their strong holds; otherwise the\r\nking would repent too late, when he saw in the power of the enemy, that\r\nwhich, had he been wise, he might have applied to his own purpose.\r\nSuch were the frequent insinuations of the nobility. The king, though\r\nfar too partial to them, for some time pretended not to listen to what\r\ngratified his ear so much; assuaging the bitterness of delay, either by\r\nhis respect for the piety of the bishops, or, as I rather think, from\r\napprehension of the odium he might incur, by seizing their castles.\r\nFinally, he only postponed the execution of what the nobles had urged\r\nhim to, till an opportunity presented itself for his purpose: which was\r\nas follows.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1139.] COUNCIL AT OXFORD.]\r\n\r\nA great assembly of the nobles being held at Oxford about the eighth\r\nbefore the kalends of July, the prelates above-mentioned also repaired\r\nthither. The bishop of Salisbury set out on this expedition with great\r\nreluctance; for I heard him speaking to the following purport: “By my\r\nlady St. Mary, I know not why, but my heart revolts at this journey:\r\nthis I am sure of, that I shall be of much the same service at court,\r\nas a foal is in battle:” thus did his mind forbode future evils. Here,\r\nas though fortune would seem subservient to the king’s wishes, a\r\nquarrel arose between the servants of the bishops and those of Alan,\r\nearl of Brittany, about a right to quarters, which had a melancholy\r\ntermination; as the bishop of Salisbury’s retainers, then sitting at\r\ntable, left their meal unfinished and rushed to the contest. At first,\r\nthey contended with reproaches, afterwards with swords. The domestics\r\nof Alan were put to flight, and his nephew nearly killed: nor was the\r\nvictory gained without bloodshed on the bishops’ side; for many were\r\nwounded, and one knight[555] even slain. The king, eagerly seizing the\r\nopportunity, ordered the bishops to be convened by his old instigators,\r\nthat they might make satisfaction to his court, as their people had\r\ninfringed his peace: that this satisfaction should be, the delivery\r\nof the keys of their castles, as pledges of their fidelity. Though\r\nprepared to make compensation, they hesitated at the surrender of their\r\nfortresses; and in consequence, lest they should depart, he ordered\r\nthem into close confinement. He therefore conducted bishop Roger,\r\nunfettered, but the chancellor, the nephew, or as it was reported,\r\nmore than the nephew,[556] of the bishop, in chains, to Devizes; a\r\ncastle, erected at great and almost incalculable expense, not, as the\r\nprelate himself used to say, for the ornament, but as the real fact\r\nis, to the detriment of the church. At the first summons, the castles\r\nof Salisbury, Sherborne, and Malmesbury were yielded to the king.\r\nDevizes also surrendered at the end of three days, after the bishop had\r\nvoluntarily enjoined himself abstinence from all food, that, by his\r\npersonal sufferings, he might subdue the spirit of the bishop of Ely,\r\nwho had taken possession[557] of it. Nor did the bishop of Lincoln act\r\nmore perseveringly; for he purchased his liberty by the surrender of\r\nhis castles of Newark and Sleaford.\r\n\r\nThis transaction of the king’s gave rise to the expression of many\r\ndifferent opinions. Some observed, that the bishops were justly\r\ndispossessed of their castles, as they had built them in opposition\r\nto the injunction of the canons: they ought to be glad preachers\r\nof peace, not builders of houses which might be a refuge for the\r\ncontrivers of evil. Such was the doctrine enforced with ampler reasons\r\nand discourses, by Hugo, archbishop of Rouen: as far as his eloquence\r\nextended, the strenuous champion of the king. Others took the opposite\r\nside of the question. This party was espoused by Henry, bishop of\r\nWinchester, legate of England from the papal see, and brother to\r\nking Stephen, as I have said before, whom no fraternal affection, no\r\nfear of danger, could turn aside from the path of truth. He spake to\r\nthis effect: “If the bishops had in anything overpassed the bounds\r\nof justice, the judging them did not pertain to the king, but to the\r\necclesiastical canons: that they ought not to be deprived of any\r\npossession but by a public and ecclesiastical council: that the king\r\nhad not acted from zealous regard to right, but with a view to his\r\nown advantage; as he had not restored the castles to the churches, at\r\nwhose expense, and on whose land they were built, but had delivered\r\nthem to laymen, and those by no means of religious character.” Though\r\nthe legate made these declarations not only privately, but publicly\r\nalso before the king, and urged him to the liberation and restitution\r\nof the bishops, yet, being entirely disregarded, he lost his labour.\r\nIn consequence, deeming it proper to resort to canonical power, he\r\nsummoned his brother, without delay, to be present at a council he\r\nintended to hold at Winchester, on the fourth before the kalends of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1139.] COUNCIL AT WINCHESTER.]\r\n\r\nOn the appointed day, almost all the bishops of England, with\r\nTheobald, archbishop of Canterbury, who had succeeded William, came to\r\nWinchester. Thurstan, archbishop of York, excused himself, on account\r\nof the malady with which he was afflicted; for he was so enfeebled, as\r\nto be hardly able to guide his steps: the others apologized for their\r\nabsence, by letter, on account of the war. The bull of pope Innocent\r\nwas first read in the council, whereby, even from the kalends of March,\r\nif I rightly remember, he had enjoined the administration of his\r\nanxious charge to the lord bishop of Winchester, as legate in England.\r\nThis was received with much good-will, as the bishop had shown his\r\nforbearance by the lapse of time, and had not proclaimed himself legate\r\nwith precipitate vanity. Next followed, in the council, his address, in\r\nthe Latin tongue, directed to the learned, on the disgraceful detention\r\nof the bishops: “of whom the bishop of Salisbury had been seized in\r\na chamber of the palace, Lincoln in his lodgings, and Ely, fearing\r\na similar treatment, had escaped the calamity by a hasty retreat to\r\nDevizes:” he observed, “that it was a dreadful crime, that the king\r\nshould be so led away by sinister persons, as to have ordered violent\r\nhands to be laid on his subjects, more especially bishops, in the\r\nsecurity of his court: that, to the king’s disgrace was to be added the\r\noffence against God, in despoiling the churches of their possessions,\r\nunder pretext of the criminality of the prelates: that, the king’s\r\noutrage against the law of God, was matter of such pain to him, that he\r\nhad rather himself suffer grievous injury, both in person and property,\r\nthan have the episcopal dignity so basely humiliated; moreover, that\r\nthe king, being repeatedly admonished to amend his fault, had, at\r\nlast, not refused that the council should be summoned: that therefore,\r\nthe archbishop and the rest should deliberate what was proper to be\r\ndone; and he would not be wanting to execute the sentence of the\r\ncouncil, either through regard to the friendship of the king, who was\r\nhis brother, or loss of property, or even danger of life.”\r\n\r\nWhen he had gradually expatiated on these matters, the king, not\r\ndistrusting his cause, sent certain[558]earls into the council to\r\ndemand wherefore he was summoned. The legate briefly replied, “that,\r\nwhen he recollected he was in subjection to the faith of Christ, he\r\nought not to be displeased, if, when guilty of a crime, such as the\r\npresent age had never witnessed, he was required, by the ministers of\r\nChrist, to make satisfaction: that it was the act of heathen nations\r\nto imprison bishops, and divest them of their possessions: that they\r\nshould tell his brother, therefore, that if he would deign a patient\r\nassent to his advice, he would give him such, by the authority of God,\r\nas neither the church of Rome, nor the French king’s court, nor even\r\nearl Theobald, their common brother, a man of surpassing sense and\r\npiety, could reasonably oppose; but such as they ought favourably to\r\nembrace: that, at present, the king would act advisedly, if he would\r\neither account for his conduct, or submit to canonical judgment: it\r\nwas, moreover, a debt he owed, to favour the church, by whose fostering\r\ncare, not by military force, he had been promoted to the kingdom.”\r\nThe earls retiring after this speech, returned shortly with an answer\r\nprepared. They were accompanied by one Alberic de Ver, a man deeply\r\nversed in legal affairs. He related the king’s answer, and aggravated\r\nas much as possible the case of bishop Roger, for bishop Alexander\r\nhad departed; but this he did with moderation, and without using\r\nopprobrious language, though some of the earls, standing by, repeatedly\r\ninterrupted his harangue by casting reproaches on the bishop.\r\n\r\nThe sum of what Alberic had to allege, was as follows: “That bishop\r\nRoger had greatly injured king Stephen; that he seldom came to court,\r\nbut his people, presuming on his power, excited tumults; that they\r\nhad, frequently at other places and very lately at Oxford, attacked\r\nthe attendants, and even the very nephew of earl Alan, as well as\r\nthe servants of Hervey de Lyons, a man of such high nobility, and so\r\nextremely haughty, that he had never deigned to visit England though\r\nking Henry had invited him; that the injury, therefore, of such\r\nviolence having been offered him, doubly recoiled on king Stephen,\r\nthrough respect to whom he had come hither; that the bishop of Lincoln\r\nhad been the author of the tumult excited by his followers from ancient\r\nenmity to Alan; that the bishop of Salisbury secretly favoured the\r\nking’s enemies, though he disguised his subtlety for the moment; that\r\nthe king had discovered this beyond all doubt, from many circumstances,\r\nmore especially, however, from the said bishop’s having refused\r\npermission to Roger de Mortimer with the king’s soldiers whom he was\r\nconducting, when under the greatest apprehensions from the garrison of\r\nBristol, to continue even a single night at Malmesbury; that it was in\r\nevery person’s mouth, that, as soon as the empress should arrive, he\r\nwould join her party, with his nephews and their castles; that Roger,\r\nin consequence, was made captive, not as a bishop but as the king’s\r\nservant who had administered his affairs and received his wages; that\r\nthe king had not taken their castles by violence, but that both bishops\r\nhad surrendered them voluntarily to escape the punishment due to the\r\ndisturbance they had excited in the court; that the king had found\r\nsome trifling sums of money in the castles which must lawfully belong\r\nto himself, as bishop Roger had collected it from the revenues of the\r\nexchequer in the times of his uncle and predecessor king Henry; that\r\nthe bishop had readily relinquished this money as well as the castles\r\nthrough consciousness of his offences, of which the king did not want\r\nfor witnesses; that, therefore, he was willing that the conditions\r\nentered into by himself and the bishops should remain in force.”\r\n\r\nIt was rejoined by bishop Roger, in opposition to the speech of\r\nAlberic, that he had never been the minister of king Stephen; nor had\r\nhe received his wages. This spirited man, too, who blushed at being\r\ncast down by adversity, threatened, that if he could not have justice\r\nfor the property which had been wrested from him, in that council, he\r\nwould seek it in the audience of a higher court. The legate mildly,\r\nas usual, observed that every allegation against the bishops ought to\r\nbe made and the truth of it inquired into in an ecclesiastical court,\r\nbefore passing sentence, contrary to the canons, on innocent persons;\r\nthat the king ought therefore to do as was incumbent in civil courts,\r\nthat is, re-invest the bishops with their own property, otherwise,\r\nbeing disseized, by the law of nations, they will not plead.\r\n\r\nMany arguments of this kind being used on both sides, the cause, at the\r\nking’s request, was adjourned to the next day; then, on the morrow,\r\nprolonged still a day farther till the arrival of the archbishop of\r\nRouen.\r\n\r\nWhen he came, while all were anxious to hear what he had to allege, he\r\nsaid he was willing to allow the bishops their castles if they could\r\nprove by the canons that they ought justly to possess them; but as they\r\nwere not able to do this it was the height of impudence to contend\r\nagainst the canons. “And admitting,” said he, “that it be just for them\r\nto possess castles, yet most assuredly, as the times are eventful, all\r\nchiefs, after the custom of other nations, ought to deliver up the\r\nkeys of their fortifications to the will of the king, who is bound to\r\nwage war for the common security.” Thus the whole plea of the bishops\r\nwas shaken: for, either according to the decrees of the canons, it was\r\nunjust for them to have castles, or, if that were allowed by the king’s\r\nindulgence, they ought to yield to the emergency of the times, and give\r\nup the keys.\r\n\r\nTo this, the aforesaid pleader Alberic added that it had been signified\r\nto the king that the bishops muttered among themselves, and had even\r\nmade preparation for some of their party to proceed to Rome against\r\nhim. “And this,” said he, “the king advises that none of you presume to\r\ndo; for if any person shall go from England to any place, in opposition\r\nto him and to the dignity of his kingdom, perhaps his return may not\r\nbe so easy. Moreover, he, as he sees himself aggrieved, of his own\r\naccord summons you to Rome.” When the king had sent such a message,\r\npartly advising and partly threatening, it was perceived what was his\r\ndesign. In consequence the council broke up, as he would not submit to\r\ncanonical censure; and the bishops deemed it unadvisable to enforce\r\nit against him for two reasons: first, because it was a rash act to\r\nexcommunicate the king without the knowledge of the pope; secondly,\r\nbecause they understood, or some of them even saw, that swords were\r\nunsheathed around them. The contention was no longer of mere words, but\r\nnearly for life and for blood. The legate and the archbishop still,\r\nhowever, were anxiously observant of their duty. They humbly prostrated\r\nthemselves before the king in his chamber, entreating him to take pity\r\non the church, and to consider his soul and his reputation, and that\r\nhe would not suffer a schism to be made between the empire and the\r\npriesthood. Although he in some measure removed the odium of his former\r\nconduct, by condescendingly rising to them, yet, prevented by ill\r\nadvice, he carried none of his fair promises into effect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1139.] ARRIVAL OF EARL ROBERT.]\r\n\r\nThe council broke up on the kalends of September; and on the day\r\nprevious to the kalends of October, earl Robert, having at length\r\nsurmounted every cause of delay, arrived with the empress his sister\r\nin England, relying on the protection of God and the observance of his\r\nlawful oath; but with a much smaller military force than any other\r\nperson would have required for so perilous an enterprise; for he had\r\nnot with him, at that time, more than one hundred and forty horsemen.\r\nMy assertion is supported by persons of veracity; and did it not\r\nlook like flattery, I would say that he was not inferior to Julius\r\nCæsar, at least in resolution, whom Livy[559] relates to have had but\r\nfive cohorts when he began the civil war, with which he attacked the\r\nworld; though the comparison between Julius and Robert is invidious.\r\nFor Julius, an alien to the true faith, reposed his hope on his good\r\nfortune, as he used to say, and the valour of his legions; Robert,\r\ncelebrated for Christian piety, relied only on the assistance of the\r\nHoly Spirit and the lady St. Mary. The former had partizans in Gaul,\r\nin part of Germany, and Brittany, and had attached to him by means of\r\npresents all the Roman people with the exception of the senate; the\r\nlatter, bating a very few who regarded their plighted oath, found the\r\nnobility in England either opposing or affording him no assistance.\r\nHe landed, then, at Arundel, and for a time delivered his sister into\r\nthe safe keeping, as he supposed, of her mother-in-law, whom Henry,\r\nas I have before related, had taken to his bed on the death of the\r\nempress’s mother. Himself proceeded through the hostile country to\r\nBristol, accompanied, as I have heard, by scarcely twelve horsemen,\r\nand was joined in the midst of his journey by Brian Fitz-Count of\r\nWallingford. Nor was it long ere he learned that his sister had\r\nquitted Arundel; for her mother-in-law, through female inconstancy,\r\nhad broken the faith she had repeatedly pledged by messages sent into\r\nNormandy. The earl, therefore, committed the empress to Henry bishop of\r\nWinchester and Waleran earl of Mellent for safe conduct, a favour never\r\ndenied to the most inveterate enemy by honourable soldiers. Waleran,\r\nindeed, declined going farther than Calne, but the bishop continued his\r\nroute. The earl, therefore, quickly collecting his troops, came to the\r\nboundary appointed by the king, and placed his sister in safe quarters\r\nat Bristol. She was afterwards received into Gloucester by Milo, who\r\nheld the castle of that city under the earl in the time of king Henry,\r\ndoing him homage and swearing fidelity to him; for this is the chief\r\ncity of his county.\r\n\r\nOn the nones of October one Robert Fitz-Hubert, a savage barbarian, by\r\nnight clandestinely entering the castle of Malmesbury, which bishop\r\nRochester had inauspiciously founded, and burning the town, boasted\r\nof the deed, as though he had gained a great triumph. But, within a\r\nfortnight, his joy was at an end, being put to flight by the king.\r\nStephen, in the meantime, commanded possession to be kept of the\r\ncastle, until, on the restoration of peace, it might be destroyed.\r\nThe king, moreover, before he came to Malmesbury, had occupied, and\r\nplaced a garrison in a small fortress called Cerney, belonging to\r\nthe aforesaid Milo. In consequence, thinking he should be equally\r\nsuccessful elsewhere, as at that place and at Malmesbury, he assailed\r\na castle called Trowbridge, belonging to Humphrey de Bohun, who was of\r\nthe empress’s party, but he departed without success.\r\n\r\nThe whole country then around Gloucester to the extremity of Wales,\r\npartly by force, and partly by favour, in the course of the remaining\r\nmonths of that year, gradually espoused the party of their sovereign\r\nthe empress. The owners of certain castles, securing themselves within\r\ntheir fastnesses, waited the issue of events. The city of Hereford\r\nwas taken without difficulty; and a few soldiers, who determined on\r\nresistance, had thrown themselves into the castle, were blocked up.\r\nThe king drew nigh, if possible, to devise means for their assistance;\r\nbut frustrated in his wishes, he retired with disgrace. He also\r\napproached Bristol, and going beyond it, burnt the neighbourhood around\r\nDunstore, leaving nothing, as far as he was able, which could minister\r\nfood to his enemies, or advantage to any one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1139.] BISHOP OF SALISBURY’S DEATH.]\r\n\r\nOn the third before the ides of December, Roger bishop of Salisbury,\r\nby the kindness of death, escaped the quartan ague which had long\r\nafflicted him. They assert that his sickness was brought upon him\r\nthrough grief at the severe and repeated injuries he had received from\r\nking Stephen. To me it appears, that God exhibited him to the wealthy\r\nas an example of the mutability of fortune, in order that they should\r\nnot trust in uncertain riches, which, as the apostle says, “while\r\nsome have coveted, concerning faith have made shipwreck.” He first\r\ningratiated himself with prince Henry, who became afterwards king, by\r\nhis prudence in the management of domestic matters, and by restraining\r\nthe excesses of his household. For, before his accession, Henry had\r\nbeen careful and economical in his expenses, compelled thereto by\r\nthe scantiness of his resources, and the illiberal treatment of his\r\nbrothers, William and Robert. Knowing his disposition this way, Roger\r\nhad deserved so well of him in his time of need, that, when he came\r\nto the throne, he denied him scarcely any thing he thought proper to\r\nask; gave him estates, churches, prebends, entire abbeys of monks,\r\nand, lastly, committed even the kingdom to his fidelity: made him\r\nchancellor, in the beginning of his reign, and not long after, bishop\r\nof Salisbury. Roger, therefore decided causes; he regulated the\r\nexpenditure; he had charge of the treasury. Such were his occupations\r\nwhen the king was in England: such, without associate or inspector,\r\nwhen he resided in Normandy; which took place repeatedly, and for a\r\nlong time together. And not only the king, but the nobility, even\r\nthose who were secretly stung with envy at his good fortune, and more\r\nespecially the ministers and debtors of the king, gave him almost\r\nwhatever he could fancy. Was there any thing contiguous to his property\r\nwhich might be advantageous to him, he would directly extort it, either\r\nby entreaty or purchase; or, if that failed, by force. With unrivalled\r\nmagnificence in their construction, as our times may recollect, he\r\nerected splendid mansions on all his estates; in merely maintaining\r\nwhich, the labour of his successors shall toil in vain. His cathedral\r\nhe dignified to the utmost with matchless ornaments and buildings on\r\nwhich no expense was spared. It was truly wonderful to behold in this\r\nman, what abundant power attended him in every kind of dignity, and\r\nflowed as it were to his hand. How great was the glory, indeed, what\r\ncould exceed it, that he should have made his two nephews, by virtue of\r\nhis education, men of noted learning and industry, bishops; and, not\r\nof mean sees; but of Lincoln and Ely, than which, I know not whether\r\nthere be more opulent in England? He was sensible of his power, and,\r\nsomewhat more harshly than became such a character, abused the favours\r\nof heaven. Lastly, as a certain poet observes of a rich man,[560]\r\n\r\n  “He builds, destroys, and changes square for round,”\r\n\r\nso Roger attempted to turn abbeys into bishoprics, and bishoprics into\r\nabbeys. The most ancient monasteries of Malmesbury and Abbotsbury,\r\nhe annexed, as far as he was able, to his see. He changed the priory\r\nof Sherborne, which is subject to the bishop of Salisbury, into an\r\nabbey; and the abbey of Hortun was forthwith dissolved and united to\r\nit. These events took place in the time of king Henry, under whom,\r\nas I have observed, his prosperity reached its zenith: for under\r\nStephen, as I have before related, it began to decline; except that in\r\nthe beginning of his reign, he obtained for one of his nephews, the\r\nchancellorship; for the other the office of treasurer; and for himself\r\nthe town of Malmesbury; the king repeating often to his companions, “By\r\nthe birth of God, I would give him half England, if he asked for it:\r\ntill the time be ripe, he shall tire of asking, ere I tire of giving.”\r\nBut fortune, who, in former times, had flattered him so long and so\r\ntranscendently, at last cruelly pierced him with scorpion-sting. Such\r\nwas that instance, when he saw those whom he dearly regarded, wounded;\r\nand his most favoured knight killed before his face; the next day,\r\nhimself, and, as I said before, his nephews, very powerful bishops, the\r\none compelled to fly, the other detained, and the third, a young man\r\nto whom he was greatly attached, bound with chains: on the surrender\r\nof his castles, his treasures pillaged, and himself afterwards, in the\r\ncouncil, loaded with the most disgraceful reproaches. Finally, as he\r\nwas nearly breathing his latest sigh, at Salisbury, the residue of his\r\nmoney and utensils, which he had placed upon the altar for the purpose\r\nof completing the church, was carried off against his will. The height\r\nof his calamity, was, I think, a circumstance which even I cannot help\r\ncommiserating; that, though he appeared wretched to many, yet there\r\nwere very few who pitied him: so much envy and hatred had his excessive\r\npower drawn on him, and undeservedly, too, from some of those very\r\npersons whom he had advanced to honour.\r\n\r\nIn the year of the Incarnate Word 1140, the monks of those abbeys\r\nwhich Roger had unjustifiably usurped, waiting on the king, were\r\npermitted to enjoy their ancient privileges, and abbats, as formerly.\r\nJohn, a monk of that place, a man highly celebrated for the affability\r\nof his manners and the liberality of his mind, was elected abbat of\r\nMalmesbury by the monks, according to the tenor of the privilege which\r\nSt. Aldhelm had obtained from pope Sergius four hundred and sixty-six\r\nyears before, and had caused to be confirmed by the kings, Ina of the\r\nWest Saxons, and Ethelred of the Mercians. The legate approved the\r\nclaim, but disapproved of the person: for he could not be induced to\r\nbelieve that the king had consented to the election but by a gift in\r\nmoney. And, indeed, a small sum had been promised, on the score of\r\nliberating the church, not for the election of the person. Wherefore\r\nJohn, though taken off by a premature death within the year, still left\r\na lasting and laudable memory of himself to all succeeding ages. For no\r\nmonk of that place, I confess the truth, would have pursued a task of\r\nsuch difficulty, had not John begun it. Wherefore let his successors\r\nbe praised, if they shall preserve the liberty of that church; he\r\ncertainly rescued it from thraldom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1140.] DISTRESSED STATE OF ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe whole of this year was embittered by the horrors of war.\r\nThere were many castles throughout England, each defending their\r\nneighbourhood, but, more properly speaking, laying it waste. The\r\ngarrisons drove off from the fields, both sheep and cattle, nor did\r\nthey abstain either from churches or church-yards. Seizing such of\r\nthe country vavassours[561] as were reputed to be possessed of\r\nmoney, they compelled them, by extreme torture, to promise whatever\r\nthey thought fit. Plundering the houses of the wretched husbandmen,\r\neven to their very beds, they cast them into prison; nor did they\r\nliberate them, but on their giving every thing they possessed or\r\ncould by any means scrape together, for their release. Many calmly\r\nexpired in the midst of torments inflicted to compel them to ransom\r\nthemselves, bewailing, which was all they could do, their miseries to\r\nGod. And, indeed, at the instance of the earl, the legate, with the\r\nbishops, repeatedly excommunicated all violators of church-yards and\r\nplunderers of churches, and those who laid violent hands on men in\r\nholy or monastic orders, or their servants: but this his attention\r\nprofited but little. It was distressing, therefore, to see England,\r\nonce the fondest cherisher of peace and the single receptacle of\r\ntranquillity, reduced to such a pitch of misery, that, not even the\r\nbishops, nor monks, could pass in safety from one town to another.\r\nUnder king Henry, many foreigners, who had been driven from home by the\r\ncommotions of their native land, were accustomed to resort to England,\r\nand rest in quiet under his fostering protection: in Stephen’s time,\r\nnumbers of freebooters from Flanders and Brittany flocked to England,\r\nin expectation of rich pillage. Meanwhile, the earl of Gloucester\r\nconducted himself with caution, and his most earnest endeavours were\r\ndirected to gaining conquests with the smaller loss to his adherents.\r\nSuch of the English nobility as he could not prevail upon to regard\r\nthe obligation of their oath, he held it sufficient if he could so\r\nrestrain, that, if they did not assist, they would not injure the\r\ncause: being willing, according to the saying of the comic writer,\r\n“To do what he could, when he could not do what he would.” But when\r\nhe saw the opportunity present itself, he strenuously performed the\r\nduty both of soldier and of general; more especially, he valiantly\r\nsubdued those strong holds, which were of signal detriment to the\r\ncause he had espoused; that is to say, Harpetrey, which king Stephen\r\nhad taken from certain soldiers of the earl before he came to England,\r\nand many others; Sudley, Cerney, which the king had garrisoned, as\r\nI have said; and the castle which Stephen had fortified over against\r\nWallingford, he levelled to the ground. He also, in these difficult\r\ntimes, created his brother Rainald, earl of Cornwall. Nor indeed did\r\nthe king show less spirit in performing the duties of his station; for\r\nhe omitted no occasion of repeatedly beating off his adversaries, and\r\ndefending his own possessions. But he failed of success, and all things\r\ndeclined, for lack of justice. Dearth of provisions, too, increased by\r\ndegrees, and the scarcity of good money was so great, from its being\r\ncounterfeited, that, sometimes out of ten or more shillings, hardly\r\na dozen pence would be received. The king himself was reported to\r\nhave ordered the weight of the penny, as established in king Henry’s\r\ntime, to be reduced, because, having exhausted the vast treasures of\r\nhis predecessor, he was unable to provide for the expense of so many\r\nsoldiers. All things, then, became venal in England; and churches and\r\nabbeys were no longer secretly, but even publicly exposed to sale.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1140.] ROBERT FITZ-HUBERT.]\r\n\r\nDuring this year, in Lent, on the thirteenth before the kalends of\r\nApril, at the ninth hour of the fourth day of the week, there was an\r\neclipse, throughout England, as I have heard. With us, indeed, and\r\nwith all our neighbours, the obscuration of the sun was so remarkable,\r\nthat persons sitting at table, as it then happened almost every where,\r\nfor it was Lent, at first feared that chaos was come again: afterwards\r\nlearning its cause, they went out, and beheld the stars around the sun.\r\nIt was thought and said by many, not untruly, that the king would not\r\ncontinue a year in the government.\r\n\r\nIn the following week, that is, during the time of the Passion, on\r\nthe seventh before the kalends of April, the forementioned barbarian,\r\nRobert Fitz-Hubert, a character well calculated for the stratagems\r\nof war, surprised the castle of Devizes:[562] a man, by far the most\r\ncruel of any within the circle of this age’s memory: blasphemous,\r\nalso, towards God. He used voluntarily to boast of having been\r\npresent at a place where twenty-four monks were burnt, together with\r\nthe church, declaring, that he too would frequently do the like in\r\nEngland, and grieve God, by the plunder of the church of Wilton; and\r\nthe destruction of Malmesbury, with the slaughter of all its monks:\r\nthat he would return them this good office, because they had admitted\r\nthe king, to his disadvantage: for of this he accused them, though\r\nwithout foundation. I myself have heard, when, at any time, which was\r\nextremely rare indeed, he liberated his captives without torture,\r\nand they thanked him for it, on the part of God, I have heard him, I\r\nsay, reply; “never let God owe me any thanks.” He used to expose his\r\nprisoners, naked and rubbed with honey, to the burning heat of the sun;\r\nthereby exciting flies, and other insects of that kind, to sting them.\r\nBut, having now got possession of Devizes, he hesitated not to boast,\r\nthat, he should gain, by means of this castle, the whole district from\r\nWinchester to London; and that he would send to Flanders for soldiers\r\nto defend him. While meditating, however, such a scheme, divine\r\nvengeance overtook him through the agency of one John Fitz-Gilbert, a\r\nman of surprising subtlety, who had a castle at Marlborough. For being\r\nthrown into chains by him, because he refused to surrender Devizes\r\nto his sovereign, the empress, he was hanged, like a common thief.\r\nWonderful was the judgment of God on this sacrilegious wretch, that he\r\nshould meet with such an ignominious end, not from the king, to whom\r\nhe was inimical, but from the very persons he appeared to favour. The\r\nauthors of his death ought worthily to be extolled, for having freed\r\nthe country from such a pest, and justly despatched an intestine enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, during Pentecost, the king resided at London, in the\r\nTower, attended only by the bishop of Sees, for the others disdained,\r\nor feared, to come thither. Some little time after, by the mediation\r\nof the legate, a conference was appointed between the empress and the\r\nking, that, if possible, by the inspiration of God, peace might be\r\nrestored. To this conference, near Bath, were sent on the part of the\r\nempress, her brother Robert, and others of her friends: on the king’s,\r\nthe legate, the archbishop, and also the queen. But they wasted words\r\nand time, to no purpose, and departed without being able to conclude\r\na peace. Nor was the ground of separation equal on both sides, as the\r\nempress, more inclined to justice, had declared, that she was not\r\naverse to the decision of the church: but the king most cautiously\r\navoided this; fondly trusting to the counsels of those persons who\r\nloved nothing less than peace, so long as they could make their\r\nascendency over him answer their own purposes. In the latter end of\r\nSeptember, the legate, who knew that it was the especial duty of his\r\noffice to restore peace, undertaking the toil of a foreign voyage for\r\nits accomplishment, hastened to sail over to France. Here, a long and\r\nanxious discussion, for tranquillizing England, taking place, between\r\nthe king of France, earl Theobald, and many of the clergy, he returned,\r\nnearly at the end of November, bringing back counsels wholesome for\r\nthe country, could they have been carried into effect. And indeed the\r\nempress and the earl assented to them immediately, but the king delayed\r\nfrom day to day, and finally rejected them altogether. Upon this, at\r\nlast, the legate discontinued his exertions, waiting, like the rest,\r\nfor the issue of events: for what avails it to swim against the stream?\r\nand, as some one observes, “To seek odium only by one’s labours is the\r\nheight of madness.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now attempt to give a clue to the mazy labyrinth of events and\r\ntransactions which occurred in England, during the year 1141,[563] lest\r\nposterity, through my neglect, should be unacquainted with them; as\r\nit is of service to know the volubility of fortune and the mutability\r\nof human estate, God only permitting or ordaining them. And, as the\r\nmoderns greatly and deservedly blame our predecessors, for having left\r\nno memorial of themselves or their transactions since the days of Bede,\r\nI think I ought to be very favourably regarded by my readers, if they\r\njudge rightly, for determining to remove this reproach from our times.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1141.] SIEGE OF LINCOLN.]\r\n\r\nKing Stephen had peaceably departed from the county of Lincoln before\r\nChristmas, and had augmented the honours of the earl of Chester,[564]\r\nand of his brother; of whom the earl, long since, in the time of king\r\nHenry, had been married to the daughter of the earl of Gloucester. In\r\nthe meanwhile, the citizens of Lincoln, who wished to acquire great\r\nfavour with the king, certified him by a message, when resident in\r\nLondon, that the two brothers had taken up their abode in security,\r\nin the castle of that city: and that, suspecting nothing less than\r\nthe arrival of the king, they might be very easily surprised, while\r\nthemselves would provide that he should get possession of the castle\r\nas secretly as possible. As Stephen never wished to neglect any\r\nopportunity of augmenting his power, he gladly repaired thither. In\r\nconsequence, the brothers were surprised and besieged, even in the\r\nChristmas holidays. This step appeared unjustifiable to many, because,\r\nas I have observed, he had left them before the festival, without\r\nany suspicion of enmity; nor had he, even now, after ancient usage,\r\nabjured his friendship with them, which they call “defying.” However,\r\nthe earl of Chester, though surrounded with imminent dangers, adroitly\r\nescaped from the castle. By what management this was accomplished I\r\nknow not; whether through consent of some of the besiegers, or whether,\r\nbecause valour, when taken by surprise, frequently tries variety\r\nof methods, and often discovers a remedy for its emergencies. Not\r\ncontent with his own escape, he earnestly cast about, how to devise\r\nthe safety of his brother and of his wife, whom he had left in the\r\nfortress. The more prudent mode seemed to be, to request assistance\r\nfrom his father-in-law, although he had long since offended him on\r\nmany accounts, but principally because he appeared staunch to neither\r\nparty. He sent messengers, therefore, promising eternal fidelity to the\r\nempress, if, induced more by affectionate regard than any desert of\r\nhis, he would rescue those from danger, who were already in the very\r\njaws of captivity.\r\n\r\nUnable to endure this indignity, the earl of Gloucester readily\r\nassented. Weary of delay, too, as the fairest country was harassed\r\nwith intestine rapine and slaughter, for the sake of two persons, he\r\npreferred bringing the matter to an issue at once, would God permit.\r\nHe hoped, also, for the Divine assistance on his undertaking, as the\r\nking had molested his son-in-law, without any fault on his part; was at\r\nthat moment besieging his daughter; and had castellated the church of\r\nthe holy mother of God in Lincoln. How much ought these things to weigh\r\nin the mind of a prince? Would it not be better to die, and fall with\r\nhonour, than endure so marked a disgrace? For the sake then of avenging\r\nGod, and his sister, and liberating his relations, he entered on this\r\nperilous undertaking. The supporters of his party readily accompanied\r\nhim; the major part of whom being deprived of their inheritances, were\r\ninstigated to hostility by rage at their losses, and the consciousness\r\nof their valour. However, during the whole extended march, from\r\nGloucester to Lincoln, he studiously concealed his intention, leaving\r\nall the army, with the exception of a very few, in suspense, by his\r\nmysterious conduct.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1141.] STEPHEN DEFEATED.]\r\n\r\nAt length, on the day of the Purification of the blessed Mary, they\r\narrived at the river flowing between the two armies, called the\r\nTrent, which, from its springs, together with floods of rain, had\r\nrisen so high, that it could not possibly be forded. Here, at last,\r\ndisclosing his intention to his son-in-law, who had joined him with a\r\nstrong force, and to those he had brought with him, he added, that,\r\n“He had long since made up his mind, never to be induced to fly, be\r\nthe emergency what it might; if they could not conquer, they must die\r\nor be taken.” All encouraged him to hope the best; and, wonderful to\r\nhear, though on the eve of hazarding a battle, he swam over the rapid\r\nriver I have mentioned, with the whole of his party. So great was the\r\nearl’s ardour to put an end to calamity, that he preferred risking\r\nextremities to prolonging the sufferings of the country. The king,\r\ntoo, with many earls, and an active body of cavalry, abandoning the\r\nsiege, courageously presented himself for battle. The royalists began\r\nthe prelude to the fight, which they call the “joust,”[565] as they\r\nwere skilled in that exercise: but when they saw that the consular\r\nparty, if they may be so called, did not attack from a distance with\r\nlances, but at close quarters with swords, and broke the king’s ranks\r\nwith violent and determined onset, the earls, to a man, for six of\r\nthem had entered the conflict, together with the king, consulted their\r\nsafety by flight. A few barons, of laudable fidelity and valour, who\r\nwould not desert him, even in his necessity, were made captive. The\r\nking, though he by no means wanted spirit to defend himself, being\r\nat last attacked on every side by the earl of Gloucester’s soldiers,\r\nfell to the ground by a blow from a stone; but who was the author of\r\nthis deed is uncertain. Thus, when all around him were either taken\r\nor dispersed, he was compelled to yield to circumstances and become a\r\ncaptive. On which the truly noble earl of Gloucester commanded the king\r\nto be preserved uninjured, not suffering him to be molested even with\r\na reproach; and the person, whom he had just before fiercely attacked\r\nwhen dignified with the sovereignty, he now calmly protected when\r\nsubdued: that the tumults of anger and of joy being quieted, he might\r\nshow kindness to his relation, and respect the dignity of the diadem\r\nin the captive. The citizens of Lincoln were slaughtered on all sides\r\nby the just indignation of the victors, and without commiseration on\r\nthe part of the conquered, as they had been the origin and fomenters of\r\nthis calamity.\r\n\r\nThe king, according to the custom of such as are called captives,\r\nwas presented to the empress, at Gloucester, by her brother, and\r\nafterwards conducted to Bristol. Here, at first, he was kept with\r\nevery mark of honour, except the liberty of going at large: but in\r\nsucceeding time, through the presumption of certain persons, who said\r\nopenly and contumeliously, that it did not behove the earl to treat\r\nthe king otherwise than they chose; and also, because it was reported,\r\nthat having either eluded or bribed his keepers, he had been found,\r\nmore than once, beyond the appointed limits, more especially in the\r\nnight-time, he was confined with fetters.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, both the empress and the earl dealt by messengers\r\nwith the legate his brother, that he should forthwith receive her into\r\nthe church,[566] and to the kingdom, as the daughter of king Henry,\r\nto whom all England and Normandy had sworn allegiance. This year, the\r\nfirst Sunday in Lent happened on the fourteenth before the kalends of\r\nMarch. By means of negotiators on either side, the business was so far\r\nforwarded, that they agreed to meet in conference, on an open plain\r\non this side of Winchester. They assembled, therefore, on the third\r\nSunday in Lent, a day dark and rainy, as though the fates would portend\r\na woeful change in this affair. The empress swore, and pledged her\r\nfaith to the bishop, that all matters of importance in England, and\r\nespecially the bestowing of bishoprics and abbeys, should await his\r\ndecision, if he, with the holy church, would receive her as sovereign,\r\nand observe perpetual fidelity towards her. Her brother, Robert, earl\r\nof Gloucester, swore as she did, and pledged his faith for her, as did\r\nalso Brian Fitz-count, lord Marcher[567] of Wallingford, and Milo of\r\nGloucester, afterwards earl of Hereford, with some others. Nor did the\r\nbishop hesitate to receive the empress as sovereign of England, and,\r\ntogether with certain of his party, to pledge his faith, that so long\r\nas she did not infringe the covenant, he would observe his fidelity\r\nto her. On the morrow, which was the fifth before the nones of March,\r\na splendid procession being formed, she was received in the cathedral\r\nof Winchester; the bishop-legate conducting her on the right side,\r\nand Bernard, bishop of St. David’s, on the left. There were present\r\nalso, Alexander, bishop of Lincoln, Robert of Hereford, Nigel of Ely,\r\nRobert of Bath: the abbats, Ingulf of Abingdon, Edward of Reading,\r\nPeter of Malmesbury, Gilbert of Gloucester, Roger of Tewkesbury, and\r\nsome others. In a few days, Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury, came\r\nto the empress at Winchester, by invitation of the legate: but he\r\ndeferred promising fidelity to her, deeming it beneath his reputation\r\nand character to change sides, till he had consulted the king. In\r\nconsequence, he, and many other prelates, with some few of the laity,\r\nwere allowed to visit Stephen and converse with him: and, graciously\r\nobtaining leave to submit to the exigency of the times, they embraced\r\nthe sentiments of the legate. The empress passed Easter, which happened\r\non the third before the kalends of April, at Oxford; the rest returned\r\nto their respective homes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1141.] CONFERENCE AT WINCHESTER.]\r\n\r\nOn the day after the octaves of Easter, a council began, with\r\ngreat parade, at Winchester, consisting of Theobald, archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, all the bishops of England, and many abbats: the legate\r\npresiding. Such as were absent, accounted for it by messengers and\r\nletters. As I was present at the holding of this council, I will\r\nnot deny posterity the truth of every circumstance; for I perfectly\r\nremember it. On the same day, after the letters were read by which\r\nsome excused their absence, the legate called the bishops apart,\r\nand discoursed with them in secret of his design; then the abbats,\r\nand, lastly, the archdeacons were summoned. Of his intention nothing\r\ntranspired publicly, though what was to be done engrossed the minds and\r\nconversation of all.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of the week, the speech of the legate ran nearly to\r\nthis effect: “That, by the condescension of the pope, he acted as his\r\nvicegerent in England: wherefore, by his authority, the clergy of\r\nEngland were assembled at this council to deliberate on the peace of\r\nthe country, which was exposed to imminent danger: that, in the time of\r\nking Henry, his uncle, England had been the peculiar abode of peace;\r\nso that by the activity, and spirit, and care of that most excellent\r\nman, not only the natives, of whatever power or dignity, dared make no\r\ndisturbance; but, by his example, each neighbouring king and prince,\r\nalso, yielded to peace, and either invited, or compelled, his subjects\r\nto do the like: moreover, that this king, some years before his\r\ndeath, had caused the whole realm of England, as well as the duchy of\r\nNormandy, to be engaged, by the oaths of all the bishops and barons, to\r\nhis daughter, late the empress, who was his only surviving issue by his\r\nformer consort, if he should fail of male offspring by the wife he had\r\nespoused from Lorraine: and adverse fortune,” said he, “was envious of\r\nmy most excellent uncle, and suffered him to die in Normandy without\r\nmale issue. Therefore, as it seemed long to wait for a sovereign who\r\ndelayed coming to England, for she resided in Normandy, we provided\r\nfor the peace of the country, and my brother was allowed to reign. And\r\nalthough I gave myself as surety between him and God, that he would\r\nhonour and advance the holy church, and uphold good, but abrogate evil,\r\nlaws; yet it grieves me to remember, shames me to say, how he conducted\r\nhimself in the kingdom: how justice ceased to be exerted against the\r\ndaring; how all peace was annihilated, almost within the year: the\r\nbishops made captive, and compelled to give up their possessions; the\r\nabbeys sold; the churches robbed of their treasures; the counsels of\r\nthe abandoned regarded: while those of the virtuous were postponed or\r\ntotally despised. You know how often I addressed him, both by myself\r\nand the bishops, more especially in the council held last year for\r\nthat purpose, and that I gained by it nothing but odium. Every one,\r\nwho shall think rightly, must be aware, that I ought to love my mortal\r\nbrother, but that I should still more regard the cause of my immortal\r\nFather. Wherefore, since God has exercised his judgment on my brother,\r\nby permitting him, without my knowledge, to fall into the hands of\r\nthe powerful, I have invited you all here to assemble by virtue of\r\nmy legation, lest the kingdom should fall to decay through want of a\r\nsovereign. The case was yesterday agitated in private, before the major\r\npart of the English clergy, to whose right it principally pertains to\r\nelect the sovereign, and also to crown him. First, then, as is fitting,\r\ninvoking God’s assistance, we elect the daughter of that peaceful, that\r\nglorious, that rich, that good, and, in our times, incomparable king,\r\nas sovereign of England and Normandy, and promise her fidelity and\r\nsupport.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1141.] MATILDA ELECTED SOVEREIGN.]\r\n\r\nWhen all present had either becomingly applauded his sentiments, or,\r\nby their silence, not contradicted them, he added: “We have despatched\r\nmessengers for the Londoners, who, from the importance of their city in\r\nEngland, are almost nobles, as it were, to meet us on this business;\r\nand have sent them a safe-conduct: and we trust they will not delay\r\ntheir arrival beyond to-morrow: wherefore let us give them indulgence\r\ntill that time.”\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day of the week the Londoners came; and being introduced\r\nto the council, urged their cause, so far as to say, that they were\r\nsent from the fraternity, as they call it, of London, not to contend,\r\nbut to entreat that their lord the king might be liberated from\r\ncaptivity: that all the barons, who had long since been admitted to\r\ntheir fellowship, most earnestly solicited this of the lord legate and\r\nthe archbishop, as well as of all the clergy who were present. The\r\nlegate answered them copiously and clearly: and, that their request\r\nmight be the less complied with, the speech of the preceding day was\r\nrepeated, with the addition, that it did not become the Londoners, who\r\nwere considered as the chief people of England, in the light of nobles,\r\nto side with those persons who had deserted their lord in battle; by\r\nwhose advice the king had dishonoured the holy church; and who, in\r\nfact, only appeared to favour the Londoners, that they might drain them\r\nof their money.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, a certain person, whose name, if I rightly remember,\r\nwas Christian, a clerk belonging to the queen, as I heard, rose up,\r\nand held forth a paper to the legate. He having silently perused it,\r\nexalted his voice to the highest pitch, and said, that it was informal,\r\nand improper to be recited in so great an assembly, especially of\r\ndignified and religious persons. For, among other offensive and\r\nsingular points, the signature of a person was affixed to it, who, in\r\nthe preceding year, at a similar council, had attacked the venerable\r\nbishops with opprobrious language. The legate thus baffling him, the\r\nclerk was not wanting to his mission, but, with notable confidence,\r\nread the letter in their hearing; of which this was the purport. “The\r\nqueen earnestly entreated the whole clergy assembled, and especially\r\nthe bishop of Winchester, the brother of her lord, to restore the\r\nsaid lord to his kingdom, whom abandoned persons, and even such as\r\nwere under homage to him, had cast into chains.” To this suggestion,\r\nthe legate answered to the same effect as to the Londoners. These\r\nconferring together, declared, that they would relate the decree of the\r\ncouncil to their townsmen, and give it their support as far as they\r\nwere able.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day of the week the council broke up, many of the royal\r\nparty having been first excommunicated; more especially William\r\nMartel, who had formerly been cup-bearer to king Henry, and was\r\nat that time butler to Stephen; for he had sorely exasperated the\r\nlegate, by intercepting and pilfering much of his property. It was\r\nnow a work of great difficulty to soothe the minds of the Londoners:\r\nfor though these matters, as I have said, were agitated immediately\r\nafter Easter, yet was it only a few days before the Nativity of St.\r\nJohn that they would receive the empress. At that time great part\r\nof England readily submitted to her government; her brother Robert\r\nwas assiduously employed in promoting her dignity by every becoming\r\nmethod; kindly addressing the nobility, making many promises, and\r\nintimidating the adverse party, or even, by messengers, exhorting them\r\nto peace; and already restoring justice, and the law of the land, and\r\ntranquillity, throughout every district which favoured the empress;\r\nand it is sufficiently notorious that if his party had trusted to\r\nRobert’s moderation and wisdom, it would not afterwards experienced\r\nso melancholy a reverse. The lord legate, too, appeared of laudable\r\nfidelity in furthering the interests of the empress. But, behold, at\r\nthe very moment when she imagined she should get possession of all\r\nEngland, every thing was changed. The Londoners, ever suspicious and\r\nmurmuring among themselves, now burst out into open expressions of\r\nhatred; and, as it is reported, even laid wait for their sovereign and\r\nher nobles. Aware of and escaping this plot, they gradually retired\r\nfrom the city, without tumult and in a certain military order. The\r\nempress was accompanied by the legate and David king of Scotland, the\r\nheroine’s uncle, together with her brother Robert who then, as at every\r\nother time, shared her fortune; and, in short, all her partizans to a\r\nman escaped in safety. The Londoners, learning their departure, flew to\r\ntheir residence and plundered every thing which they had left in their\r\nhaste.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1141.] THE EMPRESS AND THE LEGATE.]\r\n\r\nNot many days after, a misunderstanding arose between the legate and\r\nthe empress which may be justly considered as the melancholy cause of\r\nevery subsequent evil in England. How this happened I will explain.\r\nKing Stephen had a son named Eustace, begotten on the daughter of\r\nEustace earl of Boulogne. For king Henry, the father of the empress,\r\nthat I may go back somewhat to acquaint posterity with the truth of\r\nthese transactions, had given Mary, the sister of his wife, the mother\r\nof this lady, in marriage to the aforesaid earl, as he was of noble\r\ndescent and equally renowned for prudence and for valour. By Mary,\r\nEustace had no issue except a daughter called Matilda. When she became\r\nmarriageable, after the death of her father, the same truly magnificent\r\nking gave her in wedlock to his nephew Stephen, and also procured by\r\nhis care the county of Boulogne for him, as he had before conferred\r\non him that of Moreton in Normandy. The legate had justly proposed\r\nthat these counties should be bestowed on his nephew Eustace, whom I\r\nmentioned, so long as his father should remain in captivity. This the\r\nempress altogether opposed, and it is doubtful whether she had not even\r\npromised them to others. Offended at the repulse, he kept from her\r\ncourt many days; and though repeatedly sent for, persisted in refusing\r\nto go thither. In the meanwhile, he held a friendly conference with the\r\nqueen, his brother’s wife, at Guildford, and being wrought upon by her\r\ntears and concessions, bent his mind to the liberation of Stephen. He\r\nalso absolved, without consulting the bishops, all those of the king’s\r\nparty whom he had excommunicated in the council, while his complaints\r\nagainst the empress were disseminated through England, that she wished\r\nto seize his person; that she observed nothing which she had sworn to\r\nhim; that all the barons of England had performed their engagements\r\ntowards her, but that she had violated hers, as she knew not how to use\r\nher prosperity with moderation.\r\n\r\nTo allay, if possible, these commotions, the earl of Gloucester, with\r\na retinue not very numerous, proceeded to Winchester; but, failing in\r\nhis endeavours, he returned to Oxford, where his sister had for some\r\ntime established her residence. She therefore understanding, as well\r\nfrom what she was continually hearing, as from what she then learned\r\nfrom her brother, that the legate had no friendly dispositions towards\r\nher, proceeded to Winchester with such forces as she could muster.\r\nBeing immediately admitted into the royal castle, with good intentions\r\nprobably she sent messengers to the bishop, requesting that, as she was\r\nupon the spot, he would come to her without delay. He, not thinking\r\nit safe to go, deceived the messengers by an evasive manner, merely\r\nsaying, “I will prepare myself:” and immediately he sent for all such\r\nas he knew were well-disposed to the king. In consequence almost all\r\nthe earls of England came; for they were full of youth and levity, and\r\npreferred military enterprise to peace. Besides, many of them were\r\nashamed at having deserted the king in battle, as has been said before,\r\nand thought to wipe off the ignominy of having fled, by attending this\r\nmeeting. Few, however, attended the empress: there were David king of\r\nScotland, Robert earl of Gloucester, Milo de Hereford, and some barons;\r\nfor Ranulf earl of Chester came late, and to no purpose. To comprise,\r\ntherefore, a long series of events within narrow limits: the roads on\r\nevery side of Winchester were watched by the queen and the earls who\r\nhad come with her, lest supplies should be brought in to those who had\r\nsworn fidelity to the empress. The town of Andover also was burned.\r\nOn the west, therefore, necessaries were procured but scantily and\r\nwith difficulty; some persons found on the road, being intercepted\r\nand either killed or maimed; while on the east, every avenue towards\r\nLondon was crowded with supplies destined for the bishop and his\r\nparty; Geoffrey de Mandeville, who had now again revolted to them, for\r\nformerly after the capture of the king he had sworn fidelity to the\r\nempress, and the Londoners, lending every possible assistance, and\r\nomitting no circumstance which might distress that princess. The people\r\nof Winchester were, though secretly, inclined to her side, regarding\r\nthe faith they had before pledged to her, although they had been in\r\nsome degree compelled by the bishop to such a measure. In the meanwhile\r\ncombustibles were hurled from the bishop’s castle on the houses of\r\nthe townspeople, who, as I have said, rather wished success to the\r\nempress than to the bishop, which caught and burned the whole abbey of\r\nnuns within the city, and the monastery which is called Hyde without\r\nthe walls. Here was an image of our Lord crucified, wrought with a\r\nprofusion of gold and silver and precious stones, through the pious\r\nsolicitude of Canute, who was formerly king and presented it. This\r\nbeing seized by the flames and thrown to the ground, was afterwards\r\nstripped of its ornaments at the command of the legate himself: more\r\nthan five hundred marks of silver and thirty of gold, which were\r\nfound on it, served for a largess to the soldiers. The abbey of nuns\r\nat Warewell was also burned by one William de Ipres, an abandoned\r\ncharacter who feared neither God nor man, because some of the partizans\r\nof the empress had secured themselves within it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1141.] RETREAT OF THE EARL OF GLOUCESTER.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the earl of Gloucester, though suffering, with\r\nhis followers, by daily contests with the royalists, and though\r\ncircumstances turned out far beneath his expectation, yet ever\r\nabstained from the burning of churches, notwithstanding he resided in\r\nthe vicinity of St. Swithun’s. But unable to endure any longer the\r\ndisgrace of being, together with his party, almost besieged, and seeing\r\nfortune inclining towards the enemy, he deemed it expedient to yield\r\nto necessity; and, having marshalled his troops, he prepared to depart.\r\nSending his sister, therefore, and the rest, in the vanguard, that she\r\nmight proceed without interruption, he himself retreated gently, with\r\na chosen few, who had spirit enough not to be alarmed at a multitude.\r\nThe earls immediately pursuing him, as he thought it disgraceful, and\r\nbeneath his dignity to fly, and was the chief object of universal\r\nattack, he was made captive. The rest, especially the chiefs, proceeded\r\non their destined journey, and, with the utmost precipitation,\r\nreached Devizes. Thus they departed from Winchester on the day of the\r\nexaltation of the holy cross, which at that time happened on a Sunday,\r\nhaving come thither a few days before the assumption of the holy\r\nmother of God. It appeared to some rather miraculous, and was matter\r\nof general conversation in England, that the king on the Sunday of the\r\npurification of our lady, and the earl on the Sunday of the exaltation\r\nof the life-imparting cross, should each experience a similar fate.\r\nThis, however, was truly worthy of remark and admiration, that, no one,\r\non this mischance, ever beheld the earl of Gloucester either dispirited\r\nor dejected in countenance. He breathed too high a consciousness of\r\ndignity, to subject himself to the caprice of fortune; and, although\r\nhe was at first invited by soothing measures, and afterwards assailed\r\nby threats, he never consented to treat of his liberation, except with\r\nthe privity of his sister. At last the affair was thus decided: that\r\nthe king and himself should be liberated on equal terms; no condition\r\nbeing proposed, except that each might defend his party, to the utmost\r\nof his abilities, as before. These matters, after repeated and long\r\ndiscussion, from the exaltation of the holy cross, to the festival of\r\nAll Saints, then came to a suitable conclusion. For on that day, the\r\nking, released from his captivity, left his queen, and son, and two of\r\nthe nobility at Bristol, as sureties for the liberation of the earl;\r\nand came with the utmost speed to Winchester, where the earl, now\r\nbrought from Rochester, whither he had first been taken, was at this\r\ntime confined. The third day after, when the king came to Winchester,\r\nthe earl departed, leaving there on that day his son William, as a\r\npledge, till the queen should be released. Performing with quick\r\ndespatch the journey to Bristol, he liberated the queen, on whose\r\nreturn, William, the earl’s son, was set free from his detention.\r\nIt is, moreover, sufficiently notorious, that, although, during the\r\nwhole of his captivity and of the following months till Christmas,\r\nhe was enticed by numberless and magnificent promises to revolt from\r\nhis sister; yet he always deemed his fraternal affection of greater\r\nimportance than any promise which could be made him. For leaving his\r\nproperty and his castles, which he might have quietly enjoyed, he\r\ncontinued unceasingly near the empress at Oxford, where, as I have said\r\nbefore, fixing her residence, she held her court.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1141.] COUNCIL AT WESTMINSTER.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the legate, a prelate of unbounded spirit, who was\r\nnever inclined to leave incomplete what he had once purposed, summoned\r\nby his legatine authority a council at Westminster, on the octaves of\r\nSt. Andrew. I cannot relate the transactions of this council with that\r\nexact veracity with which I did the former, as I was not present. We\r\nhave heard that a letter was then read from the sovereign pope, in\r\nwhich he gently rebuked the legate for not endeavouring to release\r\nhis brother; but that he forgave him his former transgression, and\r\nearnestly exhorted him to attempt his liberation by any mode, whether\r\necclesiastical or secular: that the king himself entered the council,\r\nand complained to the reverend assembly, that his own subjects had both\r\nmade captive, and nearly killed him by the injuries they inflicted on\r\nhim, who had never refused them justice. That the legate himself, too,\r\nby great powers of eloquence, endeavoured to extenuate the odium of\r\nhis own conduct: that, in truth, he had received the empress, not from\r\ninclination, but necessity; for, that, while his brother’s overthrow\r\nwas yet recent, all the earls being either dispersed or waiting the\r\nissue of events in suspense, she had surrounded Winchester with her\r\nparty: that she had obstinately persevered in breaking every promise\r\nshe had made pertaining to the right of the churches: and that he had\r\nit from unquestionable authority, that she, and her partisans, had not\r\nonly had designs on his dignity, but even on his life: that, however,\r\nGod, in his mercy, had caused matters to fall out contrary to her\r\nhopes, so that he should himself escape destruction, and rescue his\r\nbrother from captivity: that he commanded therefore, on the part of\r\nGod and of the pope, that they should strenuously assist the king,\r\nanointed by the will of the people and with the approbation of the holy\r\nsee: but that such as disturbed the peace, in favour of the countess of\r\nAnjou, should be excommunicated, with the exception of herself, who was\r\nsovereign of the Angevins.\r\n\r\nI do not say, that this speech was kindly received by all the clergy,\r\nthough certainly no one opposed it; for all bridled their tongues\r\neither through fear, or through reverence. There was one layman sent\r\nfrom the empress, who openly forbade the legate, by the faith which he\r\nhad pledged to her, to ordain any thing, in that council, repugnant\r\nto her honour; and said, that he had made oath to the empress, not\r\nto assist his brother, unless, perchance, by sending him twenty\r\nhorsemen at the utmost: that her coming to England had been effected\r\nby his frequent letters: that her taking the king, and holding him in\r\ncaptivity, had been done principally by his connivance. The advocate\r\naffirmed these and many other circumstances, with great harshness of\r\nlanguage, and by no means sparing the legate. However, he could not be\r\nprevailed upon, by any force of argument, to lay aside his animosity:\r\nfor, as I have said before, he was an active perseverer in what he had\r\nonce taken in hand. This year, therefore, the tragedy of which I have\r\nbriefly related, was fatal, and nearly destructive, to England; during\r\nwhich, though conceiving that she might now, perhaps, experience some\r\nlittle respite, yet, she became again involved in calamity, and, unless\r\nGod’s mercy shall shortly come to her relief, must there long continue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1142.] ROBERT, EARL OF GLOUCESTER.]\r\n\r\nIt seems fitting that I should commence the transactions of this year,\r\nwhich is A.D. 1142, with certain events which were unnoticed in the\r\nformer; and, at the same time, briefly recapitulate what has been said,\r\nin various places, of Robert, earl of Gloucester, son of king Henry,\r\nand submit it, thus arranged, to the consideration of the reader. For,\r\nas he was the first to espouse the just defence of his sister, so did\r\nhe persevere with unshaken constancy in her cause without remuneration;\r\nI say without remuneration, because some of her supporters, either\r\nfollowing the course of fortune, are changed with its revolutions, or\r\nhaving already obtained considerable benefits, fight for justice under\r\nexpectation of still further recompence: Robert, alone, or nearly\r\nalone, uninfluenced by such considerations, was never swayed, as will\r\nappear hereafter, either by hope of advantage, or fear of loss. Let\r\nno one, therefore, suspect me of adulation, if I relate these matters\r\ncircumstantially: for I shall make no sacrifice to favour; but pure\r\nhistorical truth, without any stain of falsehood, shall be handed down\r\nto the knowledge of posterity.\r\n\r\nIt has been related of the earl, how, first[568] of all the nobility,\r\nafter David, king of Scotland, he confirmed, by oath, his fealty to\r\nhis sister, the empress, for the kingdom of England, and the duchy\r\nof Normandy, in the presence of his father Henry. There was some\r\ncontention, as I have said, between him and Stephen earl of Boulogne,\r\nafterwards king of England, who should swear first; Robert alleging the\r\npreference of a son, Stephen the dignity of a nephew.\r\n\r\nIt has been recorded too, what reasonable causes, from December,\r\nwhen his father died, till after the ensuing Easter, detained him in\r\nNormandy, from coming immediately into England to avenge his sister’s\r\ninjuries. And when at last he did come, with what just deliberation,\r\nand with what proviso, he consented to do homage to the king; and how\r\njustly, in the following year, and thenceforward, he abjured it.\r\n\r\nNor has his second arrival in England from Normandy, after his father’s\r\ndeath, with his sister, been omitted: where, relying on the favour of\r\nGod, and his innate courage, he ventured himself, as into a desert full\r\nof wild beasts, though scarcely accompanied by one hundred and forty\r\nhorsemen. Neither has it been unnoticed, that, amid such tumult of war,\r\nwhile anxious watch was kept on all sides, he boldly came to Bristol\r\nwith only twelve horsemen, having committed his sister to safe custody,\r\nas he supposed, at Arundel: nor with what prudence, at that time,\r\nhe received her from the very midst of her enemies, and afterwards\r\nadvanced her in all things to the utmost of his power; ever busied on\r\nher account, and neglecting his own interest to secure hers, while some\r\npersons taking advantage of his absence, curtailed his territories on\r\nevery side: and, lastly, urged by what necessity, namely to rescue his\r\nson-in-law, whom the king had besieged, he engaged in a hazardous\r\nconflict, and took the king prisoner. This fortunate event, however,\r\nwas somewhat obscured by his own capture at Winchester, as I have\r\nrecorded in the transactions of the former year; though by the grace of\r\nGod, he showed himself, not so much an object of commiseration, as of\r\npraise, in that capture. For, when he saw that the royalist earls were\r\nso persevering in the pursuit that the business could not be gotten\r\nthrough without loss on his part, he sent forward all those for whom\r\nhe was under apprehension, and more especially the empress. When they\r\nhad proceeded far enough to escape in safety, he followed leisurely,\r\nthat the retreat might not resemble a flight, and received the attack\r\nof the pursuers himself; thus purchasing, by his own detention, the\r\nliberty of his friends. And now, even at the moment of his capture, no\r\none, as I have said above, perceived him either dispirited, or humbled\r\nin language: he seemed so far to tower above fortune, that he compelled\r\nhis persecutors, for I am loth to call them enemies, to respect him.\r\nWherefore the queen, though she might have remembered, that her husband\r\nhad been fettered by his command, yet never suffered a bond of any\r\nkind to be put upon him, nor presumed on her dignity to treat him\r\ndishonourably. And finally at Rochester, for thither he was conducted,\r\nhe went freely whither he pleased, to the churches below the castle,\r\nand conversed with whom he chose, the queen only being present (for\r\nafter her departure he was held in free custody in the keep) and so\r\ncalm and serene was his mind, that, getting money from his vassals in\r\nKent, he bought some valuable horses, which were both serviceable and\r\nbeneficial to him afterwards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1142.] EARL ROBERT IN PRISON.]\r\n\r\nThe earls, and those whose business it was to speak of such matters, at\r\nfirst, tried if he would allow of the king and himself being liberated\r\non equal terms. Though his countess, Mabil, out of solicitude for her\r\nbeloved husband, would have embraced these terms the moment she heard\r\nthem, being, through conjugal affection, bent on his liberation, yet\r\nhe, in his wiser policy, refused: asserting that a king and an earl\r\nwere not of equal importance; however, if they would allow all who\r\nhad been taken with him, or for him, to be set at liberty, to this he\r\nmight consent. But the earls and other royalists would not assent to\r\nthese terms; they were anxious indeed for the king’s liberty, but not\r\nat their own pecuniary loss: for earl Gilbert had taken William of\r\nSalisbury: and William de Ipres, Humphry de Bohun; and others had made\r\nsuch captures as they could, at Winchester, greedily expecting large\r\nsums for their ransom.\r\n\r\nNext attacking the earl another way, they were anxious to allure him\r\nwith magnificent promises, if so they might effect their purpose.\r\nWould he go over to the king’s side, and dismiss his sister, he should\r\ngovern the whole country: all things should await his decision: the\r\ncrown should be the only distinction between him and the king: over all\r\nothers he should rule as he pleased. The earl rejected these unbounded\r\npromises, with a memorable reply, which I wish posterity to hear, and\r\nto admire: “I am not my own master,” said he, “but am in another’s\r\npower; when I shall see myself at my own disposal, I promise to do\r\nevery thing which reason dictates on the matter you propound.”\r\n\r\nIrritated and incensed at this, when they could do nothing by fair\r\nmeans, they began to menace, that they would send him over sea to\r\nBoulogne, and keep him in perpetual bondage till death. Still, however,\r\nwith a serene countenance, dispelling their threats, he firmly and\r\ntruly protested, that he feared nothing less. For he relied on the\r\nspirit of his wife, the countess, and the courage of his partizans, who\r\nwould immediately send the king into Ireland, if they heard of any foul\r\ndeed perpetrated against himself.\r\n\r\nA month elapsed in these transactions; so difficult a work was it\r\nto effect the liberation of princes whom fortune had fettered with\r\nher chain.[569] But, at length, the supporters of the empress having\r\nconferred together, entreated the earl by divers messages, that “as he\r\ncould not do what he would,” according to the comic writer, “he would\r\ndo what he could:” he should allow therefore, the king and himself to\r\nbe set at liberty, on equal terms, “otherwise,” said they, “we fear\r\nlest the earls, inspirited by the consciousness of their great and most\r\ndistinguished exploit in making you captive, should attack us one by\r\none, reduce our castles, and even make an attempt upon your sister.”\r\n\r\nRobert, wrought upon at length, assented to the proposal of the legate\r\nand archbishop, but still on condition that none of the castles,\r\nor territory, should be restored, which had come under the power of\r\nthe empress or of any of her faithful adherents, since the capture\r\nof the king: but he could not by any means obtain the release of his\r\nfriends, as he had given offence to some persons, in rejecting, with\r\na kind of superciliousness their magnificent promises with respect\r\nto the government of the whole kingdom. And as they were extremely\r\nanxious that, for the royal dignity, the king should be first set at\r\nliberty, and then the earl; when he demurred to this, the legate and\r\nthe archbishop made oath, that if the king, after his own liberation,\r\nrefused to release the earl, they would forthwith deliver themselves up\r\ninto Robert’s power, to be conducted wherever he pleased. Nor did he\r\nrest here; for his sagacious mind discovered an additional security.\r\nIt might fall out, that the king, as often happens, listening to\r\nevil counsel, would consider the detention of his brother, and of\r\nthe archbishop, as of very little consequence, so that he himself\r\nwere at his ease. He demanded, therefore, from them both, separately,\r\ninstruments, with their seals, addressed to the pope, to the following\r\neffect; “That the sovereign pope was to understand, that they, for\r\nthe liberation of the king and the peace of the kingdom, had bound\r\nthemselves to the earl by this covenant, that, if the king refused\r\nto liberate him after his own release, themselves would willingly\r\nsurrender to his custody. Should it, therefore, come to this calamitous\r\nissue, they earnestly entreated, what it would well become the papal\r\ngoodness voluntarily to perform, that he would release them, who were\r\nhis suffragans, as well as the earl, from unjustifiable durance.” There\r\nwas something more to the same effect.\r\n\r\nThese writings, received from either prelate, Robert deposited in a\r\nplace of safety, and came to Winchester with them and a great company\r\nof the barons. The king also, as has been before observed, coming\r\nthither soon after, had a friendly interview with the earl. But\r\nalthough he, and all the earls present, eagerly busied themselves in\r\nbringing over Robert to their wishes, yet, “firm as a rock amid the\r\nocean” in his resistance, he rendered their attempts abortive, or\r\nrefuted them by argument. He affirmed, that, it was neither reasonable\r\nnor natural, that he should desert his sister, whose cause he had\r\njustly espoused, not for any benefit to himself, nor so much out of\r\ndislike to the king, as regard to his oath, which, they also ought to\r\nremember, it was impiety to violate, especially when he called to mind,\r\nthat he had been enjoined by the pope to respect the oath he had taken\r\nto his sister in the presence of his father. Thus failing of peace,\r\nthey severally departed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1142.] DESIGNS OF THE EMPRESS.]\r\n\r\nThe reason why I have not incorporated these events with the\r\ntransactions of the former year is that I did not then know them; for\r\nI have always dreaded to transmit anything to posterity, through my\r\nnarrative, the truth of which I could not perfectly vouch for. What,\r\nthen, I have to relate of the present year will commence as follows.\r\n\r\nThe respective parties of the empress and of the king, conducted\r\nthemselves with quiet forbearance from Christmas to Lent, anxious\r\nrather to preserve their own, than to ravage the possessions of others.\r\nThe king went to a distant part of the kingdom for the purpose of\r\nquelling some disturbances. Lent coming on gave all a respite from\r\nwar; in the midst of which the empress came with her party to Devizes,\r\nwhere her secret designs were debated. So much of them, however,\r\ntranspired that it was known that all her partizans had agreed to send\r\nfor the earl of Anjou, who was most interested in the defence of the\r\ninheritance of his wife and children in England. Men of respectability\r\nwere, therefore, despatched and such as might fitly execute a business\r\nof such magnitude. Not long after, nearly on the Easter holidays,\r\nthe king, while meditating, as it is said, some harsh measures, was\r\ndetained by an acute disease at Northampton; so severe, indeed, that\r\nhe was reported, almost throughout England, as being at the point of\r\ndeath. His sickness continued till after Pentecost, when returning\r\nhealth gradually restored him. In the meantime, the messengers\r\nreturning from Anjou, related the result of their mission to the\r\nempress and the princes in a second council, held at Devizes on the\r\noctaves of Pentecost. They said that the earl of Anjou in some measure\r\nfavoured the mission of the nobility, but that among them all he was\r\nonly well acquainted with the earl of Gloucester, of whose prudence and\r\nfidelity, greatness of mind and industry, he had long since had proof.\r\nWere he to make a voyage to him he would, as far as he was able, accede\r\nto his wishes: but that all other persons would expend their labour in\r\npassing and repassing to no purpose.\r\n\r\nThe hopes of all the assembly being thus excited, they entreated that\r\nthe earl would condescend to undertake this task on account of the\r\ninheritance of his sister and of his nephews. At first he excused\r\nhimself, alleging the difficulty of the business, the perilous journey,\r\nbeset with enemies on either side of the sea; that it would be attended\r\nwith danger to his sister, as in his absence those persons would be\r\nhardly able to defend her, who, distrusting even the strength of their\r\nown party, had nearly deserted her during his captivity. Yielding at\r\nlength to the general desire, he demanded hostages, especially from\r\nthose who were considered as the chief persons, to be taken with\r\nhim into Normandy, and to be pledges, as well to the earl of Anjou\r\nas to the empress; and that all, continuing at Oxford, should unite\r\nin defending her from injury to the utmost while he was absent. His\r\npropositions were eagerly approved, and hostages given him to be\r\nconducted into Normandy.\r\n\r\nRobert, therefore, bidding adieu to his sister, and taking with him his\r\nhostages and some light troops, proceeded by safe marches to Wareham,\r\nwhich town and castle he had long since entrusted to his eldest son\r\nWilliam. There, soon after the festival of St. John, committing\r\nhimself, by the grace of God, to the ocean, with such vessels as he\r\nthen possessed, he weighed anchor. When they were about mid-sea, a\r\ntempest arising, all except two were dispersed; some were driven back,\r\nand some carried beyond their destination. Two only, in one of which\r\nwas the earl with his most faithful adherents, keeping their course,\r\narrived in the wished-for port. Proceeding thus to Caen, he sent\r\nmessengers for the earl of Anjou. The earl came without reluctance,\r\nbut stated his difficulties, and those not a few, to the object of the\r\nembassy when proposed to him; among others that he should be detained\r\nfrom coming into England by the rebellion of many castles in Normandy.\r\nThis circumstance delayed the earl of Gloucester’s return longer than\r\nhe had intended: for, that he might deprive the earl of Anjou of every\r\nevasion, he assisted him in subduing ten castles in Normandy. The\r\nnames of which were Tenerchebrei, Seithilaret, Brichesart, Alani,\r\nBastenborg, Triveres, Castel de Vira, Placeit, Vilers, Moreton. Yet\r\neven by this activity, he furthered the end of his mission but little.\r\nThe earl of Anjou stated fresh causes, as the former were done away,\r\nto excuse his coming into England. Indeed, as a very singular favour,\r\nhe permitted his eldest son, by the empress, to accompany his uncle to\r\nEngland, by whose presence the chiefs might be encouraged to defend\r\nthe cause of the lawful heir. The youth is named Henry, after his\r\ngrandfather; may he hereafter resemble him in happiness and in power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1142.] RETURN OF THE EARL OF GLOUCESTER.]\r\n\r\nIn England, in the meantime, the king seizing the opportunity of the\r\nearl’s absence came unexpectedly to Wareham, and finding it slightly\r\ngarrisoned, he burned and plundered the town, and immediately got\r\npossession of the castle also. Not content with this, as he saw fortune\r\ninclined to favour him, three days before the festival of St. Michael,\r\nby an unexpected chance,[570] he burned the city of Oxford, and laid\r\nsiege to the castle, in which was the empress with her domestic guards.\r\nThis he did with such determined resolution, that he declared no hope\r\nof advantage or fear of loss should induce him to depart till the\r\ncastle was delivered up, and the empress surrendered to his power.\r\nShortly after, all the nobility of the empress’s party, ashamed of\r\nbeing absent from their sovereign in violation of their compact,\r\nassembled in large bodies at Wallingford, with the determination of\r\nattacking the king if he would risk a battle in the open plain; but\r\nthey had no intention of assailing him within the city, as Robert\r\nearl of Gloucester had so fortified it with ditches that it appeared\r\nimpregnable unless by fire.\r\n\r\nThese rumours becoming prevalent in Normandy, Robert hastened his\r\nreturn. He embarked, therefore, somewhat more than three, but less\r\nthan four hundred horsemen, on board fifty-two vessels; to these\r\nwere added two which he took at sea on his return. God’s grace so\r\nsingularly favoured his pious resolution that not one ship, out of\r\nso great a number, was separated, but all nearly close together, or\r\ngently proceeding one before the other, ploughed the calm bosom of the\r\ndeep. Nor did the waves violently dash against the fleet, but rather\r\nseemed subserviently to further their passage, like that most beautiful\r\nappearance at sea when the wave gradually approaching gently breaks\r\nupon the shore. Thus making the port of Wareham, these favoured vessels\r\nrestored the earl and all his companions to the wishes of their friends.\r\n\r\nHe had at first thought of landing at Southampton, at once to wreak\r\nhis vengeance both on its inhabitants and on their lord: but this\r\nresolution was changed through the repeated entreaties of the Vituli,\r\nwho were fearful that their dearest connexions, who resided at\r\nSouthampton, would be involved in the general calamity. These are a\r\nkind of mariners, who are known by the name of Vituli; and as they are\r\nhis faithful adherents he thought fit to listen to their petitions,\r\nand desist from his design. Again, it appeared more dignified to\r\nreturn to the place whence he had departed, and to recover by force\r\nwhat he had lost by a similar mode. Reducing, therefore, immediately\r\nthe port and town, he laid siege to the castle, which by its strength\r\nstimulated the spirit, not to call it obstinacy, of those of the\r\nking’s choicest troops who defended it. Yet, nevertheless, soon after,\r\nthe garrison, shaken in their resolution by the engines of the earl,\r\nand greatly alarmed, begged a truce, that, as is the custom of the\r\nmilitary, they might demand assistance from the king, consenting to\r\ndeliver up the castle if he refused to come by a certain day. This,\r\nthough he was possessed with the utmost impatience to become master of\r\nthe fortress, was very agreeable to the earl, as it led him to suppose\r\nit might draw off Stephen from besieging his sister. We may imagine\r\nwhat firmness of mind this man possessed who, with little more than\r\nthree hundred horsemen, and as yet joined by no succours in England,\r\ncould undauntedly await the king, who was reported to have more than a\r\nthousand; for many persons had joined the siege, not so much through\r\ndislike to the empress as through the hope of plunder.\r\n\r\nHowever, when it was certified that the king, from that resolution\r\nwhich I have before mentioned, refused assistance to the besieged at\r\nWareham, the earl obtained the castle, and with the same attack subdued\r\nthe island of Portland, which they had fortified, as well as a third\r\ncastle, called Lullewarden, which belonged to a certain chamberlain,\r\ncalled William of Glastonbury, who had lately revolted from the\r\nempress. Robert then, at the beginning of Advent, summoned the whole of\r\nMatilda’s partisans to Cirencester: where all resolving to afford their\r\nsovereign every possible assistance, they meditated a march to Oxford;\r\ncourageously determining to give the king battle, unless he retreated.\r\nBut as they were on their route, the pleasing account reached them,\r\nthat the empress had escaped from the blockaded castle at Oxford, and\r\nwas now at Wallingford in security. Turning aside thither, then, at the\r\nsuggestion of their sovereign, since the soldiers who had remained at\r\nher departure, after delivering up the castle, had gone away without\r\nmolestation, and the holidays admonished them to repose awhile, they\r\nresolved to abstain from battle, and retired to their homes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: [A.D. 1142.] ESCAPE OF THE EMPRESS.]\r\n\r\nI would very willingly subjoin the manner of the empress’s liberation,\r\ndid I know it to a certainty; for it is undoubtedly one of God’s\r\nmanifest miracles. This, however, is sufficiently notorious, that,\r\nthrough fear of the earl’s approach, many of the besiegers at Oxford\r\nstole away wherever they were able, and the rest remitted their\r\nvigilance, and kept not so good a look out as before; more anxious\r\nfor their own safety, in case it came to a battle, than bent on the\r\ndestruction of others.[571] This circumstance being remarked by the\r\ntownsmen, the empress, with only four soldiers, made her escape through\r\na small postern, and passed the river. Afterwards, as necessity\r\nsometimes, and indeed, almost always, discovers means and ministers\r\ncourage, she went to Abingdon on foot, and thence reached Wallingford\r\non horse-back. But this I purpose describing more fully, if, by God’s\r\npermission, I shall ever learn the truth of it from those who were\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Adultery, punished in

Anglia Sacra, II. 45-7. If Malmesbury wrote the\r\nmiracles of St. Andrew, a work which is attributed to him, he was born\r\nthe 30th of November.\r\n\r\n[4] He says he also collected many books for the monastic library: and\r\nmentions others which he had seen at Canterbury, Bury St. Edmunds, &c.\r\nGale, tom. iii. pp. 376, 298.\r\n\r\n[5] Some notion of his diligence may perhaps be afforded by the\r\nfollowing list of his writings.\r\n\r\n1. _De Gestis Regum._ The History of the Kings of England. The first\r\nthree books were probably written soon after the year 1120. Malmesbury\r\nintimates that he then hesitated for a time on the expediency of\r\ncontinuing his history; but at length having determined on prosecuting\r\nhis design, he dedicated the fourth and fifth books to Robert earl of\r\nGloucester; at whose request he afterwards composed\r\n\r\n2. _Historiæ Novellæ._ The Modern History. This appears to have been\r\nbegun after the death of Henry I; probably not long before 1140.\r\n\r\n3. _De Gestis Pontificum._ The History of the Prelates of England\r\ncontaining, in four books, an account of the bishops, and of the\r\nprincipal monasteries, from the conversion of the English, by St.\r\nAugustine, to 1123; to which he added a fifth\r\n\r\n4. _De Vita Aldhelmi._ The Life of St. Aldhelm: which was completed in\r\n1125. It is very reasonably conjectured that this last was published\r\nseparately and some time after the others; as, though there are many\r\nancient MSS. of the first four books, one copy only has yet been\r\ndiscovered with the fifth. The former were published by Saville, but\r\nfrom very faulty and scanty MSS. The latter by H. Wharton, and by Gale;\r\nbut also very defectively.\r\n\r\n5. _De Vita S. Dunstani._ The Life of S. Dunstan, in two books. MS.\r\nBodley Rawlinson, 263. This was written at the request of the monks of\r\nGlastonbury, for whom he had previously composed the following three:\r\n\r\n6. _Vita S. Patricii._ The Life of S. Patrick, in two books. Leland,\r\nCollectanea, 3, 272, has extracts from it, but no MS. has hitherto\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\n7. _Miracula S. Benigni._ The Miracles of S. Benignus. This has not\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\n8. _Passio S. Indracti._ The Martyrdom of S. Indract. MS. Bodley Digby,\r\n112. This he translated and abridged from the Anglo-Saxon. Abbreviated\r\nin Capgrave’s Legenda Nova.\r\n\r\n9. _De Antiquitate Glastoniensis Ecclesiæ._ The History of Glastonbury.\r\nIt is addressed to Henry bishop of Winchester, and was of course\r\nwritten after 1129. Printed in Gale’s Collection, t. 3, and by Hearne,\r\nfrom an interpolated MS.\r\n\r\n10. _Vita S. Wulstani Episcopi Wigorniensis._ The Life of S. Wulstan,\r\nBishop of Worcester. A Translation from the Anglo-Saxon, addressed to\r\nPrior Guarin, between 1124 and 1140. The greater part of it has been\r\nprinted. Anglia Sacra, t. 2.\r\n\r\n11. _Chronica._ Chronicles, in three books. See p. 480. This work is\r\nprobably lost.\r\n\r\n12. _Miracula S. Elfgifæ._ The Miracles of Elfgifa, in metre. A\r\nspecimen of these rhymes, there printed as prose, may be seen in the De\r\nGestis Pontif. f. 143: they were apparently written while he was very\r\nyoung; as, before 1125, he says, “_quondam_ cecini.”\r\n\r\n13. _Itinerarium Joannis Abbatis Meldunensis versus Romam._ The\r\nItinerary of John Abbat of Malmesbury to Rome. This was drawn up,\r\nafter 1140, from the relation of another monk of that foundation who\r\naccompanied the abbat. Leland, Collect. 3, 272, ed. 1774, mentions it\r\nas being very curious. It does not occur, but it was formerly in the\r\npossession of Bale.\r\n\r\n14. _Expositio Threnorum Hieremiæ._ A Commentary on the Lamentations of\r\nJeremiah. MS. Bodley, 868. Abridged from Paschasius Radbert, probably\r\nabout 1136.\r\n\r\n15. _De Miraculis Divæ Mariæ libri quatuor Gul. Cantoris Malmsburie._\r\nThe Miracles of the Blessed Virgin, in four books. Leland, Coll. 4. 155.\r\n\r\n16. _De Serie Evangelistarum, Carmine._ The Order of the Evangelists,\r\nin verse. Leland, Collect. 4. 157. These two have not occurred.\r\n\r\n17. _De Miraculis B. Andreæ._ The Miracles of S. Andrew. MS. Cotton.\r\nNero, E. 1. Abridged from a very prolix work.\r\n\r\n18. _Abbreviatio Amalarii de Ecclesiasticis Officiis._ Amalarius on\r\nEcclesiastical Offices, abridged. MS. Lambeth. 380.\r\n\r\n19. _Epitome Historiæ Aimonis Floriacensis._ The History of Haimo of\r\nFlory, abridged. MS. Bodley, Selden. Arch. B. 32.\r\n\r\nSeveral other works are attributed to him by Tanner, on the authority\r\nof Bale and Pits.\r\n\r\n[6] These remarks on the character and style of our author must be\r\nreceived, as they say, _cum grano salis_. They more justly evince the\r\nzeal of Mr. Sharpe than the merits of Malmesbury’s composition. The\r\nclassical reader will probably lament with me that our early historians\r\nshould have used a style so cumbersome and uninviting. To this general\r\ncensure Malmesbury is certainly no exception. His Latinity is rude and\r\nrepulsive, and the true value of his writings arises from the fidelity\r\nwith which he has recorded facts, which he had either himself witnessed\r\nor had obtained from eye-witnesses.\r\n\r\n[7] This valuable work has been published, together with Bede’s\r\nEcclesiastical History, in a preceding volume of this series.\r\n\r\n[8] See his prologue to the Life of Wulstan, Anglia Sacra, ii. 243.\r\n\r\n[9] Some of these allusions are occasionally marked in the notes.\r\n\r\n[10] A considerable portion of the present work was printed anonymously\r\nas a continuation of Bede, at Heidelberg, in 1587. The whole,\r\ntogether with the History of the Prelates, was first printed by Sir\r\nHenry Saville, who appears to have consulted several copies in the\r\n“Scriptores post Bedam,” London, 1596, fol. This was reprinted, but\r\nwith many additional errors, at Frankfort, 1601, fol. Saville’s\r\ndivision into chapters, in the second book more especially, has no\r\nauthority; but as it appeared sufficiently convenient, it has been\r\nadopted: the division of the sections is nearly the same throughout all\r\nthe MSS.\r\n\r\n[11] Robert, Earl of Gloucester, the Mecænas of his age, was a natural\r\nson of Henry I., and a man of great talents and of unshaken fidelity.\r\nHe married Mabil, daughter of Robert Fitzhamon, by whom he had a\r\nnumerous issue. He died October 31, A.D. 1147.\r\n\r\n[12] This alludes to those invaluable records, the Saxon Chronicles.\r\nThese, as originally compiled, have been already published in the\r\npresent Series of Monkish Historians.\r\n\r\n[13] Elward, or Ethelwerd, was a noble Saxon, great-great-grandson\r\nof King Ethelred, brother of Alfred. He abridged and translated the\r\nSaxon Chronicle into Latin, published in the present Series. He lived\r\napparently in the time of Edgar, towards the close of the tenth century.\r\n\r\n[14] Eadmer, a monk and precentor of Christ-Church, Canterbury, and\r\npupil of Archbishop Anselm, together with a variety of other works,\r\nwrote “Historia Novorum,” or, a history of modern times, from A.D. 1066\r\nto 1122.\r\n\r\n[15] MS. Anselmi. Eadmer at first brought down his history to the death\r\nof Archbishop Anselm only, A.D. 1109, but afterwards continued it to\r\nthe decease of Ralph, A.D. 1122.\r\n\r\n[16] Virgilii Ecl. VI. v. 10.\r\n\r\n[17] Helena’s origin has been much contested: Gibbon decides that she\r\nwas daughter of an innkeeper. The word “Stabularia,” literally implies\r\nan ostler-wench; and it has been conjectured that it was applied to\r\nher, by the Jews and Gentiles, on account of her building a church on\r\nthe spot where stood the stable in which our Lord was born.\r\n\r\n[18] Various periods have been assigned for the British settlement\r\nin Armorica, or Bretagne; but the subject is still involved in great\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\n[19] Some MSS. read _juvenilis_, others _militaris_.\r\n\r\n[20] Some MSS. read _succensæ_.\r\n\r\n[21] These are supposed to be long vessels, somewhat like galleys, and\r\nit would appear, as well from Brompton, col. 897, as from so small\r\na number containing a body equal to a military enterprise like that\r\ndescribed here and in other places, that they were of considerable\r\nburden.\r\n\r\n[22] Bede i. 15. The people of Kent and of the Isle of Wight were\r\nJutes; the East, South, and West Saxons, were Saxons; and of the Angles\r\ncame the East-Angles, Mid-Angles, Mercians, and Northumbrians. For the\r\nlimits of the several kingdoms of the Heptarchy, see Chap. VI. The\r\nCottonian MS. (Claud. ix.) reads, _Wichtis_.\r\n\r\n[23] At Aylesford, A.D. 455; at Crayford, 457; at Wippedsfleet\r\n(supposed, but very doubtful, Ebbsfleet, in Thanet), 465; and the\r\nfourth, A.D. 473, the place not mentioned. See Saxon Chronicle, A.D.\r\n465.\r\n\r\n[24] Said to be Bannesdown, near Bath. Giraldus Cambrensis says, the\r\nimage of the Virgin was fixed on the inside of Arthur’s shield, that he\r\nmight kiss it in battle. Bede erroneously ascribes this event to A.D.\r\n493. (Bede’s Ecclesiastical History, b. i. c. 6.)\r\n\r\n[25] According to Sprott, Hengist died in 488, and was succeeded by\r\nhis son Octa, vel Osca. Osca died A.D. 408, and Esc, his son, ascended\r\nthe throne. In the year 522 Ermenric, the father of king Ethelbert,\r\nreigned. Ethelbert became king of Kent in 558.\r\n\r\n[26] The difference seems to have arisen from carelessness in the\r\nscribe; as the Saxon Chronicle states him to have ascended the throne\r\nA.D. 560, and to have died 616: which is exactly fifty-six years,\r\nalthough it asserts him to have reigned only 53.\r\n\r\n[27] See Wilkins’s “Leges Anglo-Saxonicæ,” and the Textus Roffensis.\r\n\r\n[28] The name of the second queen of Ethelbert is not mentioned,\r\nprobably on account of this incest.\r\n\r\n[29] St. Peter, it is said, appeared to Laurentius at night, and\r\nreproaching him for his cowardice, severely chastised him with a\r\nscourge; the marks of which had the effect here mentioned the next day.\r\nBede ii. 6. According to Sprott, St. Laurentius became archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, A.D. 610.\r\n\r\n[30] St. Augustine’s, Canterbury, completed, according to Sprott, A.D.\r\n663.\r\n\r\n[31] Chelles, near Paris.\r\n\r\n[32] Theodore, archbishop of Canterbury, was a native of Tarsus in\r\nCilicia, and a prelate of great learning; but it being apprehended by\r\nPope Vitalian that he might rather incline to the doctrines of the\r\nGreek Church, Adrian was sent with him, as a kind of superintendent,\r\nand was appointed abbat of St. Augustine’s.\r\n\r\n[33] See book ii. chap. 13, “but this and every other,” &c. Some\r\neditions omit this passage altogether.\r\n\r\n[34] Wansdike, in Wiltshire.\r\n\r\n[35] Virgil, Æn. ii. 390.\r\n\r\n[36] Bradford on Avon. See Sax. Chron. A.D. 652.\r\n\r\n[37] Pen, in Somersetshire.\r\n\r\n[38] Malmesbury wrote a History of Glastonbury, which is printed\r\nin Gale’s Collection, vol. iii. and by Hearne, in the History of\r\nGlastonbury, and from this work he extracts this account. Sharpe gives\r\nit [from “But since,” &c. to “character so munificent” in page 28, line\r\n2], in a note as a various reading of one of the MSS. The note occupies\r\nthe greater part of seven pages from 25 to 31 in Sharpe’s original\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n[39] There is a Life of Gildas, written not long after this history, by\r\nCaradoc of Lancarvon, in which we are told, that, while he was residing\r\nat Glastonbury, a prince of that country carried off Arthur’s queen and\r\nlodged her there; that Arthur immediately besieged it, but, through the\r\nmediation of the abbat, and of Gildas, consented, at length, to receive\r\nhis wife again and to depart peaceably.\r\n\r\n[40] The ordeal was an appeal to heaven to decide immediately on the\r\njustice of the cause. There were many modes of this whimsical trial;\r\nas by handling hot iron, plunging the arm into hot water, throwing the\r\naccused into water, &c. If, after three days, the party exhibited no\r\nmark of burning in the two former; or if he did not sink in the latter\r\nexperiment, he was considered innocent. The whole was conducted with\r\ngreat solemnity; the ritual may be seen in Spelman, voce Ordalium.\r\n\r\n[41] The Saxon mode of interment appears frequently to have been under\r\npyramids or obelisks. See Anglia Sacra, ii. 110.\r\n\r\n[42] St. Germanus drew up a body of his new converts in a valley\r\nsurrounded on every side by mountains, and, on the approach of their\r\nenemies, ordered that on a given signal, all should shout “Hallelujah.”\r\nThe sudden sound, being reverberated by the surrounding mountains,\r\nstruck their foes with such a panic, that they instantly fled. See\r\nBede, Hist. Eccl. b. i. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[43] Patrick is said to have floated over, from Ireland, on this altar,\r\nand to have landed near Padstow in Cornwall. Gough’s Camden, i. 19.\r\nMalmesbury appears to have been misled by the Glastonbury historian, so\r\nas to confound St. Patrick with St. Petrock. From the latter, the town\r\nof Padstow derives its name, as is proved by Whitaker, in his Ancient\r\nCathedral of Cornwall.\r\n\r\n[44] On their return from a pilgrimage to Rome they designed visiting\r\nGlastonbury, out of respect to St. Patrick; and filled their scrips\r\nwith parsley and various other seeds, which they purposed carrying to\r\nIreland, but their staves being tipped with brass, which was mistaken\r\nfor gold, they were murdered for the supposed booty.\r\n\r\n[45] It is understood as synonymous with hide, or as much land as one\r\nplough could till.\r\n\r\n[46] Cuthred. According to the Saxon Chronicle, he bestowed on him 3000\r\nhides of land.\r\n\r\n[47] Bede, in “Chronicles of the Anglo-Saxons,” p. 267.\r\n\r\n[48] Where this river was is not known: it has been conjectured it\r\nshould be Avon. Malmesbury is also said to have been originally called\r\nBladon.\r\n\r\n[49] De Laudibus Virginitatis. His “Commendation of Virginity,” was\r\nfirst written in prose: and was printed by H. Wharton, 4to. 1693. He\r\nafterwards versified it with occasional amplifications or omissions.\r\nSome MSS. give the date as 671: others 672; and others again 675.\r\nSee Canisius, Antiquæ Lectiones, t. i. 713. Ed. Basnagii. The whole\r\nworks of Aldhelm have been collected for the first time by the present\r\neditor, and form vol. i. of PATRES ECCLESIÆ ANGLICANÆ.\r\n\r\n[50] Malmesbury afterwards wrote the life of Aldhelm. It ought to form\r\nthe fifth book “_de Gentis Pontificum_,” but has never yet been printed\r\nin the same volume with the four preceding books.\r\n\r\n[51] See Bede, b. iv. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[52] The Saxon Chronicle and Florence of Worcester mention his attacks\r\non the South Saxons, but do not notice the East Angles.\r\n\r\n[53] See Wilkins’s Leges Anglo-Saxonicæ.\r\n\r\n[54] Some manuscripts omit all that follows to “Berthwald, archbishop\r\nof Canterbury,” p. 35, and insert in place of it “More especially that\r\nat Glastonbury most celebrated in our days, which he erected in a low\r\nretired situation, in order that the monks might more eagerly thirst\r\nafter heavenly, in proportion as they were less affected by earthly\r\nthings.” Sharpe inserts the shorter passage in his text, and gives the\r\nlonger in a note.\r\n\r\n[55] See Kemble’s Charters, vol. i. p. 85.\r\n\r\n[56] The Antiquities of Glastonbury were published about the same time\r\nby Gale, vol. iii. and by Hearne.\r\n\r\n[57] The 25th of May.\r\n\r\n[58] Bede, Eccl. Hist. b. iv. c. 7-10.\r\n\r\n[59] All this passage, from “What splendour, p. 35, to persuasion,” is\r\nomitted in some MSS., and is given in a note by Hardy and Sharpe; but\r\nit seems almost necessary to the context.\r\n\r\n[60] Malmesbury here perpetuates the error of the transcriber of the\r\nSaxon Chronicle, in assigning thirty-one years to Cynewolf, for as\r\nhe came to the throne in 756, and was killed in 784, consequently he\r\nreigned about twenty-nine years. Perhaps he wrote, correctly, “_uno de\r\ntriginta annis_,” conjectures Mr. Hardy.\r\n\r\n[61] Supposed Dalston near Carlisle, or Dawston near Ichborough.\r\n\r\n[62] Malmesbury here confounds the ancient monastery of Banchor, near\r\nChester, with the more modern see of Bangor in Carnarvonshire.\r\n\r\n[63] Ovid. Trist. 1. 9, v. 5.\r\n\r\n[64] Cadwalla, king of the Britons, having slain Eanfrid and Osric,\r\nA.D. 634, had usurped the government of Northumbria.\r\n\r\n[65] When he was seated at table and just about to commence dinner,\r\nthe royal almoner informed the king that a great number of poor were\r\nassembled in the street, asking relief; on which he immediately ordered\r\nthe whole of the provisions to be distributed, and the silver dish also\r\nto be cut into pieces, and divided amongst them. See Bede, b. iii. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[66] Juv. Sat. vii. 202.\r\n\r\n[67] Bambrough in Northumberland.

Bede’s bones were afterwards laid in the same coffin.\r\n\r\n[69] The horse lay down under his rider in great agony; but recovered\r\nby rolling on the spot and cropping the grass. A person carried away\r\nsome of the earth, which he hung up against a post in the wall: the\r\nhouse caught fire and was burnt with the exception of the timber to\r\nwhich the bag was tied. See Bede, b. iii. c. 9, 10; and for the other\r\nstories, c. 13.\r\n\r\n[70] The principal points in dispute were, the time of celebrating\r\nEaster and the form of the tonsure. See Bede, Eccl.

The first, Etheldrida, was\r\ndivorced from him, on account of her love of celibacy, and became a\r\nnun. Wilfrid, bishop of Hexham, was several times expelled his see.\r\nElected bishop of York, A.D. 664, he was expelled in 678. He was\r\nrecalled to Northumbria in 687, and again expelled 692. He died A.D.\r\n709, having been reinstated by the pope. See Bede v. 19. and Sax. Chron.\r\n\r\n[74] Virg. Æn. vi. 815.\r\n\r\n[75] The country was laid waste by the Danes, A.D. 793, and continued\r\nto be disturbed by them throughout the reigns of Alfred and Ethelred.\r\nThe great devastation was made by William the Conqueror A.D. 1069.\r\n\r\n[76] This is not quite correct: Jarrow, one of Benedict’s monasteries,\r\nis on the river Tyne.\r\n\r\n[77] Benedict surnamed Biscop, a noble Northumbrian, quitted the\r\nservice of king Oswy, when he had attained his twenty-fifth year, and\r\ntravelled to Rome five several times; occupying himself while there,\r\neither in learning the Roman ritual, or in collecting books, pictures,\r\nand ornaments of various descriptions for the monasteries he had\r\nfounded at Wearmouth: he also brought over masons from France to build\r\na church after the Roman manner; as well as artificers in glass. See\r\nBede’s Lives of the Abbats of Wearmouth and Jarrow.\r\n\r\n[78] “... lapidei tabulatus,” this seems intended to designate\r\nbuildings with courses of stone in a regular manner, which is also\r\nimplied by him, De Gestis Pontif. lib. iii. f. 148. Bede, whom he here\r\nfollows, affords no assistance as to the precise meaning: he merely\r\nstates, that Benedict caused a church to be erected after the Roman\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\n[79] The monks of Glastonbury used all possible means to obtain\r\nrelics of saints. See the curious account of a contention concerning\r\nthe body of St. Dunstan, which those monks asserted they had stolen\r\nfrom Canterbury, after it had been burnt by the Danes, in the time of\r\nEthelred, in Whartoni Anglia Sacra, vol. ii. p. 222.\r\n\r\n[80] Eccles.

He\r\ndied Oct. 10, 644.\r\n\r\n[89] Alcuin, a native of Northumbria, and educated at York, through\r\nhis learning and talents became the intimate friend and favourite of\r\nCharlemagne, for whom he transcribed, with his own hand, the Holy\r\nScriptures. This relic is now preserved in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[90] See this epistle at length in Alcuini Op. vol. i. p. 52. Epist. 38.\r\n\r\n[91] Others say he was buried at St. Martin’s, at Tours, where he died,\r\nApril 18, 804. His works will be included in PATRES ECCLESIÆ ANGLICANÆ.\r\n\r\n[92] The Life of Charlemagne, by Eginhard, who was secretary to that\r\nmonarch. Du Chesne Script. Franc. tom. ii. It is one of the most\r\namusing books of the period.\r\n\r\n[93] The mayors of the palace seem originally to have merely regulated\r\nthe king’s household, but by degrees they acquired so much power,\r\nthat Pepin the elder, maternal grandfather of him here mentioned, had\r\nalready become in effect, king of France. They first appear to have\r\nusurped the regal power under Clovis II. A.D. 638.\r\n\r\n[94] Malmesbury differs from all the best authorities, who assign\r\nonly six years to his reign. He ascended the throne A.D. 759, and was\r\nexpelled A.D. 765.\r\n\r\n[95] Osred, through a conspiracy of his nobles, had been deposed, and,\r\nafter receiving the tonsure, was compelled to go into exile. Two years\r\nafter, induced by the promises and oaths of certain of the Northumbrian\r\nchiefs, he returned, but being deserted by his forces, he was made\r\nprisoner and put to death by the order of Ethelred.

Osred was expelled from his kingdom, A.D. 790, and Ethelred was\r\nrestored after an exile of twelve years.--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[96] This letter is not yet published in Alcuini Opera.\r\n\r\n[97] Epist. xlii. Op. tom. i. p. 57.\r\n\r\n[98] This is not quite correct: Osbald was elected by a party to\r\nsucceed him; but after a very short period he was deposed, and the\r\ngovernment devolved on Eardulf. Eardulf after a few years was driven\r\ninto exile; went to Rome, and, it would seem, was restored to his\r\nkingdom, by the influence of Charlemagne, A.D. 808. V. Sim. Dunelm.\r\ncol. 117, and Eginhardi Annales, Duchesne, 2, 255.\r\n\r\n[99] It would appear that Penda was not the first king, but the first\r\nof any note. Hen. Huntingdon assigns the origin of the kingdom to about\r\nthe year 584 under Crida, who was succeeded, in the year 600, by Pybba;\r\nCeorl came to the throne in 610, and Penda in 626. See H. Hunt, f. 181,\r\n184--b.\r\n\r\n[100] King of the Britons, see Bede, b. ii. ch. 20. It was by his\r\nassistance that Cadwalla defeated Edwin, king of Northumbria, at\r\nHatfield, Oct. 12, A.D. 633.\r\n\r\n[101] This was by paying to his relatives his weregild, or the legal\r\nprice of his blood; for all, from the king to the slave, had their\r\nestablished value. One moiety, only, of the weregild went to the family\r\nof the murdered person; the other went into the public purse.\r\n\r\n[102] Ethelbald had been frequently exhorted by the king to make\r\nconfession of his transgressions, but had constantly declined it. At\r\nlast being seized with sickness, he appears to have imagined that he\r\nsaw two angels approach with a very small volume, in which were written\r\nthe few good actions he had ever performed; when immediately a large\r\ncompany of demons advancing, display another book of enormous bulk and\r\nweight, containing all his evil deeds, which are read to him; after\r\nwhich, asserting their claim to the sinner against the angels, they\r\nstrike him on the head and feet, as symptoms of his approaching end.\r\nBede, b. v. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[103] Boniface, whose original name was Winfred, after unwearied labour\r\nin the conversion of various nations in Germany, by which he acquired\r\nthe honourable appellation of Apostle of the Germans, at length\r\nsuffered martyrdom in Friesland. A collected edition of his works forms\r\nvolumes xv. and xvi. of PATRES ECCLESIÆ ANGLICANÆ by the editor of\r\nthis work. One of the original churches, built by him in Saxony, still\r\nexists in the Duchy of Gotha, at a little village called Gierstedt.\r\n\r\n[104] See this epistle at length in Spelmanni Concilia, vol. i. page\r\n232, and reprinted by Wilkins, Concilia, i. 87, also in Bonifacii\r\nOpera, &c.\r\n\r\n[105] The Winedi were seated on the western bank of the Vistula, near\r\nthe Baltic. In Wilkins, it is “apud Persas,” among the Persians.\r\n\r\n[106] Lullus was appointed his successor by Boniface, on setting out\r\nfor Friesland, in 755; he died A.D. 785.\r\n\r\n[107] The value of the mancus is doubtful; sometimes it appears to mean\r\nthe same with the mark, at others it is supposed equal to thirty pence\r\nof the money of that time. The gold manca is supposed to be eight to\r\nthe pound, which was probably the coin sent to the pope.\r\n\r\n[108] See this entire, Usserii Veterum Epistolarum Hibernicarum\r\nSylloge, epist. 18. p. 36; and Alcuini Opera, tom. i. p. 6, epist. 3.\r\n\r\n[109] The dalmatic was a garment worn by the clergy, and sometimes by\r\nprinces. Its name is said to have been derived from its invention in\r\nDalmatia. The pall here apparently signifies an upper vesture also,\r\nin form resembling a cloak without sleeves; but it has a variety of\r\nmeanings. See Du Cange, and note at p. 44, of Bede’s Eccles. History.\r\n\r\n[110] Kenulf made Cuthred king of Kent, A.D. 798. Eadbert had been\r\ndreadfully mutilated by having his eyes put out and his hands cut off.\r\nSee chap. i.\r\n\r\n[111] “Qui agros non habebant.” These words refer to an inferior class\r\nof gentry, as he mentions the people at large, “populus,” afterwards.\r\n\r\n[112] Redwald was not the first king of East Anglia, but the first who\r\nbecame distinguished. In the year 571, Uffa assumed the title of king:\r\nhe was succeeded by his son, Titil, in 578 who was followed by Redwald,\r\nhis son. See Bede, b. ii. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[113] According to the Saxon Chronicle, A.D. 921, that is, the 21st of\r\nEdward the Elder, and the fiftieth from the murder of king Edmund. Now\r\nfollowing this statement, as Edward succeeded his father, Alfred A.D.\r\n901, the expulsion of the Danes would be the twentieth of his reign. In\r\nFlorence of Worcester the union of the kingdoms under Edward the Elder\r\nis assigned to the year 918.--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[114] Sleda was not the first, but their times are uncertain. See\r\nFlorence of Worcester, who calls him the son of Escwine, whom Henry of\r\nHuntingdon considers to have been the first king of Essex.\r\n\r\n[115] Brother to St. Chad, bishop of Lichfield. See Bede, b. iii. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[116] Here seems an oversight which may be supplied from Florence of\r\nWorcester. “Swithed succeeded Selred, and held the sovereignty some\r\nyears; after whom few native kings ruled in Essex, for in the same year\r\nthat Egbert conquered Kent, they surrendered to his power.” Selred died\r\n746; their submission took place 823. It would appear, however, from\r\nthe authorities adduced by Mr. Turner, Hist. of Anglo-Saxons, vol. i.\r\np. 318, that Selred was in fact king of East Anglia.\r\n\r\n[117] The kingdom of Sussex was founded by Ælla, who arrived in Britain\r\nwith three vessels, and accompanied by his three sons, A.D. 477. He\r\nseems to have attained a very high degree of power, and was succeeded\r\nby his son Cissa.--The affairs of this kingdom are extremely obscure;\r\nit appears to have been sometimes dependent on Kent and sometimes on\r\nWessex until finally united to the latter by Egbert, A.D. 823.\r\n\r\n[118] The early adventures of Egbert are found only in Malmesbury. He\r\ndoes not observe the order in which these events happened.\r\n\r\n[119] The printed text of the former editions places the battle of\r\nHellendun, A.D. 806. Several MSS. have 826, one 825, and two only\r\nappear to adopt the correct year 824, as inserted above. These are--The\r\nArundel MS. No. 35, Brit. Mus. and the MS. in Trinity Coll. Cam. R. 14.\r\nThe place is variously conjectured: Wilton in Wiltshire; Hillingdon in\r\nMiddlesex; and near Highworth in Wilts.\r\n\r\n[120] Malmesbury, in following the Saxon Chronicle, is two years\r\nearlier than the Northern Chronicles.\r\n\r\n[121] See Saxon Chronicle, A.D. 823-825.\r\n\r\n[122] Roger, bishop of Salisbury, seized it in like manner to his own\r\nuse, A.D. 1118, and held it till his death, 1159.\r\n\r\n[123] Alluding to the Rome-scot, or Peter’s-pence, a penny from each\r\nhouse, paid on the festival of St. Peter. Its origin and application\r\nseem obscure: Higden interpolates Malmesbury, as assigning its first\r\ngrant to Ina: Henry of Huntingdon says, Offa. This grant is supposed\r\nby Spelman to have been made in a General Council of the nation. A\r\nsimilar payment appears to have been made by other nations. It is to be\r\nobserved that Asser mentions only Ethelwulf’s donation of three hundred\r\nmancuses.\r\n\r\n[124] Asser relates that pope Leo stood sponsor for, and confirmed\r\nAlfred, who had been sent to Rome by his father the preceding year.\r\n\r\n[125] The conflagration here named seems that mentioned by Anastasius,\r\nwho tells us, that, shortly after the accession of Pope Leo the\r\nfourth, a fire broke out in the Saxon street, but the pope, making\r\nthe sign of the cross with his fingers, put a stop to it. (Anastas.\r\nBiblioth. p. 319.) From this author’s account it appears to have been\r\na street or quarter of considerable extent, and near to St. Peter’s.\r\nThere were schools of this kind belonging to various nations at Rome.\r\nMatt. Westminster says it was founded by Ina, with the consent and\r\napprobation of Pope Gregory, that priests, nobles, prelates, or kings,\r\nof the English nation, might be entertained there during their stay\r\nfor the purpose of being thoroughly instructed in the Catholic faith;\r\nfor that, from the time of Augustine, the doctrine and schools of the\r\nEnglish had been interdicted by the popes on account of the various\r\nheresies which had sprung up among them; that, moreover, Ina bestowed a\r\npenny from each house, or Rome-scot, for the support of these persons.\r\n(Matt. West. A.D. 727.) It was destroyed by fire in the year 816, and\r\npartially again A.D. 854. Our text, therefore, is at variance with the\r\naccount given by Anastasius, and the latter is probably incorrect.\r\n\r\n[126] The divisions of France were liable to considerable variation:\r\nbut it may be sufficient to observe, that Aquitaine lay between the\r\nGaronne and Loire; Vasconia, from the Garonne to the Pyrenees; Gothia,\r\nfrom the Pyrenees along the coast to the eastward; Austrasia or East\r\nFrance, besides various tracts beyond the Rhine, lay between that river\r\nand the Meuse; Neustria or West France, from the Channel to the Loire\r\nwith the exception of Brittany.\r\n\r\n[127] The battle of Fontenai is considered as the most calamitous in\r\nthe French annals; more than one hundred thousand men having, it is\r\nsaid, perished in it. It was fought on the 25th of June, A.D. 841, a\r\nmemorable month in the annals of France.\r\n\r\n[128] Cornu-guallia, i.e. the Horn of Gaul from the projection of\r\nBrittany.\r\n\r\n[129] Some pretend that he was accidentally wounded by Bertholde, one\r\nof his attendants; and that the story of the boar was invented in order\r\nto screen him from punishment. Malmesbury, however, follows Asser, the\r\nSaxon Chron., &c.\r\n\r\n[130] This vision is copied from Hariulfe’s Chronicle, lib. iii. cap.\r\n21. The Annals ascribed to Asser also recite the vision, sub anno\r\n886.--_See Mr. Hardy’s Note_, vol. i. p. 160.\r\n\r\n[131] Asser had conversed with many persons who afterwards saw her\r\nbegging for a subsistence in Pavia, where she died.\r\n\r\n[132] One hundred were for the pope, and the other two hundred to be\r\ndivided between the churches of St. Peter and St. Paul, to provide\r\nlights on Easter-eve.\r\n\r\n[133] Ingulf, who likewise gives this charter, reads, “laicis miseris,”\r\nthe poor laity.\r\n\r\n[134] Manse implies generally a dwelling and a certain quantity of land\r\nannexed; sometimes it is synonymous with a hide, or plough-land.\r\n\r\n[135] Ingulf has A.D. 855: 3 indict, which agrees with Asser, who\r\nassigns that year for the grant. It appears to be the charter which\r\nMalmesbury before referred to on the king’s going to Rome, and has\r\ngiven rise to much controversy; some holding that it conveyed the\r\ntithes of the land only, while others maintain that it was an actual\r\ntransfer of the tenth part of all lands in the kingdom. See Carte, vol.\r\ni. 293. Both opinions are attended with considerable difficulties. Mr.\r\nCarte very inadvertently imagines this charter and the copy in Ingulf\r\nto be distinct grants: the latter being, he says, a confirmation and\r\nextension of the former, after Ethelwulf’s return from Rome: but the\r\nfalse date in Malmesbury is of no importance, some MSS. having even\r\n814, and 855 was the year of his departure, not of his return.\r\n\r\n[136] Jordanes, or Jornandes, was secretary to the kings of the Goths\r\nin Italy. He was afterwards bishop of Ravenna, and wrote, _De Rebus\r\nGothicis_; and also, _De Regnorum et Temporum Successione_.--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[137] A similar list of the genealogy of the West Saxon kings, will be\r\nfound in the Saxon Chronicle, A.D. 855.\r\n\r\n[138] Malmesbury’s Chronology to the accession of Edward the Elder,\r\nis a year later than the Saxon Chronicle, Asser, and Florence of\r\nWorcester. His computation rests on fixing the death of Ethelwulf in\r\n857, who went to Rome in 855, stayed there a year, and died in the\r\nsecond year after his return. Allowing ten years for Ethelbald and\r\nEthelbert, it brings the accession of Ethelred to 867, and five years\r\nadded to this give 872 for Alfred’s accession. After the death of\r\nEthelbald Judith returned to France. She left no children; but marrying\r\nafterwards Baldwin, count of Flanders, she bore him Matilda, wife of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror.\r\n\r\n[139] Supposed Aston, near Wallingford, Berks. Others think Ashendon in\r\nBucks. The Latin and Saxon names, _Mons Fraxini_, and Eschendun, seem\r\nto favour the latter.\r\n\r\n[140] This legend will be found in the curious “account of the\r\ntranslation of the body of St. Cuthbert from Lindisfarne to Durham,”\r\nwhich we shall give in “Anglo-Saxon Letters, Biographies,” &c. It is\r\ntaken from the Acta Sanctorum, iii. March, p. 127.\r\n\r\n[141] This story rests upon the authority of Ingulf and William of\r\nMalmesbury. Asser does not notice it.\r\n\r\n[142] This seems a mistake as far relates to Northumbria. The\r\nSaxon Chronicle has “Northerna,” and Florence of Worcester “Rex\r\nNorthmanicus,” which at a first glance might easily be converted into\r\nNorthumbria.\r\n\r\n[143] Asser, the faithful friend and biographer of this great king. His\r\nLife of Alfred, alike honourable to his master and himself, is free\r\nfrom flattery. It is given in one of the volumes of our Series.\r\n\r\n[144] It has been printed by Gale, Oxon, 1681.\r\n\r\n[145] John the Scot is generally supposed to have died in France before\r\nA.D. 877, as the letter of Anastasius (Usher’s Sylloge, Ep. 24,)\r\naddressed to Charles the Bald, who died in that year, seems strongly\r\nto imply that he was not then living. There is, however, no positive\r\nnotice of the time of his death. The story indeed has so much the air\r\nof one told in Asser of John abbat of Athelney, that one would almost\r\nsuspect it was formed from it: especially as Malmesbury seems to speak\r\nin a very hesitating manner on the subject. V. Asser, à Wise, p. 62.\r\n\r\n[146] Asser says he first began his literary education, Nov. 11, 887.\r\n\r\n[147] Alfred’s Manual, from the description which Asser gives of it,\r\nappears to have contained psalms, prayers, texts of Scripture, etc.:\r\nMalmesbury, however, in his Lives of the Bishops, quotes anecdotes of\r\nAldhelm from it also.\r\n\r\n[148] Plegmund is said to have written part of the Saxon Chronicle;\r\nAsser was archbishop of St. David’s, and biographer of Alfred;\r\nGrimbald, abbat of St. Omers; and John of Corvey, a German Saxon, whom\r\nAlfred invited into England.\r\n\r\n[149] Asser says he devoted one half of his income “to God;” which part\r\nwas afterwards subdivided for the poor, for the two monasteries he had\r\nfounded, for the school he had established, for other monasteries and\r\nchurches, domestic and foreign.\r\n\r\n[150] This proportion was for both teachers and pupils in the school he\r\nfounded for the young nobility.--_Lappenberg_, vol. i. p. 340.\r\n\r\n[151] Matilda, queen of William the First, was daughter of Baldwin earl\r\nof Flanders, the fifth in descent from Ethelswitha. See note, p. 110.\r\n\r\n[152] On its removal called Hyde Abbey.\r\n\r\n[153] The popular notion was, that the devil re-animated the corpse,\r\nand played a variety of pranks by its agency; and that the only remedy\r\nwas to dig up and consume the body with fire. See Will. Neubrig v. 22.\r\n\r\n[154] Virg. Æneid, x. 641.\r\n\r\n[155] By West-Angles he probably intends the people of Essex or\r\nEast-Saxons. See Florence of Worcester.\r\n\r\n[156] Charles the Simple had one son by her, Louis II., surnamed\r\nD’Outremer.\r\n\r\n[157] Surnamed the Great: father of Hugh Capet: she had no issue by him.\r\n\r\n[158] Henry, surnamed the Fowler, father of Otho the Great. She had a\r\nson and daughter by him. One of Edward’s daughters, called Adela, is\r\nsaid to have been married to Ebles, earl of Poitiers, by whom she had\r\ntwo sons. See L’Art de Verifier les Dates, ii. 312.\r\n\r\n[159] This seems to have been Lewis the Blind, king of Arles: and if\r\nso, she must have been one of the elder daughters, as he appears not\r\nto have survived A.D. 930. She had, at least, one son by him, Charles\r\nConstantine, earl of Vienne. See L’Art de Verifier les Dates, ii. 429.\r\n\r\n[160] This is a mistake: Hugh is confounded with his father, who\r\nmarried Edward’s daughter. There is no notice of this exploit of Hugh’s\r\nin Bouquet, though Isembard is mentioned as the nephew of Lewis, who,\r\nbeing unjustly banished, returns accompanied by a large body of Danes\r\nand Normans, but is defeated. Bouquet, Recueil, &c. tom. ix. 58. Lewis,\r\nhowever, left issue, and it was on the death of his grandson Lewis,\r\nthat Hugh Capet became king of France.\r\n\r\n[161] This story of pope Formosus and the seven bishops is to be found\r\nverbatim in a MS. (Bodley, 579) which was given to the cathedral\r\nof Exeter by bishop Leofric, who died A.D. 1073. Its difficulties\r\ntherefore are not to be imputed to our author. But though it may\r\nnot be easy to assign a rational motive for the invention of such\r\nan instrument, it is a decided forgery; and all the ecclesiastical\r\nwriters, from Baronius to Wilkins, [See Concilia, i. p. 201,] have\r\nutterly failed in their conjectural attempts to uphold it: even the\r\ntemperate, the acute, the learned Henry Wharton [Anglia Sacra, i. 554,\r\n5], who rejects decidedly the epistle, gives but an unsatisfactory\r\nsolution of the seven vacant sees. Its repugnancies will be seen at a\r\nglance, when it is recollected, that Formosus died A.D. 896; Edward\r\ndid not reign till A.D. 901; and Frithstan did not become bishop of\r\nWinchester before A.D. 910.\r\n\r\n[162] Matt. ix. 37.\r\n\r\n[163] In the Saxon Chronicle it is called Brumby. [See Chronicles of\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons, in Bohn’s Antiquarian Library, pp. 376, 377.] Its\r\nsite is not exactly known, but it was probably not far from the Humber.\r\n\r\n[164] Said to be Werstan, bishop of Sherborne. See Malmesbury’s Gesta\r\nPontificum; or, Lives of the Bishops, to be hereafter translated and\r\npublished in this series.\r\n\r\n[165] This passage is thought to prove the existence of knights as\r\na distinct order among the Saxons; and, coupled with the case of\r\nHereward, it has very much that air. See Mr. Turner’s Anglo-Saxons,\r\n4, 171, et inf. But perhaps in the present instance, it may amount\r\nto nothing more than bestowing his first arms on him. Lewis the\r\nDebonnaire received his arms, “ense accinctus est,” at thirteen years\r\nold.--Duchesne, t. ii. 289.\r\n\r\n[166] Cornu Galliæ, a fanciful etymology.\r\n\r\n[167] Improperly called king: it was Hugh the Great, father of Hugh\r\nCapet. Malmesbury was probably deceived by a blunder of Ingulf’s.\r\n\r\n[168] This is a mistake, she was daughter of Alfred. See chap. iv. p.\r\n117.\r\n\r\n[169] The legend of St. Longinus makes the centurion mentioned in the\r\nGospel, the person who pierced the side of our Lord; with many other\r\nfabulous additions. See Jac. a Voragine, Legenda Sanctorum.\r\n\r\n[170] The Theban legion refusing, in the Diocletian persecution, to\r\nbring the Christians to execution, were ordered to be decimated; and on\r\ntheir persisting in the same resolution at the instigation of Maurice,\r\nthe commander of the legion, they were, together with him, put to cruel\r\ndeaths. V. Acta Sanctor. 22 Sept.\r\n\r\n[171] He has, apparently, the oppressions of bishop Roger constantly\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n[172] Reginald was not the son of Gurmund, but of Guthferth, who was\r\ndriven out of Northumberland by Athelstan. See Saxon Chronicle, A.D.\r\n927-944.\r\n\r\n[173] The exact meaning of some of these terms is not easily\r\nattainable, but they are generally understood to imply--jurisdiction\r\nover the burgh, or town--hundred court--oaths and ordeals--thieves\r\ntaken within the jurisdiction--housebreakers--breach of peace--offences\r\ncommitted on the highways, or forestalling--tolls--warranty, or a right\r\nof reclaiming villains who had absconded. The charter therefore conveys\r\na right to hold various courts, and consequently to try, and receive\r\nall mulcts arising from the several offences enumerated, which being\r\ngenerally redeemable by fine, produced considerable sums; besides, what\r\nwas perhaps of more importance, exemption from the vexations of the\r\nking’s officers.\r\n\r\n[174] Duke is often used in charters, &c. as synonymous with earl.\r\n\r\n[175] In Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\n[176] See Will. Gemeticensis, lib. iii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[177] These were a woollen shirt and cowl. Will. Gemet. lib. iii. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[178] Edred is described by Bridferth as being constantly oppressed\r\nwith sickness; and of so weak a digestion, as to be unable to swallow\r\nmore than the juices of the food he had masticated, to the great\r\nannoyance of his guests. Vita Dunstani, Act. Sanct. 19 Maii.\r\n\r\n[179] A quibble on his name, as compounded of “hill” and “stone.”\r\n\r\n[180] Much variation prevails among the earliest writers concerning\r\nElfgiva. Bridferth (Act. Sanct. 19 Maii) says, there were two women,\r\nmother and daughter, familiar with Edwy. A contemporary of Bridferth\r\n(MS. Cott. Nero, E. I.) asserts, that he was married, but fell in love\r\nwith, and carried off, another woman. A MS. Saxon Chron. (Cott. Tib. b.\r\niv.) says, they were separated, as being of kin. Osberne, Edmer, and\r\nMalmesbury, in his Life of Dunstan (MS.), all repeat the story of the\r\ntwo women.\r\n\r\n[181] Dunstan, learning that he was dead, and that the devils were\r\nabout to carry off his soul in triumph by his prayers obtained his\r\nrelease. A curious colloquy between the abbat and the devils on the\r\nsubject, may be found in Osberne’s Life of Dunstan, Anglia Sacra, ii.\r\n108.\r\n\r\n[182] The Mercians had revolted, and chosen Edgar king.\r\n\r\n[183] Osberne’s Life of St. Dunstan is published in the Anglia Sacra,\r\nvol. ii.\r\n\r\n[184] Wulstan’s Life of Ethelwold is printed by Mabillon, and in the\r\nActa Sanctorum, Antwerp. Aug. tome i.\r\n\r\n[185] He erected another church at Worcester, in which he placed monks.\r\nThe canons finding the people desert them in order to obtain the favour\r\nof the new comers, by degrees took the monastic habit. See Malmesbury\r\nde Gest. Pontif. lib. iii.\r\n\r\n[186] Some MSS. omit from “Edgar of glorious memory, &c.” to “spoken of\r\nanother. The monastic order,” &c. in page 155, and insert the charter\r\nat length, together with what follows it, thus:\r\n\r\n“In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ: although the decrees of pontiffs\r\nand the decisions of priests are fixed by irrevocable bonds, like the\r\nfoundations of the mountains, yet, nevertheless, through the storms\r\nand tempests of secular matters, and the corruptions of reprobate men,\r\nthe institutions of the holy church of God are often convulsed and\r\nbroken. Wherefore I perceive that it will be advantageous to posterity\r\nthat I should confirm by writing what has been determined by wholesome\r\ncounsel and common consent. In consequence, it seems proper that the\r\nchurch of the most blessed mother of God, the eternal virgin Mary, of\r\nGlastonbury, inasmuch as it has always possessed the chief dignity in\r\nmy kingdom, should be honoured by us with some especial and unusual\r\nprivilege. Dunstan, therefore, and Oswald, archbishops of Canterbury\r\nand York, exhorting thereto, and Brithelm, bishop of Wells, and other\r\nbishops, abbats, and chiefs assenting and approving, I, Edgar, by\r\nthe grace of God, king of the English, and ruler and governor of the\r\nadjacent nations, in the name of the blessed Trinity, for the soul of\r\nmy father who reposes there, and of my predecessors, do by this present\r\nprivilege decree, appoint, and establish, that the aforesaid monastery\r\nand all its possessions shall remain free and exonerated from all\r\npayments to the Exchequer now and for ever: they shall have soc and\r\nsac, on stronde and on wude, on felde, on grithbrice, on burgbrice,\r\nhundredsetena, and mortheras, athas, and ordelas, ealle hordas bufan\r\neorthan, and beneothan: infangenetheof, utfangenetheof, flemenefertha,\r\nhamsocne, friderbrice, foresteal, toll and team, just as free and\r\npeaceably as I have in my kingdom: let the same liberty and power\r\nalso as I have in my own court, as well in forgiving as in punishing,\r\nand in every other matter, be possessed by the abbat and monks of\r\nthe aforesaid monastery within their court. And should the abbat, or\r\nany monk of that place, upon his journey, meet a thief going to the\r\ngallows, or to any other punishment of death, they shall have power of\r\nrescuing him from the impending danger throughout my kingdom. Moreover,\r\nI confirm and establish what has hitherto been scrupulously observed by\r\nall my predecessors, that the bishop of Wells and his ministers shall\r\nhave no power whatever over this monastery, or its parish-churches;\r\nthat is to say, Street, Miricling [Merlinge], Budecal, Shapwick, Sowy,\r\nor their chapels, or even over those contained in the islands, that is\r\nto say, Beokery, otherwise called Little Ireland, Godney, Martensia,\r\nPatheneberga, Adredseia, and Ferramere, except only when summoned by\r\nthe abbat for dedications or ordinations, nor shall they cite their\r\npriests to their synods or chapters, or to any of their courts, nor\r\nshall they suspend them from their holy office, or presume to exercise\r\nany right over them whatever. The abbat shall cause any bishop of the\r\nsame province he pleases to ordain his monks, and the clerks of the\r\naforesaid churches, according to the ancient custom of the church of\r\nGlastonbury, and the apostolical authority of archbishop Dunstan, and\r\nof all the bishops of my kingdom; but the dedications of the churches\r\nwe consign to the bishop of Wells, if he be required by the abbat. At\r\nEaster let him receive the chrism of sanctification, and the oil from\r\nthe bishop of Wells, according to custom, and distribute them to his\r\nbefore mentioned churches. This too I command above all other things:\r\non the curse of God, and by my authority, saving the right of the\r\nholy Roman church, and that of Canterbury, I inhibit all persons, of\r\nwhatever dignity, be they king, or bishop, or earl, or prince, or any\r\nof my dependants, from daring to enter the bounds of Glastonbury, or\r\nof the above named parishes, for the purpose of searching, seizing,\r\nholding courts, or doing any thing to the prejudice of the servants of\r\nGod there residing. The abbat and convent shall alone have power in\r\ncauses known and unknown, in small and in great, and in every thing\r\nas we have before related. And whosoever, upon any occasion, whatever\r\nbe his dignity, whatever his order, whatever his profession, shall\r\nattempt to pervert or nullify the pre-eminency of this my privilege by\r\nsacrilegious boldness, let him be aware that he must without a doubt\r\ngive account thereof, with fear and trembling, before a severe Judge,\r\nunless he first endeavour to make reparation by proper satisfaction.”\r\nThe charter of this privilege the aforesaid king Edgar confirmed by his\r\nown signature at London, in the twelfth year of his reign, with the\r\ncommon consent of his nobles; and in the same year, which was the 965th\r\nof our Lord’s incarnation, and the 14th of the indiction, pope John,\r\nin a general assembly, authorized it at Rome, and made all the men of\r\nchief dignity who presided at that council confirm it; and also, from\r\nmotives of paternal regard, sent a letter to the following effect to\r\nearl Alfric, who was then grievously persecuting the aforesaid church:--\r\n\r\n“Bishop John, servant of the servants of God, to Alfric the\r\ndistinguished earl, and our dearly beloved son in the Spirit, perpetual\r\nhealth and apostolical benediction. We have learned, from the report of\r\ncertain faithful people, that you commit many enormities against the\r\nchurch of the holy mother of God, called Mary of Glastonbury, which is\r\nacknowledged to belong solely to, and to be under the protection of,\r\nthe Roman Pontiff, from the earliest times; and that you have seized\r\nwith boundless rapacity upon its estates and possessions, and even\r\nthe churches of Brent and Pilton, which, by the gift of king Ina, it\r\nlegally possesses, together with other churches, that is to say, Sowy,\r\nMartine, Budecal, Shapwick, and that on account of your near residence\r\nyou are a continual enemy to its interests. It would, however, have\r\nbeen becoming, from your living so near, that by your assistance the\r\nholy church of God might have been much benefited and enriched; but,\r\nhorrible to say! it is impoverished by your hostility, and injured\r\nby your deeds of oppression; and since we doubt not that we, though\r\nunworthily, have received from St. Peter the apostle the care of all\r\nthe churches, and solicitude for all things; we therefore admonish your\r\naffection, to abstain from plundering it, for the love of the apostles\r\nPeter and Paul, and respect to us, invading none of its possessions,\r\nchurches, chapels, places, and estates; but if you persist, remember,\r\nthat by the authority of the chief of the apostles, committed unto\r\nus, you shall be excommunicated and banished from the company of the\r\nfaithful, subjected to a perpetual curse, and doomed to eternal fire\r\nwith the traitor Judas.”\r\n\r\n[187] Glastonbury is situated on land which was once an island formed\r\nby a stagnation of inland waters, in a low situation.\r\n\r\n[188] The twelfth of Edgar was 971.\r\n\r\n[189] Here is an omission, apparently, which may be supplied from the\r\nAng. Sac. ii. p. 33. “A piece of ground, to wit, of ten farms (or\r\nmanors), called Estotun,” &c. G. Malm. de Vita Adhelmi.\r\n\r\n[190] Edgar’s laws for the punishment of offenders were horribly\r\nsevere. The eyes were put out, nostrils slit, ears torn off, hands and\r\nfeet cut off, and, finally, after the scalp had been torn off, the\r\nmiserable wretches were left exposed to birds or beasts of prey.

See Flor. Wigorn., and the Saxon Chronicle, A.D.\r\n1004.\r\n\r\n[197] At Assingdon in Essex, A.D. 1016.\r\n\r\n[198] In several of the manuscripts there is an omission of several\r\nwords which has made nonsense of the whole paragraph. Its restoration\r\nis due to Mr. Hardy, in whose edition of William of Malmesbury it is\r\ngiven correctly from MS. authority.\r\n\r\n[199] That is, when he had attained that age when a man settles, or\r\nchooses his future line of conduct; or, to years of discretion. This\r\nPythagoras represented by the form of the letter Y, or the Greek\r\n_gamma_.\r\n\r\n[200] Hermenegild the eldest son of Leovigild. He was invested by\r\nhis father with the royal diadem and the principality of Bœtica, and\r\ncontracted an alliance with Ingundis, daughter of Sigebert, king\r\nof Austrasia. Ingundis was persecuted, and at length killed by her\r\nhusband’s mother, on account of her Catholic faith. Leander, archbishop\r\nof Seville, easily persuaded Hermenegild to resent the treatment of\r\nhis bride, and assisted him in an attempt to dethrone his father.\r\nHermenegild was taken and sentenced to death for his rebellion. The\r\ninflexible constancy, with which he refused to accept the Arian\r\ncommunion, from which he had been converted by Leander, as the price\r\nof his safety, procured for him the honour of being enrolled among the\r\nsaints of the Romish church.--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[201] Isidore was bishop of Seville in the sixth century.\r\n\r\n[202] An instrument for making celestial observations.

The authors of the Hist.

They also seem very\r\nmuch displeased with Malmesbury for relating these tales of their\r\ncountryman, and attribute them to cardinal Benno; but there is nothing\r\nof this kind in his work published by Goldastus, and in Brown’s\r\nFasciculus, t. i.\r\n\r\n[204] Ovid.

The\r\nmurder of the Danes took place on St. Brice’s day, A.D. 1002, and\r\naccordingly we find Sweyn infesting England in 1003 and the following\r\nyear (see Saxon Chronicle): but this his second arrival took place,\r\nA.D. 1013: so that the avenging the murder of his sister Gunhilda could\r\nhardly be the object of his present attack.\r\n\r\n[213] Matins were sometimes performed shortly after midnight.\r\n\r\n[214] It was customary to hold a chapter immediately after primes.\r\n\r\n[215] Sweyn died Feb. 3, A.D. 1014.\r\n\r\n[216] The monastery of St. Edmundbury.\r\n\r\n[217] He here considers Ledo to imply the spring tide; but others say\r\nit means the neap, and express the former by Malina.

Florence of Worcester.\r\n\r\n[228] St. Angelo in Calabria.\r\n\r\n[229] The several princes, through whose territories their passage lay,\r\nexacted large sums for permission to pass; apparently in the defiles of\r\nthe Alps.\r\n\r\n[230] A penny for every plough, that is, for as much land as a plough\r\ncould till, to be distributed to the poor: it was payable in fifteen\r\ndays from Easter.\r\n\r\n[231] Payable at Whitsuntide.\r\n\r\n[232] A certain quantity of corn. Though it also implies, occasionally,\r\nother kinds of offerings.\r\n\r\n[233] A forfeiture to the king, but varying according to the nature of\r\nthe offence.\r\n\r\n[234] This seems to be the meaning: he has probably in view the\r\npractice of the early princes of the Norman line, who swore to observe\r\nthe laws of king Edward.\r\n\r\n[235] Dean of Canterbury.\r\n\r\n[236] This appears merely intended to express that he received the pall\r\nfrom the pope. The two transactions are inverted; he went to Rome A.D.\r\n1021, and translated Elphege’s body A.D. 1023.\r\n\r\n[237] Augustine, bishop of Hippo.\r\n\r\n[238] He was bishop of Selsey, which see was afterwards removed to\r\nChichester.\r\n\r\n[239] The whole country round Glastonbury is flat and marshy, bearing\r\nevident marks of having formerly been covered by water.\r\n\r\n[240] “See the letter of Fulbert to king Canute (an. 1020 aut 1021.)\r\nNo. xliv., p. 466. tom. x.

In the year 1037, Harold was chosen to reign over\r\nall England, (Flor.

Wigorn.\r\n\r\n[244] The Saxon Chronicle says March 17: it also makes Hardecanute\r\narrive on the 18th of June.\r\n\r\n[245] The printed Saxon Chronicle has no mention of this transaction,\r\nbut there are two manuscripts which relate it. The story appears true\r\nin the main, but it is told with so much variety of time, place, &c.,\r\nthat it is difficult to ascertain its real circumstances. See MSS.\r\nCott. Tib. b. i. and iv.\r\n\r\n[246] It seems to mean a page, or personal attendant: some MSS. read\r\n“alumnus sturni;” apparently the keeper of her starling.

During the Decian\r\npersecution they retired to a cave, whence they despatched their\r\nattendant occasionally to purchase food for them.

See Saxon. Chron. p. 440.\r\n\r\n[288] What Malmesbury here relates is highly probable, from the\r\nshortness of the time which elapsed from William’s landing, to the\r\nbattle of Hastings,--only fifteen days. In this period, therefore, the\r\nintelligence was to be conveyed to York, and Harold’s march into Sussex\r\nto be completed; of course few could accompany him, but such as were\r\nmounted.\r\n\r\n[289] Will. Pictaviensis, to whom he seems here to allude, asserts that\r\nHarold had collected immense forces from all parts of England; and that\r\nDenmark had supplied him with auxiliaries also. But the circumstances\r\nmentioned in the preceding note show the absurdity of this statement.\r\n\r\n[290] “Robert’s expedition to Jerusalem was in 1035,” (Bouq. 14, 420.)\r\n\r\n[291] Ecclesiast. x. 16.\r\n\r\n[292] Geoffrey II., son of Foulques III., earl of Anjou, whom he\r\nsucceeded, A.D. 1040.\r\n\r\n[293] “He was the son of Hugh de Montgomery and Jemima his wife,\r\ndaughter of Turolf of Pont-Andomare, by Wora, sister of Gunnora,\r\ngreat-grandmother to the Conqueror. He led the centre of the army\r\nat the battle of Hastings, and was afterwards governor of Normandy.\r\nWilliam the Conqueror gave him the earldoms of Arundel and Shrewsbury.\r\nSee more of him in Sir H. Ellis’s Introduction to Domesday, vol. i. p.\r\n479.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[294] “For an account of the earls of Anjou consult the Gesta Consulum\r\nAndegavensium, auctore Monacho Benedictino Majoris Monasterii (apud\r\nAcherium, tom, iii.)”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[295] To carry a saddle was a punishment of extreme ignominy for\r\ncertain crimes. See another instance in W. Gemeticensis, Du Chesne,\r\np. 259, and Du Cange, in voce “Sella;” who very justly supposes the\r\ndisgrace to arise from the offender acknowledging himself a brute, and\r\nputting himself entirely in the power of the person he had offended.\r\n\r\n[296] “From this passage it is clear that Foulques IV. was still\r\nthe reigning earl of Anjou, which therefore proves that Malmesbury\r\nhad finished this work before 1129, in which year Geoffrey le Bel,\r\nbetter known as Geoffrey Plantagenet, son of Foulques, became earl of\r\nAnjou.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[297] Terent. Andr. iv. 1.\r\n\r\n[298] “These words seem to imply that the Great Council of the kingdom\r\nhad never agreed to any settlement of the crown on the duke; and\r\nwithout such sanction no oath made by Harold in favour of William would\r\nhave been binding.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[299] Some copies omit from “it is wonderful,” to “But,” and substitute\r\nas follows:-- ... “that in the course of a very few years, many, if not\r\nall, things were seen changed in either order. The former became, in\r\nsome respects, more dull but more liberal: the latter, more prudent in\r\nevery thing, but more penurious; yet both, in defending their country,\r\nvaliant in battle, provident in counsel; prepared to advance their own\r\nfortune, and to depress that of their enemies.”\r\n\r\n[300] This passage enables us to ascertain nearly the year in which\r\nWilliam of Malmesbury’s work was written.\r\n\r\n[301] “There are two places called St. Valeri; one in Picardy, situated\r\nat the mouth of the Somme, and formerly called Leugonaus; the other is\r\na large sea-port town, situated in Normandy, in the diocese of Rouen,\r\nand was formerly called S. Valeri les Plains, but now S. Valeri en\r\nCaux. It seems to be the former place to which Malmesbury here refers,\r\n‘In Pontivo apud S. Walericum in ancoris congrue stare fecit,’ writes\r\nWilliam of Jumièges.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[302] This was said in allusion to the feudal investiture, or formal\r\nact of taking possession of an estate by the delivery of certain\r\nsymbols. “This story, however, is rendered a little suspicious by these\r\nwords being in exact conformity with those of Cæsar, when he stumbled\r\nand fell at his landing in Africa, _Teneo te, Africa_. The silence of\r\nWilliam of Poitou, who was the duke’s chaplain, and with him at his\r\nlanding, makes the truth of it still more doubtful.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[303] “Whatever may have been the conqueror’s orders, to restrain his\r\narmy from plundering, it is conclusive, from the Domesday Survey, that\r\nthey were of no avail. The whole of the country, in the neighbourhood\r\nof Hastings, appears to have been laid waste. Sir Henry Ellis, in\r\nthe last edition of his General Introduction to Domesday, observes,\r\nthat the destruction occasioned by the conqueror’s army on its first\r\narrival, is apparent more particularly under Hollington, Bexhill,\r\n&c. The value of each manor is given as it stood in the reign of the\r\nconqueror; afterwards it is said, ‘vastatum fuit;’ and then follows\r\nthe value at the time of the survey. The situation of those manors\r\nevidently shows their devastated state to have been owing to the\r\narmy marching over it; and this clearly evinces another circumstance\r\nrelating to the invasion, which is, that William did not land his\r\narmy at one particular spot, at Bulwerhithe, or Hastings, as is\r\nsupposed,--but at all the several proper places for landing along the\r\ncoast, from Bexhill to Winchelsea.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[304] Lib. v. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[305] This is from W. Pictaviensis, who puts it in the mouth of the\r\nconqueror, but it is evidently false; for Godwin died A.D. 1053, Siward\r\nA.D. 1055, and in 1054 we find Edward the Confessor sending for his\r\nnephew from Hungary, to make him his successor in the kingdom, who,\r\naccordingly, arrives in A.D. 1057, and dies almost immediately after.\r\nHe could not, therefore, have made the settlement as here asserted.\r\n\r\n[306] As the armour of that time was of mail, this might easily happen.\r\n\r\n[307] What this was is not known; but it is supposed to have been\r\na ballad or romance, commemorating the heroic achievements of the\r\npretended nephew of Charlemagne.\r\n\r\n[308] “There seems to have been a fabulous story current during the\r\ntwelfth century, that Harold escaped from the battle of Hastings.\r\nGiraldus Cambrensis asserts, that it was believed Harold had fled from\r\nthe battle-field, pierced with many wounds, and with the loss of his\r\nleft eye; and that he ended his days piously and virtuously, as an\r\nanchorite, at Chester. Both Knighton and Brompton quote this story.\r\nW. Pictaviensis says, that William refused the body to his mother,\r\nwho offered its weight in gold for it, ordering it to be buried on\r\nthe sea-coast. In the Harleian MS. 3776, before referred to, Girth,\r\nHarold’s brother, is said to have escaped alive: he is represented, in\r\nhis interview with Henry II. to have spoken mysteriously respecting\r\nHarold, and to have declared that the body of that prince was not at\r\nWaltham. Sir H. Ellis, quoting this MS., justly observes, that the\r\nwhole was, probably, the fabrication of one of the secular canons, who\r\nwere ejected at the re-foundation of Waltham Abbey in 1177.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[309] Four manuscripts read _Exoniam_, and one, namely, that which\r\nwas used by Savile, read _Oxoniam_. But Matthew Paris also seems to\r\nhave read _Exoniam_, for such is the text of the two best MSS. of\r\nthat author. (Reg. 14, c. vii. and Cott. Nero, D. V.) Upon a passage\r\nin the Domesday Survey, describing Oxford as containing 478 houses,\r\nwhich were so desolated that they could not pay gold, Sir H. Ellis\r\nremarks: “The extraordinary number of houses specified as desolated at\r\nOxford, requires explanation. If the passage is correct, Matthew Paris\r\nprobably gives us the cause of it, under the year 1067, when William\r\nthe Conqueror subdued _Oxford_ in his way to York:--‘Eodem tempore rex\r\nWillielmus urbem Oxoniam sibi rebellem obsidione vallavit. Super cujus\r\nmurum quidam, stans, nudato inguine, sonitu partis inferioris auras\r\nturbavit, in contemptum videlicet Normannorum; unde Willielmus in iram\r\nconversus, civitatem levi negotio subjugavit.’ (Matt. P. ed. Watts,\r\nsub ann. 1067, p. 4.) The siege of Exeter in 1067 is also mentioned\r\nby Simeon of Durham, col. 197; Hoveden, col. 258; Ralph de Diceto,\r\ncol. 482; Flor. of Worces. fol. Franc. 1601, p. 635; and by Ordericus\r\nVitalis, p. 510.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[310] Domesday Book bears ample testimony to this statement; and that\r\nwhich closely follows, viz. that the resources of this once-flourishing\r\nprovince were cut off by fire, slaughter, and devastation; and\r\nthe ground, for more than sixty miles, totally uncultivated and\r\nunproductive, remains bare to the present day. The land, which had\r\nbelonged to Edwin and Morcar in Yorkshire, almost everywhere in\r\nthe Survey is stated to be _wasta_; and in Amunderness, after the\r\nenumeration of no fewer than sixty-two places, the possessions in\r\nwhich amounted to one hundred and seventy carucates, it is said,\r\n‘Omnes hæ villæ jacent ad Prestune, et tres ecclesiæ. Ex his 16 a\r\npaucis incoluntur, sed quot sint habitantes ignoratur. Reliqua sunt\r\nwasta.’ Moreover, _wasta_ is added to numerous places belonging to the\r\narchbishop of York, St. John of Beverley, the bishop of Durham, and\r\nto those lands which had belonged to Waltheof, Gospatric, Siward, and\r\nMerlesweyne!--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[311] Fordun has a story of Edgar’s being cleared from an accusation of\r\ntreason against W. Rufus, by one Godwin, in a duel; whose son, Robert,\r\nis afterwards described as one of Edgar’s adherents in Scotland. L. v.\r\nc. 27-34. “The Saxon Chronicle states, that in the year 1106, he was\r\none of the prisoners taken at the battle of Tinchebrai, in Normandy.\r\nEdgar is stated, by Dr. Sayers, in his Disquisitions, 8vo, 1808, p.\r\n296, upon the authority of the Spelman MSS., to have again visited\r\nScotland at a very advanced period of life, and died in that kingdom in\r\nthe year 1120. If this date can be relied upon, the passage above noted\r\nwould prove that Malmesbury had written this portion of his history\r\nbefore the close of that year.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[312] “Earl Waltheof, or Wallef, as he is always styled in Domesday\r\nBook, was, according to the Saxon Chronicle, beheaded at Winchester on\r\nthe 31st May, 1076. The Chronicle of Mailros and Florence of Worcester,\r\nhowever, assign this event to the preceding year.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[313] “Harold’s master of the horse.

Fitz-Osberne was only the father-in-law of Ralph de\r\nGuader.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[315] There is considerable difficulty in distinguishing exactly\r\nthe various meanings of the term “miles.” Sometimes it is, in its\r\nlegitimate sense, a soldier generally; sometimes it implies a horseman,\r\nand frequently it is to be taken in its modern acceptation for a\r\nknight; the latter appears to be the meaning here.\r\n\r\n[316] “Charles, called the Good. He was the son of Canute IV, king of\r\nDenmark, and Adele, daughter of Robert le Frison. He succeeded Boudouin\r\nVII, as earl of Flanders (17th June, 1119,) and died 2nd March,\r\n1127.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[317] “King William now went over sea, and led his army to Brittany,\r\nand beset the castle of Dol; but the Bretons defended it, until the\r\nking came from France; whereupon king William departed thence, having\r\nlost there both men and horses, and many of his treasures, (Sax. Chron.\r\nA.D. 1076.) This event is more correctly attributed by Florence and\r\nothers to the preceding year.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[318] Domesday book. This invaluable record, which has been printed\r\nby order of the House of Commons, contains a survey of the kingdom,\r\nnoting, generally, for there are some variations in different counties,\r\nthe proprietors and value of lands, both at the time of the survey\r\nand during the reign of Edward the Confessor, the quantity of arable,\r\nwood, and pasture, &c. the various kinds of tenants and slaves on each\r\nestate, and, in some instances, the stock; also the number of hides\r\nat which it was rated, for the public service, with various other\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n[319] Sweyn succeeded to the kingdom of Denmark on the death of Magnus\r\nin 1047.\r\n\r\n[320] Man and Anglesey.\r\n\r\n[321] Nicolas reigned from A.D. 1105 to A.D. 1135, June 25, when he was\r\nmurdered.\r\n\r\n[322] “Hoveden, who follows Malmesbury, adds that Alexius married,\r\ncrowned, and then burnt alive his female accomplice.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[323] Archdeacon, and afterwards chancellor.

Sometimes excommunicated persons wore a halter about their necks;\r\nsometimes they were shorn or scourged prior to receiving absolution.\r\nVide Basnage, pref. in Canisium, p. 69, 70.\r\n\r\n[327] “The abbey of St. Stephen’s, Caen, is stated to have been\r\ncompleted in 1064, but when it was dedicated is not accurately known:\r\nsome fix the dedication in 1073, others in 1081, and Orderic in 1077.\r\nThere was, however, a foundation charter granted subsequently to 1066,\r\nfor in it William styles himself King.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[328] “The convent of the Holy Trinity was founded by Matilda 1066, and\r\nits church dedicated on the 18th of June in that year. Duke William\r\non the same day, presenting at the altar his infant daughter Cecilia,\r\ndevoted her to the service of God in this monastery, where she became\r\nthe second abbess.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[329] “This disgraceful contention happened in the year 1083. It seems\r\nto have arisen from the abbat (Thurstan) attempting to introduce a new\r\nchant, brought from Feschamp, instead of the Gregorian, to which the\r\nmonks had been accustomed.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[330] Bracton says (lib. ii. c. 8, sec. 4), that the bishop of Durham\r\nhad as full power in the county of Durham as the king in his own\r\npalace.

Here, too, many accidents befell the royal race, which\r\nthe recent recollection of the inhabitants supplies to inquirers.”\r\n\r\n[334] Agatha and Adeliza were their names, according to Ordericus\r\nVitalis, (lib. iv. 512.)\r\n\r\n[335] Some MSS. omit from “money,” to “I have,” and substitute, This he\r\nsought all opportunities of collecting, provided he could allege that\r\nthey were honourable, and not unbecoming the royal dignity.

When they were unable to consume whatever they found in\r\ntheir lodgings, they would sell it to the best bidder, or destroy it\r\nwith fire; or if it were liquor, after washing their horses’ legs with\r\na part, they let the remainder run. “As to their cruelty towards their\r\nhosts, or their unseemly conduct towards their wives and daughters, it\r\nis shameful even to remember.”--Edmer.

His father immediately\r\nflew to the king, earnestly entreating an order for his son to be\r\nrestored to the faith of his ancestors. The king not discovering any\r\nadvantage as likely to accrue to himself, remained silent: on this the\r\nJew offers him sixty marks, on condition that he would restore his\r\nson to Judaism. William then orders the youth to be brought before\r\nhim; relates his father’s complaint, and commands him to renounce his\r\nbaptism. The lad, astonished, replies, “Your majesty is joking surely.”\r\n“I joke with thee,” exclaims the king, “thou son of ordure! begone,\r\nand obey my commands instantly, or by the cross at Lucca I will have\r\nyour eyes torn out.” The young man remaining inflexible, he drove him\r\nfrom his presence. The father was then ordered before the king, who\r\ndesired him to pay down the money he had promised; but, on the Jew’s\r\nremonstrating that he had not reconverted his son, and the king’s\r\ndeclaring that his labour was not to go unrewarded, it was agreed that\r\nhe should receive half the sum.

See Du Cange: and Robertson’s Charles V. vol. i. It was blamed\r\nby some bishops as furnishing an occasion of perjury, and was rejected\r\nby the Normans, as contrary to their privileges. The Truce of God was\r\nfirst established in Aquitaine, 1032.\r\n\r\n[377] There are other orations, said to have been delivered by Urban\r\nin this council, remaining; and L’Abbe (Concil.

The cloister was a useful seminary\r\nto teach the plodding accuracy which is required to write a chronicle;\r\nbut for elevation of mind and diffusion of liberal sentiment, it was as\r\ninefficient as it is still.\r\n\r\n[380] The rustic, observes Guibert, shod his oxen like horses, and\r\nplaced his whole family on a cart; where it was amusing to hear the\r\nchildren, on the approach to any large town or castle, inquiring, if\r\nthat were Jerusalem.

Hist. Hierosol. ap. Du\r\nChesne, tom. iv. 845. This practice of swallowing money is referred to\r\nby pope Urban, and, by his account, the merely burning dead bodies to\r\nobtain the hoard was a very humble imitation of the Saracen custom,\r\nwith respect to those who visited Jerusalem before the crusades; which\r\nwas to put scammony in their drink to make them vomit, and if this did\r\nnot produce the desired effect, they proceeded to immediate incision!\r\nGuibert Abbas.

His first wife, an English woman, accompanied him on\r\nthe Crusade, and died in Asia: the second, daughter of Taphnuz, an\r\nArmenian nobleman, following him, by sea, to Jerusalem, was taken by\r\npirates; and being suspected of improper conduct during her absence,\r\nwas, on her arrival at Jerusalem, about A.D. 1105, repudiated, and\r\nshut up in the convent of St. Anne.

On its being seized Gozelin\r\nescaped, and collected troops to liberate his friends, who were now\r\nthemselves besieged.

In other words, the reading in the text was substituted by the\r\nauthor, when he revised his work after Robert’s death, for the reading\r\nin the note, which is copied from a MS. written whilst Robert was still\r\nin prison.\r\n\r\n[462] “Henry was born in 1068, not in 1070, as stated by Ordericus\r\nVitalis, (Annal.

See Anselmi Opera, edit. nov. p. 382, col. 2.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[471] Orderic. Vital. [p. 815.] relates a circumstance highly\r\nindicative of the troubled state of Normandy. Henry, on his arrival,\r\nwas immediately welcomed by Serlo bishop of Sees; who, on conducting\r\nhim into the church, pointed out the area nearly filled with boxes\r\nand packages brought thither for security from plunderers, by the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n[472] His daughter Mabil became the wife of Robert earl of Gloucester,\r\nto whom Malmesbury dedicated this work.\r\n\r\n[473] Robert de Belesme was seized by order of king Henry in 1112,\r\nhaving come to him in Normandy as ambassador from the king of France to\r\ntreat of peace. Robert was in the following year sent over to England,\r\nand confined in Wareham Castle until his death.--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[474] “The laws of Henry I. have lately been reprinted in the ‘Ancient\r\nLaws and Institutes of England,’ under the able editorship of Mr.\r\nThorpe.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[475] “It appears from two charters, printed in Rymer’s Fœdera, vol.\r\ni. pp. 6, 7, that Henry agreed to pay a pension of four hundred marks,\r\nannually, to Robert, earl of Flanders, for the service of one thousand\r\nknights.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[476] “William, surnamed Clito [the Clito], son of Robert, duke of\r\nNormandy, and Sibilla de Conversano, succeeded to the earldom of\r\nFlanders upon the death of Charles le Bon, A.D. 1127.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[477] He probably intended a joke on the custom of ringing the bells to\r\nscare evil spirits.\r\n\r\n[478] “Ordericus Vitalis attributes this act to Odo, bishop of Bayeux;\r\nbut Pope Urban II., in his Epistle to Raynald, archbishop of Rheims,\r\nascribes it to Ursio, bishop of Senlis.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[479] “Although king Philip, a few years before his death, entertained\r\nsome notion of embracing a monastic life, as is seen in the epistle\r\nwritten to him by Hugh, abbat of Cluni, yet it appears that he never\r\ncarried his design into effect.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[480] “Pope Calixtus met king Henry at Gisors on his return from the\r\ncouncil at Rheims, held in October 1119.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[481] This practice is referred to by Henry Huntingdon, when speaking\r\nof Hardecanute, who had four repasts served up every day, “when in our\r\ntimes, through avarice, or as they pretend through disgust, the great\r\nset but one meal a day before their dependents.”--H. Hunt. lib. vi. p.\r\n209.\r\n\r\n[482] “Henry of Huntingdon, in his epistle to Walter (Anglia Sacra,\r\npars ii., p. 695) gives a flattering character of Robert. Ordericus\r\nVitalis places his death on the first June, A.D. 1118.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[483] Roger had a church in the neighbourhood of Caen, at the time\r\nthat Henry was serving under his brother William. Passing that way,\r\nhe entered in, and requested the priest to say mass. Roger began\r\nimmediately, and got through his task so quickly that the prince’s\r\nattendants unanimously declared, “no man so fit for chaplain to men\r\nof their profession.” And when the royal youth said, “Follow me,” he\r\nadhered as closely to him, as Peter did to his heavenly Lord uttering\r\na similar command; for Peter, leaving his vessel, followed the King\r\nof kings; he, leaving his church, followed the prince, and appointed\r\nchaplain to himself and his troops, became “a blind guide to the\r\nblind.” Vide G. Neubrig, 1. 6.\r\n\r\n[484] “Paulus Diaconus, also called Winfrid, was secretary to\r\nDesiderius, last of the native princes of Lombardy. Paulus wrote his\r\nHistory of the Lombards, in six books, before the empire by Charlemagne\r\nwas founded.”--HARDY. Malmesbury seems to imply that the vessel was\r\nlost in the Mediterranean; but if so, he misunderstood Paulus Diaconus,\r\nwho is speaking of the race of Alderney. Vide Paul. Diac. lib. i. c. 6,\r\nap. Muratori. Rer. Ital. Script. t. 1.\r\n\r\n[485] Of Henry’s prudent accommodation to the times, a curious anecdote\r\nis related by Ordericus Vitalis, p. 815. When Serlo bishop of Sees\r\nmet him on his arrival in Normandy, he made a long harangue on the\r\nenormities of the times, one of which was the bushyness of men’s\r\nbeards which resembled Saracens’ rather than Christians’, and which\r\nhe supposes they would not clip lest the stumps should prick their\r\nmistresses’ faces; another was their long locks. Henry immediately, to\r\nshow his submission and repentance, submits his bushy honours to the\r\nbishop, who, taking a pair of shears from his trunk, trims his majesty\r\nand several of the principal nobility with his own hands.\r\n\r\n[486] Virg. Æn. vi. 853.\r\n\r\n[487] Whilst endeavouring to distinguish good coin from counterfeits,\r\nthe silver penny was frequently broken, and then refused. Henry’s\r\norder, therefore, that all should be broken, enabled any one\r\nimmediately to ascertain the quality, and, at the same time, left no\r\npretext for refusing it on account of its being broken money.--Vide\r\nEdmerum Hist. Novor. p. 94.\r\n\r\n[488] Suger relates, that Henry was so terrified by a conspiracy among\r\nhis chamberlains, that he frequently changed his bed, increased his\r\nguards, and caused a shield and a sword to be constantly placed near\r\nhim at night: and that the person here mentioned, who had been favoured\r\nand promoted in an especial manner by the king, was, on his detection,\r\nmercifully adjudged to lose only his eyes and his manhood, when he\r\njustly deserved hanging.--De Vit. Lud. Grossi. Duchesne, iv. 308.\r\n\r\n[489] “Compare Malmesbury’s character of Henry in this particular with\r\nthat given of him by Henry of Huntingdon.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[490] The ceremony of giving possession of lands or offices, was, by\r\nthe feudal law, accompanied with the delivery of certain symbols. In\r\nconformity to this practice, princes conferred bishoprics and abbeys\r\nby the delivery of a crozier and a ring, which was called their\r\ninvestiture: and as consecration could not take place till after\r\ninvestiture, this, in fact, implied their appointment also. The popes\r\nat length finding how much such a practice tended to render the clergy\r\ndependent on the temporal power, inhibited their receiving investiture\r\nfrom laymen by the staff and ring, which were emblems of their\r\nspiritual office. The compromise of Henry with Paschal enacted, that\r\nin future the king would not confer bishoprics by the staff and ring;\r\nbut that the bishops should perform the ceremony of homage, in token of\r\nsubmission for their temporals: the election by these means, remaining,\r\nnominally, in the chapter, or monastery.\r\n\r\n[491] The printed copy, as well as such manuscripts as have been\r\nconsulted, read, “investituras consecrationum:” evidently wrong; the\r\ntrue reading, as appears from Edmer, p. 72, where the whole instrument\r\nis inserted, being “investituram vel consecrationem.”\r\n\r\n[492] On Anselm’s return, shortly after Henry’s accession, it was\r\nagreed that all matters should remain in abeyance, until both parties\r\nshould have sent messengers to the pope, for his decision on the\r\nsubject of investitures. See Edmer, p. 56.\r\n\r\n[493] He had been recalled on the king’s accession, but afterwards\r\nquitted the kingdom again.\r\n\r\n[494] “Henry married Adala, daughter of Godfrey, conte de Louvain, in\r\nFebruary, 1121.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[495] “Bromton (col. 1013, x.

Margaret was given to Malcolm by her\r\nbrother Edgar Atheling, while in exile in Scotland, A.D. 1067. See the\r\nSaxon Chronicle.\r\n\r\n[536] “Robert was created earl of Gloucester in the year 1119. On the\r\nPipe-roll, 31 Hen. I., this entry occurs: ‘Glœcecestrescire. Et comiti\r\nGlœc. xxii. numero pro parte sua comitatus.’”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[537] “The nuptials of Matilda with Geoffrey Plantagenet, afterwards\r\nearl of Anjou, were celebrated in the presence of her father, in Sept.\r\n1127.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[538] “Henry completed the twenty-eighth year of his reign the 4th of\r\nAugust, 1128; but the Saxon Chronicle places his return from Normandy\r\nduring the autumn of 1129.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[539] It is very remarkable what excessive pains were employed to\r\nprevail on the young men to part with their locks. In the council held\r\nat London by archbishop Anselm, A.D. 1102, it is enacted, that those\r\nwho had long hair should be cropped, so as to show part of the ear, and\r\nthe eyes. From the apparently strange manner in which this fashion is\r\ncoupled in Edmer, p. 81, one might be led to suspect, it was something\r\nmore than mere spleen which caused this enactment. See also Orderic.\r\nVitalis.\r\n\r\n[540] An allusion to his name, which signifies a lion.\r\n\r\n[541] Pope Innocent died A.D. 1143.\r\n\r\n[542] “Philippe, eldest son of Louis VI, was consecrated by command\r\nof his father on the 14th April, 1129; but meeting with an accidental\r\ndeath on the 13th October, 1131, the king, twelve days afterwards,\r\ncaused his second son, Louis, to be crowned at Rheims by the Roman\r\npontiff, Innocent II.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[543] Both the printed copy and the MSS., which have been consulted,\r\nread here tricesimo primo, ‘thirty-first,’ [1131]; but it should be the\r\nthirty-second, 1132.--See Hen. Hunt.\r\n\r\n[544] “Malmesbury seems to have committed two oversights here. Henry\r\nwent to Normandy for the last time on the third before the nones of\r\nAugust, (that is, third, instead of fifth), A.D. 1133. This is evident\r\nfrom the eclipse he mentions, which took place on that day, as well\r\nas from the testimony of the continuator of Florence of Worcester, a\r\ncontemporary Writer.”--SHARPE. “Although all the MSS. read ‘tricesimo\r\nsecundo,’ yet it is evident, from the context, that it should be\r\n‘tricesimo tertio;’ the completion of Henry’s thirty-third regnal year\r\nbeing on the 4th of August, 1133. This, and other passages show, that\r\nMalmesbury reckoned Henry’s reign to commence on the 5th of August, the\r\nday of his consecration, and not on the 2nd of that month, the day of\r\nhis brother’s death.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[545] “The eclipse of the sun took place on the 2nd of August, 1133, at\r\nmid-day.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[546] From what has been said above this should be two.\r\n\r\n[547] “Liberationes,” signifies, sometimes, what we now call liveries,\r\nthat is garments; sometimes money at stated periods, or, as we\r\nshould say, wages: it is here rendered in the latter sense, as being\r\ndistinct from “solidatæ,” pay or stipends. Perhaps it was intended\r\nto distinguish two orders of persons by this bequest; servants and\r\nsoldiers: otherwise it may mean garments and wages.\r\n\r\n[548] “The majority of contemporary writers state that Stephen’s\r\ncoronation took place on the 26th December.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[549] “The author of the Dialogus de Scaccario states that for some\r\ntime after the Norman conquest there was very little money in specie in\r\nthe realm, and that, until the reign of Henry the First, all rents and\r\nfarms due to the king were rendered in provisions and necessaries for\r\nhis household; but Henry I ordered the payments to be made in money:\r\nthey were consequently made ‘ad scalam,’ and ‘ad pensum;’ ‘in numero,’\r\nor by tale; and ‘per combustionem,’ or melting, which latter mode was\r\nadopted to prevent payment being made in debased money; hence perhaps\r\nit was that Henry’s money was of the best quality.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[550] The progress of some of Henry’s treasure is curious. Theobald,\r\nearl of Blois, gave many jewels, which had been bestowed on him by\r\nStephen, his brother, to certain abbeys, and these again sold them\r\nfor four hundred pounds to Suger, abbat of St. Denis. Henry, Suger\r\nobserves, used to have them set in most magnificent drinking vessels.\r\nSuger, ap. Duchesne, t. iv. p. 345.\r\n\r\n[551] Church-yards were, by the canons, privileged, so that persons in\r\nturbulent times conveyed their property thither for security.\r\n\r\n[552] It had been the practice to seize, to the king’s use, whatever\r\nproperty ecclesiastics left behind them. Henry of Huntingdon relates,\r\nthat on the death of Gilbert the Universal, bishop of London, who was\r\nremarkable for his avarice, all his effects, and among the rest, his\r\nboots crammed with gold and silver, were conveyed to the exchequer.\r\nAnglia Sacra, ii. 698. Sometimes, even what had been distributed on\r\na death-bed, was reclaimed for the king. Vide G. Neub. 3, 5. “This\r\npractice of seizing the property of ecclesiastics at their death seems\r\nsubsequently to have settled down into a claim on the part of the king\r\nof the cup and palfrey of a deceased bishop, prior, and abbat. See Rot.\r\nClaus. 39 Hen. III, m. 17, in dorso.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[553] It seems to have been a vexatious fine imposed on litigants\r\nwhen, in their pleadings, they varied from their declaration. Murder\r\nis sometimes taken in its present acceptation; sometimes it means a\r\ncertain fine levied on the inhabitants where murder had been committed.\r\n\r\n[554] Earls, till this time, had apparently been official; each having\r\ncharge of a county, and receiving certain emoluments therefrom: but\r\nthese created by Stephen, seem to have been often merely titulary, with\r\nendowments out of the demesnes of the crown. Rob. Montensis calls these\r\npersons Pseudo-Comites, imaginary earls, and observes that Stephen had\r\ncompletely impoverished the crown by his liberalities to them. Henry\r\nthe Second, however, on being firmly seated on the throne, recalled\r\ntheir grants of crown lands, and expelled them the kingdom.\r\n\r\n[555] The term “miles” is very ambiguous: sometimes it is a knight;\r\nsometimes a trooper; sometimes a soldier generally. In later times it\r\nsignified almost always a knight; but in Malmesbury, it seems mostly a\r\nhorseman, probably of the higher order.\r\n\r\n[556] “Roger, the chancellor of England, was the son of Roger, bishop\r\nof Salisbury, by Maud of Ramsbury, his concubine.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[557] The author of the “Gesta Stephani,” says, the king ordered both\r\nbishops to be kept without food, and threatened, moreover, to hang the\r\nson of bishop Roger. Gest. Stephani, 944. The continuator of Flor.\r\nWigorn. adds, that one was confined in the crib of an ox-lodge, the\r\nother in a vile hovel, A.D. 1138.\r\n\r\n[558] It has before been related that Stephen made many earls,\r\nwhere there had been none before: these seem the persons intended\r\nby Malmesbury in many places, when speaking of some of the king’s\r\nadherents.\r\n\r\n[559] It would seem from this passage that he had seen Livy in a more\r\ncomplete state than it exists at present.\r\n\r\n[560] Horat. Epist. i. 1, 100.\r\n\r\n[561] The meaning of vavassour is very various: here it seems to imply\r\nwhat we call a yeoman.\r\n\r\n[562] This he effected by means of scaling ladders, made of thongs of\r\nleather. Gest. Stephani, 951.\r\n\r\n[563] Several MSS., as well as the printed copy, read 1142, but one has\r\n1141, which is right.\r\n\r\n[564] “Ranulf, earl of Chester, and his uterine brother, William de\r\nRomare, were the sons of Lucia, countess of Lincoln.”--HARDY.\r\n\r\n[565] The joust signifies a contest between two persons on horseback,\r\nwith lances: each singled out his opponent.\r\n\r\n[566] That is, as appears after, to acknowledge her publicly as their\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\n[567] Marchio: this latterly signified marquis in the sense we now use\r\nit; but in Malmesbury’s time, and long after, it denoted a guardian of\r\nthe borders: hence the lords marchers on the confines of Scotland and\r\nWales; though it does not appear very clearly how this should apply to\r\nWallingford, unless it was his place of birth.\r\n\r\n[568] This seems an oversight: as he had before related, more than once\r\nthat Stephen preceded Robert in taking the oath to Matilda.\r\n\r\n[569] Virgil, Æn. i. 33.\r\n\r\n[570] The garrison having sallied out against him, he suddenly passed\r\na ford which was not generally known and, repelling the enemy, entered\r\nthe town with them. Gesta Regis Stephani, 958.\r\n\r\n[571] One of the MSS. omits from, “This circumstance,” to the end, and\r\nsubstitutes, ... “but these matters, with God’s permission, shall be\r\nmore largely treated in the following volume.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were silently corrected, except as noted\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nPunctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent when a\r\npredominant preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nMany names were spelled in more than one way; in most cases, all\r\nvariants have been retained here.\r\n\r\nThe spelling of non-English words was not checked.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.\r\n\r\nThe page headers of the original book contained a timeline. It is\r\nrepresented in this eBook by sidenotes, beginning with “[A.D. year]”,\r\nplaced between paragraphs nearby their originally-printed positions,\r\nand shaded in some versions of this eBook. Redundant headers have been\r\nomitted, some of the dates are not in sequence, and some headers were\r\nnot printed near the topics to which they refer.\r\n\r\nAll but three of the chapter headings used the abbreviation “CHAP.”, so\r\nthe three that were spelled out have been changed to abbreviations.\r\n\r\nThe Index entries were not checked for proper alphabetization or\r\ncorrect page references, but all of the “U” entries have been moved to\r\nprecede the “V” entries rather than to follow them.\r\n\r\nIn the Index, inconsistent usage of periods and semi-colons at\r\nthe ends of main and sub-entries has not been changed; occasional\r\nmis-capitalization following such punctuation has not been changed;\r\nspellings that differ from the ones on the referenced pages have not\r\nbeen changed.\r\n\r\nUnbalanced quotation marks in footnotes citing HARDY have been remedied.\r\n\r\nPage 19: “unluckly” was printed that way.\r\n\r\nPage 196: Shows “1017-1031” as the years of Canute’s reign, and also\r\nsays he “reigned twenty years”.\r\n\r\nPage 232: “to his day” appears to be a typographical error for “to this\r\nday”.\r\n\r\nPage 256: Text uses “Standford Brigge” and “Stanford-bridge”; Index\r\nuses “Standford Bridge” to refer to this page. All retained here.\r\n\r\nPage 462: The opening quotation mark before “A.D. 1112, the fifth of\r\nthe indiction,” has no obvious matching closing mark.\r\n\r\nPage 496: “none before, appropriating” was changed here from “none\r\nbefore, appropropriating”, which appears to be a typesetting error.",
