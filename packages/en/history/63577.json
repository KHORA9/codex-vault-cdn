In some of its\r\nphases and manifestations it has presented age-old provocations and, not\r\ninfrequently, problems that are still unresolved.\r\n\r\nAmong such problems are involved the faculty of physiological potency,\r\nthe urge to attract amorously, and, conversely, the problem of\r\npreventing such attraction in a designated instance, or of diverting it\r\nto another objective.\r\n\r\nThat, in brief, is the essence of the material means of effecting such a\r\nrealization. In its various mutations, its protean diversities, it is\r\nthe love-potion, the philtre, the mystic concoction that, once quaffed,\r\nwill instil love and passion and desire and lust, that will replenish\r\nerotic inadequacies, that will awaken the ancient _fons vitae_, the\r\nsymbol of animate being, the source, as the antique Hellenes sensed and\r\nexemplified, of all cosmic creation, of the totality of living\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nThe potion, then, is at least a hypothetically efficacious instrument\r\nfor securing and preserving the amorous interests of the desired object.\r\nIt also serves as an apotropaic device for diverting misplaced love, as\r\nthe agent sees it, and redirecting it to the proper and preferred\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\nThe actual means for the fulfilment of these erotic purposes vary with\r\nthe ages, with ethnic groups and demographic alignments, with legendary\r\nand folk traditions and mores, with the disparate levels of culture of a\r\nspecific region. They present variations and adaptations in\r\ncorrespondence with climatic and epichorial conditions. But they retain\r\nthe essentially common characteristic, the unchanging property, of\r\nattempting to shape and mould the amatory esurgences, in whatever\r\ndegree, and whether transitory or of more enduring permanence, by\r\nimpersonal, palpable, mechanistic and visual means.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed, as a _terminus a quo_, that the term philtre\r\nitself stems from the Greek _philtron_, a love-potion (from _philein_,\r\nto love, and _tron_, an instrumental suffix). It means, then, a\r\nlove-charm.\r\n\r\nThe term potion is derived immediately from the Latin _potio_, a\r\ndraught, whether of medicine or even of poison. The ultimate source is\r\nthe Greek _potos_, a drink. In a general sense, therefore, a love\r\nphiltre or potion is a concoction, usually liquid in form, but not\r\nnecessarily so, intended to produce or promote amatory sensibilities. In\r\na wide and comprehensive denotation, the philtre will include any object\r\nor charm or periapt that serves the same erotic purpose.\r\n\r\nThis present survey touches on the use of the potion in the course of\r\nthe centuries, in varying circumstances and disparate countries: on the\r\nfantastic factors that composed the final preparations; and on\r\nanecdotes, both apocryphal and authenticated, and episodes and\r\noccasional allusions that point up the treatment, its hazards, and even\r\nits humors.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the potions and similar concoctions and preparations of\r\nan amatory nature, a caveat must here be entered. All such philtres are\r\nconsidered in this book from an exclusively traditional, historical, and\r\nacademic viewpoint. They are not recommended in any instance for\r\npersonal use, as they may involve unpredictable or even catastrophic\r\neffects: in no sense, therefore, should such prescriptions be utilized\r\nfor empirical experimentation.\r\n\r\n                                                                  H.E.W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _LOVE POTIONS THROUGH THE AGES_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n                               ANTIQUITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn ancient Greece, the climatic conditions, the long unending summer\r\ndays, the broad spaciousness of the sea, wine-dark and loud-sounding, as\r\nHomer describes it, the secluded pools and fountains and glades, the\r\nremote valleys, the snowy mountain summits were all alive, to the\r\nHellenic perceptive and imaginative mind, with graceful nymphs and\r\nshaggy satyrs, with a multitude of anthropomorphic divinities, and with\r\nthe alluring pipes of Pan.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions it was not difficult to conceive human life as\r\ndominated by the cosmic creative force, and to do homage and obeisance\r\nto the great god Dionysus, divinity of the fruitful wine, protector of\r\nall procreative and generative functions.\r\n\r\nThe generative and sexual activities of the Greeks were, in general, so\r\nfreed from contrived restrictions, so much in harmony with their\r\ninstinctive and developed sensitivity to beauty of form, of movement, of\r\nrhythm, that artificial aids and inducements to amatory performance were\r\nfar less necessary than they are in a highly complex and competitive and\r\nin a sense exhausted contemporary social frame.\r\n\r\nHence we do not constantly hear of the _ad hoc_ use of philtres,\r\npotions, and analogous means of stimulation. Yet their existence is\r\nestablished, and in particular cases they were brought into effective\r\nuse. Xenocrates, a Greek physician of the first century A.D., as Pliny\r\nthe Elder records, advised drinking the sap of mallows as a love-potion.\r\nSuch a philtre, together with three mallow roots tied into a bunch,\r\nwould inflame the erotic passions of women.\r\n\r\nAgain, Dioscorides of Cilicia, in Asia Minor, an army physician who\r\nflourished in the first century A.D., produced a _Materia Medica_ that\r\ntreated drugs, remedies, ingredients in a rational, systematic manner.\r\nHis text became a standard work, used for centuries, in both the East\r\nand the West. He recommends the roots of boy-cabbage, soaked in fresh\r\ngoat’s milk. A good draught of this drink would be productive of intense\r\nexcitation of the sexual impulse.\r\n\r\nMany spices, plants, herbs that were described, either by the\r\nencyclopedists and historians or incidentally mentioned in dramatic\r\nliterature, in occasional poems, anecdotes or in epitomes of legends and\r\nfolklore, were of such obscurity and rarity that it is no longer\r\npossible to ascertain the corresponding modern equivalent. There was, as\r\nan instance, satyrion. It is frequently mentioned, both in Greek and\r\nRoman contexts. Actually unidentifiable botanically, it may have been\r\nanalogous to the orchis. In Greek and also Roman antiquity it was\r\nreputed to constitute a potent aphrodisiac, and is mentioned in an\r\naccepted and traditional sense by writers such as Petronius, who\r\ncasually alludes to it in the course of his _Satyricon_ as a common\r\nerotic aid.\r\n\r\nThe name satyrion is evidently associated with the Greek satyr, a wood\r\nspirit, partly goat-like, and partly human. Attendants to the rustic god\r\nPan, the satyrs were known as bestial and lustful creatures, symbolic of\r\nthe basic sexual passion of man.\r\n\r\nBotanically, satyrion is a plant with smooth leaves, red-tinted, and\r\nequipped with a two-fold root. The lower part of this root was credited\r\nanciently with promoting male conception, while the other part was\r\nconducive to female conception. In its modern counterpart, satyrion has\r\nbeen associated with the Iris florantina.\r\n\r\nThere is another variety of satyrion, called Serapias. This has\r\npear-shaped leaves and a tall elongated stem. Its root consists of two\r\ntubers that have the appearance of testes. Unquestionably, the\r\nassociation of the plant as an aphrodisiac derives from the orchidaceous\r\nconfiguration of the root.\r\n\r\nRemarkable properties were attributed to the root of satyrion. When it\r\nwas dissolved in goat’s milk, the erotic effect was so vigorous and\r\nurgent that, as the Greek philosopher Theophrastus asserts in his\r\n_Enquiry into Plants_, the potion produced, on a particular occasion,\r\nsome seventy consecutive coital performances.\r\n\r\nStill another species of satyrion was erithraicon. This plant had a\r\npeculiar virtue. The mere holding of it, or carrying it, in the hand,\r\noccasioned a lustful desire. This fact is attested by Pliny, in his\r\n_Natural History_, in Book 26, 96 and 98, as well as by Dioscorides in\r\nhis _Materia Medica_ 3. 134. When the libido became too intense, lettuce\r\nwas eaten to mitigate the effect, to allay the erotic provocation.\r\n\r\nGreek mythology abounds in references to satyrion as an efficacious\r\nstimulant. The prowess of Hercules, the lusty warrior, as the Roman\r\nPetronius, Arbiter Elegantiarum, calls him, is attested in an amatory\r\nsense by the story of his visit to a certain Thespius. Entertained\r\nlavishly as a guest, Hercules, fortified by satyrion, repaid the host’s\r\nentertainment by having intercourse with all fifty daughters of\r\nThespius.\r\n\r\nIn Roman times the effectiveness of the root in arousing erotic\r\nexcitation was common knowledge. Petronius, the voluptuary attached to\r\nthe court of the Emperor Nero and the author of the remarkable\r\npicaresque novel entitled the _Satyricon_, alludes to the matter. One of\r\nhis characters, describing the frenzied activities in a brothel,\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\nWe saw many persons of both sexes, at work in the cells, so much every\r\none of them seemed to have taken satyrion.\r\n\r\nIn a more general direction, important testimonies to manipulative and\r\nmechanistic means of arousing vigor are the references in Petronius,\r\nparticularly the episode involving Quartilla:\r\n\r\n    Quartilla came up to me to cure me of the ague, but finding her\r\n    self disappointed, flew off in a rage, and returning in a little\r\n    while, told us, there were certain persons unknown, had a design\r\n    upon us, and therefore commanded to remove us into a noble\r\n    palace.\r\n\r\n    Here all our courage fail’d us, and nothing but certain death\r\n    seem’d to appear before us.\r\n\r\n    When I began, “If, madam, you design to be more severe with us,\r\n    be yet so kind as to dispatch it quickly; for whate’er our\r\n    offence be, it is not so heinous that we ought to be rack’d to\r\n    death for it”: Upon which her woman, whose name was Psyche,\r\n    spread a coverlet on the floor. Sollicitavit inguina mea mille\r\n    iam mortibus frigida. Ascyltos muffled his head in his coat, as\r\n    having had a hint given him, how dangerous it was to take notice\r\n    of what did not concern him: In the mean time Psyche took off\r\n    her garters, and with one of them bound my feet, and with the\r\n    other my hands.\r\n\r\n    Thus fetter’d as I lay, “This, madam,” said I, “is not the way\r\n    to rid you of your ague.”\r\n\r\n    “I grant it,” answer’d Psyche, “but I have a Dose at hand will\r\n    infallibly do it” and therefore brought me a lusty bowl of\r\n    satyricon and so merrily ran over the wonderful effects of it,\r\n    that I had well-nigh suck’d it all off; but because Ascyltos had\r\n    slighted her courtship, she finding his back toward her, threw\r\n    the bottom of it on him.\r\n\r\n    Ascyltos perceiving the chat was at an end, “Am not I worthy,”\r\n    said he, “to get a sup?” And Psyche fearing my laughter might\r\n    discover her, clapped her hands, and told him, “Young man, I\r\n    made you an offer of it, but your friend here has drunk it all\r\n    out.”\r\n\r\n    “Is it so,” quoth Quartilla, smiling very agreeably, “and has\r\n    Encolpius gugg’d it all down?” At last also even Gito laught for\r\n    company, at what time the young wench flung her arms about his\r\n    neck, and meeting no resistance, half smother’d him with kisses.\r\n\r\nA peculiar situation in which erotic provocation or inducement to\r\npassion is conditioned by the concept of social prestige, or, in the\r\ncontemporary idiom, status, is exemplified in a later passage in\r\nPetronius’ _Satyricon_:\r\n\r\n    Going out full of these thoughts to divert my concern, I\r\n    resolv’d on a walk, but I had scarce got into a publick one,\r\n    e’re a pretty girl made up to me, and calling me Polyaemus, told\r\n    me her lady wou’d be proud of an opportunity to speak with me.\r\n\r\n    “You’re mistaken, sweet-heart,” return’d I, in a little heat,\r\n    “I’m but a servant, of another country too, and not worthy of so\r\n    great a favor.”\r\n\r\n    “No, sir,” said she, “I have commands to you; but because you\r\n    know what you can do, you’re proud; and if a lady wou’d receive\r\n    a favor from you, I see she must buy it: For to what end are all\r\n    those allurements, forsooth? the curl’d hair, the complexion\r\n    advanc’d by a wash, and the wanton roll of your eyes, the\r\n    study’d air of your gate? unless by shewing your parts, to\r\n    invite a purchaser? For my part I am neither a witch, nor a\r\n    conjurer, yet can guess at a man by his physiognomy. And when I\r\n    find a spark walking, I know his contemplation. To be short,\r\n    sir, if so be you are one of them that sell their ware, I’ll\r\n    procure you a merchant; but if you’re a courteous lender, confer\r\n    the benefit. As for your being a servant, and below, as you say,\r\n    such a favor, it increases the flames of her that’s dying for\r\n    you. ’Tis the wild extravagance of some women to be in love with\r\n    filth, nor can be rais’d to an appetite but by the charms,\r\n    forsooth of some slave or lacquy; some can be pleased with\r\n    nothing but the strutting of a prize-fighter with a hacktface,\r\n    and a red ribbon in his shirt: Or an actor betray’d to\r\n    prostitute himself on th’ stage, by the vanity of showing his\r\n    pretty shapes there; of this sort is my lady; who indeed,” added\r\n    she, “prefers the paultry lover of the upper gallery, with his\r\n    dirty face, and oaken staff, to all the fine gentlemen of the\r\n    boxes, with their patches, gunpowder-spots, and toothpickers.”\r\n\r\n    When pleas’d with the humor of her talk, “I beseech you, child,”\r\n    said I, “are you the she that’s so in love with my person?” Upon\r\n    which the maid fell into a fit of laughing.\r\n\r\n    “I wou’d not,” return’d she, “have you so extremely flatter\r\n    yourself. I never yet truckl’d to a waiter, nor will Venus allow\r\n    I shou’d imbrace a gibbet. You must address your self to ladies\r\n    that kiss the ensigns of slavery; be assur’d that I, though a\r\n    servant, have too fine a taste to converse with any below a\r\n    knight.” I was amaz’d at the relation of such unequal passions,\r\n    and thought it miraculous to find a servant, with the scornful\r\n    pride of a lady, and a lady with the humility of a servant.\r\n\r\nA still more elaborate scene concerns the techniques of recovering the\r\nfaculty of erotic consummation. Encolpius, the narrator of the\r\n_Satyricon_, is attached homosexually to the young Gito. He is in a\r\nstate of incapacity. At this juncture he receives a note from Circe, the\r\nmistress of the maid Chrysis, commenting on his inadequacy:\r\n\r\n    Chrysis enter’d my chamber, and gave me a billet from her\r\n    mistress, in which I found this written:\r\n\r\n    “Had I rais’d my expectation, I might deceiv’d complain; now I’m\r\n    obliged to your impotence, that has made me sensible how much\r\n    too long I have trifl’d with mistaken hopes of pleasure. Tell\r\n    me, sir, how you design to bestow your self, and whether you\r\n    dare rashly venture home on your own legs? for no physician ever\r\n    allow’d it cou’d be done without strength. Let me advise your\r\n    tender years to beware of a palsie: I never saw any body in such\r\n    danger before. On my conscience you are just going! and shou’d\r\n    the same rude chilliness seize your other parts, I might be\r\n    soon, alas! put upon the severe trial of weeping at your\r\n    funeral. But if you would not suspect me of not being sincere,\r\n    tho’ my resentment can’t equal the injury, yet I shall not envy\r\n    the cure of a weak unhappy wretch. If you wou’d recover your\r\n    strength, ask Gito, or rather not ask him for’t—I can assure a\r\n    return of your vigor if you cou’d sleep three nights alone: As\r\n    to myself I am not in the least apprehensive of appearing to\r\n    another less charming than I have to you. I am told neither my\r\n    glass nor report does flatter me. Farewell, if you can.”\r\n\r\nWhen Chrysis found I had read the reproach, “This is the custom, sir,”\r\nsaid she, “and chiefly of this city, where the women are skill’d in\r\nmagick-charms, enough to make the moon confess their power, therefore\r\nthe recovery of any useful instrument of love becomes their care; ’tis\r\nonly writing some soft tender things to my lady, and you make her happy\r\nin a kind return. For ’tis confest, since her disappointment, she has\r\nnot been her self.”\r\n\r\nI readily consented, and calling for paper, thus addrest myself:\r\n\r\n    “’Tis confest, madam, I have often sinned, for I’m not only a\r\n    man, but a very young one, yet never left the field so\r\n    dishonorably before. You have at your feet a confessing\r\n    criminal, that deserves whatever you inflict: I have cut a\r\n    throat, betray’d my country, committed sacrilege; if a\r\n    punishment for any of these will serve, I am ready to receive\r\n    sentence. If you fancy my death, I wait you with my sword; but\r\n    if a beating will content you, I fly naked to your arms. Only\r\n    remember, that ’twas not the workman, but his instruments that\r\n    fail’d: I was ready to engage, but wanted arms. Who rob’d me of\r\n    them I know not; perhaps my eager mind outrun my body; or while\r\n    with an unhappy haste I aim’d at all; I was cheated with\r\n    abortive joys. I only know I don’t know what I’ve done: You bid\r\n    me fear a palsie, as if the disease you’d do greater that has\r\n    already rob’d me of that, by which I shou’d have purchas’d you.\r\n    All I have to say for my self, is this, that I will certainly\r\n    pay with interest the arrears of love, if you allow me time to\r\n    repair my misfortune.”\r\n\r\nHaving sent back Chrysis with this answer, to encourage my jaded body,\r\nafter the bath and strengthening oyles had a little rais’d me, I apply’d\r\nmy self to strong meats, such as strong broths and eggs, using wine very\r\nmoderately; upon which to settle my self, I took a little walk, and\r\nreturning to my chamber, slept that night without Gito; so great was my\r\ncare to acquit my self honorably with my mistress, that I was afraid he\r\nmight have tempted my constancy, by tickling my side.\r\n\r\nThe next day rising without prejudice, either to my body or spirits, I\r\nwent, tho’ I fear’d the place was ominous, to the same walk, and\r\nexpected Chrysis to conduct me to her mistress; I had not been long\r\nthere, e’re she came to me, and with her a little old woman. After she\r\nhad saluted me, “What, my nice Sir Courtly,” said she, “does your\r\nstomach begin to come to you?”\r\n\r\nAt what time, the old woman, drawing from her bosom, a wreath of many\r\ncolors, bound my neck; and having mixed spittle and dust, she dipt her\r\nfinger in’t, and markt my forehead, whether I wou’d or not.\r\n\r\nWhen this part of the charm was over, she made me spit thrice, and as\r\noften prest to my bosom enchanted stones, that she had wrapt in purple;\r\nAdmotisque manibus temptare coepit inguinum vives. Dicto citius nervi\r\nparuerunt imperio manusque aniculae ingenti motu repleverunt. At ilia\r\ngaudio exsultans, “Vides,” inquit, “Chrysis mea, vides quod aliis\r\nleporem excitavi?”\r\n\r\n             Never despair; Priapus I invoke\r\n             To help the parts that make his altars smoke.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the old woman presented me to Chrysis; who was very glad she\r\nhad recover’d her mistress’s treasure; and therefore hastening to her,\r\nshe conducted me to a most pleasant retreat, deckt with all that nature\r\ncou’d produce to please the sight.\r\n\r\n          Where lofty plains o’re-spread a summer shade,\r\n          And well-trimm’d pines their shaking tops display’d,\r\n          Where Daphne ’midst the Cyprus crown’d her head.\r\n          Near these, a circling river gently flows,\r\n          And rolls the pebbles as it murmuring goes.\r\n          A place design’d for love, the nightingale\r\n          And other wing’d inhabitants can tell.\r\n          That on each bush salute the coming day,\r\n          And in their orgies sing its hours away.\r\n\r\nShe was in an undress, reclining on a flowry bank, and diverting her\r\nself with a myrtle branch; as soon as I appear’d, she blusht, as mindful\r\nof her disappointment: Chrysis, very prudently withdrew, and when we\r\nwere left together, I approacht the temptation; at what time she\r\nskreen’d my face with the myrtle, and as if there had been a wall\r\nbetween us, becoming more bold; “what, my chill’d spark,” began she,\r\n“have you brought all your self today?”\r\n\r\n“Do you ask, madam,” I return’d, “rather than try?” And throwing myself\r\nto her, that with open arms was eager to receive me, we last a little\r\nage away; when giving the signal to prepare for other joys, she drew me\r\nto a more close imbrace; and now, our murmuring kisses their sweet fury\r\ntell; now, our twining limbs, try’d each fold of love; now, lockt in\r\neach others arms, our bodies and our souls are join’d; but even here,\r\nalas! even amidst these sweet beginnings, a sudden chilliness prest upon\r\nmy joys, and made me leave ’em not compleat.\r\n\r\nCirce, enrag’d to be so affronted, had recourse to revenge, and calling\r\nthe grooms that belong’d to the house, made them give me a warming; nor\r\nwas she satisfi’d with this, but calling all the servant-wenches, and\r\nmeanest of the house, she made ’em spit upon me. I hid my head as well\r\nas I cou’d, and, without begging pardon, for I knew what I had deserv’d,\r\nam turn’d out of doors, with a large retinue of kicks and spittle:\r\nProselenos, the old woman was turn’d out too, and Chrysis beaten; and\r\nthe whole family wondering with themselves, enquir’d the cause of their\r\nlady’s disorder.\r\n\r\nI hid my bruises as well as I cou’d, lest my rival Eumolpus might sport\r\nwith my shame, or Gito be concern’d at it; therefore as the only way to\r\ndisguise my misfortune, I began to dissemble sickness, and having got in\r\nbed, to revenge my self of that part of me, that had been the cause of\r\nall my misfortunes; when taking hold of it,\r\n\r\n            With dreadful steel, the part I wou’d have lopt,\r\n            Thrice from my trembling hand the razor dropt.\r\n            Now, what I might before, I could not do,\r\n            For cold as ice the fearful thing withdrew;\r\n            And shrunk behind a wrinkled canopy,\r\n            Hiding his head from my revenge and me.\r\n            Thus, by his fear, I’m baulkt of my design,\r\n            When I in words more killing vent my spleen.\r\n\r\nAt what time, raising myself on the bed, in this or like manner, I\r\nreproacht the sullen impotent: With what face can you look up, thou\r\nshame of heaven and man? that can’st not be seriously mention’d. Have I\r\ndeserv’d from you, when rais’d within sight of heavens of joys, to be\r\nstruck down to the lowest hell? To have a scandal fixt on the very prime\r\nand vigor of my years, and to be reduc’d to the weakness of an old man?\r\nI beseech you, sir, give me an epitaph on my departed vigor; tho’ in a\r\ngreat heat I had thus said:\r\n\r\n              He still continu’d looking on the ground,\r\n              Nor more, at this had rais’d his guilty head\r\n              Than th’ drooping poppy on its tender stalk.\r\n\r\nNor when I had done, did I less repent of my ridiculous passion, and\r\nwith a conscious blush, began to think, how unaccountable it was, that\r\nforgetting all shame, I shou’d contend with that part of me, that all\r\nmen of sense, reckon not worth their thoughts. A little after, relapsing\r\nto my former humor: But what’s the crime, began I, if by a natural\r\ncomplaint I was eas’d of my grief? or how is it, that we blame our\r\nstomachs or bellies, when ’tis our heads, that are distemper’d? Did not\r\nUlysses beat his breast, as if that had disturb’d him? And don’t we see\r\nthe actors punish their eyes, as if they heard the tragic scene? Those\r\nthat have the gout in their legs, swear at them; Those that have it in\r\ntheir fingers, do so by them: Those that have sore eyes, are angry with\r\ntheir eyes.\r\n\r\n          Why do the strickt-liv’d Cato’s of the age,\r\n          At my familiar lines so gravely rage?\r\n          In measures loosely plain, blunt satyr flows,\r\n          And all the people so sincerely shows.\r\n          For whose a stranger to the joys of love?\r\n          Who, can’t the thoughts of such lost pleasures move?\r\n          Such Epicurus own’d the chiefest bliss,\r\n          And such fives the gods themselves possess.\r\n\r\nThere’s nothing more deceitful than a ridiculous opinion, nor more\r\nridiculous, than an affected gravity. After this, I call’d Gito to me;\r\nand “tell me,” said I, “but sincerely, whether Ascyltos, when he took\r\nyou from me, pursu’d the injury that night, or was chastly content to\r\nlye alone?” The boy with his finger at his eyes, took a solemn oath,\r\nthat he had no incivility offer’d him by Ascyltos.\r\n\r\nThis drove me to my wits end, nor did I well know what to say: For why,\r\nI consider’d, shou’d I think of the twice mischievous accident that\r\nlately befell me? At last, I did what I cou’d to recover my vigor: and\r\nwilling to invoke the assistance of the gods, I went out to pay my\r\ndevotions to Priapus, and as wretched as I was, did not despair, but\r\nkneeling at the entry of the chamber, thus beseecht the god:\r\n\r\n          Bacchus and Nymphs delight, O mighty God!\r\n          Whom Cynthia gave to rule the blooming wood.\r\n          Lesbos and verdant Thasos thee adore,\r\n          And Lydians, in loose flowing dress implore,\r\n          And raise devoted temples to thy power.\r\n          Thou Dryad’s joy, and Bacchus’s guardian, hear\r\n          My conscious prayer, with an attentive ear.\r\n          My hands with guiltless blood I never stain’d,\r\n          Or sacrilegiously the gods prophan’d.\r\n          To feeble me, restoring blessings send,\r\n          I did not thee, with my whole self offend.\r\n          Who sins thro’ weakness is less guilty thought,\r\n          Be pacify’d, and spare a venial fault.\r\n          On me, when smiling fate shall smiling gifts bestow,\r\n          I’ll not ungrateful to thy godhead go.\r\n          A destined goat shall on thy altar lye,\r\n          And the horn’d parent of my flock shall dye.\r\n          A sucking pig appease thy injur’d shrine,\r\n          And hallow’d bowls o’re-flow with generous wine.\r\n          Then thrice thy frantick votaries shall round\r\n          Thy temple dance, with youth and garlands crown’d,\r\n          In holy drunkenness thy orgies sound.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus at prayers, an old woman, with her hair about her eyes,\r\nand disfigur’d with a mournful habit, coming in, disturb’d my devotions;\r\nwhen taking hold of me, she drew all fear out of the entry; and “what\r\nhag,” said she, “has devour’d your manhood? Or what ominous carcase have\r\nyou stumbl’d over in your nightly walks? You have not acquitted your\r\nself above a boy; but faint, weak, and like a horse o’re-charg’d in a\r\nsteep, tyr’d have lost your toyl and sweat; nor content to sin alone,\r\nbut have unreveng’d against me, provokt the offended gods?”\r\n\r\nWhen leading me, obedient to all her commands, a second time to the cell\r\nof a neighboring priestess of Priapus, she threw me upon the bed, and\r\ntaking up a stick that fastened the door, reveng’d her self on me, that\r\nvery patiently receiv’d her fury: and at the first stroak, if the\r\nbreaking of the stick had not lessened its force, she might have broke\r\nmy head and arm.\r\n\r\nI groan’d, and hiding with my arm my head, in a flood of tears lean’d on\r\nthe pillow: Nor did she then, less troubled, sit on the bed, and began\r\nin a shrill voice, to blame her age, till the priestess came in upon us;\r\nand “what,” said she, “do you do in my chappel, as if some funeral had\r\nlately been, rather than a holy-day, in which, even the mournful are\r\nmerry?”\r\n\r\n“Alas, my Enothea!” said she, “this youth was born under an ill star;\r\nfor neither boy nor maid can raise him to a perfect appetite; you ne’re\r\nbeheld a more unhappy man: In his garden the weak willow, not the lusty\r\ncedar grows; in short, you may guess what he is, that cou’d rise unblest\r\nfrom Circe’s bed.”\r\n\r\nUpon this, Enothea fixt her self between us, and moving her head a\r\nwhile; “I,” said she, “am the only one that can give remedy for that\r\ndisease; and not to delay it, let him sleep with me to-night; and next\r\nmorning, examine how vigorous I shall have made him:\r\n\r\n            “All Nature’s work my magick powers obey,\r\n            The blooming earth shall wither and decay,\r\n            And when I please, agen be fresh and gay.\r\n            From rugged rocks, I make sweet waters flow,\r\n            And raging billows to me humbly bow.\r\n            With rivers, winds, when I command, obey,\r\n            And at my feet, their fans contracted lay,\r\n            Tygers and dragons too, my will obey,\r\n            But these are small, when of my magick verse,\r\n            Descending Cynthia does the power confess.\r\n            When my commands, make trembling Phoebus reign,\r\n            His fiery steeds, their journey back again.\r\n            Such power have charms, by whose prevailing aid\r\n            The fury of the raging bulls was laid.\r\n            The Heaven-born Circe, with her magic song,\r\n            Ulysses’s men, did unto monsters turn.\r\n            Proteus, with this assum’d, what shape he wou’d.\r\n            I, who this art so long have understood,\r\n            Can send proud Ida’s top into the main,\r\n            And make the billows bear it up again.”\r\n\r\nI shook with fear at such a romantick promise, and began more\r\nintensively to view the old woman; Upon which, she cry’d out, “O\r\nEnothea, be as good as your word”; when, carefully wiping her hands, she\r\nlay down on the bed, and half smother’d me with kisses.\r\n\r\nEnothea, in the middle of the altar, plac’d a turf-table, which she\r\nheapt with burning coals, and her old crack cup (for sacrifice) repair’d\r\nwith temper’d pitch; when she had fixt it to the smoaking-wall from\r\nwhich she took it; putting on her habit, she plac’d a kettle by the\r\nfire, and took down a bag that hung near her, in which, a bean was kept\r\nfor that use, and a very aged piece of a hog’s forehead, with the print\r\nof a hundred cuts out; when opening the bag, she threw me a part of the\r\nbean, and bid me carefully strip it. I obey her command, and try,\r\nwithout daubing my fingers, to deliver the grain from its nasty\r\ncoverings; but she, blaming my dullness, snatcht it from me, and\r\nskilfully tearing its shells with her teeth, spit the black morsels from\r\nher, that lay like dead flies on the ground. How ingenious is poverty,\r\nand what strange arts will hunger teach? The priestess seemed so great a\r\nlover of this sort of life, that her humor appear’d in every thing about\r\nher, and her hut might be truly term’d, sacred to poverty:\r\n\r\n         Here shines no glittering ivory set with gold,\r\n         No marble covers the deluded mold,\r\n         By its own wealth deluded; but the shrine\r\n         With simple natural ornaments does shine.\r\n         Round Cere’s bower, but homely willows grow.\r\n         Earthen are all the sacred bowls they know.\r\n         Osier the dish, sacred to use divine:\r\n         Both course and stain’d, the jug that holds the wine.\r\n         Mud mixt with straw, make a defending fort,\r\n         The temple’s brazen studs, are knobs of dirt.\r\n         With rush and reed, is thatcht the hut it self,\r\n         Where, besides what is on a smoaky shelf,\r\n         Ripe service-berries into garlands bound,\r\n         And savory-bunches with dry’d grapes are found.\r\n         Such a low cottage Hecale confin’d,\r\n         Low was her cottage, but sublime her mind.\r\n         Her bounteous heart, a grateful praise shall crown,\r\n         And muses make immortal her renown.\r\n\r\nAfter which, she tasted of the flesh, and hanging the rest, old as her\r\nself, on the hook again; the rotten stool on which she was mounted\r\nbreaking, threw her into the fire, her fall spilt the kettle, and what\r\nit held put out the fire; she burnt her elbow, and all her face was hid\r\nwith the ashes that her fall had rais’d.\r\n\r\nThus disturb’d, I arose, and laughing, took her up; immediately, lest\r\nany thing shou’d hinder the offering, she ran for new fire to the\r\nneighborhood, and had hardly got to the door, e’re I was set upon by\r\nthree sacred geese, that daily, I believe, about that time were fed by\r\nthe old woman; they made an hideous noise, and, surrounding me, one\r\ntears my coat, another my shoes, while their furious captain made\r\nnothing of doing so by my legs; till seeing my self in danger, I began\r\nto be in earnest, and snatching up one of the feet of our little table,\r\nmade the valiant animal feel my arm’d hand; nor content with a slight\r\nblow or two, but reveng’d my self with its death:\r\n\r\n            Such were the birds Alcides did subdue,\r\n            That from his conquering arm t’ward Heaven flew:\r\n            Such sure the harpyes were which poyson strow’d,\r\n            On cheated Phineus’s false deluding food.\r\n            Loud lamentations shake the trembling air,\r\n            The powers above the wild confusion share,\r\n            Horrors disturb the orders of the sky,\r\n            And frighted stars beyond their courses fly.\r\n\r\nBy this time the other two had eat up the pieces of the bean that lay\r\nscatter’d on the floor, and having lost their leader, return’d to the\r\ntemple. When glad of the booty and my revenge, I heal’d the slight old\r\nwoman’s anger, I design’d to make off; and taking up my cloaths, began\r\nmy march; nor had I reach’d the door, e’re I saw Enothea bringing in her\r\nhand an earthen pot fill’d with fire; upon which I retreated, and\r\nthrowing down my cloaths, fixt my self in the entry, as if I were\r\nimpatiently expecting her coming.\r\n\r\nEnothea, entring, plac’d the fire, that with broken sticks she had got\r\ntogether, and having heapt more wood upon those, began to excuse her\r\nstay, that her friend wou’d not let her go before she had, against the\r\nlaws of drinking, taken off three healths together. When looking about\r\nher, “What,” said she, “have you been doing in my absence? Where’s the\r\nbean?”\r\n\r\nI, who thought I had behav’d my self very honorably, told her the whole\r\nfight; and to end her grief for the loss of her bean, presented the\r\ngoose: when I shew’d the goose, the old woman set up such an outcry,\r\nthat you wou’d have thought the geese were re-entering the place.\r\n\r\nIn confusion and amaz’d at so strange a humor, I askt the meaning of her\r\npassion? or why she pity’d the goose rather than me.\r\n\r\nBut wringing her hands, “you wicked wretch,” said she, “d’ye speak too?\r\nD’ye know what you’ve done? You’ve killed the gods delight, a goose the\r\npleasure of all matrons: And, lest you shou’d think your self innocent,\r\nif a magistrate shou’d hear of it, you’d be hang’d. You have defil’d\r\nwith blood my cell, that to this day had been inviolate. You have done\r\nthat, for which, if any’s so malicious, he may expel me my office.”\r\n\r\n             She said, and trembling, rends her aged hairs,\r\n             And both her cheeks with wilder fury tears:\r\n             Sad murmurs from her troubl’d breast arise,\r\n             A shower of tears there issu’d from her eyes.\r\n             And down her face a rapid deluge run,\r\n             Such as is seen, when a hills frosty crown,\r\n             By warm Favonius is melted down.\r\n\r\nUpon which, “I beseech you,” said I, “don’t grieve, I’ll recompence the\r\nloss of your goose with an ostrich.”\r\n\r\nWhile amaz’d I spoke, she sat down on the bed, lamented her loss; at\r\nwhat time Proselenos came in with the sacrifice, and viewing the\r\nmurder’d goose, and enquiring the cause, began very earnestly to cry and\r\npity me, as it had been a father, not a goose I had slain. But tired\r\nwith this stuff, “I beseech you,” said I, “tell me, tho’ it had been a\r\nman I kill’d, won’t gold wipe off the guilt? See here are two pieces of\r\ngold: with these you may purchase gods as well as geese.”\r\n\r\nWhich, when Enothea beheld, “Pardon me, young man,” said she, “I am only\r\nconcern’d for your safety, which is an argument of love, not hatred;\r\ntherefore we’ll take what care we can to prevent a discovery: You have\r\nnothing to do, but intreat the gods to forgive the sin.”\r\n\r\n             Who e’re has money may securely sail,\r\n             On all things with all-mighty gold prevail.\r\n             May Danae wed, or rival amo’rous Jove,\r\n             And make her father pandar to his love.\r\n             May be a poet, preacher, lawyer, too:\r\n             And bawling win the cause he does not know:\r\n             And up to Cato’s fame for wisdom grow.\r\n             Wealth without law will gain at bar renown,\r\n             How e’re the case appears, the cause is won,\r\n             Every rich lawyer is a Littleton.\r\n             In short of all you wish you are possest,\r\n             All things prevent the wealthy mans’ request,\r\n             For Jove himself’s the treasure of his chest.\r\n\r\nWhile my thoughts were thus engag’d, she plac’d a cup of wine under my\r\nhands, and having cleans’d my prophane extended fingers with sacred\r\nleeks and parsley, threw into the wine, with some ejaculations,\r\nhazel-nuts, and as they sunk or swam gave her judgment; but I well knew\r\nthe empty rotten ones wou’d swim, and those of entire kernels go to the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nWhen applying herself to the goose, from its breast she drew a lusty\r\nliver, and then told me my future fortune. But that no mark of the\r\nmurder might be left, she fixt the rent goose to a spit, which, as she\r\nsaid, she had fatten’d a little before, as sensible it was to die.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the wine went briskly round, and now the old women\r\ngladly devour the goose, they so lately lamented; when they had pickt\r\nits bones, Enothea, half drunk, turn’d to me; “and now,” said she, “I’ll\r\nfinish the charm that recovers your strength”: When drawing out a\r\nleathern ensign of Priapus, she dipt it in a medley of oyl, small\r\npepper, and the bruis’d seed of nettles, paulatim coepit inserere ano\r\nmeo. Hoc crudelissima anus spurgit subinde umore femina mea. Nasturcii\r\nsucum cum abrotano miscet perfusisque inguinibus meis viridis urticae\r\nfascem comprehendit, omniaque infra umbilicum coepit lenta manu caedere.\r\nUpon which jumping from her, to avoid the sting, I made off. The old\r\nwoman in a great rage pursu’d me, and tho’ drunk with wine, and their\r\nmore hot desires, took the right way; and follow’d me through two or\r\nthree villages, crying stop thief; but with my hands all bloody, in the\r\nhasty flight, I got off.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  National Gallery of Art\r\n\r\n  THE KISS\r\n\r\n  _by Rodin_\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Metropolitan Museum of Art\r\n\r\n  BESIDE THE SEA\r\n\r\n  _by Rodin_\r\n]\r\n\r\nLove manifestations and the passion for promoting weakened or inadequate\r\nfunctional activity are familiar themes in the most remote areas of the\r\nworld. In the Arctic circle as well as in the Marshall Islands. Among\r\nthe Eskimo of uttermost Greenland and among the Jibaro Indians of\r\nEquador.

The natives of these disparate\r\nterritories are familiar with the plant and animal life of their\r\nregions, the nuts and fruits, the herbs and leaves, and their properties\r\nand specific virtues. They have tested them in food and drink, and in\r\nother functional directions: and by long, groping, deductive sequences\r\nthey have come to definite practical conclusions. They have managed to\r\nextract or to use certain essences and elements in these roots and\r\nplants that they found conducive to specific purposes, particularly to\r\nthe primary function of life, the erotic motif, the functional\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nOral traditions, the ways of the tribal society, derive,\r\npre-historically, from a matriarchal hierarchy.

Because they are the conditions of procreation, the\r\nsource of fertility, the depositories of life and continuity. The love\r\nmystique, then, is the primary and virtually exclusive sacrosanct\r\nknowledge confined to the female of the tribe. Hence, after the ages of\r\noral transmission, when we enter upon the centuries of writing, verbal\r\ntranscription, and recording, then the sagas and chronicles, the legends\r\nand folk consciousness, invariably dwell on the female, the wise old\r\nwoman, the witch, the adept, who possesses the arcana of erotic\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nIn the course of undetermined time, as literary mastery grows and\r\ndevelops culturally to the degree attained by Greece in the fifth\r\ncentury B.C., the witch, as guardian of Aphrodite’s mysteries, is\r\nparamount. She is known to the peasant and the hoplite, to the cobbler\r\nand the young athlete, to the stroller in the agora, to the serious\r\ndramatist, even to the philosophers, to Socrates, to Plato.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn classical legend, Phaon, a ferryman of Lesbos, was given a potent\r\nperiapt by Aphrodite, that made him remarkably handsome. The poetess\r\nSappho consequently fell passionately in love with him. According to the\r\nRoman encyclopedist Pliny the Elder, author of the _Historia Naturalis_,\r\nPhaon had found a mandrake root that resembled the male genitalia. This\r\nroot was an assurance of feminine love. Sappho, however, is said, in the\r\nversion of Ovid’s _Heroides_, to have flung herself from the Leucadian\r\nrock on his account.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nXenophon, the Greek historian who belongs in the fourth century B.C.,\r\nrecounts, in his _Memorabilia_, a dialogue between the philosopher\r\nSocrates and a hetaira named Theodote. The subject is the art of finding\r\nand retaining lovers.\r\n\r\n  Socrates: There are my lady friends, who will never let me leave them,\r\n      night or day. They would always be having me teach them\r\n      love-charms and incantations.\r\n\r\n  Theodote: Are you really acquainted with such things, Socrates?\r\n\r\n  Socrates: Of course I am. What else is the reason, think you, that\r\n      Apollodorus and Antisthenes never leave my side? Why have Cebes\r\n      and Simmias come all the way from Thebes to stay with me? You may\r\n      be quite sure that not without love-charms and incantations and\r\n      magic-wheels can this be brought about.\r\n\r\n  Theodote: Lend me your wheel, then, that I may use it on you.\r\n\r\n  Socrates: Nay, I do not want to be drawn to you. I want you to come to\r\n      me.\r\n\r\n  Theodote: Well, I will come. But be sure to be at home.\r\n\r\n  Socrates: I will be at home to you, unless there be some lady with me\r\n      who is dearer than yourself.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA speech attributed to the Greek orator Antiphon, who dates in the fifth\r\ncentury B.C., involves a belief that love could be secured by the\r\nadministration of a potion.\r\n\r\n    The Attic orator is addressing the court:\r\n\r\n    The girl began to consider how she should administer the potion\r\n    to them, before or after dinner, and, on reflection, she decided\r\n    it would be better to give it after the meal. I will endeavor to\r\n    give you a brief account of how the potion was actually\r\n    administered. The two friends partook of a good dinner, as you\r\n    can imagine, the host having a sacrifice to offer to the god of\r\n    his household and the guest being on the eve of a sea voyage.\r\n    When they had finished, they made a libation and added thereto\r\n    some grains of incense. But while they were murmuring their\r\n    prayer, the concubine slipped the poison into the wine she was\r\n    pouring out for them: and furthermore, thinking that she was\r\n    doing something clever, she gave Philoneos an extra dose,\r\n    supposing that the more she gave the warmer would be his love\r\n    for her.\r\n\r\nThe important deduction that follows as a corollary from the above\r\npassage is that the love-potion, mentioned without elaborate comment,\r\nwas already, in the fifth century B.C., a matter of common knowledge and\r\ncommon use.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe plant called anciently telephilon was used by the Greeks for amatory\r\npurposes. Botanically, it has been identified with the poppy: and by\r\nsome, with a kind of pepper tree. Theocritus, the Greek bucolic poet,\r\nrefers to its use in the third Idyll. A goatherd goes to the cave of his\r\nsweet-heart Amaryllis. He tries to re-awaken her former love:\r\n\r\n    I learned my fate but lately, when upon my bethinking me whether\r\n    you loved me, not even did the poppy leaf coming in contact make\r\n    a sound, but withered away just so upon my soft arm.\r\n\r\nLovers were accustomed to guess by the poppy leaf placed between\r\nforefinger and thumb of the left hand, and then struck by the right,\r\nwhether their love was reciprocated. If a loud crack was produced, it\r\nwas a propitious amatory omen.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient authorities the virtues of plants and herbs and spices\r\nand their medicinal curative powers and also their amatory impacts were\r\nfrequently enumerated, described, and classified. In this group belongs\r\nDioscorides, a Greek army surgeon who flourished in the first century\r\nA.D. His comprehensive treatise on the subject, _De Materia Medica Libri\r\nQuinque_, was for centuries consulted and used as a standard text. In\r\nthe Middle Ages the famous Portuguese Marrano physician Amatus Lusitanus\r\nproduced an excellent edition of Dioscorides. It was published, with\r\nnumerous woodcut illustrations, at Leyden in Holland, in 1558.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccording to the _Enquiry into Plants_ by Theophrastus, and equally to\r\nthe _Materia Medica_ of the Greek army surgeon Dioscorides, cyclamen,\r\nwhich is sowbread, had erotic properties. The root of the plant was used\r\nas an ingredient in love-potions.\r\n\r\nThe plant itself produces colorful flowers, while the fleshy roots are\r\nfavored by swine: hence the old name of sowbread.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Greek physician Dioscorides, who served as a surgeon in the army of\r\nthe Roman Emperor Nero, mentions, in his _Materia Medica_, mandrake as\r\nbeing anciently considered efficacious in love philtres. He also alludes\r\nto the practice in his own days, when a concoction of the root of\r\nmandrake steeped in wine was judged to be a favorable love-potion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the furious and unceasing search for some product of the earth, some\r\nfabricated distillation, some suddenly and miraculously discovered\r\ntriumphant panacea that would efficaciously induce virile activity, the\r\nancients grasped at any object that, by its mere outward and physical\r\nconformation, might conceivably have some cryptic, symbolic association\r\nwith genital resemblances, and hence with amatory functions.\r\n\r\nSuch a resemblance was readily and gratefully found in the mandrake. The\r\nmandrake, even in Biblical times, was credited with unique properties,\r\nnot least, with amatory stimulation.\r\n\r\nMandrake, or mandragore, which is botanically mandragora, mandragora\r\nofficinarum, is a tuber with purple flowers, dark-leaved. It is native\r\nto Palestine, and hence has a Hebrew name, mentioned in Biblical\r\nliterature. It is called there dudaim, an expression associated\r\netymologically with _love_.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of mandrake is that it often assumes a human shape, the\r\nlimbs in particular being formed like human extremities.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest literary eras mandrake was a customary ingredient in\r\nlove-potions. Circe, the sorceress who appears in Homer’s _Odyssey_, was\r\ntraditionally an adept in concocting brews with mandrake infusions. So\r\nintimately was her name linked with this man-shaped plant, that it\r\nbecame known as _Circe’s plant_.\r\n\r\nAs later Biblical confirmation of the significance of mandrake, the\r\nstrange and moving episode of Jacob and Rachel and the employment of the\r\nvery effective mandrake may be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThere is a further suggestion of its use in the Song of Songs.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks and the Romans likewise were acquainted with mandrake and its\r\nvirtues. The Greeks considered the root an amatory excitant, and, by\r\nassociation, called Aphrodite, who presided over amatory functions,\r\nMandragoritis, She of the Mandrake. Plutarch, the Greek philosopher and\r\nbiographer, alludes to the plant and its resemblance to human genitalia.\r\nIn his monumental encyclopedia, the _Natural History_, the Roman Pliny\r\nthe Elder similarly dwells on this likeness, and adds that when a\r\nmandrake root that has grown into male genital form is found, it will\r\nunquestionably secure feminine love.\r\n\r\nWithout interruption the tradition of the mandrake lingered through the\r\ncenturies. Old chroniclers allude to it. Woodcuts and illustrations in\r\nmedieval vellum-bound folios present readers with the horrifyingly\r\nsemi-human form of the plant. Sinister and abhorrent legends have grown\r\nup around the plant, many of them associated with death, gibbets,\r\nhangings, thieves.\r\n\r\nMedieval folklore trusted to the consumption of the root as a reliable\r\nhelp in conception. This belief is also confirmed by a seventeenth\r\ncentury traveler. Sorcerers and alchemists and other occult\r\npractitioners concocted their elixirs with the aid of mandrake.\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century English herbalist, John Gerarde, refers to\r\nmandrake in his _Herball or General Historie of Plantes_, and to its use\r\nin conception, particularly in the case of barrenness. He merely touches\r\non its employment in amatory practices, but he is repulsed by the\r\nprurient and salacious nature of these devices.\r\n\r\nIn these days, too, mandrake evidently has not been neglected as a\r\npossible invigorating agent. In Greece and in Italy, folk beliefs in the\r\nplant still survive, and are put into active practice.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSexual and procreative capacity was such a primal, essential factor in\r\nthe old religious cults that, in classical mythology, Greek and Roman,\r\nand in Egyptian and Asian cults as well, the bull, the most potent among\r\nanimals, was the ceremonial and pictorial symbol of this cosmic power.\r\nThe bull, in fact, was equated with divinity. The processional sacrifice\r\namong the Romans, the taurobolium, highlighted the preeminence and the\r\nreverence due to the bull. In Egypt, he appears as Apis, the bull-god.\r\nHe is also present in the Mithraic cult, and Mithra himself is\r\nsculpturally represented as holding a bull and cutting its throat. The\r\nbull was an expiatory sacrifice among the Germanic tribes, and also\r\namong the Northmen. In the Orient, too, the bull is sacred among the\r\nJapanese. Cows, also, have been no less venerated among the Greeks, the\r\nHebrews, and the Hindus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn ancient Egyptian record, the Doulaq Papyrus, reveals, in the\r\ntranslation by the famous Egyptologist Sir William Flinders Petrie, how\r\neven in antiquity sexual passion was channeled, promoted, and\r\ncontrolled: and how the cult of money and the phallic cult often went\r\nhand in hand and were intimately linked together. So that religious\r\nprostitution, the sacred erotic rites of pagan worship, transcended the\r\ncommon activities of the public prostitute and assumed a hieratic,\r\nreverential status.\r\n\r\nThis status is stressed and confirmed in the story of the sacred\r\nprostitute or hierodule Thubui, who was approached by Setna-Khamois, son\r\nof the Egyptian Pharaoh Usimares. In the papyrus the lavish richness of\r\nthe hierodule’s apartment is described, and the bloody conditions she\r\nexacts from her passionate prospective lover.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the barber shops and the perfumers’, in the furtive taverns and the\r\nbaths and eating places, in Greece and later on in Rome, the lower types\r\nof prostitute plied their trade. They might ostensibly be musicians and\r\nsingers of a sort, but these qualifications were mere preliminaries to\r\ntheir more intimate ministrations. The ways of these harlots, their\r\noutlook, their training, their future, are described vividly in Lucian’s\r\nDialogues of the Courtesans and in Alciphron’s fictional letters. The\r\npoets, too, have their say about this institution, and many of their\r\npieces, sensuous and sensual, erotic, scatological and lewd, are\r\npreserved in the Greek Anthology and the Palatine Anthology. In the\r\ncollection known as The Girdle of Aphrodite, one of the pieces deals\r\nwith the theme of Lolita. Another describes the operations of a\r\nmasseuse. Others deal with amorous performances and reflect on love and\r\nits price.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ancient cult of Bacchus, the god of wine and fertility, was marked\r\nby highly erotic rites and orgies and phallic manifestations. Bacchus\r\nhimself was equated with the Greek god Dionysus, whose characteristics\r\nand functions were identical. Dionysus himself was associated with\r\ncertain animals that were reputedly extremely lascivious by nature or\r\nerotically exceptionally dominant. Among these animals were: the bull,\r\nthe ass, the panther, and the goat. The right testis of the ass, for\r\ninstance, worn in a bracelet, was, according to the testimony of Pliny\r\nthe Elder, who produced an encyclopedic Natural History, and the Greek\r\nphysician Dioscorides, considered an effective sexual stimulant.\r\n\r\nIn many regions of ancient Greece, both on the mainland but particularly\r\nin the islands of the Aegean Sea, the Dionysiac cult was prevalent and\r\npassionately celebrated.\r\n\r\nEuripides, the Greek tragic poet, presents a detailed and authoritative\r\npicture of Bacchic ceremonies and beliefs in his drama The Bacchae.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the priests of ancient Chaldea, noted for its thaumaturgic\r\npractices and esoteric cults, there was a tradition that the secretions\r\nof the liver of young boys would be a restorative of physiological\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong professional Greek and Roman courtesans, there were special\r\ndevices for provoking male interest. During entertainments, for\r\ninstance, drinking cups, made of earthenware, emitted a perfumed aura,\r\nwhile the contents themselves, containing myrrh and pepper, were direct\r\nstimulants.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Asia Minor, some four millennia ago, the Sumerians flourished and\r\nproduced a high literary culture. There is still extant a love song,\r\nchanted annually by the Sumerians, that is in the manner of the Biblical\r\n_Song of Songs_. It is an exultant amatory paean, dedicated to Inanna,\r\nthe Sumerian goddess of love and procreation, who may be equated with\r\nthe Babylonian Astarte and the Greek Aphrodite.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStorgethron, a plant used in ancient Greece as an amatory medicine, has\r\nbeen identified as the leek.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe root called surag was, in antiquity, held to have a stimulative\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe aromatic leaves of tarragon, which grows in South East Europe, is\r\nconsidered, in addition to its use as a flavoring agent, as an amatory\r\naid.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe oil extracted from the fresh leaves of the ruta graveolens plant\r\nproduces an amatory excitation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBoth in ancient and in medieval days amatory virtues were attributed to\r\nthe plant known botanically as radix Chinae.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe juice of the plant spurge, in composition with other items such as\r\nginger, nettle seed, pellitory, cinnamon, and cardamom, is considered,\r\namong Arabs, as highly provocative.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe aromatic leaves of sage had an amatory repute. So with tulip bulbs\r\nand savory which the Romans knew as satureia.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHierobota, or pisteriona, an herb mentioned by the medieval philosopher\r\nAlbertus Magnus, was credited with such potency that its mere possession\r\nwas said to act as a stimulant.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPimpinella anisum, which is the botanical designation of anise, is\r\nnative to the Eastern Mediterranean region. The ancients knew anise, and\r\nit was equally familiar to the Middle Ages, as a love attribute.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe testes of animals have always been popular in amatory preparations,\r\nboth for their symbolic implications and also for their genesiac value.\r\nThis was the case with the testes of lamb, deer, ram, and ass.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe head of the perch contains a number of small stones. These were\r\nincluded in the amatory preparations devised by sorceresses.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA French physician, Mery, in a treatise entitled _Traité Universel des\r\nDrogues Simples_, stated that the partes genitales of a rooster served\r\nas a potent stimulus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPartridge was, according to the old writer Platina, in his _De\r\nValetudine Tuenda_, believed, apart from its gastronomic relish, to\r\n‘arouse the half-extinct desire for venereal pleasures.’\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn antiquity, snails were consumed for amatory purposes. The Roman poets\r\nrefer to this practice. Even in modern times a concoction of snails,\r\nboiled in parsley, garlic, and onions, and fried in oil and again in red\r\nwine, is reputed to serve as a rejuvenating factor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn ancient Egyptian device for achieving amatory efficiency involves a\r\nmagic procedure:\r\n\r\n    Take a band of linen, of sixteen threads. Four of them white.\r\n    Four, green. Four, blue. Four, red. Fasten all strands into one\r\n    band, and strain with hoopoe blood. Bind with scarab posed as\r\n    the sun-god wrapped in byssus. Bind to the body of the boy\r\n    attendant who holds the sacred vessel.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe worship of the phallus in antiquity was not originally the worship\r\nof the human generative organs, but of the divine procreative faculty\r\nsymbolized by the genitalia of the sacred bull and the sacred goat: in\r\nEgyptian religious terminology, by Apis and Priapis or Priapus\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nIn Greece, the phallus, originally symbolic of the goat or bull, was\r\nattached, disproportionately and _a posteriori_, to a human figure: so\r\nthat the phallus, in the course of time, became erroneously associated\r\nwith human capacity.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Athenian orator Isocrates postulated a maxim: What is improper to do\r\nis improper to say. Yet a rigid adherence to this view would mean a\r\ncessation of investigations of all kinds, of many historical records and\r\narchives, mores, and often matter that would give enlightenment on human\r\ntraditions and the more intimate details of communal, tribal, or\r\nnational life, of ethnic distinctions, of cultural progression.\r\n\r\nHence it might be more advisable to adapt the postulate of Isocrates and\r\nto introduce the proviso that whatever has been done or said or written\r\nby men should normally and regularly be transmitted to later generations\r\nor to wider circles, provided that this transmission is intended as a\r\ncontribution to a knowledge of the past, or of contiguous races, or of\r\ndisparate mores, and as a revealing exposition of what man performed in\r\nearlier ages, and not as a prurient and lewd inducement to wallow in\r\nscatological or libidinous depths for mere light or indifferent or\r\ntransitory entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe anthropologist, the archaeologist, the professional scholar, the\r\nhistorian are, by virtue of their interests and training and their\r\noccupations, constantly dealing with subjects that have either been\r\ntaboo in a general sense, or that involve the most secretive\r\nphysiological and emotional human situations.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ancient cult of the stars merged with religious ceremonials and\r\nreligious beliefs, emerging in the zodiacal bull. This bull was\r\nanciently equated with the sun in its most auspicious phase, in spring\r\ntime. The sun bull later became the actual bull itself, as in the Minoan\r\nand the Mithraic cults, and also among the Egyptians. For the bull was\r\nnow definitely the symbol of creative potency, of cosmic fecundity and\r\nperpetuation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe energized, salient phallus was the supreme symbol of being and\r\nfertility. In antiquity it had divine significance. It was carried in\r\nreligious processions in ancient Egypt, in Greece, in the Greek islands,\r\nin Phoenicia, Assyria, and in Chaldea and Ethiopia. In Egypt, phalli,\r\nmade of porcelain, were worn on the person as periapts.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn their fulminations against pagan mores and the sexual and erotic\r\nlicentiousness and aberrations that were so prevalent in antiquity both\r\nsocially and religiously, the ancient writers themselves were so\r\ndescriptively forthright and detailed in their denunciations, that these\r\nvery assaults and condemnatory attacks constitute in themselves,\r\ncumulatively, a vast corpus of circumstantial knowledge of ancient\r\nsalaciousness, prurience, perversions, and total abandonment of amatory\r\nand sexual restraints. Among such witnesses and authorities were the\r\nChurch Fathers Tertullian, Arnobius, and Clement of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThe religious practice of women submitting or rather offering themselves\r\nto the priapic symbol, the phallus or lingam, dates back to millennia\r\nbefore this era. Herodotus, the Greek historian, mentions it; also\r\nStrabo the geographer, and the Church Father Clement of Alexandria.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient Moabites, the god Baal-Peor, that was at one time\r\nworshipped by the Israelites and then execrated, was an idol equated\r\nwith the Greek and Roman phallic Priapus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe consciousness that in Nature, in the totality of the cosmic scheme,\r\nand in human beings the love motif conditions all existence and the\r\ncontinuance of being is manifest in the images, the religious rituals,\r\nsymbols, ceremonials, and sacrificial offerings of all peoples, in every\r\nage, ancient and modern, in Greece and among the Romans, in\r\npre-conquered Mexico and in India, throughout the East and in the\r\nPacific Islands, and among the early tribal and racial denominations of\r\nEurope—the Germani and the Suevi, the Galli and the Normanni.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the Euphrates, in Syria, there was anciently a vast,\r\nelaborate, richly decorated and endowed temple. At the entrance rose two\r\ngigantic phalli, dedicated, as the inscription ran, by Bacchus to the\r\ngoddess Juno. Offerings were made to the phalli by the thronging\r\nsuppliants, while within the building numerous wooden phalli were\r\ndispersed throughout the spacious interior. Similar images and rituals\r\nwere manifest in contiguous countries, in Phoenicia, Persia, and\r\nPhrygia.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThroughout every polis and colony and settlement of ancient Greece, and\r\nalso in the regions of the Mediterranean littoral, in Egypt and the\r\nMiddle East, the phallus was a symbol of veneration always associated\r\nwith religious ritual, with hieratic traditions, and temple worship on a\r\nwide and enthusiastic scale.\r\n\r\nIn Greece, there were the phallic hermae, enormous phalli attached to\r\npedestals, tree-trunks, boundary-markers. They were protective and\r\napotropaic, and where the phalli appeared, there would credibly be\r\nfecundity and erotic consummation, generation and abundance, in man and\r\nbeast and throughout the cosmic design.\r\n\r\nThe phallus was variously named Priapus and Tutunus and Mutunus and\r\nFascinum and, in Hindu religious mythology, the lingam. Among the\r\nesoteric Gnostics, Jao, the sun-god, equipped with ithyphallic force,\r\nhad properties akin to those of Priapus. Thus the generative, energizing\r\norgans of virility, of the cosmic erotic impulse and of its purpose,\r\nare, despite variations of name and epichorial traits and accretions,\r\nbasically comprehended under one concept, in all proto-history, in\r\nverifiable history, and, by traditional progression, in later ages.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAntiquity, free from the modern attitude that makes demarcations between\r\nwhat is obscene and what is not so, venerated the sexual act, and its\r\nsymbolic representation of the phallus, as significant of the universal\r\nsense of generation and procreation. As a consequence, all sexual, all\r\namatory performances, references, allusions were accepted as an integral\r\nelement in human life, and involved no intrusive image of salaciousness,\r\nprurience, lewdness.\r\n\r\nThis phallic reverence, in its widest and most sweeping sense, was\r\nespecially prevalent among the ancient Greeks. But it was not confined\r\nto this people. It was prevalent in Asia Minor, among the Hittites and\r\nthe Sumerians, the Accadians and the Parthians, the Medes and the\r\nBabylonians and the Phoenicians. It was prevalent in Egypt and the North\r\nAfrican littoral, and it was equally prevalent along the Mediterranean\r\ncoastal regions. In the Far East, particularly but not exclusively in\r\nIndia, the cult of the phallus was a devout religious experience,\r\nequated with the dominant cults of the cosmic deities.\r\n\r\nIn later ages, when the human body became as it were dichotomous in\r\nfunction, the merely physiological acts began to be held in lesser\r\nesteem, and even became condemnatory in status, open to reproach and\r\ndisdain, and even violent abuse and ill-treatment. The body, in fact,\r\nbecame obscene, invested with evil forces, compounded of malefic and\r\ndefiled factors. The body was to be crushed and tortured and disfigured,\r\nin order to release the spiritual complements of the human being. The\r\namatory acts were now turned into licentious and mephitic obscenities,\r\ninto bestial defilements, into unspeakable carnal and animal\r\nmanifestations of the lower nature. As a consequence, phallic worship,\r\nthe glorification of the creative principle embodied in the male and\r\nfemale, went underground. And by the mere fact of going underground, it\r\npersisted, with qualifications, acquiring through the course of time\r\nveneers of secrecy, accretions of furtiveness, elements of ribaldry as a\r\nkind of protective coat.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEssentially, the phallic symbol was anciently viewed as an amatory\r\nagent, a generative stimulant, in as much as the phallus was cosmically\r\nthe source of all being. Therefore offerings were made to the phallus in\r\nsacrificial rituals, just as to any other potent deity from whom\r\nprivileges and favors were sought. Libations of milk were a normal form\r\nof offering to Priapus. Women, anxious to become mothers, stood\r\nreverently and suppliantly in puris naturalibus before the all-potent\r\nphalli, and in a further urgent procedure, performed the act of erotic\r\nconsummation with the aid of the lingam figure itself. For the phallus,\r\nin a pose of lubricity, was the final appeal, the ultimate resort, of\r\nthe pleading, awed, reverential mortal.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong cities where the generative force symbolized by the phallus was\r\nheld in deep veneration, were Orneae, Cyllene, and Colophon. Under the\r\nlater impact of Christianity, however, the phallic cult diminished in\r\nits influence and extent, or was re-directed into other channels. In one\r\nspecific direction, the cult merged into the Orphic mysteries.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nErotic awareness never went further than in the case of a city in Troas\r\nnamed Priapus, on account of its consecration to the cult of the\r\nphallus. There were other cities too, according to the testimony of\r\nPliny the Elder, that were named Priapus for identical reasons. In the\r\nCeramic Gulf there was an island named Priaponese: and an island in the\r\nAegean Sea called Priapus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA notorious incident in Greek history involved the nocturnal mutilation\r\nof hermae, in 415 B.C. Hermae were bronze or marble pillars surmounted\r\nby a head and a phallus. These marble figures appeared in the streets\r\nand squares of Athens and other Greek cities.\r\n\r\nSuspicion for the defilement and desecration of the hermae fell upon the\r\nbrilliant but wayward Athenian general and statesman Alcibiades and his\r\ncompanions. As a result, Alcibiades was condemned to banishment.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe cult of Priapus and his obscene association with the genitalia of\r\nthe ass, the symbol of unbridled lust, were expounded in ancient fable\r\nand legend. Other commentaries and explanations were added later by\r\nHyginus, who flourished in the first century A.D. Hyginus wrote on\r\nreligious subjects and mystic cults. Pausanias, the Greek traveler and\r\ngeographer, who belongs in the second century A.D., and Lactantius, the\r\nfourth century Church Father, also dwelt on the subject.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf all cities of ancient Greece, Lampsacus, situated on the banks of the\r\nHellespont, was most dedicated to the veneration of Priapus. In a\r\nlegendary fable it was demonstrated that the origin of the priapic cult\r\nwas Lampsacus itself.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Greek festival called Thargelia, celebrated in May, the rites\r\nwere dedicated to Apollo, the sun god, and to Diana, the moon goddess.\r\nAt the ceremonial there was a procession of youths who carried olive\r\nbranches hung with food, fruit, and images of phalli.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe genesiac theme, in its most lustful implication, was so prevalent in\r\nearly history that there was a sect, known as the Baptae, dedicated to\r\nCotytto, an obscene and lewd goddess. They celebrated their nocturnal\r\nabominations at Athens, Corinth, in Thrace, and on the island of Chios.\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiar features of the Baptae was their custom of drinking\r\nfrom glass vessels shaped like a phallus. Juvenal, the Roman satirist,\r\nin describing the Baptae and their mystic and symbolic rites, refers to\r\none participant who drinks from a glass Priapus: vitreo bibit ille\r\nPriapo.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccording to the testimony of the Greek historian Herodotus, a certain\r\nMelampus brought the cult of Bacchus, the worship of the generative\r\ncapacity, to Greece, approximately in the thirteenth century B.C. He\r\nexpounded the features of the Egyptian cult and established processional\r\nrites and ceremonies adapted from Egyptian usage.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn ancient Greece Bacchus, the phallic divinity, was equated with\r\nDionysus. In the cities the Greater Dionysia, or the Urban Dionysia,\r\nwere celebrated in his honor for three days. The locale was at Limnae in\r\nAttica, and the season was the middle of the month of March.\r\n\r\nIn very early times, the Greek biographer and philosopher Plutarch\r\ndeclares, the rites were of a simple but joyous nature. But in his own\r\ntime the celebration had reached a lavish, extravagant splendor.\r\n\r\nWomen, devotees of the Bacchic symbol and known as Bacchantes,\r\nintroduced the ritualistic procession. Chaste maidens, impeccable in\r\nmorality and of distinguished birth, followed. These were the\r\nCanephoroi, the Basket-bearers who bore on their heads baskets\r\ncontaining the sacred utensils used at the celebration: together with\r\nmystic objects, flowers, salt, sesame, and a flower-bedecked phallus. A\r\ndetachment came next to the Canephoroi: these were the Phallophoroi. The\r\nPhallophoroi were the Phallus-bearers, carrying, attached to long\r\nstaffs, the phallic emblem.\r\n\r\nMusicians were also in the march, chanting and accompanying the choral\r\nodes with twanging strings, and at brief intervals emitting loud\r\nexclamations in glorification of the god.\r\n\r\nThere were other strange participants. The Ithyphalli, men dressed in\r\nwomen’s garments, who chanted salacious phallic songs. Scandalous satyrs\r\nled goats for sacrifice, while Bacchantes performed obscene dance\r\nmovements. There was, over the entire celebration, an atmosphere of\r\ndebauchery and libidinous license consonant with the phallic context of\r\nthe cult.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Carthage, a spot outside the city was consecrated to Astarte, the\r\ngoddess of generation, and called Sicca Veneria. Among the Phoenicians a\r\nsimilar spot, intended for the same purpose, that is religious\r\nfornication, was known as Siccoth Venoth.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Biblical antiquity, the primary concept was for man to be fruitful\r\nand multiply, and replenish the earth. To this end, concubinage was\r\nconsequently not frowned upon and was practiced _pari passu_ with\r\nmarriage. Maid servants were commonly taken by their masters as\r\nconcubines, as in the case of Hagar, and also in that of Reumah. Lot\r\neven gave his maiden daughters for the satisfaction of the lustful\r\ninhabitants of Sodom. Later, he committed incest with these daughters.\r\n\r\nThe servant women of Jacob, Bilhah and Zilpah, became his concubines.\r\nThese are instances, among many others, that illustrate cases of\r\nadultery and fornication that do not appear to have had a condemnatory\r\nstigma or reproach attached to them. For the object in these\r\ncircumstances was procreation and propagation and that was the primal\r\nfunction enjoined upon man.\r\n\r\nThe corollary is that sterility is a personal reproach in Biblical\r\ntimes, a social defect that is looked upon with opprobrium, particularly\r\nin Oriental countries.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Spain, the phallic cult was practiced under the name of Hortanes.\r\nThis cult is mentioned by the Roman epic poet, Silius Italicus, in his\r\n_Punica_. He describes the orgiastic revels of Satyrs and Maenads in\r\nnocturnal rites in honor of the Hispanic fascinum.\r\n\r\nIn the South of France, also, and in Belgium, excavations unearthed\r\nrelics, monuments, amulets and other artifacts, bas-reliefs and\r\nantiquities of various kinds, all testifying to the ancient cult of\r\nPriapus and his functions and the deep and wide reverence for his\r\nomnipotence. In Germany, Priapus lost the somewhat indulgent character\r\nof a phallic and generative deity responsive to supplication and\r\npromise, and became a violent, blood-lusting monstrosity. In parts of\r\nEastern Europe, again, Priapus became Pripe-Gala, sanguinary and\r\ndestructive.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAncient Armenia had a deity analogous to Priapus or Aphrodite or\r\nAstarte. She was known as Diana Anaïtis, and her cult involved temple\r\nprostitution. The same practice, on the testimony of the Greek historian\r\nHerodotus, was in vogue in Lydia. Another writer, the Roman geographer\r\nPomponius Mela, who belongs in the first century A.D., has similar\r\nreferences in the case of an African people called the Augilae.\r\n\r\nAgain, the practice was prevalent at Naucratis, in Egypt.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe phallic cult, that was originally consecrated to the propagation of\r\nall things, in as much as the fascinum itself symbolized the sacred\r\nregeneration of all Nature, in time degenerated so that only the phallus\r\nas such became the symbol of lust and passion and debauchery. It became\r\nthe emblem of excesses in erotic encounters, the sign of the prostitute.\r\nPriapus actually became an object of some contempt, a humble scarecrow\r\nof the fields, chthonic guardian of the orchards, a subject of coarse\r\nribaldry, as is testified in the Latin corpus of poems known under the\r\nname of Priapeia.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lascivious mores of the Egyptians under the guise of veneration of\r\nthe priapic bull Apis, and their obscene dances, rituals, and similar\r\nperformances are described and commented on in great detail by Herodotus\r\nin his History of the Persian Wars.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe genitalia and all references to the phallic image were in very\r\nancient times held in such sacred esteem and reverence that in Biblical\r\nliterature the inviolable sanctity of an oath was ratified by touching\r\nthe area of the genitalia, or the thigh, to use the Biblical euphemism.\r\nThe Hebrews especially held the generative organs in the greatest\r\nrespect, socially, ethnically, and religiously: and nudity as a\r\nconsequence was a matter of shameful stigma and opprobrium.\r\n\r\nAmong the Moslems too the most binding oath was taken with respect to\r\nthe sanctity of the genitalia.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, in the temple of Isis, sacred prostitution was a regular\r\nreligious practice. Reference to this circumstance is made by the Roman\r\nsatirist, Juvenal, who calls Isis a procuress and her shrine a\r\nrendez-vous for adulterous and libidinous practices.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong symbolic emblems that represented, in combination, the male and\r\nfemale principles of generation and fecundity, were the Egyptian crux\r\nansata and the seal of Solomon.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe phallic symbol was so pervasive, so potent, in the lives of the\r\nancients, that the priapic function and the erotic variations of the\r\ngenerative performance were pictorially represented in every conceivable\r\nform of reproduction: scenes on vases representing perverted\r\nconsummations: baskets filled with phalli that were offered for sale to\r\nyearning women: ithyphallic figures: monuments, lamps and other objects\r\ndepicting orgiastic lubricities.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Ezekiel 16.17 there is a reference to the phallic figure: Fecisti\r\ntibi imagines masculinas et fornicata es in eis.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn one of the bucolic Idyls of the Greek poet Theocritus (c. 310–c. 250\r\nB.C.) the maiden Simaetha, in love with Delphis, who has abandoned her,\r\nattempts to regain his love by performing certain magic rites and making\r\ninvocations to Selene, Aphrodite, and the horrendous Hecate.\r\n\r\nShe fashions a wax image of Delphis and by sympathetic magic anticipates\r\nthe melting of his heart in correspondence with the melting of the\r\nimage.\r\n\r\nIn addition, she makes use of the magic wheel, and her refrain\r\nthroughout the performance is:\r\n\r\n                    My magic wheel, draw home to me\r\n                    The man I love!\r\n\r\nIntertwined with these rituals is the further refrain, addressed to\r\nSelene, the moon goddess:\r\n\r\n                        Bethink thee of my love,\r\n                        And whence it came,\r\n                        My Lady Moon!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his _De Sanitate Tuenda Praecepta_, Advice on keeping Well, Plutarch,\r\nthe Greek philosopher and biographer, comments on lust and potions:\r\n\r\nWhile we loathe and detest women who contrive philtres and magic to use\r\nupon their husbands, we entrust our food and provisions to hirelings and\r\nslaves to be all but bewitched and drugged. If the saying of Arcesilaus,\r\naddressed to the adulterous and licentious, appears too bitter, to the\r\neffect that ‘it makes no difference whether a man practices lewdness in\r\nthe front parlor or in the back hall,’ yet it is not without its\r\napplication to our subject. For in very truth, what difference does it\r\nmake whether a man employ aphrodisiacs to stir and excite licentiousness\r\nfor the purpose of pleasure or whether he stimulate his taste by odors\r\nand sauces to require, like the itch, continual scratchings and\r\nticklings.\r\n\r\n                                                                  (Loeb)\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Greek mythology, Andromache, the wife of the Trojan warrior Hector,\r\nwas accused by Hermione, wife of Neoptolemus, of gaining his love by\r\nmeans of love-potions. Euripides, the tragic poet (c. 485–406 B.C.),\r\nrefers to the situation in his drama _Andromache_:\r\n\r\n             Not of my philtres thy lord hateth thee,\r\n             But that thy nature is no mate for his.\r\n             That is the love-charm: woman, ’tis not beauty\r\n             That witcheth bridegrooms, nay, but nobleness.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPhiltres were in actual use beyond mythological times. Xenophon (c.\r\n430–354 B.C.), the Greek historian, author of _Memorabilia_, alludes to\r\nthe practice:\r\n\r\n    “They say,” replied Socrates, “that there are certain\r\n    incantations which those who know them chant to whomsoever they\r\n    please, and thus make them their friends; and that there are\r\n    also love potions which those who know them administer to whomso\r\n    they will; and are in consequence loved by them.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPropertius, however, the Roman elegiac poet (c. 48 B.C.–16 B.C.), refers\r\nto the futility of love potions:\r\n\r\n                      Here herbs are of no avail,\r\n                      nor nocturnal Cytaeis,\r\n                      nor grasses brewed by the\r\n                      hand of Perimede.\r\n\r\nCytaeis is the witch Medea: while Perimede is another witch, called by\r\nHomer Agamede.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Bacchic cult in Egypt is described by the Greek historian Herodotus\r\nin Book 2 of his _History of the Persian Wars_:\r\n\r\n    To Bacchus, on the eve of his feast, every Egyptian sacrifices a\r\n    hog before the door of his house, which is then given back to\r\n    the swineherd by whom it was furnished, and by him carried away.\r\n    In other respects the festival is celebrated almost exactly as\r\n    Bacchic festivals are in Greece, excepting that the Egyptians\r\n    have no choral dances. They also use instead of phalli another\r\n    invention, consisting of images a cubit high, pulled by strings,\r\n    which the women carry round to the villages. A piper goes in\r\n    front, and the women follow, singing hymns in honor of Bacchus.\r\n    They give a religious reason for the peculiarities of the image.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Book 5 of _The History of the Persian Wars_, Herodotus describes some\r\nof the marital customs of the Thracians:\r\n\r\n    The Thracians who live above the Crestonaeans observe the\r\n    following customs. Each man among them has several wives; and no\r\n    sooner does a man die than a sharp contest ensues among the\r\n    wives upon the question, which of them all the husband loved\r\n    most tenderly; the friends of each eagerly plead on her behalf,\r\n    and she to whom the honor is adjudged, after receiving the\r\n    praises both of men and women, is slain over the grave by the\r\n    hand of her next of kin, and then buried with her husband. The\r\n    others are sorely grieved, for nothing is considered such a\r\n    disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe Thracians who do not belong to these tribes have the customs which\r\nfollow. They sell their children to traders. On their maidens they keep\r\nno watch, but leave them altogether free, while on the conduct of their\r\nwives they keep a most strict watch. Brides are purchased of their\r\nparents for large sums of money.... The gods which they worship are but\r\nthree, Mars, Bacchus, and Dian.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn ancient Hittite text contains invocations and rituals intended to\r\nremedy conditions of incapacity or lack of erotic desire.\r\n\r\nA sacrifice is performed to Uliliyassis, continuing for three days. Food\r\nis prepared: sacrificial loaves, grain, a pitcher of wine. The shirt of\r\nthe male suppliant is brought forth.\r\n\r\nThe suppliant bathes. He twines cords of red and of white wool. A sheep\r\nis sacrificed. An invocation is made, beseeching help and favor: Come to\r\nthis man, the cry arises. Come down to this man. Make his wife conceive\r\nand let him beget sons and daughters.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn Egyptian love song, belonging in the second millennium B.C., is still\r\nextant. The love song was usually chanted to a musical accompaniment.\r\nThe lover is addressed as sister, or brother.\r\n\r\nThe heart is sick from love, laments the victim, and no physician, no\r\nmagician can heal this disease, except the appearance of the sister.\r\nThere is abundant reference to spices, to myrrh and incense, and the\r\ntone of the amatory supplications and yearnings is the tone of the Song\r\nof Songs. Listlessness on the part of the love-sick suppliant is\r\nbanished, as soon as he beholds his beloved, as soon as her arms open in\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn ancient orgiastic cults, particularly those dedicated to Dionysus and\r\nto the Syrian Baal, religious frenzies were accompanied or stimulated by\r\ndrugs, fermented drink, by rhythmic dance movements, by tambourine,\r\ndrum, and flute music that culminated in ecstatic self-mutilation\r\nfollowed by wild sexual debaucheries.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPassion, lust, incest, fornication, adultery, as well as concubinage and\r\npolygamy, most of the sexual perversions and aberrations that are now\r\nincluded under medico-psychiatric categories, occur in the Bible, in\r\nboth Testaments.\r\n\r\nKing David married eight women. On his flight from Absalom he left ten\r\nconcubines behind him. Jacob had two wives. King Solomon had seven\r\nhundred wives and three hundred concubines.\r\n\r\nThere are instances of enduring affection too, as in the case of Jacob,\r\nwho labored for Rachel for fourteen years.\r\n\r\nThere is sudden, rapturous love at first sight, at all costs:\r\n\r\n    It happened, late one afternoon, when David arose from his couch\r\n    and was walking upon the roof of the king’s house, that he saw\r\n    from the roof a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful.\r\n    And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, “Is\r\n    not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the\r\n    Hittite?”\r\n\r\n    So David sent messengers and took her, and he lay with her.\r\n\r\nAmnon is overwhelmed by a passionate infatuation for his half sister\r\nTamar. He was so tormented that he made himself sick because of his\r\nsister. He is advised by his friend Jonadab to go to bed and claim\r\nillness. Tamar brings him food and at this point Amnon attempts\r\nseduction. When she suggests an approach to the king, for permission to\r\nmarry Amnon, his lust overpowers him, and he consummates his passion.\r\nAfter which, in a frenzy of hate, he banishes her.\r\n\r\nThe Song of Solomon is a paean to sexual love, an erotic exultation, the\r\napogee of amatory sensuality.\r\n\r\nIn the New Testament, too, there is frequent reference to harlots and\r\ndebauchees and to a variety of ‘sinners.’\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBabylonian customs, in addition to the rites of temple prostitution,\r\nincluded both male and female sacred concubines. There was considerable\r\npre-marital sexual freedom. But there was also monogamous marriage\r\ninvolving rigid fidelity. Trial marriage was acknowledged. Adultery was\r\npunished by drowning the guilty wife. In the degenerative days of\r\nBabylon, morality broke down. Male prostitutes rouged their cheeks and\r\nbedecked themselves with jewelry, while the poor exposed their daughters\r\nto prostitution. Sensuality and erotic libertinage became dominant and\r\npervasive.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the Canaanites the most potent deities—Baal and El and\r\nAsherah—were the symbols of procreation and sexuality. Hence, all acts,\r\nall objects, all rituals associated with copulation, with the phallus,\r\nwith fecundity were divinely inspired and inherently sacred. Ceremonials\r\ndedicated to the deities invariably included sexual activity, sacred and\r\necstatic orgies. The voluptuous and sensual character of the dedicatory\r\nrites was evidently so appealing that they lured the Israelites into\r\nacceptance and imitation, for the deity of the Israelites was one,\r\nsupreme, without kin, without consort, without sexuality.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe New Testament attacks pagans, particularly Roman paganism, for\r\nunnatural sexual practices, lusts, and corrupt and degenerate mores.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn primitive Greek society, under a primal matriarchy, the male\r\nfunctioned as a kind of passive sexual partner, and virtually thereafter\r\nas a domestic drudge.\r\n\r\nBut in the course of the centuries the male acquired dominance, in the\r\ndivine pantheon, and equally on a mortal and earthly plane, politically,\r\nsocially, and domestically.\r\n\r\nBut the concept of the inter-relationship of the sexes grew into a\r\nconcept of one primary harmonious principle of aesthetics, of essential\r\nperfection of beauty, irrespective of sex and hence irrespective of any\r\ncompulsive admiration and appreciation of such beauty by one sex or the\r\nother. Beauty became an entity in itself, a sexless trait. In the\r\nPlatonic dialogue, in fact, in the _Symposium_, the theory is postulated\r\nthat man was at one time androgynous.\r\n\r\nThe Greek hetaira or male companion was virtually a prostitute.\r\nSometimes she acquired a more permanent status, when she was bought by a\r\nmaster and became a _pallakis_ or concubine.\r\n\r\nHomosexuality, on the other hand, brought no stigma to the boys or young\r\nmen involved in the practice. Because homosexuality was a corollary,\r\napplied in practice, of the primary concept of aesthetic beauty\r\nirrespective of sex.\r\n\r\nIn the case of women, there was the corresponding though possibly not so\r\nwidespread cult of tribadism.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Romans cultivated sexuality, particularly in a heterosexual\r\ndirection, with great vigor and lustfulness. It was largely through the\r\ngrowing consciousness of Rome as an imperial power, and through the\r\nincrease in industry and commerce, in wealth and consequent luxury and\r\nidleness, that perversions of all kinds increased and multiplied to such\r\nan abnormal extent that in the first century A.D. the Romans themselves,\r\nthrough their own poets, commented on the situation and contrasted it,\r\nwith some sense of nostalgia, with the severe and rigid and essentially\r\nstabilized moral code that prevailed in the old pre-imperial days.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the Roman Empire, with the increase of childless families, women\r\nwere able to give more scope to their femininity, their sexual appeal,\r\nand their erotic allurements. As a consequence, there was an upsurge of\r\nmarital license, on the part of both husband and wife, but notoriously\r\nso in the case of the women. This situation reached the most shameless\r\ndepths, as the poet Juvenal testifies: and as the Church Fathers later\r\non asserted, in their wholesale condemnations of pagan practices.\r\n\r\nEarly in the first century A.D. the insidious decline of domestic\r\nmorality became so manifest that imperial decrees required marriage in\r\nthe case of men under sixty and of women under fifty: and these\r\nordinances also restricted the freedoms of bachelorhood.\r\n\r\nMarriage was thus officially encouraged, and large families were granted\r\nspecial privileges and monetary awards from the imperial treasury. But\r\nthese and similar measures were abortive in their primary purpose. For\r\nprostitution flourished and grew and became so flagrant and yet so\r\ncharacteristically identified with later Roman society that there were\r\nat least a score of designations for the public harlot, according to her\r\nsocial status, her price, and her locale. Thus lust and eros were\r\nrampantly triumphant.\r\n\r\nHarlotry was manifestly rife in Old Testament days, for there is\r\nrepeated allusion to the practice: in the symbolism of Oholah and\r\nOholibah, in the Psalms and in the prophets, particularly Isaiah and\r\nJeremiah, in the Book of Judges, and in Samuel.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is mention of the allurements of the harlot: her\r\nchamber fragrant and enticing with spices and perfumes, aloes and myrrh\r\nand cinnamon.\r\n\r\nThere is reference to the personal seductive persuasiveness of the\r\nharlot’s coaxing words, the urgency of her erotic devices.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Old Testament mentions and illustrates the morality involved in\r\nsexual impulses resulting in physiological consummations. Under certain\r\ncircumstances, stoning the guilty pair was enjoined. In some cases, the\r\nman only was punished, by death. In other situations the man who spurned\r\nthe woman after carnally knowing her was whipped and fined one hundred\r\nshekels of silver. For fornication, the death penalty was normally\r\nenforced. Sacred prostitution in the temple, too, whether affecting male\r\nor female, was prohibited.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHomosexuality and sacred male prostitution are both known to the Bible.\r\nIn Deuteronomy there is an injunction against the sons of Israel\r\nbecoming sacred prostitutes. The abominations of Sodom receive ample\r\ntreatment. Even transvestism is prohibited, for it suggests sexual\r\ndubiety, physiological ambiguity, and a possible merging of the sexes, a\r\npotential elimination of the sexual demarcations. Other amatory\r\nabnormalities also appear in Biblical contexts, among them: rape,\r\nvoyeurism, and bestiality.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the onset of the Hellenistic Age, concurrent with Alexander the\r\nGreat’s death in 323 B.C., the Mysteries, the exclusive secretive cults,\r\nadvanced in importance and in the extent of their influence. Many of\r\nthese cults came from the East and merged, with adaptations and various\r\namplifications or modifications, into the Greek and Roman religious\r\nsphere. The cult of Cybele, Magna Mater Deorum, the Mighty Mother of the\r\ngods, was most dominant, transcending all other cults and to some degree\r\nabsorbing them. In addition, there were the cults of Sabazios, of\r\nMithras, of Isis and Osiris. These cults bound the initiates to close\r\nsecrecy: and thus only occasional fragments, hints, references from\r\nvarious sources can present any degree of coherence and design in the\r\ncults. It is known that there were dramatic presentations involving\r\ncommunion with the deities, dark rites and ceremonials, even vague\r\nadumbrations of the concept of immortality, as well as castigation and\r\ncastration, fertility symbolisms and seasonal fructifying cycles. There\r\nwere, further, the Gnostics, searchers for divine knowledge. Some of\r\nthese speculative cosmologists were scrupulously ascetic in every sense,\r\nwhile others orgiastically indulged, toward the attainment of the same\r\nend, in fleshly passions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the Greek celebration of the Phallophoria, leather or wooden\r\nrepresentations of the phallus were carried processionally through the\r\npublic streets of the polis. It was the thematic manifestation of\r\nall-embracing fertility, on land, among the beasts of the fields, and in\r\nhuman relationships. It was a kind of visual paean, in fact, to the\r\nprimal sexual impulse, to the basic erotic conflict.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest instances of multiple incest occurs in Book 10 of\r\nHomer’s _Odyssey_, in which Odysseus describes his visit to Aeolus.\r\nAeolus has a family of six daughters and six sons, and he has given his\r\ndaughters in marriage to his own sons.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Greece the Aphrodision, and in Rome the Venereum, were the private\r\nbordellos that were not used by the general indiscriminate public.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBoth in antiquity and in later ages the public baths, with both sexes in\r\nnude contacts in the _balnea mixta_, were a direct amatory stimulant. As\r\nfurther provocatives, there was, in particular cases, bathing in asses’\r\nmilk, in essences of myrtle and lavender, in rose water, in almond paste\r\nand in honey water, and also in champagne.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Greece, the phallus was so pervasive as a genesiac symbol in every\r\nphase of daily life, that there were loaves baked in phallic form. These\r\nloaves were known, for another erotic reason, as olisbokolices.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDrillopotae were glass vessels in phallic form. They were used, in\r\nancient Rome, as drinking cups: and thus were an added erotic reminder\r\nat banquets and similar gatherings.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Roman antiquity the color yellow was associated with prostitutes, and\r\nwas a symbol of their profession. Yellow still retained this\r\nsignificance in the Central European countries in later ages. In Tsarist\r\nRussia, the yellow ticket was the official prostitute’s occupational\r\ntoken. Alexander Kuprin’s _Yama the Pit_ describes the situation in a\r\nvivid and grim narrative.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFigurae Veneris is a Latin expression meaning _positions of Venus_. This\r\nphrase refers to the range of sexual positions. The Greeks were familiar\r\nwith some seventy such permutations and manipulations. There were the\r\nsymplegma and the catena, which involved more than two partners, and the\r\ndodekamechanon. Hesychius the Greek lexicographer, Philaenis, and, among\r\nthe Romans, the poet Martial mention these contortions. In the Middle\r\nAges, the licentious poet Pietro Aretino produced a poetic commentary on\r\nthe entire extent of erotic possibilities.\r\n\r\nAmong periapts and amulets that were credited with promoting erotic\r\nactivity were charms in the shape of an extended hand, a wild boar, the\r\nhead of a bull, astrological signs; magic formulas too, inscribed on\r\nvarious objects; the crux ansata, and genitalia.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong erotic pieces that are no longer extant are certain elegiac poems,\r\nof an amatory type, attributed formerly to Plato the philosopher. An\r\nancient Roman poet named Laevius wrote an erotopaegnion. Apuleius, the\r\nRoman philosopher and novelist, produced a number of amatory epigrams.\r\nThese references, together with others that include Vergil’s _Aeneid_\r\nand the _Georgics_, are made by the Roman poet Ausonius himself.\r\n\r\nHe adds, also, that, like Martial and other poets, his life is\r\nunblemished though his verses may be dubious:\r\n\r\n    Igitur cui hic ludus noster non placet, ne legerit: aut cum\r\n    legerit, obliviscatur: aut non oblitus, ignoscat.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPhallic priests were called phallobatai. Not only Priapus, but other\r\ndeities as well in ancient Greece, were worshipped with erotic fervor.\r\nAmong these were Phanes, Lordon, and Orthanes.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Metropolitan Museum of Art\r\n\r\n  LOVE AND PSYCHE\r\n\r\n  _by Rodin_\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Philadelphia Museum of Art\r\n\r\n  THE ABDUCTOR\r\n\r\n  _by Rodin_\r\n]\r\n\r\nPhilodemus of Gadara, who flourished in the first century B.C., was a\r\nGreek poet who settled in Rome. He became an intimate of powerful\r\npolitical forces, and also gathered around him a coterie of Romans\r\ninterested in philosophy and literature. Among other works, mostly of a\r\nphilosophical nature, Philodemus produced erotic pieces marked by\r\nextreme lewdness. Some twenty-five of these epigrams are still extant,\r\ncollected in the corpus known as the _Anthologia Palatina_. These poems\r\nbecame popular in Rome and were imitated by both Horace and Ovid.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs an erotic stimulus, Greek women wore diaphanous thin-spun robes made\r\nof silk from the island of Cos. In Rome, similarly, prostitutes\r\nsometimes wore a toga vitrea—a glassy or transparent toga. There were,\r\ntoo, vestes sericae—silk dresses, in feminine use.\r\n\r\nAll such robes, of course, were of a purposely revealing and tantalizing\r\nnature, acting upon the viewer in a marked amatory direction. Seneca,\r\nthe Roman Stoic philosopher, makes blunt and condemnatory remarks on the\r\ncustom.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Athens, there was an old quarter of the city dedicated to\r\nprostitution of the lowest type. This area was known as the Ceramicus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe agents who acted as intermediaries, as panders and procurers and\r\nenticers in the furtive sexual commerce, in the seamy undercurrents of\r\nancient life, were known under various descriptive designations. In\r\nGreece, there were the maulis and the draxon, the karbis and the\r\nproagogos, the mastropos, the prokyklis and the nymphagogos and the\r\npornoboscos. Romans had their own counterparts: the professional\r\nprocurer, the leno, the mercator meretricius, the admissarius and the\r\ninstitor, the lenonum minister, the perductor and the conductor: and,\r\namong the female operatives, the agaga and the stimulatrix, the\r\nconciliatrix and the stupri sequestra.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPhallic symbols enter into the Biblical context in I Kings, where Judah\r\nis described as building high places and pillars on every high hill.\r\nThese pillars were actually phallic symbols, in the style of the\r\nabominations of the Canaanite cults.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn antiquity, in Biblical and post-Biblical times, the woman, in the\r\nwidest sense, was the amatory slave of man. But with the woman’s\r\nincrease of knowledge in erotic skills and practices, in the secrets of\r\nher potent physiological attractions, in the use of unguents and\r\ncosmetics, potions and concoctions, in corporeal and mechanistic\r\nallurements and seductions, the woman’s status gradually rose and\r\nextended and became all-embracing. Slowly, by virtue of these very\r\nartifices and techniques, by means of gyrations and gestures,\r\nprovocative dances and tantalizing dress, silent invitations and ocular\r\nspeech, she began to dominate man, to render him subservient and even\r\nobsequious, to control his habits and inclinations and tendencies in\r\nsocial and political directions: until woman, reaching the apogee of her\r\npower, based primarily on her erotic compulsiveness, became the woman\r\nbehind the throne. She had attained her highest end, her ultimate\r\ndestiny, as the implicit director of human activities. She usurped man’s\r\nstatus, and assumed the regal baton. She manipulated kings and sultans,\r\nand her endearments were bought at the price of nations. She decided the\r\nfate of empires by her mere brusque whims, or personal resentment, her\r\nunpredictable likes. Man exchanged realms and justice for her amatory\r\nacquiescence, her erotic beneficence.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a formal religious-ceremonial sense, antiquity acknowledged\r\nparticipation of women in the sacred temples. In Asia Minor, in the\r\ncults of Baal-Peor, in the Egyptian cults of Isis and Osiris, in the\r\nMediterranean Hellenic islands where the cult of Aphrodite in various\r\nforms and of analogous deities of passion and lust and procreation was\r\nprevalent, in the case of the Vestal guardians of the Roman state\r\nreligion, priestesses took part in the hieratic rituals, in festive\r\nceremonials, in sacrificial and processional rites.\r\n\r\nEven with the advent of Christianity the Greek church in the East had\r\nits female votaries, while deaconesses were normally attached to the\r\nChurch in the West. In the course of time, however, this acquiescence in\r\na female priesthood turned into resentment, into hate, and finally into\r\nbitter and continuous official condemnation. Woman became the evil\r\ndaemon, the essence of every malefic, licentious, forbidden, obscene\r\npractice, the sink of turpitude, the scourge of men, the destruction of\r\nhumanity. Thus many early Fathers of the Church, Tertullian and Arnobius\r\nand Clement of Alexandria, inveigh against the serpentine machinations\r\nof woman. Hence this view and these attitudes were transmitted into the\r\nMiddle Ages. In these middle centuries woman is depicted as the ally of\r\nSatanic forces, powerful on account of her very femininity, her presumed\r\ninnocent frailty. She is essentially guileful and treacherous, amoral\r\nand immoral, and bent on the spiritual subjugation and desecration of\r\nperplexed man. Woman became the symbol of all sin, the prototype of\r\nevery sacrilegious concept. She was stripped of a soul. She was in\r\nleague with the demoniac tenebrous forces, the Satanic legions that\r\nfurtively and thaumaturgically work their evil spells on man. She\r\nbecame, in short, the Anti-Christ incarnate, the Abominable Witch,\r\nconsort of horned and hoofed Satan. And her attractions, her feminine\r\nbeauty, were merely distorted and insidious forms of her fundamental\r\niniquities.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWoman was conceived as attaining her sanguinary or lustful purposes by\r\nmeans of feminine stratagems or conspiratorial schemes, by personal\r\nruthlessness that swept aside all frustrations, all moralities, and\r\nstopped neither at poisoning nor at murder. The roster of such women, in\r\nthe stream of universal history, is long and challenging. It includes,\r\namong many others equally notorious, equally branded, Lilith and\r\nCleopatra, Claudia and Messalina, Antonina and Theodora, Catherine of\r\nRussia and Elizabeth Bathory, Madame de Montespan and Lady Kyteler, the\r\nBorgias and Isobel Gowdie, Jeannette Biscar: and, in goetic contexts,\r\nSagana, Canidia, and Oenothea.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAphrodite had many forms, multiple aspects of her functions and her\r\npatronage, numberless descriptive designations, both in Greece itself\r\nand in the cults of Asia Minor where her attributes were equated with\r\nthe properties of analogous and indigenous divinities. But basically she\r\nwas one, the universal, the cosmic force that dominates all amatory\r\ncontacts, that drives men, intent votaries of the goddess and bent on\r\nadherent dedication to her offices, to the realization of her\r\ninjunctions at all costs, resorting to charms and mystic recipes, to\r\nfantastic interpretations of precious stones and flowers, to talismans\r\nand amatory manuals, grimoires, exotic herbs and insidious preparations.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor centuries man and woman have displayed mutual hostilities and\r\nresentments in a number of directions: personally and socially,\r\npolitically and spiritually. Yet there appears a strange dichotomy in\r\nthis human pair of male and female. They have despised each other and\r\nhave sought each other, as Plato suggests in one of his more fanciful\r\nmoments. The mutual act of racial procreation merged and was\r\nsubsequently largely lost in the erotic consummations itself. So that,\r\nas the complexities of life grew, and as its manifestations multiplied\r\nand offered man a variety of experiences, motifs, recreational\r\nfacilities and diversions, the woman as such came into her own, and\r\nAphrodite established her sacred and profane sanctuaries at the\r\ncrossroads, in sundered islands of the Aegean Sea, on the highways, in\r\nluxurious retreats, and in rural fastnesses. And, casting aside all\r\nspiritualities in man’s search for a teleological significance to\r\nexistence, made Eros the alpha and omega, the final purpose, of cosmic\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInitiation into the cult of Aphrodite was known by the Greek expression\r\nmysterion: the mystery. The participants, the mystai, after bathing in\r\nthe sea—and the sea itself was symbolic, for it was the source of\r\nAphrodite’s own birth—, they assembled in the evening in the Mystery\r\nHall. Torches were lit, casting flitting shadows and tenebrous shapes\r\nthrough the chamber.\r\n\r\nThen the ritual began. There were recitals by the initiates. Sacred\r\nobjects were shown to the awed gathering, as well as certain phenomena\r\nabout which too little knowledge has been transmitted. Then some kinds\r\nof performances were presented, all associated with the portentous\r\nrelation between mortals, striving toward passionate intimacy with the\r\ndivinity, and the puissant deity herself.\r\n\r\nThree degrees of initiation were in force: the first initiate approach:\r\nthe preliminary stage: and the highest rites. This final ritual, it is\r\nbelieved, brought into communion the adept and the deity. Erotic and\r\nsexual symbols were dominant factors in this ceremonial.\r\n\r\nIn this mystic cult of the goddess, the hierodule, the courtesan, is the\r\nintermediary between the suppliant and the divinity. She is the sexual\r\npassport, so to speak, that leads to the more secretive ritual of the\r\nAphroditic temple.\r\n\r\nThere is, in the course of this rite, the necessity for a purgation, a\r\npurification by water. There is a reference to such an initiation in the\r\nRoman poet Juvenal’s second satire. He speaks of a mystic sect called\r\nthe Baptae. This expression derives from the Greek baptizo, dipping in\r\nwater. The Baptae drank, as an element in their ritual, powerful liquids\r\nfrom phallus-shaped vessels. These Baptae were devotees of Cotytto, an\r\nobscene and salacious goddess.\r\n\r\nWomen were not admitted to the Aphroditic rites: but, strangely, the men\r\ncame robed as women, painted and powdered and reeking in exotic\r\nperfumes. Subsequently, they dedicated themselves to every form of\r\nsexual subtlety.\r\n\r\nIn another more advanced stage of initiation, where physical love became\r\nsublimated, Aphrodite was in this phase the Syrian goddess Derceto or\r\nAtargatis: the half woman, half fish deity. Basically she was a\r\nfertility goddess, sometimes called Dea Syria, the Syrian goddess, the\r\nuniversal divinity. Her cult is described by the Greek writer Lucian:\r\nand Apuleius, the Roman philosopher and novelist, speaks about her\r\npriests, the wandering Galli:\r\n\r\n    How the Priests of the Goddesse Siria Were Taken and Put in\r\n    Prison.\r\n\r\nAfter that we had tarried there a few dayes at the cost and charges of\r\nthe whole Village, and had gotten much mony by our divination and\r\nprognostication of things to come: The priests of the goddesse Siria\r\ninvented a new meanes to picke mens purses, for they had certaine lofts,\r\nwhereon were written: Coniuncti terram proscindunt boves ut in futurum\r\nlaeta germinent sata: that is to say. The Oxen tied and yoked together,\r\ndoe till the ground to the intent it may bring forth his increase: and\r\nby these kind of lottes they deceive many of the simple sort, for if one\r\nhad demanded whether he should have a good wife or no, they would say\r\nthat his lot did testifie the same, that he should be tyed and yoked to\r\na good woman and have increase of children. If one demanded whether he\r\nshould buy lands and possession, they said that he should have much\r\nground that should yeeld his increase. If one demanded whether he should\r\nhave a good and prosperous voyage, they said he should have good\r\nsuccesse, and it should be for the increase of his profit. If one\r\ndemanded whether hee should vanquish his enemies, and prevaile in\r\npursuite of theeves, they said that this enemy should be tyed and yoked\r\nto him: and his pursuite after theeves should be prosperous. Thus by the\r\ntelling of fortunes, they gathered a great quantity of money, but when\r\nthey were weary with giving of answers, they drave me away before them\r\nnext night, through a lane which was more dangerous and stony then the\r\nway which we went the night before, for on the one side were quagmires\r\nand foggy marshes, on the other side were falling trenches and ditches,\r\nwhereby my legges failed me, in such sort that I could scarce come to\r\nthe plaine field pathes. And behold by and by a great company of\r\ninhabitants of the towne armed with weapons and on horseback overtooke\r\nus, and incontinently arresting Philebus and his Priests, tied them by\r\nthe necks and beate them cruelly, calling them theeves and robbers, and\r\nafter they had manacled their hands: Shew us (quoth they) the cup of\r\ngold, which (under the colour of your solemne religion) ye have taken\r\naway, and now ye thinke to escape in the night without punishment for\r\nyour fact. By and by one came towards me, and thrusting his hand into\r\nthe bosome of the goddesse Siria, brought out the cup which they had\r\nstole. Howbeit for all they appeared evident and plaine they would not\r\nbe confounded nor abashed, but jesting and laughing out the matter, gan\r\nsay: Is it reason masters that you should thus rigorously intreat us,\r\nand threaten for a small trifling cup, which the mother of the Goddesse\r\ndetermined to give to her sister for a present? Howbeit for all their\r\nlyes and cavellations, they were carryed back unto the towne, and put in\r\nprison by the Inhabitants, who taking the cup of gold, and the goddesse\r\nwhich I bare, did put and consecrate them amongst the treasure of the\r\ntemple.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAphrodite exacted from her devotees certain prescribed ceremonies,\r\ntestimonies to their communion with the goddess, palpable evidences of\r\ntheir total mystic and spiritual absorption in the sacraments she\r\ndemanded of her votaries.\r\n\r\nThe ritual followed an established design. At sunset the catechumen is\r\nconducted to the temple. Then, facing the East, the priest raises his\r\nleft hand skyward and with his right he seizes a bronze knife, plunges\r\nit into boiling water, and then performs the ritual sexual rite with\r\nrespect to the catechumen.\r\n\r\nThen followed solemn and hieratic instruction in the amatory procedures,\r\nincluding the methods of arousing erotic sensibilities, provocative\r\npostures and gestures, words and formulas, osculation and its pervasive\r\ncorporeal significance. There were, furthermore, illustrative\r\nconsummations, considered without lewdness, but accepted as formal\r\nelements in the grave cosmic scheme. There was a musical accompaniment\r\nthat softly intertwined in the sequence of the various rituals and\r\npresentations, a kind of amatory, seductive litany, enfolding the entire\r\nceremonial in a sacred aura of mysticism. In the concluding phase of\r\nthese rites, there appeared the phallic procession, the symbolic\r\nglorification of the creative urge, and the actual illustration of this\r\npotency culminated in an abandoned sexual orgy, indiscriminate and\r\nincestuous, exultant and fleshly, carnal and spiritual in one fervid\r\nsyncretism. A concomitant of this vast sensual exhibition, this release\r\nof the physical carapace, was prostitution itself, which for long\r\nretained a ritualistic character.\r\n\r\nThe next step in this genesiac process was sacred prostitution, whereby\r\nthe woman symbolized the solemnity and the compulsiveness of the\r\nAphroditic cult, while the man was the visitant, a suppliant for the\r\nfavor of the divinity. And the hierodule thus was a kind of prototype,\r\nassociated with wise skills, a vestal of the goddess, initiating men\r\ninto secret amatory and sacred rituals: an adept too in concocting love\r\nphiltres to further genesiac exultation, to induce total participation\r\nin a sort of Aphroditic gnosticism.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Aphroditic injunction embraced, in a sense, the entire cosmos. It\r\ninvolved primarily self-love, love of being, awareness of the\r\nsignificant entity, the ego itself, marked by dignity, by esteem. Then\r\nfollowed the love of the social milieu of which one formed part, and of\r\nthe impulse to maintain its equilibrium by contributing one’s own\r\nefforts, one’s personal function, to the totality of the social frame.\r\nLastly, there was a kind of all-embracing, comprehensive cosmic love,\r\ndirected to a synthesis of corporeal love that mystically rose to a\r\nsublimated spiritual-amatory zone.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the mystic cults, it was postulated that the amatory embrace partakes\r\nof both a human and a cosmic form of attraction, and becomes, in a\r\nsublimated degree, an act of prayer, an erotic supplication.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe priapic cult was the male counterpart of the Aphroditic cult. Just\r\nas the hierodule was the official priestess of the goddess, mentor in\r\nthe feminine erotic and reverential mysteries, so the priapic cult had\r\nfor its primary objective the exaltation of the male generative\r\nprinciple. In remote antiquity, and particularly in Egyptian mysticism,\r\nthe phallus was the representative symbol of Osiris, the ultimate\r\ncreative potency. Gradually, in the course of the centuries, the phallic\r\nsymbol acquired a pejorative and degrading and exclusively and narrowly\r\nfunctional nature associated with the mere physical act. And Priapus,\r\nequated at one time with Osiris, degenerated into a secondary and minor\r\nfigure, a mere rustic threat. Yet Priapus retained some semblance of his\r\nformer repute. He still had his temple and his priestly ministrants. He\r\nstill received favors and offerings. He still made promises to his\r\ndevotees and listened to their urgent amatory pleas. He still maintained\r\nhis sexual rituals, however much they had lost their spiritual and\r\ncosmic values. He still presided, in the actuality of performance, over\r\nmarriage initiations, over nuptial consummations. But with time he\r\ndisappeared as a member of the mystery cults. And only in vestiges of\r\nlegend, in old rites transmitted into the Middle Ages, in sculptural\r\npresentations, in phallic symbolisms, did his former magnificence and\r\nhis primary rank retain any fragmentary reminiscence of his vanished\r\nglories.\r\n\r\nIn the smaller towns of Italy festive occasions in honor of Priapus were\r\nperpetuated until far into the Middle Ages; and Priapus, in some\r\ninstances, particularly in Brittany, in Belgium, and in France, merged\r\nwith Christian saints, who appropriated, in their turn, the genesiac\r\nproperties of their prototype.\r\n\r\nIn rural districts, shrines dedicated to Priapus defied the spread of\r\nChristianity, while phallic forms, in marble and stone, adorned public\r\nbuildings, baths, columns, churches. Priapus, to some extent, thus went\r\nunderground. He became a furtive and then an obsolescent and forgotten\r\nfigure: but in Switzerland and in Sweden, in Provence and in Germany,\r\nPriapus clung tenaciously, if only in an etymological sense. For Friday,\r\nFriga’s day, is merely a Teutonic or Anglo-Saxon form of the Day of\r\nPriapus.\r\n\r\nStrange how the antique charms and periapts, the old Roman fascina, were\r\nstill suspended from the necks of children and women: often without any\r\nawareness of the actual significance of the talisman, but just as\r\nfrequently, until late into the fourteenth century at least,\r\necclesiastical ordinances and prohibitions made it evident that there\r\nwas official knowledge of the priapic survival.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient Chaldeans, Assyrians, and Babylonians, the erotic cult\r\nwas dedicated to the fertility deities Ishtar and Bel and Sin. Ishtar\r\nwas the Mesopotamian Aphrodite: a goddess of love and at the same time a\r\nwarrior deity. Bel is Baal-Peor, the phallic deity, while Sin is the\r\nmoon divinity.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAphrodite, as a universal goddess, with universal erotic functions that\r\nembrace all humanity, all elements of the cosmos, appears in different\r\nregions and centuries under a variety of names. She is Aphrodite\r\nCallipygos and she is Aphrodite Anosia: Aphrodite Peribaso and Aphrodite\r\nAnadyomene and Aphrodite Hetaira. Sometimes she is designated with\r\nreference to her beauty, or to her amatory functions, or to her\r\nepichorial association with temple worship dedicated to her person, or\r\nto the suppliants whom she intimately protects. She is thus Aphrodite\r\nPandemos and Aphrodite Porne. She is Aphrodite Trymalitis and Aphrodite\r\nStratonikis. She is Aphrodite Pontia and Aphrodite Urania.\r\n\r\nThen she becomes, retaining her essential character but merely\r\ntransferring her rituals, Venus Fisica and Venus Caelesiis and Venus\r\nErycian. She is the Cytherean and the Paphian, she is the Cyprian\r\ndivinity.\r\n\r\nShe is known, again, as Anaïtis and as Astoreth. She is Allat and\r\nArgimpasa and Atargatis. In later ages she is Milda in Eastern Europe\r\nand Merta and Freya in the North.\r\n\r\nBut under whatever designation she appears, in Arabia or Scythia, in the\r\nGreek Islands or in Carthage, she is fertility incarnate and love. She\r\nis the alma Venus genetrix that the Roman poet Lucretius reverently\r\ninvokes.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThrough the ages the concept of generation has undergone progressively\r\ndefinitive changes. In proto-historical times, when legend and myth,\r\nmingling with supernatural fantasies, conceived imaginative unrealities\r\nin relation to the medical and physiological facts, the ancient Hindu\r\nepics assumed man as sprung from the forests, from aspen and ash trees,\r\nsylvan creatures, in some sense, corresponding to the half-human form of\r\nthe ancient Hellenic satyrs. In some regions of India there was a belief\r\nthat the produce of certain trees was human beings, male and female, and\r\nthat the mortals fell upon the earth like ripe fruit. Among the Persians\r\nand contiguous races of antiquity, pregnant women were given soma juice\r\nto drink, to ensure handsome children. Soma is an intoxicating brew that\r\nis often mentioned in Vedic religious rituals. According to Pliny the\r\nElder’s testimony, water in which mistletoe has been steeped encourages\r\nprocreation in women and animals.\r\n\r\nThe oak tree and the chestnut also have been reputed to aid in\r\nprocreation. So with plants too, that have at all times been treated as\r\npotential and actual amatory aids. An African legend makes a girl, after\r\ndrinking the juice of a certain plant, give birth to a mighty warrior.\r\n\r\nThe chewing of lilies was considered conducive to fertility, in medieval\r\nfolklore. So, in still earlier times, with the pomegranate and the\r\nalmond. In many cases, the belief arose from the similarity of the plant\r\nor flower or herb, in certain respects, to the genitalia or the pudenda.\r\nThis was so in the case of the bean. So with mandrake, and cress, and\r\ncertain species of berries.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother legendary mode of conception, prevalent in ancient classical and\r\nOriental mythology, was theriomorphic theogamy: that is, generation by a\r\ndivinity who assumes animal form.\r\n\r\nInstances are multiple. Zeus, in the shape of a bull, pursues Europa in\r\ncow form. In Egypt, Apis the bull has a similar function. The seductive\r\nserpent, again, is Zeus once more, exercising his protean capacity. On\r\noccasion, he becomes a swan, and associates with Leda. Or he becomes a\r\nvariety of creatures: an ant, or a dove, or a goat, or an ass. Once,\r\nNeptune, for a similar purpose, turned into a ram.\r\n\r\nSometimes, also, the divine serpent, sinuous and wily and knowledgeable,\r\nis actually devoured by the woman, as in Arab regions.\r\n\r\nNot only animals and plants were associated with generative capacities,\r\nbut natural phenomena as well: the winds and storms, hail and the sun\r\nand the rain. Some primitive tribes attributed their origin to snow:\r\nsome to lightning, or to thunder, to the rainbow, to clouds, to the\r\nmorning star. A warm breeze, or a cyclone might equally well have been\r\ntheir source. Greek, Roman, and Chinese myths contain numberless\r\nillustrations of astral or phenomenal association with mortal\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nThere is a wry anecdote on this phase in Flavius Josephus, the\r\nhistorian. An ingenious suitor performs the function of the deity Anubis\r\nwith complete faithful acceptance.\r\n\r\nThis type of mortal substitution in place of the divinity was common in\r\nthe priestly rituals of Egypt, and was not unknown in Asia Minor, in\r\nIndia, and in China.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPeriapts or talismans as an erotic provocation were anciently devised in\r\nphallic form. They were carried on the person, by both men and women, or\r\nwere used to decorate temples and shrines and public buildings.\r\n\r\nIn later ages, amatory talismans assumed a great variety of forms, in\r\nthe shape of rings, necklaces, plaques engraved with formulas or\r\nastrological figures and signs of the Zodiac or possibly a bull, a dove,\r\na number or a series of mystic numbers. A piece of parchment might be\r\ninscribed with names, or the alphabetical sign of Venus. Precious stones\r\nwere talismans, each possessing an esoteric virtue or property according\r\nto color or substance. A periapt might be set in some strategic spot:\r\nburied underground, placed under a pillow: or even ground into a powder.\r\n\r\nThe all-powerful goddess herself, Venus, had her own minerals. Copper,\r\nassociated with the love goddess, was known to the Greeks as aphrodon.\r\nTin also was of Aphroditic significance: while sulphur springs were\r\nalso, in a legendary sense, related to Venus.\r\n\r\nIt has even been credited that floral nomenclature contains amatory\r\nsignificance, and that certain plants have their erotic symbolisms.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFlowers in antiquity as well as in modern times had their erotic\r\nimplications. To the Greeks and Romans, the essence of _areté_, of\r\nbeauty and perfection, was the rose, while the Egyptians too revered the\r\nrose as the prototype of perfection.\r\n\r\nTo Aphrodite were consecrated the mistletoe and myrtle, the lily,\r\nsatyrion, the iris, celandine, sengreen, mallow, and verbena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                                 GREEK\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plato_\r\n\r\nPlato (c. 429–347 B.C.), the Greek philosopher who developed his\r\nmetaphysical and cosmological theories through a series of some\r\ntwenty-five dialogues and the _Apology_, has a great deal to say on the\r\nerotic theme.\r\n\r\nIn the _Timaeus_, he says of sexual excess:\r\n\r\n    He who has the seed about the spinal marrow too plentiful and\r\n    overflowing, like a tree overladen with fruit, has many throes,\r\n    and also obtains many pleasures in his desires and their\r\n    offspring, and is for the most part of his life deranged because\r\n    his pleasures and pains are so very great; his soul is rendered\r\n    foolish and disordered by his body; yet he is regarded not as\r\n    one diseased, but as one who is voluntarily bad, which is a\r\n    mistake. The truth is that sexual intemperance is a disease of\r\n    the soul due chiefly to the moisture and fluidity which is\r\n    produced in one of the elements by the loose consistency of the\r\n    bones. And in general, all that which is termed the incontinence\r\n    of pleasure and is deemed a reproach under the idea that the\r\n    wicked voluntarily do wrong is not justly a matter for reproach.\r\n    For no man is voluntarily bad, but the bad become bad by reason\r\n    of an ill disposition of the body and bad education—things which\r\n    are hateful to every man and happen to him against his will.\r\n\r\nAgain, of sexual love, Plato says, in the _Timaeus_:\r\n\r\n    On the subject of animals, then, the following remarks may be\r\n    offered. Of the men who came into the world, those who were\r\n    cowards or led unrighteous lives may with reason be supposed to\r\n    have changed into the nature of women in the second generation.\r\n    And this was the reason why at that time the gods created in us\r\n    the desire of sexual intercourse, contriving in man one animated\r\n    substance, and in woman another, which they formed,\r\n    respectively, in the following manner. The outlet for drink by\r\n    which liquids pass through the lung under the kidneys and into\r\n    the bladder, which receives and then by the pressure of the air\r\n    emits them, was so fashioned by them as to penetrate also into\r\n    the body of the marrow, which passes from the head along the\r\n    neck and through the back, and which in the preceding discourse\r\n    we have named the seed. And the seed, having life and becoming\r\n    endowed with respiration, produces in that part in which it\r\n    respires a lively desire of emission, and thus creates in us the\r\n    love of procreation. Wherefore also in men the organ of\r\n    generation becoming rebellious and masterful, like an animal\r\n    disobedient to reason, and maddened with the sting of lust,\r\n    seeks to gain absolute sway, and the same is the case with the\r\n    so-called womb or matrix of women. The animal within them is\r\n    desirous of procreating children, and when remaining unfruitful\r\n    long beyond its proper time, gets discontented and angry, and\r\n    wandering in every direction through the body, closes up the\r\n    passages of the breath, and, by obstructing respiration, drives\r\n    them to extremity, causing all varieties of disease, until at\r\n    length the desire and love of the man and the woman, bringing\r\n    them together and as it were plucking the fruit from the tree,\r\n    sow in the womb, as in a field, animals unseen by reason of\r\n    their smallness and without form; these again are separated and\r\n    matured within; they are then finally brought out into the\r\n    light, and thus the generation of animals is completed.\r\n\r\nIn the _Symposium_, Plato postulates a philosophy of love:\r\n\r\n Love is the love of beauty and not of deformity?\r\n He assented.\r\n And the admission has been already made that love is of that\r\n which a man wants and has not?\r\n True, he said.\r\n Then love wants and has not beauty?\r\n Certainly, he replied.\r\n And would you call that beautiful which wants and does not possess\r\n    beauty?\r\n Certainly not.\r\n Then would you still say that love is beautiful?\r\n Agathon replied: I fear that I did not understand what I was saying.\r\n Nay, Agathon, replied Socrates; but I should like to\r\n ask you one more question:—is not the good also the\r\n beautiful?\r\n Yes.\r\n Then in wanting the beautiful love wants also the\r\n good? I can not refute you, Socrates, said Agathon.\r\n And let us suppose that what you say is true.\r\n\r\n Say rather, dear Agathon, that you can not refute the\r\n truth; for Socrates is easily refuted.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    And now I will take my leave of you, and rehearse the tale of\r\n    love which I heard once upon a time from Diotima of Mantineia,\r\n    who was a wise woman in this and many other branches of\r\n    knowledge. She was the same who deferred the plague of Athens\r\n    ten years by a sacrifice, and was my instructress in the art of\r\n    love. In the attempt which I am about to make I shall pursue\r\n    Agathon’s method, and begin with his admissions, which are\r\n    nearly if not quite the same which I made to the wise woman when\r\n    she questioned me: this will be the easiest way, and I shall\r\n    take both parts myself as well as I can. For, like Agathon, she\r\n    spoke first of the being and nature of love, and then of his\r\n    works. And I said to her in nearly the same words which he\r\n\r\n    “As in the former instance, he is neither mortal fair; and she\r\n    proved to me as I proved to him that, in my way of speaking\r\n    about him, love was neither fair nor good. “What do you mean,\r\n    Diotima,” I said, “is love then evil and foul?”\r\n\r\n    “Hush,” she cried; “is that to be deemed foul which is not\r\n    fair?”\r\n\r\n    “Certainly,” I said.\r\n\r\n    “And is that which is not wise, ignorant? do you not see that\r\n    there is a mean between wisdom and ignorance?”\r\n\r\n    “And what is this?” I said.\r\n\r\n    “Right opinion,” she replied; “which, as you know, being\r\n    incapable of giving a reason, is not knowledge (for how could\r\n    knowledge be devoid of reason? nor again, ignorance, for neither\r\n    can ignorance attain the truth), but is clearly something which\r\n    is a mean between ignorance and wisdom.”\r\n\r\n    “Quite true,” I replied.\r\n\r\n    “Do not then insist,” she said, “that what is not fair is of\r\n    necessity foul, or what is not good evil; or infer that because\r\n    love is not fair and good he is therefore foul and evil; for he\r\n    is in a mean between them.”\r\n\r\n    “Well,” I said, “love is surely admitted by all to be a great\r\n    god.”\r\n\r\n    “By those who know or by those who don’t know?”\r\n\r\n    “By all.”\r\n\r\n    “And how, Socrates,” she said with a smile, “can love be\r\n    acknowledged to be a great god by those who say that he is not a\r\n    god at all?”\r\n\r\n    “And who are they?” I said.\r\n\r\n    “You and I are two of them,” she replied.\r\n\r\n    “How can that be?” I said.\r\n\r\n    “That is very intelligible,” she replied; “as you yourself would\r\n    acknowledge that the gods are happy and fair—of course you\r\n    would—would you dare to say that any god was not?”\r\n\r\n    “Certainly not,” I replied.\r\n\r\n    “And you mean by the happy, those who are the possessors of\r\n    things good and fair?”\r\n\r\n    “Yes.”\r\n\r\n    “And you admitted that love, because he was in want, desires\r\n    those good and fair things of which he is in want?”\r\n\r\n    “Yes, I admitted that.”\r\n\r\n    “But how can he be a god who has no share in the good or the\r\n    fair?”\r\n\r\n    “That is not to be supposed.”\r\n\r\n    “Then you see that you also deny the deity of love.”\r\n\r\n    “What then is love?” I asked; “Is he mortal?”\r\n\r\n    “No.”\r\n\r\n    “What then?”\r\n\r\n    “As in the former instance, he is neither mortal nor immortal,\r\n    but in a mean between them.”\r\n\r\n    “What is he then, Diotima?”\r\n\r\n    “He is a great spirit, and like all that is spiritual he is\r\n    intermediate between the divine and the mortal.”\r\n\r\n    “And what is the nature of this spiritual power?” I said.\r\n\r\n    “This is the power,” she said, “which interprets and conveys to\r\n    the gods the prayers and sacrifices of men, and to men the\r\n    commands and rewards of the gods; and this power spans the chasm\r\n    which divides them, and in this all is bound together, and\r\n    through this the arts of the prophet and the priest, their\r\n    sacrifices and mysteries and charms, and all prophecy and\r\n    incantation, find their way. For God mingles not with man; and\r\n    through this power all the intercourse and speech of God with\r\n    man, whether awake or asleep, is carried on. The wisdom which\r\n    understands this is spiritual; all other wisdom, such as that of\r\n    arts or handicrafts, is mean and vulgar. Now these spirits or\r\n    intermediate powers are many and divine, and one of them is\r\n    love.”\r\n\r\n    “And who,” I said, “was his father and who his mother?”\r\n\r\n    “The tale,” she said, “will take time; nevertheless I will tell\r\n    you. On the birthday of Aphrodite there was a feast of the gods,\r\n    at which the god Poros or Plenty, who is the son of Metis or\r\n    Discretion, was one of the guests. When the feast was over,\r\n    Penia or Poverty, as the manner was, came about the doors to\r\n    beg. Now Plenty, who was the worse for nectar (there was no wine\r\n    in those days), came into the garden of Zeus and fell into a\r\n    heavy sleep; and Poverty considering her own straitened\r\n    circumstances, plotted to have him for a husband, and\r\n    accordingly she lay down at his side and conceived love, who\r\n    partly because he is naturally a lover of the beautiful, and\r\n    because Aphrodite is herself beautiful, and also because he was\r\n    born on Aphrodite’s birthday is her follower and attendant.”\r\n\r\n                                                         (B. Jowett)\r\n\r\nIn Book 8 of _The Laws_, too, Plato discusses a variety of subjects,\r\namong them festivals and contests in which men and women meet together.\r\nThis topic introduces the question of the sexes, and Plato makes\r\ndefinitive statements in this respect. Licentiousness, he declares, is\r\nabominable. Men ought to live under controlled moderation. That is what\r\nnature herself enjoins. Man otherwise would fall below the level of\r\nbeasts. Here the laws should be restrictive. But if that is not\r\npossible, there must at least be some adherence to decent mores.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLust and desire are discussed in Book 6 of _The Laws_ and in the\r\n_Greater Hippias_. The three universal appetites are food, drink, and\r\nlust of procreation, which is linked with the imperious sexual frenzy\r\nand its concomitant excitements. Sexual desire, the necessities of love,\r\noverflowing into excesses, may be harmful to the welfare of the state.\r\nExcesses must therefore be stemmed and controlled by laws. In this\r\nmanner evil may be diminished and the good of the state as a whole will\r\nbe promoted.\r\n\r\nWith regard to exhausted capacity and the loss of passion as a corollary\r\nto old age, Plato says, in Book I of _The Republic_:\r\n\r\n    I will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men\r\n    of my age flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old\r\n    proverb says; and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance\r\n    commonly is—I can not eat, I can not drink; the pleasures of\r\n    youth and love are fled away; there was a good time once, but\r\n    now that is gone, and life is no longer life. Some complain of\r\n    the slights which are put upon them by relations, and they will\r\n    tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the cause. But\r\n    to me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame that which is\r\n    not really at fault. For if old age were the cause, I too being\r\n    old, and every other old man, would have felt as they do. But\r\n    this is not my own experience, nor that of others whom I have\r\n    known. How well I remember the aged poet Sophocles, when in\r\n    answer to the question, How does love suit with age,\r\n    Sophocles,—are you still the man you were? Peace, he replied;\r\n    most gladly have I escaped from a mad and furious master. His\r\n    words have often occurred to my mind since, and they seem as\r\n    good to me now as at the time when he uttered them. For\r\n    certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom; when\r\n    the passions relax their hold, then, as Sophocles says, we are\r\n    freed from the grasp not of one mad master only, but of many.\r\n    The truth is, Socrates, that these regrets, and also the\r\n    complaints about relations, are to be attributed to the same\r\n    cause, which is not old age, but men’s characters and tempers;\r\n    for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the\r\n    pressure of age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition\r\n    youth and age are equally a burden.\r\n\r\nOf sexual appetite Plato declares, in Book 8 of _The Republic_:\r\n\r\n    Are not necessary pleasures those of which we can not get rid,\r\n    and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us? And they are\r\n    rightly called so, because we are framed by nature to desire\r\n    both what is beneficial and what is necessary, and can not help\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    True.\r\n\r\n    We are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary?\r\n\r\n    We are not.\r\n\r\n    And the desires of which a man may get rid, if he takes pains\r\n    from his youth upwards—of which the presence, moreover, does no\r\n    good, and in some cases the reverse of good—shall we not be\r\n    right in saying that all these are unnecessary?\r\n\r\n    Yes, certainly.\r\n\r\n    Suppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we\r\n    may have a general notion of them?\r\n\r\n    Very good.\r\n\r\n    Will not the desire of eating, that is, of simple food and\r\n    condiments, in so far as they are required for health and\r\n    strength, be of the necessary class?\r\n\r\n    That is what I should suppose.\r\n\r\n    The pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways; it does us good\r\n    and it is essential to the continuance of life?\r\n\r\n    Yes.\r\n\r\n    But the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good\r\n    for health?\r\n\r\n    Certainly.\r\n\r\n    And the desire which goes beyond this, of more delicate food, or\r\n    other luxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if\r\n    controlled and trained in youth, and is hurtful to the body, and\r\n    hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue, may be\r\n    rightly called unnecessary?\r\n\r\n    Very true.\r\n\r\n    May we not say that these desires spend, and that the others\r\n    make money because they conduce to production?\r\n\r\n    Certainly.\r\n\r\n    And of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same\r\n    holds good?\r\n\r\n    True.\r\n\r\n    And the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in\r\n    pleasures and desires of this sort, and was the slave of the\r\n    unnecessary desires, whereas he who was subject to the necessary\r\n    only was miserly and oligarchical?\r\n\r\n    Very true.\r\n\r\n                                                         (B. Jowett)\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNakedness, both of boys and girls, was not an obscenity in ancient\r\nGreece. The statesman Lycurgus, for example, established exercises in\r\nSparta in which boys and girls, in puris naturalibus, took part.\r\n\r\nTo the Greek philosopher Plato, too, nudity involved no indecency. He\r\nactually advocated, in _The Laws_, naked dances by boys and girls, for\r\nthe purpose of mutual acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dioscorides_\r\n\r\nPedanius Dioscorides, who flourished in the first century A.D., was born\r\nin Anazarbus. He became an army physician: but, in addition, he was\r\ndeeply interested and versed in pharmacological subjects. With the\r\npurpose of compiling a kind of encyclopedic work in this field,\r\nDioscorides traveled widely throughout Greece, Asia Minor, and the\r\nMediterranean countries, collecting information, legends, and\r\nprescriptions.\r\n\r\nDioscorides is the author of a systematic Materia Medica, written with\r\nclarity and precision and with an informative rather than a stylistic\r\npurpose. His work includes plants and herbs, animals, minerals: all\r\narranged in exact subdivisions, and emphasizing the medicinal and\r\npharmacological virtues of all the items included. The text is arranged\r\nin five books, and covers some thousand drugs. An English translation,\r\nunder the title of the Greek Herbal of Dioscorides, was produced by John\r\nGoodyer in 1655, and was edited by Robert T. Gunther and first printed\r\nby the Oxford University Press in 1934.\r\n\r\nApart from the fascination of the work in itself, Dioscorides lists a\r\nnumber of herbs and roots that are of amatory interest as philtres.\r\nGoodyer’s text, for the relevant items, follows:\r\n\r\n  Greek Cyclamen: It is sayd also that the root is taken amongst\r\n      love-procuring medicines being beaten, and soe made into\r\n      Trochiscks. Trochiscks are pastilles.\r\n\r\n  Brassica Rapa: Turnip: Also called Gongule. The Romans call it Rapum.\r\n      The roote of it being sod is nourishing, yet very windie, and\r\n      breeding moist and loose flesh, and provoking to Venerie.\r\n\r\n      (As an infusion) being dranck it is good against deadly medicines,\r\n      and doth provoke to Venerie.\r\n\r\n  Kuprinon: Oil of Cuperos. An invigorating oil.\r\n\r\n  Lolium Temulentum: Darnel: Being suffumigated with polenta, or Myrrh,\r\n      or Saffron, or Franckincense, it doth help conceptions.\r\n\r\n  Cardamom Lepidium Sativum: Cress: Some call it Cynocardamom. The best\r\n      is found in Babylon. The seed is effectual in inciting to\r\n      copulation.\r\n\r\n  Orchis Rubra: Orchis Papilionacea: And of this root it is said that if\r\n      the greater roote is eaten by men, it makes them beget males, and\r\n      the lesser, being eaten by women, to conceive females. It is\r\n      further storied that ye women in Thessalia do give to drink with\r\n      goates milk ye tenderer root to provoke Venerie, and the dry root\r\n      for ye suppressing, dissolving of Venerie. And that it being drank\r\n      ye one is dissolved by the other.\r\n\r\n  Satyrion: Also called Trifolium, because ‘it bears leaves in three’s,\r\n      as it were,’ bending down to ye earth like to Rumex or Lilium, yet\r\n      lesser, and reddish. But a naked stalk, long, as of a cubit, a\r\n      flower like a Lilly, white; a bulbous root, as bigg as an apple,\r\n      redd, but within white, like an egg, to ye taster sweet and\r\n      pleasant to ye mouth. This one ought to drink in black hard wine\r\n      for ye Opisthotonon, and use it, if he will lie with a woman. For\r\n      they say that this also doth stirr up courage in ye conjunction.\r\n\r\n  Saturion Eruthronion: Called by the Romans Morticulum Veneris. It hath\r\n      a seed like to flax seed. It is said that it doth stirr up\r\n      conjunctions, like ye Scincus doth. It is storied that the root\r\n      being taken into ye hand doth provoke to Venerie, but much more,\r\n      being drank with wine.\r\n\r\n  Salvia Horminum: The Romans call it Geminales. It is an herb like to\r\n      Marrubium. In the wild it is found round swart, but in the other\r\n      somewhat long, and black, of which there is use, and this also is\r\n      thought being drank with wine to provoke conjunction.\r\n\r\n  Galium Verum: Gallion. But ye root doth provoke to conjunction.\r\n\r\n  Katananke: The Romans call it Herba Filicula. The roots are of two\r\n      kinds. ‘But some report that both kinds are good for Philters, and\r\n      they say that the Thessalian women do use them.’\r\n\r\n  Phuteuma: Also called Silene spurium. Phuteuma hath leaves like to\r\n      Radicula, but smaller, much seed, bored through, little root,\r\n      thin, close to the earth, which some relate to be good for a love\r\n      medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nonnus_\r\n\r\nNonnus was a Greek epic poet of Panopolis, in Egypt. He flourished in\r\nthe fifth century A.D., and is the author of _Dionysiaca_. This is a\r\nlong epic poem describing, in abundant detail, with picturesque imagery,\r\nthe triumphal progression of Dionysus, god of wine and fertility, to\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe poem is packed with quaint geographical lore, with a miscellaneous\r\nmass of information on astrology and plants and other subjects\r\nintertwined into the primary theme, and it also contains many erotic\r\nincidents of a mythological nature.\r\n\r\nThe Corybantes take a prominent place in the worship of Dionysus. They\r\nare the frantic, orgiastic priests of Cybele, the Mighty Mother of the\r\nGods, and their passionate ceremonials touch the erotic field.\r\n\r\nThe handsome, effeminate Cadmus appears—the cheeks of his love-begetting\r\nface are red as roses, chants the poet: and the sight of Cadmus is\r\nitself an amatory urge.\r\n\r\nIt is effective, too, in the case of Harmonia, destined to be Cadmus’\r\nmate. Aphrodite addresses the prospective bride:\r\n\r\n    I will teach those grace-breathing kisses to women unhappy in\r\n    love.\r\n\r\nThere was, evidently, knowledge of potions and similar excitants, for\r\none character pleads:\r\n\r\n    Tell me what varied store of balsams can I apply in my heart to\r\n    cure the wound of love.\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n    I shrink before a woman, for she shoots bright shafts from her\r\n    lovesmit countenance and pierces me with her beauty.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the sixth century A.D., Theodora, a public courtesan whose name was a\r\nbyword in Byzantium, became first the mistress and then the wife of the\r\nRoman Emperor Justinian. Even as an Empress she did not abandon her\r\nprofligate ways. She had experienced and invited every possible variety\r\nof erotic practice. She went out with bands of youths and spent the\r\nnight in their riotous company. Her erotic frenzies drove her to public\r\nexhibitionism. Often she had appeared in the theatre in puris\r\nnaturalibus. Yet her personal beauty made the Emperor her blind slave,\r\nwhile her lusts extended in every direction.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Greek chronicler Procopius describes the court of the Roman Emperor\r\nJustinian and his consort Theodora. The Imperial general attached to the\r\ncourt was Belisarius. He had a wife, named Antonina, who was so\r\npassionate that she consummated her erotic impulses, in relation to a\r\nyouth named Theodosius, in the full presence of her servants and\r\nattendant maids.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Byzantine general Belisarius, attached to the court of the Emperor\r\nJustinian, in the sixth century A.D., was again and again the victim of\r\nhis wife’s flagrant infidelities. Again and again, however, he forgave\r\nher. He permitted himself self-deception, in spite, at times, of the\r\nevidence of his own eyes. He was so deeply infatuated with her that he\r\npreferred to retain her at all costs.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Greek orator Demosthenes, in one of his famous legal speeches,\r\nsuccessfully pleaded for the death penalty in the case of one of the\r\nmistresses of the dramatist Sophocles. She was associated with a secret\r\nclub, and was initiated in the preparation of philtres and magic\r\npotions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the Greeks, the concept of love in the modern sense was rare. Nor\r\nwas the medieval attitude to amatory sensibilities, embodied in courtly\r\nlove, any more prevalent. Love, in a general sense, was treated as an\r\naberration from normal life, a kind of sickness, a lack of balance in\r\nthe elements of the entity. Yet there was, of course, as the Greek\r\nAnthology and other poetic testimony indicate, lust and passion and\r\nerotic intimacy. There was, too, a greater freedom in this relationship\r\nbetween men and public women, nor did this association affect in a\r\nnegative sense the marriage relationship.\r\n\r\nThere were these professional public hetairae, female companions who\r\noften had marked intellectual endowments, whose association with poets\r\nand dramatists, statesmen and philosophers brought not the slightest\r\nstigma on such men in their artistic or public career. Aspasia of\r\nMiletus was one of the most outstanding of this group. She was the\r\nmistress of the statesman Pericles. Gnathaena and Lais were equally\r\nknown. It was said that Plato was in love with the hetaira Archeanassa\r\nof Colophon. The comic poet Menander was associated with Glycera.\r\nPhryne, the priestess of Aphrodite, as she was termed, was the most\r\nbeautiful of them all, the model for the sculptor Praxiteles’ Aphrodite.\r\n\r\nThe seductive equipment of the hetaira was as various as in modern\r\ntimes, and as effective. It included diaphanous robes, of Coan silk,\r\nveils and scarves, mirrors and unguents and rouge, jewelry for neck and\r\nears and arms. And the hetaira replenished her armory and refurbished\r\nher memory of her techniques: for there were at hand, for her constant\r\nuse, manuals that contained guidance, amatory and financial and social,\r\nspecific instructions in a multiplicity of hypothetical but more than\r\nprobable cases, and ominous warnings as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                                 ROMANS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first century B.C. the licentiousness of the Roman matron was\r\nalready a subject for grim condemnation. Horace, who was virtually the\r\nPoet Laureate of the Augustan Age, laments the degeneration of morality.\r\nThe temples are abandoned, he bewails, and lie in ruins. The sacred\r\nmarriage vows are broken. The uprightness of the old domestic life is\r\ngone. Our own generation is plunging headlong into destruction. Against\r\nthe women in particular he inveighs as follows:\r\n\r\nThe matron, when bidden, arises and goes forth publicly, not without the\r\nknowledge of her husband, whether some pedlar invites her, or the\r\ncaptain of a Spanish sailing vessel, who buys her shame at a high price.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA notorious, unsavory district in ancient Rome was known as the Subura.\r\nIt was a valley lying between the Esquiline and the Viminal Hills of the\r\ncity. This area was clamorous with brothels, with the dregs of Romans,\r\nforeigners, slavers, pimps, and harlots. Loads of marble passed through\r\nthe narrow alleys. The lanes were cluttered with mules, dogs, goats, and\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nThere were also shops of various kinds, practically nothing but openings\r\nin the wall spaces, where provisions were sold and various delicacies.\r\nBarbers and tailors plied their occupations, while minor trades,\r\naccording to epigraphical evidence, were also conducted here. Julius\r\nCaesar himself resided in the Subura. There was also a Jewish synagogue\r\nin this district. The Subura is mentioned frequently in Roman\r\nliterature, in a derogatory and contemptuous sense, particularly by the\r\npoets Juvenal, Persius, and Martial.\r\n\r\nIn the Subura all kinds of amatory contrivances, concoctions and aids\r\nwere offered to an eager clientele: amulets, incantations, spells,\r\nphiltres, drugs; and a flourishing market in these commodities\r\nprevailed, at first furtively and warily: then with more determined and\r\nacknowledged public awareness.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Roman satirist Juvenal, who dates in the first century A.D.,\r\nmentions potions and philtres used by women; frequently, however, for\r\npurposes of torture or poisoning their husbands. Again, describing the\r\nimmoralities and licentiousness of the frantic Roman matrons of his own\r\ndays, Juvenal thunders:\r\n\r\n    From one person she secures magic incantations. From another,\r\n    she buys Thessalian love-potions to destroy her husband’s mind.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Roman poet Lucan produced an epic poem entitled _Pharsalia_. Book 6\r\ncontains a vivid, elaborate description of magic scenes and practices.\r\nThe capacities of the witch are enumerated with a feeling of mounting\r\nhorror. Her skills come in for horrendous comment: brewing concoctions\r\nfor malefic purposes: pronouncing incantations that inspire strange\r\npassions by virtue of their goetic potency. These spells, the poet\r\nawesomely declares, are more effective than even love goblets.\r\n\r\nThe implication is that love philtres were manifestly in common use for\r\namatory purposes and in common knowledge.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCertain deities were anciently associated with particular sexual\r\npractices. Volupia, an old Roman goddess mentioned by St. Augustine,\r\nencouraged voluptuous pleasures. Strenia bestowed vigor on the male.\r\nStimula aroused the erotic desires of husbands.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe practice of amatory aids, among the Romans, reached as far as the\r\nImperial court. The Emperor Julian, known as the Apostate, for instance,\r\nmentions, in a letter to his friend Callixenes, mandrake as a love\r\nagent.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn antiquity, both Greek and Roman, Medea is the arch sorceress, the\r\nsupreme exemplar of witchcraft, the most powerful adept in the Black\r\nArts of Colchis.\r\n\r\nSeneca, the Stoic philosopher and dramatist, who was also the tutor of\r\nthe Roman Emperor Nero, is the author of a drama entitled _Medea_, in\r\nwhich he depicts the protagonist herself in frenzied action.\r\n\r\nMedea’s nurse appears upon the scene, speaking of her mistress.\r\n\r\nShe describes Medea gathering potent herbs with her magic sickle, by the\r\nlight of the moon. Medea sprinkles the herbs with venom extracted from\r\nserpents. Into this compound she thrusts the entrails and organs of\r\nunclean birds: the heart of the screech owl, vampire’s vitals, torn from\r\nthe living flesh. Over the entire foul brew she murmurs her magic\r\nincantations, concocting her philtres.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn spite of the frenzied commerce in philtres and other means of\r\nstimulation, both in ancient and in modern times, Ovid himself, the\r\nRoman poet who produced the superlative amatory guides in poetic form,\r\nasserts categorically that invocations and formulas, enchantments and\r\nsorcery, secretive recipes and exotic philtres are ultimately of no\r\navail in their purpose. Even witches and enchantresses such as Medea and\r\nCirce, for all their skill in the goetic arts, could not circumvent\r\nman’s own personal perversities, or prevent Jason, for instance, or\r\nUlysses, from amatory unfaithfulness.\r\n\r\nIn the contest of love, then, concludes the poet, philtres achieve\r\nnothing but imbalanced minds, wrecked health, and, sometimes, death\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLove philtres were not infrequently fatal in their effects. Such\r\nveneficia amatoria were forbidden by imperial decree. But there were\r\nfurtive ways of circumventing these prohibitions.\r\n\r\nIngredients, apart from their poisonous nature, might be nauseating and\r\nrepulsive to administer. As an instance, the milk of an ass mixed with\r\nthe blood of a bat was considered a genesiac encouragement. The\r\ningredients, again, might induce sickness, madness, and even death.\r\n\r\nAmong known ingredients that went to form the final, putatively\r\neffective brew were herbs, organs of birds, insects, blood, and\r\ngenitalia.\r\n\r\nWith the ages, the range of ingredients and recipes was extended. In\r\nMediterranean regions old traditional amatory philtres remained in folk\r\nuse. In other areas, particularly in the South American continent, the\r\nnatives used concoctions that were often virtual poisons. For they\r\nceaselessly ransacked the forests and jungles for amatory aids.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans, the sepia octopus had a wide reputation for its\r\namatory potential. It is mentioned by the Roman comedy writer Plautus.\r\nIn a scene depicting an exhausted elder, an octopus is bought by him at\r\nthe market, as a rejuvenating aid.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his _De Re Coquinaria_, a cookery book produced by Apicius, a Roman\r\nof the first century A.D., there are many recipes for the preparation of\r\ngourmet dishes as well as less luxurious fare: fish and game, meats,\r\nvegetables, fruit, dessert, cereals.\r\n\r\nAmong the herbs that Apicius includes as ingredients in stews, roasts,\r\npottages, soups, and sauces, there are many that had and still have\r\nreputedly, an amatory reaction, as: cumin and dill, aniseed, bay-berry,\r\ncelery-seed, capers and caraway, sesame, mustard, shallots, nard, thyme,\r\nginger and musk, wormwood, basil, parsley, origanum, pennyroyal, rocket,\r\nsafflower, rue-berry, flowers of mallow, rue-seed, lovage, hyssop and\r\ngarlic and capers.\r\n\r\nMany vegetables, too, that are credited with genesiac virtue are\r\nincluded in Apicius’ book, as: artichokes and beans, asparagus, turnips,\r\ntruffles, parsnips and leeks, beets and bryony, cabbage, chicory,\r\ncucumbers, fenugreek, radishes, and lettuce.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApicius’ culinary directions and preparations include a variety of fish\r\nthat had, in Rome times and also in later ages, provocative amatory\r\nproperties. Among such piscatory agents are: Grilled red mullet, young\r\ntunny, sea-bream, murena, horse-mackerel, gold-bream. And, among sea\r\nfood: octopus and mussels, sea-urchin, oysters, cuttlefish, squid,\r\nsea-crayfish, electric ray.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn some of the fragments and extant verses of the Roman philosopher\r\nSeneca, there are illustrations of the erotic theme. In one poem the\r\npartly obliterated verses run:\r\n\r\n          Love, my darling, and be loved in turn always,\r\n          So that at no instant may our mutual love cease ...\r\n          From sunrise to sunset,\r\n          And may the Evening Star gaze\r\n          upon our love\r\n          And the Morning Star too.\r\n\r\nAn instance of abnormal lust also occurs:\r\n\r\n          Fortunate is she who caresses your neck.\r\n          Fortunate is the girl who presses close to you, body\r\n          To body,\r\n          And crushes her tongue against your soft lips.\r\n\r\nAnother fragment inveighs against a wealthy, beautiful, noble matron,\r\nlustful and incestuous.\r\n\r\nIn ancient Italy the cult of Liber or Bacchus was so widespread that\r\nfestivals held in his honor and called Liberalia were continued for an\r\nentire month. During this period the phallus, carried in procession\r\nexultantly, to the accompaniment of lewd songs, lascivious talk, and\r\nobscene gestures, was decked with garlands, while erotic acts in their\r\nfinal consummation were freely performed in public view, as reverential\r\ntestimony to the potency of the deity so symbolized.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe cult of Bacchus and of his symbol the phallus was introduced among\r\nthe Romans by the priests of Cybele, the Mighty Mother of the Gods, who\r\nwere known as Corybantes. Clement of Alexandria, the Church Father, also\r\ncalls these priests Cabiri.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Imperial Age of Rome, a certain distinguished poet, Verginius\r\nRufus, an elderly friend of Pliny the Younger, was known for his erotic\r\npoems. These, however, are no longer extant.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Imperial Rome, the professors of grammar and of rhetoric, two of the\r\nbasic subjects taught to young Romans, used many Greek and Roman authors\r\nin bowdlerized versions. In the case of the lyric poets in particular,\r\nthe suggestive and erotic elements were minimized or excised.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the Imperial Age of Rome, writers appeared at intervals who were\r\ncumulatively known as _scriptores erotici_—writers on love themes. Their\r\ntales, elaborately expanded and decked out with circumstantial details,\r\nwere concerned with the amatory adventures of mythological\r\npersonalities, among them, for instance, Acontius and Cydippe.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Roman epigrammatist Martial (c. 40 A.D.–c. 104) claimed that,\r\ndespite his obscene verses, his own personal life was unstained. He\r\nproduced a large body of epigrams and occasional poems dealing, to a\r\nvery considerable extent, with erotic and sexual topics: perversions,\r\nsodomy and incest, adultery and pederasty. His pieces mention actual\r\ncontemporary figures, and thus present a realistic and intimate picture\r\nof Roman salacious aberrations at all levels of society, as well as the\r\nerotic degeneration of the age.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Nero, with all his inhuman and vicious traits and bloody\r\ncrimes, was a versatile poet. He was the author of sportive and also\r\nerotic pieces, none of which, however, are now extant.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the rites practiced by the Romans with respect to the cult of\r\nPriapus, there was the custom of the bride who, seated before the\r\nphallic image, made at least a symbolic contact, and most commonly an\r\nactual one, with a view to encourage later marital fecundity. It was at\r\nthe same time an apotropaic measure as well. Married women were included\r\nin this ritual, and participated in similar practices. These rites,\r\ndescribed in violently condemnatory terms, are mentioned by St.\r\nAugustine and Lactantius and Arnobius, who take occasion to point out\r\nthe Roman pagan abominations in sexual matters.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith respect to the cult of Bacchus, the god himself had in his service\r\nwomen as priestesses. In the fanes dedicated to the phallic god, these\r\npriestesses celebrated nocturnal mystic rites. This practice is\r\ndescribed in some detail by Petronius, the author of the remarkable\r\nRoman picaresque novel entitled the _Satyricon_:\r\n\r\n    We had resolv’d to keep out of the broad streets, and\r\n    accordingly took our walk thro’ that quarter of the city where\r\n    we were likely to meet least company; when in a narrow winding\r\n    lane that had not passage thro’, we saw somewhat before us, two\r\n    comely matron-like women, and followed them at a distance to a\r\n    chappel, which they entred, whence we heard an odd humming kind\r\n    of noise, as if it came from the hollow of a cave: Curiosity\r\n    also made us go in after them, where we saw a number of women,\r\n    as mad as they had been sacrificing to Bacchus, and each of them\r\n    an amulet, the ensign of Bacchus, in her hand. More than that we\r\n    could not get to see; for they no sooner perceived us, that they\r\n    set up such a shout, that the roof of the temple shook agen, and\r\n    withal endeavored to lay hands on us; but we scamper’d and made\r\n    what haste we could to the inn.\r\n\r\n    Nor had we sooner stuff’d our selves with the supper Gito had\r\n    got for us, when a more than ordinary bounce at the door, put us\r\n    into another fright; and when we, pale as death, ask’d who was\r\n    there, ’twas answered, “Open the door and you’ll see.” While we\r\n    were yet talking, the bolt drop’d off, and the door flew open,\r\n    on which, a woman with her head muffl’d came in upon us, but the\r\n    same who a little before had stood by the country-man in the\r\n    market: “And what,” said she, “do you think to put a trick upon\r\n    me? I am Quartilla’s maid, whose sacred recess you so lately\r\n    disturb’d: she is at the inn-gate, and desires to speak with ye:\r\n    not that she either taxes your inadvertency, or has a mind to so\r\n    resent it, but rather wonders, what gods brought such civil\r\n    gentlemen into her quarters.”\r\n\r\n    We were silent as yet, and gave her the hearing, but inclin’d to\r\n    neither part of what she had said, when in came Quartilla her\r\n    self, attended with a young girl, and sitting down by me, fell a\r\n    weeping: nor here also did we offer a word, but stood expecting\r\n    what those tears at command meant. At last when the showre had\r\n    emptied it self, she disdainfully turn’d up her hood, and\r\n    clinching her fingers together, till the joints were ready to\r\n    crack, “What impudence,” said she, “is this? or where learnt ye\r\n    those shamms, and that sleight of hand ye have so lately been\r\n    beholding to? By my faith, young-men, I am sorry for ye; for no\r\n    one beheld what was unlawful for him to see, and went off\r\n    unpunisht: and verily our part of the town has so many deities,\r\n    you’ll sooner find a god than a man in’t: And that you may not\r\n    think I came hither to be revenged on ye, I am more concern’d\r\n    for your youth, than the injury ye have done me: for unawares,\r\n    as I yet think, ye have committed an unexpiable abomination.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans the symbol of satisfied and contented love was the\r\nmyrtle branch, offered in sacrifice, along with milk and honey, to the\r\nobscene deity Priapus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a fetish, an apotropaic periapt, protective against all kinds of\r\nmishaps, the Romans made use of an amulet in the form of a fascinum. It\r\nwas fashioned of various materials, often in the shape of a phallic\r\nsymbol in high relief, on a plaque or medallion. The object was hung\r\nround children’s necks, on garden walls, on doors, or chariots, and on\r\npublic buildings.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Roman historian Julian Capitolinus, in his biography of the Emperor\r\nPertinax, mentions glass vessels, phallic-shaped, that were used by the\r\nRomans for drinking. These vessels were known as phallovitroboli.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ithyphallic concept as the source of creation was so deeply\r\ningrained in the Roman consciousness, that they attached the ithyphallic\r\ndevice on all manner of objects: stones, seals, rings, medals, and\r\nlamps. As an extension of this concept, the Romans engraved on their\r\ndrinking vessels phallic designs, as well as lewd scenes that would\r\ncreate in the drinker violent erotic provocations.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSextus Pompeius Festus was a Roman lexicographer of the second century\r\nA.D., who describes a shrine in Rome dedicated to the obscene deities\r\nMutunus and Tutunus. In this religious cult the suppliants were women.\r\nWith head veiled, they came to offer sacrifice to the phallic powers.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lewd rites of the phallic god Bacchus were celebrated by the Romans\r\nin a sacred wood near the River Tiber. Originally open to women only,\r\nthe ceremonies were later on extended to men also, particularly to young\r\nmen not over twenty years of age. At the nocturnal rituals there was\r\nclashing of cymbals, beating of drums. After an interval of excessive\r\nwine drinking, there ensued wild scenes of sexual promiscuity and\r\nperversions unlimited. Those initiates who seemed to have any scruples\r\nwere sacrificed, and their bodies were thrown into the depths of a\r\ncavern. Men and women went frantic, shrieking their exultation to the\r\ndeity, performing abandoned dance sequences. Sinister plots and furtive\r\nmachinations also formed part of the aftermath of these tenebrous rites,\r\nmalefic in their intentions, often fatal in their effects.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn addition to Priapus as the supreme generative deity, the Romans were\r\ndedicated to a number of other divinities endowed with analogous\r\nproperties. Venus herself was worshipped at Rome in four temples.\r\n\r\nA late Latin poem, entitled Pervigilium Veneris, _The Vigil of Venus_,\r\nthe date and authorship of which are unknown, is dedicated to Venus and\r\nher spring festival. The poem itself is full of vernal descriptions. The\r\ntheme is a paean to erotic passion. Its amatory refrain, the sense of\r\nwhich pervades the entire poem, runs:\r\n\r\n               Cras amet qui numquam amavit,\r\n               Quique amavit cras amet.\r\n\r\n               He who has never loved will love tomorrow.\r\n               And he who has loved will love tomorrow.\r\n\r\nA still older deity was Flora, associated with the blossoming of plants\r\nand hence with cosmic generation. At her festival, held during the month\r\nof April, lewd farces were performed, all implicitly generative and\r\ngenesiac in intent.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most mysterious and libidinous cults in Rome was that of the\r\nBona Dea, the Good Goddess, to which women only had access. An annual\r\nceremonial was held in her honor, when a sow was sacrificed to her.\r\n\r\nJuvenal, the satiric poet, describes the excesses of the initiates.\r\nFrenzied with intoxication, overwhelmed with deafening and clamorous\r\nmusic, these women practiced the most salacious dances. In their\r\nlubricity they were athirst for erotic conflict, and were even willing,\r\nadds the poet, to submit to bestial caresses.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the Roman deities associated with marriage rites and connubial\r\nconsummations were: Stimula, who aroused the male erotic urges: Strenia,\r\nwho furnished vigor: Virginiensis, who detached the bride’s zona or\r\ngirdle: Volupia, who excited voluptuous sensations: Iugatinus, who\r\nunited the marital partners. Also Domiducus, who conducted the bride to\r\nher new home: Munturnae, who presided over her settlement in her new\r\nposition: and, more intimately involved in the physiological\r\nperformance, Liber and Libera, Pertunda, Prema, and Subigus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Romans represented the male and female genitalia in the shapes of\r\ntheir wheaten-flour loaves. The epigrammatist Martial, in Book 9, 2,\r\nalludes to this priapic custom:\r\n\r\n              Illa siligineis pinguescit adultera cunnis.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Roman poet Ovid (32 B.C.–17 A.D.) presents the ancient witch Medea\r\nin action. She invokes aid in concocting a potion to refurbish old age\r\nand induce youthful vigor:\r\n\r\n    Ye spells and arts that the wise men use; and thou, O Earth, who\r\n    dost provide the wise men with thy potent herbs; ye breezes and\r\n    winds, ye mountains and streams and pools; all ye gods of the\r\n    groves, all ye gods of the night; be with me now. With your help\r\n    I stir up the calm seas by my spell; I break the jaws of\r\n    serpents with my incantations. I bid ghosts to come forth from\r\n    their tombs. Now I have need of juices by whose aid old age may\r\n    be renewed and may turn back to the bloom of youth and regain\r\n    its earthly years.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Roman elegiac poet Tibullus (c. 48 B.C.–19 B.C.) addresses Delia,\r\nthe girl who scorned him.

What\r\n             Then said she? Yea, what said she not?\r\n             “O Night and Dian, who with true\r\n             And friendly eyes my purpose view,\r\n             And guardian silence keep, whilst I\r\n             My secret orgies safely ply,\r\n             Assist me now, now on my foes\r\n             With all your wrath celestial close!\r\n             Whilst, stretch’d in soothing sleep, amid\r\n             Their forests grim the beasts lie hid,\r\n             May all Suburra’s mongrels bark\r\n             At yon old wretch, who through the dark\r\n             Doth to his lewd encounters crawl,\r\n             And on him draw the jeers of all!\r\n             He’s with an ointment smear’d, that is\r\n             My masterpiece.

Take up with me, my pipe, the\r\n    song of Maenalus.\r\n\r\n    Maenalus it is whose forests are ever tuneful, and his pines\r\n    ever vocal; he is ever listening to the loves of shepherds, and\r\n    to Pan, the first who would not have the reeds left unemployed.\r\n    Take up with me, my pipe, the song of Maenalus.\r\n\r\n    Mopsus has Nisa given him; what may not we lovers expect to see?\r\n    Matches will be made by this between griffins and horses, and in\r\n    the age to come hounds will accompany timid does to their\r\n    draught. Mopsus, cut fresh brands for to-night; it is to you\r\n    they are bringing home a wife. Fling about nuts as a bridegroom\r\n    should; it is for you that Hesperus is leaving his rest on Oeta.\r\n    Take up with me, my pipe, the song of Maenalus.\r\n\r\n    O worthy mate of a worthy lord! There as you look down on all\r\n    the world, and are disgusted at my pipe and my goats, and my\r\n    shaggy brow, and this beard that I let grow, and do not believe\r\n    that any god cares aught for the things of men. Take up with me,\r\n    my pipe, the song of Maenalus.\r\n\r\n    It was in our enclosure I saw you gathering apples with the dew\r\n    on them. I myself showed you the way, in company with my\r\n    mother—my twelfth year had just bidden me enter on it. I could\r\n    just reach from the ground to the boughs that snapped so easily.\r\n    What a sight! what ruin to me! what a fatal frenzy swept me\r\n    away! Take up with me, my pipe, the song of Maenalus.\r\n\r\n    Now know I what love is; it is among savage rocks that he is\r\n    produced by Tmarus or Rhodope, or the Garamantes at earth’s end;\r\n    no child of lineage or blood like ours. Take up with me, my\r\n    pipe, the song of Maenalus.\r\n\r\n    Love, the cruel one, taught the mother to embrue her hands in\r\n    her children’s blood; hard too was thy heart, mother. Was the\r\n    mother’s heart harder, or the boy god’s malice more wanton?\r\n    Wanton was the boy god’s malice; hard too thy heart, mother.\r\n    Take up with me, my pipe, the song of Maenalus.\r\n\r\n    Aye, now let the wolf even run away from the sheep; let golden\r\n    apples grow out of the tough heart of oak; let narcissus blossom\r\n    on the alder; let the tamarisk’s bark sweat rich drops of amber;\r\n    rivalry let there be between swans and screech-owls; let Tityrus\r\n    become Orpheus—Orpheus in the woodland, Arion among the\r\n    dolphins. Take up with me, my pipe, the song of Maenalus.\r\n\r\n    Nay, let all be changed to the deep sea. Farewell, ye woods!\r\n    Headlong from the airy mountain’s watchtower I will plunge into\r\n    the waves; let this come to her as the last gift of the dying.\r\n    Cease, my pipe, cease at length the song of Maenalus.\r\n\r\n    Thus far Damon; for the reply of Alphesiboeus, do ye recite it,\r\n    Pierian maids; it is not for all of us to have command of all.\r\n\r\n    Bring out water and bind the altars here with a soft woolen\r\n    fillet, and burn twigs full of sap and male frankincense, that I\r\n    may try the effect of magic rites in turning my husband’s mind\r\n    from its soberness; there is nothing but charms wanting here.\r\n    Bring me home from the town, my charms, bring me my Daphnis.\r\n\r\n    Charms have power even to draw the moon down from heaven; by\r\n    charms Circe transformed the companions of Ulysses; the cold\r\n    snake as he lies in the fields is burst asunder by chanting\r\n    charms. Bring me home from the town, my charms, bring me my\r\n    Daphnis.\r\n\r\n    These three threads distinct with three colours I wind round the\r\n    first, and thrice draw the image round the altar thus; heaven\r\n    delights in an uneven number. Twine in three knots, Amaryllis,\r\n    the three colours; twine them, Amaryllis, do, and say, ‘I am\r\n    twining the bonds of Love.’ Bring me home from the town, my\r\n    charms, bring me my Daphnis.\r\n\r\n    Just as this clay is hardened, and this wax melted, by one and\r\n    the same fire, so may my love act doubly on Daphnis. Crumble the\r\n    salt cake, and kindle the crackling bay leaves with bitumen.\r\n    Daphnis, the wretch, is setting me on fire; I am setting this\r\n    bay on fire about Daphnis. Bring me home from the town, my\r\n    charms, bring me my Daphnis.\r\n\r\n    May such be Daphnis’ passion, like a heifer’s, when, weary of\r\n    looking for her mate through groves and tall forests, she throws\r\n    herself down by a stream of water on the green sedge, all\r\n    undone, and forgets to rise and make way for the fargone\r\n    night—may such be his enthralling passion, nor let me have a\r\n    mind to relieve it. Bring me home from the town, my charms,\r\n    bring me my Daphnis.\r\n\r\n    These cast-off relics that faithless one left me days ago,\r\n    precious pledges for himself, them I now entrust to thee, Earth,\r\n    burying them even on the threshold; they are bound as pledges to\r\n    give me back Daphnis. Bring me home from the town, my charms,\r\n    bring me my Daphnis.\r\n\r\n    These plants and these poisons culled from Pontus I had from\r\n    Moeris’ own hand. They grow in plenty at Pontus. By the strength\r\n    of these often I have seen Moeris turn to a wolf and plunge into\r\n    the forest, often call up spirits from the bottom of the tomb,\r\n    and remove standing crops from one field to another. Bring me\r\n    home from the town, my charms, bring me my Daphnis.\r\n\r\n    Carry the embers out of doors, Amaryllis, and fling them into\r\n    the running stream over your head, and do not look behind you.\r\n    This shall be my device against Daphnis. As for gods or charms,\r\n    he cares for none of them. Bring me home from the town, my\r\n    charms, bring me my Daphnis.\r\n\r\n    Look, look! the flickering flame has caught the altar of its own\r\n    accord, shot up from the embers, before I have had time to take\r\n    them up, all of themselves. Good luck, I trust! Can I trust\r\n    myself? Or is it that lovers make their own dreams? Stop, he is\r\n    coming from town; stop now, charms, my Daphnis!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA renewal of vigor by magic means is described in Ovid’s\r\n_Metamorphoses_. The scene involves the witch Medea, her lover Jason,\r\nand Jason’s aged father, Aeson:\r\n\r\n    Unaccompanied, she stepped uncertainly through the still silence\r\n    of midnight. Deep slumber had relaxed men and birds and wild\r\n    beasts. Without a sound, the hedges, the motionless branches lay\r\n    still. The dewy air was still. Lonely, the stars glimmered.\r\n    Thrice extending her arms, she turned toward them. Thrice,\r\n    taking some water, she copiously bedewed her locks. Thrice she\r\n    uttered howls from her lips. Then, on bent knee, touching the\r\n    hard ground, she said:\r\n\r\n    “O night, most propitious for mysteries, and you, golden stars,\r\n    that, along with the moon, follow the fiery day, and you, triple\r\n    Hecate, who, aware of our undertaking come forth to help in\r\n    incantation and magic art, and you, Earth, who teach magicians\r\n    the potency of herbs, and you, zephyrs and winds and hills and\r\n    streams and lakes, and all you gods of the groves, be my aid. By\r\n    your aid, when I so willed, the streams returned to their\r\n    springs to the astonishment of the river banks, and by your aid\r\n    I stay the upturned waters and upheave the stagnant straits by\r\n    spells, and I drive away the clouds and bring them back, and\r\n    banish and summon the winds and break the jaws of snakes with my\r\n    words and spells, and move natural rocks and trees uprooted from\r\n    the ground and forests and I bid the mountains tremble and the\r\n    ground rumble, and the spirits of the dead arise from the tomb.\r\n    You also, O Moon, I draw down, and Helios’ chariot too pales at\r\n    my incantation. The Dawn grows pale with my poisons. All of you\r\n    have quenched the flames of the oxen for me and pressed their\r\n    necks, reluctant for the task, under the crooked plough. You\r\n    brought wars upon the serpent-born warriors and sleep upon the\r\n    grim guardian.\r\n\r\n    Now there is need of juices whereby old age revived may bloom\r\n    once more, and regain its former years. And you deities will\r\n    grant this request—for not in vain is the chariot at hand, drawn\r\n    by winged dragons.”\r\n\r\nThere was the chariot, sent from high heaven. No sooner had she mounted\r\nand soothed the frenzied necks of the dragons and shaken the reins\r\nlightly with her hands than she was whisked off aloft, and beheld the\r\nherbs growing on Mount Ossa and lofty Pelion and Othrys and Pindus and\r\nOlympus greater than Pindus. She plucked out suitable herbs by the root,\r\nand some she cut away with the curved blade of a bronze sickle. The\r\nherbs that grew thick on the banks of the Apidanus caught her fancy too\r\nand those on the banks of the Amphrysus. Nor were you overlooked,\r\nEnipeus: and the Peneus and the waters of the Spercheus contributed\r\ntheir quota, and the reedy banks of the Boebeis. Medea gathered too the\r\nsturdy grasses in Euboean Anthedon. And now when the ninth day had seen\r\nher traversing all the fields in her winged-dragon chariot, she\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nAs she advanced, she halted at the threshold and the gate, and stood\r\nunder the sky. And she shunned contacts with men: and set up two altars\r\nof turf, on the right of Hecate, on the left of Youth. After she had\r\nwreathed them with vervain and wild foliage, close by she made a\r\nsanctuary by means of two ditches, and pierced the throat of a black ram\r\nwith the sacrificial knife, and soaked the wide ditches in the blood.\r\n\r\nThen she poured over it a beaker of flowing wine and a bronze beaker of\r\nwarm milk and at the same time murmured words over it, and called upon\r\nthe divinities of the earth, and begged the King of the Lower Regions\r\nand his stolen wife not to hasten to rob the limbs of the aged soul.\r\n\r\nWhen she had propitiated them with prayer and many a chant, she bade\r\nthat the exhausted body of Aeson be carried out of doors, and on the\r\nstrewn herbs she extended the lifeless shape, relaxed by incantation in\r\ndeep slumber. She bade Aeson’s son stand clear away, and the attendants\r\ntoo, and she admonished them to withdraw their profane sight from the\r\nmysteries. So bidden, they scattered in different directions. With\r\ndisheveled hair, like a Bacchante, Medea encircled the blazing altars.\r\nShe dipped finely split torches in the dark pool of gore, and lighted\r\nthe bloody brands on the two altars. Thrice she encircled the aged body\r\nwith fire, thrice with water, thrice with sulphur.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the potent drug boiled in the bronze kettle and leapt and\r\nwhitened in the swelling froth. She threw in roots cut in Thessalian\r\nvalley and seeds and blossoms and pungent spices. She added pebbles\r\nsecured from the remote East and sands washed by the refluent Ocean\r\nstream. She added too the frost caught in the full moon and the baleful\r\nwings of a screech-owl together with the flesh itself, and the entrails\r\nof a werewolf wont to change its animal form into a man. Nor was there\r\nlacking the scaly skin of a water-serpent, the liver of a living stag.\r\nIn addition, she threw in the head of a crow nine centuries old. By\r\nthese and a thousand other unspeakable means she planned to delay the\r\ndestined function of Tartarus. With a dry twig of long softened olive\r\nshe stirred all the ingredients together, turning them over from top to\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nBehold now the old twig stirring in the boiling kettle first turned\r\ngreen, and presently put forth leaves, and suddenly became loaded with\r\nheavy olives. But wherever the fire belched out foam from the hollow\r\nkettle and the drops fell hot on the ground, the soil grew fresh, and\r\nflowers and soft grass sprang up.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she beheld this sight, with drawn sword Medea pierced the\r\naged man’s throat and, allowing the old blood to exude, filled the spot\r\nwith juices. After Aeson had drunk them, either with his lips or through\r\nhis wound, his beard and hair, shedding their greyness, quickly assumed\r\na dark color. The emaciation vanished, and the pallor and decay\r\ndisappeared, and the hollow wrinkles were filled up in the fresh body,\r\nand the limbs grew rapidly.\r\n\r\nAeson stood amazed, recalling that this was how he was forty years back.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPetronius, who belongs in the first century A.D., produced a remarkable\r\nnovel entitled _The Satyricon_, in which he describes an instance of\r\nrenewed virility by means of witchcraft:\r\n\r\n    “This is the custom, Sir,” said she, “and chiefly of this City,\r\n    where the women are skill’d in Magick-charms, enough to make the\r\n    Moon confess their power, therefore the recovery of any useful\r\n    Instrument of Love becomes their care; ’tis only writing some\r\n    soft tender things to my Lady, and you make her happy in a kind\r\n    return. For ’tis confest, since her Disappointment, she has not\r\n    been her self.”\r\n\r\n    I readily consented, and calling for Paper, thus addrest myself:\r\n\r\n    “’Tis confest, Madam, I have often sinned, for I’m not only a\r\n    Man, but a very young one, yet never left the Field so\r\n    dishonorably before. You have at your Feet a confessing\r\n    Criminal, that deserves whatever you inflict: I have cut a\r\n    Throat, betray’d my Country, committed Sacrilege; if a\r\n    punishment for any of these will serve, I am ready to receive\r\n    sentence. If you fancy my death, I wait you with my Sword; but\r\n    if a beating will content you, I fly naked to your Arms. Only\r\n    remember, that ’twas not the Workman, but his Instruments that\r\n    fail’d: I was ready to engage, but wanted Arms. Who rob’d me of\r\n    them I know not; perhaps my eager mind outrun my body; or while\r\n    with an unhappy haste I aim’d at all; I was cheated with\r\n    Abortive joys. I only know I don’t know what I’ve done: You bid\r\n    me fear a Palsie, as if the Disease cou’d do greater that has\r\n    already rob’d me of that, by which I shou’d have purchas’d you.\r\n    All I have to say for my self, is this, that I will certainly\r\n    pay with interest the Arrears of Love, if you allow me time to\r\n    repair my misfortune.”\r\n\r\n    Having sent back Chrysis with this Answer, to encourage my jaded\r\n    Body, after the Bath and Strengthening Oyles, had a little\r\n    rais’d me, I apply’d my self to strong meats, such as strong\r\n    Broths and Eggs, using Wine very moderately; upon which to\r\n    settle my self, I took a little Walk, and returning to my\r\n    Chamber, slept that night without Gito; so great was my care to\r\n    acquit my self honourably with my Mistress, that I was afraid he\r\n    might have tempted my constancy, by tickling my Side.\r\n\r\n    The next day rising without prejudice, either to my body or\r\n    spirits, I went, tho’ I fear’d the place was ominous, to the\r\n    same Walk, and expected Chrysis to conduct me to her Mistress; I\r\n    had not been long there, e’re she came to me, and with her a\r\n    little Old Woman. After she had saluted me, “What, my nice Sir\r\n    Courtly,” said she, “does your Stomach begin to come to you?”\r\n\r\n    At what time, the Old Woman, drawing from her bosome, a wreath\r\n    of many colours, bound my Neck; and having mixt spittle and\r\n    dust, she dipt her finger in’t, and markt my Fore-head, whether\r\n    I wou’d or not.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Rome the inns—the tabernae, the popinae, and the ganea—were\r\nvirtually, in addition to their primary purpose in serving drink, houses\r\nof prostitution and assignation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn wedding celebrations among the Romans, ribald and licentious songs\r\nplayed no mean part. These songs were known as Fescennini Versus, and\r\nwere believed to have apotropaic significance, while they also recalled\r\nthe primary purpose of the nuptial union.\r\n\r\nAt harvest festivals similar lewd verses were exchanged between masked\r\nperformers.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs visual guides to the lupanaria in ancient Rome, there were lighted\r\nlamps, of phallic shape, near the doors. Seneca the philosopher refers\r\nto this custom. Also the poet Juvenal in the sixth satire:\r\n\r\n                                      fumoque lucernae\r\n                  Foeda lupanaris\r\n\r\nAn old commentator adds: Prostabant autem meretrices ad lucernas.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAcca Larentia was a Roman goddess whose festival—the Larentalia or\r\nLarentinalia—fell on December 23. The tradition was that she herself had\r\nbeen a prostitute. Her festival was a fertility ritual, as in the case\r\nof Lupa and Flora.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a tradition that the Emperor Heliogabalus sponsored a brothel\r\nin Rome called Senatulus Mulierum: The Little Senate of Women.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNonariae were public prostitutes in Rome who were not allowed to appear\r\nbefore the ninth hour. The satirist Persius refers to this custom:\r\n\r\n               Si Cynico barbam petulans Nonaria vellat.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ancients believed that the feminine lips had some relation to the\r\ngenitalia: and likewise that a prominent nose indicated a corresponding\r\nmembrum virile. There is evidence of this view in a short epigram by the\r\nRoman poet Martial:\r\n\r\n             Mentula tam magna est quantus tibi, Papyle,\r\n             nasus, ut possis, quotiens arrigis, olfacere.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ovid_\r\n\r\nOne of the richest sources of eroticism is the Roman poet Publius\r\nOvidius Naso, commonly called in English Ovid. Born in 43 B.C., he\r\nreached the greatest literary and social heights of his time, but,\r\nfalling under imperial disfavor, he ended his life in bleak and desolate\r\nbanishment.\r\n\r\nAt Rome he acquired a deep knowledge of rhetoric, both academic and\r\napplied, and then continued his studies in Athens. As was then usual, he\r\nsubsequently made the grand tour of the East. Although he was destined,\r\nby his family’s wishes, for a career in law, Ovid dedicated himself to\r\nhis supreme and exclusive love, the poetic Muse.\r\n\r\nHis output was tremendous. He addressed a certain Corinna in a series of\r\nlove elegies. He wrote fictional poetic letters of enamoured women. His\r\n_Metamorphoses_ describes strange changes undergone by mortals and\r\ndivinities in pursuit of love. His Love Letters of Heroines, Directions\r\nfor a Lady’s Cosmetic Preparations, the Art of Love, and the Remedies\r\nfor Love belong in a common category.\r\n\r\nThe principal climactic situation in his life was his banishment, by the\r\nimperial mandate of the Emperor Augustus, to the desolation of Tomis, on\r\nthe Black Sea. He had to abandon his wife and home—he had been married\r\nthree times—, his literary friends, and his social circle. It was a kind\r\nof living death, a spiritual and intellectual cataclysm. At Tomis, a\r\nwild, barbaric, inhospitable spot, Ovid spent the remaining years of his\r\nlife, in regret and supplications fruitlessly addressed to the Emperor,\r\nand in writing, particularly his _Tristia_, Sad Themes.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the banishment is still obscure, although Ovid himself\r\nhints at a ‘poem and a blunder.’ The poem was his Art of Love, which was\r\nfrowned upon imperially and excluded from the public libraries in the\r\nRoman capital. The blunder of which Ovid was apparently guilty was\r\nassociated, as he declares, with his possession of eyes—that is, he may\r\nhave been a spectator or observer of some adulterous act involving the\r\nimperial family. Whatever the factual reason, the Emperor remained\r\nobdurate to the poet’s pleas, and Ovid died in exile.\r\n\r\nIn the voluminous corpus of poetic accomplishment, Ovid produced many\r\nmajor contributions to erotic literature. His _Ars Amatoria_ is a\r\nuniversal handbook to love and its manifestations. His _Amores_ is a\r\nsequence of amorous vignettes. His _Remedia Amoris_, Remedies for Love,\r\nconstitutes a body of amatory expiations that in spite of their negative\r\ntone are as voluptuously and cynically libidinous as his forthright\r\nprescriptions. In all, here is a body of themes, views, techniques that\r\nexpound the most intimate secrets of the boudoir and the salon, of the\r\nentire range of erotic manifestations. Among his known contemporaries\r\nOvid became a kind of arch-consultant in love, the ultimate arbiter of\r\ndalliance, the poetic confessor of sensual delights. And continuously\r\nthrough the ages his poetic presentations, descriptions, enumerations,\r\nhis almost legalized counsel in debauchery, translated into most\r\nEuropean languages, have served as a final, authoritative, cynical and\r\nlibidinous source book.\r\n\r\nOvid probes into both normal and perverted forms of amatory experience,\r\nand reveals in vivid and not infrequently lurid detail, the\r\nsophisticated gallantries, the urbane wantonness, the suave and polished\r\nsalaciousness, and the cultivated prurience of the Roman capital during\r\nthe first century before the Christian era.\r\n\r\nIn respect of the means of inspiring and promoting amatory activity,\r\nboth in men and women, Ovid has many pointed things to say about\r\npotions. In Latin, the _poculum amatorium_ is the common expression used\r\nto designate the potion, that is, the love-goblet.\r\n\r\nOvid’s primary theme, in these exciting productions of his, is: Love is\r\na campaign, long and ruthless. It requires skill, training, equipment,\r\nstrategy, vision. So, in his pleas to Corinna his poetic offerings are\r\nin the nature of addresses to Woman, tantalizing, shameless, an epitome\r\nof feminine wiles and graces.\r\n\r\nAs stimuli toward erotic diversions, Ovid generously and without\r\nresentment recommends, in addition to his own poetic manuals, his Roman\r\ncontemporaries Propertius and Tibullus, the elegiac poets, as well as\r\nVergil: and, among the Greeks, the erotic lyrics and occasional pieces\r\nof Callimachus and Philetas, Anacreon and Sappho.\r\n\r\nIn Book 3 of the _Metamorphoses_ we have the story of Narcissus,\r\nenamoured aphrodisiacally by his own image reflected in a pool. The\r\nimage of himself is so clearly defined, the lips move so appealingly in\r\nresponse to his own pleas, that he is ready to succumb amorously. Then\r\nhe realizes the truth, that he and his reflection are one, his own self,\r\nhis very identity. And he longs to free himself from himself, to escape\r\nthe duplication. By this imaginative and symbolical mythological design,\r\nOvid is unquestionably stressing the erotic passion itself, the frenzied\r\necstasy to detach oneself from one’s own being, the clamor of man\r\nagainst his fettered self and his erotic agonies.\r\n\r\nA potion may appear in various guises. A vision of beauty can itself act\r\nlike an enriched, stimulating philtre. The enraptured glance sends its\r\nerotic pronouncement to the enraptured heart, and the potion is\r\nvirtually consummated. So, it seemed to Ovid, was the strange episode\r\ninvolving the sculptor Pygmalion:\r\n\r\n       Pygmalion loathing their lascivious life,\r\n       Abhorr’d all womanhood, but most a wife:\r\n       So single chose to live, and shunn’d to wed,\r\n       Well pleas’d to want a consort of his bed.\r\n       Yet fearing idleness, the nurse of ill,\r\n       In sculpture exercis’d his happy skill;\r\n       And carv’d in iv’ry such a maid, so fair,\r\n       As nature could not with his art compare,\r\n       Were she to work; but in her own defence,\r\n       Must take her patterns here, and copy hence.\r\n       Pleas’d with his idol, he commends, admires,\r\n       Adores; and last, the thing ador’d, desires.\r\n       A very virgin in her face was seen,\r\n       And had she mov’d, a living maid had been:\r\n       One wou’d have thought she could have stirr’d; but strove\r\n       With modesty, and was asham’d to move.\r\n       Art hid with art, so well perform’d the cheat,\r\n       It caught the carver with his own deceit:\r\n       He knows ’tis madness, yet he must adore,\r\n       And still the more he knows it, loves the more:\r\n       The flesh, or what so seems, he touches oft,\r\n       Which feels so smooth, that he believes it soft.\r\n       Fir’d with this thought, at once he strain’d the breast,\r\n       And on the lips a burning kiss impress’d.\r\n       ’Tis true, the harden’d breast resists the gripe,\r\n       And the cold lips return a kiss unripe:\r\n       But when, retiring back, he look’d again,\r\n       To think it iv’ry, was a thought too mean:\r\n       So wou’d believe she kiss’d, and courting more,\r\n       Again embrac’d her naked body o’er;\r\n       And straining hard the statue, was afraid\r\n       His hands had made a dint, and hurt his maid:\r\n       Explor’d her, limb by limb, and fear’d to find\r\n       So rude a gripe had left a livid mark behind:\r\n       With flatt’ry now he seeks her mind to move,\r\n       And now with gifts, (the pow’rful bribes of love:)\r\n       He furnishes her closet first; and fills\r\n       The crowded shelves with rarities of shells;\r\n       Adds orient pearls, which from the conch he drew,\r\n       And all the sparkling stones of various hue:\r\n       And parrots, imitating human tongue,\r\n       And singing-birds in silver cages hung;\r\n       And ev’ry fragrant flow’r, and od’rous green,\r\n       Were sorted well, with lumps of amber laid between:\r\n       Rich, fashionable robes her person deck:\r\n       Pendants her ears, and pearls adorn her neck:\r\n       Her taper’d fingers too with rings are grac’d,\r\n       And an embroider’d zone surrounds her slender waist.\r\n       Thus like a queen array’d, so richly dress’d,\r\n       Beauteous she shew’d, but naked shew’d the best.\r\n       Then, from the floor, he rais’d a royal bed,\r\n       With cov’rings of Sidonian purple spread:\r\n       The solemn rites perform’d, he calls her bride,\r\n       With blandishments invites her to his side,\r\n       And as she were with vital sense possess’d,\r\n       Her head did on a plumy pillow rest.\r\n       The feast of Venus came, a solemn day,\r\n       To which the Cypriots due devotion pay;\r\n       With gilded horns the milk-white heifers led,\r\n       Slaughter’d before the sacred altars, bled:\r\n       Pygmalion off’ring, first approach’d the shrine,\r\n       And then with pray’rs implor’d the pow’rs divine:\r\n       “Almighty gods, if all we mortals want,\r\n       If all we can require, be yours to grant;\r\n       Make this fair statue mine,” he would have said,\r\n       But chang’d his words for shame; and only pray’d,\r\n       “Give me the likeness of my iv’ry maid.”\r\n       The golden goddess, present at the pray’r,\r\n       Well knew he meant th’inanimated fair,\r\n       And gave the sign of granting his desire;\r\n       For thrice in cheerful flames ascends the fire.\r\n       The youth, returning to his mistress, hies,\r\n       And, impudent in hope, with ardent eyes,\r\n       And beating breast, by the dear statue lies.\r\n       He kisses her white lips, renews the bliss,\r\n       And looks and thinks they redden at the kiss:\r\n       He thought them warm before: nor longer stays,\r\n       But next his hand on her hard bosom lays:\r\n       Hard as it was, beginning to relent,\r\n       It seem’d, the breast beneath his fingers bent;\r\n       He felt again, his fingers made a print,\r\n       ’Twas flesh, but flesh so firm, it rose against the dint:\r\n       The pleasing task he fails not to renew;\r\n       Soft, and more soft at ev’ry touch it grew;\r\n       Like pliant wax, when chafing hands reduce\r\n       The former mass to form, and frame for use\r\n       He would believe, but yet is still in pain,\r\n       And tries his argument of sense again,\r\n       Presses the pulse, and feels the leaping vein.\r\n       Convinc’d, o’erjoy’d, his studied thanks and praise,\r\n       To her who made the miracle, he pays:\r\n       Then lips to lips he join’d; now freed from fear,\r\n       He found the savor of the kiss sincere:\r\n       At this the waken’d image op’d her eyes,\r\n       And view’d at once the light and lover, with surprise.\r\n       The goddess present at the match she made,\r\n       So bless’d the bed, such fruitfulness convey’d,\r\n       That e’er ten moons had sharpen’d either horn,\r\n       To crown their bliss, a lovely boy was born;\r\n       Paphos his name, who, grown to manhood, wall’d\r\n             The city Paphos, from the founder call’d.\r\n\r\nThe realism of the sculptured figure, together with the aroused passion\r\nof the artist, produced a kind of symbiotic philtre, a flaming, kinetic\r\nperiapt.\r\n\r\nIn Book 1 of the _Ars Amatoria_ Ovid introduces his basic subject: love\r\nunrestrained, Aphrodite Pandemos, patroness of free love, of passion\r\nunconfined:\r\n\r\n             Far hence, ye Vestals, be, who bind your hair;\r\n             And wives, who gowns below your ankles wear.\r\n             I sing the brothels loose and unconfin’d,\r\n             Th’unpunishable pleasures of the kind;\r\n             Which all alike, for love, or money find.\r\n\r\nAnd, in a brief preface, he offers an epitome of early Roman history,\r\nwhich is equated succinctly with military prowess and sexual prowess:\r\n\r\n             Thus Romulus became so popular;\r\n             This was the way to thrive in peace and war;\r\n             To pay his army, and fresh whores to bring:\r\n             Who wou’d not fight for such a gracious king!\r\n\r\nNow Ovid dwells on wine as an amatory stimulant, a virtual flaming\r\npotion:\r\n\r\n              But thou, when flowing cups in triumph ride,\r\n              And the lov’d nymph is seated by thy side;\r\n              Invoke the God, and all the mighty pow’rs,\r\n              That wine may not defraud thy genial hours.\r\n              Then in ambiguous words thy suit prefer;\r\n              Which she may know were all addrest to her.\r\n\r\nPractice all the variations conceivable in winning your designated\r\nconquest, Ovid advises recurrently. Your wit and suavity will prevail:\r\nfar more, in fact, than artificial aids, such as philtres. Philtres,\r\nOvid asserts from the richness of his erotic experience, are futile in\r\nthe contests of love:\r\n\r\n    Pallid philtres given to girls were of no avail. Philtres harm\r\n    the mind and produce an impact of madness.\r\n\r\nHe enumerates many items that were popularly reputed to possess\r\naphrodisiac properties. But you should shun them, he reiterates, for\r\ntheir effect is minimal. Hippomanes, the excrescence on a new-born colt,\r\nis ineffectual: similarly with the traditional magic herbs purchased\r\nfurtively from some wizened old hag. Reject, equally, formulas for\r\nexorcism and similar enchantments. The best love philtre, in short, is\r\nthe lover’s own passion. Even the ancient enchantress Circe, whom Homer\r\ndescribes so vividly, could not, by the aid of her occult devices,\r\nprevent the unfaithfulness of Ulysses: nor could the tumultuous Medea,\r\npracticed in the lore of the sorceress, combat the waywardness of Jason.\r\n\r\nIt is true, the poet acknowledges, that in the popular mind many\r\nobjects, grasses, roots are associated with the virtues of the love\r\npotion: but erroneously so, he adds. He lists the items as follows:\r\n\r\n           Some teach that herbs will efficacious prove,\r\n           But in my judgment such things poison love.\r\n           Pepper with biting nettle-seed they bruise,\r\n           With yellow pellitory wine infuse.\r\n           Venus with such as this no love compels,\r\n           Who on the shady hill of Eryx dwells.\r\n           Eat the white shallots sent from Megara\r\n           Or garden herbs that aphrodisiac are,\r\n           Or eggs, or honey on Hymettus flowing,\r\n           Or nuts upon the sharp-leaved pine-trees growing.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMorality, especially sexual morality, descended to its most degenerative\r\nnadir in the period of the Roman Empire. The poets and satirists, the\r\nhistorians and the moralists all uniformly fulminate against the\r\nprofligacies of Roman matrons, particularly in the upper social levels\r\nand in the court circles, and blast and condemn the utter\r\nlicentiousness, lewdness, and abandonment of all restraints.\r\n\r\nSeneca the philosopher asserts:\r\n\r\n    Anything assailed by countless desires is insecure. And the\r\n    young and even more mature matrons, descendants of distinguished\r\n    figures in the tumultuous sequence of Roman history, were\r\n    exposed to every kind of inducement to laxity, every urgent\r\n    temptation, domestically, publicly, and politically. There was a\r\n    vogue of indiscriminate flirtation, highly skilled, ingeniously\r\n    practiced, that led into violent passion and into adultery, into\r\n    incest and multiple perversions. Lust became the primary\r\n    satisfaction, and its consummation was the most common, the most\r\n    clamant factor in the social frame.\r\n\r\nEven the earlier days of the Roman Republic were, as the poet Horace\r\ndeclares—and he was the Augustan Poet Laureate—‘rich in sin.’ Propertius\r\ntoo confirms this view, and goes one step further. The sea, he suggests,\r\nwill be dried up and the stars torn from heaven before women reform\r\ntheir immoral ways.\r\n\r\nThe entire nation, rich and prosperous, masters of the universe,\r\noverwhelmed and sated with exotic luxuries, attended, for their every\r\nwhim, by hordes of slaves, had lost all human modesty, all human\r\nvirtues. Yet all was not entirely lost, for voices cried out, however\r\nfeebly and helplessly, in the midst of their successions of wantonness\r\nand orgies.\r\n\r\nThe poet Ovid wryly says:\r\n\r\n    Only those women are chaste who are unsolicited, and a man who\r\n    is enraged at his wife’s amours is merely a boor.\r\n\r\nSeneca says again, in respect of married women: A woman who is content\r\nto have two lovers only is a paragon.\r\n\r\nFor adultery and divorce were the usual recreations of many Roman\r\nmatrons in Imperial times. Marriage itself was often a mere formality,\r\nand it implied no loyalties, no honor. Some women, declares Seneca,\r\ncounted the years not by the consuls, but by the number of husbands they\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nAnd the Church Father, Tertullian, added later, in the same vein: Women\r\nmarry, only to divorce. Ovid himself, the archpoet of love, was married\r\nthree times. Caesar had four wives in succession. Mark Antony also had\r\nfour. Sulla the statesman and Pompey each had five wives. Pliny the\r\nYounger had three wives. Martial the epigrammatist mentions a certain\r\nPhileros who had seven wives.\r\n\r\nWomen were no better, no less restless. Tullia, Cicero’s daughter, had\r\nthree husbands. The Emperor Nero was the third husband of Poppaea, and\r\nthe fifth of Messalina. The poet Martial refers to a woman who had eight\r\nhusbands, and to another who was suspected of murdering her seven\r\nhusbands, one after the other.\r\n\r\nEvery passion, every illicit amour, was a provocation to the Roman\r\nwomen. They had intrigues with their slaves, with actors and\r\npantomimists, with jockeys, charioteers, gladiators, and flute-players.\r\n\r\nRoman temples were rendez-vous, and prostitution and adultery were\r\npracticed among the altars and in the cells that were heavy with\r\nincense. In a striking passage, Tertullian personifies Idolatry, who\r\nconfesses: My sacred groves of pilgrimage, my mountains and springs, my\r\ncity temples, all know how I corrupt chastity.\r\n\r\nAstrological and magic techniques contributed to the already degenerate\r\nRomans of the Empire. Old hags practiced procuring and other dubious\r\ntrades. They prepared drugs and potions and salves for beauty and\r\npassion and poisoning. In time, these practices assumed a mysterious\r\naura. They absorbed the secret cults of the Nile and the Ganges and the\r\nEuphrates. Some of the practitioners were actually reputable, dignified,\r\neagerly sought after by women. Lucian describes a certain Alexander of\r\nAbonuteichos—stately, with well-trimmed beard, penetrating look,\r\nmodulated voice. He wore a wig of flowing locks. He was dressed in a\r\nwhite and purple tunic, and a white cloak, and in his hand he carried a\r\nscythe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n                                 ORIENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAncient Hindu literature treats in startling detail every conceivable\r\naspect of erotic manifestations. There are guides and manuals and\r\nelaborate treatises and monographs devoted to particular topics: to\r\ncoital procedures, to male and female characteristics and tendencies, to\r\nstrange stimuli, and to amatory potions and philtres. Of all these\r\nmanuals possibly the Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana Malanaga, who is presumed\r\nto belong in the fourth century A.D., is the best known. It is, in fact,\r\nthe most widely disseminated treatise on all phases of erotic practices.\r\n\r\nThe Kama Sutra furnishes specific information on the techniques of\r\nsexual relationships, the virtues and defects of women, the degrees of\r\nsensuality among both men and women, the criteria of beauty and\r\nattractiveness, the most effective devices in the matter of dress and\r\nhair arrangement, foods and cosmetics, perfumes, and the symbolic\r\nlanguage of love.\r\n\r\nIt also stresses potions, their component elements, their preparation,\r\nand the type of philtres that are most favorable to the erotic\r\nsensibilities.\r\n\r\nThe Hindu manuals also make special classifications of women according\r\nto the degree and durability of their erotic sensations, their physical\r\nappearance, and the osphresiological conditions arising from the pudenda\r\nmuliebria. Nothing is secretive, nothing is taboo. The primary and\r\nuniversal activity, it is assumed, necessitates wide and deep and exact\r\nand revelatory knowledge, so that the man or woman may function to the\r\nfullest and most complete extent.\r\n\r\nThe male is also subjected to analysis, in an amatory direction,\r\naccording to physiological and erotic categories. The most personal, the\r\nmost intimate, the most normally cryptic and unspoken matters are\r\nsubjected to forthright description and comment. For example, one\r\nsubject discussed with the utmost candor is the intensity of the male\r\nerotic potential and his general reactions to sexual conjugation.\r\n\r\nEmbraces and their varieties of erotic significance, postures and\r\ndegrees of proximity and physiological contiguity come under observation\r\nand exposition. Especially the thirteen types of kissing, each in its\r\nown way symptomatic of the intensity of the passion. The art of kissing\r\nwas itself so important in both ancient classical and Asiatic eroticism\r\nthat, in the Middle Ages, it reached a literary climax. Johannes\r\nSecundus, a Dutch scholar, wrote a passionate amatory sequence of Latin\r\npoems entitled _Basia_, Kisses, in which he exceeded the lyrical surge\r\nand sway and the pulsating exultation of the Roman poet Catullus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the course of his surgical and medical experiences in various\r\ncountries, notably in the Orient, Dr. Jacobus X, the French army surgeon\r\nwho is the author of a voluminous corpus of anthropological matter\r\nentitled _Untrodden Fields of Anthropology_ (2 volumes. Paris: Published\r\nby Charles Carrington: 2nd. edition, 1898), the author gathered a great\r\ndeal of unique and miscellaneous and little known information on sexual\r\npractices. In discussing potions, he dwells on cubeb pepper, a popular\r\nitem in the love philtres of the East.\r\n\r\nA drink in which the leaves of cubeb pepper have been steeped, according\r\nto Dr. Jacobus, produces pronounced genital excitation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Arabs were astoundingly prolific in producing manuals on erotic\r\nthemes, ranging over the entire field of sexual practices, normal and\r\nperverted, to which man is physiologically bound.\r\n\r\nThe attitude adopted in such handbooks, however, is free from the\r\ncontrived prurient or lascivious tone that might possibly have been\r\nexpected, particularly in relation to occidental erotic literature.\r\nThere is apparent, on the contrary, a certain reverential humility, as\r\nof one who treats a sacred subject for which supreme gratitude is to be\r\naccorded to the ultimate and beneficent Maker. In this sense, therefore,\r\nerotic matters have inherently a sanctity that is acknowledged by the\r\nArab writers again and again. As in the case of the Sheikh Nefzawi’s\r\n_The Perfumed Garden_. Or in the amorous episodes that pervade the\r\ncorpus of tales of the _Arabian Nights_. Or in the _Book of Exposition\r\nin the Science of Coition_, attributed to a certain theologian and\r\nhistorian named Jalal al-Din al-Siyuti. Many Arab erotic treatises\r\nactually introduce the subject with a devout invocation to Allah as the\r\ncreator and dispenser of such beatific and voluptuous pleasures as are\r\ndetailed in the text.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn one specific instance the Sheikh Nefzawi, after describing a\r\npreparation for correcting amatory impairment, adds: This preparation\r\nwill make the weakness disappear and effect a cure, with the permission\r\nof God the Highest.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Chinese amatory concoction, whose base was opium, was known as affion.\r\nReputedly, it had decided erotic effects: which, however, were of an\r\nintensely violent nature accompanied by flagrant brutality. The fact of\r\nopium as a major ingredient, however, was evidently an inducement to its\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOften small creatures, insects, reptiles, formed the base of amatory\r\nphiltres. In Africa, for example, the amphibious animal that belonged to\r\nthe lizard species and was named lacerta scincus was anciently ground\r\ninto powder and taken as a beverage.\r\n\r\nThis concoction was considered an aphrodisiac of remarkable potency.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA cogently recommended prescription in the famous Hindu manual, the\r\nAnanga-Ranga, consists of the juice of the plant bhuya-Kokali, dried in\r\nthe sun, and mixed with ghee or clarified butter, honey, and candied\r\nsugar. This potion, it is urged, is taken with great pleasurable\r\nanticipation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Arabia, a highly recommended beverage, designed to strengthen and\r\nmaintain amatory energy, is camel’s milk in which honey has been poured.\r\nThe prescription requires consecutive and regular application.\r\n\r\nIdentical in intent, and somewhat similar in ingredients, is a kind of\r\nbroth prescribed by the Sheikh Nefzawi, the erotologist. It consists of\r\nonion juices, together with purified honey. This mixture is heated until\r\nonly the consistency of the honey remains. Then it is cooled, water is\r\nadded, and finally pounded chick-peas. To be taken in a small dose,\r\nadvises Nefzawi, during cold spells of weather, and before retiring to\r\nbed, and for one day only. The result, he promises, will be startlingly\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Turkish recipe recommends olibanum, which is frankincense, mixed with\r\nrose water, along with camphor, myrrh, and musk, all pounded and\r\nfricated together. The resultant mixture is sealed hermetically in a\r\nglass. Then it is left for a day or two in the sun. Now the preparation\r\nis ready for use: as a spray over the hands in washing, or on the body,\r\nor on the clothing, with consequent impacts on the person and on the\r\nerotogenic areas.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Orient, honey normally and regularly takes the place occupied by\r\nsugar in Western countries. Hence honey is a common ingredient in many\r\nfoods, pastries and drinks. Basically, it appears repeatedly in\r\nprescriptions designed as love-potions. It is, to take an instance,\r\nfrequently mentioned by Avicenna, the eleventh century Arab philosopher,\r\nphysician, and libertine, as well as by the erotologist the Sheikh\r\nNefzawi. Honey, compounded with pepper, or with ginger, or with cubebs,\r\nin various proportions and variously formed into a consistent brew, is a\r\nstandard recipe in the amatory pharmacopoeia of the East.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIndian manuals on erotology contain many directions, suggestions, and\r\nspecific prescriptions relative to the increase of masculine potency.\r\nSome of these prescriptions advise rare or unobtainable herbs. Others\r\nare hazardous, and may occasion dangerous reactions. Some are merely\r\nhumorously and naively fantastic and impossible or futile of\r\nrealization: while occasional recommendations may be warranted and may\r\nhave some amatory validity.\r\n\r\nA drink consisting of milk, with sugar added and the root of the\r\nuchchata plant, piper chaba, which is a species of pepper, and liquorice\r\nreputedly has strong support as an energizing agent.\r\n\r\nAnother milk concoction contains seeds of long pepper, seeds of\r\nsanseviera roxburghiana, and the hedysarum gangeticum plant, pounded\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nStill another recipe advocates milk and sugar, in which the testes of a\r\nram or goat have been boiled.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn Indian excitant, reputedly effective, is a kind of liquid paste\r\nconsisting of roots of the trapa bispinosa plant, tuscan jasmine, the\r\nkasurika plant, liquorice, and kshirakapoli. All these ingredients, most\r\nof them indigenous to India, are crushed together and the conglomerate\r\npowder is put into a mixture of milk, sugar, and clarified butter, that\r\nis, ghee. The entire concoction is then slowly boiled. This is\r\nconsidered a potent amatory beverage, and is so recommended in the\r\nmanuals.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGhee is commonly used in Indian culinary practice. It is also a frequent\r\ningredient in potions and compounds that are directed toward genital\r\nexcitations. A reputedly forceful agent of this sort is the following\r\nrecipe, in which ghee appears. Sesame seeds are soaked with sparrows’\r\neggs: then boiled in milk, to which ghee and sugar, the fruit of the\r\ntrapa bispinosa plant and the kasurika plant, as well as beans and wheat\r\nflour, have been added.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSparrows’ eggs and rice, boiled in milk with an admixture of honey and\r\nghee, provide what is considered an effective amatory stimulant.\r\n\r\nA concoction of milk, honey, ghee, liquorice, sugar, and the juice of\r\nthe fennel plant is considered a provocative beverage.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBoiled ghee itself, taken as a morning drink in spring time, is\r\nbelieved, in Hindu erotology, to form a positive excitant for amorous\r\npractices.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCertain oriental plants that have special erotic virtues are mentioned\r\nfrequently in Hindu amatory treatises. Among such plants are: the\r\nshvadaustra plant, asparagus racemosus, the guduchi plant, liquorice,\r\nlong pepper, and the premna spinosa. These are often used in compounds\r\nto form a potion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the diversified prescriptions, compounds, and philtres contained\r\nin the Ananga-Ranga or in similar erotic manuals mentioned in this\r\nsurvey, not a few are merely innocuous in action by virtue of their\r\ninnocuous ingredients. Others are merely ineffective, while still others\r\nmay be decidedly fraught with hazards and dangers in their reactions.\r\nAll potions and amatory concoctions, therefore, either alluded to or\r\ndescribed in greater detail in this present conspectus, are treated from\r\nan academic or historical or solely informative viewpoint, not as ad hoc\r\nspecifics for any physiologically amatory condition whatever.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Ananga-Ranga usually includes, among amatory items that form\r\nenergizing concoctions, plants, roots, blossoms, flowers that are\r\nindigenous to India. Many of these plants have their modern botanical\r\ndesignations in Latin terminology, while others still remain\r\nunidentifiable or extremely rare.\r\n\r\nKuili powder, lechi, kanta-gokhru, kakri, and laghushatavari, compounded\r\nas a mixture in milk, will, it is asserted, create manifest\r\nphysiological vigor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn amatory drink concocted in the East is thus compounded: Pith of the\r\nmoh tree, well pounded and mixed with cow’s milk. It constitutes a\r\nhighly strengthening potion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong wealthy Chinese, lavish dining includes a special broth or soup.\r\nThis soup is particularly favored for its energizing and provocative\r\nexcitation. The soup is prepared from the nests of sea-swallows, highly\r\nspiced. These nests are built from edible sea-weeds, to which cling\r\nfish—spawn particles rich in phosphorus. As an erotic beverage, the soup\r\nis reputed to be extremely efficacious.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong Chinese in low economic levels, nuoc-man is used as a love\r\nstimulant. It is an extraction of decomposed fish, prepared like\r\ncod-liver oil.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe leaves of cubeb pepper, in an infusion, are considered in Chinese\r\nerotology to produce marked amatory tendencies.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA very popular pill, whose composition, however, is not revealed to the\r\nreader, appears again and again in the long picaresque, erotic Chinese\r\nnovel entitled _Chin P’ing Mei_. One of the characters, a monk,\r\nrecommends to the adventurous hero that a certain pill, to be taken in a\r\ndrop of spirits, has remarkable potency, which is specified numerically\r\nand in the degree of its voluptuousness. The erotic effects, in fact,\r\nare described by the monk in verse. The pill, yellow in hue, and ovoid\r\nin shape, is of the utmost efficacy, over a long expanse of days, the\r\nmasculine vigor, described generously and enticingly, increasing with\r\neach successive day and each amatory encounter.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom a genital gland of the musk-deer and also of a species of goat that\r\nthrives in Tartary, a bitter, volatile substance is extracted, that is\r\ntermed musk. In the Orient, notably in Tibet and in Iran, musk has been\r\nin use, in culinary preparations, for its assumed erotic virtues.\r\n\r\nMusk, in fact, is pervasively associated with amatory sensations. To the\r\nideal woman, according to Hindu erotology, whose pulchritude and appeal\r\nare beyond criticism, clings the aroma of musk, elusive, tantalizing.\r\n\r\nMusk has long been involved in erotic practices, and its virtue in this\r\ndirection has been repeatedly emphasized in amatory manuals,\r\nparticularly among the Arabs. Even in tales and legends, in poetry and\r\nin chronicles, the perfume of musk and its marked allure play no small\r\npart in the creation of romantic episodes.\r\n\r\nThe tradition of musk as an amatory agent, arousing mental and sensual\r\nerotic images and inclinations, lingers on into contemporary times. In a\r\npopular mystery tale, _The Return of Dr. Fu-Manchu_, by Sax Rohmer, the\r\nplot centres around a sinister, super-intelligent Oriental operator\r\nnamed Dr. Fu-Manchu. One of his hirelings is the woman called Kâramanèh.\r\nHer nearness is sensed by the narrator, a certain Dr. Petrie. He detects\r\nthe perfume, which ‘like a breath of musk, spoke of the Orient.’ It\r\nseemed to intoxicate the narrator, disturbing his rational faculties,\r\nsuggesting the beauty of the villainous Kâramanèh.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the inexhaustible richness of world literature, in every country and\r\nin every century, there are texts, memoirs, guides, novels, dramas,\r\npoetry, sagas and legends that are devoted largely, occasionally\r\nexclusively, to the amatory theme: from the Dialogues of Luisa Sigea to\r\nPietro Aretino’s lascivious sonnets, from the amatory epistles of\r\nAlciphron to the lush and fantastic orgiastic extravagances of the\r\nMarquis de Sade.\r\n\r\nAmong all this heterogeneous variety of treatment, viewpoint, and\r\nexposition, there is the almost universally accepted standard text,\r\noriginally produced in Sanskrit by Vatsyayana, of the Kama Sutra, the\r\nApothegms on Love, the essence of amatory science, the distillations of\r\nerotic precepts.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA certain plant named Pellitory of Spain, and, in Latin terminology,\r\nAnacyclus Pyrethrum, has a traditionally credited amatory quality. The\r\nplant is so considered in Arab erotological literature.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Orient, knowledgeable in the virtues and characteristics of\r\nnumberless extracts and distillations, unguents and lotions, considered\r\nambergris, as a perfume, to be endowed with restorative, life-preserving\r\nproperties. Anciently, among the Persians, there was a tonic composed of\r\nprecious stones—pearls, and rubies, and gold, and powdered ambergris,\r\nproducing a pastille that was eaten with anticipatory amatory prospects.\r\n\r\nIn modern times, too, in the East, coffee is often drunk in which a\r\ntouch of ambergris has been intruded.\r\n\r\nVery anciently, ambergris had reputedly amazing qualities, that would\r\nproduce, temporarily, a state of rejuvenescence in aged suppliants.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlmonds belong to the Orient. Their fragrance is entwined in Oriental\r\npoetry, in Oriental legend, and in Oriental modes of living. It is\r\ntherefore not surprising that the almond, variously prepared, whether\r\npowdered, or reduced to an oil, is associated with invigorating tonics.\r\n_The Perfumed Garden_, the erotic handbook written by the Arab\r\nerotologist the Sheikh Nefzawi, describes a number of preparations in\r\nwhich the base is almond.\r\n\r\nHe recommends the eating of some twenty almonds, with a glassful of\r\nhoney, and one hundred pine-tree grains, just before retiring to bed. As\r\nan alternate, there is chicken broth, with cream, yolk of eggs, and\r\npowdered almonds.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Eastern Asia there has always been, for untold ages, an awareness of\r\nthe stimulating effects of certain foods. So, among the Annamites, the\r\nchief food was fish, which, according to certain anthropological studies\r\nand investigations, gives an appreciably lascivious tendency to this\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAmong other foods, they are addicted to garlic, which they consume in\r\nlarge quantities, ginger, and onion, all of which have aphrodisiac\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are other erotogenic means, contrivances and manipulative devices,\r\nmentioned in Hindu manuals, that are designed for ithyphallic\r\ninducements.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Orient has always been a rich source for erotic material. Formal\r\nmanuals, anthologies, poetry all stress amatory concepts, erotic\r\nsituations, amorous encounters. In 1907 the Mercure de France published\r\nan Anthologie de L’Amour Asiatique, by a certain Thalasso. It ranges\r\nover many countries of the Asiatic continent, describing the traits and\r\ntemperaments of the women of these countries from an amatory viewpoint.\r\nThe author quotes a Georgian popular song, that contains the essence of\r\nthe anthology. It is that the purpose of every man, every husband,\r\nshould be to devise varying amatory pleasures. He should know how to\r\nrenew the enjoyments of Aphrodite. He should be skilled in avoiding\r\nmonotony and satiety. Every woman of every country has her own\r\npeculiarities, her own coyness, her own aggressiveness. The women of\r\nEgypt, he says, are promiscuous, though beautiful. All the coquettish\r\narts are known to Persian women. The Abyssinians are slim and\r\nwell-formed and appealing in looks. The women of the Hedjaz are apart;\r\nthey maintain their honor and their modesty, and there are no harlots\r\namong them. In Constantinople all the women, in pulchritude, resemble\r\nVenus, but they are of varying degrees of chastity. Circassian women are\r\nlike the moon. Georgian women are very tender-hearted, and persistent\r\npleas will win the day with them.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Orient is always prepared to experiment with strange objects, unique\r\ndevices, complicated contraptions, protracted and difficult treatments,\r\nall for the ultimate purpose of recovering the libido, or protracting\r\nthe amatory span, or maintaining full and effectual vigor.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, a man’s molar tooth: and the bone of a lapwing’s\r\nleft wing. Place in a purse, under the woman’s pillow. Tell her of your\r\naction. The result, presumably by means of the implied sympathetic\r\nmagic, will be very favorable.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA plant belonging in the satyrion species, called Orchis Morio, that is\r\nnative to the South East of Europe, particularly in the area near\r\nIstanbul, is used in Turkey as an excitant.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe juice of the roots of the mandayantaka plant, the clitoria\r\nternateea, the anjanika plant, the shlakshnaparni plant and the yellow\r\namaranth, compounded into a lotion, constituted an Oriental invigorating\r\nrecipe.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the Japanese, a root highly esteemed for its amatory potential is\r\nninjin, which has properties analogous to those of the mandrake.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are fond of a sauce called nuoc-man. Spiced with garlic and\r\npimento, this fish extract, similar to the Roman garum, is treated as a\r\nstimulant, containing, as it does, genesiac elements: salt and\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs the West inherited and absorbed many cultural phases, views,\r\nconcepts, practices, mores from the East, it likewise acquired some of\r\nthe amatory and medicinal knowledge relating to electuaries and healing\r\nmethods, herbs and plants that might be contributory to health and\r\nwell-being, and, as an antique encyclopedic work suggests, an exciter to\r\nvenery. Thus Zacutus Lusitanus, Zacutus the Portuguese, a medieval\r\nphysician, author of a medical text entitled _Praxis Medica Admiranda_,\r\nenumerates the ingredients of an amatory preparation. The composition is\r\nas follows: Musk and ambergris, pterocarpus santalinus, both red and\r\nyellow, calamus aromaticus, cinnamon, bole Tuccinum, galanga,\r\naloes-wood, rhubarb, absinthe, Indian myrobalon: all pounded together.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable literary erotic production of China may reasonably\r\nbe considered to be the picaresque novel Chin P’ing Mei, the adventurous\r\nhistory of Hsi Men and his six wives. It has been styled the Chinese\r\nDecameron, but it transcends the scope, the contents, the variousness of\r\nincident and characterization and sense of vivid reality manifested in\r\nBoccaccio’s Decameron. The Chinese tale is full of a variety of scenes\r\nand episodes, in the manner of the European large-scaled, spacious\r\nnovel. It is also permeated by a tone of ribaldry, a vein of salacious\r\neroticism, and a large number of episodes describing amatory\r\nexperiences. One particular scene deals with a species of pill, the\r\ncomposition of which is not revealed, that has unique functional\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn China erotic perversions were as numerous as in ancient Rome. The\r\ncinaedus, the Gito who is prominent in Petronius’ _Satyricon_, is termed\r\nin China _amasi_. Dr. Jacobus X, the French anthropologist, has a great\r\ndeal to say on this subject.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Islamic concept of erotic practice is associated with devoutness. It\r\nimplies the transmission to man of the divine creative force. Thus the\r\nerotic never becomes lewd or lascivious or prurient for the mere purpose\r\nof lubricity. The Koran counsels physiological intimacy as a sacred\r\nfunction, an ordained and enjoined rite. Omar Haleby ibn Othman, the\r\nArab erotologist, likewise chants the erotic act as an expression, a\r\nmanifestation derived from sacred sources. The erotic consummation has\r\nlost its fleshly, earthy connotation. It has assumed a venerable and\r\nvenerated sanctity.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the ancient Orient and even in much later ages, the phallus was an\r\nobject of veneration not in a prurient or lustful sense, but as the\r\nsource of procreation, the emblem of maternity. For sterility was the\r\nmajor, the primary curse. Hence any means might be exercised to\r\ncounteract this catastrophic condition, this mark of divine disfavor,\r\nthis racial blight. Hence too among certain ethnic communities as well\r\nas in Biblical literature the stranger, or the occasional traveler, or\r\nthe concubine, was offered conjugal status, for the sole purpose of\r\neffecting generation.\r\n\r\nHorror of sterility drove women to ceaseless supplications, to priapic\r\ninvocations, to priapic contacts, to secret devices, and to magic aid.\r\nIn the East, there was the belief that to walk over certain stones was a\r\nremedy for such sterility. In Madagascar a stone was held in reverence\r\nas promoting both agricultural and human fertility. In obscure regions\r\nof the Pyrenees Mountains, as well as in France, similar stones were\r\nbelieved conducive to amatory excitation and also to fertility. And\r\nthese stones were merely worn and weather-beaten vestiges of the\r\noriginal phallic shapes or other analogous forms.\r\n\r\nIn India, too, the lingam and the yoni were pervasively revered\r\nthroughout the continent. There were temples lined with hundreds of\r\nlingams, garlanded with flowers, anointed with ghee in continuous\r\nadoration.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA mixture of rose water, powdered almonds, and sugar is an old Arab\r\ndrink that was commonly considered to correct incapacity. So too with a\r\nmixture, cooked together, of cloves, ginger, nuts, wild lavender, and\r\nnutmeg.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Koran contains prescriptions that govern the daily life, material\r\nand spiritual, of Moslems. For amatory purposes, which in themselves\r\nimply a sacred function, certain perfumes are recommended as stimulants.\r\nMusk is most frequently mentioned and used. Also camphor, essence of\r\nrose, olibanum, and cascarilla.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe erotic theme in general is always associated, in Arab texts, with\r\nreverence and sanctity, never with prurience. The Arab erotologist Omar\r\nHaleby asserts that the Prophet himself advised recourse to invocations\r\nin the case of physiological incapacity.\r\n\r\nThe erotic consummation, repeats Omar Haleby, must be considered as an\r\nact inspired by the divinity. It is the why and the wherefore of the\r\nentire cosmos, the divine law of the conservation of the human species.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo promote physiological vigor, Moslem tradition recommends frequent\r\ncold ablutions. Nourishment also holds an important position, and\r\nspecific suggestions of food are made. Fish caught in the sea are\r\nhelpful. Also: lentils and truffles, mutton boiled in fennel, cumin, and\r\nanise: eggs, especially the yolk, and saffron. Dried dates have a value\r\nin this respect, as well as honey and pigeon’s blood. Effective\r\nelectuaries may be compounded with these ingredients.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn old Oriental manual, putatively basing many of its assertions on the\r\nsecrets of the Kabbala, classifies various types of love: Lust and\r\npassion and the rarer, ultimate, absolute spiritual love. Amatory\r\nemotions are enumerated and guidance is offered in several directions.\r\nWomen are placed in various categories, according to their physical\r\ntraits, their personal attractions, their sensibilities.\r\n\r\nAs a general counsel of perfection, particularly for celibates,\r\ncorporeal hygiene is enjoined at all times. The routine of Nature\r\nitself, it is suggested, is an exemplary mentor, involving alternations\r\nof rest and work in due moderation. In the matter of consumption of\r\nfood, too, restraint is advised. Food should be taken in silence,\r\nslowly, and while facing the East. Adherence to such prescriptions, it\r\nis stressed, will produce a corporeal and spiritual balance free from\r\nviolent entanglements.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the woman, there are thirty-two points that, in their\r\ntotality, produce perfection and beauty for the allurement of men. These\r\npoints include whiteness of skin, dark hair, pink tongue, small ears,\r\nand moderate height.\r\n\r\nOther Oriental handbooks elaborate, on the other hand, on all the\r\npossible permutations conducive to amatory consummations. These almost\r\nexclusively follow Hindu, Arab, and Turkish tradition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n                                 INDIA\r\n\r\n\r\nIndia is a spacious land of astounding contrasts and variations. It is a\r\nland of mystery and mysticism, and at the same time it investigates\r\nreality with infinite patience. It is a land of diversified, age-old\r\ncultures, and its ancient university at Taxila in the Punjab ante-dated\r\nthe Hellenic Academy and Aristotle’s Lyceum by long centuries. Yet it\r\nhas had and still has illiterate villages, where legends and sagas of\r\nantique doings are still transmitted orally. It is a continent of\r\nabundant wealth, and its maharajas and princelings and emperors have\r\nbeen resplendent in golden raiment, exultant in their treasure houses\r\nwhere lakhs of rupees lie heaped alongside rubies and emeralds, diamonds\r\nand pearls, and a dozen other varieties of precious stones, almost\r\nbeyond human reckoning and evaluation. Yet, within this very century,\r\nchildren have stood at lonely wayside stations, from Bombay to\r\nRawalpindi, in the Punjab and in Bengal, in the North West Frontier and\r\nin Madras Presidency, clamoring for roti and pani, bread and water. It\r\nis a land of lavish fertility, and a land of recurrent famine and\r\ndevastation. A land of hieratic formalities and a land of innovation.\r\n\r\nIndia is a country of artistic achievements of the highest order, of\r\nprofound philosophical speculation, of monumental poetic and literary\r\nproduction. It is dedicated to things of the spirit, yet its Kali craves\r\nblood. It clings adhesively to remote traditions, to ethnic and\r\nreligious mores, to indurated social ways. Yet it forges ahead, eager to\r\nmaintain itself in the forefront of industrial expansion. It maintains\r\nold domestic and communal demarcations and rigidities, yet it welcomes\r\nthe novelties, the mutations of this restless age. It is dedicated to\r\nintellectual, cosmological meditation, yet it probes into sexual\r\nmanners, into the characteristics of lust and passion, and all the\r\nsecretive unspoken intimacies of carnality. It has practically made a\r\nmonopoly of texts and treatises on the subject of love and all its\r\ndarker and more intricate and subtle manifestations. It is a country\r\nthat has produced, in this field, six of the major manuals, poetic\r\neulogies or expositions, dealing with the forms and practices of\r\nAphrodite Pandemos.\r\n\r\nThe Ratirahasya, variously called the Koka Shastra, was the work of the\r\npoet Kukkoka. It consists of some eight hundred verses on love\r\ntechniques.\r\n\r\nThe Ananga-Ranga, also called Kamaledhiplava, was written by the poet\r\nKullianmull, and belongs in the fifteenth or sixteenth century A.D. The\r\ncontents describe factually and realistically the physical\r\ncharacteristics of various types of women, their deportment, dress,\r\nfacial and bodily traits, their amatory responsiveness, together with\r\ncertain principles that establish objective amatory criteria.\r\n\r\nThe Rasmanjari was the work of the poet Bhanudatta. It classifies men\r\nand women according to personal behavior, age, physical type.\r\n\r\nThe Smara Pradipa, consisting of some four hundred verses, expounds\r\namatory laws or tendencies. It was the work of the poet Gunakara.\r\n\r\nThe Ratimanjari is a brief poetic exposition on love, whose author was\r\nthe poet Jayadeva.\r\n\r\nThe Panchasakya is considerably longer, and is divided into five Arrows.\r\nThe author was Jyotirisha.\r\n\r\nWoman, in these treatises and poetic elaborations and expositions, is\r\nthe central theme, and her physical traits, ideally considered, and the\r\nelements that, cumulatively, constitute her dominant attraction, are\r\nminutely and imaginatively depicted: the texture of the skin, the shape\r\nof the moon face, the coloring of the hair, the brightness of eye are\r\nmeasured and defined in relation to cosmic phenomena, to flowers, to the\r\nlotus, to the mustard blossom, to the lily and the fawn, and, above all,\r\nher devoutness is stressed, and her impassioned worship of the Hindu\r\npantheon, the totality of the deities.\r\n\r\nThe Kama Sutra is an extended exposition of love and its procedures and\r\nmanipulations, in some 1200 verses divided into sections in which\r\nvarious aspects and techniques in amatory mores are treated.\r\n\r\nAnd, like The Perfumed Garden and similar Oriental excursions into\r\nsexual activities, it diffuses an aura of religiosity, a solemn sense of\r\nreverence, a divine acknowledgment. The tone is frank without prurience:\r\nthe elaborate classifications and injunctions are minute and lucid\r\nwithout introducing an undercurrent, however unobtrusive, of deliberate\r\nand gross scurrilities. It is not libidinous, then, in intent, for the\r\nauthor himself, a profoundly contemplative religious devotee, adumbrated\r\nhis work, not as a salacious and lewd inducement to debauchery, but as\r\nan exposition of the physiological man who, while making concessions in\r\nconformity with certain established amatory principles, may yet\r\ntranscend his carnal desires and, instead of being enslaved by his\r\nerotic lusts, may become master of them and use them under due control,\r\nbut never without restraint and a kind of Hellenic and Aristotelian\r\nmoderation, a physiological aurea mediocritas.\r\n\r\nThe floruit of the author of the Kama Sutra has not been determined\r\ndefinitively. It has been variously assigned between the first and the\r\nsixth century A.D.\r\n\r\nThe entire work is pervaded by the three Hindu concepts of Dharma,\r\ngoodness or virtue, in the Greek sense, Artha, which is wealth, and\r\nKama, sensual pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe range of topics covers normal and abnormal conditions and practices:\r\nwedded love and fellatio, public harlotry and transvestism, courtship\r\nand the frenzies of passion, the behavior of wives during a husband’s\r\nabsence, the artifices of feminine conquest, osculation and amatory\r\npermutations, the employment of an intermediary, the ways of the\r\ncourtesan, and, finally, personal adornment, tonic medicines, methods of\r\nexciting desire.\r\n\r\nIn respect of the latter, there are various recipes involving oils,\r\nunguents, and juices. One unguent that has amatory appeal is composed of\r\ntabernamontana coronaria, costus speciosus, and flacourtia cataphracta.\r\n\r\nAnother aid is oil of hogweed, echites putrescens, the sarina plant,\r\nyellow amaranth, and leaf of nymphae. This salve is applied to the body.\r\n\r\nLet the man eat the powder of the nelumbrium speciosum, the blue lotus,\r\nthe mesna roxburghii, together with clarified butter, which is ghee, and\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\nThe bone of a peacock, or of a hyena, covered with gold and fastened on\r\nthe right hand, has an exciting effect.\r\n\r\nSimilarly with a bead made from the seed of the jujube or a conch shell,\r\nthat is enchanted by magic spells and then fastened on the hand.\r\n\r\nA mixture of powders of white thorn apple, black pepper, long pepper,\r\nand honey is reputedly a means of female subjugation.\r\n\r\nSo with an ointment made of the emblica myrabolens plant.\r\n\r\nA drink of milk and sugar, the pipar chaba, liquorice, and the root of\r\nthe uchchata plant is an invigorating agent.\r\n\r\nA liquid consisting of milk mixed with juice of the kuili plant, the\r\nhedysarum gangeticum, and the kshirika plant is likewise a stimulant.\r\n\r\nA drink of a paste consisting of asparagus racemosus, the guduchi plant,\r\nthe shvadaushtra plant, long pepper, liquorice: boiled in milk, ghee,\r\nand honey, and taken in the spring time.\r\n\r\nA man who plays on a reed pipe smeared with juices of the bahupadika\r\nplant the costus arabicus, the euphorbia antiquorum, the tabernamontana\r\ncoronaria, the pinus deodora, the kantaka plant, and the vajfa plant\r\nwill effect female subjugation.\r\n\r\nA camel bone, dipped into the juice of the eclipta prostata, then\r\nburned, and pigment from the ashes placed in a box made of camel bone,\r\nand applied to the eyelashes with a camel bone pencil are also a means\r\nof subjugation.\r\n\r\nA drink of boiled clarified butter, in the morning, in the spring time,\r\nis equally effective.\r\n\r\nA drink of asparagus racemosus and the shvadaushtra plant, with pounded\r\nfruit of premna spinosa, in water.\r\n\r\nA drink composed as follows: The covering of sesame seeds, soaked in\r\nsparrows’ eggs: boiled in milk, with ghee and sugar, with fruit of the\r\ntrapa bispinosa and the kasuriki plant: with the addition of flour of\r\nbeans and wheat.\r\n\r\nVigor is increased by a brew consisting of rice, with sparrows’ eggs:\r\nboiled in milk, together with honey and ghee.\r\n\r\nThe Kama Sutra suggests that the means of arousing vigor may also be\r\nlearned from medicine, from the Vedas, and from adepts in Magic. Nothing\r\nthat may be injurious in its effects, however, should be employed, only\r\nsuch means as are holy and recognized as good.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOther stimulants that are known to the Hindu manuals of erotology\r\ninclude the following:\r\n\r\nThe anvalli nut is stripped of its outer shell. The juice is then\r\nextracted. It is dried in the sun and subsequently mixed with powdered\r\nanvalli nut. The paste is eaten with ghee, honey, and candied sugar.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA compound of hog plum, eugenia jambreana, and flowers of the nauclia\r\ncadamba. These items are all indigenous to India, as are so many of the\r\ningredients mentioned in the Indian treatises. In many cases, however,\r\nthe plants and fruits, herbs and extracts are not unknown and are\r\navailable in the Occident.\r\n\r\nTo gain amatory acquiescence and supremacy over the person desired, the\r\nfollowing Hindu preparation is recommended: A few pieces of arris root\r\nare mixed with mango oil. They are then placed in an aperture in the\r\ntrunk of the sisu tree. The pieces are left thus for some six months, at\r\nwhich time an ointment is compounded, reputedly effective in a genital\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lotus, jasmine, and the asoka plant are in the opinion of Hindu\r\nerotologists provocative of venery. With respect to the lotus, this\r\nplant is associated with the ideal feminine personality, supreme\r\npulchritude and perfection symbolized by the Lotus Woman.\r\n\r\nHemp contains elements productive of sexual stimuli. In Hindu erotology,\r\nthe leaves and seeds of the plant are chewed in this expectation. On\r\noccasion, the seeds are mixed with other ingredients: ambergris, sugar,\r\nand musk: all of which are credibly of aphrodisiac quality.\r\n\r\nAn infusion of hemp leaves and seed capsules is drunk as a liquor.\r\n\r\nAn extract of hemp, much used in India, is charas, which is both smoked\r\nand eaten. Botanically, hemp is the plant Cannabis Indica, from which\r\nare produced over 150 drug preparations.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn Indian plant named bhuya—kokali and, in botanical terminology,\r\nsolanum Jacquini, is credited with erotic properties. The juice is\r\nextracted and dried in the sun. This is then mixed with ghee, candied\r\nsugar, and honey, and taken as a potion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCalamint, an aromatic herb, was used in India as an amatory excitant.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChutney, a characteristically Indian relish, is compounded of fruits,\r\nherbs, and seasonings. Apart from its culinary use, chutney is\r\nconsidered a sensual stimulant.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nErotic ingenuities have devised variations in physiological relations.\r\nThe Arab erotologist the Sheikh Nefzawi, in his _The Perfumed Garden_,\r\nalludes to this ingenuity in the case of Indian practices, where\r\ntwenty-nine possible forms of intimacy were in vogue.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn eye-salve called collyrium was known among the Romans as, apart from\r\nits ophthalmological virtue, a sexual aid. Collyrium was so considered\r\nin India too, where it was also credited with possessing magic qualities\r\nthat were applicable to erotic manifestations.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMacabre concoctions have been the stock in trade of the dispensers of\r\nphiltres and excitants in all ages among all races. A prescription that\r\nis urged in Hindu erotological literature runs as follows: A compound\r\nconsisting of flowers thrown on a corpse that is being carried to a\r\nburning ghat for disposal: along with a mixture compounded of the\r\npowdered bones of the peacock and of the jiwanjiva bird, and the leaf of\r\nthe plant vatodbhranta. A genital application promises, in the opinion\r\nof the Hindu manuals, marked physiological vigor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany Oriental treatises on erotology deal with the physiological\r\ncharacteristics of men and women, temperamental differences, erotic\r\npostures in multiple varieties, and recommendations regarding local\r\ninguinal applications. The topic of potions as such is far less\r\nextensively treated, largely for the reason that the love-potion,\r\ninnocuous and effectual, is actually rare. Yet each manual is hopeful\r\nand anticipatory in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe Ananga-Ranga, of which a French translation appeared in Paris in\r\n1920, in the Bibliothèque des Curieux, was originally composed in\r\nSanskrit in the sixteenth century by the poet Kalyanamalla. It covers\r\ncosmetic hints and amatory devices, hygienic suggestions, periapts and\r\nincantations designed to attract and retain affection. It discusses the\r\nfour major types of women, their personal characteristics, the hours and\r\ndays most propitious for intimacy. There are tables and statistics that\r\ngo into minute detail on these points. There is a table classifying and\r\ndifferentiating the seats of passion, the erotogenic areas. There are\r\nseveral pages of tables that expound different types of embrace with\r\ndifferent types of partners. Nothing is left to chance. Nothing is\r\nomitted. The text marches forward, with confidence and a sense of\r\nauthority, from the uprising of the libido to the ultimate consummation.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of men, their physiological frame, their capacities\r\nare evaluated, with a remarkable substantiation of tables and statistics\r\nand measurements. The temperaments of women are reviewed with equal\r\nthoroughness, and the regions of India are considered geographically and\r\nerotically in relation to this topic.\r\n\r\nAphrodisiacs, both external and internal, are treated: drugs and charms,\r\nmagic unguents, fascinating incense, incantations and invocations.\r\n\r\nAn external application runs thus: Shopa or anise seed, that is, anethum\r\nsowa, reduced to a powder. An electuary is made with honey. This\r\napplication, according to the Ananga-Ranga, promises effective results.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOr, Take Asclepias gigantea. Crush and beat in a mortar with leaves of\r\njai, until the juice has been extracted. This too is an external\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain: The fruit of the Tamarinda Indica; crush in a mortar, with honey\r\nand Sindura.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe seeds of Urid, in milk and sugar. Expose for three consecutive days\r\nto the sun. Then crush to a powder. Knead into cake form. Fry in ghee.\r\nEat this concoction every morning.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne hundred and fifty seeds of the inner bark of the Moh tree. Heap in a\r\nmortar and beat. Drink it in cow’s milk.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn a Tuesday, extract the entrails of a blue jay—coracias indica—and put\r\ninto the body a little kama-salila. Place the bird in an earthen pot and\r\ncover it with a second pot moistened with mud: keep it in an uncluttered\r\nspot for seven days. At the end of that time take out the contents and\r\nreduce them to a powder. Make pills, and dry them. One pill to be taken\r\nby a man or a woman: that will be sufficient to promote vigor and\r\nlibido.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMagic verses will be equally effective: also the chanting of a mantra,\r\nfor the efficacy resides in the Devata, the deity therein. Or pronounce\r\nformulas and utter invocations, such as:\r\n\r\n    Oh Kameshwar, submit this person to my will!\r\n\r\nUtter the hallowed and mystic term Om! Mention the name of the woman who\r\nis the object of the passion. Then conclude with Anaya! Anaya!\r\n\r\nPulverize kasturi, which is common musk, and wood of yellow tetu. Mix\r\nwith old honey, two months old, and apply genitally.\r\n\r\nSandalwood and red powder of curcuma and alum and costus and black\r\nsandalwood, together with white Vala and the bark of the Deodaru.\r\nPowder, and mix with honey: then allow to dry. This is now Chinta—mani\r\nDupha: an incense that will promote your efficiency, dominate all\r\nthought, and, according to the promise of the manual, make you master of\r\nthe entire universe.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo prepare a powerful and alluring incense, mix equal quantities of\r\ncardamom seeds, oliba, and the plant Garurwel, sandalwood, the flower of\r\njasmine, and Bengal madder.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPulverize bombax heptaphyllum: macerate in milk. Then apply the paste to\r\nthe face. This will produce amatory reactions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTake bibva nuts and black salt, leaves of lotus. Reduce to ashes and\r\nsoak in solanum Jacquini. Apply with buffalo excrement and the result\r\nwill be most favorable.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMix equal parts of the juice of rosa glanduifera, expressed from the\r\nleaves, and ghee or clarified butter. Boil with ten parts of milk,\r\nsugar, and honey. Drink this concoction regularly. The result will be a\r\nstate of active vigor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTake saptaparna on a Sunday by mouth, with a prospect of renewed vigor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSoak the seeds of Urid in milk and sugar: dry in the sun for three days.\r\nReduce the whole to a powder. Knead into cake consistency. Fry in ghee.\r\nEat this every morning. However old the patient may be, he will acquire\r\ngreat vigor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe seeds of white Tal-makhana, macerated in the juice of the banyan\r\ntree. Mix with seeds of karanj and put into the mouth.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVajikarana. This agent restores strength and physical vigor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Ananga-Ranga, like other Oriental erotic manuals, concludes\r\ndevoutly: May this treatise, Ananga-Ranga, be dear to men and women, so\r\nlong as the sacred River Ganges flows from Siva’s breast with his wife\r\nGauri by his left side: so long as Lakhmi shall love Vishnu: so long as\r\nBrahma shall be engaged in the study of the Vedas, and so long as the\r\nearth shall endure, and the moon, and the sun.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCurry is especially associated with Indian culinary preparations. It is\r\na sauce compounded of a variety of spices in varying proportions:\r\ncoriander seeds, cumin, ginger, cardamom seeds, turmeric, garlic,\r\nvinegar, and mustard seeds. In addition to its use as a condiment, curry\r\nhas been held to possess a stimulative quality.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a rule when physiological vigor is defective or ineffectual in some\r\nrespect, stimulants are advised to remedy the condition. In a contrary\r\nsense, however, when the libido is too intense and too active, a Hindu\r\nrecommendation, designed to modify the urgency, consists of a special\r\napplication. This application is compounded of the juice of the fruits\r\nof the cassia fistula, eugenia jambolana, in a mixture of powder of\r\nvernonia anthelmentica, the soma plant, the lohopa—jihirka, and the\r\neclipta prostata: all of these plants being native to India.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe plant botanically designated Emblica Myrabolens, states the Hindu\r\nmanual Kama Sutra, is conducive to the vita sexualis, when the plant is\r\ncompounded into an ointment.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe same manual, adding a goetic touch to a prescription, asserts the\r\nstimulative value of a bead formed from jujube seed or conch shell, over\r\nwhich an incantation had been uttered. The bead is attached to the hand.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor a diminution of physiological vigor, or for its total elimination in\r\nan amatory direction, Indian manuals suggested a long, rigid treatment.\r\nIt consisted of the daily consumption of young leaves of mairkousi.\r\nFakirs and other holy men were subjected to this regimen until full\r\nmanhood was reached at the age of twenty-five.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFennel, an aromatic plant, has long been in use in culinary\r\npreparations. It has also a reputation for inspiring energy in an\r\naphrodisiac sense. In India, it is used for this purpose in the\r\nfollowing form: The juice of the fennel plant is mixed with honey, milk,\r\nsugar, liquorice, and ghee or clarified butter.\r\n\r\nThis concoction is viewed with a certain religious respect and is\r\nassociated with a drink fit for the gods.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerfumes have at all times been included in the amatory pharmacopoeia.\r\nAmong Indian erotologists, perfumed fumigation is considered a powerful\r\nexcitant.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn India, ghee, which is clarified butter, is normally used in cookery.\r\nAt the same time it is credited with amatory properties. A drink of\r\nboiled ghee, taken in the morning, in the spring time, is among the\r\nerotic recipes of the Hindu treatises.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a frequent base for love recipes, ginger, which is also commonly used\r\nin the Orient for dietary purposes, is generally present as an amatory\r\nitem, and is taken by mouth with pepper, honey, and other spices.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery natural phenomenon, every product of the fields, whatever dwells\r\non sea or is hidden underground: all such items have at some time or\r\nother been tested and recommended for their potential contribution to\r\namatory functions. So even the breeze in spring time has had its\r\neulogists in Hindu erotology as an amorous inspiration: also the flowers\r\nthat are in bud, the songs and twitterings of birds, and the humming\r\nsibilance of bees. Similarly, music was recommended as promotive of\r\ndesire. Even, on occasion, the touch of a person, an aroma, a taste, a\r\nsound, a form may stir longings. In a more earthy and domestic sense,\r\nleeks and garlic, beans and onions have been found useful as stimulants.\r\nSome concoctions are merely hinted at, without being given a\r\nnomenclature. Thus an ancient Greek historian is cited by the Greek\r\nencyclopedist Athenaeus himself, in his _Banquet of the Philosophers_,\r\nas authority for a certain Hindu preparation.\r\n\r\nWhen applied to the soles of the feet, it created an immediate and\r\npowerful amatory reaction. But this specific, as so many others, has\r\nfaded into oblivion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Kama Sutra recommends an ointment compounded thus: Xanthochymus\r\npichorius, honey, ghee, tabernamontana coronaria, mesna roxburghii,\r\nnelumbrium speciosum, and blue lotus.\r\n\r\nAnother compound, to be taken by mouth, is blue lotus and powder of the\r\nnelumbrium speciosum, mixed with honey and ghee.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmatory provocation may be induced by certain powders and ointments made\r\nfrom the following plants: Costus speciosus, tabernamontana coronaria,\r\nand flacourtia cataphracta, compounded together.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor genital potency, preparations, mechanical devices, electuaries,\r\nunguents, incantations, and brews have been urged in Hindu manuals. In\r\naddition to the variety of ointments herbs, spices, and animal\r\nsecretions, surgical operations, hazardous both physiologically and\r\nemotionally, have been gravely prescribed.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn unusual procedure for strengthening vigor involves a mixture that is\r\nto be thrown at the person desired. The mixture is composed of powder of\r\nmilk, kantaka plant, and the hedge plant, with the powdered root of the\r\nlanjalika plant and the excrement of a monkey.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA mixture of cowach and honey, along with the pulverized remains of a\r\ndead kite and the prickly hairs of a tropical plant. This is a means of\r\namatory supremacy.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn application of Lechi, costus arabicus, kanher root, chikana,\r\ngajapimpali, and askhand, pulverized and mixed with ghee.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo strengthen and recover vigor, a drink is prepared as follows: Lechi,\r\nkuili powder, asparagus racemosus, cucumber, and kanta-gokhru: mixed\r\nwith milk.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApplications that, in the estimation of the Ananga-Ranga, are of value\r\nas phallic stimulants, include leaves of the jai, rui seed, honey, lotus\r\nflower pollen, Hungarian grass, and anise.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLoha-Bhasma is a preparation of ferrous oxide and is used, according to\r\nHindu erotologists, as a priapic stimulant.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn herb indigenous to India, known botanically as maerua arenaria, is\r\nconsidered beneficial in inducing amatory inclination.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDespite Hindu proscriptions against the consumption of meat, meat is\r\nfrequently mentioned in Hindu texts as an erotic agent, particularly\r\nred, lean meat.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nArrack is an Indian liquor prepared from the flowers of the Moh tree,\r\nthat are rich in sugar content. The Moh tree, botanically Bassia\r\nlatifolia, is used in a recipe for physiological renewal. The pith is\r\npounded and, with cow’s milk, taken as a drink.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn India, opium, that is, papaver somniferum, has been used as a phallic\r\nexcitation, although a sixteenth century Dutch traveler, Linschoten, who\r\nwas familiar with the East and the West Indies, asserted that it\r\ndiminishes the libido.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA phallic application is costus arabicus, powdered raktabol, which is\r\nmyrrh, borax, aniseed, and manishil, mixed with oil of sesame.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA lotion of juice of the roots of the madayanlika plant, the anjanika\r\nplant, yellow amaranth, the shlakshnaparni plant, and the clitoria\r\nternateea.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA help in amatory experimentation is the following: The sprouts of the\r\nvajnasunhi plant are cut into small strips. They are then dipped in a\r\nmixture of sulphur and red arsenic, and dried seven times. The resultant\r\npowder is now burned at night; when the smoke rises, if a golden moon is\r\nobserved behind the fumes, success will attend the erotic encounter.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA composition of long pepper, seeds of the plant sanseviera\r\nroxburghiana, and seeds of the plant hedysarum gangeticum, pounded and\r\nmixed with milk.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVarious soups are advised, in Hindu erotology, as strengthing\r\nministrants. Particularly so, soups in which the ingredients are cheese,\r\nor fish, or celery, or mushrooms, or lentils, or onions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDill, which botanically is anthum graveolens, is an Eastern ingredient\r\nfor furthering the libido.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo Hindu erotologists, all amatory acts, the cult of the phallus, and\r\nerotic performances, are under the aegis of the triune god Trimurti.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTrapa bispinosa, which is a nut belonging in the water chestnut species,\r\nis frequently used in amatory composition. The paste is prepared from\r\nthe seeds or roots of the trapa bispinosa, kasurika, tuscan jasmine, and\r\nliquorice, and a bulb called kshirakapoli. The whole is mixed with milk,\r\nghee, and sugar: then boiled into a consistency.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWine, in India, is considered conducive to priapic performance. But\r\nonly, as among the Greeks and the Romans and the ancient Hebrews, when\r\ntaken in moderation. Otherwise, excessive drinking of wine is an object\r\nof condemnation. A rule in Hindu ritual establishes the criterion of\r\nsufficiency:\r\n\r\n               So long as the mind’s light flickers not,\r\n               For so long drink! Shun the rest!\r\n               Whoso drinks still more is a beast.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a defensive measure against erotic aggressiveness, Hindu erotology\r\nsuggests the following procedure. The woman who is the prospective\r\nobject of an amatory approach should bathe in the buttermilk of a male\r\nbuffalo. The milk is mixed with powder of yellow amaranth, the\r\nbanu-padika plant, and the gopalika plant.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCinnamon is the dried inner bark of an East Indian tree. In addition to\r\nits use as a condiment, cinnamon has been credited with amatory\r\nimplications.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Atharva Veda_ is a Sanskrit text dealing with thaumaturgic\r\nprocedures, magic formulas, incantations, and prescriptions affecting\r\nvarious emotional circumstances. A magic invocation, intended to excite\r\nfeminine passion in a particular woman, runs this:\r\n\r\n    With the all-powerful arrow of Love do I pierce thy heart, O\r\n    woman! Love, love that causes unease, that will overcome thee,\r\n    love for me! That arrow, flying true and straight, will cause in\r\n    thee burning desire. It has the point of my love, its shaft is\r\n    my determination to possess thee!\r\n\r\n    Yea, thy heart is pierced. The arrow has struck home. I have\r\n    overcome by these arts thy reluctance, thou art changed! Come to\r\n    me, submissive, without pride, but only longing! Thy mother will\r\n    be powerless to prevent thy coming, neither shall thy father be\r\n    able to prevent thee! Thou art completely in my power.\r\n\r\n    O Mitra, O Varuna, strip her of will power! I, I alone, wield\r\n    power over the heart and mind of my beloved!\r\n\r\nA woman, on the other hand, may secure a man’s love by the following\r\nsupplication:\r\n\r\n    I am possessed by burning love for this man: and this love comes\r\n    to me from Apsaras, who is victorious ever. Let the man yearn\r\n    for me, desire me, let his desire burn for me! Let this love\r\n    come forth from the spirit, and enter him.\r\n\r\n    Let him desire me as nothing has been desired before! I love\r\n    him, want him: he must feel this same desire for me!\r\n\r\n    O Maruts, let him become filled with love. O Spirit of the Air,\r\n    fill him with love. O Agni, let him burn with love for me!\r\n\r\nA variant supplication directed toward a similar purpose is the\r\nfollowing, from the same source as the two previous invocations:\r\n\r\n    By the power and Laws of Varuna I invoke the burning force of\r\n    love, in thee, for thee. The desire, the potent love-spirit\r\n    which all the gods have created in the waters, this I invoke,\r\n    this I employ, to secure thy love for me!\r\n\r\n    Indrani has magnetized the waters with this love-force.\r\n\r\n    And it is that, by Varuna’s Laws, that I cause to burn!\r\n\r\n    Thou wilt love me, with a burning desire.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn its religious traditions, India has affinities with the earliest\r\nknown forms of sacred rites, concepts, and views. In Hindu religious\r\nmythology, the cosmic power of creation, of the generative capacity, is\r\nsymbolized by the duality of the hermaphrodite, the male and female\r\nintertwined, sharing the properties of each other, representing the\r\npassive and active principles that pervade all Nature.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the testimony furnished by bas-reliefs in caves such as the Ajanta\r\ncaverns, by temple carvings, paintings, and sculptural adornments, the\r\ncult of the lingam, throughout India, appears to date back to a very\r\nremote and undetermined antiquity.\r\n\r\nAmong certain sects, the supreme power is worshipped in the phallic\r\nform. In wayside lodges, on facades and shrines, the genital figure of\r\nmasculine dominance is everywhere on view. In many instances this\r\nomnipresence and insistence of the symbolic phallus assume monstrously\r\nobscene forms and positions, writhing and contorted in erotic frenzy, or\r\nentwined in serpentine coils and performing abominations of the utmost\r\nlubricity in the name and under the aegis of the cosmic creative force.\r\n\r\nA remoter but still valid corollary is that the amatory urge derives\r\nfrom this universal generative process and strives to merge with it and\r\nhence seeks whatever erotic measures and manipulations may be favorable\r\nto such a consummation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Benares, Jagannath, and elsewhere in India, the deities of generation\r\nwere held in great reverence, and were worshipped, notably by women, who\r\nsymbolically, and more frequently actually, consorted with, for\r\ninstance, Vishnu, at a nocturnal ceremony during the annual celebrations\r\nheld in his honor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Atharva Veda_, the Sanskrit magic text, contains an invocation\r\nwhereby a woman appeals for a husband:\r\n\r\n    I seek a husband. Sitting here, my hair flowing loose, I am like\r\n    one positioned before a giant procession, searching for a\r\n    husband for this woman without a spouse.\r\n\r\n    O Aryaman! This woman cannot longer bear to attend the marriages\r\n    of other women. Now, having performed this rite, other women\r\n    will come to the wedding-feast of hers!\r\n\r\n    The Creator holds up the Earth, the planets, the Heavens.\r\n\r\n    O Creator, produce for me a suitor, a husband.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Atharva Veda_ also recommends a talisman made from sraktya wood, to\r\nbe used in supplication to all the divinities of the Hindu pantheon,\r\nwith these words:\r\n\r\n    And this great and powerful talisman does strike to victory\r\n    wherever it is used. It produces children, fecundity, security,\r\n    fortunes!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother Hindu invocation, in the text of the _Atharva Veda_, contains an\r\namatory appeal for a wife:\r\n\r\n    I take upon myself strength, strength of a hundred men. I take\r\n    up this power in the name of the spirit that comes here, that is\r\n    coming, that has come. O Indra, give me that strength!\r\n\r\n    As the Asvins took Surya, the child of Savitar, to be a bride,\r\n    so has destiny said that here shall come a wife for this man!\r\n    Indra, with that hook of gold, of power, bring here a wife for\r\n    him that desires a wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n                   VARIETIES AND OCCASIONS OF POTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlciphron, an Athenian writer who flourished during the second century\r\nA.D., composed a number of light, unpretentious letters dealing with\r\nsimple daily occupations and subjects and characters of everyday life:\r\nfarmers, courtesans, barbers, fishermen, parasites.\r\n\r\nThey deal with all sorts of intimate and personal matters, and are a\r\nmarvelous reflection of the lower strata of antiquity. In one of these\r\nletters the girl Myrrhina writes to her friend Nikippe. Myrrhina\r\ncomplains that her lover Diphilus has abandoned her. He has been on a\r\ndrinking spree for four days. To make matters worse, he has fallen for\r\nthe jade Thessala.\r\n\r\nHence Myrrhina pleads with Nikippe to aid her in her perplexity.\r\nNikippe, it appears, has a love-potion, that she has often used\r\nsuccessfully on young but hesitant lovers. That is what Myrrhina now\r\nwants. It will banish Diphilus’ interest in drink and rid him of his\r\ninfatuation with Thessala.\r\n\r\nMyrrhina is going to write an endearing, enticing letter to Diphilus.\r\nWhen, as a result, he comes to visit her, she will use the love-potion\r\non him. She admits, however, that these love philtres are uncertain in\r\ntheir effects. Sometimes, she adds, they cause sudden death. But what\r\ndoes Myrrhina care? Diphilus must either live for Myrrhina or die for\r\nhis Thessala.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGestures and action, lascivious and lewd in intent, may be virtual\r\npotions in their immediate provocations. So Ovid, the arch-counsellor in\r\namatory diversions, suggests in Book 3 of the _Amores_. Archness\r\nassumed, prudery, coyness, and an air of hesitation in acquiescence will\r\nprove all the greater stimulants:\r\n\r\n           Be more advised, walk as a puritan,\r\n           And I shall think you chaste, do what you can.\r\n           Slip still, only deny it when ’tis done,\r\n           And, before folk, immodest speeches shun.\r\n           The bed is for lascivious toyings meet,\r\n           There use all tricks, and tread shame under feet.\r\n           When you are up and dressed, be sage and grave,\r\n           And in the bed hide all the faults you have.\r\n           Be not ashamed to strip you, being there,\r\n           And mingle thighs, yours ever mine to bear.\r\n           There in your rosy lips my tongue entomb,\r\n           Practice a thousand sports when there you come.\r\n           Forbear no wanton words you there would speak,\r\n           And with your pastime let the bedstead creak;\r\n           But with your robes put on an honest face,\r\n           And blush, and seem as you were full of grace.\r\n           Deceive all; let me err; and think I’m right,\r\n           And like a wittol think thee void of slight.\r\n           Why see I lines so oft received and given?\r\n           This bed and that by tumbling made uneven?\r\n           Like one start up your hair tost and displaced,\r\n           And with a wantons tooth your neck new-rased.\r\n           Grant this, that what you do I may not see;\r\n           If you weigh not ill speeches, yet weigh me.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe erotic power, the essential property that possessed the virtue of\r\nenflaming desire and exciting sensual emotions, was believed, anciently\r\nand in later ages, to reside in growing things, in the produce of the\r\nearth, in the teeming abundance of the ocean, in metals, in essences,\r\nand in intricate and cunningly contrived combinations, mixtures, and\r\namalgams of such matter.\r\n\r\nThe common onion, that normally was a part of a simple daily meal,\r\nacquired, among the Greeks, amatory virtues. The onion, in fact, rose\r\nfrom its lowly status as a gastronomic item to a mystically-endowed\r\nroot, that could inspire and direct erotic sensations. Alexis, a writer\r\nof comedies who flourished in the third century B.C., dwells on its\r\nhighly effective nature.\r\n\r\nAnother Greek comic writer, Diphilus, of the third century B.C.,\r\nlikewise says of onions: They are hard to digest, though nourishing and\r\nstrengthening to the stomach. They are cleansing also, but they have a\r\nweakening effect on the sight. In addition, they stimulate sexual\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nThe pungency of pepper is relished gastronomically. But pepper had\r\nanother use apart from its function as a condiment. It was pounded, then\r\nmixed with nettle-seed, and in this form it was regularly taken by the\r\nGreeks as a means of promoting intercourse.\r\n\r\nWine has for ages been lauded poetically and convivially, and a vintage\r\nmeant, as a rule, a matter for gastronomic appreciation. But old wine,\r\nwith the addition of ground pyrethron—which is botanically feverfew or\r\npellitory, was known to the Hellenic people as a particularly powerful\r\nerotic potion.\r\n\r\nSuch draughts, however, had then more sinister applications as well, and\r\nnot infrequently they were considered injurious physiologically. This\r\nwas, in fact, the considered view of the Roman poet Ovid, of the first\r\ncentury B.C. In contrast to such a potion, he asserts, there are quite\r\ninnocuous aphrodisiac stimulants, among them: eggs, wild cabbage,\r\nstone-pine apples, and honey.\r\n\r\nTo discover a plant that, unexpectedly and arousingly, ‘kindles the\r\nflame of love,’ must have been a revelation to the ancient Greeks. Such\r\na plant was pyrethron, so named because it was such an inflammatory\r\nstimulant.\r\n\r\nIt was also known as pyrethrum parthenium, and was largely used for\r\nmedicinal purposes.\r\n\r\nIn modern terminology, this plant is identified with pellitory.\r\n\r\nIn Arab countries pyrethrum was pounded and mixed with lilac ointment\r\nand ginger: and the resultant compound served to produce erotic\r\nstimulation in the genital area.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his determined search for amatory satisfactions, man has probed\r\ndeeply into the material world and also into conceptual zones. Thus\r\nerotic stimulation may be produced by an inspired dream. This is the\r\nsituation in a comedy by the Greek poet Aristophanes, who flourished in\r\nthe fifth century B.C. The play has survived in fragments only, but may\r\nbe pieced together into some degree of cohesion, the theme being the\r\nproblem of an old man who has a young wife. The aged husband makes a\r\npilgrimage to the oracle of Amphiaraus. As a result of his visit, the\r\nsolution of the marital perplexity is revealed in a dream, and the\r\nvirility of the elder is restored. In the scattered fragments, there is\r\na suggestion of the means adopted by the husband. It took the form of a\r\ndish of lentils.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA visual spectacle may virtually act as a potion. This is the view of a\r\nphysician named Theodorus Priscianus. He flourished in the fourth\r\ncentury A.D., and was the author of a medical handbook, still extant, in\r\nwhich he gives realistic advice for a cure of incapacity. Let the\r\npatient, he counsels, in Book 2, be surrounded by beautiful girls or\r\nboys. Also, give him books to read that arouse lust and in which love\r\nstories are insinuatingly treated.\r\n\r\nVirtually, such treatment approximates a visual love-potion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPhysical therapy may be as affective as a potion. Hence local massage,\r\nin the inguinal area, was often performed as an aid in inducing\r\nvirility. This was a highly popular manipulation. It is alluded to in\r\nancient writers, and particularly so in the Greek comic poet\r\nAristophanes. Petronius, too, the author of the Latin novel entitled the\r\n_Satyricon_, describes such an operation performed by an old beldam on\r\none of the characters, named Encolpius.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBlood has sinister and calamitous implications: yet it is also\r\nassociated with erotic deviations. Blood, the mere visual presentation\r\nof it, may produce strong amatory symptoms. The public brothels in\r\nancient Rome, for instance, were established over the Circus in which\r\ngladiatorial contests were on view. The sight of the violent scenes\r\nenacted in these conflicts manifestly bestirred the blood lust, and\r\nequally the sexual urge of the masses of spectators, who subsequently\r\nthronged the lupanaria. Similarly, in Spain, brothels were built in\r\nclose proximity to the bull-rings. There was, here too, a manifest\r\nassociation between the frenzy of the tauromachia and the resultant\r\nlustful esurgence among the spectators.\r\n\r\nAgain, the perversion of flagellation involves blood. The resultant flow\r\nof blood, after whippings and lashings had been inflicted upon more or\r\nless willing victims by perverts and sadists, produced extraordinary\r\nerotic excitations. Scenes of this type are the stock in trade of the\r\nnovelists the Marquis de Sade and Sacher-Masoch.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDescribing an amorous intrigue with the maid Fotis, Lucius, the\r\nprotagonist of the _Metamorphoses_, Apuleius’ Roman novel, adds, in\r\nrespect of the effect of wine;\r\n\r\n    We would eftsoones refresh our wearinesse and provoke our\r\n    pleasure, and renew our venery by drinking of wine.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe primary, uncomplicated fact of life is its continuity through\r\nphysiological relationships. But on this basis man has erected and\r\ndeveloped ponderous and multiple ramifications of such functional\r\nassociations, involving more than the primary purpose and activity of\r\nprocreation. He has, in addition, an instinctual urge toward affection,\r\nlove, desire, and lust. And these emotional manifestations have, in the\r\ncourse of time, become refined or coarsened or diverted into abnormal\r\nchannels. In his efforts to achieve love or desire or lust and its\r\nconsummations, he has exposed himself to the natural progressive\r\ndegradation and impairment of his physiological capacities: and he has\r\nno less abused, weakened, or destroyed this force or energy.\r\n\r\nHence his febrile search for some undefined amelioration of his\r\ncondition or some method or contrivance, however insecure, unwarranted,\r\nor barbaric, for recovering his instinctual erotic sensuality.\r\n\r\nGullibly and trustingly man has proceeded in this quest to restore the\r\nerosions and defects consequent on time and excess. What direction does\r\nthis quest take? It is ubiquitous. It leaves no stone unturned, no faint\r\npossibility untested. It is prepared to make a trial of every novel\r\nfantasy, or any inspired scheme, any exploded myth, or every remote and\r\nfragile clue. In temples dedicated for the purpose he will repeat\r\ncryptic supplications to unknown, foreign, forbidding gods. Or he\r\nassumes on his person, in constant hope, periapts and amulets, inscribed\r\nwith awesome symbols, gateways to the Mysteries. There arise occasions\r\nwhen he urgently consults aged and knowledgeable enchantresses, who\r\nreputedly possess the secrets of life and love. Or he is encouraged to\r\ndrink certain fertilizing waters, drawn from mystic founts, from\r\nunderground rivers. He may make silent prayers at wishing wells. Appeals\r\nto the deities associated with love or frantic lust, with prostitution\r\nand sexual deviations are his constant practices, in all countries, in\r\nBoeotia as well as in Bactria, in Egypt no less than in Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\nErotic stimuli sometimes sprang from the human figure itself, without\r\nthe intrusion of contrived philtres or other adventitious aids. The\r\nGreeks, in particular, in drama and comedy, in poetry and sculpture,\r\nlavished endless praise on the seductiveness of various areas of the\r\nfeminine person. The callipygian Greek girl was the subject of exultant\r\nerotic paeans. Contests were held in which callipygian rivals vied for\r\npublic recognition and acclamation. There was no sense of shamefulness,\r\nno prudish primness, and, equally, there was no stimulated prurience,\r\nfor beauty per se had no restrictions, no taboos, no amorality attached\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThe theme of callipygia, in fact, runs through Greek life. The\r\nencyclopedist Athenaeus mentions two young country girls whose\r\nattractions in marriage rested with their callipygian forms. The\r\ncitizens actually called these women _callipygoi_. Even Aphrodite, in\r\nher temple at Syracuse, was called Aphrodite Kallipygos. In one of the\r\nlively, revealing letters of Alciphron, two girls, Myrrhine and\r\nThryallis, dispute over their own personal charms in this respect, while\r\na number of poems, including one in the Greek anthology, laud the same\r\narea.\r\n\r\nSculptors and poets dwelt with an appreciative eye, free from personal\r\nlustfulness, on the rhythmic flow and alluring harmony of hip and thigh,\r\nof neck and ankles. The female breasts were figuratively described as\r\napples, or the fruit of the strawberry tree. In the pastoral poet\r\nTheocritus, who belongs in the third century B.C. a young lover,\r\nDaphnis, speaks of the heaving apples of his girl friend.\r\n\r\nThere is the story of the famous Athenian courtesan Phryne, who was\r\ncondemned to death in a court of law. Her life was saved, however, when\r\nher counsel, who was also her lover, Hyperides, exposed her beautiful\r\nbosom before the overwhelmed judges.\r\n\r\nThe term potion was in itself so closely associated with amatory\r\nproficiency or, on occasion, as a medicinal remedy for some other\r\nphysiological condition, that its use was rarely questioned. The potion,\r\nhowever, might be deadly and might be concocted as a rapid means for the\r\nelimination of a rival, or a husband, or some enemy. Such a situation\r\noccurs in Book 10 of Apuleius’ _Metamorphoses_:\r\n\r\n    The woman having lost the name of wife together with her faith,\r\n    went to a traiterous Physitian, who had killed a great many\r\n    persons in his dayes, and promised him fifty peeces of Gold, if\r\n    he would give her a present poyson to kill her Husband out of\r\n    hand, but in presence of her husband, she feined that it was\r\n    necessary for him to receive a certaine kind of drink, which the\r\n    Maisters and Doctours of Physicke doe call a sacred potion, to\r\n    the intent he might purge Choller and scoure the interiour parts\r\n    of his body. But the Physitian in stead of that drinke prepared\r\n    a mortall and deadly poyson, and when he had tempered it\r\n    accordingly, he tooke the pot in the presence of the family, and\r\n    other neighbors and friends of the sick young man, and offered\r\n    it to his patient.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo further the efficacy of potions, and also to act as indirect yet\r\nacknowledged reinforcements, aischrological and scatological allusions\r\nand references were frequent accompaniments of the actual act of\r\nimbibing the philtre.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOmar Khayyam, the wise old tentmaker, eulogized, in the Rubaiyat, food\r\nand love and wine in the memorable lines:\r\n\r\n                     A loaf of bread,\r\n                     A jug of wine\r\n                       And thou, beneath the bough,\r\n                     Were paradise enow.\r\n\r\nThe medieval Latin songs of the Goliards, the wandering students of the\r\nEuropean universities, are full of paeans to drink and its amatory\r\neffects. Love and wine are inextricably mixed together in riotous and\r\nrollicking friendship. Everyone, exclaims one chant, is drinking: man\r\nand maid, master and serf, the sick and the healthy, young and old:\r\n\r\n                      Bibit hera, bibit herus,\r\n                      Bibit miles, bibit clerus,\r\n                      Bibit ille, bibit illa,\r\n                      Bibit servus cum ancilla,\r\n                      Bibit velox, bibit piger,\r\n                      Bibit albus, bibit niger,\r\n                      Bibit constans, bibit vagus,\r\n                      Bibit rudis, bibit magus,\r\n                      Bibit pauper et aegrotus,\r\n                      Bibit exsul et ignotus,\r\n                      Bibit puer, bibit canus,\r\n                      Bibit praesul, et decanus,\r\n                      Bibit soror, bibit frater,\r\n                      Bibit anus, bibit mater,\r\n                      Bibit ista, bibit ille,\r\n                      Bibunt centum, bibunt mille.\r\n\r\nThe intimate association between wine and love, as if by a chain of\r\ncausality, has been established since proto-historical times. All\r\nancient records, chronicles, supplications, ceremonials abundantly\r\nexemplify this thematic synthesis. Especially so in poetry, of all\r\nnations, and at all times.\r\n\r\n                    Drink to me only with thine eyes\r\n                    and I will pledge with mine\r\n\r\nis merely a transposed symbolic formula for the same theme.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll kinds of foods have in the course of history been subjected to\r\nscrutiny and experiment for the purpose of extracting therefrom any\r\nindications of amatory incitements. Thus, out of the welter of magic\r\nundercurrents and legendary beliefs, superstitious rites and alchemical\r\nofferings, there arose a body of miscellaneous knowledge, largely orally\r\ntransmitted but in time consolidated into a permanently durable form,\r\ndealing with periapts and panaceas that would bring back or conserve\r\nmanly vigor and genesiac capacities.\r\n\r\nAmong such potential means were anchovies, credited with provoking lust,\r\nonion soup and herring roe, milk pudding. Angel water also was so\r\nconsidered. It was shaken together with rose water, myrtle water, orange\r\nflower water, distilled spirit of musk, and spirit of ambergris. To the\r\ngenitalia of the stag were attributed amatory qualities. Rockets, cakes\r\nand pastries of phallic and genital design, chocolate and ices, pills\r\ncompounded of vegetable extracts, burgundy and richly garnished game\r\ncame under the same energizing category.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn South East Asia, particularly in what was formerly Cambodia, annual\r\nspring festivals were held during which a gigantic lingam was carried\r\nprocessionally through the streets. At the ghats in the holy cities of\r\nIndia, notably at Benares, the sacred lingam was displayed publicly by\r\nthe Brahmin priests. Around these symbols clustered Hindu women on\r\npilgrimage, wreathing the phallic shape in flowers, smearing it with\r\nghee. And among the throngs strode the priests, bearing phallic forms\r\nfor the adoration and prostration of the people. Temple girls, bedecked\r\nwith tinkling anklets, and with beringed fingers, advanced, swaying and\r\nwrithing voluptuously. In similar ceremonies there was food to be\r\nconsumed, and drink flowed; followed, on the part of the initiates, by a\r\ngeneral indiscriminate promiscuity that was intended to represent\r\nspiritual identification with the Hindu deities. The erotic urgencies\r\nnever rested, never rest: and the act becomes a sublimation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe phallic cult, as the basic recognition of the creative potency, is\r\npervasively manifest, in every continent, throughout all distinctions of\r\nsociety. In New Guinea, huts are adorned with a phallus. In the South\r\nSea Islands huge monolithic columns testify to the indigenous worship of\r\nthe generative force. In some areas of Arabia tombs are adorned with the\r\nphallus and are treated with sacrosanct adoration by the women. The\r\nDruses, in ceremonial chants at night, pay honor and homage to the yoni,\r\nand particularly to the consummation on the sacred Friday, as enjoined\r\nby Islam. In Tahiti, secret rites are held, in a corresponding sense, in\r\nhonor of the physiological act.\r\n\r\nGreece had its processional mystai, male and female votaries of Bacchus,\r\nleading asses or goats, while young maids carried baskets of\r\nfirst-fruits and genital-shaped cakes. And a sequence of men, their\r\nheads wreathed in ivy or acanthus, bore a fig-wood triple phallus of the\r\ngod.\r\n\r\nFrom Phrygia the cult had anciently spread to Etruria, where the obscene\r\ndeity, according to Augustine and Arnobius, was the phallic Mutunus with\r\nhis consort Mutuna.\r\n\r\nFrom Etruria the cult extended riotously to Rome and its far-flung\r\nfrontiers, from Lambaesis to Dacia, from Bithynia to Pannonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n                          POTENCY OF PHILTRES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe potion is primarily the instrument of lust. Lust is the universal\r\ndriving force, the cosmic mainspring. The pudenda muliebria, states the\r\nBible, are among the insatiable things on this earth. Plato, the Greek\r\nphilosopher, in his dialogue entitled _Timaeus_, confirms this eternally\r\nunappeased genital passion:\r\n\r\n    In men the organ of generation, becoming rebellious and\r\n    masterful, like an animal disobedient to reason, and maddened\r\n    with the sting of lust, seeks to gain absolute sway; and the\r\n    same is the case with the so-called womb or matrix of women; the\r\n    animal within them is desirous of procreating children, and when\r\n    remaining unfruitful long beyond the proper time, gets\r\n    discontented and angry, and wandering in every direction through\r\n    the body, closes up the passages of breath, and, by obstructing\r\n    respiration, drives them to extremity, causing all varieties of\r\n    disease, until at length the desire and love of the man and the\r\n    woman bringing them together and as it were plucking the fruit\r\n    from the trees, sow in the womb, as in a field, animals unseen\r\n    by reason of their smallness and without form; these again are\r\n    separated and matured within; they are then finally brought out\r\n    into the light, and thus the generation of animals is completed.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf all potions, satyrion is associated, in legend and mythology, with\r\nthe most numerous and consecutive effects. There was a story of an\r\noriental king. It is related in Book 9 of the _Enquiry into Plants_, by\r\nTheophrastus, who flourished in the third century B.C. The king had sent\r\na gift of satyrion to Antiochus, ruler of Syria. The slave-messenger who\r\ncarried the plant was himself so affected by it that he performed\r\nseventy coital operations in succession.\r\n\r\nIn respect of this same root there was another anecdote about a certain\r\nProculus. After drinking a satyrion concoction, Proculus performed on\r\none hundred women in fifteen days.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWines, liqueurs, and in general all kinds of spirits are, both in\r\nfictional contexts and in the chronicles of the eighteenth century,\r\nconsidered as salacious tonics, and were so used specifically. Even an\r\noccasional drink of wine had an erotic repute.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the salacious and scatological novels of the Marquis de Sade,\r\nespecially in Justine and in Les 120 Journées de Sodome, food is\r\nrepeatedly stressed as immediately contributory to high amatory potency.\r\nRepletion, it appears, corresponds directly to amatory responses. De\r\nSade describes, in lavish and appreciative detail, with a kind of\r\npersonal gusto and even participation, dinner after dinner, in which\r\ncourses follow each other in almost numberless and uninterrupted\r\nsequence: roasts of all varieties, game in season, and also out of\r\nseason, hors d’oeuvre, pastries of fantastic shape and ingredients, ices\r\nand chocolates. Each course is accompanied with appropriate wines and\r\nbrandies. Rhenish and Greek and Italian vintages, burgundy and\r\nchampagne, tokay and madeira.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd, both synchronously with the meal, and as an aftermath of the\r\nbanquets, the plenitude of food and drink and the total satiety of the\r\ndiners produce an enormously exciting, urgent, and effective erotic\r\nreaction, in which not only the guests but the maidservants as well are\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nA soup compounded of celery and truffles was a favorite and popular dish\r\nin eighteenth century France, when every possible aphrodisiac aid was\r\neagerly sought and tested.\r\n\r\nNo less so was lentil soup in great demand for the same purpose. Bean\r\nsoup, also, pea soup, and other vegetable assortments were regularly\r\nemployed in culinary ways, but with a decided erotic suggestiveness.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEighteenth century France, in fact, experimented in both amatory and\r\ngastronomic directions, for one practice was manifestly associated with\r\nthe other. All manner of compounds, then, prepared for amatory vigor,\r\nwere produced on a large scale. These concoctions invariably included\r\nvinegars, perfumed lotions, electuaries, and strengthening elixirs.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Portuguese potion, that was in frequent use in the eighteenth century,\r\nconsisted of a pint of rose water, shaken together with a pint of orange\r\nflower water and a half pint of myrtle water. To this were added two\r\nthirds of spirit of ambergris and two thirds of distilled spirit of\r\nmusk. The result was reputedly a potent concoction.\r\n\r\nAsiatic races were long known for their sexual prowess. Hence the West,\r\nthrough travelers and explorers and adventurers, was eager to acquire\r\nsuch knowledge in its own interests. In the case of the Asiatic Tartars,\r\nthere were accounts of their strange practices. In one instance, they\r\nused the membrum of the wild horse for its reputed high content of vital\r\nfluid. The genitalia of the stag, itself considered an extremely\r\nlibidinous animal, were similarly regarded.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the case of highly responsive natures, a mere inhalation of a\r\nparticular perfume, or the sight of a desired person, may produce\r\nextreme erotic symptoms. This was so with Antiochus, son of King\r\nSeleucus, who reigned in the third century B.C. Merely hearing the name\r\nof his mistress uttered aloud was sufficient to induce in him the\r\nultimate amatory reactions.\r\n\r\nThe amatory urge has been, in the history of man, of such forceful and\r\nuninterrupted universality that, in special cases and in specific areas\r\nof activity, there have been devised anti-aphrodisiac means, formal\r\nprescriptions, herbal and other concoctions, and well-meant counsel.\r\nVerbena in a drink was formerly recommended as a specific preventive.\r\nAlso dried mint and vinegar and the juice of hemlock. Cucumbers, too,\r\nand water melon have at various times been considered effective in\r\ndiminishing or allaying sensual interests. In a general sense, whatever\r\nexhausts the body physiologically or mentally has been considered as a\r\nfeasible amatory restriction. In this category are included laborious\r\nand persistent work that occupies all the waking energies: a minimum of\r\nsleep, or fasting, or a restricted diet, or exercise of the body: even\r\ncastigation.\r\n\r\nThe problem was equally well known to the ancients, who advised, to\r\ncounteract the heat engendered by passionate excitation, a prescription\r\ninvolving cold. Hence the cold bath was a common and recognized\r\nprocedure and was adopted, centuries later, as a regular feature in\r\nAnglo-Saxon mores. Other Greeks, among them the philosophers Plato and\r\nhis successor Aristotle, suggested that going barefoot would diminish\r\nthe heat-producing physiological desire. Another suggestion was to wear\r\nsheets of lead, beaten out thin, near the kidneys or on the legs. Pliny\r\nthe Elder, the Roman encyclopedist and author of the monumental\r\n_Historia Naturalis_, and the eminent Greek physician Galen, both\r\ncoincided in this view.\r\n\r\nA more difficult procedure, but one commended by the seventeenth century\r\nSir Thomas Browne, was self-restraint in the ‘flaming days,’ as he calls\r\nthem. Otherwise, there remains one other remedy, that was adopted by\r\nOrigen, the third century A.D. Father of the Church. He cut the Gordian\r\nknot, freeing himself from all carnal inducements: Seeds genitalibus\r\nmembris, eunuchum se facit.\r\n\r\nIngenious inventions, activities, devices for escaping from or\r\nsuppressing compulsive amatory inclinations have been proposed in every\r\nage, from the arch poet of love Ovid himself to the knowledgeable Dr.\r\nNicolas Venette.\r\n\r\nShun idleness, for idleness tends to amatory thoughts, warns the\r\nerotological poet. Be active, and you will not be endangered. Occupy\r\nyourself constantly: with agricultural pursuits, or fishing, or hunting.\r\nOr even take up the study of law.\r\n\r\nAvoid food that tends to stimulate: and, in general, live an ascetic\r\nlife removed from crowds, from visual provocations, from social parties\r\nand clamorous public spectacles and dramatic performances, from\r\npictorial or sculptural objects that induce amatory images.\r\n\r\nSnuff taking is suggested, as well as concentrated mental study, in\r\nlater centuries. Or drink a concoction of the roots and seeds of the\r\nwater lily. That is soothing and cooling, as the Turks seemed to have\r\nfound it.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAromatic herbs were, in ancient Rome, usually a preliminary to more\r\nactive amatory adventures. The osphresiological sensitivity of men and\r\nwomen is such that in many cases particular aromas, strong unguents and\r\ncosmetics, arouse venereal impulses. In perverted and aberrational\r\nsituations, in fact, even repellent but powerful effluvia and vapors,\r\ncorporeal and genital, may create or induce erotic susceptibility. The\r\nOriental manuals of erotology and certain anthropological studies\r\nconfirm this view.\r\n\r\nA strange personality who was himself European in origin but merged with\r\nthe East was the writer Lafcadio Hearn. In the course of his essays,\r\ntranslations, and interpretations he produced a brief thesis on feminine\r\nosphresiological influence.\r\n\r\nThe Roman novelist Apuleius, who belongs in the second century A.D., was\r\naccused of marrying a wealthy widow named Pudentilla, by magic rites. He\r\nthus answered his accuser:\r\n\r\n    He said that I was the only one found capable of defiling her\r\n    widowhood, as if it were virginity, by my incantations and love\r\n    philtres.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWoman became so masterful, so pervasively dominant in her relations with\r\nher masculine counterpart, that she came to reflect man’s primary\r\nphysiological desire. She became equated with erotic passion and\r\nfulfillment, and her urgency grew so intense that all roads were\r\ndirected toward her as the ultimate pleasure, the sensual summum bonum.\r\nShe was in the medieval dialectical sense, matter in actu. And when the\r\nphysiological and amatory capacities of the male became, through\r\nexcessive practice or through incidental incapacities or aberrations and\r\nindiscretions, markedly weakened and deficient, there was instant and\r\nfrantic resort to any means, to all means, whereby this defect or\r\nincapacity might be corrected or possibly completely remedied. Hence the\r\nfebrile, the universal quest, in every land and at all cultural levels,\r\nfor aids and persuasive spells and secret incantations, thaumaturgic\r\nformulas and brews, elixirs and anticipated panaceas.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSprings, rivers, lakes, wells, and fountains have had at various times a\r\nkind of miraculous or thaumaturgic repute as an efficacious amatory\r\nstimulant. The Khirgiz of Central Asia, for instance, have a legend that\r\na princess, after bathing in a sacred lake, became enceinte. Waters may\r\nthus be fruitful and fecundating. Aristotle himself relates that a pool\r\nhad the same effect on a bathing woman.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, the philosopher and occultist Albertus Magnus\r\ndescribes similar instances and similar potencies.\r\n\r\nIn India, barren women bathed in a sacred well. Similarly with the\r\nwaters of Sinuessa in Greece. Springs in Germany and Morocco and in\r\nFrance were likewise venerated for their traditional erotic efficacy.\r\n\r\nIn Hindu mythology, there are instances of women bathing in the holy\r\nRiver Ganges and losing their sterility. So in the aboriginal myths of\r\nAustralia. In the Fiji islands barren women bathe in the river and then\r\ntake a drink of saffron and carob bean.\r\n\r\nA similar tradition lingers in China, in the history of the Manchus. The\r\nlotus often appeared in their legends as a kind of confirmatory aid. In\r\nEgypt, in fact, the lotus was known as the wife of the Nile.\r\n\r\nIn both the West and the Orient, the personal will to be admired or\r\nloved is believed to be instrumental, in a perceptible degree, in\r\nproducing a corresponding impact on the object of the desire. Various\r\nprocedures are specified, each having its own effective possibilities.\r\nAn offering of a bouquet of red flowers, breathed upon three times by\r\nthe amorous giver, may prove highly favorable to his pursuit. Or a\r\nmusical serenade, equally in vogue in the Latin countries, in medieval\r\nEurope, and in the Middle East.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n              INGREDIENTS OF POTIONS. RECIPES. ANECDOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ingredients_\r\n\r\nWhat were the elements that, in combination, constituted the potion? Was\r\nthere a formal, hieratic prescription for its composition, faithfully\r\nfollowed, scrupulously administered, uniformly conclusive? Or was it a\r\nmore or less haphazard matter of collecting various essences and\r\ngrasses, roots and drugs and far-sought items, and then hopefully\r\nthrusting them upon the tremulous suppliant, the desperate lover, the\r\nurgent princeling or vagrant poet? The ancients, both in the\r\nMediterranean area and in the far-flung Asian territories, used\r\nvirtually the same species of ingredients, the same or analogous roots\r\nand extracts, enwrapped, to strengthen the efficacy, in goetic chants,\r\nin awesome invocations, supplications, persistent pleas, and even\r\nmenaces.\r\n\r\nSometimes the ingredients were abominable and repulsive in character,\r\nfor all growing and living things were grist to the occultist’s mill.\r\nAnimal and human excreta and genitalia were frequently brought under\r\ncontribution. Not rarely, exotic spices were garnered: or leaves from\r\ntrees that grew in distant regions: or objects otherwise difficult to\r\nobtain? such as the hair, or nail parings, or even more intimate and\r\nless mentionable items from the human body. The traditions associated\r\nwith the ingredients were manifestly read and studied and pondered over\r\nand memorized through the ages, and subsequently transmitted to later\r\ncenturies. So that by the Middle Ages there had been accumulated an\r\nimmense reservoir of available constituents: human and animal matter,\r\nherbs, genitalia, liquefied elements, excrement of ox and pig, of wolf,\r\ngoat, dog, and goose, of sheep, hen, mice, pigeon, and cow. To ensure\r\nthe validity of the potion, there would be a bewitchment of the entire\r\ncompound, accompanied by certain formal rituals. Formulas would be\r\ninscribed on certain phials and objects. Frog’s bones were popular in\r\nthis regard. The mandrake, that mystic root that was associated with\r\nsinister human origins and characteristics, the plant that was reputedly\r\nendowed with male and female properties, was a popular ingredient in the\r\nlove potion. Bryony was long used for the purpose, and, in later days,\r\ntobacco as well. Entrails of animals were no rarity. The more repellent\r\nthe object, the more salacious and lewd and priapic would be the effect.\r\nFor the gasping, excited recipient, nothing was too foul, nothing too\r\nobnoxious, nothing too horrendous. What did matter was its aphrodisiac\r\nvalue. Hence the powdered heart of a roasted humming bird had its\r\npotency. Or the liver of a sparrow. The kidney of a hare was a frequent\r\naddition to the sum total of decayed and decaying tissue. Or the womb of\r\na swallow, that itself required minute preparation, was a prompt aid.\r\nHuman blood came into the picture, and the human heart and the fingers,\r\nas well as viscera, excrement, and urine, brain and skin and marrow.\r\nEven the Roman poets give a literary shudder at the mention, and in the\r\nmedieval chroniclers and encyclopedists there is equally a sense of\r\nrepulsion yet attraction. For love and passion generated from death and\r\noffal, and desire sprang from decay. Sappho, that ancient Greek poetess\r\nof Lesbos, knew the supremacy of this passion. She called Aphrodite\r\ndeathless, because love and life are co-eval and co-existent. The\r\nsweetest thing of all, she declares in one of her pieces, is to find\r\none’s lover. Ages later, Titus Lucretius Carus, the Roman Epicurean poet\r\nwho, in the first century B.C., produced that remarkable, profound epic,\r\n_De Rerum Natura_, The Nature of Things, begins his poem with an\r\ninvocation to fostering Venus, the delight of men and of gods.\r\n\r\nThe Orient, permeated by the same passions, had its own range of\r\ncontributory aphrodisiac elements. Betel-nut, chewed and blood-red, was\r\ncommonly a base for the philtre. Ambergris, touched with something\r\nmystic and elusive, played its creative, kinetic part. Some concoctions\r\nhad more earthy associations: for instance, the brains of a hoopee,\r\npounded into a cake, and devoured with hopeful zest. Or the wicks of\r\nlamps were inscribed with thaumaturgic invocations and then burned to\r\nensure their amatory efficacy.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDespite the motivating force of love, it was, in some instances, an\r\nobject of dread. For it was a widely disruptive agent, involving\r\nelements and features dangerous to the succumbing man and also to man’s\r\nsupremacy in his masculine context, his virile world. Hence in\r\nEuripides’ tragedy _Medea_ the chorus, speaking for the heroine, chants:\r\n\r\n    When in excess and past all limits Love doth come, he brings not\r\n    glory or repute to man; but if the Cyprian queen in moderate\r\n    might approach, no goddess is so full of charm as she. Never, O\r\n    never, lady mine, discharge at me from thy golden bow a shaft\r\n    invincible, in passion’s venom dipped.\r\n\r\nAgain, in confirmation of this view of passion, in Sophocles’ _Antigone_\r\nthe tragic and cataclysmic impact of love is bewailed by the murmurous\r\nchorus:\r\n\r\n    Love unconquered in the fight, Love, who makest havoc of wealth,\r\n    who keepest thy vigil on the soft cheek of a maiden; thou\r\n    roamest over the sea, and among the homes of dwellers in the\r\n    wilds; no immortal can escape thee, nor any among men whose life\r\n    is for a day; and he to whom thou hast come is mad.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThessaly, a region in northern Greece, was anciently known for sorcery\r\nand magic potencies. It was associated with witches and mystic\r\npractices, and its reputation for goety was so widespread, so deeply\r\nembedded in the region, that it continued far down into the Roman\r\nImperial age.\r\n\r\nAt night, the dead had to be guarded with great care, as these witches\r\nwere in the habit of tearing off pieces and shreds of flesh from the\r\ncorpse, and using them in concocting their potions.\r\n\r\nNecromancy, the multiple phases of the black arts, were normally\r\nbelieved to have come from Thessaly or to have found their sources\r\nthere. Thessaly, in fact, is, throughout ancient Greek literature, the\r\nfountain-head of magic. The Greek tragic poet Sophocles, for instance,\r\nand, later, the comic writer Menander allude to Thessalian magicians.\r\n\r\nThe Thessalian witch became almost a stock character, in bucolic poetry,\r\nin the drama, in legend. She is the supreme adept, and is so\r\nacknowledged. Among the later Romans, in particular, her stature is\r\nestablished. The elegiac poets Tibullus and Propertius, as well as Ovid,\r\nVergil, Horace, and Lucan cite her for her ubiquity, her constant\r\nparticipation in furtive manoeuvres, her intimacy with the foul and\r\nobscene and malevolent forces of the cosmos.\r\n\r\nThe Thessalian witch had notable skill in the selection and preparation\r\nof love potions. One of the most effective elements in such philtres was\r\ncatancy, a plant often mentioned in this connection. It should here be\r\nobserved that many factors in the composition of the potion are no\r\nlonger completely identifiable. Organic matter of course has universal\r\ndenotations: but obscure herbs, roots, spices, drugs belonged to a\r\nsecretive traditional pharmacopoeia that is no longer available in its\r\noriginal intact form.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the obscure depths and the furtive sinuosities of folk traditions and\r\ntransmitted superstitions and rites and formulas that succeeding\r\ngenerations accepted and cherished, the sex motif was always pervasive,\r\nunalterably dominant. The quest for amatory power, for refreshment and\r\nrecovery of the physiological apparatus, was uniformly directed to the\r\ntenebrous forces, the prescriptions and suggestions that would arouse\r\nthe erotic faculties and effect consummation of the passions of love or\r\naffection or desire.\r\n\r\nIn the slow progression of time this oral corpus of knowledge and these\r\nsecretive means of amorous enchantment and invigorating processes were\r\ncoordinated. They became imprinted in the written word. They were now\r\nestablished, durable. These compilations, that were in essence erotic\r\nhandbooks, were primarily intended for all the love-sick, the yearning\r\nyouth, the disappointed and effete libertine, the persistent aged\r\ndebauchee, the warped, distorted, and maleficent pursuers of Eros in his\r\nmost naked identity, of Priapus exultant and self-perpetuating. Nor was\r\nthis search for the remedial elixir delimited by time or circumstances.\r\nIt has, on the contrary, been continuous, and has flowed down from\r\nshadowy ancientness through the complexities of the Middle Ages, the\r\ntumultuous era of the Renaissance, which made life and letters\r\ncomplementary concomitants, down into these very present days, when the\r\nsearch is no less unending, in the laboratories, in mystic and\r\npseudo-mystic cults, in fantastic devices in the Chinese hinterland, in\r\nthe steaming Congo, in Haiti and in scattered and sundered islands in\r\nthe Pacific wastes.\r\n\r\nIn the misty ages, the formula for recovering or stimulating sexual\r\nvigor was comparatively simple. In Accadian and Chaldean, in Hittite and\r\nSumerian rituals there was the spell, the enchantment involving mystic\r\nterms, a sacred logos, a philtre of recognized potency, a particular\r\nherb or food enwrapped in entreaty and threats and injunctions to the\r\nimpalpable controlling forces and agencies.\r\n\r\nUnder the impact and influence of the esoteric science of the lands of\r\nAsia Minor and of Egypt, the prescriptions were extended, and assumed a\r\nvariety of forms and ultimately were collected and embodied in corpora\r\nof relevant matter, destined for consultation, for succeeding ages.\r\n\r\nMost of this matter, inscribed on papyrus, dates in the fourth century\r\nA.D., and is preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale, in Paris.\r\n\r\nA characteristic prescription gives directions for winning and ensuring\r\na girl’s love. Hecate is the motivating force: Hecate, the triple\r\ngoddess, the sorceress, equated with the moon-goddess Selene, with\r\nArtemis, and with Persephone, the goddess of the Underworld. The goddess\r\nHecate then is invoked with a plea: to ensnare the girl’s love by means\r\nof torture, so that she will ultimately succumb to the urgencies of the\r\npanting lover.\r\n\r\nOnce the ingredients are accumulated, the next step is for the pleading\r\nlover to extol the effectiveness of the recipe. In the ancient Greek\r\nmagic papyri, and in papyri containing particulars of love-charms, the\r\noffering itself is described in detail and its virtues are enumerated.\r\nScrupulous adherence to the method of administering or treating the\r\ncharm is enjoined. There is now the supplicative prayer to be intoned,\r\nwhile incense is sprinkled upon the sacrificial flames. Warnings are\r\nuttered, precautions are postulated, to prevent anything untoward from\r\naffecting the suppliant himself and bringing down upon his head any\r\nmalefic consequences. Directions are given for preparations of the\r\npotion. Prayers and chants to the goddess Actiophis follow. In her\r\nsemi-oriental designation the goddess is again invoked: Actiophis\r\nEreschigal Nebutosualethi Phorphorbasa Tragiammon. Emphasis is placed on\r\nwresting the girl into a state of unconditional passion.\r\n\r\nIn mythological contexts, certain divinities, such as Hecate, certain\r\nseers and warlocks, sorceresses and thaumaturgic adepts, are associated\r\nwith rejuvenative powers. The ancient witch Medea belongs in this\r\ncategory. She is foremost in her capacity for restoring masculine\r\nvirility and potency by means of her goetic techniques, her magical\r\ncharms, potions, and incantations.\r\n\r\nMedea, the cunning one, as her Greek designation indicates\r\netymologically, is the universal witch par excellence. She can renew the\r\nyouthful vigor of Aeson by boiling him in herbs endowed with special\r\nvirtues. Thus she is described by the Roman poet Ovid in Book 7 of the\r\n_Metamorphoses_. She can re-create Aegeus, the aged king of Athens, and\r\nbestow virility on him by virtue of her secret philtres. In _Medea_, the\r\ntragic drama of the Greek poet Euripides, she makes such an assertion\r\nand a promise:\r\n\r\n    Medea: I am undone, and more than that, am banished from the\r\n    land.\r\n\r\n    Aegeus: By whom? fresh woe this word of mine unfolds.\r\n\r\n    Medea: Creon drives me forth in exile from Corinth.\r\n\r\n    Aegeus: Doth Jason allow it? This too I blame him for.\r\n\r\n    Medea: Not in words, but he will not stand out against it. O, I\r\n    implore thee by this beard and by thy knees, in suppliant\r\n    posture, pity, O pity my sorrows; do not see me cast forth\r\n    forlorn, but receive me in thy country, to a seat within thy\r\n    halls. So may thy wish by heaven’s grace be crowned with a full\r\n    harvest of offspring, and may thy life close in happiness! Thou\r\n    knowest not the rare good luck thou findest here, for I will\r\n    make thy childlessness to cease and cause thee to beget fair\r\n    issue; so potent are the spells I know.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHedylus was a Greek epigrammatist of the third century B.C. In one of\r\nhis pieces a girl makes her confession that she was overcome and\r\nsuccumbed to wine and words of love. The wine, in fact, was the\r\noperative potion.\r\n\r\nAnother Greek epigrammatist, chanting of love and women, warns that\r\nman’s origin is lust itself.\r\n\r\nThe lyric poet Anacreon, who was born c. 570 B.C., suggests the\r\nattendant circumstances favorable to amatory exercise:\r\n\r\n              Sculptor, wouldst thou glad my soul,\r\n              Grave for me an ample bowl,\r\n              Worthy to shine in hall or bower,\r\n              When springtime brings the reveler’s hour.\r\n              Grave it with themes of chaste design,\r\n              Fit for a simple board like mine.\r\n              Display not there the barbarous rites\r\n              In which religious zeal delights;\r\n              Nor any tale of tragic fate\r\n              Which History shudders to relate.\r\n              No—cull thy fancies from above,\r\n              Themes of heaven and themes of love.\r\n              Let Bacchus, Jove’s ambrosial boy,\r\n              Distill the grape in drops of joy,\r\n              And while he smiles at every tear,\r\n              Let warm-eyed Venus, dancing near,\r\n              With spirits of the genial bed,\r\n              The dewy herbage deftly tread.\r\n              Let Love be there, without his arms,\r\n              In timid nakedness of charms;\r\n              And all the Graces, linked with Love,\r\n              Stray, laughing, through the shadowy grove;\r\n              While rosy boys, disporting round,\r\n              In circlets trip the velvet ground.\r\n              But ah! if there Apollo toys,\r\n              I tremble for the rosy boys.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the vast productions of the ancients, that included poetry and\r\nmemoirs, biographies and chronicles, essays and dialogues, there are\r\nanecdotes, references of various kinds, subtle hints and mere verbal\r\nreferences to domestic or social life, from which we may glean items\r\nthat are relevant to our present purpose.\r\n\r\nThis is the case with Plutarch, the Greek philosopher and biographer. He\r\nhad a long, productive span of life, extending from c. 46 A.D. to 120\r\nA.D. Primarily he is a biographer, and he is commonly so known. But he\r\nalso produced a series of literary, political, religious, and ethical\r\nstudies that are comprehensively included under the heading of\r\n_Moralia_.\r\n\r\nOne of these pieces consists of marriage precepts, Advice to Bride and\r\nBridegroom: Polianus and Eurydice. It is, as Plutarch himself states, a\r\ncompendium of marital conduct, and is packed with high ethical counsel,\r\nsober injunctions, sprinkled and reinforced with pertinent comments,\r\napothegms, and anecdotes. Yet the matter of amorous stimuli is\r\nconfronted straightforwardly and adroitly. The bride, Plutarch enjoins,\r\nshould, according to the wise old statesman Solon, nibble a quince\r\nbefore getting into bed. It was an old tradition that quince, and\r\nparticularly quince jelly, exercised erotic effects. Plutarch continues:\r\n\r\n    Fishing with poison is a quick way to catch fish and an easy\r\n    method of taking them, but it makes the fish inedible and bad.\r\n    In the same way women who artfully employ love-potions and magic\r\n    spells upon their husbands, and gain the mastery over them\r\n    through pleasure, find themselves consorts of dull-willed,\r\n    degenerate fools. The men bewitched by Circe were of no service\r\n    to her, nor did she make the least use of them after they had\r\n    been changed into swine and asses.\r\n\r\nEvidently the normal procedure in Plutarch’s day was to employ the\r\nlove-potion without hesitation. It must have been highly popular, a\r\nregular instrument of amorous stimulation. Further, in addition to\r\nsexual excitation, the potion manifestly induced other and less\r\nacceptable results, and it also intruded on normal physiological and\r\nemotional conditions. It was, in short, a malefic instrument. The most\r\nwholesome advice, then, that Plutarch could now offer was to shun such\r\nadventitious amatory aids, to rely primarily on the inherent amorousness\r\nof the two marrying partners.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn medieval Spain, in the thirteenth century, a certain Juan Ruiz,\r\nArchpriest of Hita, published a book entitled _Book of Good Love_. Good\r\nlove, that is, _buen amor_, is spiritual love, divine love. _Loco amor_\r\nis the frenzied, carnal love of women that St. Thomas Aquinas terms\r\n_amor naturalis_.\r\n\r\nRuiz, familiar with the concept and practices of both types of love,\r\nrefers to the large body of erotic stimulants, that the Arabs introduced\r\ninto Europe. Among such potions and aphrodisiacs were: citrus fruits,\r\nginger, cloves, cummin seeds, and carrots.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe actual composition of love-potions and analogous amatory fortifiers\r\nis not known in each case in specific detail. Erotologists, historians\r\nof ethnic mores, chroniclers, authors of amatory manuals, and writers on\r\nsimilar topics make frequent casual references to the fact of the potion\r\nitself, with the implication that the individual ingredients, their\r\nrelationship to each other, the sources of supply, and the method of\r\ncompounding them into one medicament are either so well established in\r\npublic knowledge as to dispense with the enumeration of the component\r\nelements, or are merely in the nature of traditional information,\r\ntransmitted to the reader without further comment, without the personal\r\nor necessary intrusion of the writer.\r\n\r\nDespite such strictures, however, there remains a sufficiently\r\nsubstantial corpus of knowledge relative both to the potion as such and\r\nto the elements of such a compound elixir.\r\n\r\nAn immediate, rational, and fundamental explanation of the dearth of\r\ndetails about the potion is that the draught had a high economic value.\r\nThe possessor of the mysterious ingredients collected and compounded and\r\ndistilled for monetary gain. The selling of potions was a lucrative\r\nbusiness: in the Middle Ages it was a flourishing industry, an\r\nindispensable production. And thus it was to the extreme advantage of\r\nthe dispenser of the amatory cup to guard and retain the secret recipes\r\nwith the most scrupulous care.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerfumes and spices and aromatic roots were often included in the\r\ncomposition of philtres, to give a particular fragrance to the unguent\r\nor medicament. This was usually the case among the Romans, who often, in\r\nlarge and luxurious families, had special laboratories where the\r\nessences were distilled. These essences contained, among other\r\ningredients, myrrh, cinnamon, marjoram, or spikenard.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome philtres consisted of testicular and related matter, as: the sperm\r\nof deer and other animals, and even menstrual blood. The belief was that\r\nan intimate causal relationship existed between the elements of the\r\nphiltre and the anticipated sexual implications.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the basic ingredients for a compound conducive to amatory vigor\r\nis mastic, recurrently recommended in the Arab manuals. Mastic is a gum\r\nor resin used nowadays in the manufacture of varnish. In some countries\r\nbordering the Mediterranean, particularly in Greece and Turkey, mastic\r\nis used to flavor a liquor.\r\n\r\nThe mastic shrub is an evergreen, multiple-branched, and indigenous to\r\nthe Greek island of Chios. In the Orient mastic has been used as a kind\r\nof chewing gum. The fruit itself is a red berry. This fruit, crushed and\r\npounded and mixed with honey, produces a drink that is reputed to be of\r\ngreat amatory potency.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGarlic, too, is an amatory stimulant, and has been so used in\r\ncomposition. It is repeatedly included in the enumeration of aphrodisiac\r\nelements, in both Western and Oriental erotic manuals. Among the\r\naboriginal Ainu of Northern Japan, garlic has the same gastronomic\r\nstatus as nectar and ambrosia, the food of the gods, among the ancient\r\nGreeks.\r\n\r\nSimilarly with syrup of vinegar, and nutmeg, with cardamom, which, in a\r\ncompound of onions, ginger, cinnamon and peas, is reputed to be\r\nparticularly efficacious in Arab countries. Peppers, both white and red\r\nvarieties, are credited with arousing intense sexual inclinations.\r\n\r\nIn the Arab manuals laurel-seeds are frequently mentioned: Indian\r\ncachou, cloves, gilly-flower. Instructions are given for pounding\r\nvarious items together into some consistency, then liquefying the\r\ncompound with a broth, or honey, or goat’s milk.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn all ages, alcohol has appealed to men for its aphrodisiac\r\npossibilities. In moderate amounts, it has been at various times and in\r\nvaried circumstances commended as a stimulant. In excessive doses,\r\nhowever, it appears to act as a decided anaphrodisiac.\r\n\r\nThe French King Louis XIV, whose reign was marked by the utmost sexual\r\nliberties, was accustomed to encourage his amatory inclinations with a\r\ndrink of alcohol sweetened with sugar.\r\n\r\nThroughout the European countries, there was a folk tradition that\r\nrequired a bride and a bridegroom to consume cakes steeped in alcohol\r\nand sugar, to ensure nuptial consummation.\r\n\r\nAccording to some authorities, small doses of spirits depress the higher\r\ncentres of the brain and thus release emotional inhibitions.\r\n\r\nBiblical literature is full of allusions to alcoholic drinks and\r\nspirits, and to their frequent use, but uniformly with the proviso of\r\ndue moderation.\r\n\r\nA relevant allusion occurs in Romans 14.21:\r\n\r\n    Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto\r\n    those that be of heavy hearts. Let him drink, and forget his\r\n    poverty, and remember his misery no more.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince fish contain phosphorus and other elements highly productive in\r\namatory inducements, brews and soups and chowders compounded of fish\r\nwill equally contribute to aid energizing vigor.\r\n\r\nCurries and sauces may act as excitants and hence be provocative, though\r\nby indirect means, of amatory urgencies.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe consumption of garlic, in any considerable quantity, may readily and\r\nnormally repel intimate contacts. But in antiquity, and through the\r\nmiddle centuries, it was widely in use as a pronounced aphrodisiac. This\r\nwas and still is especially so in the countries of the Mediterranean\r\nlittoral. In a fluid form, as distilled oil of garlic, it appears that\r\nit has its use also, but with less invigorating effect.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnise, which flourishes in the Eastern Mediterranean region, is used at\r\nthe present time for gastronomic purposes. But it was also reputed to\r\nincrease amatory excitation.\r\n\r\nIn the cyclic search for erotic reinforcements, the most horrific\r\ningredients and means have been utilized. Even the human body. One\r\nmedieval compound, for instance, consisted of the flesh of a human\r\ncorpse, in a putrefied condition, along with ovaries and testes, both\r\nhuman and animal, soaked in alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis de Sade, author of Justine, Les 120 Journées de Sodome, and\r\nother novels dealing with sexual orgies and perversions, presents a\r\ncharacter called Minski, a giant, who is himself anthropophagous and who\r\neulogizes the consumption of human flesh, dwelling with inhuman relish\r\non the texture, the taste, the continuous appeal of the human body in a\r\nsexual sense:\r\n\r\nMinski’s potency is such that, at the age of forty-five, his faculty for\r\nlubricity is able to induce in one evening ten manifestations. He admits\r\nthat this physiological energy is largely due to the quantity of human\r\nflesh that he consumes. He advises this same regimen to those who would\r\nlike to triple their capacity, apart from the strength and health and\r\nvigor that he will acquire through this diet. Once human flesh is\r\ntasted, one will disdain all other foods. No animal meat, no fish can\r\ncompare with human flesh. Once the initial repugnance is overcome, one\r\ncan never have enough of it.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat is the substance of Minski’s argumentation. In this century,\r\nWilliam Seabrook, the American writer who adventured in West Africa, the\r\nCaribbean Islands, and Arabia, himself describes the eating of human\r\nflesh in one of his personal narratives.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the medieval Italian physician Johannes Benedict\r\nSinibaldus, author of the Geneanthropoeia, a compound of dried black\r\nants was a frequent means of creating amatory desire. The ants were\r\nsoaked in oil and stored for use in a glass jar.\r\n\r\nIncense, particularly in the Orient, has immemorially been considered a\r\npriapic stimulant. In Biblical literature, in Exodus, the Lord gives\r\ndirections for the preparation of a sacred, divine incense. It is to be\r\ncomposed of onycha and galbanum, stacte, pure frankincense, and spices:\r\nthe whole to be reduced to a fine powder.\r\n\r\nThe most potent philtre or potion is the instinctive, natural,\r\nphysiological desire. This maxim has been postulated by many\r\nerotologists and sexologists. It is forcefully so asserted by Robert\r\nBurton, the seventeenth century encyclopedist who, while searching for a\r\nclue to the cure of melancholy, in his Anatomy of Melancholy,\r\nsimultaneously searched through all the chronicles, histories, and\r\ntreatises of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nPhiltres, he asserts, and charms, amulets and figurines, periapts and\r\nunguents are basically unlawful means: they are, actually, the last\r\nresort in the amatory quest. Panders and bawds and the attendants on\r\nerotic provocations give some meagre aid in this respect. Beyond that,\r\nthere is nothing but magic enchantments, Satanic assistance. ‘I know,’\r\nconfesses Burton, ‘that there be those that denye the devil can do any\r\nsuch things, and that there is no other fascination than that which\r\ncomes by the eyes.’ He then quotes from Pietro Aretino, the Italian\r\nerotic poet, in relation to Lucretia’s amatory power:\r\n\r\n            One accent from thy lips the blood more warmes,\r\n            Than all their philtres, exorcisms, and charms.\r\n\r\nLucretia’s erotic faculty was such that she could accomplish, merely by\r\nkissing and embracing, her sole philtre, as she admitted, more than all\r\nthe philosophers, astrologers, alchemists, necromancers, and witches.\r\n\r\nLucretia used neither potions nor herbs. With all my science, she said,\r\nI could never stir the hearts of men: only by my embraces, the warmth of\r\nmy lips. I forced men to rave like wild beasts, and countless among them\r\nI drove into bestial stupefaction, with the result that they adored me\r\nand my love like an idol.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the weird and confused history of human mores, there are noteworthy\r\nepisodes and anecdotes, some apocryphal and traditional, others\r\nwarranted by authenticity and verifiable historicity, relating to\r\namatory experiences and their effects. Many of such anecdotes, prevalent\r\nin Oriental and classical literature, describe the amazing consequences\r\nof the consumption of love-potions and similar concoctions.\r\n\r\nThere is the story of the wayward and untrustworthy but brilliant\r\nAlcibiades, the fifth century B.C. political leader in Greece. His\r\namorous bouts, his erotic intrigues, were so frequent, so forceful, and\r\nso indiscriminate that, as personal insignia, he bore the design of\r\nEros, the god of love and son of Aphrodite. Eros was, in this instance,\r\ndepicted as hurling lightning bolts. Of this same Alcibiades the tale\r\nran, according to a later chronicler, that as a young man Alcibiades had\r\nthe faculty of diverting wives from their husbands.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlcohol, like wine, in moderation, has regularly been used as an amatory\r\ncomplement. King Louis XIV of France, for instance, was accustomed to\r\ntake alcohol, with the addition of sugar, to arouse his jaded\r\nsensuality.\r\n\r\nBrides and bridegrooms, too, in medieval Europe, followed a folk custom\r\nof eating a cake dipped in alcohol and sugar.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe embattled women known anciently as Amazons, on taking prisoners in\r\nbattle, broke the captives’ arms or legs. The belief was that, by the\r\ndeprivation of a limb, the erotic functions of the captive would\r\ncorrespondingly be strengthened. One of the Amazon queens, Antiara by\r\nname, was the author of a kind of apothegm, that the lame best performed\r\nthe amatory act.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCertain foods have urgent amatory reactions. Brillat-Savarin, the arch\r\ngourmet who is the author of The Physiology of Taste, a standard\r\ngastronomic classic, relates that as a result of a repast that included\r\ntruffles and game, erotic manifestations among the guests were immediate\r\nand evident.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough the mandrake root involved amatory performances, it was often\r\nused for analgesic effects. Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, who ruled\r\nin the fifth century A.D., used to order mandrake to be inserted in\r\nwine, and the drink to be administered to victims doomed to crucifixion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn order to stimulate him doubly, both visually and fluidly, Anaxarchus\r\ndevised a suitable diversion. He was a fourth century B.C. Greek\r\nphilosopher, who was a friend of Alexander the Great, accompanying him\r\non his Eastern expeditions. At the usual Greek symposium, which included\r\ndrinking, entertainment, and discussion on various themes, Anaxarchus\r\nhad his wine poured out for him by a young and beautiful female\r\nattendant, in puris naturalibus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn classical antiquity, apples were associated with amatory\r\nconnotations. Apples were regularly exchanged as gifts among lovers.\r\nThis custom is mentioned by the Roman elegiac poet Catullus, and by\r\nVergil in the Eclogues: Galatea is after me with an apple. Again:\r\n\r\n                       I sent ten golden apples.\r\n\r\nPropertius, the elegiac poet, similarly writes:\r\n\r\n         I gave her apples stealthily in the palms of my hands.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the story of Ala-al Din abu-al, in the corpus of The Arabian Nights,\r\nthere is an incident that relates how a druggist prepared a love-potion.\r\nHe bought from a vendor of hashish two ounces of concentrated Roumi\r\nopium, and equal parts of cinnamon, Chinese cubebs, cardamoms, cloves,\r\nginger, and mountain shiek—which is a lizard with aphrodisiac\r\nproperties, and white pepper. After pounding these varied ingredients\r\ntogether, he boiled them in sweet olive oil, adding three ounces of male\r\nfrankincense and a cup of coriander seed. The mixture was then\r\nmacerated, and made into an electuary with bee-honey. The directions\r\ngiven by the druggist were as follows: After a dinner of house pigeon\r\nand mutton, well spiced, take a spoonful of this electuary, wash it down\r\nwith sherbet of rose conserve, and await results.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKing Henry IV of France, like other Gallic rulers, had pronounced erotic\r\ntendencies, resulting in the possession of many mistresses. On every\r\noccasion, before confronting one of them, he fortified his system with a\r\nglass of armagnac, a brandy distilled from wine.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn ancient Classical warning relating to the powerful dominance of love\r\nis contained in the tragic story of Arsinoe. Daughter of the King of\r\nCyprus, she rejected her lover Arceophon. In a fit of dejection, he\r\ncommitted suicide. But Arsinoe was punished for her disdain. She was\r\nturned into stone by Aphrodite herself.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCertain animals, in classical and Oriental mythology, were associated\r\nwith erotic symbolism. This was the case with the stag, the ass, the\r\nbull, the camel, the deer, the mare. During a festival in honor of\r\nDionysus, god of wine and in general of fertility, Priapus, the god who\r\nrepresented the active male principle, was on the point of exercising\r\nhis potency with the nymph Lotis. At the crucial moment, however, an ass\r\nbrayed, and saved Lotis. As a consequence, the ass was doomed to become\r\na sacrificial victim to Priapus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWomen were more rarely involved in experimenting with invigorating\r\nagents. One woman, however, has gained historical notoriety and infamy\r\nin this respect. She was the Countess Elizabeth Bathory, a seventeenth\r\ncentury Hungarian. In her passion for recovering her youthful energy,\r\nshe was said to have strangled some eighty peasant girls and to have\r\nbathed in their blood. Retribution overtook her in the act, and she was\r\nsentenced to imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFlagellation, as an erotic symbol, was known to the ancients and was\r\nfrequently practiced in the Middle Ages. Galen of Pergamum, the Greek\r\ngladiator-physician who flourished in the second century A.D. under the\r\nRoman Emperors, asserts that slave merchants used this practice in order\r\nto make their slaves more appealing to prospective buyers.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany historical personalities have been addicted to flagellation for\r\ntheir own purposes. Cornelius Gallus, administrator of the Roman\r\nprovince of Egypt and a friend of the Roman epic poet Vergil, resorted\r\nto scourging for the purpose of amatory excitation.\r\n\r\nOne Italian, a noted libertine of the times, had the scourge soaked in\r\nvinegar, to give the lashes greater pungency.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong probability that Abelard also used flagellation. For\r\nhe declares, addressing Héloise:\r\n\r\n    Verbera quandoque dabat amor non furor, gratia non ira, quae\r\n    omnium unguentorum suavitatem transcenderent. Again, he reminds\r\n    her of his own lascivious and libidinous ways: With threats and\r\n    scourges I often compelled thee who wast, by nature, a weaker\r\n    vessel, to comply, notwithstanding thy unwillingness and\r\n    remonstrances.\r\n\r\nTamerlane, the Asiatic master of the universe, the subject too of one of\r\nChristopher Marlowe’s tremendous dramas, was both a flagellant and a\r\nmonorchis.\r\n\r\nFinally, Jean Jacques Rousseau, in his Confessions, acknowledges his\r\ncondition:\r\n\r\n    I had discovered in pain, even in shame, a mixture of sensuality\r\n    that left me with a greater desire, rather than a fear, of\r\n    experiencing it again.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSexual license, although restrained among the Semites, among the Greeks\r\nand Romans under certain conditions, and among other ancient nations,\r\noften broke all bounds under particular circumstances, with resultant\r\norgies involving almost incredible erotic experiences. The Biblical\r\nepisode of the Golden Calf illustrates this situation, for it was an\r\nabsorption of pagan eroticism and then of pagan idolatry.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe wife of the Roman Emperor Antoninus Pius, Faustina, became enamoured\r\nof a gladiator. The Emperor consulted the court magicians, who\r\nsuggested, to diminish or eliminate her passion, that she be required to\r\ndrink the gladiator’s blood. They promised that, as a consequence,\r\nFaustina would conceive a lasting hatred for her erstwhile lover. She\r\ndrank the blood, and the magicians were justified in their prediction.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs an erotic performance, and, notably, as a means of curing sterility\r\nin women, certain practices associated with the phallic symbol were in\r\nforce in many countries, in all ages. The women of Brittany practiced\r\nphallic rites for centuries, in order to end their sterility. In one\r\ntown a public phallic figure was often the scene of a peculiar act. The\r\nwomen gathered some of the dust at the base of the image and swallowed\r\nit, anticipating, through this form of sympathetic symbolism, the\r\nfavorable outcome of the priapic implications.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was an old legend that King Philip of Macedon had been bewitched\r\nby a Thessalian maiden who had used philtres to effect her passionate\r\npurpose. When Olympias, the Queen, observed the girl’s beauty and\r\nbreeding and deportment, she declared that these qualities alone were\r\nthe philtres that had ensnared King Philip.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAntiquity consistently associated sexual performances with sacred and\r\ndivine rituals. So with the ancient Canaanites. The Hebraic tribes that\r\nlived in contiguous regions adopted this practice. They cohabited with\r\nthe women of Shittim, and associated with the daughters of Moab. They\r\nwent even further, and did obeisance to the gods of their neighbors,\r\nparticularly to the god Baal-peor. The full text of this episode appears\r\nin Numbers 25, verses 1–3.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was so much rivalry among the mistresses of King Louis XV of\r\nFrance that each one resorted to the most extreme means to hold his\r\naffection, or to regain his love. Madame de Pompadour, for example, used\r\na tincture of cantharides. Cantharides is the beetle Mylabris or Lytta\r\nVesicatoria. The active principle of this insect is a white powder\r\ncalled cantharidine: used as an amatory stimulant, but dangerous, and,\r\nwhen taken internally, fatal to the victim.\r\n\r\nFor Madame de Pompadour, however, and for many personalities notorious\r\nin history for their ruthless determination, there was the old but still\r\nmeaningful adage about fairness in war and in love.\r\n\r\nIt is a popular belief that castration eliminates all amatory\r\ninclination as well as capacity. The Greek author of the encyclopedic\r\nBanquet of the Philosophers, however, Athenaeus, states that the Medes\r\npracticed this operation with their neighbors, for the purpose of\r\narousing lustful excitations.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPearls, and other precious stones, were anciently credited with amatory\r\nproperties. In this connection, there was a legend that Cleopatra used\r\nto dissolve pearls in vinegar. She drank this mixture to excite her\r\nerotic sensualities.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVisual aphrodisiacs are virtually amatory philtres. The girls of ancient\r\nSparta wore a short knee-length garment that was slit high at the side.\r\nThe appellation given to these girls, thigh-showers, confirmed their\r\namorous allurement.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was an ancient Greek named Ctesippus, who had a notorious\r\nreputation for amorous exercises. He was so libidinous that, frantic in\r\nhis lustful urgencies, he sold the stones from his father’s grave to\r\npurchase the wherewithal for his pleasures.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApuleius, the Roman philosopher and novelist, author of the romantic\r\ntale entitled The Metamorphoses, who flourished in the second century\r\nA.D., was involved in a public trial. Accused of practicing witchcraft\r\nto win a widow’s love, he was also credited with preparing love-potions\r\nfor this purpose. The love-potions, it was charged, contained as\r\ningredients highly erotic elements: spiced oysters, sea hedge-hogs,\r\ncuttlefish, and lobsters. Apuleius, however, in a speech that is still\r\nextant, defended the innocuous nature of his offerings.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDancing among the Romans had erotic implications. According to the Roman\r\nhistorian Sallust, a certain Sempronia danced with more zest than a\r\nrespectable matron should.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDemocritus, the Greek philosopher who belongs in the fifth century B.C.,\r\nwas credited with the preparation of love philtres.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tyrant of Syracuse, in Sicily, Dionysius, who belongs in the fourth\r\ncentury B.C., was reputed to be an extreme libertine. He once filled a\r\nhouse with the fragrant herb thyme, which is an erotic stimulant, and\r\nwith roses in profusion. Then he invited the young women of the city to\r\nparticipate in an orgiastic sequence of libidinous performances.\r\n\r\nMadame du Barry, eager to retain the royal favor at the court of France,\r\noften prepared dishes that had amatory possibilities. These dishes\r\ninvolved: stewed capon, terrapin soup, crawfish, ginger omelettes,\r\nshrimp soup, and sweetbreads: all of which are reputed to be salacious\r\nprovocatives.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe goddess of the dawn, who in Greek mythology was Eos, rhododactylos,\r\nrosy-fingered, was a divinity endowed with such amorous intensity that,\r\nwhomever she observed favorably, she carried off for her amatory\r\npurposes. The youth Tithonus, who became her husband, was so treated. So\r\nwith Clitus, Orion, and Cephalus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were, in antiquity, lascivious dances that were sexually\r\nprovocative. One such dance was the Sicinnis, during which, in addition\r\nto lewd gestures, the clothes of the dancer were stripped off. Another\r\ndance was called the Dance of the Caleabides: also the Cordax, which\r\ninvolved amatory exhibitionism, denudation, and erotic motions.\r\n\r\nHerodotus, the first major Greek historian, relates an episode connected\r\nwith terpsichorean performances. Cleisthenes, ruler of Sicyon, had a\r\ndaughter named Agariste. Her beauty brought her numerous suitors, all\r\nunsuccessful, in turn. Finally a wealthy young Athenian, a certain\r\nHippoclides, appeared, as a guest at a banquet given by Cleisthenes.\r\nHaving imbibed too generously, Hippoclides mounted on a table, and\r\nperformed several lascivious dances. Cleisthenes was so shocked by the\r\nobscene movements that he declared to Hippoclides: You have danced away\r\nyour bride.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, was widely worshipped throughout\r\nthe Hellenic territories, both on the mainland of Greece, in Asia Minor,\r\nand in the Aegean Islands. At Paphos, in Cyprus, an annual festival,\r\nattended by both men and women, was held in her honor. The ceremonials\r\nconducted during the festival included frenzied sexual performances. In\r\ntoken of the goddess’ favor, each member left for Aphrodite a coin, in\r\nreturn for which they received a phallus and some salt.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPhallic figures were a common feature in ancient religious cults. But\r\neven as late as the eighteenth century the phallus appeared in public\r\ndemonstrations. At the annual three-day fair held in Isernia, in the\r\nKingdom of Naples, reproductions of a phallus were on sale. The\r\ncustomers were usually barren women, who, through this phallic\r\nsymbolism, anticipated a favorable outcome for their sterility.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn classical mythology, erotic inducements were used even by the\r\ndivinities themselves. In the Greek epic poem the Iliad, Hera, wife of\r\nthe supreme deity Zeus, employs such excitants, to arouse her husband.\r\nFrom Aphrodite, the goddess of love, Hera secures Aphrodite’s magic\r\ngirdle of love and longing ‘which subdues the hearts of all the gods and\r\nof mortal dwellers upon earth.’\r\n\r\nAphrodite ‘loosed from her bosom a broidered girdle, wherein are\r\nfashioned all manner of allurements; therein is love, therein is longing\r\nand dalliance—beguilement that steals the wits of the wise.’\r\n\r\nAnd, however wise he might be, Zeus’ wits were thus stolen.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough the search for amatory potency is one of the most dominant\r\nfactors in human history, there are cases where the opposite effect was\r\ndesired. A Roman matron, to cite one instance, named Numantina, wife of\r\nPlautius Sylvanus, was charged with having effected incapacity in her\r\nhusband by magic means.\r\n\r\nMagic played a part in medieval history too. Gregory of Tours, the sixth\r\ncentury A.D. churchman and historian, tells of a certain woman who was\r\nspell-bound by a number of concubines. She had become the wife of\r\nEulatius, and had thus inspired the concubines of this Eulatius into\r\njealous retaliation.\r\n\r\nAgain, according to the chronicles, the medieval king Theodoric was\r\nincapacitated by a magic spell.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the most lascivious women in all history was Catherine II of\r\nRussia. Married to the grandson of Peter the Great, and still childless,\r\nshe was informed by her advisers that an heir was urgent in order to\r\npreserve the Empire.\r\n\r\nCatherine consequently made a realistic decision. She ordered a\r\nsturgeon, and caviar, to be prepared for a banquet. Then she invited one\r\nof the officers of the Guard, named Sattikoff. The outcome of the\r\ninvitation, and of the piscatory repast, was an heir to the Russian\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Saladin is concerned in a story that is pointed in\r\nconfirmation of the amatory value of a fish diet. To verify the degree\r\nof continence of some holy dervishes, the Emperor invited two of them to\r\nan entertainment in his palace, at which rich food was served.\r\nOdalisques too took part in the banquet: but the dervishes succeeded in\r\nresisting the female blandishments. Saladin, however, dissatisfied with\r\nthis reaction of the dervishes, and rather astonished, ordered another\r\nrepast to be prepared. This consisted entirely of fish dishes. The\r\ndervishes were again invited, and the odalisques were present as\r\nentertainers. This time, Saladin was completely satisfied with his\r\npiscatory experiment, for the dervishes reacted to the odalisques as the\r\nEmperor had expected.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrancis I, King of France during the sixteenth century, was, apart from\r\nhis cultural interests, noted for his erotic experiences, that he\r\nextended by provocative foods, drinks, and concoctions of various kinds\r\ndesigned to prolong his capacity. His mistresses were innumerable, and\r\nhe died exhausted by his amatory excesses.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeorge IV, King of England, was a gourmet who appreciated the priapic\r\nproperties of truffles. His Ministers at the Courts of Naples, Florence,\r\nand Turin were given special and unusual directions. They were to\r\nforward to the Royal Kitchen in London any truffles that they discovered\r\nto be of superior quality in delicacy or flavor or size.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKing Edward VI of England was the victim, according to old historical\r\nchronicles, of bewitchment. The accused was the scholarly but tragic\r\nLady Jane Grey, who was charged with concocting magic potions and\r\nemploying amatory charms to the King’s detriment.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn ancient view on incapacity derives from Hippocrates. This famous\r\nGreek physician, who died in the same year as Socrates, in 399 B.C.,\r\nattributed the prevalence of genesiac incapacity among the Scythians to\r\nthe fact of their wearing breeches. He considered this sartorial custom\r\nas at least a predisposing cause: and modern views largely confirm his\r\npostulate.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGlorification of the sexual motif manifested itself on the island of\r\nCyprus, where the birth of Aphrodite was celebrated riotously. The\r\ndivine image was bathed in the sea by the women of the island: then\r\ndecked with garlands. There was a session of bathing in the river by\r\nboth sexes: but this performance was a mere preliminary to subsequent\r\norgiastic licentiousness.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBrasica eruca has long been considered a provocative agent. In a\r\nmedieval monastery it was grown in the garden, and used by the monks in\r\na daily infusion. The intention was to be roused from sluggish\r\ninactivity by this stimulating beverage. The concoction, however, had\r\nsuch physiological effects in an amatory sense that the monks climbed\r\nthe walls of the monastery and pursued their urgencies at the expense of\r\ntheir devotions. They transgressed both ‘their monastery walls and their\r\nvows,’ comments the medieval chronicle.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPassion knows no bounds, no formalities, no conventions. An anecdote\r\nrelated by the Greek philosopher and biographer Plutarch illustrates\r\nthis point. King Ptolemy II, who reigned in the third century B.C., was\r\nso enamoured of his mistress Belestiche that he built a temple in her\r\nhonor. Then he dedicated it and named his mistress Aphrodite Belestiche,\r\nimplicitly attributing to her divine characteristics.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMixoscopy is an erotic perversion that involves secret observation of\r\namatory performances.\r\n\r\nIn Homer’s Greek epic, the Odyssey, there is an instance of this\r\naberration, in the form of invited voyeurism. Hephaestus, the husband of\r\nAphrodite, goddess of love, surprised his wife in intimacy with Ares,\r\nthe war god. In revenge, he summoned all the deities to observe the\r\nsight of his wife in the amatory embrace of the god.\r\n\r\nAnother case of mixoscopy is related by Herodotus, the first major Greek\r\nhistorian. King Candaules, proud of his wife’s beauty, persuaded his\r\nfriend Gyges to hide in the sleeping chamber and observe the Queen while\r\nshe was preparing for bed. The Queen caught Gyges in the act of\r\nobservation and offered him this ultimatum: Either to kill the King and\r\nbecome her husband and the ruler of the Kingdom of Lydia: or to die on\r\nthe spot. Gyges accepted the first alternative, slew the King, married\r\nthe Queen, and became King of Lydia.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sacred nature of the phallus as a symbol was transmitted from\r\nantiquity into modern times. In the Kingdom of Naples, for instance, at\r\nTrani, a Carnival was held in which there was carried processionally a\r\nhuge figure of Priapus, ithyphallically posed, and termed by the\r\nparticipants in the celebration Il Santo Membro, The Holy Member. An\r\necclesiastical ordinance banished this pagan ceremony at the beginning\r\nof the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Greek mythology Orion, represented as a hunter or a monstrous giant,\r\nwas so lascivious that when Oenopion, King of Chios, was his guest, he\r\nravished the King’s daughter. Orion’s passion drove him to attack the\r\ngoddess Artemis, who punished him by sending a scorpion, that stung\r\nOrion to death. There are other versions of this myth, but basically\r\nthey represent the forcefulness and pervasiveness of the erotic motif in\r\nancient Greek life.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Richelieu, apart from his statesmanship, had other, more\r\nunique interests. One of these concerned amatory matters. He often\r\nentertained his guests and their mistresses at repasts called petits\r\nsoupers. These little suppers provided dishes so prepared as to be\r\nconducive to amatory intimacies. In addition, the guests all appeared at\r\nthe meals in puris naturalibus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOsphresiological conditions often have amatory reactions. Henry III of\r\nNavarre, for example, inspired Maria of Cleves with intense erotic\r\ninclinations on account of a perspiration-soaked handkerchief. Such was\r\nthe case also with Henry IV of France and Gabrielle.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century Katherine Craigie, a Scottish witch, prepared\r\nlove-potions for her clients. One such petitioner was a widow who had\r\nconceived a passion for a particular person. The witch promised her an\r\nherb that would make the man exclude all other interests, all other\r\nforms of affection, except love for the widow.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTitus Lucretius Carus, the first century B.C. Roman epic poet, author of\r\nthe remarkable De Rerum Natura, was, according to legend and to the\r\nstatement of St. Jerome, poisoned by a love philtre administered by\r\nLucretius’ own wife.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Roman Emperor Caligula, according to ancient chronicles, was given a\r\npotion by his wife Caesonia. Her object was to induce in the Emperor\r\namatory stimulation, but the drink threw him into a fit.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEven animals may be affected by amatory potions. There is an incident of\r\na drake that belonged to a chemist. In the chemist’s house there was\r\nsome water in a copper vessel that had contained phosphorus. Phosphorus\r\nhas aphrodisiac properties. When the drake drank the water, it was\r\naffected with amatory tendencies that manifested themselves until its\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Louis XIV of France approached old age and the disintegrating\r\nphysiological effects associated therewith, he still retained his\r\nlibidinous inclinations. As an invigorating drink, he was advised to\r\ntake a mixture of distilled spirits, orange water, and sugar.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lewd and perverted Roman Emperor Tiberius was so eager to experience\r\nall varieties of erotic possibilities that, when he became familiar with\r\nthe plant known as Sandix ceropolium, he exacted from his Germanic\r\nsubjects a tribute that was partly paid in the form of the plant.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Assyrian King Sardanapalus was known for his forthright,\r\nunrestrained mode of living. He perpetuated his memory in an inscription\r\non a stone statue of himself:\r\n\r\n           Sardanapalus, son of Anacyndaraxes, who conquered\r\n           Anchiale and Tarsus on a single day. Eat! Drink\r\n           Love! For all else is naught.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Hindu erotology, there are legends concerning magic devices for\r\novercoming sterility.\r\n\r\nKing Brihadratha, ruler of Magadha, was sensual and libidinous. But his\r\ngreat regret was the lack of an heir. He therefore consulted a holy\r\nascetic, a certain Candakaucika. The latter presented the king with a\r\njuicy mango that had just fallen from its tree. The mango was given to\r\nthe king’s two wives. Each wife gave birth to half a child. The two\r\nparts, being brought together, thus produced a complete heir.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Heliogabalus, according to the Historia Augusta, a Latin\r\ncollection of the biographies of thirty Roman emperors, was notorious\r\nfor his unsavory conduct: It was said that in one day he visited all the\r\nharlots in the circus, the theatre, the amphitheatre, and every spot in\r\nthe city. He would cover his head with a muleteer’s hood, in order to\r\navoid recognition. After bestowing on all the prostitutes pieces of\r\ngold, without consummating his lusts, he would add: Let nobody know that\r\nthe Emperor gave you this.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe association of an Emperor and a harlot is described in the Latin\r\ncollection of imperial biographies known as the Historia Augusta. The\r\nstory concerns the Emperor Verus, who reigned in the second century A.D.\r\nAt the instigation of a public harlot, he shaved off his beard while in\r\nSyria, an act that created much hostile talk in Syria itself.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the same Historia Augusta, the wild performances of the Emperor\r\nHeliogabalus are retailed:\r\n\r\nHe usually coaxed his friends into a state of drunkenness and suddenly\r\nat night let loose among them lions, leopards, and bears. When they woke\r\nup in the same chamber as the animals, and found lions, bears, and\r\nleopards around them, in the morning, or, what was worse, at night, they\r\ndied of fright.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor would buy up harlots from all the pimps and then set them\r\nfree. He gathered together all the prostitutes from the circus, the\r\ntheatre, the stadium, and from everywhere, and brought them into the\r\npublic buildings, and delivered military harangues, as it were, calling\r\nthem fellow-soldiers.\r\n\r\nAt similar gatherings he addressed ex-pimps that he assembled from every\r\nquarter, as well as the most depraved boys and youths. When he went to\r\nthe prostitutes, he dressed as a woman. At his banquets he and his\r\nfriends performed with women.\r\n\r\nThe story went that he bought a well-known and very beautiful harlot for\r\none hundred thousand sesterces.\r\n\r\n    In balneis semper cum muliebribus fuit, ita ut eas ipse\r\n    psilothro curaret: ipse quoque barbam psilothro adcurans:\r\n    quodque pudendum dictu est, eodem, quo mulieres adcurabantur, et\r\n    eadem hora, rasit et virilia subactoribus suis, novacula manu\r\n    sua, qua postea barbam fecit.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Historia Augusta makes many revelations about the intimate personal\r\nlife of the Roman Emperors and their erotic mores. Among the later\r\nrulers, Commodus, who belongs in the second century A.D., defiled the\r\ntemples of the gods with fornication and human blood.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the Emperor Severus, who flourished in the second century A.D., the\r\nHistoria Augusta says:\r\n\r\n    Domestically, he was indifferent, and kept his wife Julia,\r\n    although she was a notorious adulteress and an accomplice in the\r\n    conspiracy against his own life.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHeliogabalus, whose biography appears in the Historia Augusta and who\r\nruled in the third century A.D., discovered certain kinds of lustful\r\npleasures, as the chronicle states, to supersede the male prostitutes.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe younger Gordianus, the Roman Emperor who ruled in the third century\r\nA.D., was particularly fond of wine, and also of gastronomic delights.\r\nHe had a great attachment to women, and was said to have twenty-two\r\nconcubines assigned to him. He was called the Priam of his day, but the\r\npopular name for him was the Priapus of his times.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Roman general Lucullus, who belongs in the first century B.C., was\r\nalso a renowned gourmet, and held lavish and exotic banquets for his\r\nfriends. The Greek biographer and philosopher Plutarch, and the Roman\r\nhistorian Cornelius Nepos both relate that Lucullus consumed\r\nlove-potions, that made him unconscious.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe increase of libidinous inclinations, along with the physiological\r\nstimulus, was not invariably the sole, exclusive, and predictable effect\r\nof the love-potion. There were circumstances in which the potion might\r\nproduce, for instance, temporary conditions of insanity. Such was the\r\ncase, according to historical records, of the notable Roman\r\nadministrator Gallus, who belongs in the first century B.C. He was\r\ndriven mad through the excessive use of aphrodisiac philtres. Again,\r\nthere is a tradition that Titus Lucretius Carus, the Roman poet who\r\nproduced the remarkable epic entitled _The Nature of Things_, was the\r\noccasional victim of a potion administered by his wife with the\r\nintention of producing temporary insanity. So, too, with Lucullus, the\r\nRoman general and noted gourmet, who dates in the first century B.C. He\r\nsuccumbed to a poison that was contained as an ingredient in a love\r\nphiltre.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Orient, the almond becomes an amatory agent: either eaten whole,\r\nor ground into a powder, or mixed with other ingredients. Powdered\r\nalmonds with cream and egg yolks and chicken stock act presumably as a\r\nstimulant. So with honey taken with almonds and pine tree grains.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMinerals, precious stones have been constituents in exciting\r\npreparations. The medieval centuries in particular placed profound\r\ncredence in their virtues. The agate was thus reputed to promote\r\ngenesiac activity. So with molten gold taken in an infusion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll sorts of brews are known and experimented with in the East. A\r\nstimulant that, although credited with amatory effects, produced at the\r\nsame time violent reactions, was a Chinese concoction of opium and other\r\ningredients, called affion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHerbs were always a contribution in love drinks. An aromatic herb that\r\nwas called by the Romans Venus’ plant was known in the Middle Ages as\r\nSweet Flag and was considered an erotic excitation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnimal flesh and organs have immemorially formed part of the amatory\r\napparatus. In the second century A.D. a physician of Alexandria\r\nrecommended the flesh of lizard as a genesiac agent.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCheese and cherries, dried shrimp and scallops, fried spinach and\r\nnoodles: chestnuts boiled with pistachio nuts, pine kernels, sugar,\r\nrocket seed and cinnamon: chicken gizzard: a compound of juice of\r\npowdered onion and ghee, heated and then cooled and mixed with\r\nchick-peas and water: a cider drink: cinchona bark: a liqueur distilled\r\nfrom cinnamon: civet-perfumed candy: cod liver, and cod roe: cockles:\r\nall these disparate items, some centuries ago, others in our own\r\ncontemporary times, East and West, have been in use as generative\r\nprovocations: sometimes traditionally and hopefully: at other times,\r\nmerely traditionally.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Hindu manuals there are enumerated and described such varied\r\npotions and unguents and drugs that masculine activity, according to\r\nlegend, can be prolonged continuously to the extent of hundreds of\r\nindividual and successive occasions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the South Seas a stimulating drink, consumed after wedding ceremonies\r\nand other notable occasions, is made from the roots of the plant kava\r\npiperaceae. The root is chewed and then the juice extruded into a bowl:\r\nthe liquid is then strained and served.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Orient, from the bird known as King’s Crow, the extracted bile is\r\ncompounded into an amatory philtre.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA certain perfume popular among Arabs for amatory stimulus is known as\r\ndufz.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll sorts of drugs, both in their natural state and in synthetic\r\npreparations, dangerous in their application and fatal in their effects,\r\nhave frantically been enlisted as erotic attendants. The venereal\r\npassion has thus frequently transcended health, sanity, and the\r\ncontinuance of life itself. Among such drugs, draughts, and preparations\r\nare: damiana, absinthe, yohimbine, adrenaline, brucine, aphrodisin,\r\namanita muscaria, belladonna, borax, hashish, cocaine, bhang, mescaline,\r\nbufotenin, rauwiloid, harmine.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong gruesome items used for libidinous purposes was human dried liver.\r\nThe Romans were familiar with this ingredient, and Horace, the first\r\ncentury B.C. poet, makes mention of it in describing the dark operations\r\nof a witch.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFormerly used as a love charm was dragon’s blood: a red resin extracted\r\nfrom the fruit of a palm tree called botanically calamus draco. Cast\r\ninto a fire, dragon’s blood was believed, when accompanied by a binding\r\nspell in the form of a rhyming couplet, to induce an errant lover to\r\nreturn to the object of his passion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDog-stones, tubers of the orchis species, are shaped like the testiculi\r\ncanis, and hence are so called. At one time this plant was assumed to\r\nhave an amatory virtue.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the case of women, darnel grass was considered an amatory\r\nprovocation, when mixed with barley meal, myrrh, and frankincense.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe comparatively innocuous cucumber, used domestically in salads, has\r\nsometimes been credited, mainly for its phallic shape, with venereal\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Orient, the aromatic plant cumin, which is used as a condiment,\r\nis also considered aphrodisiacally. So with the pungent berry cubeb,\r\nnative to Java, and used in cooking and medicinally.\r\n\r\nIn the East, cubebs are chewed, sometimes powdered and mixed with honey:\r\nsometimes made into an infusion with cubeb leaves. The provocative\r\nvirtues of cubeb peppers are widely known and esteemed, from Arabia to\r\nChina, and have been used erotically since at least the thirteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPeriapts and amulets of various types, both inanimate and organic, have\r\nbeen used with amatory prospects. Thus, in the Orient, betel nuts were\r\nso used. Or a lock of woman’s hair, over which a spell had been uttered.\r\nOr the human liver, as in ancient Greece, was considered the source of\r\nall desire and hence became a fetish. Or, in the East, a hyena’s udder,\r\ntied on the left arm, would induce the longed-for passion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe aromatic plant basil, used as a condiment, was also credited with\r\nexciting reactions. So much so, in fact, that in Italy the herb was used\r\nby maidens as a love charm.\r\n\r\nBeans, too, were thought at all times to be highly amatory in their\r\nresults. Hence the Church Father St. Jerome forbade the use of beans to\r\nnuns.\r\n\r\nCarrots, turnips, wild cabbage, and beets have also been included at\r\nvarious times in this category. Pliny the Elder, the Roman author of the\r\nHistoria Naturalis, states that white beets are an amatory aid.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a long accepted tradition in the efficacy of certain fish,\r\nespecially the barbel, which is mentioned by the Roman poet Ausonius in\r\na poem dealing with various species of fish.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fat of a camel’s hump, melted down, and also camel’s milk taken with\r\nhoney are, in Oriental erotological literature, considered of marked\r\nvenereal value.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe brains of certain animals were at various periods considered, apart\r\nfrom their food value, to possess erotic effects. So with the brains of\r\nsheep, pig, and calf. In some countries, notably in the Mediterranean\r\narea, animal brains are prepared as a gastronomic delicacy.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt one time the milk of a chameleon was treated as a generative\r\nexcitation. The thirteenth century Arab physician and philosopher\r\nAvicenna so recommended it.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRhubarb and cinnamon, ginger and vanilla, mixed in wine, produce a\r\nrecipe that was prevalent in Italy, So with curaçao, mixed with madeira\r\nwine: to which were added pieces of sugar.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn old collection of unique recipes, entitled the Golden Cabinet of\r\nSecrets, was formerly but incorrectly included among the works of the\r\nGreek philosopher Aristotle. The collection itself was long popular for\r\nits putative authority. An amatory powder, described in the Cabinet, is\r\ncompounded thus: Flowers of seeds of elecampane, vervain, mistletoe\r\nberries are crushed together and dried thoroughly in an oven. The powder\r\nis taken in a glass of wine, and the effects, it was urged, would be\r\nmost gratifying.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUsually, amatory concoctions were prepared individually, for each\r\nsuppliant. In the seventeenth century, however, an Englishman by the\r\nname of Burton, an apothecary, established a factory in the town of\r\nColchester. Here he produced on a large scale aphrodisiacs compounded of\r\nthe roots of sea holly.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were for sale, in Rome, in the market place, in booths and\r\nemporia, and in quarters where people of all ranks and all ethnic\r\norigins congregated, philtres and brews, and articles putatively endowed\r\nwith provocative and generative properties. Dried human marrow, and the\r\nsucking-fish, star-fish and intimate genital secretions, both male and\r\nfemale, were used in these concoctions. And over the preparations arose\r\nsupplications and invocations and incantations directed to the\r\ndivinities of the underworld, entreating efficacy in the purchased\r\npotions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong plants that have both culinary uses and at least presumed amatory\r\nimplications are the artichoke and asparagus. In France, artichokes were\r\nsold by vendors who, in their street cries, added forthrightly that\r\nartichokes aroused the genital areas.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the Orient, asparagus, fried with egg yolks, and sprinkled\r\nwith spices, constituted a decidedly amatory dish.\r\n\r\nThe egg plant, too, split and boiled with a flour paste, vanilla beans,\r\npimentos, chives, and pepper-corns, and a concoction known as bois bandé\r\nor tightening wood, containing strychnine and hence highly dangerous,\r\nwas commonly in use in the West Indies, where it was credited with\r\nexcitant qualities.\r\n\r\nIn China, again, bamboo shoots, usually an appetizing culinary\r\ningredient, are believed to have an aphrodisiac value.\r\n\r\nA shrub that, since Roman times, was used for inciting desire was\r\nbirthwort. In this respect it was quite familiar to the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nBitter sweet, too, like many herbs, was at one time credited with erotic\r\nvirtues.\r\n\r\nThe berry of the caper plant, that is, caperberry, belongs in the same\r\ncategory. Its potency was reputedly so great that the plant is equated,\r\nin Ecclesiastes, with erotic desire itself.\r\n\r\nPaprika, which is Hungarian red pepper, is prepared from the plant\r\ncapsicum annuum, and is both a spice and a traditionally credited\r\namatory aid.\r\n\r\nA plant similar to the artichoke, and equally prickly, is cardoon,\r\nconsidered a stimulating agent. In France, the fleshy parts of the inner\r\nleaves are consumed with this intent.\r\n\r\nCaraway seeds, in the East, are valued erotically.\r\n\r\nStewed in milk sauce, carrots are endowed, in Oriental manuals, with\r\nstimulating characteristics. In ancient Greece the carrot, used as a\r\nvenereal medicine, was called a philtron.\r\n\r\nRosemary, the aromatic shrub, has leaves that are used in perfumery,\r\nmedicinally, and in cookery. Among the Romans, it has an amatory virtue.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome amatory doses are of such a nature that excess may prove fatal. An\r\nurgent young man, invited to a dinner prepared by a courtesan, ate too\r\nheartily. He died on the following day, as all the dishes had been\r\nspiced with a potent stimulus.\r\n\r\nFerdinand of Castile, too, died from an administration of the same drug\r\nthat had spiced the courses at the banquet.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA medieval powder that was an energizing potential, rejuvenating and\r\nrefreshing, is described by the English dramatist Ben Jonson (c.\r\n1573–1637) in his comedy Volpone. Volpone himself offers the beautifying\r\npowder thus:\r\n\r\n    Here is a powder concealed in this paper, of which, if I should\r\n    speak to the worth, nine thousand volumes were but as one page,\r\n    that page as a line, that line as a word; so short is this\r\n    pilgrimage of man (which some call life) to the expressing of\r\n    it. Would I reflect on the price? Why, the whole world is but as\r\n    an empire, that empire as a province, that province as a bank,\r\n    that bank as a private purse to the purchase of it. I will only\r\n    tell you; it is the powder that made Venus a goddess (given her\r\n    by Apollo), that kept her perpetually young, cleared her\r\n    wrinkles, firmed her gums, filled her skin, colored her hair;\r\n    from her derived to Helen, and at the sack of Troy unfortunately\r\n    lost, till now, in this our age, it was as happily recovered, by\r\n    a studious antiquary, out of some ruins of Asia, who sent a\r\n    moiety of it to the court of France (but much sophisticated),\r\n    wherewith the ladies there, now, color their hair.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe innocuous cress, that is regularly used in salads, was formerly\r\nconsumed, either raw or boiled or as a juice, for its invigorating\r\nvalue. Cress was prescribed, in Roman times, in recipes intended to cure\r\nincapacity. In the Orient, this property of cress as an aphrodisiac is\r\nstressed in the erotic manuals.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong many other herbs and plants that induce amatory conditions are\r\nvalerian and coriander and violet: these are mentioned in this respect\r\nby Albertus Magnus, the medieval philosopher.\r\n\r\nAnother plant, botanically known as melampryum pratense and commonly\r\ncalled cow wheat, was given as fodder to cows. But it had also a\r\nreputation, according to Pliny the Elder and the Greek physician\r\nDioscorides, as a rousing stimulus of passion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe dried seeds of the Cola Nitida, a nut indigenous to Africa,\r\nfurnishes a drink called cola. This beverage is also known as bichy. The\r\ncola nut itself, which is chewed, is credited, among the Africans, with\r\npromoting vigor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA brew compounded of the Indian root called galanga, and cardamoms,\r\nlaurel seeds, sparrow wort, nutmeg, cubebs, cloves, in a fowl or pigeon\r\nbroth, was held to be a powerful stimulant, especially among Arabs.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWomen esteemed, as an amatory incitement, the brains of the mustela\r\npiscis.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo a plant with a root shaped like a claw, called lycopodium, was\r\nformerly attributed the quality of inducing desire.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Eastern countries, the fruit of the mastic-tree, pounded with oil and\r\nhoney, makes a drink that is highly esteemed among Arabs as a venereal\r\nprovocation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Arab erotologist Umar ibn Muhammed al-Nefzawi, author of _The\r\nPerfumed Garden_, a survey in amatory practices, discusses the entire\r\nrange of erotic experiences and procedures among men and women. He\r\ntreats of genital conditions, medical problems, potions, sexual\r\nceremonials, circumstances favorable to amatory consummations,\r\nmanipulations and contrivances and preparations that affect amatory\r\npotentialities. With all this mass of detail and particularization of\r\nvenereal topics, the author emphasizes that his work is not an\r\nexposition directed toward lewd and libidinous ends, but a virtual\r\nglorification of the gifts bestowed upon men by divine graciousness and\r\nindulgent beneficence.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPlutarch, the Greek historian and philosopher, in his _De Sanitate\r\nTuenda Praecepta_, Advice on Keeping Well, tells of an amatory incident:\r\n\r\n    When the young men described by Menander were, as they were\r\n    drinking, insidiously beset by the pimp, who introduced some\r\n    handsome and high-priced concubines, each one of them (as he\r\n    says),\r\n\r\n    Bent down his head and munched his own dessert, being on his\r\n    guard and afraid to look at them.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe inventive genius of man has included in the preparation of love\r\nphiltres the most heterogeneous items, such as: human fingers, hoopee\r\nbrains, tobacco, human excrement, snake bones, toads, skulls and\r\nintestinal fluids and organs. Horace and Catullus, Pliny the Elder and\r\nApuleius, among the Romans, have frequent occasion to refer to philtres\r\nand their ingredients and effects.\r\n\r\nSo too the medieval and later physicians and demonographers have much to\r\nsay on the subject: Martin Delrio and Sprenger, Reginald Scott and\r\nBodin, Johannes Muller and Sinibaldus. A Roman recipe, composed by a\r\nwitch, runs as follows:\r\n\r\n                 Bring the eggs and plumage foul\r\n                 Of a midnight shrieking owl,\r\n                 Be they well besmear’d with blood\r\n                 Of the blackest venom’d toad,\r\n                 Bring the choicest drugs of Spain,\r\n                 Produce of the poisonous plain,\r\n                 Then into the charm be thrown,\r\n                 Snatch’d from famish’d bitch, a bone,\r\n                 Burn them all with magic flame,\r\n                 Kindled first by Colchian dame.\r\n\r\nJohn Gay, the eighteenth century playwright, in _The Shepherd’s Week_,\r\nhas one of the characters refer to a philtre in a casual and incidental\r\nmanner, implying that the practice of this usage was in common vogue:\r\n\r\n            And in love powder all my money spent;\r\n            Behap what will, next Sunday after prayers,\r\n            When to the ale house Lupperkin repairs,\r\n            These golden flies into his mug I’ll throw,\r\n            And soon the swain with fervent love shall glow.\r\n\r\nShakespeare, too, in _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_, alludes to the love\r\nphiltre:\r\n\r\n           Yet mark’d I where the bolt of Cupid fell,\r\n           It fell upon a little western flower,\r\n           Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound,\r\n           And maidens call it Love-in-Idleness.\r\n           Fetch me that flower; the herb I show’d thee once,\r\n           The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid\r\n           Will make or man or woman madly dote\r\n           Upon the next live creature that it sees.\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n               I’ll watch Titania when she is asleep,\r\n               And drop the liquor of it in her eyes,\r\n               The next thing then she waking looks upon,\r\n               Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,\r\n               On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,\r\n               She shall pursue it with the soul of love.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerfumes of all kinds, used on the person, on the genitalia, on clothes,\r\nin beds, in foods, were considered arousing stimulants. This procedure\r\nwas in vogue both among the ancient Greeks and Romans, in the Orient,\r\nand during the Middle Ages: and is, of course, far from obsolescent\r\nthese days.\r\n\r\nThe Greek playwright Aristophanes mentions perfumes in his comedy\r\n_Lysistrata_ in connection with sexual enticements. Horace the Roman\r\nlyric poet tells of an old lecher ‘scented with nard.’\r\n\r\nAmbergris and civet were immensely popular. An ointment, extracted from\r\nspikenard, was known as foliatum: another, as nicerotiana. Cinnamon,\r\nsweet marjoram, myrrh, were in use. So with aromatic oils. Perfumes, in\r\nfact, are regularly mentioned in erotic and sexual situations and\r\ncontexts. The corpus of the _Arabian Nights_ contains many episodes\r\ninvolving the use and impact of scents. The Biblical _Song of Songs_ too\r\nmakes apposite reference to the subject:\r\n\r\n            a bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me ...\r\n            ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart ...\r\n            perfumes and sweet spices ...\r\n            beds of aromatic spices ...\r\n\r\nBen Jonson, the English dramatist, has Volpone, in the comedy of that\r\nname, offer Celia perfumed baths:\r\n\r\n             The milk of unicorns, and panthers’ breath\r\n             Gathered in bags, and mixed with Cretan wines.\r\n             Our drink shall be prepared gold and amber.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnions in particular have for centuries possessed an aphrodisiac\r\nreputation. Onion is recommended for such intentions by the Greek and\r\nRoman poets. Ovid and Martial, and the later bucolic poet Columella\r\nurgently stress the eating of plenty of onions as both a rejuvenating\r\nand an animating agent. The Greek physician Galen also considered onions\r\nas having stimulating virtues.\r\n\r\nIn the East, onion seed is pounded, mixed with honey, and taken while\r\none is fasting, in the hope of physiological urgency.\r\n\r\nAmong Arabs, onions boiled with spices, then fried in oil with egg\r\nyolks, are, if taken successively on a number of days, considered of\r\nhigh potency.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe seat of amorous passion was traditionally the liver. This concept is\r\nexemplified in _The Faithful Shepherdess_, by John Fletcher:\r\n\r\n        Amoret: Dear friend, you must not blame me, if I make\r\n          A doubt of what the silent night may do,\r\n          Coupled with this day’s heat, to move your blood.\r\n          Maids must be fearful. Sure you have not been\r\n          Wash’d white enough, for yet I see a stain\r\n          Stick in your liver: go and purge again.\r\n\r\n        Perigot: Oh, do not wrong my honest simple truth!\r\n          Myself and my affections are as pure\r\n          As those chaste flames that burn before the shrine\r\n          Of the great Dian; only my intent\r\n          To drag you thither was to plight our troths,\r\n          With interchange of mutual chaste embraces,\r\n          And ceremonious tying of our souls.\r\n          For to that holy wood is consecrate\r\n          A virtuous well, about whose flowery banks\r\n          The nimble-footed fairies dance their rounds\r\n          By the pale moonshine, dipping oftentimes\r\n          Their stolen children, so to make them free\r\n          From dying flesh and dull mortality.\r\n          By this fair fount hath many a shepherd sworn,\r\n          And given away his freedom, many a troth\r\n          Been plight, which neither envy nor old time\r\n          Could ever break, with many a chaste kiss given\r\n          In hope of coming happiness; by this\r\n          Fresh fountain many a blushing maid\r\n          Hath crown’d the head of her long-loved shepherd\r\n          With gaudy flowers, whilst he happy sung\r\n          Lays of his love and dear captivity.\r\n          There grow all herbs fit to cool looser flames\r\n          Our sensual parts provoke, chiding our bloods,\r\n          And quenching by their power those hidden sparks\r\n          That else would break out, and provoke our sense\r\n          To open fires; so virtuous is that place.\r\n          Then, gentle shepherdess, believe and grant.\r\n          In troth, it fits not with that face to scant\r\n          Your faithful shepherd of those chaste desires\r\n          He ever aim’d at, and ...\r\n\r\n        Amoret: Thou hast prevail’d; farewell. This coming night\r\n          Shall crown thy chaste hopes with long-wish’d delight.\r\n\r\n        Perigot: Our great god Pan reward thee for that good\r\n          Thou hast given thy poor shepherd!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA medieval song, that appears in _The Maid’s Tragedy_, by Beaumont and\r\nFletcher, suggests that restraint in lust may occasionally be a\r\ndesideratum:\r\n\r\n           I could never have the power\r\n           To love one above an hour,\r\n           But my heart would prompt mine eye\r\n           On some other man to fly.\r\n           Venus, fix mine eyes fast,\r\n           Or, if not, give me all that I shall see at last!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn _Philaster_, a play by Beaumont and Fletcher, mention is made of an\r\namatory provocative that was in common use in the Middle Ages and later:\r\n\r\n    Cleremont: Sure this lady has a good turn done her against her\r\n    will; before she was common talk, now none dare say cantharides\r\n    can stir her. Her face looks like a warrant, willing and\r\n    commanding all tongues, as they will answer it, to be tied up\r\n    and bolted when this lady means to let herself loose. As I live,\r\n    she has got her a goodly protection and a gracious; and may use\r\n    her body discreetly for her health’s sake, once a week,\r\n    excepting Lent and dog-days. Oh, if they were to be got for\r\n    money, what a great sum would come out of the city for these\r\n    licenses!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFoods and herbs that have a gastronomic appeal are often empirically\r\ncredited with amatory traits as well. For instance, eel soup and\r\npreserves and sundry pies have been brought into the field of such\r\nbeneficial stimulants. Also the herb eryngium maritimum or Sea Holly,\r\nwhose fleshy roots were candied and served hot in Elizabethan and later\r\ndays. Figs and fennel soup: tunny fish and plovers’ eggs, halibut,\r\nplaice, mackerel and mullet. So with apples and potatoes and garlic.\r\nHorseradish and sesame seeds, vanilla and turmeric, frangipane cream and\r\npurslane: frogs’ legs and peaches. Ghee, ginger-fruit jam. Goose-tongues\r\nand grapes and guinea fowl. Hare soup and haricot beans. Soup seasoned\r\nwith thyme, pimento, cloves, and laurel. Lentils and pomegranates and\r\ndates. Mutton, lamb, and rice. Mallows boiled in goat milk. Or the sap\r\nof mallows. Aromatic marjoram and marrow. Mint and onions, pineapple and\r\nmushrooms. Peas, and pastries kneaded into phallic and genital forms.\r\nAll things, it appears, that are edible or potable come at some time or\r\nother under the classification of anticipatory amatory aids.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMessalina, the wife of the Roman Emperor Claudius, was infamous for her\r\nlicentiousness, her intrigues, and her obscene amours. Historical\r\ntestimony relates that she had amorous encounters with fourteen\r\nathletes, and in consequence assumed the honorific of _Invincible_. In\r\ncommemoration of the episode she also dedicated fourteen wreaths to the\r\nPriapic god.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApuleius, the Roman novelist who flourished in the second century A.D.,\r\nalludes to an ancient Roman list of ingredients in the preparation of\r\nlove-potions:\r\n\r\n                   They dig out all kinds of philtres\r\n                   from everywhere:\r\n                   they search for the agent that\r\n                   arouses mutual love:\r\n                   pills and nails and threads,\r\n                   roots and herbs and shoots,\r\n                   the two-tailed lizard,\r\n                   and charms from mares.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA certain philtre, according to the testimony of Girolamo Folengo in his\r\n_Maccaronea_, published in 1519, was composed of black dust from a tomb,\r\nthe venom of a toad, the flesh of a brigand, the lung of an ass, the\r\nblood of a blind infant, the bile of an ox, and corpses rifled from\r\ngraves.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is unusual to discover a decided anti-aphrodisiac, recommended as an\r\nantidote, for banishing lust. The following prescription appears in the\r\n_Secrets of Albertus Magnus_, a medieval magic manual:\r\n\r\n    Turtur, a Turtle, is a birde very well knowne. It is called\r\n    Merlon of the Chaldees, of the Greeks Pilax. If the heart of\r\n    this foule be borne in a Wolves skin, he that weareth it shall\r\n    never have an appetite to commit lechery from henceforth.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the same magic manual attributed to Albertus Magnus the medieval\r\nphilosopher, there is a description of a philtre that has a number of\r\nproperties, both medicinal and amatory:\r\n\r\n    The seventh is the herb of the planet Venus, and is called\r\n    Pisterion, of some Hierobotane, id est, Sterbo columbaria et\r\n    Verbena, Vervin.\r\n\r\n    The root of this herb put upon the neck healeth the swine\r\n    pockes, apostumus behinde the eares, and botches of the neck,\r\n    and such as cannot keepe their water. It healeth cuts also, and\r\n    swelling of the evil, or fundament, proceeding of an\r\n    inflammation which groweth in the fundament.\r\n\r\n    It is also of great strength in veneriall pastimes. If any man\r\n    put it into his house or vineyard, or in the ground, he shal\r\n    have great store of increase.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother love charm, from Albertus Magnus’ _Book of the Marvels of the\r\nWorld_, is designed to stabilize a woman’s affection:\r\n\r\n    If thou wilt that a woman bee not visious nor desire men, take\r\n    the private members of a Woolfe, and the haires which doe grow\r\n    on the cheekes or eyebrowes of him, and the haires which bee\r\n    under his beard, and burne it all, and give it to her to drinke,\r\n    when she knoweth not, and she shal desire no other man.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMacrobius, a Roman writer who flourished c. 400 A.D., is the author of a\r\nsymposium entitled _Saturnalia_, in which he states that hot drinks,\r\nparticularly wine, are provocative of amatory exercise: deinde omnia\r\ncalida Venerem provocant et semen excitant et generationi favent. Hausto\r\nautem mero plurimo fiunt viri ad coitum pigriores. That is, a long\r\ndraught of unmixed wine is a decided stimulant to genesiac activity. On\r\nthe other hand, like many of the ancient erotic poets, Macrobius adds\r\nthat excessive and cold wine is a deterrent: vini nimietas ut frigidi\r\nfacit semen exile vel debile.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe plant verbena officinalis was known to Hippocrates and later on to\r\nPliny the Elder as an effective means of inducing virile potency.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn Indian plant named Datroa, the juice of which was used in a drink,\r\nwas given as a physiological stimulant\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century an erotic concoction known as Diavolini was\r\npopular in Italy. In France, these Diavolini became equally popular\r\nunder the name of diablotins—devil-pastilles.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe nettle, urtica urens, was a legendary and traditional stimulus,\r\ncredited with promoting decisive potency.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOcimum Basilicum is a plant with labiate flowers. It was known to the\r\nEgyptians and is mentioned by the Roman encyclopedist Pliny the Elder.\r\nIt was used as an aphrodisiac as well as for other medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLycopodium Clavatum, a plant known by a variety of other names, was\r\nformerly used in amatory practices.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe amethyst was anciently considered a stone whose contact was a\r\nstimulus to passion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages there was in Germany a kind of humorous folk legend\r\nthat was called the Old Wives’ Mill. This legend extended into the\r\neighteenth century. The theme was the rejuvenation of old women into\r\nyoung maidens and young women. There is an old print depicting the Mill,\r\nwith elderly females being carried into the Mill and coming out young\r\nand comely.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe means of arousing erotic sensations and the devices contrived for\r\nthe furtherance of weird or furtive amatory conditions have varied all\r\nthe way from forthright bestialities, sacrificial blood rituals, as\r\ndescribed by the poet Horace with reference to the witch Canidia’s\r\npractices, down to more or less innocuous or ineffectual concoctions.\r\n\r\nAs far as ritual killing is concerned, and the extraction of human\r\norgans for amatory purposes, such methods were in vogue in Europe until\r\nfar into the seventeenth century, notably in France.\r\n\r\nA French preparation, that promised a renewal of physiological vigor,\r\nwas known as Essence à l’usage des monstres.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCertain ancient Greek papyri contain suggestions and recipes intended to\r\npromote physiological vigor and by means of magic formulas to correct\r\namatory deficiencies. These papyri now belong in the Louvre, in Paris,\r\nand in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nDiagrams and symbols appear in the papyri. There are invocations, magic\r\nritualistic prescriptions. There are, also, invocations and\r\nsupplications to strange deities: among them, Sabazios, a\r\nThracian-Phrygian god who had affinities with Dionysus, the god of wine,\r\nof fertility, and of procreation. He was also equated with the deity\r\ncalled Curios Sabaoth, mentioned in the Septuagint, and also Theos\r\nHypsistos.\r\n\r\nThe Greek writer Lucian’s _Lover of Lies_ consists of a collection of\r\nsketches on various contemporary superstitions and practices. There are\r\ndescriptions of magic statues endowed with animation, awesome\r\napparitions, and also charms for bringing back a lover who has strayed.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe River Scamander, in Greece, was reputed to be such a potent amatory\r\nstimulus that maidens hopefully bathed in its waters. On one occasion,\r\naccording to the testimony of the orator Aeschines, the beautiful\r\nCallirhoë, on her way to bathing in the sacred Scamander, was met by a\r\nyoung man who represented himself as an aide to the river god. The young\r\nman then substituted himself for the god and performed his divine\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe medieval demonographer Martin Delrio, in his Disquisitionum\r\nMagicarum Libri Sex, discusses love charms, brews of all kinds, and\r\nother amatory inducements used by practitioners in the Black Arts. He\r\nmentions formulas and incantations, spells and alluring chants such as\r\nthe seductive croonings of the ancient sirens, as well as the hypnotic\r\nmusic produced by Orpheus: also concoctions compounded of viscera and\r\nblood and other more intimate secretions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmatory inducements may be merely sensuous, or bodily proximity, as in\r\ndancing. Or excitation may be provoked by listening to an appealing\r\nvoice, or visually observing a theatrical spectacle. Or recalling a\r\nfragment of song, a forgotten melody.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nParticularly in the Orient, amatory preparations often run the gamut\r\nfrom oddities or puerilities to items that are monstrous in themselves,\r\nor so rare as to preclude the possibility of securing them: as, the\r\nscale of a tortoise, or the secretions of a stag, or a corpse, or a\r\nhyena’s brains or whiskers.\r\n\r\nYet, in the East, these ingredients might well be furtively whispered to\r\nthe love-sick suppliant by some aged crone who is the repository of\r\nlegendary remedies, or by an obscure apothecary, whose pharmacopoeia is\r\nmedieval, or by some wandering minstrel or trader.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCertain plants are associated with erotic consequences and have been\r\nresorted to by those in restless quest of amatory contentments. Among\r\nthese plants are: the root of narcissus, vervain, water lilies, and\r\nbamboo.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn one Hindu erotic manual, a kind of Rake’s Progress entitled The\r\nHarlot’s Guide, certain ingredients are enumerated as contributing to\r\nthe potency of philtres. Included in the items are fish soup, ghee, and\r\nindigenous herbs.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn former times, in France, a dish of the testes of a kid or a bull or a\r\nfox or a hare would be set before a man who intended to embark on\r\namatory ventures.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLove stimulants may be both material and psychic. They may have\r\nphysiological impacts that result in amatory capacity, or they may\r\nheighten and arouse the emotional awareness and sensitivity, with\r\nsimilar results.\r\n\r\nAmong the medieval investigators, philosophers, and alchemists and\r\noccultists, Albertus Magnus held a dominant position. He had a\r\nperception of scientific method, yet he also dealt in unwarranted and\r\nlegendary fantasies. He wrote on physiology and astronomy. He\r\ninvestigated plant and animal life. He equated the characteristics and\r\nproperties of certain stones, certain metals, certain creatures, with\r\ncorresponding human traits and faculties. He felt that such stones, or\r\nthe extraction of certain animal organs, would be conducive to the\r\nrealization of the virtues of these minerals or viscera in relation to\r\nthe human being. The lion’s bravery resides in the lion’s heart. Hence\r\nthe eating of the heart, by a kind of sympathetic transference, will\r\nrender the human consumer equally courageous. So the procedure extends\r\nthroughout the entire amatory field. Certain animals and birds, as the\r\npigeon and the ass and the goat and the bull, are known for their\r\nlubricity. The testes, therefore, and the genitalia of such animals will\r\ncorrespondingly endow the man who consumes them with equally intense\r\ncapacity. Certain formulas, particular invocations and ritualistic\r\nprocedures, diagrams and symbols and periapts will all contribute to the\r\nefficacy of the rite.\r\n\r\nThus, to stimulate desire in either sex, the genitalia of the animals of\r\nthe opposite sex are consumed.\r\n\r\nIn the nests of eagles are found stones called echites. Worn on the left\r\narm, these stones promote erotic sensations.\r\n\r\nTo ensure erotic continuance, the marrow of a wolf’s left foot is\r\nadvised. This is mixed with chypre and ambergris and the resultant\r\nunguent is rubbed on the object of affection.\r\n\r\nLike a culinary direction, but usually with less promptness or ease, one\r\nis enjoined to take the liver of a sparrow, a swallow’s womb, a hare’s\r\nkidney, a pigeon’s heart. Dry and crush into a powder. Add equal weight\r\nof one’s own blood. Dry and mix in soup as an infallible potion.\r\n\r\nFor reinvigorating purposes, an ointment composed of ash of star-lizard,\r\ncivet oil, St. John’s wort oil is prepared. This is smeared on the toe\r\nof the left foot and the loins.\r\n\r\nThe fat of a young buck, together with civet and ambergris, is equally\r\nefficacious.\r\n\r\nGoose testes and the stomach of a hare, well seasoned with spices, are\r\namatory aids.\r\n\r\nAlso: a salad made of satyrion, rocket, and celery, soaked in oil and\r\nrose vinegar.\r\n\r\nAs, in rarer cases, an anaphrodisiac, on the other hand, the powdered\r\ngenitals of a mild bull are recommended, in a soup containing veal,\r\npurslain, and lettuce.\r\n\r\nThe medieval grimoires, those manuals dedicated to sorcery, also treated\r\nof philtres and amatory brews.\r\n\r\nTake two new knives. On a Friday morning—the day that is consecrated to\r\nAphrodite—go to a spot where you can find earthworms. Take two, join the\r\ntwo knives together, then cut the two heads and the two tails of the\r\nworms. Keep the bodies. On returning home, smear them with sperm: dry,\r\nand pulverize them.\r\n\r\nAgain: Pull out three pubic hairs and three from the left armpit. Burn\r\nthem on a hot shovel. Pulverize, and insert in a piece of bread, that\r\nwill be dipped in soup.\r\n\r\nOr: With the left hand pluck a bunch of vervain and repeat: I pluck you\r\nby the power of Lucifer, Prince of the Infernal Regions, and of\r\nBeelzebub, mother of three demons. Let her send Attos, Effeton, and\r\nCanabo to torment X so that, within twenty-four hours, she may do my\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThere is a prescription against cuckoldry, involving the organs, the\r\nskin, and the eyes of a wolf: pounded and calcined and composed into a\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nAnother prescription, designed for amatory purposes, involves a loaf of\r\nwarm bread into which nine drops of blood are distilled. The bread is\r\nthen dried, pulverized, and taken with coffee.\r\n\r\nAnother recipe requires the fat and the bile of a goat, dried, and mixed\r\nwith oil. Its use will ensure faithful and continuous attachment to the\r\nperson loved.\r\n\r\nAnother device for maintaining enduring love requires two turtle doves,\r\nmale and female. After they are strangled, the blood is poured into a\r\ncup never before used. One’s own blood is added, together with some hair\r\nof the woman. On the first white page of a new Bible there is now\r\nwritten with a gold pen dipped in the turtle doves’ blood: Where you go,\r\nI shall go. Where you stay, I shall stay. Your people are my people and\r\nyour god is my god. I shall die where you die. Only death shall separate\r\nus. The document is sprinkled with incense and placed under the nuptial\r\npillow. The brew is poured into another cup, never before used, and\r\nmixed with wine. Each of the two persons concerned in the ceremony now\r\ntakes a drink.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn elaborate potion, that involves many ingredients, much time, and\r\ncareful and scrupulous preparation, is as follows:\r\n\r\nOn the first Friday after a summer new moon, go at noon and look for a\r\nsnake. Cut its head off, and carry it away in a new silk bag. Once home,\r\nthrow the stick used for killing the snake toward the East, and hang the\r\nbag in a dark, warm corner. The following night, go barefooted to a\r\nmeadow. Before midnight, gather two leaves of white clover, two of red\r\nclover, and six stems of spurge. Bring them back in a new basket. Then\r\ntake a white bud from two rose bushes, a red bud and a young leaf of\r\neach, wrap in virgin parchment on which you write: Revarin myrtol her\r\nkulbata with a new goose quill dipped in your own blood.\r\n\r\nThe leaves, their contents, and the basket are set at the head of the\r\nbed, on a table on which a lamp burns for at least three hours. On\r\nwaking up, spray the flowers and leaves with cold well water and set\r\nthem in the place where the snake’s head is drying. Wait until night.\r\nAbout eleven p.m. stretch out, on a table in the room, virgin parchment,\r\ndraw thereon with a fresh heated point a six-branched star, by the light\r\nof an old church taper placed in a silver holder.\r\n\r\nProcure a new chopper, two new knives, a new porcelain bowl, a new, well\r\nrinsed bottle, a black glass, a carafe of cold water, a stick of new\r\nwax, a seal, a mortar, and a new cork.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, make the sign of the cross three times. Then put the\r\nsnake’s head in the mortar with the leaves and flowers crushed into a\r\npaste. Heap up into a consistent mixture. Put the mortar on the flame\r\nuntil the contents are dry: then pulverize, while the mortar is heating.\r\n\r\nWith the new knives, let six drops of your blood fall into the cup: add\r\nwater, pour the contents of the mortar into the cup, stir, and boil.\r\nTake three of your hairs, calcine them and throw into the cup. Do\r\nlikewise with the parchment and the bag. Pour into the bottle, add water\r\nuntil it overflows. Cork it and seal it, place it in the bed, put out\r\nthe light, pray and go to sleep.\r\n\r\nAfter three days, after leaving it in the dark, by the window, on the\r\nthird midnight the brew will be ready. Five drops for men, three for\r\nwomen, mixed with drink or food.\r\n\r\nThis elixir was reputed to be highly effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n                         MIDDLE AGES AND LATER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the earlier Christian centuries, misogynistic attitudes were markedly\r\nprevalent, especially among the dogmatizing Church Fathers, and despite\r\nthe traditions of the _agape_. Clemens and Ambrose, Tertullian and\r\nAthanasius were impassioned and vociferous, both in their oral\r\ndenunciations, and in their written invectives against the essentially\r\nevil and malefic nature of woman.\r\n\r\nHence sexual love was anathema to them: and even marriage, grudgingly\r\nconceded but rarely accepted, was an object of horrified scorn. In\r\nconsequence, it was not surprising that sexual interests and activities\r\nshould go underground, as it were, and that amatory aids and\r\nencouragements likewise developed their secretive hiding places, their\r\nesoteric emporia, their identifiable but undisclosed havens.\r\n\r\nThe result was that, as the Middle Ages advanced, two basic views\r\nappeared to come into force. Laws that governed the marriage ceremonial\r\nand its consequent domestic involvements and possessive obligations. And\r\nlaws that related to love as such, to the _amor naturalis_, as defined\r\nby St. Thomas Aquinas, both in its romantic sense as a kind of amatory\r\nbut undefined ideal, and in its sexual implications that reached as far\r\nas adultery, under certain subdued, well-controlled, and unpublicized\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nAll these occasions created a hungry, frantic demand for philtres and\r\nphials and nostrums of all varieties, of all degrees of efficacy. They\r\nbloomed upon the markets, and gave employment and a vast impetus to\r\nquacks and adventurers, to alchemists and beldams, in furnishing the\r\ntantalizing apparatus of love.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most dominant humanists during the Middle Ages was Albertus\r\nMagnus (1193–1280). Of Germanic birth, he was educated in Padua and\r\nBologna. On account of his encyclopedic knowledge, he was generally\r\nknown as the Doctor Universalis.\r\n\r\nProfessor of theology, scientist, teacher, he achieved, both by his\r\nvoluminous writings and his lectures, an almost legendary reputation. In\r\none of his treatises, _De Secretis Mulierum_, he expounds on feminine\r\nmatters and then proceeds to discuss, in his _De Virtutibus Lapidum\r\nQuorundam Libellus_, the virtues and properties of certain precious and\r\nsemi-precious stones. In an amatory direction, Albertus Magnus gives\r\nsuggestions, as if they were prescriptive and categorically assertive,\r\non how to win the favor and affection of a person:\r\n\r\n    Take the stone called Chalcedony. It may be black or red, and is\r\n    extracted from the stomach of swallows. Wrap the red stone in a\r\n    linen cloth or in calf skin and place it under the left armpit.\r\n\r\nAlthough the philtre that is intended to inspire erotic excitations is\r\nnormally a drink, a fluid, Albertus Magnus’ recipe is virtually and in\r\nits ultimate sense a potion. He adds, on a later occasion in the same\r\ntext:\r\n\r\n    If you want to promote love between two people, take the stone\r\n    called Echites, by some termed Aquileus—because eagles place it\r\n    in their nests. It is purple in color and is found on the sea\r\n    shore: sometimes, too, in Persia. And it always contains within\r\n    itself another stone that makes a sound when moved. The ancient\r\n    philosophers say that this stone, worn suspended on the left\r\n    arm, effects love between a man and a woman.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, a certain Arnold of Villanova, a physician\r\nwho traveled widely throughout Europe and in Africa, was reputed to be a\r\npowerful karcist, believed to have occult contacts and interests. He\r\ndabbled, also, in alchemy, and, as legend rumored, was proficient in\r\nactual transmutations. In his medical practice he relied largely on\r\nherbal concoctions, on magic formulas, on amatory potions prepared\r\naccording to traditional prescriptions.\r\n\r\nPotions and love philtres pervaded all life, at all levels, throughout\r\nthe middle centuries. Peasant and pilgrim resorted to aged creatures who\r\nwere reputed to possess cryptic formulas, hidden resources transmitted\r\nto them orally by their forbears. Even in the Eucharistic rite the\r\n_poculum amatorium_ made its contorted intrusion. In the Eucharistic\r\nrite, the wafer often became an ingredient in love potions and acquired\r\na particularly efficacious renown.\r\n\r\nMost dealings in love devices, secret formulas, erotic phials, were\r\nnameless, both the client and the practitioners remaining unknown by\r\nname to each other. Until the practitioner became so assertive, so\r\nprosperous and so much in demand that people flocked from remote\r\nregions, from distant cities, from foreign countries, to acquire the\r\nultimate elixir. Count Alessandro Cagliostro was shrewd and unscrupulous\r\nenough to profit by such conditions. He was an Italian alchemist,\r\nmagician, and hermetic, but basically his qualifications and capacities\r\nwere at least dubious. What was not at all dubious was his facility in\r\noutwitting all Europe, in amassing great wealth from gullible clients,\r\nin escaping, on all but the ultimate occasion, from merited penalties.\r\nHis original name was Giuseppe Balsamo, and his restless life extended\r\nfrom 1745 to 1795.\r\n\r\nIn the heyday of his quackery he became both known and notorious\r\nthroughout Europe. He was _persona gratissima_ among the most\r\ndistinguished social circles and families. With the aid of his wife\r\nLorenza Feliccani he amassed enormous wealth by the sale of alchemical\r\ncompounds, magic elixirs, and love potions. Scandals followed his\r\nmovements and implicated him in fantastic incidents, salacious episodes.\r\nHence, for security or secrecy, he was constantly changing his abode. In\r\nhis last years, he suffered imprisonment, in the fortress of San Leo.\r\nAnd with his death, the legends proliferated and multiplied. Strange\r\nfeats were recorded of him. Mystic phenomena appeared at his potent\r\nwill. According to such traditions, he was a necromancer, having\r\nexorcised a dead woman. At a public banquet he invoked the dead spirits\r\nof Diderot and Voltaire. And he was the founder of a secret organization\r\nknown as The Egyptian Lodge, where goetic practices and sorcery were\r\nattempted and consummated.\r\n\r\nCagliostro had a kind of counterpart in the arcane arts. Catherine La\r\nVoisin was a notorious French fortune-teller, as well as a reputed\r\nwitch. For the most part, she was a dispenser of love philtres, and\r\nplied her sinister trade in low and high circles. In this capacity she\r\nwas intimately associated with the obscene and erotic operations of\r\nMadame de Montespan. Madame de Montespan, mistress of King Louis XIV of\r\nFrance, reached a point where her amatory offerings no longer aroused\r\nthe King. Steps had to be taken, urgently and effectively, to recover\r\nthat affection. With the aid of Catherine La Voisin, she concocted love\r\nphiltres. She participated in magical rites, in amatory Masses, and even\r\nin child sacrifice, to gain her passionate purpose. In this sinister\r\nmachination she enlisted the support of a notorious Abbé Guibourg. His\r\nscatological and lascivious activities in this respect brought about his\r\narrest, and his summary execution.\r\n\r\nThe love-potion, then, could be, potentially, a tremendously evil force,\r\na malefic and fatal weapon, an instrument of ruin and death. But usually\r\nthe potion was associated with soft and luxurious dalliance, with\r\namorous whisperings, with marital exchanges and sophisticated deceits.\r\nSo it was in Italy in particular. In the sixteenth century, many\r\nJewesses dabbled in love potions and amatory charms. They practiced\r\ntheir skill in Rome itself, and acquired an established reputation as\r\npurveyors of these physiological stimuli. Ferdinand Gregorovius, who\r\nproduced a monumental history of Rome, declares that Jewish women brewed\r\nlove philtres in the dark of the night, for their languishing customers,\r\nthe ladies of Rome.\r\n\r\nLippold, a Jewish financier of the Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg,\r\nwho also belongs in the sixteenth century, was accused, among other\r\ncharges based on magic practices, of dispensing recipes for the\r\nconcoction of love philtres. He was brutally tortured: then executed in\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\nThe medieval era was a period of absorption of the past, with occasional\r\ntentative gropings and some experimentation in new directions. In the\r\nerotic sphere, the Middle Ages adopted this antique heritage, at times\r\nmoulded and modified it, and sometimes made use of it in new contexts.\r\nThus there was in use an aromatic herb called popularly Sweet Flag. This\r\nwas the plant known anciently as acorus calamus, that the Romans\r\nbelieved to be endowed with erotic stimulus. It was appropriately known\r\nto them by the alternate name of the plant of Venus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn their tenebrous laboratories, equipped with weird paraphernalia, lit\r\nby the glow of furnace fire, the experimenting alchemists busied\r\nthemselves with their apparatus. On tables and benches stood, in\r\nconfused array, retorts of fantastic shape, flasks and tubes, alembics\r\nand phials containing strange viscous multi-colored fluids, fungus\r\ngrowths, particles of obscene matter, unnameable secretions. Some\r\nliquids, under the influence of tiny flames, hissed and spluttered with\r\ncunning animation. All these brews were undergoing action by fire and\r\nintermingling of chemicals, were being forced into mutations and\r\ndirections for horrendous ends: and, dominantly among these objectives,\r\nwas the illusive mutation into gold, but also the discovery of the\r\nsource of being, the elixir of life, the rejuvenating creative essence\r\nthat would promote youthfulness and vigor, passion and potency.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe medieval occultist and the alchemist did not always remain, as\r\ntradition believed, secluded in their own ivory tower, or rather in\r\ntheir laboratories. In many senses, they were decided realists, and they\r\nmade profitable use of their knowledge and experimentations in the\r\ndirection of astrological horoscopes, fortune-telling, and the\r\npreparation of philtres. There was, particularly, a potion in great\r\ndemand among amorous but disappointed swains of every degree and rank.\r\nIt was, according to general hearsay, a beverage whose basic ingredient\r\nwas gold. The preparation was consumed daily, over a space of time, as a\r\nkind of amatory potable gold.\r\n\r\nMany types of potions were resorted to in the Middle Ages. Some acted as\r\nphysiological excitants, but involved great circumspection in securing\r\nthe ingredients. These ingredients were often organic fragments: hair of\r\nthe beloved one obtained surreptitiously. Or nail parings. Or a shred\r\ntorn from an intimately worn garment. Such items were then burned, and,\r\nwhen reduced to ashes, mixed with wine and used as a philtre.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, all sorts of putatively effective concoctions, never of\r\ncourse analyzed as to the contents by the passionate pursuer, were\r\ninvolved. They were freely sold in the market towns of medieval Europe,\r\nin battlemented castles, in remote hamlets. They were brought as elixirs\r\nby returning travelers from distant countries, and were eagerly\r\npurchased in the ports and capitals of the continent. Especially when\r\nthese travelers reinforced their importations with tales and anecdotes\r\nthat testified to the amazing virtues of their brews.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Elizabethan Age is noted for its tremendous intellectual\r\nproductivity, for its relish in living, its adventurous ways on the high\r\nseas, in exploration, in colonization, in discovery. In the drama, in\r\nthe plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, of Marlowe and Ford and Ben Jonson\r\nand Thomas Dekker, the social and erotic phases of this tumultuous era\r\nplay no mean or insignificant role. In palace and hut, in court and\r\nmanor, the primary motif was love, in all its tantalizing\r\nmanifestations. Love pervaded all. And the instruments for promoting\r\nlove were all important, transcending domesticity and tranquillity,\r\nhonor and ethics. The secretive drug, the rare pill, the poculum\r\namatorium, the brew distilled by the wizened alchemist, the imported\r\nphiltre, the dramatic potion are all made contributory to the\r\nfurtherance of love and lust, to erotic subjugation, conquest, and\r\nmastery.\r\n\r\nThe corpus of Shakespearean plays, as an instance, contains a number of\r\nallusions to concoctions relating to amorous experiences. In _A\r\nMidsummer Night’s Dream_, Act 3, Scene 2, Oberon, King of the Fairies,\r\naddresses Puck:\r\n\r\n             This falls out better than I could devise.\r\n             But hast thou yet latched the Athenian’s eyes\r\n             With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?\r\n\r\n    Puck: I took him sleeping—that is finished too— And the Athenian\r\n    woman by his side; That, when he waked, of force she must be\r\n    eyed.\r\n\r\nLater, in the same play, another reference of the same kind appears:\r\n\r\n         Oberon: What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite,\r\n           and laid the love-juice on some true-love’s sight.\r\n           Of thy misprision must perforce ensue\r\n           Some true love turned, and not a false-turned true.\r\n\r\nFurther on, in the same act, Lysander, in love with Hermia, addresses\r\nher thus:\r\n\r\n            Lysander: Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!\r\n              Out, loathed med’cine! O, hated potion, hence!\r\n\r\nIn _The Winters Tale_, Act 1, Scene 2, Camillo, Lord of Sicilia,\r\naddresses Leontes, King of Sicilia:\r\n\r\n           Camillo:      Say, my lord,\r\n             I could do this, and that with no rash potion,\r\n             But with a ling’ring dram, that should not work\r\n             Maliciously like poison: but I cannot\r\n             Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress\r\n             (So sovereignly being honorable!)\r\n             T’have loved the ...\r\n\r\nIn _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, Act 3, Scene 1, the Host says to Caius:\r\n\r\n    Shall I lose my doctor? no; he gives me the potions and the\r\n    motions.\r\n\r\nIn _Pericles_, Act 1, Scene 2, Pericles addresses Helicanus:\r\n\r\n             Thou speak’st like a physician, Helicanus,\r\n             That ministers a potion unto me\r\n             That thou would’st tremble to receive thyself.\r\n\r\nIn Part 1, Henry IV, Act 5, Scene 3, the Prince of Wales speaks:\r\n\r\n              The insulting hand of Douglas over you,\r\n              Which would have been as speedy in your end\r\n              As all the poisonous potions in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd again, in Part 2, Act 1, Scene 1, Morton declares:\r\n\r\n            And they did fight with queasiness, constrain’d,\r\n            As men drink potions.\r\n\r\nIn these previously cited instances, in the Shakespearean contexts, it\r\nis evident that the term potion had often a malefic connotation,\r\nimplying venom and destruction in its use. But it was equally a term of\r\namatory and sensual significance, associated largely with physiological\r\nrefreshment.\r\n\r\nIn _Dr. Faustus_, Christopher Marlowe’s drama, the protagonist,\r\npassionately eager to embrace all knowledge that offers power, that is,\r\nthe thaumaturgic and necromantic skills, exclaims:\r\n\r\n                ’Tis magic, magic that hath ravished me.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds, after his pact with Mephistopheles, to demand the\r\nimplementation of the conditions. He is aroused erotically, and\r\ncommands:\r\n\r\n                          let me have a wife,\r\n                    The fairest maid in Germany;\r\n                    For I am wanton and lascivious,\r\n                    And cannot live without a wife\r\n\r\nMephistopheles, virtually a pander, suggesting provocative amatory\r\ndelights, promises:\r\n\r\n                Tut, Faustus,\r\n          Marriage is but a ceremonial toy;\r\n          And if thou lovest me, think no more of it.\r\n          I’ll cull thee out the fairest courtesans,\r\n          And bring them every morning to thy bed;\r\n          She whom thine eye shall like, thy heart shall have,\r\n          Be she as chaste as was Penelope,\r\n          And as wise as Saba, or as beautiful\r\n          As was bright Lucifer before his fall.\r\n\r\nIn a later scene, Robin the Ostler appears with one of Dr. Faustus’\r\ngrimoires:\r\n\r\n    Robin: Oh, this is admirable! here I ha’ stolen one of Doctor\r\n    Faustus’ conjuring books, and i’ faith I mean to search some\r\n    circles for my own use. Now will I make all the maidens in our\r\n    parish dance at my pleasure, stark-naked before me; and so by\r\n    that means I shall see more than e’er I felt or saw yet.\r\n\r\n                       Enter Rafe calling Robin.\r\n\r\n    Rafe: Robin, prithee, come away; there’s a gentleman tarries to\r\n    have his horse, and he would have his things rubbed and made\r\n    clean: he keeps such a chafing with my mistress about it; and\r\n    she has sent me to look thee out. Prithee, come away.\r\n\r\n    Robin: Keep out, keep out, or else you are blown up; you are\r\n    dismembered, Rafe: keep out, for I am about a roaring piece of\r\n    work.\r\n\r\n    Rafe: Come, what dost thou with that same book? Thou cans’t not\r\n    read.\r\n\r\n    Robin: Yes, my master and mistress shall find that I can read,\r\n    he for his forehead, she for her private study; she’s born to\r\n    bear with me, or else my art fails.\r\n\r\n    Rafe: Why, Robin, what book is that?\r\n\r\n    Robin: What book! Why, the most intolerable book for conjuring\r\n    that e’er was invented by any brimstone devil.\r\n\r\n    Rafe: Can’st thou conjure with it?\r\n\r\n    Robin: I can do all these things easily with it; first, I can\r\n    make thee drunk with ippocras at any tavern in Europe for\r\n    nothing; that’s one of my conjuring works.\r\n\r\n    Rafe: Our Master Parson says that’s nothing.\r\n\r\n    Robin: True, Rafe; and more, Rafe, if thou hast any mind to Nan\r\n    Spit, our kitchenmaid, then turn her and wind her to thy own use\r\n    as often as thou wilt, and at midnight.\r\n\r\n    Rafe: O brave Robin, shall I have Nan Spit, and to mine own use?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrequently consulted on erotic difficulties were the ubiquitous witches\r\nwho flourished in the Middle Ages throughout the European continent. In\r\nthe literature of these middle centuries their amatory brews are used in\r\na variety of passionate situations, to inspire love, to divert it into\r\nstrange channels, and, sometimes, to crush it. On occasion the repulsive\r\nand abhorrent ingredients, both animal and human, are noted with a land\r\nof macabre relish. But the urgent suppliant, bent on his lustful\r\nself-appointed mission, rarely hesitated on that account. On the\r\ncontrary, the rare or obscene nature of the brew was like an added spurt\r\nto his frantic libido: and the more distasteful the composition, the\r\nmore intense the lustfulness that was so inspired.\r\n\r\nIt was not unusual for the philtres and preparations to contain animal\r\ntestes, genitalia, human excremental matter, even fragments and shreds\r\nof human corpses, torn from graveyards and charnel-houses.\r\n\r\nAn extreme type of potion, administered in febrile cases, was actual\r\nblood, drunk by both man and woman.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages, particularly the eleventh century, was noted for its\r\nloose morality, its amorous diversions, its disregard of the old rigid\r\ndomestic or social prohibitions and restraints. Achievement followed on\r\ndesire, and sensuous and sensual whims met with ready acquiescence.\r\nReturning warriors, home from the Crusades in Palestine, or the\r\ncampaigns in Spain, had, during the course of their embattled\r\nactivities, come in contact with disturbing exotic women, so different,\r\nin both physical appearance and temperament, from the wives and women\r\nthey had left in the châteaux and manors. These exotic women were\r\nbrought back by the returning victors as captives. Once returned, the\r\nwarriors looked back with something of nostalgia to their colorful days\r\nin foreign regions and in novel circumstances. Hence the captive women\r\nbecame a kind of live substitute for such meditations. The women\r\nconsoled the warriors with murmurous love songs of their own country,\r\nsorrowful and prideful and exotic. And often the wives of these lords of\r\nthe manor were unpleasantly surprised when these strange women were\r\ninvited to domesticity as concubines. So that the medieval nobility\r\nbecame, in the course of time, a complicated series of relationships,\r\ntainted with harlotries and illegitimacies.\r\n\r\nIn these libidinous and licentious conditions, when exhaustion or age\r\nbegan to make perceptible appearance, amatory aids were sought, and\r\nphiltres and brews were hopefully measured out by the furtive creatures,\r\nmale and female, peripatetic vendors, sorceresses, quacks and\r\noccultists, who were always equipped, always prepared, to supply the\r\npassionate clamor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe medieval passion for love aroused complications. Particularly, it\r\naroused jealousy in the husband himself, however gallant or wayward he\r\nmight be. Lovers or husbands, discovering the indiscretions and\r\nsportiveness of a mistress, a concubine, or a wife, exacted the utmost\r\nand not rarely the most barbaric penalties. A wife was compelled to eat\r\nher dead lover’s heart. Another wife was forced to congregate with\r\nlepers because her conduct enraged her lawful spouse. One husband served\r\nup the heart of the slain adulterer in the form of a stew for his wife.\r\n\r\nYet the husband appeared to be exempt from any penalties inflicted for\r\ndivergent amorous experiences in which he himself might be involved. For\r\nthe man was dominant. The husband was equated with the ineluctable law.\r\nAnd the husband imposed that law upon his womankind. The male might\r\nconsequently indulge with more than a fair chance of impunity in\r\nadultery, fornication, excessive lust.\r\n\r\nAnd when these excitements seemed ultimately to approach physiological\r\nimpairment, there was always the nostrum, and the extended hand of the\r\naged crone, offering her mystic potion, her amatory panacea.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe permutations of amatory complications in the social frame of the\r\nMiddle Ages, involving peasant and noble, troubadour and harlot,\r\noccasional damsels, poets, mistresses and concubines, resulted sometimes\r\nin a frantic movement toward chastity. Renunciation of carnal delights,\r\nof the amor naturalis that implied physical and sensual love only,\r\nbecame a pose, then a principle, then a habit, however, at times, it\r\nmight be infringed or dishonored.\r\n\r\nChastity belts were devised by departing warriors to enforce continence\r\nupon their wives. Chastity tests, ingeniously contrived, became popular\r\nexperiments in sexual restraints. It was the vogue, and the vogue became\r\nmores. Just as Tristan and Yseult slept with a naked sword between them.\r\n\r\nAnd in excessive cases there was the weird but apparently effective\r\ndevice, for propagation purposes only, of the chemise cagoule.\r\n\r\nAnd always, in the wake of these temporary waves of contrition or\r\nrepentance, there followed, as a consequence of plague, violence,\r\npolitical unrest, banditry and war, a terrifying unleashing of all human\r\ninhibitions, a bacchanalian orgy of prolonged lechery and debauchery,\r\nreminiscent of Thucydides’ dramatic account of the Athenian plague\r\nduring the Peloponnesian War.\r\n\r\nIn the aftermath of these lecheries there arose perplexities,\r\ncomplications in erotic directions, incapacity through perversions and\r\nexcesses: and a consequent hungry, voracious quest for remedial\r\nmeasures: drugs and drinks devised by itinerant traders, nostrums\r\ncompounded by wily serfs and jongleurs, alchemical elixirs distilled in\r\nsecret dens by putative adepts.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWomen, in an amatory sense, were far from neglected in the Middle Ages.\r\nMany handbooks appeared that offered hints and guidance on dress,\r\ndeportment, osculation and its limitations, social behavior,\r\ncleanliness, bathing and washing.\r\n\r\nAnd if the object of the woman’s passion was preoccupied elsewhere, or\r\nhesitant, or indifferent to her insistence or her personal charms, there\r\nwas always recourse to the potion, by means of which she could have her\r\nway.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn France, in the Middle Ages, prostitution was so rampant and seeped\r\ninto the life of the people and the nobility to such an alarming extent\r\nthat the pious King Saint Louis, who flourished in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, promulgated a series of stringent decrees against prostitutes.\r\n\r\nYet Paris was notoriously populated with prostitutes. They practiced\r\ntheir occupation day and night, except on sacred days, in the most\r\nobscure rendez-vous, in inns and bath houses and cellars. François\r\nVillon, the poet of the brothel, and one of the chief sources for these\r\ndays, casts a lurid but realistic light on this phase of the medieval\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nPhiltres were a common commodity in these circumstances, in spite of the\r\nspread of disease. For le mal de Naples, as it was virtuously called in\r\nFrance, but which the Italians as virtuously termed le mal français, was\r\nravaging Europe. The disease, to give it its modern name, was syphilis.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough the Middle Ages were intimately familiar with love and lust in\r\nall its lawful as well as its secretive phases, the amatory state itself\r\noccasioned such temperamental and physiological and characterial changes\r\nin the aspirant or the postulant that the question arose: Was love\r\nitself worth while?\r\n\r\nThis question was specifically asked by Andreas Capellanus, who belongs\r\nin the thirteenth century. He produced a handbook on the Art of Courtly\r\nLove, in which he listed rules, and gave directions, in connection with\r\nthe conduct of the lover who is involved in a spiritual passion for the\r\nknight’s wife, the queen, or a mistress of a manor.\r\n\r\nYet Andreas Capellanus also gives a sober, solemn warning against the\r\nill effects of love, for of all disastrous results, it makes men old\r\nwith untimely rapidity. Women, then, the source of this malefic\r\nconsequence, should be shunned. They are avaricious. They are ruthless.\r\nThey are faithless. They are dishonorable. This invective recalls a\r\nremarkably similar assault on women and their ways, the thunderous,\r\ncondemnatory, bitter satire on women by the Roman satirist Juvenal.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages amatory broths were in such demand that the most\r\nobscure, the most nauseating, and sometimes actually venomous items were\r\nindiscriminately compounded into philtres. Intimate human secretions,\r\nblood, animal semen and other discharges, formed the fluid basis for the\r\nincorporation of genitalia of animals, macerated sparrow brains, and\r\nanalogous animal matter.\r\n\r\nSuch concoctions were designed to correct physiological disorders and\r\nnatural weaknesses and defects in the person so affected.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant treatises on love, applicable in its\r\nessential features to every age, although produced in the Middle Ages,\r\nis _Le Roman de la Rose_. It is an erotic allegory, begun in 1240 by\r\nGuillaume de Lorris, and completed in 1280 by Jean de Meun: a remote\r\npartnership that was nevertheless so effective as to make the book\r\ncontinuously popular for several centuries.\r\n\r\nThere are numberless precepts and suggestions regarding the material\r\nphases of love: personal appearance, social accomplishments, and in a\r\nmore general way the requisite mode of behavior for the amatory\r\nsuppliant. Above all, insistence is on giving free rein to passion and\r\non indulging in every conceivable variety of erotic voluptuousness and\r\nsensual pleasure. And women, the treatise reminds one, are essentially\r\nas free as men in this respect. So that, when the passions subside and\r\nrequire increased fuel, the potion could be sought equally by men and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe philtre appears in imaginative literature no less than in actuality.\r\nThe Wagnerian opera based on the Tristan and Yseult legend presents a\r\nheroine who is far from the submissive and dutiful medieval female,\r\nsubservient to her amorous lord and master. She is highly selfish in her\r\nways, and her love for Tristan is conditioned by the administration of a\r\nlove-potion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMedieval mortality distinguished between conjugal love and sexual love\r\nthat extended, on the part of both husband and wife, beyond the domestic\r\nfrontiers. Hence in many instances an insistent lover would resort to\r\nsome provocative potion in order to bring the amatory objective into\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most ravishing women in all history was Diane de Poitiers,\r\nwho for some three decades was the mistress of the French king Henri II.\r\nHer beauty remained untarnished far beyond the usually allotted span.\r\nShe was imitated by every woman: in her manner of walking, her hair\r\nstyles, her general behavior. All society, all France was at her feet as\r\nthe unattainable ideal woman. And she remained so long after her death.\r\n\r\nThose who were particularly inquisitive about Diane de Poitiers’ method\r\nof prolonged beauty, whispered, and general gossip supported the belief,\r\nthat the continuance of her appealing and attractive charms was due to\r\ncertain potent love philtres that she had regularly used.\r\n\r\nBefore her death, Diane de Poitiers revealed what was evidently the\r\ncomposition of the potion. Every morning, she declared, she had been in\r\nthe habit of drinking a liquid consisting of molten gold and certain\r\nunrevealed drugs that had been recommended by alchemists.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is curious to discover that sensual and sexual voluptuousness and\r\namorous contests, whether accepted according to traditional principles\r\nor forbidden and experienced secretly, could find a vociferous,\r\narticulate opponent. Yet in 1599 such an attack on loose morality and\r\nlicentious freedom was published under the title of _Antidote for Love,\r\nwith a lengthy Discourse on the Nature and Causes thereof, together with\r\nthe most singular Remedies for the Prevention and Cure of Amorous\r\nPassions_. The author was a Frenchman, a certain Dr. Jean Aubery.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo stimulate genital vigor, the French in the Middle Ages advocated, as\r\na complement to physiological activity, verbal love making. Oral\r\ncaresses, endearing diminutives, the poetic battery of language that was\r\nso familiar to the ancient poets, to Alciphron and Theocritus, to\r\nPlautus, to Catullus, to Horace, came into popular use again. One\r\nchronicler devotes himself to some extent to this phase of amorous\r\nconquest. He recommends erotic murmurings, whisperings, coaxings,\r\nendearments. And without question such recommendations were generally\r\nreinforced with anatomical and sexual terms, obscene and scatological\r\nreferences, that strengthened the lascivious gestures and contortions of\r\nthe participants. Similarly, in Spain and in Italy perfumes began to\r\nacquire their amatory appeal and value, and added their subtle\r\nallurements and insinuations to a potion, or to an erotic phial.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Le Tableau de l’Amour Conjugal_ was a kind of amatory encyclopedia,\r\nfirst published in 1696. The author was a Frenchman, a Dr. Nicolas\r\nVenette. In addition to a great deal of matter on amatory subjects, the\r\neffects of excesses, the causes of the validity of marriage, continence\r\nand debauchery, there were also discussions on physiological conditions,\r\nsexual relations, theories on the humors, on male and female\r\ntemperaments and peculiarities.\r\n\r\nIn respect of stimulants, Dr. Venette recommended, among other arousing\r\npotions, crocodile kidneys. These were to be dried, then pounded into a\r\npowder, to which was added sweet wine. The result, according to Dr.\r\nVenette, was amazingly effective.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn eighteenth century France, _la vie galante_ had grown to such\r\nproportions socially that many clubs were established, devoted\r\nexclusively and fantastically to licentious erotic practices, to the\r\ndissemination of amatory gossip and tales of well-known personalities,\r\nprominent in contemporary life, who were addicted, orgiastically and\r\nwith abandonment, to amorous mores. There were even publications that\r\npublished spicy titbits about such characters, without disguise of name\r\nor circumstance.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong such clubs were La Société Joyeuse, Les Sunamites, La Paroisse,\r\nand Les Aphrodites. One group, called Les Restauratrices, used the\r\nmethods and manipulations and stimulating potions and drugs that are so\r\nvividly described in Petronius’ Roman novel of the _Satyricon_. It was\r\nevident, then, that Les Restauratrices served men who had degenerated\r\nphysiologically through age or extreme excesses.\r\n\r\nThese clubs recognized no amatory restraints whatever. They indulged in\r\ninvented, ingenious permutations of amorous exercises, both privately\r\nand publicly, and even held competitions to decide the superior potency\r\nof members. The frequenters were ranked, in regard to prestige and\r\ndistinction, according to the numerical extent of their encounters.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBirds and game were commonly used in amatory tonics. The medieval\r\ngrimoires and manuals are packed with references to preparations that\r\ninvolve all parts of the bird as ingredients for erotic compounds. The\r\nphilosopher and occultist Albertus Magnus, as an instance, who wrote on\r\na vast number of allied subjects, prescribes, in one of his treatises,\r\nthe brains of partridge, calcined into powder form, and steeped in red\r\nwine, as a prospective aid to vigor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe licentious courts of France often experimented and used whatever\r\nlotion, concoction, or substance might prove effective in stimulating\r\nwaning or exhausted capacities in the members of the court, both male\r\nand female. This quest grew to frantic and insidious proportions, for\r\nthe entire court was tainted with perversions, sexual excesses, and\r\nexploratory monstrosities. For this purpose, then, ambergris, which is\r\nan ash-colored substance secreted in the intestines of the sperm whale,\r\nwas used as a coating for chocolates, which were in the nature of\r\ntitbits designed to arouse the courtiers, lechers, and gallants. As a\r\nperfume, ambergris was intended to provoke, through osphresiological\r\nchannels, sensual attraction. Madame du Barry notoriously used ambergris\r\nas a means of ensuring Louis XV’s amatory interest.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly chroniclers, herbalists, and compilers of miscellaneous knowledge\r\noften refer to tonics, pastilles, and compounds as amatory specifics,\r\nbut provokingly do not name them. Thus in the Geneanthropoeia, virtually\r\na textbook on anatomy and sexology, produced in 1642 by an Italian\r\nprofessor of medicine named Johannes Benedict Sinibaldus, there is\r\nreference to a plant indigenous to the Atlas Mountains in North Africa.\r\nThis plant was reputedly of great erotic virtue. The difficulty lies in\r\nits identification.\r\n\r\nAllusion is similarly and frequently made to certain trees, shrubs, and\r\nherbs of India that have analogous properties.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth century in Europe became an age of debauchery and\r\ngluttony. It was the age of licentious drama, of lewd poetry, of\r\nunbridled lusts, of the overthrow of all moral and social restraints.\r\nThis was the situation notably in England, and in France.\r\n\r\nIt is known now, almost axiomatically, that foods, particularly meats\r\nand game, stimulate sensual desires. Hence, when there was an excess of\r\nsexual diversion, indiscriminate and pervasive through all classes of\r\nsociety as a result of over indulgence in food and equally in drink,\r\nthere was correspondingly a resultant physiological reaction, a\r\nweariness and incapacity and expenditure of energy that clamored for\r\nrenewal, for stimulants, brews and philtres to remedy this parlous\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the Orient, from Arabia to Japan, in the South Seas no\r\nless than in Africa, the basic sustenance is not animal flesh, but a\r\ndiet that is largely though not exclusively vegetarian.\r\n\r\nSuch a diet does not encourage erotic tendencies. In consequence, in the\r\nEast as well as in the West but for quite divergent reasons, there grew\r\nup, through the centuries, corpora and manuals of prescriptions,\r\ncontrivances, suggestions, and a diversity of aids conducive to amatory\r\nfunctions. In essence, the development was along the lines of an entire\r\naphrodisiac laboratory.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery conceivable substance, every presumed juice or blossom or spice\r\nwas worthy of a trial, of being tested for its impact on procreative\r\nactivity. So with borax. Refined and compounded into a beverage, borax\r\nwas, in the seventeenth century, reputed to pervade the entire organic\r\nframe, and to produce highly favorable physiological reactions in the\r\ngenital areas.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, borax was considered extremely dangerous in the view\r\nof practicing physicians, and its use was urgently deprecated, on\r\naccount of its concomitant poisonous effects.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century was the century of the French King, Louis XIV,\r\nLe Roi Soleil. And his reign and personal life, and the society that\r\nencircled his court, were an incessant round of lavish gaiety, gross and\r\nscatological obscenities, and the most flagrant immoralities. Among\r\nother infamous episodes that marked this period were the machinations of\r\nLouis’ mistress, Madame de Montespan. She was involved, according to\r\ncontemporary records, in poisoning one rival mistress and attempting the\r\nelimination of another by the same means. But chiefly Madame de\r\nMontespan is remembered for her febrile associations with sorceresses,\r\nreputed witches, whom she consulted for help in retaining King Louis’\r\naffection. The principal aide and accomplice in these furtive and\r\ninsidious operations was Catherine La Voison, a professed witch, a\r\npoisoner, a dealer in love-potions. It was from La Voisin that Madame de\r\nMontespan secured amatory charms and philtres.\r\n\r\nIn the issue, Madame de Montespan lost her intimate status with the\r\nKing, while La Voisin was burned alive in Paris.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century there appears in France The Great Almanach of\r\nLove. It contained directions for arousing sensual feelings. It\r\nsuggested music and songs, sonnets and madrigals. But it also\r\nrecommended, as more earthy enticements, meals that included a dish of\r\nbeans, turkey, and sweets. These items were virtually love philtres.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn old medieval custom, that lasted until well into this century in\r\nEurope, was in the nature of a nuptial love-potion.\r\n\r\nAfter a wedding feast, members of the village community set water to\r\nboil in a pot. Into the pot were thrown, in addition to pepper, garlic,\r\nand salt—which are essentially aphrodisiac in character—,less appetizing\r\ncontributions, such as spiders’ webs and soot. The entire compound was\r\nstirred into an unsavory mixture, but both the bride and the groom were\r\nrequired to take at least a mouthful.\r\n\r\nIn essence, this brew was designed to arouse excitations on the part of\r\nthe bridal pair, just as Plutarch refers to the bride nibbling fruit\r\nbefore retiring to bed.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn place of actual potions, the Middle Ages at times used what were\r\nessentially visual erotic stimulants. These were lewd pictures and\r\ndrawings that were in great vogue, extensively so in the reign of King\r\nFrançois I. Many among the French nobility made private collections of\r\nsuch provocative and scatological sketches that produced, in some cases,\r\nmarked inflammatory erotic reactions. In certain country châteaux, also,\r\nstained glass windows depicted salacious episodes, libidinous postures\r\nand embraces, just as the caves of Ajanta in India portrayed amatory\r\ncontortions in which human and animal performers were involved.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe subject of erotic practices, including perversions, abnormalities,\r\nflagellation, as well as philtres and amatory brews, was not limited to\r\nprofessional physicians. Many demonographers, including Martin Delrio,\r\nmentioned erotic techniques in their discussions and investigations of\r\nwitchcraft and the furtive operations of occultists. In 1520 there was\r\npublished a Latin text entitled _Fustigationes_, which involves\r\nreferences to love philtres. The author was a certain Grillandus, a\r\nFlorentine and also a member of the Inquisition at Arezzo.\r\n\r\nThrough the centuries, there were sporadic appearances of pamphlets and\r\nmiscellaneous pieces that had reference to amatory aids. For instance,\r\n_Le Jardin d’Amour_, published in 1798 by a certain Tansillo or\r\nTanzillo.\r\n\r\nEvery century, every country, every religious sect, had its own\r\nmonstrous obscenities, its peculiar orgiastic ceremonials, its gross and\r\nbestial manifestations, and its most unhallowed erotic permutations.\r\nSome of these phenomena were of a seclusive nature, confined to\r\ninitiates only. Others, more liberated or more daring, were associated\r\nwith royal courts, or temple worship, or even conventual life. Erotic\r\nacts, bestial performances, tribadism and fellatio and every other\r\nabnormality were all depicted in caves and church windows, woven in\r\ntapestries, or represented in ornamental furniture, etched in books,\r\nmoulded in statuary.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages, in particular, were the milieu, but of course not\r\nexclusively so, of political cataclysms and internecine wars, of plagues\r\nand intrigues and famine, of splendor and tournaments, jousts and\r\ncrusades, and also of servitude and witchcraft, gluttony and debauchery,\r\nmonastic life and religious reforms, art and poetry and lewdness.\r\n\r\nAll through the ages, notably during these middle eras, this dichotomy\r\nwas prevalent and manifest. And pervading and transcending all civic\r\nconditions, all national issues, was the erotic life of the teeming,\r\ninarticulate populace and the highly literate and cultured minorities:\r\nwanton prelates and easy princesses, libidinous serving maids and poetic\r\ngallants, romantic crusaders, lechers, perverts.\r\n\r\nThe history of these times is packed with religious lusts, with worship\r\nof the genitalia, with female devotees of Priapus, with amatory\r\nflagellations and erotic feasts, with sexuality rampant in full public\r\nview, with chastity belts and barbarous contraptions. The Latin\r\nchronicles and the Latin satirical writings, the Wandering Scholars’\r\nsongs and the anecdotes and tales that amused these centuries are filled\r\nwith abhorrent nudist practices, with adultery and incest, with\r\nprostitution and unholy commerce of holy devotees, with rape and sodomy.\r\nWe hear of the most unbridled, the most shameless doings from the\r\nchronicles of Godefroy and of Froissart, of Benevente and Grecourt. We\r\nread of obscene banquets under kingly sponsorship, of brothels under\r\nroyal patronage, of public gymnastic performances of harlots, of the\r\ndebaucheries of monks and canons and students, adventurers and\r\ncourtiers. We read of a monastery dedicated to prostitution, of parades\r\nof harlots, of foul sexual privileges exercised by the lords of the\r\nmanor, of the ius primae noctis and the droit de cuisse, and, in short,\r\nof an array, colossal in bulk and unspeakable in content, of every\r\nconceivable erotic fact.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThrough the ages, the knowledge of sexual and amatory artifices,\r\ncontraptions, inducements grew and multiplied in such variety, through\r\nlegend and experiment, through the accretions of poetic myths and\r\nhearsay, that a voluminous corpus was achieved. It comprehended\r\nincantations and fantasies, rare prescriptions, crude operative\r\ntechniques, formulas and incisions, superstitions and alchemical\r\nproducts, astrological cryptograms and Satanic supplications that were\r\nall assumed to be effective in guarding or in increasing amatory\r\npotency.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSexual procedures of all types and at varying levels were particularly\r\nprevalent in the Middle Ages. In addition, the clergy, according to the\r\ntestimony of contemporary songs and monastic chronicles and incidental\r\nreferences in drama and satire and history, were not altogether immune\r\nto such diversions. To promote asceticism, therefore, to diminish carnal\r\nlusts, various plants and drugs and other medicaments were employed in\r\nmonasteries to produce the desired anaphrodisiac condition. Agnus\r\ncastus, for example, which is now identified with the chaste-tree or\r\nAbraham’s balm, was credited with having decided cooling effects and\r\neliminating physiological urgencies.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn ingenious device that resulted in stifling the amatory advances of a\r\nking is related in Boccaccio’s _Decameron_: The Fifth Story of the First\r\nDay. King Phillippe of France, learning of the beauty of the Marchioness\r\nof Monferrato, journeys to her domain, in the absence of the Marquis. He\r\nis invited to a banquet:\r\n\r\n    The ordinance of the repast and of the viands she reserved to\r\n    herself alone and having forthright caused collect as many hens\r\n    as were in the country, she bade her cooks dress various dishes\r\n    of these alone for the royal table.\r\n\r\n    The king came at the appointed time and was received by the lady\r\n    with great honor and rejoicing. When he beheld her, she seemed\r\n    to him fair and noble and well-bred beyond that which he had\r\n    conceived from the courtier’s words, whereat he marvelled\r\n    exceedingly and commended her amain, waxing so much the hotter\r\n    in his desire as he found the lady over-passing his foregone\r\n    conceit of her. After he had taken somewhat of rest in chambers\r\n    adorned to the utmost with all that pertaineth to the\r\n    entertainment of such a king, the dinner hour being come, the\r\n    king and the marchioness seated themselves at one table, whilst\r\n    the rest, according to their quality, were honorably entertained\r\n    at others. The king, being served with many dishes in\r\n    succession, as well as with wines of the best and costliest, and\r\n    to boot gazing with delight the while upon the lovely\r\n    marchioness, was mightily pleased with his entertainment; but,\r\n    after awhile, as the viands followed one upon another, he began\r\n    somewhat to marvel, perceiving that, for all the diversity of\r\n    the dishes, they were nevertheless of nought other than hens,\r\n    and this although he knew the part where he was to be such as\r\n    should abound in game of various kinds and although he had, by\r\n    advising the lady in advance of his coming, given her time to\r\n    send a-hunting. However, much as he might marvel at this, he\r\n    chose not to take occasion of engaging her in parley thereof,\r\n    otherwise than in the matter of her hens, and accordingly,\r\n    turning to her with a merry air, ‘Madam,’ quoth he, ‘are hens\r\n    only born in these parts, without ever a cock?’ The marchioness,\r\n    who understood the king’s question excellent well, herseeming\r\n    God had vouchsafed her, according to her wish, an oportune\r\n    occasion of discovering her mind, turned to him and answered\r\n    boldly, ‘Nay, my lord; but women, albeit in apparel and\r\n    dignities they may differ somewhat from others, are natheless\r\n    all of the same fashion here as elsewhere.’\r\n\r\n    The King, hearing this, right well apprehended the meaning of\r\n    the banquet of hens and the virtue hidden in her speech and\r\n    perceived that words would be wasted upon such a lady, and that\r\n    violence was out of the question; wherefore, even as he had\r\n    ill-advisedly taken fire for her, so now it behoved him sagely,\r\n    for his own honor’s sake, stifle his ill-conceived passion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe medieval love poem, usually sung to an accompaniment on the lyre or\r\nother musical instrument, was often, in spite of its superficially\r\ninnocuous tone, full of amatory innuendoes and erotic provocations. The\r\nlove song, in fact, was virtually an amatory philtre intended to set the\r\nlistener afire, or to inspire the object of the implicit passion with an\r\nequal fervor, or to divert a passion in the direction of the songster.\r\nThe concluding story of the fifth day, in Boccaccio’s Decameron,\r\ncontains a song of this nature:\r\n\r\n                 O Love, the amorous light\r\n           That beameth from yon fair one’s lovely eyes\r\n           Hath made me thine and hers in servant-guise.\r\n           The splendor of her lovely eyes, it wrought\r\n           That first thy flames were kindled in my breast,\r\n               Passing thereto through mine;\r\n           Yea, and thy virtue first unto my thought\r\n           Her visage fair it was made manifest,\r\n                 Which picturing, I twine\r\n                 And lay before her shrine\r\n           All virtues, that to her I sacrifice,\r\n           Become the new occasion of my sighs.\r\n           Thus, dear my lord, thy vassal am I grown\r\n           And of thy might obediently await\r\n                 Grace for my lowliness;\r\n           Yet wot I not if wholly there be known\r\n               The high desire that in my breast thou’st set\r\n               And my sheer faith, no less,\r\n               Of her who doth possess\r\n           My heart so that from none beneath the skies,\r\n           Save her alone, peace would I take or prize.\r\n           Wherefore I pray thee, sweet my lord and sire,\r\n           Discover it to her and cause her taste\r\n               Some scantling of thy heat\r\n           To-me-ward,—for thou seest that in the fire,\r\n           Loving, I languish and for torment waste\r\n               By inches at her feet,—\r\n               And eke in season meet\r\n           Commend me to her favor on such wise\r\n           As I would plead for thee, should need arise.\r\n\r\nA similar song, from the maiden’s viewpoint, appears at the close of the\r\nlast story on the sixth day:\r\n\r\n    Then Pamfilo having, at his commandment, set up a dance, the\r\n    king turned to Elisa and said courteously to her, “Fair damsel,\r\n    thou hast today done me the honor of the crown and I purpose\r\n    this evening to do thee that of the song; wherefore look thou\r\n    sing such an one as most liketh thee.” Elisa answered, smiling,\r\n    that she would well and with dulcet voice began on this wise:\r\n\r\n            Love, from thy clutches could I but win free,\r\n                Hardly, methinks, again\r\n            Shall any other hook take hold on me.\r\n            I entered in thy wars a youngling maid,\r\n            Thinking thy strife was utmost peace and sweet,\r\n            And all my weapons on the ground I laid,\r\n            As one secure, undoubting of defeat;\r\n            But thou, false tyrant, with rapacious heat,\r\n            Didst fall on me amain\r\n            With all the grapnels of thine armory.\r\n\r\n            Then, wound about and fettered with thy chains,\r\n                To him, who for my death in evil hour\r\n            Was born, thou gav’st me, bounden, full of pains\r\n                And bitter tears; and syne within his power\r\n            He hath me and his rule’s so harsh and dour\r\n                No sighs can move the swain\r\n            Nor all my wasting plaints to set me free.\r\n            My prayers, the wild winds bear them all away;\r\n            He hearkeneth unto none and none will hear;\r\n            Wherefore each hour my torment waxeth aye;\r\n            I cannot die, albeit life irks me drear.\r\n            Ah, Lord, have pity on my heavy cheer;\r\n            Do that I seek in vain\r\n            And give him bounden in thy chains to me.\r\n            An this thou wilt not, at the least undo\r\n            The bonds erewhen of hope that knitted were;\r\n            Alack, O Lord, thereof to thee I sue,\r\n                For, an thou do it, yet to waxen fair\r\n                Again I trust, as was my use whilere,\r\n                And being quit of pain\r\n            Myself with white flowers and with red besee.\r\n\r\n    Elisa ended her song with a very plaintive sigh, and albeit all\r\n    marvelled at the words thereof, yet was there none who might\r\n    conceive what it was that caused her sing thus. But the king,\r\n    who was in a merry mood, calling for Tindaro, bade him bring out\r\n    his bagpipes, to the sound whereof he let dance many dances.\r\n\r\nAnother song, sung by Pamfilo, who represents Boccaccio himself, refers\r\nto the author’s amours with the Princess Maria of Naples—Fiammetta.\r\n\r\nThe song occurs at the end of the eighth day:\r\n\r\n    At last, the queen, to ensue the fashion of her predecessors,\r\n    commanded Pamfilo to sing a song, notwithstanding those which\r\n    sundry of the company had already sung of their free will; and\r\n    he readily began thus:\r\n\r\n              Such is thy pleasure, Love\r\n            And such the allegresse I feel thereby\r\n            That happy, burning in thy fire, am I.\r\n            The abounding gladness in my heart that glows,\r\n                  For the high joy and dear\r\n                  Whereto thou hast me led,\r\n            Unable to contain there, overflows\r\n                  And in my face’s cheer\r\n                  Displays my happihead: for being enamoured\r\n            In such a worship-worthy place and high\r\n            Makes eath to me the burning I aby.\r\n            I cannot with my finger what I feel\r\n                  Limn, Love, nor do I know\r\n                  By bliss in song to vent;\r\n            Nay, though I knew it, needs must I conceal,\r\n                  For, once divulged, I trow\r\n                  ’Twould turn to dreariment.\r\n                  Yet am I so content,\r\n            All speech were halt and feeble, did I try\r\n            The least thereof with words to signify.\r\n            Who might conceive it that these arms of mine\r\n                Should anywise attain\r\n                Whereas I’ve held them aye,\r\n            Or that my face should reach so fair a shrine\r\n                As that, of favor fain\r\n                And grace, I’ve won to? Nay,\r\n                Such fortune ne’er a day\r\n            Believed me were; whence all afire am I,\r\n            Hiding the source of my liesse thereby.\r\n\r\nThis was the end of Pamfilo’s song, whereto albeit it had been\r\ncompletely responded of all, there was none but noted the words thereof\r\nwith more attent solicitude than pertained unto him, studying to divine\r\nthat which, as he sang, it behoved him to keep hidden from them; and\r\nalthough sundry went imagining various things, nevertheless none\r\nhappened upon the truth of the case.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the end of the ninth day, Neifile sings:\r\n\r\nSupper at an end, they arose to the wonted dances, and after they had\r\nsung a thousand canzonets, more diverting of words than masterly of\r\nmusic, the king bade Neifile sing one in her own name; whereupon, with\r\nclear and blithesome voice, she cheerfully and without delay began thus:\r\n\r\n          A youngling maid am I and full of glee,\r\n            Am fain to carol in the new-blown May,\r\n          Love and sweet thoughts-a-mercy, blithe and free.\r\n          I go about the meads, considering\r\n                The vermeil flowers and golden and the white,\r\n                Roses thorn-set and lilies snowy-bright,\r\n          And one and all I fare a-likening\r\n          Unto his face who hath with love-liking\r\n          Ta’en and will hold me ever, having aye\r\n          None other wish than as his pleasures be;\r\n          Whereof when one I find me that doth show,\r\n            Unto my seeming, likest him, full fain\r\n            I cull and kiss and talk with it amain\r\n          And all my heart to it, as best I know,\r\n          Discover, with its store of wish and woe;\r\n          Then it with others in a wreath I lay,\r\n          Bound with my hair so golden-bright of blee.\r\n          Ay, and that pleasure which the eye doth prove,\r\n            By nature, of the flower’s view, like delight\r\n            Doth give me as I saw the very wight\r\n          Who hath inflamed me of his dulcet love,\r\n          And what its scent thereover and above\r\n          Worketh in me, no words indeed can say;\r\n          But sighs thereof bear witness true for me,\r\n          The which from out my bosom day nor night\r\n            Ne’er, as with other ladies, fierce and wild,\r\n            Storm up; nay, thence they issue warm and mild\r\n          And straight betake them to my loved one’s sight,\r\n                Who, hearing, moveth of himself, delight\r\n            To give me; ay, and when I’m like to say\r\n          “Ah come, lest I despair,” still cometh he.\r\n                  Again, on the tenth day, Fiammetta sings:\r\n          If love came but withouten jealousy,\r\n                  I know no lady born\r\n              So blithe as I were, whosoe’er she be.\r\n              If gladsome youthfulness\r\n              In a fair lover might content a maid,\r\n              Virtue and worth discreet,\r\n          Valiance or gentilesse,\r\n          wit and sweet speech and fashions all arrayed\r\n                  In pleasantness complete,\r\n                  Certes. I’m she for whose behoof these meet\r\n              In one; for, love-o’erborne,\r\n          All these in him who is my hope I see.\r\n          But for that I perceive\r\n                  That other women are as wise as I,\r\n                  I tremble for affright\r\n                  And tending to believe\r\n                  The worst, in others the desire espy\r\n                  Of him who steals my spright;\r\n\r\n          Thus this that is my good and chief delight\r\n          Enforceth me, forlorn,\r\n          Sigh sore and live in dole and misery.\r\n          If I knew fealty such\r\n              In him my lord as I know merit there,\r\n              I were not jealous, I;\r\n              But here is seen so much\r\n          Lovers to tempt, how true they be soe’er,\r\n              I hold all false; whereby\r\n            I’m all disconsolate and fain would die,\r\n          Of each with doubting torn\r\n          Who eyes him, lest she bear him off from me.\r\n            Be, then, each lady prayed\r\n                By God that she in this be not intent\r\n                ’Gainst me to do amiss;\r\n                For sure, if any maid\r\n                Should or with words or becks or blandishment\r\n                My detriment in this\r\n            Seek or procure and if I know’t, ywis,\r\n                Be all my charms forsworn\r\n          But I will make her rue it bitterly.\r\n\r\nScattered throughout the Decameron, there are other erotic songs too. At\r\nthe end of the first day:\r\n\r\n    Emilia amorously warbled the following song:\r\n\r\n       I burn for mine own charms with such a fire,\r\n           Methinketh that I ne’er\r\n       Of other love shall reck or have desire\r\n\r\n       Whene’er I mirror me, I see therein\r\n             That good which still contenteth heart and spright;\r\n       Nor fortune new nor thought of old can win\r\n       To dispossess me of such dear delight.\r\n       What other object, then, could fill my sight,\r\n         Enough of pleasance e’er\r\n       To kindle in my breast a new desire?\r\n\r\n       This good flees not, what time soe’er I’m fain\r\n         Afresh to view it for my solacement;\r\n       Nay, at my pleasure, ever and again\r\n         With such a grace it doth itself present\r\n       Speech cannot tell it nor its full intent\r\n         Be known of mortal e’er,\r\n       Except indeed he burn with like desire.\r\n\r\n       And I, grown more enamoured every hour,\r\n         The straitlier fixed mine eyes upon it be,\r\n       Give all myself and yield me to its power,\r\n         E’en tasting now of that it promised me,\r\n         And greater joyance yet I hope to see,\r\n           Of such a strain as ne’er\r\n       Was proven here below of love-desire.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second day, the ditty following was sung by Pampinea:\r\n\r\n         What lady aye should sing, and if not I,\r\n         Who’m blest with all for which a maid can sigh.\r\n         Come then, O love, thou source of all my weal,\r\n           All hope and every issue glad and bright\r\n           Sing ye awhile yfere\r\n         Of sighs nor bitter pains I erst did feel,\r\n         That now but sweeten to me thy delight,\r\n         Nay, but of that fire clear,\r\n         Wherein I, burning, live in joy and cheer,\r\n         And as my God, thy name do magnify.\r\n\r\n         Thou settest, Love, before these eyes of mine\r\n           Whenas thy fire I entered the first day,\r\n           A youngling so beseen\r\n         with valor, worth and loveliness divine,\r\n         That never might one find a goodlier, nay,\r\n           Nor yet his match, I ween.\r\n           So sore I burnt for him I still must e’en\r\n         Sing, blithe, of him with thee, my lord most high.\r\n\r\n         And that in him which crowneth my liesse\r\n           Is that I please him, as he pleaseth me,\r\n                   Thanks to Love debonair;\r\n         Thus in this world my wish I do possess\r\n               And in the next I trust at peace to be,\r\n                   Through that fast faith I bear\r\n                   To him; sure God, who seeth this, will ne’er\r\n         The kingdom of His bliss to us deny.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the third day, Lauretta began thus:\r\n\r\n         No maid disconsolate hath cause as I, alack!\r\n         Who sigh for love in vain, to mourn her fate.\r\n\r\n         He who moves heaven and all the stars in air\r\n           made me for His delight\r\n         Lovesome and sprightly, kind and debonair,\r\n         E’en here below to give each lofty spright\r\n         Some inkling of that fair\r\n               That still in heaven abideth in His sight;\r\n         But erring men’s unright,\r\n         Ill knowing me, my worth\r\n         Accepted not, nay, with dispraise did bate.\r\n         Erst was there one who held me dear and fain\r\n             Took me, a youngling maid,\r\n         Into his arms and thought and heart and brain,\r\n             Caught fire at my sweet eyes; yea, time, unstayed\r\n         Of aught, that flits amain\r\n               And lightly, all to wooing me he laid.\r\n         I, courteous, nought gainsaid\r\n               And held him worthy me;\r\n         But now, woe’s me, of him\r\n               I’m desolate.\r\n         Then unto me there did himself present\r\n           A youngling proud and haught,\r\n         Renowning him for valorous and gent;\r\n               He took and holds me and with erring thought\r\n         To jealousy is bent;\r\n           Whence I, alack! nigh to despair am wrought,\r\n           As knowing myself,—brought\r\n           Into this world for good\r\n         Of many an one,—engrossed of one sole mate.\r\n\r\n         The luckless hour I curse, in very deed,\r\n           When I, alas! said yea,\r\n         Vesture to change,—so fair in that dusk wede\r\n         I was and glad, whereas in this more gay\r\n         A weary life I lead,\r\n           Far less than erst held honest, welaway!\r\n         Ah, dolorous bridal day,\r\n               Would God I had been dead\r\n         Or e’er I proved thee in such ill estate!\r\n         O lover dear, with whom well pleased was I\r\n           Whilere past all that be,—\r\n         Who now before Him sittest in the sky\r\n         Who fashioned us,—have pity upon me\r\n         Who cannot, though I die,\r\n           Forget thee for another; cause me see\r\n           The flame that kindled thee\r\n           For me lives yet unquenched\r\n         And my recall up thither impetrate.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fourth day Filostrato sang:\r\n\r\n                    Weeping, I demonstrate\r\n          How sore with reason doth my heart complain\r\n          Of love betrayed and plighted faith in vain.\r\n          Love, whenas first there was of thee imprest\r\n                Thereon her image for whose sake I sigh,\r\n                  Sans hope of succour aye,\r\n                  So full of virtue didst thou her pourtray,\r\n          That every torment light accounted I\r\n          That through thee to my breast,\r\n          Grown full of drear unrest\r\n          And dole, might come; but now, alack! I’m fain\r\n          To own my error, not withouten pain.\r\n          Yea, of the cheat first was I made aware,\r\n            Seeing myself of her forsaken sheer,\r\n            In whom I hoped alone;\r\n            For, when I deemed myself most fairly grown\r\n            Into her favor and her servant dear,\r\n          Without her thought or care\r\n          Of my to-come despair,\r\n          I found she had another’s merit ta’en\r\n          To heart and put me from her with disdain.\r\n\r\n          Whenas I knew me banished from my stead,\r\n          Straight in my heart a dolorous plaint there grew,\r\n                That yet therein hath power,\r\n                And oft I curse the day and eke the hour\r\n          When first her lovesome visage met my view,\r\n          Graced with high goodlihead;\r\n          And more enamoured\r\n          Than eye, my soul keeps up its dying strain,\r\n          Faith, ardor, hope, blaspheming still amain.\r\n          How void my misery is of all relief\r\n            Thou may’st e’en feel, so sore I call thee, sire,\r\n                With voice all full of woe;\r\n              Ay, and I tell thee that it irks me so\r\n                That death for lesser torment I desire.\r\n                Come, death, then; sheer the sheaf\r\n                Of this my life of grief\r\n          And with thy stroke my madness eke assain;\r\n          Go where I may, less dire will be my bane.\r\n\r\n          No other way than death is left my spright,\r\n            Ay, and none other solace for my dole;\r\n            Then give it me straightway,\r\n            Love; put an end withal to my dismay;\r\n          Ah, do it; since fate’s spite\r\n          Hath robbed me of delight;\r\n          Gladden thou her, lord, with my death, love-slain,\r\n          As thou hast cheered her with another swain.\r\n\r\n          My song, though none to learn thee lend an ear,\r\n          I reck the less thereof, indeed, that none\r\n            Could sing thee even as I;\r\n            One only charge I give thee, ere I die,\r\n            That thou find love and unto him alone\r\n          Show fully how undear\r\n          This bitter life and drear\r\n                Is to me, craving of his might he deign\r\n          Some better harborage I may attain.\r\n                Weeping I demonstrate\r\n          How sore with reason doth my heart complain\r\n          Of love betrayed and plighted faith in vain.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the last story on the seventh day Filomena sings:\r\n\r\n           Alack, my life forlorn!\r\n               Will’t ever chance I may once more regain\r\n           Th’estate whence sorry fortune hath me torn?\r\n           Certes, I know not, such a wish of fire\r\n               I carry in my thought\r\n               To find me where, alas!

Short be the stay\r\n             until thou come, and long mayst thou remain!\r\n           I’m so love-struck, I reck not of men’s scorn.\r\n           If once again I chance to hold thee aye,\r\n             I will not be so fond\r\n             As erst I was to suffer thee to fly;\r\n           Nay, fast I’ll hold thee, hap of it what may,\r\n             And having thee in bond,\r\n             Of thy sweet mouth by lust I’ll satisfy.\r\n             Now of nought else will I\r\n           Discourse. Quick, to thy bosom come me strain;\r\n           The sheer thought bids me sing like lark at morn.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRabelais (1490–1553), in his _Gargantua and Pantagruel_, incorporates\r\ninto his fantastic and satirical novel contemporary views and personal\r\nattitudes on a large variety of subjects—religious and cosmological,\r\nliterary, metaphysical, and theological. Among the topics and\r\ndiscussions propounded by some of his odd characters is the problem of\r\namatory stimuli:\r\n\r\n    When I say, quoth Rondibilis, that wine abateth lust, my meaning\r\n    is, wine immoderately taken; for by intemperance proceeding from\r\n    the excessive drinking of strong liquor, there is brought upon\r\n    the body of such a swill-down bouser, a chilliness in the blood,\r\n    a slackening in the sinews, a dissipation of the generative\r\n    seed, a numbness and hebetation of the senses, with a perversive\r\n    wryness and convulsion of the muscles; all of which are great\r\n    lets and impediments to the act of generation. Hence it is, that\r\n    Bacchus, the god of bibbers, tipplers, and drunkards, is most\r\n    commonly painted beardless, and clad in a woman’s habit, as a\r\n    person altogether effeminate, or like a libbed eunuch. Wine,\r\n    nevertheless, taken moderately, worketh quite contrary effects,\r\n    as is implied by the old proverb, which saith,—That Venus takes\r\n    cold, when not accompanied with Ceres and Bacchus.\r\n\r\nOn another point in erotic investigations, Rabelais continues:\r\n\r\n    The fervency of Lust is abated by certain drugs, plants, herbs,\r\n    and roots, which make the taker cold, maleficiated, unfit for,\r\n    and unable to perform the act of generation; as hath been often\r\n    experimented in the water-lily, Heraclea, Agnus Castus,\r\n    willow-twigs, hemp-stalks, wood-bine, honey-suckle, tamarisk,\r\n    chaste-tree, mandrake, bennet, keck-bugloss, the skin of a\r\n    hippopotamus, and many other such, which, by convenient doses\r\n    proportioned to the peccant humor and constitution of the\r\n    patient, being duly and seasonably received within the body,\r\n    what by their elementary virtues on the one side, and peculiar\r\n    properties on the other,—do either benumb, mortify, and\r\n    beclumpse with cold the prolific semence, or scatter and\r\n    disperse the spirits, which ought to have gone along with, and\r\n    conducted sperm to the places destinated and appointed for its\r\n    reception,—or lastly, shut up, stop, and obstruct the ways,\r\n    passages, and conduits through which the seed should have been\r\n    expelled, evacuated, and ejected. We have nevertheless of those\r\n    ingredients, which, being of a contrary operation, heat the\r\n    blood, bend the nerves, unite the spirits, quicken the senses,\r\n    strengthen the muscles, and thereby rouse up, provoke, excite,\r\n    and enable a man to the vigorous accomplishment of the feat of\r\n    amorous dalliance.\r\n\r\nObstructions to such dalliance are now discussed:\r\n\r\n    The ardor of lechery is very much subdued and check’d by\r\n    frequent labor and continual toiling. For by painful exercises\r\n    and laborious working, so great a dissolution is brought upon\r\n    the whole body, that the blood, which runneth alongst the\r\n    channels of the veins thereof, for the nourishment and\r\n    alimentation of each of its members, hath neither time, leisure,\r\n    nor power to afford the seminal resudation, or superfluity of\r\n    the third concoction, which nature most carefully reserves for\r\n    the conservation of the individual, whose preservation she more\r\n    heedfully regardeth than the propagation of the species, and the\r\n    multiplication of human land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Metropolitan Museum of Art\r\n\r\n  EVE\r\n\r\n  _by Rodin_\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Metropolitan Museum of Art\r\n\r\n  ETERNAL SPRINGTIME\r\n\r\n  _by Rodin_\r\n]\r\n\r\n    On the other part, in opposition and repugnancy hereto, the\r\n    philosophers say, That idleness is the mother of luxury. When it\r\n    was asked Ovid, why Aegisthus became an adulterer? he made no\r\n    other answer but this, Because he was idle. Who were able to rid\r\n    the world of loitering and laziness might easily frustrate and\r\n    disappoint Cupid of all his designs, aims, engines, and devices,\r\n    and so disable and appal him that his bow, quiver, and darts\r\n    should from thenceforth be a mere needless load and burthen to\r\n    him, for that it could not lie in his power to strike, or wound\r\n    any of either sex, with all the arms he had.\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n    The tickling pricks of incontinency are blunted by an eager\r\n    study; for from thence proceedeth an incredible resolution of\r\n    the spirits, that oftentimes there do not remain so many behind\r\n    as may suffice to push and thrust forwards the generative\r\n    resudation to the places thereto appropriated, and there withal\r\n    inflate the cavernous nerve, whose office is to ejaculate the\r\n    moisture for the propagation of human progeny.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe English herbalist John Gerarde, who wrote a Herbal that was\r\npublished in 1633, suggests a stimulating drink composed of juniper\r\nberries steeped in water. The juniper shrub itself was used medicinally,\r\nin cordials, and as an element in philtres.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe medieval writer Andreas Cisalpinus states that the tree called\r\ngossypion produced a juice that aided amatory efforts.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEmblica honey was, in the opinion of the thirteenth century Arab\r\nphilosopher Avicenna, endowed with venereal virtues.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA plant that is native to both North and South Africa produces as an\r\nexudation a gum resin called euphorbium, which was considered in the\r\nthirteenth century an invigorating agent.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe medieval philosopher Albertus Magnus mentions a stone called\r\naquileus or echites, that is found near the Mediterranean littoral and\r\nin Persia, in eagles’ nests. This stone contains a smaller one that has\r\nan amatory character.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Babio_, a twelfth century Latin comedy, presents the priest Babio\r\nhimself apostrophizing women: Oh! What a guilty thing is a woman! The\r\nworst thing on earth. A seducer. There is no guile in the world that is\r\nmissing in her. There is no evil so wicked as a long sequence of evils.\r\nNobody considers the perils of a snake that has long been kept crushed.\r\nMy wife is a thief. My slave is my guard. It’s a case of trouble and\r\ntrickery. She is a she-wolf. He’s a lion. She holds me, while he fetters\r\nme. She casts me to the ground, he crushes me. She presses on me, he\r\nstrikes me. She kills me, he crunches me.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the medieval centuries the gum resin known as scammony, native to the\r\nMiddle East, was suggested as a stimulus when mixed with honey.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA medieval potion that had Oriental ingredients was the following\r\ncompound: Amber, aloes, musk, powdered together and soaked in spirits of\r\nwine. Heated in sand, then filtered, distilled, and hermetically sealed.\r\nThe prescription required from three to five drops, taken in a broth.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a number of twelfth century Latin comedies, particularly _De Nuntio\r\nSagaci_, The Wily Messenger, nubile age is presented as in itself a\r\nstrong amatory provocation. The messenger says.\r\n\r\n             Nubere tempus erat: iuveni tua forma placebat.\r\n\r\nThis was the theme of the medieval students, so vociferously and\r\nconsistently proclaimed in the Carmina Burana:\r\n\r\n                         Iam aetas invaluit,\r\n                         Iam umor incubuit,\r\n                         Iam virgo maturuit,\r\n                         Iam tumescunt ubera,\r\n                         Iam frustra complacuit\r\n                         Nisi fiant cetera.\r\n\r\nAgain, the same view is determinedly expressed:\r\n\r\n                       Si puer cum puellula,\r\n                       Moraretur in cellula,\r\n                       Felix coniunctio.\r\n                       Amore sucrescente,\r\n                       Pariter et medio\r\n                       Avulso procul taedio,\r\n                       Fit ludus ineffabilis\r\n                       Membris, lacertis, labiis.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Baucis et Traso_, a Latin comedy belonging in the twelfth century,\r\npresents the methods used in the Middle Ages for the amatory enticements\r\nof the male. These methods, however, have never differed in essence:\r\nwhether in the fifth century in Athens, in the second B.C. in Rome, or\r\nin contemporary days.\r\n\r\nBaucis, who knows where her interests lie, urged by the hope of gain,\r\nacts as a counsellor to the maiden Glycerium. She summons Glycerium,\r\nadorns her, pays her little attentions. She shapes the girl’s lips,\r\ndraws her cheeks down, skilfully refreshes her beauty, gives her a wide\r\nbrow, spreads out her hair in flowing tresses, makes her neck glow,\r\nmakes shoulders narrow, lengthens her nails, makes her hands look\r\nshorter. With a needle, she shapes her arms, puts a girdle on her to\r\nproduce an effect of slenderness. Baucis teaches her what she must do,\r\nhow, and with whom.\r\n\r\nAnd so Glycerium strolls up and down the streets, glances around, looks\r\nfor lovers. In some cases, she encourages hope by her words, just as she\r\nherself has confidence in her guile. She gives warnings, invitations,\r\nasks them to observe her beautiful eyes. She promises them affection,\r\ndelights, wine, food. They will have with this maiden conversation and\r\nintimacies, kisses and the final consummation itself.\r\n\r\nBaucis gives the girl imaginary names. Sometimes she is called\r\nGlycerium, and again Philomena, as the whim takes her. By means of such\r\nchanges of name she multiplies her gains.\r\n\r\nLovers come flocking in rivalry, some searching for Glycerium, others\r\nfor Philomena.\r\n\r\nWhile she regales the young men with her words, while she gives them a\r\nvain hope and meanwhile acquires monies, Thraso comes upon her.\r\n\r\nThraso’s glory is drink. His stomach is his god. Venus is his ever-ready\r\ncompanion. Baucis catches sight of him and, overjoyed, she approaches:\r\n\r\n    Baucis: O soldier, nurseling of Cupid, love’s honor, what is it\r\n    you desire? Where are you off to? What fires inflame you? If you\r\n    need a maiden, I have one at home. A flower, the true fruit of\r\n    love. She has a maidenly glow, she shines with every adornment\r\n    of beauty.\r\n\r\n    Thraso: Baucis, let me see her.\r\n\r\n    Baucis: She is asleep and I can’t waken her. She is delicate and\r\n    a delicate girl needs much sleep. If she stays awake too long,\r\n    she is sick. If she sleeps badly, she suffers.\r\n\r\nThraso burns up with restrained passion. He groans and pleads. He gives\r\nhis gold ring to Baucis. Baucis relents. He buys provisions at the\r\nmarket and follows her home.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Baucis vanishes. All her talk, all her manoeuvers have been\r\ndesigned merely to tantalize his libidinous urgencies, to bring him\r\nsuppliantly into her clutches. Thraso is left lamenting:\r\n\r\n    Thraso: O woman, noxious flame, gnawing wound, enemy to\r\n    friendship. Woman, the sum of evil. Woman, deserving of death.\r\n    Woman, who produces the seeds of putrefaction, who produces\r\n    death. Foul procuress, monstrous in appearance, the image of the\r\n    Chimera.\r\n\r\nLater on, Thraso approaches Glycerium herself, but she refuses his\r\nadvances. She is too young and inexperienced, she pleads:\r\n\r\n           Sum rudis in Venerem nec adhuc mea nubilis aetas:\r\n             Intemerata manet dos mea virginea.\r\n           Non novi quid amor, quid amoris sentiat ictus.\r\n             Officium Veneris horreo, siste preces.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Jay Fletchers play _The Wild-Goose Chase_, there is mention of amber,\r\na reputed amatory provocative. Mirabel, one of the leading characters,\r\nis offering a portrait of women:\r\n\r\n     Mirabel: Only the wenches are not for my diet;\r\n       They are too lean and thin, their embraces brawn-fallen.\r\n       Give me the plump Venetian, fat and lusty,\r\n       That meets me soft and supple; smiles upon me,\r\n       As if a cup of full wine leap’d to kiss me,\r\n       These slight things I affect not.\r\n\r\n     Pinac: They are ill-built;\r\n       Pin-buttocked, like your dainty Barbaries,\r\n       And weak i’ the pasterns; they’ll endure no hardness.\r\n\r\n     Mirabel: There’s nothing good or handsome bred amongst us;\r\n       Till we are travell’d, and live abroad, we are coxcombs.\r\n       Ye talk of France—a slight unseason’d country,\r\n       Abundance of gross food, which makes us blockheads.\r\n       We are fair set out indeed, and so are fore-horses:—\r\n       Men say, we are great courtiers,—men abuse us;\r\n       We are wise, and valiant too,—non credo, signor;\r\n       Our women the best linguists,—they are parrots;\r\n       O’ this side the Alps they are nothing but mere drolleries.\r\n       Ha! Roma la Santa, Italy for my money!\r\n       Their policies, their customs, their frugalities,\r\n       Their courtesies so open, yet so reserv’d too,\r\n       As, when you think y’are known best, ye are a stranger.\r\n       Their very pick-teeth speak more than we do.\r\n       And season of more salt.\r\n\r\n     Pinac: ’Tis a brave country;\r\n       Not pester’d with your stubborn precise puppies,\r\n       That turn all useful and allow’d contentments\r\n       To scabs and scruples—hang ’em, capon-worshippers.\r\n\r\n     Belleur: I like that freedom well, and like their women too,\r\n       And would fain do as others do; but I am so bashful,\r\n       So naturally an ass! Look ye, I can look upon ’em,\r\n       And very willingly I go to see ’em,\r\n       (There’s no man willinger), and I can kiss ’em,\r\n       And make a shift—\r\n\r\n     Mirabel: But, if they chance to flout ye,\r\n       Or say, “Ye are too bold! Fie, sir, remember!\r\n       I pray, sit farther off—”\r\n\r\n     Belleur:’Tis true—I am humbled,\r\n       I am gone; I confess ingenuously, I am silenced;\r\n       The spirit of amber cannot force me answer.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Ben Jonson’s _The Alchemist_, there is reference to a means of\r\nsecuring amatory and rejuvenating capacity. Sir Epicure Mammon tries to\r\nimpose his alchemical beliefs on Surly:\r\n\r\n       Mammon: I assure you,\r\n         He that has once the flower of the sun,\r\n         The perfect ruby, which we call elixir,\r\n         Not only can do that, but by its virtue,\r\n         Can confer honor, love, respect, long life;\r\n         Give safety, valor, yea, and victory,\r\n         To whom he will. In eight and twenty days,\r\n         I’ll make an old man of fourscore, a child.\r\n\r\n       Surly: No doubt; he’s that already.\r\n\r\n       Mammon: Nay, I mean,\r\n         Restore his years, renew him, like an eagle,\r\n         To the fifth age; make him get sons and daughters,\r\n         Young giants; as our philosophers have done,\r\n         The ancient patriarchs, afore the flood,\r\n         But taking, once a week, on a knife’s point,\r\n         The quantity of a grain of mustard of it;\r\n         Become stout Marses, and beget young Cupids.\r\n\r\n       Surly: The decay’d vestals of Pickt-hatch would thank you,\r\n         That keep the fire alive there.\r\n\r\n       Mammon: ’Tis the secret\r\n         Of nature naturiz’d ’gainst all infections,\r\n         Cures all diseases coming of all causes;\r\n         A month’s grief in a day, a year’s in twelve;\r\n         And, of what age soever, in a month.\r\n         Past all the doses of your drugging doctors.\r\n         I’ll undertake, withal, to fright the plague\r\n         Out o’ the kingdom in three months.\r\n\r\n       Surly: And I’ll\r\n         Be bound, the players shall sing your praises then,\r\n         Without their poets.\r\n\r\n       Mammon: Sir, I’ll do it. Meantime,\r\n         I’ll give away so much unto my man,\r\n         Shall serve th’ whole city with preservative\r\n         weekly; each house his dose, and at the rate—\r\n\r\n       Surly: As he that built the Water-work does with water?\r\n\r\n       Mammon: You are incredulous.\r\n\r\n       Surly: Faith, I have a humor,\r\n         I would not willingly be gull’d. Your stone\r\n         Cannot transmute me.\r\n\r\n       Mammon: Pertinax Surly,\r\n         Will you believe antiquity? Records?\r\n         I’ll show you a book where Moses, and his sister,\r\n         And Solomon have written of the art;\r\n         Ay, and a treatise penn’d by Adam—\r\n\r\n       Surly: How!\r\n\r\n       Mammon: Of the philosopher’s stone, and in High Dutch.\r\n\r\n       Surly: Did Adam write, sir, in High Dutch?\r\n\r\n       Mammon: He did;\r\n         Which proves it was the primitive tongue.\r\n\r\n       Surly: What paper?\r\n\r\n       Mammon: On cedar board.\r\n\r\n       Surly: O that, indeed, they say,\r\n         Will last ’gainst worms.\r\n\r\n       Mammon: ’Tis like your English wood\r\n         ’Gainst cobwebs. I have a piece of Jason’s fleece too,\r\n         which was no other than a book of alchemy,\r\n         Writ in large sheepskin, a good fat ram-vellum.\r\n         Such was Pythagoras’ thigh, Pandora’s tub,\r\n         And all that fable of Medea’s charms,\r\n         The manner of our work; the bulls, our furnace,\r\n         Still breathing fire; our argent-vive, the dragon:\r\n         The dragon’s teeth, mercury sublimate,\r\n         That keeps the whiteness, hardness, and the biting;\r\n         And they are gather’d into Jason’s helm,\r\n         Th’alembic, and then sow’d in Mars his field.\r\n         And thence sublim’d so often, that they’re fix’d.\r\n         Both this, th’ Hesperian garden, Cadmus’ story,\r\n         Jove’s shower, the boom of Midas, Argus’ eyes,\r\n         Boccace his Demogorgon, thousands more,\r\n         All abstract riddles of our stone.—How now!\r\n\r\nIn another scene, amatory potency is expressed in lavish rhetorical\r\nimagery:\r\n\r\n         Mammon: Do we succeed? Is our day come? And holds it?\r\n\r\n         Face: The evening will set red upon you, sir;\r\n           You have color for it, crimson: the red ferment\r\n           Has done his office; three hours hence prepare you\r\n           To see projection.\r\n\r\n         Mammon: Pertinax, my Surly,\r\n           Again I say to thee, aloud, BE RICH.\r\n           This day thou shalt have ingots; and tomorrow\r\n           Give lords th’affront.—Is it, my Zephyrus, right?\r\n           Blushes the bolt’s-head?\r\n\r\n         Face: Like a wench with child, sir,\r\n           That were but now discover’d to her master.\r\n\r\n         Mammon: Excellent witty Lungs!—My only care is\r\n           Where to get stuff enough now, to project on;\r\n           This town will not half serve me.\r\n\r\n         Face: No, sir? Buy the covering off o’ churches.\r\n\r\n         Mammon: That’s true.\r\n\r\n         Face: Yes.\r\n           Let ’em stand bare, as do their auditory;\r\n           Or cap ’em new with shingles.\r\n\r\n         Mammon: No, good thatch:\r\n           Thatch will lie upo’ the rafters, Lungs.\r\n           Lungs, I will manumit thee from the furnace;\r\n           I will restore thee thy complexion, Puff,\r\n           Lost in the embers; and repair this brain,\r\n           Hurt wi’ the fumes o’ the metals.\r\n\r\n         Face: I have blown, sir,\r\n           Hard, for your worship; thrown by many a coal,\r\n           When ’twas not beech; weigh’d those I put in, just\r\n           To keep your heat still even. These blear’d eyes\r\n           Have wak’d to read your several colors, sir,\r\n           Of the pale citron, the green lion, the crow,\r\n           The peacock’s tail, the plumed swan.\r\n\r\n         Mammon: And lastly,\r\n           Thou hast descried the flower, the sanguis agni?\r\n\r\n         Face: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n         Mammon: Where’s master?\r\n\r\n         Face: At’s prayers, sir, he;\r\n           Good man, he’s doing his devotions\r\n           For the success.\r\n\r\n         Mammon: Lungs, I will set a period\r\n           To all thy labors; thou shalt be the master\r\n           Of my seraglio.\r\n\r\n         Face: Good, sir.\r\n\r\n         Mammon: But do you hear?\r\n           I’ll geld you, Lungs.\r\n\r\n         Face: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n         Mammon: For I do mean\r\n           To have a list of wives and concubines\r\n           Equal with Solomon, who had the stone\r\n           Alike with me; and I will make me a back\r\n           with the elixir, that shall be as tough\r\n           As Hercules, to encounter fifty a night.—\r\n           Thou’rt sure thou saw’st it blood?\r\n\r\n         Face: Both blood and spirit, sir.\r\n\r\n         Mammon: I will have all my beds blown up, not stuft;\r\n           Down is too hard: and then, mine oval room\r\n           Fill’d with such pictures as Tiberius took\r\n           From Elephantis, and dull Aretine\r\n           But coldly imitated. Then, my glasses\r\n           Cut in more subtle angles, to disperse\r\n           And multiply the figures, as I walk\r\n           Named between my succubae. My mists\r\n           I’ll have of perfume, vapor’d ’bout the room,\r\n           To lose ourselves in; and my baths, like pits\r\n           To fall into; from whence we will come forth,\r\n           And roll us dry in gossamer and roses.—\r\n           Is it arrived at ruby?—Where I spy\r\n           A wealthy citizen, or a rich lawyer,\r\n           Have a sublim’d pure wife, unto that fellow\r\n           I’ll send a thousand pound to be my cuckold.\r\n\r\n         Face: And I shall carry it?\r\n\r\n         Mammon: No, I’ll ha’ no bawds\r\n           But fathers and mothers: they will do it best,\r\n           Best of all others. And my flatterers\r\n           Shall be the pure and gravest of divines,\r\n           That I can get for money. My mere fools,\r\n           Eloquent burgesses, and then my poets,\r\n           Whom I shall entertain still for that subject.\r\n           The few that would give out themselves to be\r\n           Court and town-stallions, and, each-where, bely\r\n           Ladies who are known most innocent, for them,—\r\n           Those will I beg, to make me eunuchs of:\r\n           And they shall fan me with ten ostrich tails\r\n           A-piece, made in a plume to gather wind.\r\n           We will be brave, Puff, now we ha’ the med’cine,\r\n           My meat shall all come in, in Indian shells,\r\n           Dishes of agate set in gold, and studded\r\n           with emeralds, sapphires, hyacinths, and rubies.\r\n           The tongues of carps, dormies, and camels’ heels,\r\n           Boil’d i’ the spirit of sol, and dissolv’d pearl\r\n           (Apicius’ diet, ’gainst the epilepsy):\r\n           And I will eat these broths with spoons of amber,\r\n           Headed with diamond and carbuncle.\r\n           My foot-boy shall eat pheasants, calver’d salmons,\r\n           Knots, godwits, lampreys: I myself will have\r\n           The beards of barbel serv’d, instead of salads;\r\n           Oil’d mushrooms; and the swelling unctuous paps\r\n           Of a fat pregnant sow, newly cut off,\r\n           Drest with an exquisite and poignant sauce;\r\n           For which, I’ll say unto my cook, There’s gold;\r\n           Go forth, and be a knight.\r\n\r\n         Face: Sir, I’ll go look\r\n           A little, how it heightens. (Exit)\r\n\r\n         Mammon: Do.—My shirts\r\n           I’ll have of taffeta-sarsnet, soft and light\r\n           As cobwebs; and for all my other raiment,\r\n           It shall be such as might provoke the Persian,\r\n           Were he to teach the world riot anew.\r\n           My gloves of fishes and birds’ skins, perfum’d\r\n           With gums of paradise, and Eastern air—\r\n\r\n         Surly: And do you think to have the stone with this?\r\n\r\n         Mammon: No, I do think t’have all this with the stone.\r\n\r\n         Surly: Why, I have heard he must be homo frugi,\r\n           A pious, holy, and religious man,\r\n           One free from mortal sin, a very virgin.\r\n\r\n         Mammon: That makes it, sir; he is so. But I buy it;\r\n           My venture brings it me. He, honest wretch,\r\n           A notable, superstitious, good soul,\r\n           Has worn his knees bare, and his slippers bald,\r\n           With prayer and fasting for it: and, sir, let him\r\n           Do it alone, for me, still. Here he comes,\r\n           Not a profane word afore him; ’tis poison.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the same play, there is an enumeration of alchemical items,\r\nmany of which were, both in ancient and in medieval times, used in\r\namatory brews:\r\n\r\n       Subtle: Sir?\r\n\r\n       Surly: What else are all your terms,\r\n         Whereon no one o’ your writers ’grees with other?\r\n         Of your elixir, your lac virginis,\r\n         Your stone, your med’cine, and your chrysosperm,\r\n         Your sal, your sulphur, and your mercury,\r\n         Your oil of height, your tree of life, your blood,\r\n         Your marchesite, your tutie, your magnesia,\r\n         Your toad, your crow, your dragon, and your panther;\r\n         Your sun, your moon, your firmament, your adrop,\r\n         Your lato, azoch, zernich, chilbrit, beautarit,\r\n         And then your red man, and your white woman,\r\n         With all your broths, your menstrues, and materials\r\n         Of piss and egg-shells, women’s terms, man’s blood,\r\n         Hair o’ the head, burnt clouts, chalk, merds, and clay,\r\n         Powder of bones, scalings of iron, glass,\r\n         And worlds of other strange ingredients,\r\n         Would burst a man to name?\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA number of herbs, some of which were reputed to produce amatory\r\nbenefits, are mentioned in Ben Jonson’s _Volpone_:\r\n\r\n   Lady Politic Would-Be: Alas, good soul! the passion of the heart.\r\n     Seed-Pearl were good now, boil’d with syrup of apples,\r\n     Tincture of gold, and coral, citron-pills,\r\n     Your elecampane root, myrobalances—\r\n\r\n   Volpone: Ay me, I have ta’en a grasshopper by the wing!\r\n\r\n   Lady Politic Would-Be: Burnt silk and amber. You have muscadel\r\n     Good i’ the house—\r\n\r\n   Volpone: You will not drink, and part?\r\n\r\n   Lady Politic Would-Be: No, fear not that. I doubt we shall not get\r\n     Some English saffron, half a dram would serve;\r\n     Your sixteen cloves, a little musk, dried mints;\r\n     Bugloss and barley-meal—\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Ben Jonson’s _Volpone_ Nano the Dwarf sings some verses, in Act 2,\r\nscene 2, extolling an elixir that has remarkable medicinal and amatory\r\nproperties:\r\n\r\n                You that would last long, list to my song,\r\n                Make no more coil, but buy of this oil.\r\n                Would you be ever fair and young?\r\n                Stout of teeth, and strong of tongue?\r\n                Tart of palate? quick of ear?\r\n                Sharp of sight? of nostril clear?\r\n                Moist of hand? and light of foot?\r\n                Or, I will come nearer to ’t,\r\n                Would you live free from all diseases?\r\n                Do the act your mistress pleases,\r\n                Yet fright all aches from your bones?\r\n                Here’s a med’cine for the nones.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn amatory appeal is made in a scene from _Bussy D’Ambois_, a drama by\r\nthe English playwright George Chapman (c. 1559–c. 1634). Monsieur,\r\nbrother of King Henry III of France, addresses the Countess Tamyra:\r\n\r\n      Monsieur: And wherefore do you this? To please your husband?\r\n        ’Tis gross and fulsome: if your husband’s pleasure\r\n        Be all your object, and you aim at honor\r\n        In living close to him, get you from Court;\r\n        You may have him at home; these common put-offs\r\n        For common women serve: “My honor! Husband!”\r\n        Dames maritorious ne’er were meritorious.\r\n        Speak plain, and say, “I do not like you, sir,\r\n        Y’are an ill-favor’d fellow in my eye;”\r\n        And I am answer’d.\r\n\r\n      Tamyra: Then, I pray, be answer’d:\r\n        For in good faith, my lord, I do not like you\r\n        In that sort you like.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe love charm in the form of a spell was a belief current in the\r\nElizabethan age. In the drama _Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay_, by Robert\r\nGreene, Bacon, conceived as a thaumaturgist, declares:\r\n\r\n             Thou com’st in post from merry Fressingfield,\r\n             Fast-fancied to the Keeper’s bonny lass.\r\n\r\nFast-fancied is an Elizabethan expression meaning bound by love.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Elizabethan Fair, and all such traditional occasions for barter,\r\ncommercial interchange, and public gossip were also and always an\r\nopportunity for amorous interludes. This is the view expressed in _Friar\r\nBacon and Friar Bungay_, by Robert Greene (c. 1560–1592). Margaret, the\r\nfair maid of Fressingfield, enters:\r\n\r\n         Margaret: Thomas, maids when they come to see the fair\r\n           Count not to make a cope for dearth of hay;\r\n           When we have turn’d our butter to the salt,\r\n           And set our cheese safely upon the racks,\r\n           Then let our fathers price it as they please.\r\n           We country sluts of merry Fressingfield\r\n           Come to buy needless naughts to make us fine,\r\n           And look that young men should be frank this day,\r\n           And court us with such fairings as they can.\r\n           Phoebus is blithe, and frolic looks from heaven.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a scene from the Elizabethan dramatist George Peele’s _The Old Wives\r\nTale_, Zantippa is in search of a husband. She and her ugly sister\r\nCelanta go to a well for water. A Head, speaking from the well, promises\r\nher a love charm, ‘some cockell-bread’:\r\n\r\n    Zantippa: Now for a husband, house, and home: God send a good\r\n    one or none, I pray God! My father hath sent me to the well for\r\n    the water of life, and tells me, if I give fair words, I shall\r\n    have a husband. But here comes Celanta, my sweet sister. I’ll\r\n    stand by and hear what she says.\r\n\r\n    Enter Celanta, the foul wench, to the well for water with a pot\r\n    in her hand.\r\n\r\nCelanta: My father hath sent me to the well for water, and he tells me,\r\nif I speak fair, I shall have a husband and none of the worst. Well,\r\nthough I am black, I am sure all the world will not forsake me; and, as\r\nthe old proverb is, though I am black, I am not the devil.\r\n\r\nZantippa: Marry-gup with a murrain. I know wherefore thou speakest that:\r\nbut go thy ways home as wise as thou camest, or I’ll set thee home with\r\na wanion.\r\n\r\n    Here she strikes her pitcher against her sister’s, and breaks\r\n    them both, and then exit.\r\n\r\nCelanta: I think this be the curstest quean in the world. You see what\r\nshe is, a little fair, but as proud as the devil, and the veriest vixen\r\nthat lives upon God’s earth. Well, I’ll let her alone, and go home and\r\nget another pitcher, and, for all this, get me to the well for water.\r\nExit.\r\n\r\n    Enter two Furies out of the Conjurer’s cell and lay Huanebango\r\n    by the Well of Life and then exeunt.\r\n\r\n    Re-enter Zantippa with a pitcher to the well.\r\n\r\nZantippa: Once again for a husband; and, in faith, Celanta, I have got\r\nthe start of you; belike husbands grow by the well-side. Now my father\r\nsays I must rule my tongue. Why, alas, what am I, then? A woman without\r\na tongue is as a soldier without his weapon. But I’ll have my water, and\r\nbe gone.\r\n\r\n    Here she offers to dip her pitcher in, and a Head speaks in the\r\n    well.\r\n\r\n             Head: Gently dip, but not too deep,\r\n               For fear you make the golden beard to weep.\r\n               Fair maiden, white and red,\r\n               Stroke me smooth, and comb my head,\r\n               And thou shalt have some cockell-bread.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn an old Elizabethan play there is reference to lunary or moonwort as a\r\ncontributory factor in amatory thoughts:\r\n\r\n    I have heard of an herb called Lunary that being bound to the\r\n    pulse of the sick causes nothing but dreams of weddings and\r\n    dances.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn _Endymion_, a drama by the Elizabethan playwright John Lyly (c.\r\n1554–c. 1606), Endymion soliloquizes:\r\n\r\n    As ebony, which no fire can scorch, is yet consumed with sweet\r\n    savors, so my heart which cannot be bent by the hardness of\r\n    fortune, may be bruised by amorous desires.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the drama _The Old Wives Tale_, by George Peele, the Elizabethan\r\nplaywright, Frolic and Fantastic sing an erotic chant:\r\n\r\n               Whenas the rye reach to the chin,\r\n               And chopcherry, chopcherry ripe within,\r\n               Strawberries swimming in the cream,\r\n               And school-boys playing in the stream;\r\n               Then, O then, O then, O my true-love said,\r\n               Till that time come again\r\n               She could not live a maid.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn _Endymion_, the Elizabethan drama by John Lyly, Sir Tophas describes\r\na desirable woman:\r\n\r\n    Sir Tophas: I love no grissels; they are so brittle they will\r\n    crack like glass, or so dainty that if they be touched they are\r\n    straight of the fashion of wax: animus maioribus instat.

For Heaven’s sake, what are you then?\r\n        Or what shall I be, sir?\r\n\r\n      Overreach: Stand not on form;\r\n        Words are no substances.\r\n\r\n      Margaret: Though you could dispense\r\n        With your own honor, cast aside religion,\r\n        The hopes of Heaven, or fear of hell, excuse me,\r\n        In worldly policy this is not the way\r\n        To make me his wife; his whore, I grant it may do.\r\n        My maiden honor so soon yielded up,\r\n        Nay, prostituted, cannot but assure him\r\n        I, that am light to him, will not hold weight\r\n        Whene’er tempted by others; so, in judgment,\r\n        When to his lust I have given up my honor,\r\n        He must and will forsake me.\r\n\r\n      Overreach: How! I forsake thee!\r\n        Do I wear a sword for fashion? or is this arm\r\n        Shrunk up or wither’d? Does there live a man\r\n        Of that large list I have encounter’d with\r\n        Can truly say I e’er gave inch of ground\r\n        Not purchas’d with his blood that did oppose me?\r\n        Forsake thee when the thing is done! He dares not.\r\n        Give me but proof he has enjoy’d thy person,\r\n        Though all his captains, echoes to his will,\r\n        Stood arm’d by his side to justify the wrong,\r\n        And he himself in the head of his bold troop,\r\n        Spite of his lordship, and his colonelship,\r\n        Or the judge’s favor, I will make him render\r\n        A bloody and a strict account, and force him,\r\n        By marrying thee, to cure thy wounded honor!\r\n        I have said it.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs late as the eighteenth century, in Italy, phallic amulets, in the\r\nform of the fascinum itself and the obscene digital gesture called in\r\nFrench _la figue_, were in common use. They were worn by children as\r\nprotective periapts. Chapels too were decorated with wax images of\r\nphalli, dedicated by devout women worshippers.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn esoteric club existed in England in the eighteenth century that was\r\nassociated with the British Navy. It was called _The Very Ancient and\r\nVery Powerful Order of Beggars Benison and Merryland_. On the seal of\r\nthis Society, among other and naval designs, was a phallic symbol. The\r\nintent of the Society is still obscure, especially the relation between\r\nnaval matters and the phallus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmulets in the form of the male mandrake came into vogue in the Middle\r\nAges, especially in Central Europe, for apotropaic and amatory purposes.\r\nThese charms were associated with incantations and magic formulas and\r\nrecitatives.\r\n\r\nThe phallus or fascinum, too, especially in France, was used, as a\r\nmeaningful protective agent, on buildings and even on churches.\r\n\r\nPhallic and other genital forms were also used for cakes and breads: and\r\nare still so used, especially in Germany and France.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages Priapus assumed Christian characteristics and in time\r\nwas even endowed with sanctity, although he still retained his\r\nfunctional properties. In many cities of Southern France, for instance,\r\nSaint Foutin was virtually a transferred Priapus. He aided sterile women\r\nand renewed the amatory vigor of men. Images of genitalia were included\r\namong the sacrificial objects dedicated to this saint.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn medieval France a certain Saint Greluchon was a cryptic Priapus,\r\nvenerated among the members of the saintly canon. When women made\r\nsupplication to this saint, they scraped off minute particles from the\r\nstone genitalia and compounded these scrapings into an amatory potion,\r\nand also as an aid to counteract sterility.\r\n\r\nOther saints to whom were attributed the virtues and functions of\r\nPriapus were: Saint Guignolet, Saint Regnaud, Saint Gilles.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium, Priapus became Ters, equally venerated by women. Ters, in\r\nAntwerp, was actually a synonym for fascinum.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the gods of Northern Europe was Frikko, who may be equated with\r\nPriapus, the phallic deity. The Saxons had a similar god, called Frisco,\r\nendowed with the same functions. An analogous deity was Frigga, goddess\r\nof voluptuousness. Before the worship of this symbolic or actual phallus\r\nwas the worship of the sun, represented by the phallus as the creator of\r\ncosmic and human fecundity.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Clauder_\r\n\r\nA German medieval scholar presented for his doctoral thesis a brief\r\nmonograph on Philtres, their essential characteristics, the dangers\r\ninvolved in their use, the contents, the purpose of their employment.\r\nThe thesis, in Latin, is entitled De Philtris, and was published in\r\nLeipzig in 1661. The author is Johannes Clauder.\r\n\r\nAlthough philtres were frequently used for erotic purposes, the author\r\nasserts, the result rarely corresponded to the intention. The reason for\r\nthis was that the philtre was concocted under evil auspices, without\r\nappeal to divine aid and protection. Another reason for the inefficacy\r\nof the potions was improper and defective preparation. The result, he\r\ndeclares categorically, was very often madness for the victim, or even\r\ndeath itself.\r\n\r\nSome philtres are associated with Satanic and magic practices, and are\r\nessentially poisons. Whores and panders resort to such philtres,\r\nalthough some use what might be termed natural remedies.\r\n\r\nThe best philtre, however, according to Clauder, is love itself. In this\r\nregard, he quotes confirmatory statements from the Romans. Seneca the\r\nphilosopher, in one of his 124 Epistles, advises: I shall show you a\r\nlove philtre, without medicaments, without herbs, without a witch’s\r\nincantations. It is this: If you want to be loved, love. Martial, the\r\nRoman epigrammatist, has something similar to say: Marcus, in order to\r\nbe loved, love.\r\n\r\nAnd Ovid had already advised: Banish every evil, be lovable, in order to\r\nbe loved.\r\n\r\nParacelsus, the medieval scholar and alchemist, is quoted in relation to\r\nthe philtre and its content. Or, as Clauder suggests, the amatory\r\ninducement may take the form of a magic inscription on a key, or a ring,\r\nor a necklace, or an armlet. As for herbs, the Romans preferred the\r\nlaurel and the olive, in infusions. Vegetable and mineral and organic\r\nmatter is also in use; perspiration, urine, spittle. But there is a\r\nsinister and hazardous element in such practices. Prostitutes in\r\nparticular, Clauder threatens, use philtres that rob the victim of mind\r\nand soul and leave him a shallow husk. So corroborates Paracelsus. There\r\nis one potion, however, called Charisia, that may be innocuous. It has\r\nnot been identified. But possibly the name may have been invented\r\netymologically on the basis of the Greek _charis_, which means grace or\r\ngratitude: and hence the nomenclature is wishfully proleptic in\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\nWith respect to a variety of lustful and amatory circumstances, the\r\nMiddle Ages were marked by strange social mores, by monstrous\r\nobscenities and erotic barbarities. There were practices designed\r\nprimarily to preserve chastity and marital and domestic purity, but they\r\nactually resulted in greater indecencies than the circumstances that\r\ninduced these inventive prophylaxes. There was, first of all, the girdle\r\nof chastity, a mechanical device to prevent indiscriminate and unlawful\r\nlustful consummations in the absence of the husband. The putative\r\ninventor of the device was Francesco da Carrara, Provost of Padua, who\r\nbelongs in the latter part of the fourteenth century. He himself, it was\r\nsaid, met with a miserable death, being strangled on the scaffold for\r\nhis many cruelties, in 1405, by order of the Senate of Venice.\r\n\r\nThere was, too, the Congress, a kind of judicial body that determined\r\nmarital questions, quarrels, incompatibility, by viewing the two\r\nparticipants _in actu sexuali_.\r\n\r\nMen and women taken in adultery were compelled to march through the\r\npublic streets naked, sometimes mounted on an ass, for centuries the\r\nbestial symbol of lust.\r\n\r\nThere was the libidinous _ius primae noctis_, the _droit de cuisse_,\r\nexercised by the lord of the manor, and on occasion by monks and\r\nprelates, in the case of a newly wedded couple.\r\n\r\nIn France, in the city of Toulouse, there was a notorious brothel called\r\nThe Great Abbey. There were, dispersed through France, many such\r\npseudo-abbeys, the madame of which, in each case, was called Abbess.\r\nSuch terms and such practices, of course, heightened the lewd obscenity.\r\nThere was a similar type of dissolute haven that had an infamous\r\nreputation in England.\r\n\r\nThis perversion, in which devout elements are linked with the extremes\r\nof lust, to heighten the amatory impulse, is described in abundant and\r\nsalacious detail in the novels of the Marquis de Sade and in other\r\ninstances of erotic literature.\r\n\r\nProstitution reached such a social importance, and the practitioners\r\nacquired such influence in various directions, that, in Paris, a kind of\r\ntrade union was formed, to which the practicing prostitutes prescribed.\r\nThey established their own procedures, their working hours, and similar\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nAt many royal banquets, public entertainments, and processional\r\nceremonials, in Italy and in France, prostitutes were prominent\r\nparticipants, some half-naked, often entirely so.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, fulminations against such and similar\r\nindecencies, but without much immediate or effective results. Preachers\r\nthundered, to no avail, against the erotic provocations to adultery and\r\nfornication engendered by the sight of women who, by the subtlety of\r\ntheir dress, exposed various parts of their person. There was public\r\ndebauchery. There were genesiac performances in the presence of the\r\nchildren in a household. There were poems and tales, called fabliaux,\r\nthat, reflecting the mores of the age, dealt with nothing but cuckoldry\r\nand fornication, adultery, sodomy, bestiality, and all the multiple\r\nvarieties of physiological perversions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, houses, manors, large estates were decorated with\r\ntapestries, paintings, sculpture, all depicting the greatest\r\nobscenities. Even churches and chapels and abbeys contained scenes,\r\nfigures, statues of the utmost lewdness in posture, presentation, and\r\nimplication.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the barbarities of the medieval centuries, many performances,\r\nprocessions, and rites contained an amazing mingling of ecclesiastical\r\nelements and dissolute blasphemies and libertinage: just as the Greek\r\nsatyr plays and the comedies of fifth century Athens were composites of\r\nfunctional representations by human actors of the libidinous and\r\nirreverent actions of the deities themselves.\r\n\r\nThe medieval scene contained secular and monastic lubricity, and\r\nprocessions and rites in which the performers, under the guise of nuns\r\nand prelates, presented shameless and unspeakable obscenities. In\r\naddition, flagellation was inflicted on penitents. In Germany, France,\r\nEngland, and Italy, all ranks, of all ages, underwent phallic\r\ncastigation as an act of devotion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Girolamo Folengo’s _Maccaronea_, published in 1519, there is mention\r\nof manuals that provide magic instruction and prescriptions favorable in\r\ninducing or diverting erotic urges:\r\n\r\n    He opens the manuals, or reads all that are open:\r\n\r\n            How to write arcane spells:\r\n            How to compel love;\r\n            How a husband can find out his wife’s adultery;\r\n            How virginal maidens can be forced to love;\r\n            How to make a hated husband impotent.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the Italian Renaissance the women of Italy played a dominant and\r\nsometimes sinister part in both social and political life. Courtesans,\r\nparticularly in Rome, had a position somewhat analogous to that of the\r\nGreek hetairae. One such courtesan, Imperia, had skill in composing\r\nsonnets. Most of them were literate and interested in intellectual\r\npursuits as well as in erotic interludes. Caterina di San Celso played\r\nand sang. Many women of this type are described by Giraldi in the novels\r\nof the _Hecatommithi_ and by Pietro Aretino in his _Ragionamenti_.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Renaissance was marked by both literary and social\r\nindecencies and lewd lubricities and all kinds of scatological\r\nproductions and performances. In the lavish public entertainments, in\r\nthe Carnivals and Masques, apart from contests, reviews, pantomimic\r\npresentations, the emphasis was consistently on scandalous songs, with\r\nlascivious undertones, innuendoes, suggestions.\r\n\r\nIn literature, the moral atmosphere of this period is reflected in the\r\ndepiction of the most common Renaissance features—adultery and\r\ncuckoldry, all kinds of illicit amours, lusts resulting in secrecies,\r\ngallantries, murder. To satisfy her lusts, a woman poisons her husband.\r\nAn adulteress has her lover kill her husband, without hesitation,\r\nwithout compunction. Love and lust, poison and death, infidelities and\r\nvengeance followed each other in an abandoned, frenzied, amoral\r\nsequence.\r\n\r\nThe Italian strega or witch was a powerful intermediary in amatory\r\naffairs of all sorts. With her preparations, her thaumaturgic skills,\r\nher secret concoctions, she aided men and women in consummating erotic\r\nurges, arousing lustful sensualities, securing the love of hesitant\r\nobjects of passion, promoting vigor and virility, arranging furtive\r\namatory assignations: acting, in short, as an amatory midwife, an\r\nempirical guide in debauchery.\r\n\r\nBy her magical skill the strega was able to aid men and women bent on\r\namatory consummations. Some of these skills were transferred to the\r\nprostitutes. Acquiring these techniques, and discovering the secrets of\r\npreparing potions, they were able to retain a lover, to lure a new\r\nadmirer. For their concoctions and brews they used human teeth and the\r\neyes of dead men, skulls and ribs, scraps of the flesh of corpses, hair\r\nand nails boiled in oil. They made a fire of burning ashes, in the form\r\nof a heart. Piercing the heart, they chanted their goetic invocation,\r\nanticipating the surrender of the hesitant lover by this means of\r\nsympathetic magic. In this sphere, in fact, the Italian Renaissance had\r\ntaken over, as it were, the entire corpus of ancient magic rites, love\r\nbrews, and concomitant procedures in the art of erotic control.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA solemn love conjuration appears in a medieval manual called the _True\r\nGrimoire_. The invocation itself is preceded by special preparations\r\nduring the waxing or the waning of the moon. An inscription is written\r\non virgin parchment, by the light of a taper. The supplication runs:\r\n\r\n    I salute thee and conjure thee, O beautiful Moon, O most\r\n    beautiful Star, O brilliant light which I have in my hand. By\r\n    the air that I breathe, by the breath within me, by the earth\r\n    which I am touching: I conjure thee. By all the names of the\r\n    spirit princes living in you. By the ineffable Name On, which\r\n    created everything! By you, O resplendent Angel Gabriel, with\r\n    the Planet Mercury, Prince, Michiael, and Melchidael.\r\n\r\n    I conjure you again, by all the Holy Names of God, so that you\r\n    may send down power to oppress, torture, and harass the body and\r\n    soul and the five senses of her whose name is written here, so\r\n    that she shall come unto me, and agree to my desires, liking\r\n    nobody in the world, for so long as she shall remain unmoved by\r\n    me. Let her then be tortured, made to suffer. Go, then, at once!\r\n    Go, Melchidael, Baresches, Zazel, Firiel, Malcha, and all those\r\n    who are with thee! I conjure you by the Great Living God to obey\r\n    my will, and I promise to satisfy you.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA technique involving the separation of husband and wife, the converse\r\nof a love-potion intended to attract or cement passion, appears in the\r\nfollowing invocation from a magic grimoire called the _Sword of Moses_:\r\n\r\n    I conjure you, luminaries of heaven and earth, as the heavens\r\n    are separated from the earth, so separate and divide N from his\r\n    wife N, and separate them from one another, as life is separated\r\n    from death, and sea from dry land, and water from fire, and\r\n    mountain from vale, and night from day, and light from darkness,\r\n    and the sun from the moon; thus separate N from N’s wife, and\r\n    separate them from one another in the name of the twelve hours\r\n    of the day and the three watches of the night, and the seven\r\n    days of the week, and the thirty days of the month, and the\r\n    seven years of Shemittah, and the fifty years of Jubilee, on\r\n    every day, in the name of the evil angel Imsmael, and in the\r\n    name of the angel Iabiel, and in the name of the angel Drmiel,\r\n    and in the name of the angel Zahbuk, and in the name of the\r\n    angel Ataf, and in the name of the angel Zhsmael, and in the\r\n    name of the angel Zsniel, who preside over pains, sharp pains,\r\n    inflammation, and dropsy, and separate N from his wife N, make\r\n    them depart from one another, and that they should not comfort\r\n    one another, swift and quickly.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  National Gallery of Art\r\n\r\n  DIANA\r\n\r\n  _by Renoir_\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Metropolitan Museum of Art\r\n\r\n  PYGMALION AND GALATEA\r\n\r\n  _by Rodin_\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the middle centuries prostitution as a civic institution had its\r\ndistinction and its privileges. In Venice, all kinds of secondary favors\r\nwere granted to these practitioners. They were favored with an indulgent\r\nand even eulogistic Latin testimonial: nostrae bene merentes meretrices.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn France, there were orgiastic ceremonies in which the participants\r\nperformed in the nude. These rituals were associated in a contorted\r\nsense with primal creation and were known as Fêtes d’Adam.\r\n\r\nIn one of Boccaccio’s tales there is an instance of a script intended as\r\nan erotic provocation:\r\n\r\n    Quoth Bruno, ‘Will thy heart serve thee to touch her with a\r\n    script I shall give thee?’\r\n\r\n    ‘Ay, sure,’ replied Calandrino; and the other, ‘Then do thou\r\n    make shift to bring me a piece of virgin parchment and a live\r\n    bat, together with three grains of frankincense and a candle\r\n    that hath been blessed by the priest, and leave me do.’\r\n\r\n    Accordingly, Calandrino lay in wait all the next night with his\r\n    engines to catch a bat and having at last taken one, carried it\r\n    to Bruno, with the other things required; whereupon the latter,\r\n    withdrawing to a chamber, scribbled divers toys of his fashion\r\n    upon the parchment, in characters of his own devising, and\r\n    brought it to him, saying, ‘Know, Calandrino, that, if thou\r\n    touch her with this script, she will incontinent follow thee and\r\n    do what thou wilt.’\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Turkey, under the Sultanate, and notably in the sixteenth century,\r\nerotic relations in the seraglio were stimulated by a preparation known\r\nas pastilles de sérail.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century there was a religious-erotic cult in Europe\r\nwhose members were called Loïstes. Their rituals were marked by sexual\r\norgies and erotic aberrations.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe corpus of Shakespearean plays contains numberless allusions and\r\ncomments on sexual and amatory topics. The language, however, in which\r\nthese references are couched is sometimes figurative, euphemistic, and\r\nseemingly innocuous and ingenuous. Sometimes, again, they are so\r\nexpressed in the contemporary Elizabethan idiom as to have an immediate\r\nand illuminating impact on the contemporary audience: but, on a cursory\r\nperusal, the context may not spontaneously reveal the underlying\r\ncurrency.\r\n\r\nThere is, throughout the plays, mention of the functional processes and\r\ntheir media, of the organs of the human body, including what are usually\r\ntermed pudenda. Shakespeare touches on the normal sexual functions and\r\nalso on deviations, on tribadism and coprophilia, on lust and cuckoldry,\r\non adultery and eunuchs, on all manner of erotic encounters, embraces,\r\nand circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn _Troilus and Cressida_, to take an example, lust, libido, and potency\r\nare illustrated:\r\n\r\n    Cressida: They say all lovers swear more performance than they\r\n    are able, and yet reserve an ability that they never perform:\r\n    vowing more than the performance of ten, and discharging less\r\n    than the tenth part of one. They that have the voice of lions\r\n    and the act of hares, are they not monsters?\r\n\r\n                                                             Act 3.2\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n    Troilus: This is the monstrosity of love, lady—that the will is\r\n    infinite and the execution confined; that the desire is\r\n    boundless and the act a slave to limit.\r\n\r\n                                                             Act 3.2\r\n\r\n           Troilus: What will it be\r\n             When that the watery palate tastes indeed\r\n             Love’s thrice repured nectar?—death, I fear me,\r\n             Swooning distraction, or some joy too fine,\r\n             Too-subtle potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,\r\n             For the capacity of my ruder powers:\r\n\r\n                                                                 Act 3.2\r\n\r\nThere are similar references in _The Merry Wives of Windsor_, _Twelfth\r\nNight_, and _A Midsummer Night’s Dream_.\r\n\r\nIn _Pericles_ Priapus is mentioned as a symbol of virility:\r\n\r\n                Pericles: Fie, fie upon her!\r\n                  She’s able to freeze the god Priapus.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrançois Villon, the fifteenth century French lyric poet, was not too\r\nhappy in his loves. In his _Double Ballade_ he makes his personal\r\nconfession on amatory exercises, and gives due admonitions as to the\r\npossible effects of erotic practices:\r\n\r\n                Then love until you have your fill,\r\n                Follow the ball and midnight feast,\r\n                The end will bring you naught until\r\n                You break your head, to say the least;\r\n                For foolish loves make man a beast:\r\n                Idolatrous was Solomon,\r\n                And thereby Samson’s vision ceased.\r\n                Happier those who all this shun!\r\n\r\n                And Orpheus, sweet troubadour,\r\n                Who piped his flute among the dead,\r\n                Risked mortal peril on its spoor\r\n                From Cerberus of the triple head;\r\n                And beautiful Narcissus fled,\r\n                Because of love too lightly won,\r\n                To seek his peace in a watery bed.\r\n                Happier those who all this shun!\r\n\r\n                Sardana, once a valiant knight,\r\n                Who conquered all the realm of Crete,\r\n                Aped woman’s form and took delight\r\n                In girlish chores and things effete;\r\n                And David, quitting wisdom’s seat,\r\n                Forgot his fear of God for one\r\n                Whose perfumed thighs aroused his heat.\r\n                Happier those who all this shun!\r\n\r\n                And Amnon, drunk with carnal power,\r\n                Feigning to gorge himself the while,\r\n                Plucked lovely Tamar’s virgin flower,\r\n                A deed incestuous and vile;\r\n                Herod—and here I use no guile—\r\n                Had John the Baptist’s head undone\r\n                For a dance, a song, a dancer’s smile.\r\n                Happier those who all this shun!\r\n\r\n                Of my poor self I wish to speak:\r\n                Beaten like washing in a stream,\r\n                Entirely nude—no tongue in cheek—\r\n                Who made me chew such sour cream\r\n                But Kate Vausselles?

Some of\r\nthese orders practiced nudism but rejected marriage. Some encouraged\r\npromiscuities in their ritualistic assemblies. The Ebionites, for\r\ninstance, were of this type. Also the Basilidians, a Gnostic sect that\r\nfollowed the principles of the founder Basilides, a Gnostic who\r\nflourished in Alexandria in the second century A.D.; also the\r\nNicolaitans, an early Christian sect.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, in the eleventh century and the twelfth, there was a similar\r\nsect known as the Patarini. They made obscene obeisance to a black cat,\r\nevidently a variant Satanic form, then abandoned themselves to scenes of\r\nfrantic lubricity.\r\n\r\nSo too in many regions of France that still recalled ancient pagan Gaul\r\nsimilar orgiastic performances occurred under cover of darkness.\r\n\r\nEven the Knights Templars, the military-religious members of the Order\r\nthat was founded early in the twelfth century and was suppressed at the\r\nbeginning of the fourteenth century, were reputed to have aligned\r\nthemselves with foul obscenities that involved anal osculation, as in\r\nthe case of the witch members of the Satanic Sabbat, and desecration of\r\nChristian ritual accompanied by erotic perversions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSympathetic magic and the use of wax images were common means of\r\nsecuring amatory ardor compulsively. The ancients were intimately\r\nfamiliar with the procedures. And the grimoires current in medieval\r\ntimes were similarly repositories of dark and occult amatory techniques,\r\nand likewise recommended a variety of rituals. Involved in the\r\nceremonials were of course darkness, the burning of incense, the\r\nconstruction of special pentagrams and magic circles, the shaping of the\r\nfigurine, and the Latin invocation which gave final assurance to the\r\nerotic effects.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmatory intimacies, especially but not exclusively in the Middle Ages,\r\nwere believed possible between human beings and disembodied creatures,\r\nincubi and succubi, sylphs and undines or water spirits, salamanders,\r\nvarious types of Satanic emissaries and subordinates in the infernal\r\nhierarchy, such as Isheth Zemunin, who presided over prostitution.\r\n\r\nSome of these mystic, occult unions, on the other hand, were associated\r\nwith beneficent spirits, with angelic embodiments, saints, and similar\r\npersonalities.\r\n\r\nIn the malefic traditions of the Black Arts and demoniac relationships,\r\nthere was widespread credence in intercourse between witches and the\r\nmembers of the Satanic legions, between sorceresses and Satan himself,\r\nand between the practitioners of magic and all kinds of bestial and\r\nobscene creatures. The medieval demonographers are soberly voluble in\r\nrecounting many such instances. They chronicle, with precise supporting\r\nconfirmatory testimony, tales that brought the participants, the old and\r\nthe young women so accused of diabolic intimacies, to trial, to torture,\r\nand finally to the gallows.\r\n\r\nReady and voluminous evidence comes from Guazzo and Johannes Anania and\r\nJean Bodin, from Henri Boguet and Delrio, from Tartarotti, Stridtbeckh,\r\nSinistrari and Ricardus, Molitor, de L’Ancre, Elich, and Daugis.\r\n\r\nAt the Sabbats, the assemblies of witches and Satanic forces, there\r\nwere, according to the medieval chroniclers and the old European folk\r\ntraditions, frantic performances of the most obscene nature, monstrous\r\nrituals, weird banquets, culminating in lewd orgies characterized,\r\naccording to the grave testimonies of the demonographers, by copulation\r\nof witches and materialized demoniac spirits.\r\n\r\nThe Aphroditic force and influence are all-pervasive. Hence, in the\r\nfield of astrological lore, Venus represents love, in its most extended\r\nsense, normal, illicit, and aberrational. Certain symbols, creatures,\r\nforms are regularly associated with her functions. The lubricities of\r\nthe goat and the bull are under her sway, while, botanically, many\r\nplants, among them vervain and myrtle, are endowed with aphrodisiac\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n                              MODERN TIMES\r\n\r\n\r\nEros is triumphant in the twentieth century, in every social frame, in\r\nevery milieu, and in every country. Henri Bergson, the French\r\nphilosopher who is associated with the concept of _l’élan vital_—the\r\nvital urge, or, as George Bernard Shaw termed it, the life force,\r\ndeclared that this twentieth century has become aphrodisiac.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe love-potion is not a matter of academic history only: it is still\r\nflourishing. It still has its devotees. It is still encountered in\r\nobscure places, where furtive secrecy is of the essence of the amatory\r\npreparations. In the folk mind in particular the love-potion can still\r\nbe efficacious, sometimes grim in its attendant effects, but\r\nunquestionably an accepted and often employed means of directing erotic\r\nfeelings, imposing amatory impulses, on a beloved victim, on the\r\nindifferent libertine, on the wayward and flighty girl.\r\n\r\nOttokar Nemecek in his _Die Wertschätzung der Jungfräulichkeit_ (Verlag\r\nA. Sexl. Vienna, 1953) gives interesting instances of erotic practices,\r\nrituals, religious ceremonials, culled from many ethnic groups. In\r\nFernando Po, for example, a prayer is offered: May the woman and the man\r\nbecome as erotically entwined as the creepers in the forest entwine\r\naround the tree trunks.\r\n\r\nIn Ethiopia a phallic provocation was the wearing on the head of a band\r\nto which a horn was attached. Similarly among many African tribes, where\r\nthe chief wore a phallus-crown with the same intention. As in Hellenic\r\nantiquity, in ancient India and in modern India also, the phallus is the\r\nsymbol of might, of masculine sovereignty, of cosmic creativeness.\r\n\r\nSuch customs and rites, such implicit amatory instigations, have not\r\ndied out. They appear in many forms and guises, sometimes decorative, on\r\nother occasions in fanciful culinary shapes. Amulets and figures in\r\nphallic and genital form were sold, as late as 1894, in the shops of\r\nTiflis, in Caucasia, and in the United States migrants from the Central\r\nEuropean countries still reproduce, in their bake shops, festive genital\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTraditional potions, aphrodisiacs, and similar means of arousing genital\r\nimpulses are in use even at the present time. Carrots, for instance,\r\nwere long listed by the Arabs as a stimulant. In medieval Spain they\r\nwere commonly consumed for such a purpose. And in the United States\r\ncarrots are still reputed to have a marked erotic potency.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCurrent magazines of the more popular sort, contemporary drug stores\r\nhave their amatory allurements. Some periodicals advertise exotic\r\nperfumes, sultry essences, seductive cosmetics and similar feminine\r\naccessories, or insidious unguents and lotions, whose avowed purpose is\r\nto attract men in an amorous direction. In the drug stores, hormones and\r\ngland extracts, transplantations and rejuvenative manipulations and\r\noperations are publicized for similar purposes.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong some primitive tribal communities in New Guinea, powerful love\r\ncharms take the form of genital secretions. Such secretions are then\r\nused in magic ceremonials affecting both man and beast: the underlying\r\nintent being procreational encouragement.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVirility and its concomitants have no frontiers, no temporal\r\nrestrictions. In Central India, in areas that have not yet been\r\nsignificantly affected by the encroachments of modern ways and\r\nprocedures, virility has not become a tribal or personal problem. It is\r\nso normal, in fact, and sexual indulgence is so released from emotional\r\nor social inhibitions and taboos that erotic encouragement in the shape\r\nof unguents, liquids, potions is rare: although there is, as a prelude\r\nto erotic excitations, a preliminary mamillary exercise.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Orient, especially in the islands off South Eastern Asia, erotic\r\nfrustrations may be solved by resorting to the tribal magician, who\r\nholds the communal secrets, the traditional ways of the society, within\r\nhis memory and his jurisdiction. A maiden may be recalcitrant to the\r\nadvances of her lover. He will then approach the magician, who will\r\npresent him with an amulet, a disc or token. The girl who has amatory\r\nintentions in the direction of a particular male will likewise be given\r\na disc to wear, on which there is a design of a crescent moon, a\r\nmoon-coin, as it is termed, fashioned, according to indigenous\r\ntraditions, by the ancient gods themselves, indulgent to help mortals in\r\ntheir erotic perplexities.\r\n\r\nIn extremely stubborn cases, love charms associated with magic\r\nincantations and formulas are brought into operation: certain fruits,\r\nsuch as bananas or cocoanuts, or even a child’s tears.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe love-potion, in respect of its ingredients, is often conditioned by\r\ngeographical situation. The flora and fauna of a particular region\r\nbecome the elements for the amatory goblet. Mediterranean reeds, roots,\r\nnuts, and plants naturally become useful for the philtre. It is only in\r\nextreme cases that exotic items, rare drugs, inaccessible roots are the\r\nobject of any particular composition. So, in Sikkim, a state situated in\r\nthe Eastern Himalayan region, water in which a bird called indigenously\r\nKen fo, or a chameleon, has defecated, forms a potent love philtre. So\r\npowerful, in fact, that it produces a condition of priapism in the male\r\nand nymphomania in the female.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbsinthe is a popular drink in European countries, predominantly in\r\nFrance. It is a liqueur distilled from a bushy plant, that has a\r\nsilk-like stem and small yellow flowers. The plant is found among the\r\nvalleys and foothills of Europe and on the North African littoral, and\r\nprefers to flourish among hedges and ditches.\r\n\r\nThe botanical name of the plant is Artemisia absinthium: that is,\r\nwormwood. Wormwood itself was sacred to the Greek divinity Diana, who\r\nwas also Artemis: hence the designation Artemisia.\r\n\r\nAbsinthe itself, distilled from the plant, is a green liqueur to which\r\nare added aniseed oil, marjoram, and similar aromatic elements.\r\n\r\nUsed regularly, absinthe is not only dangerous, but when taken in large\r\nquantities produces insanity. Yet it has been reputed to stimulate\r\namatory excitation.\r\n\r\nMany noted French writers, poets, and painters have been addicted to the\r\ndrink, notably the artist Amedeo Modigliani.\r\n\r\nThe drink was first concocted by a Frenchman, a certain Dr. Ordinaire,\r\nwho resided in Switzerland. In 1797 the recipe was sold to a M. Pernod.\r\nThe name Pernod has since then been continuously associated with the\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the hinterland of folklore, in antique traditional sagas transmitted\r\nthrough the ages to recent times, in areas that have been for centuries\r\nmore or less unaffected by developments, changes, and innovations, that\r\nis, largely, in rural and secluded regions, old beliefs still cling. Old\r\nways are still followed. Old remedies, beverages, potions are still used\r\nwith anticipations of effective results. This view is illustrated in the\r\nFrench film entitled L’Éternel Retour. As its pervasive theme it\r\nstressed the rooted belief, among the French peasantry, in the efficacy\r\nof the love-potion.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCurrently, a great deal of writing appears constantly in the press, in\r\nlearned journals, in periodicals of a professional nature, and in\r\ncomplete encyclopedias, all devoted to erotic studies, analyses of\r\nsociety in terms of sexual life, and investigations into sexual morality\r\nand sexual abnormalities.\r\n\r\nIn France, the Polish sponsored Biblioteki Kultury has been established.\r\nThis Press has recently produced a study of Pornography and its\r\ninvolvements, by Witold Gombrowicz. In France, too, many surveys on\r\nerotic practices in the field of films, the stage, art have likewise\r\nmade their appearance, in addition to a History of Eroticism. Lavishly\r\nproduced folios are also on the market, in which maisons closes are the\r\nsubject of detailed treatment and description. Their policies and mores\r\nare freely expounded, and the texts are reinforced with photographs and\r\nillustrations of persons and places and towns, along with paintings by\r\nrecognized artists.\r\n\r\nA major project in this field is the Illustrated Encyclopedia Erotica,\r\nto which a number of noted European sexologists and erotologists have\r\ncontributed. Published in ten volumes, under the sponsorship of the\r\nInstitute for Sexual Research of Vienna, this comprehensive compendium\r\nis now reprinted in a new edition by the Verlag für Kulturforschung of\r\nHamburg.\r\n\r\nThere are some 22,000 articles and 12,000 illustrations. The contents\r\nrange over all aspects of human sexual activity, in their relation to\r\npsychology and biology, medicine and jurisprudence, sociology and\r\npsychotherapy. Folklore and ethnography, marriage, prostitution,\r\nfertility rites, rites of initiation, the deviations of society, secret\r\namatory sects, flagellation and biographical memoirs comprise the\r\nintroductory matter.\r\n\r\nOther subjects discussed and examined include: erotic sculpture, sex\r\nmythology, criminology and forensic medicine as they affect perversions,\r\nand contemporary developments along the lines of research.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLiquid and also solid nourishment, when essentially compounded of\r\nwholesome ingredients, will unquestionably, in the contemporary\r\nconsensus of medical opinion, promote amatory capacity.\r\n\r\nTo go one step further, any nourishing food or beverage will, to the\r\nextent of its wholesomeness as an acceptable and normally consumed\r\ncommodity, contribute to the general organic euphoria of the subject,\r\nand consequently to his physiological vigor.\r\n\r\nIn a general sense, therefore, the fantastic or repellent compounds,\r\nbrews and stews, lotions, electuaries, ointments, and philtres that, for\r\nlong centuries, were transmitted either in folk legend or imprinted in\r\ngrave treatises, are, according to medical authority, brusquely\r\ndeprecated, and in many cases entirely discounted.\r\n\r\nYet, as is well known, legend and saga, folklore and tradition, often\r\nretain within themselves accumulated knowledge based on tested\r\nvalidities.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the increase in experimentation along medical, pharmaceutical, and\r\nculinary lines, there is a corresponding emphasis on food and\r\npreparations that promote physiological well-being and act as tonics and\r\nstimulants.\r\n\r\nFor these purposes, extracts of the gonads or sex-glands, and pituitary\r\nextracts, are medically recommended in certain cases of physiological\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\nIn a more gastronomic direction, there are wholesome broths and soups,\r\nsuch as: mushroom soup, lentil soup, celery soup, as well as salads,\r\nlobster dishes, and curries: all of which contain elements that are\r\ntraditionally reputed to aid in increasing vigor.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a novel by John Brophy entitled _Windfall_, and published in London\r\nin 1951, the hero arrives in New York, where he is confronted with the\r\nfact that the drive for erotic aids is as urgent as ever:\r\n\r\nIt was true: where Broadway converged on, before it crossed, the\r\nundeviating straightness of Sixth Avenue, the wide double roadway was\r\nsurrounded by theatres, cinemas, hotels and restaurants and newspaper\r\noffices, indiscernible behind huge, colored, epileptically moving signs\r\nadvocating, pictorially or by blunt lettered exhortation, whiskies and\r\npea-nuts, cigarettes, motor-cars, night-clubs, patent medicines and\r\nproprietary brands of sexual stimulants.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the same novel there is a description of a New York Night Club, the\r\nFreudian Frolics. Here are presented amatory stimulants and visual and\r\npalpable inducements in a contemporary setting, basically identical with\r\nthe Aristophanic performances, the satires of Lucian, the sketches of\r\nAlciphron and the more boisterous narratives of the Middle Ages, the\r\nRenaissance, and, dominantly, eighteenth century France. The scene is\r\nintroduced with a generalization that marks the activities of the place:\r\n\r\n    Beyond the swing-doors almost every erotic taste not utterly\r\n    perverted could be if not gratified at least stimulated ... the\r\n    majority made straight for the primary erotogenic zones.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain, there is a wildly farcical description of amatory reinforcements.\r\nThe character concerned is a degenerate multi-millionaire, an American\r\nnamed Mirabel Jones XVIII. His problem is to achieve an heir to his vast\r\ninterests. For this purpose, he is undergoing a multiple variety of\r\ntreatments at the hands of his physician and his psychiatrist. He is\r\nsubjected to daily injections. He consumes all sorts of tablets. He is\r\nregulated by calisthenic exercises, by vitamin pills, by radio-therapy,\r\nby baths. All these various means are regimented methodically into\r\nprospective erotic channels. As a climax, he travels constantly, from\r\none country to another, to secure a climate favorable to his condition,\r\nfrom South America to California to England.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of the love-potion still intrude into modern times. In\r\na series of light sketches of Scottish life, entitled _Christina_, the\r\nauthor, J. J. Bell, presents young Christina herself, who is living with\r\nan aunt who runs a small village store. To further a possible courtship\r\nbetween the aunt and the commercial traveler Mr. Baldwin, Christina\r\nconceives a plan to help the shy and hesitant Miss Purvis. The book\r\nitself was published about forty years ago:\r\n\r\n    Christina greatly enjoyed looking at the shops without\r\n    supervision or restriction. She had made up her mind to purchase\r\n    a gift for her aunt, whose birthday fell about a month later.\r\n\r\n    Christina enters a barber’s shop, because she has seen the ideal\r\n    gift:\r\n\r\n    She moistened her lips, and, in a tremulous whisper, said—\r\n\r\n    “I want a—a potion.”\r\n\r\n    “A lotion, miss?”\r\n\r\n    “A potion.”\r\n\r\n    “A lotion—for the hair?” He smiled dreadfully—so it seemed to\r\n    Christina. Once more she all but fled.\r\n\r\nChristina had been reading about potions, in a periodical devoted to\r\nlove stories. She tells her aunt, Miss Purvis, about it. “It was a magic\r\npotion. A lass got it frae a—a sosserer to gi’e to a young man that\r\nwasna heedin’ aboot her. She gi’ed it to him, an’ it charmed him, an’\r\nafore she could say ‘Jack Robinson’ he was coortin’ her like fun, an’\r\ntheir nuptails was celebrated in—”\r\n\r\nNow Christina is ready to employ the same means in behalf of her aunt.\r\n\r\nTo the barber, then, Christina whispers: “A potion. What—what’s the\r\nprice o’ yer—yer Spirit o’ Love?”\r\n\r\nThe barber, momentarily nonplussed, finally smiled with understanding:\r\n\r\nA moment later he was brushing a cobweb from a small bottle containing a\r\nyellowish fluid. A soiled and faded label of floral design was affixed\r\nto the bottle, and on it appeared, as in letters of fire, the words\r\n“Spirit of Love.”\r\n\r\n“One shilling, miss.”\r\n\r\n“Would it—charm a lady?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly! I have sold hundreds of bottles of ‘Spirit of Love’ to\r\ngentlemen for that very object. Charms them like magic!”\r\n\r\n“Like magic?”\r\n\r\n“Like nothing else, miss. Do you wish the bottle for a sick friend? Just\r\nso! In that case a few drops on the pillow will prove a real charm.”\r\n\r\nChristina nearly dropped. It was too wonderful!\r\n\r\nHe must be a sosserer!\r\n\r\nChristina administers the potion in her own way. While her aunt is\r\nasleep, she pours a few drops on the pillow, but, disturbed by the\r\nsudden squalling of a cat, lets the phial fall. It empties itself on the\r\npillow.\r\n\r\nThe aunt, a sceptic, throws the empty bottle into the fire, with the\r\nremark “Spirit of Fiddlesticks!”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nExperimentation and research in the direction of rejuvenating processes\r\nand invigorating vigor continue all the time, without cessation. Some\r\nprocedures involve surgical operations: others are associated with the\r\nadministration of various hormones and extracts and glandular\r\ncompositions. Proprietary medicines are on the market, particularly in\r\nFrance and in England. An advertisement in a weekly magazine advocates\r\nThe Royal Jelly Rejuvenating Food Supplement.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the early nineteenth century, in Edinburgh, there were on sale\r\nLuckenbooth Brooches. They were in the nature of amatory periapts. These\r\nbrooches were sometimes engraved with a lover’s initials. Or a plea or\r\nan amorous inducement might appear thereon, such as:\r\n\r\n                            Let me and thee\r\n                            most happy be.\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n                My heart ye have and thir I creve.\r\n                I fancie non but the alon.\r\n                Wrong not the heart whose joy thou art.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnalogous to philtres and similar amatory concoctions is the indirect\r\nstimulus derived from reading teacups. A popular Scottish weekly paper\r\nsays: It’s fun, and there’s a good deal in it, too, if the signs are\r\nread aright.\r\n\r\nIn relation to Love and Friendship, the column declares that a ‘human’\r\nfigure seen in the form of the tea leaves, whether man or woman, or the\r\noutline of a letter of the alphabet, indicates that the love and feeling\r\nof affection will concern the person whose name begins with the tea leaf\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nThis is, in essence, an innocuous variation of an amatory inducement.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong contemporary proprietary preparations reputed to have amatory\r\nvalue is aphrodisin. This is a compound of yohimbine, a substance\r\nindigenous to Central Africa and derived from the bark of the yohimbe\r\ntree, along with extract of miura pauma, aronacein, and other\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are many instances of women, concubines, mistresses, and harlots,\r\nwho have become historically famous or notorious through their own\r\npersonal practices, or for the influence they have exerted socially and\r\npolitically. A French courtesan who rose from minor and humble\r\ncircumstances was Céleste Mogador, who was born in 1824 and who died in\r\n1909. She was a dancer, an actress, and an equestrienne: and ultimately\r\nbecame the Comtesse Lionel de Moreton de Chabrillan. She gained some\r\nadditional réclame by the publication of her Memoirs.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCharles Baudelaire (1821–1867), the French poet, in his _Les Fleurs du\r\nMal_, has a sequence of poems on passion, macabre, violent, distorted,\r\nfilled with fantastic imagery, touched with the symbol of death, and\r\nputrefaction, and unsated human longings. There are hymns to beauty that\r\nborder on disaster and cruelty, on ugliness and inhumanity. There is a\r\npaean to exotic perfumes, a laudation of a woman’s dark tresses. But\r\nthese poetic effusions are stamped with bitterness and a sense of\r\nreality aghast, unholy revelations. There appears an entire distant,\r\nremote world, far-flung and almost extinct, where the poet sees an\r\naromatic forest, where he dwells in the woman’s depths. She pleads with\r\nher lover, for she is unsated and insatiable. He peers through those two\r\ndark eyes, the windows of your soul. O ruthless demon, he clamors, pour\r\nless flame upon me. I am not the dread and furtive Styx, capable of\r\nembracing you nine times.\r\n\r\nA putresent carcass, seen on a summer morning, is a poetic memento mori,\r\nlike an Egyptian skeleton at the feast, a warning that lust and beauty\r\nand passion have their brief day and are grimly evanescent, and an\r\nindirect injunction, on the poet’s part, to adhere to the Roman poet\r\nHorace’s hedonistic _carpe diem_.\r\n\r\nIn _The Vampire_ Baudelaire exclaims at being enslaved by a hateful but\r\nalluring woman, while in another piece he stresses the potency of\r\nperfumes.\r\n\r\nThese poems, then, symbolize, in a comprehensive sense, the intrusions\r\nof lust and passion in human relationships, and the intimate contacts\r\nand associations of these lusts with malefic forces and ominous impacts.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBallads, street songs, and broadsides, belonging to a wide and usually\r\ncomparatively uncultured level, in all ethnic communities, deal largely\r\nwith physiological and scatological functions, sexual and erotic\r\nintrusions and experiences and experiments, without restraint, without\r\nreflection and without moralizing corollaries thereon, but with a\r\nforthright, direct verbal impact. Hence there are, dispersed through\r\nsuch unsophisticated uncontrived versified episodes, many matters\r\nrelating to amatory enticements and means of erotic provocations and\r\nchallenges affecting both male and female, in all types of occupation,\r\nin many gradations of society, at every age level, from young and urgent\r\nmilkmaids and their swains to debauched lechers and libertines.\r\n\r\nPastoral pieces, soldiers’ rollicking ditties, sailors’ chanties, all\r\nthe rhythmic, chthonic, usually crude but outspoken exuberance of folk\r\nways and currents, of peasantry and burgher, tinker and servant,\r\ntipplers, ploughmen, and innkeepers—that is the colorful and various\r\ncomponent of the popular muse.\r\n\r\nSometimes the erotic impact is suggested by indirection: sometimes by an\r\ninnocuous expression used in a double entendre context. Sometimes the\r\nidiom has the immediacy of the Greek functional and genital significance\r\nexemplified in the Aristophanic comedies.\r\n\r\nRakes and panders rub shoulders with guileless innocence and feminine\r\nwiles, with lordly arrogance, authority, and wealth, with humility and\r\nbeggarliness, with want and starvation. And pervasive through all the\r\ninsinuating permutations of street life and market place, of court and\r\nmanor, of fields and ocean, battle and stress, there runs the urgency of\r\namatory attraction: lust and passion and allurement, and the means of\r\nsatisfying and sating and continuing and maintaining such erotic\r\ncapacities, such animal lustfulness and unbridled salaciousness and lewd\r\nardor, prurience and perverted depravities.\r\n\r\nYet there are instances, sudden outbursts, occasional spurts of deeper\r\nfeelings, brusque awareness: some latent though possibly dishonored\r\nprinciple, a touch of wry humor, in which blatant reality and some\r\nremote consciousness of betterment peer through the vernacular\r\ncrudities.\r\n\r\nIn one collection of such ballads, entitled _Drolleries_, the amatory\r\ntheme returns again and again, always lusty, always sensual. The burgess\r\nwho is off to the fair while her good man is absent from home: the coy\r\nmistress: the country maid on a visit to the City: the old lecherous\r\nbeau unrepentantly persistent: the lustful squire, the libidinous\r\ncourtier, the wayward maid: widows and lords, fiddlers and coopers,\r\ncobblers and miners, merchants all conniving in adultery and incest, in\r\nconcocting potions for reluctant lovers, in beseeching hesitant favors,\r\nin besmirching marriage and domesticity and exultantly and indifferently\r\nglorifying all the varieties of amatory diversions and perversions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn _Today_, a popular British weekly magazine, an article appeared early\r\nin 1962, by a woman, accusing the contemporary man of having lost his\r\nvirility. She spoke of ‘sexually moribund men,’ of man’s failure, in\r\nconsequence, as a marriage partner, and of his amatory deficiencies.\r\n\r\nA response to these challenges appeared in a later issue. It was written\r\nby a factory worker who, from his own experience and that of his\r\nacquaintances and fellow-workers, refuted the first attack. He denied\r\nphysical exhaustion. He asserted that the typical worker, by virtue of\r\nhis constant application to his job, is kept continuously physically fit\r\nand capable. His knowledge, too, of the range of amatory procedures and\r\npractices has been widened by war contacts, by interchange of views and\r\nattitudes with many groups, foreigners, visitors, refugees. He added\r\nthat the freedom of expression on such matters was an additional\r\nencouragement toward enlightenment. If anything, this typical worker\r\nconcluded, it was the woman who was hesitant, indifferent, and\r\nun-cooperative.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Gilbert and Sullivan’s _The Sorcerer_, a farcical treatment of the\r\nBlack Arts, there is a scene involving love philtres and their effects:\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wells: Love-philtre—we’ve quantities of it ...\r\n\r\n    Alexis: I have sent for you to consult you on a very important\r\n    matter. I believe you advertise a Patent Oxy-Hydrogen\r\n    Love-at-first-sight Philtre?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wells: Sir, it is our leading article. (_Producing a\r\n    phial_).\r\n\r\n    Alexis: Now I want to know if you can confidently guarantee it\r\n    as possessing all the qualities you claim for it in your\r\n    advertisement?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wells: Sir, we are not in the habit of puffing our goods.\r\n    Ours is an old-established house with a large family connection,\r\n    and every assurance held out in the advertisement is fully\r\n    realized. (_Hurt_).\r\n\r\n    Aline (_aside_): Oh, Alexis, don’t offend him! He’ll change us\r\n    into something dreadful—I know he will!\r\n\r\n    Alexis: I am anxious from purely philanthropical motives to\r\n    distribute this philtre, secretly, among the inhabitants of this\r\n    village. I shall of course require a quantity. How do you sell\r\n    it?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wells: In buying a quantity, sir, we should strongly advise\r\n    you taking it in the wood, and drawing it off as you happen to\r\n    want it. We have it in four-and-a-half and nine gallon\r\n    casks—also in pipes and hogsheads for laying down, and we deduct\r\n    10 per cent for prompt cash.\r\n\r\n    Alexis: I should mention that I am a Member of the Army and Navy\r\n    Stores.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wells: In that case we deduct 25 per cent.\r\n\r\n    Alexis: Aline, the villagers will assemble to carouse in a few\r\n    minutes. Go and fetch the tea-pot.\r\n\r\n    Aline: But, Alexis—\r\n\r\n    Alexis: My dear, you must obey me, if you please. Go and fetch\r\n    the tea-pot.\r\n\r\n    Aline (_going_): I’m sure Dr. Daly would disapprove of it.\r\n\r\n                            (_Exit Aline_).\r\n\r\n    Alexis: And how soon does it take effect?\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wells: In twelve hours. Whoever drinks of it loses\r\n    consciousness for that period, and on waking falls in love, as a\r\n    matter of course, with the first lady he meets who has also\r\n    tasted it, and his affection is at once returned. One trial will\r\n    prove the fact.\r\n\r\n                   _Enter Aline with large tea-pot._\r\n\r\n    Alexis: Good: then, Mr. Wells, I shall feel obliged if you will\r\n    at once pour as much philtre into this tea-pot as will suffice\r\n    to affect the whole village.\r\n\r\n    Aline: But bless me, Alexis, many of the villagers are married\r\n    people!\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wells: Madam, this philtre is compounded on the strictest\r\n    principles. On married people it has no effect whatever. But are\r\n    you quite sure that you have nerve enough to carry you through\r\n    the fearful ordeal?\r\n\r\n    Alexis: In the good cause I fear nothing.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Wells: Very good, then, we will proceed at once to the\r\n    Incantation.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the South Sea Islands amatory aids and spells are still in vogue. The\r\nfollowing love incantation involves the love-sick girl Taratake:\r\n\r\n             Mr. Hair-of-his-head, Mr. Hair-of-his-head,\r\n             Go you to him, to Taratake!\r\n             Whisper my name when he dreams,\r\n             when he wakes.\r\n             When he walks among the women.\r\n             Draw him by the hand,\r\n             Draw him by the foot,\r\n             Draw him by the heart and entrails to me.\r\n             He thinks only of me;\r\n             He dies for love of me;\r\n             There is no woman for him but me,\r\n             no love but mine,\r\n             no love-making but mine.\r\n             He comes to me, he comes, he is here with me,\r\n             With me, Laughter-of-Waves-o-o-o!\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs recently as 1956, in the _Flute of Sand_, Lawrence Morgan describes\r\nan experience among the Ouled-Naïl dancers of North Africa:\r\n\r\n    Interwoven into their lives were sorcery, black magic, and, most\r\n    common of all, the use of love-philtres with which they believed\r\n    they could enslave any man. In the pot of mint tea in Yacourte’s\r\n    room had been a philtre intended to help the erring lover to\r\n    make up his mind.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe term bayadère is derived from the Portuguese baladeira, associated\r\nwith bailar, to dance. Originally, the expression was applied to a Hindu\r\ndancing girl, noted for erotic performances. The bayadère, in fact, like\r\nthe nautsch dancers, could be equated with prostitution.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe European newspapers and magazines, notably in Germany, Austria, and\r\nFrance, until quite recent times, advertised, in the interests of\r\nreaders, all kinds of elixirs, remedies, philtres, concoctions, and\r\nunguents, to correct sexual deficiencies or to promote physiological\r\ncapacity. There was a cream called Vigor. Dragées des Fakirs were\r\n‘scientific and immediate.’ A Parisian aphrodisiac powder announced\r\nitself as ‘durable.’ It could be forwarded by mail, from the Scientific\r\nLaboratories. Clients could be interviewed at specified hours. Renox was\r\na concoction that was urged very persuasively: so too with the\r\ncontrivance Heureka. There was another contrivance called Samson,\r\nimplicitly suggesting a Biblical valor. Sexine and Stimulol and Dragées\r\nde Vénus were both harmless and effective, according to the laudatory\r\ntestimony of the manufacturers themselves.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a highly advertised preparation, called Testogan, that implied\r\nstimulating amatory reactions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA contrivance under the name of Amor Star was formerly advertised in\r\nEurope as very effective, making the agent another Casanova. In Paris, a\r\npreparation called Mono promised rejuvenation for the male.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany European restaurants practiced a dual role. In addition to their\r\nculinary purpose, they were in a basic sense amatory rendez-vous. During\r\nthe First World War German eating-places, variety halls, dance palaces,\r\nand cabarets advertised, with appropriately alluring illustrations:\r\n\r\n                           Wein, Weib Gesang\r\n\r\nIn other instances, Teutonic gaiety was eulogized as being highly\r\nimitative of Gallic ways. Leben à la Paris—ran the posters:\r\n\r\n                           Damenklub\r\n                           Maskenbälle\r\n                           Lustiger Abend\r\n                           Café Dorian Gray.\r\n\r\nThese spots were instigations to perversions, amatory practices, and\r\npromiscuities.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNumerous collections of erotica exist in varying degrees of seclusion,\r\nin libraries, state archives, and museums. To a large extent, such\r\ncompilations were made during the eighteenth and nineteenth century. The\r\nbibliophile, on his death, usually bequeathed his books and manuscripts\r\nand erotic objects and artifacts to a state or national library. Among\r\nEnglish specialists in this genre were James Campbell, the pseudonym of\r\nJ. C. Reddie, William S. Potter, Henry Spencer Ashbee, better known\r\nunder his pseudonym of Pisanus Fraxi. In France, the Bibliothèque\r\nNationale, in its section known as L’Enfer, houses a large collection of\r\nerotic matter.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn cosmopolitan cities like London and New York, the sex theme is\r\npredominant in certain types of rather furtive bookstores. They deal\r\nlargely with paperbacks, stressing sexual relationships, erotic\r\nmagazines, and treatises, both authoritatively written and, in some\r\ncases, barely literate, on erotic mores and variations of perversions.\r\nThe paperbacks, flaunting jackets that play a significant role in the\r\nattraction of the text, range from lust to rape, from masochism to\r\ntribadism, with all possible intermediate permutations. Such fictional\r\nproductions not infrequently transcend the ingenuities of the Marquis de\r\nSade.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nContemporary witches, sorceresses, and spell-binders of varying degrees\r\nof reliability still use, as love potions, old, traditional ingredients.\r\nOne of these is hippomanes. Hippomanes was well known among the\r\nancients. It is a fleshy excrescence that appears on a foal’s head at\r\nbirth. When dried, and swallowed by the person in search of the amatory\r\nexcitation, it produces, according to these dark practitioners, a result\r\nthat cannot be questioned.\r\n\r\nThe erotic merit of this equine aposteme is confirmed by a number of\r\nauthorities, from Vergil himself, the Roman epic poet, to Pausanias, the\r\nsecond century A.D. Greek geographer, and to the sixteenth century\r\nNeapolitan alchemist and occultist Gambattista della Porta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SELECTIVE BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n  Benoit, H.
