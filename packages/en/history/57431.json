The first two documents (written\r\nrespectively by a civil official and a military commander) furnish\r\na reliable and intelligent survey, by eyewitnesses, of political,\r\neconomic, and social conditions in the islands in 1842-43; and thus\r\nsupplement the similar relations (in VOL. LI) dated fifteen years\r\nearlier. The admirable paper by James A. LeRoy who is well known as the\r\nleading authority on Philippine affairs, places before our readers a\r\nclear and orderly review of the last four decades of Spanish rule in\r\nFilipinas--with keen but impartial comments on conditions, events,\r\nand men therein; and with full and well-selected bibliographical\r\nreferences to the best works on the subject. It gives us pleasure\r\nto present here the hitherto unpublished constitution of the Liga\r\nFilipina, from Rizal's own MS. draft; and the friar memorial of 1898\r\n(a curiously mediæval document for the end of the nineteenth century),\r\nwhich heretofore had appeared only in a limited Spanish edition and\r\na partial and unsatisfactory English translation. To these documents\r\nis added an appendix on agricultural conditions in Filipinas, giving a\r\nview of these in 1784 and another in 1866; an outline of the projects,\r\nefforts, and achievements of the noted Economic Society of Manila;\r\nand bibliographical references for the use of the reader. Following\r\nis a synopsis of the above documents:\r\n\r\nOf exceeding interest and importance is the third volume of Mas's\r\nInforme, on the policy of the Spanish government as regards internal\r\naffairs in the Philippine Islands. Intended almost exclusively for the\r\nuse of the government, but comparatively few copies were published,\r\nand hence the volume is of great rarity, and is not mentioned by\r\nmost of the bibliographers. We know with certainty of four copies:\r\ntwo owned in the Philippines, one by the heirs of Clemente Zulueta,\r\nand the other by Epifanio de los Santos (our translation being made\r\nfrom a typewritten copy of the latter); one in the Peabody Institute,\r\nBaltimore, and one in the collection of the Compañía General de\r\nTabacos de Filipinas, Barcelona. Its chief value and importance lie\r\nin its treatment of various vital questions that had already begun to\r\npresent themselves to some minds more or less clearly--the relation of\r\nthe Filipino-Spaniards to those of the Peninsula; questions concerning\r\nthe natives, Chinese mestizos, and Spaniards; separation from Spain;\r\nand lastly, the proposition to free the islands. The document, while\r\ncontaining many things that are general in nature, and which even\r\nappear childish and visionary, is in many other things clear-sighted,\r\nand shows deep and keen observation. The first two volumes of Mas's\r\nwork (which have been cited so frequently in this series) were\r\nwritten in order to form a suitable background to the third volume,\r\nand thus lead to it naturally, by giving a résumé in succinct form\r\nof the history, government, and social and economic conditions of\r\nthe islands. Proceeding to his purpose, the author states that the\r\nintentions of Spain in regard to the colony may be one of three:\r\nperpetual possession; utter neglect; or emancipation. He treats only\r\nof the first and third. To ensure perpetual possession, there are\r\nthree principles to be borne in mind and acted upon: the reduction\r\nof the white population; the subordination of the natives; and the\r\ngeneral reform of the Spanish administration. The growth of the white\r\npopulation fosters the spirit of independence, for the Spaniards of the\r\nPhilippines look upon the islands as their own country, and have no\r\naffection for Spain. Their only concern is to hold possession of the\r\ngovernment posts, but they are lazy and ignorant. They are naturally\r\ndisgruntled by the appointment of peninsular Spaniards to posts in the\r\nislands; for, since the promotions are limited, they cannot hope for\r\nthe advancement that they believe is due them. Their discontent was\r\nseen in practical form in the insurrection instigated in 1822 because\r\nof the officials brought from Spain by Antonio Martinez; and there\r\nwas evident discontent because of the new contingent that appeared in\r\n1825. There are more than one thousand Filipino-Spanish males in the\r\nPhilippines, but only four hundred posts, and their hopes continually\r\nwane at the appearance of officials from Spain, although Spain has\r\nan evident right to send whom it will to the islands. To obviate the\r\ntrouble, Mas suggests that only single men be sent to the islands from\r\nSpain to act as officials, and that they be required to return to the\r\nPeninsula after twenty years' service, with the option of returning in\r\nten years. These men will probably marry Spanish women in the islands,\r\nand on their return to Spain will take their families with them, thus\r\nreducing the white population considerably. It is a mistake to send\r\nwomen to the colony, and a grave error to endeavor to increase the\r\nwhite population there. A plan is proposed for the further reduction of\r\nthe white population by sending all males to Spain at the government\r\nexpense, at the age of sixteen, where they shall be educated at the\r\nexpense of the Manila treasury. The sending of the situado from Spain\r\nfor the support of the islands was formerly a large factor in keeping\r\nthe colony loyal, but since that has become unnecessary the one great\r\ncheck on the colony has disappeared. But separation now would mean\r\nthat the whites would disappear in the mass of the natives, and would\r\neven become inferior to them. It is wrong to infer that the whites and\r\nthe natives will work together, for there is a barrier between them,\r\nand the recent outbreak in Tayabas cannot in any way be ascribed to\r\nthe former. The salvation of the whites lies in agriculture, and great\r\nprofits are to be acquired therein, although the Spaniards are loath\r\nto engage in such work. Their fields can be cultivated by Chinese\r\nlabor, and by captured Moros, and contracts can be made, in addition,\r\nwith individual Filipinos, under certain exemptions. Mas favors\r\nthe system of indentured servants, for self-interest will dictate\r\ngood treatment to them. To ensure native respect for the whites, the\r\neducation of the former must be very restricted, and the colleges at\r\nManila be closed. Filipino soldiers shall not rise above the rank\r\nof private or corporal. Filipino secular priests must be reduced\r\nin numbers, and must, in general, act only as the assistants of the\r\nregulars. Filipinos cannot maintain the dignity of the priestly office,\r\nand instead debauch it, as Mas proves by various letters. Religion\r\nis the mainstay of the islands, and the regular curas must be given\r\nas much power as possible, and officials must work in harmony with\r\nthem. The friars must, however, live morally, abstain from trade,\r\nand not meddle in temporal affairs. Emancipation will be the ruin of\r\nthe friars; and, in order that they may conserve Spanish interests,\r\nall the curas must be Spaniards from Spain. Curas lose respect among\r\nthe natives because they are compelled to collect the marriage\r\nand burial fees, and the government should come to their aid by\r\ncollecting these under the form of a specified tax. Above all,\r\nthe whites must observe religious ceremonies, which they now almost\r\nutterly neglect. The laws of the Indias are executed too rigidly, and\r\nare too favorable to the natives. The latter are becoming arrogant\r\nand impudent, and will end by driving out the Spaniards. Mas would\r\nrequire a distinctive dress for the natives, the chiefs to be the\r\nonly ones who may wear jackets. The priests have been guilty of\r\ndestroying rank among them. Natives must salute all Spaniards and\r\nshow great outward respect. The title of \"Don\" must be given them\r\nno longer, for this gives the idea of equality with the whites. All\r\ngovernment officials must be given decent pay, and must be made to\r\nspend it liberally. Offices should not be given in order that their\r\nincumbents may amass money. Only Spaniards of good character should be\r\nallowed to go to the islands. If the treasury officials are decreased\r\nin number and the collections farmed out, this work should be done\r\nby natives and mestizos, as this is an odious office, and engenders\r\nmuch ill-will. Race hatred must be developed between the Filipinos\r\nand Chinese mestizos as much as possible. The latter are the richer\r\nand more intelligent, and in case of emancipation at this moment would\r\nsoon gain the upper hand. They are hated by the natives. It is highly\r\nimportant to have a respectable and moral Spanish force in the islands,\r\nfor should the native troops mutiny nothing can be done as matters now\r\nstand. Curas should have the power of intervention in the meetings\r\nof the principales, as this method will avoid conspiracy. Natives\r\nshould not be taught how to cast artillery or make firearms and\r\npowder. Indeed, the powder factory recently established should\r\nbe suppressed, as the contract under which it was allowed is not\r\nadvantageous, and better powder is manufactured in Murcia. Steam\r\nvessels are needed for quick communication among the islands,\r\nand to repel Moro invasions, and suppress insurrections. Spanish\r\nshould not be taught to the natives. Newspapers may be allowed,\r\nunder proper censorship; and curas should translate into the native\r\ndialect such articles as are important for the natives. A complete\r\nsystem of police is necessary. Trouble is to be expected from China,\r\nbut it will be quite safe to allow the entrance of a certain number\r\nof Chinese laborers to work on the estates of the whites. They can\r\nbe counted on in case of trouble with the natives, and in case they\r\nthemselves revolt native hatred will soon finish them. It is advisable\r\nto watch the intercourse between foreigners living in the islands and\r\nthe natives. A complete reform is needed in the administration of the\r\ngovernment, which, as now constituted, is honeycombed with laxity\r\nand graft. The laws of the Indias are confused and contradictory,\r\nas is proved by numerous citations. Government is too little\r\ncentralized. Spanish statesmen have been guilty of strange errors\r\nin regard to the Philippines, through their ignorance. Mas proposes\r\na regency of three men, the president to be a Spanish grandee. The\r\nduties of this body are outlined, which in general correspond to\r\nthose of the governor-general and Audiencia. The plan contemplates a\r\nCouncil of State; and thorough judiciary reforms, in order to render\r\nthe judiciary independent of the government. The prestige of rank is\r\nto be observed, as this is a large factor in preserving the status\r\nquo. In the provinces, the provincial chiefs (who are to be sent from\r\nSpain) shall hold all the power, as at present. The treasury reforms\r\nsuggested look toward a lessening of graft, and greater economy. In\r\ncase the Spanish government decides to emancipate the Philippines, the\r\nexactly opposite course must be chosen to the one outlined so fully\r\nfor their conservation. Education and the arts must be encouraged,\r\nnewspapers allowed with but a mild censorship, and the population\r\nmust become amalgamated. To effect the last, dowries should be paid\r\nto the women in all crossed marriages. Native assemblies should be\r\nestablished in order to train them in political matters. Mas favors\r\nemancipation. The islands have been a drag on Spain from the first,\r\nand, if a violent separation comes, it will result in a further loss\r\nof life and treasure. It is interesting to note that he adds a plea\r\nfor the greater humanitarianism of the emancipation plan.\r\n\r\nMatta's report of 1843 in regard to the moral condition of the\r\nPhilippines, and the reforms necessary in administrational and economic\r\nmatters for the conservation of the islands is of great practical\r\nvalue. The report was called forth by the sedition of Apolinario,\r\nthe founder of the cofradia of San José, and the revolt in 1843 of a\r\nportion of the troops. It sets forth the loss of prestige by both the\r\ngovernment and the regular clergy (once the prime support of Spanish\r\nauthority in the islands), and the confusion that is rife throughout\r\nManila and the provinces, a state approaching anarchy. Political\r\nfactions, the troubles arising from the contradictory character of the\r\nnatives, the demoralization in military circles, all demand radical\r\nreforms. A system of law taking into consideration the character\r\nof the natives is needed, as well as greater centralization in the\r\ngovernment, with well defined powers granted to subordinate officials;\r\nsuppression of various religious educational institutions as breeders\r\nof discontent and trouble, and the establishment of commercial and\r\nother schools; abolition of the residencia; and other legislative\r\nand economic measures. For the development of the islands capital\r\nis needed, but reform must precede in order that capital may be\r\nattracted. Agriculture is the main support of the islands, and must be\r\ndeveloped by the whites, mestizos, and Chinese, who will support the\r\ngovernment, and thus offset the immense numbers of the natives. The\r\nreport calls for extensive military reforms and the establishment of\r\na good police system. Tagálog academies are proposed, so that Spanish\r\nofficers may learn the native language. It is of great importance to\r\nconciliate both Peninsulars and Spaniards born in the Philippines,\r\nand to show partiality to neither, in order that prosperity may reign.\r\n\r\nMr. LeRoy's contribution to this volume consists of two parts:\r\na general editorial comment on the modern era of the Philippines,\r\nand some bibliographical notes and further comments for the study of\r\nthat period. The first shows the influences working in and through\r\nthe Philippines and the Filipinos, and is necessarily treated on\r\nbroad lines, detail being scrupulously avoided. The second part is\r\nwritten in the same spirit, but in notes and titles gives the student\r\nfull material for the study of the modern era. By the modern era,\r\nMr. LeRoy means roughly the last half of the nineteenth century,\r\nbut necessarily, in speaking of it, he has been compelled to go back\r\nto influences beginning to be felt before that time. Very briefly\r\nhe sketches the elements making for a broader life in economic and\r\nsocial and political lines; the break-down of old ideas, whose longer\r\ncontinuance was untenable in material, intellectual, and religious\r\nprogress; and the rise of the greater respect and self-consciousness\r\nof the Filipinos. In his bibliographical section, the author treats\r\nfairly and impartially of the threefold development of the Filipinos\r\nand the Philippines: viz., the social; the economic--under which\r\nare discussed general considerations, agriculture, land, etc., the\r\nChinese, industries, commerce, internal trade, navigation, etc., and\r\ncurrency--and the political, under which are discussed the Spanish\r\nadministration and the Filipino propaganda and revolution. Under the\r\nfirst division of the latter are treated the administrative organism,\r\nthe administration as actually working, taxation, legal and judicial\r\nmatters, science and material resources, the Moros and pagan peoples;\r\nand under the second, the religious question, the friar estates,\r\nthe Filipino clergy and their cause, the revolt of 1872, reform and\r\ndemands for more \"assimilation,\" the propagandists, Masonry, the Liga\r\nFilipina, etc., the Katipunan, the insurrection of 1896-97, the pact\r\nof Biak-na-bató and the question of independence. By its mass of\r\ncomment and titles, this section fully supplements the first part,\r\nand presents to the student a comprehensive survey of Philippine\r\nlife and development, that will be found the most useful material\r\nyet published for detailed study of the modern era.\r\n\r\nIn \"Events in Filipinas, 1841-1872,\" the attempt is made only to\r\nindicate general conditions in the islands, by citing very briefly\r\nsome of the more important matters during that period in social,\r\nreligious and economic lines. In addition to this, we have added a\r\nshort bibliography, from which the student may gather abundant and\r\naccessible material for this period.\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Sr. Epifanio de los Santos we are enabled\r\nto present in full for the first time the constitution of the Liga\r\nFilipina (which was organized by Rizal on July 3, 1892) from a copy\r\nmade from the manuscript of Rizal. This constitution shows the Liga\r\nnot to have been formed for the purpose of independence, but for mutual\r\naid and protection of its members, and the fostering of a more united\r\nspirit among Filipinos. Nowhere does it contain a word against the\r\nsovereignty of Spain or against religion. In it are declared the ends,\r\nform, duties of members and officials, rights of members and officials,\r\nthe investment of funds, and general rules. The one exception that\r\nmight be taken to the constitution is that implicit and unquestioning\r\nobedience to all superior commands is required from the members.\r\n\r\nAs the last document proper in this series we present the Friar\r\nMemorial of April 21, 1898, which voices the protest of all the orders\r\n(Augustinians, Franciscans, Recollects, Dominicans, and Jesuits),\r\nbut which was destined never to reach officially those for whom it\r\nwas intended (the Spanish government, through the minister of the\r\ncolonies), because of the appearance in Spanish waters of the American\r\nsquadron, and the defeat of the Spanish fleet. It is fitting, however,\r\nto present this document in this series, as it is a complete statement\r\nof the friars' standpoint, and especially as the last document of\r\nthe series, as it marks the passing of the old Spanish régime. The\r\nbeginning and ending alike express the loyalty of the orders to\r\nthe Spanish government, and throughout the document is noted the\r\nexpression of the patriotism of all the members of the orders as\r\nSpaniards. The memorial, as a whole, is a protest against the charges\r\nbrought against the friars from both Spanish and Philippine sources;\r\nagainst free-thought; against Masonry and other secret societies;\r\nagainst the secularization of the orders, episcopal visitation,\r\nsecularization of schools, and all the other demands of the separatists\r\nand insurgents. That the friars are the cause of the insurrection, they\r\nindignantly deny. They have ever done their duty, and have worked in\r\nthe interests of religion and the Spanish fatherland. The insurgents,\r\nthe filibusters, the separatists, of both Spain and the islands,\r\nhave directed their whole cry against religion in order to veil their\r\nreal purpose. The friars have borne all the vilification that has\r\nbeen directed against them patiently, but they cannot for their own\r\nhonor do so longer. They are proud of their record throughout the\r\nhistory of the islands, and are mindful that, as the only permanent\r\npeninsular social factor in the Philippines, they have christianized\r\nthe islands, have maintained peaceful relations therein, and have\r\nkept them for Spain. Only since the entrance of those imbued with\r\nthe revolutionary free-thought, and of Freemasons, have the islands\r\nbeen disturbed--a period of about thirty years. The Katipunan society\r\nis nothing else than a society constructed on Masonic principles,\r\nand its rapid diffusion of late throughout many districts greatly\r\ncomplicates the problem and renders the remedy more difficult. Had\r\nthe orders been silent in the face of the attempts of the Masons,\r\nof the filibusters, and of the insurgents, they would not have\r\nbecome an object of persecution; but since they always stood out\r\nfor the traditional religion and for Spain, the storm of abuse and\r\nill-treatment has fallen upon them. They challenge their detractors and\r\ncalumniators to prove charges that they have not fulfilled their duty,\r\nand those of personal immorality. They have not committed abuse in the\r\ntaking of parochial fees; they are not hostile to education (indeed,\r\nall the education of the islands has been established and fostered\r\nby them); they do not despise the educated natives, but, as is easily\r\nproved, are good friends with them. Most of the graduates from their\r\ninstitutions have remained loyal, and the same is generally true of\r\nthe wealthy classes. The real cause of the rebellion can be traced\r\nback to the government in allowing the entrance of free-thought into\r\nthe islands and the dissemination of Masonic doctrines, which have\r\nled to the lessening of respect for religion and for Spain; and, as\r\nthis has come about, it has been natural for race hatred to spring\r\nup. The only way of obtaining peace is to strengthen the religious\r\nlife of the islands, and to force out all the revolutionary forces\r\nof free-thought and Masonry. The mission of the friars must receive\r\ngovernment support and respect, else it will be impossible for them\r\nlonger to remain in the islands. They do not desire temporal honors, or\r\nto take part in the civil affairs of government; they are even willing\r\nto relinquish the slight official intervention that they possess: but\r\nthey must demand the honor due to religion which has always been theirs\r\nby right. They are governed in their actions by the Syllabus errorum\r\nof Pius IX. The laws of the Indias, the actions of the sovereigns, the\r\ninstructions to Legazpi: all commit Spain to the maintenance of friars\r\nin the Philippines, and to the greater interests of religion. Even\r\nearlier, the Siete Partidas of Alfonso the Wise command respect to\r\necclesiastical persons. This respect, therefore, the friars demand,\r\nif they are longer to remain in the islands, and be the support of the\r\ngovernment. This memorial is one by those who are fighting for life,\r\nand who see dimly ahead the fate that may overtake them.\r\n\r\nThe subject of agriculture in the islands is briefly treated in\r\nan appendix, showing conditions in the islands in 1784 and 1866, as\r\ndescribed by Governor Basco and the German traveler Jagor respectively;\r\nthe aims and achievements of the Economic Society of Manila; and\r\nreferences to the more important writings on agriculture in the\r\nislands. All show how backward were the conditions of that industry,\r\neven to the end of the Spanish régime, although various efforts\r\nwere made by Spain to institute reforms and promote the cultivation\r\nof the soil; but most of these were too superficial and partial to\r\nbe successful--indeed, they were continually hindered by the whole\r\nsystem of Spanish colonial administration and the deficiencies in\r\nthe native character and training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Editors desire to express their cordial thanks and\r\nacknowledgments for information, suggestions, and other assistance\r\nrendered by the many friends of this undertaking.

Written\r\nby the author of the \"Aristodemo,\" of the \"Sistema musical de la\r\nlengua castellana,\" etc. [1] Volume III. Their internal political\r\ncondition. Madrid, January, 1843.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-four chapters which I have presented hitherto, [2] have\r\nonly been preliminary studies, in order that I might treat of the\r\npresent matter; for it would be an ill thing to speak of the internal\r\nadministration of the country, or of the line of policy that it is\r\nof advantage to adopt therein, without passing in review its anterior\r\ndata, analyzing its elements, and forming an opinion of its resources.\r\n\r\nThe laws of every state must have one object, and the wiser and more\r\nperfect they are, the better they fulfil their end. To discourse,\r\nthen, on those laws which are advisable in Filipinas, one must take\r\nnote of the intentions that the government may have in regard to the\r\nislands. These intentions will probably be reduced to the following\r\nplans or principles.\r\n\r\nTo conserve the colony forever, that is to say, without its separation\r\nbeing even thought of.\r\n\r\nTo consider indifferently its loss or its conservation, and the fate\r\nof the Spaniards living in the colony.\r\n\r\nTo resolve upon emancipation, and prepare the colony for giving it\r\nfreedom. [3]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the second of these three fundamental policies,\r\nnothing occurs to me to say, except that it follows in everything,\r\nas hitherto. I shall treat, then, only of the first and last.\r\n\r\nIn order to conserve the colony, it is necessary, in my opinion, to\r\nwork with reference to the spirit of the following three principles,\r\nwhich I shall endeavor successively to explain: 1st. It is advisable\r\nto reduce the Spanish-Filipino [4] population to the least possible\r\nnumber. 2d. The people of color must voluntarily give respect and\r\nobedience to the whites. 3rd. The general administration demands a\r\ncomplete reform.\r\n\r\n1st. It is advisable to reduce the population, etc. In the epochs\r\nwhen the light of experience was lacking, it was believed that the\r\nmost powerful means of assuring the possession of a colony was to\r\nincrease the white race therein as much as possible; and, as a school\r\nfor this conviction, they preferred to send thither as employes\r\nthose who had the most children, especially female. The Council of\r\nIndias [5] has, up to its last gasp, given proofs of this erroneous\r\nidea. But since then it has been seen that, in fleeing from Scylla,\r\nit has fallen into Charybdis; for among this white population born in\r\nthe country, there is formed a local interest opposed to that of the\r\nmother-country, which begins by creating a discontent, and ends by\r\nsuggesting the desire for independence. [Although a Filipino-Spaniard\r\ncalls himself a Spaniard, all his sympathies are in the Philippines,\r\nand Spain is only secondary in his thoughts. Generally the sons or\r\ngrandsons of government employes, Filipino-Spaniards, receive but\r\nlittle education, are fond of playing the gentleman, are lazy and\r\ndissipated. Little inclined to a professional or business career,\r\nthey put all their efforts on securing a government post. As it\r\nis about one-half of the posts do belong to them, but since the\r\nbest posts depend upon the favor of the Madrid ministers, the\r\nFilipino-Spaniards are constantly disappointed in the promotion\r\nwhich they believe belongs to them by right. Consequently, there is\r\nmuch ill-will and complaint. Camba's pamphlet, [6] although chiefly\r\nwritten to prove that there was no disloyalty in the Philippines,\r\nyet noted the anger and consequent mutiny (June 2-3, 1823) [7]\r\nbecause of the arrival of Governor J. Antonio Martinez (October,\r\n1822) with a large staff of Peninsular officials and sergeants; as\r\nwell as the displeasure manifested in October, 1825, by the arrival\r\nof a new contingent of civil and military officers with Governor\r\nMariano Ricafort. Still, it is not right to expect that, so long as\r\nSpain does not intend to abandon the Philippines, it should refrain\r\nfrom sending Peninsulars to fill the posts there or cease to exercise\r\nthe appointing or removing power as it sees fit. If all the posts are\r\nreserved for the Filipino-Spaniards, it cannot be expected that the\r\nislands will remain loyal to a country so distant from them. In fact,\r\nthe Filipino-Spaniards, under existing circumstances, cannot receive\r\ngreater consideration than at present. The natural and necessary\r\npreference for Peninsulars in the posts of the Philippines engenders\r\nthe hatred of the Filipino-Spaniards toward them; but, on the other\r\nhand, this hatred has been greatly exaggerated by the Peninsulars,\r\nwho are intolerant and contemptuous of the colonials. This contempt,\r\nMas illustrates by two examples, of which he was an eyewitness. Such\r\nthings, together with the contemptuous nickname given them by\r\nthe Peninsulars, gives rise to much ill-will on the part of the\r\nFilipino-Spaniards, who declare that all the cause of the enmity\r\nbetween the two classes comes from the former. The real cause, however,\r\nof the hatred, is economic, and a matter of the posts. Each of the male\r\nFilipino-Spaniards is seeking a post, but since there are only four\r\nhundred posts of all kinds in the islands, while the Filipino-Spaniards\r\nnumber about one thousand, the trouble must be continuous and must even\r\nbecome exaggerated, just so long as a remedy is not applied. Such a\r\nremedy would be for the government to refuse them any post in the army\r\nor other department of government service in the Philippines, although\r\nrecognizing them as Spaniards with full rights if they come to reside\r\nin the Peninsula. Mas proceeds to elaborate his plan for decreasing the\r\nwhite population of the Philippines. All Spaniards going from Europe to\r\nthe Philippines before the age of fifteen or sixteen must be regarded\r\nas Filipino-Spaniards. It is proposed that only single men be sent to\r\nfill posts in the islands, and that they be compelled to return to the\r\nPeninsula after twenty years, with permission to return in ten if they\r\nso please. It will be natural for these men to marry Filipino-Spanish\r\nwomen, who with their children will accompany their husbands to the\r\nPeninsula at the end of the twenty years. Transportation should be\r\nat national expense. On a basis of three passages for each family,\r\nthe cost would be only 450 pesos. Each twenty years, there would be\r\none thousand two hundred return passages to be paid. This would cost\r\nonly 27,000 pesos annually. In return, four hundred men would have\r\nto be sent to the islands each twenty years, or with allowance for\r\ndeaths and other contingencies, five hundred. At 300 pesos apiece,\r\nthis would cost annually 8,750 pesos; and the total transportation\r\nexpense would be only 35,750 pesos. Although transportation is not\r\nnow paid by the government, the strange mismanagement is practiced\r\nof sending married men with families, thus increasing the white\r\npopulation. On the basis that there are three thousand five hundred\r\nyoung Filipino-Spaniards in the islands (both male and female), and\r\nreckoning sixty years as the average life of the individual, there\r\nwould be fifty-eight and one-third individuals for each year of the\r\nsixty years, of whom one-half would be women (and hence eligible for\r\nmarriage with the Peninsulars). All the males shall be taken to Spain\r\nat the end of the fifteenth or sixteenth year at national expense,\r\nand there educated at the expense of the Manila treasury in whatever\r\nprofession they choose. These shall reside in the Peninsula thereafter,\r\nwhere they shall be given a post. Some few of the thirty or so of the\r\nmales reaching the indicated age annually, will doubtless prefer to\r\ndevote themselves to commerce or industry; hence at the most there will\r\nbe only about twenty-five passages of young men to reckon on annually,\r\nwhich will be an inconsiderable expense. If this plan be carried out\r\nthere will be few children to transport after sixteen years. European\r\nSpaniards, if prohibited from marrying native Filipino and mestizo\r\nwomen, will marry only Filipino-Spanish women. Hence, as they\r\ncontinue to retire to Spain, the white population will constantly\r\ndecrease. There will not be a sufficiently large number of whites to\r\nbecome turbulent, and the domination of the Peninsula over the islands\r\nwill be ensured. This plan can be carried out at an annual expense\r\nof about 40,000 pesos, and probably much less. This will really be\r\na saving over present expenses, for retirement and widows' pensions\r\ncost more, the widow of an oidor receiving 18,000 reals vellon. Hence,\r\nthe passive classes receive about 175,000 pesos annually. However,\r\nMas does not advocate that those receiving pensions at present be\r\ndeprived of them or sent to Spain, as this would be unjust and cause\r\ndiscontent. In former years the quarrels and discontent did not lead to\r\ndesire for independence. The population was not so great as now; also\r\n(and especially) since an annual situado was sent from the Peninsula\r\nto pay the government employes, and the latter thus depended on the\r\nSpanish treasury, they would have gained nothing by rebelling. This\r\nis the case at present in the Marianas Islands, where the officials\r\nare paid and supported from the money and food sent there, and the\r\nfew whites there, consequently, have no desire for independence.] It\r\nwill also be asked, in addition, whether, in case the Philippine colony\r\nseparated at present, it would be possible for the white population to\r\nbecome masters of the country, or would there be a tendency for them,\r\nperhaps, to amalgamate with the colored population. The observation\r\nis very just. The Filipino-Spaniards do not think of forming a body\r\nwith the (Indian) natives, nor is it possible for them to desire it,\r\nfor now they are the masters and in such an event they would become\r\nequals and even inferiors, since the vast mass of the natives would\r\nquickly reduce them to nullity in the matter of government, and\r\nin place of the privileges and exemptions from paying taxes, which\r\nthey at present enjoy, they would more than once have to obey and\r\nhumble themselves before the very one who now mops the ground that\r\ntheir foot touches. In the recent occurrence of Tayabas, [8] when\r\nthe first news of the insurrection arrived, I was at a gathering of\r\nseveral Spanish leaders, and they all believed, or at least suspected,\r\nthat the whites of the country had compromised themselves in the\r\nmatter. I maintained immediately, and obstinately, that they were\r\nmistaken in this, since however disloyal and intemperate one may fancy\r\nthe Filipino-Spaniards, it was impossible for me to believe that it\r\nwould ever enter their heads to arouse and arm the natives. In fact,\r\nthe true spirit of the movement was soon known, and it was seen that\r\nthe Filipino-Spaniards were as alarmed at the result (if not more\r\nso) as were the Europeans. Their hopes and plans, then, can only be\r\nbased on the persuasion that the natives and Chinese mestizos will\r\ncontinue quiet, and pay the tribute as at present, and that they will\r\nmake their patrimony from the country, and share its posts. This idea\r\nis highly absurd, no doubt. Much less loved by the natives than the\r\nEuropeans, without the support of the friars (for even granting the\r\ncase that those living in the country should remain, others would\r\ncease to go from the Peninsula), without capital, in a weak minority\r\nfor the subjugation of more than two hundred thousand rich, active,\r\nand intelligent mestizos, and three and one-half millions of natives\r\n(who have already rebelled against the Spaniards themselves, in spite\r\nof the great prestige of the reenforcements that could be received from\r\nthe other side of the seas), and compelled by force of circumstances\r\nto adopt a liberal and intelligent system with reference to these\r\nsame natives, which would speedily make the latter more arrogant and\r\nexacting than at present, it is quite easy to see that the government\r\nof Filipinas, would within a very few years, fall into the hands of the\r\nIndian Filipinos, or, perhaps, into those of the Chinese mestizos, or\r\nof the two races mixed, and that the whites would become submissive to\r\nthe people of color--if they were not despoiled of all their property,\r\nas having been usurped and without valid title, just as happened to the\r\nTurkish families who had acquired possession in that land during the\r\nlong rule of the Turks in Greece, in which, since the insurrection,\r\nnot a single Mussulman has remained. It is clear, therefore, that\r\nthis Spanish population, long established in the country, is the one\r\nthat has most to lose. In case of an outbreak, the Europeans would\r\nreturn to España, where they would continue their professions and\r\nwould find their kin. The Filipino-Spaniards, however, would have\r\nto change utterly, for they would lose everything, and would have\r\nto seek another country. These are obvious and important truths, and\r\nnevertheless, can we tax the individuals in question with being blind\r\nor stupid, when we see repeatedly in the history of popular revolts\r\nthat a Bailly, a Danton, in fine, that the most clever and eminent\r\nmen persuade themselves that they are able to stop a revolution at\r\nthe line which they trace, and do not suspect that they are going to\r\nbe the victims of the masses who rise?\r\n\r\nFor the white population that remains in the country, and for all\r\nwho are living there at present, agriculture offers an abundant\r\nresource. Very fatal is the deep-rooted idea that Spaniards cannot\r\nprosper in it. [Mas cites several instances to prove that Spaniards can\r\nsucceed in agriculture in the Philippines. He also cites the instances\r\nof the Ansaldos family as told by father Agustin de Santa Maria, who\r\nacquired great wealth from agriculture, and who moved to the Peninsula\r\nduring the English invasion.] Reflection: Just as the two Ansaldos\r\nbrothers, leaving the life of trade, which the Spaniards in the Indias\r\ngenerally follow, applied themselves to the cultivation of the soil\r\nthrough their own efforts, lived many years, and succeeded in amassing\r\na fixed and permanent capital, why could not the same be done by so\r\nmany idle spongers who go about Manila with their white faces begging,\r\ndeceiving, terrifying, exciting, and confounding all the inhabitants?\r\n\r\nThe present superintendent of the islands, Don Juan M. de la Matta,\r\n[9] whose opinion I greatly respect, because I truly believe that\r\nhe is one of the few Spaniards who know the country, and that he has\r\nthe capacity, honor, patriotism, and energy to do something good and\r\nsolid there, wrote me in a letter now before me: \"It is necessary\r\nfor the Spanish population to stick to agriculture, the only source\r\ncapable of providing abundantly for their necessities, for which the\r\nprofit from any other employ in the different careers of the state\r\nis indeed very insufficient. I have already called the attention\r\nof the ministry of the treasury to this particular, showing that a\r\nwretched generation, and consequently, one dissolute and turbulent,\r\nis increasing daily, and that the government must prevent in time\r\nthe fatal consequences, by inviting them to turn their attention\r\nto agriculture. [10] In fact, there are rich and extensive lands\r\nwhich have been abandoned, which ought to invite the attention of a\r\nFilipino-Spaniard more than the posts, for with an estate not only\r\ncan he live in ease and independently, but he can also establish a\r\nrich patrimony for his descendants. Lands that now are worth little,\r\nor even nothing, will in time have a greater or less price by reason\r\nof the population of the territory and the perfection to which its\r\ncultivation is carried. There is today in the charity hospital of\r\nSidney an aged woman, whose husband owned a bit of land, which he\r\nsold thirty years back for three pounds sterling, and at this moment\r\nit is worth one-half million pesos fuertes. And this, only because\r\nof the rapid increase in population! In Filipinas itself, any one\r\ncan be convinced of this manifest fact, which is a trivial truth\r\namong economists. In Laguna and other provinces, there are most\r\nfertile fields, abandoned and at the disposal of the one who will\r\ntake them; and in Bulacan and Tondo, whose soil is very inferior,\r\nall have owners and a value. In the environs of Malolos and Manila,\r\nland costs one thousand pesos fuertes per quiñon. One hundred years\r\nago, this same quiñon could be bought for fifty.\"\r\n\r\n[The difficulty in attracting the whites to an agricultural life lies\r\nin the labor question. Mas does not consider advisable the system of\r\nthe Dutch in Java, [11] and prescribed by certain laws of the Indies,\r\nof compelling the natives to work in estates at the established wage\r\nscale, \"as the natives have been accustomed for three centuries to\r\nbe humored and allowed freely to work or live in idleness according\r\nto their fancy.\" He proposes that the heavy tribute of the Chinese\r\nwho cultivate the lands of the Spaniards be reduced to the small\r\namount paid by the Chinese mestizos; also that negritos, Igorots,\r\nand captured Moro pirates be made to cultivate the fields for the\r\nSpaniards. He also recommends the plan of indenturing the condemned\r\ncriminals out to the cultivators, as England did with its criminals,\r\nwho were sent to America in former periods. This system Mas does\r\nnot consider as unjust or inhumane, but quite the contrary, for the\r\nfarmers, since their pocket book is touched, will be more considerate\r\nthan the prison officials. He recommends the awarding of prizes for\r\nthe cultivation of cacao and coffee; and \"finally, the authorization of\r\nindividual contracts, by means of which Filipinos may bind themselves\r\nto work on the estate of a Spaniard for a certain number of years,\r\nas is done in the military service, such Spaniards then remaining\r\nsubject until the termination of the contract. These persons, during\r\nsaid time, shall be exempt from service in the army, and exemption\r\nfrom polos and personal service may even be conceded to some (for\r\ninstance, to one for each quiñon of land).\"]\r\n\r\n2d. People of color must voluntarily respect and obey the whites. In\r\norder to attain this object, it is necessary to maintain the former\r\nrace in an intellectual and moral condition which will make of their\r\nnumerical majority a political force less than that which resides\r\nin the second, just as a pile of straw in the balance weighs less\r\nthan a gold nugget. The farmer or the goatherd does not read social\r\ncontracts, or know more than what takes place in his own village. This\r\nis not the class of people who have overthrown absolutism in España,\r\nbut that class who are educated in the colleges, and who know the\r\nprice of guarantees, and fight for them. We must not depart from\r\nthis point of view, if we are to discuss the matter sincerely. The\r\nmaking of liberals must be necessarily avoided, for in a colony\r\nthe words liberal and insurgent are synonymous. The consequence of\r\nthe idea will be to admit the principle that each step forward is\r\na treading backward. It is necessary to circumscribe the education\r\nto primary schools where reading, writing, and arithmetic will be\r\ntaught, continuing as at present with one school in each village,\r\nand leaving their direction to the curas. The colleges for males\r\nnow existing in Manila must be closed. [12] In English India, whose\r\neducational institutions and free government are of so much weight\r\nwith some, there is nothing similar to this, and an Englishman who\r\nwishes to become a lawyer, a notary, a physician, or a military or\r\ncivil official, has to go to England for study and graduation--I say\r\nEnglishman, for the natives do not even enter into the question.\r\n\r\nIn the service of arms, they must not rise beyond privates or at the\r\nmost corporals. It is much better to make a sergeant or officer from\r\na Spanish farmer, even though he cannot read and write, than from the\r\nmore capable native. On the contrary, the more dexterous and deserving\r\nis the latter, so much greater will be the mistake committed. Here\r\nthe one who plays for gain loses. It is less dangerous and more\r\ntolerable to bestow the rank of officer on a very stupid, vicious,\r\nand cowardly fellow.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to provide that a Spanish cura be placed in\r\neach village, and it is preferable to leave a village without a\r\nminister rather than to place it in charge of a Filipino secular\r\npriest. Between Filipinas and España there is no other bond of union\r\nthan the Christian religion. This bond is very powerful, and may\r\ninduce the islanders to love and to defend the Spanish domination as\r\na duty. In no place better than in España is it known of what the\r\nreligious influence on the masses is capable, even in violation of\r\ntheir most direct interests. To imagine that the natives will become\r\nfond of our government because they judge it good or the best possible,\r\nI believe a vain project. Their ignorance regarding the condition of\r\nother peoples does not permit of their entering into such comparisons;\r\nand those who might be capable of doing it, will discuss political\r\nmatters; and however excellent such men consider our domination,\r\nthey would always think that it would be more advantageous for them\r\nto withdraw from the yoke and seize the scepter in their own hands,\r\nand pass by this method from their humble condition of vassals and\r\nsubjugated to that of masters and mandarins. Therefore, just as the\r\ncommunity is sustained by virtue and the monarchy by fidelity, this\r\ncolony, in my opinion, must be maintained by religion. Starting from\r\nthis beginning, nothing can become so direct an agent for promoting\r\nemancipation, as the ordaining of priests among the natives. [13] Some\r\npersons observe that they are unfit and vicious, and consequently,\r\ndo not infuse respect, exercise influence or cause fear. More, if a\r\nFilipino secular priest lives in a state of intoxication, and even\r\ncommits, as has indeed happened, atrocious crimes which lead him to\r\nthe scaffold, he does not for this cease to be a priest; and thus he\r\ndegrades the class to which he belongs, and undermines the prestige\r\nof sanctity surrounding the character of a religious man. And this\r\nidea, namely, that because they are Filipinos, they cannot have any\r\ninfluence, has been destroyed by merely the recent insurrection in\r\nTayabas, where a lay-brother, a young fellow, without any personal or\r\nantecedent quality that could make him respected, was able, by means\r\nof a religious matter--without the printed copies of the admonition\r\nof the archbishop of Manila, or the Spanish friars of the neighboring\r\nterritory, being able to prevent it--to cause a settlement to mutiny\r\nand to arm a crowd of three or four thousand men, even to the point of\r\nfiring upon their own pastors, who only saved themselves by means of\r\nflight; to kill the governor of the province; and attack the national\r\ntroops. And so that my opinion in regard to this matter is, and has\r\nbeen, that of many others who studied the country, I shall copy a\r\nfew extracts illustrative of the matter. [14]\r\n\r\n[Mas's first extract is from a communication to the king from\r\nGovernor Aguilar, dated November 25, 1804. In this letter, Aguilar\r\ncharacterizes the native secular priests as lazy and dissolute. He\r\ncites a recent example of a village, evidently previously in charge\r\nof the native seculars, where a Recollect priest has been placed in\r\ncharge, and where in consequence the church has been completed and\r\norder preserved. Although there are some good native priests, they\r\ndo not infuse the respect that the regulars do, for the latter are\r\nnever intimate with their parishioners, while the native priests,\r\non the other hand, live on an intimate footing with them, and enter\r\ninto every detail of their lives. Consequently, the regulars can\r\nmanage the natives better than the native secular priests. Again the\r\nreligious have no ties, and hence their only care is their church\r\nand their duty. The native seculars are burdened with relatives,\r\nwho even live in the curacies with them, and hence, they neglect\r\ntheir churches which soon fall into ruin. It would be bad indeed\r\nfor the islands if the bishops were to transfer the curacies to the\r\nnative seculars. That might be done when there are Spanish secular\r\npriests who possess the right qualities, but to transfer them to\r\nthe natives would be committing a great wrong. If all the villages\r\nin charge of native secular priests had friar curas, they would be\r\nin a much better condition. In Negros, which is in charge of the\r\nnative seculars, nothing is done, a ruinous condition prevails, and\r\nthe villages are greatly depopulated. If the matter were left to him,\r\nhe would not allow a single native secular priest to have charge of a\r\nvillage. They might profitably be used as assistants to the regulars.]\r\n\r\n[The second letter is one from the Manila Ayuntamiento, dated July\r\n12, 1804. This letter is highly laudatory of the friars, who spare\r\nno pains to fulfil their duties. The native secular priests however,\r\nare only in few instances found efficient, and are in general only\r\nfit to act as assistants to the friar curas. The Filipinos with\r\ntheir weak intellects, seem unfitted for the office of priest,\r\nby reason of their lack of constancy. They have not the education\r\nrequisite for the office of priest, for the conciliar seminaries\r\nare little more than a name in which a few native secular priests,\r\nthemselves without sufficient education, attempt to teach. The regulars\r\nsubjected to the royal patronage would be much better than any native\r\nseculars. After Mindoro was transferred from the Recollects to the\r\nnative seculars, the missions quickly declined, churches were ruined,\r\nMoro raids increased, and the tribute of the villages fell off. In\r\nconsequence, the government now wishes to replace the native clergy\r\nby the Recollects. The regulars also further the temporal affairs,\r\nand have done notable things in agriculture. The Ayuntamiento hopes\r\nthat the complaints against the regulars will be disregarded, \"for\r\nalthough there are some defects which they may have, they are always\r\nuseful to religion and the state.\"]\r\n\r\n[The third citation is from San Agustin's famous letter on the\r\ncharacter of the natives. [15]]\r\n\r\nTaking the Christian religion as the foundation upon which\r\nour domination is sustained, it is evident that everything that\r\ncontributes to destroy the religious spirit, destroys and undermines\r\nthis foundation. Under this idea nothing can have more direct harm\r\nthan the degradation and corruption of the minister of divine worship,\r\nand experience has demonstrated this truth. For just as the first\r\nsectarians of Jesus Christ extended his religion rapidly by means of\r\nthe enthusiasm which took possession of their minds, and by means of\r\nthe martyrdoms which they suffered, so also, in all places where the\r\npriests have given themselves to effeminacy, to feasting, to ambition,\r\nand to vices, the belief of the peoples has diminished from that\r\nmoment, and they have ended by falling into religious indifference. The\r\ngovernment ought, then, to consider the clergy as a power; and just as\r\ngreat care is taken not to introduce insubordination and demoralization\r\ninto an army, so also the government ought to watch over the conduct of\r\nthe curas. Let them have all the influence possible over the village,\r\nbut let them always be Spanish Europeans, and allow them to feel no\r\nother interest than España. This is the vital question. If the matter\r\nbe considered under this point of view, one cannot exaggerate the harm\r\nthat a goodly portion of the friars are doing, and the moral force\r\nthat our government is losing because of the manner in which they are\r\nliving. The most general weakness is that of concubinage. Many keep\r\na mistress (who is there called a stewardess [despensera]), inside\r\nor outside the convent. The convent in Filipinas has no cloister, as\r\nit is a parochial house. And this fault, if one considers the climate\r\nof the country, the circumstances, and the ideas of the natives, is,\r\nto say truth, the most excusable and the least harmful.\r\n\r\nThe most pernicious and transcendental fault into which many curas have\r\nfallen especially for some time back--a fault ten times more harmful\r\nthan the one to which we have referred--is that of avarice, fed by\r\nthe practice of trading. It is well known that the mode of trading in\r\nthat country usually consists in usury, that is, in advancing money in\r\norder later to receive products in kind at a very low price. And even\r\nleaving aside this aspect of the matter, it happens, as is natural,\r\nthat the minister, as soon as he has become a speculator, contrives\r\nto get some profit from his position, and from the influence which\r\nhis ministry and the policy indispensable in that country give him,\r\nand thinks little or nothing of the means so long as they conduce to\r\nthe increase of his capital. Sometimes this vice is united with the\r\nfirst, and the stewardess or her husband--who is generally one of the\r\nservants of the convent, whom the friar has married to her, in order\r\nto save appearances--is charged with the gathering, magazines, shops,\r\nsales, etc. But it must be confessed that the government has had a\r\ngreat part in this corruption, by protecting the religious against\r\ntheir superiors. Two left during the term of General Lardizabal,\r\ntaking a large amount with them. When the Augustinian provincial,\r\nFather Grijalvo, went with his secretary, Father Fausto Lopez, to\r\nsee him [i.e., Lardizabal] about one of them (Father Jarava) [16] who\r\nwished to go away with his money, and said provincial asserted to him\r\nthat this was a very bad example, as there were many who would devote\r\ntheir energies to making money, and then leave, although religious are\r\nso necessary in these islands, the said general answered him: \"Do not\r\nbelieve it. You are not so necessary. You are deceived in this. The\r\nEnglish government in India has no friars, and yet that country is\r\nsustained and prospers.\" Nevertheless, in Singapor, he [i.e., Father\r\nJarava] boasted in conversation with the good Bishop Courvery (as the\r\nlatter mentioned to me) of the gold which he carried; and told him of\r\nthe presents which he had had to bestow in Manila in order to obtain\r\nhis passport, especially to the assessor of the government. The most\r\nillustrious bishop wrote that to that capital, and on learning it,\r\nthe guileless general Lardizabal was angry enough to tear his hair,\r\nas was mentioned by the secretary of the government, Cambronero. [17]\r\nIn 1840 they went to inform the alcalde-mayor of a province that\r\nall those who went away with indigo, unless provided with a pass by\r\nthe cura, were detained in the bantayan (a kind of sentry-box) of\r\na village in his jurisdiction. The alcalde ordered the matter to be\r\ninvestigated, and found it to be so; and some passes were brought to\r\nhim, which stated little more or less than \"permit So-and-so to pass\r\nwith so many quintals of indigo.\" The reason for this was that the cura\r\nhad advanced money to them, and feared that if they carried away the\r\nindigo and sold it, it would afterward be impossible to collect the\r\nmoney. The alcalde ordered a verbal process to be formulated, in which\r\ntwo friars and two secular priests made their depositions in the most\r\neffective terms against the cura in question. [The alcalde-mayor wrote\r\nto the vicar of the province, who answered him under date of Batac,\r\nJuly 25, 1840, to the effect that the freedom given by the government\r\nto the friars, who had been relieved of obedience to their prelates,\r\naccounted for this. The government and the ideas of the present time\r\nwere to blame, consequently, not the friar prelates. The friar of\r\nwhom the alcalde-mayor and the vicar wrote boasted that when he was\r\nattacked on the one side he took refuge in the jurisdiction of the\r\nother. Although he boasted that he intended to take his 40,000 pesos\r\nand enjoy life with a female companion, yet he obtained governmental\r\npermission to remain in his curacy.] The curas generally suffer\r\nfrom another defect, namely, that of meddling in temporal matters,\r\nor rather, of endeavoring to abrogate all jurisdictions, and then\r\nassume these in themselves. It is evident that there must be a\r\nlimit to everything, and that those friars who display an insolent\r\nspirit and are usurpers of command must restrain themselves within\r\nlimits. But this evil is one of the least, if our chief and vital\r\nobject be considered to be the conservation of the state. Is it or not\r\na fact that, for España to maintain this colony under its dominion,\r\nit needs the influence of the religious over the inhabitants? If\r\nit is a fact, one must consider these persons as instruments; their\r\ninfluence must be positive; the alcaldes and other employes must be\r\nwheels of the machine, who must be in communication with them, and\r\nto a certain point move at their impulse. So long as the villages\r\nobey the voice of the friars, the islands will be Spanish, for the\r\nfriars can do no less than be so. Emancipation would inevitably cause\r\ntheir ruin. This will appear hard and unendurable to many who are\r\nnot friends of theoretic intervention, especially among the present\r\nmilitary and civil officers of Filipinas; but I understand it in this\r\nway, and do not see by what other agency a handful of Spaniards can,\r\nat six thousand leguas' distance, and without Spanish troops, keep\r\nobedient a vast and wealthy country, which has need of us for nothing,\r\nin which there are not a few elements of independence, and which is\r\ncoveted by many foreign nations.\r\n\r\nAnd if all this is a fact, we can do no less than lament the\r\nunjustifiable imprudence of having printed in the ordinances of good\r\ngovernment now in force, which were printed and distributed throughout\r\nthe whole country, the following:\r\n\r\n[Here follow ordinances 17, 18, 24, 30, 31, 85, 87, 89, 91 and 92\r\n(some only in part), for a synopsis of which see VOL. I., pp. 234,\r\n235, 236, 238, 239, and 256-261. Mas continues:]\r\n\r\nIn no part did the animosity with which these ordinances were written\r\nappear so much as in these last two articles, for they treat of\r\nthe construction of convents, churches, and royal houses; and since\r\nnone of these edifices can be erected without the instructions of a\r\nspecial measure and by authorization, it follows that the government\r\nis dictating provisions to itself, and consequently, it was quite\r\nuseless to insert them in a public law; and although it was intended\r\nthat they should contain the expression of the royal will, the latter\r\nwould always have been sufficient provided that action were taken\r\nin the proper bureau. Moreover, what ordinance 91 says about the\r\npossibility of the sumptuous convents being used as a shelter by the\r\nenemy, as was experienced in the war with the English, seems to me to\r\nbe lacking in common sense. For if they are susceptible of being used\r\nas fortresses, they will be an advantage to those possessing them,\r\nwho may, if they wish, burn them when they have to abandon them. In\r\nthe same category are all the strongholds. For example, in the war\r\nwith the English above mentioned, the latter captured Manila, and\r\nimmediately made use of the forts to protect themselves from Anda's\r\ntroops. Consequently, according to the argument, the fortifications of\r\nManila ought to be demolished. If the enemy defend themselves in the\r\nconvents, it will be because they have to flee from us, and then we\r\ncan desire nothing better than that they shut themselves up, so that\r\nwe may surround them and take them prisoners. If the Spaniards are in\r\nsuch a condition that they look upon the convent as a refuge, they can,\r\nsince they are in their own country, get aid at any moment. A large\r\nand beautiful church, in the midst of a village of bamboo or board\r\nhouses, contributes not a little to inspire a lofty idea of what is\r\nwithin it. All the sumptuous edifices of the ancients were temples.\r\n\r\nThe utility of protecting the religious spirit having been admitted,\r\nthe Spaniards of the province, who in general give a contrary example,\r\nby not fulfilling their church duties, do great harm. This is so\r\nmuch more harmful, as they are in the sight of the entire village,\r\nwhich knows quite well the actions of their most private life. Finding\r\nmyself on the day of Corpus Christi at a place where a large procession\r\nand Church function were being made, not a single Spaniard of the\r\nseveral who were there, went to mass, including the governor of the\r\nprovince. For an alcalde not to go to mass, becomes so much the more\r\nscandalous, as it is the custom for the gobernadorcillo with all the\r\ncommunity and past captains to go to get him at the royal house in\r\norder to accompany him as a matter of ceremony to the church.\r\n\r\nIt happens on account of this that it is enough for them to give\r\nnotice of a Spaniard to the cura so that the latter may have the cura\r\ntold that he is not at home--a thing which contributes to destroy\r\nthe prestige of our name and dominion. Surely, this, joined with\r\nother motives, has contributed to diminish the spirit of devotion,\r\nespecially for the last fifteen or twenty years. This decrease is not\r\nimaginary. I have assured myself of it through several channels, among\r\nothers, through a house that formerly traded in books of religion and\r\nprints. From this I deduce that our foundations are becoming weaker,\r\nand if they are not strengthened, it may be delayed more or less,\r\nbut the edifice will fall. I opine then, that if the colony is to\r\nbe conserved, it is absolutely necessary to take positive measures\r\nto check the exterior manifestations of irreligion; to cause the\r\npriests to appear under the most possible venerable point of view;\r\nand to endeavor to have their influence over the masses powerful. One\r\nof the acts to which the curas now see themselves obliged, and which\r\nrobs them of great prestige, is the collection of the parochial\r\nfees at marriages and burials. A person who has lost a child or\r\na parent by death, has in addition to the grief for his loss, the\r\nexpense which it occasions. He goes to the cura weeping, and tells\r\nhim that he has no money. The cura, nevertheless, must show himself\r\ninexorable; finally the native hands the cura a portion of the sum;\r\nthe parish priest bids him go get the part lacking; he returns with\r\nanother portion; and after seeing that the pretense of his poverty\r\navails him nothing, he pays the whole fee. There are some who come\r\nwith the money divided into the four corners of their handkerchiefs,\r\nand unwrap them one after the other, trying each time to avoid the\r\npayment. The same thing happens in marriages; and there are many\r\nwho live in concubinage waiting until the cura marries them free\r\nof charge. These scenes are very unpleasant to the religious, and\r\nyet, they can do no less than show themselves hard, for if they did\r\notherwise they would be unable to collect any of the fees which belong\r\nto them and form the greater part of their income. And the worst of\r\nall is, that this money which the cura would lose, would probably not\r\nbe used in reproductive investments, but would be spent in feasting\r\nand the cockpit. It would be, then, much more advisable, and very\r\nmuch to the taste of the religious, to have a general tax imposed,\r\nand collected by the alcalde, as now happens with the sanctorum. [18]\r\nOne-half real annually for each soul would be sufficient and would\r\ncompensate, as some of them have assured me, for the present sum of\r\nthe parochial fees. The display in the ceremony of marriage and burial\r\nought to be suitable and designated by rules. Those who desired any\r\nmusic or some extraordinary mourning decorations could pay something\r\nextra. In that way, the parishioners would experience nothing more\r\nfrom their parish priests than agreeable things--counsel, protection,\r\nand alms.\r\n\r\nSince it is very important that the religious, as guides of public\r\nopinion, have essentially Spanish hearts, it is absolutely necessary\r\nfor all these men to be born, to have been educated and ordained in\r\nEspaña. From this is deduced the need of protecting the colleges\r\nexisting at present, and where friars are made who take a vow for\r\nFilipinas. [19]\r\n\r\nTheir pride must be entirely broken, and they must in all places\r\nand on all occasions consider the Spaniard as their master, and not\r\ntheir equal. Our laws of Indias, dictated in the most beneficent,\r\nbut not always in the most wise, spirit, not only concede them all\r\nthe rights of Spaniards, but seem in several points to prefer them to\r\nthe Spaniards, especially in the possession of lands. These benevolent\r\nregulations, often executed with exaggeration by the auditors of the\r\nAudiencia, the protector of the Indians, and the governors-general\r\nwho come from España, overflowing with ideas of philanthropy and\r\nhumanity, and without knowing the natives otherwise than by their\r\nhumble hypocritical exterior with influential persons, have raised\r\ntheir pretensions to an alarming degree.\r\n\r\n[The natives have committed many acts of violence and contempt. A\r\nRecollect cura was beheaded in Talibong, Cebú; the provincial governor\r\nof Negros was assassinated in 1833, and another Spaniard severely\r\nwounded; the alcalde-mayor of Capis was attacked in 1836, but saved\r\nhimself by his presence of mind; the house of the alcalde-mayor\r\nof Antique was burned and he barely escaped the flames; another\r\nalcalde-mayor was taken prisoner to Manila in an iron cage; the\r\ncura and government employes were ridiculed in pantomimic dances\r\nin Capan in 1841; a comedy was to have been enacted at the feast-day\r\ncelebrations at Santa Cruz, Laguna, in 1840, in which the alcalde-mayor\r\nand his court were to be held up to ridicule, but it was avoided\r\nby the arrest of the actors. It has happened sometimes that the\r\ngobernadorcillo remains seated in the presence of a Spaniard with\r\nwhom he has contests in the ayuntamiento. The members of the village\r\nayuntamientos are not accustomed to rise when a Spaniard enters the\r\ntown hall, and even laugh at them; and should the Spaniard grow angry\r\nand strike any of them, complaint is forthwith made to the governor,\r\nwho punishes the Spaniard. An artillery captain and an advocate\r\nwere stoned without cause in a Laguna village. A Spaniard, angered\r\nby the insolent answer of a native, struck him, whereupon the native\r\nthreatened his life. In Manila, the natives are insolent. They do not\r\nyield the sidewalk to Spaniards; coachmen and porters do not rise in\r\nthe presence of Spaniards; Filipino women do not yield to Spanish\r\nwomen either in the stores or the church. Since the new governor,\r\nOraá, has ordered a verbal process against a commandant for punishing\r\na servant, they have become more insolent than ever. Other acts of\r\ninsolence are noted. These things are not heard of by the governor, or\r\nthey lay no stress upon them as they do not recognize their political\r\nimportance. \"Before the justice, the Spaniards and the Filipinos are\r\nequal.\" The latter, however, get better treatment from the governors,\r\nwho have even punished provincial governors severely, while they have\r\ntreated the natives with clemency. The prestige of the Spanish name\r\nmust be preserved. \"He who merits it must without doubt be punished,\r\nnot only for the crime which he commits against humanity and justice,\r\nbut also because it obscures the luster of the Spanish character from\r\nwhich righteousness, benevolence, and liberality ought always shine\r\nforth. But it is advisable that this be among Spaniards, and that no\r\naccount or satisfaction of it be given to the natives. Place them\r\nin the way of rights, and they will not pay until driving us from\r\ntheir soil.\" It is wrong to treat the native with less severity than\r\nthe Spaniard. Mas asserts that in all the countries in which he has\r\ntraveled, he has had to exercise patience to no greater degree than in\r\nthe Philippines. The insolence and disrespect which he has witnessed\r\ndo not allow him to see safety and security for the Spaniards. \"It\r\nseems to me that the islands were more secure in the times when a\r\nnative got down on his knees when a Spaniard passed.\" Mas advises that\r\nSpaniards alone be allowed to wear the neckerchief, and that natives\r\nand mestizos be distinguished by the loose shirt and straw hat which\r\nthey have chosen themselves. Principales only should be permitted\r\nto wear jackets. The religious have destroyed distinction in rank\r\namong the natives in great measure, but while this is generous and\r\ndemocratic, \"the destruction of rank also destroys the principle of\r\nambition, the stimulus for economy and work.\"]\r\n\r\nThe places of cabezas de barangay must not be hereditary, but these\r\nposts ought to be filled by the most wealthy. Among these people\r\naristocracy of money has great influence, but not that of family. In\r\nthe colony, there must be no noble blood except the Spanish. When the\r\nFilipino or mestizo meets a Spaniard, the former shall be obliged to\r\nstop (except at Manila) to salute him. If seated, he shall rise when\r\nthe Spaniard addresses him or passes in front of him. He who raises his\r\nhand against a Spaniard, although it be to defend his own life, shall\r\nincur the penalty of laboring on the public works all his life. If the\r\noffense is verbal, the punishment shall be decreased in proportion to\r\nthe case. A Spaniard shall not give a seat in his house to a Filipino\r\nor mestizo, much less sit at table with him. He who falls into this\r\nfault of decorum, shall be punished the first two times by a fine,\r\nand the third time he shall be exiled from the colony. No Spaniard,\r\nunder any consideration, shall be allowed to contract marriage with\r\nany Filipino or mestizo woman. The Filipinos or mestizos who desire\r\nto use a carriage or a saddle horse, shall have to obtain a permit\r\nfor which an annual tax shall be charged, so that those who sustain\r\nthis luxury may be very few. [Mas condemns the custom of giving\r\nthe title \"Don\" to gobernadorcillos and principales. Even almost\r\nnaked Tinguianes and Igorots are found with that title--which is\r\nridiculous. Let the Filipinos use their own native equivalents for\r\n\"Don\" and \"Doña.\" Also the natives should not be allowed to present\r\npetitions which are disrespectful because of their ignorance of the\r\nlanguage, such as for instance calling the governor a robber.]\r\n\r\nGovernment employes should be well paid, for in a country where\r\nappearances count for so much as in the Philippines, it is not well to\r\nlive in a miserly manner. There are no Spanish grandees in the colony,\r\nand but few of the merchants can afford to live luxuriously. Mere\r\nliving expenses are cheaper than in Spain, and one could if he\r\ndesired save more, but if the natives live better than the ruling\r\nclass, there will be a loss of prestige. Better salaries are paid in\r\nthe Philippines than in Spain, but this is necessary. The governor,\r\nfor instance, must really give some idea of the royal master whom\r\nhe is serving, and this can be done through a certain amount of\r\ndisplay. Each official ought to spend at least two-thirds of his pay.\r\n\r\nNo Spaniard ought to be allowed to go to the provinces who is not of\r\nwell-known good behavior, and who does not leave in Manila a bondsman\r\nfor the debts which he may contract. Passports are at times given to\r\npoor Spaniards, soldiers, or licensed corporals, for example, who go\r\nthrough the villages of the interior defrauding, guzzling, entering\r\nthe houses of the town in an unbecoming manner, asking perhaps,\r\nfood or baggage without paying for them, and finally obliging the\r\nnatives to arrest them. The pernicious consequences of these examples\r\nare incalculable.\r\n\r\n[In case that the employes of the treasury are decreased in number, and\r\ncollections are made by contractors, only natives and Chinese mestizos\r\nshould be accepted as such, on account of the odium incurred. The\r\nlatter class will probably take the contract, which will result in good\r\nas it will tend to develop race hatred between them and the Filipinos.]\r\n\r\nThose races are the ones who make up the population. The one excels and\r\nis strong through its number, and the other through its intelligence,\r\nactivity, and wealth. The ability of the government will consist\r\nin keeping them always separated, and at swords' points, in order\r\nthat they may never form a common mass or public spirit, but that,\r\non the contrary, the one may serve as an instrument to subject the\r\nother. Filipinos would rather associate with mestizos than with\r\nSpaniards, for although the first tyrannize over them, and draw them\r\nunder the yoke so far as possible, they invite them to dine, and treat\r\nthem so that they all appear united. The Spaniards, for the most part,\r\nalways talk to them with an air of superiority, and keep them at a\r\ncertain distance--a thing which naturally disgusts the Filipino.\r\n\r\n[The Filipinos do not, however, like the Chinese any better,\r\nbut on the contrary, respect the Spaniards more as coming from a\r\nhigher race. They regard the mestizos as a bastard race and beneath\r\nthemselves. There are many lawsuits between the two classes for\r\npreference in rank. In villages where there are both mestizos and\r\nnatives, each class has its own gobernadorcillo, although that of the\r\nlatter has now been declared superior in rank, and in case of the death\r\nor absence of the alcalde-mayor, takes his place. They are jealous of\r\nthese privileges, and in case of immediate separation, the mestizos\r\nwould not become the dominant force in the country. This rivalry\r\nis useful for Spanish interests and must be preserved. The Chinese\r\nmestizos will within a century have grown to at least one million\r\nby natural increase and immigration from China; and will possess the\r\ngreater part of the wealth of the islands. They are the proprietors,\r\nmerchants, and educated people of the country, and will dominate public\r\nopinion. This class has no sympathy for Spain and will be difficult to\r\nsubdue. Therefore, the moral force of the natives must be preserved,\r\nand the rivalry between the two classes fomented, so that the natives\r\nmay not become the vassals of the mestizos. Mas proposes a land tax\r\non the mestizos and a distinctive dress. Theaters for both natives\r\nand mestizos, where they can rival and ridicule each other will be\r\nhelpful. Arts and the prosperity of the country must be stimulated,\r\nfor if the natives are left to their natural incapacity and sloth,\r\nthey will be in the power of the Chinese mestizos within a century.]\r\n\r\n[A Spanish force of at least one thousand or five hundred men is\r\nneeded. If the native soldiers mutiny, nothing can restore discipline\r\nunless there is a Spanish force. Some of the governors have opposed\r\neven Spanish corporals and sergeants. The country seems quiet but\r\na terrible mutiny and revolt may occur any day. There were only\r\nSpanish soldiers in the old days, and respect was more manifest. Native\r\nregiments are of modern date. The disreputable regiment of Asia made up\r\nlargely of criminals has caused the Spanish soldiers to lose prestige\r\namong the natives. And besides they have been wretchedly treated. It\r\nwould be well to have soldiers from Borneo or other islands outside the\r\narchipelago. If the British do not object, men might even be enlisted\r\ncheaply in India. This would relieve the natives from service, from\r\nwhich they would gladly be free; and the country would be more secure,\r\nand more prosperous.]\r\n\r\n[The principales should be allowed to hold meetings only in the\r\npresence of the cura. It is well known that they plot against the\r\nalcalde-mayor and the cura at times when they assemble for any\r\ncommon matter.]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish language ought not to be taught them, but they ought\r\nto learn to read and write in their own. It is impossible to avoid\r\nthe introduction of papers and books into the provinces which it is\r\nunadvisable for them to read, and experience demonstrates that those\r\nwho know our language, are almost always the restless ones of the\r\nvillages and those who murmur at, censure, and act contrary to the\r\ncuras and alcaldes.\r\n\r\n[It is folly to teach the natives how to make artillery and\r\nfirearms. Factories for the manufacture of these are now being\r\nfinished in the islands. It would be better to send everything of\r\nthis nature from Spain. Another imprudence is the manufacture of\r\npowder. Besides its inferiority to Spanish powder, and the danger of\r\nallowing the natives to learn to make it, it costs more than that sent\r\nfrom Spain. Although after the delivery of twelve thousand quintals,\r\nthe factory and its effects are to become national property, the\r\nworks which are now not worth more than ten thousand pesos, will\r\nbe worthless.]\r\n\r\n[Mas recommends the use of steam vessels for inter-island\r\ncommunication, for the rapid moving of troops, and the better\r\nprotection of Spanish interests. They can also be used against the\r\nMoros [20] with better effect than the small squadron of sailing\r\nvessels now employed, and will be more economical. Coal and wood\r\nabound in the islands and can be used as fuel.]\r\n\r\nThe publication of a newspaper shall be permitted under the supervision\r\nof the government. In them shall be inserted descriptions of the\r\nbest methods of making sugar, indigo, etc., dyeing thread, tempering\r\niron, and in fact everything that may conduce to the instruction of\r\nagriculture and manufacture; the edicts and orders of the government;\r\nand political news, both peninsular and foreign, edited in the manner\r\nthat is found advisable. [All the village ayuntamientos shall be\r\ncompelled to subscribe to such a paper, and the cura shall be asked\r\nto translate into the native vernacular all useful articles. Foreign\r\npapers are admitted without any charge, and prove, instead of a\r\nbenefit, an injury, for they are all democratic in tone, and foment\r\ndisorder and discontent.] The non-existence of newspapers in Filipinas\r\ncauses a very bad result among foreigners, who consider them and with\r\nreason, the foremost mark of civilization, and at the same time, the\r\ngovernment is deprived of the advantage of guiding public opinion. [21]\r\n\r\nA system of police must be established, especially in the capital. Not\r\nmany years ago, there was a commission of public vigilance, which\r\nwas abolished, I believe, during the government of General Camba. The\r\nneglect of the captains-general in this regard at present is scarce\r\ncredible.\r\n\r\n[Although China has caused and will cause trouble in the future,\r\nstill the salutary punishments that the Chinese have received, and\r\nthe rapid increase in the Filipino population, justify the admission\r\ninto the islands of 15,000 or 20,000 more Chinese, on the basis\r\nthat there are only 8,000 or 10,000 now in the islands. These can\r\nbe scattered through the islands and would work only on the estates\r\nof Spaniards.] Twenty thousand Chinese could work 10,000 quiñons of\r\nland, which planted with sugar cane would yield annually 2,000,000\r\npicos of sugar. This sugar sold at Manila at only 3 pesos fuertes\r\n[per quintal] would produce the sum of 6,000,000 pesos fuertes. [In\r\ncase of a popular insurrection the Chinese would all side with the\r\ngovernment and if an attack were threatened from China, it would be\r\nsufficient to turn them over to the Filipinos, who, because of their\r\nhatred for them, on account of their superior industry, would soon\r\nmake short work of them.]\r\n\r\n[Foreigners are useful because of their knowledge and capital, and\r\ncreate much wealth for the islands through their continued traffic\r\nwith their own countries. But their presence does not promote the\r\nconservation of the colony.] Formerly the feeling against this class of\r\npersons was very pronounced, owing in great measure to the religious,\r\nwho always spoke of the English, Dutch, etc., as heretics, drunkards,\r\nand barbarians. The antipathy thus engendered was highly important,\r\nin case of an outside attack. [The natives are now friendly to\r\nforeigners, who pay more liberally than Spaniards, and even Spaniards\r\nat Manila are aping the English and are friendly to them. Undesirable\r\nbooks have and will surely be introduced through the foreigners; and\r\nconsequently, the laws forbidding them to go to the provinces must\r\nbe enforced, and entrance to Manila must not be easy. La Place, the\r\nFrenchman, although he wrote many inaccurate things of the islands,\r\n[22] recognized the danger from foreigners, when speaking of the\r\nslaughter of the foreigners in 1819 during the cholera.]\r\n\r\n3rd. The administration requires a complete reform. The command of\r\nFilipinas has always been entrusted to a governor and captain-general,\r\nas if it were a province of España. To set some balance to his\r\npower, because of the distance from the throne, certain privileges\r\nand preeminences have been granted to other persons, especially to\r\nthe Audiencia, even to the point of making of the latter a court of\r\nappeal against the measures of the chief of the islands. Besides, the\r\nrevenues have been removed from his jurisdiction, and the office of\r\nthe intendant has been constituted, who obeys no others than the orders\r\ncommunicated to him by the ministry of the treasury from Madrid. [23]\r\nIt is very obvious that this single point is quite sufficient to\r\nparalyze completely the action of the governor-general. Besides,\r\nsince there are many matters which require to be passed on by distinct\r\nministries, it happens that two contrary orders touch the same matter,\r\nor that one order is lacking, which is enough to render its execution\r\nimpossible, the contingency moreover arising that a chief may detain\r\na communication, even after he has received it, if it does not suit\r\nhim. This system of setting obstacles in the way of the governor of a\r\ndistant colony is wise and absolutely necessary, but since the Leyes\r\nde Indias are not a constitutional code, but a compilation made in\r\nthe year 1754 [24] of royal orders despatched at various epochs and by\r\ndistinct monarchs, in which are decided points of government, justice,\r\nwar, politics, revenue, procedure, etc., there results rather than\r\na balance among the various departments of authority a confusion of\r\njurisdictions, the fatal fount of eternal discord. [Mas cites laws\r\nfrom Leyes de Indias showing the great confusion and contrariety\r\nof the orders to governor and Audiencia. This confusion has given\r\nrise to scandalous and tragic events because of the contests over\r\nauthority. During these latter years have occurred many offenses of\r\nlike nature. General Enrile had them with the intendant, and General\r\nCamba mentions several during the period of his government. To\r\nthese difficulties, is added another, in order that the chariot may\r\nrun right and easily; the government of the provinces is in charge\r\nof an alcalde-mayor, [25] who is at once judge of first instance,\r\nchief of the political matters, subdelegate of the treasury, and\r\nwar captain or military commandant, for whose different attributes\r\nhe is subject to authorities distinct from one another. This appears\r\ninconceivable, but yet it is a fact, although the cleverness of our\r\nIndia legislators has not been so great that it could free the system\r\nof the inconveniences which necessarily must obstruct it.\r\n\r\nWhatever difficulty occurs in the fulfilment of an order, it must be\r\nsolved by means of a conference and advice [consulta], [26] from which\r\na reply is not obtained until from twelve to fourteen months. These\r\ndifficulties are more frequent in Filipinas than in a province of the\r\nPeninsula, because of the lack of knowledge of the country generally\r\npossessed by the ministers who dictate the measures. Things have gone\r\nso far that it has been ordered that the cultivation of the balate\r\n(a fish) be encouraged; and that the situado of Zamboanga be sent\r\noverland, because of the loss of the ship which was carrying it across\r\nto the island of Mindanao, where D. Infantes was then governing said\r\npresidio. The superintendent Enriquez says in the document which he\r\nprinted on leaving his post in 1836, [27] that in the short period in\r\nwhich he filled the superintendency, he sent to the court six hundred\r\nand twenty-seven questions for resolution. And to these springs of\r\ntorpor in the administration of the government, we must add that\r\nthe captains-general scarcely decide any question whatever, without\r\nhanding the matter for report to the assessor, fiscal, Audiencia, etc.,\r\nbecause of the distance and impossibility of consulting España, and\r\nthrough their fear of compromising themselves, since on many occasions,\r\nmeasures have been obtained against them in Madrid, through agents and\r\nrepresentatives or through complaints sent from the islands. The same\r\nthing happens with regard to the intendant and other authorities. From\r\nthis practice arises the system of expedientes [28] which reigns,\r\nand which is so fatal to the prosperity and good government of the\r\ncountry, since very often the arrangement that appears good to some,\r\nis contrary to the opinions or interests of others. [Expedientes\r\nlasting for years have been formulated for matters requiring immediate\r\nattention. For instance, one lasting for years was formulated in\r\nregard to an expedition against the Moro pirates. An expediente is\r\nformed when a foreigner arrives at Manila without a passport from\r\nSpain and asks permission to remain in the country, although the law\r\non this point is explicit. Thus much valuable time is lost and the\r\nexpedientes result in only a waste of paper, besides great injury\r\nto the islands. The governor often has to conform to the opinions\r\nexpressed in the expediente, although he knows they will be the cause\r\nof injustice. [29] On the other hand, the governor is often directly\r\nat fault, because he enforces his own opinion on his assessor, who has\r\noften obtained his position through favoritism and is not a lawyer,\r\nand decides questions according to the will of the governor. Besides,\r\nthe governor has the armed force at his disposal. The chiefs of\r\nthe various departments at Manila carry on correspondence with\r\nthe directors-general of their respective departments in Madrid,\r\nwithout the knowledge of the governor, a fact that increases the\r\nconfusion and disorder. The director of the mails even is at fault\r\nin this, and renders accounts to the general post-office department\r\nin Spain.] A sub-inspector of engineers newly created, just went to\r\nManila with orders to extend the fortifications of the capital to\r\nits suburbs. The suburbs contain about fifty thousand inhabitants\r\nscattered throughout various villages which are composed of houses\r\nall of one story in height, which is enough to give an idea of the\r\nextension of the imagined fortification. The amount of artillery for\r\ngarrisoning their walls, the workshop necessary to keep the artillery\r\nin good condition, the garrison necessary for their defense, besides\r\nthe operating gangs: all were to be in the greatest magnitude, and\r\ndemand an annual expense which the treasury of the colony could not\r\neven remotely meet. And if one reflect that the enemy can take all the\r\nother islands and even disembark at any point of Luzon itself without\r\nthe necessity of going to Manila; that if this capital were besieged,\r\nit would be by enemies coming by sea, and hence, being masters of the\r\nport, they would very quickly take by hunger a place of one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand souls, or indeed it would be surrendered by the natives,\r\nand then the inhabitants, instead of contributing to the defense,\r\nwould open their doors to the aggressors; and that the concentration\r\nof the forces, the property, the archives, and public and private\r\nwealth, at one single enclosed point, is to form a target to call\r\nthe attention of exterior and interior enemies: we can do no less\r\nthan agree that the plan of extending the fortifications of Manila\r\nto all its suburbs lacks all reasonable foundation, and that it will\r\nbe advocated only by the many people who possess houses on the shores\r\nof the Pasig River, within cannon range, because of their fear lest,\r\nif the events of 1762 are again repeated, all those edifices which\r\nthey were by a fatal lack of foresight permitted to raise successively\r\n(an evil which it is now very difficult if not impossible to remedy),\r\nwould be leveled to the ground.\r\n\r\n[However, the present condition of the treasury will not allow this\r\nplan to be executed. The sub-inspector of the artillery has petitioned\r\nthat all companies of the regiment be commanded by captains of the\r\nstaff. This would cause discontent among the subalterns who would\r\nsee all hope of promotion vanish forever. They can rise now only to\r\ncaptain, and some of them are even now angry. The artillery corps\r\nhas always been loyal to the government and it is advisable to keep\r\nit so. Officers might indeed be trained in the military college,\r\nbut in that case the promotion of the sergeants must be arranged\r\nfor. Complaints of the military in the Philippines mean more than they\r\ndo in Spain where the complainers are retired or exercise patience. But\r\nthis substitution may be made without consulting the governor, as it\r\nis a matter concerning the artillery itself.]\r\n\r\nIn the various departments of the administration there may also be\r\nabuses to examine or correct, which will never be known or exactly\r\nproved by chiefs resident in Madrid, because of the distance which is\r\nso favorable to the distortion of facts. For example, the brigadier of\r\nthe navy, Don J. Ruiz de Apodaca, told me before the sub-inspector\r\nof artillery and another chief that all the articles which were\r\nbought by the treasury for the arsenal, were charged at a much\r\nhigher price than those for the fort, etc., and he invited me to go\r\nto his house where he would prove it to me with the documents. On\r\nthe other side, I have heard complaints that after a contract had\r\nbeen made with the treasury for cables, iron, etc., it is impossible\r\nto get a receipt for them in the arsenal, unless for a bonus; that\r\nquantities of timber will not be receipted for and those who have\r\ntransported it to Cavite have to sell it at any price; and that it\r\nis bought by the very ones who have qualified it as useless; that\r\nmany houses have been built in Cavite with the timber given out as\r\nno good, only with the object of making new bargains. Don F. Ossorio\r\ntold me in the house of the secretary of the government, and in the\r\npresence of several respectable persons, that when he was commandant\r\nof artillery at that place, he made all the furniture of his house\r\nwith wood which he bought in the arsenal as firewood. It is a fact\r\nthat naval construction is very dear, and that the fragata \"Esperanza\"\r\ncost more than 600,000 pesos fuertes. During my stay in the islands,\r\nthere has been talk of trickery in the outlay of tobacco, besides a\r\ndefalcation in the magazines of three thousand eight hundred bundles\r\nof leaf. It was declared that there was introduced, for example, into\r\nthe factory magazines, a quantity of bundled tobacco, in which was one\r\npart composed of fillers [palos] which had to be burned as useless; but\r\nif these fillers amounted to five thousand arrobas, only four thousand\r\nwere destroyed. The other thousand arrobas were taken out as leaf of\r\nthe best brand [from the magazines] and was carried to private houses\r\nwhere it was manufactured as contraband. This leaf was replaced by the\r\nfillers which ought to have been burned. For that reason, the cigars\r\nwhich were sent to the tobacco shops of the provinces, and even those\r\nwhich were sold to the trade, were sometimes of the worst quality;\r\nthat the boxes were short weight; that choice lots were finished with\r\ncare, and marked with a mark, and papers were given authorizing the\r\nexchange of tobacco in the factory, by which means the associates in\r\nthese speculations could buy the poor tobacco which was given to the\r\npublic, and leave it in the national magazines, taking in place of\r\nit, that manufactured properly and reserved. But what I know to be\r\na positive fact in this matter is that few or many superior or fine\r\nboxes were made, which were obtained by favor in Manila; and that when\r\nDon Luis Urrijola [30] left the intendancy, the tobacco had lost its\r\ncredit, and nine thousand boxes were held in the magazines, which no\r\nmerchant then or since has cared to buy. The new superintendent, Don\r\nJ. M. de la Matta took direct and positive measures by separating the\r\nmagazine from the factory, and reducing the functions of the latter\r\nto the manufacture only, etc., whereupon the requests for the new\r\ntobacco were renewed, so that when I left Manila, it was impossible\r\nby a great amount to meet the demands of the trade. But had it not\r\nbeen for the providential appointment to the superintendency of said\r\nclever and zealous employe, perhaps that revenue would have entirely\r\nceased. This is one of the foremost resources of that country, and\r\nthe governor-general would at this moment find himself, perhaps, in\r\nthe greatest straits, and it would be impossible to prevent the evil,\r\nalthough he knew its origin and progress, as he had no intervention in\r\nthe department of the treasury, which is, nevertheless, the soul of all\r\ngovernment. In the same place I also heard talk of the sale of posts,\r\nof abuses in the pay of vouchers and other matters. [These things\r\nmay be misrepresentation or calumny, but they are ever increasing in\r\nforce and are being repeated with exaggeration--which tends to weaken\r\nSpanish prestige which is the source of their moral strength.]\r\n\r\nI believe that all that I have observed is enough and more than enough\r\nto show that the actual system of administration suffers from capital\r\ndefects, and to assert that, in my opinion, the organization of a\r\ngovernment is peremptory, which besides being a check on despotism\r\nand a barrier to ambition, by means of correction and reform through\r\nitself, contains the elements of unity, concord, prudence, rectitude,\r\npower, and duration. Here follows for what it may be worth, a plan\r\ncircumscribed on fundamental bases. [31]\r\n\r\n[Mas's plan provides for a regency or commission of three persons,\r\none of whom shall be the president and exercise the powers of the\r\ngovernor-general. A fourth member is to be elected as a substitute in\r\ncase of death or illness, who, until called upon to fill any vacancy,\r\nshall travel through the provinces and study the conditions of the\r\ncountry. All matters of importance, especially money matters must be\r\ndecided at a meeting of the regency, and appear by an act signed by\r\nall three. The president shall communicate and sign all orders, and\r\nall official communications must be sent to him. The two secretaries,\r\npolitical and military, shall receive orders only from the president,\r\nand shall attend the meetings of the regency without vote. The\r\npresident alone shall decide questions of detail and procedure and\r\nexecution, in accordance with the regulations, always expressing\r\nwhether any measure has been voted on or not. The secretary shall\r\nsend concise daily reports of all communications signed during the\r\nday by the president, noting after each one whether it was with or\r\nwithout the vote of the regency. Thus the other two regents having it\r\nin their power to call for the rough draft of any measure, can easily\r\ntell whether the president has overstepped his executory powers and\r\nencroached on the powers of the entire regency. This provision will\r\nobviate any such tendency on the president's part, and will remove\r\nthe jealousy of his two associates. The plan further provides for\r\na commander-in-chief of all the army; a commander of the navy; a\r\nsuperintendent of the treasury; a court of justice; and a Council\r\nof State, to be composed of the officials above mentioned, together\r\nwith the chiefs of artillery and fortification, the contador-mayor\r\nof accounts, the contadors of the army and treasury, the archbishop\r\nof Manila, and the provincials of the religious orders. The Council\r\nwhich has no power to assemble of its own accord, shall be assembled\r\nto consult on serious matters by the regency. At the death of the\r\npresident, the senior regent shall assume his office, the substitute\r\nshall take a regular seat in the regency, and the Council shall appoint\r\na new substitute to act provisionally until the court make a regular\r\nappointment, which shall never be the provisional appointment of\r\nthe Council. The deliberations of the Council shall be secret and\r\nthe regents shall only state the matters for discussion and then\r\nretire. The Council may be assembled at the request of the regents\r\nacting either singly or in accord. In impeachments of the president,\r\nif the impeachment is sustained, the senior regent shall take his\r\nplace; if it is not sustained, the Council shall retire, but may\r\nbe assembled any number of times for the same matter. There is a\r\nclause against lobbying in the Council to influence the votes of the\r\nmembers. In case of two summons at the same time, the Council shall\r\nobey the one emanating from the president or senior regent first.]\r\n\r\nThe members of the regency shall be jurisconsults, owners of estates,\r\nor military men, and the regularly-appointed president shall always be\r\na grandee of España. It is highly important that, at that distance,\r\nthe first chief impose some personal respect, and that even his very\r\nlineage make him appear superior to all the others.\r\n\r\n[The dissension manifest in Basco's term as governor was due to\r\nhis low rank, as he was only a captain of fragata when he went to\r\nthe islands as governor, a fact that gave rise to envy. He was an\r\nexcellent governor, but the ministry that supported him did not know\r\nthe sentiments that move the human heart. Governor Lardizabal also\r\nwas of lower rank than some who served in subordinate positions in\r\nthe islands. It would be better to appoint a grandee to the post of\r\ngovernor; for, having his estates in Spain, he would be more loyal. A\r\ngrandee also could better support the prestige of the government than\r\na poor soldier or man of no rank, as he would be more accustomed to\r\nthe duties of that life. A soldier generally desires to make money,\r\nand will neglect his real duties. As a rule there are no battles\r\nto be fought, while there are many duties of an administrational and\r\nindustrial character. The governor must have tact with the natives, and\r\nlook carefully after foreign, commercial, and industrial relations,\r\nand the progress of the islands. It would be highly advisable to\r\nchoose such a man when General Alcala is relieved.]\r\n\r\n[For the government of the provinces, advocates shall be appointed\r\nfrom Spain, and they shall remain no longer than twenty years in\r\nthe islands. There shall be three classes of provincial governments\r\nwith distinct salaries. In addition to the requisite number of\r\nprovincial governors there shall be six or eight substitutes in case\r\nof vacancies. These shall receive a salary of fifty pesos per month,\r\nso long as they are not called upon to fill a vacancy, and shall\r\nmeanwhile do the bidding of the regency. A vacancy in the governments\r\nof the first class shall be filled by the regency from the governors\r\nof the second and third classes; and one in the third class from the\r\nsubstitutes. Governors may be transferred at will by the regency,\r\nand the relative importance of the various provinces may also vary.]\r\n\r\nThe provincial governors shall be as now political chiefs, judges of\r\nfirst instance, subdelegates of the treasury for the receiving of\r\nthe direct incomes, managers of the mails, and war captains. This\r\ncentralization has many advantages, a very chief one being the\r\neconomic. The inconveniences which follow from it, will disappear\r\nwhen there is one supreme authority in the islands.\r\n\r\nThe limits of the provincial courts shall be enlarged to include\r\nboth civil and criminal cases. This will increase the power of\r\nthe subordinate authorities, and decrease the troubles of the\r\nAudiencia. The party [in the suit] shall always have the recourse\r\nof appeal.\r\n\r\nThe superior court of justice shall be composed of three persons,\r\none of whom shall be the president. It shall try criminal, civil,\r\nand contentious matters as well as trade questions by appeal. Appeal\r\nmay be had from its sentences to the regency, which shall appoint\r\nthree advocates to judge the case. These latter shall become joint\r\njudges, and together with the three judges shall form the court of\r\nappeal. This court shall be presided over by one of the regents or\r\nby the substitute with a vote, the jurisconsult member being rightly\r\npreferred for this if there is one in the regency.\r\n\r\n[The fees of the court of appeal shall be larger than those of\r\nthe Audiencia; and if the decision of the latter is found correct\r\nthe penalty shall be increased; the death sentence, however,\r\nbeing abolished. A vacancy in the court of justice shall be filled\r\nprovisionally by the regency, and regular appointment shall be made\r\nfrom Madrid, which must be otherwise than the provisional one made\r\nby the regency, unless such appointment be made before the action of\r\nthe regents is known in Spain. This will tend to make the judiciary\r\nindependent of the government.]\r\n\r\n[In regard to the treasury employes a plan similar to that of the\r\nprovincial governors shall be adopted. The custom of sending employes\r\nfor any of the treasury posts from Madrid, many of whom are ignorant\r\neven of bookkeeping, means death to the hopes of those already in\r\nthe islands, and breeds discontent.]\r\n\r\n[This plan does not involve any extra expense. The president shall\r\nhave a yearly salary of 12,000 pesos, in addition to the palace of\r\nManila and the house at Malacañang; the two regents shall each receive\r\n6,000 pesos and 1,000 pesos extra for a house; and the substitute\r\n4,000 pesos--a total of 30,000 pesos. [32] Posts of rank in Manila\r\nhave lately been increased, and now there are a lieutenant-general,\r\na mariscal de campo, six brigadier-generals, and many colonels and\r\ncommandants; and yet men of lower rank than all these have been\r\nappointed governor of the islands. There is no need of so many\r\nmilitary titles. A brigadier-general, with 6,000 pesos' pay acts as\r\nsecond commandant of the navy, which consists of but a few gunboats;\r\nand a sub-inspector of engineers has just arrived who has only\r\ntwo officers under him. Colonels can serve in place of brigadiers,\r\nand since they receive 2,000 pesos less, this will be a saving of\r\nat least 10,000 pesos. This added to the 7,000 pesos that can be\r\nsaved from the affairs of justice being managed by three persons,\r\nwho have no administrational duties, the 13,000 pesos saved from the\r\npresent salary of the captain-general, and the 1,000 pesos given as\r\na gratification to the commandant of the marine corps, will mean a\r\ntotal saving of 31,000 pesos.]\r\n\r\n[Mas also proposes the establishment at Madrid of a ministry of the\r\ncolonies, [33] through whom all the communications of the regency shall\r\npass. It should have departments of government, war, navy, revenues,\r\nand justice. It can easily turn over to other ministries what primarily\r\nconcerns them, and work in harmony with them. For instance it would\r\nnot elect bishops, but would determine their number and salary.]\r\n\r\nThus far I have given minute details on the three principles which,\r\nin my opinion, I said it was necessary to adopt as basic policies\r\nin order to conserve the Filipinas: namely, to avoid the increase\r\nof the white population; make of the colored population, a docile\r\nand well-inclined mass; and reform the present administration. I\r\nhave still to add that I conceive it to be of the foremost interest\r\nto always have in that treasury a sufficient store of spare funds\r\nto at least cover the expenses of one year. [It will be impossible\r\nto realize loans in case of either internal or external war. The\r\ntreasury has been continually exhausted for years, and has drawn on\r\nthe obras pías. Notes have been drawn on the Manila treasury for over\r\nthree million pesos, on which interest is being paid, and there is\r\nno hope of paying the principal.] Such a method of doing things, is,\r\nin my opinion, a political imprudence twice over--in the first place\r\nbecause the islands are left exposed to reverses from a faction or\r\nfrom a foreign enemy; in the second, because it causes certain murmurs\r\namong their inhabitants, and a discontent difficult to conceive of\r\nhere, and which may precipitate their ruin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter having discussed the means of conserving the colony, supposing\r\nthat this is always the intention of the government, let us consider\r\nthe other extreme, taken in review, namely, to resolve to emancipate\r\nit and prepare it for giving it liberty.\r\n\r\nIn order to attain this end, it becomes natural, as is necessary,\r\nto adopt a system diametrically opposed to the first. The chief\r\nobject must be that it does not cause the shedding of blood, that the\r\nrelations of friendship and of trade with España are not interrupted,\r\nthat the European Spaniards living there do not lose their chattels\r\nor landed property, and, especially, that our race there, the\r\nFilipino-Spaniards, preserve their estates and their rights of\r\nnaturalization, and free from the unfortunate fate that threatens\r\nthem, and which is even inevitably expected for them, if the colony\r\nseparates by force and at this moment. It is needful to encourage\r\npublic instruction in all ways possible, permit newspapers subject\r\nto a liberal censure, to establish in Manila a college of medicine,\r\nsurgery, and pharmacy: in order to break down the barriers that divide\r\nthe races, and amalgamate them all into one. For that purpose, the\r\nSpaniards of the country, the Chinese mestizos, and the Filipinos\r\nshall be admitted with perfect equality as cadets of the military\r\ncorps; the personal-service tax shall be abolished, or an equal and\r\ngeneral tax shall be imposed, to which all the Spaniards shall be\r\nsubject. This last plan appears to me more advisable, as the poll-tax\r\nis already established, and it is not opportune to make a trial of\r\nnew taxes when it is a question of allowing the country to be governed\r\nby itself. Since the annual tribute is unequal, the average shall be\r\ntaken and shall be fixed, consequently, at fifteen or sixteen reals\r\nper whole tribute, or perhaps one peso fuerte annually from each\r\nadult tributary person. This regulation will produce an increase in\r\nthe revenue of 200,000 or 300,000 pesos fuertes, and this sum shall\r\nbe set aside to give the impulse for the amalgamation of the races,\r\nfavoring crossed marriages by means of dowries granted to the single\r\nwomen in the following manner. To a Chinese mestizo woman who marries\r\na Filipino shall be given 100 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries\r\na Chinese mestizo, 100 pesos; to a Chinese mestizo woman who marries\r\na Spaniard, 1,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Chinese\r\nmestizo, 2,000 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Spaniard,\r\n2,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Filipino chief, 3,000 or\r\n4,000 pesos. Some mestizo and Filipino alcaldes-mayor of the provinces\r\nshall be appointed. It shall be ordered that when a Filipino chief\r\ngoes to the house of a Spaniard, he shall seat himself as the latter's\r\nequal. In a word, by these and other means, the idea that they and\r\nthe Castilians are two kinds of distinct races shall be erased from\r\nthe minds of the natives, and the families shall become related by\r\nmarriage in such manner that when free of the Castilian dominion\r\nshould any exalted Filipinos try to expel or enslave our race, they\r\nwould find it so interlaced with their own that their plan would be\r\npractically impossible.\r\n\r\nAfter some years, when this population was sufficiently trimmed\r\noff, an assembly of deputies shall be formed from the people, in\r\norder that they may hold sessions in Manila for two or three months\r\nevery year. In those sessions they shall discuss public affairs,\r\nespecially those treating of taxes and budgets. Then after some time\r\nof such political education, our government may be withdrawn without\r\nfear, fixing before doing that the kind of government that is to be\r\nestablished--probably some constitutional form analogous to those of\r\nEurope, with a royal prince at its head chosen from among our infantes.\r\n\r\nMy task is concluded. Which of the two plans, above analyzed, it is\r\nthe most just or advisable to follow, does not concern me to recommend,\r\nmuch less propose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI will add, however, a page to express my opinion as an individual of\r\nthe Spanish nation. If I had to choose I would vote for the last. I\r\ncannot see what benefits we have had from the colonies: depopulation,\r\ndecadence in the arts, and the public debt, which come in great\r\nmeasure from them. The interest of a state consists, as I see it, in\r\nhaving a dense and well-educated population, and I do not speak only\r\nof literary or political education, but of that general education,\r\nwhich makes each one perfect in his trade, I mean in that education\r\nwhich constitutes a cabinet-maker, a weaver, a blacksmith, the best\r\ncabinet-maker, weaver, or blacksmith possible. The greater or less\r\nnumber of machines is, in our century, an almost sure thermometer by\r\nwhich to gage the power of empires.\r\n\r\nA colony cannot be useful except with the end of filling one of the\r\nfollowing three objects: to make of it a tributary country, for the\r\nincrease of the income of the mother-country (as Holland effects\r\nby means of a compulsory and exclusive system); to erect it into a\r\nsecond country, and a place of immigration of the surplus population\r\n(such as are especially Australia, Van Diemen's land and New Zealand);\r\nfinally to procure in it, a place wherein to expend the products\r\nof the national manufactures (as is the principal aim of the modern\r\ncolonial establishments). For the first, we have already seen that the\r\nFilipinas are a poor resource, and will be for a long time; and I shall\r\nnot wonder that before losing them, they will cost us, on the contrary,\r\nsome millions. As for the second, they are not necessary, for we have\r\nno surplus population to unload. And for the third they are useless,\r\nfor we ourselves have no manufactures to export. Barcelona, which has\r\nthe most factories in the Peninsula, does not have the least direct\r\ncommunication with the islands. All that is taken there from Cadiz\r\nconsists of a little paper, oil, and liquors. If it were not for the\r\ntobacco and the passengers who go and come, one or two vessels annually\r\nwould be enough to take care of all the mercantile speculations between\r\nboth countries. [Separation will not deprive Spain of a future rich\r\nmarket in the Philippines, as the case of the American colonies and\r\nEngland shows. Even if Spain should have a surplus population within a\r\ncentury, the Philippines will also have no lack of inhabitants, and it\r\nwill be necessary for the Spaniards to emigrate to the Marianas. Mas\r\nis not concerned by the argument that separation would mean the loss\r\nof the Christian religion in the islands. To the argument that the\r\nislands might fall into the hands of the British, French, Dutch,\r\nor Chinese, he asks why Spain should become a knight errant for all\r\nunprotected peoples. Spaniards in the islands can always return to\r\nSpain. People assert that since Spain has spent over 300,000,000 pesos\r\non the islands, it is but proper that that country be reimbursed;\r\nbut although it has also spent much on the holy land, it never expects\r\nany return therefor. Let the Filipinos pay heavier taxes under their\r\nown government; why is that any concern? Even if ninety per cent of\r\nthe population should desire to remain under Spain's domination, that\r\nis no sign that there may not be a better condition.] In conclusion,\r\nif we are conserving the islands for love of the islanders, we are\r\nlosing our time, and merit, for gratitude is sometimes met with\r\nin persons, but never can it be hoped for from peoples; and indeed\r\nthrough our love, why do we fall into an anomaly, such as combining\r\nour claim for liberty for ourselves, and our wish at the same time\r\nto impose our law on remote peoples? Why do we deny to others the\r\nbenefit which we desire for our fatherland? By these principles of\r\nuniversal morality and justice, and because I am persuaded that in the\r\nmidst of the political circumstances in which España is at present,\r\nthe condition of that colony will be neglected; that none of the\r\nmeasures which I propose for its conservation (this is my conviction)\r\nwill be adopted; and that it will emancipate itself violently with the\r\nloss of considerable property and many lives of European Spaniards and\r\nFilipinos: I think that it would be infinitely more easy, more useful,\r\nand more glorious for us to acquire the glory of the work by being the\r\nfirst to show generosity. Hence, the foreign authors who have unjustly\r\nprinted so many calumnies against our colonial governments, authors\r\nbelonging to nations who never satisfy their hunger for colonies,\r\nwould have to say at least this once: \"The Spaniards crossing new\r\nand remote seas, extended the domain of geography by discovering\r\nthe Filipinas Islands. They found anarchy and despotism there, and\r\nestablished order and justice. They encountered slavery and destroyed\r\nit, and imposed political equality. They ruled their inhabitants with\r\nlaws, and just laws. They christianized them, civilized them, defended\r\nthem from the Chinese, from Moro pirates, and from European aggressors;\r\nthey spent much gold on them, and then gave them liberty.\" [34]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTA'S REPORT, 1843\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunication from the intendant of the army and treasury [Intendente\r\nde Ejercito y Hacienda] of the Filipinas Islands, Don Juan Manuel de\r\nla Matta, [35] to the governor and captain-general of said islands,\r\nDon Marcelino Oraá, in regard to the moral condition of the country\r\nafter the insurrection of a portion of the troops of the third\r\nregiment of the line, which happened at daybreak of the twenty-first\r\nof last January; and declaration of the chief legislative reforms,\r\nand of the peremptory measures of precaution and security, demanded\r\nby said condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The recent disaffection of a portion of the Philippine troops\r\nhas caused the government to issue instructions in case of the\r\noccurrence of any excitement, insurrection, or alarm in the city\r\nof Manila and its environs. Matta, on receiving these instructions,\r\nhas transmitted secretly to the commander of the revenue guard [36]\r\n(whom he has advised in case of any danger to assemble all his command\r\nin the tobacco factory of Binondo) the portion of the instructions that\r\nconcerns him. Also the forces of the station of San Fernando are to be\r\nembarked on the boats in the river belonging to the revenue guard, and\r\nplaced in command of the port captain. In addition to the instructions\r\nabove cited, it seems advisable, \"considering the moral condition of\r\nthe country, to adopt radical measures to avoid the evil before having\r\nto punish it, thereby to shelter the colony from new seditions, which\r\ncannot be repeated without imminent risk of sad consequences.\" The\r\nsuppression of the attempts of the insurgents and the calming of\r\nManila was due to the loyalty of the artillerymen quartered at the\r\nfort of Santiago and the presence of other loyal troops.]\r\n\r\nThe sedition of Apolinario [37] in the province of Tayabas, at the\r\nend of October, 1841, and the insurrection of part of the third\r\nregiment of the line, which occurred in the capital at daybreak\r\nof January 21, [38] have in little more than one year placed these\r\nimportant possessions at the verge of a terrible civil war, and have\r\ncompromised great interests.\r\n\r\n[The discipline of the third regiment of the line before the\r\ninsurrection was poor, a fact that was attributed, among other\r\nthings, to the bad condition of the barracks. On the other hand,\r\na corps composed of native troops recruited from Manila and the\r\nneighboring places remained loyal, and was used to good effect\r\nin putting down the insurrection. In the opinion of many, native\r\ntroops officered by Spaniards (even to the sergeants and corporals)\r\nwould prevent disaffection in the future, and be much better than\r\nPeninsular troops. In this treatise it is Matta's purpose to set forth\r\n\"the measures by which the tranquillity of these inhabitants and\r\nthe conservation of this precious portion of the Spanish monarchy,\r\nwill be conserved in the future.\" The moral condition of the islands\r\nis most delicate and merits the close attention of the government,\r\n\"and most especially of your Excellency, to whom is chiefly confided\r\nthe tranquillity and conservation of these important possessions--which\r\nnow demand radical administrational and economic reforms that will\r\npermit the development of the wealth of their fertile soil, and\r\nthe welfare of all their inhabitants; and peremptory measures of\r\nforesight and security, which will render those advantages lasting,\r\nkeep the country loyal, and inalterably bind the union of the islands\r\nwith the mother-country.\" In consequence of the civil wars in Spain,\r\nthe Spanish government has been compelled to draw heavy sums against\r\nthe treasury of the Philippines, by which not only has the treasury\r\nbeen exhausted but a debt of more than four million pesos incurred--a\r\ndebt that cannot be met for years, \"both because the needs of the\r\ncolony are increasing annually, and because the remainder left\r\nfrom the revenues, after covering the ordinary obligations of the\r\nbudgets, is almost all spent in tobacco leaf, which is sent for the\r\nconsumption of the mother-country, in accordance with the orders of\r\nthe government.\" In regard to the military defense of the country,\r\nconditions are as bad. \"There are but few arms and they are in poor\r\nshape. The provinces are undefended. The army is composed almost\r\nexclusively of natives, and they are so few in number that the army\r\nis insufficient to defend the capital and fort of Cavite in case of\r\na foreign invasion.\" Indeed, in case of invasion it might be best to\r\nraze the fortifications built at the expense of so great sacrifices.]\r\n\r\nIn general there is to be seen considerable indifference, and even\r\ndisaffection, to Peninsular interests. Ideas of emancipation are\r\nsheltered in many bosoms. Discontent swarms in all places. It is\r\ngiven utterance with effrontery, and is developed and fomented\r\nin various manners. Since the beginning of the colony, boldness,\r\ndeceit, and acrimonious speech have had a foremost seat, but greed\r\nis today the dominant passion in the white people. Their needs are\r\nmany and there are few means of satisfying them. The hot climate\r\nespecially contributes to captiousness, and the development of vehement\r\npassions. A multitude of jealous, complaining, and evil-intentioned men\r\nfoment the discontent, to which also pusillanimous persons contribute\r\nby their indiscreet and excessive fear. Although by means of different\r\npassions, there is a manifest tendency to constantly discredit the\r\ndispositions of the government, to attack maliciously the authorities\r\nwho represent it, and to foment rivalry and discord among them, to\r\nwhich both the complexity of the legislation and the burning climate\r\nlend themselves. Thus all concur in weakening the prestige that\r\ngives force to the government. The malcontents have the necessary\r\ntime to gather new proselytes, to consolidate a faction against the\r\nmother-country, to prepare the will of the masses; and they await the\r\ntime and opportunity for the realization of their desires. This plan\r\nis not in writing, but is engraved in the hearts of those who direct\r\nit, shows itself by its works, and is the result of the tendency of\r\nthe age, of the calamitous circumstances in which the mother-country\r\nfinds itself, and of the kind of abandonment in which these important\r\npossessions are held.\r\n\r\n[Notwithstanding the royal order of April 25, 1837, prohibiting\r\npublications that might disturb public order and weaken the prestige\r\nof the government, such publications have circulated freely in Manila,\r\nthus increasing the discontent. In such publications the followers\r\nof Apolinario are called innocent, and the execution of the rebels\r\nin the camp of Alitao has been termed assassination. All things have\r\ncombined to destroy in Manila \"the prestige and moral force that have\r\nbeen hitherto the principal foundation of our domination.\"]\r\n\r\n[Although the provinces are not yet so greatly disaffected as is\r\nManila], their moral condition is very different from that when they\r\ngenerally pronounced against the English in 1762 and gave the victory\r\nto Anda. Mejico belonged to España, and its treasury contributed\r\nto the support of the islands, which had the exclusive benefit of a\r\ntraffic which the public especially valued, and whose conservation\r\nwas inseparable from union to the mother-country. North-American\r\nindependence and the French revolution had not yet come to fix the\r\nfuture destiny of all the colonial possessions of the world. [39]\r\nThe regular clergy, the principal base of our domination, then\r\nexercised an influence over the inhabitants, which time has almost\r\nentirely vitiated. Little care is taken for the instruction of their\r\nmembers, from which it results that some of them with their gross\r\nmanners, stupid pretensions, and exactions from the chiefs of the\r\nprovinces, and the gobernadorcillos and notables of the villages,\r\noccasion anger, quarrels, and discord which disturb the quiet of the\r\ninhabitants, distract and embarrass the authorities, and nourish those\r\nindiscreet and tenacious struggles in which all lose, and which have\r\ncontributed so greatly to the rapid undermining of the base of our\r\npower in the provinces. The mistrust of a sad future leads many of\r\nthem to engage in commercial business, and conduces to avarice and\r\nto a worldly life, so that they have lost their religious prestige,\r\nwithout gaining the respect and the consideration due to eminent and\r\nbeneficent citizens. Without doubt there are respectable men among the\r\nindividuals of the regular clergy, who, superior to circumstances,\r\ndevote themselves entirely to the fulfilment of the duties of\r\ntheir sacred ministry; who as true fathers of their parishioners,\r\nlook carefully after their comfort and welfare; and who, for that\r\nreason possessing their esteem, are, consequently, one of the chief\r\nsupports of the action of the government in the villages. It is with\r\nreference to these that I have remarked in another place that both\r\nreligion and policy recommend them. Let all be placed in the same\r\ncategory, and let strict watch be put on the instruction and conduct\r\nof the parish priests, in which, truly, there is much to correct;\r\nand the happiness of the provinces will be secure, if, in addition,\r\nthe improvements demanded by the state of civilization and of wealth\r\nin some of the provinces, and by the genius and circumstances of the\r\nvarious races inhabiting them, and the differences of the times in\r\nwhich we are living, are made in their government and administration.\r\n\r\nFor that purpose it must be kept in mind that ambition is wont to\r\naffect the Spanish people transplanted to these distant and hot climes;\r\nthat arrogant presumption is the distinctive characteristic of their\r\ndescendants; and we must consider duly the characteristic qualities\r\nof the natives.\r\n\r\nAs I have remarked to your Excellency on a different occasion, I\r\nconsider the moral picture of the Indian as very difficult to draw,\r\nfor frequently one finds united in him abjectness and ferocity,\r\ntimidity and a wonderful fearlessness and courage in danger,\r\nand indolent laziness and slovenliness combined with industry and\r\navaricious self-interest. It is impossible to represent exactly under\r\none single stroke all the phases of their contradictory character. But\r\nin general the Indian is pacific, superstitious, indolent, respectful\r\nto authority, heedless, distrustful, and deceitful. Dominated by his\r\nfirst sensations, and most fertile in expedients to extricate himself\r\nfrom difficulties, or to carry out his design at a moment's notice,\r\nhe must be considered as a minor who follows the dictates of his\r\nown will; and, as such, he must be directed for his own good, his\r\ndifficulties must be forestalled, corrected and punished. The natives\r\nare also spiteful and revengeful when they believe themselves offended;\r\nand at such times, hiding their ill-will under the veil of a deceitful\r\nhumility, they await the opportunity for satisfying it, and generally\r\ngive rein suddenly to their ill-will with perfidy and ferocity.\r\n\r\n[The contradictory character of the Filipino native explains the ease\r\nwith which a large province can be governed by one official with the\r\naid of the parish priests and two or three dozen soldiers; while, on\r\nthe other hand, the insurance companies of India refuse to stand the\r\nrisks of mutiny in a vessel employing half a dozen natives from Manila\r\nin its crew. The natives know no middle path between abject respect\r\nand insolent contempt, in their attitude toward the whites. In case\r\nof a foreign or internal war the governors or alcaldes-mayor of the\r\nprovinces would be the least capable of directing affairs, because\r\nof their ignorance of the native languages and customs, and because\r\nthey are in continual conflict with the natives over the collection of\r\nthe tribute, while at the same time they exercise a monopoly in trade.]\r\n\r\nFor a very long period the elements of discord among the authorities\r\nhave been numerous for lack of a special and analogous legislation,\r\nenacted with regard to the genius and circumstances of the various\r\npeoples inhabiting these islands and the enormous distance separating\r\nthem from the mother-country. During these latter years, there have\r\nbeen heaped up on this unfavorable foundation the elements emanating\r\nfrom the civil war which has covered the mother-country with mourning,\r\nand those of our own political dissensions; the development and\r\ntendencies of the revolutionary principles common to all the colonial\r\npossessions of the world, and which only force, supported by the\r\ninterest of self-preservation, is capable of restraining; and lastly\r\nthe impressions which it has been impossible to keep from transmission\r\nto the natives and other races, in proportion as the knowledge of our\r\nlanguage becomes general to them, and as they become civilized, and\r\ncontract our tastes and necessities through the increase of commerce\r\nand industry, and observe from anear the confusion resulting from\r\nour lack of harmony. This is, in my opinion, the chief cancer of this\r\nbody politic, and will finish it very speedily unless your Excellency,\r\nacting with the discretion and the energy so strongly charged in the\r\nlaws, and especially in the royal order of April 25, 1837, apply the\r\nremedy peremptorily demanded by our situation.\r\n\r\n[Discord and confusion and the spirit of resistance are rife throughout\r\nthe provinces. The events of 1820 and 1823, the sedition of Apolinario\r\nin October, 1841, and the mutiny of the troops, although different\r\nin their origin, all exhibit the \"perfidy and ferocity that always\r\naccompany movements of color in Ultramar.\" The prestige of the\r\ngovernment is weakened, which formerly was, with religion, the chief\r\nfoundation of Spanish domination. The political factions that have\r\narisen in the last six years, and which are now perfectly organized,\r\nare greatly to blame. The Peninsulars and Spanish Filipinos will\r\nend by destroying each other if the fitting remedy is not speedily\r\napplied. In a report made to the government after the sedition of\r\nApolinario had been put down, Matta said that the origin of the\r\nconfraternity consisted \"only in the character of the superstition\r\nwhich distinguishes these natives, who most readily believe whatever\r\nis presented to them under the veil of religion and of the marvellous;\r\nasserted that it became fanaticism as soon as measures were taken\r\nagainst Apolinario and his confreres, and that it became a declared\r\nsedition when the unfortunate Ortega attacked them in Ygsaban with more\r\nvalor than prudence; and that from that time presenting the appearance\r\nof a near insurrection in the neighboring provinces, it is to be\r\nfeared that it would have been converted into a revolution capable\r\nof compromising the conservation of these important possessions had\r\nnot the seditious ones been promptly defeated and severely punished\r\nin Alitao.\" Matta's report also said that probably Apolinario's\r\nexpulsion from the hospital of San Juan de Dios in Manila, and the\r\nmeasures taken against his associates, together with the suggestions\r\nof the adherents of independence, contributed to the holding of the\r\nnovena in Tayabas in spite of the precautions taken by the military\r\nand ecclesiastical authorities. These occurrences were principally\r\nthe effect of superstition and fanaticism; and although the ideas of\r\nemancipation have been present in the Philippines, as in all colonies\r\nsince the Spanish-American revolution, yet ideas of emancipation\r\nare limited in the islands to a few Spaniards who do not even form a\r\npolitical party, but only a crowd of complainers who are either not\r\ngovernment employees, or are employees who take it ill that Spaniards\r\nare sent from the Peninsula to fill offices that they believe belong\r\nproperly to themselves. [40] The ideas of emancipation have not yet\r\ncontaminated, nor will they in a long time contaminate the Chinese, the\r\nChinese mestizos, Spanish mestizos, or the natives, with the exception\r\nof a few of the \"secular clergy, as insignificant because of their\r\nignorance and few resources as by their lack of influence among their\r\ncountrymen.\" Whatever be the opinions of the influential Spaniards\r\nborn in the islands, they recognise that political upheavals would be\r\nas fatal to themselves as to the Peninsulars. In the insurrection of\r\nlast January, among the six white officers assassinated or wounded,\r\nthree of those killed and one wounded belonged to the revolting\r\nregiment, while the two remaining who were wounded were Europeans. The\r\nsafety of all lies in the stability of the government; but it must\r\nbe noted that events are daily more serious and that the discontent\r\nis spreading. Important reforms are necessary, but matters must be\r\nviewed only in the light of the public cause. \"Without virtues there\r\ncan be no prestige; and, without prestige, it will also be impossible\r\nfor the lesser part to dominate the great whole.\" The conservation\r\nof the islands depends on \"radical reforms in their legislation,\r\nand peremptory measures of precaution and security.\" Such reforms are:]\r\n\r\n1st. The formation of a special law for these islands, analogous\r\nand framed with reference to the genius and circumstances of the\r\nvarious peoples inhabiting them, and to their great distance from\r\nthe mother-country. [Matta believes in a law that will outline\r\nthe duties of the governor and captain-general, and place under\r\nhis general supervision real heads of the various departments of\r\ngovernment, who shall be responsible. A Colonial Council or Cabinet\r\nfor consultation on affairs of general public interest should also be\r\nformed. This separation of duties into specific classes, the heads\r\nof each department to be subordinate to the governor, in accordance\r\nwith law ii, título ii, book iii, will ensure the right use of the\r\ngoverning functions. To continue so many unconnected duties under\r\nthe governor will only add to the confusion.]\r\n\r\n2d. The improvement of the government and administration of the\r\nprovinces by organizing them with reference to their present state\r\nof civilization and wealth. For they cannot now, without serious\r\ninconveniences, without transcendental harm, have the government,\r\njudicial, military and revenue functions, together with commercial\r\noccupations and cares, united under one person alone. [The system of\r\nplacing one person in command of all these departments is opposed to\r\ncivilization and to the mercantile spirit that has penetrated into\r\nthe provinces. Civil governors should be appointed who should have\r\ncharge of the government, administration of justice, and the promotion\r\nof the welfare of the inhabitants. Such governors should have learned\r\nthe native tongue and should know something of the native manners and\r\ncustoms. The collection of tributes should not be entrusted to them,\r\nand their posts should be permanent, except for transfers, promotions,\r\nand suspension by the governor and captain-general, or sentence by\r\nthe suitable tribunal. This will give such provincial chiefs the\r\nnecessary prestige, in accordance with the royal order of December\r\n10, 1839. In the provinces, passion often takes the place of reason,\r\nand anything at all can be justified because of the facility with\r\nwhich the natives contradict and perjure themselves. The position of\r\nthe provincial chief demands that his authority be very vigorous and\r\nheld in respect. The native must be kept respectful by tact, justice,\r\npunishment, and energy. Jueces pesquisidores [41] and judges to take\r\nthe residencia should not be sent to the provinces, as that tends to\r\nweaken the authority of the provincial chief. Easy recourse can be\r\nhad in the provinces to the tribunals and superior authorities of the\r\nislands, while the natives and Chinese can appeal to their protectors,\r\nwho are generally very zealous in their behalf.]\r\n\r\n3rd. The suppression of the colleges of Santo Tomas, San Jose, [42]\r\nand San Juan de Letran of this capital, and the conciliar seminaries\r\nof the bishoprics, as perpetual nurseries of corruption, laziness, or\r\nsubversive ideas, as contrary to the quiet and welfare of the villages\r\nas to peninsular interests. [The suppression of the last three can be\r\nmade at once, and they should be replaced with schools of agriculture,\r\n[43] arts, [44] and commerce, which will conduce to the prosperity of\r\nthe colony. As regards Santo Tomas, inasmuch as immediate suppression\r\nwould anger the Spaniards and Chinese mestizos who have control of\r\nalmost all the capital of the islands, a new plan should be adopted by\r\nwhich desire to attend it would be gradually decreased until it can be\r\nsuppressed without any trouble. Sensible Spaniards generally believe\r\nthat the suppression of these institutions would conduce to the good\r\nof the islands and of Spain. From them come the swarms of ignorant\r\nand vicious secular priests, and the pettifogging lawyers, who stir\r\nup so much trouble among the natives, and cause the provincial chiefs\r\nso great inconvenience. Although not much attention is paid to this\r\nclass, they are the most vicious and worthless in the islands. Public\r\nconvenience demands the teaching of agriculture, the arts, and\r\ncommerce, instead of the theology and law to which the institutions\r\nabove mentioned are devoted. It should not be forgotten that the\r\nSpanish-American revolutions were fostered by curas and lawyers,\r\nwho since they know both the native language and Spanish, have great\r\ninfluence with the masses. The influence of the friar parish priests\r\nis now very much weakened, for they have almost entirely abandoned the\r\nspiritual administration to their native assistants. These assistants,\r\nby working on the superstitious character of the natives, can rouse\r\nthem to any act that will satisfy their own desires for vengeance.]\r\n\r\n4th. The eternal abolition of the sentences of residencia, to which,\r\nas governors, the captains-general of the provinces of Ultramar are\r\nstill subject. [These sentences have been of no use to the inhabitants\r\nof the islands, but on the contrary of great harm. Appeal lies to\r\nthe Audiencia from the judicial acts of the governor, and to the\r\nSpanish court from his purely administrational acts. The free press,\r\nin which all things are bruited, is also of great use. Communication\r\nwith Spain is now frequent. The governor and the chief of the treasury\r\nhave been divested of almost all governmental authority through the\r\nresidencia. The judicial and contentious have invaded everything\r\nand obscured the action of the provincial chiefs as well as the\r\nsuperintendent and intendant and the governor. The chief authorities\r\nof the islands need more energy and freer action.]\r\n\r\n5th. [The adoption of various other legislative and economic measures\r\nwhich Matta has before proposed to the government.]\r\n\r\n[Capitalists and workers are needed in the islands, but, in order\r\nto attract them, there must be governmental and administrational\r\nreforms. The natives must be considered and various reforms made\r\nconcerning them, and the heavy tribute on the Chinese must be\r\nreduced to not more than the twelve reals per annum for those\r\nengaging in agriculture. The public wealth of the islands must be\r\nincreased. Whites, Chinese, and mestizos must be encouraged to go\r\nto the islands in greater numbers, in order to correct the laziness\r\nof the natives, and, by their wealth and prestige, to offset the\r\nnumerical majority of the natives. The increase of consumers in\r\nthe islands will give a greater outlet to Spanish products from the\r\nPeninsula. The revenues must be increased in proportion to the public\r\nwealth, in order to sustain the increase of necessary forces.]\r\n\r\n[The reforms looking toward security and conservation which are\r\nurgently demanded by the moral condition of the country are as\r\nfollows:]\r\n\r\n1st. The reëstablishment of the well-organized military commission of\r\npolice, vigilance, and public safety. [This would be able to check\r\nall sorts of disorder and conspiracy. Its members should be paid by\r\nthe state, such pay to come from the licenses issued to travelers\r\ngoing to the interior, from licenses to carry arms, from fines,\r\nand from the fourth part of all contraband goods confiscated.]\r\n\r\n2d. The institution of night-watches in the city and villages outside\r\nits walls, which require them, as almost all the traders and a\r\nconsiderable portion of the white population live therein. [These\r\nnight-watches would relieve the troops of patrol duty in many\r\ninstances. They would be under the alcaldes-in-ordinary, and paid\r\nfrom the municipal funds.]\r\n\r\n3rd. The constant maintenance of a guard of at least one thousand\r\nEuropean troops. [These are necessary for the garrisoning of\r\nthe fort at Santiago, the palace, the Parián gate, and the other\r\nnecessary points. Matta's plan also calls for the reëstablishment\r\nof the Spanish guard of halberdiers of one hundred men, to act as\r\ninterior palace guard, and serve as a source of supply for sergeants\r\nfor the native regiments. He recommends the establishment of Tagálog\r\nacademies in order that the Spanish officers and sergeants may learn\r\nthe native language. [45] Certain privileges are proposed for the\r\nEuropean soldiers, whereby their pay may be greater than that of\r\nthe native soldiers, for their necessities are greater. The term\r\nof service in the Philippines ought to be eight years, as provided\r\nby royal order of July 26, 1836; but those who are fit ought to be\r\nallowed to reënlist and be transferred to the revenue guard [cuerpo\r\ndel resguardo], in order to save cost on transportation. Matta is\r\nagainst having fewer Europeans in the service as has been urged by\r\nmany persons of experience in the Philippines. The system outlined by\r\nhim is not one merely of military occupation, but looks to a close\r\nbond with the mother-country and to the industrial development of\r\nthe islands. Agriculture is the best occupation for the whites, and\r\nis in fact the only one that will give a good comfortable living. A\r\ngreater number of Europeans will mean a greater proportion of mestizos;\r\n[46] and if these, together with the Chinese and some of the whites,\r\nengage in agriculture they will throw their influence on the side\r\nof the government, because of self-interest. Exaggerated ideas are\r\nvoiced regarding the Peninsulars. They are never more dangerous\r\nthan during the first few years in the islands; but, as they become\r\naccustomed to the climate and learn to know the inhabitants, their\r\nideas moderate. Consequently, for this reason, and because of the\r\nexpense, Matta is against frequent reliefs of soldiers. Vacancies in\r\nthe ranks should always be filled with recruits from Spain, and never\r\nwith natives. Discipline must not be relaxed on the voyage from Spain;\r\nand the soldiers must be kept in good form physically. A special\r\nboat is recommended for the transport of soldiers to and from Spain;\r\nand cost of transport can be reduced.]\r\n\r\n4th. The completion of the organization of the valuable corps of\r\nthe revenue guards [cuerpo del resguardo]. [This can be done by\r\ncarrying out the royal order of October 18, 1837, and the three\r\nparts of the regulations drawn up by Matta's predecessor June 4,\r\n1841, the first two parts of which have already been approved. Matta\r\nhas endeavored without avail, and supported by various officials,\r\nto gain the governor's approval to the third part. The corps of the\r\nrevenue guards is always loyal to the governor. With the increase\r\nprovided in the plan for organization, this corps will be the most\r\nsuitable to defend the country either against foreign or internal\r\nfoes. Since the immediate object of the revenue guards is the custody,\r\ndefense, and guard of the revenues, they ought to depend immediately\r\non the treasury department, although they may be available when the\r\npublic safety demands it for any other duty. By a decree of Matta's\r\npredecessor, of April 25, 1839, the revenue guards of the various\r\ndepartments--those of the Bay, and of the tobacco and wine and liquor\r\nmonopoly revenues--were united into one corps. This extensive corps,\r\nwhich absorbs annually the sum of 191,589 pesos, has no adequate\r\norganization, a matter to which immediate attention should be given.]\r\n\r\n5th and last.

LEROY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"modern era\" in the Philippine Islands--which indeed, in certain\r\nrespects, did not really begin until after the establishment of\r\nAmerican rule--coincides roughly with the last half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. It is impossible to assign arbitrarily any date as precisely\r\nthat of its commencement. One will be inclined to lay stress upon this\r\nor that circumstance, and to choose this or that date, as he places\r\nimportance mostly upon matters connected with economic development,\r\nor with social progress, or with political reforms. The truth is that\r\nthere was advancement in all these lines, as also there were hindrances\r\nto progress in each of them, and that only by surveying it in each\r\nof these phases of its development can we come to understand in how\r\nconsiderable a degree Philippine society was remade during this period.\r\n\r\nLooking primarily at the expansion of trade and foreign relations,\r\nwe might date the new era in the Philippines from the opening of the\r\nSuez Canal in 1869. Yet that event, while greatly stimulating trade and\r\nagricultural development, did not inaugurate the modern era in that\r\nrespect. The presence of foreign traders, introducing agricultural\r\nmachinery and advancing money on crops, was the chief stimulus to\r\nthe opening of new areas of cultivation, the betterment of methods of\r\ntilling and preparing crops for the market, and the consequent growth\r\nof exports; indeed, one may almost say that certain American (United\r\nStates) and English trading houses nurtured the sugar and hemp crops of\r\nthe Philippines into existence. And their pioneer work in this respect\r\nwas done before the opening of the Suez Canal brought the Philippines\r\ninto vital touch with Europe by means of steam navigation--American\r\ninfluence being then, in fact, already on the wane. One might more\r\nreadily, from this point of view, assign importance as a date to 1856,\r\nwhen Iloilo (and soon after Sebú) was opened to foreign trade (hitherto\r\nconfined to one port of entry, Manila) and foreigners were permitted\r\nto open business houses outside of Manila and to trade and traffic\r\nin the provinces; or, even, to 1859, when the first steam sugar-mill\r\nwas set up in Negros island. But the entering wedge had been driven\r\nby foreign traders into Spain's policy of exclusion even before the\r\ncessation of the galleon-trade, the monopoly which confined Manila's\r\ntrade to a few Spaniards resident there and their backers in Mexico,\r\nwho saw in Manila only a depot of exchange for Chinese and other\r\nOriental commodities, and commonly despised the idea of giving any\r\nattention to the crude products of the Philippines or endeavoring\r\nto stimulate Philippine agriculture and exportation properly so\r\ncalled. From the date when this ruinous monopoly expired with the\r\noccupation by Mexican insurgents of Acapulco, the port to which the\r\ngalleons brought their silks, cottons, etc., attention was perforce\r\nturned upon Philippine products as a source of trade, and Philippine\r\nexports began to grow. [48] Spanish traders being too few, and utterly\r\nuntrained in the ways of competition, and Spanish ships being scarce in\r\nthe Orient, foreign traders and foreign ships gathered the bulk of the\r\nbusiness even in the face of useless and annoying restrictions, until\r\nfinally these foreigners had broken down the barriers sufficiently to\r\nenter and take a hand in actively fostering agricultural development\r\nin the Philippines. Hence, the opening of the Suez Canal only gave\r\na new turn and a great acceleration to a movement that, as regards\r\nPhilippine internal development, may more logically be dated from 1815,\r\nthe year of the last voyage of the galleon.\r\n\r\nIn one sense, indeed, the opening of the Suez Canal tended to lessen,\r\nrelatively, the influence of foreign business and banking houses in\r\nthe development of the Philippines, in that it led to direct steamship\r\nconnection with Spain, awakening interest at home in this hitherto\r\nneglected colony and bringing to the Philippines for the first time\r\nin three hundred years more than a mere handful of Spaniards. After\r\nthe early adventurers and encomenderos had disappeared, the number\r\nof Spanish civilians in private life was few indeed, numbering the\r\nfavored merchants who had shares in the galleon trade-monopoly, and an\r\noccasional planter, descended perhaps from a family of encomenderos\r\nrooted in the Philippines, or being an ex-army officer who had\r\nremained in the islands. Moreover, the small army maintained in the\r\nislands was to a considerable extent officered by Mexican creoles or\r\nhalf-castes, its soldiers being mostly Filipinos and Mexicans. The list\r\nof civilian officials was itself small, the governor (alcalde mayor) of\r\na province combining with his executive functions and (very commonly)\r\nhis command of the troops garrisoned therein, the powers of a superior\r\njudge for both civil and criminal jurisdictions. The members of the\r\nreligious orders constituted the largest numerically, as well as the\r\nmost influential, element of Spaniards in the Philippines. Outside\r\nof this class, the Spanish population of the archipelago, always\r\nvery small even in its total, was mostly gathered in a few places,\r\nManila containing by far the greater proportion. The general rule in\r\nthe provinces was that only one white man, the friar-curate, was to be\r\nfound in a town, a number of the smaller towns, moreover, not having\r\na friar-curate, but a Filipino secular priest. [49] The movement of\r\nSpaniards to the Philippines had, indeed, begun before the opening\r\nof the Suez Canal. The inauguration of the Spanish-Philippine Bank in\r\nManila in 1852 afforded evidence much less, however, of the growth of\r\nSpanish commercial interests than of a desire to foster the growth of\r\nsuch interests by supplying credit facilities more nearly up to date\r\nthan those hitherto available (at ruinous rates of interest) from the\r\nold \"pious funds\" [obras pías] of various sorts, especially since the\r\nforeign trading houses were virtually performing the functions of\r\nbanks in their ways of extending credit to agriculturists, or were\r\nbeing aided by private bankers associated with them. [50] The loss\r\nof Spain's colonies on the mainland, besides turning many loyal or\r\nproscribed Spaniards toward Cuba and the Peninsula, had in a small\r\ndegree encouraged such emigration to the more distant Philippines, and\r\nthe history of certain of the most prominent Spanish families in the\r\nPhilippines dates from the decades immediately following the political\r\nupheavals in Spanish-America. In the main, however, such immigrants\r\nas came to the Philippines in this way were government employees who,\r\nbeing ousted from the American continent, must rest as pensioners on\r\nthe home government if the latter could not find them places in the\r\nSpanish Antilles or the Philippines. Such immigration, it need not\r\nbe said, was not altogether an unmixed good; and some of the various\r\n\"administrative reforms\" designed for the Philippines in the fifties\r\nand sixties showed the influence of this pressure to provide places for\r\nofficeholders with a claim on the government. The number of Spaniards\r\nwho came to the Philippines on their private initiative was very small\r\nuntil direct steam communication with the Peninsula was opened, and\r\nthough it never became large during the last thirty years of Spanish\r\nrule, Spanish commercial interests in the islands gained relatively\r\non those of foreigners after the opening of the canal. A direct\r\nsteamship line from Barcelona was soon established under subsidy. The\r\ndomestic shipping laws of Spain were even more fully extended over\r\nthe Philippine archipelago, and the already existing preferential\r\ncustoms duties and regulations aided the growth of Spanish trade in\r\nthe islands thereafter more than they had done before. [51]\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Suez Canal and the entry of Spaniards into the\r\narchipelago in greater numbers marks an epoch even more in a social\r\nway than as respects trade and commerce. And the new social era then\r\ninaugurated was closely allied thenceforward with the discussion of\r\npolitical reforms, with the essay of some such reforms on the part\r\nof government, and finally with an organized Filipino propaganda for\r\ngreater social and political freedom. When the Spanish revolution\r\nof 1868 occurred the Philippines were still far remote from the\r\nmother-country, with its disturbing agitations, wherein violence and\r\nutopianism were destined to prepare the way for the reaction; the new\r\ngovernor-general sent out by the reformers who expelled Isabel II\r\ncame to Manila by the Cape of Good Hope, the old voyage which took\r\nfour months or more to bring even the news of what was going on in\r\nSpain. The Constitution of 1868 had been proclaimed in the Philippines\r\nbut a few months back when, early in 1870, the first steamer arrived\r\ndirect from Barcelona via Suez. Thenceforward, the capital of this\r\nremote Spanish outpost in the Orient was but one month distant from\r\nBarcelona for mail and passengers; soon after ocean cables to the\r\nports of China (eventually extended to Manila) put the Philippines\r\nin daily touch, as it were, with important occurrences in Spain. The\r\nold régime of slumbering exclusion, already breaking down under the\r\ninfluence of trade, was ended.\r\n\r\nThe influx of Spaniards from this time forward had in it, from\r\nthe first to the last, more of \"politics\" than of individual\r\ninitiative. More of them came out to take governmental positions than\r\nto engage in trade, or, less frequently, in agriculture, though many\r\nwho lost their places by changes in administration stayed in the\r\nislands and occupied themselves in private enterprises. It was the\r\n\"reformers\" of the revolutionary period in Spain who first undertook\r\nto make a \"clean sweep\" of the offices in the Philippines, putting in\r\ntheir friends. Administrative reforms, and to a considerable extent\r\na change of officials, was needed; but a more or less complicated\r\nbureaucracy was introduced along with some laudable reforms, and there\r\nwas then inaugurated the pernicious custom of changing the lower\r\nSpanish officials in the Philippines, as well as the higher, with\r\nevery change of administration in Spain--the \"dance and counter-dance\r\nof employees,\" as one writer has named it. [52]\r\n\r\nThere is undoubtedly some truth in the charge made by the defenders\r\nof the Philippine friars that the entry of Spaniards, especially\r\nofficeholders, during the latter part of the nineteenth century\r\nlowered the prestige of the Spanish name in the islands, and was\r\na cause (the friars would make it the chief or sole cause) of the\r\ndiscontent, eventually the rebellion, of the Filipinos. Administrative\r\nreforms, some of which were highly beneficial, such as the abolition\r\nof the tobacco monopoly [53] and the reorganization of provincial\r\ngovernments, nevertheless had the chief effect, in the eyes of\r\nthe Filipinos, of raising direct taxes and of burdening them with\r\nthe support of new sets of officeholders, whose presence was not\r\ninfrequently distasteful. By far too large a proportion of these\r\nofficeholders, who came out to an unhealthful clime to take places\r\nwhich were miserably paid and might be taken away from them in two\r\nor three years, were concerned rather with the \"pickings\" than with\r\nthe duties attached to their offices. Some were openly contemptuous\r\nof the natives, and thus helped to destroy the former good feeling\r\nbetween the races. The grievance of the friars was, however, far\r\nmore frequently vented upon a class of Spanish officeholders quite\r\ndifferent from those who gained odium through tyranny or corruption\r\nor both; the special hostility of the friars was visited upon their\r\ncountrymen who gained great popularity with the natives, because of\r\ntheir more democratic beliefs and manners. Such men were commonly of\r\nthe anti-clerical party in Spain, and the bitterest element in home\r\npolitics was thus transferred to the Philippines. One may recognize\r\nthat such men were all too commonly quixotic and indiscreet, as Spanish\r\nLiberals notoriously are. To refuse to kiss the friar's hand, and to\r\nspeak contemptuously of him and all his kind (perhaps even to stir up\r\nscandal against them), may have seemed to such men a very natural and\r\nproper method of asserting their political beliefs and their sense of\r\nindividual independence; yet the friars have rightly said that such\r\nactions, and the many things growing out of them, struck a blow at\r\nthe very foundations of the structure upon which Spanish supremacy\r\nhad been built in the islands. Hence it was that not infrequently\r\na more far-seeing Liberal, after some years of experience in the\r\nislands, would come out as a defender of the Philippine friars and\r\ntheir views as to the political régime to be maintained there; he\r\nwould perhaps explain it by saying that he was \"a Liberal at home,\r\nbut in the Philippines all ought to be Spaniards and only that.\"\r\n\r\nEven if we give full faith to the complaints of the friars' defenders\r\non this score--and their representations of the last half of the\r\nnineteenth century are very one-sided--even if we admire and accept\r\nas truthful the picture they draw of a sort of Eden in the Philippines\r\nback of 1860, and particularly in the two preceding centuries, wherein\r\nthe humble Filipino lived practically free of taxation, exempt from\r\nabuses from above, guileless of serious crime, and watched over by a\r\npaternal superior who directed his steps to the eternal bliss of the\r\nother world: still, accepting the friars' case at its face value, it is\r\nplain that they asked for and expected the impossible when they fought\r\nto perpetuate medieval conditions in a country opened to trade and\r\ncommerce and to modern thought and contact with the world at large. We\r\nmay doubt that ignorance was bliss even in the \"good old days;\" but it\r\nwas certain that those days must come to an end when the Philippines\r\nwere awakened by steamships, telegraph lines, newspapers, and books\r\n(even though under clerical and political censorship). Clear-sighted\r\nprophecy was that of Feodor Jagor, the German scientist who traveled\r\nthrough the Philippines just before 1860, and who, though he found\r\nmuch to praise in the old paternal régime, said:\r\n\r\n\"The old situation is no longer possible of maintenance, with the\r\nchanged conditions of the present time. The colony can no longer be\r\nshut off from the outside. Every facility in communication opens a\r\nbreach in the ancient system and necessarily leads to reforms of a\r\nliberal character. The more that foreign capital and foreign ideas\r\npenetrate there, the more they increase prosperity, intelligence,\r\nand self-esteem, making the existing evils the more intolerable.\" [54]\r\n\r\nThe echoes of Spanish partisanship and the talk of nineteenth-century\r\nreforms had been heard in the Philippines before the revolution of\r\n1868 and the opening of the Suez Canal, though it was only after these\r\nevents that the people generally began to be stirred, and then only\r\nin the most populous districts. Because the clerical influence was\r\nall-powerful anyway, and the whole fabric of Philippine government\r\nreposed upon it, Carlism was felt in the islands before 1850 rather\r\nas an influence in certain military mutinies and as a source of\r\nstrife between rival sets of civil officials than as involving\r\nprimarily a defense of ecclesiastical privilege. Foremost among the\r\nevents of the decade preceding the revolution of 1868 may be put the\r\nreturn of the Jesuits to the islands in 1859 (allowed by decree of\r\n1852) and the beginning of educational reform with the decrees of\r\n1863 ordering the establishment of a normal school and of primary\r\nschools under government control and supported directly by the local\r\ngovernments. [55] The Jesuits had already opened a secondary school\r\nin Manila, introducing for the first time something besides merely\r\ntheoretical instruction in natural sciences, and more modern methods\r\nof instruction generally. Their secondary school was subsidized by\r\nthe city government of Manila, their meteorological observatory was\r\nsubsidized by the insular government, which also employed them to\r\ninaugurate and conduct the new normal school. [56] From this time\r\nforward the Society was both directly and indirectly a stimulus\r\nto educational progress in the Philippines, was influential both\r\nin diffusing more generally primary instruction and in improving\r\nmethods and widening curriculums of higher instruction. In a large\r\ndegree, the educational program remained to the end of Spanish rule\r\na pretentious but most superficial thing, more sounding brass than\r\nsolid achievement. But we may fairly date a new epoch in this respect\r\nfrom the return of the Jesuits and the decrees of 1863.\r\n\r\nIn another way the return of the Jesuits is to be associated with the\r\nbeginning of a new era in the islands. They were not permitted to\r\nresume the parochial benefices which their order had held prior to\r\ntheir expulsion in 1768, but were to engage in missions in Mindanao\r\nand in educational and scientific work. Their resumption of the old\r\nmissions in Mindanao was accomplished at the expense of the order\r\nof Recollects, which was thereupon given the provision of certain\r\nparishes, including several wealthy parishes in Luzon, which had\r\nfor greater or less intervals been held by the more prominent and\r\nable of the secular priests, Filipinos of pure native blood or\r\nhalf-castes. [57] The cabildo of the Manila cathedral, including\r\nthe more notable of the secular priests, and the curates of the few\r\nconspicuous parishes (in central Luzon) which it fell to the lot of\r\nthe secular clergy to occupy, had come to regard these benefices\r\nas their property, in a \"corporate\" sense, as it were, quite as\r\neach religious order felt that certain parishes, or whole provinces\r\n\"belonged\" to it as an order. It is significant that here, for the\r\nfirst time, one notes a feeling of solidarity among the Filipino\r\nsecular clergy--for the demonstration of which feeling one has looked\r\nin vain, except in isolated cases, prior to that time, above all in\r\nconnection with the effort (1770) of the Spanish archbishop Santa\r\nJusta y Rufina, to secularize the parishes and displace the friars\r\nwith native priests. Only the bolder of the Filipino priests expressed\r\nthe complaints of their fellows, even now, and open talk of a campaign\r\nfor secularization of all the parishes was scarcely heard until some\r\ncourage was infused into these few and the small party of Filipino\r\nLiberals (mostly half-castes or Spaniards of Philippine birth) after\r\nthe revolution of 1868 and the arrival of a governor-general who\r\npermitted public demonstrations in behalf of Liberal reforms. From\r\nthe time of the execution of three Filipino priests for alleged\r\ncomplicity in the Cavite mutiny of 1872 [58]--the proofs of whose\r\nguilt the public has not seen, if the military courts which tried them\r\ndid--there was added to the campaign for the expulsion of the friars\r\n[59] on account of their landed estates and of their stifling of\r\nintellectual freedom the demand that Philippine parishes be entrusted\r\nto a native priesthood. Only since American occupation has the demand\r\nfor a national clergy found full expression, but it had for a quarter\r\nof a century before that been an important phase of the sentiment of\r\nnationality, a sentiment that was growing steadily, though slowly and\r\nin the main secretly until 1896 in the Tagálog provinces and 1898 in\r\nthe archipelago at large.\r\n\r\nThe reactionary party had partially regained the upper hand when\r\nthe mutiny occurred in Cavite in 1872. Instead of treating it as\r\nits comparative insignificance demanded, and as prudent statecraft\r\nwould have counseled, they employed it as an excuse for vengeful\r\nviolence, as a means for resuming full control of Philippine policy,\r\nand continued for twenty-five years thereafter to point to it as their\r\nmost useful \"horrible example,\" as an evidence of what must follow\r\nthe inauguration, even in the slightest degree, of a liberal policy\r\nin the government of the islands. Rightly or wrongly, the people of\r\nthat and the succeeding generation in the Tagálog provinces, and to a\r\nless degree in the others, were schooled in racial resentment through\r\nthe belief that the native priests had been done to death, upon a\r\npretext of manufactured evidence, by the malevolence of the friars. The\r\nproscription of the more conspicuous of the then small Liberal element\r\namong the Filipinos had consequences of no less importance. Those\r\nwho were sent into exile for alleged complicity in the Cavite mutiny\r\nwere certain conspicuous half-castes and a few Spaniards of Philippine\r\nbirth or of long residence in the islands. The native element proper\r\nwas for the moment scarcely affected, even in Manila and its environs;\r\nand no one has ever demonstrated that the few more advanced men of\r\nSpanish blood who were moved by the revolution in Spain to take a stand\r\nfor Liberal measures in the Philippines were engaged in anything but\r\nlegitimate political discussion, or indeed that they talked of going\r\nso far in this direction in the Philippines as had already been done\r\nin the Peninsula. These proscriptions powerfully stimulated the idea\r\nof a \"Filipino cause.\" Some of the exiles escaped to Hongkong, and\r\nthere founded a Filipino colony. Others settled eventually in Europe;\r\nthe more progressive and ambitious Filipinos began sending their\r\nsons to Madrid and Paris for education in contact with the thought\r\nof modern Europe; and in these capitals, and later in Japan, little\r\nFilipino colonies became centers of discussion of political reforms,\r\nand through letters, publications in the Liberal periodicals of Spain,\r\nand finally through their own books and periodicals of propaganda,\r\ngreatly influenced the growth of a public opinion in the backward\r\nsociety of the Philippines. Spanish Masonry gradually extended the\r\ncircle of its initiations and of its secret operations (necessarily\r\nsecret to an extraordinary degree) in the islands. At first only\r\nSpaniards had been admitted to a few lodges, then mestizos were\r\nadmitted, and finally natives of some degree of education without\r\nregard to race. In the eighties and nineties, there seems to be\r\nno doubt, a sort of independent Grand Lodge in Spain (asserted by\r\nsome to be of spurious Masonry), [60] managed by zealous Liberal\r\npropagandists with whom certain of the Filipino propagandists in\r\nBarcelona had associated themselves, directed the active organization\r\nof lodges in as many Filipino towns as contained favorable material,\r\nfor the purpose of fostering in the islands a demand for political\r\nreforms, of distributing the literature of the propaganda, and of\r\ncollecting funds to support the campaign in Spain for the extension of\r\ngreater social, political, and religious freedom to the Filipinos. The\r\nSpaniards associated with this movement were for the most part men\r\nof no standing and quixotic visionaries. Some of the Filipinos who\r\nfigured in the propaganda abroad were quite as unpractical, being\r\ninexperienced and excitable youths, full of jealousy of each other,\r\nwhile some few of them, moreover, misused the funds raised for them\r\nby their fellows at home. The whole program for \"assimilation\" of the\r\nPhilippines to Spain as a province of the Peninsula, giving a distant\r\narchipelago in the Orient with its widely different population, social\r\nstatus, and economic conditions and needs, a government just like that\r\nof European Spain was manifestly absurd and inimical to the interests\r\nof the Filipinos themselves, not to add that its realization was an\r\nutter impossibility. But these things should not have been allowed\r\nto hide the justice of the demand for such reforms and privileges\r\nas were practical and compatible with the needs and conditions of\r\nthe archipelago and its people: for a spokesman or spokesmen of the\r\nPhilippines in the Cortes at Madrid; for reforms in judiciary and\r\nfundamental laws, not blindly copied from those promulgated in Spain\r\nbut adapted to the Philippines, or if necessary especially drafted for\r\nthem; for administrative reforms, above all as to the civil service\r\nand looking toward an increasing recognition of the native element in\r\ngovernment, and toward a decentralization that should be gradually\r\nextended as far as deeply rooted habits and long-standing customs\r\nwould permit; and, finally, for greater individual and social freedom,\r\nboth in a political and a religious sense. This last was really the\r\ncrux of the whole situation, so far as the continuance of Spanish\r\nsovereignty should not come to depend purely on force. In the old\r\ndays it had rested on religious teachings, on the friars in fact,\r\nwith the sense of race-prestige in the background to support Spanish\r\nauthority. It was futile for the friars to cry out for a return\r\nto the old conditions, and to denounce as dangerous any reforms\r\nin the direction of freedom of thought or of speech; the pages of\r\nhistory could not be turned back. The idea of future independence\r\nfrom Spain was, to be sure, in the minds of some at least of the\r\nFilipino propagandists. But their present campaign was for greater\r\npolitical liberty, and the measures they advocated, and even the\r\nmethods they employed almost to the last, would have been legitimate\r\nin any free country--were, in fact, legitimate even then in the\r\nPeninsula itself, where they could advocate publicly what they\r\nmust whisper among their fellows at home. The very fact that such\r\norganizations as these spurious Masonic lodges were under the ban,\r\nand that even to be suspected of belonging thereto was to invite the\r\ndanger of deportation from home as a \"conspirator,\" is sufficient\r\nproof of the essential righteousness of the propagandists' cause. And\r\nthe campaign that began with a few Spanish-Filipinos in Manila and\r\ngradually extended to the more independent men of education in the\r\nprovinces eventually, under half-educated leaders of the small middle\r\nclass, reached in a perverted form the masses themselves, especially in\r\ncentral Luzon, and found expression at last in violence and an outburst\r\nof race-hatred. The Katipunan was not Masonic, as the friars asserted,\r\nonly copying some of the Masonic formulæ; but it was a natural and\r\nlogical outgrowth of the smothering of what had been a legitimate\r\nmovement for the expression of Filipino reform sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe title to these notes has indicated the year 1860 as marking in a\r\ngeneral way the opening of the modern era in the Philippines, without\r\nreference to any one particular event. It is proposed to give here,\r\nbriefly, such further notes as will afford a working bibliography on\r\nthis period, while calling attention to some subjects and certain\r\npoints that are commonly disregarded in the bibliographies and\r\npublished works dealing with the last years of Spanish rule in the\r\nPhilippines. No pretense to completeness is made. The aim is to call\r\nattention, under their proper heads, to the more distinctly useful\r\n(or, in some cases, the more unreliable, and hence to be avoided)\r\ntitles already listed in the Philippine bibliography that is to be most\r\nreadily obtained, and which is also the most complete and satisfactory\r\nwork of this sort, viz., that published at Washington in 1903; [61]\r\nand also to supplement these titles with others there unnoticed and\r\nwith other data not easily found. In the main, only such works are\r\ncited as the writer has himself consulted, though in some cases the\r\nnotes or recommendations of others have been followed.\r\n\r\nThe first essential to a study of this period is a fair and\r\ncomprehensive survey of Philippine conditions in the years just\r\npreceding--the \"old régime,\" as we may call it, though it was then\r\nbreaking down in certain particulars. One book alone will serve the\r\nstudent's purpose in this respect; and, whatever others are read,\r\nJagor's [62] is indispensable. Next to him, and in addition to the\r\ndocuments appearing in this series immediately preceding the present\r\nvolume may be cited the 1842 Informe of the Spanish diplomat in the\r\nOrient, Sinibaldo de Mas, and the two-volume treatise of 1846 by the\r\nFrenchman, J. Mallat. In certain respects, the latter has closely\r\nfollowed Mas; but his is no mere translated plagiarism, like that\r\nof John Bowring (1859), who was only a temporary visitor entertained\r\nby Spanish officialdom in Manila. The work of Paul de la Gironière,\r\nnot his Twenty Years in the Philippines, but his more serious work\r\nof 1855 (Aventures d'un gentilhomme breton aux îles Philippines),\r\nmerits attention as containing the observations of a cultivated\r\nforeigner who had the advantage of years of residence in Manila and\r\na neighboring province.\r\n\r\nAs was indicated at the beginning of these notes, to make a thorough\r\nstudy of this period, we should consider it under three heads,\r\nviz., economic development, social development, and political\r\ndevelopment. Not only has there been no comprehensive review of the\r\nperiod as a whole, but there exists no review of it under any one of\r\nthese heads, nor even any group of writings which can be offered to\r\nthe inquirer as covering the field of inquiry in any one of these\r\nrespects. For one thing, we must draw mainly upon Spanish sources\r\nof information, official and private, and rare indeed is the Spanish\r\nwriter who does not either proceed regardless of the economic point\r\nof view, or else give entirely secondary consideration to the vital\r\nmatter concerned in the economic and social progress of a people\r\nindependently of political forms and governmental influences. The\r\nresult is that Spanish writers, with them the Filipinos, and to a\r\ngreat extent the writers of Philippine treatises in other languages\r\n(drawing hastily upon Spanish sources), have over-emphasized the\r\npolitical history of this Philippine period. Of course, in Spain and\r\nthe Spanish countries long-standing habit makes it the tendency to look\r\nto government for everything, and to think of all amelioration of evils\r\nand all incitements to progress as coming from above; while social\r\nand economic conditions in the Philippines are such as to emphasize\r\nthis tendency, the aristocracy of wealth and education standing apart\r\nfrom the masses and being, to the latter, identified in the main with\r\nthe government, with the \"powers above.\" Nevertheless, it is to be\r\ninsisted that social and economic progress in the Philippines during\r\nthe last half-century should be considered separately and studied\r\nmore particularly than they have been thus far.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said, for another thing, that it is not possible\r\nto make an absolute separation of this subject under the headings\r\nthus indicated. Such a thing cannot be done with any people in any\r\nperiod of history. In this particular case, one need only mention the\r\nReligious Question, with its phases as a contest between friars and\r\nnative clergy, as a demand for modern freedom of thought and speech,\r\nand as an agrarian question, to show at once that matters social,\r\neconomic, and political are here interwoven. So also the Spanish\r\nadministration cannot be considered wholly apart from its bearing\r\nupon economic and social as well as purely political matters. No\r\nrigid classification is possible, but the student who approaches\r\nthe history of this period--which, apart from its own interest, has\r\nhad ever since 1898 the most vital bearing upon a public question of\r\ngreat importance in the United States today--will avoid confusion by\r\ngiving consideration to these separate points of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nOne would welcome an attempt by some one of the more ambitious\r\nFilipino writers and students whose attention has been occupied almost\r\nexclusively with political controversy to write the social history of\r\nhis people during this last period of Spanish rule. The materials for\r\nsuch a study, so far as they now exist in print, are very fragmentary,\r\nand the work could hardly be well done by any but a resident of the\r\nislands during that period. But few references need be given here,\r\nand the inquirer must derive most of his information on this line from\r\nthe numerous books and pamphlets whose object is primarily political\r\nquestions and from the economic and fiscal tables and studies which\r\nshed light upon the general status of the people.\r\n\r\nGeneral historical surveys of the period are lacking. Montero y\r\nVidal's three-volume history comes down only to 1873. And, though\r\nit is the best Philippine historical work for reference purposes,\r\nit is, after all, hardly more than a chronology of important events\r\nand compilation of official orders and projects, touching the life\r\nof the people scarcely at all. The same author's work of 1886, El\r\narchipiélago filipino, merits attention also in this connection,\r\nthough primarily it sets forth facts geographical, statistical,\r\netc. The works of Manuel Scheidnagel deserve also citation as those of\r\na Spanish official of long and varied experience in the Philippines,\r\nand as shedding, incidentally to the particular subjects which they\r\ntreat, light upon the conditions of country and people in general. [63]\r\n\r\nThe foreigners who traveled in the Philippines during this period, and\r\nwho have written thereon, were occupied in most cases with scientific\r\npursuits, and have confined themselves mainly to these objects in\r\nwhat they have published. The Luçon et Palaouan (Paris, 1887) of\r\nAlfred Marche touches upon the customs and conditions of the people\r\nin its record of six years' scientific research for the government of\r\nFrance. Edmond Plauchut's contributions to the Revue des deux mondes\r\nfor 1869 and 1877, in lighter vein and perhaps not always accurate,\r\nare, like Gironière's writings of earlier date, interesting as\r\npresenting the observations of a resident foreigner. Among the works in\r\nEnglish, revised or written since 1898 to meet the demand in the United\r\nStates for information about the Philippines, Dean C. Worcester's The\r\nPhilippine Islands and their People (New York, 1898), brings us nearest\r\nto the life of the people, particularly in the rural districts and\r\nregions most remote from modern changing influences. The treatises of\r\nthe British engineers and experts in tropical agriculture, Frederick\r\nH. Sawyer and John Foreman, are written by men who were, naturally,\r\nbest prepared to discuss the agricultural conditions and the material\r\nresources in general of the Philippines. Outside of these matters,\r\nexcept when reciting personal experiences and observations, both\r\nare compilers whose reading in Philippine bibliography has been very\r\nfragmentary. Foreman in particular has undertaken to cover the entire\r\nfield of Philippine history and politics, and has, to state the plain\r\ntruth, made a very bad botch of it. He has been so often quoted in\r\nthe United States as authority for erroneous statements that it is\r\ntime to make this fact clear. It is commonly impossible to draw the\r\nline in what he has written between fact and gossip, conjecture,\r\nor partial truth. His latest edition (1906) contains most of the old\r\nglaring errors or even worse omissions, with a full measure of new\r\nones in his recital of the history of events since 1896. Some data\r\ncontained in Foreman's book are not readily available to an American\r\nstudent outside of the large libraries; but a caution is to be uttered\r\nagainst relying upon him, even for his recital of fiscal details or\r\nfor his statistical tables. Sawyer is very much more accurate and\r\nreliable, just as he is less pretentious in the program of his work.\r\n\r\nIn studying the social process of the Filipino people from about 1860\r\nonward, the subject of education holds the first place. [64] It is,\r\nhowever, unnecessary to occupy ourselves here with the bibliography of\r\nthe subject, which has been very fully covered in VOLS. XLV and XLVI of\r\nthis work, the appendices to those volumes giving, in connection with\r\nother documents in this series and with the bibliographical notes,\r\nthe most comprehensive treatment of the subject of education in the\r\nPhilippines that is yet available in any language.\r\n\r\nAs we might expect from what has been said, the social life of the\r\nPhilippines, at least from about 1875, may best be studied in the\r\nperiodicals of Manila. In this connection it is only necessary to\r\nmention Retana's El periodismo filipino, which covers the subject\r\ndown to 1894. La Revista de Filipinas, edited by J. F. del Pan,\r\n1875-77, deserves special mention among the many periodicals of short\r\nlife. Among those of longer duration may be named El Diario de Manila,\r\nand also, for the closing years of Spanish rule, La Oceanía Española,\r\nLa Voz Española and El Comercio. [65] One should also consult these\r\nSpanish periodicals of Manila for the political history of these years,\r\nparticularly of 1896-98. It must be remarked, however, that, just as\r\nthese periodicals reflected mainly the life only of the capital, and\r\nthat quite exclusively from the Spanish viewpoint, so also they treated\r\npolitical and administrative matters not merely under the constraint\r\nof their editors' notions as to \"maintaining Spanish prestige\" but\r\nalso with a censorship in the background, maintained by and for the\r\npolitical and the ecclesiastical authorities. [66] Down to 1898 the\r\nPhilippine law of censorship of 1857, modeled on that of Spain in the\r\ndays of Isabel II, was in force, and it covered the publication of\r\nbooks and pamphlets of all sorts and of newspapers, the importation and\r\nsale of books, pictures, etc., and the regulation of theaters. [67]\r\nOne will, therefore, look almost in vain in these periodicals prior\r\nto 1898 for expressions of the Filipino point of view, or, till the\r\nclose of 1897, for any frank expression of liberal political views\r\non the part of Spanish editors. The few Manila periodicals started\r\nby Filipinos before 1898, usually printed in Spanish and Tagálog, had\r\nbut an ephemeral existence. [68] One must look for the expression of\r\nFilipino aims and ideas to the periodicals that have been published\r\nsince 1898; indeed, even the Spanish press of Manila has treated\r\nFilipino questions with freedom only since American occupation began.\r\n\r\nFor population statistics, all practical purposes are served by the\r\ntables and comparisons of the American census of 1903. [69] Here one\r\nmay find also the best data for reconstructing before his eyes the\r\nsocial and economic status of the Philippines and its inhabitants\r\nat the close of Spanish rule. The Spanish civil census of 1896 was\r\nunfortunately never published, nor completed in some provinces. The\r\ncivil census of 1887, though published in very condensed form,\r\nmerits attention. [70] Certain of the more notable statistical\r\nworks of private individuals will require notice in connection with\r\nagriculture, industry, and commerce; here the student may be referred\r\nto the Bibliography under the names of Agustín de la Cavada, J. F. del\r\nPan, and José Jimeno Agius. [71]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nUsing, as throughout these notes, the Bibliography as a starting\r\npoint, the student is referred to the first part of that work, viz.,\r\nthe List of the Library of Congress, under the headings Agriculture,\r\nCommerce, Finance, and Political and Social Economy; and to Pardo\r\nde Tavera's Biblioteca under the alphabetical lists of Aranceles,\r\nBalanzas, Boletín, Estatutos, Exposición, Guía, Instrucción, Memoria,\r\nand Reglamentos. Some of the works therein cited are obviously\r\nindispensable, and occasional biographical and bibliographical notes\r\nare also afforded, especially by Pardo de Tavera under the names of\r\nauthors cited, which will help in forming an opinion on the value of\r\ntheir works. [72] It is in point here to designate among these works\r\nthose most useful as references in a general way upon Philippine\r\neconomic matters, to add some not listed in the Bibliography, and\r\nto give some special references under the particular headings of\r\nAgriculture, Commerce, and Industry.\r\n\r\nGeneral.--Jagor's book, already noted as the best introduction to\r\nthe study of this period, is again mentioned here as affording data\r\non the tobacco monopoly (which lasted until 1884, before its affairs\r\nwere wound up), the attitude of the Spaniards toward the entry of\r\nforeign traders, and the part these foreigners played in developing the\r\nculture of abaká and sugar. Cavada's Historia geográfica, geológica\r\ny estadística de Filipinas (Manila, 1876) has a good arsenal of data\r\ndrawn chiefly from the civil statistical inquiries of 1870, though,\r\nlike almost all such works in Spanish, it is without a topical index\r\nand is put together in a disorderly manner most exasperating to the\r\nsearcher for facts or figures on a specific point of inquiry. Of the\r\nworks of José Jimeno y Agius, his Memoria sobre el desestanco del\r\ntabaco (Binondo, 1871) and Población y comercio de las islas Filipinas\r\n(Madrid, 1884) should be especially mentioned. Gregorio Sancianco y\r\nGoson's El progreso de Filipinas (Madrid, 1881), especially valuable on\r\nadministrative matters just prior to the revision of the fiscal régime\r\nin connection with the abolition of the government tobacco monopoly,\r\nhas also many data on land, commerce, and industry. Scattered through\r\nthe eight volumes of the fortnightly La Política de España en Filipinas\r\n(Madrid, 1891-98) are useful items on Philippine currency and exchange,\r\ntrade, etc., with occasional studies of these questions and those of\r\nChinese and European immigration, in most cases hasty, unreliable\r\npieces of work, often even fantastic for their utter disregard of\r\nthe fundamentals of political economy. Foreman's book has already\r\nbeen characterized; nevertheless, checked up with Sawyer's, it is of\r\nuse in this connection. Of the consular and other official reports,\r\nthose of the British Foreign Office [73] are the most valuable as a\r\nseries, though the comprehensive reports of the French Consul, M. de\r\nBérard, covering the years 1888-92, merit first place as individual\r\ntreatises. [74]\r\n\r\nThe testimony and memoranda presented before the American Peace\r\nCommission in Paris in 1898, together with some magazine articles\r\non the Philippines, form appendices to Senate Document no. 62, 55th\r\nCongress, 3rd session; only the memorandum of General F. V. Greene\r\n(pp. 404-440) and Max L. Tornow's Sketch of the Economic Conditions\r\nof the Philippines require any consideration in this connection. [75]\r\nThe reports on civil affairs (1899-1901) of the United States military\r\ngovernment in the Philippines and the reports of the Philippine\r\nCommission have much retrospective value in connection with the\r\nprevious economic and fiscal régime, and merit a general perusal in\r\nthat light; some of their more especially pertinent revelations will\r\nbe hereinafter cited. The Report on Certain Economic Questions in the\r\nEnglish and Dutch Colonies in the Orient (Washington, 1902) by Jeremiah\r\nW. Jenks, special commissioner of the United States government, is\r\nof course of comparative value primarily, but contains some general\r\nremarks on Philippine conditions as regards currency, labor, land, and\r\ntaxation. In many respects the best economic study ever made of the\r\nPhilippines is Victor S. Clark's Labor Conditions in the Philippines\r\n(Bulletin of the Bureau of Labor no. 58, Washington, May, 1905); though\r\ndiscussing the labor question, and that under American occupation,\r\nit has been written with a view constantly to past conditions in the\r\nPhilippines, social and political as well as economic. [76]\r\n\r\nAgriculture, Land, etc.--Beyond the general references given,\r\nno special work can be recommended on the subject of Philippine\r\nagriculture. The reports and bulletins of the present Philippine Bureau\r\nof Agriculture (1902 to date) shed much light incidentally on past\r\nconditions and methods of cultivation. Numerous official provisions\r\nand some private treatises on the Spanish land laws are cited by\r\nPardo de Tavera; but these remained for the most part dead letters,\r\nand for all practical purposes a little compilation in English [77]\r\nby the present Philippine Forestry Bureau suffices. In a report on\r\nthe establishment of land banks in the Philippines, José Cabezas de\r\nHerrera provided a historical review and abstract of landed property\r\nin those islands. [78] In connection with his arguments in behalf of\r\na tax on landed property as just and as also necessary in order to\r\nsupport a really efficient government in the Philippines, Sancianco\r\ny Goson gives considerable information on conditions of land tenure\r\nand cultivation down to 1881. [79]\r\n\r\nChinese.--Discussion of the Chinese in the Philippines is related more\r\nparticularly to questions of industry and retail trade. Nevertheless,\r\nthe Spanish government maintained almost to the end the theory--it was\r\nhardly more than an empty theory--that the Chinese immigration was\r\nbeing so regulated as to constitute a stimulus to agriculture. The\r\nsubject also falls into place here because, from about 1886, when\r\na campaign for the exclusion of the Chinese was started by Spanish\r\nmerchants and newspaper men, a program for fostering the immigration\r\nof Spaniards into the Philippines, and especially into the undeveloped\r\nareas of Mindanao and Palawan, was quite regularly coupled with the\r\narguments for Chinese exclusion. This program was usually presented\r\nwithout regard for the climatic and economic considerations involved;\r\nthat it was a \"patriotic\" scheme was sufficient for some of these\r\nwriters, who never stopped to ask themselves if their plans were\r\npractical. [80] Among the pamphlets on the Chinese in the Philippines\r\ncited by Pardo de Tavera, those of Del Pan and Jordana y Morera\r\ndeserve attention. A good survey of the subject, though not accurate\r\nin its statistics, is G. García Ageo's Memorandum on the Chinese in\r\nthe Philippines in Report of the Philippine Commission, 1900, ii,\r\npp. 432-445. [81]\r\n\r\nIndustries.--The general references already cited must be relied\r\nupon, and it is a rather wearisome task to uncover the data for a\r\nstudy of Philippine industries from statistical tables, treatises\r\nand pamphlets which have given the subject a cursory or fragmentary\r\ntreatment. The British and French consular reports may, however, be\r\nespecially remarked. Also, the reports of the Chief of the Bureau of\r\nInternal Revenue in the reports of the Philippine Commission since\r\n1904, when a new scheme of internal taxation was adopted, contain\r\nmuch information on industrial conditions, past and present.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommerce, Internal Trade, Navigation, etc.--The Spanish statistical\r\nannuals, tariff regulations, etc., are fully listed by the Library\r\nof Congress and Pardo de Tavera, under the headings above noted\r\nfor general references on economic matters. The most comprehensive\r\nsurvey of trade statistics, and one which almost serves the purpose\r\nby itself alone, is contained in the Monthly Summary of Commerce of\r\nthe Philippine Islands, for December, 1904, published at Washington by\r\nthe Bureau of Insular Affairs. It presents classified tables covering\r\nPhilippine imports and exports for the fifty years 1855-1904; they\r\nwere prepared from the best available Spanish trade statistics,\r\nreduced to terms of American gold currency at the average rate of\r\nexchange for each year, and, so far as the writer has checked these\r\nfigures, they are the most reliable that are presented anywhere. [82]\r\nAmong the very few Spanish writings, Azcárraga's Libertad de Comercio\r\n(Madrid, 1872) and Jimeno Agius's Población y comercio (1884) deserve\r\nspecial mention, also once more the useful little book of Sancianco y\r\nGoson, for brief but useful data for 1868-80 in its appendices. [83]\r\nFor 1891-98, La Política de España en Filipinas has some scattering\r\nfigures on trade and commerce, year by year, highly unsatisfactory for\r\nthe most part. Besides the general references upon the Spanish customs\r\ntariffs, one will find in Senate Document no. 134, 57th Congress,\r\n1st session (Washington, 1902), in its Exhibit D, a comparison of\r\nthe 1901 tariff with the Spanish tariff of 1891. [84]\r\n\r\nCurrency.--The List of the Library of Congress, under the heading\r\nFinance, cites a few Spanish and foreign treatises on Philippine\r\ncurrency prior to 1898, and the earlier American official reports\r\non the subject. One will get more enlightenment upon the actual\r\nconditions prevailing during the last years of Spanish rule from\r\nmemoranda and testimony in certain of these American reports than from\r\nany of the printed sources of date earlier than 1898. Nevertheless,\r\nthe petition of the Manila Chamber of Commerce in 1895 reproduced in\r\nLa Política de España en Filipinas, v, no. 105, brings out in part the\r\nhighly unsatisfactory conditions produced by the Spanish government's\r\ninaction and disregard of well-established economic principles. In\r\nibid., vii, p. 217, is given the text of the decree of April 17, 1897,\r\nproviding for the new Philippine silver peso which was beginning to\r\ncirculate in the islands when American arms intervened, and which\r\nwas proclaimed as a \"settlement\" of the Philippine currency evils,\r\nyet would obviously not have proved sufficient, unsupported as it was\r\nby provisions to sustain it in the face of the decline of silver. In\r\nmuch of the loose talk about economic depression in the Philippines\r\nsince the wars of 1896-98 and 1899-1901, not enough attention has\r\nbeen paid to the fact that \"hard times\" had really begun before,\r\nduring 1891-95 particularly, and that an unstable currency and\r\nexchange fluctuations had then played their part in producing these\r\nconditions; also that it was the Filipino laborer and small producer\r\nwho was especially mulcted of his due by conditions produced in part\r\nofficially and in part by governmental neglect. [85] In addition to\r\nthe American documents listed by the Library of Congress, reference\r\nshould be made, as regards currency and exchange evils before 1898,\r\nto the survey of the subject by the Schurman Commission (Report of\r\nthe Philippine Commission, 1900, i, pp. 142-149), and the testimony\r\nof Manila bankers and business men in the same report (vol. ii);\r\nto magazine articles by Charles A. Conant printed as appendices in\r\nReport of the Commission on International Exchange (Washington, 1903);\r\nand, for a few details on previous conditions, with exchange tables,\r\nto the reports of E. W. Kemmerer, Chief of the Division of Currency,\r\nfor 1904 and 1905. [86]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENT--SPANISH ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nOur object here being primarily the political progress of the Filipino\r\npeople, we are concerned incidentally, as it were, with the subject\r\nof Spanish administration considered by itself alone. A good study\r\nof that subject, be it said, is lacking, and it may be recommended\r\nas an opportunity worth improving.\r\n\r\nNo one who has read even a little about the Philippines and\r\nFilipinos need be told that it is necessary to trace the political\r\ndevelopment of this people along two lines--unfortunately, it proved\r\nfor Spain, lines that are divergent in considerable degree. Hence\r\nthe subdivision of this heading, regarding, first, development\r\nunder Spanish Administration and then the Filipino Propaganda,\r\nfirst of Reform and finally of Revolution. We are concerned in\r\nthe first instance, that is, with reforms and progress realized in\r\nconsequence of measures \"from above.\" It has already been said that\r\nvery considerable progress had been made by the Spanish government\r\nfrom about 1860 onward, and was being made when the Tagálogs\r\nappealed to arms in 1896. [87] It is also true that the stimulus\r\nto the Filipino reform propaganda came in considerable degree from\r\nthe movements toward betterment of the government itself, and from\r\nthe agitations for reform in Spanish home politics. [88] But the\r\ndevelopment of the Filipino people, social, political, and economic,\r\nproceeded at last more rapidly, or less haltingly at least, than the\r\nprogress in reform from above; the reform measures were only partial,\r\noften unpractical or ill-adapted to Philippine conditions; abuses\r\nof administration continued under so-called Liberal periods as well\r\nas in times of full clerical domination; in the action and reaction\r\nof Spanish politics, in which so often are party divisions merely\r\nnominal and superficial, the course of progress was so irregular and\r\nuncertain as to lend justification to the feeling of the Filipinos\r\nthat they were being treated with insincerity; and all the while,\r\nin the midst of bitter partisan and religious controversy, conducted\r\non both sides by writers most rabid and intemperate, the two peoples\r\nwere constantly growing apart from each other, and were losing the\r\nmutual good-feeling of past years which, though always superficial\r\nin large part (as in any such domination of one race by another),\r\nhad nevertheless had a foundation of genuine esteem.\r\n\r\nThe administrative organism.--For present purposes, it almost suffices\r\nto refer simply to the List of the Library of Congress under the\r\nheadings Finance, Law, Political and Social Economy, and to Pardo de\r\nTavera's Biblioteca under the names of authors cited in the above List\r\nand the alphabetical headings Aranceles, Balanza, Boletín, Colección,\r\nDisposiciones, Exposición, Guía, Memoria, Proyectos (those of 1870 for\r\nall sorts of reforms proposed after the Spanish Revolution of 1868),\r\nand Reglamentos. The bibliography of Colonization published by the\r\nLibrary of Congress, besides these special works on the Philippines,\r\nlists also works on Spanish colonies and works on colonization in\r\ngeneral. [89] Of the compilations, annuals, etc., listed in these\r\nbibliographies, special attention may be directed to those cited\r\nunder the names of Rodriguez San Pedro (to 1869) and Rodriguez Berriz\r\n(to 1888). The most complete reference work on Spanish legislation,\r\nexecutive regulations, etc., is the Colección legislativa de España,\r\nand this work contains provisions enacted at Madrid with regard to\r\nthe Philippines down to and including 1898. For the full official\r\nrecord, not only of enactments at Madrid, but of the forms under\r\nwhich these were carried into effect in the islands themselves, the\r\nPhilippine governmental regulations, proclamations, etc., covering\r\nthis entire period down to the end of Spanish rule, the official\r\ngazette of the Philippines (published under the name La Gaceta de\r\nManila, 1860-1898) is the final source; but the writer knows of no\r\nfull collection thereof in any library of the United States, though\r\nthere is of course one in the archives at Manila. In this connection,\r\nit should be remarked that the governor-general had very wide, and\r\nin some respects not very exactly prescribed, powers, one of the most\r\nindefinite and sweeping of which was that requiring any general law or\r\nspecial provision of Madrid, before it actually acquired force in the\r\nPhilippines, to be published with the governor-general's \"cúmplase\"\r\n(\"let it go into effect\"). This might be, and usually was, a mere\r\nformality; but it was capable of being used so as at least to postpone\r\nthe execution of a legislative decree or ministerial order which was\r\ndistasteful to the chief authority of the Philippines, was violently\r\nopposed by the influential interests in the islands (particularly the\r\necclesiastical element), or, as happened in some cases, was manifestly\r\ninapplicable to Philippine conditions. Of course, the governor-general\r\ncould readily be overruled, but even so, he could, if he desired,\r\nsecure thus a delay and possible reconsideration of the matter,\r\nand the frequent changes of party administration in Spain encouraged\r\ndelays of this and like sorts, not a few reform decrees remaining thus\r\ndead letters in the Philippines. It is often important, therefore,\r\nto discover not only what was the law or regulation provided for the\r\nPhilippines in Madrid, but how it was put into force in the islands,\r\nor if it actually took effect at all. For this purpose, the Official\r\nGuide of the Philippines (Guía de forasteros to 1865, Guía oficial\r\nfrom 1879 to 1898) supplements in some respects the official gazette\r\nand the collection of Rodriguez Berriz. [90]\r\n\r\nOf surveys and summaries of Spanish administration in the Philippines\r\nlisted in the Bibliography may be mentioned Cabezas de Herrera's\r\nApuntes (1883) and Fabié's Ensayo histórico (Madrid, 1896), also\r\nJosé de la Rosa's La administración pública en Filipinas. [91] In the\r\ncompilation by Jesuit fathers published at Washington in 1900 under\r\nthe title El archipiélago filipino, there is to be found in vol. i,\r\na survey of the governmental organization and the various activities\r\nof the government both under civil and ecclesiastical control. This\r\nis reproduced in English in vol. iv of Report of the Philippine\r\nCommission, 1900. In vol. i of this report of the Schurman Commission\r\n(part iv, chapter i, also pp. 122-123) is an abstract of the Spanish\r\nsystem of government which, so far as the framework of that government\r\nis concerned, serves the purpose for one who can not readily consult\r\nthe Spanish official sources from which it was drawn. [92] The major\r\nportion of this abstract is occupied by a translation and summary of\r\nthe law reforming the Philippine local governments in 1893, commonly\r\ncalled the \"Maura Law\" after the Colonial Minister who promulgated\r\nit. [93] As put in force by Governor-General Blanco, however, it was\r\nsomewhat altered and revised, and many of its more promising provisions\r\nfor local autonomy had in most towns remained in reality dead letters\r\nup to the time when revolt broke out in the Tagálog provinces in\r\n1896; elections under the new law were suspended, and martial law\r\nestablished. For this law in its original text and as promulgated\r\nby Blanco, with regulations and model forms for the municipalities,\r\nsee Felix M. Roxas's Comentarios al reglamento provisional de las\r\njuntas provinciales (Manila, 1894). [94]\r\n\r\nThe administration in actual operation.--What most interests us is the\r\nactual working of this machine in Manila, the provinces and towns, and\r\nthe works above cited will mostly provide for us only its skeleton on\r\npaper. To make it an effective machine, we must resort to personal\r\ntestimony, occasional revelations thrown upon it by such of our\r\nwriters as looked beyond mere routine, and perhaps most of all to the\r\nperiodical literature of the times. [95] Few of the resident writers\r\nof the old régime thought it was quite patriotic, or would serve their\r\npersonal interests, to discuss matters as frankly, for example, as\r\ndid Sancianco y Goson. [96] Testimony before the Schurman Commission\r\n(vol. ii of its report) in 1899 brings out, here and there, revelations\r\nas to how the former government was actually administered. [97]\r\nPhilippine government reports under American rule bring to light here\r\nand there revelations about the former administration, especially in\r\nfiscal and judicial matters. The customs collections benefited the\r\ntreasury far less than they should have done; perhaps fully as much\r\nas was turned in was \"absorbed\" in one way and another. [98] Special\r\nsurtaxes on the customs and port dues were collected at Manila for\r\nthe improvement of its harbor from 1880 to 1898, amounting during the\r\nlast five years alone to 3,500,000 pesos. Yet the work, when at last\r\ninaugurated, dragged along in desultory fashion and the value of the\r\nbreakwater constructed and the equipment in hand in 1898 amounted to\r\nno more than $1,000,000 gold. [99]\r\n\r\nTaxation.--No one of the works on administration just cited treats\r\nthis subject in a comprehensive or satisfactory manner. The only\r\nspecial study of the subject that is known to the writer is Carl\r\nC. Plehn's Taxation in the Philippines (Political Science Quarterly,\r\nxvi, pp. 680-711, and xvii, pp. 125-148), and the author of this\r\nexcellent survey had to drag his data forth from the official records\r\nand compilations. This survey gives all the most necessary information\r\nas to kinds of taxes, their incidence, and amounts; but for the most\r\npart there lie outside of its scope the questions one wishes to have\r\nanswered as to methods of collection and the working of the fiscal\r\nadministration in general, the actual receipts and expenditures for\r\ngovernment purposes, and particularly the special local revenues\r\nso far as separate from general revenues. Sancianco y Goson again\r\nhelps to fill the gap, as regards the system of taxation prevailing\r\nbefore the abolition of the tobacco monopoly and the reform of the\r\ntribute and the corvee in 1884. [100] Anyone who has had experience\r\nwith Spanish fiscal tables need not be told that they do not always\r\nshow what they appear to show. It is thus that the writers who have\r\nreproduced in English since 1898 Philippine budgets for various years\r\n[101] have unwittingly misled their readers as to the real cost of\r\ngovernment under Spain. The figures shown in these budgets were the\r\ntotals of net collections (and expenditures), for ordinary purposes,\r\nfor the central government of the islands alone. They did not include\r\nthe purely local licenses and other taxes, the surcharges on general\r\ntaxes for local government (to be expended under supervision of the\r\ncentral authorities), the percentages that went to collectors, the\r\nother fees forming part or all of the compensation of some judicial and\r\nother officials, special surcharges for port works and other purposes\r\nnot covered in the ordinary budget, etc. Naturally, no estimate was\r\nincluded of the value of the forced-labor levy. The products of\r\n\"squeeze\" and \"pickings,\" in some cases so fully established as\r\nto be notorious, were of course not included; nevertheless, they\r\nrepresented part of the cost of government to the people. Finally,\r\nan ecclesiastical establishment, really a part of the government\r\nitself, drew support from the people in many ways beyond what would\r\nhave been provided had not the power of government been behind it,\r\nunder a system of voluntary contributions, for instance, apart from\r\nthe communities which paid rent to the friars as landlords. [102]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish-Philippine debt of 40,000,000 pesos, incurred in 1897 in\r\nconsequence of the insurrection, has not had sufficient notice as\r\nbeing originally the cause at Paris of the payment of $20,000,000\r\nby the United States to Spain in connection with the clause of the\r\ntreaty providing for the cession of the Philippines. Had the islands\r\nremained under Spanish sovereignty, they would have carried this\r\ntheir first public debt, expended wholly for war purposes, part of\r\nit being loaned for the payment of military operations in Cuba. [103]\r\n\r\nLegal and judicial.--In the introduction to the List of the Library of\r\nCongress, under the heading Law, and on the pages of the List cited in\r\nthat note will be found the formal bibliography of the subject. [104]\r\nSome references upon the actual conditions of the administration of\r\njustice in the Philippines have already been given. For this purpose,\r\nnote also a comparison of the old criminal procedure with that\r\nintroduced in 1899 in Military Governor on Civil Affairs (Rept. War\r\nDept., 1900, i, part 10), pp. 17-20. The compilation of Rafael Morales\r\ny Prieto [105] is also to be specially mentioned for the criminal\r\nlaw and procedure, 1880 to 1894, and also for an appendix containing\r\ncirculars as to judicial fees of various sorts. For brief summaries in\r\nEnglish of the old judicial organizations see Exhibit J of the Report\r\nof the Taft Philippine Commission, 1900, a résumé by Chief Justice\r\nArellano, especially for a statement as to the conflict of laws and\r\ncodes, old and new, and as to the relative degree of authority of\r\nthese codes; and Census of the Philippine Islands (Washington, 1905),\r\nchapter on the Judiciary. [106] Justice Willard's brief Notes on the\r\nSpanish Civil Code (Manila, 1903) also merits consultation.\r\n\r\nScience and material resources.--So far as the scientific work of\r\nthe period has a direct bearing upon our present purposes, it relates\r\nrather to the section on Economic Development. But the materials are\r\nsufficiently listed in the Bibliography, and the subject is introduced\r\nhere only to say that this is one of the lines along which, in recent\r\nyears, Spanish administration was beginning to make progress. This\r\nwas true, however, chiefly of forestry and mineralogy, and was due\r\nalmost entirely to the Spanish officials Abella y Casariego, Centeno y\r\nGarcía, and Sebastian Vidal y Soler, and to the stimulus of the work of\r\nforeign investigators, especially Germans. The work of the Jesuits in\r\nmeteorology should also be specially mentioned. It will be noted that\r\nlittle headway was made in the matter most vital for the Philippines,\r\nviz., agriculture; nor can we say that even a beginning was made in\r\nindustrial chemistry or other researches calculated to foster either\r\nincipient or undeveloped industries, while the public health service\r\nwas lamentably defective and scientific research relating thereto\r\namounted practically to nothing. Reference may be made to the already\r\nlarge list of publications of the present Philippine government's\r\nBureau of Science, Board of Health, Agriculture, Forestry, and Mining\r\nbureaus as showing the state of scientific investigation before 1898,\r\nalso for bibliographical data. [107]\r\n\r\nMoros and pagan peoples.--Ethnology as a science does not claim a\r\nplace here. [108] We are concerned with the Spanish advance toward\r\nthe establishment of effective control over large areas either partly\r\noccupied or kept in a wild state of nature by backward or warring\r\ntribes; though considerable headway was made in the last half of the\r\nnineteenth century, Spanish sovereignty over these areas was after\r\nall only nominal in 1898. Moreover, especially as regards the Moros,\r\nthe materials and bibliography have been presented in other volumes\r\nof this series. [109] Attention is called to a useful compilation of\r\nSpanish campaigns against the Moros by Lieut. W. E. W. McKinley, [110]\r\nespecially for its reviews of Malcampo's campaign of 1876, Terrero's\r\nof 1886-87, Weyler's of 1888-91, and Blanco's of 1894-96. [111]\r\nThe American military reports from 1899 to date and reports on the\r\nMoro Province since 1903 contain scattered data on Spanish relations\r\nwith the Moros and also the hill tribes of Mindanao. Similarly, the\r\nreports and publications of the Philippine Ethnological Survey from\r\n1902 to date contain references to Spanish contact in recent years\r\nwith the pagan peoples of Luzón, Mindoro, and Palawan. [112]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENT--FILIPINO PROPAGANDA AND REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nReligious Question.--It need scarcely be repeated that the \"friar\r\ncontroversy\" enters not only into this, but every phase of our\r\ndiscussion, and in one form or another, is touched upon in almost\r\nall our sources of information about the Philippines. For one thing,\r\nhowever, we are not here concerned with a historical judgment upon\r\nthe work of the friars in the Philippines, though it is proper to\r\nnote that there has of late been evident a reaction in their favor\r\nfrom the tendency common in the United States immediately after 1898\r\nto judge them wholly by recent events, and their work is now more\r\nfairly viewed in its three-century perspective. We are, moreover,\r\nexcused from entering upon a comprehensive survey of literature about\r\nthe friars and their work in general by the fact that the subject has\r\nbeen constantly to the fore throughout this series. What is needed\r\nhere is only the citation, supplementary to the Bibliography and to\r\nthe great accumulation of bibliographical references in other volumes\r\nof this series, of certain titles easily overlooked (some because of\r\nrecent publication) and of such special passages in all these works\r\nas elucidate particular matters of importance.\r\n\r\nAs with all the political literature of the Philippines, 1860-1898, the\r\nreader is to be warned against the exaggerations of both sides. Always\r\nand everywhere, religious privileges and prejudices have aroused\r\ndiscussion both violent and intolerant; and in this case we find,\r\non one side, a defense of religious and ecclesiastical privileges of\r\na medieval character and in a tone and temper inherited from those\r\ntimes. Nor, even setting the purely ecclesiastical and religious\r\nquestions aside, need we expect to find in this literature any\r\nreview or discussion written in a calm and scientific spirit. Spanish\r\npolitical literature is almost entirely polemic, and Spanish polemics\r\nis sui generis. So, as with the friars and their defenders, we\r\nfind here the principles of modern political science, which appeal\r\nproperly to cool reason and the tolerance of liberalism, put forward\r\nby Spaniards and Filipinos in a language and with a spirit that hark\r\nback to times which we have come to think of as far remote from ours.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of tone, the intolerance and contempt of the Filipino,\r\nand the flaunting of \"race superiority,\" which came to characterize\r\nthe writings of the friars and their defenders in this period--and\r\nwhich played no small part in leading the Filipinos to the brink of\r\nseparation--are shown to the full in the numbers of La Política de\r\nEspaña en Filipinas, 1891-98. The purpose of this organ was to combat\r\nin Spain the program of those who would further liberalize the régime\r\nof society and government in the Philippines. W. E. Retana, at first an\r\nassociate editor with José Feced, was after 1895 its sole editor. Just\r\nwhat were the relations of the Madrid establishments of the Philippine\r\nreligious orders with the business department of this periodical is not\r\nknown; but it is admitted that \"the friars helped by subscriptions\"\r\nat least, and it has generally been supposed that their connection\r\nwith it was really closer, in short that it was practically an organ\r\nof theirs. [113] In it will be found the pro-friar and anti-liberal\r\naccount and view of events and matters current during the years of its\r\npublication, and also various studies of earlier years written from\r\nthe same point of view. The case for the friars, especially for the\r\nperiod from 1863 on, may also be found quite typically set forth in\r\na single volume of five hundred pages by a Philippine Augustinian,\r\nPadre Eladio Zamora (Las corporaciones religiosas en Filipinas,\r\nValladolid, 1901). [114] Testimony given before Hon. William H. Taft\r\nin 1900 regarding the friars and their part in the old régime, by the\r\nSpanish archbishop and heads of the orders themselves as well as by\r\nFilipinos on the other side will be found in Senate Document no. 190,\r\n56th Congress, 2nd session.\r\n\r\nFriars' Estates.--The above document, which is entitled Lands\r\nheld for ecclesiastical or religious uses in the Philippines, also\r\ngives information on the friars' rural estates. One will find no\r\ncomprehensive treatment of this subject before 1898, though it is\r\nusually touched upon, often with great inaccuracy, in the anti-friar\r\npamphlets. For further data upon the subject in American official\r\nreports, see: Report of War Department, 1900, i, part 4, pp. 502-508\r\n(General Otis); Report of Taft Philippine Commission, 1900, pp. 23-33;\r\nibid., 1903, i, Exhibits F, G, H, and I; ibid., 1904, i, Exhibit I\r\n(Report on Examination of Titles to Friars' Estates); and Report of\r\nSecretary of War, 1902, appendix O (Rome negotiations of 1902). [115]\r\n\r\nThe Filipino clergy and their Cause.--Contests between secular and\r\nregular ecclesiastics, and over the subjection of friar-curates to\r\nordinary jurisdiction had filled many pages of Philippine history\r\nin every century. But, when revived under somewhat new forms from\r\nabout 1863 on, as remarked in the introduction to these notes, they\r\nspeedily assumed a new and rather distinct phase. The introduction\r\nhas noted the connection of the Jesuits' return with the encroachment\r\nupon the Filipino secular priests and with the counter demand for the\r\nbelated subjection of the friar-parishes to the ordinary ecclesiastical\r\nlegislation and jurisdiction of the Church; under the encouragement\r\nof the 1868 revolution in Spain, these demands grew apace from 1868\r\nto 1872, and became interlaced with strictly political demands,\r\nuntil finally we may regard the cause of the Filipino clergy as a\r\npart of the campaign for Filipino nationalism. The reaction of 1872\r\nand immediately subsequent years checked it, and it has found full\r\nexpression only since Spanish sovereignty was overthrown; but it is\r\nbest considered in its broadest scope, as a part of the Filipino\r\nmovement toward nationality, though it may have been but dimly or\r\nnot at all felt as such by some of its most active protagonists.\r\n\r\nFor the documents showing what was the modern phase of the question\r\nregarding parishes in its beginnings, see the pamphlets cited in the\r\nList of the Library of Congress under Agu[a]do (p. 64), and in Pardo\r\nde Tavera's Biblioteca under the same name and numbers 681, 873,\r\n1,348 and 1,962. [116] We must come down to the period of American\r\nrule for full statements of the case of the Filipino clergy against\r\nthe friars. A Spanish cleric, formerly an Augustinian friar-curate,\r\nwho was excloistered on his own petition some time before the end\r\nof Spanish rule and has since continued to reside in the islands,\r\nhas been the chief spokesman for the Filipino clergy. He is Salvador\r\nPons y Torres, and, apart from frequent contributions on the subject\r\nto the press of Manila since 1898 and various pamphlets, he undertook\r\nto review the entire subject in his Defensa del clero filipino and\r\nits supplement El clero secular filipino, both published at Manila\r\nin 1900; while in connection with the visit of Delegate Chapelle, a\r\ncampaign was being conducted for fuller recognition of the Filipino\r\nclergy by the Vatican. [117] Their claims are set forth in Memorial\r\nelevado á Sa Santidad El Papa León XIII por el Pueblo Filipino (Manila,\r\n1900). [118] For the full exposition of the question, one must study\r\nit under the Filipino revolution against the United States and in\r\nthe history of the Aglipay schism since 1903. [119]\r\n\r\nRevolt of 1872.--That the chief victims of this episode were prominent\r\nFilipino priests connects it rather with religio-political than with\r\npurely political matters. The civilians who were arrested for too great\r\nactivity in agitating for political privileges were deported to Guam,\r\nwhence their escape to foreign ports was perhaps winked at, while after\r\na time some of them returned to the Philippines. [120] But the three\r\nmost prominent priests who were tried for complicity in the mutiny\r\nat Cavite (Burgos, a Spanish-Filipino, Zamora, a Chinese-Filipino,\r\nand Gomez, a pure-blooded Filipino) were condemned to death by a\r\nvery speedily summoned court-martial and were promptly executed. If\r\nwe had the record of the proofs submitted before this court-martial\r\n(which acted very summarily and under pressure of official and other\r\ndemonstrations of indignation, not to say vindictiveness), and the\r\nstatement of its conclusions, we should be in better position to judge\r\nwhether or not a great injustice was done. But neither officially\r\nnor semi-officially was the guilt of the condemned ever shown, and we\r\nhave either to accept very vehement and intemperate assertions about\r\nit having been proved, or to incline to the belief that these men\r\nwere struck down by a power which stretched out its hand in the dark,\r\nand that their death was a punishment for having ventured under the\r\npreceding Liberal administrations to advocate the withdrawal of the\r\nfriars as curates of parishes. Certainly this became the belief of\r\nthe Filipino people, propagated from year to year by word of mouth\r\n(acquiring thus exaggerated and distorted details as being of sober\r\ntruth), and occasionally finding expression in print. [121] The usually\r\nsober and colorless Montero y Vidal becomes very rabid in his recital\r\nof this episode in Philippine history and is very positive not only\r\nin denouncing the priests who were executed and the deportees as\r\nguilty but in proclaiming their movement as actually separatist\r\nin character. He ridicules at length the account of the Frenchman\r\nPlauchut in the Revue des deux mondes for 1877; but Plauchut, as well\r\nas Montero y Vidal himself, was resident in or near Manila at the\r\ntime of these occurrences. Finally, Dr. Pardo de Tavera, a nephew of\r\none of the prominent Philippine Spaniards who were deported, supports\r\nPlauchut's version and impeaches Montero y Vidal's. [122]\r\n\r\nReforms and Demands for more. \"Assimilation.\"--The reactionists had\r\nregained the saddle in the Philippines even before the Republic in\r\nSpain came to an end; they used the incident of the Cavite mutiny as\r\na \"horrible example,\" and succeeded in repealing or nullifying all\r\nreforms not to their taste even in educational or purely administrative\r\nmatters. Till after 1880, the \"Filipino cause\" was in hiding. But\r\nmeanwhile young Filipinos of wealth were going abroad for education,\r\nand above all a new generation of Filipinos were coming from the new\r\nmiddle class produced by the better industrial opportunities consequent\r\nupon expanding trade and commerce, were breathing in popular ideas\r\nof hostility to the friars in the more advanced rural districts, and\r\nwere exchanging ideas, and imbibing in the exchange a new sentiment\r\nof nationality, when they met, in constantly increasing numbers,\r\nin the colleges and normal school at Manila, Tagálogs, Ilokanos,\r\nBisayans and others of the hitherto separate communities. Regional\r\nfeeling was still strong, but it was beginning to break down. [123]\r\nThose who went abroad for education soon began to propagate the idea,\r\nalready half expressed at home, that Philippine education, even with\r\nthe improvements, was still archaic and in some ways anti-modern;\r\nand every avenue out of this condition was found to be blocked by the\r\nfriars. If in reality the men of Spanish blood (in whole or part)\r\nwho had agitated for greater political liberties during 1868-72,\r\nhad aimed at separating the Philippines from Spain--and all the\r\nreasonable probabilities are opposed to such a belief--at any\r\nrate, the new generation of Filipinos who took up the cause in the\r\neighties were ardent and, for some time at least, sincere advocates\r\nof Spanish-Philippine union. They carried the matter, indeed, to the\r\nextreme, in the campaign for \"assimilation,\" which has already been\r\ncharacterized as unpractical.\r\n\r\nReforms of a partial nature, any statesman could predict, would breed\r\nthe demand for more. So, during the eighties, when most headway was\r\nmade in administrative and legal reforms under Liberal administrations,\r\nwe find the Filipinos formulating demands for the first time; and\r\nit is significant that they all centered about the friars. Under the\r\nliberal Governor-General Terrero, and with sympathetic Spaniards in\r\nthe posts of secretary of the civil administration and civil governor\r\nof Manila, officers of some of the Tagálog towns ventured to display a\r\nsense of independence of the traditional friar-dictatorship in local\r\naffairs, even (in the case of Malolos and the Binondo district of\r\nManila) to carry contests with the friars over the personal tax-lists\r\nbefore higher authority; the friars' tenants around Kalamba, where\r\nJosé Rizal's parents lived, challenged the administrator of that\r\nDominican estate, and aired their protests publicly in 1887; [124]\r\nand in 1888 a public demonstration against the friars, and especially\r\nArchbishop Payo, took place in Manila, and a petition for the removal\r\nof the friars was addressed to the Queen Regent. In 1887 these\r\ncivil authorities of Liberal affiliation had issued official orders\r\nregarding cemeteries and church funerals, contravening, on grounds\r\nof public health, long-standing practices of the friar-curates; and\r\nthe friars, even the archbishop, had been almost openly intransigent\r\nabout the matter, indicating the belief that they would soon upset\r\nthis régime of affairs by the exercise of their power at Madrid. The\r\ndemand on the part of some Spanish periodicals of Manila that the\r\nproposed government trade school should not be surrendered to the\r\nAugustinians was another indication of the current of the times. [125]\r\n\r\nIn form at least, there was nothing in any of these demonstrations\r\nor representations which would not be perfectly legitimate under\r\nany free government. Yet, even before the expiration of Terrero's\r\nterm, he was prevailed upon to send home Centeno y García, the civil\r\ngovernor of Manila, and the processes of law had been set in action by\r\njudicial authority against some of the participants. And, even before\r\nthe downfall of the Liberal ministry at Madrid, the mere display of\r\na disposition on the part of Filipinos to speak for themselves as\r\na people had started the currents of reaction there. Weyler was the\r\nsuccessor of Terrero as Governor-General. The friars' representations\r\nat Madrid obtained, while the Liberal minister Becerra [126] was\r\nstill in office, the omission of the provisions for civil marriage and\r\nregistration from the Civil Code as it was extended to the Philippines\r\nin 1889. Weyler used force to quell the subsequent disturbances at\r\nKalamba, and among the score or so of deportees were some of Rizal's\r\nfamily. [127]\r\n\r\nThe Propagandists.--A full history of the Filipino Propaganda would\r\nlist a large number of names, both of members of the Filipino colonies\r\nabroad and of secret agitators and wealthy contributors at home. But\r\nthe story must be developed from the various sources to be cited, and\r\nwe are concerned here with those who figured most actively by their\r\nwritings. Of these, Marcelo H. del Pilar and José Rizal were altogether\r\nthe most notable, their prominence indeed leading to the formation\r\nof factions about them and the display of those personal jealousies\r\nwhich wreck or threaten to wreck every Filipino movement. [128] It is\r\nsignificant that the propagandists coming to the front in the eighties\r\nwere, one may say, genuine \"sons of the people\" though associated with\r\nthem were others who were sons of the half-caste aristocracy. It is\r\nsignificant also, that, though these two leaders Del Pilar and Rizal,\r\ncame from Bulakan and Laguna provinces respectively, the heart of the\r\nmore advanced communities of Tagálogs around Manila, yet the islands as\r\na whole were beginning to be represented in the propaganda, notably by\r\nthe Lunas, from Ilokos, and Graciano Lopez Jaena, a Bisayan. The latter\r\nstarted the first Filipino periodical of consequence, La Solidaridad,\r\nand published eighteen numbers of it at Barcelona up to October 31,\r\n1889, when Del Pilar took charge of it, transferred it to Madrid and\r\nedited it there as a fortnightly till 1895. It was face to face with\r\nLa Política de España en Filipinas from 1891, and, as the latter\r\nis the chief source for the pro-friar and anti-liberal side of the\r\ncontroversy, so La Solidaridad, which circulated among the educated\r\nFilipinos in many parts of the archipelago despite the censorship,\r\nis the chief source for the writings of the propagandists. [129]\r\n\r\nMarcelo H. del Pilar had taken an active part in stimulating\r\nopposition to the friar-curates, particularly in matters of local\r\ngovernment, in his native province (Bulakan) for some years before\r\nthe troubles of 1888. When the pendulum swung towards reaction, he\r\nleft his family (being then a man of middle-age) and went to Spain\r\nto carry on the fight close by the center of government, support of\r\nhis campaign being pledged by a committee who undertook to secure\r\nFilipino subscriptions, certain wealthy Filipinos being identified\r\nprivately with the cause. Del Pilar's writings show nothing of the\r\npoet or dreamer, as do Rizal's; he had, in some degree, an \"economic\r\nmind,\" though entirely untrained in that line, and he was at the\r\noutset of the active propaganda in Spain (1889) a maturer man than\r\nRizal. Coming straight from the problems of actual life among his\r\npeople, he stated their grievances with more practical reference to\r\ndirect and immediate remedies and with special reference to their\r\neconomic status; while Rizal, as a student in contact with modern\r\nEuropean life and thought, dreamed of and preached, in more general\r\nterms but on a far wider scope, the social regeneration of his people\r\nand the expansion of their political rights. Del Pilar would have\r\nmade a good representative of his people in the Cortes. But Rizal\r\nwas a genius, who with the touch of imagination and satire lifted the\r\ncause of the Filipinos to a place in the thought of the world, and at\r\nthe same time, as poet and patriot combined, fired the enthusiasm of\r\nhis own people and became their idol. And, in the course of events,\r\nit was Rizal who proved the soberer, the more mature as time went\r\nby. He was opposed to means of violence, even to the last, and the\r\nwhole record bears out his protestations on this score; he still\r\nlooked to the future as a dreamer-patriot, but he also looked to\r\nthe present state of his people and saw that the most vital problem\r\nwas the teaching them that they must raise themselves by their own\r\nefforts, must deserve a better destiny. Del Pilar, disappointed\r\nby the failure to achieve greater immediate, practical results by\r\nrelying upon the progress of Liberalism in Spain, after seven years\r\nof propaganda along these lines, was starting for Hongkong or Japan,\r\nto conduct there a really revolutionary campaign, when death overtook\r\nhim shortly before the Tagálog revolt in 1896. He had, apparently,\r\nlost faith in the ideals of \"assimilation,\" of Spanish-Filipino unity,\r\nwhich he had set forth in glowing phrases in 1888 and 1889. He had\r\nalso, apparently, become convinced that the upper-class Filipinos,\r\nespecially the most wealthy and prominent, were too lukewarm or too\r\nprone to temporize for safety's sake, that the time had come to make\r\nthe cause more distinctly one of the people as a whole. He is credited\r\nwith having suggested and outlined the organization of the Katipunan,\r\nand he seems to have concluded that it was time for the Filipinos to\r\nresort to Cuba's example and not to political petitions only. [130]\r\n\r\nEven in Noli me tangere, first published under his own eye at Berlin\r\nin 1887, when Rizal, at the age of twenty-six, was just fairly setting\r\nout in life, there are many evidences that the author, if he meant\r\nprimarily to set before the world the backwardness of the existing\r\nsocial and political régime in the Philippines, its stifling of\r\nthought, and its many tyrannies, had also in mind to set before his\r\npeople, in some of his instantaneous photographs of Philippine life,\r\ntheir own defects. In El filibusterismo (Ghent, 1891), the more\r\nmature reformer preached yet more plainly the necessity of social\r\nand political progress beginning from below, and not simply inspired\r\nfrom above. That his people took the lessons meant for themselves\r\n(and take them still today) less to heart than they responded to the\r\nsatire and invective directed against the form of rule imposed upon\r\nthem, was the fault not of Rizal but of human nature, prone to apply\r\nthe preacher's words only to the other fellow.\r\n\r\nIt is a great misfortune that we have in English no real translation\r\nof Noli me tangere, [131] and none at all of El filibusterismo,\r\nwhich, as a political document, is the stronger of the two. [132]\r\nIt is no less regrettable that no biography of Rizal, tracing his\r\nmental development and his relation with the events of 1880 to 1896,\r\nnor even a good biographical sketch of him, has been published in the\r\nEnglish language. Retana's biographical and bibliographical notes,\r\npublished in a Madrid monthly, Nuestro Tiempo, 1904-06, and about to\r\nappear in book form, are indispensable as the only comprehensive work\r\non the subject, and resort must be had to them for a full array of\r\ncitations, as also for many documents not available elsewhere. [133]\r\nRizal's edition (Paris, 1890) of Morga's Sucesos de las islas Filipinas\r\nhas already been cited in connection with that work in VOLS. XV and\r\nXVI of this series (see note 3 of former). Its annotations are Rizal's\r\nchief contribution to the history of his people, and it must be said\r\nthat his political feeling has crept into them to the damage often\r\nof their scientific value. [134] There also deserve mention here\r\nRizal's discussion in 1889 of the future of his people, [135] and\r\nsome of Blumentritt's writings about Rizal and in his defense. [136]\r\n\r\nMasonry, Liga Filipina, etc.--In almost all the Spanish writings\r\nabout the Philippine insurrection, especially those by friars, we find\r\nit ascribed primarily to \"Franc-Masonería,\" the terrible bugaboo in\r\nnaming which the Spanish friar sums up in one word his notion of all\r\nthat is pernicious in modern life since the French Revolution, and\r\nthe chief cause of the loss by Spain of her American colonies. So,\r\nas to the Philippines, the argument is, had not Spanish Masons been\r\nable secretly to organize there, and to pervert the minds of certain\r\nFilipinos, the colony would have remained in its loyalty of primitive\r\nsimplicity and happiness. The truth is that Masonry played a very\r\nsecondary part in the Filipino agitation for reform, furnishing simply\r\na convenient medium for conducting the propaganda. Up to the last\r\nten years of Spanish rule, only a few lodges of Spanish Liberals and\r\nforeigners, into which some of the half-castes and more well-to-do\r\nFilipinos had been admitted, had been organized in the Philippines,\r\nand had led a rather irregular existence. At about the time when La\r\nSolidaridad was moved to Madrid, a Spanish-Filipino Association was\r\nthere formed, in which Spaniards and Filipinos combined to agitate\r\nfor reform. This circle was virtually identified in membership with\r\na certain Spanish Grand Lodge (probably spurious, as regards the\r\nlegitimate parent organization of Free Masonry), which delegated\r\nagents to conduct the active organization of new Philippine lodges\r\ndependent upon it. It appears certain that this was done with the idea\r\ndefinitely in view of being able thus to propagate liberal political\r\nideas and secretly distribute such literature among the Filipinos,\r\nalso the more easily to raise funds for the work. But had not such\r\na favorable means of conducting the propaganda been presented, it\r\nwould have been improvised. One must subject to critical examination\r\nthe Spanish writings, and will readily discover their exaggerated\r\ndeductions from such facts as came to light. [137] Interesting reading\r\nis afforded by the confidential Royal Order of July 2, 1896, addressed\r\nto Governor-General Blanco. [138] It approves his deportation of the\r\nprincipales, or headmen, of Malolos and Taal (who had defied the\r\nlocal friar-curates), and orders him to have provincial and other\r\nofficials watch and report confidentially on all secret organizations\r\n(forbidden by the Laws of the Indies, as recited in Royal Order of\r\nAugust 2, 1888) and list all persons of whom \"there may be indications\r\nenough to believe that they are affiliated,\" etc. (opening up thus\r\na splendid opportunity for private denunciations). He is to use in\r\nthis secret work only officials who are Peninsulars, never natives;\r\nso also he is to invite coöperation of \"the parish-priests who belong\r\nto the religious orders.\" As to punishments, it is preferable to deport\r\nthe \"suspected,\" fixing their residence in the Moro country or Guam,\r\nrather than to exile them, as they would then join the colonies abroad\r\nand conduct a propaganda.\r\n\r\nThe project of Marcelo del Pilar for an association called Solidaridad\r\nFilipina, [139] which came to nothing practical, and the Liga Filipina,\r\norganized by Rizal just before his deportation from Manila in July,\r\n1892, though in part modeled after Masonry, are among the things\r\nwhich show that the Filipino propagandists did not confine their\r\nefforts to Masonic organization. Our Spanish sources would have it\r\nthat the Liga Filipina was really separatist in character, and the\r\nprosecution deliberately based upon this charge the demand for Rizal's\r\nconviction in 1896. It remains unproved, and the statutes of the League\r\nas prepared by Rizal [140] entirely support his assertion that the\r\ndesign of the League was to foster coöperation among the Filipinos,\r\nto \"raise the arts and sciences,\" and develop Filipino commercial and\r\neconomic interests generally. The organization was a fraternal society,\r\nin effect, the aim being to bring Filipinos closer together in a\r\n\"brotherhood,\" and incidentally to undermine the control of Chinese\r\nand others upon the trade of the country--in which respects it would\r\nlikely have proved mostly utopian, even had not political conditions\r\nand Rizal's deportation brought it virtually to naught. In the pledges\r\nof its \"brothers\" to stand by each other for the \"remedy of abuses\"\r\nas well as for other things, the League very plainly looked toward\r\nunity of action in matters social and political, and no doubt the\r\nidea of bringing his people together for such political action as\r\nmight become possible was foremost in the mind of Rizal and its other\r\norganizers. But this does not prove the charge that it merely covered\r\nup a plan to get arms and rise in rebellion as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Katipunan.--We come now to the parting of the ways. Just as Marcelo\r\ndel Pilar had concluded that the time was at hand for more vigorous\r\nmeasures, so on the other hand some of the Filipinos of education\r\nand social position (cautious also, in some cases, because of their\r\nproperty) had become discouraged and faint-hearted. The deportation\r\nof Rizal had its effect in 1892, and the local government reforms of\r\n1893-94 were followed by a reactionary government in Spain which might\r\nnullify even such concessions, in the face of the constant demand for a\r\ncheck upon the half-liberal régime of Blanco. Some of the middle-class\r\nleaders of Manila, who had been drawn into the Masonic movement, had\r\ndecided that the time had come to organize the masses, at least in the\r\nTagálog provinces. Andrés Bonifacio, an employe of a foreign business\r\nhouse in Manila, was the leading spirit; gathering his ideas of modern\r\nreform from reading Spanish treatises on the French Revolution, he had\r\nimbibed also a notion that the methods of the mob in Paris were those\r\nbest adapted to secure amelioration for the Filipinos. His ideas were\r\nthose of a socialist, and of a socialist of the French Revolution type,\r\nand he thought them applicable to an undeveloped tropical country,\r\nwhere the pressure of industrial competition is almost unknown,\r\nand where with the slightest reasonable exertion starvation may be\r\ndismissed from thought. There was in this new propaganda an element\r\nof resentment toward the wealthy, upper-class Filipinos, the landed\r\nproprietors in general, as well as toward the friar landlords and\r\nthe whole fabric of government and society resting on them. Summing\r\nup all the evidence he has been able to obtain on the Katipunan, the\r\nwriter agrees with Felipe G. Calderón, a Filipino, in his opinion\r\n[141] that its socialistic character negatives the assertion of\r\nthe Spanish writers that the upper-class Filipinos were its real\r\nsupporters and directors, working in the background; and that, while\r\nthis propaganda from below looked to independence and the substitution\r\nof Spanish rule by Filipino rule, yet it was without any political\r\nprogram, properly speaking, and there was merely a crude idea in\r\nthe minds of the masses that they were somehow going to shake off\r\ntheir masters, get rid of the whites, and divide up the big estates\r\nnot only of the friars but of Filipino landholders as well. Calderón\r\ndoes not discuss the alleged plan of the Katipunan to assassinate the\r\nwhites, especially the friars. It is certain that such bloodthirsty\r\nideas were in the minds of some of the leaders; but the more direct\r\ndocumentary evidence that has been produced on this point is perhaps\r\nopen to the suspicion that it was manufactured in connection with\r\nthe courts-martial which operated with such fury after the outbreak\r\nof revolt in 1896. [142] After all the furore that had been made, the\r\nactual revelations as to the importance of the organization, character\r\nof its leaders, number of its followers, and extent of its operations,\r\nwould have made the whole affair somewhat ridiculous, had it not been\r\nrepresented that behind this humble organization of perhaps forty\r\nthousand initiates in the Tagálog towns there was a great program for\r\nsetting up an independent government and that the upper-class Filipinos\r\nwere simply using this organization as a stalking-horse. The truth\r\nappears to be that, while these over-important Katipunan leaders\r\nthought in terms grandiloquent, and led their humble followers in\r\nthe towns around Manila most affected by the propaganda to indulge\r\nin futile and ridiculous dreams of a coming millennium (while some of\r\nthemselves were quarreling over the obols contributed), the movement\r\nwas mostly talk even up to the time when an Augustinian curate in\r\nManila made himself the hero of the rabid Spanish element in Manila by\r\n\"exposing\" an organization about which the governmental authorities\r\nhad had partial information for some weeks, or even months. Bonifacio\r\nstarted this separate organization in 1894, but Calderón seems to be\r\ncorrect in saying that work in the towns outside of Manila was only\r\nbegun in the spring of 1896. The humble followers were assured that\r\nthe Japanese government would help them oust Spain, and that rifles\r\nto arm the whole population would come from there. But Japan never\r\nin the least violated her obligations to Spain, and, if the leaders\r\neven bought any rifles in Japan, they must have been few indeed. [143]\r\nWhen Bonifacio sent an emissary to Dapitan in the spring of 1896, to\r\npropose to Rizal a plan of armed revolt and that he should escape on\r\na steam vessel sent for the purpose, and join in this campaign, Rizal\r\nrejected the proposition as folly, and displayed his great impatience\r\nwith it. [144] On every ground, it seems probable that, had not Friar\r\nGil and the Spanish press of Manila been so insistent on giving great\r\npublicity to some Katipunan engraving-stones, receipts for dues, etc.,\r\nkept in hiding by the affiliated employes of a Spanish newspaper,\r\nthe revolt might never have come about at all. Certainly, no date was\r\nset for it (though various future dates had been vaguely discussed),\r\ntill the sudden arrests of August 19 and 20, 1896, sent Bonifacio and\r\nhis companions fleeing to Bulakan Province where, practically without\r\narms, they appealed to their fellow-workers in Bulakan, Manila, and\r\nCavite provinces to rise in revolt on August 30. The friars and the\r\nrabid element of Spanish patriots were so anxious to force the hand\r\nof Blanco, and to discredit him, that, it may be, they forced upon a\r\nmilitary commander whose troops were mostly in Mindanao a revolt that,\r\na few months further on, might either have dissipated itself or have\r\nbeen avoided by an adequate show of force. [145]\r\n\r\nBecause the friars are so much to the fore in all the discussions of\r\nthese events, we must not overlook the part played by governmental\r\nabuses, as already described. The Civil Guard, given a more extensive\r\norganization and scope of action during these closing years of Spanish\r\nrule, by its abuses (committed, for the most part, by Filipinos\r\nupon their own fellows) played probably the foremost part in drawing\r\nodium upon the government. [146] Next to police abuses, and sometimes\r\nallied with them, were the misuses of the powers of local government\r\n(with which alone the great majority of the people came into direct\r\ncontact), especially in regard to the levy of forced labor; and here\r\nagain, the humble Filipino's complaint was chiefly against his own\r\nfellow-countrymen of power and position. But, summing up all the\r\nadministrative abuses and all the evils of the government system, we\r\nare still left a long way from agreement with the friars' assertions\r\nthat the masses loved them and that governmental abuses were the sole\r\ncause of rebellion. [147]\r\n\r\nInsurrection of 1896-97.--No history from the Filipino side has\r\nyet come to light, and there are certain points that can be cleared\r\nup only by the frank testimony of the Filipino participants. [148]\r\nWe are dependent chiefly on Spanish sources, written in the passion\r\nof the times by men not careful about sifting the facts. All things\r\nconsidered, the two best sources, both for what they say and for\r\nwhat may be inferred from them, are the so-called Memorias of two\r\nGovernor-Generals, prepared in order to defend their administrations\r\nbefore the Spanish Senate and the public; that of Blanco covering the\r\npreparatory stage and early months of the rebellion, that of Primo\r\nde Rivera its closing stages. Between these two Governor-Generals,\r\nthe work of Monteverde y Sedano covers the military operations under\r\nPolavieja.\r\n\r\nBlanco's Memoria [149] affords, unconsciously, the most severe\r\nindictment that could be passed on Spain's fitness to hold the\r\nPhilippines (or her other colonies) in 1898. This man was really of\r\nliberal temperament; he had formed a just conception of the real\r\ninsignificance of the Katipunan movement; and he strove, when the\r\ncrisis was prematurely forced on him, to restrain the vindictiveness\r\nof the rabid Spanish element, and really believed in the efficacy of a\r\n\"policy of attraction.\" But instead of setting forth on broader grounds\r\nthe reasons for his course of action and discussing with sincerity\r\nand frankness a policy for the Philippines, he felt compelled after\r\nhis return to Spain to bow before the howls of press and public. He\r\ndefends himself before his clerical-conservative critics not by showing\r\nthe folly of their illiberal policy for the colony, but endeavors\r\nto prove that they were wrong in accusing him of lack of severity as\r\nwell as of energy. Thus we learn (p. 20) that, even under a Blanco,\r\nbefore the outbreak came, one thousand and forty-two persons had been\r\ndeported \"as Masons, disaffected and suspicious or harmful to their\r\ntowns.\" During the night of August 19-20, 1896, following the sensation\r\ncreated by Friar Gil, there were forty-three arrests in Manila, and\r\nthree hundred more within the next week. During September, thirty\r\nseven men taken in arms were shot, after summary trials (p. 25.) The\r\nnumber of Filipinos, mostly men of some position, who had not taken\r\nup arms, but were arrested for alleged complicity in the Katipunan,\r\nand involved in the trials before a special court for conspiracy and\r\nsedition, very soon mounted to five hundred, including those sent\r\nin from the provinces. Some remained incomunicados for more than\r\nforty days. The men executed from September 4 to December 12, 1896,\r\nwhen Blanco surrendered command to Polavieja, numbered seventy-four\r\nin all. [150]\r\n\r\nEvidence as to the \"reign of terror\" that was inaugurated in Manila may\r\nbe drawn from the Spanish treatises to be cited, wherein the episode\r\nis recited with gusto. The Spanish press of Manila for 1896-98;\r\nalso that of Spain, especially Philippine letters of 1896-98 in La\r\nPolítica de España en Filipinas, El Heraldo, El Imparcial and El\r\nCorreo of Madrid, furnished the original source of information for\r\nthese writers, and should be used to supplement this history of the\r\ninsurrection. Transcriptions of testimony taken by the special court\r\nfor sedition and conspiracy appear in Retana's Archivo, iii and iv, and\r\nevidences that the more yielding witnesses had their phraseology, and\r\nsometimes their statements of fact, dictated to them will be noted by\r\nthe careful reader, especially if he be familiar with Spanish methods\r\nof judicial procedure. References to the common use of torture to\r\nmake witnesses (in some cases eager enough to insure their own safety\r\nby \"delation\") sign such testimony, will be found in the Filipino\r\npress since 1898, occasionally also in Spanish periodicals of Manila\r\nsince 1898. [151] These same sources also supplement the citations\r\non Rizal already given, for the story of his trial and execution,\r\nand the increase of severity and terrorism after Polavieja took\r\ncharge. They are also, in the main, our sole, fragmentary sources\r\non the state of Cavite during insurgent control of the province,\r\nthe insurgent organization, etc. [152]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish treatises and pamphlets on the insurrection are: [153]\r\nJosé M. del Castillo y Jimenez, El Katipunan, ó el Filibusterismo\r\nen Filipinas (Madrid, 1897).

Of little value.\r\n\r\nThe Pact of Biak-na-bató.--Purposely, the word \"treaty,\" so often\r\napplied to this transaction, is here avoided; for, apart from\r\ntechnical objections to a word that applies to agreements between\r\nsovereign powers, this was no treaty in any sense of the word. There\r\nwas some mystery surrounding the negotiations by which the insurgent\r\nchiefs surrendered a few hundred nondescript firearms and retired to\r\nHongkong; untrue or half-true charges were bandied back and forth,\r\nfor political effect, in the Cortes and the press of Spain; and,\r\nof the chief actors in the affair, only Primo de Rivera has given\r\nhis account--perhaps not with entire frankness. [156] Aguinaldo has\r\nconfined his statements on the subject to the most brief assertions\r\nof a general nature [157] to the effect that reforms by the Spanish\r\ngovernment were promised. Primo de Rivera categorically denies this;\r\nwhile Pedro A. Paterno, the go-between, has made no statement at\r\nall during the nine years that have passed since the conflicting\r\nstatements have been before the public, involving directly the\r\nquestion of his own veracity and good faith. Primo de Rivera is an\r\nex parte witness, to be sure; but his statements upon the more vital\r\npoints involved are corroborated by the very insurgent documents on\r\nthis subject captured by the American army in 1899 and now in the\r\nWar Department at Washington. [158] Primo de Rivera says that, when\r\nPaterno presented a paper early in the negotiations containing a full\r\nprogram of reforms, [159] he rejected the document absolutely, saying\r\nhe could not discuss such matters with the insurgent chiefs, that\r\nthe Spanish government would accord such reforms as it thought wise,\r\nand he could only interpose his good offices to make recommendations\r\nin that respect. The copy of this document now in the War Department\r\nat Washington shows the clauses about reform to have been crossed\r\nout. Primo de Rivera says that, from that time forth, the negotiation\r\nwas purely on the basis of a payment to the rebel chiefs to surrender\r\ntheir arms, order the insurgents in the other provinces to do the same,\r\nand emigrate to foreign parts. The only documents bearing signatures on\r\nboth sides, either of those published at Washington or elsewhere, refer\r\nexclusively to these particular points of money, surrender of arms,\r\nand program of emigration, though Paterno inserted in a preliminary\r\nof the final contract on these subjects a clause as to reposing\r\nconfidence in the Spanish government to \"satisfy the desire of the\r\nFilipino people.\" [160] Primo de Rivera recommended the transaction to\r\nhis government for one reason, expressly because it would \"discredit\r\n[desprestigiando] the chiefs selling out and emigrating.\" [161]\r\n\r\nThe first proposition of the insurgents was for 3,000,000 pesos; Primo\r\nde Rivera acceded, under authority from Madrid, to 1,700,000 pesos;\r\nand the total sum named in the contract signed on December 14, 1897, is\r\n800,000 pesos. When Aguinaldo and his twenty-seven companions reached\r\nHongkong, they received 400,000 pesos and never any more. Though\r\nreally looking at it as a bribe, the Spanish government had consented\r\nto the money payment ostensibly on the ground of indemnity to widows,\r\norphans, and those who had suffered property losses by the war, and\r\nto provide support for the insurgent chiefs abroad. That it was the\r\nidea of at least some of the insurgent leaders that the money was\r\nto be divided between them is shown by a protest signed by eight\r\nof those who remained behind to secure the surrender of more arms\r\nthan the paltry number of two hundred and twenty-five turned over at\r\nBiak-na-bató, appealing to Primo de Rivera for \"their share.\" [162]\r\nThe latter says he turned over to these men and Paterno the 200,000\r\npesos of the second payment (the actual disposition of which is\r\nunknown [163]); and that he turned over the remaining 200,000 pesos\r\nto Governor-General Augustín in April, 1898, when it was evident that\r\npeace had not been assured, after all. As to the remaining 900,000\r\npesos which Primo de Rivera had authority to pay, but which did not\r\nappear in the final contract, Primo de Rivera says (pp. 133, 134)\r\nthat Paterno omitted them from the document because they were to be\r\nused to \"indemnify those not in arms,\" and that he did not \"think it\r\nprudent to inquire further about them at the time.\" [164]\r\n\r\nEnough has been developed to show the demoralizing character of the\r\ntransaction. In justice to Aguinaldo and his closest associates,\r\nit is to be said that they had kept the money practically intact,\r\nfor use in a possible future insurrection, until they spent some of\r\nit for arms after Commodore Dewey's victory in Manila Bay. [165]\r\nNor are we able to say categorically that Aguinaldo and the other\r\nleaders in Biak-na-bató were not led to believe that specific reforms\r\nhad been promised verbally by Primo de Rivera in the name of his\r\ngovernment; Aguinaldo and Paterno could clear up that matter, but\r\nneither speaks. Just what informal discussion of this subject there\r\nwas between Paterno and Primo de Rivera, we do not know; but the\r\nlatter's own version will warrant the conclusion that he at least\r\npermitted Paterno to lay before the insurgents the fact that he was\r\nmaking recommendations on this line, and to hold out the expectation\r\nof results, once he was not confronted with armed rebellion. [166] He\r\ndeclares that a scheme of Philippine reform, covering also the friar\r\nquestion, had been drawn up and agreed upon, when Premier Cánovas\r\nwas assassinated and the Conservatives soon after fell from power;\r\nbut he does not tell us what were the reforms as to the friars. Primo\r\nde Rivera continued to give his ideas as to the need for reform in\r\nprovision of parishes, church fees, local government, education, civil\r\nservice, etc., after the Liberals came into power. Yet, though stating\r\nthe case against the friars in strong terms, virtually confirming every\r\ncharge made against them, he appears to have advised only a curtailment\r\nof their power and a more rigid discipline, not their elimination as\r\nparish-priests, which was the aim of most of the insurgents. [167]\r\nWhen a Spanish editor in Manila began writing in February, 1898, of\r\npolitical reforms in the direction of \"autonomy,\" without submitting\r\nhis articles to previous censure, Primo de Rivera suspended publication\r\nof the periodical. [168] That Spanish circles in Manila as well as\r\nthe Filipinos were in expectation, in late 1897 and early 1898, of\r\nthe announcement of some comprehensive scheme of Philippine reform, is\r\napparent from the press of the time. [169] The Liberal press of Madrid\r\nand Barcelona was also actively agitating reform for the Philippines,\r\nand Spanish Liberals and Filipinos addressed petitions on the subject\r\nto the government at Madrid. [170] The general belief at Manila was\r\nalso that some sort of promise of reforms had passed at Biak-na-bató,\r\neven that it included the gradual withdrawal of the friars. [171] That\r\nthe religious orders themselves knew that they were the storm-center\r\nis sufficiently shown by the Memorial of April 21, 1898, reproduced\r\npost, pp. 227-286. [172]\r\n\r\nThe Question of Independence.--We have, on one hand, the assertions\r\nof rabid Spanish writers that separation from Spain was throughout\r\nthe real aim of the Filipino leaders, who merely covered it under\r\na plea for reforms (the friars say, under a false assertion that\r\nthe Filipinos were opposed to them). We have, in direct opposition,\r\nthe assertions of Spanish Liberals and of some Filipinos that the\r\nmovement was inspired by genuine loyalty to Spain, and was only a\r\nprotest and appeal for reforms even in its last phase as an outbreak\r\nin arms, 1896-98. This view was accepted by the Schurman Commission\r\nin 1899. Again, during the years from 1898 to date, when demands\r\nfor independence were made upon the United States, the more radical\r\nFilipino leaders, first in insurrection, now in political agitation,\r\nhave asserted that complete political independence was definitely the\r\naim in 1896-97, and was the ideal in mind for some years before. Thus\r\nthey would corroborate the assertions of the more rabid Spaniards who\r\nclaimed that Rizal and all his co-workers, both in the aristocratic\r\nranks above and in the Katipunan below, were hypocritical in their\r\nprotestations of loyalty to Spain. Where does the truth lie?\r\n\r\nThe fact is, one can sustain any view he prefers to take of\r\nthis subject, by detached citations from documents of one sort or\r\nanother. The real answer is to be found only by a careful survey of all\r\nthe evidence as to Filipino activities and aspirations. We note that,\r\nwhen Rizal discusses the possibility of future independence for his\r\npeople, he sets it as a century hence. We need not take him literally,\r\nnor, on the other hand, need we say his title was merely hypocritical,\r\nand he was insidiously inciting his people to think of immediate\r\nindependence; we shall be fairer to survey his writings as a whole,\r\nprobably reaching the conclusion that the independence of his people\r\nwas constantly in his mind, but sober reason warned him to restrain\r\nhis and their youthful impatience on the subject. In discussing\r\nDel Pilar and Rizal, it has already been pointed out how the former\r\nchanged places with the younger man and became the more impatient of\r\nthe two; and the connection of this growing impatience with the more\r\nviolent nature of the Katipunan has been shown. So it is not enough to\r\ncite detached passages from Rizal or Del Pilar, for example, to prove\r\neither that they were just filibusters under cover of protestations or,\r\non the contrary, that they never dreamed of independence. [173] The\r\npropagandists felt differently at different times, under the pressure\r\nsometimes of self-interest, influenced sometimes by momentary incidents\r\nor passions. It is plain that, with some of them at least, a new tone\r\nhad been adopted toward Spain when, at the beginning of 1896, the\r\nmanifesto of the Katipunan organ to the Filipinos bitterly exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"At the end of three hundred years of slavery ..., our people have\r\ndone nothing but lament and ask a little consideration and a little\r\nclemency; but they have answered our lamentations with exile and\r\nimprisonment. For seven years in succession La Solidaridad voluntarily\r\nlent itself and exhausted its powers to obtain, not all that they\r\nought to concede, but only just what of right is owing to us. And\r\nwhat has been the fruit of our effort unto fatigue and of our loyal\r\nfaith? Deception, ridicule, death, and bitterness.\r\n\r\n\"Today, tired of lifting our hands in continual lamentation, we are\r\nat last ourselves; little by little our voice has lost its tone of\r\nmelancholy gained in continual complaint; now ... we raise our heads,\r\nso long accustomed to being bowed, and imbibe strength from the firm\r\nhope we possess by reason of the grandeur of our aim.... We can tell\r\nthem bluntly that the phrase 'Spain the Mother' is nothing but just\r\na bit of adulation, that it is not to be compared with the piece of\r\ncloth or rag by which it is enchained, which trails on the ground;\r\nthat there is no such mother and no such child; that there is only\r\na race that robs, a people that fattens on what is not its own, and\r\na people that is weary of going, not merely ungorged, but unfed;\r\nthat we have to put reliance in nothing but our own powers and in\r\nour defense of our own selves.\"\r\n\r\nRizal put in the mouth of the old Filipino priest in El Filibusterismo\r\n(1891) the view of the thoughtful Filipino patriot, considering\r\nthe social defects of his people: \"We owe the ill that afflicts us\r\nto ourselves; let us not put the blame on anyone else. If Spain saw\r\nthat we were less complaisant in the face of tyranny, and readier to\r\nstrive and suffer for our rights, Spain would be the first to give\r\nus liberty.... But so long as the Filipino people has not sufficient\r\nvigor to proclaim, with erect front and bared breast, its right to\r\nthe social life and to make that right good by sacrifice, with its\r\nown blood; so long as we see that our countrymen, though hearing in\r\ntheir private life the voice of shame and the clamors of conscience,\r\nyet in public life hold their peace or join the chorus about him who\r\ncommits abuses and ridicules the victim of the abuse; so long as we see\r\nthem shut themselves up to their own egotism and praise with forced\r\nsmile the most iniquitous acts, while their eyes are begging a part\r\nof the booty of such acts, why should liberty be given to them? With\r\nSpain or without Spain, they would be always the same, and perhaps,\r\nperhaps, they would be worse. Of what use would be independence if\r\nthe slaves of today would be the tyrants of tomorrow? And they would\r\nbe so without doubt, for he loves tyranny who submits to it.\"\r\n\r\nDoubtless Rizal felt that his people had made progress toward social\r\nindependence in the five years that followed, till the Katipunan\r\noutbreak came; but he condemned that beforehand as a foolish venture,\r\nand reprobated it as harmful to Filipino interests before his\r\ndeath. Though in a sense this was a movement for independence, we\r\nhave seen that only vague ideas of a political organization were in\r\nthe minds of the leaders, while the deluded masses who followed them\r\nwith, for the most part, bolos only, had virtually no idea of such an\r\norganization, except that Filipinos should succeed Spaniards. [174]\r\nThe prematurely commenced revolt, as it gained at the outset, some\r\ndefensive advantages over the bad military organization of Spain,\r\ndeveloped ideas and aspirations quite beyond the early crude dreams\r\nof its leaders; they were really surprised at their own (temporary)\r\nsuccess, and emboldened thereby. [175] Even after the loss of Cavite,\r\nwhen the revolutionists were hemmed in and hiding in the Bulakan\r\nMountains, they put forward, in an \"Assembly\" at Biak-na-bató, a more\r\ncomprehensive and ambitious political program (a Filipino Republic,\r\nin short) than had ever before been drawn up by Filipinos. [176]\r\nWe know also that no small part was played by the \"reign of terror\"\r\nin turning even the moderate Filipinos against Spanish rule as an\r\nentirety. We should be far from the truth if we should say that\r\nthis Tagálog rebellion, and the demonstrations of sympathy with\r\nit in other provinces, brought the Filipino people together in a\r\nunanimous sentiment for independence. That it did greatly stimulate\r\nthis feeling is certain. He would be a bold man who would now assert\r\nthat independence was not the common aspiration, when outside pressure\r\nsuddenly pricked the bubble of Spanish authority in 1898 and released\r\nthe people for the free expression of their sentiments. But he is\r\nequally bold who asserts that the Filipino people had been suddenly\r\nand miraculously transformed into a real nation by these events, or\r\nthat the Aguinaldo government had the support of or really represented\r\nthe whole country, above all of the most sober-thinking Filipinos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENTS IN FILIPINAS, 1841-1872\r\n\r\n\r\nThis period, opening with the coming of Governor Marcelino de Oraá\r\nLecumberri, and closing during the governorship of Rafael de Izquierdo\r\ny Gutierrez, is one of the most important and critical in the history\r\nof the Philippines. It witnessed the insurrection of Tayabas (1841)\r\nunder the leadership of Apolinario de la Cruz (q.v., ante, pp. 92,\r\n93); the use of steamships against the Moros (1848), whereby the\r\nSpaniards gained great advantage; approval for the Spanish-Filipino\r\nbank, August 1, 1851, with a capital stock of 400,000 pesos, and\r\n2,000 shares of 200 pesos each, of which 1,000 shares were to be\r\nacquired by the obras pías and 1,000 were open to the public (the\r\nbank beginning operation in 1852); the reinstatement of the Jesuits\r\n(October 19, 1852; although the first band did not arrive until the\r\nmiddle of 1859), whereby education was given a slightly freer movement;\r\n[177] the famous educational laws of December 20, 1863, and other\r\neducational orders, decrees, and regulations (q.v., VOL. XLVI); the\r\nSpanish revolution of 1867-68, and the new constitution; the opening\r\nof the Suez Canal (November 17, 1869), by which communication with the\r\nmother-country was rendered quicker and easier, and liberalism given\r\nmore decided tendencies; and lastly, the Cavite insurrection of 1872,\r\nwhich ended with the execution of three native secular priests. During\r\nthis period there were in all fourteen regularly-appointed governors,\r\nand eleven provisional terms, in the latter, Ramon Montero y Blandino\r\nserving three times, and Joaquin del Solar twice--the average of each\r\nterm (regular and provisional) being slightly over one year. This was\r\ncomparatively a period of newspaper activity, about thirty newspapers\r\nbeing founded during these years. The entire period may be called\r\nthe period of adolescence.\r\n\r\nConditions in Spain were to a certain extent reflected in the\r\nislands. Confusion and uncertainty in the Peninsula had their\r\ncounterpart in the colony. The administrational experiments of the\r\nMadrid officials extended to the government of the colonies, and\r\nthere were many changes which vitally affected the Philippines. Some\r\nof the new laws were good; others show a greater or less ignorance\r\nregarding the islands. Throughout, however, the prevailing tone is\r\none of greater liberalism.\r\n\r\nTo be classed under foreign politics of the period were the laws\r\nregulating foreign commerce; the slight contact with the Dutch who\r\nappeared to be making overtures for a settlement in the Southern\r\nIslands; some negotiations with the celebrated Rajah Brooke; and the\r\ncampaign of Cochinchina, in which the Spaniards aided the French.\r\n\r\nLocal politics show great activity. Provincial limits were changed and\r\nfixed, and new provinces were created. Special subordinate governments\r\nwere created for the Visayan Islands and for the Marianas. Police\r\nregulations were made, and bodies of police created. There were\r\ncity improvements in Manila. Reforms were instituted in the various\r\nprovinces in regard to the alcaldes-mayor. Various departments of\r\nthe government were also reorganized. In 1867-68 new regulations were\r\nadopted for the management of the Audiencia of Manila.\r\n\r\nIn nothing is the upward trend more strongly marked than in economic\r\nlines. The measures passed were often groping, it is true, but yet\r\non the whole looked toward the greater light. There was an attempt\r\nto exploit the coal mines of the islands, and mining regulations\r\nwere made. Agriculture received attention (see post, appendix on\r\nagriculture). Commerce was given greater concessions, and the customs\r\nduties were revised. Provincial chiefs were forbidden to engage in\r\ntrade. Various acts of legislation regarding monetary conditions,\r\nthe establishment of a mint, and the coinage of special money for\r\nthe Philippines attest the greater commercial activity. There was\r\nconsiderable legislation in regard to tobacco. The many laws regarding\r\nthe Chinese have a purely economic basis. Topographical maps which\r\nwere ordered made and the new roads ordered constructed indicate a\r\ndesire to know the country and its conditions better. Exhibits of\r\nPhilippine products were made at the world's fair in London in 1851\r\nand 1862. Telegraphic regulations were made in 1869.\r\n\r\nFor religious and educational influences of this period see the\r\nreligious appendix in our VOL. XXVIII, and the educational appendices\r\nin VOLS. XLV and XLVI. An important order of January 15, 1849, forbade\r\nthe religious orders to alienate their property. A decree of June 20,\r\n1849 gave the Recollects charge of the island of Negros, and they did\r\nconsiderable work there and developed the island somewhat, although\r\nthey but built on previous efforts, and did not accomplish as much\r\nas has been claimed. The reëstablished Society of Jesus was given\r\ncontrol of the mission work of Mindanao in 1861. The suppression of\r\nthe house of St. John of God in Manila and the establishment of the\r\nSisters of Charity were asked from the pope in 1852, at the time\r\nof the reëstablishment of the Jesuits. The conciliar seminaries\r\nwere given into charge of the Fathers of St. Vincent de Paul on\r\ntheir establishment in the islands. The Franciscans were allowed\r\nto maintain a college in Spain for the training of missionaries for\r\nthe Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe history of the development of the people during this period has\r\nbeen greatly neglected. There was a decided advance educationally\r\nand politically, as well as a growing discontent, that were due to\r\na complexity of factors, among which were the easier communication\r\nwith Spain, the greater number of Spaniards in the islands, and the\r\nspread of books and papers through the capital and provinces. On\r\nthe side of the government there were expeditions into the north\r\ncountry against the Igorots and other tribes. In the south there were\r\nalmost continual campaigns against the Moros, over whom some important\r\nvictories were obtained. The usual decrees ordering good treatment of\r\nthe natives were issued, with as little effect as of old. The liberal\r\npolicy that the government was inclined to adopt toward the natives\r\nis evidenced by the efforts made to secure educational laws, and by\r\nthe regulations of 1863. By an order of October 31, 1844, a casino\r\nwas opened for the natives in Manila. Another order prohibited the\r\nsmoking of opium by Chinese and natives. Discontent in the native\r\nbody is seen in the revolts of native soldiers and police. It was\r\nforbidden to carry arms without a license. The lottery established\r\nin 1850 had a bad influence. The vaccination board established at\r\nManila and the leper hospital established in 1850 at Cebú, were on\r\nthe other hand good measures, but were not welcomed so heartily as the\r\nlottery. The surreptitious introduction and circulation of books and\r\nplays caused the government in 1854 to attempt to regulate the book\r\ntrade. Government pawnshops were opened in 1860 in Manila. Pensions\r\nwere granted to the parents of those natives who were killed in the\r\nservice of the country. The earthquake of 1863 proved especially\r\ndisastrous, and the cholera epidemic of the same year, while not\r\nso severe as that of 1820, decimated the people considerably. The\r\nMoret decrees (see VOL. XLV, pp. 163-165) were distinctly in favor\r\nof the natives, but were never carried out. The discontent ever\r\ngrew more pronounced, and at last broke out actively in the Cavite\r\nrebellion, which was instigated and promoted by the secular clergy\r\nand others. There has been no attempt to do more than point out\r\ngeneral tendencies during this period, and to note some of the most\r\nimportant matters. For a good working bibliography, which will be\r\nfound to cover this period see Mr. LeRoy's article The Philippines,\r\n1860-1898--Some comment and bibliographical notes, which immediately\r\nprecedes the present document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTION OF THE LIGA FILIPINA\r\n\r\n\r\nEnds:\r\n\r\n1.

The remainder, whenever it exceeds the sum of ten pesos,\r\nshall be delivered to the Provincial Treasurer, to whom he shall\r\nshow his ledger, and himself writing in the ledger of the Provincial\r\nTreasurer the amount delivered. The Provincial Treasurer shall then\r\ngive a receipt, and if it is in accordance with the accounts, shall\r\nplace his O. K. in the ledger of the other. Like proceedings shall\r\nfollow when the Provincial Treasurer delivers funds in excess of ten\r\npesos to the Supreme Treasurer.\r\n\r\n5.

[178]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRIAR MEMORIAL OF 1898\r\n\r\n\r\nHis Excellency, the Minister of the colonies:\r\n\r\nWe, the superiors of the corporations of the Augustinians, Franciscans,\r\nRecollects, Dominicans, and Jesuits, established in Filipinas,\r\nin fulfilment of the statement of the telegram presented to his\r\nExcellency, the governor-general and viceroyal patron, [179] on\r\nthe first instant, to be transmitted officially to your Excellency,\r\nand which has been done by the said superior authority, as he has\r\ncondescended to inform us, have the honor of presenting this exposition\r\nto his Majesty, King Don Alfonso XIII (whom may God preserve), and in\r\nhis royal name, to her Majesty, the queen regent, Doña María Cristina,\r\nto the president and members [vocales] of the Council of Ministers\r\nof the Crown [Ministros de la Corona], [180] and most especially to\r\nyour Excellency, as minister of the colonies. We send it directly to\r\nyour Excellency, in accordance with law and custom, so that, in due\r\ntime, you may condescend to lay it before the lofty personages above\r\nmentioned, and even, if you deem it advisable, before the entire\r\nnation, duly assembled in the Cortes of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn writing this exposition, to us, the religious of the corporations\r\nexisting in the country from ancient times, united in one soul and\r\none heart, as faithful brethren, is reserved the honor in the very\r\nbeginning of fulfilling respectfully the most acceptable duty of\r\nreiterating our traditional adhesion to the king, to his government,\r\nand to all the authorities of the fatherland, to whom we have always\r\nconsidered it an honor to keep ourselves subject and obedient, by\r\nthe law of conscience, which is the strongest human bond, endeavoring\r\ncontinually and in all earthly things, from our respective sphere of\r\naction, to coöperate with every class of endeavor for the maintenance\r\nof public order in Filipinas, for its legitimate and holy progress,\r\nfor the development of its intellectual and even material interests;\r\nand, in a very special manner, for the propagation and conservation\r\nof the divine teachings of Catholicism, for the encouragement of\r\ngood morals, and for the security of the moral prestige, the only\r\nforce which has been until now the great bond of union between these\r\nbeautiful lands and their dear mother the mother-country [metrópoli].\r\n\r\nMotive for this exposition. Truly, your Excellency, if extremely\r\ntroublesome circumstances, by which Spanish authority in the\r\narchipelago is threatened, and the bitter campaign (or better,\r\nconspiracy) of defamation and anti-monastic schemes, incited against\r\nus, especially since the outbreak of the insurrection, did not compel\r\nus to talk, very willingly would we leave it to politicians to occupy\r\nthemselves with the problems that concern this country, and we would\r\nmaintain the silence that has fittingly been our norm of procedure\r\nfor many years, not speaking except when questioned officially, being\r\njealous, by that manner of retirement, of avoiding the criticism which\r\nhas so often been heaped upon us with audacious flippancy or malice,\r\nthat we meddle with the temporal government of these islands.\r\n\r\nBut now the hour is come, when, as loyal patriots and constant\r\nsupporters of Spanish authority in Filipinas, we must break that\r\nsilence, in order that one may never with reason repeat of us, either\r\nas religious or as subjects of España, that terrible accusation of the\r\nprophet, canes muti non valentes latrare. [181] The hour is come, also,\r\nwhen we must emerge in defense of our honor, atrociously blemished in\r\nmany ways, of our prestige that has been trampled upon, of our holy\r\nand patriotic ministry, which has, finally, been subjected to the most\r\nterrible calumnies and the most unqualified accusations. Though private\r\npersons may at any time make a noble renunciation of their good name\r\nthat has been defamed, offering to God the sacrifice of what civilized\r\nman esteems highest, never is that allowed in any form, according to\r\nthe teachings of the holy doctors of the Church, to public persons,\r\nto prelates, to superiors, to corporations, who must defend and\r\npreserve their prestige, their credit, and their reputation, in order\r\nto worthily fulfil their respective functions. A religious corporation\r\ndiscredited and publicly reviled, is in its class like a nation whose\r\nflag is insulted or whose laws are disavowed. It should die struggling\r\nfor its honor, rather than allow its good name to be trodden under\r\nfoot, and its rights to become unrecognized and unrevered.\r\n\r\nAbandonment of the religious corporations and their patience and\r\nprudence under these circumstances. Truly, one cannot qualify us\r\nas hasty and imprudent, in that we now address ourselves to the\r\nexalted authorities of the fatherland. We have borne patiently the\r\ncontinual insults and vilifications for more than eighteen months\r\nof masons and filibusters, open or hidden, in newspapers, clubs,\r\nand public assemblies, who have attributed to us the blame for the\r\ninsurrection, and heaped dishonor on our persons and ministries by\r\nthe most unjustifiable attacks, cast in their majority in the mold\r\nof demagogism and free thought. With Christian meekness have we\r\nendured the return to the Peninsula of a multitude of persons who\r\nhave resided a greater or less period in the islands, who have shown\r\nso little honor to our habit and profession; but if, instead of being\r\nreligious, we had been seculars, and if, instead of being a question\r\nof ecclesiastical corporations, it had been one of civil or military\r\ncorporations, they would have refrained from speaking ill of us--and\r\nwe can be quite sure of that, and there are eloquent daily proofs\r\nof this assertion--for the effective means that such corporations\r\ngenerally practice would have tied their tongues, and would have\r\nmade them recognize their flippancy and their injustice by imposing a\r\nvigorous corrective to their extensions. We religious have no sword;\r\nwe cannot pronounce judgment; we do not glitter with gilt braid; we\r\ndo not belong to a corporation, whose individual members take part\r\nin the government of the fatherland, or in exalted considerations\r\nof the same; we are neither military men nor functionaries of the\r\njudicial or administrative profession; we do not have weight in any\r\npolitical party; we do not intervene in elections; we do not form\r\n(for conscience forbids us) great federations that become feared;\r\nwe do not incite the public, except to obedience and submission\r\nto all constituted authority; we are unable in determined cases to\r\ndistribute appointments, or offer promotions or remunerations; we\r\nare not accompanied by a fattened retinue of friends or flatterers,\r\nwho defend us for their own personal advantage, and who are the blind\r\npaladins of the general, of the politician, of the exalted dignitary,\r\nof the opulent banker; neither have we any influence over the press;\r\nwe do not possess a nucleus of attached partisans to shout for us and\r\noverexcite so-called public opinion: in one word, we are without all\r\nthe methods that are used in modern public life to gain respect and\r\nfear, to influence the nation, and cause all the shots of slander or\r\nignorance to strike ineffectually against us.\r\n\r\nThe religious of Filipinas, far remote from Europa, alone in their\r\nministries, scattered even throughout the farthest recesses of the\r\narchipelago, without other associates and other witnesses of their\r\nlabors than their dear and simple parishioners, have no defense other\r\nthan their reason and right, which, although established on justice\r\nand law, and secured by the protection of the divine Providence--which\r\nmercifully has not failed us hitherto and which we hope will not\r\nfail us in the future--do not have, nevertheless, in their favor\r\n(nor ever, although we might have done so, would we avail ourselves\r\nof them) those most powerful modern auxiliaries which are attaining\r\nso much vogue and so great success in societies in which the great\r\nChristian sentiments having grown cold, reason is not heard easily\r\nunless supplied with the force of cannon or with the armor-plate of the\r\nhigh bench, of vast political parties, or of fearful popular movements.\r\n\r\nAlone with our reason and our right, although with our conscience\r\nsatisfied at always having fulfilled, yea always, our duties, of having\r\nbeen as patriotic as the greatest, or more so, and of having fulfilled\r\nthe obligations of our sacred ministry, we have endured silently and\r\nin all patience, in accordance with the advice of the apostle, the\r\ninsults and vilifications, even of persons to whom we have offered\r\nin Christian sincerity our affection and civilities, even by persons\r\nwho call themselves very Catholic, but who, perchance, infected with\r\nthe contagion of the practical Jansenism of certain present-day\r\nreformers, forget the remark of that great Christian emperor, who\r\nsaid that if he should see a priest who had fallen into any frailty,\r\nhe would cover him with his cloak, rather than publish his weakness.\r\n\r\nAlone, with our reason and our right, and confident that reason would\r\nat last clear the pathway, and that light would at last illumine the\r\ndense obscurity created by hatred of sect, by the separatist spirit,\r\nand by flippancy, envy, and the false zeal of certain persons, we\r\nhave endured the insinuations, made in the Cortes [parlamento] [182]\r\nof last year which showed scant respect to the orders; the assertions\r\nmade, not only in private, but also in centers of great publicity,\r\nand by persons of considerable popularity in military circles\r\n[politica militante], that the religious prestige of Filipinas was\r\nso broken that it was necessary to substitute it with armed force;\r\nthe publishing of the recourse of an eminent politician, sacrificed\r\nby anarchy, to the orders for information and advice in Philippine\r\nmatters, as a dishonorable censure; the grave accusations directed\r\nagainst us, as well as against a most worthy prelate, in a memorial\r\npresented to the senate, although veiled under certain appearances\r\nof impartiality and gentle correction; the different-toned clamoring\r\nfrom day to day, with more or less crudity, in order that the historic\r\npeninsular period of 1834-40 might be reproduced in the islands, and\r\nin order that measures might be adopted against us, so radical that\r\nthey are not taken (and the discussion of them is shameful) either\r\nagainst the centers of public immorality, or against societies and\r\nattempts that have no other end than to discatholicize the nation\r\nand to sow in it the germs of thorough social upheaval.\r\n\r\nWhy the religious have been silent until now. We believed and thought\r\nthat our prudence and long silence, adorned with the qualities of\r\ncircumspection and magnanimity which religious institutions should\r\nalways possess, ought to be sufficient for discreet and fair-minded\r\npeople, so that they would immediately impugn those accusations and\r\nform a judgment by which those repeated attacks would not make a\r\ndent in our credit and prestige. We supposed that that campaign of\r\ndiatribes and reproaches would vanish at last as a summer cloud formed\r\nby the effluvia cast off from the forges of masonry and filibusterism.\r\n\r\nBut instead of being dissipated the storm appears to be increasing\r\ndaily. The treaty of Biac-na-bató [183] has again placed in the\r\nmouth of many the crafty assertion, made now by the rebel leaders\r\nthat the institutes of the regulars have been the only cause of the\r\ninsurrection. The secret society [184] of the Katipunan, which is\r\nextending itself throughout the islands like a terrible plague, has\r\nestablished by order of its Gran Oriente, [185] the extinction of\r\nthe religious as one of the first articles of their program of race\r\nhatred. In the Peninsula and here, the masons, and all those who,\r\nin one way or another, second them, have rejuvenated [recrudecido]\r\ntheir war against us. Manifestos have been published in Madrid, in\r\nwhich misusing the names of Filipinas, measures highly disrespectful\r\nand vexatious to the clergy are demanded. Even in the ministry of the\r\ncolonies, although officiously, persons have managed to introduce\r\nthemselves, who, pursued by the tribunals of justice as unfaithful\r\ndo not hide their animadversion to the religious corporations. Now,\r\nif we were to continue silent in view of all these circumstances,\r\nour silence would be taken with reason as cowardice, or as an argument\r\nof guilt; our patience would be qualified as weakness; and even firm\r\nand sensible Catholics who recognize the injustice of the attacks\r\ndirected upon us, could with reason infer that we were stained, or\r\nthat we had come to such a prostrate condition that one could with\r\nimpunity insult and mock us, as if in downright truth we were old\r\nand decayed entities whose decadence is the last symptom of death.\r\n\r\nPrius mori, quam foedari, [186] said the ancients; and the most\r\nloyal Maccabæans, \"It is better to die in the battle than to\r\nsee the extermination of our nation and of the sanctuary.\" [187]\r\nAs long as the corporations exist, they will glory, as they ought,\r\nin repeating with St. Paul: \"Quamdiu sum Apostolus, ministerium meum\r\nhonorificabo.\" [188] We have always endeavored to honor our ministry,\r\nand we shall always continue to honor it, now and in the future,\r\nby the grace of God, which we trust will not fail us. Consequently,\r\nwe do not vacillate in addressing ourselves today to the exalted\r\nauthorities of the nation, taking shelter in our confidence, that,\r\nthough we are poor and helpless, and have no other protection than\r\nour spotless history, our immaculate honor, and our secure rights, we\r\nare talking to those in whom intelligence and good sense are brothers\r\nto nobility of thought, who are always ready to listen, especially\r\nto the poor and weak, and in whom their respect and love to Catholic\r\ninstitutions and to the so eminently glorious and meritorious title\r\n\"Regular Clergy of Filipinas,\" shelter them from the suggestions of\r\nsects and the prejudice of anticlerical and separatist parties.\r\n\r\nThey are persecuted because of their religious significance. What\r\nreason have the religious corporations of Filipinas given that they\r\nshould be persecuted with so great passion? Ah! your Excellency, that\r\nreason is no other than because they are very Catholic, because they\r\nare very Spanish, because they are effective supporters of the good\r\nand sane doctrine, and because they have never shown weakness toward\r\nthe enemies of God and of the fatherland. [189] If we religious had\r\nnot defended here with inviolable firmness the secular work which our\r\nfathers bequeathed us: if we had shrunk our shoulders in fear before\r\nthe work of the lodges and before the propagation of politico-religious\r\nerrors that have come to us from Europa; if we had given the most\r\ninsignificant sign, not only if not of sympathy, yet even the least\r\nsign of mute passivity, to the advocates of the false modern liberties\r\ncondemned by the Church; if the flame of patriotism had become lessened\r\nto us; and innovators had not met in each religious in Filipinas an\r\nunchangeable and terrible adversary to their plans, open or hidden:\r\nnever, your Excellency, would we religious corporations have been\r\nthe object of the cruel persecution now practiced on us; but on\r\nthe contrary, we regulars would have been exalted to the clouds,\r\nand so much the more as our enemies are not unaware that, granting\r\nthe influence that we enjoy in the archipelago, our support, even if\r\npassive and one of mere silence, would indisputably have given them\r\nthe victory.\r\n\r\nBut they know that our banner is none other than the Syllabus of\r\nthe great pontiff, Pius IX, [190] which has been so often confirmed\r\nby Leo XIII, in which all rebellion against legitimate authorities\r\nis so vigorously condemned. They know that, as lovers of the only\r\ntrue liberty--Christian liberty--we would rather die than consent,\r\nin whatever pertains to us, to the least lack of the purity of the\r\ninfallible Catholic teachings, of the holiness of Christian customs,\r\nand of the most complete loyalty due the Spanish nation. Consequently,\r\nthey hate us; consequently, veiled under divers names and with\r\ndivers pretexts, they are making so cruel war upon us, that one\r\nwould believe that the masons and filibusters have no other enemies\r\nin Filipinas than the religious corporations. In such wise does that\r\nhonor us that we can very well say with the prince of the apostles:\r\n\"If you be reproached for the name of Christ, you shall be blessed:\r\nfor that which is of the honor, glory, and power of God, and that\r\nwhich is his spirit resteth upon you (1 Peter iv, 14).\" [191]\r\n\r\nAnd for their patriotic significance. Apart from their essentially\r\nreligious character, the regulars of the archipelago have another\r\nsignificance that makes them odious to the separatists. They are the\r\nonly permanent and deeply-rooted Spanish institution in the islands,\r\nwith a suitable and rigorous organization, perfectly adapted to these\r\nregions. While the other Peninsulars live here in the fulfilment\r\nof their duty more or less time, as is convenient to their private\r\ninterests, and with no other bond that follows them to Filipinas\r\nthan their own convenience, being ignorant of the language of the\r\ncountry and having no other relations with the natives than those of\r\na superficial intercourse, we religious come here to sacrifice our\r\nwhole life. We form as it were a net of soldiers of religion and of the\r\nfatherland in the archipelago, scattered even to the remotest villages\r\nof the islands. Here we have our history, our glories, the ancestral\r\nhouse, so to speak, of our family. Bidding an eternal farewell to our\r\nnative soil, we condemn ourselves voluntarily, by virtue of our vows,\r\nto live forever consecrated to the moral, religious, and political\r\neducation of these natives, for whose defense we have in all ages\r\nwaged campaigns, which, without the pious boastings [crudezas]\r\nand exaggerations of Las Casas, [192] have constantly reproduced in\r\nFilipinas the figure of the immortal defender of the American natives.\r\n\r\nCraftiness of the insurgent leaders of filibusterism. In this point\r\nit must be confessed that the insurgent leaders of filibusterism\r\nare logical. \"Do the regulars,\" they have asked themselves, \"who\r\nare the Spaniards most deeply-rooted and most influential in the\r\ncountry, and the most beloved and respected by the people, agree\r\nto, or will they ever agree to our projects? Then let us petition\r\ntheir expulsion, and their disappearance in one way or another. If\r\nwe do not succeed in it, let us destroy them. Since there are many\r\npeninsulars, who, influenced by modern errors or carried away by\r\nignorance or evil passion, lend ear to those who inveigh against\r\nthe religious, let us inveigh loudly. Let us form a powerful cry\r\nagainst them. Let us conspire in lodges and political clubs. Let us\r\npetition at any risk measures looking to the lowering and destruction\r\nof the regular clergy. Those peninsulars will listen to us without\r\nus having any fear that they will hold us as filibusters. It will be\r\nsaid of us that we are liberals, that we are reformers, that we are\r\ndemocrats, that we are even masons and free-thinkers: but that does not\r\nmatter. Many peninsulars are the same. They also inveigh against the\r\nreligious. They also petition freedom of thought, freedom of the press,\r\nfreedom of association, secularization of education, ecclesiastical\r\ndisamortization, suppression of the privileges of the clergy. They\r\nalso inveigh against the terrible theocracy, and do not cease to\r\ndefame the religious and to impute to them all sorts of crimes.\"\r\n\r\nThat, your Excellency, is the watchword that has been given to\r\nall the filibusters, and to all who will procure the emancipation\r\nof the country in one way or another, for their separatist ends,\r\nand especially since the treaty of Biac-na-bató. \"There is nothing\r\nagainst España, nothing against the king, nothing against the army,\r\nnothing against the Spanish administration: say if you have seized\r\narms that it has been exclusively because of the abuses of the clergy,\r\nthat you were not attempting separation from the mother-country;\r\nthat you wished only modern liberties and the disappearance of the\r\norders. And even though all the documents, judicial and extrajudicial,\r\nin which appear the plans of the conspirators, and all the acts of\r\nthe canton of Cavite, during its ephemeral emancipation, demonstrates\r\nthe contrary, let us exert ourselves to say that that was not the\r\nintention of the rebels, that that was an affair of some enthusiasts\r\nor madmen, but that the great mass of the insurgents seized arms only\r\nthrough coveting those liberties. The multitude of lay Spaniards of\r\nevery class and profession sacrificed; the countless natives killed or\r\nharassed in innumerable ways, because of their unswerving loyalty to\r\nthe fatherland; the cries of 'Death to the Castilas!' and 'Long live\r\nthe Tagálogs!' the stamps of a Tagálog republic, a Filipino republic,\r\n[193] an army of freedom; the speeches and circulars of the assembly\r\nor supreme council; the fiery Katipunan constitution written in\r\ncharacters of a mysterious key, and that written at Biac-na-bató;\r\nand in their style, an infinite number of deeds and documents, many\r\nof them very recent, which even to satiety evidently demonstrate the\r\nanti-Spanish and separatist character of the insurrection: all that\r\nwe shall now conceal by crying 'Down with the friars!' 'Long live\r\ndemocratic liberties!' 'Long live España!' and with those cries are\r\nwe certain of being heard, and in that way shall we be able to more\r\neasily attain the final goal of our desires.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the logic and the tactics of the filibusters, and it must be\r\nconfessed that in it they show themselves to possess practical talent,\r\nand to be thoroughly acquainted with the society that surrounds\r\nthem. Had they said that the insurrection had been provoked by the\r\nexcesses of the government employes, of the military, of the governors,\r\nof the directors of the treasury; had they placed in relief the\r\nmultitude of abuses that have been committed against the native in\r\none form or another (although never by the nation, or by the majority\r\nof its sons); had they attributed the armed insurrection to that:\r\nthey would now be opposed by all the peninsular element, and their\r\nvoice would have had not the slightest echo, as it would have been\r\nstifled by the more powerful voice of others who would have cried\r\nout in defense of the Spanish name, and who would have locked on them\r\nthe door to all the means of propaganda and agitation which they are\r\nnow exploiting. But when they declaimed against the clergy, when they\r\ndemanded the liberties that the clergy cannot in conscience approve,\r\nthey had at least assured their campaign, and in part, perhaps,\r\nthe success of the same.\r\n\r\nTheir real purposes. Does not this show, your Excellency, that,\r\nin talking of the supposed or enormously exaggerated abuses of the\r\nclergy, they are not moved by love of justice and morality, and much\r\nless by love for España? What then, do they not recognize that for one\r\nreligious who has committed abuses, it is to be surmised, from their\r\nemployment, that there have been many more laymen in proportion (and\r\nlet it be clear that we accuse no one, and least of all the worthy\r\nofficial corporations) who have converted their office, totally or\r\npartially, into a means for illegal advancement? Have the insurgents\r\nnot cried out at other times, and during the preparatory period of\r\nthe insurrection, against the meritorious civil guard, against judges\r\nand alcaldes, against the army, against the peninsular resident in\r\nthe island, against the administration in general, and even against\r\nthe superior authorities of the archipelago? Is not this proved\r\nby the books of the unfortunate Rizal, by the Solidaridad, [194]\r\nand other documents and pamphlets of the laborers, although one must\r\nnot forget that their favorite watchword was always to cruelly attack\r\nthe religious? Undoubtedly so, but it was not now advisable for them\r\nto declare it. Now was come the opportunity to show themselves very\r\nSpanish, very loyal to the king (they who were affiliating themselves\r\nto the extent of their ability with the most radical parties), very\r\nfond of the army, and to attack only the religious!\r\n\r\nAccusations against the orders. They work deceitfully, we shall say\r\nwith the Psalmist (Psalm 35), [195] they talk of peace and of love\r\noutwardly, but evil and hate are hid in their hearts; supervacue\r\nexprobaverunt animam meam. Most vainly do they wrong us, we shall add,\r\nin respect to the accusations that they direct against us. \"Unjust\r\nwitnesses rising up have asked me things I knew not. They repaid me\r\nevil for good: and have sworn my destruction. But thou, O Lord, wilt\r\ndestroy their plans, and wilt save my existence.\" (Psalm 35.) [196]\r\n\r\nYea, your Excellency, unjust witnesses, for where are those abuses,\r\nthose excesses, those vices, those outrages, of which their mouths\r\nare so full, and which furnish them matter for their speeches of a\r\ndemagogical club of the rabble? What do the religious corporations\r\nmaintain, when viewed with a deep synthetical standard, which is\r\nnot in accordance with the canons of the Church and the rules of\r\ntheir institute; which is not fitting to the holy ministry that they\r\nprofess; which is not greatly beneficial to the supreme interests\r\nof the fatherland? We turn our eyes in all directions, and however\r\nquick-sighted may be our eyes, unless one views the orders through\r\nthe pharisaical or separatist prism, they discover nothing that does\r\nnot merit the heartiest applause. \"Laudet te alienus,\" says the sacred\r\nbook of Proverbs, \"et non os tuum.\" [197] But it is not our intention\r\nto praise ourselves here. It is our intention to vindicate ourselves;\r\nto defend our honor unjustly impeached; to demonstrate our eminently\r\nSpanish mission; and to maintain our good name, which is our treasure,\r\nwhich is the great title of nobility that we can never abdicate\r\nnor allow to be vilified. \"By your good works stop the mouth of the\r\nignorance of foolish and senseless men,\" says St. Peter to us. (1\r\nPeter ii, 15.) [198]\r\n\r\n\"We walk not in craftiness, nor by adulterating the word of God;\r\nbut by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's\r\nconscience, in the sight of God; that is our glory, the testimony of\r\nour conscience,\" is also taught us by St. Paul. (2 Cor. iv, 2.) [199]\r\nFrom our dishonor follows the dishonor of the holy and Spanish mission\r\nthat we exercise; and God has told us that we should be the salt of\r\nthe earth and the light of the world, and that we should shine in\r\nsuch manner that men may see our good works, and glorify our father\r\nwho is in heaven. [200]\r\n\r\nHow they have fulfilled their duties. Our good works are in the gaze\r\nof all men, and our good works, thanks to God, are the brightest\r\ngem of the corporations. Not only do we preach the gospel here; not\r\nonly do we carry the Christian and civilized life to the barbarous\r\nand fetish-encumbered inhabitants of these islands; not only did we\r\nobtain the incorporation of the archipelago into the Spanish crown,\r\nworking in harmony with the other official entities, and preserved it,\r\nas is well known, in a peaceful and happy condition for the space\r\nof three centuries; but also, in all time, even now when we are\r\nwronged so deeply by some ingrate Filipinos, whom we pity, have we\r\nbeen the constant defenders of the Indians, enduring for that reason\r\ninnumerable loathings, and all kinds of persecution on the part of\r\nmany peninsulars, who did not understand the devotion and patriotism\r\nof our conduct. In all time have we been zealous for the purity\r\nof the faith and for the conservation of good morals; and illegal\r\nexactions, bribery, extortions, outrages, ease, immoral gambling,\r\nand a licentious or little restrained life, have always had in us a\r\nsevere judge and the most inexorable censor.\r\n\r\nCan it be said of the religious institutes, whether collectively\r\nor in the vast majority of their individual members, that they have\r\nprevaricated; that they have ever abandoned the duties entrusted to\r\nthem in the administration of the sacraments, in the celebration\r\nof divine worship, in Christian preaching and catechising, in the\r\nvigilance of good manners, in the tutelage of moral interests, in\r\nprotection and relief to the needy and weak, in advice and consolation\r\nto all about us, in the maintenance of obedience to the mother-country,\r\nin the extension of education, in the campaign against every kind of\r\nsuperstition and erroneous practice, in repression of concubinage, and\r\nof other public irregularities and scandals? Does not the tenet enter\r\nthe head of the most exalted sectarian, if he has any lucid moment,\r\nthat we religious have fulfilled with assiduous self-abnegation the\r\nobligations of our ministry?\r\n\r\nWe have become wearied with reading, your Excellency, whatever has\r\nbeen written and published against us for years, and we know also how\r\nmuch is said now in assemblies and gatherings. With our hand upon our\r\nheart, with our foreheads raised aloft, as one who walks in the light\r\nand fears not to have his deeds examined and discussed in the light,\r\nwe challenge and defy our detractors and calumniators, and those\r\nwho flippantly, or by any other unjust and inaccurate motive, talk\r\nand murmur, to show us with exact data and with perfectly authentic\r\ninformation, not only the accuracy of all their accusations, but\r\nthe mere probability of whatever they allege against our honor and\r\nwell-established credit, touching the fulfilment of our duties,\r\nboth religious and patriotic.\r\n\r\nTheir procedure in respect to parochial obventions, to education,\r\nand intercourse with intelligent persons. It is said that we commit\r\nabuse in the exaction of parochial fees. Let the laws of the Church be\r\nconsulted, let the doctrines of the moralists and the principles of\r\npositive natural and divine law be cited; and then submitted to that\r\nonly sure rule as a criterion, let them tell us whether we abuse the\r\npublic in that matter, and whether our procedure, within just bounds,\r\nis not that employed by the most disinterested priests.\r\n\r\nIt is said that we are hostile to education and the advancement\r\nof knowledge. But if by education and knowledge, doctrines not\r\ncondemned by the Church, our Mother, are not meant, let them tell us\r\nwhether the islands have any education that has not been established,\r\nprotected, sustained, and encouraged by the clergy, in all branches\r\nof instruction, both primary, and secondary and superior.\r\n\r\nIt is said that we despise the intelligent men of the country, and that\r\nwe make them the object of every kind of persecution. That assertion is\r\nso rare and stupendous that we wonder whether our enemies will write in\r\nimaginary spaces. A multitude of youths are graduated annually with the\r\ndegree of bachelor or after the conclusion of some higher course, from\r\nthe Ateneo Municipal, from the colleges of Manila and the provinces,\r\nand from the university. We are honored by the friendship of the\r\nvast majority of them, and take no little satisfaction in seeing\r\nthem prosper and in knowing that they respect the Christian and\r\nsolid education that they have received. It is known that very few\r\nof the great number of students that attend our lecture halls, and\r\nof the not few graduates that are scattered throughout the islands,\r\nhave taken part in the rebellion; and that the vast majority of them\r\nhave kept loyal to España, in fulfilment of the oath that they took\r\non receiving the investiture of their professions. But what happens\r\nin the old world with the apprentices of free thought happens here:\r\nall those modestly call themselves intelligent who think that they\r\nexhibit signs of knowledge and talent by showing contempt for priests\r\nand religious; while it is a fact that a goodly proportion of those\r\nwho express themselves in that manner have been unable to complete\r\ntheir courses with us, and are the refuse of our lecture halls.\r\n\r\nRegarding the sanctity of their private life. An outcry is being made\r\nagainst the vices and immorality of the regulars in terms that seem to\r\nbe inspired in Protestant and anticlerical centers of low quality. But\r\nin that, as in other things, saving what can never be avoided even in\r\nthe communities most sanely organized, by the severest legislation\r\nand the most exquisite care, all who view us near at hand are not\r\nignorant that nothing can be thrown into our face.\r\n\r\nThe words of Father St. Augustine, when defending his institute against\r\naccusations similar to those directed against the orders of Filipinas,\r\nare very opportune and efficacious in this matter. \"Tell me, brethren,\r\nis my congregation, peradventure, better than Noah's ark, in which,\r\nof the three sons Noah had, one was evil? Is it, peradventure, better\r\nthan the family of the patriarch Jacob, in which, of his twelve sons,\r\nonly Joseph is praised? Is it, peradventure, better than the house of\r\nthe patriarch Isaac, in which, of the two sons born to him, one was\r\nchosen of God, and the other damned? Is it, peradventure, better than\r\nthe household of Jesus Christ, our Savior, in which, of His twelve\r\napostles, one was a traitor, and sold him? Is it, peradventure, better\r\nthan that company of the seven deacons filled with the Holy spirit,\r\nchosen by the apostles to take charge of the poor and widowed, among\r\nwhom one, by name Nicholas, became a heresiarch? Is it, peradventure,\r\nbetter than heaven itself, whence fell so many angels? Can it be\r\nbetter than the earthly paradise, where the two first parents of all\r\nthe human race, created in original justice and grace, fell?\"\r\n\r\nAh! the religious corporations of Filipinas, caring for the sanctity\r\nand salvation of all its sons, on seeing one of their individual\r\nmembers fail in his duties, after correcting him, and after taking,\r\nin accordance with law and religious prudence, measures efficacious\r\nto repair, if he did it, the scandal, and even, if necessary, to\r\ndestroy and fling aside the rotten branch, cry out in pity with the\r\napostle like a true mother: \"Quis infirmatur et ego non infirmor? Quis\r\nscandalizatur et ego non uror?\" \"Who becomes sick spiritually and I do\r\nnot suffer with him? Who suffers scandal and I am not burned?\" That is\r\nwhat all should say who learn of the backslidings of their neighbor;\r\nthat is the dictate of charity and of justice; that is demanded by\r\nrespect and consideration to the ministers of the church. And so long\r\nas our systematic accusers do not prove that the orders consent and\r\ndo not check the sins, in great part humanly inevitable--considering\r\nthe conditions under which those dedicated to the ministry live--of\r\nthe very few religious who have the misfortune and weakness to fall,\r\nthey have no right to dishonor us and to cry out against what we are\r\nthe first to lament and to try to correct.\r\n\r\nWill they prove it sometime? We are quite assured of the opposite;\r\nand that though they have at hand, as many methods of inquisition\r\nand proof as the judge most interested in any cause can desire. Our\r\nconvents, our ministries, our persons, are in sight of all. Our parish\r\npriests and missionaries are alone and surrounded by a multitude of\r\nnatives. Whatever we say, do, or neglect to do, is seen and spied\r\nby all the people. Our habitations are of crystal for all classes\r\nof people. Our publicity as Europeans and our condition as priests\r\nplace us in such relief in the missions and parishes, that it would be\r\nstupid simplicity to try to hide our doings and actions. Consequently,\r\neverything is favorable to our adversaries in the trial to which we\r\nprovoke them, and to which each regular voluntarily submits himself,\r\nfrom the moment that, faithful to his vocation and obedient to his\r\nsuperiors, he sacrifices himself to live among these natives, his very\r\nbeloved sheep of the flock of Christ. Our honor, our reputation rests\r\nin their hands. It would be easy for our adversaries to confound the\r\nreligious institutes if truth presided over their accusations. But\r\nsince truth is that which does not glitter in their words, the saying\r\nof Holy Writ becomes verified in their conduct: \"They spake against me\r\nwith a lying tongue, and with the speech of hate did they attack me;\"\r\nand in regard to us the saying of St. Peter: \"You shall keep an upright\r\nconscience with modesty and fear, so that as many as calumniate your\r\nupright procedure in Christ, shall be confounded.\" [201]\r\n\r\nOther equally unjust charges. We shall not compare our conduct\r\nwith that of the respectable and very estimable native priests of\r\nthe secular clergy, whom the majority of the separatist Filipinos\r\nflatter, undoubtedly because it is not to the purpose of their plans\r\nto combat them. We shall not rebut the shamelessness of supposing that\r\npart of our property has a criminal origin, and that we are certain\r\ndespots in our rural estates who suck the blood of our tenants by\r\nvarious methods, an infamy so often refuted with authentic data\r\nof overwhelming proof. We shall not speak of the vast imposture of\r\nimputing to us all the executions by shooting, imprisonments, tortures,\r\ntrials, and confiscation of property of those implicated in the last\r\ninsurrection. We scorn the absurd fable that we are absolute masters,\r\nnot only of consciences, but of all the archipelago, at the same time\r\nthat they, obviously contradicting themselves, as error is wont to do,\r\ndeclare that our prestige and influence in the islands is lost. We\r\nneglect to attribute to ourselves whatever hate and censure, according\r\nto them, have been made in the country by the military [institutos\r\narmados], the governors, the judges, and all the public organisms, in\r\ndeportations and other kinds of punishment; as if we religious managed\r\nto our liking the machine of the government and administration of this\r\nterritory, and as if, from the governor-general down to the last agent\r\nof the police, all were but the blind executors of our will. We lay\r\naside those and other things--poorly executed arguments--which certain\r\nmisguided sons of this country are still employing, and which are\r\nunfortunately repeated by certain peninsulars, in order to manifest\r\ntheir hatred or prejudice against the clergy; and pass on to speak\r\nof the insurrection and of the imperious necessity of remedying the\r\nextremely embarrassing situation of the religious corporations in\r\nthe archipelago.\r\n\r\nFundamental causes of the insurrection, and who are to blame for\r\nit. The government is able only too well to recognize the causes that\r\nhave produced the insurrection, and we shall not be the ones who try\r\nto give it lessons in that regard. The government is aware that until\r\nseveral years ago, every separatist idea, every rebel tendency in the\r\ncountry, which was enjoying the most enviable peace and felt respect to\r\nauthority with the same unreflecting, although patent and holy, force,\r\nwith which domestic authority in all parts is obeyed and respected,\r\nwas exotic and an anachronism. Then was submission to España and\r\nsubordination to all authority an element truly social, rendered\r\nincarnate by the religious in the mass of the Filipino population,\r\nwhich neither dreamed, yea, your Excellency, neither dreamed of ideas\r\nof political redemption, nor imagined that, in order to keep themselves\r\nloyal to the mother-country, one single bayonet was necessary in the\r\ncountry. The public force of the cuadrilleros and of the guardia civil\r\n[202] (the latter of very recent creation) was necessarily created to\r\ncheck and restrain thieves and tulisanes; [203] while every one thought\r\nthat the wretched army then in the archipelago had no other object than\r\nto combat Mindanaos and Joloans, and to be ready for any conflict with\r\nthe neighboring powers. España was able to be sure of its dominion\r\nhere, and to live so carelessly, with respect to political movements\r\nas in the most retired village of the Peninsula. All authority was\r\nobeyed, was respected, by conscience, by education, by tradition,\r\nby social habit, passively and by custom, if one wishes, but with\r\nso great strength and firmness, with so indisputable and universal\r\nsubmission, that more indeed than individual virtue it was the virtue\r\nof the mass of the whole population, it was the spontaneous homage\r\nto God, which, represented in the powers of the fatherland, all felt\r\nand practiced, not conceiving even the possibility of rebellions\r\nand insurrections. Thus had they been taught by the religious, who\r\nalways unite the names of God and His Church with the names of their\r\nking and of España. Consequently, by bonds of conscience, did all the\r\narchipelago love and obey him, and no one thought then of political\r\nliberties, nor in lifting yokes that existed for no one.\r\n\r\nAre there then no abuses? No, your Excellency it could have very well\r\nhappened that there were abuses on a greater scale than in the epoch\r\nimmediately preceding the present events. But since these people\r\nwere educated in the doctrine that it is never legal to disobey\r\nauthority, under pretext of abuses, even if some are true; since\r\nthese people had not yet been imbued with the new modern teachings,\r\ncondemned a hundred times by the Church; since no one had spoken\r\nhere of popular rights, many of them as false as senseless; since\r\nthe propaganda against priests and religious had not yet reached\r\nFilipinas: it resulted that, considering those abuses, as one of so\r\nmany plagues of humanity (from which regulated societies are not free,\r\naccording to the principles of the newest erroneous law, but rather\r\nthey are, on the contrary, suffered with greater intensity and with\r\ngreater loss to the fundamental interests of the social order) these\r\ninhabitants tolerated them patiently, and had recourse for their\r\nremedy to the just methods taught in such cases by Catholic ethics,\r\nwith the greatest advantage to individuals and to nations.\r\n\r\nConsequently, as many as have contributed, in one way or another,\r\nto introduce those revolutionary doctrines, and those germs of social\r\nand political disturbance into the archipelago, whether peninsulars or\r\nislanders, of whatever class or rank, are the true authors, conscious\r\nor unconscious, of the great weakening of the traditional obedience\r\nto the mother-country, of which the whole archipelago was in peaceful\r\npossession until thirty years ago, that was disturbed by no one or by\r\nno influence. The introducers of those doctrines and tendencies are\r\nbeyond all doubt the culprits of the insurrection, for they are the\r\nones who have done their utmost to prepare for it and with success to\r\nunroll it, even supposing that they have not directly and deliberately\r\nprocured it.\r\n\r\nWho sows the wind will reap the whirlwind; who introduces principles\r\nmust accept the consequences; who generates hate must not wonder that\r\nwar results; who teaches the pathway of evil cannot declare himself\r\nfree from responsibility for the disorders originated by his teaching.\r\n\r\nPartial causes: masonry. Will it be necessary to explain this simple\r\nconsideration? We do not think so. But should we desire to unfold it,\r\nit would be easy for us to add that the anti-religious propaganda;\r\nthe ideas of erroneous liberty and forbidden independence, incited\r\nand aroused in certain Filipinos by European politicians and writers;\r\nthe antipathy and opposition, clearly shown by certain Spaniards, even\r\nby those ruling and by government employees, against the religious\r\ncorporations; the establishment of masonry and of other secret\r\nsocieties, the former's legitimate offspring; the most favorable\r\nreception that the revolutionary Filipinos found for their plans\r\nin many centers and papers of Madrid and other places; the lack of\r\nreligion in many peninsulars; the ease with which the ancient laws\r\nof Filipinas have been changed; the mobility of public functionaries\r\nwhich, giving opportunity for many irregularities, has contributed\r\ngreatly to the continual lessening of the credit of the Spanish name;\r\nand in part, the backwardness, which has been observed sometimes in\r\nthe sons of the country with regard to public appointments: [all\r\nthese] are partial aspects, various phases and confluent factors\r\n(of which we do not attempt to enumerate all) of the fundamental and\r\nsynthetical cause that we have expressed.\r\n\r\nNo one is unaware that the chief of all those partial phases and\r\nfactors of the social disorganization of the archipelago has been\r\nmasonry. The Asociación Hispano-Filipina of Madrid was masonic. Those\r\nwho encouraged the Filipinos in their campaign against the clergy\r\nand against the peninsulars here resident, were masons in almost\r\ntheir totality. Those who authorized the installation of lodges in\r\nthe archipelago were masons. Those who founded the Katipunan, [204]\r\na society so mortally masonic, that even in its terrible suggestive\r\npact of blood it has done naught but imitate the masonic carbonarios,\r\nwere masons.\r\n\r\nPractical consequences of that. The traditional submission to the\r\nfatherland, diffused and deeply settled in the archipelago by the\r\nreligious corporations, having disappeared in part and having been\r\ngreatly weakened in part; the voice of the parish priest, thanks to the\r\nabove-mentioned propaganda, having been disregarded by many natives,\r\nespecially in Manila and conterminous provinces, who were taught in\r\nthat way to give themselves airs as intelligent and independent men;\r\nthe prestige of the Spanish name having been greatly tempered, and the\r\nancient respect with which every peninsular was formerly regarded in\r\nthe islands having been almost annihilated in many towns: is it strange\r\nthat race instincts should have asserted themselves strongly, and,\r\nconsidering that they have a distinct language, and distinct lands and\r\nclimate, that they should have discussed and have attempted to raise\r\na wall of separation between Spaniards and Malays? Is it not logical\r\nthat, after having been made to believe that the religious is not the\r\nfather and shepherd of their souls and their friend and enthusiastic\r\ndefender, but a vile exploiter, and that the peninsular here is no\r\nmore than a trader constituted with greater or less authority and\r\nrank, that they should madly and illegally have imagined that they\r\ncould easily separate from España and aspire to self-government?\r\n\r\nGloomy situation of the archipelago and omens of its future. We\r\nshall not insist, your Excellency, on this order of consideration,\r\nfor it rends our soul, it cleaves our heart in twain, to consider how\r\neasily so many rivers of blood, so great and extravagant expenses,\r\nand so extraordinary conflicts, might have been spared, which in a\r\nnot long lapse of time, may, perhaps, result in the disappearance\r\nof the immortal flag of Castilla; how easily the military situation,\r\noriginated by the insurrection, a situation that was threatening to\r\nmake of Filipinas another Cuba, might have been avoided; and with how\r\nlittle trouble the archipelago might have been continuing at present\r\nin the same tranquillity and peacefully progressive situation as it\r\nhad years ago: if having the power, as was a fact, but that was not\r\nattempted or thought of, the door had been shut on the disturbers; if\r\nmasonry had never been allowed in the country; and if every tendency\r\ncontrary to the moral prestige, the most powerful social bond,\r\nimmensely superior to all armies and all political institutions which\r\nunited these countries with their beloved and respected mother-country,\r\nhad been effectively restrained in their beginnings.\r\n\r\nHas the present most gloomy situation any remedy?\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat difficult, and even dangerous, to answer the question,\r\nfor if the Katipunan was six months ago relegated to the hills of\r\nLaguna and Bulacan among the rebel leaders who were fugitive there,\r\nor was dragging out a shameful existence in certain villages that were\r\nin communication with the insurgents, today the plague has spread. For\r\nthe ones pardoned at Biac-na-bató, breaking the promise given to\r\nthe gallant and energetic marquis de Estella, [205] obedient to the\r\nwatchword received, have spread through the central provinces; and by\r\nusing threats and terrible punishments, which have no precedents in the\r\npages of history, nor even of the novel, have succeeded in attracting\r\nto their ranks a great number of Indians, even in villages which gave\r\neloquent proof of loyalty to the holy cause of the Spanish fatherland\r\nbefore the submission of Biac-na-bató. They have also succeeded in\r\nestablishing themselves in Cápiz and in other points of the Visayas:\r\nand indeed the movement of Zambales, of Pangasinan, of Ilocos, of Cebú,\r\nand of the Katipunans, are at present open in Manila.\r\n\r\nThe thought of what may happen to this beautiful country at any\r\nmoment terrifies us, for we do not know to what point sectarian\r\nfanaticism may go, exploiting the suggestibility of this race and\r\ntheir weak brain by the deeds that they are heralding, brought to a\r\nhead by them, in regard to the army, whose increase in the proportion\r\nthat would be necessary to establish a complete military situation,\r\nthey know to be impossible; by the published exemption from the cédula\r\n[206] and other tributes; by the supposed immunity of amulets, called\r\nanting-anting; by the illusion that none but Indians will hold office,\r\nand that the alcaldes and generals will be from their ranks; by the\r\nremembrance that money and confidence were given to the rebels of\r\nCavité, Bulacan, and other points; by the news that their partisans\r\nwere sending them from Madrid and Hong-kong; by the example of goodly\r\nnumbers of peninsulars, who are not on their guard against showing\r\ntheir hostility to the religious, in order by that manner to procure\r\nthe latter's disregard by their parishioners, who even dare to lay\r\nhands on them; and by innumerable other methods, too many, in short,\r\nto enumerate, but terribly destructive, and of maddening and vigorous\r\ninfluence in these Malayan villages.\r\n\r\nThe thought of what consist the secrets of the revolution, which the\r\nlearned gentleman, appointed as arbitrator [207] by the so-called\r\ngovernment of the insurgents to arrange with the superior authority\r\nof the islands as to the conditions of submission and the surrender of\r\narms, swore to keep secret, as appears from the justificative document\r\nof his authorization, is also terrifying. We are ignorant of what those\r\nsecrets may be, which apparently are not the politico-ecclesiastical\r\nreforms which are now demanded in Madrid, since those matters are\r\nmentioned openly in the abovesaid document signed by Aguinaldo in\r\nthe name of the rebel assembly; and the most courageous heart is\r\nterrified at the fancy that there might be an organization more\r\npowerful, more far-reaching, more general and active of revolution,\r\nsomewhat like the Katipunan, which we now see to be rapidly spreading,\r\nand which at a moment's notice, would effect a general rising, whose\r\nmost saddening results one can easily foresee, and avoid with the\r\ngreatest difficulty, unless every labor association be effectually\r\nprosecuted and extirpated in time.\r\n\r\nRemedy for that situation. Laying aside for the meanwhile those\r\ndangers, which are daily obscuring the Filipino horizon more deeply,\r\nand supposing, as we desire, that peace may be obtained throughout\r\nthe islands, the situation of the archipelago has a remedy, and\r\none, as is clear, that consists in removing all the causes that\r\nhave produced so deep a confusion and in prudently and with justice\r\nadopting the measures that, assuring peace, will protect and encourage\r\nthe legitimate interests of these inhabitants. The great mass of the\r\ncountry is not corrupted. It suffers from an access of hallucination\r\nand fanaticism produced by sectarian preachings and practices, but\r\nits heart and head are not perverted. If it be attended with care,\r\nit will return to its former pacific habits and submission. The\r\nwealthy and intelligent classes, still healthy, protest against all\r\nthose movements, and since they are loyal and friendly to us, desire\r\nthe normal mean to be reestablished as soon as possible, and will\r\ncontribute, together with the institutions of the mother-country,\r\nto the most glorious undertaking of restoring order and the pacific\r\nand progressive trend of the archipelago.\r\n\r\nIt pertains to the government to direct and manage those forces\r\nin order to obtain so satisfactory an end, by reestablishing the\r\nmainsprings of government, now so nearly disappeared or very much\r\nweakened; by giving prestige to all the conservative elements;\r\nand with an administration, grave, intelligent, active, stable,\r\nmoral, acquainted with, and fond of the country, and one dissociated\r\nwith every political doctrine, to continue and perfect the just\r\nand benevolent, and Catholic and Spanish regimen: whereby the\r\nmother-country would gain the sympathies of these inhabitants and\r\nestablish its dominion securely.\r\n\r\nThis is strange material for the peculiar objects and character\r\nof this exposition, which has no other purpose than to defend the\r\nhonor of the religious institutes and demonstrate the necessity of\r\nsupporting and invigorating their ministry, if they are to continue\r\ntheir noble and patriotic mission in the archipelago. We do not\r\nintend to mix in politics, however much we may have as much or more\r\nright than any society or individual to speak of these things. But\r\nindeed we must be the defenders of the rights of the Church, and of\r\nthe regular clergy. We are indeed under obligations to watch over\r\nSpanish interests, which are not at variance with, but perfectly\r\namalgamated with religious interests.\r\n\r\nWhat the orders need and claim. As religious then, and as Spaniards,\r\nwe address the government, and without circumlocutions or subterfuge\r\n(for these are not the times for paraphrases and euphemisms which\r\ncloak the truth), we believe that we can tell the government that if\r\nthe interests of Spanish domination in the archipelago have incurred\r\nand are incurring so serious danger of shipwreck, it is because they\r\nhave rather been, and are, profoundly combative of the interests of\r\nreligion; and that if the revolutionists have succeeded in making\r\nthemselves heard by a multitude of natives, it is because they have\r\nbeen taught, before and during the ingrate rebellion, to despise and\r\neven to persecute the religious who taught them a doctrine of peace\r\nand obedience. He who does not see this, suffers great blindness,\r\nor it is an obvious sign that he is infected with the terrible evil\r\nthat has brought so dire consequences to Filipinas. He who closes his\r\nears to the lessons of Providence--sorrowful, but indeed healthful\r\nlessons--and believes that it is possible to restore order here and\r\nestablish a prosperous and tranquil progress without strengthening\r\nreligious influences, is not far from the separatist camp, or shows\r\nthat he is unable to learn from great social catastrophes.\r\n\r\nIt is not sufficient for that purpose to recognize the need of morality\r\nand of religion. One must recognize them in all their integrity and\r\npurity, such as our holy Mother, the Church, makes them known. It is\r\nnot sufficient to talk to the people of the great doctrines of the\r\nCrucified, and instruct them not to attempt to attack the legitimate\r\ninterests of Catholicism--vagaries that so very often cover mischievous\r\nand pharisaical intentions, in order afterward, under pretext of\r\nabuses, to tell them by word and deed, not to listen to the priests\r\nwho preach those doctrines to them and inculcate in them respect\r\nfor those interests. If one would attempt to effectively establish\r\nthe peace of the archipelago upon a firm base, he must support in\r\ntoto and in solido the mission of the religious corporations, so that\r\nthey may be fruitful in the proportion that these inhabitants demand,\r\nwho are still affectionate to the faith and to civilization, and so\r\nthat the natives may be strengthened in the solid conviction that\r\nthey are obliged to obey and respect España, their true fatherland in\r\nthe social and civic order, by bonds of conscience and not by human\r\nconsiderations which are always unstable and shifting.\r\n\r\nConsequently, we regulars who have more than sufficient reasons to\r\nrecognize to their full extent the evils that affect the archipelago,\r\nso beloved by us, and who have been for some time experiencing the fact\r\nthat, far from religious action being strengthened, it is restricted\r\nand opposed in various ways, do not waver in telling the government\r\nwith blunt frankness that, if it do not consent to give that support,\r\ndaily more necessary, to the Church, the social disturbance of the\r\ncountry will continue to increase daily, and that by not applying\r\nany remedy to that evil, the stay here of the religious is becoming\r\nmorally impossible.\r\n\r\nOf what use is it for us to force ourselves to fulfil our\r\nreligio-patriotic duties, if others take it upon themselves to destroy\r\nthat labor on the instant; if they, by methods that flatter evil\r\npassions so greatly, gain the favor of the same people whom we have\r\ntaught to be docile and submissive, by saying to them continually that\r\nthey should pay no attention to us? Would it suffice, peradventure,\r\nto preach respect to property, if, at the same time, there were no\r\nlaws that protected it and public force that effectively restrained\r\nthose covetous of another? Would any professor be assured of the\r\neffects of his teaching, whose pupils were to be told by respectable\r\npersons or through vexatious methods, as they left the lecture room,\r\nto forget or despise the lessons of their masters? Then in like case\r\ndo we find ourselves in Filipinas.\r\n\r\nWe do not want, your Excellency, temporal honors or dignities, which\r\nwe have renounced by choosing for our profession a life hidden in\r\nJesus Christ. We do not belong to those who, in whatever they do,\r\nthink immediately, even when deserving them, of recompenses and\r\ndecorations. We do not desire, as our enemies believe (who judge us,\r\nperhaps, from themselves), to preponderate in the civil government\r\nand administration of the villages, nor even at least to continue our\r\nslight official intervention assigned to us in certain secular matters\r\nby law and tradition. If one desires to strip the parish priest or\r\nthe missionary of all administrative, gubernatorial, and economic\r\nfunctions, in which, without us ever claiming it, yea, ever, the\r\nsecular authority has come to solicit our modest cooperation, let it\r\nbe done at a seasonable time. Those who adopt such an inclination will\r\nsee what is most advisable for the exalted interests of the fatherland;\r\nbut from them and not from us, who have ever (even enduring because\r\nof that intervention, annoyances, censures, and persecutions, and\r\nconsidering it a true burden) been docile auxiliaries of the civil\r\nauthority, will be demanded the responsibility of the consequences\r\nthat may be occasioned by so far-reaching a measure.\r\n\r\nWe have come to the islands to preach and to preserve the Christian\r\nfaith, and to instruct these natives with the celestial food of the\r\nsacraments and the maxims of the gospel; to prove that the principal\r\nintent of España, on incorporating this territory with its crown,\r\nwas to christianize and civilize the natives. We have not come to\r\nbecome alcaldes, governors, judges, military men, agriculturists,\r\ntradesmen, or merchants; although the concord and fast union that\r\nshould prevail between the Church and State be granted, and the fact\r\nthat we constitute here the only social Spanish institution, never\r\nhave we refused to contribute with our might as good patriots and\r\nsubmissive vassals to whatever has been demanded of us, and which\r\nwe have been able to perform, without dishonor to our priestly and\r\nreligious character.\r\n\r\nWhat they as Catholic institutions contradict. All who have written\r\nupon Filipinas consider the benefit that the country, and very chiefly\r\nthe Spanish dominion, has obtained, from that system in which the\r\nparish priest and the missionary were the intermediary, more or\r\nless direct, between the public authorities and the mass of the\r\nFilipino population. It does not belong to us to demonstrate that,\r\nfor well does the history of this archipelago show it, and it is\r\nbeing told in eloquent, although tragic voices by the present fact,\r\nwith the deplorable consequences that España is feeling, and to which\r\nit has been guided by a senseless and suicidal propaganda against\r\nthe religious orders. What we have to say at present is, that if the\r\ncivil authority be not most diligently attentive to the maintenance,\r\nencouragement, and guaranty of religion and morality in the islands,\r\nas it must be through its solemn promise contracted before the supreme\r\npontiffs and before Christian Europe, in accordance with the teachings\r\nand precepts of our most holy Mother, the Church; if it do not oppose\r\na strong wall to the avalanche of insults, taunts, and systematic\r\nopposition to the religious of Filipinas, which is coming down upon\r\nthe peninsula and the archipelago; if it do not prosecute the secret\r\nsocieties with the firmness of a foreseeing government; if it do\r\nnot cause us to be respected and held as our quality as priests and\r\nSpanish corporations demand, in public and in private, in all the\r\nspheres of the social order, in whatever concerns España and its\r\nagents, repelling every project that in one way or another attempts\r\nto remove our prestige and to lessen our reputation, hindering the\r\nfruit of our labors: there is no suitable and meritorious way--and we\r\nsay it with profoundest grief--in which we can continue in the islands.\r\n\r\nWe cannot be less, your Excellency, in our order, than military men,\r\nto whom their profession is an honor and exaltation, as well as an\r\nexaction; less than the class of administrative functionaries whose\r\nrights and prerogatives are defended and guaranteed by the State; less\r\nthan the mercantile and industrial companies and undertakings, who are\r\nconsidered and protected as impelling elements of public wealth; less\r\nthan legal, medicinal, and other professional--scientific, artistic,\r\nor mechanical--associations, which are honored and respected in every\r\nwell-organized society. We believe, and this belief is not at all\r\nexaggerated, that, as Catholic institutions, we have a right to all\r\nthe honors, exemptions, and privileges, that the Christian Church and\r\nState, and the laws--in accordance with which the religious orders\r\nwere established in Filipinas--extend to ecclesiastical persons and\r\ncorporations, and especially to the regulars; and that as Spanish\r\ninstitutions, we ought to have the same consideration as the other\r\nentities that have arisen and exist under the protection of the flag\r\nof the fatherland.\r\n\r\nAs Catholic institutions, we must, with all the energy of our soul,\r\nrepel, as contrary to the imprescriptible and supreme laws of the\r\ntrue and the good, and to the original laws of the Church, freedom of\r\nworship, and the other fatal and false liberties that are the offspring\r\nof the thought, of the press, and of association, which certain men\r\nare trying to bring to this archipelago, and which conflict with the\r\nmost rudimentary duties of the patronage that España exercises here,\r\nas is clearly set forth in various places in the Recopilación de\r\nIndias. In like manner do we repel, inasmuch as it contradicts the\r\nrights of the Church, the pretended secularization of education, in\r\naccordance with what we are taught in propositions 45, 47, and 48,\r\n[208] of the Syllabus, and which are obligatory on all Catholics,\r\nand very especially on Christian princes and governments. Contrary\r\nto those rights, and entirely abusive and tyrannical, would be every\r\nmeasure that the secular power might try to adopt in regard to the\r\nreligious orders of the archipelago: whether in meddling with their\r\nregular regimen and discipline; whether in secularizing them; whether\r\nin disentailing their property, or fettering their free disposition\r\nof the same; whether in freeing their members from their obedience;\r\nwhether in depriving them of the honors or privileges which they\r\npossess according to the canons, the laws of the Indias, and Christian\r\ncommon law, as is expressed in proposition 53 of the above-mentioned\r\nSyllabus. [209] Every law that attempts to suppress, diminish, or\r\nweaken the sacred laws of personal, royal, or local ecclesiastical\r\nimmunity is contrary to the sacred rules of the Church. Also contrary\r\nto the Church, and smacking of the heresies of Wickliffe and Luther,\r\nis every ordinance that denies the clergy the right to the stipends\r\nand fees that are due them from their holy ministry, and that\r\ntries to meddle with matters of parochial fees, a thing that is\r\npeculiar to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction. It is contrary to the\r\nhonor and sanctity of the religious estate to suppose it incapable\r\nof exercising the care of souls, and to say that, in governing the\r\nparishes, we violated the canons, when in exact accordance with them,\r\nwe christianized this country, and since have continued to minister\r\nit. It is vexatious to the regular clergy, and opposed to the rights\r\nlegitimately acquired, for the civil authority to attempt to despoil\r\nthe religious corporations of the ministries and missions founded and\r\nruled by them, under the protection of the Leyes de Indias and the\r\nsovereign ordinances of the apostolic see. Incompatible with the vow\r\nof obedience that binds every religious, is the complete subjection\r\nof the individuals of the regular clergy who discharge the care of\r\nsouls to the authority of the diocesan, depriving his prelate of\r\nthe attributes that he possesses over his subjects; and the bishop\r\ncannot be allowed, to the loss or detriment of the rights of the\r\nregular superior to suppress the regular curacies at his pleasure,\r\nsince the ministries depend immediately on the corporation which\r\nappoints those religious who are to fulfil the duties of them.\r\n\r\nThe need of keeping intact the authority of the regular prelate over\r\nhis curas and missionaries. No one is ignorant that the religious\r\ncorporations of the archipelago are communities composed in their vast\r\nmajority of parish priests and missionaries. If that be so, and it must\r\nbe so, in order that the orders fulfil the peculiar end for which they\r\ncame to Filipinas, how could the jurisdiction of the regular prelate\r\nhe maintained, if the attributes that he has received from the holy\r\nsee, the only immediate authority to which the regulars are subject,\r\nfor the government of his subjects, of whatever class they be, be\r\nlessened? By pontifical laws, the religious assigned to the doctrinas\r\nand missions are considered absolutely as viventes intra claustra,\r\nwhich signifies that they are governed by their peculiar superiors,\r\nrights, and attributes, which are binding on every subject strictly\r\nconventual. If it were not so, the individual life would be established\r\nto a greater or less extent in the orders; their communal bonds would\r\ndisappear; the regular prelates would become mere figureheads; and the\r\nreligious corporations, losing the internal discipline that gives them\r\nso much vigor and strength, would be converted into associations of\r\npriests [presbiteros], who although they pronounced religious vows one\r\nday, would afterwards have no other bonds with their superiors than\r\nthe corporative habit and name, and too, perchance, the possession\r\nof the open door in order to take refuge in the convent whence they\r\nwent out, whenever they so desired or the bishop ordered it.\r\n\r\nThe action of the regular prelate over the curas and missionaries of\r\nhis order must be so active, immediate, energetic, and universal,\r\nthat he can change, remove, or transfer them, or give them another\r\noccupation and appointment, and his authority over them must remain in\r\neverything as powerful as if it were a question of the last one of the\r\nconventual religious. That is required by the regular discipline; that\r\nis demanded by the vow of obedience. In proportion as the attempt is\r\nmade with the individual to restrict or weaken the jurisdiction of the\r\norder, it is equivalent to jesting at the intention of us religious,\r\nwho do not profess to be subjects of the bishop, but only to occupy\r\nourselves in the business of religion which our prelates assign us;\r\nit is equivalent to disnaturalizing the religious corporations, and\r\nconsequently, to destroying them, the very thing that the separatists\r\nare attempting.\r\n\r\nSuch a thing will not happen, we are sure; for the moment that a law\r\nfreeing the parish priests and missionaries from subordination to their\r\nprelate, or lessening or restricting the latter's power, is dictated,\r\nno religious, by bonds of conscience, would dare to continue at the\r\nhead of his parish or mission, and all would retire to their convents\r\nat Manila. Such a thing will not happen, for the bishops themselves\r\nwould be energetically opposed to it, and would confess, as they\r\ndo, that precisely because the vast majority of their parish clergy\r\nare regulars, their clergy live so morally and apply themselves so\r\nassiduously to their ministry, and that scarcely would they find that\r\nin secular priests [presbiteros] or in regulars not fully subject to\r\ntheir order, and that they are consequently interested, through love\r\nof their flock, in having the parish ministries of the archipelago\r\ncontinue to be ruled by the same laws as hitherto. And such a thing\r\nwill not happen, we say, because the holy see, jealous guardian of\r\nthe interests of Christianity in the islands, not less than of the\r\nprestige of the regulars, will not permit it; while, at the last,\r\nthe government would be placed in the dilemma, namely, that either\r\na suitable and sufficient personnel be proposed to it, which might\r\nreplace the religious corporations of Filipinas in a stable and worthy\r\nmanner, or, on the contrary, that the latter continue discharging\r\ntheir actual duties, without the least diminution of the jurisdiction\r\nof their respective regular prelates.\r\n\r\nEspaña's obligation to send ministers of the Catholic religion to these\r\nislands and to solidly guaranty that religion. Such a thing will not\r\nhappen finally, for the government of the country can never forget\r\n(regarding this point and the others with which the present exposition\r\nis concerned) the will of Isabel the Catholic, the fundamental and\r\ncapital law of these dominions, by which the government is obliged\r\nto send here prelates and religious and other learned and austere\r\npersons of God, in order to instruct their inhabitants in the Catholic\r\nfaith, and to instruct and teach them good morals; for nothing must\r\nbe desired ahead of the publication and extension of the evangelical\r\nlaw, and the conversion and conservation of the Indians in the holy\r\nCatholic faith. \"Inasmuch as we are directing our thought and care\r\nto this as our chief aim, we order, and to the extent we may, charge\r\nthe members of our Council of Indias that laying aside every other\r\nconsideration of our profit and interest, they hold especially in\r\nmind the matters of the conversion and instruction, and above all\r\nthat they be watchful and occupy themselves with all their might and\r\nunderstanding in providing and appointing ministers sufficient for it,\r\nand take all the other measures necessary so that the Indians and\r\nnatives may be converted and conserved in the knowledge of God our\r\nLord, the honor and praise of his holy name, so that, we fulfilling\r\nthis duty which so tightly binds us and which we so desire to satisfy,\r\nthe members of the said Council may discharge their consciences,\r\nsince we have discharged ours with them.\" (Law i, tít. i, book ii\r\nand law viii, tít. ii, book ii of Recopilación de Indias.)\r\n\r\nThe Council of Ministers together with the ministry of the colonies\r\n[210] has been substituted for the Council of Indias, of whose devotion\r\nand zeal in fulfilling the fundamental duties of their trust, we\r\ncannot harbor the least doubt.\r\n\r\nVery expressive also to the question in hand is law lxv, tít. xiv,\r\nbook i of the same Recopilación. \"We order the viceroys, presidents,\r\nauditors, governors, and other justices of the Indias, to give all\r\nthe protection necessary for that service to the religious of the\r\norders resident in those provinces and occupied in the conversion\r\nand instruction of the natives, to our entire satisfaction, by which\r\nGod has been, and is, served, and the natives much benefited, and to\r\nhonor them greatly, and encourage them to continue, and do the same,\r\nand more, if possible, as we expect from their persons and goodness.\"\r\n\r\nWords of the instructions to Legaspi; of the laws of Partìdas;\r\n[211] of Felipe II. Thus was it commanded scores of times to the\r\nauthorities of these islands, and in harmony with that legislation,\r\nin the instructions to the great Legaspi, it is expressly stated:\r\n\r\n\"You shall have special care in all the negotiations that you shall\r\nhave with the natives of those districts to have with you some of\r\nthe religious, both in order to make use of their good counsel,\r\nand so that the natives may recognize and understand the great\r\nconsideration in which you hold them; for seeing that and the great\r\nreverence given them by the soldiers, they will also come to respect\r\nthem. That will be very important, so that, when the religious impart\r\nto them the matters pertaining to our holy Catholic faith, they may\r\ngive them full credit; since you know that his Majesty's chiefest end\r\nis the salvation of the souls of those infidels. For that purpose,\r\nin whatever district, you shall take particular care to aid the said\r\nreligious ... so that, having learned the language, they may labor\r\nto bring the natives to the knowledge of our holy Catholic faith,\r\nconvert them to it, and reduce them to the obedience and friendship\r\nof his Majesty.\" (Colec. de Doc. Inéd. de Ultramar, ii, p. 188.) [212]\r\n\r\nThat is the genuinely Spanish spirit, the glory of the human race,\r\nand especially of Christianity, which caused our legislators to write\r\nin the Partidas (Partida i, tít. vi, law lxii, and tít. xi): \"Laymen\r\nmust honor and regard the clergy greatly, each one according to his\r\nrank and his dignity: firstly, because they are mediators between God\r\nand them; secondly, because by honoring them, they honor Holy Church,\r\nwhose servants they are, and honor the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ,\r\nwho is their head, for they are called Christians. And this honor\r\nand this regard must be shown in three ways; in speech; in deed;\r\nand in counsel.\" \"The churches of the emperors, kings, and other\r\nseigniors of the countries, have great privileges and liberties;\r\nand these were very rightfully [given them], for the things of God\r\nshould have greater honor than those of men.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the spirit that was expressed by the mouth of Felipe II when\r\nhe answered those who proposed to him the abandonment of these islands,\r\nin consideration of the few resources that the public treasury derived\r\nfrom them: \"For the conversion of only one soul of those there,\r\nI would give all the treasures of the Indias, and were they not\r\nsufficient I would give most willingly whatever España yields. Under\r\nno consideration shall I abandon or discontinue to send preachers and\r\nministers to give the light of the holy gospel to all and whatever\r\nprovinces may be discovered, however poor, rude, and barren they may\r\nbe, for the holy apostolic see has given to us and to our heirs the\r\nduty possessed by the apostles of publishing and preaching the gospel,\r\nwhich must be spread there and into an infinite number of kingdoms,\r\ntaking them from the power of devils and giving them to know the true\r\nGod, without any hope of temporal blessings.\"\r\n\r\nDuties of the government and of others in regard to religious\r\ninterests in the islands. Consequently, those offenses that should\r\nbe most prosecuted in Filipinas, and against which the government\r\nshould prove especially active, are offenses against religion and\r\nagainst ecclesiastical persons, as such offenses are those which\r\nwound the greatest social welfare, and are most directly opposed to\r\nthe fundamental obligation that España contracted on incorporating\r\nthese islands with its crown. Hence, masonry, an anti-Catholic and\r\nanti-national society, ought not to be permitted, but punished\r\nseverely; every propaganda against the dogmas, precepts, and\r\ninstitutions of our holy Mother, the Church, ought to be proscribed;\r\noutrages against the clergy and religious ought to be punished with\r\ngreater rigor than when committed against any other class of persons,\r\ngiving such outrages the character of sacrilege, which they positively\r\npossess; all, from the governor-general to the lowest dependent of\r\nthe State, ought to exert themselves to demonstrate by their word\r\nand example, in public and in private, and without those conventional\r\nexteriorities of pure social form (a Catholicism that becomes naught\r\nbut mere observance and courtesy, and which, unfortunately, abounds\r\nso widely), that they love and respect the Catholic religion, and\r\nthat they esteem more the duties toward God and toward His holy\r\nChurch that proceed from it, than any other duty and obligation,\r\nhowever exalted and respectable may be the institution that imposes it.\r\n\r\nHence the government of the nation and exalted authorities must be\r\nthe first who ought to destroy, not only in their official, but in\r\ntheir private acts, and as politicians, authors, government employees,\r\nmilitary men, in the different orders of social life, the ridiculous\r\nand contemptuous idea that free thought has sown against priests\r\nand religious, permitting themselves to talk of them in a tone that\r\nhonors the clergy so little, and which when known by the elements of\r\nother inferior social classes, cause respect to the Catholic priest to\r\nbecome weakened daily, many judging that the religion of officials is\r\nfrequently nothing more than a social hypocrisy and a practice of pure\r\npolitical convenience. Hence the government ought to very carefully\r\nsee that all its personnel in the archipelago be sincere and earnest\r\nCatholics, in order that the sad spectacle may not be again seen,\r\nthat we have so often and so prodigally witnessed, by which the chief\r\nones, in opposing the apostolic labor of the religious corporations,\r\nare the very ones, who, inasmuch as they are functionaries of a\r\nCatholic state, ought to be those who support and strengthen it the\r\nmost. Hence every association, assembly, or undertaking which is\r\ntrying to sow here anti-religious or anti-clerical ideas, under any\r\ncolor or pretext, even the exercise of political rights, ought to be\r\nprevented at all hazards from having any representation or branch in\r\nthese islands; and the previous censorship over every kind of book,\r\npamphlet, and engraving that comes from outside, and over those\r\nwhich shall be published here, should be restored, or better said,\r\nstrengthened. Hence, the close union of all the peninsular element\r\nhere resident becomes more necessary, so that, all united for the\r\nprotection of our divine religion, by all respected and obeyed,\r\nwe may resist the enemies of the fatherland with greater force; may\r\nnot by our discords give the rebel camp opportunity to gain strength;\r\nand as far as possible, may succeed in elevating the moral prestige,\r\ntoday, unfortunately fallen so low. Hence, likewise, is the great\r\nnecessity of the disappearance in gubernatorial circles of an erroneous\r\nidea, most fatal and extremely disrespectful to the orders, which,\r\npropagated by sectarian spirits or by bad or lukewarm Catholics,\r\nseems now to be a postulate of many politicians in Madrid, and of\r\nthe majority of peninsulars who come to this archipelago.\r\n\r\nInfamous idea in regard to the importance of the orders and the manner\r\nin which they are generally regarded. We refer to the idea which began\r\nto spread after the revolution of '68, which looks upon the religious\r\nof Filipinas as an evil necessity, as an archaic institution, with\r\nwhich differences must be composed for reasons of state; as a purely\r\npolitical resource, and a convenience to the nation, which cannot\r\nbe substituted with others. That infamous idea, manifested at times\r\nfrankly, and at times with reticence or with insinuations that cut more\r\ndeeply than a knife, is known by our declared enemies. It is known\r\nby the natives of the country who have been in the Peninsula. It is\r\nknown, because it has been propagated in newspapers and other products\r\nof the press that have penetrated the archipelago, by a vast number\r\nof natives, who, with having left Filipinas, are notably offended by\r\nit. All the peninsulars who make war on us, whether by anti-religious\r\nprejudices, by doctrinal compromise, by personal resentment, by\r\nflippancy, or by envy (for among all those classes do we have enemies)\r\nhelp to spread and propagate that idea throughout the islands.\r\n\r\nFrom that idea many deduce the opinion that we are dragging out in\r\nthis country an existence of pure compassion and condescension;\r\nthat we are living here, tolerated and as if on alms, instead of\r\nhonored and respected as any other institution of the mother-country;\r\nthat in many ways, one would believe that we religious are less and\r\nhave less value than the military, than the government employes, or\r\nthan those of other professions and careers; and that with wonderful\r\nfacility one imputes to us, as to the most abandoned and destitute,\r\nthe blame for all the evils that afflict the country, governors\r\nand other representatives of the government and administration\r\nof the islands availing themselves of our name of obliged appeal,\r\nin order to evade and shun responsibilities, whenever any calamity\r\ncomes upon them or whenever there is any unpleasant event to bewail\r\nin their conduct. For all, there is indulgence, for all, excuse, for\r\nall kindness and the eyes of charity. The epoch is one of adjustment\r\nand respect for all manner of extensions, although with the loss of\r\nmorality and justice. Only in what concerns priests and religious\r\nmust one look with contemptuous pride, with extreme rigor, and with\r\ndespotic exaction. The religious has to pay it all; on him must all\r\nthe blame be cast; to him belong the feelings of anger, the aversions,\r\nthe censures, the expressions of contempt. We appear, your Excellency,\r\nto be only the anima vilis [213] of the archipelago.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that we, as the priestly and religious class, and as a\r\nSpanish corporation, cannot in any manner consent to this humiliating\r\nposition, which, as private persons, obliged to greater perfection\r\nthan the generality of Christians, we endure patiently, remembering\r\nthe words of the apostle \"tamquam purgamenta hujus mundi facti sumus\r\nomnium peripsema usque adhuc,\" [214] and of which we would not speak\r\nif the evil were restricted to one of so many annoyances annexed\r\nto our ministry; so much the more as we unfortunately see that that\r\ninjurious and erroneous idea is greatly injuring our ministry, and is\r\ndaily causing our influence among the people who are entrusted to us\r\nto become lessened, since they are assailed strongly and tenaciously\r\nby all the disturbing agents that have caused the insurrection.\r\n\r\nRespect that they merit as religious and as Spaniards. The religious\r\ncorporations ought to be greatly honored and distinguished (and it\r\ngrieves us deeply, your Excellency, to have to speak of these things):\r\nfirstly, because their individual members are adorned with the priestly\r\ncharacter, which is the greatest honor and dignity among Christians\r\nthat men can have; secondly, because their apostolic mission has\r\nhere propagated and preserves the splendors of Catholicism. They\r\nare priests and they are religious: thus they unite the two devices\r\nthat inspire the greatest veneration among any society, which feels\r\nsome needs superior to the material, or those of their proud reason\r\ndivorced from Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\nNot less respect do they merit in their character as Spanish\r\nentities. Besides being here ministers of the official religion, they\r\nare public ecclesiastical persons, recognized by the state. They live\r\nunder its safeguard, as do the military and civil entities. They have\r\nlabored, and are laboring, for the fatherland, at least as much as any\r\nother class of Spaniards residing in the archipelago. And in the point\r\nof intelligence, within their respective profession and of morality\r\nand private and civic virtues, they rise not only collectively, but\r\nindividually, to so great a height as the class that is considered\r\nthe most high and reputable in the archipelago.\r\n\r\nThere is one most special reason and one of extraordinary importance\r\nwhich demands that that respect should be sanctioned by the laws and\r\nsupported by customs, namely, that the religious in his respective\r\nduties, becomes, as a general rule, the only peninsular, and,\r\ntherefore, the only representative of the mother-country in the\r\nmajority of the Filipino villages. Consequently, Spanish prestige is\r\ngreatly interested in that he be the object of such considerations and\r\nguaranties that these inhabitants far from seeing, as unfortunately\r\nthey have not a few times seen, that he is despised and humbled,\r\nbe daily more fortified in the traditional idea that their cura or\r\nmissionary is, at once the minister of God and the representative\r\nof España, a lofty idea that has redounded, and redounds, so greatly\r\nto the favor of the mother-country, and says so much in honor of all\r\nthe Spanish entities.\r\n\r\nWe came to the archipelago through our love to religion and España,\r\nand have remained in it more than three centuries, ready to continue\r\nhere so long as conscience does not dictate the contrary to us. Gross\r\ntemporal considerations do not move us, nor sentiments of pride and\r\nof mere personal dignity. In the fulfilment of our duties, we have\r\nstriven to attain even sacrifice and by the grace of God, we shall\r\ncontinue the sacrifice. A good proof of this is offered the impartial\r\ncritic by the present epoch of rebellions and insurrections. The\r\ncura and missionaries, in spite of persuasions that they were putting\r\ntheir lives in great danger by the continual plots of the ferocious\r\nKatipunan, have steadfastly maintained themselves in their posts,\r\nforeseeing that if they abandoned their parishioners, a general rising\r\nof the islands was almost certain. This procedure, if not heroic, is\r\nsufficiently near it, and has cost us many victims, snatching away our\r\ndearest brethren from us, some treacherously assassinated and others\r\nimmolated by reckless mobs seduced by filibusters and masons. And\r\nalthough this sad sacrifice has seemingly not been bewailed and\r\nappreciated, as perhaps it ought to be by the loyal sons of España,\r\nwe trust that God, the compassionate and generous remunerator of every\r\ngood deed, will in His infinite mercy, receive it as a propitiation\r\nfor the evils of this unfortunate country, and will have rewarded\r\nthe martyrs of religion and of the fatherland.\r\n\r\nCharacter and objects of this exposition. May the nation, government,\r\nand your Excellency, pardon this slight extension of our sentiments of\r\ndignity, offended as religious and as Spaniards. This is not a memorial\r\nof merits and services, since we have never solicited applause or\r\nrecompense, which never constitute the lever of our labors. Neither is\r\nit a panegyric, which we are not called upon to make, and which we do\r\nnot believe is wanting, since the history of the religious corporations\r\nof Filipinas detaches itself so patiently and cleanly in all kinds\r\nof just and upright progress. It contains some apologetic matter and\r\nmuch of most sensible complaint because of the unjustifiable injuries\r\nthat almost daily are received by us. It is the weak expression of the\r\nprofound bitterness that seizes upon us at contemplating and viewing\r\nfrom anear the condition of vast disturbance in which this beautiful\r\nportion of the fatherland finds itself. With the utmost respect and\r\nsubmission, laying aside absolutely whatever proceeds from political\r\nparties and much more from private persons, it tells the government\r\nwith Christian simplicity and synthetically that it should adopt and\r\nmaintain a perfectly logical criterion with regard to the religious\r\ncorporations of Filipinas; and that, therefore, if it thinks, as is\r\njust and decorous, that we, the religious corporations, exercise a\r\nmost lofty and necessary mission in the archipelago, honorable and\r\nworthy of the greatest consideration, of its own accord and without\r\nutilitarian considerations and false reasons of state, it so manifest\r\nclearly and with nobility, making a beginning by giving a practical\r\nexample of that in its laws and decrees, and in its instructions to the\r\nauthorities of these islands, and that it do not allow us to be annoyed\r\nor insulted; and so much the more since being weak and helpless,\r\nand bound as we are by religious weakness and patience, we have no\r\nother means of defense than our right and the protection of the good,\r\nand we can never appeal to the means of repression and influence to\r\nwhich we allude in the beginning of this expository statement.\r\n\r\nBut if the government, on the contrary, by an error that we would\r\nrespect, not without qualifying it, in our humble judgment, as most\r\nfatal to the interests of religion and the fatherland, should believe\r\nthat the religious have terminated their traditional mission here,\r\nlet it also have the frankness to say so. We shall listen to its\r\nresolution calmly. But let it not imagine, in adopting measures which,\r\nattaching, although without claiming it, the privileges of the Church,\r\nour profession as priests and regulars, and our honor as refined\r\nSpaniards, that in practice it might appear that it was trying to\r\nburn one candle to Christ and another to Belial, that it was trying\r\nto please masons and Catholics, good patriots and separatists, by\r\nplacing the orders in a so graceless situation that they might become\r\nlike the mouthful that was thrown into the jaws of the wild beast in\r\norder to silence its roars for the time being.\r\n\r\nSynthesis of the same. Such would happen if the secularization\r\nof the regular ministries; the secularization of education; the\r\ndisamortization of the property of the corporations, or the expression\r\nof the liberty that belongs to them to enjoy and dispose of them;\r\nthe declaration of the tolerance of worship; the establishment of\r\ncivil marriage; the permission of every kind of association; and\r\nthe liberty of the press became law. Such would happen, in what more\r\ndirectly concerns us, if the government continuing here and there its\r\ncampaign against us, unjustifiable from every point of view, were to\r\nshow by its acts that it actually conceives that we have been the cause\r\nof the insurrection, and that we are opposed to the progress of these\r\nislands, and to the unfolding of their legitimate aspirations. Such\r\nwould happen, if the government, failing to rigorously prosecute\r\nsecret societies, and to effectively correct the seditious ones who\r\nare exciting the ignorant masses of the people against the regulars\r\nand against all that is most holy and Spanish in the islands, should\r\ndesire the religious to continue in their ministries, liable at any\r\nmoment to be sacrificed, as is the terrible watchword of the sect,\r\nand which has already unfortunately occurred, without, perhaps, their\r\nhaving even the consolation that those sacrifices are appreciated.\r\n\r\nIf we religious are to continue to be of use in the islands to religion\r\nand España, no one can have any doubt that it must be by thoroughly\r\nguarantying our persons, our prestige, and our ministry, it must be by\r\nknowing that the fatherland appreciates and treats us as its sons, and\r\nthat it must not abandon us as an object of derision to our enemies,\r\nand as victims to the rancor of masonry and separatism. Martyrdom\r\ndoes not terrify us, but only honors us, although we do not consider\r\nourselves worthy of so holy an honor: but we do not desire to die as\r\nif criminals, enveloped with the censures of friends and enemies,\r\nand perhaps, abandoned and despised by those who ought to protect\r\nand esteem us.\r\n\r\nThat is the extremely gloomy and graceless situation in which the\r\norders find themselves, especially since the beginning of the Tagárog\r\ninsurrection, and above all, since the extension of the Katipunan,\r\na situation that threatens to become worse, if the government becomes\r\nthe echo of the filibusters, of the masons, of the radical elements,\r\nwhich, it seems, have conspired together to give the finishing stroke\r\nto the great social-religious edifice, raised in these islands by\r\nCatholic España.\r\n\r\nBy that no one should be surprised that we religious, placed in so\r\nimminent a peril, desirous of not offering abstracts to the policy of\r\nany government, and of avoiding the censure that we are the cause of\r\nthe evils of the country and the bar to its progress, should choose the\r\nabandonment of our ministries, exile, and expatriation, in preference\r\nto our continuance in the islands in a situation, which, if prolonged\r\nfor a longer time, will result as decidedly dishonoring to our class,\r\nand would make our permanence in the archipelago unfruitful.\r\n\r\nWe have fulfilled our duty here as good men; such is our firm\r\nconviction. Should we go elsewhere, there, by the grace of God,\r\nwe shall also be able to fulfil our duty. And for that result, the\r\nholy see, if contrary to all our just expectations, it cannot succeed\r\nin making itself heard by the Spanish nation, will not deny us the\r\nopportune permission.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we have trust in the noble sentiments and deeply-rooted\r\nCatholicism of her Majesty, the queen regent; we trust in the devotion\r\nand patriotism of the ministers of the crown; we trust in the sensible\r\nopinion shared by the majority of the Spanish people; we trust in the\r\nintelligence and spirit of justice of the Catholic minister of the\r\ncolonies; and we trust that, after listening to the most dignified\r\nprelates of these islands, and after taking into consideration the\r\nprescriptions of natural and canonical law, the exalted advantages\r\nof the fatherland in these regions, and the undeniable services that\r\nthe religious orders in Filipinas have contributed, no resolution\r\ncontrary to the teachings and precepts of our holy Mother, the Church,\r\nwill be adopted, and which is contrary to the prestige of the regular\r\nclergy, but that, on the contrary, the Catholic institutions of this\r\narchipelago will be once more affirmed and strengthened, as is imposed\r\nby both religion and the fatherland.\r\n\r\nIn this confidence, and reiterating our traditional adhesion to the\r\nthrone, and to its institutions, we conclude, praying God for the\r\nprosperity and new progress of the monarchy, for the health of his\r\nMajesty, the king, and of her Majesty, the queen regent (whom may God\r\npreserve), and for prudence of the Cortes and the government in their\r\nresolutions, and very especially for your Excellency, whose life may\r\nGod preserve many years.

Especially\r\nhave been distinguished in this direction the Spanish monarchs, who,\r\nbesides other privileges granted in favor of the farmers, have thought\r\nit well to decree that neither the implements for their labors, nor\r\ntheir lands, should be taken from them for any civil debt; and also\r\nthey granted to these laborers the privilege that they could not be\r\nimprisoned for any civil debt in the season for their harvesting and\r\nfield labors, authorizing the superior judges to grant them delay\r\nin such cases. But besides these so useful and valuable benefits\r\nthe natives of Filipinas enjoy still others more extraordinary. For\r\ntheir security, besides having ordained that their goods shall not be\r\nseized for costs in lawsuits, nor shall they be punished with pecuniary\r\nfines, conferring upon them other favors of the same kind, it has been\r\nlikewise commanded that no one may lend money to them above the sum\r\nof five pesos, under the penalty of losing what is lent them beyond\r\nthat. In all these things the monarchs have sought to release the\r\nfarmers from many oppressions and injuries, and to prevent the losses\r\nand deficits which otherwise, for most of the vassals, are caused\r\nby caring for the interests and profits of a few individuals. But\r\nit occasions the greatest sorrow that in Filipinas, contrary to the\r\npious and Christian intention of our kings--and especially that of\r\nthe wise monarch, who is now prosperously governing us, our lord Don\r\nCarlos III (whom may God preserve)--Spaniards should have acted,\r\nin regard to these exemptions, without any heed or consideration\r\nfor the injuries which have resulted here to the Indians and their\r\nagriculture, and with notable loss of the wealth which the fertility\r\nand valuable products of this country promise.\r\n\r\nAnd since this chief executive, actuated by what he himself has\r\nobserved in this province of Pampanga, in that of Bulacan, and in\r\nthose of Tondo and Laguna de Bay (which he has visited personally),\r\ncannot any longer permit such extortions and injuries as are caused,\r\namong all classes of persons, to the farmers and poor Indians in the\r\nsaid provinces, and in the other districts to which this decree will\r\nalso be made to extend: I command that in future the implements of\r\nlabor--such as carabaos, plows, hemp-combs, and other field utensils\r\nbelonging to the Indians, mestizos, creoles, Spaniards, or any other\r\nclass of persons--shall not be seized for a civil debt, any more than\r\ntheir lands, since most of them have no ownership in these. Moreover,\r\nthey shall not be arrested at the times when they must work in the\r\nfields, such as plowing, and gathering their harvests: and, at the\r\ntimes when they can be arrested, authority shall be given to the\r\nalcaldes-mayor so that they can grant them a respite of six months,\r\nwithout loading them with fees or other exactions.\r\n\r\nAnd, as the backward state of agriculture in Filipinas proceeds\r\nalso from the fact that, notwithstanding there are many industrious,\r\nlaborious and charitable persons in the villages, there are also many\r\nothers in whom sloth and idleness reign--for instance, many chiefs and\r\ntheir sons, and the heads of barangay; and generally these who have\r\nexercised the office of magistrate (who, on account of having served\r\nin these employments, afterward refuse through a sort of vanity and\r\npride to go back to field work), all these caring only to subjugate the\r\ncommon people by compelling them to work without pay in their fields,\r\nand trying to exempt themselves from the common labor, and from the\r\nother burdens to which those who pay tribute are subject--likewise\r\nthis chief executive has resolved to declare that such exemptions\r\nought not to be understood for the classes of persons who are mentioned\r\nabove, unless they possess at least eight cabalitas of their own land\r\ncultivated and worked by their servants or day-laborers, expressly\r\nforbidding that they rent these lands to others--always provided that\r\nthey are not prevented by age or infirmities from carrying on their\r\nfarm-work in person, since in this case they are allowed to rent them.\r\n\r\nAnd although, in regard to the contract of casamajan [217] which\r\nthey commonly practice, absolute prohibition ought to be made to\r\nthem on account of the burden which ensues from it to the poor, and\r\nalso to their own consciences, on account of the many usurious acts\r\nwhich are committed therein, [yet] considering, as has been already\r\nstated, that there will be many who, on account of age and sickness,\r\ncannot themselves attend to the cultivation of their land, this chief\r\nexecutive consents to grant such persons a contract of that sort,\r\nunder the condition that whatever loan is made to the farmers by\r\ntheir partners, it shall be in the form of palay, and they shall\r\ncollect it in the same; that is, if they shall lend, for example,\r\nfour cavans [of rice], they shall receive four others. And the same is\r\nordained in regard to money, so that if they shall lend, for example,\r\ntwo pesos they shall receive only two pesos; and, if they shall lend\r\ncloth, if it is not returned they may only receive its just value at\r\nthe time when the bargain was made--under the penalty that no judge\r\nshall admit any claim in contravention of this ordinance, and the\r\ncomplainants shall lose what they had lent.\r\n\r\nBesides this, I have in the same manner heard of the unjust and vile\r\nbargains which the usurers make in regard to the cultivated lands,\r\nand even the trees which the farmers cultivate in their gardens, and\r\ntheir houses, binding them with the agreement of retrovendendi, [218]\r\nas it is commonly called, exacting from him who is bound--sometimes\r\nfor many years, and sometimes forever--the produce and the ownership\r\n[of those possessions], for a small amount which the lender has\r\nfurnished. They also exact a premium for the money which they lend,\r\nsometimes in valuables, and sometimes besides these. This is done by\r\na multitude of usurers who overrun the island, with great offense to\r\nGod and injury to their neighbors. In order to redress such evils,\r\nwhich provoke divine justice against the islands, this chief executive\r\nhas also resolved to ordain that in future such contracts shall not\r\nbe made, either by writing or in words; for they are null and void,\r\nand usurious. And we forbid all the magistrates of these islands\r\nto give hearing to any claim arising from these contracts; if they\r\ncontravene this order, they remain responsible for all losses and\r\ninjuries, with the penalty, besides, of a fine of five hundred pesos.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the inhabitants of all the islands ought to have\r\nunderstood that the lands which they obtained are all royal [realengas]\r\nor communal, with the exception of those which they possess through\r\ninheritance, or through legitimate purchase from the native chiefs\r\n[caciques] who were cultivating them at the time when the Catholic\r\nfaith was established in Filipinas, and when they rendered fidelity,\r\nobedience, and vassalage to the august Spanish monarchs; and of those\r\nwhich were purchased from his Majesty with title of ownership from\r\nthe royal Audiencia. [They should also understand] that for this\r\nreason the royal lands cannot be absolutely sold or alienated, since\r\nthey only enjoy the use and usufruct of them; consequently, those\r\nwho fail to cultivate them for the years appointed by the Audiencia\r\nlose this right of use, and the magistrates ought to assign these\r\nlands immediately to another person. As for the rest of the lands,\r\nno one can obtain them except by right of purchase and agreement\r\nwith the tribunal of indults and compositions [219] of lands, which\r\nhis Majesty has established for this purpose. In the same manner, the\r\nlands which they hold by this tenure, as those inherited, or purchased\r\nfrom native chiefs, they cannot sell without the intervention of\r\nthe court of justice. For this reason, warning is given that in the\r\nhouse-lots of the villages also they have no more than the use of the\r\nland; on this account, whenever the term of three years has passed\r\nwithout those who had formerly lived on them building houses on these\r\nlots, it has been and is the duty of the court to assign these lots\r\nto other persons--without allowing or accepting lawsuit or claim,\r\nwhen this neglect is evident, either through general report or by the\r\nverbal deposition of witnesses who have resided there a long time and\r\nare conscientious; for these house-lots are common property of the\r\nvillages in which they are located, and for this reason the ownership\r\nof them cannot be sold, because this title does not belong to those\r\nwho dwell in them. In regard to this matter, and with observation\r\nand knowledge of the injuries connected with it, this chief executive\r\n(having been actually present in this, province of Pampanga, and in\r\nthe others that have been named) likewise ordains that the house and\r\nhouse-lot cannot be seized from any debtor, of whatever class he may\r\nbe, as is commonly done--leaving in the street, and exposed to beggary\r\nand other evils, a multitude of Indians who perhaps would again be\r\nself-supporting, if they could have recourse to their own sheltering\r\nroof (which hardly would be worth as much as ten pesos), and the trees\r\nwhich they enjoyed on their own land. Proceedings must be taken only\r\nagainst their goods, without leaving them or their wives destitute;\r\nfor it is very well known (as those who lend ought to know) that no\r\none can lend to a native more than five pesos--an amount which he\r\ncan easily pay with his work, or with some article of luxury which\r\nhe may possess. This regulation must serve for the magistrates,\r\nas they are ordained and commanded, in order that they may conform\r\nto it; and, in virtue of the ordinance by his Majesty that in cases\r\ninvolving from one to five hundred pesos formal claim shall not be\r\nbrought into court, the alcaldes-mayor shall decide these verbally,\r\nwithout receiving formal complaints, or anything else except the\r\n[original] documents, or the verbal declaration or confrontation of\r\nthe parties. It must be noted that in cases where this is necessary,\r\nand the complaining party shall name some valuable article which is\r\nworth the amount of his demand, the magistrate shall proceed to sell\r\nit in the public square; and by selling it to the highest bidder,\r\nin one day (which shall be announced by the public crier), payment\r\nshall be made to the claimant, handing over the rest to the debtor,\r\nand deducting only such fees as are proper for the few hours of\r\ntime which the judge may have spent on the case. By this, however,\r\nmust be understood that in such cases their wooden houses which may\r\nhave some value (as they actually do in most of the villages) shall\r\nnot remain exempt from seizure; for it is certain that the owners of\r\nsuch houses, if through ill-luck or calamity they come to misfortune,\r\ncan never lack some means among their own relatives for establishing\r\nthemselves in some humble house, which they can erect as cheaply as\r\nI have just stated.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the repartimientos of people for the royal works,\r\nwhich are constructed in the provinces near Manila, as also in\r\nregard to the domestic servants [tanores], and other people who are\r\nassigned for work on the churches, government buildings, and jails,\r\nand guards [bantayes], etc., various regulations have been made;\r\nbut, knowing that these are not sufficient to uproot so many wrongs,\r\ninjuries and oppressions as the Indians suffer from the magistrates\r\nof their villages, and from the heads of barangay--making the villages\r\ncontribute a greater number of people than is needed and required, and\r\nexempting from their turn of service those who should render it (both\r\nof these proceedings serving to defraud the poor, who, in order not to\r\nleave their grain fields, yield whatever the magistrates and chiefs\r\nask from them, according to their caprice and the extent of their\r\ngreed)--it is ordained and commanded that both these repartimientos\r\nbe carried out with the knowledge and consent of the parish curas. To\r\neach individual cura must be sent a statement of the number of people\r\nnecessary, and of the quota from each village; and the headmen shall\r\nbe under strict obligation to obtain certificates from the said father\r\ncuras that they have carried out the repartimiento in conformity with\r\nthe decrees. It must be understood that these repartimientos cannot\r\nbe made in conscience, and without contravention of the law, among the\r\nfarmers and artisans who are occupied in their tasks, so long as there\r\nare wandering and idle people, since these last are the ones assigned\r\nby the law for these necessities. As little are the sons of the chief\r\nexempt, or the heads of barangay who have no occupation, or those who\r\nhave held an official position, if, relying on this sort of privilege,\r\nthey do not return to their former occupation or duties in the field.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is ordained and commanded to all the governors,\r\ncorregidors, alcaldes-mayor, and other magistrates throughout the\r\nisland, that they most punctually observe and fulfil whatever is here\r\ndecreed, in order thus to render greater service to God, and to the\r\nking--who has entrusted to the carefulness, conscience and vigilance\r\nof this supreme government the welfare of these islands and of all\r\ntheir inhabitants; also their social condition, just government,\r\npromotion, and reputation. And the said governors, corregidors,\r\nalcaldes-mayor and other magistrates here mentioned are warned to\r\nfulfil whatever is here decreed, under a penalty of five hundred\r\npesos fine; and on the alcaldes of the natives, the mestizos, and\r\nothers of their class a fine of twenty pesos is imposed, both fines\r\nto be applied in the usual manner. These fines shall be exacted from\r\nthem whenever any application shall be presented that is founded upon\r\nany transgression of this decree, or when its infraction shall be\r\nproved in any manner. And as it is necessary that the parish priests\r\nshall aid, on their side, and shall be zealous for its fulfilment,\r\nthe reverend and illustrious archbishops and bishops and the devout\r\nprovincials of the islands shall be urgently requested to incite\r\nand oblige their parish priests to the observance of these wholesome\r\nregulations and ordinances, charging upon their consciences that if\r\nthey know of any failure to observe the decree, they shall communicate\r\nit to the supreme government. The said reverend prelates shall also be\r\nnotified that this supreme government expects--from their well-known\r\nzeal and love for their flocks, and because they have resigned all\r\nelse for the greater service of God and of the king--that they will\r\ncoöperate by their utterances and with their effective persuasions in\r\nfulfilling by all means the desires and intentions of the governor,\r\nwho considers himself under the strictest obligation to issue this\r\nordinance, and to command that it be carried out until his Majesty\r\nshall be pleased to confirm it. Before his royal throne will be\r\npresented the merit and activity of each one of those who excel\r\nin solicitude for its observance, a full account of which will be\r\ngiven to his Majesty in our next despatches. And, in order that this\r\ndecree may be known in all the villages and in all the districts of\r\nthe island, and published with all possible fulness and clearness,\r\nit shall be translated into all the dialects; and as many copies as\r\nshall be necessary shall be printed, in two columns, the first in\r\nCastilian, and the second in the respective idiom of the province to\r\nwhich it shall be sent. Copies of these shall be posted everywhere\r\nin the magistrates' offices of the villages, and printed copies shall\r\nbe supplied to all the courts of the capital, in order that they may\r\nobserve and fulfil the decree, so far as it belongs to them.\r\n\r\nAt the village of Arayat, on the twentieth day of the month of March,\r\n1784,\r\n\r\n\r\nDon Joseph Basco y Vargas\r\n\r\n\r\nBy command of his Lordship:\r\n\r\nVizente Gonzales de Tagle, notary-public ad interim of the\r\ngovernment. [220]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL CONDITIONS IN 1866\r\n\r\n[The following article is taken from Jagor's Reisen, pp. 303-306.]\r\n\r\n\r\nExcepting some large estates acquired in earlier times through\r\ndonation, landed property originated mainly through the right of\r\noccupation by the possessor and his rendering the land productive which\r\neven now is a common right recognized in the laws of the Indias in\r\nfavor of the indigenous inhabitants. In the exercise of this right,\r\nthe native takes possession of such unused land as is necessary\r\nfor his house and tilled fields, and loses it only when it remains\r\nuncultivated for two years. Setting aside these native (and likewise\r\nvery poor) landed proprietors, landed property is legally acquired in\r\nthe following manner: through purchase from the state of a certain\r\narea of unimproved crown lands [Spanish, realengas]; through actual\r\npurchase from the natives who possess property; through contracts\r\n(called pactos de retro) concluded with the natives; and through\r\nthe pledging or hypothecation of bonds, which even these natives are\r\naccustomed to agree to, especially in commercial dealings.\r\n\r\nThe first of these means ought to be a source of wealth; but it is\r\nnot, for various reasons. At present very few persons are familiar\r\nwith the legislation regarding the unused crown land, which consists\r\nof numberless single decrees forming a casuistical, disconnected,\r\ncomplicated, and confused mass.... By a royal order of 1857, the first\r\noffer for untilled crown lands was fixed at fifty dollars a quiñon;\r\nand the concession could not be secured without a previous public\r\nauction. From that time private persons held aloof from such demands;\r\nto the former evils are added the high price, and the danger of being\r\noutbidden in the auction, and thus of losing one's trouble and expense\r\nfor the examination of the lands. In 1859 the decree was modified, and\r\nthe former price of four reals a quiñon as first offer was established;\r\nbut this decree is not yet published.\r\n\r\nIn order that capital may flow into agriculture--without which that\r\nindustry cannot possibly be developed to the production of grain\r\nand colonial products for exportation--it is absolutely necessary\r\nto overcome all obstacles which discourage men of wealth. Among\r\nthese hindrances stands in the first rank the local administration,\r\nin regard to the granting of untilled crown lands; in the second,\r\nthe obstructions which are placed in the way of both [Spanish]\r\nnatives and foreigners who wish to acquire rights of settlement and\r\ncitizenship in the community. Besides the difficulty of acquiring large\r\npossessions, still others exist. The planter can easily find laborers,\r\nto whom he must make considerable advances in food, cattle, and money;\r\nbut the Indians pay little attention to fulfilling their contracts,\r\nand the legal means at the command of the planter for compelling\r\nthem to fulfill their past engagements are as burdensome and ruinous\r\nas even the abandonment of his rights. Unless the alcalde is active\r\nand shows good-will, the planters usually prefer not to press their\r\nclaims; they endure the loss, and many are thus induced to abandon\r\ntheir enterprises. This cancer on agriculture will disappear as soon\r\nas every Indian possesses a certificate of citizenship [Bürgerbrief;\r\nSpanish, cédula de vecindad]. If one weathers the first year, storms,\r\nlocusts, and business crises are to be expected later, all of which\r\ndepress the price of his product. In such cases it is for the planter\r\nthe greatest evil that no credit exists. There are no mortgages, at\r\nleast there is no compulsory registration of mortgages; accordingly,\r\nno one dares to lend his money on such estates, or he does it only at\r\ncrushing rates of usurious interest. An improvement in this respect is\r\nurgently demanded by the agricultural interests, both great and small,\r\nby the mercantile class, and by large and small estates; it would place\r\na limit to the pacto de retro, as well as to the usurious contracts\r\nwhich are called in Luzon tacalanan, in Bisaya alili--the furnishing\r\nof loans on the proceeds of the next harvest--to which must be ascribed\r\nthe misery and the backward conditions that prevail in many places....\r\n\r\nThe pacto de retro is one of the most usual modes in which landed\r\nproperty passes from the possession of the natives to others. A\r\nconsiderable part of Pampanga, Bataan, Manila, Laguna, Batangas,\r\nand other provinces has, within a few years, changed owners in this\r\nway. Thus also do the inexpressibly cunning and thrifty mestizos\r\nusually acquire their landed possessions, the cultivation of which\r\nthey then improve; but that does not prevent this custom from being\r\ndetrimental to the public welfare. The native who possesses a piece of\r\nland through placing it under cultivation and actually occupying it,\r\nbut almost never (or very seldom) by purchase from another owner, when\r\nhe finds himself in pressing need of money offers his land as a pledge\r\nfor the desired loan from a capitalist; but where he has no document to\r\nestablish and prove his just claim, no foundation exists for a loan on\r\nmortgage under moderate conditions, since the applicant is free from\r\nall burdens and obligations. The capitalist therefore looks for his\r\nown security in immediate possession. The hypotheca is converted into\r\nan antichresis security (prenda pretoria), and as it is with great\r\ndifficulty (or at least it very seldom occurs), that the Indian who\r\nreceives the money consents to pay it back at the appointed time,\r\nand it is not to the lender's interest to force him to pay it, the\r\nresult is, that for a sum corresponding to the secured loan--that is,\r\nfor a half or a third of the value of the security--the piece of land\r\nfinally changes proprietors. Not seldom it happens that the former\r\nproprietor remains on the land as a farmer (that is, as a laborer,\r\nin reality as a slave to his debts). Often the Indian is seduced into\r\ncontracts of this sort by his passion for cockfighting and gambling.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the country require the Indians to live in villages,\r\nuniting their farms into hamlets, so that they can be watched over\r\nand their tributes collected. In ordinary circumstances, the Indian\r\nbuilds for himself a hut in his field, where he lives while he is\r\nworking his land, and goes on Saturday evenings to the village in\r\norder to hear mass on Sunday. His field has no great value for him,\r\nsince he can always put another piece of land into cultivation,\r\nso great is the surplus of land in all the villages remote from\r\nthe capital. The facility with which he can abandon one tract to\r\ntake possession of another is very detrimental to the development\r\nof agriculture. A small landed proprietor, who has planted a bit of\r\nwaste land with rice or potatoes without asking any one's permission,\r\nraises an outcry if his garden is entered by a cow or a horse that\r\ngrazed there years ago; and, since the law stands in his favor, he\r\nis allowed to receive from the owner of the cattle payment for often\r\nimaginary damages, while the loss from such causes should be borne\r\nby him who cultivates a field without enclosing it.\r\n\r\nThis same small proprietor avails himself for his own benefit, of\r\nall the privileges and rights of an entire village of Indians, if a\r\nwealthy man desires to lay out a plantation in his neighborhood. The\r\ncapitalist who has decided on such a plan often finds that on land\r\nwhich was before entirely unfilled and waste, when he has after long\r\ndifficulties acquired control of his property, and has reckoned a\r\ncertain amount [of expense], some Indians have planted a grain field;\r\nand through testimonies covered with signatures, which are presented\r\nin the court, they assert that they inherited these very lands from\r\ntheir fathers, and have never ceased to work them.\r\n\r\nA remedy for these abuses would consist in the limitation of districts,\r\nand the jurisdiction of the municipality, so that, for the purpose\r\nof increasing the landed property for the inhabitants of a village,\r\nso much land should remain free as they could at the time reasonably\r\nclaim--more or less than the so-called municipal field (legua comunal),\r\nof which, besides, no law makes mention. All the remaining land\r\nlocated within the jurisdiction should be declared the property of\r\nthe crown, and the title to all possessions then located outside of\r\nmunicipal control should be valid; but in future all possessions that\r\nshall not conform to the said rules shall be declared invalid. Within\r\nthe municipal limits or the legal property of the village (which may\r\nnot extend beyond the sound of the bell) the native farmer should be\r\nallowed to dwell, [even] outside of the village, in the midst of the\r\nlands cultivated by him; and only in case he alienates or abandons\r\nthese should he be compelled to live in the village. The natives\r\nshould bring new plots under cultivation within the municipality,\r\nand be able to acquire these by paying to the communal treasury\r\na small ground-rent, or a moderate sum once for all. Such grants\r\nshould proceed, with all publicity, from the entire body of the\r\nnotables, with the cooperation of the parish priest, and be recorded\r\nin a safely-kept book in every village, and should never contain\r\na greater area than the applicant can till with his own carabaos\r\n[Büffeln]. If such grant of state land does not exceed a quinõn, it\r\nshould be issued, according to the aforesaid forms, by the alcalde\r\n[221] of the province; if of greater extent, in the capital of the\r\ncolony; but all ought to be recorded in the land-register of the\r\nprovince and village concerned. Those measures that were taken for\r\nthe benefit of the natives and the promotion of cattle-raising, but\r\nwhich have an opposite effect, ought to be abolished. Agriculture,\r\nlike every other occupation, needs no protection save clearness and\r\nsecurity in its essential conditions of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC SOCIETY OF FRIENDS OF THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n[The following account of this association and the more notable of\r\nits achievements is obtained from Fernandez and Moreno's Manual del\r\nviajero en Filipinas (Manila, 1875), pp. 173-178. This subject is\r\npresented here as being so largely connected with the progress of\r\nagriculture in Filipinas.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFounded in the year 1781, in virtue of a royal order dated August\r\n27 in the preceding year (issued in consequence of advices from the\r\nexcellent governor Don José Basco y Vargas), in 1787 it suspended\r\nits meetings on account of the gradual and progressive decline of the\r\nsociety. In 1819 it resumed its functions, but suffered a period of\r\ndiscouragement and paralysis as a result of the Asiatic cholera morbus,\r\nwhich appeared then for the first time in these islands; and until\r\nOctober, 1822, the few meetings which the society held had no other\r\nobject than questions of internal order, having little interest or\r\nimportance for its history. [222] A memoir published by the society\r\nwith date of January 1, 1860, [223] makes the following statement:\r\n\"From that date (October 22, 1822), it can be said, begins the series\r\nof the society's labors and services--achievements all the greater and\r\nmore valuable, inasmuch as they proceeded from slight and ephemeral\r\ncauses, and from a corporation which could not depend on material\r\nresources even remotely proportioned to the magnitude of its object;\r\nand which plunged into labors [which meant] nothing less than the\r\nadvancement and civilization of a virgin country, containing more\r\nthan 8,000 square leguas of surface, with 3,000,000 of inhabitants\r\nstill half-barbarous, and without stable or established mercantile\r\nrelations with any part of the world (on account of the recent\r\ncrisis in the privileged commerce, which bad just been abolished),\r\nwith a capital of 30,000 pesos, at 5,000 leguas distance from European\r\ncivilization, and with a government occupied besides with the political\r\nsituation and calamities of those days, confiding only in its patriotic\r\nenthusiasm and in its desires for the aggrandizement and prosperity\r\nof the country.\" In the above memoir are concisely recorded three\r\nhundred forty-seven notable achievements, all beneficial to the\r\ncountry, accomplished by that distinguished society in the space of\r\nthirty-seven years. We would gladly reproduce entire in our modest\r\nbook the relation of services so important; as we cannot do this,\r\nwe indicate those which, in our judgment, are the more notable.\r\n\r\n1823. February 1--Free distribution of one thousand three hundred\r\ntwenty copies of [books of] grammar, orthography, and reading-lessons,\r\nfor popular use.

We do not doubt that it will continue its\r\nvigilant efforts, in order to realize, as far as possible its motto,\r\n\"Public felicity.\" The chronological record of its resolutions\r\nfrom 1822 to 1860 also forms a memorial of the progress which has\r\nbeen made in this country in agriculture and industries; [230] and,\r\nalthough it is not strictly proper for this place, we set down here,\r\nin continuation, some data referring to the said acts, for the purpose\r\nof bringing together in this section of our work all the activities\r\nin which the said Economic Society has exerted an influence.\r\n\r\n1822.

In the former the\r\nposition of the moon was to be determined by its measured distance from\r\nsome star, in the latter from the sun. Since risings and settings at an\r\nassumed horizon are specified, it is probable that the distance between\r\nmoon and sun was determined by the time interval of their respective\r\nrisings and settings. The fourth method is that still known by the same\r\nname. The statement of the third method is obscure. It may mean that\r\nthe longitude was to be found by a measured distance on the surface\r\nof the earth from a station whose longitude was already known. This\r\ndistance could be turned into difference of longitude if the length\r\ncorresponding to a degree of longitude in that latitude were first\r\ndetermined. This method is used today in geodetic operations.\"\r\n\r\nP. 218, note 184: The India House of Trade (Casa de Contratación) was\r\ncreated by a decree of Isabel of Castilla (January 14, 1503) as both a\r\ncommercial board and a tribunal; and it partly replaced the admiralty\r\ncourt which had been established in Sevilla since the thirteenth\r\ncentury, the quarters of the latter (in the old Alcázar) being\r\nassigned to the India House when the latter was first organized. The\r\npowers of the India House increased greatly in the course of time,\r\nand it was subordinate to no council save that of the Indias; in\r\n1583 a chamber of justice was added to it. This institution was, by a\r\ndecree of 1717, removed in the following year to Cádiz. An interesting\r\nstudy on the India House is found in Los trabajos geográficos de\r\nla Casa de Contratación (Sevilla, 1900), by Manuel de la Puente y\r\nOlea. This work--prepared by careful examination of the documents in\r\nthe archives--is devoted to the early voyages of discovery that were\r\nundertaken under the auspices of the India House and its navigators,\r\nending with that of Loaysa (1525); the geographical studies made by\r\nits cosmographers, and other scientific researches connected with\r\nits enterprises; and the enrichment of the fauna and flora of the\r\nNew World due to the conveyance thither of useful plants, fruits,\r\nand animals through the agency of the House.

The group contains 17 islands, which--excepting Guam,\r\nthe largest--belong to Germany, or, as it is called, \"the German\r\nNew Guinea Protectorate,\" having been transferred to that power\r\nby Spain in 1899, together with the Carolinas and Palaos, for\r\n25,000,000 pesetas. The original inhabitants (a Polynesian people)\r\nare known as Chamorros; but in later years a large Filipino element\r\n(soldiers and others) has mingled with them, and the people show a\r\npreponderance of the Filipino type. In 1898 the population of the\r\ngroup, exclusive of Guam (which contained about 9,000 people), was\r\n1,938. Little was done for them by the Spaniards until 1668, when\r\na Jesuit mission went to the Marianas under the direction of Diego\r\nLuis San Vítores. The attempts of the privileged class of natives\r\nto keep the new faith from the common people resulted in the loss of\r\nprestige by the former, conflict between the two classes, and martyrdom\r\nfor some of the Jesuits--San Vítores meeting death thus on April 2,\r\n1672. Nevertheless the missions made progress, and a few years later\r\nthe Jesuits counted eight churches, three colleges, and over 50,000\r\nconverts (Crétineau-Joly, v, pp. 30-22). The military conquest of\r\nthe islands by Spain was accomplished during the years 1676-98; and\r\nthey were occupied from that time by a governor and a small force\r\nof troops. In 1828 a new plan for the government of these islands\r\nwas formed at Madrid, by which the royal estates were suppressed,\r\nand the lands divided among the natives, who were also provided with\r\ncattle and tools at low rates; the governors were forbidden to trade,\r\nindustries and commerce were declared open to the natives, and free\r\nports were named. In 1855 Felipe de la Corte y Ruano Calderon went to\r\nthe Marianas as governor, with orders to make certain needed reforms,\r\nand to make a full report on the condition of the islands, which\r\nhe did. During the Spanish-American war of 1898, Guam was occupied\r\nby the United States before the governor had even heard of the\r\noutbreak of hostilities. For information regarding these islands,\r\ntheir people, and history, consult Montero y Vidal's Historia de\r\nFilipinas--which contains (i, pp. 350-352) a list of authorities,\r\nboth MS. and printed--and Archipiélago filipino, pp. 438-442; 2nd\r\nbibliographies of the Philippines, especially those of Retana, Griffin,\r\nand Vindel, already cited, and Griffin's List of Books on Samoa and\r\nGuam (Washington, 1901).

Penas de cámara in the laws of the Indies\r\nhad, I think, especial reference to the various penalties provided,\r\nespecially against officials for any non-performance of duty, by the\r\nCouncil of the Indias; and there was a special board of accountants\r\nfor the fund of these fines, in connection with that Council.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the phrase contador de resultas, I have obtained (through\r\nthe kindness of Fenton R. McCreery, secretary of the American Embassy\r\nat Mexico City) some further information, furnished by Señor José\r\nAlgara, Under-secretary for Foreign Affairs of Mexico. He thinks\r\nthat the above phrase is equivalent to glosador, [that is, to one\r\nwho makes comments or explanations, or who \"designates any amount in\r\norder to call attention to the examination or proof of the account\r\nto which the item belongs\" (Domínguez)], or to segundo contador [\"a\r\nsecond accountant\"]. Señor Algara states that the references to the\r\naccountants for the colonies in the laws of the Indias (book viii,\r\ntitles i and ii) did not define the character and duties of the various\r\nofficers, because that had already been done in the Nueva Recopilación\r\n(title ii, law v, no. 1). He also cites from Nicolás M. Serrano's\r\nDiccionario universal the following definition of contador de resultus:\r\n\"Any one of those persons in the first grade of the chief accountancy\r\n[Contaduría Mayor de Cuentas], which corresponds to those officials\r\nemployed in former times by the comptroller-in-chief [contador mayor]\r\nwho were occupied in computing or transcribing the amounts in the\r\naccount-books of the obligations which are incurred by those persons\r\nwho administer the royal revenues by lease or by other title.\"--James\r\nA.

LeRoy says of this, in a private\r\nletter: \"'Arrangement' also conveys somewhat the same idea--that\r\nis, the rearrangement of their rights, or the reconciliation of\r\nrights prescribed in this decree. Composición de derechos means,\r\nquite closely rendered, 'reconciliation of rights,' according to\r\nmy recollection of its use in certain contracts which I have seen\r\nhere in Mexico. It gives the idea of arbitration, to some degree,\r\nof rights more or less in conflict which are reconciled by agreement.\"\r\n\r\nP. 147, line 7: Consolidations of encomiendas were made, in order\r\nto abolish those which were too small, or make a more equitable\r\ndistribution of the territory comprised in those which were very\r\nlarge. Pensions were also assessed against large encomiendas,\r\nalthough in the laws of the Indias it was ordained that the maximum\r\namount of such pensions should be 2,000 pesos. Apparently the aim\r\nof this decree was, to provide that in extending the tenure of the\r\nencomiendas and rearranging them the royal officials should also\r\nmake allowance for the charges against the encomiendas in the way\r\nof pensions, so consolidating them as to accord with the decrees of\r\nprevious years on this subject. Those decrees sought to prevent an\r\nencomendero from being deprived of a fair income by the assessment of\r\ntoo many pensions against it (for wives, relatives, or dependents of\r\nprevious encomenderos of the same district; or for other services to\r\nthe State, paid for by assigning portions of remunerative encomiendas);\r\nand at the same time aimed to restrict the income to be derived from an\r\nencomienda, and to make these incomes nearly uniform in value.--James\r\nA.

It is altogether probable that\r\nthe man chosen sometimes had to pay that official, and that Mas is\r\nhere reporting this as another of the abuses which, under the early\r\nSpanish régime, the friars used to charge against the alcaldes-mayor,\r\nin that sense, being a 'robbery' of the natives.\"\r\n\r\nP. 266, line 2: For \"271-275\" read \"271-273.\"\r\n\r\nP. 321, line 3: The statements of this writer would make it appear\r\nthat the friars developed the resources of Negros; but that is not\r\nthe fact. The old régime described by Mas and Jagor failed to develop\r\nthose resources; and the modern development of Negros (which dragged\r\nthe friars reluctantly after it) was accomplished through foreign\r\ncommerce and foreign traders, a part of the general development of\r\nthe Philippines as a whole. This very document shows how, when it was\r\nseen to be beginning, through Spanish and Spanish half-caste planters,\r\nto whose aid British importers of machinery of the modern sort soon\r\nafter came, the friars stepped in to claim an island which since the\r\nSpanish discovery they had sadly neglected, and to wrest its growing\r\ncuracies from native priests. This friar's claims (pp. 319-322)\r\nare all the more audacious in view of the proximity to his own time\r\nof the development, through foreign agencies, which he claims as due\r\nto his order. There are other parts of this same Recollect chronicle\r\nwhich show how the modern political bitterness of spirit had crept\r\ninto the accounts of Philippine history emanating from the religious\r\norders.--James A.

But\r\nit was not possible for the Duke de Almodovar to make it known to his\r\ncountrymen without variations and emendations, since it was one of\r\nthe works included in the Indexes of the Holy Office; he therefore\r\ncontrived to present it as a work imitated rather than produced,\r\nwithout daring to mention even once the name of the author, or to\r\nprint his own on the title page, substituting for the latter the\r\nanagram of 'Malo de Luque.' This recasting was very skilfully done;\r\nhe suppressed what could not be published; and added information and\r\nvery judicious reflections upon commerce in general and on that of our\r\n[Spanish] possessions.

Although nominally the property of Spain, these islands\r\nwere greatly neglected by the Spaniards, even into the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Their attention was directed for a time to the Palaos by the\r\nevent described in Clain's letter, and various attempts were made,\r\nbut unsuccessfully, to establish Christian missions therein, two\r\nJesuits, Duberon and José Cortil, being killed by natives in 1710,\r\nand another, Antonio Cantova, meeting the same fate in 1731. In the\r\nlatter half of the last century, German interests gained ascendency\r\nin the islands, which led to their absorption by Germany. Jagor\r\ncites (Reisen, pp. 215, 216) several historical instances of Palaos\r\nislanders being carried by storms to the coasts of Filipinas; and\r\nadds, \"Later, I had in Manila an opportunity to photograph a group of\r\npeople from the Paláos and Caroline Islands, who a year previously had\r\nbeen cast by a storm on the coast of Samar.\" He also says (p. 203):\r\n\"As Dr. Gräffe (who spent many years in the Micronesas) informs me,\r\nPaláos is an indefinite expression, like Kanaka and so many others,\r\nand certainly does not designate the inhabitants of the Pelew group\r\nexclusively.\" Regarding these islands, see Montero y Vidal's Hist. de\r\nFilipinas, i, pp. 31, 402-409, 455-473. and his Archipiélago filipino,\r\npp. 469-505; also Miguel's Estudio de las Islas Carolinas, and the\r\nvarious bibliographies of the Philippines, especially Griffin's List,\r\nand Vindel's Catálogo biblioteca filipina.

Note 11: In the Philippine Journal of Science\r\n(published by the Bureau of Science, Manila), for October, 1906, is\r\nan interesting paper on \"The Non-Christian Tribes of Northern Luzon,\"\r\nby Dean C. Worcester, secretary of the interior in the government\r\nof the islands. He endeavors to furnish a systematic classification\r\nof these tribes; repeats the lists made by the Jesuits, Professor\r\nBlumentritt, and Dr. Barrows, criticizing each of these, and in some\r\nrespects differing from their methods; and then enumerates the separate\r\ntribes, as classified by himself--giving under each, the synonyms of\r\nthe tribal name, with other names which may be classed under this;\r\n\"its habitat, so far as it is at present known;\" and description of\r\nits people, and of their dress, homes, mode of life, occupations,\r\ncustoms, etc. A similar paper on those tribes in Southern Luzon\r\nis announced for the coming year. For these papers Worcester has\r\nutilized personal observations made on these peoples not only by\r\nhimself, but by numerous other government officials both civil and\r\nmilitary, during the years 1900-06; and special information regarding\r\nthem obtained in the census enumeration of 1903. He says (p. 802):\r\n\"It is not too much to say that hardly a rancheria now remains in\r\nthe Cordillera Central and its foothills, except in the district of\r\nApayos, which has not been visited by Americans, while even in the\r\nlatter district twenty-nine of the more important rancherias have\r\nbeen visited.\" The above paper contains excellent illustrations made\r\nfrom 208 photographs, taken by Worcester himself or other government\r\nofficials. Other valuable papers announced for the Journal in 1907\r\nare: \"The Tagbanua and Mangyan Alphabets,\" by T. H. Pardo de Tavera;\r\n\"The Subanos of the Zamboangan Peninsula,\" by Edwin B. Christie; and\r\n\"Primitive Philippine Fire-making Apparatus,\" by Dean C. Worcester.\r\n\r\nP. 78, note 13: Worcester recognizes but seven distinct non-Christian\r\ntribes in northern Luzon: the Negritos, Ilongots (Ibilaos), Kalingas,\r\nIfugaos, Bontoc Igorots, Lepanto-Benguet Igorots, and Tinguians. He\r\nsays of some of these tribal designations (\"Non-Christian Tribes of\r\nN. Luzon,\" p. 804): \"The Altasanes, Ifumangies [the same as Jumangi],\r\nIleabanes, and Panuipuyes do not exist. In all probability these\r\nlatter names were taken from those of rancherias which have long\r\nsince disappeared. While some of the larger rancherias in northern\r\nLuzon are very old, others are of recent origin and the names and\r\nlocations of these settlements are constantly changing.\"\r\n\r\nP. 102, line 5: It gives us pleasure to publish the following\r\ninformation furnished by Dr. N.

Gaspar Naranjo, \"who traveled through\r\nEspaña late in the seventeenth century, asserts that, according to\r\nhis knowledge, in 1480 Toledo consumed 450,000 libras of silk, which\r\ncould furnish the supply for 15,000 looms. Although this number was\r\ngreatly lessened when the Escorial was completed, yet from the looms\r\nof Toledo proceeded the richest silks for church adornments, ribbons,\r\nand hangings. In the year 1651 Toledo still counted 5,000 looms in\r\noperation, although not all within the city; a little afterward, there\r\nwere not more than two thousand; in 1714 they were reduced to seventy,\r\nand finally to none at all. When the remnants of this manufacture\r\nleft Toledo, that of Valencia gained strength, but never to the\r\nextent which might have been if legislation had permitted it. The\r\nMoors had left that of Granada in the best condition; years after\r\nthe conquest it maintained 5,000 spinning-wheels, and the kingdom\r\nyielded a million libras of good silk; but just at this point began\r\nthe exactions of the revenue officials, and likewise, in consequence,\r\nthe decadence of this industry. It was declared subject to the payment\r\nof alçabala, which was a tax of fourteen per cent when once the tenth\r\nwas applied as an ecclesiastical income; eight maravedís besides\r\nwere charged to it for the impost called tortil [i.e., spiral?],\r\nand nine maravedís more for a municipal tax. When with the increase\r\nfrom successive impositions the management of this revenue became\r\ntoo complicated, all these duties were combined in one; and then it\r\nwas seen that every libra of silk paid, as its share of the taxes,\r\nthe enormous amount of very nearly fifteen and one-half reals. With\r\nthe increase in taxes, the production steadily diminished; by 1643,\r\nthat of Granada had decreased from a million to one-fourth of that\r\namount, and not long afterward to 80,000, and even less. The silk\r\nindustry, thus burdened, had to compete with that of Genoa, whence\r\nlarge shipments of silk goods were freely imported into Spanish\r\nports, and sold at lower prices than the goods made in España; and\r\na mortal blow was dealt to it when the exportation of Spanish silks\r\nwas prohibited, and sumptuary laws reserved the use of silk fabrics\r\nto a few classes. It is astonishing that this industry has been able\r\nto survive up to the present epoch, although it is in a languishing\r\ncondition.\" (Arias y Miranda, Examen crítico-histórico, pp. 154, 155.)\r\n\r\nP. 267, note 78, line 7 from end: For \"p. 278\" read \"p. 279.\"\r\n\r\nP. 286, note 87: The document here mentioned was afterward shifted\r\nto another place; the reference should be to VOL.

It is the common garb\r\nof Europeans and upper-class natives in the tropics. This usage among\r\nSpaniards seems to have died out in Spanish America, but the word is\r\ncommon in the Philippines, where it is probably a survival from earlier\r\nSpanish-American usage, transplanted to those islands. Many Spanish\r\nwriters mention with contempt the way in which class distinctions in\r\ndress vanished among Spaniards in the Philippines (save, of course,\r\namong the military, ecclesiastical, and high official classes). So too,\r\nthe donning of the Americana meant the assumption of social prestige\r\nor aspirations by the Filipinos. Only a few years ago, nearly all the\r\nlatter wore the gauze shirt outside of the trousers; but in recent\r\nyears the younger men of education, even in the villages, and gradually\r\nthe older men, have been adopting the Americana for ordinary wear--a\r\nchange which has been greatly accelerated during American occupation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME LII\r\n\r\nP. 309, line 12: Through lack of space, we are prevented from\r\ngiving (as we had intended) an adequate treatment of the subject\r\nof commerce as a special topic, from the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury to that of the nineteenth.

I), and in LeRoy's contribution\r\nto the present volume; also writings named in the bibliographies of\r\nGriffin, Pardo de Tavera, Vindel, and Retana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This is Sinibaldo de Mas, a noted Spanish traveler and diplomat. He\r\nwas born at Barcelona, in 1809, and studied at Madrid, especially\r\nthe classic languages, Arabic and other modern languages. In 1634,\r\nhe was sent on a diplomatic mission to the Orient, where he visited\r\nsuccessively Constantinople, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Calcutta,\r\nthe Arabian desert, and lastly Manila, where he lived for some\r\nmonths. After his return to the Peninsula, he was appointed Spanish\r\nminister plenipotentiary to China. Pardo de Tavera says of him\r\n(Biblioteca Filipina, p. 253): \"The work of Mas is highly interesting,\r\nonly that, having sojourned a very short time in Filipinas, during\r\nwhich he was sick most of the time, he wrote his work by reference\r\nto others, and taking from the chronicles of the friars the elements\r\nnecessary for the history and the races. He does not cite sources, and\r\nit is cleverly written, and passes with some persons as a classic work\r\non Filipinas.... His vanity led him to suppress his name....\" Pardo de\r\nTavera does not seem to know the third volume. Retana [who possessed a\r\ncopy of the third volume (No. 2432 in his library, which was sold to\r\nthe Compañía general de tabacos de Filipinas), says in Bibliografía\r\nfilipina, p. 524]: \"This third and secret part has never been\r\ndescribed. The author published very few copies of it because of the\r\ngravity of its contents. Sinibaldo de Mas contrary to what those who\r\nknow his Estado [i.e., the first two volumes] may imagine, pronounced\r\nin favor of preparation of independence for Filipinas.\" In this third\r\nvolume Mas precedes the text as follows: \"Of this secret chapter, the\r\nlast of the Informe sobre el estado de las Islas Filipinas en 1842,\r\nonly some few copies have been printed for the ministers, gentlemen of\r\nthe Council of the Government, and other persons influential in the\r\naffairs of the nation. Consequently, your Excellency is requested\r\nto keep it for your own use, without allowing it to circulate or\r\npermitting a copy to be made of it.\" The copy belonging to the Peabody\r\nInstitute Library belonged to Javier de Burgos. See (in addition to\r\nPardo de Tavera and Retana) Dic. encic. Hisp.-Amer., xii, p. 537.\r\n\r\n[2] The first two volumes have separately paged chapters as follows:\r\nI. Origin of the inhabitants of Oceanica. Condition of the Filipinos\r\nat the arrival of the Spaniards. History of the Spanish domination in\r\nFilipinas from their discovery until our times. Continuation of the\r\nlast chapter. Population. Animals. Climate. Minerals. Topography.\r\nII. Languages. Vegetables. Agriculture. Interior commerce. Foreign\r\ncommerce. Industry. Territorial division. Administration of government\r\nand the captaincy-general. Public instruction. Ecclesiastical\r\ncondition. Administration of justice. Army. Navy. Direct and indirect\r\ntaxes. External political condition. Vol. i contains a chart showing\r\nthe ancient alphabets of the Filipinos; and vol. ii, a map of the\r\narchipelago.\r\n\r\n[3] A note by Mas at this point discusses the other admissible\r\nplan, \"namely, to cede the country to some foreign power.\" But the\r\nreligious, the majority of the military and civil employes, and the\r\nFilipino-Spaniards would prefer independence to transfer, and the\r\nsimple announcement of such transfer would lead to almost universal\r\ninsurrection. The fatal results that ensued from the former English\r\npolicy of sending convicts to their colonies declares against making\r\nthe Philippines a penal colony. Another plan, namely, to send out\r\nSpanish emigrants from the Peninsula, is also not feasible, for Spain\r\nhas no surplus population, and in fact needs a greater population. On\r\nthe matter of penal colonies, Forrest (Voyage, p. 198) says, \"The\r\nSpaniards at Manila transport convicts to Samboangan, as England did\r\nto America.\" In 1875-78, there was some discussion of the question\r\nas to whether Spain should establish penal colonies (like that of\r\nBotany Bay) in the Marianas Islands or in the Gulf of Guinea.\r\n\r\n[4] By this term, as well as by \"Filipino Spaniards,\" as used in\r\nthis document, are meant those of full Spanish blood born in the\r\nPhilippines, or those who went to the Philippines in childhood.\r\n\r\n[5] The Consejo Supremo de Indias, which was established, according to\r\nthe best authorities, in 1511 by the great Ferdinand, was perfected\r\nby Cárlos I, and was reformed by Felipe II. It was composed of a\r\npresident, a number of togated ministers, and an indefinite number of\r\ncounselors by brevet, and they all received the same consideration as\r\ndid members of the Consejo de Castilla. This corporation, which had\r\nhad so great influence in Spanish colonial matters, was suppressed\r\nby royal decree of May 24, 1834, and in its place was erected the\r\nTribunal Supremo de España é Indias, which was renamed Consejo de\r\nEstado in 1856. See Dic. encic. Hisp.-Amer., v, p. 827.\r\n\r\n[6] The exact title of this work is as follows: Los diez y seis\r\nmeses de mando superior de Filipinas, por el mariscal de campo\r\nD. Andres G. Camba (Cadiz, 1839). Pardo de Tavera (Bibl. Filipina,\r\np. 79) says of it: \"This pamphlet is full of curious revelations and\r\nexplanations relative to the command of this general, which was so\r\nfilled with incidents.\" Retána (Bibliografía, p. 57) says that Camba\r\nwas a democrat sui generis. The book is a long exposition of 101\r\npages, to which are appended various documents (53 pages) on which\r\nthe exposition is based. The copy of this pamphlet now in the Boston\r\nPublic Library was formerly in the Retana collection.\r\n\r\n[7] See account of this mutiny in VOL. LI, pp. 47, 48.\r\n\r\n[8] See post, pp. 92, 93, note 37.\r\n\r\n[9] See post, pp. 91-111, the report by Matta.\r\n\r\n[10] In a long note at this point, Mas severely criticises Camba's\r\nbook, which he has already mentioned. He declares it lacking in\r\nknowledge of the Philippines, and says that it was written to prove\r\nthat the Philippines are thoroughly loyal in every respect. Mas's own\r\nexperience pointed to the existence of an independence party among\r\nthe Spaniards of the colony. Mas condemns Camba's policy of giving\r\nposts to the natives; as well as Camba's assertions of the immunity\r\nof the governor from removal at the will of the monarch. Camba is\r\naccused of a change of sentiment from that which he had during his\r\nfirst years of residence in the country.\r\n\r\n[11] Mas refers to the culture system practiced by the Dutch in the\r\nisland of Java, 1830-1870. Clive Day (Policy and administration of\r\nthe Dutch in Java, New York and London, 1904) compares it to the\r\nsystem of forced cultures established by Spain in the Philippines\r\nin 1780. In addition to the above book, see the following for the\r\nhistory of Dutch colonization in Java: J. W. B. Money's Java, or how\r\nto govern a colony (London, 1861); P. J. Veth's Java (Haarlem, 1896-);\r\nJules Leclercq's Un sejour dans l'île de Java (Paris, 1898); Wilhelm\r\nKrüger's Das Zuckerrohr und seine Kultur (Magdeburg und Wien, 1899);\r\nand Pierre Gonnaud's La Colonisation hollandaise à Java (Paris, 1905).\r\n\r\n[12] A note at this point by Mas mentions a recent pamphlet by a\r\nCuban who advocates complete autonomy for the colonies, and freedom\r\nof the press. This author says that long before the French revolution\r\nfree negroes and mulattoes were being educated in Paris; but Mas says\r\npeople of that class in Cuba do not travel in foreign countries or\r\nreceive an education in European colleges.\r\n\r\n[13] Mas cites a passage from Captain Gabriel Lafond's Quinze ans\r\nde voyages autour du monde (1840) to the effect that the Philippine\r\nconquest was one of religion. The power of the friars grows because\r\nthey are permanent in the colony. Their influence over the natives\r\nis all powerful, and they regard foreigners and even other Spaniards\r\nwith suspicion. The friars asserted that the natives to be happy had\r\nno need of European civilization; yet they prevented progress by not\r\nallowing the entrance of industry. Spain did not suppress the orders\r\nin the Philippines, fearing lest it lead to independence. The native\r\npriests are those most hostile to the friars. They are almost without\r\neducation and often dissolute; and are sure to be the first authors\r\nof a revolution. Natives should be excluded from the priesthood.\r\n\r\n[14] The insurrection which occurred recently in Tayabas is a patent\r\nproof of these truths. The cura of the village where the confraternity\r\nof San José was established, advised the alcalde of the province\r\nin time of the suspicions with which it infused him. And since the\r\nalcalde-mayor refused to consider the matter, he wrote him: \"You will\r\nbe the first victim,\" as in truth he was. The cura of the next village\r\nalso took great interest in it, and so many letters were written to\r\nthe archbishop of Manila from various places, that the latter sent\r\nan official communication to the captain-general. Orders were then\r\nissued for the arrest of Apolinario de Santa Cruz, but he fled. The\r\nbrothers [of the confraternity] held their meetings in the village of\r\nMahahay. The cura informed the archbishop thereof, telling him that,\r\nnotwithstanding all that he had done, he had been unable to dissuade\r\nthem from this undertaking. The archbishop sent this advice to the\r\ngovernment. To the curas, then, was due the discovery of that crafty\r\nconspiracy; and it is almost beyond the pale of doubt that if there had\r\nbeen no others than Filipino parish priests in the villages (as has\r\nbeen once ordered by the government), there would not have been the\r\nslightest suspicion of it, until it had been so firmly and generally\r\norganized that our ruin would have been the work of a week. (Note\r\nby Mas.)\r\n\r\n[15] Either Mas has simply indicated the letter in his heading, or\r\nthe person who transcribed the copy from which we translate failed to\r\ncopy the extract in question. It will be remembered that Mas published\r\nmost of the letter in his vol. i, in the chapter on population. The\r\nreference is evidently to sections 95-100 (q.v., VOL. XL, pp. 270-277).\r\n\r\n[16] Manuel Grijalbo (sic), O.S.A., went to the Philippines in 1810,\r\nand after acting as cura and holding the highest positions in the\r\nprovince, was appointed bishop of Nueva Cáceres, being consecrated\r\nJan. 28, 1849. He died at the episcopal palace, Nov. 13, 1861.\r\n\r\nFausto Lopez, O.S.A., was born in 1811, took his vows at Valladolid in\r\n1828, and went to the Philippines in 1829. He was located in Cebú until\r\n1837, when he became provincial secretary. Afterwards he held several\r\noffices and acted as cura until his death at Manila, April 17, 1866.\r\n\r\nManuel Jarava, O.S.A., was born at Zaragoza in 1804 and professed\r\nat Valladolid in 1827. He was in the Philippines from 1829 to 1834,\r\nreturning in the latter year to Spain. The date of his death is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nSee Pérez's Catálogo.\r\n\r\n[17] Manuel Maria Cambronero was a Spanish jurisconsult. He was born\r\nin Orihuela in 1765 and died in 1834. During the French invasion,\r\nhe acted as secretary of the Council of State, on account of which\r\nhe was compelled to leave the country when the French left. He later\r\nreturned to Madrid, where he opened a buffet, which was the most\r\ncelebrated one of his time. See Dic. encic. Hisp.-Amer., iv, p. 330.\r\n\r\n[18] A tribute paid to the church by all Filipinos from the age\r\nof sixteen.\r\n\r\n\"Since 1852 the tribute amounts to 12 reals, and in some districts\r\nspecial rates are fixed. Not until 1841 was the payment of the tribute\r\nin cash made universal. There are, besides, three other taxes;\r\nthe sanctorum, 3 reals; the comunidad, 1 real; and the recargo,\r\n1/2 real. The total of imposts, then, is 16 1/2 reals; or for\r\neach single person one dollar and 1/4 real. The sanctorum is for\r\n[the expenses of] worship; but it is paid to the government, which\r\npays the minister at the rate of 180 dollars for 500 tributes. The\r\ncomunidad is a charge for the communal fund. The recargo is a charge\r\nintroduced since the suppression of the brandy monopoly, to cover the\r\ndeficit resulting therefrom. In Mindanao and the Bisayas no additional\r\ncharge is collected. According to Agius (Memoria, doc. 5) each single\r\ntribute-payer now contributes 6.25 reals, plus 0.55 reals of recargo,\r\nin all 6.8 reals, not considering the sanctorum and comunidad. The\r\ninhabitants of Abra, Ilocos, and Union pay, besides, 1 1/2 to 2 1/4\r\nreals for the permission to buy their tobacco outside the monopoly\r\ndealers.\" \"Mestizos by a Chinese man and an Indian woman pay a tribute\r\nof $3.00 a year since 1852; earlier, it was less. The Indian woman\r\nmarried to a mestizo of this class pays the same tribute as he during\r\ntheir marriage; but when she becomes a widow she pays only as an Indian\r\nwoman. Mestizos who, like the natives, cultivate the soil with their\r\nown hands, also pay only as the latter do. The mestizos form their own\r\nbarangays when there are 25 to 30 tributes of them living together;\r\notherwise they belong to the nearest barangay of natives. Every\r\nChinaman--excepting tillers of the soil, from whom only 12 reals are\r\ncollected--pays since 1852 a [capitation] head-tax of $6.00, and,\r\nbesides this, an industrial tax of $100, $60, $30, or $12.\"\r\n\r\n\"A law issued Nov. 3, 1863 (Legis. ultramar [compiled by Rodriguez\r\nS. Pedro, pub. at Madrid, 1865] iii), actually decided that every\r\nmale inhabitant of the Philippines--European or native, Spanish\r\nor foreign--must render personal service for twenty-four days in\r\nthe year, or else procure release from it by a money payment. But\r\nthis law was not put into execution, and Europeans are free from all\r\nimposts. Mestizos by Spaniards and Indian women are similarly exempt,\r\nsave that they pay 7 reals for the sanctorum, and 1/2 real as a tithe\r\nfor the government; little care, however, is taken for exactness in\r\nthe enumeration of the mestizos, especially of their women.\" (Jagor,\r\nReisen, pp. 293-295.)\r\n\r\n[19] The Colegio de Agustinos, or Colegio de Filipinas, at Valladolid,\r\nwould probably come under this category.\r\n\r\n[20] The use of steam vessels against the Moros was introduced in 1847,\r\nand proved an immediate benefit.\r\n\r\n[21] See VOL. LI, notes 6, 7, 14, 16, 31.\r\n\r\n[22] This was Admiral Cyrille-Pierre-Théodore Laplace, who was born at\r\nsea Nov. 7, 1793, and died at Brest, Jan. 22, 1875. The book mentioned\r\nby Mas is the Voyage autour du monde par les mers de l'Inde et de la\r\nChine (1833-39). The matte on the Philippines is contained in vol. i,\r\npp. 353-470, 547-553, and is as follows: \"Manille; description de\r\nLuçon; quelques details sur son gouvernement, ses habitants, leurs\r\nmoeurs et leur industrie;\" and notes. See La grande encyclopédie,\r\nxxi, p. 947; and the Philippine bibliography issued by the Library\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\n[23] The office of army intendant was created by royal orders of July\r\n17 and 26, 1784, in accordance with the proposition of Governor Basco;\r\nto the office was united that of the subdelegate superintendency\r\nof the treasury. The new office was independent of the superior\r\ngovernment of the islands. The first incumbent of the new office was\r\nCiriaco Gonzalez Carvajal, then auditor of the royal Audiencia and\r\nassessor-general of the government. See Montero y Vidal, Historia\r\ngeneral, ii, pp. 311, 312.\r\n\r\n[24] The first edition of the Recopilación de leyes de Indias was\r\npublished at Madrid in 1681.\r\n\r\n[25] For the powers of the alcaldes-mayor, see VOL. XVII, pp. 323,\r\n324, and 333, 334.\r\n\r\n[26] i.e., A report of the matter must be made to the government,\r\nthrough its respective ministries, and after deliberation the course\r\nto be followed would be ordered. Throughout the history of the\r\nPhilippines, this method often proved a great drawback to effective\r\ngovernment, because of the distance from Spain and difficulty of\r\ncommunication; so much so that when the answer was received, the\r\nmatter was already wellnigh or completely a dead letter.\r\n\r\n[27] On leaving his office Francisco Enriquez left two printed\r\ndocuments as follows: Oficio al Secretario de Estado dando cuenta de\r\nhaber hecho entrega de la Intendencia á D. Luis Urrejola (Manila,\r\nJune 11, 1836; 2 leaves on rice paper); and Entrega que hace de\r\nsus funciones, en este dia, el Intendente general de Ejercito\r\n... al Ecsmo. Sr. D. Luis Urrejola (Manila, July 11, 1836; in 16\r\nleaves). The document mentioned by Mas must be one of these. See\r\nRetana's Bibliografia filipina, pp. 54, 55 (the title to the first\r\ndocument is made by Retana).\r\n\r\n[28] i.e., All the papers belonging to any matter, judicial,\r\nlegislative, or executive, consisting of orders, opinions, reports,\r\nand all other measures.\r\n\r\n[29] A note at this point states that the polo and service tax had\r\nnot been extended to the Chinese mestizos, who were not in existence\r\nwhen the tax was first imposed, or were but few, until a few years\r\nback, when the natives of Lingayen brought up the matter. Chinese\r\nmestizos formed the wealthiest part of many villages; and it was\r\ndecided that since they were to the natives as 1:6, they should pay\r\nsuch taxes for one month to the natives' six. At Vigan, Ilocos Sur,\r\nthe natives also presented a petition against the mestizos because\r\nnatives alone were compelled to furnish provisions, etc., to the troops\r\nin their province at the schedule price, while the mestizos escaped;\r\nand for which reason many of the natives joined the mestizo ranks,\r\nsaying that the state profited thereby because as mestizos they\r\npaid a double tribute. Governor Oraá, however, imposed a fine for\r\nsuch denaturalization. As regards the petition against the mestizos,\r\nan expediente was formed, and in July, 1841, the natives were ordered\r\nto send a salaried agent to conduct a suit against the mestizos. But\r\nthey being poor could not do so, while it was understood that the\r\nmestizos had paid a bribe of 1,000 pesos to the assessor. Consequently,\r\nit appears that notwithstanding the efforts of the alcalde-mayor and\r\nMas, nothing could be done, as the governor was so hedged in.\r\n\r\n[30] Francisco Enriquez succeeded Urrijola (who had been appointed\r\nOctober, 1820, as intendant-general of the army and treasury), in\r\nthe office of intendant in 1828, being granted more ample powers than\r\nthe latter had enjoyed. By a royal decree of October 27, 1829, it was\r\nordered that the superintendency should be held by the intendant of the\r\narmy and royal treasury, and accordingly Enriquez took such charge on\r\nSeptember 9, 1630. See Montero y Vidal, Hist. gen., ii, pp. 457, 521.\r\n\r\n[31] See José Cabezas de Herrera's Apuntes históricos sobre la\r\norganización político-administrativa de Filipinas (Manila, 1883). This\r\nis an excellent treatise on the governmental administration of the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\n[32] See the budget of receipts and expenditures in the Philippines\r\nfor the year, July, 1885-June, 1886, in Montero y Vidal's El\r\narchipiélago filipino, pp. 169-186. The expenditures involve:\r\ngeneral obligations, 1,523,335.07 pesos; state, 125,000 pesos;\r\ngrace and justice, 1,085,769.62 pesos; war, 3,494,923.31 pesos;\r\ntreasury, 1,356,031.30 pesos; navy, 2,423,518.91 pesos; government,\r\n1,267,007.43 pesos; public works (fomento), 349,322.87 pesos; total,\r\n11,624,908.51 pesos. The receipts were 11,528,178 pesos.\r\n\r\n[33] The administrative affairs of the colonies were placed in charge\r\nof the ministerio de la gobernación (ministry of the government) in\r\n1832, and were added in 1836 to the ministerio de marina (ministry\r\nof the navy), which was after that called secretaría del despacho de\r\nmarina, comercio y gobernación de ultramar (department of the navy,\r\ncommerce, and colonial government). After various other changes, the\r\nministerio de ultramar (ministry of the colonies) was established by\r\nroyal decree, May 20, 1863. The duties of the ministry are outlined\r\nas follows: to modify the organization or administrational régime\r\nof the colonies; to fix or change the annual budget of receipts and\r\nexpenditures; to dispose of the surplus products of the colonies; to\r\nadopt any rule relative to the establishment or suppression of imposts;\r\nto propose persons for the offices of governor and captain-general,\r\nintendants, and regents of the Audiencia; to grant titles, etc.,\r\nto persons in the colonies; to adopt any measure affecting the\r\nexterior regimen of the Church or the royal patronage; to decide any\r\nserious matter according to the judgment of the minister; to draw\r\nup preparatory measures of resolutions allowing expenses or advances\r\nof funds by the public treasury of the Peninsula, which resolutions\r\nbelong to the ministry of the treasury; to transmit communications of\r\nthe ministers of state, war, and navy, to the authorities of those\r\nprovinces, and the communications of the latter to the respective\r\nministers. See Dic. encic. Hisp.-Amer., xiii, pp. 131, 132.\r\n\r\n[34] In 1803 a Spanish pamphlet was published at Philadelphia,\r\nadvocating the opinion that Spain \"ought to get rid of all her colonies\r\nin America and Asia, in order to promote agriculture and industries\r\nin the Peninsula;\" it is attributed to the Marqués de Casa Irujo\r\n(Vindel, Catálogo biblioteca filipina, no. 1797).\r\n\r\n[35] Matta took possession of the above office on June 2, 1841; he\r\nhad long been connected with the affairs of the colony. In 1837 he\r\nhad drawn up a detailed report on the advantage which would result\r\nfrom introducing steamboats into the islands. (Montero y Vidal,\r\nHist. de Filipinas, ii, p. 573.)\r\n\r\n[36] Cuerpo del Resguardo: the guards employed by the treasury to look\r\nafter the customs and excise duties on the government monopolies of\r\ntobacco, wines, liquors, etc.\r\n\r\n[37] For accounts of the confraternity of San José, see Manuel\r\nSancho's Relacion expresiva de los principales acontecimientos de la\r\ntitulada Cofradía del señor San José (first published by W. E. Retana\r\nin La Política de España, no. 21, et seq.); Memoria histórica de la\r\nconducta militar y politica del Teniente General D. Marcelino Oraá\r\n(Madrid, 1851), probably written by Pedro Chamorro; and Montero y\r\nVidal, Hist. gen., iii, pp. 37-56. This confraternity was founded by\r\nApolinario de la Cruz, a Tagálog, a native of Lucban in the province\r\nof Tayabas, who was a donné in the hospital of San Juan de Dios in\r\nManila. The new confraternity soon had many adherents in the provinces\r\nof Tayabas, Laguna, and Batangas, and in the middle of 1840 began to\r\nhold meetings in Lucban, to which both sexes were admitted, and at\r\nwhich letters from Apolinario were read. The attention of the friar\r\nparish priests was directed to the confraternity, and the meeting of\r\nOctober 19, 1840 was surprised and about 243 persons out of the 500 or\r\n600 attending it, arrested. The governor of Tayabas province, however,\r\nwho regarded the matter as entirely one of ecclesiastical jurisdiction,\r\nordered the prisoners to be released. Through the representations\r\nof the parish priest of Lucban, the provincial governor finally\r\nintervened, and the adherents to the confraternity thereupon held\r\ntheir meetings secretly in Majayjay in Laguna Province. The meeting of\r\nSept. 19, 1841, at the latter place, was surprised and some arrests\r\nmade, although but few, as information of the intended raid had\r\nbeen received. The departure of the provincial governor of Tayabas,\r\nJoaquin Ortega, for Manila, was favorable to the new sect, as a native\r\nadherent or sympathizer was left in charge of the government. Through\r\nhis acquiescence, the members of the confraternity who had gathered in\r\narmed bands at the village of Bay in Laguna (where they were joined\r\nby Apolinario, who had fled from Manila), were allowed to ensconce\r\nthemselves in Igsaban, Tayabas. From thence they opened negotiations\r\nwith the government at Tayabas to be allowed to occupy that city,\r\nthe substitute governor requesting from the parish priest that they\r\nbe allowed to hold a novena in his church. Negotiations failed,\r\nand Ortega, returning on the twenty-second of October, ordered the\r\nnatives to disperse, and on their refusal attacked them the next\r\nday with a force of over three hundred men. The natives, aided by a\r\nband of Negritos who had joined them, repulsed this force and killed\r\nOrtega, and then retired to Alitao to celebrate a novena. There\r\nthey were attacked on the first of November by a force composed of\r\ntroops sent by Oraá, and those of the province of Tayabas, and after\r\na severe engagement the natives were defeated. Apolinario, who fled,\r\nwas soon captured and shot on the fourth, others of the leaders being\r\nalso arrested. Apolinario was but twenty-seven years old, and evidently\r\nworked on the superstitious nature of his countrymen, who believed that\r\nhe was immune from danger and that the rebel forces would be aided by\r\nthe direct intervention of heaven. His followers baptized him under\r\nthe name of \"The king of the Tagálogs.\" No one except pure-blooded\r\nnatives were allowed to become members of the organization, from which\r\ncircumstance the Spaniards have always professed to believe that the\r\nconfraternity was political in nature and that religious motives were\r\nmerely a blind. Some (as in Vindel's Catálogo biblioteca filipina,\r\nno. 1895) assert that the confraternity was a sort of Katipunan. It\r\nis quite probable, however, that its origin was entirely religious,\r\nbut religion mingled with superstition and fanaticism. The fact that\r\nApolinario attempted to legalize the existence of the organization\r\nthrough both ecclesiastical and government centers, which was refused\r\nin both instances, indicates that the insurrection was forced by the\r\nSpaniards, through either fear or contempt. It is highly unlikely\r\nthat the organization had at the beginning any political motive,\r\nand its attempted suppression was a mistake of the religious and\r\ncivil authorities.\r\n\r\n[38] The defeat and slaughter of the members of the confraternity of\r\nSan José angered the native soldiers from the Province of Tayabas,\r\nwho were quartered in Malate. Conspiring with some of the garrison\r\nof the fort of Santiago, also from the same province, they attacked\r\nand took that fort Jan. 20, 1843, under the leadership of two brothers\r\n(mestizos and officers of the regiment), after killing the officers on\r\nguard. The mutiny was quickly stilled by Oraá, and the commander of\r\nthe insurgents, a sergeant, Samaniego, and some of the other leaders\r\nwere shot on the twenty-second at the camp of Bagumbayang. The other\r\nnative soldiers remained loyal and aided in quelling the mutiny. See\r\nMontero y Vidal, Hist. de Filipinas, iii, pp. 58, 59, and note.\r\n\r\n[39] The Spanish government decided to aid France against England,\r\nand declared war against the latter power in June, 1779. The Spaniards\r\naided the Americans against the British in Florida and Mississippi,\r\nand in March, 1780, captured Mobile. Martin A. S. Hume says in Modern\r\nSpain (New York, 1900), p. 6: \"As Aranda himself foresaw, and set forth\r\nin a most remarkable prophecy, the aid lent by Spain to the revolt\r\nof the English North American Colonies formed a dangerous precedent\r\nfor the separation of her own colonial dominions, and promoted the\r\nestablishment of a great Anglo-Saxon republic in America, which in\r\ntime to come should oust Spain from her last foothold in the New\r\nWorld. 'This new federal republic,' wrote Aranda to Floridablanca,\r\n'is, so to speak, born a mere pigmy, and has needed the support of two\r\npowerful nations like France and Spain to win its independence. But the\r\nday will come when it will grow into a giant, a terrible Colossus. It\r\nwill then forget the benefits it has received, and think only of its\r\nown aggrandizement.'\"\r\n\r\n[40] See Mas's remarks in this connection, ante, pp. 32-34.\r\n\r\n[41] Magistrates appointed to inquire into the circumstances of a\r\nviolent death.\r\n\r\n[42] The college of San José sent out the following bishops: José\r\nCabral, bishop-elect of Nueva Cáceres; Rodrigo de la Cueva Jiron,\r\nbishop of Nueva Segovia; Francisco Pizarro de Orellana, bishop of\r\nNueva Segovia; Jeronimo de Herrera, bishop of Nueva Segovia; Felipe\r\nde Molina y Figueroa, bishop of Nueva Cáceres; Domingo de Valencia,\r\nbishop of Nueva Cáceres; José de Andaya, bishop of Ovieda, Spain,\r\nbishop-elect of Puebla de los Angeles, Mexico, and archbishop of\r\nMexico; and Ignacio de Salamanca, bishop of Cebu. The college also sent\r\nout one auditor, one royal treasurer, two alcaldes-mayor; 39 Jesuits\r\n(of whom three were martyrs), 4 provincials, 11 calced Augustinians,\r\n10 Recollects, 8 Franciscans, and 3 Dominicans. These statistics are\r\ngiven by Pablo Pastells in a letter in 1902, a translation of which\r\nis in the possession of Rev. T. C. Middleton, O.S.A.\r\n\r\n[43] Vindel says (Catálogo biblioteca filipina, no. 756) that the\r\nschool of agriculture in Manila was organized by Rafael García\r\nLópez. In regard to this school, which was founded in 1889, see\r\nVOL. XLV, pp. 314-318.\r\n\r\n[44] On May 4, 1869, a society was authorized for \"the promotion of\r\ninstruction in the arts and trades in the Filipinas Islands;\" but it\r\nwas of short duration, as schools of this sort were soon afterward\r\nestablished by the government. (Vindel, ut supra, no. 1661; see also\r\nVOL. XLV of this series.)\r\n\r\n[45] Vindel mentions (Catálogo biblioteca filipina, p. 50)\r\n\"arrangements regarding the Philippine Institute, and chairs of\r\nTagálog, Bisayan, and practical land-surveying,\" in the Boletin\r\noficial del Ministerio de Ultramar, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[46] \"There was still at Manila another caste of mestizos, originating\r\nfrom Japanese and the Indian women. These Japanese landed on the\r\nisland of Luçon, about fourscore years ago, in a dismantled vessel,\r\nand destitute of everything; I saw them in 1767. They numbered,\r\nI believe, at most sixty or seventy persons, all Christians. But as\r\nthe form of government doubtless did not please them, nor perhaps did\r\nthe Inquisition, they had demanded to return [to their own country];\r\nand all, or nearly all, actually departed in that same year, 1767,\r\nand returned to Japan, where they have probably resumed the faith of\r\ntheir fathers.\" (Le Gentil, Voyage, ii, pp. 53, 54.) Concepción states\r\n(Hist. de Philipinas, vii, p. 6) that in 1658 a number of Christian\r\nJapanese were living in the barrio of San Anton, near Manila; some of\r\nthem had come on a Japanese ship that was driven to Cavite by storms,\r\nand remained with their countrymen at Manila.\r\n\r\n[47] A list of many practical plans and regulations for the benefit of\r\nthe Philippine Islands, appearing in the Boletin oficial del Ministerio\r\nde Ultramar (Madrid, 1875-83) may be found in Vindel, ut supra, pp. 49,\r\n50. Many other lists of interesting articles regarding the islands,\r\nfound in periodical publications, are given therein, pp. 46-62;\r\nalso in Beleña's Recopilacion (p. 67).\r\n\r\n[48] Some credit should also be given to the Royal Philippine Company\r\n(Real Compañía de Filipinas), which, though unsuccessful financially,\r\nstimulated considerably the development of Philippine agriculture\r\nbetween 1790 and 1820, after which year it did little until its\r\ndissolution.\r\n\r\n[49] Comyn's Estado says that in 1810 the number of Spaniards,\r\nborn in the Peninsula or elsewhere, and of Spanish mestizos, of\r\nboth sexes and all ages, classes, and occupations, did not exceed\r\n3,500 to 4,000. Diaz Arenas (Memorías históricas y estadísticas\r\nde Filipinas; Manila, 1850) quotes official figures showing 293\r\nSpaniards settled in the provinces, outside of Manila and Tondo, in\r\n1848; and he records 7,544 as the number of Spanish mestizos in the\r\nislands, including Tondo, as Manila province was then called. Cavada\r\n(Historia geográfica, geológica y estadística de Filipinas; Manila,\r\n1876), taking his figures apparently from the governmental statistics\r\nas to houses and their occupants for 1870, gives for that year 3,823\r\nSpaniards (all but 516 of them males) from the Peninsula, and 9,710\r\n\"Filipino-Spaniards,\" the latter classification apparently including\r\nSpanish mestizos with such pure-blooded Spaniards as had been born in\r\nthe Philippines. Among his Peninsular Spaniards would be included\r\nover 1,000 members of religious orders, an approximately equal\r\nnumber of soldiers, and the civil officials of Spanish blood (except\r\na relatively small number born in the islands themselves, mostly\r\nin the minor categories of officials). J. F. del Pan (La poblacion\r\nde Filipinas; Manila, 1883), and F. Cañamaque (Las íslas Filipinas;\r\nMadrid, 1880) both report the parochial statistics of 1876 as showing\r\nthe total of Spaniards, apart from members of the religious orders,\r\nthe civil service, and the army and navy, to be 13,265; Cañamaque\r\nspeaks of this latter class as \"Spaniards without official character\r\n(Peninsulars and Filipinos),\" and Del Pan calls them \"persons not\r\nsubject to the capitation-tax on account of being of the Spanish\r\nrace.\" At least some of the Spanish mestizos in the islands would\r\nappear to have been included in this total. A statistical résumé for\r\n1898 (La Política de España en Filipinas, 1898, pp. 87-92) gives the\r\nnumber of Spaniards in the Philippines at the end of Spanish rule\r\nas 34,000 (of whom 5,800 are credited as officers and employees of\r\ngovernments, 3,800 as the normal number of Spaniards in army and navy,\r\nand 1,700 as of the clerical estate). These figures, like various other\r\nestimates in pamphlets of recent years, are considerably exaggerated;\r\nthey are reconcilable only on the supposition that they include not\r\nonly Spaniards of Philippine birth, but also Spanish mestizos. In 1903,\r\nonly 3,888 Peninsular Spaniards were found in the archipelago. The\r\ncensus of 1896 would have shown separately Spaniards and Spanish\r\nmestizos; but it was not completed for all provinces, and has never\r\nbeen published. The foregoing estimates and figures do, however,\r\nshow the great relative increase of Spaniards and Spanish influence\r\nin the Philippines in the latter part of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nApropos of Mr. LeRoy's note the following is of interest as regards\r\nthe population of the eighteenth century. \"The number of Spaniards\r\nwho are in the part of Manila not occupied by the friars is very\r\ninconsiderable; in 1767, they did not exceed eight hundred persons. It\r\ncan be said that the friars are masters of the city, for all the\r\nhouses, except perhaps five or six, belong to them. This makes a fine\r\nrevenue for them, since the houses are very dear--from two hundred to\r\nfour hundred piasters (one thousand to two thousand livres). They are\r\nstill dearer in the suburb of Santa Cruz, where they are worth at least\r\nfive hundred piasters, for it is there that all the foreign merchants\r\nfrom India or China lodge. Manila is still peopled by the Tagálogs,\r\nwho are the natives at once of this city and of its bishopric; the\r\nTagálogs serve the Spaniards as domestics, or live by some petty\r\ntrade or occupation.\" (Le Gentil, Voyage, ii, p. 104.)--Eds.\r\n\r\n[50] \"The Spanish-Filipino Bank, the oldest bank in the islands, was\r\nfounded (1852) by an order of the Spanish government uniting the obras\r\npías funds of the four orders of friars in the Philippines.\" (Census\r\nof Philippine Islands, iv, p. 541).--Eds.\r\n\r\n[51] In the tariff revision of 1891, Spanish goods in Spanish ships\r\nwere made free of customs duties in Philippine ports; prior to\r\nthat time they had, as a rule, paid one-half the duties assessed on\r\nforeign goods.\r\n\r\n[52] In 1898, for instance, when the war with the United States began,\r\nthe governor-general of the Philippines who had recently negotiated\r\na peace with the insurgent chiefs, had just turned over his place to\r\na new man, a stranger in the islands, and sailed for home. The new\r\nLiberal administration, which came into power in Spain in October,\r\n1897, had also sent to the Philippines a new set of provincial\r\ngovernors, to take the place of men who had served, in many cases,\r\nless than two years. Some of these new governors had not gone to\r\ntheir posts when Commodore Dewey's squadron arrived, and they were\r\nconsequently blockaded in Manila.\r\n\r\n[53] This was accomplished on December 31, 1882--(but see post,\r\np. 141).--Eds.\r\n\r\n[54] F. Jagor, Reisen in den Philippinen (Berlin, 1873), p. 287.\r\n\r\nAlso of interest in this connection are Jagor's remarks in the\r\nfollowing two citations from the same book (pp. 288 and 289,\r\nrespectively). \"Government monopolies mercilessly administered,\r\ngrievous disregard of the creoles and the rich mestizos, and the\r\nexample of the United States, these were the principal causes of the\r\nloss of the American possessions [of Spain]; and the same causes are\r\nmenacing the Philippines also. Of the monopolies sufficient account\r\nhas been given in the text. Mestizos and creoles are not, it is true,\r\nshut out, as formerly in America, from all offices; but they feel that\r\nthey are deeply injured and despoiled by the crowds of office seekers\r\nwhom the frequent changes of ministers at Madrid bring to Manila. Also\r\nthe influence of the American elements is at least discernible on\r\nthe horizon, and will come more to the front as the relations of\r\nthe two countries grow closer. At present these are still of little\r\nimportance; in the meantime commerce follows its old routes, which\r\nlead to England and the Atlantic ports of the Union. Nevertheless,\r\nhe who attempts to form a judgment as to the future destiny of the\r\nPhilippines cannot fix his gaze only on their relations to Spain;\r\nhe must also consider the mighty changes which within a few decades\r\nare being effected on that side of our planet. For the first time in\r\nthe world's history, the gigantic nations on both sides of a gigantic\r\nocean are beginning to come into direct intercourse: Russia, which\r\nalone is greater than two divisions of the world together; China,\r\nwhich within her narrow bounds contains a third of the human race;\r\nAmerica, with cultivable soil enough to support almost three times the\r\nentire population of the earth. Russia's future rôle in the Pacific\r\nOcean at present baffles all calculations. The intercourse of the two\r\nother powers will probably have all the more important consequences\r\nwhen the adjustment between the immeasurable necessity for human\r\nlabor-power on the one hand, and a correspondingly great surplus\r\nof that power on the other, shall fall on it as a problem.\" \"But in\r\nproportion as the commerce of the western coast of America extends\r\nthe influence of the American elements over the South Sea, the\r\nensnaring spell which the great republic exercises over the Spanish\r\ncolonies will not fail to assert itself in the Philippines also. The\r\nAmericans appear to be called upon to bring the germ planted by the\r\nSpaniards to its full development. As conquerors of the New World,\r\nrepresentatives of the body of free citizens in contradistinction to\r\nthe nobility, they follow with the axe and plow of the pioneer where\r\nthe Spaniards had opened the way with cross and sword. A considerable\r\npart of Spanish America already belongs to the United States, and has,\r\nsince that occurred, attained an importance which could not have been\r\nanticipated either during Spanish rule or during the anarchy which\r\nensued after and from it. In the long run, the Spanish system cannot\r\nprevail over the American. While the former exhausts the colonies\r\nthrough direct appropriation of them to the privileged classes, and\r\nthe metropolis through the drain of its best forces (with, besides,\r\na feeble population), America draws to itself the most energetic\r\nelements from all lands; and these on her soil, free from all\r\ntrammels, and restlessly pushing forward, are continually extending\r\nfurther her power and influence. The Philippines will so much the\r\nless escape the influence of the two great neighboring empires, since\r\nneither the islands nor their metropolis are in a condition of stable\r\nequilibrium. It seems desirable for the natives that the opinions\r\nhere expressed shall not too soon be realized as facts, for their\r\ntraining thus far has not sufficiently prepared them for success in\r\nthe contest with those restless, active, most inconsiderate peoples;\r\nthey have dreamed away their youth.\" Some writers have carried the\r\nevolution one step farther, as for instance, the following: See Count\r\nEdward Wilczek's interesting study on \"The historical importance of\r\nthe Pacific Ocean,\" in H. F. Helmolt's History of the World (N. Y.,\r\n1902), i, pp. 566-599; he predicts a future contest which \"will\r\nhave to decide whether, by the permanent occupation of the northern\r\nPacific, the white race shall accomplish its world-embracing destiny,\r\nor whether, with the goal already in sight, and for the first time\r\nin its history, it will have to make way for a stronger\"--that is,\r\nfor the yellow race, in the form of Japan and China.--Eds.\r\n\r\n[55] See the most important of these decrees in our educational\r\nappendix, VOL. XLVI.--Eds.\r\n\r\n[56] In 1899 and 1900, the American government continued the\r\nsubsidies to the Jesuits to sustain the normal school and Manila\r\nAteneo. With the establishment, however, of an educational system\r\nunder the Taft Commission, the subsidy to the Ateneo was withdrawn\r\nand a Manila public high school established. The normal school was\r\nestablished in the old buildings of the exposition of 1887, and was\r\nthe first special school organized under Dr. Atkinson. The vacation\r\nnormal school is due to Dr. Barrows, who established it in the spring\r\nvacation of 1901, in order that the teachers from the provinces might\r\nbe gathered together for brief instruction in new methods, exchange\r\nof ideas, and general inspiration. The regular normal school has\r\nbeen a very notable feature since 1901, and in some ways the most\r\nstriking thing in the new school system. Its woman's dormitory has\r\nbeen a center of Filipino gatherings and a constant theme of praise\r\nby the Filipino press. (From a previous communication to the Editors\r\nby J. A. LeRoy.) See VOL. XLVI, p. 95, note.--Eds.\r\n\r\n[57] This exchange of Mindanao missions by the Recollects for parishes\r\nin and around Manila and in Mindoro was closely connected with the\r\npro-seculars' campaign made in Manila and Madrid at that time--Father\r\nBurgos of the Cathedral standing out preëminently on behalf of\r\nhis fellows the native priests, a direct step in the way toward\r\nhis execution in connection with the Cavite mutiny of 1872.

With the three priests was also\r\nexecuted one Francisco Saldúa. Máximo Inocencio, Enrique Paraíso, and\r\nCrisanto de los Reyes were sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. Others\r\nwere also condemned to death, some of whose sentences were commuted to\r\nlife imprisonment. The following persons were deported to Marianas:\r\nAntonio María Regidor, 8 years; Máximo Paterno; Agustín Mendoza,\r\nparish priest of the district of Santa Cruz de Manila; Joaquín Pardo\r\nde Tavera, a regidor of Manila and university professor, 6 years.

The labor monograph of V. S.

Austin's Colonial administration, 1800-1900\r\n(from Summary of Commerce and Finance of the United States for March,\r\n1903).\r\n\r\n[90] The Statesman's Yearbook and such general works of reference\r\nwill merit consultation; but it should be remarked that, prior to\r\n1898, encyclopedias, annuals, etc., commonly treated the Philippines\r\nrather cursorily and not always accurately, while, generally speaking,\r\nthe Spanish colonies have had very inadequate consideration at the\r\nhands of English and American authors and editors. For the special\r\nsubjects of military and naval organization, see Salinas y Angulo's\r\nLegislación militar (Manila, 1879), and Rodriguez Trujillo's Memoria\r\nsobre la Marina (Manila, 1887), both cited in the Bibliography.\r\n\r\n[91] Published in La España Oriental, Manila, 1893, and La Política\r\nde España en Filipinas, 1893-94. See Pardo de Tavera's Biblioteca,\r\nno. 1496; note also his no. 2702, under Tiscar.\r\n\r\n[92] It is to be emphasized, however, that this abstract shows only\r\nthe framework of that government, and that just as it stood (on paper)\r\nat the beginning of 1898, its author not having traced the development\r\nof that organism even for a few years back nor learned that some of\r\nthe provisions he outlined were not really in practice.\r\n\r\n[93] Grifol y Aliaga (vol. XLVI, p. 109, note 48) is very naïve,\r\nseeking to waive away the effect of the Maura law's plain provisions\r\nin the same way as did some friar and other writers. In his decree\r\nproviding regulations for carrying out the law, Blanco explained that\r\nthe parish priests were to retain their inspection of the schools as\r\nregards the teaching of religion and morals. The municipal tribunals\r\nwere expressly created as schoolboards--an institution of which Zamora\r\n(Las corporaciones religiosas) bitterly complains. In reality, however,\r\nthis reform remained a dead letter in most villages, except in the\r\nprovinces most advanced in the propaganda, where the Filipino local\r\nofficials asserted their power of regulation (Bulakan, Batangas,\r\nManila, etc.). (From a previous communication from Mr. LeRoy.)--Eds.\r\n\r\n[94] Pedro A. Paterno's Regimen municipal de las islas Filipinas\r\n(Madrid, 1893), reproducing Minister Maura's decree in its original\r\nform, with notes, was therefore premature. Except in some of its\r\ncomments, however, this work is at least not merely ridiculous, as\r\nare this author's writings on an imaginary primitive religion and\r\ncivilization of the Filipinos. Don Pedro has a lively imagination,\r\ntoo lively for politics and history, but capable of providing good\r\nentertainment when he exercises it as a dramatist. One finds him much\r\nmore pleasing in this rôle than as a Filipino reform propagandist,\r\nthough in the latter capacity he seems to have been taken very\r\nseriously by Doctor Schurman and Mr. Foreman, and by various Spanish\r\nofficials before them, including, for a time, Governor-Generals Primo\r\nde Rivera and Augustín.\r\n\r\n[95] Once more, the Manila press since 1898 merits attention here. The\r\nFilipino press has not been always fair in treating of the old régime,\r\nbut both in the Filipino and the Spanish press of Manila since 1898\r\nsome things have been brought to light which were either suppressed\r\nfor private gossip or not frankly discussed at the time of their\r\nconference.\r\n\r\n[96] Notes from his Progreso de Filipinas: Lack of public improvements\r\nand defects of public services, especially education, pp. 26-34;\r\ndefects in administration of justice and its expensiveness,\r\npp. 134-136; lack of development of material resources, pp. 205-211,\r\n253-254; restriction of opportunities for Filipino laborers, and the\r\nevils of caciquism, pp. 212-237. A study of caciquism (subjection\r\nof the masses) and its deep roots in Philippine social, economic,\r\nand political conditions may be found in J. A. LeRoy's Philippine\r\nLife in Town and Country (New York, 1905), chap. vi; also the same\r\nin part by the same author in the Atlantic Monthly for March, 1905.\r\n\r\n[97] Though unsupported evidence here given, particularly when\r\nobviously gossip or when coming from partisan witnesses, is to\r\nbe accepted with caution. F. H. Sawyer's reminiscences of the\r\nadministrations of various governor-generals are subject to the same\r\ncaution, except where the author plainly speaks from a personal\r\nknowledge of the facts; nevertheless, that such opinions on the\r\nhighest officials of the islands could pass current even as gossip\r\namong Spaniards and foreigners in Manila is in itself alone very\r\nsignificant of the tone of public life in the islands. Note Sawyer\r\nalso on the administration of justice, and Foreman on the \"pickings\"\r\nof officials in the provinces.\r\n\r\n[98] Note especially Military Governor of the Philippine Islands on\r\nCivil Affairs (Report War Dept., 1900, i, part 10), pp. 8-13, 79 et\r\nseq. See also, for defects and corruption in the customs administration\r\nup to 1881, Sancianco y Goson, pp. 36-37, 125-131.\r\n\r\n[99] Part of this money was spent in campaigns against the Moros,\r\nand perhaps for other purposes not covered by the budget of ordinary\r\nexpenses. See La Política de España en Filipinas, v, no. 116,\r\nfor an account of progress in this work up to 1895. The press of\r\nManila has published during the past few years various articles on\r\nthe funds collected by subscription in Spain and the Philippines\r\nfor the relief of the sufferers from the earthquake in Manila in\r\n1863. See particularly El Renacimiento, Manila, September 18, 1906,\r\nfor a report on the subject by Attorney-General Araneta. It would\r\nthere appear that nearly $450,000 were collected; by 1870, only some\r\n$30,000 had been distributed to the sufferers themselves; whether they\r\nreceived further shares at a later date does not appear, but $80,000\r\nwere loaned from this fund to the obras pías in 1880, and about\r\n$15,000 were used for cholera relief in 1888-89. Governor-General\r\nIde instructed the attorney-general to demand the return of the\r\n$80,000 from the obras pías, and recommended that, when $50,000 of\r\nthis fund had been recovered, distribution of it among those who\r\nsuffered losses in 1863 should begin--almost a half-century later,\r\nand under another government!\r\n\r\n[100] The new industrial (or income) taxes had, however,\r\nbeen inaugurated before he wrote. See his Progreso de Filipinas,\r\npp. vii, 81-87, 93-94, on this subject; pp. 5-15, for extracts from\r\na project of economic reforms in 1870 (which see, in the Biblioteca,\r\nno. 2041); pp. 9, 10, 28-34, 48-53, 56, 65-80, 81-89, arguments\r\nfor a real-property tax; pp. 6-10, 100-124, 142-143, the tribute;\r\npp. 133-143, miscellaneous taxes; pp. 142-143, local taxes proper.\r\n\r\n[101] Dr. Schurman drew from Spanish official publications the budget\r\nof 1894-95 for his exposition of the former Philippine government\r\n(Report of Philippine Commission, 1900, i, pp. 79-81), and this has\r\nbeen considerably quoted, with the assumption that it represented\r\nthe full cost of government, in recent comparisons with the American\r\nrégime. Sawyer (in an appendix) gives the budget of 1896-97, with just\r\na note showing that charges for collection and for local government\r\nmade the actual collections for the poll-tax considerably larger than\r\nthe insular budget showed. Foreman, in his 1899 and 1906 editions,\r\nonly reproduces from his first edition a fragmentary statement of the\r\n1888 budget, without showing that this was only partial and without\r\ndeveloping the later changes and increases in taxes. Retana, in the\r\nEstadismo, apéndice H, under Rentas é impuestos del Estado, gives the\r\ngeneral totals of the budgets of 1890 and 1893-94 (likewise net totals\r\nfor the central government alone). See Sancianco y Goson for proposed\r\nbudget for 1881-82. The insular budget was published annually at Madrid\r\nunder the title Presupuestos generales de gastos é ingresos de las\r\nislas Filipinas. The budget was made up at Madrid for each fiscal year,\r\nand put into effect by a royal decree (after its receipt in Manila,\r\nsome few months after the beginning of the fiscal year which it was\r\nto govern). Some changes or additions were allowed to be made by the\r\ngovernor-general in imperative circumstances; otherwise the effort was\r\nto regulate Philippine finances just the same as if the islands were\r\na province of the centralized government of the Peninsula itself. The\r\nfolio volume of Presupuestos published at Madrid, running to several\r\nhundred pages, are valuable for giving in minute detail the expected\r\nitems of expenditures, down to the last petty employee on salary; but\r\nthey can give, of course, only the estimate of the revenue expected\r\nunder each item, and actual collections sometimes varied considerably\r\nfrom these figures. Above all, these Presupuestos bear out the general\r\nremark that the Spanish budget as published tends to conceal rather\r\nthan to reveal the actual burden resting on the people. They are not\r\nbudgets for the insular government alone, hence the budgets for the\r\ncity of Manila and for the local governments (provinces and towns),\r\npublished separately in some years at Manila, must be consulted to get\r\ntotal net collections for all branches of government. In addition, one\r\nmust dig out for himself from the laws governing taxation, etc., and\r\nfrom the archives the data regarding fees for collection, notarial,\r\nlegal and other fees accruing to private pockets, surcharges for\r\nspecial purposes, etc.\r\n\r\n[102] The subject can not be thoroughly discussed here. For some\r\ndata and references thereon, see contributions by the writer\r\nto the Political Science Quarterly, xxi, pp. 309-311, and xxii,\r\npp. 124-125. Regarding ecclesiastical dues and exactions, the share\r\nof the ecclesiastical establishment in local revenues, etc., see,\r\nbesides citations there given, M. H. del Pilar's La soberanía monacal\r\nen Filipinas (Barcelona, 1888, and Manila, 1898).\r\n\r\nThe above contributions cited by Mr. LeRoy are his criticism of\r\nH. Parker Willis's Our Philippine Problem (New York, 1905), and his\r\nRejoinder to Mr. Willis's Reply to that criticism (March, 1907). See\r\nalso Mr. Willis's remarks on this matter in his Reply (pp. 116-119),\r\nwhich have been fully met in Mr. LeRoy's Rejoinder.--Eds.\r\n\r\n[103] In confirmation of the first statement above, and for details\r\nregarding this debt, see Senate Document no. 62, 55th Congress,\r\n3rd session, protocols 11, 12, 15, and 16; ibid., p. 412 (Greene's\r\nmemorandum); Senate Document no. 148, 56th Congress, 2nd session, for\r\ncablegrams between the President and the American peace commissioners\r\nfrom October 27, 1898, on, especially p. 44 (details of this loan);\r\nalso Sastrón's La insurrección en Filipinas (Madrid, 1901), pp. 284,\r\n285.\r\n\r\n[104] Special attention may be directed to Clifford Stevens Walton's\r\nThe Civil Law in Spain and Spanish-America, including Cuba, Puerto\r\nRico and the Philippines (Washington, 1900).\r\n\r\n[105] Pardo de Tavera's Biblioteca, no. 1770.\r\n\r\n[106] Data obtained from Justices Arellano and Torres cover very well\r\nthe judicial organization of recent years. For earlier years, it is\r\noften in error, the Washington editor having tried to improve the\r\nmanuscript with data drawn from various sources and presented without\r\na real understanding of the legal, judicial, and administrative system\r\nof Spain and the Spanish colonies.\r\n\r\n[107] See especially Bulletin no. 22 of the Bureau of Government\r\nLaboratories (Manila, 1905), for a catalogue of the new scientific\r\nlibrary in Manila.\r\n\r\n[108] It may be said, however, that the real foundations of that\r\nscience are only now being laid in the Philippines. Most of the Spanish\r\nwritings in this line are, speaking strictly from the scientific\r\npoint of view, unreliable or, in some cases, worthless. Blumentritt,\r\nwho has written most voluminously on this subject, was never in the\r\nPhilippines, but drew largely from these Spanish sources, and he has\r\nconfused the subject rather than shed light upon it. The German and\r\nFrench scientists who visited the islands were, in most instances,\r\nnot primarily ethnologists, and have done but fragmentary work in\r\nthis field. Needless to say, all these sources must be consulted,\r\nespecially for the historical side of the subject; but the science\r\nof Philippine ethnology proper is still in its infancy.\r\n\r\n[109] Especially in the appendix of VOL. XLI.--Eds.\r\n\r\n[110] Appendix vii to report of Major-General G. W. Davis, commanding\r\nthe division of the Philippines (Rept. War Dept., 1903, iii,\r\npp. 379-398).\r\n\r\n[111] La Política de España en Filipinas reproduces Retana's eulogy\r\nof Weyler (Retana was made a deputy for Cuba in the Cortes during the\r\nWeyler régime in Cuba) and occasional articles on the Blanco campaign\r\nin the Lake Lanao region, among which note (vi, p. 18) Blanco's letter\r\nof Oct. 19, 1895, describing the beginning of a railroad and other\r\nwork around the lake. Ibid., vii, p. 170, has the protocol of April\r\n1, 1907, whereby Germany and Great Britain accept a modification of\r\nthe Sulu archipelago protocol of 1885, permitting the prohibition by\r\nSpain of traffic with Joló in arms or alcoholic liquors. The projects\r\nto colonize Mindanao put forward in connection with the Lanao campaign\r\nhave been mentioned.\r\n\r\n[112] The reports are in the annual Report of the Philippine\r\nCommission. Among the special publications, note Jenks's The Bontoc\r\nIgorot (Manila, 1905), chap. ii, for some notes on Spanish relations\r\nwith the Igorots.\r\n\r\n[113] Its columns could also be used to further personal interests, as\r\nalready shown in the case of Weyler. Retana has since 1898 executed a\r\n\"right-about-face,\" as has been best shown in his recent biographical\r\nstudy of Rizal. Herein, in various editorial notes in vol. v of the\r\nArchivo (1905), and in various letters to the Filipino press of Manila,\r\nhe has many times virtually apologized for his political writings\r\nup to 1898, has declared that he was always a \"Liberal\" at heart,\r\nand has thus written an impugnation of his own writings in behalf\r\nof friar-rule. In a letter to I. de los Reyes (reproduced from El\r\nGrito del Pueblo of Manila in El Renacimiento, Manila, July 24, 1906),\r\nRetana carries this note to the point of practically abject retraction,\r\nsaying he never has been really a Catholic, never confessed since his\r\nmarriage, etc., and referring to Rizal (whom he bitterly reviled from\r\n1892 to 1898) as a \"saint,\" etc. Regarding Retana and Blumentritt,\r\nsee also a letter by J. A. LeRoy in the Springfield Republican for\r\nJuly 7, 1906.\r\n\r\nIn this connection see Retana's opening paragraphs in his Vida y\r\nescritos del Dr. José Rizal, in Nuestro Tiempo for 1904-06.--EDS.\r\n\r\n[114] This work furnished almost the sole basis for the discussion\r\nof the work of the friars by Stephen Bonsal in the North American\r\nReview of Oct., 1902; but Mr. Bonsal, whose article is thus entirely\r\none-sided, did not state the source of his information. More than\r\nthis, Mr. Bonsal has, in translating, made even stronger some of the\r\nextreme claims of Friar Zamora. The latter (pp. 483-498) cites praise\r\nfor the friars from various governors-general: Gándara (1866), De\r\nla Torre (1871), Moriones (1877), Weyler (1891), and Primo de Rivera\r\n(1898). It is to be hoped he has not garbled them all as he did the\r\nstatement of Primo de Rivera, omitting its most significant expressions\r\nof opinion and exactly reversing its import. Moreover, Mr. Bonsal,\r\nin translating these passages from Zamora, thought it best to leave\r\nout, for his American readers, the statement by Weyler. Much the same\r\nground as covered by the claims of Zamora is traversed, with citations,\r\nby J. A. LeRoy in the Political Science Quarterly for December, 1903\r\n(also in the same author's Philippine Life, chaps. v and vii). See\r\nalso, in re extreme claims for the friars that they brought about\r\nall the internal development, settlement of towns, development of\r\nagriculture, etc., Sancianco y Goson, El progreso de Filipinas,\r\npp. 212-223, official data as to agriculture and lands by provinces\r\nin 1862, at the beginning of the modern era of trade and industry.\r\n\r\n[115] The official correspondence in the negotiations of Governor\r\nTaft with the Vatican, above cited, may also be mentioned here as\r\ndiscussing the question of recognition of the native clergy in the\r\nPhilippines, and, in general, the status which the friars came to\r\nhave there. Many loose assertions made with regard to the friars'\r\ntitles to the Philippines will be corrected by a perusal of the legal\r\nreport on their titles cited above.\r\n\r\n[116] The political phase of the attack on the friars' privileges\r\nwhich rapidly developed, especially in view of the events of 1868, are\r\ndiscussed from the friars' side in the pamphlet Apuntes interesantes\r\n(1870), condemned by Pardo de Tavera (no. 91) and ascribed to\r\nBarrantes. Retana (Estadismo, ii, p. 135*) praises the work and\r\nascribes it to Friar Casimiro Herrero. A general argument against the\r\nfriars in those times is that of Manrique Alonso Lallave, Los frailes\r\nen Filipinas (Madrid, 1872), parts of which were reproduced in El\r\nprogreso, Manila, August 8-11, 1901. His figures on friar revenues,\r\netc., are grossly exaggerated. He was an excloistered Dominican,\r\nlater turned Protestant in Spain, and went to the Philippines as a\r\nProtestant missionary in 1890, being poisoned in Manila, according\r\nto V. Diaz Perez (Los frailes de Filipinas, Madrid, 1904, p. 10).\r\n\r\n[117] See the Biblioteca, nos. 2,000 and 2,001. Both put forward the\r\nclaims of the Filipinos on grounds of ecclesiastical rule and practice\r\n(the Council of Trent particularly), but it is to be feared that the\r\nauthor's judgment on matters of authority purely ecclesiastical is\r\nsometimes warped by political or personal feeling. The same author's\r\nMi último grito de alarma (Bigan [Luzon], 1903) is an answer to\r\nConstitución apostólica Quae mare sinico (Manila, 1903), which is\r\na defense of the Pope's Philippine bull of 1903 by Presbyter Manuel\r\nE. Roxas, a Filipino priest. Father Pons also had a part in Impugnación\r\nde la censura impuesta ... al Presbítero Adriano García (Manila, 1900),\r\na notable case which much aroused the Filipino clergy in Chapelle's\r\ntime. Here and in Defensa del clero filipino are references to the\r\ntorturing of native priests by the friars at Bigan in 1896, to make\r\nthem confess complicity in a supposed plot for revolt in Ilokos.\r\n\r\n[118] Biblioteca, no. 1689. Note also no. 1675.\r\n\r\n[119] For the latter, consult especially La Iglesia Filipina\r\nIndependiente, organ of the schism, which was published in some sixty\r\nnumbers between October 11, 1903, and early in 1905; also the recent\r\npamphlet Documentos interesantes de la Iglesia Filipina Independiente\r\n(Manila, 1906). The history of the religious question under the Malolos\r\ngovernment and guerrilla warfare, and especially of Aglipay's part in\r\nit, has yet to be written from the documents (at least, unless those\r\nwho participated are more frank in future than in past statements).\r\n\r\n[120] See for citations and statements (in part conflicting), about\r\nthe deportees of 1872, Montero y Vidal, Historia, iii, p. 591 and\r\nfootnote; Pardo de Tavera's Biblioteca, nos. 1462 and 1463; and\r\nnotes by Felipe G. Calderón in supplements to El Renacimiento for\r\nAug. 11 and 18, Sept. 1 and 18, 1906. Several Filipino priests were\r\nalso deported with these civilians, who were, as has been noted in\r\nour introduction, for the most part of Spanish, not of Malay, blood,\r\nthough of Philippine birth.\r\n\r\n[121] Note especially Rizal's introduction to his novel El\r\nFilibusterismo, as showing Filipino opinion on the matter. A story\r\ncirculated among the people to the effect that the friars brought\r\nfrom Sambales province a native who looked like Father Gomez and who\r\nimpersonated the latter in order to implicate him in the mutiny at\r\nthe Cavite arsenal, with similar details, is related in an \"Appeal\r\nfor Intervention\" presented by certain Filipinos in Hongkong to the\r\nConsul-General of the United States at that place in Jan., 1897. This\r\ndocument, by the way, has never received notice in the United States\r\nso far as known to the writer, who has a manuscript copy of it.\r\n\r\nRizal dedicated his novel El filibusterismo to the three priests\r\nexecuted in consequence of the Cavite uprising of 1872. That dedication\r\nis as follows: \"The Church, by refusing to degrade you, has placed\r\nin doubt the crime that has been imputed to you; the Government, by\r\nsurrounding your trials with mystery and shadows, causes the belief\r\nthat there was some error, committed in fatal moments; and all the\r\nPhilippines, by worshiping your memory and calling you martyrs,\r\nin no sense recognize your culpability. In so far, therefore, as\r\nyour complicity in the Cavite mutiny is not clearly proved, as you\r\nmay or may not have been patriots, and as you may or may not have\r\ncherished sentiments for justice and for liberty, I have the right\r\nto dedicate my work to you as victims of the evil which I undertake\r\nto combat. And while we wait expectantly upon Spain some day to\r\nrestore your good name and cease to be answerable for your death,\r\nlet these pages serve as a tardy wreath of dried leaves over your\r\nunknown tombs, and let it be understood that every one who without\r\nclear proofs attacks your memory stains his hands in your blood!\" See\r\nJ. A. LeRoy's Philippine Life, pp. 149, 150.--Eds.\r\n\r\n[122] No real attempt to sift the evidence in the case is known to\r\nthe writer. Montero y Vidal, Historia, iii, chap. xxvii (also read\r\nthe three preceding chapters), gives the version of one side, with\r\nprincipal citations. Cf. Pardo de Tavera's Biblioteca under these\r\nnames, and see his version in Census of the Philippine Islands,\r\ni, pp. 575-579. His Reseña histórica de Filipinas suffered some\r\nalterations as published in the Spanish edition of the Census, and\r\nwas separately printed at Manila in 1906, drawing forth a series\r\nof articles in the Dominican periodical Libertas (by Friar Tamayo),\r\nwhich also appeared in pamphlet form (Sobre una \"Reseña histórica de\r\nFilipinas,\" Manila, 1906). As regards the 1872 affair, Friar Tamayo\r\nhas drawn almost entirely from Montero y Vidal.\r\n\r\n[123] As, for example, when José Rizal, yet a mere youth, scandalized\r\nthe friar and \"patriotic\" Spaniards in Manila by presenting verses\r\nfor a school celebration in Manila on \"Mi patria\" (\"My fatherland\").\r\n\r\n[124] Rizal himself returned from Europe to the Orient in 1887,\r\nand visited his home, but was persuaded by parents and friends to go\r\nabroad again. He is said to have edited various circulars which were\r\nsent from Hongkong and distributed in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n[125] Marcelo del Pilar's pamphlet La soberanía monacal en Filipinas\r\n(Barcelona, 1888; reprinted at Manila, 1898) was written with especial\r\nreference to these incidents, documents regarding which are given as\r\nappendices. Retana analyzed the 1888 petition against the friars,\r\nand discussed its signers, in his pamphlet Avisos y profecías\r\n(Madrid, 1892), pp. 286-308. See also Pardo de Tavera's Biblioteca,\r\nnos. 1597-1599 and 2807, the latter being a separate print of\r\nthe petition to the Queen, which appears in Del Pilar's pamphlet,\r\nappendix ix. The reply of the petitioners to the accusation that they\r\nreally covered separatist aims under their attacks on friar-rule is\r\nworth quoting:\r\n\r\n\"The aspiration for separation is contrary, Señora, to the interests\r\nof the Filipinos. The topographical situation of the country, divided\r\ninto numerous islands, and the diversity of its regional dialects\r\ndemand the fortifying aid of a bond of union such as the ensign of\r\nSpain accords; without such a bond, it would be daily exposed to a\r\nbreaking-up process hostile to its repose, and the very conditions of\r\nexuberant fertility that its fields, mines, and virgin forests afford\r\nwould offer a powerful incentive to draw upon it international strife\r\nto the injury of its own future.\"\r\n\r\n[126] Becerra, as minister for the colonies, met in social reunions\r\nwith the Filipino circle of Madrid, and presented in the Cortes\r\nprojects for \"assimilation,\" religious liberty, and the secularization\r\nof education in the colonies and partial municipal reforms for the\r\nPhilippines which were the forerunners of the \"Maura law.\"\r\n\r\n[127] Friar Tamayo, in his reply to statements by Pardo de Tavera,\r\npoints out that Weyler's action was in consequence of decrees of the\r\ncourts (Sobre una \"Reseña histórica de Filipinas,\" pp. 194-195). This\r\nKalamba episode seems to have had a connection with the royal order of\r\nDecember 4, 1890 (under the new Conservative ministry) empowering the\r\nreligious orders to dispose of their estates without intervention of\r\nthe Crown, as had been provided by royal orders of 1834 and 1849. The\r\nfriars had begun to make transfers to private corporations (really\r\nonly fictitious \"holding companies\") before 1898.\r\n\r\n[128] One finds guarded references to his enemies among the Filipinos\r\nthemselves in some of Rizal's private letters. The part played during\r\nthe propaganda by hints of treachery in camp, also of dishonesty\r\nin the use of the funds raised by subscription in the Philippines,\r\nis alluded to in various of the writings to be cited further on.\r\n\r\n[129] Mariano Ponce (El Renacimiento, Manila, Dec. 29, 1906) tells of\r\nan earlier periodical of propaganda, España en Filipinas, started at\r\nBarcelona in 1887, Lopez Jaena being one of its board of editors. In\r\nthis connection may be mentioned Ang Kalayaan (\"Liberty\") organ of\r\nthe Katipunan, which published one number (perhaps two) in Tagálog\r\nat the beginning of 1896, ostensibly in Yokohama, but really on a\r\nsecret press at Manila. Data about it, and a translation of some\r\nof its contents into Spanish may be found in Retana's Archivo, iv,\r\nDocumentos políticos de actualidad, no. 15. Of Gracíano Lopez Jaena\r\nmay also be noted the pamphlet Discursos y artículos varios (Barcelona,\r\n1891). He died in Spain in 1895.\r\n\r\n[130] Epifanio de los Santos (one of the propagandists, now an\r\nofficial under the Philippine government) is publishing a biography\r\nand bibliography of M. H. del Pilar, reproducing documents and letters\r\nin Plaridel (pseudonym of Del Pilar), a weekly started at Bulakan,\r\nLuzon, Jan. 1, 1907. Besides La Solidaridad and La soberanía monacal,\r\nthe writings of Del Pilar most deserving mention are the pamphlets La\r\nfrailocracía filipina (Barcelona, 1889), and Los frailes en Filipinas\r\n(Barcelona, 1889), by \"Padpiuh.\"\r\n\r\n[131] The two alleged translations published in the United States\r\nunder altered titles, do not merit even a mention; one is a garbled\r\nand partial translation from the Spanish, the other an \"adaptation\"\r\nfrom a French version of the original, boiled down to give the \"story\"\r\nand thus shorn of the very descriptive passages and delicious bits\r\nof satire which make the work notable, not as a novel, but as an\r\nexposition.\r\n\r\n[132] The various Spanish reprints (also a French one) of these novels\r\nmay be found cited in Retana's recent work, mentioned below. The best\r\nto date, but no longer easily attainable, are editions of both novels\r\nprinted at Manila in 1900 by Chofre & Cia.\r\n\r\n[133] There must also be seen the collections Documentos políticos de\r\nactualidad in Retana's Archivo, iii and iv, especially those in the\r\nlatter volume connected with Rizal's trial and execution. Besides\r\nthe documents there reproduced--the diary of Rizal as a student in\r\nMadrid (now in the library of Edward E. Ayer, of Chicago), notes and\r\ndocuments furnished to Retana by various friends and coworkers of\r\nRizal (especially by Epifanio de los Santos)--use has been made in\r\nRetana's latest work of data published in the Filipino press from 1898\r\nto date, particularly in the special numbers which appear annually\r\nin connection with the anniversaries of Rizal's execution (December\r\n30). Among these may be named especially: La Independencia, Sept. 25,\r\n1898, and Jan. 2, 1899 (Rizal's letters to Blumentritt regarding his\r\nrelations with Blanco and recall to Manila for trial; also quoted by\r\nForeman); La Patria, Dec. 30, 1899; La Democracia, Homenaje á Rizal,\r\nseparately printed at Manila, 1899, with seventeen Rizal articles,\r\nsixteen reproduced from La Solidaridad; La Democracia, Dec. 29,\r\n30 or 31, 1901-06, especially Dec. 29, 1905 (notes by Santos); El\r\nRenacimiento, same dates; ibid., April 28, 1906 (notes by Retana);\r\nibid., May 26, June 2, and Dec. 29, 1906 (notes by Mariano Ponce);\r\nibid., Sept. 22, 1906 (notes by Edouardo Late); La Independencia,\r\nSept. 12, 14, 17, and 18, 1906 (Rizal's correspondence from his\r\nplace of exile at Dapitan with Father Pastells, the Jesuit superior,\r\nregarding his religious belief, and incidentally his loyalty to Spain).\r\n\r\nSee also La Juventud (Barcelona), El Doctor Rizal y su obra, published\r\nin 1897.--Eds.\r\n\r\n[134] Morga, who gave a more truly scientific and in many respects\r\nmore favorable view of the Filipinos at the time of the conquest than\r\nthe later friar-chroniclers, had been neglected by Spanish writers\r\nand students, and Rizal's purpose in bringing out the Sucesos was\r\nprimarily to correct many recent exaggerations in the literature\r\nabout the Filipinos. The bitterness with which his work (and even\r\nMorga himself) was assailed revealed the political spirit of the times.\r\n\r\n[135] Filipinas dextro de cien años, in La Solidaridad, reprinted in\r\nRetana's Archivo, v.\r\n\r\n[136] Library of Congress List, pp. 99, 100; and Pardo de Tavera's\r\nBiblioteca, nos. 307, 308, 339 and 341 (also 1087).\r\n\r\n[137] As also their tendency to assume that every Spanish official\r\nwho favored a more liberal political régime in the Philippines\r\ndid so because he was a Mason. The books of Sastrón and Castillo y\r\nJimenez (especially pp. 372-376, 382), also the friar pamphlets of\r\nGarcía-Barzanallana (Library of Congress List, p. 103) and Navarro\r\n(Biblioteca, no. 1,811), are especially in point. See, for accounts\r\nfrom the same point of view, the report of the Spanish officer of\r\nthe civil guard, Olegario Diaz, no. 77 of Documentos políticos in\r\nthe Archivo, iii, and other documents in that series in vols. iii,\r\nand iv. Masones y ultramontanes, by Juan Utor y Fernandez (Manila,\r\n1899), is a defense of Masonry by a Spaniard who founded lodges in the\r\nPhilippines. V. Diaz Perez in the pamphlet Los frailes de Filipinas\r\nbrings out from the same point of view some figures and other data\r\non Masonry in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n[138] In his Memoria al Senado (Madrid, 1897), pp. 158-163.\r\n\r\n[139] See Biblioteca, no. 2,665.\r\n\r\n[140] Cited in their original draft, somewhat skeletonized, in the\r\nnotes furnished for Retana's Vida y escritos de José Rizal by E. de\r\nlos Santos, and by the latter also furnished in a manuscript copy to\r\nthe writer (of which see the translation post, pp. 217-226).\r\n\r\n[141] Notes, etc., in El Renacimiento, Manila, Aug. 11 and 18,\r\nSept. 1 and 18, Oct. 13, 1906.\r\n\r\n[142] This is especially true of the documents given by José M. del\r\nCastillo y Jimenez, El Katipunan ó el Filibusterismo en Filipinas\r\n(Madrid, 1897), pp. 114-117, 118-123, whence they have been quoted\r\nby various other writers. It is to be noted, first, that the source\r\nof these documents has never been given; they are not among the\r\nextracts from the official records of the courts-martial reproduced\r\nin Retana's Archivo, iii, and iv; and, finally, certain passages in\r\nthem read suspiciously as if prepared for the purpose of proving the\r\nmost exaggerated statements about the Katipunan and of magnifying\r\nthe scope and aims of the whole movement.\r\n\r\n[143] See on this subject an article by J. A. LeRoy, Japan and the\r\nPhilippine Islands, in Atlantic Monthly, January, 1906. Primo de\r\nRivera, in his Memoria (1898), several times declares that the Cavite\r\ninsurgents of 1896-97 never had more than 1,500 firearms, including\r\nrifles of all sorts, shotguns, and revolvers.\r\n\r\n[144] This was allowed to appear even in the testimony as written\r\ndown by the Spanish military court (Retana's Archivo, iii, Documentos\r\npolíticos, nos. 35, 46, and 55).\r\n\r\n[145] Besides Castillo y Jimenez, the Katipunan will be found discussed\r\nin nearly all the sources to be cited on the 1896-97 insurrection. Data\r\non Bonifacio are scanty, but see El Renacimiento, April 23, 1903;\r\nibid., for the notes of Calderón, above cited, and of Aug. 30, 1906,\r\nfor a letter by Pio Valenzuela; also comments by A. Mabini and notes\r\nby J. A. LeRoy in American Historical Review, xi, pp. 843-861. A\r\npamphlet, The Katipunan (Manila, 1902), by Francis St. Clair (?),\r\npublished in order to put before Americans the friar view of the\r\nFilipino revolutionists, contains an English version of the report\r\nof Olegario Diaz, cited above; its notes, drawn indiscriminately from\r\nRetana, Castillo y Jimenez, and others, are full of errors.\r\n\r\n[146] Friar Zamora (Las corporaciones religiosas en Filipinas,\r\npp. 334-325) says the forces of the Civil Guard sent to the Bisayas\r\nwere recruited not from the best men in the Filipino infantry\r\nregiments, as the Governor-General ordered, but from the worst,\r\nbecause these were the men whom the infantry colonels would let go. \"We\r\nparish-priests knew this, because the Civil Guard officers themselves\r\nso told us; we saw, a few days after the posts were established\r\nin the towns, that the majority of the Guards ought to be serving,\r\nnot in that corps of prestige, but in some disciplinary corps or in\r\nthe penitentiary. Nevertheless, from our pulpits we recommended and\r\neulogized what caused us disgust and displeasure, because it was so\r\nordered by the Governor-General to the provincial of the monastic\r\norders, and directly to the parish-priests themselves through the\r\nmedium of the governors of provinces.\"\r\n\r\n[147] Joaquin Pellicena y Lopez, a Spanish journalist of Manila,\r\nan admirer of the Jesuits (in some degree, perhaps, an exponent of\r\nJesuit views on recent years in the Philippines), in the pamphlet Los\r\nfrailes y los filipinos (Manila, Jan., 1901), defends the work of\r\nthe friars as a historical whole, but condemns their unwillingness\r\nto progress with the times. As one proof that the rebellion of 1896\r\nwas against the friars, not against Spain, he says (pp. 27-28) that\r\nGovernor-General Polavieja's demand for 25,000 fresh troops in April,\r\n1897, was, only a pretext to cover his resignation. Polavieja, who came\r\nout to succeed Blanco and under whom Rizal was almost immediately\r\nexecuted, had suddenly become convinced, says this journalist,\r\nby reading correspondence of Aguinaldo with the Jesuit superior,\r\nthat the real cause of the trouble was the friars. As virtually\r\nemissary and appointee of the friars, the inference is, Polavieja\r\nconcluded it would be impossible for him to settle the difficulties\r\nsuccessfully. The letters of Aguinaldo to Pio Pí are most interesting,\r\nat least (See La Politica de España en Filipinas, vii, pp. 326-328).\r\n\r\n[148] Notably the \"removal\" of Andrés Bonifacio in 1897 (regarding\r\nwhich the Bonifacio note above cites incomplete data), and the\r\nBiak-na-bató negotiation, treated below.\r\n\r\n[149] Memoria que al Senado dirige el General Blanco acerca de los\r\núltimos sucesos ocurridos en la isla de Luzón (Madrid, 1897).\r\n\r\n[150] Ibid., pp. 64-68, 163-169. The real Blanco expresses himself in\r\nthese sentences: \"For some people, proof of character and energy is\r\ngiven by ordering executions right and left, at the pleasure of the\r\npublic, which is wont to be excited by passion; but, on the contrary,\r\nenergy is shown by resisting all kinds of abuses, and this one most of\r\nall. To shoot men is very easy; the difficult thing is not to do it.\"\r\n\r\n[151] See also Senate Document no. 62 for hearsay testimony by\r\nforeigners at Paris regarding the \"reign of terror,\" tortures, etc.;\r\nand the books of Foreman and Sawyer for similar testimony.\r\n\r\n[152] It is to be noted that some of the worst stories of Filipino\r\noutrages upon Spanish captives, especially friars, later proved\r\nto be rumors, or were exaggerated, though some brutalities were\r\ncommitted. See La Democracia, Manila, July 12, 1906, for an alleged\r\nconfession by Friar Piernavieja (extorted from him, and dictated to him\r\nin bad Spanish); ibid., July 14, 1906, for data regarding the execution\r\nof him and two other friars in Cavite, in \"reprisal\" for the execution\r\nof Rizal. Isabelo de los Reyes's pamphlet La religión del Katipunan\r\n(Madrid, 1900), as also other writings in Filipinas ante Europa and\r\nEl defensor de Filipinas, a periodical edited at Madrid, 1899-1901 by\r\nReyes, may be mentioned here, as to Aguinaldo and the revolutionary\r\nmovement in general; statements therein are commonly unreliable.\r\n\r\n[153] A few are in the List of the Library of Congress, under Political\r\nand Social Economy, and American Occupation, 1898-1903. Some may be\r\nfound under the authors' names in Pardo de Tavera's Biblioteca.\r\n\r\n[154] So also La soberanía nacional, by D. Paradada, a Jesuit\r\n(Barcelona, 1897), cited by Pardo de Tavera, as \"stupid.\" In this\r\nconnection may be cited the following titles of Spanish writings\r\non the events following May, 1898, which contain some backward\r\nglances upon the earlier phases of the Filipino revolution, also\r\nsome Spanish imprevision; Juan y José Toral.--El sitio de Manila\r\n(Manila, 1898).

Fernando\r\nPrimo de Rivera y Sobremonte acerca de sa gestión en Filipinas. Agosto\r\nde 1898 (Madrid, 1898). Pp. 121-158 cover the Biak-na-bató negotiation.\r\n\r\n[157] E.g., In his Reseña verídica (only signed, not written by him),\r\nan English translation of which appears in Congressional Record,\r\nxxxv, appendix, pp. 440-445.\r\n\r\n[158] See Congressional Record, xxxv, part 6, pp. 6092-94, for English\r\ntranslations with explanatory notes. See also Senate Document no. 208,\r\n56th Congress, 1st session, part 2, for the documents showing the\r\ndiscussion of the junta of Filipinos at Hongkong in February and May,\r\n1898, relative to the Biak-na-bató money payments and the obligations\r\nthereby contracted toward the Spanish government. When the Philippine\r\nInsurgent Records now in manuscript in the War Department, edited by\r\nCaptain J. R. M. Taylor, are published, all the captured documents\r\non this and later matters will be brought together.\r\n\r\n[159] The same as has frequently been cited as the program of reforms\r\npromised by Primo de Rivera, or even as being contained in an actual\r\ntreaty. Such statements have usually been reproduced from Foreman or\r\ndirectly from insurgent proclamations. It is notable that in these\r\n(e.g., that of the La Junta Patriótica, Hongkong, April, 1898) it\r\nis only declared that Primo de Rivera \"promised\" these reforms, and\r\nthat he himself would remain in the Philippines during a three-year\r\n\"armistice,\" as a guarantee that the reforms would be carried out.\r\n\r\n[160] The document cited by Foreman (2nd ed., pp. 546-547; 3rd ed.,\r\npp. 397-398), read in the Cortes in 1898, was not the final agreement\r\nand the terms of payment are incorrect. It is either spurious, or\r\nwas superseded by the document, number 5 (of the same date) published\r\nin the Congressional Record, ut supra. This appears to have been the\r\nonly document in Aguinaldo's possession bearing the signature of Primo\r\nde Rivera, and it is merely a program prescribing the movements of\r\nthe rebel chiefs from December 14 on, terms of payments, surrender\r\nof arms, amnesty, etc.\r\n\r\n[161] Memoria, p. 125, cablegram of October 7, 1896.\r\n\r\n[162] A slightly modified copy of this appeal is quoted by Primo de\r\nRivera (Memoria, pp. 140-141), and in Senate Document no. 208, pt. 2,\r\npp. 2, 3. The writer has a copy taken from one of the originals.\r\n\r\n[163] Pardo de Tavera remarks (Rept. Phil. Comm., 1900, ii, p. 396)\r\nthat someone \"forgot he had this sum of money in his pocket.\"\r\n\r\n[164] Paterno has apparently given to Foreman a partial version of\r\nthe transaction for the latter's 1906 edition. Therein Foreman comes\r\naround to imply that there was, after all, no \"treaty\" about reforms,\r\nbut he is still very much confused as to the money payments, etc.,\r\nand almost every sentence contains an inaccuracy. He appears to have\r\nseen the Diario de las Sesiones de Cortes, at least for one or two\r\nspeeches on this subject in 1898, when there were heated debates on\r\nPhilippine matters in the Cortes, but it is strange he never consulted\r\nPrimo de Rivera's detailed account of the affair.\r\n\r\n[165] It was declared, however, in the press of Spain that Aguinaldo\r\nprojected a residence in Europe and had started for Paris when\r\nConsul-General Pratt found him at Singapore in April, 1898.\r\n\r\n[166] The change of Spanish administration in October, 1897,\r\nbringing the Liberals again into power, with Moret, who had proposed\r\nsecularization of education in 1870, as Colonial Minister, was another\r\nreason for expecting liberal measures in the Philippines as well as in\r\nCuba. It was this new ministry which urged Primo de Rivera to conclude\r\nthe Biak-na-bató negotiation speedily. One of the indications that\r\nthe Biak-na-bató documents in the War Department, above cited, were\r\n\"doctored\" in some particulars is the insertion in Paterno's letter\r\nto Aguinaldo of Aug. 9, 1897, of a reference to Moret being Minister;\r\nthe change of cabinet in Madrid occurred two months later.\r\n\r\n[167] See the Memoria, pp. 159-176, on Reforms. In a temperate,\r\njudicial way his discussion of the friars, from experience as\r\nGovernor-General from 1881-83 and during the insurrection, is perhaps\r\nthe severest arraignment they could receive, above all since it came\r\nfrom a man appointed by a Conservative administration.\r\n\r\n[168] See the Memoria, pp. 144-154. The incident is related in various\r\ntones by other writers.\r\n\r\n[169] See the pamphlets, reprinting articles from two of these\r\nperiodicals: Juan Caro y Mora, La situación del país (Manila, 1897),\r\nseries in La Oceanía Española; and El gran problema de las reformas en\r\nFilipinas planteado por El Español, periódico diario de Manila (Manila,\r\n1897). These articles appeared while the Biak-na-bató negotiation\r\nwas pending, and with full official sanction; but they touched the\r\nreligious question only very cautiously, and mostly to defend the\r\nfriars. The articles of Caro y Mora especially merit consideration in\r\nconnection with the study of Spanish administration in its last stage.\r\n\r\n[170] See especially El Liberal, of Madrid. The writer has a copy\r\nof a broadside dated at Madrid Jan. 26, 1898, Exposición elevada á\r\nsa Majestad la Reina Regente sobre la insurrección en Filipinas,\r\nby Vital Fité, a Spanish journalist, once provincial governor in\r\nthe Philippines. It represents friar-rule as the chief grievance,\r\nbut recites also abuses and defects of administration.\r\n\r\n[171] See J. Pellicena y Lopez, Los frailes y los filipinos (Manila,\r\n1901).\r\n\r\n[172] An earlier indication of the friars' fear of coming reforms is\r\nthe pamphlet, Filipinas. Estudios de algunos asuntos de actualidad\r\n(Madrid, 1897), by Eduardo Navarro, procurator of Augustinians,\r\nwho advocates \"reform\" by means of \"a step backward.\"\r\n\r\n[173] As, e.g., does Pellicena y Lopez, in Los frailes y los filipinos,\r\nto prove that separation was not the aim of the propagandists. The\r\ncitation from Del Pilar's Soberanía monacal (paragraph v), is almost\r\nidentical with the paragraph of the 1888 petition to the Queen,\r\nquoted already.\r\n\r\n[174] The author of the preliminary report of the Schurman Commission,\r\nNov. 2, 1899, must simply have blindly followed Foreman and must\r\nhave somewhat misunderstood his Filipino informants, in order to make\r\nthese remarkable statements (Report, i, pp. 169, 172): \"This movement\r\n[rebellion of 1896] was in no sense an attempt to win independence,\r\nbut was merely an attempt to obtain relief from abuses which were\r\nrapidly growing intolerable.\" \"Now [June, 1898] for the first time\r\narose the idea of independence [in Aguinaldo's camp].\"\r\n\r\n[175] A quite sufficient answer, if there were not plenty of others,\r\nto Dr. Schurman's statements quoted above is afforded by this passage\r\nin a proclamation of Aguinaldo as Magdalo at Old Cavite (Kawit),\r\nOct. 31, 1896 (Castillo y Jimenez, El Katipunan, pp. 298-302): \"The\r\nrevolutionary committee addresses to all Filipino citizens who love\r\ntheir country a general call to arms for the proclamation of Filipino\r\nliberty and independence as [a matter of] right and justice, and the\r\nrecognition of the new revolutionary government established by the\r\nblood of its sons.\" And, on the same date, in a proclamation outlining\r\na rough revolutionary organization of Cavite province and each of\r\nits towns, he says: \"Filipinas witnesses today a fact unprecedented\r\nin its history: the conquest of its liberty and of its independence,\r\nthe most noble and lofty of its rights.\" Yet, in March, 1897, Aguinaldo\r\ndiscussed in the correspondence with the Jesuit superior, as already\r\nmentioned, the reforms he thought the country asked, and expressly\r\ndisclaimed for the revolutionists the aim for independence. So also\r\nhis proclamations and interviews on leaving for Hongkong after the\r\npact of Biak-na-bató (see La Política de España en Filipinas, viii,\r\npp. 46, 47).\r\n\r\nHowever, in a letter to Fray Tomas Espejo (undated, but written\r\nprobably in January, 1898), Aguinaldo says: \"A great work is this,\r\nwhich demands great sacrifices, followed by the shedding of quantities\r\nof blood. But what matters that, for it is very little compared to the\r\nsublime and holy end which we hold before ourselves in attempting to\r\ntake arms against España. For this we have resolved to sacrifice our\r\nlives until we shall hear issue from the mouths of our compatriots,\r\nthe blessed phrase 'All hail, Filipinas! forever separated from España\r\nand conquered through the heroism of their inhabitants.'\" (La Política\r\nde España, viii, p. 44).--Eds.\r\n\r\n[176] See Sastrón's account of Biak-na-bató in chapters v and vi\r\nof his Insurrección en Filipinas for some fragments of documents on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\n[177] A royal decree of Jan. 22, 1784, by Carlos III, declared the\r\nex-Jesuits competent to acquire and hold property; and, in the case of\r\nthose secular coadjutors who had married, to bequeath their property\r\nto their heirs. That monarch died in 1788; and was succeeded by his\r\neldest son, as Carlos IV. In Oct. 1797, the government learned that\r\nthe Spanish ex-Jesuits were determined to return to Spain, on account\r\nof the persecutions and even death which menaced them in the Genoese\r\nterritories, owing to a change in the government there, and that some\r\nof them had already reached the Spanish ports; it therefore decided\r\nthat they should be allowed to remain in the country, but must live in\r\ncertain abandoned convents. The Jesuits objected to this, and finally\r\nthe government permitted them (1798) to retire freely to the homes\r\nof their families or into any convents they might choose, save that\r\nthey were not allowed to reside in Madrid or other royal seats. \"Many\r\nex-Jesuits returned to their fatherland, and others decided to remain\r\nin Italia; but this situation did not last long, for in the year 1801\r\nanother decree was issued condemning them anew to proscription.\" Orders\r\nwere given that within one week all Jesuits should leave their homes\r\nand present themselves at Alicante or Barcelona, where new orders\r\nwould be given them. Some fathers advanced in years were allowed to\r\nremain in Spain; but all the rest were for the second time shipped\r\nto Italy, where they suffered great hardship. In 1808 the Spanish\r\ngovernment felt more leniently toward these unfortunate exiles,\r\nconsidering, moreover, the difficulty of furnishing their pensions,\r\nand the fact that all those moneys were thus taken out of Spain to\r\nforeign countries, to find their way ultimately into the hands of\r\nher enemies; and a royal decree by Fernando VII, dated Nov. 15, 1808,\r\ngranted permission to those Jesuits who desired to return to Spain,\r\nwith the same pension which they had been receiving. After the war\r\nbetween Spain and France was ended, urgent requests were made to\r\nFernando VII by various personages prominent in ecclesiastical,\r\neducational, and municipal affairs that he would reëstablish in\r\nhis dominions the Society of Jesus; and permission was given by a\r\nroyal decree dated May 9, 1815, for the Jesuits to have houses in\r\nthe towns and cities which had asked for them. A year later, after\r\nvarious preparations for this change had been made by the government,\r\nanother decree extended the reëstablishment to all the towns where\r\nthe Jesuits had formerly had their institutions. \"In virtue of this,\r\nall the Spanish Jesuits who were residing in Italy returned to España,\r\nat the expense of the court. All these decisions were adopted in\r\nEspaña in fulfilment of the bull of Pius VII dated Aug. 7, 1814,\r\nSolicitudo omnium ecclesiarum, by which the Jesuits were reëstablished\r\nin all the Catholic countries--that of Clement XIV, which decreed\r\nthe extinction of the order, being thereby annulled. [177A] Not five\r\nyears had passed after the reëstablishment of the Society of Jesus in\r\nEspaña when, the revolution of 1820 having been successful, the Cortes\r\nassembled; and the Spanish monarch, by decree of September 6 in that\r\nsame year, again suppressed the [Jesuit] institute, together with the\r\nother monastic orders, allowing the Jesuits, however, liberty to\r\nreside in España. Fernando communicated to his Holiness the above\r\ndecision, and Pius VII replied in a letter of September 15, expressing\r\nthe displeasure with which he had received the tidings; but in 1823,\r\nthe constitutional government having been destroyed, the regency\r\nissued a decree on June 11, reëstablishing the Society and the rest\r\nof the regular orders in the same condition in which they were before\r\nMarch 7, 1820. Fernando VII died on Sept. 29, 1833, and the civil war\r\nbegan; and on July 17, 1834, occurred the lamentable massacre [177B]\r\nof the Jesuits and other religious. By royal decree of July 4, 1835,\r\nthe Society of Jesus was anew declared extinguished; and its property\r\nwas ordered to be sold, in order to apply the product thereof to the\r\nextinction of the public debt. In spite of this decision, the Jesuits\r\nremained established in España; and it was necessary, in the last\r\nrevolutionary period, to issue the decree of Oct. 12, 1868,\r\nsuppressing the Society of Jesus in the Peninsula and the adjacent\r\nislands; and commanding that within the space of three days all their\r\ncolleges and institutions should be closed, and possession be taken\r\nof their temporalities in the form provided on this point by the royal\r\ndecree of July 4, 1835. To these provisions were added this, that the\r\nindividuals of the suppressed Society might not again reunite in a\r\nbody or a community, nor wear the garb of the order, nor be in any way\r\nsubordinate to the superiors of the order who existed either within or\r\nwithout España, those who were not ordained in sacris remaining subject\r\nin all matters to the ordinary civil jurisdiction. But the realization\r\nof this measure was ephemeral; for when the constitution of June 5,\r\n1869, was published, the right of every person was declared--and\r\nrepeated in the constitution of June 30, 1876--to associate with others\r\nfor all the purposes in human life which are not opposed to public\r\nmorals; and, by favor of this liberty, the individuals of the Society\r\nof Jesus considered themselves authorized to form an  association and\r\nfound anew colleges and houses in the Spanish dominions.\"\r\n\r\nA brief of Pope Leo XIII, dated July 13, 1886, finally reëstablished\r\nthe Society of Jesus throughout the world, and abrogated that of\r\nClement XIV which in 1773 suppressed the order. The pope took occasion\r\nto express this permission in the warmest and most forcible terms; and\r\n\"the rehabilitation of the Society of Jesus could not have been more\r\ncomplete or more satisfactory.\" \"It is pleasant to observe that,\r\nafter three centuries of strife, the principle of authority has\r\ntriumphed.\" (Danvila, Reinado de Carlos III, iii, pp. 613-625.)\r\n\r\n[177A] A letter from Mariano Fernandez Folgueras, dated Manila, Aug.\r\n18, 1819, mentions the decrees of Fernando VII by which the Society\r\nof Jesus is to be established throughout Spanish dominions, and\r\npromises obedience to the royal orders.\r\n\r\n[177B] An epidemic of cholera was raging in Madrid, and some malicious\r\npersons persuaded the common people that it was caused by the friars\r\nhaving poisoned the water. A mob broke into the Jesuit convents and\r\nmurdered many of the inmates; and over a hundred friars were killed\r\nfor the same reason.\r\n\r\n[178] This constitution was partly printed at London, at the London\r\nPrinting Press, No. 25 Khulug St., in both Spanish and Tagálog. Those\r\nparts printed (the ends, duties of the members, and the general rules)\r\ncontain some changes from Rizal's MS. Preceding the constitution\r\nproper is the membership pledge to the Liga. It is as follows:\r\n\"Number ... To ... of ... I ... of ... years of age, of ... state,\r\nprofession ..., as a chosen son of Filipinas, declare under formal\r\noath that I know and entirely understand the ends aimed at by the Liga\r\nFilipina, whose text appears on the back of the present. Therefore,\r\nI submit myself, and of my own accord petition the chief ... of this\r\nprovince, to admit me as a member and coworker in the same, and for\r\nthat purpose I am ready to unconditionally lend the necessary proofs\r\nthat may be demanded of me, in testimony of my sincere adhesion!\" The\r\nends of this printed text are the same as those of the MS. The motto\r\nis the same, and there is also a place for a countersign. The duties\r\nof the members are somewhat changed, the changes being as follows:\r\n\"1. He shall pay two pesos for one single time, as an entrance fee, and\r\nfifty centimos as monthly fee, from the month of his entrance. 2. With\r\nthe consciousness of what he owes to his fatherland, for whose\r\nprosperity and through the welfare that he ought to covet for his\r\nparents, children, brothers and sisters, and the beloved beings who\r\nsurround him, he must sacrifice every personal interest, and blindly\r\nand promptly obey every command, every order, verbal or written, which\r\nemanates from his Council or from the Provincial Chief. 3. He shall\r\nimmediately inform, and without the loss of a moment, the authorities\r\nof his Council of whatever he sees, notes, or hears that constitutes\r\ndanger for the tranquillity of the Liga Filipina or anything touching\r\nit. He shall earnestly endeavor to be sincere, truthful, and minute in\r\nall that he shall have to communicate. 4. He shall observe the utmost\r\nsecrecy in regard to the deeds, acts, and decisions of his Council and\r\nof the Liga Filipina in general from the profane, even though they be\r\nhis parents, brothers and sisters, children, etc., at the cost of his\r\nown life, for this is the means by which the member will obtain what\r\nhe most desires in life.\" Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are the same. The\r\ngeneral rules of the printed version are as follows: \"In order that\r\nthe candidate may be admitted as a member to the Liga Filipina,\r\nhe must possess morality, good habits, not have been proceeded\r\nagainst justifiably as a robber, shall not be a gambler, drunkard,\r\nor libertine. The candidate must solicit and petition his entrance\r\nfrom a member; and the latter shall communicate it to his Fiscal, for\r\nthe investigations that must be made in regard to his conduct.\" On\r\nDec. 30, 1903, a monument was erected to Rizal, to his companions,\r\nand to other founders of the Liga Filipina by the village of Tondo,\r\non a site given by Timoteo Paez, one of the members of the Liga. On the\r\nmonument is the following inscription: \"Remember [this word in English,\r\nthe rest in Spanish]. Facing this site and at house No. 176 Ilaya\r\nSt., Dr. Rizal founded and inaugurated on the night of July 3, 1892,\r\nthe Liga Filipina, a national secret society, with the assistance and\r\napproval of the following gentlemen: Founder, Dr. Rizal; shot.

He says mistakenly that the constitution was printed\r\nin Hong-Kong.\r\n\r\n[179] This was Fernando Primo de Rivera, whose term ended April\r\n11, 1898.\r\n\r\n[180] The Consejo de Ministros is the council formed by the ministers\r\nof the various departments, in order to discuss the most important\r\nand arduous matters, or for the purpose of working harmoniously in\r\nthe discharge of their respective duties. The sovereign presides,\r\nor the minister chosen as chief of the cabinet, who is called\r\npresident of the Council of Ministers. These councils are ordinary and\r\nextraordinary, according as they are held periodically or when demanded\r\nby circumstances. Thus the meetings of the council are analogous to\r\nthose of the cabinet of the United States. See Dic. encic. Hisp.-Amer.,\r\nv, p. 823.\r\n\r\n[181] i.e., \"Dumb dogs not able to bark,\" a portion of Isaias lvi, 10.\r\n\r\n[182] The Spanish Cortes is made up of the Senate (Senado) and the\r\ncongress (congreso), and in them, together with the king, resides\r\nthe legislative power, according to the constitution of 1876. The\r\npresent Cortes is the outgrowth of the Cortes formerly assembled by\r\nthe king before the adoption of the constitution, or rather it is the\r\nsubstitute that has supplanted them; for the inherent principle today\r\nis that sovereignty resides in the nation instead of the king. See\r\nDic. encic. Hisp.-Amer., v, pp. 1166, 1167.\r\n\r\n[183] See ante, pp. 195-201. See also North American Review, August,\r\n1901, \"The Katipunan of the Philippines,\" by Col. L. W. V. Kennon,\r\np. 212; and Primo de Rivera's Memorial.\r\n\r\n[184] The original is carbonario, a word used to indicate the member\r\nof a secret society, or the society itself. It is from the Italian\r\ncarbonaro, literally coal or charcoal dealer, and its origin is the\r\nsecret political sect of Italy, formed early in the nineteenth century,\r\nwith the avowed purpose of destroying tyranny and establishing freedom.\r\n\r\n[185] The first Filipino freemason lodge in the Philippines was founded\r\nin Cavite about 1860 by two Spanish naval officers under the name\r\nof Luz Filipina. It was established under the auspices of the Gran\r\nOriente Lusitana, and was in correspondence with the Portuguese lodges\r\nat Macao and Hong-Kong. Gradually other lodges were established and\r\nnatives and mestizos were admitted to membership. The \"Gran Oriente\"\r\nof the text is the Spanish division of the order, Spain and Portugal\r\nhaving split into two divisions after 1860. It is claimed by Catholics\r\nthat the Katipunan was the fighting branch of the masonic order. It\r\nis probably true that it borrowed some few things from freemasonry in\r\nmatters of form, but there the analogy seems to end. For the friar\r\nviewpoint of masonry in Spain and the Philippines, see Navarro's\r\nAlgunos asuntos de actualidad (Madrid, 1897), pp. 221-277; and\r\nPastells's La masonización de Filipinas. Sawyer's account (Inhabitants\r\nof the Philippines, pp. 79-81) is very inadequate.\r\n\r\n[186] i.e., \"It is better to die than to federate.\"\r\n\r\n[187] This passage (1 Machabees, iii, 59), reads in the English Douay\r\nversion: \"For it is better for us to die in battle, than to see the\r\nevils of our nation, and of the holies.\"\r\n\r\n[188] i.e., \"As long as I am the apostle, I shall honour my ministry,\"\r\na portion of Romans, xi, 13.\r\n\r\n[189] In the Ayer collection is a document dated Manila, January 17,\r\n1888, by one Candido Garcia, a native Filipino, an inhabitant of San\r\nFelipe Neri, in which he complains against the friar parish priest\r\nGregorio Chagra, O.S.F., who has endeavored to have him deported as\r\nanti-Spanish. The reason of this is because Garcia had complained\r\nthat the friar disobeyed the law in regard to burials as well as other\r\nlaws. He also accuses the friars of not wishing to have the Filipinos\r\nlearn Spanish, as they desire them to have no communication with\r\nSpaniards. He thus charges the friars with disobedience and disloyalty.\r\n\r\n[190] A brief statement by the pope of errors condemned in 1864,\r\nand known under the title Syllabus errorum. It was appended to\r\nthe encyclical Quanta cura, condemning eighty doctrines, which it\r\ncalls \"the principal errors of our times.\" These heresies had all\r\npreviously been pointed out by Pius IX in consistorial allocutions,\r\nand encyclical and other apostolic letters. It is a protest against\r\natheism, materialism, and other forms of infidelity. It condemns\r\nreligious and civil liberty, separation of Church and State, and\r\npreëminence of the Church of Rome. See Philip Schaff's Creeds of\r\nChristendom (New York, 1877), i, pp. 128-134 and ii, pp. 213-233\r\n(this last the Latin and English text of the Syllabus.)\r\n\r\n[191] We have taken the reading of the English Douay\r\nversion. Translated directly from the Spanish, this verse reads:\r\n\"If you be reproached for the name of Christ, you will be blessed; for\r\nthe honor, glory, and virtue of God, and His own spirit rest upon you.\"\r\n\r\n[192] Bartolomé de las Casas or Casaus, who was born in Sevilla in\r\n1474, and died in Madrid, in July, 1569, and because of his great\r\nexertions for the Indians called the \"apostle of the Indies.\" Much\r\nhas been written concerning this romantic and sincere character of\r\nearly American history. He wrote various books, some of which have\r\nbeen published. Mr. Ayer of Chicago possesses one volume in MS. of\r\nhis three-volume Historia general de Indias. This history (covering\r\nthe years 1492-1520) was begun in 1527 and completed in 1559.\r\n\r\n[193] Aguinaldo states that after he had been driven to the mountains\r\nin May, 1897, he established a republic. See North Amer. Rev., August,\r\n1901, p. 212. See also the constitution of the so-called republic in\r\nConstitución política de la Republica Filipina promulgada el dia 22\r\nde Enero de 1899 (1899).\r\n\r\n[194] See ante, p. 176.\r\n\r\n[195] This is Psalm 34 in the Douay version, but, as here, 35, in the\r\nVulgate, and common English versions. Psalm 9 in the Douay version\r\nis equivalent to 9 and 10 in the other versions. After verse 21 in\r\nthe Douay version is the sub-head \"Psalm according to the Hebrews,\"\r\nand the following verses are numbered from unity. The Vulgate has\r\nthe same heading, but regards the subject-matter as a new psalm.\r\n\r\n[196] We follow the Douay version to the word \"good\" (Psalm 34, 11,\r\nand part of 12). The rest of the passage we translate directly, as it\r\nhas no exact equivalent in this Psalm. The direct translation of the\r\nfirst two clauses of the Spanish is \"Unjust witnesses have risen up,\r\nand charged me with things of which I am ignorant.\"\r\n\r\n[197] i.e., \"Let another praise thee, and not thy own mouth,\" the\r\nfirst half of Proverbs xxvii, 2.\r\n\r\n[198] In the Douay version this verse reads: \"For so is the will\r\nof God, that by doing well you may put to silence the ignorance of\r\nfoolish men.\"\r\n\r\n[199] The Douay version reads: \"But we renounce the hidden things\r\nof dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word\r\nof God; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to\r\nevery man's conscience, in the sight of God.\" The last clause above\r\nis evidently taken from 2 Cor. i, 12.\r\n\r\n[200] A reference to Matthew, v, 13-16.\r\n\r\n[201] The first reference is to Psalm cviii, 2 (Douay version) but\r\ncxix, common English version. The second reference is to 1 Peter, iii,\r\n16. Neither one is an exact quotation, and hence we translate directly.\r\n\r\n[202] The cuadrilleros formerly acted as a police in the\r\nPhilippines. (See VOL. XVII, p. 333.) The guardia civil or civil\r\nguard was created in imitation of the guardia civil of Spain (the\r\nmost efficient body of police of that country, and analogous to the\r\ncarabinieri of Italy) in 1869. (See Montero y Vidal, Historia general,\r\niii, p. 494.)\r\n\r\n[203] Or robbers. They generally went in bands and had their retreats\r\nin the woods and hills.\r\n\r\n[204] See Col. L. W. V. Kennon's article in the North Amer. Review,\r\nfor August, 1901, \"The Katipunan of the Philippines.\" Many other\r\nwriters speak of this society, but as yet no real authentic account\r\nof it has appeared, as we are still too near it.\r\n\r\n[205] This was Governor Fernando Primo de Rivera y Sobremonte, who\r\nwrote a Memorial on his record in the Philippines, which was published\r\nat Madrid in 1898.\r\n\r\n[206] A required paper of identification carried by the natives,\r\nand for which they were taxed.\r\n\r\n[207] This was Pedro Alejandro Paterno.\r\n\r\n[208] These three sections are as follows:\r\n\r\n45. The entire direction of public schools, in which the youth of\r\nChristian states are educated, except (to a certain extent) in the\r\ncase of episcopal seminaries, may and must pertain to the civil power,\r\nand belong to it so far that no other authority whatsoever shall be\r\nrecognized as having any right to interfere in the discipline of the\r\nschools, the arrangement of the studies, the taking of degrees or\r\nthe choice and approval of the teachers.\r\n\r\n47. The best theory of civil society requires that popular schools\r\nopen to the children of all classes, and, generally, all public\r\ninstitutes intended for instruction in letters and philosophy, and\r\nfor conducting the education of the young, should be freed from all\r\necclesiastical authority, government, and interference, and should\r\nbe fully subject to the civil and political power, in conformity with\r\nthe will of rulers and the prevalent opinions of the age.\r\n\r\n48. This system of instructing youth, which consists in separating\r\nit from the Catholic faith and from the power of the Church, and in\r\nteaching exclusively, or at least primarily, the knowledge of natural\r\nthings and the earthly ends of social life alone, may be approved\r\nby Catholics.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that Pius IX condemns these three sections as\r\nthe entire eighty of the Syllabus as errors or heresies. (See Schaff's\r\nCreeds of Christendom, ii, pp. 224, 225.)\r\n\r\n[209] This section or error is as follows:\r\n\r\n53. The laws for the protection of religious establishments, and\r\nsecuring their rights and duties, ought to be abolished: nay, more,\r\nthe civil government may lend its assistance to all who desire to quit\r\nthe religious life they have undertaken, and break their vows. The\r\ngovernment may also suppress religious orders, collegiate churches, and\r\nsimple benefices, even those belonging to private patronage, and submit\r\ntheir goods and revenues to the administration and disposal of the\r\ncivil power. (See Schaff's Creeds of Christendom, ii, pp. 226, 227.)\r\n\r\n[210] See VOL. LI, pp. 146, 147, note 103; and ante, pp. 83, 84,\r\nnote 33.\r\n\r\n[211] The Código de las siete partidas, so called because divided\r\ninto seven parts, were compiled by Alfonso the Wise, the work of\r\ncompilation beginning June 23, 1256, and being concluded probably in\r\n1265. See Dic. encic. Hisp.-Amer., xiv, pp. 982, 983.\r\n\r\n[212] See Synopsis and extracts of the instructions given to Legazpi\r\nin our VOL. II, pp. 89-100.\r\n\r\n[213] i.e., \"The offscouring;\" literally \"worthless soul.\"\r\n\r\n[214] i.e., \"We are made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring\r\nof all even until now,\" the last part of 1 Cor., iv, 13.\r\n\r\n[215] This Memorial is most inadequately published in the Rosary\r\nMagazine (a Dominican periodical) for 1900, by Ambrose Colman, O.P. It\r\nis translated only in part, the translation often being faulty and\r\ngiving a wrong meaning, and translation and synopsis not always being\r\nsufficiently indicated.\r\n\r\n[216] This \"notice\" does not appear in the copy printed (probably\r\nfrom one of the fifty copies) at the press of Viuda de M. Minuesa de\r\nlos Rios, Madrid.\r\n\r\n[217] A Tagálog word, meaning \"that which is in partnership.\"\r\n\r\n[218] Pacto de retrovendendo: \"A certain agreement accessory to the\r\ncontract of purchase and sale, by which the buyer obliges himself\r\nto return the thing sold to the seller, the latter returning to\r\nthe buyer the price which he gave for it, within a certain time, or\r\nwhen the seller shall require it, according to the terms in which\r\nthe agreement is drawn up.\" (Diccionario of the Academy, cited by\r\nDominguez.) Cf. the political use of the same phrase in the treaty\r\nof Zaragoza (VOL. 1, p. 232).\r\n\r\n[219] The word \"composition\" (Spanish, composición) as here used has \"a\r\ntechnical meaning as applied to lands, and may be defined as a method\r\nby which the State enabled an individual who held its lands without\r\nlegal title thereto to convert his mere possession into a perfect\r\nright of property by virtue of compliance with the requirements of\r\nlaw. Composition was made in the nature of a compact or compromise\r\nbetween the State and the individual who was illegally holding lands\r\nin excess of those to which he was legally entitled, and, by virtue\r\nof his compliance with the law, the State conferred on him a good\r\ntitle to the lands that he had formerly held under a mere claim of\r\ntitle.\" Under Spanish administration, there was great confusion and\r\nuncertainty in land-titles; the laws in force were too complicated and\r\nslow in operation, and left too much power in the hands of indifferent\r\nor mercenary officials. Some benefits were yielded by regulations for\r\nthe composition of State lands which were in force from 1880 to 1894,\r\nand in the latter year more definite and positive provisions were\r\nmade by royal decree (constituting the \"public-land law\" in force in\r\nthe islands when occupied by the United States) for the settlement\r\nof uncertain land-titles; but in neither case were the results very\r\nsatisfactory. The same may be said of the registration system known\r\nas the Ley hipotecaria (or mortgage law), which in 1889 was extended\r\nto Filipinas. During the period of revolution and war (1896-99) many\r\nof the land records were destroyed in the provinces, which further\r\ncomplicated questions of land ownership; and the U. S. Philippine\r\nCommission was obliged to make provision for the settlement of these\r\nby the \"Land Registration Act,\" which became effective on February 1,\r\n1903. For account of its provisions and mode of operation, see the\r\nchapter on \"Land Titles\" (pp. 127-137) in Official Handbook of the\r\nPhilippines--where also is presented a more detailed account of the\r\nregulations made by the Spanish laws.\r\n\r\n[220] At the foot of the last printed page is a note, evidently\r\nwritten by some person in the secretary's office of the Council of\r\nIndias (to which body this copy of the decree appears to have been\r\nsent), which reads in translation: \"It came with a letter from the\r\ngovernor of Philipinas, Don Joseph de Basco y Vargas, dated June 16,\r\n1784, and received at the secretary's office on March 19, 1785.\" A\r\npenciled memorandum on the fly-leaf indicates that it was published\r\nat Sampaloc, 1784.\r\n\r\n[221] By royal decree of Feb. 26, 1886, the alcaldes-mayor of the\r\nprovinces were restricted to judicial functions, and in others they\r\nwere replaced by civil governors.\r\n\r\n[222] Bernáldez, in his account (dated 1827) of \"Reforms needed in\r\nFilipinas\" (already presented in our VOL. LI) says of this association\r\n(fol. 29): \"Although in Manila there is an Economic Society organized\r\nto promote public prosperity by means of the industries of the country,\r\ncomposed as it is of miscellaneous members, nominated without [their\r\nown] solicitation, and without inclination for that sort of occupation,\r\nthere is little, if anything, to be expected from the activities of a\r\nbody which has already gone to pieces once through its own inaction,\r\nand has been reëstablished only to comply with the sovereign's command,\r\nand not by the activity or encouragement of the citizens of Filipinas\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\n[223] Evidently referring to the pamphlet, Noticia del origen y hechos\r\nnotables de la Real Sociedad ... segun sus actas y documentos oficiales\r\n(Manila, 1860); but this is a second edition, the first having been\r\nissued in 1855.\r\n\r\n[224] Probably referring to the book The Lancasterian System of\r\nEducation, with Improvements, published (Baltimore, 1821) by Joseph\r\nLancaster on his newly-invented educational system (commonly known as\r\nthe \"monitorial\"). He was an Englishman, born in 1778, and a member\r\nof the Society of Friends; he visited the United States, where he\r\npublished the above work; and his death occurred in 1838.\r\n\r\n[225] See account of this periodical in VOL. LI, p. 48, note 16.\r\n\r\n[226] This was Paul de la Gironière, a French surgeon who went to\r\nManila in 1820, and who escaped, almost by a miracle, from the massacre\r\nof foreigners by the natives in that year. He married a Spanish lady\r\nof Manila, the Marquesa de las Salinas, and spent twenty years in the\r\nislands, where he founded a colony at Jala-Jala, and kept a large\r\nestate under cultivation, besides performing, at various times,\r\nofficial functions entrusted to him by the Manila government. He\r\nreturned to France, where he died about 1865. He was author of a book,\r\nAventures d'un gentilhomme breton aux îles Philippines (Paris, 1855),\r\nwhich had considerable vogue, and is regarded as an interesting\r\nand in many respects valuable description of the islands, their\r\nresources and people, and social conditions there. He also wrote\r\nVingt années aux Philippines (Paris, 1853), of which an English\r\nabridgment was published in London soon afterward, called Twenty\r\nYears in the Philippines. (See Pardo de Tavera, Biblioteca filipina,\r\npp. 185-186.) An English translation with the same title was published\r\nat New York (1854), \"revised and extended by the author.\"\r\n\r\n[227] Apparently alluding to the short-lived periodical Precios\r\ncorrientes de Manila (1639-41); see VOL. LI, p. 71, note 31.\r\n\r\n[228] One of the largest and richest towns of the province of\r\nBulacán; and both town and province are renowned for various native\r\nmanufactures--hats, cigar-cases, piña fabrics, and petates (i.e.,\r\nmats)--of fine quality, and often very costly. See Jagor's account\r\n(Reisen, p. 48) of the manufacture of these cigar-cases at Balivag;\r\nthe fibers of which they are made are obtained from a certain\r\nspecies of Calamus (rattar), and the cases cost from two to fifty\r\npesos each. It appears that the word petaca comes (as does petate,\r\n\"mat\") from the Mexican word petlatl, meaning \"a mat.\"\r\n\r\n[229] \"In 1848 were procured from London the steamers 'Magallanes,'\r\n'Elcano,' and 'Reina de Castilla,' which were the first vessels\r\nof this class that were seen in Filipinas; and to their excellent\r\nservices are due the rapid transformation which was wrought in the\r\nprosperity of the country, and the repression of the piracies of the\r\nMoro Malays.\" (Montero y Vidal, Hist. de Filipinas, iii, p. 87.)\r\n\r\n[230] In the Archivo general de Indias at Sevilla are MS. reports of\r\nthis society's labors for a number of consecutive years.\r\n\r\n[231] Jiguilete (or xiquilite): the name given in India to the indigo\r\nshrub. The cerpentaria here mentioned is not identifiable, unless it be\r\nsome other species of Indigofera, several of which are cultivated in\r\nFilipinas. The \"Vanilla\" is presumably a plant described by Blanco,\r\nwhich he calls Vanilla ovalis, greatly resembling V. aromatica,\r\nexcept that it lacked the fragrant odor of the latter.\r\n\r\n[232] See Jagor's chapter (Reisen, pp. 309, 310) on the opium\r\nmonopoly which was established in Filipinas on Jan. 1, 1844, and\r\nlater continued by the Spanish government, after much discussion and\r\ncontroversy. Various arguments of policy, health, and morality were\r\nbrought forward on both sides, but that which finally triumphed was\r\nevidently the one thus stated by the governor-general, \"The revenue\r\nfrom opium is indispensable for our treasury.\" The use of opium in the\r\nislands was intended for the Chinese residing there (being forbidder to\r\nthe Indians and mestizos), and then only under certain restrictions;\r\nbut Jagor found that, besides the 478 public opium-joints--which were\r\n\"actual hotbeds of immorality, and always full of Chinese\"--hundreds\r\nof individuals were allowed, contrary to the law and to the intentions\r\nof the government, to smoke opium in their own houses. The revenue\r\nfrom opium amounted in 1860 to 98,000 escudos; in the fiscal year of\r\n1865-66, to 140,000; and in 1866-67, to 207,000. Montero y Vidal cites\r\nin Archipiélago filipino (published in 1886), the tariff schedule of\r\n1874, \"The importation of opium is prohibited; and only that will be\r\nallowed which, in small quantities, is destined for the pharmacies,\r\nand all that which may be imported by the lessees of the right to sell\r\nthis drug to whom the Treasury has granted that exclusive right in the\r\nprovinces there--in which case it will pay duty according to item 80\"\r\n(that is, at eight per cent).\r\n\r\n[233] A tree found in China (Stillingia sebifera), which yields a\r\nsubstance resembling tallow, which is used for the same purpose as\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n[234] Regarding the gutta-percha industry, see Official Handbook of\r\nthe Philippines, pp. 91-95.\r\n\r\n[235] The water supply of Manila is taken from the Mariquina River,\r\neight miles from the city, being pumped thence to a reservoir halfway\r\nto Manila, from which it is distributed. \"The works are owned by the\r\nmunicipality, having been largely paid for with a fund, the proceeds\r\nof a legacy, left by the will of a citizen, Francisco Carriedo,\r\nwho died in 1743.\" (Official Handbook, p. 269.) This was one of the\r\nobras pias founded by a public-spirited citizen, Francisco Carriedo\r\ny Peredo; he was born in the town of Santander in 1690, and died at\r\nthe age of 53, \"having during his life conferred immense benefits on\r\nFilipinas.\" (Vindel, Catálogo, i, pp. 155, 156.)\r\n\r\n[236] The botanical garden of Manila was created by Governor Norzagaray\r\n(by decree of Sept. 13, 1858); and, as a result of this, a royal decree\r\nof May 29, 1861, founded there a school o£ botany and agriculture,\r\nunder the control of the governor of the islands and immediate\r\nsupervision of the Economic Society. The locality called Campo de\r\nArroceros [\"the rice-dealers' field\"] was set apart as a botanical\r\ngarden, for the practical work of that school, with approval of\r\nthe expenditures incurred by the governor for the establishment of\r\nboth institutions; and the sum of 6,000 pesos a year was allowed for\r\ntheir maintenance. (In 1894-95, the budget included for the expenses\r\nof these two establishments the sum of 37,294 pesos.) See Montero y\r\nVidal, Hist. de Filipinas, iii, pp. 260, 261, 317, 318.\r\n\r\n[237] Worcester says of the Ifugaos (ut supra, p. 829): \"Their\r\nagriculture is little short of wonderful, and no one who has seen\r\ntheir dry stone dams, their irrigating ditches running for miles\r\nalong precipitous hillsides and even crossing the faces of cliffs,\r\nand their irrigated terraces extending for thousands of feet up the\r\nmountain sides, can fail to be impressed (Pl. xxvi, xxxvii). When\r\nwater must be carried across cliffs so hard and so broken that\r\nthe Ifugaos cannot successfully work the stone with their simple\r\ntools, they construct and fasten in place great troughs made from\r\nthe hollowed trunks of trees, and the same procedure is resorted\r\nto when cañons must be crossed, great ingenuity being displayed in\r\nbuilding the necessary supporting trestle-work of timber. The nearly\r\nperpendicular walls of their rice paddies are usually built of stone,\r\nalthough near Quiangan, where the country is comparatively open and\r\nlevel, walls of clay answer the same purpose, and are used. The stone\r\nretaining walls are sometimes forty feet high, and so steep are the\r\nmountain sides that the level plots gained by building such walls and\r\nfilling in behind them are often not more than twenty or thirty feet\r\nwide. I know of no more impressive example of primitive engineering\r\nthan the terraced mountain sides of Nueva Vizcaya, beside which the\r\nterraced hills of Japan sink into insignificance.\"",
