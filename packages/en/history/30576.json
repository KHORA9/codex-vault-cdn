STORIES\r\n\r\n(Texas)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420241\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Will Adams]\r\n\r\n\r\n     WILL ADAMS was born in 1857, a slave of Dave Cavin, in Harrison\r\n     Co., Texas. He remained with the Cavins until 1885, then farmed for\r\n     himself. Will lives alone in Marshall, Texas, supported by a $13.00\r\n     monthly pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My folks allus belongs to the Cavins and wore their name till after\r\n'mancipation. Pa and ma was named Freeman and Amelia Cavin and Massa\r\nDave fotches them to Texas from Alabama, along with ma's mother, what we\r\ncalled Maria.\r\n\r\n\"The Cavins allus thunk lots of their niggers and Grandma Maria say,\r\n'Why shouldn't they--it was their money.' She say there was plenty\r\nIndians here when they settled this country and they bought and traded\r\nwith them without killin' them, if they could. The Indians was poor\r\nfolks, jus' pilfer and loaf 'round all the time. The niggers was a heap\r\nsight better off than they was, 'cause we had plenty to eat and a place\r\nto stay.\r\n\r\n\"Young Massa Tom was my special massa and he still lives here. Old Man\r\nDave seemed to think more of his niggers than anybody and we thunk lots\r\nof our white folks. My pa was leader on the farm, and there wasn't no\r\noverseer or driver. When pa whip a nigger he needn't go to Massa Dave,\r\nbut pa say, 'Go you way, you nigger. Freeman didn't whip you for\r\nnothin'.' Massa Dave allus believe pa, 'cause he tells the truth.\r\n\r\n\"One time a peddler come to our house and after supper he goes to see\r\n'bout his pony. Pa done feed that pony fifteen ears of corn. The peddler\r\ntell massa his pony ain't been fed nothin', and massa git mad and say,\r\n'Be on you way iffen you gwine 'cuse my niggers of lyin'.'\r\n\r\n\"We had good quarters and plenty to eat. I 'members when I's jus'\r\nwalkin' round good pa come in from the field at night and taken me out\r\nof bed and dress me and feed me and then play with me for hours. Him\r\nbein' leader, he's gone from 'fore day till after night. The old heads\r\ngot out early but us young scraps slep' till eight or nine o'clock, and\r\ndon't you think Massa Dave ain't comin' round to see we is fed. I\r\n'members him like it was yest'day, comin' to the quarters with his stick\r\nand askin' us, 'Had your breakfas'?' We'd say, 'Yes, suh.' Then he'd ask\r\nif we had 'nough or wanted any more. It look like he taken a pleasure in\r\nseein' us eat. At dinner, when the field hands come in, it am the same\r\nway. He was sho' that potlicker was fill as long as the niggers want to\r\neat.\r\n\r\n\"The hands worked from sun to sun. Massa give them li'l crops and let\r\nthem work them on Saturday. Then he bought the stuff and the niggers go\r\nto Jefferson and buy clothes and sech like. Lots saved money and bought\r\nfreedom 'fore the war was over.\r\n\r\n\"We went to church and first the white preacher preached and then he\r\nlarns our cullud preachers. I seed him ordain a cullud preacher and he\r\ntold him to allus be honest. When the white preacher laid his hand on\r\nhim, all the niggers git to hollerin' and shoutin' and prayin' and that\r\nnigger git scart mos' to death.\r\n\r\n\"On Christmas we had all we could eat and drink and after that a big\r\nparty, and you ought to see them gals swingin' they partners round. Then\r\nmassa have two niggers wrestle, and our sports and dances was big sport\r\nfor the white folks. They'd sit on the gallery and watch the niggers put\r\nit on brown.\r\n\r\n\"Massa didn't like his niggers to marry off the place, but sometimes\r\nthey'd do it, and massa tell his neighbor, 'My nigger am comin' to you\r\nplace. Make him behave.' All the niggers 'haved then and they wasn't no\r\nHuntsville and gallows and burnin's then.\r\n\r\n\"Old massa went to war with his boy, Billie. They's lots of cryin' and\r\nweepin' when they sot us free. Lots of them didn't want to be free,\r\n'cause they knowed nothin' and had nowhere to go. Them what had good\r\nmassas stayed right on.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members when that Ku Klux business starts up. Smart niggers causes\r\nthat. The carpet-baggers ruint the niggers and the white men couldn't do\r\na thing with them, so they got up the Ku Klux and stirs up the world.\r\nThem carpet-baggers come round larnin' niggers to sass the white folks\r\nwhat done fed them. They come to pa with that talk and he told them,\r\n'Listen, white folks, you is gwine start a graveyard if you come round\r\nhere teachin' niggers to sass white folks.\" Them carpet-baggers starts\r\nall the trouble at 'lections in Reconstruction. Niggers didn't know\r\nanythin' 'bout politics.\r\n\r\n\"Mos' the young niggers ain't usin' the education they got now. I's been\r\nhere eighty years and still has to be showed and told by white folks.\r\nThese young niggers won't git told by whites or blacks either. They\r\nthinks they done knowed it all and that gits them in trouble.\r\n\r\n\"I stays with the Cavins mos' twenty years after the war. After I\r\nleaves, I allus farms and does odd jobs round town here. I's father of\r\nten chillen by one woman. I lives by myself now and they gives me $13.00\r\na month. I'd be proud to git it if it wasn't more'n a dollar, 'cause\r\nthey ain't nothin' a old man can do no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420055\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Adams]\r\n\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM ADAMS, 93, was born in slavery, with no opportunity for an\r\n     education, except three months in a public school. He has taught\r\n     himself to read and to write. His lifelong ambition has been to\r\n     become master of the supernatural powers which he believes to\r\n     exist. He is now well-known among Southwestern Negroes for his\r\n     faith in the occult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yous want to know and talk about de power de people tells you I has.\r\nWell, sit down here, right there in dat chair, befo' we'uns starts. I\r\ngits some ice water and den we'uns can discuss de subject. I wants to\r\n'splain it clearly, so yous can understand.\r\n\r\n\"I's born a slave, 93 years ago, so of course I 'members de war period.\r\nLike all de other slaves I has no chance for edumacation. Three months\r\nam de total time I's spent going to school. I teached myself to read and\r\nwrite. I's anxious to larn to read so I could study and find out about\r\nmany things. Dat, I has done.\r\n\r\n\"There am lots of folks, and edumacated ones, too, what says we'uns\r\nbelieves in superstition. Well, its 'cause dey don't understand. 'Member\r\nde Lawd, in some of His ways, can be mysterious. De Bible says so. There\r\nam some things de Lawd wants all folks to know, some things jus' de\r\nchosen few to know, and some things no one should know. Now, jus' 'cause\r\nyous don't know 'bout some of de Lawd's laws, 'taint superstition if\r\nsome other person understands and believes in sich.\r\n\r\n\"There is some born to sing, some born to preach, and some born to know\r\nde signs. There is some born under de power of de devil and have de\r\npower to put injury and misery on people, and some born under de power\r\nof de Lawd for to do good and overcome de evil power. Now, dat produces\r\ntwo forces, like fire and water. De evil forces starts de fire and I has\r\nde water force to put de fire out.\r\n\r\n\"How I larnt sich? Well, I's done larn it. It come to me. When de Lawd\r\ngives sich power to a person, it jus' comes to 'em. It am 40 years ago\r\nnow when I's fust fully realize' dat I has de power. However, I's allus\r\nint'rested in de workin's of de signs. When I's a little piccaninny, my\r\nmammy and other folks used to talk about de signs. I hears dem talk\r\nabout what happens to folks 'cause a spell was put on 'em. De old folks\r\nin dem days knows more about de signs dat de Lawd uses to reveal His\r\nlaws den de folks of today. It am also true of de cullud folks in\r\nAfrica, dey native land. Some of de folks laughs at their beliefs and\r\nsays it am superstition, but it am knowin' how de Lawd reveals His laws.\r\n\r\n\"Now, let me tell yous of something I's seen. What am seen, can't be\r\ndoubted. It happens when I's a young man and befo' I's realize' dat I's\r\none dat am chosen for to show de power. A mule had cut his leg so bad\r\ndat him am bleedin' to death and dey couldn't stop it. An old cullud man\r\nlive near there dat dey turns to. He comes over and passes his hand over\r\nde cut. Befo' long de bleedin' stop and dat's de power of de Lawd\r\nworkin' through dat nigger, dat's all it am.\r\n\r\n\"I knows about a woman dat had lost her mind. De doctor say it was\r\ncaused from a tumor in de head. Dey took an ex-ray picture, but dere's\r\nno tumor. Dey gives up and says its a peculiar case. Dat woman was took\r\nto one with de power of de good spirit and he say its a peculiar case\r\nfor dem dat don't understand. Dis am a case of de evil spell. Two days\r\nafter, de woman have her mind back.\r\n\r\n\"Dey's lots of dose kind of cases de ord'nary person never hear about.\r\nYous hear of de case de doctors can't understand, nor will dey 'spond to\r\ntreatment. Dat am 'cause of de evil spell dat am on de persons.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout special persons bein' chosen for to show de power, read yous\r\nBible. It says in de book of Mark, third chapter, 'and He ordained\r\ntwelve, dat dey should be with Him, dat He might send them forth to\r\npreach and to have de power to heal de sick and to cast out devils.' If\r\nit wasn't no evil in people, why does de Lawd say, 'cast out sich?' And\r\nin de fifth chapter of James, it further say, 'If any am sick, let him\r\ncall de elders. Let dem pray over him. De prayers of faith shall save\r\nhim.' There 'tis again, Faith, dat am what counts.\r\n\r\n\"When I tells dat I seen many persons given up to die, and den a man\r\nwith de power comes and saves sich person, den its not for people to say\r\nit am superstition to believe in de power.\r\n\r\n\"Don't forgit--de agents of de devil have de power of evil. Dey can put\r\nmisery of every kind on people. Dey can make trouble with de work and\r\nwith de business, with de fam'ly and with de health. So folks mus' be on\r\nde watch all de time. Folks has business trouble 'cause de evil power\r\nhave control of 'em. Dey has de evil power cast out and save de\r\nbusiness. There am a man in Waco dat come to see me 'bout dat. He say to\r\nme everything he try to do in de las' six months turned out wrong. It\r\nstarts with him losin' his pocketbook with $50.00 in it. He buys a\r\ncarload of hay and it catch fire and he los' all of it. He spends\r\n$200.00 advertisin' de three-day sale and it begin to rain, so he los'\r\nmoney. It sho' am de evil power.\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' he say, 'Dat am de way it go, so I comes to you.'\r\n\r\n\"I says to him, 'Its de evil power dat have you control and we'uns shall\r\ncause it to be cast out.' Its done and he has no more trouble.\r\n\r\n\"You wants to know if persons with de power for good can be successful\r\nin castin' out devils in all cases? Well, I answers dat, yes and no. Dey\r\ncan in every case if de affected person have de faith. If de party not\r\nhave enough faith, den it am a failure.\r\n\r\n\"Wearin' de coin for protection 'gainst de evil power? Dat am simple.\r\nLots of folks wears sich and dey uses mixtures dat am sprinkled in de\r\nhouse, and sich. Dat am a question of faith. If dey has de true faith in\r\nsich, it works. Otherwise, it won't.\r\n\r\n\"Some folks won't think for a minute of goin' without lodestone or de\r\nsalt and pepper mixture in de little sack, tied round dey neck. Some\r\nwears de silver coin tied round dey neck. All sich am for to keep away\r\nde effect of de evil power. When one have de faith in sich and dey\r\nacc'dently lose de charm, dey sho' am miserable.\r\n\r\n\"An old darky dat has faith in lodestone for de charm told me de\r\n'sperience he has in Atlanta once. He carryin' de hod and de fust thing\r\nhe does am drop some brick on he foot. De next thing, he foot slip as\r\nhim starts up de ladder and him and de bricks drap to de ground. It am\r\nlucky for him it wasn't far. Jus' a sprain ankle and de boss sends him\r\nhome for de day. He am 'cited and gits on de street car and when de\r\nconductor call for de fare, Rufus reaches for he money but he los' it\r\nor fergits it at home. De conductor say he let him pay nex' time and\r\nasks where he live. Rufus tells him and he say, 'Why, nigger, you is on\r\nde wrong car.' Dat cause Rufus to walk further with de lame foot dan if\r\nhe started walkin' in de fust place. He thinks there mus' be something\r\nwrong with he charm, and he look for it and it gone! Sho' 'nough, it am\r\nlos'. He think, 'Here I sits all day, and I won't make another move till\r\nI gits de lodestone. When de chillen comes from school I sends dem to de\r\ndrugstore for some of de stone and gits fixed.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, now, I's been waitin' for dat one 'bout de black cat crossin' de\r\nroad, and, sho' 'nough, it come. Let me ask you one. How many people can\r\nyous find dat likes to have de black cat cross in front of 'em? Dat's\r\nright, no one likes dat. Let dis old cullud person inform yous dat it am\r\nsho' de bad luck sign. It is sign of bad luck ahead, so turn back. Stop\r\nwhat yous doin'.\r\n\r\n\"I's tellin' yous of two of many cases of failure to took warnin' from\r\nde black cat. I knows a man call' Miller. His wife and him am takin' an\r\nauto ride and de black cat cross de road and he cussed a little and goes\r\non. Den it's not long till he turns de corner and his wife falls out of\r\nde car durin' de turn. When he goes back and picks her up, she am dead.\r\n\r\n\"Another fellow, call' Brown, was a-ridin' hossback and a black cat\r\ncross de path, but he drives on. Well, its not long till him hoss\r\nstumble and throw him off. De fall breaks his leg, so take a\r\nwarnin'--don't overlook de black cat. Dat am a warnin'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420192\r\n\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM M. ADAMS, spiritualist preacher and healer, who lives at\r\n     1404 Illinois Ave., Ft. Worth, Texas, was born a slave on the James\r\n     Davis plantation, in San Jacinto Co., Texas. After the war he\r\n     worked in a grocery, punched cattle, farmed and preached. He moved\r\n     to Ft. Worth in 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was bo'n 93 years ago, dat is whut my mother says. We didn' keep no\r\nrecord like folks does today. All I know is I been yere a long time. My\r\nmother, she was Julia Adams and my father he was James Adams. She's bo'n\r\nin Hollis Springs, Mississippi and my father, now den, he was bo'n in\r\nFlorida. He was a Black Creek Indian. Dere was 12 of us chillen. When I\r\nwas 'bout seven de missus, she come and gits me for her servant. I lived\r\nin de big house till she die. Her and Marster Davis was powerful good to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Marster Davis he was a big lawyer and de owner of a plantation. But all\r\nI do was wait on ole missus. I'd light her pipe for her and I helped her\r\nwid her knittin'. She give me money all de time. She had a little trunk\r\nshe keeped money in and lots of times I'd have to pack it down wid my\r\nfeets.\r\n\r\n\"I dis'member jus' how many slaves dere was, but dere was more'n 100. I\r\nsaw as much as 100 sold at a time. When dey tuk a bunch of slaves to\r\ntrade, dey put chains on 'em.\r\n\r\n\"De other slaves lived in log cabins back of de big house. Dey had dirt\r\nfloors and beds dat was made out of co'n shucks or straw. At nite dey\r\nburned de lamps for 'bout an hour, den de overseers, dey come knock on\r\nde door and tell 'em put de light out. Lots of overseers was mean.\r\nSometimes dey'd whip a nigger wid a leather strap 'bout a foot wide and\r\nlong as your arm and wid a wooden handle at de end.\r\n\r\n\"On Sat'day and Sunday nites dey'd dance and sing all nite long. Dey\r\ndidn' dance like today, dey danced de roun' dance and jig and do de\r\npigeon wing, and some of dem would jump up and see how many time he\r\ncould kick his feets 'fore dey hit de groun'. Dey had an ole fiddle and\r\nsome of 'em would take two bones in each hand and rattle 'em. Dey sang\r\nsongs like, 'Diana had a Wooden Leg,' and 'A Hand full of Sugar,' and\r\n'Cotton-eyed Joe.' I dis'member how dey went.\r\n\r\n\"De slaves didn' have no church den, but dey'd take a big sugar kettle\r\nand turn it top down on de groun' and put logs roun' it to kill de\r\nsoun'. Dey'd pray to be free and sing and dance.\r\n\r\n\"When war come dey come and got de slaves from all de plantations and\r\ntuk 'em to build de breastworks. I saw lots of soldiers. Dey'd sing a\r\nsong dat go something like dis:\r\n\r\n\"'Jeff Davis rode a big white hoss,\r\nLincoln rode a mule;\r\nJess Davis is our President,\r\nLincoln is a fool.'\r\n\r\n\"I 'member when de slaves would run away. Ole John Billinger, he had a\r\nbunch of dogs and he'd take after runaway niggers. Sometimes de dogs\r\ndidn' ketch de nigger. Den ole Billinger, he'd cuss and kick de dogs.\r\n\r\n\"We didn' have to have a pass but on other plantations dey did, or de\r\npaddlerollers would git you and whip you. Dey was de poor white folks\r\ndat didn' have no slaves. We didn' call 'em white folks dem days. No,\r\nsuh, we called dem' Buskrys.'\r\n\r\n\"Jus' fore de war, a white preacher he come to us slaves and says: 'Do\r\nyou wan' to keep you homes whar you git all to eat, and raise your\r\nchillen, or do you wan' to be free to roam roun' without a home, like de\r\nwil' animals? If you wan' to keep you homes you better pray for de South\r\nto win. All day wan's to pray for de South to win, raise the\r\nhand.' We all raised our hands 'cause we was skeered not to, but we sho'\r\ndidn' wan' de South to win.\r\n\r\n\"Dat night all de slaves had a meetin' down in de hollow. Ole Uncle\r\nMack, he gits up and says: 'One time over in Virginny dere was two ole\r\nniggers, Uncle Bob and Uncle Tom. Dey was mad at one 'nuther and one day\r\ndey decided to have a dinner and bury de hatchet. So day sat\r\ndown, and when Uncle Bob wasn't lookin' Uncle Tom put some poison in\r\nUncle Bob's food, but he saw it and when Uncle Tom wasn't lookin', Uncle\r\nBob he turned de tray roun' on Uncle Tom, and he gits de poison food.'\r\nUncle Mack, he says: 'Dat's what we slaves is gwine do, jus' turn de\r\ntray roun' and pray for de North to win.'\r\n\r\n\"After de war dere was a lot of excitement 'mong de niggers. Dey was\r\nrejoicin' and singin'. Some of 'em looked puzzled, sorter skeered like.\r\nBut dey danced and had a big jamboree.\r\n\r\n\"Lots of 'em stayed and worked on de halves. Others hired out. I went to\r\nwork in a grocery store and he paid me $1.50 a week. I give my mother de\r\ndollar and keeped de half. Den I got married and farmed for awhile. Den\r\nI come to Fort Worth and I been yere since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420198\r\n\r\n\r\n     SARAH ALLEN was born a slave of John and Sally Goodren, in the Blue\r\n     Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Before the Civil War, her owners came\r\n     to Texas, locating near a small town then called Freedom. She lives\r\n     at 3322 Frutas St., El Paso, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was birthed in time of bondage. You know, some people are ashamed to\r\ntell it, but I thank God I was 'llowed to see them times as well as now.\r\nIt's a pretty hard story, how cruel some of the marsters was, but I had\r\nthe luck to be with good white people. But some I knew were put on the\r\nblock and sold. I 'member when they'd come to John Goodren's place to\r\nbuy, but he not sell any. They'd have certain days when they'd sell off\r\nthe block and they took chillen 'way from mothers, screamin' for dere\r\nchillen.\r\n\r\n\"I was birthed in ole Virginia in de Blue Ridge Mountains. When de white\r\npeople come to Texas, de cullud people come with them. Dat's been a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"My maw was named Charlotte, my paw Parks Adams. He's a white man. I\r\nguess I'm about eighty some years ole.\r\n\r\n\"You know, in slavery times when dey had bad marsters dey'd run away,\r\nbut we didn' want to. My missus would see her people had something good\r\nto eat every Sunday mornin'. You had to mind your missus and marster and\r\nyou be treated well. I think I was about twelve when dey freed us and we\r\nstayed with marster 'bout a year, then went to John Ecols' place and\r\nrented some lan'. We made two bales of cotton and it was the first money\r\nwe ever saw.\r\n\r\n\"Back when we lived with Marster Goodren we had big candy pullin's.\r\nInvite everybody and play. We had good times. De worst thing, we didn'\r\nnever have no schoolin' till after I married. Den I went to school two\r\nweeks. My husban' was teacher. He never was a slave. His father bought\r\nfreedom through a blacksmith shop, some way.\r\n\r\n\"I had a nice weddin'. My dress was white and trimmed with blue ribbon.\r\nMy second day dress was white with red dots. I had a beautiful veil and\r\na wreath and 'bout two, three waiters for table dat day.\r\n\r\n\"My mother was nearly white. Brighter than me. We lef' my father in\r\nVirginia. I was jus' as white as de chillen I played with. I used to be\r\nplum bright, but here lately I'm gettin' awful dark.\r\n\r\n\"My husban' was of a mixture, like you call bright ginger-cake color. I\r\ndon' know where he got his learnin'. I feel so bad since he's gone to\r\nGlory.\r\n\r\n\"Now I'm ole, de Lord has taken care of me. He put that spirit in people\r\nto look after ole folks and now my chillen look after me. I've two sons,\r\none name James Allen, one R.M. Both live in El Paso.\r\n\r\n\"After we go to sleep, de people will know these things, 'cause if\r\nfreedom hadn' come, it would have been so miserable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420149\r\n\r\n\r\n     ANDY ANDERSON, 94, was born a slave of Jack Haley, who owned a\r\n     plantation in Williamson Co., Texas. During the Civil War, Andy was\r\n     sold to W.T. House, of Blanco County, who in less than a year sold\r\n     Andy to his brother, John House. Andy now lives with his third wife\r\n     and eight of his children at 301 Armour St., Fort Worth, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My name am Andy J. Anderson, and I's born on Massa Jack Haley's\r\nplantation in Williamson County, Texas, and Massa Haley owned my folks\r\nand 'bout twelve other families of niggers. I's born in 1843 and that\r\nmakes me 94 year old and 18 year when de war starts. I's had 'speriences\r\ndurin' dat time.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Haley am kind to his cullud folks, and him am kind to everybody,\r\nand all de folks likes him. De other white folks called we'uns de petted\r\nniggers. There am 'bout 30 old and young niggers and 'bout 20\r\npiccaninnies too little to work, and de nuss cares for dem while dey\r\nmammies works.\r\n\r\n\"I's gwine 'splain how it am managed on Massa Haley's plantation. It am\r\nsort of like de small town, 'cause everything we uses am made right\r\nthere. There am de shoemaker and he is de tanner and make de leather\r\nfrom de hides. Den massa has 'bout a thousand sheep and he gits de wool,\r\nand de niggers cards and spins and weaves it, and dat makes all de\r\nclothes. Den massa have cattle and sich purvide de milk and de butter\r\nand beef meat for eatin'. Den massa have de turkeys and chickens and de\r\nhawgs and de bees. With all that, us never was hongry.\r\n\r\n\"De plantation am planted in cotton, mostly, with de corn and de wheat a\r\nlittle, 'cause massa don't need much of dem. He never sell nothin' but\r\nde cotton.\r\n\r\n\"De livin' for de cullud folks am good. De quarters am built from logs\r\nlike deys all in dem days. De floor am de dirt but we has de benches and\r\nwhat is made on de place. And we has de big fireplace for to cook and we\r\nhas plenty to cook in dat fireplace, 'cause massa allus 'lows plenty\r\ngood rations, but he watch close for de wastin' of de food.\r\n\r\n\"De war breaks and dat make de big change on de massas place. He jines\r\nde army and hires a man call' Delbridge for overseer. After dat, de hell\r\nstart to pop, 'cause de first thing Delbridge do is cut de rations. He\r\nweighs out de meat, three pound for de week, and he measure a peck of\r\nmeal. And 'twarn't enough. He half starve us niggers and he want mo'\r\nwork and he start de whippin's. I guesses he starts to edumacate 'em. I\r\nguess dat Delbridge go to hell when he died, but I don't see how de\r\ndebbil could stand him.\r\n\r\n\"We'uns am not use' to sich and some runs off. When dey am cotched there\r\nam a whippin' at de stake. But dat Delbridge, he sold me to Massa House,\r\nin Blanco County. I's sho' glad when I's sold, but it am short gladness,\r\n'cause here am another man what hell am too good for. He gives me de\r\nwhippin' and de scars am still on my arms and my back, too. I'll carry\r\ndem to my grave. He sends me for firewood and when I gits it loaded, de\r\nwheel hits a stump and de team jerks and dat breaks de whippletree. So\r\nhe ties me to de stake and every half hour for four hours, dey lays ta\r\nlashes on my back. For de first couple hours de pain am awful. I's never\r\nforgot it. Den I's stood so much pain I not feel so much and when dey\r\ntakes me loose, I's jus' 'bout half dead. I lays in de bunk two days,\r\ngittin' over dat whippin', gittin' over it in de body but not de heart.\r\nNo, suh, I has dat in de heart till dis day.\r\n\r\n\"After dat whippin' I doesn't have de heart to work for de massa. If I\r\nseed de cattle in de cornfield, I turns de back, 'stead of chasin' 'em\r\nout. I guess dat de reason de massa sold me to his brother, Massa John.\r\nAnd he am good like my first massa, he never whipped me.\r\n\r\n\"Den surrender am 'nounced and massa tells us we's free. When dat takes\r\nplace, it am 'bout one hour by sun. I says to myself, 'I won't be here\r\nlong.' But I's not realise what I's in for till after I's started, but I\r\ncouldn't turn back. For dat means de whippin' or danger from de patter\r\nrollers. Dere I was and I kep' on gwine. No nigger am sposed to be off\r\nde massa's place without de pass, so I travels at night and hides durin'\r\nde daylight. I stays in de bresh and gits water from de creeks, but not\r\nmuch to eat. Twice I's sho' dem patter rollers am passin' while I's\r\nhidin'.\r\n\r\n\"I's 21 year old den, but it am de first time I's gone any place, 'cept\r\nto de neighbors, so I's worried 'bout de right way to Massa Haley's\r\nplace. But de mornin' of de third day I comes to he place and I's so\r\nhongry and tired and scairt for fear Massa Haley not home from de army\r\nyit. So I finds my pappy and he hides me in he cabin till a week and den\r\nluck comes to me when Massa Haley come home. He come at night and de\r\nnext mornin' dat Delbridge am shunt off de place, 'cause Massa Haley\r\nseed he niggers was all gaunt and lots am ran off and de fields am not\r\nplowed right, and only half de sheep and everything left. So massa say\r\nto dat Delbridge, 'Dere am no words can 'splain what yous done. Git off\r\nmy place 'fore I smashes you.'\r\n\r\n\"Den I kin come out from my pappy's cabin and de old massa was glad to\r\nsee me, and he let me stay till freedom am ordered. Dat's de happies'\r\ntime in my life, when I gits back to Massa Haley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420317\r\n\r\n\r\nDibble, Fred, P.W., Beehler, Rheba, P.W., Beaumont, Jefferson, Dist. #3.\r\n\r\n     A frail sick man, neatly clad in white pajamas lying patiently in a\r\n     clean bed awaiting the end which does not seem far away.

Leon County News--Centerville, Texas--Thursday May 21, 1936.\r\n\r\nC. Consultant--Uncle Willis Anderson, resident of Centerville, Tex, born\r\nApril 15, 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interesting character at Centerville, Texas, is \"Uncle Willis\"\r\nAnderson, an ex-slave, born April 15, 1844, 6 miles west of Centerville\r\non the old McDaniels plantation near what is now known as Hopewell\r\nSettlement. It is generally said that \"Uncle Willis\" is one of the\r\noldest living citizens in the County, black or white. He is referred to\r\ngenerally for information concerning days gone by and for the history of\r\nthat County, especially in the immediate vicinity of Centerville.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Willis\" is an interesting figure. He may be found sitting on the\r\nporches of the stores facing Federal Highway No. 75, nodding or\r\nconversing with small groups of white or colored people that gather\r\naround him telling of the days gone by. He also likes to watch the\r\nbusses and automobiles that pass through the small town musing and\r\ncommenting on the swiftness of things today. Uncle Willis still\r\ncultivates a small patch five miles out from the town.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Willis\" is a tall dark, brown-skinned man having a large head\r\ncovered with mixed gray wooly hair. He has lost very few teeth\r\nconsidering his age. When sitting on the porches of the stores the soles\r\nof his farm-shoes may be seen tied together with pieces of wire. He\r\nsupports himself with a cane made from the Elm tree. At present he wears\r\na tall white Texas Centennial hat which makes him appear more unique\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Willis'\" memory is vivid. He is familiar with the older figures\r\nin the history of the County. He tells tales of having travelled by oxen\r\nto West Texas for flour and being gone for six months at a time. He\r\nremembers the Keechi and the Kickapoo Indians and also claims that he\r\ncan point out a tree where the Americans hung an Indian Chief. He says\r\nthat he has plowed up arrows, pots and flints on the Reubens Bains place\r\nand on the McDaniel farms. He can tell of the early lawlessness in the\r\nCounty. His face lights up when he recalls how the Yankee soldiers came\r\nthrough Centerville telling the slave owners to free their slaves. He\r\nalso talks very low when he mentions the name of Jeff Davis because he\r\nsays, \"Wha' man eavesdrops the niggers houses in slavery time and if\r\nyer' sed' that Jeff Davis was a good man, they barbecued a hog for you,\r\nbut if yer' sed' that Abe Lincoln was a good man, yer' had to fight or\r\ngo to the woods.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the most interesting tales told by \"Uncle Willis\" is the tale of\r\nthe \"Lead mine.\" \"Uncle Willis\" says that some where along Boggy Creek\r\nnear a large hickory tree and a red oak tree, near Patrick's Lake, he\r\nand his master, Auss McDaniels, would dig lead out of the ground which\r\nthey used to make pistol and rifle balls for the old Mississippi rifles\r\nduring slavery time. Uncle Willis claims that they would dig slags of\r\nlead out of the ground some 12 and 15 inches long, and others as large\r\nas a man's fist. They would carry this ore back to the big house and\r\nmelt it down to get the trash out of it, then they would pour it into\r\nmolds and make rifle balls and pistol balls from it. In this way they\r\nkept plenty of amunition on hand. In recent years the land has changed\r\nownership, and the present owners live in Dallas. Learning of the tale\r\nof the \"lead mine\" on their property they went to Centerville in an\r\nattempt to locate it and were referred to \"Uncle Willis.\" Uncle Willis\r\nsays they offered him two hundred dollars if he could locate the mine.\r\nBeing so sure that he knew its exact location, said that the $200 was\r\nhis meat. However, Uncle Willis was unable to locate the spot where they\r\ndug the lead and the mine remains a mystery.[C]\r\n\r\nRecently a group of citizens of Leon County including W.D. Lacey, Joe\r\nMcDaniel, Debbs Brown, W.H. Hill and Judge Lacey cross questioned Uncle\r\nWillis about the lead mine. Judge Lacey did the questioning while them\r\nothers formed an audience. The conversation went as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Which way would you go when you went to the mine?\" Judge Lacey asked.\r\n\r\n\"Out tow'hd Normangee.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long would it take you to get there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two or three hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it on a creek?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yessuh.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you cant go to it now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nosuh, I just can't recollect exactly where 'tis.[B]\r\n\r\nJ. Frank Dobie mentions many tales of lost lead mines throughout Texas\r\nin Coronado's Children, a publication of the Texas Folk-Lore Society.\r\nLead in the early days of the Republic and the State was very valuable,\r\nas it was the source of protection from the Indians and also the means\r\nof supplying food.[A]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420056\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mary Armstrong]\r\n\r\n\r\n     MARY ARMSTRONG, 91, lives at 3326 Pierce Ave., Houston, Texas. She\r\n     was born on a farm near St. Louis, Missouri, a slave of William\r\n     Cleveland. Her father, Sam Adams, belonged to a \"nigger trader,\"\r\n     who had a farm adjoining the Cleveland place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I's Aunt Mary, all right, but you all has to 'scuse me if I don't talk\r\nso good, 'cause I's been feelin' poorly for a spell and I ain't so young\r\nno more. Law me, when I think back what I used to do, and now it's all I\r\ncan do to hobble 'round a little. Why, Miss Olivia, my mistress, used to\r\nput a glass plumb full of water on my head and then have me waltz 'round\r\nthe room, and I'd dance so smoothlike, I don't spill nary drap.\r\n\r\n\"That was in St. Louis, where I's born. You see, my mamma belong to old\r\nWilliam Cleveland and old Polly Cleveland, and they was the meanest two\r\nwhite folks what ever lived, 'cause they was allus beatin' on their\r\nslaves. I know, 'cause mamma told me, and I hears about it other places,\r\nand besides, old Polly, she was a Polly devil if there ever was one, and\r\nshe whipped my little sister what was only nine months old and jes' a\r\nbaby to death. She come and took the diaper offen my little sister and\r\nwhipped till the blood jes' ran--jes' 'cause she cry like all babies do,\r\nand it kilt my sister. I never forgot that, but I sot some even with\r\nthat old Polly devil and it's this-a-way.\r\n\r\n\"You see, I's 'bout 10 year old and I belongs to Miss Olivia, what was\r\nthat old Polly's daughter, and one day old Polly devil comes to where\r\nMiss Olivia lives after she marries, and trys to give me a lick out in\r\nthe yard, and I picks up a rock 'bout as big as half your fist and hits\r\nher right in the eye and busted the eyeball, and tells her that's for\r\nwhippin' my baby sister to death. You could hear her holler for five\r\nmiles, but Miss Olivia, when I tells her, says, 'Well, I guess mamma has\r\nlarnt her lesson at last.' But that old Polly was mean like her husban',\r\nold Cleveland, till she die, and I hopes they is burnin' in torment now.\r\n\r\n\"I don't 'member 'bout the start of things so much, 'cept what Miss\r\nOlivia and my mamma, her name was Siby, tells me. Course, it's powerful\r\ncold in winter times and the farms was lots different from down here.\r\nThey calls 'em plantations down here but up at St. Louis they was jes'\r\ncalled farms, and that's what they was, 'cause we raises wheat and\r\nbarley and rye and oats and corn and fruit.\r\n\r\n\"The houses was builded with brick and heavy wood, too, 'cause it's cold\r\nup there, and we has to wear the warm clothes and they's wove on the\r\nplace, and we works at it in the evenin's.\r\n\r\n\"Old Cleveland takes a lot of his slaves what was in 'custom' and brings\r\n'em to Texas to sell. You know, he wasn't sposed to do that, 'cause when\r\nyou's in 'custom', that's 'cause he borrowed money on you, and you's not\r\nsposed to leave the place till he paid up. Course, old Cleveland jes'\r\ntells the one he owed the money to, you had run off, or squirmed out\r\nsome way, he was that mean.\r\n\r\n\"Mamma say she was in one bunch and me in 'nother. Mamma had been put\r\n'fore this with my papa, Sam Adams, but that makes no diff'rence to Old\r\nCleveland. He's so mean he never would sell the man and woman and\r\nchillen to the same one. He'd sell the man here and the woman there and\r\nif they's chillen, he'd sell them some place else. Oh, old Satan in\r\ntorment couldn't be no meaner than what he and Old Polly was to they\r\nslaves. He'd chain a nigger up to whip 'em and rub salt and pepper on\r\nhim, like he said, 'to season him up.' And when he'd sell a slave, he'd\r\ngrease their mouth all up to make it look like they'd been fed good and\r\nwas strong and healthy.\r\n\r\n\"Well mamma say they hadn't no more'n got to Shreveport 'fore some law\r\nman cotch old Cleveland and takes 'em all back to St. Louis. Then my\r\nlittle sister's born, the one old Polly devil kilt, and I's 'bout four\r\nyear old then.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Olivia takes a likin' to me and, though her papa and mama so mean,\r\nshe's kind to everyone, and they jes' love her. She marries to Mr. Will\r\nAdams what was a fine man, and has 'bout five farms and 500 slaves, and\r\nhe buys me for her from old Cleveland and pays him $2,500.00, and gives\r\nhim George Henry, a nigger, to boot. Lawsy, I's sho' happy to be with\r\nMiss Olivia and away from old Cleveland and Old Polly, 'cause they kilt\r\nmy little sister.\r\n\r\n\"We lives in St. Louis, on Chinquapin Hill, and I's housegirl, and when\r\nthe babies starts to come I nusses 'em and spins thread for clothes on\r\nthe loom. I spins six cuts of thread a week, but I has plenty of time\r\nfor myself and that's where I larns to dance so good. Law, I sho' jes'\r\ncrazy 'bout dancin'. If I's settin' eatin' my victuals and hears a\r\nfiddle play, I gets up and dances.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Will and Miss Olivia sho' is good to me, and I never calls Mr. Will\r\n'massa' neither, but when they's company I calls him Mr. Will and 'round\r\nthe house by ourselves I calls them 'pappy' and 'mammy', 'cause they\r\nraises me up from the little girl. I hears old Cleveland done took my\r\nmamma to Texas 'gain but I couldn't do nothin', 'cause Miss Olivia\r\nwouldn't have much truck with her folks. Once in a while old Polly comes\r\nover, but Miss Olivia tells her not to touch me or the others. Old Polly\r\ntrys to buy me back from Miss Olivia, and if they had they'd kilt me\r\nsho'. But Miss Olivia say, 'I'd wade in blood as deep as Hell 'fore I'd\r\nlet you have Mary.' That's jes' the very words she told 'em.\r\n\r\n\"Then I hears my papa is sold some place I don't know where. 'Course, I\r\ndidn't know him so well, jes' what mamma done told me, so that didn't\r\nworry me like mamma being took so far away.\r\n\r\n\"One day Mr. Will say, 'Mary, you want to go to the river and see the\r\nboat race?' Law me, I never won't forget that. Where we live it ain't\r\nfar to the Miss'sippi River and pretty soon here they comes, the Natchez\r\nand the Eclipse, with smoke and fire jes' pourin' out of they\r\nsmokestacks. That old captain on the 'Clipse starts puttin' in bacon\r\nmeat in the boiler and the grease jes' comes out a-blazin' and it beat\r\nthe Natchez to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"I stays with Miss Olivia till '63 when Mr. Will set us all free. I was\r\n'bout 17 year old then or more. I say I goin' find my mamma. Mr. Will\r\nfixes me up two papers, one 'bout a yard long and the other some\r\nsmaller, but both has big, gold seals what he says is the seal of the\r\nState of Missouri. He gives me money and buys my fare ticket to Texas\r\nand tells me they is still slave times down here and to put the papers\r\nin my bosom but to do whatever the white folks tells me, even if they\r\nwants to sell me. But he say, 'Fore you gets off the block, jes' pull\r\nout the papers, but jes' hold 'em up to let folks see and don't let 'em\r\nout of your hands, and when they sees them they has to let you alone.'\r\n\r\n\"Miss Olivia cry and carry on and say be careful of myself 'cause it\r\nsho' rough in Texas. She give me a big basket what had so much to eat in\r\nit I couldn't hardly heft it and 'nother with clothes in it. They puts\r\nme in the back end a the boat where the big, old wheel what run the boat\r\nwas and I goes to New Orleans, and the captain puts me on 'nother boat\r\nand I comes to Galveston, and that captain puts me on 'nother boat and I\r\ncomes up this here Buffalo Bayou to Houston.\r\n\r\n\"I looks 'round Houston, but not long. It sho' was a dumpy little place\r\nthen and I gets the stagecoach to Austin. It takes us two days to get\r\nthere and I thinks my back busted sho' 'nough, it was sich rough ridin'.\r\nThen I has trouble sho'. A man asks me where I goin' and says to come\r\n'long and he takes me to a Mr. Charley Crosby. They takes me to the\r\nblock what they sells slaves on. I gets right up like they tells me,\r\n'cause I 'lects what Mr. Will done told me to do, and they starts\r\nbiddin' on me. And when they cried off and this Mr. Crosby comes up to\r\nget me, I jes' pulled out my papers and helt 'em up high and when he\r\nsees 'em, he say, 'Let me see them.' But I says, 'You jes' look at it up\r\nhere,' and he squints up and say, 'This gal am free and has papers,' and\r\ntells me he a legislature man and takes me and lets me stay with his\r\nslaves. He is a good man.\r\n\r\n\"He tells me there's a slave refugee camp in Wharton County but I didn't\r\nhave no money left, but he pays me some for workin' and when the war's\r\nover I starts to hunt mamma 'gain, and finds her in Wharton County near\r\nwhere Wharton is. Law me, talk 'bout cryin' and singin' and cryin' some\r\nmore, we sure done it. I stays with mamma till I gets married in 1871 to\r\nJohn Armstrong, and then we all comes to Houston.\r\n\r\n\"I gets me a job nussin' for Dr. Rellaford and was all through the\r\nyellow fever epidemic. I 'lects in '75 people die jes' like sheep with\r\nthe rots. I's seen folks with the fever jump from their bed with death\r\non 'em and grab other folks. The doctor saved lots of folks, white and\r\nblack, 'cause he sweat it out of 'em. He mixed up hot water and vinegar\r\nand mustard and some else in it.\r\n\r\n\"But, law me, so much is gone out of my mind, 'cause I's 91 year old now\r\nand my mind jes' like my legs, jes' kinda hobble 'round a bit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420085\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sterlin Arnwine]\r\n\r\n\r\n     STEARLIN ARNWINE, 94, was born a slave to Albertus Arnwine, near\r\n     Jacksonville, Texas, who died when Stearlin was seven or eight. He\r\n     was bought by John Moseley, of Rusk, Texas, who made Stearlin a\r\n     houseboy, and was very kind to him. He now lives about six miles\r\n     west of Jacksonville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was bo'n 'fore de war, in 1853, right near this here town, on Gum\r\nCreek. My mammy belonged to Massa Albertus Arnwine, and he wasn' ever\r\nmarried. He owned four women, my mammy, Ann, my grandmother, Gracie, and\r\nmy Aunt Winnie and Aunt Mary. He didn' own any nigger men, 'cept the\r\nchillen of these women. Grandma lived in de house with Massa Arnwine and\r\nthe rest of us lived in cabins in de ya'd. My mammy come from Memphis\r\nbut I don' know whar my pappy come from. He was Ike Lane. I has three\r\nhalf brothers, and their names is Joe and Will and John Schot, and two\r\nsisters called Polly and Rosie.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Arnwine died 'fore de war and he made a will and it gave all he\r\nowned to the women he owned, and Jedge Jowell promised massa on his\r\ndeathbed he would take us to de free country, but he didn'. He took us\r\nto his place to work for him for 'bout two years and the women never did\r\nget that 900 acres of land Massa Arnwine willed to'em. I don' know who\r\ngot it, but they didn'. I knows I still has a share in that land, but it\r\ntakes money to git it in cou't.\r\n\r\n\"When war broke I fell into the han's of Massa John Moseley at Rusk.\r\nThey brought the dogs to roun' us up from the fiel's whar we was\r\nworkin'. I was the only one of my fam'ly to go to Massa John.\r\n\r\n\"I never did wo'k in the fiel's at Massa John's place. He said I mus' be\r\nhis houseboy and houseboy I was. Massa was sho' good to me and I did\r\nlove to be with him and follow him 'roun'.\r\n\r\n\"The kitchen was out in de ya'd and I had to carry the victuals to the\r\nbig dinin'-room. When dinner was over, Massa John tuk a nap and I had to\r\nfan him, and Lawsy me, I'd git so sleepy. I kin hear him now, for he'd\r\nwake up and say, 'Go get me a drink outta the northeast corner of de\r\nwell.'\r\n\r\n\"We had straw and grass beds, we put it in sacks on de groun' and slep'\r\non de sacks. I don' 'member how much land Massa John had but it was a\r\nbig place and he had lots of slaves. We chillun had supper early in de\r\nevenin' and mostly cornbread and hawg meat and milk. We all ate from a\r\nbig pot. I larned to spin and weave and knit and made lots of socks.\r\n\r\n\"Massa John had two step-daughters, Miss Mollie and Miss Laura, and they\r\nwen' to school at Rusk. It was my job to take 'em thar ev'ry Monday\r\nmornin' on horses and go back after 'em Friday afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"I never earnt no money 'fore freedom come, but once my brother-in-law\r\ngive me five dollars. I was so proud of it I showed it to de ladies and\r\none of 'em said, 'You don' need dat,' and she give me two sticks of\r\ncandy and tuk de money. But I didn' know any better then.\r\n\r\n\"I seed slaves for sale on de auction block. They sol' 'em 'cordin' to\r\nstrengt' and muscles. They was stripped to de wais'. I seed the women\r\nand little chillun cryin' and beggin' not to be separated, but it didn'\r\ndo no good. They had to go.\r\n\r\n\"The only chu'ch I knowed 'bout was when we'd git together in de night\r\nand have prayer meetin' and singin.' We use' to go way out in de woods\r\nso de white folks wouldn' hear nothin'. Sometimes we'd stay nearly all\r\nnight on Saturday, 'cause we didn' have to work Sunday.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout the only thing we could play was stick hosses. I made miles and\r\nmiles on the stick hosses. After the War Massa John have his chillun a\r\nbig roll of Confederate money and they give us some of it to trade and\r\nbuy stick hosses with.\r\n\r\n\"When Massa John tol' us we was free, he didn' seem to min', but Miss\r\nEm, she bawled and squalled, say her prop'ty taken 'way from her. After\r\ndat, my mammy gathers us togedder and tuk us to the Dr. Middleton place,\r\nout from Jacksonville. From thar to de Ragsdale place whar I's been ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n\"I wore my first pants when I was fourteen years ole, and they stung\r\n'till I was mis'ble. The cloth was store bought but mammy made the pants\r\nat home. It was what we called dog-hair cloth.

She was born a slave at the\r\n     North Slades' place. Mr. and Mrs. North Slade were the only owners\r\n     she ever had. She served as nurse-maid for her marster's children\r\n     and did general housework. She, with her mother and father and\r\n     family stayed with the Slades until the end of the year after the\r\n     Civil War. They then moved to themselves, hiring out to \"White\r\n     Folks.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My marster and mistress was good to all de slaves dat worked for dem.\r\nBut our over-seer, Jimmy Shearer, was sho' mean. One day he done git mad\r\nat me for some little somethin' and when I take de ashes to de garden he\r\ncatches me and churns me up and down on de groun'. One day he got mad\r\nat my brother and kicked him end over end, jes' like a stick of wood. He\r\nwould whip us 'til we was raw and then put pepper and salt in de sores.\r\nIf he thought we was too slow in doin' anything he would kick us off de\r\ngroun' and churn us up and down. Our punishment depended on de mood of\r\nde over-seer. I never did see no slaves sold. When we was sick dey give\r\nus medicine out of drug stores. De over-seer would git some coarse\r\ncotton cloth to make our work clothes out of and den he would make dem\r\nso narrow we couldn' hardly' walk.\r\n\r\n\"There was 1800 acres in Marster Slade's plantation, we got up at 5:00\r\no'clock in de mornin' and de field workers would quit after sun-down. We\r\ndidn' have no jails for slaves. We went to church with de white folks\r\nand there was a place in de back of de church for us to sit.\r\n\r\n\"I was jes' a child den and us chilluns would gather in de back yard and\r\nsing songs and play games and dance jigs. Song I 'member most is 'The\r\nDay is Past and Gone.'\r\n\r\n\"One time marster found out the over-seer was so mean to me, so he\r\ndischarged him and released me from duty for awhile.\r\n\r\n\"We never did wear shoes through de week but on Sunday we would dress up\r\nin our white cotton dresses and put on shoes.\r\n\r\n\"We wasn't taught to read or write. Our owner didn't think anything\r\nabout it. We had to work if there was work to be done. When we got\r\ncaught up den we could have time off. If any of us got sick our mistress\r\nwould 'tend to us herself. If she thought we was sick enough she would\r\ncall de white doctor.\r\n\r\n\"When de marster done told us we was free we jumped up and down and\r\nslapped our hands and shouted 'Glory to God!' Lord, child dat was one\r\nhappy bunch of niggers. Awhile after dat some of de slaves told marster\r\ndey wanted to stay on with him like dey had been but he told 'em no dey\r\ncouldn't, 'cause dey was free. He said he could use some of 'em but dey\r\nwould have to buy what dey got and he would have to pay 'em like men.\r\n\r\n\"When I was 'bout 18 years old I married John Barclay. I's had ten\r\nchillun and four gran'-chillun and now I lives by myself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420128\r\n\r\n\r\n     JOHN BARKER, age 84, Houston.\r\n\r\n     5 photographs marked _Green Cumby_ have been assigned to this\r\n     manuscript--the 'Green Cumby' photos are attached to the proper\r\n     manuscript and the five referred to above are probably pictures of\r\n     _John Barker_.\r\n\r\n\r\n     JOHN BARKER, age 84, was born near Cincinnati, Ohio, the property\r\n     of the Barker family, who moved to Missouri and later to Texas. He\r\n     and his wife live in a neat cottage in Houston, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was born a slave. I'm a Malagasser (Madagascar) nigger. I 'member all\r\n'bout dem times, even up in Ohio, though de Barkers brought me to Texas\r\nlater on. My mother and father was call Goodman, but dey died when I was\r\nlittle and Missy Barker raised me on de plantation down near Houston.\r\nDey was plenty of work and plenty of room.\r\n\r\n\"I 'member my grandma and grandpa. In dem days de horned toads runs over\r\nde world and my grandpa would gather 'em and lay 'em in de fireplace\r\ntill dey dried and roll 'em with bottles till dey like ashes and den rub\r\nit on de shoe bottoms. You see, when dey wants to run away, dat stuff\r\ndon't stick all on de shoes, it stick to de track. Den dey carries some\r\nof dat powder and throws it as far as dey could jump and den jump over\r\nit, and do dat again till dey use all de powder. Dat throwed de common\r\nhounds off de trail altogether. But dey have de bloodhounds, hell\r\nhounds, we calls 'em, and dey could pick up dat trail. Dey run my\r\ngrandpa over 100 mile and three or four days and nights and found him\r\nunder a bridge. What dey put on him was enough! I seen 'em whip runaway\r\nniggers till de blood run down dere backs and den put salt in de places.\r\n\r\n\"I 'spect dere was 'bout 40 or 50 acres in de plantation. Dey worked and\r\nworked and didn't have no dances or church. Dances nothin!\r\n\r\n\"My massa and missus house was nice, but it was a log house. They had\r\nbig fireplaces what took great big chunks of wood and kep' fire all\r\nnight. We lives in de back in a little bitty house like a chicken house.\r\nWe makes beds out of posts and slats across 'em and fills tow sacks with\r\nshucks in 'em for mattress and pillows.\r\n\r\n\"I seed slaves sold and they was yoked like steers and sold by pairs\r\nsometimes. Dey wasn't 'lowed to marry, 'cause they could be sold and it\r\nwasn't no use, but you could live with 'em.\r\n\r\n\"We used to eat possums and dese old-fashioned coons and ducks.\r\nSometimes we'd eat goats, too. We has plenty cornmeal and 'lasses and we\r\ngets milk sometimes, but we has no fine food, 'cept on Christmas, we\r\ngits some cake, maybe.\r\n\r\n\"My grandma says one day dat we all is free, but we stayed with Massa\r\nBarker quite a while. Dey pays us for workin' but it ain't much pay,\r\n'cause de war done took dere money and all. But they was good to us, so\r\nwe stayed.\r\n\r\n\"I was 'bout 20 when I marries de fust time. It was a big blow-out and I\r\nwas scared de whole time. First time I ever tackled marryin'. Dey had a\r\nbig paper sack of rice and throwed it all over her and I, enough rice to\r\nlast three or four days, throwed away jus' for nothin'. I had on a\r\nblack, alpaca suit with frock tail coat and, if I ain't mistaken, a\r\nright white shirt. My wife have a great train on her dress and one dem\r\nthings you call a wreath. I wore de loudest shoes we could find, what\r\nyou call patent leather.\r\n\r\n\"Dis here my third wife. We marries in Eagle Pass and comes up to de\r\nSeminole Reservation and works for de army till we goes to work for de\r\nPattersons, and we been here 23 years now.\r\n\r\n\"Ghosties? I was takin' care of a white man when he died and I seed\r\nsomething 'bout three feet high and black. I reckon I must have fainted\r\n'cause they has de doctor for me. And on dark nights I seed ghosties\r\nwhat has no head. Dey looks like dey wild and dey is all in different\r\nperformance. When I goin' down de road and feel a hot steam and look\r\nover my shoulder I can see 'em plain as you standin' dere.

A great-grandson climbed into\r\n     Harrison's lap during the interview, and his genial face lit up\r\n     with a smile. He chuckled as he told of his own boyhood days, and\r\n     appeared to enjoy reminiscing. At times he uses big words, some of\r\n     his own coining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I's 'mong de culls now, like a hoss what am too old. I's purty small\r\nyit when 'mancipation comes and didn't have no hard work. Old Massa have\r\nme and de other li'l niggers keep de stock out de fields. Us li'l\r\nboogers have to run and keep de cows out de corn and de cotton patch.\r\nDat ought to been 'nough to keep us out of debbilment.\r\n\r\n\"It come to pass my mammy work in de field.

One de farms in iron ore,\r\nwhat am red land, and de other in gray land, half sand and half black\r\ndirt.\r\n\r\n\"Us slaves live in pole houses and some in split log houses, with two\r\nrooms, one for to sleep in and one for to cook in. Day ain't\r\nno glass windows, jus' holes in de walls. Dere was jack beds to sleep\r\non, made out of poles. Dey has four legs and ain't nail to de walls.\r\n\r\n\"Old Massa he care for he hands purty well, considerin' everything. In\r\nginnin' time he 'low de women to pick up cotton from de ground and make\r\nmattresses and quilts. He make some cloth and buy some. A woman weave\r\nall de time and when de shickle jump out on de floor I picks it up. I\r\nused to could knit socks and I was jes' a li'l boy then, but I keep\r\neverything in 'membrance.\r\n\r\n\"Dey have some school and de chillen larnt readin' and writin', and\r\nmanners and behaviour, too. Sometime dey git de broke-down white man to\r\nbe teacher. But us didn't know much and it taken ten years or more after\r\nfreedom to git de black men de qualification way he could handle things.\r\n\r\n\"One time us boys git some watermillions out in de bresh and hit 'em or\r\ndrap 'em to break 'em open. Dere come massa and cotch us not workin',\r\nbut eatin' he watermillions. He tell my daddy to whip me. But lots of\r\ntimes when us sposed to mind de calves, us am out eatin' watermillions\r\nin de bresh. Den de calves git out and massa see dem run and cotch us.\r\n\r\n\"Old massa was kind and good, though. He have partiality 'bout him, and\r\nwouldn't whip nobody without de cause. He whip with de long, keen switch\r\nand it didn't bruise de back, but sho' did sting. When he git real mad,\r\nhe pull up you shirt and whip on de bare hide. One time he whippin' me\r\nand I busts de button off my shirt what he holdin' on to, and runs\r\naway. I tries to outrun him, and dat tickle him. I sho' give de ground\r\nfits with my feets.

When de weather am too cold, dey\r\nsometimes give us pants.\r\n\r\n\"De white preachers come round and preach. Dey have de tabernacle like a\r\narbor and cullud folks come from all round to hear de Gospel 'spounded.\r\nMost every farm have de cullud man larnin' to preach.

He's carryin' back some good for to make\r\nexchangement and dey pullin' up de box with pulley and rope and it fall\r\non him. De New Orleans folks say it am de accidentment, but de rest say\r\nde rope am cut. One of massa's old friends was Lawyer Brooks. He used to\r\nfirmanize de word.\r\n\r\n\"Massa have two boys, Mr. Jimmie and Li'l Ide and dey both goes to de\r\nwar. Li'l Ide, he go up in Arkansas and dey say when dat first cannon\r\nbusts at Li'l Rock, he starts runnin' and never stops till he gits back\r\nhome. I don't see how he could do dat, 'cause Li'l Rock am way far off,\r\nbut dat what dey say. Den de men comes to git 'serters and dey gits Li'l\r\nIde and takes him back. Mr. Jimmie, he didn't break de ranks. He stood\r\nhe ground.\r\n\r\n\"Mammy and dem tell me when war am over de boss and he wife, dey calls\r\nde slaves up in de bunch and tells 'em, 'You's free as I is. Keep on or\r\nquit, if you wants. You don't have to stay no further, you's free\r\ntoday.' Dat near June 19th, and all of 'em stays. Massa say, 'Go 'head\r\nand finish de crop and I feed you and pay you.' Dey all knowed when he\r\nkilt de hawgs us git plenty of meat. Dat young massa say all dat, 'cause\r\nold massa done git kilt.\r\n\r\n\"It's at Panola County where I first hears of de Klux. Dey call dem\r\nWhite Caps den. Dey move over in Panola County and ranges at de place\r\ncall Big Creek Merval by McFaddin Creek. Dey's purty rough. De\r\nlandowners tell dey niggers not to kill de White Caps but to scare dem\r\n'way. At night dey come knock and if you don't open it dey pry it open\r\nand run you out in de field. Dey run de niggers from Merryville round\r\nLongview. Dey some good men in de Klux and some bad men. But us work\r\nhard and go home and dey ain't bother us none.\r\n\r\n\"Dey used to be a nigger round dere, call Bandy Joe. He git kilt at\r\nNacogdoches fin'ly. He could turn into anything. De jedge of he parish\r\nwas Massa Lee and he say dey ought let Bandy Joe live, so dey could larn\r\nhe art. Dey done try cotch him de long time, and maybe be holdin' him\r\nand first thing they know he gone and dey left holdin' he coat. Dey\r\nshoot at him and not hurt him. He tell he wife dey ain't no kind bullet\r\ncan hurt him but de silver bullet.\r\n\r\n\"Dat Bandy Joe, he say he a spirit and a human both. Iffen he didn't\r\nwant you to see him you jus' couldn't see him. Lots of folks liked him.\r\nDe jedge say he wish he could'a been brung to town, so he could 'zamine\r\nhim 'bout he gifts. De jedge knowed Bandy Joe could dis'pear jus' like\r\nnothin', and he like to hear he quotation how he git out he skin. I'd\r\nlike to know dat myself.\r\n\r\n\"I 'magines I seed ghosties two, three times. I used to range round at\r\nnighttime. I rides through a old slavery field and de folks tell me,\r\n'Harry, you better be careful gwine 'cross dat old field. They's things\r\ndere what makes mules run 'way. One night it am late and my mule run\r\n'way. I make my mind I go back and see what he run from and somethin' am\r\nby de fence like de bear stand up straight. It stand dere 'bout fifteen\r\nminutes while I draws my best 'pinion of it. I didn't get any nearer dan\r\nto see it. A man down de road tell me de place am hanted and he dunno\r\nhow many wagons and mules git pull by dat thing at dat place.\r\n\r\n\"One time I's livin' 'nother place and it am 'twixt sundown and dusk. I\r\nhad a li'l boy 'hind me and I seed a big sow with no head comin' over de\r\nfence. My ma, she allus say what I see might be 'magination and to turn\r\nmy head and look 'gain and I does dat. But it still dere. Den I seed a\r\nhoss goin' down de road and he drag a chain, and cross de bridge and\r\nturn down de side road. But when I git to de side road I ain't seed no\r\nhoss or nothin'. I didn't say nothin' to de li'l boy 'hind me on de mule\r\ntill I gits most home, den asks him did he see anythin'. He say no. I\r\nwouldn't tell him 'fore dat, 'cause I 'fraid he light out and outrun me\r\nand I didn't want to be by myself with dem things. When I gits home and\r\ntell everybody, dey say dat a man name McCoy, what was kilt dere and I\r\nseed he spirit.\r\n\r\n\"I's 'bout twenty-one when I marries Mandy Green. Us has twelve chillen,\r\nand a world of grandchillen. I travels all over Louisiana and Texas in\r\nmy time, and come here three year ago. My son he work in de box fact'ry\r\nhere, and he git a bodily injurement while he workin' and die, and I\r\ncome here to de burial and I been here ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420269\r\n\r\n\r\n     FRANK BELL, 86, was a slave of Johnson Bell, who ran a saloon in\r\n     New Orleans. Frank lives in Madisonville, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was owned by Johnson Bell and born in New Orleans, in Louisiana.\r\n'Cordin' to the bill of sale, I'm eighty-six years old, and my master\r\nwas a Frenchman and was real mean to me. He run saloon and kept bad\r\nwomen. I don't know nothing 'bout my folks, if I even had any, 'cept\r\nmama. They done tell me she was a bad woman and a French Creole.\r\n\r\n\"I worked 'round master's saloon, kep' everything cleaned up after\r\nthey'd have all night drinkin' parties, men and women. I earned nickels\r\nto tip off where to go, so's they could sow wild oats. I buried the\r\nnickels under rocks. If master done cotch me with money, he'd take it\r\nand beat me nearly to death. All I had to eat was old stuff those people\r\nleft, all scraps what was left.\r\n\r\n\"One time some bad men come to master's and gits in a shootin' scrape\r\nand they was two men kilt. I sho' did run. But master cotch me and make\r\nme take them men to the river and tie a weight on them, so they'd sink\r\nand the law wouldn't git him.\r\n\r\n\"The clothes I wore was some master's old ones. They allus had holes in\r\nthem. Master he stay drunk nearly all time and was mean to his slave.\r\nI'm the only one he had, and didn't cost him nothing. He have bill of\r\nsale made, 'cause the law say he done stole me when I'm small child.\r\nMaster kept me in chains sometimes. He shot several men.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't have no quarters but stays 'round the place and throw old sack\r\ndown and lay there and sleep. I'm 'fraid to run, 'cause master say he'd\r\nhunt me and kill nigger.\r\n\r\n\"When I's 'bout seventeen I marries a gal while master on drunk spell.\r\nMaster he run her off, and I slips off at night to see her, but he finds\r\nit out. He takes a big, long knife and cuts her head plumb off, and ties\r\na great, heavy weight to her and makes me throw her in the river. Then\r\nhe puts me in chains and every night he come give me a whippin', for\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\n\"When war come, master swear he not gwine fight, but the Yankees they\r\ncaptures New Orleans and throws master in a pen and guards him. He gets\r\na chance and 'scapes.\r\n\r\n\"When war am over he won't free me, says I'm valuable to him in his\r\ntrade. He say, 'Nigger, you's suppose to be free but I'll pay you a\r\ndollar a week and iffen you runs off I'll kill you.' So he makes me do\r\nlike befo' the war, but give me 'bout a dollar a month, 'stead week.\r\n\r\n\"He say I cost more'n I'm worth, but he won't let me go. Times I don't\r\nknow why I didn't die befo' I'm growed, sleepin' on the ground, winter\r\nand summer, rain and snow. But not much snow there.\r\n\r\n\"Master helt me long years after the war. If anybody git after him, he\r\ntold them I stay 'cause I wants to stay, but told me if I left he'd kill\r\nhim 'nother nigger. I stayed till he gits in a drunk brawl one night\r\nwith men and women and they gits to shootin' and some kilt. Master got\r\nkilt. Then I'm left to live or die, so I wanders from place to place. I\r\nnearly starved to death befo' I'd leave New Orleans, 'cause I couldn't\r\nthink master am dead and I'm 'fraid. Finally I gits up nerve to leave\r\ntown, and stays the first night in white man's barn. I never slep'.\r\nEvery time I hears something, I jumps up and master be standin' there,\r\nlookin' at me, but soon's I git up he'd leave. Next night I slep' out in\r\na hay field, and master he git right top of a tree and start hollerin at\r\nme. I never stays in that place. I gits gone from that place. I gits\r\nback to town fast as my legs carry me.\r\n\r\n\"Then I gits locked up in jail. I don't know what for, never did know.\r\nOne the men says to me to come with him and takes me to the woods and\r\ngives me an ax. I cuts rails till I nearly falls, all with chain locked\r\n'round feet, so I couldn't run off. He turns me loose and I wanders\r\n'gain. Never had a home. Works for men long 'nough to git fifty, sixty\r\ncents, then starts roamin' 'gain, like a stray dog like.\r\n\r\n\"After long time I marries Feline Graham. Then I has a home and we has a\r\nwhite preacher marry us. We has one boy and he farms and I lives with\r\nhim. I worked at sawmill and farms all my life, but never could make\r\nmuch money.\r\n\r\n\"You know, the nigger was wild till the white man made what he has out\r\nof the nigger. He done ed'cate them real smart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420193\r\n\r\n\r\n     Aunt VIRGINIA BELL, 1205 Ruthven St., Houston, was born a slave\r\n     near Opelousas, Louisiana, on the plantation of Thomas Lewis.\r\n     Although she remembers being told she was born on Christmas Day,\r\n     she does not know the year, but says she guesses she is about 88\r\n     years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, suh, the fus' question you ask me, 'bout how old I is, I don'\r\nknow 'zactly. You see it ain't like things is today. The young folks can\r\ntell you their 'zact age and everything, but in those days we didn' pay\r\nmuch 'tention to such things. But I knows I was bo'n in slavery times\r\nand my pappy tol' me I was bo'n on a Christmas Day, but didn' 'member\r\njus' what year.\r\n\r\n\"We was owned by Massa Lewis. Thomas Lewis was his name, and he was a\r\nUnited States lawyer. I ain't gwineter talk 'gainst my white folks like\r\nsome cullud folks do, 'cause Massa Lewis was a mighty fine man and so\r\nwas Miss Mary, and they treated us mighty good.\r\n\r\n\"Massa had a big plantation near Opelousas and I was bo'n there. I\r\n'member the neighbor folks used to bring their cotton to the gin on his\r\nfarm for ginnin' and balin'. My mother's name was Della. That was all,\r\njus' Della. My pappy's name was Jim Blair. Both of them was from\r\nVirginny, but from diff'rent places, and was brought to Louisiana by\r\nnigger traders and sold to Massa Lewis. I know my pappy was lots older\r\nthan my mother and he had a wife and five chillen back in Virginny and\r\nhad been sold away from them out here. Then he and my mother started a\r\nfamily out here. I don' know what become of his family back in Virginny,\r\n'cause when we was freed he stayed with us.\r\n\r\n\"When I got old enough I was housegirl and used to carry notes for Miss\r\nMary to the neighbors and bring back answers. Miss Mary would say, 'Now,\r\nVirginny, you take this note to sech and sech place and be sure and be\r\nback in sech and sech time,' and I allus was.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Lewis had four or five families of us slaves, but we used to have\r\nsome fun after work and us young folks would skip rope and play ring\r\ngames. Durin' week days the field hands would work till the sun was jus'\r\ngoin' down and then the overseer would holler 'all right' and that was\r\nthe signal to quit. All hands knocked off Sat'day noon.\r\n\r\n\"We didn' have no schoolin' or preachin'. Only the white folks had them,\r\nbut sometimes on Sundays we'd go up to the house and listen to the white\r\nfolks singin'.\r\n\r\n\"Iffen any of the slave hands wanted to git married, Massa Lewis would\r\ngit them up to the house after supper time, have the man and woman jine\r\nhands and then read to them outen a book. I guess it was the Scriptures.\r\nThen he'd tell 'em they was married but to be ready for work in the\r\nmornin'. Massa Lewis married us 'cordin' to Gospel.\r\n\r\n\"Massa used to feed us good, too, and we had plenty clothes. Iffen we\r\ngot took sick, we had doctor treatment, too. Iffen a hand took sick in\r\nthe field with a misery, they was carried to their quarters and Massa or\r\nMiss Mary would give them a dose of epecac and make them vomit and would\r\nsen' for the doctor. They wouldn' fool none iffen one of us took sick,\r\nbut would clean us out and take care of us till we was well.\r\n\r\n\"There was mighty little whippin' goin' on at our place, 'cause Massa\r\nLewis and Miss Mary treated us good. They wasn't no overseer goin' to\r\nwhip, 'cause Massa wouldn' 'low him to. Le's see, I don' rec'lec' more\r\nthan two whippin's I see anyone git from Massa, and that has been so\r\nlong ago I don' rec'lec' what they was for.\r\n\r\n\"When the War done come 'long it sho' changed things, and we heerd this\r\nand that, but we didn' know much what it was about. Then one day Massa\r\nLewis had all the wagons loaded with food and chairs and beds and other\r\nthings from the house and our quarters, and I heerd him say we was\r\nmovin' to Polk County, way over in Texas. I know it took us a long time\r\nto git there, and when we did I never see so much woods. It sho' was\r\ndiff'rent from the plantation.\r\n\r\n\"I had to work in the fields, same as the res', and we stayed there\r\nthree years and made three crops of cotton, but not so much as on our\r\nold place, 'cause there wasn't so much clearin'. Then one day Massa\r\nLewis tol' us we was free, jus' as free as he was--jus' like you take\r\nthe bridle offen a hoss and turn him loose. We jus' looked 'roun as\r\niffen we hadn' good sense. We didn' have nothin' nor nowhere to go, and\r\nMassa Lewis say iffen we finish makin' de crop, he would take us back to\r\nOpelousas and give us a place to stay and feed us. So after pickin' we\r\ngoes back and when we git there we sees where those rascal Yankees\r\n'stroyed everything--houses burned, sugar kettles broke up. It looked\r\nmighty bad.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Lewis hadn' no money, but he fixed us up a place to stay and give\r\nus what he could to eat, but things was mighty hard for a while. I know\r\npappy used to catch rabbits and take them to town and sell them or trade\r\nthem for somethin' to eat, and you know that wasn't much, 'cause you\r\ncan't git much for a little ol' rabbit.\r\n\r\n\"Then the Provo' Marshal, that was his name, give us a order for things\r\nto put in a crop with and to live till we made the crop. 'Course, I\r\nguess we wasn' as bad off as some, 'cause white folks knew we was Massa\r\nLewis' folks and didn' bother us none.\r\n\r\nThen I got married to John Bell, and it was a scripture weddin', too. He\r\ndied 28 years ago, but I has stayed married to him ever since. We had\r\nthirteen chillen, but they is all dead now 'cept four, but they was\r\nraised up right and they is mighty good to they ol' mammy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420114\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Edgar and Minerva Bendy]\r\n\r\n\r\n     EDGAR BENDY, 90 odd years, was the slave of Henry Bendy, of\r\n     Woodville, Texas, has to make an effort to remember and is forced\r\n     to seek aid from his wife, Minerva, at certain points in his story.\r\n     Edgar has lived in Woodville all his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I's a good size' boy when de war gwine on and I seed de soldiers come\r\nright here in Woodville.

I 'member jus' as good as yesterday wigglin' my toes in\r\ndat sandy road and runnin' 'way to de grits mill where dey grind de\r\nmeal. Dat have de big water wheel dat sing and squeak as it go 'round.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Mary, she make all us little chillen sleep in de heat of de day\r\nunder de big, spreadin' oak tree in de yard. My mama have 17 chillen.\r\nHer name Dollie and my daddy name Herd.\r\n\r\n\"I's jus' a little chile in dem days and I stay in de house with de\r\nwhite folks. Dey raise me a pet in de family. Missus Goolsby, she have\r\ntwo gals and dey give me to de oldest. When she die dey put me in de bed\r\nwith her but iffen I knowed she dyin' dey wouldn't been able to cotch\r\nme. She rub my head and tell her papa and mama, 'I's gwine 'way but I\r\nwants you promise you ain't never whip my little nigger.' Dey never did.\r\n\r\n\"I's jus' 'bout five year old when us make de trip to Texas. Us come\r\nright near Woodville and make de plantation. It a big place and dey\r\nraise corn and cotton and cane. We makes our own sugar and has many as\r\nsix kettle on de furnace at one time. Dey raise dey tobacco, too. I's\r\nsick and a old man he say he make me tobacco medicine and dey dry de\r\nleafs and make dem sweet like sugar and feed me like candy.\r\n\r\n\"I 'member old marster say war broke out and Capt. Collier's men was\r\na-drillin' right dere south of Woodville. All de wives and chillen watch\r\ndem drill. Dey was lots of dem, but I couldn't count. De whole shebang\r\nfrom de town go watch dem.\r\n\r\n\"Four of the Goolsby boys goes to dat war and dey call John and Ziby and\r\nZabud and Addison. Zabud, he git wounded, no he git kilt, and Addison he\r\ngit wounded. I worry den, 'cause I ain't see no reason for dem to have\r\nto die.\r\n\r\n\"After us free dey turn us loose in de woods and dat de bad time, 'cause\r\nmost us didn't know where to turn. I wasn't raise to do nothin' and I\r\ndidn't know how. Dey didn't even give us a hoecake or a slice of bacon.\r\n\r\n\"I's a June bride 59 year ago when I git married. De old white Baptist\r\npreacher name Blacksheer put me and dat nigger over dere, Edgar Bendy,\r\ntogedder and us been togedder ever since. Us never have chick or chile.\r\nI's such a good nuss I guess de Lawd didn't want me to have none of my\r\nown, so's I could nuss all de others and I 'spect I's nussed most de\r\nwhite chillen and cullud, too, here in Woodville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420177\r\n\r\n\r\n     SARAH BENJAMIN, 82, was born a slave of the Gilbert family, in\r\n     Clavin Parish, Louisiana. In 1867 she married Cal Benjamin and they\r\n     settled in Corsicana, Texas, where Sarah now lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I is Sarah Benjamin and is 82 year old, 'cause my mammy told me I's\r\nborn in 1855 in Clavin Parish in Louisiana. Her name was Fannie and my\r\npappy's name Jack Callahan. There was jus' three of us chillen and I's\r\nde oldest.\r\n\r\n\"Marse Gilbert was tol'able good to we'uns, and give us plenty to eat.\r\nHe had a smokehouse big as a church and it was full, and in de big\r\nkitchen we all et, chillen and all. De grown folks et first and den de\r\nchillen. Did we have plenty of possums and fish by de barrels full! All\r\ndis was cooked in de racks over de fireplace and it were good.\r\n\r\n\"Our clothes was all homespun and de shoes made by de shoemaker. Old\r\nmarse wanted all us to go to church and if dey didn't have shoes dey\r\nhave something like de moccasin.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how many slaves there was, but it was a lot, maybe 60 or\r\n70. Dey worked hard every day 'cept Sunday. Iffen they was bad they\r\nmight git whuppin's, but not too hard, not to de blood. Iffen dey was\r\nstill bad, dey puts chains on dem and puts dem in de stocks, 'cause\r\nthere wasn't no jail there.\r\n\r\n\"Once when I's little, marse stripped me stark modern naked and puts me\r\non de block, but he wouldn't sell me, 'cause he was bid only $350.00 and\r\nhe say no, 'cause I was good and fat.\r\n\r\n\"Dey didn't larn us nothin' and iffen you did larn to write, you better\r\nkeep it to yourse'f, 'cause some slaves got de thumb or finger cut off\r\nfor larnin' to write. When de slaves come in from de fields dey didn't\r\nlarn nothin', they jus' go to bed, 'lessen de moonshine nights come and\r\ndey could work in de tobacco patch. De marster give each one de little\r\ntobacco patch and iffen he raised more'n he could use he could sell it.\r\n\r\n\"On Christmas we all has de week vacation and maybe de dance. We allus\r\nhave de gran' dinner on dat day, and no whuppin's. But dey couldn't\r\nleave de plantation without de pass, even on Christmas.\r\n\r\n\"De women had to run de gin in de daytime and de man at night. Dey fed\r\nde old gin from baskets and my mammy fed from dose baskets all day with\r\nde high fever and died dat night. She wouldn't tell de marster she sick,\r\nfer fear she have to take de quinine.\r\n\r\n\"De day we was freed, de slaves jus' scattered, 'cepting me. Missy\r\nGilbert says I wasn't no slave no more but I had to stay and he'p her\r\nfor my board 'till I's grown. I stayed 'till I was 'bout 16, den I runs\r\naway and marries Cal Benjamin, and we comes to Texas. Cal and me has six\r\nchillen, but he died 'fore dey was grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420023\r\n\r\n\r\n     JACK BESS was born near Goliad, Texas in 1854, a slave of Steve\r\n     Bess who was a rancher. He worked with stock as a very young boy\r\n     and this was his duty during and after the Civil War, as he\r\n     remained with his boss for three years after emancipation. He then\r\n     came to old Ben Ficklin four miles south of the present San Angelo,\r\n     Texas, when it was the county seat of Tom Green County and before\r\n     there was a San Angelo. He continued his work on ranches here and\r\n     has never done any other kind of work. For the past several years\r\n     he has been very feeble and has made his home with a daughter in\r\n     San Angelo, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nJack who was assisted out of bed and dressed by his grandson, hobbled in\r\non his cane and said, \"I was jes' a small boy workin' on de ranch when I\r\nhear talk 'bout conscription' de men for de war what was agoin' to set\r\nde slaves free. We didn' know hardly what dey was a talkin' 'bout 'cause\r\nwe knowed dat would be too good to be true. I jes' keeps on workin' wid\r\nmy hosses and my cattle (dere wasn't no sheep den) jes' like dere wasn't\r\nno war, 'cause dat was all I ever knowed how to do.\r\n\r\n\"Our ole marster, he wasn't so very mean to us, course he whips us once\r\nand awhile but dat wasn't like de slave holders what had dem colored\r\ndrivers. Dey sho' was rough on de slaves. I's been told lots 'bout de\r\nchains and de diffe'nt punishments but our treatment wasn't so bad. Our\r\nbeds was pretty good when we uses dem. Lots of de time we jes' sleeps on\r\nde groun', 'specially in summer.\r\n\r\n\"Our log huts was comfortable and we had some kind of floors in all of\r\ndem. Some was plank and some was poles but dat was better den de dirt\r\nfloors some cabins have.\r\n\r\n\"De eats we have was jes' good eats, lots of meats and vegetables and de\r\nlike; 'possum and coon and beef and pork all cooked good. Our clothes\r\nwas jes' home spun like all de others.\r\n\r\n\"We didn' have such a big ranch and not many slaves but we all gits\r\nalong. We learns a little 'bout readin' and writin'.\r\n\r\n\"I don't 'member any camp meetin's 'til after de war. We had a few den\r\nand on Christmas times we jes' tears up de country. Lawdy! Lawd! Dat\r\nfiddlin' went on all night, and we dance awhile den lay down and sleeps,\r\nden gits up and dances some mo'e. We would have big cakes and\r\neverything good to eat.\r\n\r\n\"When we gits sick dey jes' gives us some kind of tea, mostly made from\r\nweeds. Mos' of de time we gits well.\r\n\r\n\"When de news comes dat we was free our boss, he say, 'You free now.'\r\nCourse we was glad but we didn' know nothin' to do but jes' stay on\r\ndere, and we did 'bout three years and de boss pays us a little by de\r\nmonth for our work.\r\n\r\n\"I's lef' dere den and comes to old Ben Ficklin to work on a ranch. Dat\r\nwas before dere was any San Angelo, Texas. I's been here ever since,\r\njes' a workin' from one ranch to another long as I was able. Now I's\r\njes' stayin' 'round wid my chillun and dey takes good care of me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420170\r\n\r\n\r\n     ELLEN BETTS, 118 N. Live Oak St., Houston, Texas, is 84. All of her\r\n     people and their masters came from Virginia and settled in\r\n     Louisiana about 1853. Her grandparents belonged to the Green family\r\n     and her parents, Charity and William Green, belonged to Tolas\r\n     Parsons. Ellen lives with friends who support her. Her sole\r\n     belonging is an old trunk and she carries the key on a string\r\n     around her neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I got borned on de Bayou Teche, clost to Opelousas. Dat in St. Mary's\r\nParish, in Louisiana, and I belonged to Tolas Parsons, what had 'bout\r\n500 slaves, countin' de big ones and de little ones, and he had God know\r\nwhat else. When my eyes jes' barely fresh open, Marse Tolas die and will\r\nde hull lot of us to he brother, William Tolas. And I tells you dat\r\nMarse William am de greates' man what ever walk dis earth. Dat's de\r\ntruth. I can't lie on him when de pore man's in he grave.\r\n\r\n\"When a whuppin' got to be done, old Marse do it heself. He don't 'low\r\nno overseer to throw he gals down and pull up dere dress and whup on\r\ndere bottoms like I hear tell some of 'em do. Was he still livin' I\r\n'spect one part of he hands be with him today. I knows I would.\r\n\r\n\"When us niggers go down de road folks say, 'Dem's Parson's niggers.\r\nDon't hit one dem niggers for God's sake, or Parsons sho' eat your\r\njacket up.'\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Rachel what cook in de big house for Miss Cornelia had four\r\nyoung'uns and dem chillen fat and slick as I ever seen. All de niggers\r\nhave to stoop to Aunt Rachel jes' like dey curtsy to Missy. I mind de\r\ntime her husband, Uncle Jim, git mad and hit her over de head with de\r\npoker. A big knot raise up on Aunt Rachel's head and when Marse 'quire\r\n'bout it, she say she done bump de head. She dassn't tell on Uncle Jim\r\nor Marse sho' beat him. Marse sho' proud dem black, slick chillen of\r\nRachels. You couldn't find a yaller chile on he place. He sho' got no\r\nuse for mixin' black and white.\r\n\r\n\"Marse William have de pretties' place up and down dat bayou, with de\r\nfine house and fine trees and sech. From where we live it's five mile to\r\nCenterville one way and five mile to Patterson t'other. Dey hauls de\r\nlumber from one place or t'other to make wood houses for de slaves.\r\nSometime Marse buy de furniture and sometime de carpenter make it.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Sidney was Marse's first wife and he had six boys by her. Den he\r\nmarry de widow Cornelius and she give him four boys. With ten chillen\r\nspringin' up quick like dat and all de cullud chillen comin' 'long fast\r\nas pig litters, I don't do nothin' all my days, but nuss, nuss, nuss. I\r\nnuss so many chillen it done went and stunted my growth and dat's why I\r\nain't nothin' but bones to dis day.\r\n\r\n\"When de cullud women has to cut cane all day till midnight come and\r\nafter, I has to nuss de babies for dem and tend de white chillen, too.\r\nSome dem babies so fat and big I had to tote de feet while 'nother gal\r\ntote de head. I was sech a li'l one, 'bout seven or eight year old. De\r\nbig folks leave some toddy for colic and cryin' and sech and I done\r\ndrink de toddy and let de chillen have de milk. I don't know no better.\r\nLawsy me, it a wonder I ain't de bigges' drunker in dis here country,\r\ncountin' all de toddy I done put in my young belly!\r\n\r\n\"When late of night come, iffen dem babies wake up and bawl, I set up a\r\nscreech and out-screech dem till dey shut dere mouth. De louder day bawl\r\nde louder I bawl. Sometime when Marse hear de babies cry, he come down\r\nand say, 'Why de chillen cry like dat, Ellen?' I say, 'Marse, I git so\r\nhongry and tired I done drink de milk up.' When I talk sassy like dat,\r\nMarse jes' shake he finger at me, 'cause he knowed I's a good one and\r\ndon't let no little mite starve.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody ever hit me a lick. Marse allus say bein' mean to de young'uns\r\nmake dem mean when dey grows up and nobody gwineter buy a mean nigger.\r\nMarse don't even let de chillen go to de big cane patch. He plant little\r\nbitty patches close to de house and each li'l nigger have a patch and he\r\nwork it till it got growed. Marse have de house girls make popcorn for\r\n'em and candy.\r\n\r\n\"I nuss de sick folks too. Sometime I dose with Blue Mass pills and\r\nsometime Dr. Fawcett leave rhubarb and ipicac and calomel and castor oil\r\nand sech. Two year after de war, I git marry and git chillen of my own\r\nand den I turn into de wet nuss. I wet nuss de white chillen and black\r\nchillen, like dey all de same color. Sometime I have a white'un pullin'\r\nde one side and a black one de other.\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to git de papers for midwifin' but, law, I don't never have no\r\ntime for larnin' in slave time. If Marse cotch a paper in you hand he\r\nsho' whop you. He don't 'low no bright niggers 'round, he sell 'em\r\nquick. He allus say, 'Book larnin' don't raise no good sugar cane.' De\r\nonly larnin' he 'low was when dey larn de cullud chillen de Methodist\r\ncatechism. De only writin' a nigger ever git, am when he git born or\r\nmarry or die, den Marse put de name in de big book.\r\n\r\nLaw, I 'lect de time Marse marry Miss Cornelia. He went on de mail boat\r\nand brung her from New Orleans. She de pretties' woman in de world\r\nalmost, 'ceptin' she have de bigges' mouth I nearly ever seed. He brung\r\nher up to de house and all de niggers and boys and girls and cats and\r\ndogs and sech come and salute her. Dere she stand on de gallery, with a\r\npurty white dress on with red stripes runnin' up and down. Marse say to\r\nher, 'Honey, see all de black folks, dey 'longs to you now.' She wave to\r\nus and smile on us and nex' day she give her weddin' dress to my ma. Dat\r\nde fines' dress I ever seen. It was purple and green silk and all de\r\nnigger gals wear dat dress when dey git marry. My sister Sidney wore it\r\nand Sary and Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Cornelia was de fines' woman in de world. Come Sunday mornin' she\r\ndone put a bucket of dimes on de front gallery and stand dere and throw\r\ndimes to de nigger chillen jes' like feedin' chickens. I sho' right here\r\nto test'fy, 'cause I's right dere helpin' grab. Sometime she done put da\r\nwashtub of buttermilk on de back gallery and us chillen bring us gourds\r\nand dip up dat good, old buttermilk till it all git drunk up. Sometime\r\nshe fotch bread and butter to de back gallery and pass it out when it\r\ndon't even come mealtime.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Cornelia set my ma to cuttin' patterns and sewin' right away. She\r\ngive all de women a bolt or linsey to make clothes and ma cut de\r\npattern. Us all have de fine drawers down to de ankle, buttoned with\r\npretty white buttons on de bottom. Lawsy, ma sho' cut a mite of drawers,\r\nwith sewin' for her eleven gals and four boys, too. In de summertime we\r\nall git a bolt of blue cloth and white tape for trimmin', to make Sunday\r\ndresses. For de field, all de niggers git homespun what you make jumpers\r\nout of. I 'lect how Marse say, 'Don't go into de field dirty Monday\r\nmornin'. Scrub youself and put on de clean jumper.'\r\n\r\n\"Marse sho' good to dem gals and bucks what cuttin' de cane. When dey\r\ngit done makin' sugar, he give a drink call 'Peach 'n Honey' to de women\r\nfolk and whiskey and brandy to de men. And of all de dancin' and\r\ncaperin' you ever seen! My pa was fiddler and we'd cut de pigeon wing\r\nand cut de buck and every other kind of dance. Sometime pa git tired and\r\nsay he ain't gwineter play no more and us gals git busy and pop him corn\r\nand make candy, so to 'tice him to play more.\r\n\r\n\"Marse sho' turn over in he grave did he know 'bout some dat 'lasses.\r\nDem black boys don't care. I seen 'em pull rats out de sugar barrel and\r\ndey taste de sugar and say, 'Ain't nothin' wrong with dat sugar. It\r\nstill sweet.' One day a pert one pull a dead scorpion out de syrup\r\nkettle and he jes' laugh and say, 'Marse don't want waste none dis\r\nsyrup,' and he lick de syrup right off dat scorpion's body and legs.\r\n\r\n\"Lawsy me, I seen thousands and thousands sugar barrels and kettles of\r\nsyrup in my day. Lawd knows how much cane old Marse have. To dem cuttin'\r\nde cane it don't seem so much, but to dem what work hour in, hour out,\r\ndem sugar cane fields sho' stretch from one end de earth to de other.\r\nMarse ship hogs and hogs of sugar down de bayou. I seen de river boats\r\ngo down with big signs what say, 'Buy dis here 'lasses' on de side. And\r\nhe raise a world of rice and 'taters and corn and peanuts, too.\r\n\r\n\"When de work slight, us black folks sho have de balls and dinners and\r\nsech. We git all day to barbecue meat down on de bayou and de white\r\nfolks come down and eat long side de cullud.\r\n\r\n\"When a black gal marry, Marse marry her hisself in de big house. He\r\nmarry 'em Saturday, so dey git Sunday off, too. One time de river boat\r\ncome bearin' de license for niggers to git marry with. Marse chase 'em\r\noff and say, 'Don't you come truckin' no no-count papers roun' my\r\nniggers. When I marry 'em, dey marry as good as if de Lawd God hisself\r\nmarry 'em and it don't take no paper to bind de tie.' Marse don't stand\r\nno messin' 'round, neither. A gal have to be of age and ask her pa and\r\nma and Marse and Missy, and if dey 'gree, dey go ahead and git marry.\r\nMarse have de marry book to put de name down.\r\n\r\n\"One time Marse take me 'long to help tote some chillen. He done write\r\nup to Virginny for to buy fresh hands. Dey a old man dat hobble 'long de\r\nroad and de chillen start to throw rocks and de old man turn 'round to\r\none prissy one and say, 'Go on, young'un, you'll be where dogs can't\r\nbark at you tomorrow. Nex' mornin' us cookin' in de kitchen and all a\r\nsudden dat li'l boy jes' crumple up dead on de floor. Law, we's scairt.\r\nNobody ever bother dat old man no more, for he sho' lay de evil finger\r\non you.\r\n\r\n\"Marse's brother, Conrad, what was a widdyman, come to live on de\r\nplantation and he had a li'l gal 'bout eight year old. One day she in de\r\nplum orchard playin' with a rattlesnake and Marse Conrad have de fit. De\r\nli'l gal won't let nobody hurt dat snake and she play with him. He won't\r\nbite her. She keeps him 'bout three year, and she'd rub and grease him.\r\nOne day he got sick and dey give him some brandy, but he die and old Doc\r\npickle him in de bottle of brandy. Dat gal git so full of grief dey take\r\nher to de infirm'ry in New Orleans and den one day she up and die.\r\n\r\n\"Dat snake ain't all what Doc Fawcett pickle. A slave woman give birth\r\nto a baby gal what have two faces with a strip of hair runnin' 'tween.\r\nOld Doc Fawcett pickle it in de jar of brandy. Old doc start to court\r\nMiss Cornelia when Marse die, but she don't have none of him and he\r\ndone went straight 'way and kill hisself.\r\n\r\n\"One day a li'l man come ridin' by on a li'l dun hoss so fast you\r\ncouldn't see dat hoss tail a-switchin'. He whoopin' and hollerin'. Us\r\nniggers 'gun whoop and holler, too. Den first thing you know de Yanks\r\nand de Democrats 'gun to fight right dere. Dey a high old mountain front\r\nMarse's house and de Yanks 'gun pepper cannon ball down from de top dat\r\nhill. De war met right dere and dem Yanks and Democrats fit for\r\ntwenty-four hours straight runnin'.\r\n\r\n\"When de bullets starts rainin' down, Marse call us and slip us way back\r\ninto de woods, where it so black and deep. Next day, when de fight over,\r\nMarse come out with great big wagons piles full of mess-poke for us to\r\neat. Dat what us call hog meat. Us sho' glad to 'scape from de Yankees.\r\n\r\n\"When us driv back to de plantation, sech a sight I never seen. Law, de\r\nthings I can tell. Dem Yanks have kilt men and women. I seed babies pick\r\nup from de road with dere brains bust right out. One old man am drawin'\r\nwater and a cannon ball shoots him right in de well. Dey draws him up\r\nwith de fishin' line. Dey's a old sugar boat out on de bayou with blood\r\nand sugar runnin' long side de busted barrels. 'Lasses run in de bayou\r\nand blood run in de ditches. Marse have de great big orchard on de road\r\nand it wipe clean as de whistle. Bullets wipe up everythin' and bust dat\r\nsugar cane all to pieces. De house sot far back and 'scape de bullets,\r\nbut, law, de time dey have!\r\n\r\n\"Dey's awful, awful times after dat. A old cotton dress cost five\r\ndollars and a pound of coffee cost five dollars and a pint cup flour\r\ncost six bits. De Yanks 'round all de time and one day they comes right\r\nin de house where Miss Cornelia eatin' her dinner. Dey march 'round de\r\ntable, jes' scoopin' up meat and 'taters and grabbin' cornpone right and\r\nleft. Miss Cornelia don't say a word, jes' smile sweet as honey-cake. I\r\nreckon dem sojers might a took de silver and sech only she charm 'em by\r\nbein' so quiet and ladylike. First thing you know dem sojers curtsy to\r\nMissy and take dereself right out de door and don't come back.\r\n\r\n\"Den it seem like Marse have all de trouble in de world. He boy, Ned,\r\ndie in de war and William, what name for he pa, drink bad all de time.\r\nAnd after de war dem Ku Kluxers what wear de false faces try to tinker\r\nwith Marse's niggers. One day Uncle Dave start to town and a Kluxer ask\r\nhim where am he pass. Dat Kluxer clout him but Uncle Dave outrun him in\r\nde cane. Marse grab de hoss and go 'rest dat man and Marse a jedge and\r\nhe make dat man pay de fine for hittin' Uncle Dave. After dey hears of\r\ndat, dem old poky faces sho' scairt of old Marse and dey git out from\r\nOpelousas and stays out. When me and my husband, John, come to Texas de\r\nfolks say dat Louisiana masters de meanes' in de world and I say right\r\nback at 'em dat dey is good and mean in every spot of de earth. What\r\nmore, de Louisiana masters free dere niggers a year befo' any Texas\r\nnigger git free.\r\n\r\n\"When 'mancipation come, Marse git on de big block and say, 'You all is\r\nas free as I is, standin' right here. Does you want to stay with me, you\r\ncan, and I'll pay you for de work.' All de niggers cheer and say dey\r\nwant to stay, but Marse die not long after and all us niggers scatter.\r\n\r\n\"I sho' 'lect dat day old Marse die. He won't die till ma gits there. He\r\nkeep sayin', \"Where's Charity, tell Charity to come.\" Dey fotch ma from\r\nde cane patch and she hold Marse's hand till he die. Us niggers went to\r\nde graveyard and us sho' cry over old Marse.\r\n\r\n\"Marse's brother, Goldham, carries all he hands back to de free country\r\nto turn 'em loose. He say de free country am de ones what's yellin'\r\n'bout slave times, so dey could jes' take care of de niggers. Marse\r\nGoldham so big dat when he stand in de door you couldn't git by him,\r\n'thout he stand sideways.\r\n\r\n\"Law, times ain't like dey was in slave days. All my ten chillen is dead\r\nand my old man gone, and now I reckon my time 'bout 'rive. All I got to\r\ndo now am pray de Lawd to keep me straight, den when de great day come,\r\nI can march de road to glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420125\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Charlotte Beverley]\r\n\r\n\r\n     CHARLOTTE BEVERLY was born a slave to Captain Pankey's wife, in\r\n     Montgomery County, Texas.

Pankey.\r\n\r\n\"There was 'bout forty niggers, big and little, on the plantation. Lawd,\r\nthey was good to us. Us didn' know nothin' 'bout bad times and cutting\r\nand whipping and slashing. I had to work in the house and I 'member one\r\nthing I has to do was scrub Mistus' gol' snuffbox twict a week. She kep'\r\nsweet, Scotch snuff and sometimes I takes a pinch out.\r\n\r\n\"We used to go to the white folks church and if us couldn' git in we'd\r\nstand round by the door and sing. Mistus wouldn' 'low us dance on the\r\nplace but they give us pass to go to dance on nex' plantation, where my\r\ndaddy live.\r\n\r\n\"Every year they have big Christmas dinner and ham and turkey\r\nand allus feed us good. Us have Christmas party and sing songs. That was\r\nsweet music.\r\n\r\n\"Marster have a lovely house, all ceiled and plastered. It was a log\r\nhouse but it was make all beautiful inside with mirrors and on the board\r\nwas lots of silver and china and silver spoons with the gol' linin's and\r\npart of my job was to keep 'em sparklin'.\r\n\r\n\"Folks in them times cooks in the fireplace and my auntie, she cook. She\r\nmake 'simmon bread and 'tater pone and the like. She mash up 'simmons\r\nwith butter and pour sweet milk and flour in it. That make good 'simmon\r\nbread. We has skillets what was flat and deep and set on three legs.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves lived in little log houses and sleep on wood beds. The beds\r\nwas make three-legged. They make augur hole in side of the house and put\r\nin pieces of wood to make the bed frame, and they put straw and cotton\r\nmattress on them bed.\r\n\r\n\"Old marster used to let he slaves have a extry cotton patch to\r\ntheyselves and they work it by the moonlight. They could sell that\r\ncotton and have the money for theyselves.\r\n\r\n\"My white mistus was a Christian and she'd own her God anywhere. She\r\nused to shout, jus' sit and clap her hands and say, 'Hallalujah.' Once I\r\nseed her shout in church and I thinks something ail her and I run down\r\nthe aisle and goes to fannin' her.\r\n\r\n\"One of the slaves was a sort-a preacher and sometimes marster 'lowed\r\nhim to preach to the niggers, but he have to preach with a tub over his\r\nhead, 'cause he git so happy he talk too loud. Somebody from the big\r\nhouse liable to come down and make him quit 'cause he makin' 'sturbance.\r\n\r\n\"I brings water from the well and they have what they call piggins, and\r\nthey was little tubs with two handles. Mistus wouldn' 'low me to do any\r\nheavy work.\r\n\r\n\"I see sojers and knits socks for 'em by moonshine. Me and my husban'\r\nwas married by a Yankee sojer. I was dress in white Tarleyton weddin'\r\ndress and I didn' wear no hoop skirt. I had a pretty wreath of little\r\nwhite flowers, little bitty, little dainty ones, the pretties' little\r\nthings. When I marry, my sister marry too and our husban's was brudders.\r\nMy husban' dress in suit of white linen. He sho' look handsome. He give\r\nme a gol' ring and a cup and saucer for weddin' gif'. We git married in\r\nHuntsville and us didn' go no weddin' journey trip. We was so poor we\r\ncouldn' go round the house! I's 'bout twenty some year when I marries,\r\nbut I don' know jus' how old. We has a big dance that night and the\r\nwhite folks come, 'cause they likes to see the niggers dance.\r\n\r\n\"The white folks had interes' in they cullud people where I live.\r\nSometimes they's as many as fifty cradle with little nigger babies in\r\n'em and the mistus, she look after them and take care of them, too. She\r\nturn them and dry them herself. She had a little gal git water and help.\r\nShe never had no chillen of her own. I'd blow the horn for the mudders\r\nof the little babies to come in from the fields and nurse 'em, in\r\nmornin' and afternoon. Mistus feed them what was old enough to eat\r\nvictuals. Sometimes, they mammies take them to the field and fix pallet\r\non ground for them to lay on.\r\n\r\n\"The las' word my old Mistus Pankey say when she die was, 'You take care\r\nof Charlette.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420249\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Francis Black]\r\n\r\n\r\n     FRANCIS BLACK was born at Grand Bluff, Mississippi, about 1850, on\r\n     the Jim Carlton plantation. When five years old, she was stolen and\r\n     taken to the slave market in New Orleans. Failing to sell her\r\n     there, the slave traders took her to Jefferson, Texas, and sold her\r\n     to Bill Tumlin. Francis stayed with him five years after she was\r\n     freed, then married and moved to Cass County, Texas. She became\r\n     blind a year ago, and now lives at the Bagland Old Folks Home, 313\r\n     Elm St., Texarkana, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My name am Francis Black, and I don't know jes' how old I is, but\r\n'members lots 'bout them slave days. I was a big gal, washin' and\r\nironin', when they sot the darkies free. From that, I cal'late I'm in my\r\neighties.\r\n\r\n\"I was born in Grand Bluff, in Mississippi, on Old Man Carlton's\r\nplantation, and I was stole from my folks when I was a li'l gal and\r\nnever seed them no more. Us kids played in the big road there in\r\nMississippi, and one day me and 'nother gal is playin' up and down the\r\nroad and three white men come 'long in a wagon. They grabs us up and\r\nputs us in the wagon and covers us with quilts. I hollers and yells and\r\none the men say, 'Shet up, you nigger, or I'll kill you.' I told him,\r\n'Kill me if you wants to--you stole me from my folks.'\r\n\r\n\"Them men took us to New Orleans to the big slave market. I had long\r\nhair and they cut it off like a boy and tried to sell me, but I told\r\nthem men what looks at me, the men cut my hair off and stole me. The man\r\nwhat cut my hair off cursed me and said if I didn't hush he'd kill me,\r\nbut he couldn't sell us at New Orleans and took us to Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\"I never knowed what they done with the other gal, but they sold me to\r\nMarse Bill Tumlin, what run a big livery stable in Jefferson, and I\r\n'longed to him till surrender. I lived in the house with them, 'cause\r\nthey had a boy and gal and I did for them. They bought me clothes and\r\ntook good care of me but I never seed no money till surrender. I et what\r\nthey et, after they got through. Missy say she didn't 'lieve in feedin'\r\nthe darkies scraps, like some folks.\r\n\r\n\"I played with them two chillen all day, then sot the table. I was so\r\nsmall I'd git in a chair to reach the dishes out of the safe. I had to\r\npull a long flybrush over the table whilst the white folks et.\r\n\r\n\"Marse Tumlin had a farm 'bout four mile from town, and a overseer, and\r\nI seed him buckle the niggers crost a log and whip them. Marse lived in\r\nJefferson, heself, and when he'd go to the farm he allus took his boy\r\nwith him. We'd be playin' in the barn and Marse call from the house,\r\n'Come on, Jimmie, we're gwine to the farm.' Jimmie allus say to me,\r\n'Come on, nigger, let's ride round the farm.' I'd say, 'I ain't no\r\nnigger.' He'd say, 'Yes, you is, my pa paid $200 for you. He bought you\r\nfor to play with me.'\r\n\r\n\"Jefferson was a good town till it burned up. I 'members the big fire\r\nwhat looked like the whole town gwineter burn up. Marse Bill lost his\r\nlivery stable in the fire.\r\n\r\n\"The Yankee soldiers, all dressed in blue, come to run the town after\r\nthe war. Marse Tumlin done told me I'm free, but I stays on till I'm\r\nmost growed. Then I works round town and marries Dave Black, and we\r\nmoved to Cass County. I raises six chillun but my old man done git so\r\ntriflin' and mean I quit him and worked for myself. I come to Texarkana\r\nto work, and allus could earn my own livin' till 'bout a year ago I lost\r\nmy seein', and Albert Ragland done took me in his home for the old\r\nfolks. They gives me a $10 a month pension now. They is good to me here\r\nand feeds us good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420142\r\n\r\n\r\n     OLIVIER BLANCHARD, 95 years old, was a slave of Clairville La San,\r\n     who owned a large plantation in Martinville Parish, Louisiana. His\r\n     father was a Frenchman and Olivier speaks rather haltingly, as\r\n     though it is difficult for him to express his thoughts in English,\r\n     for he has talked a species of French all his life. He lives in\r\n     Beaumont, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was plowing and hoeing before the freedom and I talk more of the\r\nFrench 'cause I comes from St. Martinville Parish. I was born there in\r\nLouisiana and my mama was Angeline Jean Pierre and she was slave born.\r\nMy papa was Olivier Blanchard and he white man carpenter on old\r\nplantation. We belong to Clairville La San and all live on\r\nthat place. My papa just plain carpenter but could draw patterns for\r\nhouses. I don't know where he larn that work.\r\n\r\n\"I was count freeborn and still have one white half sister alive. When\r\nfreedom come my mama and papa split up and mama get marry.\r\n\r\n\"I pick cotton and mama cook. She make koosh-koosh and cyayah--that last\r\nplain clabber. Mama cook lots of gaspergou and carp and the poisson ami\r\nfish, with the long snout--what they call gar now. I think it eel fish\r\nthey strip the skin off and wrap round the hair and make it curly.\r\n\r\n\"The Bayou Teche, it run close by and the women do all the clothes with\r\na big paddle with holes in it to clean them in the bayou. They paddle\r\nthem clean on the rocks and then wash them in the water.\r\n\r\n\"One time one big bayou 'gator come up and bite a woman's arm off. She\r\nmy sister in law. But they keep on washing the clothes in the bayou just\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\n\"We have plenty to eat and peaches and muscadines and pecans, 'cause\r\nthere right smart woods and swamp there. We play in the woods and most\r\ntime in the bayou on boats with planks what would float. We had the good\r\ntime and had a little pet coon. You know, the coon like sweet things and\r\nhe steal our syrup and when we chase him with the switch he hide under\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\n\"My old missus was good Catholic and she have us christened and make the\r\nfirst communion. That not registered, 'cause it before the freedom, but\r\nit were in old St. Martin's church, same old church what stand now.\r\nThere was a statue of Pere Jean, the old priest, in front the church and\r\none of St. Martin, too.\r\n\r\n\"Plenty men from St. Martinville go to the war and Archie DeBlieu, he go\r\nto Virginia and fight. The first one to pass our place was John Well\r\nBanks and he was a Yankee going up the Red River.\r\n\r\n\"The yellow fever came durin' that war and kill lots. All the big\r\nplantation have the graveyard for the cullud people. That fever so bad\r\nthey get the coffin ready before they dead and they so scared that some\r\nweren't dead but they think they are and bury them. There was a white\r\ngirl call Colene Sonnier what was to marry Sunday and she take sick\r\nFriday before. She say not to bury her in the ground but they put her\r\nthere while they got the tomb ready. When they open the ground grave to\r\nput her in the tomb they find she buried alive and she eat all her own\r\nshoulder and hand away. Her sweetheart, Gart Berrild, he see that\r\ncorpse, and he go home and get took with yellow fever and die.\r\n\r\n\"They was the old lady what die. She was a terrible soul. One time after\r\nshe die I go to get water out of her rain barrel and I had a lamp in one\r\nhand. That old lady's ghost blowed out the lamp and slapped the pitcher\r\nout my hand. After she first die her husband put black dress on her and\r\ntie up the jaw with a rag and my girl look in the room and there that\r\nold lady, Liza Lee, sittin' by the fire. My girl tell her mama and after\r\nthree day she go back, and Liza Lee buried but my wife see her sittin'\r\nby the fire. Then she sorry she whip the chile for sayin' she saw Liza\r\nLee. That old lady, Liza Lee, was a tart and she stay a tart for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"I marry 72 year ago in the Catholic Church in St. Martinville. My wife\r\ncall Adeline Chretien and she dead 37 year. We have seven children but\r\nfour live now. Frank my only boy live now, in Iowa, in Louisiana, and my\r\ntwo girls live, Enziede De Querive and Rose Baptiste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420199\r\n\r\n\r\n     JULIA BLANKS was born of a slave mother and a three-quarter Indian\r\n     father, in San Antonio, in the second year of the Civil War. Her\r\n     mother, part French and part Negro, was owned by Mrs. John G.\r\n     Wilcox, formerly a Miss Donaldson, who had lived at the White\r\n     House, and who gave Julia to her daughter. After the slaves were\r\n     freed, Julia continued to live with her mother in San Antonio\r\n     until, at fifteen, she married Henry Hall. Five years later her\r\n     second marriage took place, at Leon Springs, Texas, where she lived\r\n     until moving to the Adams ranch, on the Frio River. Here she raised\r\n     her family. After leaving the Adams ranch, Julia and Henry bought\r\n     two sections of state land, but after four years they let it go\r\n     back because of Henry's ill health, and moved to Uvalde.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was born in San Antonio, in 1862. My mother's name was Rachael\r\nMiller. I don't know if she was born in Tennessee or Mississippi. I\r\nheard her talk of both places. I don't know nothing about my father,\r\nbecause he run off when I was about three months old. He was\r\nthree-quarter Cherokee Indian. They were lots of Indians then, and my\r\nhusband's people come from Savannah, Georgia, and he said they was lots\r\nof Indians there. I had two sisters and one brother and the sisters are\r\ndead but my brother lives somewhere in Arizona. My mother's master's\r\nname was John C. Wilcox.\r\n\r\n\"When we was small chillen, they hired my sisters out, but not me. My\r\ngrandfather bought my grandmother's time and they run a laundry house.\r\nThey hired my mother out, too.\r\n\r\n\"You see, my grandmother was free born, but they stole her and sold her\r\nto Miss Donaldson. She was half French. She looked jes' like a French\r\nwoman. She wasn't a slave, but she and her brother were stolen and sold.\r\nShe said the stage coach used to pass her aunt's house, and one day she\r\nand her brother went down to town to buy some buns, and when they were\r\ncomin' back, the stage stopped and asked 'em to ride. She wanted to\r\nride, but her brother didn't. But they kep' coaxin' 'em till they got\r\n'em in. They set her down between the two women that was in there and\r\nset her brother between two men, and when they got close to the house,\r\nthey threw cloaks over their heads and told the driver to drive as fast\r\nas he could, and he sure drove. They taken 'em to Washin'ton, to the\r\nWhite House, and made her a present to Mary Wilcox (Miss Donaldson) and\r\nher brother to somebody else. Then this woman married John C. Wilcox and\r\nthey come to Texas.\r\n\r\n\"She saw a cousin of hers when they got to Washin'ton, and she knew,\r\nafter that, he had somethin' to do with her and her brother bein'\r\nstolen. One day she found a piece of yellow money and took it to her\r\ncousin and he told her it wasn't no good and gave her a dime to go get\r\nher some candy. After that, she saw gold money and knew what it was.\r\n\r\n\"She said she had a good time, though, when she was growing up. They\r\nwere pretty good to her, but after they came to San Antonio, Mrs. Wilcox\r\nbegan bein' mean. She kep' my mother hired out all the time and gave me\r\nto her daughter and my sister to her son. My mother was kep' hired out\r\nall the time, cooking; and after freedom, she just took to washin' and\r\nironin'. My grandfather bought his time and my grandmother's time out.\r\nThey didn't stay with her.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard my mother talk about coffee. They roasted beans and made\r\ncoffee. She says, out on the plantation, they would take bran and put it\r\nin a tub and have 'em stir it up with water in it and let all the white\r\ngo to the bottom and dip it off and strain it and make starch. I have\r\nmade starch out of flour over and often, myself. I had four or five\r\nlittle girls; and I had to keep 'em like pins. In them days they wore\r\nlittle calico dresses, wide and full and standin' out, and a bonnet to\r\nmatch every dress.\r\n\r\n\"I used to hear my grandmother tell about the good times they used to\r\nhave. They would go from one plantation to another and have quiltin's\r\nand corn huskin's. And they would dance. They didn't have dances then\r\nlike they do now. The white people would give them things to eat. They\r\nwould have to hoof it five or six miles and didn't mind it.\r\n\r\n\"They had what they called _patros_, and if you didn't have a pass they\r\nwould whip you and put you in jail. Old Man Burns was hired at the\r\ncourthouse, and if the marsters had slaves that they didn't want to\r\nwhip, they would send them to the courthouse to be whipped. Some of the\r\nmarsters was good and some wasn't. There was a woman, oh, she was the\r\nmeanest thing! I don't know if she had a husband--I never did hear\r\nanything about him. When she would get mad at one of her slave women,\r\nshe would make the men tie her down, and she had what they called\r\ncat-o'-nine-tails, and after she got the blood to come, she would dip it\r\nin salt and pepper and whip her again. Oh, she was mean! My mother's\r\nmarster was good; he wouldn't whip any of his slaves. But his wife\r\nwasn't good. If she got mad at the women, when he would come home she\r\nwould say: 'John, I want you to whip Liza.' Or Martha. And he would say,\r\n'Them are your slaves. You whip them.' He was good and she was mean.\r\n\r\n\"When my aunt would go to clean house, she (Mrs. Wilcox) would turn all\r\nthe pictures in the house but one, the meanest looking one--you know how\r\nit always looks like a picture is watching you everywhere you go--and\r\nshe would tell her if she touched a thing or left a bit of dirt or if\r\nshe didn't do it good, this picture would tell. And she believed it.\r\n\r\n\"My grandmother told a tale one time. You know in slave time they had an\r\nold woman to cook for the chillen. One day they were going to have\r\ncompany. This woman that was the boss of the place where the chillen was\r\nkept told the old cullud woman to take a piece of bacon and grease the\r\nmouths of all the chillen. Then she told a boy to bring them up to these\r\npeople, and the woman said: 'Oh, you must feed these chillen good, just\r\nlook at their mouths!' And the woman said, 'Oh, that's the way they\r\neat.' They didn't get meat often. That was just to make them believe\r\nthey had lots to eat.\r\n\r\n\"No. They were cut off from education. The way my stepfather got his\r\nlearning was a cullud blacksmith would teach school at night, and us\r\nchillen taught our mother. She didn't know how to spell or read or\r\nnothin'. She didn't know B from bull's foot. Some of them were allowed\r\nto have church and some didn't. Mighty few read the Bible 'cause they\r\ncouldn't read. As my mother used to say, they were raised up as green\r\nas cucumbers. That old blacksmith was the onlyist man that knew how to\r\nread and write in slavery time that I knew of. My grandmother or none of\r\nthem knew how to read; they could count, but that was all. That's what\r\nmakes me mad. I tell my grandchillen they ought to learn all they can\r\n'cause the old people never had a chance. My husband never did have any\r\nschooling, but he sure could figger. Now, if you want me to get tangled\r\nup, just give me a pencil and paper and I don't know nothing.\" She\r\ntapped her skull. \"I figger in my head! The chillen, today, ought to\r\nappreciate an education.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, they were good to the slaves when they were sick. They would\r\nhave the doctor come out and wait on them. Most plantations had what\r\nthey called an old granny cullud woman that treated the chillen with\r\nherbs and such things.\r\n\r\n\"Games? I don't know. We used to play rap jacket. We would get switches\r\nand whip one another. You know, after you was hit several times it\r\ndidn't hurt much. I've played a many time. In slave time the men used to\r\ngo huntin' at night, and hunt 'possums and 'coons. They would have a dog\r\nor two along. They used to go six or seven miles afoot to corn huskin's\r\nand quiltin's. And those off the other plantations would come over and\r\njoin in the work. And they would nearly always have a good dinner.\r\nSometimes some of the owners would give 'em a hog or somethin' nice to\r\neat, but some of 'em didn't.\r\n\r\n\"No'm, I don't know if they run off to the North, but some of them\r\nrunned off and stayed in the swamps, and they was mean. They called them\r\nrunaways. If they saw you, they would tell you to bring them something\r\nto eat. And if you didn't do it, if they ever got you they sure would\r\nfix you.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know when my mother was set free. My husband's marster's name\r\nwas King. He was from Savannah, Georgia, but at the time was living\r\nclose to Boerne. My husband's father was killed in the war. When my\r\nhusband was about ten years old, his marster hadn't told them they was\r\nfree. You know some of them didn't tell the slaves they was free until\r\nthey had to. After freedom was declared, lots of people didn't tell the\r\nslaves they were free. One morning, my husband said, he happended to\r\nlook out and he saw a big bunch of men coming down the road, and he\r\nthought he never saw such pretty men in his life on them horses. They\r\nhad so many brass buttons on their clothes it looked like gold. So he\r\nrun and told his mama, and she looked and saw it was soldiers, and some\r\nof 'em told the boss, and he looked and saw them soldiers comin' in the\r\nbig gate and he called 'em in quick, and told them they were free. So\r\nwhen the soldiers come, they asked him if he had told his slaves they\r\nwere free, and he said yes. They asked the Negroes if they lived there,\r\nand they said yes. One said, 'He just told us we was free.' The soldiers\r\nasked him why he had just told them, and he said they wasn't all there\r\nand he was waiting for them all to be there.\r\n\r\n\"My husband said he thought them was the prettiest bunch of men he ever\r\nsaw, and the prettiest horses. Of course, he hadn't never saw any\r\nsoldiers before. I know it looked pretty to me when I used to see the\r\nsoldiers at the barracks and hear the band playin' and see them drillin'\r\nand ever'thing. You see, we lived on a little cross-street right back of\r\nSt. Mary's Church in San Antonio, I don't know how that place is now.\r\nWhere the post office is now, there used to be a blacksmith shop and my\r\nfather worked there. I went back to San Antonio about fifteen years ago\r\nand jes' took it afoot and looked at the changes.\r\n\r\n\"I was fifteen years old the first time I married. It was almost a\r\nrun-a-way marriage. I was married in San Antonio. My first husband's\r\nname was Henry Hall. My first wedding dress was as wide as a wagon\r\nsheet. It was white lawn, full of tucks, and had a big ruffle at the\r\nbottom. I had a wreath and a veil, too. The veil had lace all around it.\r\nWe danced and had a supper. We danced all the dances they danced then;\r\nthe waltz, square, quadrille, polka, and the gallopade--and that's what\r\nit was, all right; you shore galloped. You'd start from one end of the\r\nhall and run clear to the other end. In those days, the women with all\r\nthem long trains--the man would hold it over his arm. No, Lord!\r\nHoneymoons wasn't thought of then. No'm, I never worked out a day in my\r\nlife.\" Jokingly, \"I guess they thought I was too good looking. I was\r\nabout twenty years old when I married the second time. I was married in\r\nLeon Springs the second time.\r\n\r\n\"Before we come out to this country from Leon Springs, they was wild\r\ngrapes, dewberries, plums and agaritas, black haws, red haws. M-m-m!\r\nThem dewberries, I dearly love 'em! I never did see wild cherries out\r\nhere. I didn't like the cherries much, but they make fine wine. We used\r\nto gather mustang grapes and make a barrel of wine.\r\n\r\n\"After I married the second time, we lived on the Adams ranch on the\r\nFrio and stayed on that ranch fifteen years. We raised all our chillen\r\nright on that ranch. I am taken for a Mexkin very often. I jes' talk\r\nMexkin back to 'em. I learned to talk it on the ranch. As long as I have\r\nlived at this place, I have never had a cross word about the chillen.\r\nAll my neighbors here is Mexkins. They used to laugh at me when I tried\r\nto talk to the hands on the ranch, but I learned to talk like 'em.\r\n\r\n\"We used to have big round-ups out on the Adams ranch. They had fences\r\nthen. The neighbors would all come over and get out and gather the\r\ncattle and bring 'em in. Up at Leon Springs at that time they didn't\r\nhave any fences, and they would have big round-ups there. But after we\r\ncome out here, it was different. He would notify his neighbors they were\r\ngoin' to gather cattle on a certain day. The chuck wagon was right there\r\nat the ranch, that is, _I_ was the chuck wagon. But if they were goin' to\r\ntake the cattle off, they would have a chuck wagon. They would round up\r\na pasture at a time and come in to the ranch for their meals. Now on the\r\nWallace ranch, they would always take a chuck wagon. When they were\r\ngettin' ready to start brandin' at the ranch, my husband always kep' his\r\nbrandin' irons all in the house, hangin' up right where he could get his\r\nhands on 'em. Whenever they would go off to other ranches to gather\r\ncattle, you would see ever' man with his beddin' tied up behind him on\r\nhis horse. He'd have jes' a small roll. They would always have a slicker\r\nif nothin' else. That slicker answered for ever'thing sometimes. My\r\nhusband slep' many a night with his saddle under his head.\r\n\r\n\"He used to carry mail from San Antonio to Dog Town, horseback. That was\r\nthe town they used to call Lodi (Lodo), but I don't know how to spell\r\nit, and don't know what it means. It was a pretty tough town. The jail\r\nhouse was made out of 'dobe and pickets. They had a big picket fence all\r\naround it. They had a ferry that went right across the San Antonio River\r\nfrom Floresville to Dog Town. I know he told me he come to a place and\r\nthey had a big sign that said, 'Nigga, don't let the sun go down on you\r\nhere.' They was awful bad down in there. He would leave Dog Town in the\r\nevenin' and he would get to a certain place up toward San Antonio to\r\ncamp, and once he stopped before he got to the place he always camped\r\nat. He said he didn't know what made 'im stop there that time, but he\r\nstopped and took the saddle off his horse and let 'im graze while he lay\r\ndown. After a while, he saw two cigarette fires in the dark right up the\r\nroad a little piece, and he heard a Mexkin say, 'I don't see why he's so\r\nlate tonight. He always gets here before night and camps right there.'\r\nHe knew they was waylayin' 'im, so he picked his saddle up right easy\r\nand carried it fu'ther back down the road in the brush and then come got\r\nhis horse and took him out there and saddled 'im up and went away 'round\r\nthem Mexkins. He went on in to San Antonio and didn't go back any more.\r\nA white man took the mail to carry then and the first trip he made, he\r\nnever come back. He went down with the mail and they found the mail\r\nscattered somewhere on the road, but they never found the man, or the\r\nhorse, either.\r\n\r\n\"On the Adams ranch, in the early days, we used to have to pack water up\r\nthe bank. You might not believe it, but one of these sixty-pound lard\r\ncans full of water, I've a-carried it on my head many a time. We had\r\nsteps cut into the bank, and it was a good ways down to the water, and\r\nI'd pack that can up to the first level and go back and get a couple a\r\nbuckets of water, and carry a bucket in each hand and the can on my head\r\nup the next little slantin' hill before I got to level ground. I carried\r\nwater that way till my chillen got big enough to carry water, then they\r\ntook it up. When I was carryin' water in them big cans my head would\r\nsound like new leather--you know how it squeaks, and that was the way it\r\nsounded in my head. But, it never did hurt me. You see, the Mexkins\r\ncarry loads on their heads, but they fix a rag around their heads some\r\nway to help balance it. But I never did. I jes' set it up on my head and\r\ncarried it that way. Oh, we used to carry water! My goodness! My mother\r\nsaid it was the Indian in me--the way I could carry water.\r\n\r\n\"When we were first married and moved to the Adams ranch, we used to\r\ncome here to Uvalde to dances. They had square dances then. They hadn't\r\ncommenced all these frolicky dances they have now. They would have a\r\nsupper, but they had it to sell. Every fellow would have to treat his\r\ngirl he danced with.\r\n\r\n\"I can remember when my grandfather lived in a house with a dirt floor,\r\nand they had a fireplace. And I can remember just as well how he used to\r\nbake hoecakes for us kids. He would rake back the coals and ashes real\r\nsmooth and put a wet paper down on that and then lay his hoecake down on\r\nthe paper and put another paper on top of that and the ashes on top. I\r\nused to think that was the best bread I ever ate. I tried it a few\r\ntimes, but I made such a mess I didn't try it any more. One thing I have\r\nseen 'em make, especially on the ranch. You take and clean a stick and\r\nyou put on a piece of meat and piece of fat till you take and use up the\r\nheart and liver and sweetbread and other meat and put it on the stick\r\nand wrap it around with leaf fat and then put the milk gut, or marrow\r\ngut, around the whole thing. They call that _macho_ (mule), and I tell\r\nyou, it's good. They make it out of a goat and sheep, mostly.\r\n\r\n\"Another thing, we used to have big round-ups, and I have cooked great\r\npans of steak and mountain orshters. Generally, at the brandin' and\r\nmarkin', I cooked up many a big pan of mountain orshters. I wish I had a\r\nnickel for ever' one I've cooked, and ate too! People from up North have\r\ncome down there, and, when they were brandin' and cuttin' calves there,\r\nthey sure did eat and enjoy that dinner.\r\n\r\n\"The men used to go up to the lake, fishin', and catch big trout, or\r\nbass, they call 'em now; and we'd take big buckets of butter--we didn't\r\ntake a saucer of butter or a pound; we taken butter up there in buckets,\r\nfor we sure had plenty of it--and we'd take lard too, and cook our fish\r\nup there, and had corn bread or hoe cakes and plenty of butter for\r\never'thing, and it sure was good. I tell you--like my husband used to\r\nsay--we was livin' ten days in the week, then.\r\n\r\n\"When we killed hogs, the meat from last winter was hung outside and\r\nthen new meat, salted down and then smoked, put in there, and we would\r\ncook the old bacon for the dogs. We always kep' some good dogs there,\r\nand anybody'll tell you they was always fat. We had lots of wild turkeys\r\nand I raised turkeys, too, till I got sick of cookin' turkeys. Don't\r\ntalk about deer! You know, it wasn't then like it is now. You could go\r\nkill venison any time you wanted to. But I don't blame 'em for passin'\r\nthat law, for people used to go kill 'em and jes' take out the hams and\r\ntenderloin and leave the other layin' there. I have saved many a sack of\r\ndried meat to keep it from spoilin'.\r\n\r\n\"We would raise watermelons, too. We had a big field three mile from the\r\nhouse and a ninety-acre field right in the house. We used to go get\r\nloads of melons for the hogs and they got to where they didn't eat\r\nanything but the heart.\r\n\r\n\"I used to leave my babies at the house with the older girl and go out\r\nhorseback with my husband. My oldest girl used to take the place of a\r\ncowboy, and put her hair up in her hat. And ride! My goodness, she loved\r\nto ride! They thought she was a boy. She wore pants and leggin's. And\r\nmaybe you think she couldn't ride!\r\n\r\n\"After we left that ranch, we took up some state land. I couldn't tell\r\nyou how big that place was. We had 640 in one place and 640 in another\r\nplace; it was a good big place. After my husband got sick, we had to let\r\nit go back. We couldn't pay it out. We only lived on it about four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\"My husband has been dead about nineteen years. I had a pen full and a\r\nhalf of chillen. I have four livin' chillen, two girls and two boys. I\r\nhave a girl, Carrie, in California, workin' in the fruit all the time;\r\none boy, George, in Arizona, workin' in the mines; and a girl in\r\nArizona, Lavinia, washes and irons and cooks and ever'thing else she can\r\nget at. And I have one boy here. I have ten grandchillen and I've got\r\nfive great grandchillen.\r\n\r\n\"I belong to the Methodist Church. I joined about twenty-five years ago.\r\nMy husband joined with me. But here, of late years, when I go to church,\r\nit makes me mad to see how the people do the preacher up there trying to\r\ndo all the good he can do and them settin' back there laughin' and\r\ntalkin'. I was baptized. There was about five or six of us baptized in\r\nthe Leona down here.\r\n\r\n\"People tell that I've got plenty and don't need help. Even the Mexkins\r\nhere and ever'body say I've got money. Jes' because we had that farm\r\ndown there they think I come out with money. But what in the world would\r\nI want with money if I didn't use it? I can't take it with me when I die\r\nand I could be gettin' the use of it now while I need it. I could have\r\nwhat I want to eat, anyway. I'm gettin' a little pension, but it ain't\r\nnear enough to keep us. I've got these two grandchillen here, and things\r\nis so high, too, so I don't have enough of anything without skimpin' all\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420312\r\n\r\n\r\n     ELVIRA BOLES, 94, has outlived nine of her ten children. She lives\r\n     at 3109 Manzana St., El Paso, Texas, with her daughter, Minnie. She\r\n     was born a slave of the Levi Ray family near Lexington,\r\n     Mississippi, and was sold as a child to Elihn Boles, a neighboring\r\n     plantation owner. During the last year of the Civil War she was\r\n     brought to Texas, with other refugee slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I jus' 'member my first marster and missus, 'cause she don' want me\r\nthere. I'se a child of the marster. Dey didn' tell me how old I was when\r\ndey sold me to Boles. My missus sold me to Boles. Dey tuk us to where\r\ndere was a heap of white folks down by the court house and we'd be there\r\nin lots and den de whites 'ud bid for us. I don' know how old I was, but\r\nI washed dishes and den dey put me to work in de fields. We don' git a\r\nnickel in slavery.\r\n\r\n\"Marster Boles didn' have many slaves on de farm, but lots in brickyard.\r\nI toted brick back and put 'em down where dey had to be. Six bricks each\r\nload all day. That's de reason I ain't no 'count, I'se worked to death.\r\nI fired de furnace for three years. Stan'in' front wid hot fire on my\r\nface. Hard work, but God was wid me. We'd work 'till dark, quit awhile\r\nafter sundown. Marster was good to slaves, didn' believe in jus' lashin'\r\n'em. He'd not be brutal but he'd kill 'em dead right on the spot.\r\nOverseers 'ud git after 'em and whop 'em down.\r\n\r\n\"I'se seventeen, maybe, when I married to slave of Boles. Married on\r\nSaturday night. Dey give me a dress and dey had things to eat, let me\r\nhave something like what you call a party. We just had common clothes\r\non. And then I had to work every day. I'd leave my baby cryin' in de\r\nyard and he'd be cryin', but I couldn' stay. Done everything but split\r\nrails. I've cut timber and ploughed. Done everything a man could do. I\r\ncouldn' notice de time, but I'd be glad to git back to my baby.\r\n\r\n\"Log cabins had dirt floor, sometimes plankin' down. I worked late and\r\nmade pretty quilts. Sometimes dey'd let us have a party. Saturday\r\nnights, de white people give us meat and stuff. Give us syrup and we'd\r\nmake candy, out in de yard. We'd ask our frien's and dance all night.\r\nDen go to work next day. We'd clean off de yard and dance out dere.\r\nChristmas come, dey give us a big eggnog and give us cake. Our white\r\nfolks did. White folks chillen had bought candy. We didn' git any, but\r\ndey let us play wid de white chillen. We'd play smut. Whoever beat wid\r\nde cards, he'd git to smut you. Take de smut from fireplace and rub on\r\nyour face.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor take care of us iffen we sick, so's git us well to git us to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\"Iffen dey had a pretty girl dey would take 'em, and I'se one of 'em,\r\nand my oldest child, he boy by Boles, almost white.\r\n\r\n\"We had to steal away at night to have church on de ditch bank, and\r\ncrawl home on de belly. Once overseers heered us prayin', give us one\r\nday each 100 lashes.\r\n\r\n\"Den when de Yankees come through, dey 'ud be good to de slaves, to keep\r\n'em from tellin' on 'em. Freedom was give Jan. 1, 1865, but de slaves\r\ndidn' know it 'till June 19. We'se refugees. Boles, our marster, sent us\r\nout and we come from Holmes County to Cherokee County in a wagon. We was\r\na dodgin' in and out, runnin' from de Yankees. Marster said dey was\r\nrunnin' us from de Yankees to keep us, but we was free and didn' know\r\nit. I lost my baby, its buried somewhere on dat road. Died at Red River\r\nand we left it. De white folks go out and buy food 'long de road and\r\nhide us. Dey say we'd never be free iffen dey could git to Texas wid us,\r\nbut de people in Texas tol' us we's free. Den marster turn us loose in\r\nde world, without a penny. Oh, dey was awful times. We jus' worked from\r\nplace to place after freedom.\r\n\r\n\"When we started from Mississippi, dey tol' us de Yankees 'ud kill us\r\niffen dey foun' us, and dey say, 'You ain't got no time to take nothin'\r\nto whar you goin'. Take your little bundle and leave all you has in your\r\nhouse.' So when we got to Texas I jus' had one dress, what I had on.\r\nDat's de way all de cullud people was after freedom, never had nothin'\r\nbut what had on de back. Some of dem had right smart in dere cabins, but\r\nthey was skeered and dey lef' everything. Bed clothes and all you had\r\nwas lef'. We didn' know any better den.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420102\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Betty Bormer (Bonner)]\r\n\r\n\r\n     BETTY BORMER, 80, was born a slave to Col. M.T. Johnson, who farmed\r\n     at Johnson Station in Tarrant County. He owned Betty's parents,\r\n     five sisters and four brothers, in addition to about 75 other\r\n     slaves. After the family was freed, they moved with the other\r\n     slaves to a piece of land Col. Johnson allowed them the use of\r\n     until his death. Betty lives in a negro settlement at Stop Six, a\r\n     suburb of Fort Worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'se bo'n April 4th, in 1857, at Johnson Station. It was named after my\r\nmarster. He had a big farm, I'se don' know how many acres. He had seven\r\nchillen; three boys, Ben, Tom and Mart, and four girls, Elizabeth,\r\nSally, Roddy and Veanna.\r\n\r\n\"Marster Johnson was good to us cullud folks and he feeds us good. He\r\nkep' lots of hawgs, dat makes de meat. In de smokehouse am hung up meat\r\nenough for to feed de army, it looks like. We'uns have all de clothes we\r\nneed and dey was made on de place. My mammy am de sewing woman and my\r\npappy am de shoemaker. My work, for to nuss de small chillen of de\r\nmarster.\r\n\r\n\"On Sat'day we's let off work and lots de time some of us come to Fort\r\nWorth wid de marster and he gives us a nickel or a dime for to buy\r\ncandy.\r\n\r\n\"Dey whips de niggers sometimes, but 'twarn't hard. You know, de nigger\r\ngits de devilment in de head, like folks do, sometimes, and de marster\r\nhave to larn 'em better. He done dat hisself and he have no overseer. No\r\nnigger tried run away, 'cause each family have a cabin wid bunks for to\r\nsleep on and we'uns all live in de quarters. Sich nigger as wants to\r\nlarn read and write, de marster's girls and boys larns 'em. De girls\r\nlarned my auntie how to play de piano.\r\n\r\n\"Dere am lots of music on dat place; fiddle, banjo and de piano.\r\nSingin', we had lots of dat, songs like Ole Black Joe and 'ligious songs\r\nand sich. Often de marster have we'uns come in his house and clears de\r\ndinin' room for de dance. Dat am big time, on special occasion. Dey not\r\ncalls it 'dance' dem days, dey calls it de 'ball.'\r\n\r\n\"Sho', we'uns goes to church and de preacher's name, it was Jack Ditto.\r\n\r\n\"Durin' de war, I notices de vittles am 'bout de same. De soldiers come\r\ndere and dey driv' off over de hill some of de cattle for to kill for to\r\neat. Once dey took some hosses and I hears marster say dem was de\r\nQuantrell mens. Dey comes several times and de marster don' like it, but\r\nhe cain't help it.\r\n\r\n\"When freedom come marster tells all us to come to front of de house. He\r\nam standin' on de porch. Him 'splains 'bout freedom and says, 'You is\r\nnow free and can go whar you pleases.' Den he tells us he have larned us\r\nnot to steal and to be good and we'uns should 'member dat and if we'uns\r\ngets in trouble to come to him and he will help us. He sho' do dat, too,\r\n'cause de niggers goes to him lots of times and he always helps.\r\n\r\n\"Marster says dat he needs help on de place and sich dat stays, he'd pay\r\n'em for de work. Lots of dem stayed, but some left. To dem dat leaves,\r\nmarster gives a mule, or cow and sich for de start. To my folks, marster\r\ngives some land. He doesn't give us de deed, but de right to stay till\r\nhe dies.\r\n\r\n\"Sho', I seen de Klux after de war but I has no 'sperience wid 'em. My\r\nuncle, he gits whipped by 'em, what for I don' know 'zactly, but I think\r\nit was 'bout a hoss. Marster sho' rave 'bout dat, 'cause my uncle\r\nweren't to blame.\r\n\r\n\"When de Klux come de no 'count nigger sho make de scatterment. Some\r\nclimb up de chimney or jump out de winder and hide in de dugout and\r\nsich.\r\n\r\n\"De marster dies 'bout seven years after freedom and everybody sorry\r\nden.

Now I'se gittin' 'leven dollars from de state for pension,\r\nand gits it every month so now I'se sho' of somethin' to eat and dat\r\nmakes me happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420289\r\n\r\n\r\n     HARRISON BOYD, 87, was born in Rusk County, Texas, a slave of Wash\r\n     Trammel. Boyd remained with his master for four years after\r\n     emancipation, then moved to Harrison County, where he now lives.\r\n     His memory is poor, but he managed to recall a few incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was fifteen years when they says we're free. That's the age my Old\r\nMissy done give me when the war stopped. She had all us niggers' ages in\r\na book, and told me I was born near Henderson. My Old Marse was Wash\r\nTrammel and he brunged me and my mama and papa from Alabama. Mama was\r\nnamed Juliet and papa, Amos. Marse Trammel owned my grandpa and grandma,\r\ntoo, and they was named Jeanette and Josh.\r\n\r\n\"The plantation was two made into one, and plenty big, and more'n a\r\nhundred slaves to work it. Marse lived in a hewed log house,\r\nweather-boarded out and in, and the quarters was good, log houses with\r\nbed railin's hewed out of logs. We raised everything we et, 'cept sugar,\r\nand Marse bought that in big hogsheads. We got our week's rations every\r\nSunday, and when we went to eat, everybody's part was put out to them on\r\na tin plate.\r\n\r\n\"Marse Trammel give a big cornshucking every fall. He had two bottom\r\nfields in corn. First we'd gather peas and cushaws and pumpkins out the\r\ncorn field, then get the corn and pile it front the cribs. They was two\r\nbig cribs for the corn we kep' to use and five big cribs for sale corn.\r\nMy uncle stayed round the sale corn cribs all spring, till ginnin' time,\r\n'cause folks come for miles after corn. Marse had five wheat cribs and\r\none rye crib. We went ten mile to Tatum to git our meal and flour\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"The patterrollers darsn't come 'bout our place or bother us niggers.\r\nMarse Wash allus say, 'I'll patterroller my own place.' Marse was good\r\nto us and only once a overseer beat a woman up a trifle, and Marse\r\nTrammel fired him that same day.\r\n\r\n\"The sojers 'fiscated lots of corn from Marse and some more owners in\r\nRusk County piled corn up in a big heap and made me go mind it till the\r\nrest the sojers got there. I was settin' top that corn pile, me and my\r\nbig bulldog, and the General rode up. My dog growled and I made him\r\nhush. The General man say to me, 'Boy, you is 'scused now, go on home.'\r\nI got to a fence and looked back, and that General was hewin' him a hoss\r\ntrough out a log. The sojers come in droves and set up they camp. I sot\r\non a stump and watched them pass. They stayed three, four days till the\r\ncorn was all fed up.\r\n\r\n\"While they's camped there they'd cotch chickens. They had a fishin'\r\npole and line and hook. They'd put a grain of corn on the hook and ride\r\non they hoss and pitch the hook out 'mong the chickens. When a chicken\r\nswallowed the corn they'd jerk up the line with that chicken and ride\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\"Marse had six hundred bales cotton in the Shreveport warehouse when war\r\nwas over. He got word them Yankees done take it on a boat. He got his\r\nbrother to take him to Shreveport and say, 'I'll follow that cotton to\r\nHell and back.' He followed his cotton to Alabama and got it back, but\r\nhe died and was buried there in Alabama 'fore Old Missy knowed it.\r\n\r\n\"I stayed with her four years after surrender and then went to farmin'\r\nwith my folks, for $10.00 a month. After a year or two I went to\r\nrailroadin', helping cut the right-of-way for the T.& P. Railroad, from\r\nMarshall to Longview. They paid us $1.50 the day and three drinks of\r\nwhiskey a day.\r\n\r\n\"I marries four times but had only one child, but I never done nothin'\r\n'citin'. I lives by myself now, and gits $11.00 pension to eat on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420074\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Issabella Boyd]\r\n\r\n\r\n     ISSABELLA BOYD was born a slave of Gus Wood, in Richmond, Va., who\r\n     moved to Texas by boat before the Civil War.

I's born in dat country and\r\ndey brought me over to Richmond and my papa and mama, too. I was jus'\r\n'bout big 'nough to begin to 'member.\r\n\r\n\"I come from Richmond yere on de boat, sometime de steamboat, sometime\r\nde big boat. When we left New Orleans dat evenin' we struck a big storm.\r\nUs git on dat boat in Richmond and went floatin' down to de big boat dat\r\nmornin'. Looks like it jus' fun for us, but every time we look back and\r\nthink 'bout home it make us sad.\r\n\r\n\"I had a dear, good mistus and my boss man, he furnish a house for he\r\nservants, a purty good house. And dey had a place for de Sunday School.\r\nDem was good times. De mistus cook dinner and send it down for de old\r\nfolks and chillen to have plenty.\r\n\r\n\"My mistus kep' me right in de house, right by her, sewing. I could sew\r\nso fast I git my task over 'fore de others git started good.\r\n\r\n\"Lots of times when de gals wants to go to de dance I he'p make de\r\ndresses. I 'member de pretties' one like yesterday. It have tucks from\r\nde waist to de hem and had diamonds cut all in de skirt.\r\n\r\n\"Our boss man was 'ticular 'bout us being tended to and we was well took\r\ncare of. He brung us to Beaumont when it was de plumb mud hole, and he\r\nsettle down and try to build up and make it a go.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Wood he allus takes de paper and one night they set up da long\r\ntime and do dey readin'. Next mornin' de old cook woman, she say, 'Well,\r\ndey have de big war, and lots of dem wounded.' Befo' long us has to take\r\ncare of some dem wounded soldiers, and dey has de camp place near us.\r\nDey all camp 'round dere and I don't know which was de Yankees and de\r\n'federates.\r\n\r\n\"When we all gits free, dey's de long time lettin' us know. Dey wants to\r\ngit through with de corn and de cotton befo' dey let's de hands loose.\r\nDey was people from other plantations say. 'Niggers, you's free and yere\r\nyou workin'.' Us say, 'No, de gov'ment tell us when we's free.' We\r\nworkin' one day when somebody from Massa Grissom place come by and tell\r\nus we's free, and us stop workin'. Dey tell us to go on workin' and de\r\nboss man he come up and he say he gwine knock us off de fence if we\r\ndon't go to work. Mistus come out and say, 'Ain't you gwine make dem\r\nniggers go to work?' He send her back in de house and he call for de\r\ncarriage and say he goin' to town for to see what de gov'ment goin' do.\r\nNex' day he come back and say, 'Well, you's jus' as free as I is.'\r\n\r\n\"He say to me I could stay and cook for dem, and he give me five dollar\r\na month and a house to stay in and all I kin eat. I stays de month to do\r\ndere work.\r\n\r\n\"After dat I wishes sometimes dat old times is back 'gain. I likes to be\r\nfree, but I wasn't used to it and it was hard to know how to do. I\r\n'members de dances we has in de old times, when we makes de music with\r\nbanjo and other things. Some de good massas 'lowed de niggers dance in\r\nde back yard and if we goes over dere without de pass de patterroles\r\ngits us maybe. One time my papa he runnin' from dem patterroles and he\r\nrun slap into de young massa and he say, 'Oh, you ain't no nigger, I kin\r\ntell by de smell.'\r\n\r\n\"Dat mind me of de ghost story dey used to tell 'bout de ghosties what\r\nlive in de big bridge down in de hollow. De niggers day say dat ghostie\r\nmake too much noise, with all he hollerin' and he rattlin' dem chain. So\r\ndat night one us niggers what dey call Charlie, he say he ain't 'fraid\r\nand he gwineter git him a ghostie, sho' 'nough. Us didn't believe him\r\nbut purty soon us hears right smart wrastlin' with de chains and\r\nhollerin' down by de bridge and after 'while he come and say he git de\r\nbest of dat ghostie, 'cause he ain't got strength like de man.\r\n\r\n\"Me and my old man us have twelve chillens altogedder. My husban' he\r\ncome from South Car'lina whar dey eats cottonseed. I used to joke him\r\n'bout it. I allus say Virginny de best, 'cause I come from dere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420039\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Boyd]\r\n\r\n\r\n     JAMES BOYD was born in Phantom Valley, Indian Territory, in an\r\n     Indian hut. A man named Sanford Wooldrige stole him and brought him\r\n     to Texas, somewhere near Waco. James does not know his age, but\r\n     thinks he is a hundred years or more old. He now lives in Itasca,\r\n     Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I's born in dat Phantom Valley, in de Indian Territory, what am now\r\ncall Oklahoma. Us live in a Indian hut. My pappy Blue Bull Bird and\r\nmammy Nancy Will. She come to de Indian Territory with Santa Anna, from\r\nMississippi, and pappy raise in de Territory. I don' 'member much 'bout\r\nmy folks, 'cause I stole from dem when I a real li'l feller. I's\r\na-fishin' in de Cherokee River and a man name Sanford Wooldrige come by.\r\nYou see, de white folks and de Indians have de fight 'bout dat day. I's\r\non de river and I heared yellin' and shootin' and folkses runnin' and I\r\nslips into some bresh right near. Den come de white man and he say,\r\n'Everybody kilt, nigger, and dem Indians gwine kill you iffen day cotch\r\nyou. Come with me and I ain't 'low dem hurt you.' So I goes with him.\r\n\r\n\"He brung me to Texas, but I don't know jus' where, 'cause I didn't know\r\nnothin' 'bout dat place. Massa Sanford good to us, but look out for he\r\nmissus, she sho' tough on niggers. Dere 'bout 1,600 acres in de\r\nplantation and de big house am nice. When de niggers wouldn't work dey\r\nwhup 'em. Us work all week and sometime Sunday, iffen de crops in a\r\nrush. Massa not much on presents or money but us have warm clothes and\r\nplenty to eat and de dry place to live, and dat more'n lots of niggers\r\nhas now.\r\n\r\n\"Sometime us have de corn huskin' and dere a dollar for de one what\r\nshuck de mos' corn. Us have de big dance 'bout twict a year, on\r\nChristmas and sometime in de summer. When de white folks have dere big\r\nballs us niggers cook and watch dem dance. Us have fun den.\r\n\r\n\"I likes to think of dem times when us fish all de hot day or hunts or\r\njus' lazed 'round when de crops am laid by. I likes to shet de eyes and\r\nbe back in old times and hear 'em sing, \"Swing, low, Sweet Chariot.\" I\r\ncan't sing, now you knows can't no old man sing what ain't got no teef\r\nor hair. I used to like to swing dat 'Ginia Reel and I's spry and young\r\nden.\r\n\r\n\"Dere's lots I can't 'member, 'cause my mem'ry done gone weak like de\r\nres' of me, but I 'member when us free us throw de hats in de air and\r\nholler. Old massa say, 'How you gwine eat and git clothes and sech?' Den\r\nus sho' scairt and stays with us white folks long as us can. But 'bout a\r\nyear after dat I gits de job punchin' cattle on a ranch in South Texas.\r\nI druv cattle into Kansas, over what de white folks calls de Chissum\r\nTrail. I worked lots of cattle and is what dey call a top hand. I's\r\nworkin' for Massa Boyd den, and he gits me to drive some cattle to\r\nMexico. He say he ain't well no more and for me to sell de cattle and\r\nsend him de money and git de job down dere. I goes on down to Mexico and\r\ndo what he say. I marries a gal name Martina in 1869, down in Matamoras.\r\nUs have four chillen and she die. Dat break me up and I drifts back to\r\nHuntsville.\r\n\r\n\"I done change my name from Scott Bird, what it am up in de Territory,\r\nand make it James Boyd, 'cause I done work for Massa Boyd. I's gwine be\r\n'bout 108 year old in next January, iffen de Lawd spare me dat long.\r\n\r\n\"After I been in Huntsville awhile, I marries Emma Smith but us only\r\nstay together 'bout a year and a half. Wasn't no chillen. Den I drifts\r\nto Fort Bend County and dere I marries Mary McDowd and us have two\r\nchillen. She die with de yellow fever and off I goes for Burleson\r\nCounty. Dere I marries Sally McDave and she quits me after us have three\r\nchillen. Down in old Washington County I marries Frances Williams and us\r\nlived together till 1900. Dere am no chillen dere. Den I goes to Austin\r\nafter she die and marries Eliza Bunton in 1903. Us have eight chillen\r\nand she die in 1911. Den I comes to Hill County and marries Mittie Cahee\r\nin 1916. She quit me. In 1924 I marries Hegar Price clost to Milford. Us\r\nlive together now, in Itasca. Us didn't have no chillen, but dat don't\r\nmatter, 'cause I's de daddy of 'bout twenty already.\r\n\r\n\"I mos' allus wore de black suit when I marries. Jes' seemed more\r\ndressed up like. Some my wives wear white and some colors, didn't make\r\nmuch diff'rence, so dey a likely lookin' gal for me. Sometime it am a\r\npreacher and sometime it am Jestice of Peace, but de fust time it am\r\nCatholic and priest and all.\r\n\r\n\"Talkin' 'bout all dis marryin', I mos' forgit to show you my scar. I\r\nfit in dat freedom war 'long side Massa Sanford and got shot. Dat bullet\r\ngo through de breast and out de back and keep me six months in de bed.\r\nDe fust battle I's in am at Halifax, in North Car'lina. Us git de news\r\nof freedom when us at Vicksburg, in Mississippi. Mos' us niggers 'fraid\r\nsay much. De new niggers 'spect de gov'ment give dem de span of mules\r\nand dey be rich and not work. But dey done larn a lot dese past years.\r\nUs am sho' slaves now to hard work, and lucky iffen us git work. Lots\r\ndem niggers figgers dey'd git dere massa's land, but dey didn't. Dey\r\noughta of knowed dey wouldn't. Warn't no plantation ever divided I\r\nknowed of, but some de massas give de oldest slaves a li'l piece land.\r\n\r\n\"After de cattle days done gone, I farms in Hill County. I works twelve\r\nyear for Massa Claude Wakefield, right near Milford, too. De old man\r\nain't due to live nowhere long and I's gittin' 'bout ready to cross de\r\nriver. I's seed a heap of dis here earth and de people in it, but I\r\ntells you it am sho' hard time now. Us is old and cripple' and iffen de\r\nwhite folks don't holp us I don't know what us gwine do.\r\n\r\n\"Some dese young niggers gone plumb wild with dere cigars and cars and\r\ntruckin' and jazzin' and sech. Some go to school and larn like white\r\nfolks and teach and be real helpful. But talk 'bout workin' in slave\r\ntime--'twarn't so hard as now. Den you fuss 'cause dere's work, now you\r\nfuss 'cause dere ain't no work. But den us have somethin' to eat and\r\nwear and a place to sleep, and now us don't know one day what gwine fill\r\nus tomorrow, or nothin'.\r\n\r\n\"I'd sho' like to shake Massa Boyd's hand again and hear him come\r\nsingin' down de lane. Us hear him sing or whistle long 'fore he git dere\r\nand it mighty good to see him. De slaves allus say, 'I's gwine 'way\r\ntomorrow,' and I guess I's gwine 'way pretty soon tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420195\r\n\r\n\r\n     JERRY BOYKINS, spry and jolly at the age of 92, lived with his aged\r\n     wife in their own cabin at 1015 Plum St., Abilene, Texas. He was\r\n     born a slave to John Thomas Boykin, Troupe Co., Georgia, 80 miles\r\n     from Lagrange, Ga. His master was a very wealthy plantation owner,\r\n     working 1,000 slaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I been well taken care of durin' my life. When I was young I lived\r\nright in de big house with my marster. I was houseboy. My mother's name\r\nwas Betsy Ann Boykin and she was cook for Old Missus. My grandpa was\r\nblacksmith. I slept on a pallet in de kitchen and in winter time on cold\r\nnights I 'members how cold I would get. I'd wake up and slip in by\r\nmarsters bed and den I'd say, 'Marster John, I's about to freeze.' He'd\r\nsay, 'You ought to freeze, you little black devil. What you standin'\r\ndere for?' I'd say, 'Please, marster John, jes' let me crawl in by your\r\nfeet.' He'd say, 'Well, I will dis one time,' and dat's de way I'd do\r\nevery cold night.\r\n\r\n\"I was full of mischief and I'd tu'n de mules out of de lot, jus' to see\r\nde stableboy git a lickin'. One time I wanted a fiddle a white man named\r\nCocoanut Harper kep' tryin' to sell me for $7.50. I didn' never have any\r\nmoney, 'cept a little the missie give me, so I kep' teasin' her to buy\r\nde fiddle for me. She was allus on my side, so she tol' me to take some\r\nco'n from de crib and trade in for de fiddle. In de night I slips out\r\nand hitch up de mules and fetched de co'n to old Harper's house and\r\ntraded for dat fiddle. Den I hides out and play it, so's marster wouldn'\r\nfin' out, but he did and he whip all de daylight outta me. When de\r\nmissie try to whip me, I jes' wrop up in her big skirts and she never\r\ncould hurt me much.\r\n\r\n\"I allus ate my meals in de house at de white folks table, after dey\r\ndone et. Iffen I couldn' sit in de marster's chair, I'd swell up like a\r\ntoad.\r\n\r\n\"De marster done all de whippin', 'cause dey had been two overseers\r\nkilled on de plantation for whippin' slaves till de blood run out dey\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\"Was I bovered with haints and spooks? I been meetin' up with 'em all my\r\nlife. When I was younger I was such an old scratch I'd meet 'em right in\r\nde road, some without heads. I'd take to my heels and then I'd stop and\r\nlook 'round and they'd be gone.\r\n\r\n\"I wore home-weaved shirts till I was grown, then I had some pants and\r\ndey was homemade, too. The women gathered womack leaves to dye de goods\r\nblack.\r\n\r\n\"I well rec'lects when my marster went to war. He called all us in de\r\nkitchen and telled us he had to go over dere and whip those\r\nsons-of-bitches and would be back 'fore breakfast. He didn' return for\r\ntwo years. I says, 'Marster, we sho' would have waited breakfast on you\r\na long time.' He said, 'Yes; deys de hardes' sons-of-bitches to whip I\r\never had dealins' with.'\r\n\r\n\"When war was over, he called us together and tol' us we were free. He\r\nsaid, 'Now, I'm goin' to give you a big day and after that you can stay\r\nand work for pay or you can go.' So he rolled out two barrels of whiskey\r\nand killed hogs and spread a big day.\r\n\r\n\"I wants to tell you 'bout how we killed hogs in my day. We digged a\r\ndeep pit in de groun' and heated big rocks red hot and filled up de pit\r\nwith water and dropped dem hot rocks in and got de water hot; den we\r\nstuck de hogs and rolled 'em in dat pit.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after I's free a man come for me from Louisville to hire me as\r\nforeman in his cotton mule barn. So I went there and I worked in\r\nKentucky for 18 year. Fifty-one years ago I married my ol' woman, Rachel\r\nTaylor, at Corsicana, Texas, and I think she's jes' as fine as the day I\r\nmarried her. We has six chillen and all works hard for a livin' and we\r\ngot one lil' grandbaby 10 years ol'. She lives here at our house and\r\nwe're educatin' her.\r\n\r\n\"I knows I's goin' to live to be over 100 years ol', 'cause my marster\r\ndone tol' me so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420073\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Monroe Brackins]\r\n\r\n\r\n     MONROE BRACKINS, born in Monroe Co., Mississippi, in 1853, was the\r\n     property of George Reedes. He was brought to Medina County, Texas,\r\n     when two years old. Monroe learned to snare and break mustangs and\r\n     became a cowpuncher. He lives in Hondo, Texas. He has an air of\r\n     pride and self-respect, and explained that he used little dialect\r\n     because he learned to talk from the \"white folks\" as he was growing\r\n     up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was bo'n in Mississippi, Monroe County. I'm 84 years old. My master,\r\nGeorge Reedes, brought me, my father and mother and my two sisters to\r\nTexas when I was two years old. My father was Nelson Brackins and my\r\nmother was Rosanna.\r\n\r\n\"My master settled here at a place called Malone, on the Hondo River. He\r\nwent into the stock business. Our house there was a little, old picket\r\nhouse with a grass roof over it out of the sage grass. The bed was made\r\nwith a tick of shucks and the children slept on the floor. The boss had\r\njust a little lumber house. Later on he taken us about 20 miles fu'ther\r\ndown on the Hondo, the Old Adams Ranch, and he had a rock house.\r\n\r\n\"I was about six years old then. I had some shoes, to keep the thorns\r\nouta my feet, and I had rawhide leggin's. We just had such clothes as we\r\ncould get, old patched-up clothes. They just had that jeans cloth,\r\nhomemade clothes.\r\n\r\n\"I was with George Reedes 10 or 12 years. It was my first trainin'\r\nlearnin' the stock business and horse breakin.' He was tol'able good to\r\nus, to be slaves as we was. His brother had a hired man that whipped me\r\nonce, with a quirt. I've heard my father and mother tell how they\r\nwhipped 'em. They'd tie 'em down on a log or up to a post and whip 'em\r\ntill the blisters rose, then take a paddle and open 'em up and pour salt\r\nin 'em. Yes'm, they whipped the women. The most I remember about that,\r\nmy father and sister was in the barn shuckin' co'n and the master come\r\nin there and whipped my sister with a cowhide whip. My father caught a\r\nlick in the face and he told the master to keep his whip offen him. So\r\nthe master started on my father and he run away. When he finally come in\r\nhe was so wild his master had to call him to get orders for work, and\r\nfinally the boss shot at him, but they didn't whip him any more. Of\r\ncourse, some of 'em whipped with more mercy. They had a whippin' post\r\nand when they strapped 'em down on a log they called it a 'stroppin'\r\nlog.'\r\n\r\n\"I remember they tasked the cotton pickers in Mississippi. They had to\r\nbring in so many pounds in the evenin' and if they didn't they got a\r\nwhippin' for it. My sister there, she had to bring in 900 pounds a day.\r\nWell, cotton was heavier there. Most any of 'em could pick 900 pounds.\r\nIt was heavier and fluffier. We left the cotton country in Mississippi,\r\nbut nobody knew anything about cotton out here that I knew of.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard my parents say too, them men that had plantations and a\r\ngreat lot of slaves, they would speculate with 'em and would have a\r\nchain that run from the front ones to the back ones. Sometimes they\r\nwould have 15 or 20 miles to make to get them to the sale place, but\r\nthey couldn't make a break. Where they expected to make a sale, they\r\nkept 'em in corrals and they had a block there to put 'em up on and bid\r\n'em off. The average price was about $500, but some that had good\r\npractice, like a blacksmith, brought a good price, as high as $1,500.\r\n\r\n\"I heard my mother and father say they would go 15 or 20 miles to a\r\ndance, walkin', and get back before daylight, before the 'padderollers'\r\ngot 'em. The slaves would go off when they had no permission and them\r\nthat would ketch 'em and whip 'em was the 'padderollers.' Sometimes they\r\nwould have an awful race.\r\n\r\n\"If they happened to be a slave on the plantation that could jes' read a\r\nlittle print, they would get rid of him right now. He would ruin the\r\nniggers, they would get too smart. The' was no such thing as school here\r\nfor culluds in early days. The white folks we was raised up with had\r\npretty good education. That's why I don't talk like most cullud folks. I\r\nwas about grown and the' was an English family settled close, about half\r\na mile, I guess. They had a little boy, his name was Arthur Ederle, and\r\nhe come over and learned me how to spell 'cat' and 'dog' and 'hen' and\r\nsuch like. I was right around about 20 years old. I couldn't sign my\r\nname when I was 18 years old.\r\n\r\n\"I can remember one time when I was young, I saw something I couldn't\r\n'magine what it was, like a billygoat reared up on a tree. But I knew\r\nthe' wasn't a billygoat round there near, nor no other kinds of goats.\r\nIt was in the daytime and I was out in a horse pasture, I was jes'\r\nwalkin' along, huntin', when I saw that sight. I guess I got within 50\r\nsteps of it, then I turned around and got away. I never did think much\r\nabout a ghost, but I think it could be possible.\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember scarcely anything about the war because I was so\r\nlittle and times was so different; the country wasn't settled up and\r\neverything was wild, no people, hardly. Of course, my life was in the\r\nwoods, you might say, didn't hardly know when Sunday come.\r\n\r\n\"The northern soldiers never did get down in here that I know of. I know\r\nonce, when they was enlisting men to go to battle a whole lot of 'em\r\ndidn't want to fight and would run away and dodge out, and they would\r\nfollow 'em and try to make 'em fight. They had a battle up here on the\r\nNueces once and killed some of 'em. I know my boss was in the bunch that\r\nfollowed 'em and he got scared for fear this old case would be brought\r\nup after the war. The company that followed these men was called Old\r\nDuff Company. I think somewhere around 40 was in the bunch that they\r\nfollowed, but I don't know how many was killed. They was a big bluff and\r\na big water hole and they said they was throwed in that big water hole.\r\n\r\n\"We had possums and 'coons to eat sometimes. My father, he gen'rally\r\ncooked the 'coons, he would dress 'em and stew 'em and then bake 'em. My\r\nmother wouldn't eat them. There was plenty of rabbits, too. Sometimes\r\nwhen they had potatoes they cooked 'em with 'em. I remember one time\r\nthey had just a little patch of blackhead sugar cane. After the freedom,\r\nmy mother had a kind of garden and she planted snap beans and\r\nwatermelons pretty much every year.\r\n\r\n\"The master fed us tol'bly well. Everything was wild, beef was free,\r\njust had to bring one in and kill it. Once in awhile, of a Sunday\r\nmornin', we'd get biscuit flour bread to eat. It was a treat to us. They\r\nmeasured the flour out and it had to pan out just like they measured. He\r\ngive us a little somethin' ever' Christmas and somethin' good to eat. I\r\nheard my people say coffee was high, at times, and I know we didn't get\r\nno flour, only Sunday mornin'. We lived on co'nbread, mostly, and beef\r\nand game outta the woods. That was durin' the war and after the war,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\"I was around about 6 or 7 years old when we was freed. We worked for\r\nGeorge Reedes awhile, then drifted on down to the Frio river and stayed\r\nthere about a year, then we come to Medina County and settled here close\r\nto where I was raised. We didn't think it hard times at all right after\r\nthe war. The country was wild and unsettled, with ranches 15 or 20 miles\r\napart. You never did see anybody and we didn't know really what was\r\ngoin' on in the rest of the country. Sometimes something could happen in\r\n5 miles of us and we didn't know it for a month.\r\n\r\n\"I was on the Adams Ranch on the Hondo when my master come out and told\r\nus we were as free as he was. He said we could stay on and work or could\r\ngo if we wanted to. He gave my mother and father 50 cents apiece and 25\r\ncents for the children. We stayed awhile and then went west to the Frio.\r\n\r\n\"I used to be along with old man Big-foot Wallace in my early days. He\r\nwas a mighty fine man. I worked for the people that was gathering stock\r\ntogether there. Big Foot raised nice horses, old reg'lar Texas horses,\r\nand they was better than the reg'lar old Spanish bronco. I used to go to\r\nhis camp down on the San Miguel. He lived in one part and his chickens\r\nin the rest of his house. His friends liked to hear him talk about his\r\ntravels. He used to run stock horses and had a figger 7 on the left\r\nshoulder for his brand and the tip of each ear split was his earmark.\r\n\r\n\"The last man I broke horses for was Wilson Bailey. I was there about 12\r\nyears. He raised just cavi-yard--we called it a cavi-yard of horses,\r\njust the same thing as a _remuda_. We called 'em that later, but we got\r\nthat from the Spanish. We would get up in a tree with our loop till the\r\nhorse come under and drop it down on him. When they were so spoilt, we\r\ngot 'em in a sort of cavi-yard and drove 'em under trees and caught 'em\r\nin a snare. We had lots of wild horses, just this side of Pearsall.\r\n'Bout the only way I'd get throwed was to get careless. We'd ketch 'im\r\nup, hackamore 'im up, saddle 'im up and get on 'im and let 'im go.\r\nSometimes he'd be too wild to pitch, he'd break and run and you had to\r\nlet 'im run himself down. I used to rather ketch up a wild horse and\r\nbreak 'im than to eat breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"When I first started farmin' I taken up some state land, about 80\r\nacres, down on Black Creek, in Medina County. I stayed there ten or\r\ntwelve years. Cotton hadn't got in this country and I raised some corn,\r\nsugar cane and watermelons. I commenced with horses, but 'long 'way down\r\nthe line I used oxen some, too. I used one of those old walking plows.\r\n\r\n\"I sold that place and moved to a place on the Tywaukney Creek\r\n(Tonkawa). I come up to church and met my wife then. Her name was Ida\r\nBradley and I was 38 years old. We lived down on the Tywaukney right\r\nabout 23 years and raised our children there. We jes' had a little home\r\nweddin'. I wore a suit, dark suit. We got married about 8 o'clock in the\r\nevenin' and we had barbecue, cake and ice cream. You see, in them times\r\nI wasn't taught anything about years and dates, but I judge it was about\r\n25 years after the war before I settled on the Tywaukney.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420310\r\n\r\n\r\n     GUS BRADSHAW was born about 1845, at Keecheye, Alabama, a slave of\r\n     David Cavin. He recalls being brought to Texas in the 1850's, when\r\n     the Cavin family settled near old Port Caddo. Gus remained with his\r\n     master for ten years after emancipation. He now lives alone on a\r\n     fifty acre farm seven miles northeast of Marshall, which he bought\r\n     in 1877. Gus receives an $11.00 per month pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was born at Keecheye, Alabama, and belonged to old man David Cavin.\r\nThe only statement I can make 'bout my age is I knows I was 'bout twenty\r\nyears old when us slaves was freed. I never knowed my daddy, but my\r\nmammy was Amelia Cavin. I's heard her say she's born in Alabama more\r\ntimes than I got fingers and toes. Our old master brung us to Texas when\r\nI's a good sized kid. I 'members like it am yesterday, how we camped\r\nmore'n a week in New Orleans. I seed 'em sell niggers off the block\r\nthere jus' like they was cattle. Then we came to old Port Caddo on Caddo\r\nLake and master settles a big farm close to where the boats run. Port\r\nCaddo was a big shipping place then, and Dud and John Perry run the\r\nfirst store there. The folks hauled cotton there from miles away.\r\n\r\n\"Mammy's folks was named Maria and Joe Gloster and they come to Texas\r\nwith the Cavins. My grandma say to me, 'Gus, don't run you mouth too\r\nmuch and allus have manners to whites and blacks.' Chillen was raise\r\nright then, but now they come up any way. I seed young niggers turn the\r\ndipper up and drink 'fore old folks. I wouldn't dare do that when I's\r\ncomin' up.\r\n\r\n\"Maria say to me one day, 'Son, I's here when the stars fell.' She tell\r\nme they fell like a sheet and spread over the ground. Ike Hood, the old\r\nblacksmith on our place, he told me, too. I says, 'Ike, how old was you\r\nwhen the stars fell?' He say, 'I's thirty-two.'\r\n\r\n\"Massa David had big quarters for us niggers, with chimneys and\r\nfireplaces. They use to go round and pick up old hawg or cow bones to\r\nbile with greens and cabbage. They was plenty of wild game, and deer and\r\nwolves howlin' right through this country, but you can't even find the\r\ntrack of one now.\r\n\r\n\"The first work I done was pickin' cotton. Every fellow was out at\r\ndaylight pickin' cotton or hoein' or plowin'. They was one overseer and\r\ntwo nigger drivers. But at night you could hear us laughin' and talkin'\r\nand singin' and prayin', and hear them fiddles and things playin'. It\r\nlook like darkies git 'long more better then than now. Some folks says\r\nniggers oughtn't to be slaves, but I says they ought, 'cause they jus'\r\nwon't do right onless they is made to do it.\r\n\r\n\"Massa David allus give us eggnog and plenty good whiskey at Christmas.\r\nWe had all day to eat and drink and sing and dance. We didn't git no\r\npresents, but we had a good time.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know much 'bout the war, only Massa Bob Perry come over one day\r\nand say to Grandma Maria, 'They is surrender, Maria, you is free.' She\r\nsay to him, 'I don't care, I gwine stay with my white folks.'\r\n\r\n\"The Klu Klux done lots of cuttin' up round there. Two of 'em come to\r\nDr. Taylor's house. He had two niggers what run off from the Klux and\r\nthey want to whip 'em, but Dr. Taylor wouldn't 'low 'em. I knowed old\r\nCol. Alford, one of the Klux leaders, and he was a sight. He told me\r\nonce, 'Gus, they done send me to the pen for Kluxing.' I say, 'Massa\r\nAlford, didn't they make a gentleman of you?' He say, 'Hell, no!'\r\n\r\n\"I knowed old Col. Haggerdy, too. He marries a widow of a rich old\r\nIndian chief, name McIntosh. He broke a treaty with his people and had\r\nto hide out in a cave a long time, and his wife brung food to him. One\r\ntime when she went to the cave he was gone. She knowed then the Indians\r\ndone git him and kilt him for vi'latin' the treaty. So she marries old\r\nCol. Haggerdy.\r\n\r\n\"The only time I votes was against whiskey. I voted for it. Some white\r\nfolks done say they'd whip me if I voted for it, but Mr. Joe Strickland\r\ndone told me they jus' tryin' scare me, so I voted for it. I don't think\r\nniggers ought to vote. If some niggers had things in hand 'stead of\r\nwhite folks, I couldn't stay here. These eddicated niggers am causin'\r\nthe devilment. The young niggers ain't got no 'spect for old age.\r\n\r\n\"I bought and paid for fifty acres land here in Harrison County and I\r\nhas lived on it sixty years. I lived with my wife fifty years 'fore she\r\ndied and done raise two chillen. These young niggers don't stay married\r\nfifty days, sometimes. I don't mess with 'em, but if I needs help I goes\r\nto the white folks. If you 'have youself, they allus help you if you\r\nneeds it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420240\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wes Brady]\r\n\r\n\r\n     WES BRADY, 88, was born a slave of John Jeems, who had a farm five\r\n     miles north of Marshall. Wes has farmed in Harrison County all his\r\n     life. He now lives with friends on the Long's Camp Road, and draws\r\n     a $11.00 monthly pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was born and raised in Harrison County, and I was eighty-eight years\r\nold this July past and has wore myself out here in this county. I was\r\nborn on Massa John Jeem's place, on the old Jefferson Road, and my\r\nfather was Peter Calloway, and he was born in Alabama and his whole\r\nfam'ly brought to Texas by nigger traders. My mother was Harriet Ellis\r\nand I had two brothers named George and Andrew, and four sisters, Lula\r\nand Judy and Mary and Sallie. My old Grandpa Phil told me how he helped\r\nrun the Indians off the land.\r\n\r\n\"Grandpa Phil told me 'bout meetin' his massa. Massa Jeems had three or\r\nfour places and grandpa hadn't seed him and he went to one of the other\r\nfarms and meets a man goin' down the road. The man say, 'Who you belong\r\nto?' Grandpa Phil say, 'Massa Jeems.' The man say, 'Is he a mean man?'\r\nGrandpa say, 'I don't know him, but they say he's purty tight.' It was\r\nMassa Jeems talkin' and he laughs and gives Grandpa Phil five dollars.\r\n\r\n\"We niggers lived in log houses and slep' on hay mattress with lowell\r\ncovers, and et fat pork and cornbread and 'lasses and all kinds garden\r\nstuff. If we et flour bread, our women folks had to slip the flour\r\nsiftin's from missy's kitchen and darsn't let the white folks know it.\r\nWe wore one riggin' lowell clothes a year and I never had shoes on till\r\nafter surrender come. I run all over the place till I was a big chap in\r\njes' a long shirt with a string tied round the bottom for a belt. I went\r\nwith my young massa that way when he hunted in the woods, and toted\r\nsquirrels for him.\r\n\r\n\"Some white folks might want to put me back in slavery if I tells how we\r\nwas used in slavery time, but you asks me for the truth. The overseer\r\nwas 'straddle his big horse at three o'clock in the mornin', roustin'\r\nthe hands off to the field. He got them all lined up and then come back\r\nto the house for breakfas'. The rows was a mile long and no matter how\r\nmuch grass was in them, if you leaves one sprig on your row they beats\r\nyou nearly to death. Lots of times they weighed cotton by candlelight.\r\nAll the hands took dinner to the field in buckets and the overseer give\r\nthem fifteen minutes to git dinner. He'd start cuffin' some of them over\r\nthe head when it was time to stop eatin' and go back to work. He'd go to\r\nthe house and eat his dinner and then he'd come back and look in all the\r\nbuckets and if a piece of anything that was there when he left was et,\r\nhe'd say you was losin' time and had to be whipped. He'd drive four\r\nstakes in the ground and tie a nigger down and beat him till he's raw.\r\nThen he'd take a brick and grind it up in a powder and mix it with lard\r\nand put it all over him and roll him in a sheet. It'd be two days or\r\nmore 'fore that nigger could work 'gain. I seed one nigger done that way\r\nfor stealin' a meat bone from the meathouse. That nigger got fifteen\r\nhundred lashes. The li'l chaps would pick up egg shells and play with\r\nthem and if the overseer seed them he'd say you was stealin' eggs and\r\ngive you a beatin'. I seed long lines of slaves chained together driv by\r\na white man on a hoss, down the Jefferson road.\r\n\r\n\"The first work I done was drappin' corn, and then cow-pen boy and sheep\r\nherder. All us house chaps had to shell a half bushel corn every night\r\nfor to feed the sheep. Many times I has walked through the quarters when\r\nI was a little chap, cryin' for my mother. We mos'ly only saw her on\r\nSunday. Us chillen was in bed when the folks went to the field and come\r\nback. I 'members wakin' up at night lots of times and seein' her make a\r\nlittle mush on the coals in the fireplace, but she allus made sho' that\r\noverseer was asleep 'fore she done that.\r\n\r\n\"One time the stock got in the field and the overseer 'cuses a old man\r\nand jumps on him and breaks his neck. When he seed the old man dead, he\r\nrun off to the woods, but massa sent some nigger after him and say for\r\nhim to come back, the old man jus' got overhet and died.\r\n\r\n\"We went to church on the place and you ought to heared that preachin'.\r\nObey your massa and missy, don't steal chickens and eggs and meat, but\r\nnary a word 'bout havin' a soul to save.\r\n\r\n\"We had parties Saturday nights and massa come out and showed us new\r\nsteps. He allus had a extra job for us on Sunday, but he gave us\r\nChristmas Day and all the meat we wanted. But if you had money you'd\r\nbetter hide it, 'cause he'd git it.\r\n\r\n\"The fightin' was did off from us. My father went to war to wait on Josh\r\nCalloway. My father never come back. Massa Jeems cussed and 'bused us\r\nniggers more'n ever, but he took sick and died and stepped off to Hell\r\n'bout six months 'fore we got free. When we was free, they beat drums in\r\nMarshall. I stayed on 'bout seven months and then my mother and me went\r\nto farmin' for ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"I wore myself out right in this county and now I'm too old to work.\r\nThese folks I lives with takes good care of me and the gov'ment gives me\r\n$11.00 a month what I is proud to git.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420165\r\n\r\n\r\n     JACOB BRANCH, about 86, was a slave of the Van Loos family, in\r\n     Louisiana, who sold him when a baby to Elisha Stevenson, of Double\r\n     Bayou, Texas. Jacob helps his son, Enrichs, farm, and is unusually\r\n     agile for his age. They live in the Double Bayou settlement, near\r\n     Beaumont, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I's bought and fotched here to Double Bayou when I's jes' three year\r\nold. I and my half-brother, Eleck, he de baby, was both born in\r\nLouisiana on de Van Loos place, but I go by de name of Branch, 'cause my\r\ndaddy name Branch. My mama name Renee. Dey split up us family and Elisha\r\nStevenson buy my mama and de two chillen. I ain't never see my daddy no\r\nmore and don't 'member him at all.\r\n\r\n\"Old 'Lisha Stevenson he a great one for to raise pigs. He sell sometime\r\n500 hawgs at one time. He take he dogs and drive dem hawgs 'cross de\r\nNeches River all by hisself, to sell dem. Dat how he git money to buy de\r\nniggers, sellin' hawgs and cowhides.\r\n\r\n\"Old massa he sho' a good old man, but de old missy, she a tornado! Her\r\nname Miss 'Liza. She could be terrible mean. But sometime she take her\r\nold morrel--dat a sack make for to carry things in--and go out and come\r\nback with plenty joints of sugar cane. She take a knife and sit on de\r\ngallary and peel dat cane and give a joint to every one de li'l chillen.\r\n\r\n\"Mama, she work up in de big house, doin' cookin' and washin'. Old massa\r\ngo buy a cullud man name Uncle Charley Fenner. He a good old cullud man.\r\nMassa brung him to de quarters and say, 'Renee, here you husband,' and\r\nden he turn to Uncle and say, 'Charley, dis you woman.' Den dey\r\nconsider marry. Dat de way dey marry den, by de massa's word. Uncle\r\nCharley, he good step-pa to us.\r\n\r\n\"De white folks have de good house with a brick chimney. Us quarters de\r\ngood, snug li'l house with flue and oven. Dey didn't bother to have much\r\nfurn'chure, 'cause us in dere only to sleep. Us have homemake bench and\r\n'Georgia Hoss' bed with hay mattress. All us cookin' and eatin' done in\r\nde kitchen de big house. Us have plenty to eat, too. De smokehouse allus\r\nfull white 'taters and cracklin's hangin' on de wall. Us git dem mos'\r\nany time us want, jes' so long us didn't waste nothin'. Dey have big jar\r\nwith buttermilk and 'low us drink all us want.\r\n\r\n\"Old lady 'Liza, she have three women to spin when she git ready make de\r\nclothes for everybody. Dey spin and weave and make all us clothes. Us\r\nall wear shirt tail till us 'bout twelve or fourteen, boys and gals,\r\ntoo. You couldn't tell us apart.\r\n\r\n\"Us chillen start to work soon's us could toddle. First us gather\r\nfirewood. Iffen it freezin' or hot us have to go to toughen us up. When\r\nus git li'l bigger us tend de cattle and feed hosses and hawgs. By time\r\nus good sprouts us pickin' cotton and pullin' cane. Us ain't never idle.\r\nSometime us git far out in de field and lay down in de corn row and nap.\r\nBut, Lawdy, iffen dey cotch you, dey sho' wore you out! Sunday de\r\nonliest rest day and den de white folks 'low us play.\r\n\r\n\"Massa never whup Uncle Charley, 'cause he good nigger and work hard. It\r\nmake missy mad and one time when massa gone she go down in de field.\r\nUncle Charley hoein' corn jes' like massa done told him, jes' singin'\r\nand happy. Old missy she say, 'Nigger, I's sho gwineter whup you.' He\r\nsay, 'What for you whup me. I doin' every bit what old massa done tell\r\nme.' But missy think he gittin' it too good, 'cause he ain't never been\r\nwhupped. She clumb over de fence and start down de row with de cowhide.\r\nUncle Charley, he ain't even raise he voice, but he cut de las' weed\r\nouten dat corn and commence to wave he hoe in de air, and he say,\r\n'Missy, I ain't 'vise you come any step closeter.' Dat sho' make her\r\nmad, but she 'fraid to do nothin'.\r\n\r\n\"One time she have 'nother nigger name Charlie. Massa go on de trip and\r\nshe tell dis Charley iffen he ain't finish grindin' all de cornmeal by\r\nMonday she gwineter give him a t'ousand lashes. He try, but he ain't\r\nable make dat much meal, so come Monday he runned off in de bayou. Dat\r\nnight come de big freeze and he down dere with water up to he knees and\r\nwhen massa come home and go git him, he so froze he couldn't walk. Dey\r\nbrung him in de kitchen and old missy cuss him out. Soon's he thaw out,\r\nhe done die right dere on de spot.\r\n\r\n\"My pore mama! Every washday old missy give her de beatin'. She couldn't\r\nkeep de flies from speckin' de clothes overnight. Old missy git up soon\r\nin de mornin', 'fore mama have time git dem specks off. She snort and\r\nsay, 'Renee, I's gwineter teach you how to wash.' Den she beat mama with\r\nde cowhide. Look like she cut my mama in two. Many's de time I edges up\r\nand tries take some dem licks off my mama.\r\n\r\n\"Slavery, one to 'nother, was purty rough. Every plantation have to\r\nanswer for itself.\r\n\r\n\"I used to know lots of songs, but I don't know many now. Spiritual\r\nsongs, dey comes through visions. Dat's why cullud folks can make dem\r\nbetter dan white folks. I knowed one song what start out--\r\n\r\n\"'De Jews done kill pore Jesus,\r\nAnd bury him in de sepulchur;\r\nDe grave wouldn't hold him,\r\nDey place guards all 'round him,\r\nBut de angels move de stone,\r\nDe Jews done kill pore Jesus,\r\nBut de grave it wouldn't hold him.'\r\n\r\n\"Dey 'nother song what say--\r\n\r\n\"'Run, sinner, run,\r\nGawd is a-callin' you.\r\nRun, sinner, run,\r\nDe fire'll overtake you.'\r\n\r\n\"When I 'bout ten dey sets me ginnin' cotton. Old massa he done make de\r\ncotton with de hand crank. It built on a bench like. I gin de cotton by\r\nturnin' dat crank. When I gits a lapful I puts it in de tow sack and dey\r\ntake it to Miss Susan to make de twine with it. I warm and damp de\r\ncotton 'fore de fireplace 'fore I start ginnin' it.\r\n\r\n\"Dere school for de white chillen in Double Bayou and I used to go meet\r\nde chillen comin' home and dey stop longside de way and teach me my ABC.\r\nDey done carry me as far as Baker in de book when old missy find it out\r\nand make dem stop. De war comin' on den and us daren't even pick up a\r\npiece of paper. De white folks didn't want us to larn to read for fear\r\nus find out things.\r\n\r\n\"Us livin' down by de Welborn's den and I seed dem haul de logs out of\r\nPine Island to make dat Welborn house. Old man Hamshire and old man\r\nRemington builded dat Welborn house. It 'cross de bayou, left hand side\r\nSmith's ferry. Dat house still standin' in parts.\r\n\r\n\"One mornin' Eleck and me git up at crack of dawn to milk. All at once\r\ncome a shock what shake de earth. De big fish jump clean out de bay and\r\nturtles and alligators run out dere ponds. Dey plumb ruint Galveston!\r\nUs runned in de house and all de dishes and things done jump out de\r\nshelf. Dat de first bombardment of Galveston. De sojers put powder under\r\npeople's houses and blowin' up Galveston.\r\n\r\n\"Young massa Shake Stevenson he vol'teer and git kilt somewheres in\r\nVirginny. Young massa Tucker Stevenson, he ain't 'lieve in war and he\r\nsay he never gwine fight. He hide in de woods so de conscrip' men can't\r\nfind him. Old man LaCour come 'round and say he have orders for find\r\nTucker and bring him in dead or 'live. But 'cause he old massa's friend,\r\nhe say, 'Why don't you buy de boy's services off?' So old massa take de\r\nboat, 'Catrig,' us calls it, and loads it with corn and sich and us pole\r\nit down to Galveston. De people need dat food so much, dat load supplies\r\ndone buy off Massa Tucker from fightin'.\r\n\r\n\"After war starts lots of slaves runned off to git to de Yankees. All\r\ndem in dis part heads for de Rio Grande river. De Mexicans rig up\r\nflat-boats out in de middle de river, tied to stakes with rope. When de\r\ncullud people gits to de rope dey can pull deyself 'cross de rest de way\r\non dem boats. De white folks rid de 'Merican side dat river all de time,\r\nbut plenty slaves git through, anyway.\r\n\r\n\"I wait on lots of sojers. I have to get smartweed and bile it in salt\r\nwater to bath dem in. Dat help de rheumatism. Dem sojers have rheumatism\r\nso bad for standin' day and night in de water.\r\n\r\n\"Us sho' in good health dem days. Iffen a cullud man weak dey move de\r\nmuscles in he arms, bleed him and give him plenty bacon and cornbread,\r\nand he git so strong he could lift a log. Dey didn't go in for cuttin',\r\nlike dey do now. Dey git herbs out de woods, blue mass and quinine and\r\ncalomel. I think people jes' die under pills, now. Old lady Field she\r\nmake medicine with snakeroot and larkspur and marshroot and redroot.\r\n\r\n\"After war am over Massa Tucker brung de freedom papers and read dem. He\r\nsay us all am free as Hell. Old man Charley so happy he jes' roll on de\r\nfloor like a hoss and kick he heels. De nex' mornin' mama start do\r\nsomethin' and missy cuss her out. I runned to missy and say, 'Us free as\r\nde bird.' She sho' whup me for dat, but no more, 'cause she so mean us\r\nall leave.\r\n\r\n\"Dat funny. Old man LaFour, what de head de patterrollers and so mean,\r\nhe de first to help us niggers after freedom. He loan us he ox team and\r\npay Uncle Charley a dollar de day for work and a dollar every time my\r\nmama wash for he wife.\r\n\r\n\"Old massa and missy split up. She so bad she ain't give him no better\r\nshow dan she done us. Old massa gittin' some peaches one day and she\r\ncome after him with de buggy whip. He git on he hoss and say, 'Liz,\r\nyou's gittin' broad as de beef. You too big for me.' She so mad she spit\r\nfire. Lightenin' done kill her, she upstairs and de big streak hits her.\r\nIt knock her under de bed.\r\n\r\n\"De first freedom work I done am pullin' up potato hills at two bits a\r\nhunnerd. 'Bout two bits de most us could make in one day. I work two\r\ndays to buy mama de turkey hen for Christmas. Anything mama want I think\r\nshe got to have. I's growed 'fore I gits much as four bits a day. I's\r\ndone earn as much as $1.50 in my time, though.\r\n\r\n\"When I's 25 year old I marries Betty Baker but she dead now.

William kneels at his bedside each evening at five and says\r\n     his prayers. In this ceremony he spends a half hour or more\r\n     chanting one Negro spiritual after another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Yahsur, I was a slave. I was bo'n May 13, 1850, on the place of Lawyer\r\nWoodson in Lunenburg County, Virginia. It was 'bout 75 miles southwest\r\nof Richmond. They was two big plantations, one on one side the road,\r\nyother the yother. My marster owned 75 slaves. He raised tobacco and\r\ncotton. I wukked tobacco sometime, sometime cotton. Dere wasn't no\r\nwhippin' or switchin'. We had to wuk hard. Marster Woodson was a rich\r\nman. He live in a great big house, a lumber house painted white. And it\r\nhad a great big garden.\r\n\r\n\"De slaves lives in a long string of log houses. Dey had dirt floors and\r\nshingle roofs. Marster Woodson's house was shingle roof too. We had home\r\ncured bacon and veg'tables, dried co'n, string beans and dey give us hoe\r\ncakes baked in hot ashes. Dere always was lots of fresh milk.\r\n\r\n\"How'd us slaves git de clothes? We carded de cotton, den de women spin\r\nit on a spinnin' wheel. After dat day sew de gahment togeddah\r\non a sewin' machine. Yahsur, we's got sewin' machine, wid a big wheel\r\nand a handle. One woman tu'n de handle and de yuther woman do de\r\nsewin'.\r\n\r\n\"Dat's how we git de clothes for de 75 slaves. Marster's clothes? We\r\nmakes dem for de whole fam'ly. De missis send de pattren and de slaves\r\nmakes de clothes. Over nigh Richmond a fren' of Marster Woodson has 300\r\nslaves. Dey makes all de clothes for dem.\r\n\r\n\"I was with Marster twel de Yankees come down to Virginia in 1861. De\r\nsergeant of de Yankees takes me up on his hoss and I goes to Washington\r\nwid de Yankees. I got to stay dere 'cause I'd run away from my marster.\r\n\r\n\"I stay at de house of Marse Frank Cayler. He's an ole time hack driver.\r\nI was his houseboy. I stay dere twel de year 1870, den I goes to\r\nBaltimore and jines de United States Army. We's sent to Texas 'count of\r\nde Indians bein' so bad. Dey put us on a boat at Baltimore and we landed\r\nat Galveston.\r\n\r\n\"Den we marches from Galveston to Fort Duncan. It was up, up, de whole\r\ntime. We ties our bedclothes and rolls dem in a bundle wid a strap. We\r\nwalks wid our guns and bedclothes on our backs, and de wagons wid de\r\nrations follows us. Dey is pulled by mules. We goes 15 miles ev'ry day.\r\nWe got no tents, night come, we unrolls de blankets and sleeps under de\r\ntrees, sometime under de brush.\r\n\r\n\"For rations we got canned beans, milk and hardtack. De hard tacks is 3\r\nor 4 in a box, we wets 'em in water and cooks 'em in a skillet. We gits\r\nmeat purty often. When we camps for de night de captain say, 'You'all\r\nkin go huntin'.' Before we git to de mountains dere's deer and rabbits\r\nand dey ain't no fences. Often in de dark we sees a big animal and we\r\nshoots. When we bring 'im to camp, de captain say, 'Iffen de cow got\r\niron burns de rancher gwineter shoot hisself a nigger scout.' But de cow\r\nain't got no iron, it's--what de name of de cow what ain't feel de iron?\r\nMavrick, yahsur. We eats lots of dem Mavricks. We's goin' 'long de\r\nriver bottom, and before we comes to Fort Duncan we sees de cactus and\r\nmuskeet. Dere ain't much cattle, but one colored scout shoots hisself a\r\nbear. Den we eats high. Fort Duncan were made of slab lumber and de roof\r\nwas gravel and grass.\r\n\r\n\"Den we's ordered to Fort Davis and we's in de mountains now. Climb,\r\nclimb all day, and de Indians give us a fit ev'ry day. We kills some\r\nIndians, dey kills a few soldiers. We was at Fort Clark a while. At Fort\r\nDavis I jines de colored Indian Scouts, I was in Capt. George L.\r\nAndrew's Co. K.\r\n\r\n\"We's told de northern Cheyennes is on a rampus and we's goin' to Fort\r\nSill in Indian Territory. Before we gits to Fort Concho (San Angelo) de\r\nComanches and de Apaches give us a fit. We fitten' 'em all de time and\r\nwhen we gits away from de Comanches and Apaches we fitten de Cheyennes.\r\nDey's seven feet tall. Dey couldn't come through that door.\r\n\r\n\"When we gits to Fort Sill, Gen. Davidson say de Cheyennes is off de\r\nreservation, and he say, 'You boys is got to git dem back. Iffen you\r\nkill 'em, dey can't git back to de reservation.' Den we goes scoutin'\r\nfor de Cheyennes and dey is scoutin' for us. Dey gits us first, on de\r\nWichita River was 500 of 'em, and we got 75 colored Indian Scouts. Den\r\nRed Foot, de Chief of de Cheyennes, he come to see Capt. Lawson and say\r\nhe want rations for his Indians. De captain say he cain't give no\r\nrations to Indians off de reservation. Red Foot say he don't care 'bout\r\nno reservation and he say he take what we got. Capt. Lawson 'low we\r\ngotter git reinforcements. We got a guide in de scout troop, he call\r\nhisself Jack Kilmartin. De captain say, 'Jack, I'se in trouble, how kin\r\nI git a dispatch to Gen. Davidson?' Jack say, 'I kin git it through.'\r\nAnd Jack, he crawl on his belly and through de brush and he lead a pony,\r\nand when he gits clear he rides de pony bareback twel he git to Fort\r\nSill. Den Gen.

But de Cheyennes give 'em a fit\r\nall de way, dey's gotter cut dere way through de Cheyennes.\r\n\r\n\"And Col.

You kill 'em all from de\r\ncradle to de Cross.'\r\n\r\n\"And den we starts de attack. De Cheyennes got Winchesters and rifles\r\nand repeaters from de government. Yahsur, de government give 'em de guns\r\ndey used to shoot us. We got de ole fashion muzzle loaders. You puts one\r\nball in de muzzle and shove de powder down wid de ramrod. Den we went in\r\nand fit 'em, and 'twas like fightin' a wasp's nest. Dey kills a lot of\r\nour boys and we nearly wipes 'em out. Den we disarms de Cheyennes we\r\ncaptures, and turns dere guns in to de regiment.\r\n\r\n\"I come to San Antonio after I'se mustered out and goes to work for de\r\nBell Jewelry Company and stays dere twel I cain't work no more.

The town of Branch was known in slave days as\r\n     Plaquemine Bouley. Clara estimates her age to be 100 or 102, and\r\n     from various facts known to her and her family, this would seem to\r\n     be correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Old massa's name was William Lyons. I didn't have no old missus, 'cause\r\nhe was a bachelor. He had a big plantation. I don't know how big but dey\r\nsomethin' like twenty fam'lies of slaves and some dem fam'lies had\r\nplenty in dem. My ma was Becky Brim and pa, he name Louis Brim. She come\r\nfrom Old Virginny. Dey work in de field. I had two sister name Cass and\r\nDonnie and a brudder name Washington. He went off to de war. When it\r\nbreak out dey come and take him off to work in de army. He lost in dat\r\nwar. He didn't come back. Nobody ever know what happen to him.\r\n\r\n\"Some de houses log house and some plank, but dey all good. Dey well\r\nbuilt and had brick chimneys. Dey houses what de wind didn't blow in. Us\r\nhad beds, too, not dem built in de wall. Us sho' treat good in slavery\r\ntimes, yes, suh. Old massa give us plenty clothes to keep us good and\r\nwarm. He sho' did.\r\n\r\n\"Old massa, he wasn't marry and eat de same things de slaves eat. He\r\ndidn't work dem in de heat of de day. 'Bout eleven o'clock, when dat sun\r\ngit hot, he call dem out de field. He give dem till it git kind of cool\r\nbefo' he make dem go back in de field. He didn't have no overseer. He\r\nseed 'bout de plantation hisself. He raise cotton and corn and sweet\r\n'taters and peas and cane, didn't fool with rice. He didn't go in for\r\noats, neither.\r\n\r\n\"When Sunday come Old Massa ask who want to go to church. Dem what wants\r\ncould ride hoss-back or walk. Us go to de white folks church. Dey sot in\r\nfront and us sot in back. Us had prayer meetin', too, reg'lar every\r\nweek. One old cullud man a sort of preacher. He de leader in 'ligion.\r\n\r\n\"When de slaves go to work he give dem de task. Dat so much work, so\r\nmany rows cotton to chop or corn to hoe. When dey git through dey can do\r\nwhat dey want. He task dem on Monday. Some dem git through Thursday\r\nnight. Den dey can hire out to somebody and git pay for it.\r\n\r\n\"Old Massa even git de preacher for marryin' de slaves. And when a slave\r\ndie, he git de preacher and have Bible readin' and prayin'. Mostest de\r\nmassas didn't do dat-a-way.\r\n\r\n\"I as big in war time as I is now. I used to do anything in de field\r\nwhat de men done. I plow and pull fodder and pick cotton. But de hardes'\r\nwork I ever done am since I free. Old Massa, he didn't work us hard,\r\nnoway.\r\n\r\n\"He allus give us de pass, so dem patterrollers not cotch us. Dey 'bout\r\nsix men on hoss-back, ridin' de roads to cotch niggers what out without\r\nde pass. Iffen dey cotch him it am de whippin'. But de niggers on us\r\nplace was good and civ'lized folks. Dey didn't have no fuss. Old Massa\r\nallus let dem have de garden and dey can raise things to eat and sell.\r\nSometime dey have some pig and chickens.\r\n\r\n\"I been marry his' one time and he been dead 'bout forty-one years now.\r\nI stay with Old Massa long time after freedom. In 1913 I come live with\r\nmy youngest girl here in Beaumont. You see, I can't 'member so much.

The old Negro's memory is poor, but he managed to\r\n     recall a few incidents of slave days. He lives in Mart, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I's born 'bout de year 1850, near de Tom Bigbee river in Alabama, on a\r\nplantation own by Marse Josiah Collier. My folks was Henderson and\r\nMartha Brooks and I's de only child den.\r\n\r\n\"Marse Collier owned seventy fam'lies of slaves and dey all lived in dey\r\nquarters 'bout a mile from de big house. When freedom come Marse Collier\r\nsent for all de slaves and lines us up in a row, two deep, and helt up\r\nhe hands and say, 'Boys, you is free as I is. All of you what wants to\r\ncan go, and all of you what wants to can work for me on wages dis year.\r\nNext year I'll give you a crop or work for wages.' Dey all stays but\r\ntwo, and one of dem two my daddy, and he lef' mammy and six chillen and\r\nnever come back.\r\n\r\n\"Us stays on till Marse Collier and Missus both dies, and den stays with\r\nhe oldes' gal, and didn't go 'way till we's growed and has fam'lies of\r\nour own.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members best de Fourth of July. De white folks have lots to eat for\r\ndem and us and we plays games and goes swimmin'.\r\n\r\n\"Next thing I 'members is de patterrollers, 'cause dey whip me every\r\ntime dey cotches me without my pass. Dat de way dey make us stay home at\r\nnight, and it made good niggers out of us, 'cause we couldn't chase\r\nround and git in no meanness.\r\n\r\n\"Old Marse often told me 'bout de stars fallin'. It was 'long 'bout\r\nsundown and growed dark all a sudden and de chickens goes to roost. Den\r\nsome stars with long tails 'gins to shoot, den it look like all de\r\nstars had come out of Heaven, and did dey fall! De stars not all what\r\nfell. De white folks and de niggers fell on dere knees, prayin' to Gawd\r\nto save dem iffen de world comin' to a end, and de women folks all run\r\ndown in de cellar and stayed till mornin'. Old Marse say it was in 1833,\r\nand he say dem stars fall awhile and quit awhile, like de showers when\r\nit rains.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout a year after freedom Old Marse give us a piece of land for a\r\nchurch and dis was de school, too. De preacher's name was Christmas\r\nCrawford, and dat de reason I 'members it, it so funny to us. De nigger\r\nteacher named Nimron. De niggers has de blueback spellers and larns\r\n'rithmetic, too.\r\n\r\n\"On Thanksgivin' Day de niggers goes round to de white folks houses and\r\ngives a ser'nade, like dis:\r\n\r\n\"'De old bee make de honeycomb,\r\n  De young bee make de honey--\r\n  De nigger make de cotton and corn,\r\n  And de white folks git de money.\r\n\r\n\"'De raccoon he a curious man,\r\n  He never works till dark;\r\n  Nothin' ever 'sturbs he mind,\r\n  Till he hear old Towser bark.'\r\n\r\n\"Den de white folks asks us in and help ourselves to de cake or wine or\r\nwhatever dey has, and we does dis on Christmas, too.\r\n\r\n\"We had a song we'd sing when we's thinkin' of comin' to Texas:\r\n\r\n\"'We'll put for de South, for seven-up and loo,\r\n  Chime in, niggers, won't you come 'long, too?\r\n  No use talkin' when de nigger wants to go,\r\n  Where de corn top blossoms and canebrakes grow.\r\n  Come 'long, Cuba, and dance de polka juba,\r\n  Way down South, where de corn tops grow.'\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to be in old Alabama to die, but Old Marse and Missus gone,\r\nand it ain't no use goin' dere no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420014\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Donaville Broussard]\r\n\r\n\r\n     DONAVILLE BROUSSARD, a polished gentleman of his race, was the son\r\n     of a mulatto slave of Emilier Caramouche. He was born in 1850, but\r\n     appears vigorous. Light skinned, with blue eyes and a genial\r\n     expression, he gave the story of his life in the French patois\r\n     spoken by Louisiana French Negroes, which has been translated into\r\n     English.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My mama was daughter of one of the Carmouche boys. One of M'sieur\r\nFrancois' sons. She call herself Armance Carmouche. She was house\r\nservant for the family and I worked around the house. I remember my\r\nMadame brought me the little basket and it had a strap on it. I put the\r\nstrap over the shoulder and went round with the sharp stick and picked\r\nup the leaves on the ground with the stick.\r\n\r\n\"It was a great house with trees and flowers. Madame liked all clean and\r\npretty. I never worked hard. The ladies and my mama, too, petted me as\r\nif I was the white child.\r\n\r\n\"M'sieur had a widow sister. She made us learn the prayers. We were glad\r\nto go where she was for she always had something good in her bag for us.\r\nI never saw the baptizing. In those days all the slaves had the religion\r\nof the master and the Catholics didn't have no baptizing. They didn't\r\nhave to half-drown when they got their religion. The church was 15 or 20\r\nmiles off. The priest came and held Mass for the white folks sometimes.\r\n\r\n\"I remember one wedding. My aunt got married. M'sieur Caramouche killed\r\na big pig. The white folks ate in the house. The slaves sat under the\r\ntrees and ate in the yard. At four o'clock the justice of the peace\r\ncame. He was the friend of M'sieur Caramouche. He made my aunt and the\r\nman hold hands and jump over the broom handle. When the priest came he\r\nmade M'sieur sign some papers.\r\n\r\n\"A slave always had to ask M'sieur to marry. He always let the women\r\nslaves marry who they wanted. He didn't loose by that. He was so good\r\nthe men would come to his plantation.\r\n\r\n\"We all wore the long chemise. Made out of heavy cloth. They made the\r\ncloth on the place and the women sewed it up. We didn't wear the shoes.\r\nWe didn't like them when we had them.\r\n\r\n\"Each slave could have the little garden. They raised vegetables and had\r\na couple of beehives for the honey.\r\n\r\n\"When the Yankees came they told us we could be free, but I don't know\r\nof any slaves that left. Old M'sieur died of the fever in the second\r\nyear of the war. His wife died before he did. No children. They sold us,\r\nthe house and everything. M'sieur Cyprien Arceneaux of Lafayette bought\r\nme and Madame Arvillien Bernard of St. Pierre bought the mama. They used\r\nto call it St. Pierre. They call it Carenero now. When war was finished\r\nI left M'sieur Arceneaux and lived with mama.\r\n\r\n\"A year and a half after that the mama married a black man and us three\r\nfarmed the little farm. My steppapa didn't like me. I was light. He and\r\nme couldn't get along. So when I had 20 years I left there and hired\r\nmyself out. I saved till I bought a little piece of land for myself.\r\nThen I married and raised the family. Me and my wife and the children\r\nfarmed that place up to ten years ago and then she died. My son farms\r\nthe place now and I came to Beaumont. I live with my girl.\r\n\r\n\"I remember me in time of war we danced. Round dances. We sang and\r\ndanced La Boulangere in time of war. De song go:\r\n\r\n\"'La Boulangere ait ta victoire\r\nEt nous, qui sont en guerre,\r\nVoici le jour que je dois partir.\r\n\r\n\"'Mon cher ami, tu pars,\r\nTu me laisses un enfant dans les bras\r\n   et prend tes armes.\r\nEt moi, je vais dans le moment\r\n   verser des larmes.\r\n\r\n\"'Quand je serai en le guerre, [Handwritten Note: à la guerre?]\r\nTu serais de garnison,\r\nEt tu m'oublirais moi,\r\nQui serai en les haillons.\r\n\r\n\"'J'entends le tombour qui m'appelle\r\n   A les points de jour.\r\nMon cher Armande, si tu m'aimes\r\nTu penserais à moi, quand tu serais,\r\n   Dans tes plaisir.\r\nMoi--que serai au bout du fusil!'\r\n\r\n\"I got one real scare. I was with M'sieur Arceneaux in Lafayette. There\r\nwas the battle. Lots of fighting. Lots of killing. The Yankees came\r\nright inside the house. I stayed hid.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know whether it's been better since the war. At all times one\r\nhas his miseries. We managed to get along on the farm. But now I have\r\nnothing. Oh, I don't mean slavery was better than to be free. I mean\r\ntimes were better.\r\n\r\n\"The reason I'm so light is, my mama was half-white. My papa was Neville\r\nBroussard and he was all white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420233\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fannie Brown]\r\n\r\n\r\n     FANNIE BROWN, aged Negro of Waco, Texas, does not know her age.

Fred was eight years old\r\n     when the Civil War started. During the War, he and a number of\r\n     other slaves were taken to Kaufman Co., Texas, as refugees, by\r\n     Henry Bidder, an overseer.

Dat am bad figgers, I\r\nnever has any truck with sich numbers as de 7 or de 13.\r\n\r\n\"Massa have quite pert a plantation in Louisiana, dis side de\r\nMississippi River. De slaves him own am from 40 to 50 sometimes. In our\r\nfamily am pappy, mammy and three brudders and one sister, Julia, and six\r\ncousins. Dat am 13 and dat's why massa had so much trouble with niggers\r\nrunnin' 'way!\r\n\r\n\"Everyone have dere certain wo'k and duties for to do. Mammy am de\r\nfamily cook and she he'p at de loom, makin' de cloth. My daddy am de\r\nblacksmith and shoemaker and de tanner. I 'spains how he do tannin.' He\r\nputs de hides in de water with black-oak bark and purty soon de hair\r\ncome off and den he rolls and poun's de hides for to make dem soft.\r\n\r\n\"When I's 'bout 8 years old, or sich, dey starts me to he'pin' in de\r\nyard and as I grows older I he'ps in de fields. Massa, him raises cane\r\nand co'n mostly, no cotton.\r\n\r\n\"De buildings on de place am de resident of de massa and de quarters for\r\nde niggers. Dey am built from logs and de quarters has no floors and no\r\nwindows, jus' square holes whar de windows ought to be. Dey have bunks\r\nfor sleepin' and a table and benches, and cooks in de fireplace.\r\n\r\n\"We allus have plenty for to eat, plenty co'nmeal, 'lasses and heavy,\r\nbrown sugar. We gits flour bread once de week, but lots of butter and\r\nmilk. For de coffee, we roasts meal bran and for de tea, de sassafras.\r\nDen we has veg'tables and fruit dat am raised on de place. De meat\r\nmostly am de wil' game, deer and de turkey, but sometimes hawg meat.\r\n\r\n\"Massa have overseer and overlooker. De overseer am in charge of wo'k\r\nand de overlooker am in charge of de cullud women. De overseer give all\r\nde whippin's. Sometimes when de nigger gits late, 'stead of comin' home\r\nand takin' de whippin' him goes to de caves of de river and stays and\r\njus' comes in night time for food. When dey do dat, de dawgs is put\r\nafter dem and den it am de fight 'tween de nigger and de dawg. Jus' once\r\na nigger kills de dawg with de knife, dat was close to freedom and it\r\ncome 'fore dey ketches him. When dey whips for runnin' off, de nigger am\r\ntied down over a barrel and whipped ha'd, till dey draws blood,\r\nsometimes.\r\n\r\n\"Dem fool niggers what sneak off without de pass, have two things for to\r\nwatch, one is not to be ketched by de overseer and de other am de\r\npatter-rollers. De nigger sho' am skeert of de patters. One time my\r\npappy and my mammy goes out without de pass and de patters takes after\r\ndem. I'se home, 'cause I's too young to be pesterin' roun'. I sees dem\r\ncomin,' and you couldn' catched dem with a jackrabbit. One time anoudder\r\nnigger am runnin' from de patters and hides under de house. Dey fin' him\r\nand make him come out. You's seen de dawg quaver when him's col'? Well,\r\ndat nigger have de quaverment jus' like dat. De patters hits him five or\r\nsix licks and lets him go. Dat nigger have lots of power--him gits to de\r\nquarters ahead of his shadow.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I tell 'bout some good times. We is 'lowed to have parties and de\r\ndance and we has for music, sich as de banjo and de jew's harp and a\r\n'cordian. Dey dance de promenade and de jeg. Sometimes day\r\nhave de jiggin' contest and two niggers puts a glass of water on dere\r\nheads and den see who can dance de longes' without spillin' any water.\r\nDen we has log-rollin'. Dere was two teams, 'bout three to de team, and\r\ndey see which can roll de log de fastes'. Den sometimes a couple am\r\n'lowed to git married and dere am extry fixed for supper. De couple\r\nsteps over de broom laid en de floor, dey's married den.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes de overlooker don' let dem git married. I 'splains it dis\r\nway. He am used for to father de chillun. Him picks de portly, and de\r\nhealthy women dat am to rear de portly chillen. De overlooker, he am\r\nportly man. Dem dat him picks he overlooks, and not 'low dem to marry or\r\nto go round with other nigger men. If dey do, its whippin' sho.' De\r\nmassa raises some fine, portly chillen, and dey sel' some, after dey's\r\nhalf-grown, for $500 and sometimes more.\r\n\r\n\"De war didn' make no diff'runce, dat I notices, 'cept massa and one\r\noverseer jines de army. Massa come back, but de overseer am captured by\r\nde Yankees, so massa says, and we never hears 'bout him after dat. De\r\nsoldiers passes by lots of times, both de 'federates and de 'blue\r\nbellies', but we's never bothered with dem. De fightin' was not close\r\nenough to make trouble. Jus' 'fore freedom come, de new overseer am\r\n'structed to take us to Texas and takes us to Kaufman County and we is\r\nrefugees dere. De Yankee mans tells us we am free and can do sich as we\r\npleases. Dat lef' us in charge of no one and we'uns, jus' like cattle,\r\nwen' wanderin'.\r\n\r\n\"Pappy, him goes back to Lousiana to massa's place. Dat am de las' we\r\nhears from him.

His picture am in Austin, 'cause I'se down\r\ndere years ago and seen his picture in a case wid Gov'ner Ross' picture.\r\n\r\n\"Anudder thing dat Marster does powe'ful good am trade de niggers. He\r\nbuys and sells 'em all de time. You see, dere was traders dat traveled\r\nfrom place to place dem days and dey takes sometimes as much as 100\r\nniggers for to trade. Dere was sheds outside of town, whar dey keeps de\r\nniggers when dey comes to town.\r\n\r\n\"De Marster and de trader talks dis away: 'How you trade?' 'I'se gives\r\nyou even trade.' 'No, I'se wants $25.00 for de diff'runce.' 'I'se gives\r\nyou $5.00.' Dat's de way dey talks on and on. Maybe dey makes de trade\r\nand maybe dey don'.\r\n\r\n\"Dey have auction sometime and Marster allus tend 'em. At de auction\r\nI'se seen dem sell a family. Maybe one man buy de mammy, anudder buy de\r\npappy and anudder buy all de chillens or maybe jus' one, like dat. I'se\r\nsee dem cry like dey at de funeral when dey am parted. Dey has to drag\r\n'em away.\r\n\r\n\"When de auction begin, he says: 'Dis nigger is so and so ole, he never\r\n'bused, he soun' as a dollar. Jus' look at de muscle and de big\r\nshoulders. He's worth a thousan' of any man's money. How much am I\r\noffered?' Den de biddin' starts. It goes like dis: '$200 I'se hear, does\r\nI'se hear $250, does I hear $300.' Den de nigger takes hims clothes--dey\r\nhave one extry suit--and goes wid de man dat buys him.\r\n\r\n\"De day befo' Marster gives we'uns freedom, he says to we'uns, 'I'se\r\nwants all you niggers to come to de front of de house Sunday mornin!'\r\nWe'uns was dere and he was standin' on de gallery, holdin' a paper in\r\nhims han' and readin'. Dere was tears in hims eyes and some drap on de\r\npaper. I'se have tears in my eyes, too; mos' of 'em have. When hims done\r\nreadin', hims says: 'You darkies is as free as I'se is. You can go or\r\nyou can stay. Those dat stay till de crops laid by, I'se will give $5.00\r\na month.'\r\n\r\n\"Den he takes de little niggers and says, 'De little fellows who I'se\r\nhave sold dere mammies will stay wid me till dey am 21 years ole. You\r\nlittle fellows, I'se know you's age and I'se give yous de statement.'\r\n\r\n\"Mos' of de niggers stays wid him, but dey lef' fust one and den tudder.\r\nI'se stays on wid him for many years and works as coachman. When I lef'\r\nde Marster, 'twas to work for a farmer for one year, den I'se comes to\r\nFort Worth. I'se works in lumberya'd for long time.\r\n\r\n\"For de las' 12 years I'se been blin'. I'se had hard time after dat till\r\nde las' year but I'se gits de pension each month, dat am a heap of help.\r\nDis nigger am thankful for what de Lawd have blessed me wid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420104\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Josie Brown]\r\n\r\n\r\n     JOSIE BROWN was born about 1859, in Victoria, Texas.

I never seed any of dem since I ran 'way from\r\nthere, when I's ten years old.\r\n\r\n\"I sometimes wishes I's back on de plantation. I's took good care of\r\ndere and massa am awful good. Each fam'ly have dere own cabin and it\r\nwarn't so much for niceness but we lives comfor'ble and has plenty to\r\neat and wear. My mammy work de loom, makin' cloth, and us chillen wears\r\nlinsey cloth shirts till dey gives us pants. Massa buy he fam'ly nice\r\nclothes but dey wears linsey clothes everyday. Same with shoes, dey am\r\nmade on de plantation and de first store shoes I has am after surrender.\r\nMy mammy buys me a pair with brass tips on de toe, and am I dress up\r\nden!\r\n\r\n\"De food am bester dan what I's had since dem days. Dey raises it all\r\nbut de salt and sich. You wouldn't 'lieve how us et den. It am ham and\r\nbacon, 'cause dey raises all de hawgs. It am cornmeal and some white\r\nflour and fruit and honey and 'lasses and brown sugar. De 'lasses am\r\nblack as I is and dat am some black. I wishes I was dere and mammy call\r\nme, and I can smell dat ham fryin' right now.\r\n\r\n\"Not once does I know of de massa whippin' and him don't talk rough\r\neven. Jus' so de work am done we does as we pleases, long as us\r\nreas'ble. Us have parties and dancin' and singin'. De music am de banjo\r\nand de fiddle.\r\n\r\n\"I don't 'member when de war start but I 'member when it stop and massa\r\ncall all us together and tell us we's no more slaves. Him talk lots\r\n'bout what it mean and how it am diff'rent and we'uns have to make our\r\nown way and can't 'pend on him like.

Pappy keep de farm and mammy teach school.\r\nHer missie done larnt her to read and sich from time she a young'un, so\r\nshe have eddication so good dey puts her to teachin'.\r\n\r\n\"De way I leaves home am dis. One day mammy teachin' school and me and\r\nmy sister am home, and I 'cides she need de haircut. She want it, too.\r\nSo I gits de shears and goes to work and after I works a while de job\r\ndon't look so good, so I cuts some more and den it look worse and I\r\ntries to fix it and first thing I knows dere ain't no hair left to cut.\r\nWhen mammy come home she pays me for de work with de rawhide whip and\r\ndat hurts my feelin's so bad I 'cides to git even by runnin' 'way a few\r\ndays. It am 'bout sundown and I starts to go and comes to Massa Sam\r\nBragg's place. I's tired den and not so strong 'bout de idea and 'cides\r\nto rest. I walks into he yard and dere am a covered wagon standin' and\r\nloaded with lots of stuff and de front end open. I finds de soft place\r\nin de back and goes to sleep, and when I wakes up it am jus' gittin'\r\ndaylight and dat wagon am a-movin'.'\r\n\r\n\"I don't say nothin'. I's skeert and waits for dat wagon to stop, so's I\r\ncan crawl out. I jus' sits and sits and when it stop I crawls out and\r\nMassa Bragg say, 'Good gosh, look what am crawlin' out de wagon! He look\r\nat me a while and den he say, 'You's too far from home for me to take\r\nyou back and you'll git lost if you tries to walk home. I guesses I'll\r\nhave to take you with me.' I thinks him am goin' some place and comin'\r\nback, but it am to Texas him come and stop at Birdville. Dat am how dis\r\nnigger come to Texas.\r\n\r\n\"I's often wish my mammy done whip me so hard I couldn't walk off de\r\nplace, 'cause from den on I has mighty hard times. I stays with Massa\r\nBragg four years and then I hunts for a job where I can git some wages.\r\nI gits it with Massa Joe Henderson, workin' on he farm and I's been\r\nround these parts ever since and farmed most my life.\r\n\r\n\"I gits into a picklement once years ago. I's 'rested on de street. I's\r\nnot done a thing, jus' walkin' 'long de street with 'nother fellow and\r\ndey claim he stole somethin'. I didn't know nothin' 'bout since. Did dey\r\nturn me a-loose? Dey turn me loose after six months on de chain gang. I\r\nworks on de road three months with a ball and chain on de legs. After\r\ndat trouble, I sho' picks my comp'ny.\r\n\r\n\"I marries onct, 'bout forty years ago, and after four years she drops\r\ndead with de heart mis'ry. Us have no chillen so I's alone in de world.\r\nIt am all right long as I could work, but five years ago dis right arm\r\ngits to shakin' so bad I can' work no more. For a year now dey pays me\r\n$9.00 pension. It am hard to live on dat for a whole month, but I's glad\r\nto git it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4210129\r\n\r\n\r\n     MADISON BRUIN, 92, spent his early days as a slave on the Curtis\r\n     farm in the blue grass region of Kentucky, where he had some\r\n     experience with some of the fine horses for which the state is\r\n     famous. Here, too, he had certain contacts with soldiers of John\r\n     Morgan, of Confederate fame. His eyes are keen and his voice mellow\r\n     and low. His years have not taken a heavy toll of his vitality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I's a old Kentucky man. I's born in Fayette County, 'bout five miles\r\nfrom Lexington, right where dere lots of fine hosses. My old massa was\r\nname Jack Curtis and de old missus was Miss Addie. My mother name Mary\r\nand she die in 1863 and never did see freedom. I don't 'member my daddy\r\na-tall.\r\n\r\n\"De place was jis' a farm, 'cause dey didn't know nothin' 'bout\r\nplantations up dere in Kentucky. Dey raise corn and wheat and garlic and\r\nfast hosses. Dey used to have big hoss races and dey had big tracks and\r\nI's stood in de middle of dat big track in Lexington and watch dem\r\nex'cise de hosses. Sometimes I got to help dem groom some dem grand\r\nhosses and dat was de big day for me. I don't 'member dem hosses names,\r\nno, suh, but I knowed one big bay hoss what won de race nearly every\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"I had two sisters name Jeanette and Fanny and a brother, Henry, and\r\nafter my daddy die, my mother marries a man name Paris and I had one\r\nhalf-brother call Alfred Paris.\r\n\r\n\"Old massa was good to us and give us plenty food. He never beat us\r\nhard. He had a son what jis' one month older'n me and we run 'round and\r\nplay lots. Old massa, he whip me and he own son jis' de same when we\r\nbad. He didn't whip us no more'n he ought to, though. Dey was good\r\nmassas and some mean ones, and some worthless cullud folks, too.\r\n\r\n\"Durin' de war de cholera broke out 'mongst de people and everybody\r\nscairt dey gwine cotch it. Dey say it start with de hurtin' in de\r\nstomach and every time us hurt in de stomach, missus make us come quick\r\nto de big house. Dat suit us jis' right and when dey sends Will and me\r\nto hoe or do somethin' us didn't want to do, pretty soon I say, 'Willie,\r\nI think my stomach 'ginnin to hurt. I think dis mis'ry a sign I gittin'\r\nde cholera.' Den him say, 'Us better go to de big house like ma say,'\r\nand with dat, us quit workin'. Us git out lots of work dat way, but us\r\nain't ever took de cholera yit.\r\n\r\n\"Durin' de war John Morgan's men come and took all de hosses. Dey left\r\ntwo and Willie and me took dem to hide in de plum thicket, but us jis'\r\ngit out de gate when de sojers come 'gain and dey head us off and take\r\nde last two hosses.\r\n\r\n\"My mother she wore de Yankee flag under her dress like a petticoat when\r\nde 'federates come raidin'. Other times she wore it top de dress. When\r\ndey hears de 'federates comin' de white folks makes us bury all de gold\r\nand de silver spoons out in de garden. Old massa, he in de Yankee army,\r\n'cause dey 'script him, but he sons, John and Joe, dey volunteers.\r\n\r\n\"Old massa he never sold none of he slaves. I used to hear him and\r\nmissus fussin' 'bout de niggers, 'cause some 'long to her and some to\r\nhim and dey have de time keepin' dem straighten' out.\r\n\r\nUs boys have good time playin'. Us draw de line and some git on one side\r\nand some de other. Den one sing out\r\n\r\n\"'Chickama, Chickama, craney crow,\r\n  Went to de well to wash my toe;\r\n  When I git back my chicken was gone,\r\n      What time, old witch?'\r\n\r\n\"Den somebody holler out, 'One o'clock' or 'Two o'clock' or any time,\r\nand dem on one side try to cotch dem on de other side.\r\n\r\n\"When I's young I didn't mind plowin', but I didn't like to ride at\r\nfust, but dey make me larn anyhow. Course, dat white boy and me, us like\r\nmost anything what not too much work. Us go down to de watermelon patch\r\nand plug dem melons, den us run hide in de woods and eat watermelon.\r\nCourse, dey lots of time dey 'low us to play jis' by ourselves. Us play\r\none game where us choose sides and den sing:\r\n\r\n\"'Can, can, candio,\r\n  Old man Dandio,\r\n  How many men you got?\r\n  More'n you're able to cotch.'\r\n\r\n\"Endurin' de war us git whip many a time for playin' with shells what us\r\nfind in de woods. Us heered de cannons shootin' in Lexington and lots of\r\ndem shells drap in de woods.\r\n\r\n\"What did I think when I seed all dem sojers? I wants to be one, too. I\r\ndidn't care what side, I jis' wants a gun and a hoss and be a sojer.\r\nJohn Morgan, he used to own de hemp factory in Lexington. When young\r\nmassa jine Woolford's 11th Kentucky Cavalry, dey come to de place and\r\nhalt befo' de big house in de turnpike. Dey have shotguns and blind\r\nbridles on dere hosses, not open bridle like on de race hosses. Dey jis'\r\nin reg'lar clothes but next time dey come through dey in blue uniforms.\r\nAll my white folks come back from de war and didn't git kilt. Nobody\r\never telt me I's free. I's happy dere and never left dem till 1872. All\r\nde others gone befo' dat, but I gits all I wants and I didn't need no\r\nmoney. I didn't know what paper money was and one time massa's son give\r\nme a paper dime to git some squab and I didn't know what money was and I\r\nburned it up.\r\n\r\n\"Dey's jis' one thing I like to do most and dat's eat. Dey allus had\r\nplenty of everything and dey had a big, wooden tray, or trough and dey\r\nput potlicker and cornbread in dat trough and set it under de big locust\r\ntree and all us li'l niggers jis' set 'round and eat and eat. Jis' eat\r\nall us wants. Den when us git full us fall over and go to sleep. Us jis'\r\ngit fat and lazy. When us see dat bowl comin', dat bowl call us jis'\r\nlike hawgs runnin' to de trough.\r\n\r\n\"Dey was great on gingerbread and us go for dat. Dey couldn't leave it\r\nin de kitchen or de pantry so old missus git a big tin box and hide de\r\ngingerbread under her bed and kept de switch on us to keep us 'way from\r\nit. But sometime us sneak up in de bedroom and git some, even den.\r\n\r\n\"When I 'bout 17 I left Kentucky and goes to Indiana and white folks\r\nsends me to school to larn readin' and writin', but I got tired of dat\r\nand run off and jine de army. Dat in 1876 and dey sends me to Arizona.\r\nAfter dat I's at Fort Sill in what used to be Indian Territory and den\r\nat Fort Clark and Fort Davis, dat in Garfield's 'ministration, den in\r\nFort Quitman on de Rio Grande. I's in skirmishes with de Indians on\r\nDevil's River and in de Brazos Canyon, and in de Rattlesnake Range and\r\nin de Guadalupe Mountains. De troops was de Eighth Cavalry and de Tenth\r\nInfantry. De white and de cullud folks was altogether and I have three\r\nhosses in de cavalry. De fust one plays out, de next one shot down on\r\ncampaign and one was condemn. On dat campaign us have de White Mountain\r\n'paches with us for scouts.\r\n\r\n\"When I git discharge' from de Army I come to Texas and work on de S.P.\r\nRailroad and I been in Texas ever since, and when I's in Dallas I got\r\n'flicted and got de pension 'cause I been in de army. I ain't done much\r\nwork in ten year.\r\n\r\n\"I gits married in San Antonio on December 14, 1882 and I marries Dolly\r\nGross and dat her right dere. Us have de nice weddin', plenty to eat and\r\ndrink. Us have only one chile, a gal, and she dead, but us 'dopt sev'ral\r\nchillen.\r\n\r\n\"Us come to Beaumont in 1903 and I works 'round Spindletop and I works\r\nfor de gas people and de waterworks people. I's been a carpenter and\r\ndone lots of common work wherever I could find it.\r\n\r\n\"It's been long time since slavery and I's old, but me and my old lady's\r\nin good health and us manage to git 'long fairly well. Dat's 'bout all I\r\ncan 'member 'bout de old times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420236\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Martha Spence Bunton]\r\n\r\n\r\n     MARTHA SPENCE BUNTON, 81, was born a slave, Jan. 1, 1856, on the\r\n     John Bell plantation, in Murphfreesboro, Tennessee. Mr. Bell sold\r\n     Martha, her mother and four sisters to Joseph Spence, who brought\r\n     them to Texas. Martha married Andy Bunton in 1880, and they had\r\n     nine children. Martha now lives with her sister, Susan, on twelve\r\n     acres of land which their father bought for $25.00 an acre. The\r\n     farm is picturesquely located on a thickly wooded hill about six\r\n     miles east of Austin, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was born on New Year's Day. Yes, suh, in 1856, on Massa Bell's\r\nplantation over in Tennessee. De name of de town was Murphreesboro, and\r\nmy mammy and my four sisters and me all 'longed to Massa John Bell, but\r\nhe done sold us to Massa Joseph Spence, and dat how I come by my name.\r\n\r\n\"I 'members how Massa Spence brung us to Texas in wagons, and the way we\r\nknowed when we hit Texas am 'cause massa 'gin to talk 'bout a norther.\r\nWhen dat norther done strike, all de weeds and leaves jus' starts\r\nrollin'. Us poor, ig'rant niggers thunk at first dey was rabbits, 'cause\r\nwe'd never seed a rabbit den. Massa Spence rid his hoss and Missie\r\nSpence come 'long in de richer way, in a coach. De chillen walked\r\nmornin's and de older folks walked afternoons.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Spence come to Montopolis, right nigh to Austin, and settled\r\ndown. I helped carry dinner pails to de field workers, and dey was full\r\nof meat and cabbage and biscuit. Pappy wasn't dere then, 'cause he was\r\nown by Massa Burrows, over in Tennessee. But when his massa died, my\r\nmassa bought pappy and he come out to Texas. Befo' I's a sizeable child,\r\nmammy took sick with diphtheria and died and pappy had to be mammy and\r\npappy to us. Pappy was a big-bodied man and on Sunday mornin' he'd git\r\nout of bed and make a big fire and say, 'Jiminy cripes! You chillen stay\r\nin you beds and I'll make de biscuits.' He would, too. I laughs when I\r\nthinks 'bout dem big, rye biscuits, what was so big we called dem\r\n'Nigger heels.' Dey sho' was big biscuits, but dey was good. We never\r\ndid git no butter, though, and sometimes we'd ask the white chillen to\r\ngive us a piece of biscuit with butter on it. We got plenty other\r\neats--sliced meat and roastin' ears and sweet milk.\r\n\r\n\"After freedom pappy sent us to school to de white teacher, and dat's\r\nwhy I can read and write. I went to de sixth grade and quit. Pappy was\r\ndrinkin' a lot then. He'd take alcohol and mix it with 'lasses and\r\nwater. But he was good to us. Sometimes a Texas norther come up and we'd\r\nbe on the way home and we'd see something comin' what look like a\r\nelephant and it was pappy, with a bundle of coats.\r\n\r\n\"I was twenty-four years old when I married Andy Bunton and he jes'\r\nrented farms here and yonder. We had a big weddin' and pork and turkey\r\nand cake. Aunt Lucy Hubbard, what weighed three hundred pounds, done de\r\ncookin' dat day. We had such a good time nobody knowed when one de\r\nguests stole a whole turkey.\r\n\r\n\"I was mother of nine chillen and three of dem is livin' now. Andy made\r\na purty good livin till he had a paral'sis stroke. Poor old feller! In\r\nde end, I took care of him and had to work like I was young again.

Ellen is about 78 years old. She\r\n     now lives in Beaumont, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My old massa was name Richmond Butler and he used to have a big\r\nplantation over on Whiska Chitto, in Louisiana, and that's where I was\r\nborn. They used to call the place Bagdad. I was his slave till I six\r\nyear old and then freedom come.\r\n\r\n\"I don't 'member my daddy, but my mammy was name Dicey Ann Butler. I\r\nhave seven sister and three brudder, and they was Anderson and Charlie\r\nand Willie, and the girls was Laura and Rosa and Rachel and Fannie and\r\nAdeline and Sottie and Nora.\r\n\r\n\"Us used to live in a li'l log house with one room. The floor was dirt\r\nand the house was make jus' like they used to make 'tater house. They\r\nwas a little window in the back. When I was a baby they wrop me up in\r\ncotton and put me in a coffee pot--that how li'l I was. But I grows to\r\nbe more sizable.\r\n\r\n\"The plantation were a good, big place and they have 'bout 200 head of\r\nniggers. When I gets big enough they start me to totin' water to the\r\nfield. I gits the water out the spring and totes it in gourds. They cut\r\nthe gourds so that a strip was left round and cross the top and that the\r\nhandle. They was about a foot 'cross and a foot deep. Us used to have\r\none good gourd us kep' lard in and li'l gourds to drink out of.\r\n\r\n\"Massa never 'lowed us slaves go to church but they have big holes in\r\nthe fields they gits down in and prays. They done that way 'cause the\r\nwhite folks didn't want them to pray. They used to pray for freedom.\r\n\r\n\"When the white folks go off they writes on the meal and flour with they\r\nfingers. That the way they know if us steal meal. Sometime they take a\r\nstick and write in front of the door so if anybody go out they step on\r\nthat writin' and the massa know. That the way us larn how to write.\r\n\r\n\"Old massa didn't give 'em much to eat. When they comes in out of the\r\nfield they goes work for other folks for something to eat.\r\n\r\n\"They jus' have a old frame with planks to sleep on and no mattress or\r\nnothin'. In winter they have to keep the fire goin' all night to keep\r\nfrom freezin'. They put a old quilt down on the floor for the li'l\r\nfolks. They have a li'l trough us used to eat out of with a li'l wooden\r\npaddle. Us didn't know nothin' 'bout knives and forks.\r\n\r\n\"I never did git nothin' much to eat. My sister she de cook and sometime\r\nwhen the white folks gone us go up to the big house and she give us\r\nsomethin'. But she make us wash the mouth after us finish eatin', so\r\nthey won't be no crumbs in our mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Massa used to beat 'em all the time. My brudder tell old massa sometime\r\nhe git hongry and gwine have to come ask de niggers for somethin' to\r\neat. He say he never do that, but he did, 'cause after freedom he go to\r\nWest Texas and some niggers with him and he los' everything and, sho'\r\n'nough, old massa have to go to my brudder and ask him for food and a\r\nshelter to sleep under. Then he say if he had it to do over, he\r\nwouldn't treat the hands so bad.\r\n\r\n\"One time my brudder slip off de plantation and they almost beat him to\r\ndeath. He told 'em he had to do somethin' to git somethin' to eat. They\r\nused to put 'em 'cross a log or barrel to beat 'em. My mammy had a strop\r\n'bout eight inch wide they used to beat 'em with.\r\n\r\n\"Most clothes what we git is from the Iles, what was rich folks and\r\nlives close by. They folks lives in DeRidder, in Louisiana, I hears.\r\nThey treated the slaves like white folks.\r\n\r\n\"On Christmas time they give us a meal. I 'member that. I don't 'member\r\nno other holidays.\r\n\r\n\"When us git sick us go to the woods and git herbs and roots and make\r\ntea and medicine. We used to git Blackhaw root and cherry bark and\r\ndogwood and chinquapin bark, what make good tonic. Black snakeroot and\r\nswamproot make good medicine, too.\r\n\r\n\"My mammy told us we was free and we starts right off and walks to\r\nSugartown, 'bout 8 mile away. I 'member my brudder wades 'cross a pool\r\ntotin' me.\r\n\r\n\"I used to nuss Dr. Frasier. He used to be the high sheriff in\r\nDeRidder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420182\r\n\r\n\r\n     HENRY H. BUTTLER, 87, venerable graduate of Washburn College,\r\n     Topeka, Kansas, and ex-school teacher, was born a slave to Mr.\r\n     George Sullivan on his 300 acre plantation in Farquier Co.,\r\n     Virginia. Henry and a number of other slaves were transported to\r\n     Arkansas in 1863, and Henry escaped and joined the Union Army. He\r\n     now lives at 1308 E. Bessie St., Fort Worth, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My name is Henry H. Buttler and I am past 87 years of age. That figure\r\nmay not be accurate, but you must realize that there were no authentic\r\nrecords made of slave births. I estimate my age on the work I was doing\r\nat the commencement of the Civil War and the fact that I was large\r\nenough to be accepted as a soldier in the Union Army, in the year of\r\n1864.\r\n\r\n\"I was born on the plantation of George Sullivan, in Farquier Co.,\r\nVirginia. The plantation was situated in the valley at the base of Bull\r\nMountain, and presented a beautiful picture. The plantation consisted of\r\nabout 30 acres, with about 30 slaves, though this number varied and\r\nsometimes reached 50. Mr. Sullivan owned my mother and her children, but\r\nmy father was owned by Mr. John Rector, whose place was adjacent to\r\nours.\r\n\r\n\"The slave quarters consisted of a group of one-room log cabins, with no\r\nflooring, and very crude furnishings. There were bunks and benches and a\r\ntable and the fireplace provided the means for cooking and heating.\r\n\r\n\"The food was wholesome and of sufficient quantity. In that period about\r\nall the food was produced and processed on the plantation, which\r\neliminated any reason for failure to provide ample food. The meat was\r\nhome cured and the ham and bacon had a superior flavor.\r\n\r\n\"On the Sullivan place there existed consideration for human feelings\r\nbut on the Rector place neither the master nor the overseer seemed to\r\nunderstand that slaves were human beings. One old slave called Jim, on\r\nthe Rector place, disobeyed some rule and early one morning they ordered\r\nhim to strip. They tied him to the whipping post and from morning until\r\nnoon, at intervals, the lash was applied to his back. I, myself, saw and\r\nheard many of the lashes and his cries for mercy.\r\n\r\n\"One morning a number of slaves were ordered to lay a fence row on the\r\nRector place. The overseer said, 'This row must be laid to the Branch\r\nand left in time to roll those logs out in the back woods.' It was\r\nsundown when we laid the last rail but the overseer put us to rolling\r\nlogs without any supper and it was eleven when we completed the task.\r\nOld Pete, the ox driver, became so exhausted that he fell asleep without\r\nunyoking the oxen. For that, he was given 100 lashes.\r\n\r\n\"The slaves were allowed to marry but were compelled to first obtain\r\npermission from the master. The main factor involved in securing the\r\nmaster's consent was his desire to rear negroes with perfect physiques.\r\nOn neither plantation was there any thought or compassion when a sale or\r\ntrade was in question. I have seen the separation of husband and wife,\r\nchild and mother, and the extreme grief of those involved, and the lash\r\nadministered to a grieving slave for neglecting their work. All this\r\nmade the marriages a farce.\r\n\r\n\"In 1863 Mr. Sullivan transported about 40 of us slaves to Arkansas,\r\nlocating us on a farm near Pine Bluff, so we would not be taken by the\r\nFederal soldiers. The general faithfulness of the slave was noticeable\r\nthen, as they had a chance to desert and go to free states. But I think\r\nI was the only one who deserted Mr. Sullivan. I went to Federal\r\nHeadquarters at Fort Smith, Arkansas, and was received into the army. We\r\ncampaigned in Arkansas and nearby territory. The major battle I fought\r\nin was that of Pine Bluff, which lasted one day and part of one night.\r\n\r\n\"After I was mustered out of the army, I set out to get an education and\r\nentered a grade school at Pine Bluff. I worked after school at any job I\r\ncould secure and managed to enter Washburn College, in Topeka, Kansas.\r\nAfter I graduated I followed steam engineering for four years, but later\r\nI went to Fort Worth and spent 22 years in educational work among my\r\npeople. I exerted my best efforts to advance my race.\r\n\r\n\"I married Lucia Brown in 1880 and we had three children, all of whom\r\nare dead. There is just my wife and me left of the family, and we have a\r\n$75.00 per month Union soldier's pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420283\r\n\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM BYRD, 97, was born a slave of Sam Byrd, near Madisonville,\r\n     Texas. William was with his master during the Civil War. The old\r\n     Negro is very feeble, but enjoyed talking about old times. He lives\r\n     in Madisonville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I has a bill of sale what say I's born in 1840, so I knows I's\r\nninety-seven years old, and I's owned by Marse Sam Byrd. My mother's\r\nname was Fannie and I dunno pappy's name, 'cause my mother allus say she\r\nfound me a stray in the woods. I allus 'lieves my master was my pappy,\r\nbut I never did know for sho'.\r\n\r\n\"Our quarters was log and the bed built with poles stuck in the cracks\r\nand cowhide stretched over, and we'd gather moss 'bout once a month and\r\nmake it soft. When it was real cold we'd git close together and I don't\r\ncare how cold it got, we'd sleep jes' as warm as these here feather\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\n\"I split rails and chopped cotton and plowed with a wooden plow and druv\r\nMarse Byrd lots, 'cause he was a trader, slave trade most the time. He\r\nwas good to us and give us lots to eat. He had a big garden and plenty\r\nsugar cane, and brown sugar. We'd press the juice out the cane 'tween\r\ntwo logs and cook it in the big washpot.\r\n\r\n\"We had sheepskin clothes in cold weather, with the fur part inside, no\r\nshoes less'n we wropped our feet in fur hides. But them clothes was\r\nwarmer than these here cotton overalls. They're plumb cold!\r\n\r\nMarse Sam was full of life and Missus Josie was real good. They had a\r\nnice home of that day, made out split logs and four rooms and a hall two\r\nways through it.\r\n\r\n\"That great iron piece hung jes' outside the door and Marse Sam hit it\r\nat 3:30 every mornin'. If we didn't muster out he come round with that\r\ncat-o-nine-tails and let us have it, and we knowed what that bell was\r\nfor nex' mornin'. Sometimes when Marse Sam was gone, we'd have a\r\noverseer. He'd let us go swimmin' in the creek when the work was done.\r\n\r\n\"If a nigger was mean Marse Sam give him fifty licks over a log the\r\nfirst time and seventy-five licks the second time and 'bout that time he\r\nmost gen'rally had a good nigger. If they was real mean and he couldn't\r\ndo nothin' with 'em, he put them in the jail with a chain on the feets\r\nfor three days, and fed 'em through a crack in the wall.\r\n\r\n\"On Christmas Marse Sam had a great big eggnog and kilt a big beef and\r\nhad fireworks, and the nigger, he know Christmas was come. We had plenty\r\nto eat and eggnog and did 'bout what we pleased that day and New Year's.\r\nThe white folks allus said what we'd do on them days we'd do all year.\r\nThat's all foolishment, but some still believes in it.\r\n\r\n\"They give a big dance and all night supper when war started. Then Marse\r\nSam, he carries me for waterboy and cook and to tend his hosses. He had\r\ntwo, and rid one this day and the other nex' day. He was 'fraid one git\r\nkilt and then he wouldn't be slam a-foot.\r\n\r\n\"When them big guns went to poppin', I jes' couldn't stand it without\r\ngittin' in a brush top. Then marse goes and gits shot and I has to be\r\nhis nuss. But, Lawd-a-me, one them Yankee gals, she falls in love with\r\nmarse whilst he lays nearly dead, and she say, 'William, he's mine, so\r\nyou got to take good care of him.' And him with a plumb good wife back\r\nhome!\r\n\r\n\"When Marse Sam git well, he say he's goin' to 'nother place to fight.\r\nHe was with General Lee when that old war was over and that there Yankee\r\nGeneral Grant takes General Lee prisoner, and Marse Sam won't leave his\r\ngeneral, and he say to me, 'William, you got to go home alone.'\r\n\r\n\"I lights out a-foot to Texas and it's most a year befo' I gits home. I\r\ntravels day and night at first. I buys some things to eat but every time\r\nI goes by a farmhouse I steals a chicken. Sometimes I sho' gits hongry.\r\nWhen I git to the house, Missus Josie faints, 'cause she thunk Marse Sam\r\nain't with me and he mus' be dead. I tells her he's in prison and she\r\nsay she'll give me $2.00 a month to stay till he gits back. I's plumb\r\ncrazy 'bout a little gal called 'Cricket,' 'cause she so pert and full\r\nof live, so I stays. We gits us a cabin and that's all to our weddin'.\r\nWe stays a year befo' Marse Sam comes back.\r\n\r\n\"He was the plumb awfulest sight you ever done seed! His clothes is tore\r\noffen his body and he ain't shaved in three months and he's mos' starved\r\nto death. Missus Josie she don't even rec'nize him and wouldn't 'low him\r\nin till I tells her dat am Marse Sam, all right. He stays sick a whole\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\"I thinks if them Yankees didn't 'tend to fix some way for us pore\r\nniggers, dey oughtn't turn us a-loose. Iffen de white folks in de South\r\nhadn't been jes' what they is, us niggers been lots worser off than we\r\nwas. In slavery time when the nigger am sick, his master pay de bills,\r\nbut when nigger sick now, that's his own lookout.\r\n\r\n\"I never done nothin' but farm and odd jobs. I been married five times,\r\nbut only my las' wife am livin' now. My four boys and two gals is all\r\nfarmin' right here in the county and they helps us out. We gits by\r\nsomehow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420277\r\n\r\n\r\n     LOUIS CAIN, 88, was born in North Carolina, a slave of Samuel Cain.\r\n     After Louis was freed, he came to Texas, and has farmed near\r\n     Madisonville over sixty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I knows I's birthed in 1849, 'cause I had a bill of sale. It say that.\r\nMy master traded me to Massa Joe Cutt for a hundred acres of land.\r\nThat's in 1861, and I 'members it well. My daddy was Sam Cain, name\r\nafter old Massa Cain, and mammy was Josie Jones, 'cause she owned by\r\n'nother master. Mammy was birthed in North Carolina, but daddy allus say\r\nhe come from Africy. He say they didn't work hard over there, 'cause all\r\nthey et come out the jungle, and they had all the wives they wanted.\r\nThat was the 'ligion over there.\r\n\r\n\"Our quarters was made of logs, in a long shed six rooms long, like\r\ncowsheds or chicken houses, and one door to each room. The bed was a\r\nhole dug in a corner and poles around and shucks and straw. We'd sleep\r\nwarm all night long, but it wouldn't do in this country in summertime.\r\n\r\n\"Massa give us plenty to eat. Our cornbread was what you calls water\r\npone bread and cooked in the ashes. We didn't have no stove. Massa was a\r\ngreat hunter and allus had venison and game. They was plenty fish, too.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Cain was purty good to his slaves and mean to them if they didn't\r\nbehave. Missy was a good woman. They lived in a two-story rock house\r\nwith plenty trees all 'round.\r\n\r\n\"We worked long as we could see, from four o'clock in the mornin', and\r\nthem milked twenty cows and fed the work stock. They was fifty acres and\r\nnot 'nough niggers to work it easy.\r\n\r\n\"If some niggers was mean they'd git it. Massa tied they hands to they\r\nfeet and tied them to a tree and hit 'bout twenty-five or fifty licks\r\nwith a rawhide belt. Hide and blood flew then. Next mornin' he'd turn\r\nthem loose and they'd have to work all day without nothin' to eat. He\r\nhad a cabin called jail for the nigger women, and chain them in with\r\ncornbread and one glass of water.\r\n\r\n\"One nigger run to the woods to be a jungle nigger, but massa cotched\r\nhim with the dogs and took a hot iron and brands him. Then he put a bell\r\non him, in a wooden frame what slip over the shoulders and under the\r\narms. He made that nigger wear the bell a year and took it off on\r\nChristmas for a present to him. It sho' did make a good nigger out of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"In the summer time they had camp meetin' and baptized in the creek,\r\nwhite folks first while the old nigger mammies shouts, and then the\r\nniggers.\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday mornin' us men grated corn for bread the next week and the\r\nwomen washed massa's clothes and our'n. On Saturday night we'd have a\r\ndance all night long, and Sunday the men went to see they wives or\r\nsweethearts and us young'uns went swimmin' in the creek. Every night but\r\nSaturday we had to go to bed at nine o'clock. Massa hit the big steel\r\npiece and we knowed it was time to put out the torches and pile in.\r\n\r\n\"On Christmas I'd stand by the gate, to open it for the company, and\r\nthey'd throw nuts and candy to me. That night all the slaves what could\r\nbrung they banjoes and fiddles and played for the white folks to dance\r\nall night. Them great old days are done gone. Most the men be full that\r\ngood, old eggnog.\r\n\r\n\"After war come they ain't no more dances and fun, and not much to eat\r\nor nothin'. Massa git kilt in a big battle and missy took four slaves\r\nand brung him home and buried him under a big shade tree in the yard.\r\nThat the saddes' time I ever seen, nobody there to do anythin' but missy\r\nand neighbor women and some real young niggers like me. She was cryin'\r\nand all us slaves takin' on. It's a wonder we ever did git massa buried.\r\nWe carried him on our backs to the grave.\r\n\r\n\"After that we had to carry missy to the mountains and hide her, 'cause\r\neverything, house and sheds and all, was burnt, and all her stock kilt\r\nby sojers and outlaws. When she come out of hidin' she didn't have a\r\nthing, not even a bed.\r\n\r\n\"But she was a brave woman, and said, 'Louis, we'll fix some kind of\r\nquarters for you.' She went to work to rebuild the place. She said, 'You\r\nniggers is free, but I need you and I'll pay you $2.00 a month.' She\r\ndid, too. She cut some logs and builded her one room and then we all\r\nbuild us a room and that was the best we could do. I 'lieve the Lawd\r\nblessed that woman. After freedom, that's how I lived the first year,\r\nand she paid me every cent she promised. I stayed with her three years.\r\n\r\n\"Then I heared of a railroad job in Texas, and married Josie Sewel in a\r\nbig weddin' and we had a great time. I gits a job on that railroad for\r\nfifty cents a day and it never lasted more'n a year, so I goes to\r\nfarmin'.\r\n\r\n\"We had fourteen chillun, four dead now, and the rest farmin' all over\r\nTexas. I has more'n a hundred grandchillun. Josie, she done die twenty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know as I 'spected massa's land to be 'vided and give us, but\r\nthey was plenty of land for everybody, and missy allus treated us right.\r\nWages was terrible small for a long time after I married and sometimes\r\nthey wouldn't pay us, and we had to beg or steal. I's went a whole two\r\ndays without nothin' to eat. If it hadn't been for them there Klu Klux,\r\nsometimes the niggers would have went on the warpath for starvin'. But\r\nthe Klu Kluxers wouldn't let 'em roam none, if they tried they stretch\r\nthem out over a log and hit them with rawhide, but never say a word.\r\nThat was got the niggers--they was so silent, not a sound out of them,\r\nand the nigger he can't stand that.\r\n\r\n\"I gits a pension and works when I can and gits by. Some the young\r\nniggers is purty sorry, they's had so much and don't 'preciate none of\r\nit. I's glad for what I can git, 'cause I 'members them old times after\r\nthe war when it was worse'n now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420178\r\n\r\n\r\n     JEFF CALHOUN, about 98, was born a slave of the Calhoun family, in\r\n     Alton, Alabama. After his master died, a son-in-law, Jim Robinson,\r\n     brought Jeff and 200 other slaves to Austin, Texas. Jeff was 22\r\n     when the Civil War began. He stayed with his old master, who had\r\n     moved to Stewart Mills Texas, after he was freed, and raised 23\r\n     children. He says, \"I 'spect I has near a thous- children,\r\n     grandchildren and great grandchildren.\" He makes his home among\r\n     them, drifting over five states when and as he wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My name am Jeff Calhoun and I was born in Alton, in Alabama, about\r\n1838, 'cause I's told by my massa. Dat makes me 'bout 98 year old now.\r\nMy father was Henry Robinson and my mammy, she Mary Robinson. She was\r\nborn in Maryland, in Virginia, but didn't know much 'bout her folks,\r\n'cause she was sold off young. Dere was four of us brothers and ten\r\nsisters, but dey all dead now but me.\r\n\r\n\"We makes our beds out of forked saplings drove in the ground, 'cause de\r\nfloors was dirt. We sets de pole in dat ground and it run to de top of\r\nde cabin and we makes one bed down low and one bed above. De big folks\r\nsleeps in de low beds and de chillun above, 'cause dey can climb.\r\n\r\n\"My massa had 15 chillun and my mamma suckled every one of dem, 'cause\r\nhis wife was no good to give milk.\r\n\r\n\"We allus had lots to eat, but for meat we has to go to de woods and git\r\ndeer and turkey and buffalo and some bear. I have eat hoss and skunk and\r\ncrow and hawk.\r\n\r\n\"We has a big fire to cook on, and to make de corn cakes we put one leaf\r\ndown and put batter on dat and put another leaf over it and cover with\r\nhot ashes and by noon it was done. Same thing for supper. We never have\r\nbiscuits 'cept on Sunday or Christmas.\r\n\r\n\"My mama was de spinner so I has plenty shirts and some britches, and we\r\nraises indigo on de place and makes dye of it. We never wore no shoes in\r\nde summer and some winters neither. We has a good pair of pants and\r\nshirt we wears Sundays and holidays and was married in.\r\n\r\n\"De way dey done at weddings dem days, you picks out a girl and tell\r\nyour boss. If she was from another plantation you had to git her bosses\r\n'mission and den dey tells you to come up dat night and git hitched up.\r\nThey says to de girl, 'You's love dis man?' Dey says to de man, 'You\r\nloves dis girl?' If you say you don't know, it's all off, but if you say\r\nyes, dey brings in de broom and holds it 'bout a foot off de floor and\r\nsay to you to jump over. Den he says you's married. If either of you\r\nstumps you toe on de broom, dat mean you got trouble comin' 'tween you,\r\nso you sho' jumps high.\r\n\r\n\"My massa was good to us. He lived in a log house with a floor and was\r\nall fixed up with pretty furniture and mirrors and silver on de table.\r\nDe missus was little and frail, but she was good to us and so was de\r\nmassa. He wasn't no hand to whip like some of he neighbors. Dey would\r\ntied de slaves' hands to a pole and whip de blood out of them. Dey was\r\nwhipped for runnin' away.\r\n\r\n\"I knowed a slave call Ben Bradley and he was sold on de auction block\r\nand his massa chained him hand and foot and started for Texas. Dey got\r\nto de Red River and was crossin' and de chains helt him down and he\r\nnever came up. And I have a uncle what run off and dey took a pack of\r\nhounds--a pack were twelve--and dey got on his trail and I heared dem\r\nrunnin' him. Dey run him three days and nights and took a gun loaded\r\nwith buck shot but was sposed not to shoot above de legs. Dey come back\r\nand said he got away, but some boys was out huntin' and finds him and he\r\nbeen shot four times with buck shot.\r\n\r\n\"De only time we got to rest was Sunday and de fourth of July and\r\nChristmas, and one day Thanksgiving. We got de big dinners on holidays.\r\nAfter supper was have corn shuckings, or on rainy days, and sometimes we\r\nshucks 500 bushels. We allus picked de cotton in big baskets, and when\r\nwe gits it all picked we spreads on big and has a celebration.\r\n\r\n\"I was in Texas when de war broke out and I hauls corn lots of times to\r\nde gin where was de soldier camp, and I helped cook awhile and would\r\nhave been in de battle of Vicksburg only dey takes another man 'stead of\r\nme and he gits kilt. I's glad I's a sorry cook, or I'd got kilt 'stead\r\nof him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420262\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Simp Campbell]\r\n\r\n\r\n     SIMP CAMPBELL was born January 1860, in Harrison County, Texas, He\r\n     belonged to W.L. Sloan and stayed with him until 1883, when Simp\r\n     married and moved to Marshall. He and his wife live in Gregg\r\n     Addition, Marshall, Texas, and Simp works as porter for a loan\r\n     company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My name is Simpson Campbell, but everybody, white and black, calls me\r\nSimp. I's born right here in Harrison County, on Bill Sloan's place,\r\nnine miles northwest of Marshall. I got in on the last five years of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\n\"Pappy was Lewis Campbell, and he was sold by the Florida Campbells to\r\nMarse Sloan and fotched to Texas, but he allus kep' the Campbell name.\r\nMammy was Mariah and the Sloans brung her out of South Carolina. She\r\nraised a passel of chillen. Besides me there was Flint, Albert and\r\nClinton of the boys, and--let me count--Dinah, Clandy, Mary, Lula, Liza,\r\nHannah, Matilda and Millie of the girls.\r\n\r\n\"The Sloans lived in a big house, but it wasn't no shanty. They was\r\nfixed 'bout as good as anybody in the county and driv as good hosses and\r\nrigs as anybody. They wasn't a mean streak in the whole Sloan family.\r\n\r\n\"The slave quarters sot in rows right down in the field from the big\r\nhouse. They had beds made to the wall, and all the cookin' was on the\r\nfireplace. We raised all our meat and corn and garden truck right there\r\non the place and Marse Sloan brung wheat and other rations from\r\nShreveport. The nigger women spinned all the cloth and pappy made shoes\r\nby hand, when they kilt a beef. The beef was dried and jetted and hung\r\nin the smokehouse.\r\n\r\n\"Marse's place civered a thousand acres and he had over a hunderd\r\nslaves, with a overseer, Johnson, and a nigger driver. Us niggers was\r\ntreated well but the overseer had order to whip us for fightin'. If the\r\nnigger driver hit too many licks, the overseer sold him off the place.\r\n\r\n\"We worked from four till six and done a task after that, and sot round\r\nand talked till nine and then had to go to bed. On Saturday night you'd\r\nhear them fiddles and banjoes playin' and the niggers singin'. All them\r\nmusic gadgets was homemade. The banjoes was made of round pieces of\r\nwood, civered with sheepskin and strung with catgut strings.\r\n\r\n\"They wasn't no school but Marse Bill larnt some his niggers readin' and\r\nwritin' so we could use them bookin' cotton in the field and sich like.\r\nThey was a church on the Sloan place and white preachers done most the\r\n'xhorting. Mammy allus say the cullud preachers had to preach what\r\nthey's told--obey you master and missus.\r\n\r\n\"I seed Yankee sojers and wagons comin' home from Mansfield. Marse Tom\r\nsot us free right after surrender, but my folks stayed on with him till\r\nhe died, in 1906. I lef when I's twenty-three and marries and made a\r\nlivin' from public work in Marshall all my life. I worked as day laborer\r\nand raised two boys and two girls and the boys is farmin' right here in\r\nthe county and doin' well.\r\n\r\n\"When I's eighteen they got up a 'mendment to the Constitution and got\r\nout a \"People's Party Ticket.\" It was a Democratic ticket and control by\r\nSoutherners. They told us niggers if we'd vote that ticket we'd be\r\nrec'nized as white folks, but I didn't 'lieve a word of it. Old Man\r\nSloan told all his niggers that and they all voted that ticket but\r\ntwo--that was Charley Tang and Simp Campbell.\r\n\r\n\"I 'lieve the young race of our people is progressin' fine. If they had\r\npriv'lege to use they educations, they'd make more progress, but the\r\ncolor line holds them back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420106\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Cape]\r\n\r\n\r\n     JAMES CAPE, centenarian, now living in a dilapidated little shack\r\n     in the rear of the stockyards in Fort Worth, Texas, was born a\r\n     slave to Mr. Bob Houston, who owned a large ranch in southeast\r\n     Texas. James' parents came direct from Africa into slavery. James\r\n     spent his youth as a cowboy, fought in the Confederate army, was\r\n     wounded and has an ugly shoulder scar. After the war, James\r\n     unknowingly took a job with the outlaw, Jesse James, for whom he\r\n     worked three years, in Missouri. He then came back to Texas, and\r\n     worked in the stockyards until 1928. Documentary proof of James'\r\n     age is lacking, but various facts told him by his parents and\r\n     others lead him to think he must be over 100 years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I's bo'n in yonder southeast Texas and I don' know what month or de\r\nyear for sho', but 'twas more dan 100 years ago. My mammy and pappy was\r\nbo'n in Africa, dats what dey's tol' me. Dey was owned by Marster Bob\r\nHouston and him had de ranch down dere, whar dey have cattle and hosses.\r\n\r\n\"When I's old 'nough to set on de hoss, dey larned me to ride, tendin'\r\nhosses. 'Cause I's good hoss rider, dey uses me all de time gwine after\r\nhosses. I goes with dem to Mexico. We crosses de river lots of times. I\r\n'members once when we was a drivin' 'bout 200 hosses north'ards. Dey was\r\na bad hail storm comes into de face of de herd and dat herd turns and\r\nstarts de other way. Dere was five of us riders and we had to keep dem\r\nhosses from scatterment. I was de leader and do you know what happens to\r\ndis nigger if my hoss stumbles? Right dere's whar I'd still be! Marster\r\ngive me a new saddle for savin' de hosses.\r\n\r\n\"One day Marster Bob comes to me and says, 'Jim, how you like to jine de\r\narmy?' You see, de war had started. I says to him, 'What does I have to\r\ndo?' And he says, 'Tend hosses and ride 'em.' I was young den and\r\nthought it would be lots of fun, so I says I'd go. So de first thing I\r\nknows, I's in de army away off east from here, somewhar dis side of St.\r\nLouis and in Tennessee and Arkansas and other places. I goes in de army\r\n'stead of Dr. Carroll.\r\n\r\n\"After I gits in de army, it wasn' so much fun, 'cause tendin' hosses\r\nand ridin' wasn' all I does. No, sar, I has to do shootin' and git\r\nshooted at! One time we stops de train, takes Yankee money and lots of\r\nother things off dat train. Dat was way up de other side of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\"You's heard of de battle of Independence? Dat's whar we fights for\r\nthree days and nights. I's not tendin' hosses dat time. Dey gives me a\r\nrifle and sends me up front fightin', when we wasn' running'. We does a\r\nheap of runnin' and dat suits dis nigger. I could do dat better'n\r\nadvance. When de order comes to 'treat, I's all ready.\r\n\r\n\"I gits shot in de shoulder in dat fight and lots of our soldiers gits\r\nkilled and we loses our supply, jus' leaves it and runs. 'Nother time we\r\nfights two days and nights and de Yankees was bad dat time, too, and we\r\nhad to run through de river. I sho' thought I's gwine git drowned den.\r\nDat's de time we tries to git in St. Louis, but de Yankee mans stop us.\r\n\r\n\"I's free after de war and goes back to Texas, to Gonzales County, and\r\ngits a job doin' cowboy work for Marster Ross herdin' cattle. And right\r\ndere's whar I's lucky for not gittin' in jail or hanged. It was dis\r\nway: I's in town and dat man, Ross, says to me, 'I unnerstan' you's a\r\ngood cowhand,' and he hires me and takes me way out. No house for miles\r\n'fore we comes to de ranch with cattle and I goes to work. After I's\r\nworkin' a while, I wonders how come dey brings in sich fine steers so\r\noften and I says to myself, 'Marster Ross mus' have heaps of money for\r\nto buy all dem steers.' Dey pays no 'tention to de raisin' of cattle,\r\njus' brings 'em in and drives dem 'way.\r\n\r\n\"One time Marster Ross and six mens was gone a week and when dey comes\r\nback, one of 'em was missin'. Dey had no steers dat time and dey talks\r\n'bout gittin' frusterated and how one man gits shot. I says to myself,\r\n'What for was dey chased and shot at?' Den I 'members Marster Bob\r\nHouston done tol' me 'bout rustlers and how dey's hanged when dey's\r\ncaught, and I knows den dat's how come all dem fine steers is driv in\r\nand out all de time. But how to git 'way, dere's de puzzlement. I not\r\nknow which way to go and dere's no houses anywhere near. I keeps gittin'\r\nscarter, and ever' time somebody comes, I thinks its de law. But Marster\r\nRoss drives de cattle north and I says to him, 'I's good hand at de\r\ndrive. Kin I go with you nex' time you goes north?' And not long after\r\ndat we starts and we gits to Kansas City. After Marster Ross gets shut\r\nof de critters, he says. 'We'll res' for couple days, den starts back.'\r\nI says to me, 'Not dis nigger.'\r\n\r\n\"I sneaks 'way and was settin' on a bench when 'long comes a white man\r\nand he's tall, had dark hair and was fine lookin'. He says to me, 'Is\r\nyou a cowhand?' So I tells him I is, and he says he wants a hand on his\r\nfarm in Missouri and he says, 'Come with me.' He tells me his name was\r\nJames and takes me to his farm whar I tends cattle and hosses for three\r\nyears and he pays me well. He gives me more'n I earns. After three years\r\nI leaves, but not 'cause I larned he was outlaw, 'cause I larned dat\r\nlong time afterwa'ds. I's lonesome for Texas and dat's how I comes to\r\nFort Worth and here's whar I's stayed ever' since.\r\n\r\n\"I's married 'bout 40 years ago to a woman dat had eight chillens. We\r\nsep'rated 'cause dem chillens cause arg'ments. I can fight one, but not\r\nde army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420180\r\n\r\n\r\n     RICHARD CARRUTHERS, 100 year old ex-slave, was born in Memphis,\r\n     Tennessee. Mr. Billy Coats bought him and his mother and brought\r\n     them to Bastrop Co., Texas. He came to Houston 20 years ago and\r\n     lives in a negro settlement known as Acres Home, about 8 miles\r\n     northeast of Houston. It is a wooded section, with a clearing here\r\n     and there for a Negro shack and plots of ground for growing\r\n     \"victuals and co'n.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I wants to tell the Gospel truf. My mammy's name was Melia Carruthers\r\nand my papa's name was Max. My papa's papa's name was Carruthers, too.\r\nMy brothers names was Charlie and Frank and Willie and John and Tom and\r\nAdam.\r\n\r\n\"When I was still little Mr. Billy Coats bought my mama and us and with\r\nabout 500 of his slaves we set out to come to Texas. We goes to Bastrop\r\nCounty and starts to work. My old missy--her name was Missy Myra--was 99\r\nyear old and her head was bald as a egg and had wens on it as big as\r\neggs, too.\r\n\r\n\"In them days the boss men had good houses but the niggers had log\r\ncabins and they burned down oftentimes. The chimney would cotch fire,\r\n'cause it was made out of sticks and clay and moss. Many the time we\r\nhave to git up at midnight and push the chimney 'way from the house to\r\nkeep the house from burnin' up.\r\n\r\n\"The chairs was mostly chunks of cordwood put on end, or slabs, just\r\nrough, and the beds was built like scaffoldin'. We made a sort of\r\nmattress out of corn shucks or moss.\r\n\r\n\"My missy, she was good, but the overseer, he rough. His temper born of\r\nthe debbil, himse'f. His name was Tom Hill, but us called him 'Debbil\r\nHill.'\r\n\r\nOld Debbil Hill, he used to whup me and the other niggers if we don't\r\njump quick enough when he holler and he stake us out like you stake out\r\na hide and whup till we bleed. Many the time I set down and made a\r\neight-plait whup, so he could whup from the heels to the back of the\r\nhead 'til he figger he get the proper ret'ibution. Sometime he take salt\r\nand rub on the nigger so he smart and burn proper and suffer mis'ry.\r\nThey was a caliboose right on the plantation, what look like a\r\nice-house, and it was sho' bad to git locked up in it.\r\n\r\n\"Us got provisions 'lowanced to us every Saturday night. If you had two\r\nin the family, they 'lowanced you one-half gallon 'lasses and 12 to 15\r\npounds bacon and a peck of meal. We have to take the meal and parch it\r\nand make coffee out of it. We had our flours. One of them we called\r\nbiscuit flour and we called it 'shorts.' We had rye and wheat and buck\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\n\"If they didn't provision you 'nough, you jus' had to slip 'round and\r\ngit a chicken. That easy 'nough, but grabbin' a pig a sho' 'nough\r\nproblem. You have to cotch him by the snoot so he won't squeal, and\r\nclomp him tight while you knife him. That ain't stealin', is it? You has\r\nto keep right on workin' in the field, if you ain't 'lowanced 'nough,\r\nand no nigger like to work with his belly groanin'.\r\n\r\n\"When the white preacher come he preach and pick up his Bible and claim\r\nhe gittin the text right out from the good Book and he preach: 'The Lord\r\nsay, don't you niggers steal chickens from your missus. Don't you steal\r\nYOUR MARSTER'S hawgs.' That would be all he preach.\r\n\r\n\"Us niggers used to have a prayin' ground down in the hollow and\r\nsometime we come out of the field, between 11 and 12 at night, scorchin'\r\nand burnin' up with nothin' to eat, and we wants to ask the good Lawd to\r\nhave mercy. We puts grease in a snuff pan or bottle and make a lamp. We\r\ntakes a pine torch, too, and goes down in the hollow to pray. Some gits\r\nso joyous they starts to holler loud and we has to stop up they mouth. I\r\nsee niggers git so full of the Lawd and so happy they draps unconscious.\r\n\r\n\"I kep' a eye on the niggers down in the cotton patch. Sometime they\r\nlazy 'round and if I see the overseer comin' from the big house I sings\r\na song to warn 'em, so they not git whupped, and it go like this:\r\n\r\n\"'Hold up, hold up, American Spirit!\r\nHold up, hold up, H-O-O-O-O-O-O-O!'\r\n\r\n\"We used to go huntin' and they was lots of game, bears and panthers and\r\ncoons. We have bear dawgs, fox dawg and rabbit dawg that mostly jus' go\r\nby the name of houn' dawg. Then they have a dawg to run niggers.\r\n\r\n\"I never tried the conjure, but they would take hair and brass nails and\r\nthimbles and needles and mix them up in a conjure bag. But I knows one\r\nthing. They was a old gin between Wilbarger and Colorado and it was\r\nhanted with spirits of kilt niggers. Us used to hear that old mill\r\nhummin' when dark come and we slip up easy, but it stop, then when you\r\nslip away it start up.\r\n\r\n\"I 'member when the stars fell. We runs and prays, 'cause we thinks it\r\njedgment day. It sure dumb old Debbil Hill, them stars was over his\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\"On Sundays we put shoes on our feet and they was brass toed. They was\r\nso hard and stiff they go 'tump, tump, tump,' when we walk. That's the\r\nonly day we got 'cept Christmas and we jus' got somethin' extry to eat.\r\nAll them women sho' knowed how to cook! I often tell my wife how glad I\r\nwas one mornin' when my missy give me a hot, butter biscuit. I goes down\r\nand shows it to all the other boys. We didn't git them hot, butter\r\nbiscuits in them days.\r\n\r\n\"I used to dance the pigeon wing and swing my partners 'round. Was them\r\nwomenfolks knock-kneed? You sho' couldn't tell, even when you swung 'em\r\n'round, 'cause they dresses was so long.\r\n\r\n\"I's been all 'round the mountain and up on top of it in my day. Durin'\r\nslave time I been so cold I mos' turn white and they sot me 'fore the\r\nfire and poultice me with sliced turnips. Come a norther and it blow\r\nwith snow and sleet and I didn't have 'nough clothes to keep me warm.\r\n\r\n\"When a nigger marry, he slick up his lowers and put on his brass-toed\r\nshoes, then the preacher marry him out of the Bible. My pappy have a\r\npass to visit my mammy and if he don't have one, the paddle roller conk\r\nhim on the head. My grandma and grandpa come here in a steamboat. The\r\nman come to Africa and say, 'Man and woman, does you want a job?' So\r\nthey gits on the boat and then he has the 'vantage.\r\n\r\n\"When I was 21 and some more, I don't know jus' how old, I was a free\r\nman. That the day I shouted. We niggers scattered like partridges. I had\r\na fiddle and I'd play for the white folks wherever I went, when they has\r\nthe balls. I marries after 'while, but I don't know what year, 'cause we\r\nnever done paid no 'tention to years. My first wife died after a long\r\ntime, I think 'bout 34 year and I married another and she died this very\r\nyear. Jus' three months later I marries my housekeeper, named Luvena\r\nDixon, cause I allus lived a upright life and I knowed the Lawd wouldn't\r\nlike it if I went on livin' in the same house with Luvena without we was\r\nmarried. She is 52 year old, and we is happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420216\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cato Carter]\r\n\r\n\r\n     CATO CARTER was born in 1836 or 1837, near Pineapple, Wilcox\r\n     County, Alabama, a slave of the Carter family. He and his wife live\r\n     at 3429 Booth St., Dallas, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm home today 'cause my li'l, old dog is lost and I has to stay 'round\r\nto hunt for him. I been goin' every day on the truck to the cotton\r\npatches. I don't pick no more, 'count my hands git too tired and begin\r\nto cramp on me. But I go and set in the field and watch the lunches for\r\nthe other hands.\r\n\r\n\"I am a hunerd one years old, 'cause I's twenty-eight, goin' on\r\ntwenty-nine, a man growned, when the breakin' up come. I'm purty old,\r\nbut my folks live that way. My old, black mammy, Zenie Carter, lived to\r\nbe a hunerd twenty-five, and Oll Carter, my white massa--which was the\r\nbrother of my daddy--lived to be a hunerd four. He ain't been so long\r\ndied. Al Carter, my own daddy, lived to be very ageable, but I don't\r\nknow when he died.\r\n\r\n\"Back in Alabama, Missie Adeline Carter took me when I was past my\r\ncreepin' days to live in the big house with the white folks. I had a\r\nroom built on the big house, where I stayed, and they was allus good to\r\nme, 'cause I's one of their blood. They never hit me a lick or slapped\r\nme once, and told me they'd never sell me away from them. They was the\r\nbes' quality white folks and lived in a big, two-story house with a big\r\nhall what run all the way through the house. They wasn't rough as some\r\nwhite folks on their niggers.\r\n\r\n\"My mammy lived in a hewn-oak log cabin in the quarters. There was a\r\nlong row of cabins, some bigger than t'others, 'count of fam'ly size. My\r\nmassa had over eighty head of slaves. Them li'l, old cabins was cozy,\r\n'cause we chinked 'em with mud and they had stick chimneys daubed with\r\nmud, mixed with hawg-hair.\r\n\r\n\"The fixin's was jus' plain things. The beds was draw-beds--wooden\r\nbedsteads helt together with ropes drawed tight, to hold them. We\r\nscalded moss and buried it awhile and stuffed it into tickin' to make\r\nmattresses. Them beds slep' good, better'n the ones nowadays.\r\n\r\n\"There was a good fireplace for cookin' and Sundays the Missie give us\r\nniggers a pint of flour and a chicken, for to cook a mess of victuals.\r\nThen there was plenty game to find. Many a time I've kilt seventy-five\r\nor eighty squirrels out of one big beech. There was lots of deer and\r\nbears and quails and every other kind of game, but when they ran the\r\nIndians out of the country, the game jus' followed the Indians. I've\r\nseed the bigges' herds of deer followin' the way the Indians drifted.\r\nWhenever the Indians lef', the game all lef' with them, for some reason\r\nI dunno.\r\n\r\n\"Talkin' 'bout victuals, our eatin' was good. Can't say the same for all\r\nplaces. Some of the plantations half starved their niggers and 'lowanced\r\nout their eatin' till they wasn't fittin' for work. They had to slip\r\nabout to niggers on other places to piece out their meals. They had\r\nfield calls and other kinds of whoops and hollers, what had a meanin' to\r\n'em.\r\n\r\n\"Our place was fifteen hunerd acres in one block, and 'sides the crops\r\nof cotton and corn and rice and ribbon cane we raised in the bottoms, we\r\nhad veg'tables and sheep and beef. We dried the beef on scaffolds we\r\nbuilt and I used to tend it. But bes' of anythin' to eat, I liked a big,\r\nfat coon, and I allus liked honey. Some the niggers had li'l garden\r\npatches they tended for themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Everythin' I tell you am the truth, but they's plenty I can't tell you.\r\nI heard plenty things from my mammy and grandpappy. He was a fine diver\r\nand used to dive in the Alabama river for things what was wrecked out of\r\nboats, and the white folks would git him to go down for things they\r\nwanted. They'd let him down by a rope to find things on the bottom of\r\nthe riverbed. He used to git a piece of money for doin' it.\r\n\r\n\"My grandmammy was a juksie, 'cause her mammy was a nigger and her daddy\r\na Choctaw Indian. That's what makes me so mixed up with Indian and\r\nAfrican and white blood. Sometimes it mattered to me, sometimes it\r\ndidn't. It don't no more, 'cause I'm not too far from the end of my\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\"I had one brother and one sister I helped raise. They was mostly\r\nnigger. The Carters told me never to worry 'bout them, though, 'cause my\r\nmammy was of their blood and all of us in our fam'ly would never be\r\nsold, and sometime they'd make free man and women of us. My brother and\r\nsister lived with the niggers, though.\r\n\r\n\"I was trained for a houseboy and to tend the cows. The bears was so bad\r\nthen, a 'sponsible pusson who could carry a gun had to look after them.\r\n\r\n\"My massa used to give me a li'l money 'long, to buy what I wanted. I\r\nallus bought fine clothes. In the summer when I was a li'l one, I wore\r\nlowerin's, like the rest of the niggers. That was things made from\r\ncotton sackin'. Most the boys wore shirttails till they was big\r\nyearlin's. When they bought me red russets from the town, I cried and\r\ncried. I didn't want to wear no rawhide shoes. So they took 'em back.\r\nThey had a weakness for my cryin'. I did have plenty fine clothes, good\r\nwoolen suits they spinned on the place, and doeskins and fine linens. I\r\ndruv in the car'age with the white folks and was 'bout the mos' dudish\r\nnigger in them parts.\r\n\r\n\"I used to tend the nurslin' thread. The reason they called it that was\r\nwhen the mammies was confined with babies havin' to suck, they had to\r\nspin. I'd take them the thread and bring it back to the house when it\r\nwas spinned. If they didn't spin seven or eight cuts a day, they'd git a\r\nwhuppin'. It was consid'ble hard on a woman when she had a frettin'\r\nbaby. But every mornin' them babies had to be took to the big house, so\r\nthe white folks could see if they's dressed right. They was money tied\r\nup in li'l nigger young'uns.\r\n\r\n\"They whupped the women and they whupped the mens. I used to work some\r\nin the tan'ry and we made the whips. They'd tie them down to a stob, and\r\ngive 'em the whuppin'. Some niggers, it taken four men to whup 'em, but\r\nthey got it. The nigger driver was meaner than the white folks. They'd\r\nbetter not leave a blade of grass in the rows. I seed 'em beat a nigger\r\nhalf a day to make him 'fess up to stealin' a sheep or a shoat. Or\r\nthey'd whup 'em for runnin' away, but not so hard if they come back of\r\ntheir own 'cordance when they got hungry and sick in the swamps. But\r\nwhen they had to run 'em down with the nigger dogs, they'd git in bad\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n\"The Carters never did have any real 'corrigible niggers, but I heard of\r\n'em plenty on other places. When they was real 'corrigible, the white\r\nfolks said they was like mad dogs and didn't mind to kill them so much\r\nas killin' a sheep. They'd take 'em to the graveyard and shoot 'em down\r\nand bury 'em face downward, with their shoes on. I never seed it done,\r\nbut they made some the niggers go for a lesson to them that they could\r\ngit the same.\r\n\r\n\"But I didn't even have to carry a pass to leave my own place, like the\r\nother niggers. I had a cap with a sign on it: 'Don't bother this\r\nnigger, or there will be Hell to pay.' I went after the mail, in the\r\ntown. It come in coaches and they put on fresh hosses at Pineapple. The\r\ncoachman run the hosses into Pineapple with a big to-do and blowin' the\r\nbugle to git the fresh hosses ready. I got the mail. I was a trusty all\r\nmy days and never been 'rested by the law to this day.\r\n\r\n\"I never had no complaints for my treatment, but some the niggers hated\r\nsyrup makin' time, 'cause when they had to work till midnight makin'\r\nsyrup, its four o'clock up, jus' the same. Sun-up to sundown was for\r\nfiel' niggers.\r\n\r\n\"Corn shuckin' was fun. Them days no corn was put in the cribs with\r\nshucks on it. They shucked it in the fiel' and shocked the fodder. They\r\ndid it by sides and all hands out. A beef was kilt and they'd have a\r\nreg'lar picnic feastin'. They was plenty whiskey for the niggers, jus'\r\nlike Christmas.\r\n\r\n\"Christmas was the big day at the Carter's. Presents for every body, and\r\nthe bakin' and preparin' went on for days. The li'l ones and the big\r\nones were glad, 'specially the nigger mens, 'count of plenty good\r\nwhiskey. Mr. Oll Carter got the bes' whiskey for his niggers.\r\n\r\n\"We used to have frolics, too. Some niggers had fiddles and played the\r\nreels, and niggers love to dance and sing and eat.\r\n\r\n\"Course niggers had their ser'ous side, too. They loved to go to church\r\nand had a li'l log chapel for worship. But I went to the white folks\r\nchurch. In the chapel some nigger mens preached from the Bible, but\r\ncouldn't read a line no more than a sheep could. The Carters didn't mind\r\ntheir niggers prayin' and singin' hymns, but some places wouldn't 'low\r\nthem to worship a-tall, and they had to put their heads in pots to sing\r\nor pray.\r\n\r\n\"Mos' the niggers I know, who had their mar'age put in the book, did it\r\nafter the breakin' up, plenty after they had growned chillen. When they\r\ngot married on the places, mostly they jus' jumped over a broom and\r\nthat made 'em married. Sometimes one the white folks read a li'l out of\r\nthe Scriptures to 'em and they felt more married.\r\n\r\n\"Take me, I was never one for sickness. But the slaves used to git sick.\r\nThere was jaundice in them bottoms. First off they'd give some castor\r\noil, and if that didn't cure they'd give blue mass. Then if he was still\r\nsick they'd git a doctor.\r\n\r\n\"They used to cry the niggers off jus' like so much cattle, and we\r\ndidn't think no diff'rent of it. I seed them put them on the block and\r\nbrag on them somethin' big. Everybody liked to hear them cry off\r\nniggers. The cryer was a clown and made funny talk and kep' everybody\r\nlaughin'.\r\n\r\n\"When massa and the other mens on the place went off to war, he called\r\nme and said, 'Cato, you's allus been a 'sponsible man, and I leave you\r\nto look after the women and the place. If I don't come back, I want you\r\nto allus stay by Missie Adeline! I said, 'Fore Gawd, I will, Massa Oll.'\r\nHe said, 'Then I can go away peaceable.'\r\n\r\n\"We thought for a long time the sojers had the Fed'rals whupped to\r\npieces, but there was plenty bad times to go through. I carried a gun\r\nand guarded the place at nighttime. The paddyrollers was bad. I cotched\r\none and took him to the house more'n once. They wore black caps and put\r\nblack rags over their faces and was allus skullduggerying 'round at\r\nnight. We didn't use torches any more when we went 'round at night,\r\n'cause we was afeared. We put out all the fires 'round the house at\r\nnighttime.\r\n\r\n\"The young mens in grey uniforms used to pass so gay and singin', in the\r\nbig road. Their clothes was good and we used to feed them the best we\r\nhad on the place. Missie Adeline would say, 'Cato, they is our boys and\r\ngive them the best this place 'fords.' We taken out the hams and the\r\nwine and kilt chickens for them. That was at first.\r\n\r\n\"Then the boys and mens in blue got to comin' that way, and they was\r\nfine lookin' men, too. Missie Adeline would cry and say, 'Cato, they is\r\njust mens and boys and we got to feed them, too.' We had a pavilion\r\nbuilt in the yard, like they had at picnics, and we fed the Fed'rals in\r\nthat. Missie Adeline set in to cryin' and says to the Yankees, 'Don't\r\ntake Cato. He is the only nigger man I got by me now. If you take Cato,\r\nI just don't know what I'll do.' I tells them sojers I got to stay by\r\nMissie Adeline so long as I live. The Yankee mens say to her, 'Don't\r\n'sturb youself, we ain't gwine to take Cato or harm nothin' of yours.'\r\nThe reason they's all right by us, was 'cause we prepared for them, but\r\nwith some folks they was rough somethin' ter'ble. They taken off their\r\nhosses and corn.\r\n\r\n\"I seed the trees bend low and shake all over and heard the roar and\r\npoppin' of cannon balls. There was springs not too far from our place\r\nand the sojers used to camp there and build a fire and cook a mule,\r\n'cause they'd got down to starvation. When some of the guerillas seed\r\nthe fire they'd aim to it, and many a time they spoiled that dinner for\r\nthem sojers. The Yankees did it and our boys did it, too. There was\r\nkillin' goin' on so ter'ble, like people was dogs.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Oll come back and he was all wore out and ragged. He soon called\r\nall the niggers to the front yard and says, 'Mens and womens, you are\r\ntoday as free as I am. You are free to do as you like, 'cause the damned\r\nYankees done 'creed you are. They ain't a nigger on my place what was\r\nborn here or ever lived here who can't stay here and work and eat to the\r\nend of his days, as long as this old place will raise peas and goobers.\r\nGo if you wants, and stay if you wants.' Some of the niggers stayed and\r\nsome went, and some what had run away to the North come back. They allus\r\ncalled, real humble like, at the back gate to Missie Adeline, and she\r\nallus fixed it up with Massa Oll they could have a place.\r\n\r\n\"Near the close of the war I seed some folks leavin' for Texas. They\r\nsaid if the Fed'rals won the war they'd have to live in Texas to keep\r\nslaves. So plenty started driftin' their slaves to the west. They'd pass\r\nwith the womens ridin' in the wagons and the mens on foot. Some took\r\nslaves to Texas after the Fed'rals done 'creed the breakin' up.\r\n\r\n\"Long as I lived I minded what my white folks told me, 'cept one time.\r\nThey was a nigger workin' in the fiel' and he kept jerkin' the mules and\r\nMassa Oll got mad, and he give me a gun and said, 'Go out there and kill\r\nthat man.' I said, 'Massa Oll, please don't tell me that. I ain't never\r\nkilt nobody and I don't want to.' He said, 'Cato, you do what I tell\r\nyou.' He meant it. I went out to the nigger and said, 'You has got to\r\nleave this minute, and I is, too, 'cause I is 'spose to kill you, only I\r\nain't and Massa Oll will kill me.' He drops the hanes and we run and\r\ncrawled through the fence and ran away.\r\n\r\n\"I hated to go, 'cause things was so bad, and flour sold for $25.00 a\r\nbarrel, and pickled pork for $15.00 a barrel. You couldn't buy nothin'\r\nlessen with gold. I had plenty of 'federate money, only it wouldn't buy\r\nnothin'.\r\n\r\n\"But today I is a old man and my hands ain't stained with no blood. I is\r\nallus been glad I didn't kill that man.\r\n\r\n\"Mules run to a ter'ble price then. A right puny pair of mules sold for\r\n$500.00. But the Yankees give me a mule and I farmed a year for a white\r\nman and watched a herd of mules, too. I stayed with them mules till four\r\no'clock even Sundays. So many scoundrels was goin' 'bout, stealin'\r\nmules.\r\n\r\n\"That year I was boun' out by 'greement with the white man, and I made\r\n$360.00. The bureau come by that year lookin' at nigger's contracts, to\r\nsee they didn't git skunt out their rightful wages. Missie Adeline and\r\nMassa Oll didn't stay mad at me and every Sunday they come by to see me,\r\nand brung me li'l del'cate things to eat.\r\n\r\n\"The Carters said a hunerd times they regretted they never larned me to\r\nread or write, and they said my daddy done put up $500.00 for me to go\r\nto the New Allison school for cullud folks. Miss Benson, a Yankee, was\r\nthe teacher. I was twenty-nine years old and jus' startin' in the\r\nblueback speller. I went to school a while, but one mornin' at ten\r\no'clock my poor old mammy come by and called me out. She told me she got\r\nput out, 'cause she too old to work in the fiel'. I told her not to\r\nworry, that I'm the family man now, and she didn't never need to git any\r\nmore three-quarter hand wages no more.\r\n\r\n\"So I left school and turnt my hand to anything I could find for years.\r\nI never had no trouble findin' work, 'cause all the white folks knowed\r\nCato was a good nigger. I lef' my mammy with some fine white folks and\r\nshe raised a whole family of chillen for them. Their name was Bryan and\r\nthey lived on a li'l bayou. Them young'uns was crazy 'bout mammy and\r\nthey'd send me word not to worry about her, 'cause she'd have the bes'\r\nof care and when she died they'd tend to her buryin'.\r\n\r\n\"Finally I come to Texas, 'cause I thought there was money for the\r\ntakin' out here. I got a job splittin' rails for two years and from then\r\non I farmed, mostly. I married a woman and lived with her forty-seven\r\nyears, rain or shine. We had thirteen chillen and eight of them is\r\nlivin' today.\r\n\r\n\"Endurin' the big war I got worried 'bout my li'l black mammy and I\r\nwanted to go back home and see her and the old places. I went, and she\r\nwas shriveled up to not much of anything. That's the last time I saw\r\nher. But for forty-four years I didn't forget to send her things I\r\nthought she'd want. I saw Massa Oll and he done married after I left and\r\nraised a family of chillen. I saw Missie Adeline and she was a old\r\nwoman. We went out and looked at the tombstones and the rock\r\nmarkers in the graveyard on the old place, and some of them done near\r\nmelted away. I looked good at lots of things, 'cause I knowed I wouldn't\r\nbe that way 'gain. So many had gone on since I'd been there befo'.\r\n\r\n\"After my first wife died I married 'gain and my wife is a good woman\r\nbut she's old and done lost her voice, and has to be in Terrell most the\r\ntime. But I git 'long all right, 'cept my hands cramps some.\r\n\r\n\"You goin' take my picture? I lived through plenty and I lived a long\r\ntime, but this is the first time I ever had my picture took. If I'd\r\nknowed you wanted to do that, I'd have tidied up and put on my best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420276\r\n\r\n\r\n     JACK CAUTHERN, 85, was born near Austin, Texas. Dick Townes owned\r\n     Jack and his parents. After they were freed, the family stayed on\r\n     the plantation, but Jack went to San Angelo, because \"times was too\r\n     dull in Travis County.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My master was Dick Townes and my folks come with him from Alabama. He\r\nowned a big plantation fifteen miles from Austin and worked\r\nlots of slaves. We had the best master in the whole county, and\r\neverybody called us \"Townes' free niggers,\" he was so good to us, and we\r\nworked hard for him, raisin' cotton and corn and wheat and oats.\r\n\r\n\"Most the slaves lived in two-room log cabins with dirt floors, over in\r\nthe quarters, but I lived in master's yard. That's where I was born.\r\nThere was a tall fence 'tween the yard and the quarters and the other\r\nnigger boys was so jealous of me they wouldn't let me cross that fence\r\ninto the quarters. They told me I thinked I was white, jes' for livin'\r\nin master's yard.\r\n\r\n\"Me and young master had the good times. He was nigh my age and we'd\r\nsteal chickens from Old Miss and go down in the orchard and barbecue\r\n'em. One time she cotched us and sho' wore us out! She'd send us to pick\r\npeas, but few peas we picked!\r\n\r\n\"Old Miss was good to her cullud folks. When she'd hear a baby cryin' in\r\nthe night she'd put on boots and take her lantern and go see about it.\r\nIf we needed a doctor she'd send for old Dr. Rector and when I had the\r\nmeasles he give me some pills big as the end of my finger.\r\n\r\n\"We went to church all the time. Young Miss come over Sunday mornin' and\r\nfotched all us chillen to the house and read the Bible to us. She was\r\nkind of a old maid and that was her pleasure. We had baptisin's, too.\r\nOne old cullud man was a preacher. Lawd, Lawd, we had shoutin' at them\r\ncamp meetin's!\r\n\r\n\"I guess we was glad to be free. Old master done die and Old Miss was\r\nmanagin' the plantation. She had the whole bunch in the yard and read\r\nthe freedom paper. The old slaves knowed what it meant, but us young\r\nones didn't. She told everybody they could stay and work on shares and\r\nmost of 'em did, but some went back to they old homes in Alabama.\r\n\r\n\"I stayed a while and married, and came to San Angelo. The reason I\r\ncome, times was dull in Travis County and I done hear so much talk 'bout\r\nthis town I said I was comin' and see for myself. That was in 1900 and\r\nit was jes' a forest here then. I worked eighteen years in McCloskey's\r\nsaloon, and he gave me ten dollars every Christmas 'sides my pay and a\r\nsuit every year. I wish he was livin' now. My wife and I was together\r\nfifty-two years and then she died. After a long time I married again,\r\nand my wife is out pickin' cotton now.\r\n\r\n\"It seem mighty hard to me now by side of old times, but I don't know if\r\nit was any better in slavery days. It seems mighty hard though, since\r\nI'm old and can't work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420154\r\n\r\n\r\n     SALLY BANKS CHAMBERS, wife of Ben Chambers of Liberty, does not\r\n     know her age. She was born a slave of Jim Moore, in Oakland,\r\n     Louisiana. Sally has been married three times and has had seven\r\n     children, about 54 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. Heavy\r\n     gold earrings hang from her ears and she dresses, even in\r\n     midsummer, in a long-sleeved calico shirt, heavy socks and shoes,\r\n     and a sweeping skirt many yards wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Befo' I marry de first time my name am Sally Banks, and I's borned in\r\nde old states, over in Louisiana, round Oakland.

Jeptha was sent to school with the white\r\n     children, and after he was freed, he was sent to school for several\r\n     years, and became a teacher. He moved to Houston in 1888 and opened\r\n     a barber shop. Jeptha claims to have been born on Oct. 17, 1835,\r\n     which would make him 101 years old. He has the appearance of\r\n     extreme age, but has a retentive memory, and his manner of speaking\r\n     varies from fairly good English to typical Negro dialect and idiom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'll be 102 years old, come fall, 'cause my mother told me I was born\r\non Oct. 17, 1835, and besides, I was about 30 years old at the end of\r\nthe Civil War. We belonged to the Choices and I was born on their\r\nplantation. My mother's name was Martha and she had been brought here\r\nfrom Serbia. My father's name was John and he was from the East Indies.\r\nThey was brought to this country in a slave boat owned by Captain Adair\r\nand sold to someone at New Orleans before Master Jezro Choice bought\r\nthem. I had five sisters and one brother but they are all dead, 'cepting\r\none brother who lives near Henderson.\r\n\r\n\"Master Jezro was right kind. He had 50 or 60 slaves and a grist mill\r\nand tannery besides the plantation. My white folks sort of picked me out\r\nand I went to school with the white children. I went to the fields when\r\nI was about 20, but I didn't do much field works, 'cause they was\r\nkeepin' me good and they didn't want to strain me.\r\n\r\n\"On Sunday we just put an old Prince Albert coat on some good nigger and\r\nmade a preacher out of him. We niggers had our band, too, and I was one\r\nof the players.\r\n\r\n\"The master was mighty careful about raisin' healthy nigger families and\r\nused us strong, healthy young bucks to stand the healthy nigger gals.\r\nWhen I was young they took care not to strain me and I was as handsome\r\nas a speckled pup and was in demand for breedin'. Later on we niggers\r\nwas 'lowed to marry and the master and missus would fix the nigger and\r\ngal up and have the doin's in the big house. The white folks would\r\ngather round in a circle with the nigger and gal in the center and then\r\nmaster laid a broom on the floor and they held hands and jumped over it.\r\nThat married 'em for good.\r\n\r\n\"When babies was born old nigger grannies handled them cases, but until\r\nthey was about three years old they wasn't 'lowed round the quarters,\r\nbut was wet nursed by women who didn't work in the field and kept in\r\nseparate quarters and in the evenin' their mammies were let to see 'em.\r\n\r\n\"We was fed good and had lots of beef and hawg meat and wild game.\r\nPossum and sweet yams is mighty good. You parboil the possum about half\r\ndone and put him in a skewer pan and put him in a hot oven and just\r\n'fore he is done you puts the yams in the pan and sugar on 'em. That's a\r\nfeast.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes when they's short of bread the old missus would say, 'How\r\n'bout some ash cakes?' Then they'd mix cornmeal and water and sweep\r\nashes out of the open hearth and bake the ash cakes.\r\n\r\n\"The master and his boys was all kilt in the war and after freedom I\r\nstayed all summer. It was pretty tough on us niggers for a while, 'cause\r\nthe womenfolks what was left after the war didn't have money. But\r\nColonel Jones, the master's son-in-law, took me to live in Henderson and\r\npaid twenty-five cents a week for more schoolin' for me and I learned\r\nthrough fractions. Then I got me a job teachin' school about six months\r\na year and in off times I'd farm. I did lots of different kinds of work,\r\non the narrow gauge railroad out of Longview and I learned to be a\r\nbarber, too. But I had to give it up a few years back 'cause I can't\r\nstand up so long any more and now I'm tryin' to help my people by divine\r\nhealing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420243\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Amos Clark's Sorghun Mill]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Amos Clark]\r\n\r\n\r\n     AMOS CLARK, 96, was born a slave of Robert Clark, in Washington\r\n     County, Texas.

Mammy say dat de year,\r\n'cause Marse Bob's brother, Tom, done go tradin' and has a lot of\r\ntrouble with de Indians, and come back with scars all over he arms. It\r\nwarn't all dey fault, 'cause Marse Tom allus gittin' in trouble with\r\nsomebody.\r\n\r\n\"When I was still half-growed, Marse Bob traded me to Marse Ed\r\nRoseborough, and we come to Belton to live. Us piled ox wagons high with\r\nbeddin' and clothes and sich, and Old Marse had he books in a special\r\nhorsehair trunk, what de hide still had hair on. It had brass tacks all\r\ntrimmin' it up, and it was sho' a fine trunk, and he say, 'Amos, you\r\nblack rascal, keep you eye on dat trunk, and don't git it wet crossin'\r\nde water and don't let no Indian git it.' Us had a sizeable drove of\r\ncattle and some sheep and pigs and chickens and ducks.\r\n\r\n\"Marse and Missis finds where dey wants de house and us gits dem axes\r\nout and in a few days dere am a nice log house with two big rooms and a\r\nhall 'tween dem, mos' as big as de rooms. Us been on de road 'bout six\r\nweeks and Missis sho' proud of her new house. Den us makes logs into\r\nhouses for us and a big kitchen close to de big house. Den us builds a\r\noffice for Old Marse and makes chairs and beds and tables for everybody.\r\nOld Miss brung her bed and a spindly, li'l table, and us make all de\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n\"For eatin' de good shooters and scouters gits birds and rabbits and\r\nwild turkeys and sometimes a lot of wild eggs or honey, when dey chops a\r\nbee tree down. A old Indian come to holp us hunt. He'd work a week if\r\nMarse Ed give him some red calico or a hatchet. Old Miss done bring a\r\ndozen hens and a bag of seeds, and folks come ridin' twenty miles to\r\nswap things.\r\n\r\n\"Dere warn't no mill to grind corn, so de boss carpenter, he hollows out\r\na log and gits some smooth, hard rocks and us grind de corn like it was\r\na morter. Old Man Stubblefield builded a watermill on de creek 'bout\r\neight miles from us, and den us tooken de corn dere.\r\n\r\n\"Dere was three hundred acres and more'n fifty slaves, and lots of work,\r\nclearin' and buildin' and plantin'. Some de cabins didn't git no floor\r\nfor two years. Jes' quick as dey could, de men gits out clapboards for\r\nde walls and split puncheon slabs for floors and palin's for fences.\r\n\r\n\"Missis, she takes two de likelies' young slaves and makes a garden,\r\ncome spring. Somehow she git herself roses and posies and vegetables.\r\n\r\n\"Dere warn't no overseer. Marse Ed, he jes' ride round on he big hoss\r\nand see to things. Us didn't know nothin 'bout de war much, 'cause none\r\nus could read or write.\r\n\r\n\"Dere was two fiddlers 'mongst us, Jim Roseborough and Tom. Dey'd have\r\nde big barbecue for folks come from miles round, and coffee and chicken\r\nand turkey and dancin' and fiddlin' all night. Come daybreak, dey jes'\r\ngoin' good. Us niggers dance back de quarters, and call\r\n\r\n\"'All eight balance and all eight swing,\r\nAll left allemond and right hand grand,\r\nMeet your partner and prom'nade, eight,\r\nDen march till you come straight.\r\n\r\n\"'First lady out to couple on de right,\r\nSwing Mr. Adam and swing Miss Eve,\r\nSwing Old Adam befo' you leave,\r\nDon't forgit your own--now you're home.'\r\n\r\n\"Two, three years after dat I marries Liza Smith. Us has four chillen\r\nand all dead 'cept John, and he lives out west.\r\n\r\n\"After freedom Old Marse say kill a yearlin' and have de big dinner and\r\ndance. De young ones he told to scatter out and hunt work, not to steal\r\nand work hard. Some de oldes' ones he give a cabin and a patch of land.\r\nHe say de niggers what want to stay on and work for him can, iffen he\r\nmake enough to feed dem. I stays with Marse Ed, but he give me a patch\r\nof twenty acres and a sorghum mill to make a livin' on. Dat how I gits\r\non my way after freedom.\r\n\r\n\"I gits dat sorghum mill to workin' good and works de Roseborough land\r\nand my patch, and raises corn and cotton and wheat. I was plumb good at\r\nfarmin'. I allus had a piece or two of money in my pocket since I can\r\n'member, but now de old man's too old. De gov'ment gives me seven or\r\neight dollars a month and I has a few chickens and gits by, and de good\r\nwhite folks nigh by sees dat dis old boy don't git cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420059\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Anne Clark]\r\n\r\n\r\n     MOTHER ANNE CLARK, 112 years old, lives at 3602 Alameda Ave., El\r\n     Paso, Texas. She is too crippled to walk, but a smile lights up the\r\n     tired old eyes that still see to sew without glasses. One tooth of\r\n     a third set is in her upper gum. She is deaf, but can hear if you\r\n     speak close to her ear. She says, \"Lemma git my ears open, bofe of\r\n     'em,\" wets her finger, then pulls so hard on the ear lobes it seems\r\n     they would be injured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'll be 112 years old, come first day of June (1937). Bo'n in\r\nMississippi. I had two marsters, but I've been free nearly 80 years. I\r\nwas freed in Memphis.\r\n\r\n\"My marster was a Yankee. He took me to Louisiana and made a slave outta\r\nme. But he had to go to war. He got in a quarrel one day and grabbed two\r\nsix-shooters, but a old white man got him down and nearly kilt him. Our\r\nmen got him and gave him to the Yankees.\r\n\r\n\"Capt. Clark, my second marster, took a shot at him and he couldn' come\r\nsouth no more. You don' know what a time I seen! I don' wanna see no\r\nmore war. Why, we made the United States rich but the Yankees come and\r\ntuk it. They buried money and when you bury money it goes fu'ther down,\r\ndown, down, and then you cain't fin' it.\r\n\r\n\"You know, the white folks hated to give us up worse thing in the world.\r\nI ploughed, hoed, split rails. I done the hardest work ever a man ever\r\ndid. I was so strong, iffen he needed me I'd pull the men down so the\r\nmarster could handcuff 'em. They'd whop us with a bullwhip. We got up\r\nat 3 o'clock, at 4 we done et and hitched up the mules and went to the\r\nfiel's. We worked all day pullin' fodder and choppin' cotton. Marster'd\r\nsay, 'I wan' you to lead dat fiel' today, and if you don' do it I'll put\r\nyou in de stocks.' Then he'd whop me iffen I didn' know he was talkin'\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n\"My poppa was strong. He never had a lick in his life. He helped the\r\nmarster, but one day the marster says, 'Si, you got to have a whoppin',\r\nand my poppa says, 'I never had a whoppin' and you cain't whop me.' An'\r\nthe marster says, 'But I kin kill you,' an' he shot my poppa down. My\r\nmama tuk him in the cabin and put him on a pallet. He died.\r\n\r\n\"My mama did the washin' for the big house. She tuk a big tub on her\r\nhead and a bucket of water in her hand. My mama had two white chillen by\r\nmarster and they were sold as slaves. I had two chillen, too. I never\r\nmarried. They allus said we'd steal, but I didn' take a thing. Why,\r\nthey'd put me on a hoss with money to take into town and I'd take it to\r\nthe store in town, and when I'd git back, marster'd say, 'Anne, you\r\ndidn' take a thing.'\r\n\r\n\"When women was with child they'd dig a hole in the groun' and put their\r\nstomach in the hole, and then beat 'em.

He ran away in 1861 to join the Union\r\n     Army. He fought at Chickamauga, under Gen. Rosecran and at\r\n     Chattanooga, Look Out Mt. and Orchard Knob, under Gen. Thomas.\r\n     After the war he worked as switchman in Chattanooga until his\r\n     health failed due to old age. He then came to Texas and lives with\r\n     his daughter, in Corsicana. Thomas is blind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I might as well begin far back as I remember and tell you all about\r\nmyself. I was born over in Jackson County, in Alabama, on August 8,\r\n1845. My mother was Elizabeth Cole, her bein' a slave of Robert Cole,\r\nand my father was Alex Gerrand, 'cause he was John Gerrand's slave. I\r\nwas sposed to take my father's name, but he was sech a bad, ornery,\r\nno-count sech a human, I jes' taken my old massa's name. My mother was\r\nbrung from Virginny by Massa Dr. Cole, and she nussed all his six\r\nchillen. My sister's name was Sarah and my brother's name was Ben and we\r\nlived in one room of the big house, and allus had a good bed to sleep in\r\nand good things to eat at the same table, after de white folks gits\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n\"I played with Massa Cole's chillen all de time, and when I got older he\r\nstarted me workin' by totin' wood and sech odd jobs, and feedin' de\r\nhawgs. Us chillen had to pick cotton every fall. De big baskets weigh\r\nabout seventy-five to a hundred pounds, but us chillen put our pickin's\r\nin some growed slave's basket. De growed slaves was jes' like a mule. He\r\nwork for grub and clothes, and some of dem didn't have as easier a time\r\nas a mule, for mules was fed good and slaves was sometimes half\r\nstarved. But Massa Cole was a smart man and a good man with it. He had\r\n'spect for the slaves' feelin's and didn't treat dem like dumb brutes,\r\nand 'lowed dem more privileges dan any other slaveholder round dere. He\r\nwas one of de best men I ever knows in my whole life and his wife was\r\njes' like him. Dey had a big, four-room log house with a big hall down\r\nthe center up and down. De logs was all peeled and de chinkin' a\r\ndiff'rent color from de logs and covered with beads. De kitchen am a\r\none-room house behin' de big house with de big chimney to cook on. Dat\r\nwhere all de meals cooked and carry to de house.\r\n\r\n\"In winter massa allus kill from three to four hundred hawgs, de two\r\nkillin's he done in November and January. Some kill and stick, some\r\nscald and scrape, and some dress dem and cut dem up and render de lard.\r\nDey haul plenty hick'ry wood to de smokehouse and de men works in shifts\r\nto keep de smoke fire goin' sev'ral days, den hangs de meat in de\r\nmeathouse. First us eat all de chitlin's, den massa begin issuin'\r\ncut-back bones to each fam'ly, and den 'long come de spareribs, den de\r\nmiddlin' or a shoulder, and by dat time he kill de second time and dis\r\nwas to go all over 'gain. Each fam'ly git de same kind of meat each\r\nweek. Iffen one git a ham, dey all git a ham. All de ears and feet was\r\npickle and we eats dem, too. If de meat run out 'fore killin' time, us\r\ngit wild turkeys or kill a beef or a goat, or git a deer.\r\n\r\n\"Massa let us plant pumpkins and have a acre or two for watermelons,\r\niffen us work dem on Saturday evenin's. Dere a orchard of 'bout five or\r\nsix acres peaches and apples and he 'low us to have biscuits once a\r\nweek. Yes, we had good eatin' and plenty of it den.\r\n\r\n\"Massa had one big, stout, healthy lookin' slave 'bout six foot, four\r\ninches tall, what he pay $3,000 for. He bought six slaves I knows of and\r\ngive from $400 up for dem. He never sold a slave 'less he git onruly.\r\n\r\n\"Massa allus give us cotton clothes for summer and wool for winter,\r\n'cause he raised cotton and sheep. Den each fam'ly have some chickens\r\nand sell dem and de eggs and maybe go huntin' and sell de hides and git\r\nsome money. Den us buy what am Sunday clothes with dat money, sech as\r\nhats and pants and shoes and dresses.\r\n\r\n\"We'd git up early every day in de year, rain or shine, hot or cold. A\r\nslave blowed de horn and dere no danger of you not wakin' up when dat\r\nblowed long and loud. He climb up on a platform 'bout ten feet tall to\r\nblow dat bugle. We'd work till noon and eat in de shade and rest 'bout a\r\nhour or a little more iffen it hot, but only a hour if it cold. You is\r\nallus tired when you makes de day like dat on de plantation and you\r\ncan't play all night like de young folks does now. But us lucky, 'cause\r\nMassa Cole don't whip us. De man what have a place next ours, he sho'\r\nwhip he slaves. He have de cat-o-nine tails of rawhide leather platted\r\nround a piece of wood for a handle. De wood 'bout ten inches long and de\r\nleather braided on past de stock quite a piece, and 'bout a foot from\r\ndat all de strips tied in a knot and sprangle out, and makes de tassle.\r\nDis am call de cracker and it am what split de hide. Some folks call dem\r\nbullwhips, 'stead of cat-o-nine tails. De first thing dat man do when he\r\nbuy a slave, am give him de whippin'. He call it puttin' de fear of Gawd\r\nin him.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Cola 'low us read de Bible. He awful good 'bout dat. Most de\r\nslaveowners wouldn't 'low no sech. Uncle Dan he read to us and on Sunday\r\nwe could go to church. De preacher baptize de slaves in de river. Dat\r\nde good, old-time 'ligion, and us all go to shoutin' and has a good\r\ntime. Dis gen'ration too dig'fied to have de old-time 'ligion.\r\n\r\n\"When baptizin' comes off, it almost like goin' to de circus. People\r\ncome from all over and dey all singin' songs and everybody take dere\r\nlunch and have de good time. Massa Cole went one time and den he git\r\nsick, and next summer he die. Missy Cole, she moves to Huntsville, in\r\nAlabama. But she leave me on de plantation, 'cause I'm big and stout\r\nden. She takes my mother to cook and dat de last time I ever seed my\r\nmother. Missy Cole buys de fine house in Huntsville my mother tells me\r\nto be good and do all de overseer tells me. I told her goodbye and she\r\nnever did git to come back to see me, and I never seed her and my\r\nbrother and sister 'gain. I don't know whether dey am sold or not.\r\n\r\n\"I thinks to myself, dat Mr. Anderson, de overseer, he'll give me dat\r\ncat-o-nine tails de first chance he gits, but makes up my mind he won't\r\ngit de chance, 'cause I's gwine run off de first chance I gits. I didn't\r\nknow how to git out of dere, but I's gwine north where dere ain't no\r\nslaveowners. In a year or so dere am 'nother overseer, Mr. Sandson, and\r\nhe give me de log house and de gal to do my cookin' and sich. Dere am\r\nwar talk and we 'gins gwine to de field earlier and stayin' later. Corn\r\nam haul off, cotton am haul off, hawgs and cattle am rounded up and haul\r\noff and things 'gins lookin' bad. De war am on, but us don't see none of\r\nit. But 'stead of eatin' cornbread, us eats bread out of kaffir corn and\r\nmaize. \"We raises lots of okra and dey say it gwine be parch\r\nand grind to make coffee for white folks. Dat didn't look good either.\r\nDat winter, 'stead of killin' three or four hundred hawgs like we allus\r\ndone befo', we only done one killin' of a hundred seventy-five, and dey\r\nnot all big ones, neither. When de meat supply runs low, Mr. Sandson\r\nsends some slaves to kill a deer or wild hawgs or jes' any kind of game.\r\nHe never sends me in any dem bunches but I hoped he would and one day he\r\ncalls me to go and says not to go off de plantation too far, but be sho'\r\nbring home some meat. Dis de chance I been wantin', so when we gits to\r\nde huntin' ground de leader says to scatter out, and I tells him me and\r\n'nother man goes north and make de circle round de river and meet 'bout\r\nsundown. I crosses de river and goes north. I's gwine to de free\r\ncountry, where dey ain't no slaves. I travels all dat day and night up\r\nde river and follows de north star. Sev'ral times I thunk de blood\r\nhoun's am trailin' me and I gits in de big hurry. I's so tired I\r\ncouldn't hardly move, but I gits in a trot.\r\n\r\n\"I's hopin' and prayin' all de time I meets up with dat Harriet Tubman\r\nwoman. She de cullud women what takes slaves to Canada. She allus\r\ntravels de underground railroad, dey calls it, travels at night and\r\nhides out in de day. She sho' sneaks dem out de South and I thinks she's\r\nde brave woman.\r\n\r\n\"I eats all de nuts and kills a few swamp rabbits and cotches a few\r\nfish. I builds de fire and goes off 'bout half a mile and hides in de\r\nthicket till it burns down to de coals, den bakes me some fish and\r\nrabbit. I's shakin' all de time, 'fraid I'd git cotched, but I's nearly\r\nstarve to death. I puts de rest de fish in my cap and travels on dat\r\nnight by de north star and hides in a big thicket de nex' day and along\r\nevenin' I hears guns shootin'. I sho' am scart dis time, sho' 'nough.\r\nI's scart to come in and scart to go out, and while I's standin' dere, I\r\nhears two men say, 'Stick you hands up, boy. What you doin?' I says,\r\n'Uh-uh-uh, I dunno. You ain't gwine take me back to de plantation, is\r\nyou?' Dey says, 'No. Does you want to fight for de North?' I says I\r\nwill, 'cause dey talks like northern men. Us walk night and day and gits\r\nin Gen. Rosecran's camp and dey thunk I's de spy from de South. Dey asks\r\nme all sorts of questions and says dey'll whip me if I didn't tell dem\r\nwhat I's spyin' 'bout. Fin'ly dey 'lieves me and puts me to work helpin'\r\nwith de cannons. I feels 'portant den, but I didn't know what was in\r\nfront of me, or I 'spects I'd run off 'gain.\r\n\r\n\"I helps sot dem cannons on dis Chickamauga Mountain, in hidin' places.\r\nI has to go with a man and wait on him and dat cannon. First thing I\r\nknows, bang, bang, boom, things has started, and guns am shootin' faster\r\ndan you can think, and I looks round for de way to run. But dem guns am\r\nshootin' down de hill in front of me and shootin' at me, and over me and\r\non both sides of me. I tries to dig me a hole and git in it. All dis\r\nhappen right now, and first thing I knows, de man am kickin' me and\r\nwantin' me to holp him keep dat cannon loaded. Man, I didn't want no\r\ncannon, but I has to help anyway. We fit till dark and de Rebels got\r\nmore men dan us, so Gen. Rosecran sends de message to Gen. Woods to come\r\nhelp us out. When de messenger slips off, I sho' wish it am me slippin'\r\noff, but I didn't want to see no Gen. Woods. I jes' wants to git back to\r\ndat old plantation and pick more cotton. I'd been willin' to do mos'\r\nanything to git out that mess, but I done told Gen. Rosecran I wants to\r\nfight de Rebels and he sho' was lettin' me do it. He wasn't jes' lettin'\r\nme do it, he was makin' me do it. I done got in dere and he wouldn't let\r\nme out.\r\n\r\n\"White folks, dere was men layin' wantin' help, wantin' water, with\r\nblood runnin' out dem and de top or sides dere heads gone, great big\r\nholes in dem. I jes' promises de good Lawd if he jes' let me git out dat\r\nmess, I wouldn't run off no more, but I didn't know den he wasn't gwine\r\nlet me out with jes' dat battle. He gwine give me plenty more, but dat\r\nbattle ain't over yet, for nex' mornin' de Rebels 'gins shootin' and\r\nkillin' lots of our men, and Gen. Woods ain't come, so Gen. Rosecran\r\norders us to 'treat, and didn't have to tell me what he said, neither.\r\nDe Rebels comes after us, shootin', and we runs off and leaves dat\r\ncannon what I was with settin' on de hill, and I didn't want dat thing\r\nnohow.\r\n\r\n\"We kep' hotfootin' till we gits to Chattanooga and dere is where we\r\nstops. Here comes one dem Rebel generals with de big bunch of men and\r\ngits right on top of Look Out Mountain, right clost to Chattanooga, and\r\nwouldn't let us out. I don't know jes' how long, but a long time. Lots\r\nour hosses and mules starves to death and we eats some de hosses. We all\r\nlike to starve to death ourselves. Chattanooga is in de bend de\r\nTennessee River and on Look Out Mountain, on de east, am dem Rebels and\r\ncould keep up with everything we done. After a long time a Gen. Thomas\r\ngits in some way. He finds de rough trail or wagon road round de\r\nmountain 'long de river and supplies and men comes by boat up de river\r\nto dis place and comes on into Chattanooga. More Union men kep' comin'\r\nand I guess maybe six or eight generals and dey gits ready to fight. It\r\nam long late in Fall or early winter.\r\n\r\n\"Dey starts climbin' dis steep mountain and when us gits three-fourths\r\nde way up it am foggy and you couldn't see no place. Everything wet and\r\nde rocks am slick and dey 'gins fightin'. I 'spect some shoots dere own\r\nmen, 'cause you couldn't see nothin', jes' men runnin' and de guns\r\nroarin'. Fin'ly dem Rebels fled and we gits on Look Out Mountain and\r\ntakes it.\r\n\r\n\"Dere a long range of hills leadin' 'way from Look Out Mountain, nearly\r\nto Missionary Ridge. Dis ridge 'longside de Chickamauga River, what am\r\nde Indian name, meanin' River of Death. Dey fights de Rebels on Orchard\r\nKnob hill and I wasn't in dat, but I's in de Missionary Ridge battle. We\r\nhas to come out de timber and run 'cross a strip or openin' up de hill.\r\nDey sho' kilt lots our men when we runs 'cross dat openin'. We runs for\r\nall we's worth and uses guns or anything we could. De Rebels turns and\r\nruns off and our soldiers turns de cannons round what we's capture, and\r\nkilt some de Rebels with dere own guns.\r\n\r\n\"I never did git to where I wasn't scart when we goes into de battle.\r\nDis de last one I's in and I's sho' glad, for I never seed de like of\r\ndead and wounded men. We picks dem up, de Rebels like de Unions, and\r\ndoctors dem de bes' we could. When I seed all dat sufferin', I hopes I\r\nnever lives to see 'nother war. Dey say de World War am worse but I's\r\ntoo old to go.\r\n\r\n\"I sho' wishes lots of times I never run off from de plantation. I begs\r\nde General not to send me on any more battles, and he says I's de coward\r\nand sympathizes with de South. But I tells him I jes' couldn't stand to\r\nsee all dem men layin' dere dyin' and hollerin' and beggin' for help and\r\na drink of water, and blood everywhere you looks. Killin' hawgs back on\r\nde plantation didn't bother me none, but dis am diff'rent.\r\n\r\n\"Fin'ly de General tells me I can go back to Chattanooga and guard de\r\nsupplies in camp dere and take care de wounded soldiers and prisoners. A\r\nbunch of men is with me and we has all we can do. We gits de orders to\r\nsend supplies to some general and it my job to help load de wagons or\r\nbox cars or boats. A train of wagons leaves sometimes. We gits all dem\r\nsupplies by boat, and Chattanooga am de 'stributing center. When winter\r\ncomes, everybody rests awhile and waits for Spring to open. De Union\r\ngeneral sends in some more cullud soldiers. Dere ain't been many cullud\r\nmen but de las' year de war dere am lots. De North and de South am\r\ntakin' anything dey can git to win de war.\r\n\r\n\"When Spring breaks and all de snow am gone, and de trees 'gins puttin'\r\nout and everything 'gins to look purty and peaceable-like, makin' you\r\nthink you ought to be plowin' and plantin' a crop, dat when de fightin'\r\nstarts all over 'gain, killin' men and burnin' homes and stealin' stock\r\nand food. Den dey sends me out to help clear roads and build temp'rary\r\nbridges. We walks miles on muddy ground, 'cross rivers, wadin' water up\r\nto our chins. We builds rafts and pole bridges to git de mules and\r\nhosses and cannons 'cross, and up and down hills, and cuts roads through\r\ntimber.\r\n\r\n\"But when dey wants to battle Gen. Thomas allus leaves me in camp to\r\ntend de supplies. He calls me a coward, and I sho' glad he thunk I was.\r\nI wasn't no coward, I jes' couldn't stand to see all dem people tore to\r\npieces. I hears 'bout de battle in a thick forest and de trees big as my\r\nbody jes' shot down. I seed dat in de Missionary Ridge battle, too.\r\n\r\n\"I shifts from one camp to 'nother and fin'ly gits back to Chattanooga.\r\nI bet durin' my time I handles 'nough ammunition to kill everybody in de\r\nwhole United States. I seed mos' de mainest generals in de Union Army\r\nand some in de Rebel Army.\r\n\r\n\"After de war am over we's turned loose, nowhere to go and nobody to\r\nhelp us. I couldn't go South, for dey calls me de traitor and sho' kill\r\nme iffen dey knows I fit for de North. I does any little job I can git\r\nfor 'bout a year and fin'ly gits work on de railroad, in Stevenson, in\r\nAlabama. I gits transfer to Chattanooga and works layin' new tracks and\r\nturn tables and sich.\r\n\r\n\"In 'bout two weeks I had saw a gal next door, but I's bashful. But\r\nafter payday I dresses up and takes her to a dance. We sparks 'bout two\r\nmonths and den we's married at her uncles. Her name am Nancy. We buys a\r\npiece of land and I has a two-room house built on it. We has two chillen\r\nand I's livin' with de baby gal now.\r\n\r\n\"I 'lieve de slaves I knowed as a whole was happier and better off after\r\n'mancipation dan befo'. Of course, de first few years it was awful hard\r\nto git 'justed to de new life. All de slaves knowed how to do hard work,\r\nand dat de old slaves life, but dey didn't know nothin' 'bout how to\r\n'pend on demselves for de livin'. My first year was hard, but dere was\r\nplenty wild game in dem days. De south was broke and I didn't hear of no\r\nslaves gittin' anything but to crop on de halves. Dey too glad to be\r\nfree and didn't want nothin'.\r\n\r\n\"Things 'gin to git bad for me in Chattanooga as de white men finds out\r\nI run off from de South and jined de North. Some de brakemen try to git\r\nmy job. I fin'ly quits when one of dem opens a switch I jus' closed. I\r\nseed him and goes back and fixes de switch, but I quits de job. I goes\r\nup north but dey ain't int'rested, so I comes back and sells my home and\r\nbuys me a team and wagon. I loads it with my wife and chillen and a few\r\nthings and starts for Texas. We's on de road 'bout six weeks or two\r\nmonths. We fishes and hunts every day and de trip didn't cost much. I\r\nbuys ninety acres in timber in Cass County and cuts logs for a house and\r\nbuilds a two-room house and log crib. My wife built a stomp lot for de\r\nteam and cow and a rail fence.\r\n\r\n\"We got 'nough land cleared for de small crop, 'bout thirty acres, and\r\nbuilds de barn and sheds outselves. We lived there till de chillen am\r\ngrowed. My wife died of chills and fever and den my boy and I built a\r\nfour-room house of planks from our timber. Den I gits lonesome, 'cause\r\nde chillen gone, and sells de place. I bought it for fifty cents de acre\r\nand sold it for $12.00 de acre.\r\n\r\n\"I buys sixty acres in Henderson County for $15.00 a acre and marries de\r\nsecond time. I didn't care for her like Nancy. All she think 'bout am\r\nraisin' de devil and never wants to work or save anything. She like to\r\nhave broke me down befo' I gits rid of her. I stayed and farmed sev'ral\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\"My son-in-law rents land in Chambers Creek bottom, and he usually gits\r\nhe crop 'fore de flood gits it. We has some hawgs to kill ev'ry winter\r\nand we has our cornmeal and milk and eggs and chickens, so de 'pression\r\nain't starved us yit. We all got might' nigh naked durin' de 'pression.\r\nI feeds de hawgs and chickens night and mornin'. I can't see dem, but I\r\nlikes to listen to dem eatin' and cackle. People don't know how dey's\r\nblessed with good eyes, till dey loses dem. Everybody ought to be more\r\nthankful dan they is.\r\n\r\n\"I ain't never voted in my life. I leans to de 'publicans. I don't know\r\nmuch 'bout politics, though.\r\n\r\n\"Today I is broke, 'cause I spent all my money for med'cine and doctors,\r\nbut I gits a small pension and I spends it mos' careful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420270\r\n\r\n\r\n     ELI COLEMAN, 91, was born a slave of George Brady, in Kentucky.\r\n     Eli's memory is poor and his story is somewhat sketchy. He now\r\n     lives in Madisonville, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I has a old bill of sale, and it shows I's born in 1846 and my massa am\r\nGeorge Brady. I know my pappy's name was same as mine, and mammy was\r\nElla, and I had one brother named Sam, and my sisters was Sadie and Rosa\r\nand Viola. They's all dead now.\r\n\r\n\"Pappy was owned by Massa Coleman, what was brother to Massa Brady.\r\nPappy could only see mammy once a week when he's courtin' for her. I\r\nheard pappy tell 'bout his pappy, over in Africy, and he had near a\r\nhundred wives and over three hundred chillen.\r\n\r\n\"Pappy never did work. All he ever did was trade. He'd make one thing\r\nand 'nother and trade it for something to eat. He could get lots of\r\nfruit and game out of the woods them days, and there was lots of fish.\r\n\r\n\"Our log house was built of logs, trimmed, and had six rooms. It was\r\nlong, like a cowbarn or chicken house, and my room was third. We had one\r\ndoor to each room, covered over with hides. We dug out one corner for\r\nthe bed and fenced it up and gathered straw and moss and tore-up corn\r\nshucks, and put in the corner to sleep on. What I mean, it was a warm\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n\"We did all kinds of work, choppin' cotton and split rails and cut rock,\r\nand work in the tobacco field. We'd cut that tobacco and hang it in the\r\nshed to dry. It had to be hanged by the stubble end.\r\n\r\n\"We had plenty to eat, sech as corn pones. The corn was grated by hand\r\nand cooked in ashes, and no salt or soda or fancy things like they put\r\nin bread now.\r\n\r\n\"There was possum and rabbit and we cooked them different to now. A\r\ngreat big, old pot hung over the old rock fireplace. Food cooked that\r\nway still eats good. Massa Brady allus give us lots out of the garden.\r\nHe fed us reg'lar on good, 'stantial food, jus' like you'd tend to you\r\nhoss, if you had a real good one.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Brady, he was one these jolly fellows and a real good man, allus\r\ngood to his black folks. Missy, she was plumb angel. They lived in a old\r\nstone house with four big rooms. It was the best house in the whole\r\ncounty and lots of shade trees by it.\r\n\r\n\"We had 'bout a hundred acres in our plantation and started to the field\r\n'fore daylight and worked long as we could see, and fed ane stock and\r\ngot to bed 'bout nine o'clock. Massa whopped a slave if he got stubborn\r\nor lazy. He whopped one so hard that slave said he'd kill him. So Massa\r\ndone put a chain round his legs, so he jus' hardly walk, and he has to\r\nwork in the field that way. At night he put 'nother chain round his neck\r\nand fastened it to a tree. After three weeks massa turnt him loose and\r\nthat the proudes' nigger in the world, and the hardes' workin' nigger\r\nmassa had after that.\r\n\r\n\"On Saturday night we could git a pass or have a party on our own place.\r\nThrough the week we'd fall into our quarters and them patterrollers come\r\nwalk all over us, and we'd be plumb still, but after they done gone some\r\nniggers gits up and out.\r\n\r\n\"On Christmas Day massa make a great big eggnog and let us have all we\r\nwants with a big dinner. He kilt a yearlin' and made plenty barbecue for\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"Massa was a colonel in the war and took me along to care for his hoss\r\nand gun. Them guns, you couldn't hear nothin' for them poppin'. Us\r\nniggers had to go all over and pick up them what got kilt. Them what was\r\nhurt we carried back. Them what was too bad hurt we had to carry to the\r\nburying place and the white man'd finish killin' them, so we could roll\r\nthem in the hole.\r\n\r\n\"When massa say we're free, we all 'gun to take on. We didn't have no\r\nplace to go and asked massa could we stay, but he say no. But he did let\r\nsome stay and furnished teams and something to eat and work on the\r\nhalves. I stayed and was sharecropper, and that was when slavery start,\r\nfor when we got our cop made it done take every bit of it to pay our\r\ndebts and we had nothing left to buy winter clothes or pay doctor bills.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout a year after the war I marries Nora Brady, jus' a home weddin'. I\r\nasks her to come live with me as my wife and she 'greed and she jus'\r\nmoved her clothes to my room and we lived together a long time. One\r\nmornin' Nora jus' died, and there warn't no chillen, so I sets out for\r\nTexas. I done hear the railroad is buildin' in Texas and they hires lots\r\nof niggers. I gits a hoss from massa and rolls up a few clothes and gits\r\nmy gun.\r\n\r\n\"I never got very far 'fore the Indians takes my hoss away from me. It\r\nwas 'bout fifty mile to a train and I didn't have no money, but I found\r\na white man what wants wood cut and I works near a month for him and\r\ngits $2.00. I gits on a train and comes a hundred mile from where that\r\nrailroad was goin' 'cross the country, and I has to walk near all that\r\nhundred miles. Once and now a white man comin' or goin' lets me ride.\r\nBut I got there and the job pays me sixty cents a day. That was lots of\r\nmoney them days. Near as I 'member, it was 1867 or 1868 when I comes to\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\n\"Then I marries Agnes Frazer, and we has a big weddin' and a preacher\r\nand a big supper for two or three weeks. Her pappy kilt game and we et\r\nbarbecue all the time. We had eleven chillen, one a year for a long\r\ntime, five boys and six gals. One made a school teacher and I ain't seen\r\nher nearly forty-five years, 'cause she done took a notion to go north\r\nand they won't let her back in Texas 'cause she married a white man in\r\nNew York. I don't like that. She don't have no sense or she wouldn't\r\ndone that, no, sir.\r\n\r\n\"Since the nigger been free it been Hell on the poor old nigger. He has\r\nadvance some ways, but he's still a servant and will be, long as Gawd's\r\ncurse still stay on the Negro race. We was turnt loose without nothin'\r\nand done been under the white man rule so long we couldn't hold no job\r\nbut labor. I worked most two years on that railroad and the rest my life\r\nI farms. Now I gits a little pension from the gov'ment and them white\r\nfolks am sho' good to give it to me, 'cause I ain't good for work no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420003\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Preely Coleman]\r\n\r\n\r\n     PREELY COLEMAN was born in 1852 on the Souba farm, near New Berry,\r\n     South Carolina, but he and his mother were sold and brought to\r\n     Texas when Preely was a month old. They settled near Alto, Texas.\r\n     Preely now lives in Tyler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'm Preely Coleman and I never gits tired of talking. Yes, ma'am, it am\r\nJuneteenth, but I'm home, 'cause I'm too old now to go on them\r\ncelerabrations. Where was I born? I knows that 'zactly, 'cause my mammy\r\ntells me that a thousand times. I was born down on the old Souba place,\r\nin South Carolina, 'bout ten mile from New Berry. My mammy belonged to\r\nthe Souba family, but its a fact one of the Souba boys was my pappy and\r\nso the Soubas sells my mammy to Bob and Dan Lewis and they brung us to\r\nTexas 'long with a big bunch of other slaves. Mammy tells me it was a\r\nfull month 'fore they gits to Alto, their new home.\r\n\r\n\"When I was a chile I has a purty good time, 'cause there was plenty\r\nchillen on the plantation. We had the big races. Durin' the war the\r\nsojers stops by on the way to Mansfield, in Louisiana, to git somethin'\r\nto eat and stay all night, and then's when we had the races. There was a\r\nmulberry tree we'd run to and we'd line up and the sojers would say,\r\n'Now the first one to slap that tree gits a quarter,' and I nearly allus\r\ngits there first. I made plenty quarters slappin' that old mulberry\r\ntree!\r\n\r\n\"So the chillen gits into their heads to fix me, 'cause I wins all the\r\nquarters. They throws a rope over my head and started draggin down the\r\nroad, and down the hill, and I was nigh 'bout choked to death. My only\r\nfriend was Billy and he was a-fightin', tryin' to git me loose. They was\r\ngoin' to throw me in the big spring at the foot of that hill, but we\r\nmeets Capt. Berryman, a white man, and he took his knife and cut the\r\nrope from my neck and took me by the heels and soused me up and down in\r\nthe spring till I come to. They never tries to kill me any more.\r\n\r\n\"My mammy done married John Selman on the way to Texas, no cere'mony,\r\nyou knows, but with her massa's consent. Now our masters, the Lewises,\r\nthey loses their place and then the Selman's buy me and mammy. They pays\r\n$1,500 for my mammy and I was throwed in.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Selman has five cabins in he backyard and they's built like half\r\ncircle. I grows big 'nough to hoe and den to plow. We has to be ready\r\nfor the field by daylight and the conk was blowed, and massa call out,\r\n'All hands ready for the field.' At 11:30 he blows the conk, what am the\r\nmussel shell, you knows, 'gain and we eats dinner, and at 12:30 we has\r\nto be back at work. But massa wouldn't 'low no kind of work on Sunday.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Tom made us wear the shoes, 'cause they's so many snags and\r\nstumps our feets gits sore, and they was red russet shoes. I'll never\r\nforgit 'em, they was so stiff at first we could hardly stand 'em. But\r\nMassa Tom was a good man, though he did love he dram. He kep' the bottle\r\nin the center of the dining table all the time and every meal he'd have\r\nthe toddy. Us slaves et out under the trees in summer and in the kitchen\r\nin winter and most gen'rally we has bread in pot liquor or milk, but\r\nsometimes honey.\r\n\r\n\"I well 'members when freedom come. We was in the field and massa comes\r\nup and say, 'You all is free as I is.' There was shoutin' and singin'\r\nand 'fore night us was all 'way to freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420292\r\n\r\n\r\n     HARRIET COLLINS was born in Houston, Texas, in 1870. Her family had\r\n     been slaves of Richard Coke, and remained with him many years after\r\n     they were freed. Harriet recalls some incidents of Reconstruction\r\n     days, and believes in the superstitions handed down to her from\r\n     slave days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My birthday done come in January, on de tenth. I's birthed in Houston,\r\nin 1870, and Gov. Richard Coke allus had owned my daddy and mammy, and\r\ndey stayed with him after freedom. Mammy, what was Julia Collins, didn't\r\ndie till 1910, and she was most a hundred year old.\r\n\r\n\"She done told me many a time 'bout how folkses git all worked up over\r\nMarse Coke's 'lection. Mammy took lunch to de Capitol House to Marse\r\nRichard, and dere he am on de top floor with all he congressmen and dat\r\nDavis man and he men on de bottom floor, tryin' to say Marse Richard\r\nain't got no right to be governor dis here State. Old Miss and de\r\nfolkses didn't sleep a wink dat night, 'cause dey thunk it sho' be a\r\nfight. Dat in 1873, Mammy allus say.\r\n\r\n\"De old place at Houston was like most all old places. Dere was little,\r\nsmall dormer windows, dey call 'em, in upstairs, and big porches\r\neverywhere. Dere was 'hogany furniture and rosewood bedsteads, and big,\r\nblack walnut dressers with big mirrors and little ones down de side. Old\r\nMiss allus have us keep de drapes white as drifted snow, and polish de\r\nfurniture till it shine. Dere was sofies with dem claw foots, and lots\r\nof purty chiny and silver.\r\n\r\n\"On de farm out from town dere was de log house, with quarters and de\r\nsmokehouse and washhouse and big barns and carriage house. De quarters\r\nwas little, whitewashed, log houses, one for de family, and a fence of\r\nde split palin's round most of dem.\r\n\r\n\"De white and cullud chillen played together, all over de place. Dey\r\nwent fishin' and rode de plough hosses and run de calves and colts and\r\nsech devilment. De little white gals all had to wear sunbonnets, and Old\r\nMiss, she sew dem bonnets on every day, so dey not git sunburnt. Us\r\nniggers weared de long, duckin' shirts till us git 'bout growed, and den\r\nus weared long, dark blue dresses. Dey had spinnin' and weavin' rooms,\r\nwhere de cullud women makes de clothes.\r\n\r\n\"Old Miss, she sho' a powerful manager. She knowed jes' how much meal\r\nand meat and sorghum it gwine take to run de plantation a year. She know\r\njes' how much thread it take for spinnin', and she bossed de settin'\r\nhens and turkeys and fixin' of 'serves and soap. She was sho' good to\r\nyou iffen you work and do like she tell you. Many a night she go round\r\nto see dat all was right. She a powerful good nuss, too, and so was\r\nmammy.\r\n\r\n\"De white folks had good times. Dey'd go hossback ridin' and on picnics,\r\nand fishin' and have big dinners and balls. Come Christmas, dey have us\r\nslaves cut a big lot of wood and keep fires all night for a week or two.\r\nDe house be lit with candles from top to toe, and lots of company come.\r\nFor dinner us have turkey and beef roast and a big 'ginny ham and big\r\nbowls of eggnog and a pitcher of apple cider and apple toddy. All us git\r\nsomethin' on Christmas and plenty eggnog, but no gittin' drunk.\r\n\r\n\"I can jes' see Marse Dick, tall and kinder stooped like, with de big\r\nflop hat and longtail coat and allus carryin' a big, old walkin' stick.\r\nHe was sho' a brave man and de big men say dey likes dat flop hat,\r\n'cause dey done follow it on de battlefield. He had a big voice and dey\r\ndo tell how, in de war, he'd holler, 'Come on, boys,' and de bullets be\r\nlike hail and men fallin' all round, but dat don't stop Marse Dick. He'd\r\ntake off dat flop hat and plunge right on and dey'd foller he bald head\r\nwhere de fight was hottes'. He was sho' a man!\r\n\r\n\"When I gits married it was eight folkses dere, I jus' walks off and\r\ngoes to housekeepin'. I had a calico dress and a Baptist preacher\r\nmarries us.\r\n\r\n\"Dere been some queer things white folks can't understand. Dere am\r\nfolkses can see de spirits, but I can't. My mammy larned me a lots of\r\ndoctorin', what she larnt from old folkses from Africy, and some de\r\nIndians larnt her. If you has rheumatism, jes' take white sassafras root\r\nand bile it and drink de tea. You makes lin'ment by bilin' mullein\r\nflowers and poke roots and alum and salt. Put red pepper in you shoes\r\nand keep de chills off, or string briars round de neck. Make red or\r\nblack snakeroot tea to cure fever and malaria, but git de roots in de\r\nspring when de sap am high.\r\n\r\n\"When chillen teethin' put rattlesnake rattles round de neck, and\r\nalligator teeth am good, too. Show de new moon money and you'll have\r\nmoney all month. Throw her five kisses and show her money and make five\r\nwishes and you'll git dem. Eat black-eyed peas on New Year and have luck\r\nall dat year:\r\n\r\n\"'Dose black-eyed peas is lucky,\r\nWhen et on New Year's Day;\r\nYou'll allus have sweet 'taters\r\nAnd possum come you way.'\r\n\r\n\"When anybody git cut I allus burns woolen rags and smokes de wound or\r\nburns a piece fat pine and drops tar from it on scorched wool and bind\r\nit on de wound. For headache put a horseradish poultice on de head, or\r\nwear a nutmeg on a string round you neck.\r\n\r\nIf you kills de first snake you sees in spring, you enemies ain't gwine\r\ngit de best of you dat year. For a sprain, git a dirt dauber's nest and\r\nput de clay with vinegar and bind round de sprain. De dime on de string\r\nround my ankle keeps cramps out my leg, and tea from red coon-root good,\r\ntoo. All dese doctorin' things come clear from Africy, and dey allus\r\nworked for mammy and for me, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420187\r\n\r\n\r\n     ANDREW (Smoky) COLUMBUS was born in 1859 on the John J. Ellington\r\n     plantation, one mile south of Linden, Texas. He continued in the\r\n     service of the Ellingtons until about 1878, when he moved to\r\n     Jefferson, Texas. He carried meals to Abe Rothchild, who was in\r\n     jail, charged with the murder of Diamond Bessie Moore. Andrew was\r\n     37 years a servant of Hon. Tom Armistead, and was a porter in the\r\n     Capital at Austin when Armistead was a senator. Andrew now lives in\r\n     Marshall, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was bo'n a slave of Master John Ellington, who lived in Davis County\r\n(now Cass Co.), Texas. Master John had a big house and close by was a\r\nlong, double row of slave quarters. It looked like a town. There was\r\nfour boys and two girls in Master's fam'ly and one daughter, Miss Lula,\r\nmarried Lon Morris, that run the Lon Morris School.\r\n\r\n\"Master John was one white man that sho' took care of his niggers. He\r\ngive us plenty warm clothes and good shoes, and come see us and had Dr.\r\nHume doctor us when we was sick. The niggers et ham and middlin' and\r\ngood eats as anybody. Master John's place joined the Haggard place,\r\nwhere they was lots of wild turkey and the slaves could go huntin' and\r\nfishin' when they wanted.\r\n\r\n\"We had a church and a school for the slaves and the white folks helped\r\nus git book learnin'. Mos' of the niggers allus went to preachin' on\r\nSunday.\r\n\r\n\"The hands didn't work Saturday afternoons. That's when we'd wash our\r\nclothes and clean up for Sunday. There was parties and dances on\r\nSaturday night for them as wanted them. But there wasn't no whiskey\r\ndrinkin' and fightin' at the parties. Mammy didn't go to them. She was\r\nreligious and didn't believe in dancin' and sech like. On Christmas\r\nMaster John allus give the slaves a big dinner and it didn't seem like\r\nslavery time. The niggers had a sight better time than they do now.\r\n\r\n\"Master John did all the bossin' hisself. None of his niggers ever run\r\noff 'cause he was too good for them to do that. I only got one whippin'\r\nfrom him and it was for stealin' eggs from a hen's nest. My pappy was\r\ncarriage driver for Master. I didn't do much of the work when I was a\r\nboy, jes' stayed round the house.\r\n\r\n\"Master John raised lots of cotton and after it was baled he hauled it\r\nto Jefferson on ox wagons. I'd allus go with him, ridin' on top of the\r\nbales. I'll never forgit how scared I was when we'd cross Black Cypress\r\non Roger's Ferryboat and it'd begin to rock.\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember much about the War. When it was over Master John calls\r\nall his slaves together and says, 'You'se free now and you can go or\r\nstay.' He told the men who wanted to leave they could have a wagon and\r\nteam, but most of them stayed. Pappy took a wagon and team and left but\r\nmammy and us children stayed and lived with Master Ellington 'bout 15\r\nyears after the war was over.\r\n\r\n\"When I left Master John I moved to Jefferson and married Cora Benton\r\nand we had three boys and two girls. While I was in Jefferson Sheriff\r\nVine goes to Cincinnati after Abe Rothchild, for killin' 'Diamond\r\nBessie.' Abe shot hisself in the forehead when he heared Sheriff Vine\r\nwas after him, but it didn't kill him. There was sho' some stirrin'\r\nabout when the sheriff fotch Abe back to Jefferson.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sam Brown was the jailer. Abe wouldn't eat the jail food and hired\r\nme to bring his meals to him from the hotel. His cell was fixed up like\r\na hotel room, with a fine brussels rug and nice tables and chairs. He\r\nkep' plenty of whiskey and beer to drink. He'd allus give me a drink\r\nwhen I took his meals.\r\n\r\n\"I worked 37 years for Mr. Tom Armistead, who helped W.T. Crawford and\r\nhis brother defend Rothchild. Mr. Eppenstadt, he was mayor of Jefferson\r\nthen and acted as a go-between man in the case.\r\n\r\n\"Master Tom Armistead never married and I kep' house and cooked for him.\r\nHe give me lots of fine clothes. I bet I owned more fine shirts than any\r\nnigger in Texas. He got me a job as porter in the Capitol at Austin\r\nwhile he was senator. I was workin' there when they moved in the new\r\nCapitol in 1888. They was gonna put on a big party and say all the\r\nporters had to wear cutaway suits. I didn't have one, so the day 'fore\r\nthe party I goes over to Mr. Tom's room at the Bristol Hotel and git one\r\nof his. I didn't know then it was a right new one he had made for the\r\nparty. When I goes back to the Capitol all dressed up in that cutaway\r\nsuit, I meets Mr. Templeton Houston and he recognises the suit and says.\r\n'You sho' look fine in Mr. Tom's new suit,' 'bout that time Mr. Tom\r\nwalks up and, you know, he give me that suit and had him another one\r\nmade for the party! I wouldn't live where there wasn't no good white\r\nfolks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420218\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steve Conally]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steve Conally's House]\r\n\r\n\r\n     STEVE CONNALLY, 90, was born a slave of Tom Connally, grandfather\r\n     of United States Senator Tom Connally, from Texas.

All de 'portant men come and all de\r\nsassiety belles jes' drift to our place. Dere sho' lots of big balls and\r\ndinners and de house fix mighty fine dem times. De women wore de hoop\r\nskirts and de ribbons and laces. My missy was de bes' lookin' from far\r\nand near, and all de gem'mans want to dance with her. She sho' look like\r\nde queen you see in de picture books and she have mighty high ways with\r\nfolks, but she's mighty good to dis here li'l black boy.\r\n\r\n\"I goes in de buggy with Massa Cushi, up to Tennessee, to git his sons\r\nwhat been kilt or wounded. Massa Ned, he dead, and Massa Charles, he\r\nshot in de hip, and die after he git brung home. Massa Dick hurt, too,\r\nbut he didn't die.\r\n\r\n\"Right after de Civil War, when I'm 'bout nineteen, I comes to Texas\r\nwith de Connallys, all what didn't git kilt in de war. I stays with\r\nMissy Mary till she die in Georgia. Her son, Jones Connally, come to\r\nBrazos County, near Bryan, and after dat removes to Eddy. I works for\r\nhim two years and has lived round Eddy ever since. De Connallys give me\r\na house and lot in Eddy. Some de fool niggers 'spected a lot, but I\r\nwasn't worryin' none. All I wanted was to stay near de Connallys. Mos'\r\ngen'ly all de slaves what I knowed was found places for and holp git a\r\nstart at jobs and places to live. All de Connally slaves loved dem. Some\r\nde timber land give to Mrs. Rose Staten and when she go up dere a old\r\nnigger woman name Lucy sees her. She so happy to see one dem Connally\r\nchillen she laugh and cry.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Jones Connally have de twin gals, name Ola and Ella. Olla born\r\nwith de lef' arm off at de elbow and she allus follow me round. When I\r\ngo to milk I puts her in de trough. I saved her life lots of times. One\r\ntime she's on de conb of de two-story house, when she's 'bout two years\r\nold. I eases up and knocks de window out and coaxes her to come to me.\r\n'Nother time, I's diggin' de well and some clods falls down and I looks\r\nup and dere am dat Missy Ola leanin' over, mos' tumblin' in de well on\r\nher head. I gives de loud yell and her brother-in-law come runnin' and\r\ngrabs her legs.\r\n\r\n\"Senator Tom Connally, what am a son of Jones Connally, often says he'd\r\nlike to visit his grandpa's old home in Georgia. I'd like mighty well to\r\ngo with him and take him all over de old home place and out to de old\r\ncemetary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420079\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Valmar Cormier]\r\n\r\n\r\n     VALMAR CORMIER was born a slave to Duplissent Dugat, a small\r\n     slave-holder of Lafayette, Louisiana.

My father was a\r\nwhite man, a white Creole man. I never carry he name till after freedom.\r\n\r\n\"Marster was jes' a poor man and he have jes' a ordinary house. De slave\r\nhouse was jes' a old plank house 'bout twelve feet by twenty feet and\r\nhave dirt floor. Us cook in de big fireplace and take a log 'bout four\r\nfoot long and have a big iron pot with a iron lid. Dey put red hot coals\r\nunder de pot and on top de lid and dey have a big iron poker with a hook\r\non it what dey took de lid off with.\r\n\r\n\"Befo' dey have coal oil lamp dey used to use homemake candles. Dey'd\r\nkill de brutes and keep and save all de tallow and one day was set off\r\nto make de candles. All de neighbors come and dey have kind of party and\r\neat and things. Sometime dey make three, four hunnerd candles in one day\r\nand lay dem in a big box, so dey won't git break.\r\n\r\n\"Us make soap on de plantation, too. Dey melt de tallow and cracklin's\r\nand git lye out de fireplace ash. We have cotton and corn and potatoes\r\ngrowin', so we has plenty to eat. Us have coosh-coosh, dat cornbread and\r\nmeat, and some fish to eat. Snails us jes' go through de woods and pick\r\ndem up and eat dem jes' like dat. Us eat plenty crawfish. De chillen git\r\nstring and old piece fat meat and tie on de end, and us go to de bog and\r\ndrap de string down dat crawfish hole. When de old man grab de meat with\r\nhe pincher, den us jerk us up a crawfish, and bile him in hot water, or\r\nmake de gumbo.\r\n\r\n\"Us drink French coffee befo' de war, but endurin' de war us couldn't\r\ngit de good kind. Den us make coffee out of coffee weed. Dey parch dat\r\nweed in de iron oven, grind it and put it in de iron pot.\r\n\r\n\"I seed de sojers and I run under de house, I was so scared. Mary, she\r\nhide under de bed in de house. De Yankees come take de cattle and went\r\n'way with dem. I kin sho' rec'lect when dose sojers come and de road was\r\nfull goin' day and night.

She lives at\r\n     2915 Nance St., Houston, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Lawd have mercy 'pon me, when you calls me Aunt Laura it seems jes'\r\nlike you must be some of my white folks, 'cause dat what dey calls me. I\r\nmean Papa Day's chillen and dere younguns, when dey comes to see me. But\r\nit been de long time since any of dem come to see old Aunt Laura, and I\r\nreckon dey most all gone now.\r\n\r\n\"You know where Dayton is at? Well, dat's where Papa Day's plantation\r\nwas at and where I's borned. I don't know when dat am, 'zactly, but when\r\nall de cullud folks was made free, I reckons I's 'bout twelve or\r\nthirteen years old.\r\n\r\n\"Mama's name was Maria Dunlap and daddy's name was Saul. Mamma was de\r\nseamstress and don't do nothin' but weave cloth on de spinnin' wheel and\r\nmake clothes. Daddy from Lake Providence, I heared him say, but I don't\r\nknow where at dat is. He do all de carpenter work. I has five sisters\r\nand two brothers, but dey heaps older dan me and I don't know much 'bout\r\ndem.\r\n\r\n\"We 'longs to Papa Day, his name Isaiah, but us all call him Papa Day,\r\n'cause he won't 'low none he cullud folks to call him master. He say us\r\nis born free as he is, only de other white folks won't tell us so, and\r\nour souls is jes' as white, and de reason us am darker on de outside is\r\n'cause us is sunburnt. I don't reckon dere am anybody as good to dere\r\ncullud folks as he was.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Martha, he wife, was mighty good, too. Does any us chillen git\r\nhurt or scratched, she fix us up and give us a hug. I knows dey has two\r\nboys and a gal, and dey comes to see me long time after I's free and\r\nbrings dere own chillen. But my mem'ry am sort of foggy-like and I can't\r\n'member dere names now.\r\n\r\n\"De only work Papa Day 'lows us chillen do am pick de boles close to de\r\nground, and dat mostly fun, and us ride to de house on de wagon what\r\ntakes de pickin' at night. Papa Day don't make he cullud folks work\r\nSaturdays and Sundays and dey can visit round on other plantations, and\r\nhe say nobody better bother us none, either.\r\n\r\n\"One time us chillen playin' out in de woods and seed two old men what\r\nlook like wild men, sho' 'nough. Dey has long hair all over de face and\r\ndere shirts all bloody. Us run and tell Papa Day and he makes us take\r\nhim dere and he goes in de briar patch where dem men hidin'. Dey takes\r\nhim round de knees and begs him do he not tell dere massa where dey at,\r\n'cause dey maybe git kilt. Dey say dey am old Lodge and Baldo and dey\r\nrun 'way 'cause dere massa whips dem, 'cause dey so old dey can't work\r\ngood no more. Papa Day has tears comin' in he eyes. Dey can't hardly\r\nwalk, so he sends dem to de house and has Aunt Mandy, de cook, fix up\r\nsomethin' to eat quick. I never seed sech eatin', dey so hongry. He puts\r\ndem in a house and tells us not to say nothin'. Den he rides off on he\r\nhoss and goes to dere massa and tells him 'bout it, and jes' dares him\r\nto come git dem. He pays de man some money and Lodge and Baldo stays\r\nwith Papa Day and I guess day thunk dey in Heaven.\r\n\r\n\"One mornin' Papa Day calls all us to de house and reads de freedom\r\npapers and say, 'De gov'ment don't need to tell you you is free, 'cause\r\nyou been free all you days. If you wants to stay you can and if you\r\nwants to go, you can. But if you go, lots of white folks ain't gwine\r\ntreat you like I does.'\r\n\r\n\"For de longest time, maybe two years, dey wasn't none of Papa Day's\r\ncullud folks what left, but den first one fam'ly den 'nother gits some\r\nland to make a crop on, and den daddy gits some land and us leaves, too.\r\nMaybe he gits de land from Papa Day, 'cause it an't far from his\r\nplantation. Us sho' work hard on dat place, but I heared mama say lots\r\nof times she wishes we stay on Papa Day's place.\r\n\r\n\"I 'member one year us don't make no crop hardly and daddy say he gwine\r\ngit out 'fore us starves to death, and he moves to Houston. He gits a\r\njob doin' carpenter work and hires me out for de housegirl. But mama\r\ndies and daddy takes sick and dies, too. Lawd have mercy, dat sho' de\r\nhard time for me when I loses my mama and daddy, and I has to go to\r\nDayton and stay with my sister, Rachel. Both my husbands what I marries\r\ndone been dead a long time now, and de only child I ever had died when\r\nhe jes' a baby. Now I's jes' alone, sittin' and waitin' for de Lawd to\r\ncall me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420260\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Crawford]\r\n\r\n\r\n     JOHN CRAWFORD, 81, was born a slave on Judge Thompson Rector's\r\n     plantation at Manor, Texas. After emancipation, John was a\r\n     share-cropper. He has always lived in Travis County and is now\r\n     cared for by a daughter at Austin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"John Crawford am me. It am eighty-one years since I's borned and dat's\r\non de old Rector plantation where Manor am now. It wasn't dere den. I\r\nknowed the man it was named after.\r\n\r\n\"Ma's name was Viney Rector and the old judge brung her from Alabama.\r\nShe milked all the cows two times a day and I had to turn out all de\r\ncalves. Sometimes dey'd git purty rough and go right to dere mammies.\r\n\r\n\"Pap's name was Tom Townes, 'cause he 'longed on de Townes place. He was\r\nmy step-pap and when I's growed I tooken my own pap's name, what was\r\nCrawford. I never seed him, though, and didn't know nothin' much 'bout\r\nhim. He's sold away 'fore I's borned.\r\n\r\n\"Pap Townes could make most everythin'. He made turnin' plows and\r\nhossshoe nails and a good lot of furniture. He was purty good to me,\r\n'siderin' he wasn't my own pap. I didn't have no hard time, noway. I had\r\nplenty bacon and side-meat and 'lasses. Every Sunday mornin' the jedge\r\ngive us our rations for de week. He wasn't short with dem, neither.\r\n\r\n\"Many was de time Injuns come to Jedge Rector's place. Dem Injuns beg\r\nfor somethin' and the jedge allus give dem somethin'. They wasn't mean\r\nInjuns, jes' allus beggin'.\r\n\r\n\"I can't read and write to this day. Nobody ever larnt me my A B C's and\r\nI didn't git no chance at school.\r\n\r\n\"On Christmas mornin' Massa Rector come out and give each man and woman\r\na big, red pocket handkerchief and a bottle of liquor. He buyed dat\r\nliquor by de barrel and liked it hisself. Dat why he allus had it on de\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\"One mornin' the jedge done send word down by de cook for nobody to go\r\nto de fields dat day. We all want up to de big house and de jedge git up\r\nto make de speech, but am too choke up to talk. He hated to lose he\r\nslaves, I reckon. So his son-in-law has to say, 'You folks am now free\r\nand can go where you wants to go. You can stay here and pick cotton and\r\ngit fifty cents de hunerd.' But only two families stayed. De rest pulled\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\"After freedom we rented land on de halves. Some niggers soon got ahead\r\nand rented on de third or fourth. When you rent that-a-way you git three\r\nbales and de boss git one. But you has to buy you own teams and seed and\r\nall on dat plan.\r\n\r\n\"Its a fac' we was told we'd git forty acres and a mule. Dat de talk\r\nden, but we never did git it.\r\n\r\n\"De Ku Klux made a lot of devilment round-about dat county. Dey allus\r\nchasin' some nigger and beatin' him up. But some dem niggers sho' 'serve\r\nit. When dey gits free, dey gits wild. Dey won't work or do nothin' and\r\nthinks dey don't have to. We didn't have no trouble, 'cause we stays on\r\nde farm and works and don't have no truck with dem wild niggers.\r\n\r\n\"In 1877 I marries Fannie Black at de town of Sprinkle. It wasn't sech a\r\ntown, jes' a li'l place. Me and her stayed married fifty-two years and\r\nfour months. She died and left me eight year ago. We had seven chillen\r\nand they is all livin'. Four is here in Austin and two in California and\r\none in Ohio.\r\n\r\n\"I gits a li'l pension, $9.00 de month, and my gal, Susie, takes care of\r\nme.

Cumby family, in\r\n     Henderson, Texas. He was about 14 at the close of the Civil War. He\r\n     stayed with his old master four years after he was freed, then\r\n     married and settled in Tyler, Texas, where he worked for the\r\n     compress 30 years. He lives with his daughter at 749 Mesquite St.,\r\n     Abilene, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Durin' slavery I had purty rough times. My grandfather, Tater Cumby,\r\nwas cullud overseer for forty slaves and he called us at four in de\r\nmornin' and we worked from sun to sun. Most of de time we worked on\r\nSunday, too.\r\n\r\n\"De white overseers whupped us with straps when we didn't do right. I\r\nseed niggers in chains lots of times, 'cause there wasn't no jails and\r\nthey jus' chained 'em to trees.\r\n\r\n\"Spec'lators on hosses drove big bunches of slaves past our place from\r\none place to another, to auction 'em at de market places. De women would\r\nbe carryin' l'il ones in dere arms and at night dey bed 'em down jus'\r\nlike cattle right on de ground 'side of de road. Lots of l'il chillun\r\nwas sold 'way from de mammy when dey seven or eight, or even smaller.\r\nDat's why us cullud folks don't know our kinfolks to dis day.\r\n\r\n\"De best times was when de corn shuckin' was at hand. Den you didn't\r\nhave to bother with no pass to leave de plantation, and de patter rolls\r\ndidn't bother you. If de patter rolls cotch you without de pass any\r\nother time, you better wish you dead, 'cause you would have yourself\r\nsome trouble.\r\n\r\n\"But de corn shuckin', dat was de gran' times. All de marsters and dere\r\nblack boys from plantations from miles 'round would be dere. Den when we\r\ngot de corn pile high as dis house, de table was spread out under de\r\nshade. All de boys dat 'long to old marster would take him on de\r\npacksaddle 'round de house, den dey bring him to de table and sit by he\r\nside; den all de boys dat 'long to Marster Bevan from another plantation\r\ntake him on de packsaddle 'round and 'round de house, allus singin' and\r\ndancin', den dey puts him at de other side de table, and dey all do de\r\nsame till everybody at de table, den dey have de feast.\r\n\r\n\"To see de runaway slaves in de woods scared me to death. They'd try to\r\nsnatch you and hold you, so you couldn't go tell. Sometimes dey cotched\r\ndem runaway niggers and dey be like wild animals and have to be tamed\r\nover 'gain. Dere was a white man call Henderson had 60 bloodhounds and\r\nrents 'em out to run slaves. I well rec'lect de hounds run through our\r\nplace one night, chasin' de slave what kilt his wife by runnin' de\r\nharness needle through her heart. Dey cotch him and de patter rolls took\r\nhim to Henderson and hangs him.\r\n\r\n\"De patter rolls dey chases me plenty times, but I's lucky, 'cause dey\r\nnever cotched me. I slips off to see de gal on de nex' plantation and I\r\nhas no pass and they chases me and was I scairt! You should have seed me\r\nrun through dat bresh, 'cause I didn't dare go out on de road or de\r\npath. It near tore de clothes off me, but I goes on and gits home and\r\nslides under de house. But I'd go to see dat gal every time, patter\r\nrolls or no patter rolls, and I gits trained so's I could run 'most as\r\nfast as a rabbit.\r\n\r\n\"De white chillun larned us to read and write at night, but I never paid\r\nmuch 'tention, but I kin read de testament now. Other times at night de\r\nslaves gathers round de cabins in little bunches and talks till bedtime.\r\nSometimes we'd dance and someone would knock out time for us by snappin'\r\nde fingers and slappin' de knee. We didn't have nothin' to make de music\r\non.\r\n\r\n\"We mos'ly lived on corn pone and salt bacon de marster give us. We\r\ndidn't have no gardens ourselves, 'cause we wouldn't have time to work\r\nin dem. We worked all day in de fields and den was so tired we couldn't\r\ndo nothin' more.\r\n\r\n\"My mammy doctored us when we was feelin' bad and she'd take dog-fenley,\r\na yaller lookin' weed, and brew tea, and it driv de chills and de fever\r\nout of us. Sometimes she put horse mint on de pallet with us to make us\r\nsweat and driv de fever 'way. For breakfast she'd make us sass' fras\r\ntea, to clear our blood.\r\n\r\n\"My marstar and his two step-sons goes to de war. De marster was a big\r\ngen'ral on de southern side. I didn't know what dey fightin' 'bout for a\r\nlong time, den I heered it 'bout freedom and I felt like it be Heaven\r\nhere on earth to git freedom, 'spite de fac' I allus had de good\r\nmarster. He sho' was good to us, but you knows dat ain't de same as\r\nbein' free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420124\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tempie Cummins]\r\n\r\n\r\n     TEMPIE CUMMINS was born at Brookeland, Texas, sometime before the\r\n     Civil War, but does not know her exact age.

She now lives alone in a small,\r\n     weather-beaten shack in the South Quarters, a section of Jasper,\r\n     Tex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They call me Tempie Cummins and I was born at Brookeland but I don'\r\nknow jus' the 'xact date. My father's name was Jim Starkins and my\r\nmother's name was Charlotte Brooks and both of 'em come from Alabama. I\r\nhad jus' one brudder, Bill, and four sisters named Margaret and Hannah\r\nand Mary and 'Liza. Life was good when I was with them and us play\r\nround. Miss Fannie Neyland, she Mis' Phil Scarborough now, she raise me,\r\n'cause I was give to them when I was eight year old.\r\n\r\n\"I slep' on a pallet on the floor. They give me a homespun dress onct a\r\nyear at Christmas time. When company come I had to run and slip on that\r\ndress. At other time I wore white chillens' cast-off clothes so wore\r\nthey was ready to throw away. I had to pin them up with red horse thorns\r\nto hide my nakedness. My dress was usually split from hem to neck and I\r\nhad to wear them till they was strings. Went barefoot summer and winter\r\ntill the feets crack open.\r\n\r\n\"I never seed my grandparents 'cause my mother she sold in Alabama when\r\nshe's 17 and they brung her to Texas and treat her rough. At mealtime\r\nthey hand me a piece of cornbread and tell me 'Run 'long.' Sometime I\r\ngit little piece of meat and biscuit, 'bout onct a month. I gathered up\r\nscraps the white chillens lef'.\r\n\r\n\"Marster was rough. He take two beech switches and twist them together\r\nand whip 'em to a stub. Many's the time I's bled from them whippin's.\r\nOur old mistus, she try to be good to us, I reckon, but she was turrible\r\nlazy. She had two of us to wait on her and then she didn' treat us good.\r\n\r\n\"Marster had 30 or 40 acres and he raise cotton, and corn and 'tatoes.\r\nHe used to raise 12 bales cotton a year and then drink it all up. We\r\nwork from daylight till dark, and after. Marster punish them what didn'\r\nwork hard enough.\r\n\r\n\"The white chillen tries teach me to read and write but I didn' larn\r\nmuch, 'cause I allus workin'. Mother was workin' in the house, and she\r\ncooked too. She say she used to hide in the chimney corner and listen to\r\nwhat the white folks say. When freedom was 'clared, marster wouldn' tell\r\n'em, but mother she hear him tellin' mistus that the slaves was free but\r\nthey didn' know it and he's not gwineter tell 'em till he makes another\r\ncrop or two. When mother hear that she say she slip out the chimney\r\ncorner and crack her heels together four times and shouts, 'I's free,\r\nI's free.' Then she runs to the field, 'gainst marster's will and tol'\r\nall the other slaves and they quit work. Then she run away and in the\r\nnight she slip into a big ravine near the house and have them bring me\r\nto her. Marster, he come out with his gun and shot at mother but she run\r\ndown the ravine and gits away with me.\r\n\r\n\"I seed lots of ghosties when I's young. I couldn' sleep for them. I's\r\nkind of outgrowed them now. But one time me and my younges' chile was\r\ncomin' over to church and right near the dippin' vat is two big gates\r\nand when we git to them, out come a big old white ox, with long legs and\r\nhorns and when he git 'bout halfway, he turns into a man with a Panama\r\nhat on. He follers us to Sandy Creek bridge. Sometimes at night I sees\r\nthat same spirit sittin' on that bridge now.\r\n\r\n\"My old man say, in slavery time, when he's 21, he had to pass a place\r\nwhere patterroles whipped slaves and had kilt some. He was sittin' on a\r\nload of fodder and there come a big light wavin' down the road and\r\nscarin' the team and the hosses drag him and near kilt him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420070\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Adeline Cunningham]\r\n\r\n\r\n     ADELINE CUNNINGHAM, 1210 Florida St., born 1852, was a slave in\r\n     Lavaca County, 4-1/2 miles n.e. of Hallettsville.

Ole man Foley's plantation\r\nrun over Lavaca and Colorado county, he got 1600 acres in one block and\r\nsome of it on de Navidad River. Ole man Foley live in a big log house\r\nwid two double rooms and a hall, and he build a weavin' house agin his\r\nown house and dey's anudder house wid de spinnin' wheels. And ole man\r\nFoley run his own cotton gin and his own grindin' mill where dey grinds\r\nde co'n and dey got a big potato patch.\r\n\r\n\"Dey was rough people and dey treat ev'ry body rough. We lives in de\r\nquarter; de houses all jine close togedder but you kin walk 'tween 'em.\r\nAll de cabins has one room and mostly two fam'lies bunks togedder in de\r\none room wid dirt floors. De slaves builds de cabins, de slaves got no\r\nmoney, dey got no land.\r\n\r\n\"No suh, we never goes to church. Times we sneaks in de woods and prays\r\nde Lawd to make us free and times one of de slaves got happy and made a\r\nnoise dat dey heered at de big house and den de overseer come and whip\r\nus 'cause we prayed de Lawd to set us free.\r\n\r\n\"You know what a stockman is? He is a man dat buys and sells cattle.\r\nEv'ry year de stockman comes to ole man Foley's and he lines us up in de\r\nyard and de stockman got a lotta slaves tied togedder and ole man Foley\r\nhe buys some slaves but he won't sell none. Yassuh, de stockman buys and\r\nsells de slaves jes' de same as cattle.\r\n\r\n\"Dey feeds us well sometimes, if dey warn't mad at us. Dey has a big\r\ntrough jes' like de trough for de pigs and dey has a big gourd and dey\r\ntotes de gourd full of milk and dey breaks de bread in de milk. Den my\r\nmammy takes a gourd and fills it and gives it to us chillun. How's we\r\neat it? We had oyster shells for spoons and de slaves comes in from de\r\nfields and dey hands is all dirty, and dey is hungry. Dey dips de dirty\r\nhands right in de trough and we can't eat none of it. De women wuks in\r\nde fields until dey has chillun and when de chillun's ole enough to wuk\r\nin de fields den de mother goes to ole man Foley's house. Dere she's a\r\nhouse servant and wuks at spinnin' and weavin' de cotton. Dey makes all\r\nde clothes for ole man Foley and his fam'ly and for de slaves.\r\n\r\n\"No suh, we ain't got no holidays. Sundays we grinds co'n and de men\r\nsplit rails and hoes wid de grubbin' hoe. Ole man Foley has a blacksmif\r\nshop and a slave does de blacksmiffin. De slaves builds cabins wid split\r\nlogs and dey makes de roof tight wid co'n shucks and grass. One time a\r\nmonth, times one time in two months, dey takes us to de white folks\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n\"Dey's four or five preachers and de slaves. Iffen deys a marriage de\r\npreacher has a book. He's gotter keep it hid, 'cause dey's afraid iffen\r\nde slaves learns to read dey learns how to run away. One of de slaves\r\nruns away and dey ketches him and puts his eyes out. Dey catches anudder\r\nslave dat run away and dey hanged him up by de arm. Yassuh, I see dat\r\nwid my own eyes; dey holds de slave up by one arm, dey puts a iron on\r\nhis knee and a iron on his feet and drag 'im down but his feet cain't\r\nreach de groun'.\r\n\r\n\"Ole man Foley ain't bad, but de overseers is mean. No suh, we never\r\ngits no money and we never gits no lan'. Ole man Foley, he wants to give\r\nus sumpin for gardens but Mr. John Woods, his gran'son, is agin it.\r\n\r\n\"Was I glad when dat was over? Wouldn' you be? It's long after we's free\r\ndat I gits married. Yassuh, and I live in San Antonio 'bout 20 years.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420035\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Will Daily's House]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Will Daily]\r\n\r\n\r\n     WILL DAILY, was born in 1858 in Missouri, near the city of St.\r\n     Louis. He was a slave of the John Daily family and served as chore\r\n     boy around the house, carried the breakfast to the field and always\r\n     drove up the horses on the plantation. The latter duty developed a\r\n     fondness for horses which led to a career as a race horse rider and\r\n     trainer. He remained with his white folks several years after\r\n     freedom and in Missouri many years longer in this work. He came to\r\n     San Angelo, Texas in 1922 and took up hotel work which he followed\r\n     until his health broke, only a few years ago. He now lives in his\r\n     small home, in the colored district of the city and depends on his\r\n     old age pension for a livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Huh! What you say, did you say somethin' 'bout de ole age pension?\",\r\nquestioned Will when approached on the slavery question, but he answered\r\nreadily, \"Sho! sho' I was a slave an' I aint ashamed to admit dat I\r\nwas. Some of dese here fellers thinks dey sounds ole when dey says dey\r\nwas slaves and dey denies it but I's proud enough of de good treatment\r\nI's got, to allus tell about it. My marster had a driver but he say his\r\nniggers was human, wid human feelin's, so he makes dat driver reports to\r\nhim fer what little thrashin's we gits. Course we had to do de right\r\nthing but jes' some how did, mos' of de time 'cause he was good to us.\r\nSoon as I was big enough, about four or five years ole, ole miss, she\r\nstarts trainin' me fer a house boy. I's a doin' all sorts of chores by\r\nde time I was six years old. Den ole marster he starts sendin' me out on\r\nde plantation to drive up de hosses. I sho' likes dat job 'cause aint\r\nnothin' I loves any better den hosses. Den when I was bigger he starts\r\nme to carryin' de breakfast to de field whar de grown niggers had been\r\nout workin' since way 'fore day. Dey all done dat. Dey say de days\r\nwasn't long enough to put in enough time so dey works part of de night.\r\n\r\n\"We had good grub 'cause we raised all de co'n and de hogs and de cows\r\nand chickens and plenty of everything. Mos' times we have biscuits and\r\nbacon and syrup for breakfast and butter too if we wants it but mos'\r\nniggers dey likes dat fat bacon de bes'.\r\n\r\n\"Our log cabins was good and comfortable. Dey was all along in a row and\r\nbuilt out of de same kind of logs what our marsters house was.\r\n\r\n\"We had good beds and dey was clean.\r\n\r\n\"I nev'r had no money when I was a slave 'cause I was jes' a small boy\r\nwhen de slaves was set free.\r\n\r\n\"We had lots of fish and rabbits, more den we had 'possum but we sho'\r\nlikes dat 'possum when we could git it.\r\n\r\n\"My marster had about three hundred slaves and a big plantation.\r\n\r\n\"I seen some slaves sold off dat big auction block and de little chillun\r\nsho' would be a cryin' when dey takes dere mothers away from dem.\r\n\r\n\"We didn' have no jail 'cause my marster didn' believe dat way, but I's\r\nseen other slaves in dem chains and things.\r\n\r\n\"We didn' know nothin' 'bout no learnin' nor no church neither and when\r\nde slaves die dey was jes' buried without no singin' or nothin'.\r\n\r\n\"When de war started, my father, he goes and once I remember he comes\r\nhome on a furlough and we was all so glad, den when he goes back he gits\r\nkilled and we nev'r see him no mo'.\r\n\r\n\"We had de doctor and good care when we was sick. I's don't remember\r\nmuch 'bout what kinds of medicine we took but I's know it was mostly\r\nhome-made.\r\n\r\n\"We all wears dat asafoetida on a string 'round our necks and sometimes\r\nwe carry a rabbit's foot in our pockets fer good luck.\r\n\r\n\"When de war was ended and de slaves was free old Uncle Pete, our oldest\r\nslave, comes a-walkin' up from de woods whar he always go to keeps from\r\nbein' bothered, to read his Bible, and he had dat Bible under his arm\r\nan' he say, 'I's know somethin', me an' de Lawd knows somethin'', and\r\nden he tells us. He say, 'You all is free people now, you can go when\r\nyou please and come when you pleases and you can stay here or go some\r\nother place'. Well I had to stay 'cause my mother stayed and I's jes'\r\nkeeps on ridin' dem race hosses 'til long after my marster was dead, den\r\nI's gits me some hosses of my own and train other men's hosses too.\r\n\r\n\"I's worked at dat racin' business 'til I's come to Texas and when I\r\nwent to work in hotels dat killed me up. I's done ev'r thing from makin'\r\nsoap fer de scrubbin', to cookin' de bes' meals fer de bes' hotels. I\r\naint been no good since, though, and I had to quit several years ago.\r\n\r\n\"De first time I was married was to Phillis Reed in Missouri and we jes'\r\njumps over de broom, and after Phillis die and I comes to Texas I's gits\r\nmarried again to Susie, here in San Angelo; we jes' jumps ov'r de broom\r\ntoo.

Julia's\r\n     memory fails her when she tries to recall names and dates. She\r\n     still tries to take part in church activities and has recently\r\n     started to learn reading and writing. She lives with a daughter at\r\n     2523 Spring St. Dallas, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"They's lots I disremembers and they's lots I remembers, like the year\r\nthe war's over and the fightin' all done with, 'cause that the year I\r\nlarned to plow and that the time I got married. That's the very year\r\nthey larned me to plow. I larnt all right, 'cause I wasn't one slow to\r\nlarn anything. Afore to that time, they ain't never had no hoe in the\r\nfield for me a-tall. I jes' toted water for the ones in the field.\r\n\r\n\"I had plenty brothers and sisters, 'bout ten of 'em, but I disremembers\r\nsome they names. There was Tom and George and Marthy and Mandy, and\r\nthey's all name' Denman, 'cause my mammy and daddy was Lottie and Boyd\r\nDenman and they come from Georgia to Cherokee County and then to Houston\r\nCounty, near by to Crockett, with Old Man Denman. He was the one owned\r\nall us till he 'vided some with Miss Lizzie when she marries Mr. Cramer.\r\n\r\n\"My daddy worked in the fields with Uncle Lot and my brothers, and my\r\nUncle Joe, he's driver. But Briscoe am overseer and he a white man. He\r\ncan't never whup the growed mens like he wants, 'cause they don't let\r\nhim unless he ask Old Man Denman. I seed him whup 'em, though. He make\r\n'em take off the shirt and whup with the strap.\r\n\r\n\"Now, my mammy was cook in the Denman house and for our family and Uncle\r\nJoe's family. She didn't have much time for anythin' but cookin' all the\r\ntime. But she's the bestes' cook. Us had fine greens and hawgs and beef.\r\nUs et collard greens and pork till us got skittish of it and then they\r\nquit the pork and kilt a beef. When they done that, they's jus' pourin'\r\nwater on our wheels, 'cause us liked best of anythin' the beef, and I do\r\nto this day, only I can't never git it.\r\n\r\n\"Old Man Denman had a boy what kilt squirrels and throwed 'em in the\r\nkitchen. The white folks et them. You ain't never seen no white folks\r\nthen would eat rabbit. I had a brother who hunted. Mostly on Sundays.\r\nHe'd leave for the swamps 'fore daybreak and we'd know when we'd hear\r\nhim callin', 'O-o-o-o-o-da-da-ske-e-e-e-t,' he had somethin'. That jus'\r\na make-up of he own, but we knowed they's rabbits for the pot.\r\n\r\n\"All the mens don't hunt on Sunday, 'cause Uncle Joe helt meetin' in\r\nfront he house. Us look out the door and seed Uncle Joe settin' the\r\nbenches straight and settin' he table out under the trees and sweepin'\r\nclean the leaves and us know they's gwine be meetin'. They's the\r\nloveliest days that ever they was. Night times, too, they'd make it\r\n'tween 'em whether it'd be at our house or Uncle Joe's. We'd ask niggers\r\nfrom other farms and I used to say, 'I likes meetin' jus' as good as I\r\nlikes a party.'\r\n\r\n\"When crops is laid by us have the most parties and dence and sing and\r\nhave play games. The reels is what I used to like but I done quit that\r\nfoolishness many a year ago. I used to cut a step or two. I remembers\r\none reel call the 'Devil's Dream.' It's a fast song\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, de Devil drempt a dream,\r\nHe drempt it on a Friday--\r\nHe drempt he cotch a sinner.'\r\n\r\n\"Old Man Denman am the great one for 'viding he property and when Miss\r\nLizzie marries with Mr. Creame Cramer, which am her dead sister's\r\nhusband, Old Man Denman give me and two my sisters to Miss Lizzie and he\r\ngives two more my sisters to he son. Us goes with Miss Lizzie to the\r\nCramer place and lives in the back yard in a little room by the back\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n\"Everything fine and nice there till one day Miss Lizzie say to me,\r\n'Julia, go down to the well and fetch me some water,' and I goes and I\r\nseed in the road a heap of men all in gray and ridin' hosses, comin' our\r\nway. I runs back to the house and calls Miss Lizzie. She say, 'What you\r\nscairt for?' I tells her 'bout them men and she say they ain't gwine\r\nhurt me none, they jus' wants some water. I goes back to the well and\r\nheared 'em talk 'bout a fight. I goes back to the house and some of the\r\nmens comes to the gate and says to Mr. Cramer, 'How're you, Creame?' He\r\nsay, 'I's all right in my health but I ain't so good in my mind.' They\r\nsays, 'What the matter, Creame?' He say, 'I want to be in the fight so\r\nbad.'\r\n\r\n\"When they goes I asks Miss Lizzie what they fightin' 'bout and she say\r\nit am 'bout money. That all I knows. Right after that Mr. Cramer goes\r\nand we don't never see him no more. Word come back from the fightin' he\r\nmakes some the big, high mens mad and they puts chains 'round he ankles\r\nand make him dig a stump in the hot sun. He ain't used to that and it\r\ngive him fever to the brain and he dies.\r\n\r\n\"When Mr. Cramer goes 'way, Miss Lizzie takes us all and goes back to\r\nOld Man Denman's. The sojers used to pass and all the whoopin' and\r\nhollerin' and carryin' on, you ain't never heered the likes! They\r\nhollers, 'Who-o-o-o, Old Man Denman, how's your chickens?' And they\r\nchunks and throws at 'em till they cripples 'em up and puts 'em in they\r\nbags, for cookin'. Old Man Denman cusses at 'em somethin' powerful.\r\n\r\n\"My sister Mandy and me am down in the woods a good, fur piece from the\r\nhouse and us keeps heerin' a noise. My brother comes down and finds me\r\nand say, 'Come git your dinner.' When I gits there dinner am top the\r\ngate post and he say they's sojers in the woods and they has been\r\npersecutin' a old woman on a mule. She was a nigger woman. I gits so\r\nscairt I can't eat my dinner. I ain't got no heart for victuals. My\r\nbrother say, 'Wait for pa, he comin' with the mule and he'll hide you\r\nout.' I gits on the mule front of pa and us pass through the sojers and\r\nthey grabs at us and says, 'Gimme the gal, gimme the gal.' Pa say I\r\nfaints plumb 'way.\r\n\r\n\"Us heered guns shootin' round and 'bout all the time. Seems like they\r\nfit every time they git a chance. Old Man Denman's boy gits kilt and two\r\nmy sisters he property and they don't know what to do, 'cause they has\r\nto be somebody's property and they ain't no one to 'heritance 'em. They\r\nhas to go to the auction but Old Man Denman say not to fret. At the\r\nauction the man say, 'Goin' high, goin' low, goin' mighty slow, a little\r\nwhile to go. Bid 'em in, bid 'em in. The sun am high, the sun am hot, us\r\ngot to git home tonight.' An old friend of Old Man Denman's hollers out\r\nhe buys for William Blackstone. Us all come home and my sisters too and\r\nOld Man Denman laugh big and say, 'My name allus been William Blackstone\r\nDenman.'\r\n\r\n\"I's a woman growed when the war was to a end. I had my first baby when\r\nI's fourteen. One day my sister call me and say, 'They's fit out, and\r\nthey's been surrenderin' and ain't gwine fight no more.' That dusk Old\r\nMan Denman call all us niggers together and stand on he steps and make\r\nhe speech, 'Mens and womans, you is free as I am. You is free to go\r\nwhere you wants but I is beggin' yous to stay by me till us git the\r\ncrops laid by.' Then he say, 'Study it over 'fore you gives me you\r\nanswer. I is always try as my duty to be fair to you.'\r\n\r\n\"The mens talks it over a-twixt theyselves and includes to stay. They\r\nsays us might as well stay there as go somewhere else, and us got no\r\nmoney and no place to go.\r\n\r\n\"Then Miss Lizzie marries with Mr. Joe McMahon and I goes with her to he\r\nhouse near by and he say he larn me to plow. Miss Lizzie say, 'Now,\r\nJulia, you knows how to plow and don't make no fool of yourself and act\r\nlike you ain't never seed no plow afore.' Us make a corn crop and goes\r\non 'bout same as afore.\r\n\r\n\"I gits married that very year and has a little fixin' for the weddin',\r\nbakes some cakes and I have a dress with buttons and a preacher marries\r\nme. I ain't used to wearin' nothin' but loring (a simple one piece\r\ngarment made from sacking). Unnerwear? I ain't never wore no unnerwear\r\nthen.\r\n\r\n\"My husband rents a little piece of land and us raise a corn crop and\r\nthat's the way us do. Us raises our own victuals. I has 17 chillen\r\nthrough the year and they done scatter to the four winds. Some of them\r\nis dead. I ain't what I used to be for workin'. I jus' set 'round.

Me and my\r\nthree brudders, Peter and Adam and Willie, all lives to be growed and\r\nmarried, but mammy die in slavery and pappy run 'way while he and Massa\r\nBill on they way to the battle of Mansfield. Massa say when he come back\r\nfrom the war, 'That triflin' nigger run 'way and jines up with them damn\r\nYankees.'\r\n\r\n\"Massa have six chillen when war come on and I nussed all of 'em. I\r\nstays in the house with 'em and slep' on a pallet on the floor, and soon\r\nI's big 'nough to tote the milk pail they puts me to milkin', too. Massa\r\nhave more'n 100 cows and most the time me and Violet do all the milkin'.\r\nWe better be in that cowpen by five o'clock. One mornin' massa cotched\r\nme lettin' one the calves do some milkin' and he let me off without\r\nwhippin' that time, but that don't mean he allus good, 'cause them cows\r\nhave more feelin' for than massa and missy.\r\n\r\n\"We et peas and greens and collards and middlin's. Niggers had better\r\nlet that ham alone! We have meal coffee. They parch meal in the oven and\r\nbile it and drink the liquor. Sometime we gits some of the Lincoln\r\ncoffee what was lef' from the nex' plantation.\r\n\r\n\"When the niggers done anything massa bullwhip them, but didn't skin\r\nthem up very often. He'd whip the man for half doin' the plowin' or\r\nhoein' but if they done it right he'd find something else to whip them\r\nfor. At night the men had to shuck corn and the women card and spin. Us\r\ngot two pieces of clothes for winter and two for summer, but us have no\r\nshoes. We had to work Saturday all day and if that grass was in the\r\nfield we didn't git no Sunday, either.\r\n\r\n\"They have dances and parties for the white folks' chillen, but missy\r\nsay, 'Niggers was made to work for white folks,' and on Christmas Miss\r\nIrene bakes two cakes for the nigger families but she darsn't let missy\r\nknow 'bout it.\r\n\r\n\"When a slave die, massa make the coffin hisself and send a couple\r\nniggers to bury the body and say, 'Don't be long,' and no singin' or\r\nprayin' 'lowed, jus' put them in the ground and cover 'em up and hurry\r\non back to that field.\r\n\r\n\"Niggers didn't cou't then like they do now, massa pick out a po'tly man\r\nand a po'tly gal and jist put 'em together. What he want am the stock.\r\n\r\n\"I 'member that fight at Mansfield like it yes'day. Massas's field am\r\nall tore up with cannon holes and ever' time a cannon fire, missy go off\r\nin a rage. One time when a cannon fire, she say to me, 'You li'l black\r\nwench, you niggers ain't gwine be free. You's made to work for white\r\nfolks.' 'Bout that time she look up and see a Yankee sojer standin' in\r\nthe door with a pistol. She say, 'Katie, I didn't say anythin', did I?'\r\nI say, 'I ain't tellin' no lie, you say niggers ain't gwine git free.'\r\n\r\n\"That day you couldn't git 'round the place for the Yankees and they\r\nstays for weeks at a time.\r\n\r\n\"When massa come home from the war he wants let us loose, but missy\r\nwouldn't do it. I stays on and works for them six years after the war\r\nand missy whip me after the war jist like she did 'fore. She has a\r\nhun'erd lashes laid up for me now, and this how it am. My brudders done\r\nlef' massa after the war and move nex' door to the Ware place, and one\r\nSaturday some niggers come and tell me my brudder Peter am comin' to git\r\nme 'way from old missy Sunday night.

There was a\r\nbig box house for a church house and the cullud folks sit off in one\r\ncorner of the church.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes the cullud folks go down in dugouts and hollows and hold they\r\nown service and they used to sing songs what come a-gushin' up from the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"They was 'bout 40 slaves on the place, but I never seed no slaves\r\nbought or sold and I never was sold, but I seen 'em beat--O, Lawd, yes.\r\nI seen 'em make a man put his head through the crack of the rail fence\r\nand then they beat him till he was bloody. They give some of 'em 300 or\r\n400 licks.\r\n\r\n\"Old man Jim, he run away lots and sometimes they git the dogs after\r\nhim. He run away one time and it was so cold his legs git frozen and\r\nthey have to cut his legs off. Sometimes they put chains on runaway\r\nslaves and chained 'em to the house. I never knowed of 'em puttin' bells\r\non the slaves on our place, but over next to us they did. They had a\r\npiece what go round they shoulders and round they necks with pieces up\r\nover they heads and hung up the bell on the piece over they head.\r\n\r\n\"I was a sheep minder them days. The wolves was bad but they never\r\ntackled me, 'cause they'd ruther git the sheep. They like sheep meat\r\nbetter'n man meat. Old Captain wanted me to train he boy to herd sheep\r\nand one day young master see a sow with nine pigs and want me to catch\r\nthem and I wouldn't do it. He tried to beat me up and when we git to the\r\nlot we have to go round to the big gate and he had a pine knot, and he\r\ncatch me in the gate and hit me with that knot. Old Captain sittin' on\r\nthe gallery and he seed it all. When he heered the story he whipped\r\nyoung master and the old lady, she ain't like it.\r\n\r\n\"One time after that she sittin' in the yard knittin' and she throwed\r\nher knittin' needle off and call me to come git it. I done forgot she\r\nwanter whip me and when I bring the needle she grab me and I pull away\r\nbut she hold on my shirt. I run round and round and she call her mother\r\nand they catch and whip me. My shirt just had one button on it and I was\r\npullin' and gnawin' on that button and directly it come off and the\r\nwhole shirt pull off and I didn't have nothin' on but my skin. I run and\r\nclimb up on the pole at the gate and sot there till master come. He say,\r\n'Carey, why you sittin' up there?' Then I tell him the whole\r\ntransaction. I say, 'Missus, she whip me 'cause young marse John git\r\nwhip that time and not me.' He make me git down and git up on his horse\r\nbehin' him and ride up to the big house. Old missus, she done went to\r\nthe house and go to bed with her leg, 'cause when she whippin' me she\r\nstick my head 'tween her knees and when she do that I bit her.\r\n\r\n\"Old master's house was two-story with galleries. My mother, she work in\r\nthe big house and she have a purty good house to live in. It was a plank\r\nhouse, too, but all the other houses was make out of hewed logs. Then my\r\nfather was a carpenter and old master let him have lumber and he make he\r\nown furniture out of dressed lumber and make a box to put clothes in. We\r\nnever did have more'n two changes of clothes.\r\n\r\n\"My father used to make them old Carey plows and was good at makin' the\r\nmould board out of hardwood. He make the best Carey plows in that part\r\nof the country and he make horseshoes and nails and everything out of\r\niron. And he used to make spinning wheels and parts of looms. He was a\r\nvery valuable man and he make wheels and the hub and put the spokes in.\r\n\r\n\"Old master had a big farm and he raised cotton and corn and 'taters and\r\npeanuts and sorghum cane and some ribbon cane. The bigges' crops was\r\ncotton and corn.\r\n\r\n\"My father told us when freedom come. He'd been a free man, 'cause he\r\nwas bodyguard to the old, old master and when he died he give my father\r\nhe freedom. That was over in Richmond, Virginia. But young master steal\r\nhim into slavery again. So he was glad when freedom come and he was free\r\nagain. Old master made arrangement for us to stay with him till after\r\nthe harvest and then we go to the old Rawls house what 'long to Mr. Chiv\r\nRawls. He and my father and mother run the place and it was a big farm.\r\n\r\n\"I git marry when I was 'bout 22 years old and that's her right there\r\nnow. We's been married more'n 60 years and she was 17 years old then.\r\nShe was raised in Grant's colony and her father was a blacksmith.\r\n\r\n\"We had it all 'ranged and we stop the preacher one Sunday mornin' when\r\nhe was on the way to preachin' and he come there to her pa's house and\r\nmarry us. We's had 11 children and all has deceased but three.\r\n\r\n\"I was educated since freedom, 'cause they wasn't no schools in slavery\r\ndays, but after I was freed I went to public schools. Most my learnin' I\r\ngot from a German man what was principal of a college and he teach me\r\nthe biggest part of my education.\r\n\r\n\"When I was 14 a desperado killed my father and then I had my mother and\r\nher eight children to take care of. I worked two months and went to\r\nschool one month and that way I made money to take care of 'em.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420215\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Campbell Davis]\r\n\r\n\r\n     CAMPBELL DAVIS, 85, was born in Harrison Co., Texas, a slave of\r\n     Henry Hood. He remained on the Hood place about three years after\r\n     he was freed, then farmed in Louisiana. In 1873 he married and\r\n     moved back to Harrison Co., where he farmed until old age forced\r\n     him to stop. He now lives with his nephew, Billie Jenkins, near\r\n     Karnack. Campbell receives a $12.00 per month old age pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I's big 'nough in slavery time to hear dem tell de darkies to get up\r\nand go in the mornin', and to hear the whistlin' of dem whips and\r\nhowlin' of de dogs. I's birthed up in the northeast part of this county\r\nright on the line of Louisiana and Texas, and 'longed to old man Henry\r\nHood. My mammy and daddy was Campbell and Judy Davis and dey both come\r\nfrom Alabama, and was brung here by de traders and sold to Massa Hood.\r\nThey was nine of us chillen, name Ellis and Hildaman and Henderson and\r\nHenrietta and Georgia and Harriet and Patsy.\r\n\r\n\"Massa Henry didn't have de fine house but it a big one. Us quarters sot\r\noff 'cross de field in de edge of a skit of woods. Dey have dirt floors\r\nand a fireplace and old pole and plank bunks nail to de walls.\r\n\r\n\"Dey fed us beef and veg'tables--any kind, jus' name it--and 'low us sop\r\nbread in potlicker till de world look level.

One my uncles de driver, and\r\nmassa blow de old conk shell long 'fore day, and if de darkies didn't\r\ngit goin' you'd hear dem whips crackin'.\r\n\r\n\"I seed one my sisters whip 'cause she didn't spin 'nough. Dey pull de\r\nclothes down to her waist and laid her down on de stomach and lash her\r\nwith de rawhide quirt. I's in de field when dey whips my Uncle Lewis for\r\nnot pickin' 'nough cotton. De driver pull he clothes down and make him\r\nlay on de groun'. He wasn't tied down, but he say he scart to move.\r\n\r\n\"De women am off Friday afternoon to wash clothes and all de hands git\r\nSaturday afternoon and mos' de man go huntin' or fishin'. Sometimes dey\r\nhave parties Saturday night and couples git on de floor and have music\r\nof de fiddle and banjo.

He 'lieve in makin' dem work\r\nand when dey need whippin' he done it, but when it come to feedin' he\r\ndone dat right, too. And on Christmas he give us clothes and shoes and\r\nnuts and things and 'nother big dinner, and on Christmas night de\r\ndarkies sing songs for de white folks.\r\n\r\n\"Us git some book larnin' 'mongst ourselves, round de quarters, and have\r\nour own preacher. Mos' de time us chillen play, makin' frog holes in de\r\nsand and mud people and things.\r\n\r\n\"I done hear lots of talk 'bout ghosts and hants and think I seed one\r\nonct. I's comin' home from de neighbors at night, in de moonlight, and\r\n'rectly I seed something white by side de road. De closer I gits de\r\nbigger it gits. I's scart but I walks up to it and it nothin' but de big\r\nspiderweb on de bush. Den I says to myself, 'Dere ain't nothin' to dis\r\nghost business.'\r\n\r\n\"Massa have one son go to war and he taken a old cullud man with him. I\r\nseed soldiers on hosses comin' and goin' de big road, and lots of dem\r\ncome to Port Caddo in boats. De pretties' sight I ever seed am a soldier\r\nband all dress in de uniforms with brass buttons. When de soldiers come\r\nback from de war dey throwed cannon balls 'long de road and us chillen\r\nplay with dem.\r\n\r\n\"When de war am over, massa call us all and say we's free, but can stay\r\non and work for de victuals and clothes. A bunch leaves and go to de\r\nProgoe Marshal at Shreveport and ask him what to do. He tell dem to go\r\nback and wait till dey find work some place. My mammy and me stays at de\r\nHood place 'bout three years. When I's twenty-one I marries and come\r\nback to Harrison County.

I looks at him and says to\r\nmyself, 'Thank de Lawd I knows better'n dat.' When I's comin' up it am\r\ndark, but I knows better things am ahead for us people and us trusts in\r\nde Lawd and was hones' with our white folks and profits by what dey\r\ntells us. Dey wasn't no niggers sent to jail when I's comin' up. It dis\r\n'style and brightness' what gits de young niggers in trouble.

His family were the only slaves owned by Jonathan\r\n     Draper, Baptist minister. In 1869 William joined the army and was\r\n     stationed at Fort Stockton, Texas. He has lived in Houston since\r\n     1870. William is active and takes a long, daily walk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well, suh, jes' sit down in de chair yonder and I'll tell you what I\r\ncan 'bout times back yonder. Let's see, now. I was born on de first day\r\nof April in 1845. De reason I knows was 'cause Miss Lizzie, our missy,\r\ntold me so when we was sot free. Mammy done told me I was born den, on\r\nde Tennessee river, near Kingston. I heared her say de turnpike what run\r\npast Massa John's house dere goes over de mountain to Bristol, over in\r\nVirginny. Mammy and pappy and all us chillen 'long to de Drapers, Massa\r\nJonathan what us call Massa John, and he wife, Miss Lizzie, and we is de\r\nonly cullud folks what dey owns.\r\n\r\n\"Massa John am de Baptist preacher, and while I'm sho' glad to see my\r\nfolks sot free, I'll tell de truth and say Massa John and Miss Lizzie\r\nwas mighty good to us. Dey have four chillen; Massa Milton, what am\r\noldes' and kill in de first battle; Massa Bob and Massa George and Massa\r\nCanero. Oh, yes, dey have one gal, Missy Ann.\r\n\r\n\"Course us didn't have no last names like now. Mammy named Sophie and\r\npappy named Billy. Sometimes de owners give de slaves last names\r\n'cordin' to what dey do, like pappy was meat cook and mammy cook pies\r\nand cakes and bread, so dey might have Cook for de last name.\r\n\r\n\"We has a bigger family dan Massa John, 'cause dey eight of us chillen.\r\nI ain't seen none of dem since I lef' Virginny in 1869, but I 'member\r\nall de names. Dere was Jane and Lucy and Ellen and Bob and Solomon and\r\nAlbert and John, and I'm de younges' de whole lot.\r\n\r\n\"I heared Miss Lizzie tell some white folks dat my mammy and pappy give\r\nto her by her pappy in Alabama when she get married. Dat de custom with\r\nrich folks den, and mammy 'long to de Ames, what was Miss Lizzie's name\r\n'fore she marry. I heared her say when de stars falls, I think she say\r\nin 1832, she was 'bout eighteen, and dey think de world am endin'.\r\n\r\n\"Pappy was a Indian. I knows dat. He came from Congo, over in Africa,\r\nand I heared him say a big storm druv de ship somewhere on de Ca'lina\r\ncoast. I 'member he mighty 'spectful to Massa and Missy, but he proud,\r\ntoo, and walk straighter'n anybody I ever seen. He had scars on de right\r\nside he head and cheek what he say am tribe marks, but what dey means I\r\ndon't know.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout de first I 'members real good am where we am in Virginny and\r\nMassa John runs de Washington College, in Washington County. I 'member\r\nall de pupils eats at massa's house and dat de first job I ever had.\r\n'Scuse me for laughin', but I don't reckon I thunk of dat since de Lawd\r\nknow when. Dat my first job. Dey has a string fasten to de wall on one\r\nside de room, with pea fowl tail feathers strung 'long it, and it runs\r\nmost de length de room, above de dinin' table, and round a pulley-like\r\npiece in de ceilin' with one end de string hangin' down. When mealtime\r\ncome, I am put where de string hang down and I pulls it easy like, and\r\nde feathers swishes back and forth sideways, and keeps de flies from\r\nlightin' while folks am eatin'. 'Ceptin' dat, all I does is play round\r\nwith Massa George and Missy Ann.\r\n\r\n\"Dey ain't no whuppin' on our place and on Sunday us all go to church,\r\nand Massa John do de preachin'. Dey rides in de buggy and us follow in\r\nde wagon. De white folks sets in front de church and us in back.\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you how long us stay at de college, 'zactly, but us moves\r\nto Warm Springs to take de baths and drink de water, in Scott County.\r\nDat two, three years befo' de war, and Massa John run de hotel and\r\npreach on Sunday. I think dere am three springs, one sulphur water and\r\none lime water and one a warm spring. I does a little bit of everything\r\nround de hotel, helps folks off de stage when it druv up, wait on table\r\nand sich. When I hears de horn blow--you know, de stage driver blow it\r\nwhen dey top de hill 'bout two miles 'way, to let you know dey comin'--I\r\nsho' hustle round and git ready to meet it, 'cause most times folks what\r\nI totes de grips for gives me something. Dat de first money I ever seed.\r\nSome de folks gives me de picayune--dat what us call a nickel, now, and\r\nsome gives me two shillin's, what same as two-bits now. A penny was big\r\nden, jes' like a two-bit piece, now.\r\n\r\n\"But when war begin 'tween de Yankees and de South, it sho' change\r\neverything up, 'cause folks quit comin' to de Springs and de soldiers\r\ntakes over de place. Massa Milton go to jine de South Army and gits\r\nkill. Morgan and he men make de Springs headquarters most de war, till\r\nde Yankees come marchin' through toward de last part. I know pappy say\r\ndem Yankees gwine win, 'cause dey allus marchin' to de South, but none\r\nde South soldiers marches to de North. He didn't say dat to de white\r\nfolks, but he sho' say it to us. When de Yankees come marchin' through,\r\nde Morgan soldiers jes' hide out till dey gone. Dey never done no\r\nfightin' round Warm Springs. Lots of times dey goes way for couple weeks\r\nand den comes back and rests awhile.\r\n\r\n\"Den one mornin'--I 'members it jes' like it yestiddy, it de fourth of\r\nJuly in 1865--Miss Lizzie say to me, 'Willie, I wants you to git you\r\npapa and de rest de family and have dem come to de porch right away.' I\r\nscurries round quick like and tells dem and she comes out of de house\r\nand says, 'Now, de Yankees done sot you free and you can do what you\r\nwants, but you gwineter see more carpet baggers and liars dan you ever\r\nhas seed, and you'll be worse off den you ever has been, if you has\r\nanythin' to do with dem. Den she opens de book and tells us all when us\r\nborn and how old us am, so us have some record 'bout ourselves. She\r\ntells me I'm jes' nineteen and one fourth years old when I'm sot free.\r\n\r\n\"She tell pappy Massa John want to see him in de house and when he comes\r\nout he tells us Massa John done told him to take a couple wagons and de\r\nfamily and go to de farm 'bout ten miles 'way on Possum Creek and work\r\nit and stay long as he wants. Massa has us load up one wagon with\r\n'visions. Pappy made de first crop with jes' hoes, 'cause us didn't have\r\nno hosses or mules to plow with. Us raise jes' corn and some wheat, but\r\ndey am fruit trees, peaches and apples and pears and cherries. Massa\r\nJohn pay pappy $120 de year, 'sides us 'visions, and us stays dere till\r\npappy dies in 1868.\r\n\r\n\"Den I heared 'bout de railroad what dey buildin' at Knoxville and I\r\nleaves de folks and gits me de job totin' water. Dey asks my name and I\r\nsays William Davis, 'cause I knows Mr. Jefferson Davis am President of\r\nde South durin' de war, and I figgers it a good name. In 1869 I goes to\r\nNashville and 'lists in de army. I'm in de 24th Infantry, Company G, and\r\nus sent to Fort Stockton to guard de line of Texas, but all us do am\r\nbuild 'dobe houses. Col. Wade was de commander de fort and Cap'n\r\nJohnson was captain of G. Co. Out dere I votes for de first time, for\r\nGen. Grant, when Greeley and him run for president. But I gits sick at\r\nde Fort and am muster out in 1870 and comes to Houston.\r\n\r\n\"I gits me de deckhand job on de Dinah, de steamboat what haul freight\r\nand passengers 'tween Galveston and Houston. Den I works on de Lizzie,\r\nwhat am a bigger boat. Course, Houston jes' a little bit of place to\r\nwhat it am now--dey wasn't no git buildin's like dey is now, and mud, I\r\ntell you de streets was jes' like de swamp when it rain.\r\n\r\n\"Long 'bout 1875 I gits marry to Mary Jones, but she died in 1883 and I\r\ngits marry 'gain in 1885 to Arabelle Wilson and has four girls and one\r\nboy from her. She died 'bout ten years back. Course, us cullud folks\r\nmarry jes' like white folks do now, but I seen cullud folks marry 'fore\r\nde war and massa marry dem dis way: dey goes in de parlor and each carry\r\nde broom. Dey lays de brooms on de floor and de woman put her broom\r\nfront de man and he put he broom front de woman. Dey face one 'nother\r\nand step 'cross de brooms at de same time to each other and takes hold\r\nof hands and dat marry dem. Dat's de way dey done, sho', 'cause I seed\r\nmy own sister marry dat way.\r\n\r\n\"I has wished lots of times to go back and see my folks, but I never has\r\nbeen back and never seed dem since I left, and I guess dey am all gone\r\n'long 'fore now. I has jobbed at first one thing and 'nother and like\r\npappy tells me, I has trials and tribulations and I has good chillen\r\nwhat ain't never got in no trouble and what all helps take care dere old\r\npappy so I guess I ain't got no complainin' 'bout things.\r\n\r\n\"I dreams sometimes 'bout de peach trees and de pear trees and de cherry\r\ntrees and I'd give lots to see de mountains 'gain, 'cause when de frost\r\ncome, 'bout now, de leaves on de trees put on pretty colors and de\r\npersimmons and nuts is ready for pickin' and a little later on us kill\r\nde hawgs and put by de meat for de winter.\r\n\r\n\"De Lawd forgive me for dis foolishness, 'cause I got a good home, and\r\nhas all I need, but I gits to thinkin' 'bout Virginny sometimes and my\r\nfolks what I ain't seed since I left, and it sho' make me want to see it\r\nonce more 'fore I die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420281\r\n\r\n\r\n     ELI DAVISON was born in Dunbar, West Virginia, a slave of Will\r\n     Davison. Eli has a bill of sale that states he was born in 1844.\r\n     His master moved to Texas in 1858, and settled in Madison County.\r\n     Eli lives in Madisonville, with one of his sons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My first Old Marse was Will Davison. My father's name was Everett Lee\r\nand mama was Susan, and he come to see her twict a month, 'cause he was\r\nowned by 'nother master.\r\n\r\n\"Marse Davison had a good home in West Virginia, where I's born, in\r\nDunbar, but most of it 'longed to he wife and she was the boss of him.\r\nHe had a great many slaves, and one mornin' he got up and 'vided all he\r\nhad and told his wife she could have half the slaves. Then we loaded two\r\nwagons and he turned to his oldest son and the next son and said, 'You's\r\ngwine with me. Crawl on.' Then he said to he wife, 'Elsie, you can have\r\neverything here, but I'm takin' Eli and Alex and these here two\r\nchillen.' The other two gals and two boys he left, and pulled out for\r\nTexas. It taken us mos' two years to git here, and Marse Will never sot\r\neyes on the rest of his family no more, long as he lived.\r\n\r\n\"Marse never married any more. He'd say, 'They ain't 'nother woman under\r\nthe sun I'd let wear my name.' He never said his wife's name no more,\r\nbut was allus talkin' of them chillun he done left behind.\r\n\r\n\"We gits here and starts to build a one room log house for Marse Will\r\nand his two boys. My quarters was one them covered wagons, till he\r\ntrades me off. He cried like a baby, but he said, 'I hate to do this,\r\nbut its the only way I'll have anything to leave for my two boys.' Looks\r\nlike everything done go 'gainst him when he come to Texas, and he took\r\nsick and died. The boys put him away nice and loaded up and went back\r\nto Virginia, but the home was nailed up and farm lying out, and it took\r\nthem mos' a year to find they folks. The mother and one gal was dead, so\r\nthey come back and lived and died here in Texas.\r\n\r\n\"Marse Will was one more good man back in Virginia. He never got mad or\r\nwhipped a slave. He allus had plenty to eat, with 1,200 acres, but after\r\nwe come here all we had to eat was what we kilt in the woods and\r\ncornbread. He planted seven acres in corn, but all he did was hunt deer\r\nand squirrels. They was never a nigger what tried to run off in Texas,\r\n'cause this was a good country, plenty to eat by huntin' and not so cold\r\nlike in Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"After I was traded off, my new master wasn't so good to me. He thunk\r\nall the time the South would win that war and he treated us mean. His\r\nname was Thomas Greer. He kept tellin' us a black nigger never would be\r\nfree. When it come, he said to us, 'Well, you black ----, you are just\r\nas free as I am.' He turnt us loose with nothin' to eat and mos' no\r\nclothes. He said if he got up nex' mornin' and found a nigger on his\r\nplace, he'd horsewhip him.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what I'd done, but one my old Marse Will's chillun done\r\nsettle close by and they let me work for them, and built me a log house\r\nand I farmed on halves. They stood good for all the groceries I buyed\r\nthat year. It took all I made that year to pay my debts and that's the\r\nway its been ever since.\r\n\r\n\"I married Sarah Keys. We had a home weddin' and 'greed to live together\r\nas man and wife. I jus' goes by her home one day and captures her like.\r\nI puts her on my saddle behind me and tells her she's my wife then.\r\nThat's all they was to my weddin'. We had six chillun and they's all\r\nfarmin' round here. Sarah, she dies seventeen years ago and I jus' lives\r\nround with my chillen, 'cause I's too old to do any work.\r\n\r\n\"All I ever done was to farm. That's all this here nigger knew what to\r\ndo. O, I's seed the time when I never had nothin' to eat and my big\r\nbunch of chillun cryin' for bread. I could go to the woods then, but you\r\ncan't git wild game no more. In them days it was five or ten mile to\r\nyour nearest neighbor, but now they's so close you can stand in your\r\nyard and talk to them.\r\n\r\n\"I never done no votin', 'cause them Klu Kluxers was allus at the votin'\r\nplaces for a long time after the niggers was freed. The niggers has got\r\non since them old days. They has gone from nothin' to a fair educated\r\nfolks. We has been kind of slow, 'cause we was turnt loose without\r\nnothin', and couldn't read and write.\r\n\r\n\"I's worked for fifteen and thirty cents a day, but Lawd, blessed to our\r\npresident, we gits a li'l pension now and that's kep' me from plumb\r\nstarvin' to death. Times is hard and folks had to do away with\r\neverything when they had that Hoover for president, but they will be\r\nstraightened out by and by if they'll listen to the president now.\r\n'Course, some wants to kill him, 'cause he helps the poor, but it do\r\nlook like we ought to have a li'l bread and salt bacon without upsettin'\r\n'em, when they has so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420162\r\n\r\n\r\n     ELIGE DAVISON was born in Richmond, Virginia, a slave of George\r\n     Davison. Elige worked in the field for some time before he was\r\n     freed, but does not know his age. He lives with one of his\r\n     grandsons, in Madisonville, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My birth was in Richmond. That's over in old Virginny, and George\r\nDavison owned me and my pappy and mammy. I 'member one sister, named\r\nFelina Tucker.\r\n\r\n\"Massa and Missus were very good white folks and was good to the black\r\nfolks. They had a great big rock house with pretty trees all round it,\r\nbut the plantation was small, not more'n a hunerd acres. Massa growed\r\ntobaccy on 'bout 30 of them acres, and he had a big bunch of hawgs. He\r\nwaked us up 'bout four in the mornin' to milk the cows and feed them\r\nhawgs.\r\n\r\n\"Our quarters was good, builded out of pine logs with a bed in one\r\ncorner, no floors and windows. Us wore old loyal clothes and our shirt,\r\nit open all down the front. In winter massa gave us woolen clothes to\r\nwear. Us didn't know what shoes was, though.\r\n\r\n\"Massa, he look after us slaves when us sick, 'cause us worth too much\r\nmoney to let die jus' like you do a mule. He git doctor or nigger mammy.\r\nShe make tea out of weeds, better'n quinine. She put string round our\r\nneck for chills and fever, with camphor on it. That sho' keep off\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n\"Us work all day till jus' 'fore dark. Sometimes us got whippin's. We\r\ndidn't mind so much. Boss, you know how stubborn a mule am, he have to\r\nbe whipped. That the way slaves is.\r\n\r\n\"When you gather a bunch of cattle to sell they calves, how the calves\r\nand cows will bawl, that the way the slaves was then. They didn't know\r\nnothin' 'bout they kinfolks. Mos' chillen didn't know who they pappy was\r\nand some they mammy 'cause they taken 'way from the mammy when she wean\r\nthem, and sell or trade the chillen to someone else, so they wouldn't\r\ngit 'tached to they mammy or pappy.\r\n\r\n\"Massa larn us to read and us read the Bible. He larn us to write, too.\r\nThey a big church on he plantation and us go to church and larn to tell\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\n\"I seed some few run away to the north and massa sometime cotch 'em and\r\nput 'em in jail. Us couldn't go to nowhere without a pass. The\r\npatterrollers would git us and they do plenty for nigger slave. I's went\r\nto my quarters and be so tired I jus' fall in the door, on the ground,\r\nand a patterroller come by and hit me several licks with a\r\ncat-o-nine-tails, to see if I's tired 'nough to not run 'way. Sometimes\r\nthem patterrollers hit us jus' to hear us holler.\r\n\r\n\"When a slave die, he jus' 'nother dead nigger. Massa, he builded a\r\nwooden box and put the nigger in and carry him to the hole in the\r\nground. Us march round the grave three times and that all.\r\n\r\n\"I been marry once 'fore freedom, with home weddin'. Massa, he bring\r\nsome more women to see me. He wouldn't let me have jus' one woman. I\r\nhave 'bout fifteen and I don't know how many chillen. Some over a\r\nhunerd, I's sho'.\r\n\r\n\"I 'member plenty 'bout the war, 'cause the Yankees they march on to\r\nRichmond. They kill everything what in the way. I heared them big guns\r\nand I's scart. Everybody scart. I didn't see no fightin', 'cause I gits\r\nout the way and keeps out till it all over.\r\n\r\nBut when they marches right on the town I's tendin' hosses for massa. He\r\nhave two hosses kilt right under him. Then the Yankees, they capture\r\nthat town. Massa, he send me to git the buggy and hoss and carry missus\r\nto the mountain, but them Yankees they capture me and say they gwine\r\nhang that nigger. But, glory be, massa he saves me 'fore they hangs me.\r\nHe send he wife and my wife to 'nother place then, 'cause they burn\r\nmassa's house and tear down all he fences.\r\n\r\n\"When the war over massa call me and tells me I's free as he was, 'cause\r\nthem Yankees win the war. He give me $5.00 and say he'll give me that\r\nmuch a month iffen I stays with him, but I starts to Texas. I heared I\r\nwouldn't have to work in Texas, 'cause everything growed on trees and\r\nthe Texans wore animal hides for clothes. I didn't git no land or mule\r\nor cow. They warn't no plantations divided what I knowed 'bout. Mos'\r\nniggers jus' got turn loose with a cuss, and not 'nough clothes to cover\r\nthey bodies.\r\n\r\n\"It 'bout a year 'fore I gits to Texas. I walks nearly all the way.\r\nSometimes I git a li'l ride with farmer. Sometimes I work for folks\r\n'long the way and git fifty cents and start 'gain.\r\n\r\n\"I got to Texas and try to work for white folks and try to farm. I\r\ncouldn't make anything at any work. I made $5.00 a month for I don't\r\nknow how many year after the war. Iffen the woods wasn't full of wild\r\ngame us niggers all starve to death them days.\r\n\r\n\"I been marry three time. First wife Eve Shelton. She run off with\r\n'nother man. Then I marries Fay Elly. Us sep'rate in a year. Then I\r\nmarry Parlee Breyle. No, I done forgot. 'Fore that I marries Sue\r\nWilford, and us have seven gals and six boys. They all in New York but\r\none. He stays here. Then I marries Parlee and us have two gals. Parlee\r\ndie three year ago.\r\n\r\n\"The gov'ment give me a pension and I gits li'l odd jobs round, to get\r\nby. But times been hard and I ain't had much to eat the las' few years.\r\nNot near so good as what old massa done give me. But I gits by somehow.\r\n\r\n\"I done the bes' I could, 'sidering I's turned out with nothin' when I's\r\ngrowed and didn't know much, neither. The young folks, they knows more,\r\n'cause they got the chance for schoolin'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420278\r\n\r\n\r\n     JOHN DAY, 81, was born near Dayton, Tennessee, a slave of Major\r\n     John Day. John lives in McLennan Co., Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I was born near three mile from Dayton. That's over in Tennessee, and\r\nit was the sixteenth of February, in 1856. Master's name was Major John\r\nDay and my father's name was Alfred Day, and he was a first-class\r\nblacksmith. Blacksmithin' was a real trade them days, and my father made\r\naxes and hoes and plow shares and knives and even Jew's harps.\r\n\r\n\"Master was good to my father and when he done done de day's work he\r\ncould work and keep the money he made. He'd work till midnight,\r\nsometimes, and at de end that war he had fifteen hundred dollars in\r\nConfederate money. I never seen such a worker.\r\n\r\n\"Master John thunk lots of father but he took de notion to sell him one\r\ntime, 'cause why, he could git a lot of money for him. He sold him, but\r\nmy mama and even Old Missy, cried and took on so dat Master John went\r\nafter de men what bought him, to git him back. Dey already done crossed\r\nde river, but master calls and dey brung my father back and he give dem\r\nde money back. Dat de only time master sold one of us.\r\n\r\n\"He was a preacher and good to us, never beat none of us. He didn't have\r\nno overseer, but saw to all de work heself. He had twenty-five slaves\r\nand raised wheat and corn and oats and vegetables and fruit. He had four\r\nhundred acres and a house with twelve rooms.\r\n\r\n\"A man what owned a farm jinin' ourn, de houses half a mile apart. He\r\nhad two slaves, Taylor and Jennie, and he whip dem every day, even if\r\ndey hadn't done nothin'. He allus beatin' on dem, seemed like. One awful\r\ncold day in February, Taylor done go to Denton for somethin', and when\r\nhe come back his master starts beatin' on him, and cursed him somethin'\r\nawful. He kep' it up till my mama, her name was Mariah, gits a butcher\r\nknife and runs out dere and say, 'Iffen you hits him 'nother lick, I'll\r\nuse this on you.' Old Missy was watchin' and backed her up. So he quit\r\nbeatin' on Taylor dat time. But one day dat white man's own son say to\r\nhim, 'Iffen you don't quit beatin' on dem niggers, I'll knock you in de\r\nhead.' Den he quit.\r\n\r\n\"Master was in de Confederate army. He gits to be a major and after he\r\ndone come out dat war he sho' hated anythin' what was blue color. I got\r\nhold a old Yankee cap and coat and is wearin' dem and master yanks dem\r\noff and burns dem.\r\n\r\n\"We heared dem guns in de Lookout Mountain battle. Dey sounded like\r\nthunder, rumblin' low. One day de Feds done take Dayton and de soldiers\r\ngoes by our place to drive dem Feds out. Dere a valley 'bout two miles\r\nwide 'twixt our place and Dayton and we could see de Confederate\r\nsoldiers till dey go up de hill on de other side. Long in evenin' de\r\nConfederates come back through dat valley and they was travelin' with\r\ndem Yankees right after dem. Dey come by our house and we was gittin'\r\nout de way, all right. Old Missy took all us chillen, black and white,\r\nand puts us under half a big hogshead, down in de stormhouse.\r\n\r\n\"De Yankees got to de place and 'gin ransack it. Old Missy done lock dat\r\nstormhouse door and sot down on it and she wouldn't git up when dey done\r\ntell her to. So dey takes her by de arms and lifts her off it. Dey\r\ndidn't hurt her any. Den dey brekks de lock and comes down in dere. I\r\ndidn't see whay dey hadn't found us kids, 'cause my heart beatin' like\r\nde hammer. Dey turned dat hogshead over and all us kids skinned out dere\r\nlike de Devil after us. One de Yanks hollers, 'Look what we done hatch\r\nout!'\r\n\r\n\"I tore out past de barn, thinkin' I'd go to mama, in de field, but it\r\nlook like all de Yanks in de world jumpin' dere hosses over dat fence,\r\nso I whirls round and run in dat barn and dives in a stack of hay and\r\nburies myself so deep de folks like to never found me. Dey hunted all\r\nover de place befo' dey done found me. Us kids scart 'cause we done see\r\ndem Yanks' bayonets and thunk dey was dere horns.\r\n\r\n\"Dem Yanks done take all de flour and meal and wheat and corn and smoked\r\nmeat. After dat master fixes up a place in de ceilin' to store stuff,\r\nand a trap door so when it closed you couldn't tell its dere.\r\n\r\n\"I lives in and round de old place till 1910, den comes to Texas. I jist\r\nworks round and farms and gits by, but I ain't never done nothin' worth\r\ntellin'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420257\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nelsen Denson]\r\n\r\n\r\n     NELSEN DENSON, 90, was born near Hambirg, Arkansas, a slave of Jim\r\n     Nelson, who sold Nelsen and his family to Felix Grundy. Nelsen's\r\n     memory is poor, but he managed to recall a few incidents. He now\r\n     lives in Waco, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I'll be ninety years old this December, (1937). I was born in Arkansas,\r\nup in Ashley County, and it was the twenty-second day of December in\r\n1847. My mammy was from Virginny and pappy was from old Kentucky, and I\r\nwas one of they eight chillen. Our owner, Marse Jim Densen, brung us to\r\nTexas and settled near Marlin, but got in debt and sold as all to Marse\r\nFelix Grundy, and he kep' us till freedom, and most of us worked for him\r\nafter that.\r\n\r\n\"Marse Jim Densen had a easy livin' in Arkansas, but folks everywhere\r\nwas comin' to Texas and he 'cides to throw in his fortunes. It wasn't so\r\nlong after that war with Mexico and folks come in a crowd to 'tect\r\ntheyselves 'gainst Indians and wild animals. The wolves was the worst to\r\nsmell cookin' and sneak into camp, but Indians come up and makes the\r\npeace sign and has a pow wow with the white folks. Marse git beads or\r\ncloth and trade for leather breeches and things.\r\n\r\n\"I want to tell how we crosses the Red River on de Red River Raft. Back\r\nin them days the Red River was near closed up by dis timber raft and de\r\nbig boats couldn't git up de river at all. We gits a li'l boat, and a\r\nCaddo Indian to guide us. Dis Red River raft dey say was centuries old.\r\nDe driftwood floatin' down de river stops in de still waters and makes a\r\nbunch of trees and de dirt 'cumulates, and broomstraws and willows and\r\nbrush grows out dis rich dirt what cover de driftwood. Dis raft growed\r\n'bout a mile a year and de oldes' timber rots and breaks away, but dis\r\nnot fast 'nough to keep de river clear. We found bee trees on de raft\r\nand had honey.\r\n\r\n\"It was long time after us come to Texas when de gov'ment opens up de\r\nchannel. Dat am in 1873. 'Fore dat, a survey done been made and dey\r\nfound de raft am a hundred and twenty-eight miles long. When we was on\r\ndat raft it am like a big swamp, with trees and thick brush and de\r\ndriftwood and logs all wedge up tight 'tween everything.\r\n\r\n\"'Fore Texas secedes, Marse Jensen done sell us all to Marse Felix\r\nGrundy, and he goes to war in General Hardeman's Brigade and is with him\r\nfor bodyguard. When de battle of Mansfield come I'm sixteen years old.\r\nWe was camped on the Sabine River, on the Texas side, and the Yanks on\r\nthe other side a li'l ways. I 'member the night 'fore the battle, how\r\nthe campfires looked, and a quiet night and the whippoorwills callin' in\r\nthe weeds. We was 'spectin' a 'tack and sings to keep cheerful. The\r\nYanks sings the 'Battle Cry of Freedom' when they charges us. They come\r\non and on and, Lawd, how they fit! I stays clost to Marse Grundy and the\r\nrebels wins and takes 'bout a thousand Yanks.\r\n\r\n\"Most the slaves was happy, the ones I knowed. They figgers the white\r\nmen fightin' for some principal, but lots of them didn't care nothin'\r\n'bout bein' free. I s'pose some was with bad white folks, but not round\r\nus. We had more to eat and now I'm so old I wouldn't feel bad if I had\r\nold marse to look after me 'gain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n420131\r\n\r\n\r\n     VICTOR DUHON was born 97 years ago in Lafayette Parish, La., a\r\n     slave of the Duhon family. His blue eyes and almost white skin are\r\n     evidence of the white strain in his blood. Even after many years of\r\n     association with English speaking persons, he speaks a French\r\n     patois, and his story was interpreted by a Beaumont French teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"My papa was Lucien Duhon and my mama Euripe Dupuis. I was born over in\r\nLouisiana in Lafayette Parish, between Broussard and Warville. I'm 97\r\nyears old now.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't have brothers or sisters, except half ones. It is like this,\r\nmy mama was a house servant in the Duhon family. She was the\r\nhairdresser. One day she barbered master's son, who was Lucien. He says\r\nthat he'll shave her head if she won't do what he likes. After that she\r\nhis woman till he marries a white lady.\r\n\r\n\"My grandmama was stolen from Africa and she lived to be 125 years old.\r\nShe died last year in April. I think I'll live long as she did. There\r\nwere fifteen slaves on the land what Duhon's had but I never ran around\r\nwith them. I had room at the back of the big house. You know, Madame\r\nDuhon was my grandmama. She was good to me. The only thing I did was\r\nlook to my master's horse and be coachman for Madame. Master had four\r\nsons. They were Ragant and Jaques and Lucien and Desire. Desire was shot\r\nat the dance.\r\n\r\n\"Master had about 100 acres in cotton and the corn. He had a slave for\r\nto hunt all the time. He didn't do other things. The partridge and the\r\nrice birds he killed were cooked for the white folks. The owls and the\r\nrabbits and the coons and the possums were cooked for us. They had a big\r\nroom for us to eat in. Where they cook they had a long oven with a piece\r\ndown the middle. They cooked the white folks things on one side. They\r\ncooked their own things on the other. They had each ones pots and\r\nskillets.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't play much with the black children. My time went waiting on my\r\nwhite folks.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes the priest came to say Mass. The slaves went to Mass. The\r\npriest married and baptized the slaves. They gave a feast of baptizing.\r\nWe all had real beef meat that day.\r\n\r\n\"When my mama had 22 years she married a Polite Landry slave. Then she\r\nwent to the Landry plantation. There was often marrying between the two\r\nplantations. When they married the wife went to her man's plantation.\r\nThat made no difference. It wouldn't be long before a girl from the\r\nother place marry into the man's plantation. That kept things in\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\n\"My mama married Fairjuste Williams. They had two sons and a daughter. I\r\ndidn't know them so much. They were half brothers and sister.\r\n\r\n\"I had 22 years when war came. You know what war I mean. The war when\r\nthe slaves were set free. I wasn't bothered about freedom. Didn't leave\r\nmaster till he died. Then I went to work for Mr. Polite Landry.\r\n\r\n\"I was always in good hands. Some slaves ware treated bad. Mr. Natale\r\nVallean beat up a slave for stealing. He beat him so hard he lay in\r\nfront of the gate a whole day and the night.\r\n\r\n\"I worked on farms all my life. Then I came to Beaumont. About 23 years\r\nago, it was. I worked at anything. Now I'm too old. I live with my\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                                                              |\r\n| Transcriber's Corrections:                                   |\r\n|                                                              |\r\n|                                                              |\r\n| Page 3: Then (and weepin' when they sot us free.
